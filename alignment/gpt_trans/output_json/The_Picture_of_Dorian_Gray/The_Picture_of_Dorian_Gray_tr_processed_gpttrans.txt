<t0>First chapter</t0>
<t1>The studio was filled with the languid scent of roses; when a light summer breeze wandered among the trees in the garden, the heavy fragrance of lilacs or the more delicate perfume of pink-flowered thorn trees wafted in through the open door.</t1>
<t2>Lord Henry Wotton, who was lying in the corner of the divan adorned with Iranian saddlebags, smoking countless cigarettes as was his habit, could make out the honey-colored, honey-sweet flowers of the yellow wisteria tree from where he was.</t2> <t3>The tree's trembling branches seemed to struggle under the burden of such flame-like beauty.</t3> <t4>Occasionally, the shadows of birds, like dreams, would fall upon the long, silken curtains stretched in front of the large window.</t4> <t5>At first glance, these curtains, which evoked a Japanese atmosphere, reminded Lord Henry of the pale, emerald-faced painters of Tokyo; painters who tried to convey movement and speed through the necessarily static medium of art.</t5> <t6>The dull hum of bees, either trying to make their way through the tall, uncut grass or circling monotonously around the dusty, gilded horns of the sprawling French marigolds, seemed to make the tranquility of the surroundings all the more tedious.</t6> <t7>The faint hum of London resembled the bass notes of a distant organ melody.</t7>
<t8>In the very center of the room, on a standing canvas, stood a portrait of an extraordinarily beautiful young man.</t8> <t9>In front of it, a little further away, sat the painter of the portrait: Basil Hallward, who had caused quite a stir a few years ago by suddenly disappearing and giving rise to a host of strange speculations.</t9>
<t10>As he gazed at the elegant and handsome figure reflected in the artist's work, a smile of pleasure spread across his face, and it seemed as if he wanted to linger there for a while.</t10> <t11>However, he suddenly started and straightened up, closing his eyes and pressing his fingertips against his eyelids as if trying to trap a strange dream in his mind that he feared losing upon waking.</t11>
<t12>Lord Henry said in a lazy voice, "This is your best work, Basil, the finest thing you have done."</t12> <t13>"You must send it to the Grosvenor Gallery next year, without a doubt.</t13> <t14>The Academy is too large, too vulgar.</t14> <t15>Whenever I went there, I either couldn't see the paintings because of the crowd, which is a terrible thing, or I couldn't see the people because of the multitude of paintings, which is even worse.</t15> <t16>Believe me, the only option is the Grosvenor Gallery.</t16><t17>"</t17>
<t18>The painter replied, "I don't think I'll send this anywhere," throwing his head back with that strange motion that had always amused his friends when he was in Oxford.</t18> <t19>"No, I won't send it anywhere.</t19><t20>"</t20>
<t21>Lord Henry raised his eyebrows; he looked at his friend in astonishment through the thin, blue rings of smoke spiraling up from the thick, opium-laced cigarette he was smoking.</t21>
<t22>“Aren't you going to send it anywhere?</t22> <t23>My dear friend, why?</t23> <t24>Do you have a reason?</t24> <t25>You painters are such strange people!</t25> <t26>You do everything to gain fame.</t26> <t27>And as soon as you gain it, you want to squander it!</t27> <t28>What you're doing is nonsense, because if there's anything worse in this world than being talked about, it's not being talked about.</t28> <t29>Such a portrait would place you higher than all the young painters in England and make the old ones die of envy; though I don't know if the old ones have any feelings left.</t29><t30>”</t30>
<t31>Painter Hallward said, "I know you will mock me, but still, I really can't exhibit this painting."</t31> <t32>"I have put so much of myself into it.</t32><t33>"</t33>
<t34>Lord Henry lay full length on the divan and laughed.</t34>
<t35>"Yes, I knew you would laugh, but I'm still telling the truth, no matter what you say."</t35><t36>"</t36>
<t37>“You added a lot of yourself, huh!</t37> <t38>God bless you, Basil, I never knew you were so arrogant.</t38> <t39>I can't see any resemblance between your coal-black hair, your harsh-lined, swarthy face and this young Adonis; believe me, this young man looks like he's made of ivory and rose petals.</t39> <t40>A perfect Adonis, dear Basil, while you...</t40> <t41>Yes, you do have an intellectual expression, and so on, but beauty, true beauty, ends where the intellectual expression begins.</t41> <t42>The mind is a kind of exaggeration in itself, it disrupts the harmony of the face it enters.</t42> <t43>The moment a person starts to think, they become all nose, all forehead, or something equally dreadful.</t43> <t44>Just look at the men who have succeeded in intellectual professions.</t44> <t45>How utterly ugly they are from head to toe!</t45> <t46>Only the church is an exception to this, naturally.</t46> <t47>However, those who have made the church their profession do not think either.</t47> <t48>A bishop will say at eighty what he was taught to say at eighteen, and as a result, he always appears charming.</t48> <t49>As for that mysterious young friend of yours whose name you haven't mentioned but whose portrait truly fascinates me, I don't think he thinks at all.</t49> <t50>I can bet on it.</t50> <t51>A brainless, beautiful creature; he should be here in winter when we have no flowers to look at, and in summer when we need something to cool our minds.</t51> <t52>Don't flatter yourself, Basil, you don't resemble him in the slightest.</t52><t53>”</t53>
<t54>The painter replied, "You don't understand me, Harry."</t54> <t55>"Of course, I don't resemble him.</t55> <t56>I know this very well.</t56> <t57>In fact, I would be upset if I resembled him.</t57> <t58>Are you shrugging your shoulders?</t58> <t59>I'm telling you the truth.</t59> <t60>In my opinion, there is a curse in all physical and mental excellence, the kind of curse that has followed the faltering steps of kings throughout history.</t60> <t61>It is better not to be different from our other human brothers.</t61> <t62>I think the luckiest ones in this world are the ugly and the foolish.</t62> <t63>They can lie back and watch the game called life with their mouths open.</t63> <t64>Even if they don't know what victory is, at least they don't taste defeat either.</t64> <t65>They actually live as we all should live, carefree, indifferent, and without turmoil.</t65> <t66>They do not cause the ruin of others, nor do they become victims at the hands of others.</t66> <t67>Your title and wealth, Harry; my mind and intellect, however limited; if my art has any value; Dorian Gray's beauty...</t67> <t68>We will all suffer because of these gifts from God, and suffer greatly.</t68><t69>"</t69>
<t70>Lord Henry walked towards Basil Hallward, who was sitting on the other side of the studio, and said, "Dorian Gray?"</t70> <t71>"Is that his name?</t71><t72>"</t72>
<t73>“Yes, that's the name.</t73> <t74>I had no intention of telling you.</t74><t75>”</t75>
<t76>“Why, then?</t76><t77>”</t77>
<t78>“Oh, I can't explain it!</t78> <t79>If I like someone a lot, I never tell anyone their name.</t79> <t80>It feels like handing over a piece of their identity to someone else.</t80> <t81>Over time, I grew to love secrecy.</t81> <t82>It seems to me that this is the only thing that can make modern life appear mysterious and magical to us.</t82> <t83>If you keep it secret, even the most ordinary thing can become sweet and enjoyable.</t83> <t84>These days, when I leave the city, I don't tell anyone where I'm going.</t84> <t85>If I did, all the fun would be ruined.</t85> <t86>It might be a childish habit, but it seems to add a lot of romance to one's life.</t86> <t87>You probably think I'm really stupid because of this, don't you?</t87><t88>”</t88>
<t89>“Not at all,” replied Lord Henry.</t89> <t90>“Dear Basil, not at all.</t90> <t91>You forget that I am a married man; the only attractive aspect of marriage is that it makes a life of deception necessary for both parties.</t91> <t92>I have no idea where my wife is in the world, and my wife has no idea what I am up to.</t92> <t93>When we meet – which we occasionally do, when we are invited to a dinner together or go to see the duke – we tell each other the most ridiculous lies without batting an eye.</t93> <t94>My wife is very skilled at this, much more skilled than I am, to be honest.</t94> <t95>She never gets the dates wrong, whereas I always do.</t95> <t96>But when my wife catches my lie, she never makes a fuss.</t96> <t97>Sometimes I wish she would, but she just laughs it off.</t97><t98>”</t98>
<t99>Basil Hallward walked slowly towards the door leading to the garden and said, "I hate the way you talk about your marriage, Harry."</t99> <t100>"I believe that you are actually a very good husband, but you are ashamed of your own virtues.</t100> <t101>You are a unique fellow, indeed.</t101> <t102>You never say anything moral, nor do you ever do anything immoral.</t102> <t103>Your cynical attitude is nothing but an affectation.</t103><t104>"</t104>
<t105>Lord Henry laughed and said, "Being natural is just another pose, and the most irritating one at that, in my opinion."</t105>
<t106>Two young men went out to the garden together and sat on the long bamboo bench in the shade of a tall laurel tree.</t106> <t107>The sun was sliding down the polished leaves.</t107> <t108>The white daisies among the grass were trembling.</t108>
<t109>After a pause, Lord Henry took out his pocket watch.</t109>
<t110>“I'm sorry, but I have to go, Basil,” he murmured.</t110> <t111>“But before I go, I will insist that you answer one question.</t111> <t112>I asked you some time ago as well.</t112><t113>”</t113>
<t114>Without lifting his eyes from the ground, the painter asked, "What is it?"</t114>
<t115>“You know it very well.</t115><t116>”</t116>
<t117>“I don't know, Harry.</t117><t118>”</t118>
<t119>"Well then, let me tell you.</t119> <t120>I want you to explain why you don't want to exhibit Dorian Gray's portrait.</t120><t121>"</t121>
<t122>“I told you, the real reason.</t122><t123>”</t123>
<t124>“No, you didn't say that.</t124> <t125>You said, I put too much of myself into this painting.</t125> <t126>My friend, this is childhood.</t126><t127>”</t127>
<t128>Looking into his friend's eyes, Basil Hallward said, "Harry."</t128> <t129>"Every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter.</t129> <t130>The sitter is merely the accident, the occasion.</t130> <t131>It is not he who is revealed by the painter; it is rather the painter who, on the colored canvas, reveals himself.</t131> <t132>That is the reason I will not exhibit this picture: I am afraid that I have shown in it the secret of my own soul."</t132><t133></t133>
<t134>Lord Henry laughed.</t134> <t135>“What could this mystery be?” he asked.</t135>
<t136>Hallward said, "I will tell you," but a look of astonishment had appeared on his face.</t136>
<t137>His friend glanced at him and said, "I'm waiting, Basil."</t137>
<t138>The painter replied, "There isn't much to tell."</t138> <t139>"I'm afraid you won't understand it properly.</t139> <t140>Maybe you won't want to believe it.</t140><t141>"</t141>
<t142>Lord Henry smiled and bent down, plucked a pink daisy from the grass, and began to examine it.</t142> <t143>Looking carefully at this small round flower with a golden eye in his hand, he said, "I have no doubt that I will understand."</t143> <t144>"As for believing; I can believe anything, as long as it is something utterly unbelievable.</t144><t145>"</t145>
<t146>The breeze scattered a few sprigs of flowers from the fruit trees; large lilacs, resembling clusters of stars, swayed in the languid air.</t146> <t147>A cricket began to chirp by the wall; a slender, long dragonfly, with its brown gauzy wings, flew past like a blue silk thread.</t147> <t148>Lord Henry felt as if he could hear his friend's heartbeat and wondered what he was going to say.</t148>
<t149>After a pause, the painter said, "It all comes down to this."</t149> <t150>"Two months ago, I attended one of Lady Brandon's gatherings.</t150> <t151>You know, we poor artists occasionally have to show up in high society, just to remind everyone that we are not complete savages.</t151> <t152>Once, you told me; as long as one wears an evening coat and a white tie, anyone, even a stockbroker, can gain a reputation as a civilized person.</t152> <t153>Anyway, I had been in the room for about ten minutes.</t153> <t154>I was chatting with those large, overly adorned, elderly noblewomen and those tedious academy members when suddenly, I felt someone was looking at me.</t154> <t155>When I turned around, I saw Dorian Gray.</t155> <t156>I didn't know him at all.</t156> <t157>When our eyes met, I felt my face turn pale.</t157> <t158>A strange unease enveloped me.</t158> <t159>The mere presence of this person I was facing was so captivating that, if I allowed it, he could take over my entire being, my soul, even my art.</t159> <t160>I realized this immediately.</t160> <t161>Yet, I did not want any external interference in my life.</t161> <t162>You know how independent I am by nature, Harry.</t162> <t163>I have always been my own master.</t163> <t164>That is, until I met Dorian Gray.</t164> <t165>At that moment...</t165> <t166>But I don't know how to explain it to you.</t166> <t167>It was as if a voice was telling me that I was on the brink of a terrible crisis.</t167> <t168>I had a premonition that fate had prepared unparalleled joys and unparalleled sorrows for me.</t168>
<t169>I got scared, turned around, and walked to the door with the intention of going outside. It wasn't the voice of my conscience that made me do this, it was a kind of cowardice.</t169> <t170>I'm not giving myself any credit for trying to escape.</t170><t171>”</t171>
<t172>“Conscience and cowardice are really the same thing, Basil.</t172> <t173>Conscience is just the trade name of the firm, that's all.</t173><t174>”</t174>
<t175>“I don't believe this, Harry; I don't believe you think this way either.</t175> <t176>Anyway, whatever it was that made me act this way...</t176> <t177>maybe it was pride, I used to be very proud once...</t177> <t178>The truth is, I made my way through the crowd towards the door.</t178> <t179>But there, I naturally collided with Lady Brandon.</t179> <t180>Lady Brandon exclaimed, ‘Mr. Hallward, are you running away so early?’</t180> <t181>You know how oddly high-pitched her voice is!</t181><t182>”</t182>
<t183>Lord Henry, plucking the daisy with his long, sensitive fingers, said, "Yes, he is a peacock in everything but beauty."</t183>
<t184>“I couldn't escape from her.</t184> <t185>She introduced me to people of royal lineage, to those with titles and decorations, to hook-nosed individuals with enormous crowns, and to elderly ladies.</t185> <t186>She would refer to me as her very dear friend.</t186> <t187>Although we had only met once before, she was determined to take me under her wing.</t187> <t188>I suppose one of my paintings had gained some fame at that time, or rather, it had been written about in the colorful boulevard newspapers, which is the measure of immortality in the nineteenth century.</t188> <t189>I came face to face with the young man who had stirred such strange emotions within me.</t189> <t190>Our eyes met.</t190> <t191>It was a reckless move, I know, but I asked Lady Brandon to introduce us.</t191> <t192>Perhaps it wasn't recklessness, who knows.</t192> <t193>Maybe it was inevitable.</t193> <t194>Even if we hadn't been introduced, we would have spoken to each other.</t194> <t195>I'm sure of it.</t195> <t196>Later, Dorian said the same thing.</t196> <t197>He also felt that it was written in our fate to know each other.</t197><t198>”</t198>
<t199>Lord Henry asked, "Well, how did Lady Brandon describe this wonderful young man?"</t199> <t200>"I know she is excellent at giving quick summaries of all her guests.</t200> <t201>I remember once she took me to a red-faced, grumpy old man covered in medals and ribbons; then she leaned over and began to whisper tragic details into my ear, which I'm sure everyone there could clearly hear.</t201> <t202>Lady Brandon treats her guests the way auctioneers view the items they sell.</t202> <t203>She either dismisses them with a single remark or reveals everything about them, except what one actually wants to know.</t203><t204>"</t204>
<t205>The painter spoke with a bit of boredom, "Poor Lady Brandon! You are not showing her any mercy, Harry!"</t205>
<t206>“My dear friend, this woman attempted to establish a salon but only managed to set up a restaurant.</t206> <t207>How can I admire her?</t207> <t208>But you tell me, what did she say about Mr. Dorian Gray?</t208><t209>”</t209>
<t210>“He mumbled something like: a lovely child...</t210> <t211>We were inseparable with his poor mother.</t211> <t212>I can't remember what Dorian was doing...</t212> <t213>I'm afraid he's doing nothing...</t213> <t214>Ah, yes, he plays the piano, doesn't he...</t214> <t215>Or was it the violin, dear Mr. Gray?..</t215> <t216>We both couldn't help but laugh, and we immediately hit it off.</t216><t217>”</t217>
<t218>The Young Lord plucked another daisy and said, "Laughter is not a bad start for friendship; it is the best way to end it."</t218>
<t219>Hallward shook his head, "Harry, you don't understand what friendship means," he said.</t219> <t220>"Nor do you know the meaning of enmity.</t220> <t221>You love everyone, which means you are indifferent to everyone.</t221><t222>"</t222>
<t223>Lord Henry, "What a terrible injustice you do to me!" he said, pushing his hat back; he looked at the clouds flying like unraveled bright silk skeins over the turquoise dome of the summer sky.</t223> <t224>"Yes, you do me a terrible injustice.</t224> <t225>In fact, I do distinguish between people.</t225> <t226>I choose my friends for their beauty, my acquaintances for the solidity of their character, and my enemies for their sharp intellect.</t226> <t227>One cannot be too careful in choosing one's enemies.</t227> <t228>I do not have a single foolish enemy.</t228> <t229>All my enemies have strong mental faculties, and therefore they appreciate my worth.</t229> <t230>Do you find me very arrogant?</t230> <t231>Yes, I am quite arrogant.</t231><t232>"</t232>
<t233>“I think so too, Harry.</t233> <t234>But according to your classification, I am merely an acquaintance in your eyes.</t234><t235>”</t235>
<t236>“My very dear friend Basil, you are much more than an acquaintance.</t236><t237>”</t237>
<t238>“But far from being just a friend.</t238> <t239>Am I a kind of sibling, I wonder?</t239><t240>”</t240>
<t241>“Oh, don't call me brother!</t241> <t242>I don't like that word at all.</t242> <t243>My older brother doesn't seem to know how to die; and my younger siblings don't seem to know anything but dying.</t243><t244>”</t244>
<t245>Basil Hallward frowned and said, "Harry!"</t245>
<t246>“My friend, I'm joking.</t246> <t247>Still, I can't help but hate my relatives.</t247> <t248>It's probably because none of us can stand seeing our own flaws in others.</t248> <t249>I understand very well the British democracy's grudge against what they call the bad traits of the upper classes.</t249> <t250>The masses want drunkenness, stupidity, and immorality to be exclusive to them!</t250> <t251>When one of us disgraces themselves, it's as if their private property has been violated: The public's outrage was truly remarkable when poor little Southwark found himself in the divorce court.</t251> <t252>Yet, I don't think even one-tenth of the proletariat lives a flawless life.</t252><t253>”</t253>
<t254>“Harry, I don't believe a single word you're saying.</t254> <t255>Moreover, I'm sure you don't believe it either.</t255><t256>”</t256>
<t257>Lord Henry was stroking his sharp, chestnut-colored beard and kept tapping his patent leather shoes with his tasseled ebony cane.</t257>
<t258>“How typically English you are, Basil! You are stating the same opinion for the second time.</t258> <t259>When a person presents an idea to a true Englishman...</t259> <t260>Which is already a dangerous task...</t260> <t261>He never even considers whether the idea is right or wrong.</t261> <t262>The only thing he deems important is whether he himself believes in it.</t262> <t263>Now, there is no connection between the value of an idea and the sincerity of the person presenting it.</t263> <t264>To be honest, most likely, the less sincere a person is, the purer the intellectual value of the idea will be, because it will not be tainted by that person's needs, desires, and prejudices.</t264> <t265>However, I have no intention of discussing politics, sociology, or metaphysics with you.</t265> <t266>I love people more than principles.</t266> <t267>Tell me a bit more about this Mr. Dorian Gray.</t267> <t268>Do you see him often?</t268><t269>”</t269>
<t270>“Every day.</t270> <t271>If I don't see him every day, I can't be happy!</t271> <t272>I can't do without him anymore.</t272><t273>”</t273>
<t274>“An unusual thing, indeed!</t274> <t275>I thought you didn't care about anything other than art.</t275><t276>”</t276>
<t277>The painter replied seriously, "For me, my art means everything now."</t277> <t278>"Harry, sometimes I think there are only two periods in world history that can be considered important, in my opinion.</t278> <t279>The first is the emergence of a new art environment, and the second is the appearance of a new personality for art.</t279> <t280>The invention of oil painting was to the Venetian painters what the face of Antinous was to the late Greek sculptors, and one day, Dorian Gray's face will hold that importance for me.</t280> <t281>I'm not just drawing and painting because of him.</t281> <t282>Of course, I am doing those things.</t282> <t283>Yet, in my eyes, he means much more than just a model.</t283> <t284>I'm not going to tell you that I'm not satisfied with the paintings I made inspired by him, or that art cannot capture his beauty.</t284> <t285>There is nothing that art cannot express; I know that the works I've done since I met Dorian Gray are good products, the best I've ever produced.</t285> <t286>Still, how strange...</t286> <t287>I wonder if you'll understand me?..</t287> <t288>Thanks to his personality, I feel as if there's a completely new style in art.</t288> <t289>A completely new style.</t289> <t290>I see everything differently, I perceive everything differently now.</t290> <t291>Nowadays, I can create life in a completely new form that I didn't know or see before.</t291> <t292>'A form dreamt of in the days of thought.'</t292> <t293>Who said that?</t293> <t294>I can't remember, but that's what Dorian Gray is to me.</t294> <t295>The mere visible presence of this boy...</t295> <t296>Actually, he's over twenty, but I always see him as a child...</t296> <t297>Yes, even his mere visible presence...</t297> <t298>Oh, I don't know if you can grasp the full meaning of all this?</t298> <t299>Without even knowing it, this boy seems to define the lines of a completely new art school: a school that will combine all the fire of the romantic school with all the perfection of the ancient Greek school.</t299> <t300>The harmony of body and soul...</t300> <t301>How important this is!</t301> <t302>We, in our stupidity, have separated them, invented a crude realism, an empty idealism.</t302> <t303>Oh, Harry, if only you could understand what Dorian Gray symbolizes to me!</t303> <t304>You know that landscape of mine, Agnew offered a fortune for it, but I didn't let it go.</t304> <t305>It's one of my best works.</t305> <t306>And why, do you think?</t306> <t307>Because while I was painting it, Dorian Gray was sitting beside me.</t307> <t308>There must have been an intangible influence from him to me, because for the first time in my life, I found the magic I had always sought but never caught in the ordinary forest in front of me.</t308><t309>"</t309>
<t310>"Basil, this is unheard of!</t310> <t311>I absolutely must see Dorian Gray.</t311><t312>"</t312>
<t313>Hallward stood up and began pacing back and forth in the garden.</t313> <t314>A little later, he came back again.</t314> <t315>“Harry,” he said.</t315> <t316>“Dorian Gray is merely a motive that drives me to creativity.</t316> <t317>I find everything in him.</t317> <t318>You may find nothing.</t318> <t319>The times when he is most present in my works are also the times when his image is not seen.</t319> <t320>As I said, he is the intuition of a completely new style.</t320> <t321>I find him in the curve of some lines, in the beauty of certain colors, in their indescribable delicacy.</t321> <t322>That's all.</t322><t323>”</t323>
<t324>Lord Henry asked, "Then why don't you exhibit his portrait?"</t324>
<t325>“It is because I have unconsciously reflected in that portrait the strange artistic idolatry I have heard of.</t325> <t326>I never spoke to him about these feelings, naturally.</t326> <t327>Dorian Gray has no idea about it.</t327> <t328>Nor will he ever.</t328> <t329>However, others might sense it; and I have no intention of exposing my soul to their shallow, curious eyes.</t329> <t330>I will never lay my heart under their microscopes.</t330> <t331>There is too much of myself in the portrait, Harry, far too much!</t331><t332>”</t332>
<t333>“Poets do not split hairs as much as you do.</t333> <t334>They know that passion is something useful to publish.</t334> <t335>Nowadays, a burning heart can make countless impressions.</t335><t336>”</t336>
<t337>The painter shouted, "I despise them for this very reason!"</t337> <t338>"An artist should create beautiful things, but should not put anything of his own life into them.</t338> <t339>We live in an age where everyone looks at art as a kind of autobiography.</t339> <t340>We have lost the sense of abstract beauty.</t340> <t341>One day I will show the world what it is; that is why the world will never see my portrait of Dorian Gray.</t341><t342>"</t342>
<t343>“I think your attitude is wrong, Basil, but I'm not going to argue with you.</t343> <t344>If you ask me, those who go astray intellectually argue incessantly.</t344> <t345>Tell me, is Dorian Gray very attached to you?</t345><t346>”</t346>
<t347>The painter thought for a while.</t347> <t348>After a pause, he replied, "She likes me."</t348> <t349>"I know, she likes me.</t349> <t350>Of course, I also flatter her immensely.</t350> <t351>I take a strange pleasure in telling her a lot of things that I know I will definitely regret later.</t351> <t352>She generally behaves very sweetly and charmingly towards me.</t352> <t353>We sit in the studio and talk about a thousand different topics.</t353> <t354>However, sometimes she acts incredibly thoughtlessly, as if she takes real pleasure in causing me pain.</t354> <t355>Harry, at those times, it feels to me as if I have given my entire soul to someone who treats it like a flower to be pinned to their lapel; she treats my soul like an ornament to flatter her vanity, an ornament to be used and discarded on a summer day.</t355><t356>"</t356>
<t357>Lord Henry murmured, “Summer days are long, Basil.”</t357><t358>“Perhaps you will tire of it before it does.</t358><t359>A sad thought, yes, but genius undoubtedly lasts longer than beauty.</t359><t360>That is why we all go to such lengths to educate ourselves excessively.</t360><t361>In this mad, fierce struggle for life, we all want to possess something durable, so we fill our heads with trivia, with facts, to maintain our place in the struggle.</t361><t362>The man with complete knowledge: This is the contemporary ideal.</t362><t363>Yet the mind of a man with complete knowledge is a terrifying thing.</t363><t364>Like a shop selling second-hand crockery, full of dust and misshapen objects, monsters.</t364><t365>Everything is priced above its real value.</t365><t366>Yes, it seems to me that you will be the first to grow weary.</t366><t367>One day you will look at your friend, and his features will seem somewhat out of proportion to you, or you will not like the tone of his color, or something like that.</t367><t368>Inwardly, you will bitterly reproach him, thinking he has treated you very badly.</t368><t369>When he comes to your door again, you will behave entirely coldly and indifferently towards him.</t369><t370>It will be a great pity, really, because it will change you.</t370><t371>The story you told me is a thoroughly romantic one, a romance of art, we might say.</t371><t372>The worst part of living such a romantic story is that when it ends, it completely alienates a person from romanticism.</t372><t373>”</t373>
<t374>"Harry, don't talk like that.</t374> <t375>As long as I exist, the influence of Dorian Gray will dominate me.</t375> <t376>You can't feel what I feel!</t376> <t377>You are someone who is constantly changing.</t377><t378>"</t378>
<t379>“Ah, dear Basil, that is precisely why I can feel these things.</t379> <t380>Those who are faithful in love only know the trivial aspects of love; those who know its tragedies are unfaithful.” Lord Henry began to puff on his cigarette, which he had lit with an elegant silver lighter, with a self-aware and self-satisfied air; you would think he had summarized the world in a single sentence.</t380> <t381>There was the rustling of sparrows chirping among the polished leaves of the ivy, and blue cloud shadows were flying over the grass like swallows.</t381> <t382>How beautiful it was to be in this garden!</t382> <t383>How delightful were the feelings of others!</t383> <t384>Lord Henry found people's feelings much more delightful than their thoughts.</t384> <t385>One's own soul and the feelings of friends: these were the matters that enveloped a person in life.</t385> <t386>Lord Henry thought with a secret smile about the tedious dinner invitation he had avoided by lingering so long beside Basil Hallward.</t386> <t387>If he had gone to his aunt's invitation, he would have undoubtedly encountered Lord Goodbody, and the entire conversation would have been about the necessity of feeding the poor and building model housing.</t387> <t388>Every class would be prattling about the importance of virtues that were not a necessity for their own lives.</t388> <t389>The rich would extol the value of thrift, and the lazy would praise the nobility of labor to the skies.</t389> <t390>It had been so sweet to escape from these!</t390> <t391>As Lord Henry thought of his aunt, something seemed to occur to him.</t391> <t392>Turning to the painter, he said, “It just came to my mind.”</t392>
<t393>“What comes to your mind, Harry?”</t393><t394></t394>
<t395>"Where I might have heard the name Dorian Gray."</t395><t396>"</t396>
<t397>Hallward, faintly wrinkling his face, asked, "Where?"</t397>
<t398>"Basil, don't get so angry.</t398> <t399>I had heard it from my aunt Lady Agatha.</t399> <t400>My aunt told me that she had discovered a wonderful young man, that this young man would help her in the East End, and that his name was Dorian Gray.</t400> <t401>I must also point out that my aunt never mentioned that this boy was handsome.</t401> <t402>Women don't understand beauty anyway, or rather, respectable women don't.</t402> <t403>My aunt told me that this young man was very serious, honest, and well-mannered.</t403> <t404>In my mind, I immediately pictured someone with greasy hair, glasses, and terrible freckles, wandering around with huge feet.</t404> <t405>I wish I had known that this young man was the person you were talking about.</t405><t406>"</t406>
<t407>"I'm very glad you didn't know, Harry.</t407><t408>"</t408>
<t409>“Why?</t409><t410>”</t410>
<t411>“That's because I don't want you to know him.</t411><t412>”</t412>
<t413>"You don't want me to know him, huh?"</t413><t414>"</t414>
<t415>"I don't want to."</t415><t416>"</t416>
<t417>"Mr. Dorian Gray is in the studio, sir."</t417> <t418>The male servant had appeared in the garden.</t418>
<t419>Lord Henry laughed, "Now you have to introduce me!" he said.</t419>
<t420>The painter looked at his servant who was standing in the sun, blinking his eyes.</t420> <t421>“Parker, please tell Mr. Gray to wait.</t421> <t422>I am coming in a few minutes.</t422><t423>”</t423>
<t424>Adam bent down, then walked towards the house.</t424>
<t425>Then the painter looked at Lord Henry.</t425> <t426>"Dorian Gray is my most precious friend," he said.</t426> <t427>"He has a simple, beautiful personality.</t427> <t428>Your aunt has described him very accurately.</t428> <t429>Do not spoil his purity.</t429> <t430>Do not try to influence him.</t430> <t431>Your influence will be bad.</t431> <t432>The world is vast.</t432> <t433>There are many wonderful people in it.</t433> <t434>Do not take away the only person who adds a touch of charm to my art, Harry.</t434> <t435>My life as an artist depends on Dorian Gray.</t435> <t436>Remember, I trust you, Harry."</t436> <t437>He spoke slowly; it was as if a force beyond his will was pulling the words out of him.</t437>
<t438>Lord Henry smiled and said, "What nonsense are you talking about!" and, grabbing Basil Hallward by the arm, dragged him into the house.</t438>
<t439>Second chapter</t439>
<t440>They saw Dorian Gray as they entered.</t440> <t441>The young man was sitting at the piano with his back turned, leafing through the pages of Schumann's Forest Scenes.</t441>
<t442>“Basil, lend these to me!” he called out.</t442> <t443>“I want to learn.</t443> <t444>They are very exquisite things.</t444><t445>”</t445>
<t446>"Everything depends on the modeling you will do for me today, Dorian.</t446><t447>"</t447>
<t448>The young man, "Ugh, I'm tired of modeling, I don't want any full-length portraits either," he said grumpily, with a stubborn expression, turning to those who had come while sitting on the piano stool.</t448> <t449>When he saw Lord Henry, a slight color spread across his cheeks for a moment as he stood up.</t449> <t450>"I'm sorry, Basil, I didn't know you had someone with you.</t450><t451>"</t451>
<t452>“Dorian, this is Lord Henry Wotton, an old friend of mine from Oxford.</t452> <t453>I was just telling him what an exceptional model you are, and you ruined everything.</t453><t454>”</t454>
<t455>“You did not spoil the pleasure I felt in meeting you at all, Mr. Gray,” said Lord Henry, stepping forward and extending his hand.</t455> <t456>“My aunt spoke to me about you.</t456> <t457>You are one of her favorites.</t457> <t458>I fear you are one of her victims.</t458><t459>”</t459>
<t460>Dorian said with a ridiculous expression of regret, "At the moment, I am on Lady Agatha's blacklist."</t460> <t461>"I promised to go with her to a club in Whitechapel last Tuesday, but I completely forgot.</t461> <t462>We were supposed to play a duet together, three duets, if I'm not mistaken.</t462> <t463>Who knows what she will say to me!</t463> <t464>I am too afraid to go.</t464><t465>"</t465>
<t466>“I will mediate between you.</t466> <t467>My aunt likes you very much.</t467> <t468>I don't think your not going to the club would have changed anything.</t468> <t469>Those present there probably thought it was a duet anyway.</t469> <t470>When my Aunt Agatha sits at the piano, she makes a racket for two.</t470><t471>”</t471>
<t472>Dorian laughed, "That's an insult to your aunt, and not much of a compliment to me," he said.</t472>
<t473>Lord Henry looked at him.</t473> <t474>Yes, this boy was indeed extraordinarily handsome, with his delicately curved bright red lips, open-hearted blue eyes, and vibrant golden hair.</t474> <t475>There was something in his face that immediately won one's trust.</t475> <t476>Alongside the passionate innocence of youth, there was also an openness in this countenance.</t476> <t477>It seemed as if he could protect himself from the world's corruption.</t477> <t478>It was no wonder Basil Hallward adored him.</t478> <t479>"You are too charming to devote yourself to charity, Mr. Gray, far too charming for such things." Saying this, Lord Henry threw himself onto the sofa and opened the cigarette case.</t479>
<t480>The painter, in the meantime, was mixing his paints and preparing his brushes.</t480> <t481>His face was anxious, especially after hearing these last words, he glanced towards Henry, hesitated for a moment, then said, "Harry, I want to finish this painting today."</t481> <t482>"Would it be too rude if I asked you to leave?</t482><t483>"</t483>
<t484>Lord Henry smiled as he looked at Dorian Gray.</t484> <t485>"Do I have to go, Mr. Gray?" he asked.</t485>
<t486>“Ah, my dear, don't go, Lord Henry.</t486> <t487>I can see it, Basil is in a bad mood; I can't stand him when he sulks.</t487> <t488>Besides, I want you to tell me why I shouldn't be interested in charitable works?</t488><t489>”</t489>
<t490>“I don't really think I will tell you this, Mr. Gray.</t490> <t491>Charity work is such a boring subject that it forces one to become serious.</t491> <t492>On the other hand, I won't run away, since you want me to stay.</t492> <t493>Basil, you aren't really angry with me, are you?</t493> <t494>You've said many times that your models like having someone to chat with beside them.</t494><t495>”</t495>
<t496>Hallward bit his lip, "If Dorian wants it, of course you will stay.</t496> <t497>Dorian's whims are considered law for everyone except himself.</t497><t498>"</t498>
<t499>Lord Henry took his hat and gloves in his hand.</t499> <t500>“You insist too much, but unfortunately, I have to go, Basil.</t500> <t501>I have an appointment with someone in Orleans.</t501> <t502>Goodbye, Mr. Gray.</t502> <t503>Come to Curzon Street one afternoon so we can meet.</t503> <t504>I am usually home at five in the evening almost every day.</t504> <t505>Write to me the day you will come.</t505> <t506>I would like to see you when you arrive.</t506><t507>”</t507>
<t508>Dorian Gray said, "Basil!"</t508> <t509>"If Lord Henry Wotton leaves, I will leave too.</t509> <t510>You don't open your mouth while you draw; standing on the platform trying to look cheerful is driving me crazy.</t510> <t511>Ask him to stay.</t511> <t512>What I say goes.</t512><t513>"</t513>
<t514>Hallward, with his eyes fixed intently on the picture he was drawing, said, "Stay, Harry, stay and cheer up Dorian, and make me happy too."</t514> <t515>"It's very true, I never talk while I'm working, nor do I listen to what's being said.</t515> <t516>It must be terribly boring for my poor models.</t516> <t517>I beg you to stay.</t517><t518>"</t518>
<t519>“So, what will happen to the man in Orleans?</t519><t520>”</t520>
<t521>The painter laughed.</t521> <t522>"I don't think this will cause any trouble.</t522> <t523>Sit down, Harry.</t523> <t524>And you, Dorian, get up on that platform.</t524> <t525>Try not to move too much; and don't pay attention to what Lord Henry says.</t525> <t526>He has a very bad influence on all his friends except me.</t526><t527>"</t527>
<t528>Dorian Gray stepped onto the platform with the air of a young saint from ancient Greece, looking towards Lord Henry and slightly wrinkling his face with a hint of complaint.</t528> <t529>He had taken quite a liking to Lord Henry.</t529> <t530>This man was so different from Basil.</t530> <t531>The two friends formed a very delightful contrast.</t531> <t532>Lord Henry's voice was also beautiful.</t532> <t533>A few minutes later, Dorian asked him: “Do you really have such a bad influence on your friends, Lord Henry?</t533> <t534>Is it as bad as Basil says?</t534><t535>”</t535>
<t536>“There is no such thing as a good influence, Mr. Gray.</t536> <t537>All influence is immoral – immoral from the scientific point of view.</t537><t538>”</t538>
<t539>“Why?</t539><t540>”</t540>
<t541>“To influence someone means to give them your own soul.</t541> <t542>This person no longer thinks with their own natural thoughts, no longer burns with their own natural passions.</t542> <t543>Their virtues are not genuine.</t543> <t544>Their sins – if there is such a thing as sin – are borrowed.</t544> <t545>This person becomes a reflection of someone else's music, an actor playing a role not written for them.</t545> <t546>The purpose of life is for a person to develop themselves.</t546> <t547>To perfectly realize the requirements of our nature: That is why each of us is here.</t547> <t548>Yet nowadays people are afraid of their own true selves.</t548> <t549>They have forgotten the highest duty, which is the duty to one's own true self.</t549> <t550>There is nothing to say against their charity.</t550> <t551>They feed the hungry, clothe the beggars.</t551> <t552>But their own souls are hungry, naked.</t552> <t553>There is no courage left in our kind.</t553> <t554>Perhaps there never was.</t554> <t555>Fear of society – which is the basis of morality – and fear of God, which is the secret of religion: These are the two things that govern us.</t555> <t556>On the other hand, still...</t556><t557>”</t557>
<t558>The painter said, "Dorian, turn your head a little more to the right, please."</t558> <t559>He was deeply engrossed in his work, yet he noticed that an expression he had never seen before appeared on the young man's face.</t559>
<t560>Lord Henry continued speaking with that low, melodious voice of his, and with the graceful gesture of his hand that had been characteristic of him since his school days at Eton, "I believe that if a man were to live his life fully and completely, give form to every feeling, express every thought, and realize every dream...</t560> <t561>I think our world would be so refreshed with joy that mankind would forget all the maladies inherited from the Middle Ages and return to the Hellenistic ideal...</t561> <t562>Perhaps to something even nobler and more splendid than the Hellenistic ideal.</t562> <t563>However, even the bravest of us are afraid of ourselves.</t563> <t564>The cutting away of the wild part of us turns into a tragic life struggle with self-denial that casts a shadow over our lives.</t564> <t565>Every impulse we try to strangle broods in the mind and poisons us.</t565> <t566>The body sins once, and the relationship with sin is severed, for action is a form of purification.</t566> <t567>After the action, all that remains is the memory of a pleasure or the luxury of a regret.</t567> <t568>The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it.</t568> <t569>If resisted, the soul grows sick with longing for the things it has forbidden to itself, with desire for what its monstrous laws have made monstrous and unlawful.</t569> <t570>There are those who say that the great events of the world take place in the brain.</t570> <t571>The great sins of the world also take place in the brain, only in the brain.</t571> <t572>You, Mr. Gray, with your rose-red youth and rose-white boyhood, you have had passionate feelings that made you afraid of yourself, thoughts that filled you with terror, dreams that you have seen at night or daydreamed about that merely recalling them might make your face blush with shame...</t572><t573>"</t573>
<t574>“Enough!” said Dorian Gray in a trembling voice.</t574> <t575>“Be quiet! You are confusing me.</t575> <t576>I don't know what to say.</t576> <t577>There is an answer to give you, but I can't find it.</t577> <t578>Don't speak.</t578> <t579>Let me think.</t579> <t580>Or rather, let me try not to think.</t580><t581>”</t581>
<t582>He stood there almost motionless for about ten minutes, his lips parted, a strange brightness in his eyes.</t582> <t583>He vaguely sensed the brand-new stirrings within him, yet they seemed to have come from within himself.</t583> <t584>The few words Basil's friend had spoken –words said at random, undoubtedly filled with deliberate contradictions– had touched a hidden chord within the young man.</t584> <t585>Dorian now felt this chord, which had remained untouched until now, vibrating with a strange pulse.</t585>
<t586>Music also excited him like this.</t586> <t587>There were many times when music made him uneasy.</t587> <t588>However, music does not speak with words.</t588> <t589>What it creates within us is not a new world but a new chaos.</t589> <t590>Words! Simple, ordinary words!</t590> <t591>How terrifying they were!</t591> <t592>How clear, vivid, and ruthless!</t592> <t593>One could not escape from them.</t593> <t594>Yet how intangible their magic was!</t594> <t595>They seemed to have the ability to give a flexible form to immaterial things, as if they had their own music, sweet like a viola, like a flute.</t595> <t596>Everyday words, ha! Was there anything more real than words?</t596>
<t597>Yes; there had been things in his youth that he did not understand.</t597> <t598>Dorian understood them now.</t598> <t599>Life had suddenly turned fiery red in his eyes.</t599> <t600>It was as if he had walked through flames.</t600> <t601>Why hadn't he known this before?</t601>
<t602>Lord Henry was scrutinizing the young man with that meaningful smile.</t602> <t603>He knew well that psychological moment when nothing should be said.</t603> <t604>He felt a deep interest.</t604> <t605>The sudden effect of his words had surprised him, bringing to mind a book he had read when he was six years old, a book that explained many things he hadn't known before.</t605> <t606>He wondered if Dorian Gray was going through a similar experience.</t606> <t607>What he had done was nothing more than shooting an arrow into the air.</t607> <t608>Had the arrow hit the target?</t608> <t609>How fascinating this boy was!</t609>
<t610>Hallward was working with those magnificent, bold strokes of his brush.</t610> <t611>These brush strokes – at least in art – possessed that true maturity and perfect subtlety that only comes from strength.</t611> <t612>The painter had not noticed the silence that had settled over the room.</t612>
<t613>Dorian Gray suddenly complained, "Basil, I'm tired of standing!"</t613> <t614>"I want to go and sit in the garden.</t614> <t615>The air here is suffocating.</t615><t616>"</t616>
<t617>“My dear child, I am very sorry.</t617> <t618>When I am painting, I can't think of anything else.</t618> <t619>But you have never posed so beautifully for me.</t619> <t620>You stood completely still.</t620> <t621>I captured exactly the expression I wanted: glowing eyes with slightly parted lips.</t621> <t622>I don't know what Harry told you, but he certainly managed to give your face a wonderful expression.</t622> <t623>He must have paid you compliments.</t623> <t624>Don't believe a word he says.</t624><t625>”</t625>
<t626>“He never complimented me.</t626> <t627>Maybe that's why I don't believe any of his words.</t627><t628>”</t628>
<t629>Lord Henry looked at the young man with dreamy, wistful eyes and said, "I know full well that you believe in all of it."</t629> <t630>"I'm coming to the garden with you too.</t630> <t631>The studio is terribly hot.</t631> <t632>Basil, let's have something iced, with strawberries."</t632><t633></t633>
<t634>“Hey hey, Harry; pull that bell, I'll tell Parker what you want when he comes.</t634> <t635>I need to finish working on this background, I'll join you later.</t635> <t636>Don't keep Dorian too long.</t636> <t637>I've never been in such good form for painting as I am today.</t637> <t638>This will be my masterpiece.</t638> <t639>Even in its current state, it's my masterpiece.</t639><t640>”</t640>
<t641>When Lord Henry stepped into the garden, he found Dorian Gray with his face buried in the lush, cool lilac flowers, drinking in their scent as if it were wine.</t641> <t642>He approached and placed his hand on the young man's shoulder.</t642>
<t643>“You are doing very right,” he murmured.</t643> <t644>“Only the senses can take the pain of the soul, just as the only thing that can take the pain of the senses is the soul.</t644><t645>”</t645>
<t646>The young man recoiled in shock.</t646> <t647>His head was bare, the leaves of the tree had tousled his curls and tangled his golden hair strands.</t647> <t648>There was a fearful look in his eyes, like the eyes of someone suddenly awakened from sleep.</t648> <t649>His thin, well-defined nostrils were twitching, as if a hidden nerve had drained the color from his lips and made them tremble.</t649>
<t650>Lord Henry continued his speech, "Yes," he said.</t650> <t651>"It is one of the great mysteries of life: to cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means of the soul.</t651> <t652>You are a wonderful creation.</t652> <t653>You know more than you think you do; on the other hand, you know less than you want to know.</t653><t654>"</t654>
<t655>Dorian Gray slightly frowned and turned his head to the other side.</t655> <t656>He couldn't help but dislike this tall, elegant young man standing next to him.</t656> <t657>The romantic dark face and worn expression of this man intrigued him.</t657> <t658>There was something utterly mesmerizing in Lord Henry's low, sleepy voice.</t658> <t659>Even those cool, white, flower-like hands had a strange charm.</t659> <t660>As the man spoke, these hands, moving like music, seemed to have a language of their own.</t660> <t661>Yet Dorian was afraid of him, and he was ashamed of his fear.</t661> <t662>How had a stranger analyzed him so thoroughly?</t662> <t663>He had known Basil Hallward for months, but their friendship had not changed Dorian.</t663> <t664>Then suddenly, someone who had entered his life had seemingly revealed the secret of life to him.</t664> <t665>What was there to be afraid of?</t665> <t666>He was neither a schoolboy nor a young girl.</t666> <t667>Fear was a ridiculous thing.</t667>
<t668>Lord Henry said, "Come on, let's sit in the shade."</t668> <t669>"Parker has brought our drinks.</t669> <t670>If you stay in this sun any longer, your beauty will fade, and Basil will never paint your picture again.</t670> <t671>Indeed, you must be very careful not to get sunburned.</t671> <t672>It wouldn't suit you at all.</t672><t673>"</t673>
<t674>Dorian Gray, laughing, sat on the bench at the end of the garden and said, "What does it matter?"</t674>
<t675>“Everything is of utmost importance to you, Mr. Gray.</t675><t676>”</t676>
<t677>"Why?</t677><t678>"</t678>
<t679>“Because you are wonderfully young.</t679> <t680>The only thing worth holding onto in this world is youth.</t680><t681>”</t681>
<t682>"It doesn't feel that way to me at all, Lord Henry.</t682><t683>"</t683>
<t684>“No, it won't seem like that now.</t684> <t685>But one day it will, when you are old and wrinkled, when you have become ugly; when thoughts have left marks on your forehead, when the terrible fire of lust has stamped your lips, it will seem like that to you too, and it will be bitter.</t685> <t686>Now, wherever you go, you win everyone's heart.</t686> <t687>Will it always be like this?..</t687> <t688>You have an extraordinarily beautiful face, Mr. Gray.</t688> <t689>Don't frown.</t689> <t690>I'm telling the truth.</t690> <t691>Beauty is a kind of genius, even higher than genius because it needs no explanation.</t691> <t692>Beauty is one of the great facts of the world, like sunlight, like springtime, like the reflection of that silver shell we call the moon in dark waters.</t692> <t693>Its greatness cannot be questioned.</t693> <t694>Sovereignty is its divine right.</t694> <t695>It bestows princeliness on those who possess it.</t695> <t696>You're smiling, huh?</t696> <t697>Well, you won't be smiling when you lose your beauty.</t697> <t698>Sometimes people say that beauty is superficial.</t698> <t699>But at least beauty is not as superficial as thought.</t699> <t700>In my eyes, beauty is the miracle of miracles.</t700> <t701>Those who do not judge by appearances are only shallow people.</t701> <t702>The true mystery of the world is the visible, not the invisible...</t702> <t703>Yes, Mr. Gray, the gods have been generous to you.</t703> <t704>But the gods take back what they give very quickly.</t704> <t705>Truly, you have only a few years to live fully and perfectly.</t705> <t706>When your youth goes, your beauty will go too, and then you will suddenly see that there are no more victories to be won.</t706> <t707>Or you will have to be content with some petty victories, which the memories of the past will make more bitter than defeat for you.</t707> <t708>Every month that nears its end wages war against your roses and lilies out of envy.</t708> <t709>In time, you will become sallow, hollow-cheeked, and dull-eyed.</t709> <t710>You will suffer terribly...</t710> <t711>Ah, value your youth while you have it!</t711> <t712>Don't waste the gold of your days listening to tedious people, trying to improve the worthless; don't squander your life on the ignorant, the common, and the vulgar.</t712> <t713>Live! Live the wonderful life that is in you!</t713> <t714>Let nothing be lost.</t714> <t715>Seek new sensations always.</t715> <t716>Fear nothing...</t716> <t717>A new hedonism: that is what our century needs.</t717> <t718>You could be its visible symbol.</t718> <t719>There is nothing you cannot do with your presence.</t719> <t720>The world is yours for a season...</t720> <t721>When I first saw you, I realized that you were unaware of what you really are, of what you could really be.</t721> <t722>There were so many things in you that won my heart that I felt the need to tell you something about yourself.</t722> <t723>How tragic it would be if you were wasted, I thought.</t723> <t724>Your youth will last so short, so short.</t724> <t725>The simplest wildflowers wither, but then they bloom again.</t725> <t726>This laburnum will be just as yellow next June as it is now.</t726> <t727>In a month, purple stars will bloom on these clematis branches, and every year, God's green night will harbor purple stars in its leaves.</t727> <t728>But our youth will never come back again.</t728> <t729>The joy that pulses in our veins at twenty will fade over time.</t729> <t730>Our legs will fail, our senses will decay.</t730> <t731>We will turn into hideous puppets.</t731> <t732>The memory of the passions we were afraid to indulge, the exquisite sins we dared not taste, will haunt us and make us suffer.</t732> <t733>Ah, youth! Youth! There is nothing in the world but youth!</t733><t734>”</t734>
<t735>Dorian opened his eyes, listening in a dazed and bewildered manner.</t735> <t736>The lilac in his hand fell onto the pebbles on the ground.</t736> <t737>A fuzzy bee came and buzzed over the lilac for a moment.</t737> <t738>Then it climbed onto the tuft of star-shaped tiny flowers.</t738> <t739>Dorian watched the bee with that strange interest we try to feel towards insignificant things when important things frighten us, when a brand-new feeling we cannot name stirs within us, or when a thought that terrifies us suddenly besieges our mind and calls for our surrender.</t739> <t740>He saw the bee burrow into the bright-colored trumpet of a purple laughing flower.</t740> <t741>The flower seemed to shiver slightly, then began to gently sway back and forth.</t741>
<t742>Suddenly, the painter appeared at the studio door and waved them inside.</t742> <t743>Dorian and Lord Henry looked at each other and smiled.</t743>
<t744>The painter called out, "I'm waiting."</t744> <t745>"My dear, come on.</t745> <t746>The light is perfect right now.</t746> <t747>Bring your drinks too.</t747><t748>"</t748>
<t749>They stood up and started walking side by side on the road.</t749> <t750>Two butterflies, green and white, fluttered past them; a bird began to sing in the pear tree at the corner of the garden.</t750>
<t751>Lord Henry looked at the young man and said, "You are glad to have met me, Mr. Gray."</t751>
<t752>“Yes, now I am happy.</t752> <t753>Will I always be this happy, I wonder?</t753><t754>”</t754>
<t755>“Always!</t755> <t756>It's a very ugly expression.</t756> <t757>As soon as I hear it, my blood freezes.</t757> <t758>Women love to use it.</t758> <t759>They ruin every love by trying to make it last forever.</t759> <t760>As a word, it is also meaningless.</t760> <t761>The only difference between a whim and an eternal love is that the whim lasts a little longer.</t761><t762>”</t762>
<t763>As they entered the studio, Dorian Gray placed his hand on Lord Henry's arm.</t763> <t764>"Then let our friendship be a whim," he said, and his face turned crimson at his own audacity.</t764> <t765>Then he stepped onto the platform and resumed his previous pose.</t765>
<t766>Lord Henry, dropping himself into a wide wicker chair, began to gaze at him.</t766> <t767>The strokes and glides of the brush on the canvas were the only sounds breaking the silence.</t767> <t768>Occasionally, Hall would step back a bit to look at his work from a distance.</t768> <t769>Golden-colored dust danced in the slanting rays of light coming through the door.</t769> <t770>The heavy scent of roses had permeated everything.</t770>
<t771>About a quarter of an hour later, Hallward put down the brush.</t771> <t772>For a long time, he looked at Dorian Gray, then, biting the tip of his large brush, he frowned at his work.</t772> <t773>Finally,</t773>
<t774>"Finished, finally!" he shouted, bending over, and wrote his name in long, red letters in the left corner of the canvas.</t774>
<t775>Lord Henry arrived and examined the portrait.</t775> <t776>Without a doubt, it was an extraordinary work of art, exactly like the model.</t776>
<t777>"My dear friend, I congratulate you with all my heart."</t777> <t778>"This is the finest portrait of the contemporary era! Mr. Gray, come and see yourself."</t778><t779>"</t779>
<t780>The young man jolted as if waking from a dream.</t780> <t781>“Is it really over?” he said, stepping down from the platform.</t781>
<t782>“It's truly finished,” said the painter.</t782> <t783>“You posed beautifully today.</t783> <t784>I sincerely thank you.</t784><t785>”</t785>
<t786>Lord Henry said, "It was entirely thanks to me."</t786> <t787>"Isn't that right, Mr. Gray?</t787><t788>"</t788>
<t789>Dorian, without responding, reluctantly moved forward and turned towards his portrait.</t789> <t790>He recoiled when he saw the portrait, his cheeks momentarily flushed with pride.</t790> <t791>As if recognizing himself for the first time, a joy sparkled in his eyes.</t791> <t792>He stood there motionless, as if in a trance.</t792> <t793>Though he vaguely noticed Hallward saying something to him, he couldn't grasp the meaning of the words.</t793> <t794>He had become aware of his own beauty, as if a sacred truth had been revealed.</t794> <t795>He had never felt this before.</t795> <t796>He had considered Basil Hallward's praises as sweet exaggerations of friendship.</t796> <t797>He had listened, laughed, and forgotten.</t797> <t798>These praises had not affected his nature.</t798> <t799>Then Lord Henry had appeared, with that strange ode to youth and his alarming warnings about its brevity.</t799> <t800>The meaning of these words, which had impressed the young man while listening, suddenly struck him with full clarity as he looked at the reflection of his own beauty in the portrait.</t800> <t801>Yes, the day would come when his face would wrinkle and sag, the light and color of his eyes would fade, the delicate harmony of his form would become distorted and misshapen.</t801> <t802>The redness of his lips would pale, the golden sheen of his hair would vanish.</t802> <t803>The life that would develop his soul would disfigure his body.</t803> <t804>He would become something dreadful, repulsive, and cumbersome.</t804>
<t805>The sharp pain that pierced the young man's soul like a knife made the delicate fibers of his being quiver one by one.</t805> <t806>His eyes darkened and turned into amethyst purple, shrouded in a mist of tears.</t806> <t807>It was as if an icy hand had squeezed his heart.</t807>
<t808>The painter, slightly offended by the young man's silence which he couldn't understand, finally burst out, "Didn't you like it?"</t808>
<t809>Lord Henry said, "Of course he liked it."</t809> <t810>"Who wouldn't like this?</t810> <t811>It's one of the greatest works of contemporary art.</t811> <t812>I'll give you whatever you want in exchange for this painting.</t812> <t813>It must be mine.</t813><t814>"</t814>
<t815>“The painting doesn't belong to me, Harry.</t815><t816>”</t816>
<t817>"Whose is it?</t817><t818>"</t818>
<t819>“Of course to Dorian,” replied the painter.</t819>
<t820>“He was a very lucky child.</t820><t821>”</t821>
<t822>Dorian Gray murmured, "How sad!" without taking his eyes off his own portrait.</t822> <t823>"How sad it is!</t823> <t824>I will grow old and become ugly, I will be hideous.</t824> <t825>Yet this picture will remain young forever.</t825> <t826>It will never be older than this June day...</t826> <t827>If only it could be the other way around!</t827> <t828>If I could remain young forever, and this picture would grow old!</t828> <t829>For that...</t829> <t830>I would give everything for that!</t830> <t831>Yes, there is nothing in the whole world I wouldn't give!</t831> <t832>I would even sell my soul for that!</t832><t833>"</t833>
<t834>Lord Henry laughed and said, "Basil, such a bargain would not suit you."</t834> <t835>"It would be unfair to your work.</t835><t836>"</t836>
<t837>The painter replied, "I would have already opposed it with all my might, Harry."</t837>
<t838>Dorian Gray turned and looked at him.</t838> <t839>"I believe it, Basil.</t839> <t840>You value your art above your friends. In your eyes, I am no different from a bronze statue.</t840> <t841>I am not even worth that much!</t841><t842>"</t842>
<t843>The painter was left staring in astonishment.</t843> <t844>Such a conversation was something completely unexpected from Dorian Gray.</t844> <t845>What had happened?</t845> <t846>The young man looked quite angry. Blood had rushed to his face, and his cheeks were burning.</t846>
<t847>“Yes,” he continued speaking.</t847> <t848>“In your eyes, I am even less important than that ivory Hermes, that silver Faun.</t848> <t849>You will love them for a lifetime.</t849> <t850>How long will you love me?</t850> <t851>Probably until the first wrinkle appears on my face.</t851> <t852>Now I have learned: When a person loses their beauty, they lose everything.</t852> <t853>Your portrait taught me that.</t853> <t854>Lord Henry Wotton is absolutely right.</t854> <t855>The only thing worth having is youth.</t855> <t856>When I see that I am starting to age, I will kill myself.</t856><t857>”</t857>
<t858>Hallward turned pale and grasped the young man's hand.</t858> <t859>“Dorian!” he cried.</t859> <t860>“Dorian, don't talk like that.</t860> <t861>I've never had a friend like you before, and I never will again.</t861> <t862>You're not trying to envy material, worldly things, are you?</t862> <t863>You are above all of them.</t863><t864>”</t864>
<t865>“I envy everything whose beauty does not die.</t865> <t866>I envy the portrait you drew.</t866> <t867>Why should it keep what I have lost!</t867> <t868>Every passing minute takes something away from me while adding something to it.</t868> <t869>Ah, if only it could be the other way around!</t869> <t870>If only the picture changed and I could remain as I am!</t870> <t871>Why did you do this?</t871> <t872>One day this picture will mock me, mock me terribly!” Tears filled his eyes.</t872> <t873>He pulled his hand away as if tearing it off, threw himself onto the couch, and buried his face in the pillows as if praying.</t873>
<t874>The painter bitterly said, "This is your doing, Harry!"</t874>
<t875>Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders.</t875> <t876>“The real Dorian Gray before us...</t876> <t877>That's all.</t877><t878>”</t878>
<t879>“It is not!</t879><t880>”</t880>
<t881>“If not, then what?</t881><t882>”</t882>
<t883>The painter muttered, "You were supposed to leave when I asked."</t883>
<t884>Lord Henry replied, "I stayed when you asked."</t884>
<t885>“Harry, I can't get into a fight with both of my best friends at once, but you two have teamed up and made me lose my passion for my best work; so I will destroy this painting.</t885> <t886>But after all, isn't it just canvas and paint?</t886> <t887>I can't allow it to cast a shadow and wound all three of our lives.</t887><t888>”</t888>
<t889>Dorian Gray lifted his golden head from the pillow and watched with his pale face and tearful eyes as Basil walked towards the pine easel standing by the window.</t889> <t890>What was the painter doing there?</t890> <t891>His fingers were moving around, searching for something among the tangled tin tubes and dry brushes.</t891> <t892>Yes, he was looking for that long palette knife made of flexible, thin steel.</t892> <t893>There, he had finally found it.</t893> <t894>He was going to cut and slice the canvas.</t894>
<t895>Dorian sprang up with a choked sob, leaping onto Hallward and snatching the knife from his hand, then hurling it to the opposite corner of the studio.</t895> <t896>"Don't do it, Basil, don't do it!" he was shouting.</t896> <t897>"This would be murder!</t897><t898>"</t898>
<t899>When the painter's astonishment passed, he said coldly, "I'm glad you finally appreciate the value of the painting I made, Dorian."</t899> <t900>"I thought you would never know."</t900><t901>"</t901>
<t902>"Appreciate its value? </t902><t903>I'm infatuated with this painting, Basil. </t903><t904>It's a part of my existence. </t904><t905>That's how it feels to me. </t905><t906>"</t906>
<t907>“Well then, as soon as my paints dry, I will apply a varnish over it, then frame it and send it to your home.</t907> <t908>Then you can do whatever you want with it.”</t908> <t909>Saying this, the painter walked towards the door and rang the bell to ask for tea.</t909> <t910>“You will stay for tea, won't you, Dorian?</t910> <t911>Will you stay too, Harry? Or do you object to such small pleasures?</t911><t912>”</t912>
<t913>“I adore small pleasures,” said Lord Henry.</t913> <t914>“They are the last refuge of complex souls.</t914> <t915>But I do not like theater scenes played offstage.</t915> <t916>How ridiculous you both are!</t916> <t917>I wonder who first called man a rational animal?</t917> <t918>It is the most premature definition ever given.</t918> <t919>Man can be many things, but rational is not one of them.</t919> <t920>And I am glad he is not; still, I do not want you quarreling over this painting.</t920> <t921>Basil, you better give it to me.</t921> <t922>He does not actually want this silly portrait, whereas I truly do.</t922><t923>”</t923>
<t924>Dorian Gray shouted, "Basil, if you give this to anyone else, I will never forgive you in this world!"</t924> <t925>"I also won't allow anyone to call me a fool!</t925><t926>"</t926>
<t927>"This painting is yours, Dorian, you know that.</t927> <t928>I gave it to you before it even existed.</t928><t929>"</t929>
<t930>“You also know that you are acting a bit silly, Mr. Gray.</t930> <t931>You actually have no objection to the emphasis on your youth.</t931><t932>”</t932>
<t933>“If it were this morning, I would strongly object, Lord Henry.</t933><t934>”</t934>
<t935>“Ha! This morning! You have lived a lifetime since then.</t935><t936>”</t936>
<t937>There was a knock at the door, the servant entered with a full tea tray in his hand, and placed the tray on a small Japanese table.</t937> <t938>There was the clinking of a cup and saucer, and the whistle of an antique grooved teapot was heard.</t938> <t939>A young servant's assistant brought two porcelain plates.</t939> <t940>They had dome-shaped covers on them.</t940> <t941>Dorian took his place at the tray and poured the tea.</t941> <t942>The two men approached the table with lazy steps and looked at what was under the covers.</t942>
<t943>Lord Henry said, "Let's go to the theater tonight."</t943> <t944>"There must be something going on somewhere.</t944> <t945>I have a dinner appointment at White's with a very old friend.</t945> <t946>I'll tell him that I'm sick or that something came up.</t946> <t947>It would be very pleasant to offer such an excuse, I think: It creates the surprise of candor.</t947><t948>"</t948>
<t949>Hallward grumbled, "Wearing formal attire is so annoying!"</t949> <t950>"And it looks so bad when you put it on.</t950><t951>"</t951>
<t952>Lord Henry replied absentmindedly, "Yes."</t952> <t953>"The attire of the nineteenth century is truly disgusting.</t953> <t954>So dreary, so gloomy!</t954> <t955>The only thing that adds color to today's life is sin.</t955><t956>"</t956>
<t957>“Harry, you shouldn't talk like that in front of Dorian, I'm serious.</t957><t958>”</t958>
<t959>“In front of which Dorian?</t959> <t960>The one who served our tea, or the one in the portrait?</t960><t961>”</t961>
<t962>"Both of them."</t962><t963>"</t963>
<t964>The young man said, "I want to go to the theater with you, Lord Henry."</t964>
<t965>“Come then.</t965> <t966>You will come too, won't you, Basil?</t966><t967>”</t967>
<t968>“Believe me, I can't come.</t968> <t969>I don't feel like it.</t969> <t970>I have a lot of work.</t970><t971>”</t971>
<t972>"Well then.</t972> <t973>You and I are going alone, Mr. Gray.</t973><t974>"</t974>
<t975>"I would be so happy!"</t975><t976>"</t976>
<t977>The painter, biting his lip, went to the painting with a tea glass in his hand.</t977> <t978>In a sad voice, he said, "I am also staying with the real Dorian Gray."</t978>
<t979>The model for the portrait walked towards the painter, asking, "Is this the real Dorian Gray?"</t979> <t980>"Is this really how I am?</t980><t981>"</t981>
<t982>“Yes, you are just like this.</t982><t983>”</t983>
<t984>"This is wonderful, Basil!"</t984><t985></t985>
<t986>Hallward, "So this is how you look.</t986> <t987>And this picture will never change," he sighed.</t987> <t988>"That's something.</t988><t989>"</t989>
<t990>Lord Henry murmured, "How people exaggerate the matter of loyalty!"</t990> <t991>"Even love is merely a physiological issue.</t991> <t992>It has nothing to do with our own will.</t992> <t993>Young people want to be faithful, but they cannot; old people want to be unfaithful, but they cannot.</t993> <t994>That's all there is to say.</t994><t995>"</t995>
<t996>“Dorian, don't go to the theater tonight,” said Hallward.</t996> <t997>“Stay and have dinner with me.</t997><t998>”</t998>
<t999>“My pen, Basil.”</t999><t1000>”</t1000>
<t1001>“Why?</t1001><t1002>”</t1002>
<t1003>“I promised to go with Lord Henry Wotton, that's why.</t1003><t1004>”</t1004>
<t1005>“She won't love you more just because you kept your word.</t1005> <t1006>She always breaks her promises.</t1006> <t1007>I beg you, don't go.</t1007><t1008>”</t1008>
<t1009>Dorian Gray shook his head with a laugh, indicating no.</t1009>
<t1010>“I am pleading from the heart.</t1010><t1011>”</t1011>
<t1012>The young man hesitated; he looked at Lord Henry, who was watching them from the head of the tea table with a sly smile.</t1012>
<t1013>"I must go, Basil."</t1013><t1014>"</t1014>
<t1015>“Well, then,” said Hallward.</t1015> <t1016>He went and placed the teacup on the tray.</t1016> <t1017>“It's getting late; since you still have to change your outfit, it would be best not to waste too much time.</t1017> <t1018>Goodbye, Harry.</t1018> <t1019>Goodbye, Dorian.</t1019> <t1020>Do come again; don't take too long.</t1020> <t1021>Come tomorrow.</t1021><t1022>”</t1022>
<t1023>“There there.</t1023><t1024>”</t1024>
<t1025>“You won't forget, right?</t1025><t1026>”</t1026>
<t1027>Dorian replied, "What do you mean, of course I won't forget."</t1027>
<t1028>"You too, Harry...</t1028><t1029>"</t1029>
<t1030>"Sir, Basil?"</t1030>
<t1031>"Don't forget the thing I asked of you in the garden this morning."</t1031><t1032>"</t1032>
<t1033>"I forgot, it's gone."</t1033><t1034>"</t1034>
<t1035>"I trust you.</t1035><t1036>"</t1036>
<t1037>Lord Henry said, "I wish I could trust myself!" laughing.</t1037> <t1038>"Come on, Mr. Gray, my carriage is outside.</t1038> <t1039>I can take you home.</t1039> <t1040>Goodbye, Basil.</t1040> <t1041>We had a very interesting afternoon, indeed.</t1041><t1042>"</t1042>
<t1043>When the door closed behind the guests, the painter let himself fall onto a couch, a pained expression appearing on his face.</t1043>
<t1044>Third chapter</t1044>
<t1045>The next day at half-past twelve, Lord Henry Wotton left Curzon Street and headed towards the Albany Hotel to visit his uncle, Lord Fermor.</t1045> <t1046>The world, which could not derive any benefit from Lord Fermor, who was a cheerful, talkative, and friendly old man despite some of his blunt behaviors, accused him of selfishness.</t1046> <t1047>However, society considered him generous because Lord Fermor would feed those who entertained him.</t1047> <t1048>His father had been the Ambassador to Madrid during Isabella's youth, long before Prim was even thought of, but he had quit the diplomatic profession in a fit of anger when he was not made Ambassador to Paris.</t1048> <t1049>Lord Fermor believed he fully deserved this position due to his lineage, mischief, the reports he prepared, his eloquence, and his excessive love of pleasure and luxury.</t1049>
<t1050>His son, who was acting as his secretary, had also submitted his resignation along with him.</t1050> <t1051>It was thought that he had been a bit foolish at the time.</t1051> <t1052>A few months later, the new Lord Fermor, who inherited his father's title, dedicated himself to seriously studying that magnificent art of aristocracy, namely the art of doing absolutely nothing.</t1052> <t1053>He had two huge houses in the city, but preferred to stay in a hotel suite because it was less troublesome, and usually had his meals there as well.</t1053> <t1054>He took a slight interest in managing the coal mines he owned around the Midlands, and to excuse the stain on his honor for making this effort, he would say, "There is only one benefit of coal: it provides the upper class with the privilege of burning wood in their own fireplaces!"</t1054>
<t1055>Politically, he was a Tory, except when the Tories were in power.</t1055> <t1056>During such times, Lord Fermor would denounce them as a "pack of Radicals" and condemn them vehemently.</t1056> <t1057>In the eyes of his personal valet, who managed him with an overbearing authority, Lord Fermor was a hero, while to his relatives, whom he managed with the same overbearing authority, he was a tyrant.</t1057> <t1058>Only England could have produced him, and he was always saying that the country was going to the dogs.</t1058> <t1059>His principles might have been somewhat outdated, but there was no denying his prejudices.</t1059>
<t1060>When Lord Henry entered, he found his uncle grumbling while reading the Times newspaper, puffing on a leaf cigar, and wearing a sports jacket.</t1060>
<t1061>"Well, Harry," said the old man.</t1061> <t1062>"What are you doing here so early?</t1062> <t1063>I thought you high-society fops wouldn't get out of bed before two and wouldn't show your faces before five.</t1063><t1064>"</t1064>
<t1065>“Believe me, Uncle George, it is purely familial love that brought me here.</t1065> <t1066>I want to get something from you!</t1066><t1067>”</t1067>
<t1068>Lord Fermor grimaced, "It must be about money," he said.</t1068> <t1069>"Anyway, sit down and tell me about it.</t1069> <t1070>Young people these days think that money is everything in life.</t1070><t1071>"</t1071>
<t1072>Lord Henry murmured, "Yes."</t1072> <t1073>"They know this to be true even when they grow old.</t1073> <t1074>However, what I want is not money.</t1074> <t1075>Only those who pay their debts want money, dear Uncle George, whereas I never pay my debts.</t1075> <t1076>The capital of the younger sons of nobles is credit, and one can live quite pleasantly with this credit.</t1076> <t1077>Besides, I always do business with the Dartmoor tradesmen, so they never bother me.</t1077> <t1078>No, what I want is knowledge.</t1078> <t1079>Not useful knowledge, of course, but useless knowledge.</t1079><t1080>"</t1080>
<t1081>"Well, Harry, I can relay to you any information you want from the Blue Book of England.</t1081> <t1082>Although, nowadays, the guys who write it have gone crazy.</t1082> <t1083>When I was in the diplomatic service, things were more orderly.</t1083> <t1084>But now, from what I hear, they even hire people there through exams.</t1084> <t1085>That thing called an exam, my friend, is nonsense from start to finish.</t1085> <t1086>If a person is a gentleman from the polite society, what he knows is more than enough for him.</t1086> <t1087>If he's not a gentleman, everything he knows is harmful to him.</t1087><t1088>"</t1088>
<t1089>Lord Henry said in his lazy voice, "Mr. Dorian Gray has no place in the Blue Book, Uncle George."</t1089>
<t1090>Lord Fermor furrowed his bushy white eyebrows and asked, "Dorian Gray?"</t1090> <t1091>"Who is he?</t1091><t1092>"</t1092>
<t1093>"That's exactly what I came to learn, Uncle George.</t1093> <t1094>Or rather, I don't know who he is.</t1094> <t1095>The grandson of the late Lord Kelso.</t1095> <t1096>His mother was from the Devereux family, Lady Margaret Devereux.</t1096> <t1097>I want you to tell me about her.</t1097> <t1098>What kind of woman was she?</t1098> <t1099>Whom did she marry?</t1099> <t1100>You've known almost everyone in your time; perhaps you knew her too.</t1100> <t1101>I'm currently very interested in Mr. Gray.</t1101> <t1102>We just met recently.</t1102><t1103>"</t1103>
<t1104>The old Lord repeated his nephew's words, "Kelso's grandson!"</t1104> <t1105>"Kelso's grandson!..</t1105> <t1106>Of course...</t1106> <t1107>I knew his mother very well.</t1107> <t1108>I was present at her christening, if I'm not mistaken.</t1108> <t1109>She was an extraordinarily beautiful girl, this Margaret Devereux.</t1109> <t1110>Then she eloped with a penniless young man, driving all her admirers crazy.</t1110> <t1111>The young man she eloped with was a nobody, sir, a sergeant in an infantry regiment or something like that.</t1111> <t1112>Of course.</t1112> <t1113>It's all as clear as if it were yesterday.</t1113> <t1114>Poor boy, he died in a duel in Spa a few months after the wedding.</t1114> <t1115>There was an ugly rumor about it.</t1115> <t1116>They said Kelso had hired a lowlife to insult his son-in-law in public.</t1116> <t1117>The guy was a Belgian brute.</t1117> <t1118>Apparently, Kelso paid this guy; literally paid him, and the Belgian shot his prey like a sitting duck.</t1118> <t1119>The incident was covered up, sir, but after that, no one at the club would go near Kelso.</t1119> <t1120>I heard he brought his daughter back, but she never spoke to him again.</t1120> <t1121>Yes, it was a dirty business, to be honest.</t1121> <t1122>The girl died too, within a year she was dead.</t1122> <t1123>So she left behind a son?</t1123> <t1124>I had forgotten that.</t1124> <t1125>What does the boy look like?</t1125> <t1126>If he looks like his mother, he must be handsome.</t1126><t1127>”</t1127>
<t1128>Lord Henry, "Very handsome," he confirmed his uncle.</t1128>
<t1129>The old Lord continued, "I hope he falls into the right hands," he said.</t1129> <t1130>"If Kelso has done what is necessary, the child should come into a pot of money.</t1130> <t1131>His mother was wealthy too.</t1131> <t1132>She had inherited all the Selbys' property from her grandfather.</t1132> <t1133>This grandfather hated Kelso, called him a treacherous animal.</t1133> <t1134>And indeed he was.</t1134> <t1135>He had come to Madrid once, while I was there.</t1135> <t1136>He had humiliated me.</t1136> <t1137>The Queen would always ask me about the English nobleman who got into fights with the coachmen over fares.</t1137> <t1138>The coachmen would embellish the stories.</t1138> <t1139>I couldn't show my face at the palace for a whole month.</t1139> <t1140>I hope he didn't do to his grandson what he did to the coachmen.</t1140><t1141>"</t1141>
<t1142>“I don't know,” said Lord Henry.</t1142> <t1143>“I don't think the child will be left without money.</t1143> <t1144>He hasn't even reached adolescence yet.</t1144> <t1145>Selby is looking after him.</t1145> <t1146>I know, he told me himself.</t1146> <t1147>So...</t1147> <t1148>His mother was very beautiful, huh?</t1148><t1149>”</t1149>
<t1150>“Harry, Margaret Devereux was one of the most beautiful creatures I have ever seen.</t1150> <t1151>What possessed her to get involved in such things, I will never know.</t1151> <t1152>She could have married anyone she wanted.</t1152> <t1153>Carlington was madly in love with her.</t1153> <t1154>But the girl was romantic.</t1154> <t1155>All the women in that family were romantic.</t1155> <t1156>The men were useless, but the women were truly magnificent!</t1156> <t1157>Carlington had knelt down and begged Margaret, he himself told me.</t1157> <t1158>Margaret just laughed it off, even though at that time every girl in London was after Carlington.</t1158> <t1159>Oh, now that I remember, Harry...</t1159> <t1160>We were talking about unsuitable marriages...</t1160> <t1161>From what I heard from your father, Dartmoor wants to marry some American, what is this scandal?</t1161> <t1162>What’s wrong with English girls?</t1162><t1163>”</t1163>
<t1164>"Uncle George, marrying Americans has become a bit of a trend these days."</t1164><t1165>"</t1165>
<t1166>Lord Fermor slammed his fist on the table and said, "Harry, I think English women are one thing, and the world is another."</t1166>
<t1167>“But Americans are favorites.</t1167><t1168>”</t1168>
<t1169>“I hear they are not durable,”</t1169><t1170>”</t1170>
<t1171>"If the match lasts long, they get tired and exhausted, but when it comes to straight running, there's no one better than them.</t1171> <t1172>It's as if they're flying!</t1172> <t1173>I don't give Dartmoor any chance at all.</t1173><t1174>"</t1174>
<t1175>The old Lord grumbled, "Who are his family?" he asked.</t1175> <t1176>"Or rather, does he even have a family?</t1176><t1177>"</t1177>
<t1178>Lord Henry nodded his head.</t1178> <t1179>“While English women are adept at hiding their pasts, American girls are equally cunning at hiding their parents,” he said, standing up to leave.</t1179>
<t1180>“They must be working at a pig slaughterhouse or something, isn't that right?</t1180><t1181>”</t1181>
<t1182>"I hope so, Uncle George, for Dartmoor's sake, I hope so."</t1182> <t1183>"They say that after politics, the most profitable profession in America is pig slaughtering."</t1183><t1184>"</t1184>
<t1185>“Is the girl at least beautiful?</t1185><t1186>”</t1186>
<t1187>"As if it's beautiful in the weather.</t1187> <t1188>Most American women are like this.</t1188> <t1189>The secret of their charm is this.</t1189><t1190>"</t1190>
<t1191>“Can't these American women stay in their own country?</t1191> <t1192>They keep bragging that it's a paradise for women there.</t1192><t1193>”</t1193>
<t1194>“America is really like that.</t1194> <t1195>And that's why American women, just like Eve, are eager to escape from there!” said Lord Henry.</t1195> <t1196>“Goodbye, Uncle George.</t1196> <t1197>If I linger a bit more, I'll be late for dinner.</t1197> <t1198>Thank you for giving me the information I wanted.</t1198> <t1199>I've always wanted to know everything about my new friends, but nothing about my old friends...</t1199><t1200>”</t1200>
<t1201>“Where do you eat, Harry?</t1201><t1202>”</t1202>
<t1203>“Agatha is at my aunt's.</t1203> <t1204>I invited myself, and also Mr. Gray.</t1204> <t1205>Mr. Gray is my aunt's latest protégé.</t1205><t1206>”</t1206>
<t1207>“Let them love! Harry, tell Aunt Agatha to stop bothering me with donation requests.</t1207> <t1208>I've had it up to here.</t1208> <t1209>Good grief, the poor woman thinks I have nothing better to do than write checks for her silly obsessions!</t1209><t1210>”</t1210>
<t1211>“Well, uncle, I will tell them, but it will have no effect.</t1211> <t1212>People who are involved in charity work lose all their humanity.</t1212> <t1213>You can distinguish them by this characteristic.</t1213><t1214>”</t1214>
<t1215>The old Lord let out a grunt of approval and rang the bell to call his servant.</t1215> <t1216>Lord Henry passed under the low arch and stepped out onto Burlington Street, from where he directed his steps towards Berkeley Square.</t1216>
<t1217>So, this was the story of Dorian Gray's parents.</t1217><t1218>Despite being told in broad strokes, this story had excited him by evoking a strange, contemporary romanticism.</t1218><t1219>A beautiful woman who sacrificed everything for a mad passion.</t1219><t1220>A few weeks of wild happiness ending in a vile, treacherous murder.</t1220><t1221>Months of silent suffering, then a child born in pain.</t1221><t1222>The mother being taken by death, the child left alone in the hands of an old, loveless man.</t1222><t1223>Yes, an interesting background.</t1223><t1224>It formed a backdrop for Dorian, making him seem even more perfect.</t1224><t1225>Behind every perfect thing, there was hidden pain.</t1225><t1226>It was as if the world had to suffer for the most ordinary flower to bloom...</t1226><t1227>The boy had sat across from Lord Henry at the dinner they had at the club the previous night, with startled eyes and lips parted with timid pleasure, as the red shades of the candelabras painted the slowly awakening consciousness on his face a deeper rose color, how sweet he had been.</t1227><t1228>Talking to him was like playing a fine violin.</t1228><t1229>The boy responded to every touch, every pull of the bow...</t1229><t1230>There was something immensely enveloping about wielding one's influence in this way.</t1230><t1231>No other occupation could compare to this.</t1231><t1232>To transfer one's own soul into a separate, beautiful form and hold it there for a while, to have one's thoughts echoed, to add the music of youth and excitement to it, and to transmit one's own temperament and attitude, like a slippery liquid, a mysterious scent, to another.</t1232><t1233>There was a true joy in this...</t1233><t1234>Perhaps in an era as limited and crude as ours, with pleasures roughly sensual and goals roughly vulgar, this was the most fulfilling joy left to us...</t1234><t1235>Then, by a strange coincidence, this boy he had met in Basil's studio had a wonderful personality; or at least his personality could be shaped into a wonderful form.</t1235><t1236>He had elegance, the pure clarity of youth, and the beauty that ancient Greek marbles had preserved for us.</t1236><t1237>There was no shape that could not be given to this boy.</t1237><t1238>He could be made into a titan or a toy.</t1238><t1239>But how sad it was that such beauty was destined to fade away...</t1239><t1240>And Basil? How interesting he was from a psychological standpoint!</t1240><t1241>A new art method, a completely different perspective on life...</t1241><t1242>The mere visible presence of the young man had evoked these in the painter, while the young man was completely unaware of them.</t1242><t1243>That silent, feminine spirit living in dim groves, wandering unseen in the open fields, suddenly revealed itself, fearless, like the forest goddesses.</t1243><t1244>A marvelous eye had opened in the painter's own soul, and marvelous things could only be seen by this eye.</t1244><t1245>Thus, the simplest lines and forms of objects had become refined and exalted, gaining a symbolic value, as if they were examples of a completely different and more perfect form, and these forms made their shadows real.</t1245><t1246>How strange all this was!</t1246><t1247>Lord Henry seemed to recall something similar in history.</t1247><t1248>Was it not Plato, that painter of thoughts, who first examined this?</t1248><t1249>Was it not Buonarroti who first carved this into the colorful marbles of a sonnet?</t1249><t1250>Yet in our current age, such a thing was startling.</t1250><t1251>Yes, just as Dorian Gray had unknowingly symbolized something to the painter who drew that wonderful portrait, Lord Henry would try to make Dorian Gray symbolize it to him.</t1251><t1252>He would try to dominate him, and he was already halfway there, even now.</t1252><t1253>He would claim that beautiful soul for himself.</t1253><t1254>There was an enchanting allure in this child of love and death.</t1254>
<t1255>Suddenly, Lord Henry stopped and looked at the houses beside him.</t1255> <t1256>Seeing that he had passed his aunt's house by quite a bit, he turned back with a smile to himself.</t1256> <t1257>When he entered the somewhat gloomy hall, the head butler informed him that dinner had started.</t1257> <t1258>Lord Henry handed his hat and cane to one of the footmen and entered the dining room.</t1258>
<t1259>His aunt looked at him, shaking her head, and shouted, "You're late, Harry!"</t1259> <t1260>"As always.</t1260><t1261>"</t1261>
<t1262>Lord Henry uttered the first excuse that came to his tongue, and, sitting in the empty seat next to his aunt, looked around to see who was present at the table.</t1262> <t1263>Dorian, sitting at the far end of the table, looked at him shyly and smiled, a joyful color spreading across his face.</t1263> <t1264>Opposite him was Duchess Harley, whose good nature and kind heart were greatly admired, and who was loved by all her acquaintances.</t1264> <t1265>Modern historians, when they encounter the architectural proportions of this lady in women who are not duchesses, describe them as "stout."</t1265> <t1266>To her right sat Sir Thomas Burdon, a radical member of Parliament.</t1266> <t1267>He adhered to a well-known, wise rule by following his leader in public life and the most skilled chefs in private life, dining with the Tories and thinking with the Liberals...</t1267>
<t1268>On his right sat Mr. Erskine of Treadley.</t1268> <t1269>This elderly gentleman, who possessed considerable charm and culture, unfortunately had acquired the bad habit of silence, because, as he once explained to Lady Agatha, he believed he had said everything he had to say before the age of thirty.</t1269> <t1270>Next to Lord Henry was Ms. Vandeleur, one of his aunt's oldest friends: An angelic woman, yet so dowdy and shabby that she reminded one of a poorly bound prayer book.</t1270> <t1271>Lord Henry was fortunate that on the other side of the woman sat Lord Faudel, an extremely intelligent, middle-aged, and mediocre person.</t1271> <t1272>Lord Faudel had a completely bald head, like a wasted ministerial promise in the House of Commons.</t1272> <t1273>Ms. Vandeleur was speaking to him with utmost sincere honesty.</t1273> <t1274>As Lord Henry once said, this sincere honesty was the only unforgivable mistake that all truly good people fell into and from which none could entirely escape.</t1274>
<t1275>The Duchess, laughing and nodding her head from the other side of the table, said, "We were talking about poor Dartmoor, Lord Henry."</t1275> <t1276>"Do you think Dartmoor will really marry this charming young girl?</t1276><t1277>"</t1277>
<t1278>“I think the girl was determined to propose to him, Duchess.</t1278><t1279>”</t1279>
<t1280>Lady Agatha shouted, "What have I done!"</t1280> <t1281>"Someone must stop this.</t1281><t1282>"</t1282>
<t1283>Sir Thomas Burdon said with a haughty expression, "I have heard from a reliable source that the girl's father runs a dry goods store in America."</t1283>
<t1284>The Duchess, opening her large hands in astonishment, "Fabric!</t1284> <t1285>What is American fabric?" she asked.</t1285>
<t1286>Lord Henry, taking some quail onto his plate, responded, "American novels."</t1286>
<t1287>The Duchess seemed to understand nothing.</t1287> <t1288>Lady Agatha whispered, "Don't pay attention to her, darling."</t1288> <t1289>"You shouldn't take any of her words seriously.</t1289><t1290>"</t1290>
<t1291>The Radical Parliament member began his speech with, "When America was discovered," and proceeded to list a series of tedious facts.</t1291> <t1292>Like all people who try to exhaust a topic, he eventually exhausted the patience of his listeners.</t1292>
<t1293>The Duchess sighed and used the interruption to cut off the person in front of her: "I wish it had never been discovered!" she exclaimed softly.</t1293> <t1294>"God knows, our daughters have no chance anymore.</t1294> <t1295>This is a great injustice.</t1295><t1296>"</t1296>
<t1297>Mr. Erskine said, "Perhaps America was never actually discovered."</t1297> <t1298>"If you ask me, it was only revealed.</t1298><t1299>"</t1299>
<t1300>The Duchess said, "Ha! But I have seen examples of the natives from there."</t1300> <t1301>"To be honest, most of them are quite attractive.</t1301> <t1302>They also dress well.</t1302> <t1303>They get all their outfits from Paris.</t1303> <t1304>I wish my situation allowed for that!</t1304><t1305>"</t1305>
<t1306>Sir Thomas chuckled, "They say that good Americans go to Paris when they die."</t1306> <t1307>His wardrobe was filled with Humour's second-hand clothes.</t1307>
<t1308>The Duchess said, "Don't say that!"</t1308> <t1309>"Well, where do bad Americans go when they die?"</t1309><t1310></t1310>
<t1311>Lord Henry murmured, "To America."</t1311>
<t1312>Sir Thomas frowned.</t1312> <t1313>He said to Lady Agatha, "I am afraid your nephew has a prejudice against this great country."</t1313> <t1314>"I have traveled every inch of this country with the carriages provided by the administrators, who are extremely kind in these matters.</t1314> <t1315>Believe me, this journey in itself is an education."</t1315><t1316>"</t1316>
<t1317>Mr. Erskine complained, "But do we really have to go to Chicago to get an education?"</t1317> <t1318>"Personally, I can't take such a risk.</t1318><t1319>"</t1319>
<t1320>Sir Thomas waved his hand.</t1320> <t1321>“The world is hidden on the bookshelves for Mr. Erskine with his Treadley.</t1321> <t1322>But we practical people prefer to see things in the world rather than read about them.</t1322> <t1323>Americans are an extremely interesting people.</t1323> <t1324>Completely rational individuals.</t1324> <t1325>I think that is their distinguishing characteristic.</t1325> <t1326>Yes, Mr. Erskine, a completely rational, logical society.</t1326> <t1327>Rest assured.</t1327> <t1328>There is nothing nonsensical about Americans.</t1328><t1329>”</t1329>
<t1330>Lord Henry, "I didn't do it!" he said.</t1330> <t1331>"I can endure absolute power, but absolute logic is unbearable.</t1331> <t1332>I find an injustice in the use of such a thing.</t1332> <t1333>I consider it a blow below the belt.</t1333><t1334>"</t1334>
<t1335>Sir Thomas, with his face slightly reddening, said, "I don't understand you."</t1335>
<t1336>Mr. Erskine murmured with a smile, "I understand."</t1336>
<t1337>Sir Thomas began to speak, "A contradiction is endured in its time, but..."</t1337>
<t1338>Mr. Erskine asked, "Was this a contradiction?"</t1338> <t1339>"It didn't seem so to me.</t1339> <t1340>But maybe it was.</t1340> <t1341>Well, the path to truth passes through contradiction.</t1341> <t1342>If we want to test the truth, we must first see it on the tightrope.</t1342> <t1343>We can only measure truths when they become acrobats.</t1343><t1344>"</t1344>
<t1345>Lady Agatha said, "Look here!"</t1345> <t1346>"You men just love to argue.</t1346> <t1347>I can never understand what you're talking about, honestly.</t1347> <t1348>Oh, Harry, I'm very angry with you.</t1348> <t1349>What's the point of trying to dissuade our dear Mr. Dorian Gray from going to the East End?</t1349> <t1350>It will be extremely beneficial for us, believe me.</t1350> <t1351>Everyone will love his piano playing.</t1351><t1352>"</t1352>
<t1353>Lord Henry smiled and said, "I want him to play the piano for me."</t1353> <t1354>He looked to the other end of the table and caught a sparkling smile that answered his own.</t1354>
<t1355>Lady Agatha continued, "But the ones in Whitechapel are so unhappy!"</t1355>
<t1356>Lord Henry shrugged, "I can sympathize with everything in the world except suffering," he said.</t1356> <t1357>"That is something I cannot sympathize with.</t1357> <t1358>It is excessively ugly, tragic, and distressing.</t1358> <t1359>There is something extremely morbid in our age's affinity for pain.</t1359> <t1360>One should show affinity for the color, beauty, and joy of life.</t1360> <t1361>The less we talk about life's festering wounds, the better, in my opinion.</t1361><t1362>"</t1362>
<t1363>Sir Thomas shook his head seriously and said, "Nevertheless, the East End is a very important issue."</t1363>
<t1364>The Young Lord said, "Indeed, very much so!"</t1364> <t1365>"East End is a slavery problem, and we are trying to solve it by entertaining the slaves.</t1365><t1366>"</t1366>
<t1367>The politician squinted his eyes and looked at him.</t1367> <t1368>“So, what kind of change are you proposing?” he asked.</t1368>
<t1369>Lord Henry laughed.</t1369> <t1370>“There is nothing I want to change in England except the weather,” he replied.</t1370> <t1371>“Delving into philosophical thoughts is enough for me.</t1371> <t1372>The fact is, since the nineteenth century has gone bankrupt due to our reckless squandering of understanding and compassion, my suggestion is that we turn to science to correct us.</t1372> <t1373>The advantage of emotions is that they lead us astray; the advantage of science is that it is not emotional.</t1373><t1374>”</t1374>
<t1375>Ms. Vandeleur hesitantly suggested, "But we bear such heavy and serious responsibilities!"</t1375>
<t1376>“Extremely serious and grave,” Lady Agatha repeated his words.</t1376>
<t1377>Lord Henry looked towards Mr. Erskine.</t1377> <t1378>"Man takes himself too seriously.</t1378> <t1379>This is the first sin the world committed.</t1379> <t1380>If the caveman knew how to laugh, history would be very different.</t1380><t1381>"</t1381>
<t1382>The Duchess said in a cheerful voice, “You put my mind at ease.”</t1382> <t1383>“I always feel guilty when I come to see your dear aunt, because the East End doesn't interest me in the slightest.</t1383> <t1384>From now on, I won't blush with shame when I look at your aunt's face.</t1384><t1385>”</t1385>
<t1386>Lord Henry, "Blushing becomes a person, Duchess," he opined.</t1386>
<t1387>The Duchess said, "But only for the young."</t1387> <t1388>"For an old woman like me, blushing is a bad sign.</t1388> <t1389>Oh, Lord Henry, I wish you could show me how to be young again!</t1389><t1390>"</t1390>
<t1391>Lord Henry thought for a moment.</t1391> <t1392>Then, looking at the woman in front of him, he asked, "Can you recall a great mistake you made in your old days, Duchess?"</t1392>
<t1393>“I'm afraid quite a lot!”</t1393><t1394>”</t1394>
<t1395>Lord Henry replied seriously, "Then do them again."</t1395> <t1396>"To regain one's youth, one only needs to repeat one's follies.</t1396><t1397>"</t1397>
<t1398>The Duchess said, "A wonderful theory."</t1398> <t1399>"I must apply it immediately.</t1399><t1400>"</t1400>
<t1401>Sir Thomas spoke with pursed lips, "A dangerous theory!"</t1401>
<t1402>Lady Agatha nodded her head but couldn't help feeling amused.</t1402> <t1403>Mr. Erskine was all ears.</t1403>
<t1404>Lord Henry added, "Yes."</t1404> <t1405>"It is one of the great mysteries of life.</t1405> <t1406>Nowadays, most people die of a sort of creeping common sense.</t1406> <t1407>They realize too late that the only things one never regrets are one's mistakes.</t1407><t1408>"</t1408>
<t1409>Laughter circulated around the table.</t1409>
<t1410>Lord Henry became more and more excited as he toyed with this idea.</t1410> <t1411>He tossed the idea into the air, transforming it, letting it slip away only to catch it again, adorning it with fantasies and making it iridescent, attaching wings of contradiction to it.</t1411> <t1412>The praise he lavished on madness soon turned into a philosophy.</t1412> <t1413>Now the philosophy itself had rejuvenated, aligning with the wild music of pleasure and revelry; it seemed as though, dressed in a wine-stained garment and crowned with a laurel wreath, it danced like a Bacchus follower over the hills of life, mocking the slow Silenus for being sober.</t1413> <t1414>Truths fled before him, like timid forest animals.</t1414> <t1415>As his white feet trampled the grapes in wise Omar’s vat, the frothy grape juice rose around his bare legs in waves of purple bubbles, spilling over the wet, sloping, black edge of the vat as a flood of crimson foam.</t1415> <t1416>It was an astonishing improvisation!</t1416> <t1417>Lord Henry sensed that Dorian Gray’s eyes were fixed upon him, and knowing that there was someone among the listeners whom he wanted to dazzle seemed to sharpen his sense of humor and add color to his imagination.</t1417> <t1418>His speech was brilliant, incredible, and irresponsible.</t1418> <t1419>Enchanting his listeners, it was as if he drew them out of themselves, and they followed him merrily to the tune of his pipe.</t1419> <t1420>Dorian Gray sat there as if mesmerized, never taking his eyes off him, smiles chasing each other on his lips, and the astonishment and admiration in his increasingly darkening eyes deepening.</t1420>
<t1421>In the end, reality, dressed in the uniform of the age, entered the room in the guise of a servant and informed the duchess that her carriage was waiting.</t1421> <t1422>The duchess, rubbing her hands with feigned helplessness, exclaimed, "How annoying!"</t1422> <t1423>"I have to go.</t1423> <t1424>I have to pick up my husband from the club and take him to a ridiculous meeting at Willis's house.</t1424> <t1425>He is to preside over the meeting.</t1425> <t1426>If I'm late, he will surely be angry.</t1426> <t1427>And I can't come to a quarrel with this hat on my head.</t1427> <t1428>It's a very delicate hat.</t1428> <t1429>It could be ruined by a harsh word.</t1429> <t1430>No, I must go, dear Agatha.</t1430> <t1431>Goodbye, Lord Henry, you are very sweet and demoralizing.</t1431> <t1432>I don't know what to say about your views.</t1432> <t1433>I invite you to dinner at our place one evening.</t1433> <t1434>How about Tuesday?</t1434> <t1435>Do you have any plans for Tuesday evening?</t1435><t1436>"</t1436>
<t1437>Lord Henry leaned in and said, "I would renounce all my words for you, Duchess."</t1437>
<t1438>The Duchess said, "Oh, very sweet, very shameful!"</t1438> <t1439>"I am waiting, then.</t1439><t1440>"</t1440>
<t1441>With that, he left the room with all his fuss.</t1441> <t1442>Lady Agatha and the other ladies followed him.</t1442>
<t1443>When Lord Henry sat down, Mr. Erskine turned, sat close to him, and placed his hand on his arm.</t1443>
<t1444>“You overshadow books with your words,” he said.</t1444> <t1445>“Why don't you sit down and write a book?</t1445><t1446>”</t1446>
<t1447>“Mr. Erskine, my love for books is so great that it prevents me from writing one.</t1447> <t1448>Although I would love to write a novel, as beautiful as a Persian carpet, and just as fictitious.</t1448> <t1449>However, in England, people read nothing but daily newspapers and encyclopedias!</t1449> <t1450>Among the peoples of the world, the English are the ones who understand the beauty of literature the least.</t1450><t1451>”</t1451>
<t1452>Mr. Erskine said, "I'm afraid you're right."</t1452> <t1453>"I once had literary ambitions myself, but I gave them up years ago.</t1453> <t1454>And now...</t1454> <t1455>If you allow me to call you my young friend...</t1455> <t1456>Were you serious about everything you said at dinner?</t1456><t1457>"</t1457>
<t1458>Lord Henry smiled, "I have completely forgotten what I said."</t1458> <t1459>"Did I say very bad things?</t1459><t1460>"</t1460>
<t1461>“And very bad indeed.</t1461> <t1462>To be honest, in my eyes, you are a very dangerous person.</t1462> <t1463>If anything happens to our dear duchess, we will all see you as the main culprit.</t1463> <t1464>But I would like to talk to you about life.</t1464> <t1465>Our generation turned out to be quite boring.</t1465> <t1466>One day, when you get tired of London, come to Treadley.</t1466> <t1467>By chance, I have some very exquisite Burgundy wine.</t1467> <t1468>While sipping it, you can explain to me in detail this ‘philosophy of pleasure’ of yours.</t1468><t1469>”</t1469>
<t1470>"I would be very happy.</t1470> <t1471>I would consider it a great honor to come and see Treadley.</t1471> <t1472>He is a perfect host, and he has a perfect library.</t1472><t1473>"</t1473>
<t1474>The elderly gentleman, with a polite bow, said, "You will complete Treadley."</t1474> <t1475>"Now I must bid farewell to your esteemed aunt.</t1475> <t1476>They are waiting for me at the Athenaeum Club.</t1476> <t1477>It is the time we sleep there now.</t1477><t1478>"</t1478>
<t1479>“All of you, Mr. Erskine?</t1479><t1480>”</t1480>
<t1481>"Forty of us, all at forty seats.</t1481> <t1482>We are trying to establish an English literature academy.</t1482><t1483>"</t1483>
<t1484>Lord Henry stood up laughing.</t1484> <t1485>"I am going to the park," he said.</t1485>
<t1486>As he was leaving through the door, Dorian Gray touched his arm.</t1486> <t1487>"Allow me to come with you," he murmured.</t1487>
<t1488>Lord Henry, "But I thought you promised to go see Basil Hallward," he said.</t1488>
<t1489>“I would prefer to come with you.</t1489> <t1490>Yes, I feel like being with you.</t1490> <t1491>My dear, let me come with you.</t1491> <t1492>And promise me that you will talk to me without stopping.</t1492> <t1493>No one can talk as wonderfully as you.</t1493><t1494>”</t1494>
<t1495>Lord Henry smiled and said, "No, I've talked enough for today."</t1495> <t1496>"Now, my only desire is to watch life.</t1496> <t1497>If you want, you can come and watch it with me.</t1497><t1498>"</t1498>
<t1499>1.</t1499> <t1500>The general term used for the period's social guide (like a phone directory) is street slang.</t1500> <t1501>(Ç.</t1501> <t1502>N.</t1502><t1503>)</t1503>
<t1504>2.</t1504> <t1505>One of Dionysus's drunken followers in Greek mythology, an ally of the satyrs.</t1505> <t1506>(Ç.</t1506> <t1507>N.</t1507><t1508>)</t1508>
<t1509>Fourth Chapter</t1509>
<t1510>One afternoon, a month later, Dorian Gray was sitting, sunk into an extremely comfortable chair, in the small library of Lord Henry's house in Mayfair.</t1510> <t1511>This room, paneled with oak painted in olive color, with cream-colored cornices and ceiling decorations, and scattered with long-tasseled silk Persian prayer rugs on a brick-red carpet that covered the floor wall-to-wall, had a unique charm of its own.</t1511> <t1512>On a tiny table made of yellow Indian wood stood a small statue by Clodion, and next to it, a copy of Les Cent Nouvelles (The One Hundred New Stories).</t1512> <t1513>This book had been bound by Clovis Eve for Margaret of Valois, with gilded daisies chosen by the Queen herself scattered over it.</t1513> <t1514>On the mantelpiece, large vases of blue porcelain held tulips of various colors; the apricot-colored light of a summer day in London filtered through the small leaded panes of the window.</t1514>
<t1515>Lord Henry had not arrived yet.</t1515> <t1516>He was deliberately late everywhere, as it was his principle to consider punctuality a theft of time.</t1516> <t1517>Therefore, Dorian Gray was sulking quite a bit as he reluctantly flipped through a very intricately illustrated copy of Manon Lescaut he found on one of the shelves.</t1517> <t1518>The monotonous ticking of the Louis Quatorze clock was also getting on his nerves.</t1518> <t1519>A couple of times, he even considered getting up and leaving.</t1519>
<t1520>Finally, he heard footsteps outside; the door opened.</t1520>
<t1521>Dorian complained, "But you're late, Harry!"</t1521>
<t1522>“Unfortunately, not Harry, Mr. Gray,” replied a shrill voice.</t1522>
<t1523>The young man quickly turned his head and stood up.</t1523> <t1524>“I apologize.</t1524> <t1525>I didn't mean to...</t1525><t1526>”</t1526>
<t1527>"You thought I was my husband.</t1527> <t1528>But I'm only his wife!</t1528> <t1529>Allow me to introduce myself.</t1529> <t1530>I know you very well, from your photographs.</t1530> <t1531>I believe my husband has seventeen pictures of you.</t1531><t1532>"</t1532>
<t1533>“There cannot be seventeen, Lady Henry!</t1533><t1534>”</t1534>
<t1535>“Eighteen, then.”</t1535> <t1536>“I saw you next to him at the opera last night.”</t1536> <t1537>The woman laughed nervously as she spoke, scrutinizing the young man with her azure, cloudy eyes.</t1537> <t1538>Her clothes always looked as if they had been designed during a fit of rage and worn amidst a whirlwind.</t1538> <t1539>She was always infatuated with someone, but since her love was never reciprocated, she never lost her dreams.</t1539> <t1540>She tried to appear different and striking, but unfortunately, she only managed to look disheveled.</t1540> <t1541>Her name was Victoria, and she had an irrepressible passion for going to church.</t1541>
<t1542>"It must be in Lohengrin, right, Lady Henry?"</t1542>
<t1543>“Yes, dear, at Lohengrin.</t1543> <t1544>I love Wagner's music the most.</t1544> <t1545>It's so loud that one can talk from start to finish without others hearing what they say.</t1545> <t1546>Isn't that a great privilege, don't you think, Mr. Gray?</t1546><t1547>”</t1547>
<t1548>From her thin lips once again spilled that abrupt, nervous laugh, and she began to play with a long, three-colored letter opener.</t1548>
<t1549>Dorian shook his head with a smile.</t1549> <t1550>“I'm sorry, but I don't think so, Lady Henry.</t1550> <t1551>I never talk while listening to music.</t1551> <t1552>I mean, while listening to good music.</t1552> <t1553>When we hear bad music, it is our duty to drown it out by talking.</t1553><t1554>”</t1554>
<t1555>“Ha, this is one of Harry's views, isn't it, Mr. Gray?</t1555> <t1556>I always hear Harry's views from his friends.</t1556> <t1557>They only reach my ears this way.</t1557> <t1558>Don't think that I don't like good music.</t1558> <t1559>I love it but I also fear it.</t1559> <t1560>It gives me an excessive romanticism.</t1560> <t1561>There have been times when I literally worshipped pianists, sometimes even two pianists at once, according to Harry.</t1561> <t1562>I don't know what it is about pianists.</t1562> <t1563>Maybe it's their foreignness.</t1563> <t1564>They are all foreigners, aren't they?</t1564> <t1565>Even those born in England become foreigners after a while, don't they?</t1565> <t1566>They become very skillful, and this is always the skill of art.</t1566> <t1567>Art gains a cosmopolitan quality in this way...</t1567> <t1568>Mr. Gray, you have never come to my gatherings, have you?</t1568> <t1569>You should come.</t1569> <t1570>I don't have money to buy orchids, but when it comes to gathering foreigners in my salon, I spare no expense.</t1570> <t1571>They add such a picturesque atmosphere to the salons...</t1571> <t1572>Here comes Harry!..</t1572> <t1573>Harry, I was looking for you, I wanted to ask you something but I forgot what it was, and here I found Mr. Gray.</t1573> <t1574>We had such a sweet chat about music.</t1574> <t1575>Our thoughts are almost identical.</t1575> <t1576>No, our thoughts seem quite opposite.</t1576> <t1577>But he is very charming.</t1577> <t1578>I'm so glad we met!</t1578><t1579>”</t1579>
<t1580>Lord Henry raised his crescent-shaped dark eyebrows and, gazing at both with a pleasant smile, said, "I am very glad too, my dear, very glad."</t1580> <t1581>"Dorian, I am so sorry for being late.</t1581> <t1582>I went to Wardour Street to look at an old brocade and had to bargain for hours.</t1582> <t1583>Nowadays people know the price of everything but the value of nothing.</t1583><t1584>"</t1584>
<t1585>Lady Henry broke the tense silence with her abrupt, meaningless laugh, saying, "It's a pity that I have to go!"</t1585> <t1586>"I promised the Duchess to go for a carriage ride.</t1586> <t1587>Goodbye, Mr. Gray.</t1587> <t1588>Goodbye, Harry.</t1588> <t1589>I suppose you are dining out tonight, aren't you?</t1589> <t1590>So am I.</t1590> <t1591>Perhaps we'll meet at Lady Thornbury's.</t1591><t1592>"</t1592>
<t1593>Lord Henry said, "Maybe, my dear," and closed the door behind her.</t1593> <t1594>The woman, with the appearance of a Phoenix that had been in the rain all night, glided out of the room, leaving behind a faint scent of frangipani.</t1594> <t1595>Her husband lit a cigarette and threw himself onto a couch.</t1595> <t1596>After taking a few puffs from his cigarette, he said, "Dorian, never marry a woman with strawberry-colored hair!"</t1596>
<t1597>“Why is that, Harry?”</t1597>
<t1598>“They become very emotional, that's why.</t1598><t1599>”</t1599>
<t1600>“But I love emotional people!</t1600><t1601>”</t1601>
<t1602>“Never marry, Dorian.</t1602> <t1603>Men marry because they are tired, women because they are curious.</t1603> <t1604>Both are disappointed.</t1604><t1605>”</t1605>
<t1606>“I have almost no chance of getting married, Harry.</t1606> <t1607>Because I am in love to the extent that I won't get married.</t1607> <t1608>Here is one of your aphorisms.</t1608> <t1609>Since I never go against your words, I am putting this into practice in my real life.</t1609><t1610>”</t1610>
<t1611>After a pause, Lord Henry asked, "Who are you in love with?"</t1611>
<t1612>Dorian Gray blushingly replied, "To an actress."</t1612>
<t1613>Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders.</t1613> <t1614>"This is a very conventional beginning.</t1614><t1615>"</t1615>
<t1616>"If you saw him, you wouldn't say that, Harry."</t1616><t1617>"</t1617>
<t1618>"Who is this girl?"</t1618>
<t1619>“Her name is Sibyl Vane.</t1619><t1620>”</t1620>
<t1621>“I have never heard of it.</t1621><t1622>”</t1622>
<t1623>“No one has heard.</t1623> <t1624>But when the day comes, everyone will hear.</t1624> <t1625>The girl is very talented.</t1625><t1626>”</t1626>
<t1627>“My dear child, no woman can be a great talent.</t1627> <t1628>Women are a gender created for adornment.</t1628> <t1629>They never have anything to say, but they say it very sweetly.</t1629> <t1630>Women symbolize the triumph of the physical over the mind, just as men symbolize the triumph of the mind over morality.</t1630><t1631>”</t1631>
<t1632>“Harry, how can you talk like that?</t1632><t1633>”</t1633>
<t1634>“Dear Dorian, it is very true, that's why.</t1634> <t1635>These days I am always studying women, so I should know.</t1635> <t1636>The subject is not as obscure as I thought.</t1636> <t1637>Now I see that there are two types of women, colorful and colorless.</t1637> <t1638>Colorless women are very useful.</t1638> <t1639>If you want to be known as honorable and decent, just take one of them out to dinner, that's enough.</t1639> <t1640>The other women are very attractive.</t1640> <t1641>However, they have one single flaw.</t1641> <t1642>They paint themselves in an effort to look young.</t1642> <t1643>Our grandmothers used to paint themselves in an effort to make bright speeches.</t1643> <t1644>Blush and humor went hand in hand in those days.</t1644> <t1645>But now that era is over.</t1645> <t1646>A woman is happy as long as she can look ten years younger than her own daughter.</t1646> <t1647>When it comes to conversation; there are only five women in London worth talking to...</t1647> <t1648>and you can't introduce two of them into your family circle.</t1648> <t1649>Anyway, tell me about your highly talented girl.</t1649><t1650>”</t1650>
<t1651>“Oh, Harry, your ideas terrify me.</t1651><t1652>”</t1652>
<t1653>"Never mind now.</t1653> <t1654>How long have you known him?</t1654><t1655>"</t1655>
<t1656>“It has been about three weeks.</t1656><t1657>”</t1657>
<t1658>"Where did you meet?"</t1658><t1659></t1659>
<t1660>“I will tell you, Harry.</t1660><t1661>Just don't be negative about it.</t1661><t1662>If I hadn't met you, I would never have met him either.</t1662><t1663>You instilled in me a crazy desire to learn everything about living.</t1663><t1664>After meeting you, it felt like my veins were beating like a heart for days.</t1664><t1665>When I lingered in the park, walked down Piccadilly, I looked at everyone passing by, wondering what kind of life they were leading, with a mad curiosity.</t1665><t1666>Some seemed to enchant me, some filled me with horror.</t1666><t1667>There was a delicious poison in the air.</t1667><t1668>I couldn't get enough of the excitement...</t1668><t1669>Anyway, one evening around seven o'clock, I decided to go out and look for an adventure.</t1669><t1670>I felt that London, as you once said; our gray, monstrous London with its disgusting sinners and magnificent sins, surely had something to offer me.</t1670><t1671>I remembered what you told me on that wonderful night when we had our first dinner together: You said that the real secret of life is to pursue beauty.</t1671><t1672>I don't know what I was expecting now.</t1672><t1673>I went out and headed east.</t1673><t1674>Soon I got lost among the intertwined filthy streets and dark, grassless areas.</t1674><t1675>Around half-past eight, I passed in front of a tiny, ridiculous theater.</t1675><t1676>There were huge flaming gas torches and flashy posters at its entrance.</t1676><t1677>A Jew wearing the most astonishing waistcoat I had ever seen was standing at the entrance, puffing on a filthy leaf cigarette.</t1677><t1678>His curly hair was greasy, and a diamond sparkled on the front of his dirty shirt.</t1678><t1679>When he saw me, he took off his hat with magnificent obsequiousness and said, "Would you like a box, my lord?"</t1679><t1680>Harry, there was something about this man that amused me.</t1680><t1681>He was so grotesque!</t1681><t1682>I know you'll mock me, but I went in, paid a full guinea for a first-class box.</t1682><t1683>Why I did it, I still can't figure out today.</t1683><t1684>But if I hadn't gone in...</t1684><t1685>Dear Harry, if I hadn't gone in, I would have missed the greatest love adventure of my life.</t1685><t1686>There, you're laughing.</t1686><t1687>You're so wicked, Harry!</t1687><t1688>”</t1688>
<t1689>“I'm not laughing, Dorian, I mean, I'm not laughing at you.</t1689> <t1690>It's just that you shouldn't say it's the greatest love adventure of my life.</t1690> <t1691>You should say it's the first love adventure of my life.</t1691> <t1692>You will always be loved, you will always live as someone in love with love.</t1692> <t1693>To experience a grande passion is the privilege of those who have nothing to do.</t1693> <t1694>This is the benefit of having idle classes in a country.</t1694> <t1695>Don't be afraid.</t1695> <t1696>Wonderful things await you.</t1696> <t1697>This is just the beginning.</t1697><t1698>”</t1698>
<t1699>Dorian Gray shouted angrily, "Do you think my nature is that shallow?"</t1699>
<t1700>"Yo, I think your creation is just this profound.</t1700><t1701>"</t1701>
<t1702>“What do you mean?</t1702><t1703>”</t1703>
<t1704>“My dear child, those who love only once in their lives are the truly shallow ones.</t1704> <t1705>What they call loyalty and fidelity, I attribute either to the comfort of habit or to the lack of imagination.</t1705> <t1706>For emotional life, loyalty is what consistency is for intellectual life: a simple admission of defeat.</t1706> <t1707>Loyalty! I need to examine this one day.</t1707> <t1708>The passion for possession also plays a part in this.</t1708> <t1709>There are many things we would have discarded long ago if we weren't afraid others would take them.</t1709> <t1710>But I don't want to interrupt your story.</t1710> <t1711>Continue with your narration.</t1711><t1712>”</t1712>
<t1713>“Anyway, I found myself in a terribly small box, with a very mediocre stage curtain right in front of me.</t1713> <t1714>I looked around the hall from behind the curtain of the box.</t1714> <t1715>It was a miserable place.</t1715> <t1716>It was decorated with Cupids and strange things.</t1716> <t1717>It wasn't very full.</t1717> <t1718>Women were walking around selling oranges and drinks, and it seemed like everyone was eating nuts.</t1718><t1719>”</t1719>
<t1720>“The Golden Age of English Theatre, you say.</t1720><t1721>”</t1721>
<t1722>“Probably; it was giving a sense of collapse inside a person.</t1722> <t1723>I was pondering deeply about what to do when my eyes caught the program.</t1723> <t1724>Guess what the play was, Harry?</t1724><t1725>”</t1725>
<t1726>“If you ask me, I would say foolish child or silly and innocent.</t1726> <t1727>Our fathers used to love such games, I believe.</t1727> <t1728>Dorian, with each passing day, I understand a bit more that our fathers didn't know anything better than us.</t1728> <t1729>In politics as in art, les grand-peres ont toujours tort.</t1729> <t1730>Grandfathers are always wrong.</t1730><t1731>”</t1731>
<t1732>“This play was also to our liking, Harry.</t1732> <t1733>It was Romeo and Juliet.</t1733> <t1734>I must admit that the idea of watching Shakespeare in this dingy hole initially irritated me.</t1734> <t1735>Still, I felt a strange interest.</t1735> <t1736>I was determined to at least watch the first act.</t1736> <t1737>There was a terrible orchestra; at the forefront, a young Jew playing a cracked piano.</t1737> <t1738>The music almost drove me away, but finally, the curtain on the stage opened, and the play began.</t1738> <t1739>Romeo was an old man with eyebrows painted with mushroom, a hoarse voice suitable for tragedies, and a build resembling beer barrels.</t1739> <t1740>Mercutio was almost as bad as him.</t1740> <t1741>A very vulgar comedian played this role.</t1741> <t1742>He had sprinkled his own invented lines and was very chummy with the orchestra members.</t1742> <t1743>Both actors were as shapeless as the stage decor, which looked like it was taken from a village fair...</t1743> <t1744>But Juliet!..</t1744> <t1745>Harry, imagine a girl who is barely seventeen, tiny, with a face like a flower, a small head like in ancient Greek paintings, dark chestnut ringlets, eyes like deep purple wells of passion, lips like rose petals.</t1745> <t1746>She was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen in my life.</t1746> <t1747>Once, you told me that touching things didn't affect you, yet that beauty, just that beauty, could even bring tears to your eyes.</t1747> <t1748>Believe me, Harry, I could barely see the girl properly because of the tears in my eyes.</t1748> <t1749>And her voice!</t1749> <t1750>I had never heard such a voice in my life!</t1750> <t1751>At first, it came out very slowly, like deep, soft notes dropping one by one into your ear.</t1751> <t1752>Then, as it rose a bit more, it resembled a flute or the sound of an oboe heard from afar.</t1752> <t1753>In the garden scene, this voice reflected that trembling excitement heard when nightingales sing before dawn.</t1753> <t1754>Later, at times, it resonated with the wild passion of a violin.</t1754> <t1755>You know how voices can affect a person at times.</t1755> <t1756>If there are two things I will never forget in my life, they are your voice and the voice of Sibyl Vane.</t1756> <t1757>When I closed my eyes, I could hear these voices; both were saying different things.</t1757> <t1758>I don't know which one to listen to.</t1758> <t1759>Why shouldn't I love her, Harry? I love her.</t1759> <t1760>She is everything to me in life.</t1760> <t1761>Every night, I go to the theater to watch her.</t1761> <t1762>One night she is Rosalind, the next night Imogen.</t1762> <t1763>I saw her die in the dimness of an Italian cemetery, sucking the poison from her lover's lips.</t1763> <t1764>I saw her wander in the Forest of Arden, dressed as a beautiful young man in long stockings, knee breeches, and an elegant cap.</t1764> <t1765>Once, she went mad, stood before a guilty king, and gave him bitter herbs to taste.</t1765> <t1766>Once, she was innocent, yet the black hands of jealousy squeezed and crushed her swan-like neck.</t1766> <t1767>I have seen her in every guise, in every era.</t1767> <t1768>Ordinary people cannot affect our imagination.</t1768> <t1769>They are limited by their times.</t1769> <t1770>There is no magic to pull them out of their molds.</t1770> <t1771>We know the insides of their heads as well as their hats.</t1771> <t1772>We can easily find them.</t1772> <t1773>There is no mystery in any of them.</t1773> <t1774>They ride horses in the park in the mornings, chatter at tea parties in the afternoons.</t1774> <t1775>Their laughter is clichéd, their behavior is tailored to fashion.</t1775> <t1776>They are easily readable.</t1776> <t1777>But an actress!</t1777> <t1778>A woman who is an actress is so different!</t1778> <t1779>Harry, why didn't you tell me that the only thing worth loving is an actress?</t1779><t1780>”</t1780>
<t1781>“Because I loved so many actresses, Dorian!</t1781><t1782>”</t1782>
<t1783>"Ha, yes, disgusting people with dyed hair and painted faces."</t1783><t1784>"</t1784>
<t1785>“Do not scorn painted hair and painted face,” said Lord Henry.</t1785> <t1786>“Sometimes they can be extraordinarily attractive.</t1786><t1787>”</t1787>
<t1788>"I wish I hadn't told you about Sibyl Vane.</t1788><t1789>"</t1789>
<t1790>“You can't help but tell, Dorian.</t1790> <t1791>You will tell me everything you do for the rest of your life.</t1791><t1792>”</t1792>
<t1793>"Yes, I think it will be so, Harry.</t1793> <t1794>I can't help but tell you everything.</t1794> <t1795>You have a strange effect on me.</t1795> <t1796>Even if I committed a serious crime one day, I would come and confess to you.</t1796> <t1797>You would understand me.</t1797><t1798>"</t1798>
<t1799>“People like you – the sunbeams of life – do not commit serious crimes, Dorian.</t1799> <t1800>Nevertheless, thank you very much for the compliment.</t1800> <t1801>Now tell me...</t1801> <t1802>Would you be so kind as to pass the match?</t1802> <t1803>Thank you...</t1803> <t1804>What is the nature of your relationship with Sibyl Vane?</t1804><t1805>”</t1805>
<t1806>Dorian Gray blushed, his eyes blazing with anger as he jumped to his feet.</t1806> <t1807>"Harry! Sibyl Vane is sacred!</t1807><t1808>"</t1808>
<t1809>Lord Henry said, "Only sacred things are worth touching."</t1809> <t1810>There was a strange sadness in his voice.</t1810> <t1811>"Why are you angry?</t1811> <t1812>Surely the girl will be yours one day.</t1812> <t1813>When a person falls in love, they always start by deceiving themselves and end by deceiving others.</t1813> <t1814>This is what our world calls romance...</t1814> <t1815>I suppose you have at least met her, haven't you?</t1815><t1816>"</t1816>
<t1817>“Of course I did.</t1817> <t1818>The first night I went to the theater, that old Jew came to my box at the end of the play and suggested taking me backstage to introduce me to her.</t1818> <t1819>I was very angry with him.</t1819> <t1820>I said, Juliet has been dead for hundreds of years, lying in a marble tomb in Verona.</t1820> <t1821>From the bewildered look on his face, I understood that he thought I had had too much champagne.</t1821><t1822>”</t1822>
<t1823>“I never waver.</t1823><t1824>”</t1824>
<t1825>“Then he asked me if I was a journalist.</t1825> <t1826>I told him that I didn't read newspapers.</t1826> <t1827>When he heard this, he was very disappointed, obviously.</t1827> <t1828>He told me that all theater critics were conspiring against him, and that they were all, without exception, for sale.</t1828><t1829>”</t1829>
<t1830>“If he is right in what he says, I wouldn't be surprised.</t1830> <t1831>But on the other hand, if you look at most of their appearances, they shouldn't be very expensive.</t1831><t1832>”</t1832>
<t1833>Dorian laughed, "I don't know, I think he found those critics too expensive for his own pocket."</t1833> <t1834>"By the way, I left because the theater's lights were starting to be turned off.</t1834> <t1835>The Jew wanted to offer me a leaf cigarette, he strongly recommended this brand.</t1835> <t1836>I didn't take it.</t1836> <t1837>But the next night I returned there, naturally.</t1837> <t1838>When the Jew saw me, he bowed down to the ground and said that I was a generous patron of the arts.</t1838> <t1839>He was truly an annoying fellow, but he had an unprecedented passion for Shakespeare.</t1839> <t1840>Once, he proudly told me that he had gone bankrupt five times, and all five bankruptcies were because of Shakespeare.</t1840> <t1841>He seemed to view this as a privilege.</t1841><t1842>"</t1842>
<t1843>“It is a privilege, dear Dorian, a great privilege.</t1843> <t1844>Most people go bankrupt because they invest too much in the prose of life.</t1844> <t1845>To go bankrupt because of poetry is an honor...</t1845> <t1846>But when did you first speak to Miss Sibyl Vane?</t1846><t1847>”</t1847>
<t1848>“The third night.</t1848> <t1849>She was playing Rosalind.</t1849> <t1850>I couldn't stop myself from going backstage.</t1850> <t1851>I had thrown her a few flowers, and she had looked at me, or rather, it seemed to me that she had looked.</t1851> <t1852>The old Jew kept insisting.</t1852> <t1853>He was determined to take me backstage, and I yielded.</t1853> <t1854>Wasn't it strange that I didn't want to meet this girl, don't you think?</t1854><t1855>”</t1855>
<t1856>“No, I don't think so.</t1856><t1857>”</t1857>
<t1858>“Dear Harry, but why?</t1858><t1859>”</t1859>
<t1860>“I'll tell you another time.</t1860> <t1861>Now I want to learn about this girl.</t1861><t1862>”</t1862>
<t1863>“Sibyl, my dear?</t1863> <t1864>Ah, she is so shy, so gentle!</t1864> <t1865>She already has a childlike air about her.</t1865> <t1866>When I told her how much I liked her performance, her eyes opened wide with a delightful disbelief and pleasure.</t1866> <t1867>She seemed unaware of the power of her influence.</t1867> <t1868>I think we were both feeling a bit awkward.</t1868> <t1869>The old Jew stood at the door of that dusty dressing room, grinning from ear to ear, while he showered us with grandiose words, and we stood there like two children, looking at each other.</t1869> <t1870>The man kept insisting on calling me ‘My Lord.’</t1870> <t1871>So I had to tell Sibyl that I wasn’t a lord at all.</t1871> <t1872>And with a completely unaffected simplicity, she said, ‘You look more like a prince than a lord; it would be fitting to call you Sweet Prince.’</t1872><t1873>”</t1873>
<t1874>"My goodness, Dorian, Miss Sibyl knows how to compliment."</t1874><t1875>"</t1875>
<t1876>“You can't understand him, Harry.</t1876> <t1877>He only saw me as a character in a play.</t1877> <t1878>He doesn't know life at all!</t1878> <t1879>He lives with his mother.</t1879> <t1880>His mother is an elderly, tired woman.</t1880> <t1881>The first night I went, she played Lady Capulet in a kimono-like purple garment.</t1881> <t1882>She seems to have been well-off but has now fallen on hard times.</t1882><t1883>”</t1883>
<t1884>Lord Henry, examining the rings on his fingers, murmured, "I know those types, they bore me."</t1884>
<t1885>“The Jew wanted to tell me his life story, but I said, I'm not interested.</t1885><t1886>”</t1886>
<t1887>“You did the right thing.</t1887> <t1888>There is always something extremely ugly and bitter in the tragedies of others.</t1888><t1889>”</t1889>
<t1890>“The only thing I care about is Sibyl.</t1890> <t1891>I don't care about her lineage or background.</t1891> <t1892>From her tiny head to her tiny feet, she is entirely, utterly a marvelous creature.</t1892> <t1893>Every night of the week, I go to watch her on stage, and every night I find her more wonderful.</t1893><t1894>”</t1894>
<t1895>“I suppose this is why you haven't been going out to eat with me lately.</t1895> <t1896>I had a feeling you were having an interesting romantic adventure.</t1896> <t1897>Indeed, it turned out to be true, but this adventure was different from what I had imagined.</t1897><t1898>”</t1898>
<t1899>“Dear Harry, we have lunch or dinner together almost every day, and I have come to the opera with you many times,” Dorian Gray replied, opening his blue eyes in astonishment.</t1899>
<t1900>“You are always terribly late.</t1900><t1901>”</t1901>
<t1902>The young man shouted, "What should I do!"</t1902> <t1903>"I can't help but go to see Sibyl's play, even if it's just for a single act!</t1903> <t1904>I feel like I'm starving to see her.</t1904> <t1905>Especially when I think about the marvelous soul hidden in that ivory body, I feel a sense of awe.</t1905><t1906>"</t1906>
<t1907>“You will come to dinner with me tonight, won't you, Dorian?</t1907><t1908>”</t1908>
<t1909>Dorian nodded his head.</t1909> <t1910>"Tonight Sibyl is Imogen," he replied.</t1910> <t1911>"Tomorrow night she is Juliet.</t1911><t1912>"</t1912>
<t1913>“When do I become Sibyl Vane?</t1913><t1914>”</t1914>
<t1915>“Never.</t1915><t1916>”</t1916>
<t1917>“Congratulations to you.</t1917><t1918>”</t1918>
<t1919>“How disgusting you are, Harry! Sibyl is the combination of all the great female heroines of the world.</t1919> <t1920>She is something beyond the individual.</t1920> <t1921>You laugh, but I'm telling you, she is a great talent.</t1921> <t1922>I love her, and I must make her love me too.</t1922> <t1923>You, who know all the secrets of life, tell me, what spell should I cast to make Sibyl Vane love me?</t1923> <t1924>I want to make Romeo jealous.</t1924> <t1925>I want the dead lovers of history to hear our laughter and feel sorrow.</t1925> <t1926>I want a breath of our fire to give life to their soil, to awaken their ashes and make them suffer.</t1926> <t1927>My God, if you only knew how I worship her, Harry!</t1927><t1928>”</t1928>
<t1929>Dorian was pacing back and forth in the room while talking.</t1929> <t1930>Red spots, like the fever of a fever, were burning on his cheeks.</t1930> <t1931>The young man was extremely excited.</t1931>
<t1932>Lord Henry was watching him with a secret pleasure.</t1932> <t1933>How different this Dorian was from the shy, timid boy he had seen in Basil Hallward's studio!</t1933> <t1934>His personality had blossomed like a flower, with crimson flame buds.</t1934> <t1935>His soul had emerged from its hidden place, and desire had met it halfway.</t1935>
<t1936>Lord Henry asked finally, "Well, what do you plan to do?"</t1936>
<t1937>“Come one night with Basil, see his play, I want you to.</t1937> <t1938>I have no fear at all of the outcome.</t1938> <t1939>You will acknowledge his superior talent, this is certain.</t1939> <t1940>Then I must save him from that Jew’s hands.</t1940> <t1941>He is bound to him by a three-year contract, which means two years and eight months from today.</t1941> <t1942>I will have to pay the Jew something, naturally.</t1942> <t1943>Once these things are settled, I will rent a theater in West End and properly introduce Sibyl.</t1943> <t1944>She will enchant the whole world, just as she has enchanted me.</t1944><t1945>”</t1945>
<t1946>“This is unbelievable, my dear.</t1946><t1947>”</t1947>
<t1948>“Yes, she will enchant.</t1948> <t1949>What Sibyl has is not only artistic talent, a perfect artistic instinct, but also personality.</t1949> <t1950>You have told me many times that it is not principles but personalities that influence the age.</t1950><t1951>”</t1951>
<t1952>“So, which night are we going?</t1952><t1953>”</t1953>
<t1954>“Wait a minute.</t1954> <t1955>Today is Tuesday.</t1955> <t1956>Let's say tomorrow.</t1956> <t1957>Sibyl is playing Juliet tomorrow.</t1957><t1958>”</t1958>
<t1959>“Okay.</t1959> <t1960>At eight o'clock in Bristol.</t1960> <t1961>I'll pick up Basil.</t1961><t1962>”</t1962>
<t1963>“Not eight, Harry, please, six-thirty.</t1963> <t1964>I must be there before the curtain rises.</t1964> <t1965>You have to see her in the first act, when she meets Romeo.</t1965><t1966>”</t1966>
<t1967>“Half past six, ha!</t1967> <t1968>What a strange hour!</t1968> <t1969>It's like drinking broth instead of tea or reading an English novel.</t1969> <t1970>Let's make it seven.</t1970> <t1971>No gentleman dines before seven.</t1971> <t1972>Will you see Basil in the meantime, or should I write a note?</t1972><t1973>”</t1973>
<t1974>"Dear Basil! It has been a week since I last saw him.</t1974> <t1975>It was very rude of me because he sent me my portrait, in a wonderful frame that he designed himself.</t1975> <t1976>Although I am jealous because he is a month younger than me, I must admit that I love this portrait.</t1976> <t1977>Maybe it would be better if you wrote.</t1977> <t1978>I don't want to be alone with him.</t1978> <t1979>He always says things that irritate me: He gives me very appropriate advice.</t1979><t1980>"</t1980>
<t1981>Lord Henry smiled.</t1981> <t1982>“People love to get rid of the things they need.</t1982> <t1983>I call it the height of generosity.</t1983><t1984>”</t1984>
<t1985>“No, Basil is a really good man, but he seems a bit unrefined to me.</t1985> <t1986>After getting to know you, I realized this, Harry.</t1986><t1987>”</t1987>
<t1988>“Dear child, Basil channels all the charming aspects of his personality into his work.</t1988> <t1989>As a result, all that remains for his life are his prejudices, principles, and common sense.</t1989> <t1990>Among the artists I know, those who are charming in everyday life are only the bad artists.</t1990> <t1991>Good artists exist solely in their works, and as a result, their personalities remain dull.</t1991> <t1992>The great poet, the truly great poet, is the one who is the furthest from poetry among all creatures.</t1992> <t1993>However, third and fourth-rate poets are interesting.</t1993> <t1994>The worse their poetry, the more striking their appearance.</t1994> <t1995>Having published a second-rate sonnet book is enough to make a person utterly unbearable.</t1995> <t1996>This man lives the poetry he cannot write.</t1996> <t1997>The others, the real poets, write as poetry what they dare not achieve in life.</t1997><t1998>”</t1998>
<t1999>Dorian, "I don't know, Harry, is it really like that?" he said, applying some perfume from the large bottle with the golden stopper onto his handkerchief.</t1999> <t2000>"It must be, since you say so.</t2000> <t2001>Now I am leaving.</t2001> <t2002>Imogen is waiting.</t2002> <t2003>Don't forget about tomorrow, okay? Goodbye.</t2003><t2004>"</t2004>
<t2005>When Dorian went out, Lord Henry closed his heavy eyelids and began to ponder.</t2005> <t2006>The fact was that there were very few people who interested him as much as Dorian Gray did.</t2006> <t2007>Yet, the young lord felt not the slightest jealousy or annoyance that the boy was madly infatuated with someone else.</t2007> <t2008>On the contrary, he found it pleasing.</t2008> <t2009>This passion made Dorian Gray more interesting, more worthy of study.</t2009> <t2010>Lord Henry had always harbored a deep curiosity about the natural sciences, though he found their ordinary subjects trivial and insignificant.</t2010> <t2011>Thus, he began by examining himself under the microscope, eventually turning to dissect and study others.</t2011> <t2012>Human life: this was the only thing worth examining in Lord Henry's eyes.</t2012> <t2013>Nothing could be as valuable.</t2013> <t2014>Indeed, while the observer watched life in the test tube filled with a mixture of pains and joys, he could not wear a glass mask, nor could he prevent the poisonous vapors from affecting his brain, causing his imagination to throb with strange fantasies and shapeless dreams.</t2014> <t2015>There were such insidious poisons that one had to be poisoned by them to discern their qualities.</t2015> <t2016>Yet, in the end, how magnificent a reward this examination gave to a person!</t2016> <t2017>How marvelous the world became in one's eyes!</t2017> <t2018>To notice the strange, rigid logic of passion and the experiences of the mind tinged with sentimentality, to observe where these two converged, where they diverged, where they reconciled, and where they clashed...</t2018> <t2019>What a great delight was hidden in this!</t2019> <t2020>Who cared about the cost?</t2020> <t2021>No excitement's price was too high.</t2021>
<t2022>Lord Henry was aware –and knowing this gave a gleam of pleasure to his agate-colored eyes– that because of some words he had said, words spoken in a melodious voice, Dorian Gray's soul had turned towards this lily-like girl, had bowed before her.</t2022> <t2023>The boy was largely his creation.</t2023> <t2024>Lord Henry had developed him early.</t2024> <t2025>That was something.</t2025> <t2026>Ordinary people waited for life to reveal its secrets to them.</t2026> <t2027>However, to a handful of select individuals, life's secrets were revealed before the curtain even rose.</t2027> <t2028>Sometimes this happened under the influence of art, especially literature; because literature deals directly with passions and the mind.</t2028> <t2029>Sometimes a complex personality would take the place of art, assuming its role, in short, becoming a true work of art in its own right.</t2029> <t2030>Life, just like poetry, sculpture, and painting, has its meticulously created masterpieces.</t2030>
<t2031>Yes, the young man had matured ahead of his time.</t2031> <t2032>He was reaping his harvest in the spring.</t2032> <t2033>He was filled with the speed and fire of youth and was beginning to become aware of his own existence.</t2033> <t2034>It was a great pleasure to observe him.</t2034> <t2035>That beautiful face, with his beautiful soul, the young man was truly something unbelievable.</t2035> <t2036>Who cares how the end will come, or what is written on his forehead?</t2036> <t2037>He resembled characters from a stage play, from a carnival: You know, their joys seem distant from us, their sorrows caress our sense of beauty, and their wounds bleed like red roses.</t2037>
<t2038>Spirit and body, body and spirit: How mysterious they were!</t2038> <t2039>The spirit could become animalistic, and the body could at times become spirit.</t2039> <t2040>What the emotions exalted, the mind could disdain.</t2040> <t2041>Who could know where the physical impulse ended and the bodily impulse began?</t2041> <t2042>How shallow were the haphazard definitions of ordinary psychologists!</t2042> <t2043>On the other hand, how difficult it was to choose among the claims of various psychological schools!</t2043> <t2044>Was the spirit a shadow residing within the house of sin?</t2044> <t2045>Or was the body actually within the spirit, as Giardano Bruno thought?</t2045> <t2046>The separation of the spirit from matter was a mystery, just as the union of the spirit with matter was a mystery.</t2046>
<t2047>Lord Henry had begun to wonder: Was it within our power to turn psychology into an absolutely precise and definitive science, thereby ensuring that even the smallest springs of life were laid bare?</t2047> <t2048>In that case, we were always misunderstanding ourselves and rarely understanding others.</t2048> <t2049>What was called experience had no ethical value.</t2049> <t2050>It was merely a name people gave to their mistakes.</t2050> <t2051>Moralists generally considered it a kind of warning, claimed it had an ethical benefit in the development of personality, and boasted that it was a sign of what to follow and what to avoid.</t2051> <t2052>However, there was no driving force in experience.</t2052> <t2053>The active role it played was as insignificant as the role of conscience.</t2053> <t2054>The only truth it revealed was that our future would be equal to our past; we would commit the sin we once committed with disgust many times in the future, and this time with pleasure.</t2054>
<t2055>Lord Henry could clearly see that the only way to lead a person to the scientific examination of passions was the experimental method.</t2055><t2056>Dorian Gray was indeed a perfect subject for him, promising bright and fruitful results.</t2056><t2057>This sudden mad passion he had developed for Sibyl Vane was an extraordinary psychological event, not to be underestimated in its peculiarity.</t2057><t2058>There was no doubt that curiosity played a major role in this, curiosity and the desire for novelty.</t2058><t2059>Yet it was not a simple passion; it was very complex.</t2059><t2060>The lustful impulse derived from youth, altered by the influence of imagination, had transformed into a feeling that seemed far from logic and common sense to the boy himself, and thus all the more dangerous.</t2060><t2061>It was the passions about whose origins we deceived ourselves that exerted the most relentless pressures on us.</t2061><t2062>Our weakest impulses were those whose nature we knew.</t2062><t2063>Often, when we thought we were experimenting on others, we were actually experimenting on ourselves.</t2063>
<t2064>While Lord Henry sat lost in these thoughts, there was a knock at the door, and his personal servant entered to inform him that it was time to dress for dinner.</t2064> <t2065>Lord Henry stood up and looked out the window at the street.</t2065> <t2066>The sunset had turned the upper floor windows of the houses across the street into crimson gold.</t2066> <t2067>The panes glowed like sheets of heated metal.</t2067> <t2068>Above, the sky resembled a faded rose.</t2068> <t2069>Lord Henry thought of his friend's fresh, fiery life and wondered what the outcome of all this would be.</t2069>
<t2070>When he returned home around half-past six, he found a telegram on the table in the hall.</t2070> <t2071>When he opened it, he realized it was from Dorian Gray.</t2071> <t2072>The telegram was informing that Dorian Gray had gotten engaged to marry Sibyl Vane.</t2072>
<t2073>Fifth chapter</t2073>
<t2074>The girl whispered, "Mom, mommy, I am so happy!" as she buried her head in the lap of the tired, elderly-looking woman.</t2074> <t2075>The woman, with her back turned to the harsh, glaring light, was sitting in the only chair in that shabby room.</t2075> <t2076>The girl said, "I am so happy that you must be happy too!"</t2076>
<t2077>Ms. Vane shuddered slightly and placed her thin, bismuth-whitened hands on her daughter's head.</t2077> <t2078>"Did you say happy, Sibyl! I am only happy when I see you on stage.</t2078> <t2079>You should think of nothing but your profession.</t2079> <t2080>Mr. Isaacs has done us many favors.</t2080> <t2081>We owe him money.</t2081><t2082>"</t2082>
<t2083>The girl lifted her head and looked at her mother, pouting her lip.</t2083> <t2084>"Did you say money, mom?" she retorted.</t2084>
<t2085>“Why should we care about money?</t2085> <t2086>Love is superior to money.</t2086><t2087>”</t2087>
<t2088>“Let's pay our debts.</t2088> <t2089>Mr. Isaacs gave us fifty pounds so that we could also properly dress James.</t2089> <t2090>You must not forget this, Sibyl.</t2090> <t2091>Fifty pounds is a lot of money.</t2091> <t2092>Mr. Isaacs did us a great favor.</t2092><t2093>”</t2093>
<t2094>“Mr. Isaacs is not a gentleman, mother,” said the girl as she stood up and walked to the window.</t2094> <t2095>“I hate the way he talks to me.</t2095><t2096>”</t2096>
<t2097>Her mother, grumbling, said, "I don't know what we would do without him."</t2097> <t2098>Sibyl shook her head and laughed.</t2098> <t2099>"We don't need him anymore, mother.</t2099> <t2100>Now we have the Sweet Prince with us." Sibyl paused.</t2100> <t2101>Her cheeks blushed as if a rose had been tossed in her blood.</t2101> <t2102>Her lips parted, trembling, as her breath caught.</t2102> <t2103>A warm breeze of passion swirled around the delicate folds of her dress.</t2103> <t2104>Sibyl said simply, "I love him."</t2104>
<t2105>The response he received was a parrot-like repetition, "Stupid child!</t2105> <t2106>Stupid child!"</t2106> <t2107>The waving of the crooked fingers adorned with fake gemstone rings added an extra layer of oddity to the words.</t2107>
<t2108>The girl laughed again.</t2108> <t2109>There was the joy of a bird trapped in a cage in her voice.</t2109> <t2110>Her eyes also captured this melody and seemed to reflect it in the form of a sparkle, then closed for a moment as if to hide the secret within them.</t2110> <t2111>When they reopened, it was as if a mist of a dream had passed through them.</t2111>
<t2112>The cautious mind was raising its voice from that worn-out armchair, touching on the necessity of being careful, and quoting from the famous "cowardice" book that its author admired in the name of "common sense."</t2112> <t2113>The girl wasn't even listening to it.</t2113> <t2114>She was free within the prison of her passion.</t2114> <t2115>Her own fairy tale prince, Sweet Prince, was now right beside her.</t2115> <t2116>Sibyl had turned to memory so that it could bring her prince to life beside her.</t2116> <t2117>And memory had brought the prince to her.</t2117> <t2118>The prince's kiss was burning the young girl's lips again.</t2118> <t2119>His breath was warm on the girl's eyelids.</t2119>
<t2120>Then the mind changed its method; it spoke of "probing" and "learning and understanding."</t2120> <t2121>This young man could be wealthy.</t2121> <t2122>If so, marriage should be considered.</t2122> <t2123>Waves of cunning began to crash upon the pearl of the girl's ear; arrows of deceit pierced her heart.</t2123> <t2124>The girl saw those thin lips moving and smiled.</t2124>
<t2125>Suddenly, he felt the need to speak.</t2125> <t2126>This silence full of words was making him uneasy.</t2126>
<t2127>“Mom, mom!” she said.</t2127> <t2128>“Why does this child love me so much?</t2128> <t2129>I know why I love him.</t2129> <t2130>I love him because he is like a living symbol of love itself.</t2130> <t2131>But what does he see in me?</t2131> <t2132>I am not worthy of him.</t2132> <t2133>Still...</t2133> <t2134>I don't know why... I feel that I am far below him, but I don't feel crushed.</t2134> <t2135>I feel proud, incredibly proud.</t2135> <t2136>Mom, did you love my father like this, the way I love my Sweet Prince?</t2136><t2137>”</t2137>
<t2138>Anne turned pale under the thick layer of powder smeared on her cheeks, a nerve twitched on her dry lips.</t2138> <t2139>Sibyl ran up to her, hugged her, and kissed her.</t2139>
<t2140>“Forgive me, my dear mother.</t2140> <t2141>I know talking about my father upsets you.</t2141> <t2142>But if you are so upset, it is because you once loved him very much.</t2142> <t2143>Don't look so sad.</t2143> <t2144>Just as you were happy twenty years ago, I am happy today.</t2144> <t2145>Oh, please, let me be happy for a lifetime!</t2145><t2146>”</t2146>
<t2147>“My dear child, you are still very young, you are not at the age to think about falling in love.</t2147> <t2148>Besides, what do you know about this young man?</t2148> <t2149>You don't even know his name.</t2149> <t2150>From any angle, it’s a very inappropriate situation, very untimely.</t2150> <t2151>At a time when I have a world of problems to think about, especially with James going to Australia, I would have expected a bit more understanding from you, honestly.</t2151> <t2152>Anyway, as I said, if this boy is wealthy...</t2152><t2153>”</t2153>
<t2154>“Mom, dear mom, please, let me be happy!</t2154><t2155>”</t2155>
<t2156>Ms. Vane looked at her daughter, then embraced her with one of those artificial gestures that become a second nature to actors and pressed her to her chest.</t2156> <t2157>At that very moment, the door opened and a young man with disheveled chestnut hair entered the room.</t2157> <t2158>He was stocky, with large hands and feet, and his movements were somewhat awkward.</t2158> <t2159>He lacked his sister's grace.</t2159> <t2160>One could never guess the close blood relation between them.</t2160> <t2161>Ms. Vane fixed her eyes on him, the smile on her lips widened.</t2161> <t2162>In her mind, she had elevated her son to the level of an "audience."</t2162> <t2163>She had no doubt about the interesting nature of the "scene" she had created.</t2163>
<t2164>The young man said with a tender growl, "Sibyl, you can save some of your kisses for me too."</t2164>
<t2165>Sibyl said, "But you don't like to be kissed, Jim!"</t2165> <t2166>“You know how to grumble like a bear!” she said, running up to him and hugging him tightly.</t2166>
<t2167>James Vane looked at his sister's face with love.</t2167> <t2168>“I want you to come for a walk with me, Sibyl.</t2168> <t2169>I don't think I will see this dreadful city called London again.</t2169> <t2170>Nor do I want to see it.</t2170><t2171>”</t2171>
<t2172>Ms. Vane murmured, "My son, don't say such things!"</t2172> <t2173>Sighing, she picked up an old, shabby, cheap stage costume and began to mend it.</t2173> <t2174>She was a bit disappointed that her son hadn't joined them.</t2174> <t2175>Had James joined them, a more striking scene would have emerged.</t2175>
<t2176>"Why shouldn't I say it, mom?</t2176> <t2177>I'm speaking sincerely.</t2177><t2178>"</t2178>
<t2179>"You are upsetting me, my son.</t2179> <t2180>I believe that you will return from Australia as a wealthy and reputable man.</t2180> <t2181>I do not believe that there is such a thing as society in the colonies, at least not anything I would call society.</t2181> <t2182>Therefore, after you have made your fortune there, you must return here and make your mark in London.</t2182><t2183>"</t2183>
<t2184>The child muttered, “High society!”</t2184> <t2185>“I don't want to get involved with that at all.</t2185> <t2186>What I want is to make some money and take you and Sibyl away from the stage.</t2186> <t2187>I hate the stage life.</t2187><t2188>”</t2188>
<t2189>Sibyl laughed, "Aman Jim, how cruel you are!"</t2189> <t2190>"Really, do you want to go for a walk with me?</t2190> <t2191>How nice.</t2191> <t2192>I thought you would be saying goodbye to your own friends: Tom Hardy, who gave you that dreadful pipe, and Ned Langton, who mocks you for smoking it.</t2192> <t2193>It's so sweet of you to spend your last afternoon with me.</t2193> <t2194>Where shall we go?</t2194> <t2195>Let's go to the park.</t2195><t2196>"</t2196>
<t2197>His brother frowned and said, "I look so shabby."</t2197> <t2198>"Only high society people go to the park.</t2198><t2199>"</t2199>
<t2200>Sibyl, stroking the sleeve of his coat, said, "You're talking nonsense."</t2200>
<t2201>James paused for a moment.</t2201> <t2202>Finally, he said, "Alright."</t2202> <t2203>"But don't take too long getting dressed up.</t2203><t2204>"</t2204>
<t2205>Sibyl exited the room as if dancing.</t2205> <t2206>They heard her singing upstairs.</t2206> <t2207>Her little feet were pattering on the ceiling.</t2207>
<t2208>James paced back and forth in the room.</t2208> <t2209>Then he turned to the woman sitting motionless on the couch.</t2209> <t2210>“Mom, are my things ready?” he asked.</t2210>
<t2211>The woman replied, "Everything is ready, James," without lifting her eyes from her work.</t2211> <t2212>In recent months, being alone with her straightforward, serious son had become a source of discomfort for her.</t2212> <t2213>Whenever their eyes met, her sly, shallow soul grew uneasy, wondering if her son suspected anything.</t2213> <t2214>Since her son did not say anything else, she could no longer bear the silence.</t2214> <t2215>She began to complain.</t2215> <t2216>Women defend themselves through attacks, and sometimes, they launch attacks through sudden, inexplicable surrenders.</t2216> <t2217>Ms. Vane said, "James, I hope the seafaring life gives you satisfaction."</t2217> <t2218>"You must never forget that you chose this yourself.</t2218> <t2219>You could have joined a lawyer's office.</t2219> <t2220>The legal profession is very respectable.</t2220> <t2221>Especially those in the countryside are often invited to dine with the best families.</t2221><t2222>"</t2222>
<t2223>His son replied to his mother, "I hate offices and clerks."</t2223> <t2224>"All I want to tell you is to keep an eye on Sibyl.</t2224> <t2225>Don't let any harm come to her.</t2225> <t2226>You must take care of her as if she were your own eyes, mother.</t2226><t2227>"</t2227>
<t2228>“James, you are talking very strangely.</t2228> <t2229>Am I not looking after Sibyl?</t2229><t2230>”</t2230>
<t2231>“I heard that a gentleman comes to the theater every evening and goes backstage to talk to you.</t2231> <t2232>Is there any truth to this?</t2232> <t2233>What do you say about this?</t2233><t2234>”</t2234>
<t2235>“James, you are talking about things you don't understand.</t2235> <t2236>In this profession, we attract a lot of attention, our pride swells.</t2236> <t2237>There was a time when I used to receive bunches of flowers.</t2237> <t2238>People truly appreciated theater acting.</t2238> <t2239>As for Sibyl; I don't know if she has a serious commitment at the moment.</t2239> <t2240>But it is undeniable that the mentioned young man is a perfect gentleman.</t2240> <t2241>He always treats me with utmost respect.</t2241> <t2242>And he seems to be wealthy from his appearance.</t2242> <t2243>The flowers he sends are very beautiful.</t2243><t2244>”</t2244>
<t2245>The young man said harshly, "But you don't know her name."</t2245>
<t2246>With a serene expression on her face, his mother said, "No."</t2246> <t2247>"He hasn't revealed his name yet.</t2247> <t2248>I think it's quite a romantic thing.</t2248> <t2249>He must be someone from the aristocracy.</t2249><t2250>"</t2250>
<t2251>James Vane bit his lip.</t2251> <t2252>Then, he said again, "Look after Sibyl, mother."</t2252> <t2253>"Protect her with your life!</t2253><t2254>"</t2254>
<t2255>“My son, you are darkening my heart.</t2255> <t2256>I have always looked after Sibyl like the apple of my eye.</t2256> <t2257>If this gentleman is wealthy, there is no reason why Sibyl should not enter into a relationship with him.</t2257> <t2258>I believe he is an aristocrat.</t2258> <t2259>He completely looks the part, believe me.</t2259> <t2260>Thus, Sibyl can make a dazzling marriage.</t2260> <t2261>What a beautiful couple they would make: The boy is extraordinarily handsome.</t2261> <t2262>He attracts everyone's attention.</t2262><t2263>”</t2263>
<t2264>The young man, muttering something to himself, tapped on the windowpane with his blunt fingers as if playing a drum.</t2264> <t2265>Just as he was about to say something, the door opened, and Sibyl ran inside.</t2265>
<t2266>“How serious you both are!” he said.</t2266> <t2267>“What's wrong with you?</t2267><t2268>”</t2268>
<t2269>James Vane, "Nothing," he replied.</t2269> <t2270>"Can't a person be serious once in a while?</t2270> <t2271>Goodbye, mother.</t2271> <t2272>I will have dinner at five o'clock.</t2272> <t2273>I've packed everything in my suitcase except for my shirts, don't worry about it.</t2273><t2274>"</t2274>
<t2275>The woman, saying "Goodbye, my son," made a gesture as if to bow with a cold and formal demeanor.</t2275>
<t2276>She was angry at the tone of voice her son used when speaking to her.</t2276> <t2277>There was something in the young man's gaze that instilled fear in his mother.</t2277>
<t2278>Sibyl said, "Mommy, kiss me."</t2278> <t2279>Her bud-like lips touched the woman's faded cheeks, taking away the chill from them.</t2279>
<t2280>Ms. Vane, "My dear!</t2280> <t2281>My dear!" she cried softly and lifted her eyes to the ceiling as if looking at the balcony of a theater.</t2281>
<t2282>James said impatiently, "Come on, Sibyl."</t2282> <t2283>He hated his mother's affectations and pretentious behavior.</t2283>
<t2284>They stepped into the sunlight that flickered and turned with the wind, and began to walk down the dreary Euston Street.</t2284> <t2285>Passersby were giving strange looks to the hulking, sullen young man walking beside such an elegant, polite girl, with his coarse, shapeless clothes.</t2285> <t2286>It was like an ordinary gardener walking arm in arm with a rose.</t2286>
<t2287>James would frown whenever he caught the curious gaze of a stranger.</t2287> <t2288>He never liked being looked at; this is something that comes to geniuses in their later years, but never leaves ordinary people alone.</t2288> <t2289>However, Sibyl was completely unaware of the effect she had on those around her.</t2289> <t2290>The love in her heart trembled on her lips as laughter.</t2290> <t2291>The young girl was thinking about her Sweet Prince.</t2291> <t2292>To think of him more comfortably, she never spoke of him, instead chattering about the ship James would board, the gold he would surely find at his destination, and the rich and magnificent girl he would rescue from the hands of bad natives.</t2292> <t2293>Because Jim was not going to remain a sailor.</t2293> <t2294>No way!</t2294> <t2295>The life of sailors was terrible.</t2295> <t2296>Just think, you're stuck on a filthy ship, outside the roaring, humped waves are trying to break in, a pitch-black wind is toppling the masts and tearing the sails into long, screaming strips!</t2296> <t2297>No, when James arrived in Melbourne, he would leave the ship, bid the captain a polite farewell, and then head straight for the gold mines.</t2297> <t2298>Within a week, he would find a huge, pure gold nugget, the largest nugget ever found, and he would bring it to the shore in a closed carriage protected by six mounted policemen.</t2298> <t2299>The natives would attack them three times and be repelled with great bloodshed.</t2299> <t2300>But no, James would not go to the gold mines either.</t2300> <t2301>Those were disgusting places where men got drunk and shot each other in bars, using foul language.</t2301> <t2302>James would run a sensible and well-behaved sheep farm.</t2302> <t2303>One evening, while returning home on horseback, he would see that beautiful, rich girl being kidnapped by a bandit on a black horse, and he would immediately chase after them and rescue the girl.</t2303> <t2304>Of course, the girl would fall in love with him, and he with her; they would get married, then return here and live in a huge house in London.</t2304> <t2305>Yes, very beautiful things awaited James.</t2305> <t2306>However, at the beginning, he had to behave very well; he should not get angry or squander his money.</t2306> <t2307>Sibyl was only a year older than him, yet she knew life much better.</t2307> <t2308>Then James had to write to her with every mail, and say his prayers every night before bed.</t2308> <t2309>God was very kind-hearted and would surely watch over him.</t2309> <t2310>Sibyl would also pray for him and a few years later, James would return very rich and happy.</t2310>
<t2311>James was listening with a sullen face, not responding.</t2311> <t2312>His heart was aching because he was going to leave his home and homeland.</t2312>
<t2313>It wasn't just this that made him so joyless and sullen.</t2313> <t2314>Although still inexperienced, he was aware of the danger Sibyl was in.</t2314> <t2315>The young society dandy chasing after Sibyl couldn't have good intentions.</t2315> <t2316>He was a polite gentleman, and James resented him for this, harboring a strange instinctive grudge that he didn't fully understand, which made him feel it more intensely.</t2316> <t2317>The young man was also aware of the shallowness and arrogance in his mother's nature; he saw great danger in this for Sibyl, for Sibyl's happiness.</t2317> <t2318>Children initially love their parents, as they grow, they judge them, and sometimes they forgive them.</t2318>
<t2319>Mother! There was something James wanted to ask his mother, something that had been quietly bothering him for months.</t2319> <t2320>A few words overheard in the theater, a few mocking remarks he heard while waiting at the backstage door one night, had started a terrible chain of thoughts in his mind.</t2320> <t2321>The young man remembered it as if it were a whip strike across his face.</t2321> <t2322>When he frowned, two deep lines formed in the middle of his forehead, and James bit his lip with an expression of pain.</t2322>
<t2323>Sibyl complained, "You are not listening to a single word I say!"</t2323> <t2324>"Yet I am making such brilliant plans for your future!</t2324> <t2325>Please, say something.</t2325><t2326>"</t2326>
<t2327>“What do you want me to say?</t2327><t2328>”</t2328>
<t2329>Sibyl looked at her brother and smiled, "Just tell him to behave and not forget us," she replied.</t2329>
<t2330>James shrugged his shoulders.</t2330> <t2331>"It's more likely that you will forget me than I will forget you, Sibyl.</t2331><t2332>"</t2332>
<t2333>The young girl turned bright pink.</t2333> <t2334>“What do you mean, Jim?”</t2334><t2335>”</t2335>
<t2336>“I heard you have a new friend.</t2336> <t2337>Who is this?..</t2337> <t2338>Why have you never told me about them?</t2338> <t2339>Their intentions towards you are not good at all.</t2339><t2340>”</t2340>
<t2341>The girl said, "Stop, Jim!"</t2341> <t2342>"Don't say anything bad about him.</t2342> <t2343>I love him.</t2343><t2344>"</t2344>
<t2345>The child replied, "My dear, you don't even know his name."</t2345> <t2346>"Who is this man?</t2346> <t2347>It's my right to know.</t2347><t2348>"</t2348>
<t2349>"His name is Sweet Prince.</t2349><t2350>Didn't you like this name?</t2350><t2351>Oh, silly child!</t2351><t2352>Never forget this.</t2352><t2353>If you saw him, you too would say he is the most extraordinary person in the world.</t2353><t2354>One day you will meet him.</t2354><t2355>When you return from Australia.</t2355><t2356>You will love him so much!</t2356><t2357>Everyone adores him, and I... love him too.</t2357><t2358>I wish you could come to the theater tonight.</t2358><t2359>He will come, and I will play Juliet.</t2359><t2360>If only you knew how I will play Juliet!</t2360><t2361>Jim, just think about it, being in love and playing Juliet!</t2361><t2362>Knowing that he is sitting there!</t2362><t2363>Acting to give him hope!</t2363><t2364>I am afraid I will either scare or enchant the audience.</t2364><t2365>Being in love means surpassing oneself.</t2365><t2366>That poor, ugly Mr. Isaacs will talk about my genius to his idle friends at the bar.</t2366><t2367>How many sermons he has given about me, as if I were a dogma!</t2367><t2368>Tonight he will declare to the world that I am an illusion!</t2368><t2369>I feel it in my bones.</t2369><t2370>It is all because of him, my Sweet Prince, my magnificent love, the god of all graces.</t2370><t2371>Next to him, I am very poor.</t2371><t2372>Poor?</t2372><t2373>What does it matter?</t2373><t2374>When poverty enters through the door, love flies out the window.</t2374><t2375>Our proverbs need to be rewritten.</t2375><t2376>They were written in winter, but now it is summer, even still spring for me, a dance of fruit blossoms against the blue sky.</t2376><t2377>"</t2377>
<t2378>His brother said with a sullen face, "He was a gentleman."</t2378>
<t2379>The girl shouted, "A prince!" in a voice like a song.</t2379> <t2380>"What more do you want?</t2380><t2381>"</t2381>
<t2382>“He wants to capture you.</t2382><t2383>”</t2383>
<t2384>“The thought of freedom gives me chills.</t2384><t2385>”</t2385>
<t2386>“I want you to stay away from him.</t2386><t2387>”</t2387>
<t2388>“To see him is to worship him, and to know him is to trust him.</t2388><t2389>”</t2389>
<t2390>“Sibyl, you are going mad for him.</t2390><t2391>”</t2391>
<t2392>Sibyl, laughing, took his arm.</t2392> <t2393>"My dear Jim, you talk as if you were a hundred years old.</t2393> <t2394>One day you will love too.</t2394> <t2395>Then you will understand how it is.</t2395> <t2396>Don't sulk like that.</t2396> <t2397>You are leaving, but you are leaving me happier than I have ever been before: Shouldn't you be glad about that?</t2397> <t2398>Both of our lives have been tough, Jim; extremely tough, challenging.</t2398> <t2399>But from now on, it will be different.</t2399> <t2400>You are going to a brand new world, and I have found a brand new world.</t2400> <t2401>Look, there are two seats over there, let's sit down and watch these elegant people passing by.</t2401><t2402>"</t2402>
<t2403>They took their places in the crowd.</t2403> <t2404>The tulip beds across the road were flickering like rings of fire.</t2404> <t2405>A trembling white mist, resembling iris dust, had settled in the air, which seemed to have lost its breath from the heat.</t2405> <t2406>Brightly colored umbrellas were bobbing up and down like giant butterflies.</t2406>
<t2407>Sibyl directed her brother to talk about himself, his hopes, his expectations, and his possibilities.</t2407> <t2408>Like players passing the ball in a game, they were tossing words back and forth to each other.</t2408> <t2409>A heaviness settled within Sibyl.</t2409> <t2410>She couldn't instill her happiness in her brother!</t2410> <t2411>The only response she could get was a barely perceptible smile that curved those sullen lips.</t2411> <t2412>After a while, she fell silent.</t2412> <t2413>Then suddenly, she caught sight of golden hair and smiling lips, and Dorian Gray passed by in an open car, accompanied by two ladies.</t2413>
<t2414>Sibyl had jumped to her feet.</t2414> <t2415>“There he is!” she shouted.</t2415>
<t2416>"Kim?</t2416><t2417>"</t2417>
<t2418>The girl, looking after the "Victoria" type car, responded, "Sweet Prince."</t2418>
<t2419>His brother also jumped up and roughly grabbed his arm.</t2419>
<t2420>“Show it to me.</t2420> <t2421>Which one? Point it out.</t2421> <t2422>Let me see it!” he shouted, but just then the Duke of Berwick's four-horse carriage got in the way.</t2422> <t2423>By the time it moved away, the other carriage had already left the park.</t2423>
<t2424>Sibyl sadly murmured, "She left."</t2424> <t2425>"I wanted you to see her!</t2425><t2426>"</t2426>
<t2427>“I would also like to see him, because, as God in heaven knows, if this man ever harms you one day, I will kill him too.</t2427><t2428>”</t2428>
<t2429>Sibyl stared at her brother in horror.</t2429> <t2430>James repeated his earlier words.</t2430> <t2431>His words seemed to cut through the air like a dagger.</t2431> <t2432>Those around them began to look at them with curiosity.</t2432> <t2433>A lady standing nearby laughed with a giggle.</t2433>
<t2434>Sibyl whispered, "Let's go, Jim, let's go."</t2434>
<t2435>He made his way through the crowd, and James followed him.</t2435> <t2436>He was glad he had said those words earlier.</t2436>
<t2437>When they arrived at the Statue of Achilles, Sibyl turned to her brother.</t2437> <t2438>The pity in her eyes was turning into a smile on her lips.</t2438> <t2439>She shook her head as if scolding him.</t2439>
<t2440>"You're talking nonsense, Jim, absolute nonsense.</t2440> <t2441>You're just a grumpy child, that's all.</t2441> <t2442>How can you say such horrible things?</t2442> <t2443>You have no idea what you're talking about.</t2443> <t2444>You're jealous and hurtful.</t2444> <t2445>Oh, I wish you would fall in love with someone!</t2445> <t2446>Love instills goodness in a person, whereas what you're saying is both bad and sinful.</t2446><t2447>"</t2447>
<t2448>His brother said, "I'm sixteen years old, I know what things are."</t2448> <t2449>"My mother is of no use to you.</t2449> <t2450>She doesn't know how to look after you.</t2450> <t2451>I wish I had never tried to go to Australia!</t2451> <t2452>The devil says to give it all up.</t2452> <t2453>And I would give it up too, but my contracts are signed.</t2453><t2454>"</t2454>
<t2455>“Oh, don't be so serious, Jim.</t2455> <t2456>You look like those heroes in silly melodramas.</t2456> <t2457>You know, the ones my mother loved to act in!</t2457> <t2458>Anyway, I'm not going to fight with you.</t2458> <t2459>I saw him!</t2459> <t2460>Oh, if you only knew, seeing him is pure happiness.</t2460> <t2461>We won't fight.</t2461> <t2462>I know, you could never harm someone I love, right?</t2462><t2463>”</t2463>
<t2464>James replied with a frown, "I guess I can't do it as long as you love him."</t2464>
<t2465>Sibyl shouted, "I will love him forever!"</t2465>
<t2466>“What about it?</t2466><t2467>”</t2467>
<t2468>“Forever and ever!”</t2468><t2469>”</t2469>
<t2470>“Love, or it will be bad.</t2470><t2471>”</t2471>
<t2472>Sibyl moved a little away from him.</t2472> <t2473>Then, laughing, she took his arm.</t2473> <t2474>James was still a child.</t2474>
<t2475>They took a marble there and boarded a bus.</t2475> <t2476>They got off near Euston Street, close to those poor houses.</t2476> <t2477>It was past five o'clock.</t2477> <t2478>Sibyl needed to lie down and rest for a few hours before going on stage.</t2478> <t2479>Jim insisted on this.</t2479> <t2480>He wanted to say goodbye to her away from their mother.</t2480> <t2481>Their mother would definitely cause a scene, and Jim was disgusted by all such scenes.</t2481>
<t2482>They said goodbye in Sibyl's room.</t2482> <t2483>The young man's heart was filled with jealousy, a bloody and bitter hatred towards the stranger he saw as coming between him and his sister.</t2483> <t2484>Yet, when Sibyl's arms wrapped around his neck and her fingers ran through his hair, James softened and kissed the girl with genuine affection.</t2484> <t2485>There were tears in his eyes as he walked down the stairs.</t2485>
<t2486>His mother was waiting for him downstairs.</t2486> <t2487>She muttered because he was late.</t2487> <t2488>James sat down at the head of the poor table without responding.</t2488> <t2489>Flies were buzzing around the table, crawling on the stained tablecloth.</t2489> <t2490>Amid the growl of buses and the clatter of trams, the young boy heard the droning sound that swallowed up the last moments in his home.</t2490>
<t2491>After a while, he pushed his plate away and put his head in his hands.</t2491> <t2492>He thought he had the right to know.</t2492> <t2493>If the situation was as he suspected, they should have told him earlier.</t2493> <t2494>His mother, her heart heavy with fear, was looking at him.</t2494> <t2495>Words were spilling from her lips like a machine, and she was twisting a torn lace handkerchief between her hands.</t2495> <t2496>When the clock struck six, James got up and walked to the door.</t2496> <t2497>Then he turned and looked at his mother.</t2497> <t2498>Their eyes met.</t2498> <t2499>James read a faint plea for mercy in his mother's eyes.</t2499> <t2500>This drove him mad with rage.</t2500>
<t2501>“Anne, there is something I want to ask you,” he said.</t2501> <t2502>Ms. Vane let her eyes wander aimlessly around the room, not responding.</t2502>
<t2503>“Tell me the truth.</t2503> <t2504>I have the right to know.</t2504> <t2505>Were you married to my father?</t2505><t2506>”</t2506>
<t2507>Ms. Vane took a deep breath.</t2507> <t2508>It was a sigh of relief.</t2508> <t2509>That tremendous moment, the moment she had been waiting for with dread every day and night for weeks, months, had finally arrived, but the woman was not afraid.</t2509> <t2510>To tell the truth, it was somewhat disappointing for her.</t2510> <t2511>The question being asked so plainly and directly required a straightforward answer.</t2511> <t2512>The situation had not developed gradually!</t2512> <t2513>It was indeed rude.</t2513> <t2514>It reminded Ms. Vane of a poorly performed rehearsal.</t2514>
<t2515>The woman, while responding "No," was feeling astonished by the harsh simplicity of life.</t2515>
<t2516>The child clenched his fists and shouted, "So my father was a scoundrel!"</t2516>
<t2517>His mother shook her head.</t2517> <t2518>“I knew he wasn't free.</t2518> <t2519>We loved each other very much.</t2519> <t2520>If he had lived, he would have provided for us.</t2520> <t2521>Don't speak ill of him, my child.</t2521> <t2522>He was your father and a gentleman.</t2522> <t2523>Believe me, he came from a very distinguished family.</t2523><t2524>”</t2524>
<t2525>A curse word escaped from James's lips.</t2525> <t2526>The boy said, "I don't care for myself."</t2526> <t2527>"But don't you dare...</t2527> <t2528>The man who is in love with her is a gentleman, isn't he, or at least he claims to be.</t2528> <t2529>Maybe he is also from a very high family.</t2529><t2530>"</t2530>
<t2531>For a moment, the woman felt as if she was sinking into the ground.</t2531> <t2532>Her head dropped forward.</t2532> <t2533>She wiped her eyes with trembling hands.</t2533> <t2534>“Sibyl has a mother,” she murmured.</t2534> <t2535>“I was motherless.</t2535><t2536>”</t2536>
<t2537>The child's heart ached.</t2537> <t2538>He went and kissed his mother.</t2538> <t2539>“If I upset you by asking about my father, forgive me,” he said.</t2539> <t2540>“I couldn't help but ask.</t2540> <t2541>I have to go now.</t2541> <t2542>Goodbye.</t2542> <t2543>Remember: You now have only one child who needs care.</t2543> <t2544>Believe me, if this man harms Sibyl, I will find out who he is, track him down, and kill him like a dog.</t2544> <t2545>I swear it.</t2545><t2546>”</t2546>
<t2547>The exaggerated madness of the threat, the child's fiery behavior while saying it, the reckless melodrama in the words, seemed to have brought some liveliness to the woman's life.</t2547> <t2548>She knew this atmosphere well.</t2548> <t2549>Now she was breathing more easily and, for the first time in months, felt a genuine admiration for her son.</t2549> <t2550>She wished she could prolong this scene with such sentimentality, but her son cut it short.</t2550> <t2551>There were trunks to be moved downstairs, scarves to be found and packed.</t2551> <t2552>The boarding house servants were bustling about.</t2552> <t2553>There was still bargaining to be done with the coachman.</t2553> <t2554>The moment of departure got lost among trivial details.</t2554> <t2555>As she waved the torn lace handkerchief from the window after her son, Ms. Vane felt a fresh wave of disappointment within her.</t2555> <t2556>She was aware that a great opportunity had been wasted.</t2556> <t2557>To console herself, she told Sybil that her life would become much lonelier from now on because she had only one child left to care for.</t2557> <t2558>She had not forgotten her son's words.</t2558> <t2559>But she did not mention the threat he had made.</t2559> <t2560>The child had delivered this intimidation in a very lively, dramatic manner.</t2560> <t2561>Ms. Vane thought that one day all three of them would remember this and laugh.</t2561>

<t2567>Chapter Six</t2567>
<t2568>That evening, when Basil Hallward was shown into the room where a table for three had been set up at the Briston Hotel, Lord Henry asked, "You must have heard the news, haven't you, Basil?"</t2568>
<t2569>Handing his painter's hat and coat to the bowing waiter in front of him, he said, "No."</t2569> <t2570>"What happened?</t2570> <t2571>I hope it isn't something related to politics?</t2571> <t2572>Politics doesn't interest me at all.</t2572> <t2573>There's not a single person in the House of Commons worth painting, but it would be great if many of them got a good whitewashing.</t2573><t2574>"</t2574>
<t2575>Lord Henry, looking at him carefully, said, "Dorian Gray is engaged."</t2575>
<t2576>The painter suddenly flinched, then frowned.</t2576> <t2577>“Did you say Dorian is engaged?</t2577> <t2578>Impossible!</t2578><t2579>”</t2579>
<t2580>"It has happened."</t2580><t2581>"</t2581>
<t2582>“With whom?</t2582><t2583>”</t2583>
<t2584>“With some little actress.</t2584><t2585>”</t2585>
<t2586>“I can't believe it.</t2586> <t2587>Dorian is sensible enough not to do such a thing.</t2587><t2588>”</t2588>
<t2589>“Dorian is wise enough to occasionally avoid making foolish mistakes, my dear Basil.</t2589><t2590>”</t2590>
<t2591>“Harry, marriage is not something one does just occasionally, surely.</t2591><t2592>”</t2592>
<t2593>“Unless we are in America,” said Lord Henry lazily.</t2593> <t2594>“I didn't tell you that he got married.</t2594> <t2595>I said he got engaged.</t2595> <t2596>There is a big difference between the two.</t2596> <t2597>I clearly remember getting married but I can't remember getting engaged at all.</t2597> <t2598>Many times, I feel like I never got engaged.</t2598><t2599>”</t2599>
<t2600>“But think about Dorian’s family, his place in society, and his wealth.</t2600> <t2601>It would be ridiculous for him to marry a girl of such a lower status.</t2601><t2602>”</t2602>
<t2603>“If you really want him to marry this girl, go and tell him that, Basil.</t2603> <t2604>Then he will definitely marry her.</t2604> <t2605>Whenever a person does something utterly foolish, it is always for the noblest of purposes.</t2605><t2606>”</t2606>
<t2607>“I hope this girl is a good person, Harry.</t2607> <t2608>I don't want Dorian to be tied to a disgusting creature.</t2608> <t2609>Then his personality would degrade, his mind would dull.</t2609><t2610>”</t2610>
<t2611>Lord Henry, sipping vermouth with an orange essence from his glass, murmured, "The girl is not just good, she is beautiful."</t2611> <t2612>"Dorian says she is beautiful, and he is rarely wrong about such things.</t2612> <t2613>Thanks to the portrait you painted, he has become more sensitive to the appearance of others.</t2613> <t2614>The portrait had such a good effect, besides its other benefits.</t2614> <t2615>If the boy doesn't forget his appointment, we will see the girl tonight.</t2615><t2616>"</t2616>
<t2617>“Are you serious?</t2617><t2618>”</t2618>
<t2619>“I am very serious, Basil.</t2619> <t2620>If I believed I could be more serious than I am right now, I would mourn.</t2620><t2621>”</t2621>
<t2622>The painter paced up and down the room, biting his lip, and asked, "Well, do you approve of this, Harry?"</t2622> <t2623>"You can't possibly approve of it.</t2623> <t2624>It's a ridiculous, fleeting whim.</t2624><t2625>"</t2625>
<t2626>“I no longer react to anything positively or negatively, my friend.</t2626> <t2627>Taking such an attitude towards life is ridiculous.</t2627> <t2628>We don't come into the world to explain our prejudices about morality.</t2628> <t2629>I never listen to what ordinary, stereotypical people say; nor do I interfere with the actions of charming, distinguished people.</t2629> <t2630>If I find someone very attractive, whatever method of expression they choose, it delights me.</t2630> <t2631>Dorian Gray is infatuated with a lovely girl who plays Juliet on stage and is planning to marry her.</t2631> <t2632>Why not?</t2632> <t2633>Even if Dorian married Messalina, he wouldn't lose any of his interest in my eyes.</t2633> <t2634>You know that I am not one of the defenders of marriage.</t2634> <t2635>The real drawback of marriage is that it makes a person domesticated.</t2635> <t2636>Domesticated people are also colorless.</t2636> <t2637>They lack individuality.</t2637> <t2638>On the other hand, there are those whom marriage complicates instead.</t2638> <t2639>Such people preserve their selfishness and add many other selves on top of it.</t2639> <t2640>They are forced to live multiple lives.</t2640> <t2641>They achieve better organization.</t2641> <t2642>In my opinion, this is the purpose of human existence.</t2642> <t2643>After all, every experience has value.</t2643> <t2644>No matter what anyone says, it is undeniable that marriage is an experience.</t2644> <t2645>My hope is that Dorian Gray marries this girl, worships her madly for six months, and then suddenly falls under the spell of someone else.</t2645> <t2646>It would be a delightful subject to study.</t2646><t2647>”</t2647>
<t2648>“You are not serious about a single thing you say, Harry.</t2648> <t2649>You are not, and you know it.</t2649> <t2650>If Dorian Gray's life were to fade, you would be the most upset.</t2650> <t2651>You are actually much kinder at heart than the poses you assume.</t2651><t2652>”</t2652>
<t2653>Lord Henry laughed.</t2653> <t2654>"We all love to attribute goodness to others because we all fear for our own heads.</t2654> <t2655>The basis of optimism is sheer terror.</t2655> <t2656>We think ourselves magnanimous because we can see virtues in our neighbors that might benefit us.</t2656> <t2657>We praise the banker so we can withdraw more money from our account, and we find good qualities in the highwayman so he won't rob us.</t2657> <t2658>I was serious in everything I said.</t2658> <t2659>I utterly despise optimism.</t2659> <t2660>As for the extinguishing of life; no life is extinguished, as long as its development hasn't been cut short.</t2660> <t2661>If you want to ruin a character, just reform it!</t2661> <t2662>As for marriage, it's certainly nonsense, but there are other, more interesting bonds between men and women.</t2662> <t2663>I will not refrain from encouraging these.</t2663> <t2664>They all have the allure of being the latest fashion.</t2664> <t2665>But look, here comes Dorian.</t2665> <t2666>He will give you more information than I can.</t2666><t2667>"</t2667>
<t2668>“Dear Harry, dear Basil, you both must congratulate me!” said the young man, throwing off his satin-lined cloak and shaking his friends' hands one by one.</t2668> <t2669>“I have never been this happy in my life.</t2669> <t2670>I know, it was sudden.</t2670> <t2671>All joyful things are, but still, it feels like this is what I have been searching for all my life.”</t2671> <t2672>Flushed with excitement and happiness, he looked extraordinarily handsome.</t2672>
<t2673>Hallward said, "I hope you will be happy for life, Dorian."</t2673> <t2674>"Still, I can't quite forgive you for not informing me of your engagement.</t2674> <t2675>You told Harry."</t2675><t2676>"</t2676>
<t2677>"I can't forgive you for being late to dinner either," said Lord Henry, interrupting and placing his hand on the young man's shoulder.</t2677> <t2678>He was smiling.</t2678> <t2679>"Come on, let's sit down and see how the new chef is.</t2679> <t2680>You can tell us how all this happened.</t2680><t2681>"</t2681>
<t2682>As they sat down at the small, round table, Dorian said, "There isn't much to tell."</t2682> <t2683>"Here's what happened: Harry, after leaving you last night, I changed my clothes, had dinner at that little Italian restaurant on Rupert Street that you taught me about, and went to the theater at eight o'clock.</t2683> <t2684>Sibyl was playing Rosalind.</t2684> <t2685>The set was terrible, and the actor playing Orlando was ridiculous, naturally.</t2685> <t2686>But Sibyl! If only you could have seen her!</t2686> <t2687>When she came on stage dressed as a boy, she was simply marvelous.</t2687> <t2688>She wore a tight, moss-colored velvet jacket with loose, cinnamon-colored sleeves, long brown stockings, and a cloak with a dull red lining and a hood!</t2688> <t2689>She also had a delicate, tiny green hat on her head.</t2689> <t2690>A hawk feather was fastened to the hat with a shiny stone.</t2690> <t2691>She looked more elegant and perfect than ever to me.</t2691> <t2692>Basil, you know that Tanagra figurine in your studio, well, Sibyl reflected that delicate harmony.</t2692> <t2693>Her hair was piled around her face like dark leaves around a pale-colored rose.</t2693> <t2694>As for her performance...</t2694> <t2695>Well, you'll see her tonight.</t2695> <t2696>This girl is a born artist, in a word.</t2696> <t2697>While sitting in that musty box, I was completely captivated.</t2697> <t2698>I forgot I was in London, living in the nineteenth century.</t2698> <t2699>I was in a distant forest, unseen by anyone, with my beloved.</t2699> <t2700>When the curtain fell, I went backstage and talked to her.</t2700> <t2701>While we were sitting side by side, a look appeared in her eyes that I had never seen before.</t2701> <t2702>My lips moved towards hers.</t2702> <t2703>We kissed.</t2703> <t2704>I can't describe to you what I felt at that moment.</t2704> <t2705>It was as if my entire life had culminated in a perfect, rose-colored point of joy.</t2705> <t2706>She was trembling from head to toe, shaking like a white narcissus flower.</t2706> <t2707>Then she knelt down and began to kiss my hands...</t2707> <t2708>It feels as if I shouldn't be telling you all this, yet I can't help myself.</t2708> <t2709>Our engagement is very secret, of course.</t2709> <t2710>She hasn't even told her own mother yet.</t2710> <t2711>I don't know what my guardians will say about this.</t2711> <t2712>Lord Radley will be absolutely furious.</t2712> <t2713>I don't care.</t2713> <t2714>In less than a year, I'll come of age, and then I can do whatever I want.</t2714> <t2715>Basil, I did the right thing by finding my love in poetry and choosing my wife from Shakespeare's plays, didn't I?</t2715> <t2716>Lips that learned to speak from Shakespeare whispered their secrets into my ear.</t2716> <t2717>Rosalind wrapped her arms around my neck; I kissed Juliet on the mouth.</t2717><t2718>"</t2718>
<t2719>Hallward replied slowly, "Yes, Dorian, I think you have done the right thing."</t2719>
<t2720>Lord Henry asked, "Did you see Sibyl today?"</t2720>
<t2721>Dorian Gray shook his head.</t2721> <t2722>“I left it in the Forest of Aden, I will find it in an orchard in Verona.</t2722><t2723>”</t2723>
<t2724>Lord Henry, sipping his champagne thoughtfully, asked, "Dorian, at what point did you mention marriage?"</t2724> <t2725>"What was her response?</t2725> <t2726>Or have you forgotten these things?</t2726><t2727>"</t2727>
<t2728>“Dear Harry, I didn't approach this matter like a job contract, nor did I make a formal proposal.</t2728> <t2729>I said that I loved her, and she said that she didn't consider herself worthy of being my wife.</t2729> <t2730>Not worthy!</t2730> <t2731>But in my eyes, the world on one side, and her on the other.</t2731><t2732>”</t2732>
<t2733>Lord Henry murmured, "Women are extraordinarily practical."</t2733> <t2734>"Much more practical than we are.</t2734> <t2735>In situations like this, we often forget to bring up marriage, but they always remind us.</t2735><t2736>"</t2736>
<t2737>Hallward put his hand on his arm.</t2737> <t2738>"Don't do it, Harry."</t2738> <t2739>"You have upset Dorian."</t2739> <t2740>"Dorian is not like other men."</t2740> <t2741>"He would never intentionally cause anyone pain."</t2741> <t2742>"His soul is too noble for such things."</t2742><t2743>"</t2743>
<t2744>Lord Henry, looking across the table, replied, "Dorian never gets angry with me."</t2744> <t2745>"I asked that question for the most valid reason in the world; or rather, the only reason to ask any question, which is simple curiosity.</t2745> <t2746>I have a theory: Men do not propose to women.</t2746> <t2747>The marriage proposal always comes from the woman.</t2747> <t2748>The middle-class life is an exception to this, naturally.</t2748> <t2749>But the middle classes are not contemporary anyway.</t2749><t2750>"</t2750>
<t2751>Dorian Gray threw his head back laughing.</t2751> <t2752>“You will never come around, Harry, but I don't care.</t2752> <t2753>There is no way to be angry with you.</t2753> <t2754>When you see Sibyl Vane, you will understand, anyone who harms her is a monster, a heartless monster.</t2754> <t2755>I can't understand how someone can disgrace what they love.</t2755> <t2756>I love Sibyl Vane.</t2756> <t2757>I want to raise her on a golden throne, to see the whole world worship the woman I love.</t2757> <t2758>What is marriage?</t2758> <t2759>An irrevocable vow.</t2759> <t2760>That is why you mock marriage.</t2760> <t2761>My dear, don't mock it.</t2761> <t2762>I want to take this irrevocable vow.</t2762> <t2763>Sibyl's trust in me instills loyalty in me, her faith makes me a good person.</t2763> <t2764>When I am with her, I regret learning what you taught me.</t2764> <t2765>I become a different person than the one you know.</t2765> <t2766>I am changing.</t2766> <t2767>A single touch of Sibyl Vane's hand makes me forget all your wrong, enchanting, poisonous, delightful theories.</t2767><t2768>”</t2768>
<t2769>Lord Henry, taking some salad onto his plate, asked, "Well, what are these theories?"</t2769>
<t2770>"Oh, here are your theories about life, about love, about pleasure.</t2770> <t2771>In short, all your theories, Harry.</t2771><t2772>"</t2772>
<t2773>Lord Henry, with his languid, melodious voice, said, "The only thing worth developing a theory about is pleasure."</t2773> <t2774>"However, I cannot claim that this theory is my own.</t2774> <t2775>It belongs to Nature, not to me.</t2775> <t2776>Pleasure is Nature's test, its approval symbol.</t2776> <t2777>When we are happy, we are always good people, but when we are good people, we may not necessarily be happy.</t2777><t2778>"</t2778>
<t2779>Basil Hallward asked, "What do you mean by a beautiful but good person?"</t2779>
<t2780>Dorian said, "Yes," approving him.</t2780> <t2781>He leaned back and looked at Lord Henry over the purple-lipped sesame flowers in the middle of the table.</t2781> <t2782>"What do you mean by the definition of a good person, Harry?</t2782><t2783>"</t2783>
<t2784>Lord Henry, touching the thin stem of his glass with those pale, pointed fingers, said, "To be a good person means to be in harmony with oneself."</t2784> <t2785>"Disharmony is being forced to be in harmony with others.</t2785> <t2786>One's own life: That is what matters.</t2786> <t2787>As for the lives of our neighbors; if one wants to be conservative or puritanical, they can proclaim their moral views about them, but in reality, they do not concern us at all.</t2787> <t2788>Moreover, the aim pursued by individuality is higher.</t2788> <t2789>Contemporary morality is merely adopting the standards of the age.</t2789> <t2790>In my opinion, for any cultured person to adopt the standards of their age is the grossest form of immorality.</t2790><t2791>"</t2791>
<t2792>The painter said, "But Harry, if a person lives solely for themselves, don't they inevitably pay a tremendous price in return?"</t2792>
<t2793>“Yes, these days I buy everything at an extremely high price.</t2793> <t2794>In my opinion, the real tragedy of the poor is that their purses are only enough to fill their stomachs.</t2794> <t2795>Beautiful sins, like beautiful objects, are the domain of the rich.</t2795><t2796>”</t2796>
<t2797>“A person has to pay this price with things other than money as well.</t2797><t2798>”</t2798>
<t2799>“For example, what kind of things, Basil?</t2799><t2800>”</t2800>
<t2801>“How should I know, regret, remorse, then...</t2801> <t2802>The consciousness of humiliation.</t2802><t2803>”</t2803>
<t2804>Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders.</t2804> <t2805>"My dear, Medieval art is quite charming, however, the fashion of Medieval sentiments is long gone.</t2805> <t2806>We can use these sentiments in novels.</t2806> <t2807>But aren't the things we use in novels precisely the things we don't use in real life?</t2807> <t2808>Believe me, no civilized person regrets the pleasure they have enjoyed, and no primitive person knows what pleasure is.</t2808><t2809>"</t2809>
<t2810>Dorian exclaimed, "I know what pleasure is!"</t2810> <t2811>"Worshiping someone.</t2811><t2812>"</t2812>
<t2813>Lord Henry, turning the fruits over, replied, "Yes, it is better than being worshipped."</t2813> <t2814>"Being worshipped is tedious.</t2814> <t2815>As mankind treats their gods, so do women treat us.</t2815> <t2816>They worship us, constantly prodding us to do something for them.</t2816><t2817>"</t2817>
<t2818>Dorian replied with a serious expression, "If you ask me, whatever it is they want from us, it's the things they initially gave us."</t2818> <t2819>"They create love within our being.</t2819> <t2820>They have the right to ask this from us.</t2820><t2821>"</t2821>
<t2822>Hallward said, "You spoke very correctly, Dorian."</t2822>
<t2823>Lord Henry speculated, "Nothing is completely true."</t2823>
<t2824>Dorian, "This is true, but," he cut him short.</t2824> <t2825>"You must accept this, Harry.</t2825> <t2826>Women give men the golden ore of their lives.</t2826><t2827>"</t2827>
<t2828>Lord Henry sighed, "Maybe."</t2828> <t2829>"However, they always want it back as forty pence.</t2829> <t2830>That's the problem.</t2830> <t2831>As a witty Frenchman once said, women inspire us to create masterpieces, only to prevent us from doing so every time.</t2831><t2832>"</t2832>
<t2833>"Harry, you are so bad!"</t2833> <t2834>"I don't know why I love you so much."</t2834><t2835></t2835>
<t2836>“You will love me for a lifetime, Dorian...</t2836> <t2837>Gentlemen, would you like some coffee?..</t2837> <t2838>Waiter, bring coffee, the best champagne, and a box of cigarettes.</t2838> <t2839>No, he doesn't want cigarettes; I have some.</t2839> <t2840>Basil, I can't allow you to smoke a cigar, take a cigarette from there.</t2840> <t2841>A cigarette is a perfect example of perfect pleasure.</t2841>
<t2842>It is insatiable and leaves one unsatisfied when it ends.</t2842> <t2843>What else is desired in life?</t2843> <t2844>Yes, Dorian, you will always love me.</t2844> <t2845>Because I symbolize all the sins you dare not commit.</t2845><t2846>”</t2846>
<t2847>The young man said, "You're talking nonsense, Harry!" and took a match from the silver dragon that the waiter had left on the table, which was breathing fire.</t2847> <t2848>"Let's go to the theater.</t2848> <t2849>When Sibyl takes the stage, you will have gained a new ideal in life.</t2849> <t2850>In your eyes, she will symbolize something you have never known before.</t2850><t2851>"</t2851>
<t2852>Lord Henry, with a tired look in his eyes, said, "I have tasted everything."</t2852> <t2853>"Yet, I am always open to new emotions.</t2853> <t2854>But I fear that such a thing cannot happen, at least for me.</t2854> <t2855>Anyway, your wonderful girl might just enchant me.</t2855> <t2856>I adore theater acting.</t2856> <t2857>It is much more real than real life.</t2857> <t2858>Come on, let's go.</t2858> <t2859>Dorian, you are coming with me.</t2859> <t2860>Basil, I am very sorry, my car is a two-seater.</t2860> <t2861>You will have to follow in another car.</t2861>
<t2862>They stood up, sipping their coffee while putting on their coats.</t2862> <t2863>The painter was lost in his own thoughts, silent.</t2863> <t2864>A sense of unease had settled over him.</t2864> <t2865>He couldn't bear the thought of this marriage, yet he still thought it was better than many other possibilities that came to mind.</t2865>
<t2866>They went down a few minutes later.</t2866> <t2867>The painter, as agreed, got into a carriage alone and fixed his eyes on the gleaming lights of the small carriage ahead.</t2867> <t2868>A strange feeling of loss enveloped him.</t2868> <t2869>He sensed that he would never again find the old closeness he had with Dorian Gray.</t2869> <t2870>Life had come between them...</t2870> <t2871>His vision darkened, and those crowded, lit-up streets vanished before his eyes.</t2871> <t2872>When the carriage stopped in front of the theater, Basil Hallward felt as if he had aged years.</t2872>
<t2873>Seventh chapter</t2873>
<t2874>For some reason, the theater was crowded that night.</t2874> <t2875>The fat Jewish manager who greeted them at the door was grinning from ear to ear with a shaky, slimy smile.</t2875> <t2876>He led them to their box seats with a mixture of ostentation and obsequiousness, waving his fat, ringed hands and speaking at the top of his voice.</t2876> <t2877>Dorian Gray felt a greater disgust for him than ever before.</t2877> <t2878>It was as if he had come to fetch Miranda and encountered Caliban instead.</t2878> <t2879>However, Lord Henry had taken quite a liking to him.</t2879> <t2880>Or rather, he said he had.</t2880> <t2881>He insisted on shaking his hand and remarked that he had discovered a true genius and was proud to meet a man who had been driven to bankruptcy because of a poet.</t2881> <t2882>Hallward was passing the time by observing the faces of the people in the hall.</t2882> <t2883>The heat was stifling, and the large chandelier blazed like a giant sunflower with yellow flames.</t2883> <t2884>The young men in the balcony had taken off their jackets and vests and hung them on the railing.</t2884> <t2885>They were talking to each other from one end of the theater to the other, sharing the oranges in their hands with the shabby-looking girls sitting next to them.</t2885> <t2886>Some women were laughing.</t2886> <t2887>Their voices were very shrill, very grating.</t2887> <t2888>The sound of popping corks was coming from the bar.</t2888>
<t2889>Lord Henry, "Just the place where one would find their goddess!" he said.</t2889>
<t2890>Dorian Gray replied, "Yes."</t2890> <t2891>"I found her right here; she is more heavenly to me than all other creatures.</t2891> <t2892>Once she starts her performance, you will forget everything.</t2892> <t2893>All these vulgar, uncouth people with their coarse faces and rough manners...</t2893> <t2894>They become completely different when she steps onto the stage.</t2894> <t2895>They sit silently and watch her.</t2895> <t2896>They cry and laugh according to her will.</t2896> <t2897>She draws sounds from them like a violin.</t2897> <t2898>She spiritualizes them.</t2898> <t2899>So much so that it feels like they carry the same flesh and blood as us.</t2899><t2900>"</t2900>
<t2901>Lord Henry, who was surveying the people on the balcony with his binoculars, exclaimed, "The same flesh and blood as us!</t2901> <t2902>Never!"</t2902>
<t2903>The painter said, "Don't mind him, Dorian."</t2903> <t2904>"I understand what you mean, and I trust this girl too.</t2904> <t2905>Whoever you love is extraordinary; the girl who creates the effect you described is, whoever she may be, superior and noble.</t2905> <t2906>To spiritualize one's age...</t2906> <t2907>That is truly a valuable endeavor.</t2907> <t2908>If this girl can create a soul in those who have lived soulless lives, can evoke a sense of beauty in those who have led dirty and ugly lives, can strip them of their selfishness and make them shed tears for the troubles of others...</t2908> <t2909>Then this girl is worthy of your worship, and the world's worship.</t2909> <t2910>This marriage would be very fitting.</t2910> <t2911>I didn't think so at first, but now I accept its suitability.</t2911> <t2912>The gods have created Sibyl Vane for you.</t2912> <t2913>Without her, you would be incomplete.</t2913><t2914>"</t2914>
<t2915>Dorian Gray, "Thank you, Basil," he said, shaking the painter's hand.</t2915> <t2916>"I knew you would understand me.</t2916> <t2917>Harry is so cynical that he scares me.</t2917> <t2918>Anyway, here's the orchestra.</t2918> <t2919>A rather terrible orchestra, but fortunately it only lasts five minutes.</t2919> <t2920>Then the curtain will rise...</t2920> <t2921>You will see the girl to whom I have dedicated my entire life.</t2921> <t2922>I have already dedicated everything good in me to her.</t2922><t2923>"</t2923>
<t2924>A quarter of an hour later, amidst an astonishing storm of applause, Sibyl Vane came on stage.</t2924> <t2925>She was indeed beautiful; Lord Henry admitted that she was one of the most beautiful creatures he had ever seen in his life.</t2925> <t2926>There was something in her shy elegance, in her timid eyes that resembled a deer.</t2926> <t2927>As the girl looked at the crowded, enthusiastic hall, a blush resembling the shadow of a rose reflected in a silver mirror appeared on her cheeks.</t2927> <t2928>The young girl took a couple of steps back; her lips seemed to be trembling.</t2928> <t2929>Basil Hallward jumped up from his seat and started clapping.</t2929> <t2930>Dorian Gray, however, sat motionless, staring at the girl as if in a dream.</t2930> <t2931>Lord Henry, looking through his binoculars, murmured, “Very nice, very nice.”</t2931>
<t2932>The scene was the hall of the Capulet house.</t2932> <t2933>Disguised as a traveler, Romeo had entered with Mercutio and his other friends.</t2933> <t2934>The orchestra began to play something as best as they could, and the dance began.</t2934> <t2935>In the crowd of poorly dressed, clumsy actors, Sibyl Vane resembled a creature from a superior, more beautiful world.</t2935> <t2936>As she danced, her body swayed like reeds in the water.</t2936> <t2937>The round lines of her neck were like the round lines of a white lily.</t2937> <t2938>Her hands seemed to be made of cool ivory.</t2938>
<t2939>However, there was a strange awkwardness about him.</t2939> <t2940>When his eyes fell on Romeo, he showed no sign of joy.</t2940> <t2941>A few words he had to say:</t2941>
<t2942>"Dear traveler, you are being unfair to your hands,"</t2942>
<t2943>For the hands hold the greeting of God.</t2943>
<t2944>The saints bless the travelers with their hands,</t2944>
<t2945>The touching of palms is the kiss of sisters...</t2945><t2946>”</t2946>
<t2947>and then delivered the following short line with an entirely artificial demeanor.</t2947> <t2948>Although his voice was exquisite, his intonation was completely affected, the color was wrong.</t2948> <t2949>He was extinguishing all the vitality of the poem he read.</t2949> <t2950>He was rendering the fire of love insubstantial.</t2950>
<t2951>Dorian Gray was turning pale as he looked at her.</t2951> <t2952>He was surprised, anxious.</t2952> <t2953>Neither of his friends dared to say anything to him.</t2953> <t2954>The girl had seemed completely inadequate in their eyes.</t2954> <t2955>They were disappointed.</t2955>
<t2956>Gene believed that the real test for all Juliets was the balcony scene in the second act, and they were waiting for it.</t2956> <t2957>If the girl failed in this as well, it meant she had no talent at all.</t2957>
<t2958>When Sibyl stepped onto the moonlit stage, she was captivating.</t2958> <t2959>This was undeniable.</t2959> <t2960>However, the artificiality of her performance was unbearable, and it was getting worse.</t2960> <t2961>Now, a ridiculous artificiality had crept into her gestures as well.</t2961> <t2962>She was overemphasizing everything she said.</t2962>
<t2963>"You know, the mask of the night is on my face,"</t2963>
<t2964>Or would the young girl paint my cheek pink</t2964>
<t2965>Because of the words I said to you tonight...</t2965><t2966>”</t2966>
<t2967>that beautiful section was read with the tense attention of a school child trained by a second-rate rhetoric teacher.</t2967> <t2968>When Sibyl leaned over the balcony and it came to those magnificent lines;</t2968>
<t2969>“I'm happy that you're coming, but</t2969>
<t2970>This evening's agreement does not bring me joy.</t2970>
<t2971>Because very sudden, very crazy, very reckless.</t2971>
<t2972>Just like lightning, it 'struck'</t2972>
<t2973>Fading away...</t2973> <t2974>Sweetheart, good night!</t2974>
<t2975>I hope this small bud of love</t2975>
<t2976>Let it flourish and grow with the warm breath of summer</t2976>
<t2977>Let Dilber be a flower, we start anew</t2977>
<t2978>Until we meet again...</t2978><t2979>”</t2979>
<t2980>He read these as if they meant nothing to him.</t2980> <t2981>This was not uneasiness or fear.</t2981> <t2982>On the contrary, the young woman was completely free from uneasiness, entirely in control of herself, in a word, she was acting poorly.</t2982> <t2983>She was completely unsuccessful.</t2983>
<t2984>Even the ordinary, uneducated spectators in the living room and on the balcony lost interest in the play.</t2984> <t2985>They started to fidget, talk loudly, and whistle.</t2985> <t2986>The Jewish manager standing in the back was stomping in anger, cursing and swearing.</t2986> <t2987>The only person who was indifferent was the girl herself.</t2987>
<t2988>When the second act ended, boos erupted like a storm, and Lord Henry stood up and put on his coat.</t2988> <t2989>"The girl is extremely beautiful, Dorian, but she has no acting talent," he said.</t2989> <t2990>"Let's go.</t2990><t2991>"</t2991>
<t2992>The young man said in a bitter, harsh voice, "I will watch until the end."</t2992> <t2993>"I am very sorry for wasting your night, Harry.</t2993> <t2994>I apologize to both of you.</t2994><t2995>"</t2995>
<t2996>Hallward said, "Dear Dorian, Miss Vane was probably ill."</t2996> <t2997>"We will come again another night.</t2997><t2998>"</t2998>
<t2999>Dorian replied, "I wish she were ill."</t2999> <t3000>"She seemed emotionless, cold to me.</t3000> <t3001>She has fundamentally changed.</t3001> <t3002>Last night, she was a great artist.</t3002> <t3003>Tonight, she is an ordinary, average actress.</t3003><t3004>"</t3004>
<t3005>"Don't talk about your loved ones in this manner, Dorian.</t3005> <t3006>Love is something superior to art.</t3006><t3007>"</t3007>
<t3008>Lord Henry expressed his opinion, "Both are nothing more than forms of imitation."</t3008> <t3009>"But come on, let's go.</t3009> <t3010>Dorian, don't linger here.</t3010> <t3011>Bad acting corrupts morals.</t3011> <t3012>Besides, I don't think you would want your wife to be on stage.</t3012> <t3013>So what if she acts like a wooden doll as Juliet?</t3013> <t3014>The girl is a sight to behold.</t3014> <t3015>If she is as naive in life as she is on stage, it will be an enjoyable experience for you.</t3015> <t3016>There are only two types of people who are interesting and attractive: those who know everything and those who know nothing.</t3016> <t3017>Oh dear, my dear boy, don't look so tragic!</t3017> <t3018>The secret to staying young is to avoid emotions that don't suit your face.</t3018> <t3019>Come, join us at the club.</t3019> <t3020>We'll light a cigarette and toast to Sibyl Vane's beauty.</t3020> <t3021>The girl is truly beautiful.</t3021> <t3022>What more do you want?</t3022><t3023>"</t3023>
<t3024>The young man shouted, "Harry, go away!"</t3024> <t3025>"I want to be alone.</t3025> <t3026>Basil, you go too.</t3026> <t3027>Oh, my heart is breaking, can't you see?</t3027><t3028>"</t3028>
<t3029>Warm tears filled her eyes, her lips were trembling.</t3029> <t3030>She ran and entered the box, leaning against the wall and hiding her face in her hands.</t3030>
<t3031>Lord Henry said, "Let's go, Basil."</t3031> <t3032>There was a strange softness, a tenderness in his voice.</t3032> <t3033>The two young men went out together.</t3033>
<t3034>A few minutes later, the lights at the bottom of the stage came on and the third act began.</t3034> <t3035>Dorian took his place.</t3035> <t3036>He stood pale, proud, and indifferent.</t3036> <t3037>The play dragged on and seemed like it would never end.</t3037> <t3038>Half of the audience, clattering their rough shoes, left the hall laughing.</t3038> <t3039>It was a complete fiasco.</t3039> <t3040>The last part was performed to an almost empty hall.</t3040> <t3041>The curtain fell amidst giggles and sighs.</t3041>
<t3042>As soon as the play was over, Dorian ran backstage, to the dressing room.</t3042> <t3043>Sibyl was standing there alone, with an expression on her face as if she had won a victory.</t3043> <t3044>Her eyes were shining with a delightful light, her entire being seemed to be glowing.</t3044> <t3045>Her slightly parted lips were smiling as if at a secret only she knew.</t3045>
<t3046>When Dorian entered, the girl looked at him, and an infinite joy spread across her face.</t3046>
<t3047>"Dorian, I gave a terrible performance tonight!"</t3047><t3048>"</t3048>
<t3049>Dorian looked at him in astonishment and said, "Terrible!"</t3049> <t3050>"Terrible! It was awful.</t3050> <t3051>Are you sick?</t3051> <t3052>You can't imagine how I writhed."</t3052><t3053></t3053>
<t3054>Sibyl smiled and said, "Dorian."</t3054> <t3055>She elongated his name with the languid music of her voice, as if this name was sweeter than honey on the red rose petal of her lips.</t3055> <t3056>"Dorian, you should have understood.</t3056> <t3057>Anyway, you understand now, don't you?</t3057><t3058>"</t3058>
<t3059>Dorian asked angrily, "What do I understand?"</t3059>
<t3060>“Why I played so badly tonight.</t3060> <t3061>Why I will always play badly from now on.</t3061> <t3062>Why I will never perform well again.</t3062><t3063>”</t3063>
<t3064>The young man shrugged.</t3064> <t3065>“You must be sick.</t3065> <t3066>You shouldn't go on stage when you're sick.</t3066> <t3067>You're making a fool of yourself.</t3067> <t3068>My friends got bored.</t3068> <t3069>I got bored too.</t3069><t3070>”</t3070>
<t3071>The girl seemed not to be listening to him.</t3071> <t3072>It was as if she had undergone a transformation from joy.</t3072> <t3073>She was in a state of euphoria.</t3073>
<t3074>“Dorian, Dorian!” she cried softly.</t3074> <t3075>“Before I knew you, the only reality in my life was my play on the stage.</t3075> <t3076>I only lived when I was on stage.</t3076> <t3077>All the plays were real in my eyes.</t3077> <t3078>One night I was Rosalind, the next night Portia.</t3078> <t3079>Beatrice’s joy was my joy, Cordelia’s sorrows were my sorrows.</t3079> <t3080>I believed in everything.</t3080> <t3081>Alongside me, those rough people who appeared on stage seemed like gods to me.</t3081> <t3082>The painted sets were my world.</t3082> <t3083>I knew nothing but shadows, and I thought shadows were real.</t3083> <t3084>Then you came, my beautiful lover...</t3084> <t3085>You freed my soul from its prison.</t3085> <t3086>You taught me the true reality.</t3086> <t3087>Tonight, for the first time, I saw the hollowness, the artificiality, the stupidity of this empty show I had been acting in all my life.</t3087> <t3088>Tonight, I saw for the first time that Romeo was hideous, old, painted, and that the moonlight hitting the orchard was not real: The words I had to say were false, they were not my words, not what I wanted to say.</t3088> <t3089>I saw this tonight.</t3089> <t3090>You had given me something higher, something that all art is but a reflection of.</t3090> <t3091>You taught me what love really is, my lover, my lover!</t3091> <t3092>Sweet Prince! Prince of Life! I am tired of shadows now.</t3092> <t3093>You are more important to me than all art, forever.</t3093> <t3094>What do I have to do with puppets in a play?</t3094> <t3095>When I went on stage tonight, at first I couldn’t understand how the old enthusiasm had vanished.</t3095> <t3096>I thought I would be marvelous.</t3096> <t3097>I saw that I could do nothing.</t3097> <t3098>Then suddenly, I understood everything.</t3098> <t3099>And knowing this thrilled me with joy.</t3099> <t3100>I heard their boos, I smiled.</t3100> <t3101>What did they know of a love like ours?</t3101> <t3102>Take me away, Dorian!</t3102> <t3103>Take me to a place where we can be alone.</t3103> <t3104>I am disgusted with the stage.</t3104> <t3105>I might be able to mimic a passion I have never known, but I cannot mimic a passion that burns me like fire.</t3105> <t3106>Dorian, Dorian, now you understand, don’t you, the importance of everything?</t3106> <t3107>To play the role of a lover on stage would be like blasphemy for me, even if I could do it.</t3107> <t3108>You showed me this.</t3108><t3109>”</t3109>
<t3110>The young man threw himself onto the couch and turned his head to the other side.</t3110> <t3111>"You killed my love," he muttered.</t3111>
<t3112>The girl laughed, looking at him as if she didn't understand.</t3112> <t3113>Dorian did not respond.</t3113> <t3114>The girl came over and stroked his hair with her tiny hands.</t3114> <t3115>She knelt down and pressed his hands to her lips.</t3115> <t3116>Dorian pulled his hands away, a shiver ran through his body.</t3116>
<t3117>Then, she sprang up and walked to the door.</t3117> <t3118>“Yes,” she shouted.</t3118> <t3119>“You killed my love.</t3119> <t3120>You used to nourish my imagination.</t3120> <t3121>Now you can't even arouse my curiosity.</t3121> <t3122>You don't affect me in the slightest.</t3122> <t3123>If I loved you, it was because you were magnificent; you had superior talent, mental strength, you realized the dreams of great poets, gave shape to the shadow of art, and added concreteness.</t3123> <t3124>You threw all of that away.</t3124> <t3125>You are shallow and stupid.</t3125> <t3126>My God! What madness it was to love you!</t3126> <t3127>How foolish I was!</t3127> <t3128>Now you are nothing in my eyes.</t3128> <t3129>I will never see you again, never think of you.</t3129> <t3130>I will never utter your name.</t3130> <t3131>You don't know what you used to be in my eyes.</t3131> <t3132>And I...</t3132> <t3133>Oh, I can't even bear to think about it!</t3133> <t3134>I wish I had never seen you!</t3134> <t3135>You ruined the great love of my life.</t3135> <t3136>If love ruins your art, it means you don't know love at all!</t3136> <t3137>Without your art, you are nothing.</t3137> <t3138>I was going to make you famous, brilliant, magnificent.</t3138> <t3139>The world would have knelt before you, and you would have borne my name.</t3139> <t3140>What are you now?</t3140> <t3141>A beautiful-faced, third-rate actress.</t3141><t3142>”</t3142>
<t3143>The girl turned completely pale and was trembling.</t3143> <t3144>She clasped her hands together and murmured with a voice caught in her throat, "You're not serious, are you, Dorian?"</t3144> <t3145>"You're acting.</t3145><t3146>"</t3146>
<t3147>The young man replied in a bitter voice, "Acting?</t3147> <t3148>I'll leave that to you," he responded.</t3148> <t3149>"You do it so well!</t3149><t3150>"</t3150>
<t3151>Sibyl rose from where she had knelt; there was an expression on her face that showed she was in pain.</t3151> <t3152>She placed her hand on his and looked into his eyes.</t3152>
<t3153>Dorian pushed him.</t3153> <t3154>“Don't touch me!” he shouted.</t3154>
<t3155>The young girl, from whose lips a faint moan escaped, threw herself at Dorian's feet and lay there like a bruised flower.</t3155>
<t3156>“Dorian, don't leave me, Dorian!” she whispered.</t3156> <t3157>“I am so sorry for not giving a good performance.</t3157> <t3158>I was always thinking of you.</t3158> <t3159>But I will try, believe me, I will try.</t3159> <t3160>The love I feel for you caught me so off guard.</t3160> <t3161>If you hadn't kissed me, if we hadn't kissed, I think I would never have known love.</t3161> <t3162>Kiss me again, my love.</t3162> <t3163>Don't leave me, I can't bear it.</t3163> <t3164>Please, don't leave me.</t3164> <t3165>My brother...</t3165> <t3166>No, never mind.</t3166> <t3167>He wasn't serious, he was pretending.</t3167> <t3168>But you, oh, can't you forgive me just for tonight?</t3168> <t3169>I will work so hard on my roles, I will strive to be better.</t3169> <t3170>Please, don't be cruel to me, because I love you more than anything in the world.</t3170> <t3171>After all, I only disappointed you once.</t3171> <t3172>Still, you are very right, Dorian.</t3172> <t3173>I should have expressed my art.</t3173> <t3174>I acted foolishly but I couldn't help it.</t3174> <t3175>Please, don't leave me, don't leave me.”</t3175> <t3176>The girl, her breath choked with sobs, curled up on the ground like a wounded animal.</t3176>
<t3177>Dorian was looking down at her with those beautiful eyes, his lips, which resembled something drawn with a pen, curved in an elegant disdain.</t3177> <t3178>There is always something that seems ridiculous to us in the emotions of people we no longer love.</t3178> <t3179>Dorian now found something laughably melodramatic in Sibyl's behavior, and he was irritated by her tears and sobs.</t3179>
<t3180>Finally, "I'm leaving," he said in a calm, clear voice.</t3180> <t3181>"I don't want to be hurtful, but I can't see you again.</t3181> <t3182>You have disappointed me.</t3182><t3183>"</t3183>
<t3184>The girl was crying silently.</t3184> <t3185>She didn't respond but approached him quietly.</t3185> <t3186>She had opened her tiny hands, as if she was searching for him.</t3186> <t3187>Dorian turned on his heel and walked out.</t3187> <t3188>A few minutes later, he had already left the theater.</t3188>
<t3189>He was not quite aware of where he was going.</t3189> <t3190>Later, he would remember passing through dim streets, the dark shadows of bare arches, and in front of ominous-looking houses.</t3190> <t3191>Women with hoarse voices and harsh laughter had called out after him.</t3191> <t3192>Drunkards, muttering and cursing to themselves like giant monkeys, had stumbled past him.</t3192> <t3193>He had seen strange children crouched in doorways, and heard cries and curses rising from gloomy courtyards.</t3193>
<t3194>At dawn, he found himself near Covent Garden.</t3194> <t3195>The darkness had lifted, and the sky, illuminated by pale glimmers, had gathered into a perfect pearl.</t3195> <t3196>Along the bright-stoned, empty street, large carts loaded with lilies were slowly clattering forward.</t3196> <t3197>The air seemed to be drowsy with the scent of lilies.</t3197> <t3198>The beauty of the flowers felt like a balm to the young boy's suffering.</t3198> <t3199>Dorian walked to the marketplace following the carts, watching the men unload their cargo.</t3199> <t3200>A carter in a white, ruffled shirt offered him a handful of cherries.</t3200> <t3201>Dorian thanked him, reluctantly starting to eat the cherries, not understanding why the man didn't take any money.</t3201> <t3202>The cherries had been picked at night, with the frost of the moonlight seeping into them.</t3202> <t3203>A line of tall boys carrying crates full of striped tulips and red and yellow roses on their shoulders paraded in front of Dorian, making their way through the high, emerald green heaps of vegetables.</t3203> <t3204>Under the archway with sun-bleached gray pillars, a crowd of girls, dressed in ragged clothes and bareheaded, were waiting for the auction to end.</t3204> <t3205>Some had piled up in front of the swinging door of the café in the Piazza.</t3205> <t3206>There were carters who had fallen asleep on top of the piles of sacks.</t3206> <t3207>The hefty cart horses stumbled on the cobblestones, their saddles shaking and bells jingling as they staggered.</t3207> <t3208>Pigeons with purple necks and pink feet were running around, pecking at the seeds on the ground.</t3208>
<t3209>After a while, Dorian hailed a carriage and went home.</t3209> <t3210>He lingered on the threshold for a few minutes, gazing at the closed shutters and vacant-looking windows of the silent square.</t3210> <t3211>The sky was now a pure opal, and the rooftops of the houses gleamed like silver.</t3211> <t3212>A thin plume of smoke was rising from a chimney across the way.</t3212> <t3213>The smoke curled through the pearly air like a lilac ribbon.</t3213>
<t3214>The house's oak-paneled, spacious entrance hall had a large, gilded Venetian chandelier –a spoil taken from a Doge's ship– whose three lamps were still flickering with trembling flames: They resembled three thin leaves of fire surrounded by white heat.</t3214> <t3215>Dorian threw his coat and hat onto the table, extinguished the lamps, and headed to the bedroom through the library.</t3215> <t3216>This room on the ground floor, an octagonal, spacious section, was decorated by Dorian according to his own taste, with a newly awakened penchant for ostentation.</t3216> <t3217>He had hung Renaissance-style, varied tapestries on the walls, which had been found in an unused attic on Selby Street.</t3217>
<t3218>Just as he was turning the door handle, his eyes fell on the portrait painted by Basil Hallward.</t3218> <t3219>The young man recoiled as if startled.</t3219> <t3220>Then, with his eyebrows slightly furrowed, he entered the bedroom.</t3220> <t3221>After removing his collar, he seemed to hesitate for a moment.</t3221> <t3222>Finally, he turned back again, approached, and examined the portrait.</t3222> <t3223>In the dim light barely seeping through the cream-colored silk curtains, the face in the portrait seemed to have changed a bit.</t3223> <t3224>The expression looked different.</t3224> <t3225>There was a slight cruelty in the set of the mouth.</t3225> <t3226>It was truly a strange thing.</t3226>
<t3227>Dorian turned and went to the window, lifting the blind.</t3227> <t3228>The bright dawn light flooded the room, pushing the ghostly shadows into the corners, where they shivered and shrank, remaining there.</t3228> <t3229>However, the strange expression that Dorian thought he saw on the portrait's face remained, and it could even be said that it had become more pronounced.</t3229> <t3230>The trembling, exuberant sunlight showed Dorian the merciless lines at the corners of the mouth, as clear as if he were looking into a mirror after committing a terrible deed.</t3230>
<t3231>The young man flinched and blinked his eyes.</t3231> <t3232>He took an oval mirror surrounded by ivory Cupids, one of Lord Henry's numerous gifts, from the table and anxiously looked into its reflective depths.</t3232> <t3233>There was no such line that disfigured his red lips!</t3233> <t3234>What did this mean?</t3234>
<t3235>Dorian rubbed his eyes, moved closer, and examined the portrait again.</t3235> <t3236>There was no sign of any change when he looked at the picture, yet the entire expression of the face had unmistakably altered.</t3236> <t3237>It had not seemed so to him.</t3237> <t3238>The frightening change was visibly apparent.</t3238>
<t3239>Dorian dropped himself into a chair and began to think.</t3239> <t3240>Suddenly, the words he had spoken in Basil Hallward's studio on the day the portrait was finished came to his mind.</t3240> <t3241>Yes, he remembered them clearly.</t3241> <t3242>He had made a wild wish that he might stay young while the portrait grew old; that his own beauty might never fade, and that the burden of his passions and sins might be borne by the face on the canvas; that the lines of thought and suffering might be etched onto that painted face while he kept the delicate freshness of his newly perceived youth.</t3242> <t3243>But that wish couldn't have come true, could it?</t3243> <t3244>Such things were impossible.</t3244> <t3245>Even thinking about it was irrational.</t3245> <t3246>Yet there was the picture before his eyes, with that cruel expression on its lips.</t3246>
<t3247>Is he cruel?</t3247> <t3248>Had he acted cruelly?</t3248> <t3249>The fault was with the girl, not him.</t3249> <t3250>He had imagined Sibyl as a great artist, and because he saw her as great, he had given her his love.</t3250> <t3251>Then the girl had disappointed him.</t3251> <t3252>She had behaved in a shallow manner unworthy of his love.</t3252> <t3253>Still, when he thought of the girl sobbing at his feet like a child, an endless feeling of regret arose within Dorian.</t3253> <t3254>He remembered how heartlessly he had watched her!</t3254> <t3255>Why was he created this way?</t3255> <t3256>Why was such a soul given to him?</t3256> <t3257>But he had suffered too.</t3257> <t3258>During those three terrible hours of the play, who knows how many centuries of agony, how many eternities of torment he had lived through.</t3258> <t3259>His own life was worth as much as hers.</t3259> <t3260>If he had wounded Sibyl for a while, Sibyl had also cast a shadow over his life for a moment.</t3260> <t3261>Besides, women were more prone to suffering than men.</t3261> <t3262>They thrived on their emotions.</t3262> <t3263>They only thought about their feelings.</t3263> <t3264>They took lovers just to have someone at hand, to share mutual experiences.</t3264> <t3265>Lord Henry had told him this, and Lord Henry knew what women were like.</t3265> <t3266>Why should Dorian trouble his sweet self over Sibyl Vane?</t3266> <t3267>The girl was now nothing in his eyes.</t3267>
<t3268>Well, what about the painting?</t3268> <t3269>What should be said about the painting then?</t3269> <t3270>This portrait was hiding the secret of his life, telling his story.</t3270> <t3271>It had taught him to love his own beauty.</t3271> <t3272>Was it now going to teach him to loathe his own soul?</t3272> <t3273>Would Dorian be able to look at this painting again?</t3273>
<t3274>No, no; the issue was merely an illusion created by his tense nerves.</t3274> <t3275>The dreadful night he had experienced had left behind phantoms.</t3275> <t3276>Suddenly, that tiny red mole that drives people crazy had fallen into his mind.</t3276> <t3277>Otherwise, the portrait had not changed.</t3277> <t3278>Thinking this way was madness.</t3278>
<t3279>But see, the portrait was watching him, with its beautiful, flawed face, with its cruel mouth.</t3279> <t3280>Its hair was shining in the early light of the morning, and its blue eyes were touching his.</t3280> <t3281>Dorian was filled with an infinite pity; not for himself, but for that painted image.</t3281> <t3282>The image had already undergone a change, and it would undergo more.</t3282> <t3283>Its golden hair would fade and turn gray.</t3283> <t3284>The red and white roses would wither.</t3284> <t3285>Every sin he committed would mar and ruin the beauty of the portrait with a stain.</t3285> <t3286>But no, Dorian would not sin.</t3286> <t3287>Whether the picture changed or not, it would be the visible symbol of his conscience.</t3287> <t3288>Dorian would not succumb to the devil.</t3288> <t3289>He would not meet with Lord Henry anymore.</t3289> <t3290>At least, he would close his ears to those insidious, poisonous ideas that had awakened passions for impossible things when he first heard them in Basil Hallward's garden.</t3290> <t3291>He would return to Sibyl Vane, make amends, marry her, and try to love her again.</t3291> <t3292>Yes, it was his duty to do these things.</t3292> <t3293>Sibyl must have suffered more than he had.</t3293> <t3294>Poor little child!</t3294> <t3295>Dorian had been selfish and had acted heartlessly towards her.</t3295> <t3296>The magic he found in her would surely return.</t3296> <t3297>They would be happy together.</t3297> <t3298>Dorian would lead a beautiful, pure life with her.</t3298>
<t3299>He stood up and drew a large screen right in front of the portrait.</t3299> <t3300>He shuddered when his eyes fell upon the painting.</t3300> <t3301>“How dreadful!” he murmured as he walked and opened the glass door.</t3301> <t3302>He took a deep breath as he stepped onto the grass.</t3302> <t3303>It was as if the fresh morning air had driven away all his dark feelings.</t3303> <t3304>Now he was thinking only of Sibyl.</t3304> <t3305>He felt as if he could hear a faint echo of his old love.</t3305> <t3306>He began to repeat Sibyl’s name.</t3306> <t3307>The birds singing in the dew-damp garden were singing Sibyl’s song to the flowers.</t3307>
<t3308>Eighth chapter</t3308>
<t3309>When Dorian woke up, it was already well past noon.</t3309> <t3310>His servant had tiptoed into the room several times to see if he had woken up, wondering why the young master was sleeping so late.</t3310> <t3311>Finally, the bell rang.</t3311> <t3312>Victor entered softly.</t3312> <t3313>On the antique Sèvres porcelain tray in his hand were a cup of tea and a stack of letters.</t3313> <t3314>He opened the olive-colored curtains lined with shimmering blue that covered the room's three tall windows.</t3314>
<t3315>“Monsieur slept well this morning,” he said with a smile.</t3315>
<t3316>Dorian asked sleepily, "What time is it, Victor?"</t3316>
<t3317>“An hour and a quarter, monsieur.</t3317><t3318>”</t3318>
<t3319>But it was already late, huh!</t3319> <t3320>Dorian sat up, took a few sips of tea, and then picked up his letters.</t3320> <t3321>One of them was from Lord Henry; it had been delivered by hand that morning.</t3321> <t3322>The young man hesitated for a moment, then put the letter aside.</t3322> <t3323>He opened the others reluctantly.</t3323> <t3324>As usual during the season, it was a pile consisting of calling cards, dinner invitations, private show tickets, and charity concert programs that rained down on the heads of young socialites.</t3324> <t3325>There was also a rather hefty bill for a silver Louis Quinze dressing set with embossed inlays, which he had not yet dared to forward to his guardians.</t3325> <t3326>His guardians were so narrow-minded that they couldn't understand that in this day and age, people only needed unnecessary things!</t3326> <t3327>There were also many letters written with great respect from pawnbrokers and moneylenders on Jermyn Street.</t3327> <t3328>They were offering Dorian as much money as he wanted, at the most favorable interest rates, whenever he desired.</t3328>
<t3329>About ten minutes later, Dorian got out of bed, put on a luxurious kimono made of wool cashmere embroidered with silk, and went to the bathroom covered in veined black onyx.</t3329> <t3330>After the long sleep he had, the cool water refreshed him.</t3330> <t3331>It was as if he had forgotten all the troubles he had endured.</t3331> <t3332>Although a vague feeling of having played a role in a strange tragedy crossed his mind a few times, it had the baselessness of a dream.</t3332>
<t3333>As soon as Dorian dressed, he went to the library and had a light French-style breakfast at the small, round table set in front of the open glass door.</t3333> <t3334>It was a splendid day.</t3334> <t3335>The warm air seemed to be laden with spices.</t3335> <t3336>A bee flew in and buzzed around the vase with blue dragons, filled with sulfur-yellow roses, that stood in front of Dorian.</t3336> <t3337>Dorian felt pure happiness within him.</t3337>
<t3338>When his eyes suddenly caught the screen placed in front of the portrait, the young man was startled.</t3338>
<t3339>As the boy placed an omelet on the table, he asked, "Did the weather feel chilly to Monsieur?"</t3339> <t3340>"I'm closing the window.</t3340><t3341>"</t3341>
<t3342>Shaking his head, Dorian murmured, "I'm not cold."</t3342>
<t3343>Were the memories real?</t3343> <t3344>Had the portrait truly undergone a change?</t3344> <t3345>Or was it merely his own imagination that led him to see an expression of treachery where once there had been an expression of pride?</t3345> <t3346>A painted canvas certainly couldn't change, could it?</t3346> <t3347>This was ridiculous.</t3347> <t3348>He now had a story he could tell Basil one day.</t3348> <t3349>Basil would smile when he heard it.</t3349>
<t3350>On the other hand, how vivid was the memory of this event!</t3350> <t3351>First in the dimness of twilight, then in the bright dawn light, Dorian had seen the stone-hearted expression on those tense lips.</t3351> <t3352>Now the young man was almost terrified of his servant going outside.</t3352> <t3353>Because he knew that when he was alone, he wouldn't be able to resist examining the portrait.</t3353> <t3354>He was afraid of gaining definite knowledge.</t3354> <t3355>When the servant brought the coffee and cigarettes and was about to leave, Dorian was seized by a frantic desire to keep him.</t3355> <t3356>Just as the door was closing, he called the man back.</t3356> <t3357>The servant stopped, waiting for orders.</t3357>
<t3358>Dorian looked at her.</t3358> <t3359>Then, sighing, he said, "Whoever calls, I'm not home, Victor."</t3359>
<t3360>The man bent down, then withdrew.</t3360>
<t3361>Then Dorian got up from the table, lit a cigarette, and threw himself onto a sofa with plenty of cushions opposite the screen.</t3361> <t3362>The screen was very old, made of gilded Spanish leather, and adorned with a somewhat ostentatious Louis Quatorze pattern.</t3362> <t3363>As Dorian gazed at the screen curiously, he wondered if it had ever shielded the secret of a human life before.</t3363>
<t3364>Should he pull the screen aside despite everything?</t3364> <t3365>But why not leave it where it is?</t3365> <t3366>What good would it do to know?</t3366> <t3367>If what he remembered was true, it was something terrifying.</t3367> <t3368>If it wasn't true, why upset himself?</t3368> <t3369>On the other hand, what if by some horrible coincidence, other eyes besides his own looked behind the screen and saw that dreadful change?</t3369> <t3370>What could Dorian do if Basil Hallward came and wanted to look at his own painting?</t3370> <t3371>Basil would certainly do this one day.</t3371> <t3372>No, no, the painting needed to be examined immediately, right now.</t3372> <t3373>It was preferable to this terrible tension caused by doubt.</t3373>
<t3374>Dorian stood up and locked both doors.</t3374> <t3375>He had to be alone at least while looking at the mask of his shame.</t3375> <t3376>Dorian drew the screen and came face to face with himself.</t3376> <t3377>Everything was completely real: The portrait had changed.</t3377>
<t3378>He scrutinized the portrait with an almost scientific interest.</t3378> <t3379>He would later recall this action with surprise.</t3379> <t3380>It was beyond his comprehension that such a transformation had taken place.</t3380> <t3381>Yet, the transformation was real, it existed, it was there.</t3381> <t3382>Was there a hidden connection between the chemical atoms that came together on the canvas to form color and shape and the soul within Dorian?</t3382> <t3383>Was it possible for those atoms to grasp the thoughts of this soul?</t3383> <t3384>Or was there another, more terrifying reason?</t3384> <t3385>The young man shuddered, frightened, and went back to the couch, lying down and fixing his eyes on the painting with a consuming horror.</t3385>
<t3386>Gene de bu işin ona bir yararı dokunduğunu düşünüyordu: Sibyl Vane’e ne kadar haksız ve acımasız davrandığını kafasına dank ettirmişti.</t3386> <t3387>Bu zalimliği onarmak için iş işten geçmiş değildi.</t3387> <t3388>Sibyl’le hâlâ evlenebilirdi.</t3388> <t3389>Gerçek olmayan ve bencil aşkı daha yüce bir ruh haline geçit verebilir, daha soylu bir tutkuya dönüşebilir; Basil Hallward’ın yapmış olduğu portre Dorian’a ömür boyu yol gösterebilirdi.</t3389> <t3390>Kimileri için sofuluk, kimileri için vicdan ve hepimiz için Tanrı korkusu neyse, bu resim de Dorian için o olabilirdi.</t3390> <t3391>Vicdan azabına karşı uyuşturucu maddeler vardı, ahlak duyusunu uykuya daldırtabilen ilaçlar...</t3391> <t3392>Ama işte şu karşıdaki, günahın alçaltıcı etkisinin gözle görülür bir simgesiydi.</t3392> <t3393>İnsanoğlunun kendi ruhunda yarattığı çöküşün elle tutulur bir göstergesi.</t3393>
<t3394>The clock struck three, then four, the double chimes of the half-hours were heard, but Dorian Gray did not move.</t3394> <t3395>He was trying to weave the crimson threads of life together to create a pattern, to find a way out of this blood-colored labyrinth of passion in which he wandered.</t3395> <t3396>He had no idea what to do or what to think.</t3396> <t3397>Finally, he sat down at the table and wrote a passionate letter to the girl he loved, asking for forgiveness and accusing himself of madness.</t3397> <t3398>He filled many pages one after another with words of sorrow and even more frenzied words expressing his pain.</t3398> <t3399>Self-reproach is a satisfying luxury.</t3399> <t3400>When we blame ourselves, it feels as if no one else has the right to blame us.</t3400> <t3401>It is the confession itself that purifies a person from sin, not the confessor priest.</t3401> <t3402>When Dorian finished the letter, he felt he had been forgiven.</t3402>
<t3403>Suddenly, there was a knock on the door, Dorian heard Lord Henry's voice from outside: "My dear, I need to see you.</t3403> <t3404>Open this door at once.</t3404> <t3405>I can't stand you shutting yourself in like this.</t3405><t3406>"</t3406>
<t3407>Dorian stood motionless, giving no response.</t3407> <t3408>The blows did not stop; they grew even more intense.</t3408> <t3409>Yes, it was better to let Lord Henry in, to tell him about the brand new life he was going to lead, to argue if necessary, and to part ways if separation became inevitable.</t3409> <t3410>Dorian jumped up and hurriedly pulled the screen in front of the painting, then unlocked the door.</t3410>
<t3411>Lord Henry entered, saying, "I am very sorry about what happened, Dorian."</t3411> <t3412>"But don't worry too much about it.</t3412><t3413>"</t3413>
<t3414>The child asked, "Do you mean the matter of Sibyl Vane?"</t3414>
<t3415>Lord Henry, "Yes, of course," he said, sinking into a chair and slowly starting to remove his yellow gloves.</t3415> <t3416>"It's a terrible thing in a way, but it wasn't your fault.</t3416> <t3417>Tell me, did you go backstage and see her after the play was over?</t3417><t3418>"</t3418>
<t3419>“Yes.</t3419><t3420>”</t3420>
<t3421>“I had guessed it would be like this too.</t3421> <t3422>Did you fight with him?</t3422><t3423>”</t3423>
<t3424>“Like an animal, Harry, literally like an animal.</t3424> <t3425>But everything is fine now.</t3425> <t3426>I'm very sorry for what happened.</t3426> <t3427>It taught me to know myself much better.</t3427><t3428>”</t3428>
<t3429>"Dorian, I'm so glad you're approaching the matter this way!</t3429> <t3430>I thought I would find you buried in guilt, tearing out those lovely curly locks of yours.</t3430><t3431>"</t3431>
<t3432>Dorian shook his head, smiling, "I have overcome all of them."</t3432> <t3433>"Now I am truly happy.</t3433> <t3434>Let me say first that I now know what conscience is.</t3434> <t3435>It is not what you said.</t3435> <t3436>It is the most divine part of our being.</t3436> <t3437>Don't sneer, Harry; at least not in my presence.</t3437> <t3438>I want to be a good person.</t3438> <t3439>I cannot bear my soul becoming ugly and horrible.</t3439><t3440>"</t3440>
<t3441>“Dorian, what a delightful and artistic basis for ethics this is!</t3441> <t3442>Congratulations for thinking of it.</t3442> <t3443>So, how will you start this?</t3443><t3444>”</t3444>
<t3445>“By marrying Sibyl Vane.</t3445><t3446>”</t3446>
<t3447>“Marrying Sibyl Vane?” said Lord Henry, jumping up from his seat and staring at the boy in astonishment as if he hadn't understood what he had just heard.</t3447>
<t3448>“Yes, Harry, I know what you're going to say.</t3448> <t3449>Marriage is something that ruins everything!</t3449> <t3450>Don't say it.</t3450> <t3451>Never say such things to me again.</t3451> <t3452>Two days ago, I asked Sibyl Vane to marry me.</t3452> <t3453>I will not go back on my word.</t3453> <t3454>She will be my wife.</t3454><t3455>”</t3455>
<t3456>“Is it you! Dorian!..</t3456> <t3457>Didn't you get my letter?</t3457> <t3458>I wrote it this morning and sent it with my own man.</t3458><t3459>”</t3459>
<t3460>“Your letter?</t3460> <t3461>Oh yes! I hadn't read it yet, Harry.</t3461> <t3462>I was afraid you might have written something I wouldn't like.</t3462> <t3463>You always dissect life bit by bit with your aphorisms.</t3463><t3464>”</t3464>
<t3465>“So, you don't know anything at all?</t3465><t3466>”</t3466>
<t3467>"What do you mean?</t3467><t3468>"</t3468>
<t3469>Lord Henry came, sat down beside Dorian, and took both of his hands in his own, holding them tightly.</t3469> <t3470>“Dorian,” he said.</t3470> <t3471>“In my letter...</t3471> <t3472>don't be afraid...</t3472> <t3473>I informed you of Sibyl Vane’s death.</t3473><t3474>”</t3474>
<t3475>Dorian leapt to his feet with a bitter cry escaping his lips, pulling his hands away from Lord Henry's grasp.</t3475> <t3476>“Death! Sibyl is dead?</t3476> <t3477>That can't be true!</t3477> <t3478>It's a filthy lie!</t3478> <t3479>How dare you say such a thing?</t3479><t3480>”</t3480>
<t3481>Lord Henry said with a serious tone, "That's right, Dorian," he said. "All the morning newspapers are writing about it.</t3481> <t3482>I wrote to you so that you wouldn't see anyone until I arrived.</t3482> <t3483>There will inevitably be an investigation, but you must not get involved.</t3483> <t3484>Such things make a person sought after in Paris.</t3484> <t3485>However, the people of London are so narrow-minded!</t3485> <t3486>It's not good to take your first step into society here with a scandal.</t3486> <t3487>You should save the scandals and use them to be interesting in your old age.</t3487> <t3488>I suppose the people at the theater don't know your name, do they?</t3488> <t3489>If they don't, there's no problem.</t3489> <t3490>Did anyone see you go to his room?</t3490> <t3491>This point is very important.</t3491><t3492>"</t3492>
<t3493>Dorian did not respond for a while.</t3493> <t3494>He was stunned with horror.</t3494> <t3495>Finally, in a hoarse voice, he stammered, “Harry,”</t3495> <t3496>“Did you say an inquiry?</t3496> <t3497>What do you mean by that?</t3497> <t3498>Or is it Sibyl?..</t3498> <t3499>Oh, Harry, I can't stand it! Hurry up.</t3499> <t3500>Tell me everything, right now.</t3500><t3501>”</t3501>
<t3502>"I have no doubt that the death was not an accident, Dorian; however, she told everyone while leaving the theater that she had forgotten something upstairs.</t3502> <t3503>They waited for a while, but she didn't come down.</t3503> <t3504>Then they found her in the dressing room, lying on the floor, lifeless.</t3504> <t3505>She accidentally swallowed something, something terrible used in the theater.</t3505> <t3506>I don't know what it was, but it contained either prussic acid or white lead, which caused the poor girl to die immediately.</t3506><t3507>"</t3507>
<t3508>The young man shouted, "Harry, Harry, this is horrible!"</t3508> <t3509>"Yes, yes, it's a very tragic thing, you shouldn't get involved in this.</t3509> <t3510>According to what I read in the Standard, he was seventeen years old.</t3510> <t3511>If you asked me, I would have said he was even younger.</t3511> <t3512>He looked so childish, so ignorant about acting!</t3512> <t3513>Dorian, don't let this upset your nerves.</t3513> <t3514>Come, have dinner with me, and then we can check out the opera.</t3514> <t3515>It's Patti's night tonight, which means everyone will be there.</t3515> <t3516>You can come to my sister's box.</t3516> <t3517>There will be very modern ladies with you.</t3517><t3518>"</t3518>
<t3519>Dorian, somewhat to himself, said, "So I killed Sibyl Vane."</t3519><t3520>"I killed her as surely as if I had cut her little throat with a knife."</t3520><t3521>"Yet the beauty of the roses has not lessened because I killed her."</t3521><t3522>"The birds are singing in my garden just as happily."</t3522><t3523>"And tonight, I will dine with you and go to the opera, and then we will probably have supper somewhere."</t3523><t3524>"How dramatic life is!"</t3524><t3525>"Harry, if I had read all this in a book, I would undoubtedly have cried."</t3525><t3526>"But now that it has actually happened, everything seems so extraordinary that I cannot shed a tear."</t3526><t3527>"Look, here is the first passionate love letter I have ever written."</t3527><t3528>"How strange that my first passionate love letter is written to a dead girl!"</t3528><t3529>"Do they have feelings, those silent, white beings we call the dead?"</t3529><t3530>"Oh, Sibyl! Can she feel, can she know, can she listen?"</t3530><t3531>"Oh, Harry, how I loved her once!"</t3531><t3532>"It feels like it was years ago now."</t3532><t3533>"She was everything to me."</t3533><t3534>"Then that terrible night happened..."</t3534><t3535>"Was it really last night..."</t3535><t3536>"Sibyl acted very badly, and my heart was almost shattered."</t3536><t3537>"Sibyl told me everything."</t3537><t3538>"It was extremely touching, but it did not move my heart at all."</t3538><t3539>"I found her shallow."</t3539><t3540>"Then suddenly something happened that frightened me."</t3540><t3541>"I cannot tell you what it was, but it was terrible."</t3541><t3542>"I decided to go back to Sibyl."</t3542><t3543>"I thought I had wronged her."</t3543><t3544>"And now she is dead."</t3544><t3545>"Oh, God, great God! Harry, what am I going to do now?"</t3545><t3546>"You don't know how much danger I am in; there is no one to keep me on the right path."</t3546><t3547>"She would have done that for me."</t3547><t3548>"She had no right to kill herself."</t3548><t3549>"She was very selfish indeed."</t3549><t3550>"</t3550>
<t3551>Lord Henry took a cigarette from the table, pulled out a gold-plated matchbox, and said, "My dear Dorian."</t3551> <t3552>"There is only one way for a woman to reform a man: She bores him so much that he becomes utterly disenchanted with life.</t3552> <t3553>If you had married this girl, you would have been terribly unhappy.</t3553> <t3554>You would have taken good care of her, naturally.</t3554> <t3555>Yet she would soon realize that you were completely indifferent to her.</t3555> <t3556>When women learn of their husband's indifference, they either become utterly neglected and unkempt or start parading around in very chic hats that another woman has made her husband notice.</t3556> <t3557>I'm not even mentioning the social mistake of such a marriage.</t3557> <t3558>I would never have allowed such a thing, of course, but believe me, this would not have worked out in any way.</t3558><t3559>"</t3559>
<t3560>The child said, "It probably wouldn't have worked."</t3560> <t3561>He was pacing up and down the room; his face was terribly pale.</t3561> <t3562>"But I considered this my duty.</t3562> <t3563>If this terrible tragedy prevented me from doing what I believed was right, it's not my fault.</t3563> <t3564>I remember you once said that there is a curse in good intentions, they always come too late.</t3564> <t3565>My good intention indeed came too late.</t3565><t3566>"</t3566>
<t3567>“Good intentions are futile attempts to interfere with scientific rules.</t3567> <t3568>Their starting point is pure arrogance, and their results amount to a big zero.</t3568> <t3569>From time to time, they allow us to experience the luxury of some barren yet pleasurable emotions, which can be quite appealing to weak individuals.</t3569> <t3570>This is the only positive thing that can be said about good intentions.</t3570> <t3571>Good intentions are nothing more than a check written on an account at a bank where people have not deposited any money.</t3571><t3572>”</t3572>
<t3573>Dorian Gray said, "Harry," as he sat down next to his friend.</t3573> <t3574>"Why can't I feel this tragedy as deeply as I want?</t3574> <t3575>Yet, I don't think I am stone-hearted.</t3575> <t3576>Do you think I am?</t3576><t3577>"</t3577>
<t3578>Lord Henry replied with that sweet, melancholy smile, "Dorian, you have done such foolish things in the last ten or fifteen days that I don't think you have the right to attribute this title to yourself."</t3578>
<t3579>Dorian frowned.</t3579> <t3580>“I don't like this explanation, Harry.</t3580> <t3581>Still, I'm glad you don't find me heartless.</t3581> <t3582>I'm not heartless at all.</t3582> <t3583>I know that.</t3583> <t3584>Yet I must admit that this event doesn't affect me as it should.</t3584> <t3585>In short, it feels like a wonderful scene, like the perfect ending of a play.</t3585> <t3586>It has the eerie beauty of an ancient Greek tragedy.</t3586> <t3587>It's as if I played a major role in this tragedy, but came out unscathed.</t3587><t3588>”</t3588>
<t3589>Lord Henry, who took great and secret pleasure in provoking the young man's unconscious selfishness, said, "This is an interesting problem, extremely interesting."</t3589><t3590>"It seems to me that the real explanation is this: Often, the real tragedies of life are so far removed from the standards of art that they hurt us with their crude violence, their inconsistencies, the absurdity of their lack of meaning, their lack of elegance and grace.</t3590><t3591>They affect us much like a crowd does.</t3591><t3592>They leave us with an impression of pure brute force, and we rebel against it.</t3592><t3593>On the other hand, occasionally, a tragedy with elements of artistic beauty enters our lives.</t3593><t3594>If these elements of beauty are genuine, the event affects us directly, in terms of its dramatic structure.</t3594><t3595>Suddenly, we find that we are no longer actors, but spectators of the play.</t3595><t3596>Or rather, we are both actors and spectators.</t3596><t3597>We watch ourselves and get carried away by the extraordinariness of the spectacle.</t3597><t3598>So what has really happened in this event?</t3598><t3599>A girl has killed herself for your love.</t3599><t3600>I wish I had experienced something like that.</t3600><t3601>It would have made me fall in love with love for a lifetime.</t3601><t3602>The people who adored me...</t3602><t3603>though they were not many in number...</t3603><t3604>always insisted on surviving long after the interest I had in them or they had in me had faded.</t3604><t3605>They became fat and tiresome people.</t3605><t3606>Whenever we met, they immediately started to revive old memories.</t3606><t3607>Ah, the terrible memory of a woman!</t3607><t3608>What a dreadful thing it is!</t3608><t3609>How it reveals the pure mossiness of the mind!</t3609><t3610>One should absorb the color of life but never remember its details.</t3610><t3611>Details are always the business of the vulgar."</t3611><t3612></t3612>
<t3613>Dorian sighed, "I should plant poppies in my garden."</t3613>
<t3614>His friend replied, "There's no need."</t3614> <t3615>"Life always has bunches of poppies in its hand.</t3615> <t3616>Sometimes certain things don't just drag on.</t3616> <t3617>Once, for an entire season, I wore a violet on my lapel: as a kind of artistic mourning for a love that simply couldn't die.</t3617> <t3618>However, in the end, the love died.</t3618> <t3619>I don't remember why it died.</t3619> <t3620>It was because the girl proposed sacrificing the whole world for my sake, if I'm not mistaken.</t3620> <t3621>That is always a dreadful moment.</t3621> <t3622>It instills a fear of eternity in one's heart.</t3622> <t3623>Anyway...</t3623> <t3624>Would you believe...</t3624> <t3625>A week ago, at a dinner at Lady Hampshire's, I found myself next to the mentioned lady...</t3625> <t3626>And the lady insisted on reliving everything, digging up the past and talking about the future.</t3626> <t3627>I had buried the love I experienced in a flower bed.</t3627> <t3628>The woman dug it up, swore that I had ruined her life.</t3628> <t3629>I must say, I wasn't worried about it because she was eating heartily at the table.</t3629> <t3630>However, what she did was so crude!</t3630> <t3631>The only charm of the past is that it is the past.</t3631> <t3632>Yet women never know when the curtain has fallen.</t3632> <t3633>They always want a sixth act; they propose to continue when the play has lost all its interest.</t3633> <t3634>If I followed them, every comedy would end in a tragic note, and every tragedy would turn into a farce.</t3634> <t3635>Women have a very endearing artificiality, but no sense of art.</t3635> <t3636>You are luckier than I am.</t3636> <t3637>I assure you, Dorian, none of the women I know would do for me what Sibyl Vane did for you.</t3637> <t3638>Ordinary women always know how to console themselves.</t3638> <t3639>Some do it by cloaking themselves in romantic colors.</t3639> <t3640>Never trust a woman who wears purple, no matter her age...</t3640> <t3641>Nor a woman over thirty-five who is fond of pink ribbons.</t3641> <t3642>It means they definitely have a history behind them.</t3642> <t3643>Some women find great solace in suddenly discovering the good qualities of their husbands.</t3643> <t3644>They flaunt their happy marriages in one's face, like the most attractive sin.</t3644> <t3645>Some are consoled by religion.</t3645> <t3646>A woman once told me that the pleasure of flirting lies in the mysteries of religion.</t3646> <t3647>I understand this very well.</t3647> <t3648>Besides, the thing that flatters one's pride the most in the world is being told, you are a sinner.</t3648> <t3649>Conscience makes us all selfish.</t3649> <t3650>Yes, the consolations women find in contemporary life are endless.</t3650> <t3651>In fact, I haven't even touched on the most important one.</t3651><t3652>"</t3652>
<t3653>The young man asked in a subdued voice, "What is that, Harry?"</t3653>
<t3654>“Dear, the most clichéd consolation.</t3654> <t3655>When a person loses their own lover, they snatch someone else's.</t3655> <t3656>In polite society, this always exonerates a woman.</t3656> <t3657>But truly, Dorian, how different this Sibyl Vane was from all the other women we know!</t3657> <t3658>There is something very beautiful in her death, I think.</t3658> <t3659>I am so happy to live in a century where such wonderful things can happen.</t3659> <t3660>These events make one believe in the truth of things like romance, passion, love, which are toys in all our hands.</t3660><t3661>”</t3661>
<t3662>“I treated him very cruelly.</t3662> <t3663>You forget this.</t3663><t3664>”</t3664>
<t3665>“I'm afraid that women know the value of cruelty, pure cruelty, more than anything else.</t3665> <t3666>Their instincts are extraordinarily primitive.</t3666> <t3667>We gave them their freedom, but they still continue to be slaves searching for their masters.</t3667> <t3668>They love to be ruled.</t3668> <t3669>I'm sure you behaved wonderfully.</t3669> <t3670>I've never seen you truly angry, but I can imagine how beautiful you would look.</t3670> <t3671>Besides, it wasn't yesterday but the day before that you told me something.</t3671> <t3672>At the time, it seemed like a figment of imagination to me, but it turns out it was completely true; now I see.</t3672> <t3673>The key to everything lies in this.</t3673><t3674>”</t3674>
<t3675>"What is it, Harry?"</t3675><t3676>"</t3676>
<t3677>"You had said that Sibyl Vane symbolized all the heroes of romantic literature in your eyes.</t3677> <t3678>One night she becomes Desdemona, the next night Ophelia, and even if she dies as Juliet, she is reborn as Imogen, you had said.</t3678><t3679>"</t3679>
<t3680>The young man buried his face in his hands and muttered, "Now it will never be reborn again."</t3680>
<t3681>“No, she will never be born into life again.</t3681> <t3682>She played her last role.</t3682> <t3683>The thing is, you should think of that poor death in the vulgar dressing room as a strange, striking scene from a seventeenth-century tragedy: an extraordinary scene taken from Webster, Ford, or Cyril Tourneur.</t3683> <t3684>The poor girl never really lived, so she never really died.</t3684> <t3685>At least in your eyes, she was always a dream, a vision that flew through Shakespeare's plays, adding more beauty to them with her presence, a reed that gave a richer, more jubilant tone to Shakespeare's music.</t3685> <t3686>But the moment this girl touched real life, she left a stain; life also damaged her, and that's why she passed away.</t3686> <t3687>Mourn for Ophelia, if you wish.</t3687> <t3688>Wear black because Cordelia was strangled.</t3688> <t3689>Rebel against God because Brabantio's daughter died.</t3689> <t3690>But do not waste your tears on Sibyl Vane.</t3690> <t3691>She was much more unreal than all these women.</t3691><t3692>”</t3692>
<t3693>There was a silence.</t3693> <t3694>The room darkened with the evening.</t3694> <t3695>It was as if silent shadows with silver feet glided in from the garden.</t3695> <t3696>Colors faded and vanished as if exhausted.</t3696>
<t3697>After a while, Dorian Gray lifted his head.</t3697> <t3698>“You have explained me to myself, Harry,” he murmured, with a sigh of relief.</t3698> <t3699>“I was feeling everything you said, but I was afraid, and then I couldn't express it.</t3699> <t3700>How well you know me!</t3700> <t3701>Anyway, we won't talk about this event anymore.</t3701> <t3702>It was a wonderful experience for me.</t3702> <t3703>That's all.</t3703> <t3704>I wonder if life has other such wonderful things in store for me?</t3704><t3705>”</t3705>
<t3706>“Life is preparing everything for you, Dorian.</t3706> <t3707>With this extraordinary beauty of yours, there is nothing you cannot do.</t3707><t3708>”</t3708>
<t3709>“But Harry, suppose I collapse, grow old, and become all wrinkled.</t3709> <t3710>What about then?</t3710><t3711>”</t3711>
<t3712>Lord Henry stood up to leave and said, "Then what?"</t3712> <t3713>"Then, dear Dorian, if you want to achieve victory, you will have to fight.</t3713> <t3714>In this situation, victories are being handed to you.</t3714> <t3715>No, no, you must preserve your beauty.</t3715> <t3716>We live in an age where everyone reads too much to be wise and thinks too much to be beautiful.</t3716> <t3717>We cannot do without you.</t3717> <t3718>Come on, it would be best if you got dressed now so we can head to the club.</t3718> <t3719>We are already late.</t3719><t3720>"</t3720>
<t3721>“Let me come and find you at the opera, Harry.</t3721> <t3722>I am very tired, I don't have the energy to eat anything.</t3722> <t3723>What is the number of your sister's box?</t3723><t3724>”</t3724>
<t3725>“Twenty-seven, I think.</t3725> <t3726>On the first floor.</t3726> <t3727>You will see the name on the door.</t3727> <t3728>I wish you could have come to dinner with me.</t3728><t3729>”</t3729>
<t3730>Dorian reluctantly said, "I don't feel like it."</t3730> <t3731>"But I am grateful to you for all that you have said.</t3731> <t3732>You really are my best friend.</t3732> <t3733>No one in the world has understood me the way you do.</t3733><t3734>"</t3734>
<t3735>Lord Henry, shaking his hand, replied, "We are just at the beginning of our friendship, Dorian."</t3735> <t3736>"Goodbye.</t3736> <t3737>Remember to come before half-past nine.</t3737> <t3738>Don't forget, Patti is singing tonight.</t3738><t3739>"</t3739>
<t3740>As he pulled the door behind him and left, Dorian rang the bell; a few minutes later, Victor came with the lamps and drew the curtains.</t3740> <t3741>Dorian waited impatiently for him to leave.</t3741> <t3742>The man seemed to prolong every task he did.</t3742>
<t3743>As soon as he left, Dorian ran and pulled the screen.</t3743> <t3744>No, there was no other change in the picture.</t3744> <t3745>So, the painting had received the news of Sibyl Vane's death before he did.</t3745> <t3746>It was learning about the events in Dorian's life as they happened.</t3746> <t3747>The cruelty that marred the beautiful line of the mouth had undoubtedly appeared the moment the poor girl drank the poison.</t3747> <t3748>Or was the portrait indifferent to the consequences?</t3748> <t3749>Was it only perceiving what was happening within the soul?</t3749> <t3750>Dorian was curious.</t3750> <t3751>He hoped that one day the change would occur before his very eyes, and while hoping, he couldn't help but shudder.</t3751>
<t3752>Poor Sibyl! What a love they had lived!</t3752> <t3753>How many times had the girl pretended to die on stage.</t3753> <t3754>Then death itself had marked her and taken her away.</t3754> <t3755>How had Sibyl played that final dreadful scene?</t3755> <t3756>Had she cursed Dorian while she was dying?</t3756> <t3757>But no, she had died for Dorian's love.</t3757> <t3758>From now on, love would always carry a sacred meaning in Dorian's eyes.</t3758> <t3759>Sibyl had sacrificed her life to pay for all sins.</t3759> <t3760>Dorian would no longer think about the torment she had endured on that terrible night in the theater.</t3760> <t3761>He would think of her as a unique, tragic symbol sent to earth to show the highest truth of love.</t3761> <t3762>A unique, tragic symbol, huh?</t3762> <t3763>When Dorian remembered her childlike appearance, her charming, dreamy manners, that shy deer-like grace, his eyes filled with tears.</t3763> <t3764>The young man quickly cleared his mind and looked at the picture again.</t3764>
<t3765>He felt that the time had come to make his choice.</t3765> <t3766>Or had it already been made?</t3766> <t3767>Yes, life had made this decision on his behalf, life and his boundless curiosity about it.</t3767> <t3768>Immortal youth, boundless passion, secret, mysterious, subtle pleasures, wild joys, even wilder sins: All these would be Dorian's.</t3768> <t3769>As for the burden of his shame, the portrait would bear it, that was all.</t3769>
<t3770>As he thought of the horrors awaiting that beautiful face on the canvas, his heart filled with pain.</t3770> <t3771>He had once kissed, or rather pretended to kiss, those painted lips that now smiled at him so cruelly, in a childish Narcissistic imitation.</t3771> <t3772>Who knows how many mornings he had stood before the painting, gazing at its beauty with admiring disbelief.</t3772> <t3773>At times, it had seemed to him as if he were almost infatuated with this painting.</t3773> <t3774>Would this painting now change according to every mood he succumbed to?</t3774> <t3775>Would it become something disgusting, horrifying, something that needed to be hidden in a locked room, away from the sun that made the gold of those exquisite, curly locks shine even brighter?</t3775> <t3776>What a pity!</t3776> <t3777>What a pity!</t3777>
<t3778>The young man thought for a moment about praying for this disgusting, terrifying connection between himself and the painting to be severed.</t3778> <t3779>The painting had changed in response to a prayer; perhaps it could remain as it was in response to another prayer.</t3779> <t3780>On the other hand, who with any knowledge of life would pass up the opportunity to stay young forever, no matter how irrational it might be, no matter what unknown consequences it might carry?</t3780> <t3781>Besides, was this really something that was within his control?</t3781> <t3782>Had his prayer truly been what caused this role reversal?</t3782> <t3783>Couldn't there be a strange scientific explanation for all these events?</t3783> <t3784>If thought could have an effect on living organisms, couldn't it also have an effect on inanimate, inorganic things?</t3784> <t3785>Moreover...</t3785> <t3786>Even without conscious desire and thought, couldn't something outside of us create vibrations in harmony with our mental states and intense emotions: the secret love of a strange affinity, the call of atom to atom?</t3786> <t3787>In any case, the reason didn't matter at all.</t3787> <t3788>From now on, Dorian would never attempt to provoke any terrible power with any wish or prayer.</t3788> <t3789>If the painting was going to change, it would change.</t3789> <t3790>That was all.</t3790> <t3791>What was the point of overthinking it?</t3791>
<t3792>Actually, observing this change would have been really enjoyable.</t3792> <t3793>Thus, Dorian would be able to delve into the most secret corners of his own mind.</t3793> <t3794>This portrait would be the most magical of mirrors for him.</t3794> <t3795>Just as it had initially laid bare his body before his eyes, now it would lay bare his soul.</t3795> <t3796>And when winter came to the portrait, he would still be living in a spring season lingering on the threshold of summer.</t3796> <t3797>When the blood drained from the portrait's face, leaving behind a pale mask with leaden eyes drawn in chalk, he would still retain the allure and charm of youth.</t3797> <t3798>Not a single flower of his beauty would wither.</t3798> <t3799>Not a single pulse of his vitality would weaken.</t3799> <t3800>He would remain robust, agile, and joyous like the gods of ancient Greece!</t3800> <t3801>What did it matter what happened to the colorful image on the canvas?</t3801> <t3802>Dorian would be safe.</t3802> <t3803>This meant everything.</t3803>
<t3804>Dorian, smiling, pulled the screen back in front of the portrait and entered the bedroom.</t3804> <t3805>His personal valet was waiting for him there.</t3805> <t3806>An hour later, Dorian Gray had arrived at the opera and taken his seat, and Lord Henry was already leaning against his chair, bending towards him.</t3806>
<t3807>Ninth chapter</t3807>
<t3808>The next morning, while Dorian was sitting at breakfast, the servant brought in Basil Hallward.</t3808>
<t3809>The painter said with a serious expression, "I'm glad I found you at home, Dorian."</t3809> <t3810>"I came yesterday evening as well, they told me you were at the opera.</t3810> <t3811>I knew that wouldn't be true, naturally.</t3811> <t3812>I wish you had told the household where you were going.</t3812> <t3813>I had a terrible night: I was almost afraid that one tragedy would follow another.</t3813> <t3814>You could have sent me a telegram when you first got the news, couldn't you?</t3814> <t3815>By chance, I saw it in the evening edition of the Globe I found at the club.</t3815> <t3816>I ran here immediately, I was very upset when I couldn't find you.</t3816> <t3817>I can't tell you how shaken I was by this event.</t3817> <t3818>Who knows how devastated you must be.</t3818> <t3819>But where were you?</t3819> <t3820>Did you go to see the girl's mother?</t3820> <t3821>For a moment, I even thought of following you there.</t3821> <t3822>The addresses were in the newspaper.</t3822> <t3823>A place on Euston Street, right?</t3823> <t3824>But I was afraid of being disrespectful to a grief I couldn't alleviate.</t3824> <t3825>Poor woman!</t3825> <t3826>Who knows how devastated she must be!</t3826> <t3827>And her only child!</t3827> <t3828>What was she saying, poor thing?</t3828><t3829>"</t3829>
<t3830>Dorian grumbled, "Dear Basil, how should I know?"</t3830> <t3831>He was drinking a pale yellow wine from a thin glass made of Venetian glass, resembling golden essence, and he looked extremely bored.</t3831> <t3832>"I was at the opera.</t3832> <t3833>You should have come there.</t3833> <t3834>I met Harry's sister, Lady Gwendolen.</t3834> <t3835>We were in her box.</t3835> <t3836>A lady as sweet as sugar.</t3836> <t3837>Patti sang wonderfully.</t3837> <t3838>My dear, don't talk about painful subjects.</t3838> <t3839>If you don't talk about an event, it means it didn't happen.</t3839> <t3840>As Harry says, what gives events and situations reality is their being spoken about, directly.</t3840> <t3841>Let me also point out that the girl was not that woman's only child.</t3841> <t3842>She also has a son, a very charming young man, from what I've heard.</t3842> <t3843>But he is not an actor.</t3843> <t3844>He's a sailor or something, something like that.</t3844> <t3845>Anyway, now tell me about yourself, what are you drawing?</t3845><t3846>"</t3846>
<t3847>“Did you go to the opera?” There was a tension in Basil Hallward's voice stemming from sadness.</t3847> <t3848>He asked, enunciating each word: “While Sibyl Vane lay dead in a filthy boarding house room, you went to the opera?</t3848> <t3849>While the girl you loved hasn't even found peace in her grave, you can talk to me about the sweetness of other women, about Patti’s magnificent voice?</t3849> <t3850>Man, don't you know what terrible things await that poor girl's tiny white body?</t3850><t3851>”</t3851>
<t3852>“Stop, Basil! I won't listen!” shouted Dorian as he jumped up.</t3852> <t3853>“You won't tell me such things.</t3853> <t3854>What's done is done.</t3854> <t3855>The past is the past.</t3855><t3856>”</t3856>
<t3857>“Are you saying that yesterday is in the past?</t3857><t3858>”</t3858>
<t3859>“What does it matter how much time has passed?</t3859> <t3860>Only shallow people wait for years to get over a feeling.</t3860> <t3861>A person who can control themselves can soothe their pain just as easily as they can invent a pleasure.</t3861> <t3862>I don't want to be a toy in the hands of my own emotions.</t3862> <t3863>I want to use my emotions, enjoy them, dominate them...</t3863><t3864>”</t3864>
<t3865>“Dorian, this is so terrible!</t3865> <t3866>Something has fundamentally changed you.</t3866> <t3867>In appearance, you are still that wonderful boy who comes to my studio every day to pose for his portrait.</t3867> <t3868>But back then, you were uncomplicated, natural, and full of love.</t3868> <t3869>You were the most unspoiled creature in the world.</t3869> <t3870>But now, I don't know what has happened to you.</t3870> <t3871>You speak as if you are heartless and cruel.</t3871> <t3872>It's all Harry's influence.</t3872> <t3873>That's all I can see.</t3873><t3874>”</t3874>
<t3875>The child turned bright red, walked to the glass door, and for a moment looked at the green garden outside, which was whipped by the sun's rays, burning and swirling.</t3875> <t3876>Finally, he said, "I owe Harry a lot, Basil."</t3876> <t3877>"More than I owe you.</t3877> <t3878>You only taught me to be arrogant.</t3878><t3879>"</t3879>
<t3880>“Yes, that's why I was punished, Dorian, or one day I will be punished.</t3880><t3881>”</t3881>
<t3882>Dorian turned hesitantly, "I don't understand, what do you mean, Basil?"</t3882> <t3883>"I don't know what you want either.</t3883> <t3884>What do you want?</t3884><t3885>"</t3885>
<t3886>The painter replied sorrowfully, "I want the Dorian Gray I painted in that picture."</t3886>
<t3887>The young man went and put his hand on his shoulder, saying, "Basil, you are very late," he said.</t3887> <t3888>"When I heard yesterday that Sibyl Vane had killed herself...</t3888><t3889>"</t3889>
<t3890>Basil Hallward, "Did he kill himself?</t3890> <t3891>Oh my God! Is it certain?" he exclaimed softly, looking at the young man with a face full of horror.</t3891>
<t3892>"My dear Basil! Surely you don't think this was just an ordinary accident, do you?</t3892> <t3893>Of course, he killed himself.</t3893><t3894>"</t3894>
<t3895>Burying his face in his hands, the painter muttered, "How terrible!"; a shiver ran through his entire body.</t3895>
<t3896>“No,” said Dorian Gray.</t3896><t3897>“There is nothing terrible in this.</t3897><t3898>It is one of the greatest romantic tragedies of the age.</t3898><t3899>Generally, theater actors lead extremely stereotypical lives.</t3899><t3900>They become good husbands, faithful wives, or something similarly tedious.</t3900><t3901>You understand what I mean, middle-class morality, and all that.</t3901><t3902>But how different Sibyl was!</t3902><t3903>She didn’t just act out her greatest tragedy, she lived it.</t3903><t3904>She was always a romantic hero.</t3904><t3905>On that last night she went on stage...</t3905><t3906>The night you saw her...</t3906><t3907>She acted poorly because she had learned the reality of love.</t3907><t3908>And when she learned that this reality wasn’t real, she died: Just as Juliet might have died.</t3908><t3909>She returned to the realm of art.</t3909><t3910>Sibyl has a saintly aspect too.</t3910><t3911>In her death, there is all the heartbreaking futility of saintly deaths, the wasted beauty.</t3911><t3912>But as I said, don’t think I didn’t suffer.</t3912><t3913>If you had come here an hour earlier yesterday...</t3913><t3914>Around half-past five, a quarter to six...</t3914><t3915>You would have found me drowned in tears.</t3915><t3916>Even Harry, who came here, or rather brought me the news, couldn’t perceive what I was feeling.</t3916><t3917>I suffered immensely.</t3917><t3918>Then it passed.</t3918><t3919>I can’t repeat an emotion.</t3919><t3920>Nobody can do that, except the sentimental.</t3920><t3921>And you are being very unfair to me, Basil.</t3921><t3922>You came here to console me.</t3922><t3923>You are very sweet.</t3923><t3924>But you see that I am already consoled.</t3924><t3925>You are furious.</t3925><t3926>Typical ‘understanding person’! You remind me of a story Harry told.</t3926><t3927>A man who dedicated himself to charity spent twenty years trying to right a wrong or correct an unjust law, I forget which.</t3927><t3928>Anyway, he finally succeeded but couldn’t have been more disappointed.</t3928><t3929>Because he had nothing left to do, he nearly died of boredom and became a sworn enemy of the people.</t3929><t3930>And besides, dear Basil, if you really want to console me, try to make me forget what happened or show the event to me from an artistic perspective!</t3930><t3931>Wasn’t it Gautier who wrote about the consolation of the arts?</t3931><t3932>I remember one day in your studio, a small parchment-covered book fell into my hands, and as I flipped through the pages, this exquisite sentence caught my eye.</t3932><t3933>Anyway, when we went to Marlow together, you told me about a young man: Yellow satin soothes all the sorrows of life, he said, but I am not like him.</t3933><t3934>I love tangible, touchable, beautiful things.</t3934><t3935>Antique brocades, green bronzes, lacquer works, ivory carvings, beautiful places, luxury, splendor...</t3935><t3936>These things have much to offer a person.</t3936><t3937>But the artistic spirit they create, or at least bring out, is the most important to me.</t3937><t3938>As Harry says, if we become spectators of our own lives, we will be freed from life’s troubles.</t3938><t3939>I know, my talking like this surprises you.</t3939><t3940>You weren’t aware of how much I had developed!</t3940><t3941>When you met me, I was a schoolboy.</t3941><t3942>Now I am a man.</t3942><t3943>I have new feelings, new thoughts, new perspectives.</t3943><t3944>I am different from before, but don’t love me any less.</t3944><t3945>I have changed, but you must always be my friend.</t3945><t3946>I love Harry very much, of course.</t3946><t3947>But I am not unaware that you are a better person than he is.</t3947><t3948>I can’t say you are stronger...</t3948><t3949>You are excessively afraid of life...</t3949><t3950>But you are still a better person.</t3950><t3951>We would have such happy days together!</t3951><t3952>Don’t leave me, Basil, but I don’t want you to judge me either.</t3952><t3953>I am what I am.</t3953><t3954>There is nothing more to say.</t3954><t3955>”</t3955>
<t3956>The painter's heart was strangely wrenched.</t3956> <t3957>He loved this child very, very much; his personality had been an important turning point in his own art.</t3957> <t3958>He could not bear the thought of scolding him any further.</t3958> <t3959>There were so many good, noble things in Dorian's being!</t3959>
<t3960>Finally, with a bitter smile, Hallward said, "Alright, Dorian."</t3960> <t3961>"After today, I will never speak to you about this painful matter again.</t3961> <t3962>I hope your name does not get involved in the incident.</t3962> <t3963>The inquiry will be held this afternoon.</t3963> <t3964>Have they summoned you?</t3964><t3965>"</t3965>
<t3966>Dorian nodded.</t3966> <t3967>When he heard the word "interrogation," a look of displeasure crossed his face.</t3967> <t3968>There was something so crude, so vulgar about such matters!</t3968>
<t3969>“They don't know my name.</t3969><t3970>”</t3970>
<t3971>“But Sibyl knew, didn't she?</t3971><t3972>”</t3972>
<t3973>“He only knew the first step, and I'm sure he didn't tell anyone about it.</t3973> <t3974>He mentioned once: Everyone was curious about who I was, and he always said my name was Sweet Prince.</t3974> <t3975>Isn't that sweet?</t3975> <t3976>Draw me a picture of Sibyl, Basil.</t3976> <t3977>I want to have something of her, more than just the memory of a few kisses and some broken words.</t3977><t3978>”</t3978>
<t3979>“I will try to do something, Dorian, if it will make you happy.</t3979> <t3980>But you must come and pose for me again.</t3980> <t3981>I can't work without you.</t3981><t3982>”</t3982>
<t3983>The young man shuddered and said, "I can never pose for you again, Basil!"</t3983>
<t3984>The painter stared at her.</t3984> <t3985>"My dear child, don't be ridiculous!" he said.</t3985> <t3986>"Are you saying that you don't like the portrait I made of you?</t3986> <t3987>Where is it?</t3987> <t3988>Why did you put a screen in front of it?</t3988> <t3989>Let me see it.</t3989> <t3990>This is my best work.</t3990> <t3991>My dear, move that screen, Dorian.</t3991> <t3992>It's a disgrace if the servant is hiding my work like this.</t3992> <t3993>No wonder the room looked different to me when I entered.</t3993><t3994>"</t3994>
<t3995>“My child has no connection with this, Basil.</t3995> <t3996>Do you think I allowed him to arrange my room!</t3996> <t3997>He just places the flowers occasionally, that's all.</t3997> <t3998>No, I did this.</t3998> <t3999>There was too much light falling on the portrait.</t3999><t4000>”</t4000>
<t4001>“Is it too much?</t4001> <t4002>You are mistaken, my friend.</t4002> <t4003>This is a suitable place for the portrait.</t4003> <t4004>Wait, let me see,” said Hallward as he moved towards the corner where the painting stood.</t4004>
<t4005>Dorian Gray, with an exclamation of horror escaping from his lips, rushed forward and stood between the painter and the portrait.</t4005> <t4006>He had turned deathly pale.</t4006> <t4007>“Basil, you must not look at it. I don't want you to,” he said.</t4007>
<t4008>Hallward laughed, "Am I not going to look at the painting I made myself?</t4008> <t4009>You can't be serious!" he said.</t4009> <t4010>"Why wouldn't I look at it?</t4010><t4011>"</t4011>
<t4012>"Basil, if you try to look, I swear on my honor that I will never speak to you again for the rest of my life.</t4012> <t4013>I am very serious.</t4013> <t4014>I am not giving any reason, and you will not ask.</t4014> <t4015>But remember, if you touch this screen, everything between us is over.</t4015><t4016>"</t4016>
<t4017>Hallward looked like he had been struck by lightning.</t4017> <t4018>He was staring at Dorian in astonishment.</t4018> <t4019>He had never seen him like this before.</t4019> <t4020>The boy had turned deathly pale with anger.</t4020> <t4021>His fists were clenched, and his pupils were like rings of blue fire.</t4021> <t4022>He was trembling from head to toe.</t4022>
<t4023>“Dorian!</t4023><t4024>”</t4024>
<t4025>“Don't speak!</t4025><t4026>”</t4026>
<t4027>“Well, but what's wrong with you?” The painter turned with a somewhat cold expression, saying, “If you don't want me to, of course, I won't look,” and walked towards the garden gate.</t4027> <t4028>“But it's truly ridiculous that I can't see my own work.</t4028> <t4029>Especially since I will exhibit it in Paris in the fall! Before that, I will probably need to apply a coat of varnish.</t4029> <t4030>So, given that I will inevitably have to see it someday, what difference does it make if I see it today?</t4030><t4031>”</t4031>
<t4032>Dorian, "Exhibit it? </t4032> <t4033>Do you want to put it in an exhibition?" he asked, shouting slightly.</t4033> <t4034>A strange chill enveloped him.</t4034> <t4035>So, would his secret be shown to the whole world?</t4035> <t4036>Would everyone gawk at the mystery of his life?</t4036> <t4037>This couldn't be.</t4037> <t4038>Something had to be done immediately...</t4038> <t4039>though he didn't know what it was...</t4039>
<t4040>“Yes.</t4040> <t4041>I don't think you'll object to this.</t4041> <t4042>George Petit4 will gather my best paintings and open a private exhibition on Sèze Street, in the first week of October.</t4042> <t4043>You will be away from the portrait for only a month.</t4043> <t4044>I think you can easily endure this.</t4044> <t4045>In fact, you might even be away from London at that time.</t4045> <t4046>If you always keep it behind a screen, it means you don't like it very much anyway.</t4046><t4047>”</t4047>
<t4048>Dorian passed his hand over his forehead.</t4048> <t4049>Sweat had beaded on his skin.</t4049> <t4050>He felt he was on the brink of a terrible danger.</t4050>
<t4051>“A month ago you were saying you would never exhibit the portrait,” he retorted.</t4051> <t4052>“Why did you change your mind?</t4052> <t4053>People like you, who pride themselves on consistency, are just as fickle as others, to be honest.</t4053> <t4054>The difference is that your changes seem quite meaningless.</t4054> <t4055>You can't have forgotten, you had solemnly promised me that you would never exhibit my painting for any reason.</t4055> <t4056>You had told Harry the same thing.”</t4056> <t4057>Dorian suddenly stopped, a sparkle lit up in his eyes.</t4057> <t4058>Something Lord Henry had once said half-jokingly, half-seriously came to his mind: “If you want to spend a baffling half hour, ask Basil to explain why he won't exhibit your portrait.</t4058> <t4059>He explained it to me, and my eyes were wide open.</t4059><t4060>”</t4060>
<t4061>Yes, maybe Basil had a secret too.</t4061> <t4062>He should ask and probe.</t4062> <t4063>Going right up to the painter and looking directly into his face, Dorian said, “Basil.”</t4063> <t4064>“We both have our own secrets.</t4064> <t4065>Tell me yours, and I’ll tell you mine.</t4065> <t4066>What was the reason you opposed exhibiting my portrait?</t4066><t4067>”</t4067>
<t4068>The painter couldn't help but shudder.</t4068> <t4069>“Dorian, if I explain, you might not love me as you used to; you will definitely mock me.</t4069> <t4070>I can't endure either of those.</t4070> <t4071>If you don't want me to look at your portrait again, that's enough for me.</t4071> <t4072>I'll look at you instead.</t4072> <t4073>If you want the best painting I've ever done in my life to be hidden from eyes, I have nothing to say.</t4073> <t4074>Your friendship is more valuable to me than fame or glory.</t4074><t4075>”</t4075>
<t4076>“No, Basil, tell me,” insisted Dorian.</t4076> <t4077>“I believe it is my right to know.”</t4077> <t4078>The earlier feeling of fear had vanished, replaced by curiosity.</t4078> <t4079>He was determined to uncover Basil Hallward’s secret.</t4079>
<t4080>The painter said with a nervous expression, "Dorian, let's sit down."</t4080> <t4081>"Let's sit down.</t4081> <t4082>Answer me one question.</t4082> <t4083>Did you notice anything strange in the painting?</t4083> <t4084>Perhaps something that didn't catch your eye at first but suddenly struck you later?</t4084><t4085>"</t4085>
<t4086>With trembling hands, Dorian clung to the edges of his chair and looked at the man in front of him with startled, wild eyes, speaking in a groan, "Basil!"</t4086>
<t4087>“I see that it has been so.</t4087><t4088>Do not say anything.</t4088><t4089>Wait and listen to what I have to say.</t4089><t4090>Dorian, from the moment I met you, your personality had an extraordinarily profound effect on me.</t4090><t4091>My soul, my mind, my artistic power came under your dominion.</t4091><t4092>There is an invisible ideal, the memory of which, like a unique dream, never leaves us artists.</t4092><t4093>And you became the visible, living symbol of this ideal for me.</t4093><t4094>I worshipped you.</t4094><t4095>I became jealous of everyone you spoke to. I wanted to keep you entirely to myself.</t4095><t4096>I was only happy when I was with you.</t4096><t4097>When you were away from me, I found your presence in my art...</t4097><t4098>Of course, I did not let you sense any of this.</t4098><t4099>It was impossible.</t4099><t4100>You could not have understood.</t4100><t4101>I myself could not fully understand.</t4101><t4102>I only knew that I had seen perfection face to face, and the world had taken on a marvelous appearance.</t4102><t4103>Perhaps it had become too marvelous, because such a mad worship is fraught with dangers: the danger of losing what is worshipped as much as the danger of being able to keep it...</t4103><t4104>Weeks added to weeks, and I gave myself more and more to you.</t4104><t4105>Then a new development occurred.</t4105><t4106>I had drawn you as Paris in elegant armor; as Adonis with a hunter's cloak and a shining spear in hand.</t4106><t4107>You had sat crowned with heavy water lilies at the bow of Hadrian's boat, watching the murky green waters of the Nile.</t4107><t4108>You had bent over a still pool in a Greek grove and seen your face in the silent silver of the water.</t4108><t4109>All of this happened in a manner entirely suitable to art: ideal, distant, unconscious...</t4109><t4110>Then one day, on what I might call an ominous day, I decided to draw your portrait as you truly are.</t4110><t4111>I would draw you not in the costumes of past ages but in your own time, in your own clothes.</t4111><t4112>I do not know if it was the realism in the method that pushed me to take you directly, away from veils and mists.</t4112><t4113>What I do know is that every speck of paint, every shade of color that appeared while working on this portrait seemed to reveal my secret.</t4113><t4114>I began to fear that others would understand this idolatrous side of me.</t4114><t4115>Dorian, I sensed that I had said too much with this portrait, that I had put too much of myself into it.</t4115><t4116>That is when I decided never to allow the painting to be exhibited.</t4116><t4117>You were a bit upset by this; you could not know what the painting meant to me.</t4117><t4118>I talked about it with Harry, he laughed at me, but I did not care.</t4118><t4119>As I sat in front of the painting after finishing it, I felt that my decision was right...</t4119><t4120>Anyway, a few days later, the portrait left my studio.</t4120><t4121>When the unbearable enchantment of your presence lifted from me, I began to think that it was madness to believe I saw something special in this painting.</t4121><t4122>All it was, was that you were extraordinarily handsome, and I was a good painter, that's all.</t4122><t4123>It is wrong to think that the passion one feels while creating always reflects in the created work as it is.</t4123><t4124>I still hold this view.</t4124><t4125>Art is always more abstract than we think.</t4125><t4126>Form and color tell us about form and color, that's all.</t4126><t4127>Often it seems to me that instead of revealing the artist, art completely hides him from view.</t4127><t4128>That's how it is.</t4128><t4129>When I received this proposal from Paris, I decided to make your portrait the masterpiece of my exhibition.</t4129><t4130>It never occurred to me that you would oppose it.</t4130><t4131>But now I see that you are right.</t4131><t4132>This painting cannot be exhibited.</t4132><t4133>Dorian, do not be angry with me for what I have told you.</t4133><t4134>As I once told Harry, you were created to be worshipped.</t4134><t4135>”</t4135>
<t4136>Dorian Gray took a deep breath.</t4136> <t4137>The color returned to his face, a smile flickered on his lips.</t4137> <t4138>The danger had passed.</t4138> <t4139>For now, he was safe.</t4139> <t4140>Nevertheless, he couldn't help but feel an infinite pity for the painter who made this strange confession to him, and he wondered, "Will I ever fall under the dominance of a friend's personality like this?"</t4140> <t4141>Lord Henry had the allure of being very dangerous.</t4141> <t4142>But that was all.</t4142> <t4143>He was so excessively intelligent, so excessively cynical that one couldn't truly love him.</t4143> <t4144>Would anyone ever come into his life who could evoke such an idolatrously strange attachment within him?</t4144> <t4145>Was this one of the things life had prepared for him?</t4145>
<t4146>Hallward added, "I think it's surprising that you saw these things in the portrait."</t4146> <t4147>"Did you really see them?</t4147><t4148>"</t4148>
<t4149>Dorian replied, "I saw something."</t4149> <t4150>"I saw something that struck me as very strange.</t4150><t4151>"</t4151>
<t4152>“Do you think there's any harm in me looking now?</t4152><t4153>”</t4153>
<t4154>Dorian shook his head.</t4154> <t4155>"Don't ask this of me, Basil.</t4155> <t4156>I can't let you stand in front of that picture, not in this world.</t4156><t4157>"</t4157>
<t4158>“But one day you'll allow it, right?</t4158><t4159>”</t4159>
<t4160>“Never.</t4160><t4161>”</t4161>
<t4162>“I don't know, maybe you're right.</t4162> <t4163>Now, goodbye, Dorian.</t4163> <t4164>You are the only person who has truly influenced my art in my life.</t4164> <t4165>Whatever good work I have produced, I owe it to you.</t4165> <t4166>Ah, Dorian, you can't imagine what it cost me to say all these things to you.</t4166><t4167>”</t4167>
<t4168>Dorian said, "Dear Basil, what did you tell me?"</t4168> <t4169>"You only said that you admired me excessively.</t4169> <t4170>That's not even a compliment.</t4170><t4171>"</t4171>
<t4172>“It wasn't said as a compliment anyway.</t4172> <t4173>It was a confession.</t4173> <t4174>Now that I've made this confession, it feels like something inside me has extinguished.</t4174> <t4175>Maybe one should never put the feeling of reverence into words.</t4175><t4176>”</t4176>
<t4177>“It was a disappointing confession for me.</t4177><t4178>”</t4178>
<t4179>"How?</t4179> <t4180>What were you expecting, Dorian?</t4180> <t4181>Did you see something else in the portrait?</t4181> <t4182>But there was nothing else to see.</t4182> <t4183>Isn't that right?</t4183><t4184>"</t4184>
<t4185>“No, there was nothing else.</t4185> <t4186>Why did you ask?</t4186> <t4187>And don't talk so much about worshipping, Basil.</t4187> <t4188>These are foolish words.</t4188> <t4189>You and I are friends, and we should always remain friends.</t4189><t4190>”</t4190>
<t4191>The painter said in a sad voice, "Harry is your friend."</t4191>
<t4192>The young man chuckled to himself, "Ah, Harry!"</t4192> <t4193>"Harry spends his days saying unbelievable things, and his nights doing unimaginable things.</t4193> <t4194>Exactly the kind of life I want to lead.</t4194> <t4195>Still, I don't think I would go to Harry if I had a problem.</t4195> <t4196>I would prefer to come to you, Basil.</t4196><t4197>"</t4197>
<t4198>“Will you give me a gene?</t4198><t4199>”</t4199>
<t4200>“It's impossible.</t4200><t4201>”</t4201>
<t4202>"By rejecting this, you are sabotaging my artistic life, Dorian.</t4202> <t4203>No one is ever faced with two ideal things.</t4203> <t4204>It is rare enough for even one to appear.</t4204><t4205>"</t4205>
<t4206>“I can't explain, Basil, but I must never pose for you again.</t4206> <t4207>Is there some kind of curse in portraits or what!</t4207> <t4208>It's as if the portrait has a life of its own.</t4208> <t4209>I'll come and have tea with you.</t4209> <t4210>That would be just as enjoyable.</t4210><t4211>”</t4211>
<t4212>Hallward said sadly, "I'm afraid it would only be that way for you," he murmured.</t4212> <t4213>"Now, goodbye.</t4213> <t4214>I'm sorry you didn't let me look at the painting one more time, but what can be done?</t4214> <t4215>I understand your feelings on this matter very well.</t4215><t4216>"</t4216>
<t4217>As he went outside, Dorian smiled to himself.</t4217> <t4218>Poor Basil! He never knew the real reason!</t4218> <t4219>Then, how strange it was that, almost by chance, he managed to extract the secret from his friend's mouth, where Dorian would have had to reveal his own secret!</t4219> <t4220>That strange confession explained so much to Dorian!</t4220> <t4221>The painter's ridiculous fits of jealousy, his mad devotion, his excessive praises, his inexplicable shyness...</t4221> <t4222>Dorian now understood all of this, and a feeling of pity enveloped him.</t4222> <t4223>Wasn't there a tragic aspect to a friendship in which such a color of love was mixed?</t4223>
<t4224>The young man sighed deeply and rang the bell.</t4224> <t4225>The portrait had to be hidden at all costs.</t4225> <t4226>He could not risk such danger again as he did today.</t4226> <t4227>It had been madness to keep the painting in a room where his friends came and went, even for an hour.</t4227>
<t4228>4.</t4228> <t4229>At the end of the 19th century, the most popular art gallery was George Petit's.</t4229> <t4230>It was founded in 1882.</t4230> <t4231>It opened its doors to many different movements and exhibited the Impressionists during their initial successful period.</t4231> <t4232>(Ç.</t4232> <t4233>N.</t4233><t4234>)</t4234>
<t4235>Tenth chapter</t4235>
<t4236>When the servant entered, Dorian looked at him carefully.</t4236> <t4237>He wondered if the man had thought about looking behind the screen.</t4237> <t4238>The man stood calmly, waiting for his master's command.</t4238> <t4239>Dorian lit a cigarette, walked over, and glanced at the mirror.</t4239> <t4240>He could clearly see Victor's face reflected in the mirror.</t4240> <t4241>This face was like the mask of a "submissive servant."</t4241> <t4242>There was nothing to fear from this angle.</t4242> <t4243>Still, Dorian thought it best to remain vigilant.</t4243>
<t4244>Speaking slowly, he told the man to summon the housekeeper to the room and then to go to the framer and send two men to the house.</t4244> <t4245>As the man was leaving the room, it seemed his eyes had glanced towards the screen.</t4245> <t4246>Or was Dorian becoming paranoid?</t4246>
<t4247>A few minutes later, Ms. Leaf entered, wearing a black silk dress on her back, and with old-fashioned, fingerless silk gloves on her wrinkled hands.</t4247> <t4248>Dorian asked her for the key to the schoolroom.</t4248>
<t4249>The woman shouted, "The old school room, Mr. Dorian?"</t4249> <t4250>"But it's covered in dust.</t4250> <t4251>I need to tidy it up a bit and put it in order before you can enter.</t4251> <t4252>It's not in a state to be seen, really, believe me, it's not in a state to be seen.</t4252><t4253>"</t4253>
<t4254>“I don't want it fixed, Ms. Leaf.</t4254> <t4255>I just want its key.</t4255><t4256>”</t4256>
<t4257>“But sir, if you go in there, you'll get covered in cobwebs.</t4257> <t4258>That room hasn't been opened in almost five years; it hasn't been opened since the Lord's death.</t4258><t4259>”</t4259>
<t4260>Dorian flinched when his grandfather was mentioned.</t4260> <t4261>He had very bad memories related to his grandfather.</t4261>
<t4262>“No harm,” he said.</t4262> <t4263>“I just want to take a look there, nothing else.</t4263> <t4264>Give me the key.</t4264><t4265>”</t4265>
<t4266>The old woman, fumbling with the bunch of keys with her trembling hands, said, "Here you go, sir, here is the key."</t4266> <t4267>"I will take it out now.</t4267> <t4268>You don't want to move your room there or anything, do you, sir?</t4268> <t4269>You are so comfortable here."</t4269><t4270>"</t4270>
<t4271>Dorian grumbled, "No way, no."</t4271> <t4272>"Thank you, Leaf.</t4272> <t4273>That's all for now.</t4273><t4274>"</t4274>
<t4275>The housekeeper woman lingered for a few more minutes, chatting about a detail of the housework.</t4275> <t4276>The young man sighed and told her to manage things as she knew best.</t4276> <t4277>Ms. Leaf went outside with smiles.</t4277>
<t4278>When the door closed, Dorian put the key in his pocket and looked around.</t4278> <t4279>A heavy, gold-embroidered, wide, purple satin cover caught his eye.</t4279> <t4280>This cover, a magnificent Venetian embroidery from the late seventeenth century, had been found by his grandfather in a monastery near Bologna.</t4280> <t4281>Yes, it was suitable to cover that dreadful thing.</t4281> <t4282>Perhaps it had generally been used to cover a corpse.</t4282> <t4283>Now it would serve to hide something that carried its own kind of decay; something that carried a decay worse than death's decay, something that continually spawned horrors yet never died.</t4283> <t4284>What worms and maggots are to a corpse in the ground, Dorian's sins would be to the painted image on the canvas.</t4284> <t4285>Sins would mar this image's beauty, gnaw at its delicacy.</t4285> <t4286>They would defile this image, turn it into something obscene.</t4286> <t4287>But the portrait would still continue to live.</t4287> <t4288>It would always remain alive.</t4288>
<t4289>The young man shivered from head to toe, regretting for a moment that he hadn't told Basil the real reason for wanting to keep the portrait a secret.</t4289><t4290>Basil would have helped him resist falling under Lord Henry's influence or becoming a prisoner of his own hedonism.</t4290><t4291>In Basil's love for him – for it truly was love – there was nothing base or unspiritual.</t4291><t4292>It was not a mere physical admiration for beauty.</t4292><t4293>Such admiration is born of the senses and dies when the senses grow weary.</t4293><t4294>No, this was the kind of love that Michelangelo had experienced, the kind that Montaigne, Winckelmann, and even Shakespeare had known.</t4294><t4295>Yes, yes, if he had told him, Basil could have saved him.</t4295><t4296>But now it was too late.</t4296><t4297>The past could always be erased.</t4297><t4298>This could be achieved through remorse, forgetfulness, and denial.</t4298><t4299>But the future was inevitable.</t4299><t4300>Within Dorian lay passions that would eventually find their dreadful outlets, dreams that would turn the shadows of his vices into reality.</t4300>
<t4301>He took the large, embroidered, purple cover from the divan; with the cover in his hand, he went behind the screen.</t4301> <t4302>Did the face on the canvas bear a lower expression than before?</t4302> <t4303>The painting seemed unchanged to his eye, yet his disgust towards this object had intensified.</t4303> <t4304>Golden hair, blue eyes, rose-red lips...</t4304> <t4305>Everything was in its place.</t4305> <t4306>The only thing that had changed was the expression.</t4306> <t4307>This expression was now so cruel that it sent shivers down his spine.</t4307> <t4308>Compared to the criticism and condemnation he found in this expression, Basil's reproaches about Sibyl Vane seemed so weak, so feeble and insignificant!</t4308> <t4309>It was his own soul looking at him, judging him from the canvas.</t4309> <t4310>Dorian, grimacing in pain, hung the magnificent cover over the painting.</t4310> <t4311>Just then, there was a knock at the door.</t4311> <t4312>As the servant entered, Dorian emerged from behind the screen.</t4312>
<t4313>"The men have arrived, monsieur."</t4313><t4314></t4314>
<t4315>Dorian thought that he should get rid of this man immediately.</t4315> <t4316>There was a slyness in the man; his eyes looked deceitful and cunning.</t4316> <t4317>Dorian sat at his writing desk and scribbled a note to Lord Henry, asking him to send something to read, then reminded him that they would meet at a quarter past eight that evening.</t4317> <t4318>Handing the note to his servant, he said, "Wait for the reply."</t4318> <t4319>"Also, bring the men here.</t4319><t4320>"</t4320>
<t4321>A few minutes later, the door knocked again and Mr. Hubbard, the famous framer from South Audley Street, entered.</t4321> <t4322>He was accompanied by a rough-looking young assistant.</t4322> <t4323>Mr. Hubbard was a man with a red face and red beard.</t4323> <t4324>The unchanging poverty of the artists who were his clients served to temper his admiration for art.</t4324> <t4325>He generally never left his shop, waiting for others to come to him.</t4325> <t4326>But he always made an exception for Dorian Gray.</t4326> <t4327>Dorian had a charm that captivated everyone.</t4327> <t4328>Just seeing him was a pleasure in itself.</t4328>
<t4329>Mr. Hubbard, rubbing his plump, freckled hands together, asked, "What can I do for you, Mr. Gray?"</t4329> <t4330>"I did not want to miss the honor of coming to you personally.</t4330> <t4331>I have a frame as delicate as a girl, sir.</t4331> <t4332>I acquired it at an auction.</t4332> <t4333>Old Florentine work.</t4333> <t4334>If I am not mistaken, it came from Fronthill.</t4334> <t4335>Perfect for a religious painting, Mr. Gray.</t4335><t4336>"</t4336>
<t4337>“I am sorry for putting you through the trouble of coming here, Mr. Hubbard.</t4337> <t4338>Although I am not very interested in religious paintings, I will definitely come and look at your frame.</t4338> <t4339>What I want today is simply to have a painting carried to the upper floor of the house.</t4339> <t4340>It is quite a heavy thing; that's why I thought of asking you for two helpers.</t4340><t4341>”</t4341>
<t4342>“It's no trouble at all, Mr. Gray.</t4342> <t4343>It is a pleasure to serve you.</t4343> <t4344>Where is the painting in question, sir?</t4344><t4345>”</t4345>
<t4346>Dorian said, "Here," and pulled the screen.</t4346> <t4347>"Will you be able to carry this with its cover and all?</t4347> <t4348>I don't want it to get scratched while going upstairs.</t4348><t4349>"</t4349>
<t4350>The cheerful framer said, "Easy, sir," and began to remove the hooks of the long brass chains holding the portrait with his assistant.</t4350> <t4351>"Now...</t4351> <t4352>Where shall we take it, Mr. Gray?</t4352><t4353>"</t4353>
<t4354>“Let me lead the way, Mr. Hubbard; please follow me.</t4354> <t4355>Or you go ahead, that's better.</t4355> <t4356>I'm afraid we will have to climb to the top floor.</t4356> <t4357>Let's take the front stairs, they are wider.</t4357><t4358>”</t4358>
<t4359>Dorian held the door for them, the men passed into the hall and began to climb the stairs.</t4359> <t4360>Due to the ornate frame, the painting was extremely bulky.</t4360> <t4361>Like all true craftsmen, Mr. Hubbard, who did not enjoy seeing polite gentlemen doing useful work in the slightest, had to extend his hand occasionally to help them despite his overly respectful objections.</t4361>
<t4362>When they reached the top landing, Mr. Hubbard, out of breath, muttered, "It was quite heavy, huh!"</t4362> <t4363>Then he wiped his sweat-shining forehead.</t4363>
<t4364>Dorian, "Yes, I'm sorry, it is really quite heavy," he murmured as he opened the door to the room that would henceforth harbor the strange secret of his life, shielding his soul from foreign eyes.</t4364>
<t4365>He had not set foot in this room, which he used as a playroom when he was a child and later as a study room when he grew older, for over four years.</t4365> <t4366>This spacious, airy room was specially made by the late Lord Kelso for his young grandson.</t4366> <t4367>Due to his astonishing resemblance to his daughter and other reasons, Lord Kelso had always hated this child and wanted to keep him away from himself.</t4367>
<t4368>Dorian found the room almost unchanged.</t4368> <t4369>There was the Italian cassone with its wings adorned with fanciful pictures and its gilded reliefs tarnished, where he had hidden so many times as a child.</t4369> <t4370>There was the yellow Indian wood bookcase, holding his school books with their dog-eared pages.</t4370> <t4371>On the wall behind it still hung that old, shabby Flemish tapestry: In the garden depicted on it, a faded king and queen played chess, while a little further away, a hunting party with falcons on their armored wrists passed by.</t4371> <t4372>Dorian remembered all of these so well!</t4372> <t4373>As he looked around, it was as if he was reliving every moment of his lonely childhood.</t4373> <t4374>The thought of hiding that cursed portrait in this room made his skin crawl, as he recalled the unblemished purity of his childhood experiences.</t4374> <t4375>In those bygone days, he had never even imagined what life had in store for him!</t4375>
<t4376>However, there was no other corner in the house so far from curious eyes.</t4376> <t4377>The key was in his hand; no one else could enter here.</t4377> <t4378>If it wanted, the painted face under that purple funeral cloth could become animalistic, sluggish, and filthy.</t4378> <t4379>Who cares? No one would see it anyway!</t4379> <t4380>Dorian himself wouldn't see it either.</t4380> <t4381>Why should he watch the disgusting decay of his soul?</t4381> <t4382>He would preserve his youth, and that would be enough for him.</t4382> <t4383>Besides, why shouldn't his soul elevate and ennoble over time?</t4383> <t4384>There was no reason for his future to be so disgraceful.</t4384> <t4385>Perhaps one day, a love that entered his life would purify him and protect him from sins, why not?</t4385> <t4386>(Ah, those sins that derive their allure and charm from their very mystery, already stirring in his soul and body!) Perhaps one day the cruel expression of that red, delicate mouth would fade away, and Dorian could show Basil Hallward's masterpiece to the whole world.</t4386>
<t4387>No way, this was impossible.</t4387> <t4388>That thing on the canvas was aging hour by hour, week by week.</t4388> <t4389>Even if he could escape the ugliness of sin, the ugliness of old age was waiting for him.</t4389> <t4390>His cheeks would sink and sag.</t4390> <t4391>His eyes would dull and become ugly with lines surrounding their edges.</t4391> <t4392>His hair would lose its shine, his mouth would droop or collapse, and like the mouths of all old people, it would have a foolish or disgusting appearance.</t4392> <t4393>That wrinkled neck, crooked body, those blue-veined, ice-cold hands he remembered from his grandfather who had treated him so harshly in his childhood...</t4393> <t4394>The painting had to be kept secret.</t4394> <t4395>There was no other way.</t4395>
<t4396>The young man turned around and said in a tired voice, "Bring it inside, please, Mr. Hubbard."</t4396> <t4397>"Sorry for keeping you waiting.</t4397> <t4398>My mind wandered to something else.</t4398><t4399>"</t4399>
<t4400>Still out of breath, Mr. Hubbard said, "I like to rest whenever I get the chance, Mr. Gray."</t4400> <t4401>"Where should we put it, sir?"</t4401><t4402>"</t4402>
<t4403>"Anywhere will do.</t4403> <t4404>Just over there.</t4404> <t4405>I don't want it hung up.</t4405> <t4406>Just lean it against the wall.</t4406> <t4407>Thank you very much.</t4407><t4408>"</t4408>
<t4409>“Can we look at this artwork, sir?</t4409><t4410>”</t4410>
<t4411>Dorian shuddered.</t4411> <t4412>Without taking his eyes off the man, he said, "It wouldn't interest you, Mr. Hubbard."</t4412> <t4413>If the man dared to lift that magnificent silk that covered the secret of his life, Dorian was ready to pounce on him and knock him to the ground.</t4413> <t4414>"I won't keep you any longer," he added.</t4414> <t4415>"Thank you very much for your courtesy in coming.</t4415><t4416>"</t4416>
<t4417>"It's nothing, Mr. Gray, nothing at all.</t4417> <t4418>We are always at your service, sir.</t4418><t4419>"</t4419>
<t4420>Then Mr. Hubbard began to descend the stairs with noisy steps, his assistant following behind.</t4420> <t4421>This young man turned his head for a moment and looked at Dorian with disbelief on his coarse-featured, unremarkable face.</t4421> <t4422>He had never seen anyone so extraordinary in his life.</t4422>
<t4423>When the men's footsteps could no longer be heard, Dorian locked the door and put the key in his pocket.</t4423> <t4424>He was safe now.</t4424> <t4425>No one would ever look at that horrible thing again.</t4425> <t4426>No eyes other than his own would ever see Dorian's shame.</t4426>
<t4427>When Dorian reached the library, he saw that it was past five o'clock and the tea tray had been brought in.</t4427> <t4428>On a small table made of fragrant, dark wood with heavy mother-of-pearl inlay, a gift from his guardian's wife Lady Radley (a sweet lady who had made a profession of her illness and had spent the last winter in Cairo), there was a note from Lord Henry.</t4428> <t4429>Next to it was a book with a yellow paper cover, slightly torn at the edges, and somewhat dirty page edges.</t4429> <t4430>St.</t4430> <t4431>A copy of the third edition of the James Gazette had been placed on the edge of the tea tray.</t4431> <t4432>It was apparent that Victor had returned.</t4432> <t4433>Dorian wondered if he had run into him in the hall and managed to find out what the framers were doing.</t4433> <t4434>Victor would certainly notice the absence of the portrait, perhaps he had already noticed it while arranging the tea tray.</t4434> <t4435>Since the screen had not been moved back to its original place, the empty spot on the wall was visible.</t4435> <t4436>Perhaps one night, Dorian would catch Victor sneaking upstairs and tampering with the door of the room above.</t4436> <t4437>It was a terrible thing to have a spy in one's own house.</t4437> <t4438>Dorian had heard of wealthy people who had been blackmailed for life because a servant read a letter, overheard a conversation, found a card with an address on it, or discovered a faded flower or a crumpled piece of lace under a pillow.</t4438>
<t4439>Sighing, he poured tea into his cup, then opened Lord Henry's letter.</t4439> <t4440>Lord Henry informed him that he had sent him the evening newspaper along with a book that might interest him, and that he would be at his club at eight fifteen.</t4440> <t4441>Dorian lazily opened the newspaper and skimmed through it.</t4441> <t4442>The red mark on the fifth page caught his attention.</t4442> <t4443>The marked headline was:</t4443>
<t4444>INVESTIGATION ABOUT A THEATER ACTRESS.</t4444> <t4445>This morning, at the address Bell Tavern, Hoxton Road, a district inquiry was held by Mr. Danby regarding the investigation into the death of Sibyl Vane, one of the young actresses of the Royal Theatre in Holborn.</t4445> <t4446>The death was ruled as accidental.</t4446> <t4447>The grief of the deceased girl's mother brought tears to the eyes of those present.</t4447> <t4448>Ms. Vane frequently fainted both while giving her own testimony and during the testimony of Dr. Birrell, who conducted the autopsy of Sibyl Vane.</t4448>
<t4449>Dorian frowned and tore the newspaper in half, throwing it into the garden.</t4449> <t4450>How ugly this incident was!</t4450> <t4451>Real ugliness spoiled everything so much!</t4451> <t4452>Dorian was a bit annoyed with Lord Henry for bringing the news to him.</t4452> <t4453>Especially marking it with a red pencil was truly foolish.</t4453> <t4454>Victor could read it.</t4454> <t4455>The fellow's English was more than sufficient for that.</t4455>
<t4456>Maybe he had read it and had already started to suspect something.</t4456> <t4457>On the other hand, what would come of it?</t4457> <t4458>What did Dorian Gray have to do with Sibyl Vane's death?</t4458> <t4459>There was nothing to be afraid of.</t4459> <t4460>He hadn't killed Sibyl!</t4460>
<t4461>His eyes caught on the yellow book that Lord Henry had sent.</t4461> <t4462>What could this be?</t4462> <t4463>Dorian walked over to the small, mother-of-pearl colored, eight-sided table –this table always seemed to him like the product of mysterious Egyptian bees working in silver– and, taking the book in his hand, sank into a chair and began to flip through the pages.</t4463> <t4464>Within a few minutes, he was engrossed.</t4464> <t4465>This was the strangest book he had ever read.</t4465> <t4466>It was as if all the sins of the world, dressed in exquisite garments, were parading silently before his eyes in time with the sweet melody of flutes.</t4466> <t4467>The things he had vaguely imagined were suddenly becoming real.</t4467> <t4468>Things he had never even seen in his dreams were unfolding before his eyes step by step.</t4468>
<t4469>This was a novel without a plot, with only one main character.</t4469> <t4470>More precisely, it was merely a psychological study of a young Parisian.</t4470> <t4471>This young man, in the nineteenth century, had devoted his life to reviving the passions and lifestyles of all centuries other than his own.</t4471> <t4472>He had decided to encompass within himself all the phases the world-spirit had undergone; he loved the renunciations that people, in their lack of wisdom, called "virtue" just as much as he loved the natural rebellions that sages still called sin, solely because of their artificiality.</t4472> <t4473>The style of the book was both vivid and dark; it was filled with slang words and archaic expressions, technical explanations, and detailed commentaries: a style that defined the finest pens of the Symbolist movement in France.</t4473> <t4474>The writing contained metaphors as strangely shaped as orchid flowers, with colors just as delicate.</t4474> <t4475>Emotional experiences were described in the terms of mystical philosophy.</t4475> <t4476>At times, the reader could not distinguish whether they were reading the spiritual ecstasies of a medieval mystic or the morbid confessions of a contemporary sinner.</t4476> <t4477>It was a poisonous book.</t4477> <t4478>It seemed as if a heavy incense scent had permeated its pages, clouding one's mind.</t4478> <t4479>Even the tempo of the flow of sentences...</t4479> <t4480>Even the mysterious monotony of this music, composed of words filled with complex refrains and meticulous, delicate repetitions, seemed to cast a trance over Dorian's mind: a dreamlike stupor, resembling an illness, that grew as he moved from chapter to chapter, making him oblivious to the day's end and the shadows creeping in.</t4480>
<t4481>The coppery green sky, adorned with a single star, and the shimmer of the cloudless sky shone through the window.</t4481> <t4482>Dorian continued to read in this pale light until his eyes could no longer see.</t4482> <t4483>Victor warned his master about the time on numerous occasions.</t4483> <t4484>Finally, Dorian stood up, went to the next room, placed the book on the small Florentine table beside his bed, and began to change his clothes to go out for dinner.</t4484>
<t4485>It was almost nine o'clock when he reached the lodge.</t4485> <t4486>He found Lord Henry alone in the morning room.</t4486> <t4487>It was clear that he was very bored.</t4487>
<t4488>Dorian said, "Forgive me, Harry."</t4488> <t4489>"But it's all your fault, actually.</t4489> <t4490>The book you sent me engrossed me so much that I lost track of time.</t4490><t4491>"</t4491>
<t4492>Lord Henry, "Yes, I knew you would like it," he said, getting up from his seat.</t4492>
<t4493>“I didn't say I loved, Harry.</t4493> <t4494>I said it enveloped me.</t4494> <t4495>There's a big difference between the two.</t4495><t4496>”</t4496>
<t4497>Lord Henry murmured, "So, you have learned this?"</t4497>
<t4498>They moved to the dining room.</t4498>
<t4499>Chapter Eleven</t4499>
<t4500>Dorian Gray could not free himself from the influence of this book for years.</t4500> <t4501>Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that he never even thought of freeing himself from this influence.</t4501> <t4502>He bought exactly nine large copies of the book from Paris.</t4502> <t4503>He had them bound in different colors to match the changes in his mood and the whims of his often erratic nature.</t4503> <t4504>The hero of the novel, this extraordinary young Parisian man who combined emotional and scientific tendencies within himself, had become a symbol for Dorian, as if he had been designed before Dorian was born.</t4504> <t4505>In any case, the entire book seemed like a story of his life, written before it was lived.</t4505>
<t4506>At one point, he was luckier than the incredible hero of the novel himself.</t4506> <t4507>Upon the sudden ruin of her beauty, which was evidently very striking at first, the Parisian had developed a rather ridiculous fear of mirrors, polished metals, and still waters at a very young age.</t4507> <t4508>However, Dorian had never known this fear, and there was no reason for him to know it.</t4508> <t4509>He was reading the final chapters, which told the somewhat exaggerated but truly heartbreaking story of a man who had lost what he valued most in the world and in people, with an almost cruel delight.</t4509> <t4510>Perhaps in every delight, just as in every pleasure, there is a share of cruelty.</t4510>
<t4511>Dorian Gray's extraordinary beauty, which fascinated Basil Hallward and many others like him, seemed never to diminish.</t4511> <t4512>Even those who had heard the ugliest things about him – for from time to time, incredible rumors about his lifestyle would circulate around London and become the talk of the clubs – did not believe he could be capable of baseness when they saw him.</t4512> <t4513>Dorian always had an appearance as if he had kept himself clean and untouched by the world's filth.</t4513> <t4514>Those who spoke with foul mouths would fall silent when he entered.</t4514> <t4515>There was something in the pure serenity of Dorian Gray's face that seemed to reproach them.</t4515> <t4516>His mere presence was enough to evoke in such people the memory of their own tarnished innocence.</t4516> <t4517>They wondered how someone so charming, beautiful, and refined could remain untouched by the grime of this age, which was both opportunistic and lustful.</t4517>
<t4518>After his long, mysterious absences that led to strange rumors among his friends—or those who thought they were his friends—Dorian Gray would quietly go up to the room upstairs when he returned home, unlock the door with the key he now always kept with him, take a mirror in hand, and stand before the portrait painted by Basil Hallward.</t4518> <t4519>He would look at the aged, evil-filled face on the canvas, and then at his own beautiful, fresh face smiling back at him from the mirrored glass.</t4519> <t4520>The sharp contrast between the two would stir a thrill of pleasure within him.</t4520> <t4521>He was falling more and more in love with his own beauty, and becoming more and more interested in the decay of his soul.</t4521> <t4522>He would examine with infinite attention and a dreadful, inhuman delight the lines that played around the corners of that full, sensual mouth and the furrows that marred the wrinkled forehead.</t4522> <t4523>Often, he did not know which was more terrifying: the marks of sin or the marks of aging?</t4523> <t4524>He would smile as he held his own white hand next to the portrait's wrinkled, swollen hands, mocking that misshapen body and those emaciated legs.</t4524>
<t4525>On some nights, lying sleepless in his own fragrant room or in the small, filthy room of the notorious inn at the dock where he came and went under an assumed name, he would think with a pity –sharpened even more because it was entirely selfish– about how he was deliberately driving his soul to ruin.</t4525> <t4526>However, such moments were very rare.</t4526> <t4527>The curiosity about life that Lord Henry had first awakened while they were sitting in Basil’s garden seemed to flare up as it was satisfied.</t4527> <t4528>The more Dorian knew, the more he wanted to learn.</t4528> <t4529>He had a ravenous appetite that grew more voracious as it was sated.</t4529>
<t4530>However, it could not be said that he behaved excessively recklessly, at least in his relations with society.</t4530> <t4531>In winter, once or twice a month, and every Wednesday evening during the social season, he would open his beautiful house to those around him and invite the most famous musicians of the day to enchant his guests with their artistic wonders.</t4531> <t4532>Those small dinner parties, in the organization of which Lord Henry always helped him, were famous not only for the meticulousness shown in the selection and placement of the guests but also for the refined taste displayed in the decoration of the table.</t4532> <t4533>The decoration of these tables with antique gold and silver sets, embroidered cloths, and flowers from distant climates resembled a symphony.</t4533> <t4534>Among the guests, especially those who were still in their youth, many saw or imagined Dorian Gray as the ideal type they had dreamed of during their school days at Eton and Oxford: a type that combined the true culture of a book-loving scholar with all the agility, elegance, and impeccable manners of a "man of life."</t4534> <t4535>To such people, Dorian appeared as one of those whom Dante described as "those who seek perfection by worshipping beauty."</t4535> <t4536>Like Gautier, he was also one of those who believed in the existence of the visible world.</t4536>
<t4537>Indeed, for him, the foremost and most sublime of all arts was Life itself; all other arts were nothing but a preparation for Life.</t4537> <t4538>In fashion, which for a moment made the unreal universal, and in dandyism, which was his own emphasis on the absolute contemporaneity of beauty, Dorian did not fail to find something appealing.</t4538> <t4539>His style of dress and the fashions he occasionally adopted left a noticeable impact on the young men at the Mayfair balls and the Pall Mall Club.</t4539> <t4540>These young men imitated his every move, trying to capture the charm and attractiveness that were the by-products of his elegant affectations, which he did not actually take very seriously.</t4540>
<t4541>Although Dorian eagerly settled into the position that opened up before him as soon as he reached adolescence.</t4541> <t4542>In fact, he did not lack a secret pleasure at the thought that he could play the role in London that the author of “Satyricon” once played in Nero's Rome.</t4542> <t4543>Yet, deep in his heart, there was a desire to be something more than just an arbiter elegantiarum – an arbiter of elegance to be consulted on matters such as wearing jewelry, tying a cravat, or holding a cane.</t4543> <t4544>He was trying to develop a brand-new life scheme that found the highest realization of oneself in the spiritualization of the senses, with a rational philosophy and regular principles.</t4544>
<t4545>The sanctification of the senses has often, and very rightly, been condemned and criticized.</t4545> <t4546>Mankind has always harbored a natural dread of passions and senses that appear stronger than oneself (and are known to be shared with lower forms of life).</t4546> <t4547>However, it seemed to Dorian Gray that the true nature of the senses had never been understood.</t4547> <t4548>The senses have been forced to remain wild and animalistic because the world has aimed to crush them by starving or to kill them through suffering.</t4548> <t4549>Yet, they should have become elements of a new spirituality, whose dominant characteristic is a refined intuition of beauty.</t4549>
<t4550>Dorian, as he looked back and examined the progress of humanity throughout history, felt a sense of loss.</t4550> <t4551>What had mankind given up!</t4551> <t4552>And all for nothing!</t4552> <t4553>Mad, stubborn denials rooted in fear, turning away, monstrous self-inflicted tortures, deprivations.</t4553> <t4554>Mankind had done these things out of ignorance, supposedly to avoid shame and degradation; yet the result of their choice had been a degradation far worse than what they had tried to escape.</t4554> <t4555>With its marvelous irony, nature had forced those who had withdrawn from the world to live alongside wild desert animals, giving monks the animals of the fields as companions.</t4555>
<t4556>Yes: Just as Lord Henry predicted, a new hedonism would emerge and recreate life anew; it is very strange that it would save life from the harsh, unattractive conservatism that has resurfaced today.</t4556> <t4557>During this new hedonism, it would naturally make use of thought.</t4557> <t4558>However, no theory or system that required the abandonment of passions and excitements would be adopted.</t4558> <t4559>Rather, its purpose would be to directly experience such sensations, not the bittersweet fruits of these life experiences.</t4559> <t4560>This movement would be unaware of both the aesthetism that freezes the senses and the vulgar debauchery that dulls them.</t4560> <t4561>It would teach people to focus on the moments of a life that consists of a single moment.</t4561>
<t4562>Among us, there are very few who do not wake up suddenly at dawn after those dreamless sleeps that almost push us to embrace death, or after a night filled with terrors and monstrous joys.</t4562> <t4563>In such nights, ghosts seep into the compartments of the mind that are even more frightening than realities, filled with the life force hidden in all monsters.</t4563> <t4564>It is this life force in the monsters that gives Gothic art its unending vitality.</t4564> <t4565>Isn't Gothic art actually considered a branch of art unique to those whose minds are afflicted with dream fever?</t4565>
<t4566>Yes, at such moments, white fingers gently slip inside through the curtains.</t4566> <t4567>These fingers seem to be trembling.</t4567> <t4568>And they seem to make the curtains ripple.</t4568> <t4569>Silent, dark shadows, cloaked in surreal forms, crawl and settle into the corners of the room.</t4569> <t4570>Outside, there is the rustling of birds among the leaves, and the sounds of people heading to work can be heard.</t4570> <t4571>The wind descends from the hills, and although it hesitates to wake those sleeping in the silent house, it roams around as if compelled to draw sleep out of its purple cave, sighing and sobbing.</t4571> <t4572>Dark, thin veils peel away one after another, opening step by step, objects regain their usual colors and shapes, and we watch as dawn recreates the world according to that ancient pattern.</t4572> <t4573>Pale reflections return to the mirrors.</t4573> <t4574>The flameless candelabras remain where we left them, and beside them, the half-opened book we read at night, the flower with a wired stem we pinned to our lapel at the ball, or the letter we are afraid to read—perhaps one we've read a hundred times.</t4574> <t4575>Nothing appears to have changed to our eyes.</t4575> <t4576>From the surreal shadows of the night, the real life we know emerges.</t4576> <t4577>We must pick it up from where we left off.</t4577>
<t4578>Then, the necessity to continue expending energy to turn the tiresome wheel of the same entrenched habits descends upon us like a cloud.</t4578> <t4579>We might perhaps be seized by a mad desire to open our eyes to a world reshaped solely for our pleasure in the darkness of night: a world where everything carries brand new colors and shapes, has changed, and contains other mysteries; a world that almost leaves no place for the past, where the conscious responsibility and regret of the past leave no residue, where joyful memories do not bring disappointment, and sweet memories do not bring bitterness.</t4579>
<t4580>It seemed to Dorian Gray that the true purpose of living –or one of the true purposes– was to be able to create worlds like these.</t4580> <t4581>Chasing after thrills that were both new and pleasurable, and possessed the "extraordinary" qualities he considered indispensable elements of romantic adventures, Dorian was actually adopting certain modes of thought that he knew were alien to his nature, allowing himself to be influenced by them indirectly.</t4581> <t4582>Then, so to speak, after absorbing their color and satisfying his intellectual curiosity, he would abandon them with a strange indifference.</t4582> <t4583>Such indifference is not at all unusual in a passionate character; in fact, according to some contemporary psychologists, such a disposition is considered a prerequisite for such a temperament.</t4583>
<t4584>There were rumors circulating that Dorian Gray was about to convert to the Catholic Church at one point.</t4584> <t4585>The fact is that the methods of this sect had always seemed very attractive to him.</t4585> <t4586>The Roman Catholic Church, with its daily sacrifices that it found more magnificent than all the sacrifices of the ancient world, its outright denial of the senses, as well as the simplicity of its elements and the unchanging inner anguish of the Human Tragedy it sought to symbolize, stirred Dorian's emotions.</t4586> <t4587>He enjoyed watching the priest in his tall, embroidered robe, kneeling on the cold marble floor: the priest opening the temple curtain with his white hands, cutting the sacred bread into the chalice in the guise of the Mass of the Passion of Man, and striking his chest for his sins, lifting the jewel-encrusted, lantern-shaped sacred bread container with the pale slice of bread inside it into the air.</t4587> <t4588>Sometimes Dorian was inclined to believe that this was indeed panis caelestis, the bread of angels.</t4588> <t4589>The incense burners that the children in lace and red garments, with serious expressions, tossed into the air like large, gilded flowers, subtly enchanted him.</t4589> <t4590>As he left the church, he would look curiously at those dark confession booths, and he would want to sit in the dim shadows of one of them, listening to the men and women whispering the true stories of their lives from behind the leaf screens.</t4590>
<t4591>However, he never made the mistake of officially adopting any religion or system that would restrict his mental development.</t4591> <t4592>He never fell into the error of mistaking a shelter for one night, or even an inn to take refuge in for a few hours of a night when the stars did not shine and the moon did not rise, for a house to live in.</t4592> <t4593>Mysticism, which has a wonderful effect of making ordinary things appear extraordinary to our eyes, and the mysterious antinomianism6 movement that often follows it for some reason, occupied him for a season.</t4593> <t4594>In another season, Dorian inclined towards the materialistic teachings of the Darwinismus7 movement in Germany.</t4594> <t4595>He took a strange pleasure in tracing the thoughts and feelings of a person to a pearly cell in the brain or a white nerve in the body.</t4595> <t4596>The idea that the soul was entirely dependent on certain bodily conditions—whether diseased or healthy, normal or abnormal—gave him satisfaction.</t4596>
<t4597>The thing is, as we mentioned earlier, no theory about life seemed as important to him as life itself.</t4597> <t4598>He was well aware of how barren intellectual theories could be when they were disconnected from action and experience.</t4598> <t4599>He knew that the senses also had spiritual mysteries to reveal, which were no less significant than those of the soul.</t4599>
<t4600>Thus, you see him studying perfumes, the secrets of perfume making, distilling fragrant oils, and burning aromatic resins from the Far East.</t4600><t4601>He observed that every change in the mind had a counterpart in sensory life and strove to uncover the true connection between them: What was it in the daily scent that made one mystical?</t4601><t4602>What was it in amber that inflamed emotions, in the scent of violets that revived memories of lost loves, in musk that disturbed the mind, in champaca that stimulated the imagination?</t4602><t4603>Dorian was developing a solid philosophy about perfumes and attempting to measure their various effects, studying fragrant roots, flowers laden with aromatic pollen, and melissas; fragrant, dense trees: the sickening hyacinths, the delirium-inducing hovenias, the aloe tree said to banish melancholy from the soul...</t4603>
<t4604>At one point, he devoted himself entirely to music.</t4604> <t4605>He organized very peculiar concerts in a long room with latticed windows, a ceiling painted red and gilded, and walls lacquered in olive green.</t4605> <t4606>In these recitals, wild Gypsies would extract wandering melodies from their small, multi-stringed instruments, dignified Tunisians wrapped in yellow shawls would pluck the taut strings of their enormous ouds, grinning black men would pound their copper drums with monotonous beats, and thin Indians with turbans on their heads, squatting on red prayer rugs, would enchant or pretend to enchant terrifying, long, poisonous, horned snakes by playing their long flutes made of reed or brass.</t4606> <t4607>When he couldn't be moved by Schubert's delicate harmony, Chopin's exquisite melancholy, or even Beethoven's magnificent melodies, the harsh intervals and shrill dissonances of barbaric music excited Dorian.</t4607> <t4608>He had collected the strangest instruments he could find from all corners of the world: from the tombs of vanished nations, from places where a handful of wild tribes had managed to survive after coming into contact with Western civilization.</t4608> <t4609>He loved to caress and try them out.</t4609> <t4610>He had acquired those mysterious Juruparis of the Rio Negro Indians, which women were not allowed to look at and young men could only see after undergoing fasting and flogging trials.</t4610> <t4611>He had the earthenware flutes of the Peruvians that chirped with bird-like high pitches, the flutes made of human bone that Alfonso de Ovalle heard in Chile, and the resonant jade stones found around Cuzco that produced indescribably beautiful sounds...</t4611> <t4612>He had painted gourds filled with pebbles that rattled when shaken; the long clarinets of the Mexicans that were played by sucking rather than blowing; the harsh-sounding turé of the Amazon natives, said to be heard from three leagues away, played by the sentinels who kept watch in the high trees all day; the teponaztli, carved from wood with two vibrating tongues, played with sticks coated in a gum made from plant latex; the yotl rattles of the Aztecs, clustered like grape bunches; and that huge drum seen by Bernal Diaz in the Mexican temple he entered with Cortez, which he vividly described for its mournful sound.</t4612> <t4613>Gray, captivated by the variety and striking nature of these instruments, took a peculiar pleasure in thinking that, like nature, art also created monsters, animal-shaped, and ugly-sounding things.</t4613>
<t4614>However, after a while, he grew tired of these as well, and found himself either alone or with Lord Henry in his opera box, listening to Tannhäuser in a state of ecstasy, discovering the tragedy of his own soul in the prelude of this grand work of art.</t4614>
<t4615>Once, he developed an interest in jewels.</t4615> <t4616>At a costume ball, he appeared dressed as the French Admiral Anne de Joyeuse, wearing a dress adorned with five hundred and sixty pearls.</t4616> <t4617>This fascination occupied him for years, and it wouldn't be an exaggeration to say it never faded.</t4617> <t4618>Often, he would spend an entire day taking out and putting back the precious stones he had collected: chrysoberyls that turned olive green to red under the lamp light, cymophanes with their silver thread-like lines, pistachio-colored peridots, rose-pink and wine-yellow topazes, fiery red rubies with their four-rayed twinkling stars, flame-red cinnamon stones, orange and purple rubies, and amethysts composed of alternating layers of ruby and sapphire.</t4618> <t4619>Dorian loved the broken rainbows within the star stones and the pearly white of the moonstones.</t4619> <t4620>He had bought three extraordinarily large and beautifully colored emeralds from Amsterdam; he also had a turquoise of the la vieille roche variety that was legendary among gem enthusiasts.</t4620>
<t4621>Dorian was discovering interesting stories about jewels.</t4621><t4622>For example, in Alphonso's "Clericals Disciplina," there was mention of a dragon with eyes made of real purple hyacinth stone.</t4622><t4623>In the exciting life story of Alexander, it was said that the Conqueror of Emathia saw snakes in the Jordan Valley with rings of real emeralds on their backs.</t4623><t4624>Philostratus described that a jewel was hidden in the brains of dragons, and that the monster would fall into a magical sleep when confronted with "golden letters and a red cloak," making it possible to kill it this way.</t4624><t4625>According to the famous alchemist Pierre de Boniface, diamonds had something that made a person invisible, and Indian agate had something that made one speak beautifully.</t4625><t4626>The Solomon stone soothed anger, the hyacinth stone induced sleep, and the amethyst dispelled the fumes of wine.</t4626><t4627>The garnet repelled devils and demons, and the hydropicus dimmed the color of the moon.</t4627><t4628>The selenite brightened and dimmed in accordance with the waxing and waning of the moon.</t4628><t4629>The effect of the meloseus stone, which ensured the capture of thieves, could only be activated by the blood of a boy.</t4629><t4630>Leonardus Camillus had seen a white stone used as an antidote being extracted from the brain of a newly killed frog.</t4630><t4631>The antidote stone found in the hearts of Arabian deer was an amulet that cured the plague.</t4631><t4632>According to Democritus, the aspilat stone found in the nests of birds in Arabia protected people from the dangers of fire.</t4632>
<t4633>The King of Ceylon had ridden through the city on horseback, carrying a large ruby, during his coronation ceremony.</t4633> <t4634>The garden gates of Priest King John’s palace were made of sardius inlaid with the horns of horned serpents so that no one could bring poison inside.</t4634> <t4635>Two golden apples, each containing a garnet, were hung on the eaves of its pointed roof, making the gold shine during the day and the garnet at night.</t4635> <t4636>According to what Lodge wrote in that strange adventure story called “An American Margarita,” it was possible to see “all the untouched ladies of the world” by looking into the magnificent mirrors made of chrysalis with silver carvings, garnet, sapphire, and emerald in the queen's room.</t4636> <t4637>Marco Polo, on the other hand, had seen the natives of Zipangu place rose-colored pearls in the mouths of their deceased.</t4637> <t4638>A sea monster, struck by a pearl at the bottom, killed the thief diver who brought it to King Perozes and mourned the lost pearl for seven months.</t4638> <t4639>Prokopius tells this story: Deceived by the Huns and led to a deep abyss, King Perozes threw the pearl far away, and despite Emperor Anastasius’s promise of five hundred okkas of gold in return, the pearl was never found again.</t4639> <t4640>The King of Malabar also showed a Venetian writer a rosary made of three hundred and four pearls, each representing one of the gods he worshipped.</t4640>
<t4641>VI.</t4641> <t4642>When Alexander's son, the Duke of Valentinois, visited the French King Louis, according to Brantôme, his horse was laden with gold leaf, and the double row of rubies on his headgear radiated an incredible light all around.</t4642> <t4643>The King of England, Charles, had spurs set with four hundred and twenty-one diamonds on his riding horse.</t4643> <t4644>II.</t4644> <t4645>Richard had a jacket valued at three thousand marks, covered with light pink rubies.</t4645> <t4646>King VIII.</t4646> <t4647>Henry, on his way to the Tower of London for his coronation, wore a jacket of embossed gold, a breastplate adorned with diamonds and other precious stones, and a massive "yoke" made of large pink rubies around his neck, as Hall writes.</t4647> <t4648>King I.</t4648> <t4649>James's favorites wore emerald earrings set in filigree gold frames.</t4649> <t4650>II.</t4650> <t4651>Edward gifted Piers Gaveston a suit of armor in red gold inlaid with hyacinth stones, a collar made of golden roses with turquoise centers, and a cap encrusted with pearls.</t4651> <t4652>II.</t4652> <t4653>Henry wore gloves embroidered with jewels up to the elbow; the glove he used for falconry was adorned with twelve rubies and fifty-two large blue pearls.</t4653> <t4654>The last Duke of Burgundy, Charles the Bold, had a ducal hat decorated with pear-shaped pearls and sapphires.</t4654>
<t4655>How splendid life once was!</t4655> <t4656>That pomp, that splendor was so magnificent!</t4656> <t4657>Even reading about the grandeur of the deceased was extraordinary.</t4657>
<t4658>Then Dorian turned his attention to the embroideries, to the tapestries that took the place of wall paintings in the hard-to-heat rooms of Northern European countries.</t4658> <t4659>While examining this subject –he had an extraordinary ability to fully dedicate himself to the subject at hand at the time– he was almost saddened as he thought about the wear and tear of time on beautiful and marvelous things.</t4659> <t4660>Fortunately, at least he had been able to stay away from it.</t4660> <t4661>Summers followed summers, yellow daffodils bloomed and withered countless times, nights filled with horror repeated their shameful stories, but Dorian never changed.</t4661> <t4662>No winter marred his beauty, nor did it wither that fresh bloom.</t4662> <t4663>Yet how different was the fate of tangible things!</t4663> <t4664>Where were they now?</t4664> <t4665>Where was that large, brightly colored shawl, embroidered by dark-skinned girls for the pleasure of Athena, depicting gods fighting giants?</t4665> <t4666>Where was that grand awning that Nero had stretched over the entrance of the Colosseum in Rome; that gigantic purple sail depicting Apollo in his chariot drawn by white horses with golden harnesses and the starry skies?</t4666> <t4667>Dorian longed to see those unique table napkins once embroidered for the Sun Priest: It was known that they depicted all the rare foods and drinks that could be served at feasts.</t4667> <t4668>Then there was King Chilperic's coffin cover embroidered with three hundred golden bees.</t4668> <t4669>And those strange robes that depicted lions, panthers, bears, dogs, forests, rocks, hunters...</t4669> <t4670>in short, everything a painter could copy from nature, which had drawn the ire of the Bishop of Pontus.</t4670> <t4671>And the jacket worn once by King Charles of Orleans, embroidered with the lines of a song that began with "Madame, je suis tout joyeux."</t4671> <t4672>The melody of the song was embroidered on the cuffs of the jacket, with each note, shown in the square style of the day, marked by four pearls.</t4672>
<t4673>Dorian had also read the description of the room in the Palace of Rheims prepared for the Burgundian Queen Joan, adorned with thirteen hundred and twenty-one parrots bearing the king's coat of arms on their wings and five hundred and sixty-one butterflies bearing the queen's coat of arms on their wings – all embroidered with gold thread.</t4673> <t4674>Catherine de Medicis had a mourning bed made for herself from black velvet sprinkled with crescent moon and sun embroideries.</t4674> <t4675>The bed's curtains were made of Damascus fabric with a pattern of wreaths covered with leaves on a gold and silver background, and fringes lined with pearls.</t4675> <t4676>The walls of the room where the bed stood were also adorned with rows of the queen's coats of arms made from cut black velvet on silver fabric.</t4676> <t4677>XIV.</t4677> <t4678>In Louis's room, there were statues of women about seven to eight meters high.</t4678> <t4679>The royal bed of the Polish King Sobieski was made of Izmir silver, with verses from the Quran inlaid with turquoise.</t4679> <t4680>Its legs were silver-gilded, finely carved, and adorned with countless jeweled and enameled medallions.</t4680> <t4681>It had been seized from the Turkish encampment near Vienna and had once housed the banner of Muhammad under its trembling canopy.</t4681>
<t4682>Here it is; for a whole year, Dorian dedicated himself to collecting the finest products that the arts of weaving and embroidery could find.</t4682> <t4683>Delicate Delhi muslins embroidered with gold threads, palm leaf patterns, and iridescent beetle wings; Dhaka muslins, known in the East for their transparency as "woven air," "running water," and "evening dews"; Java fabrics with strange patterns; Chinese curtains with intricate designs; tawny satins or books bound in blonde blue silks, printed with fleur de lys, birds, and human figures; Hungarian needlework veils; Georgian embroideries with gold coins; Japanese Fukusas with greenish gold threads and dazzling feathered birds.</t4683>
<t4684>Dorian had a profound curiosity about the vestments of the church, just as he did about everything related to its ceremonies.</t4684> <t4685>In the west-facing gallery of his house, he had collected many rare and beautiful examples of the attire worn by the Brides of Christ, stored in long cedar chests.</t4685> <t4686>These women, to conceal their pale bodies wasting away due to the sufferings they endured by their own will and the tortures they inflicted upon themselves, were compelled to wear purple silks, expensive linens, and adorn themselves with jewelry.</t4686> <t4687>Dorian also possessed a magnificent priest's robe made of Damascus work woven with gold thread and crimson silk, adorned with golden pomegranates among six-petaled flowers, with pineapples embroidered with seed pearls on either side.</t4687> <t4688>The belts were divided into segments depicting scenes from the life of the Virgin Mary, with her coronation illustrated on the hood.</t4688> <t4689>This was an Italian piece from the fifteenth century.</t4689> <t4690>There was also a robe made of green velvet, embroidered with acanthus leaves clustered in the shape of hearts; the details of the long-stemmed white flowers emerging from these leaves were embroidered with colored beads and gold thread.</t4690> <t4691>On the hood, there was an angel's head filled with gold thread embroidery.</t4691> <t4692>The belts were woven from red and gold silk, speckled with medallions of many saints and martyrs (including St.</t4692> <t4693>Sebastian).</t4693>
<t4694>Dorian also had many Catholic priest robes in his possession.</t4694> <t4695>These robes, made of amber-colored silk, blue silk and brocade with gold embroidery, yellow silk Damascus work with gold thread, were adorned with scenes depicting the Passion and Crucifixion of Jesus, as well as images of lions and peacocks.</t4695> <t4696>At the same time, Dorian had collected white satin bishop's robes decorated with tulip, dolphin, and fleur-de-lys patterns, pink silk Damascus work bishop's robes, red velvet, blue linen altar cloths, towels used in the Holy Communion, chalice covers, and the handkerchiefs said to have wiped Jesus' sweat on his way to the cross.</t4696> <t4697>There was something in the mystical purposes these objects served that stirred his imagination.</t4697> <t4698>Because all these treasures, or rather everything he had gathered in that magnificent house, were for Dorian Gray a means of oblivion: ways to escape, at least for a while, from the fear that sometimes seemed unbearably great to him.</t4698> <t4699>He had hung that terrifying portrait, in which he saw the true downfall of his life in its changing lines, on the wall of that locked, desolate room where he had spent much of his childhood, and had draped the purple funeral cloth embroidered with gold in front of it as a curtain.</t4699> <t4700>There were times when he would forget that disgusting, painted object for weeks by not going up to that room.</t4700> <t4701>Then he would regain the lightness and joy of his heart and devote himself once again to the joy of mere existence.</t4701> <t4702>Then, suddenly, in the middle of the night, he would secretly leave his house and go to the slums around Blue Gate Fields, staying until he was chased away.</t4702> <t4703>When he returned home, he would sit in front of the portrait.</t4703> <t4704>Sometimes he was filled with disgust towards the portrait and himself.</t4704> <t4705>Other times, succumbing to the pride of individuality that constitutes half the allure of sin, he would secretly smile with a sense of hidden satisfaction in front of that grotesque image that actually had to bear the burden he deserved.</t4705>
<t4706>Realizing that he could not bear to be away from England for long periods after a few years, he gave up both the villa he shared with Lord Henry in Trouville and the small white house with high-walled courtyard they visited for several winters in Algeria.</t4706> <t4707>He could not bear to be separated from painting, which was such an inseparable part of his life.</t4707> <t4708>Despite the grille he had installed on the door of the room, he feared that someone might find their way into the room in his absence.</t4708>
<t4709>Dorian knew that anyone entering the room wouldn't understand anything anyway.</t4709> <t4710>The portrait, despite all its hideousness and ugliness, still resembled him, but what would it mean to those who saw it?</t4710> <t4711>Dorian could laugh off those who tried to mock him.</t4711> <t4712>He hadn't painted the portrait himself!</t4712> <t4713>What did it matter to him that it looked so vile and disgraceful?</t4713> <t4714>Even if Dorian told the truth, would anyone believe him?</t4714>
<t4715>He was always afraid.</t4715> <t4716>Sometimes, while he was enjoying himself with the young socialites from his own class at his large house in Nottinghamshire, astonishing this provincial environment with the extreme luxury and dazzling splendor of his lifestyle, he would suddenly leave his guests, rush to the city to make sure that the door to the room had not been tampered with and that the portrait was still in its place.</t4716> <t4717>What if the portrait was stolen?</t4717> <t4718>The very thought of it made Dorian shudder with terror.</t4718> <t4719>That would be when the whole world would learn his secret.</t4719> <t4720>Perhaps those around him were already beginning to sense this secret.</t4720>
<t4721>Because although many were captivated by his charm, there were also those who did not like him.</t4721> <t4722>His membership in a club in the West End district, which he was fully entitled to join due to his family and social status, was almost blocked as a result of a secret ballot.</t4722> <t4723>It was said that once, when a friend brought him to the smoking room of the Churchill Club, the Duke of Berwick and another gentleman stood up and walked out with a meaningful gesture.</t4723> <t4724>After he turned twenty-five, strange rumors about him began to circulate.</t4724> <t4725>It was said that he was seen fighting with foreign sailors in a shabby tavern in a remote corner of the Whitechapel district, that he mingled with thieves and counterfeiters, and that he knew their trade secrets.</t4725> <t4726>He had gained a bad reputation for disappearing without reason.</t4726> <t4727>When he returned to society, many people whispered in corners, smiled contemptuously as they passed by, or scrutinized him with cold, piercing looks as if determined to learn his secret.</t4727>
<t4728>Dorian didn't even care about such insolence and disrespect, of course.</t4728> <t4729>The open-hearted, agile, cheerful attitudes, the friendly, childlike smile, and the endless sweetness of that marvelous youth that never faded from him were, in the eyes of many, the most sufficient response to the slanders against him – because they called these rumors slander.</t4729> <t4730>On the other hand, it was noticeable that some of those who were most intimate with him started to avoid him after a while.</t4730> <t4731>It was observed that women who had fallen madly in love with him, who had faced all the condemnation of society for his sake, and who had defied traditions, turned pale either from shame or horror when he entered the room.</t4731>
<t4732>The scandals whispered from ear to ear only served to increase his strange, dangerous allure in the eyes of many.</t4732><t4733>His great wealth was also a certain source of security for him.</t4733><t4734>Society, at least the society of civilized nations, is never willing to believe anything said against someone who is both rich, attractive, and interesting.</t4734><t4735>It has an instinctive belief that the rules of courtesy are more important than the rules of morality, and in its view, even the greatest respectability is less important than employing a good chef.</t4735><t4736>After all, what good is it to know that someone who sets a poor table and serves inferior wine is impeccable in their private life?</t4736><t4737>As Lord Henry once said on this subject, not even the highest virtues can atone for the sin of the main course arriving cold at the table!</t4737><t4738>We believe his view is very well-founded.</t4738><t4739>Because the fundamental laws of high society and the fundamental laws of art are one and the same, or should be.</t4739><t4740>Form is an absolutely indispensable element for society.</t4740><t4741>This form must possess the dignity and insubstantiality of a ceremony and combine the artificial nature of a romantic play with the wit and beauty that make such plays endearing to us.</t4741><t4742>Is artificiality bad?</t4742><t4743>I don't think so.</t4743><t4744>It is merely a method that allows us to multiply and diversify our personalities.</t4744>
<t4745>More precisely, this was Dorian Gray's view.</t4745> <t4746>He was astonished by the shallowness of those who saw the ego in mankind as something simple, permanent, reliable, and singular.</t4746> <t4747>In his eyes, a human was a being with countless senses, carrying within them mysterious legacies of thoughts and feelings, hiding the marks of the dreadful diseases of the dead in their very flesh, a complex creature that transformed from form to form.</t4747> <t4748>Dorian loved wandering through the bare, cold picture gallery of his country house, looking at the portraits of those whose blood ran in his own veins.</t4748> <t4749>There was Philip Herbert.</t4749> <t4750>In his book Memoirs on the Reigns of Queen Elizabeth and King James, Francis Osborne described him as someone "favored by the Court for his handsome face but who lost his handsomeness quickly."</t4750> <t4751>Perhaps Dorian occasionally lived the life of this young Herbert.</t4751> <t4752>Could a strange, poisonous microbe have passed from body to body and reached his own?</t4752> <t4753>Was it a faint memory of that lost beauty that influenced him to make that mad wish, which changed his life so much, while he was idly standing in Basil Hallward's studio, seemingly for no reason?</t4753> <t4754>There stood Sir Anthony Sherard, in his embroidered red trousers, jeweled jacket, gilded armor collar and cuffs, with his silver and black crest at his feet.</t4754> <t4755>What inheritance had he left behind?</t4755> <t4756>Had sin and shame been passed down to Dorian from this man, who was the lover of Giovanna of Naples?</t4756> <t4757>Were Dorian's actions merely the unfulfilled dreams of the dead man?</t4757> <t4758>Here too, Lady Elizabeth Devereux was smiling from the canvas that had begun to fade, with her brocade hood, pearl-studded bodice, and pink slashed puffed sleeves.</t4758> <t4759>In her right hand, she held a flower, and with her left hand, she held a collar enameled with pink and white roses.</t4759> <t4760>On a table beside her, there was a mandolin and an apple.</t4760> <t4761>Large ribbons were placed on those small, pointed shoes.</t4761> <t4762>Dorian knew her life story and the strange rumors about her lovers.</t4762> <t4763>Had he inherited some of her traits?</t4763> <t4764>Those almond-shaped eyes with heavy lids seemed to gaze at him curiously.</t4764> <t4765>And what about George Willoughby, with his powdered hair and absurdly placed beauty patches?</t4765> <t4766>How malevolent he looked!</t4766> <t4767>His face was devilish, dark, and his sensual lips seemed twisted in disdain.</t4767> <t4768>Thin lace ruffles fell over those fleshless, yellow hands, heavily laden with rings.</t4768> <t4769>He was an eighteenth-century fop and had been friends with Lord Ferrars in his youth.</t4769> <t4770>And what of the second Lord Beckenham, a companion of the Prince Regent in his wildest days and a witness to the secret marriage with Mrs. Fitzherbert?</t4770> <t4771>How arrogant and handsome he was with his curly chestnut hair and insolent stance!</t4771> <t4772>What fiery passions had he passed on to Dorian?</t4772> <t4773>Everyone had considered him immoral.</t4773> <t4774>He was the ringleader of the orgies at Carlton House.</t4774> <t4775>Yet, the star of the Garter shone on his chest.</t4775> <t4776>Beside him hung the portrait of his wife, a pale, thin woman dressed in black.</t4776> <t4777>Her blood also flowed in Dorian's veins.</t4777> <t4778>How interesting all this was!</t4778> <t4779>Then, there was his own mother, with a face resembling Lady Hamilton, her lips moist from wine.</t4779> <t4780>Dorian knew what he had inherited from her.</t4780> <t4781>He had taken her beauty and her passion for the beauty of those around her.</t4781> <t4782>His mother smiled at him in the loose gown of a Bacchante.</t4782> <t4783>There were vine leaves in her hair.</t4783> <t4784>Purple spilled from the goblet she held.</t4784> <t4785>The carnations in the painting had withered, but the depth and brightness of the color in the woman's eyes were still extraordinary.</t4785> <t4786>Those eyes seemed to follow Dorian wherever he went.</t4786>
<t4787>On the other hand, just as a person has ancestors from their lineage, they also have ancestors in the literary world who, in terms of type and disposition, are closer to them than the others, and one could more distinctly perceive their influence.</t4787> <t4788>Sometimes it seemed to Dorian as if the entirety of human history consisted solely of his own biography: with its situations and actions, not as he lived them, but as his imagination created them for him, as he envisioned them in his mind and passions.</t4788> <t4789>It felt as though he had known all those different, formidable individuals who had passed through the world stage; those who made sin so magnificent and evil so mysterious.</t4789> <t4790>It was as if their lives in the past – how, it is unknown – were his own life.</t4790>
<t4791>The hero of that marvelous novel, which had so profoundly affected his life, had also harbored the same strange fantasies.</t4791> <t4792>According to what he recounted in the seventh chapter, he had sat in a garden on the island of Capri, in the guise of Tiberius, reading the scandalous books of Elephantis, with a wreath on his head to protect against lightning strikes, surrounded by dwarfs, peacocks, and the music of a flutist mocking a priest.</t4792> <t4793>As Caligula, he had indulged in debauchery with stable boys in green shirts in the palace's courtyard, and had dined with a jewel-adorned horse from an ivory manger.</t4793> <t4794>As Domitian, he had wandered through a corridor lined with marble mirrors, searching with sunken eyes for the shadow of the dagger that would end his life; sick and fallen with that dreadful taedium vitae, the weariness of life that befalls those to whom life has spared nothing, he had watched the bloody chaos in the arena through a transparent emerald he wore over his eye; and as he rode in a mother-of-pearl and purple-colored chariot drawn by silver-shod mules down Pomegranate Street towards the House of God, he had heard the people shout, "Nero Caesar!"</t4794> <t4795>As Elagabalus, he had painted his face with colorful paints; mingled with women and spun silk; and had brought the Moon from Carthage to marry it mystically with the Sun.</t4795>
<t4796>Dorian would read this extraordinary chapter over and over again; and the two chapters that followed it as well.</t4796> <t4797>On these pages, the terrifying and beautiful images of famous individuals, driven mad and monstrous by evil passions, violence, and weariness, were depicted as if shown in a strange wall tapestry or an enameled decoration: the Duke of Milan, Filippo, who killed his wife and then painted the lips of her corpse with a red poison so that her lover would receive death from the dead; II.</t4797> <t4798>Paul, also known as Formosus due to his pride, a Venetian named Pietro Barbi who obtained his crown, valued at two thousand florins, in exchange for a dreadful sin; Gian Maria Visconti, who hunted humans with hounds, and whose corpse, after being killed, was covered with roses by a prostitute who had loved him; Borgia on his white horse, with Brother's Blood beside him, and Peretto's bloodstain on his cloak; the one whose beauty matched his immorality, who decorated his tent made of white and red silk with water nymphs and centaurs to welcome Leonora of Aragon, and in this feast, dipped a boy in gold to serve as a prize or a substitute for Hylas, VI.</t4798> <t4799>Sixtus's son and favorite, the young Archbishop of Florence, Cardinal Pietro Riario; Ezzelin, who could only escape his melancholy by watching death scenes, who was as addicted to red blood as others were to red wine, rumored to be the devil's son and to have used loaded dice while gambling with his father for his soul; Giambattista Cibo, mockingly called "Innocent," who had the blood of three young men injected into his numbed veins by a Jewish doctor; Sigismondo Malatesta, lover of Isotta and Lord of Rimini, who strangled Polyssena with a handkerchief and poisoned Ginevra d'Esté with a cup of emerald, who, for a shameful passion, founded a church for idol worship, considered an enemy of both man and God in Rome, and whose images were burned; VI.</t4799> <t4800>Charles, who was warned by a leper that he was about to go mad due to his insane love for his brother's wife, and when his mind became diseased and deranged, found solace only in Arabian playing cards illustrated with images of love, death, and madness; Grifonetto Baglioni, who killed Astorre and his wife, Simonetto and his servant, and whose beauty, as he lay dying in the yellow square of Perugia, moved even those who hated him to tears, and who was finally blessed by Atalanta, who had cursed him, with his ornate vest and jeweled cap, and his hair in hyacinth curls.</t4800>
<t4801>There was a spine-chilling allure in all of this.</t4801> <t4802>Dorian saw them at night, and during the day his mind was disturbed by these images.</t4802> <t4803>The Renaissance era had witnessed various, strange methods of poisoning: Helmets, a burning torch, embroidered gloves, jeweled fans, gilded perfume bottles, and amber necklaces were used in poisoning.</t4803> <t4804>But Dorian Gray was poisoned by a book.</t4804> <t4805>Dorian only saw evil as a means to realize the concept of beauty in his mind.</t4805>

<t4827>The twelfth chapter</t4827>
<t4828>Dorian would often recall later that the event took place on November ninth, on the eve of his thirty-eighth birthday.</t4828>
<t4829>On his way back from the dinner he had at Lord Henry's house, he was walking home around eleven o'clock.</t4829> <t4830>He was wrapped in his fur coat, because it was a cold, foggy night.</t4830> <t4831>A man passed by quickly through the fog, near Grosvenor Square and South Audley Street.</t4831> <t4832>He had the collar of his long, gray, loose coat turned up and was carrying a bag in his hand.</t4832> <t4833>Dorian recognized him.</t4833> <t4834>It was Basil Hallward.</t4834> <t4835>A strange fear, the cause of which he could not understand, seized Dorian.</t4835> <t4836>Without showing any sign of recognition, he quickened his steps in the direction of his own house.</t4836>
<t4837>However, Hallward had seen him.</t4837> <t4838>Dorian heard him first stop, then follow after him.</t4838> <t4839>A few minutes later, the painter had grabbed Dorian's arm.</t4839>
<t4840>“Dorian! What an incredible chance! I have been waiting for you in your library since nine o'clock.</t4840> <t4841>Finally, I took pity on your poor tired servant and told him to go, and you to sleep.</t4841> <t4842>I am leaving for Paris on the midnight train and I especially wanted to see you before I go.</t4842> <t4843>I thought the person who just passed by looked like you, or rather like your fur coat.</t4843> <t4844>Still, I wasn't sure.</t4844> <t4845>Didn't you recognize me?</t4845><t4846>”</t4846>
<t4847>“My dear Basil, in this fog? I can't even recognize Grosvenor Square.</t4847> <t4848>If I'm not mistaken, my house should be somewhere around here, but I'm not very sure about that.</t4848> <t4849>I'm truly sorry that you're a traveler, because it's been years since we last met.</t4849> <t4850>But I suppose you'll be back soon, won't you?</t4850><t4851>”</t4851>
<t4852>“No, I will stay abroad for six months.</t4852> <t4853>My intention is to rent a studio in Paris and lock myself in until I finish the painting I have designed in my mind.</t4853> <t4854>But what I want is not to talk about myself.</t4854> <t4855>We came to your door.</t4855> <t4856>Let me in for five minutes.</t4856> <t4857>I have something to tell you.</t4857><t4858>”</t4858>
<t4859>“I would be very happy, but won't you miss your train?” asked Dorian as he lazily climbed the steps and opened the door with his key.</t4859>
<t4860>The light of the lantern was trying to pierce through the fog.</t4860> <t4861>Looking at his watch, the painter said, "I still have time."</t4861> <t4862>"The train leaves at twelve fifteen, it's only eleven now.</t4862> <t4863>When we met earlier, I was on my way to your club to find you.</t4863> <t4864>I don't have any luggage issues either, because I sent the heavy things ahead.</t4864> <t4865>I only took this bag with me.</t4865> <t4866>I'll easily make it to Victoria Station in twenty minutes.</t4866><t4867>"</t4867>
<t4868>Dorian smiled at him.</t4868> <t4869>"Just the kind of journey fit for a famous painter!</t4869> <t4870>A travel bag and a cloth coat!</t4870> <t4871>Come on in, or the fog will fill the house.</t4871> <t4872>Don't talk about serious matters!</t4872> <t4873>Nothing is taken seriously these days.</t4873> <t4874>Or rather, nothing should be.</t4874><t4875>"</t4875>
<t4876>Hallward shook his head as he entered and followed Dorian to the library.</t4876> <t4877>In the large open fireplace here, a wood fire was crackling loudly.</t4877> <t4878>Lamps were lit, and a Flemish silver drink box was placed on a small inlaid table.</t4878> <t4879>Inside were large crystal glasses with soda bottles with siphons.</t4879>
<t4880>"You see, Dorian, the servant treated me very well.</t4880> <t4881>She gave me whatever I wanted, even offered me those expensive, gold-tipped cigarettes of yours.</t4881> <t4882>Quite a hospitable type.</t4882> <t4883>I liked her much more than that old French valet.</t4883> <t4884>By the way, what happened to that Frenchman?</t4884><t4885>"</t4885>
<t4886>Dorian shrugged his shoulders.</t4886> <t4887>"I think he married Lady Radley's personal maid.</t4887> <t4888>He even opened a shop for her in Paris called 'The English Tailor,' I believe.</t4888> <t4889>From what I hear, Anglomania is quite popular there nowadays.</t4889> <t4890>French nonsense, in my opinion, don't you think?</t4890> <t4891>Still...</t4891> <t4892>You know?..</t4892> <t4893>He wasn't actually a bad servant.</t4893> <t4894>I never liked him, but there was never any reason for me to complain.</t4894> <t4895>People often get caught up in ridiculous notions.</t4895> <t4896>In fact, the poor man was very devoted to me; he was very upset when I let him go, I think.</t4896> <t4897>Would you like another brandy and soda?</t4897> <t4898>Or would you prefer white wine with soda water?</t4898> <t4899>I always drink white wine with soda water.</t4899> <t4900>There must be some in the other room.</t4900><t4901>"</t4901>
<t4902>The painter took off his cap and coat, throwing them on top of the bag he had left in a corner, and replied, "Thank you, I won't have anything else."</t4902> <t4903>"Look here, my friend, I wanted to have a serious talk with you.</t4903> <t4904>Don't make such a face.</t4904> <t4905>You're making my job completely difficult.</t4905><t4906>"</t4906>
<t4907>Dorian asked sulkily, "What is it that you want to talk about?"</t4907> <t4908>"I hope it is not about me.</t4908> <t4909>I am tired of myself tonight.</t4909> <t4910>I want to be someone else.</t4910><t4911>"</t4911>
<t4912>"It's about you."</t4912> <t4913>Hallward replied in that thick, serious voice.</t4913> <t4914>"I absolutely must tell you.</t4914> <t4915>It will only take half an hour of your time.</t4915><t4916>"</t4916>
<t4917>Dorian sighed and lit a cigarette.</t4917> <t4918>“Half an hour!” he muttered.</t4918>
<t4919>“What I am asking from you is not much, Dorian.</t4919> <t4920>I am speaking entirely for your own good.</t4920> <t4921>I think it is very important for you to know that extremely bad things are being said about you in London.</t4921><t4922>”</t4922>
<t4923>“I don't want to know any of it.</t4923> <t4924>I love gossip about others, but I have no interest in gossip about myself.</t4924> <t4925>It lacks the allure of being new and different.</t4925><t4926>”</t4926>
<t4927>“You have to care, Dorian.</t4927> <t4928>Every gentleman values his own dignity.</t4928> <t4929>You can't enjoy everyone talking about you as a vile, despicable, disgusting person.</t4929> <t4930>Of course, you have your position, wealth, and so on, but position and wealth aren't everything.</t4930> <t4931>Let me tell you, I don't believe these rumors in the slightest.</t4931> <t4932>Or rather, when I see you, I find it hard to believe.</t4932> <t4933>Sin is something written on a person's face.</t4933> <t4934>It can't be hidden.</t4934> <t4935>Sometimes people talk about others' bad habits behind the scenes.</t4935> <t4936>There's no such thing!</t4936> <t4937>If a man has a bad habit, it immediately shows: in the lines of his mouth, the roundness of his eyelids, even the shape of his hands.</t4937> <t4938>Last year, someone... I won't name him, you know him...</t4938> <t4939>came to me to have his portrait done.</t4939> <t4940>I hadn't seen him before; I've learned a lot about him since, but at the time I knew nothing.</t4940> <t4941>He offered me an exorbitant amount of money.</t4941> <t4942>I refused his offer.</t4942> <t4943>There was something about the shape of his fingers that I hated.</t4943> <t4944>I now know that my intuitions about him were very accurate.</t4944> <t4945>He leads a disgusting life...</t4945> <t4946>But you, Dorian, with your clear, innocent, radiant face, with your marvelous, smooth youth...</t4946> <t4947>I can't believe anything said against you.</t4947> <t4948>However, I see you very rarely, you don't come to my studio anymore.</t4948> <t4949>When I'm away from you, hearing those terrible things everyone whispers behind your back, I don't know what to think.</t4949> <t4950>Dorian, why does a man like the Duke of Berwick leave the room at the club when you enter?</t4950> <t4951>Why do many respectable gentlemen in London neither visit you nor invite you?</t4951> <t4952>You used to be friends with Lord Staveley.</t4952> <t4953>We had dinner together last week.</t4953> <t4954>In passing, your name came up, under the pretext of the miniatures you lent to the exhibition at the Dudley Gallery.</t4954> <t4955>Staveley curled his lip and said that while your tastes in art might be very refined, you were the kind of man no decent young girl should be allowed to know, and no respectable woman should even sit in the same room with.</t4955> <t4956>I reminded him that I was your friend; I asked what he meant.</t4956> <t4957>He told me.</t4957> <t4958>He told me in front of everyone, by name.</t4958> <t4959>It was terrible.</t4959> <t4960>Why does your friendship bring ruin to young men, Dorian?</t4960> <t4961>Henry Ashton from the Guards had to leave England because of the slander against him.</t4961> <t4962>You were inseparable.</t4962> <t4963>And what about Adrian Singleton, the terrible fate that befell him?</t4963> <t4964>And the career of Lord Kent's only son?</t4964> <t4965>Yesterday, on St.</t4965> <t4966>James Street, I ran into his father.</t4966> <t4967>The poor man seemed crushed by shame and sorrow.</t4967> <t4968>And the young Duke of Perth? What kind of life is he leading now?</t4968> <t4969>What respectable person would befriend him?</t4969><t4970>”</t4970>
<t4971>Dorian bit his lip and said, "Enough, Basil."</t4971><t4972>"You are talking about things you know nothing about."</t4972><t4973>There was an infinite contempt in his voice.</t4973><t4974>"You are asking why Berwick left the room when I entered.</t4974><t4975>It is because I know everything about his life; not because he knows everything about mine.</t4975><t4976>How can his record be clean with that kind of blood running through his veins?</t4976><t4977>You asked me about Henry Ashton and young Perth.</t4977><t4978>Did I teach one those vile passions and the other that moral depravity?</t4978><t4979>If Kent's foolish son picked up a woman from the street, what is it to me? Was I supposed to set Adrian Singleton on the right path when he forged his friend's signature on a note while I was beside him?</t4979><t4980>I know that in England, no one has a bone in their tongue.</t4980><t4981>The middle classes express their moral prejudices at their uncouth tables.</t4981><t4982>The upper classes whisper about supposed immoralities to appear as if they are part of society; they pretend to know closely the people they slander.</t4982><t4983>In this country, as soon as someone is a bit distinguished, a bit intellectual, they immediately become the subject of the common people's gossip...</t4983><t4984>Well, what about the lives of those who present themselves as symbols of morality?</t4984><t4985>My dear friend, do not forget that we live in a country that is the homeland of hypocrisy.</t4985><t4986>"</t4986>
<t4987>Hallward scolded, "Dorian, that's not the issue."</t4987> <t4988>"I'm not unaware that England has its bad sides.</t4988> <t4989>The structure of English society is fundamentally flawed.</t4989> <t4990>That's why I want you to be pure and superior.</t4990> <t4991>You haven't been able to be so until now.</t4991> <t4992>We have the right to judge a person by the influence they have on their friends.</t4992> <t4993>It's as if your friends are losing all sense of honor, goodness, and cleanliness.</t4993> <t4994>You instill in them a frenzy of pleasure and indulgence.</t4994> <t4995>They've all fallen into the depths of an abyss.</t4995> <t4996>You dragged them there.</t4996> <t4997>Yes, you dragged them, yet you can still smile and brush it off, just like you're doing right now.</t4997> <t4998>And there's something even worse than that.</t4998> <t4999>I know that you and Harry are inseparable.</t4999> <t5000>If for no other reason, you should have avoided bringing disgrace to his sister's name just because of that.</t5000><t5001>"</t5001>
<t5002>"Take it easy, Basil.</t5002> <t5003>You are going too far.</t5003><t5004>"</t5004>
<t5005>“I have to speak, and you will have to listen whether you want to or not.</t5005><t5006>When you met Lady Gwendolen, her name was spotless.</t5006><t5007>But now, is there a single family woman in London who would take a walk with her in the park?</t5007><t5008>What are you saying, even her children are not allowed to sit with her.</t5008><t5009>Then there are other rumors: people have seen you secretly leaving notorious houses; it is observed that you go to the most vile, dirtiest dens of debauchery in London in disguise.</t5009><t5010>Are these true?</t5010><t5011>Could they be true?</t5011><t5012>When I first heard, I laughed it off.</t5012><t5013>Now, as I hear more, my hair stands on end.</t5013><t5014>And your house in the countryside, what goes on there?</t5014><t5015>Dorian, you don’t know what people are saying behind your back!</t5015><t5016>I am not going to claim that I don’t want to give you advice.</t5016><t5017>I will never forget, Harry once said that everyone who sets out to mentor starts by saying this and then contradicts it.</t5017><t5018>I intend to teach you wisdom.</t5018><t5019>I want you to have a respectable reputation, a clean record.</t5019><t5020>I want you to get rid of those horrible people you are involved with.</t5020><t5021>Don’t shrug your shoulders like that.</t5021><t5022>Don’t be so indifferent.</t5022><t5023>You are extraordinarily influential.</t5023><t5024>Use this influence for good, not evil.</t5024><t5025>They say that everyone you associate with has their morals corrupted.</t5025><t5026>They say that once you step over the threshold of a house, disgrace and shame inevitably follow.</t5026><t5027>Is it true or not, I don’t know.</t5027><t5028>How should I know?</t5028><t5029>But this is what they say about you.</t5029><t5030>They say things that leave no room for doubt, Lord Glouchester was one of my closest friends when he was at Oxford.</t5030><t5031>His wife wrote him a letter while she was alone on her deathbed at their villa in Mentone; he showed it to me.</t5031><t5032>It was the most horrifying confession I have ever read; it implicated your name.</t5032><t5033>I told my friend that it was ridiculous, that I knew you very well, that you could never do such a thing in the world.</t5033><t5034>Know you?</t5034><t5035>Do I really know you?</t5035><t5036>To answer that, I would need to see your soul.</t5036><t5037>”</t5037>
<t5038>Dorian Gray, "See my soul, huh!" he muttered, jumping up from his seat.</t5038> <t5039>His face had turned pale with fear.</t5039>
<t5040>Hallward replied seriously, with a deep tone of sadness in his voice, "Yes."</t5040> <t5041>"To see your soul.</t5041> <t5042>But only God can do that.</t5042><t5043>"</t5043>
<t5044>Dorian, with a pained, mocking laugh, grabbed a lamp from the table and shouted, "You will see with your own eyes, tonight!"</t5044> <t5045>"Walk! It is your handiwork anyway.</t5045> <t5046>Why shouldn't you see it?</t5046> <t5047>Later, if you wish, you can tell the whole world.</t5047> <t5048>No one will believe you, anyway.</t5048> <t5049>Even if they do, they will like me even more because of it.</t5049> <t5050>Even if you sit and give dreary speeches, I know our age better than you do.</t5050> <t5051>Walk, I told you.</t5051> <t5052>Enough of your prattling about moral decay.</t5052> <t5053>Now you will see it face to face!</t5053><t5054>"</t5054>
<t5055>In every word that fell from her lips, there was the madness of arrogance.</t5055> <t5056>She stomped her foot on the ground with a childish insolence.</t5056> <t5057>The thought of sharing her secret with someone else, knowing that the man who painted the portrait, which was the beginning of all her shame, would carry the terrible memory of his work as a burden on his shoulders for life, gave her a chilling delight.</t5057>
<t5058>The painter leaned in closer, fixing his gaze deep into his stern eyes, and added, "Yes."</t5058> <t5059>"I will show you my soul.</t5059> <t5060>You will see what you thought only God could see.</t5060><t5061>"</t5061>
<t5062>Hallward took a step back, shouting, "You are sinning, Dorian!"</t5062> <t5063>"Don't talk like that.</t5063> <t5064>What you are saying is terrible, and nonsense.</t5064><t5065>"</t5065>
<t5066>"Is that what you think?"</t5066> <t5067>Dorian laughed again.</t5067>
<t5068>“I know it is so.</t5068> <t5069>As for what I told you tonight; I said it for your own good.</t5069> <t5070>I have always been your most reliable friend, you know this.</t5070><t5071>”</t5071>
<t5072>“Don't push me.</t5072> <t5073>Finish what you were saying.</t5073><t5074>”</t5074>
<t5075>A painful expression briefly crossed the painter's face.</t5075> <t5076>Hallward paused for a moment, then was overwhelmed by a deep sense of pity.</t5076> <t5077>After all, what right did he have to interfere in Dorian Gray's life?</t5077> <t5078>If Dorian had done even a fraction of what was said about him, who knows what he had endured!</t5078>
<t5079>Hallward straightened up and walked towards the fireplace, where he stood and looked at the frost-like ashes of the burning logs, and the heart-like core of the fire.</t5079>
<t5080>Dorian said in a firm, clear voice, "I am waiting, Basil."</t5080>
<t5081>The painter turned towards him.</t5081> <t5082>“What I have to say is this: You must give me an explanation regarding these disgusting accusations directed at you.</t5082> <t5083>If you tell me they are completely fabricated, I will believe you.</t5083> <t5084>Deny them, Dorian, deny them all!</t5084> <t5085>Can't you see what I've been through?</t5085> <t5086>Good God, don't tell me you are a wicked, immoral, disgraceful person!</t5086><t5087>”</t5087>
<t5088>Dorian Gray smiled.</t5088> <t5089>His lips curled in a contemptuous smile.</t5089> <t5090>The young man, with composure,</t5090>
<t5091>“Come upstairs, Basil,” he said.</t5091> <t5092>“I have a diary where I note down my daily life, but I never take it out of the room where I write it.</t5092> <t5093>If you come, I'll show it to you too.</t5093><t5094>”</t5094>
<t5095>"I'll come, Dorian, since you want me to.</t5095> <t5096>Anyway, I've missed my train as well.</t5096> <t5097>It's not important.</t5097> <t5098>I'll go tomorrow.</t5098> <t5099>Just don't make me read anything tonight.</t5099> <t5100>All I want is a clear answer to my question.</t5100><t5101>"</t5101>
<t5102>"This answer will be given to you above.</t5102> <t5103>I can't say it here.</t5103> <t5104>You won't need to read for long either.</t5104><t5105>"</t5105>
<t5106>Chapter Thirteen</t5106>
<t5107>Dorian Gray stepped outside and began to climb the stairs; Basil Hallward was following him.</t5107> <t5108>As people instinctively do at night, they were walking quietly.</t5108> <t5109>The lamp cast improbable shadows on the walls of the staircase, and the wind picking up outside rattled some of the windows.</t5109>
<t5110>At the top landing, Dorian placed the lamp on the ground, took out the key, and turned it in the lock.</t5110> <t5111>In a low voice,</t5111>
<t5112>"Are you resisting learning, Basil?" he asked.</t5112>
<t5113>“Yes.</t5113><t5114>”</t5114>
<t5115>Dorian smiled, "I am very glad," he said.</t5115> <t5116>Then, in a slightly harsh voice, he added, "If there is one person in the world who has the right to know everything about me, it is you.</t5116> <t5117>The role you play in my life is greater than you think."</t5117> <t5118>Then he picked up the lamp from the floor, opened the door, and went inside.</t5118> <t5119>A cold draft brushed past them, and the light of the lamp flared up for a moment with a sooty orange flame.</t5119> <t5120>Dorian shivered.</t5120> <t5121>"Close the door," he whispered, placing the lamp on the table.</t5121>
<t5122>Hallward looked around with a surprised expression on his face.</t5122> <t5123>The room seemed to have been unused for years.</t5123> <t5124>A faded Flemish tapestry, a picture with a curtain in front of it, an old Italian chest, an almost empty bookcase...</t5124> <t5125>These seemed to be the only things in the room; and a table and a chair.</t5125> <t5126>While Dorian Gray lit the half-burnt candle on the mantelpiece, Hallward saw that everything was covered in dust and the carpet was full of holes.</t5126> <t5127>A rat was scurrying behind the wall paneling.</t5127> <t5128>There was a damp, musty smell in the air.</t5128>
<t5129>"So you think only God can see a person's soul, do you Basil?</t5129> <t5130>Draw that curtain, and you will see my soul.</t5130><t5131>"</t5131>
<t5132>The voice that spoke was cold and cruel.</t5132> <t5133>Frowning, Hallward said, "Dorian, you are either mad or pretending,"</t5133>
<t5134>"Aren't you opening it?</t5134> <t5135>Then it's up to me," said the young man, pulling the curtain from its rod and throwing it to the ground.</t5135>
<t5136>When the painter saw the hideous face grinning at him from the canvas in that dim light, a cry of horror escaped his lips.</t5136> <t5137>There was something in the expression of that face that filled him with disgust and dread.</t5137> <t5138>Good God! The thing in front of him was the face of Dorian Gray.</t5138> <t5139>The dreadful influence that had settled on the portrait –what could it be?–</t5139> <t5140>had not yet completely ruined that exquisite beauty.</t5140> <t5141>There was still a bit of golden shimmer in the thinning hair, and a bit of redness in that sensual mouth.</t5141> <t5142>Something of the old beautiful blue remained in the watery, drunken eyes, and the noble curve of the pencil-drawn nose and shapely neck had not yet entirely vanished.</t5142> <t5143>Yes, it was Dorian himself.</t5143> <t5144>But who had painted it?</t5144> <t5145>Hallward seemed to recognize his own brush strokes; the design of the frame was also his.</t5145> <t5146>It was impossible, yet the painter, seized by fear, took the candle and raised it towards the painting.</t5146> <t5147>In the bottom left corner, his own name was written in long, bright red letters.</t5147>
<t5148>This must have been a disgusting imitation, a vile, treacherous mockery.</t5148> <t5149>The person who made this painting was never him.</t5149> <t5150>Yet the painting was the one he had made.</t5150> <t5151>Hallward had recognized it, and it was as if the blood in his veins had suddenly turned from fire to ice.</t5151> <t5152>His own painting, huh!</t5152> <t5153>What did this mean?</t5153> <t5154>Why had this painting undergone such a transformation!</t5154> <t5155>Hallward turned and looked at Dorian with the eyes of a feverish patient.</t5155> <t5156>His mouth was twitching, his dry tongue seemed incapable of turning to speak.</t5156> <t5157>He ran his hand across his forehead.</t5157> <t5158>His skin was wet with sweat, sticky.</t5158>
<t5159>Dorian Gray was leaning against the frame of the fireplace, watching him; on his face was that strange expression seen on the faces of those watching a great artist perform on stage.</t5159> <t5160>It was neither genuine sorrow nor genuine joy.</t5160> <t5161>Only the passion of watching, and perhaps a spark of triumph in his eyes.</t5161> <t5162>Dorian had removed the flower from his coat collar and was either smelling it or pretending to do so.</t5162>
<t5163>Finally, Hallward shouted softly, "What does this mean?"</t5163> <t5164>His own voice sounded shrill and strange to his ears.</t5164>
<t5165>Dorian Gray, crushing the flower in his hand, said, "Years ago, when I was a young boy, we met."</t5165> <t5166>"You flattered me, taught me to take pride in my beauty.</t5166> <t5167>One day, you introduced me to a friend; he explained the miracle of youth to me, and the portrait you had completed revealed the miracle of beauty before my eyes.</t5167> <t5168>In a moment of madness...</t5168> <t5169>Though even now, I don't know if I regret it...</t5169> <t5170>I made a wish, or perhaps you could call it a plea...</t5170><t5171>"</t5171>
<t5172>“I remember!</t5172> <t5173>I remember so clearly!</t5173> <t5174>But no, this can't be happening.</t5174> <t5175>The room must be damp, the canvas covered in mold.</t5175> <t5176>Was there some damn mineral poison in the paints I used!</t5176> <t5177>It's impossible, I'm telling you.</t5177><t5178>”</t5178>
<t5179>Dorian murmured, "Is there anything that won't happen?" as he walked to the window and pressed his forehead against the fogged-up glass.</t5179>
<t5180>“You said you had removed the picture.</t5180><t5181>”</t5181>
<t5182>“I lied.</t5182> <t5183>It destroyed me.</t5183><t5184>”</t5184>
<t5185>“This is the painting I made, huh...</t5185> <t5186>I can't believe it.</t5186><t5187>”</t5187>
<t5188>"Can't you see your ideal in the painting?" Dorian asked bitterly.</t5188>
<t5189>“My ideal, as you said...</t5189><t5190>”</t5190>
<t5191>“Not as I say, but as you say.</t5191><t5192>”</t5192>
<t5193>“No evil, no sin had touched her, there was nothing to be ashamed of.</t5193> <t5194>You were such an ideal in my eyes that I will never find again.</t5194> <t5195>Yet this is the face of a demon.</t5195><t5196>”</t5196>
<t5197>“This is the face of my soul.</t5197><t5198>”</t5198>
<t5199>"Oh Great God! Have I worshipped something like this!</t5199> <t5200>Its eyes are the eyes of the devil.</t5200><t5201>"</t5201>
<t5202>Opening his arms with wild abandon, Dorian said, "Each of us carries both Heaven and Hell within us, Basil."</t5202>
<t5203>Hallward turned towards the portrait and stared at it.</t5203> <t5204>"Good God, if what you say is true, if you have lived your life in this way...</t5204> <t5205>You are worse than what your detractors think!" He raised the light again and examined the portrait.</t5205> <t5206>The surface of the canvas was as he had left it, untouched.</t5206> <t5207>It was as if the hideousness, the horror, had been revealed from within.</t5207> <t5208>With a strange life festering from within, the leprous sores of sin were slowly gnawing at the face in the picture.</t5208> <t5209>Even the decay of a corpse in a damp grave could not be so horrifying.</t5209>
<t5210>Hallward's hands began to tremble; the candle on the candelabrum fell to the ground and started to sizzle there.</t5210> <t5211>The painter stepped on the candle with his foot and extinguished it.</t5211> <t5212>Then, dropping himself into the wobbling chair by the table, he buried his face in his hands.</t5212>
<t5213>“My God, Dorian, what a lesson this is!</t5213> <t5214>What a tremendous lesson!</t5214><t5215>”</t5215>
<t5216>There was no response, but the painter could hear Dorian sobbing by the window.</t5216>
<t5217>“Pray, Dorian, pray,” he murmured.</t5217> <t5218>“There was a prayer they taught us in our childhood; how did it go?</t5218> <t5219>Lead us not into temptation.</t5219> <t5220>Forgive us our sins.</t5220> <t5221>Wash away the stain of our wickedness.</t5221> <t5222>Come, let’s recite it together.</t5222> <t5223>Your plea of pride has been answered.</t5223> <t5224>Your plea of remorse will also be answered.</t5224> <t5225>I had exalted you too much.</t5225> <t5226>Now I am seeing the punishment for it.</t5226> <t5227>You also exalted yourself too much.</t5227> <t5228>We are both being punished.</t5228><t5229>”</t5229>
<t5230>Dorian Gray turned slowly and looked at the painter with eyes dimmed by tears.</t5230>
<t5231>“It's too late now, Basil,” he stammered.</t5231> <t5232>“The deed is done.</t5232><t5233>”</t5233>
<t5234>“It is never too late, Dorian.</t5234> <t5235>Come, let us kneel here; let's see if we can think of a prayer.</t5235> <t5236>Wasn't there a prayer that went something like: Even if your sins are scarlet, I can make them white as snow?</t5236><t5237>”</t5237>
<t5238>“These words mean nothing to me anymore.</t5238><t5239>”</t5239>
<t5240>"Shh, don't talk like that.</t5240> <t5241>Your sins are enough.</t5241> <t5242>Oh my God! Can't you see, how that damned thing is staring at us and grinning?</t5242><t5243>"</t5243>
<t5244>Dorian Gray glanced at the painting.</t5244> <t5245>A sudden, uncontrollable hatred towards Basil Hallward filled his heart.</t5245> <t5246>It was as if the image on the canvas had instilled this in him, those grinning lips had whispered it into his ear.</t5246> <t5247>Inside him, the wild emotions of an animal being hunted tingled, and Dorian felt a hatred towards the man at the table that he had never felt towards anything in his life.</t5247> <t5248>He looked around with mad eyes.</t5248> <t5249>Something was gleaming on the chest with the pictures in front of him.</t5249> <t5250>Dorian's eyes fixed on it.</t5250> <t5251>He knew what it was.</t5251> <t5252>A knife he had brought a few days ago to cut a rope, and then forgotten to take downstairs.</t5252> <t5253>Dorian slowly walked towards the chest, passing by Hallward.</t5253> <t5254>As soon as he got behind Hallward, he turned, taking the knife in his hand.</t5254>
<t5255>Hallward had stirred as if to get up.</t5255> <t5256>Dorian leapt upon him, drove the knife into the thick vein behind his ear, and pressing his head down onto the table, struck him again and again with the knife.</t5256>
<t5257>A muffled moan was heard, then the terrifying sound made by a person suffocating and choking on their own blood.</t5257> <t5258>The painter's outstretched arms flailed in the air three times, his clawing fingers scratching at the air.</t5258> <t5259>Dorian stabbed him twice more, but the man was no longer moving.</t5259> <t5260>Something began to drip onto the floor.</t5260> <t5261>Dorian still held the man's head down on the table for a while.</t5261> <t5262>Then he threw the knife onto the table and listened intently.</t5262>
<t5263>He heard nothing but the patter of drops falling on the shabby carpet.</t5263> <t5264>He opened the door and stepped out onto the landing.</t5264> <t5265>There was no sound, no movement of feet inside the house.</t5265> <t5266>Dorian leaned over the railing and looked down into the seething dark pit below.</t5266> <t5267>Then he took out his key, re-entered the room, and locked the door from the inside.</t5267>
<t5268>That thing was still sitting on the chair, leaning on the table, with its bent head, hunched back, and incredibly long arms.</t5268> <t5269>If it weren't for the bright red tear on its neck and the growing pool of clotted black on the table, you might have thought the man had fallen asleep.</t5269>
<t5270>How quickly everything had happened!</t5270> <t5271>Dorian was in a strange state of calmness.</t5271> <t5272>He went, opened the balcony door, and stepped out onto the balcony.</t5272> <t5273>The wind had dispersed the mist, and the sky resembled a giant peacock tail dotted with countless golden eyes.</t5273> <t5274>When Dorian looked down, he saw the patrolling policeman passing by, shining the long beam of his lantern on the doors of the silent houses.</t5274> <t5275>The red light of a silently and seemingly stealthily advancing carriage glimmered at a corner, then disappeared.</t5275> <t5276>A woman, with her shawl fluttering in the wind, was moving along the railing with unsteady steps, almost crawling.</t5276> <t5277>Every now and then, she would stop and look back over her shoulder.</t5277> <t5278>Once, she started singing a song in a hoarse, rough voice.</t5278> <t5279>The policeman came and said something to her.</t5279> <t5280>The woman laughed and staggered away.</t5280> <t5281>A sharp gust of wind swept across the square.</t5281> <t5282>The flames of the gas lamps flickered and turned a deep blue, and the bare trees waved their pitch-black, iron-like branches.</t5282> <t5283>Dorian shivered, went back inside, and closed the door.</t5283>
<t5284>He walked, turned the key, and opened the room door.</t5284> <t5285>He didn't even look at the man he had killed.</t5285> <t5286>He felt that the key to this situation was not becoming aware of the events.</t5286> <t5287>The friend who had drawn that cursed portrait, the source of all his suffering, had left his life.</t5287> <t5288>This was enough.</t5288>
<t5289>Suddenly, he thought of the lamp.</t5289> <t5290>It was a Moorish piece, something unusual: made of dull silver covered with bright steel arabesques, inlaid with turquoise roots.</t5290> <t5291>His servant might notice the absence of the lamp, which could lead to questions being asked.</t5291> <t5292>Dorian hesitated a bit, then turned and took the lamp from the table.</t5292> <t5293>His eyes involuntarily fell on the dead thing.</t5293> <t5294>How motionless it was!</t5294> <t5295>How dreadful was the whiteness of those long hands!</t5295> <t5296>It looked like a terrible sculpture made of wax.</t5296>
<t5297>Dorian locked the door behind him and quietly descended to the lower floor.</t5297> <t5298>The floorboards creaked, as if they were screaming in pain.</t5298> <t5299>Dorian stopped and waited several times.</t5299> <t5300>But no, there was neither a sound nor a movement.</t5300> <t5301>The only thing he heard was the sound of his own footsteps.</t5301>
<t5302>When he reached the bookshelf, he saw the bag and coat standing in the corner.</t5302> <t5303>These needed to be hidden somewhere.</t5303> <t5304>Dorian opened a secret compartment behind the wall paneling.</t5304> <t5305>He placed the bag and coat in this compartment where he stored various, interesting clothes he used when he wanted to disguise himself.</t5305> <t5306>It was no big deal to burn them later.</t5306> <t5307>Dorian looked at his pocket watch and saw that it was twenty to two.</t5307>
<t5308>Dorian sat down and began to think.</t5308> <t5309>In England, every year, almost every month, people were being hanged because of what he had done.</t5309> <t5310>A madness of murder was in the air.</t5310> <t5311>Had a red star come too close to our world or what...</t5311> <t5312>On the other hand, what evidence was there to incriminate him?</t5312> <t5313>Basil Hallward had left his house at eleven o'clock.</t5313> <t5314>No one had seen him come a second time.</t5314> <t5315>Most of the servants were at the Selby Royal estate in the countryside.</t5315> <t5316>His personal valet had gone to bed and fallen asleep...</t5316> <t5317>Paris! Yes, yes.</t5317> <t5318>Basil had gone to Paris, after all, by the midnight train, as planned.</t5318> <t5319>Being a reserved person, it would take months for his absence to arouse suspicion.</t5319> <t5320>Months! By then, everything would have been disposed of.</t5320>
<t5321>Suddenly, something occurred to Dorian.</t5321> <t5322>The young man put on his fur coat and hat and stepped into the hall.</t5322> <t5323>Here, he paused to listen to the heavy, slow footsteps of the watchman echoing on the pavement and saw the reflection of the lantern light on the windows.</t5323> <t5324>He waited, barely daring to breathe.</t5324>
<t5325>A few minutes later, he unlocked the bolt, stepped outside, and gently closed the door behind him.</t5325> <t5326>Then he started ringing the bell.</t5326> <t5327>Within five minutes, his servant appeared at the threshold, half-dressed, with sleep streaming from his eyes.</t5327>
<t5328>Dorian said, "I'm sorry, Francis, I had to wake you up."</t5328> <t5329>"I forgot my key.</t5329> <t5330>What time is it, dear?</t5330><t5331>"</t5331>
<t5332>Adam, blinking his eyes as he looked at the clock, said, "It's ten past two, sir."</t5332>
<t5333>“Is it ten past two?</t5333> <t5334>It's quite late!</t5334> <t5335>You'll wake me up at nine tomorrow.</t5335> <t5336>I have things to do.</t5336><t5337>”</t5337>
<t5338>"At your service, sir."</t5338><t5339></t5339>
<t5340>“Did anyone call or ask about me in the evening?</t5340><t5341>”</t5341>
<t5342>"Mr. Hallward, sir."</t5342> <t5343>"He waited until eleven o'clock, then he left; he had to catch a train."</t5343><t5344>"</t5344>
<t5345>“Oh! I'm really sorry I missed him.</t5345> <t5346>Did he leave any message or something?</t5346><t5347>”</t5347>
<t5348>“No, sir.</t5348> <t5349>He only said that if he couldn't find you at your club, he would write a letter from Paris.</t5349><t5350>”</t5350>
<t5351>“Well, Francis, thank you.</t5351> <t5352>Don't forget to wake me up at nine tomorrow morning.</t5352><t5353>”</t5353>
<t5354>“I won't forget, sir.</t5354><t5355>”</t5355>
<t5356>Adam shuffled down the corridor in his slippers.</t5356>
<t5357>Dorian Gray placed his coat and hat on the table and went to the bookshelf.</t5357> <t5358>For a quarter of an hour, he wandered around the room, biting his lip and racking his brain.</t5358> <t5359>Then he took down the Blue Book that was on one of the shelves and started flipping through the pages.</t5359> <t5360>“Alan Campbell, No.</t5360> <t5361>152, Hetford Street, Mayfair.” Yes, this was the man he was looking for.</t5361>
<t5362>Chapter Fourteen</t5362>
<t5363>The next morning at nine o'clock, Dorian's servant entered the room with a tray holding a glass of cocoa and opened the shutters.</t5363> <t5364>Dorian was lying on his right side, one hand under his cheek, sleeping comfortably.</t5364> <t5365>He resembled a child tired from playing games or studying.</t5365>
<t5366>Adam had to shake his shoulder twice to wake him up.</t5366> <t5367>As Dorian woke up, a slight smile trembled on his lips as if he were in a sweet dream.</t5367> <t5368>Yet he had not dreamed at all, no sweet or bitter image had disturbed his night.</t5368> <t5369>However, youth smiles for no reason.</t5369> <t5370>This is one of its most charming aspects.</t5370>
<t5371>Dorian turned and began sipping his cocoa while leaning on his elbow.</t5371> <t5372>The soft November light was pouring into the room.</t5372> <t5373>The sky was sparkling, and there was a friendly warmth in the air.</t5373> <t5374>Almost like a May morning.</t5374>
<t5375>Over time, the events of the night, blood-stained and with silent steps, walked into his brain, where they coalesced and took shape with a terrible clarity.</t5375> <t5376>Dorian shuddered as he recalled all that he had endured.</t5376> <t5377>For a moment, that strange hatred that had led him to kill Basil Hallward as he sat in the chair enveloped him again, and Dorian froze with a vengeful fury.</t5377> <t5378>The dead man was still sitting in that chair; the sunlight must have been shining on him by now.</t5378> <t5379>What a dreadful thing this was!</t5379> <t5380>Such hideous ugliness belonged to the night, not to the daylight.</t5380>
<t5381>It seemed to Dorian that if he let the torments of last night replay in his mind, he would either fall ill or go mad.</t5381> <t5382>There were sins whose allure lay not in their commission but in their recollection: strange victories that flattered one's pride more than they dulled the fire of emotions, giving a surge of pride to the mind that was far greater and more vivid than the pleasure they gave to the senses.</t5382> <t5383>However, this event was not one of those sins.</t5383> <t5384>It was something that needed to be banished from the mind, numbed with opium.</t5384> <t5385>It had to be drowned, or else it could drown the man.</t5385>
<t5386>When the clock struck half-past seven, Dorian quickly got up, passing his hand over his forehead, carefully selected his tie and tie pin, and dressed more meticulously than usual, changing his rings several times.</t5386> <t5387>He lingered at the breakfast table for a long time, tasting the various foods on the table, talked with his servant about the new uniforms he planned to have made for the servants at Selby, and reviewed the letters that had arrived in the mail.</t5387> <t5388>Some of the letters made him smile.</t5388> <t5389>Three of them gave him a sense of unease.</t5389> <t5390>One of them, after reading it from start to finish many times, he tore up with a slight anger on his face.</t5390> <t5391>As Lord Henry once said:</t5391>
<t5392>“That dreadful thing called women's memory!</t5392><t5393>”</t5393>
<t5394>After drinking his plain coffee from the cup, Dorian wiped his lips with a napkin, signaled his servant to wait, and went to the desk to write two letters.</t5394> <t5395>He put one of them in his pocket and handed the other to his servant.</t5395>
<t5396>"Francis, take this to 152 Hertford Street.</t5396> <t5397>If Mr. Campbell is out of town, get his address.</t5397><t5398>"</t5398>
<t5399>As soon as Dorian was alone, he lit a cigarette and started sketching something on a piece of paper.</t5399> <t5400>At first, he drew pictures of flowers, then human faces.</t5400> <t5401>Suddenly, he noticed that every face he drew bore a striking resemblance to Basil Hallward's face.</t5401> <t5402>Frowning, he got up and went to the bookshelf, picking a book at random.</t5402> <t5403>He was determined not to think about the night's event until it became unavoidable.</t5403>
<t5404>When he lay down on the couch, he looked at the title of the book in his hand.</t5404> <t5405>It was Gautier's Émaux et Camées, the Charpentier edition adorned with Jacquemart engravings on Japanese paper.</t5405> <t5406>The binding was of lemon-green morocco, with gilt latticework and speckled pomegranate designs.</t5406> <t5407>Adrian Singleton had given him this book.</t5407> <t5408>As Dorian turned the pages, his eye caught a poem about Lacenaire's hand: that cold yellow hand with fine red hairs and fingers "like those of a forest god": "du supplice encore mal lavée" –still unwashed from the torture–.</t5408> <t5409>Dorian looked at his own long-fingered, snow-white hands and involuntarily shuddered slightly as he turned the page.</t5409> <t5410>A little later, he found those beautiful quatrains written about Venice:</t5410>
<t5411>"In the carnival of ever-changing colors"</t5411>
<t5412>Their chests shimmering with pearls</t5412>
<t5413>Venus of the Adriatic Sea</t5413>
<t5414>She emerges from the waters with her pink and white body.</t5414>
<t5415>The domes reflect in the blue of the waters,</t5415>
<t5416>By watching a pure feeling.</t5416>
<t5417>Rising with a sigh of love</t5417>
<t5418>Swell like round breasts</t5418>
<t5419>Tying the mooring line to a post</t5419>
<t5420>The boat left me on the shore,</t5420>
<t5421>On the marble steps</t5421>
<t5422>The facade of a pink building.</t5422><t5423>”</t5423>
<t5424>How exquisite were these verses!</t5424> <t5425>While reading these lines, one felt as if they were gliding through the green water roads of that pink and pearly city in a black gondola with silver prow and fluttering curtains.</t5425> <t5426>The mere form of these lines evoked for Dorian the turquoise blue, straight lines followed when going to Lido.</t5426> <t5427>The sudden flashes of color reminded him of those iridescent purple-necked birds flapping around the high, honeycombed Campanile and walking with dignified harmony under the dusty, dim arches.</t5427> <t5428>Dorian half-closed his eyes and leaned back, saying to himself,</t5428>
<t5429>On the marble steps</t5429>
<t5430>The facade of a pink building...</t5430>
<t5431>He started repeating the lines over and over again.</t5431>
<t5432>All of Venice was in these two lines.</t5432> <t5433>Dorian remembered the autumn season he spent there, that marvelous love that incited him to magnificent follies.</t5433> <t5434>Everywhere was filled with romance.</t5434> <t5435>Venice, like Oxford, had managed to preserve its romantic decor, which meant everything, or almost everything, to true romantics.</t5435> <t5436>Basil had also stayed with him for a while, becoming madly infatuated with Tintoretto.</t5436> <t5437>Poor Basil! What a terrible death he had met.</t5437>
<t5438>Dorian sighed deeply and picked up the book again, trying to forget everything.</t5438> <t5439>He read the lines describing the small café in Izmir: the swallows flitting in and out of the windows, the pilgrims sitting and pulling their amber rosaries, the turbaned merchants having solemn conversations while puffing on their long, tasseled pipes.</t5439> <t5440>He read the poem describing the obelisk at Place de la Concorde in Paris: In its sunless exile, utterly alone, shedding granite tears and longing to be on the warm banks of the Nile covered with water lilies, among the sphinxes, rose-red ibises, white hawks with gilded talons, and the small jade-eyed crocodiles crawling through the steaming mud.</t5440> <t5441>The verses describing that strange sculpture, which Gautier likened to a deep, resonant voice, the monstre charmant crouching in ambush in the porphyry room of the Louvre, and distilling poetry from marble covered in lip marks, enveloped Dorian's mind.</t5441>
<t5442>But after a while, the book fell from his hand.</t5442> <t5443>He was filled with dread, then he was seized by a terrible fear.</t5443> <t5444>What if Alan Campbell was out of the country?</t5444> <t5445>Days would pass until he returned.</t5445> <t5446>Perhaps he would refuse to come to Dorian.</t5446> <t5447>What would Dorian do then?</t5447> <t5448>Every passing minute carried vital importance.</t5448> <t5449>Once, five years ago, they were very close friends.</t5449> <t5450>Alan Campbell and he were inseparable.</t5450> <t5451>Then, this closeness suddenly came to an end.</t5451> <t5452>Now, when they met in public, only Dorian Gray would smile and greet him.</t5452> <t5453>Alan Campbell never responded to these greetings.</t5453>
<t5454>Although he didn't really understand visual arts, he had barely learned to appreciate the beauty of poetry from Dorian, but he was an extremely intelligent young man.</t5454> <t5455>His main intellectual passion was the natural sciences.</t5455> <t5456>While at Cambridge, he spent most of his time working in the laboratory.</t5456> <t5457>In his final year, he had also achieved a good grade in the honors exams for natural sciences.</t5457> <t5458>He was still interested in chemistry studies, and he even had a private laboratory.</t5458> <t5459>By shutting himself in there from morning till night, he would get on the nerves of his mother, who thought chemists were just people who filled prescriptions and was fixated on him entering Parliament.</t5459> <t5460>On the other hand, he was an excellent musician; he played both the violin and the piano much better than most amateurs.</t5460>
<t5461>In fact, it was music that brought him together with Dorian Gray; music, and that indescribable attraction Dorian often (unconsciously) evoked whenever he wished.</t5461> <t5462>They had met at Lady Berkshire's, on the night Rubinstein played the piano there.</t5462> <t5463>Later, they were often seen together at the opera, and everywhere quality music was played.</t5463> <t5464>This closeness lasted for eighteen months.</t5464> <t5465>Campbell had practically moved into the house on Grosvenor Square from Selby Royal.</t5465> <t5466>Like many others, to him, Dorian Gray was the symbol of everything magnificent and enchanting in the world.</t5466> <t5467>It was never known whether they had a quarrel.</t5467> <t5468>However, it soon became noticeable that they hardly spoke when they met.</t5468> <t5469>Campbell began to leave gatherings where Dorian Gray was present, early.</t5469> <t5470>Campbell had changed a lot; he seemed to fall into a strange lethargy, as if he no longer enjoyed listening to music; he no longer played the piano, and when asked to play, he would excuse himself by saying that he was too engrossed in his scientific pursuits to have time for music practice, which was indeed true.</t5470> <t5471>The young man's interest in biology seemed to grow with each passing day.</t5471> <t5472>His name had appeared several times in some scientific journals in connection with strange experiments.</t5472>
<t5473>This was the man Dorian Gray had been waiting for.</t5473> <t5474>Dorian kept looking at the clock on the wall every moment, and as the minutes passed, the ugly, anxious excitement inside him grew.</t5474> <t5475>Finally, he got up and began pacing the room: He was like a beautiful creature trapped in a cage.</t5475> <t5476>He walked with long, stealthy steps.</t5476> <t5477>His hands were ice-cold, for some reason.</t5477>
<t5478>The tension of his waiting was at unbearable levels.</t5478> <t5479>It seemed to Dorian that while he was being swept towards jagged rocks at the mouth of a pitch-black abyss by tremendous winds, time was crawling with leaden feet.</t5479> <t5480>Dorian knew what awaited him in that abyss; he didn't just know, he saw it, and he shuddered from head to toe, pressing his burning eyelids with his damp hands, wanting to crush the vision in his brain, to push his eyes back into their sockets.</t5480> <t5481>But it wasn't working.</t5481> <t5482>The brain was finding nourishment on its own to feed itself.</t5482> <t5483>Imagination, driven mad by horror, was writhing and struggling like a living creature in pain, playing like a disgusting puppet on a string, grinning from beneath shifting masks.</t5483>
<t5484>Then, suddenly, time stopped for Dorian Gray.</t5484> <t5485>Yes, that heavy-breathing, blind-eyed thing was no longer moving.</t5485> <t5486>Now that time had died, chilling thoughts raced ahead, unearthing a hideous, horrifying future and showing it to Dorian.</t5486> <t5487>Dorian stood transfixed by it.</t5487> <t5488>He was petrified by the horror of what he saw.</t5488>
<t5489>Finally, the door opened, and the servant entered.</t5489> <t5490>Dorian turned his glazed eyes to him.</t5490>
<t5491>"Mr. Campbell, sir," said the man.</t5491>
<t5492>A relieved breath escaped from Dorian's parched lips, and the color returned to his face.</t5492>
<t5493>"Please come in, Francis."</t5493> <t5494>Dorian had composed himself by now.</t5494> <t5495>The earlier cowardice had passed.</t5495>
<t5496>The servant bowed and withdrew.</t5496> <t5497>A few minutes later, Campbell entered.</t5497> <t5498>His face was very stern, a bit pale, and the coal-black of his hair and eyebrows seemed to accentuate the pallor of his complexion.</t5498>
<t5499>“Alan! You are very good.</t5499> <t5500>Thank you for coming, much appreciated.</t5500><t5501>”</t5501>
<t5502>“I was determined never to set foot in your house again, Gray.</t5502> <t5503>But you wrote that this is a matter of life and death.”</t5503> <t5504>The young man's voice was firm and cold.</t5504> <t5505>He spoke slowly and deliberately.</t5505> <t5506>There was a hint of disdain in the sharp look he directed at Dorian.</t5506> <t5507>He hadn't taken his hands out of the pockets of his astrakhan coat and had ignored Dorian's gesture of greeting.</t5507>
<t5508>“Yes, it's a matter of life and death, Alan, and not just for one single person.</t5508> <t5509>Have a seat, dear.</t5509><t5510>”</t5510>
<t5511>Campbell sat down on a chair at the desk.</t5511> <t5512>Dorian stood across from him.</t5512> <t5513>Their gazes met.</t5513> <t5514>There was infinite pity in Dorian's eyes.</t5514> <t5515>He knew the task he was about to do was dreadful.</t5515>
<t5516>After a short, tense silence, he leaned towards his guest, calmly, yet observing the effect of each of his words on the face opposite him, and said, "Alan."</t5516> <t5517>"In a locked room on the top floor of this house, there is a dead man sitting at a desk.</t5517> <t5518>No one but me can enter or leave the room.</t5518> <t5519>The man has been dead for ten hours.</t5519> <t5520>Don't fidget, and don't look at me like that.</t5520> <t5521>Who this man is, how he died, why he died...</t5521> <t5522>These are matters that do not concern you.</t5522> <t5523>Now, the only thing you need to do is...</t5523><t5524>"</t5524>
<t5525>“Enough, Gray.</t5525> <t5526>I don't want to know anything else.</t5526> <t5527>I don't care whether what you told me is true or not.</t5527> <t5528>I refuse to interfere in your life.</t5528> <t5529>Keep your dirty secrets to yourself.</t5529> <t5530>These things don't concern me in the slightest anymore.</t5530><t5531>”</t5531>
<t5532>“It will inevitably concern you, Alan.</t5532> <t5533>This secret, helplessly, will concern you.</t5533> <t5534>I pity you a lot, very much, my friend, but I have no other way out.</t5534> <t5535>You are the only person who can save me.</t5535> <t5536>I have to involve you in this matter.</t5536> <t5537>I have no other option.</t5537> <t5538>You are a scientist, Alan.</t5538> <t5539>You understand chemistry and such.</t5539> <t5540>You have conducted experiments.</t5540> <t5541>Now, what you need to do is to get rid of that thing upstairs, leaving no trace behind.</t5541> <t5542>No one saw anyone enter this house.</t5542> <t5543>It will be months before anyone notices its absence.</t5543> <t5544>When they do notice, there should be no trace of it in this house.</t5544> <t5545>You, Alan, yes, you must turn the man and everything belonging to him into a handful of ashes that I can scatter into the air.</t5545><t5546>”</t5546>
<t5547>“You have gone mad, Dorian.</t5547><t5548>”</t5548>
<t5549>“Ah! I was expecting you to call me, Dorian.</t5549><t5550>”</t5550>
<t5551>“You are insane, I'm telling you.</t5551> <t5552>You think I would even lift a finger to help you...</t5552> <t5553>Confessing this horrible thing to me, it's all madness.</t5553> <t5554>No matter what this is about, I'm not getting involved.</t5554> <t5555>Do you think I would risk tarnishing my name for your sake?</t5555> <t5556>Why should I care about whatever devilish scheme you've gotten yourself into this time?</t5556><t5557>”</t5557>
<t5558>“It was suicide, Alan.</t5558><t5559>”</t5559>
<t5560>“Well, I'm glad about that.</t5560> <t5561>But what was the factor that drove the man to suicide?</t5561> <t5562>It was probably because of you.</t5562><t5563>”</t5563>
<t5564>“You still refuse to do this job for me, huh?</t5564><t5565>”</t5565>
<t5566>“Of course I refuse.</t5566> <t5567>I will not get involved in this matter in any way.</t5567> <t5568>So, even if you become disgraced, it doesn't matter to me.</t5568> <t5569>You deserve every kind of disgrace.</t5569> <t5570>Even if I see you being humiliated in front of everyone, I wouldn't feel sorry.</t5570> <t5571>As if there were no other men left in the world, how can you ask me to get involved in such a terrible thing with what face?</t5571> <t5572>I thought you understood human character better.</t5572> <t5573>I don't know what else your friend Lord Henry Wotton has taught you, but he must not have taught you much in the field of psychology.</t5573> <t5574>No pressure in the world can make me help you.</t5574> <t5575>You chose the wrong man.</t5575> <t5576>Go to one of your friends.</t5576> <t5577>Don't come to me.</t5577><t5578>”</t5578>
<t5579>“Alan, this is murder.</t5579> <t5580>I killed him.</t5580> <t5581>You have no idea what he put me through!</t5581> <t5582>No matter what kind of life I lived, this man's influence in causing destruction was far greater than poor Harry's.</t5582> <t5583>Maybe he didn't do it intentionally, but the result doesn't change!</t5583><t5584>”</t5584>
<t5585>“Murder, oh my God! Did you finally come to this, Dorian?</t5585> <t5586>I won't turn you in.</t5586> <t5587>It doesn't concern me.</t5587> <t5588>Even if I don't investigate, you'll get caught sooner or later.</t5588> <t5589>Criminals always make a mistake.</t5589> <t5590>But I won't get involved in this.</t5590><t5591>”</t5591>
<t5592>“Even if you don't want to, you'll get involved, Alan.</t5592> <t5593>Wait, hold on a minute, listen to me.</t5593> <t5594>Just listen, Alan.</t5594> <t5595>All I want from you is to conduct a scientific experiment.</t5595> <t5596>You go to hospitals, morgues, and such places, and the disgusting things you do there don't shake you.</t5596> <t5597>If you saw this man in a creepy autopsy room, in a laboratory reeking of stench...</t5597> <t5598>If you found him on a lead table with grooves for the blood to flow, you would see it as an interesting subject for examination.</t5598> <t5599>You wouldn't even flinch.</t5599> <t5600>You wouldn't think what you were doing was a bad thing.</t5600> <t5601>On the contrary, you would think you were working for the benefit of humanity, contributing to the world's knowledge, satisfying an intellectual curiosity, and such things.</t5601> <t5602>What I want from you is something you've done countless times before.</t5602> <t5603>In fact, disposing of a corpse should be much less horrifying than the things you usually do!</t5603> <t5604>And don't forget that this corpse is the only evidence that can be used against me.</t5604> <t5605>If it's found, it will be the day I'm ruined.</t5605> <t5606>And if you don't help me, it will definitely be found.</t5606><t5607>”</t5607>
<t5608>“I have absolutely no desire to help you.</t5608> <t5609>You forget this.</t5609> <t5610>The matter is completely irrelevant to me.</t5610> <t5611>It has nothing to do with me.</t5611><t5612>”</t5612>
<t5613>“Alan, I beg you.</t5613> <t5614>Think about my position in society.</t5614> <t5615>Just before you arrived, I was almost fainting from terror.</t5615> <t5616>One day, you might experience such terror yourself.</t5616> <t5617>No, don't think about that side of it.</t5617> <t5618>Look at the matter purely from a formal perspective.</t5618> <t5619>You don't ask where the dead things you experiment on come from.</t5619> <t5620>Don't ask questions now either.</t5620> <t5621>I've already given you too much information.</t5621> <t5622>I beg you to do this job.</t5622> <t5623>We were once friends, Alan.</t5623><t5624>”</t5624>
<t5625>“Don't remember those days, Dorian.</t5625> <t5626>They are dead.</t5626><t5627>”</t5627>
<t5628>“The dead sometimes linger among us, Alan.</t5628> <t5629>Look, the man upstairs isn't disappearing.</t5629> <t5630>His head is bowed, his arms are outstretched, he's sitting at the table.</t5630> <t5631>Alan! Alan, if you don't come to my rescue, I'm doomed.</t5631> <t5632>They'll hang me, Alan! Don't you understand?</t5632> <t5633>They'll string me up for what I've done.</t5633><t5634>”</t5634>
<t5635>“There is no point in prolonging this scene and leaving.</t5635> <t5636>I absolutely refuse to get involved in this matter.</t5636> <t5637>It's already madness to consult me.</t5637><t5638>”</t5638>
<t5639>“You are refusing, huh?</t5639><t5640>”</t5640>
<t5641>“Yes.</t5641><t5642>”</t5642>
<t5643>“I beg you, Alan.”</t5643><t5644>”</t5644>
<t5645>“In vain.</t5645><t5646>”</t5646>
<t5647>The same pained look appeared in Dorian Gray's eyes again.</t5647> <t5648>Then the young man reached out and took a sheet of paper.</t5648> <t5649>He wrote something.</t5649> <t5650>He read what he had written twice, carefully folded the paper, and pushed it towards his guest from across the table.</t5650> <t5651>Then he stood up and went to the window.</t5651>
<t5652>Campbell was staring at him in amazement.</t5652> <t5653>He took the paper and opened it.</t5653> <t5654>As he read, his face turned as pale as a dead man's and he leaned back.</t5654> <t5655>A terrible faintness enveloped him, and his heart was pounding as if it would burst in the void.</t5655>
<t5656>After a few minutes filled with a dreadful silence, Dorian turned, came to stand beside his guest, and placed his hand on his shoulder.</t5656>
<t5657>“I pity you, but you leave me no other choice, Alan,” she said.</t5657> <t5658>“I wrote and prepared the letter.</t5658> <t5659>Here, look.</t5659> <t5660>You see the address too.</t5660> <t5661>If you don't help me, I have no other way but to send this.</t5661> <t5662>If you don't help me, I will really send this.</t5662> <t5663>You know what the outcome will be.</t5663> <t5664>But you will help me.</t5664> <t5665>There's no way to say no anymore.</t5665> <t5666>I tried to protect you.</t5666> <t5667>If you don't admit this, you will be unfair to me.</t5667> <t5668>You acted harshly, treated me cruelly, insulted me.</t5668> <t5669>No one has ever dared to treat me like this, Alan.</t5669> <t5670>I mean no one alive, at least.</t5670> <t5671>I endured it all.</t5671> <t5672>Now it's my turn to set conditions.</t5672><t5673>”</t5673>
<t5674>Campbell buried his face in his hands and shivered from head to toe.</t5674>
<t5675>“Yes, it's my turn to set the conditions, Alan.</t5675> <t5676>You know what they are.</t5676> <t5677>The issue is extremely simple.</t5677> <t5678>Come on, don't torment yourself unnecessarily.</t5678> <t5679>There is a job to be done.</t5679> <t5680>Accept it and do it.</t5680><t5681>”</t5681>
<t5682>Campbell groaned softly; his whole body was trembling.</t5682> <t5683>The ticking of the clock above the fireplace seemed to divide time into atoms of torture, each one more dreadful to endure than the last.</t5683> <t5684>An iron band encircled his forehead, tightening slowly; the disgrace he faced seemed as if it had already come to pass.</t5684> <t5685>The hand on his shoulder felt as heavy as a hand of lead.</t5685> <t5686>It was unbearable.</t5686> <t5687>It was crushing him.</t5687>
<t5688>“Come on, Alan, you need to make a decision right now.</t5688><t5689>”</t5689>
<t5690>Like a programmed machine, the young man said, "I can't," as if he thought words could change the situation.</t5690>
<t5691>“You will do it.</t5691> <t5692>You have no other choice.</t5692> <t5693>Don't dawdle.</t5693><t5694>”</t5694>
<t5695>Campbell paused for a moment.</t5695> <t5696>"Is there a fire in the room upstairs?</t5696><t5697>"</t5697>
<t5698>“Yes.</t5698> <t5699>There is an asbestos stove.</t5699><t5700>”</t5700>
<t5701>“I need to go home and get some things from the laboratory.</t5701><t5702>”</t5702>
<t5703>“No, Alan, you cannot leave here; write down what you want on a piece of paper.</t5703> <t5704>My servant will hop into a carriage, get everything, and bring it to you.</t5704><t5705>”</t5705>
<t5706>Campbell scribbled a few lines and wrote his assistant's name on the envelope.</t5706> <t5707>Dorian took the note and read it carefully.</t5707>
<t5708>Then he rang the bell; he instructed his servant, to whom he had given the list, to return as soon as possible with the requested items.</t5708>
<t5709>As the door closed, Campbell flinched in fright, then got up and went to the fireplace.</t5709> <t5710>He was trembling as if he had malaria.</t5710> <t5711>For about twenty minutes, neither of them spoke.</t5711> <t5712>There was a fly buzzing around the room.</t5712> <t5713>The ticking of the clock was like the strike of a hammer.</t5713>
<t5714>As one o'clock struck, Campbell turned and looked at Dorian, seeing that his eyes were filled with tears.</t5714> <t5715>Something about the purity and gentleness of that face seemed to have infuriated him.</t5715>
<t5716>“You are a despicable bastard!” he muttered.</t5716> <t5717>“You are a disgrace.</t5717><t5718>”</t5718>
<t5719>“Stop, Alan.</t5719> <t5720>You saved my life.</t5720><t5721>”</t5721>
<t5722>“Your life, huh? Oh my God! But what a life, huh! You went from filth to filth and finally ended up committing murder.</t5722> <t5723>If I am doing this thing, that is, the thing I am forced to do because of you, it is not because I am thinking of you.</t5723><t5724>”</t5724>
<t5725>Dorian sighed, "Ah, Alan."</t5725> <t5726>"I wish you could pity me even a thousandth as much as I pity you!" He turned and fixed his gaze on the garden.</t5726>
<t5727>Campbell did not respond.</t5727>
<t5728>Ten minutes later, there was a knock on the door, and the servant entered.</t5728> <t5729>In his hand, he had a large mahogany medicine chest, a coil of steel cable, a coil of platinum wire, and two rather oddly shaped iron vices.</t5729>
<t5730>"Shall I leave these here, sir?" the servant asked Campbell.</t5730>
<t5731>Dorian replied, "Yes."</t5731> <t5732>"Ah, Francis, I'm afraid I have one more task.</t5732> <t5733>What was the name of the man in Richmond who sent orchids to Selby?</t5733><t5734>"</t5734>
<t5735>"Certainly, sir.</t5735><t5736>"</t5736>
<t5737>“Indeed.</t5737> <t5738>Harden.</t5738> <t5739>Now you will immediately go to Richmond and see this Harden for yourself.</t5739> <t5740>Have him send twice the amount of orchids I ordered there; and as few white ones as possible.</t5740> <t5741>In fact, I don't want any white ones at all.</t5741> <t5742>The weather is very nice, Francis.</t5742> <t5743>Richmond is a very charming neighborhood, otherwise I wouldn't trouble you with this task.</t5743><t5744>”</t5744>
<t5745>"It's no trouble at all, sir.</t5745> <t5746>When should I return?</t5746><t5747>"</t5747>
<t5748>Dorian turned and looked at Campbell.</t5748> <t5749>In a calm, indifferent voice, he asked, "Alan, how long will your experiment take?"</t5749>
<t5750>The presence of a third person in the room seemed to give him extraordinary courage.</t5750>
<t5751>Campbell frowned and bit his lip.</t5751> <t5752>"About five hours.</t5752><t5753>"</t5753>
<t5754>"Then it would be fine if you could return around half-past seven, Francis.</t5754> <t5755>But wait: You can take out the clothes I'll be wearing; you can have the evening off.</t5755> <t5756>Since I won't be eating at home, I won't need you.</t5756><t5757>"</t5757>
<t5758>Adam said, "Thank you, sir," and went outside.</t5758>
<t5759>“Come on, Alan, we don't have a single minute to waste.</t5759> <t5760>This chest is really heavy!</t5760> <t5761>I'll carry it for you.</t5761> <t5762>You bring the other things.”</t5762> <t5763>Dorian was speaking quickly and authoritatively.</t5763> <t5764>It was as if Campbell had come under his command.</t5764> <t5765>They left the room together.</t5765>
<t5766>When they reached the landing of the upper floor, Dorian took out the key and inserted it into the lock.</t5766> <t5767>Then he stopped, a worried look appeared in his eyes.</t5767> <t5768>"Alan, I don't think I can go inside.</t5768><t5769>"</t5769>
<t5770>Campbell said coolly, "I think the weather is nice."</t5770> <t5771>"I don't need you.</t5771><t5772>"</t5772>
<t5773>Dorian slightly opened the door.</t5773> <t5774>At that moment, he saw the sneering face of his portrait in the daylight.</t5774> <t5775>At the bottom, the torn curtain lay on the floor.</t5775> <t5776>Dorian remembered for the first time that he hadn't covered the ominous painting last night.</t5776> <t5777>Just as he was about to move forward, he recoiled with a shudder.</t5777>
<t5778>What was that disgusting red stain shining on one of the hands, as if blood had seeped from the canvas?</t5778> <t5779>How horrible it was!</t5779> <t5780>For a moment, it seemed to Dorian even more horrible than that silent thing slumped over the table.</t5780> <t5781>Like the crooked, terrifying shadow cast on the stained carpet, it showed that the thing had not moved and was still there, where he had left it.</t5781>
<t5782>Dorian took a deep breath, opened the door a bit more, then turned his head and darted inside, half-closing his eyes.</t5782> <t5783>He was determined not to look at the dead body even once.</t5783> <t5784>He bent down, lifted the embroidered purple cloth, and threw it over the painting.</t5784>
<t5785>He hesitated there, afraid to look around; his eyes were fixed on the complicated things in front of him.</t5785> <t5786>He watched as Campbell brought in the heavy chest, clamps, and other tools he would use for the dreadful task.</t5786> <t5787>At that moment, he could hardly believe that they had even met Basil Hallward.</t5787> <t5788>If they had met, how had they found each other?</t5788>
<t5789>A harsh voice rising from behind said, "Leave me alone now."</t5789>
<t5790>Dorian turned and quickly went outside.</t5790> <t5791>He caught a glimpse of the dead body being pushed backward, and Campbell staring at that moist, glistening, pale yellow face.</t5791> <t5792>As he descended the stairs, he heard the key turning in the lock.</t5792>
<t5793>When Campbell returned to the library, it was already past seven o'clock.</t5793> <t5794>The young man was pale but extremely calm.</t5794> <t5795>"I did what you asked of me," he said.</t5795> <t5796>"Now it's goodbye.</t5796> <t5797>Let's never see each other again.</t5797><t5798>"</t5798>
<t5799>Dorian briefly said, "You saved me from ruin, Alan.</t5799> <t5800>I cannot forget this," he said.</t5800>
<t5801>As soon as Campbell left, Dorian went upstairs.</t5801> <t5802>There was a disgusting smell of acid in the room.</t5802> <t5803>But the thing that had been sitting at the desk earlier was nowhere to be seen.</t5803>
<t5804>Fifteenth chapter</t5804>
<t5805>That evening at half-past eight, dressed extremely elegantly with a large bouquet of Parma violets on his lapel, Dorian Gray was taken to Lady Narborough's drawing room by the servants who bowed respectfully before him.</t5805> <t5806>The veins in his temples throbbed with tension, and he was filled with a fervent excitement.</t5806> <t5807>But as he bowed to kiss the hostess's hand, his demeanor was as relaxed and courteous as ever.</t5807> <t5808>Perhaps when one has to play a role, they appear even more at ease than they are.</t5808> <t5809>Indeed, none of those who looked at Dorian Gray that night would have believed that he had experienced a tragedy so dreadful it could rival any tragedy of our age.</t5809> <t5810>Those well-shaped fingers could not have held a knife with the intent to sin, those smiling lips could not have cursed God and goodness.</t5810> <t5811>Even he was surprised by the calmness of his behavior.</t5811> <t5812>For a moment, he savored the intense pleasure of leading a double life with all its sharpness.</t5812>
<t5813>It was a small gathering that Lady Narborough had hastily organized.</t5813> <t5814>According to Lord Henry's description, the Lady, who still bore traces of an extraordinary ugliness, was a very intelligent woman.</t5814> <t5815>She had married one of the most tedious ambassadors of our country and had become a perfect wife.</t5815> <t5816>After burying her husband in a marble tomb, which she had designed herself, and marrying off her daughters to somewhat older but wealthy men, she now devoted herself to the pleasures of French novels, French cuisine, and –when she could find it–</t5816> <t5817>French wit.</t5817>
<t5818>Dorian was one of her favorites.</t5818> <t5819>Lady Narborough always used to tell the young man that she was grateful she hadn't met him in her youth.</t5819> <t5820>“I know, my dear, I would have fallen madly in love with you,” she would say.</t5820> <t5821>“I would have sacrificed everything for you.</t5821> <t5822>Fortunately, you weren't even a thought in your parents' minds back then.</t5822> <t5823>Actually, I never even tried to flirt with anyone.</t5823> <t5824>But that was Narborough's fault.</t5824> <t5825>He was so nearsighted!</t5825> <t5826>What's the fun in cheating on a husband who can't even see the tip of his own nose?</t5826><t5827>”</t5827>
<t5828>The guests that night were quite annoying.</t5828> <t5829>Lady Narborough shielded her face with an old fan and told Dorian: One of her married daughters had suddenly come to stay the night, and as if that wasn't enough, she had brought her husband along.</t5829> <t5830>Lady Narborough whispered, “My daughter was very rude, my dear.”</t5830> <t5831>“Although I go and stay with them every summer on my way back from Hamburg, an old woman like me needs to get some fresh air from time to time.</t5831> <t5832>And besides, believe me, I bring a bit of life to them.</t5832> <t5833>If you knew what kind of life they lead there, you'd be astonished.</t5833> <t5834>Simple, village life.</t5834> <t5835>They wake up early in the morning because they have a lot to do; they go to bed early in the evening because they have nothing to think about.</t5835> <t5836>There hasn't been a scandal in that area since the time of Queen Elizabeth, so they fall asleep where they sit after dinner.</t5836> <t5837>I won't sit you next to them.</t5837> <t5838>You will sit next to me and entertain me.</t5838><t5839>”</t5839>
<t5840>Dorian mumbled a polite compliment as he looked around.</t5840> <t5841>Yes, it was indeed a boring gathering.</t5841> <t5842>Dorian had never seen two of the people there.</t5842> <t5843>The others were: Ernest Harrowden, one of those middle-aged, stereotypical types often seen in London clubs, who, despite having no enemies, managed to earn the hatred of his friends.</t5843> <t5844>Lady Ruxton, a forty-seven-year-old, hook-nosed, overdressed woman who constantly tried to ruin her own reputation but was so utterly meaningless that she couldn't convince anyone of it, and was quite upset about that.</t5844> <t5845>Ms. Erlynne, with her Venetian red hair and sweet lisp, an ambitious, intrusive nobody.</t5845> <t5846>Lady Alice Chapman, the host's daughter.</t5846> <t5847>A drab, dowdy girl with a typical English face that one could never remember after seeing it once.</t5847> <t5848>And her husband, a red-cheeked, white-bearded creature who, like many of his class, believed he could compensate for his lack of intelligence with excessive cheerfulness.</t5848>
<t5849>Dorian had just begun to regret coming here when the hostess, looking at the large, gilded brass clock with its ostentatious curves on the lilac-colored cloth of the mantelpiece, said, "It's quite naughty of Henry Wotton to be this late!"</t5849> <t5850>"I sent word this morning, and he promised he wouldn't disappoint me.</t5850><t5851>"</t5851>
<t5852>Anyway, knowing that Henry would come was a consolation, at least.</t5852> <t5853>When the door opened a little later and he heard that slow, melodious voice of his that added sweetness to a feigned apology, all of Dorian Gray's anxiety vanished.</t5853>
<t5854>However, he couldn't eat anything at the meal.</t5854> <t5855>The plates placed in front of him were taken away untouched.</t5855> <t5856>Lady Narborough kept scolding him, saying, "You're humiliating poor Adolphe, who prepared this menu especially for you," while Lord Henry occasionally looked across, trying to understand his silence and distraction.</t5856> <t5857>Whenever the servant filled his glass with champagne, Dorian drank as if he were thirsty, and the more he drank, the thirstier he seemed to become.</t5857>
<t5858>In the end, as the chaud-froid9 was being served, Lord Henry said, "Dorian."</t5858> <t5859>"What's wrong with you tonight?</t5859> <t5860>You seem quite out of sorts.</t5860><t5861>"</t5861>
<t5862>Lady Narborough interrupted, "But Dorian is in love!"</t5862> <t5863>"However, he doesn't dare tell me for fear that I might be jealous.</t5863> <t5864>He's quite right to think so.</t5864> <t5865>I really would be jealous.</t5865><t5866>"</t5866>
<t5867>Dorian smiled and murmured, "Dear Lady Narborough,"</t5867> <t5868>"It has been a week since I have given my heart to anyone.</t5868> <t5869>That is, since Madam Ferrol left London.</t5869><t5870>"</t5870>
<t5871>The old lady shouted, "You men!"</t5871> <t5872>"How can you fall in love with that woman!</t5872> <t5873>I just don't understand.</t5873><t5874>"</t5874>
<t5875>Lord Henry, "He reminds you of your childhood, Lady Narborough," he said.</t5875> <t5876>"He is the only link between your short dresses and us.</t5876><t5877>"</t5877>
<t5878>“It doesn't remind me of my short dresses at all, Lord Henry.</t5878> <t5879>But I remember her very well from Vienna thirty years ago: how she used to walk around décolletée and all.</t5879><t5880>”</t5880>
<t5881>Lord Henry, taking an olive with his long fingers, replied, "She is now going around décolletée."</t5881> <t5882>"Even when she dresses very stylishly, she resembles a de luxe edition of a bad French novel.</t5882> <t5883>She is truly a marvelous woman, full of surprises.</t5883> <t5884>Especially her family affection is something unseen.</t5884> <t5885>When her third husband died, the poor woman's hair turned completely yellow from grief.</t5885><t5886>"</t5886>
<t5887>Dorian said, "Harry, shame on you!"</t5887>
<t5888>The hostess laughed, "A very romantic comparison."</t5888> <t5889>"But did you say her third husband, Lord Henry?</t5889> <t5890>Do you mean to say Ferrol is her fourth husband?</t5890><t5891>"</t5891>
<t5892>“Of course, madam.</t5892><t5893>”</t5893>
<t5894>“I don't believe a single word.</t5894><t5895>”</t5895>
<t5896>"Then ask Mr. Gray.</t5896> <t5897>He is one of that lady's closest friends.</t5897><t5898>"</t5898>
<t5899>“Are these true, Mr. Gray?</t5899><t5900>”</t5900>
<t5901>Dorian said, "He swears that it is so, sir."</t5901> <t5902>"I asked him: Did she, like Marguerite de Navarre, mummify their hearts and hang them on her belt?</t5902> <t5903>He said she did not, because they were all heartless.</t5903><t5904>"</t5904>
<t5905>“Four big ha! Wow, that's exactly trop de zèle –overzealousness– this is!</t5905><t5906>”</t5906>
<t5907>Dorian said, "Too much audacity –recklessness– I would say to him."</t5907>
<t5908>“Oh, he is certainly daring, my dear.</t5908> <t5909>What does this Ferrol look like, then?</t5909> <t5910>I don't know him at all.</t5910><t5911>”</t5911>
<t5912>Lord Henry, "Husbands of very beautiful women are considered to be in the class of heavy criminals," he said, taking a sip of his wine.</t5912>
<t5913>Lady Narborough struck him with her fan.</t5913> <t5914>"Lord Henry, I am not at all surprised that the whole world says you are an extremely bad, mischievous man.</t5914><t5915>"</t5915>
<t5916>Lord Henry raised his eyebrows, "Well, which world is that?"</t5916> <t5917>"It must be the other world.</t5917> <t5918>Because there is no gap between this world and me.</t5918><t5919>"</t5919>
<t5920>The elderly lady nodded her head and said, "Everyone I know says that you are very mischievous."</t5920>
<t5921>Lord Henry stood serious for a while.</t5921> <t5922>Finally, he said, "It's an outright scandal!"</t5922> <t5923>"These days, everyone spreads such rumors about a person that they are absolutely, one hundred percent true.</t5923><t5924>"</t5924>
<t5925>Dorian leaned forward and said, "This man won't come around, will he?"</t5925>
<t5926>The hostess laughed, "I hope so."</t5926> <t5927>"But I'm serious, if you all are so enamored with Madam Ferrol, it means I'll have to get married again to be in fashion."</t5927><t5928>"</t5928>
<t5929>Lord Henry, "You will never marry again, my lady," he said.</t5929> <t5930>"You are too happy to think about it.</t5930> <t5931>Women remarry because they hate their first husbands.</t5931> <t5932>Men remarry because they adore their first wives.</t5932> <t5933>Women do it to try their luck, men do it at the risk of losing theirs.</t5933><t5934>"</t5934>
<t5935>The elderly lady said, "My husband Narborough was not perfect!"</t5935>
<t5936>“If he were perfect, you wouldn't love him anyway, madam!</t5936> <t5937>Women love us for our flaws.</t5937> <t5938>If we have enough flaws, they forgive all our shortcomings, even our intelligence.</t5938> <t5939>Now that I've said this, I know you will never invite me to dinner again, my lady, but what can I do, this is the truth.</t5939><t5940>”</t5940>
<t5941>“Of course, Lord Henry.</t5941> <t5942>If we women didn't love you for your flaws, what would become of you?</t5942> <t5943>Not a single one of you would be able to marry.</t5943> <t5944>A hapless herd of bachelors!</t5944> <t5945>On the other hand, remaining single wouldn't change you much either!</t5945> <t5946>Nowadays, all married men live like bachelors, and all bachelors live as if they were married.</t5946><t5947>”</t5947>
<t5948>Lord Henry murmured, "Fin de siècle, the end of the century."</t5948>
<t5949>The landlady replied, "Fin du globe, the end of the world."</t5949>
<t5950>Dorian sighed, "I wish it were the end of the world!"</t5950> <t5951>"Living is such a great disappointment!</t5951><t5952>"</t5952>
<t5953>Putting on her gloves, the hostess said, "Ah, my dear, don't talk as if you've already exhausted life!</t5953> <t5954>When someone talks like that, it means life has exhausted them.</t5954> <t5955>Look, Lord Henry is a very bad man, very mischievous.</t5955> <t5956>Sometimes I envy him for that.</t5956> <t5957>But you were created for goodness.</t5957> <t5958>You have such an angelic appearance that I feel like finding you a nice spouse.</t5958> <t5959>Lord Henry, don't you think Mr. Gray should get married by now?</t5959><t5960>"</t5960>
<t5961>Lord Henry, bowing slightly, said, "I always keep telling him that, Lady Narborough."</t5961>
<t5962>"Alright then, let's find a suitable match for him now.</t5962> <t5963>I'll thoroughly go through Debrett's this evening and make a list of eligible young ladies for marriage.</t5963><t5964>"</t5964>
<t5965>Dorian said, "By stating their ages as well."</t5965>
<t5966>“Of course, their ages will also be mentioned, with minor retouches.</t5966> <t5967>But this job should not be rushed.</t5967> <t5968>I want this to be, as they say in The Morning Post newspaper, an appropriate composition, I want both of you to be very happy.</t5968><t5969>”</t5969>
<t5970>Lord Henry said, "How people do talk nonsense about happy marriages!"</t5970> <t5971>"A man can be happy with any woman, as long as he does not love her.</t5971><t5972>"</t5972>
<t5973>The hostess, "Ah, you, the chief of cynics!" she said, pushing her chair back and nodding to Lady Ruxton.</t5973> <t5974>"Come again for dinner soon, will you?</t5974> <t5975>You are quite an effective tonic, much more effective than Sir Andrew's prescription.</t5975> <t5976>Just tell me who you would like to be with.</t5976> <t5977>I want it to be a fun gathering.</t5977><t5978>"</t5978>
<t5979>Lord Henry replied, "I like men with a future and women with a past."</t5979> <t5980>"Or is it impossible to find men who would come to such a gathering?</t5980><t5981>"</t5981>
<t5982>The hostess stood up laughing, "I'm afraid it will be so," she said.</t5982> <t5983>Then she added, "A thousand apologies, my dear Lady Ruxton."</t5983> <t5984>"I hadn't noticed you hadn't finished your cigarette.</t5984><t5985>"</t5985>
<t5986>"No harm, Lady Narborough, I already drink too much.</t5986> <t5987>From now on, I will reduce it.</t5987><t5988>"</t5988>
<t5989>Lord Henry intervened, "My dear, don't do that, Lady Ruxton!"</t5989> <t5990>"Moderation is a disaster.</t5990> <t5991>A meal that spreads the concept of enough is a feast that spreads the concept of excess.</t5991><t5992>"</t5992>
<t5993>Lady Ruxton looked at him with curiosity.</t5993> <t5994>“One day, come and explain this to me, Lord Henry.</t5994> <t5995>It sounds like an interesting theory,” she murmured, fluttering her skirts as she left the room.</t5995>
<t5996>Lady Narborough turned at the threshold and called out, "Don't drag out your politics and gossip too much."</t5996> <t5997>"Otherwise, we will start bickering upstairs.</t5997><t5998>"</t5998>
<t5999>The men laughed.</t5999> <t6000>Mr. Chapman, with great solemnity, rose from his place at the lower end of the table and moved to the upper end.</t6000> <t6001>Dorian Gray also changed his seat and went to sit next to Lord Henry.</t6001> <t6002>Mr. Chapman began to speak loudly about the situation in the House of Commons.</t6002> <t6003>He laughed loudly whenever he mentioned his opponents.</t6003> <t6004>Among these outbursts, the word "doctrinaire" was occasionally heard.</t6004> <t6005>The word that instilled terror in the English mind.</t6005> <t6006>Mr. Chapman thought he was embellishing his speech by adding prefixes that repeated the same sound at the beginning of words.</t6006> <t6007>He hoisted the English flag to the pinnacle of thought.</t6007> <t6008>He tried to prove that the hereditary foolishness of his race – which he called solid English common sense – was the best defense for society.</t6008>
<t6009>Lord Henry turned with a smile curling on his lips and looked at Dorian.</t6009>
<t6010>“Are you feeling better, my dear friend?” he asked.</t6010> <t6011>“You seemed quite unhappy at dinner.</t6011><t6012>”</t6012>
<t6013>“I'm fine, Harry.</t6013> <t6014>Just a bit tired, that's all.</t6014><t6015>”</t6015>
<t6016>"You were very charming last night.</t6016> <t6017>Our little duchess is fond of you.</t6017> <t6018>She told me you are going to Selby.</t6018><t6019>"</t6019>
<t6020>“I will come when I am twenty, he promised.</t6020><t6021>”</t6021>
<t6022>“Is Monmouth coming too?</t6022><t6023>”</t6023>
<t6024>"Of course, Harry."</t6024><t6025>"</t6025>
<t6026>“That man is driving me crazy, at least as much as he annoys his wife!</t6026> <t6027>The Duchess is very intelligent, too intelligent for a woman.</t6027> <t6028>She lacks that indescribable charm of being delicate.</t6028> <t6029>What makes golden sculptures valuable is the mixture of clay inside them.</t6029> <t6030>In the composition of our Duchess, there is no clay.</t6030> <t6031>At most, she is white porcelain.</t6031> <t6032>She has been tested by fire!</t6032> <t6033>Fire hardens what it does not burn to ashes.</t6033> <t6034>This is a woman who has seen and experienced much.</t6034><t6035>”</t6035>
<t6036>Dorian asked, "How long have you been married?"</t6036>
<t6037>“Since time immemorial, according to what he says.</t6037> <t6038>According to the almanac of the nobles, it's ten years, I believe.</t6038> <t6039>However, ten years spent with Monmouth must have felt longer than eternity.</t6039> <t6040>Who else is coming?</t6040><t6041>”</t6041>
<t6042>“Here are the Willoughbys, Lord Rugby and his wife, our hostess, Geofreyy Clouston, the usual team.</t6042> <t6043>I also invited Lord Grotrian.</t6043><t6044>”</t6044>
<t6045>“I like him,” said Lord Henry.</t6045> <t6046>“Many do not, but I find him quite charming.</t6046> <t6047>He makes up for the occasional fault of being overdressed by always being overly cultured.</t6047> <t6048>A very contemporary type.</t6048><t6049>”</t6049>
<t6050>"I don't know if he will come or not, Harry.</t6050> <t6051>He might have to go to Monte Carlo with his father.</t6051><t6052>"</t6052>
<t6053>“Ugh, friends' families are such a headache, huh!</t6053> <t6054>Come on, Dorian, come by force if you must.</t6054> <t6055>Hey, you left very early last night.</t6055> <t6056>You got up before eleven.</t6056> <t6057>What did you do afterwards?</t6057> <t6058>Did you go straight home?</t6058><t6059>”</t6059>
<t6060>Dorian gave him a quick glance, then frowned and said, "No, it was almost three o'clock when I got home."</t6060>
<t6061>“Did you go to the cabin?</t6061><t6062>”</t6062>
<t6063>Dorian replied, "Yes," then bit his lip.</t6063> <t6064>"No, I didn't mean it that way, I didn't go to the club.</t6064> <t6065>I walked around a bit.</t6065> <t6066>I can't remember what I did now.</t6066> <t6067>You're so curious, Harry! You always want to know what people are doing.</t6067> <t6068>But I always want to forget what I've done.</t6068> <t6069>If you want to know the exact time, I came home at two-thirty.</t6069> <t6070>I had forgotten my key inside, so I had my man open the door.</t6070> <t6071>If you want corroborative evidence on this, you can ask him.</t6071><t6072>"</t6072>
<t6073>Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders.</t6073> <t6074>“Oh my friend, as if I cared!</t6074> <t6075>Let's go to the living room.</t6075> <t6076>Thank you, Mr. Chapman; I won't have any sherry.</t6076> <t6077>Dorian, there's something about you.</t6077> <t6078>What happened, tell me.</t6078> <t6079>You're not yourself at all tonight.</t6079><t6080>”</t6080>
<t6081>“Don't mind me, Harry.</t6081> <t6082>My nerves are frayed.</t6082> <t6083>I'm in a bad mood.</t6083> <t6084>I'll come knocking on your door tomorrow or the day after.</t6084> <t6085>Dear, please apologize to Lady Narborough on my behalf.</t6085> <t6086>I don't want to go upstairs.</t6086> <t6087>I'm going home.</t6087> <t6088>I must go home.</t6088><t6089>”</t6089>
<t6090>“Alright, Dorian.</t6090> <t6091>We'll see each other at tea time tomorrow, I suppose.</t6091> <t6092>The Duchess is coming too.</t6092><t6093>”</t6093>
<t6094>Dorian said, "I'll try to come," and left the room.</t6094>
<t6095>As Dorian was driving home, he noticed that the feeling of horror he thought he had overcome was reviving within him.</t6095> <t6096>Lord Henry's casual questions had made him shiver and unnerved him.</t6096> <t6097>Yet he still needed to remain calm.</t6097> <t6098>A couple of things that might arouse suspicion needed to be eliminated.</t6098> <t6099>Dorian shuddered and grimaced.</t6099> <t6100>The very thought of touching them made him feel sick.</t6100>
<t6101>But see, this task had to be done.</t6101> <t6102>Dorian was aware of this.</t6102> <t6103>After locking the door of his library from the inside, he opened the secret compartment where he had stashed Basil Hallward's coat and bag.</t6103> <t6104>A roaring fire was burning in the fireplace.</t6104> <t6105>Dorian threw another log onto it.</t6105> <t6106>The smell of scorched fabric and charred leather was nauseating.</t6106> <t6107>It took him three-quarters of an hour to burn everything to ashes.</t6107> <t6108>When he was done, he felt nauseous, almost faint.</t6108> <t6109>He burned some Algerian incense in a perforated copper brazier; he washed his forehead with a cooling vinegar mixed with musk.</t6109>
<t6110>Finally, he got up from the couch he had been lying on and went to the cabinet, opened its door, and pressed a hidden spring inside.</t6110> <t6111>Slowly, a triangular drawer emerged.</t6111> <t6112>Dorian's fingers seemed to move towards the drawer on their own, plunged inside, found something, and grasped it.</t6112> <t6113>It was a black lacquered Chinese box sprinkled with gold dust.</t6113> <t6114>Its sides were rounded and wave-shaped, with round glass beads threaded onto its silk cords, and its tassels were woven from metallic threads.</t6114> <t6115>Dorian opened the box.</t6115> <t6116>Inside was a green paste with the pallor of wax, its scent strange, heavy, and lingering.</t6116>
<t6117>Dorian paused for a moment with a strange, dull smile on his face.</t6117> <t6118>Then, despite the room being extremely warm, he shivered, straightened up, and glanced at the wall clock.</t6118> <t6119>It was twenty minutes to twelve.</t6119> <t6120>Dorian put the box back in its place, closed the closet door, and went to the bedroom.</t6120>
<t6121>As the midnight darkness struck with bronze fists, Dorian Gray, dressed like an ordinary person with a scarf wrapped around his neck, secretly left the house.</t6121> <t6122>On Rond Street, he found a carriage with a sturdy-looking horse.</t6122> <t6123>He waved and quietly gave an address to the coachman.</t6123>
<t6124>The man nodded his head.</t6124> <t6125>"I can't go, it's too far," he said.</t6125>
<t6126>"Here's a gold coin for you.</t6126> <t6127>If you drive fast, I'll give you another one.</t6127><t6128>"</t6128>
<t6129>Adam said, "Yes, sir, we will arrive in an hour."</t6129>
<t6130>After the passenger mounted, he turned his horse's head and quickly headed towards the river.</t6130>

<t6136>Chapter Sixteen</t6136>
<t6137>A cold rain had started to fall; the blurry street lamps in the splashing mist resembled dead eyes.</t6137> <t6138>It was exactly the closing time for the taverns; faint silhouettes of men and women were forming scattered groups in front of the doors.</t6138> <t6139>From some of the bars, hair-raising laughter echoed, while in others, drunks were shouting and fighting.</t6139>
<t6140>Dorian, leaning back in the car with his hat pulled down over his eyes, was gazing with a blank stare at the filthy, vile depravity of the big city and occasionally repeating to himself the words he had heard from Lord Henry on the day they first met: "To cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means of the soul..."</t6140> <t6141>Yes, that was the crux of the matter.</t6141> <t6142>Dorian had tried this many times, and now he would try it again.</t6142> <t6143>There were opium dens where "forgetfulness" could be bought with money, dens of horror where you could erase the memories of old sins with the madness of new ones.</t6143>
<t6144>The moon was swaying on the horizon like a yellow skull.</t6144> <t6145>Occasionally, a huge, crooked cloud would stretch out its long arm and hide the moon from view.</t6145> <t6146>Now the street lamps had thinned out, the streets were narrower, more enclosed.</t6146> <t6147>At one point, the coachman lost his way and had to turn back almost half a kilometer.</t6147> <t6148>Steam was rising from the body of the horse as it splashed through puddles.</t6148> <t6149>A mist cut from gray cloth had covered the side windows of the carriage.</t6149>
<t6150>“To heal the soul through the senses, and the senses through the soul!”</t6150> <t6151>How these words echoed in his ears!</t6151> <t6152>Indeed, his soul was mortally ill at this moment.</t6152> <t6153>Was it really possible for the senses to heal the soul?</t6153> <t6154>Innocent blood had been shed.</t6154> <t6155>What could pay the price for this?</t6155> <t6156>No, nothing could pay for this.</t6156> <t6157>However, even if forgiveness was not possible, forgetting was still an option.</t6157> <t6158>Dorian was determined to forget, to erase this memory, to crush and destroy it like one would crush a venomous snake that had bitten them.</t6158> <t6159>Besides, with what right had Basil said those words to him?</t6159> <t6160>Who had appointed him as a judge over others?</t6160> <t6161>He had said things that were terrible, disgusting, unbearable.</t6161>
<t6162>The carriage was still moving, but it seemed to Dorian that it was slowing down with every step.</t6162> <t6163>Dorian lifted the front flap and shouted at the driver to go faster.</t6163> <t6164>The disgusting craving for opium had started to gnaw at him.</t6164> <t6165>His throat was burning, and his slender hands were clenching and unclenching with nerves.</t6165> <t6166>He struck the horse wildly with his cane.</t6166> <t6167>The driver laughed and cracked his whip.</t6167> <t6168>When Dorian laughed in response, the man fell silent.</t6168>
<t6169>The end of the road seemed like it would never come, the roads resembled the pitch-black web of a giant spider.</t6169> <t6170>The monotony of the journey had become unbearable.</t6170> <t6171>As the fog thickened, Dorian began to feel afraid.</t6171>
<t6172>Then they began to pass by desolate brick fields.</t6172> <t6173>Here the mist had lightened; Dorian could make out those strange, bottle-shaped kilns, and the fan-shaped orange flames inside them.</t6173> <t6174>A dog barked after the carriage, and somewhere far off in the darkness, a wandering seagull cried.</t6174> <t6175>The horse stumbled and lurched as it stepped into a pothole in the road; then it reared up.</t6175>
<t6176>After a while, they left the muddy road and clattered through the bumpy cobblestone streets.</t6176> <t6177>Most of the windows around here were dark, yet occasionally, strange shadows were cast on a curtain lit by a lamp, and Dorian watched them with curiosity.</t6177> <t6178>The shadows moved like giant puppets, waving their arms as if they were living creatures.</t6178> <t6179>Dorian hated them.</t6179> <t6180>A dull resentment filled his heart.</t6180> <t6181>As they turned a corner, a woman shouted something at them from the gap of an open door; two men ran after the carriage for about a hundred steps.</t6181> <t6182>The coachman struck them with his whip.</t6182>
<t6183>They say that passion circles a person's thoughts like a ring and brings them back to where they started.</t6183> <t6184>Indeed, Dorian, with his gnawed lips, kept repeating those meaningful words about soul and sense like a disgusting chant.</t6184> <t6185>So much so that in the end, he began to find a complete explanation of his spiritual state in these words and thus justified his passions with the approval of his mind.</t6185> <t6186>But even without this approval, these passions would not withdraw their hands from his being, anyway.</t6186> <t6187>This single thought was seeping from one cell in his brain to another, and the mad desire to live, this most dreadful appetite of mankind, was giving strength to every trembling nerve and fiber like sap.</t6187> <t6188>Once, he hated ugliness because it added reality to everything, but now he found it close to himself for the same reason.</t6188> <t6189>The only reality was ugliness.</t6189> <t6190>Vulgar brawls, disgusting slums, the harsh violence of vagrant lives, the baseness of thieves, dogs, and scoundrels, the products of ugliness, were more vivid and distinct than all the beautiful forms that art entered, and all the imaginary shadows that song sang, because of the tangible intensity of the impressions they created.</t6190> <t6191>These were the things Dorian needed to forget.</t6191> <t6192>In three days, he would be free.</t6192>
<t6193>At the beginning of a dark dirt road, the coachman suddenly pulled the reins and stopped.</t6193> <t6194>Behind the low roofs of the houses here, and the jagged clusters of chimneys, black ship masts were rising.</t6194> <t6195>White rings of mist over the courtyards and spars were like ghostly sails.</t6195>
<t6196>The coachman asked in a muffled voice from behind the cover, "Somewhere around here, right, sir?"</t6196>
<t6197>Dorian shuddered and looked around.</t6197> <t6198>“This is good,” he said, quickly getting out, paid the promised fare to the driver, and then walked briskly towards the pier.</t6198> <t6199>Here and there, a lantern on the stern of a large cargo ship was shining.</t6199> <t6200>As the light flickered, the puddles were breaking into a thousand pieces.</t6200> <t6201>A crimson light was cast from a steamship taking on coal in preparation for setting sail.</t6201> <t6202>The slippery pavement resembled a wet raincoat.</t6202>
<t6203>Dorian turned left with quick steps.</t6203> <t6204>Occasionally, he looked back to see if anyone was following him.</t6204> <t6205>In seven or eight minutes, he reached a small, poor-looking house squeezed between two large factories.</t6205> <t6206>There was a lamp in one of the upper floor windows of the house.</t6206> <t6207>Dorian stopped and knocked on the door with a special password.</t6207>
<t6208>After a while, he heard footsteps walking in the corridor and the chain being unhooked.</t6208> <t6209>The door opened quietly.</t6209> <t6210>Dorian entered without saying a word to the short, crooked shadow that shrank back into the shadows as he passed.</t6210> <t6211>The green curtain at the end of the corridor was fluttering and shaking with the strong gust of wind that had followed Dorian inside.</t6211> <t6212>Dorian pushed the curtain aside and entered a low-ceilinged, long room that seemed to have once been used as a third-class dance hall.</t6212> <t6213>The light from the gas lamps flickering loudly on the walls was hitting the fly-specked mirrors in front of them, dimming and distorting.</t6213> <t6214>The oily, corrugated tin reflectors behind the lamps were forming circles of flickering light.</t6214> <t6215>The floors were covered with yellow sawdust, trampled and muddied in places, stained black in rings by spilled drinks.</t6215> <t6216>A few Malays squatting by a small coal stove were playing with bone chips, their white teeth showing as they chatted.</t6216> <t6217>In one corner, a sailor had collapsed onto a table, his head resting on his arms.</t6217> <t6218>In front of the dew-painted bar that covered an entire wall, two shabby, skinny women were mocking an old man.</t6218> <t6219>The man was shaking the cuffs of his jacket with an expression of disgust on his face.</t6219> <t6220>As Dorian passed by, one of the women laughed and said, "He thinks there are red ants on him."</t6220> <t6221>The poor man looked at her in horror, sighed, and sobbed.</t6221>
<t6222>A low staircase at the back of the room led to a dark compartment.</t6222> <t6223>As Dorian ran up the shaky three steps of the staircase, the heavy scent of opium greeted him.</t6223> <t6224>Dorian took a deep breath, his nostrils quivering with pleasure.</t6224> <t6225>When he entered, a young man with straight, blond hair, who was leaning over a lamp lighting a long, thin pipe in his hand, looked up at him and then greeted him with a bit of hesitation.</t6225>
<t6226>Dorian muttered, "So, you're here, Adrian?"</t6226>
<t6227>The other replied in a calm voice, "Where else would I be?"</t6227> <t6228>"None of our children talk to me anymore.</t6228><t6229>"</t6229>
<t6230>“I thought you had left England.</t6230><t6231>”</t6231>
<t6232>“Darlington is not going to do anything.</t6232> <t6233>My brother finally paid the bill.</t6233> <t6234>George is not talking to me either...”</t6234> <t6235>Then the young man sighed and added, “I don't care,”</t6235> <t6236>“Who needs a friend when you have this at your disposal!</t6236> <t6237>I had too many friends anyway, I guess.</t6237><t6238>”</t6238>
<t6239>Dorian winced and grimaced; he looked around at the misshapen things sprawled in impossible positions on the tattered mattresses.</t6239> <t6240>Twisted legs, gaping mouths, lifeless eyes staring blankly seemed to mesmerize him.</t6240> <t6241>He knew in which strange heavens they suffered, and the secrets of the brand-new pleasures they learned in which lightless hells.</t6241> <t6242>Their situation was better than his own.</t6242> <t6243>Because he was in the prison of his thoughts.</t6243> <t6244>Memories were gnawing at his soul like a terrible disease.</t6244> <t6245>He kept seeing the eyes of Basil Hallward looking at him.</t6245> <t6246>Yet he didn't think he could stay here.</t6246> <t6247>The presence of Adrian Singleton disturbed him.</t6247> <t6248>He wanted to be somewhere no one would recognize him.</t6248> <t6249>He wanted to escape from himself.</t6249>
<t6250>After a pause, he said, "I am going to the other place."</t6250>
<t6251>"The one on the dock?</t6251><t6252>"</t6252>
<t6253>“Yes.</t6253><t6254>”</t6254>
<t6255>“That rabid cat is definitely there.</t6255> <t6256>They don't let it in here anymore.</t6256><t6257>”</t6257>
<t6258>Dorian shrugged his shoulders.</t6258> <t6259>“I'm tired of women who fall in love with me.</t6259> <t6260>Women who bear a grudge are more interesting.</t6260> <t6261>Besides, the goods there are better.</t6261><t6262>”</t6262>
<t6263>"Hit one with the other."</t6263><t6264></t6264>
<t6265>"I like the one over there more."</t6265> <t6266>"Come and have a drink."</t6266> <t6267>"I need to drink."</t6267><t6268>"</t6268>
<t6269>The young man muttered, "I don't want anything."</t6269>
<t6270>"Don't worry.</t6270><t6271>"</t6271>
<t6272>Adrian Singleton, with a weary demeanor, got up and followed Dorian to the bar.</t6272> <t6273>A half-breed with a shabby turban and a worn-out coat greeted them with a dirty grin and placed a bottle of brandy and two glasses in front of them.</t6273> <t6274>The women approached and started to chatter.</t6274> <t6275>Dorian turned his back to them and said something in a low voice to Adrian Singleton.</t6275>
<t6276>One of the women, with a mocking smile curving on her face like Malayan daggers, sneered, "Tonight, nothing but our arrogance is visible."</t6276>
<t6277>Dorian stomped his foot and shouted, "For God's sake, don't talk to me!"</t6277> <t6278>"What do you want?</t6278> <t6279>Money? Take it.</t6279> <t6280>Don't ever speak to me again.</t6280><t6281>"</t6281>
<t6282>For a moment, two red sparks flashed in the woman's alcohol-clouded eyes, then they faded and her eyes became dull and glassy again.</t6282> <t6283>The woman threw her head back slightly, greedily raking and grabbing the coins on the bar counter with her fingers.</t6283> <t6284>Her friend was eyeing her with envy.</t6284>
<t6285>Adrian sighed, "It's pointless."</t6285> <t6286>"I don't want to go back.</t6286> <t6287>What difference does it make?</t6287> <t6288>I'm perfectly happy here.</t6288><t6289>"</t6289>
<t6290>After a pause, Dorian asked, "If you need anything, you'll write to me, won't you?"</t6290>
<t6291>“Maybe.</t6291><t6292>”</t6292>
<t6293>“Good night, then.</t6293><t6294>”</t6294>
<t6295>The young man replied, "Good night," wiping his parched lips with a handkerchief as he climbed the stairs.</t6295>
<t6296>Dorian walked towards the door with an expression on his face that showed he was in pain.</t6296> <t6297>As he drew the curtain aside, an ugly laugh burst from the painted lips of the woman who had just taken his money.</t6297> <t6298>In a raspy voice, as if caught by a sob, the woman said, "There goes the man bought by the devil!"</t6298>
<t6299>Dorian said, "Damn you."</t6299> <t6300>"Don't say that."</t6300><t6301>"</t6301>
<t6302>The woman snapped her fingers.</t6302> <t6303>“You like the name Sweet Prince, don't you?” she shouted after him.</t6303>
<t6304>Upon hearing these words, the sailor who was dozing at the table jumped up and scanned his surroundings with wild eyes.</t6304> <t6305>He heard the sound of a door closing.</t6305> <t6306>The man ran outside as if he were chasing someone.</t6306>
<t6307>Dorian Gray was walking briskly along the quay under the drizzle.</t6307><t6308>Meeting Adrian Singleton had affected him in a strangely emotional way: Was the blame for the ruin of this fresh life really to be placed on his shoulders, as Basil Hallward had so basely suggested?</t6308><t6309>Dorian bit his lip, his eyes filled with sorrow for a moment.</t6309><t6310>On the other hand, what did this matter have to do with him?</t6310><t6311>Human life was too short to bear the weight of others' mistakes.</t6311><t6312>Everyone lived their own life and paid the price for living it.</t6312><t6313>The tragic part was that a person had to pay for a single mistake many times over.</t6313><t6314>They had to keep paying, that was the truth of it.</t6314><t6315>In its dealings with humans, Fate never closed its ledger.</t6315><t6316>According to psychologists, there are moments in life when the passion for sin—or for what society deems sinful—takes such hold of a person's nature that every fiber of the body, every cell of the brain, seems to revolt with dreadful impulses.</t6316><t6317>At such times, men and women lose the independence of their will.</t6317><t6318>They move towards their impending fate like programmed machines.</t6318><t6319>The ability to choose has been taken from them.</t6319><t6320>Conscience has been killed, and if it exists at all, it lives only to add allure to rebellion and to make stubbornness seem charming.</t6320><t6321>For the source of all sin, as theologians tirelessly say, is great disobedience.</t6321><t6322>If that exalted spirit, the morning star of sin, was cast out of heaven, it was because he was rebellious.</t6322>
<t6323>With his heart hardened from being mired in sinful thoughts, his mind darkened, and his soul hungry for rebellion, Dorian Gray continued to walk at full speed, quickening his steps more and more.</t6323> <t6324>Then, as he turned into a dim archway, as he often did to take a shortcut to the bad place he was heading, he felt someone suddenly grab him from behind.</t6324> <t6325>Before he had a chance to defend himself, he was pushed against the wall, a ruthless hand gripping his throat.</t6325>
<t6326>Dorian began to struggle frantically to save his life, pulling away the fingers that were squeezing his throat with tremendous effort.</t6326> <t6327>In an instant, he heard the click of a gun, saw the glint of a polished barrel aimed at his head, and made out the silhouette of a short, stocky man standing before him.</t6327>
<t6328>"What do you want?" he asked haltingly.</t6328>
<t6329>"Shut up," said the man.</t6329> <t6330>"If you move, I'll shoot.</t6330><t6331>"</t6331>
<t6332>“Are you crazy?</t6332> <t6333>What did I ever do to you?” The man replied, “You extinguished Sibyl Vane’s life.”</t6333> <t6334>“Sibyl Vane was my sister.</t6334> <t6335>She took her own life.</t6335> <t6336>I am sure of it.</t6336> <t6337>You are the cause of her death.</t6337> <t6338>I swore to kill you in return.</t6338> <t6339>I have been searching for you for years.</t6339> <t6340>I had no trace, no clue.</t6340> <t6341>The two people who could identify you were dead.</t6341> <t6342>I knew nothing about you except the name she gave you.</t6342> <t6343>Tonight, by chance, I heard that name.</t6343> <t6344>Pray to your god, because tonight you die.</t6344><t6345>”</t6345>
<t6346>Dorian Gray felt like he was going to faint from fear.</t6346> <t6347>“I don't know him,” he stammered.</t6347> <t6348>“I haven't even heard his name.</t6348> <t6349>You are mad.</t6349><t6350>”</t6350>
<t6351>"You better confess your sin, because just as sure as my name is James Vane, you will die."</t6351> <t6352>A terrible moment passed.</t6352> <t6353>Dorian didn't know what to say or what to do.</t6353> <t6354>The man snarled, "Kneel down!"</t6354> <t6355>"I'm giving you one minute for your last prayer; you have no other time.</t6355> <t6356>We are going to India tonight.</t6356> <t6357>I need to finish this before boarding the ship.</t6357> <t6358>One single minute.</t6358> <t6359>That's all.</t6359><t6360>"</t6360>
<t6361>Dorian's arms fell to his sides.</t6361> <t6362>He was paralyzed with horror, not knowing what to do.</t6362> <t6363>Suddenly, a wild hope flashed through his mind.</t6363> <t6364>"Stop!" he shouted.</t6364> <t6365>"How long has it been since your sister died?</t6365> <t6366>Quick, tell me!</t6366><t6367>"</t6367>
<t6368>Adam replied, "Eighteen years."</t6368> <t6369>"Why are you asking?</t6369> <t6370>What difference does the year make?</t6370><t6371>"</t6371>
<t6372>Dorian Gray laughed, "Eighteen years, huh!"</t6372> <t6373>There was a tone of triumph in his voice.</t6373> <t6374>"Eighteen years!</t6374> <t6375>Take me to the base of that lantern and look at my face!</t6375><t6376>"</t6376>
<t6377>James Vane paused for a moment, unable to make any sense of what was being said.</t6377> <t6378>Then he grabbed Dorian Gray and pulled him out from under the archway.</t6378>
<t6379>Although the light of the lantern swaying in the wind was dim and flickering, it was enough to show the sailor the dreadful mistake he had made, because the face of the man he attempted to kill bore all the freshness of youth and the untainted purity of adolescence.</t6379> <t6380>This man did not look much older than a twenty-year-old boy; he did not look much older than the age his sister had remained when they parted years ago.</t6380> <t6381>It was clear that this was not the person who had extinguished Sibyl's life.</t6381>
<t6382>James Vane staggered backward, leaving Dorian.</t6382> <t6383>“Great God!” he moaned.</t6383> <t6384>“Oh my God! I was going to kill you.</t6384><t6385>”</t6385>
<t6386>Dorian Gray took a deep breath.</t6386> <t6387>Looking sternly at the man in front of him, he said, "You were about to commit an almost terrible crime, my friend."</t6387> <t6388>"Let this be a lesson to you and leave revenge to God.</t6388><t6389>"</t6389>
<t6390>James Vane, "Forgive me, sir," he murmured.</t6390> <t6391>"I was mistaken.</t6391> <t6392>A word I overheard in that godforsaken dive misled me.</t6392><t6393>"</t6393>
<t6394>Dorian said, "It would be good if you went home now and put away that gun, otherwise you might get into trouble," and then turned and walked away slowly.</t6394>
<t6395>James Vane stood frozen on the sidewalk, in horror.</t6395> <t6396>He was trembling from head to toe.</t6396> <t6397>A little later, a small, black figure that had been slowly approaching from the wet wall came into the light, and with silent, stealthy steps, it approached him.</t6397> <t6398>James Vane turned around with a start as he felt a hand touch his arm.</t6398> <t6399>It was one of the women who had been drinking in the bar.</t6399>
<t6400>Bringing her sunken face close to the man's, the woman asked in a shrill whisper, "Why didn't you kill him?"</t6400> <t6401>"When Daly rushed out from there, I knew he was after him.</t6401> <t6402>Idiot! You should have killed him.</t6402> <t6403>He has a ton of money.</t6403> <t6404>He's the worst of the worst himself.</t6404><t6405>"</t6405>
<t6406>James Vane replied, "The man I'm looking for is not him."</t6406> <t6407>"I have no interest in anyone's money.</t6407> <t6408>I want a man's life.</t6408> <t6409>The man whose life I want should be around forty years old now.</t6409> <t6410>This one here is just a young boy.</t6410> <t6411>Thank God my hands are not stained with his blood.</t6411><t6412>"</t6412>
<t6413>The woman laughed bitterly.</t6413> <t6414>"Did you say yesterday's child?" she scoffed, curling her lip.</t6414> <t6415>"My dear, it's been almost eighteen years since the Sweet Prince put me in this state!</t6415><t6416>"</t6416>
<t6417>James Vane shouted, "You are lying!"</t6417>
<t6418>The woman raised her hand towards the sky.</t6418> <t6419>“I am telling the truth in the presence of God.</t6419><t6420>”</t6420>
<t6421>“Did you say in the presence of God?</t6421><t6422>”</t6422>
<t6423>“If I'm lying, may my eyes fall out.</t6423> <t6424>He is the worst of those who haunt this place.</t6424> <t6425>They say he sold his soul to the devil to keep his face beautiful.</t6425> <t6426>It's been about eighteen years since I got to know him.</t6426> <t6427>In the meantime, he has hardly changed.</t6427> <t6428>But I have changed,” the woman added with a bitter grin.</t6428>
<t6429>“Do you swear to this?</t6429><t6430>”</t6430>
<t6431>From the woman's flat mouth, a muffled echo rose, "I swear."</t6431> <t6432>Then she pleaded, whining, "Don't tell him, please."</t6432> <t6433>"I'm afraid of him.</t6433> <t6434>Come on, give me some money so I can find a place to sleep for the night.</t6434><t6435>"</t6435>
<t6436>James Vane, cursing, wrenched his arm free from the woman's grasp and ran to the corner, but Dorian Gray was nowhere to be seen.</t6436> <t6437>When James Vane looked back, he saw that the woman had also disappeared.</t6437>
<t6438>The seventeenth chapter</t6438>
<t6439>A week had passed.</t6439> <t6440>Dorian Gray was sitting in the conservatory of Royal Selby, talking with the beautiful Duchess of Monmouth.</t6440> <t6441>The duchess's husband, a weary-looking man in his sixties, was also among the guests.</t6441> <t6442>It was tea time.</t6442> <t6443>The soft light of the large lamp with a lace shade on the table illuminated the fine porcelain and wrought silver of the tea set.</t6443> <t6444>The duchess was serving.</t6444> <t6445>As her white hands gently moved among the cups, her full red lips were smiling at something Dorian had whispered.</t6445> <t6446>Lord Henry, who was reclining in a wicker chair covered with silk, was observing them.</t6446> <t6447>Lady Narborough, who was sitting on a peach-colored sofa, was pretending to listen to the duke describing the latest Brazilian insect he had added to his collection.</t6447> <t6448>Three young men, dressed in stylish, pretentious tuxedos, were distributing cakes to the ladies.</t6448> <t6449>Twelve people had gathered at the mansion that day.</t6449> <t6450>More guests were expected to arrive the next day.</t6450>
<t6451>Lord Henry approached the table slowly, putting down his tea cup, and asked, "What are you two talking about?"</t6451> <t6452>"I hope Dorian has told you about my plan to rename everything, Gladys.</t6452> <t6453>A splendid idea.</t6453><t6454>"</t6454>
<t6455>The Duchess raised her magnificent eyes to Lord Henry's face and said, "But I don't want my name to be changed, Harry."</t6455> <t6456>"I am pleased with my own name.</t6456> <t6457>I think Mr. Gray is not complaining about his own name either.</t6457><t6458>"</t6458>
<t6459>"Dear Gladys, I wouldn't change either your name or his, even if they gave me the world.</t6459> <t6460>Both are perfect.</t6460> <t6461>I was mostly thinking about the flowers.</t6461> <t6462>Yesterday, I cut an orchid to wear on my lapel.</t6462> <t6463>It was as striking as the seven deadly sins, speckled, a wonderful thing.</t6463> <t6464>In my foolishness, I asked one of the gardeners for the name of the flower.</t6464> <t6465>He said something awful like a very rare Robinsoniana.</t6465> <t6466>A sad truth, but we have lost the ability to give beautiful names to things.</t6466> <t6467>Yet, a name means everything.</t6467> <t6468>I never quarrel with actions.</t6468> <t6469>The only thing I quarrel with are names.</t6469> <t6470>That's why I despise crude realism in literature.</t6470><t6471>"</t6471>
<t6472>The Duchess asked, "So what shall we call you, Harry?"</t6472>
<t6473>Dorian said, "His name is Prince Dilemma."</t6473>
<t6474>The Duchess clapped her hands and exclaimed, "I recognized it instantly!"</t6474>
<t6475>Lord Henry, "Don't you dare!" he said, laughing as he sank into a chair.</t6475> <t6476>"Once a person is branded, there is no escape!</t6476> <t6477>I reject this notion.</t6477><t6478>"</t6478>
<t6479>A warning fell from the Duchess's beautiful lips, "The nobles are not allowed to renounce their titles."</t6479>
<t6480>"So, you want me to defend my throne?"</t6480><t6481>"</t6481>
<t6482>“Yes.</t6482><t6483>”</t6483>
<t6484>“I will inform the truths of tomorrow.</t6484><t6485>”</t6485>
<t6486>The young woman replied, "I prefer today's mistakes."</t6486>
<t6487>Lord Henry, matching her capricious mood, said, "You are disarming me, Gladys!"</t6487>
<t6488>“I took his shield, Harry, not his spear.</t6488><t6489>”</t6489>
<t6490>Lord Henry, waving his hand slightly, said, "I never argue with beauty."</t6490>
<t6491>“That's your mistake too, believe me, Harry.</t6491> <t6492>You place too much value on beauty.</t6492><t6493>”</t6493>
<t6494>"How can you say such a thing?</t6494> <t6495>Although I admit, I am of the opinion that being beautiful is better than being virtuous.</t6495> <t6496>On the other hand, I am the first to accept that being virtuous is preferable to being ugly.</t6496><t6497>"</t6497>
<t6498>The Duchess asked, "Do you think ugliness is one of the seven deadly sins?"</t6498> <t6499>"Then what about your metaphor regarding the orchid?</t6499><t6500>"</t6500>
<t6501>“Ugliness is one of the seven deadly virtues, Gladys.</t6501> <t6502>As a loyal member of the Conservative Party, you must not underestimate these virtues.</t6502> <t6503>It is beer, the Bible, and the seven deadly virtues that have brought our England to its current state.</t6503><t6504>”</t6504>
<t6505>The Duchess asked, "So, you don't love your country very much?"</t6505>
<t6506>“I live in my homeland.</t6506><t6507>”</t6507>
<t6508>“It would be better if you criticized.</t6508><t6509>”</t6509>
<t6510>Lord Henry, "Would you like me to take Europe's view on my homeland?" he asked.</t6510>
<t6511>“What are they saying about us?</t6511><t6512>”</t6512>
<t6513>"They say Tartuffe has settled in England and is running a shop."</t6513><t6514></t6514>
<t6515>"Is this your invention, Harry?</t6515><t6516>"</t6516>
<t6517>“I present it to you.</t6517><t6518>”</t6518>
<t6519>“I can't use it!</t6519> <t6520>It's too accurate.</t6520><t6521>”</t6521>
<t6522>“There is no reason for worry.</t6522> <t6523>Our citizens cannot infer anything from the definitions.</t6523><t6524>”</t6524>
<t6525>“They are also imitators of him.</t6525><t6526>”</t6526>
<t6527>“They are more cunning than practical.</t6527> <t6528>While keeping their account books, they balance foolishness with wealth, and their bad habits with hypocrisy.</t6528><t6529>”</t6529>
<t6530>“We have accomplished great things together.</t6530><t6531>”</t6531>
<t6532>“Big things were forced upon us, Gladys.</t6532><t6533>”</t6533>
<t6534>“But we carried their loads.</t6534><t6535>”</t6535>
<t6536>“Only in the stock market.</t6536><t6537>”</t6537>
<t6538>The Duchess nodded, "I have faith in my race," she said.</t6538>
<t6539>“However, it is the picture of the torn ones that can stand, our race.</t6539><t6540>”</t6540>
<t6541>“It has shown improvement.</t6541><t6542>”</t6542>
<t6543>“Corruption concerns me more.</t6543><t6544>”</t6544>
<t6545>The Duchess asked, "And what do you say about art?"</t6545>
<t6546>“It is a disease.</t6546><t6547>”</t6547>
<t6548>“Love?</t6548><t6549>”</t6549>
<t6550>“Illusion.</t6550><t6551>”</t6551>
<t6552>“Day?</t6552><t6553>”</t6553>
<t6554>“The fashion of the day that replaces faith.</t6554><t6555>”</t6555>
<t6556>“You are skeptical.</t6556><t6557>”</t6557>
<t6558>“Not at all.</t6558> <t6559>Skepticism is the beginning of faith.</t6559><t6560>”</t6560>
<t6561>“What are you then?</t6561><t6562>”</t6562>
<t6563>“To define is to limit.</t6563><t6564>”</t6564>
<t6565>“Give me a clue.</t6565><t6566>”</t6566>
<t6567>“A string can break.</t6567> <t6568>You can get lost in the labyrinth.</t6568><t6569>”</t6569>
<t6570>"You astonish me.</t6570> <t6571>Let's talk about someone else.</t6571><t6572>"</t6572>
<t6573>“Our host is a delightful subject.</t6573> <t6574>Years ago, they named him Sweet Prince.</t6574><t6575>”</t6575>
<t6576>Dorian shouted, "Oh, don't remind me of that!"</t6576>
<t6577>The Duchess blushingly said, "Our host is a bit unpleasant tonight."</t6577> <t6578>"I think he believes Monmouth married me for purely scientific reasons; because he considers me the best example of contemporary butterflies.</t6578><t6579>"</t6579>
<t6580>Dorian laughed, "Well, then I hope she doesn't prick you with a needle, Duchess."</t6580>
<t6581>"Oh dear, my room maid often does that when she is upset with me.</t6581><t6582>"</t6582>
<t6583>“Well, why is she upset with you, Duchess?</t6583><t6584>”</t6584>
<t6585>“Believe me, Mr. Gray, it's often over the most trivial things.</t6585> <t6586>When I call him at ten to nine and tell him that I should have been dressed and ready by half-past eight, he gets upset, most of the time.</t6586><t6587>”</t6587>
<t6588>“What an inconsistent girl!</t6588> <t6589>You should let her pass.</t6589><t6590>”</t6590>
<t6591>“I can't risk it, Mr. Gray.</t6591> <t6592>This girl invents hats for me.</t6592> <t6593>Do you remember the hat I wore at Lady Hilstone's garden party?</t6593> <t6594>You don't, but you're pretending to remember because you're so sweet.</t6594> <t6595>Anyway, my maid conjured that hat out of nothing.</t6595> <t6596>All beautiful hats are conjured out of nothing.</t6596><t6597>”</t6597>
<t6598>“Like the fame of beautiful people, Gladys!” Lord Henry interjected.</t6598> <t6599>“Every effect a person creates earns them an enemy.</t6599> <t6600>To be popular in society, one must be mediocre.</t6600><t6601>”</t6601>
<t6602>The Duchess shook her head, "Not at all for women," she said.</t6602> <t6603>"It is women who rule the world.</t6603> <t6604>Believe me, we hate mediocre things.</t6604> <t6605>As someone once said, we women love with our ears, just as you men love with your eyes, that is, if you love at all.</t6605><t6606>"</t6606>
<t6607>“It seems to me that we do nothing but love,” Dorian murmured.</t6607>
<t6608>The Duchess said with a feigned sadness, "Oh! So you don't actually love it at all, Mr. Gray!"</t6608>
<t6609>Lord Henry, "Dear Gladys, how can you say that?" he exclaimed.</t6609> <t6610>"What keeps romance alive is repetition; repetition turns an appetite into art.</t6610> <t6611>Besides, every love is a unique love.</t6611> <t6612>Changing goals does not undermine the singularity of passion!</t6612> <t6613>It only serves to intensify it.</t6613> <t6614>In life, at most, we can experience one sublime moment; the secret of life is to multiply this experience as much as possible.</t6614><t6615>"</t6615>
<t6616>After a pause, the duchess asked, "Even if it has hurt a person, is that so, Harry?"</t6616>
<t6617>Lord Henry, "Especially then," he replied.</t6617>
<t6618>The Duchess turned and looked at Dorian Gray.</t6618> <t6619>There was a strange expression in her eyes.</t6619> <t6620>“What do you say to this, Mr. Gray?” she asked.</t6620>
<t6621>Dorian paused for a moment.</t6621> <t6622>Then he threw his head back and laughed.</t6622> <t6623>“I always agree with Harry's view, Duchess.</t6623><t6624>”</t6624>
<t6625>“Even when he is wrong?</t6625><t6626>”</t6626>
<t6627>“Harry is never wrong, Duchess.</t6627><t6628>”</t6628>
<t6629>“Well, does this philosophy of life give you happiness?</t6629><t6630>”</t6630>
<t6631>"I never chased after happiness!"</t6631> <t6632>"Who wants happiness?"</t6632> <t6633>"I always sought pleasure."</t6633><t6634>"</t6634>
<t6635>"And you found it, did you Mr. Gray?</t6635><t6636>"</t6636>
<t6637>“Mostly.</t6637> <t6638>More than necessary.</t6638><t6639>”</t6639>
<t6640>The Duchess sighed.</t6640> <t6641>“I am looking for peace,” she said.</t6641> <t6642>“If I don't go and get ready right now, I won't find any peace tonight.</t6642><t6643>”</t6643>
<t6644>Dorian said, "Let me pick a few orchids for you, Duchess," and got up and walked away.</t6644>
<t6645>Lord Henry said to his cousin, "You are flirting with him shamelessly."</t6645> <t6646>"You better watch your step.</t6646> <t6647>He is a charming man.</t6647><t6648>"</t6648>
<t6649>"If it weren't like that, there wouldn't be any struggle either.</t6649><t6650>"</t6650>
<t6651>“Greek against Greek, is that so?</t6651><t6652>”</t6652>
<t6653>“I am on the side of the Trojans.</t6653> <t6654>They fought for the sake of a woman.</t6654><t6655>”</t6655>
<t6656>“But they lost.</t6656><t6657>”</t6657>
<t6658>The young woman replied, "There are things worse than being imprisoned."</t6658>
<t6659>"You are going full speed with loose reins."</t6659><t6660>"</t6660>
<t6661>The Duchess retorted, "Speed creates life."</t6661>
<t6662>“Tonight I will write in my journal.</t6662><t6663>”</t6663>
<t6664>"What?</t6664><t6665>"</t6665>
<t6666>“The child whose hand is burned by fire loves the fire.</t6666><t6667>”</t6667>
<t6668>"The fire didn't touch me!</t6668> <t6669>My wings are perfectly intact.</t6669><t6670>"</t6670>
<t6671>“You use them for every purpose except flying.</t6671><t6672>”</t6672>
<t6673>"Courage has passed from men to women.</t6673> <t6674>This is something entirely new for us.</t6674><t6675>"</t6675>
<t6676>"You have a rival.</t6676><t6677>"</t6677>
<t6678>“Kim?</t6678><t6679>”</t6679>
<t6680>Lord Henry laughed.</t6680> <t6681>“Lady Narborough,” he whispered.</t6681> <t6682>“She practically worships Dorian.</t6682><t6683>”</t6683>
<t6684>"You instill fear in me!</t6684> <t6685>For romantics like us, the love for antiques is deadly.</t6685><t6686>"</t6686>
<t6687>“Did you say romantic?</t6687> <t6688>My dear, you are equipped with every method of the natural sciences.</t6688><t6689>”</t6689>
<t6690>“Men raised us.</t6690><t6691>”</t6691>
<t6692>“They also couldn't explain your secret.</t6692><t6693>”</t6693>
<t6694>The young woman defiantly said, "Go ahead, define us as a whole!"</t6694>
<t6695>“You are Sphinxes without riddles.</t6695><t6696>”</t6696>
<t6697>The Duchess looked at him with a smile.</t6697> <t6698>"Mr. Gray is taking forever!</t6698> <t6699>Let's go and help him.</t6699> <t6700>I haven't even told him the color of my dress yet.</t6700><t6701>"</t6701>
<t6702>"You should match the color of your dress to the flowers he gave you, Gladys."</t6702><t6703></t6703>
<t6704>“It would be premature to raise the white flag now.</t6704><t6705>”</t6705>
<t6706>"Romantic art begins at its peak.</t6706><t6707>"</t6707>
<t6708>“I must leave myself an opportunity to retreat if necessary.</t6708><t6709>”</t6709>
<t6710>“Like the Parthians?</t6710><t6711>”</t6711>
<t6712>“They found safety in the desert.</t6712> <t6713>I can't do this.</t6713><t6714>”</t6714>
<t6715>Lord Henry replied, "Women are not always given a choice," but before he could finish his sentence, a muffled groan was heard from the other end of the conservatory, followed immediately by a hollow thud indicating that a heavy object had fallen to the ground.</t6715> <t6716>Everyone had jumped to their feet.</t6716> <t6717>The Duchess was frozen in horror.</t6717> <t6718>Lord Henry, his eyes filled with fear, ran through the rustling broad leaves of the palm trees.</t6718> <t6719>He found Dorian Gray lying face down on the brick floor, unconscious as if dead.</t6719>
<t6720>They immediately carried Dorian to the blue salon and laid him on one of the couches.</t6720> <t6721>A little later, the young man came to his senses and looked around dazedly.</t6721>
<t6722>“What happened?” he asked.</t6722> <t6723>“Oh, I know.</t6723> <t6724>Harry, am I safe here?” She had started trembling.</t6724>
<t6725>Lord Henry replied, "Dear Dorian, you just fainted, that's all."</t6725> <t6726>"You must have overexerted yourself.</t6726> <t6727>It would be better if you didn't come to dinner.</t6727> <t6728>I'll take your place.</t6728><t6729>"</t6729>
<t6730>Dorian, "No, I will come," he said, struggling to his feet.</t6730> <t6731>"It would be better if I came.</t6731> <t6732>I shouldn't be alone.</t6732><t6733>"</t6733>
<t6734>He went up to his room and changed his clothes.</t6734> <t6735>When he sat down at the table, he was in an unrestrained, boundless joy.</t6735> <t6736>However, every now and then, the thought of having seen James Vane’s face, pressed against the greenhouse window like a white handkerchief, made him shudder with terror from head to toe.</t6736>
<t6737>Eighteenth chapter</t6737>
<t6738>The next day, Dorian did not leave the house; or rather, he spent most of his time in his own room.</t6738> <t6739>Fallen ill with a frantic fear of death, he was still indifferent to life.</t6739> <t6740>The awareness of being hunted, trapped, and about to be caught had begun to take hold of his consciousness.</t6740> <t6741>He would shudder if the wind made a curtain flutter.</t6741> <t6742>The dry leaves hitting the leaded windows were like his own wasted oaths, his mad regrets.</t6742> <t6743>Whenever he closed his eyes, he saw the sailor looking at him through that misted glass, and terror gripped his heart.</t6743>
<t6744>But perhaps it was only his own imagination that pulled this image of revenge out of the darkness of the night and set before him scenes of terrible punishment.</t6744> <t6745>Life itself was nothing but chaos, yet the thing called imagination had a tremendous logic.</t6745> <t6746>It was the imagination that sent remorse to trace the mark of sin.</t6746> <t6747>It was the imagination that gave birth to twisted offspring for every crime.</t6747> <t6748>In the world of everyday phenomena, neither the wicked were punished nor the good rewarded.</t6748> <t6749>Success was given to the strong, and defeat was handed to the weak.</t6749> <t6750>That was all.</t6750> <t6751>Besides, if a stranger had been wandering around the house, the servants and guards would have seen him.</t6751> <t6752>If footprints were found in the flower beds, the gardeners would have reported it.</t6752> <t6753>Yes, yes, it was all just imagination.</t6753> <t6754>Otherwise, Sibly Vane's brother could not have come back to kill him.</t6754> <t6755>He had boarded his ship and sailed away, now who knows in which winter seas he was rocking.</t6755> <t6756>At least Dorian had no fear from him.</t6756> <t6757>After all, the man did not know who he was!</t6757> <t6758>He could not have known.</t6758> <t6759>The mask of youth had saved him.</t6759>
<t6760>On the other hand, if what he saw was merely an illusion, how terrifying it was: to think that the conscience could create such chilling phantoms, give them visible forms, and make them move before one's eyes!</t6760> <t6761>What kind of life would his be, if the shadows of the crimes he committed were to watch him from silent corners day and night, stick their tongues out at him from hidden places, whisper in his ear at banquet tables, and wake him from his sleep with icy fingers!</t6761>
<t6762>As these thoughts passed through his mind, Dorian turned pale with fear, feeling as if the air had suddenly grown cold.</t6762><t6763>My God! How he had killed his friend in a moment of wild madness!</t6763><t6764>Even the mere memory of this scene was so dreadful!</t6764><t6765>Dorian felt as if he were seeing everything anew.</t6765><t6766>Every detail, in all its ugliness, appeared before his eyes more terrifying than ever before.</t6766><t6767>From the dark cave of time, the image of his horrifying sin, cloaked in crimson, rose up.</t6767>
<t6768>When Lord Henry came to his room at six o'clock, he found Dorian crying as if he would never be consoled again.</t6768>
<t6769>Dorian could only muster the courage to step out of his room on the third day.</t6769> <t6770>Something in the pine-scented, clear air of that winter morning seemed to have rekindled his desire and joy for life.</t6770> <t6771>Yet, it wasn't just the objective conditions of the environment that caused this change.</t6771> <t6772>His own nature had also rebelled against the excessive sorrow that tried to erode and overshadow the perfection of his existence.</t6772> <t6773>People with complex and tense temperaments are always like this.</t6773> <t6774>Very strong emotions either hurt or yield.</t6774> <t6775>They either kill or die.</t6775> <t6776>Shallow sorrows, shallow loves are long-lived.</t6776> <t6777>Great loves, great sorrows become victims of their own greatness.</t6777> <t6778>After all, Dorian had convinced himself that he was a victim of his terrified imagination, and now he recalled his fears with a bit of pity and quite a bit of disdain.</t6778>
<t6779>After breakfast, he walked in the garden with the duchess for an hour, then got into the carriage and went to join the hunting party at the other end of the park.</t6779> <t6780>The crackling frost was spread over the grass like salt.</t6780> <t6781>The sky was an inverted cup of blue metal.</t6781> <t6782>A thin layer of salt surrounded the shores of the still, reedy lake.</t6782>
<t6783>At the corner of the pine grove, Dorian saw the Duchess's brother, Sir Geoffrey Clouston.</t6783> <t6784>Sir Geoffrey was removing two spent cartridges from his rifle.</t6784> <t6785>Dorian jumped down from the carriage, told the coachman to take the mare back, and then went to his guest, passing through the dried bushes and thorny heathers.</t6785>
<t6786>“Did you hunt well, Geoffrey?” he asked.</t6786>
<t6787>“It wasn't very good, Dorian.</t6787> <t6788>I think most of the birds have been exposed.</t6788> <t6789>After dinner, it will probably be better when we go to a new area.</t6789><t6790>”</t6790>
<t6791>Dorian began to walk slowly beside him.</t6791> <t6792>The fragrant, clean, crisp air, the brown and red lights shining within the grove, the muffled shouts of the men chasing away the birds, and the sharp sounds of rifles following these shouts almost enchanted him, filling him with a sweet sense of freedom.</t6792> <t6793>The carefreeness brought by happiness, the indifference awakened by joy, now dominated all his other feelings.</t6793>
<t6794>Suddenly, from within a dense cluster of dry grass about twenty meters ahead, a rabbit with black-tipped ears sprang up, hopping on its long hind legs.</t6794> <t6795>It immediately started running towards the maple trees opposite.</t6795> <t6796>Sir Geoffrey had already shouldered his rifle.</t6796> <t6797>However, Dorian, greatly pleased by the harmony in the animal's movements, shouted at that very moment, "Geoffrey, don't shoot!"</t6797> <t6798>"Let it live!</t6798><t6799>"</t6799>
<t6800>Adam laughed, "Don't be ridiculous, Dorian!" and fired his rifle just as the rabbit darted into the thicket.</t6800> <t6801>Two cries were heard: the cry of a rabbit in pain – which is dreadful – and the even worse cry of a human in pain.</t6801>
<t6802>Sir Geoffrey shouted, "My God, I shot one of the beaters!"</t6802> <t6803>"What stupidity!</t6803> <t6804>Who stands in front of the guns?"</t6804> <t6805>Then, with all his might, he started yelling, "Hey, you over there, cease fire, a man has been shot!"</t6805>
<t6806>The head guard came running with a stick in his hand.</t6806>
<t6807>"Where, sir?</t6807> <t6808>Where is the man?" he was shouting.</t6808>
<t6809>Meanwhile, the rifle shots in the line of fire had also ceased.</t6809>
<t6810>Sir Geoffrey angrily replied, "Here," and ran towards the heath.</t6810> <t6811>"Why don't you hold your men back?</t6811> <t6812>Today's hunt is ruined!</t6812><t6813>"</t6813>
<t6814>Dorian watched them as they parted the lively, supple, swaying branches of the maple trees and plunged into the thicket.</t6814> <t6815>A few minutes later, they returned and dragged a body into the daylight behind them.</t6815> <t6816>Dorian turned his head away in horror and disgust.</t6816> <t6817>It seemed as if misfortune followed him wherever he went.</t6817> <t6818>Sir Geoffrey asked if the man was dead.</t6818> <t6819>The ranger replied, yes.</t6819> <t6820>Dorian heard this.</t6820> <t6821>Suddenly, the grove seemed to be teeming with countless human faces.</t6821> <t6822>The sound of countless footsteps and low voices could be heard.</t6822> <t6823>A large pheasant with a copper-colored chest appeared, rustling the upper branches.</t6823>
<t6824>Dorian was shaken; after a few minutes that felt like hours of agony, he felt a hand touch his shoulder.</t6824> <t6825>He turned around with a start.</t6825>
<t6826>“Dorian,” said Lord Henry.</t6826> <t6827>“I should tell everyone that the hunt is over for today.</t6827> <t6828>It would not be appropriate to continue.</t6828><t6829>”</t6829>
<t6830>Dorian bitterly said, "I wish it would end forever, Harry!"</t6830> <t6831>"A filthy, savage business! The man...</t6831><t6832>"</t6832>
<t6833>He couldn't finish his sentence.</t6833>
<t6834>Lord Henry replied, "I'm afraid so."</t6834> <t6835>"He took all the nonsense to heart.</t6835> <t6836>He must have died instantly.</t6836> <t6837>Come on, let's go home.</t6837><t6838>"</t6838>
<t6839>They walked almost fifty meters towards the main road, side by side, without speaking.</t6839> <t6840>Then Dorian looked at Lord Henry and, sighing deeply, said, "This is a bad omen, Harry,"</t6840> <t6841>"A very bad omen.</t6841><t6842>"</t6842>
<t6843>Lord Henry asked, "What?"</t6843> <t6844>"Oh, you mean that accident, I suppose.</t6844> <t6845>My dear friend, what's done is done.</t6845> <t6846>It was the man's own fault.</t6846> <t6847>Can you step in front of a gun?</t6847> <t6848>And anyway, what does it matter to us, dear?</t6848> <t6849>It's a bit awkward for Geoffrey, naturally.</t6849> <t6850>Shooting beaters is not a pleasant thing.</t6850> <t6851>Then the man gets a reputation for being a bad shot.</t6851> <t6852>But Geoffrey is not a bad shot.</t6852> <t6853>When he pulls the trigger, he hits the mark.</t6853> <t6854>Anyway, there's no point in talking about this.</t6854><t6855>"</t6855>
<t6856>Dorian nodded his head.</t6856> <t6857>"Harry, this is ominous.</t6857> <t6858>I have a feeling that something terrible is going to happen to one of us.</t6858> <t6859>Maybe to me," he added, pressing his hand to his eyes as if in pain.</t6859>
<t6860>His friend laughed.</t6860> <t6861>“The only dreadful thing in the world is boredom, Dorian.</t6861> <t6862>It is the only sin for which there is no forgiveness.</t6862> <t6863>Anyway, it is unlikely that we will suffer from this calamity, except for these guys chewing over the same topic at the table.</t6863> <t6864>I might as well tell them that the subject is taboo.</t6864> <t6865>As for the sign of bad luck, there is no such thing.</t6865> <t6866>Fate does not have the habit of sending us a warning in advance.</t6866> <t6867>It is too wise or too ruthless to do so: Besides, my dear Dorian, what could possibly happen to you?</t6867> <t6868>You have everything a person could desire.</t6868> <t6869>Anyone would gladly trade places with you.</t6869><t6870>”</t6870>
<t6871>“I would switch places with anyone who wants, Harry.</t6871> <t6872>Don't laugh like that.</t6872> <t6873>Even the wretched peasant who just died is in a better situation than me.</t6873> <t6874>I'm not afraid of death.</t6874> <t6875>What horrifies me is the approach of death.</t6875> <t6876>It's as if death's giant wings are swimming through this leaden air around us.</t6876> <t6877>My God! There's a man behind those trees, don't you see?</t6877> <t6878>He's watching me, waiting for my path.</t6878><t6879>”</t6879>
<t6880>Lord Henry shivered and looked in the direction indicated by the gloved hand.</t6880> <t6881>Smiling, he replied, "Yes."</t6881> <t6882>"I see the gardener is waiting for you.</t6882> <t6883>He probably wants to ask which flowers you want on the table tonight.</t6883> <t6884>Your nerves are ridiculously tense, my dear.</t6884> <t6885>When we return to the city, you must go see my doctor.</t6885><t6886>"</t6886>
<t6887>Dorian breathed a sigh of relief when he saw the gardener approaching.</t6887> <t6888>The man touched his hat, hesitated for a moment while looking towards Lord Henry, then took out a letter and handed it to his master.</t6888>
<t6889>“Her Grace, the Duchess, commanded me to wait and bring back a response,” he murmured.</t6889>
<t6890>Dorian put the letter in his pocket.</t6890> <t6891>Coldly, he said, "Tell Her Grace the Duchess that I am coming now."</t6891>
<t6892>Adam turned and quickly walked away towards the house.</t6892>
<t6893>Lord Henry laughed, "How women love dangerous things!" he said.</t6893> <t6894>"It is one of the qualities I admire most about them.</t6894> <t6895>As long as it is in front of everyone.</t6895><t6896>"</t6896>
<t6897>“How you love to say dangerous things, Harry! But right now, you are very wrong.</t6897> <t6898>I like Duchess very much, but I am not in love with her.</t6898><t6899>”</t6899>
<t6900>“The Duchess is very much in love with you, but she doesn't quite like you.</t6900> <t6901>So, you are equal to each other.</t6901><t6902>”</t6902>
<t6903>"You are talking about a scandal, Harry.</t6903> <t6904>However, there is no basis for a scandal.</t6904><t6905>"</t6905>
<t6906>“The basis of every scandal is an immoral confidence.</t6906><t6907>”</t6907>
<t6908>"Harry, there is no one you wouldn't sacrifice for the pleasure of a witty aphorism!"</t6908><t6909>"</t6909>
<t6910>His friend replied, "The world is a sacrificial lamb; it comes meekly and lies down under the knife."</t6910>
<t6911>Dorian Gray shouted with deep emotion, "I wish I could love!"</t6911> <t6912>"But it seems I have lost the passion to love, I have forgotten what it means to love.</t6912> <t6913>My own personality has become a burden on my shoulders.</t6913> <t6914>I have become too self-centered.</t6914> <t6915>I want to escape, to get away, to forget.</t6915> <t6916>Coming here was sheer folly.</t6916> <t6917>I'd better wire Harvey to prepare the yacht.</t6917> <t6918>On the yacht, one is safe from dangers.</t6918><t6919>"</t6919>
<t6920>“What danger, Dorian?</t6920> <t6921>You are in trouble.</t6921> <t6922>Tell me, what is it.</t6922> <t6923>You know I will help you.</t6923><t6924>”</t6924>
<t6925>Dorian said sadly, "I can't tell you, Harry."</t6925> <t6926>"Besides, it might just be a figment of my imagination.</t6926> <t6927>This troublesome accident has shaken me.</t6927> <t6928>I have a bad feeling that something like this will happen to me too.</t6928><t6929>"</t6929>
<t6930>“But you're talking nonsense!</t6930><t6931>”</t6931>
<t6932>“I hope so, but I can't suppress this feeling.</t6932> <t6933>Oh, there's the duchess, she looks like a tailor-made Artemis!</t6933> <t6934>Madam duchess, as you can see, we've come back.</t6934><t6935>”</t6935>
<t6936>The young woman said, "I heard everything, Mr. Gray."</t6936> <t6937>"Poor Geoffrey is so upset!</t6937> <t6938>I think you also told him not to shoot the rabbit.</t6938> <t6939>How strange!</t6939><t6940>"</t6940>
<t6941>“Yes, it really was strange.</t6941> <t6942>I don't know why I said that.</t6942> <t6943>It must have just come to my mind.</t6943> <t6944>The rabbit looked so cute to me: a tiny, adorable creature.</t6944> <t6945>Anyway, I was sorry to hear them talk about the dead man.</t6945> <t6946>It's a terrible situation.</t6946><t6947>”</t6947>
<t6948>Lord Henry interrupted, "A boring subject," he said.</t6948> <t6949>"It has no value from a psychological standpoint.</t6949> <t6950>Look, if Geoffrey had done this intentionally, I would indeed start to find it very interesting!</t6950> <t6951>I would really like to meet someone who has actually committed a murder.</t6951><t6952>"</t6952>
<t6953>The Duchess shouted, "What a monster you are, Harry!"</t6953> <t6954>"Isn't that right, Mr. Gray?</t6954> <t6955>Harry, Mr. Gray is feeling unwell again.</t6955> <t6956>He might faint.</t6956><t6957>"</t6957>
<t6958>Dorian forced himself to smile.</t6958> <t6959>“It's nothing, Duchess,” he murmured.</t6959> <t6960>“My nerves are terribly frayed.</t6960> <t6961>Nothing else.</t6961> <t6962>I must have walked a lot this morning.</t6962> <t6963>What did Harry say? I didn't hear.</t6963> <t6964>Was it very mischievous?</t6964> <t6965>Tell me another time.</t6965> <t6966>I should go lie down.</t6966> <t6967>You won't mind, will you?</t6967><t6968>”</t6968>
<t6969>They had reached the large staircase rising from the lemon-scented terrace.</t6969> <t6970>When the glass door closed behind Dorian, Lord Henry turned and looked at the duchess with his sleepy eyes.</t6970>
<t6971>“Are you very much in love with her?” he asked.</t6971>
<t6972>The young woman, without responding for a while, let her eyes wander over the scenery.</t6972> <t6973>Finally, she said, "If only I knew!"</t6973>
<t6974>Lord Henry nodded his head.</t6974> <t6975>"To know would be the end of everything.</t6975> <t6976>What is attractive is not knowing.</t6976> <t6977>Mist adds a wonderful beauty to everything.</t6977><t6978>"</t6978>
<t6979>“Or it confuses a person’s way.</t6979><t6980>”</t6980>
<t6981>“All roads lead to the same point, my dear Gladys.</t6981><t6982>”</t6982>
<t6983>“What is that?</t6983><t6984>”</t6984>
<t6985>“Disappointment.</t6985><t6986>”</t6986>
<t6987>The young woman sighed, "That was the first step I took in life."</t6987>
<t6988>“He came to you with a crown on his head.</t6988><t6989>”</t6989>
<t6990>“I am tired of flower petals.</t6990><t6991>”</t6991>
<t6992>“It suits you.</t6992><t6993>”</t6993>
<t6994>“Only when in the hand.</t6994><t6995>”</t6995>
<t6996>Lord Henry, "You lose it, you search for it," he said.</t6996>
<t6997>“I won't give up even a single leaf.</t6997><t6998>”</t6998>
<t6999>“Monmouth has an ear.</t6999><t7000>”</t7000>
<t7001>“In old age, ears become heavy.</t7001><t7002>”</t7002>
<t7003>“Didn't he ever get jealous of you?</t7003><t7004>”</t7004>
<t7005>"I wish he had been jealous!"</t7005><t7006>"</t7006>
<t7007>Lord Henry looked around as if searching for something.</t7007>
<t7008>The Duchess asked, "What are you looking for?"</t7008>
<t7009>“Your sword.</t7009> <t7010>You have dropped it from your hand.</t7010><t7011>”</t7011>
<t7012>The Duchess laughed.</t7012> <t7013>“My mask is still in place.</t7013><t7014>”</t7014>
<t7015>Lord Henry replied, "The mask makes your eyes look more beautiful."</t7015>
<t7016>The Duchess laughed again.</t7016> <t7017>Her teeth looked like white seeds in red fruit.</t7017>
<t7018>In his room upstairs, Dorian Gray was lying on a couch, every fiber of his being trembling with fear.</t7018> <t7019>Life had suddenly become an unbearably ugly, disgusting burden.</t7019> <t7020>The death of the unfortunate man, struck down like a wild animal among the bushes, appeared to him as a symbol foretelling his own death.</t7020> <t7021>He had felt faint when he heard the words Lord Henry had casually uttered in a moment of mockery.</t7021>
<t7022>At five o'clock, he rang the bell and called his servant: Since he would be returning to the city with the night express, he told him to prepare his bag and to have the carriage at the door by half-past eight.</t7022> <t7023>He was determined not to spend another night at Selby Royal.</t7023> <t7024>This place was filled with ominousness.</t7024> <t7025>Death roamed here in broad daylight.</t7025> <t7026>Blood had fallen on the forest grass.</t7026>
<t7027>Then he wrote a note to Lord Henry, informing him that he would go to the city to see his doctor, and asked him to entertain his guests in his absence.</t7027> <t7028>As he was putting it in the envelope, there was a knock at the door; his servant informed him that the head gamekeeper wanted to see him.</t7028> <t7029>Dorian frowned and bit his lip.</t7029> <t7030>After a moment's hesitation, he said, "Let him come in."</t7030>
<t7031>As soon as Adam entered, Dorian took the checkbook out of his drawer and placed it on the table.</t7031> <t7032>Taking his pen in hand, he said, "I assume you came for the unfortunate accident this morning, didn't you, Thornton?"</t7032>
<t7033>The ranger replied, "Yes, sir."</t7033>
<t7034>“Is the poor man married?</t7034> <t7035>Does he have anyone dependent on him?” asked Dorian wearily.</t7035> <t7036>“If there is, I don't want them to be left out in the cold.</t7036> <t7037>I'll send them some money, as much as you see fit.</t7037><t7038>”</t7038>
<t7039>"We don't know who the man is, sir.</t7039> <t7040>That's why I'm bothering you.</t7040><t7041>"</t7041>
<t7042>Dorian asked in a troubled voice, "Don't you know who he is?"</t7042> <t7043>"What do you mean?</t7043> <t7044>Isn't he one of your men?</t7044><t7045>"</t7045>
<t7046>"Yes, sir.</t7046> <t7047>Someone I've never seen before.</t7047> <t7048>He looks like a sailor, sir.</t7048><t7049>"</t7049>
<t7050>The pen fell from his hand and it was as if Dorian's heart suddenly stopped.</t7050> <t7051>“A sailor?” he shouted.</t7051> <t7052>“Did you say a sailor?</t7052><t7053>”</t7053>
<t7054>"Yes, sir.</t7054> <t7055>He looks like a sailor: He has tattoos on both arms.</t7055><t7056>"</t7056>
<t7057>Dorian leaned forward and scanned the ranger's face with surprised eyes.</t7057> <t7058>"Did anything come out of him?</t7058> <t7059>Something that shows his name or identity?</t7059><t7060>"</t7060>
<t7061>“A little money, sir; not much, a pistol.</t7061> <t7062>No name or anything.</t7062> <t7063>He looks like a gentleman, sir, but his clothes are rough.</t7063> <t7064>We think he must be a sailor or something.</t7064><t7065>”</t7065>
<t7066>Dorian jumped up from his seat.</t7066> <t7067>A tremendous hope fluttered past him.</t7067> <t7068>Dorian clung to this hope like a madman.</t7068> <t7069>“Where is the body?” he shouted.</t7069> <t7070>“Quick! I want to see it immediately.</t7070><t7071>”</t7071>
<t7072>"By the farmhouse, in an empty barn, sir.</t7072> <t7073>No one wanted to take it into the house.</t7073> <t7074>They say the presence of the dead brings bad luck.</t7074><t7075>"</t7075>
<t7076>“The farmhouse, huh! You go there immediately and wait for me.</t7076> <t7077>Tell one of the grooms to bring my horse.</t7077> <t7078>But no, never mind.</t7078> <t7079>I'll go to the stable myself.</t7079> <t7080>I'll save some time.</t7080><t7081>”</t7081>
<t7082>Before another quarter of an hour had passed, Dorian was riding his horse at full gallop along the long, tree-lined road.</t7082> <t7083>The trees flew past him like a parade of ghosts, and strange shadows seemed to throw themselves under his horse's hooves.</t7083> <t7084>At one point, when the horse suddenly veered at a white gate, it almost threw Dorian off its back.</t7084> <t7085>Dorian brought his whip down on its neck.</t7085> <t7086>The mare pierced through the dim air like an arrow, her hooves flinging stones into the air.</t7086>
<t7087>Finally, they arrived at the farmhouse.</t7087> <t7088>Two men were standing in the yard.</t7088> <t7089>Dorian jumped to the ground and threw the reins to one of the men.</t7089> <t7090>A light was shining in the stable in front of him.</t7090> <t7091>As if a voice had told him the dead body was there, Dorian quickly walked to the door and reached for the latch.</t7091>
<t7092>He paused here for a moment: He felt that he was on the verge of a discovery, one that would either save or ruin his life.</t7092> <t7093>Then he pushed the door open and entered.</t7093>
<t7094>The body of a man dressed in a coarse blue shirt and blue pants was laid on top of a pile of sacks in the opposite corner.</t7094> <t7095>A spotted handkerchief was draped over his face.</t7095> <t7096>Beside him, a cheap candle stuck into the mouth of a bottle was burning with a sputter.</t7096>
<t7097>Dorian Gray shuddered.</t7097> <t7098>Realizing that he could not lift that handkerchief himself, he called one of the laborers over.</t7098> <t7099>Holding onto the doorpost, he said, "Take that thing off his face.</t7099> <t7100>I want to see!"</t7100> <t7101>When the laborer did as he was told, Dorian stepped forward.</t7101> <t7102>A cry of joy escaped from his lips.</t7102> <t7103>The man who had been shot in the thicket was James Vane.</t7103>
<t7104>Dorian stood there for minutes, looking at the dead.</t7104> <t7105>As he rode his horse towards home, his eyes were filled with tears because he knew he had escaped the danger.</t7105>
<t7106>Nineteenth chapter</t7106>
<t7107>Lord Henry, "There is no use in saying I will be a good person," he said, dipping his white fingers into a copper bowl filled with rose water.</t7107> <t7108>"You are perfect.</t7108> <t7109>My dear, do not change.</t7109><t7110>"</t7110>
<t7111>Dorian Gray shook his head.</t7111> <t7112>"No, Harry, the ugly things I've done are more than enough.</t7112> <t7113>From now on, I repent.</t7113> <t7114>I started doing good things yesterday.</t7114><t7115>"</t7115>
<t7116>“Where were you yesterday?</t7116><t7117>”</t7117>
<t7118>“I was outside the city.</t7118> <t7119>I stayed in a small inn, alone.</t7119><t7120>”</t7120>
<t7121>Lord Henry, "My dear friend," he said with a smile.</t7121> <t7122>"Everyone behaves well outside the city.</t7122> <t7123>There is nothing seductive there.</t7123> <t7124>That is why those who live outside the city are quite far from civilization.</t7124> <t7125>Civilization is not something that is easy to attain.</t7125> <t7126>One can only reach civilization in two ways.</t7126> <t7127>One is by being cultured, the other by being immoral.</t7127> <t7128>Since those who live outside the city have no opportunity for either, they become stagnant waters covered with algae.</t7128><t7129>"</t7129>
<t7130>Repeating his friend's words, Dorian said, "Culture and immorality!"</t7130> <t7131>"I have experienced both to some extent.</t7131> <t7132>Their coexistence now terrifies me.</t7132> <t7133>Because I have adopted a new ideal.</t7133> <t7134>Harry.</t7134> <t7135>I will fundamentally change.</t7135> <t7136>I think I have already changed.</t7136><t7137>"</t7137>
<t7138>Your friend said, "You didn't mention the good thing you did.</t7138> <t7139>Or was there more than one?" and as he asked, he toppled the small, red strawberry pyramid on his plate and sprinkled powdered sugar over them with a perforated, seashell-shaped spoon.</t7139>
<t7140>"I will tell you, Harry.</t7140> <t7141>This is not something I can tell anyone else but you.</t7141> <t7142>I spared a person!</t7142> <t7143>It sounds like boasting, but you understand what I mean.</t7143> <t7144>She was truly a beautiful girl; she resembled Sibyl Vane so much, it was uncanny.</t7144> <t7145>I think that was what first attracted me to her.</t7145> <t7146>You remember Sibyl, don't you?</t7146> <t7147>How it feels like it was a million years ago!</t7147> <t7148>Anyway, Hetty was not a girl from our class, naturally.</t7148> <t7149>A simple peasant girl.</t7149> <t7150>But I truly loved her.</t7150> <t7151>I am sure that I loved her.</t7151> <t7152>During this wonderful May we had, I would go and see her two or three times a week.</t7152> <t7153>Yesterday, we met in a small orchard.</t7153> <t7154>Apple blossoms were falling into her hair, and she was laughing.</t7154> <t7155>This morning at dawn, we were determined to run away together.</t7155> <t7156>Suddenly, I decided to leave her as I found her: like a flower.</t7156><t7157>"</t7157>
<t7158>Lord Henry, "This feeling being so new and different must have given you a real thrill of pleasure, Dorian," he interjected.</t7158> <t7159>"Still, let me conclude this rustic love story for you: You gave the girl very appropriate advice and disappointed her.</t7159> <t7160>The first step you took on the right path was this.</t7160><t7161>"</t7161>
<t7162>“Harry, you are so bad!</t7162> <t7163>Don't say such unpleasant things!</t7163> <t7164>Hetty is not at all disappointed.</t7164> <t7165>She cried, of course, and so on.</t7165> <t7166>But her name wasn't tarnished!</t7166> <t7167>Just like Perdita, she can live a peaceful life in her garden full of mints and marigolds.</t7167><t7168>”</t7168>
<t7169>Lord Henry laughed, "Shedding tears for the unfaithful Florizel," and leaned back.</t7169> <t7170>"My dear Dorian, you do such strange childish things sometimes!</t7170> <t7171>Do you think this girl can now be happy with someone from her own class?</t7171> <t7172>One day she will probably marry an unrefined coachman or a grinning laborer.</t7172> <t7173>And then, having known and loved you will teach her to despise her husband.</t7173> <t7174>And the poor girl will be unhappy.</t7174> <t7175>I can't say I place much moral value on this sacrifice of yours.</t7175> <t7176>It falls short even as a start.</t7176> <t7177>Besides, how do you know, maybe Hetty is lying in a starry mill pond right now, just like Ophelia, among the beautiful water lilies?</t7177><t7178>"</t7178>
<t7179>“I can't stand it, Harry! You make fun of everything, and then you touch upon the most bitter tragedies.</t7179> <t7180>I'm now a thousand times sorry that I told you.</t7180> <t7181>No matter what you say, it doesn't matter to me.</t7181> <t7182>I know I'm doing the right thing by acting this way.</t7182> <t7183>Poor Hetty! This morning, as I passed by the farm on my horse, I saw her pale face at the window; it was like a bunch of jasmine.</t7183> <t7184>Let's not talk about this anymore.</t7184> <t7185>This is the first good thing I've done in all these years, the first sacrifice of my life!</t7185> <t7186>Don't try to convince me that this is some kind of sin.</t7186> <t7187>I want to be a better person.</t7187> <t7188>I will be a better person.</t7188> <t7189>Tell me a bit about yourself.</t7189> <t7190>What's happening in the city?</t7190> <t7191>I haven't visited the cabin for days.</t7191><t7192>”</t7192>
<t7193>“Everyone is still talking about poor Basil's disappearance.</t7193><t7194>”</t7194>
<t7195>Dorian slightly grimaced and, pouring himself some wine, said, "I thought they would have been tired of this topic by now."</t7195>
<t7196>“My dear, they've only been talking for six weeks.</t7196> <t7197>If the English society changes the topic it talks about before three months or adds an extra topic, it cannot withstand the mental stress!</t7197> <t7198>Still, they've had some luck recently.</t7198> <t7199>They talked about my divorce case, then Alan Campbell’s suicide.</t7199> <t7200>And now, the mystery of a painter's disappearance.</t7200> <t7201>Scotland Yard still insists that the man in the gray coat who left London on the midnight train on November 9th was not poor Basil.</t7201> <t7202>The French police, however, claim that Basil definitely did not set foot in Paris.</t7202> <t7203>In ten to fifteen days, we'll probably hear that he was seen in San Francisco.</t7203> <t7204>It's strange, whenever someone disappears, it's said they were seen in San Francisco.</t7204> <t7205>It must be a wonderful city; it seems all the curiosities of the other world are there.</t7205><t7206>”</t7206>
<t7207>Dorian asked, "What do you think happened to Basil?" while holding his glass of black wine up to the light.</t7207> <t7208>He was surprised at his own ability to discuss the matter so calmly.</t7208>
<t7209>“I have absolutely no idea.</t7209> <t7210>If Basil has chosen to hide, it doesn't concern me.</t7210> <t7211>If he's dead, I don't want to think about him.</t7211> <t7212>The only thing that fills me with terror is death.</t7212> <t7213>I hate death.</t7213><t7214>”</t7214>
<t7215>Dorian asked in a listless voice, "Why?"</t7215>
<t7216>Lord Henry passed the gilded cage of an open ammonia bottle under his nostrils and said, "Because nowadays one can survive any disaster except death."</t7216> <t7217>"If there are two phenomena that we haven't managed to eliminate in the nineteenth century, they are death and vulgarity.</t7217> <t7218>Dorian, let's have our coffee in the music room.</t7218> <t7219>Play me some Chopin.</t7219> <t7220>The man my wife ran away with played Chopin beautifully.</t7220> <t7221>Poor Victoria!</t7221> <t7222>I was very fond of her.</t7222> <t7223>The house feels a bit empty without her.</t7223> <t7224>Although married life is nothing but a habit, a bad habit, still one misses even the worst habits.</t7224> <t7225>Perhaps one misses the bad ones the most.</t7225> <t7226>They are such an indispensable part of one's personality.</t7226><t7227>"</t7227>
<t7228>Dorian stood up from the table without saying anything, went to the other room, and sat at the piano, letting his fingers roam over the black and white ivory keys.</t7228> <t7229>When the coffee was brought, he stopped playing the piano and looked towards Lord Henry,</t7229>
<t7230>"Harry, did it ever occur to you that Basil might have been murdered?" he asked.</t7230>
<t7231>Lord Henry yawned.</t7231> <t7232>“Basil was a much-loved person, and he always carried a Waterbury brand watch.</t7232> <t7233>Why would he be killed?</t7233> <t7234>He wasn't smart enough to make enemies.</t7234> <t7235>As a painter, he was a genius, of course.</t7235> <t7236>However, a person can paint like Velasquez and still be extremely dull and boring.</t7236> <t7237>Basil was indeed a bit dull.</t7237> <t7238>He only caught my interest once.</t7238> <t7239>That was years ago when he told you he adored you madly.</t7239> <t7240>He had said that you were the dominant force guiding his art.</t7240><t7241>”</t7241>
<t7242>Dorian said with a tremor of sadness in his voice, "I loved Basil very much."</t7242> <t7243>"But isn't there anyone saying that he was murdered?"</t7243><t7244></t7244>
<t7245>“Some newspapers write that way, but it doesn't seem like something that would happen to me.</t7245> <t7246>I know there are terrible places in Paris, but Basil is not the type of man to go to such places.</t7246> <t7247>He was never curious.</t7247> <t7248>That was his main flaw.</t7248><t7249>”</t7249>
<t7250>Dorian asked, "Harry, what would you say if I told you I killed Basil?"</t7250> <t7251>As he spoke, he did not take his eyes off his friend's face.</t7251>
<t7252>“You are playing a role that doesn't suit you, my friend, I would say.</t7252> <t7253>All serious crimes are vulgar, and at the same time, all vulgarities are serious crimes.</t7253> <t7254>Committing murder is not for you, Dorian.</t7254> <t7255>If saying this hurts your pride, I am sorry, but believe me, I am telling the truth.</t7255> <t7256>Serious crimes are entirely characteristic of the lower classes.</t7256> <t7257>I do not condemn them in the slightest.</t7257> <t7258>It seems to me that committing crimes for them is what art is for us: a method of creating extraordinary excitements.</t7258><t7259>”</t7259>
<t7260>“A method to create extraordinary excitement, huh?</t7260> <t7261>So, according to you, someone who has committed murder once can commit this crime again, right?</t7261> <t7262>This is no joke.</t7262><t7263>”</t7263>
<t7264>Lord Henry laughed, "Oh, when you go to extremes, everything becomes a pleasure."</t7264> <t7265>"This is one of the most important secrets of life.</t7265> <t7266>In my opinion, committing murder is always a mistake.</t7266> <t7267>One should never do anything that cannot be talked about after dinner.</t7267> <t7268>But let's move on from poor Basil.</t7268> <t7269>I wish the romantic end you thought of had happened to him.</t7269> <t7270>But I don't think so.</t7270> <t7271>I think he fell from the carriage into the Seine River, and the driver covered it up.</t7271> <t7272>Yes, yes, I believe that was his end.</t7272> <t7273>I can almost see it now: lying on his back under those dull green waters, with heavy barges passing over him, long water reeds tangled in his hair.</t7273> <t7274>You know, I don't think Basil could have produced much good work after this.</t7274> <t7275>The quality of his work had significantly declined in the last ten years.</t7275><t7276>"</t7276>
<t7277>Dorian sighed, Lord Henry walked to the opposite corner and began to stroke the head of an interesting Java parrot balanced on a bamboo perch.</t7277> <t7278>It was a large bird with a pink crest and tail, and gray feathers.</t7278> <t7279>When Lord Henry's pointed fingers touched it, it lowered the white shell of its wrinkled eyelids over its glassy black eyes and began to sway back and forth.</t7279>
<t7280>Lord Henry, turning back, continued, "Yes," he said.</t7280> <t7281>"The quality of his paintings had declined.</t7281> <t7282>Something was missing, in my opinion.</t7282> <t7283>An ideal had been lost.</t7283> <t7284>When his friendship with you ended, so did the greatness of his painting.</t7284> <t7285>By the way, why did you two drift apart?</t7285> <t7286>I suppose Basil must have bored you.</t7286> <t7287>In that case, he never forgave you.</t7287> <t7288>It's the nature of boring people.</t7288> <t7289>Speaking of which, he had painted a wonderful portrait of you, what happened to it?</t7289> <t7290>I don't think I ever saw it after it was finished.</t7290> <t7291>Oh, I remember; you sent it to Selby years ago and it got lost or stolen on the way.</t7291> <t7292>You never found it, did you?</t7292> <t7293>What a pity!</t7293> <t7294>It was a true masterpiece.</t7294> <t7295>I remember, I wanted to buy it.</t7295> <t7296>I wish I had!</t7296> <t7297>It was the best period of Basil's painting.</t7297> <t7298>Since then, his works have become a mix of good intentions and bad paintings, and for some reason, the man who draws this strange combination is deemed worthy of the title of exemplary English artist.</t7298> <t7299>Did you ever put out an ad for the portrait? You should.</t7299><t7300>"</t7300>
<t7301>Dorian said, "I don't remember."</t7301> <t7302>"I probably gave it away.</t7302> <t7303>Anyway, I never really liked that portrait.</t7303> <t7304>I even hate its memory.</t7304> <t7305>Why did you bring it up?</t7305> <t7306>That portrait reminded me of some strange lines I heard in a play.</t7306> <t7307>I think it was in Hamlet.</t7307> <t7308>Let me see, how did it go?</t7308>
<t7309>Like a picture of sorrow,</t7309>
<t7310>A face without a heart.</t7310>
<t7311>Yes, the portrait was just like that.</t7311><t7312>"</t7312>
<t7313>Lord Henry laughed.</t7313> <t7314>"If one treats life as a work of art, the heart is the brain," he said, sinking into an armchair.</t7314>
<t7315>Dorian Gray shook his head, then played a few soft notes on the piano.</t7315> <t7316>"Like a picture of sadness," he repeated.</t7316> <t7317>"A face without a heart.</t7317><t7318>"</t7318>
<t7319>His friend leaned back, eyeing him with half-closed eyes.</t7319> <t7320>A little later, he said, "Ah, Dorian."</t7320> <t7321>"There is a saying: A man who has lost his soul, even if he owns the whole world...</t7321> <t7322>How did it go after that?..</t7322> <t7323>How much would it be worth... was it?</t7323><t7324>"</t7324>
<t7325>The notes got mixed up; Dorian Gray started and stared at his friend's face.</t7325> <t7326>"Why are you asking me this, Harry?"</t7326>
<t7327>Lord Henry raised his eyebrows in surprise and replied, "My dear, I asked because I thought you might be able to inform me."</t7327> <t7328>"That's all.</t7328> <t7329>Last Sunday, I was passing through the park; near the Marble Arch, a group of shabbily dressed men had stopped and were listening to a scruffy street preacher.</t7329> <t7330>As I passed by, I heard the fellow shouting this question to his listeners.</t7330> <t7331>It struck me as quite dramatic.</t7331> <t7332>Our London is indeed very rich in such strange scenes.</t7332> <t7333>A rainy Sunday, a scruffy Christian in a raincoat, a tattered roof formed by dripping umbrellas, and pale white faces gathered underneath...</t7333> <t7334>Then a splendid sentence thrown into the air in a shrill, hysterical voice...</t7334> <t7335>It was truly extraordinary in its own way, quite affecting.</t7335> <t7336>I felt like telling that so-called prophet: Art has a soul, but man does not.</t7336> <t7337>But he wouldn't have understood what I meant, anyway.</t7337><t7338>"</t7338>
<t7339>“You know, Harry.</t7339> <t7340>The soul is an amazing reality.</t7340> <t7341>It can be bought, sold, and traded.</t7341> <t7342>It is possible to poison the soul or to elevate it.</t7342> <t7343>We all have a soul within us.</t7343> <t7344>I know this.</t7344><t7345>”</t7345>
<t7346>“Are you absolutely sure about this, Dorian?</t7346><t7347>”</t7347>
<t7348>“Absolutely.</t7348><t7349>”</t7349>
<t7350>“Hmm.</t7350> <t7351>It must be an illusion.</t7351> <t7352>The things one is a hundred percent sure of are never true.</t7352> <t7353>This is the disaster of faith and the lesson taught by romanticism.</t7353> <t7354>How serious you are!</t7354> <t7355>My dear, don't be so serious.</t7355> <t7356>What do you and I have to do with the blind beliefs of our age?</t7356> <t7357>No, no, we are people who have given up our belief in the existence of the soul.</t7357> <t7358>Play me something.</t7358> <t7359>Play me a nocturne, Dorian.</t7359> <t7360>And while playing, tell me in a low voice how you have kept your youth.</t7360> <t7361>You must know a secret.</t7361> <t7362>I am only ten years older than you, yet I am wrinkled, worn out, and faded.</t7362> <t7363>You truly seem to be something extraordinary.</t7363> <t7364>You remind me of the day I first saw you.</t7364> <t7365>Somewhat arrogant, very shy, you were something unseen.</t7365> <t7366>You have changed, naturally, but not in appearance.</t7366> <t7367>I wish you would tell me your secret.</t7367> <t7368>I would do anything to get my youth back: anything except exercise, getting up early, and being a respectable citizen.</t7368> <t7369>Oh youth!</t7369> <t7370>Is there anything like youth?</t7370> <t7371>How ridiculous it is to talk about the ignorance of youth!</t7371> <t7372>Nowadays, the only people whose opinions I listen to with respect are those who are considerably younger than me.</t7372> <t7373>They seem to have surpassed me.</t7373> <t7374>Life has revealed its latest marvel to them.</t7374> <t7375>As for the old; I oppose every thought of the old.</t7375> <t7376>I do this as a principle.</t7376> <t7377>Ask them their opinion about something that happened yesterday: They will tell you the views that were valid in the 1820s, the days when everyone wore long socks, believed in everything, and knew nothing.</t7377> <t7378>What you are playing is so beautiful! Did Chopin write this in Majorca?</t7378> <t7379>While the sea wept at the foot of his villa, and the salty foam hit the window panes?</t7379> <t7380>Wonderful romantic.</t7380> <t7381>What a great blessing it is that we still have at least one art form that is not imitative! Don't stop.</t7381> <t7382>I want music tonight.</t7382> <t7383>It feels as if you are Apollo, and I am Marsyas listening to you.</t7383> <t7384>Oh, Dorian, I have such sorrows of my own that even you do not know.</t7384> <t7385>The tragedy of old age is not that one is old, but that one is young.</t7385> <t7386>Sometimes I am amazed at my own sincerity.</t7386> <t7387>Oh, Dorian, how lucky you are!</t7387> <t7388>What a wonderful life you have led!</t7388> <t7389>You have lived everything to the fullest.</t7389> <t7390>You have tasted the pleasures of the world.</t7390> <t7391>There is no secret left in life for you.</t7391> <t7392>Yet you have passed through all of this as if listening to music.</t7392> <t7393>No bad trace remains on you.</t7393> <t7394>You are still what you were.</t7394><t7395>”</t7395>
<t7396>“I'm not, Harry.</t7396><t7397>”</t7397>
<t7398>“No, no, you are always the same.</t7398> <t7399>I am very curious about how your life will go on from now.</t7399> <t7400>Don't ruin it with sacrifices.</t7400> <t7401>You are perfect as you are, complete.</t7401> <t7402>Don't diminish.</t7402> <t7403>You are flawless now.</t7403> <t7404>There's no need to shake your head: you know you are flawless.</t7404> <t7405>And besides, don't deceive yourself, Dorian.</t7405> <t7406>Life is not governed by will or intention.</t7406> <t7407>Life is a matter of nerves and fibers, a matter of cells.</t7407> <t7408>Our thoughts enter and hide in these slowly forming cells, our passions dwell and dream there.</t7408> <t7409>You may think you are safe, you may believe you are strong.</t7409> <t7410>But then a shade of color that randomly catches your eye in a room or in the morning sky, the hidden memories brought by a scent you once loved, a melody from music you haven't heard in a long time, a line from a forgotten poem that reappears...</t7410> <t7411>Believe me, Dorian, our lives depend on such things.</t7411> <t7412>Browning wrote a poem on this subject.</t7412> <t7413>Then our own senses sometimes remember and dream of these things on our behalf.</t7413> <t7414>There are moments when the scent of white lilac suddenly comes to my nose, and I am forced to relive the strangest month of my life.</t7414> <t7415>Oh, Dorian, I wish I could trade places with you!</t7415> <t7416>Our surroundings often condemned both of us, but they always adored you.</t7416> <t7417>And they always will.</t7417> <t7418>You are the image that our age both seeks and fears to find.</t7418> <t7419>I am so glad you have never produced a single thing in your life!</t7419> <t7420>You have neither sculpted a statue nor painted a picture nor created anything, except yourself!</t7420> <t7421>Life became your art.</t7421> <t7422>You composed yourself.</t7422> <t7423>The days you lived are your poems.</t7423><t7424>”</t7424>
<t7425>Dorian got up from the piano and ran his hand through his hair.</t7425> <t7426>“Yes, I have led a delightful life,” he murmured.</t7426> <t7427>“However, I am not going to lead the same life, Harry.</t7427> <t7428>Don't say such extravagant things to me.</t7428> <t7429>You don't know me at all.</t7429> <t7430>If you did, I think you would turn away from me.</t7430> <t7431>You are laughing.</t7431> <t7432>Don't laugh.</t7432><t7433>”</t7433>
<t7434>“Why did you stop playing, Dorian?</t7434> <t7435>Go and play that nocturne for me again.</t7435> <t7436>Look at the huge amber-colored moon hanging in the shadowy sky.</t7436> <t7437>It is waiting for the magic of your music.</t7437> <t7438>If you play the piano, it will come closer.</t7438> <t7439>You're not playing, huh?</t7439> <t7440>Let's go to the club then.</t7440> <t7441>We had a very beautiful evening, let's end it nicely.</t7441> <t7442>There's someone at White's who is dying to meet you: Young Lord Poole.</t7442> <t7443>The eldest son of Bournemouth.</t7443> <t7444>He already wears ties like yours and keeps begging me to introduce you.</t7444> <t7445>A very charming, attractive young man, he reminds me a bit of you.</t7445><t7446>”</t7446>
<t7447>Dorian turned his eyes to the ground with a sad look and said, "I hope he doesn't resemble me."</t7447> <t7448>"I'm tired tonight, Harry.</t7448> <t7449>I'm not going to the club.</t7449> <t7450>It's almost eleven o'clock.</t7450> <t7451>I want to go to bed early.</t7451><t7452>"</t7452>
<t7453>"Please don't go.</t7453> <t7454>You have never played the piano as beautifully as you did tonight.</t7454> <t7455>Your performance tonight was marvelous.</t7455> <t7456>I have never heard you play with such meaning before.</t7456><t7457>"</t7457>
<t7458>Dorian replied with a smile, "Because I am determined to be a good person."</t7458> <t7459>"I feel like I've already changed a little bit.</t7459><t7460>"</t7460>
<t7461>Lord Henry, "In my eyes, you can never change, Dorian," he said.</t7461> <t7462>"We will remain friends for life.</t7462><t7463>"</t7463>
<t7464>"Yet once upon a time, you poisoned me with a book.</t7464> <t7465>For this reason, I should never forgive you.</t7465> <t7466>Harry, swear that you will not give this book to anyone.</t7466> <t7467>It causes a lot of harm.</t7467><t7468>"</t7468>
<t7469>"My dear boy, you've already started giving moral lessons.</t7469><t7470>At this rate, soon you'll be wandering around like those zealots who convert to religion later in life, warning everyone about the sins that once bored you.</t7470><t7471>But you're so charming that it wouldn't suit you at all to do that.</t7471><t7472>Besides, it wouldn't work anyway!</t7472><t7473>You and I are who we are, and we'll always stay that way.</t7473><t7474>As for being poisoned by books; that's impossible.</t7474><t7475>Art has no effect on action.</t7475><t7476>Art destroys the desire to act.</t7476><t7477>It has a magnificent sterility.</t7477><t7478>The books that society considers immoral are the ones that show society its own shame.</t7478><t7479>That's all.</t7479><t7480>But we're not going to have a literary debate.</t7480><t7481>Come again tomorrow.</t7481><t7482>I'm going out on horseback at eleven.</t7482><t7483>Maybe we can go together.</t7483><t7484>Then I'll take you to Lady Branksome for lunch.</t7484><t7485>She's a very charming woman.</t7485><t7486>She wanted to consult you about buying a few tapestries.</t7486><t7487>Make sure you come, okay?</t7487><t7488>Or should we have lunch with our little duchess instead?</t7488><t7489>Apparently, you two aren't seeing each other anymore.</t7489><t7490>Or have you grown tired of Gladys?</t7490><t7491>I suspected as much.</t7491><t7492>Her quick wit can get on one's nerves.</t7492><t7493>Anyway, be here at eleven.</t7493><t7494>"</t7494>
<t7495>"Do I have to come, Harry?</t7495><t7496>"</t7496>
<t7497>"It can't be."</t7497> <t7498>"The park is very beautiful this season."</t7498> <t7499>"I don't think the lilacs have ever bloomed like this since the year we met."</t7499><t7500>"</t7500>
<t7501>"Well then," said Dorian.</t7501> <t7502>"I'll come at eleven.</t7502> <t7503>Good night, Harry.</t7503><t7504>"</t7504>
<t7505>When he reached the door, he hesitated for a moment as if he had something more to say.</t7505> <t7506>Then he sighed and went outside.</t7506>
<t7507>Twentieth chapter</t7507>
<t7508>It was a splendid night.</t7508> <t7509>The weather was so warm that Dorian slung his jacket over his arm and didn't even wrap his silk scarf around his neck.</t7509> <t7510>As he wandered back home, two young men in tuxedos passed by him.</t7510> <t7511>Dorian heard one of them whisper to the other, "That's Dorian Gray!"</t7511> <t7512>He remembered how he once enjoyed being pointed at, looked at, and talked about.</t7512> <t7513>Now he was sick of hearing his own name.</t7513> <t7514>The charm of that small village he had recently frequented was that no one there knew him.</t7514> <t7515>He had told the girl who had turned his head and stolen his heart that he was a poor young man, and she had believed him.</t7515> <t7516>One day, when Dorian told her that he was a very bad person, she laughed at him, claiming that truly bad-hearted people were always very old and very ugly.</t7516> <t7517>What a beautiful laugh she had!</t7517> <t7518>Like the chirping of birds.</t7518> <t7519>How beautiful she was in those calico dresses and big hats!</t7519> <t7520>She knew nothing, but she possessed everything that Dorian had lost.</t7520>
<t7521>When Dorian arrived home, he saw that his servant had not gone to bed and was waiting for him.</t7521> <t7522>After sending him to bed, he threw himself onto the sofa in the library and began to think about some of the things Lord Henry had said.</t7522>
<t7523>Was it really true that a person could never change?</t7523> <t7524>Dorian's heart was overflowing with a wild longing for the unblemished purity of his youth – Lord Henry had once described it as rose-white.</t7524> <t7525>He had darkened his own self, filled his mind with evils, and fed his imagination with terrors; he had exerted a diabolical influence on others and derived a terrible pleasure from it; he had chosen the purest, most hopeful souls that crossed his path and driven them to shame.</t7525> <t7526>Dorian knew these things.</t7526> <t7527>And yet...</t7527> <t7528>Was it not possible to repair all this?</t7528> <t7529>Was there no hope left for Dorian?</t7529>
<t7530>Ah! How he had prayed in a moment of terrible pride and passion that his portrait might bear the burden of his days, and he himself might keep the untarnished glory of eternal youth!</t7530> <t7531>This had been the beginning of all his misfortunes.</t7531> <t7532>If only every sin he committed brought its sure, swift penalty with it, it would have been much better.</t7532> <t7533>There was something purifying in seeing punishment.</t7533> <t7534>The prayer that a man should address to a just god was not, “Forgive us our sins,” but, “Send us punishment for our mistakes.”</t7534>
<t7535>Lord Henry's intricately carved mirror, given to him years ago, stood on the table, with the white-bodied Cupids around it still laughing as before.</t7535> <t7536>Just as he had done on that dreadful night when he first noticed the change in the ominous portrait, Dorian picked up the mirror and looked into its polished shield with eyes blurred by tears of madness.</t7536> <t7537>Once, someone who was passionately in love with him had written a frenzied letter, ending it with these words: "The world changed because you were made of ivory and gold.</t7537> <t7538>The curves of your lips rewrite history."</t7538> <t7539>Dorian remembered these sentences and began to murmur them.</t7539> <t7540>Then he became disgusted with his own beauty, smashing the mirror to the ground and shattering it into silver fragments under his heels.</t7540> <t7541>It was his beauty that had ruined him; his beauty, and the youth he had prayed to God for.</t7541> <t7542>If it weren't for these two things, his life would have remained unblemished.</t7542> <t7543>Yet his beauty had become merely a mask for him, and his youth a deception.</t7543> <t7544>What was youth, even in its best sense?</t7544> <t7545>A green, unripe age, a period filled with shallow emotions and morbid thoughts.</t7545> <t7546>Why had he borne the uniform of youth?</t7546> <t7547>Youth had been his downfall.</t7547>
<t7548>It was better not to think about the past.</t7548> <t7549>Nothing could change the past anyway!</t7549> <t7550>Now, he needed to think about himself, his own future.</t7550> <t7551>James Vane was buried in an unmarked grave in the garden of Selby Church.</t7551> <t7552>Alan Campbell had shot himself one night in his laboratory, yet he had not revealed the secret he had to learn.</t7552> <t7553>The not-so-excessive excitement caused by Basil Hallward's disappearance would soon subside.</t7553> <t7554>It had already begun to subside.</t7554> <t7555>In this regard, Dorian had nothing to fear.</t7555> <t7556>To tell the truth, the thing that worried him the most was not Basil Hallward's death.</t7556> <t7557>What truly disturbed him was that his own soul had died while he was still alive.</t7557> <t7558>Basil had painted the portrait that cast a shadow over his life.</t7558> <t7559>Dorian could not forgive this.</t7559> <t7560>Everything had happened because of that portrait.</t7560> <t7561>Basil had said things to him that were intolerable, yet Dorian had shown patience and tolerated them.</t7561> <t7562>The murder was nothing but a moment of madness.</t7562> <t7563>As for Alan Campbell; his suicide was his own doing.</t7563> <t7564>Alan had chosen this action himself.</t7564> <t7565>It had nothing to do with Dorian.</t7565>
<t7566>A new life! This is what Dorian wanted.</t7566> <t7567>This is what he had been waiting for.</t7567> <t7568>In fact, he could already be considered to have started this new life.</t7568> <t7569>At least he had spared an innocent being!</t7569> <t7570>He would never again attempt to corrupt the innocent.</t7570> <t7571>He would be a good person.</t7571>
<t7572>As he thought about Hetty Merton, he began to wonder if the portrait in the locked room had changed.</t7572> <t7573>The portrait couldn't still be as disgusting and horrible as before, could it?</t7573> <t7574>Perhaps if he cleansed his life, he could erase all those traces of sin and passion from the face in the portrait as well.</t7574> <t7575>Maybe those marks of evil had already been erased.</t7575> <t7576>Dorian would go and see.</t7576>
<t7577>Taking the lamp from the table, he quietly went upstairs.</t7577> <t7578>As he pulled the door latch, a joyful smile flitted across his surprisingly youthful face and lingered on his lips for a moment.</t7578> <t7579>Yes, he would be a good person, and that disgusting thing he kept hidden would no longer frighten him.</t7579> <t7580>It already felt as if the burden on his shoulders had been lifted.</t7580>
<t7581>He entered the room silently.</t7581> <t7582>As was his habit, he locked the door behind him, then pulled the purple cover off the portrait.</t7582> <t7583>A cry of anger and pain escaped from his lips.</t7583> <t7584>He could see no change.</t7584> <t7585>There was only an expression of cunning in the eyes and a line of hypocrisy on the mouth.</t7585> <t7586>The portrait was still disgusting – even more disgusting than before – the crimson dew drops that stained his hand looked more vivid than before, resembling freshly spilled blood even more.</t7586> <t7587>Dorian began to tremble.</t7587> <t7588>Had his pride made him commit the only good deed of his life?</t7588> <t7589>Perhaps, as Lord Henry had mockingly hinted, a search for a new excitement.</t7589> <t7590>Perhaps the desire to play a role that sometimes makes us perform nobler deeds than we are.</t7590> <t7591>Perhaps all of these.</t7591> <t7592>Could it be?</t7592> <t7593>And the red stain.</t7593> <t7594>Why had it expanded?</t7594> <t7595>It seemed to have spread over those wrinkled fingers like a vile disease.</t7595> <t7596>There was blood on the feet in the picture too, as if it had dripped and oozed between the toes; even the hand that had not held the knife was bloody.</t7596> <t7597>A confession perhaps?</t7597> <t7598>Was this indicating that he should confess everything?</t7598> <t7599>Surrender, go to the gallows?</t7599> <t7600>Dorian laughed.</t7600> <t7601>That was impossible.</t7601> <t7602>Besides, even if he confessed, who would believe his words?</t7602> <t7603>There was no trace left of the murdered man.</t7603> <t7604>Everything had been disposed of.</t7604> <t7605>Dorian himself had burned those downstairs.</t7605> <t7606>Everyone would look at him as if he were mad.</t7606> <t7607>If he insisted on his words, they would lock him up in an asylum...</t7607>
<t7608>Gene de suçunu itiraf etmek, ele güne karşı mahcup olmak, cezasını çekmek de boynunun borcuydu.</t7608> <t7609>İnsanların günahlarının hesabını yalnızca öbür dünyada değil, bu dünyada da vermesini isteyen bir tanrı vardı.</t7609> <t7610>Günahını açığa vurmadıkça ne yaparsa yapsın, hiçbir şey onu arındıramazdı.</t7610> <t7611>Günahı mı?</t7611> <t7612>Dorian omuz silkti.</t7612> <t7613>Basil Hallward’ın ölümü pek umurunda değildi aslında.</t7613> <t7614>O Hetty Merton’u düşünüyordu, çünkü şu karşısındaki ayna, ruhunun aynası, ona haksızlık etmiyor muydu?</t7614> <t7615>Kibir ha? Merak? İkiyüzlülük?</t7615> <t7616>Bunlardan öte bir şey yok muydu, Hetty’den vazgeçmesinde?</t7616> <t7617>Olmaz olur muydu?</t7617> <t7618>Vardı; en azından o olduğunu sanıyordu.</t7618> <t7619>Ama kim bilebilirdi?..</t7619> <t7620>Hayır.</t7620> <t7621>Başkaca hiçbir şey yoktu!</t7621> <t7622>Dorian kibri yüzünden kızı esirgemişti.</t7622> <t7623>İkiyüzlü olduğu için iyilik maskesi takmıştı.</t7623> <t7624>Merak uğruna fedakârlığı denemişti.</t7624> <t7625>Bunları şimdi kabul ediyordu.</t7625>
<t7626>Now, about that murder...</t7626> <t7627>Would it cling to him for life?</t7627> <t7628>Would Dorian carry the burden of his past for life?</t7628> <t7629>Would he really confess his crime?</t7629> <t7630>Never.</t7630> <t7631>There was only one piece of evidence left against him: the portrait itself; the only evidence.</t7631> <t7632>Dorian would get rid of it.</t7632> <t7633>Why had he kept it for so long anyway?</t7633> <t7634>Once, he used to take pleasure in watching the picture change and age.</t7634> <t7635>Lately, even that pleasure was gone.</t7635> <t7636>He couldn't sleep at night because of this picture.</t7636> <t7637>When he was away from home, he was terrified that other eyes would see the picture.</t7637> <t7638>His fiery emotions were overshadowed by sadness because of this picture.</t7638> <t7639>The mere memory of this picture had spoiled many pleasant moments.</t7639> <t7640>It was as if the portrait had become his conscience.</t7640> <t7641>Yes, it had become his conscience.</t7641> <t7642>Dorian had to get rid of the portrait.</t7642>
<t7643>When he looked around, he saw the knife that killed Basil Hallward.</t7643> <t7644>How many times had he cleaned this knife, leaving no stain on it.</t7644> <t7645>The knife was sparkling, it was shining.</t7645> <t7646>Just as he had killed the painter, he would kill the painter's work and all its meaning.</t7646> <t7647>He would take the life of the past; when the past was dead, Dorian would be free.</t7647> <t7648>The knife would end the life of that disgusting, terrifying soul; when the portrait's warnings ceased, Dorian would find peace.</t7648> <t7649>He took the knife and stabbed the painting.</t7649>
<t7650>A shout was heard, a commotion.</t7650> <t7651>The shout was so filled with terrible agony that the servants woke up in fright, and quietly came out of their rooms.</t7651> <t7652>Two gentlemen passing through the square below looked up at the large house.</t7652> <t7653>They went ahead and found a policeman, and brought him back.</t7653> <t7654>No matter how many times the policeman rang the doorbell, there was no response.</t7654> <t7655>Except for the light in one of the upper floor windows, the whole house was dark.</t7655> <t7656>After a while, the policeman walked away, went up to the porch of one of the neighboring houses, and started observing the house from there.</t7656>
<t7657>The older of the two gentlemen asked, "Whose house is this, officer?"</t7657>
<t7658>Adam said, "Mr. Dorian Gray, sir."</t7658>
<t7659>The gentlemen exchanged glances, curling their lips in disdain as they walked away.</t7659> <t7660>One of them was a relative of Sir Henry Ashton.</t7660>
<t7661>Inside, in the servants' quarters of the house, half-naked maids were whispering to each other.</t7661> <t7662>Old Ms. Leaf was crying, rubbing her hands together.</t7662> <t7663>Francis was as pale as a corpse.</t7663>
<t7664>Fifteen minutes later, they took the coachman and one of the male servants and quietly went upstairs.</t7664> <t7665>They knocked on the door but received no answer.</t7665> <t7666>They called out.</t7666> <t7667>There was neither a sound nor a breath.</t7667> <t7668>After trying in vain to open the door, they finally climbed up to the roof and jumped onto the balcony from there.</t7668> <t7669>The glass door of the balcony opened easily; its bolt was worn out.</t7669>
<t7670>When they entered, they found a magnificent portrait of their master on the wall: Just as they had last seen him, dazzling with his unique youth and beauty, breathtaking.</t7670> <t7671>On the floor lay a man in a tuxedo, with a knife plunged into his heart.</t7671> <t7672>His face was wrinkled, sunken, extremely repulsive.</t7672> <t7673>It was only when they examined his rings that they could identify who he was.</t7673>
