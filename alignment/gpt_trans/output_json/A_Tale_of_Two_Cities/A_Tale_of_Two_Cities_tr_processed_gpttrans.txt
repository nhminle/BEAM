<t0>I</t0>
<t1>Period</t1>
<t2>It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way – in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.</t2>
<t3>On the throne of England sat a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, while on the throne of France sat a king with a large jaw and a queen with a fair face.</t3> <t4>In both countries, the nobles, who were well-fed at the expense of the people's hunger, had a belief that everything would continue forever in such a state of bliss.</t4>
<t5>It was the year 1775 AD.</t5> <t6>In this extraordinary period in England, as it is now, communication with the spirit world was commonplace.</t6> <t7>Joanna Southcott had just turned twenty-five, and years earlier, a soldier in the Guards Regiment with the gift of prophecy had proclaimed that preparations were being made for the destruction of London and Westminster, actually heralding the arrival of this exalted being into the world.</t7> <t8>It had only been twelve years since the ghost of Cock Lane, like the spirits that have recently emerged, lightly tapped on tables (never having a share of originality) and left its messages before being exorcised.</t8> <t9>Simple messages concerning worldly matters were just beginning to reach the throne and people of England from the congress of British citizens in America; interestingly, these messages turned out to be more important for all humanity than any messages received by the girls in the houses of Cock Lane.</t9>
<t10>France, which was not as ambitious in spiritual matters as her sister with the shield and trident, was printing paper money and spending it while speeding downhill.</t10><t11>Moreover, it did not kneel in the rain to pay respect to a filthy procession of priests fifty or sixty meters away, and instead entertained itself with some humane acts under the guidance of Christian priests, such as cutting off a young man's hands, tearing out his tongue with pliers, and burning his body alive.</t11><t12>Long before that poor young man was executed, some of the large trees rooted in the forests of France and Norway were likely to be cut down and turned into timber by the Woodcutter, that is, Fate, and then made into a moving wooden frame, a black mark in history, containing a sack and a knife.</t12><t13>On that very day, perhaps, clumsy carts were placed to protect from the rain in the makeshift small outbuildings of farmers working the hard soils near Paris; these were the carts, muddied by the village, sniffed by pigs, perched upon by poultry, and reserved by the Farmer, that is, Death, to transport the victims of the Revolution to the guillotine.</t13><t14>These Woodcutter and Farmer worked incessantly but very quietly, and no one heard them as they went about with their ropes; to suspect that they were awake would be blasphemy and treachery.</t14>
<t15>In England, there was almost no order and security to justify all the national boasting.</t15> <t16>Even in the capital, armed men were recklessly robbing houses and waylaying roads every night; people were advised not to leave the city without placing their belongings in upholsterers' warehouses for safety; a highwayman at night could appear as a merchant during the day; once, a man whose path was blocked by someone identifying as "Captain" turned out to be the owner of the neighboring shop, the man recognized the highwayman, challenged him, and even bravely shot him in the head and continued on his way; on another occasion, seven highwaymen ambushed a mail coach, the coach guard shot three of them but was shot by the remaining four due to "running out of ammunition."</t16> <t17>Thus, the robbery took place peacefully; then, this magnificent person, the Governor of London, was waylaid at Turnham Green, the highwayman stripped this venerable figure of everything in front of all his companions; prisoners in London prisons were fighting with the guards, the mighty law was unloading its cartridge rifles on them; thieves were cutting off diamond crosses from the necks of noble lords in palace halls; when soldiers with muskets went to St Giles to look for contraband, the people were shooting at them, and they were shooting back at the people, moreover, no one saw anything extraordinary in this.</t17> <t18>In the midst of all this, the executioner, who was always busy and more miserable than even the most useless person, was struggling to keep up with the demands; sometimes hanging a variety of criminals, sometimes hanging a thief caught on Tuesday by Saturday; sometimes branding the hands of dozens of men, sometimes burning pamphlets in front of Westminster Hall; today he would take the life of a cruel murderer, tomorrow that of a despicable thief who stole a few pennies from a farmer's son.</t18>
<t19>Here, all these events and thousands of similar ones took place in the beloved year 1775 and immediately thereafter.</t19> <t20>While things were in this state and the Woodcutter and the Farmer worked without anyone caring, those two big-jawed men and the two women, one with a grim face and the other with a clean face, continued to carry their divine right, even if their pants were on fire.</t20> <t21>Indeed, their majesty lasted throughout the year 1775, and in the same year, countless little people –among them the little people mentioned in this historical record– walked the roads that lay before them.</t21>
<t22>II</t22>
<t23>Post Coach</t23>
<t24>On a Friday night in late November, the road to Dover stretched out before the first little person in this story; the Dover mail coach was laboriously trying to climb Shooter's Hill, with the road stretching out before the man.</t24> <t25>Like the other passengers, he was trudging up the hill beside the mail coach, sinking into the mud; they were not walking for pleasure under those conditions, of course; the hill, the harness, the mud, the coach, all had become so heavy that the horses had stopped three times, even dragging the coach to the other side of the road as if they wanted to return to Blackheath with rebellious effort.</t25> <t26>However, despite having read the war-related article that stated it was forbidden to act contrary to the view that some wild animals were endowed with "reason," the whip, the coachman, and the guard persisted in what they knew; thus, the horses gave in and returned to their duties.</t26>
<t27>The horses, with their heads bowed and tails trembling, trudged through the mud, stumbling as if their legs might fall apart at the joints at any moment.</t27> <t28>Whenever the driver rested them and cautiously urged, "Deeeh! Come on now!" the horse on the left would violently shake its head and everything on it – as if it had an unusual determination to resist the cart climbing the hill.</t28> <t29>Our passenger, on the other hand, would flinch and become uneasy every time the horse moved, just like any tense traveler would.</t29>
<t30>A misty fog covered every side and drifted aimlessly up the road like a malevolent spirit seeking peace but unable to find it.</t30> <t31>The sticky, icy fog spread in rings around, like waves in an eerie sea.</t31> <t32>The fog was so dense that the car headlights could only illuminate a few meters ahead, and the steam from the rapidly breathing horses mixed with it, as if all this fog had emanated from them.</t32>
<t33>The other two passengers were also slowly advancing beside the stagecoach.</t33> <t34>All three of them were wrapped up to their cheekbones and ears, and they wore high-topped boots.</t34> <t35>None of them could tell what the others looked like; because the only part exposed was their eyes, and the contents of their minds were a mystery.</t35> <t36>In those days, passengers did not easily trust one another, as there was a high chance that one of the travelers could be a robber or his accomplice.</t36> <t37>In every inn and tavern, whether gentleman or peasant, they could be "Captain's" men.</t37> <t38>Thus, on that Friday night in November of 1775, as they barely climbed the hill, the guard of the Dover stagecoach, perched in his designated spot at the back of the coach, was thinking about these things while knocking his feet together and never taking his hand or eyes off the chest that contained six or seven loaded guns, a loaded rifle with a cartridge chamber, and a hunting knife.</t38>
<t39>The usual friendly atmosphere prevailed in the Dover mail coach, meaning that the guard was suspicious of the passengers, the passengers were suspicious of each other and the guard, in short, everyone was suspicious of everyone else. The only thing the driver was sure of was the condition of the horses; even if the world were to end, they wouldn't be able to make it up this road.</t39>
<t40>"Deeh!" said the coachman.</t40><t41>"Come on, let's go!</t41> <t42>Keep it up, we're almost at the top, you damn creatures, what a trouble you've caused us to get here! Joe!"</t42>
<t43>"Speak!" said the guard.</t43>
<t44>"What time is it, Joe?"</t44>
<t45>"It is ten past eleven."</t45><t46>"</t46>
<t47>"Come on, now!" shouted the coachman, annoyed, "we haven't even gotten out of Shooter yet! Deeh! Come on, move!"</t47>
<t48>When the leading horse felt the whip, it suddenly surged forward, followed by the other two horses.</t48> <t49>The Dover mail coach was once again struggling, accompanied by passengers trudging through the mud in their long boots.</t49> <t50>When the coach stopped, the passengers also stopped, not straying from each other's side.</t50> <t51>If one of them had the courage to suggest to another to go a bit ahead in that fog and darkness, it wouldn't be surprising if they were immediately shot as a highwayman.</t51>
<t52>With this final effort, the carriage finally reached the summit.</t52> <t53>The horses stopped to catch their breath, and after the guard placed the necessary wedge under the wheels for the descent, he opened the carriage door for the passengers to board.</t53>
<t54>The coachman shouted in a warning tone while looking down from where he was sitting, "Hey Joe!</t54><t55>"</t55>
<t56>"What's wrong, Tom?"</t56>
<t57>They both listened intently.</t57>
<t58>"There is a horse quickly approaching us, Joe."</t58><t59>"</t59>
<t60>The guard replied, "I think he's approaching at a gallop, Tom," and quickly stepped back into place, letting go of the door.</t60> <t61>"Gentlemen! Please don't move!</t61><t62>"</t62>
<t63>With this frantic plea, he cocked the rifle and went on the defensive.</t63>
<t64>The passenger who is the subject of this historical record was just getting into the carriage at that moment; the other two passengers were right behind him.</t64> <t65>The man was left half inside the carriage, half outside, standing on the step; the others were similarly on the road.</t65> <t66>They all looked at a coachman, a guard, and listened intently.</t66> <t67>The coachman looked back, then the guard looked back, and even the leading horse, following their lead, pricked up its ears and looked back.</t67>
<t68>With the cessation of the car's rattling, the added tranquility of the night made everything even quieter.</t68> <t69>The horses' breathing, as if excited, was restlessly shaking the car.</t69> <t70>The passengers' hearts were beating so fast that they could be heard from outside; indeed, this silent pause had revealed their gasping breaths, their held breaths, and their hearts pounding with the thoughts of what might happen to them.</t70>
<t71>The angry sound of the galloping horse reached the hill.</t71> <t72>The guard shouted with all his might, "Hey!"</t72> <t73>"Stop right there!</t73> <t74>Or I'll shoot!</t74><t75>"</t75>
<t76>The reins were suddenly pulled, and from the midst of the splashes of mud and the mists, a man's voice rose, "Is this the Dover mail?</t76><t77>"</t77>
<t78>The guard replied harshly, "What's it to you?"</t78> <t79>"Who are you?"</t79>
<t80>"Is this the Dover mail?"</t80><t81>"</t81>
<t82>"Why are you asking?</t82><t83>"</t83>
<t84>"If that's the case, I want to speak with a passenger.</t84><t85>"</t85>
<t86>"With which passenger?"</t86><t87>"</t87>
<t88>"with Mr. Jarvis Lorry."</t88><t89>"</t89>
<t90>Soon after, our passenger said that he was the person in question.</t90> <t91>The guard, the coachman, and the other two passengers looked at him with suspicious eyes.</t91>
<t92>The guard said to the man in the mist, "Stay where you are! If you make a mistake, you'll regret it.</t92> <t93>Mr. Lorry, please speak.</t93><t94>"</t94>
<t95>The passenger, after asking "What is the matter?" in a slightly trembling voice, said, "Who are you? Jerry, is that you?"</t95> <t96>he said.</t96>
<t97>(The guard grumbled to himself, "Is it Jerry or whatever, I didn't like the guy's voice at all,</t97><t98> his voice is even huskier than mine.")</t98>
<t99>"Yes, Mr. Lorry."</t99><t100>"</t100>
<t101>"What happened?</t101><t102>"</t102>
<t103>"They sent you a note after you left.</t103> <t104>From T. and Co.</t104><t105>"</t105>
<t106>As Mr. Lorry was stepping down from the carriage with the support of the two passengers behind him, which was more out of haste than politeness, he said, "I know this messenger, guard," meanwhile, the other two passengers had hurriedly climbed into the carriage, closed the door, and shut the window.</t106> <t107>"He may approach; there is no problem.</t107><t108>"</t108>
<t109>"I hope not, but we need to be sure," the guard said to himself tersely.</t109> <t110>"Hello!"</t110>
<t111>"Hello!" said Jerry, in a more muffled voice than before.</t111>
<t112>"Let's see you take one more step closer!</t112> <t113>If you have a weapon in your saddle, don't even think about using it.</t113> <t114>Even a small mistake will cost you dearly.</t114> <t115>Now, come closer.</t115><t116>"</t116>
<t117>The rider and the horse emerged from the swirling mist and came to the side of the carriage, where the passenger was standing.</t117> <t118>The rider leaned over, eyes on the guard, and handed a small folded paper to the passenger.</t118> <t119>The horse was out of breath, and both the horse and the rider were covered in mud from head to toe.</t119>
<t120>In a quiet tone, "Guard!" said the traveler, with the confidence of a businessman.</t120>
<t121>The guard on alert, with his right hand on the grip of the rifle he aimed, his left hand on the barrel, and his eyes on the rider, responded harshly.</t121> <t122>"Go ahead."</t122><t123>"</t123>
<t124>"There is nothing to worry about.</t124> <t125>I work at Tellson Bank.</t125> <t126>You must know the Tellson Bank in London.</t126> <t127>I am going to Paris for business.</t127> <t128>Take this crown and get yourself a drink later.</t128> <t129>Can I read now?</t129><t130>"</t130>
<t131>"Alright, but please hurry up, sir.</t131><t132>"</t132>
<t133>The passenger, opening the paper in the light of the lamp on his side of the carriage, first read it to himself, then aloud: "'Wait for Mademoiselle in Dover.</t133><t134>'</t134> <t135>See, it’s not long, guard.</t135> <t136>Jerry, you also tell them, 'Recalled to Life.</t136><t137>'"</t137>
<t138>Jerry flinched.</t138> <t139>"What a strange answer this is," he said in an even huskier voice than before.</t139>
<t140>"You tell them exactly like this, then they will understand that I took their compasses.</t140> <t141>Come on, off you go now.</t141> <t142>Good night.</t142><t143>"</t143>
<t144>After these words, the passenger opened the car door and got inside; this time there was no one to support him, the other passengers had hurriedly stuffed their watches and wallets into their boots, pretending to be asleep.</t144> <t145>Clearly, they did not want to get into trouble.</t145>
<t146>The car set off again, moving slowly and with difficulty, and the fog around had become even denser on the descent.</t146> <t147>The guard soon put the rifle back in its place and, after checking the remaining ammunition and the weapons on his belt, looked at the small box under his seat, which contained repair tools, a few lanterns, and a box of kindling.</t147> <t148>They were fully equipped, so if the car's lights were to burst and shatter, which happened quite often, all he had to do was stay inside and keep the sparks from the flint and steel away from the straw, and (if luck was on his side) immediately find light in a safe and easy way.</t148>
<t149>The driver softly called from the hill, "Tom!"</t149>
<t150>"Yes, Joe."</t150><t151>"</t151>
<t152>"Did you hear the message?</t152><t153>"</t153>
<t154>"I heard, Joe."</t154><t155>"</t155>
<t156>"What did you understand from this, Tom?"</t156>
<t157>"I didn't understand anything at all, Joe.</t157><t158>"</t158>
<t159>"What a coincidence," said the guard, "I didn't understand anything either."</t159><t160>"</t160>
<t161>Jerry, who was left alone in the midst of the drizzle and darkness, had dismounted both to let his exhausted horse recover, to wipe the mud off his face, and to empty the water that had accumulated on the brim of his hat, which was wide enough to hold nearly half a gallon.</t161> <t162>For a while, he stood there with the horse's reins on his soaking wet arms, waiting until the sound of the wheels faded and the night was once again enveloped in silence, before he set off down the hill.</t162>
<t163>Looking at his mare, "Well, old lady, you've been running since Temple Bar, your legs can't be trusted until we reach the flat," said the hoarse-voiced messenger.</t163> <t164>"'Resurrected' huh.</t164> <t165>What a strange note.</t165> <t166>This job doesn't suit you much, huh Jerry!</t166> <t167>I'm telling you, Jerry!</t167> <t168>If you were to be resurrected, you'd be in big trouble, Jerry!</t168><t169>"</t169>
<t170>III</t170>
<t171>Night shadows</t171>
<t172>The fact that every human being is an immense enigma to another, a surprising truth that requires contemplation.</t172> <t173>When I enter a large city at night, I think about how each of those clustered houses in the dark harbors its own secrets, each room in each house has a separate secret, and each heart beating within them carries a unique secret that even the heart right next to it does not know!</t173> <t174>The most terrible things, even Death, are like this.</t174> <t175>I can no longer turn the pages of this book I love, in vain I hope to have read them all one day.</t175> <t176>Once, I could no longer look into the bottomless depths of the water where the treasure and other wrecks appeared as the light shone upon them.</t176> <t177>With a single motion, it was decided that the book would be closed forever, even though I had only read one page of it.</t177> <t178>Then, as the lights played on the surface, it was decided that the water would freeze forever, and I stood there on the shore, not knowing what to do.</t178> <t179>My friend died, my neighbor died, my lover, the beloved of my soul, died; the secrets persisted with the same steadfastness, and I carried my own secret in my heart until the end of my life.</t179> <t180>In this city, among all those lying in the cemeteries I pass by, is there anyone among the city dwellers who is more mysterious to me than I am to the city dwellers?</t180>
<t181>So it turns out that the messenger on the horse, with the heritage he was born with, possessed exactly the same things as a King, a Minister, or the richest merchant in London.</t181> <t182>Each of these three passengers, cramped into the narrow space of the old, lumbering stagecoach, was a mystery to the others, as if six or sixty horsemen had settled into their own carriages and there was a country-sized distance between them and the people in the other carriages, a complete mystery.</t182>
<t183>The messenger on his horse had started to trot, occasionally stopping at bars along his route to drink something, pulling his hat down to his eyes to signal he wanted to be left alone.</t183> <t184>His eyes matched the decor well, pitch black, lacking any depth in color or shape, and –as if fearing something would happen if they were apart– set too close to each other.</t184> <t185>Under his old, three-cornered hat with upturned edges that looked like a spittoon, and over the long scarf wrapped around his chin and almost reaching his knees, his eyes had an unsettling expression.</t185> <t186>When he drank, he would part his scarf with his left hand, down the drink with his right hand, and immediately wrap himself back in the scarf.</t186>
<t187>While riding his horse, still preoccupied with the same issue, the messenger said, "No Jerry, it won't work!"</t187> <t188>"This is not for you at all, Jerry, you are an honest merchant, Jerry; you don't do such things ever!</t188> <t189>Revived-!, I bet the man was drunk!</t189><t190>"</t190>
<t191>The message had confused him so much that he frequently took off his hat to scratch his head.</t191> <t192>Except for the top of his partially bald head, his stiff and upright black hair almost reached his broad and blunt nose.</t192> <t193>It was like the work of a blacksmith; rather than a head with hair, it resembled a wall covered with long nails, so much so that even the best leapfrog players would probably find it dangerous and not want to jump over it.</t193>
<t194>When he set out from Temple Bar to deliver the message to the night watchman waiting in the booth in front of Tellson Bank so that it could be passed on to more authoritative individuals, the shadows of the night took on various forms as if they had sprung from that message, and even the mare seemed to see shapes that were extensions of entirely different things that disturbed her.</t194> <t195>Judging by how often she shied, there were many shadows on the road.</t195>
<t196>Meanwhile, the stagecoach, with its three mysterious passengers inside, was moving slowly and shakily along its arduous path.</t196> <t197>Who knows in what forms the shadows of the night appeared to their sleepy eyes and thoughtful minds.</t197>
<t198>Tellson Bank was not absent in the carriage either.</t198> <t199>The bank passenger –holding onto the leather strap to avoid bumping into the passenger next to him, and slumping into his corner as the carriage jolted– nodded his head with half-closed eyes, while the small windows of the carriage, the dim lamp casting light on them, and the large bundle of the passenger opposite him transformed into the bank, weighing down on him like a heavy task.</t199> <t200>The sound of the harnesses resembled the clinking of money; within five minutes, more forms appeared in the banker’s mind than from all the domestic and foreign connections of Tellson Bank.</t200> <t201>Then, the special rooms located underground at Tellson’s, which he knew well (and he knew quite a lot), with their vaults and secrets, came to his mind; he wandered through the rooms with large keys and a dimly lit candle in hand, seeing that everything was in its place and secure, just as he had last seen it.</t201>
<t202>Even though the bank and the mail coach (with a strange pain as if under the influence of a sleeping pill) always accompanied him, there was something else that never left his mind throughout the night.</t202> <t203>He was actually going to exhume someone from their grave.</t203>
<t204>Now, among all the faces appearing to him, which one was the face of the buried person? The shadows of the night hadn't revealed this, but all the faces he saw belonged to a man around forty-five years old. The main thing that distinguished them from each other was the ambition in their expressions and the horror of their exhausted and lost states.</t204> <t205>Pride, contempt, defiance, stubbornness, obedience, mourning always followed one another, and of course, there were the sunken cheeks, pale complexions, and hands and fingers reduced to skin and bones.</t205> <t206>But the face was the same and always completely white.</t206> <t207>The dozing traveler asked the ghost hundreds of times:</t207>
<t208>"How long have you been buried?"</t208><t209>"</t209>
<t210>The answer was always the same: "For almost eighteen years.</t210><t211>"</t211>
<t212>"Did you still have hope of being rescued?"</t212>
<t213>"My hope had long been exhausted."</t213><t214>"</t214>
<t215>"Do you know that you will rise again?</t215><t216>"</t216>
<t217>"That's what they say.</t217><t218>"</t218>
<t219>"I hope you want to be resurrected.</t219><t220>"</t220>
<t221>"I don't know.</t221><t222>"</t222>
<t223>"Shall I show it to you now?</t223> <t224>Do you want to come and see it?</t224><t225>"</t225>
<t226>The answers to this question were very varied and contradictory.</t226> <t227>Some said sadly, "Stop! If I see him right away, I'll die!"</t227> <t228>Some, with heartfelt tears, said, "Take me to him."</t228> <t229>Some, in a state of bewilderment, stared and said, "I don't know him.</t229> <t230>I don't know what you're talking about," they said.</t230>
<t231>After this imaginary conversation, the passenger, still in his dream, dug the earth to get this poor creature out – first with a shovel, then with a huge key, and finally with his hands.</t231> <t232>The man finally emerged, his face and eyes covered in soil, and as soon as he emerged, he blended into a cloud of dust.</t232> <t233>At that very moment, the passenger came to his senses and wanted to lower the window to feel the reality of the mist and rain on his cheeks.</t233>
<t234>Even though the traveler's eyes were open due to the fog and rain, the flickering light of the lamps and the trembling fences by the roadside caused the night shadows outside the car to blend with the shadows inside.</t234> <t235>The real bank next to Temple Bar, the real work he did the other day, the real vault underground, the real message sent to him, and the real reply he sent, they were all there.</t235> <t236>Then the ghostly face would reappear among them, and once again, it would approach him and ask.</t236>
<t237>"How long have you been buried?"</t237><t238>"</t238>
<t239>"Almost eighteen years."</t239><t240>"</t240>
<t241>"I hope you want to be resurrected.</t241><t242>"</t242>
<t243>"I don't know.</t243><t244>"</t244>
<t245>One of the other two passengers fidgeted impatiently until he politely asked him to close the window, then he examined the two dozing people after securing his arm in the leather loop, until his mind wandered back to the bank and the grave.</t245>
<t246>"How long have you been buried?"</t246><t247>"</t247>
<t248>"Almost eighteen years."</t248><t249>"</t249>
<t250>"Did you still have hope of being released?"</t250><t251>"</t251>
<t252>"My hope had long been exhausted."</t252><t253>"</t253>
<t254>The weary traveler, upon perceiving the daylight and realizing that the shadows of the night had vanished, still heard the words ringing in his ears – he could literally hear them all.</t254>
<t255>He rolled down the window and watched the rising sun.</t255> <t256>A plowed field stretched out on the hill ahead, with a plow left behind by horses in the middle; further beyond, a silent grove still covered with fiery red and golden yellow leaves extended.</t256> <t257>Even though the ground was cold and wet, the sky was perfectly clear, and the sun was rising slowly, shining brightly in all its beauty.</t257>
<t258>"Eighteen years!" said the traveler, looking at the sun.</t258> <t259>"My God! He was buried alive for a full eighteen years!</t259><t260>"</t260>
<t261>IV</t261>
<t262>Preparation</t262>
<t263>When the stagecoach arrived safely in Dover before noon, it was the head waiter of the Royal George Hotel who opened the door, as usual.</t263> <t264>Since traveling from London to Dover on a winter's day was not something everyone could accomplish, the passengers who managed it were always greeted with a ceremonious air.</t264>
<t265>There was only one passenger to be met that day; because the other two passengers had gotten off along the way, near the places they were going.</t265> <t266>The damp and dirty, straw-filled and moldy carriage, with its unpleasant smell and dimness, was more like a large dog kennel.</t266> <t267>As our passenger Mr. Lorry got off, shaking off the straw that clung to him, he resembled a big dog with his furry scarf, drooping hat, and muddy legs.</t267>
<t268>"There's a ferry to Calais tomorrow, right chief?"</t268><t269>"</t269>
<t270>"Yes sir, if the weather stays like this and the wind doesn't pick up, it will depart.</t270> <t271>In the afternoon, around two o'clock, the tide will be suitable for the journey, sir.</t271> <t272>Would you like a room, sir?</t272><t273>"</t273>
<t274>"I won't sleep yet, but I want a room and a barber.</t274><t275>"</t275>
<t276>"Would you like breakfast, sir?</t276> <t277>Very well, sir.</t277> <t278>This way, please, sir.</t278> <t279>Take the gentleman to Concord! Carry his luggage to Concord, prepare the hot water.</t279> <t280>Take off the gentleman's boots and leave them in Concord.</t280> <t281>(I am lighting the fireplace now, sir.</t281><t282>)</t282> <t283>Call the barber to Concord quickly.</t283> <t284>Come on, everyone to Concord!"</t284>
<t285>They always gave Concord to the stagecoach passengers, and they all entered wrapped from head to toe.</t285> <t286>Royal George attached great importance to this room, and although these guests entered in uniform, they would emerge as completely different men.</t286> <t287>That is why, as the sixty-year-old gentleman, formally dressed in his rather old but well-kept brown suit with wide square cuffs and large pocket flaps, proceeded towards the breakfast table, another waiter, two luggage-carrying boys, a bunch of servants, and the hotel proprietress were lingering at various points between Concord and the dining room as if by coincidence.</t287>
<t288>That morning, besides this brown-haired man, there was no one in the dining room.</t288> <t289>His table had been pulled in front of the fireplace, the light of the fire cast upon him, and he sat so motionless while waiting for his breakfast that anyone seeing him would think he was posing for his portrait.</t289>
<t290>With his loud clock ticking under his closed vest like a pompous sermon, countering the nimbleness and gradual disappearance of the lively fire with its own weight and longevity, he looked extremely neat and meticulous while sitting with both hands on his knees.</t290> <t291>His legs looked good, and he seemed to take pride in that; his tight brown stockings were very shapely and of good quality; his shoes and buckles were simple but very elegant.</t291> <t292>On his head was a small, light yellow, shiny, spotless, peculiar wig; it was probably made of hair but looked as if it were spun from silk or glass threads.</t292> <t293>His shirt, though not as high-quality as his stockings, was as white as the foam of waves crashing on the neighboring shore or a sailboat shining under the sun out at sea.</t293> <t294>Although his face had been subdued and silenced for years, it was illuminated by a pair of moist, bright eyes under that strange wig, and who knows what pains this face had endured until it adopted the distant and dignified expression of Tellson Bank.</t294> <t295>His cheeks had a healthy color, and the worry lines on his face were almost nonexistent.</t295> <t296>Perhaps the real occupation of this reliable bachelor clerk of Tellson Bank was other people's problems; second-hand troubles, like second-hand clothes, transient troubles.</t296>
<t297>Mr. Lorry, after sitting for a while like someone having their portrait painted, began to doze off.</t297> <t298>Then, with the arrival of his breakfast, he woke up and said to the waiter as he pulled his chair forward:</t298>
<t299>"Can you prepare a room for a young lady who might come here today?</t299> <t300>She may ask you about Mr. Jarvis Lorry or a gentleman from Tellson Bank.</t300> <t301>Please inform me.</t301><t302>"</t302>
<t303>"Of course, sir.</t303> <t304>The Tellson Bank in London, sir?</t304><t305>"</t305>
<t306>"Yes.</t306><t307>"</t307>
<t308>"Of course, sir.</t308> <t309>We often have the honor of hosting your bank's employees here as they travel between London and Paris.</t309> <t310>The employees of Tellson and Company travel so much, sir.</t310><t311>"</t311>
<t312>"Yes."</t312> <t313>"We have branches both in England and France."</t313><t314>"</t314>
<t315>"Yes, sir.</t315> <t316>But you don't travel that much, do you, sir?</t316><t317>"</t317>
<t318>"I haven't been doing it much in recent years.</t318> <t319>Our – I mean my –</t319> <t320>last return from France was fifteen years ago.</t320><t321>"</t321>
<t322>"Is that so, sir?</t322> <t323>I wasn't working here in those times, sir.</t323> <t324>There wasn't anyone from us even, sir.</t324> <t325>The George Hotel belonged to other people back then, sir.</t325><t326>"</t326>
<t327>"So that's how it is.</t327><t328>"</t328>
<t329>"But I bet you, sir, that a company like Tellson and Partners was not only big fifteen years ago, but even fifty years ago."</t329><t330>"</t330>
<t331>"Actually, you can triple this number; in fact, it was large even a hundred and fifty years ago."</t331><t332>"</t332>
<t333>"Certainly, sir!"</t333><t334>"</t334>
<t335>As the waiter backed away from the table, he rounded his mouth and eyes as if in amazement, and shifted the napkin from his right arm to his left, assuming a comfortable position. Then, as his guest ate breakfast, he stood watching him as if he were in an observatory or a watchtower.</t335> <t336>With the centuries-old tradition of waitering.</t336>
<t337>When Mr. Lorry finished his breakfast, he went for a walk by the seaside.</t337> <t338>The small town of Dover, with its winding streets, was hidden from the shore, burying its head in the white hillside like an ostrich.</t338> <t339>The shore resembled a desert where the stones rolled with the swelling waves of the sea, and the sea did whatever it wanted, which was to wreak havoc.</t339> <t340>Its roar echoed in the town, on the hillside, everywhere, turning the shore upside down.</t340> <t341>A heavy fish smell enveloped the houses so much that one would think all the sick fish had risen to the surface of the sea to mix with this air, unlike the sick people who sank to the bottom of the sea to merge with it.</t341> <t342>There was a bit of fishing in the harbor, and in the evenings, especially when the waters rose and flooded the surroundings, the place would become quite lively with walkers and sea watchers.</t342> <t343>The small tradesmen, who didn't do much business, sometimes – somehow – made great fortunes, and at those times everyone stayed away from the lighthouse keepers.</t343>
<t344>As the hours passed and the weather, which occasionally cleared enough to show the French coast, was once again shrouded in mist and humidity, Mr. Lorry's thoughts also began to cloud over.</t344> <t345>When night fell, as he sat in front of the fireplace at the dining table waiting for his dinner, just as he had waited for his breakfast, his mind dug, dug, and dug at the red-hot coals without ceasing.</t345>
<t346>A bottle of red wine to be drunk after dinner would not harm someone who had plunged into the red-hot flames; at another time, it might have distracted him from his work.</t346> <t347>After lingering for quite a while, Mr. Lorry had reached the bottom of the bottle and filled his last glass with the pleasure an old but lively man might feel, when the sound of wheels rose from the narrow street and its noise reached the front of the hotel.</t347>
<t348>He left his drink on the table without touching it.</t348> <t349>"This must be Mademoiselle!" he said.</t349>
<t350>Not long after, the waiter came in and informed that Miss Manette had arrived from London and wanted to see the person from Tellson's Bank.</t350>
<t351>"How quickly!"</t351>
<t352>Miss Manette did not want to eat anything now because she had snacked on the road, and if possible, she wanted to meet with the Tellson's employee as soon as possible.</t352>
<t353>There was nothing to be done, the Tellson employee, in a state of indifferent despair, downed the last glass, pulled his small and peculiar light yellow wig over his ears, and then followed the waiter to Miss Manette's room.</t353> <t354>It was a large and dark room, reminiscent of funeral parlors, covered with horsehair fabrics and dark-colored tables.</t354> <t355>The tables were so polished that the dim light from the two long candles on the table in the center reflected on every grain of the wood; it was as if the candles were buried deep in black mahogany graves and couldn't give proper light until they were unearthed.</t355>
<t356>The uncertainty that filled the room was so intense that Mr. Lorry, as he moved across the worn Turkish carpet, for a moment thought Miss Manette was in the adjacent room; but after passing the two candles, he saw, beside the table between them and the fireplace, a young lady who couldn't have been more than seventeen, waiting for him with her cloak on and a straw hat with ribbons in her hand.</t356> <t357>His eyes fixed on this petite, delicate figure, the golden hair, the blue eyes examining him with curiosity, and the forehead shaped by a special expression that reflected neither astonishment, nor curiosity, nor anxiety, nor merely natural interest, but rather a combination of all these (and how young and smooth it was), a scene from the past suddenly flashed before his eyes; it was a cold day, hail was falling, and the sea was very rough, and during the crossing of the English Channel, he had held a child resembling this girl in his arms throughout the journey.</t357> <t358>Just like a breath dispersing on the surface of the gloomy wall mirror behind the girl, in which some headless, all crippled, black children were lined up and offering Sodom apples in black baskets to black goddesses, his thoughts scattered – and Mr. Lorry greeted Miss Manette with a formal nod.</t358>
<t359>"Please have a seat, sir."</t359> <t360>The girl had a crystal-clear, very sweet, and youthful voice; it had a slight foreign accent, but it wasn't very noticeable.</t360>
<t361>With the courtesy of old days, bowing slightly in a formal manner, "With your permission, may I kiss your hand, young lady," said Mr. Lorry and then sat back down.</t361>
<t362>"Yesterday, I received a letter from the bank, sir, about some news – or rather, a discovery.</t362><t363>"</t363>
<t364>"Words have no physical form, young lady, either one works."</t364><t365>"</t365>
<t366>"It was about a small property left by my poor father whom I never saw – he passed away a long time ago.</t366><t367>"</t367>
<t368>Mr. Lorry fidgeted in his chair and glanced uneasily at the black children lined up in the frame of the mirror.</t368> <t369>As if they could help him by leaving those meaningless baskets!</t369>
<t370>"I absolutely have to go to Paris, I need to meet with an official from the bank there, and this person will also be in Paris for this reason."</t370><t371>"</t371>
<t372>"That person is me."</t372><t373>"</t373>
<t374>"I was expecting it to be like this, sir."</t374> <t375>The young girl greeted Mr. Lorry with a curtsy (in those days, young ladies would greet like this), as if she wanted to show that the man was much older and wiser than herself.</t375> <t376>Mr. Lorry also nodded to her once again.</t376>
<t377>"Then I immediately replied to the bank, sir, thanking them for informing me of this and advising me to go to France, and I asked them to find someone to accompany me since I have no one, saying I would be very pleased if a respectable gentleman could watch over me."</t377> <t378>"That gentleman had already set off from London; I believe they sent a messenger after him to ask him to wait for me here."</t378><t379>"</t379>
<t380>"I am happy to be deemed worthy of such a task," said Mr. Lorry, and added, "Fulfilling it will be an even greater happiness for me."</t380><t381></t381>
<t382>"Thank you very much, sir.</t382> <t383>I am truly grateful to you.</t383> <t384>They told me at the bank that this gentleman would explain the matter to me in all its details, and they even said to be prepared to be surprised.</t384> <t385>But I am ready for everything, and I am almost dying of curiosity.</t385><t386>"</t386>
<t387>"Of course," said Mr. Lorry, "You are right, I...</t387><t388>"</t388>
<t389>After pausing for a moment, she adjusted her shiny yellow wig back over her ears and added:</t389>
<t390>"I don't know where to start.</t390><t391>"</t391>
<t392>Gene had fallen silent, but in that moment of hesitation, he met the young girl's gaze.</t392> <t393>The young forehead had taken on the same special expression again – in addition to being special, it was also sweet and characteristic – and as if trying to catch a shadow, he involuntarily raised his hand.</t393>
<t394>"Could I possibly know you from somewhere, sir?</t394><t395>"</t395>
<t396>"Is that so?" Mr. Lorry opened his hands to the sides and smiled mischievously.</t396>
<t397>As the young girl settled into the chair she had been standing by for a while with a thoughtful demeanor, the expression on her face, between her eyebrows and above her tiny nose, deepened into the most delicate and pleasant line possible.</t397> <t398>Mr. Lorry observed the girl lost in thought and continued as soon as he lifted his eyes again:</t398>
<t399>"In this country, which you have accepted as your homeland, the most suitable description for you would probably be an English young lady, wouldn't it?"</t399><t400>"</t400>
<t401>"As you wish, sir.</t401><t402>"</t402>
<t403>"Miss Manette, I am a businessman.</t403> <t404>I have tasks that need to be completed.</t404> <t405>Just see me as a talking machine – I am truly nothing more than that.</t405> <t406>Now, young lady, with your permission, let me tell you the story of one of our clients.</t406><t407>"</t407>
<t408>"A story?"</t408><t409>"</t409>
<t410>Mr. Lorry hastily added, deliberately twisting the word the girl was emphasizing, "Yes, customers; we call everyone connected with us in the banking sector a customer.</t410> <t411>This gentleman was French; a scientist; he had achieved great success – he was a Doctor.</t411><t412>"</t412>
<t413>"Was he from Beauvais?"</t413>
<t414>"Ah yes, he was from Beauvais.</t414> <t415>Just like your father, Monsieur Manette, this gentleman was also from Beauvais.</t415> <t416>Again, just like your father, Monsieur Manette, this gentleman was also one of the respected figures of Paris.</t416> <t417>I had the honor of meeting him there.</t417> <t418>Our relationship was based on business, but it was secret.</t418> <t419>At that time, I was in the French branch of the bank, I stayed there for quite a while, that is – oh! twenty years.</t419><t420>"</t420>
<t421>"When you say then – exactly what time are you referring to, sir?</t421><t422>"</t422>
<t423>"I am talking about twenty years ago, young lady.</t423> <t424>This gentleman was married to an English lady, and I used to handle his affairs.</t424> <t425>In fact, all his affairs, like those of all other French gentlemen and families, were handled by Tellson Bank.</t425> <t426>Similarly, now I look after the various accounts of our clients.</t426> <t427>These are just business relationships, young lady; they contain neither friendship, nor special interest, nor emotion.</t427> <t428>Just like the many clients I visit during the day, throughout my entire business life I have always gone from client to client; in short, I have no emotions; I am merely a machine.</t428> <t429>Where was I...</t429><t430>"</t430>
<t431>"But this is my father's story, sir, and if I'm not mistaken," –the girl's forehead wrinkled with curiosity, her gaze fixed intently on the man– "it was you who brought me to England after I lost my mother two years after my father and became an orphan.</t431> <t432>I'm sure of it.</t432><t433>"</t433>
<t434>Mr. Lorry, taking the girl's hand which first extended hesitantly and then confidently, ceremoniously brought it to his lips.</t434> <t435>Then he led her to her chair and, while holding the back of the chair with his left hand, he alternately stroked his chin, adjusted his wig towards his ears, or pointed to something he was saying; the girl watched from her seat, and Mr. Lorry from where he stood, observing each other.</t435>
<t436>"Miss Manette, yes it was me.</t436> <t437>You see how truthful I was when I said I had no feelings and that my connections were purely business, then I never saw you again.</t437> <t438>But of course, even though I have been involved in various other matters, you have been under the guardianship of Tellson Bank since that time.</t438> <t439>Feelings! I have no time to spare for them at all.</t439> <t440>My life has been spent turning a great money wheel.</t440><t441>"</t441>
<t442>After this strange description of the work routine, Mr. Lorry pressed his bright light yellow wig firmly onto his head with both hands (what an unnecessary action this was, as that shiny surface was already quite flat) and resumed his previous posture.</t442>
<t443>"So, young lady –as you also mentioned– this was the story of your poor father up to this point.</t443> <t444>But now it changes.</t444> <t445>What if the father you thought was dead had not died –Don't be afraid, dear!</t445> <t446>How you flinched!</t446><t447>"</t447>
<t448>The young girl was truly startled.</t448> <t449>She tightly grabbed Mr. Lorry's wrist with both hands.</t449>
<t450>"Please," said Mr. Lorry in a calming tone, placing his left hand, which he had pulled from behind the chair, onto the pleading fingers that were trembling violently on his wrist, "please calm down – this is just business after all.</t450> <t451>What was I saying-"</t451>
<t452>Mr. Lorry was so disturbed by the girl's gaze that he fell silent, waited for a while, and then continued from where he left off.</t452>
<t453>"Where were we?</t453> <t454>If Monsieur Manette had not died; if one day he had suddenly, quietly disappeared; if the ground had swallowed him up, even if we could guess what terrible place he had gone to, we would not know the way to reach him at all; then, on the other side, if he had an enemy somewhere who possessed a privilege that even the most daring people hesitated to mention; that is to say, these privileged people could fill out some papers and send anyone they wanted to prison and leave them forgotten for as long as they wished; if his wife had begged the king, the queen, the court, the church for news of him, all in vain – then your father's story would be the same as that of this unfortunate gentleman, the doctor from Beauvais.</t454><t455>"</t455>
<t456>"Please, continue telling the story, sir.</t456><t457>"</t457>
<t458>"Alright.</t458> <t459>I will tell.</t459> <t460>But can you handle it?</t460><t461>"</t461>
<t462>"If there's one thing I can't stand, it's this uncertainty.</t462><t463>"</t463>
<t464>"Your voice is calm now, you have calmed down too.</t464> <t465>Good!" (Despite saying this, Mr. Lorry's demeanor showed that he was not very satisfied.</t465><t466>)</t466> <t467>"This is a business matter.</t467> <t468>See this as a business matter – a task that needs to be handled.</t468> <t469>Now, although this doctor's wife is an extremely brave and noble lady, she had suffered such great pains while her little baby was still in her womb...</t469><t470>"</t470>
<t471>"Was this little baby a girl, sir?</t471><t472>"</t472>
<t473>"Yes, she was angry.</t473> <t474>This –this is a matter related to work– don't worry.</t474> <t475>Young lady, this poor woman suffered such great pains when her little baby was still in her womb, that she raised her child telling him that his father was dead so that he wouldn't experience the agony she went through –No, please stand up!</t475> <t476>For God's sake, why are you kneeling?</t476><t477>"</t477>
<t478>"To hear the truth.</t478> <t479>Oh merciful, kind-hearted sir, please tell me the truth now, I beg you!</t479><t480>"</t480>
<t481>"This is a matter of business.</t481> <t482>You are confusing me, and if you confuse me like this, how can I do my work?</t482> <t483>Let's get our heads together first.</t483> <t484>For example, now, try to say how much nine times nine pence is or how many shillings twenty guineas make.</t484> <t485>Then I can be convinced that you are in your right mind.</t485><t486>"</t486>
<t487>The young girl sat calmly in her place without answering the questions, and Mr. Jarvis Lorry felt somewhat relieved because the girl's hands, still clasped to her wrist, were no longer trembling as they had before when the man gently lifted her from her seat.</t487>
<t488>"Ah, like this, now it's perfect.</t488> <t489>Courage! Work! Work comes first; useful work.</t489> <t490>Miss Manette, your mother struggled a lot in her time.</t490> <t491>Until the last moment, she never gave up searching for your father in vain, and when she died – who knows what great sorrows she was in, poor woman – you were two years old, and for all those years, without worrying whether your father was rotting in prisons or had already perished, you grew up as a cheerful and beautiful girl.</t491><t492>"</t492>
<t493>After finishing his sentence, he looked at the girl's long golden hair with a mixture of admiration and compassion; as if he were imagining those hairs with streaks of gray.</t493>
<t494>"You know that your family doesn't have much wealth, and what they do have is already in your and your mother's name.</t494> <t495>There hasn't been any newly discovered money or property or anything; but-"</t495>
<t496>Mr. Lorry felt the girl's hand grasp his wrist even tighter and fell silent.</t496> <t497>The special expression that had previously caught his attention had settled firmly on the girl's forehead, now accompanied by pain and fear.</t497>
<t498>"But – but now he has been found.</t498> <t499>He is alive.</t499> <t500>He must have changed a lot, naturally; he is probably in a ruined state; but let's look at the bright side of things.</t500> <t501>At least he is still alive.</t501> <t502>Your father is now staying in Paris, at the house of an old servant of his, and we are going there.</t502> <t503>I, if I can, to identify him, and you, to give him life, love, responsibility, comfort, and peace again.</t503><t504>"</t504>
<t505>The young girl's body shivered, and so did the man's.</t505> <t506>As if in a dream, the girl spoke in a low, deep, and fearful voice:</t506>
<t507>"So, I will see his ghost!"</t507> <t508>"It really can't be him – It must be his ghost!"</t508><t509>"</t509>
<t510>Mr. Lorry quietly rubbed the girl's hands that were holding his arm.</t510> <t511>"Hold on, hold on!</t511> <t512>Let's see what we'll see, how we'll see it!</t512> <t513>Now you know everything.</t513> <t514>To see your poor father who has been wronged, we will first travel by sea and then by land, and very soon you will be by your dear father's side.</t514><t515>"</t515>
<t516>The young girl continued in the same tone, her voice turning into a whisper, "How free, how happy I was, my father's ghost had never appeared to me!</t516><t517>"</t517>
<t518>To draw the girl's attention to his words, Mr. Lorry emphasized, "There is one more thing," he said, "your father was found under another name; his own name had long been forgotten or hidden.</t518> <t519>Whether he was overlooked in prison all these years or deliberately kept, it is best not to delve too deeply.</t519> <t520>Investigating the reasons for this could be dangerous.</t520> <t521>Let's not discuss this matter anywhere, in any way, and let's get him out of France as soon as possible –by any means necessary–</t521> <t522>We must get him out of France.</t522> <t523>Even though I am safe as an Englishman, and even Tellson, whom the French hold in high regard, avoids talking about this matter.</t523> <t524>I do not carry even the smallest piece of paper related to this matter with me.</t524> <t525>It is a completely confidential matter.</t525> <t526>All my documents, records, and notes are hidden in a single line; "Recalled to Life"; this can mean anything.</t526> <t527>But what happened to you?</t527> <t528>Ah, she doesn't hear me at all!</t528> <t529>Miss Manette?" The young girl had turned to stone, she didn't even slump in her chair, sitting there completely numb under Mr. Lorry's hand; she stared at the man with eyes wide open, as if this final expression was etched or branded on her forehead.</t529> <t530>The young girl held onto his arm so tightly that Mr. Lorry couldn't move for fear of hurting her and called out for help.</t530>
<t531>A strange-looking woman entered with hotel staff behind her; even in his flustered state, Mr. Lorry noticed that the woman was dressed entirely in red, had red hair, and was wearing a peculiar tight outfit with a massive hat on her head that looked like either a soldier's cap or a large wheel of cheese. Mr. Lorry's problem of being unable to move from his spot was resolved when the woman pushed him against the nearest wall with her strong hand.</t531>
<t532>(When Mr. Lorry was pressed against the wall, breathless, he thought to himself, "This must be a man!")</t532><t533></t533>
<t534>This person shouted at the servants, "Hey, why are you staring like that?"</t534> <t535>"Instead of just standing there and staring, go and bring something!</t535> <t536>As if there's something to look at!</t536> <t537>Hurry up!</t537> <t538>Bring me ammonia spirit, cold water, vinegar immediately, or you'll regret it!</t538><t539>"</t539>
<t540>They all scattered around like chicks to bring things to revive the girl, and he laid the young girl on the couch and attended to her with great skill and gentleness.</t540> <t541>He called her "my precious!" and "my bird!" and with great pride and care, he brushed her golden hair back.</t541>
<t542>Turning to Mr. Lorry, he said angrily, "You with the brown coat! Couldn't you have said what you had to say without scaring her so much?</t542> <t543>Look at her, the poor thing's beautiful face has turned completely white, and her hands are ice cold.</t543> <t544>Is this how banking is done?</t544><t545>"</t545>
<t546>Mr. Lorry was so flustered by this difficult question that he could do nothing but look on with a feeble interest and humility. Meanwhile, the strong woman who had dispersed the servants with the threat of showing them "what's what" if they continued to stand around, had gradually calmed the girl and managed to get her to rest her drooping head on her shoulder.</t546>
<t547>"I think he's coming to," said Mr. Lorry.</t547>
<t548>"Not thanks to you but the one in brown.</t548> <t549>Poor little thing!"</t549>
<t550>"I hope," said Mr. Lorry, pausing again with faint interest and humility, "that you will agree to accompany Miss Manette to France?"</t550><t551>"</t551>
<t552>"Look at this!" said the strong woman.</t552> <t553>"If it were my destiny to cross this salty water, would God have placed me on this island?</t553><t554>"</t554>
<t555>The woman had asked another difficult question to answer, and Mr. Jarvis Lorry left them to ponder it.</t555>
<t556>V</t556>
<t557>Wine Shop</t557>
<t558>A large wine barrel had fallen and broken in the street; the barrel had rolled, its hoop had come off, and it lay in front of the wine shop's door, shattered like a walnut shell.</t558>
<t559>Everyone around had left their work or laziness to come to the scene to drink wine.</t559> <t560>The rough and irregular stones of the street, facing different directions, gave the impression that they were designed specifically to cripple every living being passing over them; the spilled wine had formed puddles among the stones, and at the head of each puddle, there was a crowd jostling proportionally to its size.</t560> <t561>Some men were kneeling, using their cupped hands to drink the wine before it could slip through their fingers, either drinking it themselves or helping the women leaning over their shoulders to drink.</t561> <t562>Another group of men and women, with cracked earthenware in their hands, were huddled around the puddles; some women even dipped their headscarves into the wine and squeezed it into their babies' mouths; some were busy making small dams out of mud to prevent the wine from flowing away; some were running back and forth following the words of those watching from the windows above to block the small streams of wine; some, in a state of ecstasy, were licking the soaked barrel pieces, even gnawing on the wooden pieces that had absorbed the wine with great appetite.</t562> <t563>There was no channel for the wine to flow through, and quite a bit of mud was swallowed along with the wine; the place was as clean as if a street sweeper had passed through, so much so that anyone who saw it could believe that this miraculous event had taken place.</t563>
<t564>Throughout this wine game, the street – filled with the voices of men, women, and children – echoed with cheerful laughter and screams.</t564> <t565>There was a bit of roughness and plenty of clowning around involved.</t565> <t566>A completely different sense of camaraderie enveloped everything; they acted with the instinct to move together, and those who were more cheerful and carefree among them were always entwined, drinking to each other's health, shaking hands, and forming circles to dance.</t566> <t567>When the wine ran out and the ponds were replaced by grill-like fingerprint marks, the commotion ended as suddenly as it had begun.</t567> <t568>The man who had left his saw on the wood he was cutting returned to his work; the woman who had left the ash-filled bucket she used to ease the aching hunger of her and her child's fingers outside her door returned to her brazier; the bare-armed, disheveled-haired, pale-faced men who had come out of their cellars into the winter sun went back down again, and a gloom that seemed much more natural than the recent daylight settled over the surroundings.</t568>
<t569>The spilled red wine had painted the narrow street in the suburb of St. Antoine in Paris red.</t569> <t570>Of course, it had also stained many people's hands, faces, bare feet, and wooden clogs.</t570> <t571>Red stains had formed on the handle of the saw of the man cutting wood; the forehead of the woman feeding her baby was stained because of the old cloth she had wrapped around her head again.</t571> <t572>The wine marks were still visible at the corners of the mouths of those bloodthirsty people who had attacked the barrel planks with greed, and a tall fool, whose clothes were filthy and whose nightcap, resembling a dirty sack, was almost falling off his head, had written this on the wall with his finger smeared with mud and wine: BLOOD.</t572>
<t573>The days when this type of wine would flow in the streets and its stain would cover everything were near.</t573>
<t574>Now a huge cloud had covered St. Antoine, and although a light briefly escaped from his holy bulk, the predominant element was a dense darkness – and the cold, filth, disease, ignorance, and hunger that accompanied this saintly being – each was almost a powerful noble; especially the last one.</t574> <t575>Examples of people, ground repeatedly in a mill – and this was certainly not a mill that rejuvenated the old – were shivering at every corner, entering and exiting every door, looking out of every window, fluttering under every garment played by the wind.</t575> <t576>The mill that ground them was a mill that aged the young; the faces of children looked old, and their voices were serious.</t576> <t577>And on these adult faces, in every line progressing like the mark of a plow, the same thing was seen, Hunger.</t577> <t578>Hunger was everywhere.</t578> <t579>It hung from the miserable clothes thrown out of high buildings, lined up in rows; Hunger was patched into these with straw, rags, wood splinters, and paper; it showed itself in every piece of wood the man cut with his saw.</t579> <t580>Hunger stared out from the chimneys that did not smoke, stood tall in the filthy street where there wasn't a single crumb of food in the garbage.</t580> <t581>Hunger was an inscription on the shelves of the bakeries, written over the few remaining dry loaves of bread; it was in the shop where sausages made from rotten meat were sold.</t581> <t582>Hunger rattled its dry bones among the chestnuts cooking in the cylindrical stove; it spread over every slice of potato frying with a few reluctant drops of oil.</t582>
<t583>The never-ending presence of hunger had permeated everywhere and everything.</t583> <t584>A narrow, winding street where all kinds of faults and filth brewed, intersected by other narrow and winding streets, people wearing tattered clothes and nightcaps on their heads, smelling just like those tattered clothes and caps, and a morbid gloom in everything visible.</t584> <t585>Even in their disheveled state, people carried a terrifying hope within them to escape from the corner they were trapped in.</t585> <t586>Though they were overwhelmed and weary, flames were shooting from the eyes of some; their lips were tightly shut, turning white from the things they couldn't say; their furrowed brows had turned into the noose they thought would either be placed on their heads or on the heads of others.</t586> <t587>The pictures on all the signs (which were almost as numerous as the shops) depicted Hunger.</t587> <t588>The butcher and the pork seller had hung pictures of the scrawniest cuts of meat, while the baker had pictures of the stalest loaves.</t588> <t589>The coarse demeanor of people drinking in the wine shops was also depicted, with men conversing with sullen faces over the small amounts of diluted wine and beer in their glasses.</t589> <t590>Aside from tools and weapons, nothing was depicted in its entirety; the knives and axes of the cutler were sharp and shiny, the hammers of the blacksmith were heavy, and the goods of the armorer were lethal.</t590> <t591>The small puddles of mud and water and the loose cobblestones led nowhere, abruptly ending at doorsteps.</t591> <t592>In contrast, the open sewage channels flowed through the middle of the street – if they flowed at all – which only happened after heavy rain, finding various ways to seep into the houses.</t592> <t593>Along the streets, at wide intervals, there were shaky lanterns hanging from a rope and pulley; at night, when the lamplighter lowered and lit them before pulling them back up, they would sway above like a faint ember from the dim wicks, as if they were floating on the sea.</t593> <t594>Indeed, they were at sea, and the ship and its crew were facing the danger of a storm.</t594>
<t595>The ragged-looking scrawny ones on the boulevard, with their idle and hungry states, would regret not following the lamplighter; yet, if they could comprehend and develop the man's method, when the time came, they could illuminate the darkness they were in by hanging people at the ends of these ropes and pulleys.</t595> <t596>But the time had not yet come, and while the winds blowing over France were pointlessly fluttering the clothes of these ragged-looking ones, the chirping beautiful feathered birds were indifferent to everything.</t596>
<t597>The wine shop was on the corner, better than many other shops both in appearance and quality, and the owner of the shop, wearing a yellow vest and green pants, was standing in front of the door, looking at the mess caused by the spilled wine.</t597> <t598>He shrugged his shoulders sharply, "It's none of my business," he said.</t598> <t599>"The market vendors knocked it over.</t599> <t600>Let them bring another one.</t600><t601>"</t601>
<t602>At that moment, his eye caught the tall jester who was busy writing his piece, and he called out from across the street:</t602>
<t603>"Hey Gaspard, what are you doing there?"</t603><t604>"</t604>
<t605>Adam, thinking he was a joker, pointed to what he had written as if it were something immensely important.</t605> <t606>But, in a manner befitting clowns like himself, he missed the mark and failed miserably.</t606>
<t607>As the owner of the wine shop was crossing the street, he said, "What are you doing, man?</t607> <t608>Are you out of your mind?" and to erase the man's mischief, he took a handful of mud from the ground and smeared it over the writing.</t608> <t609>"Why are you writing on public places?</t609> <t610>Tell me – couldn't you find another place to write this?</t610><t611>"</t611>
<t612>While scolding the man, he had placed his relatively clean hand (perhaps accidentally, perhaps not) on the jester's heart.</t612> <t613>The jester lightly slapped this hand, jumped with an agile movement, and landed with a magnificent dance move, holding one of his stained shoes that had flown off his foot.</t613> <t614>In that state, he looked like an extremely skillful individual.</t614>
<t615>"Wear it, come on, wear it quickly," said the other.</t615> <t616>"Give the wine its due and finish it."</t616> <t617>Upon this advice, the man wiped his dirty hand on the jester –as if to say it got dirty because of him, looking him straight in the eye– and then crossed back over and entered the wine shop.</t617>
<t618>The owner of the wine shop was a man in his thirties, with a thick neck and a bold appearance, and judging by the fact that he had thrown his coat over his shoulder despite the harsh weather, he seemed to have a rather warm disposition.</t618> <t619>The sleeves of his shirt were rolled up, revealing his tanned arms up to the elbows.</t619> <t620>There was nothing covering his head except for his short, curly, dark hair.</t620> <t621>He was a handsome man with beautiful eyes and a tanned complexion, with a pleasant gap between them.</t621> <t622>He generally seemed to be a good-natured person, but he could also be ruthless; clearly, he was a determined, resolute man, and it was better not to cross paths with him.</t622> <t623>Even if he had to pass through a narrow passage with cliffs on both sides, he would not turn back from his path.</t623>
<t624>When the man walked into the shop, Madam Defarge – that is, his wife – was sitting behind the counter.</t624> <t625>Madam Defarge was a stout woman of her husband's age, with alert eyes that seemed to look at nothing, a large hand full of rings, a face with strong, sturdy features, and a calm demeanor.</t625> <t626>She had an air about her that gave the impression she never made a mistake in any calculation she undertook.</t626> <t627>Since Madam Defarge was sensitive to the cold, she was wrapped in furs and had tied a brightly colored scarf around her head, but her large earrings were still visible.</t627> <t628>She had set aside her knitting to pick her teeth with a toothpick.</t628> <t629>Since she was busy supporting her right elbow with her left hand, she didn't say anything when her husband arrived, merely contenting herself with a slight cough.</t629> <t630>Accompanied by this cough, the way she raised her dark eyebrows, which were like thin lines, was a gesture indicating that there had been customers while her husband was outside and that it would be good for him to attend to them.</t630>
<t631>Upon this, the wine seller's eyes wandered around until they caught sight of the elderly gentleman and the young lady sitting in a corner.</t631> <t632>The others were still there: two people playing cards, two people playing dominoes, and three men leaning against the counter, sipping their small amounts of wine little by little.</t632> <t633>When the wine seller went behind the counter, the elderly gentleman signaled to the young lady with his eyes and said, "This is the man we've been waiting for."</t633>
<t634>Monsieur Defarge muttered to himself, "What is this man saying? I don't even know him.</t634><t635>"</t635>
<t636>He pretended not to notice these two strangers and engaged in conversation with the three customers drinking in front of the counter.</t636>
<t637>"So how's it going, Jacques?" one of them said to Monsieur Defarge.</t637> <t638>"Did they clean up the spilled wine?</t638><t639>"</t639>
<t640>"To the very last drop, Jacques," said Monsieur Defarge.</t640>
<t641>While they were talking to each other, addressing each other by the same name, Madam Defarge, who was still picking her teeth with a toothpick, lightly coughed again and raised her eyebrows, forming a thin line, once more.</t641>
<t642>"Generally," said the Second of the three men to Monsieur Defarge, "these wretched creatures do not know the taste of wine; what they know is a dark bread, and death.</t642> <t643>Isn't that right, Jacques?</t643><t644>"</t644>
<t645>"Right, Jacques," replied Monsieur Defarge.</t645>
<t646>While they addressed each other by the same name for the second time, Madam Defarge, who was still picking her teeth with a toothpick in great tranquility, coughed lightly once more and raised her eyebrows, forming a thin line, once again.</t646>
<t647>This time, after the last of the three men put down his emptied glass and smacked his lips, he started to speak.</t647>
<t648>"Ah! Very bad, very!"</t648> <t649>"The poor always have a bitter taste in their mouths, Jacques, and their lives are even worse."</t649> <t650>"Am I wrong, Jacques?"</t650>
<t651>"You are right, Jacques," replied Monsieur Defarge.</t651>
<t652>When the men addressed each other by the same name for the third time, Madam Defarge had also put her toothpick aside, raised her eyebrows even higher, and shifted slightly in her seat.</t652>
<t653>"That's right, indeed!</t653> <t654>You're right!" grumbled her husband.</t654> <t655>"Gentlemen...</t655> <t656>this is my wife!"</t656>
<t657>Three customers took off their hats and greeted Madam Defarge with a showy gesture.</t657> <t658>She also slightly bowed her head in response to their greetings and gave them a once-over.</t658> <t659>Then, glancing around the wine shop, she picked up her knitting with tremendous calm and tranquility and immersed herself in her work.</t659>
<t660>With his bright eyes still obediently on his wife, the wine merchant said, "Gentlemen, the bachelor room you asked about and wanted to see is on the fifth floor as I was heading out.</t660> <t661>You can reach the courtyard immediately to the left of the stairs," he indicated with his hand, "from beside that window.</t661> <t662>But now I remember that one of you has been there before, let him show you the way.</t662> <t663>Come on, gentlemen, adieu!"</t663>
<t664>The men paid for their wine and left.</t664> <t665>While Monsieur Defarge's eyes were on his wife who was knitting, the elderly gentleman got up from his corner, approached, and said he wanted to talk to him.</t665>
<t666>"With pleasure, sir," said Monsieur Defarge, and they quietly proceeded towards the door.</t666>
<t667>The conversation was very short but quite heated.</t667> <t668>From the very first word, Monsieur Defarge listened to him intently.</t668> <t669>Not even a minute had passed when he nodded and went outside.</t669> <t670>Madame Defarge continued knitting without moving her eyebrows, her fingers moving rapidly, and she saw nothing else.</t670>
<t671>Mr. Jarvis Lorry and Miss Manette left the wine shop and went to Monsieur Defarge, to the entrance where the man had just described the room to the men.</t671> <t672>This led to a small, dark courtyard that smelled terrible and was used as a passage to an area with a bunch of houses and a lot of people living there.</t672> <t673>In this gloomy, tiled entrance that opened onto gloomy, tiled stairs, Monsieur Defarge knelt before his former employer's daughter and brought her hand to his lips.</t673> <t674>Although it was a polite gesture, it was not done in an overly polite manner; within a few seconds, the man's entire demeanor had changed.</t674> <t675>The cheerful, clear-faced man was gone, replaced by a mysterious, angry, and dangerous man.</t675>
<t676>Mr. Defarge warned Mr. Lorry at the top of the stairs with a firm attitude.</t676> <t677>"It's quite high up; you might find it difficult.</t677> <t678>Take it slow.</t678><t679>"</t679>
<t680>The other whispered, "Alone?"</t680><t681>"</t681>
<t682>"Alone! May God help him, who else would be with him anyway?" said the other in the same low voice.</t682>
<t683>"Always only then.</t683><t684>"</t684>
<t685>"Yes.</t685><t686>"</t686>
<t687>"Does he want it that way himself?</t687><t688>"</t688>
<t689>"That's how it needs to be.</t689> <t690>Even then, I mean the day they found me, asked me to take him with me, and told me to keep my mouth shut – even then, when I first saw him, he was alone, and he is still alone now.</t690><t691>"</t691>
<t692>"Has he/she changed a lot?</t692><t693>"</t693>
<t694>"Of course it has changed!</t694><t695>"</t695>
<t696>The owner of the wine shop paused to punch the wall and let out a hefty curse.</t696> <t697>No response could be half as effective as what he did.</t697> <t698>As he climbed the stairs with the others, Mr. Lorry felt more and more anxious with each step.</t698>
<t699>In the relatively older and more crowded areas of Paris, it would be natural for such a staircase to look bad with all its details, but that day, for these genteel individuals who knew nothing of misery, this place was utterly disgusting.</t699> <t700>The inhabitants of every small dwelling in this high filth nest of a building –in other words, every room or rooms opening onto the staircase– had piled all their rubbish onto their own landing and thrown the rest out of the windows.</t700> <t701>This out-of-control heap of hopeless trash had covered everything so much that even if the invisible filth of poverty and deprivation had not been added to it, it would have been enough to pollute the air; the combination of these two was truly unbearable.</t701> <t702>But to continue on their way, they had to breathe this air, dive into this steep, dark pit of filth and poison.</t702> <t703>Mr. Jarvis Lorry, unable to bear his increasing anxieties and the excitement of his young companion, stopped and rested twice.</t703> <t704>Each of these pauses was taken in front of sorrowful window grilles where a piece of clean, beautiful, and melancholy air had flown away, replaced by a foul vapor.</t704> <t705>Instead of the views of that chaotic neighborhood, the air was noticeable through the rusty bars, and as far as could be seen, there was no sign of healthy living or hope anywhere near or below the tops of Notre-Dame's two great towers.</t705>
<t706>Finally, they reached the last step and stopped for the third time.</t706> <t707>However, before reaching the attic, a steeper and narrower staircase stretched out before them.</t707> <t708>As if afraid that the young lady might ask a question, the owner of the wine shop, who had been walking slightly ahead and on Mr. Lorry's side since the beginning of the stairs, turned around here and carefully searched the pockets of the coat he was carrying on his shoulder, producing a key.</t708>
<t709>"Is the door locked, my friend?" said Mr. Lorry, in a surprised manner.</t709>
<t710>Monsieur Defarge said, "Yes, indeed," with a serious demeanor.</t710>
<t711>"Is it necessary to keep the unfortunate man locked up like this?</t711><t712>"</t712>
<t713>"I think it's worth turning the key." Monsieur Defarge had whispered this into Mr. Lorry's ear, his eyebrows furrowed sternly.</t713>
<t714>"Why?"</t714>
<t715>"Why, you ask?</t715> <t716>The poor man lived locked up for so long that if we were to leave this door open, he would be scared – go mad – tear himself apart – die – who knows what he might do.</t716><t717>"</t717>
<t718>"Is such a thing possible?" shouted Mr. Lorry.</t718>
<t719>Defarge sternly repeated, "Is such a thing possible?"</t719> <t720>"Of course.</t720> <t721>In this beautiful world we live in, such a thing is possible, many other things are possible too, and not only possible but such things really happen every day under this sky – they truly happen!</t721> <t722>The devil enters a person's mind.</t722> <t723>Anyway, let's get back to our work.</t723><t724>"</t724>
<t725>They had spoken so quietly that the young girl did not hear a single word of it.</t725> <t726>But when they reached the door, she was trembling intensely under the influence of such a strong emotion – and there was such deep concern, moreover, fear and anxiety on her face that Mr. Lorry felt the need to say a few words to comfort her.</t726>
<t727>"Be strong, young lady!</t727> <t728>Be strong for a bit!</t728> <t729>Let's get our work done!</t729> <t730>The hardest part of the job will be over in a minute; once you pass through this door, the hardest part will be over.</t730> <t731>After that, it's all good, you'll give her kindness, peace, and happiness.</t731> <t732>Now let this kind-hearted brother of ours take your other arm.</t732> <t733>Ah, that's good, Brother Defarge.</t733> <t734>Alright now.</t734> <t735>Let's continue with our work!</t735><t736>"</t736>
<t737>They climbed the stairs slowly and silently.</t737> <t738>There weren't many steps, and soon they were at the top.</t738> <t739>There, as soon as they turned the corner, they unexpectedly found three men right in front of them, leaning against the side of the door, peering excitedly through various cracks and holes in the wall into the room where the door was open.</t739> <t740>Upon hearing the approaching footsteps, all three immediately straightened up and turned around, revealing that they were the trio with the same names who were drinking in the wine shop.</t740>
<t741>"I had forgotten these due to the surprise of your visit," explained Monsieur Defarge.</t741> <t742>"Come on, you children go; we have work to do here.</t742><t743>"</t743>
<t744>The three of them slipped past and quietly went down.</t744> <t745>Since there was no other door on the floor and the owner of the wine shop headed straight for this door when they were alone, Mr. Lorry whispered with a slightly angry demeanor:</t745>
<t746>"Did you make Monsieur Manette into a showpiece?"</t746><t747>"</t747>
<t748>"I show it, as I am showing you right now, only to a select few."</t748><t749>"</t749>
<t750>"Is this a good thing?</t750><t751>"</t751>
<t752>"I think it's good.</t752><t753>"</t753>
<t754>"Who are these chosen people?"</t754> <t755>"According to what criteria do you choose them?"</t755><t756>"</t756>
<t757>"I choose men who have the same name as mine – by the way, my name is Jacques – and who are presentable.</t757> <t758>Anyway, that's enough; you are English; that's a different matter.</t758> <t759>Please wait here for a moment.</t759><t760>"</t760>
<t761>Defarge, with a cautionary demeanor, signaled with his hand for them to stay back and bent down to look through the crack in the wall.</t761> <t762>Straightening up shortly after, he knocked on the door two or three times – clearly intending to make noise.</t762> <t763>With the same intention, he also struggled three or four times to insert the key into the lock – barely managing to fit it in – and turned it as slowly as possible.</t763>
<t764>The door slowly opened inward, Defarge glanced into the room and said something.</t764> <t765>A feeble voice responded.</t765> <t766>Both sides uttered a single monosyllabic word.</t766>
<t767>Defarge signaled them to enter by looking over his shoulder.</t767> <t768>Mr. Lorry extended his arm around the young girl's waist and held her tightly; because she seemed about to faint.</t768>
<t769>"This, this is just a job, just a job!" he insisted, but the wetness glistening on his cheek said otherwise.</t769> <t770>"Come inside, come on!</t770><t771>"</t771>
<t772>"I'm scared," said the girl, trembling.</t772>
<t773>"Why are you afraid?</t773><t774>"</t774>
<t775>"I am afraid of him.</t775> <t776>Of my father.</t776><t777>"</t777>
<t778>On one hand, the girl's condition, and on the other, the hurried signals from his guides, left Mr. Lorry helpless. He took the trembling arm over his shoulder and lifted the girl slightly into the room.</t778> <t779>As soon as they entered through the door, he put down the girl who was clinging tightly to him and held her.</t779>
<t780>Defarge took out the key, closed the door, locked it from the inside, and held the key in his hand after removing it again.</t780> <t781>He did all of this in a very systematic manner, making the loudest and harshest noises possible.</t781> <t782>Finally, he walked heavily towards the place where the window was.</t782> <t783>He stopped there and turned his face.</t783> <t784>The attic, which was made to store wood and similar things, had a rather dim and mysterious appearance; the skylight was actually a door opening to the roof and had a small pulley mechanism used to get things from the shops below; it was unpolished and, like all other doors in French buildings, it was double-winged.</t784> <t785>To block the cold, one wing of the door was tightly closed, while the other was left slightly ajar.</t785> <t786>In this way, so little light came in that it was difficult to see anything upon first entering, and to do any work requiring descending in such darkness, one had to be doing it for a long time.</t786> <t787>However, the very work being done in the attic was just like this; the person, with his back to the door and his face turned towards the window where the owner of the wine shop stood watching him, was an old man with white hair, sitting on a low stool, hunched over, making shoes with all his might.</t787>
<t788>VI</t788>
<t789>Shoemaker</t789>
<t790>Monsieur Defarge, bending over the shoe in his hand, said to the white-haired man working, "Good day!"</t790>
<t791>The white-haired head lifted for a moment and responded to the greeting with a feeble voice, as if the sound was coming from a great distance:</t791>
<t792>"Good day!"</t792>
<t793>"I see you're still working hard.</t793><t794>"</t794>
<t795>After a long silence, the head lifted again and responded, "Yes – I am working."</t795><t796>"</t796> <t797>This time, before his head fell forward again, he looked at the man asking the questions with a pair of weary eyes.</t797>
<t798>The frailty of the voice evoked both pity and suspicion within a person.</t798> <t799>It did not contain a physical weakness, but undoubtedly the impact of being imprisoned and enduring harsh conditions was significant.</t799> <t800>The pitiful state of the voice stemmed from loneliness and not being used for a long time.</t800> <t801>It was as if it were the last faint echo of a voice that had sounded long ago.</t801> <t802>It was so far removed from the liveliness and resonance of a human voice that it gave the impression of a once beautiful color having turned into a pale stain.</t802> <t803>This voice was so deep and suppressed that it seemed to come from underground.</t803> <t804>It was so affecting that only a hopeless and lost creature, a traveler exhausted from wandering alone in the desert, on the brink of death from hunger, could produce such a voice while reminiscing about its home and friends before lying down to die.</t804>
<t805>Adam worked quietly for a while longer, then his weary eyes looked up again; it wasn't interest or curiosity, but a soulless realization, the spot where his visitor had stood a moment ago was still not empty.</t805>
<t806>"I say," said Defarge, without taking his eyes off the shoemaker, "it would be good if a little more daylight came in."</t806> <t807>Can you bear it?</t807><t808>"</t808>
<t809>The shoemaker stopped his work; with a distracted demeanor, he looked to his right, then to his left, and finally at the man speaking above him.</t809>
<t810>"What did you say?</t810><t811>"</t811>
<t812>"Can you endure a bit more light?</t812><t813>"</t813>
<t814>"If I have to endure, I will endure."</t814> <t815>(There was a faint hint of emphasis on the second word.</t815><t816>)</t816>
<t817>The half-open wing opened a bit more and was fixed at a certain angle.</t817> <t818>With a broad beam of light entering the attic, the craftsman who had paused his work and was sitting with an unfinished shoe in his lap came into view.</t818> <t819>At his feet and on his workbench were a few tools and various pieces of leather.</t819> <t820>He had a short, patchy white beard, a sunken face, and bright, sparkling eyes.</t820> <t821>His face was so sunken and thin that even if his eyes, peering out from under his dark eyebrows and tangled hair, were small, they would certainly appear large; but his eyes were naturally large and did not look natural at all.</t821> <t822>His withered old skin was visible through the open collar of his shabby yellow shirt.</t822> <t823>Both the man himself, his sack-like work clothes, his loose socks, in short, all those rags he wore had not seen light or air for so long that they had all taken on a lifeless pale yellow like parchment paper, making it hard to distinguish one from the other.</t823>
<t824>He put his hand in front of his eyes to block the light, his bones were so visible that it gave the impression of being transparent.</t824> <t825>The man, with fixed eyes, paused his work and sat like that for a while.</t825> <t826>Before looking at the person standing in front of him, he would always look to the right and then to the left; it was as if he had lost the habit of connecting sound with place; he never spoke without looking around like that, and then he would forget what he was going to say.</t826>
<t827>Defarge, while signaling Mr. Lorry to come with his hand, asked the man, "Will you finish those shoes today?"</t827>
<t828>"What did you say?</t828><t829>"</t829>
<t830>"Do you absolutely have to finish those shoes today?</t830><t831>"</t831>
<t832>"It doesn't necessarily have to end.</t832> <t833>I think... I don't know.</t833><t834>"</t834>
<t835>But this question reminded him of the work he had left aside, and he bent over the task in front of him again.</t835>
<t836>Mr. Lorry left the young girl by the door and quietly advanced towards them.</t836> <t837>As he stood by Defarge for a minute or two, the shoemaker looked up.</t837> <t838>He did not seem at all surprised to see a second person, but at that moment the trembling fingers of one hand found his lips (both his lips and nails were the same pale lead color), then his hand returned to his work and once again bent over the shoe.</t838> <t839>This glance and manner were very fleeting.</t839>
<t840>"You have a visitor," said Monsieur Defarge.</t840>
<t841>"What did you say?</t841><t842>"</t842>
<t843>"You have a visitor."</t843><t844>"</t844>
<t845>The shoemaker looked up just like before, but this time he didn't stop what he was doing.</t845>
<t846>"Look!" said Defarge.</t846> <t847>"There is a gentleman here who understands good shoes.</t847> <t848>Show him the shoe you made.</t848> <t849>Look, Monsieur.</t849><t850>"</t850>
<t851>Mr. Lorry took the shoe in his hand.</t851>
<t852>"Tell the gentleman what type of shoe this is and the name of the maker."</t852><t853>"</t853>
<t854>There was a longer silence than before, then the shoemaker replied:</t854>
<t855>"I forgot what you asked.</t855> <t856>What did you say?</t856><t857>"</t857>
<t858>"I had said, could you tell what type of shoe this is for the gentleman?</t858><t859>"</t859>
<t860>"This is a woman's shoe.</t860> <t861>A walking shoe for a young lady.</t861> <t862>Latest fashion.</t862> <t863>I don't know fashion.</t863> <t864>But I had a model in my hand.</t864><t865>"</t865>
<t866>"I wonder what the name of the person who did it is?" said Defarge.</t866>
<t867>Since the shoemaker's hands were idle, he first placed his right hand in his left palm, then his left hand in his right palm, then ran his hand over his bearded chin, and continued to do this at regular intervals without any pause.</t867> <t868>When he spoke, it was like trying to bring a very weak person to consciousness or trying to preserve the soul of a dying man with a glimmer of hope.</t868>
<t869>"Did you ask my name?</t869><t870>"</t870>
<t871>"Yes, I asked for his name."</t871><t872>"</t872>
<t873>"One Hundred Five, North Tower."</t873><t874>"</t874>
<t875>"Is that all?"</t875><t876>"</t876>
<t877>"One Hundred Five, North Tower."</t877><t878>"</t878>
<t879>He bent over his work again, emitting a tired sound that resembled neither a sigh nor a moan, until the silence was broken.</t879>
<t880>"Actually, you are not a shoemaker, are you?" said Mr. Lorry, without taking his eyes off him.</t880>
<t881>The man's weary eyes turned to Defarge as if to transfer the question to him; but when no help came from that side, he looked around and then turned to the one who asked the question.</t881>
<t882>"Actually, am I not a shoemaker?</t882> <t883>No, I wasn't actually a shoemaker.</t883> <t884>I... I learned this here.</t884> <t885>By myself.</t885> <t886>I asked for permission for the thing-"</t886>
<t887>There he hesitated, for minutes, repeating the same routine movements with his hands again.</t887> <t888>Then his eyes finally, slowly, turned back to the face they had left earlier, and as they focused on it, the shoemaker continued from where he had left off, with the demeanor of someone who had just woken up and returned to a topic discussed the previous night.</t888>
<t889>"I asked for permission to learn on my own for something, and after they made me struggle for a long time, they gave it to me. Since then, I have been making shoes.</t889><t890>"</t890>
<t891>When the shoemaker reached for the shoe taken from his hand, Mr. Lorry, his eyes still persistently on the man, said:</t891>
<t892>"Monsieur Manette, don't you remember me at all?" The shoe fell to the ground and the shoemaker fixed his eyes on the man asking the questions.</t892>
<t893>"Monsieur Manette," said Mr. Lorry, placing his hand on Defarge's arm; "do you not remember this man?</t893> <t894>Take a look at him.</t894> <t895>Look at me.</t895> <t896>Do the old banker, your old job, your old servant, the old times not come to mind, Monsieur Manette?"</t896>
<t897>The man who had been imprisoned for years sat down and stared alternately at Mr. Lorry and Defarge, the traces of intelligence that had almost faded from the center of his forehead slowly dispersing the dark fog that had settled over him.</t897> <t898>Then his mind clouded again, becoming vague and completely disappearing; but for a while, they were there.</t898> <t899>The expression on the beautiful face of the young girl who had slowly moved to a point from where she could see him from the wall and was now watching him from where she stood was the same; at first, she brought her hands to her face out of a mixture of fear and compassion, not to prevent herself from seeing him, but now her hands were reaching out to him, trembling with the excitement of pressing his ghost-like face to her warm chest and giving him life and hope again – the expression on the girl's beautiful, young face was so identical to the man's (but the girl's expression was stronger) that it gave the impression that a moving light had passed from the man to the girl.</t899>
<t900>A darkness had fallen over the man again.</t900> <t901>He looked at the two men with much less attention than before, and his eyes found their place again in that dim reverie, and just like before, he looked to the right and to the left.</t901> <t902>Finally, with a long and deep sigh, he picked up the shoe from the ground and continued his work.</t902>
<t903>"Do you remember him, monsieur?" asked Defarge in a whisper.</t903>
<t904>"Yes; for a moment.</t904> <t905>At first, I had no hope at all, but then suddenly, that face I once knew so well came to life in my mind.</t905> <t906>Shh! Anyway, let's step back a bit.</t906> <t907>Slowly!</t907><t908>"</t908>
<t909>The young girl had moved away from the wall of the attic and had approached the bench where the man was sitting.</t909> <t910>The shoemaker was so engrossed in his work that it was a grave situation that he was unaware of a hand that could reach out and touch him at any moment.</t910>
<t911>There wasn't a sound.</t911> <t912>The girl stood next to the man like a ghost for a while, and the man continued to bend over his work.</t912>
<t913>At one point, he had to put down the tool in his hand and pick up the utility knife.</t913> <t914>The utility knife was on the ground, on the opposite side of where the girl was standing.</t914> <t915>The shoemaker had just picked it up from the ground and was about to bend over his work again when his eyes caught the hem of the girl's dress.</t915> <t916>When he lifted his head, he met her face.</t916> <t917>The two men watching them seemed about to step forward, but the young girl signaled them to stop with her hand.</t917> <t918>The girl was never afraid that the shoemaker would attack her with the knife, but the others were afraid of this.</t918>
<t919>The shoemaker looked at the girl with fear-filled eyes, and soon his lips began to move, but no meaningful sound was coming out yet.</t919> <t920>Then, amidst his hurried and weary breaths, something came out of his mouth in broken fragments:</t920>
<t921>"Who is this?</t921><t922>"</t922>
<t923>As tears streamed down her cheeks, the girl brought her hands to her lips and sent a kiss to the man; then, as if she were resting his devastated head on her chest, she clasped her hands over her chest.</t923>
<t924>"Are you the jailer's daughter?</t924><t925>"</t925>
<t926>The young girl sighed and said, "No."</t926>
<t927>The girl was too excited to speak, she sat quietly next to the man.</t927> <t928>The shoemaker seemed to move aside, but the girl placed her hand on his arm.</t928> <t929>As a result, the man's body shivered with a strange excitement; he put the knife aside and fixed his eyes on the girl.</t929>
<t930>The girl's long, curly golden hair was hastily tossed to the side, cascading down her neck.</t930> <t931>The man slowly reached out his hand, took hold of the girl's hair, and examined it.</t931> <t932>But at that moment, his mind became confused, and with a deep sigh, he bent over the shoe again.</t932>
<t933>It didn't take too long.</t933> <t934>The girl removed her hand from the man's arm and placed it on his shoulder.</t934> <t935>The shoemaker, after turning around a few times and looking suspiciously at the girl's hand as if to make sure she was still there, set the shoe aside, brought his hand to his collar, and pulled out a tarnished string with a folded piece of cloth tied to the end.</t935> <t936>He carefully opened it on his knees; inside, there was a very small amount of hair, a few strands of long golden hair that he used to wrap around his finger in the old days.</t936>
<t937>Then he held the girl's hair again and looked at it carefully.</t937> <t938>"The same."</t938> <t939>How could it be!</t939> <t940>When was it!</t940> <t941>How did it happen!</t941><t942>"</t942>
<t943>The entire intensity of his expression had shifted to the man's forehead, and he noticed that the same expression was on the girl as well.</t943> <t944>He turned her towards the light and looked again.</t944>
<t945>"She had rested her head on my shoulder, it was the evening I was summoned – she was afraid I would leave, but I was not afraid at all – and when I was taken to the North Tower, they found these on me.</t945> <t946>'Would you leave these with me?</t946> <t947>They won't help me escape from here, but they will be good for my soul.'</t947> <t948>That's what I told them.</t948> <t949>I remember it very well.</t949><t950>"</t950>
<t951>His lips had done quite a bit of preparation to be able to utter these words.</t951> <t952>But as they slowly spilled from his mouth, they were quite coherent.</t952>
<t953>"How did this happen?</t953> <t954>Was it you?"</t954>
<t955>As the shoemaker turned towards the girl, the two men once again rushed forward in a panic.</t955> <t956>But the young girl, with the man's eyes still on her, continued to sit calmly and said in a low voice, "Please, gentlemen, do not approach, do not say anything, do not move from your place!"</t956>
<t957>"Stop!" the man shouted.</t957> <t958>"Whose voice was that?</t958><t959>"</t959>
<t960>With this outcry, he removed his hands from the girl and brought them to his disheveled white hair.</t960> <t961>He had lost her, he had lost everything except his shoemaking skills; he folded his small package again and tucked it safely into his bosom; but his eyes were still on the young girl and he shook his head pensively.</t961>
<t962>"No, no; you are very young, very fresh.</t962> <t963>You cannot be her.</t963> <t964>Look at this prisoner.</t964> <t965>These are not the hands he knows, this is not the face he knows, this is a voice he has never heard.</t965> <t966>That woman, that man – before all those years in the North Tower – they are long gone.</t966> <t967>What is your name, beautiful angel?</t967><t968>"</t968>
<t969>Upon the softening of the man's tone and demeanor, the young girl knelt down and placed her beautiful hands on her father's chest:</t969>
<t970>"Ah sir, another time you will learn the names of my mother, my father, and myself, and how it is that I never knew their difficult story.</t970> <t971>But now, especially here, I cannot tell you.</t971> <t972>The only thing I can tell you here and now is, I beg you, hold me, bless me.</t972> <t973>Kiss me, kiss me please!</t973> <t974>For heaven's sake!</t974><t975>"</t975>
<t976>The man's cold white head mingled with the girl's radiant hair, which shone like the "light of freedom" and both warmed and illuminated her.</t976>
<t977>"If you have likened my voice to the one that once caressed your ear – I don't know if it is so, but I hope it is – let your tears flow!</t977> <t978>If touching my hair reminded you of the beloved head you rested against your chest in your youthful and free days, let your tears flow!</t978> <t979>If when I spoke to you about a Home where I could serve you with all my respect and reverence, it reminded you of a Home that dissolved in the old days while your poor heart melted away, let your tears flow!</t979><t980>"</t980>
<t981>The young girl grabbed the shoemaker by the neck, pressed him against her chest, and rocked him like a child.</t981>
<t982>"If, when I tell you that your suffering has ended, that I have come here to put an end to it, that we will go to England and live in peace and comfort, it reminds you of how your life has been wasted and the terrible things that have happened to you in our homeland France, let your tears flow!</t982> <t983>When I tell you my name, the name of my living father and my deceased mother, moreover, when you learn that I had to kneel before my honorable father and beg him to forgive me because my poor mother hid the bitter truth about my father from me solely out of her love for me, and therefore I could not cry for her day and night, let your tears flow!</t983> <t984>Let your tears flow both for him and for me!</t984> <t985>Ah, dear gentlemen, thank God!</t985> <t986>I feel his sacred tears on my face, his sobs in my heart.</t986> <t987>Ah! Thank God, thank you, my God!</t987><t988>"</t988>
<t989>The man was deeply buried in the girl's arms, his face fallen onto her chest; it was such a scene, both poignant and containing the great mistake and pain that had been made, that the two men covered their faces with their hands.</t989>
<t990>As the silence of the attic prolonged and the man's swelling heart and trembling body calmed down, like the silence that settles after every storm – this was a symbol of humanity showing that the storm called life eventually calms down, ending in peace and quiet – the men rushed forward to lift the father and daughter from the ground.</t990> <t991>The shoemaker had slowly collapsed and now lay on the ground in an exhausted state, as if numb.</t991> <t992>His daughter had also collapsed to the ground with him and had taken her head into her arms; her hair completely blocked the light falling on the man.</t992>
<t993>As Mr. Lorry leaned over them, sniffing repeatedly, the young girl raised her hand and said, "If we can arrange to get him out of Paris without disturbing him, that is, from the doorstep...</t993><t994>"</t994>
<t995>"But wait.</t995> <t996>Is your father suitable for this journey?" asked Mr. Lorry.</t996>
<t997>"I think it would be much more appropriate for him to stay here, this place is too terrifying for him.</t997><t998>"</t998>
<t999>Defarge, bending down to hear better, said, "Right."</t999> <t1000>"In any case, leaving France will be good for Monsieur Manette in many ways.</t1000> <t1001>What do you think, should I arrange horses with a stagecoach?</t1001><t1002>"</t1002>
<t1003>"This is a job in itself," said Mr. Lorry, summarizing the matter in his usual straightforward manner, "and if a job is to be done, I must be the one to do it."</t1003><t1004>"</t1004>
<t1005>"Then, if I may ask," said Miss Manette, "could you leave us alone now?</t1005> <t1006>Look how much calmer he is, there's no need for you to be afraid to leave us alone.</t1006> <t1007>What could possibly happen?</t1007> <t1008>If you lock us in to ensure we are not disturbed, I'm sure you'll find him as quiet as you left him when you return.</t1008> <t1009>In any case, I will watch over him until you return, and then we will take him directly to the stable.</t1009><t1010>"</t1010>
<t1011>Neither Mr. Lorry nor Defarge were willing to leave them alone, and they thought it would be good for one of them to stay.</t1011> <t1012>However, not only the carriage and horses needed to be arranged, but also the travel documents; moreover, time was running out, the day was ending, so they hurriedly divided the tasks and left.</t1012>
<t1013>Then, when darkness fell, the girl rested her head on the hard ground by her father's side and watched him.</t1013> <t1014>The darkness grew and grew, and until a light filtered through the cracks in the wall, father and daughter lay there silently.</t1014>
<t1015>Mr. Lorry and Monsieur Defarge had made all the preparations for the journey; besides things like cloaks and scarves, they had also taken bread, meat, wine, and hot coffee with them.</t1015> <t1016>Monsieur Defarge placed the food he had brought and the lantern on the shoemaker's bench (in the attic, there was no other place besides this grassy cushion), then, together with Mr. Lorry, they woke the prisoner and helped him get up from the ground.</t1016>
<t1017>No one looking at that fear-stricken, bewildered face could guess what was going through the shoemaker's mind.</t1017> <t1018>Did he know what was happening, had he understood what was told to him, did he know he was now free, no one could figure it out.</t1018> <t1019>They tried to talk to him; but his mind was so confused and he responded so slowly that they were frightened by his bewildered state and decided not to bother him any further for now.</t1019> <t1020>Every now and then, he would take his head in his hands and shake it like a madman, something he had never done before; on the other hand, he really enjoyed hearing his daughter's voice and would immediately turn to look as soon as she spoke.</t1020>
<t1021>A man who had been oppressed for a long time and had become accustomed to following orders ate the food given to him, drank the drinks, and wore the cloak and other belongings with an obedient demeanor.</t1021> <t1022>When his daughter extended her arm towards him, he immediately responded by taking her hand between his two hands and holding it tightly.</t1022>
<t1023>They started descending the stairs, Monsieur Defarge was leading the way with a lantern in hand, and at the very end of this small procession was Mr. Lorry.</t1023> <t1024>They had only descended a few of the long steps when the shoemaker stopped and looked at the ceiling and around him.</t1024>
<t1025>"Do you remember your arrival here, father?</t1025> <t1026>Climbing these steps?</t1026><t1027>"</t1027>
<t1028>"What did you say?"</t1028><t1029>"</t1029>
<t1030>Even though the girl couldn't repeat her question, he mumbled an answer as if she had.</t1030>
<t1031>"Remember?</t1031> <t1032>No, I don't remember.</t1032> <t1033>It was a very long time ago.</t1033><t1034>"</t1034>
<t1035>It was clear that he remembered nothing about being brought from his cell to that house.</t1035> <t1036>They heard him mutter, "One Hundred Five, North Tower," and when he looked around, they realized he was seeing the strong castle walls that had surrounded him for many years.</t1036> <t1037>When they reached the courtyard, the shoemaker instinctively changed his walk, expecting there to be a drawbridge opening and closing; but there was no bridge, and when he saw the carriage waiting in front of the door, he let go of his daughter's hand and put his head back in his hands.</t1037>
<t1038>There was no one in front of the door; not a single person was looking out from any of the windows, and there wasn't even a single person passing by on the road by chance.</t1038> <t1039>There was an unnatural silence and desolation around.</t1039> <t1040>Only one person stood out, and that was –leaning against the side of the door, her eyes seeing nothing but the knitting in her hands–</t1040> <t1041>Madame Defarge.</t1041>
<t1042>From the front, the convict, and from behind, the girl had just gotten into the car when Mr. Lorry's foot remained on the step as the man pitifully asked for his shoemaking tools and the unfinished shoes.</t1042> <t1043>Madame Defarge immediately called out to her husband, saying she would bring what the man wanted, and went off, knitting as she passed through the lanterns in the courtyard.</t1043> <t1044>She quickly brought the items and gave them to the man, then immediately leaned against the side of the door again, continuing her knitting without looking at anything else.</t1044>
<t1045>Defarge climbed up next to the driver and said, "Take me to the exit gate!"</t1045> <t1046>The coach driver cracked his whip and set off under the feeble light of the swaying street lamp on the hill.</t1046>
<t1047>They arrived at one of the city's exit gates, passing under street lamps that shone brightly on nicer streets and swung with a dimmer light on worse ones, and by illuminated shops, cheerful crowds, bright cafes, and theaters.</t1047> <t1048>Soldiers stood at the checkpoint with lanterns in their hands.</t1048> <t1049>"Show your documents, travelers!</t1049><t1050>"</t1050>
<t1051>Defarge went downstairs and pulled the man aside with a serious demeanor, "Here you go, officer," he said, "the documents of the white-haired man inside are here."</t1051> <t1052>"They handed these documents to me along with him in the thing..."</t1052> <t1053>He lowered his voice, there was a hurried movement among the soldiers with lanterns, and one of them was extended into the carriage by a uniformed arm, and the owner of this uniformed arm's eyes, with an expression far from ordinary, fixed on the white-haired gentleman.</t1053> <t1054>"Alright.</t1054> <t1055>You may pass!" came the voice from the uniform.</t1055> <t1056>"Adieu!" said Defarge.</t1056> <t1057>Thus, they proceeded from under the small forest of dimming lights to the vast forest of stars.</t1057>
<t1058>They were under the motionless and eternal light arch; the lights were so far from this small world that, according to scholars, it was doubtful even the rays were aware of it, as if it were a point where everything in space ended and vanished; the shadows of the night widened and darkened.</t1058> <t1059>Throughout that cold and jolting journey, until dawn, the shadows once again whispered the old question into Mr. Lorry's ear –who was sitting opposite the man brought back from his grave, pondering which of the man's delicate powers were lost forever and which could possibly be restored:</t1059>
<t1060>"I hope you want to be resurrected, is that so?</t1060><t1061>"</t1061>
<t1062>The answer was the same:</t1062>
<t1063>"I don't know.</t1063><t1064>"</t1064>

<t1066>Golden Thread</t1066>
<t1067>I</t1067>
<t1068>Five Years Later</t1068>
<t1069>Even in 1780, Tellson Bank next to Temple Bar looked old-fashioned.</t1069> <t1070>It was very small, dark, and inconvenient.</t1070> <t1071>It was an old-fashioned place, yet the partners of the institution took pride in its smallness, darkness, ugliness, and inconvenience, influenced by the values they held.</t1071> <t1072>They even boasted, thinking these features enhanced the bank's reputation, and believed that without such unsuitable conditions, it would not be as respectable.</t1072> <t1073>This was not a passive thought but an active weapon they directed at businesses with more suitable premises.</t1073> <t1074>According to them, Tellson needed neither more space, nor light, nor showiness.</t1074> <t1075>Perhaps Noakes and Company or the Snooks Brothers Company did; but fortunately, Tellson had no such need!</t1075>
<t1076>If one of the bank's partners' sons were to propose rebuilding Tellson, his father would disinherit him.</t1076> <t1077>In this respect, the bank was no different from the state of the country; it too disinherited sons who proposed to reorganize the laws and traditions that, though inappropriate for so many years, still maintained their respectability.</t1077>
<t1078>Thus, Tellson became known as the triumphant perfection of uselessness.</t1078> <t1079>Accompanied by a feeble creak from its hinge, you would quickly open the stubbornly resistant door, descend two steps as if falling, and enter Tellson's, finding yourself in a wretched little shop with two small counters where the oldest of men would shake your check in his hand as if rustled by the wind, then examine your signature in front of the dirtiest windows imaginable, constantly exposed to the splashes of mud from Fleet Street, further soiled by their own iron bars and the heavy shadow of Temple Bar.</t1079> <t1080>If your business required seeing someone of higher status, you would be taken to a section at the back resembling that of convicts, and there you would ponder your wasted life until that important person came to you with both hands in his pockets, and when he arrived, you would barely make him out in that gloomy twilight.</t1080> <t1081>Your money would go in and out of worm-eaten and old wooden drawers, from which particles would fly into your nose and then your throat as they opened and closed.</t1081> <t1082>The paper money would smell musty, as if rapidly turning into rags.</t1082> <t1083>The gold and silver would be piled right next to a cesspool, and this filthy association would strip them of all their luster within two days.</t1083> <t1084>As for the promissory notes, they would be kept in rooms converted from kitchens and sculleries, and all the oils from the parchment paper would permeate the bank's atmosphere.</t1084> <t1085>The less important boxes containing your family documents would go upstairs to a room with a large dining table that had never been dined upon, and inside these boxes would be the first letters from your old lover or your young children, which would have only recently escaped the horror of being watched by the heads appearing in the windows of Temple Bar, reminiscent of the heartless cruelty and savagery practiced in Abyssinia and Ashantee, even as late as 1780.</t1085>
<t1086>Actually, at that time, the death penalty was quite a popular solution for Tellson as well as for many businesses and institutions.</t1086> <t1087>Why shouldn't it be for the laws when Death was Nature's remedy for everything?</t1087> <t1088>Thus, the counterfeiter received the death penalty; the forger received the death penalty; the person who opened letters without authority received the death penalty; the thief who stole forty shillings received the death penalty; the one who stole a horse in front of Tellson Bank, the swindler, and everyone who, in one way or another, got involved in Crime received the death penalty.</t1088> <t1089>This practice did not actually prevent crimes –it is worth emphasizing that it had the opposite effect– but it cleaned up the problem in each individual case, leaving no matter to deal with.</t1089> <t1090>Indeed, Tellson, at that time, like other major companies of the period, had taken many lives, so much so that if the heads were kept below before being lined up at Temple Bar instead of being thrown away, they would have significantly blocked the little light that reached the ground floor.</t1090>
<t1091>At Tellson's Bank, old men, squeezed among various dark cabinets, were carrying on their work with great seriousness.</t1091> <t1092>When they hired a young clerk at Tellson's London branch, they would hide him somewhere until he aged.</t1092> <t1093>They would store him, like a piece of cheese, in a dark place until he absorbed the Tellson flavor and blue mold.</t1093> <t1094>Only then would he be allowed to emerge, and he would bury himself among the large ledgers, blending into the institution's general heavy atmosphere with his trousers and gaiters.</t1094>
<t1095>In front of Tellson's door stood a man who did errands – never entering unless summoned – sometimes carrying goods, sometimes news; this person was like the bank's living signboard.</t1095> <t1096>He was always there during working hours, and if he had an errand to run, he would go, and during those times, his son would take his place; the twelve-year-old boy, with mischief written all over his face, was a copy of his father.</t1096> <t1097>People knew that they managed this errand man of Tellson's.</t1097> <t1098>The bank had always tolerated people of this sort, and over time and circumstances, it had come to the postal business.</t1098> <t1099>His surname was Cruncher, and after giving up the shady businesses of his youth, he had taken the name Jerry at the church in the eastern part of Houndsditch.</t1099>
<t1100>Yes, Mr. Cruncher's personal residence was in Whitefriars, Hanging-sword Valley; the time was the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and eighty, (Mr. Cruncher always said Anna Domino instead of the year of our Lord; apparently, he thought the Gregorian era was initiated by a lady who added her own name to a popular game invented after that,) on a windy March morning, the clocks showed half-past seven.</t1100>
<t1101>Mr. Cruncher's house was not in a good neighborhood, and although the room with a glass partition could be considered a single room, it could also be called a two-room place.</t1101> <t1102>But they kept it very clean.</t1102> <t1103>Even though it was early on that windy March morning, the room where Cruncher slept had already been swept, and a perfectly clean white cloth was laid on the wooden table set with plates and cups prepared for breakfast.</t1103>
<t1104>Mr. Cruncher lay sprawled like a Harlequin under the patchwork quilt.</t1104> <t1105>At first, he was in a deep sleep, but then he slowly began to stir, tossing and turning, and finally sat up with his hedgehog-like hair that seemed to tear through the sheets.</t1105> <t1106>He shouted from his place with tremendous anger;</t1106>
<t1107>"You started again, geez!"</t1107>
<t1108>A tidy and industrious-looking woman, taking the words personally, rose from the corner where she had knelt in a state of panic and fear.</t1108>
<t1109>"Speak up!" said Mr. Cruncher, searching for his boots on the ground.</t1109> <t1110>"Have you started again?</t1110><t1111>"</t1111>
<t1112>After greeting the morning with this second salutation, he threw one of his boots at the woman as the third.</t1112> <t1113>The boot was covered in mud, which revealed an odd situation about Mr. Cruncher's way of making a living, because although the man usually came home from the bank with clean boots, he would find the same boots covered in mud when he woke up the next morning.</t1113>
<t1114>"Tell me," said Mr. Cruncher, his tone changing after missing the target; "What the hell are you doing, you troublemaker?</t1114><t1115>"</t1115>
<t1116>"I was just praying."</t1116><t1117>"</t1117>
<t1118>"She was just praying!"</t1118> <t1119>"Oh, what a good woman!"</t1119> <t1120>"If you pray, you would only curse me."</t1120><t1121>"</t1121>
<t1122>"I wasn't cursing you; I was truly praying for you."</t1122><t1123>"</t1123>
<t1124>"You weren't doing it.</t1124> <t1125>Even if you did, it wouldn't be worth a damn.</t1125> <t1126>Look! Your mother was such a good woman, Jerry, she's cursing to prevent your father's happiness.</t1126> <t1127>What a respectful mother you have, right son?</t1127> <t1128>And so pious; she's thrown herself to the ground, literally praying to snatch the bread from her only son's mouth.</t1128><t1129>"</t1129>
<t1130>Disturbed by these words, little Cruncher –who was wearing a shirt– turned to his mother and vehemently objected to his food being taken away.</t1130>
<t1131>"What did you think, you stubborn woman," said Mr. Cruncher with an unintended inconsistency, "did you think your prayers would do any good?</t1131> <t1132>What will come of it in return?</t1132><t1133>"</t1133>
<t1134>"I feel like praying, Jerry.</t1134> <t1135>Nothing else.</t1135><t1136>"</t1136>
<t1137>"It was nothing else," repeated Mr. Cruncher.</t1137> <t1138>"It means it has no value.</t1138> <t1139>Whatever it is, don't ever pray for me again.</t1139> <t1140>I don't want it.</t1140> <t1141>Just because you secretly kneel in places like this, my business won't go bad.</t1141> <t1142>If you must kneel, kneel for the sake of your husband and son, not against them.</t1142> <t1143>If a strange woman like you hadn't been this child's strange mother, I would have made a lot of money last week instead of being cursed so much and suffering such misfortune.</t1143> <t1144>Isn't that right?" said Mr. Cruncher, while getting dressed, "If it weren't so, what prayer or incantation could have turned last week into such a disaster for an honest tradesman!</t1144> <t1145>Come on, Jerry, get dressed too, my boy, and keep an eye on your mother while I clean my boots. If you see her kneeling again, let me know immediately.</t1145> <t1146>Look at me," he said again to his wife, "I won't talk to you like this again.</t1146> <t1147>I'm as groggy as a cart horse right now, I feel like I've taken opium, I'm so tense that I can't even feel where the pain is coming from, whether it's me or someone else, I don't have a penny in my pocket, and I think it's because you've been praying from dawn till dusk for me not to have a penny in my pocket, I won't tolerate this any longer.</t1147> <t1148>You troublemaker, do you understand me?</t1148><t1149>"</t1149>
<t1150>On top of all these words, the man had also started to grumble, "Of course!</t1150> <t1151>You are religious.</t1151> <t1152>You wouldn't go against anything related to your husband and child, right?</t1152> <t1153>You wouldn't do such a thing!" Mr. Cruncher, spewing his rising anger with all his sarcasm, started to clean his boots and prepared to go to work.</t1153> <t1154>Meanwhile, his son, whose hedgehog-like hair was relatively soft and whose eyes were as close together as his father's, was not taking his eyes off his mother as he had been told.</t1154> <t1155>While dressing in that tiny space he kept sticking his head out, "Mom is kneeling.</t1155> <t1156>–Hey, dad!" he shouted, disturbing the poor woman, and after creating this fake panic, he would withdraw with an indifferent grin.</t1156>
<t1157>Mr. Cruncher's anger had not subsided even when he sat down for breakfast.</t1157> <t1158>He was annoyed by Ms. Cruncher's grace at the table.</t1158>
<t1159>"Oh man, you troublemaker!</t1159> <t1160>Are you closing the door?</t1160> <t1161>Again?"</t1161>
<t1162>His wife only said she was "grateful."</t1162>
<t1163>"Don't do it!" said Mr. Cruncher, looking around as if a loaf of bread would disappear after his wife's prayer.</t1163> <t1164>"I don't want to be blessed either inside the house or outside.</t1164> <t1165>I don't want the food on my table to be blessed either.</t1165> <t1166>Do you understand?</t1166><t1167>"</t1167>
<t1168>As if he hadn't slept all night from gorging himself at a feast, with bloodshot eyes and all his grumpiness, he ruined breakfast more than he ate it and continued to grumble like any four-legged resident of a zoo.</t1168> <t1169>Around nine o'clock, after gathering his disheveled appearance and adopting a demeanor as respectable and businesslike as possible to hide his natural state, he set off for work.</t1169>
<t1170>Although he liked to describe himself as an "honest tradesman," it was very difficult to call what he did a trade.</t1170> <t1171>All his goods consisted of a wooden stool made from a broken-backed chair, which little Jerry, walking beside his father, would carry every morning to the window of the bank closest to Temple Bar. This stool, and the handfuls of straw collected from every passing vehicle to protect the man doing the fetching and carrying from the cold and rain, constituted the day's headquarters supplies.</t1171> <t1172>Mr. Cruncher at his post was as familiar a figure to Fleet Street and Temple as the Bar itself, though equally unpleasant.</t1172>
<t1173>Arriving at the headquarters area at a quarter to nine and ready to greet the oldest men heading to Tellson with his three-cornered hat, Jerry took his place in his office on this windy March morning, with little Jerry by his side; little Jerry would always stand by his father when he wasn't wandering around Temple Bar looking for children small enough to inflict severe physical and mental harm upon.</t1173> <t1174>Father and son resembled each other greatly, and as they silently watched the morning traffic on Fleet Street, their heads, which stood like two eyes, made them look like a pair of monkeys.</t1174> <t1175>This resemblance was not coincidental; while big Jerry chewed and spat out a straw, little Jerry, with his blinking eyes, watched both his surroundings and his father restlessly.</t1175>
<t1176>One of the attendants at Tellson's Bank stuck his head out the door and called out.</t1176>
<t1177>"They want you!</t1177><t1178>"</t1178>
<t1179>"Hooray, Dad! We started work early!"</t1179><t1180>"</t1180>
<t1181>After bidding farewell to his father, little Jerry sat on the stool, focused again on the straw his father had been chewing for a while, and drifted into thoughts.</t1181>
<t1182>"Always rusty!</t1182> <t1183>His fingers are always rusty!" muttered little Jerry.</t1183> <t1184>"I wonder where my dad finds all that iron rust?</t1184> <t1185>There is no iron rust here!</t1185><t1186>"</t1186>
<t1187>II</t1187>
<t1188>An Appearance</t1188>
<t1189>One of the oldest clerks of Tellson's Bank said to the messenger Jerry, "You know where the Old Bailey Court is, don't you?"</t1189>
<t1190>Jerry responded confidently, "Yes, sir."</t1190> <t1191>"I know Bailey.</t1191><t1192>"</t1192>
<t1193>"Good.</t1193> <t1194>You must also know Mr. Lorry.</t1194><t1195>"</t1195>
<t1196>"Sir, I know Mr. Lorry as well, even better than I know Bailey.</t1196> <t1197>As an honest tradesman," said Jerry, like a somewhat reluctant witness being questioned, "much more than I would ever want to know Bailey.</t1197><t1198>"</t1198>
<t1199>"Great.</t1199> <t1200>Find the door the witnesses entered and show this note sent for Mr. Lorry to the doorman.</t1200> <t1201>Then he will let you in.</t1201><t1202>"</t1202>
<t1203>"To court, sir?"</t1203><t1204>"</t1204>
<t1205>"Yes, to the court."</t1205><t1206>"</t1206>
<t1207>Mr. Cruncher's eyes seemed to have come a little closer together, as if asking each other, "What do you make of this?"</t1207>
<t1208>"Will I wait in the court, sir?" he said as a result of this exchange of ideas.</t1208>
<t1209>"I will tell you now.</t1209> <t1210>The guard at the door will give the note to Mr. Lorry, and you will make gestures to catch his attention and show yourself.</t1210> <t1211>After that, the only thing you need to do is wait in place until you are called.</t1211><t1212>"</t1212>
<t1213>"Is that all, sir?</t1213><t1214>"</t1214>
<t1215>"Yes, that's all.</t1215> <t1216>He wants a messenger to be with him.</t1216> <t1217>You will reveal yourself to him.</t1217><t1218>"</t1218>
<t1219>While the old clerk folded the note and wrote something on it, Mr. Cruncher quietly observed him and when it came time to press the blotting paper, he said; "I suppose they will be judging the counterfeiters today, won't they?"</t1219><t1220>"</t1220>
<t1221>"Traitors to the homeland!"</t1221>
<t1222>"They are going to tear it apart, I mean," said Jerry.</t1222> <t1223>"Inhuman!"</t1223>
<t1224>The old clerk said, "That's the law," in a bewildered manner, fixing his glasses on him.</t1224> <t1225>"That's the law.</t1225><t1226>"</t1226>
<t1227>"According to the laws, tearing a man to pieces is not easy at all; killing is hard, but dismembering must be even harder, sir.</t1227><t1228>"</t1228>
<t1229>"Not that much," replied the old officer.</t1229> <t1230>"Don't talk about the laws like that.</t1230> <t1231>Watch your words, my friend, and don't meddle with the laws.</t1231> <t1232>That's my advice to you.</t1232><t1233>"</t1233>
<t1234>"I say this out of my sorrow, sir," said Jerry.</t1234> <t1235>"Understand how sad the work I do is.</t1235><t1236>"</t1236>
<t1237>"Well, you see," said the old clerk; "we all resort to various means to make a living.</t1237> <t1238>Some are distressing, some are tedious.</t1238> <t1239>Now take this note and be on your way.</t1239><t1240>"</t1240>
<t1241>Jerry took the note and nodded to him as if he respected him greatly, then said to himself, "You old codger," and after informing his son about where he was going, he set off.</t1241>
<t1242>In those days, they used to hang criminals in Tyburn, so the street stretching in front of Newgate Prison did not yet have the bad reputation it would later acquire.</t1242> <t1243>But the prison was a dreadful place, a site of every kind of immorality and depravity, where ominous diseases contracted from defendants coming to court would breed, sometimes even spreading directly from the defendant to the High Judge, toppling him from his bench.</t1243> <t1244>Sometimes, the judge, in his black robe, would sign his own death warrant as well as the defendant's, and would even die before him.</t1244> <t1245>For the rest, Old Bailey was like the courtyard of a deadly infamous inn, where pale-faced travelers were constantly taken away by carriages on a sorrowful journey to the other world; they would proceed slowly on the main streets and roads to serve as a lesson to the public, breaking the hearts of the few kind-hearted citizens, if any.</t1245> <t1246>It was quite an effective, ideal method to bring people to their senses.</t1246> <t1247>The area where the executed were displayed, the wise old prison, was famous for punishments whose extent no one could predict; another old, extremely humane area that softened the situation was the whipping post; here, blood money transactions, an ancestral wisdom leading to the most horrific contract killings imaginable, were conducted.</t1247> <t1248>In short, Old Bailey in those days was a prime example of the principle "What exists is right"; an ultimately lazy aphorism that never considers the troubling consequence it creates, namely the idea that nothing that existed in the past is wrong.</t1248>
<t1249>The messenger moved quietly through the rotten crowd, dispersing the disgusting scene with the skill of a man accustomed to making his own way, found the door he was looking for, and slipped the note through the gap.</t1249> <t1250>In those days, people would pay to watch the proceedings at Old Bailey just as they would pay to watch the shows at Bedlam.</t1250> <t1251>But of course, the ones at Bedlam were much more entertaining.</t1251> <t1252>That's why there were always guards at all the doors of Old Bailey—except for the door through which the defendants entered, which was always left wide open.</t1252>
<t1253>After a brief delay and hesitation, the door hinges reluctantly opened, admitting Mr. Jerry Cruncher into the courtroom.</t1253>
<t1254>He whispered to one of the men next to him, "What's happening?"</t1254>
<t1255>"There is nothing yet.</t1255><t1256>"</t1256>
<t1257>"What will happen then?</t1257><t1258>"</t1258>
<t1259>"Treason case.</t1259><t1260>"</t1260>
<t1261>"They're going to tear it apart, huh?"</t1261>
<t1262>"Ahh!" said the man with relish; "first they will hang him, but just before he dies, they will bring him down and disembowel him in front of his own eyes, then they will take out all his internal organs and burn them while he watches, then they will cut off his head, and the man will be quartered.</t1262> <t1263>This is his punishment.</t1263><t1264>"</t1264>
<t1265>"So, if found Guilty," said Jerry, reminding that it depends on the sentence to be given.</t1265>
<t1266>"Ha! He will definitely be found guilty," said the other.</t1266> <t1267>"Don't worry."</t1267><t1268>"</t1268>
<t1269>Mr. Cruncher's attention at this point shifted to the doorman, who admitted Mr. Lorry inside, with his note in hand.</t1269> <t1270>Mr. Lorry sat down at a table among the other gentlemen with wigs.</t1270> <t1271>He was near a gentleman with a wig who had a pile of papers in front of him, close to the attorney, and directly opposite another gentleman with a wig who, throughout the time Mr. Cruncher was observing, directed all his attention to the ceiling of the court. After Jerry coughed harshly several times, rubbed his chin, and gestured with his hand, he managed to catch the attention of Mr. Lorry, who had stood up to look around. Mr. Lorry quietly nodded his head forward and then sat back down.</t1271>
<t1272>The man he just spoke to asked, "What does he have to do with this case?"</t1272>
<t1273>"Honestly, I don't know either," said Jerry.</t1273>
<t1274>"What concern is it of yours, if I may ask?"</t1274><t1275>"</t1275>
<t1276>"Well, I don't know that either," said Jerry.</t1276>
<t1277>The conversations were interrupted by the commotion caused by the judge's entrance and the rush to settle in the courtroom.</t1277> <t1278>At that moment, everyone's eyes turned to the defendant's stand.</t1278> <t1279>The two guards who had been waiting there went out and brought the defendant, placing him in the barred section.</t1279>
<t1280>Everyone in the room fixed their eyes on the man, except for the gentleman with the wig who was lost in watching the ceiling.</t1280> <t1281>Their breaths enveloped the man like the sea, wind, or fire.</t1281> <t1282>Curious faces stretched out from behind columns and corners to see him; spectators in the back rows stood up to miss nothing; those in the lower part of the room placed their hands on the shoulders of the people in front of them, trying to see the man somehow; some rose on their tiptoes, some climbed onto window sills, and some didn't even know what they were standing on, all to miss no detail about the man.</t1282> <t1283>Amidst all this chaos, Jerry stood upright like the emblematic spiked iron wall of Newgate.</t1283> <t1284>Meanwhile, the smell of the beer he drank on his way mixed with the waves of beer, gin, tea, and coffee emanating from the breaths of others, reaching the defendant and forming a dirty mist and rain on the large windows behind him.</t1284>
<t1285>The target of all these glances and commotion was a young man around twenty-five years old, well-built, handsome, with tanned skin and brown eyes.</t1285> <t1286>He was a perfect gentleman in his demeanor.</t1286> <t1287>He wore a simple, black or dark gray outfit, and his long black hair was tied at the nape of his neck with a ribbon, but this was more to keep his hair from falling into his face than for decoration.</t1287> <t1288>Just as the mind's emotion expresses itself through whatever covers the body, the pallor caused by the man's condition was due to the brownness on his cheek, thus showing that the soul is stronger than the sun.</t1288> <t1289>Otherwise, he was quite a composed man; he had greeted the judge upon entering and was waiting silently.</t1289>
<t1290>The reason for all the gazes and attention directed at him was not something that would elevate humanity.</t1290> <t1291>If he were standing there only with the danger of receiving a lighter sentence – or even the possibility of being spared from one of the cruel tortures – all the excitement would vanish.</t1291> <t1292>The anticipated scene was the shameless punishment of the body condemned to death; the immortal creature that was to be torn apart and shredded had succumbed to this excitement.</t1292> <t1293>No matter what the spectators said about their interest, judging by the various methods and deceitful skills they developed, the underlying cause of this interest was Cruelty.</t1293>
<t1294>"Silence please! Charles Darnay yesterday denied the accusations (with a thousand noises and uproars) that he had, on various occasions and in various forms and ways, betrayed our noble, honorable, unparalleled sovereign King; and that he had aided King Lewis of France in his war against our noble, honorable, unparalleled sovereign King; in other words, that he had traveled between the lands under the dominion of our noble, honorable, unparalleled sovereign King and those of the said French Lewis, and that he had treacherously, deceitfully, cruelly, and basely provided information to the said French Lewis regarding the forces that our noble, honorable, unparalleled sovereign King would send to Canada and North America, declaring himself innocent."</t1294> <t1295>Although the legal terms made Jerry's hair stand on end even more, he was able to make some sense of what was being said, and thus, combining it with the matter that had been discussed over and over again beforehand, he realized that this was the trial of the Charles Darnay standing there; the jury was swearing in, and the gentleman who was the Advocate was beginning his speech.</t1295>
<t1296>The criminal, who was being hanged, beheaded, and dismembered in the minds of those in the courtroom (and who was also aware of this), neither feared the situation nor adopted a pitiable demeanor.</t1296> <t1297>He was silent and attentive; he followed the opening speeches with serious interest and had placed his hands so firmly on the wooden railing in front of him that not a single blade of grass scattered upon it had moved.</t1297> <t1298>To counteract the smell and diseases of the prison, grass had been scattered and vinegar had been poured all over the courtroom.</t1298>
<t1299>A mirror was placed above the defendant's head to reflect the light onto him.</t1299> <t1300>Until then, this mirror had reflected many sinners and wretches, and then they had all departed from the surface of the mirror and from the world.</t1300> <t1301>If the mirror could send back those images it reflected, just as the ocean casts the dead onto the shore, this vile place would be filled with hideous ghosts.</t1301> <t1302>The disgrace and baseness that had occurred in this hall must have also crossed the defendant's mind.</t1302> <t1303>Just as he was thinking about these, he noticed the beam of light hitting his face as he slightly moved, looked up at the ceiling, saw the mirror, and his face turned bright red as he pushed the grass aside with his right hand.</t1303>
<t1304>Then he turned to the left where there was some movement.</t1304> <t1305>His eyes immediately caught two people sitting a little further away, in the corner where the Judge's bench was; the demeanor of the defendant had changed so suddenly that all eyes on him immediately turned to where he was looking.</t1305>
<t1306>The audience saw two seated individuals, a young lady in her twenties and a gentleman who was clearly her father; the man was immediately noticeable with his snow-white hair and an indescribable intensity of emotion on his face; but it was not a lively face, rather it had a look of someone lost in thought, as if talking to himself.</t1306> <t1307>In this state, he appeared to be an old man; but when this expression faded – as it did now, while he was talking to his daughter – he became a handsome man, as if in the prime of his life.</t1307>
<t1308>The girl was sitting with her arm linked through her father's, and she had placed her other hand on his arm.</t1308> <t1309>She had snuggled up to her father, both from the horror of the scene she witnessed and out of pity for the defendant.</t1309> <t1310>Her brow was deeply furrowed, influenced by the strange terror surrounding her, the severity of the defendant's situation, and the compassion she felt.</t1310> <t1311>This expression was so noticeable, strong, and natural that even the spectators who felt no pity for the defendant were affected by it, and whispers arose:</t1311>
<t1312>"Who are they?"</t1312><t1313>"</t1313>
<t1314>While making his own observations in his secluded corner and busy sucking the rust off his finger, the messenger Jerry leaned in to hear who these people were.</t1314> <t1315>The question from the crowd around him had reached the officer at the other end and then returned at a relatively slow pace, and the information finally reached Jerry:</t1315>
<t1316>"They were witnesses."</t1316><t1317>"</t1317>
<t1318>"Whose witnesses are they?"</t1318>
<t1319>"They were witnesses against."</t1319><t1320>"</t1320>
<t1321>"Against whom?"</t1321>
<t1322>"The defendant's.</t1322><t1323>"</t1323>
<t1324>The Judge, whose eyes were turned to where everyone was looking, called them over and leaned back, and as the Prosecutor got up to twist the rope, sharpen the axe, and hammer the nails into the gallows, he fixed his eyes on the man whose life depended on him.</t1324>
<t1325>III</t1325>
<t1326>A Disappointment</t1326>
<t1327>The prosecutor had to inform the jury that, although the defendant was young, he was experienced in the matter of treason, which would cost him his life.</t1327><t1328>His relationship with enemies of the state did not belong to today, yesterday, last year, or even the year before.</t1328><t1329>He had been traveling back and forth between France and England for a very long time, and it was very clear that he was involved in secret activities that he could not explain.</t1329><t1330>If treason had engulfed everything (fortunately, this was not the case), the true evil and guilt of his actions might never have come to light.</t1330><t1331>Fortunately, God had given a servant, free from fear and sin, the duty to uncover the conspiracies organized by this defendant and, in horror, to explain all this to His Majesty's assistant and the honorable Privy Council.</t1331><t1332>This patriotic individual was now about to come before them.</t1332><t1333>He was a person of utmost nobility in both position and demeanor.</t1333><t1334>This person was a friend of the defendant, but on a fateful and troublesome day, upon realizing his disgrace, he decided that he could no longer embrace this traitor or harbor him at the sacred altar of his homeland.</t1334><t1335>If statues were erected in England, as in ancient Rome and Greece, for those who had benefited the public, this extraordinary citizen would certainly have had a statue.</t1335><t1336>But since there was no such decision, he probably would not have a statue.</t1336><t1337>As poets have said, Virtue had a contagious nature (he thought many of the jurors knew many poems by heart, line by line; yet the jurors' faces bore a guilty expression indicating they knew nothing about poems); especially what was known as patriotism and love of country was a radiant virtue.</t1337><t1338>This example of purity and perfection, who was to testify on behalf of the King and whom it was an honor to even speak of, had contacted the defendant's servant and inspired in him a sacred determination to rummage through his master's desk drawers and pockets and to hide certain documents.</t1338><t1339>The prosecutor was actually ready to hear derogatory remarks about this commendable servant; but he preferred him over his own brothers and showed him more respect than he did to his own parents.</t1339><t1340>He then invited the jurors to act in the same manner.</t1340><t1341>The evidence presented by these two witnesses and the other documents they had obtained would show how the defendant was equipped with information about Her Majesty's armies, and furthermore, it was an undeniable fact that he had always conveyed information about the structuring and preparations on land and sea to enemy forces.</t1341><t1342>Perhaps it could not be proven that the lists were written in the defendant's handwriting; but this changed nothing; in fact, it was better for the case as it showed how cunning the defendant was in taking precautions.</t1342><t1343>The evidence dated back five years and showed that the defendant had undertaken this harmful duty even then, a few weeks before the first clashes between the British and American armies.</t1343><t1344>For these reasons, the patriotic (he was sure of this) and responsible (he was also sure of this) jurors should definitely declare this defendant Guilty, and whether they were pleased with this situation or not, they should end his life.</t1344><t1345>Unless this defendant's head was cut off, neither the jurors could rest their heads on their pillows in peace, nor could they tolerate their wives resting their heads on their pillows, nor could they bear the thought of their children resting their heads on their pillows; in short, none of them would be able to rest their heads on their pillows in peace and tranquility.</t1345><t1346>The Chief Prosecutor concluded his speech by reiterating his demand for the defendant to be found guilty in the name of everything conceivable; in fact, as a result of all the legal claims he had put forward, the defendant was already dead to him.</t1346>
<t1347>When the chief prosecutor's speech ended, a murmur broke out in the courtroom; it was as if a swarm of horseflies, sensing what was about to happen, had gathered around the defendant.</t1347> <t1348>When the noise subsided, the impeccable patriot had taken his place in the witness stand.</t1348>
<t1349>The deputy chief prosecutor, under the leadership of his superior, began to question the patriotic witness; the gentleman's name was John Barsad.</t1349> <t1350>This good man's story was exactly as the Chief Prosecutor had told it – in fact, it was too much the same.</t1350> <t1351>After the man had unburdened himself of the load he carried in that noble bosom, he was about to withdraw modestly when the wigged man with papers in front of him, sitting just a little beyond Mr. Lorry, wanted to ask him a few questions.</t1351> <t1352>The wigged man sitting directly opposite was still looking at the ceiling.</t1352>
<t1353>Had he ever committed espionage?</t1353><t1354>No, he had grimaced at the suggestion.</t1354><t1355>How did he make a living?</t1355><t1356>With his private properties.</t1356><t1357>Where was his private property?</t1357><t1358>He didn't remember exactly where it was.</t1358><t1359>What was it?</t1359><t1360>It was nobody's business.</t1360><t1361>Had he inherited it from someone?</t1361><t1362>Yes, it was an inheritance.</t1362><t1363>From whom had he inherited it?</t1363><t1364>From a distant relative.</t1364><t1365>Was this relative very distant?</t1365><t1366>A bit.</t1366><t1367>Had he ever been imprisoned?</t1367><t1368>Absolutely not. Had he never been in a debtor's prison?</t1368><t1369>What did this have to do with the case?</t1369><t1370>Had he never been in a debtor's prison?</t1370><t1371>The question came again.</t1371><t1372>Never? Yes, he had been.</t1372><t1373>How many times?</t1373><t1374>Two or three times.</t1374><t1375>Could it be five or six times?</t1375><t1376>Maybe.</t1376><t1377>What was his profession?</t1377><t1378>A gentleman.</t1378><t1379>Had he ever been kicked?</t1379><t1380>Possibly.</t1380><t1381>Often? No.</t1381><t1382>Had he ever been kicked down the stairs?</t1382><t1383>Absolutely not; once he had been kicked at the top of the stairs and had fallen down on his own.</t1383><t1384>Was he kicked for cheating at dice?</t1384><t1385>The drunk who attacked him had said so, but it wasn't true.</t1385><t1386>Could he swear it wasn't true?</t1386><t1387>Of course.</t1387><t1388>Had he ever made a living by cheating at gambling?</t1388><t1389>Never.</t1389><t1390>Had he ever made a living by gambling?</t1390><t1391>As much as other gentlemen played.</t1391><t1392>Had he ever borrowed money from a prisoner?</t1392><t1393>Yes.</t1393><t1394>Had he paid him back?</t1394><t1395>No.</t1395><t1396>Was his relationship with the prisoner, which wasn't that close, limited to forced conversations in the stagecoach, inn, or on the steamboat?</t1396><t1397>No.</t1397><t1398>Was he sure he had seen these lists in the prisoner's possession?</t1398><t1399>He was sure. Did he know anything else about these lists?</t1399><t1400>No.</t1400><t1401>Could he have produced them himself?</t1401><t1402>No.</t1402><t1403>Was there anything he would receive in exchange for this evidence?</t1403><t1404>No.</t1404><t1405>Was he receiving money from the government to set traps?</t1405><t1406>Absolutely not. Or for anything else?</t1406><t1407>Oh, no! Would he swear?</t1407><t1408>Of course.</t1408><t1409>Was his only reason for being there his patriotism?</t1409><t1410>Absolutely.</t1410>
<t1411>The virtuous servant Roger Ciy took a long oath on the witness stand.</t1411> <t1412>Four years ago, he had started working alongside the defendant with all his goodwill and naivety.</t1412> <t1413>On the Calais ship, he had asked the defendant if he needed an assistant, and the defendant had taken him on; it wasn't out of kindness that he wanted to be hired by the defendant, such a thing had never crossed his mind.</t1413> <t1414>But later, he started to suspect the defendant and began to watch him.</t1414> <t1415>While preparing the defendant's clothes for travel, he constantly saw similar lists in the defendant's pockets.</t1415> <t1416>He had also taken these lists from the defendant's desk drawer.</t1416> <t1417>It wasn't the first time he had seen them.</t1417> <t1418>He had seen the defendant show the same lists to the French in Calais, and similar ones to the French in both Calais and Boulogne.</t1418> <t1419>He loved his country, he couldn't tolerate this, so he informed the necessary people.</t1419> <t1420>He had never been suspected of stealing a silver teapot; there had been a slander about a mustard pot, but that had also turned out to be a coating.</t1420> <t1421>He had known the last witness for seven or eight years; but it was entirely coincidental.</t1421> <t1422>It couldn't be called a strange coincidence; coincidences were mostly strange anyway.</t1422> <t1423>Moreover, he didn't see his sole motive of patriotism as a strange coincidence.</t1423> <t1424>He was a true Briton and hoped that many people were like him.</t1424>
<t1425>The flies buzzed again and summoned Chief Prosecutor Mr. Jarvis Lorry.</t1425>
<t1426>"Mr. Jarvis Lorry, you work at Tellson's Bank, don't you?</t1426><t1427>"</t1427>
<t1428>"Yes.</t1428><t1429>"</t1429>
<t1430>"Did you travel from London to Dover by mail coach for business on a Friday night in November 1775?</t1430><t1431>"</t1431>
<t1432>"I went.</t1432><t1433>"</t1433>
<t1434>"Was there any other passenger in the car?</t1434><t1435>"</t1435>
<t1436>"There were two more people."</t1436><t1437>"</t1437>
<t1438>"Did these people get off on the road at night?</t1438><t1439>"</t1439>
<t1440>"They got off.</t1440><t1441>"</t1441>
<t1442>"Mr. Lorry, look carefully at the face of the defendant.</t1442> <t1443>Was this person one of the two passengers?</t1443><t1444>"</t1444>
<t1445>"It's very hard to say this.</t1445><t1446>"</t1446>
<t1447>"Does he look like one of those two travelers?"</t1447><t1448>"</t1448>
<t1449>"Both were tightly wrapped up, it was a very dark night, and everyone was in their own world; it is really hard to say anything."</t1449><t1450>"</t1450>
<t1451>"Mr. Lorry, look at the defendant's face once more.</t1451> <t1452>If you consider the defendant being wrapped up like those two passengers, can you say that in terms of build and stance, he resembles neither of them?</t1452><t1453>"</t1453>
<t1454>"No.</t1454><t1455>"</t1455>
<t1456>"Well, can you swear that you are not one of them, Mr. Lorry?"</t1456>
<t1457>"No.</t1457><t1458>"</t1458>
<t1459>"So, you're saying it could be one of those two passengers?</t1459><t1460>"</t1460>
<t1461>"Yes.</t1461> <t1462>Only the other two passengers – just like me – were afraid of highway robbers, whereas this defendant doesn't seem scared at all.</t1462><t1463>"</t1463>
<t1464>"Have you ever witnessed false cowardice, Mr. Lorry?</t1464><t1465>"</t1465>
<t1466>"Of course I saw it."</t1466><t1467>"</t1467>
<t1468>"Mr. Lorry, look at the defendant's face once more.</t1468> <t1469>Have you ever seen him before?</t1469><t1470>"</t1470>
<t1471>"Yes, I had seen it."</t1471><t1472>"</t1472>
<t1473>"When?"</t1473><t1474>"</t1474>
<t1475>"A few days later, I was returning from France, and he boarded the steamer I boarded in Calais, and we traveled together.</t1475><t1476>"</t1476>
<t1477>"When did he/she get on the ferry?"</t1477><t1478>"</t1478>
<t1479>"A little past midnight."</t1479><t1480>"</t1480>
<t1481>"In the dead of night.</t1481> <t1482>Was he the only passenger boarding at that hour?</t1482><t1483>"</t1483>
<t1484>"It was the only one by chance.</t1484><t1485>"</t1485>
<t1486>"Forget about the coincidence, Mr. Lorry.</t1486> <t1487>He was the only passenger who boarded in the dead of night, wasn't he?</t1487><t1488>"</t1488>
<t1489>"Yes.</t1489><t1490>"</t1490>
<t1491>"Were you traveling alone, Mr. Lorry, or was there someone with you?"</t1491><t1492>"</t1492>
<t1493>"There were two people with me.</t1493> <t1494>A gentleman and a lady.</t1494> <t1495>Now they are here.</t1495><t1496>"</t1496>
<t1497>"Yes, yes.</t1497> <t1498>Had you spoken with the defendant at that time?</t1498><t1499>"</t1499>
<t1500>"Not much.</t1500> <t1501>The weather was stormy, the journey was long and difficult; I lay down on a seat and slept almost the entire way.</t1501><t1502>"</t1502>
<t1503>"Miss Manette!"</t1503>
<t1504>Everyone turned their eyes again to the young lady they had just looked at, and she also stood up.</t1504> <t1505>Her father also stood up with her, still holding her arm.</t1505> <t1506>"Miss Manette, look at the defendant's face.</t1506><t1507>"</t1507>
<t1508>For the defendant, facing this symbol of youth and beauty was much harder than facing the entire crowd.</t1508> <t1509>At that moment, the crowd, who had their eyes fixed on him as if waiting at the head of a grave, was not enough to calm him down.</t1509> <t1510>He hastily threw the grass in front of him into imaginary flower beds in a garden.</t1510> <t1511>While trying to control his breath and calm down, his trembling lips had turned completely white, and all the color had rushed to his heart.</t1511> <t1512>The buzzing of the big flies had increased again.</t1512>
<t1513>"Miss Manette, had you seen the defendant before?</t1513><t1514>"</t1514>
<t1515>"Yes, sir.</t1515><t1516>"</t1516>
<t1517>"Where did you see it?</t1517><t1518>"</t1518>
<t1519>"As mentioned earlier, sir, on the ferry, the same night.</t1519><t1520>"</t1520>
<t1521>"So, the lady mentioned earlier is you."</t1521><t1522>"</t1522>
<t1523>"Ah! Unfortunately, it is so, sir!"</t1523><t1524>"</t1524>
<t1525>The young girl's tearful voice full of compassion.</t1525> <t1526>When the judge spoke in a stern manner, it got lost within his voice, which was not at all harmonious.</t1526> <t1527>"Only answer the questions asked of you and do not make any comments.</t1527><t1528>"</t1528>
<t1529>"Miss Manette, did you ever share a cabin with the defendant while crossing the English Channel?"</t1529><t1530>"</t1530>
<t1531>"Yes sir.</t1531><t1532>"</t1532>
<t1533>"Tell me.</t1533><t1534>"</t1534>
<t1535>In the deepening silence, the young girl began to speak in a faint voice:</t1535>
<t1536>"When the gentleman boarded the ferry-"</t1536>
<t1537>The judge frowned and asked, "Are you talking about the defendant?"</t1537>
<t1538>"Yes, sir.</t1538><t1539>"</t1539>
<t1540>"Then call him the defendant."</t1540><t1541>"</t1541>
<t1542>"When the defendant boarded the ferry, my father," at this moment the girl lovingly turned her eyes towards her father standing next to her, "noticed that he was very exhausted and ill.</t1542> <t1543>My father was so weak that I was afraid to move him, and I made him a bed on the deck, next to the stairs leading to the cabins; then I sat down beside him to take care of him.</t1543> <t1544>That night, there were no other passengers besides the four of us.</t1544> <t1545>The defendant even kindly asked for my permission to suggest what I should do to better protect my father from the wind and cold weather.</t1545> <t1546>I didn't know how to do it.</t1546> <t1547>I couldn't tell which direction the wind would blow from when we left the port.</t1547> <t1548>He helped me.</t1548> <t1549>He showed great kindness and concern towards my father, and I'm sure he was sincere while doing it.</t1549> <t1550>Thus, we started talking.</t1550><t1551>"</t1551>
<t1552>"Well, I will ask something.</t1552> <t1553>Did he board the ferry alone?</t1553><t1554>"</t1554>
<t1555>"No"</t1555>
<t1556>"How many people were with you?"</t1556><t1557>"</t1557>
<t1558>"There were two French gentlemen.</t1558><t1559>"</t1559>
<t1560>"Did they talk?"</t1560><t1561>"</t1561>
<t1562>"They talked until the last moment, that is, until the time the French had to return to their boats.</t1562><t1563>"</t1563>
<t1564>"Was there a paper exchange similar to these lists between them?"</t1564>
<t1565>"There was an exchange of papers between them, but I don't know what it was about.</t1565><t1566>"</t1566>
<t1567>"Were the papers of this size and shape?</t1567><t1568>"</t1568>
<t1569>"It might be, but I can't be sure despite their whispering very close to me; they were standing at the top of the stairs leading down to the cabins to take advantage of the light from the hanging lamp; the light was dim and they were speaking very softly, I couldn't hear what they were talking about, I only saw that they were looking at papers."</t1569><t1570>"</t1570>
<t1571>"Now let's return to your conversation with the defendant, Miss Manette.</t1571><t1572>"</t1572>
<t1573>"The defendant – perhaps due to my helplessness – was very reassuring and very kind, good, and helpful to my father," she said, bursting into tears, and added, "If I say anything that would harm him, I can never repay my debt to him."</t1573><t1574></t1574>
<t1575>A hum rose from their backs again.</t1575>
<t1576>"Miss Manette, if the defendant does not understand that you are obligated to provide this evidence – that is, you must provide it – and that you cannot escape from this, there is nothing that can be done.</t1576> <t1577>Please continue.</t1577><t1578>"</t1578>
<t1579>"He told me that he was traveling because of a delicate and difficult task that could cause trouble for people, and that's why he was using an alias.</t1579> <t1580>He had gone to France for a few days for this task and explained that he might travel back and forth between France and England at intervals for a longer period.</t1580><t1581>"</t1581>
<t1582>"Did Miss Manette say anything about America? Think carefully.</t1582><t1583>"</t1583>
<t1584>"He tried to explain to me how the dispute started and said that what England did was, in his opinion, wrong and foolish.</t1584> <t1585>He also jokingly said that George Washington would go down in history as an important name, just like George III.</t1585> <t1586>But he said this not with ill intent, but laughingly, for fun.</t1586> <t1587>He didn't mean it in a bad way, he said it with a smile, just for amusement.</t1587><t1588>"</t1588>
<t1589>In this intriguing scene where all eyes were directed, the audience would unconsciously mimic any stern expression that appeared on the lead actor's face.</t1589> <t1590>When he explained this evidence, the young lady's forehead wrinkled with pain and she became attentive, and during the moments when the Judge paused to take notes, he looked at both the defense attorney and the prosecutor to see the impact of his words.</t1590> <t1591>The same expression was on the faces of the spectators all around the courtroom; so much so that when the Judge looked up from his notes and stared intently regarding the dreadful misdeed related to George Washington, many of their foreheads were like mirrors reflecting the witness.</t1591>
<t1592>The Chief Prosecutor, in all his grandeur, expressed that it was necessary to summon the young lady's father, Doctor Manette, in terms of precaution and procedure.</t1592> <t1593>Thus, Mr. Manette was called to the witness stand.</t1593>
<t1594>"Doctor Manette, look at the face of the defendant.</t1594> <t1595>Have you ever seen him before?</t1595><t1596>"</t1596>
<t1597>"Once.</t1597> <t1598>He had visited my house in London.</t1598> <t1599>About three or three and a half years ago.</t1599><t1600>"</t1600>
<t1601>"Don't you remember the passenger who was traveling next to you on the ferry and talking to your daughter?</t1601><t1602>"</t1602>
<t1603>"I don't remember such a thing, sir."</t1603><t1604>"</t1604>
<t1605>"Could there be a specific reason why you can't remember these?"</t1605><t1606>"</t1606>
<t1607>Mr. Manette replied in a low voice, "There is."</t1607><t1608>"</t1608>
<t1609>"In your own country, you were imprisoned for a long time without trial, and without even being charged with any crime, weren't you, Doctor Manette?</t1609><t1610>"</t1610>
<t1611>In a tone that tore at everyone's heart, Mr. Manette replied, "For a very long time indeed."</t1611>
<t1612>"In the mentioned situation, had you just been released?"</t1612><t1613>"</t1613>
<t1614>"That's what they say.</t1614><t1615>"</t1615>
<t1616>"Don't you remember that moment at all?</t1616><t1617>"</t1617>
<t1618>"No.</t1618> <t1619>My mind has been blank since –I don't even know since when– from the times I started making shoes by myself in prison, to the moment I found myself in London beside my dear daughter, empty.</t1619> <t1620>Thank God I remembered my daughter when the Almighty restored my skills; but I am not even in a position to say how I remembered her.</t1620> <t1621>I don't remember anything from that period.</t1621><t1622>"</t1622>
<t1623>The Chief Prosecutor sat down, then the father and bz also took their places.</t1623> <t1624>Then, a strange development occurred in the trial.</t1624> <t1625>According to the information obtained, the defendant, five years ago.</t1625> <t1626>On that Friday night in November, had boarded the Dover Mail with an unidentified accomplice, then disembarked somewhere in the pitch dark of the night, but did not stay there long, had walked ten to fifteen kilometers back to a garrison and dockyard to gather information; but then a witness was called who claimed that at that time, the defendant was waiting for someone else in the tea lounge of a hotel in the town where the mentioned garrison and dockyard were located.</t1626> <t1627>The defendant's lawyer had asked this new witness many questions, but received no answer other than that he had never seen the defendant at any other time; just then, the wigged man who had been watching the ceiling of the courtroom until that moment scribbled something on a piece of paper, crumpled it, and threw it to the lawyer.</t1627> <t1628>During the first break, the lawyer opened this paper and looked at the defendant with great interest and curiosity.</t1628>
<t1629>"Are you sure this person is the defendant?" The witness was quite sure.</t1629>
<t1630>"Have you ever seen someone who looks very much like the defendant?" He had not seen anyone who looked so similar that it would cause confusion (the witness had said exactly this).</t1630>
<t1631>The man who threw the paper pointed and said, "Look at the gentleman sitting over there, that wise person, and then look at the defendant.</t1631> <t1632>What do you say?</t1632> <t1633>Don't they look very much alike?</t1633><t1634>"</t1634>
<t1635>If we disregard the appearance of our wise friend, which, although not immoral, could be described as disheveled and slovenly, it could be said that when compared to each other, they resembled each other so much that it would astonish not only the witness but everyone present.</t1635> <t1636>The judge, upon the prosecutor's request, ordered our wise friend to remove his wig, which made this resemblance even more apparent.</t1636> <t1637>The judge asked Mr. Stryver (the defendant's lawyer) whether the other person they were going to try for treason was Mr. Carton (our wise friend).</t1637> <t1638>Mr. Stryver told the judge no; but he would ask the witness to tell the judge the likelihood of something happening again once it had happened once; if he had seen his imprudence before, would he still speak so confidently or would he still speak confidently even after seeing it, were among the many questions on his mind.</t1638> <t1639>The aim was to crush this witness and nullify his part of the case.</t1639>
<t1640>Mr. Cruncher had eaten all the rust off his fingers as if it were lunch while watching the witnesses.</t1640><t1641>Now he was watching with curiosity as Mr. Stryver fitted the defendant's case onto the jury like a well-tailored suit; he was telling them that the so-called patriot Barsad was a secret spy and traitor, and moreover, a shameless blood merchant, and the greatest traitor since the accursed Judas – to whom he indeed bore a resemblance.</t1641><t1642>He explained that the very virtuous servant Cly was his friend and partner and that he deserved such company; that the fraudsters and false witnesses had chosen the defendant as their victim due to family matters in France, after all, he was of French origin and had to cross the Channel frequently – but these family matters, which concerned those close to him, prevented him from explaining all this, even at the cost of his life.</t1642><t1643>The words forcibly taken and distorted from the young lady meant nothing, and everyone had witnessed how much she suffered while saying them; in that environment, such innocent conversation and courtesy between a young gentleman and lady were very natural; meanwhile, those excessive words about George Washington could be nothing but a bad joke.</t1643><t1644>It would appear as a weakness of the state to halt the attempts to apply the lowest levels of national hatred and fears, so the Attorney General had done his best; but it was to no avail, these disgraceful and vile pieces of evidence frequently tainted such cases, and there were many trials like this in the country.</t1644><t1645>But the courts, which were packed to the brim, should not be occupied with such baseless cases.</t1645><t1646>But there the Judge objected (with a stern expression on his face as if what was being said was not true) and said from his bench that he could not allow these insinuations.</t1646>
<t1647>Then Mr. Stryver called a few more witnesses, and while Mr. Cruncher waited, the Attorney General turned the suit that Mr. Stryver had dressed the jury in inside out; that is, he explained that both Barsad and Cly were much better people than the lawyer had thought, and the defendant was a much worse person.</t1647> <t1648>Finally, the Judge turned that suit inside out, then right side out, but in the end, he decisively cut it and fashioned a shroud for the defendant.</t1648> <t1649>When it came time for the jury members' deliberation, the large flies gathered in the courtroom once again.</t1649>
<t1650>Mr. Carton, who had been sitting with his eyes fixed on the ceiling of the hall for hours, had neither changed his position nor his demeanor even in this confusion.</t1650> <t1651>His wise friend Mr. Stryver, who was gathering the papers in front of him, was whispering to those beside him while occasionally glancing anxiously at the jury; meanwhile, the Judge had risen from his seat and was pacing up and down the podium, causing the audience to suspect he had a fever; the man sitting back with his torn robe half fallen, his disheveled wig crooked after falling off, and his hands in his pockets still had his eyes on the ceiling.</t1651> <t1652>The indifference in his manner not only gave him a disreputable air but also diminished his strong resemblance to the defendant (though the resemblance had increased a moment ago with the seriousness that arose when they were compared), so much so that most of the spectators who noticed him were whispering that they didn't look much alike.</t1652> <t1653>Mr. Cruncher was also sharing his observations with the man next to him: "I bet this man never wins a case.</t1653> <t1654>He doesn't look like the type who can win a case, does he?</t1654><t1655>"</t1655>
<t1656>Despite his indifferent appearance, Mr. Carton was watching everything in detail, and when Miss Manette's head fell onto her father's chest, he was the first to see it, and as soon as he saw it, he shouted in a voice that everyone could hear, "Hey, attendant!</t1656> <t1657>Quick, look after the young lady.</t1657> <t1658>Help the gentleman so he can take the lady outside.</t1658> <t1659>She's about to faint!"</t1659>
<t1660>As the girl was being taken outside, a great sense of pity for her and compassion for her father arose in the hall.</t1660> <t1661>It was clear that recalling the prison days had disturbed her greatly.</t1661> <t1662>During the interrogation, she felt a deep pain inside, and the pensive and thoughtful demeanor that made her look older had settled over her like a heavy cloud.</t1662> <t1663>As she was leaving, the jury members returning to their seats remained silent for a moment, then the jury spokesperson spoke.</t1663>
<t1664>They couldn't come to a decision and wanted to reconvene.</t1664> <t1665>The judge was surprised when he heard they couldn't come to a decision (perhaps he still had George Washington on his mind), but after expressing that he would be pleased if they locked themselves in a room under supervision and talked, he also withdrew to another room.</t1665> <t1666>The trial had lasted all day and the lamps in the hall had been lit.</t1666> <t1667>Rumors had started circulating in the hall that the jury members wouldn't come for a long time.</t1667> <t1668>The spectators went outside to drink something, and the defendant went behind the section he was in and sat down.</t1668>
<t1669>Mr. Lorry, who had followed the young lady and her father outside, had now returned to the lounge and was signaling to Jerry.</t1669> <t1670>Jerry, whose interest in the matter had waned, immediately came over to him.</t1670>
<t1671>"Jerry, if you want to get something to eat, go ahead.</t1671> <t1672>But don't go too far.</t1672> <t1673>Stay within earshot of the jury's arrival.</t1673> <t1674>Don't be late even for a second, because I want you to deliver the verdict to the bank immediately.</t1674> <t1675>You are the fastest messenger I've ever seen, and I'm sure you'll be at Temple Bar long before me.</t1675><t1676>"</t1676>
<t1677>Jerry scratched his narrow forehead after hearing these words and being handed a shilling.</t1677> <t1678>At that moment, Mr. Carton came over and touched Mr. Lorry's arm.</t1678>
<t1679>"How is the little lady?</t1679><t1680>"</t1680>
<t1681>"Very sad; but her father is calming her down, she feels a bit better because she has left the courtroom."</t1681><t1682>"</t1682>
<t1683>"I will convey this to the defendant.</t1683> <t1684>It would not be appropriate for a respectable banker like you to speak with him in front of everyone." Mr. Lorry blushed because he had been weighing this in his mind for a while, and Mr. Carton proceeded towards the section where the defendant was.</t1684> <t1685>The exit of the court was in that direction, and Jerry, with his upright, attentive demeanor and stiff hair, followed him.</t1685>
<t1686>"Mr. Darnay!"</t1686>
<t1687>The defendant immediately stepped forward.</t1687>
<t1688>"Naturally, you are worried about Miss Manette.</t1688> <t1689>She will recover though.</t1689> <t1690>You saw her at her worst.</t1690><t1691>"</t1691>
<t1692>"I'm very sorry for causing such a thing.</t1692> <t1693>Also, please convey my thanks to him.</t1693><t1694>"</t1694>
<t1695>"Of course.</t1695> <t1696>If you want, I can convey it.</t1696><t1697>"</t1697>
<t1698>Mr. Carton had an almost indifferent attitude that bordered on arrogance.</t1698> <t1699>He stood there, turned sideways to the defendant, with his elbow resting on the bars of the defendant's box.</t1699>
<t1700>"I am requesting from you.</t1700> <t1701>Accept my heartfelt thanks.</t1701><t1702>"</t1702>
<t1703>Carton, still turned sideways to the defendant, asked, "What kind of verdict do you think will come out, Mr. Darnay?"</t1703>
<t1704>"The worst."</t1704><t1705>"</t1705>
<t1706>"This is the wisest and most likely thing to happen."</t1706> <t1707>"But the fact that they have gone inside to make a decision is in your favor."</t1707><t1708>"</t1708>
<t1709>It was hard to linger at the exit of the hall, so Jerry didn't hear any more.</t1709> <t1710>Leaving them side by side, alone with their reflections in the mirror above – although they looked very similar, their attitudes were completely different – he left.</t1710>
<t1711>Even though he passed the time by eating a meat pastry and drinking beer, an hour and a half had been very difficult in the passages teeming with thieves and ruffians.</t1711> <t1712>The hoarse-voiced messenger, who was dozing off on something not very comfortable after his meal, found himself caught in the loud buzz and flood of people climbing the stairs leading to the courtroom.</t1712>
<t1713>When he arrived at the court, Mr. Lorry was calling to him from the door, "Jerry!</t1713> <t1714>Jerry!"</t1714>
<t1715>"I am here, sir!</t1715> <t1716>It was very difficult to come.</t1716> <t1717>But I came, sir!</t1717><t1718>"</t1718>
<t1719>Mr. Lorry handed a paper to the messenger in the crowd.</t1719> <t1720>"Quick! Did you get it?</t1720><t1721>"</t1721>
<t1722>"Yes, sir!</t1722><t1723>"</t1723>
<t1724>In the hastily written note, there were only two words "ACQUITTED.</t1724><t1725>"</t1725>
<t1726>As Jerry was turning, he muttered to himself, "If you had sent a message saying 'Resurrected' again, I would understand what you were talking about this time."</t1726>
<t1727>He had no chance to speak, think, or do anything else until he got away from the Old Bailey Court; the crowd was flowing out with such excitement that Jerry's knees buckled, and the bewildered horseflies scattered around with an intense buzz, as if hoping to find another carcass.</t1727>
<t1728>IV</t1728>
<t1729>Congratulations</t1729>
<t1730>As the last people from the crowd that had been bustling all day streamed out of the courtroom, which was dimly lit, Dr. Manette, his daughter Lucie Manette, Mr. Lorry, and the defense attorney and solicitor Mr. Stryver gathered around Mr. Charles Darnay – the person who had just been acquitted – congratulating him for escaping death.</t1730>
<t1731>It was difficult to connect the sharp-faced and upright Doctor Manette with the shoemaker in the attic in Paris, even in a brighter light.</t1731> <t1732>But no one could look at his face a second time; the opportunity to observe him did not extend to hearing the mournful harmony of his low and gloomy voice or noticing the occasional absent-mindedness that settled over him like a cloud for no reason.</t1732> <t1733>There was always a completely different reason deep within his soul that evoked this feeling – as it was during the trial – something related to his long-standing sorrowful state, but sometimes this feeling arose on its own, and then a sadness that those who did not know his story could never understand enveloped him, as if the shadow of the Bastille, three hundred kilometers away, fell upon him even in that summer sun.</t1733>
<t1734>The only person who could disperse these dark clouds in his mind was his daughter.</t1734> <t1735>She was the golden thread that connected him to a Past beyond his suffering and a Present beyond this suffering; the tone of her voice, the light of her face, the touch of her hand always had a wonderful effect on her father.</t1735> <t1736>Actually, not always, because there were moments when even his daughter's power was not enough; but these were not too many, moreover, his daughter now believed that these had come to an end.</t1736>
<t1737>After Mr. Darnay kissed Miss Manette's hand with great enthusiasm and gratitude, he turned to Mr. Stryver and thanked him sincerely.</t1737> <t1738>Although he was a little over thirty years old, Mr. Stryver, who looked twenty years younger, was a burly, loud-voiced, red-faced, straightforward, and not very courteous man, and the way he forcefully (both mentally and physically) threw himself into various communities and conversations was a sign of how he shouldered life.</t1738>
<t1739>He still had his wig and gown on, and he approached his client in such a way that he ended up pushing poor Mr. Lorry aside.</t1739> <t1740>"I am very happy to have saved your honor, Mr. Darnay.</t1740> <t1741>It was a tough case, really tough; but your chances of acquittal were not nonexistent.</t1741><t1742>"</t1742>
<t1743>Holding Mr. Stryver's hand, "I owe you my life – for two reasons," he said.</t1743>
<t1744>"I did my best for you, Mr. Darnay, but surely someone else would have tried to do the same."</t1744><t1745>"</t1745>
<t1746>At this point, it was clear that someone needed to say, "But you did it much better!" and it was Mr. Lorry who said it; it couldn't be said that he was uninterested, but his main goal was to approach the group.</t1746>
<t1747>"Is that what you think?" said Mr. Stryver.</t1747> <t1748>"Well, you were here all day, you must have understood.</t1748> <t1749>After all, you are a businessman too.</t1749><t1750>"</t1750>
<t1751>"I say," said Mr. Lorry, whom the lawyer first excluded and then included in the group, "I say, it would be best if Dr. Manette ended this conversation and we all went home.</t1751> <t1752>Miss Lucie doesn't look well, Mr. Darnay has had a very difficult day, and we are all tired.</t1752><t1753>"</t1753>
<t1754>"Speak for yourself, Mr. Lorry," said Stryver; "I have a lot more work to do.</t1754> <t1755>Speak for yourself.</t1755><t1756>"</t1756>
<t1757>"Speaking for myself," said Mr. Lorry, "and even for Mr. Darnay and Miss Lucie, well, I can speak for all of us, can't I, Miss Lucie?" He fixed his eyes on the young girl, while also glancing at her father.</t1757>
<t1758>Adam, however, was frozen, looking at Darnay with curious eyes; it was a determined look, with eyebrows furrowed in hatred and distrust, but devoid of fear.</t1758> <t1759>Judging by the expression on his face, a lot of things were going through his mind.</t1759>
<t1760>Lucie gently placed her hand on her father's hand and said, "Father."</t1760>
<t1761>Adam slowly turned to his daughter, dispelling the shadows in his mind.</t1761>
<t1762>"Shall we go home, daddy?"</t1762><t1763>"</t1763>
<t1764>Taking a deep breath, "Yes," said the man.</t1764>
<t1765>The friends of the acquitted defendant had dispersed early that night because they thought he would not be released – this impression had been created by the defendant himself.</t1765> <t1766>Almost all the lamps in the corridors were out, the iron doors were closing with a thousand creaks and clatters, and this gloomy place would remain empty until the next morning, until people filled it with gallows, collars, whipping areas, and branding irons.</t1766> <t1767>Lucie Manette walked outside between her father and Mr. Darnay.</t1767> <t1768>A carriage had been called, and the father and daughter got into it.</t1768>
<t1769>Mr. Stryver had left their side as he was going to the cup room.</t1769> <t1770>Another person, who had not joined the group and had not spoken a single word with them but leaned against the darkest corner of the wall, quietly straightened up after resting there for a while and watched until the carriage set off.</t1770> <t1771>Then he went over to Mr. Lorry and Mr. Darnay, who were standing on the sidewalk.</t1771>
<t1772>"Ah Mr. Lorry! So, as a businessman, you can now speak with Mr. Darnay."</t1772><t1773>"</t1773>
<t1774>No one had thanked Mr. Carton for what he did in court that day; there was no one who appreciated its value.</t1774> <t1775>He had taken off his robe, but he did not look any better than he did with it on.</t1775>
<t1776>"If you knew what contradictions exist in the mind of a businessman torn between goodwill and a sense of duty, you would be very amused, Mr. Darnay.</t1776><t1777>"</t1777>
<t1778>Mr. Lorry blushed and said in an excited voice, "You have said this before, sir."</t1778> <t1779>We, who work within a company, do not do anything for ourselves.</t1779> <t1780>We think of the company more than ourselves.</t1780>
<t1781>"I know, I know," said Mr. Carton indifferently.</t1781> <t1782>"Don't get upset, Mr. Lorry.</t1782> <t1783>I'm sure you are as good as the others; even better."</t1783><t1784>"</t1784>
<t1785>Without paying much attention to what Carton said, Mr. Lorry continued, "As a matter of fact, I don't know why you are prolonging this issue."</t1785> <t1786>"Sorry, I'm saying this because I'm older than you, but I don't understand why you are meddling so much in this matter."</t1786><t1787>"</t1787>
<t1788>"Work?</t1788> <t1789>Honestly, I don't understand any job," said Mr. Carton.</t1789>
<t1790>"It's a pity, sir.</t1790><t1791>"</t1791>
<t1792>"I think so too.</t1792><t1793>"</t1793>
<t1794>"If you had understood," said Mr. Lorry, "you would be busy with him.</t1794><t1795>"</t1795>
<t1796>"Oh no, not at all!</t1796> <t1797>–Still, I wouldn't have," said Mr. Carton.</t1797>
<t1798>Mr. Lorry, who was quite angered by the man's indifference, said, "Look here, sir, doing business is a good thing, a respectable thing.</t1798> <t1799>If business brings some restrictions, silences, and obstacles, the noble-hearted young Mr. Darnay knows how to deal with it.</t1799> <t1800>Good night, Mr. Darnay, may God protect you!</t1800> <t1801>I hope your life will henceforth be filled with prosperity and happiness.</t1801> <t1802>There is a cab over there!" Mr. Lorry, who was a bit angry not only at the lawyer but also at himself, hurriedly got into the cab and went to Tellson's.</t1802> <t1803>Carton, who smelled of port wine and did not look very sober, laughed and turned to Darnay:</t1803>
<t1804>"This is a strange coincidence that brought you and me together.</t1804> <t1805>It must be interesting for you to stand here tonight, on these cobblestones, with your colleague.</t1805><t1806>"</t1806>
<t1807>"I don't quite feel like I belong to this world again," replied Charles Darnay.</t1807>
<t1808>"I'm not surprised at all; there's a world of difference between how you were this morning and how you are now.</t1808> <t1809>You don't have the energy to talk though.</t1809><t1810>"</t1810>
<t1811>"I actually don't have the energy for anything.</t1811><t1812>"</t1812>
<t1813>"Why haven't you eaten anything yet?</t1813> <t1814>While those blockheads were deliberating on which side –this world or the next– they would keep you, I had eaten something.</t1814> <t1815>Come, let me show you a good place nearby where you can eat.</t1815><t1816>"</t1816>
<t1817>Carton pulled Darnay by the arm and they proceeded together from Ludgate Hill towards Fleet Street, then passed through a covered area and arrived at an inn.</t1817> <t1818>Here, they were taken to a small room where Charles Darnay could have a nice meal and a good wine to quickly regain his strength; meanwhile, Carton sat at the same table, directly across from Darnay with a separate bottle of port wine in front of him, watching him with a slightly insolent manner.</t1818>
<t1819>"Will you be able to feel like you belong to this mortal order again, Mr. Darnay?"</t1819>
<t1820>"My concept of time and space has been terribly disrupted; but at least I pulled myself together enough to understand this."</t1820><t1821>"</t1821>
<t1822>"This must be an immense happiness."</t1822><t1823>"</t1823>
<t1824>His voice had hardened as he said this, and he refilled his glass; the glass was large.</t1824>
<t1825>"My greatest desire is to forget that I belong to this order.</t1825> <t1826>Neither does it do me any good –except for good wines like this– nor do I do it any good.</t1826> <t1827>In this respect, we do not resemble each other much.</t1827> <t1828>In fact, I have started to think that we do not resemble each other in any respect.</t1828><t1829>"</t1829>
<t1830>Charles Darnay, who was confused by the excitement of the day and saw his presence there with this rough-mannered twin as no different from a dream, did not know what to answer; in the end, he said nothing.</t1830>
<t1831>Carton then said, "Well, now that your meal is finished, why don't you toast to his health, Mr. Darnay; come on, raise a glass to his honor."</t1831><t1832>"</t1832>
<t1833>"To whose health?"</t1833> <t1834>"To whose honor?"</t1834>
<t1835>"Come on, the name is on the tip of your tongue.</t1835> <t1836>It must be, I'm sure it's there.</t1836><t1837>"</t1837>
<t1838>"Miss Manette is in that condition!"</t1838>
<t1839>"Miss Manette, is that you?"</t1839>
<t1840>As Darnay drank his wine, Carton, who was watching him intently, threw his glass over his shoulder against the wall, and the glass shattered into pieces; then he rang the bell to ask for more wine.</t1840>
<t1841>While filling the cup, "Miss Darnay is such a pleasant young lady that you would want to help her into her car in the dark!"</t1841>
<t1842>Darnay, slightly furrowing his brows, responded briefly and concisely; "Yes.</t1842><t1843>"</t1843>
<t1844>"For such a lovely lady to pity a person and shed tears for him!</t1844> <t1845>What kind of feeling is this, I wonder?</t1845> <t1846>Was it worth being judged to receive such compassion and interest, Mr. Darnay?"</t1846>
<t1847>Darnay did not respond to the gesture.</t1847>
<t1848>"When I delivered your message, he was incredibly happy.</t1848> <t1849>He didn't show it too much, but I understood.</t1849><t1850>"</t1850>
<t1851>This reminded Mr. Darnay of how much this grumpy man had voluntarily helped him overcome the difficulties he faced that day.</t1851> <t1852>At this point, he changed the subject and thanked him.</t1852>
<t1853>"Do not feel grateful to me nor show respect," he replied indifferently again.</t1853> <t1854>"First of all, it's nothing; besides, I don't know why I did it.</t1854> <t1855>Mr. Darnay, may I ask you something?</t1855><t1856>"</t1856>
<t1857>"Of course, this way I can at least somewhat repay the kindnesses you have done."</t1857><t1858>"</t1858>
<t1859>"Do you think that I love you?</t1859><t1860>"</t1860>
<t1861>"Really, Mr. Carton," said the other with a strange weariness, "I have never thought of this before.</t1861><t1862>"</t1862>
<t1863>"Now think about it then.</t1863><t1864>"</t1864>
<t1865>"You acted as if you loved, but I don't think you do.</t1865><t1866>"</t1866>
<t1867>"I think so too," said Carton.</t1867> <t1868>"But I admired your understanding.</t1868><t1869>"</t1869>
<t1870>"Come on," said Carton as he reached out to ring the bell, "if you don't mind, I'll ask for the bill and let's part as friends."</t1870><t1871>"</t1871>
<t1872>Carton immediately said, "No objection at all!" and Darnay rang the bell.</t1872> <t1873>"Will you pay the entire bill?" asked Carton.</t1873> <t1874>When Darnay answered affirmatively, he added, "Then bring me another glass of the same wine, waiter, and come wake me up at ten o'clock."</t1874>
<t1875>After Charles Darnay paid the bill, he stood up and wished Carton a good night.</t1875> <t1876>Without responding to this wish, Carton also stood up in a defiant and threatening manner and asked, "One last question for you, Mr. Darnay, do you think I'm drunk?"</t1876>
<t1877>"It seems you've had quite a bit to drink, Mr. Carton."</t1877><t1878>"</t1878>
<t1879>"Am I drunk?</t1879> <t1880>You know I've drunk quite a bit.</t1880><t1881>"</t1881>
<t1882>"Yes, I know."</t1882><t1883>"</t1883>
<t1884>"Then let me tell you the reason for this.</t1884> <t1885>I am a defeated, heavy laborer.</t1885> <t1886>There is no one in this world that I value, and no one values me.</t1886><t1887>"</t1887>
<t1888>"What a pity.</t1888> <t1889>You could have used your talents better.</t1889><t1890>"</t1890>
<t1891>"Maybe so, Mr. Darnay, but maybe not.</t1891> <t1892>Don't rely too much on your sober, sensible state; one never knows what the days will bring.</t1892> <t1893>Good night!</t1893><t1894>"</t1894>
<t1895>This strange man, when left alone, took a candle in his hand and went to the mirror hanging on the wall, and carefully examined himself.</t1895>
<t1896>"Do you love this man?" he muttered to himself; "why would a person love a man who resembles himself?</t1896> <t1897>There is nothing lovable about you.</t1897> <t1898>Oh, come on! What have you changed about yourself in this life?</t1898> <t1899>Seeing the things you've lost and what you could have been might be a good reason to love him!</t1899> <t1900>Just think for a moment if you switched places with him, would those blue eyes look at you the same way they look at him, and would that sad face ache for you with the same compassion?</t1900> <t1901>Come on, just say it openly!</t1901> <t1902>You hate him.</t1902><t1903>"</t1903>
<t1904>For solace, his hand went to the wine again, and in a few minutes, having finished it all, accompanied by the dripping long candle, he fell asleep with his hair spread out on the table, collapsed over his arms.</t1904>
<t1905>V</t1905>
<t1906>Jackal</t1906>
<t1907>In those days, people drank a lot, and most men drank until they were dead drunk.</t1907> <t1908>Time has brought about such great changes in habits that a reasonable explanation of how much wine a man could consume in one night without tarnishing his gentlemanliness would seem like a comical exaggeration today.</t1908> <t1909>In these drinking bouts, the legal community was no less than others; of course, Mr. Stryver, as in the most tedious legal competitions, was never behind his peers in this matter either.</t1909>
<t1910>Mr. Stryver, the favorite of Old Bailey and the trials, had begun to cautiously cut off the lower rungs of the ladder he was climbing.</t1910> <t1911>He was now being called to many trials and to Old Bailey, and they were even eager for his arrival.</t1911> <t1912>Every day, with his red face, he appeared before the Chief Justice in the High Court of Justice, and his head, among all those wigged heads, stood out like a giant sunflower reaching for the sun from among thousands of similar, neatly arranged, and brightly shining heads.</t1912>
<t1913>Once, while discussing Baroda, they had mentioned Mr. Stryver as a talkative, unscrupulous, skilled, and brave man, but they had also remarked that he failed to grasp the essence within a multitude of expressions, which was one of the most striking and necessary skills for a lawyer.</t1913> <t1914>But he had shown significant improvement in this regard.</t1914> <t1915>As he took on more cases, he became stronger in extracting the essence and substance of the matter; even if he stayed up late drinking with Sydney Carton, he would have all his preparations completed by morning.</t1915>
<t1916>The world's most idle and hopeless man, Sydney Carton, was Stryver's friend.</t1916> <t1917>The amount of alcohol they consumed between Hilary Term and Michaelmas was enough to float the king's ship; Carton was always present at Stryver's every trial, looking up at the ceiling of the courtroom with his hands in his pockets; they moved in the same circles and even there, they would extend their drinking sessions until midnight, after which it was said that Carton would secretly, in broad daylight, stagger home like a miserable cat.</t1917> <t1918>Ultimately, followers began to say that while Sydney Carton might never be a lion, he was a very good jackal, offering help and service to Stryver with this humble title.</t1918>
<t1919>The man whom Handa paid to wake him up said, "It is ten o'clock, sir."</t1919>
<t1920>"What happened?</t1920><t1921>"</t1921>
<t1922>"It is ten o'clock, sir."</t1922><t1923>"</t1923>
<t1924>"So what?</t1924> <t1925>Is it ten at night?</t1925><t1926>"</t1926>
<t1927>"Yes sir.</t1927> <t1928>You had asked me to wake you up, remember.</t1928><t1929>"</t1929>
<t1930>"Aha! I remember now!</t1930> <t1931>Very nice, very nice.</t1931><t1932>"</t1932>
<t1933>Although he tried to fall back asleep, the man's noisy stirring of the fire for five minutes turned it into a skillful struggle, and Carton got up, put on his hat, and went outside.</t1933> <t1934>He turned onto the road to Temple, and after pacing twice on the pavement in front of the King's Bench Court and the newspaper buildings, he came to himself and returned to Stryver's office.</t1934>
<t1935>Stryver's clerk, who never participated in such meetings, had gone home, and Stryver himself opened the door.</t1935> <t1936>He was wearing slippers, a loose nightgown, and had loosened his collar for comfort.</t1936> <t1937>Around his eyes were wild, tense, and hardened traces that could be seen in all the freely living members of his class, similar to those in the portraits starting from Jeffreys and evolving with every new form of Art, drawn in all ages where there was a penchant for drinking.</t1937>
<t1938>"You are a bit late, Mr. Memory," said Stryver.</t1938>
<t1939>"I came as usual, just fifteen minutes late."</t1939><t1940>"</t1940>
<t1941>They entered a filthy room filled with rows of books, papers scattered everywhere, and a burning fireplace.</t1941> <t1942>A kettle was steaming on the stove, and on the table amidst the piles of paper resembling a wreck, various kinds of wine, brandy, rum, sugar, and lemon were shining.</t1942>
<t1943>"I guess you've knocked back quite a few bottles, Sydney."</t1943><t1944>"</t1944>
<t1945>"I think I drank two bottles tonight.</t1945> <t1946>We had dinner with my client today; or rather, I watched him eat –same thing!</t1946><t1947>"</t1947>
<t1948>"Drawing attention to your resemblance was a brilliant tactic, Sydney.</t1948> <t1949>How did you come up with it?</t1949> <t1950>When did you first notice it?</t1950><t1951>"</t1951>
<t1952>"I realized he was quite handsome, and I thought if I had a bit of luck, I would resemble this man a little."</t1952><t1953>"</t1953>
<t1954>Mr. Stryver laughed heartily, making his already large belly bounce even more.</t1954>
<t1955>"You and luck, huh Sydney! Come on, let's get to work, let's get to work."</t1955><t1956>"</t1956>
<t1957>The jackal, with a sullen face, unbuttoned his clothes and went to the next room, returning with a large jug of water, a basin, and a few towels.</t1957> <t1958>After soaking the towels in the water and wringing them out lightly, he carelessly wrapped one around his head and sat down at the head of the table, saying, "Yes, I'm ready now!"</t1958>
<t1959>"There's not much going on tonight actually, Mr. Memory," said Mr. Stryver, looking at the papers, cheerfully.</t1959>
<t1960>"How many cases are there?</t1960><t1961>"</t1961>
<t1962>"Only two."</t1962><t1963>"</t1963>
<t1964>"Give the bad news first."</t1964><t1965>"</t1965>
<t1966>"Come on, Sydney.</t1966> <t1967>Good luck!"</t1967>
<t1968>Then, while the lion leaned back on the sofa next to the liquor table, the jackal went to his own table, which was covered with papers and had wine bottles and glasses right beside it.</t1968> <t1969>They both frequently reached for the liquor table but in different styles; the lion usually with his hands resting on his belt, looking at the fire or occasionally shuffling the papers in his hand; the jackal, on the other hand, was so engrossed in his work with a frown and a determined face that his eyes didn't even follow his hand reaching for the glass – thus, he often brought the glass to his lips by feel.</t1969> <t1970>Two or three times, the matter at hand became so intricate that the jackal felt the need to get up and put the towels back in the water.</t1970> <t1971>He would return from his visits to the pitcher and basin with wet towels wrapped around his head in such a way that it was impossible to describe the oddity, and adding his restless solemnity to this, he looked even more comical.</t1971>
<t1972>In the end, the jackal prepared a hearty meal for the lion and placed it in front of him.</t1972> <t1973>After the lion examined it with great care and caution, he made comments by making selections from it, while the jackal assisted him.</t1973> <t1974>After the matter was thoroughly discussed, the lion again put his hands on his belt and lay down, lost in thoughts.</t1974> <t1975>Then the jackal downed a glass filled to the brim to clear his head and prepared the second meal; this meal was also presented to the lion in the same manner, and when they were done, the clock showed three in the morning.</t1975>
<t1976>"Well, now that we've finished, we can have a big glass of punch, can't we, Sydney?" said Mr. Stryver.</t1976>
<t1977>The Jackal took the steaming towels off his head, gave them a shake, yawned, shivered, and agreed with Stryver.</t1977>
<t1978>"You stood very firm in front of those witnesses today, Sydney.</t1978> <t1979>With every question you asked.</t1979><t1980>"</t1980>
<t1981>"I'm always healthy; isn't that right?"</t1981><t1982>"</t1982>
<t1983>"I can't deny this.</t1983> <t1984>Why are you upset?</t1984> <t1985>Pour some more punch and relax.</t1985><t1986>"</t1986>
<t1987>The Jackal grumbled discontentedly and surrendered again.</t1987> <t1988>"Sydney Carton, an old student of Shrewsbury School from years ago, huh?" said Stryver, evaluating him both in his current and past state, nodding his head, "Erratic Sydney. One moment good, the next bad; one day cheerful, the next in a slump!</t1988><t1989>"</t1989>
<t1990>"Ah!" sighed Carton; "You're right! The same Sydney, the same luck.</t1990> <t1991>Even back then, I would do other children's homework and not bother much with my own.</t1991><t1992>"</t1992>
<t1993>"Why then?</t1993><t1994>"</t1994>
<t1995>"Who knows?</t1995> <t1996>This is just how I am.</t1996><t1997>"</t1997>
<t1998>He sat with his hands in his pockets and watched the fire in the fireplace, stretching his legs forward.</t1998>
<t1999>"Carton," said his friend with a condescending attitude; as if the grill in the fireplace was a hearth fueled by endless efforts and the best thing to do for the years of Sydney Carton who had attended Shrewsbury School was to push him, "you've been on the wrong path from the start.</t1999> <t2000>You have neither effort nor purpose.</t2000> <t2001>Just look at me.</t2001><t2002>"</t2002>
<t2003>"Come on, man!" said Sydney, laughing softly and meekly, "don't lecture me now!</t2003><t2004>"</t2004>
<t2005>"How did I come to this state?" said Stryver; "How did I obtain what I currently possess?</t2005><t2006>"</t2006>
<t2007>"You obtained some of it by giving me money to help you.</t2007> <t2008>But none of it is worth you talking down to me or acting superior; you did what you wanted.</t2008> <t2009>You were always in the front rows, while I was always in the back.</t2009><t2010>"</t2010>
<t2011>"I had to be at the front; after all, I wasn't born there either, right?</t2011><t2012>"</t2012>
<t2013>"I wasn't there at your birth, but I think you were definitely born there," said Carton.</t2013> <t2014>He laughed again at this remark, and Stryver laughed too.</t2014>
<t2015>"Before Shrewsbury, in Shrewsbury, and after Shrewsbury," continued Carton, "you were always at the forefront, and I was always behind.</t2015> <t2016>During our student days in the student quarter of Paris, where we took lessons in French, French Law, and the French beauties who caused us trouble, you were always getting somewhere, and I was – nowhere.</t2016><t2017>"</t2017>
<t2018>"So whose fault was this?</t2018><t2019>"</t2019>
<t2020>"Honestly, I'm not sure it's not yours.</t2020> <t2021>While I stood in a corner waiting to rust, you would always strive, struggle, and push things in ways I could never do.</t2021> <t2022>But now, at this hour, just before dawn, talking about one's past is a tedious matter.</t2022> <t2023>Come on, let's change the subject a bit before you go.</t2023><t2024>"</t2024>
<t2025>"Alright, fine!</t2025> <t2026>Let's drink to the honor of the beautiful witness then," said Stryver, raising his glass.</t2026> <t2027>"Did you like this topic?</t2027><t2028>"</t2028>
<t2029>Apparently, he hadn't left, because Carton was bored again.</t2029>
<t2030>He looked at his glass, murmuring to himself, "Beautiful witness."</t2030> <t2031>"I've dealt with witnesses all day and night; who is this beautiful witness?</t2031><t2032>"</t2032>
<t2033>"I'm talking about the interesting doctor's daughter, Miss Manette.</t2033><t2034>"</t2034>
<t2035>"Is she beautiful?</t2035><t2036>"</t2036>
<t2037>"Isn't it?</t2037><t2038>"</t2038>
<t2039>"No.</t2039><t2040>"</t2040>
<t2041>"What are you saying, man, everyone in the courtroom was impressed by him!</t2041><t2042>"</t2042>
<t2043>"What do I care about the admiration of those in the courtroom! Is Old Bailey a place to judge beauty?</t2043> <t2044>She was just a golden-haired baby!</t2044><t2045>"</t2045>
<t2046>Mr. Stryver, "You know Sydney," he said, looking sternly and running his hand over his red face, "you know, I thought you liked that golden-haired baby there, how you rushed immediately to see what happened to her.</t2046><t2047>"</t2047>
<t2048>"Did I run to see what happened?</t2048> <t2049>If a lady, baby or not, faints right in front of your eyes, you don't need binoculars to see it.</t2049> <t2050>I raise my glass to her honor, but I don't admit that she's beautiful.</t2050> <t2051>I'm not drinking anymore; I'm going to sleep.</t2051><t2052>"</t2052>
<t2053>The host, holding a candle, was seeing his guest off down the stairs while the day was coldly peering through the dirty windows.</t2053> <t2054>When Carton stepped outside, the air was cold and melancholic, the pale sky was cloudy, the river was dark and dim, and the whole scenery resembled a dead desert.</t2054> <t2055>The morning wind was driving clouds of dust before it, swirling them in rings, as if the desert sands from far away had risen, and the first sprinkles from this were already beginning to settle over the entire city.</t2055>
<t2056>When this man, filled with burnout within and surrounded by this desert, stood for a moment in front of a silent terrace on his path, he saw the void stretching out before his honorable ambitions, dreams filled with self-sacrifice and determination.</t2056> <t2057>In this beautiful dream, loves and beauties in the city were looking at him from joyful balconies, the fruits of life were ripening in the gardens, and the waters of Hope were sparkling brightly before his eyes.</t2057> <t2058>Not a minute had passed before it all vanished.</t2058> <t2059>Climbing to his room at the top through the houses that seemed to accumulate like in a well, he threw himself onto his messy bed with his clothes still on, and his pillow became soaked with tears flowing in vain.</t2059>
<t2060>The sun rose sadly; nothing that the sun shone upon was sadder than this man, who was devoid of the ability to use his talents and beautiful feelings, unable to do anything for his own benefit and happiness, moreover, aware of this dreadful state and, at the cost of being consumed by this dreadful state, giving up on himself.</t2060>
<t2061>VI</t2061>
<t2062>Hundreds of People</t2062>
<t2063>Doctor Manette's Quiet House was at the corner of a quiet street just beyond Soho Square.</t2063> <t2064>Four months had passed since the treason trial, and the matter had drifted out of the public's interest and memory into the open seas, when Mr. Lorry, on a beautiful Sunday afternoon, walked along the sunny streets from his home in Clerkenwell to dine with the Doctor.</t2064> <t2065>Having come together many times for business, Mr. Lorry and the Doctor had become friends, and that quiet street corner had become a sunny part of his life.</t2065>
<t2066>On this beautiful Sunday, Mr. Lorry had three reasons for making it a habit to walk towards Soho in the afternoon: First, on such lovely Sundays, he would generally go for a walk with the Doctor and Lucie before dinner; Second, on unpleasant Sundays, he had gotten used to spending the whole day with them as a family friend, chatting, reading books, watching outside from the window, in short, spending time with them in this manner; Third, when he had small problems that needed to be resolved in his mind, the Doctor's house was the best place to solve them.</t2066>
<t2067>There was no corner in London stranger than the one where the Doctor lived.</t2067> <t2068>No road passed through there; the front windows of the Doctor's house overlooked a part of the street that had a pleasant air of seclusion.</t2068> <t2069>At that time, there were very few buildings north of Oxford Road, and everywhere was covered with large trees, overgrown wildflowers, and blooming hawthorns; now, none of those fields remain.</t2069> <t2070>Later, instead of wandering around like vagrant poor people without a home, this rural air took its freedom and blew freely in Soho; and nearby, there was a beautiful wall where peaches ripened when the season came.</t2070>
<t2071>In the early hours of the day, the rays of the summer sun would shine brightly on the corner; but when the streets heated up, a shadow would fall on the corner, though it wasn't a very dense shadow, you could see the brilliance just a bit further away.</t2071> <t2072>It was a cool corner, dignified yet cheerful, a wonderful place for the echoing of sounds, like a harbor to escape and take refuge from the angry streets.</t2072>
<t2073>There must have been a calm ship anchored in such a harbor, and indeed there was.</t2073><t2074>The doctor had settled on the two floors of a large and quiet house; many visitors came and went throughout the day, but they made little noise, and at night, not a sound was heard.</t2074><t2075>It was said that a church organ was being made, silver was being crafted, and gold was being hammered by a mysterious giant figure in a building at the back, reached through a courtyard with a plane tree rustling its green leaves; the man had hung a golden arm on the wall of the entrance hall as if he had forged himself out of gold, thus intimidating the visitors.</t2075><t2076>No one had ever seen or heard of the solitary tenant said to live upstairs, or the thick-headed car decorator who was claimed to have an accounting office downstairs.</t2076><t2077>Occasionally, a stray worker would don his jacket and pace from one corner of the courtyard to the other; sometimes a stranger would be seen, and sometimes there would be a clatter from somewhere beyond the courtyard or thumping sounds from the giant man hammering gold.</t2077><t2078>But these were merely exceptions that emphasized the rule that the sparrows perched on the plane tree behind the house and the echoes heard from the corner dominated this place from Sunday morning to Saturday night.</t2078><t2079>Doctor Manette had gained many patients thanks to his old fame and the refreshing of this fame through a story passed from mouth to mouth.</t2079><t2080>His scientific equipment and the caution and skill in his successful works also brought other patients to his door, allowing him to earn as much money as he wanted.</t2080>
<t2081>Mr. Jarvis Lorry had these thoughts in mind when he knocked on the door of this quiet house on the corner on that beautiful Sunday.</t2081>
<t2082>"Is Dr. Manette at home?"</t2082>
<t2083>He was going to arrive soon.</t2083>
<t2084>"Is Miss Lucie at home?</t2084><t2085>"</t2085>
<t2086>He/She was going to arrive soon.</t2086>
<t2087>"Well, is Miss Pross at home?"</t2087>
<t2088>Most likely, she was at home, but he couldn't decide whether Miss Pross would want it to be said that she was at home or not.</t2088> <t2089>"Well, since I'm here," said Mr. Lorry, "I'll go upstairs and take a look then.</t2089><t2090>"</t2090>
<t2091>Although the Doctor's daughter knew nothing about the country she was born in, she seemed to have an innate ability to do a lot with the little she had, which was one of the most useful and pleasant characteristics of this country.</t2091> <t2092>The furniture was simple, but there were many decorative items around; they were not valuable, but the taste and elegance they reflected left a pleasant impression.</t2092> <t2093>The arrangement of the items in the rooms, from the largest to the smallest; the harmony of colors, the delicate variety of small items, and the contrasts they created revealed sensitive hands, tasteful eyes, and a refined appreciation; thus, everything looked very pleasant and also reflected the person who brought them together; so much so that as Mr. Lorry stood looking around, all those tables and chairs seemed to come to life, asking him whether he liked them with their familiar expressions that he had grown accustomed to.</t2093>
<t2094>There were three rooms on one floor, and the doors connecting them were left open to allow air to pass through easily; Mr. Lorry watched this pleasant harmony surrounding him with a smile and walked from one room to another.</t2094> <t2095>The first room was the most beautiful, containing Lucie's birds, flowers, books, easel, desk, and watercolor sets; the second was the Doctor's consultation room, which also served as the dining room; the third room, with its dappled shadows shifting according to the rustling leaves of the plane tree in the courtyard, was the Doctor's bedroom. In one corner of this room stood the shoemaker's bench and tool box, now unused, just as they had stood on the fifth floor of the gloomy house next to the wine shop in a side street of St. Antoine in Paris.</t2095>
<t2096>Mr. Lorry paused for a moment and said to himself, "Why does this man keep these items that remind him of his past sufferings?"</t2096><t2097>"</t2097>
<t2098>"Why are you surprised?" came a reply, causing Mr. Lorry to startle.</t2098>
<t2099>This was the crazy Miss Pross with the very strong hands, whom he first met at the Royal George Hotel in Dover and later saw in other settings, with red hair.</t2099>
<t2100>"I should have guessed," said Mr. Lorry.</t2100>
<t2101>"Amen! He should have guessed!" said Miss Pross, and Mr. Lorry gave up continuing the conversation.</t2101>
<t2102>"How are you?" the woman asked then – harshly but with an air that seemed to try to show she had no grudge against him.</t2102>
<t2103>"Thank you, I am quite well," replied Mr. Lorry in a feeble voice, "How are you?" he asked.</t2103>
<t2104>"There is nothing noteworthy," said Miss Pross.</t2104>
<t2105>"Is that so?</t2105><t2106>"</t2106>
<t2107>"Ah! So!" said Miss Pross.</t2107> <t2108>"I am very worried about my little bird.</t2108><t2109>"</t2109>
<t2110>"Is that so?</t2110><t2111>"</t2111>
<t2112>"For God's sake, say something other than 'really' or I'll go mad," said Miss Pross; her character (unlike her stature) was somewhat stunted.</t2112>
<t2113>"Shall I say it correctly then," Mr. Lorry corrected.</t2113>
<t2114>"My health is not very good," replied Miss Pross, "but it is still better than the other one.</t2114> <t2115>Yes, I am very upset.</t2115><t2116>"</t2116>
<t2117>"May I ask the reason then?</t2117><t2118>"</t2118>
<t2119>"I don't want dozens of people who are not worthy of her to come here to see her," said Miss Pross.</t2119>
<t2120>"Are dozens of people coming to see him?</t2120><t2121>"</t2121>
<t2122>"Hundreds!" said Miss Pross.</t2122>
<t2123>One characteristic of Miss Pross (as with many people before and after her) was that when a word she said was scrutinized, she would exaggerate it.</t2123>
<t2124>"Phooey!" said Mr. Lorry, this was the safest word that came to his mind.</t2124>
<t2125>"I have been living with my little one since he was ten years old, or rather, my little one has been living with me since he was ten and he pays me for it; actually, he shouldn't have to do that, I have tried to manage both myself and him all this time.</t2125> <t2126>This is really very hard," said Miss Pross.</t2126>
<t2127>Even though Mr. Lorry did not fully understand what the difficult thing was, he shook his head from side to side, as if he were using this important part of his body like a kind of magical cloak that fits every situation.</t2127>
<t2128>"There are a lot of people around my beautiful child who are not her equals," said Miss Pross.</t2128> <t2129>"When you started this...</t2129><t2130>"</t2130>
<t2131>"Did I start this, Miss Pross?"</t2131>
<t2132>"Didn't you start it?"</t2132> <t2133>"Who brought his father back to life?"</t2133><t2134>"</t2134>
<t2135>"Ha! If this is what started it," said Mr. Lorry.</t2135>
<t2136>"This wasn't the end, was it?</t2136> <t2137>I mean, when you started this job, it was already hard enough; I'm not saying anything about finding Doctor Manette, of course, but such a daughter is not worthy of him, in my opinion. Still, I'm not blaming her because, under these circumstances, no one can be expected to be guilty.</t2137> <t2138>But for people to come to the Doctor in droves (I could forgive her for that) and try to steal my little bird's love from me is unbearable.</t2138><t2139>"</t2139>
<t2140>Mr. Lorry knew how jealous Miss Pross could be, but he also knew the self-sacrificing creature that lay beneath all that eccentricity – a type only seen among women; these individuals would attach themselves with pure love and admiration, like slaves, to the youth they had lost, the beauty they never possessed, the skills they were never fortunate enough to acquire, and the bright hopes that would never shine upon their own gloomy lives.</t2140> <t2141>Mr. Lorry was worldly enough to know that there was nothing better than this loyal service given from the heart; he knew it was free from any material gain, and he held these individuals in great respect, so much so that in the vengeful plans he concocted in his mind – we all concoct these plans to some extent – he placed Miss Pross in much more favorable positions compared to those ladies who had accounts at Tellson's Bank and were abundantly endowed by both Nature and Art.</t2141>
<t2142>"No one has ever been worthy of my little bird, nor will anyone ever be, except for one person," said Miss Pross; "and that was my brother Solomon, but he made the mistake of his life.</t2142><t2143>"</t2143>
<t2144>The issue was this: as Mr. Lorry questioned Miss Pross, it became clear that her brother Solomon was a heartless scoundrel who squandered her possessions in gambling and left her in perpetual poverty without any remorse.</t2144> <t2145>Mr. Lorry was deeply affected by the strength of Miss Pross's faith in Solomon (seeing his minor mistake as a small flaw), and her value in his eyes increased significantly.</t2145>
<t2146>When they went to the living room and sat down facing each other, Mr. Lorry said, "Now that we are alone and both of us are doing business here, with your permission, I will ask you a question – Doctor, when talking to Lucie, does he ever mention the days he spent making shoes?</t2146><t2147>"</t2147>
<t2148>"Never."</t2148><t2149>"</t2149>
<t2150>"But he still keeps his old bench and tools.</t2150><t2151>"</t2151>
<t2152>"Ah!" said Miss Pross, shaking her head.</t2152> <t2153>"I didn't say she had forgotten those days, though.</t2153><t2154>"</t2154>
<t2155>"Do you think he often thinks about those days?</t2155><t2156>"</t2156>
<t2157>"I think he's thinking," said Miss Pross.</t2157>
<t2158>Mr. Lorry had just begun to say, "Well, imagine that..." when Miss Pross interrupted him.</t2158>
<t2159>"Never dream.</t2159> <t2160>Never have an imagination."</t2160> <t2161>- "Well, let me correct myself; do you think –you probably have no objection to thinking?</t2161><t2162>"</t2162>
<t2163>"It can happen from time to time," said Miss Pross.</t2163>
<t2164>Mr. Lorry continued, turning his gaze, which was shining with a cheerful glow, affectionately towards Miss Pross.</t2164> <t2165>"Do you think that Dr. Manette has any idea about the reason for the suffering he endured for so many years, or perhaps even knows the name of the tyrant who brought him to this state?</t2165><t2166>"</t2166>
<t2167>"Sanmam, ama yavru kuşumun dediğine göre...</t2167><t2168>"</t2168>
<t2169>"What is he/she saying?"</t2169><t2170>"</t2170>
<t2171>"He thinks his father knows."</t2171><t2172>"</t2172>
<t2173>"Don't be mad at me for asking these things; after all, I'm a thick-headed businessman, and you're such a businesswoman."</t2173><t2174>"</t2174>
<t2175>"Thick-headed?" asked Miss Pross calmly.</t2175>
<t2176>Mr. Lorry responded, trying to dismiss this modest adjective, "No, no.</t2176> <t2177>Of course not.</t2177> <t2178>Returning to our matter, don't you find it strange that Doctor Manette, whom we all undoubtedly agree is innocent, has never brought up this subject?</t2178> <t2179>Despite having a professional relationship years ago and being quite close now, he hasn't mentioned it to me, let alone to his beautiful daughter, to whom he is deeply attached with mutual affection.</t2179> <t2180>Believe me, Miss Pross, the reason I'm bringing this up is not curiosity, but genuine concern.</t2180><t2181>"</t2181>
<t2182>"Beautiful! As far as I understand, as far as my mind comprehends," said Miss Pross, softened by Mr. Lorry's conciliatory manner of speaking, "the Doctor is afraid of this matter.</t2182><t2183>"</t2183>
<t2184>"Is he/she/it scared?</t2184><t2185>"</t2185>
<t2186>"I think this is a very understandable situation.</t2186> <t2187>He has a terrible past.</t2187> <t2188>Moreover, he lost his memory because of this.</t2188> <t2189>Since he doesn't know how he lost his memory or how he recovered it, one can't even be sure that he won't lose it again.</t2189> <t2190>Just this alone is an annoying situation in my opinion.</t2190><t2191>"</t2191>
<t2192>This was a deeper comment than Mr. Lorry had expected.</t2192> <t2193>"True," said Mr. Lorry, "it's terrifying even to think about it.</t2193> <t2194>Still, I am not at ease, Miss Pross, I am not sure how right it is for Doctor Manette to suppress all these troubles within himself.</t2194> <t2195>In fact, the reason I brought up this matter to you is because of this doubt and unease within me.</t2195><t2196>"</t2196>
<t2197>Miss Pross, shaking her head from side to side, said, "There is nothing to be done."</t2197> <t2198>"The moment you push a little, it gets worse.</t2198> <t2199>The best thing is to leave him alone.</t2199> <t2200>In short, whether we like it or not, we must leave him alone.</t2200> <t2201>Sometimes in the middle of the night, he gets out of bed, and we hear him above us, pacing back and forth, back and forth in his room.</t2201> <t2202>My little bird then understands that her father, in his mind, is pacing back and forth, back and forth in his prison cell.</t2202> <t2203>She immediately runs to her father's side, and then the two of them continue to walk back and forth in the room together, until her father calms down.</t2203> <t2204>But he doesn't say a word to his daughter about the real reason for his restlessness, and his daughter doesn't even touch on the subject.</t2204> <t2205>In silence, they go back and forth, back and forth together, until the Doctor regains his composure with his daughter's love and support.</t2205><t2206>"</t2206>
<t2207>Although Miss Pross claimed she lacked the ability to imagine, her constant repetition of the words "up and down" revealed that she was in a state of pain that endlessly accompanied a certain sorrowful thought, which actually indicated that she did possess imagination.</t2207>
<t2208>It had been mentioned that the sounds echoed wonderfully in the corner where the house was located; now, as if even the words "walking up and down" had started the echo, approaching footsteps were heard.</t2208> <t2209>"Here they come!" said Miss Pross, who had stood up to pause their conversation; "soon hundreds of people will crowd in here!</t2209><t2210>"</t2210>
<t2211>It was a rather peculiar and privileged corner with its acoustic properties.</t2211> <t2212>In this place that resembled the inside of an ear, Mr. Lorry stood in front of the open window, looking at the father and daughter whose footsteps he heard, feeling as if they would never reach there.</t2212> <t2213>With the fading of the footsteps, not only did the echoes fade away; the echoes of other invisible footsteps came in their place, and as they approached, the others completely disappeared.</t2213> <t2214>The father and daughter finally appeared, and Miss Pross immediately ran to the door to greet them.</t2214>
<t2215>Although Miss Pross was a crazy, red-haired, surly woman, she looked very pleasant when her dear little one came upstairs, as she took off her hat, dusted it with the corner of her handkerchief, folded her cloak and put it aside, and arranged her thick hair with great pride as if it were her own and as if she were the most arrogant and beautiful woman in the world.</t2215> <t2216>Her dear little one also looked very pleasant as she hugged Miss Pross, thanked her, and said she was sorry for causing her so much trouble.</t2216> <t2217>The young girl had said her last words half-jokingly, otherwise Miss Pross would have been terribly upset, locked herself in her room, and cried.</t2217> <t2218>The doctor also looked very pleasant as he watched them and told Miss Pross how much she spoiled Lucie.</t2218> <t2219>However, at that moment, both his speech and his eyes were at least as indulgent as Miss Pross's, and if possible, he would have spoiled her even more.</t2219> <t2220>Mr. Lorry, with his small wig on his head, also looked very pleasant as he watched all this with laughing eyes and thanked his fortune for providing a Home that illuminated his world at this advanced age.</t2220> <t2221>But not hundreds of people had come to see these beauties, and Mr. Lorry looked around in vain to see if Miss Pross's prediction would come true.</t2221>
<t2222>Dinner time had arrived, but there were still hundreds of people missing.</t2222> <t2223>The organization of household chores on the lower floors was under Miss Pross's management, and she had always handled this task admirably until now.</t2223> <t2224>The modest meals were always so delicious, so beautifully served, and the dishes of the semi-English, semi-French cuisine were so nicely prepared that it was hard to find better ones.</t2224> <t2225>Resourceful Miss Pross, whose friendships were based on mutual benefit, had turned the neighborhoods of Soho and its surroundings upside down to find poor French people, from whom she learned all sorts of kitchen secrets in exchange for a few pennies.</t2225> <t2226>She had learned such amazing tips from the destitute children of the Gauls that the woman and young girl working at home almost saw Miss Pross as a sorceress or the fairy godmother of Cinderella – the one who sent them poultry, rabbit, or a few vegetables from the garden and transformed them into whatever she wished.</t2226>
<t2227>Miss Pross only had dinner at the Doctor's table on Sundays; on other days, she always ate at different times either downstairs or in her own room on the second floor – that blue room which no one entered except her little bird.</t2227> <t2228>At such times, Miss Pross would relax considerably, unable to resist the sweet face of her little bird and its efforts to make her happy, making the meal very enjoyable.</t2228>
<t2229>The weather was quite oppressive, and after the meal, Lucie suggested continuing with their wine outdoors, sitting under the plane tree.</t2229> <t2230>Since the world revolved around her, they all moved under the plane tree together, and Lucie helped Mr. Lorry carry the wine.</t2230> <t2231>The young girl, acting as Mr. Lorry's attendant, had settled under the tree a bit earlier than the others, and when they all arrived and started chatting, she continued to refill Mr. Lorry's empty glass.</t2231> <t2232>While they were talking, the mysterious houses around them secretly watched them, and the plane tree whispered something of its own from above.</t2232>
<t2233>Hundreds of people were still nowhere to be found.</t2233> <t2234>While they were sitting under the tree, Mr. Darnay arrived, but he was just one person.</t2234>
<t2235>They greeted Doctor Manette and Lucie politely.</t2235> <t2236>But Miss Pross's head and body suddenly started twitching, and she immediately threw herself into the house, feeling uncomfortable.</t2236> <t2237>She would occasionally suffer from this ailment and had named this condition "foolish fellow fit."</t2237>
<t2238>The doctor was more cheerful than ever, as if he had rejuvenated.</t2238> <t2239>In such moments, his resemblance to Lucie became even more apparent, especially when they sat side by side and the girl rested her head on her father's shoulder.</t2239> <t2240>When the doctor also put his arm around the back of his daughter's chair, it was impossible not to notice this resemblance.</t2240>
<t2241>The doctor had spent the whole day talking with unusual liveliness, jumping from one topic to another.</t2241> <t2242>"Please tell me, Doctor Manette," said Mr. Darnay, as they sat under the plane tree – his question was related to the topic they were discussing, which was the old buildings in London –</t2242> <t2243>"Have you ever seen the Tower of London?</t2243><t2244>"</t2244>
<t2245>"We went with Lucie, but we didn't explore much.</t2245> <t2246>It's definitely a very interesting place, though.</t2246><t2247>"</t2247>
<t2248>"I had gone, as you remember," said Darnay with a smile, but at the same time slightly flushed with anger, "under a different identity and in a position where I had little opportunity to see around.</t2248> <t2249>While I was there, they told me something strange.</t2249><t2250>"</t2250>
<t2251>"What did they tell you?" asked Lucie.</t2251>
<t2252>"While some changes were being made inside, the workers came across an old dungeon that had been built years ago and then forgotten.</t2252> <t2253>The surface of each stone on the inner wall was covered with carvings made by prisoners – dates, names, complaints, and prayers.</t2253> <t2254>On a stone in the corner of the wall, a prisoner who was apparently being taken for execution had carved his final work, that is, three letters.</t2254> <t2255>The letters were carved with a makeshift tool, hastily and with a trembling hand.</t2255> <t2256>At first, they read it as H.</t2256> <t2257>A.</t2257> <t2258>Z.; but upon closer inspection, they realized that the first letter was K.</t2258> <t2259>They could not find any record or information of a prisoner whose name or surname started with these letters, but many empty guesses were made about what this person's name could have been.</t2259> <t2260>In the end, they decided that these letters were not the initials of a name, but a whole word, KAZ.</t2260> <t2261>The ground beneath the writing was examined with great care, and they found the ashes of papers mixed with the ashes of a small leather suitcase or bag under a stone, brick, or a piece of stone flooring.</t2261> <t2262>What the unknown prisoner wrote will never be read, but he wrote something, and then hid it so the guard wouldn't see it.</t2262><t2263>"</t2263>
<t2264>"Daddy," Lucie suddenly cried out, "are you feeling unwell?</t2264><t2265>"</t2265>
<t2266>The doctor suddenly jerked his hand to his head.</t2266> <t2267>His state and appearance greatly alarmed everyone.</t2267>
<t2268>"No, my dear, I'm not unwell.</t2268> <t2269>The rain has started to drizzle, that's why I shivered.</t2269> <t2270>It would be good to go inside.</t2270><t2271>"</t2271>
<t2272>The doctor recovered almost instantly.</t2272> <t2273>The rain had really started to fall in large drops; the doctor showed his hand on which a raindrop had fallen.</t2273> <t2274>But he didn't say a word about the discovery mentioned earlier, and when they entered the house, Mr. Lorry's keen eyes caught, or thought they caught, the same look in the doctor's eyes towards Charles Darnay as he had directed at him in the courtroom.</t2274>
<t2275>The doctor had recovered himself so quickly that Mr. Lorry doubted his keen eyes for a moment.</t2275> <t2276>The arm of the golden giant in the hall.</t2276> <t2277>The doctor stood still under it, saying to the others that he was still not ready for small surprises (perhaps he never would be) and that the rain had caught him off guard, as motionless as he was.</t2277>
<t2278>Tea time had arrived, Miss Pross was making tea accompanied by another bout of "foolish fellow fit" that had descended upon her, but still, hundreds of people had not arrived.</t2278> <t2279>Mr. Carton had just arrived, but he was only the second guest.</t2279>
<t2280>It was such a hot and stifling night that, despite the doors and windows being open, they were thoroughly suffocated.</t2280> <t2281>After the tea was finished, they all moved to a window and began to watch the dense twilight.</t2281> <t2282>Lucie sat next to her father, Darnay sat next to her; Carton, on the other hand, was leaning against a window.</t2282> <t2283>The curtains were long and white, and the wind blowing into the corner of the room was tossing them to the ceiling, making them flutter like ghostly wings.</t2283>
<t2284>"The rain is still falling in large, heavy drops, slowly," said Doctor Manette.</t2284> <t2285>"It is approaching slowly.</t2285><t2286>"</t2286>
<t2287>"Yes, he is coming," said Carton.</t2287>
<t2288>They spoke in low voices, as most people do while watching their surroundings and waiting; just like people always do when waiting for lightning to strike in a dark room.</t2288>
<t2289>There was great commotion in the streets, people were rushing to find a place to take shelter before the storm broke; the corner ideal for echoes, although empty, was resonating with the footsteps of passersby.</t2289>
<t2290>"To be alone in such a crowd!" said Darnay after listening to the surroundings for a while.</t2290>
<t2291>"Impressive, isn't it Mr. Darnay?" asked Lucie.</t2291> <t2292>"Sometimes, I sit here all evening until I drift into dreams, but tonight, with everything so dark and serious, even the mention of the silliest dream is enough to make me shiver.</t2292><t2293>"</t2293>
<t2294>"Tell us too so we can tremble.</t2294> <t2295>Maybe we can understand what it is.</t2295><t2296>"</t2296>
<t2297>"It will not mean anything to you.</t2297> <t2298>I think such dreams are only effective if they remain within us; they cannot be conveyed by telling.</t2298> <t2299>Some evenings, I sit here by myself and listen to all those echoes as if they were the echoes of footsteps mingling with our lives.</t2299><t2300>"</t2300>
<t2301>Sydney Carton, in his usual grumpy manner, interjected, "Then a great crowd is approaching our lives."</t2301>
<t2302>The sound of footsteps was incessant, their urgency growing more and more.</t2302> <t2303>The corner echoed with steps passing one after another; some seemed to come from beneath the window, some from the room; some were approaching, some were receding, some were pausing, some were completely stopping, and all were coming from distant streets, not a single one visible.</t2303>
<t2304>"Do these footsteps come to all of us at once, Miss Manette, or will we share them among us?"</t2304><t2305>"</t2305>
<t2306>"I don't know, Mr. Darnay; I had said that it was a foolish fantasy, but you wanted to learn.</t2306> <t2307>Whenever I indulged in this fantasy, I was always alone, then I imagined that these footsteps were of the people who would enter my and my father's lives.</t2307><t2308>"</t2308>
<t2309>"I am taking these into my own life!" said Carton.</t2309> <t2310>"I am not asking questions, nor am I setting conditions.</t2310> <t2311>There is a large crowd coming towards us, Miss Manette, and I see them –with this lightning."</t2311> <t2312>He added his last words after a bright flash of lightning illuminated him at the window where he was leaning.</t2312>
<t2313>After a violent thunderclap, he added, "I hear them!"</t2313> <t2314>"They are coming quickly, excitedly, and furiously!</t2314><t2315>"</t2315>
<t2316>What it described was the rush and noise of the rain, and this noise drowned out all other sounds so much that he had to fall silent.</t2316> <t2317>Along with this torrential rain, a hefty storm broke out accompanied by thunder and lightning; all this commotion, the series of fire and rain, continued until midnight when the moon came out.</t2317>
<t2318>Mr. Lorry, with his long boots and lantern in hand, accompanied by Jerry, set off to return to Clerkenwell when the large clock of St. Paul's Cathedral struck one in the now fully clear weather.</t2318> <t2319>There were desolate parts on the road between Soho and Clerkenwell, and Mr. Lorry, thinking of robbers, always kept Jerry with him in such situations, but they usually set off two hours earlier.</t2319>
<t2320>"What a night it was, Jerry!"</t2320> <t2321>"At one point, I thought," said Mr. Lorry, "the dead would rise from their graves."</t2321><t2322>"</t2322>
<t2323>"I have never seen anything like this before, sir – and I hope I never do," replied Jerry.</t2323>
<t2324>"Good night, Mr. Carton," said the businessman.</t2324> <t2325>"Good night, Mr. Darnay.</t2325> <t2326>Will we see another night like this together, I wonder?</t2326><t2327>"</t2327>
<t2328>Maybe.</t2328> <t2329>Maybe, with its rush, its noise, they will see the crowd of people coming towards them together.</t2329>
<t2330>VII</t2330>
<t2331>The Monsignor in the City</t2331>
<t2332>One of the most powerful lords of the palace, Monsignor, was hosting one of his bi-weekly receptions at his grand hotel in Paris.</t2332> <t2333>Monsignor was in his private room, the holiest of holies for the worshipping crowd in the other rooms that lacked such a sanctuary.</t2333> <t2334>Monsignor was about to drink his hot chocolate.</t2334> <t2335>He could easily stomach a lot of things, and according to some grumpy types, he was quickly swallowing France as well, but Monsignor's morning chocolate would hardly go down his throat without the help of the cook and the four strong men beside him.</t2335>
<t2336>Correct.</t2336> <t2337>For the Monsignor to be able to bring this fine chocolate to his lips, he required the assistance of four men whose magnificent insignias, reflecting his noble and refined sense of fashion, shone brightly, along with their chief who couldn't breathe without at least two gold watches in his pocket.</t2337> <t2338>One of the men would bring the chocolate container to his high presence, the second would stir and froth it with a small tool made for this purpose, the third would hand the Monsignor his special napkin, and the fourth (the one with two gold watches) would bring the chocolate to his mouth.</t2338> <t2339>Without even one of these men, it was impossible for the Monsignor to drink his chocolate and maintain his lofty honor.</t2339> <t2340>If his chocolate were to be served by only three people, his honor would be stained like a disgrace; if served by two, he would die.</t2340>
<t2341>The Monsignor had attended a dinner last night where Comedy and Grand Opera were charmingly represented.</t2341> <t2342>The Monsignor would attend these dinners most nights, accompanied by a magnificent assembly.</t2342> <t2343>The Monsignor was such a polite and sensitive man that when it came to tedious state affairs and secrets, Comedy and Grand Opera were far more important than the needs of all of France.</t2343> <t2344>Since the same situation was accepted in other countries as well—(for example) in England during the sorrowful days when merry Stuart sold his homeland—it was actually a pleasant situation for France!</t2344>
<t2345>The only noble thought of the Monsignor regarding general social issues was to leave everything as it is, and when it came to specific social issues, his other noble thought was to channel everything to himself – especially power and money.</t2345> <t2346>Whether general or specific, when it came to arbitrary matters, another noble thought of the Monsignor was that the world was created for them.</t2346> <t2347>The prevailing sentence in his order (the only difference from the original sentence was a pronoun, nothing much) was this: "The earth and everything in it is mine," says the Monsignor.</t2347>
<t2348>Bishop Monsignor had noticed that the people's troubles were gradually infiltrating both their public and private relationships, and therefore, he had inevitably been forced to collaborate with the Tax Farmers to resolve matters of both kinds.</t2348> <t2349>Since Monsignor was incapable of handling financial matters in the social sphere, he had delegated these tasks to a Tax Farmer; the reason for entrusting them with his private financial affairs was that Monsignor had been becoming increasingly impoverished after years of all the splendor and wealth.</t2349> <t2350>The Tax Farmers, on the other hand, were wealthy.</t2350> <t2351>For this reason, just before Monsignor was about to don the cheapest attire he could wear, the nun's habit, he took his sister out of the convent and gave her to a Tax Farmer whose family was poor but who himself was very rich.</t2351> <t2352>This Tax Farmer, who had previously been scorned by the nobility, now found himself among those staying in the outer rooms of the hotel with a staff topped with a golden apple, and since he always acknowledged the superiority of the blood running through his veins, he did not object to Monsignor and even his own blood relatives looking down on him with the most arrogant attitudes.</t2352>
<t2353>The tax farmer was a very extravagant person.</t2353> <t2354>He had thirty horses in his stables, twenty-four servants in his house, and six maids serving his wife.</t2354> <t2355>This tax farmer, who did nothing but plunder and raid at every opportunity, was at least the greatest reality among the personalities at the Monseigneur's hotel that day.</t2355>
<t2356>Although the rooms looked pleasant and were furnished with all the decorative objects available at the time, they were actually quite unsuitable.</t2356> <t2357>Compared to the shabby-looking and nightcap-wearing wretches elsewhere (they were not so far apart, as both of Notre Dame's watchtowers, equidistant to both sides, could be seen), it created a rather disturbing environment – of course, it was not anyone's place to say this about Monsignor's house!</t2357> <t2358>Officers lacking military knowledge; naval officers who knew nothing about ships; civil servants who understood no work; the most worldly and impudent clergymen with fiery eyes, drooping tongues, and disheveled lives, none of them were suitable for these jobs, but they acted as if they belonged there and were all part of Monsignor's order, so they were rushed into any job involving money, while they looked at the money they collected.</t2358> <t2359>People were as disconnected from real things as they were attached to Monsignor or the State, and honest people who had set themselves on a true path were as rare as a finger could count.</t2359> <t2360>Doctors who made great fortunes from the marvelous medicines they prepared for imaginary illnesses smiled at the distinguished patients in Monsignor's ground floor rooms.</t2360> <t2361>Planners who produced all sorts of solutions to the minor filth the State was involved in, other than setting out to clean them up from the root, whispered into every ear they could reach at Monsignor's reception.</t2361> <t2362>Faithless Philosophers who reshaped the world with words and built a Tower of Babel from playing cards to scrape the sky were conversing with faithless Chemists who had set their sights on the transformation of metals at this magnificent gathering organized by Monsignor.</t2362> <t2363>In that extraordinary era – and afterwards – gentlemen from the most well-mannered families, known for their indifference to every matter concerning mankind, sat as epitomes of exhaustion in Monsignor's hotel.</t2363> <t2364>These famous individuals had left behind such houses in the beautiful world of Paris that among Monsignor's admirers gathered there – who made up at least half of this polite community – spies would find it difficult to discover a wife among the angels in those houses who, in both manner and appearance, would be fit to become a Mother.</t2364> <t2365>Indeed, these women's connection to motherhood was limited to bringing into the world a troublesome creature who did not even know their mothers' names.</t2365> <t2366>Peasant women would not separate their ragged babies from their sides and would raise them that way; while sixty-year-old charming grandmothers dressed and behaved as if they were twenty.</t2366>
<t2367>The leprosy of unreality had crippled all the people around the Monsignor.</t2367> <t2368>In the outermost room, there were half a dozen privileged men who had felt for the past few years that something was going wrong.</t2368> <t2369>In the hope of setting the country in order, half of these half dozen people had joined a fanatical sect called the Convukionists, and even then, among themselves, they were discussing raging, getting angry, roaring, and remaining indifferent to the matter – thus trying to put a clear signpost to show the Monsignor the path to the Future.</t2369> <t2370>Outside of these Dervishes, three more people had turned in another direction to correct the course with the jargon of the "Center of Truth": the human not from the Circle.</t2370> <t2371>They were saying that it had emerged from the Center of Truth – there was no need for much evidence and it should be prevented from flying out of the Circle, even pushed back into that Center by fasting and sending off souls.</t2371> <t2372>Thus, the conversation with the souls continued – and if it worked, its benefit never became apparent.</t2372>
<t2373>But the good thing was that everyone at Monsignor's grand hotel was impeccably dressed.</t2373><t2374>If judgments were made based on attire, everyone in the hall would be acquitted forever.</t2374><t2375>Curly, pure white, and upright hair, delicate skins preserved and beautified by artificial means, dazzling brave swords, and pleasant fragrances that filled the surroundings were enough to make many things last forever.</t2375><t2376>On the polite gentlemen from the most well-mannered families, small ornaments that jingled lazily as they moved were hanging; these golden chains made sounds like precious little bells; this sound and the rustle of the fabric, a mix of silk, brocade, and linen, caused a commotion in the air that spread to St. Antoine and drove away its ravenous hunger.</t2376>
<t2377>Clothing was an infallible charm and magic used to keep everything in its place.</t2377> <t2378>Everyone seemed to be dressed for a never-ending Masquerade Ball.</t2378> <t2379>From the Tuileries Palace to the Monseigneur and all the court, from the lawyers' chambers to the Judge's Bench, in short, all segments of society (except for the wretched) took their place in this Masquerade Ball; even the rough Executioner was in pursuit of elegance; he was asked to "curl his hair, powder it, wear a glittery coat, high-heeled shoes, and white silk stockings."</t2379> <t2380>Monsieur Paris, following the fashion among his bishop brothers in the provinces, Monsieur Orleans and others, always appeared in this elegant attire during executions at the gallows and torture wheels –the axe was seldom used.</t2380> <t2381>In the year of our Lord seventeen hundred and eighty, who could have predicted that a system in which an executioner dressed with curled, powdered hair, a glittery coat, high-heeled shoes, and white silk stockings attended the Monseigneur's reception would not last long!</t2381>
<t2382>Monseigneur, after drinking his hot chocolate and relieving his four servants from their distress, stood up and ordered the doors of the holiest of holies room to be opened.</t2382> <t2383>What obedience, what flattery, what sycophancy, what lack of pride, and what miserable humiliation it was!</t2383> <t2384>When the body and soul bend this much, there was nothing left to reach Heaven – this must have been one reason why those who worshipped Monseigneur did not mind it.</t2384>
<t2385>The Monsignor passed gently through his rooms, making promises to some, smiling at others, whispering something to a happy slave, and waving to another, until he reached the farthest area.</t2385> <t2386>He went to the Circle of Truth.</t2386> <t2387>At that point, the Monsignor turned around and came back, then shut himself in his temple with the chocolate fairies and was never seen again.</t2387>
<t2388>With the end of the show, the turbulence in the air had turned into a mild storm, and the precious little bells had started ringing downstairs.</t2388> <t2389>Soon, only one person remained from that crowd, and he too, with his hat under his arm and a snuffbox in his hand, slowly made his way out among the mirrors.</t2389>
<t2390>Stopping in front of the last door on his way, he looked towards the temple and said, "I consign you to the Devil!"</t2390>
<t2391>Then, as if shaking off the dust from his feet, he quietly descended the stairs, shaking the snuff from his fingers.</t2391>
<t2392>He was a man in his sixties, elegantly dressed, with arrogant manners, and a face that resembled a delicate mask.</t2392> <t2393>There was a transparent pallor to his face; all his features were distinct and his expression was stern.</t2393> <t2394>His nose had a very beautiful shape, but it was slightly flattened over the nostrils.</t2394> <t2395>The only thing that altered the expression on the man's face were these two flattened points, these two depressions.</t2395> <t2396>Sometimes they would change color persistently, sometimes they would expand and contract like a faint pulse; then they would impart a treacherous and cruel expression to the entire face.</t2396> <t2397>Upon close inspection, it could be seen that the source of this expression was his mouth, which appeared as a line due to being overly horizontal and thin, and his half-closed eyes; yet his face had a pleasant and striking air.</t2397>
<t2398>The owner of the face came down and went out into the courtyard, got into his car, and left.</t2398> <t2399>Not many people at the reception had spoken to him; he had stood in a corner away from everyone; in fact, the Monsignor could have been warmer towards him.</t2399> <t2400>He didn't seem to see anything wrong in people scattering in front of his car and narrowly escaping being run over.</t2400> <t2401>The driver was driving the car as if he were chasing an enemy, and this angry indifference of his did not cause any reaction on the face or lips of the gentleman sitting in the back.</t2401> <t2402>Even in this deaf city and this mute era, from time to time, complaints were heard in the narrow streets without sidewalks that this harsh driving habit of the wild nobles cruelly endangered and maimed the common people.</t2402> <t2403>But very few people paid attention to this situation, and as in many other matters, the miserable populace had to fend for themselves in the face of difficulties.</t2403>
<t2404>With a crazy clatter and a ruthless thoughtlessness that is hard to understand nowadays, the car passed through many streets and turned corners, with women screaming and running away in front of it, and men clinging to both each other and their children as they fled.</t2404> <t2405>Finally, as it turned a corner near a fountain, the wheels jolted slightly in an annoying way and screams rose from the crowd, the horses reared up and lunged forward.</t2405>
<t2406>But a car would not be stopped for such a problem; cars always went on like this and left the injured behind, there was no reason for the opposite.</t2406> <t2407>But the frightened servant got out of the car in a hurry; twenty hands had reached for the reins of the horses.</t2407>
<t2408>"What's the problem?" asked Monsieur calmly, looking outside.</t2408>
<t2409>A tall man with a nightcap on his head had picked up the pile that had fallen between the horses' legs and placed it at the base of the fountain.</t2409> <t2410>Now, covered in mud and soaking wet, he was howling like a wild animal.</t2410>
<t2411>"Sorry, Monsieur Marquis!" said a shabbily dressed and obedient man, "it's a child.</t2411><t2412>"</t2412>
<t2413>"Why is this man making such disgusting noises?"</t2413> <t2414>"Is that his child?"</t2414><t2415>"</t2415>
<t2416>"Excuse me, Monsieur Marquis –unfortunately– yes.</t2416><t2417>"</t2417>
<t2418>The fountain was a little further; the street opened into a small square.</t2418> <t2419>When the tall man suddenly got up from the ground and started running towards the carriage, Monsieur Marquis immediately reached for the hilt of his sword.</t2419>
<t2420>Adam, in a terrible desperation, with his hands raised in the air, his eyes fixed on the man, was shouting, "You killed him!"</t2420> <t2421>"He's dead!</t2421><t2422>"</t2422>
<t2423>A crowd of people had gathered around.</t2423> <t2424>They were looking at Monsieur Marquis.</t2424> <t2425>There was great curiosity and excitement in all their eyes, but not the slightest hint of threat or anger.</t2425> <t2426>They weren't saying anything either; after the first shout, they had fallen silent and hadn't made a sound since.</t2426> <t2427>The voice of the obedient man speaking to the Marquis had come out in a very monotonous and docile manner, in the most obedient way possible.</t2427> <t2428>Monsieur Marquis turned his eyes and looked at them as if they were mice that had come out of their holes.</t2428>
<t2429>He took out his wallet.</t2429>
<t2430>"How is it," he said, "that you can't take care of yourselves and your children, I just don't understand.</t2430> <t2431>Someone always gets in our way.</t2431> <t2432>Who knows how much my horses have been harmed?</t2432> <t2433>Look! Give that to him.</t2433><t2434>"</t2434>
<t2435>He threw a gold coin to the child, and all heads turned to follow the coin as it fell to the ground.</t2435> <t2436>The tall man let out an incredible scream again, "He's dead!</t2436><t2437>"</t2437>
<t2438>Everyone quickly made way for a man approaching him.</t2438> <t2439>The poor man, upon seeing him, rested his head on his shoulder and began to sob uncontrollably, while also pointing to the fountain over which the women were bending motionlessly and moving around with compassion.</t2439> <t2440>The women were as silent as the men.</t2440>
<t2441>"I know it all, I know it all," said the last man who arrived.</t2441> <t2442>"Be brave, Gaspard! It is better for that poor little child to die than to live.</t2442> <t2443>He died in an instant without suffering at all.</t2443> <t2444>If he had lived, would he have had a moment of happiness?</t2444><t2445>"</t2445>
<t2446>"Hey you, you are a philosopher," said the Marquis with a smile, "What is your name?"</t2446><t2447>"</t2447>
<t2448>"They call him Defarge."</t2448><t2449>"</t2449>
<t2450>"What do you do?</t2450><t2451>"</t2451>
<t2452>"I am selling wine, Monsieur Marquis.</t2452><t2453>"</t2453>
<t2454>Throwing another gold coin, "Philosopher and wine seller, here, take this," he said, "and spend it as you wish.</t2454> <t2455>How are the horses?</t2455> <t2456>Are they well?</t2456><t2457>"</t2457>
<t2458>Monsieur Marquis, without bothering to look at the crowd once more, leaned back and was leaving with the air of a gentleman who had accidentally broken something ordinary and paid for it, having the means to do so, when his mood was spoiled by the coin tossed into the carriage, which was jingling on the floor.</t2458>
<t2459>"Stop!" said Monsieur Marquis.</t2459> <t2460>"Stop the horses!"</t2460> <t2461>"Who threw this?"</t2461><t2462>"</t2462>
<t2463>The wine seller looked at the spot where Defarge had stood a minute ago, but at that exact spot, the wretched father was now throwing himself to the ground in despair, and right next to him was a dark-haired, stout woman knitting.</t2463>
<t2464>"You dogs!" said the Marquis, but in a soft tone, with no change in his face except for the spots on his nose.</t2464> <t2465>"I would crush you all with great pleasure and send you to the other world.</t2465> <t2466>If I knew which scoundrel threw this at the carriage and if he were near this miserable carriage, we would have run over him by now.</t2466><t2467>"</t2467>
<t2468>People had been so suppressed and had known for so long what such a man could do to them within and beyond the laws and the difficulties of it that no one could raise their voice, hand, or even their eyes.</t2468> <t2469>Not a single man among them moved.</t2469> <t2470>But the woman who was knitting persistently looked up, and the place she was looking at was the face of the Marquis.</t2470> <t2471>The Marquis could not tolerate the fact that he noticed these glances; after casting his disdainful eyes over the woman and the other mice, he leaned back again and said, "Continue!"</t2471>
<t2472>The car started moving and other cars quickly followed; the Minister, the Planner, the Tax Collector, the Doctor, the Lawyer, the Priest, the Grand Opera and Comedy, and the guests of the Masquerade Ball were shining brightly as they sped along in the cars chasing one another.</t2472> <t2473>To see them, the mice had come out of their holes and had been watching for hours; the soldiers and police mingling with the crowd in these cars were secretly observing them from behind the barrier they had formed.</t2473> <t2474>The father had already taken his small pile and retreated to a corner; the women who had been bending over and looking at the pile under the fountain were now sitting and watching both the flow of water and the guests coming out of the Masquerade Ball – the only woman knitting with the determination of Fate was still knitting, standing out from everyone else.</t2474> <t2475>The water of the fountain was flowing, the water of the river was flowing, the day was turning into night, and many lives in the city were heading towards death as per the order, time and seasons were waiting for no one, the mice had retreated to their dark holes and were sleeping huddled together, while the Masquerade Ball was shining brightly at dinner, everything was flowing in its own course.</t2475>
<t2476>VIII</t2476>
<t2477>Monseigneur in the Village</t2477>
<t2478>It was a beautiful view, the corn was shining, but there wasn't much of it.</t2478> <t2479>In places where there should have been corn, there were barren fields of rye, peas, and beans, and instead of wheat, there were fields of poor vegetables stretching out.</t2479> <t2480>This soulless nature had reflected on the people who cultivated it, as if they were planting and harvesting everything reluctantly – they were in a state of indifference, ready to give up and fade away at any moment.</t2480>
<t2481>Monsieur the Marquis was climbing a steep hill in a traveling carriage (which could have been lighter) driven by four horses and two drivers.</t2481> <t2482>The redness on Monsieur the Marquis's face was not due to anything about himself, that is, not because he doubted his good upbringing, but from an external source beyond his control – the setting sun.</t2482>
<t2483>As the car approached the top of the hill, the evening sun hit the inside of the car so strongly that the passenger inside turned completely red.</t2483> <t2484>"It's about to set," said Monsieur Marquis, looking at his hands, "very soon.</t2484><t2485>"</t2485>
<t2486>Indeed, the sun had descended so low that it set at that very moment.</t2486> <t2487>When heavy chocks were placed on the wheels of the carriage and it began to slowly slide downhill in a cloud of ash and dust, the surrounding redness also disappeared; it was as if the sun and Monsieur Marquis had set together, for when the chocks were removed, not a trace of redness remained.</t2487>
<t2488>At the foot of the hill, in a vast and disordered stretch of countryside, there was a small village; a little beyond this flat area, a church tower, a windmill, a grove for hunting, and a rocky outcrop with a castle used as a prison on its summit were rising.</t2488> <t2489>Mr. Marquis looked at all these objects, darkening as night fell, with the air of a man approaching his home.</t2489>
<t2490>In the village, there was a bad street where everything was bad: a bad brewery, a bad tannery, a bad restaurant, a bad stable where the postal horses were changed, and a bad fountain.</t2490> <t2491>The people were also in bad condition.</t2491> <t2492>They were all poor, and many of them were sitting in front of their houses, chopping thin onions and similar things for dinner, while some were at the fountain washing the leaves and various herbs they had gathered that were edible.</t2492> <t2493>Everywhere bore the poignant traces of the things that impoverished them; according to the magnificent inscription in this small village, taxes to the state, the church, the king, local and general taxes would be paid until there was not a single village left unplundered.</t2493>
<t2494>There were very few children around and no dogs at all.</t2494> <t2495>As for the men and women, their two options in this world were clear – either Life in the small village down by the mill, in the most miserable conditions, or captivity and Death in the prison that covered the top of the cliff.</t2495>
<t2496>The carriage of Monsieur the Marquis, accompanied by a herald going ahead and the driver's whip cracking and curling like a snake in the evening darkness as if Furies had descended upon them, stopped in front of the post office door.</t2496> <t2497>The post office was next to the fountain, and the villagers paused their work to look at it.</t2497> <t2498>He also looked at the villagers and, without knowing what he saw, he perceived in their pain-filled faces and bodies the weariness and exhaustion that would transform into an English superstition about the frailty of the French over a century.</t2498> <t2499>As a gray-haired road worker mingled with the crowd, Monsieur the Marquis fixed his eyes on the obedient faces bowed before him, just as he bowed before the king – the only difference being that these faces bowed not out of sycophancy but out of pain.</t2499>
<t2500>"Bring that man to me!" said the Marquis to the messenger.</t2500>
<t2501>The man was brought in with his hat in hand, and the others surrounded him and paid close attention, just like the people at the Paris fountain.</t2501>
<t2502>"Did I pass by you on the road?"</t2502><t2503>"</t2503>
<t2504>"That's right, Monsignor.</t2504> <t2505>You honored me by passing by on the road.</t2505><t2506>"</t2506>
<t2507>"Both while climbing the hill and at the top, right?</t2507><t2508>"</t2508>
<t2509>"Yes, Monsignor."</t2509><t2510>"</t2510>
<t2511>"Why did you stare at me like that then?</t2511><t2512>"</t2512>
<t2513>"I looked at the man, Monsignor."</t2513><t2514>"</t2514>
<t2515>The man bent down a little and pointed under the car with his shabby blue hat.</t2515> <t2516>Everyone bent down and looked under the car.</t2516>
<t2517>"What man, you pig?"</t2517> <t2518>"Why did you look there?"</t2518><t2519>"</t2519>
<t2520>"Excuse me, Monsignor; the man was hanging onto the chains of the –chock– of the car."</t2520><t2521>"</t2521>
<t2522>"Who?" asked the passenger.</t2522>
<t2523>"A man, Monsignor."</t2523><t2524>"</t2524>
<t2525>"May God punish you!</t2525> <t2526>What's this man's name?</t2526> <t2527>You know everyone around here.</t2527> <t2528>Who was this man?</t2528><t2529>"</t2529>
<t2530>"I beg your pardon, Monsignor! He was not from around here.</t2530> <t2531>I have never seen him in my life.</t2531><t2532>"</t2532>
<t2533>"He was hanging from the chain, huh?</t2533> <t2534>Did he want to choke?</t2534><t2535>"</t2535>
<t2536>"Excuse me, sir, but I thought the same way.</t2536> <t2537>His head was hanging down just like that from there!</t2537><t2538>"</t2538>
<t2539>Adam went over to the car, lay down on his back, lifted his face to the sky and let his head hang back; then, feeling around, he grabbed the hat he had dropped, stood up, and greeted with a nod.</t2539>
<t2540>"What was he/she like?"</t2540><t2541>"</t2541>
<t2542>"Monsignor, this man was whiter than the miller.</t2542> <t2543>He was covered in dust from head to toe, as white and tall as a ghost!</t2543><t2544>"</t2544>
<t2545>This depiction had created tremendous excitement in the small crowd; all eyes, without straying anywhere else.</t2545> <t2546>Were turned towards Monsieur Marquis.</t2546> <t2547>Perhaps to see if there was a place for ghosts in his beliefs.</t2547>
<t2548>"It's good, Aman," said the Marquis, his voice coming out calmly as if to show that such riffraff wouldn't alarm him.</t2548> <t2549>"A thief sneaks into my car and you don't open that big mouth of yours to say anything.</t2549> <t2550>Shame on you! Pull over, Monsieur Gabelle!"</t2550>
<t2551>Mr. Gabelle was the postmaster and also dealt with some tax matters; he had rushed to help with the interrogation with great obsequiousness and had formally grabbed the sleeve of the interrogated man's arm.</t2551>
<t2552>"Come on, step aside!" said Monsieur Gabelle.</t2552>
<t2553>"If this man tries to stay in your village tonight, catch him immediately and find out what he is trying to do, Gabelle."</t2553><t2554>"</t2554>
<t2555>"It is an honor for me to carry out your orders, Monseigneur."</t2555><t2556>"</t2556>
<t2557>"Where is Adam?</t2557> <t2558>Where did that wretch go?</t2558><t2559>"</t2559>
<t2560>The unlucky one had crawled under the car with half a dozen friends, pointing at the chain with his blue hat.</t2560> <t2561>The other half dozen friends immediately pulled him out and, breathless, brought him before Monsieur Marquis.</t2561>
<t2562>"Tell me, you fool, did this man escape when we stopped to remove the block?</t2562><t2563>"</t2563>
<t2564>"Monsignor, the man threw himself down headfirst from the top of the hill, as if diving into a river."</t2564><t2565>"</t2565>
<t2566>"Come on, Gabelle.</t2566> <t2567>Let's go immediately!"</t2567>
<t2568>The half-dozen men looking at the chain were still between the wheels like sheep; the wheels turned so suddenly that the men barely saved their lives; in fact, they had very little to save in this life, otherwise, they might not have been so lucky.</t2568>
<t2569>The car, which left the village in a hurry, stalled on the steep hill shortly after.</t2569> <t2570>They had slowed down to a walking pace, climbing the hill slowly and clumsily amidst the sweet scents of the summer night.</t2570> <t2571>The place of the Furias circling above the drivers was taken by thousands of small gnats that wrapped around their heads like a spider web, which the drivers tried to disperse quietly with the tips of their whips; the servant was walking beside the car; although the messenger trotting ahead was not visible, his voice could be heard.</t2571>
<t2572>At the steepest point of the hill, there was a small grave with a Cross and a newly made large statue of Jesus on it; it was a poorly made wooden statue, as if carved by an inexperienced sculptor from the village, but it was so thin and scrawny that it clearly reflected the sculptor's life – perhaps even his own life.</t2572>
<t2573>A woman had knelt before this statue, which was a poignant symbol of these painful days that had been ongoing for a while but were expected to get even worse.</t2573> <t2574>When the car approached, she turned her head, immediately stood up, and moved towards the door.</t2574>
<t2575>"Ah Monsignor! I have a request from you."</t2575> <t2576>Without changing the expression on his face, Monsignor shouted in an impatient tone.</t2576>
<t2577>"What is it!</t2577> <t2578>What do you want?</t2578> <t2579>You always ask for something anyway!"</t2579>
<t2580>"Monsignor.</t2580> <t2581>For the love of God, help!</t2581> <t2582>My husband, the forester.</t2582><t2583>"</t2583>
<t2584>"So what if your husband is a forester?</t2584> <t2585>All of you have the same problem.</t2585> <t2586>Does he owe someone money?</t2586><t2587>"</t2587>
<t2588>"He had paid all his debts, Monsignor.</t2588> <t2589>He died.</t2589><t2590>"</t2590>
<t2591>"Good then!</t2591> <t2592>He has found peace.</t2592> <t2593>Should I bring him back to you?</t2593><t2594>"</t2594>
<t2595>"Oh no, Monsignor!</t2595> <t2596>But there, lying under a clump of thin grass.</t2596><t2597>"</t2597>
<t2598>"Huh?"</t2598>
<t2599>"Monsignor, there are so many tufts of thin grass around."</t2599><t2600>"</t2600>
<t2601>"Well, what should I do then?</t2601><t2602>"</t2602>
<t2603>The woman looked old but was young.</t2603> <t2604>There was intense pain in her demeanor; she was clasping her veined and battered hands in front of her alternately with a mad strength, and with a tenderness and affection, as if touching a human's chest and as if that person could understand this affectionate touch, she was leaning them against the car door.</t2604>
<t2605>"Monsignor, please listen to me!</t2605> <t2606>Please heed my plea!</t2606> <t2607>My husband died of poverty; many people are dying of poverty and many more will die because of it.</t2607><t2608>"</t2608>
<t2609>"So what should I do then?</t2609> <t2610>Should I feed them?</t2610><t2611>"</t2611>
<t2612>"Monsignor, God is my witness to what has happened, but of course, I wouldn't ask such a thing from you.</t2612> <t2613>My request from you is a piece of stone or wood, with my husband's name written on it, so that we can place it over where he lies.</t2613> <t2614>Otherwise, his place will be forgotten very quickly, and when I die from the same ailment, no one will be able to find this place, and I will probably be lying under another patch of thin grass.</t2614> <t2615>Monsignor, so many people are in this state, their numbers are increasing so rapidly, and poverty has engulfed everything.</t2615> <t2616>Monsignor! Monsignor!</t2616><t2617>"</t2617>
<t2618>The woman from Uşak had moved away from the door, the car had suddenly moved, the drivers drove the car quickly, leaving the woman behind, and the Monsignor, once again accompanied by the Furias, was rapidly closing the distance to his castle.</t2618>
<t2619>The scents of the summer night had enveloped every corner, and these scents, like rain, without missing a single spot, were also rising over the dusty, shabby-looking, tired group standing by the nearby fountain; the road worker, with the help of his blue hat that he never took off his head, was still describing the ghost-like man to the people, as much as they could tolerate.</t2619> <t2620>As they began to tolerate it less and less, those around him dwindled one by one, and the lights flickered on the small window panes; then, as the windows darkened one by one and the number of stars increased, these lights appeared not as if they had gone out, but as if they had been thrown into the sky.</t2620>
<t2621>The shadows of a large, high-roofed house and a multitude of trees hanging over it had just fallen upon Monsieur Marquis; when his carriage stopped and the large gate of his château opened for him, the shadows were replaced by the light of a torch.</t2621>
<t2622>"Did the Monsieur Charles I was expecting arrive from England?</t2622><t2623>"</t2623>
<t2624>"No, Monsignor, they haven't come yet."</t2624><t2625>"</t2625>
<t2626>IX</t2626>
<t2627>Head of Gorgon</t2627>
<t2628>The Chateau of Monsieur Marquis was a very imposing building, with a wide stone courtyard stretching out in front of it, and two winding stone staircases meeting on the stone terrace in front of the main door.</t2628> <t2629>Everything was entirely made of stone, stone balustrades, stone-footed vases and flowers, and everywhere there were stone busts and stone lion heads.</t2629> <t2630>It was as if a Gorgon had cast its gaze around when this place was built two hundred years ago.</t2630>
<t2631>Monsieur Marquis, after getting out of his carriage, ascended the wide and low stone steps accompanied by torches; as the light of the torch pierced the darkness, the loud reproach of the owl perched atop the barn among the trees was heard.</t2631> <t2632>Other than that, everything was so quiet that it seemed as if the torch on the steps and the other torch hanging at the main door were burning in a closed room rather than in the open air.</t2632> <t2633>Except for the sound of the fountain in the stone pool and the owl, there was not a sound; for it was one of those dark nights when, at every hour, the night held its breath, then let out a deep sigh, and then held its breath again.</t2633>
<t2634>When the large door slammed shut behind him, Monsieur Marquis passed through a cruel hall containing some old spears, swords, and hunting knives used for boar hunting; it was becoming increasingly cruel due to the various riding crops and whips, who knows how many peasants, who had met merciful Death, had felt their weight on their backs when their master was angry.</t2634>
<t2635>Monsieur Marquis, without stopping by the larger rooms that were pitch dark, followed his servant carrying a torch up the stairs and arrived at a door in the corridor.</t2635> <t2636>This door led to his private suite of three rooms; there was a bedroom and two other rooms here.</t2636> <t2637>High vaulted ceilings, beautiful floorings without carpets, the hearth irons on the fireplace base used for burning wood in the winter months, and every kind of luxury were in a style befitting a marquis living in this age and land of luxury.</t2637> <t2638>The style of the penultimate member of the dynasty thought to never end – Louis the Fourteenth – was evident in all that rich furniture; but these were also diversified with items seen in the illustrations of the old pages of French history.</t2638>
<t2639>In the third room, a table for two had been set; it was a round room in one of the four towers of the castle, resembling candle snuffers.</t2639> <t2640>The room was small but had a proud atmosphere; its windows were wide open, and the wooden shutters were closed. On such a dark night, only thin black lines and broad stone-colored stripes were visible.</t2640>
<t2641>"My nephew," said the Marquis, looking at the table preparations; "according to what they say, he hasn't arrived yet.</t2641><t2642>"</t2642>
<t2643>He hadn't come yet; actually, they thought he would come with the Monsignor.</t2643>
<t2644>"Ah! Then it is very unlikely that he will come tonight; still, let's leave the table as it is.</t2644> <t2645>I will be ready in fifteen minutes.</t2645><t2646>"</t2646>
<t2647>The Monsignor was ready within fifteen minutes and sat alone at this magnificent and elegant table.</t2647> <t2648>His chair was opposite the window, and just as he had finished his soup and was bringing the Bordeaux wine to his lips, he set the glass down on the table.</t2648>
<t2649>"What was that?" he asked calmly, focusing his attention on the black and stone-colored horizontal lines.</t2649>
<t2650>"Yes, Monsignor?</t2650> <t2651>What did you ask?</t2651><t2652>"</t2652>
<t2653>"A sound came from behind the shutters.</t2653> <t2654>Open the shutters.</t2654><t2655>"</t2655>
<t2656>The shutters were opened.</t2656>
<t2657>"What's there?"</t2657>
<t2658>"There is nothing, Monsignor.</t2658> <t2659>Only trees and darkness.</t2659><t2660>"</t2660>
<t2661>The servant who said this had fully opened the shutters and looked at the vast darkness stretching out in front of him, then pulled back inside and waited for the orders to be given to him.</t2661>
<t2662>"Alright, fine," said the calm gentleman.</t2662> <t2663>"Then close the shutters again."</t2663><t2664>"</t2664>
<t2665>The shutters were closed again and the Marquis continued his meal.</t2665> <t2666>He had just reached the halfway point of his meal when he heard the sound of wheels and put down his glass again.</t2666> <t2667>The sounds approached quickly and stopped in front of the chateau.</t2667>
<t2668>"Ask who has come."</t2668><t2669>"</t2669>
<t2670>He was the nephew of the arriving Monsignor.</t2670> <t2671>In the afternoon, he was a little behind the Monsignor on the road.</t2671> <t2672>Even though he had quickly closed the gap, it wasn't enough to catch up with the Monsignor.</t2672> <t2673>He had learned at the post offices that the Monsignor was a little ahead of him.</t2673>
<t2674>He was told that the meal was ready and he was expected at the table (the Monsignor had requested this).</t2674> <t2675>He came to the table shortly after.</t2675> <t2676>In England, he was known as Charles Darnay.</t2676>
<t2677>The Monsignor greeted him kindly, but they did not shake hands.</t2677>
<t2678>While sitting at the table, he asked the Monsignor, "Did you leave Paris yesterday, sir?"</t2678>
<t2679>"Yes, I left yesterday.</t2679> <t2680>What about you?</t2680><t2681>"</t2681>
<t2682>"I came directly.</t2682><t2683>"</t2683>
<t2684>"From London?"</t2684><t2685>"</t2685>
<t2686>"Yes.</t2686><t2687>"</t2687>
<t2688>"It took you long enough," said the Marquis, laughing.</t2688>
<t2689>"On the contrary; I came directly."</t2689><t2690>"</t2690>
<t2691>"Sorry about that!</t2691> <t2692>I meant to say that it took you a long time to decide to come, not the journey itself.</t2692><t2693>"</t2693>
<t2694>"What kept me from coming," –the nephew paused for a moment– "was that some work came up.</t2694><t2695>"</t2695>
<t2696>"Certainly," said the kind uncle.</t2696>
<t2697>No other conversation took place between them during the time the servant was in the room.</t2697> <t2698>After the coffee service, when they were alone, the nephew looked into the uncle's face, which resembled a beautiful mask, and into his eyes, and broached the subject.</t2698>
<t2699>"As you might guess, sir, I returned to pursue the matter that drove me away from here."</t2699> <t2700>"Because of this, I found myself in unexpected, significant trouble, but this is a sacred purpose, and even if it led me to death, I would not abandon this purpose."</t2700><t2701>"</t2701>
<t2702>"Taking to death?" said the uncle; "Why is there a need to talk about death now?</t2702><t2703>"</t2703>
<t2704>"If this matter brought me to the brink of death," said the nephew, "I am not sure if you would do anything to save me, sir.</t2704><t2705>"</t2705>
<t2706>Upon this, the deep scars on your uncle's nose and the distinct and straight lines on his cruel face took on a sinister appearance; with a dignified hand gesture that reflected his good upbringing rather than being comforting, he objected.</t2706>
<t2707>"Actually, sir," continued the nephew, "if it were up to me, you would do everything in your power to make my already suspicious situation even more suspicious..</t2707><t2708>"</t2708>
<t2709>"No, no, no," said the uncle sweetly.</t2709>
<t2710>Glancing at the Marquis with deep suspicion, the nephew continued, "Even if you don't do it yourself, you will involve your men and, with ruthlessness, somehow stop me."</t2710><t2711>"</t2711>
<t2712>"Look my dear, I told you," said the uncle, leaving a barely noticeable pause between two sentences.</t2712> <t2713>"Please remember what I told you a long time ago.</t2713><t2714>"</t2714>
<t2715>"I remember.</t2715><t2716>"</t2716>
<t2717>"Thank you," said the Marquis, his voice sounding truly sweet.</t2717> <t2718>His voice resonated in the room like the sound of a musical instrument.</t2718>
<t2719>"If you look at it closely, sir," continued the nephew, "the only reason I haven't ended up in prison here in France is because of your misfortune and my good fortune."</t2719><t2720>"</t2720>
<t2721>"I didn't quite understand what you meant," replied the uncle, sipping his coffee.</t2721> <t2722>"Could you speak a bit more clearly?</t2722><t2723>"</t2723>
<t2724>"If your relationship with the Palace had not soured and this stain had not clung to you for so many years, it would have been a simple matter to throw me into a dungeon with a letter bearing the king's signature."</t2724><t2725>"</t2725>
<t2726>"It's possible," said the uncle with great composure.</t2726> <t2727>"I could give you such a trouble for the honor of the family."</t2727> <t2728>Sorry, please!</t2728><t2729>"</t2729>
<t2730>"I was in good spirits, but the Reception two days ago was, as usual, quite boring," said the nephew.</t2730>
<t2731>"If I were you, I wouldn't say I'm in good spirits, my dear," replied the uncle with tremendous politeness; "Don't be so sure about that.</t2731> <t2732>The chance of a good reputation surrounded by the advantages of solitude can influence your fate much more than what you do on your own.</t2732> <t2733>However, there's no point in discussing this matter.</t2733> <t2734>As you said, things are against me.</t2734> <t2735>These small initiatives that help improve the situation, the elegant aids that contribute to the power and honor of families, these tiny favors that disturb you so much are now only obtained through self-interest and sycophancy.</t2735> <t2736>There are many people chasing after these, but (relatively) very few get them!</t2736> <t2737>It wasn't like this before, but France has gone very bad in these matters.</t2737> <t2738>The generations just before us held the rights to decide the lives and deaths of these insolent people around.</t2738> <t2739>Many dogs were taken from this room to be hanged; in the next room [my bedroom], we know a man was stabbed because of the derogatory remarks he made about a girl, yes, about the girl.</t2739> <t2740>We've lost many privileges; there's a new philosophy in effect now and making a claim about this situation these days could cause us serious problems (saying it will cause would be too much, so I say could cause].</t2740> <t2741>The situation is bad, very bad!</t2741><t2742>"</t2742>
<t2743>Mark took a pinch of snuff and shook his head from side to side; he was in a state of the most elegant despair about this new development in the country he was still in.</t2743>
<t2744>"We have made our stance so clear since ancient times," said the nephew in a sad voice, "that there is no family more hated than ours in all of France.</t2744><t2745>"</t2745>
<t2746>"Let's look at the situation this way," said the uncle.</t2746> <t2747>"Hating the upper class is a kind of respect that the lower class shows involuntarily."</t2747>
<t2748>My nephew continued in his previous tone, "In these lands," he said, "the ill-fated respect that people will have for us stems solely and exclusively from fear and captivity."</t2748>
<t2749>"This is a compliment befitting the grandeur of our family," said the Marquis, "and it means we have somehow preserved this grandeur.</t2749> <t2750>Isn't that so?"</t2750> <t2751>Then he took another pinch of snuff and carelessly crossed his legs.</t2751>
<t2752>When the aunt's niece propped her elbows on the table and covered her face with her hands in a pensive manner, the pleasant mask looked at her sideways with a mixture of sharpness, kindness, and intimacy that was much stronger than the indifferent expression worn by its owner.</t2752>
<t2753>"The only enduring philosophy is oppression.</t2753> <t2754>This ill-fated reverence born out of fear and captivity, my dear," said the Marquis, looking at the ceiling, "ensures that as long as our heads are under this roof, the dogs obey the whip."</t2754>
<t2755>This period might not be as long as the Marquis thought.</t2755> <t2756>If that night he were shown a picture of the state of this castle a few years later, or even fifty years later that would pass like a few years, he would not believe that this dreadful ruin, burned to ashes and plundered, belonged to him.</t2756> <t2757>As for the roof he was so proud of, he could see that it was covered in a completely different way – with people whose eyes eternally spewed fire and hundreds of thousands of rifles from which bullets spread.</t2757>
<t2758>"By the way," said the Marquis, "if you won't protect the honor and peace of the family, I will."</t2758> <t2759>"But you must be very tired now."</t2759> <t2760>"Shall we end our conversation for tonight?"</t2760><t2761>"</t2761>
<t2762>"One more minute.</t2762><t2763>"</t2763>
<t2764>"If you want, we can talk for another hour.</t2764><t2765>"</t2765>
<t2766>"Sir," said the nephew, "we made a mistake and now we are reaping the fruits of that mistake."</t2766><t2767>"</t2767>
<t2768>"Did we make a mistake?" repeated the Marquis, with an inquisitive smile, first pointing gently at his nephew and then at himself.</t2768>
<t2769>"Our family; our honorable family, means completely different things to both of us, it seems.</t2769> <t2770>Even in my father's time, we made a lot of mistakes, we harmed many people who came between us and our pleasures.</t2770> <t2771>But why am I talking about my father's time, isn't it your time too?</t2771> <t2772>Is it possible to distinguish my father from his twin brother, his co-heir, his successor?</t2772><t2773>"</t2773>
<t2774>"Death did this already!" said the Marquis.</t2774>
<t2775>"And left me within this terrible system," replied the nephew, "the responsibility is on me but I am powerless; I am trying to fulfill the last wish that fell from my dear mother's lips and to heed the last look in her eyes, as if she were asking me to show mercy and correct the wrongs, but now I am in the agony of searching for support and strength in vain.</t2775><t2776>"</t2776>
<t2777>"If you are looking for them here, my nephew," said the Marquis, touching his nephew's chest with his index finger – they were now standing by the fireplace – "you can be sure you will be waiting forever.</t2777><t2778>"</t2778>
<t2779>Mark stood where he was, silently watching his nephew with a snuffbox in his hand, while every line on his clean white face had deepened cruelly, cunningly, and almost uniformly.</t2779>
<t2780>Once again, he touched his nephew's chest with his index finger, as if his finger were the sharp tip of a small sword that delicately and skillfully etched a mark on his body, and said: "My dear, I will continue this system I am in until my last breath."</t2780><t2781>'"</t2781>
<t2782>After saying this, he took one last big pinch of snuff and put the box in his pocket.</t2782>
<t2783>Then, after ringing the small bell on the table, he added, "It is best to be reasonable and accept your drawn fate.</t2783> <t2784>However, I see that you have lost this, Monsieur Charles.</t2784><t2785>"</t2785>
<t2786>"All this property and France are lost to me," said the nephew sadly, "I have given up on all of them."</t2786><t2787>"</t2787>
<t2788>"Are these yours?</t2788> <t2789>It might be France, okay, but this property, wealth?</t2789> <t2790>Maybe it's unnecessary to even talk about it, but do you think it's yours?</t2790><t2791>"</t2791>
<t2792>"I did not intend to make such a claim.</t2792> <t2793>But if it passes from you to me, then tomorrow...</t2793><t2794>"</t2794>
<t2795>"I hope that such a thing would not be possible.</t2795><t2796>"</t2796>
<t2797>"Well, what about twenty years from now...</t2797><t2798>"</t2798>
<t2799>"Ah, how much you have honored me," said the Marquis; "still, I would prefer this assumption to be true."</t2799><t2800>"</t2800>
<t2801>"I would give up everything and live in a different way and in a different place.</t2801> <t2802>Leaving is not that difficult.</t2802> <t2803>What meaning do these have amidst all this misery and ruin?</t2803><t2804>"</t2804>
<t2805>"Ha!" said the Marquis, glancing around the luxurious room.</t2805>
<t2806>"It looks pleasing to the eye here, but when viewed as a whole, under this sky, in the daylight, it is actually a tower where waste, mismanagement, tyranny, debt, mortgage, oppression, hunger, nakedness, and pain are piled up."</t2806><t2807>"</t2807>
<t2808>"Ha!" said the Marquis again, with a satisfied demeanor.</t2808>
<t2809>"If one day these lands become mine, I would entrust them to skillful hands that would gradually liberate them from the weight that has driven them to collapse (if such a thing is possible), so that the people who cannot leave here and have long been at the end of their endurance, or rather the generations that come after them, would suffer less, but this place is not for me.</t2809> <t2810>There is a curse here and over all these lands.</t2810><t2811>"</t2811>
<t2812>"And you?" asked the uncle.</t2812> <t2813>"Forgive my curiosity, but is your intention to live according to this new philosophy?</t2813><t2814>"</t2814>
<t2815>"I will do what my fellow citizens, even the noble ones, will have to do one day to sustain their lives – I will work.</t2815><t2816>"</t2816>
<t2817>"In England, for example?"</t2817>
<t2818>"Yes.</t2818> <t2819>There, no harm will come to me for our family's honor, sir.</t2819> <t2820>Since I will not bear this name anywhere else, there will be no problem in other countries either.</t2820><t2821>"</t2821>
<t2822>With the ringing of the bell, the lights in the adjacent bedroom turned on.</t2822> <t2823>The bright lights of the room reached the place where they were talking.</t2823> <t2824>The Marquis looked that way and listened to the receding footsteps of his servant.</t2824>
<t2825>Then, turning his cold face towards his nephew with a smile, he said, "England seems very appealing to you, of course things went well there."</t2825>
<t2826>"As I said, I am grateful to you, sir, for things going smoothly.</t2826> <t2827>Other than that, it is a Sanctuary for me.</t2827><t2828>"</t2828>
<t2829>"According to what they say, that is, according to the arrogant English, it was a Shelter for many people.</t2829> <t2830>Do you know any other citizen who took refuge there?</t2830> <t2831>A doctor or someone?</t2831><t2832>"</t2832>
<t2833>"Yes.</t2833><t2834>"</t2834>
<t2835>"Does he have a daughter?"</t2835><t2836>"</t2836>
<t2837>"Var.</t2837><t2838>"</t2838>
<t2839>"It means," said the Marquis.</t2839> <t2840>"You are very tired now.</t2840> <t2841>Come on, good night!</t2841><t2842>"</t2842>
<t2843>While bowing his head gracefully, the Marquis had a mysterious expression on his smiling face, which added a mysterious air to his words that did not escape his nephew's eyes and ears.</t2843> <t2844>Moreover, his eyes, which were thin and straight lines, along with his thin and straight lips and the mark on his nose, were twisted with a devilish charm of mockery.</t2844>
<t2845>"That's right," repeated the Marquis.</t2845> <t2846>"A Doctor with a daughter.</t2846> <t2847>Yes.</t2847> <t2848>So this is what started your new philosophy!</t2848> <t2849>You must be very tired.</t2849> <t2850>Well, good night!</t2850><t2851>"</t2851>
<t2852>Questioning the uncle's face was harder than questioning the stone faces in the castle's garden.</t2852> <t2853>The nephew looked at the Marquis in vain as he walked out the door.</t2853>
<t2854>"Good night!" said the uncle.</t2854> <t2855>"I am glad we will see each other again tomorrow morning.</t2855> <t2856>Rest now!</t2856> <t2857>Light the way for the gentleman who will be my nephew so he can go to his room! –and if you can manage it, even closer," he muttered to himself, then rang the small bell again to call the servant to his own room.</t2857>
<t2858>The servant had come and gone, and Monsieur Marquis, on that warm, still night, was pacing back and forth in his room in his loose nightgown, slowly preparing himself for sleep.</t2858> <t2859>As he walked around the room, his soft slippers made no sound, and he moved like a graceful tiger – he resembled an unashamed, incorrigible, magical marquis, constantly transforming either into a tiger or back from one, just like in fairy tales.</t2859>
<t2860>Accompanied by a flood of fragmented images from the journey he took that day, he advanced from one end to the other in the opulent bedroom; their arduous climb up the hill at sunset, the setting sun, their descent from the hill, the mill, the prison atop the cliff, the village in the valley, the villagers at the fountain, and the road worker with the blue hat showing the chain under the car.</t2860> <t2861>That fountain reminded him of the fountain in Paris, the small heap lying on the steps, the women gathered around it, and the tall man raising his arms and shouting "He's dead!"</t2861>
<t2862>"Oh, I feel a bit refreshed," said Monsieur Marquis, "I can lie down now.</t2862><t2863>"</t2863>
<t2864>She covered the thin canopy surrounding the bed, leaving only the lamp burning on top of the large fireplace, and as she fell asleep, she heard the night break its silence with a deep sigh.</t2864>
<t2865>For three intense hours, the stone faces on the outer walls of the building stared into the dark night with blind eyes; for three intense hours, the horses in the stables neighed, the dogs barked, and the owl hooted, making sounds that bore no resemblance to the traditional sounds depicted by poets.</t2865> <t2866>But it is customary for such creatures to behave unexpectedly.</t2866>
<t2867>For three intense hours, the stone lions and human faces in the castle stared at the night with blind eyes.</t2867> <t2868>Dead darkness covered everywhere, dead darkness had added its own tranquility to the silent dust of the roads.</t2868> <t2869>The place where the dead were buried had become so cramped that the mounds covered with sparse grass could no longer be distinguished from one another; for some unknown reason, the figure on the Cross had been taken down by someone.</t2869> <t2870>In the village, tax collectors and taxpayers had fallen into a deep sleep.</t2870> <t2871>In their dreams, they were probably seeing a feast table, as often happens to those who suffer from hunger, or the kind of comfort and peace that slaves and oxen plowing the fields might see; thus, while the scrawny inhabitants of the region slept soundly, they were filling their bellies and gaining their freedom.</t2871>
<t2872>The fountain in the village flowed for three intense hours, unseen and unheard by anyone, and likewise, the fountain in the castle dripped unnoticed and unheard – both melted away like minutes flowing in the Fountain of Time.</t2872> <t2873>Then, with the dawn of the new day, the gray waters of both began to appear like ghosts, and the eyes of the stone faces in the castle opened.</t2873>
<t2874>Slowly, the surroundings brightened and finally the sun touched the tops of the motionless trees, pouring its light down from above.</t2874> <t2875>In the redness, the water of the castle's fountain had turned the color of blood, and the stone faces had become bright red.</t2875> <t2876>Birds were singing cheerful songs loudly, and on the weather-worn sill of Monsieur Marquis's bedroom's large window, a small bird was singing its sweetest song with all its might.</t2876> <t2877>The nearest stone face, with its mouth wide open, seemed to be staring at it in astonishment, as if in horror.</t2877>
<t2878>The sun was now directly overhead and the village had come to life.</t2878> <t2879>Window shutters were opened, the bolts of rickety doors were drawn, and people shivered as they poured out into the fresh and crisp –but cold– morning air.</t2879> <t2880>Then the villagers' rarely lightened, arduous hustle and bustle began.</t2880> <t2881>Some ran to the fountain; some to the fields; on one side, a group of men and women started digging and tilling the soil; on the other side, another group of men and women rushed to tend to the miserable animals and to take the emaciated cows to graze in the meadows they could find along the roadside.</t2881> <t2882>A few people were kneeling in the church, praying before the Cross, while the cows outside were searching for breakfast grass at their feet.</t2882>
<t2883>The castle, in accordance with its nobility, woke up later but gradually and confidently.</t2883> <t2884>First, the spears and knives used in boar hunting, which were kept in a separate section, turned red; then they shone sharply under the morning sun; following that, doors and windows were flung wide open, and the horses in the stables turned their heads towards the door to look at the incoming light and fresh air, leaves sparkled and rustled on the iron-barred doors, dogs impatiently jumped, pulling their chains quickly to break free.</t2884>
<t2885>All these trivial events were part of everyday life and were repeated every morning.</t2885> <t2886>But neither the ringing of the castle's big bell, nor the hustle on the stairs, nor the frantic people on the terrace, nor the rising footsteps from around, nor the hurried saddling and riding of the horses could be considered as usual matters, of course.</t2886>
<t2887>What wind had conveyed this rush to the gray-haired road worker, who had already started working, having placed his bundle, which contained food that even a crow wouldn't deign to peck at (there wasn't much), on a pile of stones on the hill beyond the village?</t2887> <t2888>Had the birds, while sowing the seeds of fortune, dropped a piece of it on him?</t2888> <t2889>For some unknown reason, the road worker, on that stifling morning, as if his life depended on it, ran nonstop down the hill to the fountain, covered in dust and dirt up to his knees.</t2889>
<t2890>The entire village had gathered at the fountain, standing there with their spirits low, whispering to each other, but apart from a serious curiosity and astonishment, there was no other emotion on their faces.</t2890> <t2891>The cows that had been taken out to graze were hurriedly brought back and tied wherever they could be tied, either staring blankly around or lying down and chewing cud, but there was nothing in their mouths worth the trouble they had gone through from their interrupted stroll.</t2891> <t2892>Some people from the chateau, some from the post office, and all the tax collectors had armed themselves to some extent and were gathered on the other side of the small street, waiting aimlessly, which was quite worrisome.</t2892> <t2893>The road worker had already plunged into a group of fifty people and was hitting his chest with his blue cap.</t2893> <t2894>What did all this signify?</t2894> <t2895>Moreover, what did it signify that Monsieur Gabelle was being hastily pulled by a servant on horseback, and that this person, like a new adaptation of the German Lenore ballad, was galloping away (despite the horse being heavily loaded)?</t2895>
<t2896>All this indicated that one more stone face had been added to the many in the castle.</t2896>
<t2897>Gorgo had looked at the building again at night and added a stone face to replace the missing one; it was the stone face the building had been waiting for about two hundred years.</t2897>
<t2898>This face was now lying on Monsieur Marquis's pillow.</t2898> <t2899>After a sudden shock and anger, it was like a beautiful mask turned to stone.</t2899> <t2900>There was a knife plunged into the heart of this stone figure.</t2900> <t2901>A paper with the following words scribbled on it was wrapped around the hilt:</t2901>
<t2902>Take this to his grave immediately!</t2902>
<t2903>This was written by Jacques</t2903>
<t2904>X</t2904>
<t2905>Two Words</t2905>
<t2906>About twelve months had passed, and Mr. Charles Darnay had settled in England as a French teacher specializing in French Literature.</t2906> <t2907>If it were this age, he would be a Professor; in that age, he was a private tutor.</t2907> <t2908>He worked with young gentlemen who had the time and interest to learn a living language spoken all around the world, and he had developed tastes for knowledge and appreciation in this field.</t2908> <t2909>Additionally, he could write beautifully and translate these writings into English in an elegant manner.</t2909> <t2910>At that time, finding experts in this field was not easy; the Princes of the past and the Kings of the future were not included in the Teacher class, and no poor noble had emerged from Tellson's ledgers to become a cook or a carpenter.</t2910> <t2911>Young Mr. Darnay quickly gained a reputation and attracted attention as a teacher who both entertained and taught useful things to his students with his skills, and as a meticulous translator who added much more than just vocabulary knowledge to translations.</t2911> <t2912>Due to the conditions of the country and the growing interest, he became known by many people.</t2912> <t2913>Thus, with great determination and unending efforts, he achieved prosperity.</t2913>
<t2914>Previously, in London, he had neither hoped to walk on golden pavements nor to lie on beds covered with rose petals; if his ambitions had been so high, he wouldn't have been this successful anyway.</t2914> <t2915>He had wanted to do a job, and he found it, did it, and even became the best among those who did it.</t2915> <t2916>This was the real wealth.</t2916>
<t2917>He spent a portion of his time in Cambridge, where, in his work with students, he was like a kind of smuggler who was tolerated for engaging in the contraband trade of European languages instead of passing Greek and Latin through customs.</t2917> <t2918>He spent the rest of his time in London.</t2918>
<t2919>Men on earth have always walked the same path—from the days of eternal summer in paradise to the winter days in today's sinful lands—on the path of Charles Darnay, in pursuit of a woman's love.</t2919>
<t2920>Since that hour when his life was in danger, he had loved Lucie Manette.</t2920> <t2921>Until he met her at the edge of the grave dug for him, Charles had never heard a voice as sweet and pleasant as Lucie's, nor had he encountered a face as kind and beautiful as hers.</t2921> <t2922>But he had not yet said anything to her about it; a year had passed since the murder committed in that desolate stone chateau –which had turned into a mist within a dream– far beyond the rising waters and long dusty roads, yet Charles Darnay had not uttered a single word to Lucie Manette about his feelings.</t2922>
<t2923>There were clear reasons for this, and he knew them very well.</t2923> <t2924>Again on a summer day, in London, late on his return from work at the school, he turned to the quiet corner in Soho with the hope of finding an opportunity to share his thoughts with Doctor Manette.</t2924> <t2925>It was a summer evening, and he knew that Lucie had gone out with Miss Pross.</t2925>
<t2926>He found the Doctor reading a book in a chair by the window.</t2926> <t2927>He was gradually regaining the strength that had supported him during his painful old days and had also intensified those pains.</t2927> <t2928>He was now an extremely energetic man, capable of making sound decisions and possessing the determination and strength to implement them.</t2928> <t2929>Just as he had initially experienced difficulties with the other skills he had regained, this returning energy sometimes disrupted his balance and routine, but it wasn't too bothersome and its frequency was decreasing day by day.</t2929>
<t2930>He works a lot, sleeps little, easily overcomes all that fatigue, and derives great happiness from all of it.</t2930> <t2931>Now, seeing Charles Darnay enter the room, he put the book he was reading aside and extended his hand.</t2931>
<t2932>"Charles Darnay! I am glad to see you.</t2932> <t2933>We have been expecting you for three or four days.</t2933> <t2934>Yesterday Mr. Stryver and Sydney Carton were here, both of them thought you would come earlier.</t2934><t2935>"</t2935>
<t2936>"I am grateful for their concern," she replied, with a somewhat cold demeanor, but this coldness was not directed at the Doctor, but at them.</t2936> <t2937>"Miss Manette...</t2937><t2938>"</t2938>
<t2939>"Good," said the Doctor briefly; "your arrival will make us all happy.</t2939> <t2940>He had gone out for some errands related to the house, but he will be back soon.</t2940><t2941>"</t2941>
<t2942>"Doctor Manette, I knew that your daughter was not at home.</t2942> <t2943>I waited for a moment when she was not at home to be able to talk to you.</t2943><t2944>"</t2944>
<t2945>There was absolute silence.</t2945>
<t2946>"Well?" said the Doctor with obvious tension.</t2946> <t2947>"Pull up a chair and let's talk.</t2947><t2948>"</t2948>
<t2949>Charles immediately pulled the chair: but starting to talk was not that easy.</t2949>
<t2950>"Doctor Manette, for the past one and a half years," he began shortly, "the closeness I have felt from you all has made me very happy, and therefore, the matter I will touch upon shortly...</t2950><t2951>"</t2951>
<t2952>When the doctor reached out his hand to stop him, Charles immediately fell silent.</t2952> <t2953>After holding his hand like that for a while, he spoke as he pulled it back:</t2953>
<t2954>"Is it about Lucie?"</t2954>
<t2955>"Yes.</t2955><t2956>"</t2956>
<t2957>"Talking about him is always difficult for me.</t2957> <t2958>Hearing someone mention him in that tone of voice is even harder, Charles Darnay.</t2958><t2959>"</t2959>
<t2960>Darnay said respectfully, "This tone of voice contains great admiration, sincere respect, and deep affection, Doctor Manette!"</t2960>
<t2961>Before Lucie's father responded, there was absolute silence again.</t2961>
<t2962>"I believe.</t2962> <t2963>I am sure of your honesty; I believe in you.</t2963><t2964>"</t2964>
<t2965>It was so obvious that the Doctor's tension stemmed from his reluctance to discuss this matter that Charles Darnay hesitated.</t2965>
<t2966>"Shall I continue, sir?</t2966><t2967>"</t2967>
<t2968>Another silence.</t2968>
<t2969>"Please, go ahead.</t2969><t2970>"</t2970>
<t2971>"Even if you do not know how sincerely I say these things, how genuine my feelings are, the secret in my heart, and the hopes, fears, and excitements overflowing from this heart, you can guess what I am going to say.</t2971> <t2972>Dear Doctor Manette, I love your daughter with all my heart, sincerely, without expecting anything in return, and with great devotion.</t2972> <t2973>If there is love in the world, it is the feeling I have for your daughter.</t2973> <t2974>You have loved once too; let the love you experienced be the interpreter of my feelings!</t2974><t2975>"</t2975>
<t2976>The doctor was sitting with his head turned to the other side, his eyes cast down to the ground.</t2976> <t2977>As soon as he heard the last words spoken by Charles Darnay, he reached out his hand again and exclaimed:</t2977>
<t2978>"Please, sir!</t2978> <t2979>Don't say that!</t2979> <t2980>I beg you, don't mention that topic!"</t2980>
<t2981>There was such great pain in the Doctor's cry that even when he stopped, Charles Darnay's ears rang for a long time.</t2981> <t2982>As he moved his outstretched hand, it was as if he was begging Darnay to be silent.</t2982> <t2983>Charles comprehended the situation and remained silent for a while.</t2983>
<t2984>A few minutes later, "Forgive me," said the Doctor in a soft voice.</t2984> <t2985>"I have no doubt that you love Lucie; therefore, you can be at ease.</t2985><t2986>"</t2986>
<t2987>The doctor turned to Darnay in his chair, but he still did not look at his face, not lifting his eyes from the ground.</t2987> <t2988>His chin had fallen into his hands, and his white hair was shading his face.</t2988>
<t2989>"Did you talk to Lucie?</t2989><t2990>"</t2990>
<t2991>"No.</t2991><t2992>"</t2992>
<t2993>"Well, did you write to him?</t2993><t2994>"</t2994>
<t2995>"No, not at all.</t2995><t2996>"</t2996>
<t2997>"It would be unfair not to see that you displayed this dedication thinking of his father.</t2997> <t2998>As his father, I thank you.</t2998><t2999>"</t2999>
<t3000>He reached out his hand, but he was still avoiding eye contact.</t3000>
<t3001>"I know," said Darnay respectfully, "as someone who has spent a long time with you, how could I not know how special and touching the love between you and Miss Manette is, Doctor Manette?</t3001> <t3002>This love has developed under such circumstances that the affection between any other father and daughter pales in comparison to yours.</t3002> <t3003>I know that this woman, who loves you and feels responsible for you, also carries a love and trust from her infancy in her heart, Doctor Manette –how could I not know this?</t3003> <t3004>Of course, I know that, due to her growing up without a mother and father in the past, and now, because of her temperament and the longing and attachment brought by the years she spent apart from you, she has devoted herself to you with great loyalty and enthusiasm.</t3004> <t3005>I know very well that even if you were to reunite with her in the afterlife, she would not appear more sacred than she does now.</t3005> <t3006>When she embraces you, I know that the hands wrapping around your neck are simultaneously those of a baby, a young girl, and a mother.</t3006> <t3007>I also know that, while loving you, she sees and loves her mother at her own age, sees and loves you at my age, loves her mother with a broken heart, loves you with that terrible trial and your joyful return to life.</t3007> <t3008>I have seen this every moment since the first day I stepped into this house.</t3008><t3009>"</t3009>
<t3010>Lucie's father sat silently with his face turned downward.</t3010> <t3011>His breathing had quickened a bit, but he had suppressed all other signs of excitement.</t3011>
<t3012>"Dear Doctor Manette, knowing this situation, always seeing this sacred light upon your daughter and you, I have always restrained myself as much as a person can.</t3012> <t3013>With my love for her –even with my love– if I were to come between you, I felt, and still feel, that I would add something not as good to what you have experienced.</t3013> <t3014>But I love her.</t3014> <t3015>God is my witness that I love her!</t3015><t3016>"</t3016>
<t3017>The doctor replied in a sorrowful voice, "I believe you."</t3017> <t3018>"I had already thought about these things before.</t3018> <t3019>I believe you.</t3019><t3020>"</t3020>
<t3021>"But do not think," said Darnay, hearing the reproach in the Doctor's sorrowful voice, "that if one day fate smiles upon me and I attain the happiness of marrying your daughter, I will separate you from each other.</t3021> <t3022>What I am saying now will be valid then as well.</t3022> <t3023>Even though such a baseness is not possible, I know this.</t3023> <t3024>Still, if there were such a possibility, hidden in a corner of my mind and heart, that could emerge years later – impossible, but if there were – I could not shake this honorable hand now.</t3024><t3025>"</t3025>
<t3026>While speaking, she had placed her hand on the Doctor's hand.</t3026>
<t3027>"No, dear Doctor Manette.</t3027> <t3028>Like you, I was voluntarily exiled from France; like you, I fled from its madness, oppressions, and sufferings; just like you, I am trying to survive away from there through my own efforts and I believe that happy days await me; my only wish is to share your fate, your life, and your home and to honor you until I die.</t3028> <t3029>My aim is not to deprive Lucie, who is both your child, your friend, and your soulmate, of her privileges, but to support her and, if possible, to bind her to you even more.</t3029><t3030>"</t3030>
<t3031>Darnay's hand was still on Lucie's father's hand.</t3031> <t3032>For a moment, the Doctor responded to this touch in a manner that was not cold, but he immediately placed his hands on the arms of his chair and, for the first time since their conversation began, looked at Darnay's face.</t3032> <t3033>The conflict within him was reflected on his face; there was a rare expression of intense doubt and fear on his face.</t3033>
<t3034>"You speak so sincerely and bravely, Charles Darnay, that I thank you with all my heart, and now I will open my heart to you completely – or let's say a large part of it.</t3034> <t3035>Has there been anything to make you think that Lucie loves you too?</t3035><t3036>"</t3036>
<t3037>"No.</t3037> <t3038>Not at all.</t3038><t3039>"</t3039>
<t3040>"Is the real reason you are opening up to me to get my permission to understand this?"</t3040><t3041>"</t3041>
<t3042>"Not even that.</t3042> <t3043>Maybe it won't give me such hope for weeks.</t3043> <t3044>But maybe tomorrow I will see this hope (right or wrong).</t3044><t3045>"</t3045>
<t3046>"So, do you want me to show you the way?</t3046><t3047>"</t3047>
<t3048>"I had no intention of asking such a thing, sir.</t3048> <t3049>But upon reflection, if you deem it appropriate, I would like to benefit from your ideas.</t3049><t3050>"</t3050>
<t3051>"Do you want me to make a promise?"</t3051><t3052>"</t3052>
<t3053>"I would like to, sir."</t3053><t3054>"</t3054>
<t3055>"What word?"</t3055><t3056>"</t3056>
<t3057>"I have understood very well that if you are not there, there is no hope at all.</t3057> <t3058>If there is one more thing I have understood, it is that even if Miss Manette were to give me a place in her innocent heart right now – but don't think I am claiming such a thing – I wouldn't be able to hold on much against the love she has for her father.</t3058><t3059>"</t3059>
<t3060>"Well, do you also know what this means?</t3060><t3061>"</t3061>
<t3062>"I know that a word from her father approving one of the suitors would mean everything to her.</t3062> <t3063>Therefore, Doctor Manette," said Darnay humbly but resolutely, "I will not ask such a thing from you.</t3063><t3064>"</t3064>
<t3065>"I am sure of this.</t3065> <t3066>Charles Darnay, secrets arise not only from great conflicts but also from deep affections; in the latter, they are delicate and very fragile, and difficult to unravel.</t3066> <t3067>In this regard, my daughter Lucie is a mystery to me; I have no idea where her heart lies.</t3067><t3068>"</t3068>
<t3069>"Well sir, could it be that his-" When Darnay couldn't continue, Lucie's father completed the sentence.</t3069>
<t3070>"Does she have another suitor?</t3070><t3071>"</t3071>
<t3072>"Yes, this is what I wanted to ask."</t3072><t3073>"</t3073>
<t3074>Lucie's father thought for a moment before responding.</t3074>
<t3075>"You had seen Mr. Carton here before.</t3075> <t3076>Mr. Stryver also comes occasionally.</t3076> <t3077>If there is such a thing, it can only be one of them.</t3077><t3078>"</t3078>
<t3079>"Or both," said Darnay.</t3079>
<t3080>"I didn't think that both would be interested; I don't really believe it.</t3080> <t3081>You were asking for a promise from me.</t3081> <t3082>Go ahead, say it.</t3082><t3083>"</t3083>
<t3084>"If Miss Manette comes to you one day and opens her heart to you as I just dared to do, please take on my words and tell her that you believe in them.</t3084> <t3085>I hope you think well of me and do not influence her negatively.</t3085> <t3086>I will not ask anything else from you for my own benefit, that's all.</t3086> <t3087>If there is anything you demand in return for this request, I can fulfill it immediately.</t3087><t3088>"</t3088>
<t3089>"I promise," said the Doctor, "and I have no demands.</t3089> <t3090>I believe that your purpose, as you say, is pure and sincere.</t3090> <t3091>I also believe that your intention is not to weaken the bonds between me and my daughter, who is a part of my very soul, but to eternalize them.</t3091> <t3092>If the day comes when she tells me that she has found true happiness with you, I will give her to you.</t3092> <t3093>Charles Darnay- if such a thing happens...</t3093><t3094>"</t3094>
<t3095>The young man reached out to the Doctor's hand with gratitude; as the Doctor continued to speak, their hands joined.</t3095>
<t3096>"For my daughter's well-being, it is necessary to stay away from any intention, thought, or concern directed towards the man she truly loves – this man not being directly sommiu.</t3096> <t3097>My daughter is my everything; beyond the pains I've endured, beyond the mistakes I've made, far beyond.</t3097> <t3098>Anyway! It's all empty talk.</t3098><t3099>"</t3099>
<t3100>The Doctor's slow descent into silence and the way he fixed his gaze on him after finishing his words were so strange that Darnay felt the hand that the Doctor slowly loosened and released starting to grow cold.</t3100>
<t3101>"You had told me something," said Doctor Manette, suddenly smiling.</t3101> <t3102>"What was that thing you said?</t3102><t3103>"</t3103>
<t3104>Although Darnay did not know how to respond for a moment, he soon remembered the matter.</t3104> <t3105>With the relief this brought, he said:</t3105>
<t3106>"I must fully deserve the trust you have in me.</t3106> <t3107>As you may recall, my current name, though similar to my mother's maiden name, is not my real name.</t3107> <t3108>I would like to tell you what it is and why I am in England.</t3108><t3109>"</t3109>
<t3110>"Stop!" said the Doctor from Beauvais.</t3110>
<t3111>"I wanted there to be nothing I hid from you in order to be worthy of your trust.</t3111><t3112>"</t3112>
<t3113>"Stop!"</t3113>
<t3114>The doctor immediately covered his ears with both hands; he even brought his hands to Darnay's lips shortly after.</t3114>
<t3115>"When I ask you, tell me, not now.</t3115> <t3116>If things go well and Lucie loves you, you will tell me this on the morning of the wedding day.</t3116> <t3117>Promise?"</t3117>
<t3118>"Of course."</t3118><t3119>"</t3119>
<t3120>"Give me your hand.</t3120> <t3121>Lucie will come soon, and it's better if she doesn't see us together tonight.</t3121> <t3122>Now go!</t3122> <t3123>God bless you!"</t3123>
<t3124>When Charles Darnay left the Doctor's side, it was already dark, and an hour had passed by the time Lucie arrived; the young girl immediately ran into the room alone –since Miss Pross had gone straight upstairs– and was surprised to see that the chair where he always read his book was empty.</t3124>
<t3125>"Dad," she called out.</t3125> <t3126>"Daddy!"</t3126>
<t3127>There was no answer, but faint hammering sounds were coming from his father's bedroom.</t3127> <t3128>He quietly passed through the room in between and looked into the man's room, and in fear, pale as a ghost, he exclaimed, "Oh, what am I going to do now!</t3128> <t3129>What am I going to do!" he shouted, running back in a panic.</t3129>
<t3130>Her hesitation was very brief; she immediately turned back, knocked on her father's door, and called out in a soft tone.</t3130> <t3131>Upon the young girl's call, the noise ceased, and soon her father came out to join her; for a long time, they walked together, back and forth.</t3131>
<t3132>That night, Lucie got out of bed and went to check on her father.</t3132> <t3133>The man was sleeping deeply, and his set of shoemaking tools and the unfinished work were exactly where they had been left.</t3133>
<t3134>XI</t3134>
<t3135>Portrait of a Friend</t3135>
<t3136>That same night or the morning of that same night, Mr. Stryver said to his jackal, "Sydney, make another bowl of punch.</t3136> <t3137>I have something to tell you.</t3137><t3138>"</t3138>
<t3139>Sydney had worked overtime that night, the night before, and the night before that, and many consecutive nights, sitting and dealing with the documents that needed to be organized and sorted before Mr. Stryver went on a long vacation.</t3139> <t3140>Finally, the organizing work was done, Stryver's debts were cleared, and they had gotten rid of all the tasks at hand, until both the literal and legal fog enveloped the surroundings in November and the mill started turning again.</t3140>
<t3141>Sydney, despite having so much work, was never lively and sober.</t3141> <t3142>To get through the night well, he had to use an extra load of wet towels; because he had consumed just as much wine before the towel phase; now he was in a terrible state, he took off the towel wrapped around his head and threw it into the basin he had been dipping it into and wetting every now and then for the past six hours.</t3142>
<t3143>The burly Stryver, lying on the couch with his hands on his belt, looked around and called out, "Are you making the punch?"</t3143>
<t3144>"I'm preparing."</t3144><t3145>"</t3145>
<t3146>"Look now!</t3146> <t3147>I'm going to tell you something that will surprise you a lot, and you might see that I'm not as smart as you think I am.</t3147> <t3148>I want to get married.</t3148><t3149>"</t3149>
<t3150>"Is that so?</t3150><t3151>"</t3151>
<t3152>"Yes! But not for the money.</t3152> <t3153>What are you saying?</t3153><t3154>"</t3154>
<t3155>"I don't want to say much."</t3155> <t3156>"With whom?"</t3156>
<t3157>"Guess what."</t3157><t3158>"</t3158>
<t3159>"Do I know them?"</t3159><t3160>"</t3160>
<t3161>"Guess."</t3161><t3162>"</t3162>
<t3163>"At five in the morning, when my brain is so muddled and scattered, I can't predict anything.</t3163> <t3164>If you really want me to guess, we can have dinner together one evening.</t3164><t3165>"</t3165>
<t3166>"Alright then, I'll tell you," said Stryver as he slowly sat down.</t3166> <t3167>"Sydney, I find it difficult to explain myself to you, because you are an insensitive fellow.</t3167><t3168>"</t3168>
<t3169>While stirring the punch, Sydney turned to him and said, "But you," she said, "are so emotional and poetic.</t3169><t3170>"</t3170>
<t3171>Laughing heartily, "Come on!" Stryver replied, "Although I don't claim to be someone with a romantic soul (but I hope to understand these things better one day), it's certain that I'm more sensitive than you."</t3171><t3172>"</t3172>
<t3173>"You are luckier, if that's what you mean.</t3173><t3174>"</t3174>
<t3175>"I didn't mean it like that.</t3175> <t3176>What I meant to say is, I am more... more...</t3176><t3177>"</t3177>
<t3178>"I suppose you mean gentleman," said Carton.</t3178> <t3179>"Alright, let's say gentleman then.</t3179> <t3180>What I really mean is," said Stryver, continuing to puff himself up to his friend who was preparing punch, "I am a man who can make himself accepted by women, who can endure some difficulties to make himself accepted, and who knows better how to make himself accepted.</t3180><t3181>"</t3181>
<t3182>"Go on," said Sydney Carton.</t3182>
<t3183>"No; before continuing," said Stryver, shaking his head forcefully from side to side, "let me fully explain this matter to you.</t3183> <t3184>You have been at Doctor Manette's house as much as I have, if not more.</t3184> <t3185>You can't imagine how embarrassed I was by your sulkiness there!</t3185> <t3186>Every time I saw you in that sullen, silent state, I was mortified, Sydney!</t3186><t3187>"</t3187>
<t3188>"It is extremely beneficial for a man working in Baroda to feel ashamed of such things," replied Sydney, "so you should be grateful to me.</t3188><t3189>"</t3189>
<t3190>Stryver responded to his sharp reply, "You won't get away with it like this," he retorted sharply, "no Sydney, it is my duty to tell you this – I'm telling you to your face for your own good – you behave very disgracefully and nonsensically in public.</t3190> <t3191>You are a grumpy man.</t3191><t3192>"</t3192>
<t3193>Sydney drank a full glass of the punch she had prepared and laughed heartily.</t3193>
<t3194>"Look at me for a moment!" said Stryver, gesturing with his hand, "compared to you, I don't need to prove myself at all, I am sufficient on my own in any situation.</t3194> <t3195>But why am I doing this?</t3195><t3196>"</t3196>
<t3197>"We have never seen you do anything either," Carton grumbled.</t3197>
<t3198>"I am doing this politically; I am doing it out of principle.</t3198> <t3199>Look at me! How far I've come.</t3199><t3200>"</t3200>
<t3201>With an indifferent attitude, "You haven't made much progress with marriage yet," said Carton; "but don't give up, keep going.</t3201> <t3202>As for me, haven't you realized yet that I'm an incorrigible man?</t3202><t3203>"</t3203>
<t3204>He had asked this question with a slight hint of disdain.</t3204>
<t3205>"You can't even be a man who can't be reformed," said his friend in a tone that was far from reassuring.</t3205>
<t3206>"Nothing will ever come of me anyway," said Sydney Carton.</t3206> <t3207>"Who is this lady?</t3207><t3208>"</t3208>
<t3209>"But if I tell you her name now, you might get upset, Sydney," said Stryver, as if he were preparing him with a showy sincerity for what he was about to explain, "because I know you don't mean half of what you say, but even if you did, it wouldn't matter.</t3209> <t3210>I made such an introduction because you had previously spoken honorably about this young lady.</t3210><t3211>"</t3211>
<t3212>"Is that so?</t3212><t3213>"</t3213>
<t3214>"Yes; and right here.</t3214><t3215>"</t3215>
<t3216>Sydney Carton first looked at the punch in his glass, then at his contented friend; then he drank his punch and looked again at his contented friend.</t3216>
<t3217>"You had mentioned this young lady as the golden-haired doll.</t3217> <t3218>This young lady is Miss Manette.</t3218> <t3219>If you were a man with a bit of sensitivity and kindness, Sydney, I might have been offended by the way you spoke of her, but you are not.</t3219> <t3220>You have never had a share of such things; therefore, what you say doesn't bother me more than a person without an eye for beauty commenting on a painting I made or a person without an ear for music commenting on a composition I created.</t3220><t3221>"</t3221>
<t3222>Sydney Carton took a big gulp of his drink; then, looking at his friend, he downed the glass that was filled to the brim.</t3222>
<t3223>"Now you know everything, Syd," said Mr. Stryver.</t3223> <t3224>"I have no interest in money or wealth.</t3224> <t3225>She is a magnificent creature and I have decided to be happy; I think I can succeed in being happy.</t3225> <t3226>Even in my current state, I am quite wealthy, rapidly rising, and a man with many advantages.</t3226> <t3227>This is a great opportunity for her, but I mean, she also deserves this opportunity, of course.</t3227> <t3228>Are you surprised?</t3228><t3229>"</t3229>
<t3230>Carton, who was still busy drinking punch, said gruffly, "Why should I be surprised?"</t3230>
<t3231>"So you approve.</t3231><t3232>"</t3232>
<t3233>Carton, who was still drinking punch, answered gruffly, "Why shouldn't I approve?"</t3233>
<t3234>"Alright!" said Stryver, "You got over it more easily than I expected and you didn't approach it as opportunistically as I thought, but of course, you know very well how determined your old friend is to get what he wants.</t3234> <t3235>Yes Sydney, I'm tired of this same old way of life; I think it's a very nice thing for a man to have a home he can go to when he wants (and escape from when he doesn't), and it seems to me that Miss Manette would be a good wife in any case and would bring me respect.</t3235> <t3236>That's how I made my decision.</t3236> <t3237>Now Sydney, big boy, I have some things to say about your "situation."</t3237> <t3238>You know you're on a bad path, my friend; really on a bad path.</t3238> <t3239>You don't know the value of money, you're pushing yourself too hard, one day you won't be able to get up, you'll fall ill and be penniless; you should consider having a woman to take care of you.</t3239><t3240>"</t3240>
<t3241>Speaking like a well-off boss made him appear twice as big and four times as unpleasant as he actually was.</t3241>
<t3242>Stryver continued his speech, "Now my advice to you is to open your eyes and look around.</t3242> <t3243>I opened my eyes and found my way; you should open your eyes and find your way too.</t3243> <t3244>Get married.</t3244> <t3245>Find someone to take care of you.</t3245> <t3246>It doesn't matter if you get bored among women, don't understand them, or lack refinement.</t3246> <t3247>You just find someone.</t3247> <t3248>Even if she doesn't have much money – maybe she has a house or a boarding house – let her be a respectable lady and marry her, save yourself.</t3248> <t3249>This is what you need.</t3249> <t3250>Think about this carefully, Sydney.</t3250><t3251>"</t3251>
<t3252>"I will think about it," said Sydney.</t3252>
<t3253>XII</t3253>
<t3254>The Polite Man</t3254>
<t3255>Mr. Stryver, who had decided to give a grand gift to the doctor's fortunate daughter, was determined to convey this happy news to her before leaving town for his long vacation.</t3255> <t3256>After pondering the matter for a while, he concluded that it would be good to make an attempt, and then they would have time to plan the wedding either a week or two before the Feast of St. Michael on September 29th, or sometime between Christmas and the Feast of St. Hilary of Poitiers on January 13th.</t3256>
<t3257>As for the strength of his case, he had not the slightest doubt, but he could see the path to judgment.</t3257> <t3258>This was a clear case argued with the jury on worldly grounds – the only grounds that could be taken seriously – and it had not the slightest weakness.</t3258> <t3259>He called himself as the plaintiff, and it was impossible to deal with the evidence.</t3259> <t3260>The defendant's lawyer threw the case summary, but the jury did not even turn to look.</t3260> <t3261>Lawyer Stryver, C.</t3261> <t3262>J.</t3262> <t3263>was convinced that there could not be a simpler case than this.</t3263>
<t3264>Therefore, Mr. Stryver began his long vacation with a formal proposal, inviting Miss Manette to Vauxhall Gardens; when that did not work, he suggested going to Ranelagh Gardens; when that also did not work, he decided it would be appropriate to go to Soho and reveal his noble intention.</t3264>
<t3265>Thus, Mr. Stryver, with the freshness of the long holiday he had taken, left Temple and headed towards Soho.</t3265> <t3266>Those who saw him when he was still on the Saint Dunstan side of Temple Bar, upon seeing him in Soho, could understand how confident and strong he was from his swaggering walk, pushing and shoving poor people aside.</t3266>
<t3267>As Mr. Stryver, who was passing by Tellson's Bank, thought of stopping by to talk to Mr. Lorry about the shining sun in Soho, since he was both a customer of Tellson's and a close friend of the Manettes, he decided to visit the bank.</t3267> <t3268>Thus, with a slight rasp in his throat, he pushed the door open, stumbled down the two steps, passed by the two aged tellers, and threw himself into the musty compartment at the back where Mr. Lorry was seated over the large, lined ledgers kept for accounts; the vertical iron bars on the window stood like the lines separating the figures, and everything else under the sky seemed like their sum total.</t3268>
<t3269>"Hello!" said Mr. Stryver.</t3269> <t3270>"How are you?</t3270> <t3271>Hope all is well.</t3271><t3272>"</t3272>
<t3273>In every environment he entered, everywhere, Mr. Stryver's most prominent feature was his large stature.</t3273> <t3274>He was too bulky for Tellson as well, so much so that the elderly clerks sitting in distant corners raised their heads and looked at him with reproachful eyes as if they were being squeezed against the wall. The Manager, reading his newspaper over there, lifted his head with a stern expression as if Stryver's head was encroaching on his area of responsibility.</t3274>
<t3275>The prudent Mr. Lorry, in a tone that demonstrated how one should speak in such an environment, said, "How are you, Mr. Stryver?</t3275> <t3276>How are you, sir?" and shook his hand.</t3276> <t3277>In the handshake, there was the manner of every clerk at Tellson's.</t3277> <t3278>When the manager was around, there was a certain demeanor while shaking a customer's hand.</t3278> <t3279>It was as if it wasn't him shaking the hand, but the Tellson and Company itself.</t3279>
<t3280>"How can I assist you, Mr. Stryver?" asked Mr. Lorry, in his businessman's voice</t3280>
<t3281>"No, thank you; this is a personal visit, Mr. Lorry; I have come to talk to you about something private.</t3281><t3282>"</t3282>
<t3283>"Is that so?" said Mr. Lorry, listening intently but his eyes had shifted to the Manager ahead.</t3283>
<t3284>"I am going," said Mr. Stryver, confidently leaning his arms on the table; despite it being a large table, he occupied half of it.</t3284> <t3285>"I am going to propose marriage to your sweet little friend Miss Manette, Mr. Lorry.</t3285><t3286>"</t3286>
<t3287>"Good heavens!" shouted Mr. Lorry, rubbing his chin and looking at his visitor with suspicious eyes.</t3287>
<t3288>"Why, good heavens, sir?" said Stryver, drawing back.</t3288> <t3289>"Good heavens, why, sir?</t3289> <t3290>What did you mean, Mr. Lorry?</t3290><t3291>"</t3291>
<t3292>"What I mean," the businessman began, "of course it involves friendship and appreciation and is extremely beneficial for you, in short, I mean there's nothing bad about it.</t3292> <t3293>But – actually, you know, Mr. Stryver –" Mr. Lorry, as if something had stopped him from continuing, nodded his head in the strangest manner, "you are a bit too, I mean actually, excessively grand.</t3293><t3294>"</t3294>
<t3295>Stryver, striking Mr. Lorry's desk with his rough hand, said "Well then!" and took a deep breath, opening his eyes wide, "it's impossible to understand you either!</t3295><t3296>"</t3296>
<t3297>Mr. Lorry adjusted his small wig from both sides of his ears to the back and bit his quill pen.</t3297>
<t3298>Stryver, fixing his eyes on Mr. Lorry, said, "Damn it! Am I not suitable for her then?</t3298><t3299>"</t3299>
<t3300>"Ah of course!</t3300> <t3301>Of course you are suitable!" said Mr. Lorry.</t3301> <t3302>"If you see yourself as suitable, then you are suitable.</t3302><t3303>"</t3303>
<t3304>"Am I not a successful and wealthy man?" asked Stryver.</t3304>
<t3305>"Ah! If it's about success and wealth, of course you are," said Mr. Lorry,</t3305>
<t3306>"Aren't I steadily rising in my job?</t3306><t3307>"</t3307>
<t3308>"You are certainly rising," said Mr. Lorry, pleased to be able to confirm it once more, "let no one doubt it.</t3308><t3309>"</t3309>
<t3310>"So what do you mean by that, Mr. Lorry?" asked Stryver, with visible distress.</t3310>
<t3311>"Um! Were you- going there now?" asked Mr. Lorry.</t3311>
<t3312>"Yes!" said Stryver, banging his fist on the table with a thud.</t3312>
<t3313>"In that case, if I were you, I wouldn't go.</t3313><t3314>"</t3314>
<t3315>"Why?" asked Stryver.</t3315> <t3316>Pointing his finger at him as if he were in court, he said, "I will corner you now."</t3316> <t3317>"You are a businessman and there must be a reason for what you say.</t3317> <t3318>Explain your reason.</t3318> <t3319>Why wouldn't you go there?</t3319><t3320>"</t3320>
<t3321>"Because," said Mr. Lorry, "if I had such an intention, I would not go without a reason to believe that I would succeed."</t3321><t3322>"</t3322>
<t3323>"Damn it!" shouted Stryver, "you really did it.</t3323><t3324>"</t3324>
<t3325>Mr. Lorry first glanced at the distant Manager and then at the angry Stryver.</t3325>
<t3326>"A businessman –at this age– a man with this experience –a man working in a bank," said Stryver; "you are given three fundamental reasons for absolute success and you say you have no reason!</t3326> <t3327>And you say this with your head held high!" Mr. Lorry had a strange belief, it seems, that if he said these things with his head bowed, they would somehow be less valid, according to Mr. Stryver.</t3327>
<t3328>"When I say success, I am talking about the success of reaching the young girl's heart; as for the reasons and justifications that will make this success possible, these are things that only this young lady would know.</t3328> <t3329>Only this young lady, dear sir," said Mr. Lorry, lightly tapping Stryver's arm, "This is something the young lady knows.</t3329> <t3330>The young lady's thoughts are more important than anything else.</t3330><t3331>"</t3331>
<t3332>"Mr. Lorry, what you mean to tell me," said Stryver, placing his elbows, "is the young lady a delicate fool in this matter?"</t3332><t3333>"</t3333>
<t3334>"Of course not."</t3334> <t3335>"What I want to tell you, Mr. Stryver," said Mr. Lorry, with a flushed face, "is that I will not allow anyone to speak disrespectfully about this young lady; if someone were to – and I hope no one does – lose control of their vulgarity and audacity and attempt to speak disrespectfully about her at this table, not even Tellson could prevent me from putting them in their place."</t3335><t3336>"</t3336>
<t3337>When it was his turn to get angry, the necessity of suppressing his anger had put Mr. Stryver's veins at risk; although Mr. Lorry's veins generally pulsed regularly, they were not in very good condition because it was his turn to get angry.</t3337>
<t3338>"These were the things I wanted to say, sir," said Mr. Lorry.</t3338> <t3339>"Please, let there be no mistake.</t3339><t3340>"</t3340>
<t3341>After Mr. Stryver chewed on the end of a ruler for a while, he made noises by tapping his teeth, but this must have hurt his teeth as he stopped.</t3341> <t3342>Breaking the strange silence, he said:</t3342>
<t3343>"I never expected this Mr. Lorry. Are you now advising me – Stryver of the King's Bench – not to go to Soho and not to make an offer?</t3343><t3344>"</t3344>
<t3345>"Do you want my advice, Mr. Stryver?</t3345><t3346>"</t3346>
<t3347>"Yes, I do.</t3347><t3348>"</t3348>
<t3349>"Very good.</t3349> <t3350>Then let me tell you, and you should follow these exactly.</t3350><t3351>"</t3351>
<t3352>"All I will say," said Stryver, laughing in an offended manner, "is that your words –ha ha!– erase the entire past, present, and future."</t3352><t3353>"</t3353>
<t3354>"Don't misunderstand me," continued Mr. Lorry.</t3354> <t3355>"As a businessman, I cannot be certain of the accuracy of what I say on this matter, after all, I am a businessman and I do not understand much about these subjects.</t3355> <t3356>However, I told you these things as an old man who has carried Miss Manette in his arms, been a reliable friend to her and her father, and loves both of them very much.</t3356> <t3357>Remember that I was not the one who brought up this matter.</t3357> <t3358>Am I wrong now?</t3358><t3359>"</t3359>
<t3360>"You are right!" said Stryver, vaguely.</t3360> <t3361>"When it comes to common sense, I value my own opinions more than those of third parties.</t3361> <t3362>I had thought some people were reasonable, but you say this delicate fool is a complete idiot.</t3362> <t3363>This was something I did not expect, but I suppose you are right.</t3363><t3364>"</t3364>
<t3365>"Mr. Stryver, what I think is a part of my personality.</t3365> <t3366>Please understand me, sir," said Mr. Lorry, suddenly turning bright red again, "I cannot accept anyone –even within Tellson's– interpreting my thoughts in this manner.</t3366><t3367>"</t3367>
<t3368>"So be it!</t3368> <t3369>I apologize!" said Stryver.</t3369>
<t3370>"Accepted.</t3370> <t3371>Thank you.</t3371> <t3372>So, Mr. Stryver, what I meant to say was this: Seeing that you were mistaken might upset you, having to tell you some things plainly might upset Doctor Manette, and speaking frankly might also be very distressing for Miss Manette.</t3372> <t3373>You know under what circumstances I had the honor and happiness of being with them.</t3373> <t3374>If you wish, without involving your name at all, I can try to observe a bit more and come to a judgment in order to review my advice.</t3374> <t3375>If you are not satisfied with the result, you can question its validity yourself, but if you are satisfied and reach the point where we are now, everyone will go their own way.</t3375> <t3376>What do you say?</t3376><t3377>"</t3377>
<t3378>"How long do I need to stay in the city?</t3378><t3379>"</t3379>
<t3380>"Ah! Just a few hours of work.</t3380> <t3381>In the evening, I'll go to Soho, and then I'll come to you.</t3381><t3382>"</t3382>
<t3383>"Alright then," said Stryver.</t3383> <t3384>"I won't go now, it's not that urgent; I accept and I am expecting you this evening.</t3384> <t3385>Good day.</t3385><t3386>"</t3386>
<t3387>Then, as Mr. Stryver turned around and left the bank, he created such a dramatic atmosphere that the two elderly clerks standing behind the counters, who were greeting him, made every effort not to topple over.</t3387>
<t3388>These very esteemed frail individuals were always seen in a state of greeting, even to the extent that, according to common belief, when they bid farewell to someone, they would remain in that state until they welcomed a new customer, even if the office was empty.</t3388>
<t3389>The lawyer was smart enough to know that the banker, besides his sharp instincts, could not express his thoughts to this extent without solid grounds.</t3389> <t3390>He was caught off guard by the big pill he had to swallow and he swallowed it.</t3390> <t3391>"Now," said Mr. Stryver at Temple Bar, waving his finger around as if he were in court, "the only way to settle this is to prove that you are wrong.</t3391><t3392>"</t3392>
<t3393>Kurnaz Old Bailey tactics were now easing his troubles.</t3393> <t3394>"You will show me that I am not mistaken, young lady," said Mr. Stryver; "I will make you do it.</t3394><t3395>"</t3395>
<t3396>Therefore, when Mr. Lorry knocked on his door at the late hour of around ten at night, Mr. Stryver, amidst the books and papers he had deliberately scattered around, seemed as if the morning's matter had completely slipped his mind.</t3396> <t3397>Upon seeing Mr. Lorry, he showed a sign of surprise, appearing distracted and busy.</t3397>
<t3398>"Well!" said the kind-hearted envoy, after waiting in vain for an hour for him to bring up the subject.</t3398> <t3399>"I went to Soho today.</t3399><t3400>"</t3400>
<t3401>"Did you go to Soho?" Mr. Stryver repeated coldly.</t3401> <t3402>"Oh, of course!</t3402> <t3403>What am I saying!</t3403><t3404>"</t3404>
<t3405>"Regarding the truth of what we have discussed," said Mr. Lorry, "I have no doubt left.</t3405> <t3406>My opinion has been confirmed, and I reiterate my advice to you.</t3406><t3407>"</t3407>
<t3408>"Believe me," replied Mr. Stryver, in his most friendly manner, "I felt sorry for you, and for your poor father as well.</t3408> <t3409>I know that this matter will always be a sad situation for this family; it's best to close this subject.</t3409><t3410>"</t3410>
<t3411>"I don't understand you," said Mr. Lorry.</t3411>
<t3412>"Never mind," replied Stryver, in a soothing and decisive manner; "it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter.</t3412><t3413>"</t3413>
<t3414>"Don't say that, it's an important matter," insisted Mr. Lorry.</t3414>
<t3415>"No, it's not important; believe me, it's not.</t3415> <t3416>I was mistaken in thinking that where there is no logic, there is logic, and where there is no enthusiasm, there is praiseworthy enthusiasm, but it's okay, it's not a problem. Other young ladies I knew before had done such foolish things, and then they regretted it in misery and poverty.</t3416> <t3417>If I think without being selfish, I am saddened that it didn't happen, because it would have been bad for me financially; if I look at it selfishly, again it would have been bad for me financially – I would have gained nothing from this.</t3417> <t3418>So, I have no loss.</t3418> <t3419>I made no offer to the young lady, and between us, thinking about it, I'm not even sure it was a good decision to bring it to that point.</t3419> <t3420>Mr. Lorry, you cannot control the delicate pride and frivolity of empty-headed girls; one should not have such an expectation, otherwise, you will always be disappointed.</t3420> <t3421>Now please, let's not talk about this any further.</t3421> <t3422>As I said, I felt sorry for them but I am pleased for myself.</t3422> <t3423>I am grateful to you for listening to me and advising me; after all, you know the young lady better than I do; you were right, this wouldn't have worked.</t3423><t3424>"</t3424>
<t3425>Mr. Lorry was so surprised that he stared blankly at Mr. Stryver, who had escorted him to the door with a shower of insincere thoughts disguised as great generosity, tolerance, and goodwill.</t3425>
<t3426>"Let it be for the best for us, sir," said Stryver; "let's not talk about this anymore; thank you again for listening to me; good night!</t3426><t3427>"</t3427>
<t3428>Mr. Lorry found himself in the darkness of the night before he could understand what was happening.</t3428> <t3429>Mr. Stryver, on the other hand, was lying on his couch, winking at the ceiling.</t3429>
<t3430>Thirteen</t3430>
<t3431>Rude Man</t3431>
<t3432>Although Sydney Carton shone in other environments, he definitely did not shine in Doctor Manette's house.</t3432> <t3433>For a year, he had frequently visited their home but always sat idly by with his grumpy demeanor and sullen face.</t3433> <t3434>When he deigned to speak, he spoke well, but the light within him could rarely pierce through the deadly darkness of his indifferent attitude.</t3434>
<t3435>He even loved the meaningless stones that formed the streets and sidewalks surrounding his house.</t3435> <t3436>On most nights when the wine couldn't give him temporary happiness, he would wander those streets, head clouded, miserably; as dawn broke with all its gloom, his lonely silhouette would appear, and when the first rays of the sun illuminated the beauties of the distant church towers and majestic buildings, he would still be wandering there, as if these silent hours evoked in his mind the feeling that good things, otherwise unthought of and unattainable, would happen.</t3436> <t3437>Recently, he had been visiting his bed in Temple less frequently; most of the time when he did throw himself into bed, it didn't last long, and he would get up and go back to that neighborhood.</t3437>
<t3438>On a day in August, when Mr. Stryver (after informing his jackal that he now thought differently about marriage) carried his gentle presence to Devonshire, and the appearance and scent of the flowers in the city's streets began to bring goodness to the wicked, healing to the sick, and youth to the old, Sydney was still busy pacing the roads.</t3438> <t3439>His indecision and clueless state had ended, and with the purposes that gave him vitality and the thought of implementing them, he found himself at the Doctor's door.</t3439>
<t3440>When they sent him upstairs, he found Lucie working alone.</t3440> <t3441>The young girl had never been very comfortable around him, so when Sydney sat down next to the table, she greeted him a bit shyly.</t3441> <t3442>However, after the usual pleasantries, the young girl noticed some changes in him.</t3442>
<t3443>"I didn't see you very well, Mr. Carton!"</t3443>
<t3444>"I am not well.</t3444> <t3445>For the life I lead does not suit my health, Miss Manette.</t3445> <t3446>What can be expected from a libertine like me?</t3446><t3447>"</t3447>
<t3448>"I'm sorry, but –I can't help but ask– isn't it a sad situation that you can't live a better life?</t3448><t3449>"</t3449>
<t3450>"Truly a painful situation."</t3450><t3451>"</t3451>
<t3452>"Then why don't you change this?</t3452><t3453>"</t3453>
<t3454>The young girl looked meekly at Sydney and was surprised and saddened when she saw the tears streaming from her eyes.</t3454> <t3455>As she replied, Sydney's voice was also filled with tears:</t3455>
<t3456>"It's too late now.</t3456> <t3457>I can never have a better life.</t3457> <t3458>I will only sink lower and get worse.</t3458><t3459>"</t3459>
<t3460>He had his elbows resting on the girl's table, covering his eyes with his hand.</t3460> <t3461>In the ensuing silence, the table was trembling.</t3461>
<t3462>The young girl had never seen him so weak and sorrowful before.</t3462> <t3463>Without looking at the girl, Sydney knew how she might be feeling and said:</t3463>
<t3464>"Please forgive me, Miss Manette.</t3464> <t3465>I broke down before I could say more to you.</t3465> <t3466>Do you want to listen to me?</t3466><t3467>"</t3467>
<t3468>"If it will be of any benefit to you, Mr. Carton, if it will make you happy, then I will be pleased as well."</t3468><t3469>"</t3469>
<t3470>"How compassionate you are.</t3470> <t3471>May God protect you!</t3471><t3472>"</t3472>
<t3473>He calmly started to speak after removing his hand from his face.</t3473>
<t3474>"What I have to say should not worry you.</t3474> <t3475>Do not be afraid.</t3475> <t3476>I am like someone who died young.</t3476> <t3477>It has been this way all my life.</t3477><t3478>"</t3478>
<t3479>"No, Mr. Carton.</t3479> <t3480>I am sure there are much better days ahead for you; I am sure you will reach much better places.</t3480><t3481>"</t3481>
<t3482>"Thank you Miss Manette, even though I know that what I said is true –even though my poor heart is a mystery, I know this– I will never forget what you said!</t3482><t3483>"</t3483>
<t3484>The young girl's color had faded, and she was trembling.</t3484> <t3485>The man was so helpless that he didn't know what to say in front of her.</t3485>
<t3486>"Miss Manette, even if it were possible for you to reciprocate the love of this man before you – the self-ruined, wasted, drunken, and worthless wretch – despite all your happiness, you would be aware every moment, every minute, that he brings you suffering, pain, and regret, that he disappoints you, ruins your life, and drags you down with him.</t3486> <t3487>I know very well that you cannot harbor any love for me in your heart; I do not ask for such a thing; in fact, I am grateful that such a thing cannot be.</t3487><t3488>"</t3488>
<t3489>After hesitating for a moment, Miss Manette said, "Even if there isn't such a thing, can't I help you, Mr. Carton?</t3489> <t3490>Can't I –forgive me but– lead you to a better life?</t3490> <t3491>Isn't there a way to restore your confidence in yourself?</t3491> <t3492>I know this is all about believing," she added humbly and with sincere tears, "I know you won't tell anyone about this.</t3492> <t3493>Can't I turn this situation to your advantage, Mr. Carton?</t3493><t3494>"</t3494>
<t3495>Sydney shook her head from side to side.</t3495>
<t3496>"No, Miss Manette.</t3496> <t3497>There is no way.</t3497> <t3498>If you listen to me a little more, you will have done the best you can.</t3498> <t3499>I want you to know that you were the last dream I saw.</t3499> <t3500>Seeing your father and this home with you in it, revives the dreams I thought were dead and pulls me further down.</t3500> <t3501>Since I met you, I have been feeling a guilt I thought had left me, and I hear those old whispers that I thought had silenced forever, trying to pull me up.</t3501> <t3502>There are vague thoughts in my mind calling me to start everything anew, to turn over a new leaf, to shake off the laziness and sensitivity, and to return to the struggle I had abandoned.</t3502> <t3503>This is a dream with no end, leaving the dreamer where they lie, all of these are dreams, but I want you to know that you are the one who inspires these dreams.</t3503><t3504>"</t3504>
<t3505>"Does it really lead nowhere?</t3505> <t3506>Oh Mr. Carton, please think a little more!</t3506> <t3507>Give it a try!</t3507><t3508>"</t3508>
<t3509>"No, Miss Manette; I know that I am a man who deserves nothing.</t3509> <t3510>Perhaps it was a weakness to tell you how you brought me back to life, how you suddenly turned me, who was no different from a heap of ashes, into a burning fire, truly a weakness, but such a fire that, although it has penetrated me, it moves nothing, illuminates nothing, serves no purpose, it just burns inwardly.</t3510><t3511>"</t3511>
<t3512>"Mr. Carton, it is such a misfortune for me that you have become even more unhappy after getting to know me..."</t3512><t3513>"</t3513>
<t3514>"Don't say that, Miss Manette, if there is anything in this world that can do me good, it is you.</t3514> <t3515>You cannot be the cause of my worsening.</t3515><t3516>"</t3516>
<t3517>"If I had such an influence on the state of mind you described – I mean, what I want to say is – can't I use this influence for your benefit?</t3517> <t3518>Do I have no power at all to positively affect your life?</t3518><t3519>"</t3519>
<t3520>"The best thing that could happen to me, Miss Manette, is to be here right now.</t3520> <t3521>Let me live with the memory of the day I opened my heart to you for the rest of my misguided life, and let the thing you pity and grieve over now live with me forever.</t3521><t3522>"</t3522>
<t3523>"The thing I have pleaded for with all my heart and soul, Mr. Carton, could have led to very beautiful things in your life!</t3523><t3524>"</t3524>
<t3525>"Please tell me to stop believing in this, Miss Manette! It's clear what I am, I know myself well.</t3525> <t3526>I will upset you; I am rapidly progressing down a bad path.</t3526> <t3527>If we return to what I was saying, could I ask you to keep this last secret of my life hidden in your pure and innocent heart and not to reveal it to anyone?</t3527><t3528>"</t3528>
<t3529>"If this will be a consolation for you, yes.</t3529><t3530>"</t3530>
<t3531>"Even to the person who is most valuable to you, right?" After an uneasy silence, the young girl replied, "Mr. Carton, this secret is yours, not mine; I promise to keep it."</t3531><t3532>"</t3532>
<t3533>"Thank you.</t3533> <t3534>God bless you.</t3534><t3535>"</t3535>
<t3536>Carton brought the young girl's hand to his lips and walked towards the door.</t3536>
<t3537>"Do not worry Miss Manette, I will not bring up this matter again.</t3537> <t3538>This issue is closed here.</t3538> <t3539>Consider me dead.</t3539> <t3540>Know that, on my deathbed, I will remember this sacred moment –and I will always be grateful to you for it– for I will have made my final confession to you and you will carry my name, my mistakes, and my pains in your heart.</t3540> <t3541>Aside from this, I hope your heart will always be at ease and happy!</t3541><t3542>"</t3542>
<t3543>Carton was so different from the way he had been before, and it was so painful to see how much he had consumed his life, despised himself, and hindered himself, that as he stood speaking with his back turned, Lucie Manette began to cry sorrowfully.</t3543>
<t3544>"Calm down!" said Carton, "your tears are not worth it, Miss Manette.</t3544> <t3545>Even in a couple of hours, no matter how angry I get, because of my wretched friends and habits that I cannot resist, I will become worse than the desperate people wandering these streets, and I will not be worth your tears at all.</t3545> <t3546>Calm down!</t3546> <t3547>Inside, my feelings towards you will always remain the same, but from the outside, I will appear just as you have always seen me.</t3547> <t3548>My last request from you is to believe me on this matter.</t3548><t3549>"</t3549>
<t3550>"I believe, Mr. Carton."</t3550><t3551>"</t3551>
<t3552>"I actually have one last request, and after that, I will rid you of this visitor with whom you have no common ground and between whom there is an insurmountable chasm.</t3552> <t3553>I know it's unnecessary to say this, but I can't help myself.</t3553> <t3554>There is nothing I wouldn't do for you and your loved ones, Miss Manette.</t3554> <t3555>If I had a better job and consequently an opportunity or situation to make a sacrifice for you or your loved ones, I would do it without hesitation.</t3555> <t3556>When you are alone, remember me with this vitality and sincerity.</t3556> <t3557>The day will come, and that day is very near, when you will form new bonds in your life, bonds that will bring you closer to your beloved home more sincerely and strongly, and these pleasant bonds will honor and make you happy forever.</t3557> <t3558>Ah Miss Manette, as a happy father looks sweetly at you and the little ones carrying your bright beauty grow at your feet, know both now and then that there is a man ready to give his life to ensure your happiness remains unspoiled!</t3558><t3559>"</t3559>
<t3560>"Goodbye!" he said finally, "God bless you!" and left the young girl's side.</t3560>
<t3561>14</t3561>
<t3562>Honest Tradesman</t3562>
<t3563>Every day, a variety of people passed in front of Mr. Jeremiah Cruncher, who sat on his stool with his mischievous son on Fleet Street.</t3563> <t3564>Who wouldn't be bewildered by the sight of two immense caravans, one heading west with the sun and the other east, towards the plains beyond the reds and purples formed where the sun sets, while sitting on Fleet Street during these busy hours of the day?</t3564>
<t3565>Mr. Cruncher, with a straw in his mouth, was watching these two currents like a boatman observing the flow of the river that has surrounded hell for centuries, but Jerry never believed that these currents would ever dry up.</t3565> <t3566>He hoped they wouldn't either, as a small portion of his income came from ferrying delicate ladies (mostly well-dressed, middle-aged ones) across to the other side on behalf of Tellson.</t3566> <t3567>In these brief acquaintances, Mr. Cruncher would always show great interest in the ladies and felt a tremendous desire to reach the honor of toasting to their health.</t3567> <t3568>Thus, he earned a part of his income, as he did now, from the money given as a reward for this benevolence.</t3568>
<t3569>In the past, a poet used to sit on a stool in places where there were a lot of people and get lost in thoughts while watching the passersby.</t3569> <t3570>Mr. Cruncher, who was sitting on a stool in the crowd, however, was not a poet and wasn't thinking much; he was just looking around.</t3570>
<t3571>However, it was now a season when the crowd and elderly women were not abundant, and business was generally going so poorly that a strong suspicion arose within Mr. Cruncher that Mrs. Cruncher had sighed, just at that moment an unusual crowd flowing from the west towards Fleet Street caught his attention.</t3571> <t3572>After looking for a while, Mr. Cruncher decided that it was a funeral crowd; a large number of people protesting the funeral had caused a great commotion.</t3572>
<t3573>"Look Jerry," said Mr. Cruncher, turning to his son, "the funeral is coming.</t3573><t3574>"</t3574>
<t3575>"Way to go, Dad!" shouted little Jerry.</t3575>
<t3576>There was a mysterious situation in the cheerful shout that came from the little gentleman.</t3576> <t3577>The older gentleman, however, did not like this shout very much; when he found the opportunity, he gave the little gentleman a slap on the ear.</t3577>
<t3578>"What's going on?</t3578> <t3579>Why are you shouting?</t3579> <t3580>Are you trying to say something to your father, you scoundrel?</t3580> <t3581>This child is getting too much now!" said Mr. Cruncher, eyeing him.</t3581> <t3582>"As if he himself wasn't enough, he's also shouting 'long live'!</t3582> <t3583>Don't make a sound again or I'll come down on you.</t3583> <t3584>Did you hear me?</t3584><t3585>"</t3585>
<t3586>"I didn't say anything bad," Little Jerry protested, rubbing his cheek.</t3586>
<t3587>"Cut it short," said Mr. Cruncher; "Keep your words to yourself.</t3587> <t3588>Get up on that stool and look at that rudeness.</t3588><t3589>"</t3589>
<t3590>The child listened to his father's words, the crowd had approached; they were shouting and booing around a pale-colored hearse and again a pale-colored mourning carriage; inside the mourning carriage, there was a single mourner dressed in pale-colored clothes due to the gravity of his position.</t3590> <t3591>He was not at all pleased with his situation, because the noisy crowd surrounding the carriage was mocking him, making faces, and continuously groaning, "Boo! Spies! Boo! Spies!" along with many other unrepeatable, unspeakable insults.</t3591>
<t3592>Funerals had always piqued Mr. Cruncher's interest; whenever a funeral passed by Tellson's, he would watch it with full attention and get excited.</t3592> <t3593>Therefore, naturally, this unusual group accompanying the funeral had quite excited him, and he immediately asked the man running in front:</t3593>
<t3594>"Brother, what is this?</t3594> <t3595>What's happening?</t3595><t3596>"</t3596>
<t3597>"I don't know either," said the man.</t3597> <t3598>"Spies! Boo! Spies!"</t3598>
<t3599>He asked another man.</t3599> <t3600>"Who is this?"</t3600>
<t3601>"I don't know!" said the man, but he had brought his hand to his mouth and was shouting with incredible enthusiasm and tremendous zeal: "Spies! Boo! Boo! Spies!</t3601><t3602>"</t3602>
<t3603>Finally, a man who knew more about this matter came across him, and from this man, he learned that the funeral was for someone named Roger Cly.</t3603>
<t3604>"What is the case?" asked Mr. Cruncher.</t3604>
<t3605>"Old Bailey spy!" said the source of the news.</t3605> <t3606>"Boo! Boo! Old Bailey spies!</t3606><t3607>"</t3607>
<t3608>Remembering the trial he himself had attended, Jerry shouted, "Ah, of course!"</t3608> <t3609>"I had seen him."</t3609> <t3610>"He's dead, isn't he?"</t3610>
<t3611>"A corpse, a corpse," the other replied, "saying he died is an understatement.</t3611> <t3612>Get them out!</t3612> <t3613>Spies! Get them out!</t3613> <t3614>Spies!"</t3614>
<t3615>In an environment where there were no other ideas, this idea was so reasonable that the crowd eagerly jumped on it, and while they kept reiterating their suggestions to get them out of the car, shouting loudly, the two vehicles got so close to each other that they had to stop.</t3615> <t3616>As someone from the crowd opened the car door, the only mourning passenger quickly threw himself out and found himself amidst the crowd, but he was so alert and agile that he threw off his cloak, hat, hatband, white handkerchief, and other symbols of mourning, and fled straight into the side streets.</t3616>
<t3617>While those around were tearing all these items into pieces with great pleasure and scattering them around, the shopkeepers hastily pulled down their shutters; in such times, such a mob knew no bounds and could turn into a terrifying monster.</t3617> <t3618>The crowd had gone so far as to open the car door and take out the coffin, but a bright-minded person suggested that instead of removing it from the car, they should accompany it cheerfully to its destination.</t3618> <t3619>Due to the need for practical suggestions, this proposal was also met with applause, and suddenly eight men filled the inside of the car, a dozen clung to the outside, and meanwhile, a large number swarmed onto the roof of the car with great skill.</t3619> <t3620>Among those leading the way was Jerry Cruncher, who had curled up in a corner inside the mourning car and was humbly hiding his spiky hair to avoid being seen by those from Tellson's.</t3620>
<t3621>The funeral attendants initially protested a bit about this change in the ceremony, but the river was quite close, and when some of them started making remarks that dipping the stubborn attendants into the cold water would bring them to their senses, the objections ceased.</t3621> <t3622>The transformed procession set off with the chimney sweep as the driver – the actual driver sat next to him, carefully watching and guiding him; the mourning coach was driven by a minister and a pie seller.</t3622> <t3623>Before the cavalry regiment even reached the Strand, a bear handler, a street character much loved at the time, joined them, adding color to the procession; as for his very dirty black bear, it gave the procession a truly funereal atmosphere as it walked along.</t3623>
<t3624>Thus, the boisterous procession advanced, drinking beers, puffing on pipes, singing songs, accompanied by an endless imitation of sorrow, and constantly adding new members to their ranks; everyone who saw them closed their shops.</t3624> <t3625>The place they were headed to was the old St Pancras Church, far away in the middle of the fields.</t3625> <t3626>After a while, they reached their destination and all flowed into the cemetery like a flood; finally, they managed to bury the late Roger Cly in their own way and to their own satisfaction.</t3626>
<t3627>The dead had been buried, and the crowd was in a rush to find a new amusement when another genius (perhaps the same man) came up with the witty idea of accusing passersby of being Old Bailey spies and taking revenge on them.</t3627> <t3628>To bring this idea to life, they grabbed hold of a bunch of innocent people who had never even passed near Old Bailey in their entire lives and harassed them by pushing and shoving.</t3628> <t3629>Naturally, from there, they moved on to the game of breaking windows and looting houses.</t3629> <t3630>Eventually, a few hours later, after some summer houses had been demolished and fences torn down, rumors spread that soldiers were coming to support the warrior spirits.</t3630> <t3631>Even before the rumor spread, the crowd had gradually dispersed; the soldiers may or may not have come, but this was what happened in all stampedes.</t3631>
<t3632>Mr. Cruncher had not attended the closing celebration; he had stayed behind in the cemetery in the churchyard, talking to the funeral staff.</t3632> <t3633>This place had a calming effect on him.</t3633> <t3634>He had found a pipe in one of the nearby pubs, and was smoking it while looking at the fences and thinking about the commotion that had taken place.</t3634>
<t3635>Mr. Cruncher said to himself, as usual, "Jerry! That day you saw Cly with your own eyes, and you saw that he was young and strong."</t3635><t3636>"</t3636>
<t3637>After smoking his pipe and drifting into thoughts for a while, it occurred to him that he needed to take his place at Tellson's before closing time.</t3637> <t3638>Whether the thoughts about mortality he had been pondering had affected his liver, his health had been deteriorating for some time, or he simply wanted to show interest in an important personage, it was unknown, but on his way back, he paid a brief visit to the family doctor – a distinguished surgeon.</t3638>
<t3639>Little Jerry had taken responsibility and reassured his father, saying that nothing had happened in his absence.</t3639> <t3640>The bank closed, the old clerks left, the clock was set as usual, and Mr. Cruncher and his son went home to have tea.</t3640>
<t3641>When he came inside, "Look, let me tell you something now!" said Mr. Cruncher to his wife.</t3641> <t3642>"As an honest tradesman, if my business goes wrong again tonight, I will be sure that you have cursed me and I will punish you as if I had seen it with my own eyes.</t3642><t3643>"</t3643>
<t3644>Mr. Cruncher nodded his head forward sadly.</t3644>
<t3645>"Why are you looking at my face like that?" shouted Mr. Cruncher, furious with rage.</t3645>
<t3646>"I didn't say anything."</t3646><t3647>"</t3647>
<t3648>"Don't say good; don't even think about it.</t3648> <t3649>Whether you kneel down and pray or just think about it, it all leads to the same outcome.</t3649> <t3650>Don't do anything.</t3650><t3651>"</t3651>
<t3652>"Okay Jerry.</t3652><t3653>"</t3653>
<t3654>"Alright Jerry," repeated Mr. Cruncher as he sat down for tea.</t3654> <t3655>"Oh! Again 'Alright Jerry'.</t3655> <t3656>Don't you know anything else?</t3656> <t3657>Alright Jerry, alright Jerry.</t3657><t3658>"</t3658>
<t3659>The words Mr. Cruncher kept repeating grumpily did not convey a specific meaning but rather expressed a sarcastic dissatisfaction, much like many people often do.</t3659>
<t3660>"You and your 'All right, Jerry,'" said Mr. Cruncher, taking a bite of his buttered bread as if he were swallowing it with the help of an invisible oyster taken from a saucer.</t3660> <t3661>"Ah! I think so too.</t3661> <t3662>I believe you.</t3662><t3663>"</t3663>
<t3664>As Mr. Cruncher took a second bite of his bread, his polite wife asked, "Are you going out tonight?"</t3664>
<t3665>"Yes, I will go out.</t3665><t3666>"</t3666>
<t3667>His son immediately blurted out, "Can I come with you too, Dad?"</t3667>
<t3668>"No, you cannot come.</t3668> <t3669>As your mother knows, I am going fishing.</t3669> <t3670>Yes, that's right.</t3670> <t3671>I am going fishing.</t3671><t3672>"</t3672>
<t3673>"But didn't your fishing rod rust, dad?"</t3673><t3674>"</t3674>
<t3675>"It's none of your business.</t3675><t3676>"</t3676>
<t3677>"Will you bring fish, Dad?</t3677><t3678>"</t3678>
<t3679>"If I don't bring it, there will be nothing to eat tomorrow," said the man, shaking his head; "come on, that's enough questions; I'll go after you fall asleep.</t3679><t3680>"</t3680>
<t3681>Jerry did not take his eyes off Mrs. Cruncher for the rest of the evening and kept talking to her harshly so that she wouldn't start cursing him.</t3681> <t3682>With this thought, he also forced his son to keep his mother engaged in conversation and subjected the poor woman to countless complaints to prevent her from being alone and lost in her thoughts.</t3682> <t3683>Even the most devout person would not regard the effect of a sincere prayer as much as he did; he was so suspicious of his own blood.</t3683> <t3684>It was like someone who claimed not to believe in ghosts being scared by a ghost story.</t3684>
<t3685>"Look at me!" said Mr. Cruncher.</t3685> <t3686>"I don't want any trouble tomorrow!</t3686> <t3687>If I manage to bring home a few pieces of meat as an honest tradesman, there's no skipping that and just eating bread.</t3687> <t3688>If I can also bring home some beer as an honest tradesman, there's no saying you'll just drink water.</t3688> <t3689>When in Rome, do as the Romans do.</t3689> <t3690>If you don't do this, Rome will treat you like a bad customer.</t3690> <t3691>I'm your Rome, don't you forget it.</t3691><t3692>"</t3692>
<t3693>Then he started muttering again:</t3693>
<t3694>"You are depriving your own bread and water!</t3694> <t3695>Because of your kneeling and praying and those merciless behaviors, no food or drink has entered the house.</t3695> <t3696>Look at your son.</t3696> <t3697>Look!</t3697> <t3698>This child is yours, isn't he?</t3698> <t3699>He has become skin and bones.</t3699> <t3700>Do you now call yourself a mother?</t3700> <t3701>Don't you know that a mother's first duty is to feed her child?</t3701><t3702>"</t3702>
<t3703>These words had touched Little Jerry; he called for his mother to fulfill her first duty, as the matter of fulfilling the maternal duty, which his father had expressed in an impressive and gentle manner, had created a much greater impact on the child than anything else the woman had done or neglected.</t3703>
<t3704>Little Jerry was sent to bed, and his mother was sent to sleep with a similar pacifier, thus ending the evening for the Cruncher family.</t3704> <t3705>Mr. Cruncher spent the early hours of the night smoking his pipe alone and waited for the clock to strike one to go for his walk.</t3705> <t3706>As the first and eerie hour of the day approached, he got up from his chair, took a key out of his pocket, opened a locked cabinet, and took out a sack, a crowbar of appropriate size, a rope, a chain, and other fishing equipment.</t3706> <t3707>After carefully placing these items in the sack, he gave Mrs. Cruncher one last scornful look, turned off the light, and went outside.</t3707>
<t3708>Little Jerry, who just pretended to undress when he went to his room, went outside right after his father.</t3708> <t3709>He quietly left the room in the darkness that enveloped everything, went down the stairs, into the courtyard, and from there to the street.</t3709> <t3710>He had no worry about how to return home because there were plenty of tenants in the building and the door would stay ajar all night.</t3710>
<t3711>With admirable determination, Little Jerry, trying to learn the intricacies and mysteries of his father's honorable work, followed him with his eyes on his honorable father, passing through door frames, wall edges, and door cracks.</t3711> <t3712>The honorable father, heading north, had not gone far when another disciple of Izaak Walton joined him, and they continued their arduous walk together.</t3712>
<t3713>Half an hour after setting out, they passed the flickering street lamps and the even more flickering watchmen, and reached a deserted road.</t3713> <t3714>Here, another fisherman joined them – the man had joined them so quietly that if Little Jerry had been a superstitious person, he might have thought that the second follower of the delicate task had suddenly split into two.</t3714>
<t3715>The trio continued on their way and Jerry followed these three men until they stopped under an earthen embankment on the road.</t3715> <t3716>There was a low brick wall with iron railings on top of the embankment.</t3716> <t3717>The trio, in the shadow of the embankment and the wall, turned into a narrow dead-end road; the wall still extended along one side of the road – two and a half to three meters high.</t3717> <t3718>The next thing Jerry, crouched in a corner and watching this narrow road, saw was the figure of his honest father, very clearly visible in front of the pale and cloud-covered moon, hurriedly testing the weight of an iron gate.</t3718> <t3719>Soon after, his father jumped over it, followed by the second fisherman, and then the third fisherman jumped over.</t3719> <t3720>They all made a soft landing over the gate and lay on the ground for a while – probably listening to their surroundings.</t3720> <t3721>Then they proceeded on their hands and knees.</t3721>
<t3722>Now it was Little Jerry's turn to jump from the door.</t3722> <t3723>He jumped, holding his breath.</t3723> <t3724>When he crouched in a corner again and looked at them, he saw the three fishermen crawling among the thick grass and all those tombstones in the churchyard – it was a big yard – the tombstones looked like ghosts in white, and the church tower looked like the ghost of a terrible giant.</t3724> <t3725>Soon they stopped crawling, stood up, and began to fish.</t3725>
<t3726>They started fishing with a garden spade.</t3726> <t3727>Then the honorable father continued with a tool that resembled a large corkscrew.</t3727> <t3728>No matter what tool they used, they were working hard, but the church clock struck so terribly that it scared Little Jerry so much that, with his hair standing up like his father's, he didn't know how to run away.</t3728>
<t3729>But the desire to learn what was happening inside him, which he had been carrying for a while, soon stopped him and even made him turn back.</t3729> <t3730>When he hid by the door for the second time and watched them, they were still fishing with determination, but this time it seemed like something had been caught on the line.</t3730> <t3731>Sounds of struggling and whining came from below, and the bodies of the men, bent forward, tensed as if something was pulling them down.</t3731> <t3732>Slowly, the weight slipped out of the soil and surfaced.</t3732> <t3733>Little Jerry had understood what was going to come out, but when he saw it, moreover, when he saw that his honorable father was about to pull and open it, he was so terrified by this sight he was not used to that he started running without looking back, and only after running a mile or two did he stop.</t3733>
<t3734>Even if he didn't need to catch his breath, he wouldn't stop; it was as if he was racing against ghosts, and his only desire was for this race to end.</t3734> <t3735>He had a strong belief that the coffin he had just seen was chasing him; it seemed to be hopping and bouncing after him, upright on its narrow side, and at any moment it could catch up to him and hop right beside him – maybe it would grab him by the arm – the chase never ended.</t3735> <t3736>It was like a demon whose actions were unclear and whose emergence was unpredictable, and as it had made the night he left behind utterly terrifying, Little Jerry burst out from the dark side streets onto the main road and fled from it in terror, like a skinny child's tailless and wingless kite, leaping away in fright.</t3736> <t3737>The demon also hid in door cracks, rubbing its terrifying shoulders against the doors and pulling them up to its ears as if it were laughing.</t3737> <t3738>It blended into the other shadows on the road.</t3738> <t3739>It cunningly lay on its back on the ground to trip Little Jerry.</t3739> <t3740>All this time, it never stopped hopping behind the child and didn't leave him alone; when he finally reached the door of their house, Little Jerry was exhausted.</t3740> <t3741>But even then, the demon hadn't left him alone; it had followed him up the stairs with thudding steps, entered the bed with him, and when the child fell asleep, it settled heavily on his chest.</t3741>
<t3742>Little Jerry in his small room was awakened from this troubled sleep at dawn, before the sun had risen, by the sounds coming from his father and mother's bedroom.</t3742> <t3743>Seeing his father holding Ms. Cruncher by the ears and banging the back of her head against the bedpost, it seemed things had gone wrong for his father; at least, that's what Little Jerry thought.</t3743>
<t3744>"I told you, I would do it," said Mr. Cruncher, "and I did."</t3744><t3745>"</t3745>
<t3746>"Jerry, Jerry, Jerry!" his wife pleaded.</t3746>
<t3747>"We didn't gain anything because of you," said Jerry, "you are also causing trouble in our partnership.</t3747> <t3748>You should have just stayed put, why didn't you listen to me?</t3748><t3749>"</t3749>
<t3750>The poor woman, in tears, protested, "I'm trying to be a good wife, Jerry."</t3750>
<t3751>"Are you being a good wife by ruining your husband's work?</t3751> <t3752>Will you honor him by sabotaging his work?</t3752> <t3753>Are you obeying your husband by not following what he says about his important work?</t3753><t3754>"</t3754>
<t3755>"Back then, you weren't doing this terrible job, Jerry."</t3755><t3756>"</t3756>
<t3757>"It's enough that you're the wife of an honest tradesman," retorted Mr. Cruncher, "so don't stick your nose into these matters with that woman's mind of yours.</t3757> <t3758>A woman who respects her husband and obeys him does not interfere in his affairs.</t3758> <t3759>Do you now call yourself pious?</t3759> <t3760>If you are a pious woman, go find me an impious one!</t3760> <t3761>Your sense of duty is not even as much as that stake in the Thames River; that stake should be driven into you instead.</t3761><t3762>"</t3762>
<t3763>This argument had taken place in a low voice and ended after the honest shopkeeper kicked off his muddy boots and lay down full length on the ground.</t3763> <t3764>After casting a timid glance at his father, who was lying on his back with his rusty hands under his head as a pillow, his son also lay down beside him and fell back asleep.</t3764>
<t3765>There was no fish for breakfast, and there were very few other foods as well.</t3765> <t3766>Mr. Cruncher was both grumpy and angry, and he had an iron pot lid with him to throw at Mrs. Cruncher if he noticed any sign of her saying a prayer of thanks.</t3766> <t3767>After washing his face and combing his hair at the usual time, he set off with his son towards his ostensible duty.</t3767>
<t3768>On the sunny and crowded Fleet Street, Little Jerry, walking beside his father with his stool under his arm, was very different from the Little Jerry who had fled from his cruel pursuer in the darkness and desolation of the previous night.</t3768> <t3769>His spirits had been refreshed by the dawn of the new day, and his worries had ended with the night – after all, it was not unexpected to have his peers on Fleet Street and in the city of London on such a beautiful morning.</t3769>
<t3770>"Dad," said Little Jerry as they walked –he was trying to keep an arm's length distance and to hold the stool between himself and his father– "who is the one that brings a man out of the grave?</t3770><t3771>"</t3771>
<t3772>Mr. Cruncher paused on the sidewalk for a moment before answering, "How should I know?</t3772><t3773>"</t3773>
<t3774>"I used to think you knew everything, dad," said the child innocently.</t3774>
<t3775>"Hmm! Well," replied Mr. Cruncher, continuing to walk and taking off his hat to free his spiky hair, "he is a tradesman.</t3775><t3776>"</t3776>
<t3777>"Well, what does he sell, dad?" asked the curious Little Jerry.</t3777>
<t3778>"The things he sells," said Mr. Cruncher, after weighing what he was going to say in his mind, "are used in some scientific studies.</t3778><t3779>"</t3779>
<t3780>"Human bodies, you mean, dad?" the child asked excitedly this time.</t3780>
<t3781>"I suppose something like that," said Mr. Cruncher.</t3781>
<t3782>"Oh dad, when I grow up, I want to be a grave robber too then!</t3782><t3783>"</t3783>
<t3784>Mr. Cruncher was relieved but shook his head from side to side in an undecided and virtuous manner.</t3784> <t3785>"It depends on how you develop your skills.</t3785> <t3786>Strive to improve your skills and don't promise people more than you can deliver; we can't know yet what will be suitable for you."</t3786> <t3787>Encouraged by these words, when Jerry stepped a few paces ahead of his father to place the stool in the shadow of Temple Bar, Mr. Cruncher said to himself, "Honest tradesman Jerry, you'll see, this child will be a great blessing for you and will make up for his mother's shortcomings!</t3787><t3788>"</t3788>
<t3789>XV</t3789>
<t3790>Knitting</t3790>
<t3791>Drinking had started earlier than usual at Monsieur Defarge's wine shop.</t3791> <t3792>At six in the morning, pale faces peering through the barred windows saw other faces bent over wine glasses inside.</t3792> <t3793>Even in the best of times, Monsieur Defarge always sold wine diluted with water, but lately, the wine he sold was even more diluted.</t3793> <t3794>It was a sour wine, moreover, it soured its surroundings, because it affected the mood of those who drank it, making them melancholic.</t3794> <t3795>The sparks of Bacchic joy that sprang from Monsieur Defarge's pressed grapes were not bright flames, but a fire smoldering in the dark, hidden in the pulp of the grapes.</t3795>
<t3796>For three consecutive days, early drinking had started at Monsieur Defarge's place.</t3796> <t3797>This situation had begun on Monday, and today was Wednesday.</t3797> <t3798>In fact, people were more deep in thought than drinking; many didn't have a penny to pay the bill, yet as soon as the shop opened, they would slip inside, listen to the conversations, and whisper among themselves.</t3798> <t3799>All they cared about was finding out what was happening, but they would wander from table to table, corner to corner, with an attitude as if they could buy all the wine barrels in the shop, greedily sipping the conversations instead of the wine.</t3799>
<t3800>Despite this unusual crowd, the owner of the wine shop was nowhere to be seen.</t3800> <t3801>Not that his absence was felt; no one entering through the door was looking for him or asking about him, and no one was pondering why only –sitting with a bowl containing money as tattered, worn, and frayed as the pockets they came from, managing the distribution of the wine–</t3801> <t3802>Madame Defarge was there.</t3802>
<t3803>From the king's palace to the prisoners' dungeon, spies scattered everywhere probably observed a general distraction with suspended curiosity when they looked at this wine shop.</t3803> <t3804>The card players had become sluggish, the domino players were building towers out of the pieces in deep thought, the wine drinkers were drawing shapes on their tables with spilled wine drops, and Madam Defarge, while fiddling with the patterns on her knitting with a toothpick, occasionally gazed into the distance as if she had seen or heard something.</t3804>
<t3805>St. Antoine's drunken state continued until noon.</t3805> <t3806>When two men passed through these streets and under their swinging lamps, covered in dust and dirt, the sun was directly overhead.</t3806> <t3807>One was Monsieur Defarge, the other was a road worker with a blue cap.</t3807> <t3808>Covered in dust from head to toe and parched with thirst, they rushed into the wine shop.</t3808> <t3809>Their arrival had set St. Antoine's heart ablaze, spreading as they walked, igniting and trembling the faces of people at the doors and windows.</t3809> <t3810>Yet no one followed them, and when they entered the wine shop, no one said a word to them, but all eyes were on them.</t3810>
<t3811>"Hello gentlemen!" said Monsieur Defarge.</t3811>
<t3812>It was as if this was a signal given to loosen the tongues of the people.</t3812> <t3813>In response, they all opened up and said in unison, "Hello!"</t3813>
<t3814>"The weather is very bad, gentlemen!" said Defarge, shaking his head from side to side.</t3814>
<t3815>Upon this, everyone looked at the person next to them, then lowered their eyes and sat quietly.</t3815> <t3816>But one of them had stood up and gone outside.</t3816>
<t3817>Defarge called out loudly, "Madam," to Madam Defarge: "Look, I have traveled to many places with this kind-hearted road worker named Jacques.</t3817> <t3818>I met him –by chance– in a place one and a half days away from Paris.</t3818> <t3819>His name is Jacques, this road worker is a good boy.</t3819> <t3820>Give him a drink, madam!</t3820><t3821>"</t3821>
<t3822>A man got up and went outside.</t3822> <t3823>Madame Defarge took off her blue hat, greeted the crowd, and placed the wine in front of Jacques, the road worker, who drank it.</t3823> <t3824>The man had taken out a black bread with grains from his coat; he occasionally took a bite from it, eating and drinking noisily next to Madame Defarge's counter.</t3824> <t3825>At that moment, a third man got up and left the shop.</t3825>
<t3826>Defarge took a sip of his wine—his wine was less than the man he brought with him, but after all, he always had it at hand—and refreshed himself, waiting for the peasant to finish his breakfast.</t3826> <t3827>The man was not looking at anyone there, and no one was looking at him now; not even Madam Defarge, who lifted her knitting and tended to the shop.</t3827>
<t3828>"Have you finished your meal, my friend?" asked Defarge, when the time came.</t3828>
<t3829>"Yes, thank you."</t3829><t3830>"</t3830>
<t3831>"Then come on!</t3831> <t3832>Let me show you the apartment I said you could stay in.</t3832> <t3833>It's just the right place for you.</t3833><t3834>"</t3834>
<t3835>From the wine shop to the street, from the street to a courtyard, from the courtyard to a steep staircase, and from the staircase to an attic – an attic where an old man with thin white hair was busy making shoes at a low workbench, his back hunched – they went.</t3835>
<t3836>There was no longer the white-haired man, but the three men who came out of the wine shop one by one were still there.</t3836> <t3837>However, there was a small connection between themselves and the white-haired man in the distance, which was that they had once watched him through the cracks in the wall.</t3837>
<t3838>Defarge carefully closed the door and began to speak in a low voice.</t3838>
<t3839>"Jacques One, Jacques Two, Jacques Three! Here is the witness found by me, Jacques Four.</t3839> <t3840>He will tell you everything now.</t3840> <t3841>Speak up, Jacques Five!</t3841><t3842>"</t3842>
<t3843>The road worker, wiping his sunburned forehead with the blue hat in his hand,.</t3843><t3844>said, "Where should I start, monsieur?"</t3844>
<t3845>Mr. Defarge's response was not at all unreasonable, "From the beginning.</t3845><t3846>"</t3846>
<t3847>"When I saw him last summer, gentlemen," the road worker began, "he was hanging from a chain under the Marquis's carriage.</t3847> <t3848>Picture it in your mind.</t3848> <t3849>My work on the road was finished, I was leaving, the sun was returning to its bed, and as the Marquis's carriage was slowly climbing the hill, he was hanging from a chain – just like this.</t3849><t3850>"</t3850>
<t3851>The road worker reenacted the incident; since his performance had become the village's sole absolute source and inevitable entertainment throughout the entire year, he had now perfected it.</t3851>
<t3852>Jacques Bir; intervened and asked him if he had seen this man before.</t3852>
<t3853>"I've never seen it," replied the road worker, as he returned to an upright position.</t3853>
<t3854>Jacques Three then asked how he could recognize him later.</t3854>
<t3855>"From his tall height," said the road worker in a soft tone, placing his finger on his nose.</t3855> <t3856>"When Monsieur Marquis asked me that evening, 'What does this man look like?' I said, 'He is tall like a ghost.'</t3856><t3857>"</t3857>
<t3858>"I think you should have said as short as a dwarf," said Jacques Two.</t3858>
<t3859>"But how could I have known?</t3859> <t3860>The action was not yet complete, and he didn't trust me anyway.</t3860> <t3861>Just think! Even in that situation, I didn't say much.</t3861> <t3862>Monsieur Marquis stood by our little fountain, pointed at me with his finger, and said, 'Bring me that scoundrel!'</t3862> <t3863>Honestly, gentlemen, I didn't go and say anything.</t3863><t3864>"</t3864>
<t3865>"You're right, Jacques," murmured Defarge to the person who interrupted.</t3865> <t3866>"Alright, go on!</t3866><t3867>"</t3867>
<t3868>"Good!" said the road worker with a mysterious air.</t3868> <t3869>"Then the tall man disappears, they look for him – how many months pass?</t3869> <t3870>Nine, ten, maybe eleven?</t3870><t3871>"</t3871>
<t3872>"Forget the number;" said Defarge.</t3872> <t3873>"It's well hidden but unfortunately, it gets found in the end.</t3873> <t3874>Continue!"</t3874>
<t3875>"One day, I am working on the hill again and the sun is about to set.</t3875> <t3876>I am gathering my tools to return to my house in the village below, it has already darkened down there, then I lift my head and see six soldiers coming down the hill.</t3876> <t3877>Right in the middle of them is a tall man with his arms tied – they tied them from the side like this!</t3877><t3878>"</t3878>
<t3879>He portrayed a man whose elbows were tightly bound to his hips, accompanied by the hat he never let go of, with knots tied at the back.</t3879>
<t3880>"Then, gentlemen, I move to the side, over by the piles of stones, so I can see the soldiers and the prisoner passing by (after all, it's a deserted road, there's nothing worth looking at) as they approach, I see nothing but six soldiers and a tall man with his arms tied, and they are all pitch black –but those on the side where the sun is setting seem to be outlined with a red line, gentlemen. Also, I see their long shadows cast on the ditch on the other side of the road and the hill above it, you would think that the shadows of giants had fallen."</t3880> <t3881>"And they are all covered in dust, and as they march with a steady rhythm, the dust moves along with them!"</t3881> <t3882>"But when they get close enough, I recognize the tall man, and he recognizes me. Ah, just like the evening we first met, in the same places, how wonderful it would be if he threw himself down the hill again!"</t3882><t3883>"</t3883>
<t3884>He was describing it as if he had gone there again, and it was clear that he was reliving the events; perhaps he hadn't seen much in his life until now.</t3884>
<t3885>"I never let the soldiers know that I recognize the tall man; he doesn't let on that he recognizes me either, but we understand each other through our eyes, we see this.</t3885> <t3886>The soldier in charge points to the village and says, 'Come on! Take him to his grave immediately!' and the men speed up.</t3886> <t3887>I'm following them too.</t3887> <t3888>They've tied him up so tightly that his arms are swollen, his wooden shoes are huge and clumsy, and as if that weren't enough, he's also limping.</t3888> <t3889>Of course, he walks slowly because he's limping, and the soldiers are pushing him with their rifles – exactly like that!</t3889><t3890>"</t3890>
<t3891>He portrayed a man being pushed with a rifle butt.</t3891> <t3892>"As they race down the hill like madmen competing with each other, the man falls to the ground.</t3892> <t3893>The soldiers laugh and pick him up from the ground.</t3893> <t3894>The man's face is bleeding and covered in dirt, but he can't touch his face; so they laugh again.</t3894> <t3895>They bring him to the village; the whole village runs to see him; they walk him past the mill and onto the road leading to the prison; all the villagers witness the prison door opening and swallowing the man in the darkness of the night – just like that!</t3895><t3896>"</t3896>
<t3897>He opened his mouth as wide as he could and made a harsh sound by clashing his teeth together.</t3897> <t3898>Realizing that he did not want to open his mouth again to avoid ruining the effect he had created, Defarge said, "Go on, Jacques."</t3898>
<t3899>Standing on his tiptoes and speaking in a low voice, "The whole village," the road worker continued, "is retreating and whispering by the fountain; then they all go to sleep; the whole village sees the same unhappy person in their dreams, imprisoned behind the locked doors and iron bars on the rocks, the prisoner who will only leave here as a corpse."</t3899> <t3900>In the morning, with my tools on my shoulder, eating a piece of dark bread, I go to work, circling around the prison on my way.</t3900> <t3901>There, high up, I see him behind the bars of a majestic iron cage, his face covered in blood and dust just like the previous night, looking out.</t3901> <t3902>Since his hands are tied, he can't wave; and I don't dare call out to him; at that moment, he is no different from a dead man.</t3902><t3903>"</t3903>
<t3904>Defarge and the three men exchanged subtle glances.</t3904> <t3905>While listening to the peasant's story, their expressions were filled with gloom, anger, and hatred; there was both a mysterious and stern air about them all.</t3905> <t3906>The room was dominated by a heavy courtroom atmosphere; Jacques One and Jacques Two were sitting on an old bench, hands on their chins, listening intently to the road worker; Jacques Three, who was just as attentive, was kneeling right behind them, nervously and constantly rubbing around his mouth and nose; standing in the light reflected from the window between these three men and the storyteller, Defarge kept looking back and forth between the men and the road worker.</t3906>
<t3907>"Continue, Jacques," said Defarge.</t3907>
<t3908>"They kept the prisoner in the iron cage for a while.</t3908> <t3909>The villagers are secretly watching him because they are afraid of him.</t3909> <t3910>But from a distance, they constantly watch this prison on top of the cliffs, and when all the work is done and they gather at the fountain to gossip, they all turn their faces towards the prison.</t3910> <t3911>Previously, they always turned their faces towards the post office, but now they all face the prison.</t3911> <t3912>At the fountain, they whisper that although the man was sentenced to death, he will not be executed; they say a petition was sent to Paris for his pardon, explaining that the man went mad and lost control of himself after his child's death; another petition was personally submitted to the King.</t3912> <t3913>Who knows?</t3913> <t3914>It's possible.</t3914> <t3915>Maybe it's true, maybe it's not.</t3915><t3916>"</t3916>
<t3917>Number one, "Listen then Jacques," he objected harshly.</t3917> <t3918>"Know this.</t3918> <t3919>A petition was presented to the King and Queen.</t3919> <t3920>Everyone here except you saw the King receive this petition, he was in his carriage on the street, sitting next to the Queen.</t3920> <t3921>The one you see before you now, with the petition in hand, risking his life by throwing himself in front of the horses, was Defarge.</t3921><t3922>"</t3922>
<t3923>"Listen to this too, Jacques!" said Jacques Three, who was kneeling: His fingers were incessantly, insatiably wandering over his face, as if craving something – but it was neither food nor drink; "the petitioner was surrounded by guards, horses, and infantry, and they started beating him up.</t3923> <t3924>Do you understand?</t3924><t3925>"</t3925>
<t3926>"I understand, gentlemen.</t3926><t3927>"</t3927>
<t3928>"Then go on," said Defarge.</t3928>
<t3929>"On the other hand, according to the whispers at the fountain," continued the villager, "he was brought here to be executed on the spot and will definitely be executed.</t3929> <t3930>They are even whispering that he will be executed as a patricide because he murdered the Monsignor, and since the Monsignor was the father of the peasants – the slaves – well, what can you do.</t3930> <t3931>According to an old man at the fountain, the convict's right hand, the one that held the knife, will be burned before his eyes; hot oil, molten lead, hot resin, wax, and sulfur will be poured into the wounds opened on his arm, chest, and legs; and finally, his arms and legs will be pulled in four different directions by four strong horses.</t3931> <t3932>Then the same old man says that all of this was exactly applied to a convict who attempted to kill the late King, Louis XV.</t3932> <t3933>But I am just repeating what he said.</t3933> <t3934>I don't know.</t3934><t3935>"</t3935>
<t3936>"Then listen once more, Jacques!" said the greedy man with his hands fidgeting.</t3936> <t3937>"The name of that prisoner was Damiens, all of this happened in the streets of Paris, in broad daylight, and nothing was more interesting in that huge crowd than the eagerness of those elegant and fancy ladies to witness the prisoner's final moments – the final moments, Jacques, the final moments lasted until evening, even when both his legs and one arm were torn off, the man was still breathing!</t3937> <t3938>They did it all exactly – how old are you?</t3938><t3939>"</t3939>
<t3940>"Thirty-five," said the road worker who looked sixty years old.</t3940>
<t3941>"So this happened when you were around ten years old; you might have seen it."</t3941><t3942>"</t3942>
<t3943>"Enough!" said Defarge, with a grumpy impatience.</t3943> <t3944>"May God not punish you!</t3944> <t3945>Go on, continue.</t3945><t3946>"</t3946>
<t3947>"Alright! Some say one thing; some say another, but everyone is talking about this; it's as if even the fountain is flowing in the same tone.</t3947> <t3948>After a while, on Sunday night when the whole village is asleep, the soldiers come; they descend the prison road, and their weapons clink on the stones of the narrow street. Workers are digging; workers are hammering nails; soldiers are singing and laughing; in the morning, next to the fountain, a ten-meter-high gallows, which pours its poison into the water, rises.</t3948><t3949>"</t3949>
<t3950>When the road worker turned his eyes to the low ceiling, he saw much more beyond it and pointed to the sky as if he had seen a gallows.</t3950>
<t3951>"All work stops, everyone gathers at the fountain, no one takes the cows to graze, they are there with the villagers.</t3951> <t3952>At exactly noon, the drums thunder.</t3952> <t3953>The soldiers went to the dungeon at night and brought the prisoner, now he stands in the midst of a bunch of soldiers.</t3953> <t3954>They tied the man as before, and there is a gag in his mouth – they tied his mouth so tightly that he looks like he is smiling.</t3954><t3955>"</t3955>
<t3956>He tried to demonstrate this by pulling his face with his thumbs from the corners of his mouth to his ears.</t3956> <t3957>"They placed the knife on top of the gallows, with the sharp side facing up, the tip pointing to the sky.</t3957> <t3958>They hanged him at a height of ten meters – by poisoning the water, he remained hanging there.</t3958><t3959>"</t3959>
<t3960>The road worker had started sweating again at the sight before his eyes and used his blue hat to wipe his face while the others looked at each other.</t3960>
<t3961>"Very terrible, gentlemen.</t3961> <t3962>How will women and children get water from there now!</t3962> <t3963>Who will gossip under that shadow in the evening!</t3963> <t3964>Under it, didn't I say?</t3964> <t3965>On Monday evening, as the sun was about to set, when I left the village, when I turned around while climbing the hill, that shadow was still swaying in front of the church, the mill, and the prison – gentlemen, it seemed to cover everywhere under this sky, the entire earth!</t3965><t3966>"</t3966>
<t3967>The hungry man had started to gnaw on one of his fingers while looking at the other three, and his finger trembled under the effect of his hunger.</t3967>
<t3968>"So it is, gentlemen.</t3968> <t3969>I left there at sunset (as I was asked) and walked through that night and until noon the next day, until I met this friend (as I was told).</t3969> <t3970>Then, for the rest of the day and all through the night, we came here together, partly walking and partly on horseback.</t3970> <t3971>And now, here I am before you!</t3971><t3972>"</t3972>
<t3973>After a boring silence, Jacques Bir said, "Great! You described and explained everything with all your sincerity.</t3973> <t3974>Would you wait for us outside the door for a bit now?" he said.</t3974>
<t3975>"With pleasure," said the road worker.</t3975> <t3976>After accompanying him to the top of the ladder and seating him, Defarge turned back.</t3976>
<t3977>When Defarge returned to the attic, all three of them had stood up and were talking with their heads together.</t3977>
<t3978>"What do you say, Jacques?" asked number one.</t3978> <t3979>"Should it be recorded?</t3979><t3980>"</t3980>
<t3981>"Let it be recorded as doomed to destruction," replied Defarge.</t3981>
<t3982>"Magnificent!" shouted the greedy man in a hoarse voice.</t3982>
<t3983>"The castle and his entire family?" asked number one.</t3983>
<t3984>"The château and all its family," replied Defarge.</t3984> <t3985>"Let them all be exterminated!"</t3985>
<t3986>The hungry man shouted enthusiastically again, "Magnificent!" and started gnawing on another finger.</t3986>
<t3987>"Are you sure that our record-keeping habit won't get us into trouble?" Jacques asked Defarge Twice, "there is no danger for now because no one else can decipher this code, but will we always be able to decipher it – or rather, will your wife be able to decipher it?"</t3987><t3988>"</t3988>
<t3989>"Jacques," said Defarge, straightening up, "if my wife has committed this record to memory, she will not forget a single word – not even a syllable.</t3989> <t3990>It is all woven with stitches and symbols according to her own method, it is as clear as day to her.</t3990> <t3991>Trust Madame Defarge.</t3991> <t3992>Feeble cowards can easily be erased from this world, but not a single name or crime can be erased from the records woven by Madame Defarge."</t3992> <t3993>The men murmured among themselves in a manner that showed their trust and approval, and the greedy man said: "Will this peasant be sent back immediately?</t3993> <t3994>I hope so.</t3994> <t3995>He is a very simple man; isn't this a bit of a dangerous situation?</t3995><t3996>"</t3996>
<t3997>"He knows nothing," said Defarge; "at least he is unaware of the things that would get him hanged from the same height of a gallows.</t3997> <t3998>I take responsibility; let him stay with me; I will take care of him, then he can go his own way.</t3998> <t3999>He wants to see the world of the nobles –the King, the Queen, the Palace; let him see them all on Sunday.</t3999><t4000>"</t4000>
<t4001>"What?" shouted the hungry man, staring intently.</t4001> <t4002>"Is it a good thing that he wants to see the royal family and the nobles?</t4002><t4003>"</t4003>
<t4004>"Jacques," said Defarge; "if you want a cat to be eager to drink milk, show it the milk from a reasonable distance.</t4004> <t4005>If you show a dog its prey from a reasonable distance, one day it might catch it and bring it to you.</t4005><t4006>"</t4006>
<t4007>Nothing else was discussed, and they advised the road worker, whom they found dozing at the top of the stairs, to lie down on the couch and rest a bit.</t4007> <t4008>There was no need for insistence; the man soon fell asleep.</t4008>
<t4009>For a provincial slave in his position, there were far worse places in Paris than Defarge's tavern.</t4009> <t4010>Aside from the mysterious fear he often felt in the presence of Madame Defarge, his new life was quite pleasant.</t4010> <t4011>But Madame seemed so unaware of his existence as she sat behind that counter all day, and so clearly showed that his presence meant nothing, that every time their eyes met, the peasant trembled in his wooden shoes.</t4011> <t4012>Moreover, he thought it was impossible to guess what was going through the woman's mind, and if she ever considered that he had committed a murder and then robbed the victim, she would certainly not leave him alone until the show was complete.</t4012>
<t4013>Therefore, when Sunday came and he learned that Madam Defarge would be accompanying the road worker Monsieur to Versailles, he was not at all pleased with the situation (though, of course, he told them otherwise).</t4013> <t4014>It was extremely annoying that Madam knitted throughout the journey on public transport; even more annoying was that she still carried her knitting among the crowd gathered to see the King and Queen's carriage in the afternoon.</t4014>
<t4015>"You work very hard, madam," said the man next to her.</t4015>
<t4016>"Indeed," said Madam Defarge; "I have more work to do.</t4016><t4017>"</t4017>
<t4018>"What are you doing, madam?</t4018><t4019>"</t4019>
<t4020>"A lot.</t4020><t4021>"</t4021>
<t4022>"For example...</t4022><t4023>"</t4023>
<t4024>"For example," said Madam Defarge calmly, "shrouds.</t4024><t4025>"</t4025>
<t4026>Adam distanced himself from the woman at the first opportunity and the road worker waved his blue hat like a fan in his hand.</t4026> <t4027>The place was excessively crowded and suffocating.</t4027> <t4028>If he needed a King and Queen to find himself again, he was very lucky because the solution came to him; for soon the big-faced King and the clean-faced Queen arrived in their gilded carriage, accompanied by the dazzling group of the palace favorites with sparkling eyes, smiling ladies, and elegant lords; ladies and gentlemen in jewels, silks, and powders, bodies that disregarded everyone with all their splendor and grace, and well-groomed and arrogant faces; the road worker was so captivated and lost in all this that he started shouting, "Long live the King, Long live the Queen, Long live everyone and everything!" as if he was unaware of the Jacques who popped up everywhere at any moment in those days.</t4028> <t4029>Then gardens, courtyards, terraces, fountains, trees, flowers, and again the King and Queen, again the palace favorites, lords, and ladies; more Long live, and finally, unable to bear all this emotional intensity, he burst into tears.</t4029> <t4030>During this scene, which lasted about three hours, the road worker shouted a lot, cried, and showed accompanying emotional reactions, and throughout this time, Defarge held him tightly by the collar so that he wouldn't jump on the crowd he was declaring his loyalty to and tear them apart.</t4030>
<t4031>When everything was over, "Bravo!" said Defarge, patting the man on the back like a boss, "You are a good man!"</t4031>
<t4032>The road worker was coming to himself.</t4032> <t4033>He had started to come to himself now and was wondering if he had done anything wrong in his earlier performance, but there was no problem.</t4033>
<t4034>"You are the man we are looking for," said Defarge into the man's ear; "these fools think this grandeur will last forever.</t4034> <t4035>Then they become more arrogant and get closer and closer to the end.</t4035><t4036>"</t4036>
<t4037>"Yaa!" shouted the road worker; "very true!</t4037><t4038>"</t4038>
<t4039>"These fools know nothing.</t4039> <t4040>They can't stand your breathing, if it were possible, they would forever stop the breath of you and hundreds like you for one of their own horses or dogs, all they know is what your breath tells them.</t4040> <t4041>Let them believe this a little longer; it won't take much time anyway.</t4041><t4042>"</t4042>
<t4043>Madam Defarge looked at the customer with a proud demeanor and then nodded in approval.</t4043>
<t4044>"As for you," said the madam, "you cry and shout for all kinds of show and pomp.</t4044> <t4045>Isn't that right?</t4045> <t4046>Speak!"</t4046>
<t4047>"That's right, madam, I think so.</t4047> <t4048>For the moment, it seems that way.</t4048><t4049>"</t4049>
<t4050>"If they showed you a huge pile of babies and asked you to tear them apart and plunder them for your own benefit, you would go and choose the richest and sweetest one.</t4050> <t4051>Isn't that right?</t4051> <t4052>Tell me!</t4052><t4053>"</t4053>
<t4054>"Yes madam, that's correct."</t4054><t4055>"</t4055>
<t4056>"Yes, and if they showed you a flock of birds that couldn't fly and asked you to pluck their feathers for your own benefit, you would go and choose the ones with the most beautiful feathers; isn't that right?</t4056><t4057>"</t4057>
<t4058>"Yes, that's correct, madam."</t4058><t4059>"</t4059>
<t4060>"Today you saw both the babies and the birds," said Madam Defarge, extending her hand toward the area where they were last seen; "now, go home!</t4060><t4061>"</t4061>
<t4062>16</t4062>
<t4063>Continue Knitting</t4063>
<t4064>As Madam Defarge and her husband returned peacefully to the center of St. Antoine, they advanced through the darkness at a point with a blue hat, covering tiresome kilometers on dusty roads; they slowly headed towards the region where the château of Monsieur the Marquis, now lying in his grave, listened to the whispering rustle of the trees.</t4064> <t4065>They now had plenty of time to listen to the trees and the fountain with their stone faces, and when a handful of peasants, resembling scarecrows, reached the wide stone courtyard and the steps of the terrace while searching for grass to eat and twigs to burn, their hunger-stricken minds realized that the expressions on these faces had changed.</t4065> <t4066>According to a new rumor in the village – rumors as pale and feeble as the villagers themselves – when the knife was plunged, these faces also changed, turning from proud faces into ones filled with pain and anger; moreover, as the hanged body swung and changed direction ten meters above the fountain, the expressions changed again, adopting the cruel gaze of someone who had taken revenge, and they would remain that way forever.</t4066> <t4067>Two small indentations had appeared on the nose carved into the stone face above the large window of the bedroom where the murder was committed, everyone had noticed them, although no one had seen them before; occasionally, two or three ragged peasants would break away from the crowd to steal a glance at the petrified Monsieur the Marquis, and as soon as one of them extended a skinny finger towards it, they would all scurry away like wild rabbits through the moss and leaves, fleeing to places where they could feel at ease.</t4067>
<t4068>The castle and the hut, the stone face and the swinging body, the red stain on the stone floor, the pristine water in the village well – thousands of acres of land – all the countryside of France – the entirety of France – stretched out as a thin line under the dark sky.</t4068> <t4069>Even the whole world, with all its grandeur and smallness, was lying within a twinkling star.</t4069> <t4070>As if the ordinary human mind could dissect a beam of light and analyze its composition, thus the superior intellects could read the thoughts, behaviors, every kind of immorality, and virtue of every creature on our dimly shining world.</t4070>
<t4071>The Defarges, husband and wife, slowly made their way under the stars in their carriage and arrived at one of the gates of Paris, the point they aimed to reach.</t4071> <t4072>They were routinely stopped in front of the security barrier, and the usual lanterns were brightly shone on them for a general inspection and questioning.</t4072> <t4073>Monsieur Defarge got out of the carriage; he knew a couple of the soldiers and police officers there.</t4073> <t4074>He was familiar with the second one, and they embraced warmly.</t4074>
<t4075>St Antoine had once again embraced the Defarges with its dim wings, and as they finally got off the carriage near St Antoine and struggled to walk through the streets filled with pitch-black mud and filth, Madame Defarge said to her husband:</t4075>
<t4076>"Tell me, my friend; what did Officer Jacques say to you?</t4076><t4077>"</t4077>
<t4078>"He didn't say much tonight, but he told everything he knew.</t4078> <t4079>They have placed another spy in our region.</t4079> <t4080>There might be many more, but he only knew about one.</t4080><t4081>"</t4081>
<t4082>"Well, good!" said Madam Defarge, adopting a serious business air and raising her eyebrows.</t4082> <t4083>"We need to record that too.</t4083> <t4084>What's his name?"</t4084>
<t4085>"He is an Englishman.</t4085><t4086>"</t4086>
<t4087>"Better."</t4087> <t4088>"What's his name?"</t4088>
<t4089>"Barsad," said Defarge, pronouncing it as if it were French.</t4089> <t4090>But he had been so careful to understand the name correctly that he made no mistake when writing it.</t4090>
<t4091>"Barsad," repeated the madam.</t4091> <t4092>"Good.</t4092> <t4093>What is his first name?</t4093><t4094>"</t4094>
<t4095>"John.</t4095><t4096>"</t4096>
<t4097>After Madam muttered this to herself once, she repeated, "John Barsad."</t4097> <t4098>"Good.</t4098> <t4099>And his appearance; do we know it?</t4099><t4100>"</t4100>
<t4101>"Approximately in his forties, 1.75 meters tall, black-haired, dark-skinned, with a face that could be considered pleasant; dark eyes, a thin, long, pale face, a nose like a beak, but not straight, crooked to the left; this has given his face a rather sinister expression.</t4101><t4102>"</t4102>
<t4103>"God bless you.</t4103> <t4104>You practically painted the man's portrait!" said the lady, laughing.</t4104> <t4105>"It will be recorded immediately tomorrow."</t4105> <t4106>They returned to the closed (because it was night) wine shop, and Madam Defarge immediately took her place at the counter, counted the coins that had accumulated in her absence, checked the supplies, examined the ledger they kept, took other notes herself, and after thoroughly inspecting the wine distributor in every possible way, sent him to bed.</t4106> <t4107>Then she once again turned the money bowl upside down and, to keep it safe at night, placed the money in her handkerchief, tying several knots one after the other.</t4107> <t4108>Meanwhile, Monsieur Defarge, with his pipe in his mouth, walked up and down the shop with an indifferent admiration, but never interfered with his wife; in fact, this was true both in his business and family matters, he walked up and down in life.</t4108>
<t4109>It was a hot night, and the tightly shut shop in an already stinking neighborhood reeked horribly.</t4109> <t4110>Mr. Defarge's sense of smell was not very sensitive, but the smell of the wines in stock was many times sharper to his nose than their taste; likewise, the rum, cognac, and anise stock had a heavy odor.</t4110> <t4111>As he set aside his extinguished pipe, he puffed in disdain at this mixture of smells.</t4111>
<t4112>"You seem very tired," said the madam, looking at her husband while tying a knot in the handkerchief.</t4112> <t4113>"It smells like always.</t4113><t4114>"</t4114>
<t4115>"I am a bit tired, yes," admitted her husband.</t4115>
<t4116>"You seem a bit bored," said the madam; although her hurried eyes were intensely focused on the account, she couldn't help but glance at her husband from time to time.</t4116> <t4117>"Ah, these men, men!</t4117><t4118>"</t4118>
<t4119>"But my dear!" Defarge began to say.</t4119>
<t4120>"But my dear!" repeated the lady, shaking her head resolutely; "but my dear!</t4120> <t4121>You are so spiritless tonight, darling!</t4121><t4122>"</t4122>
<t4123>"Actually," said Defarge, as if an idea had been torn from his chest, "it took a very long time.</t4123><t4124>"</t4124>
<t4125>His wife repeated, "It took too long; when did it not take long?</t4125> <t4126>Revenge and retaliation take a long time; that's how it is.</t4126><t4127>"</t4127>
<t4128>"A lightning strike doesn't last very long, though," said Defarge.</t4128>
<t4129>"Tell me," said the madam calmly, "How long does it take to produce and gather lightning?</t4129><t4130>"</t4130>
<t4131>Defarge, as if he had something on his mind, raised his head thoughtfully.</t4131>
<t4132>"It doesn't take long for an earthquake to swallow a city," said the madam.</t4132> <t4133>"But how long does it take to prepare for that earthquake, you tell me that?"</t4133><t4134>"</t4134>
<t4135>"It will probably take a long time," said Defarge.</t4135>
<t4136>"But when it is ready and comes to life, it will shatter everything in its path.</t4136> <t4137>Even if we hear or see nothing, it is constantly preparing right now.</t4137> <t4138>Take comfort in this.</t4138> <t4139>Do not forget it.</t4139><t4140>"</t4140>
<t4141>With eyes gleaming as if he were strangling an enemy, he tied another knot.</t4141>
<t4142>"Let me tell you this much," he said, extending his right hand to emphasize what he was about to say, "the journey may have been long, but that journey is coming to an end now.</t4142> <t4143>I'm telling you, it will never retreat and it will never stop.</t4143> <t4144>I'm telling you, it will always move forward.</t4144> <t4145>Take a look around and think of all the faces you know, think of all those Jacques' growing anger and discontent with each passing day.</t4145> <t4146>How much longer will this continue?</t4146> <t4147>Hah! Don't worry about it anymore.</t4147><t4148>"</t4148>
<t4149>"My brave wife," said Defarge, with his head tilted to the side in front of his wife, his hands tied behind his back, like a well-behaved and good child being questioned by a religious teacher, "I am not questioning these things.</t4149> <t4150>But it took a very long time and maybe we won't live to see it – you know, my dear wife, this is possible.</t4150><t4151>"</t4151>
<t4152>"Hey! What does this mean now?" asked the madam, tying another knot as if she were strangling another enemy.</t4152>
<t4153>"Well!" said Defarge, shrugging his shoulders with a manner that was partly complaining, partly apologetic.</t4153> <t4154>"We may not see the victory.</t4154><t4155>"</t4155>
<t4156>"But we will be helping her," replied the madam, extending her hands with a determined gesture.</t4156> <t4157>"Nothing we do is in vain.</t4157> <t4158>I wholeheartedly believe that we will see the victory.</t4158> <t4159>But even if we won't see those days, even if we have no hope left, show me the throat of a cruel ruler or noble, and I will still...</t4159><t4160>"</t4160>
<t4161>Then, Madam clenched her teeth and tied another tight knot with all her might.</t4161>
<t4162>Feeling accused of cowardice and blushing slightly, Defarge said to his wife, "Hold on, dear! I am not afraid of anything either.</t4162><t4163>"</t4163>
<t4164>"Correct!</t4164> <t4165>But your weakness is feeling the need to see your victim and the opportunity in your hand in order to continue on your path.</t4165> <t4166>Continue on your path without these.</t4166> <t4167>When the time comes, you will reveal the tiger and the devil within you; but for now, keep the tiger and the devil chained inside you –don't show them to anyone– yet always keep them ready.</t4167><t4168>"</t4168>
<t4169>Madam, to increase the impact of her words, slammed her handkerchief full of money on the counter as if she were scattering her brains, then very calmly tucked the now heavier handkerchief under her arm and said it was time to go to bed.</t4169>
<t4170>The next day at noon, this admirable woman was once again knitting with great determination in her usual spot at the wine shop.</t4170> <t4171>There was a rose beside her, and although she occasionally glanced at the flower, her usual demeanor never changed.</t4171> <t4172>A few customers, some drinking, some not, some standing, some sitting, were scattered around the shop.</t4172> <t4173>It was a very hot day; swarms of flies, which had extended their curious and adventurous searches to the sticky little glasses next to the lady, had fallen to the bottoms of the glasses one by one and died.</t4173> <t4174>The other flies buzzing around did not seem at all affected by their deaths; they just looked at them with the utmost composure (as if they themselves were elephants or some other equally unrelated animal) until they shared the same fate.</t4174> <t4175>How carefree flies are! –perhaps on that hot summer day, they could think no more than the Palace people.</t4175>
<t4176>Then, a person who entered cast his shadow over Madam Defarge; it was a type completely unfamiliar to the madam.</t4176> <t4177>Madam put aside her knitting and pinned her rose to the edge of her bonnet before attending to the man.</t4177>
<t4178>It was a strange situation.</t4178> <t4179>With Madam Defarge raising her rose, the customers had stopped talking and started leaving the shop one by one.</t4179>
<t4180>"Good day, madam," said the stranger.</t4180>
<t4181>"Good day, monsieur."</t4181><t4182>"</t4182>
<t4183>She said this out loud, but when she took her knitting back in hand, she muttered to herself: "Ha! Good days, at forty years old, 1.75 meters tall, black hair, dark skin, generally a face that could be called pleasant; dark eyes, thin, long, pale face, nose like a beak but not straight, crooked to the left; this gave her a rather untrustworthy expression!</t4183> <t4184>Good day to you all!</t4184><t4185>"</t4185>
<t4186>"Could you please give me a small glass of old cognac and a large glass of cold water, madam?</t4186><t4187>"</t4187>
<t4188>The lady graciously fulfilled the man's request.</t4188>
<t4189>"This is a magnificent cognac, madam!"</t4189><t4190>"</t4190>
<t4191>The cognac had never been praised so highly before, and Madam Defarge knew well the state of the previous ones.</t4191> <t4192>Nevertheless, she told the man that he had praised the cognac too much and resumed her knitting.</t4192> <t4193>After watching the woman's fingers for a few minutes, the stranger glanced around.</t4193>
<t4194>"How beautifully you knit, madam."</t4194><t4195>"</t4195>
<t4196>"I'm used to it now.</t4196><t4197>"</t4197>
<t4198>"What a beautiful pattern it is!"</t4198><t4199>"</t4199>
<t4200>"Do you think so?" said the madam, looking at him with a smile on her face.</t4200>
<t4201>"Absolutely.</t4201> <t4202>May I ask what you are knitting?</t4202><t4203>"</t4203>
<t4204>"I'm just keeping myself busy," said the woman, her fingers moving quickly, still with a smile on her face, looking at him.</t4204>
<t4205>"So, you're not knitting anything specific?</t4205><t4206>"</t4206>
<t4207>"It depends on the situation."</t4207> <t4208>"One day it might be useful."</t4208> <t4209>"If I finish it..."</t4209> <t4210>"well," said the madam, sighing and shaking her head with a cruel flirtation, "I'll use it!"</t4210><t4211>"</t4211>
<t4212>It was a remarkable situation.</t4212> <t4213>The taste of St. Antoine seemed to be in direct contrast with the rose on Madame Defarge's cap.</t4213> <t4214>Two men had entered separately, and just as they were about to order their drinks, their eyes caught this change, causing them to hesitate, and then they left, pretending not to look at a friend who wasn't there.</t4214> <t4215>In fact, when this stranger entered, only one person remained from those who were already there.</t4215> <t4216>Everyone else had left.</t4216> <t4217>The spy had kept his eyes wide open but had found nothing.</t4217> <t4218>People had left the shop in a manner that aroused no suspicion, sluggishly, in their miserable, aimless, and random states.</t4218>
<t4219>Her fingers knitting furiously and her eyes on the stranger, while working her patterns, the lady thought to herself, "JOHN."</t4219> <t4220>"Stay a little longer so that I can knit 'BARSAD' before you leave."</t4220><t4221>"</t4221>
<t4222>"Are you married, madam?"</t4222><t4223>"</t4223>
<t4224>"Yes.</t4224><t4225>"</t4225>
<t4226>"Do you have children?</t4226><t4227>"</t4227>
<t4228>"No.</t4228><t4229>"</t4229>
<t4230>"Things are probably going badly?</t4230><t4231>"</t4231>
<t4232>"Things are bad; people are very poor."</t4232><t4233>"</t4233>
<t4234>"Oh unfortunate and miserable people!</t4234> <t4235>Moreover, there is so much pressure on them – as you said.</t4235><t4236>"</t4236>
<t4237>"As you said," the lady immediately corrected, and skillfully wove something ominous next to the man's name.</t4237>
<t4238>"Ah, pardon; I was the one who said that, of course, but you must be thinking the same thing."</t4238> <t4239>"Certainly."</t4239><t4240>"</t4240>
<t4241>"Is that so?" replied the madam loudly.</t4241> <t4242>"We have no time to think from trying to keep this wine shop running with my husband.</t4242> <t4243>The only thing we think about here is how we will live.</t4243> <t4244>That's our whole concern, so our minds are occupied with many things day and night, we have no state to think about others.</t4244> <t4245>How are other people doing?</t4245> <t4246>There's nothing to be done.</t4246><t4247>"</t4247>
<t4248>The spy, who was there to gather the smallest crumb of information he could find, had managed not to let his astonishment show on his sinister face, but as he leaned his elbow on Madame Defarge's small counter and sipped his cognac little by little, he still stood there with the air of a gossiping hero.</t4248>
<t4249>"This is very bad, madam, I mean Gaspard's execution.</t4249> <t4250>Oh! Poor Gaspard!" she said, sighing deeply with sorrow.</t4250>
<t4251>"Peace!" said the madam with a calm and carefree demeanor, "if people use knives for such purposes, they must bear the consequences.</t4251> <t4252>He knew what this behavior would cost and he paid for it."</t4252> <t4253>The spy, "If you ask me," he said, giving his voice a softness that evoked confidence and adding a revolutionary sensitivity to every nerve of his mischievous face; "If you ask me, the people in this neighborhood are filled with great compassion and anger because of this poor man.</t4253> <t4254>Let's keep it between us.</t4254><t4255>"</t4255>
<t4256>"Is that so?" said the madam, with empty eyes.</t4256>
<t4257>"Isn't that so?</t4257><t4258>"</t4258>
<t4259>"..."</t4259> <t4260>"Here comes my husband!" said Madam Defarge.</t4260>
<t4261>When the owner of the wine shop walked in through the door, the spy touched his hat and greeted him, smiling sympathetically, "Good day, Jacques!" he said.</t4261> <t4262>Defarge stayed where he was and fixed his eyes on the man.</t4262>
<t4263>"Good day, Jacques!" repeated the spy, but under these gazes, the confidence in his voice and the smile on his face had weakened.</t4263>
<t4264>"There is a mistake, monsieur," replied the owner of the wine shop.</t4264> <t4265>"You must have confused me with someone else.</t4265> <t4266>I am not Jacques.</t4266> <t4267>My name is Ernest Defarge.</t4267><t4268>"</t4268>
<t4269>"What difference does it make," said the spy in a flippant manner but was annoyed, "still, have a good day!</t4269><t4270>"</t4270>
<t4271>"Good day!" said Defarge emotionlessly.</t4271>
<t4272>"When you came in, I was telling the lady with whom I had the pleasure of conversing that St. Antoine was seething with pain and anger due to the poor fate of unfortunate Gaspard – and rightly so!</t4272><t4273>"</t4273>
<t4274>"I have never heard of such a thing," said Defarge, shaking his head from side to side.</t4274> <t4275>"I have no idea."</t4275><t4276>"</t4276>
<t4277>After saying this, Defarge went behind the small counter and stood there with his hand on the back of his wife's chair, both of them scrutinizing the man standing directly in front of them, whom they would drown in a spoonful of water if they could.</t4277>
<t4278>The spy, who had now mastered his craft, still acted as if he was unaware of anything; he had finished his glass of cognac, taken a sip of water, and asked for another glass of cognac.</t4278> <t4279>Madam Defarge filled the man's glass, took up her knitting again, and started to hum a song.</t4279>
<t4280>"It seems you know this area even better than I do, huh?" said Defarge.</t4280>
<t4281>"No, not really, but I want to learn better.</t4281> <t4282>I have a deep interest in the wretched inhabitants of these parts.</t4282><t4283>"</t4283>
<t4284>"Hmph!" grumbled Defarge.</t4284>
<t4285>"Monsieur Defarge, the happiness of speaking with you has given me the honor of recalling some individuals associated with your name," the spy continued.</t4285>
<t4286>"Is that so!" said Defarge, with a rather indifferent attitude.</t4286>
<t4287>"Yes, yes.</t4287> <t4288>When Doctor Manette was released,</t4288>
<t4289>I know that you took care of him as his former servant.</t4289> <t4290>They brought him to you.</t4290> <t4291>As you can see, I am aware of what happened.</t4291><t4292>"</t4292>
<t4293>"That's right!" said Defarge.</t4293> <t4294>His wife, while knitting, had accidentally nudged him with her elbow</t4294> <t4295>and murmured like a song that it would be good to give a quick answer without prolonging the conversation.</t4295>
<t4296>"The girl had come to you," said the spy, "and she had taken her away from you, accompanied by a gentleman in a neat brown suit; what was his name? –he had a small wig on his head –Lorry from Tellson and Company– from England.</t4296><t4297>"</t4297>
<t4298>"It is true," repeated Defarge.</t4298>
<t4299>"Very interesting things have stayed in my mind!" said the spy.</t4299> <t4300>"I had met Doctor Manette and his daughter in England.</t4300><t4301>"</t4301>
<t4302>"Is that so?" said Defarge.</t4302>
<t4303>"Don't you receive news from them anymore?" said the spy.</t4303>
<t4304>"No," said Defarge.</t4304>
<t4305>"Actually," Madam Defarge interjected, lifting her head from her work and pausing her song, "we can no longer hear from them.</t4305> <t4306>We had heard that they arrived safely, then we received one or two more letters, but after that, they went their way, we went ours, and our connection was completely severed.</t4306>
<t4307>"You are right, madam," replied the spy.</t4307> <t4308>"The doctor's daughter is going to get married soon.</t4308><t4309>"</t4309>
<t4310>"Is she going to get married?" repeated the madam.</t4310> <t4311>"She was such a lovely girl that I thought she must have already gotten married."</t4311> <t4312>"I think you English people are quite cold too."</t4312><t4313>"</t4313>
<t4314>"Aaa! How do you know that I am English?"</t4314><t4315>"</t4315>
<t4316>"I understood your language," replied the madam, "and to me, a person is what their language is.</t4316><t4317>"</t4317>
<t4318>Although Casus did not see this observation as a compliment.</t4318> <t4319>he did not show that he was upset and brushed it off with a laugh.</t4319> <t4320>Then he downed the cognac and said:</t4320>
<t4321>"Yes, Miss Manette is getting married.</t4321> <t4322>But not to an Englishman; to someone who, like her, is French by birth.</t4322> <t4323>Speaking of Gaspard (oh poor Gaspard! What a great cruelty, it was terrible!) how strange it is that Miss Manette is going to marry Monsieur Marquis's nephew, that is, the person who caused Gaspard to hang so many meters above; in other words, the new Marquis, Mr. Charles Darnay – his mother's maiden name was also D'Aulnais.</t4323><t4324>"</t4324>
<t4325>Madam Defarge was still knitting resolutely, but the news she had received had a visible effect on her husband.</t4325> <t4326>It was evident from his every move that he was struggling as he lit his pipe behind the small counter, his hands trembling.</t4326> <t4327>If the spy had missed this or failed to note it in his mind, he wouldn't be called a spy.</t4327>
<t4328>Although it was not very clear what Defarge's state proved, at least the spy had managed to hit him from somewhere, and since there were no other customers around to come to his aid with another piece of evidence, Mr. Barsad paid for his drinks and left the shop.</t4328> <t4329>Before leaving, he created an opportunity and in a polite manner.</t4329> <t4330>He did not forget to mention that he would be happy to see Monsieur and Madame Defarge again and that he was looking forward to it.</t4330> <t4331>Even after the spy had moved far away from St. Antoine, the couple waited in the same position for a while, in case he might return.</t4331>
<t4332>"I wonder," said Defarge in a low voice, standing behind his wife's chair, looking at her while puffing on his pipe, "could what the man said about Mademoiselle Manette be true?</t4332><t4333>"</t4333>
<t4334>"According to what he said," said the madam, raising her eyebrows slightly, "it is probably wrong.</t4334> <t4335>But it could also be right.</t4335><t4336>"</t4336>
<t4337>"If it's true," Defarge started to say, but fell silent.</t4337>
<t4338>"What if it's true?" his wife repeated.</t4338>
<t4339>"..."</t4339> <t4340>If it is true and we can see the victory – for the girl's sake, I hope Fate keeps her husband away from France.</t4340><t4341>"</t4341>
<t4342>"Whatever her husband's fate is," said Madame Defarge with her usual calmness, "it will take him to where he is destined to go, that is, to the end that will finish him."</t4342> <t4343>That's all I know.</t4343><t4344>"</t4344>
<t4345>Defarge, "But this is very strange – I mean, at least for now, isn't it very strange?" he said to his wife, almost as if begging for her to agree with him, "look, while feeling so much sympathy for her father and herself, you will now trap her future husband's name, the one who just left the shop, in your knitting next to that wretched dog?</t4345><t4346>"</t4346>
<t4347>"When the day we've been waiting for comes, we will see even stranger things," replied the madam.</t4347> <t4348>"I wrote both of them here, they will stay forever, and they both deserved this; that's enough."</t4348><t4349>"</t4349>
<t4350>After saying these words, she gathered her knitting and immediately removed the rose from the side of her head.</t4350> <t4351>The people of St. Antoine either instinctively felt that this troublesome ornament had been removed or had witnessed its disappearance firsthand; whatever the case, the neighborhood residents suddenly rushed in, and the wine shop returned to its usual state.</t4351>
<t4352>In the evening, the people of St. Antoine once again took to the streets to get some fresh air, sitting on doorsteps and window sills, and emerging into the miserable street corners and courtyards. Madame Defarge, with her work in hand, was accustomed to wandering from one group to another.</t4352> <t4353>A woman who was a Missionary – there were many like her – was knitting furiously.</t4353> <t4354>All the women were knitting.</t4354> <t4355>They were knitting unnecessary things, but this mechanical work served as a substitute for eating and drinking; instead of jaws and digestive systems, their hands were working; if their skinny fingers were to stop, their stomachs would shrink even more.</t4355>
<t4356>As the fingers worked, the eyes also worked, and of course, so did the minds.</t4356> <t4357>As Madame Defarge moved from one group to another, this trio became increasingly faster and more determined in each small group of women that Madame spoke to and left behind.</t4357>
<t4358>Her husband was smoking a cigarette in front of the door, looking at his wife with admiration.</t4358><t4359>"What an amazing woman," he said, "a strong, great, incredibly great woman this is!" he was saying.</t4359>
<t4360>Darkness had enveloped the surroundings, and while the women sat knitting furiously, the church bells rang and the distant sounds of the soldiers' drums in the Palace courtyard could be heard.</t4360> <t4361>The darkness had settled heavily upon them.</t4361> <t4362>As the church bells rang – these bells that sweetly chimed from the towers rising over France would later blend with the sound of thundering cannons – another darkness was approaching with sure steps; the military drums that needed to be played to drown out the wretched voices would beat that night for "Power and Abundance, Freedom and Life."</t4362> <t4363>The women who ceaselessly knitted as they sat were very close to their destination, now surrounding an unfinished structure where they would sit knitting and counting the heads being executed.</t4363>
<t4364>XVII</t4364>
<t4365>One Night</t4365>
<t4366>The sun had never set with such a bright halo in that quiet corner of Soho as it did on that unforgettable evening when the Doctor and his daughter sat together under the plane tree.</t4366> <t4367>While the father and daughter sat under the tree, the moon, which shone on their faces through the leaves, had never risen over the vast London with such a sweet brightness as it did that evening.</t4367>
<t4368>Lude was going to get married the next day.</t4368> <t4369>She had reserved the last evening for her father, and they were sitting together under the sycamore tree.</t4369>
<t4370>"Are you happy, daddy?</t4370><t4371>"</t4371>
<t4372>"Yes, my child."</t4372><t4373>"</t4373>
<t4374>Although they had been there for a while, they had spoken very little.</t4374> <t4375>Even when there was still enough light to work or read something, Lucie had neither devoted herself to her task nor read a book to her father.</t4375> <t4376>She had often idled like this before, under the tree, beside her father, but this evening was not like the others, it couldn't be.</t4376>
<t4377>"I am very happy tonight, Daddy.</t4377> <t4378>This love –my love for Charles and Charles's love for me– makes me deeply happy.</t4378> <t4379>But if I still couldn't dedicate my life to you or if my marriage, even if just a few streets away, would separate me from you, you can't imagine how unhappy I would be, how bad I would feel.</t4379> <t4380>Actually, even right now-"</t4380>
<t4381>At that moment, the young girl couldn't control her voice.</t4381>
<t4382>In the melancholy moonlight, the young girl hugged her father's neck and rested her head on his chest.</t4382> <t4383>The moonlight, which always disappeared with the emergence of daylight – that light which calls people to life – was always melancholic anyway.</t4383>
<t4384>"Dear father!</t4384> <t4385>Would you tell me once more that you are sure the new loves and new duties entering my life will never come between us?</t4385> <t4386>I am sure of this, but do you think the same?</t4386> <t4387>Do you believe this wholeheartedly?</t4387><t4388>"</t4388>
<t4389>Her father replied with a sincere certainty to persuade his daughter, "Of course I'm sure, my dear!</t4389> <t4390>Moreover," he added while kissing his daughter affectionately, "with your marriage, my future will be much brighter, Lucie – more than ever before.</t4390><t4391>"</t4391>
<t4392>"Oh, I hope it will be like that, daddy!"</t4392><t4393>"</t4393>
<t4394>"Believe me, my dear!</t4394> <t4395>This is the truth.</t4395> <t4396>Think about how natural and right this situation is, this is how it should be.</t4396> <t4397>You can't understand how much it upsets me to think that you, with your youthful and self-sacrificing nature, would waste your life..."</t4397> <t4398>The girl brought her hand to her father's lips, but he pulled her hand away and repeated his words.</t4398>
<t4399>"...</t4399> <t4400>you must not waste your life, my child – you must not go against the laws of nature and waste your own life for my sake.</t4400> <t4401>You are so self-sacrificing towards me that you cannot fully understand what goes through my mind, but think about it, how can my happiness be complete when yours is lacking?</t4401><t4402>"</t4402>
<t4403>"If I hadn't known Charles, I would have lived quite happily with you, father.</t4403><t4404>"</t4404>
<t4405>The doctor smiled and responded with a confession, made unwittingly by his daughter, that revealed she could not be happy without Charles:</t4405>
<t4406>"My dear, the one you encountered was Charles.</t4406> <t4407>If it hadn't been Charles, it would have been someone else.</t4407> <t4408>On the other hand, if it hadn't been someone else, it would have been something that originated from me, and then the shadow of the dark part of my life would have surpassed me and fallen upon you.</t4408><t4409>"</t4409>
<t4410>For the first time since the trial, Lucie was hearing him speak of those painful days.</t4410> <t4411>Her father's words had stirred a strange and new feeling within her, and this feeling lingered in her mind for a long time.</t4411>
<t4412>The Doctor from Beauvais said, "Look!" pointing at the moon.</t4412> <t4413>"Even though I couldn't bear its light, I would always look at it from the window of my dungeon.</t4413> <t4414>Thinking that it shone over what I had lost would hurt me so much inside that I would bang my head against the walls of the dungeon as I looked.</t4414> <t4415>While staring with numb and lifeless eyes, I wouldn't think of anything else, only calculating the number of horizontal lines I could draw over it and the number of vertical lines that would intersect with them."</t4415> <t4416>While gazing at the moon, lost in deep thoughts, he added, "I remember twenty horizontal, twenty vertical, and fitting the twentieth was difficult.</t4416><t4417>"</t4417>
<t4418>As he reminisced about the old days, his father's strange excitement also deepened, but there was nothing surprising about him talking about these things.</t4418> <t4419>It was as if he was comparing his current happiness and joy with his dreadful patience in the past.</t4419>
<t4420>"While looking at the moon, I thought of my unborn child thousands of times.</t4420> <t4421>Had it been born, I wondered?</t4421> <t4422>Had it been born healthy, or had it died from its poor mother's sorrow?</t4422> <t4423>Or was it a boy who would one day avenge his father?</t4423> <t4424>(During the days I was in prison, my desire for revenge had become unbearable.</t4424><t4425>)</t4425> <t4426>A boy who would never know his father's story; or perhaps he would even think that his father had disappeared of his own will and volition.</t4426> <t4427>Or it was a girl who would grow up to be a beautiful woman.</t4427><t4428>"</t4428>
<t4429>Lucie approached her father and kissed his cheek and hand.</t4429>
<t4430>"I always thought to myself that my daughter had completely forgotten me – even imagined that she was entirely unaware of me, that she never knew me.</t4430> <t4431>I kept calculating her age every year.</t4431> <t4432>I envisioned her marrying a man who knew nothing of my fate.</t4432> <t4433>I had been completely erased from the memories of the living and had no place in the next generation.</t4433><t4434>"</t4434>
<t4435>"Daddy! The fact that you have thought about these things for a girl who doesn't exist, it burns my heart as if I were that child."</t4435><t4436>"</t4436>
<t4437>"Lucie, all these memories came alive after you comforted and healed me, and on this last night, they came between me and the moon.</t4437> <t4438>–What was I saying?</t4438><t4439>"</t4439>
<t4440>"He knew nothing about you.</t4440> <t4441>He had no idea about you.</t4441><t4442>"</t4442>
<t4443>"Correct!</t4443> <t4444>But on other nights when the moon shone, when sadness and silence affected me differently –like every emotion that is fundamentally the most painful, it affected me with a feeling similar to sorrowful peace– I would imagine her coming to my cell and taking me to freedom beyond the prison walls.</t4444> <t4445>Just as I see you now, I would often see her in the moonlight, but I could never hold her in my arms; she would stand between the small window with iron bars and the door.</t4445> <t4446>But you understand that the child I mentioned is not her, right?</t4446><t4447>"</t4447>
<t4448>"Was that image a symbol, a dream?"</t4448><t4449>"</t4449>
<t4450>"No.</t4450> <t4451>This was something else.</t4451> <t4452>It stood in my line of sight in a disturbing way but didn't move at all.</t4452> <t4453>The silhouette my mind was chasing was very different, a much more real child.</t4453> <t4454>About its appearance, I know nothing except that it resembled its mother.</t4454> <t4455>The other one also looked like it – just like you – but it wasn't the same.</t4455> <t4456>Can you follow what I'm saying, Lucie?</t4456> <t4457>It's a bit difficult, isn't it?</t4457> <t4458>Maybe you had to be left alone in a dungeon to understand these complex distinctions.</t4458><t4459>"</t4459>
<t4460>The doctor's composed and calm demeanor, adopted in an effort to return to the old days, was enough to chill his daughter's blood.</t4460>
<t4461>"In relatively peaceful moments, I would imagine her coming to me in the moonlight and dream that she would take me to her nest to show me that it was filled with the loving memories of her deceased father.</t4461> <t4462>My picture would be in her room and she would pray for me.</t4462> <t4463>She was full of life, cheerful, and beautiful, but my pitiful story had permeated everywhere.</t4463><t4464>"</t4464>
<t4465>"Here I am, that child, my father.</t4465> <t4466>My life wasn't that good, but I loved you just the same.</t4466><t4467>"</t4467>
<t4468>"Then he would show me his children," said the Doctor from Beauvais, "they knew about me and had taught me to pity them.</t4468> <t4469>When they passed by a prison, they were kept away from its frowning walls and would look at the iron bars and whisper among themselves.</t4469> <t4470>My daughter could not set me free, but after showing me all this, I imagined she would take me back to my cell.</t4470> <t4471>Then I would relax and burst into tears, kneeling down to pray for her.</t4471><t4472>"</t4472>
<t4473>"I am that child, father, oh I hope so, my dear father."</t4473> <t4474>"Oh my dear father, my beloved father, will you pray for me with the same enthusiasm again tomorrow?"</t4474><t4475>"</t4475>
<t4476>"Lucie, the reason I am telling you all these old troubles now is because I love you more than words can express and I thank God for giving me such great happiness.</t4476> <t4477>Even in the moments when I indulged in the most impossible dreams, I could not have imagined the happiness I feel now by your side and the beautiful days that lie ahead of us.</t4477><t4478>"</t4478>
<t4479>The doctor hugged his daughter, solemnly entrusted her to God, and humbly thanked for being granted his daughter.</t4479> <t4480>A little later, they entered the house.</t4480>
<t4481>There was no one invited to the wedding except Mr. Lorry; there wasn't even a bridesmaid other than the unpleasant Miss Pross.</t4481> <t4482>There would be no change in the place where they lived after the marriage; they had only expanded the house a bit, incorporating the rooms on the upper floor that previously belonged to the invisible imaginary tenant, and felt no need to do anything else.</t4482>
<t4483>Dr. Manette was very cheerful at dinner.</t4483> <t4484>There were only three people at the table; the third person was Miss Pross, after all.</t4484> <t4485>The Doctor was saddened by Charles's absence; he was almost going to oppose the loving little game that kept his almost-son-in-law away that day, and with these affectionate feelings, he raised his glass in his honor.</t4485>
<t4486>Then it was time for the Doctor to say goodnight to Lucie, and everyone retired to their rooms.</t4486> <t4487>But in the silence of the later hours of the night, Lucie came back downstairs and secretly entered her father's room; she had a multitude of fears she couldn't define.</t4487>
<t4488>However, everything was in its place; not a sound was heard and her father was sleeping soundly, his snow-white hair was worth watching on his comfortable pillow and his hands were lying still on the bedspread.</t4488> <t4489>The young girl placed the unnecessary candlestick somewhere away and, snuggling up to her father, planted a kiss on his lips; then she leaned over and looked at him.</t4489>
<t4490>The man's pleasant face had been worn down by the bitter waters of captivity, but the doctor had covered these marks with such strong determination that he managed to conceal them even in his sleep.</t4490> <t4491>That night, if all the faces in the realm of sleep were examined, none could be found as silent, as determined, and as cautious as his, in his struggle against an invisible aggressor.</t4491>
<t4492>Lucie timidly placed her hand on her father's chest and prayed to always be able to stay by his side, after all the love she felt for him and all the suffering the man had endured.</t4492> <t4493>Then she withdrew her hand and, after kissing him on the lips once more, she left.</t4493> <t4494>The sun had now risen, and the shadows of the plane tree's leaves played softly on the man's face, as gently as his daughter's lips moved while she prayed for him.</t4494>
<t4495>XVIII</t4495>
<t4496>Nine Days</t4496>
<t4497>On the wedding day, the weather was sparkling, and everyone was waiting in front of the closed door of the room where the Doctor was talking to Charles Darnay.</t4497> <t4498>They were all ready to go to the church; that is, the beautiful bride, Mr. Lorry, and Miss Pross – Miss Pross, who had gradually accustomed herself to this inevitable event, was happy indeed, but she still couldn't get rid of the thought that the groom should have been her own brother Solomon.</t4498>
<t4499>"Do you see?" said Mr. Lorry, who couldn't stop praising the bride, as he circled around her lovely, simple wedding dress; "Sweet Lucie, so I brought you across the Channel for this, oh how beautiful you are!</t4499> <t4500>Thank God!</t4500> <t4501>I didn't realize I was doing something so important!</t4501> <t4502>I didn't understand the significance of the task I entrusted to my friend Charles so well!</t4502><t4503>"</t4503>
<t4504>"You had no such intention," said the straightforward Miss Pross, "how could you have known?</t4504> <t4505>Nonsense!"</t4505>
<t4506>"Is that so?</t4506> <t4507>Alright, but don't cry," said the gentle Mr. Lorry.</t4507>
<t4508>"I am not crying," said Miss Pross; "it is you who are crying.</t4508><t4509>"</t4509>
<t4510>"Am I my Pross?" (Mr. Lorry had now found the courage to address her more intimately, given the situation.</t4510><t4511>)</t4511>
<t4512>"Yes, you were crying just a moment ago, I saw you and I wasn't surprised at all.</t4512> <t4513>You gave them such a beautiful dinner set that anyone who sees it would be moved to tears.</t4513> <t4514>Every fork and spoon in this set," said Miss Pross, "brought me to tears, I cried so much after the box arrived last night that I couldn't see.</t4514><t4515>"</t4515>
<t4516>"I am very happy," said Mr. Lorry, "but it was not my intention to blind your eyes with these insignificant objects that I gave as a memento."</t4516> <t4517>Ah, yes! In such situations, one realizes all the things they have lost.</t4517> <t4518>Ahh, ah! Now, by my side, there could have been a wife of fifty years, a Mrs. Lorry!</t4518><t4519>"</t4519>
<t4520>"It couldn't be!" came a response from Miss Pross.</t4520>
<t4521>"Do you think that there could never be a Ms. Lorry in my life?"</t4521><t4522>"</t4522>
<t4523>"Hmph!" said Miss Pross; "you are a born bachelor.</t4523><t4524>"</t4524>
<t4525>"Eee!" said Mr. Lorry, his eyes laughing as he adjusted his small wig, "you might be right.</t4525><t4526>"</t4526>
<t4527>"It was determined that you would remain single while you were still lying in your cradle," added Miss Pross.</t4527>
<t4528>"Then I think there is a mistake in this matter, I should have been given a say in my own life.</t4528> <t4529>Anyway! Now, dear Lucie," said Mr. Lorry, gently wrapping his arm around Lucie's waist.</t4529> <t4530>"I can hear their voices from inside, and Miss Pross and I, as knowledgeable individuals, do not want to miss the opportunity to tell you the things you want to hear.</t4530> <t4531>You are leaving your dear father in hands as sincere and compassionate as yours, my beautiful girl; he will be very well taken care of; for the next two weeks, while you are in Warwickshire and its surroundings, even Tellson's is of no importance (compared to him).</t4531> <t4532>At the end of these two weeks, when your father comes to you and your dear husband for the other two weeks you will spend in Wales, you will see how healthy and happy we have sent him to you.</t4532> <t4533>It seems someone is approaching the door.</t4533> <t4534>Before someone else comes and kisses her, let me kiss my dear girl."</t4534> <t4535>To look at that familiar expression on her forehead,</t4535> <t4536>he held her beautiful face in his hands for a moment, then, with a tenderness and delicacy as old as Adam and Eve, he rested her golden hair against his own small brown wig.</t4536>
<t4537>The door of the Doctor's room opened and the Doctor and Charles Darnay came out.</t4537> <t4538>The Doctor's face was so pale – it hadn't been like that when he went in – that there wasn't the slightest hint of color, yet although his demeanor was the same, Mr. Lorry's keen eye did not miss that the feeling of avoiding and fearing everything that used to envelop the Doctor had passed like a faint cold breeze.</t4538>
<t4539>The doctor took his daughter by the arm and led her down the stairs to the carriage that Mr. Lorry had hired in honor of the day.</t4539> <t4540>The others followed them in another carriage, and a little later, Charles Darnay and Lucie Manette were happily married in a nearby church, away from prying eyes.</t4540>
<t4541>When the wedding ended, alongside the sparkling tears among the smiling faces of the small gathering, the diamonds that had just emerged from the dark mystery of Mr. Lorry's pocket were also shining brightly in the bride's hand.</t4541>
<t4542>They returned home for breakfast; everything went well and just as the golden hair had mingled with the curls of the poor shoemaker's white hair in the attic in Paris, now, as they were saying goodbye at the doorstep, it mingled in the morning sunlight.</t4542>
<t4543>Although it wouldn't be a long separation, it was a difficult farewell.</t4543> <t4544>But her father had managed to cheer her up, and finally, as he gently extricated himself from her embracing arms, he said, "Come on, take her Charles! My daughter is yours now!"</t4544>
<t4545>Lucie waved excitedly to them from the car window, and then the car disappeared from sight.</t4545>
<t4546>Due to the house being in a corner away from idle types and the curious, and because the wedding preparations were simple and minimal, Doctor, Mr. Lorry, and Miss Pross were left alone as the car departed.</t4546> <t4547>When they entered the shadow of the cool, old hall, Mr. Lorry noticed the significant change in the Doctor; it was as if the golden arm standing there had suddenly delivered a poisonous punch to him.</t4547>
<t4548>The doctor had naturally suppressed many emotions within himself, and it was not at all surprising that there was a sudden change in him with the disappearance of the source of pressure; on the other hand, what really worried Mr. Lorry was the old fearful, lost expression on the man's face. Moreover, when they went upstairs, the doctor absentmindedly took his head in his hands and wandered around his room sorrowfully, which reminded Mr. Lorry of Defarge, the owner of the wine shop, and their progress along the star-lit road.</t4548>
<t4549>After thinking uneasily, Mr. Lorry whispered to Miss Pross, "I think," he said, "I think we shouldn't talk to him now, or even disturb him at all.</t4549> <t4550>I need to go to Tellson's; I'll just go and come back quickly.</t4550> <t4551>Then we can take him for a walk in the countryside, have a meal somewhere around there, it will do us all good.</t4551><t4552>"</t4552>
<t4553>For Mr. Lorry, going to Tellson's was easier than returning from Tellson's.</t4553> <t4554>They kept him at the bank for two hours.</t4554> <t4555>When he returned, without asking the servant anything, he climbed the old stairs alone and just as he was about to enter the Doctor's room, he was stopped by the low sounds coming from inside.</t4555> <t4556>"Good heavens!" he said, startled.</t4556> <t4557>"What is this?" Miss Pross was right beside him with a horrified look on her face.</t4557> <t4558>"Oh, oh! We are ruined!" she was crying out, rubbing her hands.</t4558> <t4559>"What are we going to tell my little bird now?</t4559> <t4560>The man did not recognize me, he is sitting and making shoes!</t4560><t4561>"</t4561>
<t4562>After Mr. Lorry had said everything he could to calm the woman, he entered the Doctor's room alone.</t4562> <t4563>The shoemaking bench was turned towards the light just as he had seen it before, and the man was bent forward, working diligently.</t4563>
<t4564>"Doctor Manette! My dear friend."</t4564> <t4565>"Doctor Manette!"</t4565>
<t4566>The doctor briefly lifted his head and looked at him – with eyes that were half inquisitive, half annoyed at being disturbed – before bending back over the work in front of him.</t4566>
<t4567>He had set aside his jacket and vest; the collar of his shirt was open, just like in the old days when he did this job; his face had once again taken on that pale, wild look.</t4567> <t4568>He was working feverishly –impatiently– as if someone might come and interrupt him.</t4568>
<t4569>When Mr. Lorry looked at the work in the doctor's hand, he saw that it was something of old style and measures.</t4569> <t4570>He took the other shoe standing next to the man and asked what it was.</t4570>
<t4571>Without lifting his head from his work, the doctor murmured, "Walking shoes for a young girl."</t4571> <t4572>"It should have been finished already.</t4572> <t4573>But anyway.</t4573><t4574>"</t4574>
<t4575>"But Doctor Manette.</t4575> <t4576>Look at me, please!</t4576><t4577>"</t4577>
<t4578>The doctor, with his old mechanical obedient manner, complied without interrupting his work.</t4578>
<t4579>"Do you remember me, dear friend?</t4579> <t4580>Please think.</t4580> <t4581>This is not your real job.</t4581> <t4582>Dear friend, please think again!</t4582><t4583>"</t4583>
<t4584>Nothing could make him talk any more.</t4584> <t4585>When asked, he would lift his head and look for a moment; but no matter how much effort was made to persuade him, not a single word would come out of his mouth.</t4585> <t4586>The Doctor worked silently and incessantly, and the words rained down on him as if they had fallen on a wall or into the air without an echo.</t4586> <t4587>The only glimmer of hope Mr. Lorry could see was the Doctor occasionally, even though he was not asked to, secretly lifting his head and looking.</t4587> <t4588>In such moments, there was a faint expression of curiosity and bewilderment on his face; as if his mind was occupied with doubts he was trying to dispel.</t4588>
<t4589>Suddenly, two things came to Mr. Lorry's mind, more important than anything else; first, this incident must be kept from Lucie; second, this incident must be kept from everyone who knew the Doctor.</t4589> <t4590>By putting their heads together, Miss Pross and Mr. Lorry took an urgent measure against the second group by saying that the Doctor was not feeling well and needed to rest for a few days.</t4590> <t4591>As for the deception to be applied to his daughter, Miss Pross would write a letter to Lucie explaining that her father had been called away for work, and even a few imaginary lines supposedly written hastily by her father would be included in the same post.</t4591>
<t4592>Mr. Lorry had taken these sensible measures in the hope that the Doctor would come to his senses.</t4592> <t4593>If this happened soon, there was another plan in place; Mr. Lorry thought this would be the best for the Doctor.</t4593>
<t4594>With hopes for the Doctor's recovery and eagerness to implement his third plan in the village, Mr. Lorry decided not to take his eyes off him; while doing so, he needed to remain inconspicuous.</t4594> <t4595>Therefore, for the first time in his life, he took leave from Tellson's and positioned himself in the same room as the Doctor, in front of the window.</t4595>
<t4596>It didn't take long for Mr. Lorry to realize that talking to the Doctor was of no use, and in fact, made the situation worse, because the more he was pressed, the more anxious the Doctor became.</t4596> <t4597>Mr. Lorry gave up on this attempt on the very first day and decided to keep his distance from him, as if silently protesting, in order to save him from the delusion he had fallen into or was falling into.</t4597> <t4598>Thus, Mr. Lorry spent the whole day sitting in the chair by the window, reading books, writing and drawing, and trying to show him in every pleasant and natural way he could think of that this was a free place.</t4598>
<t4599>Dr. Manette ate and drank what was given to him, and on that first day, he worked until he could no longer see – Mr. Lorry, despite his efforts, had stopped reading and writing half an hour earlier because he could no longer see.</t4599> <t4600>When the doctor set aside his tools to resume in the morning, Mr. Lorry stood up and said:</t4600>
<t4601>"Shall we go outside?</t4601><t4602>"</t4602>
<t4603>The doctor looked down to the ground and to his sides with his usual demeanor, then he raised his head with his usual demeanor and finally repeated in his usual low voice:</t4603>
<t4604>"Outside?</t4604><t4605>'</t4605>
<t4606>"Yes, let's go for a walk together.</t4606> <t4607>Shall we?"</t4607>
<t4608>The doctor made no effort to respond and did not say another word.</t4608> <t4609>But Mr. Lorry, while the Doctor was leaning over his workbench in the evening darkness with his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands, thought he heard him faintly ask himself, "Is it possible?"</t4609> <t4610>The businessman’s common sense had derived something useful from this and did not want to overlook it.</t4610>
<t4611>Miss Pross and Mr. Lorry, dividing the night into shifts, periodically checked on the Doctor from the adjacent room.</t4611> <t4612>Before going to bed, the Doctor paced up and down the room for a long time, and as soon as he finally laid his head on the pillow, he fell asleep immediately.</t4612> <t4613>In the morning, he got up without delay and started working at his bench.</t4613>
<t4614>On the second day, Mr. Lorry cheerfully greeted the Doctor and talked about the topics they had become familiar with recently.</t4614> <t4615>He always spoke of these subjects.</t4615> <t4616>Even though he did not respond, it was clear that the Doctor heard what was being said and, no matter how complex, pondered over them.</t4616> <t4617>This situation encouraged Mr. Lorry to involve Miss Pross at certain times of the day; during such times, the two of them would put their heads together and talk quietly about Lucie, her father, and the day's affairs as if nothing was amiss, with their usual demeanor.</t4617> <t4618>During this time, they did not act overly exaggerated, did not prolong the conversation, nor did they speak so frequently as to disturb the Doctor; the fact that the Doctor began to lift his head more often and seemed affected by the inconsistencies around him somewhat eased Mr. Lorry's warm heart.</t4618>
<t4619>When darkness fell again, Mr. Lorry asked the Doctor as before:</t4619>
<t4620>"Dear Doctor, shall we go outside?</t4620><t4621>"</t4621>
<t4622>The doctor repeated as before; "Outside?"</t4622><t4623>"</t4623>
<t4624>"Yes, let's go for a walk together.</t4624> <t4625>Shall we?"</t4625>
<t4626>When Mr. Lorry received no response from him, he pretended to leave and disappeared for an hour before returning.</t4626> <t4627>During this time, the Doctor had moved to the window and was sitting, looking at the sycamore tree; but with Mr. Lorry's return, he immediately went back to his workbench.</t4627>
<t4628>Time was flowing very slowly and Mr. Lorry's hopes had faded, his heart had become heavy again, and with each passing day it grew heavier and heavier.</t4628> <t4629>The third day came and went, then the fourth, and then the fifth day.</t4629> <t4630>Five days, six days, seven days, eight days, and nine days.</t4630>
<t4631>With his hopes gradually fading and his heart growing heavier with each passing day, Mr. Lorry went through difficult times.</t4631> <t4632>The secret was well kept and Lucie was unaware and happy; but Mr. Lorry couldn't help but notice that the shoemaker's hands, which were slow at first, were becoming more skilled, never working with such enthusiasm before, and never moving as deftly and skillfully as they did in the twilight of this ninth day.</t4632>
<t4633>Nineteen</t4633>
<t4634>An Idea</t4634>
<t4635>Mr. Lorry, exhausted from anxious watching, had fallen asleep at his post.</t4635> <t4636>On the tenth morning of this uncertain situation, Mr. Lorry woke up with a start as daylight streamed in; he must have fallen asleep under the weight that had settled on him in the pitch darkness of the night.</t4636>
<t4637>He rubbed his eyes and shook himself; but even while doing all this, he still wasn't sure if he was awake or not.</t4637> <t4638>Because when he went to the Doctor's room and looked inside, he saw that the cobbler's bench and tools had been put aside again and the Doctor was reading a book in front of the window.</t4638> <t4639>He was wearing his usual morning attire, and although his face (as Mr. Lorry could clearly see) was still pale, it was adorned with a calm interest and attention.</t4639>
<t4640>Although Mr. Lorry convinced himself that he was now awake, in his dazed state, he couldn't decide for a moment whether this recent shoemaking matter was a bothersome illusion created in his mind; after all, his friend was sitting right in front of him in his usual attire and appearance, engaged in his usual occupation, showing not the slightest sign of any change or discomfort.</t4640>
<t4641>After the initial mental confusion and astonishment, everything was becoming a bit clearer.</t4641> <t4642>If these events weren't real and didn't have a valid reason, what was Jarvis Lorry doing there?</t4642> <t4643>Why had he fallen asleep on the couch in Dr. Manette's clinic, fully clothed, and why was he pondering these matters in front of the Doctor's bedroom door at this early hour of the morning?</t4643>
<t4644>Within a few minutes, Miss Pross came to him and was whispering something.</t4644> <t4645>If there had still been a shred of doubt left in him, Miss Pross's words would have surely dispelled it; but by that time, Mr. Lorry's mind had cleared, and he had no doubts left.</t4645> <t4646>He suggested waiting until the usual breakfast hour, and then meeting with the Doctor as if nothing had happened.</t4646> <t4647>If the Doctor was in his usual natural state, Mr. Lorry, without letting his guard down, would ask him to give as much advice and wisdom as he could muster amidst all the troubles.</t4647>
<t4648>The plan was carefully executed with Miss Pross, who had entrusted herself to Mr. Lorry's prudence.</t4648> <t4649>Mr. Lorry, who had plenty of time to dress according to his usual routine, took his place at breakfast in his white linen shirt and his usual silk stockings that showed off his well-shaped legs.</t4649> <t4650>The doctor was called to breakfast as usual, and he also attended.</t4650>
<t4651>Mr. Lorry thought that they could only make solid progress if they approached her gently and gradually, and from what they could understand in this way, the Doctor believed that his daughter's wedding had been the day before.</t4651> <t4652>A topic mentioned in passing, but actually brought up intentionally to reveal the current day and month, had made the Doctor think, calculate in his mind, and visibly unsettled him.</t4652> <t4653>On the other hand, he was so composed in every other aspect that Mr. Lorry was determined to find the remedy he sought.</t4653> <t4654>The remedy was the Doctor himself.</t4654>
<t4655>Thus, after breakfast was finished and the table was cleared, when Mr. Lorry and the Doctor were left alone, Mr. Lorry said to his friend in a compassionate voice:</t4655>
<t4656>"My friend Manette, let's keep this between us, but I am eager to get your opinions on a very strange matter that deeply concerns me; I mean, it seems very strange to me, but perhaps it won't seem as strange to you since you are more knowledgeable than I am."</t4656><t4657>"</t4657>
<t4658>Doctor, who glanced at his hands that had changed color due to his recent busyness, seemed annoyed, but he listened to Mr. Lorry attentively.</t4658> <t4659>He had looked at his hands enough a moment ago.</t4659>
<t4660>"Doctor Manette," said Mr. Lorry, touching his friend's arm affectionately, "this is a matter concerning a very close friend of mine.</t4660> <t4661>Please listen very carefully to what I have to say and give me some advice on his behalf –more importantly, for the sake of his daughter– yes, his daughter, my dear friend.</t4661><t4662>"</t4662>
<t4663>"As far as I understand," said the Doctor in a low voice, "this must be a mental shock?</t4663><t4664>"</t4664>
<t4665>"Correct!"</t4665>
<t4666>"Explain clearly," said the Doctor.</t4666> <t4667>"Do not skip any details.</t4667><t4668>"</t4668>
<t4669>Seeing that they understood each other, Mr. Lorry continued speaking.</t4669>
<t4670>"Dear Manette, this is an old and long-standing type of shock and emotions, feelings, eeh –as you said– it affects the mind to a very large and intense extent.</t4670> <t4671>The mind.</t4671> <t4672>This is such a shock that, when it comes, it takes its victim to a completely different realm, how long it stays is unknown, because I think the person cannot understand how much time has passed and there is no other way to understand it.</t4672> <t4673>The patient comes out of this shock state in a way that he himself cannot explain –once he demonstrated this strikingly in front of everyone.</t4673> <t4674>When he comes out of this shock, he completely returns to his old self, that is, he becomes a man who is extremely intelligent, competent in terms of mental functions, physically tremendously active, and constantly in pursuit of refreshing his already vast knowledge.</t4674> <t4675>But unfortunately" –he paused and took a deep breath– "his ailment relapsed.</t4675><t4676>"</t4676>
<t4677>The doctor asked in a low voice, "How long did it last?</t4677><t4678>"</t4678>
<t4679>"Nine days, nine nights.</t4679><t4680>"</t4680>
<t4681>"How did it manifest itself then?</t4681> <t4682>I wonder," meanwhile the Doctor glanced at his hands again, "did he return to an old habit connected to this shock?</t4682><t4683>"</t4683>
<t4684>"That's exactly what happened.</t4684><t4685>"</t4685>
<t4686>"Well, have you ever seen him," he said, speaking slowly and calmly, "engaged in that task before?</t4686><t4687>"</t4687>
<t4688>"I had seen it once.</t4688><t4689>"</t4689>
<t4690>"Well, when the illness recurred, was it in some ways – or in every way – like what you saw?"</t4690><t4691>"</t4691>
<t4692>"I think it was the same in every aspect.</t4692><t4693>"</t4693>
<t4694>"You mentioned your daughter.</t4694> <t4695>Does she know that this condition has recurred?</t4695><t4696>"</t4696>
<t4697>"No.</t4697> <t4698>This situation was hidden from him, and I hope it will always be kept hidden.</t4698> <t4699>Only I know this, and one other trustworthy person.</t4699><t4700>"</t4700>
<t4701>The doctor tightly held Mr. Lorry's hand and murmured, "You are very kind.</t4701> <t4702>This is a very thoughtful gesture!" he said.</t4702> <t4703>Mr. Lorry also held his hand tightly in response, and they remained silent for a while.</t4703>
<t4704>"Now dear Manette," said Mr. Lorry a little later, in his most gentle and compassionate manner, "I am just a businessman and I am not very good at solving such intricate and difficult matters.</t4704> <t4705>I don't have much knowledge; my mind doesn't grasp these things, I am asking you to guide me.</t4705> <t4706>I can't trust anyone else as much as I trust you on this matter.</t4706> <t4707>There is no one in the world whose knowledge I can trust as much as yours on this matter.</t4707> <t4708>Can you tell me how this ailment recurs?</t4708> <t4709>Is there a risk of it happening again?</t4709> <t4710>Can its recurrence be prevented?</t4710> <t4711>If it recurs, how should it be treated?</t4711> <t4712>Why does such a thing happen?</t4712> <t4713>What can I do for my friend?</t4713> <t4714>There is probably no one as eager as I am to help his friend, but if only I knew what to do.</t4714> <t4715>I don't know what to do in such a situation.</t4715> <t4716>If you guide me with your intelligence, knowledge, and experience, I can do something; but without knowing the way, I can't do much.</t4716> <t4717>Please explain to me, help me see the situation more clearly, and guide me so I can help him.</t4717><t4718>"</t4718>
<t4719>After these heartfelt words, Doctor Manette fell into deep thought, and Mr. Lorry did not press him further.</t4719>
<t4720>"If you ask me, my dear friend," said the Doctor, forcing himself to break the silence, "the discomfort you described was not something the patient did not expect.</t4720><t4721>"</t4721>
<t4722>Mr. Lorry dared to ask, "Well, was he afraid of it?"</t4722>
<t4723>"A lot indeed."</t4723> <t4724>The doctor shuddered involuntarily.</t4724>
<t4725>"You cannot know how much of a burden such a concern creates on the patient and how difficult –almost impossible– it is to force oneself to talk about a subject that upsets them so much.</t4725><t4726>"</t4726>
<t4727>"Well, I wonder," said Mr. Lorry, "if, when this happened to him, he could have shared this secret with someone, wouldn't he have felt a bit relieved?"</t4727><t4728>"</t4728>
<t4729>"They were probably comfortable.</t4729> <t4730>But as I said, this is an almost impossible situation.</t4730> <t4731>In fact – in some cases – I think this is quite impossible.</t4731><t4732>"</t4732>
<t4733>After a brief silence, "Well," said Mr. Lorry, gently placing his hand on the Doctor's arm again, "what do you attribute this crisis to?</t4733><t4734>"</t4734>
<t4735>"I think," said Doctor Manette, "this was an extraordinary situation that made him intensely relive the initial cause of this ailment in his mind.</t4735> <t4736>I believe a series of powerful associations that caused him immense suffering formed in his mind.</t4736> <t4737>Perhaps there were fears within him for some time that these associations would be revived – in certain situations – for some reason.</t4737> <t4738>He tried in vain to prepare himself for these; perhaps all this preparation and effort weakened him.</t4738><t4739>"</t4739>
<t4740>"Well, does he remember what he experienced during this illness?" asked Mr. Lorry with a natural hesitation.</t4740>
<t4741>After the doctor sadly glanced around the room, he shook his head from side to side and replied in a low voice, "No, nothing."</t4741><t4742>"</t4742>
<t4743>"Then let's talk a little about the future," said Mr. Lorry.</t4743>
<t4744>"From the future," said the Doctor, gathering his strength again, "I am quite hopeful.</t4744> <t4745>If he got over this last crisis so quickly, one should not lose hope in God.</t4745> <t4746>If he has been crushed under the pressure of a complex event he has been waiting for in fear and uncertainty for a long time, tried to overcome it, and was able to recover after the dark clouds dispersed, the future cannot be worse.</t4746><t4747>"</t4747>
<t4748>"Very good!"</t4748> <t4749>"I am really relieved."</t4749> <t4750>"Thank you very much!" said Mr. Lorry.</t4750>
<t4751>"Thank you very much!" repeated the Doctor, bowing his head respectfully.</t4751>
<t4752>"There are only two more issues," said Mr. Lorry, "for which I need your opinion.</t4752> <t4753>Shall I explain?</t4753><t4754>"</t4754>
<t4755>"You cannot do a greater kindness for your friend than this."</t4755> <t4756>The doctor extended his hand to Mr. Lorry.</t4756>
<t4757>"So, the first issue is this: My friend is inherently extremely hardworking and incredibly energetic; he makes great efforts to increase his knowledge, constantly reads, conducts experiments, and never remains idle.</t4757> <t4758>Could it be that working this much has been too much for him?</t4758><t4759>"</t4759>
<t4760>"I don't think so.</t4760> <t4761>He's already used to keeping his mind occupied with things.</t4761> <t4762>This could be partly his nature, and partly the result of the troubles he's experienced.</t4762> <t4763>As long as he engages with healthy things, the risk of veering into an unhealthy direction decreases.</t4763> <t4764>He might have arrived at this finding through self-observation.</t4764><t4765>"</t4765>
<t4766>"So, you are sure that he didn't push himself too hard?</t4766><t4767>"</t4767>
<t4768>"If you ask me, that's the way it is.</t4768><t4769>"</t4769>
<t4770>"Well, dear Manette, if he overexerts himself now..."</t4770><t4771>"</t4771>
<t4772>"Dear Lorry, I don't think so.</t4772> <t4773>For a while now, there has been a serious problem in his life, and now he needs to be occupied with other things.</t4773><t4774>"</t4774>
<t4775>"I'm sorry, I'm just a bit of a persistent businessman.</t4775> <t4776>If we assume that he overexerts himself, do you think this ailment will reappear?</t4776><t4777>"</t4777>
<t4778>"Madam.</t4778> <t4779>For such a reason," said Doctor Manette, in a confident manner, "I don't believe his ailment will reappear.</t4779> <t4780>In my opinion, the only thing that could trigger a relapse from now on would be a shocking experience.</t4780> <t4781>After all that has happened and following his recovery, I find it very unlikely that this dreadful affliction will seize him again.</t4781> <t4782>I believe that the circumstances which could cause this ailment to recur have now been eliminated.</t4782><t4783>"</t4783>
<t4784>Dr. Manette had spoken with the timidity of a man aware that the slightest thing could upset the delicate structure of the mind; on the other hand, there was also a self-confidence in his demeanor that had developed over time with the sufferings he had endured and the patience he had shown.</t4784> <t4785>This confidence would not be shaken by his friend.</t4785> <t4786>Mr. Lorry felt much more relieved, encouraged by the Doctor's words, and moved on to the second matter.</t4786> <t4787>He sensed that this would be very difficult; but thinking about the conversation he had with Miss Pross on a Sunday morning and what he had seen over the past nine days, he realized he needed to confront this situation.</t4787>
<t4788>"During this temporary ailment that my friend has managed to get through quite well," said Mr. Lorry, clearing his throat, "we can say that he was engaged in blacksmithing, yes, blacksmithing.</t4788> <t4789>To make the situation more concrete, let's say that in his old bad days, he worked in a small blacksmith's forge.</t4789> <t4790>Now, at completely unexpected moments, he thinks he is back in his forge.</t4790> <t4791>Isn't it very painful for him to live through it this way?</t4791><t4792>"</t4792>
<t4793>The doctor raised his hand to his forehead and stomped his foot angrily.</t4793>
<t4794>Mr. Lorry, "He always kept the hearth," he said, looking at his friend with worried eyes.</t4794> <t4795>"Wouldn't it be better for him to get rid of it from the house?</t4795><t4796>"</t4796>
<t4797>The doctor was still tapping his foot nervously, with his hands on his forehead.</t4797>
<t4798>"It seems difficult to give advice," said Mr. Lorry.</t4798> <t4799>"I think that would be a very appropriate decision.</t4799> <t4800>But I guess..." he trailed off, shaking his head from side to side.</t4800>
<t4801>After a disturbing short silence, Doctor Manette turned to Mr. Lorry and said, "Now look," he said, "it is very difficult to fully explain what is going through this poor man's mind.</t4801> <t4802>Once upon a time, he very earnestly wanted to find a job to occupy himself and was very happy when he found it; clearly, this job greatly alleviated his pain at the time; the confusion of his mind was replaced by the confusion of his fingers, and with this change, as he became more skilled, the dexterity of his fingers replaced the skill of self-tormenting; therefore, he never thought of parting with it.</t4802> <t4803>Even now, although your friend is more hopeful and confident than ever, he panics with a feeling similar to that of a lost child, thinking that if one day he feels the need to return to this old occupation and cannot find it.</t4803><t4804>"</t4804>
<t4805>The moment the doctor lifted his head and looked at Mr. Lorry's face, he resembled the person he had described.</t4805>
<t4806>"But –damn!</t4806> <t4807>As a businessman who has been dealing with material things, guineas, shillings, banknotes, and such for years, I may have asked you many questions, but– I am saying, doesn't keeping this object with you all the time keep the idea constantly in your mind?</t4807> <t4808>If dear Manette had thrown this thing away, wouldn't the fear have gone away with it?</t4808> <t4809>In short, doesn't preserving this blacksmith's forge mean the same as surrendering to fears?</t4809><t4810>"</t4810>
<t4811>There was another silence.</t4811>
<t4812>"As you can appreciate," said the Doctor with a trembling voice, "this is a very old friend.</t4812><t4813>"</t4813>
<t4814>Shaking his head from side to side, "If it were me, I wouldn't keep him by my side," said Mr. Lorry; he had gathered his strength upon seeing the Doctor's concern.</t4814> <t4815>"I will advise him to sacrifice this friend.</t4815> <t4816>I only seek your approval for this.</t4816> <t4817>That hearth is of no use to him anymore.</t4817> <t4818>Come on, my dear friend, please give me this authority.</t4818> <t4819>For the sake of your daughter, dear Manette!</t4819><t4820>"</t4820>
<t4821>The doctor was clearly fighting a great battle within himself!</t4821>
<t4822>"Then, for my daughter's sake, let it be done; I find it appropriate.</t4822> <t4823>But I advise against removing it while she is around.</t4823> <t4824>It would be better to get rid of it when she is not here; let her miss her old friend after not seeing it for a while.</t4824><t4825>"</t4825>
<t4826>Mr. Lorry gladly accepted immediately, and the matter was closed.</t4826> <t4827>They spent the day in the countryside, and the Doctor recovered quite a bit.</t4827> <t4828>He was also very well during the following three days, and on the fourteenth day, he set out to join his daughter Lucie and son-in-law.</t4828> <t4829>Mr. Lorry had previously explained to him the precaution they had taken during the Doctor's silent period, and the Doctor had written something to Lucie accordingly, so she suspected nothing.</t4829>
<t4830>The night the doctor left the house, Mr. Lorry, with an axe, saw, chisel, and hammer in hand, accompanied by Miss Pross holding a lantern, went to his friend's room.</t4830> <t4831>There, behind closed doors, while Mr. Lorry, with a mysterious and guilty demeanor, was smashing the shoemaker's bench to pieces, Miss Pross, as if she were an accomplice to a murder – which suited her stern appearance quite well – held the light for him.</t4831> <t4832>Without any delay, the bench (broken into pieces as intended) was burned in the kitchen fire, and all the tools, shoes, and leather pieces were buried in the garden.</t4832> <t4833>As Mr. Lorry and Miss Pross carried out their actions and erased the traces of them, there was such a dreadful sense of destruction and secrecy that both felt and indeed looked like accomplices to a terrible murder.</t4833>
<t4834>XX</t4834>
<t4835>A Request</t4835>
<t4836>When the newlywed couple returned home, the first person to come and congratulate them was Sydney Carton.</t4836> <t4837>When Carton arrived, Lucie and Charles had not been home for long.</t4837> <t4838>There was no improvement in Carton's habits, appearance, or manners; but he had acquired an air of a strong, loyal friend that Charles Darnay had just begun to notice.</t4838>
<t4839>Carton was waiting for an opportunity to pull Darnay to the window and talk to him at a moment when no one would hear.</t4839>
<t4840>"Mr. Darnay," said Carton, "I hope to be friends with you.</t4840><t4841>"</t4841>
<t4842>"Aren't we already like that?</t4842><t4843>"</t4843>
<t4844>"You are kind and gracious enough to say this; but there is no need for courtesy now.</t4844> <t4845>When I said I hoped to be friends, I didn't exactly mean that.</t4845><t4846>"</t4846>
<t4847>Charles Darnay –as usual– asked with a cheerful and affectionate manner what she meant.</t4847>
<t4848>"Throughout my life," said Carton, smiling, "I have struggled to express what was on my mind.</t4848> <t4849>But if you allow me, I will try to explain.</t4849> <t4850>You remember that infamous evening when I was more drunk than ever, don't you?</t4850><t4851>"</t4851>
<t4852>"I remember that famous evening when you forced me to say that you drank too much.</t4852><t4853>"</t4853>
<t4854>"I remember too.</t4854> <t4855>The curse of such nights weighs heavily on me, and I always remember.</t4855> <t4856>I hope they take this into account when I reach the end of my life!</t4856> <t4857>Don't worry; I won't bore you.</t4857><t4858>"</t4858>
<t4859>"I definitely did not panic.</t4859> <t4860>The only thing that makes me anxious is your sincerity.</t4860><t4861>"</t4861>
<t4862>"Ah!" said Carton, waving his hand indifferently as if dismissing the matter.</t4862> <t4863>"When it comes to talking about whether I love you in my drunken state (as you know, there are plenty of examples like this), I was unbearable.</t4863> <t4864>I hope you can forget it.</t4864><t4865>"</t4865>
<t4866>"I already forgot."</t4866><t4867>"</t4867>
<t4868>"How dare you speak like this!</t4868> <t4869>But Mr. Darnay, I cannot forget some things as easily as you do.</t4869> <t4870>I can never forget my state that evening, and even your dismissive response does not help me forget it.</t4870><t4871>'</t4871>
<t4872>"If I made you think that I took this lightly," replied Darnay, "please forgive me.</t4872> <t4873>My only intention was to set aside a small matter that has caused you surprising distress.</t4873> <t4874>I swear on my honor that this incident had long been erased from my mind.</t4874> <t4875>Though, what was there to erase anyway!</t4875> <t4876>If I have anything to remember, it should be the great kindness you showed me that day.</t4876><t4877>"</t4877>
<t4878>"When you mention great kindness now," said Carton, "I must confess that they were all professional tall tales.</t4878> <t4879>At that time, I didn't really care what would happen to you.</t4879> <t4880>–But look, I am saying at that time; I mean, I am talking about the past.</t4880><t4881>"</t4881>
<t4882>"Now you are underestimating my debt of gratitude to you," said Darnay, "but I will not argue about your underestimation of this situation."</t4882><t4883>"</t4883>
<t4884>"This is the truth, Mr. Darnay, believe me!</t4884> <t4885>Look, I have strayed away from the main topic I wanted to tell you; I was talking about being friends with you.</t4885> <t4886>Now, you know me; you know that I can't soar high like other men.</t4886> <t4887>If you have any doubts about this, ask Stryver, he will tell you.</t4887><t4888>"</t4888>
<t4889>"I prefer to give my opinion on this matter without his help."</t4889><t4890>"</t4890>
<t4891>"Good! In the end, you know me as a worthless person who is good for nothing and will never be."</t4891><t4892>"</t4892>
<t4893>"Will it never be useful, or not, I don't know."</t4893><t4894>"</t4894>
<t4895>"But I know, and you should believe me.</t4895> <t4896>Well, if you are going to accept a worthless, ill-reputed man like me into your home at odd times, at least allow me to come and go as a privileged man; see me as a useless piece of furniture with no special features if you want (of course, I must add that this has nothing to do with the similarity between you and me); like an old item kept for the sake of old times, which has been discarded.</t4896> <t4897>If you grant me this permission, I don't think I would misuse it.</t4897> <t4898>I would probably only visit four or five times a year anyway.</t4898> <t4899>But knowing that I have such a right would make me feel good.</t4899><t4900>"</t4900>
<t4901>"Would you really do this?</t4901><t4902>"</t4902>
<t4903>"From what you say, I infer that I have a place here.</t4903> <t4904>Thank you, Darnay.</t4904> <t4905>Well, may I address you by your name while exercising this right?</t4905><t4906>"</t4906>
<t4907>"Of course, Carton, as you wish."</t4907><t4908>"</t4908>
<t4909>Upon this, they shook hands and Sydney left.</t4909> <t4910>A few minutes had passed when he once again adopted that indifferent attitude towards the outside world.</t4910>
<t4911>After Carton left, Charles Darnay was sitting and talking with Miss Pross, the Doctor, and Mr. Lorry in the evening. He mentioned, in general terms, the conversation he had with Sydney Carton and noted that Sydney Carton's problem was not caring about or valuing anything.</t4911> <t4912>There was no hostile or accusatory tone when he spoke about him; it was as if he was merely conveying something that anyone who looked at him could see.</t4912>
<t4913>He had never thought that these words would occupy his beautiful wife's mind; but later, when he went to their room to be with his wife, he found her waiting for him with her forehead distinctly tensed as before.</t4913>
<t4914>"We seem to be a bit pensive tonight!" said Darnay, embracing his wife with his arms.</t4914>
<t4915>With her hands on her husband's chest, "Yes, dear Charles," said Lucie, her eyes fixed on her husband with a questioning and attentive expression; "we are quite thoughtful tonight, because we have some things on our minds tonight.</t4915><t4916>"</t4916>
<t4917>"What are they, my dear Lucie?"</t4917><t4918>"</t4918>
<t4919>"I will tell you, but please promise me that you won't ask me anything about this, okay?</t4919><t4920>"</t4920>
<t4921>"Should I give my word?</t4921> <t4922>If my beloved asks, how could I not give my word?</t4922><t4923>"</t4923>
<t4924>How could it be thought otherwise, with one hand on his heart that beat for her, while his golden hair, falling over his wife's cheek, was brushed aside with the other!</t4924>
<t4925>"Charles, I think Mr. Carton deserves more attention and respect than what you said about him tonight."</t4925><t4926>"</t4926>
<t4927>"What did I say?"</t4927> <t4928>"Why then?"</t4928><t4929>"</t4929>
<t4930>"Please don't ask me this!</t4930> <t4931>But I think – I know – they deserve this.</t4931><t4932>"</t4932>
<t4933>"If you know, that's enough for me!</t4933> <t4934>So, what do you want me to do, my dear?</t4934><t4935>"</t4935>
<t4936>"My love, I will always ask you to treat him very well and to be tolerant of his mistakes.</t4936> <t4937>Believe me, he has a deeply wounded heart and he very rarely opens it to people.</t4937> <t4938>I have witnessed that heart bleeding, my love.</t4938><t4939>"</t4939>
<t4940>"If I have behaved rudely," said Charles, in a bewildered state, "I am very sorry for that.</t4940> <t4941>I had never thought of it that way for him.</t4941><t4942>"</t4942>
<t4943>"But this is the situation, my dear husband.</t4943> <t4944>I don't think he will ever recover; I have no hope that either his personality or his fate will improve anymore.</t4944> <t4945>But I am sure he can do good things, beautiful things, even noble things.</t4945><t4946>"</t4946>
<t4947>Lucie looked so beautiful with the purity of her faith in this lost man that her husband could gaze at this face for hours.</t4947>
<t4948>Snuggling up to her husband, resting her head on his chest, and fixing her eyes on his, Lucie continued, "And there's this, my love! Don't forget that we draw strength from our happiness, while he becomes even weaker from the pain he endures!</t4948><t4949>"</t4949>
<t4950>Charles was deeply affected by his wife's request.</t4950> <t4951>"I will never forget this, my dear!</t4951> <t4952>I will remember it for the rest of my life.</t4952><t4953>"</t4953>
<t4954>Charles leaned in towards her golden hair and planted a kiss on her rose lips, then hugged her tightly.</t4954> <t4955>If the wretched vagabond wandering the dark streets had seen her innocent words and the merciful tears flowing from her soft, loving blue eyes being wiped away by her husband's kisses, he would have cried all night – and once again these words would have escaped his lips:</t4955>
<t4956>"God, protect that compassionate, beautiful heart!"</t4956>
<t4957>21st</t4957>
<t4958>Echoing Footsteps</t4958>
<t4959>The corner where the Doctor lived was a corner that echoed perfectly.</t4959> <t4960>Lucie sat in the tranquil house in the echoing corner, continuously winding the golden thread that silently and peacefully connected her husband, her father, herself, her old nanny, and her friend into a happy life, listening to the echoing footsteps of the years.</t4960>
<t4961>Although she was an extremely happy young wife at first, there were times when she felt the work slipping away from her and her eyes grew dull.</t4961> <t4962>There was something coming towards her with echoes, something vague, from afar, barely audible, but enough to make her heart race.</t4962> <t4963>Hopes and doubts fluttered inside her – hopes of a love she had not yet known, and doubts that she would not be able to savor this new delight in the remaining days – always constricting her chest.</t4963> <t4964>Amidst the echoing sounds, she could hear the footsteps rising at her grave; then, when she thought of her devastated husband and how he would mourn for her, tears flowed like a flood.</t4964>
<t4965>Time passed and her little daughter Lucie was born.</t4965> <t4966>Then, among these approaching echoes, her daughter's tiny steps and chirping sounds mingled.</t4966> <t4967>Yet, the young mother beside the cradle always heard the approaching great echoes.</t4967> <t4968>As the sounds continued to approach, the dim house was illuminated with the child's laughter, and in the young mother's troubled days, the divine friend of children seemed to have taken her baby into its arms and made her a source of sacred joy.</t4968>
<t4969>The golden thread that tirelessly connected them all was weaving Lucie's happiness into the lives of others, prioritizing it above everything else, so that Lucie heard warm and comforting sounds in the echoes of the years.</t4969> <t4970>Among these, her husband's footsteps were strong and intense; her father's were steady and calm.</t4970> <t4971>As for Miss Pross, she amplified the echoes like an unruly cavalry horse in its harness, snorting through her nose and pawing the ground under the plane tree in the garden when whipped!</t4971>
<t4972>Even in times of sorrowful voices, they were neither hurtful nor rude.</t4972> <t4973>When the weary face of a little boy with golden hair similar to Lucie's was surrounded by a halo of light on the pillow, and with a radiant smile on his face, he said, "Dear mother and father, I am very sad to leave you and my sweet sister; but they are calling me, I must go!" even then, the tears wetting his young mother's cheeks were not tears of pain, but the soul entrusted to her had been taken away.</t4973> <t4974>Feel sorrow for him but do not hinder him.</t4974> <t4975>He will meet God.</t4975> <t4976>God bless him!</t4976>
<t4977>Thus, to the other echoes was added the fluttering of an angel's wings, and these were not earthly echoes, but ones that carried the breath of heaven.</t4977> <t4978>Then the sighs of the winds blowing over the small grave in the garden joined them, and both came to Lucie's ear with a calm murmur, like the breeze of the sea that had fallen asleep on a beach in summer – meanwhile, little Lucie would be eagerly engaging in her morning activities or dressing her doll while chattering away in the language of the Two Cities that had intertwined with her life, at her mother's knee.</t4978>
<t4979>The echoes rarely responded to the footsteps of Sydney Carton.</t4979> <t4980>Carton exercised his right to visit uninvited at most five or six times a year, and as he once frequently did, he would spend the entire evening with them.</t4980> <t4981>He never went there while intoxicated.</t4981> <t4982>There was one more thing whispered about Carton among the echoes, and this had been whispered by all honest echoes for years.</t4982>
<t4983>No man could love a woman this much, and even if he lost her, he couldn't remain so innocently and stubbornly attached to her, knowing that she was now a wife and mother, to the extent that even Lucie's children felt a strange sympathy for Carton – perhaps they pitied him with an instinctive sensitivity.</t4983> <t4984>No echo could tell what secret emotions created this; but it was so, it was very obvious.</t4984> <t4985>The first stranger to whom little Lucie extended her chubby arms was Carton, and he was always by her side as she grew up.</t4985> <t4986>Even the little boy, while taking his last breath, was murmuring his name.</t4986> <t4987>"Poor Carton! Kiss him for me!</t4987><t4988>"</t4988>
<t4989>Mr. Stryver, like a large boat trying to make its way through muddy water, was forging ahead on the path of law, dragging his useful friend in his wake like a dinghy at the stern of the boat.</t4989> <t4990>These privileged dinghies generally encounter difficulties, often bobbing up and down in the water, and thus Sydney was living such a sunken life.</t4990>
<t4991>The indifferent and powerful state within him, even if not pleased, was so much easier and stronger than any kind of unpleasantness and disgrace that Carton could not deviate from the path he was on, and never considered giving up being the jackal to the lion, whereas it was expected that all true jackals would hope to become lions one day.</t4991> <t4992>Stryver, on the other hand, had become wealthy; he had married a vigorous widow with a lot of property and three sons, who had no brilliance other than the straight hair shining on their dull heads.</t4992>
<t4993>Mr. Stryver, in his most unpleasantly domineering manner, herded these three young gentlemen like sheep to the corner in Soho and, after handing them over to Lucie's husband as students, said, "Hello!</t4993> <t4994>Their flesh is yours, their bones are mine. If you want to use these three pieces of flesh while going on a family picnic, Darnay!" The polite refusal of this offer of three pieces of flesh drove Mr. Stryver mad, and he decided to educate the young gentlemen himself. He first advised them to steer clear of the arrogance of Beggars, like this private tutor.</t4994> <t4995>On nights when he drank too much, he would sit across from Mr. Stryver and loudly recount the traps Ms. Darnay had set to "catch" him and the magnificent tactics he had used to avoid being "caught."</t4995> <t4996>His colleagues from the bar who attended these boozy and boastful gatherings would tolerate him, noting that Stryver had begun to believe his own lies – it was such an incorrigible situation that everyone avoided him as much as possible.</t4996>
<t4997>All these were among the echoes that Lucie sometimes listened to thoughtfully, sometimes with cheerful laughter, in her corner until her little girl turned six.</t4997> <t4998>There is no need to mention how the pitter-patter of her child's footsteps, the always lively and confident steps of her father, and the footsteps of her beloved husband warmed her heart.</t4998> <t4999>Moreover, every little echo in their peaceful home, which Lucie managed with great delicacy and thrift, where nothing was wasted, sounded like a beautiful melody to the young woman's ears.</t4999> <t5000>Especially when her father told her that he felt even more connected to her after she got married, and her husband said that none of her attentions and duties diminished her love and support for him, and asked her, "How do you manage to be everything to all of us?</t5000> <t5001>You attend to all our needs but never seem rushed or act as if you have too much to do?" these words sweetly echoed in Lucie's ears.</t5001>
<t5002>But all this time, there were also voices echoing in the distance and rumbling menacingly in the corner.</t5002> <t5003>During these days when little Lucie's birthday was being celebrated, these voices began to emerge terribly, as if a great storm had broken out in France and the seas had risen tremendously.</t5003>
<t5004>One night in mid-July of the year 1789, Mr. Lorry came from Tellson's late and sat down beside Lucie and her husband in front of the dark window.</t5004> <t5005>It was a hot and sultry night, and all three of them remembered that past Sunday night when they had watched the lightning strike in the same place.</t5005>
<t5006>"I suppose," said Mr. Lorry, pushing his brown wig back, "I will have to spend the night at Tellson's.</t5006> <t5007>We had so much work all day that we didn't know where to start or how to do it.</t5007> <t5008>Paris is in a tremendous state of unrest, and all the clients are flocking to us!</t5008> <t5009>Our clients there are bewildered about how to transfer their assets to us.</t5009> <t5010>Some of them are struggling like mad to send them to England.</t5010><t5011>"</t5011>
<t5012>"This is not at all pleasant," said Darnay.</t5012>
<t5013>"Isn't it quite unpleasant, dear Darnay?"</t5013> <t5014>"Yes, but we don't know the reason for it."</t5014> <t5015>"People are acting irrationally!"</t5015> <t5016>"Some of the people at Tellson's have aged like me, so we can't just change the bank's operations for no reason."</t5016><t5017>"</t5017>
<t5018>"That's true," said Darnay, "you can see how gloomy and dark the weather is.</t5018><t5019>"</t5019>
<t5020>"Of course I see," Mr. Lorry immediately conceded, trying to convince himself that he was no longer in his usual calm state and was complaining.</t5020> <t5021>"But after such a terrible and long day, I'm also quite annoyed now.</t5021> <t5022>Where is Manette?"</t5022>
<t5023>At that moment, the Doctor who entered the dark room called out, "I'm here."</t5023>
<t5024>"I am very glad that you are home; because my nerves have been unnecessarily frayed all day by the hustle and premonitions surrounding me.</t5024> <t5025>I hope you are not going out.</t5025><t5026>"</t5026>
<t5027>"No; if you want, we can play backgammon together," said the Doctor.</t5027>
<t5028>"To tell the truth, I don't really want to, I guess.</t5028> <t5029>I don't have the strength to argue with you tonight.</t5029> <t5030>Is the tea tray still here, Lucie? I couldn't see it.</t5030><t5031>"</t5031>
<t5032>"Of course, I waited for you."</t5032><t5033>"</t5033>
<t5034>"Thank you, my dear.</t5034> <t5035>Did the sweet girl go to bed?</t5035><t5036>"</t5036>
<t5037>"Yes, sleeping soundly."</t5037><t5038>"</t5038>
<t5039>"I'm fine, everything is alright!</t5039> <t5040>Although, thank God, everything is always alright here of course; but today my nerves are very frayed, well, I'm not as young as I used to be anymore!</t5040> <t5041>Oh, is that my tea, dear!</t5041> <t5042>Thank you.</t5042> <t5043>Now you come join us too, and let's all sit quietly together and listen to those echoes you've been creating various theories about.</t5043><t5044>"</t5044>
<t5045>"It wasn't actually a theory; just an idea.</t5045><t5046>"</t5046>
<t5047>"Well, let it be a thought then, my clever girl," said Mr. Lorry, gently tapping Lucie's hand with affection.</t5047> <t5048>"How loud and high their voices are, aren't they?</t5048> <t5049>Just listen!</t5049><t5050>"</t5050>
<t5051>As this small community sat in front of a dark window in London, hurried, frantic, and dangerous steps advanced with great determination as if they would destroy anything in their path, and once these steps approaching from beyond St. Antoine were stained with madness and fury, they could not be easily cleansed.</t5051>
<t5052>That morning, St. Antoine was like a vast and dark sea of railings swaying back and forth, and the light of steel swords and bayonets glistening under the sun occasionally struck the tops of the heads moving up and down.</t5052> <t5053>Then a tremendous roar rose from the narrow passage of St. Antoine; a forest of bare arms, like tree branches dried by winter winds, were raised to the sky.</t5053> <t5054>All fingers, no matter how far they had been thrown from, were striving to grab whatever weapon or weapon-like object was hurled at them.</t5054>
<t5055>Who was giving these weapons, where were they coming from, how had everything started, how had all these crooked and trembling weapons, standing like a lightning bolt above the crowd, reached them, there was no one among them who could answer these questions; on the other hand, rifles were being distributed continuously – and of course cartridges, gunpowder, cannonballs, iron rods, clubs, knives, axes, spears, and every kind of weapon imaginable and useful were being passed from hand to hand.</t5055> <t5056>Those who were not closing anything were busy tearing stones and bricks from the walls with bloody hands.</t5056> <t5057>Every heart and pulse in St. Antoine was beating wildly.</t5057> <t5058>Every living being there was disregarding their life, madly eager to sacrifice themselves with ambitious impatience.</t5058>
<t5059>Just as every boiling whirlpool has a center, the center of this frothing crowd was Defarge's wine shop, and every drop boiling in the cauldron was eager to be drawn into the vortex where Defarge was already steeped in gunpowder and sweat, issuing commands, distributing weapons, pushing one person and pulling another, taking a weapon from one and giving it to another, and toiling amidst all this intense chaos.</t5059>
<t5060>"Stand close to me, Jacques Three," shouted Defarge; "and you, Jacques One and Jacques Two, go immediately and take command of as many patriots as you can.</t5060> <t5061>Where is my wife?</t5061><t5062>"</t5062>
<t5063>"Well, here I am!" said the madam with her usual calmness, but today she wasn't knitting.</t5063> <t5064>In the madam's determined right hand, instead of her usual and relatively soft tools, there was an axe, and on her belt, there was a gun and a terrifying knife.</t5064>
<t5065>"Where are you going?"</t5065><t5066>"</t5066>
<t5067>"I will come with you," said the lady, "and later you will see me leading the women."</t5067><t5068>"</t5068>
<t5069>"Then let's go!" shouted Defarge, with his ringing voice.</t5069> <t5070>"Patriots, my friends, we are ready now!</t5070> <t5071>To the Bastille!"</t5071>
<t5072>As if all the breaths in France had uttered this disgusting word, a great noise erupted, and the living sea surged wave upon wave, piling on top of each other and furiously carrying the entire city to that point.</t5072> <t5073>As the bells rang, the drums beat, and the sea swelled with rage, pounding its new shore, the attack began.</t5073>
<t5074>Deep trenches, two suspension bridges, huge stone walls, eight large towers, cannons, rifles, fire, and smoke.</t5074> <t5075>The owner of the wine shop, Defarge, fought bravely like a valiant soldier for two fierce hours amidst all that fire and smoke – the sea had carried him through the fire and smoke to the cannon, and as soon as he took charge, he became an artilleryman.</t5075>
<t5076>A deep trench, a suspension bridge, huge stone walls, eight large towers, cannons, rifles, fire, and smoke.</t5076> <t5077>One of the bridges came down!</t5077> <t5078>"Come on, friends, come on! Come on Jacques One, Jacques Two, Jacques Thousand, Jacques Two Thousand, Jacques Twenty-five Thousand; all Angels and Demons –whichever you choose– come on!" The wine shop owner Defarge never left the side of the cannon that had become quite hot.</t5078>
<t5079>"Come closer, women!" his wife shouted.</t5079> <t5080>"What are you saying?</t5080> <t5081>After the Bastille is taken, can we kill like men too?" Though their hands were filled with various weapons, driven by hunger and revenge, the women, who were the only weapon, screamed with their shrill voices and all their might.</t5081>
<t5082>Cannon, rifle, fire and smoke; but still, there were deep trenches, a solitary suspension bridge, massive stone walls, and eight large towers before them.</t5082> <t5083>Those who were wounded and fell to the ground caused small shifts in the swelling sea.</t5083> <t5084>Exploding weapons, burning torches, carts loaded with wet straw emitting smoke, frantic activity in every direction from nearby trenches, screams, volleys of gunfire, curses, relentless courage, the hum, the clamor, and the angry sound of the living sea; but still, there were deep trenches, a solitary suspension bridge, massive stone walls, eight large towers, and the wine shop owner Defarge still at the cannon, thoroughly enraged after four fierce hours.</t5084>
<t5085>After the white flag was raised at the castle and the negotiations began – but in this furious storm, nothing could be seen or heard properly – the sea suddenly swelled and foamed incredibly, and hurled Defarge over the drawbridge, delivering him among the eight large towers over the massive stone walls!</t5085>
<t5086>The power of the ocean that hurled him there was so irresistible that, until he reached the outer courtyard of the Bastille, it was impossible to breathe or turn his head as if he were struggling with the waves in the South Sea.</t5086> <t5087>When he arrived, he tried to look around at the base of the wall.</t5087> <t5088>Jacques Three was right beside him; Madame Defarge, who still led the women, was within sight with a knife in her hand.</t5088> <t5089>Everywhere there was.</t5089> <t5090>chaos, joy, deafening and mad frenzy, astonishing noise, and despite everything, an angry pantomime.</t5090>
<t5091>"Prisoners!"</t5091>
<t5092>"Records!</t5092><t5093>"</t5093>
<t5094>"Secret cells!</t5094><t5095>"</t5095>
<t5096>"Torture devices!</t5096><t5097>"</t5097>
<t5098>"Prisoners!"</t5098>
<t5099>Amidst all these screams and tens of thousands of contradictions, the most heard scream in the sea that flowed inside like a human flood as infinite as time and space was "Prisoners!"</t5099> <t5100>When the foremost waves dragged the guards in front of them and threatened them with death to ensure that no hidden corner remained unopened, Defarge placed his hand on the chest of one of these men – a gray-haired man holding a torch – and separated him from the others, pinning him between the wall and himself.</t5100>
<t5101>"Show me the North Tower!" said Defarge.</t5101> <t5102>"Quick!</t5102><t5103>"</t5103>
<t5104>"Of course, I'll show you," the man replied, "come with me.</t5104> <t5105>But there's no one there.</t5105><t5106>"</t5106>
<t5107>"What is the meaning of the One Hundred and Five North Tower?" asked Defarge.</t5107> <t5108>"Quickly, tell me!</t5108><t5109>"</t5109>
<t5110>"Did you ask for the meaning, monsieur?</t5110><t5111>"</t5111>
<t5112>"Is this a prisoner or a cell?</t5112> <t5113>Or does it mean I can kill you right here and now?</t5113><t5114>"</t5114>
<t5115>Jacques Three, who approached them, shouted in a hoarse voice, "Kill him!"</t5115>
<t5116>"Monsieur, that is a cell.</t5116><t5117>"</t5117>
<t5118>"Show me that place!"</t5118>
<t5119>"Let's go this way then.</t5119><t5120>"</t5120>
<t5121>With his usual greedy demeanor and disappointed by the dialogue between the man and Defarge progressing towards a point where no blood would be shed, Jacques Three had grabbed Defarge's arm, and Defarge had grabbed the guard's arm.</t5121> <t5122>During this brief conversation.</t5122> <t5123>The three heads were closely huddled together, but even in that state, they could barely hear each other.</t5123> <t5124>As the living ocean invaded the Bastille and surged through its courtyards, corridors, and stairways, it made a tremendous noise.</t5124> <t5125>Outside, the ocean was pounding the walls with a deep, muffled roar, and the screams rising from this chaos were scattering in the air.</t5125>
<t5126>Defarge, the guard, and Jacques Three, arm in arm, hurried along at full speed, passing by the gloomy cellars where daylight had never once entered, and the disgusting doors of dark dungeons, descending steps that resembled caves, and climbing steep slopes of stone and brick that resembled dried-up waterfalls.</t5126> <t5127>In many places, especially in the first places they passed, they too were swept away by the flood, but as their descent ended and they spiraled up the tower, they were left alone.</t5127> <t5128>Now, surrounded by the imposing thick walls and arches, the sound of the storm both inside and outside the castle came very muffled and deep, as if all that noise would destroy their sense of hearing.</t5128>
<t5129>The guard stood in front of a low door, inserted the key into the lock with a clatter, slowly opened the door, and as they all bowed their heads and entered, he said:</t5129>
<t5130>"Here is One Hundred and Five, North Tower!"</t5130>
<t5131>On top of the wall, there was a small window with thick iron bars and no glass, with a stone partition in front of it, so one had to crouch down to the ground and look up to see the sky.</t5131> <t5132>A little further away, there was a small chimney covered with thick grates.</t5132> <t5133>Inside, there was a stool, a table, and a straw bed.</t5133> <t5134>All four walls were pitch black, and on one of them, a ring was hanging.</t5134>
<t5135>"Hold the torch up to these walls so I can see," Defarge said to the guard.</t5135>
<t5136>Adam followed what was said.</t5136> <t5137>Defarge also carefully followed the light with his eyes.</t5137>
<t5138>"Stop! – Look over there, Jacques!"</t5138>
<t5139>As Jacques was reading with a greedy attitude, he shouted in a muffled voice, "A.</t5139> <t5140>M!"</t5140>
<t5141>Defarge, running his dark finger stained with gunpowder over the letters, said into his friend's ear, "Alexandre Manette."</t5141> <t5142>"Look, he also wrote 'A poor doctor' here."</t5142><t5143>"</t5143> <t5144>He was definitely the one who drew the calendar on this stone.</t5144> <t5145>What is that in your hand? A shackle?</t5145> <t5146>Give it to me!</t5146><t5147>"</t5147>
<t5148>Defarge still had the rifle in his hand.</t5148> <t5149>He quickly handed it to Jacques, took the crowbar, and shattered the worm-eaten stool and table with a few blows.</t5149>
<t5150>Defarge said angrily to the guard, "Hold the light a little higher!"</t5150> <t5151>"Look carefully between those pieces, Jacques! Take my knife," he said, throwing it to him; "tear open the bed, look inside the straw.</t5151> <t5152>You, lift that light a little higher too!</t5152><t5153>"</t5153>
<t5154>After looking at the guard menacingly, he bent over the stove and looked up the chimney, then struck its edges with the iron poker in his hand and tried to remove the iron grate on top.</t5154> <t5155>A few minutes later, when plaster and dust started falling from above, he turned his head to the side; amidst all this dust and old ashes, he cautiously felt around with his weapon inside a crack in the chimney.</t5155>
<t5156>"Isn't there something in the ashes or the straw, Jacques?</t5156><t5157>"</t5157>
<t5158>"Nothing.</t5158><t5159>"</t5159>
<t5160>"Let's gather these in the middle of the cell.</t5160> <t5161>Now, burn them!" .</t5161>
<t5162>With the guard's ignition, the small pile burned brightly.</t5162> <t5163>Leaving the fire burning, they bent down again and exited through the low-arched door, following the path to the courtyard; as they descended, their sense of hearing improved; until they found themselves once again in the midst of the angry human flood.</t5163>
<t5164>People were running around excitedly, looking for Defarge.</t5164> <t5165>St. Antoine was clamoring to unleash the wine shop owner upon the governor who defended the Bastille and fired upon the people.</t5165> <t5166>Otherwise, the governor would not be taken to the Town Hall for trial.</t5166> <t5167>Otherwise, the governor would escape, and the blood of the people (which had suddenly become valuable after years of being worthless) would be left unavenged.</t5167>
<t5168>With his eye-catching gray jacket and red insignia, surrounded by the crowd groaning with passion and ambition, there was only one person who remained calm among them, and that was a woman.</t5168> <t5169>"Here comes my husband!" she shouted, pointing at Defarge.</t5169> <t5170>"Look at Defarge!" The woman stood motionless right next to the stern-faced old official, even as Defarge and the rest of the crowd dragged the man through the streets, pushed him from behind as they approached their intended spot, and as knives and fists rained down on the man, the woman remained motionless, always close to the man, and when the man finally collapsed lifelessly to the ground, she was right beside him and suddenly moved, placing her foot on the man's neck and with the cruel knife she had been holding for a long time, severed the man's head from his body.</t5170>
<t5171>It was time to implement the horrific idea of hanging people instead of lamps, to show what St. Antoine was and what he could do.</t5171> <t5172>Blood had rushed to St. Antoine's head, and the blood of iron-handed tyranny and domination had been spilled – it was flowing down from the steps of the Town Hall, from where the governor's body lay – and from the sole of Madam Defarge's shoe, which she had planted on the man's body to behead him.</t5172> <t5173>After looking around to see if there were any other men to kill, St. Antoine shouted, "Lower the lamp over here! Let's put one of his soldiers on guard!" As the guard swung from the lamp post, the sea surged again.</t5173>
<t5174>The depth of this terrifying dark water and the destructive waves crashing over each other is beyond comprehension, and its power is unknown.</t5174> <t5175>The merciless sea, with all its cruelty, was tossing bodies, voices of revenge, and faces hardened by pain, devoid of any trace of mercy.</t5175>
<t5176>But within this torrent of people filled with furious and angry expressions, there were two groups of seven people each who, unlike the others, were in a more devastated state than anyone else swept away by this crowd.</t5176> <t5177>The seven prisoners, suddenly freed by the storm that scattered their graves, were now being carried on hands; all of them were frightened, as if they had fallen into a void, bewildered by what had happened to them, as if Judgment Day had come and the people surrounding them were lost souls.</t5177> <t5178>The other seven faces being carried a little higher up were lifeless, their eyelids drooped, their eyes half-open, waiting for Judgment Day.</t5178> <t5179>These were indifferent faces, yet they bore an expression that was postponed but never altered; after a fearful wait, their drooped eyelids would open with effort and those lifeless lips would testify, "YOU DID THIS!"</t5179>
<t5180>The seven released prisoners, the seven bloody heads on the tips of spears, the keys to the cursed castle with its eight sturdy towers, some letters and belongings left by former prisoners, the broken hearts that died years ago –and a lot of similar things–</t5180> <t5181>walked through the streets of Paris in mid-July of the year 1789, accompanied by the thunderous footsteps of St. Antoine.</t5181> <t5182>May Lucie Darnay's predictions not come true, and may these distant footsteps remain far from them!</t5182> <t5183>The crowd sees nothing because they are like madmen, dangerous, and it is not at all easy to clean the streets stained red again years after the wine barrel broke in front of Defarge's shop.</t5183>
<t5184>XXII</t5184>
<t5185>The Sea is Still Rising</t5185>
<t5186>Madam Defarge was sitting behind her counter as usual, scrutinizing the customers, while the weary St. Antoine was so joyful from a week of embracing and congratulating each other like brothers that he could soften the little bread he had.</t5186> <t5187>There was no rose in Madam Defarge's hair, because even in that short week, the spies were strangely cautious about leaving themselves to the mercy of the saints.</t5187> <t5188>The street lamps were swinging ominously.</t5188>
<t5189>Madame Defarge, with her arms crossed, was thoughtfully looking at the wine shop and the road under the morning sun.</t5189> <t5190>On both, there were groups of idle people in filthy and miserable conditions, but now a clear power seemed to have settled over all their troubles.</t5190> <t5191>From the most wretched nightcap, worn on the most miserable head, this could be read: "I, who wear this cap, know how hard it is to sustain my life, but do you know how easy it is for me, who wears this cap, to take your life?"</t5191> <t5192>Every skinny and bare arm that previously had no work was now ready to do this at any moment.</t5192> <t5193>The fingers of the women knitting were in a terrible state from the experiences they had lived through before.</t5193> <t5194>The face of St. Antoine had changed; this image had been ingrained in it for centuries, and with the final strong blow, its expression had changed completely.</t5194>
<t5195>Madame Defarge was sitting, watching her surroundings with the secret satisfaction expected from the leader of the women of St Antoine.</t5195> <t5196>One of her friends was also knitting beside her.</t5196> <t5197>This short, plump woman, who was the wife of a skin-and-bones grocer and mother of two children, was named Vengeance because she was Madame Defarge's right hand.</t5197>
<t5198>"Listen!" said Revenge.</t5198> <t5199>"Listen, look! Who is coming?</t5199><t5200>"</t5200>
<t5201>A series of gunpowder-like, powerful hums spread from the borders of the St. Antoine district towards the door of the wine shop, as if ignited.</t5201>
<t5202>"Here is Defarge," said madam.</t5202> <t5203>"Silence, friends!" Defarge arrived out of breath, took off the red cap on his head, and looked around!</t5203> <t5204>"Everyone be quiet!" said madam again.</t5204> <t5205>"Listen to him!" Defarge was standing breathlessly in front of the eager eyes and open mouths gathered at the door; everyone in the wine shop had jumped to their feet.</t5205>
<t5206>"Tell me, my dear husband.</t5206> <t5207>What happened?</t5207><t5208>"</t5208>
<t5209>"There is news from the other world!</t5209><t5210>"</t5210>
<t5211>"What do you mean?" shouted the madam, with a disdainful tone.</t5211> <t5212>"The other world?</t5212><t5213>"</t5213>
<t5214>"Does everyone here remember old Foulon, who suggested that starving people eat grass and then went on to meet his end in hell?"</t5214><t5215>"</t5215>
<t5216>They all shouted together, "We remember."</t5216>
<t5217>"The news is about him.</t5217> <t5218>He is among us!"</t5218>
<t5219>"Is he among us?" they shouted all together again.</t5219> <t5220>"Wasn't he dead?</t5220><t5221>"</t5221>
<t5222>"He didn't die! He was so scared of us –and not without reason– that he spread the news of his death and arranged a grand funeral for himself.</t5222> <t5223>But they found him hiding in a rural area and brought him back.</t5223> <t5224>I had seen him, but now he is being taken to the City Hall as a prisoner.</t5224> <t5225>I said he was right to be afraid of us.</t5225> <t5226>Tell me!</t5226> <t5227>Is he right or not?</t5227><t5228>"</t5228>
<t5229>If this miserable sinner, who had reached the age of seventy, had heard these cries, even if he had not yet found the answer, he would certainly have felt it deep in his heart.</t5229>
<t5230>Then there was a silence that penetrated deep into the soul.</t5230> <t5231>Defarge and his wife looked at each other resolutely.</t5231> <t5232>Revenge was leaning behind the counter, moving the drum at his feet.</t5232>
<t5233>"Comrades!" cried Defarge in a determined voice.</t5233> <t5234>"Are we ready?</t5234><t5235>"</t5235>
<t5236>Madame Defarge immediately tucked her knife into her belt; the drum was thundering in the streets, as if the drummer and his drum had magically vanished, and Vengeance, with terrifying screams and her arms raised like the Furies, was going door to door rousing the women.</t5236>
<t5237>Men were terrifying as they looked out from the windows with their cruel rage, armed with whatever weapons they could find, mingling with the flood of people in the streets, but the state of the women was enough to freeze the blood of even the bravest person.</t5237><t5238>Leaving behind all the work in their barely subsisting homes, their children, their elderly, and their starving, ailing loved ones who were languishing in desolate places, they threw themselves into the streets with their hair flowing, inciting both each other and themselves with wild screams and behaviors.</t5238><t5239>Foulon the murderer has been caught, my brother!</t5239><t5240>Foulon the murderer has been caught, my mother!</t5240><t5241>Foulon the tyrant has been caught, my daughter!</t5241><t5242>Then a group joined them, beating their chests, tearing their hair, and shouting, Foulon is alive!</t5242><t5243>Foulon, who told the starving people to eat grass!</t5243><t5244>Foulon, who told my old father, to whom I couldn't give a piece of bread, to eat grass!</t5244><t5245>Foulon, who told the baby that couldn't suckle from its mother's dry breast to suck on grass!</t5245><t5246>Oh, this Foulon! My God, what pains we have suffered!</t5246><t5247>Hear me, my dead baby and my withering father!</t5247><t5248>I swear on this stone and soil that I will take revenge on Foulon for you!</t5248><t5249>Husbands, brothers, and young men, bring us Foulon's blood! Bring us Foulon's head! Bring us Foulon's heart, bring us Foulon's body and soul, tear Foulon apart and bury him so that grass grows on him!</t5249><t5250>A multitude of women, screaming like mad, attacked everything around them, whirling about, hitting their friends and tearing their clothes until they fainted from rage, and only their men could save them from being trampled underfoot.</t5250>
<t5251>Still, no time had been wasted!</t5251> <t5252>This man called Foulon was at the City Hall and could be released.</t5252> <t5253>However, St Antoine, who had suffered so much pain, insult, and injustice, would never allow this!</t5253> <t5254>Armed men and women swiftly left the neighborhood in droves, and they pulled the remaining stragglers towards them with such force that within fifteen minutes, there was no one left in the heart of St Antoine except for a few old women and wailing children.</t5254>
<t5255>No one.</t5255> <t5256>At that moment, they had all crowded into the interrogation room where this old, ugly, and treacherous man was, and they had even spilled into the adjacent courtyard and streets.</t5256> <t5257>The Defarges, husband and wife, Revenge, and Jacques Three were always at the forefront, and in the room, they were standing just a little away from Foulon.</t5257>
<t5258>Pointing with her knife, "Look at that!" shouted the madam.</t5258> <t5259>"Look, they've tied up the old man with ropes.</t5259> <t5260>It's a good idea to tie a bunch of grass to his back.</t5260> <t5261>Ha ha! They had a very clever idea.</t5261> <t5262>Now let him eat it!"</t5262> <t5263>The madam had tucked her knife under her arm and was clapping her hands as if she were in a play.</t5263>
<t5264>The people standing right behind Madam Defarge explained to those behind them why the woman was so delighted, then they explained to those behind them, and they to those behind them, until all the surrounding streets echoed with applause.</t5264> <t5265>Thus, during the two to three hours of interrogation and while the words spilled from the man's mouth were being sifted, even the people far away were instantly informed of every expression that appeared on Madam Defarge's impatient face.</t5265> <t5266>One reason for this rapid dissemination was that some agile men who knew Madam Defarge well climbed the building from the outside to look in through the window and acted as telegraphs between the madam and the crowd outside.</t5266>
<t5267>After a while, the sun rose higher as if to give hope or to protect, and its soft light fell directly on the old prisoner.</t5267> <t5268>This was too much; in the blink of an eye, that long barrier of straw dust mingled with the wind and St. Antoine seized the man!</t5268>
<t5269>Even those at the very back of the crowd were instantly informed of the situation.</t5269> <t5270>Defarge leaped over the railing and the table that stood between him and the man, and pounced on the lowly scoundrel – Madame Defarge followed her husband and grabbed one of the ropes the man was tied with –</t5270> <t5271>Revenge and Jacques Three did not follow them, and the men perched at the windows like birds did not rush into the hall yet; then from outside came the cries, "Bring him out!</t5271> <t5272>Bring him to the lamp!"</t5272>
<t5273>They dragged the man down the stairs of the building; sometimes on his knees, sometimes standing, sometimes pulling him on his back, they pushed him, and when hundreds of hands pressed grass and straw into his face, he felt like he was suffocating; his clothes were torn, he was covered in wounds and bruises, he was struggling to breathe, and he was bleeding all over; yet he did not stop begging and pleading for mercy; during this passionate and painful act, people made space by pulling each other back to see him; he was like a dry log in a forest of hundreds of legs; they dragged the man to the nearest corner where one of the deadly lamps was hanging; Madam here –like a cat releasing a mouse– let him go and watched him with a calm demeanor while the crowd made their preparations, and he begged and pleaded with Madam.</t5273> <t5274>Meanwhile, the women were constantly screaming shrilly, and the men were shouting that they would kill him by stuffing his mouth harshly.</t5274> <t5275>At one point, they pulled the man up, but the rope broke and they caught him as he fell to the ground screaming; then they pulled him up again, the rope broke again, and they caught him again as he fell screaming; finally, the rope held him painfully, and soon his head, with enough grass in his mouth to make all of St. Antoine dance before him, was on the end of a stake.</t5275>
<t5276>But the day's bad deeds were not yet over, for when the wretched man's despicable son-in-law, another enemy of the people, arrived in Paris with five hundred soldiers, St. Antoine screamed and went so berserk that the place was in turmoil again.</t5276> <t5277>St. Antoine had written his crimes on gilded papers, they caught him quickly –they could have dragged him out of the heart of an army to accompany Foulon– they impaled his head and heart on stakes and paraded through the streets with the day's three trophies in hand.</t5277>
<t5278>When the women and men returned to their whining hungry children, it was already quite dark.</t5278> <t5279>Then long queues formed in front of the wretched bakeries, and people waited patiently to get dry bread; while waiting with empty and growling stomachs, they spent their time embracing each other in a drunkenness of victory and gossiping.</t5279> <t5280>Gradually, the queues of people in tattered clothes shortened and disappeared, and dim lights began to flicker one by one in the high windows; small fires were also lit in the streets, and neighbors cooked their meals together on these fires and then ate them in front of their doors.</t5280>
<t5281>The only accompaniment to these meager and inadequate meals, which contained no trace of meat, was dry bread.</t5281> <t5282>On the other hand, these poor foods, enriched by friendship, had awakened a sense of joy within people.</t5282> <t5283>Parents, who had taken their share of this bad day, played sweetly with their skinny children; lovers, on the other hand, filled with love and hope as they looked at their surroundings and the life stretching out before them.</t5283>
<t5284>When the last customers at Defarge's wine shop had left, it was almost dawn, and as Monsieur Defarge was locking the door, he whispered softly to Madame:</t5284>
<t5285>"The day we've been waiting for has finally come, my dear wife!" he said.</t5285>
<t5286>"Eh!" replied the madam.</t5286> <t5287>"Almost.</t5287><t5288>"</t5288>
<t5289>St. Antoine fell asleep, the Defarges fell asleep.</t5289> <t5290>Revenge also fell asleep with her husband writhing in hunger, and the drum took a rest.</t5290> <t5291>In St. Antoine, the only sound that blood and turmoil couldn't change was the drum's.</t5291> <t5292>If she wanted, Revenge, who preserved it, could wake it up and make it produce the sounds from before the fall of the Bastille or before old Foulon was captured; but the same couldn't be said for the low-voiced people in the heart of St. Antoine.</t5292>
<t5293>XXIII</t5293>
<t5294>Tension is Rising</t5294>
<t5295>There was a change in the village where the fountain flowed, and the road worker eked out his living from the stones on the roads for the sake of carrying and holding together his poor ignorant soul and his poor skinny body.</t5295> <t5296>The prison on top of the rocks was not as popular as it used to be; there were soldiers guarding it now, but they were few in number, and there were officers protecting these soldiers, but not a single one of them knew what their men would do – moreover, this was probably not something that would be ordered to them.</t5296>
<t5297>In the distance, a ruined country stretched over a vast area, and the only thing it promised was sorrow.</t5297> <t5298>Every green leaf, every blade of grass and piece of grain had withered and shriveled just as much as those poor people.</t5298> <t5299>Everything was drooping, joyless, devastated, and ruined.</t5299> <t5300>Houses, fences, domestic animals, men, women, children, and the land that gave them life – all were exhausted.</t5300>
<t5301>The Monsignor (who is mostly quite a distinguished gentleman) was a blessing for the country, giving events a chivalrous air; he was a fine example of a luxurious and glittering life and many situations akin to it; yet somehow, along with his class, he had brought the matter to this point.</t5301> <t5302>How strange it is that the "order" established especially for those like the Monsignor would soon collapse!</t5302> <t5303>Apparently, they couldn't see that this order wouldn't last forever!</t5303> <t5304>Indeed, as the last drop of blood stained the stones, and the pulley system of the torture rack began to spin uselessly from the constant turning of the last screw, the Monsignor decided to flee from these vile and incomprehensible matters.</t5304>
<t5305>But in the village and many other villages, nothing had changed.</t5305> <t5306>The Monsignor had oppressed and exploited the village for many years, rarely making an appearance except during hunting seasons – sometimes hunting humans, sometimes animals, and he would ruthlessly clear barren lands to preserve them.</t5306> <t5307>No.</t5307> <t5308>The change was not so much in the absence of the upper class, symbolized by the blessed and blessing face of the Monsignor, but in the emergence of the strange faces of the lower class.</t5308>
<t5309>Meanwhile, the road worker, lost in thought about how little food he had left and how long he could last if he ate it, far from the thought that he came from the earth and would one day return to it, working alone amidst the dust and dirt, looked up and saw a rough-looking man approaching him, the kind that used to be rare in the area but now was frequently encountered.</t5309> <t5310>When the man got closer, the road worker noticed that he was tall, wild-looking, and disheveled, and he wasn't surprised at all. But what did catch his eye were the man's wooden shoes, covered in dust and dirt, caked in mud, soaked in low-lying wet areas, and smeared with thorns, grass, and mold from the secluded paths in the groves, which even to a grim, rough, and sunburnt road worker like himself seemed misshapen.</t5310>
<t5311>The road worker sat on a pile of stones under a ledge he had taken refuge under to escape the downpour, watching this man approach like a ghost in the middle of the day in July.</t5311>
<t5312>Adam looked at the road worker, then at the village in the pit, the mill, and the prison on the rocks.</t5312> <t5313>After placing these locations somewhere in his ignorant mind, he said with a barely understandable accent:</t5313>
<t5314>"How's it going, Jacques?</t5314><t5315>"</t5315>
<t5316>"Everything is fine, Jacques."</t5316><t5317>"</t5317>
<t5318>"Give me your hand then!"</t5318>
<t5319>They shook hands and he also sat on that pile of stones.</t5319>
<t5320>"Do you have food?</t5320><t5321>"</t5321>
<t5322>"There are only a few bites to snack on," said the road worker, with a hungry face.</t5322>
<t5323>"That's the custom!" the man grumbled.</t5323> <t5324>"I couldn't find a meal anywhere I went.</t5324><t5325>"</t5325>
<t5326>Adam took out a darkened pipe and filled it, then lit it with a flint stone. He drew on it until a bright redness formed at the tip, then suddenly pulled it from his mouth and threw a bright object, which he held between his fingers and extinguished as soon as it fell.</t5326>
<t5327>"Shake hands then!" After observing all these procedures, it was the road worker's turn to say this phrase.</t5327> <t5328>They shook hands again.</t5328>
<t5329>"Tonight?" asked the road worker.</t5329>
<t5330>"Tonight!" said the man, bringing the pipe to his mouth.</t5330>
<t5331>"Where?</t5331><t5332>"</t5332>
<t5333>"Here.</t5333><t5334>"</t5334>
<t5335>The road worker and Adam sat silently on the pile of stones, looking at each other while hailstones rained down like bullets and the clouds over the village dispersed.</t5335>
<t5336>Then the traveler advanced towards the slope of the hill and said, "Show me!"</t5336>
<t5337>The road worker said, "Did you see that?" pointing his finger.</t5337> <t5338>"Go down from there and walk straight when you reach the road, then pass the fountain.</t5338><t5339>"</t5339>
<t5340>"For God's sake, stop!" the man interrupted, pointing to the scenery with his eyes.</t5340> <t5341>"I don't walk on such roads or pass by fountains.</t5341> <t5342>Got it?</t5342><t5343>"</t5343>
<t5344>"Alright then! Walk for two hours beyond the peak of that hill above the village."</t5344><t5345>"</t5345>
<t5346>"Good! When will your work be finished?</t5346><t5347>"</t5347>
<t5348>"As the sun sets.</t5348><t5349>"</t5349>
<t5350>"Will you wake me up before you leave?</t5350> <t5351>I've been walking non-stop for two nights.</t5351> <t5352>Let me finish my pipe and sleep here like a child.</t5352> <t5353>Will you wake me up?</t5353><t5354>"</t5354>
<t5355>"Of course."</t5355><t5356>"</t5356>
<t5357>The traveler extinguished his pipe, tucked it into his bosom, and, removing his large wooden shoes, lay down on his back on the pile of stones.</t5357> <t5358>He fell asleep as soon as he lay down.</t5358>
<t5359>When the road worker returned to his dusty job and the clouds dispersed in the sky, making way for bright rays that cast silvery glimmers on the scenery, the small man (now wearing a red hat instead of his blue one) seemed mesmerized by the man lying on this pile of stones.</t5359><t5360>His eyes frequently drifted to the man, and he used his tools almost absentmindedly, even a bit clumsily.</t5360><t5361>The man's bronze face, his tangled hair and beard, his red woolen hat, his handmade outfit pieced together from various cheap fabrics and hides, his strong body thinned from a life of scarcity, and his lips tightly shut in a sullen and hopeless manner as he slept, evoked a mixture of respect and fear in the road worker.</t5361><t5362>It was evident that the traveler had come from a very long distance; his feet were swollen and covered in wounds. It must have been difficult to drag those large shoes filled with leaves and grass for so many hours, and just as he was battered, his clothes were also torn and tattered.</t5362><t5363>The road worker bent over the man to see if he was hiding a weapon in his bosom, but it was in vain, for the man had his arms tightly crossed over his chest, just like his lips.</t5363><t5364>The road worker thought that cities protected by embankments, watchtowers, gates, ditches, and drawbridges were nothing for a figure of this stature.</t5364><t5365>When he lifted his eyes from the man and looked at the horizon, he vaguely saw that such unstoppable men covered all of France.</t5365>
<t5366>Adam, the torrential rain, the intermittently shining sun, the sun that would appear and disappear on his face, the hailstones that would patter on his body and then turn into diamonds under the effect of the sun, without paying any heed to them, continued to sleep until the sun lowered in the west and the sky turned crimson.</t5366> <t5367>After a while, when the road worker was ready to gather his tools and descend to the village, he woke him up.</t5367>
<t5368>"Alright!" said the sleeping man, straightening up on his elbow.</t5368> <t5369>"Two hours away from the top of the hill, right?</t5369><t5370>"</t5370>
<t5371>"More or less.</t5371><t5372>"</t5372>
<t5373>"More or less.</t5373> <t5374>Alright!"</t5374>
<t5375>The road worker, pushing the dust and dirt ahead of him with the blowing wind, moved towards the house and, shortly after reaching the fountain, mingled with the skinny cows brought to drink water, pretended to whisper to them, and whispered something to the whole village.</t5375> <t5376>After the villagers had a snack with the intention of dinner, they did not go to bed as usual but came out to their doorsteps again and waited.</t5376> <t5377>The strange whisper had spread everywhere, and when the villagers gathered at the fountain in the dark, everyone looked in the same direction in the sky with hopeful eyes, as if it had spread from one to another.</t5377> <t5378>Monsieur Gabelle, who was responsible for that region, was alarmed; he climbed to the roof of his house alone and also looked in that direction; he glanced at the increasingly darkening faces at the fountain below from behind the chimneys and soon sent word to the sexton, who kept the church keys, thinking that the bell might need to be rung.</t5378>
<t5379>The darkness had fallen completely.</t5379> <t5380>The trees surrounding the old castle, ignoring its desolate state, were swaying threateningly in the wind, as if to challenge its massive dark bulk in the gloom of the night.</t5380> <t5381>The rain had assaulted the staircase between the two floors, pounding on the main door like an anxious messenger trying to wake those inside; the restless wind passed through the old spears and knives in the corridor, moaning as it ascended the stairs and rustled the curtains of the bed where the last Marquis once slept.</t5381> <t5382>From the east, west, north, and south, four ragged-looking men emerged from among the trees, walking cautiously with large steps, crushing the tall grass and snapping the branches as they moved towards the courtyard.</t5382> <t5383>Then four torches flared up and they all dispersed in different directions, after which everything was plunged back into darkness.</t5383>
<t5384>But this did not last very long.</t5384> <t5385>Soon, the castle became more distinct, illuminated by a light from within itself.</t5385> <t5386>This trembling light inside revealed the bars, arches, and windows.</t5386> <t5387>Then the light grew even more and became brighter as it spread around.</t5387> <t5388>Soon, flames were bursting from the large windows, and the stone faces awakened from their sleep were watching the fire.</t5388>
<t5389>Indistinct sounds rose from the few people remaining in the castle, and a horse was saddled and galloped away.</t5389> <t5390>In the darkness, the sound of spurs and splashing water was heard, and as they reached the village fountain, the reins were pulled; the horse, foaming, stopped in front of Monsieur Gabelle's door.</t5390> <t5391>"Help, Gabelle!</t5391> <t5392>Help!" The bell was ringing impatiently, but there was no one else to help.</t5392> <t5393>The road worker and his two hundred and fifty companions stood with their arms crossed in front of the fountain, watching the flames rising to the sky.</t5393> <t5394>"It must be about twelve meters high," they said grimly, but did not move from their spots.</t5394>
<t5395>The rider coming from the castle and the foam-covered horse galloped through the village and climbed the stony hill to the prison atop the rocks.</t5395> <t5396>A group of officers at the door, and a little further ahead, a group of soldiers were watching the fire.</t5396> <t5397>"Help, officers!</t5397> <t5398>The castle is burning; if we intervene in time, we can save valuable items from the flames!</t5398> <t5399>Help, come on, help please!" The officers looked towards the soldiers watching the fire; they gave no orders and, shrugging their shoulders and biting their lips, they simply said, "Let it burn then."</t5399>
<t5400>As the horseman descended the hill and passed through the village again, the village had begun to light up.</t5400> <t5401>The road worker and his two hundred and fifty companions, moved by the idea of illuminating the surroundings, rushed to their homes like a single man and woman and placed a candle in front of each dim windowpane.</t5401> <t5402>Since candles, like everything else, were scarce, they demanded candles from Monsieur Gabelle in an authoritative manner, and when this important figure acted reluctantly and hesitantly, even the road worker, who had once been so obedient to authority, suggested that the carriages were quite suitable for lighting bonfires and that it would be good to cook the post coach's horses on them.</t5402>
<t5403>The castle was abandoned to the flames and burning.</t5403> <t5404>The roaring, furious fire, with its crimson wind, was sweeping the massive building as if it had come straight from hell.</t5404> <t5405>As the flames rose and fell, the stone faces seemed to be in agony.</t5405> <t5406>When huge stones and timbers fell from the building, the stone face with two holes for a nose also disappeared from view, but soon reappeared among the smoke, as if it were the face of the cruel Marquis battling the flames while burning at the stake.</t5406>
<t5407>The castle burned fiercely; the nearest trees, where the flames leapt, were scorched and shriveled; the distant trees set on fire by those four furious men surrounded the burning castle with a new cloud of smoke.</t5407> <t5408>The bottom of the marble pool was impassable with molten lead and iron; its water had completely dried up; the tops of the towers had melted like ice in the heat, dripping drop by drop into the four fierce pits of flame.</t5408> <t5409>Huge cracks and fissures, as if crystallized, had formed in the solid walls; bewildered birds were circling around, being drawn into the furnace; the four furious men, guided by their lanterns, trudged wearily along the paths hidden by the night, towards their next targets to the east, west, north, and south.</t5409> <t5410>The illuminated village, having seized the bell, was ringing it joyfully, disregarding the legitimate bell-ringer.</t5410>
<t5411>It wasn't just these; hunger, fire, and the incessant ringing of bells had left the villagers, who were already frustrated with Gabelle for collecting rent and taxes –though Gabelle was collecting taxes in small amounts and no longer collecting rent– eager to meet with him, surrounding his house and calling him out to speak face-to-face.</t5411> <t5412>Upon this, Monsieur Gabelle tightly bolted his door and retreated to his room to decide what to do.</t5412> <t5413>After pondering for a while, he decided to climb onto the roof of his house and hide behind the chimneys; this time he was determined, if they broke down the door and came in, he would jump over the railings (after all, he was a small but vengeful southerner) and crush a few of them to death.</t5413>
<t5414>The night, accompanied by the image of the distant castle that gave him warmth and light, the knocking door, and the cheerful bell music, probably seemed never-ending for Monsieur Gabelle; the ominous lamp swinging directly opposite the post office door only added salt to the wound, as the villagers were very eager to use it in his honor.</t5414> <t5415>Spending an entire summer night waiting on the shore of a dark ocean, ready to jump at any moment according to his decision, was a highly distressing situation for Monsieur Gabelle!</t5415> <t5416>But finally, when the sweet dawn broke, and the flickering candles burning in the village melted away, people dispersed in joy, and Monsieur Gabelle, with his life still intact for now, descended.</t5416>
<t5417>Within an area of approximately one hundred and seventy kilometers and in the light of other fires, the sun rising at the end of that night and other nights found other tax collectors who were not as lucky as Gabelle hanging in the old peaceful streets where they were born and raised; on the other hand, there were other peasants and townspeople who were not as lucky as the road worker and his comrades, and in situations where the tax collectors and soldiers prevailed, this time they were the ones hanging from the poles.</t5417> <t5418>But the furious four continued to advance steadily to the east, west, north, and south, hanging whoever came in their way, burning and destroying everything.</t5418> <t5419>No official, no matter how much they thought and calculated, could bring the water to the height of the gallows to extinguish it.</t5419>
<t5420>XXIV</t5420>
<t5421>Drifting Towards the "Magnet Rock Cliff"</t5421>
<t5422>Amidst rising fires and swelling seas – even the land, which stood firm against the raging ocean's assault, had shifted, and the receding of the seawater was out of the question now, it kept rising continuously in front of the anxious and curious eyes waiting on the shore – three stormy years had passed.</t5422> <t5423>In little Lucie's house, three birthdays had been woven into the peaceful fabric of the home with golden threads.</t5423>
<t5424>There were such days and nights that the residents of the house listened to the sounds coming from the corner, and when they realized these were footsteps, their hearts skipped a beat.</t5424> <t5425>For according to them, these sounds were from noisy people walking under a red flag, who turned into terrifying creatures when it was declared that their country was in danger, and who had long been part of this spell.</t5425>
<t5426>Like others in his class, the Monsignor had not spent much time pondering the thought of being unappreciated, but he was quick to realize the fact that he was no longer wanted in France, and thus was in danger of being sent away from here, or even from this world.</t5426> <t5427>The Monsignor's situation was just like the peasant in the fable, who, after raising the Devil with great difficulty and then being terrified by its appearance, fled without asking his Enemy anything; after years of recklessly disregarding God's commands and performing powerful spells that revived Evil, he chose to grease his noble heels and run away instead of standing there and continuing to watch this horror.</t5427>
<t5428>The palace no longer had its glittering window, and even if it had remained, it would have been a target for the people's rain of bullets.</t5428> <t5429>This had never been a window looked upon favorably by people – it always contained traces of Lucifer's pride, Sardanapalus's splendor, and a mole's blindness – but it had now disappeared.</t5429> <t5430>Everything from the privileged inner circle of the palace to its intrigue, corruption, and hypocrisy-filled outer circle had come to an end.</t5430> <t5431>The monarchy had ended; with the arrival of the final waves, it had been cornered and "suspended" in its own Palace.</t5431><t5432>"</t5432>
<t5433>By the time August of the year 1792 arrived, Monseigneur was already far away.</t5433>
<t5434>Naturally, the headquarters of the Monsignor in London and the meeting place with others was Tellson Bank.</t5434> <t5435>Spirits are said to wander where their bodies were most often during their lifetime; the penniless Monsignor was now where his money once lay.</t5435> <t5436>Moreover, this was the first point where the most reliable news from France arrived.</t5436> <t5437>Furthermore, Tellson Bank was a generous institution and behaved with great liberality towards its former clients who had lost their property.</t5437> <t5438>Additionally, some nobles, who foresaw the approaching storm and expected looting and foreclosure, prudently transferred their money to Tellson in England, which was known to other impoverished members of the order.</t5438> <t5439>It should be added at this point that every newcomer from France both provided information about themselves and brought news to Tellson.</t5439> <t5440>For these reasons, at that time, Tellson had become a kind of information repository for the French; this was well known by the public, and the number of those asking questions to obtain information had increased so much that Tellson sometimes posted the latest news in a few lines on the windows of the bank for those coming and going at Temple Bar to read.</t5440>
<t5441>On a hazy and murky afternoon, Mr. Lorry was seated at his desk, with Charles Darnay leaning over beside him, whispering something to him in a low voice.</t5441> <t5442>In the sanctuary of atonement, which was initially reserved for company meetings, a tremendous exchange of information was now taking place, and the room was overflowing.</t5442> <t5443>There was approximately half an hour left until the bank closed.</t5443>
<t5444>"But despite being the most youthful-spirited person I have ever seen," said Darnay, hesitating a bit, "what I want to say is...</t5444><t5445>"</t5445>
<t5446>"I understand, okay.</t5446> <t5447>Am I too old?" asked Mr. Lorry.</t5447>
<t5448>"What I mean is, the weather is unstable, the road is very long, it's unclear how you will travel, the country is in chaos, and the city is not safe for you at all.</t5448><t5449>"</t5449>
<t5450>"Dear Charles!" said Mr. Lorry, in a cheerful confidence, "You mentioned some reasons explaining my departure, not reasons requiring me to stay elsewhere.</t5450> <t5451>There is nothing to fear; with so many people worth dealing with around, no one would bother with an old man like me who is nearing eighty.</t5451> <t5452>As for the city's turmoil, if there wasn't such a situation, they wouldn't send someone to that branch, someone who has known the city and the business for a long time, on behalf of Tellson.</t5452> <t5453>As for the uncertainty of travel means, the length of the journey, and adverse weather conditions, if I don't endure this small hardship for Tellson after all these years, who will?</t5453><t5454>"</t5454>
<t5455>"I wish I had gone," said Charles Darnay, somewhat uneasy and as if thinking aloud.</t5455>
<t5456>"Oh dear, oh dear!"</t5456> <t5457>"Look at this sweet man who objects and gives me advice!" shouted Mr. Lorry.</t5457> <t5458>"Did you say you wish you had gone instead?</t5458> <t5459>And you are French.</t5459> <t5460>You are a smart man.</t5460><t5461>"</t5461>
<t5462>"Dear Mr. Lorry, since I am already French (actually, I didn't want to bring up this matter here), I want to go.</t5462> <t5463>Those poor people can only listen to and be calmed by someone who understands their situation and has sacrificed a lot for them," Darnay said thoughtfully, as before.</t5463> <t5464>Just last night, while talking to Lucie after you left...</t5464><t5465>"</t5465>
<t5466>"While talking to Lucie?" repeated Mr. Lorry.</t5466> <t5467>"Of course."</t5467> <t5468>You say you wish to go to France, and then you don't feel ashamed to mention Lucie's name!</t5468><t5469>"</t5469>
<t5470>"I'm not going anyway," said Charles Darnay with a smile.</t5470> <t5471>"You are the one who is actually planning this trip.</t5471><t5472>"</t5472>
<t5473>"You are right.</t5473> <t5474>Honestly, dear Charles," said Mr. Lorry, glancing at the distant bank manager and lowering his voice, "you cannot even imagine how difficult our work is and the danger that the papers and documents over there are in.</t5474> <t5475>If some of our documents are seized or destroyed, God knows what troubles will befall us, how many lives will be turned upside down, and you know, this can happen at any moment. Who can say that Paris won't be set on fire or looted any day now?</t5475> <t5476>Therefore, without much delay, it falls to me to make a reasonable selection from these documents and eliminate them before any disaster befalls them (without wasting this precious time).</t5476> <t5477>While Tellson's – the institution I've served for sixty years – is aware of this situation and asks this of me, should I abandon them just because my joints are a bit stiff?</t5477> <t5478>Why would I do that?</t5478> <t5479>Among the half dozen antique men over there, I am considered a young man!</t5479><t5480>"</t5480>
<t5481>"I admire the courage of your young spirit, Mr. Lorry."</t5481><t5482>"</t5482>
<t5483>"No way!</t5483> <t5484>It's not like that actually! –Now dear Charles," said Mr. Lorry, glancing at the bank again, "remember, at this time, getting anything out of Paris, whatever it may be, is next to impossible.</t5484> <t5485>Just today, they brought us some documents and valuable items (I can't give too much information, I can't even hint at it to you, it's that kind of job) and you can probably guess the state of the people who brought them, since each of them was walking on a razor's edge while crossing the border.</t5485> <t5486>In the past, our parcels used to come and go easily for business, just like in old England, but now everything has stopped.</t5486><t5487>"</t5487>
<t5488>"So, are you really leaving tonight?</t5488><t5489>"</t5489>
<t5490>"Yes, I'm leaving tonight; events have escalated, there's no time to waste anymore."</t5490><t5491>"</t5491>
<t5492>"Aren't you taking someone with you?</t5492><t5493>"</t5493>
<t5494>"They suggested a lot of men to accompany me, but none of them felt right.</t5494> <t5495>I'm planning to take Jerry.</t5495> <t5496>He's been guarding me on Sunday nights for a long time, and I've gotten quite used to him.</t5496> <t5497>Nobody would suspect Jerry; everyone immediately understands that he's the kind of English guard dog that would pounce on anyone who tries to attack his owner.</t5497><t5498>"</t5498>
<t5499>"I cannot help but once again express my sincere admiration for your courage and youth."</t5499><t5500>"</t5500>
<t5501>"No way, it's not that bad!</t5501> <t5502>After completing this small task, I might accept Tellson's retirement offer and retreat to my own corner.</t5502> <t5503>Then, I suppose, I would have enough time to consider myself old.</t5503><t5504>"</t5504>
<t5505>While they were talking about these things at Mr. Lorry's desk, a little further away, the Monsignor, foaming with rage, was boasting about how he would soon take revenge on those scoundrels.</t5505> <t5506>It was too much for a refugee of the Monsignor's status, and in a manner not at all befitting English conservatism, to speak of this terrible revolution as if it were the only crop ever harvested under the sky despite never being sown – as if nothing had been done to cause all this or as if the necessary actions had not been neglected; as if those who had observed the miserable condition of millions in France and the misuse and corruption of resources that could provide them with a prosperous life had not seen the revolution inevitably approaching years ago and had not recorded what they saw in plain language.</t5506> <t5507>While things were boiling over like this, and the Monsignor was engaging in endless intrigues to remedy the current state that had exhausted itself and, along with it, the earth and the sky, any sensible man who knew the truth would not tolerate this situation and would object.</t5507> <t5508>Already uneasy, Charles Darnay's anxiety increased even more after all this talk, as if his blood had rushed to his head.</t5508>
<t5509>Among the speakers was Stryver from the Royal Bar, whose voice was loud because his promotion was at risk.</t5509> <t5510>He was telling the Monsignor about finishing off the people, wiping them off the face of the earth, and what needed to be done for a life without them, and he was talking about what they aimed to do to eradicate eagles, a race close to them by nature.</t5510> <t5511>Darnay could not stand his speech the most, and stood there wavering between leaving to avoid hearing these words and staying to give them a piece of his mind.</t5511>
<t5512>The Bank Manager approached Mr. Lorry and placed a dirty and unopened letter in front of him, asking if there was any news regarding the person to whom it was sent.</t5512> <t5513>The letter was so close to Darnay that he immediately read the name on it – he read it very quickly, because it was his own name.</t5513> <t5514>In the address section, translated into English, the following was written:</t5514>
<t5515>"Very urgent.</t5515> <t5516>To the former Marquis of St Evremonde of France.</t5516> <t5517>By the hand of Tellson's Bank, London, England.</t5517><t5518>"</t5518>
<t5519>On the morning of the wedding, Dr. Manette had only one special request from Charles Darnay, and that was for this name to remain a secret between them – unless he, the Doctor, wished otherwise.</t5519> <t5520>Nobody else knew his real name; his wife had not the slightest suspicion, and Mr. Lorry could not have had any either.</t5520>
<t5521>"No," replied Mr. Lorry to the manager, "I asked everyone who came here, but no one knows where this gentleman is."</t5521><t5522>"</t5522>
<t5523>When the clock showed the bank's closing time, a crowd of people began to pass by Mr. Lorry's desk, chatting away.</t5523> <t5524>Mr. Lorry tried to gather information from people by showing the letter one by one; an angry refugee in the position of a scheming Monsignor looked, another angry refugee in the position of a scheming Monsignor looked; this one, that one, and the other one all looked, and each had something derogatory to say in French or English about the missing Marquis.</t5524>
<t5525>"Apparently, the nephew of the murdered kind Marquis – but in any case, a degenerate heir – I think it's this person," said one of them.</t5525> <t5526>"Luckily, I never knew him.</t5526><t5527>"</t5527>
<t5528>"A coward who abandoned his home and country a few years ago," said another – "this Monsignor was also smuggled out of Paris with his head buried in straw, legs up in the air, barely able to breathe.</t5528><t5529>"</t5529>
<t5530>"He was influenced by the new doctrines," said the third person as he passed by, holding his single monocle in that direction; "he opposed the last Marquis, rejected all the property inherited from him, and left it all to those coarse human masses.</t5530> <t5531>Now, whatever he deserves, they will probably give it to him.</t5531><t5532>"</t5532>
<t5533>"Come on, really?" shouted the loudmouth Stryver; "Did he really do that?</t5533> <t5534>What kind of man is this?</t5534> <t5535>Show me the name of that scoundrel.</t5535> <t5536>Damn bastard!</t5536><t5537>"</t5537>
<t5538>Darnay, unable to restrain himself any longer, touched Mr. Stryver's shoulder and said:</t5538>
<t5539>"I know that man.</t5539><t5540>"</t5540>
<t5541>"Really?" said Stryver.</t5541> <t5542>"I'm sorry to hear that."</t5542><t5543>"</t5543>
<t5544>"Why?"</t5544>
<t5545>"Why, Mr. Darnay?</t5545> <t5546>Haven't you heard what he has done?</t5546> <t5547>In such a time, is it appropriate to ask why?</t5547><t5548>"</t5548>
<t5549>"But I am asking."</t5549><t5550>"</t5550>
<t5551>"Then let me say it again, Mr. Darnay, I am sorry that you know this man.</t5551> <t5552>I am also sorry that you ask me such strange questions.</t5552> <t5553>This man has conformed to the most miserable and vile devilries ever, left his property to the world's most despicable scum who commit mass murder, and a gentleman like you asks me why I am sorry.</t5553> <t5554>But I will still explain.</t5554> <t5555>I am sorry because such vile ideas are contagious.</t5555> <t5556>That's how it is.</t5556><t5557>"</t5557>
<t5558>Darnay, keeping his secret in mind and making a great effort not to reveal it, said: "Perhaps you misunderstood this gentleman."</t5558><t5559>"</t5559>
<t5560>"I understand how to corner you, Mr. Darnay," said Zorba Stryver, "and I will corner you.</t5560> <t5561>If he is a gentleman, I couldn't understand it.</t5561> <t5562>You can convey this to him with my respects.</t5562> <t5563>Please ask him for me why, after leaving all his property and reputation to that bloodthirsty mob, he didn't stay at the forefront.</t5563> <t5564>But no, gentlemen," said Stryver, looking around and snapping his fingers, "I understand a bit about human nature, and believe me, men like him do not sacrifice themselves in life for those very precious men they favor.</t5564> <t5565>No, gentlemen; these people show up at the very beginning of the hustle and bustle with their shiny shoes, and then they vanish.</t5565><t5566>"</t5566>
<t5567>Mr. Stryver, after snapping his fingers one last time following these words, headed towards Fleet Street amidst the admiring glances of those listening to his speech.</t5567> <t5568>Everyone had left, and Mr. Lorry and Charles Darnay were left alone at the table.</t5568>
<t5569>"Will you take care of the letter?" said Mr. Lorry.</t5569> <t5570>"Do you know where to take it?</t5570><t5571>"</t5571>
<t5572>"I know.</t5572><t5573>"</t5573>
<t5574>"Can you explain to him that we assumed this letter was sent here, thinking we knew where it was to be delivered, and that it has been here for a while?</t5574><t5575>"</t5575>
<t5576>"Okay, I'll tell you.</t5576> <t5577>Are you departing for Paris from here?</t5577><t5578>"</t5578>
<t5579>"Yes, at eight o'clock."</t5579><t5580>"</t5580>
<t5581>"I will come again to see you off."</t5581><t5582>"</t5582>
<t5583>Extremely uncomfortable with himself, Stryver, and the other men, Darnay withdrew to a quiet corner of the Temple, opened the letter, and read it.</t5583> <t5584>It contained the following:</t5584>
<t5585>Abbaye Prison, Paris</t5585>
<t5586>June 21, 1792</t5586>
<t5587>The Former Marquis of France, Monsieur,</t5587>
<t5588>After being captured, I was brought to Paris on foot following the terrible days I spent in the hands of the villagers under great violence and insult.</t5588> <t5589>I suffered greatly during this long journey.</t5589> <t5590>As if that wasn't enough, they also destroyed my home – they razed it to the ground.</t5590>
<t5591>The former Marquis of France, Monsieur, the crime that caused my arrest and my imminent appearance before the judge, and (if deprived of your generous help) will cost me my life, they say, is that I betrayed the vast majority of the people and turned them against me because of a refugee.</t5591> <t5592>It does no good to say that I acted not against them, but for them, according to your orders.</t5592> <t5593>It also does no good to explain that before the confiscation of refugee properties, I forgave tax debts, did not collect rent, and took no action.</t5593> <t5594>The only thing they tell me is, you worked for a refugee, and where is that refugee.</t5594>
<t5595>Ah! Former Marquis of France, dear Monsieur, where do you think this refugee is?</t5595> <t5596>Even in my sleep, I mutter about where he might be.</t5596> <t5597>I pray to God to send him to me.</t5597> <t5598>But it is of no use.</t5598> <t5599>Ah, Former Marquis of France, Monsieur, in the hope that something might reach your ears through Tellson's Bank in Paris, I send my desperate cries across the seas!</t5599>
<t5600>For the love of God, in the name of justice, and for the greatness and honor of your noble name, I beg you to save me, Monsieur the Former Marquis of France.</t5600> <t5601>My only fault was being loyal to you.</t5601> <t5602>Oh Monsieur the Former Marquis of France, I beg you to be loyal to me as well!</t5602>
<t5603>Former Marquis of France, Monsieur, I send you my sorrowful and unhappy service from this fear-filled dungeon, where each passing day brings me closer to death.</t5603>
<t5604>Your loyal servant</t5604>
<t5605>Salt tax</t5605>
<t5606>Darnay, who was already uneasy, became even more worried with this letter.</t5606> <t5607>This old and good servant, whose only crime was being loyal to him and his family, had looked at Darnay with such a reproachful expression due to the danger he was in that Darnay, not knowing what to do, had walked back and forth in Temple, almost hiding his face from passersby.</t5607>
<t5608>The fear created in him by the evil deeds of his old family and their bad reputation, the hurtful suspicions he harbored towards his uncle, and the dissatisfaction awakened in his conscience by the scattered pieces he needed to gather made him aware that he was not behaving as he should.</t5608> <t5609>He was also fully aware that his renunciation of his social status for his love for Lucie, although not a new thought in his mind, was rushed and incomplete.</t5609> <t5610>He knew that he needed to handle and manage this matter systematically, but it hadn't happened.</t5610>
<t5611>His own family happiness, the necessity of being constantly occupied with work, all the changes and troubles were following one another at such a great speed that the events of this week were obliterating the undeveloped plans of the previous week, everything was being planned anew for the next week, and Darnay felt the weight of all these developments that he let flow over him; he was not without anxiety, but he also did not have a constant and steadily increasing resistance.</t5611> <t5612>He was observing the developing events, changes, and struggles from where he stood each passing day; Darnay knew as well as the new authority in France, which was least likely to accuse him, that the nobles in France were fleeing by any means they could find, their properties were being confiscated and destroyed, and their names were being erased one by one.</t5612>
<t5613>He had never oppressed anyone, never had anyone arrested; he had not collected taxes from the people by force, and when giving away his possessions, he did so willingly. He had thrown himself into a world where he had no privileges, achieved something through his own efforts, and earned his own bread.</t5613> <t5614>Mr. Gabelle had managed the land in accordance with written orders, distributing the basic necessities to people little by little – firewood in winter as much as the cruel creditors allowed, and in summer, crops to the extent they could wrest from them – and of course, Gabelle, albeit late, had presented this situation as evidence in his defense to save his life.</t5614>
<t5615>This situation had cemented Charles Darnay's desperate decision to go to Paris.</t5615>
<t5616>Here.</t5616> <t5617>Just like the sailor in the old story, he was being drifted towards the Magnet Stone Cliff by winds and currents, and Paris was drawing him in the same way, and he had to go.</t5617> <t5618>Everything that came to his mind was dragging him towards this terrible center of attraction with greater speed and even more stability.</t5618> <t5619>While the sorrowful lands had fallen into the hands of ill-intentioned people, his mere sitting there made Darnay very uneasy, and he could do nothing to stop the flowing blood, only hoping for mercy and humanity.</t5619> <t5620>Under the influence of this uneasiness that both suffocated and saddened him, he found himself comparing with the brave and old gentleman with a strong sense of duty; immediately after this touching comparison (which was quite humiliating for him), he remembered Monsignor's sarcastic and mocking words and Stryver's rude and hurtful remarks regarding old matters.</t5620> <t5621>As if these were not enough, he then thought of Gabelle's letter; an innocent prisoner in mortal danger was seeking help from his justice, honor, and high name.</t5621>
<t5622>He had made his decision.</t5622> <t5623>He had to go to Paris.</t5623>
<t5624>Yes.</t5624> <t5625>The Magnetic Stone Cliff was pulling Darnay towards itself, and he had to keep going until he crashed into the cliffs.</t5625> <t5626>Darnay was unaware of the rock; he saw no danger in this.</t5626> <t5627>Even if he left what he intended to do unfinished, when he went to France and explained it, it would be met with great appreciation.</t5627> <t5628>Then the splendid image of this good deed appeared before him like an optimistic mirage belonging to many noble minds, and he even imagined that it had the power to influence this furious revolution advancing with a terrible madness.</t5628>
<t5629>With this decision in mind, while walking up and down the street, he decided that neither Lucie nor Doctor Manette should be aware of it until he left.</t5629> <t5630>Lucie should not experience the pain of separation, and her father, who was always ready to return to the dangerous old days, should see it not as a cause for worry and suspicion but as a step taken.</t5630> <t5631>Since he avoided with sorrowful anxiety evoking the old days in France in the Doctor's mind, it was debatable how appropriate it would be to talk to him about the void inside.</t5631> <t5632>But this was a matter in itself.</t5632>
<t5633>He continued to walk back and forth, his mind occupied with these thoughts, until it was time to return to Tellson's and bid farewell to Mr. Lorry.</t5633> <t5634>He would go to his old friend as soon as he arrived in Paris, but for now, he should not mention this intention to him.</t5634>
<t5635>A horse-drawn mail coach was waiting in front of the bank, and Jerry, fully equipped with boots on his feet, was ready.</t5635>
<t5636>"I delivered the letter," said Charles Darnay to Mr. Lorry.</t5636> <t5637>"I didn't want to put you in a difficult position by giving a written response, but can we send a message verbally?</t5637><t5638>"</t5638>
<t5639>"If it's not something dangerous, of course," said Mr. Lorry, "gladly."</t5639><t5640>"</t5640>
<t5641>"It's definitely not dangerous.</t5641> <t5642>Although it's going to a prisoner in Abbaye.</t5642><t5643>"</t5643>
<t5644>"What is his name?" asked Mr. Lorry, opening his small notebook.</t5644>
<t5645>"Gabelle."</t5645><t5646>"</t5646>
<t5647>"Gabelle."</t5647> <t5648>"So, what message shall we send to this unfortunate prisoner in jail?"</t5648><t5649>"</t5649>
<t5650>"In short, you say, 'he read the letter, he will come.'</t5650><t5651>"</t5651>
<t5652>"Will we specify the time?</t5652><t5653>"</t5653>
<t5654>"He will set out tomorrow night."</t5654><t5655>"</t5655>
<t5656>"So, are we going to name someone?"</t5656><t5657>"</t5657>
<t5658>"No.</t5658><t5659>"</t5659>
<t5660>After helping Mr. Lorry wrap himself in layers of cardigans and cloaks, they stepped together from the warm air of the old bank into the misty air of Fleet Street.</t5660> <t5661>As Mr. Lorry departed, he said, "Please give my regards to Lucie and little Lucie, and take good care of them until I return." As the carriage moved away, Charles Darnay nodded with a doubtful smile.</t5661>
<t5662>That night –on the fourteenth of August– he stayed up late and wrote two letters fervently; one was to Lucie, in which he explained at length the necessity of going to Paris, why it was essential, and how confident he was that nothing would happen to him there; the other letter was to Doctor Manette, entrusting Lucie and her dear little girls to him, and emphasizing the matters mentioned in the other letter.</t5662> <t5663>He wrote to both that he would send letters proving his well-being as soon as he arrived there.</t5663>
<t5664>It had been difficult for Charles to spend that day with them, with the thought that they would be separated for the first time in his mind.</t5664> <t5665>Hiding this innocent lie, which they had no suspicion of, was an exhausting situation.</t5665> <t5666>On the other hand, the affectionate look he directed at his happy and occupied wife further strengthened his decision not to tell her what awaited them (otherwise, he would have almost opened up to her, it was very strange to act without her calm support) and thus the day passed quickly.</t5666> <t5667>In the evening, he hugged Lucie and her equally precious namesake, and saying he would return before it got too late (supposedly he had some work to do and his suitcase with clothes in it was hidden in a corner), he merged into the heavy and foggy air of the street with a heavy heart.</t5667>
<t5668>An invisible force was now swiftly pulling him towards itself, and all the currents and winds were supporting this with all their might.</t5668> <t5669>He left both letters with a reliable messenger to be delivered exactly half an hour before midnight and started his journey by mounting his horse to head to Dover.</t5669> <t5670>As he was being drawn towards the Magnet Stone Rock, leaving the most valuable things in the world behind, his shattered heart found strength in the poor prisoner's words, "For the love of God, for the sake of justice, and for the greatness and honor of your noble name!"</t5670>
<t5671>Third Chapter</t5671>
<t5672>The Path of the Storm</t5672>
<t5673>I</t5673>
<t5674>Secret</t5674>
<t5675>In the autumn of 1792, the traveler who set out from England to go to France progressed slowly on his way.</t5675> <t5676>Even if the unfortunate King of France had been sitting on his throne in all his splendor, he would have been delayed in reaching his destination due to all those bad roads, poor equipment, and bad horses, but the changing times harbored other obstacles as well.</t5676> <t5677>At the entrance of each village and in front of the tax office, a group of patriots, with rifles ready to fire in their hands, stopped passersby, subjected them to cross-examination, examined their documents, checked their names against their own lists, and in the name of the approaching "Republic and Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death," they either sent them back, allowed them to continue on their way, or stopped and arrested them, whichever they deemed most appropriate at the moment.</t5677>
<t5678>Charles Darnay realized that very shortly after arriving on French soil, it was impossible to return from these roads until he was declared a good citizen in Paris.</t5678> <t5679>Whatever happened to him, he had to go to the end of the road.</t5679> <t5680>No village had turned him back, no barrier had been set in his way yet, but it felt to him as if there was a tightly bolted iron gate stretching between himself and England.</t5680> <t5681>He was in such great anxiety that even if he had been caught in a net or was being taken to his destination in a cage, he could not have felt his freedom being taken away as much as he did.</t5681>
<t5682>This great unease not only made him stop twenty times a day on the road, but also delayed him twenty times from his path; sometimes a rider would come from behind and turn him back from his path; sometimes he would suddenly become suspicious while going ahead and stop him; sometimes he would go alongside him, not taking his eyes off him.</t5682> <t5683>When he threw himself into bed in a small town on his way, still very far from Paris, in an utterly exhausted state, days had passed since his solitary journey in France had begun.</t5683>
<t5684>Nothing but the sorrowful letter from Gabelle in the Abbaye Prison could have brought him this far.</t5684> <t5685>They had cornered him so much at the police station in this small place that he had the feeling his journey would end here.</t5685> <t5686>Therefore, he was not at all surprised when someone came to the small inn where he was staying in the middle of the night and woke him up.</t5686>
<t5687>Darnay had been awakened by a timid official and three armed citizens, who were sitting on the bed with pipes in their mouths and coarse red caps on their heads.</t5687>
<t5688>"Refugee!" said the officer, "I will send you to Paris with an escort.</t5688><t5689>"</t5689>
<t5690>"Citizen, I already want nothing more than to go to Paris, but there is no need for an escort.</t5690><t5691>"</t5691>
<t5692>"Wait a minute!" grumbled the man with the red cap, hitting the bedspread with the tip of his rifle.</t5692> <t5693>"Calm down, aristocrat!"</t5693>
<t5694>"As your patriotic friend said," said the timid official, "you are an aristocrat and you will pay for the escort.</t5694><t5695>"</t5695>
<t5696>"I guess I have no other choice," said Charles Darnay.</t5696>
<t5697>"Luck? Look at this!" shouted the same frowning, red-capped officer.</t5697> <t5698>"We save the man from being hung on a lamppost, and look at what he says!</t5698><t5699>"</t5699>
<t5700>"As your patriotic friend said," said the officer.</t5700> <t5701>"Get up and get dressed, refugee.</t5701><t5702>"</t5702>
<t5703>Darnay carried out what was told to him and was taken back to the military post where other patriots with rough red caps were smoking pipes, drinking, and sleeping by the signal fire.</t5703> <t5704>After paying his escorts a substantial amount of money here, they set off together through the wet streets at three in the morning.</t5704>
<t5705>Two escorts with red caps and badges, on their horses, advanced on either side of Darnay with their rifles and cavalry swords in hand.</t5705> <t5706>Although the escorted man managed his own horse, a rope was tied to its reins, and one of the citizens had wrapped the other end of the rope around his own wrist.</t5706> <t5707>In this state, they advanced accompanied by the harsh rain hitting their faces; they moved slowly and clumsily on the rugged pavements, trudging through the mud.</t5707> <t5708>In this state, without changing anything except their horses and speed, they zigzagged along the muddy roads leading to the capital.</t5708>
<t5709>They traveled throughout the night and took a break a couple of hours after dawn, resting until dusk fell.</t5709> <t5710>The escorts' clothing was so shabby that the men had wrapped straw around their bare legs and covered their tattered shoulders with the same straw to protect themselves from the rain.</t5710> <t5711>Despite the discomfort of being followed so closely and the danger posed by one of the escorts carelessly carrying a rifle while constantly drinking, Charles Darnay tried to keep his heart light and not let the pressure weigh him down; for it was pointless to fear an unopened case and the kind of statements that a prisoner in the Abbaye could approve of.</t5711>
<t5712>When they arrived in the town of Beauvais – at a time in the evening when the streets were teeming with people – it was not at all difficult to see that the situation was grave.</t5712> <t5713>The crowd gathered in the post yard to see his arrival was shouting in unison, "Let the refugee come down!</t5713><t5714>"</t5714>
<t5715>Just as he was about to dismount from the saddle, he decided that for now the saddle was the safest place and gave up dismounting, saying, "Here is the refugee in front of you, friends!</t5715> <t5716>Didn't I come to France of my own free will?" he said.</t5716>
<t5717>With a hammer in his hand, "You are a damned refugee," a blacksmith shouted angrily from within the crowd; "and also a damned aristocrat!"</t5717>
<t5718>The postmaster, stepping in between this man and the rider's saddle (clearly he was making these at the time), said in a calming manner, "Let it go, let it go! He will be judged in Paris anyway."</t5718>
<t5719>"He will be judged, of course!" repeated the blacksmith, waving his hammer.</t5719> <t5720>"Of course!</t5720> <t5721>He will be convicted as a traitor."</t5721> <t5722>Upon this, the crowd approved with a loud murmur.</t5722>
<t5723>Darnay, turning his horse's head towards the courtyard, said to the postmaster (while the drunken patriot, with a rope wrapped around his wrist, sat calmly in his saddle, observing the surroundings) at the first moment he could make himself heard:</t5723>
<t5724>"Friends, either you are deceiving yourselves or someone is deceiving you.</t5724> <t5725>I am not a traitor.</t5725><t5726>"</t5726>
<t5727>"He's lying!" shouted the blacksmith.</t5727> <t5728>"Since that new law was passed, he's been a traitor.</t5728> <t5729>His life is in the hands of the people.</t5729> <t5730>His damn life is no longer his own!</t5730><t5731>"</t5731>
<t5732>As soon as Darnay saw the aggressive urgency in the eyes of the crowd, he understood that it would be directed at him; at that moment, the postmaster turned Darnay's horse towards the courtyard, the escorts immediately closed in on the horse, and the postmaster tightly shut the doors.</t5732> <t5733>When the blacksmith struck the door hard with his hammer, the crowd murmured, but nothing else happened.</t5733>
<t5734>After thanking the postmaster, while they were standing in the courtyard, Darnay asked, "Which law was the blacksmith talking about?"</t5734>
<t5735>"A law regarding the sale of refugees' properties.</t5735><t5736>"</t5736>
<t5737>"When did it come out?</t5737><t5738>"</t5738>
<t5739>"On the fourteenth."</t5739><t5740>"</t5740>
<t5741>"The day I left England!"</t5741><t5742>"</t5742>
<t5743>"According to what they said, this was just one of them; even if not now, other laws will be enacted later to get rid of the refugees and to prosecute those who return.</t5743> <t5744>When he said that life depended on us, this is what he meant.</t5744><t5745>"</t5745>
<t5746>"But these laws haven't come out yet!"</t5746><t5747>"</t5747>
<t5748>"I don't know," said the postmaster, shrugging his shoulders; "maybe it has been sent out or maybe it will be sent out.</t5748> <t5749>It's all the same in the end.</t5749> <t5750>What difference does it make?</t5750><t5751>"</t5751>
<t5752>They rested on the hay in an attic until midnight and set out again when the whole town was asleep.</t5752> <t5753>One of the things that made this mad journey surreal and one of the biggest changes they observed was that everyone was now sleeping less.</t5753> <t5754>After traveling for a long time on gloomy and deserted roads, they would reach clusters of poor cottages, far from the darkness, with their lamps shining brightly, and here they would encounter people wandering around like ghosts in the dead of night, circling hand in hand around the shriveled tree of liberty, or standing tall together singing songs of freedom.</t5754> <t5755>But fortunately, Beauvais was asleep that night, so things went well for them, and they once again merged into solitude and desolation; sometimes passing through barren fields that had not yielded crops that year and were varied with the black remnants of burned houses, accompanied by the untimely cold and rain, and sometimes pulling on the reins in front of patriotic patrols who suddenly appeared from their hiding places, ambushing all the roads.</t5755>
<t5756>Daylight finally caught them at the gates of Paris.</t5756> <t5757>The barrier was closed, and as they moved in that direction, there was no getting past the guard.</t5757>
<t5758>The stern-looking official called outside by the guard asked, "Where are the prisoner's papers?"</t5758>
<t5759>Charles Darnay, who was naturally disturbed by this unpleasant word, explained to this person that he was a free traveler and a French citizen, and that he had hired his companions due to the country's chaotic situation.</t5759>
<t5760>The same person, without paying attention to what he heard, asked again, "Where are the prisoner's papers?"</t5760>
<t5761>The drunken companion took out the papers from inside his hat and handed them over.</t5761> <t5762>The official who glanced at Gabelle's letter, confused and astonished, scrutinized Darnay with great attention.</t5762>
<t5763>Without saying a single word, the man left them and entered the police station alone; meanwhile, Darnay and his companions waited in front of the door, on their horses.</t5763> <t5764>During this tense wait, Charles Darnay looked around and saw that the entrance was held by soldiers and patriotic citizens, the number of citizens was greater than that of the soldiers, and while it was easy for peasants and similar types bringing supplies with carts to enter the city, exiting was very difficult even for the most ordinary citizen.</t5764> <t5765>Men and women of all kinds, a multitude of animals, and various types of vehicles were waiting to exit; but the previous identity check was so strict that they had progressed very slowly from the barrier.</t5765> <t5766>While some, seeing that they had a long wait ahead, lay down to sleep or smoke tobacco, others chatted with each other or loitered around.</t5766> <t5767>The red cap and the tricolor rosette were very popular among both women and men.</t5767>
<t5768>Darnay, who had been sitting on his horse's saddle for about half an hour observing the surroundings, found the same official in front of him again, the man was telling the guards to open the barrier.</t5768> <t5769>Then, one drunk and the other sober, the escorts gave a receipt for the person they were accompanying and asked Darnay to dismount.</t5769> <t5770>Darnay did as he was told, and the two citizens took his tired horse with them and returned the way they had come without entering the city.</t5770>
<t5771>Darnay, along with the official, went to the police station, which reeked of cheap wine and tobacco, where some soldiers and citizens were sleeping and waking, sitting or lying down, transitioning between sleep and wakefulness, and between drunkenness and sobriety.</t5771> <t5772>The light, partly from the gas lamp left on overnight and partly from the enclosed atmosphere, reflected an equally ambiguous situation.</t5772> <t5773>Some record books were open on one of the tables, and a rough-looking, sullen clerk was bent over them.</t5773>
<t5774>Taking a paper to write something about the man, "Citizen Defarge," said the official who brought Darnay.</t5774> <t5775>"Is this the refugee Evremonde?"</t5775><t5776>"</t5776>
<t5777>"Yes, it's him.</t5777><t5778>"</t5778>
<t5779>"How old are you, Evremonde?"</t5779>
<t5780>"Thirty-seven.</t5780><t5781>"</t5781>
<t5782>"Are you married, Evremonde?</t5782><t5783>"</t5783>
<t5784>"Yes.</t5784><t5785>"</t5785>
<t5786>"Where is your house?"</t5786>
<t5787>"In England.</t5787><t5788>"</t5788>
<t5789>"Without a doubt.</t5789> <t5790>Where is your wife, Evremonde?"</t5790>
<t5791>"In England.</t5791><t5792>"</t5792>
<t5793>"No doubt.</t5793> <t5794>You have been sent to La Force Prison, Evremonde.</t5794><t5795>"</t5795>
<t5796>"My God, how is this possible!" cried Darnay.</t5796> <t5797>"According to which law, for what crime?</t5797><t5798>"</t5798>
<t5799>The attendant lifted his head from the paper he was filling out and looked up for a moment.</t5799>
<t5800>"Since you left here, we have new laws, Evremonde, and of course, new crimes."</t5800> <t5801>As he said this, there was a rough smile on his face, and he continued writing.</t5801>
<t5802>"I would like to state that I have come here of my own accord to help the citizen whose request is written on the paper in front of you.</t5802> <t5803>I hope you will give me this opportunity without delay.</t5803> <t5804>Do I not have this right?" The official replied emotionlessly, "Refugees have no rights, Evremonde!"</t5804> <t5805>He finished his writing, read it once more to himself, then sealed it and handed it to Defarge, saying "Secret."</t5805>
<t5806>Defarge signaled the prisoner to come with the paper in his hand.</t5806> <t5807>The prisoner complied, and two armed patriotic citizens joined them.</t5807> <t5808>As they descended the steps of the station and headed towards Paris, Defarge asked Darnay in a low voice, "Are you the one who married the daughter of Doctor Manette, who once lay in the Bastille?"</t5808>
<t5809>"Yes!" replied Darnay, looking at her in astonishment.</t5809>
<t5810>"My name is Defarge and I have a wine shop in St Antoine Square.</t5810> <t5811>You have probably heard of me before.</t5811><t5812>"</t5812>
<t5813>"My wife had come to your house to pick up her father, right?"</t5813> <t5814>"Of course!"</t5814>
<t5815>When Defarge heard the word "wife," he suddenly became tense and impatiently asked, "For the love of the newly born stern lady Guillotine, answer; why did you come to France?"</t5815>
<t5816>"You just heard why I came.</t5816> <t5817>Don't you believe what I said is true?</t5817><t5818>"</t5818>
<t5819>"A fact to your detriment," said Defarge, looking straight ahead with furrowed brows.</t5819>
<t5820>"I was taken aback here.</t5820> <t5821>Everything has changed so unexpectedly, mercilessly, and quickly that I was taken aback.</t5821> <t5822>Can't you help me a little?</t5822><t5823>"</t5823>
<t5824>"No."</t5824> <t5825>Defarge was speaking while looking straight ahead.</t5825>
<t5826>"If I ask you something, can you answer?</t5826><t5827>"</t5827>
<t5828>"It could be.</t5828> <t5829>It depends on the question you're going to ask.</t5829> <t5830>What is the matter?</t5830><t5831>"</t5831>
<t5832>"In this prison where I have been so unjustly taken, will I be able to communicate freely with the outside?"</t5832><t5833>"</t5833>
<t5834>"You will see.</t5834><t5835>"</t5835>
<t5836>"I won't be locked up there without a trial or a chance to explain my situation, will I?</t5836><t5837>"</t5837>
<t5838>"You will see.</t5838> <t5839>But then what will happen?</t5839> <t5840>Many people in similar situations before you were imprisoned in much worse dungeons.</t5840><t5841>"</t5841>
<t5842>"But such a thing wouldn't happen to me, right Citizen Defarge?</t5842><t5843>"</t5843>
<t5844>Defarge looked at him mysteriously as if he were about to say something, and then sank into a long and stern silence.</t5844> <t5845>As the silence prolonged, the possibility of the man softening was diminishing – or so Darnay thought.</t5845> <t5846>Therefore, he hastily said:</t5846>
<t5847>"Considering the fact that I will be confined to La Force Prison, it is extremely important for me to be able to speak with the English gentleman Mr. Lorry, who works at Tellson's Bank and is currently in Paris.</t5847> <t5848>Can you arrange this for me?</t5848><t5849>"</t5849>
<t5850>"For you," said Defarge and continued resolutely, "there is nothing I can do.</t5850> <t5851>My obligation is to my country and my people.</t5851> <t5852>I am their sworn servant against you.</t5852> <t5853>I can do nothing for you.</t5853><t5854>"</t5854>
<t5855>Darnay felt that there was no point in pleading any further, moreover, his pride was hurt.</t5855> <t5856>As he proceeded in silence, he saw how familiar the public was with prisoners passing by.</t5856> <t5857>Except for a few children, no one noticed him.</t5857> <t5858>Two or three passersby turned their heads to look, and a few, thinking he was an aristocrat, pointed their fingers and shook them; after all, a well-dressed man being taken to prison had become as normal as a worker going to his job in his work clothes.</t5858> <t5859>In a narrow, dark, and dirty street they passed, an excited speaker standing on a stool was telling an enthusiastic crowd about the crimes the king and the royal family had committed against the people.</t5859> <t5860>As far as Charles Darnay could catch from this man's lips, the king was in prison and all the foreign ambassadors had left Paris.</t5860> <t5861>He had heard nothing on the road (except outside Beauvais).</t5861> <t5862>His escorts and his great anxiety must have isolated him from everything.</t5862>
<t5863>He knew now that he was in much greater dangers than those he was in when he left England.</t5863> <t5864>He also knew now that the threat was rapidly increasing and would continue to increase.</t5864> <t5865>If he had known what he would experience in the last few days, he might never have embarked on this journey.</t5865> <t5866>Still, his anxieties were not as dark as they seemed; there was a faint light, it seemed.</t5866> <t5867>The future was as uncertain as it was troubled, and within all this uncertainty, there was an ignorant hope.</t5867> <t5868>The massacre that would begin in a few hours and last for days and nights would stain the sacred harvest time with blood, but to Darnay, it felt like something that would happen a hundred thousand years later.</t5868> <t5869>"The newly born harsh lady guillotine" was not yet well-known by name.</t5869> <t5870>The terrible actions that would soon take place perhaps had not yet formed in the minds of those who would carry them out.</t5870> <t5871>How could all these fit into the vague concepts within a polite mind?</t5871>
<t5872>While cruelly separated from his wife and child, he could foresee the unjust treatment he would endure in custody and the difficulties he would face, he was even certain of it; but beyond that, there was nothing specific he feared.</t5872> <t5873>His mind filled with these thoughts, enough to fill a gloomy prison courtyard, they arrived at La Force Prison.</t5873>
<t5874>A man with a swollen face opened the heavy door, and Defarge introduced Darnay by saying, "Refugee Evremonde."</t5874>
<t5875>"May God punish them!</t5875> <t5876>Will they never end?" shouted the fat-faced man.</t5876>
<t5877>Defarge took the receipt without paying attention to the man's shouting and returned with his two guards.</t5877>
<t5878>The guard who remained with his wife shouted again, "May God punish them!"</t5878> <t5879>"Will these never end?</t5879><t5880>"</t5880>
<t5881>His wife, who had no answer to this question, simply said, "You need to be patient, dear!"</t5881> <t5882>The three guards who came upon hearing the woman's bell were of the same opinion, and one of them, although it wasn't quite appropriate for the situation, added, "For the love of freedom!"</t5882>
<t5883>The dark and filthy La Force Prison was a gloomy prison, and inside there was a disgusting smell caused by heavy sleep.</t5883> <t5884>How quickly the disgusting smell of sleep, which was not properly attended to, would permeate such places where detainees were held!</t5884>
<t5885>The guard grumbled, looking at the paper, "And it's supposed to be secret!"</t5885> <t5886>"I'm already looking for a reason to explode!</t5886><t5887>"</t5887>
<t5888>Adam grumpily put the paper into a file, and Charles Darnay waited for about half an hour for him to regain his mood; sometimes walking up and down in the room filled with sharp belts, sometimes resting on a heavy stone; in any case, he was etched into the memory of the man standing over him and those beside him.</t5888>
<t5889>"Come!" called the guard at the head, while taking out his key, "come with me, refugee.</t5889><t5890>"</t5890>
<t5891>In the gloomy dim light of the prison, they walked through corridors and stairs accompanied by the new warden, many doors opened and locked behind them, and finally, they arrived at a large, low-ceilinged, domed hall filled with a multitude of inmates, both men and women.</t5891> <t5892>The women were seated at the head of a long table, some reading and writing, some knitting, and some sewing and embroidering; many of the men were either leaning back in their chairs or wandering up and down the hall.</t5892>
<t5893>The newly arrived prisoner instinctively recoiled and stepped back upon seeing the inmates he associated with disgraceful crimes and scandals.</t5893> <t5894>But the most surreal part of this long and unreal journey was that they all stood up at that moment to greet him with the most polite manners of the time and all the elegance and grace that beautify life.</t5894>
<t5895>The style and gloom of the prison had so strangely overshadowed these subtleties, and the prisoners had fallen into such bizarre states, resembling ghosts amidst all this inappropriate filth and misery, that Charles Darnay felt as if he were among a community of the dead.</t5895> <t5896>They all seemed like ghosts!</t5896> <t5897>The ghost of beauty, the ghost of splendor, the ghost of grace, the ghost of pride, the ghost of frivolity, the ghost of intelligence, the ghosts of youth and old age, all were waiting for the day they would escape from this desolate shore, and all had turned their dead eyes, which had died upon entering the prison, towards him.</t5897>
<t5898>Charles Darnay was frozen in place at the sight.</t5898> <t5899>The guard was beside him, others were wandering around, and although they appeared normal with their usual busyness, they stood so crudely next to the sorrowful mothers and young girls in the prime of their lives – all those fancy women, beautiful young women, and well-mannered mature women ghosts – that the contrast created by every kind of experience and possibility represented by these silhouettes was at its extremes.</t5899> <t5900>They must all have been ghosts.</t5900> <t5901>At the end of this long, surreal, and afflicted road, these gloomy figures had appeared before him!</t5901>
<t5902>A distinguished-looking gentleman approached and said, "On behalf of this unfortunate community, I am honored to welcome you to La Force and to share in whatever misfortune has brought you among us.</t5902> <t5903>We hope that your sufferings will come to an end as soon as possible.</t5903> <t5904>In any other place, it would certainly be inappropriate to ask, but given the circumstances here, may we know your name and situation?</t5904><t5905>"</t5905>
<t5906>Charles Darnay composed himself and introduced himself with the most appropriate words he could find.</t5906>
<t5907>"But I hope," said the polite gentleman, watching the chief warden roaming the room with his eyes, "you are not one of the secret ones."</t5907><t5908>"</t5908>
<t5909>"I don't know what this statement means, but I heard them say it like this."</t5909><t5910>"</t5910>
<t5911>"Ah, what a pity!"</t5911> <t5912>"We are very sorry about this!"</t5912> <t5913>"But don't lose your courage; many people here were secretive when they first arrived, but this situation didn't last long."</t5913> <t5914>Then, raising his voice, he added, "I'm sorry to say this, but – it was secretive."</t5914><t5915>"</t5915>
<t5916>As Charles Darnay crossed the room and advanced towards the barred door where the guard awaited him, murmurs of compassion rose from the crowd, many of which – the most distinct being from women with soft and affectionate voices – encouraged him with well-wishes.</t5916> <t5917>When Darnay reached the barred door, he turned to offer them his thanks; the guard closed the iron door, and the phantoms vanished from his sight forever.</t5917>
<t5918>The door opened to a stone staircase leading upwards.</t5918> <t5919>After climbing forty steps together (the half-hour prisoner had counted each step), the guard opened a low black door and they entered an empty cell.</t5919> <t5920>It was cold and damp but not dark.</t5920>
<t5921>"This is yours," said the guard.</t5921>
<t5922>"Why are they keeping me alone?</t5922><t5923>"</t5923>
<t5924>"How should I know?"</t5924><t5925>"</t5925>
<t5926>"Can I get a pen, ink, and paper?</t5926><t5927>"</t5927>
<t5928>"I was not given such an order.</t5928> <t5929>You can ask when they come to see you.</t5929> <t5930>For now, you can only get food.</t5930><t5931>"</t5931>
<t5932>There was a table, a chair, and a straw-filled mattress in the cell.</t5932> <t5933>Before the guard left, while inspecting these items and the walls of the cell, a flood of thoughts passed through Darnay's distracted mind as he leaned against the wall directly opposite the guard; the guard's face and body were so unhealthily swollen that he looked like a drowned man filled with water.</t5933> <t5934>When the guard left, in the same distraction, he thought, "I have been abandoned as if I were dead."</t5934> <t5935>Then he stopped and looked at the mattress, turned his head away in disgust, and thought, "and the first thing my body encountered after death were the creatures crawling over there."</t5935>
<t5936>"Five and a half steps, five and a half steps, five and a half steps."</t5936> <t5937>The prisoner was pacing up and down in the cell, measuring the room, and the city's hum, mixed with the maddening sounds, was increasing like the muffled sounds of drums.</t5937> <t5938>"Those shoes would do, those shoes would do, those shoes would do."</t5938> <t5939>The prisoner measured the room again and, as if trying to keep his mind away from these words, took his steps faster this time.</t5939> <t5940>"The ghosts that disappear when the door closes.</t5940> <t5941>Among them was one, a woman in a black dress leaning against the window sill with golden hair illuminated by the light, as if a...</t5941> <t5942>For God's sake, let's keep going, let's pass through the bright villages where everyone is awake!..</t5942> <t5943>Those shoes would do, shoes would do, shoes would do...</t5943> <t5944>Five and a half steps."</t5944> <t5945>With these thoughts coming from the deepest parts of his mind and struggling, the prisoner kept counting his steps faster and faster; the city's hum also kept increasing in the same way –the well-known screams accompanying the muffled drum sounds were relentless.</t5945>
<t5946>II</t5946>
<t5947>Whetstone</t5947>
<t5948>Tellson Bank in the Saint Germain area of Paris was located in a wing of a large building separated from the street by a high wall and a sturdy gate, with a courtyard in front of it.</t5948> <t5949>The building belonged to a significant nobleman who, when troubles arose, donned his cook's attire, greased his heels, and successfully crossed the border.</t5949> <t5950>This cunning individual, who managed to escape from the hunters and whose soul migration had yet to occur, was none other than the Monsignor who once needed three strong men in addition to his cook to bring his cocoa to his lips.</t5950>
<t5951>The Monsignor had fled, and the three powerful men who sinned while drawing high salaries from him had exonerated themselves at the altar of the newborn "Republic One and Indivisible.</t5951> <t5952>Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death," eager and impatient to slit his throat, had seized the Monsignor's house and confiscated all his property.</t5952> <t5953>Events were progressing so rapidly, and laws were being passed in such a frenzied rush one after another, that by the third night of September, the patriotic representatives of the laws had taken over the Monsignor's house, painted everything in three colors, and were drinking brandy in his rooms.</t5953> <t5954>If Tellson's London branch had been no different from its Paris branch, it would soon have driven the manager insane and caused the bank's bankruptcy.</t5954> <t5955>Who knows what the dignified and respectable Englishmen, symbols of sobriety and respectability, would say when they saw the orange trees planted in wooden boxes in the bank's courtyard and Cupid behind the counter?</t5955> <t5956>But such things were happening.</t5956> <t5957>Although Tellson had plastered over Cupid, he could still be seen on the ceiling in his light attire, aiming at money from morning till night, as he often did.</t5957> <t5958>This young pagan must have inevitably brought bankruptcy to London, to Lombard Street, and of course, the partitioned area behind this immortal child, the mirror set into the wall, and the not-so-old clerks who would come out and dance among the people at the slightest provocation.</t5958> <t5959>Tellson in France could handle such things quite well, and as long as things were going smoothly, no one had been frightened enough to withdraw their money.</t5959>
<t5960>From now on, what money would be withdrawn from Tellson's and what money would lie there, lost and forgotten; while their owners rotted in prisons and were violently punished and destroyed, what gold and jewels would tarnish in Tellson's vaults; how many accounts at Tellson's would remain open in this world and be left to be settled in the next; that night, there was no one who could answer these questions, immersed in deep thoughts, other than Mr. Jarvis Lorry.</t5960> <t5961>The honest and brave face of Mr. Lorry, sitting by the newly lit fireplace (amidst all the chaos and scarcity, winter had also come early), was covered by a shadow deeper than anything the hanging lamp or anything else in the room could reflect – the shadow of terror.</t5961>
<t5962>Mr. Lorry, like a well-rooted ivy, was staying in one of the rooms at the bank due to his long-standing loyalty to the company he had served for years.</t5962> <t5963>In this way, they were providing a kind of security against the patriotic occupation of the main building; but the kind-hearted old gentleman never gave it a thought.</t5963> <t5964>He minded his own business and never concerned himself with such matters.</t5964> <t5965>At the bottom of the courtyard, under the columns, there was a wide area for carriages – even the carriages of Monseigneur were parked there.</t5965> <t5966>On two of the columns, there were lanterns with flickering flames, and outside, in their light, a large grindstone was noticeable: it seemed to have been hastily brought from a nearby blacksmith or another workshop and roughly placed there.</t5966> <t5967>Standing up and looking out the window at these harmless things, Mr. Lorry shivered and returned to his chair by the fireplace.</t5967> <t5968>He had opened not only the window but also the latticed shutter outside; he closed both again and shivered as he sat down once more.</t5968>
<t5969>The usual nighttime hum of the city was coming from the streets behind the high wall and the large gate, occasionally accompanied by an indescribable ringing; it was strange and hair-raising, as if the unusual sounds of a dreadful nature were rising to the sky.</t5969>
<t5970>"Thank God," said Mr. Lorry, clasping his hands, "no one close to me, no one I love, is in this terrible city tonight.</t5970> <t5971>May God protect everyone who is in danger!</t5971><t5972>"</t5972>
<t5973>Soon after, the big doorbell rang and Mr. Lorry, thinking "They have come!" perked up his ears from where he was sitting.</t5973> <t5974>However, there was no grand invasion in the courtyard as he had imagined; then he heard the thud of the door again and the place fell into silence.</t5974>
<t5975>Mr. Lorry's inner unease and fear had revealed his vague anxiety about the bank, but it was natural for such a great change to evoke this feeling when his emotions were so heightened.</t5975> <t5976>The bank was well protected, and just as Mr. Lorry stood up to go to the reliable men guarding it, the door suddenly opened, and he stepped back in great astonishment upon seeing two people burst in.</t5976>
<t5977>It was Lucie and her father who had arrived!</t5977> <t5978>Lucie was coming towards him with her arms open, bearing that old intense and severe seriousness on her face as if it were sealed there to give him strength and power in this period of his life.</t5978>
<t5979>"What happened?" shouted Mr. Lorry, breathless and confused.</t5979> <t5980>"What's going on?</t5980> <t5981>Lucie! Manette! Has something happened?</t5981> <t5982>What brought you here?</t5982> <t5983>What happened?</t5983><t5984>"</t5984>
<t5985>With her pale face and all her anxiety, Lucie, who was embraced by Mr. Lorry, fixed her gaze on Mr. Lorry and, in a breathless, pleading voice, said, "Oh my dear life companion!</t5985> <t5986>My husband!" she moaned.</t5986>
<t5987>"Your husband, Lucie?"</t5987>
<t5988>"Charles.</t5988><t5989>"</t5989>
<t5990>"What happened to Charles?</t5990><t5991>"</t5991>
<t5992>"He's here!"</t5992>
<t5993>"In Paris?"</t5993><t5994>"</t5994>
<t5995>"He has been here for a while –three or four days –I don't know exactly how many days– I can't gather my thoughts.</t5995> <t5996>For some unknown reason, he seems to have come to help someone; then he was stopped at the city entrance and thrown into prison.</t5996><t5997>"</t5997>
<t5998>The old man couldn't hold himself back and let out a scream.</t5998> <t5999>Almost at the same time, the big doorbell rang again and a crowd of people rushed into the courtyard with shouts and commotion.</t5999>
<t6000>"What is that noise?" said the Doctor, turning to the window.</t6000>
<t6001>"Don't look!" shouted Mr. Lorry.</t6001> <t6002>"Don't look outside!</t6002> <t6003>Manette, for the love of your life, don't touch the shutter!</t6003><t6004>"</t6004>
<t6005>The doctor, with his hand on the window handle, turned and said with a bold smile:</t6005>
<t6006>"My dear friend, I have a good life in this city.</t6006> <t6007>I am a man who has served time in the Bastille Prison.</t6007> <t6008>In Paris – is it just Paris? There is no patriot in all of France who, knowing I was imprisoned in the Bastille, would not embrace me and hold me in high regard.</t6008> <t6009>My old pain gave me such strength that we were able to cross that barricade and get inside, and thanks to this, we learned about Charles's situation and were able to come here.</t6009> <t6010>I knew it would be like this; I knew I could save Charles from all dangers; I even told Lucie.</t6010> <t6011>–What is that noise?" His hand had gone to the window again.</t6011>
<t6012>"Don't look!" shouted Mr. Lorry, having completely lost hope.</t6012> <t6013>"No Lucie, you don't look either, my dear!" He pulled Lucie back, wrapping his arms around her.</t6013> <t6014>"Don't be afraid, my child!</t6014> <t6015>I swear that nothing has happened to Charles; I even doubt that he is in this dreadful place.</t6015> <t6016>Which prison have they taken him to?</t6016><t6017>"</t6017>
<t6018>"The Force!"</t6018>
<t6019>"The Force? Lucie my dear, if you have been brave and skillful in your life – which you always have been – now you must pull yourself together and do exactly what I tell you; because everything depends on this and neither can I explain it nor can you guess it.</t6019> <t6020>There is nothing you can do for him tonight; you must absolutely not move from your place.</t6020> <t6021>I am saying this because what I want you to do for Charles is the hardest part.</t6021> <t6022>You must calm down as soon as possible, listen to us and stay quiet, let me place you in one of the back rooms.</t6022> <t6023>Leave your father and me alone for a few minutes, you know this is a matter of life and death, it cannot be delayed.</t6023><t6024>"</t6024>
<t6025>"I will do whatever you say.</t6025> <t6026>It seems you understand that I can't do anything else for you.</t6026> <t6027>If you say so, then it is so.</t6027><t6028>"</t6028>
<t6029>The old man hurriedly took Lucie to her room, kissed her, and locked the door behind her; then he hurried back to the Doctor, opened the window, drew the shutters, placed his hand on the Doctor's arm, and they looked out into the courtyard together.</t6029>
<t6030>Below, there was a commotion involving both men and women, but their numbers were not enough to fill the courtyard; there were at most forty or fifty people.</t6030> <t6031>The owners of the building had opened the door for them, and they had rushed straight to the whetstone to get to work; apparently, they had placed it in a suitable and quiet corner for their own purposes.</t6031>
<t6032>But the workers and their jobs were so terrible!</t6032>
<t6033>The grindstone had two handles, and the faces of the two men who were wildly turning them rose with each turn of the grindstone, causing their long hair to fly in the air, and in this state, they looked more terrifying and cruel than the faces of the most frenzied and savage barbarians.</t6033> <t6034>The faces to which the false eyebrows and mustaches were attached were drenched in sweat and blood, and under the influence of all that howling, they were all convulsed; their eyes sparkled with a mad excitement and sleeplessness.</t6034> <t6035>As the men kept turning with all their brutality, their matted hair fell in front of their eyes, and they constantly threw it back, while some of the women held wine to their mouths in case they wanted it; with the effect of the flowing wine, blood, and sparks from the stone, the ominous atmosphere that surrounded everything had coagulated and ignited.</t6035> <t6036>There was not a single person whose face was not smeared with blood.</t6036> <t6037>Half-naked men were trying to reach the grindstone by shouldering each other; their hands and arms were stained all over; their clothes, resembling rags, were stained all over; they were men loaded with lacy, silky, and ribboned spoils they had collected from women, which were finely stained with blood.</t6037> <t6038>They had brought a lot of small axes, knives, bayonets, and swords to make them sharper, and they were all covered in blood.</t6038> <t6039>Some of these sharp swords were tied to the wrists of those carrying them with linen strips and scraps of clothing.</t6039> <t6040>Although the things they tied varied, they were all shades of a single color.</t6040> <t6041>As the frenzied carriers of these weapons took them from the sparks and carried them to the streets, the same red had covered their mad eyes; the eyes looked so crazed that anyone who had not turned cruel would give twenty years of their life for the weapon aimed at them to freeze in place.</t6041>
<t6042>Just as a drowning man or someone swiftly passing to the other world can see the world in that final moment, what happened in the courtyard occurred in just such a moment.</t6042> <t6043>They withdrew from the window, and the Doctor looked at his friend's ashen face, waiting for an explanation.</t6043>
<t6044>"They are," said Mr. Lorry in a whispering voice, looking at the locked room with eyes full of fear, "killing the prisoners.</t6044> <t6045>If you are sure of what you just said; if you truly possess the power you think you do – and I believe you do – introduce yourself to these devils and go to La Force.</t6045> <t6046>Maybe it is already too late, I don't know, but we must not waste any time!</t6046><t6047>"</t6047>
<t6048>Dr. Manette, after shaking his friend's hand, quickly went outside without taking his hat, and by the time Mr. Lorry turned back to the window, he had already reached the courtyard.</t6048>
<t6049>His flowing white hair, striking face, and the hurried confidence in his demeanor carried him through the weapons as if parting water, bringing him instantly to the very center of the crowd.</t6049> <t6050>After a few minutes of silence, there was some movement, murmurs; then his incomprehensible voice was heard and at that moment Mr. Lorry saw the Doctor.</t6050> <t6051>He was surrounded; standing in the midst of twenty men, shoulder to shoulder, hands on each other's shoulders, shouting in agitation.</t6051> <t6052>"Long live the prisoners of the Bastille!</t6052> <t6053>Let's help the prisoner in La Force who is a relative of those in the Bastille!</t6053> <t6054>Make way for the Bastille prisoner in the front lines!</t6054> <t6055>Let's save Evremonde, the prisoner in La Force!" and thousands responded.</t6055>
<t6056>Mr. Lorry, his heart fluttering, closed the cage again, shut the window and the curtains, and hurriedly went to Lucie, telling her that her father had gone with others to look for her husband.</t6056> <t6057>He found Lucie with her child and Miss Pross; but for a long time, that is, until he sat down and watched them in the silence of the night, it did not even occur to him to be surprised that they were there.</t6057>
<t6058>At that moment, Lucie, in a state of unconsciousness, was sitting on the ground by Mr. Lorry's knee, holding tightly to his hand.</t6058> <t6059>Miss Pross had laid the child on Mr. Lorry's bed, and before long, her own head had fallen onto the pillow right next to her sweet responsibility.</t6059> <t6060>The night, oh what a long night it was, accompanied by the poor woman's moans!</t6060> <t6061>Oh, throughout that long, very long night, neither had her father returned home, nor had any news arrived!</t6061>
<t6062>In the darkness, the bell of the large door rang twice more and people poured in again in droves, and the grindstone spun furiously, scattering sparks.</t6062> <t6063>"What is this?" cried Lucie, in horror.</t6063> <t6064>"Stay calm!</t6064> <t6065>The soldiers' swords are being sharpened there!" said Mr. Lorry.</t6065> <t6066>"This place now belongs to the people, my dear, and is being used as a sort of armory.</t6066><t6067>"</t6067>
<t6068>The number of those who came this time was twice that of the previous ones; but by the end of this last mission, they had begun to weaken.</t6068> <t6069>Soon after, as dawn began to break, Mr. Lorry gently separated his hand from the one clinging to him and cautiously looked out the window.</t6069> <t6070>Standing on the pavement where the grindstone was, a man with a blank expression looked around; his clothes were so dirty that he resembled a wounded soldier crawling back to consciousness from a massacre site.</t6070> <t6071>The exhausted villain soon noticed one of Monseigneur's carriages in the dim light, staggered towards the magnificent carriage, climbed the steps, and closed the door to rest on the elegant cushions.</t6071>
<t6072>When Mr. Lorry looked out the window again, the great grindstone called the world was turning, and the sun was painting the courtyard red.</t6072> <t6073>But the smaller grindstone, in the morning coolness, stood alone with a redness that the sun never gave and would never take back.</t6073>
<t6074>III</t6074>
<t6075>Shadow</t6075>
<t6076>When the working hour arrived, the first thought that occupied Mr. Lorry's work-focused mind was this: Did he have the right to endanger Tellson's by sheltering the wife of a refugee prisoner under the bank's roof?</t6076> <t6077>For Lucie and her child, he would unhesitatingly give all his property, even his life, but this great responsibility was not something that belonged solely to him, and when it came to work, he was a serious businessman.</t6077>
<t6078>At first, he thought of Defarge and considered finding the wine shop again to get advice from the owner on where the safest place in this wayward city might be.</t6078> <t6079>But then he gave up on this idea; Defarge lived in the most dreadful area and was certainly an influential person there; he might even be at the forefront of these dangerous affairs.</t6079>
<t6080>Noon was approaching, the Doctor still hadn't returned, and with each passing minute, he was putting Tellson in a bit more danger.</t6080> <t6081>Mr. Lorry had had a tête-à-tête with Lucie.</t6081> <t6082>Lucie mentioned that her father had talked about renting a house in that area, near the bank, for a short period.</t6082> <t6083>From a business perspective, it wasn't a matter to object to, and as far as he could see, even if everything went well for Charles and he was released, there was no hope of leaving the city immediately; Mr. Lorry went out to find a house for them and found a suitable place in a gloomy building in a secluded side street on the hills, where the closed shutters indicated that no one was living inside.</t6083>
<t6084>He first placed Lucie, her daughter, and Miss Pross in this small place; he tried to make them as comfortable as possible, even giving them comforts that he himself did not have.</t6084> <t6085>He placed Jerry, with his door-sized bulk and thick head capable of withstanding any blow, next to them and returned to his work.</t6085> <t6086>But he was always uneasy and unhappy inside, and thus the day slowly, gradually came to an end.</t6086>
<t6087>When the day ended and the bank closed, Mr. Lorry was also exhausted.</t6087> <t6088>When he heard a footstep on the stairs, he was alone in his room again, just like the previous night, thinking about what to do next.</t6088> <t6089>Soon, a man appeared before him and, after scrutinizing him intently, addressed him by name.</t6089>
<t6090>"Please," said Mr. Lorry.</t6090> <t6091>"Do you recognize me?</t6091><t6092>"</t6092>
<t6093>He was a man with curly black hair, around forty-five to fifty years old, with a strong appearance.</t6093> <t6094>Without changing the emphasis, he repeated Mr. Lorry's words:</t6094>
<t6095>"Do you know me?</t6095><t6096>"</t6096>
<t6097>"I think we have met before.</t6097><t6098>"</t6098>
<t6099>"Maybe we had met at my wine shop.</t6099><t6100>"</t6100>
<t6101>Mr. Lorry, both concerned and anxious, then said: "Are you coming from Dr. Manette's side?</t6101><t6102>"</t6102>
<t6103>"Yes, I am coming from Doctor Manette's side."</t6103><t6104>"</t6104>
<t6105>"What does he say?</t6105> <t6106>What message did he send me?</t6106><t6107>"</t6107>
<t6108>Defarge handed a piece of paper to the worried Mr. Lorry.</t6108> <t6109>On the paper, in the Doctor's handwriting, the following was written:</t6109>
<t6110>Charles is safe, but I still cannot leave here safely.</t6110> <t6111>I asked the person bringing you this note to allow Charles to send a small note to his wife as well.</t6111> <t6112>Please arrange for this person to meet with Lucie.</t6112>
<t6113>The note had been written an hour ago at La Force.</t6113> <t6114>After reading the note aloud, Mr. Lorry relaxed and asked in a cheerful voice, "Would you accompany me to where his wife lives?"</t6114>
<t6115>"Thank you," replied Defarge.</t6115>
<t6116>Mr. Lorry, who had not quite noticed how quietly and mechanically Defarge spoke, put on his hat and they went down to the courtyard together.</t6116> <t6117>There were two women standing there; one of them was knitting.</t6117>
<t6118>Mr. Lorry, who had left her exactly like this seventeen years ago, said, "Madame Defarge, of course!"</t6118>
<t6119>"Yes, that's him," said her husband.</t6119>
<t6120>When he saw the woman start walking with them, Mr. Lorry asked, "Is the lady going to come with us too?"</t6120>
<t6121>"Yes.</t6121> <t6122>It can recognize faces and identify people this way.</t6122> <t6123>This is necessary for their safety.</t6123><t6124>"</t6124>
<t6125>Mr. Lorry, who was starting to be disturbed by Defarge's demeanor, looked suspiciously and continued walking.</t6125> <t6126>Two women were following them; the second woman was Vengeance.</t6126>
<t6127>They hurried through the streets as quickly as possible, climbed the steps of the new house, were greeted by Jerry, and upon entering, found Lucie sobbing alone. The young woman, revived by the news brought by Mr. Lorry from her husband, tightly grasped the hand that delivered the note – a hand that had no idea what it had done near her husband that night or what it had done until now.</t6127>
<t6128>My darling,</t6128>
<t6129>Don't worry.</t6129> <t6130>I'm fine, your father has strong influence here.</t6130> <t6131>You won't be able to reply to this letter.</t6131> <t6132>Kiss our child for me.</t6132>
<t6133>That was all.</t6133> <t6134>But it meant so much to the person to whom the note was sent that Luice, after turning to Defarge, kissed one of her knitting hands.</t6134> <t6135>This was a very emotional, loving, grateful, and womanly gesture, but the knitting hand did not respond – it fell coldly and heavily, and resumed its knitting.</t6135>
<t6136>With this attitude, Lucie came to her senses.</t6136> <t6137>She stopped just as she was about to tuck the note into her bosom and looked at Madam Defarge with fear-filled eyes, her hands at her neck.</t6137> <t6138>Madam Defarge scrutinized Lucie's raised eyebrows and forehead with a cold and indifferent expression.</t6138>
<t6139>"Look dear," Mr. Lorry began, "there are frequent uprisings in the streets; although they probably won't bother you, Madam Defarge likes to see and recognize the people she can protect in such times – so she can remember them later.</t6139> <t6140>Isn't that right, Citizen Defarge?" said Mr. Lorry, as the cruel demeanor of the three increased, Mr. Lorry's reassuring voice began to sound hesitant.</t6140>
<t6141>Defarge, with a stern face, looked at his wife and then grumbled in agreement without any other reaction.</t6141>
<t6142>Mr. Lorry said, "Come on, dear Lucie," trying to comfort Lucie as much as he could with both his tone and manner, "bring your sweet daughter and our good Pross here.</t6142> <t6143>Defarge, our good Pross is an Englishwoman and does not know a single word of French.</t6143><t6144>"</t6144>
<t6145>The woman in question, perhaps due to her strong belief that no stranger would harm her, felt neither distress nor fear; she had her arms crossed and said in English to the first person she noticed, Revenge, "Hey, you ugly thing!</t6145> <t6146>Hope you're doing well!"</t6146> <t6147>Then she coughed towards Madam Defarge; however, neither of the women paid any attention to her.</t6147>
<t6148>Madam Defarge, for the first time pausing her work and pointing her knitting needle at little Lucie as if it were the finger of fate, asked, "Is this her child?"</t6148>
<t6149>"Yes madam," replied Mr. Lorry; "this poor prisoner's beloved daughter, his only child."</t6149><t6150>"</t6150>
<t6151>The shadow cast by Madam Defarge and her companion over the child was so threatening and terrifying that the mother instinctively knelt beside her child and hugged him tightly.</t6151> <t6152>This time, the threatening and terrifying shadow of Madam Defarge and her companion fell upon both the mother and the child.</t6152>
<t6153>"That's enough, my dear husband," said Madam Defarge.</t6153> <t6154>"I have seen them.</t6154> <t6155>We can go now.</t6155><t6156>"</t6156>
<t6157>But the malice within this pressured attitude –it was not something visible, it was vague and implicit–</t6157> <t6158>was enough to alarm Lucie; clinging to Madam Defarge's dress, she said:</t6158>
<t6159>"Treat my poor husband well.</t6159> <t6160>Do not harm him.</t6160> <t6161>Help me see him!</t6161><t6162>"</t6162>
<t6163>"Your husband does not concern me," replied Madame Defarge, without losing her composure and looking down haughtily.</t6163> <t6164>"What concerns me is the daughter of your father.</t6164><t6165>"</t6165>
<t6166>"For my sake, treat my husband well.</t6166> <t6167>For the sake of my child!</t6167> <t6168>She will pray with her hands clasped for you to show him mercy.</t6168> <t6169>We fear you more than anyone else.</t6169><t6170>"</t6170>
<t6171>Madam Defarge took this as a compliment and looked at her husband.</t6171> <t6172>Defarge, who had been anxiously biting his thumbnail for a while, also looked at his wife and assumed a serious expression.</t6172>
<t6173>"What did your husband say to you in that short letter?" asked Madam Defarge with a contemptuous smile.</t6173> <t6174>"Was he talking about influence?</t6174> <t6175>Did he have great influence, or what?"</t6175><t6176>"</t6176>
<t6177>"My father," said Lucie, hastily taking the letter out of her bosom, but her anxious eyes were not on the note, they were on the one interrogating her, "mentions that my father has great influence there.</t6177><t6178>"</t6178>
<t6179>"Then they will certainly release him!" said Madam Defarge.</t6179> <t6180>"Let's see them try.</t6180><t6181>"</t6181>
<t6182>Lucie, with all her sincerity, began to cry, "I beg you as a wife and mother, have mercy on me and use the power you have not against my innocent husband, but for his benefit."</t6182> <t6183>Consider me as your sister.</t6183> <t6184>Do not forget that I am pleading with you as a wife and mother!"</t6184>
<t6185>Madam Defarge looked coldly at the woman as usual and turned to her friend Vengeance;</t6185>
<t6186>"Since our childhood, we have seen many wives and mothers, did anyone ever think about them?</t6186> <t6187>Didn't their husbands and fathers also serve time in prison and get separated from them?</t6187> <t6188>Throughout our lives, haven't we witnessed the pain they felt both for themselves and for their children while the women around us dealt with so much hunger, poverty, thirst, illness, misery, oppression, and indifference?</t6188><t6189>"</t6189>
<t6190>"We didn't see anything else," replied Revenge.</t6190>
<t6191>"It's been like this for as long as we can remember," said Madam Defarge, turning her eyes back to Lucie.</t6191> <t6192>"Now you decide!</t6192> <t6193>How much do we care about the pain of a single wife and mother?</t6193><t6194>"</t6194>
<t6195>She took her knitting and left the room.</t6195> <t6196>Revenge followed her.</t6196> <t6197>Finally, Defarge left and closed the door.</t6197>
<t6198>"Don't lose your courage, dear Lucie," said Mr. Lorry as he lifted her from the ground.</t6198> <t6199>"Courage, a little courage!</t6199> <t6200>So far everything has gone well – considering what has happened to poor people recently, we are in a very good situation.</t6200> <t6201>Cheer up and be thankful for our condition.</t6201><t6202>"</t6202>
<t6203>"It's not that I'm ungrateful, nor have I lost hope, but that dreadful woman has cast a shadow over me and all my hopes."</t6203><t6204>"</t6204>
<t6205>"Is it done now?" said Mr. Lorry; "what is this despair in that brave little heart?</t6205> <t6206>After all, it's just a shadow!</t6206> <t6207>It has no tangible aspect, Lucie.</t6207><t6208>"</t6208>
<t6209>However, the shadow in the demeanor of these Defarges had also settled upon him, constantly troubling his mind.</t6209>
<t6210>IV</t6210>
<t6211>Calm Before the Storm</t6211>
<t6212>Dr. Manette was able to return four days after leaving the house.</t6212> <t6213>During this dreadful period, they had managed to hide what was happening from Lucie as best as they could; so much so that the young woman learned long after leaving France that the people had killed eleven hundred defenseless prisoners of all ages, that this massacre had stained everything with blood for four days and four nights, and that the air surrounding her was actually filled with the scent of slaughter.</t6213> <t6214>She only knew that there had been an attack on the prisons, that all political prisoners were in danger, and that some had been taken out by the crowd and killed.</t6214>
<t6215>The doctor had secretly told Mr. Lorry that the crowd had taken him from La Force to the places where the massacre scenes had occurred.</t6215> <t6216>He had explained that a court had been set up in the prison, where the prisoners were brought one by one, and it was immediately decided whether they would be executed, released, or (in very few cases) sent back to their cells.</t6216> <t6217>Those who brought the doctor had introduced him to the court, and he had declared his name and profession as someone who had been unjustly imprisoned in the Bastille for eighteen years, at which point one of the judges had stood up and said he recognized him; this man was Defarge.</t6217>
<t6218>Then the Doctor learned from the records on the table that his son-in-law was on the list of the living, and he pleaded at length for his son-in-law's life and freedom to the court committee, some of whom were dozing, some awake, some with bloody hands, some clean, some drunk, some sober.</t6218> <t6219>As someone who had suffered greatly in this collapsed order, following the applause for the Doctor, it was decided that Charles Darnay would be brought before this unlawful committee and re-evaluated.</t6219> <t6220>At one point, just when he was about to be released, the favorable atmosphere inexplicably dissipated (the Doctor couldn't understand why), and they whispered something secretly among themselves.</t6220> <t6221>The person presiding over the committee then told Doctor Manette that the prisoner needed to be kept under supervision, but for his sake, he would be safe during this supervision.</t6221> <t6222>Upon this, with a signal, the prisoner was sent back to his cell; at that time, the Doctor pleaded so much with the court to ensure that his son-in-law could pass through the crowd that was suppressing the case with cruel screams rising behind the door and remain there without any harm or misfortune befalling him, that he finally got permission and waited there in that bloodthirsty hall until the danger had passed.</t6222>
<t6223>The things the Doctor saw between the few bites of food he snacked on and his dozing off were indescribable.</t6223> <t6224>The enthusiastic joy the public felt for the released prisoners was almost as surprising as the enthusiastic savagery they showed for those being torn apart.</t6224> <t6225>In fact, it had happened that a released prisoner was accidentally speared by a cruel person the moment he stepped out onto the street.</t6225> <t6226>Upon this, they begged the Doctor to go and tend to his wound, and he found the prisoner, passing through the same door, in the arms of a few compassionate men sitting on the bodies of their victims.</t6226> <t6227>Moreover, with a brutality as monstrous as this horrific nightmare, they both helped the Doctor and took great care of the wounded man – they immediately made a stretcher for him and moved him away from the scene – and then, grabbing their weapons, they resumed their butchery so horrifically that Doctor Manette covered his eyes with his hands and eventually fainted in the midst of the event.</t6227>
<t6228>Mr. Lorry, while listening to all these secrets and looking at the face of his friend who was now sixty-two years old, felt a doubt that these terrible experiences might trigger his old illness.</t6228> <t6229>But he had never seen him like this, he did not know this state of his.</t6229> <t6230>For the first time in his life, the Doctor felt that the pains he suffered gave him strength and endurance.</t6230> <t6231>For the first time in his life, amidst this great chaos, he felt that he was slowly forging the iron that would break the door of the prison where his daughter's husband was lying and take him to his wife.</t6231> <t6232>"Everything will be fine, my friend; nothing is actually wasted or destroyed.</t6232> <t6233>Just as my dear daughter helped me regain my health, I will help her reunite with her lover; I will do this if God permits!" said Doctor Manette.</t6233> <t6234>When Mr. Lorry saw the Doctor's blazing eyes, determined face, his firm and calm expression, and the endurance of this man who seemed to have been stopped like a clock for years and then restarted with the energy he had accumulated during all the time he lay dormant, he believed him.</t6234>
<t6235>On the determined path he embarked on, there were things much greater than what the Doctor was dealing with at the time.</t6235> <t6236>He was a doctor who attended to all kinds of people, whether chained or free, good or bad, and he used his influence so wisely that he soon took on the role of doctor for three prisons, including La Force.</t6236> <t6237>He could now tell Lucie that her husband was not alone, that he was among other prisoners; every week, he went to see her husband and conveyed what he said as sweet messages to her; sometimes her husband sent letters directly to her (never through the Doctor), but she was not allowed to write to him, as the most suspicious situations in the prisons arose from refugees known to have friends or acquaintances outside.</t6237>
<t6238>Undoubtedly, the Doctor's new life was a restless one; yet the sensible Mr. Lorry could see the new nourishing pride involved in it.</t6238> <t6239>There was nothing to mar this pride; it was natural and valuable; but he was also curious.</t6239> <t6240>The Doctor knew that until then, his imprisonment had been associated in the minds of his daughter and friend with his personal suffering, deficiency, and weakness.</t6240> <t6241>But now the situation was different, both knew that he saw his past painful experiences as a strength that would ensure Charles's safety and ultimate salvation, and this change had given him such life that the Doctor had taken control and leadership, asking the weak to trust in him as the strong one.</t6241> <t6242>In his relationship with Lucie, they had switched places, but this change stemmed from the gratitude and love they felt for each other, and the greatest pride was in helping the daughter who had once helped him so much.</t6242> <t6243>"How strange," thought Mr. Lorry in his usual charming and intelligent manner, "but of course a natural situation; so take control, my friend, and continue as such; it couldn't be in safer hands anyway.</t6243><t6244>"</t6244>
<t6245>Dear Doctor, no matter how hard he tried to get Charles Darnay released or at least brought to trial, events were unfolding very harshly and rapidly.</t6245> <t6246>A new era had begun; the King had been tried, sentenced to death, and beheaded; defying the world, the Republic of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death had been declared with the cry "Victory or Death!"; the black flag was waving day and night from the high towers of Notre Dame; three hundred thousand men from all over France had gathered to rise against the landowners, it seemed like the time had come to harvest the dragon's teeth sown into the ground, these had yielded crops equally in the mountains, plains, rocks, gravelly soil, alluvial mud, under the bright skies of the South and the clouds of the North, in pastures and forests, vineyards, olive groves, and fields of mown grass and corn, on the fertile banks of wide rivers and on the sandy shores by the sea, in every conceivable place.</t6246> <t6247>Who could stand alone against this flood in the first year of freedom –a flood that was not flowing from above but rising from below, with the windows of heaven not open but closed?</t6247>
<t6248>Neither a pause, nor pity, nor peace, nor a moment of mercy, nor even a concept of time existed.</t6248> <t6249>Even though night and day followed each other in their old patterns, and within the same day there was still a morning and an evening, no other measure of time remained.</t6249> <t6250>Just like a feverish patient, the people had completely forgotten time in the heat of this mad rage.</t6250> <t6251>Now the executioner, breaking the unusual silence of the vast city, was showing the people the King's head – and now, though it seemed to have happened immediately after, he was holding the gray-haired head of his beautiful wife, who had spent eight difficult and painful months in prison as a widow.</t6251>
<t6252>Thus, in accordance with the law of contrasts that is inevitable in such situations, a long time passed, and the fire quickly engulfed everything.</t6252> <t6253>In the capital, a revolutionary court was established, and nearly fifty thousand revolutionary committees were set up across the country; the law that was enacted for suspects endangered both freedoms and lives; as a result, good and innocent people were falling into the hands of bad and guilty individuals; prisons were crammed with people who had no sin and were not given a chance to defend themselves; this was the new order, and this was how things were functioning, and only a few weeks had passed, yet it was already seen as a long-standing tradition.</t6253> <t6254>The worst part was a disgusting figure that had become so familiar to the people as if it had existed since the world began – the stern lady, the guillotine itself.</t6254>
<t6255>There were a lot of jokes about it; it was said to be good for headaches, to prevent hair from graying, to give a special elegance to the skin, it was even called the "national razor" that shaves very cleanly; those who kissed the lady guillotine, after looking through the small window, would sneeze into the sack.</t6255> <t6256>This had become the symbol of the renewal of the human race.</t6256> <t6257>In a way, it had taken the place of the cross.</t6257> <t6258>Various models of guillotines now hung on people's chests where the cross used to be, and wherever the cross was denied, people bowed before this and believed in it.</t6258>
<t6259>The revolution had severed so many heads that both itself and the soil it tainted had turned completely red.</t6259> <t6260>Like a toy puzzle arranged for a young devil, it was broken into pieces and reassembled when necessary.</t6260> <t6261>It silenced the eloquent, toppled the strong, and eradicated the beautiful and the good.</t6261> <t6262>Twenty-two friends who had become public figures, twenty-one alive, one dead, and then one morning, all their heads were severed in succession.</t6262> <t6263>The strong executioner who had beheaded the king had been demoted to chief officer, but because he was armed, he was both stronger and blinder than his namesake and was busy every day destroying the doors of God's own temple.</t6263>
<t6264>Amidst all this horror and its consequences, the Doctor continued to walk with his head held high.</t6264> <t6265>Confident in his power, advancing with cautious steps, he had no doubt that he would ultimately save Lucie's husband.</t6265> <t6266>However, time was flowing so powerfully and deeply, and everything was happening so quickly, that during the days when the Doctor was still advancing with firm and confident steps, Charles had been in prison for a year and three months.</t6266> <t6267>In December, the revolution had become so cruel and insane that the southern rivers were impassable at night due to the bodies of those who had drowned and died horribly, and prisoners were being executed en masse under the southern winter sun.</t6267> <t6268>But the Doctor was still advancing with his head held high amidst all this savagery.</t6268> <t6269>In those days, everyone in Paris knew him; he was different from everyone else.</t6269> <t6270>Silent, humane, at the doors of both hospitals and prisons, practicing his profession equally for both killers and victims, he was a completely different person.</t6270> <t6271>His demeanor while working and the story of his imprisonment in the Bastille set him apart from everyone else.</t6271> <t6272>No one suspected him, no one asked him anything; the only thing they wanted to know was whether he had really been brought back to life eighteen years ago or if he was a spirit wandering among mortals.</t6272>
<t6273>V</t6273>
<t6274>Sawyer</t6274>
<t6275>One year and three months.</t6275> <t6276>Lucie lived every moment in fear that the guillotine would take her husband's head the next day.</t6276> <t6277>Every day, carts filled with prisoners rattled through the stone streets.</t6277> <t6278>Beautiful young girls, lovely ladies, brunettes, black-haired, white-haired; young men; strong men and old; nobles and peasants; all of them were becoming red wine for Madam Guillotine, every day being brought out from their disgusting cells into the daylight and carried through the streets to quench her insatiable thirst.</t6278> <t6279>Liberty, equality, fraternity, or death; the last one being the easiest to achieve, "Long live the Guillotine!</t6279><t6280>"</t6280>
<t6281>If these sudden disasters and the ever-turning wheels of time had bewildered the Doctor's daughter and plunged her into futile despair, she would be no different from many other people.</t6281> <t6282>But since the moment she pressed her white-haired head against her young chest in the attic in St. Antoine, she had fulfilled her duties in the best possible way.</t6282> <t6283>As every loyal and good person would do, she remained committed to her duties even during the days of judgment.</t6283>
<t6284>As soon as they settled into their new place and her father returned to his routine tasks, Lucie arranged the house as if her husband were there.</t6284> <t6285>Everything was in its proper place.</t6285> <t6286>She was also regularly tutoring little Lucie, just as she did in their home in England.</t6286> <t6287>To show her belief that they would soon be reunited, she played little games with herself—like setting aside his chair and books so that everything would be ready for the day Charles suddenly appeared—and at night, she prayed for her beloved husband among many unhappy prisoners in the shadow of death in the prison, thus distancing herself a little from the troubling thoughts that clouded her mind.</t6287>
<t6288>Lucie's appearance had not changed much.</t6288> <t6289>The plain black dresses that she and her daughter wore, reminiscent of mourning clothes, were as clean and neat as the brightly colored dresses they wore on happy days.</t6289> <t6290>Lucie's color had faded, and on her face, there was no longer just an occasional but a constant old anxious expression; otherwise, she was still very charming and beautiful.</t6290> <t6291>Sometimes, when she kissed her father at night, she would be overwhelmed by the deep pain she had hidden all day and would say that he was her only support in life.</t6291> <t6292>Her father would always say to her without hesitation: "They can't do anything to him without my knowledge, I will save him, Lucie.</t6292><t6293>"</t6293>
<t6294>It hadn't been long since this change in their lives when one evening, her father came home and said to Lucie:</t6294>
<t6295>"My dear daughter, on the upper floors of the prison, there is a window from which Charles can look out at three in the afternoon.</t6295> <t6296>When he can get there – if things go well and there are no mishaps – he says he might be able to see you on the street, provided you stand in the place I will show you.</t6296> <t6297>But you won't be able to see him, my poor girl, and even if you do, it would not be good for you to make any sign that shows you recognize him.</t6297><t6298>"</t6298>
<t6299>"Oh, please show me that place, Daddy, I will go there every day.</t6299><t6300>"</t6300>
<t6301>From that day on, Lucie waited there for two hours every day, in all kinds of weather, rain or shine.</t6301> <t6302>At 14:00,</t6302> <t6303>she would be there, and at 16:00,</t6303> <t6304>she would return, resigned to her fate.</t6304> <t6305>When it wasn't very rainy or cold, she would take her child with her; other times she went alone, and there wasn't a single day she didn't go.</t6305>
<t6306>It was a dark and filthy corner of a narrow and winding street.</t6306> <t6307>The only structure in this part of the street was the shack of a woodcutter who sold firewood; the rest was just walls.</t6307> <t6308>On the third day of Lucie's arrival there, the woodcutter noticed her.</t6308>
<t6309>"Good day, citizen.</t6309><t6310>"</t6310>
<t6311>"Good day to you too, citizen!"</t6311>
<t6312>It had now been decided that people would address each other in this manner.</t6312> <t6313>A while ago, this phrase had spontaneously emerged among fervent patriots, but now it was a law that everyone had to follow.</t6313>
<t6314>"Gene buralarda mı dolaşıyorsun yurttaş?</t6314><t6315>"</t6315>
<t6316>"As you can see, citizen!</t6316><t6317>"</t6317>
<t6318>The small and overly gesticulative sawyer (who was once a road worker) glanced at the prison, pointed at it, and in a comical manner, brought his ten fingers in front of his face like bars, pretending to look through them.</t6318>
<t6319>"Whatever, it's none of my business," he said.</t6319> <t6320>Then he continued chopping the wood.</t6320>
<t6321>The next day, he waited for Lucie and approached her as soon as she arrived.</t6321>
<t6322>"Huh? Are you wandering around here again, citizen?</t6322><t6323>"</t6323>
<t6324>"Yes, citizen.</t6324><t6325>"</t6325>
<t6326>"Ah! You've brought a child too!</t6326> <t6327>This is your mother, isn't it, little citizen?</t6327><t6328>"</t6328>
<t6329>Little Lucie snuggled up to her mother and whispered, "Should I say yes, mom?"</t6329>
<t6330>"Yes, my dear."</t6330><t6331>"</t6331>
<t6332>"Yes, citizen."</t6332><t6333>"</t6333>
<t6334>"Ah! But it doesn't concern me.</t6334> <t6335>I'll mind my own business.</t6335> <t6336>Have you seen my saw?</t6336> <t6337>I call it my little guillotine.</t6337> <t6338>La, la, la; la, la, la! There goes the man's head!</t6338><t6339>"</t6339>
<t6340>While Adam was talking, the log fell to the ground, and he picked it up and threw it into the basket.</t6340>
<t6341>"I call myself the Samson of the wood guillotine.</t6341> <t6342>Look now, again!</t6342> <t6343>Loo, loo, loo; loo, loo, loo!</t6343> <t6344>There goes the woman's head too!</t6344> <t6345>Now a child.</t6345> <t6346>Come on, giddy giddy; biddy biddy!</t6346> <t6347>There goes his head too.</t6347> <t6348>We've taken care of the whole family!</t6348><t6349>"</t6349>
<t6350>Lucie shuddered when the man threw two logs into the basket; but it was impossible to be there and not be seen by the sawyer while he was at work.</t6350> <t6351>Since that day, Lucie would first chat with him every time she went there to ensure he wouldn't cause any harm, and she often gave him money for drinks; he would accept it without any hesitation.</t6351>
<t6352>The sawyer was a curious man; sometimes, when Lucie would forget him and, with her eyes lost in the prison's roof and bars, open her heart to her husband, she would suddenly come to herself and find the man, with his saw halted in his hand, his knee braced against his stool, watching her.</t6352> <t6353>At such times, he would again, saying "This doesn't concern me!" desperately continue to cut the wood.</t6353>
<t6354>In all kinds of weather, in snow, in winter, in the harsh winds of spring, under the scorching sun of summer, in the autumn rains, and then again in snow, in winter, Lucie stood and waited in the same place for two hours every day, and every day, as she left, she kissed the wall of the prison.</t6354> <t6355>Her husband (according to what she learned from her father) sometimes saw her only once in five or six attempts, sometimes he saw her two or three days in a row, and sometimes he didn't see her at all for one or two weeks.</t6355> <t6356>But the possibility of her husband seeing her and sometimes actually seeing her was enough for her, and for this reason, she could stand there like that seven days a week.</t6356>
<t6357>As Lucie kept going back and forth and her father continued to march forward with his head held high amidst all that horror, December arrived.</t6357> <t6358>As the snow lightly fell, Lucie reached her usual corner.</t6358> <t6359>The people were celebrating with wild joy.</t6359> <t6360>On her way, she had seen houses decorated with small spears topped with little red hats; and also standard writing adorned with tricolored ribbons (the most popular were the tricolored letters):</t6360>
<t6361>"The Republic is One and Indivisible.</t6361> <t6362>Liberty, Equality, Fraternity or Death!</t6362><t6363>"</t6363>
<t6364>The wretched shop of the sawyer was so small that its facade was not enough to bear this inscription.</t6364> <t6365>But then he had found someone who could barely squeeze the word death into it.</t6365> <t6366>As a duty of being a good citizen, he had placed a spear and a hat on top of the shop and had put his saw, which he called "Little Saint Guillotine," in one of the windows – after all, this sharp lady was now known by everyone at that time.</t6366> <t6367>The shop was closed, and the sawyer was not there; thus, Lucie was left alone and took a deep breath.</t6367>
<t6368>But the sawyer was not far away, soon there was some commotion and Luice heard approaching shouts; she was filled with great fear.</t6368><t6369>Before long, a large group of people, with Vengeance and the Sawyer in the very middle, hand in hand, flowed like a torrent from the corner of the prison wall.</t6369><t6370>There were roughly five hundred people, and they danced as if they were five thousand demons.</t6370><t6371>There was no music other than the songs they sang themselves.</t6371><t6372>They danced to the popular song of the Revolution, keeping a cruel tempo that resembled the grinding of teeth.</t6372><t6373>Men and women danced together; sometimes only women, sometimes only men, as if this calamity had brought them together.</t6373><t6374>At first, they were a storm of rough red caps and coarse woolen clothes; but when they filled the street and stopped to dance around Lucie, the spirit of a terrible creature that danced in a frenzy awoke within them all.</t6374><t6375>They moved forward and backward, slapped each other's hands, then grabbed each other by the heads and spun alone, then held onto each other again and spun in pairs until many of them collapsed to the ground.</t6375><t6376>While they were on the ground, the others held hands and spun in a circle together; then the circle broke up again, and after spinning in pairs and fours, they all stopped together, then started again, slapped each other again, grabbed each other by the heads and broke up, then turned in the opposite direction, and then all began to turn in different directions.</t6376><t6377>Suddenly they stopped again, waited, and as if turning back time, lined up along the road in rows and advanced with their heads down and fists in the air, shouting.</t6377><t6378>No fight could be as terrifying as this dance.</t6378><t6379>It was such a strange thing – once innocent but now containing devilry – a healthy amusement that had turned into an event that ignited people's blood, upset their emotions, and hardened their hearts.</t6379><t6380>The visible measure of finesse it contained made this dance even uglier, showing how everything good could be twisted and corrupted.</t6380><t6381>The bare flanks of young girls, the wildly swaying beautiful heads almost childlike in age, and the delicate feet advancing through this swamp of blood and filth were all part of this maddened moment.</t6381>
<t6382>It was the Carmagnole dance.</t6382> <t6383>When the crowd left Lucie at the door of the woodcutter's hut, frightened and bewildered, snowflakes began to fall gently like feathers, covering the ground whiter and softer than ever before.</t6383>
<t6384>"Ah, daddy!" said Lucie, lifting her eyes, which she had momentarily covered with her hands, and seeing her father in front of her, "what a terrible, what an awful sight it was!</t6384><t6385>"</t6385>
<t6386>"I know, my dear, I know.</t6386> <t6387>I've seen these before.</t6387> <t6388>Don't be afraid!</t6388> <t6389>None of them can harm you.</t6389><t6390>"</t6390>
<t6391>"I am not afraid for myself, daddy.</t6391> <t6392>But when I think about my husband and how he is at the mercy of these people...</t6392><t6393>"</t6393>
<t6394>"We will rescue him from their mercy very soon.</t6394> <t6395>As I was coming, he was also going to the window, I came to tell you this.</t6395> <t6396>There is no one around to see now.</t6396> <t6397>You can blow a kiss to the window on the top floor.</t6397><t6398>"</t6398>
<t6399>"Okay, Dad, and with this kiss, I will also send my soul to him now.</t6399><t6400>"</t6400>
<t6401>"But you can't see him, can you, my poor little one?"</t6401><t6402>"</t6402>
<t6403>"No, father!" said Lucie, kissing his hand and sending a longing kiss while crying, "No!</t6403><t6404>"</t6404>
<t6405>Then, a footstep was heard in the snow.</t6405> <t6406>The one approaching was Madame Defarge.</t6406> <t6407>"Greetings, citizen," said the Doctor.</t6407> <t6408>"Greetings, citizen," she replied.</t6408> <t6409>They said nothing else.</t6409> <t6410>Madame Defarge moved forward like a shadow on the white path and disappeared from sight.</t6410>
<t6411>"Come into my arms, my dear.</t6411> <t6412>For his sake, pass through here with a cheerful and brave demeanor now.</t6412> <t6413>Well done," they had started walking; "and this cheerfulness is not in vain.</t6413> <t6414>Charles will appear in court again tomorrow.</t6414><t6415>"</t6415>
<t6416>"Tomorrow!</t6416><t6417>"</t6417>
<t6418>"We have no time to lose.</t6418> <t6419>I am well prepared, but there are precautions we need to take; these precautions could not be taken without him being formally summoned to court.</t6419> <t6420>The decision has not yet been communicated to him, but I am sure he will be brought to court tomorrow and sent to the Conciergerie Prison; I received the news just in time.</t6420> <t6421>You're not afraid, are you?</t6421><t6422>"</t6422>
<t6423>Lucie could barely say, "I trust you."</t6423>
<t6424>"You must trust.</t6424> <t6425>All your worries will soon come to an end, my dear; a few hours after the trial, you will be reunited with your beloved; I have ensured his safety in every way.</t6425> <t6426>Now I need to see Lorry.</t6426><t6427>"</t6427>
<t6428>He stopped.</t6428> <t6429>The sound of a slowly approaching car was heard.</t6429> <t6430>They both knew very well what this meant.</t6430> <t6431>One.</t6431> <t6432>Two.</t6432> <t6433>The three cars carrying the prisoners to the guillotine were moving over the calm snow with their dreadful loads.</t6433>
<t6434>"I need to see Lorry," he repeated.</t6434>
<t6435>This sturdy old man was still the person he trusted the most; this situation had never changed.</t6435> <t6436>He was frequently consulted, along with his records, for properties that had been confiscated and become state property.</t6436> <t6437>He also protected the property owners as much as he could.</t6437> <t6438>No one could protect what Tellson had as well as he did and do it with such composure.</t6438>
<t6439>The yellow tinged with red and the murky sky, along with the mist rising from the Seine River, heralded the evening.</t6439> <t6440>By the time they reached the bank, it was almost dark.</t6440> <t6441>The grand residence of the Monsignor was now in a state of ruin and abandonment.</t6441> <t6442>On the piles of dust and ash in the courtyard, these words were written:</t6442>
<t6443>"National Property.</t6443> <t6444>The Republic is One and Indivisible.</t6444> <t6445>Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death!</t6445><t6446>"</t6446>
<t6447>I wonder who was next to Mr. Lorry – the one with the riding jacket on the chair – and who was the person that was not supposed to be seen?</t6447> <t6448>In a nervous and bewildered state, who had this person, who emerged to embrace their loved one, just come from?</t6448> <t6449>Raising his voice and turning his head towards the door he entered, to whom could he have repeated Lucie's trembling words, "Sent to the Conciergerie and to be tried tomorrow?"</t6449>
<t6450>VI</t6450>
<t6451>Victory</t6451>
<t6452>The terrifying court panel, consisting of five judges, a prosecutor, and a determined jury, convened every day.</t6452> <t6453>The lists were sent to various prisons every evening and were read to the prisoners by the guards there.</t6453> <t6454>"Inmates, come closer and listen to the evening newspaper!" was a joke made by many guards.</t6454>
<t6455>"Charles Evremonde, that is, Darnay!"</t6455>
<t6456>Thus, the evening newspaper session finally began at La Force.</t6456>
<t6457>The people whose names were called would move to the place reserved for prisoners awaiting death.</t6457> <t6458>Charles Evremonde, that is, Darnay, knew what this meant; for hundreds had gone this way before.</t6458>
<t6459>The chubby-faced guard, who had put on glasses to read the names, looked up to make sure the person he called was in place, then returned to his list and repeated the same process for each name.</t6459> <t6460>There were twenty-three names on the list, but only twenty people responded, because one of those called had died and been forgotten in his cell, and two others had already been executed by guillotine and forgotten.</t6460> <t6461>The list was being read in the domed hall where Charles Darnay had first encountered the other prisoners on the night he arrived at the prison.</t6461> <t6462>All those prisoners had been wiped out in the massacre; everyone Darnay had grown close to and then parted from since his arrival had died on the gallows.</t6462>
<t6463>After the hasty farewell words and good wishes they exchanged, they quickly parted ways.</t6463> <t6464>This was a daily occurrence, and then the La Force community plunged into preparations for the evening's games to be held for the losses of the day, and a small concert.</t6464> <t6465>They gathered in front of the bars and wept; but the twenty people who left for the evening's entertainment needed to be replaced, and there was little time left until the doors were locked; the large dogs were handed over to guard the common rooms and corridors throughout the night.</t6465> <t6466>The prisoners were not insensitive or callous; they were merely acting in the manner required by the times.</t6466> <t6467>Similarly, albeit with a subtle difference, a kind of exhilaration or intoxication undoubtedly gave some of them unnecessary courage as they went to the guillotine, and because of this, dying was not only something to be proud of but also like a dreadful infection spreading from the frenzied minds of the public.</t6467> <t6468>Like the desire some had to contract the disease during the plague – strangely, they wanted to die from it.</t6468> <t6469>In fact, there are such oddities hidden within all of us, waiting for certain conditions to emerge.</t6469>
<t6470>The road to the Conciergerie was short and dark; the night spent in its vermin-filled cells, however, was long and cold.</t6470> <t6471>The next day, fifteen prisoners were tried before Charles Darnay's name was called.</t6471> <t6472>All of them were found guilty, and their trial lasted an hour and a half.</t6472>
<t6473>After a while, they called him to the stand, saying, "Charles Evremonde, who goes by the name Darnay."</t6473>
<t6474>The jurors were sitting with furry hats; but many others had coarse red hats and tricolor rosettes.</t6474> <t6475>When Charles Darnay looked at the jury and the noisy crowd, he perhaps thought that everything had turned upside down and that criminals were judging honest people.</t6475> <t6476>The lowest, most cruel, and most vile segment of the city, with their not at all low and vile numbers, was directing the spirit of the hall; they were loudly expressing opinions, applauding, opposing, speculating, and making the jury decide in an instant.</t6476> <t6477>Most of the men had various kinds of weapons; the women were carrying knives or daggers, and while some were following the trial by eating and drinking, many were knitting.</t6477> <t6478>Among those knitting was a woman who, besides her knitting, had an empty bottle tucked under her arm.</t6478> <t6479>She was in the front row, next to Defarge, whom Charles had not seen since the first day he reached the barrier but recognized immediately upon seeing.</t6479> <t6480>He saw the woman whispering something into the man's ear a few times and thought she was his wife; but what caught his attention the most while looking at these two was that, despite standing so close to him, they never looked at him.</t6480> <t6481>It was as if they were waiting for something with stubborn determination and never took their eyes off the jury for even a moment.</t6481> <t6482>In front of the president, in his usual plain attire, sat Doctor Manette.</t6482> <t6483>As far as the prisoner could see, there were only himself and Mr. Lorry, who had not donned the coarse carmagnole outfits but were in their usual clothes and had no connection with the court.</t6483>
<t6484>Charles Evremonde, that is Darnay, was accused of being an émigré by the prosecutor and, based on the law that condemned all émigrés to death, he too had to pay the price of the Republic with his life.</t6484> <t6485>It did not matter that the law had been enacted after he had returned to France.</t6485> <t6486>He was before them now, and the law was before them as well; Evremonde had come to France secretly and his head was demanded.</t6486>
<t6487>"Off with his head!" shouted the people, "He's an enemy of the Republic!</t6487><t6488>"</t6488>
<t6489>The chairman rang his bell to silence the shouting and asked the prisoner if it was true that he had been living in England for a long time.</t6489>
<t6490>Undoubtedly, it was so.</t6490>
<t6491>Wasn't he a refugee then?</t6491> <t6492>What did he call himself?</t6492>
<t6493>He did not consider himself a refugee in the sense contained in the law.</t6493>
<t6494>Why was he thinking this way?</t6494> <t6495>The president wanted to know.</t6495>
<t6496>Because he had willingly given up a title he never liked and a position he never liked, he had left his country – he accepted the current refugee definition of the court – but in France, instead of living off others, he wanted to make a name for himself in England through his own efforts.</t6496>
<t6497>How was he going to prove this?</t6497>
<t6498>He gave the names of two witnesses:</t6498>
<t6499>Theophile Gabelle and Alexandre Manette.</t6499>
<t6500>But didn't she get married in England?</t6500> <t6501>The president immediately reminded.</t6501>
<t6502>It was true, but not with an Englishman.</t6502>
<t6503>Was he/she a French citizen?</t6503>
<t6504>Yes.</t6504> <t6505>By birth.</t6505>
<t6506>What was their name, who was their family?</t6506>
<t6507>"Lucie Manette, the only daughter of the kind-hearted Doctor Manette sitting over there."</t6507><t6508>"</t6508>
<t6509>This response had a positive effect on the public.</t6509> <t6510>When they heard the name of the well-known, kind-hearted doctor, the people in the hall shouted with enthusiasm.</t6510> <t6511>People's emotions were so fickle that, just a minute ago, the savage faces that were looking at the convict with the thought of dragging him out and killing him were now shedding tears.</t6511>
<t6512>Charles Darnay took his first steps on this dangerous path.</t6512> <t6513>He had taken them in accordance with the advice that Doctor Manette had repeatedly given him.</t6513> <t6514>Every step ahead of him had been determined by this cautious advisor, who had calculated every inch of the path he would take.</t6514>
<t6515>The chairman asked him why he returned to France on the date he was arrested instead of earlier.</t6515>
<t6516>He hadn't returned before; because in France, apart from those things he had abandoned, he had nothing to sustain himself with; whereas in England, he made a living by teaching French language and literature.</t6516> <t6517>He had returned here at the persistent and written request of a French citizen who claimed that his life was in danger due to his absence.</t6517> <t6518>He had come to save a citizen's life and to testify for him, to tell the truth, no matter the cost.</t6518> <t6519>Could this have been a crime committed against the Republic?</t6519>
<t6520>The crowd shouted enthusiastically, "No!" and the President rang his bell to silence them.</t6520> <t6521>But it didn't work, because they were still</t6521> <t6522>shouting "No!", then suddenly the voices stopped on their own.</t6522>
<t6523>The President wanted to learn the name of this citizen.</t6523> <t6524>The defendant said that the person in question was his first witness.</t6524> <t6525>Then, confidently, he spoke about the letter that had been taken from him at the barrier but should now be among the papers in front of the President.</t6525> <t6526>The doctor – as he had previously promised Darnay – had ensured that the letter was there, and when it came time for the trial records, it was produced and read.</t6526> <t6527>Citizen Gabelle was called to verify its authenticity, and he confirmed it.</t6527> <t6528>Then Citizen Gabelle subtly and politely implied that the court had forgotten him in the Abbaye Prison due to the abundance of enemies of the Republic it had to deal with – in fact, he had been completely erased from the court's patriotic memory – and this situation had come to light three days before his trial, and with the surrender of Citizen Evremonde, that is, Darnay, the jury declared that the charge against Gabelle had been dropped and he was released.</t6528>
<t6529>The next person to be questioned was Doctor Manette.</t6529> <t6530>His beloved personality and the clarity of his answers had a great impact on the people; but when he continued speaking and said that the first friend he made after being freed from his long imprisonment was this defendant, and when he stated that during the defendant's years of exile in England, he had always been loyal and devoted to his daughter and himself, that he had no connection with the aristocratic government there, and that he was even judged for being an enemy of England and a friend of America – when he revealed all these details with all his common sense, reality, and sincerity, the jury agreed with the public.</t6530> <t6531>Finally, when Doctor Manette said that the English gentleman named Mr. Lorry, who was present there, had testified just like him in the court in England and could confirm what he had just said, the jury stated that this was sufficient and that they could announce their decision if it was also suitable for the President.</t6531>
<t6532>In each vote, the Jury members were announcing their votes one by one, out loud, and the crowd was applauding with great enthusiasm.</t6532> <t6533>They had all voted in favor of the defendant, and the President announced that he was acquitted.</t6533>
<t6534>Then one of those strange scenes began to unfold, revealing how fickle a crowd can be, or how impulses can turn into generosity and compassion, or how a swelling cruel rage can come to an end.</t6534> <t6535>No one could say which of these strange scenes was the main reason; perhaps it was a mixture of all of them, especially the second one.</t6535> <t6536>Not long after the blood had been shed, the courtroom was flooded with tears due to the acquittal, and so many men and women ran to him at once, embracing him with brotherly feelings, that Darnay, after that tedious and long imprisonment, felt he might collapse from exhaustion; on the other hand, he knew very well that the same crowd, if swept by a different current, would have rushed at him with the same intensity to tear him to pieces and scatter him in the streets.</t6536>
<t6537>When they took Darnay out to make room for the other prisoners to be tried, he was freed from all those embraces.</t6537> <t6538>The next five people were to be tried collectively as enemies of the Republic, for they had neither supported the Republic in word nor in deed.</t6538> <t6539>The court, as if eager to quickly make up for the gap and this national loss, decided that these five men, who were brought in before Darnay even left the hall, would be executed within twenty-four hours.</t6539> <t6540>The foremost prisoner conveyed this decision to Darnay with the death sign that had become customary in the prisons – by raising his finger –</t6540> <t6541>and they all shouted together, "Long live the Republic!"</t6541>
<t6542>In truth, these five people no longer had any spectators to prolong their trials, because the moment Darnay and Doctor Manette stepped out the door, a huge crowd accompanied them, and they were all the types seen in the courtroom – except for the two people Darnay had looked for in vain.</t6542> <t6543>As soon as they stepped outside, the crowd, with tearful eyes and shouting, surrounded them again, until the waters of the river, where this mad scene took place, swelled and overflowed, they pounced on them sometimes one by one, sometimes in groups.</t6543>
<t6544>They seated Darnay on a rather large chair that must have been found either in the courtroom, one of the rooms of the courthouse, or one of its corridors.</t6544> <t6545>They had draped a red flag over the chair and tied a spear with a red cap at its end to the back of it.</t6545> <t6546>While he was on this triumphal chariot, not even the Doctor's pleas could prevent him from being carried on shoulders all the way to his home, and when he saw those excited faces rising from the depths and reaching a crescendo in the sea of red caps swirling around him, Darnay's mind became confused and disoriented, and he felt as though he were in an execution cart on the way to the guillotine.</t6546>
<t6547>They continued this dreamlike wild procession, hugging everyone they encountered and showing them Darnay.</t6547> <t6548>They wound their way through those snowy streets, which they had previously painted a deep red, and this time carried him to the courtyard of the house where he lived, painting everything in the color of the Republic.</t6548> <t6549>His father had gone to the house earlier to prepare his daughter, and when Lucie saw her husband in front of her, she let herself fall into his arms.</t6549>
<t6550>When Darnay pressed his wife to his heart and turned her beautiful head so that their lips, joined by his own tears, would not be seen by the crowd, a group of people began to dance.</t6550> <t6551>Then the others also started to dance, and the courtyard was suddenly filled with the enthusiasm of the carmagnole.</t6551> <t6552>Later, they seated a young woman from the crowd on the empty chair as the "goddess of liberty" and carried her through the streets with the same enthusiasm, flowing from there to the riverbank, and then to the bridge, spinning everyone they encountered into the carmagnole.</t6552>
<t6553>After shaking hands firmly with Mr. Lorry, who was breathless from the struggle to resist the cannagnole flood, and standing before him with a triumphant and proud demeanor, Charles Darnay kissed little Lucie, who had been lifted up to hug him, embraced the sturdy and loyal Miss Pross who had lifted her, and then carried his wife in his arms to their rooms.</t6553>
<t6554>"Lucie! My darling! I am free now."</t6554><t6555>"</t6555>
<t6556>"Ah Charles, my love, after all my pleading, now I will kneel and give thanks to God."</t6556><t6557>"</t6557>
<t6558>They all bowed their heads with respect and placed their hands on their hearts.</t6558> <t6559>When Darnay took Lucie into his arms again, he said to her;</t6559>
<t6560>"Now pray for your father, my love.</t6560> <t6561>No one in France would do what he did for me," she said. Long ago, just as she had rested her poor father's head on her chest, this time Lucie rested her head on her father's chest.</t6561> <t6562>The doctor was happy that he could do this for his daughter; he had paid the price for his suffering and was proud of the strength he possessed.</t6562> <t6563>"Pull yourself together now, my dear," he said, as if reproaching her; "what is there to be so afraid of?</t6563> <t6564>I saved him, didn't I.</t6564><t6565>"</t6565>
<t6566>VII</t6566>
<t6567>The Door is Knocking</t6567>
<t6568>"I saved him, that's it."</t6568> <t6569>This wasn't one of the dreams he often had; Charles was really beside them.</t6569> <t6570>His wife, however, was still trembling and had a vague but intense fear inside her.</t6570>
<t6571>The weather was so foggy and dark, people were so filled with intense hatred and fickleness, innocent people were being sent to death so frequently due to a small suspicion or sheer malice, and it was so impossible to forget that every day many men, who were as innocent as their husbands and as valuable to their wives as their husbands, were experiencing the same fate as their husbands, that Lucie's heart could not lighten as much as she had hoped.</t6571> <t6572>The shadows of the winter noon had begun to fall, and even now those dreadful carts were rumbling through the streets.</t6572> <t6573>Her mind drifted there, and her eyes searched for her husband among the convicts; then she clung to the body right next to her and shivered a little more.</t6573>
<t6574>His father, who was trying to cheer him up, showed such a loving strength in response to this woman's weakness that it was wonderful to see.</t6574> <t6575>Now there was neither the attic, nor the shoemaking, nor the One Hundred and Five North Tower!</t6575> <t6576>He had accomplished the task he had set his mind to, kept his promise, and saved Charles.</t6576> <t6577>They could now trust him in every matter.</t6577>
<t6578>They managed the house in a very frugal manner; not because it was the safest way to live or because it prevented them from despising people, but because they had no money, and during Charles's imprisonment, he had spent a lot of money on the bad food given to him, for his guard, and for other poorer prisoners.</t6578> <t6579>Both for this reason and to avoid having a spy in the house, they did not hire a servant; only the citizens, one woman and one man, who were occasionally on duty at the gate of the courtyard, served them; Jerry (whom Mr. Lorry had completely put at their disposal) took care of their daily chores and stayed with them at night.</t6579>
<t6580>"The Republic is One and Indivisible.</t6580> <t6581>According to the decree of 'Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death,' the name of the residents of each house had to be engraved on the door or side of the house, in letters of a certain size, at a certain height from the ground, and in a legible manner.</t6581> <t6582>Thus, the name of Mr. Jerry Cruncher also adorned the bottom of the list as required, and when the shadows began to lengthen in the afternoon, the owner of this name appeared, observing the painter whom Doctor Manette had assigned the task of adding the name Charles Evremonde, also known as Darnay, to the list.</t6582>
<t6583>In the universal fear and insecurity that darkened the era, all harmless lifestyles had changed.</t6583> <t6584>In the doctor's small house, as in many other houses, all the necessities for the next day were bought in small amounts from various small shops every evening.</t6584> <t6585>The important thing was not to attract attention, to avoid gossip and jealousy.</t6585>
<t6586>For a few months, Miss Pross and Mr. Cruncher had been buying the provisions; Miss Pross carried the money, and the other carried the basket.</t6586> <t6587>Every evening when the street lamps were lit, they would set out to perform this duty, and after purchasing the necessary provisions, they would bring them home.</t6587> <t6588>Although Miss Pross had been with a French family for a long time, she couldn't speak French at all; yet, if she had a bit of sense, she could speak it as if it were her native language; after all, (in her own words) she knew no more about this "nonsense" than Mr. Cruncher did.</t6588> <t6589>Therefore, upon entering the shop, she had developed a way of shopping where she would say the first word that came to mind without knowing what it meant; if that thing wasn't what she wanted, she would look around with this item in her hand and not put it down until the bargaining was over.</t6589> <t6590>She would always negotiate while holding this item, and regardless of the price, she would always indicate one finger less than the price the merchant indicated with his fingers.</t6590>
<t6591>Miss Pross, her eyes red with happiness, said, "Well Mr. Cruncher, if you're ready, let's go."</t6591><t6592>"</t6592>
<t6593>Jerry joined Miss Pross in a hoarse voice.</t6593> <t6594>The rust color on his hands had long gone, but nothing could blunt his spiky hair.</t6594>
<t6595>"We have a lot of things to get," said Miss Pross, "it will take quite some time.</t6595> <t6596>We also need to get some wine.</t6596> <t6597>No matter where we get it from, these red-capped people are toasting everywhere.</t6597><t6598>"</t6598>
<t6599>Jerry immediately responded, "Whether they drink to your health or the old man's, I think it all comes down to the same thing for you, Miss.</t6599><t6600>"</t6600>
<t6601>"Who is the old man?" said Miss Pross.</t6601>
<t6602>Mr. Cruncher, somewhat hesitantly, said, "Old Nick."</t6602>
<t6603>Miss Pross said, "Haa! There is no need to explain what these men are up to.</t6603> <t6604>They have only one occupation, which is to kill people and cause trouble at midnight.</t6604><t6605>"</t6605>
<t6606>"Shh! Please, please be careful, dear!" Lucie shouted.</t6606>
<t6607>"Alright, alright, I'll be careful," said Miss Pross; "between you and me, I hope we don't run into any types on the road whose breath smells like onions and tobacco.</t6607> <t6608>Now my little bird, don't get up from this fire until I return, okay?</t6608> <t6609>Take good care of your husband until I come back and keep that beautiful head of yours, just like now, resting on his shoulder!</t6609> <t6610>Before I leave, may I ask you something, Mr. Manette?" The Doctor replied with a smile, "Of course, it's your right."</t6610>
<t6611>"For God's sake, don't talk to me about justice; I hear enough about it already," said Miss Pross.</t6611>
<t6612>Luice, "Hush! Again, my dear?" she reproached.</t6612>
<t6613>Miss Pross nodded her head vigorously forward, "Alright darling," she said, "in short, I am loyal to His Majesty King George III."</t6613> <t6614>Miss Pross had curtsied as she mentioned the king's name, "and as I always say, may their policies fail, their deceitful schemes collapse, and subsequently may we achieve our hopes, God save the King!"</t6614>
<t6615>Mr. Cruncher, with a faithful demeanor and a gruff voice, as if he were in church, repeated Miss Pross's words.</t6615>
<t6616>"I'm glad you're a true Englishwoman, but of course, I wish you hadn't caught a cold and lost your voice," said Miss Pross approvingly.</t6616> <t6617>"But Doctor Manette, my question to you is this.</t6617> <t6618>Is there" –she was trying to shed a light of hope on a matter that worried everyone– "is there any chance of us getting out of here?</t6618><t6619>"</t6619>
<t6620>"Unfortunately, there is no more.</t6620> <t6621>This could still be dangerous for Charles.</t6621><t6622>"</t6622>
<t6623>Miss Pross, looking at the golden hair of her sweet child shining in the fireplace, sighed deeply and said, "Well, what can we do!"</t6623> <t6624>"Then there's nothing to do but to be patient and wait, as my brother Solomon said, we will hold our heads high and fight."</t6624> <t6625>"Come on, Mr. Cruncher! –You stay right where you are, my little bird!"</t6625><t6626>"</t6626>
<t6627>They left Lucie, her husband, her father, and her child by the bright fire and went out.</t6627> <t6628>Mr. Lorry would arrive from the bank shortly.</t6628> <t6629>Miss Pross had lit the lamp, but she had placed it in a distant corner so they could enjoy the fireplace.</t6629> <t6630>Little Lucie sat next to her grandfather and held his arm tightly, and her grandfather began to tell, in a whispering voice, the story of a great and powerful fairy who had done him a favor beforehand by opening the wall of a prison and freeing a prisoner.</t6630> <t6631>A sense of tranquility enveloped everything, and Lucie felt much more at ease.</t6631>
<t6632>"What was that?" he suddenly shouted.</t6632>
<t6633>The father paused his story, took his daughter's hand, and said, "Calm down, my dear.</t6633> <t6634>How tense you are!</t6634> <t6635>Such things –nothing– should not scare you!</t6635> <t6636>You are your father's daughter!"</t6636>
<t6637>Lucie, with a pale face and a trembling voice, as if apologizing, said, "I thought I heard a footstep on the stairs, father.</t6637><t6638>"</t6638>
<t6639>"My dear, the stairs are as silent as a dead person.</t6639><t6640>"</t6640>
<t6641>As soon as the doctor said this, a knock was heard at the door.</t6641>
<t6642>"Oh father, father.</t6642> <t6643>Who could this be!</t6643> <t6644>Hide Charles, save him!</t6644><t6645>"</t6645>
<t6646>When the doctor stood up and placed his hand on his daughter's shoulder, he said, "My dear, I have already saved him."</t6646> <t6647>What is this weakness, my child!</t6647> <t6648>Let me go and check that door.</t6648><t6649>"</t6649>
<t6650>He took the lamp in his hand, passed through the two rooms in between, and opened the door.</t6650> <t6651>In front of the door, there were feet making clattering noises, and four rough men wearing red hats, armed with swords and pistols, rushed in immediately.</t6651>
<t6652>"Where is the citizen Evremonde known as Darnay?" said the one in front.</t6652>
<t6653>"Who is looking for him?" replied Darnay.</t6653>
<t6654>"I am searching.</t6654> <t6655>We are searching.</t6655> <t6656>I know you, Evremonde; I saw you before the court today.</t6656> <t6657>We are arresting you again in the name of the Republic.</t6657><t6658>"</t6658>
<t6659>All four of them immediately surrounded Darnay, who was tightly held by his wife and child.</t6659>
<t6660>"Can you tell me how and why I am being arrested again?</t6660><t6661>"</t6661>
<t6662>"You need to go straight to the Conciergerie, you will learn there.</t6662> <t6663>You will appear in court tomorrow.</t6663><t6664>"</t6664>
<t6665>Dr. Manette was so petrified by this visit that he stood holding the lamp as if he were a statue made to hold it, and upon hearing these words, he moved and placed the lamp on the ground; then he stood in front of the person who had spoken, and without being rude, he grabbed the loose collar of his red woolen shirt and said:</t6665>
<t6666>"You said you knew him.</t6666> <t6667>Do you know me then?</t6667><t6668>"</t6668>
<t6669>"Yes, I know you, Citizen Doctor.</t6669><t6670>"</t6670>
<t6671>"We all know you, Citizen Doctor," said the other three as well.</t6671>
<t6672>After the doctor thoughtfully scrutinized them, he said in a low voice:</t6672>
<t6673>"So, will you give me the answer to his question?</t6673> <t6674>How did this happen?</t6674><t6675>"</t6675>
<t6676>The man in front reluctantly said, "Citizen Doctor, this man has been denounced to the St Antoine district.</t6676> <t6677>This citizen," he said, pointing to the second man who had entered, "is from St Antoine.</t6677><t6678>"</t6678>
<t6679>The indicated citizen nodded and added:</t6679>
<t6680>"Found guilty by St Antoine."</t6680><t6681>"</t6681>
<t6682>"Why?" asked the Doctor.</t6682>
<t6683>The man in front said reluctantly, "Citizen Doctor, don't ask any more questions.</t6683> <t6684>If the Republic asks you to make a sacrifice, a good citizen fulfills it without hesitation and with pleasure.</t6684> <t6685>The Republic comes before everything.</t6685> <t6686>The people are noble.</t6686> <t6687>Evremonde, our time is running out.</t6687><t6688>"</t6688>
<t6689>"One minute," insisted the Doctor.</t6689> <t6690>"Can you tell me who reported him?</t6690><t6691>"</t6691>
<t6692>The man in front replied, "This is against the rules," he said, "but you can ask Citizen St. Antoine about it.</t6692><t6693>"</t6693>
<t6694>The doctor turned his eyes towards the man.</t6694> <t6695>After the man fidgeted nervously and lightly stroked his beard, he said:</t6695>
<t6696>"Hey! This is really against the rules.</t6696> <t6697>But –personally–</t6697> <t6698>He was denounced by Citizen Defarge and his wife.</t6698> <t6699>There was another one.</t6699><t6700>"</t6700>
<t6701>"Who is that?</t6701><t6702>"</t6702>
<t6703>"Do you really want to know this, Citizen Doctor?</t6703><t6704>"</t6704>
<t6705>"Yes.</t6705><t6706>"</t6706>
<t6707>With a strange expression on his face, the man from St. Antoine said, "Then you will learn the answer to this question tomorrow.</t6707> <t6708>Now I am mute!</t6708><t6709>"</t6709>
<t6710>VIII</t6710>
<t6711>Cards in Hand</t6711>
<t6712>Miss Pross, unaware of the new disaster at home, happily passed through the narrow streets and crossed the Pont-Neuf Bridge with a list of things she needed to get in her mind.</t6712> <t6713>Mr. Cruncher was walking beside her with a basket in his hand.</t6713> <t6714>They looked to the right and left of the shops they passed, cautiously examined every kind of crowded group huddled together, and if they saw them talking heatedly, they changed their route.</t6714> <t6715>It was a cold and damp evening, and the barges where blacksmiths working for the Republic Army were making weapons blurred their eyes with bright lights and made their ears ring with loud noises on the misty river.</t6715> <t6716>The situation was dire for those playing tricks on the Army or those who were unjustly promoted here!</t6716> <t6717>"The National Razor" would give them a deep shave, so it was better if their beards didn't grow.</t6717>
<t6718>After buying a few small grocery items and some oil for the lamp, Miss Pross remembered that they wanted wine.</t6718> <t6719>After glancing at a few wine shops, she stopped in front of a place near the National Palace, formerly the Tuileries, which had a sign that read "Good Republican of Antiquity Brutus"; its exterior had caught her interest.</t6719> <t6720>It appeared calmer compared to similar places they had passed by, and although there were patriots with red hats inside, it wasn't as red as the others.</t6720> <t6721>After checking with Mr. Cruncher and seeing that they were of the same mind, she entered the Good Republican Brutus's shop with her escort.</t6721>
<t6722>The inside was a bit smoky; men playing with worn-out playing cards and domino tiles, with pipes in their mouths; a worker, covered in soot, with one chest and arm bare, reading a newspaper loudly, surrounded by people listening to him; two or three customers, resembling bears or dogs, dozing off, with their weapons either strapped on or set aside, lounging in their padded black coats; while these two foreign customers approached the counter and pointed out what they wanted.</t6722>
<t6723>While the wines were being filled, a man in a corner stood up after saying goodbye to another man.</t6723> <t6724>As he was leaving, he came face to face with Miss Pross, who, upon seeing him, let out a scream and clapped her hands.</t6724>
<t6725>Suddenly, everyone jumped to their feet.</t6725> <t6726>It was a common occurrence for someone to be killed as a result of a disagreement.</t6726> <t6727>Everyone looked to see who had fallen, but they only saw a man and a woman standing and looking at each other; the man appeared to be a Frenchman and a staunch Republican, while the woman was evidently English.</t6727>
<t6728>After this disappointment, the words spoken loudly and fluently by the disciples of the Ancient Good Republican Brutus, no matter how much they listened, were no different from Hebrew or Chaldean for Miss Pross and her protector.</t6728> <t6729>But they were in no state to listen to anyone out of astonishment anyway.</t6729> <t6730>For Miss Pross had become blind to her surroundings due to the amazement and worry she had fallen into, and Mr. Cruncher – in his own way and measures – was engulfed in tremendous curiosity.</t6730>
<t6731>The man who caused Miss Pross to scream asked in a nervous and rude manner (but in a low voice) and in English, "What happened?"</t6731>
<t6732>Miss Pross clapped her hands again, shouting, "Oh Solomon, dear Solomon!"</t6732> <t6733>"I haven't seen your face or heard your voice for so long, I can't believe you're standing before me now!</t6733><t6734>"</t6734>
<t6735>Adam said, "Don't call me Solomon.</t6735> <t6736>Do you want me to die?" he asked in a voice full of fear and evasion.</t6736>
<t6737>"My brother, my brother!" Miss Pross cried out, bursting into tears.</t6737> <t6738>"Have I ever done you any harm that you ask me such a cruel question?</t6738><t6739>"</t6739>
<t6740>"Then hold that busybody tongue of yours now," said Solomon, "if you want to talk to me, come outside.</t6740> <t6741>Pay for your wine and come outside.</t6741> <t6742>Who is this man?</t6742><t6743>"</t6743>
<t6744>Miss Pross, shaking her loving and sorrowful head at her not-at-all affectionate brother, said tearfully, "Mr. Cruncher."</t6744>
<t6745>Solomon said, "Let him come."</t6745> <t6746>"Why is he looking at me as if I'm a ghost?"</t6746><t6747>"</t6747>
<t6748>Judging by his looks, Mr. Cruncher seemed to have truly mistaken him for a ghost.</t6748> <t6749>Not a single word came out of his mouth, but Miss Pross, in tears, barely managed to rummage through the bottom of her bag to pay for the wine.</t6749> <t6750>After Miss Pross paid the money, Solomon turned to the patrons of the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity and made an announcement in French, after which everyone sat down and returned to their occupations.</t6750>
<t6751>Solomon, "Tell me," he said, standing on a dark street corner, "what do you want?</t6751><t6752>"</t6752>
<t6753>Miss Pross, still teary-eyed, said, "Is this how one greets a sister who loves them so much, speaking to her so rudely, so badly?"</t6753>
<t6754>"Alright, alright!"</t6754> <t6755>"Here you go," said Solomon and planted a small kiss on his sister's lips.</t6755> <t6756>"Are you happy now?</t6756><t6757>"</t6757>
<t6758>Miss Pross silently cried, only nodding her head.</t6758>
<t6759>"If you expect me to be surprised," said his brother Solomon, "I am not surprised at all; I knew you were here, I know most of the people here.</t6759> <t6760>If you don't want to put my life in danger – which I think is what you're doing – you should go your own way as soon as possible, and I'll go mine.</t6760> <t6761>I have a lot of work to do.</t6761> <t6762>I am on duty.</t6762><t6763>"</t6763>
<t6764>Miss Pross lifted her tearful eyes and lamented, "My English brother Solomon, who could have been one of the best and foremost men of his own country, has become an officer serving foreigners, and such foreigners at that!</t6764> <t6765>To see you like this...</t6765><t6766>"</t6766>
<t6767>His brother interrupted him, shouting, "I know, I know!"</t6767> <t6768>"It's obvious.</t6768> <t6769>You'd prefer me dead.</t6769> <t6770>I'll be suspected because of my own brother.</t6770> <t6771>And just when I had everything under control!</t6771><t6772>"</t6772>
<t6773>"May the Almighty God undo it if He has written it!" cried Miss Pross.</t6773> <t6774>"Dear Solomon, even though I love you with all my heart, it is better that I never see you again than to be the cause of your death.</t6774> <t6775>But tell me one nice thing so that I know there is no resentment or anger between us!</t6775> <t6776>Then I will get out of your way.</t6776><t6777>"</t6777>
<t6778>Kind-hearted Miss Pross! She acted as if she were the reason for the coldness between them.</t6778> <t6779>As if Mr. Lorry didn't know the fact that years ago this dear brother had squandered all of Miss Pross's money and fled from the quiet corner in Soho!</t6779>
<t6780>Finally, Solomon uttered a few words of affection, but he did so with a spiteful condescension that was excessive, even though familial values and roles had been reversed (yet this was the case everywhere in the world), and at that moment, Mr. Cruncher, unexpectedly intervening, touched Solomon's shoulder and said to him in a gruff voice;</t6780>
<t6781>"Hey, can I ask you something?</t6781> <t6782>Is your name John Solomon or Solomon John?</t6782><t6783>"</t6783>
<t6784>The officer turned to him with sudden suspicion.</t6784> <t6785>Not a single word had come out of his mouth before.</t6785>
<t6786>"Come on!" said Mr. Cruncher.</t6786> <t6787>"Speak up, have you lost your tongue?" (He couldn't do more on his own anyway.</t6787><t6788>) "Is it John Solomon or Solomon John?</t6788> <t6789>He calls you Solomon and since he is your brother, he must know it correctly.</t6789> <t6790>But I know your name as John.</t6790> <t6791>Which of these two names comes first now?</t6791> <t6792>The same goes for the name Pross.</t6792> <t6793>You weren't using this name on the other side, were you?</t6793><t6794>"</t6794>
<t6795>"What do you mean?</t6795><t6796>"</t6796>
<t6797>"Honestly, I don't know what I mean either, because I can't remember which name you used in England."</t6797><t6798>"</t6798>
<t6799>"Don't you really remember?</t6799><t6800>"</t6800>
<t6801>"I don't remember.</t6801> <t6802>But I'm sure it was a two-syllable name.</t6802><t6803>"</t6803>
<t6804>"Is that so?</t6804><t6805>"</t6805>
<t6806>"It is so.</t6806> <t6807>The other was a single syllable.</t6807> <t6808>I know you.</t6808> <t6809>You are the spy witness in Bailey.</t6809> <t6810>In the name of the god of liars, who is probably your father, what was your name back then?</t6810><t6811>"</t6811>
<t6812>"Barsad," someone interrupted.</t6812>
<t6813>"This is the name of the thousand-pound man!" shouted Jerry.</t6813>
<t6814>The man who joined the conversation was Sydney Carton.</t6814> <t6815>He stood with his hands clasped behind his rider's jacket, right next to Mr. Cruncher's elbow, with an indifferent attitude as if he were in the Old Bailey court.</t6815>
<t6816>"Don't be afraid, dear Miss Pross.</t6816> <t6817>I went to see Mr. Lorry last evening, he was very surprised; we decided that it would be best for me to stay out of sight until everything is settled or until I can be of some help; I came here to have a short conversation with your brother.</t6817> <t6818>I wish your brother had a better job than Mr. Barsad.</t6818> <t6819>I felt sorry on your behalf that your brother is a jailbird.</t6819><t6820>"</t6820>
<t6821>Kuzu, in those times, was a slang term used by guards for spies.</t6821> <t6822>The pale-faced spy's face turned even paler, and he asked with what courage he spoke to him like that.</t6822>
<t6823>"I will tell you," said Sydney.</t6823> <t6824>"Mr. Barsad, about an hour ago, while I was lost in thought by the walls of the Conciergerie Prison, I saw you coming out of there.</t6824> <t6825>You have an unforgettable face, and I do not forget a face I have seen.</t6825> <t6826>I was indeed surprised to see you there, and as you know, I thought you might have something to do with the misfortunes that have befallen our extremely unfortunate friend, so I followed you.</t6826> <t6827>I entered this wine shop right behind you and sat next to you.</t6827> <t6828>It was not at all difficult to understand what kind of work you do from your frank conversations and the rumors circulating among your admirers.</t6828> <t6829>Then, what I started by chance turned into a specific purpose, Mr. Barsad.</t6829><t6830>"</t6830>
<t6831>"What is the purpose?" asked the spy.</t6831>
<t6832>"It wouldn't be appropriate to explain this in the middle of the street; it could be dangerous.</t6832> <t6833>For instance, could we talk for a few minutes, privately, at Tellson's Bank?</t6833><t6834>"</t6834>
<t6835>"Is this a threat?"</t6835>
<t6836>"Ah! Did I ever say such a thing?</t6836><t6837>"</t6837>
<t6838>"Then why should I go?"</t6838><t6839>"</t6839>
<t6840>"Honestly, Mr. Barsad, I cannot say that."</t6840><t6841>"</t6841>
<t6842>"So, are you not going to tell me even then, sir?" the spy asked hesitantly.</t6842>
<t6843>"You have understood me very well, Mr. Barsad.</t6843> <t6844>Yes, I will not tell you!</t6844><t6845>"</t6845>
<t6846>In contrast to the man's irritability and resourcefulness, Carton's indifferent and reckless demeanor was sufficient both for what he had in mind and to deal with this man.</t6846> <t6847>His experienced eyes had seen this situation and acknowledged it.</t6847>
<t6848>Throwing a reproachful look at his sister, the spy said, "I'm telling you, if anything bad happens to me, it's your fault."</t6848><t6849>"</t6849>
<t6850>"Come, come Mr. Barsad!" shouted Sydney.</t6850> <t6851>"Don't be ungrateful.</t6851> <t6852>If I didn't have so much respect for your sister, I wouldn't be able to talk so comfortably about my little proposal, which I think would satisfy both of us.</t6852> <t6853>Are you coming to the bank with me now?</t6853><t6854>"</t6854>
<t6855>"I was curious about what you wanted to say.</t6855> <t6856>Yes, I am coming with you.</t6856><t6857>"</t6857>
<t6858>"First of all, I suggest taking your sister safely to the corner of her own street.</t6858> <t6859>Take my arm, Miss Pross.</t6859> <t6860>It is not good for you to be outside unprotected at this time, in this city; moreover, since your companion knows Mr. Barsad, I also invite him to join Mr. Lorry.</t6860> <t6861>Is everyone ready?</t6861> <t6862>Then let's go!</t6862><t6863>"</t6863>
<t6864>When Miss Pross, holding onto Sydney's arm and looking at his face, pleaded with him not to harm Solomon, she would remember very shortly and even for the rest of her life, the determined strength in his arm and the inspiration in his eyes that not only contradicted his indifferent demeanor but also transformed and elevated him.</t6864> <t6865>Miss Pross was very afraid for her brother, who was not at all deserving of her love, and it could not be said that she heeded Sydney's friendly advice.</t6865>
<t6866>They left Miss Pross at the corner of her street, and Carton headed towards Mr. Lorry's place, which was a few minutes' walk away.</t6866> <t6867>John Barsad or Solomon Pross was also walking alongside him.</t6867>
<t6868>Mr. Lorry had just finished his dinner and was sitting in front of a few pieces of wood burning in the fireplace – perhaps seeing in the glow of the fire the young clerk of Tellson's watching the embers at the Royal George Hotel in Dover years ago.</t6868> <t6869>As they entered, Mr. Lorry turned his head towards them and was surprised to see a stranger with them.</t6869>
<t6870>"Sir, this gentleman is Miss Pross's brother," said Sydney, "Mr. Barsad."</t6870><t6871>"</t6871>
<t6872>The old man repeated, "Barsad?"</t6872> <t6873>"Barsad? I remember this name from somewhere – and the face too.</t6873><t6874>"</t6874>
<t6875>Carton said with an insolent manner, "I told you that you have an unforgettable face, Mr. Barsad."</t6875> <t6876>"Please sit down.</t6876><t6877>"</t6877>
<t6878>As Carton pulled up a chair for himself, he frowned and gave Mr. Lorry the answer he wanted, "The witness at the trial." Mr. Lorry immediately remembered the man and scrutinized his new visitor with evident disdain.</t6878>
<t6879>"Mr. Barsad is Miss Pross's dear brother, you must have heard," said Sydney, "and he himself confirmed this relationship.</t6879> <t6880>Now I move on to the bad news.</t6880> <t6881>Darnay has been arrested again.</t6881><t6882>"</t6882>
<t6883>The old man, frozen by this news, exclaimed, "What are you saying?</t6883> <t6884>Just two hours ago, when I left him, he was safe and free, and I was about to go to him now!"</t6884>
<t6885>"How did they arrest him?</t6885> <t6886>When did this happen, Mr. Barsad?"</t6886>
<t6887>"I think just now.</t6887><t6888>"</t6888>
<t6889>"Mr. Barsad is the most knowledgeable person on this matter, sir," said Sydney, "I heard about this issue, that is, Darnay's arrest, while Mr. Barsad was drinking wine and talking with a friend and another fellow brother.</t6889> <t6890>He left the messengers at the door, then saw them coming in.</t6890> <t6891>There is no doubt that he has been arrested again.</t6891><t6892>"</t6892>
<t6893>Mr. Lorry's businesslike eyes read on the speaker's face that dwelling further on this subject would be a waste of time.</t6893> <t6894>He was bewildered but aware that he needed to gather his thoughts, so he composed himself and listened quietly.</t6894>
<t6895>"If you ask me," Sydney said to him, "Doctor Manette's name and reputation might be useful again tomorrow –you mentioned that he would appear in court again tomorrow, didn't you Mr. Barsad?</t6895><t6896>"</t6896>
<t6897>"Yes, I think so."</t6897><t6898>"</t6898>
<t6899>"It might work, of course.</t6899> <t6900>But it might not work either.</t6900> <t6901>To tell the truth, Mr. Lorry, I am very worried that Doctor Manette's influence cannot prevent this arrest.</t6901><t6902>"</t6902>
<t6903>"Maybe he didn't know about this," said Mr. Lorry.</t6903>
<t6904>"That's the worst part, after all, everyone knows how much he is identified with his son-in-law.</t6904><t6905>"</t6905>
<t6906>With his nervous hands on his chin and his nervous eyes again on Carton, Mr. Lorry accepted, saying, "You are right."</t6906>
<t6907>"In short," said Sydney, "this is a desperate time where desperate games are played for desperate stakes.</t6907> <t6908>Let the Doctor play to win, I will play to lose.</t6908> <t6909>In this environment, no one's life has any value.</t6909> <t6910>Today, a man carried home on shoulders can be condemned to death the next day.</t6910> <t6911>Now, as a last resort, I will put forward a friend from the Conciergerie as a trump card.</t6911> <t6912>The person I am determined to win over is Mr. Barsad.</t6912><t6913>"</t6913>
<t6914>"For that, you need to have very good cards, sir," replied the spy.</t6914>
<t6915>"I will reveal it soon.</t6915> <t6916>First, let me fully see what I have.</t6916> <t6917>Mr. Lorry, you know what a miserable man I am.</t6917> <t6918>Could you give me some brandy?" They placed the brandy in front of him, and he drank it in one gulp – then another – then pushed the bottle aside thoughtfully.</t6918>
<t6919>As if he really had cards in his hand and was looking at them, he continued his speech, "Mr. Barsad, the prison lamb, spy of the Republican committees, sometimes a guard, sometimes a prisoner, but always a spy and informant, much more valuable here because he is English, as he does not arouse much suspicion in inciting perjury compared to a Frenchman and introduces himself to his superiors with a pseudonym.</t6919> <t6920>This is a very good card.</t6920> <t6921>Mr. Barsad, who is currently working on behalf of the Republican French government, previously worked on behalf of the aristocratic English government, which was an enemy of France and freedom.</t6921> <t6922>This is an excellent card.</t6922> <t6923>In all this atmosphere of suspicion, it is as clear as day that Mr. Barsad, who still works on behalf of the aristocratic English government, is Pitt's spy, an enemy traitor nestled in the heart of the Republic, and the ever-mentioned but never-found English traitor and representative of all kinds of treachery.</t6923> <t6924>This trump card can never be beaten.</t6924> <t6925>Could you see the cards I have, Mr. Barsad?</t6925><t6926>"</t6926>
<t6927>A bit uneasy, the spy replied, "I can't say that I understand your game."</t6927>
<t6928>"I am playing Asım, the nearest regional committee has been informed by Mr. Barsad.</t6928> <t6929>You also take a look at your hand, Mr. Barsad, what do you see?</t6929> <t6930>But don't rush.</t6930><t6931>"</t6931>
<t6932>Carton pulled the bottle and filled another glass with cognac, drinking it in one gulp.</t6932> <t6933>The spy saw that Carton was afraid he would report him immediately, that he would drink it in one gulp like that.</t6933> <t6934>Noticing this, Carton filled another one and downed it.</t6934>
<t6935>"Look carefully at your hand, Mr. Barsad.</t6935> <t6936>Think carefully.</t6936><t6937>"</t6937>
<t6938>Barsad's hand was worse than he had anticipated.</t6938> <t6939>Mr. Barsad saw that he was losing the cards in this hand, about which Sydney Carton knew nothing, one by one.</t6939> <t6940>He had been dismissed from his honorable job in England—not because he was unwanted there, but because our pride in secrecy and espionage coincides with recent times—due to too much perjury, and he had crossed the Channel to accept the job in France.</t6940> <t6941>At first, he had engaged in incitement and spying among his own citizens, and then gradually tried the same activities among the French.</t6941> <t6942>Carton knew that he had been spying in the St. Antoine district and in Defarge's wine shop under the orders of the overthrown government; to establish dialogue with the Defarges, he had gathered information about Dr. Manette's imprisonment, release, and life from vigilant police officers, then used this information against Madame Defarge but had achieved nothing.</t6942> <t6943>He shuddered with fear, recalling how the dreadful woman always knitted while talking to him and how she glared at him menacingly as her fingers moved.</t6943> <t6944>He had seen her many times later in St. Antoine, the woman constantly reading the names she knitted into her work, and the lives of these people she denounced soon ended at the guillotine.</t6944> <t6945>As everyone involved in these matters knew, he was never safe; escape was impossible; he was tightly bound under the shadow of the blade, and despite all the treachery and betrayal he had committed to contribute to the surrounding savagery, a single word could cause that blade to fall on his head.</t6945> <t6946>With things in this state, once a denunciation was made, that dreadful woman, whose ruthlessness he had witnessed many times, could bring out her deadly records and ruin his life.</t6946> <t6947>Moreover, men involved in such secret affairs are quickly terrified, and there were cards in this hand that, when revealed, would inevitably cause the holder to turn pale.</t6947>
<t6948>"It seems you are not very satisfied with your own hand," said Sydney with great composure.</t6948> <t6949>"Shall we continue the game?</t6949><t6950>"</t6950>
<t6951>"I think it's ongoing, sir," said the spy, turning to Mr. Lorry, "It would actually be good to get the opinion of an experienced and helpful gentleman like yourself. Can this gentleman, who is much younger than you, really play the card he mentioned?"</t6951> <t6952>"I admit that I am a spy and that it is a disgraceful situation – but someone has to do it; however, why does this gentleman lower himself by pretending to be a spy when he is not one?"</t6952><t6953>"</t6953>
<t6954>"I will play the ace I have, Mr. Barsad," said Carton, who took the remark personally, and looking at his watch, he added, "without any hesitation, in a little while."</t6954>
<t6955>The spy, trying to draw Mr. Lorry into the conversation, replied, "Out of respect for my sister from two such courteous gentlemen like yourselves...</t6955><t6956>"</t6956>
<t6957>"I cannot better prove my respect for your sister than by finally freeing her from her brother," said Sydney Carton.</t6957>
<t6958>"So, this is what you think, sir?</t6958><t6959>"</t6959>
<t6960>"My decision on this matter is final.</t6960><t6961>"</t6961>
<t6962>Barsad was so affected by the spy's calm demeanor, which was completely at odds with his flashy yet coarse clothing, and perhaps by his ordinary behavior, that he was left bewildered, not knowing what to do. This mysteriousness of Carton – which was an enigma even for men much wiser and more honest than him – left Barsad in a state of confusion.</t6962> <t6963>While he was in this state of not knowing what to say, Carton, adopting the manner of a man arranging his cards, said:</t6963>
<t6964>"Actually, now that I think about it again, I realized I had one more good card in my hand, which I hadn't noticed before.</t6964> <t6965>You know, that guy and his prison lamb friend who said he grazed in many prisons; who was that?</t6965><t6966>"</t6966>
<t6967>"The French one.</t6967> <t6968>You wouldn't know him," the spy quickly replied.</t6968>
<t6969>"French, huh!" Carton repeated, lost in thought and seemingly unaware of her, yet he had echoed the exact word she had said.</t6969> <t6970>"Well, it could be, of course.</t6970><t6971>"</t6971>
<t6972>"Yes, you can be sure," said the spy; "but it doesn't matter.</t6972><t6973>"</t6973>
<t6974>"But it doesn't matter," repeated Carton in the same mechanical manner –"but it doesn't matter–</t6974> <t6975>No, it doesn't matter at all.</t6975> <t6976>It doesn't.</t6976> <t6977>But I know it.</t6977><t6978>"</t6978>
<t6979>"Sanmam.</t6979> <t6980>I'm not sure about this.</t6980> <t6981>It can't be," said the spy.</t6981>
<t6982>"Un-be-liev-able," murmured Sydney Carton, in the same manner as before, and refilled his glass (fortunately, this time it was a small one).</t6982> <t6983>"Un-be-liev-able.</t6983> <t6984>His French was good.</t6984> <t6985>But it sounded foreign to me.</t6985><t6986>"</t6986>
<t6987>"Provincial," said the spy.</t6987>
<t6988>Carton, as if a lightning bolt had struck his mind, slammed his hand on the table and said, "No.</t6988> <t6989>It was a stranger!" he shouted.</t6989> <t6990>"Cly! He had hidden his face, but it was the same man.</t6990> <t6991>He was standing right in front of us at Old Bailey.</t6991><t6992>"</t6992>
<t6993>With a smile that made the curve of his nose more pronounced to one side, "Now you have rushed a bit, sir," said Barsad, "you have given me an advantage."</t6993> <t6994>Of course, I admit that he was once my partner, but Cly has been dead for a long time.</t6994> <t6995>I was even with him during his illness.</t6995> <t6996>He was buried in the garden of Saint Pancras Church in London.</t6996> <t6997>Since he was not a man much favored among that blasphemous crowd, I couldn't attend his funeral, but I helped put him in the coffin."</t6997> <t6998>Meanwhile, Mr. Lorry, from where he was sitting, noticed a shadow on the wall that distinctly resembled that of a goblin.</t6998> <t6999>Upon looking carefully, he realized that it was formed by Mr. Cruncher's hair standing even more upright than usual.</t6999>
<t7000>"We need to be reasonable," said the spy, "and fair.</t7000> <t7001>To show you how wrong you are and how unfounded these claims are, I will show you Cly's burial certificate, which I carry in my notebook," he said, taking it out and opening it with hurried hands, "luckily, it has been with me since then.</t7001> <t7002>Here it is.</t7002> <t7003>Go ahead, look, read it!</t7003> <t7004>You can take it; it's not fake.</t7004><t7005>"</t7005>
<t7006>Mr. Lorry now noticed that the reflection on the wall had lengthened; Mr. Cruncher had gotten up and was approaching them.</t7006> <t7007>In this house that Jack built, even if he had horns of a cow on his head, his hair could not look this wild.</t7007>
<t7008>Mr. Cruncher, standing over the unsuspecting spy like a ghostly bailiff, touched his shoulder. "So, Roger Cly, your master, is dead," said Mr. Cruncher, with a silent and steely expression.</t7008> <t7009>"Did you put him in the coffin?</t7009><t7010>"</t7010>
<t7011>"Yes.</t7011><t7012>"</t7012>
<t7013>"Well, then who took him out of there?</t7013><t7014>"</t7014>
<t7015>Barsad leaned back in his chair and stammered, "What do you mean?</t7015><t7016>"</t7016>
<t7017>"So," said Mr. Cruncher, "he actually never got into that coffin.</t7017> <t7018>No! He wasn't! If he did, they can cut off my head.</t7018><t7019>"</t7019>
<t7020>Casus looked at the two gentlemen beside him; both were staring at Jerry in a bewildered state.</t7020>
<t7021>"In that coffin," said Jerry, "you had only put cobblestones and dirt.</t7021> <t7022>Don't tell me you buried Cly.</t7022> <t7023>This was a trick.</t7023> <t7024>Two other people and I know this.</t7024><t7025>"</t7025>
<t7026>"How do you know?</t7026><t7027>"</t7027>
<t7028>"What's it to you? Oh my God!" muttered Mr. Cruncher, "I already have an old grudge against you for those miserable taxes you collect from all the tradesmen!"</t7028> <t7029>"I'll strangle you right here for half a guinea." Sydney Carton, who was as bewildered by the turn of events as Mr. Lorry, at this point asked Mr. Cruncher to calm down and explain the situation.</t7029>
<t7030>"Another time, sir," Mr. Cruncher replied evasively, "this is not the right time to explain."</t7030> <t7031>"What I mean to say is that he knows very well that Cly is not in that coffin."</t7031> <t7032>"If he says otherwise, I'll either strangle him on the spot," Mr. Cruncher offered this quite generously, "or I'll go and report him immediately."</t7032><t7033>"</t7033>
<t7034>"Hmm! There is just one thing," said Carton.</t7034> <t7035>"I have one more card in my hand, Mr. Barsad.</t7035> <t7036>In this agitated Paris, where suspicion is everywhere, it is quite a mysterious situation for you to have a connection with an aristocratic spy with a similar past as yours, and for this person to come back to life after a fake death.</t7036> <t7037>It is hardly possible for you to stay away from being informed!</t7037> <t7038>A foreigner playing a game against the Republic in the prisons.</t7038> <t7039>A strong card – definitely a guillotine card!</t7039> <t7040>Shall we continue the game?</t7040><t7041>"</t7041>
<t7042>"No!" said the spy.</t7042> <t7043>"Alright, I'll tell you.</t7043> <t7044>In that maddened crowd, we had so little space that I risked death and fled from England; as for Cly, he was so trapped that if we hadn't turned that cabinet, he would never have escaped.</t7044> <t7045>But what I'm curious about is how this man learned that it was a game.</t7045><t7046>"</t7046>
<t7047>The combative Mr. Cruncher replied harshly, "Don't waste your thoughts on that man, you'll already have enough trouble dealing with this gentleman."</t7047> <t7048>One more thing!</t7048> <t7049>I'm telling you again!" –Mr. Cruncher once again flaunted his generosity–</t7049> <t7050>"I'll choke and strangle you!</t7050><t7051>"</t7051>
<t7052>The prison turnkey then turned to Sydney Carton and said more resolutely, "We are at a certain point now.</t7052> <t7053>Soon I will return to my work, I can't stay here any longer.</t7053> <t7054>You said you had a proposal for me; what is it?</t7054> <t7055>Don't ask me for something I can't do.</t7055> <t7056>If you ask for something that would put my head in danger, of course, I can't agree to that.</t7056> <t7057>In short, I must make this choice.</t7057> <t7058>You are talking to me about despair.</t7058> <t7059>We are all desperate here.</t7059> <t7060>Remember! If we think about it, I can also report you and swear falsely to get out of those stone walls, as can others.</t7060> <t7061>Now tell me, what do you want from me?</t7061><t7062>"</t7062>
<t7063>"It's not much.</t7063> <t7064>You are a guard at the Conciergerie, aren't you?</t7064><t7065>"</t7065>
<t7066>"I'm telling you for the first and last time, it's impossible to escape from there," said the spy with a firm attitude.</t7066>
<t7067>"Why are you telling me something I didn't ask you about?</t7067> <t7068>Are you a guard at the Conciergerie?</t7068><t7069>"</t7069>
<t7070>"Yes, sometimes.</t7070><t7071>"</t7071>
<t7072>"Can you do this whenever you want?</t7072><t7073>"</t7073>
<t7074>"I can come and go as I please."</t7074><t7075>"</t7075>
<t7076>Sydney Carton filled another glass of cognac, then slowly poured it onto the base of the fireplace and watched it spill.</t7076> <t7077>When it was all over, he stood up and said:</t7077>
<t7078>"Up until now, we have spoken in front of these two people because the value of our cards needed to be known by others as well.</t7078> <t7079>Now, come to that dark room so we can talk alone about my final words.</t7079><t7080>"</t7080>
<t7081>IX</t7081>
<t7082>The Game Begins</t7082>
<t7083>While Sydney Carton and the prison lamb were talking in the dark room next door, in a voice so low that no one could hear, Mr. Lorry looked at Jerry with evident suspicion and distrust.</t7083> <t7084>The response of this honest tradesman to these looks was not very reassuring either; he was frequently shifting his legs as if he had forty of them and was trying each one; he was examining his nails with quite a suspicious interest, and whenever he made eye contact with Mr. Lorry, he would cover his mouth with his hand as if struck by a strange coughing fit, which could not be seen as a very honest behavior.</t7084>
<t7085>"Jerry," said Mr. Lorry.</t7085> <t7086>"Come here."</t7086><t7087>"</t7087>
<t7088>Mr. Cruncher came over, standing with one shoulder forward.</t7088>
<t7089>"What do you do besides carrying news?</t7089><t7090>"</t7090>
<t7091>After thinking for a bit and looking carefully at his boss, Mr. Cruncher finally came up with the brilliant idea to say, "I am engaged in farming."</t7091>
<t7092>"This matter has upset me," said Mr. Lorry, shaking his index finger at him angrily, "because you have engaged in disgraceful illegal activities hiding behind the respectable and grand bank of Tellson.</t7092> <t7093>Don't think that I will help you when you return to England.</t7093> <t7094>Don't ever think that I will keep this secret.</t7094> <t7095>Tellson can never be misused in such a way.</t7095><t7096>"</t7096>
<t7097>Mr. Cruncher, whose face turned red with shame, began to plead, "I hope, sir," he said, "that a gentleman like you, whom I have had the honor of working for until my hair turned gray, would think twice before harming me, even if I did such a thing, not that I am saying I did, but if I had."</t7097> <t7098>And if I had done it, there would be an explanation for it.</t7098> <t7099>One must look at it from both sides.</t7099> <t7100>Right now, while doctors are filling their pockets with guineas, an honest tradesman might be shooting at a penny –not a single penny going into his pocket!</t7100> <t7101>Nothing at all, not even half a penny –penniless men!</t7101> <t7102>No, not even a quarter penny –while those men are slipping in and out of Tellson's like they are looting from a fire, giving the honest tradesman a sidelong glance as they pass by, getting into their carriages, getting out of their carriages –ah! just like looting from a fire.</t7102> <t7103>Aren't they using Tellson's too?</t7103> <t7104>These things should not be overlooked.</t7104> <t7105>I have a wife, I mean I had one when I was in England, and I hope I will have one in the future, a woman who prays morning and night, to the point of being tiresome –and what prayers!</t7105> <t7106>But they, they don't even compare to the doctors' wives –have you ever seen them?</t7106> <t7107>Or if they do pray, it's for more patients to come, so how can you fully understand one side without looking at the other?</t7107> <t7108>Then even if that were the case, among all those undertakers, church clerks, gravediggers, and private guards (by the way, they are all greedy and all involved in it), what falls to men like us?</t7108> <t7109>So even if a person deals with such things, he doesn't get much out of it, Mr. Lorry.</t7109> <t7110>He sees no benefit; and once he gets involved, if he could foresee it, he would always want to get out of this path –I mean, if I had done it, that's how it would be.</t7110><t7111>"</t7111>
<t7112>"Off!" shouted Mr. Lorry, though he had softened a bit.</t7112> <t7113>"I am amazed as I look at you.</t7113><t7114>"</t7114>
<t7115>"Now sir, the thing that I will presumptuously propose to you," continued Mr. Cruncher, "even if there were such a thing, which I am not saying there is...</t7115><t7116>"</t7116>
<t7117>"Don't drag it out," said Mr. Lorry.</t7117>
<t7118>"No, I'm not prolonging it," replied Mr. Cruncher as if he were just about to express exactly what was on his mind or his proposal –"I'm not saying that –but if that's the case, what I would presumptuously offer you, sir, is this: Over there on the stool, you know the boy sitting by the Bar, that's my son, he's hardworking, he's good, if you want, he can do your errands, carry letters, handle your daily small tasks.</t7118> <t7119>If that's the case, which I still say it isn't (because I don't want to prolong the matter, sir), let that boy take his father's place and look after his mother; have pity on that boy's father –don't do it, sir– and let his father become an ordinary gravedigger and give up grave robbing –if this is true– and with this wish and belief, he would honor and protect the future of the dead, how wonderful.</t7119> <t7120>That's my offer to you, Mr. Lorry," said Mr. Cruncher, wiping his forehead with his arm as if to indicate he had reached the end of his speech, "that was my offer, sir.</t7120> <t7121>People don't ever think about the terrible things happening around them, just look, citizens with their heads chopped off, oh there are so many of them, porters are everywhere.</t7121> <t7122>That's what I would have to say, if the situation were as you said, I would beg you not to forget what I said and I would do it all for a good cause, otherwise, I might not have said any of this at all.</t7122><t7123>"</t7123>
<t7124>"At least this is true," said Mr. Lorry.</t7124> <t7125>"Don't say anything else anymore.</t7125> <t7126>If this is what you deserve and you show your remorse through your actions – not just words – I might be able to help you.</t7126> <t7127>Don't say anything else anymore.</t7127><t7128>"</t7128>
<t7129>Mr. Cruncher was rubbing his forehead with his fingers when Sydney Carton and the spy came from the dark room.</t7129> <t7130>"Adieu Mr. Barsad," said Carton; "now that we have an agreement, you have no reason to fear me.</t7130><t7131>"</t7131>
<t7132>She sat in a chair next to the fireplace, directly across from Mr. Lorry.</t7132> <t7133>When they were alone, Mr. Lorry asked her what she was doing.</t7133>
<t7134>"There isn't much.</t7134> <t7135>If the prisoner gets into trouble, I said I would make sure he is reached.</t7135><t7136>"</t7136>
<t7137>Mr. Lorry's face fell.</t7137>
<t7138>"This is all I can do," said Carton.</t7138> <t7139>"Asking for more would mean putting the man's head under the guillotine, and as he said, being reported would be his end.</t7139> <t7140>That's what makes it difficult.</t7140> <t7141>There's nothing to be done.</t7141><t7142>"</t7142>
<t7143>"But if things go wrong before the trial," said Mr. Lorry, "reaching him won't be enough to save him."</t7143><t7144>"</t7144>
<t7145>"I didn't say we could save it either.</t7145><t7146>"</t7146>
<t7147>Mr. Lorry's gaze slowly drifted towards the fire; his love for the one and only Lucie and the heavy disappointment brought by this second arrest had weakened him; now he was an old man, crushed under the weight of recent troubles, drowned in tears.</t7147>
<t7148>"You are a good man and a true friend," said Carton, in a different tone of voice.</t7148> <t7149>"Forgive me for giving you such bad news.</t7149> <t7150>If I saw my father crying, I couldn't sit idly by, and if you were my father, I couldn't show more respect to your sorrow than I do now.</t7150> <t7151>But fortunately, you have not had the misfortune of being my father.</t7151><t7152>"</t7152>
<t7153>Despite saying his final words in his usual manner, there was a sincere feeling and respect both in his tone of voice and in his touch, and Mr. Lorry, who had never seen this good side of him before, was completely caught off guard.</t7153> <t7154>He extended his hand to him, and Carton gently shook it.</t7154>
<t7155>"Returning to poor Darnay," said Carton.</t7155> <t7156>"Do not mention this meeting or this arrangement to his wife.</t7156> <t7157>This will not enable her to see her husband.</t7157> <t7158>She might think that this plan, at worst, was made to bring the necessary things for him to carry out his own execution." Mr. Lorry had never thought of this and quickly looked at Carton to see if such a thing had occurred to him.</t7158> <t7159>It seemed it had; this was plainly evident from Carton's expression.</t7159>
<t7160>"Thousands of things might come to Lucie's mind," said Carton, "and each one of them would only increase her distress.</t7160> <t7161>Do not mention me to her.</t7161> <t7162>As I said when I first came, it is better if I do not see her.</t7162> <t7163>I can do everything I can without seeing her.</t7163> <t7164>You are going to her now, aren't you?</t7164> <t7165>She must be in a wretched state tonight.</t7165><t7166>"</t7166>
<t7167>"Now I will go directly to him."</t7167><t7168>"</t7168>
<t7169>"I'm glad to hear that.</t7169> <t7170>He is very attached to you and trusts you.</t7170> <t7171>How does he look?</t7171><t7172>"</t7172>
<t7173>"Anxious and unhappy, but very beautiful.</t7173><t7174>"</t7174>
<t7175>"Ahh!"</t7175>
<t7176>It was a long and sorrowful sound, like a sigh – almost like a sob.</t7176> <t7177>Mr. Lorry turned his eyes to Carton, whose face was turned toward the fire, at the sound.</t7177> <t7178>On a bright sunny day, a light or shadow passed quickly over Carton's face, like a broken coin rolling downhill, and he extended his foot to push back a burning log that had rolled forward.</t7178> <t7179>He was wearing a white riding jacket, which was fashionable at the time, and long boots, and the light from the fire reflecting off his clothes made him look quite pale, while his long, disheveled brown hair was untied.</t7179> <t7180>Carton was so indifferent to the fire that Mr. Lorry couldn't help but warn him; for when the burning log broke under the weight of his foot, Carton's booted foot was still standing on its hot embers.</t7180>
<t7181>"I forgot," said Carton.</t7181>
<t7182>Mr. Lorry's eyes again drifted to the young man's face.</t7182> <t7183>He noticed the air of wasted potential that overshadowed his naturally handsome features and the expression on his face reminded him of the expressions on the faces of the prisoners he had recently seen.</t7183>
<t7184>Turning to him, Carton asked, "Have you finished your duties here, sir?"</t7184>
<t7185>"Yes.</t7185> <t7186>As I explained last night when Lucie arrived unexpectedly, I did everything I could here.</t7186> <t7187>I was hoping to leave Paris, leaving them here safely.</t7187> <t7188>I have my exit document.</t7188> <t7189>I was ready to go.</t7189><t7190>"</t7190>
<t7191>They were both silent.</t7191>
<t7192>"You are a person who has seen and experienced a lot, aren't you, sir?" said Carton thoughtfully.</t7192>
<t7193>"I am seventy-eight years old."</t7193><t7194>"</t7194>
<t7195>"Throughout your life, you have always done useful things; you have always worked; you have become a person whom everyone trusts, respects, and values, right?</t7195><t7196>"</t7196>
<t7197>"I have been a businessman for as long as I can remember.</t7197> <t7198>I can say that I was involved in the business world even as a child.</t7198><t7199>"</t7199>
<t7200>"Do you see, at seventy-eight years old, how much space you occupy in this world.</t7200> <t7201>There will be many people who will look for you in your absence.</t7201><t7202>"</t7202>
<t7203>"I am an old man with no one," replied Mr. Lorry, shaking his head from side to side.</t7203> <t7204>"There is no one to mourn for me."</t7204><t7205>"</t7205>
<t7206>"How can you say this?</t7206> <t7207>Doesn't Lucie cry for you?</t7207> <t7208>Doesn't her child cry too?</t7208><t7209>"</t7209>
<t7210>"Yes, yes, thank God they exist.</t7210> <t7211>That's not exactly what I meant.</t7211><t7212>"</t7212>
<t7213>"This is something to be thankful to God for, isn't it?</t7213><t7214>"</t7214>
<t7215>"Of course."</t7215><t7216>"</t7216>
<t7217>"If tonight you could turn to your lonely heart and honestly say, 'In this life, I have neither gained anyone's love, nor loyalty, nor gratitude, nor respect; I have not secured a compassionate place in any way; I have not done any good or been of any benefit to anyone that would be remembered!' this seventy-eight years would weigh upon you like a heavy curse; wouldn't it?</t7217><t7218>"</t7218>
<t7219>"You are right, Mr. Carton; it would probably be so.</t7219><t7220>"</t7220>
<t7221>Sydney turned her eyes back to the fire and after a few minutes of silence, she said:</t7221>
<t7222>"What I want to ask you is this: Does it feel like your childhood is far behind you?</t7222> <t7223>Do the days when you sat on your mother's lap seem very distant?</t7223><t7224>"</t7224>
<t7225>Mr. Lorry replied to Carton's emotional state as follows:</t7225>
<t7226>"Twenty years ago it seemed that way, yes; but at this stage of my life, no.</t7226> <t7227>Because I am getting closer to the end with each passing day, I am progressing towards the beginning by turning in a circle.</t7227> <t7228>It seems like a good method found to prepare ourselves for that long journey in a soft and calm manner.</t7228> <t7229>The revival of many memories that have been dormant for a long time makes my heart ache, many memories of my young and beautiful mother (while I am so old!) and of those days when the thing called the world had a completely different meaning for me and my mistakes did not matter.</t7229><t7230>"</t7230>
<t7231>"I can understand this feeling!" shouted Carton with sudden enthusiasm.</t7231> <t7232>"Well, do these make you feel any better?</t7232><t7233>"</t7233>
<t7234>"I guess."</t7234><t7235>"</t7235>
<t7236>Carton stood up to help Mr. Lorry put on his coat, ending the conversation, "But you," said the old man, returning to the subject again, "you are still young.</t7236><t7237>"</t7237>
<t7238>"True," said Carton.</t7238> <t7239>"I am not old, but the path I am on is not a good one for aging.</t7239> <t7240>Anyway, let's forget about me.</t7240><t7241>"</t7241>
<t7242>"Then let's forget about me as well," said Mr. Lorry.</t7242> <t7243>"Are you leaving?</t7243><t7244>"</t7244>
<t7245>"I will accompany you to Lucie's door.</t7245> <t7246>You know how aimless and restless I am.</t7246> <t7247>If I wander the streets too much, don't worry; I'll be in front of you again in the morning.</t7247> <t7248>Are you going to the trial tomorrow?</t7248><t7249>"</t7249>
<t7250>"Yes, unfortunately."</t7250><t7251>"</t7251>
<t7252>"I will be there too, but only as one of the crowd.</t7252> <t7253>My spy will find me a place.</t7253> <t7254>Take my arm, sir.</t7254><t7255>"</t7255>
<t7256>Mr. Lorry did as Carton said, and the two of them went down the stairs and out into the street.</t7256> <t7257>A few minutes later, they arrived at the place where Mr. Lorry was going.</t7257> <t7258>Carton left him there; but after lingering a bit nearby, he returned and touched the door when it closed.</t7258> <t7259>He had heard that Lucie went to the prison every day.</t7259> <t7260>"She must have come out from here," he said, looking around, "then turned and walked over these stones.</t7260> <t7261>Let me follow her steps.</t7261><t7262>"</t7262>
<t7263>When Carton arrived at La Force Prison, where Lucie had stood in front of hundreds of times, it was ten o'clock at night.</t7263> <t7264>A small, slight woodcutter had closed his shop and was smoking his pipe in front of his door.</t7264>
<t7265>When he saw the man looking at him with curious eyes, he stopped and said, "Good evening, citizen," said Sydney Carton.</t7265>
<t7266>"Good night, citizen.</t7266><t7267>"</t7267>
<t7268>"How is the Republic going?</t7268><t7269>"</t7269>
<t7270>"I guess you meant guillotine.</t7270> <t7271>Not bad.</t7271> <t7272>Sixty-three people went today.</t7272> <t7273>Soon we'll reach a hundred.</t7273> <t7274>Samson and his men sometimes complain of fatigue.</t7274> <t7275>Ha, ha, ha! What a strange man that Samson is.</t7275> <t7276>A true barber!</t7276><t7277>"</t7277>
<t7278>"Do you go to see him often?</t7278><t7279>"</t7279>
<t7280>"Shaving?</t7280> <t7281>Always.</t7281> <t7282>Every day.</t7282> <t7283>What a barber! Have you ever seen him at work?</t7283><t7284>"</t7284>
<t7285>"No, I have never seen it.</t7285><t7286>"</t7286>
<t7287>"When you have a group in your hand, you must go and see it.</t7287> <t7288>Imagine, citizen; while I finished two pipes, the man beheaded sixty-three people today!</t7288> <t7289>I'm saying without smoking two pipes.</t7289> <t7290>I swear on my honor!</t7290><t7291>"</t7291>
<t7292>As the grinning little man showed the pipe he was smoking to demonstrate how the executioner measured his speed, Carton felt such an unbearable urge to kill him right then and there that he turned around and walked away immediately.</t7292>
<t7293>"Even if you wear English clothes," said the sawyer, "you're not English, are you?</t7293><t7294>"</t7294>
<t7295>Carton stopped again and replied over his shoulder, "I am an Englishman."</t7295>
<t7296>"You speak like a French person.</t7296><t7297>"</t7297>
<t7298>"I used to be a student here.</t7298><t7299>"</t7299>
<t7300>"Ah, you are just like a Frenchman! Good night, Englishman."</t7300><t7301>"</t7301>
<t7302>"Good night, citizen.</t7302><t7303>"</t7303>
<t7304>Shouting after him, "But go and see that strange fellow," insisted the little man.</t7304> <t7305>"Don't forget to take a pipe with you!"</t7305>
<t7306>Sydney had not gone far when he stopped under a dim street lamp and wrote something on a small piece of paper with his pen.</t7306> <t7307>Then, with the steps of someone who knew the way well, he zigzagged through many dark and dirty streets –the streets were much dirtier than usual, because even the busiest avenues had not been cleaned during the Reign of Terror– and stopped in front of a pharmacy, whose owner was about to close the shop with his own hands.</t7307> <t7308>The owner of this tiny, obscure, and crooked shop on a winding and busy slope was a tiny, obscure, and crooked man.</t7308>
<t7309>He placed the small piece of paper in front of the citizen at the cardboard counter, saying good night to him as well.</t7309> <t7310>When the pharmacist read this, he said, "Wow!" and let out a soft whistle:</t7310>
<t7311>"Whew! Whew! Whew!"</t7311>
<t7312>Sydney Carton paid no attention to him, the pharmacist asked:</t7312>
<t7313>"Are these for you, citizen?</t7313><t7314>"</t7314>
<t7315>"For me.</t7315><t7316>"</t7316>
<t7317>"Put these in separate places, will you, citizen?</t7317> <t7318>You know what happens if you mix them up, right?</t7318><t7319>"</t7319>
<t7320>"I know very well."</t7320><t7321>"</t7321>
<t7322>The pharmacist prepared the requested items in small packages and gave them to Carton.</t7322> <t7323>He then placed them one by one into the inner pocket of his coat, paid, and walked out with confident steps.</t7323> <t7324>"Until tomorrow," he said, looking up at the moon, "there is nothing else to do.</t7324> <t7325>I can't sleep either.</t7325><t7326>"</t7326>
<t7327>While saying these things under the swiftly drifting clouds, Carton had neither a careless attitude nor a defiant manner.</t7327> <t7328>He had more the calmness of a weary man who had wandered the roads, overcome many hardships, lost his way but ultimately found it, and now saw the end of it.</t7328>
<t7329>Years ago, as a young man full of great promise, he had walked behind his father's coffin to the cemetery, standing out among his rivals.</t7329> <t7330>His mother had died many years before his father.</t7330> <t7331>With the moon and drifting clouds overhead, passing through heavy shadows as he moved along the dark streets, Carton recalled the sacred words spoken at his father's grave: "I am the resurrection and the life, said the Lord; whoever believes in me, even if he dies, shall live, and whoever lives and believes in me shall never die.</t7331><t7332>"</t7332>
<t7333>In a city ruled by the guillotine, alone at night, with the pain of sixty-three people sent to death that day and the agony of the victims in prisons waiting to be executed tomorrow, the next day, or the day after, weighing heavily on his heart, successive associations brought forth these words from the past, like the emergence of the rusty anchor of an old ship from the depths.</t7333> <t7334>He hadn't actually searched for them, but he found himself constantly repeating these words.</t7334>
<t7335>Sydney Carton looked with a dignified curiosity at the people visible in the lit windows, who would soon retire to rest and forget the surrounding horrors for a few tranquil hours; then at the towers of churches where no prayers were read anymore, and from which everyone fled due to their reaction to the charlatans, looters, and immoral people who had been masquerading as priests for years; at the distant cemeteries with signs reading "for eternal sleep" at their gates; at the prisons and the streets where people, having grown accustomed to groups of sixty being taken to their deaths by cart, could no longer conjure up any tragic ghost stories in front of the guillotine; and with the same dignified curiosity that gave his anger a brief respite every night, Sydney Carton crossed the Seine again to reach the brighter avenues of the city whose life and death he observed.</t7335>
<t7336>There weren't many cars around, because those who rode in cars aroused a lot of suspicion; therefore, nobility had hidden its head under red caps, put on clumsy shoes, and was progressing slowly and awkwardly.</t7336> <t7337>On the other hand, all the theaters were full, and as Carton passed by one of them, people cheerfully came out and went home chatting.</t7337> <t7338>In front of one of the theater doors, a mother and her daughter were standing, thinking about how to cross the muddy road.</t7338> <t7339>Carton picked up the child and carried her across, and before that timid arm let go of his neck, she asked for a kiss from him.</t7339>
<t7340>"I am the resurrection and the life," said God, "whoever believes in me, even if they die, will still live, and whoever lives and believes in me will never die.</t7340><t7341>"</t7341>
<t7342>Since the streets had become completely silent and the night had fallen with all its darkness, the words seemed to echo at his feet and then spread into the air.</t7342> <t7343>Carton was walking on one hand, and on the other, he was repeating these words in an extremely calm manner and at regular intervals; but these words never left his ear.</t7343>
<t7344>Sydney Carton stood on the bridge, listening to the waters hitting the river walls on the Paris island, where the dazzling chaos of houses and the cathedral shone brightly in the moonlight, as the night was about to end, the day came cold like a dead face looking from the sky.</t7344> <t7345>Then the night, along with the moon and stars, faded away; it was as if death had taken over the entire universe for a while.</t7345>
<t7346>When the sun rose with all its grandeur today, it seemed to have cast aside all those words and the night's troubles, warming the heart of Sydney with its bright lights.</t7346> <t7347>When she shielded her eyes and looked at them, it was as if a bridge of light formed between her and the sun, and the river below sparkled brilliantly.</t7347>
<t7348>The powerful current in the river, which was exceedingly fast, deep, and distinct, had become like a companion to him in the morning silence.</t7348> <t7349>Sydney, far from the houses, fell asleep on the riverbank under the sunlight and warmth after walking along this current for a while.</t7349> <t7350>When he woke up and got up, he lingered there a bit more, watching a whirlpool that was aimlessly turning, until the current swallowed it and carried it to the sea.</t7350> <t7351>–"Just like me!</t7351><t7352>"</t7352>
<t7353>Then, a boat with a sail faded like a dead leaf came into view, and after gliding in front for a while, it disappeared from sight.</t7353> <t7354>When the boat's traces on the water vanished, the prayer that sprang from Sydney's heart for the forgiveness of his own negligence and mistakes ended with these words, "I am the resurrection, I am the life."</t7354><t7355>"</t7355>
<t7356>When he returned, Mr. Lorry had left, and it was not at all difficult to guess where this kind-hearted man had gone.</t7356> <t7357>Sydney Carton drank a little coffee, ate some bread, and after washing up and putting on clean clothes, he went to the courthouse.</t7357>
<t7358>The black sheep, which many people avoided out of fear, had seated Sydney in a secluded corner amidst the crowd, filling the courtroom with great excitement and murmurs.</t7358> <t7359>Mr. Lorry and Doctor Manette were there.</t7359> <t7360>Lucie was also sitting right next to her father.</t7360>
<t7361>When her husband was brought in, Lucie looked at him with such supportive, encouraging, deep love and pain-laden compassion that color instantly returned to Charles's face, his eyes sparkled, and his heart skipped a beat.</t7361> <t7362>If at that moment someone had observed the effect of Lucie's gaze on Sydney Carton, they would have seen that it was exactly the same as Charles's reaction.</t7362>
<t7363>In the unjust court, there was no reasonable method or rule that allowed the defendants to speak.</t7363> <t7364>In any case, if all the laws, methods, and protocols had not been so monstrously abused, there would not have been such a revolution, yet the death-thirsty revolution, driven by feelings of vengeance, had swept them all away into the wind.</t7364>
<t7365>All eyes turned to the jury.</t7365> <t7366>They were all the same determined patriots and good republicans as yesterday, the day before, tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow.</t7366> <t7367>Among them, one man with a greedy expression, impatient and with fingers constantly roaming over his lips, stood out immediately, and the audience was immensely pleased with his demeanor.</t7367> <t7368>This bloodthirsty, cannibalistic-looking, and cruel jury member was Jacques Three from St. Antoine.</t7368> <t7369>The entire jury stood like dogs gathered to judge a deer.</t7369>
<t7370>All eyes turned to the five judges and the prosecutor.</t7370> <t7371>There was no positive atmosphere in that part today.</t7371> <t7372>Instead, something cruel, savage, and deadly was brewing there.</t7372> <t7373>Then they looked around at the thousands in the crowd, their eyes gleaming as if in approval, and nodded to each other before leaning forward tensely and giving their attention.</t7373>
<t7374>Charles Evremonde, known as Darnay, was released yesterday.</t7374> <t7375>On the same day, he was found guilty again and imprisoned.</t7375> <t7376>The indictment was delivered to him last night.</t7376> <t7377>He was accused and denounced as an enemy of the Republic and an aristocrat.</t7377> <t7378>He comes from a family of a cruel ruler, exiled due to the oppressions they inflicted on people despite their abolished privileges.</t7378> <t7379>Charles Evremonde, known as Darnay, is legally dead because of this exile decree.</t7379>
<t7380>What the prosecutor said was basically this.</t7380>
<t7381>The president asked whether the defendant was reported openly or secretly.</t7381>
<t7382>"Openly, Mr. President.</t7382><t7383>"</t7383>
<t7384>"Who did it?"</t7384><t7385>"</t7385>
<t7386>"Three people.</t7386> <t7387>Ernest Defarge, the wine-seller from St Antoine.</t7387><t7388>"</t7388>
<t7389>"Beautiful.</t7389><t7390>"</t7390>
<t7391>"Therese Defarge, his wife."</t7391><t7392>"</t7392>
<t7393>"Beautiful.</t7393><t7394>"</t7394>
<t7395>"And also Alexandre Manette, doctor."</t7395><t7396>"</t7396>
<t7397>A great commotion erupted in the salon, and in the midst of all this chaos, Doctor Manette, trembling with a pale face, suddenly stood up from where he was seated.</t7397>
<t7398>"Mr. President, this is unacceptable, I object to this fraud and deceit.</t7398> <t7399>You know that the accused person is my daughter's husband.</t7399> <t7400>My daughter and her loved ones are more precious to me than my own life.</t7400> <t7401>Who is this deceitful conspirator saying that I reported my own child's husband, where is this person?</t7401><t7402>"</t7402>
<t7403>"Citizen Manette, calm down.</t7403> <t7404>If you disobey the authority of the court, you will also be acting unlawfully.</t7404> <t7405>As for the people you mentioned being more precious than your life, for a good citizen, nothing can be more precious than the Republic.</t7405><t7406>"</t7406>
<t7407>After the president's scolding, a thunderous applause erupted.</t7407> <t7408>The president rang his bell and continued his speech with the same enthusiasm.</t7408>
<t7409>"If the Republic asks you to sacrifice your child, the only thing you should do is to sacrifice them.</t7409> <t7410>Now be silent and listen carefully to what I have to say!</t7410><t7411>"</t7411>
<t7412>The people in the salon applauded wildly again.</t7412> <t7413>Dr. Manette sat down, looking around and with trembling lips; his daughter snuggled closely next to him.</t7413> <t7414>The greedy man on the jury rubbed his hands and, as usual, brought his hand to his mouth.</t7414>
<t7415>When the sounds in the courtroom died down and he was sure his voice could be heard, Defarge spoke up and recounted the Doctor's imprisonment, how he was a small child working alongside him at the time of his incarceration, then the prisoner's release, and the state he was in when he was freed and brought to him.</t7415>
<t7416>"You played a significant role in the capture of the Bastille, didn't you, citizen?</t7416><t7417>"</t7417>
<t7418>"I think so.</t7418><t7419>"</t7419>
<t7420>At that moment, a woman in the crowd shouted in a shrill voice; "You were one of the most patriotic people there.</t7420> <t7421>Why don't you tell us?</t7421> <t7422>You were the artilleryman there that day, and when that damned fortress fell, you were among the first to enter.</t7422> <t7423>Patriots, that's the truth!</t7423><t7424>"</t7424>
<t7425>The person trying to steer the case with the enthusiastic approval of the audience was İntikam.</t7425> <t7426>The chairman rang the bell; but İntikam, further encouraged by those in the hall, shouted even more fervently, "That bell doesn't work on me!" and the crowd once again applauded wildly.</t7426>
<t7427>"Then tell the court what you did at the Bastille that day, citizen.</t7427><t7428>"</t7428>
<t7429>Defarge, sitting at the foot of the witness stand, looked towards his wife who was staring at him unblinkingly, and said, "The prisoner in question.</t7429> <t7430>I knew he was held in a cell known as One Hundred and Five, North Tower.</t7430> <t7431>He had told me this himself.</t7431> <t7432>During the days when he was making shoes and I was looking after him, if you asked his name, he would say One Hundred and Five, North Tower.</t7432> <t7433>On that day, when the cannon was fired, I decided to examine that cell when the Bastille fell.</t7433> <t7434>Then it fell.</t7434> <t7435>Accompanied by a guard and a citizen friend who is now on the Jury, we went up to the cell.</t7435> <t7436>I examined the cell thoroughly.</t7436> <t7437>One of the stones of the chimney had been removed and then replaced, and here I found a paper with something written on it.</t7437> <t7438>This is that paper.</t7438> <t7439>Later, I found and examined some writing samples of Doctor Manette.</t7439> <t7440>This was his writing.</t7440> <t7441>I am handing this paper containing Doctor Manette's writing to the President.</t7441><t7442>"</t7442>
<t7443>"Let the text be read.</t7443><t7444>"</t7444>
<t7445>Everyone held their breath, and while not a sound was heard in the hall, the defendant looked at his wife with loving eyes, and she only took her worried eyes off him to look at her father.</t7445> <t7446>While Doctor Manette's eyes were fixed on the person who would read the paper.</t7446> <t7447>Madame Defarge did not take her eyes off the defendant, Monsieur Defarge did not take his eyes off his wife whose face was beaming, and all other eyes were turned to the Doctor who saw none of this – the paper began to be read.</t7447>
<t7448>X</t7448>
<t7449>The Shadow's Form</t7449>
<t7450>Ben, Alexandre Manette, born in Beauvais, the unfortunate doctor who lived in Paris, am writing this sorrowful note in the gloomy cell of the Bastille in the last month of the year 1767.</t7450> <t7451>I am writing this note in stolen intervals, under very difficult conditions.</t7451> <t7452>To hide it, I have slowly and laboriously prepared a place in the wall of the chimney.</t7452> <t7453>Perhaps a compassionate hand will find it one day when I and my sufferings have turned to dust.</t7453>
<t7454>I am writing these words in the last month of my ten-year imprisonment, with great difficulty, by mixing soot and coal dust that I scraped from the chimney with blood and using a rusty iron tip to write.</t7454> <t7455>There is no hope left inside me anymore.</t7455> <t7456>From the symptoms that have recently emerged, I understand that losing my sanity is near, but I swear that right now my mind is fully intact – my memory is strong, even the details are vivid in my mind – and I am ready to account for all these recorded last words to humanity and to God on Judgment Day.</t7456>
<t7457>In the third week of December in the year 1757 (I believe it was the twenty-second), on a moonlit and cloudy night, in the freezing weather, I had gone for a walk to get some fresh air on a deserted quay an hour's distance from my home on the street of the Faculty of Medicine, by the banks of the Seine River, when I heard the sound of a rapidly approaching carriage from behind.</t7457> <t7458>As I stepped aside to give way so that it wouldn't run me over, a head leaned out of the carriage window and told the driver to stop.</t7458>
<t7459>The moment the driver managed to pull on the reins of his horse, the carriage stopped, and the same person called out to me by name.</t7459> <t7460>I responded in kind.</t7460> <t7461>The carriage had stopped a bit ahead of me, so by the time I reached them, the two gentlemen had already opened the carriage door and stepped out.</t7461> <t7462>I noticed that both of them were wrapped in cloaks, as if hiding from something.</t7462> <t7463>When they stood side by side next to the carriage door, I saw that they were both around my age, perhaps a bit younger, and that they resembled each other greatly in height, build, demeanor, voice, and (as far as I could see) facial features.</t7463>
<t7464>"Are you Doctor Manette?" said one.</t7464>
<t7465>"Yes, it's me.</t7465><t7466>"</t7466>
<t7467>"Isn't it Doctor Manette from Beauvais?" said the other; "you know, the one who was originally a surgeon and has gained fame in Paris over the last few years, young Doctor Manette?"</t7467>
<t7468>"Gentlemen," I said, "yes.</t7468> <t7469>I am Doctor Manette, about whom you have spoken so elegantly.</t7469><t7470>"</t7470>
<t7471>"First, we went to your house," said the first one, "but unfortunately, we couldn't find you there; they told us that you might have walked this way, so we came here hoping to catch you.</t7471> <t7472>Now, would you please get in the car?</t7472><t7473>"</t7473>
<t7474>They both had a commanding demeanor, and as they said these things, they moved to position me between the car door and themselves.</t7474> <t7475>They were armed.</t7475> <t7476>I was not.</t7476>
<t7477>"Gentlemen," I said, "excuse me, but I usually like to know in advance which person is honoring me by needing my help and what kind of ailment the patient has.</t7477><t7478>"</t7478>
<t7479>The response came from the second speaker.</t7479> <t7480>"Doctor, your patients are always distinguished individuals.</t7480> <t7481>As for the nature of the illness, based on our confidence in your skill, we know that when you see the patient, you will understand it much better than we could ever explain to you.</t7481> <t7482>This information should suffice.</t7482> <t7483>Now, would you please get in the car?</t7483><t7484>"</t7484>
<t7485>There was no choice but to submit; I got into the car silently.</t7485> <t7486>Both of them got in after me – the last one jumped into the car after lifting the step.</t7486> <t7487>The car turned around and sped off as quickly as it had come.</t7487>
<t7488>I'm writing this as it is.</t7488> <t7489>I have no doubt that this conversation is exactly word for word the same.</t7489> <t7490>Without allowing my mind to stray from the event, I am conveying everything exactly as it happened.</t7490> <t7491>Now, I will mark the end of this part, take a break from writing, and hide this paper in its secret place.</t7491>
<t7492>The car left the streets behind and passed through the northern exit gate, heading out onto the highway outside the city.</t7492> <t7493>After moving about two-thirds of a league from the barrier – at that moment, I couldn't estimate the distance exactly, but I paid attention later – the car left the highway and stopped in front of an isolated house.</t7493> <t7494>The three of us got out of the car and started walking, passing through the wet and soft path of a garden with a neglected fountain overflowing with water, until we reached the door of the house.</t7494> <t7495>Even though we rang the bell, it wasn't opened immediately, and after it was opened, one of my guides struck the man who opened the door in the face with the heavy riding glove in his hand.</t7495>
<t7496>I didn't find this behavior very strange, as I had often witnessed people being more infatuated with dogs than with ordinary humans.</t7496> <t7497>But the other man struck the person with his arm just as angrily and in the same manner; the brothers resembled each other so much in both appearance and behavior that it was only then that I realized they were twins.</t7497>
<t7498>As soon as we got out there at the outer door (the door was locked, but one of the brothers opened it and then locked it again), I heard the shouting coming from one of the rooms upstairs.</t7498> <t7499>I was directed straight to this room; with each step on the stairs, the screams grew louder; finally, I found in front of me a patient lying in bed, suffering from brain fever.</t7499>
<t7500>The patient was an extraordinarily beautiful woman and young; she was definitely not more than twenty years old.</t7500> <t7501>Her hair was disheveled and messy, and her arms were tied on both sides with sashes and handkerchiefs.</t7501> <t7502>I noticed that these bindings were parts of a man's clothing.</t7502> <t7503>One of them had the letter E and a coat of arms on a fringed scarf used for a ceremonial dress.</t7503>
<t7504>I saw this as soon as I began to examine the patient; because during all her restless thrashing, the poor woman had turned face down towards the edge of the bed and the tip of her scarf had entered her mouth; she seemed to be suffocating.</t7504> <t7505>My first task was to ease her breathing, and as I put the scarf aside, the embroidered crest on its corner caught my eye.</t7505>
<t7506>I gently turned him over, placed my hand on his chest to calm him down, and looked at his face.</t7506> <t7507>His eyes opened wide like saucers, and he frequently let out piercing screams that penetrated one's soul, muttering, "My husband, my father, my brother!"; then he counted to twelve and said, "Shh!"</t7507> <t7508>He paused for a moment to listen to his surroundings, then resumed the piercing screams, followed by again saying, "My husband, my father, my brother!" counting to twelve, and saying, "Shh!"</t7508> <t7509>There was no difference in either the sequence or the manner of these actions.</t7509> <t7510>He did not take any breaks except for the brief pause before saying those words.</t7510>
<t7511>"Since when has it been like this?" I asked.</t7511>
<t7512>To distinguish between the brothers, I will call one big and the other small; the one I call big, who is more authoritative, responded, "Since around this time last night."</t7512>
<t7513>"Does she have a husband, a father, and a brother?</t7513><t7514>"</t7514>
<t7515>"He/She has a sibling."</t7515><t7516>"</t7516>
<t7517>"Am I speaking with the sibling right now?</t7517><t7518>"</t7518>
<t7519>"No," replied the man with a sneer.</t7519>
<t7520>"Has something happened recently with the number twelve?</t7520><t7521>"</t7521>
<t7522>The little brother impatiently interrupted, "It's about twelve o'clock.</t7522><t7523>"</t7523>
<t7524>My hand is still on the patient's chest, "Look, gentlemen," I said, "you brought me here but it was of no use!</t7524> <t7525>If you had explained the situation, I would have come prepared accordingly.</t7525> <t7526>Now we will waste time.</t7526> <t7527>There is no place to find medicine in this desolate area.</t7527><t7528>'"</t7528>
<t7529>The younger brother, with an arrogant air, said, "There is a medicine box here," and took the box out of a cupboard, placing it on the table, while the elder one looked at him.</t7529>
<t7530>I opened and smelled some of the bottles and brought the stoppers to my lips.</t7530> <t7531>Under different circumstances, I wouldn't have been able to give any of these drug pills that act as poison on their own.</t7531>
<t7532>"Did you not trust the medicines?" asked the little brother.</t7532>
<t7533>"Alright, monsieur, I will give it to you in a moment," I replied, and said nothing more.</t7533>
<t7534>After a considerable struggle, I managed to administer the dose I wanted to the patient.</t7534> <t7535>Since I intended to give the same amount again shortly and observe its effects, I sat right by the bed.</t7535> <t7536>A timid and downcast woman (the wife of the man downstairs) who was taking care of the patient had shrunk into a corner of the room.</t7536> <t7537>The house was damp, falling apart everywhere, and very carelessly furnished – it was clearly being used temporarily and had been recently moved into.</t7537> <t7538>Old thick fabrics had been nailed to the windows to reduce the intensity of the sharp screams.</t7538> <t7539>These screams, cries of "My husband, my father, my brother!", counting up to twelve, and "Shh!" sounds followed each other in a regular pattern.</t7539> <t7540>The fit was so severe that I hadn't untied the restraints preventing him from moving his arms, but I checked to make sure they weren't causing pain.</t7540> <t7541>The only thing that encouraged me in this situation was seeing that my hand placed on the poor man's chest had a calming effect and that this comforted him, even if only for three to five minutes.</t7541> <t7542>On the other hand, it had no effect on the screams; frankly, no pendulum could operate so regularly.</t7542>
<t7543>Since the elimination had such an effect (I think it did), I sat on the edge of the bed for about half an hour with my siblings' eyes on me; then the older one said:</t7543>
<t7544>"There is one more patient.</t7544><t7545>"</t7545>
<t7546>I was taken aback; "Is it an emergency then?" I asked.</t7546>
<t7547>With a nonchalant air, he said, "You'd better see it," and took a lamp in his hand.</t7547>
<t7548>The other patient was lying in one of the back rooms opposite the second staircase, in a place like an attic above a stable.</t7548> <t7549>A part of this area was covered by a low ceiling with plaster; the remaining part opened to the roof covered with tiles, and there were beams across.</t7549> <t7550>In this section, dry grass and straw were piled up for burning, and apples were placed on a pile of sand.</t7550> <t7551>I had to pass through here to get to the other section.</t7551> <t7552>All the details remain vividly in my memory.</t7552> <t7553>As I approach the end of my tenth year of imprisonment in this cell in the Bastille, everything is in my mind with all the details as it was that night.</t7553>
<t7554>On the dry grass on the ground, with a pillow under his head, lay a handsome peasant boy – he couldn't have been older than seventeen.</t7554> <t7555>His teeth were tightly clenched, his right hand claw-like on his chest, and his fiery eyes stared straight at the ceiling as he lay on his back.</t7555> <t7556>When I knelt on one knee and leaned over him, I couldn't see where his wound was; but it was not hard to tell that he had been injured by something sharp and was about to die.</t7556>
<t7557>"I am a doctor, my friend," I said.</t7557> <t7558>"Let me take a look at your wound."</t7558><t7559>"</t7559>
<t7560>"I don't want you to look," said the boy; "never mind.</t7560><t7561>"</t7561>
<t7562>The wound was under my hand, and I eased it a bit to allow me to pull my hand away.</t7562> <t7563>It was a sword wound that had occurred twenty to twenty-four hours ago, but even if it had been immediately attended to by skilled hands, there was no chance of survival.</t7563> <t7564>The boy was dying rapidly.</t7564> <t7565>When I turned my eyes to the older brother, I saw that he was looking at this handsome young man, whose life was fading away, not as if he were a wounded person, but as if he were a wounded bird or rabbit.</t7565>
<t7566>"How did this happen, monsieur?" I asked.</t7566>
<t7567>"This boy is a rabid, common dog!</t7567> <t7568>Villager! He forced my brother to draw his sword and got wounded by his sword –like a gentleman.</t7568><t7569>"</t7569>
<t7570>His response did not contain the slightest bit of pity, sadness, or humanity.</t7570> <t7571>He seemed more disturbed by the fact that this creature from another world was dying there; it would have been better if it died in its own dark corner like a parasitic animal.</t7571> <t7572>There was not an ounce of compassion in his heart for either that young boy or his fate.</t7572>
<t7573>While he was talking, the boy's eyes slowly turned towards him, and then slowly turned towards me.</t7573>
<t7574>"Doctor, these nobles are very proud; but we, the common dogs, can also be proud, sometimes.</t7574> <t7575>They rob us, crush us, beat us, kill us, but we still have a bit of pride left, sometimes.</t7575> <t7576>Have you seen her... the girl, Doctor?</t7576><t7577>"</t7577>
<t7578>"Even though there was a distance, the screams and wails could be heard from there.</t7578> <t7579>The boy had talked about the girl as if she were lying next to us.</t7579>
<t7580>"I saw," I said.</t7580>
<t7581>"She is my sister, Doctor.</t7581> <t7582>These nobles have every kind of disgraceful right, for years they used our sisters' chastity and virtue as they wished.</t7582> <t7583>But there were good girls among them too.</t7583> <t7584>I know, I had heard this from my father too.</t7584> <t7585>My sister was a good girl.</t7585> <t7586>She was engaged to a good young man, one of this man's tenants.</t7586> <t7587>We were all tenants of his – the man standing over there.</t7587> <t7588>The other one is his brother, the worst of a bad lineage."</t7588> <t7589>The boy's body could barely find the strength to speak; but his soul was screaming as if it were shouting.</t7589>
<t7590>"Here, the man standing over there robbed us; after all, they are superior beings, and we are the dogs beside them – they collect merciless taxes from us, make us work for them without any payment, force us to grind our wheat in their mill, compel us to feed their pet birds with the handful of wheat we have, and do not allow us to keep even a single bird of our own. Robbery and plundering had become so rampant that if we found a small piece of meat, we would eat it behind closed doors in fear that their men might see it and take it from us – in other words, we were so robbed, so captured, and so impoverished that my father would tell us how terrifying it was to bring a child into this world and would say that we should pray for our women to be barren so that our wretched lineage would come to an end."</t7590><t7591>"</t7591>
<t7592>I had never seen the feeling of oppression erupt in such a way and turn into a fire before.</t7592> <t7593>I had guessed that this feeling was hidden somewhere inside people, but I had never seen it manifest in this way before this struggling child.</t7593>
<t7594>"Still, my sister got married, Doctor.</t7594> <t7595>The poor man had an ailment at the time, my sister married this man she loved, so she could take care of him in our cabin –that man would probably call it a doghouse.</t7595> <t7596>It had only been a few weeks since they got married when that man's brother saw her, liked her, and asked her husband to lend her to him –the authority of husbands like ours means nothing!</t7596> <t7597>The man was quite willing, but my sister was a good and honorable woman and hated that man's brother at least as much as I did.</t7597> <t7598>So what did these two do to persuade her husband to convince my sister, to influence her in this matter?</t7598><t7599>"</t7599>
<t7600>The child's eyes, fixed on me, slowly turned to the men watching him, and when I looked at these two faces, I saw that everything the boy had said was true.</t7600> <t7601>Even here, in the Bastille, I can see the clash of two opposing kinds of pride; the utter indifference of the noble gentleman and the intense emotions and passionate revenge of the peasant.</t7601>
<t7602>"You know, Doctor, it is among the rights of these nobles to harness and drive dogs like us in front of their carriages.</t7602> <t7603>They harnessed and drove my sister's husband to the carriage: You know, it is also among their rights to keep us on their lands all night to chase away the frogs and ensure they sleep well: they made the poor man wait in that terrible fog all night and harnessed him to the carriage the next day. But he still wasn't convinced.</t7603> <t7604>No! Then one noon, while he was unhitched from the harness to eat –if he could find any– he cried, sobbing exactly twelve times, breaking into sobs every time the bell struck the hour, and died in his wife's arms.</t7604><t7605>"</t7605>
<t7606>The boy was clearly determined to stay alive until he finished recounting all this cruelty.</t7606> <t7607>Just as he exerted strength to tightly clasp his hand to his chest like a claw to close his wound, he was also pushing back the shadows of death attacking him with the same force.</t7607>
<t7608>"Then, with the permission and even the help of this man, his brother took my sister away: despite all the things my sister told him –and you will soon learn what she said, Doctor, perhaps you already understand– he took my sister away for a moment of pleasure and amusement.</t7608> <t7609>I saw them as they passed by me on the road.</t7609> <t7610>When I told what happened to the people at home, my father had a heart attack; but not a single word came out of his mouth that could express his pain.</t7610> <t7611>I took my little sister (I have another sister) to a place where this man couldn't reach her, at least where she couldn't be his slave.</t7611> <t7612>Then I followed his brother here and last night I climbed in like a dog but with a sword in my hand... I entered.</t7612> <t7613>–Where is the attic window?</t7613> <t7614>Wasn't it somewhere around here?</t7614><t7615>'</t7615>
<t7616>His vision began to darken; the world around him was gradually closing in.</t7616> <t7617>When I looked around, I saw that the grass and hay were crushed, as if a struggle had taken place.</t7617>
<t7618>"When my brother heard me, he immediately ran.</t7618> <t7619>I told him not to come inside until the man was dead.</t7619> <t7620>This man came inside and first threw some money at me; then he hit me with a whip.</t7620> <t7621>But I, as a lowly dog, hit him so hard that he drew his sword.</t7621> <t7622>With the sword stained by my lowly blood, he could cut me into a thousand pieces if he wanted; after all, he had drawn it to defend himself – and with all the skill he had acquired throughout his life, he stabbed me with it.</t7622><t7623>"</t7623>
<t7624>My eyes had caught the pieces of a broken sword lying among the straw on the ground a few minutes ago.</t7624> <t7625>This belonged to a noble.</t7625> <t7626>The old sword lying a little further away seemed to belong to a soldier.</t7626>
<t7627>"Lift me up, Doctor; lift me up, come on.</t7627> <t7628>Where is it?</t7628><t7629>"</t7629>
<t7630>Thinking that he meant his brother, I said, "He is not here," while supporting the boy to sit up.</t7630>
<t7631>"Oh man! Like all nobles, he is so proud that he is afraid to look at me.</t7631> <t7632>Where is the man standing over there?</t7632> <t7633>Turn my face to him.</t7633><t7634>"</t7634>
<t7635>I rested my head on my knee and lifted it as the boy had instructed.</t7635> <t7636>But suddenly, an extraordinary strength came over the boy, and he stood up completely.</t7636> <t7637>He had forced me to straighten up with him, otherwise, I wouldn't have been able to support him.</t7637>
<t7638>Turning to the man with eyes wide open and raising his right hand in the air, the boy said, "Marquis, when the day comes that you are held accountable for your actions, you and the worst of your lineage will answer for each and every one of them."</t7638> <t7639>"So that it is clear what I have done, I now draw a cross on you with my blood."</t7639> <t7640>"When the day comes that you are held accountable for your actions, the worst person of this evil lineage will also answer for each and every one of them."</t7640> <t7641>"So that it is clear what I have done, I now draw a cross on him with my blood."</t7641><t7642>"</t7642>
<t7643>Then he placed his hand on the wound on his chest and drew two crosses in the air with his index finger.</t7643> <t7644>After his finger remained in the air for a short while, it fell to the ground; then he fell himself, and I straightened his dead body.</t7644>
<t7645>When I returned to the young woman, I saw that her madness continued with the same order and continuity.</t7645> <t7646>I knew that this could last for hours and perhaps end in the silence of the grave.</t7646>
<t7647>I gave her another dose of the medicine I had given her before and sat by her bedside until late at night.</t7647> <t7648>There was no decrease in her sharp screams, nor any change in the sequence of the words she was saying.</t7648> <t7649>She kept saying the same thing: "My husband, my father, my brother!</t7649> <t7650>One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve.</t7650> <t7651>Shh!"</t7651>
<t7652>All of this lasted twenty-six hours from the moment I first saw him.</t7652> <t7653>I had gone back and forth twice and sat next to him again when he started to hesitate.</t7653> <t7654>In that short time, I did everything I could to take advantage of the opportunity, and he gradually became numb and lay there like a dead man.</t7654>
<t7655>After a long and terrifying storm, the rain and wind had finally subsided, it seemed..</t7655> <t7656>I uncrossed my arms and called the woman to help better position her on the bed and to fix her torn dress.</t7656> <t7657>That's when I realized she was a woman carrying a baby in her womb, and thus, I lost the little hope I had for her recovery.</t7657>
<t7658>The Marquis, whom I will still refer to as the elder brother, dismounted from his horse and came into the room in his boots, asking, "Is he dead?"</t7658>
<t7659>"No," I said; "but death is very near.</t7659><t7660>"</t7660>
<t7661>"How strong the bodies of these miserable creatures are!" he said, looking at the woman with curious eyes.</t7661>
<t7662>"Pain and despair," I said, "harbor a tremendous power within."</t7662><t7663>"</t7663>
<t7664>First, he laughed at my words, then he frowned.</t7664> <t7665>He pulled a chair next to mine with his feet; he ordered the woman to leave, then lowered his voice and said the following.</t7665>
<t7666>"Doctor, when my brother got into trouble with these villagers, the first thing that came to my mind was to call you.</t7666> <t7667>You are a person of high repute and, as a young man with a bright future, you must be smart enough to look out for your own interests.</t7667> <t7668>Let what you have seen here stay here, do not let it go outside.</t7668><t7669>"</t7669>
<t7670>I listened to the patient's breathing and avoided responding.</t7670>
<t7671>"Will you grant me the honor of listening to me, Doctor?</t7671><t7672>"</t7672>
<t7673>"Monsieur," I said, "in my profession, the secrets of patients always remain secret." I was being cautious while answering, as what I had seen and heard had greatly disturbed me.</t7673>
<t7674>It was so difficult to hear the patient's breath that I tried to carefully check his pulse and heartbeats.</t7674> <t7675>He was alive, but just barely.</t7675> <t7676>As I sat back down and looked around, I saw the siblings scrutinizing me with attentive eyes.</t7676>
<t7677>I am writing these lines with great difficulty; the weather is very cold, and I am so afraid of being caught and sent to an underground cell and being left in complete darkness that I will keep this writing short.</t7677> <t7678>There is no impairment or trouble in my memory; I remember everything I talked about with the brothers very clearly, word for word.</t7678>
<t7679>The young woman agonized for a week.</t7679> <t7680>As she was about to take her last breath, I could understand very little of what she said when I brought my ear close to her lips.</t7680> <t7681>She asked me where she was, I told her; she asked who I was, I told her.</t7681> <t7682>I also asked her surname, but it was in vain.</t7682> <t7683>She gently shook her head on the pillow and, just like her sister, she kept her secret.</t7683>
<t7684>I didn't have the opportunity to ask her another question until I told the siblings that she was rapidly deteriorating and didn't have much time left.</t7684> <t7685>Until then, even though there was no one else with the young woman besides me and the peasant woman, one of the siblings was always sitting enviously just behind the curtain at the head of the bed where I was.</t7685> <t7686>But after the woman worsened, they didn't pay much attention to what we were talking about, so much so that I couldn't help but wonder if I was dying too.</t7686>
<t7687>Every time I looked at them, I saw that both of them could not stomach the fact that the younger brother (that's what I call him) had fought a duel with a peasant boy.</t7687> <t7688>It seemed that the only thing that bothered them and stuck in their minds was the thought that this matter had dishonored the family and made them look ridiculous.</t7688> <t7689>Whenever I made eye contact with the younger brother, I understood from his gaze how much he hated me, after all, he knew what I had learned from the boy.</t7689> <t7690>He might have treated me more properly and politely than the older brother, but I could see it.</t7690> <t7691>Moreover, it was not hard to see that I was a burden on the older brother's mind as well.</t7691>
<t7692>Two hours before midnight, my patient died – according to my watch, it coincided with the time I first saw him.</t7692> <t7693>When his young, distraught head gently fell to the side and all the worldly injustices and pains he had endured came to an end, I was the only one by his side.</t7693>
<t7694>The brothers were impatient to set off and were waiting in a room downstairs.</t7694> <t7695>While I was by the bed, I heard them hitting their boots with their whips and pacing up and down the room.</t7695>
<t7696>When I went down to them, the older one asked, "Did he finally die?"</t7696>
<t7697>"He died," I said.</t7697>
<t7698>"Congratulations, brother," said the older brother who was turning around.</t7698>
<t7699>He had previously offered money, but I had postponed it.</t7699> <t7700>This time, he handed me a pouch of gold.</t7700> <t7701>I took it from his hand, but I placed it on the table.</t7701> <t7702>I had thought about this matter and decided not to take anything.</t7702>
<t7703>"Please forgive me," I said.</t7703> <t7704>"But under these conditions, I cannot accept.</t7704><t7705>"</t7705>
<t7706>First, they looked at each other, then when I nodded in greeting, they responded in kind, and we parted without saying anything else to each other.</t7706>
<t7707>I am tired, tired, very tired –these pains have finished me.</t7707> <t7708>I cannot read what I have written with these skinny fingers.</t7708>
<t7709>Early in the morning, a small box with my name on it and a pouch of gold inside was left in front of my door.</t7709> <t7710>From the very first moment, I felt uneasy and was thinking about what I should do.</t7710> <t7711>That day, I decided to write a special letter to the Minister about what had happened to these two patients I encountered and the place I visited; I was going to tell him everything.</t7711> <t7712>I knew the power of the Palace and how privileged the nobles were, and I didn't expect them to take this matter seriously, but at least I would have eased my own mind.</t7712> <t7713>I had kept the incident a secret even from my own wife, and I found it appropriate to mention this in my letter.</t7713> <t7714>I wasn't aware of the danger I would be in if others learned about it, but I was conscious that it could be dangerous for others.</t7714>
<t7715>I was so busy that day that I couldn't finish the letter that night.</t7715> <t7716>The next morning, I got up much earlier than usual to be able to finish it.</t7716> <t7717>It was the last day of the year.</t7717> <t7718>Just as my letter was newly finished and was in front of me, they told me that a lady who wanted to see me had arrived:</t7718>
<t7719>Every day, I am drifting further away from the task I have committed myself to.</t7719> <t7720>This place is so cold, dark, and my feelings are so numb, with such a great gloom weighing down on me.</t7720>
<t7721>The young person who came to see me was an attractive and very charming woman, but she seemed to have little time left to live.</t7721> <t7722>She was in great distress.</t7722> <t7723>She introduced herself as the wife of Marquis Evremonde.</t7723> <t7724>At that moment, I connected the name the boy used when talking about the elder brother with the letter embroidered on the scarf in my mind, and it was not difficult to conclude that I had seen that nobleman very recently.</t7724>
<t7725>My memory is still intact, but I can't write down our conversation exactly.</t7725> <t7726>I suspect that I am being watched much more than before, but I can't be sure exactly when I am being watched.</t7726> <t7727>She had suspected some of the truths in the story of brutality, her husband's involvement in the incident, and my being taken there, and had discovered some on her own.</t7727> <t7728>But she didn't know that the young woman had died.</t7728> <t7729>According to what she said in great pain, she hoped to secretly meet with the young woman and show her mercy.</t7729> <t7730>Moreover, she hoped to keep God's wrath away from the house of those who had long suffered.</t7730>
<t7731>He thought he had a sister and his greatest desire was to help her.</t7731> <t7732>I told him that I was aware of the existence of such a sister; but I didn't know anything more.</t7732> <t7733>The reason he trusted me and came was the hope that I could tell him the name of that girl and where she lived.</t7733> <t7734>However, I was unaware of both.</t7734>
<t7735>These pieces of paper got me into trouble.</t7735> <t7736>Yesterday, a guard took one and gave me a warning.</t7736> <t7737>That's all for today.</t7737>
<t7738>She was a kind-hearted, compassionate woman and was unhappy in her marriage.</t7738> <t7739>How could it be!</t7739> <t7740>Her husband's brother didn't trust her at all and didn't love her, and he influenced everyone by saying bad things about her; the woman had come to fear both him and her husband.</t7740> <t7741>When I escorted her to the door, I saw that there was a sweet little boy, about two or three years old, in her car.</t7741>
<t7742>"For his sake, Doctor," she said, pointing to the child with tears in her eyes, "I will do whatever I can.</t7742> <t7743>Otherwise, with this name he has inherited, he will never see the light of day.</t7743> <t7744>It seems to me that if the price of these sins is not paid, one day he will suffer for it.</t7744> <t7745>Whatever I have left – which is only slightly more than the worth of a few jewels – I will leave to my son so that his first task, if his sister can be found, will be to bestow this burden of mercy and sorrow from his late mother upon this wounded family.</t7745><t7746>"</t7746>
<t7747>Then the woman kissed and caressed her son, saying, "All of this is for you, my dear son."</t7747> <t7748>"You will do as I say, won't you little Charles?" she said.</t7748> <t7749>The child bravely replied, "Yes!"</t7749> <t7750>I kissed the woman's hand, and she took her son in her arms, kissed and caressed him, and left.</t7750> <t7751>I never saw that woman again.</t7751>
<t7752>Thinking that the woman pronounced her husband's name knowing that I knew it, I did not mention his name in my letter.</t7752> <t7753>I sealed the letter and, since I could not trust anyone, I personally delivered it that day.</t7753>
<t7754>That night, the last night of the year, around nine o'clock, a man in black clothes rang my doorbell, wanted to see me, and quietly followed my young servant Ernest Defarge upstairs.</t7754> <t7755>When my servant entered the room where I was sitting with my wife –oh my wife, my dear wife!</t7755> <t7756>My beautiful young English wife!– we saw that the man who should have been waiting at the door was silently standing behind my servant.</t7756>
<t7757>"There is an urgent case on Rue St Honore," said the man.</t7757> <t7758>He said it wouldn't take much of my time and that a car was waiting downstairs.</t7758>
<t7759>The car brought me here, to my grave.</t7759> <t7760>As soon as the house disappeared from view, someone from behind reached out and tightly wrapped my mouth with a black cloth and tied my arms.</t7760> <t7761>From a dark corner, those two brothers emerged and approached us, indicating with a single gesture that they recognized me.</t7761> <t7762>The marquis took out the letter I had written from his pocket and showed it to me, then burned it with the flame of a lantern he was holding and scattered the ashes with his foot.</t7762> <t7763>No one said a single word.</t7763> <t7764>I was brought here, to the grave where I was buried alive.</t7764>
<t7765>If during these terrible years God had touched the hard heart of either of these two brothers and brought me news of my dear wife –at least to tell me whether she was dead or alive– then I might have thought that God had not entirely abandoned these brothers.</t7765> <t7766>But now I know that the red cross is a deadly sign for them and that they will never partake in God's mercy.</t7766> <t7767>I, Alexandre Manette, sorrowful prisoner, on this last night of the year 1767, in unbearable agony, consign them and all their lineage to the day they will account for all their deeds, down to the last member.</t7767> <t7768>Surely, they will be held accountable both in this world and in the presence of God.</t7768>
<t7769>When the document was finished being read, a terrible noise erupted in the hall.</t7769> <t7770>It was the sound of an immense bloodthirstiness and agitation.</t7770> <t7771>The Doctor's writings had fanned the flames of the most vengeful passions of the time, and in this atmosphere, the people would not calm down until a head rolled before them.</t7771>
<t7772>There was no need to ask the Defarges in front of the court and the spectators why they did not show this document along with the other Bastille documents that came into their hands during the ceremonial procession and why they kept these in their possession.</t7772> <t7773>There was also no need to show that this vile family had long been cursed by St. Antoine and recorded in the deadly register.</t7773> <t7774>No matter how virtuous a man was, no matter how important services he had rendered, it was unlikely that he would escape such an accusation on that day.</t7774>
<t7775>The worst part for this man condemned to death was that the person accusing him was a citizen known to the public, a friend to whom he was deeply devoted, and at the same time, his father-in-law.</t7775> <t7776>One of the most outrageous demands of the people was to hold sacrificial ceremonies on the altar, taking national virtues from ancient times as an example.</t7776> <t7777>Therefore, when the President said that this good doctor of the Republic had done a great favor to the Republic by eradicating the roots of the disgusting aristocratic family and that he should undoubtedly feel a noble excitement and pleasure from this event, which left his daughter a widow and her child an orphan (if he hadn't said it, it would have been his own head on the line), there was an outburst of excitement and patriotic fervor in the hall; no one felt the slightest bit of pity.</t7777>
<t7778>Madam Defarge, smiling at Revenge, murmured, "The Doctor is quite influential, isn't he?"</t7778> <t7779>"Now let's see you save him, Doctor dear, go on, save him!</t7779><t7780>"</t7780>
<t7781>A murmur rose with each jury member's vote.</t7781> <t7782>Again, and again.</t7782> <t7783>The murmurs followed one another.</t7783>
<t7784>The decision was unanimously approved.</t7784> <t7785>He was both a heartfelt and a born aristocrat and an enemy of the Republic; he was a tyrant who had become the talk of everyone.</t7785> <t7786>He would return to the Conciergerie and be executed within twenty-four hours!</t7786>
<t7787>XI</t7787>
<t7788>Twilight</t7788>
<t7789>The poor wife of the innocent man condemned to death was struck as if hit in the head when she heard the verdict.</t7789> <t7790>But she did not utter a word, and the voice inside her that said she was the only person in this world who could support her husband through this agony without exacerbating it was so strong that she quickly regained her composure, even shaking off the shock she had experienced.</t7790>
<t7791>The court had adjourned because the judges needed to attend the demonstration outside.</t7791> <t7792>As the crowd noisily made their way through the rows and emptied the hall, Lucie stood with a loving and comforting expression on her face, arms open to her husband.</t7792>
<t7793>"If only I could touch her!</t7793> <t7794>If only I could hug her just once!</t7794> <t7795>Oh kind-hearted citizens, please have mercy on us!</t7795><t7796>"</t7796>
<t7797>Only two of the four men who came to get him last night, Barsad and a guard, remained beside Charles.</t7797> <t7798>Everyone had poured into the street to watch the show.</t7798> <t7799>Turning to those beside him, Barsad said, "Let her embrace him; but only for a minute."</t7799> <t7800>Barsad's suggestion was silently accepted, and they led Lucie through the chairs in the hall to a high place where, when her husband leaned from the dock, he could take her into his arms.</t7800>
<t7801>"Goodbye, my one and only love.</t7801> <t7802>Our child is entrusted to you.</t7802> <t7803>One day, we will meet again in the place where weary bodies rest!</t7803><t7804>"</t7804>
<t7805>These were the words that fell from Charles's mouth as he pressed his wife to his chest.</t7805>
<t7806>"I can endure this, dear Charles.</t7806> <t7807>God gave me strength.</t7807> <t7808>Pray for our child.</t7808><t7809>"</t7809>
<t7810>"I send my prayers with you.</t7810> <t7811>I send my kisses with you.</t7811> <t7812>Say goodbye to him for me.</t7812><t7813>"</t7813>
<t7814>"My dear husband.</t7814> <t7815>No! Wait a minute!" Charles was trying to pull himself away from her.</t7815> <t7816>"Our separation won't last long.</t7816> <t7817>This separation will break my heart more with each passing day; but I will fulfill my duty until the last moment, and when I leave our child one day, God will grant him good friends, just as He granted me.</t7817><t7818>"</t7818>
<t7819>Her father had followed Lucie and was just about to kneel before both of them when Darnay extended his hand to stop him and called out:</t7819>
<t7820>"No, no!</t7820> <t7821>What have you done, what have you done to make us kneel before you!</t7821> <t7822>We now know the great struggle you put up in the old days.</t7822> <t7823>We now know what you went through when you doubted my lineage and then became certain of it.</t7823> <t7824>We also know that for the sake of your dear daughter, you suppressed and overcame the justified hatred within you.</t7824> <t7825>We thank you with all our hearts, with our love and respect.</t7825> <t7826>May God protect you!</t7826><t7827>"</t7827>
<t7828>The only response Lucie's father could give was to run his hands through his white hair and tug at it with a scream of pain.</t7828>
<t7829>"It couldn't have been any other way," said the prisoner.</t7829> <t7830>"Everything has come to pass as it was meant to.</t7830> <t7831>The first thing that brought my mortal existence to you was my poor mother's futile desire to fulfill what she asked of me.</t7831> <t7832>No good would come from so much evil, and such a painful beginning would naturally not end with a happy conclusion.</t7832> <t7833>Rest assured and forgive me.</t7833> <t7834>May God protect you all!</t7834><t7835>"</t7835>
<t7836>As Darnay was taken away, his wife had to let him go and looked after him with her hands clasped as if in prayer, a radiant expression on her face, and a comforting smile.</t7836> <t7837>When her husband reached the prison door, Lucie turned and rested her head lovingly on her father's chest, tried to say something to him, and then collapsed to the ground.</t7837>
<t7838>Sydney Carton, who had been standing motionless in a remote corner until then, sprang up and lifted the young woman.</t7838> <t7839>Only her father and Mr. Lorry were beside Lucie.</t7839> <t7840>As he lifted her from the ground and supported her head, Carton's arms were trembling.</t7840> <t7841>However, he had an air that contained not just mercy, but also a hint of pride.</t7841>
<t7842>"Shall I carry it to the car?</t7842> <t7843>It's very light anyway.</t7843><t7844>"</t7844>
<t7845>He carried Lucie to the car without difficulty and gently laid her on the seat.</t7845> <t7846>Following them, Lucie's father and her old friend Mr. Lorry also got into the car, and Carton took his place next to the driver.</t7846>
<t7847>Just a few hours earlier, when they arrived at the entrance where Lucie imagined stepping on uneven stones in the dark, Sydney Carton lifted Lucie into his arms again and carried her up the stairs to her room.</t7847> <t7848>When he laid her down on a couch there, her daughter and Miss Pross knelt beside her and cried.</t7848>
<t7849>Carton said to Miss Pross in a low voice, "Don't try to bring him around, it's better this way.</t7849> <t7850>Don't wake him up, he just fainted.</t7850><t7851>"</t7851>
<t7852>Little Lucie jumped up and threw herself around Carton's neck with great distress, crying out, "Oh Carton, Carton, dear Carton!"</t7852> <t7853>"I'm so glad you came, I think you'll do something to save my mother, and my father too!</t7853> <t7854>Oh, look at my mother, Carton! Can those who love her bear to see her like this?</t7854><t7855>"</t7855>
<t7856>Carton leaned down to the child and pressed his own face against the child's glowing cheeks.</t7856> <t7857>Then he gently moved the child away and looked at the mother lying unconscious.</t7857>
<t7858>"Before leaving," he said and paused –"can I kiss her?</t7858><t7859>"</t7859>
<t7860>Later, it would be remembered that at the moment when Carton leaned down and touched the woman's face with his lips, he murmured something.</t7860> <t7861>At that moment, little Lucie, who was closest to him, would later tell them and, when she became a sweet old woman, her grandchildren, that she heard Carton say to his mother, "A life you love."</t7861>
<t7862>When Carton moved to the other room, he turned to Lucie's father, who followed him along with Mr. Lorry, and said;</t7862>
<t7863>"You were very effective yesterday, but Doctor Manette; try once more.</t7863> <t7864>All those judges and influential people are very kind to you and are aware of your services, aren't they?</t7864><t7865>"</t7865>
<t7866>"Nothing about Charles was hidden from me.</t7866> <t7867>My belief in saving him was very strong; and I did save him.</t7867><t7868>"</t7868> <t7869>He had spoken this answer with great difficulty and very slowly.</t7869>
<t7870>"Try again.</t7870> <t7871>We don't have much time until noon tomorrow, but try.</t7871><t7872>"</t7872>
<t7873>"I intend to try.</t7873> <t7874>There is no time to lose.</t7874><t7875>"</t7875>
<t7876>"Beautiful.</t7876> <t7877>I know that you can do amazing things with the energy you have, just like you did before – but of course," he said, smiling and sighing, "this is truly a challenging situation.</t7877> <t7878>Still, try!</t7878> <t7879>When we waste our lives, it has no value, whereas life is worth this effort.</t7879> <t7880>If it weren't, it wouldn't be so hard to set it aside.</t7880><t7881>"</t7881>
<t7882>"Now directly," said Doctor Manette, "I will go to the Prosecutor and the President and to other people whose names I do not wish to mention.</t7882> <t7883>I will write where I need to write and – But wait a minute! There is a celebration in the street and I won't be able to reach anyone until it gets dark.</t7883><t7884>"</t7884>
<t7885>"Correct.</t7885> <t7886>Well! This is already a weak hope at best, and the situation won't be more hopeless just because it remains in the dark.</t7886> <t7887>But I would like to know what course of action you will take!</t7887> <t7888>Even if I have no expectations.</t7888> <t7889>When will you probably meet with those terrible powers, Doctor Manette?</t7889><t7890>"</t7890>
<t7891>"I hope, as soon as darkness falls.</t7891> <t7892>That is, in a few hours.</t7892><t7893>"</t7893>
<t7894>"The weather gets dark around four.</t7894> <t7895>Let's extend the time by a few more hours.</t7895> <t7896>If I go to Mr. Lorry at nine o'clock, can I learn what you are doing from our friend or directly from you?</t7896><t7897>"</t7897>
<t7898>"Yes.</t7898><t7899>"</t7899>
<t7900>"Good luck with your work!"</t7900>
<t7901>Mr. Lorry accompanied Sydney to the outer door and, as he was leaving, touched his shoulder and turned him back.</t7901>
<t7902>"I have no hope," said Mr. Lorry, in a low and sorrowful whisper.</t7902>
<t7903>"I don't have one either."</t7903><t7904>"</t7904>
<t7905>"Even if any or all of those men had the intention to spare his life – which is a very big expectation; after all, what meaning does his or any human's life have for them! – I don't know if they could dare to do it after all the commotion in the courtroom.</t7905><t7906>"</t7906>
<t7907>"I think so too.</t7907> <t7908>In that noise, I felt like I heard the guillotine drop.</t7908><t7909>"</t7909>
<t7910>Mr. Lorry leaned his arm against the edge of the door and buried his head in his arm.</t7910>
<t7911>"Don't lose hope," said Carton softly, "don't be upset.</t7911> <t7912>I encouraged Doctor Manette to this idea, thinking it might be a consolation for Lucie in the future.</t7912> <t7913>Otherwise, Lucie might think, 'My husband's life was wasted for nothing, it ended,' and put herself in distress.</t7913><t7914>"</t7914>
<t7915>"Yes, yes, correct," replied Mr. Lorry, wiping his eyes, "you are right.</t7915> <t7916>But the end is very near; there is really no hope.</t7916><t7917>"</t7917>
<t7918>"True."</t7918> <t7919>"The end is very near, there is really no hope," repeated Carton.</t7919> <t7920>Then he walked down the road with determined steps.</t7920>
<t7921>XII</t7921>
<t7922>Darkness</t7922>
<t7923>Sydney Carton stood in the middle of the street, unable to decide where to go.</t7923> <t7924>He said to himself, "At nine, at Tellson's," with a distracted expression.</t7924> <t7925>"Should I do something to make myself seen in the meantime?</t7925> <t7926>It would be good.</t7926> <t7927>It would be good for these people here to know that a man like me exists; it is both a prudent measure and a necessary preparation.</t7927> <t7928>But one must be careful, very careful!</t7928> <t7929>I must think it over thoroughly!</t7929><t7930>"</t7930>
<t7931>Weighing his steps directed towards a certain object, he turned into a few streets on the road that was beginning to darken and tried to see the possible outcomes of the thought in his mind.</t7931> <t7932>His initial impression was confirmed.</t7932> <t7933>Finally, with a determined attitude, he said, "Absolutely, these people need to know that there is a man like me here."</t7933> <t7934>Then he turned his face towards St Antoine.</t7934>
<t7935>That day, Defarge introduced himself as the owner of a wine shop in the outskirts of St. Antoine.</t7935> <t7936>For someone who knew the city well, finding his house without asking anyone was not a difficult thing.</t7936> <t7937>Carton learned the location of the shop well and, after leaving the nearby streets again, he had a meal at a restaurant and then fell into a deep sleep.</t7937> <t7938>For the first time in many years, he had not consumed much alcohol that night.</t7938> <t7939>Since last night, he had only drunk slightly diluted wine, and last night he had slowly poured the cognac onto Mr. Lorry's hearthstone like a man who no longer had any use for it.</t7939>
<t7940>When he hit the streets again after waking up refreshed, it was already seven o'clock.</t7940> <t7941>As he was heading towards St Antoine, he stopped in front of a shop window with a mirror and roughly adjusted his loosened tie, the collar of his coat, and his disheveled hair.</t7941> <t7942>Once this task was done, he headed straight to Defarge's shop and went inside.</t7942>
<t7943>In the shop, there was no one but Jacques Three with his crow-like voice, constantly moving his fingers.</t7943> <t7944>This man, whom he saw among the jury members, was leaning on the small counter, drinking his liquor, and chatting with the Defarge couple.</t7944> <t7945>Revenge, as if it were an ordinary member of this group, was mingling into the conversation.</t7945>
<t7946>When Carton entered the shop and sat down, asking for a small wine (in poor French), Madam Defarge first gave him an indifferent look; then she examined him with a bit more curiosity, and soon after with even more curious eyes, and approached him to ask what he had ordered.</t7946>
<t7947>He repeated what he had just said.</t7947>
<t7948>Madam Defarge raised her black eyebrows curiously and asked, "Are you English?"</t7948>
<t7949>Carton looked at the woman as if he had difficulty understanding even the smallest French word, and then, with the same foreign accent as before, said, "Yes madam, yes! I am English!"</t7949>
<t7950>Madam Defarge returned to her counter to fetch the wine, and while Carton had taken a Jacobin newspaper in his hand, bending over the words as if trying to decipher what they said, he heard the woman exclaim, "I swear, just like Evremonde!"</t7950>
<t7951>Defarge brought the wine and wished him a good evening.</t7951>
<t7952>"Sir?"</t7952><t7953>"</t7953>
<t7954>"Good evening.</t7954><t7955>"</t7955>
<t7956>"Ha, good evening citizen," said Carton, while filling his glass.</t7956> <t7957>"Ahh! The wine is also very good.</t7957> <t7958>I drink to the Republic.</t7958><t7959>"</t7959>
<t7960>When Defarge returned to the counter, he said, "Yes, it does resemble a bit indeed."</t7960> <t7961>Upon this, Madam replied sharply, "I tell you, it looks exactly like him."</t7961> <t7962>As if trying to ease the atmosphere, Jacques Three said, "Look madam, your mind is always on him." Warm-hearted Revenge laughed, "Indeed! You are eager to see him once more tomorrow!"</t7962>
<t7963>Carton followed the lines and words in the newspaper with a diligent and pensive expression on his face, slowly tracing them with his index finger.</t7963> <t7964>The others, with their arms resting side by side on the counter, were speaking in low voices.</t7964> <t7965>After a few minutes of silence, during which they watched Carton focused on his newspaper without disturbing him, they resumed their conversation.</t7965>
<t7966>"Madam is right," said Jacques Three.</t7966> <t7967>"Why should we stop?</t7967> <t7968>This is an incredible power.</t7968> <t7969>Why should we stop?</t7969><t7970>"</t7970>
<t7971>"It's all well and good," said Defarge, "but we need to stop somewhere.</t7971> <t7972>The whole issue is, where will we stop?</t7972><t7973>"</t7973>
<t7974>"When they are all destroyed," said the madam.</t7974>
<t7975>Jacques Three shouted, "Wonderful!" in a hoarse voice.</t7975> <t7976>Revenge also loved this idea.</t7976>
<t7977>"Destroying them all is a nice idea, my dear," said Defarge, a bit troubled; "I am not generally against it.</t7977> <t7978>But that Doctor has suffered a lot; you saw the man today; his face when the paper was read.</t7978><t7979>"</t7979>
<t7980>"Of course, I noticed what happened to your face!" the madam repeated, in a contemptuous and angry manner.</t7980> <t7981>"Yes.</t7981> <t7982>I saw your face.</t7982> <t7983>This face was definitely not the face of a loyal citizen to the Republic.</t7983> <t7984>Let them deal with it however they want!</t7984><t7985>"</t7985>
<t7986>Defarge, as if objecting, continued his speech, "Well, my wife," he said, "did you see the pain your daughter went through?</t7986> <t7987>Who knows how great a pain this is for her father!</t7987><t7988>"</t7988>
<t7989>"I saw your daughter too," replied the madam; "yes, I looked at her from time to time.</t7989> <t7990>Today I examined her closely, and I had examined her on previous days as well.</t7990> <t7991>I examined her both in court and on the street next to the prison.</t7991> <t7992>But now, it's necessary to raise this finger!" She raised her finger (the person listening to them never took his eyes off the newspaper) and brought it down on the edge of the counter with a loud thud, as if she were lowering the blade of a guillotine.</t7992>
<t7993>"This is an amazing citizen!" shouted the jury member in a hoarse voice.</t7993>
<t7994>"She is an angel!" said Revenge and hugged the madam.</t7994>
<t7995>Turning to her husband, "As for you," the lady continued mercilessly, "if it were up to you –thankfully it's not– you would still save this man even now.</t7995><t7996>"</t7996>
<t7997>"Hey!" objected Defarge.</t7997> <t7998>"Even if it were an easy thing, I wouldn't bother.</t7998> <t7999>But I would leave this job here.</t7999> <t8000>I'm saying, let's stop now.</t8000><t8001>"</t8001>
<t8002>"Look at me, Jacques," said Madame Defarge angrily; "you too, little Vengeance; both of you look at me!</t8002> <t8003>Listen now!</t8003> <t8004>I had already recorded this cruel and oppressive family to be destroyed for all the crimes they committed.</t8004> <t8005>If you want, ask my husband.</t8005><t8006>"</t8006>
<t8007>Without being asked anything further, Defarge confirmed, "Yes, that's correct."</t8007>
<t8008>"At the beginning of these tremendous days, when the Bastille fell, he found that letter which is read today and brought it home, then at midnight, when no one was left in the shop, he closed the door and we read it right here, under the light of this lamp.</t8008> <t8009>If you want, ask him.</t8009><t8010>"</t8010>
<t8011>"Yes, that's right," confirmed Defarge.</t8011>
<t8012>"That night, after we finished reading the letter and the lamp went out, and when the first light of day filtered through the shutters and those iron bars, I told her that I would reveal a secret to her."</t8012> <t8013>"If you want, ask her."</t8013><t8014>"</t8014>
<t8015>"Yes, that's right," Defarge confirmed again.</t8015>
<t8016>"I revealed my secret to her.</t8016> <t8017>Striking my chest with both hands as I am doing now, I said to her, 'Defarge, I grew up among the fishermen by the sea, and as it is written in that paper found in the Bastille, that peasant family abused by the two Evremonde brothers was my family.</t8017> <t8018>Defarge, the sister of the boy lying on the ground, wounded and at death's door, was my sister, that husband was my sister's husband, that unborn child was their child, that boy was my brother, that father was my father, those who died were my dead, and it falls upon me to seek justice for all of them!' If you want, ask her.</t8018><t8019>"</t8019>
<t8020>Defarge was now tired of confirming, simply listening to the woman, and when she wanted him to confirm, he reluctantly agreed.</t8020> <t8021>It was time to confirm once again.</t8021>
<t8022>"Yes, that's right," confirmed Defarge once again.</t8022>
<t8023>"Then go and tell 'Wind' and 'Fire' where they should stop," replied the lady; "not me.</t8023><t8024>"</t8024>
<t8025>Both listeners took a dreadful pleasure in the woman's deadly nature of anger – the other listener could sense that the woman had turned deathly pale even without seeing her – and both received it with deep respect.</t8025> <t8026>Defarge, as the powerless minority, attempted to say a few words reminding of the Marquis' compassionate wife; but his wife merely repeated her last words.</t8026> <t8027>"Go tell 'Wind' and 'Fire' where they should stop, not me.</t8027><t8028>"</t8028>
<t8029>Customers entered and the group dispersed.</t8029> <t8030>The English customer paid for what he drank, counted the coins with a bewildered expression, and as a foreigner.</t8030> <t8031>He asked how he could get to the National Palace.</t8031> <t8032>Madame Defarge escorted him to the door and pointed in the direction he should go, holding his arm.</t8032> <t8033>At that moment, what crossed the English customer's mind was how good it would be to grab that arm, lift it, and deliver a hard and deep stab underneath it.</t8033>
<t8034>Ama yoluna devam etti ve çok geçmeden hapishane duvarının gölgesinde kayboldu.</t8034> <t8035>Kararlaştırdıkları saatte bu gölgeden çıkarak tekrar Mr. Lorry'nin evine vardığında yaşlı adamı huzursuz bir sıkıntı içinde odanın içinde bir aşağı bir yukarı yürürken buldu.</t8035> <t8036>Şu ana dek Lucie ile olduğunu ve onun yanından bu randevuya gelebilmek için birkaç dakikalığına ayrıldığını söyledi.</t8036> <t8037>Lucie'nin babası dörde doğru bankadan çıkmış ve bir daha görünmemişti.</t8037> <t8038>Babasının arabuluculuğunun Charles'ı kurtaracağına dair bir ümidi vardı Lucie'nin, ama bu yok denecek kadar azdı.</t8038> <t8039>Babası gideli beş saati geçmişti.</t8039> <t8040>Nerede olabilirdi?</t8040>
<t8041>Mr. Lorry waited until ten o'clock; but Doctor Manette did not come, and since he did not want to leave Lucie alone any longer, they decided it would be a good idea for Mr. Lorry to return to her and come back to the bank at midnight.</t8041> <t8042>In the meantime, Carton would wait by the fireplace for the Doctor.</t8042>
<t8043>Carton waited and waited, the clock struck twelve; but the Doctor was nowhere to be seen.</t8043> <t8044>When Mr. Lorry returned, he had neither heard from him nor brought any news.</t8044> <t8045>Where could he be?</t8045>
<t8046>They were trying to find the answer to this question, and just as a faint hope began to sprout within them during the Doctor's prolonged absence, they heard his voice on the stairs.</t8046> <t8047>As soon as he entered, they realized that everything was lost.</t8047>
<t8048>Had he really gone to see someone, or had he just wandered the streets all this time, it's unknown.</t8048> <t8049>While standing and looking at them, they didn't ask him anything, for his face told everything.</t8049>
<t8050>"I couldn't find it," said the Doctor, "I absolutely must find it.</t8050> <t8051>Where is it?</t8051><t8052>"</t8052>
<t8053>Her head and neck were uncovered, and with a helpless expression in her eyes, she took off her coat and threw it on the floor while speaking.</t8053>
<t8054>"Where is my workbench?</t8054> <t8055>I looked everywhere but couldn't find my workbench.</t8055> <t8056>What happened to the tasks I had?</t8056> <t8057>I don't have much time left.</t8057> <t8058>I need to finish those shoes.</t8058><t8059>"</t8059>
<t8060>Mr. Lorry and Carton looked at each other and their hearts broke.</t8060>
<t8061>"Come on!" said the Doctor, whining in a miserable state; "let me get back to my work.</t8061> <t8062>Give me my bench.</t8062><t8063>"</t8063>
<t8064>When he received no response, he started pulling his hair and stomping his foot like a child gone mad.</t8064>
<t8065>He cried out in a heart-wrenching manner, "Stop tormenting that poor man already," he pleaded with them; "give me back my workbench already!</t8065> <t8066>If I can't finish those shoes tonight, what will we do then?</t8066><t8067>"</t8067>
<t8068>He had completely lost himself!</t8068>
<t8069>It was so clear that talking to him rationally or trying to bring him to his senses would be of no use – as if they had agreed among themselves – both of them placed their hands soothingly on the Doctor's shoulder and sat him down in front of the fire, telling him that his workbench would be brought to him shortly.</t8069> <t8070>The Doctor sank into the chair, gazing at the embers, and fell into deep thoughts, crying uncontrollably.</t8070> <t8071>As if everything that had happened since those days in the attic was just a fleeting dream or illusion, Mr. Lorry watched him shrink back into the state he was in while staying with Defarge.</t8071>
<t8072>Even though both were horrified and deeply affected by this desolate scene, it was not the time to succumb to such emotions.</t8072> <t8073>They thought of the utterly alone Lucie, who had lost her last hope and confidence.</t8073> <t8074>As if they had agreed once again, they looked at each other with the same expression on their faces.</t8074> <t8075>Carton was the first to speak:</t8075>
<t8076>"Our last hope has also ended, it wasn't much anyway.</t8076> <t8077>Yes, the best thing is to take him to his daughter.</t8077> <t8078>But before you go, will you carefully listen to what I have to say?</t8078> <t8079>But don't ask why I will propose these conditions and why I will ask you to promise me; there is a reason – and a good one at that.</t8079><t8080>"</t8080>
<t8081>"I'm sure it is," replied Mr. Lorry.</t8081> <t8082>"Please continue.</t8082><t8083>"</t8083>
<t8084>Meanwhile, the person sitting in the seat between them was monotonously rocking back and forth and groaning.</t8084> <t8085>They were speaking in low voices as if they were at the bedside of a patient at night.</t8085>
<t8086>Carton bent down to pick up the coat that was lying under his feet.</t8086> <t8087>At that moment, the small case in which the Doctor carried the list of his daily tasks fell to the ground.</t8087> <t8088>When Carton picked it up, he saw a folded paper inside.</t8088>
<t8089>"We need to look at this!" he said.</t8089> <t8090>Mr. Lorry nodded in agreement.</t8090> <t8091>Carton opened the paper and exclaimed, "Thank God!"</t8091>
<t8092>"What is it?" asked Mr. Lorry, curiously.</t8092>
<t8093>"One minute! With your permission, let me explain this when the time comes," said Carton, and he put his hand into the pocket of his coat and took out another paper, "now this is the document that will allow me to leave this city.</t8093> <t8094>Look what it says – Sydney Carton, English, right?</t8094><t8095>"</t8095>
<t8096>Mr. Lorry took the document and fixed his eyes on Carton's excited face.</t8096>
<t8097>"Please keep this for me until tomorrow.</t8097> <t8098>You know I am going to see him tomorrow, and it would be better if I didn't have this with me when I go to the prison.</t8098><t8099>"</t8099>
<t8100>"Why?</t8100><t8101>"</t8101>
<t8102>"I don't know; I found it appropriate not to take it.</t8102> <t8103>Now take this paper that Doctor Manette carries with him.</t8103> <t8104>This is a document, just like mine, that will allow the Doctor, his daughter, and his grandchild to pass the barrier and the border whenever they want; do you understand?</t8104><t8105>"</t8105>
<t8106>"Yes!"</t8106>
<t8107>"Maybe he did this as a last precaution against all the disasters that befell them yesterday.</t8107> <t8108>Is there a date on it?</t8108> <t8109>But it doesn't matter; no need to look; put mine next to theirs.</t8109> <t8110>Now look!</t8110> <t8111>Until an hour or two ago, I didn't think he had or could have such a document.</t8111> <t8112>This is very good, that is, until it is canceled.</t8112> <t8113>It could be canceled soon because I have valid reasons to think so.</t8113><t8114>"</t8114>
<t8115>"They are not in danger, are they?</t8115><t8116>"</t8116>
<t8117>"They are facing a very great danger.</t8117> <t8118>The danger is something like Madam Defarge denouncing them.</t8118> <t8119>I heard this from her own mouth.</t8119> <t8120>According to the words I overheard tonight, they are in big trouble.</t8120> <t8121>I found the spy without wasting any time.</t8121> <t8122>He confirmed what I said.</t8122> <t8123>He mentioned that a sawyer living near the prison wall was Defarge's man and that this man had told Madam Defarge about the woman who frequently signaled to the prisoners –Carton had not mentioned Lucie's name–.</t8123> <t8124>It is not hard to see that they will be subjected to an ordinary accusation, a prison conspiracy; such an accusation could cost them their lives –perhaps even the child's and maybe the father's too– because both of them have been seen there, beside her.</t8124> <t8125>Do not be afraid.</t8125> <t8126>You will save them all.</t8126><t8127>"</t8127>
<t8128>"I wish I could save Carton! But how?</t8128><t8129>"</t8129>
<t8130>"I will tell you how it will be.</t8130> <t8131>This depends on you, and no one else can save them but you.</t8131> <t8132>This new report won't be made by tomorrow; it will probably take two or three days; maybe even a week.</t8132> <t8133>You know, mourning and crying for the guillotine's criminals is a great crime.</t8133> <t8134>It is as clear as day that he and his father will commit this crime, and this woman will wait to add this heavy accusation to her charges, then she will show them as guilty.</t8134> <t8135>Were you able to follow me?</t8135><t8136>"</t8136>
<t8137>"You speak so carefully and so confidently," said Mr. Lorry, touching the back of the Doctor's chair, "for a moment I even forgot the pain inside me.</t8137><t8138>"</t8138>
<t8139>"You have money and can obtain the necessary things as soon as you can travel to the opposite shore.</t8139> <t8140>Your preparations for the return to England were already complete.</t8140> <t8141>Have your horses ready early tomorrow, so you can set off at two in the afternoon.</t8141><t8142>"</t8142>
<t8143>"Alright!"</t8143><t8144>"</t8144>
<t8145>Carton was in such an enthusiastic and excited state that this fire had also engulfed Mr. Lorry, suddenly making him feel younger and more lively.</t8145>
<t8146>"You have a noble heart.</t8146> <t8147>Did I mention that there couldn't be a better man for this job than you?</t8147> <t8148>Tonight, tell her about the danger she is in, which also includes her child and her father.</t8148> <t8149>Emphasize this well, or else she will gladly lay her beautiful head next to her husband's."</t8149> <t8150>After a moment of hesitation, he continued as before.</t8150> <t8151>"For the sake of her child and her father, convince her that it is essential to leave Paris with you all at that hour.</t8151> <t8152>Tell her that this is her husband's last wish.</t8152> <t8153>Tell her that much more than she thinks or hopes depends on this.</t8153> <t8154>Do you think her father, in his current state of distress, would follow her advice?"</t8154>
<t8155>"I'm sure of this.</t8155><t8156>"</t8156>
<t8157>"I thought the same."</t8157> <t8158>"Make your preparations in the courtyard here, quietly and quickly, and even take your place in the car."</t8158> <t8159>"As soon as I come to you, you will let me in and we will set off."</t8159><t8160>"</t8160>
<t8161>"Whatever happens, we should wait for you, is that right?</t8161><t8162>"</t8162>
<t8163>"You know you have my exit document along with the others, make sure to reserve my spot.</t8163> <t8164>Just wait for me to arrive, then straight to England!</t8164><t8165>"</t8165>
<t8166>"Well, then," said Mr. Lorry, shaking Carton's excited but firm and strong hand, "this matter does not depend solely on an old man like me, because there will be a young and eager man by my side.</t8166><t8167>"</t8167>
<t8168>"With God's help, everything will happen!"</t8168> <t8169>"Now, please promise me that you will not change this plan we have made, no matter what."</t8169><t8170>"</t8170>
<t8171>"I promise, Carton."</t8171><t8172>"</t8172>
<t8173>"Do not forget these words tomorrow; for whatever reason, if there is any change or delay in our plan, no one's life will be saved and unfortunately, many lives will be wasted."</t8173><t8174>"</t8174>
<t8175>"I will not forget.</t8175> <t8176>I will try to fulfill my part exactly.</t8176><t8177>"</t8177>
<t8178>"I hope I can do it too.</t8178> <t8179>Goodbye!"</t8179>
<t8180>Carton said these words with a sincere and dignified smile, and even kissed the old man's hand, but he did not leave his side immediately.</t8180> <t8181>He helped Mr. Lorry to lift the swaying body from in front of the dying embers, to put on his coat and hat, and to persuade this person, who was groaning and pleading about his bench and work, to go outside to find them.</t8181> <t8182>He walked beside him and supported him by directing him to the courtyard of the house; his sorrowful heart was watching the dreadful night – whereas once, when he opened his own ruined heart to him, he was so happy.</t8182> <t8183>Carton entered the courtyard and, looking at the light of his window, waited there for a few minutes.</t8183> <t8184>Before leaving, with his eyes still on the light, he prayed silently for him and said, "Farewell," to him.</t8184>
<t8185>Thirteen</t8185>
<t8186>Fifty Two</t8186>
<t8187>In the dark prison of the Conciergerie, the prisoners of the day were awaiting their fate.</t8187> <t8188>Their number was as many as the weeks in a year.</t8188> <t8189>These fifty-two people would be swept away that afternoon by the tide of life in the city into the vast and immortal sea.</t8189> <t8190>Even before their cells were emptied, they had found new occupants; before their blood could mix with the blood spilled the previous day, it would mix with the blood to be spilled the next day.</t8190>
<t8191>Two people's names were read aloud.</t8191> <t8192>Among them were many individuals, ranging from the seventy-year-old landowner whose immense wealth was not enough to buy his own life, to the twenty-year-old seamstress whose poverty and invisibility were not enough to save her.</t8192> <t8193>The diseases born from the evils and neglect affected all the victims equally; that dreadful moral decay, the unbearable pressure born from unspeakable hardships, and the heartless indifference struck everyone in the same way without any discrimination.</t8193>
<t8194>Charles Darnay, who was waiting alone in his cell, had not indulged in any idle fantasies since he came from the trial.</t8194> <t8195>In every line of the read statement, he had heard his own condemnation.</t8195> <t8196>He had understood very well that no individual effort would be enough to save him, that he was judged by millions, and that individual efforts would be of no use.</t8196>
<t8197>On the other hand, enduring all this was not easy while the face of his beloved wife was on his mind.</t8197> <t8198>He was tightly bound to life, and loosening this bond was difficult; if he tried to loosen it slightly from one point, it would strengthen even more at another point; even if he managed to break it with all his might, it would soon reattach.</t8198> <t8199>There was also an urgency in his thoughts, his heart was beating with great excitement and anger, resisting to not submit to his fate.</t8199> <t8200>If for a moment he seemed to submit to his fate, his wife and child, who would be left behind, would object, pointing out how selfish this situation was.</t8200>
<t8201>But all these were his initial feelings.</t8201> <t8202>Soon, the idea that the fate awaiting him was not something to be ashamed of, that many people were driven to this unjust path every day and faced it bravely, gave him strength.</t8202> <t8203>What followed was the thought that the inner peace and comfort of his loved ones depended on his own calm composure.</t8203> <t8204>Thus, as a result of these positive thoughts, Charles was able to gradually relax and calm down a bit.</t8204>
<t8205>These were the last thoughts wandering in his mind before night fell and everything turned dark, following his conviction.</t8205> <t8206>Since he had permission to get materials and light for writing, he sat down to write until the dungeon lanterns went out.</t8206>
<t8207>He wrote a long letter to Lucie, explaining that until he heard from her, he knew nothing about his father's imprisonment, just like her, he was unaware of his father's and uncle's involvement in this disaster, and he learned about it when the paper was read.</t8207> <t8208>He had already explained to her that the reason he hid the name he had stopped using was because it was a condition set by his father before their engagement – the reason for this was now understood – and that he still insisted on this on the morning of their wedding.</t8208> <t8209>For the sake of his father, he begged his wife never to ask his father whether he had forgotten about the existence of this paper or whether he remembered it during the story of the tower told under that beautiful old plane tree in the garden on a Sunday.</t8209> <t8210>Even if it had occurred to him, he undoubtedly assumed it had been destroyed along with the Bastille, because among the belongings of the prisoners that the public disclosed, there was no mention of this writing.</t8210> <t8211>Using every conceivable means, he asked his wife to comfort his father by reiterating that there was no need for him to blame himself, only that he had forgotten himself for their well-being and unity – adding that there was no need to say this.</t8211> <t8212>Then he begged her not to forget how much he loved her and how grateful he was to her, to bury her sorrow and dedicate herself to their beloved children and to comforting his father, saying that they would one day be reunited in heaven.</t8212>
<t8213>He wrote a letter to Lucie's father in the same tone and expressed that he particularly entrusted his wife and child to him.</t8213> <t8214>The reason he emphasized this so much was his hope to keep him away from a potential state of despair and negative thoughts about the past.</t8214>
<t8215>In the letter he wrote to Mr. Lorry, he entrusted everything to him and provided explanations regarding worldly matters.</t8215> <t8216>Then, adding sentences expressing how grateful he was for his friendship and warm interest, he finished the letter, and everything was over.</t8216> <t8217>Carton never crossed his mind.</t8217> <t8218>His mind was so occupied with others that he didn't think of him even for a moment.</t8218>
<t8219>He had managed to finish all these letters before the lamps were extinguished.</t8219> <t8220>When he lay down on his bed, he thought that his work in this world was over.</t8220>
<t8221>However, the world in its slumber called him back and showed itself to him in all its brilliance.</t8221> <t8222>Free and happy, he was back in the old house in Soho (though nothing inside matched the reality), with an incredible sense of peace and relief, he was with Lucie again, and his wife was telling him that it had all been a dream and that he hadn't gone anywhere.</t8222> <t8223>A sleep interval where he remembered nothing, then he saw the pains he had endured and returned to his wife's side, dead but peaceful, and there was no difference in between.</t8223> <t8224>Then another interval where he remembered nothing, and then he opened his eyes to a gloomy morning, unable to understand where he was or what he was for a moment, until that thought flashed in his mind, "Today is my execution day!</t8224><t8225>"</t8225>
<t8226>That's why the hours had passed like this until the day fifty-two heads would be cut off.</t8226> <t8227>Now, no matter how calm he was and hoped to face death with quiet heroism, a new idea, which was very difficult to control, had begun to emerge in his mind.</t8227>
<t8228>He had never seen the device that would end his life before.</t8228> <t8229>How high was it from the ground, how many steps did it have, where would he stand, how would they touch him, would the hands that touched him be stained red, which way would his face be turned, would he go first or last?</t8229> <t8230>These and many similar questions kept swirling in his mind, beyond his control, refusing to leave his thoughts.</t8230> <t8231>None of them stemmed from fear; there was no specific fear within him.</t8231> <t8232>Rather, it was an unsettling and strange desire to know what to do when the time came, and this desire was much greater compared to the brief time he would spend there; it was as if there was another soul within him wanting to learn all these things.</t8232>
<t8233>As he paced back and forth in his cell, time was slipping away, the hours striking minutes he would never hear again.</t8233> <t8234>Nine passed, ten passed, eleven passed, and twelve was approaching to pass forever as well.</t8234> <t8235>After struggling with all these confusing thoughts for quite a while, he regained some composure.</t8235> <t8236>Then, softly repeating their names, he walked up and down.</t8236> <t8237>The most challenging part of the inner struggle had ended.</t8237> <t8238>Setting aside the dreams that clouded his mind, he was able to walk up and down, praying for himself and his loved ones.</t8238>
<t8239>Twelve went on forever.</t8239>
<t8240>He had been told that he would be taken at three o'clock; but he knew he would be called earlier because the cars were moving very slowly and heavily on the streets.</t8240> <t8241>Therefore, he prepared himself for two o'clock; this way, he would have time to both strengthen himself and give strength to others.</t8241>
<t8242>With his hands clasped on his chest, he walked back and forth with steady steps.</t8242> <t8243>He was a different man from the prisoner walking back and forth in La Force, and he was not surprised when he heard the clock strike one.</t8243> <t8244>This was no different from other hours.</t8244> <t8245>Thanking God with great sincerity for being able to pull himself together, he thought, "Now there's just one hour left," and turned around to continue walking.</t8245>
<t8246>Then, he heard footsteps in the stone passage.</t8246> <t8247>He paused his walk.</t8247>
<t8248>The key was inserted into the lock and turned.</t8248> <t8249>Before the door opened or just as it was opening, a man said in a low voice in English, "You never saw me here; we didn't meet.</t8249> <t8250>Now go alone; I will wait here.</t8250> <t8251>Come on, don't waste time!</t8251><t8252>"</t8252>
<t8253>The door had quickly opened and closed, and standing directly opposite, silently and resolutely, with a sparkling smile on his face, and his finger brought to his lips as if to warn for silence, was Sydney Carton.</t8253>
<t8254>His gaze was so bright and impressive that, at first, the prisoner thought he was his own imagination.</t8254> <t8255>But when he opened his mouth, he realized it was his voice; Carton took the prisoner's hand, and the hand that grasped his was indeed his own.</t8255>
<t8256>"I was probably the last person you expected to see, wasn't I?" said Carton.</t8256>
<t8257>"I can't believe I'm seeing you.</t8257> <t8258>I really can't believe it.</t8258> <t8259>Or have you also" –he suddenly became worried– "been condemned?</t8259><t8260>"</t8260>
<t8261>"No.</t8261> <t8262>By a stroke of luck, I managed to influence one of the guards here, and that's why I'm standing before you now.</t8262> <t8263>I'm coming from her side now – from your wife's side, dear Darnay.</t8263><t8264>"</t8264>
<t8265>The prisoner rubbed his hands.</t8265>
<t8266>"Your wife has a request from you."</t8266><t8267>"</t8267>
<t8268>"What is it?</t8268><t8269>"</t8269>
<t8270>"With that touching voice you know and love so well, in the most heartfelt manner, persistently and stubbornly, they are begging you."</t8270><t8271>"</t8271>
<t8272>The prisoner slightly turned his head to the side.</t8272>
<t8273>"I don't have time to explain why I'm telling you this or what it means.</t8273> <t8274>You just need to do what I say – now take off your boots and put on mine.</t8274><t8275>"</t8275>
<t8276>There was a chair leaning against the wall behind the prisoner.</t8276> <t8277>Carton lunged forward, pushed him onto it at lightning speed, and stood barefoot at his head.</t8277>
<t8278>"Put on my boots.</t8278> <t8279>Be quick; hurry up.</t8279> <t8280>Quick!"</t8280>
<t8281>"Carton, there's no escape from here; we can never do this.</t8281> <t8282>You will die with me.</t8282> <t8283>This is madness.</t8283><t8284>"</t8284>
<t8285>"If I had asked you to run away with me, it would have been madness; but did I say such a thing?</t8285> <t8286>If I ask you to walk out that door, then tell me it's madness and wait for the scrap.</t8286> <t8287>Take off your tie and put on mine, take off your coat and wear mine.</t8287> <t8288>While you are changing these, I will take off that ribbon on your head and you also mess up your hair like mine!</t8288><t8289>"</t8289>
<t8290>It was with tremendous speed, a supernatural will, and an efficient power that all this was accomplished by Darnay.</t8290> <t8291>The prisoner was like a child in his hands.</t8291>
<t8292>"Carton! Dear Carton! This is madness.</t8292> <t8293>We will never succeed, we can never do this, it was tried before but no one succeeded.</t8293> <t8294>I beg you, do not add your own death to the pity.</t8294><t8295>"</t8295>
<t8296>"Do I want you to step out of that door, Darnay?</t8296> <t8297>If I ask for such a thing, oppose me.</t8297> <t8298>There are pen, ink, and paper on that table.</t8298> <t8299>Can you write without your hand trembling?</t8299><t8300>"</t8300>
<t8301>"He wasn't trembling when he arrived.</t8301><t8302>"</t8302>
<t8303>"Gene, take a note of what I'm saying.</t8303> <t8304>Come on, buddy, hurry up!</t8304><t8305>"</t8305>
<t8306>Darnay sat holding his head in a state of confusion.</t8306> <t8307>Carton, on the other hand, stood right next to him with his right hand in the breast pocket of his coat.</t8307>
<t8308>"Write exactly what I say.</t8308><t8309>"</t8309>
<t8310>"To whom shall I write?"</t8310><t8311>"</t8311>
<t8312>"To no one." Carton's hand was still on his chest.</t8312>
<t8313>"Shall I write history?"</t8313><t8314>"</t8314>
<t8315>"No.</t8315><t8316>"</t8316>
<t8317>The prisoner was looking up at every question.</t8317> <t8318>Carton, with his hand in his pocket, was looking down at him.</t8318>
<t8319>"If you remember the conversation we had a long time ago," said Carton, slowly, "you will immediately understand what it means.</t8319> <t8320>You definitely remember it, I know.</t8320> <t8321>Forgetting is not something you would do.</t8321><t8322>"</t8322>
<t8323>At this moment, Carton took his hand out of the pocket on his chest; the prisoner, taking advantage of the opportunity, lifted his head and looked at him with anxious curiosity and noticed that he had something in his hand.</t8323>
<t8324>"It's not for you, have you written it?" asked Carton.</t8324>
<t8325>"I wrote, do you have a gun in your hand?</t8325><t8326>"</t8326>
<t8327>"No, I don't have any weapons on me.</t8327><t8328>"</t8328>
<t8329>"What do you have in your hand then?</t8329><t8330>"</t8330>
<t8331>"You will learn soon."</t8331> <t8332>"Keep writing; it's almost done."</t8332> <t8333>Then he dictated again.</t8333> <t8334>"I am very happy to see the days when I can prove the truth of my words."</t8334> <t8335>"Don't be upset or distressed because I did this."</t8335> <t8336>While saying these words, his hand slowly, gently descended to the prisoner's face, his eyes fixed on him.</t8336>
<t8337>The pen fell from Darnay's fingers onto the table, and Darnay looked at Carton with empty eyes.</t8337>
<t8338>"Where did this mist come from?" he asked.</t8338>
<t8339>"What is this steam?</t8339><t8340>"</t8340>
<t8341>"Something passed before my eyes.</t8341><t8342>"</t8342>
<t8343>"Did I smell something?"</t8343><t8344>"</t8344>
<t8345>"I didn't notice anything; but such a thing can't happen here.</t8345> <t8346>Take the pen and finish this.</t8346> <t8347>Hurry up, come on!</t8347><t8348>"</t8348>
<t8349>The prisoner, who seemed to have his memory damaged or lost his faculties, tried to concentrate.</t8349> <t8350>With blurred eyes, barely breathing, he looked at Carton, who –with his hand again on his chest– was staring back at him intently.</t8350>
<t8351>"Come on, hurry up!"</t8351>
<t8352>The prisoner leaned over the paper once more.</t8352>
<t8353>"If it had been otherwise," said Carton as his hand slowly, carefully descended again; "I would not have seized that great opportunity.</t8353> <t8354>If it had been otherwise," and his hand was now in front of the prisoner's face; "There would be many more questions I would have to answer.</t8354> <t8355>If it had been otherwise..."</t8355> <t8356>Carton looked at the pen and saw that the writing was gradually turning into illegible marks.</t8356>
<t8357>Carton did not bring his hand to his chest again.</t8357> <t8358>The prisoner sprang up with a reproachful look, but Carton immediately clamped his hand over the prisoner's nostrils and wrapped his left arm around his waist, holding him tightly.</t8358> <t8359>Darnay struggled faintly with the man who was risking his life for him; but soon he lost consciousness and collapsed to the ground.</t8359>
<t8360>Carton, with hands as faithful to his purpose as his heart, quickly donned the clothes the prisoner had set aside and tied his hair back with the prisoner's ribbon.</t8360> <t8361>Then he called out quietly, "Come in!</t8361> <t8362>Come on!" and the Spy entered.</t8362>
<t8363>Carton, who was kneeling beside the man lying in a state of unconsciousness, lifted his head and said, "Did you see?" as he tucked the letter into his bosom, "how great the danger you are in is."</t8363><t8364>"</t8364>
<t8365>"Mr. Carton," said the Spy, snapping his fingers in an embarrassed manner, "if you stick to the bargain we made, I won't get into trouble."</t8365><t8366>"</t8366>
<t8367>"Don't be afraid.</t8367> <t8368>I am faithful to my word until death.</t8368><t8369>"</t8369>
<t8370>"If these fifty-two stories are true, you must already keep your word, Mr. Carton.</t8370> <t8371>If you can get through this situation in these clothes, there is nothing to fear.</t8371><t8372>"</t8372>
<t8373>"Don't be afraid! Soon, I won't be in a position to harm you, and hopefully, the others will have left here too! Now, someone help put 'me' in the car."</t8373><t8374>"</t8374>
<t8375>"You?" asked the Spy, nervously.</t8375>
<t8376>"Him," I say, "the man I switched places with.</t8376> <t8377>Will you leave through the door you brought me in from?</t8377><t8378>"</t8378>
<t8379>"Yes.</t8379><t8380>"</t8380>
<t8381>"When you brought me here, I felt weak and exhausted, and now as I leave, I feel even more exhausted.</t8381> <t8382>This farewell scene has worn me out too much.</t8382> <t8383>Such scenes must happen frequently here.</t8383> <t8384>Life is in your own hands.</t8384> <t8385>Hurry up! Call for help!</t8385><t8386>"</t8386>
<t8387>The spy, trembling all over, paused for a moment and asked, "Do you swear not to betray me?"</t8387>
<t8388>Carton stomped his foot and said, "What are you talking about! Didn't I swear earlier that I would handle this, why are you wasting these precious minutes now?</t8388> <t8389>Take him to the courtyard we talked about, place him in the carriage yourself, hand him over to Mr. Lorry and tell him not to give any stimulants, that fresh air will be enough, and to remember what I said the last night and the promise he made to me, then leave quickly!</t8389><t8390>"</t8390>
<t8391>The spy left and Carton sat at the head of the table, resting his hands on his forehead.</t8391> <t8392>The spy returned immediately with two men beside him.</t8392>
<t8393>One of them, looking at the body lying on the ground, said, "What happened to this man?"</t8393> <t8394>"Did he find out that his friend won the grand prize in the 'Saint Guillotine lottery'?</t8394><t8395>"</t8395>
<t8396>"If nothing had come out of the lottery for the aristocrat, a good patriot could not have been more saddened," said the other.</t8396>
<t8397>They lifted the unconscious body, laid it on the stretcher they had left in front of the door, and bent down to take it away.</t8397>
<t8398>"We don't have much time, Evremonde," said the Spy, as if warning.</t8398>
<t8399>"I know," said Carton.</t8399> <t8400>"Please take care of my friend, now leave me alone.</t8400><t8401>"</t8401>
<t8402>"Alright then, children," said Barsad.</t8402> <t8403>"Lift it up and let's go already!</t8403><t8404>"</t8404>
<t8405>The door closed and Carton was left alone.</t8405> <t8406>He listened intently outside to hear any suspicious situation or any sound suggesting danger.</t8406> <t8407>There was no sound.</t8407> <t8408>Locks turned, doors closed, footsteps passing through distant corridors were heard; no scream arose, nor was there any unusual commotion.</t8408> <t8409>Soon, when he started to breathe a bit more comfortably, he sat down at the table again and listened until the clock struck two.</t8409>
<t8410>Then some sounds rose, but Carton was not afraid because he knew what they were.</t8410> <t8411>Doors opened one after another, and finally, it was his turn.</t8411> <t8412>A guard, with a list in hand, looked inside and simply said, "Follow me, Evremonde!" and took him to a large dark room in the distance.</t8412> <t8413>It was a dark winter day, and Carton could barely make out the other prisoners, who had been brought in with their arms bound, in the gloom both inside and outside.</t8413> <t8414>Some were standing; some were sitting.</t8414> <t8415>Some were crying and wailing, unable to stay still, but they were few in number.</t8415> <t8416>The vast majority were silent and had fixed their eyes on the ground without moving.</t8416>
<t8417>Leaning against a wall in a dark corner, watching those brought in after him among fifty-two people, a man passing in front of him stopped and wanted to hug him as if he knew him.</t8417> <t8418>Carton panicked, thinking the man would notice the situation; but the man continued on his way.</t8418> <t8419>Shortly after, a young woman with a delicate young girl's body, with a pale, charming, and thin face and wide-open eyes full of patience, got up from the place where Carton had just been observing and came to talk to him.</t8419>
<t8420>"Citizen Evremonde," he said, touching him with his cold hand, "I am the poor little tailor who stayed with you in La Force, do you remember?</t8420><t8421>"</t8421>
<t8422>Carton murmured in response: "Correct.</t8422> <t8423>But I have forgotten what you are accused of.</t8423><t8424>"</t8424>
<t8425>"With plotting a conspiracy.</t8425> <t8426>But God knows, I haven't committed any crime.</t8426> <t8427>Can such a thing be possible?</t8427> <t8428>Who would think of plotting a conspiracy with a poor and small creature like me?</t8428><t8429>"</t8429>
<t8430>As she said this, the sad smile that appeared on the woman's face touched Carton so deeply that tears began to flow from his eyes.</t8430>
<t8431>"I am not afraid of death, Citizen Evremonde, but I have done nothing.</t8431> <t8432>If my death will benefit the Republic, which will bring a smile to the faces of poor people like us, I certainly do not mind death; but I do not know how this will happen, Citizen Evremonde.</t8432> <t8433>After all, I am just a poor little creature!</t8433><t8434>"</t8434>
<t8435>In this life, the last thing that would warm and ache your heart was this poor girl who warmed and ached Carton's heart.</t8435>
<t8436>"I had heard that you were released, Citizen Evremonde.</t8436> <t8437>If only it were true!</t8437><t8438>"</t8438>
<t8439>"It was like that.</t8439> <t8440>But then I was caught again and sentenced.</t8440><t8441>"</t8441>
<t8442>"Citizen Evremonde, if we end up in the same carriage, may I hold your hand?</t8442> <t8443>I am not afraid, but I am small and weak, it will give me courage.</t8443><t8444>"</t8444>
<t8445>When patience-filled eyes turned to his face, Carton saw a sudden doubt in them, followed by astonishment.</t8445> <t8446>He held the young fingers, worn from work and hunger, and brought them to his lips.</t8446>
<t8447>"Are you sacrificing yourself for him?</t8447><t8448>"</t8448>
<t8449>"For his wife and child too.</t8449> <t8450>Shh! Yes.</t8450><t8451>"</t8451>
<t8452>"Ah, allow me to hold your brave hand, stranger!</t8452><t8453>"</t8453>
<t8454>"Shh! Alright, my poor brother, hold my hand until the very end.</t8454><t8455>"</t8455>
<t8456>When the shadows falling over the prison fell upon the barricades surrounded by crowds at the same hours in the afternoon, a car that had set out to leave Paris was stopped for inspection.</t8456>
<t8457>"Who are you?</t8457> <t8458>Who are the people with you?</t8458> <t8459>Let's see your documents!</t8459><t8460>"</t8460>
<t8461>The documents were handed over and he read them.</t8461>
<t8462>"Alexandre Manette.</t8462> <t8463>Doctor.</t8463> <t8464>French.</t8464> <t8465>Which one of you is this?</t8465><t8466>"</t8466>
<t8467>Here it is; the old man, who is muttering and babbling incomprehensible things, is pointed out.</t8467>
<t8468>"It seems that Citizen Doctor is not quite in his right mind, is he?</t8468> <t8469>The revolution's fire must have been too much for him.</t8469><t8470>"</t8470>
<t8471>Indeed, this was too much for him.</t8471>
<t8472>"Eh! Many people suffer from the same problem.</t8472> <t8473>His daughter Lucie.</t8473> <t8474>French.</t8474> <t8475>Who is this?" That's it.</t8475>
<t8476>"That's right, who else could it be?</t8476> <t8477>Lucie, the wife of Evremonde, isn't she?</t8477><t8478>"</t8478>
<t8479>Correct.</t8479>
<t8480>"Eh! Evremonde has an appointment elsewhere.</t8480> <t8481>Lucie, his daughter.</t8481> <t8482>English.</t8482> <t8483>That's it.</t8483><t8484>"</t8484>
<t8485>There it is, who else would be there?</t8485>
<t8486>"Kiss me, daughter of Evremonde.</t8486> <t8487>Now that you've kissed a good Republican, this is something new for your family; remember this! Sydney Carton.</t8487> <t8488>Lawyer.</t8488> <t8489>Englishman.</t8489> <t8490>Which one?" He is lying in a corner of the carriage.</t8490> <t8491>He is also pointed out.</t8491>
<t8492>"It seems the English lawyer has fainted, huh?</t8492><t8493>"</t8493>
<t8494>It is hoped that he will recover in the fresh air.</t8494> <t8495>It is explained to the attendant that he is not in good health and is experiencing the sorrow of parting from a friend who has been subjected to the wrath of the Republic.</t8495>
<t8496>"Is this the reason?</t8496> <t8497>This is not such an important thing!</t8497> <t8498>There are many who have faced the wrath of the Republic and had to look through that tiny guillotine window.</t8498> <t8499>Jarvis Lorry.</t8499> <t8500>Banker.</t8500> <t8501>Englishman.</t8501> <t8502>Who is this?</t8502><t8503>"</t8503>
<t8504>"It's me.</t8504> <t8505>I was the only one left anyway.</t8505><t8506>"</t8506>
<t8507>It was Jarvis Lorry who answered all these questions.</t8507> <t8508>He had gotten out of the carriage and answered a group of officials at the door.</t8508> <t8509>The men slowly walked around the carriage and then slowly climbed up to the coachman's seat to look at the luggage on top; the crowd swarming around the carriage was pushing each other at the door, peering inside with greedy eyes; a small child in his mother's arms was reaching out to touch the wife of an aristocrat on her way to the guillotine.</t8509>
<t8510>"Here are your documents, Jarvis Lorry, signed."</t8510><t8511>"</t8511>
<t8512>"Can we leave now, citizen?</t8512><t8513>"</t8513>
<t8514>"You may go.</t8514> <t8515>Come on, coachman! Have a good journey!</t8515><t8516>"</t8516>
<t8517>"Goodbye, fellow citizens.</t8517> <t8518>–Yes, we have overcome the first danger!</t8518><t8519>"</t8519>
<t8520>These words also belonged to Jarvis Lorry, who was looking up with his hands clasped.</t8520> <t8521>There was terror in the carriage, there were tears, and the heavy breath of the unconscious passenger filled the air.</t8521>
<t8522>Lucie grabbed the old man's arm and asked, "Aren't we going too slow?</t8522> <t8523>Can't we go faster?"</t8523>
<t8524>"Then we would look like we're running away, my dear.</t8524> <t8525>We shouldn't push them too hard; it would arouse suspicion later.</t8525><t8526>"</t8526>
<t8527>"Look back, are they following us?</t8527><t8528>"</t8528>
<t8529>"There is no one on the road, my beautiful child.</t8529> <t8530>They are not following us.</t8530><t8531>"</t8531>
<t8532>We pass by houses in twos and threes, deserted farms, dilapidated buildings, paint shops, and tanneries, and then through streets lined with wide fields and leafless trees.</t8532> <t8533>In front of us, randomly laid hard cobblestones, and on either side of us, soft and deep mud.</t8533> <t8534>Sometimes, to escape the stones that clatter and shake the carriage, we plunge into the mud at the edges; sometimes into the wheel tracks and puddles.</t8534> <t8535>At such moments, the torment of our impatience increases so much that, in a frantic rush and hurry to escape –and hide– we move forward without stopping.</t8535>
<t8536>We are passing again through wide fields, dilapidated buildings, deserted farms, dye houses, tanneries, and then again through streets covered with leafless trees where there are houses in twos and threes.</t8536> <t8537>Were these men deceiving us and taking us back by another route?</t8537> <t8538>Hadn't we passed through the same place before?</t8538> <t8539>Thank God, no.</t8539> <t8540>A village.</t8540> <t8541>Look back, look back and see if we are being followed?</t8541> <t8542>Shh! The resting place of the postal carriages.</t8542>
<t8543>Our four horses are slowly being untied from their reins; the carriage, without its horses and as if it will never move again, stands slowly on the tiny road; then slowly, one by one, new horses come into view; the old coachmen slowly count their money, making mistakes and coming up with improbable results.</t8543> <t8544>Throughout this entire time, our burdened hearts beat so fast that even the fastest horses in history couldn't make such a noise while galloping.</t8544>
<t8545>Soon, the new coachmen take their places and the old ones fall behind.</t8545> <t8546>We pass the village, climb the hill, descend, and then reach the low-lying wetlands.</t8546> <t8547>Suddenly, the coachmen's conversations become lively and cheerful, and they quickly pull the reins to stop the horses.</t8547> <t8548>Are we being followed?</t8548>
<t8549>"Hey! You in the car."</t8549> <t8550>"Tell me, let's see!"</t8550><t8551>"</t8551>
<t8552>"What?" asks Mr. Lorry, sticking his head out the window.</t8552>
<t8553>"How many were they?"</t8553><t8554>"</t8554>
<t8555>"I don't understand you.</t8555><t8556>"</t8556>
<t8557>"...</t8557> <t8558>In the last post.</t8558> <t8559>How many people went to the guillotine today?</t8559><t8560>"</t8560>
<t8561>"Fifty-two."</t8561><t8562>"</t8562>
<t8563>"I told you!</t8563> <t8564>The number is big!</t8564> <t8565>The guy next to me was saying forty-two; so it means ten more heads will roll.</t8565> <t8566>The guillotine will take care of them nicely.</t8566> <t8567>Very nice.</t8567> <t8568>Let's go then.</t8568> <t8569>Deeh!"</t8569>
<t8570>The night is falling pitch dark.</t8570> <t8571>The faint passenger is stirring; he has started to come to his senses and say understandable things; he still thinks you are beside him; he addresses you by name and asks what you are holding in your hand.</t8571> <t8572>Oh, Almighty God, please have mercy on us and help us!</t8572> <t8573>Be careful, look and see if they are following us.</t8573>
<t8574>The wind is chasing us, the clouds are flying after us, the moon is circling above us, and the wild night is pursuing us, but so far nothing else has followed us.</t8574>
<t8575>Fourteen</t8575>
<t8576>The Knitting is Finished</t8576>
<t8577>At the same hours, while fifty-two people awaited their fate, Madam Defarge, along with Jacques Three from the Committee of Vengeance and Revolution, had formed a dark and ominous council.</t8577> <t8578>Madam Defarge was meeting with these deputies not in the wine shop, but in the hut of the sawyer who was formerly a road worker.</t8578> <t8579>The sawyer did not personally attend this meeting; like a satellite that neither spoke unless asked nor expressed opinions unless solicited, he waited a little distance away.</t8579>
<t8580>"But our Defarge," said Jacques Three, "is undoubtedly a good Republican, isn't he?</t8580><t8581>"</t8581>
<t8582>Chatterbox Revenge shouted in a shrill voice, "There is no one better than him in France."</t8582>
<t8583>Madam Defarge, with her eyebrows slightly furrowed, brought her hand to her assistant's lips and said, "Calm down, Vengeance, listen to me carefully.</t8583> <t8584>Citizen husband, is a good Republican and a brave man; he has rendered great services to the Republic and has earned its trust.</t8584> <t8585>But he has some weaknesses, he is weak enough to show mercy to this Doctor.</t8585><t8586>"</t8586>
<t8587>Jacques Three shouted in a hoarse voice, "What a pity," and shook his head skeptically with his cruel fingers in his open mouth; "this is not befitting a good citizen at all; very bad.</t8587><t8588>"</t8588>
<t8589>"Look," said the madam, "I don't care about this Doctor at all.</t8589> <t8590>Whether his head stays or goes, it's all the same to me.</t8590> <t8591>But no one from the Evremonde family should remain; his wife and child should follow him.</t8591><t8592>"</t8592>
<t8593>Jacques Three shouted again in his hoarse voice, "The woman's head is too beautiful for this job."</t8593> <t8594>"I had seen blue eyes and blonde hair there before; when Samson lifted them, they looked magnificent."</t8594> <t8595>He spoke with all his cruelty, like a connoisseur of taste.</t8595>
<t8596>Madam Defarge lowered her eyes and thought for a while.</t8596>
<t8597>Jacques Üç, "Also, the child has blonde hair and blue eyes," he said with absent-minded pleasure, "and we don't often see children there.</t8597> <t8598>It's a pleasant sight!</t8598><t8599>"</t8599>
<t8600>Madam Defarge, "In short," she said, snapping out of her reverie, "I cannot trust my husband on this matter.</t8600> <t8601>I've been thinking since last night, and it's not a good idea to tell him the details of my plan. Moreover, if I delay, there's a danger that my husband might warn them, and thus they could escape.</t8601><t8602>"</t8602>
<t8603>"Such a thing must never happen," shouted Jacques Three; "no one should escape.</t8603> <t8604>We are only at half the number we want.</t8604> <t8605>A hundred and twenty heads must roll every day.</t8605><t8606>"</t8606>
<t8607>"In short," continued Madam Defarge, "my husband does not care as much as I do whether this whole family is exterminated, and I am not in a position to show understanding to the Doctor.</t8607> <t8608>Therefore, I must fend for myself.</t8608> <t8609>Come here, little citizen.</t8609><t8610>"</t8610>
<t8611>Under the influence of the mortal fear he felt, the sawyer, showing respect and obedience to the woman, approached with his red hat in hand.</t8611>
<t8612>Madam Defarge, "Little citizen, regarding the signals the woman sent to the prisoners," she said in a stern tone, "are you ready to testify?"</t8612><t8613>"</t8613>
<t8614>"Of course, why not!" shouted the sawyer.</t8614> <t8615>"The woman, regardless of snow or cold, sent signals every day from two to four o'clock, sometimes with a child, sometimes without.</t8615> <t8616>I know what it was.</t8616> <t8617>I saw it with my own eyes.</t8617><t8618>"</t8618>
<t8619>While saying these things, he made all sorts of hand and arm gestures, as if he were repeating some of the various signs he had never actually seen.</t8619>
<t8620>"It is clear that there is a conspiracy," said Jacques Three.</t8620> <t8621>"Very obvious!</t8621><t8622>"</t8622>
<t8623>Madam Defarge, with a sorrowful smile, turned her eyes to him and asked, "Well, what will the jury say to this?"</t8623>
<t8624>"You can trust the patriotic jury, dear citizen.</t8624> <t8625>I say this on behalf of my friends on the jury.</t8625><t8626>"</t8626>
<t8627>"Wait a moment," said Madam Defarge and fell into thoughts again.</t8627> <t8628>"Alright then!</t8628> <t8629>Shall we spare that Doctor for my husband's sake?</t8629> <t8630>For me, his presence or absence does not matter.</t8630> <t8631>But shall we spare him for my husband's sake?</t8631><t8632>"</t8632>
<t8633>"Another head for the doctor," said Jacques Three, in a low voice.</t8633> <t8634>"We haven't reached a sufficient number of heads yet; I think it would be a pity.</t8634><t8635>"</t8635>
<t8636>"When I saw him, he was also signaling next to his daughter," Madam Defarge supported; "it wouldn't be right to accuse the daughter and not the father; that's why I must not remain silent and should not place all the blame on this little citizen.</t8636> <t8637>I'm not a bad witness either.</t8637><t8638>"</t8638>
<t8639>Revenge and Jacques Three, heatedly objected and competed with each other to say that the madam was the most commendable and magnificent witness.</t8639> <t8640>The little citizen, on the other hand, claimed she was a divine witness in order not to be left out.</t8640>
<t8641>"Let the man try his luck," said Madam Defarge.</t8641> <t8642>"Alright, I won't keep him separate from the others!</t8642> <t8643>At three o'clock, you are on duty; you will go to watch the group to be executed today.</t8643> <t8644>–And you?</t8644><t8645>"</t8645>
<t8646>The question was directed at the sawyer, and he immediately responded positively.</t8646> <t8647>He was already looking for an opportunity to declare himself the most enthusiastic Republican, and if anything were to deprive him of the pleasure of puffing on his pipe while watching that peculiar national barber in the afternoon, he would turn into the most miserable Republican.</t8647> <t8648>His mannerisms were so exaggerated while saying these things that one might suspect he had small personal fears about his own safety at every moment (which, judging by the contemptuous dark eyes Madam Defarge fixed on him, was probably the case).</t8648>
<t8649>"Me too," said the madam, "I will be there.</t8649> <t8650>When the work is done – that is, around eight in the evening – come to me, to St Antoine, so we can report these to the people in my area.</t8650><t8651>"</t8651>
<t8652>The sawyer said he would be greatly honored and pleased to serve her.</t8652> <t8653>But then, feeling ashamed of her gaze, he scurried out of her sight like a small dog and retreated among his logs, taking up his saw to try to conceal the turmoil within him.</t8653>
<t8654>Madam Defarge signaled to the jury member and Revenge to come a little closer to the door and elaborated on her thoughts to them:</t8654>
<t8655>"His wife will arrive home soon, waiting for her husband's death.</t8655> <t8656>She mourns and sheds tears.</t8656> <t8657>She is now in a state of doubting the justice of the Republic.</t8657> <t8658>Therefore, she has sympathy for its enemies.</t8658> <t8659>I will go to her.</t8659><t8660>"</t8660>
<t8661>Jacques Üç, in a drunken state, exclaimed, "What a magnificent woman, what a magnificent woman!"</t8661> <t8662>Revenge also shouted, "Ah, you are a saint!" and embraced her.</t8662>
<t8663>Madam Defarge said, "Take my knitting," and handed it to her assistant, "and put it where I always sit."</t8663> <t8664>"Hold my usual chair for me."</t8664> <t8665>"Go there directly now, there might be a bigger crowd than usual today."</t8665><t8666>"</t8666>
<t8667>With enthusiasm for revenge, "I will gladly carry out your orders, chief," he said, kissing him on the cheeks.</t8667> <t8668>"You won't be late, right?</t8668><t8669>"</t8669>
<t8670>"I'll be out of there before they start.</t8670><t8671>"</t8671>
<t8672>Revenge, "Come before the cars arrive.</t8672> <t8673>Don't be late, my dear," he shouted after her, for madam had already turned into the street "before the cars arrive!"</t8673>
<t8674>Madam Defarge lightly waved her hand as if to indicate that she had heard and would be there on time, and trudged through the mud, turning the corner of the prison wall.</t8674> <t8675>As Madam walked away, Vengeance and the jury member, who were watching her, spoke with great admiration about her graceful demeanor and superior morals.</t8675>
<t8676>In that era, there were many women who had been worn down by the harsh effects of the times; but none were as terrifying as this ruthless woman who marched forward resolutely.</t8676> <t8677>Her strong and fearless character, solid intuition and swiftness, and tremendous determination not only made her appear stern and harsh but also allowed her beauty, which instinctively highlighted these traits, to become even more pronounced during these challenging times.</t8677> <t8678>Since childhood, she had turned into a tigress due to her contemplation of injustices and the class hatred that had taken root within her.</t8678> <t8679>There wasn't the slightest bit of mercy in her.</t8679> <t8680>If she ever possessed this virtue once, it was now completely gone.</t8680>
<t8681>It meant nothing to him that an innocent person was going to death because of the sins of their ancestors; it wasn't just him in front of him, they were all there.</t8681> <t8682>It also meant nothing to him that his wife would be a widow and his daughter an orphan; this punishment was too little, because they were his natural enemies and prey; therefore, they had no right to live.</t8682> <t8683>Since there was no mercy within him, there was no point in begging him, not even for himself.</t8683> <t8684>If he were to be defeated and laid low in one of those frequent struggles in the streets, he would not pity himself, or if he were to go to the guillotine tomorrow, he would feel nothing but the desire to send the man who sent him there to death in his place.</t8684>
<t8685>Here is Madam Defarge, carrying such a heart under that coarse attire.</t8685> <t8686>The outfit she wore carelessly suited her in a strange way, and her black hair looked much fuller under that cheap red cap.</t8686> <t8687>She had a loaded pistol hidden in her bosom.</t8687> <t8688>And a sharp dagger at her waist.</t8688> <t8689>Madam Defarge, fully equipped like this, moved through the streets with the confident demeanor of a character of this style and the agile ease of someone accustomed to walking barefoot and bare-legged on the beach since her girlhood.</t8689>
<t8690>While making plans for the carriage that was now waiting to take its final load and for this journey, the matter of how to take Miss Pross had greatly occupied Mr. Lorry's mind last night.</t8690> <t8691>This was necessary not only to avoid overloading the carriage but also to minimize the time spent during the inspection of the carriage and passengers at the barricades; for their escape could depend on the few seconds gained here and there.</t8691> <t8692>After a series of anxious thoughts, Mr. Lorry finally suggested that Miss Pross and Jerry, who had permits to leave the city, should depart at three o'clock by the fastest means available at that time.</t8692> <t8693>Since they had no luggage, they would catch up with them shortly, or even get ahead to prepare the horses in advance, and while everyone was in fear of being late, they would have made this journey in the valuable hours of the night much easier.</t8693>
<t8694>Miss Pross, who had the opportunity to provide a real service in this urgent and dangerous situation, welcomed all these arrangements with joy.</t8694> <t8695>Together with Jerry, they had seen the departure of the carriage, understood who the person brought by Solomon was, and after writhing in curiosity for about ten minutes, they had followed the carriage as the final stage of the plan. Meanwhile, Madam Defarge, advancing through the streets, was getting closer to the deserted house where all those plans were made.</t8695>
<t8696>"What do you think now, Mr. Cruncher?" said Miss Pross, she was so distressed that she could barely speak, stand, move, or even live; "Shouldn't we start our journey from this courtyard?</t8696> <t8697>A carriage already left from here today, it might arouse suspicion.</t8697><t8698>"</t8698>
<t8699>"If you ask me, madam," said Mr. Cruncher, "you are right.</t8699> <t8700>In the end, whether right or wrong, I will do whatever you say.</t8700><t8701>"</t8701>
<t8702>"I have such great fear and hope for our dear ones," said Miss Pross, exclaiming excitedly, "that I am not in a position to make any plans.</t8702> <t8703>Dear Mr. Cruncher, are you in a position to make a plan?</t8703><t8704>"</t8704>
<t8705>"Well ma'am, something like this might happen in the future," said Mr. Cruncher, "but right now, in my old age, I can't think of anything.</t8705> <t8706>Would you like to hear the two promises I made and the oaths I took during this difficult time, ma'am?</t8706><t8707>"</t8707>
<t8708>"Oh my God!" Miss Pross exclaimed excitedly again, "say it properly so we can continue on our way.</t8708><t8709>"</t8709>
<t8710>"First of all," said the trembling Mr. Cruncher, with an ashen pale and serious face, "let these poor souls be saved, I will never do this job again, never!</t8710><t8711>"</t8711>
<t8712>"Whatever that thing is you mentioned, Mr. Cruncher," said Miss Pross, "I am sure you will not do it again and please do not think that you need to explain to me what it is."</t8712><t8713>"</t8713>
<t8714>"No, madam," replied Jerry, "I will not tell you.</t8714> <t8715>Secondly, once these poor souls are freed, I will never interfere with Ms. Cruncher's work again!</t8715><t8716>"</t8716>
<t8717>"Whatever this matter is in your house," said Miss Pross, wiping the tears from her eyes and trying to pull herself together, "it would be best if Ms. Cruncher had complete control over it, of course.</t8717> <t8718>–Oh my poor ones!</t8718><t8719>"</t8719>
<t8720>Leaning forward anxiously as if giving a speech from a podium, "In fact, madam," continued Mr. Cruncher, "you personally remember what I said and tell Ms. Cruncher, explain to her how much my thoughts on praying have changed and how much I now wish she were praying."</t8720><t8721>"</t8721>
<t8722>"Yes, yes, yes! I hope he is praying now, dear Jerry," cried the ecstatic Miss Pross, "I hope all his prayers are answered.</t8722><t8723>"</t8723>
<t8724>Mr. Cruncher, in a very solemn, very slow manner, and even more as if he were giving a speech, continued, "God help us," he said, "whatever I have said or done, may it benefit these poor creatures!</t8724> <t8725>God help us, (if it will help them get out of this terrible situation) let us kneel and pray!</t8725> <t8726>God help us, madam!</t8726> <t8727>Please help us, God!" Mr. Cruncher had tried to end his words in a better way, but it had not worked.</t8727>
<t8728>Meanwhile, Madam Defarge, who was progressing steadily on her path, had approached the house.</t8728>
<t8729>"If we can return to our homeland one day," said Miss Pross, "you can be sure that I will tell Ms. Cruncher as much of your impressive words as I can remember and understand, and you can trust that I will testify that you were completely serious about this matter during this terrible time.</t8729> <t8730>Now let's think, please!</t8730> <t8731>Dear Mr. Cruncher, let's think, come on!</t8731><t8732>"</t8732>
<t8733>Madame Defarge, still advancing steadily, was now much closer to home.</t8733>
<t8734>"If you go ahead," said Miss Pross, "and prevent the carriage and horses from coming here, and wait for me somewhere, wouldn't that be better?</t8734><t8735>"</t8735>
<t8736>Mr. Cruncher thought that this was a very good idea.</t8736>
<t8737>"Where can you wait for me?" asked Miss Pross.</t8737>
<t8738>Mr. Cruncher was so bewildered that he couldn't think of any place other than Temple Bar.</t8738> <t8739>Oh no! Temple Bar was hundreds of miles away, and Madame Defarge had already gotten very close to the house.</t8739>
<t8740>"At the cathedral door," said Miss Pross.</t8740> <t8741>"Would we be taking a much longer route if you picked me up at the cathedral door between the two towers?</t8741><t8742>"</t8742>
<t8743>"No, ma'am," said Mr. Cruncher.</t8743>
<t8744>"Then like a proper man," said Miss Pross, "go straight to the relay station and change your horses."</t8744><t8745>"</t8745>
<t8746>Mr. Cruncher shook his head hesitantly, "I'm not sure about leaving you here alone.</t8746> <t8747>What if something happens to you?</t8747><t8748>"</t8748>
<t8749>"That is up to God now," said Miss Pross, "don't you worry.</t8749> <t8750>Pick me up at three o'clock or around three from the cathedral; it will definitely be much better than leaving from here.</t8750> <t8751>I am very sure of this.</t8751> <t8752>Let's go!</t8752> <t8753>God help you, Mr. Cruncher! Think not of me, but of those poor souls whose lives may depend on us!</t8753><t8754>"</t8754>
<t8755>These words and Miss Pross's pleading grip on his hands had convinced Mr. Cruncher.</t8755> <t8756>After nodding encouragingly a couple of times, he immediately went out to get ready and left Miss Pross alone, as she had suggested.</t8756>
<t8757>That they had taken such a precaution and implemented it immediately had greatly relieved Miss Pross.</t8757> <t8758>Changing her appearance so as not to be recognized on the streets was another source of relief.</t8758> <t8759>She looked at her watch; it was twenty past two.</t8759> <t8760>There was no time to lose; she had to get ready immediately.</t8760>
<t8761>Miss Pross, with the unease and fear brought on by being alone in deserted rooms and the feeling that someone was watching from behind every door, began to wash her red and swollen eyes with a bowl of cold water.</t8761> <t8762>She was so anxious and uneasy that she was disturbed by the momentary loss of vision when the water hit her face, constantly pausing to look around and make sure no one was watching her.</t8762> <t8763>During one of these pauses, she let out a scream, startled, because there was someone standing in the middle of the room.</t8763>
<t8764>The cup fell to the ground and broke, and the water flowed towards Madam Defarge's feet.</t8764> <t8765>These feet had traversed such merciless paths and had been stained with so much blood before meeting this water.</t8765>
<t8766>Madame Defarge looked at Miss Pross with a cold expression and asked, "Where is Evremonde's wife?"</t8766>
<t8767>Suddenly, it occurred to Miss Pross that all the doors in the rooms were open, which could make it seem like they had escaped.</t8767> <t8768>Miss Pross's first task was to close them.</t8768> <t8769>She closed all four doors inside the room.</t8769> <t8770>Then she stood in front of the door to the room where Lucie was staying.</t8770>
<t8771>Madame Defarge's dark eyes followed all this movement and, when it was over, fixed on Miss Pross.</t8771> <t8772>There was nothing about Miss Pross that could be called beautiful; the years had not tamed her wildness nor softened the harshness of her appearance; but she was a determined woman in her own way, and she fixed her eyes on Madame Defarge, scrutinizing her from head to toe.</t8772>
<t8773>"You must be the devil's wife," said Miss Pross, breathlessly.</t8773> <t8774>"But you cannot defeat me.</t8774> <t8775>I am an Englishwoman.</t8775><t8776>"</t8776>
<t8777>Madam Defarge looked disdainfully, but it had not escaped Miss Pross's notice that she actually saw her as an equal.</t8777> <t8778>The firm, hard, and sturdy woman in front of her was the same woman with strong hands that Mr. Lorry had seen years ago.</t8778> <t8779>Madam Defarge knew very well that Miss Pross was the loyal friend of the family, and Miss Pross knew very well that Madam Defarge was the stone-hearted enemy of the family.</t8779>
<t8780>Madam Defarge said, "While I go to the place where they put my chair and knitting," lightly waving her hand towards the deadly area, "I thought I would stop by and convey my best wishes to Lucie.</t8780> <t8781>I want to see her.</t8781><t8782>"</t8782>
<t8783>"I know how malicious you are," said Miss Pross, "but remember that you are facing me.</t8783><t8784>"</t8784>
<t8785>Both were speaking in their own language; neither understood the other; both were on alert, trying to deduce what the other was saying from their expressions and demeanor.</t8785>
<t8786>"At this point, there is no benefit for Lucie to hide from me," said Madam Defarge.</t8786> <t8787>"Good citizens know what this means.</t8787> <t8788>Let me see her.</t8788> <t8789>Go and tell her that I want to see her.</t8789> <t8790>Do you hear me?</t8790><t8791>"</t8791>
<t8792>"If your eyes were a crane," said Miss Pross, "I would be a four-poster English bed, and you still couldn't move me an inch from my place.</t8792> <t8793>It's not that easy, you foreign woman.</t8793> <t8794>You can't defeat me.</t8794><t8795>"</t8795>
<t8796>Although Madam Defarge did not understand much of what he said, she could sense that a barrier had been put up in front of her.</t8796>
<t8797>Madam Defarge, "What a fool, what a pig of a woman you are!" she said, frowning.</t8797> <t8798>"Do not answer me.</t8798> <t8799>I want to see Lucie.</t8799> <t8800>Either tell her that I want to see her or get out of my way so I can find her!"</t8800> <t8801>As she said this, she waved her right arm angrily.</t8801>
<t8802>"I never thought I would ever want to understand your ridiculous language, but right now, I would give everything I have except the clothes on my back to find out if you doubt what the truth is or any part of it.</t8802><t8803>"</t8803>
<t8804>For a moment, both of them looked at each other without blinking.</t8804> <t8805>Madam Defarge had been standing at the spot where Miss Pross first saw her until that moment, but now she had taken a step forward.</t8805>
<t8806>"I am British," said Miss Pross.</t8806> <t8807>"I can risk everything.</t8807> <t8808>My life is not valuable.</t8808> <t8809>The longer I keep you here, the better it will be for my little bird.</t8809> <t8810>If you dare to touch me, know that I will not leave a single hair on your dark head."</t8810><t8811>"</t8811>
<t8812>Miss Pross was shaking her head from side to side and glaring at Madam during all these rapid sentences, and each sentence was coming out of her mouth in a single breath.</t8812> <t8813>On the other hand, Miss Pross had never struck anyone in her life.</t8813>
<t8814>Her courage stemmed from her emotions, and suddenly tears streamed from her eyes.</t8814> <t8815>Madame Defarge could not understand this courage and saw the tears as a sign of weakness.</t8815> <t8816>"Ha ha ha!" she laughed, "you poor thing!</t8816> <t8817>What did you think of yourself!</t8817> <t8818>I'd better talk to the Doctor."</t8818> <t8819>Then she shouted loudly, "Citizen Doctor!</t8819> <t8820>The wife of Evremonde!</t8820> <t8821>The daughter of Evremonde!</t8821> <t8822>Whoever is there besides this miserable creature I am speaking to, answer Citizen Defarge!</t8822><t8823>"</t8823>
<t8824>Maybe it was the ensuing silence, maybe it was the revealing expression on Miss Pross's face, or perhaps an independent suspicion whispered to Madam Defarge that they had left.</t8824> <t8825>She quickly opened the three doors and looked inside.</t8825>
<t8826>"All these rooms are scattered, as if someone quickly tidied up around here, a lot of knick-knacks are strewn on the floor.</t8826> <t8827>There must be someone in the room behind you!</t8827> <t8828>Let me take a look.</t8828><t8829>"</t8829>
<t8830>"Never!" said Miss Pross, and Madam Defarge understood this reply as well as Miss Pross understood her own intention.</t8830>
<t8831>Madam Defarge said to herself, "If they are not in the room, they have gone, but they can be caught and brought back, of course."</t8831>
<t8832>Miss Pross said, "You won't know what to do unless you know whether they are in that room or not," she said to herself, "and if I don't give you the chance, you won't learn it; moreover, whether you learn it or not, I won't let you out of here.</t8832><t8833>"</t8833>
<t8834>"I have been on the streets since the first day, nothing has stopped me yet, I will tear you apart and still pass by that door," said Madam Defarge.</t8834>
<t8835>"We are alone with you at the top of this large house in a desolate courtyard, no one can hear us, may God give me strength so that I can keep you here longer, after all, every minute you spend here is worth the world for my little bird," said Miss Pross.</t8835>
<t8836>Madam Defarge rushed towards the door.</t8836> <t8837>Miss Pross, however, instinctively grabbed her tightly around the waist with both hands.</t8837> <t8838>Although Madam Defarge struggled and tried to hit, it was to no avail; Miss Pross, with the determination of love which is always much stronger than hatred, held her tightly, even lifting her from where they had fallen during the struggle.</t8838> <t8839>Madam Defarge was punching and scratching Miss Pross's face with both hands; but Miss Pross, with her head down, continued to hold her around the waist, clinging to her as if holding a drowning woman.</t8839>
<t8840>Soon, Madam Defarge's hands stopped struggling and reached for her wrapped waist.</t8840> <t8841>Miss Pross, in a muffled voice, said, "Under my arm," she said, "you can't take it out.</t8841> <t8842>Thank goodness, I'm stronger than you.</t8842> <t8843>I'll hold you like this until one of us faints or dies!</t8843><t8844>"</t8844>
<t8845>Madam Defarge's hands went to her bosom.</t8845> <t8846>Miss Pross looked up, and seeing what was happening, struck with her hand, and with the strike, there was a sudden flash of light and an explosion, leaving her alone there, her eyes dazzled by the smoke.</t8846>
<t8847>It all happened in an instant.</t8847> <t8848>The smoke dispersed, leaving behind a dreadful silence, and mingled with the air like the soul of the angry woman lying lifeless on the ground.</t8848>
<t8849>After the initial fear and horror she experienced, Miss Pross moved as far away as she could from the lifeless body and went downstairs to call for help in vain.</t8849> <t8850>Fortunately, she then thought about the consequences of her actions, came to her senses, and returned.</t8850> <t8851>Entering through that door again was terrifying, but she did it, and even went up to it to retrieve her bonnet and other belongings.</t8851> <t8852>She put these on by the stairs, closed and locked the door, and took the key.</t8852> <t8853>Then, after sitting on the steps to catch her breath and cry for a bit, she got up and hurried away.</t8853>
<t8854>Luckily, there was a veil over her hat, otherwise, it would have been impossible for her to walk through those streets without being stopped.</t8854> <t8855>Luckily, there was such a natural oddity in her appearance that her ugliness did not attract attention as it did in other women.</t8855> <t8856>Both were to her advantage, because there were deep scratch marks on her face, her hair was disheveled, and her outfit (hastily adjusted with trembling hands) looked as if it had been tugged at hundreds of times.</t8856>
<t8857>While crossing the bridge, he threw the key to the door into the river.</t8857> <t8858>Arriving at the cathedral a few minutes before his companion and waiting there, his mind was occupied with questions like, what if the key got caught in a net, what if they figured out what it was, what if they opened the door and saw what was inside, what if he was stopped at the exit and sent to prison and tried for murder!</t8858> <t8859>While Miss Pross was immersed in all these anxious thoughts, her companion appeared and took her along to continue on their way.</t8859>
<t8860>"Is there any noise in the streets?" asked Miss Pross.</t8860>
<t8861>"The usual sounds, that's all," said Mr. Cruncher; he seemed surprised both by the woman's condition and her question.</t8861>
<t8862>"I can't hear you," said Miss Pross.</t8862> <t8863>"What did you say?</t8863><t8864>"</t8864>
<t8865>Mr. Cruncher repeated his words in vain; Miss Pross could not hear him.</t8865> <t8866>"Then I'll nod my head," thought Mr. Cruncher, in amazement, "she'll see that in any case."</t8866> <t8867>And she did.</t8867>
<t8868>Miss Pross asked again shortly after, "Is there any noise in the streets right now?"</t8868>
<t8869>Mr. Cruncher nodded his head forward again.</t8869>
<t8870>"I can't hear.</t8870><t8871>"</t8871>
<t8872>"Did she go deaf in an hour?" said Mr. Cruncher, confused and disturbed; "what happened to this woman?"</t8872><t8873>"</t8873>
<t8874>"It was as if," said Miss Pross, "there was a flash of light and an explosion, and that explosion was the last thing I heard.</t8874><t8875>"</t8875>
<t8876>"How strange he has become!" said Mr. Cruncher, now thoroughly disturbed.</t8876> <t8877>"Did he drink something to boost his courage?</t8877> <t8878>Listen!</t8878> <t8879>A lot of death carts are passing by!</t8879> <t8880>Do you hear, madam?</t8880><t8881>"</t8881>
<t8882>Seeing that Mr. Cruncher was saying something to her, Miss Pross said, "I can't hear anything. Oh my friend, first there was a great explosion, then a great silence covered everything, and this silence never ends, it never changes, it feels like it will never end until the end of my life."</t8882><t8883>"</t8883>
<t8884>"If he can't hear the sound of these death carts coming to the end of the road," said Mr. Cruncher, looking over his shoulder, "he will never hear anything again in his life.</t8884><t8885>"</t8885>
<t8886>Indeed, Miss Pross never heard it again.</t8886>
<t8887>XV</t8887>
<t8888>The Footsteps Fall Silent Forever</t8888>
<t8889>The death carts proceed along the streets of Paris with creaks and rumbles.</t8889> <t8890>Six carts carry the wines of the day to the guillotine.</t8890> <t8891>All those unimaginable greedy, all-consuming monsters seem to have gathered in a single body, transformed into the guillotine.</t8891> <t8892>In the rich soil and diverse climate of France, no bush, leaf, root, sprout, or peppercorn matures more distinctly than the conditions that create this fear.</t8892> <t8893>If you were to crush humanity similarly with hammers, it would return to its former troubled state.</t8893> <t8894>If you sow the same seeds of greed and oppression, it is clear that you will achieve the same result.</t8894>
<t8895>Six cars are moving along the streets.</t8895> <t8896>If the powerful magician, namely "time," were to transform them into the past, they would appear as the chariots of absolute rulers, the materials of feudal nobles, the dressing rooms of radiant and glamorous women, churches that are more nests of thieves than houses of God, and the huts of millions of starving peasants!</t8896> <t8897>But no; the mighty magician who enforces the order set by the Creator never turns the things he transforms back to their original state.</t8897> <t8898>In the wise tales of One Thousand and One Nights, he says to the enchanted ones, "If God has made you this way,"</t8898> <t8899>"then remain so! But if you have come to this state through a temporary spell, then return to your former state!" The cars, in the same way, are moving forward desperately.</t8899>
<t8900>As the gloomy wheels of six carts turn, a crooked furrow forms among the crowd in the streets.</t8900> <t8901>Faces turn one way, then the other, and the plow moves forward smoothly.</t8901> <t8902>The people living in the nearby houses are so accustomed to this sight that many windows are empty; some just glance at the people inside the carts without pausing their work.</t8902> <t8903>In some houses, there are guests who come just to watch this; then the host, with the indifference of an exhibition organizer or an official, points to the carts one by one and tells them who was inside yesterday and the day before.</t8903>
<t8904>Some of the passengers in the cars are watching the surroundings and everything happening on their final journey with indifferent eyes, while others are observing with a lethargic interest.</t8904> <t8905>Some have their heads bowed, immersed in silent despair; others, aware of the significance of their gaze, are looking at the crowd with attitudes reminiscent of what they have seen in theaters and paintings.</t8905> <t8906>A few have closed their eyes, thinking or trying to gather their scattered thoughts.</t8906> <t8907>Only one, a poor creature driven mad, is so overwhelmed and intoxicated by fear that they are trying to sing and dance.</t8907> <t8908>Among all these people, not a single one is begging for mercy from others with their looks or movements.</t8908>
<t8909>There are a number of mounted guards right next to the cars, and people frequently turn their faces to them and ask something.</t8909> <t8910>It seems that the question asked is the same, as people always rush to the third car afterward.</t8910> <t8911>The mounted guards next to that car constantly point to a man inside with their swords.</t8911> <t8912>Everyone is curious about who he is; he, however, stands at the back of the car, head bowed, talking to a poor girl who is sitting on the side of the car and holding his hand.</t8912> <t8913>He doesn't care about being watched or the commotion he has caused and continues to talk to the girl.</t8913> <t8914>Along the long St Honore Street, people are shouting against him.</t8914> <t8915>He, however, does nothing but silently smile while shaking his head to push back the hair that falls on his face.</t8915> <t8916>Since his arms are tied, he cannot touch his face.</t8916>
<t8917>The prison rat Spy is standing on the steps of a church, waiting for the cars to arrive.</t8917> <t8918>He looks at the first car, it's not there.</t8918> <t8919>He looks at the second car, it's not there.</t8919> <t8920>Just as he is thinking to himself, "Did he sacrifice me?" he sees the third car and feels relieved.</t8920>
<t8921>"Which one is Evremonde?" asks the man behind him.</t8921>
<t8922>"That one.</t8922> <t8923>The one standing at the back.</t8923><t8924>"</t8924>
<t8925>"The man holding the girl's hand?"</t8925><t8926>"</t8926>
<t8927>"Yes.</t8927><t8928>"</t8928>
<t8929>Adam, "Die Evremonde! All aristocrats to the guillotine!</t8929> <t8930>Die already, Evremonde!"</t8930>
<t8931>"Shh, shh!" says the Spy immediately, timidly.</t8931>
<t8932>"Why shouldn't we say it, citizen?</t8932><t8933>"</t8933>
<t8934>"He will pay for what he has done, he has five minutes.</t8934> <t8935>Let's leave him alone now.</t8935><t8936>"</t8936>
<t8937>But the man keeps shouting, "Die Evremonde!" and Evremonde turns his face towards him for a moment.</t8937> <t8938>Then he sees the Spy, looks at him carefully, and continues on his way.</t8938>
<t8939>The clocks show three, and the furrow moving through the crowd meanders and ends at the execution site.</t8939> <t8940>People scattered to the sides approach the last plow in small groups, as they all head towards the Guillotine.</t8940> <t8941>Right in front of it, there are many women sitting on chairs, knitting as if they have come to the park for amusement.</t8941> <t8942>Vengeance, standing up on one of the front chairs, is looking around for her friend.</t8942>
<t8943>"Therese!" screams Revenge in its shrillest voice.</t8943> <t8944>"Has anyone seen her?"</t8944> <t8945>Therese Defarge!"</t8945>
<t8946>"She had never missed one before," says a woman knitting in the group.</t8946>
<t8947>"No; now he won't miss it either," shouts İntikam, grumpily.</t8947> <t8948>"Therese!"</t8948>
<t8949>"Louder," advises the woman.</t8949>
<t8950>Yeah! Scream Revenge louder, much louder, but he still can barely hear you.</t8950> <t8951>Even if you scream louder, Revenge, and even add an oath at the end, he won't come anymore.</t8951> <t8952>If you want, send other women to search for that madam who is writhing in pain somewhere; even if these women have committed terrible acts in the past, how hard will they try to find her?</t8952>
<t8953>"What luck!" shouts Revenge, stomping her foot hard on the chair, "the cars have arrived!</t8953> <t8954>Evremonde's shipment is imminent, and he's nowhere to be found!</t8954> <t8955>I have his knitting in my hand, his chair is ready.</t8955> <t8956>I'm going to cry out of anger and disappointment now!</t8956><t8957>"</t8957>
<t8958>As revenge descends from the top of the chair for this purpose, the cars also begin to unload their cargo.</t8958> <t8959>The deputies of Saint Guillotine are waiting ready in their robes.</t8959> <t8960>Thud! – A head flies off and is shown to the crowd; the women knitting, who just a minute ago didn't deign to look at it while it was thinking and speaking, are now counting.</t8960> <t8961>One.</t8961>
<t8962>The second car also unloads its cargo and leaves; then the third one comes.</t8962> <t8963>Click! The women knitting continue to count without pausing or hesitating in their work.</t8963> <t8964>Two.</t8964>
<t8965>So-called Evremonde descends, followed by the seamstress girl.</t8965> <t8966>As promised, he has never let go of the girl's hand, not even while descending, keeping his patient hand steady.</t8966> <t8967>He gently presses the girl's back against the ever-working cutting mechanism, and she looks at him and thanks Evremonde.</t8967>
<t8968>"If it weren't for you, dear stranger, I could neither be this calm –for I am a wretched person by nature and my heart is very weak– nor could I share these thoughts with the person condemned to death and feel the hope and comfort that I feel here today.</t8968> <t8969>Surely, God sent you to me.</t8969><t8970>"</t8970>
<t8971>"Or you to me," says Sydney Carton.</t8971> <t8972>"Keep your eyes on me, dear child, and don't worry about anything else.</t8972><t8973>"</t8973>
<t8974>"When I'm holding your hand, nothing else matters to me.</t8974> <t8975>If they finish this quickly when I let go of your hands, I won't care either.</t8975><t8976>"</t8976>
<t8977>"It will be over quickly.</t8977> <t8978>Don't be afraid!"</t8978>
<t8979>Even though they stand among a rapidly dwindling heap of victims, they speak as if they are alone.</t8979> <t8980>These two children of Mother Earth, although very different from each other under different circumstances, have come together on this dark path, eye to eye, hand in hand, heart to heart, to support each other and rest in their mother's embrace.</t8980>
<t8981>"Brave and honorable friend, may I ask you one last question?</t8981> <t8982>I am very ignorant, and this bothers me a bit.</t8982><t8983>"</t8983>
<t8984>"Tell me.</t8984><t8985>"</t8985>
<t8986>"I have a cousin whom I love very much, my only relative, and like me, he is also an orphan.</t8986> <t8987>He is five years younger than me and lives on a farm in the south.</t8987> <t8988>Poverty separated us, and he has no idea what has happened to me –I can't write anyway– even if I could write, how could I tell him this!</t8988> <t8989>Maybe it's better this way.</t8989><t8990>"</t8990>
<t8991>"Yes, yes; this way is better.</t8991><t8992>"</t8992>
<t8993>"I was thinking while coming on the road and I am still thinking while looking at your kind and strong face that gives me strength, if the Republic truly helps the poor and reduces their hunger and suffering, my cousin may live long, even grow old."</t8993><t8994>"</t8994>
<t8995>"What does it matter, my dear brother?</t8995><t8996>"</t8996>
<t8997>"I wonder," the girl's gentle, non-pleading eyes filled with tears and her lips parted further and began to tremble, "while I wait for him where I'm going – and I'm sure we will be protected with mercy there – will this time feel long to me?</t8997><t8998>"</t8998>
<t8999>"He won't come, my dear; there is no Time there, nor is there any trouble.</t8999><t9000>"</t9000>
<t9001>"How you put my mind at ease!</t9001> <t9002>I am very ignorant.</t9002> <t9003>Can I kiss you now?</t9003> <t9004>Has the time come?</t9004><t9005>"</t9005>
<t9006>"Yes.</t9006><t9007>"</t9007>
<t9008>They kiss each other on the lips and bless each other with a solemn air.</t9008> <t9009>When he lets go of the girl's hand, it no longer trembles.</t9009> <t9010>A sweet, radiant determination has enveloped his patient face.</t9010> <t9011>The next person, the one who will go immediately in front, is him; the women knitting are counting.</t9011> <t9012>Twenty-two.</t9012>
<t9013>"I am the Resurrection and the Life," said God.</t9013> <t9014>Whoever believes in me,.</t9014> <t9015>even if they die, will live, and whoever lives and believes in me will never die.</t9015><t9016>"</t9016>
<t9017>Murmurs are rising, everyone's face is turning that way, there's such a jostling at the edge of the crowd that the whole mass swells forward like a huge wave and then disappears.</t9017> <t9018>Twenty-three.</t9018>
<t9019>That night, everyone in the city talked about how they had never seen a face as peaceful as his.</t9019> <t9020>Many people added that he looked so transcendent and sublime.</t9020>
<t9021>One of the most notable victims of the same knife – a woman – had asked for permission to write down her thoughts shortly before her execution, at the foot of the same gallows.</t9021> <t9022>If Carton were also given the opportunity to express himself, he would have uttered these sublime words:</t9022>
<t9023>"I see that Barsad, Cly, Defarge, Vengeance, the Jury, the Judge, and the new tyrants rising from the destruction of the old order will perish by this treacherous instrument before its current use ends.</t9023> <t9024>I see a beautiful city and brilliant people emerging from this abyss, and for many years, in their struggle to remain truly free, in their victories and defeats, I see the evil of the past, which slowly pays its penalty and fades away, in these times.</t9024>
<t9025>The lives for which I gave my life, in that England I will never see again,</t9025> <t9026>I see them peaceful, useful, prosperous, and happy.</t9026> <t9027>I see her with a child in her arms, bearing my name.</t9027> <t9028>I see his father aged and worn; on the other hand, improved and serving people in his clinic, and peaceful.</t9028> <t9029>I see the kind-hearted old man, their former friend who enriched their lives for ten years and peacefully received his reward.</t9029>
<t9030>I see that I will have a sacred place in the hearts of their grandchildren and all subsequent generations.</t9030> <t9031>I see her, as an old woman, crying on this day every year.</t9031> <t9032>I see her and her husband lying side by side in their final resting place in this mortal world, their lives having ended, and I know that both have reserved the most honorable and sacred place for me in their hearts, just as they have for each other.</t9032>
<t9033>I see the child, who carries my name and rests on his chest, walking the path I once walked and making a living.</t9033> <t9034>I see that he is very successful in his work, and my name shines with his light.</t9034> <t9035>I see the stains I placed on my name being cleaned.</t9035> <t9036>I see this man, the foremost of conscientious judges and honorable men, bringing his son, who also carries my name and has a familiar brow and golden hair, here – of course, by then, there will be no trace of the current ugly state here – and I hear him telling my story to his son in a compassionate and hesitant voice.</t9036>
<t9037>This is the best, the most correct thing I have ever done, and the end of this road is a sleep as beautiful, as wonderful as I have never known before.</t9037><t9038>"</t9038>
