<t0>Part One: REVIVAL</t0>
<t1>1.</t1> <t2>In those days</t2>
<t3>It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way – in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.</t3>
<t4>There was a King with a jutting chin and a plain Queen on the throne of England; there was a King with a jutting chin and a beautiful Queen on the throne of France*.</t4> <t5>In both countries, to those who monopolized the nation's treasures of bread and fish, it was as clear as daylight that everything had been ordained for eternity.</t5>
<t6>It was the year 1775.</t6> <t7>Prophecies and revelations became fashionable in England at that time, just as they are now.</t7> <t8>That year, the prophetess Southcott had just turned the blessed age of twenty-five, but even before that, a humble soldier with the ability to predict in the Guards had foretold her extraordinary advent by declaring that fate had decreed London and Westminster must be buried*.</t8> <t9>Even the ghost of Cock Lane*, after knocking out its messages, had only been at rest for about twelve years when, at that time, just a year before, many other spirits (not necessarily of supernatural origin) began knocking out messages again.</t9> <t10>These were all messages about the recent mundane events happening to the King and the people of England, emanating from a congress of English subjects in America*.</t10> <t11>Strangely enough, this turned out to be more important to humanity than all the messages previously received through any goblin in Cock Lane.</t11>
<t12>Generally not favoring the mystical matters as much as her sister wielding the shield and trident*, France kept printing paper money to spend while plunging into the abyss ever faster.</t12> <t13>Moreover, under the guidance of Christian shepherds, France entertained itself with humanitarian achievements such as sentencing a young man to have both hands cut off, his tongue clamped and pulled out, and his body burned alive, because he refused to kneel in the rain to show respect to a filthy procession of monks passing within forty or fifty meters of his sight*.</t13> <t14>It is very likely that when the wretched man received his death sentence, many tall trees, originating from the forests of France and Norway, had already been marked by the Woodman of Fate to be felled and sawed into planks, to craft the mobile guillotine with its blade and sack, a dreadful device in history.</t14> <t15>It is very likely that in the makeshift huts of the peasants on the barren lands near Paris, even from that day, there were crude carts sheltered from the sun and rain, muddied by the countryside, serving as perches for chickens and rooting places for pigs, carts that the Farmer of Death had reserved as vehicles to transport prisoners to the Revolutionary scaffold.</t15> <t16>The Woodman and the Farmer, though working ceaselessly, did so very quietly; no one heard a sound as they stealthily moved around - on the contrary, merely causing someone to suspect that they were aware of this was enough to be accused of impiety and rebellion.</t16>
<t17>In England, there were almost no protective laws that justified such national pride.</t17> <t18>Armed robberies and highway robberies occurred nightly right in the capital; families were publicly warned not to leave the city without moving all their belongings to the warehouses of merchants for safety; the highwayman in the dark was a city merchant in the light, and when identified and questioned by a colleague whom he had robbed in the role of a Big Brother, he brazenly shot the other in the head and rode away; the mail coach was ambushed by seven robbers, the escort shot dead three, then "due to an ammunition mishap," the escort himself was shot dead by the remaining four, after which the mail coach was peacefully robbed; the Lord Mayor of London, a venerable ruler, was also forced to stand still and hand over his belongings at Turnham Green as a thief robbed this dignitary right in front of all his attendants; the prisoners in London jail fought with the guards and the supreme law wielded blunderbusses, firing volleys of lead and iron balls into the chaos; thieves snipped off diamond-encrusted crosses worn around the necks of noble lords and ladies at court festivities; a group of royal guards stormed into the St. Giles area searching for contraband, and so the populace shot at the soldiers, the soldiers shot at the populace, and no one found this unusual.</t18> <t19>In that context, the type of person more useless than useful and busy, the executioner was continually ordered to act; sometimes hanging long rows of various criminals; sometimes hanging on a Saturday a thief who had been caught on Tuesday; sometimes burning a dozen people alive right in front of Newgate prison; and sometimes burning a pile of pamphlets right in front of Westminster Hall; today taking the life of a brutal murderer, and tomorrow taking the life of a wretched petty thief who had stolen six pence from a farmer's son.</t19>
<t20>All those things, and a thousand similar incidents, happened continuously in that memorable distant year of 1775.</t20> <t21>Amidst those events, while the Woodman and the Farmer worked silently, the two square-jawed men and the two with one plain and one beautiful face still stomped quite busily, hands raised high with the sacred privileges of kings.</t21> <t22>Thus, these great figures along with countless humble people - whose stories are recorded in books - would be led by the year 1775 down the paths of fate.</t22>
<t23>2.</t23> <t24>The Mail Car</t24>
<t25>On a late Friday night in November, the Dover road stretched out before the first character involved in this story.</t25> <t26>The Dover road stretched ahead, the Dover mail coach laboriously making its way up Shooter's Hill.</t26> <t27>That person similarly trudged up the slope in the mud beside the coach, as did the remaining passengers; not because they enjoyed the exercise under such circumstances, but because the hill, the harness, the mire, and the mail parcels had made the coach so heavy that the horses had to stop three times, with one additional attempt to drag the coach across the road in a rebellious effort to turn back to Blackheath.</t27> <t28>However, with the combined efforts of the reins and the whip, the coachman and the guard, adhering strictly to martial law, thwarted the intention that might have supported the argument that some animals are endowed with reason; thus, the rebellious ones were subdued and returned to their duty.</t28>
<t29>Heads bowed low, tails swishing, four horses trudged through the thick mud, inching forward; every so often they staggered as if their joints were about to fall apart.</t29> <t30>Each time the driver cautiously uttered a "Whoa! Easy, easy!" and pulled the reins to let them rest, the lead horse on his side would shake its head violently, scattering everything clinging to it - as if it were vehemently declaring that the mail coach would never make it to the top of the hill.</t30> <t31>Every time the lead horse caused a commotion, the traveler would startle, somewhat terrified, just like all other faint-hearted individuals.</t31>
<t32>The mist, heavy with moisture, filled every hollow and wandered sadly to the hilltop like a ghost searching for a resting place but unable to find one.</t32> <t33>The wet, cold mist slowly swirled and rose, clearly showing each layer overlapping and covering one another like waves on a stormy sea.</t33> <t34>The mist was so thick that what could be seen in the light of the lamp attached to the vehicle was just layers of that murkiness with a few yards of road ahead; the steaming breath of the weary horses blended into the mist as if this entire gloomy sky was exhaled by them.</t34>
<t35>Besides this character, the other two passengers were also trudging up the hill next to the mail coach.</t35> <t36>All three were wearing cloaks that covered their cheeks, hoods that covered their ears, and boots that reached above their knees.</t36> <t37>From the outside, no one could tell what the other two looked like; each person concealed themselves under layers of coverings that hid both their thoughts and appearances from their companions.</t37> <t38>At that time, travelers were very wary of forming sudden friendships because anyone on the road could potentially be a robber or an accomplice of robbers.</t38> <t39>With the second possibility, when every post station and tavern could have someone on Big Brother's payroll, from the landlord to the lowest stable boy, encountering an accomplice of robbers was the most likely occurrence.</t39> <t40>The escort of the Dover mail coach thought this to himself on that Friday night in November 1775 as the coach laboriously climbed Shooter's Hill, while he stood in the guard compartment at the back of the coach, stamping his feet and never taking his eyes or hands off the weapon chest, inside of which lay a loaded blunderbuss on top of six or eight muskets, with a short sword at the bottom.</t40>
<t41>This Dover mail coach, as usual, had an atmosphere of amiability in the manner of the escort suspecting the passengers, the passengers suspecting the escort and each other, everyone suspecting everyone else, while the driver only trusted the horses; and with these animals, he could place his hand on both volumes of the Holy Bible and swear with a clear conscience that they were not suited for this journey.</t41>
<t42>− Oh ho! - The driver exclaimed. - Keep going! Just pull one more time and you'll reach the top of the hill, and then I don't care what happens to you, because getting you there has already been too much trouble for me!...</t42> <t43>Joe! − Yes! - The escort replied.</t43>
<t44>− What time do you think it is now, Joe? −</t44> <t45>It's definitely eleven ten.</t45>
<t46>− Oh my! - The driver exclaimed angrily. - And we haven't even reached the top of Shooter Hill yet! Shush! Ha! Move on, you lot!</t46> <t47>With a decisive whip, the leading horse that had been protesting reluctantly surged forward, followed closely by the other three.</t47>
<t48>Once again, the Dover mail coach creaked and inched forward, with the passengers' boots trudging through the mud beside it.</t48> <t49>They had to stop when the coach stopped, and always had to stand close together beside the coach.</t49> <t50>If any one of the three dared to suggest moving a bit ahead into the fog and darkness, they would likely be suspected of being a robber and shot immediately.</t50>
<t51>The final jolt propelled the carriage to the top of the hill.</t51> <t52>The four horses stopped and panted again, the escort jumped down to attach the brake to the rear wheels of the carriage in preparation for the descent, and then opened the door for the passengers to board.</t52>
<t53>− Shh! Joe! - From the coachman's seat, the driver looked down, calling out in a warning tone.</t53>
<t54>− What's the matter, Tom? Both of them listened carefully.</t54>
<t55>− It seems like a horse is galloping towards us, Joe.</t55>
<t56>− Full gallop is right, Tom, - the escort replied, letting go of the car door and swiftly climbing up to his seat at the back.</t56> <t57>- Gentlemen! In the name of the king, attention everyone! He hastily called out, cocking his blunderbuss and standing ready.</t57>
<t58>The passenger, the character of the story, stepped onto the carriage door; the two other passengers standing close behind also intended to follow.</t58>
<t59>He was still standing on the step, half inside and half outside, so the other two had to wait on the ground.</t59> <t60>All three kept looking from the driver to the escort, then from the escort to the driver, standing still and listening.</t60> <t61>The driver looked back, the escort also looked back, even the leading horse pricked its ears and looked back without objection.</t61>
<t62>The silence after the mail coach had stopped its writhing and creaking, combined with the stillness of the night, made the atmosphere as quiet as a sheet.</t62> <t63>The panting of the horses made the coach tremble as if it too were agitated.</t63> <t64>The hearts of the three passengers were probably beating so hard that they could be heard; or rather, the state of sudden stillness revealed clearly the people who were gasping, holding their breath, and whose hearts were pounding in anticipation.</t64>
<t65>The sound of galloping horse hooves up the hill grew faster and more powerful.</t65>
<t66>− Oh ho! - The escort shouted with all his might. - Who's there? Stop! I'll shoot!</t66> <t67>The hoofbeats suddenly halted, and amidst the splashing mud and staggering steps, a voice rang out in the fog: −</t67> <t68>Is that the Dover mail coach? −</t68> <t69>What does it matter if it is or isn't? - The escort retorted. - Who are you? −</t69> <t70>Is it the Dover mail coach? − Why do you want to know? − I need to find a passenger, if it is.</t70>
<t71>− Which guest? − Mr. Jarvis Lorry.</t71>
<t72>The character in our book immediately confirmed that it was their name.</t72>
<t73>The escort, the coachman, and the two other passengers looked at him with suspicion.</t73>
<t74>− Stand still, - the escort said to the person in the mist, - if I slip, you will be ruined beyond repair.</t74> <t75>Answer immediately, Mr. Lorry.</t75>
<t76>− What's the matter? - The passenger spoke up, then hesitated a bit before continuing.</t76> <t77>- Who needs to find me? Is it Jerry? ("I don't like Jerry's tone, if it's really him," the escort muttered to himself.</t77> <t78>"That unbearably hoarse voice, Jerry.") −</t78> <t79>Yes, Mr. Lorry.</t79>
<t80>− What's the matter? −</t80> <t81>There are messages from T. and the Association for you.</t81>
<t82>− I know this contact, - Lorry said to the escort as he stepped down to the street.</t82> <t83>The other two passengers stood behind him, helping him down hastily rather than politely, then they immediately got into the carriage, slammed the door, and pulled the window shut. - Let this person approach; it's alright.</t83>
<t84>− Hope it's nothing, but whether it is or isn't, I can't be sure, - the escort muttered to himself.</t84> <t85>- Hello! − Ah! Hello! - Jerry spoke up, his voice even raspier than before.</t85>
<t86>− Ride the horse slowly!</t86> <t87>Do you hear me clearly?</t87> <t88>If the saddle has a gun holster, don't let me see your hand reaching for it.</t88> <t89>Because I'm the kind of ruthless person who easily makes mistakes, and one mistake means one bullet.</t89> <t90>Now show your face so I can see.</t90>
<t91>The shape of a horse and a rider slowly emerged through the swirling mist and approached the mail coach, coming to the guest.</t91> <t92>The person on the horse leaned down, glanced at the escorting gunman, and handed the guest a small folded piece of paper.</t92> <t93>His horse was snorting, and both man and beast were covered in mud, from the horse's hooves to the hat on his head.</t93>
<t94>− Escort! - The passenger called out with a confident, calm voice.</t94>
<t95>Alert, his right hand gripping the gun's handle, his left hand raising the barrel, eyes not leaving the person on horseback, the mail coach guard replied curtly: −</t95> <t96>Yes! − There's nothing to be afraid of.</t96> <t97>I am a man of Tellson's Bank.</t97>
<t98>You probably know Tellson's Bank in London.</t98> <t99>I'm about to go on business in Paris. Take this crown and have a drink.</t99> <t100>Can I read a bit? −</t100> <t101>As long as it's quick, sir.</t101>
<t102>Lorry opened the paper and looked at it under the light of the nearby mail coach lamp; at first, he read silently, then aloud: − “Wait for the lady in Dover.” Very short, you see.</t102> <t103>Hey, Jerry, relay my response to them as “Recalled to Life.” −</t103> <t104>What kind of weird response is that, so mysterious,* - on horseback, Jerry exclaimed, his voice raspier than ever.</t104>
<t105>− Just reply like that and they will know that I have understood this message as clearly as if I had written it myself.</t105> <t106>Safe travels! Goodbye!</t106> <t107>Having said that, the guest opened the car door and stepped in; this time without any assistance from his companions, the other two in the car quickly hid their watches and wallets in their boots, and were now pretending to sleep.</t107> <t108>Their intention was clearly to avoid any unnecessary trouble.</t108>
<t109>The mail coach creaked as it rolled along, the fog swirling and thickening as the coach began its descent.</t109> <t110>The escort stowed his blunderbuss in the weapon chest, and after checking the weapons inside and the few additional pistols strapped to his belt, he examined a smaller chest under the seat, which contained some blacksmith tools, a few torches, and a tinderbox.</t110> <t111>He had to be fully equipped, in case the coach lamps were blown out - a not uncommon occurrence - so he could simply crawl inside the coach, keep the flint and tinder away from the straw*, and relight the lamps safely and easily within five minutes (if he was lucky).</t111>
<t112>− Tom! - The escort whispered softly through the roof of the car.</t112>
<t113>− Hey, Joe.</t113>
<t114>− Did you hear that message? − Yes, Joe.</t114>
<t115>− Do you understand anything, Tom? −</t115> <t116>Not a thing, Joe.</t116>
<t117>− What a coincidence, - the escort pondered, - I don't understand anything either.</t117>
<t118>Left alone in the dark, Jerry dismounted for a moment, not only to let the horse rest but also to wipe the mud off his face and shake the water off his wide-brimmed hat, which could probably hold more than a liter.</t118> <t119>Draping the reins over his mud-stained arm, he stood until he could no longer hear the mail coach and the night returned to its usual stillness, then turned around and led the horse down the hill.</t119>
<t120>− Hey old woman, having galloped all the way from Temple Bar gate to here, I don't trust your legs anymore until you get down to the ground, - the hoarse-voiced messenger glanced at the horse.</t120> <t121>- “Recalled to life.”</t121> <t122>What the hell kind of message is that, so mysterious.</t122> <t123>Bad luck for you, Jerry! I'm sure of it!</t123> <t124>If everyone who dies gets recalled to life, it will only be a curse for you, Jerry!</t124>
<t125>3.</t125> <t126>Spirits in the Night</t126>
<t127>It's really strange to think about it, each person harbors a deep secret and is incomprehensible to one another.</t127> <t128>Every time I go to a big city at night, I sincerely ponder that each house in those dark streets hides its own secret; each room in every house hides its own secret; each heart beating in the hundreds of thousands of chests in that city, in some dreams, is also a secret to the nearest heart!</t128> <t129>This relates to something very frightening, perhaps even Death itself.</t129> <t130>We can no longer turn the precious pages of life's book, with the vain hope of having time to read it fully.</t130> <t131>We cannot see through the unfathomable depths of life's stream, when the light suddenly flashes to show us the buried treasures and hidden things, fate has decreed that the book will abruptly close, forever and ever, when we have only read one page, fate has decreed that the water will freeze in eternal frost, while the light shimmers on the ice and we remain oblivious on the shore.</t131> <t132>Our friends die, our neighbors die, our lovers, the beloved of our hearts die; the secret always buried deep within each individual will be sealed forever, never to be revealed, and we will also carry our own secrets to the grave.</t132> <t133>In every cemetery of this city that I have passed through, is it not true that those lying beneath the ground are more mysterious and incomprehensible to me than the deep hearts of the bustling residents here, or is it that I am also exceedingly mysterious to them?</t133> <t134>In this regard, the messenger on horseback is of course no different from anyone else, he too has secrets just like the King, the Prime Minister, or the richest Merchant in London.</t134> <t135>The three passengers huddled within the narrow confines of the lumbering mail coach are the same; each person is a mystery to the others, completely closed off as if each were sitting in their own carriage, whether drawn by six or sixty horses, so close yet so far apart.</t135>
<t136>The messenger rode his horse at a leisurely trot back, occasionally stopping at a tavern to take a sip but always maintaining his clarity, pulling up the brim of his hat, not obscuring his view.</t136> <t137>He had eyes that matched the hat perfectly, pitch-black eyes with no clear shape or color and set too close together - as if both were afraid of revealing something if they were too far apart.</t137> <t138>Those eyes gleamed with a sinister look beneath the old tricorn hat that resembled a three-cornered spittoon, above the scarf that covered his chin and throat, hanging down to his knees.</t138> <t139>Each time he stopped his horse to drink, he would only use his left hand to pull down the scarf while his right hand lifted the cup to his lips; after a sip, he would pull it back up.</t139>
<t140>− No, no way, Jerry, - the messenger kept muttering to himself about that matter on horseback.</t140> <t141>- Bad luck for you, Jerry! You, an honest worker, this matter doesn't suit your style at all! Resurrection...!</t141> <t142>If he isn't drunk, then strike me down! That message made him so bewildered that he had to take off his hat and scratch his head multiple times.</t142> <t143>Except for the already bald top, his hair was black, stiff, bristling all over his head, and grew long enough to almost touch his broad nose.</t143> <t144>Like a blacksmith's creation, it bristled like steel spikes embedded in a wall, more than a head of hair, even the best sheep jumpers wouldn't dare leap over it, considering it the most dangerous obstacle in the world.</t144>
<t145>As he galloped with the message to deliver it to the night watchman at the guard post in front of Tellson's Bank near the Temple Bar gate, the shadows of the night seemed to emerge from that very message; even his horse might have seen shapes manifesting from the depths of its own fears.</t145> <t146>There must have been many ghosts, as the horse kept jumping away from the dark shadows on the road.</t146>
<t147>At the same time, the mail truck was creaking, jolting, bouncing, and bumping along the endless road with three mysterious people inside.</t147> <t148>For them as well, the spirits of the night appeared in various forms in their sleepy eyes and in their wandering thoughts.</t148>
<t149>The Tellson Bank is experiencing a massive withdrawal right on this mail coach trip.</t149> <t150>While the bank employee dozed off, an arm slipped through the leather strap to keep him from bumping into the person next to him and pushing him into the corner every time the coach jolted; through his half-closed eyes, the small windows and the dim light of the mail coach, along with the bulky figure of the passenger opposite, transformed into the very bank itself during a moment of unexpected crisis.</t150> <t151>The clatter of the harness turned into the clinking of coins, and in five minutes, more banknotes were converted into cash than the total amount Tellson, with all its branches at home and abroad, had ever paid out in three times as long.</t151> <t152>Then the vaults beneath Tellson Bank, filled with treasures and secrets that this passenger knew (and knew quite well), suddenly opened wide before him; he then took the large keys and a dim candle, walked through the vaults, and found everything still safe, solid, secure, and quiet as it had been during the last inspection.</t152>
<t153>But even though the bank was always on his mind, even though he still knew he was sitting in the mail truck (vaguely aware as if still recognizing the pain while groggy from anesthesia), there was another stream of thoughts continuously running through, all night long.</t153> <t154>He was on his way to exhume a person.</t154>
<t155>At this moment, the shadows of the night did not reveal which was the true face of the one buried among the myriad faces appearing before him; but they were all faces of a person around forty-five years old, differing mainly in the emotions expressed, and in the terrifying appearance of their wretchedness.</t155> <t156>Pride, contempt, defiance, resilience, submission, lamentation, all these states followed one another, as did the images of sunken cheeks, pale skin, wrinkled hands, and emaciated bodies.</t156> <t157>But it was almost always the same face, and all the heads soon turned white.</t157> <t158>Hundreds of times, the drowsy passenger asked this ghost: −</t158> <t159>How long have you been buried? The answer was always: “Nearly eighteen years.” −</t159> <t160>Have you given up all hope of being unearthed? −</t160> <t161>Long ago.</t161>
<t162>− Do you know that you have been resurrected? −</t162> <t163>I've heard so.</t163>
<t164>− Do you still want to live? −</t164> <t165>It's hard to say.</t165>
<t166>− Should I bring her to you?</t166> <t167>Or do you want to go meet her? This question was answered differently each time and often contradictorily.</t167> <t168>Sometimes the choked response was: "Wait!</t168> <t169>I'll die if I see her again too soon."</t169> <t170>Sometimes, the ghost, with tears streaming down and emotionally, said: "Let me meet her."</t170> <t171>Sometimes the ghost stared blankly, bewildered, and then the answer was: "I don't know her.</t171> <t172>I don't understand." After such an imaginary conversation, the passenger in the dream would dig, dig, and dig - sometimes using a shovel, sometimes using a large key, sometimes using his bare hands - to unearth that wretched soul from the ground.</t172>
<t173>Finally, that person stepped out of the grave, with dirt clinging to his face and hair, and suddenly he disintegrated into dust.</t173> <t174>At that moment, the guest was startled awake from the dream, lowered the window to let the mist and rain hit his face, and returned to reality.</t174>
<t175>However, when his eyes opened wide to look into the misty rain, at the moving streaks of light from the car headlights, and at the fence by the roadside receding into the distance, the shadows outside in the night still blended into the chain of spirits in the carriage.</t175> <t176>The real bank near Temple Bar, the actual work of yesterday, the real bank vaults, the urgent messages that had chased him, and the reply messages, all remained intact.</t176> <t177>From within that chaos, the ghostly face reappeared, and he began to converse with it once more.</t177>
<t178>− How long has it been buried? −</t178> <t179>Nearly eighteen years.</t179>
<t180>− I hope you still want to live? −</t180> <t181>It's hard to say.</t181>
<t182>Dig... dig... dig... until a hasty movement from one of the two companions reminded him to close the window tightly, thread his arm securely through the leather strap, then ponder over the two figures dozing off, until his mind drifted again and everything turned into a bank and a grave.</t182>
<t183>− How long has it been buried? −</t183> <t184>Nearly eighteen years.</t184>
<t185>− Have you given up all hope of exhuming the grave? −</t185> <t186>Long ago.</t186>
<t187>Those words still echo in the ears as if they were just spoken - clearly audible as if those words had been uttered in real life - when this weary traveler began to realize that dawn had broken, and the ghosts and spirits had vanished.</t187>
<t188>He lowered the window and looked out at the rising sun.</t188> <t189>Out there was a patch of farmland with a furrow left unfinished from the previous evening when the horses had been unhitched; in the distance was a quiet grove of low trees, many of whose leaves had turned red and golden but still clung to the branches.</t189> <t190>Though the ground was still wet and cold, the sky was clear and the sun rose brightly, serenely, and radiantly.</t190>
<t191>− Eighteen years! - The guest exclaimed while looking at the sun.</t191> <t192>- Thank God! Eighteen years buried alive!</t192>
<t193>4.</t193> <t194>Preparation</t194>
<t195>When the mail coach arrived in Dover in the morning, the General Manager of the Royal George Hotel opened the door of the coach out of habit.</t195> <t196>He pulled the door open with a somewhat ceremonious gesture because a mail coach arriving from London in the winter was an achievement worthy of celebration for the daring travelers on board.</t196>
<t197>At that time, there was only one daring passenger left to celebrate as the other two had successively disembarked at various stops along the way.</t197> <t198>The carriage was musty with damp, dirty straw, an unpleasant odor, and darkness that made the inside no different from a large dog kennel.</t198> <t199>Shaking off the straw clinging to his boots, Mr. Lorry, that passenger, in his shaggy fur coat, soft-brimmed hat, and mud-caked boots, also looked like a large dog.</t199>
<t200>− Will there be a mail ship to Calais tomorrow, Mr. Superintendent? −</t200> <t201>Yes, there will be, if the weather is good and the wind is favorable.</t201> <t202>The tide will be very convenient for the ship to set sail around two in the afternoon, sir.</t202> <t203>Rest immediately, right? −</t203> <t204>We can only rest in the evening; but I need a room and a barber right away.</t204>
<t205>− And breakfast, sir? Yes, please.</t205> <t206>This way, sir, please.</t206> <t207>Take the guest to the Concord room! Bring this gentleman's luggage and hot water to the Concord room.</t207> <t208>Take off this gentleman's shoes in the Concord room.</t208> <t209>(You will find a very warm coal fireplace, sir.) Call the barber to the Concord room. Hurry up, the Concord room! The Concord room is always reserved for mail coach passengers, and every mail coach passenger is always wrapped up from head to toe, so the peculiar characteristic of this room in the Royal George Hotel is that everyone looks the same going in, but coming out, they are all different kinds of people.</t209> <t210>Therefore, another manager, two porters, several maids, and the landlady who happened to be scattered between the Concord room and the dining room encountered a distinguished sixty-year-old gentleman, dressed in a formal brown suit, though worn but still neat, with large square cuffs and wide pocket flaps, on his way to breakfast.</t210>
<t211>The dining room had no other guests that morning except for the nobleman in a brown coat.</t211> <t212>The dining table was pulled up to the fireplace, and while he sat waiting for his meal in the firelight, he remained so still that it seemed as if he were posing for a portrait.</t212>
<t213>He looked very upright and neat with his hands placed on his knees, the pocket watch under his buttoned-up waistcoat ticking loudly and steadily as if it was arrogantly comparing its own dignity and longevity with the frivolity and transience of the flickering firelight.</t213> <t214>He had strong legs and took some pride in them, as his brown socks were of the finest quality, tightly woven and fitting snugly around his calves; his shoes and buckles were simple yet elegant.</t214> <t215>He wore a small, light brown wig curled on both sides and strangely glossy, fitting closely to his head - wigs were usually made from human hair, but this one seemed to be spun from silk or fiberglass.</t215> <t216>Though not of the same fine quality as his socks, his shirt was as white as the waves crashing near the hotel shore, or like the sparkling spots of the sails in the distant sunlight.</t216> <t217>Underneath that peculiar wig, his calm face, accustomed to restraining emotions, still shone thanks to his bright, wet eyes; over the years, those eyes must have had a hard time learning to exhibit the composed and indifferent demeanor of a Tellson's Bank employee.</t217> <t218>His cheeks were rosy and healthy, and though his face bore wrinkles, it showed little sign of worry.</t218> <t219>Perhaps because the solitary employees at Tellson's mainly concerned themselves with the world's affairs, such impersonal concerns, like clothes that had passed through two owners, were often easily changed.</t219>
<t220>The stiff demeanor of someone posing for a portrait was gone, and Mr. Lorry dozed off, only waking up when breakfast was brought in.</t220> <t221>As he moved his chair closer to the dining table, he said to the server: −</t221> <t222>"I want to prepare a large room for a lady who may arrive here at any time today."</t222> <t223>"She might request to see Mr. Jarvis Lorry, or she might simply ask to see a gentleman from Tellson's Bank."</t223> <t224>"Let me know when she arrives."</t224>
<t225>− Yes, sir. The Tellson Bank in London, sir? − Correct.</t225>
<t226>− Yes, sir.</t226> <t227>We have also had the honor of welcoming many gentlemen from this bank who travel back and forth between London and Paris many times, sir.</t227>
<t228>They often go, sir, the people of Tellson's and the Association.</t228>
<t229>− Correct.</t229> <t230>Our company operates both in France and in England.</t230>
<t231>− Yes, sir. And you probably don't travel far often, do you, sir? −</t231> <t232>Not in recent years.</t232> <t233>It's been fifteen years since we... since I... last returned from France.</t233>
<t234>− Is that so, sir? Even before I started working here, sir.</t234>
<t235>Before all of us worked here.</t235> <t236>At that time, this George Hotel belonged to a different owner.</t236>
<t237>− I think so too.</t237>
<t238>− But sir, I am sure that a company like Tellson and Company has been prosperous for fifty years, let alone fifteen years ago? −</t238> <t239>You could say three times that, one hundred and fifty years, and still not be wrong.</t239>
<t240>− Really, sir? Eyes wide and mouth agape, the server stepped back from the dining table, transferred the napkin from his right arm to his left, adopted a more relaxed posture, and observed the guest eating as if standing on a watchtower or guard post.</t240>
<t241>True to the age-old habits of the waiting profession.</t241>
<t242>After finishing his breakfast, Mr. Lorry went out for a walk on the beach.</t242> <t243>The city of Dover, winding, narrow, and small, nestled away from the shore, with one end jutting straight into the chalk cliffs like an ostrich burying its head in the sea.</t243> <t244>The deserted beach had only waves tossing stones around; the sea did whatever it pleased, and its pleasure was destruction.</t244> <t245>The sea thundered down on the city, thundered down on the cliffs, and madly pounded the shore.</t245> <t246>The air between the houses was so fishy that one might think all the sick fish had come to immerse themselves in the town like sick people soaking in seawater.</t246> <t247>Few fished in this port, but at night many loitered around and looked out to sea - especially during high tides and near floods.</t247> <t248>Many petty traders who did no business at all sometimes inexplicably amassed great fortunes, and it was notable that no one in this area was comfortable with the night lamp-lighter*.</t248>
<t249>When the day had turned to evening, the sky that had occasionally cleared up enough to see the shores of France across the sea was now shrouded in mist, and Mr. Lorry's thoughts seemed to be shrouded as well.</t249> <t250>As night fell, he sat before the fireplace in the dining room waiting for his meal just as he had waited for breakfast that morning, his mind busy digging, digging, and digging into the glowing embers.</t250>
<t251>A good bottle of red wine after dinner wouldn't harm the coal miner, except that the alcohol made him distracted from his digging.</t251> <t252>He had been sitting there for a long time and had just filled his last glass with a completely satisfied look - often seen in elderly people with rosy cheeks who have just finished a bottle - when the sound of rattling wheels echoed on the narrow road and then thundered into the hotel yard.</t252>
<t253>He put down the untouched glass of wine.</t253>
<t254>− The young lady has arrived! - He exclaimed.</t254>
<t255>Just a few minutes later, the waiter from earlier came in to announce that Miss Manette from London had arrived and was ready to meet the gentleman from Tellson's Bank.</t255>
<t256>− So quick? −</t256> <t257>Miss Manette has already had a break on the way, so she doesn't need to rest and is very eager to meet the gentleman from Tellson's Bank immediately, if it is convenient and comfortable for him.</t257>
<t258>The gentleman from Tellson's Bank didn't know what else to do but down his drink with a hidden look of despair, smooth the sides of his peculiar small auburn wig, and follow the waiter to Miss Manette.</t258> <t259>It was a large, gloomy room, filled with a mournful atmosphere, furnished with black horsehair-upholstered chairs and several heavy, dark-colored tables.</t259> <t260>The tables had been polished many times, yet the two tall candles on the main table in the center of the room only cast a faint reflection on every surface; it was as if those candles were also buried in the deep grave of the dark mahogany wood, with no hope of light unless their corpses were exhumed.</t260>
<t261>The room was so dark that Mr. Lorry, while groping his way on the worn-out Turkish carpet, thought that Miss Manette was in an adjacent room, until he passed by two tall candles and saw a young girl, no older than seventeen, standing to greet him by the table placed between them and the fireplace. She was wearing a riding cloak and still holding the ribbon of her straw traveling hat.</t261> <t262>When his eyes settled on the delicate, pretty figure, with long flowing blonde hair and blue eyes that met his gaze with a questioning look, and a forehead (so youthful and smooth) that had the characteristic of often furrowing into wrinkles that were not exactly of confusion, or surprise, or alarm, or merely of attentive sharpness, although displaying all those emotions - looking at the girl, he suddenly vividly recalled the image of a child he had carried in his arms while crossing this very strait on a cold day with pouring rain and rough seas. That association vanished quickly like breath on the narrow long mirror mounted on the wall behind the girl, on the frame of which was carved a group of wretched, mostly headless, and all chipped angels, offering a wretched basket of Dead Sea fruits to a wretched saint - and so he solemnly bowed to Miss Manette.</t262>
<t263>− Please have a seat, sir. - That youthful voice was very gentle and clear, with a hint of a foreign accent, but it was fleeting.</t263>
<t264>− May I kiss your hand, miss, - Mr. Lorry said with old-fashioned courtesy as he respectfully bowed again and then sat down.</t264>
<t265>− Yesterday I received a letter from the Bank, sir, informing me that there is news... or a discovery...</t265>
<t266>− Words are not important, miss, you can use any term.</t266>
<t267>− ... something about the small property of the poor father whom I had never met... who had passed away long ago...</t267>
<t268>Mr. Lorry fidgeted in his chair and anxiously glanced at the group of pitiful black angels carved on the mirror frame.</t268> <t269>As if they could help with those ridiculous baskets! − ... said that I need to go to Paris, to contact a gentleman from the bank, who is very trustworthy and has been sent to Paris for this matter.</t269>
<t270>− That's me.</t270>
<t271>− Just as I thought, sir.</t271>
<t272>She curtsied to him (back then, young women often greeted like that) with the good intention of expressing respect for the age and superior wisdom of the person opposite.</t272> <t273>He bowed to the girl once more.</t273>
<t274>− I replied to the bank, sir, that if knowledgeable people with good intentions advised me, and if it was deemed necessary, I would go to France. However, since I no longer have parents and no friends who can accompany me, I would be very grateful if that esteemed person could protect me on the journey.</t274>
<t275>That gentleman has left London, but I think it is necessary to send a liaison to catch up with him and ask him to agree to wait for me here.</t275>
<t276>− I am very pleased to be entrusted with this responsibility, - Mr. Lorry said.</t276> <t277>- I am even happier to carry it out.</t277>
<t278>− Sincerely thank you, sir.</t278> <t279>I am very grateful to you.</t279> <t280>The bank informed me that you would explain the matter in detail to me, and I should be mentally prepared for some shocking events.</t280> <t281>I am already prepared, and of course, I am eager to know what this matter is.</t281>
<t282>− Certainly, - Mr. Lorry said. - Yes... I...</t282>
<t283>After a moment of hesitation, he continued speaking while smoothing the sides of his curly brown wig: −</t283> <t284>It is indeed very difficult to start.</t284>
<t285>He didn't get straight to the point but hesitated, looking into the girl's eyes.</t285> <t286>Her youthful forehead furrowed into that distinctive wrinkle - yet still beautiful and full of character - she raised her hand as if in an involuntary reaction, or as if trying to grasp a fleeting illusion.</t286>
<t287>− Surely you have met me before, haven't you? −</t287> <t288>Really? - Mr. Lorry spread his hands and opened his arms with a smile implying denial.</t288>
<t289>Between her eyebrows and right above her petite nose, with extremely delicate and slender features, a deep expressive wrinkle appeared as she thoughtfully sat down on the chair she had been standing next to.</t289> <t290>He looked at the pensive girl and waited for her to look up before continuing: −</t290> <t291>In the country you have adopted as your homeland, I suppose I should call you "Miss" as I do the young ladies of England, Miss Manette? −</t291> <t292>Yes, sir, as you wish.</t292>
<t293>− Miss Manette, I am a man of business.</t293> <t294>I have a responsibility to fulfill.</t294> <t295>While you listen to my presentation, please consider me as nothing more than a speaking machine.</t295> <t296>Miss, allow me to recount the story of one of our clients.</t296>
<t297>− The story! He seemed to deliberately misunderstand the word the girl had just repeated as he hastily continued: −</t297> <t298>Yes, client; in the banking industry, we often refer to customers as clients.</t298> <t299>He is a French gentleman; a gentleman in the field of science; a highly educated and knowledgeable person... a doctor.</t299>
<t300>− Not in Beauvais, is it? − Oh, yes, in Beauvais.</t300> <t301>Just like Lord Manette, this gentleman is also in Beauvais.</t301> <t302>Just like Lord Manette, this gentleman is a well-known figure in Paris.</t302> <t303>I had the honor of knowing him there.</t303> <t304>Our relationship was a business one, but very close.</t304> <t305>At that time, I was working at the branch in France, and it has been...</t305> <t306>oh! Twenty years already.</t306>
<t307>− At that time... may I ask, when was that, sir? −</t307> <t308>I just mentioned it, miss, twenty years ago.</t308> <t309>He got married... to an English lady... and I was one of the witnesses at the wedding.</t309> <t310>His personal affairs, like those of many other French gentlemen and French families, were all entrusted to Tellson's.</t310> <t311>Similarly, I am, or have been, the authorized person for all sorts of personal matters of the clients.</t311> <t312>These were purely business relationships, miss; not friendships, no special interest, no emotions at all.</t312> <t313>Throughout my business life, I moved from one task to another, just as I moved from one client to another in a working day; in short, I had no emotions; I was just a machine.</t313> <t314>Let me continue...</t314>
<t315>− But it sounds like a story about my father, sir; and I begin to think that, - that strangely furrowed brow directed straight at him, - when I became an orphan because my mother passed away only two years after my father, it was you who brought me back to England.</t315> <t316>I am almost certain it was you.</t316>
<t317>Mr. Lorry took the small hand that was hesitantly offered to him and raised it to his lips somewhat ceremoniously.</t317> <t318>Then he immediately helped the girl sit back down as before, with his left hand holding the back of the chair, his right hand alternately stroking his chin and tugging at the sides of his wig, or gesturing as he spoke, while he looked down at the girl as she looked up at him.</t318>
<t319>− Miss Manette, it is I.</t319> <t320>You will see how honest I am about myself when I say that I have no feelings, and all my dealings with others are purely business transactions, if you remember that I have not seen you again.</t320> <t321>Not at all; since then you have been cared for by Tellson's, and I have been busy with other matters for Tellson's.</t321> <t322>Feelings! I have no time, no opportunity for such things.</t322> <t323>All my life, ma'am, I have only known how to work for a gigantic financial machine.</t323>
<t324>After finishing his strange description of his usual daily work, Mr. Lorry pressed both hands flat against his yellow-brown wig (an unnecessary action as the shiny hair could not be any flatter), then continued in the same manner: −</t324> <t325>Miss, as you have seen, the story so far resembles that of your poor father.</t325> <t326>Now comes the difference.</t326> <t327>If your father had never died...</t327> <t328>Don't be alarmed! You are startled!</t328> <t329>Indeed, the girl was startled.</t329> <t330>And she clasped both her hands around his wrist.</t330>
<t331>− Calm down, - Mr. Lorry said in a soothing voice as he withdrew his left hand from the back of the chair and placed it on the girl's trembling fingers that were clasped tightly. - Please calm down... it's just business.</t331> <t332>I was just saying that...</t332>
<t333>Her eyes were so bewildered that he had to stop speaking, lost in thought, and then start over: −</t333> <t334>I just said that if Monsieur Manette had never died; if he had suddenly disappeared without a trace; if he had been taken far away to some terrible place, which would not be hard to guess but impossible to trace; if he had a fellow countryman who was an enemy with the privilege that, in my lifetime, I know, even the boldest on the other side of the channel only dared to mention him in whispers; for instance, the privilege to fill in blank warrants that could throw anyone into the indefinite oblivion of prison; if this man's wife had pleaded with the King, the Queen, the Court, and the Church for news of her husband but still received no response... if so, then your father's story would be the story of that unfortunate gentleman, the doctor in Beauvais.</t334>
<t335>− I beg you, please explain further.</t335>
<t336>− I will speak.</t336> <t337>I am about to speak now.</t337> <t338>Can you bear it? −</t338> <t339>I can bear anything, except the uncertainty you are making me endure.</t339>
<t340>− She spoke very calmly, and she... also appeared calm.</t340> <t341>That's good!</t341> <t342>His tone was not as satisfied as his words suggested.</t342> <t343>- It's just business.</t343> <t344>Just consider it a job, something that needs to be completed.</t344>
<t345>Then if the wife of this doctor, although a woman of great courage and determination, also had to suffer immensely because of that situation before giving birth to a child...</t345>
<t346>− That child must be a girl, sir.</t346>
<t347>− Little girl. It's... it's just work... don't be sad.</t347>
<t348>Dear miss, if this poor lady had suffered so much before the child was born, to the extent that she was determined to spare her child from any suffering that she herself had endured, by raising the child and teaching it to believe that its father was dead...</t348>
<t349>Don't, don't kneel down!</t349> <t350>Oh my God, why are you kneeling in front of me! −</t350> <t351>For the truth.</t351> <t352>Oh, please, merciful sir, have pity, tell the truth! −</t352> <t353>It's... it's just about work.</t353> <t354>You are making me confused, and how can I solve work matters when I'm confused? We need to be clear-headed.</t354> <t355>Please kindly tell me, for instance, how much is nine times nine pence, or how many shillings are in twenty guineas, that would be much better.</t355> <t356>I would feel more at ease about your state of mind.</t356>
<t357>Without bothering to respond to that plea, Manette sat silently after he had helped her onto the chair. The girl's hands still gripped Mr. Jarvis Lorry's wrist, but they no longer trembled as they had earlier, which made him somewhat reassured.</t357>
<t358>− Good, good.</t358> <t359>Be brave! It's work time!</t359> <t360>You have work to take care of; important work.</t360> <t361>Miss Manette, your mother decided this for you.</t361> <t362>And until she passed away... surely with a broken heart... she never stopped searching for your father in vain, leaving you, then just two years old, to grow up fresh, beautiful, and happy, with a life unclouded by the worry of whether your father had perished early in prison or was languishing there for many years.</t362>
<t363>When he uttered those words, he looked down at Manette's flowing blonde hair with an expression of both admiration and pity, as if he were silently imagining that her hair might already have many strands of gray.</t363>
<t364>− Surely you know that your parents do not have much wealth, and whatever they had has been entirely devoted to you and your mother.</t364> <t365>There has been no new discovery regarding money or any other assets; but...</t365>
<t366>He felt his wrist being squeezed tighter, and he stopped speaking.</t366> <t367>The wrinkle on that forehead, which had particularly caught his attention, now became immobile, etched deeply into a terrifying pain.</t367>
<t368>− But he... they found him.</t368> <t369>He is still alive.</t369> <t370>Changed a lot, perhaps; almost an invalid, possibly; even so, we must hope for the best, still alive.</t370> <t371>Your father has been taken to an old servant's house in Paris, and we will go there.</t371> <t372>My job is to correctly identify him, if possible; your job is to bring him life, love, filial duty, peace, and comfort.</t372>
<t373>A shiver ran through her body, and it spread to him as well.</t373> <t374>She spoke in a low, halting voice, full of fear as if she were speaking in a dream: −</t374> <t375>We will see the ghost of my father! It will be the ghost of my father... not my father himself! Mr. Lorry quietly stroked the hands that were clinging to his arm.</t375>
<t376>− There, there, there!</t376> <t377>It's clear now, it's clear! You now know the best and the worst things.</t377> <t378>You must set out to meet that poor wronged gentleman, just one peaceful sea voyage and another peaceful land journey, and you will soon be with your loved one.</t378>
<t379>The girl repeated the old tone, this time like a whisper: −</t379> <t380>I have lived freely, I have lived joyfully, but my father's ghost has never haunted me! −</t380> <t381>One more thing, - Mr. Lorry said, emphasizing each word with the good intention that the girl must listen, - they have found your father under another name; his real name has been forgotten or kept hidden for a long time.</t381>
<t382>Now, asking for the name wouldn't be of any benefit; asking who was negligent or intentionally kept him imprisoned all these years wouldn't be of any benefit either.</t382> <t383>Now, asking anything would do more harm than good.</t383>
<t384>It is best not to bring that matter up, anywhere, in any form, he must be taken out of France... at least for a while.</t384>
<t385>Even I, being safe because I am a British citizen, and even this Tellson's Bank, despite its powerful influence due to its high reputation with the French, avoid bringing up this matter.</t385> <t386>I do not carry a single piece of paper that directly mentions this matter.</t386> <t387>This is entirely a secret operation.</t387>
<t388>All the authorizations, guarantees, and confirmations given to me are encapsulated in one phrase "resurrection," interpret it as you will.</t388> <t389>But saying it is as good as saying nothing!</t389> <t390>She wouldn't listen anyway! Miss Manette!</t390> <t391>Sitting still like a statue, not even leaning back in the chair, still clinging to his arm but Manette had completely fainted; her eyes still wide open looking at him, the final look of astonishment seemed to be carved or deeply etched into her forehead.</t391> <t392>Manette clung tightly to Mr. Lorry's arm to the point that he feared he would hurt her if he tried to remove her hand; so he had to endure and loudly called for help.</t392>
<t393>A coarse-looking woman barged into the room ahead of the group of servants in the inn.</t393> <t394>Even in his bewildered state, Mr. Lorry noticed that she was entirely red, from her red hair to her unusually tight-fitting attire, and the enormous bonnet on her head that looked both like a guard's helmet and a large wooden grain measure, or a big round of cheese.</t394> <t395>This person immediately resolved the issue of separating the old man from the poor young girl by placing a strong hand on his chest and shoving him back against the nearest wall.</t395>
<t396>("What kind of woman is as strong as a man!" That was Mr. Lorry's thought as he crashed into the wall, almost out of breath.) −</t396> <t397>Hey, look at you all! - She shouted at the helpers.</t397> <t398>- Why aren't you getting the necessary things and just standing there staring at me? What's there to look at?</t398> <t399>Why aren't you getting the things? I'm telling you, if you don't bring salt to smell, cold water, and vinegar here quickly, I'll go get them myself.</t399>
<t400>The servants immediately dispersed to fetch items to help revive her, while she gently laid Manette on the couch, tending to her with utmost skill and tenderness, constantly calling her "darling!" and "dear!" and proudly and carefully smoothing the girl's flowing blonde hair over her shoulders.</t400>
<t401>− And you, the man in the brown coat! - She angrily turned back to Mr. Lorry.</t401> <t402>- If there's something worth saying, then say it, but why scare her to death like this?</t402> <t403>Look at her, her face is pale, and her hands are ice-cold.</t403> <t404>How can a bank employee act like that?</t404> <t405>Mr. Lorry became flustered by the difficult question, to the point that he could only stand from a distance, looking on with a sympathetic and humble expression, trying to suppress his emotions while the strong woman, after driving away the servants with a mysterious threat of punishment - "I'll show you" - without clarifying what they would know if they dared to stand there staring, continued her task of gradually reviving Manette and comforting the girl who had her head resting on her shoulder.</t405>
<t406>− Hopefully, she has recovered, - Mr. Lorry said.</t406>
<t407>− Even if I recover, it won't be thanks to that man in the brown robe.</t407> <t408>Oh, little girl! −</t408> <t409>I hope, - Mr. Lorry continued after a moment of compassionate and humble hesitation, - that you can accompany Miss Manette to France, right? −</t409> <t410>Such sweet talk! - The strong woman retorted. - If my fate forces me to cross the sea and go abroad, would God banish me to some island?</t410> <t411>This was yet another difficult question to answer, so Mr. Jarvis Lorry had to retreat to his private room to ponder.</t411>
<t412>5.</t412> <t413>Tavern</t413>
<t414>A large barrel of wine fell and broke on the street.</t414> <t415>While it was being unloaded from the cart, the incident occurred; the barrel rolled too quickly, the hoops came loose, and it shattered like a walnut shell on the stone pavement in front of the tavern.</t415>
<t416>Everyone nearby immediately stopped their work or ceased idling to rush over and drink the wine on the spot.</t416><t417>The rough, uneven, and sharp-edged paving stones, seemingly arranged solely to cripple any living creature that approached, blocked the flowing wine, forming small puddles; around each puddle, people gathered, crowding in groups depending on the size of the puddle.</t417><t418>Some knelt down, cupping their hands to scoop up the wine and sip it; or raised their hands high to let some women leaning over their shoulders drink before the wine trickled through their fingers.</t418><t419>Others, both men and women, dipped chipped earthenware cups into the puddles; or even soaked their headscarves in the liquid to wring it into the mouths of infants they were carrying; some scooped up mud to build barriers to stop the wine from spreading; some, following the instructions of those watching from high windows, ran around to redirect the flow of wine that had started to move in another direction; some focused solely on licking the wet remnants of wine from broken barrel pieces, even gleefully gnawing on the damp, wine-soaked wood.</t419><t420>With no drains for the wine to escape, people not only drank all the spilled wine but also swallowed the mud carried along with it, cleaning it up so thoroughly that one might think a street sweeper had just passed by, if anyone familiar with this impoverished neighborhood could believe in such a miraculous occurrence.</t420>
<t421>The loud laughter, the enthusiastic voices - men's, women's, and children's alike - made the street lively with this drinking game.</t421> <t422>A game that is somewhat crude but full of joy. A game with a special camaraderie, clearly everyone is eager to join in; especially for those who are carefree or luckier than others, this camaraderie urges them to embrace each other joyfully; toast to health; shake hands; even a dozen people might hold hands and dance.</t422> <t423>When the wine is gone, and the places with the most wine left are just streaks of fingers scraping, this lively gathering ends as abruptly as it began.</t423> <t424>The man who earlier left the saw stuck in the log now resumes sawing; the woman who earlier hastily put down the jar of hot ashes to soothe the aching, bony fingers and toes of herself or her children now picks up the jar again; the few men in sleeveless shirts, with disheveled hair and haggard faces who had come up from the basements to warm themselves in the winter sun now disperse and return to the basement; and the scene once again sinks into its familiar gloom rather than remaining cheerful.</t424>
<t425>Wine is the red wine that has dyed the narrow street of Saint Antoine district in Paris red.</t425> <t426>Wine also dyed many hands and faces, many bare feet and many wooden shoes red.</t426> <t427>The woodcutter's hand left red marks on the logs; the forehead of the breastfeeding mother was stained red by the wine that soaked the rag now wrapped around her head.</t427> <t428>Those who had eagerly gnawed on the wine barrel pieces now had fiercely red-streaked mouths; and a mischievous person, also smeared red with a filthy long nightcap almost falling off his head, dipped his finger into the mushy wine residue and scrawled a word on the wall - BLOOD.</t428>
<t429>Then there will come a time when that red liquid will also flow over the stone road, and it will also soak many people there.</t429>
<t430>And now the fog has covered Saint Antoine after a brief moment of brightness, the face of the neighborhood named after the saint* is once again as dark as before with cold, filth, disease, ignorance, and poverty - the five companions of the saint, each powerful, but the last one is the most dreadful.</t430> <t431>At every street corner, entering every threshold, standing in every window, wrapped in every ragged garment fluttering in the wind, are the people who have been crushed and ground in the machine of poverty.</t431>
<t432>The machine that molded them is a machine that turns the young into the old; children with elderly faces and serious voices; and on every face, both young and old, deeply etched in the wrinkles of age, there is a glaring sign: Hunger. Hunger is evident everywhere.</t432> <t433>Hunger oozes from the tall houses, in the tattered clothes hanging on poles and lines; hunger patched, mended, combined, and glued together with straw, rags, wood, and paper; hunger manifests itself in every splinter of wood from the sawyer; hunger glares down from the smokeless chimneys, strides along the filthy, garbage-strewn streets where not a single edible scrap can be found.</t433> <t434>Hunger carves its name on the shelves of the baker, writes on each tiny, stale loaf of bread in the meager stock; leaves its mark at the sausage shop selling concoctions made from dead dog meat.</t434> <t435>Hunger crackles, rattling through the dry bones among the roasted chestnuts in the oven; hunger disintegrates into atoms in the low-grade bowls containing slices of unpeeled potatoes, fried with a few precious drops of oil.</t435>
<t436>As the person is, so is the dream.</t436> <t437>A narrow, winding road, full of unpleasant and foul things, branching into many other narrow, winding roads, everywhere one sees people in ragged clothes wearing nightcaps, everyone reeking, filthy, with miserable, sickly faces.</t437> <t438>In the appearance of those people, there still lies the instinct of resistance of wild beasts being hunted to the end.</t438> <t439>Though gloomy and desperate, their eyes still blaze with fire; their tightly pressed lips are pale from restraint; their foreheads, furrowed like ropes on a gallows, still harbor thoughts of resignation or revenge.</t439> <t440>The signs on every shop almost all harshly illustrate poverty.</t440> <t441>The butcher shops only depict the least nutritious scraps of meat; the bakeries show thin loaves made from the worst flour.</t441> <t442>The tavern signs crudely depict people sitting and drinking inside, with grim and suspiciously secretive faces beside their meager portions of beer and liquor.</t442> <t443>Nothing is depicted as prosperous, except for tools and weapons; yet the axes on the hardware store signs look sharp and gleaming, the hammers on the blacksmith signs look heavy, and the goods in the gun shops look menacing. The cobblestone streets are dangerously uneven, with muddy puddles, lacking sidewalks that abruptly cut off in front of houses.</t443> <t444>In contrast, the sewers run right down the middle of the street - if they aren't clogged, which they only clear after heavy rains, and when they do, ironically, the water floods into the houses.</t444> <t445>On both sides of the street, at regular intervals, there is a rickety lamp hanging high by a rope and pulley; in the evening, the lamplighter lowers them, lights them, and then raises them again, a cluster of dimly burning wicks swaying overhead as if they were seasick offshore.</t445> <t446>And indeed they are offshore, and both the ship and its crew are in peril from the storm.</t446>
<t447>Because it will soon come to the time when the ragged, gaunt figures like scarecrows in this area, who have long been sitting idly with empty stomachs watching the night lamp-lighters, will think of a way to improve their dark situation by using those ropes and pulleys to hang people.</t447> <t448>But that time has not yet come, and every gust of wind blowing through France still desperately stirs the tattered rags of the scarecrows, because the birds with the most beautiful feathers and the sweetest songs have not yet felt any fear or need for caution.</t448>
<t449>The tavern is a shop located right at the corner of the street, its exterior and value are quite better than many other shops, and the owner is wearing a yellow tight shirt and green tight pants that go past the knees, having been standing at the door watching the scene of people scrambling to drink spilled wine.</t449>
<t450>− Not my business, - he said with a decisive shrug.</t450> <t451>- If the store's people broke this barrel, they have to deliver another one.</t451>
<t452>Then his eyes accidentally caught sight of the tall, lanky guy jokingly writing on the wall, he called out across the street: −</t452> <t453>Hey there, Gaspard, what are you doing over there?</t453> <t454>The guy, extremely pleased with himself, pointed to his prank, like mischievous kids often show off to each other.</t454> <t455>The prank wasn't funny, didn't cause any laughter at all, just like the antics of this rowdy bunch.</t455>
<t456>− So what? Do you want to go to the mental hospital? - The bartender said as he crossed the street, scooped up a handful of mud, and smeared it on the wall to erase the mischievous writing. - Why are you scribbling on public streets? Is there no other place... tell me... is there really no other place to write this?</t456> <t457>Whether accidentally or not, he protested while wiping his still clean hand on the chest of the prankster.</t457> <t458>The other guy slapped his hand, jumped up, then landed and stood with his leg raised in a strange dance pose, yanking off his dirty shoe and holding it out in front of him.</t458>
<t459>In this appearance, that clownish guy looked extremely cunning, if not outright vicious.</t459>
<t460>"Put your shoes on, put them on," the innkeeper said.</t460> <t461>"Go find some wine to drink, it's over." After saying that, he deliberately wiped his dirty hand on the thug's shirt because that guy was the reason his hand got dirty; then he crossed the street and entered the tavern.</t461>
<t462>The owner of the shop was about thirty years old, with a thick neck and a military demeanor, surely a hot-tempered person because even in the freezing cold, he only draped his coat over his shoulder instead of wearing it.</t462> <t463>The sleeves of his shirt were rolled up high, exposing his sun-tanned arms up to the elbows.</t463> <t464>On his head, he wore nothing to cover his short, tightly curled black hair.</t464> <t465>His skin was dark, and his sharp eyes were set wide apart.</t465> <t466>Overall, his face appeared cheerful but also stubborn; clearly a very determined and principled person; someone no one would want to confront when he was charging down a narrow path between two deep chasms, for nothing could make this person turn back.</t466>
<t467>Mrs. Defarge, his wife, was sitting behind the counter in the shop when he walked in.</t467> <t468>She was a stout woman around his age, with vigilant eyes that seemed to rarely look directly at anything, a large hand adorned with rings; a serene face with sharp features, and an extremely calm demeanor.</t468> <t469>Mrs. Defarge exuded something that made one think that this mistress rarely made mistakes in matters of money calculation.</t469> <t470>Unable to bear the cold, Mrs. Defarge wrapped herself tightly in a fur coat, with a large, brightly colored scarf twisted around her head but still revealing large hoop earrings.</t470> <t471>The knitting lay in front of her, but she had stopped knitting to pick her teeth with a toothpick.</t471> <t472>Her left hand supporting her right elbow as she picked her teeth, Mrs. Defarge said nothing when her husband walked in, only clearing her throat softly.</t472> <t473>Accompanying the throat clearing, her thick dark eyebrows above the toothpick raised slightly, signaling to her husband to look around at the customers in the shop to see who had come in while he was across the street.</t473>
<t474>Understanding the intention, the shop owner glanced around until his eyes stopped at a spot where an elderly nobleman and a young lady were sitting in the corner of the room.</t474>
<t475>There were still many customers in the bar: two people were playing cards, two were playing dominoes, and three were standing by the counter trying to savor their meager glasses of wine.</t475> <t476>As he walked behind the counter, he noticed the distinguished old man giving the girl a look that implied: "This is my person."</t476>
<t477>“What are you people doing coming to this godforsaken place?” Mr. Defarge muttered to himself.</t477> <t478>“I don't know them at all.”</t478> <t479>He pretended not to see the two strangers and started a conversation with the three customers drinking at the counter.</t479>
<t480>− How did it go, Jacques? - One of the three asked Defarge. - Is all the spilled wine gone? −</t480> <t481>Not a drop left, Jacques, - Defarge replied.*</t481> <t482>Hearing this exchange of names, Madame Defarge, still holding a toothpick, cleared her throat again and raised her eyebrows a little higher.</t482>
<t483>− How often do they get to drink, - the second person in the trio said to Mr. Defarge, - those poor wretches rarely get to taste wine or anything other than black bread and death.</t483> <t484>Isn't that right, Jacques? −</t484> <t485>That's right, Jacques, - Mr. Defarge replied.</t485>
<t486>The second time she heard them call each other "Jacques," still calmly picking her teeth, Madame Defarge cleared her throat softly and raised her eyebrows a little higher.</t486>
<t487>The last person in the trio finally spoke up after setting down the empty glass of wine and smacking his lips.</t487>
<t488>− Ah! That makes it even worse! Those poor people always swallow their bitterness, living a life as hard as oxen, Jacques.</t488> <t489>Am I right, Jacques? −</t489> <t490>You are right, Jacques, - Defarge agreed.</t490>
<t491>This third time of calling the name ended just as Madame Defarge took out the toothpick, her eyebrows still raised, and shifted noisily in her chair.</t491>
<t492>− Wait! Hold on! - The husband mumbled. - Gentlemen... this is my wife!</t492> <t493>The three guests lifted their hats and waved their hands respectfully to Mrs. Defarge. To acknowledge their respect, she bowed in return, quickly glancing at all three of them.</t493> <t494>Then she calmly looked around the tavern as usual, serenely and leisurely picked up her knitting, and focused on it.</t494>
<t495>− Wishing you gentlemen a good day, - the husband, who had been watching his wife without taking his eyes off her, spoke again.</t495> <t496>- The room set up for single men that you wanted to see and were inquiring about while I was out, that room is on the fifth floor.</t496> <t497>The entrance to the staircase is in the small courtyard right next to the left here, - he pointed, - near the window of this tavern.</t497> <t498>But I remember now, one of you has already been there and can lead the way.</t498> <t499>Adieu, goodbye!</t499> <t500>The three others paid and left.</t500> <t501>While Mr. Defarge was intently watching his wife knit, the distinguished old man in the corner of the tavern approached and asked to speak privately.</t501>
<t502>− Willingly, sir, - Mr. Defarge agreed and quietly followed the old man out of the tavern.</t502>
<t503>The exchange was very brief and decisive.</t503> <t504>Almost upon hearing the first sentence, Mr. Defarge was startled and showed utmost attention.</t504> <t505>The conversation lasted less than a minute before he nodded and went outside.</t505>
<t506>The distinguished old man signaled to the girl, and both of them went out.</t506> <t507>Madame Defarge continued knitting with swift fingers, her eyebrows not moving, pretending not to see anything.</t507>
<t508>Mr. Jarvis Lorry and Miss Manette left the tavern, following Mr. Defarge to the entrance of the staircase that he had previously directed his customers to.</t508> <t509>The door was located in a dark, foul-smelling courtyard, serving as a common entrance for many houses, home to many people.</t509> <t510>At the dimly lit brick-paved entrance leading to the dimly lit brick-paved staircase, Mr. Defarge knelt on one knee before the daughter of his former master and lifted her hand to his lips to kiss.</t510> <t511>It was a gesture of kindness, but the manner of its expression did not appear so; in an instant, his demeanor had visibly changed.</t511> <t512>His face no longer bore a cheerful or open expression but had become one of secrecy, fury, and danger.</t512>
<t513>− It's way up high; a bit difficult to go up.</t513> <t514>So start slowly.</t514> <t515>- In a stern voice, Mr. Defarge said to Mr. Lorry as they climbed the stairs.</t515>
<t516>− He is alone? - Mr. Lorry whispered.</t516>
<t517>− Alone! Only God, who else would be with him! - Mr. Defarge also lowered his voice.</t517>
<t518>− So he's always alone? −</t518> <t519>Yes.</t519>
<t520>− Because he wants it that way? −</t520> <t521>Because he needs it that way.</t521> <t522>It's always like that, ever since I first met him, after they found me, asked me if I would take him in and keep it secret to avoid danger... he was like that then and he is still the same now.</t522>
<t523>− Has he changed a lot? −</t523> <t524>Changed! The innkeeper stopped, swung his arm, punched the wall, and let out a fierce curse.</t524> <t525>There could be no more emphatic answer than half of that curse.</t525> <t526>Mr. Lorry's mood grew heavier as he and the other two climbed higher and higher.</t526>
<t527>Such a staircase, along with its dependencies, in the more crowded and older areas of Paris, must have been worse compared to today; but even at that time, it was unpleasant for those who were not familiar and hardened.</t527> <t528>Every residence within the stinking nest that was this tall house, in other words, every room, apartment behind any door that opened onto this common staircase - left a pile of their garbage at the top of the stairs of each floor, along with throwing other waste out the window.</t528>
<t529>Even if it didn't carry the lingering smell of poverty, that heap of desperate decay and uncontrollable proliferation would have been enough to poison the entire atmosphere; but when both garbage and poverty join forces, the stench becomes unbearable.</t529> <t530>To move forward, one had to pass through that atmosphere, crossing the dark, steep, filthy, and noxious stairwell.</t530> <t531>Mr. Jarvis Lorry had to pause twice to catch his breath, exhausted by his own anxious thoughts and the restlessness of the young lady accompanying him.</t531> <t532>Each time he stopped at the miserable ventilation window, it seemed that any desirable fresh air had already escaped, and the foul, stinking vapors from outside had seeped in.</t532> <t533>Through the rusty bars of the ventilation window, one could almost taste rather than see this chaotic area; and within the range from here to the two tall towers of Notre-Dame Cathedral, nothing closer or lower promised a life of tranquility or lofty aspirations.</t533>
<t534>Finally, they reached the top of the staircase, and they stopped for the third time.</t534> <t535>They still had to climb another staircase, steeper and narrower, to reach the attic floor.</t535> <t536>The innkeeper always went a little ahead, staying close to Mr. Lorry, as if he was afraid the girl might ask any questions; here, he turned around, carefully rummaged through the pockets of the coat draped over his shoulder, and pulled out a key.</t536>
<t537>− Does this door need to be locked, my friend? - Mr. Lorry asked in surprise.</t537>
<t538>− Oh, yes, - Mr. Defarge's cruel reply.</t538>
<t539>− Do you think it is necessary to lock up this unfortunate person? −</t539> <t540>I think it is necessary to turn the key.</t540> <t541>- Mr. Defarge whispered close to his ear and frowned.</t541>
<t542>− Why? − Why, you ask? Because he has lived in captivity for so long that if you leave the door open now, he will panic, go mad, tear himself apart, die, or do any number of terrible things you can't predict.</t542>
<t543>− To that extent! - Mr. Lorry exclaimed.</t543>
<t544>− To that extent! - Defarge bitterly repeated. - Indeed.</t544> <t545>And what a wonderful world we live in when such things can still happen, and when many other similar things can happen, and not only can happen but have actually happened...</t545> <t546>Have happened, do you hear!...</t546> <t547>Under this sky, every day.</t547> <t548>Long live the devil.</t548> <t549>Let's move on.</t549>
<t550>The two people whispered, so no words reached the girl's ears.</t550> <t551>But by this time, she was trembling violently with strong emotion, her face showing extreme anxiety, and more than that, full of terror and horror, making Mr. Lorry feel obliged to say a few reassuring words.</t551>
<t552>− Be brave, miss! Be brave! It's just work!</t552> <t553>In just a moment, this terrible feeling will end; just pass through the door and this terrible feeling will be gone.</t553> <t554>After that, all the good things you bring to him, all the compensation, all the happiness you bring, will begin.</t554> <t555>Let our dear friend here support you on one side.</t555> <t556>That's right, my friend Defarge.</t556> <t557>Let's go! Work, work!</t557> <t558>They went up, slowly, gently, this staircase was short, and soon they reached the top.</t558> <t559>Upon arrival, just as they rounded the corner at the top of the stairs, they suddenly saw three people bending over, heads close together, on one side of the door, intently peering into the room through the cracks and holes in the wall.</t559> <t560>Hearing the approaching footsteps, all three turned around, stood up straight, and it turned out they were the same three men named Jacques who had been drinking in the tavern earlier.</t560>
<t561>− I forgot about them because you came by unexpectedly, - Mr. Defarge explained.</t561> <t562>- Go on, my friends; we have work to do here.</t562>
<t563>The three people squeezed past them and quietly went down.</t563>
<t564>On this floor, there didn't seem to be any other doors; the innkeeper went straight to that door after the three others had disappeared from sight. Mr. Lorry seemed angry and lowered his voice to ask Defarge: −</t564> <t565>− You let people look at Mr. Manette? −</t565> <t566>− I let a few selected people see him, as you have seen.</t566>
<t567>− Should we? −</t567> <t568>I think we should.</t568>
<t569>− Who are those few? How do you select them? −</t569> <t570>I choose the honest ones, those with the same name as mine... my name is Jacques... seeing him will be beneficial for them.</t570> <t571>That's enough; you are English, you wouldn't understand.</t571> <t572>Please stay there, wait a moment.</t572>
<t573>With a wave of his hand, he motioned them to step back, then he bent down to look through the gap in the wall.</t573> <t574>After that, he raised his head and knocked hard on the door two or three times - clearly with the sole purpose of making noise.</t574> <t575>With the same intention, he dragged the key across the door three or four times before clumsily inserting it into the lock and deliberately turning it with all his might.</t575>
<t576>The door slowly opened inward under Defarge's hand, he looked inside and said something.</t576> <t577>A vague voice answered something.</t577> <t578>Neither side said more than a single word.</t578>
<t579>He glanced over his shoulder and signaled for the other two to come in.</t579> <t580>Mr. Lorry wrapped his arm tightly around the girl's waist because he feared she might collapse.</t580>
<t581>− Ah, work, just work! - He urged, but the sparkling tear on his cheek had nothing to do with work.</t581> <t582>- Come in, come in! −</t582> <t583>I'm afraid of this, - the girl replied, trembling.</t583>
<t584>− This? What? − I mean that person.</t584> <t585>It's my father.</t585>
<t586>Frenzied by the girl's distress and the guide's beckoning gesture, Mr. Lorry pulled her arm around his neck, slightly lifted her, and quickly drew her into the room.</t586> <t587>He set her down just inside the threshold and kept her close to him.</t587>
<t588>Defarge took out the key, closed the door, locked it from the inside, and then took the key out and held it in his hand.</t588> <t589>Every action was careful and deliberately made loud and noisy.</t589> <t590>Finally, he crossed the room, his steps cautious, and went to the window.</t590> <t591>He stopped there and turned to face the room.</t591>
<t592>Once used as a storage for firewood and similar items, this attic room was dim and dark; because that dormer window was actually an opening to the roof, equipped with a small crane to pull goods up from the street; it had no glass panes but consisted of two shutters folding in the middle like all French-style doors. To avoid the cold, one shutter was tightly closed, and the other was only slightly ajar.</t592> <t593>Through that narrow gap, very little light came in, making the room pitch dark, and it was very difficult to see anything upon first entering; one had to stay for a long time to gradually get used to it and be able to do any meticulous work in such darkness.</t593> <t594>Yet, such meticulous work was being done right in this attic room.</t594> <t595>With his back to the room door and facing the window where the innkeeper was standing and looking, a white-haired man sat on a low bench, bent forward, busy making shoes.</t595>
<t596>6.</t596> <t597>The Shoemaker</t597>
<t598>− Hello! - Mr. Defarge said while looking down at the silver-haired head bent over making shoes.</t598>
<t599>The head lifted slightly and responded to the greeting with a very soft voice, as if it came from afar: −</t599> <t600>Hello! − Are you still working hard?</t600> <t601>After a long silence, the head lifted again and that voice replied: − Yes... I am working.</t601> <t602>This time, a pair of vacant eyes looked at the questioner before the face dropped again.</t602>
<t603>That feeble voice was both pitiable and frightening.</t603> <t604>It was not the frailty of a physically exhausted body, although certainly, the captivity and harsh treatment had contributed.</t604> <t605>The pitiable aspect was due to the voice having long been unused in solitude.</t605> <t606>The reply sounded like the dying echo of a sound that had faded long ago.</t606> <t607>The voice had lost all vitality and resonance of human speech to the extent that it was no different from a once beautiful color now faded into a pathetic, blurry stain.</t607> <t608>The voice was deep and muffled, as if it were rising from the depths of the earth.</t608> <t609>The voice of a lost and despairing person, so sorrowful that one might think a starving, exhausted wanderer, isolated in the wilderness, would utter such a mournful sound of longing for home and friends before collapsing in death.</t609>
<t610>A few minutes of silent work passed, and the vacant eyes looked up again, not out of attention or curiosity, but merely a vague mechanical sense in front of them, at the spot where those eyes knew the sole guest had stood, and now still wasn't empty.</t610>
<t611>− I want to open the door a bit more to let in more light, - Defarge, who had not taken his eyes off the shoemaker, said.</t611> <t612>- Can you endure it a bit longer?</t612> <t613>The shoemaker paused; his eyes looked down at the floor beside him as if he hadn't heard anything, then looked at the floor on the other side, and finally looked up at the speaker.</t613>
<t614>− What did you just say? −</t614> <t615>Can you bear a bit more light? −</t615> <t616>I have to, if you want.</t616> <t617>- The shoemaker's voice vaguely emphasized the second word.</t617>
<t618>The slightly ajar door was pushed open a bit more and temporarily secured at that angle.</t618> <t619>A broad beam of light shone into the attic room, revealing that the craftsman had stopped his work, with an unfinished shoe resting on his lap.</t619> <t620>At his feet and on the bench were some common tools and pieces of leather of various sizes.</t620> <t621>He had a white, scraggly beard, not very long, a deeply sunken face, and strangely bright eyes.</t621> <t622>His haggard, emaciated face made his eyes appear larger beneath still-black eyebrows and disheveled white hair, although in reality, they were not; but his already large eyes now seemed unusually large.</t622> <t623>His tattered yellow shirt, open at the collar, exposed a wrinkled, wasted body.</t623> <t624>Both he, his old canvas cloak, his sagging socks, and all his tattered, ragged clothes had not been exposed to sunlight and fresh air for so long that everything had turned the same dry yellow color, making it hard to distinguish between the man and his clothing.</t624>
<t625>He raised a hand to shield his eyes from the light, which seemed to penetrate even through the bones.</t625> <t626>Stopping his work, he sat there with a blank, vacant stare.</t626> <t627>He neither looked at the figure in front of him nor glanced to his side first before looking up at the other person, as if he had lost the habit of associating position with sound; he did not speak without first searching for the source of the voice, and then forgot to utter a word.</t627>
<t628>− Did you finish those shoes today? - Defarge asked while signaling Mr. Lorry to come over.</t628>
<t629>− What did you just say? −</t629> <t630>Are you planning to finish the pair of shoes today? −</t630> <t631>I don't know if I can finish them.</t631> <t632>Probably will finish.</t632> <t633>Can't say for sure.</t633>
<t634>But that question reminded the worker of his job, and he bent down to continue working.</t634>
<t635>Mr. Lorry quietly walked in, leaving the girl standing at the doorway.</t635> <t636>As Mr. Lorry stood for about one or two minutes beside Defarge, the shoemaker looked up.</t636> <t637>He did not show any sign of surprise at seeing another person, but while looking at the newcomer, one of his hands brought trembling fingers to his lips (both the lips and the fingernails were the same leaden gray color), and then the hand went back to his work, once again bending over the shoe.</t637> <t638>The glance and the movement happened swiftly.</t638>
<t639>− You have a visitor, - Mr. Defarge said.</t639>
<t640>− What did you just say? −</t640> <t641>There is a guest coming to visit.</t641>
<t642>The shoemaker looked up as before, but his hands did not stop working.</t642>
<t643>− Hey! - Defarge said.</t643> <t644>- This gentleman here can tell just by looking at the shoe whether it's well-made or not.</t644> <t645>Show him the shoe you're working on.</t645> <t646>Here it is, sir.</t646>
<t647>Mr. Lorry reached out to take the shoe.</t647>
<t648>− Please let this gentleman know what style these shoes are and who made them.</t648>
<t649>After a longer-than-usual silence, the shoemaker finally replied: − I forgot what you asked.</t649> <t650>What did you just say? −</t650> <t651>I asked if you could tell this gentleman the style of the shoe? −</t651> <t652>This is a woman's shoe.</t652> <t653>A walking shoe for a young lady.</t653> <t654>It's the current trend.</t654> <t655>I've never seen this fashion before.</t655> <t656>I made it based on an existing model.</t656> <t657>- He looked at the shoe, his face showing a hint of pride.</t657>
<t658>− Which cobbler made these shoes? - Defarge said.</t658>
<t659>Now with nothing left to do, he kept threading the fingers of his right hand into the palm of his left hand, then threading the fingers of his left hand into the palm of his right hand, then bringing one hand up to his chin to stroke his beard. These actions repeated incessantly in that exact sequence.</t659> <t660>Every time he spoke, his mind wandered; reminding him was akin to rousing a fainted person or trying to sustain the life of someone on the brink of death in hopes of extracting some revelation.</t660>
<t661>− Are you asking my name? −</t661> <t662>That's right.</t662>
<t663>− One Hundred and Five, North Tower.</t663>
<t664>− Is that all? − One Hundred and Five, North Tower.</t664>
<t665>Letting out a sound that was neither a sigh nor a groan, he bent over to work again until the silence was once more broken.</t665>
<t666>− You are not a professional shoemaker, are you? - Mr. Lorry asked while staring intently at the shoemaker.</t666>
<t667>His weary eyes turned towards Defarge as if wanting to transfer the question to him; but receiving no help from that direction, his eyes searched the ground for an answer before looking up at the questioner.</t667>
<t668>− I'm not a professional shoemaker?</t668> <t669>Yes, I'm not a professional shoemaker.</t669> <t670>I... I learned the trade here.</t670> <t671>I taught myself.</t671> <t672>I asked for permission...</t672>
<t673>He was again lost in thought for several minutes, his hands constantly twisting together as if rummaging through that span of time.</t673> <t674>Finally, his gaze slowly turned towards the face he had lost; fixing on it when found, he continued to answer like someone who had just woken up and wanted to return to the unfinished conversation from the night before: −</t674> <t675>I had asked for permission to study on my own, and it was very difficult, it took a long time, but I was finally granted permission, and I have been making shoes ever since.</t675>
<t676>As the shoemaker reached out to take back the shoe, Mr. Lorry said, his eyes still fixed on the face of the person opposite: "Dr. Manette, do you not remember anything about me?"</t676> <t677>The shoe fell to the ground, and the shoemaker sat staring intently at the questioner.</t677>
<t678>− Mr. Manette, - Mr. Lorry grasped Defarge's arm, - do you not remember anything about this person?</t678> <t679>Look at him. Look at me.</t679> <t680>Does your mind not recall anything about the old banker, the old work, the old servant, the old times, Mr. Manette?</t680> <t681>While the man who had been imprisoned for so many years stared intently, shifting his gaze from Lorry to Defarge, the traces of clear recognition that had long been erased from his forehead now slowly struggled to tear through the dark clouds shrouding his memory.</t681> <t682>The signs of recognition were covered, faded, appearing and lingering.</t682> <t683>And that very same expression was repeated on the forehead of the beautiful girl who had been stealthily making her way along the wall to a spot where she could see the shoemaker.</t683> <t684>She stood there, her hands initially raised in fear, as if to ward off the other person from her sight, now reaching out, trembling with the desire to embrace that ghostly face, to bring life and hope to him with her love.</t684> <t685>More clearly imprinted, the expression on the girl's forehead was the same as that of the shoemaker, as if it had been transmitted like a beam of light from him to her.</t685>
<t686>The darkness once again covered the worker's forehead.</t686> <t687>He looked at the two men in front of him, becoming more and more distracted, then his gloomy eyes wandered around the floor as before.</t687> <t688>Finally, with a long sigh, he picked up the shoe and continued his work.</t688>
<t689>− Do you recognize him? - Defarge whispered.</t689>
<t690>− Yes, just for a moment.</t690> <t691>At first, I thought it was hopeless, but clearly, in just a fleeting moment, I recognized the face that had once been so familiar to me.</t691> <t692>Shh! Let's move back a bit further.</t692> <t693>Shh! The girl had moved from the wall of the attic room to very close to the shoemaker's bench.</t693> <t694>It was truly frightening; he kept bending over his work, completely unaware of the presence of someone so close that they could touch him by simply reaching out.</t694>
<t695>Not a word; not a sound.</t695> <t696>She stood still like a ghost beside him, while he remained bent over the shoe.</t696>
<t697>After a very long time, he finally put down the tool in his hand to pick up the skinning knife.</t697> <t698>The knife was lying on the far side from where the girl stood.</t698> <t699>He picked up the knife, bent down to work again, and his eyes caught the hem of her dress.</t699>
<t700>He looked up and saw the girl.</t700> <t701>The two others started to step forward, but she gestured to stop them.</t701> <t702>They were afraid the shoemaker might use the knife to harm the girl, but she was not.</t702>
<t703>He looked at Manette with a fearful gaze, and after a moment, his lips moved but no words came out.</t703> <t704>Then slowly, amidst heavy, rapid breaths, a sentence emerged word by word: −</t704> <t705>What is this?</t705> <t706>Tears streaming down her cheeks, the girl raised her hands to her lips to send the shoemaker a kiss, then clasped her hands over her chest as if cradling his sorrowful head.</t706>
<t707>− Aren't you the daughter of the jailer? −</t707> <t708>No, - the girl sighed.</t708>
<t709>− Who are you? Not trusting her own voice, she sat down on the bench next to him.</t709> <t710>The shoemaker retreated but she had grabbed his arm.</t710>
<t711>As soon as her hand touched him, a strange shiver clearly spread throughout his body; the shoemaker gently put the knife down, his eyes never leaving the girl.</t711>
<t712>Manette's golden curls were hastily tossed to the sides and flowed down around her neck.</t712> <t713>The shoemaker's hand inched closer to her, lifting a lock of hair to look at it.</t713> <t714>His mind suddenly wandered again, he sighed once more, then bent over the shoe he was working on.</t714>
<t715>But not for long.</t715> <t716>Releasing the shoemaker's arm, the girl placed her hand on his shoulder.</t716> <t717>After two or three times looking at that hand full of suspicion as if to make sure it was really there, he put his work down again, raised his hand to his neck, and removed a darkened string with a small, tattered piece of cloth tied to it.</t717> <t718>The shoemaker placed the cloth bundle on his knee, carefully opened it, and inside was a small amount of hair, just a few long golden strands that he had long ago wrapped around his finger.</t718>
<t719>He lifted a lock of her hair and examined it closely.</t719>
<t720>− Exactly the same. How can that be! Since when! How is that possible! When the wrinkles of thought appeared on the shoemaker's forehead, he seemed to notice that the girl's forehead had the same expression.</t720>
<t721>He turned her fully towards the light to look at her.</t721>
<t722>− She rested her head on my shoulder that night when I was summoned...</t722> <t723>she feared this departure, even though I did not... and when I was taken to the North Tower, people saw these few strands of hair on my sleeve.</t723> <t724>“Will you leave them with me? These strands of hair cannot help me escape physically, though they might free my spirit.” Those were the words I said.</t724> <t725>I still remember it very clearly.</t725>
<t726>His lips moved for a long time before he could speak.</t726> <t727>But when he did speak, he was very articulate, though slow.</t727>
<t728>− How can that be?...</t728> <t729>Is that her? Once again, Mr. Lorry and Defarge were startled when the shoemaker suddenly turned to look at the girl, so abruptly that it was frightening.</t729> <t730>But while he held her tightly, Manette remained very still and softly said: −</t730> <t731>Please, sirs, please, do not come near us, do not speak, do not move.</t731>
<t732>− Listen! - He exclaimed. - Whose voice is that?</t732> <t733>Along with the shout, his hands released the girl and frantically tore at his own gray hair.</t733> <t734>This outburst too would pass, like so many things that had faded from his mind except for shoemaking. He folded the small cloth bundle and tried to tie it around his neck as before, but he still kept his eyes fixed on the girl and shook his head sadly.</t734>
<t735>− No, no, no; you are too young, too fresh.</t735> <t736>It cannot be her.</t736> <t737>Look at the appearance of this prisoner.</t737> <t738>This is not the familiar hand, this is not the familiar face, this is not the voice she used to hear.</t738> <t739>No, no.</t739> <t740>She is... and he is...</t740> <t741>before going through so many long years in the North Tower... a long time ago.</t741> <t742>What is your name, oh gentle angel? Seeing the shoemaker's tone had softened, his daughter knelt before him, placing her pleading hands on his chest.</t742>
<t743>− Oh, dear sir.</t743> <t744>There will come a time when you will know my name, know who my mother is, know who my father is, and understand why I am familiar with the harsh and painful story of my parents.</t744> <t745>But right now, I cannot tell you, and I cannot say it here.</t745> <t746>At this moment, all I can ask is for you to hold me, bless me.</t746> <t747>Kiss me, kiss me!</t747> <t748>Oh, dear sir, dear sir! Your cold silver hair mingles with the golden hair of the young girl, the youthful head warming and illuminating the old head as if the light of Freedom is shining upon it.</t748>
<t749>− If you hear my voice... I don't know if it's right, but I hope so... if you hear my voice like that of someone who was once melodious music to your ears, then please weep, please weep! If you stroke, stroke my hair, and remember a beloved head that once leaned on your chest in the free days of youth, then please weep, please weep! If I tell you that a family is waiting for us, where I will wholeheartedly fulfill my duty to take care of you, if I make you remember a family that has long been lonely while your heart has been yearning, then please weep, please weep!</t749> <t750>The girl hugged the shoemaker tightly around the neck and rocked him like a baby.</t750>
<t751>− Oh, my dear, if I tell you that your suffering has ended, that I have come here to dispel your pain, that we will go to England to live in peace, if I make you remember the precious life that was taken away, remember the cruel homeland of France, then please cry, please cry!</t751> <t752>And if ever I tell you my name, the name of my living father, the name of my deceased mother, you will understand that I must kneel before that revered father to ask for forgiveness because I did not search for him daily, nor did I mourn him nightly, because my poor mother, out of love for me, kept my father's suffering a secret, then please cry, please cry! Cry for that mother, and for me too! Oh, my dear, thank God! I have seen your sacred tears fall upon my face, and your sobs echo in my heart.</t752> <t753>Oh, look!</t753> <t754>Thank our Lord, thank God! He has collapsed into the girl's embrace, his head resting on her chest - a touching yet terrifying scene due to the extreme injustice and suffering that had occurred before, causing the two men witnessing it to cover their faces, unable to look.</t754>
<t755>When the attic room had been silent for a long time and the sobbing breaths and trembling body of the shoemaker had sunk into stillness - the calm after every storm; a symbol of humanity, of the remaining peace after the storms of life have passed - it was then that Mr. Lorry and Defarge came to help the father and daughter to their feet.</t755> <t756>The shoemaker had slowly collapsed to the floor and lay exhausted in a faint.</t756> <t757>The girl had sunk down with him, her arm cradling the shoemaker's head; her hair spread over her father's face like a curtain shielding the source of light.</t757>
<t758>− If we do not startle him, - she said while extending her hand to Mr. Lorry as he, after a few sniffles, was bending down to lift the father and daughter up, - we can arrange everything to leave Paris immediately, taking him away from here at once...</t758>
<t759>− But think about it.</t759> <t760>Does he have the strength to travel long distances?</t760> <t761>Mr. Lorry asked.</t761>
<t762>− I think it's better than having to stay in this city, which is too terrible for him.</t762>
<t763>− That's right, - Defarge said, he was kneeling on the floor looking at everyone and listening to the story.</t763> <t764>- Most importantly, Mr. Manette will be safer if he leaves France. So should I go hire a carriage? −</t764> <t765>That's business, - Mr. Lorry returned to his usual professional demeanor, - and if it's business, it must be done, so I'd better do it.</t765>
<t766>− Then please let us stay here, - Miss Manette urged.</t766> <t767>- You see how calm my father is now, I will be fine staying here, sir.</t767> <t768>Why are you so worried? If you lock the door so no one can disturb us, I am sure that when you return, my father will still be as calm as before.</t768> <t769>Anyway, I will be here to take care of my father while you are gone, and when you return, we can immediately take him away from here.</t769>
<t770>Neither Mr. Lorry nor Defarge were satisfied with this and wanted one of them to stay.</t770> <t771>But it wasn't just a matter of horses and carriages, there were also travel documents to worry about; and as time was running out because the day was nearly over, they ultimately had to hastily divide the necessary tasks and hurriedly set off.</t771>
<t772>So, as the sky gradually darkened, the daughter lay her head on the hard ground beside her father, keeping watch.</t772> <t773>The darkness grew deeper and deeper, the father and daughter lay still until a light flashed through the cracked walls.</t773>
<t774>Mr. Lorry and Defarge had arranged everything for the trip, and besides cloaks and warm traveling clothes, they also brought bread, meat, wine, and hot coffee.</t774> <t775>Defarge placed all these necessary items and the lamp he was holding onto the shoemaker's bench (in the attic room which had no other furniture except for a rickety bed).</t775> <t776>Then he and Mr. Lorry woke the prisoner up and helped him stand.</t776>
<t777>Seeing the bewildered, dazed, and fearful expression on the shoemaker's face, no intellect could comprehend the mysteries within his mind.</t777>
<t778>No one could answer the question of whether he understood what was happening, whether he remembered what he had heard, or whether he knew he had been set free.</t778> <t779>They tried to start a conversation, but he was so bewildered and responded so slowly that everyone became worried and agreed to leave him alone for the time being.</t779> <t780>Every now and then, he would raise his hands to his head in a manner so foolish and senseless that it had never been seen before; yet, just hearing Miss Manette's voice seemed to bring him some pleasure, and he would always turn to listen.</t780>
<t781>Having grown accustomed to submitting to compulsion, he did whatever he was told, if told to eat and drink, he ate and drank, if told to wear a cloak or warm clothes, he wore them.</t781> <t782>He obediently let Manette take his arm, and he held the child's hand with both of his old hands.</t782>
<t783>They began to descend the stairs; Mr. Defarge led the way with a lantern, and Mr. Lorry followed at the rear.</t783> <t784>After only a few steps down the main staircase, the shoemaker stopped, staring intently at the ceiling and around the walls.</t784>
<t785>− Do you remember that place, father? Do you remember going up there? −</t785> <t786>What did you just say?</t786> <t787>But before Manette could repeat the question, he answered as if repeating her words: −</t787> <t788>Remember what? No, I don't remember.</t788> <t789>It's been too long.</t789>
<t790>Everyone could clearly see that he did not remember being taken from the prison to this house.</t790> <t791>They heard him mumble "One Hundred and Five, North Tower," and when he looked around, it was obvious that he was searching for the walls that had imprisoned him for so long.</t791> <t792>When he reached the courtyard, he unconsciously changed his pace, as if about to step onto a drawbridge, but there was no drawbridge here, and upon seeing the carriage waiting on the road, he let go of his daughter's hand and started to pull at his hair again.</t792>
<t793>There was no one gathered in front of the door; no shadow flickering behind the windows; the streets were completely deserted without a single passerby.</t793> <t794>An unusual silence and desolation reigned.</t794> <t795>There was only one person, Mrs. Defarge - standing by the door, knitting and seeing nothing at all.</t795>
<t796>The prisoner climbed into the carriage, his daughter followed, and Mr. Lorry was just placing his foot on the step when the poor man pleaded to bring along his shoemaker's bench and the unfinished shoes. Madame Defarge immediately told her husband to let her fetch them, and she left the light, crossed the yard, her hands never ceasing to knit.</t796> <t797>She quickly brought those items down and handed them to them; then immediately returned to the doorway, her hands still knitting, her eyes seeing nothing.</t797>
<t798>Defarge climbed onto the coachman's seat and shouted, "To the city gate!"</t798> <t799>The driver cracked his whip and everyone clattered along the road under the dim, swaying lights above.</t799>
<t800>Passing through the swaying street lamps above - brighter in the wealthy streets, and dimmer in the poorer streets - passing through the illuminated shops, bustling crowds, brightly lit cafes, and theaters, the carriage arrived at a city gate.</t800> <t801>There was a guard post there and soldiers holding lanterns in their hands.</t801>
<t802>− Where is your pass, traveler? −</t802> <t803>Sir, here it is, - Defarge said as he got off the carriage and pulled the guard aside, - these are the papers of the gentleman in the carriage, the one with the silver hair.</t803> <t804>They entrusted the papers to me, along with the other person, at the place... - He lowered his voice, the military lanterns swayed, and a uniformed arm extended one into the carriage, the eyes of the soldier holding the lantern scrutinizing the silver-haired head with an unusual intensity.</t804>
<t805>− Alright.</t805> <t806>Go! - The guard exclaimed.</t806>
<t807>− Goodbye! Farewell! - Defarge replied.</t807> <t808>And so, passing under a row of swaying lanterns that grew dimmer and dimmer, the carriage moved out into the desolate countryside where only the starlight illuminated the way.</t808>
<t809>Under that immobile and eternal dome of light, there are stars so far from this tiny Earth that even the learned dare not be sure they see the starlight, a void filled with all the painful past - the shadows of the vast and dark night.</t809> <t810>Throughout the long, cold, restless night, Mr. Jarvis Lorry sat before the newly unearthed person who had been buried, constantly wondering what delicate abilities the person opposite had permanently lost and what could be restored, while the shadows incessantly whispered the old question in his ear: −</t810> <t811>Do you still wish to live again?</t811> <t812>And the same old answer: −</t812> <t813>It's hard to say.</t813>
<t814>Part Two THE GOLDEN THREAD</t814>
<t815>1.</t815> <t816>Five years later</t816>
<t817>The Tellson Bank near Temple Bar gate was an old-fashioned place, even back in 1780.</t817> <t818>This place was very small, very dark, very ugly, and very cramped.</t818> <t819>Moreover, it became even more old-fashioned as the shareholders running the bank took pride in its darkness, ugliness, and cramped inconvenience.</t819> <t820>They were even proud of all these characteristics and harbored a special conviction that if the place were not so unappealing, it would lose some of its respectability.</t820> <t821>This was not a negative belief at all but rather a positive weapon for them to flaunt against more comfortable businesses, claiming that Tellson did not need spaciousness, Tellson did not need brightness, Tellson did not need decoration.</t821>
<t822>Noakes and the Brotherhood might need it, or perhaps the Snooks Brothers might need it, but Tellson does not, thank God! The heir of any shareholder would be disinherited if they dared to suggest renovating Tellson.</t822> <t823>In this regard, Tellson's is quite similar to England, a country that very often strips the freedom of any citizen who dares to propose reforming long-standing customs that only increase reverence but are extremely reprehensible.</t823>
<t824>That's why Tellson became the pinnacle of inconvenience.</t824> <t825>After pushing open the stubborn, foolish door that always creaked and groaned, I immediately stumbled upon two steps leading down, and upon regaining my composure, I realized I was in a miserably cramped place, with two small counters where old men with trembling hands held my check and scrutinized the signature through dim windows, perpetually smeared with mud splashed from Fleet Street, and further darkened by the iron bars on the window frames and the gloomy shadow of the Temple Bar gate. If my business required me to meet the "Boss," I would be taken to something resembling a solitary confinement cell at the back, where I could reflect on my wasted life while waiting for the Boss, hands in pockets, to appear, inevitably startling me in that twilight gloom.</t825>
<t826>My money jumps out or flies into the old, termite-ridden wooden drawers, a cloud of dust will rush up my nose, crawl into my throat when these drawers are pulled out and slammed shut.</t826> <t827>My banknotes have a musty smell as if they will quickly rot back into rags*.</t827> <t828>My gold and silver items are placed in those filthy compartments, and the polish will be destroyed in just one or two days by all the filth inside.</t828> <t829>My property documents are stored in makeshift vaults that used to be kitchens and sculleries, and the papers will be eroded in the atmosphere of this bank.</t829> <t830>My family document chests are taken upstairs to the Barmecide room*, which always has a grand banquet table but never any food; where the first letters from an old lover or from my young children, dating back to 1780, have just escaped the horror of being spied on through the windows, because the Temple Bar gate used to display the heads of executed people - an act of barbarity and extreme cruelty that one would think only happened in ancient times in Abyssinia or Ashanti*.</t830>
<t831>But in reality, at that time, capital punishment was a prevalent solution in all professions, especially with Tellson's Bank.</t831> <t832>If death was nature's cure-all, why shouldn't the law apply it? Accordingly, anyone who forged documents was sentenced to death; anyone who wrote a bad check was sentenced to death; anyone who secretly opened and read someone else's letter was sentenced to death; anyone who stole forty shillings and sixpence was sentenced to death; anyone who kept a horse in front of Tellson's Bank and stole one to ride away was sentenced to death; anyone who counterfeited a single shilling was sentenced to death; just a minor misstep in the entire spectrum of money-related crimes could lead to execution.</t832> <t833>And with so many executions, it didn't have any deterrent effect—in fact, the opposite was true—but like everything in life, executing people was less troublesome than dealing with each case individually and worrying about the consequences later.</t833> <t834>Therefore, at that time, like other larger businesses of the era, Tellson's Bank had taken so many lives that if the severed heads—if not secretly disposed of—were piled up at the Temple Bar gate, the number of heads would almost block any sunlight from reaching the ground floor of that place.</t834>
<t835>Stuffed in all sorts of compartments, the dingy cages at Tellson were where the oldest and most solemn people did everything.</t835> <t836>If they took a young person into the London branch of Tellson, they would hide him somewhere until he grew old.</t836> <t837>They would lock him in a dark place, like aging cheese, until he turned moldy and reeked of Tellson.</t837> <t838>Only then would he be allowed to show his face, to scrutinize the large ledgers, and to display his breeches and gaiters, adding to the bank's solemnity.</t838>
<t839>Sitting outside Tellson's was the living sign of this bank; it was an errand boy - never allowed inside without orders - occasionally doubling as a porter and messenger.</t839> <t840>He was never absent during working hours, unless he had to go on an errand, and if he did, he was replaced by his son: a ghastly twelve-year-old urchin who looked exactly like his father.</t840> <t841>Everyone understood that Tellson had condescended to accept that errand boy.</t841> <t842>The bank had always accepted someone for such a job, and time and fate had brought this man to that position.</t842> <t843>His surname was Cruncher, and having promised to renounce dark deeds during his baptism at the parish church of Hounsditch in East London, he was given the additional name Jerry.</t843>
<t844>It is now the scene of Cruncher's private house in Hanging Sword Alley, Whitefriars Street, at half-past seven on a windy March morning in the year</t844>
<t845>1780 AD. (Instead of referring to the year AD in Latin as</t845>
<t846>“Anno Domini”, Cruncher always called it “Anna Dominoes”, clearly mistaking the year of the Lord's birth for the year the popular game invented by some lady named Dominoes was created.) The Cruncher household was not located in a clean and fragrant place and had only two rooms, if one considered the small room with a single glass window as a room.</t846> <t847>But every room was tidied up properly.</t847> <t848>At this early hour in the windy March morning, the room he was sleeping in had been scrubbed spotless; on the large pine wood table, a pristine white cloth had been laid out and cups and saucers were set up for breakfast.</t848>
<t849>Cruncher lay under a patchwork quilt of many colors, looking like a gaudy clown.</t849> <t850>He was deep in sleep but gradually began to toss and turn in bed until he woke up, his disheveled hair seeming to want to tear the quilt into pieces.</t850> <t851>He sat up, shouting in a very annoyed voice: −</t851> <t852>I'm doomed, she does this every day! Kneeling in the corner of the room, a diligent-looking woman, neatly dressed, stood up rather hastily and fearfully, clearly indicating she was the one being referred to.</t852>
<t853>− What? - Cruncher said while looking around the bed for his boot.</t853> <t854>Is she like this every day?</t854> <t855>After the second greeting, he greeted a third time by throwing the boot at the woman.</t855> <t856>The boot was covered in mud, and that was a sign indicating a strange detail related to Cruncher's household economy: while he usually came home from the bank after work with clean boots, in the morning he often woke up with those same boots covered in clay.</t856>
<t857>− What? - Cruncher changed his tone after missing the throw.</t857> <t858>- You troublemaker, what are you doing? −</t858> <t859>I'm just praying.</t859>
<t860>− Pray and wish!</t860> <t861>You're something else! Are you planning to sit there and curse me? −</t861> <t862>I'm not cursing, I'm just praying for good things for you.</t862>
<t863>− That's it! If it's not like that, don't blame me for being unreasonable.</t863> <t864>Hey, Jerry, your mother is something else, always cursing and not letting your father make a living.</t864> <t865>You have a mother who loves your father too much, see that, kid.</t865> <t866>You have a devout mother, see that, kid, always sitting down and praying for people to snatch the food out of her only child's mouth.</t866>
<t867>Little Cruncher (still in his pajamas) was annoyed upon hearing this and turned to his mother, vehemently opposing anything that would reduce his share of food.</t867>
<t868>− You think you're so great, - continued Cruncher Sr., speaking out of turn, - how much are your prayers worth?</t868> <t869>How much are they worth, tell me! −</t869> <t870>They are worth only the sincerity of my heart, Jerry. That's all.</t870>
<t871>− With a barrel! - Cruncher repeated. - Then it's not worth much.</t871> <t872>Expensive or not, you can't curse me, I'm telling you.</t872> <t873>I forbid it.</t873> <t874>Don't bring me bad luck with your button-pressing tricks.</t874> <t875>If you have to pray, pray for your husband and child, don't curse.</t875> <t876>If I didn't have such a contrary wife, if my child didn't have such a contrary mother, I would have made some money last week instead of being cursed, sabotaged, and plagued with bad luck. I'm doomed! - Cruncher said continuously while changing clothes.</t876> <t877>- Praying so hard and ruining everything, if only last week an honest worker like me hadn't been caught in this terrible bad luck! Jerry, change your clothes, while I'm polishing my boots, keep an eye on your mother, if you see her slump down again, call me.</t877> <t878>Hey, I'm telling you, - Cruncher turned to his wife again, - at this rate, I'm not going anymore.</t878> <t879>I'm exhausted, sleepy to death, my back hurts so much I can't feel anything; working for nothing; I suspect you've been cursing me day and night so I can't make any money, I won't let this go, you troublemaker, what do you want now?</t879> <t880>Mumbling things like “Sure! So pious!”</t880> <t881>You wouldn't curse your poor husband and child, would you?</t881> <t882>I know you too well!” and sharpening his resentment into scathing sarcasm, Cruncher started polishing his boots and preparing his things for work.</t882> <t883>Meanwhile, the son - with hair still soft but already spiky, eyes close together just like his father's - kept an eye on his mother as instructed.</t883>
<t884>In the room, while washing his face and changing clothes, he would occasionally rush out to bother his poor mother by pretending to shout, "Mom's about to plop down..."</t884>
<t885>"Look, Dad!" and after that fake alarm, it rushed back into the room, grinning mischievously.</t885>
<t886>Cruncher was still upset when he sat down for breakfast.</t886> <t887>He became furious and spoke resentfully when his wife said her prayers.</t887>
<t888>− There, you troublemaker! What are you planning to do now?</t888> <t889>Are you cursing?</t889> <t890>Cruncher's wife explained that she was just "asking for blessings." − No need! - Cruncher said while looking around as if he expected to see his wife's prayer make the loaf of bread disappear.</t890> <t891>I don't need to ask for blessings to disappear from this house, this family.</t891> <t892>I don't need to ask for blessings to make my food disappear from this table.</t892> <t893>Shut up! With bloodshot eyes as if he had stayed up all night partying but ended up having no fun, Jerry Cruncher worried about breakfast rather than eating it, growling over his meal like a wild beast in a cage.</t893> <t894>By around nine o'clock, he smoothed out his scowl, then donned a respectable and proper appearance to cover his true nature, and left the house to start a day's work.</t894>
<t895>Even though Cruncher liked to call himself a "respectable businessman," it was hard to consider his work a profession.</t895> <t896>His tools consisted of only a wooden stool, sawed from a broken-backed chair, which young Jerry, walking beside his father every morning, would carry to place under the bank window closest to the Temple Bar gate; there, the stool was supplemented with a handful of straw taken from the first passing carriage to spread on the ground to keep his feet from getting cold and wet, thus becoming the errand man's headquarters.</t896> <t897>In this position, Cruncher had become as familiar to everyone on Fleet Street and in the Temple Bar area as the gate itself.</t897>
<t898>At the barracks at a quarter to nine, just in time to raise his tricorn hat to salute the oldest Tellson employees entering the bank, Jerry Cruncher sat on duty on that windy March morning with little Jerry standing beside him, if the boy wasn't busy scouring Temple Bar for younger boys to show his affection by inflicting some physical or mental injuries.</t898> <t899>Identical in appearance, the father and son silently watched the morning traffic on Fleet Street, their heads close together like two eyes on each person's face; they looked just like two monkeys.</t899> <t900>They looked even more like monkeys when, from time to time, father Jerry chewed and spat out a straw while little Jerry's blinking eyes restlessly observed both his father and everything else on Fleet Street.</t900>
<t901>The head of the messenger who worked permanently inside Tellson's Bank stuck out of the main door, and a curt word was uttered: −</t901> <t902>Need an errand! −</t902> <t903>A ha, there you are, Dad! Got work early today!</t903> <t904>After that farewell, young Jerry sat on his father's stool, focusing on the straw his father left behind, chewing it while pondering.</t904>
<t905>− There's always a smell of rust!</t905> <t906>Father's fingers are always covered in rust.</t906> <t907>- Jerry mumbled.</t907> <t908>- Where does my father get this rusty smell from? There's nothing rusty around here!</t908>
<t909>2.</t909> <t910>Curiosity</t910>
<t911>− You know the Old Bailey courthouse, right? You know it, don't you? - One of the oldest clerks asked the messenger Jerry.</t911>
<t912>− Yes, I know, - Jerry replied, his voice sounding somewhat grumpy, - I know the court.</t912>
<t913>− Good.</t913> <t914>And you know Mr. Lorry? −</t914> <t915>I know Mr. Lorry, yes, even better than I know the court.</t915> <t916>- Jerry spoke as if he were an unwilling witness in a courtroom. - Even better than what an honest businessman like me would want to know about the court.</t916>
<t917>− Very well.</t917> <t918>Go to the witness entrance of the court, then give this letter to the doorman to pass on to Mr. Lorry. After that, he will let you in.</t918>
<t919>− Go inside the building? −</t919> <t920>Go inside the building right away.</t920>
<t921>Cruncher's two eyes seemed to move closer together, and they were asking each other, "What do you think about this?"</t921> <t922>After the two eyes finished conferring, Cruncher asked, "So I have to wait inside the court?"</t922> <t923>“Let me make it clear to you.”</t923> <t924>“The gatekeeper will deliver the letter to Mr. Lorry, and you will signal something to Mr. Lorry to get his attention and let him know where you are standing.”</t924> <t925>“What you need to do after that is just stand there until he needs you.”</t925>
<t926>− Is that all? − That's all.</t926> <t927>He needs someone to be on standby for communication.</t927> <t928>This letter is to inform him that you are there.</t928>
<t929>While the old clerk meticulously folded the letter and wrote the recipient's name on it, Cruncher silently observed until the old man dried the ink before speaking: −</t929> <t930>I guess they're trying someone for forgery this morning? −</t930> <t931>Treason! − Then it's drawing and quartering, - Jerry said.</t931> <t932>- Barbaric! −</t932> <t933>That's the law, - the old clerk said, looking in surprise at the errand boy.</t933> <t934>- That's the law.</t934>
<t935>− What kind of law is so cruel that it tears people apart, I thought.</t935> <t936>Killing is already cruel, but tearing people apart is excessively cruel.</t936>
<t937>− Not enough, - the old secretary retorted.</t937> <t938>- The law is still quite merciful.</t938> <t939>Keep your chest warm, talk less, my friend, and let the law handle it.</t939> <t940>That's my advice to you.</t940>
<t941>− Yes, this wet weather makes me feel chest tightness and hoarseness, - Jerry replied. - Just think about how wet my way of making a living must be.</t941>
<t942>− Ah, ah, - the old secretary said, - each of us has our own way of making a living.</t942> <t943>Some people have to endure wetness, while others stay dry.</t943> <t944>Here is the letter.</t944>
<t945>Go away.</t945>
<t946>Jerry held the letter, silently cursing to himself "That old man is a dried-up old coot" while bowing, then went outside to inform his son of the location and left immediately.</t946>
<t947>In those days, criminals were hanged at Tyburn, so the road outside Newgate Prison had not yet gained the infamy it would later acquire.</t947> <t948>But this prison was a dreadful place; countless heinous and corrupt acts occurred within its walls, and it was a breeding ground for diseases. Prisoners would bring their illnesses to court, and sometimes the disease would even spread from the dock to the Chief Justice, causing him to collapse from his bench.</t948> <t949>There were many instances where judges, donning the black cap to pronounce a death sentence, met their own end just like the condemned, sometimes even dying before the prisoners they sentenced.</t949> <t950>To everyone else, the infamous Old Bailey Criminal Court was known as a kind of death inn, from which pale convoys of prisoners continuously departed in carts and carriages on their brutal journey to the other world - a journey of about two and a half miles along public roads, causing some good Citizens to feel ashamed if they happened to encounter it.</t950> <t951>Violence, initially useful because it was necessary, had now become a habit.</t951> <t952>Old Bailey was also renowned for its long-standing custom of the pillory, where prisoners were shackled for public humiliation, a punishment without limits; another cherished old custom was the whipping post, where seeing a prisoner tied up and flogged was supposed to make one more compassionate and humane; and countless blood-stained coins were exchanged among hired killers, another testament to the wisdom of our ancestors, under whose sky so many horrifying crimes had taken place.</t952>
<t953>In summary, Old Bailey at that time was an excellent illustration of the principle "Everything that exists has its reason" - a decisive maxim that makes one lazy to think if it did not include the annoying corollary that: there is nothing in the world that is unreasonable.</t953>
<t954>Through the foul-smelling crowd scattering in all directions in this dreadful theater, the messenger, with the skill of someone accustomed to moving silently, found the necessary entrance and delivered the letter through a shuttered window carved into the large door.</t954> <t955>At that time, people paid to watch courtroom dramas at Old Bailey, just as they paid to watch scenes at the Bedlam* asylum - only watching trials was more expensive.</t955>
<t956>Therefore, all entrances to Old Bailey were carefully guarded - of course, this does not include the doors reserved for criminals to enter, which were always wide open.</t956>
<t957>After a moment of delay and hesitation, the door reluctantly swung on its hinges and opened slightly for Jerry Cruncher to slip into the courtroom.</t957>
<t958>− What's going on? - He whispered, asking a random person standing next to him.</t958>
<t959>− Nothing has been dealt with yet.</t959>
<t960>− What case is about to be tried? −</t960> <t961>The rebellion case.</t961>
<t962>− Is this crime punishable by dismemberment? −</t962> <t963>Aha! - The other person replied, with a delighted tone. - He will be brought to the gallows, hanged until nearly dead, then brought down, dismembered, after that his entrails will be extracted and burned right before his eyes, and only then will he be beheaded and quartered.</t963> <t964>That is the sentence.</t964>
<t965>− If he is guilty, is that what you mean? - Jerry asked tentatively.</t965>
<t966>− Oh! They will find him guilty, - the other person replied. - Don't worry about that.</t966>
<t967>Cruncher's attention now shifted to the doorman, whom he saw holding a letter and walking towards Mr. Lorry.</t967> <t968>Mr. Lorry was sitting at a table, among the wigged gentlemen; not far from him was another wigged gentleman - the defense attorney - with a thick stack of papers in front of him; and almost directly opposite this person was yet another wigged gentleman standing with both hands in his pockets, whom Cruncher always saw seemingly focused solely on the ceiling.</t968> <t969>After a few abrupt coughs, then rubbing his chin and gesturing, Jerry made Mr. Lorry notice him; Mr. Lorry had been standing up looking around for him and now nodded to indicate he had seen him before sitting back down.</t969>
<t970>− What does that man have to do with this case? - The person standing next to Jerry asked.</t970>
<t971>− How would I know, - Jerry replied.</t971>
<t972>− Then allow me to ask, what is your involvement in this case? −</t972> <t973>Same here. How would I know, - Jerry said.</t973>
<t974>The appearance of the Chief Justice and the subsequent commotion and then calm of the entire court immediately cut off the conversation.</t974> <t975>All attention then focused on the dock.</t975> <t976>The two wardens who had been standing there went out to bring the criminal in for trial.</t976>
<t977>Except for the gentleman with the wig staring at the ceiling, everyone present was intently watching the defendant.</t977> <t978>Every breath in the courtroom surged towards that person, like waves, like wind, like fire.</t978> <t979>Eager faces strained their necks around pillars and corners to get a clear view of the convict; the audience in the back rows stood up, trying not to miss a single hair; those in the front pressed their hands on the shoulders of those in the rows ahead to see clearly at any cost - standing on tiptoe, climbing on ledges, stepping on almost everything, to see every pore.</t979>
<t980>Standing out in the crowd ahead was Jerry with his hair bristling like iron spikes stuck on the walls of Newgate Prison; he directed towards the convict breaths heavy with the smell of beer consumed on the way here, his exhalations mingling with waves of the smell of yeast, alcohol, tea, coffee, and various other odors, surging towards the defendant and those foul waves splashed against the large windows of the Court with a misty, damp haze.</t980>
<t981>The focus of all these staring eyes and wheezing breaths was a young man around twenty-five years old, with a well-proportioned and handsome figure, sunburnt cheeks, and black eyes.</t981> <t982>His demeanor clearly indicated noble lineage.</t982> <t983>He wore a simple outfit in black, or very dark gray, with long black hair tied at the nape of his neck by a ribbon, more to keep it from covering his face than for style.</t983> <t984>No matter how much the body is covered, the spirit still reveals emotions, so his sunburnt brown cheeks could not hide the pallid, sickly hue emanating from within.</t984> <t985>But he appeared very calm, bowed to the Judge, and stood still.</t985>
<t986>The way they stared wide-eyed and breathed heavily, focusing on that young man, was not the kind of attention that makes a person more noble.</t986> <t987>If the defendant were facing the threat of a less terrifying sentence - if there were still a chance to escape any barbaric punishment - people certainly wouldn't have been so interested.</t987> <t988>It was the form that would suffer the fate of being shamefully dismembered that piqued curiosity; it was the mortal body that would be dissected and disemboweled that created such a stir.</t988>
<t989>No matter what false facade the audience wears to cover their intentions, depending on their skill and level of self-deception, the root of this interest is the primal desire to consume human flesh.</t989>
<t990>Order in the court! Charles Darnay yesterday pleaded not guilty to the indictment accusing the defendant of... (an endless stream of lively words)..</t990><t991>.</t991>
<t992>Therefore, the defendant is guilty of treason against our majestic, glorious, supreme, etc., King, because the defendant, on various occasions and in various ways, has assisted Louis, the King of France, in the war against our aforementioned majestic, glorious, supreme, etc., Emperor; specifically, by traveling between the territory of our aforementioned majestic, glorious, supreme, etc., kingdom and the territory of the aforementioned Louis of France, and has revealed in a harmful, wrongful, treacherous, and... (many other nefarious adverbs)... manner to the aforementioned Louis of France that our aforementioned majestic, glorious, supreme, etc., kingdom was preparing to send an army to Canada and North America...</t992> <t993>- Jerry, whose hair was standing more and more on end from hearing the legal jargon, was now relieved to understand; and so, after all the roundabout words, Jerry knew that it was now time for the aforementioned name, and the name that had been repeated so many times, Charles Darnay, to be tried; that the jury was being sworn in; and that the Attorney General was preparing to speak.</t993>
<t994>In this situation, the defendant - who was (and he knew he was) being silently hanged, beheaded, and dismembered in the imagination of everyone in the court - remained undaunted and did not show any sign of sorrow.</t994> <t995>He stood silently and attentively followed the preliminary procedures of the trial with a serious interest; his hands resting on the wooden railing of the dock, which had been sprinkled with herbs, so calmly that he didn't disturb a single blade of grass.</t995> <t996>The entire court had been sprinkled with medicinal leaves and vinegar as a preventive measure against the prison's toxic air and fever.</t996>
<t997>Above the prisoner's head is a mirror reflecting light down.</t997>
<t998>Countless malicious and wretched individuals have imprinted their images on that reflective surface, only to vanish from the mirror and the world of humanity.</t998>
<t999>If that glass could recreate every image that had ever been imprinted, like the ocean waves one day will throw back every drowned body, then surely this disgusting place would be flooded with haunting ghosts.</t999> <t1000>Perhaps a fleeting thought about those shameful, infamous reflections had arisen in the criminal's mind.</t1000> <t1001>Anyway, a change in posture made him notice a beam of light reflecting across his face, he looked up and when he saw his reflection in the mirror, he blushed and his right hand brushed the herbs aside.</t1001>
<t1002>The casual hand gesture happened to turn his face to the left.</t1002> <t1003>At eye level, sitting in the corner near the judge's seat were two people who immediately caught his attention, and his expression instantly changed, causing all eyes that were fixed on him to turn and look as well.</t1003>
<t1004>The audience sees two characters, a young lady just over twenty years old and a distinguished man clearly her father; his white hair and the indescribable expression on his face immediately draw attention - it is not a focused concentration but a deep, solitary contemplation.</t1004> <t1005>That expression makes him appear elderly, but when it is disrupted and fades away - as it does momentarily while he is talking to his daughter - he looks like a handsome man, still in his prime.</t1005>
<t1006>The daughter sat beside him, wrapping one arm around her father's arm, the other hand grasping his arm and pulling him close, clearly terrified of the trial and feeling compassion for the defendant.</t1006> <t1007>Her furrowed brow revealed all the horror and empathy she felt for the peril awaiting the other person.</t1007> <t1008>These emotions were so vividly, intensely, and naturally expressed that even those without a shred of compassion for the convict were moved and whispered to each other: "Who are they?".</t1008>
<t1009>All this time, while both observing and diligently sucking the rusty, fishy taste off his fingers, the contact Jerry craned his neck to listen and see who the other two people were.</t1009> <t1010>The crowd around kept asking each other questions, and the answers were passed to the nearest person, who would then be questioned and the answers would continue to spread until they finally reached Jerry's ears: −</t1010> <t1011>That witness.</t1011>
<t1012>− For which side? − For the prosecution.</t1012>
<t1013>− Accuse whom? − That prisoner.</t1013>
<t1014>The Chief Justice's eyes, drawn by the crowd's gaze, now returned to the judge's position. He leaned back in his chair, staring intently at the person whose life he held in his hands, while the Attorney General stood up to tighten the noose, sharpen the axe, and nail the scaffold.</t1014>
<t1015>3.</t1015> <t1016>Disappointment</t1016>
<t1017>The Attorney General must inform the jury that the defendant before them, though young in age, is seasoned in treacherous schemes that have led him to face the ultimate penalty of death.</t1017> <t1018>That, collusion with the enemy nation is not something that started today, or yesterday, or even last year or the year before.</t1018> <t1019>That, certainly, this defendant, over a long period, has frequently traveled between France and England, engaging in secret activities that he has not honestly disclosed.</t1019> <t1020>That, if these treasonous acts had naturally developed (fortunately, this did not happen), the true danger and guilt of his actions might not have been uncovered.</t1020>
<t1021>That, thanks to the Almighty's urging, a person with a fearless heart, undeterred by difficulties, discovered the nature of his schemes, and this person, being too horrified, reported it to the Secretary of State and the esteemed Privy Council.</t1021><t1022>That, this patriot will present himself before the jury.</t1022><t1023>That, the status and character of this person are all noble.</t1023><t1024>That, this person was once a friend of the accused, but at the fortunate yet unfortunate moment, discovered the crimes of the friend he dearly loved, and decided to sacrifice that traitor on the sacred altar of the Fatherland.</t1024><t1025>That, if England, like ancient Greece and Rome, issued decrees to erect statues of the nation's benefactors, this distinguished Citizen would surely be honored.</t1025><t1026>That, since England has no such decree, this person will not have a statue erected.</t1026><t1027>That, virtue is inherently contagious; especially the shining virtue of patriotism, or love for the country - a sentiment recorded by poets (in many verses which the Attorney General knows the jury must have memorized word for word; hearing this, the jurors' faces showed guilty consciences because they did not know a single verse).</t1027><t1028>That, the noble example of this unimpeachable witness to the Kingdom, whom we are not worthy to honor by name, spread to the servant of the accused and inspired that servant to nobly rummage through the master's pockets and drawers and hide many documents.</t1028><t1029>That, he (the Attorney General) is ready to hear slanderous insults against this admirable servant; but that, he cherishes this servant more than his own siblings (of the Attorney General) and respects this servant more than his own parents (of the Attorney General).</t1029><t1030>That, he confidently calls upon the jury to do as he does.</t1030><t1031>That, the evidence from these two witnesses, along with the documents they discovered and are about to present to the court, will show that the accused had obtained lists of the Royal forces, along with deployment plans, both naval and military, and undoubtedly had regularly transmitted such information to the enemy forces.</t1031><t1032>That, it cannot be proven that these lists were written by the accused's own hand; but this does not lessen the severity and instead facilitates the prosecution; that, it shows the accused's cunning precautions.</t1032><t1033>That, the evidence shows that five years ago, the accused undertook these dangerous tasks, just weeks before the first battle between the British army and the Americans*.</t1033><t1034>That, for these reasons, the jury, being loyal (as he knows they are) and responsible (as they know they are) - must unequivocally find the accused guilty and must sentence him to death, whether they wish to or not.</t1034><t1035>That, they cannot eat or sleep well; that, they cannot accept the idea of their wives eating or sleeping well; that, they cannot tolerate the thought of their children eating or sleeping well; in short, no one, whether themselves or their wives and children, can eat or sleep well anymore if the accused is not beheaded.</t1035><t1036>That head, the Attorney General demands the jury to sever, in the name of all that is good and reasonable that he can think of, and with unwavering belief, he solemnly concludes that he considers the accused as surely dead.</t1036>
<t1037>When the Attorney General stopped speaking, the entire courtroom buzzed like a swarm of blue flies surrounding the defendant, eagerly awaiting the fate he would face.</t1037> <t1038>When the noise subsided, the unimpeachable patriot appeared in the witness stand.</t1038>
<t1039>After that, the Deputy Attorney General, following the guidance of the Attorney General, questioned the patriot: a gentleman named John Barsad.</t1039> <t1040>His self-declaration of a clear conscience was similar to what the Attorney General had described; perhaps the only reproach was that it was almost identical to the Attorney General's words.</t1040> <t1041>After unburdening his noble heart, he should have humbly withdrawn, but the barrister wearing a wig, holding a stack of papers, sitting in front of him not far from Mr. Lorry, requested to ask a few questions.</t1041> <t1042>Meanwhile, the gentleman wearing a wig opposite the barrister continued to gaze at the ceiling.</t1042>
<t1043>Has the witness ever worked as a spy?</t1043> <t1044>No, he despises such a vile insinuation.</t1044> <t1045>How does the witness make a living? From personal assets.</t1045> <t1046>Where did the witness's assets come from?</t1046> <t1047>The witness does not remember exactly where they came from.</t1047> <t1048>What are those assets? It's a private matter and cannot be disclosed.</t1048> <t1049>Did the witness inherit those assets?</t1049> <t1050>Yes, he admits.</t1050>
<t1051>Whose inheritance? Distant relatives.</t1051><t1052>Very distant? Quite distant.</t1052><t1053>Ever been to prison?</t1053><t1054>Definitely not.</t1054><t1055>Ever been imprisoned for debt?</t1055><t1056>I don't understand what that has to do with this.</t1056><t1057>Ever been imprisoned for debt?...</t1057><t1058>There, asking again! Yes or no? Yes.</t1058><t1059>How many times? Two or three times.</t1059><t1060>Not five or six times?</t1060><t1061>Maybe.</t1061><t1062>What is the witness's occupation? Noble.</t1062><t1063>Ever been kicked by someone?</t1063><t1064>Maybe.</t1064><t1065>Frequently? No.</t1065><t1066>Ever been kicked down the stairs?</t1066><t1067>Definitely not; once kicked at the top of the stairs, and the witness rolled down voluntarily.</t1067><t1068>Kicked for cheating at dice, right?</t1068><t1069>The drunk who assaulted me said something like that, but it's not true.</t1069><t1070>Dare to swear it's not true?</t1070><t1071>Absolutely.</t1071><t1072>Ever made a living by cheating at gambling?</t1072><t1073>Never.</t1073><t1074>Ever made a living by gambling?</t1074><t1075>Just like everyone else.</t1075><t1076>Ever borrowed money from that defendant? Yes.</t1076><t1077>Paid it back? No.</t1077><t1078>Isn't the witness's relationship with the defendant actually very superficial, only due to chance encounters on carriages, in inns, and on steamships?</t1078><t1079>No.</t1079><t1080>Are you sure the witness saw the defendant with these lists? Absolutely.</t1080><t1081>Know anything more about these lists? No.</t1081><t1082>Isn't it true that the witness personally tried to obtain these documents? No.</t1082><t1083>With these exhibits, does the witness hope to receive any reward?</t1083><t1084>No.</t1084><t1085>The witness is not on the government payroll and hired to harm others, right? Oh heavens, no.</t1085><t1086>Or to do anything else?</t1086><t1087>Oh heavens, nothing else.</t1087><t1088>Dare to swear?</t1088><t1089>Swear a thousand times, no.</t1089><t1090>The witness has no motive other than patriotism, right?</t1090><t1091>No other motive.</t1091>
<t1092>It was the turn of the virtuous servant Roger Cly to take the oath before the interrogation.</t1092> <t1093>He had been working for the defendant for four years and knew nothing. He had asked the defendant on the Calais train if the defendant needed a servant, and the defendant had hired him.</t1093> <t1094>It was not out of charity that he asked the defendant to let him serve - he had no such thought.</t1094> <t1095>Soon after, he began to suspect the defendant and kept an eye on him.</t1095> <t1096>While arranging the defendant's clothes during travels, he had seen lists similar to these in the defendant's pockets many times. He had taken these lists from the defendant's desk drawer.</t1096> <t1097>He had not placed those papers in the drawer from the beginning.</t1097> <t1098>He had seen the defendant show similar lists to many French people in Calais, and similar lists to many French people in both Calais and Boulogne.</t1098> <t1099>He was patriotic and could not accept that, so he went to report it.</t1099> <t1100>He had never been suspected of stealing a silver teapot; he had been falsely accused of stealing a mustard pot, but it turned out to be just silver-plated.</t1100> <t1101>He had known the previous witness for seven or eight years; it was just a coincidence.</t1101> <t1102>He did not find it a strange coincidence because all coincidences are strange.</t1102> <t1103>Nor did he find it a strange coincidence that his sole motive was patriotism.</t1103> <t1104>He was a true Englishman and hoped many others were like him.</t1104>
<t1105>The entire courtroom was once again filled with the buzzing of bluebottle flies, and the Attorney General called Mr. Jarvis Lorry to the stand.</t1105>
<t1106>− Mr. Jarvis Lorry, are you an employee of Tellson's Bank? − Yes, I am.</t1106>
<t1107>− On a Friday in November 1775, did you travel from London to Dover by mail coach for work? −</t1107> <t1108>Yes, I did.</t1108>
<t1109>− Were there any other passengers on the mail coach? −</t1109> <t1110>Two people.</t1110>
<t1111>− Did they get off the bus along the way during the night? −</t1111> <t1112>That's right.</t1112>
<t1113>− Mr. Lorry, look at the defendant over there.</t1113> <t1114>Is the defendant one of those two passengers? −</t1114> <t1115>I cannot answer this question.</t1115>
<t1116>− Does the defendant resemble either of the two passengers? −</t1116> <t1117>Both were wearing cloaks that covered them completely, it was pitch dark, and we were all cautious, so I can't even answer this question.</t1117>
<t1118>− Mr. Lorry, please look at the defendant once more.</t1118> <t1119>Suppose the defendant were cloaked like the other two passengers, would the defendant's build and height resemble either of those two passengers? −</t1119> <t1120>No.</t1120>
<t1121>− Mr. Lorry, do you dare swear that the defendant is not one of those two passengers? −</t1121> <t1122>No.</t1122>
<t1123>− So at the very least, you believe the defendant could be one of those two people, right? −</t1123> <t1124>Yes.</t1124> <t1125>It's just that I remember both of those people... looking like me...</t1125>
<t1126>Everyone was afraid of the highway robbers, but this person did not seem to be afraid at all.</t1126>
<t1127>− Have you ever seen someone pretend to be shy, Mr. Lorry? −</t1127> <t1128>I'm sure I have.</t1128>
<t1129>− Mr. Lorry, please look at the defendant once more.</t1129> <t1130>Are you certain that you have met the defendant before? −</t1130> <t1131>I have met him.</t1131>
<t1132>− When? − That was a few days later, when I returned from France, and in Calais, this person boarded the ship that brought me back to the country, and traveled on the same trip with me.</t1132>
<t1133>− At what time did the defendant board the train? −</t1133> <t1134>A little after midnight.</t1134>
<t1135>− Right in the middle of the night.</t1135> <t1136>Was the defendant the only passenger to board the train at that late hour? −</t1136> <t1137>It happened that this person was the only one.</t1137>
<t1138>− Don't worry about the "coincidence," Mr. Lorry.</t1138> <t1139>The defendant was the only passenger who boarded the train at midnight, correct? −</t1139> <t1140>That's right.</t1140>
<t1141>− Were you traveling alone or with someone at that time, Mr. Lorry? −</t1141> <t1142>With two companions.</t1142> <t1143>A gentleman and a lady.</t1143> <t1144>They are present in the court.</t1144>
<t1145>− They are present at the court.</t1145> <t1146>Did you have any conversation with the defendant at that time? −</t1146> <t1147>Absolutely not.</t1147> <t1148>It was stormy, the journey was long, and the sea was rough, I was mostly lying on the sofa from one shore to the other.</t1148>
<t1149>− Miss Manette! The girl stood up from her seat, and all the eyes that had been looking at her earlier now turned back towards her.</t1149> <t1150>Her father stood up as well, still holding his daughter's arm.</t1150>
<t1151>− Miss Manette, please look at the defendant.</t1151>
<t1152>For the convict, facing such mercy and such youthful beauty was far more difficult than facing this entire crowd.</t1152> <t1153>Even though he did not waver when standing close to the grave, challenging all the curious eyes watching him, he still momentarily lost his composure before the girl's gaze.</t1153>
<t1154>The convict's right hand hastily swept aside the herbs in front of him, turning them into imaginary flower beds; and the effort to maintain steady breathing caused his lips to tremble and turn pale, as if the blood was flowing back to his heart.</t1154>
<t1155>The swarm of blue flies buzzed noisily again.</t1155>
<t1156>− Miss Manette, have you ever met the defendant before? −</t1156> <t1157>Yes, I have.</t1157>
<t1158>− Where? −</t1158> <t1159>On the mail ship just mentioned, sir, and on the same occasion.</t1159>
<t1160>− Are you the young lady who was just mentioned? −</t1160> <t1161>Oh! Unfortunately, that is me! The girl's sorrowful and compassionate voice was drowned out by the aggressive and not-so-gentle voice of the Judge: "Answer the question directly without making any comments." −</t1161> <t1162>Miss Manette, did you have any conversation with the defendant during the crossing of the strait? −</t1162> <t1163>Yes, sir.</t1163>
<t1164>− Please tell the story again.</t1164>
<t1165>The entire courtroom fell silent as the young woman softly said, "When that gentleman boarded the train..."</t1165>
<t1166>− You mean the defendant, right? - The judge asked, frowning.</t1166>
<t1167>− Yes, Your Honor.</t1167>
<t1168>− Then we must call him the defendant.</t1168>
<t1169>− When the defendant boarded the ship, he saw my father, - the girl directed a loving gaze at the person standing next to her, - too tired and in poor health.</t1169> <t1170>My father was so weak that I feared he would have difficulty breathing, so I made a bed for him on the deck near the steps leading to the cabin, and I sat on the deck next to him to take care of him.</t1170> <t1171>That night, there were no other passengers except the four of us.</t1171> <t1172>The defendant kindly asked for permission to show me how to shield my father from the wind and rain, even better than I could.</t1172> <t1173>I couldn't do it because I didn't know which direction the wind would blow when the ship left the port.</t1173> <t1174>He helped me with it.</t1174> <t1175>He showed great care and kindness towards my father's health condition, and I firmly believe he was sincere.</t1175>
<t1176>We started talking to each other like that.</t1176>
<t1177>− Let me interrupt you for a moment.</t1177> <t1178>The defendant boarded the train alone, didn't they? −</t1178> <t1179>No.</t1179>
<t1180>− How many people went with him? −</t1180> <t1181>Two French gentlemen.</t1181>
<t1182>− Did they discuss anything with each other? −</t1182> <t1183>They discussed until the last minute, when those French gentlemen had to leave the ship and board their boat.</t1183>
<t1184>− Did they exchange any documents similar to these lists? −</t1184> <t1185>They exchanged some documents, but I don't know what kind of documents.</t1185>
<t1186>− Does it resemble the shape and size of these documents? −</t1186> <t1187>Maybe, but honestly I don't know, even though they were whispering right next to me; because there was a lamp hanging at the top of the steps leading down to the bedroom, they stood there for the light; the light was very dim, and they spoke very softly, I couldn't hear what they were saying, I only saw them looking at the documents.</t1187>
<t1188>− Now let's talk about the conversation with the defendant, Miss Manette.</t1188>
<t1189>− The defendant seemed straightforward and trustworthy... because in that situation I didn't know what to do... because he was also kind and gentle with me just like he was with my father.</t1189> <t1190>I hope that... - the girl burst into tears - ... that today I don't have to repay him with words that harm him.</t1190>
<t1191>The swarm of green flies buzzed again.</t1191>
<t1192>− Miss Manette, if the defendant does not fully understand that you were extremely reluctant to provide the evidence that you had a duty to provide, the evidence that you must provide, and the evidence that you could not avoid providing, then everyone here except the defendant understands.</t1192>
<t1193>Please continue speaking.</t1193>
<t1194>− He told me that he was doing a delicate and difficult job, one that could cause trouble for many people, so he used a fake name when traveling.</t1194> <t1195>He said that this job, in a few days, would take him back to France, and he might have to travel back and forth between France and England many times over the coming period.</t1195>
<t1196>− Did the defendant say anything about the matter in America, Miss Manette? Please be clear.</t1196>
<t1197>− He tried to explain to me how the conflict had arisen, and he said that, in his opinion, the British side was wrong and foolish.</t1197> <t1198>He jokingly added that perhaps George Washington would become as famous in history as King George III. But he said this without any malice; it was just said to pass the time with some laughter.</t1198>
<t1199>Any prominent expression on the face of the main character in an engaging play will be unconsciously mimicked by the audience. The girl's forehead furrows with concentration and anxiety, turning to anguish as she testifies in court. During the moments she pauses for the Judge to take notes and observes the reactions of both the defense and prosecution officials,</t1199> <t1200>throughout the courtroom, every curious onlooker shares that same expression. To the extent that when the Judge puts down his pen and looks up, his face stern from the highly disrespectful remark about George Washington, the majority of foreheads in the room become mirrors reflecting the emotions of the girl witness.</t1200>
<t1201>The Attorney General now signaled to the Chief Justice, indicating that it was time to question Dr. Manette, the girl's father, in accordance with procedure and as a precaution.</t1201>
<t1202>This person was called to testify.</t1202>
<t1203>− Dr. Manette, please look at the defendant over there.</t1203> <t1204>Have you ever met the defendant before? −</t1204> <t1205>Once. When this person visited my house in London.</t1205> <t1206>About three or three and a half years ago.</t1206>
<t1207>− Did you recognize the defendant as the person who was on the same train, or did he talk to your daughter? −</t1207> <t1208>Your Honor, I am not aware of either of those things.</t1208>
<t1209>− Is there a specific and special reason why you were not aware of both of those things? −</t1209> <t1210>Yes, - he replied softly.</t1210>
<t1211>− Doctor Manette, in France you were imprisoned for a long time without trial, or even without any charges, is that correct? −</t1211> <t1212>Imprisoned for a very long time, - his voice responded, moving everyone deeply.</t1212>
<t1213>− When you took that train, you had just been released from prison, hadn't you? −</t1213> <t1214>That's what they told me.</t1214>
<t1215>− Do you not remember anything about that train journey? −</t1215> <t1216>No.</t1216> <t1217>I lost my memory for a long time... I don't even know how long... from when I started making shoes in prison until I found myself in London with my daughter here.</t1217> <t1218>I recognized my daughter when God restored my memory; but I still don't know how I came to meet my child.</t1218> <t1219>I don't remember how it happened at all.</t1219>
<t1220>The Attorney General sat down, and the father and son also sat down at the same time.</t1220>
<t1221>Then a strange situation occurred during the trial.</t1221> <t1222>The main objective was to prove that the defendant, along with an unknown accomplice, had taken the Dover mail coach on a Friday night in November five years ago, had gotten off during the night to mislead, disembarked at a place he did not stay but went back about twelve miles or more, to a place with a military base and a shipyard, and then gathered information there; a witness was called to confirm that the defendant was present at that exact time, in the dining room of a hotel in the city with the military base and shipyard, waiting to meet another person.</t1222> <t1223>The defense lawyer was still questioning this witness without any results, except for the witness's admission that he had never met the defendant in any other circumstances, when the gentleman with the wig, who had been staring at the ceiling, wrote a few words on a piece of paper, crumpled it up, and tossed it to the lawyer.</t1223> <t1224>During a pause between two questions, the lawyer opened the piece of paper, read it, and then looked very attentively and curiously towards the defendant.</t1224>
<t1225>− Do you dare to say again that you are certain this is the defendant?</t1225> <t1226>The witness is completely certain.</t1226>
<t1227>− Have you ever seen anyone who looks very much like this defendant? −</t1227> <t1228>Not similar enough to be mistaken for, - the witness said.</t1228>
<t1229>− Look carefully at that gentleman, he is my colleague, - the lawyer pointed towards the person who threw the piece of paper, - then look carefully at the defendant.</t1229>
<t1230>What did he say?</t1230> <t1231>Do they look exactly alike?</t1231> <t1232>Except for the careless and slovenly, if not downright shabby, appearance of our esteemed colleague, the other two were so alike that both the witness and everyone in the court were astonished when they recognized the resemblance.</t1232> <t1233>After the judge requested our esteemed colleague to remove his wig and he complied with a look of displeasure, the resemblance became even more strikingly clear.</t1233> <t1234>The judge asked Mr. Stryver (the defense attorney) whether they were intending to try Mr. Carton (our esteemed colleague) for treason.</t1234> <t1235>Mr. Stryver replied that no, but he would ask the witness whether he was certain that what had happened once could not happen again; whether the witness was so hasty as to be sure he had met the defendant if he had encountered such a look-alike before; and now that he had seen this, whether he could still be so sure, along with many other questions.</t1235> <t1236>The result was that the witness's credibility in court was shattered like a clay pot, and his testimony became a heap of useless fragments.</t1236>
<t1237>At this point, Cruncher had thoroughly sucked the rusty, metallic taste from his fingers, substituting it for lunch while he listened to the testimonies.</t1237><t1238>Now he listened as Mr. Stryver refuted the incriminating evidence, much like tailoring a suit to fit the jury; the lawyer showed them that the patriot Barsad was actually a paid informant and traitor, a shameless human trafficker, and one of the most wicked men since Judas Iscariot - who, incidentally, bore a striking resemblance to Judas.</t1238><t1239>As for the virtuous servant Cly, he was Barsad's friend and accomplice, no better than him; the lawyer demonstrated how these two perjurers, who had sworn false oaths, had targeted the defendant and plotted his downfall; the defendant, being of French origin, had business that required him to travel frequently between the two countries - matters involving his closest and dearest associates, which he would never reveal even under the threat of death.</t1239><t1240>The lawyer proved that the testimony of the young lady, who everyone could see had suffered greatly while testifying, had been distorted and coerced into worthless evidence; it was merely polite, impartial conversation that any gentleman or lady might exchange upon meeting - except for the wildly outrageous comment about George Washington, which could only be seen as a crude joke and nothing more.</t1240><t1241>The lawyer argued that it would be a weakness in governance to undermine the effort to win the affection of the subjects through fear and hatred sown among the public, and this was something the Attorney General had exploited to the fullest; however, this meant nothing beyond the fact that the vile and despicable nature of the evidence often discredited such trials, and this was abundantly documented in our country's State Trials.</t1241><t1242>But at this point, the judge interrupted (with a stern face as if the lawyer had not spoken the truth), declaring that he could not accept such insinuations during the trial.</t1242>
<t1243>Mr. Stryver then called a few more of his witnesses, and afterwards Cruncher attentively listened to the Attorney General turn the suit that Mr. Stryver had dressed the jury in inside out; the Attorney General proved that Barsad and Cly were even better people than he had ever imagined, while the defendant was a hundred times worse.</t1243> <t1244>Finally, it was the Chief Justice's turn to turn the suit inside out and right side out again, but overall he decided to cut it down into a shroud to drape over the defendant.</t1244>
<t1245>Now it's time for the jury to deliberate and the blue flies to swarm and buzz again.</t1245>
<t1246>Right in this bustling scene, lawyer Carton - who had been sitting and staring at the ceiling - did not change his posture or attitude at all.</t1246> <t1247>While his colleague Stryver was gathering the papers in front of him and whispering to those sitting nearby, occasionally glancing anxiously at the jury; while everyone attending the trial moved around and formed new groups to some extent; while even the judge left his seat and slowly paced back and forth on the platform, causing the crowd to suspect that he was inwardly impatient; only Carton remained leaning back in his chair, his old robe almost slipping off his shoulders, his disheveled wig haphazardly perched on his head as if protesting being removed earlier, his hands in his pockets, his eyes still fixed on the ceiling.</t1247> <t1248>That very disdainful attitude not only made him appear somewhat disreputable but also diminished the undeniable resemblance to the defendant (a resemblance that was quite clear when he temporarily showed seriousness for everyone to compare their appearances), to the extent that many trial spectators now, upon noticing Carton, remarked to each other that they did not see much similarity between this man and the accused.</t1248> <t1249>Cruncher made such a remark to the person standing next to him and added: −</t1249> <t1250>I'd bet half a guinea that this lawyer isn't hired by many to argue their cases.</t1250> <t1251>Doesn't look like the kind of lawyer who has work to do, right?</t1251> <t1252>However, this Carton fellow, despite appearances, was clearly observing everything in the court; because at this moment, when Miss Manette collapsed into her father's arms, it was he who first noticed and shouted: −</t1252> <t1253>Officer?!</t1253> <t1254>Take care of the young lady.</t1254> <t1255>Help that gentleman take her outside.</t1255> <t1256>Can't you see she's about to faint?!</t1256> <t1257>The crowd felt very sorry for the young lady and sympathized with the father as she was taken outside.</t1257> <t1258>The father was clearly extremely distressed, having to recall the days of his imprisonment.</t1258> <t1259>He was deeply moved when questioned, and from that moment on, he looked much older, his face perpetually gloomy and contemplative as if shrouded by dark clouds.</t1259> <t1260>As he walked out, the jury turned around and took a break so that the foreman could speak to the court on their behalf.</t1260>
<t1261>The jury did not have a unanimous opinion and wanted to retreat to the deliberation room.</t1261> <t1262>The Judge (probably still preoccupied with thoughts of George Washington) was somewhat surprised that the jury was not unanimous, but agreed to let them meet in private under supervision, and he himself temporarily withdrew.</t1262> <t1263>The trial had lasted all day, and the lights in the courtroom were now being turned on.</t1263> <t1264>People began to gossip that the jury would be deliberating for quite a while.</t1264> <t1265>The audience then dispersed for a break, and the defendant retreated to the back of the dock and sat down to await their fate.</t1265>
<t1266>Mr. Lorry, who had just gone out following the girl and her father, now came back in and signaled to Jerry; the messenger easily reached him as the general curiosity around had subsided.</t1266>
<t1267>− Jerry, if you want to get something to eat, just go.</t1267> <t1268>But stay nearby.</t1268>
<t1269>You must pay attention to when the jury returns and follow them immediately without delay, because I need you to deliver the verdict to the bank.</t1269> <t1270>You are the fastest messenger I know, surely you will reach Temple Bar long before I do.</t1270>
<t1271>Jerry could only raise his finger to tap his forehead; he tapped his forehead to confirm this message and a shilling along with it.</t1271> <t1272>At that moment, attorney Carton appeared and took Mr. Lorry's arm: −</t1272> <t1273>How is the lady? −</t1273> <t1274>She is extremely miserable; but her father is comforting her, and once out of the court, she recovered.</t1274>
<t1275>− I will let the prisoner know.</t1275> <t1276>You know, it wouldn't be appropriate for someone as respectable as you from the bank to be seen talking openly with him.</t1276>
<t1277>Mr. Lorry blushed as if he too were secretly pondering that matter, and so Carton walked slowly towards the outer edge of the dock.</t1277> <t1278>The exit from the court was also in that direction, and Jerry followed, wide-eyed, straining his ears, his hair standing on end.</t1278>
<t1279>− Mr. Darnay!</t1279> <t1280>The prisoner stepped forward immediately.</t1280>
<t1281>− I am sure you are eager to hear news about the witness, Miss Manette.</t1281> <t1282>She will be fine.</t1282> <t1283>Earlier, you saw her being too emotional.</t1283>
<t1284>− I'm very sorry for causing this.</t1284> <t1285>If you could convey this message to her, I would be very grateful.</t1285>
<t1286>− Alright.</t1286> <t1287>I will pass on the message, if you want.</t1287>
<t1288>Carton's attitude was so indifferent that it bordered on insolence.</t1288> <t1289>He stood there, lazily leaning his elbow on the rail, not bothering to look directly at the defendant.</t1289>
<t1290>− Please help me.</t1290> <t1291>I sincerely thank you.</t1291>
<t1292>− Hey, Darnay, - Carton said without looking directly at the listener, - what sentence are you expecting? −</t1292> <t1293>The heaviest sentence.</t1293>
<t1294>− Waiting is the wisest choice, and that is the highest possibility.</t1294>
<t1295>But I think their retreating for a discussion is beneficial for you.</t1295>
<t1296>The court did not allow any further delay, Jerry walked out of the court hearing nothing more; despite the two people - identical in appearance but completely opposite in demeanor - standing next to each other, their reflections mirrored on the ceiling glass.</t1296>
<t1297>An hour and a half dragged on slowly in the crowded corridors filled with ruffians below, regardless of how much beer and lamb pâté had been consumed.</t1297> <t1298>The hoarse-voiced messenger sat restlessly on a bench, and after a while of pondering, he suddenly fell asleep until the noise and the throng of people surging up the stairs leading to the court woke him up and swept him along.</t1298>
<t1299>− Jerry! Jerry! - Mr. Lorry was standing at the doorway calling loudly as he just arrived.</t1299>
<t1300>− Yes, I'm here!</t1300> <t1301>Chen struggled for a long time to get back.</t1301> <t1302>I'm here, sir! Mr. Lorry reached through the crowd to hand him a piece of paper.</t1302>
<t1303>− Hurry up! Did you get it? − Yes, I got it.</t1303>
<t1304>Hastily written on the paper were the words "PARDONED".</t1304>
<t1305>− If you text "Revive" like last time, - Jerry muttered as he turned away, - then this time I already understand what you mean.</t1305>
<t1306>Jerry had no chance to say or even think anything else until he was out of the Old Bailey Courthouse; because he had to run frantically to avoid being knocked over by the crowd pouring out, and the buzzing noise flooding the street was like a swarm of disappointed bluebottles dispersing to find another decaying corpse.</t1306>
<t1307>4.</t1307> <t1308>Congratulations</t1308>
<t1309>Flowing out of the dimly lit corridors of the court, the final remnants of the human stew that had been boiling all day were now gradually drying up as Dr. Manette, his daughter Lucie Manette, Mr. Lorry, and the defense attorney Stryver stood around Charles Darnay - just released, congratulating him on escaping death.</t1309>
<t1310>Under a stronger light source, it might be difficult to recognize Dr. Manette with his intelligent face and upright posture as the shoemaker in the attic in Paris. However, anyone who has looked at him closely once cannot help but look again; even if they do not have the chance to hear the melancholy tone in his gentle, solemn voice, or see the occasional absent-minded expression that inexplicably appears on his face.</t1310> <t1311>Just like during the trial, any external trigger that reminds him of the years of prolonged suffering will cause that dark emotion to rise from the depths of his soul, but that dazed expression also often reveals itself, startling those who do not know Dr. Manette's past; as if they are seeing the actual Bastille casting its dark shadow on his face under the summer sun while in reality, that place of imprisonment is three hundred miles away from here.</t1311>
<t1312>Only the daughter had the power to dispel the dark clouds from her father's mind.</t1312> <t1313>She was the golden thread connecting him to the past before the calamity, and to the present after escaping captivity; her voice, her radiant face, her comforting hand, always had the supreme power to help him find joy in life.</t1313> <t1314>But it wasn't always so, for she also remembered times when her power had failed; however, those instances were rare and not very serious, so she thought they would not happen again.</t1314>
<t1315>Darnay warmly and appreciatively kissed the girl's hand, then turned to barrister Stryver and thanked him profusely.</t1315> <t1316>Stryver, though just over thirty, looked as old as fifty, stout, loud, ruddy, straightforward, and completely lacking in tact; he often barged (both mentally and physically) into groups of people and conversations - this clearly showed the way he scrambled to get ahead in life.</t1316>
<t1317>Still wearing his wig and barrister's gown, Stryver spoke while stepping in front of his new client to the point of pushing Mr. Lorry out of the group: −</t1317> <t1318>I am very pleased to have the honor of successfully defending you, Mr. Darnay.</t1318> <t1319>This was a vile case; extremely vile; but it's not just about wanting to convict.</t1319>
<t1320>− I am indebted to you for saving my life forever, - the client said while shaking the lawyer's hand.</t1320>
<t1321>− I did my best, Mr. Darnay; and I think everyone should do their best like I did.</t1321>
<t1322>To say that would force someone to praise "No one can compare," it was Mr. Lorry who said that, not entirely disinterestedly but with the intention of wanting to get back into the group.</t1322>
<t1323>− Do you think so? - Stryver said. - Well! You've been here all day today, you must know well.</t1323> <t1324>You are also a man of work.</t1324>
<t1325>− That's right, - Mr. Lorry, who had now been nudged into the group by the lawyer in the same way he had been nudged out earlier, - and because that's right, I request Dr. Manette to conclude this consultation and for all of us to leave.</t1325> <t1326>Miss Lucie doesn't look well, Mr. Darnay has had a terrible day, and we are all exhausted.</t1326>
<t1327>− Please don't speak for others, Mr. Lorry, - Stryver said, - I have work to do tonight.</t1327> <t1328>Please don't speak for others.</t1328>
<t1329>− I speak for myself, - Mr. Lorry replied, - and for you, Darnay, and for Miss Lucie, and...</t1329> <t1330>Miss Lucie, do you think I can speak on behalf of all of us? - He asked her directly, his eyes glancing at her father again.</t1330>
<t1331>The face of Doctor Manette at that moment had frozen into a very strange look directed at Darnay - a focused look, under furrowed brows that clearly revealed aversion and suspicion, with a hint of fear.</t1331> <t1332>With that peculiar expression, his mind had wandered elsewhere.</t1332>
<t1333>− Father, - Lucie said as she gently took her father's hand.</t1333>
<t1334>The gloomy expression gradually faded, and the father turned to look at his daughter.</t1334>
<t1335>−</t1335> <t1336>Shall we go home, Father? After a sigh, there was a "Yes".</t1336>
<t1337>The friends of the acquitted convict had long since dispersed, with the thought - originating from the man himself - that he would not be pardoned tonight.</t1337> <t1338>The lights in the corridors had almost all been extinguished, the iron gates were clanging shut, and this dreadful theater would remain desolate until the next morning when the delight of the gallows, the stocks, the whipping post, and the branding iron would draw the audience again.</t1338> <t1339>Walking between her father and Darnay, Lucie Manette stepped out onto the street.</t1339> <t1340>A two-horse carriage was called, and the father and daughter got in and drove away.</t1340>
<t1341>Stryver had just left everyone in the hallway to barge back into the dressing room.</t1341> <t1342>Another person, who had neither joined the group nor spoken a word to anyone in it, but had been leaning against the wall in the darkest corner, now strolled out and stood watching until the carriage was out of sight.</t1342> <t1343>He then stepped onto the sidewalk where Mr. Lorry and Darnay were standing.</t1343>
<t1344>− Ah, Mr. Lorry! The man of business is now allowed to speak openly with Mr. Darnay, isn't he?</t1344> <t1345>No one mentioned Carton's role in today's trial; no one paid any attention to him.</t1345> <t1346>Carton had taken off his barrister's gown and still looked as disheveled as before.</t1346>
<t1347>− Mr. Darnay, if only you knew what was wrestling in the mind of a person who only knows how to work, when that work-focused mind is divided between the urge of kindness and the outward professional demeanor, you would find it very interesting.</t1347>
<t1348>Mr. Lorry blushed and said passionately, "You mentioned that earlier, sir."</t1348> <t1349>People of business like us, those who serve a company, cannot think only of ourselves.</t1349> <t1350>We must think of the company more than ourselves.</t1350>
<t1351>− I know, I know, - Carton replied nonchalantly.</t1351> <t1352>- Don't be upset, Mr. Lorry, you are as wonderful as everyone else, I'm sure of it; I even dare to say that no one is like you.</t1352>
<t1353>− That's right, sir, - Mr. Lorry continued, not paying attention to Carton's sarcasm.</t1353> <t1354>- Honestly, I don't know what your involvement in this matter is.</t1354> <t1355>Please forgive me, an older man than you, for saying this, but I truly don't know what your role in this matter is.</t1355>
<t1356>− Work! Good Lord, I have no work, - Carton said.</t1356>
<t1357>− It's a pity for you, sir.</t1357>
<t1358>− I think so too.</t1358>
<t1359>− If you have any work, - Mr. Lorry continued, - perhaps you will devote yourself to it.</t1359>
<t1360>− God bless you, oh no... I'm not like that! - Carton said.</t1360>
<t1361>− Hey, you! - Mr. Lorry shouted, Carton's indifference made him angry.</t1361> <t1362>- Working is very good, very respectable.</t1362> <t1363>And let me tell you, if work requires us to restrain ourselves, to be silent, to accept, then this kind Mr. Darnay here understands those constraints very well.</t1363> <t1364>Goodbye Mr. Darnay, God bless you! I hope from today you will have a successful and happy life ahead of you.</t1364> <t1365>The carriage is here!</t1365> <t1366>Perhaps a bit angry with himself as well as with that lawyer, Mr. Lorry hastily got into the single-horse carriage and headed to Tellson's Bank.</t1366> <t1367>Still reeking of port wine and seemingly not fully sober, Carton then laughed and turned to Darnay: − It is indeed strange that you and I happen to meet. Do you not find it strange to stand here alone tonight with someone who looks exactly like you on these cobblestones? −</t1367> <t1368>I seem to no longer feel that I belong to this world, Charles Darnay replied.</t1368>
<t1369>− I'm not surprised; just recently you almost stepped into the afterlife.</t1369> <t1370>He spoke as if he were out of breath and about to faint.</t1370>
<t1371>− I think I'm about to faint.</t1371>
<t1372>− So why don't you eat something, for heaven's sake? I already ate, I ate while those idiots were debating which world you belong to...</t1372>
<t1373>this side or that side.</t1373> <t1374>Let me show you the nearest pub with good food.</t1374>
<t1375>Linking arms with Darnay, the lawyer led him down Ludgate Hill to Fleet Street and from there, through a covered passageway, into a tavern.</t1375> <t1376>Upon arrival, they were shown into a small room where Charles Darnay immediately regained his strength with a simple yet delicious dinner accompanied by rich wine; meanwhile, Carton sat at the same table opposite him, with his own bottle of port in front of him, and his insolent demeanor became evident once more.</t1376>
<t1377>− Do you now feel that you belong to this earthly realm again, Mr. Darnay?</t1377> <t1378>−</t1378> <t1379>Still disoriented about time and place; but I have recovered enough to perceive them.</t1379>
<t1380>− That feeling must be wonderful! - Carton said bitterly, then poured another full glass of wine; a large glass. - As for me, my greatest desire is to forget that I belong to this world.</t1380> <t1381>It is of no use to me... except for fine wine like this... and I am of no use to it either.</t1381> <t1382>In this respect, you and I are nothing alike.</t1382>
<t1383>In fact, I started to think that we don't have anything in common at all, you and I.</t1383>
<t1384>Confused by the myriad of emotions of the day and feeling as if he were dreaming when faced with the rude individual who shared his appearance, Charles Darnay did not know how to respond; and in the end, he said nothing.</t1384> <t1385>A moment later, Carton continued: −</t1385> <t1386>Now that you have finished your dinner, why not raise a glass to your health, Mr. Darnay?</t1386> <t1387>Why don't you lift your glass and drink to a toast? −</t1387> <t1388>To what health? To what toast? − Oh, you know but just don't want to say.</t1388> <t1389>It must be so, it definitely must be so, I swear to you.</t1389>
<t1390>− Congratulations to Miss Manette! − Congratulations to Miss Manette!</t1390> <t1391>Looking straight at Darnay who was drinking the toast, Carton threw his own glass over his shoulder, the glass shattered against the wall, and then he rang the bell to have another glass brought in.</t1391>
<t1392>− Indeed, a beautiful lady for me to escort to the carriage at night, Mr. Darnay!</t1392> <t1393>- Carton said while filling a new glass.</t1393>
<t1394>A brief frown and a curt "Yes!"</t1394>
<t1395>− Truly a beautiful lady to have her shed tears of pity for me!</t1395> <t1396>How does it feel?</t1396> <t1397>Is it worth risking your life in court to be the object of such compassion and sympathy, Mr. Darnay?</t1397> <t1398>Darnay still did not respond.</t1398>
<t1399>− The young lady was very pleased when she received your message that I delivered.</t1399> <t1400>She didn't show it, but that's what I think.</t1400>
<t1401>That insinuation was a timely reminder for Darnay to recall that this unpleasant friend had proactively helped him in today's predicament.</t1401> <t1402>He steered the conversation in that direction and thanked Carton for conveying the message.</t1402>
<t1403>− I don't need any thanks and I don't expect any repayment, - the indifferent reply. - First of all, this didn't take any effort, and secondly, I don't even understand why I helped.</t1403> <t1404>Mr. Darnay, let me ask you a question.</t1404>
<t1405>− Gladly, as a small token of my appreciation for your help.</t1405>
<t1406>− Do you think I have any affection for you? − Oh, Mr. Carton, - the other replied, strangely puzzled, - I really haven't asked myself that question.</t1406>
<t1407>− So now ask yourself.</t1407>
<t1408>− You acted as if you had affection; but I don't think so.</t1408>
<t1409>− I don't think so either, - Carton said.</t1409> <t1410>- I'm starting to appreciate your intellect now.</t1410>
<t1411>− However, - Darnay continued as he rang the bell to call the waiter, - I hope there is no reason to prevent me from asking for the bill and us parting ways without any animosity.</t1411>
<t1412>− No way! - Carton responded immediately.</t1412> <t1413>Darnay rang the bell.</t1413> <t1414>- You paid for everything? - Carton asked and spoke to the waiter after receiving an affirmative answer.</t1414> <t1415>- Well then, waiter, bring us another bottle of this wine, and wake me up at ten o'clock.</t1415>
<t1416>After paying, Charles Darnay stood up to say goodbye.</t1416> <t1417>Without bothering to say goodbye, Carton also stood up, speaking with a somewhat challenging tone: −</t1417> <t1418>One last word, Mr. Darnay.</t1418> <t1419>Do you think I'm drunk? −</t1419> <t1420>I think you've had quite a bit to drink, Mr. Carton.</t1420>
<t1421>− Think? You know very well that I have drunk a lot.</t1421>
<t1422>− Because I have to say that, but I know.</t1422>
<t1423>− Then you must also know the reason.</t1423> <t1424>I am a lowly servant, sir.</t1424> <t1425>I don't care about anyone in the world, and no one in the world cares about me.</t1425>
<t1426>− It's a pity for you.</t1426> <t1427>You should have used your talent better.</t1427>
<t1428>− Probably so, Mr. Darnay; but not necessarily.</t1428> <t1429>But don't be too quick to rejoice over your composed demeanor, you don't know what lies ahead.</t1429> <t1430>Goodbye! Left alone, this strange man picked up a candle, went to the mirror hanging on the wall, and meticulously examined the reflection in the glass.</t1430>
<t1431>−</t1431> <t1432>Do you have any affection for this person? - Carton mumbled to his own reflection. - Why do you have any affection for someone who resembles you?</t1432> <t1433>You have nothing worthy of affection; you know that well.</t1433> <t1434>Ah, you wretched creature!</t1434> <t1435>You have changed yourself so much!</t1435> <t1436>The valid reason to have affection for someone is because that person shows you what you once were, and what you could have become!</t1436> <t1437>If you were in his place, would you be seen with those blue eyes like him, would you be pitied with that compassionate face like him? Come on, speak frankly! You despise that person.</t1437>
<t1438>He again resorted to the bottle to drown his sorrows, finishing it off in just a few minutes, then slumped over his arms and fell asleep, his hair sprawled across the table, and the candle wax dripped down like a shroud covering his head.</t1438>
<t1439>5.</t1439> <t1440>Jackal*</t1440>
<t1441>It was an era of wine, and most men drank like fish.</t1441> <t1442>Time has improved that vice to the extent that nowadays, one would be considered ridiculously exaggerated if they mentioned the average amount of wine and punch a person of that time could consume in one night without damaging the reputation of a noble gentleman.</t1442> <t1443>Compared to other high academic professions, the legal profession was not lacking in its number of heavy drinkers; barrister Stryver, too, having aggressively pushed his way into this lucrative profession, was no less proficient in both the drunkenness and sobriety of the legal breed.</t1443>
<t1444>As a favored person at both the Old Bailey Criminal Court and the Sessions Court, Stryver had begun carefully cutting off the lower rungs of the ladder of fame he was climbing.</t1444> <t1445>The Old Bailey and Sessions courts now had to summon this favored person into their eager embrace; every day one could see Stryver's flushed face, like a sunflower standing out in a garden full of wigs, pushing and shoving to catch the eye of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, competing with other brilliant peers to reach the sun.</t1445>
<t1446>In the previous bar association, people used to notice that although Stryver was eloquent, unscrupulous, cunning, and bold, he lacked the ability to extract the essence from a pile of reports - the most necessary and admirable skill in the achievements of a barrister.</t1446> <t1447>But this had improved significantly.</t1447> <t1448>The more cases he handled, the better he seemed to get at digging to the core of the matter; and even if he spent the entire night carousing with Sydney Carton, by morning this barrister still had all the arguments ready for defense in court.</t1448>
<t1449>Sydney Carton - the most idle and useless person - was actually Stryver's right-hand man. The amount of alcohol these two consumed together, if accumulated from the beginning of the year to the end, would surely be enough to flow like a river.</t1449> <t1450>There was no trial, anywhere, of Stryver's without Carton being there, hands in pockets, eyes fixed on the ceiling; they followed the circuit court together, and wherever they went, they extended their habitual all-night drinking sessions, and it was rumored that in the morning Carton would be seen sneaking, staggering back to the inn like a chased cat.</t1450> <t1451>Eventually, those who cared about this matter gradually came to know that although Sydney Carton would never be a lion, he was an extraordinarily skilled jackal, and it was he who prepared all the legal matters for Stryver in that humble role.</t1451>
<t1452>− Sir, it's ten o'clock, - said the servant whom Carton had entrusted with the task of waking him, - it's ten o'clock, sir.</t1452>
<t1453>− What's the matter? - Sir, it's ten o'clock already.</t1453>
<t1454>− What do you mean? Ten o'clock at night? −</t1454> <t1455>Yes, sir.</t1455> <t1456>The gentleman instructed me to call.</t1456>
<t1457>− Ah! I remember now.</t1457> <t1458>Very good, very good.</t1458>
<t1459>After several feeble attempts to go back to sleep but being skillfully awakened by the attendant who kept stoking the fireplace continuously for five minutes, Carton got up, put his hat on, and went out.</t1459> <t1460>He turned towards the Temple area, after twice circling around to fully wake up on the sidewalk between King’s Bench Walk and Paper Buildings, he entered the office of barrister Stryver.</t1460>
<t1461>The secretary of Stryver - who never attended these meetings - had gone home, and Stryver himself opened the door.</t1461> <t1462>Stryver was wearing slippers, a loose dressing gown, and his collar was open for comfort.</t1462> <t1463>Around his eyes were the clear signs of tension, the ferocity commonly seen in every indulgent person in the legal profession, from Jeffries* to the present, which one can trace through the various portraits disguised as art from the era that worshipped Bacchus.</t1463>
<t1464>− You arrived a bit late, Mr. Memory, - Stryver said.</t1464>
<t1465>− Just like usual; probably about half an hour late.</t1465>
<t1466>They entered a filthy room, filled with books and cluttered with papers, where a fireplace was blazing and a kettle was steaming on the stove.</t1466> <t1467>And amidst that forest of papers, a table laden with wine, spirits, rum with sugar and lemon was revealed.</t1467>
<t1468>− I'm sure you've already had a bottle, Sydney.</t1468>
<t1469>− Two bottles tonight, probably.</t1469> <t1470>Earlier, I had dinner with the client from today's trial; or more accurately, I watched him eat... same difference! −</t1470> <t1471>Sydney, it's truly extraordinary that you put yourself forward for identification.</t1471> <t1472>How did you come up with that idea?</t1472> <t1473>When did you notice the resemblance? −</t1473> <t1474>I think he's quite a handsome guy, and I think I might have turned out like him if I had been lucky.</t1474>
<t1475>Stryver laughed, shaking his already corpulent belly.</t1475>
<t1476>− You got lucky, Sydney!</t1476> <t1477>Alright, get to work, get to work.</t1477>
<t1478>With a gloomy face, the Jackal loosened his tie and took off his coat, went to the next room, and returned with a jug of cold water, a basin, and some towels.</t1478> <t1479>He dipped the towel in water, wrung it out, folded the wet towel, and haphazardly placed it on his head, then sat at the table, saying: −</t1479> <t1480>I'm ready! − Tonight, there's not much work, Mr. Memory, - Stryver said cheerfully while looking through the papers.</t1480>
<t1481>− How many files? −</t1481> <t1482>There are only two.</t1482>
<t1483>− Give me the hardest one.</t1483>
<t1484>− Here, Sydney.</t1484> <t1485>Do it now!</t1485> <t1486>The Lion then settled back on a sofa placed beside the liquor table, while on the other side was the Jackal sitting at a separate table cluttered with papers but still within reach of bottles and glasses.</t1486> <t1487>Both freely used the liquor table but in their own ways;</t1487> <t1488>The Lion usually lay on his back, hands hooked into his waistband, eyes gazing at the fireplace or occasionally flipping through a simple file; the Jackal furrowed his brow, deeply immersed in work, his eyes not even following his hand as it reached for a glass - the hand often groped for a minute or more before finding the glass to bring to his lips.</t1488> <t1489>Two or three times, when the problem at hand became too difficult, the Jackal had to get up and wet his towel again.</t1489> <t1490>After each pilgrimage to the water jug and basin, the Jackal returned with the wet towels draped over his head in an indescribably peculiar manner; looking even more absurd with his serious and tense expression.</t1490>
<t1491>Finally, the Jackal managed to gather a full meal to offer to the Lion.</t1491> <t1492>The Lion carefully received it, meticulously selecting the meat from the bones, and made comments to the Jackal.</t1492> <t1493>When the meal had been thoroughly consumed in this manner, the Lion hooked his hands into his waistband and lay down to ponder.</t1493> <t1494>The Jackal then restored his strength with a full glass of wine poured down his throat, a fresh wet cloth applied to his head, and continued to prepare the second meal; this meal was again offered to the Lion as before, and only fully digested when the clock struck three in the morning.</t1494>
<t1495>− Now that the work is done, have a glass of punch, Sydney, - Stryver said.</t1495>
<t1496>The jackal removed the cloths that had been steaming from its head, stretched, yawned, shivered, and then followed suit.</t1496>
<t1497>− Sydney, you were really impressive in handling the witnesses accusing you today.</t1497> <t1498>Every question was worthwhile.</t1498>
<t1499>− Aren't I always good? −</t1499> <t1500>I don't deny that.</t1500> <t1501>What made you so angry?</t1501> <t1502>Have another drink to cool down.</t1502>
<t1503>Muttering complaints, the Jackal still obeyed.</t1503>
<t1504>− The guy Sydney Carton from the old days at Shrewsbury school, Stryver said while nodding as he compared his friend from the past to the present, - the teetering Sydney!</t1504> <t1505>One moment he's up, the next he's down; sometimes he's enthusiastic, other times he's despondent! −</t1505> <t1506>Ah! - The friend sighed in response. - Yes! That same Sydney, with the same bad luck.</t1506> <t1507>Even back then, I used to do homework for my classmates but rarely did my own.</t1507>
<t1508>− Why didn't you do it? − Only God knows, I guess that's just how I am.</t1508>
<t1509>He sat with his legs stretched out in front of him, hands in his pockets, eyes fixed on the fireplace.</t1509>
<t1510>- Carton, if you keep going like this, you won't get anywhere, just like in the past.</t1510> <t1511>- Stryver aggressively stood right in front of him with an overbearing attitude, as if the fireplace was a forge of relentless efforts, and the only thing needed to be done for the old Sydney Carton from Shrewsbury school was to throw him into that fire. - You have no motivation and no purpose.</t1511> <t1512>Look at me.</t1512>
<t1513>− Oh, what a bother! - Sydney replied with a cheerful and somewhat enthusiastic laugh.</t1513> <t1514>- You, teaching me a lesson! −</t1514> <t1515>How did I achieve what I have? - Stryver said.</t1515> <t1516>- How did I do what I wanted? −</t1516> <t1517>Partly because you paid me to help you, I suppose.</t1517> <t1518>But don't bother calling me that way and don't act superior to me; do whatever you want.</t1518> <t1519>You always charge ahead, while I always stay behind.</t1519>
<t1520>− I have to push to the front; it's not like I was born into a prestigious family. −</t1520> <t1521>I wasn't there when you were born; but I know you are prestigious, - Carton said.</t1521> <t1522>After finishing his sentence, he laughed and Stryver laughed along.</t1522>
<t1523>Carton continued.</t1523> <t1524>"Before attending Shrewsbury, while at Shrewsbury, and after leaving Shrewsbury, you were always ahead, while I was always behind."</t1524> <t1525>"Even when we were both students in the Latin Quarter in Paris, learning French, studying French law, and other trivial French matters that seemed useless, you always stood out, while I remained obscure."</t1525>
<t1526>− So whose fault is it? −</t1526> <t1527>Deep down, I also think it's your fault.</t1527> <t1528>You are always trying to compete, scramble, and maneuver to get ahead, doing it so continuously that I have no other choice but to sit quietly and let my intellect go to waste.</t1528>
<t1529>But it's almost dawn, and talking about the past is very boring.</t1529>
<t1530>Change the subject before I get back.</t1530>
<t1531>− That's good!</t1531> <t1532>Let's toast to that beautiful witness, - Stryver said, raising his glass.</t1532> <t1533>- Do you agree with this topic?</t1533> <t1534>Clearly not, as Carton became sullen again.</t1534>
<t1535>− Beautiful witness, - he muttered, eyes looking down at his glass of wine.</t1535> <t1536>- All day and night I've run into so many witnesses; who is your beautiful witness? −</t1536> <t1537>The charming daughter of the doctor, Miss Manette.</t1537>
<t1538>− Is she beautiful? −</t1538> <t1539>Isn't she beautiful? −</t1539> <t1540>No.</t1540>
<t1541>− Oh my goodness, the whole Court is admiring her! −</t1541> <t1542>Nonsense, the whole Court is admiring her! Who turned the Old Bailey into a beauty pageant? −</t1542> <t1543>She's just a blonde doll! −</t1543> <t1544>Do you know, Sydney? - Stryver said, eyes fixed on Carton and slowly running his hand over his flushed face.</t1544> <t1545>- Do you know, during the trial I thought you had a thing for that blonde doll, so you immediately noticed what happened to that doll girl.</t1545>
<t1546>− Immediately see what happened!</t1546> <t1547>Whether it's a doll or not, if a girl faints right in front of a man, just one or two yards away, he would see it without needing a telescope.</t1547> <t1548>I drink to your health, not to your beauty.</t1548> <t1549>Now I won't drink any more, I'm going to sleep.</t1549>
<t1550>When the host escorted Carton all the way to the stairs, holding a candle to light his way down, the cold daylight shone through the dirty windows.</t1550> <t1551>When he left the house, the weather was bleak and cold, the clouds hung low and gray, the river was dim and gloomy, and the whole scene resembled a dead desert.</t1551> <t1552>Dust swirled, swirled like a mourning wreath in the early wind, as if the desert sand had risen in the distance, and the first wave of sand had come to bury the city.</t1552>
<t1553>Inner strength exhausted and surrounded by desert, that person stops and stands still on a quiet street corner, suddenly seeing in the desolate expanse ahead the mirage of a lofty aspiration, selfless sacrifice, and steadfast perseverance. In that beautiful, illusory city are the airy verandas where love and compassion gaze upon him, the gardens where the fruits of life ripen, and the streams where hope sparkles in the eyes.</t1553>
<t1554>Just a moment and the illusion vanished.</t1554> <t1555>Climbing up to a high room in a crowded building, he kept his clothes on and threw himself onto the crumpled bed, his pillow soaked with tears of regret.</t1555>
<t1556>Sadness, sadness, the sun rises; the bright sun illuminates a scene where nothing is more sorrowful than a person full of talent and goodwill who cannot find direction in life, cannot rise to create their own happiness, aware of the impending adversity yet still letting life wither away.</t1556>
<t1557>6.</t1557> <t1558>Group after group</t1558>
<t1559>The quiet house of Dr. Manette was located on a quiet street not far from Soho Square.</t1559> <t1560>On a beautiful Sunday afternoon, when the waves of time had swept away the memories of the treason trial four months earlier into the sea of public oblivion, Mr. Jarvis Lorry strolled along the sunlit streets from his home in Clerkenwell to Dr. Manette's house for dinner.</t1560> <t1561>After several instances of being habitually engrossed in his work, Mr. Lorry had grown close to the doctor, and this quiet corner had become a bright part of his life.</t1561>
<t1562>That beautiful Sunday afternoon, Mr. Lorry took a walk to Soho quite early for three familiar reasons.</t1562> <t1563>First, because on beautiful Sunday afternoons, he usually took a walk with the doctor and Lucie before the meal; second, because on Sundays with bad weather, he was accustomed to visiting like a family member, chatting, reading, watching the scenery outside the window, to pass the time; third, because he happened to have a bit of a difficult matter to resolve, and he was so familiar with the doctor's family that he knew this was the best time to think.</t1563>
<t1564>In London, there is no street corner better than the corner of Dr. Manette's house.</t1564> <t1565>It is a cul-de-sac, and from the front windows of this house, one can overlook a serene little street that is very suitable for a reclusive lifestyle.</t1565> <t1566>At that time, there were still few houses north of Oxford Street, so tall trees grew like a forest, wildflowers bloomed everywhere, and hawthorn flowers flourished on the vacant lands that are now gone.</t1566> <t1567>Therefore, the countryside wind freely rushed into the spacious Soho area, not sluggish like a homeless beggar wandering into the parish*; not far to the south, the peach trees with supports would bear ripe fruit every season.</t1567>
<t1568>The summer sun shines on this corner of the street from early morning; but as the roads gradually heat up, this corner remains in the shade, though not so shaded as to be glaring when looking out into the sunlight.</t1568> <t1569>It is a cool, quiet, yet cheerful place, a perfect spot for reminiscing; truly a haven away from the storms of the city streets.</t1569>
<t1570>In such a harbor, there must be a peaceful ship to shelter, and indeed there was.</t1570> <t1571>Dr. Manette's house occupied two floors in a large, solid building, surrounded by many professional establishments during the day, though hardly a sound was heard, and at night, all was quiet.</t1571> <t1572>Across a courtyard rustling with the sound of sycamore leaves was a house with a shop inside that made church organs, silverware, and even gilding; on the wall of this house, right in front of the main door, instead of a signboard, there was a large golden arm symbol, as if some mysterious giant inside had gilded his entire body and thrust his arm out to the street, threatening to turn all passersby into precious metals.</t1572> <t1573>Rarely were the faces or voices of these craftsmen seen or heard, nor those of the lodger rumored to live upstairs, or the dark-faced fellow who upholstered carriage seats and insisted he had a shop on the ground floor.</t1573> <t1574>Occasionally, a stray worker in a coat would pass through the hall, or a stranger would appear, occasionally the faint clinking sound could be heard from across the courtyard, or the thumping of the golden giant.</t1574> <t1575>But these were exceptions that proved the rule that from Sunday morning to Saturday night, the place was dominated by the birds in the sycamore trees behind the house and the quiet echoes of the street corner in front.</t1575>
<t1576>This is where Doctor Manette received a few patients who came to him due to his former reputation, which has now been restored thanks to rumors spreading about his imprisonment.</t1576> <t1577>His professional knowledge, along with his meticulousness and ability to conduct skillful experiments, also brought in more work, allowing the doctor to make a living.</t1577>
<t1578>These understandings, thoughts, and observations occupied Mr. Jarvis Lorry's mind as he rang the doorbell of the quiet house on this corner street on a beautiful Sunday afternoon.</t1578>
<t1579>− Is Dr. Manette home?</t1579> <t1580>He is about to come home.</t1580>
<t1581>− Is Miss Lucie home?</t1581> <t1582>She is about to come home.</t1582>
<t1583>− Is Miss Pross at home?</t1583> <t1584>Probably, but the maid couldn't possibly know Miss Pross's intentions, so she neither denied nor confirmed.</t1584>
<t1585>− Because this is like my home too, I will go upstairs, - Mr. Lorry said.</t1585>
<t1586>Though the doctor's daughter knew nothing about her native country, she seemed to have inherently inherited from her father's homeland the ability to adapt maximally under minimal conditions - one of the most useful and admirable traits of the French. The furniture in the house, though simple, was compensated by many small decorative items that, while not valuable, were elegant and pleasing to the eye, making them very interesting.</t1586> <t1587>The arrangement of everything in the rooms, from the largest to the smallest items; the combination of colors, the subtle contrasts and diversity achieved by making the most of inexpensive items, thanks to skillful hands, a keen eye, and aesthetic sense, attracted the eye while revealing the person who created this setting to such an extent that, when Mr. Lorry looked around, it seemed as if the tables and chairs were silently asking with the same distinctive expression as the familiar wrinkles on Lucie's forehead: Are you satisfied?</t1587> <t1588>Each floor of the house had three rooms, with the doors wide open to let the fresh air in, and as Mr. Lorry moved from room to room, he delighted in noticing the resemblance between the furniture and the owner evident all around.</t1588> <t1589>The first room was the most beautiful, containing Lucie's belongings such as a birdcage, vases, books, a writing desk, a sewing table, and a watercolor box; the second room was the doctor's consulting room, which also served as the dining room; the third room was the doctor's bedroom, where sunlight spots continuously danced through the rustling branches of the plane tree outside, and here, in a corner, was the shoemaker's bench and untouched tool tray, just as it had been placed on the fifth floor of the eerie house next to the tavern in the suburbs of Saint Antoine in Paris.</t1589>
<t1590>His eyes stopped at that bench, Mr. Lorry said to himself: − Why does he keep this? To remember those painful times? −</t1590> <t1591>Understand for what? - The sudden question startled him.</t1591>
<t1592>It was the voice of Miss Pross, the strong-armed, red-haired woman he had first met at the Royal George Hotel in Dover, who had since become familiar.</t1592>
<t1593>- I thought...</t1593> <t1594>- Mr. Lorry began.</t1594>
<t1595>− Shh! Nonsense! - Miss Pross exclaimed and Mr. Lorry left his sentence unfinished.</t1595> <t1596>- How are you? - She continued, her tone gruff but clearly without any ill will towards him.</t1596>
<t1597>− Thank you, I am very well, - Mr. Lorry replied, humbly, - and how are you? −</t1597> <t1598>It's a miserable life, - Ms. Pross replied.</t1598>
<t1599>− Really? − Ah! Of course, really! - said Miss Pross.</t1599> <t1600>- I'm quite upset about our dear mistress here.</t1600>
<t1601>− Really? −</t1601> <t1602>For heaven's sake, say something else instead of "really," you're driving me crazy, - Miss Pross, tall in stature but short on patience.</t1602>
<t1603>− Oh, really? - Mr. Lorry adjusted.</t1603>
<t1604>− "Is that so," it's not great, - Miss Pross replied, - but it's better than nothing.</t1604> <t1605>That's right, I'm quite annoyed myself.</t1605>
<t1606>− May I ask the reason? −</t1606> <t1607>− I don't like a bunch of unworthy people coming here to gawk at the dear mistress, - said Miss Pross.</t1607>
<t1608>− A dozen people came to gawk? −</t1608> <t1609>Hundreds, actually, - replied Miss Pross.</t1609>
<t1610>Like many others before and after her, she had a habit of immediately exaggerating her claims when someone doubted them.</t1610>
<t1611>− Poor thing! - That was the safest remark Mr. Lorry could think of.</t1611>
<t1612>− I have lived with the mistress...</t1612> <t1613>- Miss Pross chattered on, - or the mistress has lived with me and paid for my living since she was ten; indeed, the mistress should never have paid me, I swear to you, if only I could support myself or support her without needing a salary.</t1613> <t1614>It's really too hard!</t1614> <t1615>Not understanding exactly what was too hard, Mr. Lorry could only shake his head, using that important body part as a magical mask capable of expressing all emotions.</t1615>
<t1616>− A whole bunch of people who aren't worthy at all of the dear mistress keep showing up, - said Miss Pross.</t1616> <t1617>- Ever since he caused the trouble...</t1617>
<t1618>− Did I cause this, Miss Pross? −</t1618> <t1619>Who else? Who brought the master’s father back to life? − Oh! If that was caused by me then... - Mr. Lorry said.</t1619>
<t1620>− So it hasn't ended yet, is that what you mean? Let me tell you, when you caused the trouble, it was already bad enough; it's not that I'm blaming Dr. Manette, it's just that he doesn't deserve to have such a daughter, and this isn't his fault either, because in this situation, how could anyone know who deserves what.</t1620> <t1621>But it's twice, three times as painful when wave after wave of people keep coming to see the doctor; well, I can overlook him; just to end up taking away my beloved mistress.</t1621>
<t1622>Mr. Lorry knew that Miss Pross had a very jealous nature, but by now he also understood that beneath this peculiar exterior was a person who was not at all self-centered—a trait only seen in women—who, out of love and admiration, would willingly become a slave to the youth she had lost, to the beauty she never possessed, to the achievements she unfortunately never attained, and to the bright hopes that never once shone into her own bleak life.</t1622> <t1623>He understood life well enough to know that nothing surpasses the loyal service that comes from the heart, devoted and free from any self-interest, to the extent that he had to respect Miss Pross. In the mental hierarchy of respect he had arranged in his mind—which we all do to some extent—he awarded her a position close to the angels, far above many ladies of superior social standing, education, and with money deposited at Tellson's Bank.</t1623>
<t1624>− Before or after, it has always been the same, there is only one person who truly deserves the beloved mistress, - said Miss Pross.</t1624> <t1625>- That is my brother Solomon, if only his life had not made mistakes.</t1625>
<t1626>Additionally: Mr. Lorry had investigated Miss Pross's past and confirmed that her brother Solomon was a heartless scoundrel who had stripped his sister of all her assets to use as capital for speculation, leaving her to live in poverty for the rest of her life without a shred of remorse.</t1626> <t1627>It was because Miss Pross had unwavering faith in Solomon (considering his minor faults as trivial) that Mr. Lorry respected and always thought well of her.</t1627>
<t1628>− By the way, now it's just you and me, and we are both people of work, - he said when they had returned to the living room and were chatting amicably.</t1628> <t1629>- I ask you... did the doctor, when talking to Lucie, ever mention the time he made shoes? −</t1629> <t1630>Not at all.</t1630>
<t1631>− Does he still keep that bench with the tools next to him? − Oh! - Miss Pross replied, shaking her head. - But I didn't say that he doesn't remind himself silently.</t1631>
<t1632>− Do you think he thinks a lot about that? −</t1632> <t1633>Yes, - replied Ms. Pross.</t1633>
<t1634>− So, can you imagine...</t1634> <t1635>- Mr. Lorry had just started to speak when Miss Pross interrupted him.</t1635>
<t1636>− Imagining things again!</t1636> <t1637>I never imagine anything at all.</t1637>
<t1638>− I was wrong; do you suppose that... ah, surely you must suppose something occasionally? −</t1638> <t1639>Occasionally, - said Miss Pross.</t1639>
<t1640>− Did you suppose, - Mr. Lorry continued, his eyes sparkling with joy as he looked at her appreciatively, - that Dr. Manette might know something about the reason for his oppression, even the name of his oppressor, and that he has kept it secret all these years? −</t1640> <t1641>I don't suppose anything about this, but the dear mistress told me exactly the same.</t1641>
<t1642>− Meaning...? − It means the lady thinks he knows.</t1642>
<t1643>− Don't get angry when I ask these questions; because I am just a clumsy worker, while you are the person of the job.</t1643>
<t1644>− Clumsy? - Miss Pross calmly asked back.</t1644>
<t1645>− No, no, no, - Mr. Lorry wanted to remove that modest adjective. - Certainly not.</t1645> <t1646>Alright, let's get back to work...</t1646> <t1647>Are you surprised that Dr. Manette never mentioned it, even though it's clear he didn't commit any crime, as we all know for sure?</t1647> <t1648>It's not necessary for the doctor to tell me, even though he and I have had a working relationship for many years and are now friends; I mean to tell his lovely daughter whom the doctor loves very much and who also loves her father? Believe me, Miss Pross, I bring this up not out of curiosity but out of deep concern for the doctor.</t1648>
<t1649>− Ah! The thing I know best, though not very well, you see, - said Ms. Pross in a lowered voice as if to justify herself, - is that the doctor is afraid of this whole matter.</t1649>
<t1650>− Afraid? − It's an understandable reason, I think so.</t1650> <t1651>It's a terribly horrifying reminder.</t1651> <t1652>Moreover, he lost his memory because of that incident.</t1652> <t1653>Not knowing how he lost his memory, nor how he regained it, perhaps he isn't sure that he won't lose it again.</t1653> <t1654>Just that alone is already quite unsettling, I think so.</t1654>
<t1655>An insightful remark beyond Mr. Lorry's expectations. He said: − Yes, and afraid to think about the past.</t1655> <t1656>But in my heart, I feel uneasy, Miss Pross, wondering if it's good for Dr. Manette to always keep things hidden and not speak out.</t1656> <t1657>Honestly, it's because of this worry that I often feel uncomfortable, so now I'm telling you.</t1657>
<t1658>− That's the way it is, said Miss Pross, shaking her head.</t1658> <t1659>- When it comes to that, he turns pale and feels sick immediately.</t1659> <t1660>It's best to leave it alone.</t1660> <t1661>In short, it must be left alone, whether we like it or not.</t1661> <t1662>Sometimes in the middle of the night, he wakes up and we hear him pacing back and forth, back and forth in his room upstairs.</t1662> <t1663>Her dear mistress knows that her father's mind is pacing back and forth, back and forth in the old prison.</t1663> <t1664>She hurriedly runs up, and then the father and daughter pace back and forth, back and forth together until he calms down.</t1664>
<t1665>But he did not say a word to his daughter about the reason for his unease, and she thought it best not to bring it up with him.</t1665>
<t1666>The two people kept walking back and forth together, walking back and forth together, until her love and companionship calmed him down.</t1666>
<t1667>No matter how much Miss Pross denied her imagination, the sense of the suffering of someone tormented endlessly by a sorrowful event was revealed in the way she repeated the phrase "going back and forth," proving that she was not devoid of imagination.</t1667>
<t1668>As mentioned above, this street corner is a wonderful place for reminiscing; this place has begun to echo the approaching footsteps, as if resonating with the weary rhythm of comings and goings that Ms. Pross just described.</t1668>
<t1669>− They are back! - Miss Pross said as she stood up, interrupting the conversation. - Now we will see a hundred people coming right away! This corner of the street has a peculiar acoustic feature, like an eardrum that amplifies all sounds to the extent that Mr. Lorry, standing at the wide-open window, could hear the footsteps of the father and daughter but couldn't find them, thinking they would never return.</t1669> <t1670>The echoes not only faded as the footsteps went further away but were followed by the echoes of other footsteps that never arrived, and just when it seemed the footsteps were near, the echoes would vanish forever.</t1670> <t1671>But finally, the father and daughter appeared, and Miss Pross was already standing at the main door to welcome them inside.</t1671>
<t1672>Miss Pross looked fierce, aggressive, and intense, but she was truly endearing when she took off Lucie's bonnet as her beloved mistress went upstairs, then dusted the hat with a few handkerchiefs, set Lucie's cloak aside, and proudly brushed her mistress's magnificent hair as if it were her own and she were the most beautiful and proud woman in the world.</t1672> <t1673>Equally endearing was the sight of Lucie hugging her caretaker in thanks and then playfully protesting that she had gone to too much trouble for her beloved mistress - Lucie only dared to protest in a joking manner, otherwise Miss Pross would be hurt and retreat to her room to cry.</t1673> <t1674>The doctor also seemed pleased as he watched the scene, telling Miss Pross that she spoiled Lucie too much, with a tone and look that were just as indulgent as the caretaker's, and if he could, he would spoil her even more.</t1674> <t1675>Mr. Lorry was also pleased, his face brightening under his wig, and he silently thanked his solitary fate for leading him to find a family in his later years.</t1675> <t1676>But not seeing hundreds of people flocking to gawk, Mr. Lorry waited in vain, as Miss Pross's prediction did not come true.</t1676>
<t1677>It's mealtime, yet there's no sign of any groups arriving.</t1677>
<t1678>In the organization of this small family, the kitchen work was handled by Miss Pross, and she managed everything perfectly on her own.</t1678> <t1679>Although not luxurious, the meals she cooked were very skillfully prepared and beautifully presented, with dishes that were a delicate blend of English and French styles, extremely delicious.</t1679> <t1680>Very practically, Miss Pross expressed her affection through her culinary skills, scouring Soho and the surrounding areas to find impoverished French expatriates, enticing them with shillings and half-crowns to share their cooking secrets.</t1680> <t1681>From these sons and daughters of Gaul, she learned wonderful cooking tips, to the extent that the two maids, one old and one young, in the house saw her as nothing short of a witch or the fairy godmother of Cinderella - who would have them bring back a chicken, a rabbit, or some garden vegetables and transform them into anything she wished.</t1681>
<t1682>On Sundays, Miss Pross would sit and eat with the doctor and his daughter, but on other days she insisted on having her meals at times nobody knew, either in the kitchen or in her private room on the second floor - a blue room that only her beloved mistress was allowed to enter.</t1682> <t1683>But today, Miss Pross delighted in showing off all her skills to pamper her beloved and graceful mistress, so the meal was also excellent.</t1683>
<t1684>It was a sweltering day, so after the meal, Lucie suggested everyone take the wine out under the plane tree to enjoy the cool breeze.</t1684> <t1685>Since everyone was interested and agreed with her suggestion, they all went out there, and she personally brought a glass of wine for Mr. Lorry.</t1685> <t1686>Lucie had long taken on the role of wine bearer for Mr. Lorry; as everyone chatted under the plane tree, she never let his glass run dry.</t1686>
<t1687>The walls of the surrounding houses watched them converse, while the branches of the weeping willow above them whispered to them.</t1687>
<t1688>Even so, no groups or crowds were seen.</t1688> <t1689>Darnay arrived while they were relaxing, but he was the only one.</t1689>
<t1690>Dr. Manette warmly welcomed this guest, and so did Lucie.</t1690>
<t1691>But Miss Pross suddenly contorted her face and body and retreated into the house.</t1691>
<t1692>She was often tormented by this condition, and in intimate conversations, she referred to it as "having a fit."</t1692>
<t1693>The doctor is in excellent health and looks much younger.</t1693> <t1694>At times like these, he resembles Lucie a lot, and when the two sit next to each other, the girl leaning on her father's shoulder, and he resting his arm on the back of her chair, it's delightful to see their similar faces.</t1694> <t1695>He has been talking non-stop about various topics with an unusual liveliness.</t1695>
<t1696>− Doctor Manette, - Darnay spoke up as they sat under the tree, joining in on the topic that had come up by chance about the old buildings of London, - have you visited the Tower of London yet? −</t1696> <t1697>Lucie and I have been there; but only briefly.</t1697> <t1698>We haven't seen everything, but enough to know that the tower is full of interesting things, that's all.</t1698>
<t1699>− I have been there already, as you know, - Darnay said with a smile, though his face reddened slightly with a hint of irritation at the memory, I stayed longer even though I didn't get to see everything. While I was there, I heard a strange story.</t1699>
<t1700>− What's going on? - Lucie asked.</t1700>
<t1701>− When repairing some parts of the tower, a group of workers accidentally discovered an old dungeon, built many years ago and forgotten.</t1701> <t1702>Every stone of the inner wall was covered with writings carved by prisoners... dates, names, complaints, and prayers.</t1702> <t1703>On a cornerstone in a corner of the dungeon, a prisoner who seemed to have been executed had carved his final words, just three letters.</t1703>
<t1704>These words were hastily carved by a trembling hand and a worn-out tool.</t1704> <t1705>At first, people read the three letters as D. A. C.; but upon closer inspection, the last letter was actually an O.</t1705> <t1706>There were no records or notes of a prisoner with such initials, and people kept guessing without knowing whose name those letters stood for.</t1706> <t1707>Eventually, it was concluded that the letters were not initials but a complete word, ĐÀO.</t1707>
<t1708>They carefully examined the dungeon floor right below the inscription, and in the soil beneath a stone, or a brick, or some kind of tile, were the ashes of a piece of paper mixed with the ashes of a small leather box or pouch.</t1708> <t1709>It was never possible to read what the prisoner had written on the paper, but it was certain that they had written something and hidden it from the jailer.</t1709>
<t1710>− Dad, - Lucie exclaimed, - you're sick!</t1710> <t1711>The doctor suddenly started, raising a hand to his head.</t1711> <t1712>His expression and demeanor terrified everyone.</t1712>
<t1713>− No, child, I'm not sick.</t1713> <t1714>A few large raindrops fell and startled me.</t1714> <t1715>We should go inside.</t1715>
<t1716>He calmed down almost instantly.</t1716> <t1717>Indeed, there was heavy rain falling, and he held out the back of his hand to show the droplets of water.</t1717> <t1718>But he said nothing about the newly recounted discovery, and as everyone went inside, Mr. Lorry's professional eye either recognized, or thought it recognized, the expression on the doctor's face when he turned to look at Darnay, flashing the very same look Manette had when he saw the prisoner in the courtroom corridor a few months earlier.</t1718>
<t1719>But Dr. Manette calmed down so quickly that Mr. Lorry began to doubt his professional eye.</t1719> <t1720>The arm of the golden giant on the wall could not be steadier than the demeanor of the doctor when he stopped right under that symbol and told everyone that he was still easily startled (and probably would remain so), it was the raindrops that had startled him.</t1720>
<t1721>When it was time for tea, Miss Pross was making tea when she had another fit, but there were no crowds or anything.</t1721> <t1722>Only Carton wandered in, and he was the second person.</t1722>
<t1723>The darker the sky became, the more stifling it got to the point where everyone sitting around, with both the main door and windows wide open, still felt the oppressive heat.</t1723> <t1724>When the tea session was over, everyone moved to a window that looked out onto the dim and gloomy scene outside.</t1724>
<t1725>Lucie sat next to her father; Darnay stood beside her; Carton leaned against a window.</t1725>
<t1726>The long, white curtains, caught in the stormy wind, rushed into this corner of the street only to be blown back up, fluttering like ghostly wings.</t1726>
<t1727>− The rain is still falling heavily but sparsely, - said Dr. Manette.</t1727> <t1728>The storm will come.</t1728>
<t1729>− Certainly will come, - Carton said.</t1729>
<t1730>They spoke softly, like people who are watching and waiting; like those who sit in a dark room, always whispering while watching and waiting for a flash of lightning.</t1730>
<t1731>The streets echoed with the hurried voices of people rushing to find shelter before the storm hit; this wonderful corner of the street reverberated with the echoes of footsteps coming and going, yet no one came here.</t1731>
<t1732>− So many people, yet it's still so quiet! - Darnay exclaimed after everyone listened to the echoes for a long time.</t1732>
<t1733>− Strange, isn't it, Mr. Darnay?</t1733> <t1734>- Lucie said.</t1734> <t1735>- Sometimes I sit here all evening until I imagine that... oh, but even that little bit of silly imagination makes me shiver tonight, when everything around is so dark and gloomy...</t1735>
<t1736>− Let's be afraid together.</t1736> <t1737>What do you imagine? −</t1737> <t1738>You probably can't picture it.</t1738> <t1739>Those sudden ideas only move the person who thinks of them; they can't be conveyed to others.</t1739> <t1740>Sometimes I sit here alone all evening, listening, until I imagine those echoes are the footsteps that will eventually step into our lives.</t1740>
<t1741>− If so, then my life will one day welcome wave after wave, Sydney Carton added in his familiar melancholic manner.</t1741>
<t1742>The footsteps were unceasing, and those hurried echoes grew more and more intense.</t1742> <t1743>The street corner resonated with the sound of footsteps; at times it seemed right under these windows; at times it seemed right in the room; there were footsteps coming; there were footsteps going; there were footsteps fading away; there were footsteps stopping; all echoed from the distant street and not a single person appeared.</t1743>
<t1744>− Are those footsteps aimed at all of us, or are they aimed at each of us individually, Miss Manette? −</t1744> <t1745>I don't know, Mr. Darnay; I said it was just a silly imagination, but since you asked, I told you.</t1745> <t1746>When I let myself follow that imagination, I was alone, but then I imagined it was the footsteps of those who would come into my life, into my father's life.</t1746>
<t1747>− I will welcome them into my life! - Carton said.</t1747> <t1748>- I will not question or set any conditions.</t1748> <t1749>There will be crowds upon crowds coming towards us, Miss Manette, and I see them...</t1749> <t1750>under this flash of lightning.</t1750> <t1751>- He added a few final words after a flash of lightning illuminated his weary figure leaning against the window.</t1751>
<t1752>− And I hear their voices! - Carton spoke up after a thunderous roar.</t1752> <t1753>They are coming, swift, fierce, and furious! He described the oncoming storm and the rain cut him off because no one could hear anything over the rumbling tempest.</t1753> <t1754>A memorable storm with thunderclaps exploding, water pouring down in torrents, the sky roaring and lightning flashing, and the rain pouring down relentlessly, until the moon appeared at midnight.</t1754>
<t1755>The large bell of Saint Paul's Church tolled once in the clear sky as Mr. Lorry set off back to the Clerkenwell area, accompanied by Jerry, who was wearing boots and holding a lantern.</t1755> <t1756>Between Soho and Clerkenwell, there were deserted stretches of road, and Mr. Lorry, who was wary of robbers, always asked Jerry to escort him home; although, by usual routine, he should have left two hours earlier.</t1756>
<t1757>− I've never seen a night like this, Jerry! - Mr. Lorry said.</t1757> <t1758>- On a stormy night like this, the dead would rise from their graves.</t1758>
<t1759>− I have never seen a night like tonight, sir... and I don't wish to see... see such rain and wind...</t1759> <t1760>- Jerry replied.</t1760>
<t1761>− Goodbye, Mr. Carton, - said the man of business as he bid farewell.</t1761> <t1762>Goodbye, Mr. Darnay.</t1762> <t1763>I wonder if we will ever meet again on a night like this! Perhaps.</t1763> <t1764>Perhaps, look at the crowds of people screaming, rushing, and surging towards them.</t1764>
<t1765>7.</t1765> <t1766>The high-ranking official in the city</t1766>
<t1767>Lord, one of the great ministers in the court, as usual, hosts guests every fortnight in his magnificent mansion in Paris. The lord is in the inner room, the holy of holies, the most sacred place of all sacred places to the worshippers who are in the outer rooms.</t1767> <t1768>The lord is preparing to drink chocolate.</t1768> <t1769>The lord can swallow many things easily, and a few dim-witted people even think he will soon swallow all of France; but the morning chocolate cannot go down the lord's throat without the assistance of four strong men, not counting the cook.</t1769>
<t1770>Correct.</t1770> <t1771>It takes four people, all four dressed in splendid, luxurious clothing, and the leader of this quartet cannot live without having at least two gold watches in his pocket - he competes in the elegant aristocratic style set by the Lord - and it is he who lifts that blessed chocolate to the Lord's lips.</t1771> <t1772>A servant brings the chocolate pot before His Lordship; the second whips the chocolate into a froth with a small tool reserved for this ritual; the third offers the preferred napkin; the fourth (the one with two gold watches) pours the chocolate.</t1772> <t1773>Drinking chocolate without one of the four servants would mean the Lord could not maintain his lofty status under the heavens for all to admire.</t1773> <t1774>His noble coat of arms would be irrevocably tarnished if the chocolate were served disgracefully with only three servants; and if there were only two, he would rather die.</t1774>
<t1775>Last night, the lord attended a small party with an enticing performance by a theater troupe and singers.</t1775> <t1776>Almost every night, he attends some small party with delightful theatrical performances.</t1776> <t1777>He is so refined and sensitive that the theater troupe and singers have influenced his tedious national secrets more than the demands of the entire country of France.</t1777>
<t1778>Fortunately for France, and also fortunately for any kingdom that has that privilege!</t1778> <t1779>And it is also fortunate for England, for example, during the reign of the Pleasure-Loving Emperor.*</t1779> <t1780>He had a truly lofty ideal about public affairs, which was to let things be as they may; regarding private affairs, he had another lofty ideal that everything must go his way - taking care of his power and purse, regarding pleasures, both public and private, the Lord had another lofty ideal, that life is meant to be enjoyed.</t1780> <t1781>He took the phrase from the Bible "The earth is the Lord's, and everything in it" as a motto for the high officials and just replaced "the Lord" with "the Lordship." However, the Lord gradually found that many unpleasant mundane things had crept into his great affairs, both public and private; and for both of these great affairs, he had to ally with a lowly tax collector.*</t1781> <t1782>Regarding public finances, he knew nothing and had to rely on someone knowledgeable; regarding private finances, after many generations of excessive extravagance, he himself gradually became impoverished and thus needed the very wealthy tax collectors.</t1782> <t1783>Therefore, the Lordship timely pulled his sister out of the convent before she could don the nun's veil awaiting the cheapest attire - and bestowed her like a treasure upon a wealthy but lowly tax collector.</t1783> <t1784>This tax collector, holding a staff topped with a golden apple befitting his status, was currently sitting with guests in the outer room, flaunting himself for humanity to bow and bend - only the superior humanity of the Lordship's lineage, including his wife, always held him in utmost contempt.</t1784>
<t1785>This tax collector is incredibly wealthy.</t1785> <t1786>In his stable, there are thirty horses; in his household, there are twenty-four male servants, and his wife alone has six maids serving her.</t1786> <t1787>Arrogantly claiming to do nothing but plunder and steal whenever possible, this tax collector, though he became noble through marriage - at least, was the most honest person among those present at the Lord's mansion that day.</t1787>
<t1788>Although these rooms, with their luxurious splendor and the most exquisite decorations of the time, were actually not a place of peace when considering the ragged masses elsewhere (not far away, but from the two towers of Notre-Dame Cathedral, one could see both the magnificent mansion and the poor neighborhood almost equidistant); this ragged populace would certainly be a very concerning issue if anyone in the Lord's mansion cared about it, but no one did.</t1788> <t1789>The generals were clueless about military matters; the naval commanders were not familiar with ships; the officials had no idea how to govern; the worst of all were the brazen clergy, with lecherous eyes, deceitful tongues, living even more deceitfully; none were capable of bearing responsibilities, all of them lied shamelessly to match their titles, but all of them, whether near or far, belonged to the high-ranking officials like the Lord, thus being secretly placed in any public office where they could profit from anything; this group numbered in the dozens, not few.</t1789> <t1790>Equally abundant in this mansion were those who had no direct relationship with the Lord or the nation, but also had nothing to do with anything honest, or those who lived their entire lives deceitfully to achieve all sorts of petty goals.</t1790>
<t1791>The group of doctors, getting rich by prescribing all sorts of expensive medications for imaginary diseases that don't actually exist, are smiling at the court patients in the reception rooms of the Lord's mansion.</t1791> <t1792>The group of advisors, who devise all sorts of treatments for trivial national issues but fail to invent serious solutions to eradicate any root cause, are pouring their insane ramblings into the ears of anyone they can catch in the reception rooms of the Lord's mansion.</t1792> <t1793>The group of godless philosophers who want to reform the world with their words and use the card of building a tower against the sky are chatting with the faithless alchemists who want to turn metals into gold in the fascinating gatherings convened by the Lord.</t1793> <t1794>The elite aristocrats - famous then as they are now for their indifference to all the issues that naturally concern humanity - are also in their most typical state of lethargy at the Lord's mansion.</t1794> <t1795>And right within the families of various noble lineages in this elite Parisian society, the spies - who make up half of the courteous guests devotedly gathering at the Lord's mansion - would find it hard to spot among their angelic ladies a wife whose appearance and demeanor indicate she has ever been a mother.</t1795> <t1796>Indeed, apart from bringing into the world a troublesome being - which is not enough to be called motherhood - there is nothing to show that this aristocratic class knows how to be mothers at all.</t1796> <t1797>The peasant wet nurses hide and raise the untimely born infants, while their charming sixty-year-old mistresses dress up like fresh young maidens.</t1797>
<t1798>This artificial substance is like a leprosy that deforms everyone present in the Lord's palace.</t1798> <t1799>In the outer rooms, about half a dozen extraordinary people over the past few years have vaguely feared that the general situation would deteriorate.</t1799>
<t1800>As a prospect to improve the situation, three out of these six people joined the Kinh Phong cult*, and right there they even considered whether they should foam at the mouth; scream loudly and stiffen their bodies on the spot - doing so to gain clairvoyance to guide the future of their lord.</t1800> <t1801>Unlike these epileptic followers; the other three rushed into another sect that specialized in solving problems with a mysterious mantra about the "Center of Truth," which claimed that humans had strayed from the Center of Truth - a point that needed little proof - but had not yet exited the Periphery, and could be pulled back into the Center through fasting and contacting spirits.</t1801> <t1802>Therefore, these three had many discussions with spirits, thanks to which they accomplished many wonderful things that no one ever saw.</t1802>
<t1803>But the pleasant thing is that all the guests in the lord's magnificent mansion are dressed beautifully.</t1803> <t1804>If the Last Judgment were to judge by attire, then everyone here would surely be eternally innocent.</t1804>
<t1805>Behold the curled, powdered, and towering hairstyles; the delicate skin carefully tended to, adorned with powder and lipstick; the majestic swords that captivate the eyes; the exquisite fragrances that honor the sense of smell; these things will surely keep the world forever in motion.</t1805>
<t1806>The distinguished gentlemen, the most elite lineage, wore small dangling jewelry that jingled as they sluggishly shuffled; those golden shackles chimed like precious little bells; and that chiming sound, along with the rustling of silk, tinsel, and fabrics, stirred up a breeze that swept away the image of Saint Antoine and the famine-stricken neighborhood named after that saint.</t1806>
<t1807>Clothing and jewelry are the only effective enchantments to keep everything in its proper place.</t1807> <t1808>Everyone dresses up for a masquerade ball that never ends.</t1808> <t1809>From the Tuileries Palace to the Lord's mansion and the entire court, from the parliaments and courts to the whole society (excluding the ragged poor), this masquerade ball includes even the executioner, who, if he wants to be enchanted, must "curl his hair, sprinkle powder, wear a gold-trimmed coat, dancing shoes, and white silk stockings."</t1809> <t1810>At the gallows and the breaking wheels - rarely using the axe because the axe is reserved for the nobility - the executioner is named by region just as a bishop is named by diocese.</t1810> <t1811>The executioner of Paris, addressed by the executioner of Orleans and his colleagues as the Lord of Paris, also flaunts his power in this elaborate attire.</t1811> <t1812>And who among the guests at the Lord's mansion in 1780 would not believe that an institution anchored by an executioner with curled hair, sprinkled powder, a gold-trimmed coat, dancing shoes, and white silk stockings would not endure longer than the moon and stars! Having finished his chocolate and relieved four servants of their burdens, the Lord ordered all the doors of the most sacred places to be opened and then walked out.</t1812> <t1813>Thus, everyone scrambled to prostrate, scrambled to fawn and flatter; scrambled to bow and scrape; truly humiliating and degrading! Such abject submission of both spirit and body left no room for Heaven - perhaps one of the reasons why the Lord's devotees never bothered to think about it.</t1813>
<t1814>Dispensing promises here, smiles there, condescendingly whispering to some happy slave, then graciously waving to another sycophant, the Lord cheerfully passed through the outer rooms to the farthest area of the Outer Periphery of Truth. Upon reaching here, the Lord turned back and finally retreated to the sanctuary among the chocolate elves, where no one saw him again.</t1814>
<t1815>The display was over, the light breeze had turned into a storm as the precious little bells jingled their way down the stairs.</t1815>
<t1816>In no time, the whole group dwindled to just one person, and this person, with a hat tucked under his arm and a snuffbox in hand, slowly crossed the mirrors and walked out.</t1816> <t1817>This person stopped at the last door on the way out and turned towards the sacred place, uttering a sentence: −</t1817> <t1818>Damn you to hell! After saying this, he shook off the snuff powder from his fingers as if to rid himself of the dust under his feet, then quietly descended the stairs.</t1818>
<t1819>He was around sixty years old, dressed elegantly, with an arrogant demeanor, and his appearance resembled a finely crafted mask.</t1819> <t1820>His face was pale, almost translucent, with well-proportioned and expressive features.</t1820> <t1821>Although his nose was delicate, it was slightly flattened at the nostrils.</t1821> <t1822>Only at the flattened nostrils did his face reveal any slight changes in emotion.</t1822> <t1823>At times, that area would change color, occasionally contracting and expanding as if something was gently pulsating; during those moments, the tip of his nose gave his entire appearance a treacherous and cruel look.</t1823> <t1824>Upon closer inspection, this expression was accentuated by his overly thin and flat mouth and corners of his eyes; nevertheless, his entire face still exuded an overall impression of extraordinary beauty.</t1824>
<t1825>The owner of that face descended the stairs, went out to the yard, got into the carriage, and set off.</t1825> <t1826>During the reception, not many people talked to him; he stood somewhat aloof, and the Lord's attitude towards him was not warm.</t1826> <t1827>In this situation, he seemed more interested in the sight of commoners scattering in panic before the horses and often narrowly escaping harm.</t1827> <t1828>His coachman lashed the horses forward as if attacking an enemy, and this reckless, mad driving did not cause the owner's face or lips to change color in the slightest.</t1828> <t1829>At that time, in this deaf and mute capital, one occasionally heard complaints about the aggressive nobility accustomed to racing their carriages on narrow, sidewalk-less streets, endangering and injuring the common folk without any pity.</t1829> <t1830>But few bothered to think twice about it, and in this matter, as in all others, the wretched commoners were left to fend for themselves.</t1830>
<t1831>Racing madly, recklessly disregarding any sense of propriety in a way that people today cannot comprehend, the carriage sped through the streets, dashed around corners, crashing into screaming women, into men grappling with each other, and swiftly pulling children out of the way.</t1831> <t1832>Finally, as the carriage charged into a corner by the fountain, one of the wheels suddenly jerked up terrifyingly, followed by the loud cries of many people and the horses rearing up wildly.</t1832>
<t1833>If the horses do not stop, this carriage will not stop; usually, the carriage just keeps going, leaving the injured behind, so why stop?</t1833> <t1834>But the servant hastily got off the carriage and twenty hands held the reins tightly.</t1834>
<t1835>− What is happening? - The official calmly looked outside.</t1835>
<t1836>A tall man wearing a hat just lifted a bundle wrapped in cloth from the base of the horses and placed it on the fountain pedestal, then sat down heavily in the mud, howling like a wild beast.</t1836>
<t1837>− Excuse me, Marquis! - A ragged person said humbly.</t1837> <t1838>- Yes, a child.</t1838>
<t1839>− Why is that guy screaming so horribly? Is it his child? −</t1839> <t1840>Sorry, Marquis! - It's really unfortunate... yes, that's right.</t1840>
<t1841>The fountain is located a bit away from the road because the road here leads into an open space of about ten or twelve square yards.</t1841> <t1842>When the tall man stood up and rushed towards the carriage, the Marquis immediately grasped the hilt of his sword.</t1842>
<t1843>− It's dead! - This person screamed, in desperate frenzy, raising both arms straight above his head and glaring at the nobleman. - Dead!</t1843> <t1844>The crowd gathered closer, looking at the Marquis.</t1844> <t1845>The wide-open eyes revealed nothing more than caution and eagerness; there was no sign of threat or anger.</t1845> <t1846>They didn't say a word; after the initial outcry, everything fell silent and remained so.</t1846> <t1847>The voice of the obsequious person from earlier sounded awkward and bland with an utterly servile tone.</t1847>
<t1848>The Marquis rolled his eyes at the crowd as if they were a bunch of rats crawling out of their holes.</t1848>
<t1849>He took out his wallet.</t1849>
<t1850>− I find it very strange, - the Marquis said, - that your common folk do not care for themselves or their children.</t1850> <t1851>One or another of you is always getting in my way.</t1851> <t1852>I wonder if any of you have injured my horses.</t1852> <t1853>Here! Give it to that one.</t1853>
<t1854>He tossed a gold coin for the servant to pick up, and all heads turned, eyes straining to see where the coin would roll.</t1854> <t1855>The tall man let out another boundless, sorrowful scream: "Dead!" He fell silent as the crowd parted for a quick-footed person to approach.</t1855>
<t1856>Seeing this person, the miserable one rested their head on the newcomer's shoulder and sobbed uncontrollably, pointing towards the fountain, where several women were crouching and gently moving around the motionless bundle of cloth.</t1856> <t1857>But they were as silent as the men.</t1857>
<t1858>− I know, I know everything, - the newcomer said.</t1858> <t1859>- Be brave, Gaspard! The poor boy dying like that is better than him living.</t1859> <t1860>He died instantly without any pain.</t1860> <t1861>If he had lived another hour, he might not have been as happy.</t1861>
<t1862>− You there, you truly are a philosopher, - the Marquis said with a smile.</t1862> <t1863>- What is your name? −</t1863> <t1864>My name is Defarge.</t1864>
<t1865>− What is your occupation? − My lord Marquis, I run a tavern.</t1865>
<t1866>− Take it, philosopher bartender, - the Marquis said while tossing another gold coin to the man, - spend it on whatever you want.</t1866>
<t1867>Are those horses okay?</t1867> <t1868>Without bothering to look back at the crowd that had gathered, the Marquis leaned back in his seat; he had just been driven away in a carriage with the nonchalance of a gentleman who had accidentally damaged an item, paid for it, and had plenty of money to spare, when a coin flew into the carriage and clattered onto the floor.</t1868>
<t1869>− Stop! - The Marquis exclaimed. - Stop the horse! Who threw that?</t1869> <t1870>He looked back at the spot where the innkeeper Defarge had been standing, but right there was the wretched father with his face down on the pavement, and behind him stood a dark-skinned woman knitting.</t1870>
<t1871>− You dog! - The Marquis said calmly, his face unchanged except for a spot on the tip of his nose.</t1871> <t1872>- I am very willing to crush any of you and wipe you all off the face of this earth.</t1872> <t1873>If I knew which bastard threw money into the carriage and if that scoundrel were nearby, he would be crushed under these wheels.</t1873>
<t1874>Fully aware of their lowly status and long accustomed to the suffering that a high-ranking official could inflict upon them, regardless of the law, no voice was raised, no hand was lifted, and not even a single glance was directed upwards.</t1874><t1875>Not a single one, among the men.</t1875><t1876>But the woman standing and knitting continued to stare directly at the Marquis.</t1876><t1877>The dignity of the high official did not allow him to notice this; the Marquis’s contemptuous gaze swept over her, over all those rats; then he reclined back in his seat and uttered a word: “Move on!” The carriage moved forward and other carriages rushed by in a convoy behind; the minister’s carriage, the advisor’s carriage, the tax collector’s carriage, the doctor’s carriage, the lawyer’s carriage, the church’s carriage, the theater troupe’s carriage, the colorful masquerade procession all rushed by continuously.</t1877><t1878>The rats had crawled out of their holes to watch, and continued to watch for hours; soldiers and police often stood between the rats and the spectacular procession, but the rats still peeked through the gaps in the human fence.</t1878><t1879>The father had long since disappeared with the bundle of cloth; the women who had tended to the bundle when it lay on the fountain’s pedestal now sat there watching the water flow and the masquerade procession pass by; all the while, only the knitting woman stood prominently, her hands moving swiftly as an immutable fate.</t1879><t1880>The fountain water kept flowing; the river kept rushing; the day quickly turned into night, countless lives in this city rushed towards death as per the law of nature, time waited for no one, the rats huddled together in their dark holes to sleep, the masquerade was resplendent again at dinner time, everything proceeded as usual.</t1880>
<t1881>8.</t1881> <t1882>The high-ranking official in the countryside</t1882>
<t1883>The scenery is beautiful, adorned with the bright colors of fresh cereals, but sparse.</t1883>
<t1884>Many plots of land that should have been used to grow cereals were instead used to grow poor-quality rye, many fields of beans of all kinds of poor quality, and many fields of the worst vegetables replaced wheat.</t1884> <t1885>Like the men, the women who were farming, those insentient beings all exuded an air of reluctantly living, reluctantly existing - a weary intention to let go and wither away.</t1885>
<t1886>The Marquis sat in the carriage drawn by four horses with two coachmen laboriously ascending a steep hill (the carriage should have been lighter).</t1886> <t1887>The reddish hue on the Marquis's face did not betray his noble lineage; it did not come from within but was due to an external factor beyond control - the setting sun.</t1887>
<t1888>The twilight sun shone on the carriage as it rolled up the hill, so bright that it dyed the people inside red.</t1888> <t1889>The Marquis glanced at his hands and exclaimed: −</t1889> <t1890>The sun will set soon.</t1890>
<t1891>Indeed, the sun at that moment was about to set.</t1891> <t1892>When the heavy brake was attached to the wheel and the carriage slid down the hill, that fiery red light quickly dissipated in the smell of scorched sun, in the cloud of dust; the sun disappeared at the same time the Marquis descended the hill and the twilight glow faded as the brake was removed from the wheel.</t1892>
<t1893>But there still remains a countryside with rolling hills stretching far, a small village at the foot of the hill, a wide piece of land and a hill behind, a church bell tower, a windmill, a forest for hunting, a cliff with a fortress used as a prison.</t1893> <t1894>The marquis glanced around at everything that was gradually darkening as night fell here, his face contented like someone about to return to his home.</t1894>
<t1895>The village had a destitute road, with a destitute brewery, a destitute tannery, a destitute inn, a destitute relay station for changing carriage horses, a destitute fountain, and all the familiar destitute amenities.</t1895> <t1896>The village also had destitute people.</t1896> <t1897>All the villagers were destitute, many sitting in front of their doors, chopping the rare onions and similar items for dinner, while many others sat around the fountain washing vegetables and any meager produce that could be harvested from the land.</t1897> <t1898>Everywhere one looked, the cause of their destitution was apparent; taxes for the state, taxes for the church, taxes for the officials, taxes for the local authorities, and taxes for the nation, to be paid here and there, according to the solemn instructions recorded in this small village, to the point where one must wonder if there was any village not consumed by taxes.</t1898>
<t1899>Rarely seen are the shadows of children, and no dogs are seen at all.</t1899> <t1900>For those men and women, their choices in life have been predetermined - to barely survive at the lowest level in this small village beneath the windmill; or to be imprisoned and die in the towering prison on the cliff.</t1900>
<t1901>Heralded by a post rider and the cracking sound of two coachmen's whips, the whips swirling like snakes around the horses' heads in the evening sky, the Marquis entered the village as if escorted by avenging goddesses*.</t1901> <t1902>The traveling carriage stopped in front of the post station next to the fountain, and the peasants paused their work to look up at the nobleman.</t1902> <t1903>The Marquis looked at them, looked without paying any attention to the slow and certain erosion of hunger on those faces and the wretched, emaciated figures - an image that led the English, nearly a hundred years later, to still believe that all French people were as gaunt as that.</t1903>
<t1904>The marquis looked down at the obsequious faces bowing before him, much like men of his kind would bow before superiors at court - except these faces bowed out of misery, not for seeking favor; at that moment, a gray-haired road laborer joined the group.</t1904>
<t1905>− Bring that person over there to see me! - The marquis told the station master.</t1905>
<t1906>Taking off their hats and holding them in their hands, the person was led forward, and the crowd gathered around to look and listen, just like the people at the fountain in Paris.</t1906>
<t1907>− Did we pass by you on the road? −</t1907> <t1908>Yes, sir, that's correct.</t1908> <t1909>I am honored that you passed by me on the road.</t1909>
<t1910>− Even when the car goes uphill and at the top of the hill, right? −</t1910> <t1911>Yes, sir.</t1911>
<t1912>− What have you seen that you are staring so intently? −</t1912> <t1913>Your Excellency, I have seen a person.</t1913>
<t1914>He bent down slightly and pointed the tattered green hat under the car.</t1914> <t1915>Everyone around also bent down to look.</t1915>
<t1916>− Who, you fool? Why are you looking there? −</t1916> <t1917>Begging your pardon, sir; it's hanging on the chain of the claw... of the brake, sir.</t1917>
<t1918>− Who? - The officer interrogated.</t1918>
<t1919>− Your Excellency, one person.</t1919>
<t1920>− Damn these fools to hell! What is that person's name?</t1920> <t1921>You know everyone in this area.</t1921> <t1922>Who is that person? −</t1922> <t1923>Please, Your Excellency! That person is not from around here.</t1923> <t1924>In my entire life, I have never met him.</t1924>
<t1925>− Swinging on a chain?</t1925> <t1926>Do you want to suffocate? −</t1926> <t1927>With all due respect, sir, I was wondering the same thing.</t1927> <t1928>His head was thrown back... like this!</t1928> <t1929>He turned sideways, leaned against the carriage, threw his head back, face towards the sky; then he returned to his normal posture, wrung his hat in his hands, and bowed respectfully.</t1929>
<t1930>− What does that person look like? −</t1930> <t1931>Your Excellency, he looks even whiter than a flour miller.</t1931> <t1932>Dust covers him all over, pale as a ghost, tall as a ghost!</t1932> <t1933>That description caused the whole crowd to stir; but all eyes, without being told, turned towards the Marquis.</t1933> <t1934>Perhaps to see if there was any ghost in his conscience.</t1934>
<t1935>− Alright, I commend you, - said the Marquis, inwardly pleased knowing that a lowly creature like this wouldn't dare to anger him.</t1935> <t1936>- You saw a thief following my carriage and didn't even open your mouth.</t1936> <t1937>Hmph! Throw him out, Mr. Gabelle! Mr. Gabelle was the station master and also collected some other taxes; he had been obsequiously assisting with the interrogation and had importantly grabbed the sleeve of the questioned person.</t1937>
<t1938>− Hmph! Get out of the way! - Mr. Gabelle said.</t1938>
<t1939>− If that stranger tries to stay in this village tonight, arrest him, and make sure he has no malicious intent, Gabelle.</t1939>
<t1940>− Sir, it is truly an honor to follow your orders.</t1940>
<t1941>− Where did he run off to, that boy?...</t1941> <t1942>Where is that wretched boy?</t1942> <t1943>That wretched boy had crawled under the car along with five or six acquaintances and was pointing at the chain with his green hat.</t1943> <t1944>Five or six other acquaintances quickly pulled him out and dragged the panting boy to stand before the Marquis.</t1944>
<t1945>− You fool, did that person run away when our car stopped to engage the brake? −</t1945> <t1946>Your Excellency, at that moment he jumped headfirst down the hillside, just like someone diving into a river.</t1946>
<t1947>− Take care of this matter, Gabelle.</t1947> <t1948>Let's go!</t1948> <t1949>The people were staring at the chain still dragging between the wheels like a flock of sheep; the carriage moved so suddenly that it was fortunate their skin-and-bone bodies weren't crushed; they had nothing but skin and bones, otherwise, they might not have escaped unscathed.</t1949>
<t1950>The rapid speed of the carriage as it dashed out of the village and raced up the distant hill was soon hindered by the steep slope.</t1950> <t1951>Gradually, the carriage slowed down to a walking pace, swaying and laboriously climbing the hill in the fragrant summer night.</t1951> <t1952>Instead of the avenging goddesses, thousands of gnats swarmed around the two coachmen like a sheer curtain, and the tips of their whips now silently struck at this curtain of gnats rather than the horses; the servant walked beside the horses; the postman who went ahead had disappeared from sight, only the sound of his footsteps could be heard in the dim distance.</t1952>
<t1953>At the very peak of the hill was a small graveyard, with a cross on which there was a large statue of Christ the Savior; it was a crude wooden statue carved by some amateur villager, but he had studied the model from real life - possibly his own life - because the statue was terribly thin and frail.</t1953>
<t1954>In front of the symbol of the great and worsening suffering - and it is not yet the worst - a woman is kneeling.</t1954> <t1955>Turning her head upon hearing the sound of a carriage approaching, she hastily stands up and goes to the door.</t1955>
<t1956>− It is truly you, Your Honor! Please, may the heavens shed light on this matter.</t1956>
<t1957>Letting out a sound of impatience but with an unchanged expression, the official looked out.</t1957>
<t1958>− Again! What is it? Always begging! −</t1958> <t1959>Your Excellency, please have mercy for the Lord's sake!</t1959> <t1960>My husband, the woodcutter.</t1960>
<t1961>− What happened to your woodcutter husband?</t1961> <t1962>You commoners are always like this.</t1962> <t1963>Did your husband owe a debt he couldn't repay? −</t1963> <t1964>My husband has paid off all his debts, Your Excellency.</t1964> <t1965>My husband has died.</t1965>
<t1966>− Good! It is at peace now.</t1966> <t1967>Do you want me to bring it back to life? −</t1967> <t1968>Oh, no, Your Excellency! But my husband lies here, beneath this mound of withered grass.</t1968>
<t1969>− Then what? −</t1969> <t1970>Your Honor, there are too many mounds of earth covered with withered grass around here...</t1970>
<t1971>− But why? She looks like an old lady, but she's still young.</t1971> <t1972>In extreme anguish, she kept twisting her bony, vein-covered hands together violently, then placed one hand on the car door - gently, tenderly, as if that inanimate object were the chest of a person who could be moved by a pleading gesture.</t1972>
<t1973>− Your Excellency, please listen to me! Your Excellency, please let the heavens shed light on this!</t1973> <t1974>My husband died of hunger; and many more will die of hunger.</t1974>
<t1975>− And then what?</t1975> <t1976>Should we feed them? −</t1976> <t1977>Your Excellency, with the sacred witness of the Lord, I am not asking you for that.</t1977> <t1978>I only ask for a piece of stone or wood with my husband's name to mark his burial place.</t1978> <t1979>If not, this place will soon be forgotten, and no one will find the grave anymore once I also die of hunger and lie under some grass-covered mound.</t1979> <t1980>Your Excellency; there are too many dead, increasing rapidly, and there is hunger everywhere.</t1980> <t1981>Your Excellency! Please!</t1981> <t1982>The servant pushed her away from the carriage door, the horses galloped away, the two coachmen spurred the horses to run faster, leaving the woman behind, while the Excellency - once again escorted by the avenging goddesses - was quickly shortening the miles to his private castle.</t1982>
<t1983>The fragrant summer night enveloped him, and as carefree as the falling rain, the night also enveloped the filthy, ragged, and weary laborers at the fountain not far away; the road worker, with the accompaniment of his green hat representing his self-worth, continued to gossip about the ghostly figure clinging to the vehicle, as long as there was someone to listen.</t1983> <t1984>Gradually growing bored, one by one they left, the lights flickering in the small windows; then the lights in the windows also gradually went out, more stars appeared, as if they were lanterns that had not been extinguished but had soared up into the sparkling sky.</t1984>
<t1985>The shadow of a large mansion with high roofs and many extending branches at that moment was enveloping the Marquis; and the darkness was replaced by the light of a torch when the carriage came to a stop, then the large gate of the castle opened to welcome him.</t1985>
<t1986>− I am waiting for Sir Charles, has the young master from England arrived yet? −</t1986> <t1987>Sir, not yet.</t1987>
<t1988>9.</t1988> <t1989>The head of the Gorgon*</t1989>
<t1990>The Marquis's castle is a magnificent and splendid building, with a stone-paved courtyard in front and two curved stone staircases leading up to the two ends of the stone-paved veranda in front of the main door.</t1990> <t1991>An entire stone estate, with stone balconies, stone vases, stone flowers, stone faces, and stone lion heads everywhere.</t1991> <t1992>It was as if everything had turned to stone under the gaze of the Gorgon when the castle was completed two centuries ago.</t1992>
<t1993>The torch leading the way, the Marquis stepped out of the carriage and ascended the low steps; his footsteps stirred the darkness, causing an owl perched on the roof of the grand stables, barely visible behind the trees, to hoot loudly in protest.</t1993> <t1994>All around was so quiet that the torch being carried up the stairs and another torch placed at the main door burned as softly as if they were in a banquet hall rather than under the night sky.</t1994>
<t1995>Besides the sound of the owl hooting, no other sound could be heard, except for the water from the fountain flowing into the stone basin; it seemed as if the dark night, having been holding its breath for hours, suddenly let out a long, lingering sigh and then held its breath again.</t1995>
<t1996>The main door slammed shut behind him, the Marquis strode across the eerie, gloomy hall, where old hunting weapons like boar spears, swords, and hunting knives were displayed; and even more frightening with all kinds of horsewhips that many peasants had tasted before being granted mercy by death due to the lord's wrath.</t1996>
<t1997>Avoiding the large, dark rooms that were locked tight tonight, the Marquis followed the torchbearer up the stairs to a hallway door.</t1997> <t1998>The door opened to welcome him into a private suite with three rooms: a bedroom and two other rooms.</t1998> <t1999>The rooms had high vaulted ceilings with cold stone floors without carpets, large grates in the fireplaces for burning wood in the winter, and every luxury befitting the Marquis's status in this opulent era and country.</t1999> <t2000>The furniture was luxurious in the style of several generations of Louis - before King Louis XIV but from a lineage that seemed destined to rule forever*; further diversified by other pieces bearing the marks of various periods in French history.</t2000>
<t2001>A dining table was set for two people in the third room; the round room was located in one of the four pointed towers resembling a candle snuffer.</t2001> <t2002>The small room had a high ceiling, the windows were wide open but covered with wooden blinds, so only the black night could be seen as small horizontal lines alternating with large gray stripes.</t2002>
<t2003>− Setting the table for my nephew, are we? - The Marquis said, glancing at the dining table, hearing the servant say it was not yet ready.</t2003>
<t2004>The young master has not arrived yet, but the high-ranking official is waiting for him.</t2004>
<t2005>− Ah! He might not come tonight; nevertheless, leave the table set.</t2005> <t2006>We will have dinner in fifteen minutes.</t2006>
<t2007>Fifteen minutes later, the high-ranking official was ready, sitting alone to enjoy a lavish and sumptuous meal.</t2007> <t2008>His chair faced the window, and after finishing the soup, he raised a glass of Bordeaux to his lips but immediately put it down.</t2008>
<t2009>− What is that? - The marquis asked calmly, his eyes intently watching the alternating black and gray stripes on the curtain.</t2009>
<t2010>− Your Excellency? What is it? −</t2010> <t2011>Outside the curtain.</t2011> <t2012>Pull the curtain aside.</t2012>
<t2013>The curtain has been drawn.</t2013>
<t2014>− What? −</t2014> <t2015>Sir, there's nothing at all.</t2015> <t2016>There are only trees, leaves, and darkness here.</t2016>
<t2017>The servant spoke after having fully opened the curtain, looked out at the empty black sky, and turned back to look at the Marquis awaiting orders.</t2017>
<t2018>− Good, - the master calmly said.</t2018> <t2019>- Close it.</t2019>
<t2020>The curtain had closed, and the Marquis continued his meal.</t2020> <t2021>The Marquis, halfway through his meal, paused with a glass of wine in hand.</t2021> <t2022>There was the sound of a carriage rolling.</t2022> <t2023>The sound of the carriage quickly approached and then stopped right in front of the castle.</t2023>
<t2024>− Ask who is coming.</t2024>
<t2025>He is the nephew of the high-ranking official.</t2025> <t2026>In the early afternoon, he was trailing the high-ranking official by a few miles.</t2026> <t2027>The nephew tried to shorten the distance quickly but couldn't catch up with his uncle on the road.</t2027> <t2028>At the relay station, he heard that the high-ranking official had already gone ahead.</t2028>
<t2029>The servant said that dinner was ready upstairs and the master wanted him to join the meal.</t2029> <t2030>A moment later, he arrived. In England, everyone called him Charles Darnay.</t2030>
<t2031>The high-ranking official greeted the child politely, but the two did not shake hands.</t2031>
<t2032>− Uncle, did you leave Paris yesterday? - He asked the Marquis as he sat down at the table.</t2032>
<t2033>− Yesterday.</t2033> <t2034>And you? − I came straight here.</t2034>
<t2035>− From London? − Yes.</t2035>
<t2036>− You are wasting too much time, - the Marquis said with a smile.</t2036>
<t2037>− On the contrary, I went straight ahead without stopping.</t2037>
<t2038>− Sorry! I didn't mean the travel time, but the time to decide to set off.</t2038>
<t2039>- I am hindered because...</t2039> <t2040>- the nephew replied hesitantly, - ... many things.</t2040>
<t2041>− Certainly, - the polite uncle said.</t2041>
<t2042>With the servant present, they did not say another word.</t2042> <t2043>When the coffee had been served and only the two of them remained, the nephew looked at his uncle, straight into the eyes of that delicate mask-like face, and began the conversation.</t2043>
<t2044>− I have returned, sir, as you know, to continue the purpose that made me leave.</t2044> <t2045>That purpose has pushed me into immeasurable danger; but it is a sacred purpose and if I must die for it, I still wish to pursue it to the end.</t2045>
<t2046>− Don't say "die," - said the uncle, - there's no need to say "die."</t2046>
<t2047>− I doubt that, - the nephew replied, - if it were to push me to death, I wonder if you would stop me.</t2047>
<t2048>The deep lines on the tip of the nose and the fine wrinkles running across that ruthless face looked more ominous than benign; the uncle made a polite gesture of protest, but it was clearly just a sign of courtesy rather than reassurance.</t2048>
<t2049>− Sir, - the nephew continued, - in fact, as far as I know, you may have deliberately arranged things to make my already suspicious circumstances even more suspicious.</t2049>
<t2050>− No, no, no, - the uncle said, in a cheerful voice.</t2050>
<t2051>− But whether there is or not, - the nephew looked at the Marquis with outright suspicion, - I know your strategy is to stop me by any means, and you will not shy away from any measure.</t2051>
<t2052>− My dear child, I already told you, - the uncle said, the two creases on the tip of his nose gently flaring.</t2052> <t2053>- Please remember what I told you, a long time ago.</t2053>
<t2054>− I haven't forgotten.</t2054>
<t2055>− Thank you, - the Marquis said, in an exceedingly sweet voice.</t2055>
<t2056>The resonance of that voice kept humming like a musical instrument.</t2056> <t2057>The nephew continued: − Honestly, I believe that it was both due to your bad luck and my good fortune that I wasn't thrown into prison in this land of France.</t2057>
<t2058>− I don't quite understand what you mean, - the uncle replied while sipping his coffee.</t2058> <t2059>Could you explain it more clearly? −</t2059> <t2060>I think that if you hadn't fallen out of favor with the court, and if it weren't for that ominous cloud over the past few years, you would have already thrown me into prison indefinitely with just one order.</t2060>
<t2061>− It's possible, - the uncle said very calmly.</t2061> <t2062>- For the honor of the family, I might even decide to take action to that extent.</t2062> <t2063>Sorry! − I understand that, luckily for me, at the reception the day before yesterday, you were still treated coldly as usual, - the nephew noted.</t2063>
<t2064>− I don't think it's luck, my dear, - the uncle replied, his voice still polite and courteous.</t2064> <t2065>- I'm not so sure about that.</t2065> <t2066>Prison is also a good opportunity to reflect in suitable solitude, and it might influence your fate even better than you steering your own destiny.</t2066> <t2067>But what good is it to discuss that.</t2067> <t2068>As you said, I am at a disadvantage.</t2068> <t2069>Such small corrective measures, such gentle tools to support the authority and prestige of the family, such minor favors might be very inconvenient for you, requiring interest and pleading to obtain.</t2069> <t2070>Many seek them but very few are granted! It used to be different, but France has changed for the worse.</t2070> <t2071>Our ancestors not long ago held the power of life and death over the coarse commoners around.</t2071> <t2072>From this room, many such beasts were dragged out to be hanged; in the next room, now my bedroom, one was stabbed to death on the spot for daring to speak impertinently about his daughter! What was his daughter worth? We have lost many privileges; new philosophies have become fashionable; in these times, asserting the family's status might, I don't say certainly but might, cause us real trouble.</t2072> <t2073>Everything is very bad, very bad! The marquis took a light pinch of snuff and shook his head elegantly, appearing deeply disappointed with the country that housed him, the great man capable of restoring the family's status.</t2073>
<t2074>− We have affirmed our position, both past and present, - the grandson said in a sorrowful tone, - to the extent that I believe our family's honor in this nation of France is more hated than any other lineage.</t2074>
<t2075>− Let's hope so, - the uncle said.</t2075> <t2076>- Resentment towards superiors is the involuntary respect of the lowly.</t2076>
<t2077>− Throughout this land, - the nephew continued, in the same tone, - I see no face looking at me with any hint of respect, only the dark obedience of fear and servitude.</t2077>
<t2078>− That is indeed the praise of the authority of this family, - the Marquis said, - truly worthy of the way our family maintains its authority. Ha! And he took a light sniff of another pinch of tobacco and comfortably crossed his legs.</t2078>
<t2079>But when the nephew rested his elbows on the table, covering his contemplative and weary eyes with his hands, that delicate mask glanced at him with a sharp, scrutinizing, and hateful look, completely unlike the nonchalant expression it had previously worn.</t2079>
<t2080>− Suppression is the only sustainable philosophy, - the Marquis said.</t2080> <t2081>- That dark obedience of fear and slavery, young man, will make the beasts obey the whip, as long as this roof, - he looked up, - still covers the sky.</t2081>
<t2082>That might not last as long as the Marquis thinks.</t2082> <t2083>If tonight I could show you the image of this castle just a few years later, and the image of fifty other mansions like it a few years later, you might not recognize which one is the residence among those terrifying, looted, and charred ruins.</t2083> <t2084>As for the roof that you praise, you would surely see it covering the sky in a different way - that is, with eyes forever darkened when bodies have absorbed countless volleys of bullets fired from hundreds of thousands of guns.</t2084>
<t2085>− As for now, - the Marquis continued, - I am the protector of the honor and peace of this family, something you do not wish to do.</t2085> <t2086>But you must be tired.</t2086> <t2087>Shall we end the conversation tonight? −</t2087> <t2088>A little later.</t2088>
<t2089>− One more hour, if you want.</t2089>
<t2090>− Sir, - the nephew said, - we have sown the wind and now we are about to reap the whirlwind.</t2090>
<t2091>− Are we sowing the wind? - The marquis repeated with an inquisitive smile, gently pointing his finger at his nephew and then at himself.</t2091>
<t2092>− Our family, our noble family, that nobility means a great deal to both you and me, but in two very different ways.</t2092> <t2093>Even in my father's time, we indeed committed many wrongs, harming anyone who obstructed our pleasures, whatever those pleasures might be.</t2093> <t2094>Why should I speak of my father's time, when it was also your time?</t2094> <t2095>Can I separate the twin brother, the co-heir, and the successor that you are from my own father? −</t2095> <t2096>Death has already done that! - The Marquis said.</t2096>
<t2097>− And it has bound me to an institution that I abhor, for which I am responsible but utterly powerless, - the nephew replied.</t2097> <t2098>- I must find a way to fulfill the last wish that my beloved mother expressed, to follow the final look of my beloved mother pleading for my forgiveness and to make amends for the past; and I have suffered in vain seeking help.</t2098>
<t2099>− If you ask me for help, - the Marquis said while lightly poking his nephew's chest with his index finger, as the two stood by the fireplace, - then you can rest assured that it will be forever hopeless.</t2099>
<t2100>All the delicate lines on that pale face wrinkled brutally and cunningly as the Marquis, holding a snuffbox, stood silently watching his nephew.</t2100> <t2101>Once again, the Marquis pointed at the chest of the person opposite as if his index finger were the tip of a sharp dagger that he would skillfully and deftly thrust through that body.</t2101>
<t2102>He said: − Dear child, I will protect the institution that I have lived for until death.</t2102>
<t2103>After finishing his words, he took one last satisfying puff of his cigarette and then put the cigarette case back into his pocket.</t2103>
<t2104>− It is best to live according to reason, - he added after ringing the small bell on the table to call the servant, - and to accept one's predestined fate.</t2104> <t2105>But I see you have lost it, young master Charles.</t2105>
<t2106>− This inheritance and my France, I have lost both, - the nephew said sadly.</t2106> <t2107>- I have given up on both.</t2107>
<t2108>− Neither of them belongs to you, so why give them up?</t2108> <t2109>France, perhaps, but the inheritance? That's not even worth mentioning; but does it belong to you yet? −</t2109> <t2110>I said that without any intention of claiming that right.</t2110>
<t2111>If I inherit from my uncle tomorrow...</t2111>
<t2112>− I dare say that is a vain hope.</t2112>
<t2113>− ... twenty or twenty years later...</t2113>
<t2114>− You honor me too much, - said the Marquis, - but I prefer that hypothesis.</t2114>
<t2115>− ... then I would also give up, and live in a different way, in a different place.</t2115> <t2116>What is there to regret about this place filled only with suffering and decay.</t2116>
<t2117>− Ah! - The Marquis said while looking around the luxurious room.</t2117>
<t2118>− Here it looks beautiful, but in reality, if you look under clear skies and bright sunlight, the whole place is just a pile of useless ruins, chaos, robbery, debt, pawn, oppression, poverty, nakedness, and suffering.</t2118>
<t2119>− Ah! - The marquis exclaimed with great satisfaction.</t2119>
<t2120>− If this place were mine, I would entrust it to someone more capable to gradually, if possible, free it from the heavy burden it has long borne, so that the wretched people who cannot leave this land and have been exhausted for generations might suffer less in the future; but this place is not for me.</t2120> <t2121>This estate has been cursed, and so has this land.</t2121>
<t2122>− And you? - The uncle said.</t2122> <t2123>- May I be a bit curious; with that new philosophy, how do you plan to make a living? −</t2123> <t2124>To live, I have to work, like my fellow countrymen, even those of noble birth will have to work one day.</t2124>
<t2125>− In England, for example? −</t2125> <t2126>Yes, sir.</t2126> <t2127>In that country, I will be able to preserve the family honor.</t2127> <t2128>Leaving the country means I will not tarnish the family honor because I will no longer hold any title.</t2128>
<t2129>The sound of the bell had signaled the servants to light the lamps in the adjacent bedroom.</t2129> <t2130>Through the connecting door, that room was already brightly lit.</t2130> <t2131>The Marquis looked towards the bedroom and listened to the retreating footsteps of the servant.</t2131>
<t2132>− England is indeed very appealing to you, even though you haven't been very successful there, - he remarked, and that calm face turned to smile at his nephew.</t2132>
<t2133>− As I said, to succeed there, I know I will owe you, sir.</t2133> <t2134>Besides that, it is my refuge.</t2134>
<t2135>− Those boastful Englishmen still say that England is a refuge for many people.</t2135> <t2136>Do you know a fellow countryman who also sought refuge over there?</t2136> <t2137>A doctor? −</t2137> <t2138>I know.</t2138>
<t2139>− With your daughter? − Yes − Ah, - the Marquis said. - You must be tired.</t2139> <t2140>Goodbye! As he bowed very politely, his smiling face had a hidden look that made his words full of mystery; both the image and the sound struck the nephew's eyes and ears.</t2140> <t2141>At the same time, the thin lines around his eyelids and his flat thin lips, along with the wrinkles at the tip of his nose, all curved with a sarcastic look, making the Marquis appear both handsome and strangely evil.</t2141>
<t2142>− Yes, - the Marquis repeated. - A doctor along with his daughter. Yes.</t2142>
<t2143>Thus begins a new philosophy.</t2143> <t2144>You are already tired.</t2144> <t2145>Goodbye!</t2145> <t2146>Asking that face is no different from asking the stone statues outside the castle.</t2146> <t2147>The nephew looked at the Marquis in astonishment while walking out the door.</t2147>
<t2148>− Goodbye! - The uncle said.</t2148> <t2149>- I hope to see you again tomorrow morning.</t2149>
<t2150>Good night! Light the torch to guide the young master back to his room!...</t2150> <t2151>Then burn the young master on his bed as well, - he muttered to himself before ringing the small bell once more, calling the servants to prepare his private room.</t2151>
<t2152>The servants came and went, the Marquis in his loose nightgown walked back and forth to relax and fall asleep in the still, sultry night.</t2152> <t2153>Only the sound of rustling fabric and the soft footsteps on the floor could be heard, making no noise, he walked around the room like a majestic tiger - just like some wicked, unruly Marquis in legend punished by magic to transform into a tiger, and now was the moment he was changing back into a man or about to turn into a beast.</t2153>
<t2154>He walked from one end to the other in the magnificent bedroom, while reluctantly recounting in his mind the events of the previous day's journey; the arduous and slow climb up the hill at sunset, the setting sun, the descent, the windmill, the prison on the cliff, the small village in the valley, the crowd of peasants by the water fountain, and the road worker with the green hat pointing at the chain under the carriage.</t2154> <t2155>That water fountain reminded him of the one in Paris, the small cloth bundle lying on the pedestal, the women bending over the bundle, and the tall man raising his hands to the sky shouting "Death!".</t2155>
<t2156>− It's cool now, - the Marquis said, - it's probably time to sleep.</t2156>
<t2157>So, leaving only a single torch burning brightly on the large fireplace, he let down the thin gauze curtains around the bed, and listened as the night shattered the silence with a sigh as he drifted into sleep.</t2157>
<t2158>The stone faces on the outer walls stared blindly into the dark night for three dragging hours; during those dragging three hours, the horses in the stable clattered their mangers, the dogs barked, and the owl hooted a sound that didn't quite match the one poets often attribute to it.</t2158>
<t2159>But some stubborn species like owls never agree to speak according to the descriptions imposed on them.</t2159>
<t2160>For three tedious hours, the stone faces of the castle, both lion and human, stared blindly into the night.</t2160> <t2161>The deadly darkness enveloped the scene, the deadly darkness weighed heavily on the silent dust of the road, adding to the stillness all around.</t2161> <t2162>The black night blurred all the withered grass mounds in the graveyard, making them indistinguishable; even if the statue of Christ on the cross descended, no one would know.</t2162> <t2163>In the village; both the tax collector and the taxpayer were sound asleep.</t2163> <t2164>Perhaps the emaciated common folk were dreaming of feasts, as the hungry often dream of food, as the exhausted slave dreams of leisure, as the burdened ox dreams of rest, and in their dreams, all are well-fed and free.</t2164>
<t2165>The village fountain flows unheard and unseen, the castle fountain drips unnoticed and unheard - both vanish into the night like each second and minute counting the rhythm of time throughout three dark hours.</t2165> <t2166>And then, the eerie streams of the two fountains begin to glow mysteriously at dawn, and the stone statue eyes on the castle facade open wide.</t2166>
<t2167>The sky gradually brightened, brightened, until the sun finally rose to the treetops, quietly spreading its rays across the hills.</t2167> <t2168>In the morning glow, the water in the castle's fountain turned to the color of blood, and the stone statues glowed red.</t2168> <t2169>The birds' music soared high, and on the large, weather-beaten window ledge of the Marquis' bedroom, a small bird poured all its melody into its song.</t2169> <t2170>The song seemed to make the nearby stone statue widen its eyes, open its mouth, and gape in astonishment and fear.</t2170>
<t2171>At this moment, the sun had risen high, and the village below began its activities.</t2171> <t2172>The wide windows opened, the cracked doors unlatched, and the villagers stepped out onto the streets, shivering in the gentle chill of the new day.</t2172> <t2173>Then the villagers' daily tasks, rarely light, began.</t2173> <t2174>Some went to the water station; some went to the fields; here, men and women dug; there, women and men tended to the miserable livestock and led the emaciated cows to find the remaining patches of grass along the roadside.</t2174> <t2175>In the church beneath the cross, one or two people knelt, joining in the newly intoned prayers, while the cow they had brought along tried to fill its stomach with the wild grass at its feet.</t2175>
<t2176>The castle woke up later but gradually, bit by bit, according to its noble nature.</t2176> <t2177>First, the boar spears and the hunting knives would gleam with steel in the early sunlight, glowing red as they once did when bathed in blood; then the main doors and windows would fling open; the horses in the stables would turn their heads to the light and welcome the fresh breeze rushing in through the threshold; the shimmering leaves would rustle before the iron-grilled windows; the dogs would tug at their chains, eager to be set free.</t2177>
<t2178>All those trivial matters were part of the morning routine.</t2178> <t2179>Of course, except for the loud ringing of the bell in the castle, except for the sound of footsteps running up and down the stairs, except for the hurried figures on the veranda, except for the chaotic clatter of shoes everywhere, except for the hasty saddling and the thunderous gallop of horses.</t2179>
<t2180>What wind brought that urgency to the old road worker with silver hair, who had started working on the hilltop behind the village, beside a pile of rocks with a meager food package so scant that not even a crow would bother to peck at it?</t2180> <t2181>Could it be that the birds had carried that urgency away like they carried grains of rice to distant places and had accidentally scattered it upon the old road worker's head? Whether or not that was the case, on that sweltering morning, he had run full speed down the hill, dust rising up to his knees, and ran straight to the fountain.</t2181>
<t2182>The entire village had gathered, standing around the fountain in a state of boredom and whispering in low voices, but showing no other emotion than cruel curiosity and surprise.</t2182> <t2183>The dumb cows that had been led away earlier were now hastily dragged back and tied to anything that could hold them, standing or lying down chewing on things not worth the effort that they had grazed on during their interrupted wander.</t2183> <t2184>The people from the castle and the people from the service station, along with various tax officials, all more or less armed, had gathered into a group on the other side of the small road, bustling about without knowing what to do.</t2184> <t2185>The road worker had pushed his way into the middle of a group of about fifty acquaintances and was beating his chest with his green hat.</t2185> <t2186>What was the matter, what was so urgent that Mr. Gabelle had to hurriedly mount a horse, sitting behind the castle's servant, and both galloped away like lovers in the ballad of Leonora? The misfortune was that another stone face had appeared at the castle.</t2186>
<t2187>The Gorgon god in the night glanced over this mansion once more and added a missing stone face; the stone face that the god had been waiting for two hundred years.</t2187>
<t2188>That stone face lay on the pillow of the Marquis.</t2188> <t2189>It resembled a beautiful mask, suddenly terrified, angry, then turned to stone.</t2189> <t2190>Stabbing through the heart of the stone figure attached to that face was a knife.</t2190> <t2191>Around the knife's hilt was tied a crumpled piece of paper with scrawled writing: "Get to the grave quickly. - JACQUES"</t2191>
<t2192>10.</t2192> <t2193>Two Promises</t2193>
<t2194>Months passed and years came, after twelve months Charles Darnay had settled in England in the role of a senior French teacher well-versed in French literature. Nowadays, he would be called a professor; back then, he was referred to as a university tutor*.</t2194> <t2195>He taught young men who were interested and concerned with learning a globally popular foreign language, nurturing in them an appreciation for the treasure trove of knowledge and the beauty of the French language.</t2195> <t2196>Additionally, he could write fluently in English on these subjects and translate works into English very well.</t2196> <t2197>Such teachers were not easy to find at that time; the royalty awaiting succession had not yet been exiled to teach for a living, nor had any nobleman exhausted their accounts at Tellson's Bank to the point of becoming a cook or carpenter.</t2197> <t2198>As a tutor with the goal of making students find learning both interesting and useful, and as a talented translator who could bring many new meanings to translations beyond the limits of the dictionary, Darnay quickly became famous and was encouraged.</t2198> <t2199>Moreover, he had a clear understanding of the current affairs in France, which were increasingly of interest to many people.</t2199> <t2200>Therefore, through perseverance and determination, he succeeded.</t2200>
<t2201>In London, he did not expect to walk on streets paved with gold or lie on rose-petal-strewn mattresses; if he had such lofty expectations, he would have already failed.</t2201> <t2202>He only wanted to work and found a job, made efforts, and never lost heart.</t2202> <t2203>His success stemmed from that.</t2203>
<t2204>Part of his time was spent teaching at Cambridge to students, a school that accepted him as a smuggler of tax-evading European languages rather than a merchant of Greek and Latin antiquities who goes straight through customs.</t2204> <t2205>The rest of his time was spent in London.</t2205>
<t2206>And so, from the days when it was always summer in the Garden of Eden until it turned into the winter of the fallen world, the world of that gentleman followed a single focused path, the path of Charles Darnay - the path to the heart of a woman.</t2206>
<t2207>He had loved Lucie Manette from the moment his life was in danger.</t2207>
<t2208>Never before had he heard a sound as gentle and lovely as her sympathetic voice; never before had he seen a face as beautiful and kind-hearted as hers when Lucie looked at him standing by the edge of the freshly dug grave. Yet he had never once expressed his feelings; the assassination a year ago at the desolate castle across the stormy sea and the long, dusty miles - the towering stone castle now just a hazy dream - and he still had not, even once, confessed his heart to Lucie.</t2208>
<t2209>He had a reason to remain silent; he knew all too well.</t2209> <t2210>Then one summer day, when he returned to London after his university teaching duties, Darnay turned into a quiet corner of Soho, determined to find an opportunity to express his feelings to Dr. Manette.</t2210> <t2211>It was a late summer day, and he knew Lucie would be out with Miss Pross.</t2211>
<t2212>I saw the doctor reading a book in the armchair by the window.</t2212> <t2213>The source of vitality, once thought to be exhausted due to the struggles of past hardships, has gradually recovered.</t2213> <t2214>He is now truly a person full of life, with a steadfast purpose, strong determination, and enthusiastic activity.</t2214> <t2215>That source of vitality sometimes also suddenly depletes as seen during the early stages of his recovery; however, such episodes do not occur frequently and are becoming increasingly rare.</t2215>
<t2216>He read a lot, slept little, was hardworking, and always cheerful.</t2216> <t2217>Seeing Charles Darnay enter, he set the book aside and extended his hand for a shake.</t2217>
<t2218>− Charles Darnay! It's so good to see you.</t2218> <t2219>We had calculated that you must have returned here three or four days ago.</t2219> <t2220>Yesterday, both lawyer Stryver and Sydney Carton came here, and both said that this time you were gone longer than usual.</t2220>
<t2221>− Thank them for their concern about me, - he replied, somewhat coldly at the mention of the two others, though still courteous with the doctor. - Miss Manette...</t2221>
<t2222>− Still healthy, - the doctor interrupted, - and we are all happy that you have returned.</t2222> <t2223>Lucie has gone out to take care of some household chores, but she will be back soon.</t2223>
<t2224>− Dr. Manette, I know she is not home, so I take this opportunity to speak with you.</t2224>
<t2225>Empty silence.</t2225>
<t2226>− Really? - The doctor clearly tried to stay calm.</t2226> <t2227>- Bring a chair over here and we'll talk.</t2227>
<t2228>He brought the chair over but found it hard to speak.</t2228>
<t2229>− Doctor, - he said after a while, - I have had the honor of being warmly welcomed here for a year and a half now, so I hope that what I am about to say will not...</t2229>
<t2230>The doctor raised his hand to stop him and kept it in front of him for a moment before withdrawing and saying: −</t2230> <t2231>Is it about Lucie? − Yes, it is.</t2231>
<t2232>− I always find it difficult to talk about Lucie.</t2232> <t2233>And it is also very hard for me to hear you speak about Lucie in that tone, Mr. Charles Darnay.</t2233>
<t2234>− That is a voice of earnest admiration, sincere respect, and deep affection, Dr. Manette! - Darnay's words were full of reverence.</t2234>
<t2235>After another moment of empty silence, the father finally replied: −</t2235> <t2236>I trust you. You are trustworthy, I know.</t2236>
<t2237>The doctor's restraint was evident because he did not want to talk about his daughter, and this attitude was so pronounced that it made Charles Darnay hesitant.</t2237>
<t2238>− Can I continue, sir?</t2238> <t2239>Another moment of emptiness.</t2239>
<t2240>− Alright, continue.</t2240>
<t2241>− You must have known beforehand what I was going to say, even though you couldn't know how seriously I would say it, how sincerely I would feel, if you didn't understand my innermost feelings, understand the many hopes, fears, and heavy worries I've carried for so long.</t2241> <t2242>Dear Dr. Manette, I love your daughter passionately, deeply, wholeheartedly, selflessly.</t2242> <t2243>If there is love in this world, it is the love I have for her.</t2243> <t2244>You have loved before; let your past love speak for me! The doctor sat listening, his face turned away, his eyes directed to the ground.</t2244> <t2245>Hearing the last sentence, he hastily reached out his hand and exclaimed: −</t2245> <t2246>Don't say that, sir! Let it go! Please don't mention the past! Like a cry of real pain, his words ended but the echo still resonated in Charles Darnay's ears.</t2246> <t2247>The hand extended trembled as if begging Darnay to stop speaking.</t2247> <t2248>The young man understood and remained silent.</t2248>
<t2249>− I'm sorry, - after a moment the doctor spoke softly. - I have never doubted your love for Lucie; you can trust me.</t2249>
<t2250>Still sitting in the chair, he turned towards Darnay but did not look at him or raise his head, his hand still supporting his chin, his silver hair covering his face.</t2250>
<t2251>− Have you talked to Lucie yet? −</t2251> <t2252>Not yet.</t2252>
<t2253>− Not even write a letter? −</t2253> <t2254>Not at all.</t2254>
<t2255>− I would be narrow-minded if I pretended not to know that you have tried to avoid expressing your feelings to my daughter out of respect for her father.</t2255> <t2256>I thank you.</t2256>
<t2257>He extended his hand but his eyes did not follow.</t2257>
<t2258>− I know, - Darnay said respectfully, - how could I not know, Dr. Manette, I have seen the two of you together every day, seen how much you and Miss Manette love each other, how deeply moved you are, how close you are, and I understand the circumstances you both have been through. Truly, the bond between father and daughter is rarely matched.</t2258><t2259>I know, Doctor... how could I not know,... that beyond the love and duty of an adult daughter, Lucie holds for you all the love and reliance of a child.</t2259><t2260>I know that since childhood, Lucie has lived without her parents, so now she gives all her steadfast affection of the present years to her father, along with the trust and attachment she lacked as a child.</t2260><t2261>I know very well that even if you had returned to this world from the other side, in her eyes, you could not be more sacred than you have been all this time.</t2261><t2262>I know that when she holds her father tightly, the arms around his neck are those of a child, a young girl, and a grown woman all at once.</t2262><t2263>I know that through her love for her father, she sees and loves her young mother, sees and loves her young father, loves her suffering mother, and loves her father who faced terrifying ordeals and was fortunate to survive.</t2263><t2264>I have known this, through many days and nights, since I visited you in this house.</t2264>
<t2265>The father sat in silence, his head bowed.</t2265> <t2266>His breathing was a bit more rapid, but he showed no signs of anger.</t2266>
<t2267>− Dear Dr. Manette, because I have always known that, because I have always seen the two of you together in the radiance of that fatherly love, I have tried to restrain myself, and restrained myself to the utmost limits of human endurance.</t2267> <t2268>I have felt, and even now feel, that if I were to let my love... even my love... come between the two of you, it would be like tarnishing that fatherly love with a lesser emotion.</t2268> <t2269>But I love her.</t2269> <t2270>Heaven bear witness that I love her! −</t2270> <t2271>I believe that, - the father replied sorrowfully, his voice filled with a sadness that sounded like a reproach.</t2271> <t2272>- I have thought so before. I believe that.</t2272>
<t2273>− But sir, - Darnay said, - please do not think that if I am fortunate enough to have her as my wife, I would separate the father and daughter; if that were the case, I would not be able to or dare to utter a word of what I am saying now.</t2273> <t2274>Moreover, I know very well that it is impossible to separate father and daughter, I know very well that doing so would be despicable.</t2274> <t2275>If I had that intention, no matter how distant in the future, if it were harbored in my mind, secretly in my heart... if I had that intention...</t2275> <t2276>if I had thought that way... then how could I dare to touch this revered hand at this moment.</t2276>
<t2277>He placed his hand on his father's hand as emotions overflowed.</t2277>
<t2278>− No, Dr. Manette.</t2278> <t2279>Like you, a person who voluntarily left France to live in exile; like you, forced to leave due to many hardships, oppression, and misfortunes; like you, having to strive to make a living by your own efforts and believe in a brighter future; I only want to share in your hardships, share life and family with you, and remain loyal to you until death.</t2279> <t2280>Not to deprive Lucie of the privileges of being a daughter, a friend, a companion to you, but to help strengthen the bond between father and daughter even more, if it is possible to do so.</t2280>
<t2281>His hand still lingered on the doctor's hand.</t2281> <t2282>He held Darnay's hand for a moment to express his feelings, then rested both his hands on the armrest of the chair, and for the first time since they began talking, he looked up.</t2282> <t2283>On his face was a struggle; he was battling with the doubts and fears that occasionally arose in his mind.</t2283>
<t2284>− You speak very movingly and with great spirit, Charles Darnay, I thank you wholeheartedly, and I will also open my heart to you... or almost so.</t2284> <t2285>Do you have any reason to believe that Lucie loves you too? −</t2285> <t2286>Nothing.</t2286> <t2287>So far, there has been nothing.</t2287>
<t2288>− Is the main purpose of this conversation that you want to know Lucie's feelings through me? −</t2288> <t2289>Absolutely not.</t2289> <t2290>It will be many weeks before I dare hope for that; but I hope, whether right or wrong, that you will allow me to know by tomorrow.</t2290>
<t2291>− Do you need my advice? −</t2291> <t2292>No, sir.</t2292> <t2293>But I think you have every right to advise me on something, if you see fit, and I will listen.</t2293>
<t2294>− Do you need me to promise anything? −</t2294> <t2295>Yes, indeed I do.</t2295>
<t2296>− What? −</t2296> <t2297>You know very well that without you, I have no hope.</t2297>
<t2298>I understand clearly that even if at this moment there is an image of me in the innocent heart of Miss Manette, please do not think that I am presumptuous in assuming so, for I would still mean nothing if her father does not approve.</t2298>
<t2299>− Let's assume that's the case, but what if the reality is different? What do you think then? −</t2299> <t2300>I also understand clearly that a father's word expressing consent to someone pursuing her carries more weight than her own personal wishes and more than anything else in the world.</t2300> <t2301>For that reason, Doctor, - Darnay said humbly but firmly, - I do not wish to seek that word, even if it means my death.</t2301>
<t2302>− I believe you.</t2302> <t2303>Charles Darnay, but both the closest and the most distant feelings are full of secrets; in close cases, feelings are always delicate, discreet, and unpredictable. In this matter, my daughter Lucie is truly a mystery; I cannot know whose image resides in my daughter's heart.</t2303>
<t2304>− May I ask, if you think that she...</t2304> <t2305>- Seeing him hesitate, the father understood and continued speaking.</t2305>
<t2306>− Is there someone else pursuing you? −</t2306> <t2307>That's what I meant to say.</t2307>
<t2308>The father thought for a moment before answering: − You have already seen Mr. Carton coming to this house.</t2308> <t2309>Attorney Stryver also occasionally visits.</t2309> <t2310>If anyone is pursuing my daughter, it can only be one of those two.</t2310>
<t2311>− Or both, - Darnay said.</t2311>
<t2312>− I have never thought about either of them; I don't think that either of them has feelings for my daughter.</t2312> <t2313>Whatever you want me to promise, just say it.</t2313>
<t2314>− That is, if Miss Manette at some point voluntarily expresses feelings similar to those I have presumptuously shared with you, please recount what I have said and tell her that you believe in me.</t2314> <t2315>I hope you have a favorable opinion of me so that she won't be offended.</t2315> <t2316>That is the only thing I dare to ask.</t2316> <t2317>To achieve that, I am willing to accept any conditions that you are fully entitled to impose.</t2317>
<t2318>− I promise you unconditionally, - the doctor said.</t2318> <t2319>- I believe that what you say is sincere and noble.</t2319> <t2320>I believe your intention is to strengthen, not sever, the fatherly bond that ties me to my most beloved child.</t2320>
<t2321>If Lucie were to confess that you are an indispensable happiness, I would give my daughter to you. If...</t2321> <t2322>Charles Darnay, if there were...</t2322>
<t2323>The young man gratefully grasped the doctor's hand; they shook hands tightly while the father continued: − ... any thought, any reason, any fear, anything, old or new, against the person whom my daughter truly loves... anything for which that person is not directly responsible,... I will overlook all of it for my daughter's happiness.</t2323> <t2324>Lucie is my everything, more meaningful than all the suffering, more meaningful than all the injustices I have to endure, more meaningful than...</t2324> <t2325>Oh! Saying it is pointless.</t2325>
<t2326>The way the doctor fell into silence was truly strange, and the intense gaze he had when he stopped speaking was equally peculiar, to the point that Darnay noticed his hand growing cold in the hand that was slowly letting go of him.</t2326>
<t2327>− What did you just say to me? - Dr. Manette spoke, smiling.</t2327> <t2328>- What did you tell me?</t2328> <t2329>He didn't know how to respond until he suddenly remembered he had mentioned a condition.</t2329> <t2330>Feeling reassured, he replied: −</t2330> <t2331>Since you have trusted me so much, I must reciprocate with all my trust.</t2331> <t2332>My current name, though slightly altered from my mother's name as you know, is not my real name.</t2332> <t2333>I want to tell you my true identity and the reason I am in England.</t2333>
<t2334>− Don't! - The doctor in Beauvais exclaimed.</t2334>
<t2335>− I want it that way, to be more deserving of your trust. I don't want to hide anything from you.</t2335>
<t2336>− Don't!</t2336> <t2337>For a moment, the doctor even raised both hands to cover his ears; a moment later, those same hands were placed on Darnay's lips.</t2337>
<t2338>− When I ask, speak; do not speak now.</t2338> <t2339>If your pursuit is successful, if Lucie loves you, then you will inform me on the morning of the wedding day.</t2339> <t2340>Do you promise me that? −</t2340> <t2341>Willingly.</t2341>
<t2342>− Give me your hand.</t2342> <t2343>Lucie is coming back soon, and it's best if she doesn't see us meeting tonight.</t2343> <t2344>Go! God bless you! It was already dusk when Darnay left, and it was even darker an hour later when Lucie arrived home; she hurried alone into the living room - for Miss Pross had gone straight upstairs - and was surprised to see her father's armchair empty.</t2344>
<t2345>− Dad! - She called the doctor. - Dad?</t2345> <t2346>There was no answer, but she heard the faint sound of hammering coming from her father's bedroom. Gently walking around the adjacent room, she stood at the doorway and looked in, then in a panic, she ran back, silently lamenting, her heart aching. "What to do?</t2346> <t2347>What to do?" She hesitated for just a moment, then hurriedly went back to knock on the door and gently called her father.</t2347> <t2348>The hammering inside stopped immediately when her voice was heard, then the doctor came out to meet Lucie, and the father and daughter walked back and forth together for a long time.</t2348>
<t2349>That night, she left her bed and went down to her father's room to watch him sleep.</t2349> <t2350>His sleep was heavy, and the tray of shoemaking tools along with the half-finished shoe from long ago were laid out exactly as they had been in the past.</t2350>
<t2351>11.</t2351> <t2352>The prospect of marriage</t2352>
<t2353>− Sydney, pour another bowl of punch, - Stryver said to the Jackal that same night, or rather, early the next morning. - I have something to tell you.</t2353>
<t2354>Sydney has been working double shifts tonight, and the night before last, and the night before that, continuously for several nights to arrange for Stryver's paperwork before the long holiday begins.</t2354> <t2355>Finally, everything is done; Stryver's pending matters have been resolved properly; there are no more entanglements until November arrives with its gloomy skies, murky laws, and everything goes smoothly.</t2355>
<t2356>Sydney was neither excited nor more alert after all the grueling work.</t2356> <t2357>It took several more rounds of wet towels on his head to keep him awake through the night; and it also took about the same amount of weeks of drinking before applying the towels; now he looked truly miserable as he pulled the stack of towels off his head and tossed them into the basin he had been dipping them in every so often for the past six hours.</t2357>
<t2358>− Do you have another bowl of punch ready? - Stryver, lying on his back on the sofa with his hands hooked into his waistband, glanced around.</t2358>
<t2359>- Brewing.</t2359>
<t2360>− Hey, look here! I will tell you something very surprising, and maybe it will show you that I am not as wise as you often think.</t2360> <t2361>I intend to get married.</t2361>
<t2362>− Him? − Yes.</t2362> <t2363>And not because of money.</t2363> <t2364>What do you say now? −</t2364> <t2365>I don't know anything to say.</t2365> <t2366>Who is she? −</t2366> <t2367>Guess.</t2367>
<t2368>− Do I know them? −</t2368> <t2369>Guess.</t2369>
<t2370>− I won't guess, it's already five in the morning and my mind is boiling.</t2370> <t2371>If you want me to guess, you have to invite me to dinner.</t2371>
<t2372>− Alright then, let me speak, - Stryver said as he slowly shifted to a sitting position.</t2372> <t2373>- Sydney, it's a waste of time to explain to you, because you are truly insensitive.</t2373>
<t2374>− And you, - Sydney replied while still busy mixing punch, - truly have a sentimental and poetic soul...</t2374>
<t2375>− Stop it! - Stryver laughed arrogantly, - although I don't like to consider myself a romantic; because I hope I'm better than that, I am still the kind of person who has more feelings than you.</t2375>
<t2376>− You mean you're the luckier one, is that it.</t2376>
<t2377>− I didn't mean that.</t2377> <t2378>What I meant is that I am a person... a person..</t2378><t2379>.</t2379>
<t2380>− Then just say outright that he is more gallant, - Carton suggested.</t2380>
<t2381>− Ah! You could say it's gallant, - Stryver boasted to his friend who was mixing drinks.</t2381> <t2382>- What I mean is that, when it comes to women, I am someone who values making myself charming, someone who puts effort into being charming, someone who knows how to appear more charming than you.</t2382>
<t2383>− Go on, - Sydney Carton said.</t2383>
<t2384>− Wait a minute, - Stryver shook his head fiercely, - before continuing, I must finish this matter with you.</t2384> <t2385>You have been visiting Dr. Manette's house as frequently as I have, even more so. Oh, I'm really ashamed that you keep showing up there with that gloomy face!</t2385> <t2386>Your attitude is so silent, sullen, and gloomy that, I swear to you, I am ashamed of you, Sydney! −</t2386> <t2387>It's very good for a lawyer to feel ashamed, - Sydney said, - you should be thanking me.</t2387>
<t2388>− Don't try to change the subject like that, - Stryver retorted aggressively, speaking as if picking a fight. - No, Sydney, it is my duty to let you know; and I will tell it to your face to wake you up; that you are an unpleasant and grumpy person towards women.</t2388> <t2389>You are a detestable person.</t2389>
<t2390>Sydney drank a full glass of freshly made punch and then laughed out loud.</t2390>
<t2391>− Look at me! - Stryver said, puffing out his chest.</t2391> <t2392>- Being this rich and successful, I don't need to do much to be more charming than you.</t2392> <t2393>Why do I still try to be charming? −</t2393> <t2394>I've never seen you do that, - Carton mumbled.</t2394>
<t2395>− I do it because it is a strategy; it is my principle.</t2395> <t2396>And look at me! I have succeeded completely.</t2396>
<t2397>− You haven't finished talking about your marriage plans, - Carton said indifferently. - I hope you continue with that.</t2397> <t2398>As for me... don't you ever understand that I am incorrigible?</t2398> <t2399>The question revealed a hint of disdain.</t2399>
<t2400>− You don't have to act so incorrigible, - Stryver's voice was harsh.</t2400>
<t2401>− I have no need to put on airs, I know that, - Sydney Carton replied. - But who is that lady? −</t2401> <t2402>Now, don't get upset when I mention her name, Sydney, Stryver pretended to be friendly before revealing, - because I know you think one thing and say another; and even if you did say what you truly think, it wouldn't matter.</t2402> <t2403>I have to preface this a bit because you have previously spoken of that lady to me with disdain.</t2403>
<t2404>− Me? − Exactly; and right in this office.</t2404>
<t2405>Sydney Carton looked at the glass of wine and then at his complacent friend; he drained the glass and looked at his friend again.</t2405>
<t2406>− You once called that lady a blonde doll.</t2406> <t2407>That lady is Miss Manette.</t2407> <t2408>Sydney, if you had any delicate feelings or emotions towards women, I would have been upset by your contempt for her; but you are not that kind of person.</t2408> <t2409>You have no feelings at all; so being angry at you for saying that would be like being upset when someone without an eye for art criticizes my paintings, or someone without an ear for music criticizes my compositions.</t2409>
<t2410>Sydney Carton drank the liquor quickly; he finished a full glass, his eyes still on his friend.</t2410>
<t2411>− Now I've told you everything, Sydney, - Stryver continued.</t2411> <t2412>- I don't need wealth; she is a lovely person, and I have decided to seek happiness for myself; overall, I think I am well-qualified to be happy.</t2412> <t2413>She will have a wealthy husband in me; someone who is advancing quickly, someone with a bit of prestige; for her, having a husband like me is fortunate, but she also deserves to be fortunate.</t2413>
<t2414>Are you surprised? - Why should I be surprised? - Still drinking, Carton replied.</t2414>
<t2415>− Do you approve? Still drinking, Carton replied: − Why wouldn't I approve? − Very good! - Stryver said to his friend. - You received this news more easily than I thought, and thought less about my benefit than I expected; although by now you surely know that your old friend is someone who, once decided, will act.</t2415> <t2416>That's right, Sydney, I'm tired of this lifestyle, it's too monotonous; I think it's a good thing for a man to have a family so that if he wants, he can go home; if he doesn't want to, he doesn't have to; I think Miss Manette would please any husband and would make me proud.</t2416> <t2417>So I've made up my mind.</t2417> <t2418>And now, Sydney, my old chum, I want to say a few words to you about your future.</t2418> <t2419>You are mistaken, you are truly mistaken.</t2419> <t2420>You don't know the value of money, you live frugally, and one day you will find yourself in illness and poverty.</t2420> <t2421>You need to think about finding someone to take care of you.</t2421>
<t2422>The pompous and boastful manner of Stryver's speech made him twice as arrogant and four times as obnoxious.</t2422>
<t2423>− Listen, take my advice, - Stryver continued talking, - face the truth.</t2423> <t2424>I've faced the truth, in my own way; now you, face the truth in your way. Get married.</t2424> <t2425>Find someone to take care of you.</t2425> <t2426>Don't worry about not liking women, or not understanding them, or not being liked by them.</t2426> <t2427>Just find someone.</t2427> <t2428>Find a respectable woman with some property... a landlady or an innkeeper... and marry her, for when times get tough.</t2428> <t2429>That's your future.</t2429> <t2430>Think about it, Sydney.</t2430>
<t2431>− Let me think, - Sydney replied.</t2431>
<t2432>12.</t2432> <t2433>The Elegant Gentleman</t2433>
<t2434>Having wholeheartedly bestowed good fortune upon the doctor's daughter, Stryver decided to inform her of this joyous news before he left the city for an extended vacation.</t2434> <t2435>After some internal deliberation on the matter, he concluded that it would be best to handle the preliminary courtship immediately, and then arrange the wedding either during the regular court recess - either one or two weeks before the end of October or during the Christmas holiday.</t2435>
<t2436>Stryver viewed marriage as a lawsuit that he was sure to win and had already anticipated the court's verdict.</t2436> <t2437>If he had to persuade the jury based on material advantages—the only basis worth considering—this case clearly had no weaknesses.</t2437> <t2438>He imagined himself as the plaintiff's representative, with solid, irrefutable evidence, then the defendant's counsel throwing in the towel, and the jury not even needing to deliberate.</t2438> <t2439>After the trial, Stryver, now imagining himself as the Judge, was satisfied that no trial could be clearer.</t2439>
<t2440>So Stryver began the long vacation by formally inviting Miss Manette to go to Vauxhall Gardens, an invitation that was declined; he then invited her to Ranelagh Gardens, which was also inexplicably declined, so he had to personally make his way to Soho and declare his noble intentions there.</t2440>
<t2441>That is why Stryver hurriedly went from the Temple area to Soho just as the holiday had begun.</t2441> <t2442>Anyone who saw him rushing towards Soho when he was still on the Saint Dunstan side of the Temple Bar gate, sprinting on the sidewalk, brushing aside any weaker pedestrians in his path, would see how strong and confident Stryver was.</t2442>
<t2443>On the way past Tellson's Bank, since Stryver had both deposited money there and was acquainted with Mr. Lorry, who was close to the Manette family, he came up with the idea of entering the bank to inform him of the bright prospects on the horizon in Soho.</t2443> <t2444>So he pushed the creaky door open, dashed down two steps, passed by two extremely old cashiers, and then barged into the musty room at the back where Mr. Lorry was sitting with some large ledger books with columns, by a window with vertical iron bars as if the window frame itself was a ledger sheet and everything under the clouds was money.</t2444>
<t2445>− Hello! - Stryver said.</t2445> <t2446>- How are you?</t2446> <t2447>Hope you are doing well!</t2447> <t2448>Stryver had the notable characteristic of always seeming too grandiose in any space or place.</t2448> <t2449>He was so grandiose for Tellson that the old employees in the far corners had to look up with disapproving eyes as if they were being pushed against the wall by him.</t2449> <t2450>Even the Boss himself, who was majestically reading the newspaper in the farthest corner, had to reluctantly lower the paper as if Stryver had headbutted him in the stomach.</t2450>
<t2451>− Hello, Mr. Stryver. How are you? - Mr. Lorry responded tactfully with the exemplary tone he usually used in such circumstances.</t2451> <t2452>The way he shook hands was also unique, seen only when a Tellson employee shook hands with a customer in front of the Boss - a handshake that denied the self, representing only Tellson and the Corporation.</t2452>
<t2453>− How can I assist you, Mr. Stryver? - Mr. Lorry asked in a professional manner.</t2453>
<t2454>− Oh, no, thank you; this is just a personal visit, Mr. Lorry; I have a private matter to discuss with you.</t2454>
<t2455>− Oh really! - Mr. Lorry tilted his ear towards the guest while his gaze wandered towards the Boss in the distance.</t2455>
<t2456>− Here I am, - Stryver said confidently, placing his hands on a desk that was twice the size of a normal one but still seemed small before the grand Stryver, - here I am about to propose to your charming young friend, Miss Manette, Mr. Lorry.</t2456>
<t2457>− Oh my goodness! - Mr. Lorry exclaimed, rubbing his chin, his eyes doubtfully looking at the guest.</t2457>
<t2458>− Why should it be my death? - Stryver stepped back. - Or is it your death? What do you mean, Mr. Lorry? −</t2458> <t2459>What I mean is, - the man of business responded, - of course, in a friendly and appreciative manner, I mean that it is extremely well-deserved for you, and...</t2459>
<t2460>In short, my point is that I hope you achieve everything you desire.</t2460> <t2461>But...</t2461>
<t2462>To be honest, Mr. Stryver... - Mr. Lorry paused and then shook his head, looking at the guest in a very peculiar way, as if he was forced to speak against his own will, - you know very well that you are exceedingly grand! − Hmph! - Stryver pounded his hand on the table, eyes wide open, and took a deep breath.</t2462> <t2463>- Mr. Lorry, if I understand what you mean, hang me!</t2463> <t2464>Mr. Lorry adjusted the sides of his wig and bit the tip of the quill pen.</t2464>
<t2465>− Damn it! - Stryver stared - So I'm not worthy? −</t2465> <t2466>Oh no, you are! You are! Oh, you are very suitable! - Mr. Lorry said.</t2466> <t2467>If you are not suitable, then who is?</t2467>
<t2468>− So, am I not successful? - Stryver asked again.</t2468>
<t2469>− Oh! If you are not successful, then who else could be? - Mr. Lorry replied.</t2469>
<t2470>− And further advancement? −</t2470> <t2471>As for advancement, you needn't mention it, - Mr. Lorry was glad to have the opportunity to acknowledge once more, - no one could doubt that.</t2471>
<t2472>− So what the hell do you mean by that, Mr. Lorry? - Stryver asked, clearly flustered.</t2472>
<t2473>− Ah! I...</t2473> <t2474>Are you planning to go there now? - Mr. Lorry asked.</t2474>
<t2475>− Come immediately! - Stryver pounded his fist on the table.</t2475>
<t2476>− So if I were you, I think I wouldn't go.</t2476>
<t2477>− Why? - Stryver said. - Now you must tell me the truth.</t2477> <t2478>The index finger waved in front of the other person as if arguing in court.</t2478> <t2479>- You are a man of work, so you must have a reason.</t2479>
<t2480>You speak.</t2480> <t2481>Why don't you want to go? −</t2481> <t2482>Because, - Mr. Lorry replied, - I don't want to do it unless there's some evidence to believe that I will succeed.</t2482>
<t2483>− Damn it! - Stryver shouted. - I can't understand it at all! Mr. Lorry glanced at the Boss in the distance and then looked at the furious Stryver.</t2483>
<t2484>− This is a man of work... an elder person...</t2484> <t2485>a person full of experience... in the bank, - Stryver said, - and after summarizing the three main reasons for my success, he then said there was no evidence to believe that!</t2485> <t2486>And he said it so calmly! - Stryver emphasized the last sentence as if it would be extremely surprising if Mr. Lorry had said it while out of his mind.</t2486>
<t2487>− When I speak of success, I mean success with that lady; and when I speak of reasons for potential success, I mean reasons that are persuasive to that lady.</t2487> <t2488>Think of that lady, sir, - Mr. Lorry said while gently tapping Stryver's arm, - think about it.</t2488> <t2489>The lady's wishes are what matter most.</t2489>
<t2490>− Mr. Lorry, are you trying to tell me that, - Stryver spread his elbows, - you mean to say that the young lady we are talking about is a capricious fool? −</t2490> <t2491>Not exactly, Mr. Stryver, - Mr. Lorry blushed. - I want to tell you that I do not want to hear anyone utter any disrespectful words about that young lady; if I know of anyone; I hope there is none; whose rude behavior and arrogant nature lead them to speak disrespectfully about that young lady right at my desk, then not even Tellson's Bank could stop me from giving them a good scolding.</t2491>
<t2492>The act of being angry but having to speak in a restrained tone caused Stryver's blood vessels to dangerously swell when he got heated; Mr. Lorry's blood vessels, normally not visible, now also bulged when it was his turn.</t2492>
<t2493>− That's what I mean, sir, - Mr. Lorry said.</t2493> <t2494>- Please don't misunderstand me.</t2494>
<t2495>Stryver put the end of the ruler in his mouth, sucked on it for a while, and then tapped the ruler against his teeth in a rhythm that probably made them ache.</t2495>
<t2496>Stryver broke the silence: − I find this strange, Mr. Lorry.</t2496> <t2497>You deliberately advise me not to go to Soho to propose; I, Stryver of the High Court Bar.</t2497>
<t2498>− Do you want to hear my advice, Mr. Stryver? −</t2498> <t2499>Yes, I want to hear it.</t2499>
<t2500>− Very good.</t2500> <t2501>So, you just heard me say that, and you just repeated it exactly.</t2501>
<t2502>− Well, all I can say is... ha ha, - Stryver laughed irritably, - this matter is really... ha ha... incomprehensible, both past, present, and future.</t2502>
<t2503>− Now listen to me, - Mr. Lorry continued. - As a man of business, I have no right to speak about this personal matter; as a man of business, I don't know how to talk about this matter.</t2503> <t2504>But I speak as an old man who once held Miss Manette in his arms when she was a child, as a trusted friend of both Miss Manette and her father, and as someone who deeply loves them both.</t2504> <t2505>It was you who came here to ask my opinion, remember that.</t2505>
<t2506>Now you think I'm wrong, don't you? −</t2506> <t2507>Not at all! - Stryver hissed.</t2507> <t2508>- I can't understand the common reasoning of others; I only understand my own reasoning.</t2508> <t2509>I believe I'm right on some issues, while you believe in nonsensical and trivial matters.</t2509> <t2510>It's strange, but you're right, I suppose.</t2510>
<t2511>− I believe in the things that I personally consider to be right, Mr. Stryver...</t2511>
<t2512>Please understand, - Mr. Lorry blushed again, I do not allow... even here at Tellson's... anyone to speak on my behalf.</t2512>
<t2513>− Look! I apologize to you! - Stryver exclaimed.</t2513>
<t2514>− I pass. Thank you.</t2514> <t2515>Hey, Mr. Stryver, what I meant to say is... it might be distressing for you if you find yourself mistaken, it might be distressing for Dr. Manette to have to speak frankly with you, and it might be very distressing for Miss Manette to have to speak frankly with you.</t2515> <t2516>I have the honor and good fortune to be close to that family, you know.</t2516> <t2517>If you allow, I will try to observe and consider more clearly to give you more accurate advice without harming your intention to propose, or having to speak on your behalf.</t2517> <t2518>After that, if you are not satisfied with my advice, you can investigate for yourself; on the other hand, if you find that what I say aligns with what I have just mentioned, then both sides can avoid unpleasant matters.</t2518> <t2519>What do you think? −</t2519> <t2520>How long do I have to stay in this city waiting for you? − Oh! Just a few hours.</t2520> <t2521>This afternoon I can go to Soho and then to your office.</t2521>
<t2522>− Then I agree, - Stryver said. - Now I will not go there anymore, I am not in a hurry to go there right away; I agree, and I will wait for you to come by tonight.</t2522> <t2523>Goodbye, sir.</t2523>
<t2524>So Stryver turned his back and dashed out of the bank, creating such a strong gust of wind behind him that the two elderly clerks, who were bowing deeply behind the two counters, had to muster all their strength just to stay upright.</t2524> <t2525>People always saw those feeble dignitaries bent over, and everyone believed that once they bowed to bid farewell to a client, they would remain hunched like that in the empty bank until they had to greet another client.</t2525>
<t2526>This lawyer was shrewd enough to understand that the old man in the bank would never reveal so much if he didn't have a solid basis to believe in what he was saying.</t2526> <t2527>Those unexpected words were indeed a bitter pill too large for him to swallow, but he managed to swallow it.</t2527> <t2528>Once he had swallowed it, Stryver wagged his index finger as if arguing in court with the entire Temple Bar and silently threatened: "Now, the way out of this is to prove you are all wrong."</t2528> <t2529>That was a little trick of courtroom tactics at the Old Bailey that often saved him during litigation.</t2529> <t2530>Stryver reassured himself: "You won't be able to prove that I'm wrong, miss, I will prove that you are wrong."</t2530> <t2531>Therefore, when Mr. Lorry came to the office at ten o'clock in the evening, Stryver was sitting amidst a clutter of books and papers, seemingly no longer concerned with the morning's events.</t2531> <t2532>He even appeared surprised to see Mr. Lorry and received the guest with the distracted demeanor of a busy person.</t2532>
<t2533>− Oh! - The kind-hearted marriage envoy, after half an hour of futilely steering the conversation towards this topic, had to remind. - I have arrived at Soho.</t2533>
<t2534>− To Soho? - Stryver asked nonchalantly. - Oh, of course! Where was my mind? −</t2534> <t2535>And I am certain, - Mr. Lorry said, - that I was right when we talked this morning.</t2535> <t2536>My opinion has been confirmed, and I repeat that advice.</t2536>
<t2537>− I assure you, - Stryver replied, in a friendly tone, - I feel sorry for you and also for that poor father.</t2537> <t2538>I understand that this matter must be very awkward for that family; let us not talk about it anymore.</t2538>
<t2539>− I don't understand your point, - Mr. Lorry said.</t2539>
<t2540>− Probably not, - Stryver nodded with a comfortable and decisive demeanor, not important, not important.</t2540>
<t2541>− But this matter is indeed important, - Mr. Lorry emphasized.</t2541>
<t2542>− Not at all; I assure you, not at all.</t2542> <t2543>After mistakenly believing there was reason where there was none, and mistakenly believing there was noble aspiration where there was none, I realized my error and suffered no harm.</t2543> <t2544>Young ladies often make similar foolish mistakes and often regret them when they find themselves in poverty and darkness.</t2544> <t2545>For the person in question, I regret that this did not come to pass, because if it had, it would have been a misfortune for me, from a material gain perspective; but for myself, I am glad it did not come to pass, because if it had, it would also have been a misfortune for me, from a material gain perspective... needless to say, I would have gained nothing.</t2545> <t2546>No harm has occurred.</t2546> <t2547>I have not proposed to that young lady, and just between you and me, looking back, I am not even sure if I need to get married that much.</t2547> <t2548>Mr. Lorry, you cannot control the whimsical and capricious nature of empty-headed girls; do not dream of it if you do not want to be disappointed.</t2548>
<t2549>Now please don't say anything about that anymore.</t2549> <t2550>I've already said it, I feel sorry for them but happy for myself.</t2550> <t2551>And I am very grateful to you for allowing me to ask for advice and for advising me; you understand that lady better than I do; you were right, this marriage will never happen.</t2551>
<t2552>Mr. Lorry was so astonished that he stood gaping at Stryver, who was aggressively pushing him towards the door, the barrister's face appearing to bestow upon the misguided man all his goodwill, patience, and tolerance.</t2552>
<t2553>− Handle it yourself, dear sir, - Stryver said.</t2553> <t2554>- Don't mention this again; thank you once more for letting me ask your opinion; goodbye!</t2554> <t2555>Before he could understand anything, Mr. Lorry was thrown out into the night.</t2555>
<t2556>Stryver lay down on the sofa, winking at the ceiling.</t2556>
<t2557>13.</t2557> <t2558>The Rude Guy</t2558>
<t2559>If Sydney Carton ever shone anywhere, he certainly never shone at Dr. Manette's house.</t2559> <t2560>He had been visiting for a whole year, always bringing a gloomy, dejected, and disheartened face there.</t2560> <t2561>Whenever he wanted to talk, he spoke very well; but the indifferent look, like a cloud enveloping him in sorrowful darkness, was rarely pierced by the light in his heart.</t2561>
<t2562>However, he needed something from the neighborhood surrounding that house, the lifeless paving stones on the sidewalk there.</t2562> <t2563>Many nights he wandered around there, suffering and aimless, when the alcohol brought him no fleeting joy; many gloomy dawns also saw his lonely figure lingering there, still hesitating to leave as the first rays of sunlight highlighted the architectural beauty of the church spires and high-rise buildings, just as this quiet moment made his mind perceive better things that had been forgotten or were out of reach.</t2563> <t2564>Recently, the rumpled bed in Temple Court rarely lulled him to sleep; often he would throw himself onto the bed only to get up a few minutes later and wander to that neighborhood.</t2564>
<t2565>One August day, when Stryver was graciously allowed to go on vacation in Devonshire (after informing his friend the Jackal that he had "reconsidered and decided not to pursue marriage"), when the scenery and the fragrance of flowers on the streets bestowed a bit of goodness on the most unfortunate, a bit of health on the most ailing, and a bit of youth on the oldest, Sydney's steps once again wandered on the sidewalk.</t2565> <t2566>From hesitance and aimlessness, his steps gradually quickened with a newly formed intention, and to carry it out, his steps led him to the doctor's house.</t2566>
<t2567>He was invited upstairs and saw Lucie alone with her needlework.</t2567> <t2568>She had never felt comfortable interacting with Sydney, greeting him with a bit of awkwardness as he sat down near the sewing table.</t2568> <t2569>But just after looking up and saying a few initial pleasantries, she immediately noticed his expression change.</t2569>
<t2570>− You don't seem well, Mr. Carton! − That's right.</t2570> <t2571>But Miss Manette, living like I do, how could I be well?</t2571> <t2572>What is there to hope for in this wasted life?</t2572> <t2573>Isn't it... forgive me for saying this,... isn't it a pity to live like that? −</t2573> <t2574>By God, life is truly miserable! −</t2574> <t2575>Then why not change it? She looked at him gently, both surprised and saddened to see the tears in his eyes.</t2575> <t2576>His voice was choked as he replied: − It's too late.</t2576> <t2577>I'll never get any better.</t2577> <t2578>I'll only become more and more degraded, worse and worse.</t2578>
<t2579>He propped one elbow on the table, raising his hand to cover his eyes.</t2579> <t2580>The tabletop trembled in the ensuing silence.</t2580>
<t2581>She had never seen him so weak and miserable.</t2581> <t2582>Without even looking, she knew that she felt sorry for him.</t2582> <t2583>Sydney said: − Excuse me, Miss Manette.</t2583> <t2584>I am distressed because of what I want to confess to you.</t2584> <t2585>Would you be willing to listen to me? −</t2585> <t2586>If it would make you feel better, Mr. Carton, if it would make you happier, I would very much like to hear it! −</t2586> <t2587>You are so kind, may God bless you! After a moment, he removed his hand from his face and said, his voice calmer: −</t2587> <t2588>Do not be afraid of what I am about to say.</t2588> <t2589>Please do not be apprehensive about what I say.</t2589> <t2590>I am like someone who has died prematurely.</t2590> <t2591>My whole life may have been wasted.</t2591>
<t2592>− No, Mr. Carton.</t2592> <t2593>I am certain that the best things will come; I am certain that you will be prouder, more confident in yourself.</t2593>
<t2594>− You are very kind, Miss Manette, but I understand myself better; although from the depths of this sorrow I know that it is not true; but I will never forget your kind words! Lucie turned pale and trembled.</t2594> <t2595>Sydney tried to reassure her, but his attitude of desperate self-deprecation only made the conversation more peculiar.</t2595>
<t2596>− Miss Manette, suppose you were to reciprocate the love of the man standing before you; a worthless, drunken, poor, misguided man whom you have known; then today, at this very moment, he knows well that instead of bringing you happiness, he would bring you hardship and poverty, bring you sorrow and regret, he would ruin you, disgrace you, and drag you down to the depths with him.</t2596> <t2597>I know well that you have no feelings for me and I do not ask for that; in fact, I am even more grateful that it cannot happen.</t2597>
<t2598>− But without that, can't I help you, Mr. Carton? Can't I help you return... forgive me for saying this again!... return to a better path?</t2598> <t2599>Is there no way I can repay your trust?</t2599> <t2600>I know you trust me, - she said humbly after a moment of hesitation, with sincere tears in her eyes.</t2600> <t2601>- I know you wouldn't say this to anyone else.</t2601>
<t2602>Can't you turn that trust into something good for me, Carton? He shook his head.</t2602>
<t2603>− No way, Miss Manette, no way.</t2603> <t2604>If you are willing to listen to me a little more, you have already helped me immensely.</t2604> <t2605>I want you to understand that you have been the last hope of my life.</t2605> <t2606>No matter how lowly I am, I am not so blind as to not see the scene of you and your father together, to see this house become a home thanks to your hands, which has rekindled in me so many things I thought I had forgotten forever.</t2606> <t2607>Since I met you, I have been tormented by a regret that I thought had long been exhausted, I have heard whispers that I thought had forever fallen silent, reminding me to turn back from my wayward path.</t2607> <t2608>I have vaguely thought about trying to change, to start my life anew, to cast off my debauched and stagnant life, and to continue the struggle for existence.</t2608> <t2609>A dream, just a dream, leads nowhere, and it leaves the dreamer lying there, but I want you to understand that it was you who sparked those thoughts in me.</t2609>
<t2610>− Are those things over now?</t2610> <t2611>Oh Mr. Carton, please reconsider! Try harder! −</t2611> <t2612>No, Miss Manette, I have long known that I am completely unworthy.</t2612> <t2613>I know I am weak and cannot improve, but I want you to know that you suddenly have the power to ignite the ashes that I am into a flame... but that flame cannot escape my nature, it cannot drive anything, it cannot illuminate anything, it cannot help anything, and it will gradually die out.</t2613>
<t2614>− Carton, unfortunately, I have made you feel more unhappy than before you met me...</t2614>
<t2615>− Don't say that, Miss Manette, if I can still be saved, only you can do it.</t2615> <t2616>You are not the reason I have become worse.</t2616>
<t2617>− Because my mood, as I mentioned, is partly influenced by you... I don't know if you understand what I mean... is there really nothing you can do to help me?</t2617> <t2618>Is there really nothing you can do to bring something good to me? −</t2618> <t2619>Miss Manette, the best thing I can do now is what I have done right here.</t2619> <t2620>Just let me live out this misguided life while always remembering today, the day I opened my heart to you, the only person in the world, and the day I realized I still have something worthy of your compassion.</t2620>
<t2621>− I earnestly and wholeheartedly ask you to believe, and always believe, that you can make your life better, Mr. Carton! −</t2621> <t2622>Please do not expect me to believe that, Miss Manette.</t2622> <t2623>I know myself better than anyone else.</t2623> <t2624>I have caused you concern, so I will end this conversation quickly.</t2624> <t2625>I only hope you will allow me to believe that later, when you remember today, the final confidences I have entrusted to your innocent and pure soul will remain secret, known to no one else, will you? −</t2625> <t2626>Yes, if that helps put your mind at ease.</t2626>
<t2627>− Even your dearest loved ones should not know? − Mr. Carton, - the girl replied after a moment of confused silence, - the secret is yours, not mine, and I promise to keep it.</t2627>
<t2628>− Thank you, miss. Once again, may God bless you.</t2628>
<t2629>He kissed her hand goodbye, then walked to the door.</t2629>
<t2630>− Please don't worry, Miss Manette, I will never speak of this matter again, not even a single word.</t2630> <t2631>I will not mention it again, from now on.</t2631> <t2632>This promise is more certain than my own death.</t2632> <t2633>I will carry this sacred memory with me to my grave... and I will be grateful to you, I will bless you... the one with the gentle heart who accepted my final confession, who accepted my honor, my faults, and my sorrows.</t2633>
<t2634>Wishing you always happiness and peace!</t2634> <t2635>Sydney Carton behaved nothing like he used to before, how sad it is to think about the life he squandered, the many days wasted in debauchery.</t2635> <t2636>Lucie Manette couldn't hold back a sorrowful cry as he looked back.</t2636>
<t2637>− Please stay calm! - He said.</t2637> <t2638>- I am not worthy of your tears, Miss Manette.</t2638> <t2639>In one or two hours, when my lowly friends and those despicable but irresistible vices welcome me back, I will be even less deserving of these tears, worse than the wretches on the streets.</t2639> <t2640>Please stay calm!</t2640> <t2641>But in my heart, I will always be the person I am now to you, even though outwardly I will remain the person you have seen all along.</t2641> <t2642>The last thing I earnestly ask of you is to believe my words.</t2642>
<t2643>− I believe, Mr. Carton.</t2643>
<t2644>− I only request this one thing, and now I will free you from a guest whom I know is entirely incompatible with you, there is an immense distance between him and you.</t2644> <t2645>It is pointless to say, I know, but these words come from the bottom of my heart.</t2645> <t2646>I am willing to do everything for you, and for anyone you love.</t2646> <t2647>If in the journey of life I still have any chance or ability to sacrifice for you and for your loved ones, I will do so without hesitation.</t2647> <t2648>Please remember me, in those moments of peace, and believe these sincere and earnest words.</t2648> <t2649>The time will come, not long from now, when the bonds of marriage will connect you with someone... the bond will gently and firmly bind you to the home that you will adorn with beauty... the beloved bond will bring you many blessings and joys.</t2649> <t2650>Oh Miss Manette, when the shadow of happiness of the father is the little boy looking up at you, when your lovely face is mirrored in the little girl growing up beside you, please occasionally remember that there is someone willing to trade his life to protect another life that you love! He says “Goodbye!” and utters for the last time “God bless you!” then leaves.</t2650>
<t2651>14.</t2651> <t2652>An honest businessman</t2652>
<t2653>Carriages and horses flowed like water, and clothes were packed like sardines, passing daily before the eyes of Jeremiah Cruncher, who was sitting on a stool on the pavement of Fleet Street with a ghastly little brat beside him.</t2653> <t2654>If it weren't for that father and son, who else could sit on Fleet Street during the bustling hours of the day without being dazzled and deafened by the two endless parades, one heading west following the sun, the other fleeing east away from the sun, both endlessly moving towards the distant fields beyond the multicolored twilight!</t2654> <t2655>With a straw in his mouth, Cruncher sat watching the two streams of movement like an ancient ferryman eternally tasked with guarding the river of the underworld - except he never wished for this flow to dry up.</t2655> <t2656>If it dried up, what would there be to look forward to, because a small part of his income came from leading timid women (most of whom were encumbered with cumbersome clothing and well past their prime) from the Tellson's side across the traffic to the other side.</t2656> <t2657>Each time he escorted them, no matter how brief, Cruncher managed to befriend the ladies to express his desire to have the honor of raising a glass to their health.</t2657> <t2658>And the small sums of money the ladies gave him when he performed this charitable act were an additional source of income, and that was why he sat there observing.</t2658>
<t2659>There was a time when poets often sat on benches, dreamily watching people pass by in public places.</t2659> <t2660>Also sitting on a bench in a public place, but not a poet, Cruncher looked around, trying to be as little dreamy as possible.</t2660>
<t2661>It turned out that he was encountering a time when the streets were not crowded, devoid of slow ladies, and when business was not thriving, he began to suspect that his wife Cruncher at home must be "sitting down" cursing him; at that moment, he saw an unusual crowd pouring down Fleet Street heading west.</t2661> <t2662>Straining his eyes to look, Cruncher recognized a funeral procession coming, followed by a noisy crowd.</t2662>
<t2663>− Jerry, son, - Cruncher turned to his son, - there's a funeral.</t2663>
<t2664>− Hooray, Dad! - little Jerry shouted.</t2664>
<t2665>The son uttered those words of joy with an air of mysterious importance.</t2665> <t2666>The father was annoyed by this, so he waited for a moment when no one was paying attention and then gave his son a slap.</t2666>
<t2667>− What are you up to?</t2667> <t2668>What are you cheering for? Are you mocking your father, you little rascal? I can't stand you anymore!</t2668> <t2669>Cruncher stared at his son. - How dare you cheer? If I hear it again, you'll get another slap.</t2669> <t2670>Do you hear me? − I didn't do anything wrong, - young Jerry protested while rubbing his cheek.</t2670>
<t2671>− Shut up, - Cruncher said, - I don't care what you did wrong.</t2671> <t2672>Just sit in that chair and watch people.</t2672>
<t2673>The boy obeyed and the crowd moved forward; the masses shouted and screamed around a dark hearse and a dark funeral carriage, on which there was only one person, dressed in the somber attire essential for this solemn role.</t2673> <t2674>But the funeral conductor was not at all pleased with this role as the crowd around the carriage grew increasingly chaotic, mocking him, frowning at him, and incessantly criticizing and shouting “Hey!</t2674> <t2675>Spy! Hiss! Hey hey! Spy!” along with countless other unbearably harsh praises that cannot be recounted.</t2675>
<t2676>Funerals always had a great attraction for Cruncher; he would always strain his eyes and ears and become excited whenever a funeral passed by Tellson's.</t2676> <t2677>So a funeral with an unusually large number of attendants like this one made him extremely happy, and he immediately asked the first person he came across: −</t2677> <t2678>What's this, mate? What's going on? −</t2678> <t2679>I don't know, - the other person said.</t2679> <t2680>- Spy! Hey hey! Hiss! Spy! Cruncher asked another person: − Who died? − I don't know, - this person replied the same way but cupped his hands around his mouth to make a megaphone and shouted enthusiastically and strangely energetically, - Spy! Hey hey! Hiss, hiss!</t2680> <t2681>Spyyyy...!</t2681> <t2682>It was only after a while that Cruncher met someone who knew the real situation and found out that this funeral was for a certain Roger Cly.</t2682>
<t2683>− Is this guy a spy? - Cruncher asked.</t2683>
<t2684>− The spy at the Old Bailey, - the knowledgeable person informed.</t2684>
<t2685>− Hey hey! Stop! Hey! The spy from Old Baiiiii... ley! − Ah, that's right! - Jerry exclaimed as he recalled the trial he had participated in before.</t2685> <t2686>- I have met this guy before.</t2686> <t2687>Is he dead? −</t2687> <t2688>Dead as a doornail, - the other replied, - stone cold dead.</t2688> <t2689>Drag them out here! Spies!</t2689> <t2690>Tear them apart! Spies! This idea was too easily accepted when no one could think of anything else, so the crowd eagerly seized it, shouting and repeating the suggestion to drag and tear apart, while crowding around so tightly that the two carriages couldn't move an inch.</t2690> <t2691>When the crowd managed to open the door of the funeral carriage, the only person in mourning attire frantically jumped out and was caught for a moment; but he was too quick and knew how to take advantage of the situation, so in a flash, he escaped into an alley after discarding his coat, hat, long mourning band, white handkerchief in his pocket, and even the symbolic tears.</t2691>
<t2692>These mourning clothes were joyfully torn to pieces by the crowd and scattered everywhere while the shopkeepers hastily closed their stores; for at that time the crowd would not hesitate before anything and was as terrifying as a monstrous tyrant.</t2692> <t2693>The crowd had gone so mad that they opened the hearse door intending to pull out the coffin when a genius, smarter than the rest, came up with the idea to leave it as it was and all together escort the hearse to its final destination to celebrate the funeral.</t2693> <t2694>Any practical suggestion was necessary, so everyone enthusiastically accepted this proposal, and the hearse immediately became crowded with eight people squeezing inside, a dozen clinging outside; while the hearse also bore about the same number of people climbing on the roof and a bunch skillfully hanging around it in every possible way.</t2694> <t2695>Among the first volunteers was Jerry Cruncher, who timidly hid his spiky hair in the farthest corner of the hearse so that the people from Tellson's Bank wouldn't see him.</t2695>
<t2696>The official employees of the funeral home opposed the change in funeral rites; but the river was alarmingly close, and many in the crowd noted that using cold water would effectively calm any stubborn staff member, so the funeral home staff only weakly and briefly protested.</t2696> <t2697>The funeral continued with the new rites, a chimney sweep took control of the hearse - under the guidance of the actual driver sitting precariously beside him to closely supervise the task - while a street vendor, also with an assistant advisor, drove the funeral carriage.</t2697> <t2698>A bear trainer, a popular street performer of the time, was also enlisted as an additional decoration before the procession reached Strand Street; and his mangy black bear was the only one in the procession with a genuinely mournful expression.</t2698>
<t2699>So, while drinking beer, smoking, singing loudly, and making all sorts of sorrowful and mocking gestures, the chaotic crowd kept moving forward, constantly drawing more people to join, and wherever they went, all the shops would shut their doors tightly.</t2699> <t2700>The destination was the old Saint Pancras church, far out in the fields.</t2700> <t2701>The crowd eventually arrived, everyone poured into the cemetery; and finally, they completed the burial of the late Roger Cly in the manner they wanted, and everyone was satisfied.</t2701>
<t2702>The dead had been buried, and the crowd now needed to find new entertainment for themselves. A brilliant mind (or perhaps the same person from earlier) came up with the fun idea of accusing passersby of being spies at the Old Bailey and venting their hatred on them.</t2702> <t2703>Dozens of innocent people who had never set foot near the Old Bailey were chased, knocked down, and assaulted.</t2703> <t2704>From this game, it was an easy and natural progression to smashing windows and then looting pubs.</t2704> <t2705>Eventually, hours later, when many summer houses had been torn down and many fences had been broken to make weapons for the more belligerent, a rumor spread that the guards were coming.</t2705> <t2706>Upon hearing this news, the crowd gradually dispersed, and whether the guards came or not, this was the usual course of events for a frenzied mob.</t2706>
<t2707>Cruncher did not participate in the post-funeral entertainments but stayed in the cemetery to chat and comfort the undertaker's staff.</t2707> <t2708>This place made him feel at ease.</t2708> <t2709>He got a pipe from a nearby pub and smoked while observing the surrounding fence, carefully examining the location.</t2709>
<t2710>“Jerry,” Cruncher muttered to himself again out of habit.</t2710>
<t2711>"That day you already saw that guy Cly."</t2711> <t2712>"You saw with your own eyes that he was a young and decent man."</t2712> <t2713>After finishing his pipe and pondering a bit more, he also returned to make sure he was at the same spot before Tellson's closed.</t2713> <t2714>It was unclear whether his thoughts about death had affected his inner courage or his overall health had been unstable recently, or if he just wanted to show some care to a respectable person; either way, on his way back, he stopped by the doctor's house - a well-known surgeon.</t2714>
<t2715>Jerry's son sat in for his father out of duty, reporting that there was no work at all during his father's absence.</t2715> <t2716>The bank closed, the old decrepit clerks left, the night watchman arrived, and Cruncher and his son went home for tea.</t2716>
<t2717>− Hey, I'm telling you! - As soon as he walked in, Cruncher immediately spoke to his wife. - I'm an honest worker, and if my job tonight fails, it's definitely because you've cursed me. Even if I don't see with my own eyes what you're doing, I'll still give you a beating as usual.</t2717>
<t2718>Mrs. Cruncher shook her head in despair.</t2718>
<t2719>− Oh, you dare to do that in front of me! - Cruncher exclaimed, his voice both angry and worried.</t2719>
<t2720>− I didn't say anything.</t2720>
<t2721>− Hmph, then don't think about anything.</t2721> <t2722>If you're not sitting down praying, you're scheming something.</t2722> <t2723>One way or another, you're always cursing me.</t2723> <t2724>Stop it all, you hear?</t2724>
<t2725>− Yes, sir.</t2725>
<t2726>− Yes, - Cruncher kept repeating as he sat down for tea.</t2726> <t2727>Well! Yes.</t2727> <t2728>Alright. Allow her to say "yes."</t2728>
<t2729>Cruncher's grumblings didn't have any clear meaning, but he kept talking, just like everyone else does when they generally express sarcastic dissatisfaction.</t2729>
<t2730>− Just say yes, - Cruncher took a bite of buttered bread and swallowed it quickly as if gulping down a large invisible oyster that had just been shucked.</t2730> <t2731>- Ah! That works too.</t2731> <t2732>I trust you.</t2732>
<t2733>− Are you going out tonight? - The kind wife asked as the husband took another bite.</t2733>
<t2734>− Yes, there is.</t2734>
<t2735>− Can I come with you, Dad? - The boy quickly suggested.</t2735>
<t2736>− No, that's not possible.</t2736> <t2737>I have to go... your mother knows it,... go fishing.</t2737>
<t2738>I have to go there.</t2738> <t2739>Go fishing.</t2739>
<t2740>− Dad, your fishing rod is a bit rusty, isn't it? −</t2740> <t2741>Let it be.</t2741>
<t2742>− Dad, will you bring the fish home? −</t2742> <t2743>If I don't bring it home, you'll go hungry tomorrow, - the father replied, shaking his head.</t2743> <t2744>- Enough questions; as long as you haven't gone to bed and fallen asleep, I won't go anywhere.</t2744>
<t2745>Throughout the rest of the evening, Cruncher did nothing but watch his wife very closely, constantly engaging her in conversation to prevent her from plotting or praying for any misfortune to befall him.</t2745> <t2746>Therefore, Cruncher urged his son to talk to his mother as well, tormenting the poor woman with all sorts of complaints and grievances, not allowing her a single moment of peace for private thoughts.</t2746> <t2747>The most devout person who believes in the efficacy of sincere prayers could not believe more than Cruncher did that his wife only wished ill for her husband.</t2747>
<t2748>It's no different from someone who claims not to believe in ghosts but gets scared out of their wits when hearing ghost stories.</t2748>
<t2749>− That's urine! - Cruncher said. - Don't try any tricks tomorrow! If this honest man brings back some pieces of meat, don't you two start complaining and refuse to eat the meat, only swallowing plain bread.</t2749>
<t2750>This honest man here, if he brings home some beer, don't just pretend to drink plain water.</t2750> <t2751>When in Rome, do as the Romans do.</t2751> <t2752>If you don't follow the customs, the host will kick you out of the house.</t2752> <t2753>I am the host here, got it!</t2753> <t2754>Then he started grumbling again: −</t2754> <t2755>Food and drinks are served right to your mouth and you still complain!</t2755> <t2756>I don't understand why I have to work so hard to earn food and drinks, just because of your habit of sitting around praying and living immorally.</t2756> <t2757>Look at your son!</t2757> <t2758>Is he really your son? He's so skinny.</t2758> <t2759>You call yourself a mother but don't know that the first duty of a mother is to fatten up her child?</t2759> <t2760>That statement hit Jerry Jr.'s sore spot, so he insisted that his mother fulfill this first duty, and regardless of whether she fulfilled any other duties, the most important thing was to show truly touching and delicious maternal love as his father had instructed.</t2760>
<t2761>The evening passed with the Cruncher family like that, until young Jerry was made to go to bed and his mother had to follow the same order.</t2761> <t2762>Cruncher sat alone, smoking several pipes to pass the time, waiting until nearly one in the morning before setting out.</t2762> <t2763>At that dark, late hour, he got up from his chair, took a key from his pocket, opened a cupboard, and pulled out a sack, a large crowbar, ropes with chains, and other tools needed for this special fishing trip.</t2763> <t2764>After skillfully tucking, wrapping, wearing, and hooking all those items around himself, Cruncher gave his wife a grumbling farewell, extinguished the light, and left.</t2764>
<t2765>Little Jerry, who had been pretending to change clothes and lie down, immediately got up and followed.</t2765> <t2766>Hidden in the darkness, he followed his father out of the room, down the stairs, into the yard, and then onto the street.</t2766> <t2767>Returning to this house was not difficult for him because the house was full of tenants and the door was ajar all night.</t2767>
<t2768>Driven by the commendable aspiration to learn the honest craft secrets of his father, young Jerry kept close to the house fronts, walls, and doorsteps as he walked, his eyes always closely following his esteemed father.</t2768> <t2769>As for the esteemed father, he had just headed a short distance north when he encountered another night fisherman, and the two proceeded together.</t2769>
<t2770>After half an hour, they passed through the area with flickering streetlights and the patrol guards who had already closed their eyes, and then reached the deserted road.</t2770> <t2771>Here, they picked up another fisherman - so silently that if Jerry were superstitious, he would have thought the leisurely fisherman from earlier had suddenly split into two.</t2771>
<t2772>The three men continued walking and Jerry followed them until the three fishermen stopped under a bank that jutted out close to the road.</t2772> <t2773>On the bank was a low brick wall with an iron fence.</t2773> <t2774>In the darkness of the bank and the fence, the three men left the main road and turned into a dead-end alley beside the fence - which was up to three meters high in some places.</t2774> <t2775>Huddled in a dark corner, looking into the alley, young Jerry immediately saw the figure of his esteemed father clearly illuminated in the dim moonlight, swiftly climbing up the iron gate.</t2775> <t2776>His father climbed over quickly, followed by the second fisherman, then the third.</t2776> <t2777>All three gently jumped down to the ground inside the gate and lay still for a while - perhaps listening.</t2777> <t2778>Then they crawled away on their hands and knees.</t2778>
<t2779>Now it's Jerry's turn to sneak to the gate; he holds his breath and creeps forward.</t2779>
<t2780>Retreating into a dark corner to look, it noticed the shadows of three people fishing, crawling through the thick grass, surrounded by tombstones - they were in a vast cemetery - the white tombstones like ghosts and the church tower rising high like the ghost of a giant monster.</t2780>
<t2781>The three people crawled a short distance and then stood up.</t2781> <t2782>And they began their night fishing.</t2782>
<t2783>At first, they fished with a shovel.</t2783> <t2784>After that, Jerry's revered father seemed to be adjusting some tool that resembled a gigantic corkscrew.</t2784> <t2785>No matter what tool they used, they worked diligently until the church clock's chimes struck a terrifying series, causing young Jerry to flee in fright, his hair standing on end just like his father's.</t2785>
<t2786>However, the long-held desire to understand not only prevented it from running away but also pulled it back.</t2786> <t2787>The three others were still persistently fishing at night when little Jerry peeked through the gate again; but this time, it seemed that a fish had taken the bait.</t2787> <t2788>From the dug hole came creaking and groaning sounds, and the three figures above were straining as if something very heavy was pulling them down.</t2788> <t2789>Bit by bit, that heavy object was pulled up from the surrounding soil and emerged to the surface.</t2789> <t2790>Little Jerry already knew what it was, but when he first saw it with his own eyes, and saw his esteemed father about to pry it out, he was so terrified that he ran away, this time sprinting non-stop for several kilometers.</t2790>
<t2791>At that moment, he ran as fast as he could, only stopping to catch his breath, as if it were a ghostly race and his utmost desire was to reach the finish line.</t2791><t2792>The boy was convinced that the coffin he had just seen was chasing after him; and he imagined that terrifying object standing upright, leaping onto his back, about to catch up and grab him - perhaps it would seize his arm - and he had to run for his life.</t2792><t2793>The ghostly coffin appeared and disappeared, present everywhere, so when the entire darkness behind him turned into a horror, the boy had to dash into the middle of the road to avoid the dark alleys, fearing that ghost would leap out from there like a bloated kite with no wings or tail.</t2793><t2794>The ghost also hid at the doorways, rubbing its ghastly shoulders against the doors, then hunching its shoulders and retracting its neck as if laughing loudly.</t2794><t2795>The ghost hid in the darkness on the road, lying on its back waiting to trip him.</t2795><t2796>And there was always a ghost leaping behind, chasing closely, so that when the boy finally reached his house, he still hadn't recovered from the fright.</t2796><t2797>Even then, the ghost did not let him go but followed him upstairs, thumping on the steps, jumping onto the bed with him, and headbutting his chest, pushing him into a deep, exhausted sleep.</t2797>
<t2798>The sky had just begun to brighten, dawn had not yet broken when little Jerry, lying in the room, woke up from a heavy sleep because of his father's voice in the outer room.</t2798> <t2799>His father must have encountered something unfavorable; at least, little Jerry could deduce that much when he saw Cruncher grabbing his wife's ears and banging her head against the headboard.</t2799>
<t2800>− I told you already, - Cruncher said, - I said I would do it.</t2800>
<t2801>- Jerry, Jerry, Jerry! - The sister-in-law pleaded.</t2801>
<t2802>− When there's a profitable deal, you don't agree, - Jerry said, you keep wishing bad luck upon me and my friends.</t2802> <t2803>I tell you but you don't listen to me, you don't respect me, for what reason? −</t2803> <t2804>I'm just trying to be a good wife, Jerry, - the miserable woman cried as she argued back.</t2804>
<t2805>− You say you want to be a good wife, but you curse your husband to have bad luck in his work? You say you respect your husband, but you sabotage his work? You say you listen to your husband, but why don't you listen to him on important matters? −</t2805> <t2806>When I said that, you weren't doing this terrible job, Jerry.</t2806>
<t2807>− Being a wife who lives a virtuous life is fortunate for you, Cruncher retorted, - but whether the husband works or doesn't work is not something for you women to calculate in your heads.</t2807> <t2808>Being a wife who respects her husband and listens to her husband should let him work in peace.</t2808> <t2809>Do you think you're pious? If you're pious, I'd rather marry an irreligious woman! Your sense of responsibility is no better than a post stuck at the bottom of the Thames out there, it seems I have to hammer it into your head like hammering that post for you to understand.</t2809><t2810>.</t2810>
<t2811>The argument took place quietly and ended with the honest worker kicking off his clay-covered boots from his feet and lying down on the floor.</t2811> <t2812>After a moment of timidly glancing at his father lying on his back, with his rust-stained hands under his head as a pillow, the son also lay down to continue sleeping.</t2812>
<t2813>That morning's breakfast had no fish, and there was nothing else either.</t2813>
<t2814>Cruncher was disheartened and irritable, holding the tin lid as if it were a missile ready to launch at his wife should he see any sign on her face that she was secretly praying.</t2814> <t2815>He brushed his teeth and washed his face at the usual time, then continued with his son to their daytime pretense work.</t2815>
<t2816>Tucking the stool under his arm, walking beside his father on the bustling, sunlit Fleet Street, young Jerry this morning was completely different from the young Jerry who, chased by a ghostly coffin, ran home alone in the dark last night.</t2816> <t2817>The boy's fear had dissipated with the night, and the new day had returned to him his familiar mischievous look - and many people jostling on Fleet Street and in the city of London on that beautiful morning felt the same way as the young boy.</t2817>
<t2818>− Dad, - Jerry said on the way, carefully walking a pace away from his father with a stool in between, - what kind of job is a body snatcher, dad? Cruncher paused for a moment on the sidewalk before answering: − How would I know? −</t2818> <t2819>I thought you knew everything, dad, - the boy said honestly.</t2819>
<t2820>− Huh! Fine! - Cruncher continued walking, speaking as he removed his hat to let his spiky hair free, - it's a business trade.</t2820>
<t2821>− Selling what, Dad? - Jerry quickly asked.</t2821>
<t2822>− Those are goods... - Cruncher pondered for a moment before answering, - ... that belong to the category of scientific* goods.</t2822>
<t2823>− A dead body, right father? - The kid cheerfully asked.</t2823>
<t2824>− I think it's pretty much the same, - Cruncher replied.</t2824>
<t2825>− Oh, father, I want to grow up to be a body snatcher like you! Cruncher felt happy inside, but still shook his head to show a sense of morality and doubt.</t2825>
<t2826>− It depends on how skilled you are.</t2826> <t2827>You must practice to become skilled, and never tell anyone what doesn't need to be said. For now, it's impossible to say whether you can do that job or not.</t2827>
<t2828>Hearing that, little Jerry happily ran a few steps ahead of his father, placing the stool in the shade of the Temple Bar gate. Cruncher followed behind, thinking to himself: "Jerry, an honest man like you might find that this little boy will bring luck, making up for his mother!"</t2828>
<t2829>15.</t2829> <t2830>Knitting</t2830>
<t2831>Mr. Defarge's wine shop had customers drinking wine earlier than usual.</t2831>
<t2832>It's only six in the morning, and the haggard faces standing outside the barred windows looking in already see other faces inside buried in their glasses.</t2832> <t2833>Mr. Defarge sells very bland wine even at the best of times, but now the wine he sells is even blander.</t2833> <t2834>Bland and sour, just looking at the gloomy faces of the drinkers tells you what the wine is like.</t2834> <t2835>The grapes pressed by Monsieur Defarge yield no passionate fervor for the drinkers, only a smoldering warmth hidden in the dregs.</t2835>
<t2836>This is the third consecutive day that Mr. Defarge's tavern has had customers since early morning.</t2836> <t2837>It started on Monday, and now it's already Wednesday.</t2837> <t2838>The visitors came there more to ponder than to drink; since the tavern opened, many people have come to listen, whisper, and linger without spending a single penny at the counter to save their souls.</t2838> <t2839>But in the tavern, they acted as if they were extremely eager, as if they could easily buy all the barrels; and they moved from place to place, from corner to corner, their faces greedily absorbing words instead of wine.</t2839>
<t2840>The guests were more numerous than usual, yet the owner was nowhere to be seen.</t2840> <t2841>No one paid attention to the absence of the owner because those who entered the tavern were not looking for him, did not need to meet him, and no one was surprised to see only Mrs. Defarge sitting at the counter overseeing the sale of liquor; in front of her was a bowl containing chipped coins, the embossed faces on the coins worn down to unrecognizable shapes from countless times of rubbing against tattered pockets.</t2841>
<t2842>If any spy were to look into this tavern - as is their habit of prying everywhere, regardless of the place's status, from the royal palace to the dungeon - they would see an atmosphere of boredom and lethargy enveloping the interior.</t2842>
<t2843>The card games dragged on wearily, the domino players thoughtfully built towers with the pieces, the drinkers dipped their fingers into spilled drops of liquor to doodle on the table, and Madame Defarge herself idly scratched at her sleeve with the tip of a toothpick, her distant expression as if she were hearing and seeing something silent and invisible.</t2843>
<t2844>The Saint Antoine district at the tavern remained the same until noon.</t2844> <t2845>When the sun was at its peak, two dusty travelers passed through the streets, under the hanging lamps; one was Mr. Defarge, the other was a road worker wearing a blue hat.</t2845> <t2846>Dirty and thirsty, the two men stepped into the tavern.</t2846>
<t2847>Their appearance was like lighting a fire right in the heart of Saint Antoine, wherever they went the fire spread, flickering on the faces standing at the entrances and windows.</t2847> <t2848>However, no one followed, no one said anything when the two entered the tavern, although everyone's eyes were on them.</t2848>
<t2849>− Hello everyone! - Mr. Defarge spoke up.</t2849>
<t2850>Perhaps that is a sign for every tongue to start working.</t2850> <t2851>Everyone simultaneously opened their mouths and said, "Hello!".</t2851>
<t2852>− The weather is bad today, folks, - Defarge said, shaking his head.</t2852>
<t2853>Hearing that, everyone looked at each other and then all bowed their heads down and sat in silence.</t2853>
<t2854>Except for one person who stood up and went outside.</t2854>
<t2855>− Hey dear, - Defarge said loudly to Mrs. Defarge, - I traveled a stretch with this respectable road mender named Jacques.</t2855> <t2856>I met him, just by chance, when I was a day and a half out of Paris.</t2856> <t2857>This guy is nice, this road mender named Jacques.</t2857> <t2858>Give him a drink, dear!</t2858> <t2859>Another person stood up and went outside.</t2859> <t2860>Mrs. Defarge placed a glass of wine in front of road mender Jacques, he lifted his green hat to greet everyone and then drank.</t2860> <t2861>In his chest pocket, he had a few pieces of black bread; from time to time he would take a bite and just sit at Mrs. Defarge's counter, drinking wine and nibbling.</t2861> <t2862>Another person stood up and went outside.</t2862>
<t2863>Defarge also quenched his thirst with a freshly poured glass of wine - but his glass was less full than the guest's, even though wine was something he never lacked - and he just stood waiting until the peasant finished his breakfast.</t2863> <t2864>Defarge didn't look at anyone around, and no one looked at him; not even Madame Defarge, who was engrossed in her usual knitting.</t2864>
<t2865>− Finished eating, my friend? - Defarge spoke up after a while.</t2865>
<t2866>− Okay, thank you, sir.</t2866>
<t2867>− Then let's go! You will see the room where you will stay as I mentioned.</t2867>
<t2868>It will surely suit your taste very much.</t2868>
<t2869>From the tavern to the street, from the street to the inner yard, from the yard up the steep stairs, from the stairs to the attic - where once lived the old man with silver hair, hunched over the workbench, diligently making shoes.</t2869>
<t2870>Now, that silver-haired person is no longer there; but the three people present are the ones who had just left the tavern one by one.</t2870> <t2871>And between them and the silver-haired person who has gone far away, there is a small connection: they had once stood outside, secretly watching that person through the cracks in the wall.</t2871>
<t2872>Defarge carefully closed the door and then lowered his voice to say: "Jacques One, Jacques Two, Jacques Three! This is the witness that I, Jacques Four, have arranged to meet."</t2872> <t2873>He will inform you clearly.</t2873> <t2874>Speak, Jacques Five! The road mender, with his green cap in hand, wiped his dark forehead and said nervously:</t2874> <t2875>"Where should I start, sir?"</t2875> <t2876>"Start from the beginning," Defarge's reply was not without reason.</t2876>
<t2877>− So, gentlemen, - the road worker began, - last year around this time in the summer, I saw that person hanging under the Marquis's carriage, clinging to the chain.</t2877> <t2878>This is how it happened.</t2878> <t2879>At that time, I had finished my work and was about to go home, the sun was about to set, the Marquis's carriage was slowly going up the hill, and that person was hanging onto the chain... like this.</t2879>
<t2880>The village porter used gestures to recount old stories, and by now he had mastered this performance, realizing that it was an indispensable and always enjoyable entertainment for the villagers throughout the past year.</t2880>
<t2881>Jacques Một interrupted and asked the road worker if he had ever seen the person under the car before. −</t2881> <t2882>Never, - the road worker said as he straightened up again.</t2882>
<t2883>Jacques Ba asked how the road worker could later identify the man?</t2883> <t2884>By his tall stature, - the road worker replied quietly, picking his nose with one finger.</t2884> <t2885>- When the Marquis asked that evening, "Hey, what did that guy look like?" I answered, "As tall as a ghost!".</t2885>
<t2886>− Should have said "loắt choắt" like a dwarf, - Jacques Hai retorted.</t2886>
<t2887>− But how could I have known at that time!</t2887> <t2888>At that time, the event had not yet occurred, and that person had not confided in me either.</t2888> <t2889>See!</t2889> <t2890>But even in that situation, I did not reveal anything.</t2890> <t2891>The Marquis pointed at me while standing near the fountain in my village and said, "Bring that brat to me for questioning!"</t2891> <t2892>To be honest, gentlemen, I did not reveal anything.</t2892>
<t2893>− "He's right, Jacques," Defarge said softly to the person who had just interrupted.</t2893> <t2894>"Continue! − Alright!" the road worker said with a secretive air.</t2894> <t2895>"That tall man disappeared, and they hunted for... how many months? Nine, ten, eleven months? − The number of months doesn't matter," Defarge said.</t2895> <t2896>"He hid well, but unfortunately, he was eventually exposed. Continue! −"</t2896> <t2897>Then I went back to work on the hillside, and the sun was about to set again.</t2897> <t2898>I was packing up my tools to go down the hill to my home in the village below, it was already dusk, when I looked up and saw six soldiers coming over the hill.</t2898>
<t2899>In the midst of those soldiers was a tall man, his hands tied... tightly tied to his sides... like this!</t2899> <t2900>Using his inseparable hat as a prop, he mimicked the motion of a person with their elbows bound tightly to their waist, the rope knotted securely behind their back.</t2900>
<t2901>− I was standing to one side, gentlemen, next to the pile of rocks, watching some soldiers and prisoners pass by; since this road is deserted, anything happening here is worth watching.</t2901> <t2902>At first, when they arrived, I only saw six soldiers with a tall prisoner who was tied up, almost completely black so I couldn't see his face; except for the side facing the setting sun which was glowing red.</t2902> <t2903>Then I saw their shadows stretch long on the other side of the road, and on the hillside above, like the shadows of giants.</t2903> <t2904>Then I saw them covered in dust, wherever they went, the dust rose up in clouds!</t2904> <t2905>But when they got really close, I recognized the tall man, and he recognized me.</t2905> <t2906>Well, he must have been very eager to throw himself down that hillside and escape again, just like the afternoon when I first saw him, also near that very spot!</t2906> <t2907>The guy described it as if he was there in person, clearly he had seen it vividly; perhaps in his life he rarely encountered such an event.</t2907>
<t2908>− I didn't let the soldiers know that I recognized the tall man; he didn't let the soldiers know that he recognized me either; both sides acted the same way, both sides understood each other, just a glance was enough to understand.</t2908> <t2909>"Go on!" then the commanding soldier pointed down to the village and said, "hurry to your grave!" then urged the prisoner to move faster.</t2909> <t2910>I followed.</t2910> <t2911>His arms were swollen because they were tied too tightly, the large wooden shoes were cumbersome, and he limped.</t2911> <t2912>Because he limped, he was slow, and the soldiers kept prodding him with their guns... like this!</t2912> <t2913>He demonstrated the action of a person being pushed forward by the butt of a musket.</t2913>
<t2914>− Then when the whole group ran down the hill like they were being chased by ghosts, he tripped and fell, and the soldiers laughed loudly as they pulled him up.</t2914> <t2915>His face was bleeding, covered in dirt, but he couldn't raise his hand to wipe it; seeing this, the soldiers laughed even louder.</t2915> <t2916>They took him into the village; the whole village ran out to see; they took him past the mill and then up to the prison; all the villagers saw the prison gate open in the darkness and swallow the prisoner... like this! The man tried to open his mouth as wide as possible and then snapped it shut, making his teeth clack together with a sharp sound.</t2916> <t2917>Seeing that the man didn't want to open his mouth quickly to prolong the suspense, Defarge said: − Continue, Jacques.</t2917>
<t2918>− The whole village returned, - the road worker continued, in a sneaky manner, whispering, - the whole village murmured by the fountain; the whole village went to sleep; the whole village dreamed of that unfortunate man being locked behind bars, padlocks in the prison on the cliff, and never leaving that place unless he died.</t2918> <t2919>In the morning, carrying my tools on my shoulder, quickly eating a few pieces of black bread, I went, I passed by that prison on my way to work.</t2919> <t2920>When I got there, I saw him, way up there, behind the bars of a tall iron cage, still covered in dust and blood as the night before, looking out.</t2920> <t2921>He was still tied up so he couldn't wave; I didn't dare call out; he looked at me as if he were already dead.</t2921>
<t2922>Defarge and the three others looked at each other sorrowfully, their faces dark, restrained, and full of hatred as they listened to the peasant's story; although they did not show it, their demeanor was full of authority.</t2922> <t2923>They looked like ruthless judges; Jacques One and Two sat on the rickety bed, both resting their chins in their hands, eyes intently watching the road worker; Jacques Three knelt on one knee beside them, also watching intently, his restless hand rubbing the sensitive skin around his nose and mouth;</t2923> <t2924>Defarge stood between the three Jacques and the storyteller, while the storyteller blocked the light from the window, constantly looking from Defarge to the three others and then from the three others back to Defarge.</t2924>
<t2925>− Continue, Jacques, - Defarge said.</t2925>
<t2926>− He stayed on that iron cage for several days.</t2926> <t2927>The whole village secretly watched because they were afraid.</t2927> <t2928>But they always stood from afar, looking up at the prison on the cliff; then in the evening, when the day's work was done, everyone gathered at the fountain, all facing and looking up at that prison.</t2928> <t2929>Previously, everyone looked towards the post station; but at that time, they all looked up at the prison.</t2929> <t2930>They whispered to each other by the fountain that even if he was sentenced to death, he wouldn't be executed; they said a petition had been submitted in Paris, stating that he went mad from grief over his child's death; they said the petition had been presented to the King himself.</t2930> <t2931>How would I know about this! It could be true.</t2931> <t2932>Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.</t2932>
<t2933>− Listen here, Jacques, - Number One coldly interrupted.</t2933> <t2934>Indeed, a petition was presented to the King and Queen.</t2934> <t2935>Except for you, everyone here saw the King receive the petition, right in his carriage while traveling through the streets, with the Queen sitting beside him.</t2935> <t2936>It was Defarge, standing right here, who risked his life to dash forward and present that petition.</t2936>
<t2937>− It's not over yet, Jacques! - The voice of Number Three, who was kneeling; his hands constantly rubbing around the sensitive skin area with a greedy look as if he was starving for something that wasn't food or drink.</t2937> <t2938>- The guards, both mounted and on foot, surrounded this petitioner and beat him up.</t2938>
<t2939>Do you understand clearly? −</t2939> <t2940>Yes, we understand clearly, sirs.</t2940>
<t2941>− Then continue, - Defarge said.</t2941>
<t2942>− Then, there's more, - the peasant continued, - they are also whispering that he was taken down to my village to be executed on the spot, he will definitely be executed.</t2942> <t2943>They are also gossiping that he killed a high official, and since the high official is like a parent to the tenants... or serfs... call it whatever you want... he will be executed like someone who killed their parents.</t2943> <t2944>An old man at the fountain said that his right hand, the hand that held the knife, will be burned right in front of him; then both arms will be cut off, both legs will be cut off, his chest will be split open; then boiling oil, molten lead, hot pitch, melted wax with sulfur will be poured into the wounds; finally, he will be quartered by horses.</t2944> <t2945>The old man said that in reality, a prisoner had already undergone this punishment for attempting to assassinate the late king, Louis XV. But whether he was telling the truth or not, I don't know.</t2945> <t2946>I never went to school.</t2946>
<t2947>− Then listen, Jacques! - Said the person with restless hands and a hungry look.</t2947> <t2948>- That prisoner’s name was Damiens, and all those tortures were carried out in broad daylight, right in the streets of Paris; among the dense crowd that came to watch the execution, the most notable were the ladies and the affluent women; they were eager, watching intently until the very end... until the very end, do you hear, Jacques!</t2948> <t2949>That means until midnight, when that prisoner had already had both legs and one arm cut off, and was still breathing! This happened when... oh, how old are you? −</t2949> <t2950>Thirty-five, - said the road worker, who looked as old as sixty.</t2950>
<t2951>− So at that time you were just over ten years old; you could have witnessed this incident.</t2951>
<t2952>− Enough! - Defarge's voice was impatient and fierce. - Long live the devil! Continue.</t2952>
<t2953>− Agreed!</t2953> <t2954>Rumors spread this way and that; everyone was talking about the prisoner; even the fountain seemed to be gossiping about it.</t2954> <t2955>Finally, on a Sunday night when the whole village was asleep; soldiers appeared, a winding procession from the prison down, the clinking of their weapons echoing on the village's stone streets.</t2955> <t2956>Laborers dug the ground, laborers hammered, soldiers laughed and sang; by morning, next to the fountain stood a gallows fifteen meters high, contaminating the entire water source.</t2956>
<t2957>The road laborer looked up at the low ceiling, but his gaze seemed to pierce through the roof, directed at some gallows in the sky.</t2957>
<t2958>− Everything came to a halt; everyone gathered there, no one took the cows out to graze, and the cows stood together with the people in one place.</t2958> <t2959>By noon, the sound of a drum was heard.</t2959> <t2960>The soldiers had entered the prison during the night and now were leading the prisoner out.</t2960> <t2961>He was still tied up as before, with a rag stuffed in his mouth... tightly bound with a taut rope, making him look like he was grinning.</t2961> <t2962>- The man recalled that image by grimacing, pulling his mouth wide with his thumbs to his ears.</t2962> <t2963>- At the top of the gallows, a knife was embedded, its sharp blade pointing skyward.</t2963> <t2964>He was hung up fifteen meters high... and dangled there, contaminating the water tower below.</t2964>
<t2965>They looked at each other, and the countryman used his green hat to wipe his face, which was covered in sweat, as he recounted the scene.</t2965>
<t2966>− It was terrifying, gentlemen.</t2966> <t2967>How could women and children fetch water to use!</t2967> <t2968>Who would dare to chat under that shadow anymore!</t2968> <t2969>The shadow of the gallows, did you hear clearly, gentlemen?</t2969> <t2970>When I left the village, on Monday evening at sunset, and stood on the hill looking back, the shadow of that hanging body fell over the church, over the mill, over the prison... it seemed to stretch across the ground, gentlemen, all the way to the horizon! The hungry Jacques gnawed at his fingers while he watched the other three, his fingertips trembling with ravenous desire.</t2970>
<t2971>− That's it, gentlemen.</t2971> <t2972>I left at sunset, as advised, and kept going all through that night and the following day, until I met this friend, just as I had been told.</t2972> <t2973>I traveled with him, sometimes by carriage, sometimes on foot, until the end of yesterday and all through last night.</t2973> <t2974>Now, I am here!</t2974> <t2975>After a moment of sorrowful silence, Jacques One spoke: − Good! You did the right thing and have recounted it truthfully.</t2975> <t2976>Could you wait outside the door for a moment? −</t2976> <t2977>Gladly, - the road worker said.</t2977> <t2978>Defarge led him to the top of the stairs, left him there, and then returned.</t2978>
<t2979>The three people stood up, huddling together to discuss as Defarge returned to the attic room.</t2979>
<t2980>− What do you think, Jacques? - Number One asked. - Should we put him on the list? −</t2980> <t2981>Put him on the list, and he will be eliminated, - Defarge replied.</t2981>
<t2982>− Great! - Number Three groaned with hunger.</t2982>
<t2983>− That castle and the entire lineage? - Number One asked.</t2983>
<t2984>− That castle and the entire family, - Defarge replied. - Destroy them all.</t2984>
<t2985>− Perfect! - The glutton repeated the moan of pleasure and began to gnaw on another finger.</t2985>
<t2986>Jacques Hai asked Defarge: − Are you sure that keeping this list won't cause any trouble? The list is certainly safe because no one but us can decode it; but can we always ensure that we can decode it...</t2986> <t2987>or, should I say, can she always ensure it? −</t2987> <t2988>Jacques, - Defarge replied, straightening up, - if my wife alone is responsible for remembering this list, she will remember it perfectly... not missing a single word.</t2988> <t2989>She has woven that list into her knitting with special stitches and symbols, she can look at it and see clearly without missing a single name.</t2989> <t2990>Trust Madame Defarge.</t2990> <t2991>It would be easier for a coward to commit suicide than to erase a name or a crime from Madame Defarge's knitted list of elimination.</t2991>
<t2992>There were murmurs of trust and approval, then the hungry Number Three asked: −</t2992> <t2993>Are we going to kick that country bumpkin out?</t2993> <t2994>I hope so.</t2994> <t2995>He's not very smart, isn't that dangerous? −</t2995> <t2996>He doesn't know anything, - Defarge said, - and if he does manage to reveal something, he himself will be hanged too.</t2996> <t2997>Leave him to me; just let him stay with me; I'll take care of him and send him on his own way.</t2997> <t2998>He wants to see this beautiful world... see the King, see the Queen, and see the Court; this Sunday I'll show him all those things.</t2998>
<t2999>− What? - Number Three cried out in hunger, eyes wide open.</t2999> <t3000>- How can someone who desires to see royalty and nobility be trustworthy? −</t3000> <t3001>Jacques, - Defare said, - it is wise to show the cat milk if you want the cat to crave milk.</t3001> <t3002>If you want the dog to hunt for you one day, it is wise to let the dog recognize the prey.</t3002>
<t3003>No one said anything more, and they saw the road worker had fallen asleep at the top of the stairs, so they told him to go to the rickety bed inside the attic room to rest.</t3003> <t3004>There was no need to persuade him; he fell asleep immediately after that.</t3004> <t3005>For a country bumpkin like this road worker, there was no better place in Paris than Defarge's tavern. Except for the inexplicable fear that constantly haunted him regarding Madame Defarge, he found living here both novel and comfortable.</t3005> <t3006>But Madame Defarge sat at the bar all day, appearing to pay no attention to him and clearly determined not to consider him involved in any secret schemes, so cold that every time he saw her, his legs trembled with fear.</t3006> <t3007>For he was certain in his heart that he could never predict what she intended to do; and he was convinced that if Madame Defarge's gaudy head suddenly imagined that he had murdered and skinned someone, she would absolutely believe it to be true to the end.</t3007>
<t3008>Therefore, when Sunday came, the road worker did not like (even though he said otherwise) seeing the mistress go along with the master and him to the Palace of Versailles.</t3008> <t3009>It was quite embarrassing when the mistress kept knitting all the way, on the public carriage; and even more embarrassing when at noon, amidst the crowd, she continued knitting non-stop while everyone was eagerly waiting to see the King and Queen's carriage.</t3009>
<t3010>−</t3010> <t3011>You work so hard, - a man standing next to her said.</t3011>
<t3012>− Yes, - Mrs. Defarge replied - I still have many things to knit.</t3012>
<t3013>− What are you knitting? −</t3013> <t3014>All sorts of things.</t3014>
<t3015>− For example...</t3015>
<t3016>− For example, - Ms. Defarge replied calmly, - a shroud.</t3016>
<t3017>The man quickly moved away, and the road worker raised his green hat to fan himself, feeling extremely suffocated standing next to the lady of the house.</t3017> <t3018>If he needed the King and Queen to rescue him, he was fortunate not to have to wait long; the King with a firm jaw and the beautiful Queen appeared in a golden carriage, accompanied by their luxurious and trusted courtiers, a splendid entourage of joyful ladies and handsome ministers; the men and women adorned in silks, jewels, powdered faces, and painted lips, with their haughty manners and disdainful expressions, allowed the road worker to gaze in awe to the point of shouting Long live the King, long live the Queen, long live everyone and everything! As if he had never known anyone else named Jacques in his life.</t3018> <t3019>After that, he saw many gardens, courtyards, watchtowers, fountains, and green hills, again seeing the King and Queen, again seeing the courtiers, ministers, and ladies, again Long live everyone! To the point where he burst into tears from emotion.</t3019> <t3020>Throughout the approximately three-hour-long admiration, he also encountered many people crying out in emotion, and Defarge always held tightly to his collar as if fearing he would rush at these temporary objects of worship and tear them apart.</t3020>
<t3021>− Hooray! - Defarge, like a superior, patted the guy on the back when it was over.</t3021> <t3022>You did great! The road worker now suddenly realized and worried whether he had done anything wrong in his previous expressions; but no.</t3022>
<t3023>− You are exactly the person we need, - Defarge whispered in his ear, - you make those fools believe they will last forever.</t3023> <t3024>Therefore, the more arrogant they are, the sooner they will perish.</t3024>
<t3025>− There! - The road worker exclaimed, looking thoughtful. - That's right.</t3025>
<t3026>− Those fools don't know anything.</t3026> <t3027>Even though they despise our lives and are ready to sacrifice your life or the lives of hundreds like you rather than give up their horses or dogs, they only know what you reveal to them.</t3027> <t3028>Keep deceiving them like that, for a little longer; it's worth deceiving them as much as possible.</t3028>
<t3029>Mrs. Defarge nodded in agreement and looked disdainfully at the country guest.</t3029> <t3030>She said to him: −</t3030> <t3031>As for you, you can shout and cry all you want, as long as you make a show of it, loudly.</t3031> <t3032>Speak up! Can you do it? −</t3032> <t3033>Honestly, I think I can, ma'am.</t3033> <t3034>For the time being, I can.</t3034>
<t3035>− If you see a pile of dolls and are told you can freely destroy and tear them apart, you would choose the most expensive and gorgeous one.</t3035> <t3036>Admit it! Isn't that right? −</t3036> <t3037>That's truly the case, ma'am.</t3037>
<t3038>− Okay.</t3038> <t3039>And if you see a flock of birds that cannot fly and are told you can pluck their feathers as you wish, you would choose the one with the most beautiful feathers; wouldn't you? −</t3039> <t3040>That's right, ma'am.</t3040>
<t3041>− Today you have seen both the doll and the bird, - Mrs. Defarge gestured towards the position where the court had just passed.</t3041> <t3042>- Now, go home.</t3042>
<t3043>16.</t3043> <t3044>Still knitting</t3044>
<t3045>Madame Defarge and her husband leisurely returned to the heart of Saint Antoine, while a green speck of a hat trudged through the night, cutting through the dust, traversing long miles along the roadside, slowly heading straight towards the Marquis's castle, where he now lay in the grave listening to the rustling leaves.</t3045> <t3046>The stone statues now had the leisure to listen to the sounds of trees and flowing water, to the extent that a few ragged villagers - who wandered into the castle's courtyard and wide-terraced staircase while searching for vegetables to eat and scraps of wood to burn - in their hunger-induced delirium, imagined that the faces of the statues had changed.</t3046> <t3047>There was a rumor circulating in the village - a rumor that clung to life as stubbornly as the villagers themselves - that when the knife struck its target, the faces of the statues shifted from arrogance to anger and pain; and when the culprit's body was hoisted twelve meters above the fountain, the faces changed once more to the savage look of the avenged, and have remained that way ever since.</t3047> <t3048>On the stone face of the statue at the large window of the bedroom where the murder occurred, two small indentations on the statue's nose were clearly visible, which no one had noticed before; occasionally, a few raggedly dressed villagers would separate from the crowd to sneak a peek at the petrified face of the Marquis, their bony fingers hastily pointing out the wrinkles to everyone for a moment, before they all scattered to search for something edible among the moss and foliage like a pack of wild rabbits, though the rabbits were luckier not to be as hungry as the people.</t3048>
<t3049>Castles and thatched huts, stone statues and dangling corpses of the condemned, red bloodstains on marble floors and clear water in village wells - thousands of acres - an entire province of France - the whole of France - submerged under the starry sky, all reduced to a fleeting strip of land.</t3049> <t3050>The entire world is the same, with all its grand and trivial matters hidden beneath the twinkling stars.</t3050> <t3051>Just as only the human intellect can separate light and analyze the spectrum clearly, only extraordinary minds can perceive, within the hazy light enveloping this world, all thoughts and actions, all sins and virtues for which everyone on earth is accountable.</t3051>
<t3052>Mr. and Mrs. Defarge sat in the public carriage, creaking under the starlight, following the familiar route towards the gates of Paris. The carriage had to stop at the checkpoint as usual, and the usual lanterns came out to inspect faces and ask questions.</t3052> <t3053>Mr. Defarge got off the carriage; he knew one or two guards here, along with a policeman.</t3053> <t3054>He was very close with the policeman, and the two embraced warmly.</t3054>
<t3055>After the Defarges got off the carriage for the last time at the boundary of the area named Saint Antoine, the saint once again enveloped them in his dark wings; as they groped their way through the black mud and filth of the alleys, Madame Defarge asked her husband: −</t3055> <t3056>Tell me, what did Jacques the policeman say to you? −</t3056> <t3057>He told me everything, but there is little news tonight.</t3057> <t3058>Another spy has been hired to investigate our area.</t3058> <t3059>There may be more, but according to what he knows, there is only one.</t3059>
<t3060>− Ah, got it! - Mrs. Defarge raised her eyebrows, looking indifferent.</t3060> <t3061>Then we need to put him on the list.</t3061> <t3062>Who is he? −</t3062> <t3063>He is an Englishman.</t3063>
<t3064>− The better.</t3064> <t3065>What name? − Barsad, - Defarge pronounced the name with a French accent. But he listened very carefully so he could go home and write it down accurately.</t3065>
<t3066>− Barsad, - she repeated. - Good. What is the first name? −</t3066> <t3067>John.</t3067>
<t3068>− John Barsad, - she repeated, after muttering to herself.</t3068> <t3069>- Good. And his appearance, do you know it? −</t3069> <t3070>Age, around forty; height, about one meter seventy-five; black hair; tanned skin; overall quite handsome; black eyes, thin, long face, sallow complexion; a hooked nose rather than straight, particularly slightly bent towards the left cheek, giving his face a somewhat sinister look.</t3070>
<t3071>− Unbelievable.</t3071> <t3072>Just like a portrait! - The wife said while laughing.</t3072> <t3073>- Tomorrow, he will be put on the list.</t3073>
<t3074>They entered the tavern that had stopped selling (because it was already midnight), Mrs. Defarge immediately took her seat at the counter, counted the meager amount of money collected during her absence, checked the inventory, reviewed the entries in the ledger, made additional entries herself, interrogated the assistant bartender thoroughly before letting him go to sleep.</t3074> <t3075>After that, she poured all the money out of the bowl onto the table again, wrapped the coins in a handkerchief, tying them into separate bundles for safekeeping overnight.</t3075> <t3076>During that time, Defarge, with a pipe in his mouth, walked back and forth, content and admiringly watching his wife work but never interfering; indeed, in both business and family matters, he had spent his entire life just walking back and forth like that.</t3076>
<t3077>The night was sultry and the tavern reeked because it was closed off and surrounded by a foul-smelling area.</t3077> <t3078>Mr. Defarge's sense of smell was not particularly keen, but the scent of wine in the cask seemed stronger than usual, and so did the barrels of rum, brandy, and anise liqueur.</t3078> <t3079>He waved away that mixture of smells with one last puff of his pipe before setting it down.</t3079>
<t3080>− I'm tired, - the wife said, tying the money, her eyes looking up.</t3080> <t3081>The smell of alcohol is just normal.</t3081>
<t3082>− I'm a bit tired, - the husband admitted.</t3082>
<t3083>− I'm also a bit discouraged, - the sharp-eyed wife was not so focused on the money matters that she didn't notice her husband.</t3083> <t3084>- Oh, you men are something else! −</t3084> <t3085>But dear! - Defarge began.</t3085>
<t3086>− But darling! - The wife said, shaking her head vigorously.</t3086> <t3087>- But darling!</t3087> <t3088>Tonight, I am discouraged, darling! − Yes, indeed, - Defarge said as if his wife had understood his innermost thoughts, - it has been too long.</t3088>
<t3089>− It is indeed long, - the wife repeated, - when has it ever been quick? Revenge and punishment are long-term matters, it has to be that way.</t3089>
<t3090>− Lightning strikes don't take much time, - Defarge said.</t3090>
<t3091>− How long does it take to create a lightning bolt? - The wife calmly asked.</t3091>
<t3092>Defarge looked up thoughtfully, perhaps his wife had a point.</t3092> <t3093>His wife continued: −</t3093> <t3094>An earthquake burying a city doesn't take much time.</t3094> <t3095>Ah right! So how long does it take to create an earthquake, tell me? −</t3095> <t3096>A long time, I suppose, - Defarge said.</t3096>
<t3097>− But once it is ready, it happens and crushes everything in its path.</t3097> <t3098>Meanwhile, it always accumulates, even though no one sees, no one hears.</t3098> <t3099>Just rest assured.</t3099> <t3100>Don't be discouraged.</t3100>
<t3101>The wife tied another string of money, her eyes glaring as if she were strangling an enemy.</t3101>
<t3102>− I already told myself, - the wife spread out her right hand to emphasize her words - revenge, even if it takes a long time, will eventually come.</t3102>
<t3103>I already said, it never turns back, it never stops.</t3103> <t3104>I already said, it always moves forward.</t3104> <t3105>Look around and think about the lives of the many people you know, think about the faces of the many people you know, think about the rage and dissatisfaction that the Jacques brothers express more and more fiercely, every day, every hour.</t3105> <t3106>Will those things last forever? Pfft! You are really funny.</t3106>
<t3107>− Brave wife, - Defarge replied, standing in front of his wife, head slightly bowed, hands clasped behind his back, looking like an obedient student attentively facing his catechism teacher, - I have no doubt about that.</t3107> <t3108>But this has been going on for too long, and it could be... you know, it could be... that we might never see it happen in our lifetime.</t3108>
<t3109>− Oh, really! So what? - The wife asked as she tied another string of money, adding another enemy being strangled.</t3109>
<t3110>− Well! - Defarge shrugged, half lamenting, half regretting.</t3110> <t3111>- Then we won't see the victory, will we?</t3111>
<t3112>− We have no choice, - the wife responded, her hand extended emphatically.</t3112> <t3113>- What we are doing is not in vain at all.</t3113> <t3114>I believe, with all my soul, that we will see victory.</t3114> <t3115>But even if we don't see it, even if I am certain that we won't see it, just give me the neck of a cruel nobleman and I will...</t3115>
<t3116>Speaking of that, she gritted her teeth and clenched a string of money as if she wanted to tear someone apart.</t3116>
<t3117>− There! - Defarge exclaimed, his face slightly red as if he felt accused of cowardice.</t3117> <t3118>- Me too, dear, I will not stop at anything.</t3118>
<t3119>− Correct!</t3119> <t3120>But your weakness is that sometimes you need to see the prey and the opportunity in order to maintain your determination to the end.</t3120> <t3121>You must be resolute without needing to do so.</t3121> <t3122>When the time comes, unleash the tiger and the demon within you; but for now, chain them up and wait for the right moment... do not reveal them... but always be ready.</t3122>
<t3123>The wife emphasized the conclusion of her advice by slamming a string of coins onto the bar counter as if she wanted to smash someone's brains out, then nonchalantly tucked the string of coins under her arm and told her husband it was time to go to bed.</t3123>
<t3124>The next noon, that respectable woman sat in her usual spot in the tavern, diligently knitting wool.</t3124> <t3125>And if she occasionally glanced at the rose placed beside her, the flower did not affect her familiar busy expression.</t3125> <t3126>The tavern had a few scattered customers, some drinking, some not.</t3126> <t3127>It was very hot, and all the curious, daring flies that ventured to explore the sticky small glasses near her fell to the bottom, dead.</t3127> <t3128>Their deaths did not stir the slightest sympathy from the other flies leisurely outside, indifferently watching their kind (as if they were elephants or some distant species), until they met the same fate.</t3128> <t3129>How peculiar those indifferent flies were! - Perhaps those at the court on that bright summer day were just as calmly indifferent.</t3129>
<t3130>A person stepped over the threshold, casting a shadow on Madame Defarge's wine shop counter, and she immediately knew it was a stranger.</t3130> <t3131>Putting down her knitting, she pinned a rose to her headscarf and looked at the newcomer.</t3131>
<t3132>Strangely. Just as Madame Defarge picked up the flower, the guests inside immediately stopped chatting and began to leave the tavern one by one.</t3132>
<t3133>− Hello ma'am, - the stranger spoke.</t3133>
<t3134>Hello, sir.</t3134>
<t3135>She spoke loudly, then continued knitting while muttering to herself: "Ah! Hello, around forty years old, about one meter seventy-five tall, black hair, generally quite handsome face, tan skin, black eyes, thin and long face, sallow skin, hooked nose rather than straight, especially slightly crooked towards the left cheek, making the face look somewhat sinister!"</t3135> <t3136>Hello, everyone!" −</t3136> <t3137>Please give me a small glass of aged cognac, and a glass of cool water, madam.</t3137>
<t3138>She politely serves the guests.</t3138>
<t3139>− This cognac is wonderful, madam!</t3139> <t3140>It was the first time someone had praised it like that, and Mrs. Defarge, knowing the origin of the liquor, did not believe it.</t3140> <t3141>Nevertheless, she thanked him for the compliment and continued knitting.</t3141> <t3142>The guest watched the nimble fingers of the innkeeper for a while, then took the opportunity to look around.</t3142>
<t3143>− You knit very well.</t3143>
<t3144>− I'm used to it.</t3144>
<t3145>− The patterns are also beautiful! −</t3145> <t3146>You think so? - She smiled at the customer.</t3146>
<t3147>− Certainly.</t3147> <t3148>May I ask what you're knitting for? −</t3148> <t3149>Just for fun, - she said, her eyes still watching, her mouth still smiling, her fingers still moving swiftly.</t3149>
<t3150>− So, it's not for anything? −</t3150> <t3151>It depends.</t3151> <t3152>Who knows, one day it might be needed.</t3152> <t3153>If it is needed...</t3153> <t3154>Well, - she took a breath and shook her head, as if both coquettish and serious, - then I'll use it!</t3154> <t3155>The notable thing is that the preferences of the people in the Saint Antoine district seem to clearly conflict with the rose on Madame Defarge's headscarf.</t3155>
<t3156>Two people had successively entered the bar, intending to order drinks, but when they saw that decoration, they hesitated, pretended to look around as if searching for a friend who wasn't there, and then left.</t3156> <t3157>The people who were present in the bar when this strange guest entered had also all left, leaving no one behind.</t3157>
<t3158>Disappeared without a trace.</t3158> <t3159>The spy had observed carefully but saw no signs.</t3159> <t3160>Everyone was listlessly wandering in the same manner, hungry, aimless, indifferent, completely natural and beyond suspicion.</t3160>
<t3161>“John,” the shop owner thought to herself, her fingers weaving this name into the list, then looking at the stranger. “Stay a little longer and I will have time to weave in your last name Barsad as well.” −</t3161> <t3162>Do you have a husband? − Yes.</t3162>
<t3163>− Children? − No children.</t3163>
<t3164>− Business seems tough? −</t3164> <t3165>Business is very tough; the people are too poor.</t3165>
<t3166>− Oh, the miserable, unfortunate people!</t3166> <t3167>And still so oppressed...</t3167>
<t3168>as she said.</t3168>
<t3169>− You said it yourself, - she retorted, corrected, and swiftly added some symbol that was anything but flattering to this name.</t3169>
<t3170>− Excuse me, it was indeed I who spoke, not you, but of course you think so too.</t3170> <t3171>Of course.</t3171>
<t3172>− Me, think? - She replied in a high-pitched voice.</t3172> <t3173>- My husband and I are already too busy running this pub.</t3173> <t3174>There's no time to think about anything else.</t3174> <t3175>Here, we only think about how to survive.</t3175> <t3176>That's what we think about, and it's enough to keep us busy from morning till night, leaving no room to think about anything else.</t3176> <t3177>Me, think about something else?</t3177> <t3178>No way.</t3178>
<t3179>Coming here to gather any bits of information he could get, the spy did not allow his confusion to show on his sinister face but stood there pretending to chat casually, his elbows resting on Madame Defarge's wine counter, occasionally sipping a bit of cognac.</t3179>
<t3180>− Truly dreadful, madam, the execution of Gaspard.</t3180> <t3181>Oh! Poor Gaspard! - A very sympathetic sigh.</t3181>
<t3182>− Really? - The shop owner said nonchalantly. - Anyone who uses a knife for such things must pay the price.</t3182> <t3183>He already knew the price of that luxury and has paid it.</t3183>
<t3184>− I heard that... - the spy lowered his voice to a whisper as if to suggest a secret, every muscle on his fierce face bearing the suspicious look of a wounded revolutionary - I heard that the people here are very sympathetic and angry about that poor person.</t3184> <t3185>Just telling you, ma'am.</t3185>
<t3186>− Is that so? - the shop owner asked absentmindedly.</t3186>
<t3187>− Isn't that so? − ...</t3187> <t3188>My house is here! - Mrs. Defarge said.</t3188>
<t3189>The shop owner had just passed through the door when the spy lifted his hat in greeting and said with a deliberate smile, "Hello, Jacques!" Defarge stood still, glaring at him.</t3189>
<t3190>− Hello, Jacques! - He repeated, no longer entirely confident, and his smile turned awkward under that intense stare.</t3190>
<t3191>− You are mistaken, sir, - the innkeeper replied. - You are mistaking me for someone else.</t3191> <t3192>That is not my name.</t3192> <t3193>My name is Ernest Defarge.</t3193>
<t3194>− It's all the same, - the spy said cheerfully, but also awkwardly.</t3194> <t3195>- Hello! − Hello! - Defarge replied coldly.</t3195>
<t3196>− I just told you, I had the honor of conversing with your wife when you came in, about what people are saying, that the people of Saint Antoine are very sympathetic and angry... and rightly so!...</t3196> <t3197>About the unfortunate fate of poor Gaspard.</t3197>
<t3198>− I haven't heard anyone say that, - Defarge shook his head. - I don't know anything about this.</t3198>
<t3199>After speaking, he walked around to the back of the bar, stood with his hand resting on the back of his wife's chair, and looked at the person sitting on the other side of the barrier facing both him and his wife, the person whom both he and his wife would gleefully shoot dead if given the chance.</t3199>
<t3200>Accustomed to the job, the detective pretended not to know, kept drinking the small glass of cognac, sipped some cool water, and then ordered another glass of cognac.</t3200>
<t3201>Madame Defarge poured wine for him, then picked up her knitting and continued, knitting while softly humming a song.</t3201>
<t3202>− It seems you know this area well; that is, even better than I do? - Defarge said.</t3202>
<t3203>− Not at all, but I want to know more.</t3203> <t3204>I am wholeheartedly concerned about the miserable residents here.</t3204>
<t3205>− Hmph! - Defarge muttered.</t3205>
<t3206>− Thanks to the honor of speaking with you, Mr. Defarge, I remembered this matter, - the spy kept talking - the matter is that I also had the honor of knowing some interesting things related to you.</t3206>
<t3207>− Really? - Defarge said even more indifferently.</t3207>
<t3208>− Yes, it's true.</t3208> <t3209>When Doctor Manette was released from prison, it was he, his former servant, who took care of him, I know this.</t3209> <t3210>The doctor was entrusted to him.</t3210> <t3211>I know the story well, you see? −</t3211> <t3212>That's right, - said Defarge.</t3212> <t3213>While knitting and humming, his wife casually nudged him with her elbow, implying that he should respond, but as briefly as possible.</t3213>
<t3214>− It was you whom the doctor's daughter came to find, - the spy said, - and she took her father away from your place, accompanied by a gentleman in a fine brown coat; what was his name again?... wearing a small wig...</t3214> <t3215>Lorry...</t3215>
<t3216>people from Tellson's Bank and the Association... went to England.</t3216>
<t3217>− That's right, - Defarge repeated.</t3217>
<t3218>− Very fond memories! - The spy said.</t3218> <t3219>- I know Dr. Manette and his daughter in England.</t3219>
<t3220>− Really? - Defarge said.</t3220>
<t3221>− Have you heard any news about them lately? −</t3221> <t3222>No.</t3222>
<t3223>− Actually, - Mrs. Defarge stopped knitting, stopped singing, looked up and interjected, - we haven't heard anything about them anymore.</t3223> <t3224>We did get news that they arrived safely, and received one or two letters; but since then, we've gone our separate ways...</t3224> <t3225>they and us... we no longer have any contact.</t3225>
<t3226>− Yes, ma'am, - the spy replied.</t3226> <t3227>- That girl is about to get married.</t3227>
<t3228>− Getting married soon? - The shop owner said.</t3228> <t3229>- A pretty girl like her should have been married long ago.</t3229> <t3230>You English people seem quite cold.</t3230>
<t3231>− Oh! You know I'm English.</t3231>
<t3232>− From the voice, I can tell, - the shop owner replied, - and I think the voice reflects the person.</t3232>
<t3233>That guy did not take this recognition as a compliment; but he skillfully managed with a fake laugh.</t3233> <t3234>After finishing his glass of cognac, he continued: −</t3234> <t3235>Yes, Miss Manette is about to get married.</t3235> <t3236>But she is not marrying an Englishman; she is marrying someone like her, of French origin. Speaking of Gaspard; (Oh dear, poor Gaspard! So cruel, so cruel!) the strange thing is that she is about to marry the nephew of the Marquis, the very man for whom Gaspard was hanged high up; in other words; Miss Manette's fiancé is the current Marquis.</t3236>
<t3237>But he lives in hiding in England, where he is not a Marquis at all; he is Charles Darnay.</t3237> <t3238>He goes by the name D’Aulnais from his mother's side.</t3238>
<t3239>Mrs. Defarge continued knitting as usual, but this news had an obvious impact on her husband.</t3239> <t3240>Behind the bar, Defarge struck a match and lit his pipe, his trembling hands revealing his agitation.</t3240>
<t3241>That spy wouldn't be worthy of being called a spy if he didn't notice or pay attention to those signs.</t3241>
<t3242>At least he won a point, though its value was uncertain, and with no more customers entering the shop for him to gather more information, Barsad paid for his drink and left; on his way out, he courteously expressed his desire to have the honor of meeting Mr. and Mrs. Defarge again.</t3242> <t3243>He had been outside Saint Antoine for a few minutes, yet the couple remained in their positions, fearing he might return.</t3243>
<t3244>− Is it true? - Defarge asked in a low voice, his eyes looking down at his wife while he stood smoking, one hand resting on the back of her chair.</t3244>
<t3245>− Is what he said about Miss Manette true? −</t3245> <t3246>That's what he said, - the wife replied; her eyebrows slightly raised, - it might not be true.</t3246> <t3247>But it might be true.</t3247>
<t3248>− If...</t3248> <t3249>- Defarge had just started speaking when he fell silent.</t3249>
<t3250>− If what? - The wife asked.</t3250>
<t3251>− ...</t3251> <t3252>If it happens, when we are still alive to see the victory... I hope that, for her sake, fate will keep her husband away from France.</t3252>
<t3253>− Her husband's fate, - said Madame Defarge with her usual indifferent tone, - will lead him to where he must go, to the end he must meet.</t3253> <t3254>That is all I know.</t3254>
<t3255>− But it's so strange... oh, but how could it not be strange...</t3255> <t3256>- Defarge almost pleaded with his wife to admit, - think about it, after all the affection we've given to the doctor, to his daughter, now under your knitting needles, her husband's name is next to the name of that scoundrel who just left? −</t3256> <t3257>When it happens, there will be even stranger things, - his wife replied.</t3257>
<t3258>− I have saved both names to the list, it's all done; both deserve it; that is enough.</t3258>
<t3259>She had gathered up her knitting when she said those words, then removed the rose from her headscarf.</t3259> <t3260>Either the people of Saint Antoine intuitively knew that the offensive ornament had disappeared, or they had been waiting for the moment the rose was taken down; in any case, the people of this area soon after shuffled back, restoring the old vitality to the tavern.</t3260>
<t3261>In the afternoon, during this season, it was the time when people in Saint Antoine would show their faces on the streets, sit on their doorsteps or window sills, gather at street corners or in dirty courtyards to catch the breeze, and Madame Defarge, with her knitting in hand, was accustomed to moving from place to place, meeting one group after another - she was like a missionary (there were many like her); the kind of person whose absence would make the world a better place.</t3261> <t3262>All the women knitted.</t3262> <t3263>They knitted useless things; but this craft was a mechanical substitute for eating; the hands worked in place of the mouth and digestive organs - if those bony fingers were to remain still, the stomachs would growl more from hunger.</t3263>
<t3264>Like nimble fingers; the eyes were also nimble, and the thoughts were nimble as well.</t3264> <t3265>As Madame Defarge moved from one group to another, all three of these things worked faster and more fiercely in each group of women she had spoken to and then left.</t3265>
<t3266>The husband stood smoking at the doorway, looking at his wife with admiration.</t3266>
<t3267>“How rare are skillful women,” he thought to himself, “a strong, exceptional woman, incredibly talented!” Darkness gradually fell, then the church bells chimed and from afar echoed the rhythm of the Royal Guard's drums as the women sat knitting, still knitting.</t3267> <t3268>Darkness enveloped them.</t3268> <t3269>Another night was surely approaching when the cheerful church bells now ringing from high towers across France would be melted down to cast formidable cannons; when the drumbeats that usually drowned out the cries of the wretched would roar in that night with the screams of Power and Plenty, of Freedom and Life.</t3269> <t3270>Layer upon layer of darkness covered the women who sat knitting, still knitting, their hearts harboring dreams of seeing themselves gathered around a high platform yet to be erected, where they sat knitting, knitting, counting, counting each head as it fell.</t3270>
<t3271>17.</t3271> <t3272>That night</t3272>
<t3273>Never had the sun set so gloriously on the quiet corner of Soho as it did that memorable evening when the doctor and his daughter sat together under the elm tree.</t3273> <t3274>Never had the moon risen so gently over the vast city of London as it did that night when the father and daughter were still sitting there, and the moonlight filtered through the leaves, illuminating their faces.</t3274>
<t3275>Lucie will get married tomorrow.</t3275> <t3276>She has spent this last evening with her father, and it is just the two of them under the tree.</t3276>
<t3277>− Are you happy, dear father? −</t3277> <t3278>Of course, my little girl.</t3278>
<t3279>The father and daughter sat for a long time but spoke little.</t3279> <t3280>There was still enough light to work and read, but she was not as busy as usual and did not read to her father.</t3280> <t3281>Usually, when she was with her father under this tree, she would work or read, but this time was completely different; nothing could change today.</t3281>
<t3282>− And I am also very happy tonight, Father.</t3282> <t3283>I am immensely happy in the love that God has blessed us with; the love I have for Charles and the love Charles has for me.</t3283> <t3284>But if my life no longer allows me to worship you, or if this marriage is arranged to separate us, even if only by a few blocks, then I would now be indescribably sad and regretful.</t3284> <t3285>Even though...</t3285>
<t3286>No matter how she tried, Lucie would always choke up and leave the sentence unfinished.</t3286>
<t3287>Under the sorrowful moonlight, she wrapped her arms around Mr. Manette's neck and rested her head on her father's chest.</t3287> <t3288>The moonlight was always sorrowful, sorrowful like the sunlight - brilliant and then extinguished - like the fleeting fate of human beings.</t3288>
<t3289>− Dear father! Can you tell me one last time, are you really completely sure that no new feelings or new responsibilities of mine could ever separate the father-daughter bond?</t3289> <t3290>I am certain of that, but what about you? Deep down, do you completely believe that?</t3290> <t3291>The father responded with a cheerful and unmistakably genuine voice: −</t3291> <t3292>Absolutely certain, my dear! Even more so, Lucie, - he added while tenderly kissing his daughter, - seeing you get married makes my future even brighter... oh, even more than if there were no marriage at all.</t3292>
<t3293>− I only hope it's truly like that, Father! −</t3293> <t3294>Believe me, my dear! It truly is.</t3294> <t3295>Just think about it; it's clear and natural, isn't it?</t3295> <t3296>You are dear to me and still young, you can't fully understand my long-standing worry of not wanting your life to be wasted...</t3296>
<t3297>Lucie raised her hand to her father's lips to stop him from speaking, but the doctor took his daughter's hand and repeated.</t3297>
<t3298>− ...</t3298> <t3299>Wasteful, my child... it must not be wasteful, it must not go against the natural order... just because of me.</t3299> <t3300>You are not selfish, so you cannot fully understand how much I have worried about this; but you should ask yourself; how can my happiness be complete if you are at a disadvantage?</t3300> <t3301>If I had never met Charles, father, I would be completely happy without him.</t3301>
<t3302>The father smiled at his daughter's unintended confession, surely Lucie would be very sad without that young man in her life.</t3302> <t3303>He replied: − My dear, you have met Charles, and you have had Charles.</t3303> <t3304>If you hadn't met Charles, you would have met another young man.</t3304> <t3305>And if you didn't meet anyone else, then it would be my fault, and thus the dark part of my life would not only cause me pain but also bring suffering to you.</t3305>
<t3306>Except for the previous court appearance, today is the first time the girl heard her father mention that painful time.</t3306> <t3307>Her father's words echoed in her ears, causing her to feel an unusual emotion, and that feeling would remain deeply imprinted in her heart forever.</t3307>
<t3308>− Look! - The doctor in Beauvais pointed to the moon.</t3308> <t3309>- I have looked at the moon from the prison window, when I couldn't bear its light.</t3309> <t3310>I have looked at the moon with a heart aching, thinking about how that same moonlight was shining on what I had lost, hurting so much that I banged my head against the prison wall.</t3310> <t3311>I have looked at the moon in utter despair, so despondent that I thought of nothing else but how many lines I would need to cross and slash to obliterate the whole round moon.</t3311> <t3312>- He looked at the moon and added, with a contemplative air. - It took twenty lines, both horizontal and vertical, I still remember, and it was very difficult to fit in the twentieth line.</t3312>
<t3313>The strange feeling when hearing her father recall the old days surged within Lucie as the doctor spoke; but he spoke without any intention of causing his daughter sorrow.</t3313> <t3314>It seemed that he merely wanted to compare the current happiness and joy with the extreme hardship of the past.</t3314>
<t3315>− I have looked at the moon, countless times thinking about the unborn child from whom I was separated.</t3315> <t3316>I don't know if it is still alive.</t3316> <t3317>I don't know if it was born healthy or if the mother's suffering took the life of the fetus.</t3317> <t3318>I don't know if it is a boy who might one day avenge me.</t3318> <t3319>Many times in prison, I have longed for revenge unbearably.</t3319>
<t3320>Not sure if it is the boy who is completely unaware of his father's story, or the one who even thinks that disappearing from his life was his father's voluntary wish.</t3320> <t3321>Not sure if it is the girl who will later become a woman.</t3321>
<t3322>Lucie nestled close to her father, then kissed Dr. Manette's cheeks and hands.</t3322>
<t3323>− I once imagined that the girl had completely forgotten her father... or rather, knew nothing about me, didn't care about me.</t3323> <t3324>Year after year, I counted my daughter's age.</t3324> <t3325>I imagined my daughter had married someone who knew nothing about my fate.</t3325> <t3326>And I faded away in the memories of the living, until the next generation no longer remembered me.</t3326>
<t3327>− Dad! Even though I heard you say it was just imagination, I still feel heartbroken as if I were the daughter in your imagination! −</t3327> <t3328>My daughter, Lucie? If it weren't for you comforting and restoring my mind, there wouldn't be this last night to remember old memories and for us to talk under the moon...</t3328> <t3329>Where was I just now? −</t3329> <t3330>The daughter in that imagination knows nothing about her father, doesn't care about him.</t3330>
<t3331>− Ah! But there are many other moonlit nights, when sorrow and silence evoke a different mood... a mood of serene melancholy as if all the pain has reached its limit... I see my daughter coming to the prison to visit her father, taking him out of captivity back to freedom.</t3331> <t3332>Under the moonlight, I often see the face of that daughter clearly, as clearly as I see you now; the only thing is that I can never hold her in my arms; that daughter just stands between the small barred window and the main door.</t3332> <t3333>But you must understand that you are not the daughter I am talking about, right? −</t3333> <t3334>That image... that illusion... isn't it just imagination? − No.</t3334> <t3335>This is different.</t3335> <t3336>It stands before my bewildered eyes, but it never fades away.</t3336> <t3337>The image in my imagination is of a different daughter and more real.</t3337> <t3338>I know nothing about her appearance except that she resembles her mother.</t3338> <t3339>And the illusion in front of me also has that resemblance... like you... but it is not her.</t3339> <t3340>Do you understand what I mean, Lucie? Probably not?</t3340> <t3341>I fear that you would have to live in solitary confinement to understand these indescribable differences.</t3341>
<t3342>Mr. Manette's calm and composed demeanor could not prevent Lucie from feeling a chill as her father tried to analyze his past emotions.</t3342>
<t3343>− In quieter moments, I see under the moonlight, that girl comes and takes me outside, visiting her family home, a place filled with loving memories of her late father.</t3343> <t3344>In her room, there is a picture of me hanging, and in her prayers, she always mentions my name.</t3344> <t3345>Her life is full of energy, joy, and usefulness; but interspersed in that life is still the sorrowful story of mine.</t3345>
<t3346>− That girl is me, father, even though I am not half as good as she is, I still love you just as much.</t3346>
<t3347>− Then she let me meet her children, - said the doctor from Beauvais, - and they all knew about me, they were all taught to feel compassion for me.</t3347> <t3348>When they passed by the national prison, they moved away from the threatening walls, looked up at the high barred windows, and whispered.</t3348> <t3349>That girl could never set me free; I saw her always bringing me back to the dungeon after showing me such things.</t3349> <t3350>But in those moments, I shed tears of joy, I knelt down to bless her.</t3350>
<t3351>− I am that girl, I wish to be so, father.</t3351> <t3352>Oh father, oh father, will you bless me so fervently tomorrow? −</t3352> <t3353>Lucie, the reason I recount the painful old times is because tonight I love you immensely, and I thank God for granting me this happiness.</t3353>
<t3354>No matter how wild my imaginations were back then, they could never bring me the happiness like the days we spent together, father and son, and what is yet to come.</t3354>
<t3355>Mr. Manette embraced his daughter, prayed for God's blessing on Lucie, and thanked God for giving him a beloved child.</t3355> <t3356>Then the father and daughter went into the house.</t3356>
<t3357>The only person invited to the wedding was Mr. Lorry; there wasn't even a bridesmaid, only the haggard Miss Pross.</t3357> <t3358>This wedding did not change the residence; the house simply had more people, as Charles and Lucie would move up to the rooms on the upper floor, which previously belonged to unseen, ephemeral lodgers, and the newlyweds desired nothing more than that.</t3358>
<t3359>Dr. Manette was very cheerful during dinner.</t3359> <t3360>The dinner table had only three people, with Miss Pross being the third.</t3360> <t3361>He regretted that Charles was not there, inwardly opposing the trivial emotional scheme that had caused his son-in-law's absence, and he raised his glass in silent sympathy for Charles.</t3361>
<t3362>So it was time to retreat to the room and bid farewell to her father.</t3362> <t3363>But in the stillness of the night at three o'clock in the morning, Lucie went downstairs again, secretly entering her father's room, her heart still uneasy due to vague fears from before.</t3363>
<t3364>But everything remained in place; all around was calm; and the father was sleeping soundly, his silver hair spread like a painting on the soft pillow, and his hands lay still under the blanket.</t3364> <t3365>She placed the cumbersome candle into the distant shadow, tiptoed to her father's bed, kissed his lips, and then kept looking down for a long time.</t3365>
<t3366>On that beautiful face, the bitterness of the days of captivity had faded, but the doctor had concealed all traces of the past with a determination so strong that even in his sleep he did not allow it to be revealed.</t3366>
<t3367>That night, throughout the vast and boundless realm, it was impossible to find a face more peaceful, more determined, and more silently resistant in the struggle against the invisible attacker.</t3367>
<t3368>Lucie timidly placed her hand on his chest and prayed for the strength to be as filial as the suffering her father had endured.</t3368> <t3369>Then she withdrew her hand, kissed her father's lips once more, and left the room.</t3369> <t3370>Thus, dawn arrived, and the shadows of the willow leaves danced on his face, gently like Lucie's lips whispering a prayer.</t3370>
<t3371>18.</t3371> <t3372>Nine days</t3372>
<t3373>The sun shone brightly on the wedding day, and three people were ready in front of the closed door of the doctor's room, where Mr. Manette was talking with Charles Darnay inside.</t3373> <t3374>They were preparing to go to the church: the beautiful bride, Mr. Lorry, and Miss Pross - for her, this marriage must have been a great joy if she hadn't held onto the thought that her brother Solomon should have been the groom, but gradually she had to accept this inevitable fact.</t3374>
<t3375>− That's how it is! - Mr. Lorry couldn't get enough of admiring the bride, bustling around her, examining every detail of her beautiful, simple wedding dress. - That's how it is!</t3375> <t3376>I carried you across the sea to be here today, dear Lucie, ever since you were just a baby.</t3376> <t3377>God bless me! At that time, I didn't think about anything! I had no idea that one day I would have the important duty of entrusting you to Charles! −</t3377> <t3378>This marriage wasn't your idea, - Miss Pross said honestly, - so how could you have known back then?</t3378> <t3379>Nonsense! − Really?</t3379> <t3380>Ah; but don't cry, will you? - Mr. Lorry said kindly.</t3380>
<t3381>− I am not crying, - Miss Pross replied.</t3381> <t3382>- You are the one crying.</t3382>
<t3383>− Me, Miss Pross? - By now, Mr. Lorry dared to tease her whenever he had the chance.</t3383>
<t3384>− Who else could it be; I saw it with my own eyes, and I am not mistaken.</t3384> <t3385>Your silver dish set is a gift that would bring tears to anyone's eyes, - said Miss Pross.</t3385> <t3386>When the gift box arrived last night, every single fork and spoon made me cry my eyes out.</t3386>
<t3387>− So I am very pleased, - Mr. Lorry said, - although I swear on my honor, I never intended to make anyone cry their eyes out because of those small gifts.</t3387> <t3388>My God! This is a time for a man to reflect on all that he has lost.</t3388> <t3389>Heavens, heavens, heavens! Just think, in nearly fifty years there should have been a Mrs. Lorry by now! −</t3389> <t3390>Not at all! - Miss Pross's voice.</t3390>
<t3391>− Do you think your department will never have a Mrs. Lorry?</t3391> <t3392>Mr. Lorry asked.</t3392>
<t3393>− Hush! - Miss Pross argued.</t3393> <t3394>- You've been single since you were in the cradle.</t3394>
<t3395>− Ah! - Mr. Lorry cheerfully said while adjusting his small wig, it's quite possible.</t3395>
<t3396>− And fate had destined him to be single for life even before he was born, - Miss Pross insisted.</t3396>
<t3397>− Well then, - Mr. Lorry said, - I guess I'm out of luck, I should have had a say in choosing my own lifestyle. That's enough!</t3397> <t3398>Now, my dear Lucie, - the old man gently wrapped his arm around the girl's waist, - I hear them moving about in the next room, so both Miss Pross and I, as the two people officially in charge, want to take this last opportunity to tell you a few things you might want to know.</t3398> <t3399>My dear, you have entrusted your compassionate father to decent and loving people just like yourself; we will take good care of him in every way for the next fortnight while you and your husband go to Warwickshire and around there, even putting aside, or nearly so, the work at Tellson's Bank to look after your father.</t3399> <t3400>Then after the fortnight, your father will go with you and your husband to Wales for another fortnight, and you will see that we will return your father to you in the healthiest and happiest state.</t3400>
<t3401>There, I hear the footsteps of The Person coming to the door.</t3401> <t3402>Let me kiss you, my dear, and give you the blessing of this old-fashioned bachelor before The Person comes to take you.</t3402>
<t3403>He held Lucie's beautiful face in his hands for a long time, observing the expressions on her forehead that he remembered forever. Then, with affection and gentleness, he pressed her golden hair against his small brown wig. This sincere gesture, though old-fashioned, has been a way to express love since the dawn of humanity.</t3403>
<t3404>The doctor's office door was wide open, he and Charles Darnay walked out.</t3404> <t3405>The doctor's face was as pale as if there was no blood left - when the two went into the room, his complexion was not like that.</t3405> <t3406>But his calm demeanor did not change, only Mr. Lorry's sharp eyes noticed a sign of gloom as if a cold wind had just blown through, making the doctor appear somewhat fearful and evasive like before.</t3406>
<t3407>Mr. Manette offered his arm for his daughter to hold and then led her downstairs to the carriage that Mr. Lorry had hired for this special day.</t3407> <t3408>The others followed in another carriage, and soon after, at a nearby church where no strangers were peeking, Charles Darnay and Lucie Manette were happily married.</t3408>
<t3409>Outside, tears glistened in the eyes of many as smiles shone brightly when the wedding ceremony concluded. On the bride's hand was the radiant, sparkling light of several diamonds that had just emerged from the dark pocket of Mr. Lorry. They went home for breakfast, and everything went well. Then came the moment when the golden hair that once mingled with the silver strands of the poor shoemaker in the attic in Paris now once again mingled with the gray hair at the doorstep as they said their goodbyes.</t3409>
<t3410>It was a difficult farewell even though the separation would not be long.</t3410> <t3411>But the father encouraged his daughter and finally gently separated from her tight embrace, he exclaimed: −</t3411> <t3412>Charles, take Lucie away! Lucie is your wife now!</t3412> <t3413>And the daughter's anxious hand waved goodbye to everyone through the carriage window, and then she departed.</t3413>
<t3414>In the secluded street corner frequented by curious idlers, the preparation for this wedding was very simple and neat, leaving only the doctor, Mr. Lorry, and Miss Pross on the road.</t3414> <t3415>It wasn't until the three of them returned to the shadow of the old, cold hall that Mr. Lorry noticed Mr. Manette's face had changed dramatically, as if the golden arm symbol mounted high on the wall had just dealt the doctor a vicious blow.</t3415>
<t3416>The doctor, of course, had to suppress his emotions a lot, and if sudden changes were revealed when given the chance to let loose, it wouldn't be surprising.</t3416> <t3417>But Mr. Lorry became worried because Mr. Manette again bore the distraught expression of his previous suffering; when they went upstairs, the way the doctor absentmindedly ruffled his hair and entered his room like a lost soul reminded Mr. Lorry of the innkeeper Defarge and the journey under the starlight.</t3417>
<t3418>− Probably... - after a moment of anxious thought, he whispered to Miss Pross.</t3418>
<t3419>- Perhaps right now it's best if we don't say anything to the doctor or bother him.</t3419> <t3420>I have to stop by Tellson to check on some work; I'll go right away and be back soon.</t3420> <t3421>At that time, we will take a carriage to take the doctor on a countryside trip and have a meal there, then everything will be fine.</t3421>
<t3422>Mr. Lorry found it easier to visit Tellson's than to leave it.</t3422> <t3423>He was held up there for two whole hours.</t3423> <t3424>When he returned, he went up the old staircase alone, without asking any servants, and went straight to the doctor's room.</t3424> <t3425>The faint sound of a knock made him stop in his tracks.</t3425>
<t3426>− My Lord! - He was startled.</t3426> <t3427>- What's the matter? −</t3427> <t3428>Oh heavens, oh heavens!</t3428> <t3429>It's all ruined! - Miss Pross, her face horrified, wringing her hands, whispered into his ear. - How will we explain this to our dear mistress?</t3429> <t3430>He didn't recognize me, and just kept making shoes!</t3430> <t3431>Mr. Lorry said a few comforting words to her and then went straight into the doctor's room.</t3431> <t3432>The old bench was still facing the source of light as he had seen before, and the shoemaker was diligently, busily working.</t3432>
<t3433>− Doctor Manette.</t3433> <t3434>Friend, Doctor Manette!</t3434> <t3435>The doctor looked at him for a moment - half questioning, half angry at being disturbed - then bent down to continue his work.</t3435>
<t3436>Mr. Manette had taken off his coat and waistcoat; his shirt was open at the collar just like in the old days; and even the gaunt, weary look of those times had returned.</t3436> <t3437>He worked diligently - seemingly anxious - as if the work had been delayed for a long time.</t3437>
<t3438>Mr. Lorry glanced at the shoe in the doctor's hand and recognized it as the one that had been left unfinished some time ago.</t3438> <t3439>He picked up the other one lying next to Mr. Manette and asked about the type of shoe.</t3439>
<t3440>− The lady's walking shoes, - the doctor mumbled, not looking up.</t3440>
<t3441>- It should have been done a long time ago.</t3441> <t3442>Leave it alone.</t3442>
<t3443>− Oh, Dr. Manette.</t3443> <t3444>Look at me! The doctor complied in a mechanical, submissive manner as before, his hands still not stopping their work.</t3444>
<t3445>− Do you know me, my friend? Think again.</t3445> <t3446>This job is not really your profession.</t3446>
<t3447>There was no way to make Doctor Manette say another word.</t3447> <t3448>He would look up for a moment whenever told to, but no matter how much he was questioned, he would not utter a sound.</t3448> <t3449>He just kept working, working, working in silence, and Mr. Lorry's words seemed to fall into a void or bounce off an unresponsive wall.</t3449> <t3450>The only glimmer of hope Mr. Lorry could see was that the doctor would occasionally glance up even when not asked to.</t3450>
<t3451>At those moments, the doctor's eyes seemed to be tinged with curiosity or confusion, just like Mr. Manette trying to unravel the doubts in his mind.</t3451>
<t3452>Mr. Lorry immediately committed two most important things to memory; first, not to let Lucie know about this; second, to keep it hidden from those who knew the doctor.</t3452> <t3453>Together with Miss Pross, he promptly carried out the second important thing first, by spreading the news that the doctor was unwell and needed complete rest for a few days.</t3453> <t3454>As for Lucie, Miss Pross, out of kindness, had to deceive her; she wrote a letter saying that the doctor had urgent business and had to be away, and in the letter, she fabricated a story about receiving a few hurried lines from the doctor informing them.</t3454>
<t3455>Mr. Lorry was forced to use both of these methods in the hope that the doctor would soon regain his senses.</t3455> <t3456>In that case, he had another contingency plan; that is, to seek some advice which he thought would be best for Dr. Manette's condition.</t3456>
<t3457>Hopefully, the doctor will recover quickly, and thus it will be convenient for the third method. Mr. Lorry decided to observe Mr. Manette very carefully but as discreetly as possible.</t3457> <t3458>For the first time in his life, he arranged to temporarily leave his job at Tellson's and kept vigil by the window in the doctor's room.</t3458>
<t3459>He immediately saw that trying to start a conversation with Mr. Manette would only make things worse, as the more he was pressed, the more confused the doctor became. Mr. Lorry abandoned that idea on the very first day and decided to just sit silently in front of Mr. Manette, keeping a slight distance, as a way to counteract the doctor's delusions or prevent them from worsening.</t3459> <t3460>Therefore, he just sat by the window, reading or writing something, trying his best to appear comfortable and natural, as if in this room anyone was free to do whatever they wanted.</t3460>
<t3461>On the first day, whatever food and drink was given to Dr. Manette, he ate and drank, and kept diligently making shoes until there was no more light - it had gotten so dark that Mr. Lorry could no longer read or write, yet Dr. Manette continued working for another half hour before putting away his tools to resume the next morning.</t3461> <t3462>At that moment, Mr. Lorry stood up and said: −</t3462> <t3463>Do you want to go outside?</t3463> <t3464>The doctor bowed his head, looking at the floor on both sides as he used to, then looked up as he used to, and repeated in a soft voice as he used to: − Go outside? −</t3464> <t3465>Yes, take a walk with me.</t3465> <t3466>Why not?</t3466> <t3467>The doctor did not bother to answer, nor did he say anything further.</t3467> <t3468>But Mr. Lorry seemed to see the doctor - while hunched over on the bench in the dark, elbows on knees, head in hands - faintly mouthing the question “Why not?”.</t3468> <t3469>With the sharpness of a professional, Mr. Lorry recognized the favorable condition, and he decided to maintain it.</t3469>
<t3470>Miss Pross and he took turns during the night in the next room to watch over the doctor.</t3470> <t3471>Mr. Manette paced back and forth for a long time before lying down on the bed, but once he lay down, he slept soundly.</t3471> <t3472>In the morning, he got up early and went straight to the bench to continue making shoes.</t3472>
<t3473>On the second day, Mr. Lorry cheerfully greeted the doctor by name and talked about topics that the two had recently been discussing.</t3473> <t3474>Mr. Manette did not respond, but it was clear that he was listening to what Mr. Lorry was saying and was thinking about those matters, despite his disturbed mind.</t3474>
<t3475>That encouraged Mr. Lorry to call Miss Pross in to help several times a day; during those times, they calmly talked about Lucie, about the father who was present, as if nothing had happened.</t3475> <t3476>They tried to appear as if they were having a natural conversation, not too long, and not too often to avoid disturbing the doctor; and Mr. Lorry's friendly heart lit up when he saw that the doctor was looking up more often, showing some attention to the unusual things around him.</t3476>
<t3477>When night fell again, Mr. Lorry asked as he did yesterday: −</t3477> <t3478>Dear Doctor, do you want to go outside?</t3478> <t3479>Just like yesterday, Mr. Manette repeated: − Go outside? −</t3479> <t3480>Yes, take a walk with me.</t3480> <t3481>Why not?</t3481> <t3482>This time, Mr. Lorry pretended to leave when he saw the doctor say nothing, and was absent for about an hour before returning.</t3482> <t3483>During that time, Dr. Manette had moved to sit by the window and looked down at the plane tree; but seeing Mr. Lorry return, he quietly went back to the shoemaker's bench.</t3483>
<t3484>Time passed very slowly, and Mr. Lorry's hope gradually diminished, his heart growing heavier with each passing day, each day heavier than the last.</t3484> <t3485>The third day passed, then the fourth, and then the fifth.</t3485> <t3486>Five days, six days, seven days, eight days, nine days.</t3486>
<t3487>Hope gradually dwindling, the heart increasingly weighed down with worry, Mr. Lorry had endured nine days like this.</t3487> <t3488>This secret remained kept, Lucie still happily unaware; but he couldn't help noticing the shoemaker, whose initially rusty hands had become frighteningly proficient, never before had he made shoes with such focus, and never before had his hands been so swift and skillful, in the twilight of the ninth day.</t3488>
<t3489>19.</t3489> <t3490>Discussion</t3490>
<t3491>Exhausted from worrying and keeping watch, Mr. Lorry fell asleep in the next room.</t3491> <t3492>On the tense tenth morning, he was startled awake by the sunlight streaming into the room where sleep had overtaken him in the dark of night.</t3492>
<t3493>He rubbed his eyes and stood up; but even so, he was not sure he was fully awake.</t3493> <t3494>Because when he stepped to the doctor's room door and looked in, he saw the shoemaker's bench and tools had been put away, and the doctor was sitting properly reading a book by the window.</t3494> <t3495>He was dressed in his usual morning attire, and his face (Mr. Lorry saw clearly) though still pale, was calm and attentive.</t3495>
<t3496>Even when he was certain that he was truly awake, Mr. Lorry still felt dizzy for a moment, confused as to whether the shoe-making incident last night was a disturbing dream if he hadn't seen his friend in familiar attire and manner, doing his usual work; so, had all the signs of change that had worried him for the past nine days really happened?</t3496> <t3497>But that was just a question in the initial moments of confusion and astonishment, and the answer was already too clear.</t3497> <t3498>If his worries had no legitimate real cause, then why was he, Jarvis Lorry, here? Why had he fallen asleep, without changing clothes, on the sofa in Dr. Manette's consulting room, and why had he been standing, pondering various thoughts, in front of the doctor's bedroom door since early morning? A few minutes later, Miss Pross was standing next to him, whispering.</t3498> <t3499>If he had any doubts left, her words would surely dispel them; but by then, he was fully alert and no longer doubted.</t3499> <t3500>He advised Miss Pross to wait until the usual breakfast time and then meet the doctor as if nothing unusual had happened.</t3500> <t3501>If the doctor was in his usual familiar state, Mr. Lorry would then cautiously seek the advice and guidance he had been eagerly wanting to know during the past anxious days.</t3501>
<t3502>Following his advice, Miss Pross carefully did as instructed.</t3502> <t3503>After taking his usual leisurely time for meticulous grooming, Mr. Lorry appeared at breakfast in his familiar white linen suit and snug-fitting stockings.</t3503> <t3504>Dr. Manette was invited to breakfast as usual, and he went to the dining room.</t3504>
<t3505>If strictly following the cautious methods - Mr. Lorry saw it as the only safe way - it is understandable why at first Dr. Manette thought that his daughter's wedding had only taken place yesterday.</t3505> <t3506>The seemingly random but actually intentional hints about the day, date, and month made the doctor keep counting and thinking, clearly showing that he was not at ease.</t3506> <t3507>Otherwise, he was extremely calm, to the point that Mr. Lorry decided there was no need to go far to seek anyone's guidance anymore.</t3507> <t3508>Dr. Manette himself would indicate what needed to be done.</t3508>
<t3509>Therefore, when breakfast was over, the table cleared, and only the two of them remained, Mr. Lorry asked the doctor, his voice emotional: −</t3509> <t3510>Dear Mr. Manette, I am very eager to ask your opinion on a strange case that deeply concerns me; it is very strange to me, but for someone as knowledgeable as you, it might not be so.</t3510>
<t3511>Glancing at his pale hands, worn from the recent shoe-making work, the doctor showed a look of embarrassment but continued to listen attentively. He had glanced at his hands more than once.</t3511>
<t3512>− Dr. Manette, - Mr. Lorry said as he affectionately took the doctor's arm, - this is the case of a particularly close friend of mine.</t3512>
<t3513>Please take care and guide that person... and above all, for that person's daughter...</t3513> <t3514>that person's daughter, Mr. Manette</t3514><t3515>.</t3515>
<t3516>− As I understand it, - the doctor whispered, - it is a form of mental trauma...? − Correct! −</t3516> <t3517>Please explain clearly, - said the doctor. - Do not hide anything.</t3517>
<t3518>Mr. Lorry saw that they understood each other and continued.</t3518>
<t3519>− Dear Mr. Manette, this is a case of long-term injury, very severe and seriously affecting emotions, to...</t3519>
<t3520>...as you said, ...to the spirit.</t3520> <t3521>Spirit.</t3521> <t3522>This is a case of injury that this person has endured for an unknown amount of time, because I think even this person cannot calculate the duration, and there is no way to calculate it.</t3522> <t3523>This is a case of injury that this person has overcome, through a recovery process that even this person does not fully understand... as I have heard this person recount publicly in a very moving manner.</t3523> <t3524>This is a case of injury that this person has fully recovered from, to the extent of returning to an extremely intellectual individual, capable of utilizing both mental and physical efforts, and continuously adding new knowledge to an already profound understanding.</t3524>
<t3525>But unfortunately, recently... - Mr. Lorry paused to catch his breath, - ... there has been a slight relapse.</t3525>
<t3526>− How long has it been? - The doctor asked softly.</t3526>
<t3527>− Nine days and nights.</t3527>
<t3528>− How does it manifest?</t3528> <t3529>I guess, - the doctor looked at his hands again, - continuing the old pursuit related to that injury? −</t3529> <t3530>That's exactly right.</t3530>
<t3531>− So, have you ever seen, - the doctor asked, his voice clear and calm, though still gentle, - this person do that job before? −</t3531> <t3532>Once.</t3532>
<t3533>− And when it recurs, does this person resemble their former self in many aspects... or in every way? − I think they resemble in every way.</t3533>
<t3534>− He mentioned his daughter.</t3534> <t3535>Does his daughter know about the relapse? − No.</t3535> <t3536>This matter is kept secret, and I hope she will never find out.</t3536> <t3537>Only I know, along with one other trustworthy person.</t3537>
<t3538>The doctor tightly grasped Mr. Lorry's hand and whispered: − It's truly precious.</t3538> <t3539>So considerate! Mr. Lorry squeezed the doctor's hand in return, and both remained silent for a long time before Mr. Lorry carefully and affectionately chose his words: −</t3539> <t3540>Well, Mr. Manette, I'm just a businessman, I don't know how to handle such difficult and complicated matters.</t3540> <t3541>I don't have the appropriate knowledge nor the profound education; I need guidance.</t3541> <t3542>There is no one in this world I earnestly hope to guide me as much as you.</t3542> <t3543>Please tell me, how did it recur? Is there a risk of it happening again?</t3543> <t3544>Is there any way to prevent a recurrence?</t3544> <t3545>If it recurs, how should it be treated?</t3545> <t3546>What is the cause of this situation?</t3546> <t3547>What can I do for my friend?</t3547> <t3548>No one has ever been as eager to help a friend as I am to help mine, if only I knew how.</t3548> <t3549>But in this matter, I am powerless.</t3549> <t3550>If your profound intellect and experience could guide me, I could be of much more help; but groping in the dark like this, I am utterly useless.</t3550> <t3551>Please discuss with me, help me understand better, and show me how I can be more useful.</t3551>
<t3552>Hearing those earnest words, Dr. Manette sat in deep thought for a while, and Mr. Lorry did not press him.</t3552>
<t3553>− I think, - the doctor struggled to break the silence, - my friend, the recurrence as you described is not entirely unforeseen by this person.</t3553>
<t3554>− Is this person afraid of a relapse? - Mr. Lorry boldly asked.</t3554>
<t3555>− Of course I am scared, - the doctor shuddered involuntarily.</t3555> <t3556>- You cannot possibly understand how this fear constantly weighs on this person's mind, and how difficult it is... almost impossible... for this person to force themselves to speak out about the heavy burden in their heart.</t3556>
<t3557>− If one were to confide that secret burden to someone when it torments them, - Mr. Lorry asked, - would this person feel relieved? −</t3557> <t3558>I also think so.</t3558> <t3559>But as I have said, it is almost impossible.</t3559> <t3560>I even believe that... in some cases... it is completely impossible to do anything.</t3560>
<t3561>− Then, - Mr. Lorry gently placed his hand on the doctor's arm after a moment of silence from both, - in your opinion, what caused the relapse? −</t3561> <t3562>I believe that something extraordinarily powerful occurred, triggering a stream of thoughts and memories about the original cause of the mental trauma.</t3562> <t3563>Then this person clearly recalled many extremely painful related events all at once, I think.</t3563> <t3564>Perhaps for a long time, deep down, this person had feared remembering such related events... for instance, in such circumstances... for instance, on such an occasion.</t3564> <t3565>This person tried to prepare defensively but in vain; perhaps the very effort to mentally prepare made this person even less able to withstand that fear.</t3565>
<t3566>− When a relapse like that occurs, does the person remember what happened? - Mr. Lorry asked with a clearly hesitant voice.</t3566>
<t3567>Dr. Manette looked around the room, shook his head, and then quietly replied: −</t3567> <t3568>I don't remember anything at all.</t3568>
<t3569>− What about later? - Mr. Lorry reminded.</t3569>
<t3570>− Later on, I think there is much hope, - the doctor regained his assertive tone.</t3570> <t3571>- The merciful God has allowed this person to recover so quickly, so I have much hope.</t3571> <t3572>This person had succumbed to the pressure of a complex matter that he had long feared, anticipated, and wanted to resist; and now that the relapse is over, I hope that the worst is over.</t3572>
<t3573>− Great, great! Truly wonderful.</t3573> <t3574>I am grateful to you! - Mr. Lorry exclaimed.</t3574>
<t3575>− I am grateful to you! - The doctor said, bowing respectfully.</t3575>
<t3576>− There are two more issues I hope to be advised on, - Mr. Lorry said.</t3576> <t3577>- May I continue? −</t3577> <t3578>The more you say, the better it is for your friend, - the doctor extended his hand.</t3578>
<t3579>− So, the first issue.</t3579> <t3580>This person is eager to learn and has extraordinary determination; this person is extremely enthusiastic about acquiring specialized knowledge, conducting experiments, as well as many other tasks.</t3580> <t3581>So, is this person overworking their mind? −</t3581> <t3582>I don't think so.</t3582> <t3583>It could be that this person's mind is naturally like that, always busy.</t3583> <t3584>It might be partly due to their nature, and partly as a consequence of past hardships.</t3584> <t3585>The less they engage in healthy activities, the more their mind is at risk of weakening again.</t3585> <t3586>Perhaps this person has observed themselves and discovered this.</t3586>
<t3587>− Are you sure this person isn't under too much stress? −</t3587> <t3588>I think I'm absolutely sure.</t3588>
<t3589>− Mr. Manette, if this person overworks now...</t3589>
<t3590>− Mr. Lorry, I don't think that's the case.</t3590> <t3591>When the mind is under extreme pressure on one side, the other side must counteract to maintain balance.</t3591>
<t3592>− Excuse me, I am a person who only knows work.</t3592> <t3593>Let's assume this person has overworked; in that case, will this mental disorder recur? −</t3593> <t3594>I don't think so, - Dr. Manette asserted confidently. - I believe that only a single stream of association could cause a recurrence.</t3594> <t3595>But from now on, I think that stream of association would need an extraordinarily strong impact to repeat.</t3595> <t3596>After what has happened, and when this person has recovered, I find it hard to imagine what could cause such an extreme impact.</t3596> <t3597>I believe, and can say with certainty, that the possibility of recurrence is no longer there.</t3597>
<t3598>Dr. Manette spoke with the hesitation of someone who understands how fragile the structure of the mind can be, yet with the determination of someone who has gradually regained self-control through suffering and endurance.</t3598> <t3599>His friend had no right to undermine that belief.</t3599> <t3600>Mr. Lorry had to pretend to be reassured, more cheerful, and moved on to discuss the second and final issue.</t3600> <t3601>He found this the hardest point to address; but recalling the conversation with Miss Pross the previous Sunday and what he had witnessed over the past nine days, he knew he could not avoid it.</t3601>
<t3602>− Due to the impact of the temporary relapse that fortunately passed, Mr. Lorry cleared his throat, - this person continued to do the work they used to do, let's call it... blacksmithing, yes, blacksmithing.</t3602> <t3603>To illustrate the issue, let's assume that this person worked with a small forge during the time of hardship.</t3603> <t3604>Let's assume that we unexpectedly saw this person working with that forge as before.</t3604> <t3605>Isn't it pitiable that this person keeps that small forge close by?</t3605> <t3606>The doctor raised his hand to cover his forehead, his foot tapping restlessly on the floor.</t3606> <t3607>Mr. Lorry continued speaking, his eyes anxiously watching his friend: −</t3607> <t3608>This person always keeps that forge.</t3608> <t3609>Wouldn't it be better for him to discard that thing?</t3609> <t3610>The doctor’s hand still covered his forehead, his foot still tapping restlessly on the floor.</t3610>
<t3611>− Do you find it difficult to instruct me on this matter? - Mr. Lorry said.</t3611> <t3612>- I am well aware that this is a delicate question.</t3612> <t3613>However, I think that...</t3613> <t3614>At this point, he shook his head and fell silent.</t3614>
<t3615>− You see, - Dr. Manette turned to look at his friend after a moment of confused silence, - it is indeed difficult to thoroughly explain what is going on in the mind of this poor fellow.</t3615> <t3616>This person had once desperately wished to do that work and was very happy to do it; surely this helped him alleviate his suffering greatly by replacing the complex activity of the mind with the complex activity of the hands; and in doing so, he became increasingly proficient, the dexterity of his hands helped him forget the torment in his mind to the extent that he could not bear the thought of being separated from that work.</t3616> <t3617>Even now, when I see that he is more hopeful about himself than ever before, even speaking about himself with confidence, the thought of needing the old work and not having it suddenly horrifies him, like the fear in the heart of a child who has once been lost from his mother.</t3617>
<t3618>He truly looked like a lost child when he looked straight into Mr. Lorry's eyes.</t3618>
<t3619>− But could it be...</t3619> <t3620>Please, sir! I need guidance, because a slow-witted person like me only knows how to deal with tangible things like coins, money, and paper bills...</t3620> <t3621>If you keep holding onto those tools, will you never forget that fear?</t3621> <t3622>If those things are no longer there, Mr. Manette, wouldn't that fear disappear as well?</t3622> <t3623>In short, keeping that forge means constant worry and suffering, right? Another moment of silence.</t3623>
<t3624>− Well, you see, - the doctor's voice trembled, - it's like an old friend.</t3624>
<t3625>− If it were me, I wouldn't keep it, - Mr. Lorry shook his head; the more anxious the doctor became, the more confident he felt. - I would advise this person to give it up.</t3625> <t3626>I just need your permission.</t3626> <t3627>I am sure that keeping it is of no use.</t3627> <t3628>Come on! Please allow me, as a kind person.</t3628> <t3629>For the sake of this person's daughter, Mr. Manette!</t3629> <t3630>How strange it is to witness the doctor's inner turmoil! −</t3630> <t3631>Then for the sake of that girl, do it; I give my permission.</t3631> <t3632>But if it were me, I wouldn't do it in front of this person.</t3632> <t3633>Dispose of those things when he is absent; let him remember his old friend after he has gone far away.</t3633>
<t3634>Mr. Lorry agreed immediately and the consultation ended.</t3634> <t3635>They spent the whole day enjoying the countryside, and the doctor had completely recovered.</t3635> <t3636>For the next three days, he remained as healthy as ever, and on the fourteenth day, he set out to meet Lucie and her husband.</t3636> <t3637>Mr. Lorry had previously explained to Mr. Manette how they had fabricated a story to explain the doctor's absence, and Mr. Manette had used that pretext to write to Lucie, so she suspected nothing.</t3637>
<t3638>The day the doctor left home, that night Mr. Lorry entered the doctor's room carrying an axe, a saw, a chisel, and a hammer, with Miss Pross assisting by holding a lamp.</t3638> <t3639>In the room, behind closed doors, in an atmosphere of mystery and guilt, Mr. Lorry smashed the shoemaker's bench to pieces while Miss Pross held the candle to illuminate the scene as if participating in a murder - judging by her fierce expression, Miss Pross indeed seemed well-suited to this scheme.</t3639> <t3640>The remains were chopped up to facilitate burning, and the cremation began immediately in the kitchen stove; the tools, shoes, and leather pieces were buried in the garden.</t3640> <t3641>For those with honest souls, this secretive destruction was truly cruel, so Mr. Lorry and Miss Pross, while busily carrying out the act and erasing all traces, both inwardly and outwardly resembled two accomplices committing a heinous crime.</t3641>
<t3642>20.</t3642> <t3643>Request</t3643>
<t3644>When the newlywed couple returned, the first person to congratulate them was Sydney Carton.</t3644> <t3645>He arrived a few hours after they got home.</t3645> <t3646>His clothes, appearance, and demeanor were no better, but Carton had a certain firmness and reliability that Charles Darnay had never seen before.</t3646>
<t3647>Waiting for a convenient moment, he pulled Darnay to the window to speak privately so that no one could hear.</t3647>
<t3648>− Mr. Darnay, - Carton said, - I hope we can be friends.</t3648>
<t3649>− We are already friends, I hope so.</t3649>
<t3650>− You saying that is really kind and very polite; but my intention has nothing to do with politeness.</t3650> <t3651>Honestly, when I said I hoped we could be friends, I wasn't just being polite.</t3651>
<t3652>Charles Darnay naturally had to ask again, very cheerfully and kindly, what Carton meant.</t3652>
<t3653>− I swear, - Carton said with a smile, - it's easy for me to understand myself but hard to make others understand my thoughts.</t3653> <t3654>But I will try to explain.</t3654>
<t3655>Do you remember that time when I was more... more drunk than usual? −</t3655> <t3656>I still remember the time when you forced me to admit that you were too drunk.</t3656>
<t3657>− I remember too.</t3657> <t3658>That time still haunts me because I can never forget it.</t3658> <t3659>I hope that on the day of final judgment, my regret will be considered!</t3659> <t3660>Don't panic, I'm not preaching.</t3660>
<t3661>− I am not panicking.</t3661> <t3662>With someone as sincere as you, why would I panic?</t3662>
<t3663>− Ah! - Carton nonchalantly waved his hand as if to dismiss Darnay's words.</t3663>
<t3664>- That time I was drunk; one of the many times like that, you know; I was rude when talking about whether I liked or disliked you.</t3664> <t3665>I hope you can forget it.</t3665>
<t3666>− I forgot a long time ago.</t3666>
<t3667>− Don't be so formal! But Mr. Darnay, I am not as forgetful as you.</t3667> <t3668>I have no way to forget, and a random remark cannot help me forget.</t3668>
<t3669>− If that was a careless remark, then I apologize to you, - Darnay replied. - I answered that way because I thought it was not important, but I am surprised that you are so concerned and want to move on.</t3669> <t3670>I tell you, on the honor of a gentleman, that I have long forgotten about it.</t3670> <t3671>Good Lord, what is there to it!</t3671> <t3672>Isn't there anything more important for me to remember, especially when you were the one who helped me that day? −</t3672> <t3673>That help, - Carton said - since you put it that way, I must confess to you, at that time I did it merely as a professional trick, I did it regardless of what consequences you might face...</t3673> <t3674>Please remember! I am speaking of my feelings back then; I am talking about the past.</t3674>
<t3675>− You are underestimating that gratitude again, - Darnay replied, - but I don't want to argue with your reckless words.</t3675>
<t3676>− That is the complete truth, Mr. Darnay, believe me! I digressed; I was talking about our friends.</t3676> <t3677>There, you know me, you know I don't have the talent to rise higher, to be better like everyone else.</t3677> <t3678>If you still have doubts, just ask Stryver and he will tell you this.</t3678>
<t3679>− I prefer to have my own opinion, without needing to rely on him.</t3679>
<t3680>− Alright! Anyway, you know that I am a worthless person, incapable of doing anything good and will never be able to.</t3680>
<t3681>− I don't know about your "never ever" situation.</t3681>
<t3682>− But I know, and you must believe me.</t3682> <t3683>Well! If you can tolerate someone like me, a person with a bad reputation who occasionally visits this place, then I would like to come here as someone granted a favor; you can consider me as a discarded piece of furniture, kept because of its past usefulness, and no one bothers to notice.</t3683> <t3684>And I want to add that if it weren't for the fact that I discovered we look alike, I would just be a discard.</t3684> <t3685>I will not abuse your permission.</t3685> <t3686>I bet one hundred to one that I will only come here four times a year at most.</t3686> <t3687>If permitted, I dare say I would want nothing more.</t3687>
<t3688>− Will you come? −</t3688> <t3689>That was a subtle way of saying that my suggestion had been approved.</t3689>
<t3690>Thank you, Darnay.</t3690> <t3691>May I call you by your first name to be more familiar? −</t3691> <t3692>I think so too, Carton, from now on.</t3692>
<t3693>They shook hands and Sydney turned on his heel.</t3693> <t3694>Just a minute later, he once again had the completely disheveled appearance he wore every day.</t3694>
<t3695>After the guest had left, in the evening sitting with Miss Pross, the doctor, and Mr. Lorry, Charles Darnay briefly mentioned this conversation and commented on Sydney Carton as a matter of carelessness and defiance.</t3695> <t3696>He spoke briefly, without implying any harshness or criticism towards his friend, only mentioning things that everyone had already seen Sydney reveal.</t3696>
<t3697>He did not expect that those words would be remembered by his beautiful young wife; but later, when he returned to their private room to meet Lucie, he saw her waiting with the familiar graceful wrinkle clearly etched on her forehead.</t3697>
<t3698>− Do we have something to worry about tonight? - Darnay said as he wrapped his arm around her.</t3698>
<t3699>− That's right, Charles, - With her hand placed on her husband's chest, Lucie looked at him intently, questioning.</t3699> <t3700>- We have something to worry about tonight, because we have something to be concerned about tonight.</t3700>
<t3701>− What is it, Lucie?</t3701> <t3702>−</t3702> <t3703>You have to promise not to press me on things I don't want to answer, okay? −</t3703> <t3704>Promise? Is there anything I wouldn't promise you, my love? Truly, what wouldn't I promise when one hand brushes aside the golden lock of hair on your cheek and the other rests on your chest where your heart belongs to me! −</t3704> <t3705>Charles, I think Mr. Carton deserves more attention and respect than what you said about him tonight.</t3705>
<t3706>− Really, my love? Why do you say that? −</t3706> <t3707>That's something you shouldn't ask.</t3707> <t3708>But I think... I know... he deserves it.</t3708>
<t3709>− If you know that, it's enough.</t3709> <t3710>So, what do you want me to do, my love? −</t3710> <t3711>My love, I want you to always be generous with him, forgiving his mistakes when he's not around.</t3711> <t3712>I want you to believe that he is a person whose heart is almost always closed, bearing many deep scars.</t3712> <t3713>My love, I have seen that heart bleed.</t3713>
<t3714>− I am truly heartbroken to know that I have treated him so poorly, Charles Darnay exclaimed in astonishment.</t3714> <t3715>- I never thought he was that sensitive.</t3715>
<t3716>− That's right, my love.</t3716> <t3717>I'm afraid he can't change; there's no hope of improving his character or fate.</t3717> <t3718>But I believe he is capable of doing many kind, good, and even chivalrous things.</t3718>
<t3719>The pure trust given to that failure made Lucie so radiantly beautiful that her husband could silently gaze at her for hours.</t3719>
<t3720>− My dear! - Lucie nestled close to him, resting her head on his chest, looking up.</t3720> <t3721>- Please remember how happy we are while he is so miserable!</t3721> <t3722>Those earnest words moved Darnay.</t3722>
<t3723>− I will remember that forever, my love! I will remember it for the rest of my life.</t3723>
<t3724>He bent down to her golden hair, kissed Lucie's rosy lips, and wrapped his arms around her.</t3724> <t3725>If some suffering wanderer were counting his steps through the night streets and heard her innocent confession, saw the tears of compassion welling up in her blue eyes, which her husband dried with kisses, he would surely cry out to the night for the first time - words that would never escape our lips: −</t3725> <t3726>God bless her for having compassion on me!</t3726>
<t3727>21.</t3727> <t3728>Echoing footsteps</t3728>
<t3729>A strange corner of the street echoed with sounds, as mentioned in the previous part, the corner of the street had the house of the doctor.</t3729> <t3730>Always busy with the golden thread entwining her husband, her father, herself, and the old nanny who was also a companion, and a peaceful life, Lucie sat in the quiet house on that silent street corner full of echoes, listening to the footsteps of the years reverberating.</t3730>
<t3731>At first, even though she was a young wife full of happiness, there were moments when she let go of her work, her eyes tinged with sadness.</t3731> <t3732>Because in those echoes, she felt something would come, something faint, distant, and vague that made her heart restless.</t3732> <t3733>Her heart wavered between hope and doubt - the hope of a new and strange love; the doubt of not knowing how much longer she would remain in this world to enjoy that love.</t3733>
<t3734>Amidst those echoes, there were moments when the sound of her early footsteps descending into the grave resounded; and thinking of the husband left alone mourning his wife, she could not hold back the tears streaming down.</t3734>
<t3735>Time passed, and now she had little Lucie in her arms.</t3735> <t3736>Then, amidst the echoes approaching, there were the tiny footsteps and the babbling of a child.</t3736> <t3737>Despite the loud reverberations, the young mother by the cradle only heard those waves of happiness.</t3737> <t3738>Then the awaited echoes arrived, and this cool, shaded house was filled with the laughter of children; and God, the friend of children, the supreme being to whom she had entrusted her worries, seemed to have embraced her child - just as He had welcomed the Holy Infant - and transformed it into a divine joy for the young mother.</t3738>
<t3739>Always busy with the golden thread that binds everyone together, weaving her efforts to build happiness into their lives without revealing herself, Lucie hears in the echoes of time the tender, comforting reverberations.</t3739> <t3740>Among them are the echoes of her husband's steady and successful footsteps, and her father's stable and healthy steps.</t3740> <t3741>There, under the lime tree in the garden, Miss Pross, like an untamed warhorse that has been bridled and tamed with a whip, is snorting, stamping, and stirring up other echoes!</t3741> <t3742>Even when sorrowful echoes resound, those reverberations are neither cruel nor harsh.</t3742> <t3743>Even when the golden hair like Lucie's, glowing with a halo around the head of the son lying on the pillow about to depart, and the boy says with a radiant smile, "Papa and maman, I am very sorry to leave you and my pretty sister; but God has called and I must go!" the tears wetting the mother's cheeks are not of utmost despair as the little soul leaves the arms entrusted by God.</t3743> <t3744>Painful but accepting.</t3744> <t3745>They will meet again before God. Oh, hallowed be Thy name!</t3745> <t3746>Thus, the rustling of Angel wings blends with other echoes, reverberations not entirely earthly but imbued with the breath of Heaven.</t3746> <t3747>Whispering softly in the mother's ear, the sigh of the wind blowing over the small grave in the garden also carries the sound of little Lucie diligently and amusingly doing her morning duties, or dressing her doll on her mother's footstool, chattering in the language of both cities that are her homelands.</t3747>
<t3748>Those echoes rarely reflected the true footsteps of Sydney Carton.</t3748> <t3749>About six times a year at most, he exercised the privilege of visiting this house without prior invitation, often spending the entire evening with everyone as he used to.</t3749> <t3750>He never came when he reeked of alcohol.</t3750> <t3751>And there was another thing related to Carton that silently echoed, something that, through many generations, every true reverberation quietly continued.</t3751>
<t3752>A man who truly loves a woman, even if his love is unrequited but remains devoted without resentment, will always hold a special place in the hearts of her children when she becomes a wife and mother - a subtle compassion instinctively reserved for him.</t3752> <t3753>What hidden emotions resonate in such situations? There is no echo to reveal these occurrences, and it is the same for Carton.</t3753> <t3754>He was the first stranger to whom little Lucie extended her chubby hands, and he held a place in her life.</t3754> <t3755>Even the little boy who passed away near the end still said, "Poor Carton! Kiss him for me!".</t3755>
<t3756>Stryver continued to push aggressively in the legal field, like a large engine-driven ship cutting through murky waters, dragging his capable friend behind like a small boat.</t3756> <t3757>As boats being towed are often those that have met with severe misfortune and mostly end up sinking, Sydney kept sinking deeper into that life.</t3757> <t3758>But Sydney's weakness and deeply ingrained habits, unfortunately, were too weak and too deeply ingrained for him to have any consciousness of wanting to abandon or feel ashamed; he chose that way of life, no longer thinking of escaping the state of being a Jackal to a Lion - unlike the true wild dogs that might dream of becoming a mighty lion.</t3758> <t3759>Stryver, already wealthy, married a flamboyant widow with assets and three children, three kids who had nothing particularly outstanding except for their straight hair on their round heads.</t3759>
<t3760>From every pore exuded the most obnoxious air of superiority, Stryver had once made these three noble offspring walk before him like three sheep to the quiet corner of Soho, and he had proposed to Lucie's husband to take them as students.</t3760> <t3761>Stryver had said very delicately: "Hey friend!</t3761> <t3762>Here are three pieces of cheese bread I brought for your marriage adventure, Darnay!" The fact that these three pieces of cheese bread were politely refused made Stryver unbearably angry, but later it became a useful lesson for him to teach the three noble offspring to beware of the pride of beggars, just like that fellow countryman tutor.</t3762> <t3763>When his belly was full of wine, Stryver would also passionately talk about Lucie, about the tricks she used to "trap" him, and about his own counter-tricks to "not get caught in the trap."</t3763> <t3764>Stryver's colleagues at the Supreme Court would occasionally gather to drink their fill and listen to these tall tales, but no one believed them; they dismissed the fabrications because they thought Stryver repeated them so often that he himself came to believe them - anyone who said so and was heard by Stryver would only worsen their own fault beyond redemption, the only recourse being to drag the offender to some suitable secluded spot and hang them for their crime.</t3764>
<t3765>Those were the echoes that Lucie, sometimes sad, sometimes joyful, had heard at the corner of this resonant street until her little daughter turned six years old.</t3765> <t3766>Oh, how affectionate were the echoes of the child's footsteps, along with the father's steps - always brisk and calm - and needless to say, the footsteps of the loving husband.</t3766> <t3767>Needless to say, every gentle echo in this close-knit family, thanks to Lucie's skillful and clever management that made everything prosperous, was sweet music to her.</t3767> <t3768>Needless to say, how soothing were the echoes around Lucie when countless times Mr. Manette told her that her daughter, now married (if that was indeed the case), was even more devoted to her father than when she was single, and when countless times Darnay told her that it seemed his wife's filial piety did not diminish the love or support she gave to her husband, he asked her: "My dear, what magic is it that you manage everything so perfectly for everyone, as if the whole family were just one person, yet you never seem hurried or busy?" But there were other echoes from afar that had been roaring and threatening this corner during that time.</t3768> <t3769>Now, as little Lucie turned six years old, those echoes began to rumble terrifyingly like the horrifying stormy seas echoing from France.</t3769>
<t3770>On a mid-July evening in 1789, Mr. Lorry from Tellson's Bank came by late and sat down next to Lucie and her husband by the dark window.</t3770> <t3771>That night was sultry and thunderous, and all three remembered a past Sunday night when they also sat here watching the lightning tear through the sky.</t3771>
<t3772>Mr. Lorry said while pushing back his brown wig: −</t3772> <t3773>I'm starting to think about having to stay the night at Tellson's.</t3773> <t3774>The work there is so overwhelming that no one knows what to do first or how to manage.</t3774> <t3775>There is such great unrest in Paris that people are rushing to deposit their money in this bank! Clients over there are entrusting their assets to Tellson's so overwhelmingly that it can't keep up.</t3775> <t3776>Clearly, many of them have gone mad in their desire to transfer their wealth to England.</t3776>
<t3777>− That's concerning - Darnay said.</t3777>
<t3778>− You said it's concerning, didn't you, Darnay?</t3778> <t3779>That's right, but I don't know why.</t3779> <t3780>People are really unreasonable! Many of us at Tellson are already old, and we truly cannot be bothered with unusual matters without a valid reason.</t3780>
<t3781>− Anyway, you know the situation is worryingly unstable, Darnay said.</t3781>
<t3782>− Certainly, - Mr. Lorry agreed, trying to convince himself that he was just in a bad mood and merely complaining to get it off his chest.</t3782> <t3783>- But after a long troublesome day, I'm irritated and want to grumble.</t3783> <t3784>Where is Mr. Manette? − Here I am, - said the doctor, entering the dark living room at that very moment.</t3784>
<t3785>− I'm so glad you're home; because all these urgent and worrying matters have been surrounding me all day, causing me to lose my temper unreasonably.</t3785> <t3786>You didn't go out for a walk, did you? −</t3786> <t3787>No, I was planning to play chess with you, if you like, - the doctor said.</t3787>
<t3788>− I think I don't like it, to be honest.</t3788> <t3789>I can't compete with you tonight.</t3789> <t3790>Is there any tea left, Lucie?</t3790> <t3791>I can't see any.</t3791>
<t3792>− Of course there is, I have saved it for you.</t3792>
<t3793>− Thank you, my dear.</t3793> <t3794>And has my little darling already gone to bed with a warm and cozy mattress? −</t3794> <t3795>And she is sleeping soundly.</t3795>
<t3796>− That's good; everything is peaceful!</t3796> <t3797>I see no reason why this place wouldn't be peaceful, thank God; but I'm exhausted from today, I don't have the energy I used to when I was young!</t3797> <t3798>Here's the tea, you're so considerate! Thank you.</t3798> <t3799>Now, come sit around this table with us, let's sit quietly and listen to the echoes that you have hypothesized about.</t3799>
<t3800>− Hypothesis? It's just imagination.</t3800>
<t3801>− Just imagine, my dear, - Mr. Lorry said while gently patting Lucie's hand.</t3801> <t3802>- These echoes are many and very loud, aren't they?</t3802> <t3803>Just listen and you'll see!</t3803> <t3804>Footsteps rushing in, frenzied, dangerous, invading anyone's life, footsteps not easily washed clean once stained with blood, the furious footsteps in distant Saint Antoine, while everyone sits around the dark window in London.</t3804>
<t3805>That same morning in Saint Antoine, a forest of ragged, dark-skinned people, resembling scarecrows, was bustling and overflowing. The sunlight glinted off this wave of heads, reflecting the steel gleam of bayonets and swords.</t3805> <t3806>A terrifying roar erupted from the throat of Saint Antoine, and a sea of bare arms rose to the sky, looking like withered branches in the winter wind, with every finger fiercely gripping any weapon or anything that could be used as a weapon, scavenged from every possible depth.</t3806>
<t3807>Who distributed the weapons, where they came from, through which intermediaries, no one in that sea of people knew; they only saw the weapons, batch after batch of twenty, being thrown out and then suddenly raised above the crowd like lightning; not only muskets - there were also ammunition, gunpowder, lead bullets, iron bars, wooden sticks, knives, axes, pickaxes, every kind of weapon that a frenzied mind could find or create.</t3807> <t3808>Those who couldn't grab anything to use as a weapon used their bleeding hands to pry bricks from the walls.</t3808> <t3809>Every pulse and heartbeat in Saint Antoine was throbbing, burning hot.</t3809> <t3810>Everyone here considered their lives as nothing and were madly ready to sacrifice them.</t3810>
<t3811>Just as all boiling, swirling waters are drawn towards the center, all the fierce upheavals here revolve around Defarge's tavern, and every person immersed in this cauldron of fire is pulled into the most furious vortex, where Defarge himself, smeared with sweat and gunpowder, is strenuously issuing orders, distributing weapons, shoving one person back, pushing another forward, and taking guns from some to give to others.</t3811>
<t3812>− Stand close to me, Jacques Three, - Defarge shouted, - and you, Jacques One and Two, split up and lead those patriots over there, as many as possible.</t3812> <t3813>Have you seen my wife? −</t3813> <t3814>Here I am! Here I am! - her voice was as calm as ever, but today she was not knitting.</t3814> <t3815>Instead of holding the familiar soft tools, her right hand was gripping a hatchet, and tucked into her belt were a pistol and a formidable knife.</t3815>
<t3816>− Where are you planning to go? −</t3816> <t3817>Right now, I'm going with you, - she said. - You'll see me leading the sisters right away.</t3817>
<t3818>− Then let's go! - Defarge shouted loudly, his voice booming.</t3818> <t3819>- Patriots and friends, be ready! The Bastille! With a roar as if every breath in France had crystallized into that dreadful name, the sea of people surged, wave after wave, layer after layer, flooding into the city, heading towards that place.</t3819> <t3820>The alarm bells rang loudly, drums beat incessantly, the furious sea roared, crashing waves into a new shore, the attack began.</t3820>
<t3821>Crossing deep moats, rushing over suspension bridges, overcoming massive stone walls, surging towards eight large towers, cannons and muskets exchanging fire, flames and smoke enveloping everything.</t3821> <t3822>Through the smoke and fire - in the thick haze of flames and smoke, the sea of people lifted Defarge onto the cannon and he immediately became an artilleryman.</t3822> <t3823>The innkeeper fired continuously like a valiant warrior.</t3823>
<t3824>For two hours straight.</t3824>
<t3825>Deep trenches, suspension bridges, massive stone walls, leading to eight large towers, cannons, fire tubes, smoke and flames.</t3825> <t3826>A suspension bridge has been blown up! −</t3826> <t3827>Take action, all of you, take action!</t3827> <t3828>Take action, Jacques One, Jacques Two, Jacques One Thousand, Jacques Two Thousand, Jacques Twenty-Five Thousand; in the name of all Angels and Demons...</t3828> <t3829>Any demon or god will do...</t3829> <t3830>Take action! - Tavern owner Defarge kept firing, the cannon had heated up.</t3830>
<t3831>− In my opinion, sisters! - His wife shouted. - Come on! We women are just as good at killing as men when it comes to it! - And her words were met with a deafening, eager scream from a forest of women armed with all kinds of weapons but sharing the same hunger and hatred.</t3831>
<t3832>Artillery, fire tubes, smoke and flames; but still not past the deep moat, the hanging bridge, the massive stone walls, and not yet reaching the eight large towers.</t3832> <t3833>The raging sea transformed by the waves of fallen casualties. Weapons gleaming, torches blazing brightly, convoys of carts carrying wet straw, layers upon layers of people from all directions charging towards the nearby obstacles, the shouts, the gunfire, the curses, death as light as a feather, the thunderous destruction, the sea of people roaring and surging forward; but still not past the deep moat, the hanging bridge, the massive stone walls, and not yet reaching the eight large towers, and the tavern keeper Defarge still beside the cannon, hot from four hours of fierce firepower.</t3833>
<t3834>A white flag was raised from within the fortress, then negotiations - an event that occurred vaguely amidst this frenzied storm, no one could hear anything - suddenly the sea of people surged higher and higher, spreading wider and wider, and swept the tavern owner Defarge onto a lowered drawbridge, crossing the massive outer stone walls, and into the midst of the eight towers that had just fallen!</t3834> <t3835>That sea of people pushed him forward irresistibly, he couldn't even stop to catch his breath or look back, as if he were struggling in the fierce waves of the Southern sea, until he was herded into the forecourt of the Bastille prison.</t3835> <t3836>There, leaning against a corner of the wall, he strained to look around.</t3836> <t3837>Jacques Three was nearby; the shadow of Madame Defarge, still commanding her group of women, appeared far inside, a knife gleaming in her hand.</t3837> <t3838>Everywhere was tumultuous, joyous, the deafening sound of madness, no one could hear anyone else and everyone gestured wildly like a brutal pantomime.</t3838>
<t3839>− Prisoner! − Files! −</t3839> <t3840>Secret cell! − Torture instruments! −</t3840> <t3841>Prisoner! Among those shouts and the countless indistinct clamors, "Prisoner!" was the loudest roar carried by the sea of people, echoing, continuing seemingly endlessly.</t3841> <t3842>When the first waves of people surged through, dragging along the prison wardens, threatening to kill them immediately if they did not reveal any secret corners, Defarge used his strong hand to grab the neck of a jailer - a gray-haired man holding a burning torch - pulled him out, pushed him against the wall, and then stood blocking in front of him.</t3842>
<t3843>− Show the way to the North Tower! - Defarge said. - Hurry up! − I will show you right away if you come with me, - the person replied.</t3843> <t3844>- But there is no one there.</t3844>
<t3845>− One Hundred and Five, North Tower, what does it mean? - Defarge asked. - Speak quickly.</t3845>
<t3846>− What do you mean, sir? −</t3846> <t3847>Is that the prisoner or the cell?</t3847> <t3848>Or do you want me to punch you to death! −</t3848> <t3849>Kill him! - Jacques Ba shouted, having just approached.</t3849>
<t3850>− Sir, that is the prison cell.</t3850>
<t3851>− Take me there! −</t3851> <t3852>Then go this way.</t3852>
<t3853>With a familiar hunger, Jacques Three was clearly disappointed when the conversation turned away from the promise of bloodshed, so he grabbed Defarge's arm and the arm of the prison guard.</t3853> <t3854>The three heads huddled together in a brief exchange, and even then they could barely hear each other, the deafening roar of the surrounding sea of people storming the fortress, flooding the courtyards, passageways, and staircases.</t3854>
<t3855>All around outside, the roar of the crowd was deafening, and every now and then, a chaotic scream would burst forth like a wave crashing into the sky.</t3855>
<t3856>Passing through the dark dungeons that had never seen daylight, crossing the prison doors, the grimy and ghastly cells, descending the cavern-like steps, then climbing up the jagged stone stairs steeper than a dry waterfall rather than a staircase, Defarge, the jailer, and Jacques Three, holding hands tightly, tried to move as quickly as possible.</t3856> <t3857>From time to time, especially at the beginning, the sea of people surged forward, sweeping them along; but when they had finished descending and continued up a spiral staircase to a high tower, only the three of them remained.</t3857> <t3858>Here, surrounded by thick walls and arches, the storm inside and outside the fortress was just a faint sound, unlike the noise they had just escaped that had nearly destroyed the hearing ability of the three.</t3858>
<t3859>The jailer stopped at a low door, inserted a creaky key into the lock, slowly opened the door, and said as all three bowed their heads to enter: −</t3859> <t3860>One Hundred and Five, North Tower! Inside, there was a window without glass, densely barred, high on the wall, and in front of the door, a stone slab blocked the view, so one had to crouch down and look up to see a patch of sky.</t3860> <t3861>A few steps away was a small chimney, also densely barred.</t3861> <t3862>On the hearth was a pile of long-burned wood ashes.</t3862> <t3863>A stool, a table, a straw bed.</t3863> <t3864>Four blackened walls, and on one wall, a rusty iron ring was attached.</t3864>
<t3865>− Slowly move the torch along these walls so I can take a look, - Defarge said to the jailer.</t3865>
<t3866>This person obeyed, and Defarge attentively followed the beam of light.</t3866>
<t3867>− Stop!...</t3867> <t3868>Look, Jacques! − “A. M.”! - Jacques Ba said, almost groaning as he read those initials eagerly.</t3868>
<t3869>− "Alexandre Manette," Defarge whispered, tracing the letters with his gunpowder-stained dark finger.</t3869> <t3870>- And here he carved the words "poor doctor".</t3870> <t3871>And it was certainly him, no one else, who carved these tally marks on this stone.</t3871> <t3872>What are you holding?</t3872> <t3873>A crowbar?</t3873> <t3874>Give it to me! Defarge still held the cannon's firing stick in his hand.</t3874> <t3875>He immediately exchanged tools with Jacques Three and then turned to smash the worm-eaten stool and table with a few heavy blows.</t3875>
<t3876>− Hold the torch a little higher! - In an indignant voice, he said to the jailer and then turned to Jacques.</t3876> <t3877>- Search thoroughly in that pile of debris, Jacques.</t3877> <t3878>Here! Take my knife! - He tossed the knife to his friend. - Rip the bed apart, search in the straw mattress.</t3878> <t3879>Hold the torch higher, you!</t3879> <t3880>After glaring and intimidating the jailer, Defarge crawled on the fireplace floor, intently looking up the chimney, using a crowbar to tap, pry at the sides of the fireplace, and try to dislodge the iron bars crisscrossing the chimney hole.</t3880> <t3881>A few minutes later, plaster and dust fell down, he turned his face away to avoid it; then carefully groped and searched through the old ashes and in the chimney nook where the crowbar had managed to reach.</t3881>
<t3882>− Is there nothing in that pile of straw, Jacques? −</t3882> <t3883>There's nothing.</t3883>
<t3884>− Gather everything in the middle of the room.</t3884> <t3885>Alright! Burn it, you there! The jailer lit a torch to that pile, and the straw and wood blazed fiercely.</t3885>
<t3886>Bending down again to pass through the low archway, all three left the fire burning and retraced their steps back to the courtyard; with each step downward, their hearing seemed to recover, until they were once again in the midst of the frenzied crowd.</t3886>
<t3887>The sea of people was still surging, fervently searching for Defarge.</t3887>
<t3888>The people of Saint Antoine were clamoring for the tavern owner to lead the group guarding the chief officer, who had fired upon the populace to protect the Bastille prison.</t3888> <t3889>Otherwise, they would not be able to bring the officer to the Town Hall for trial.</t3889> <t3890>If not, the officer would escape, and those who had shed blood would not get their revenge (after so many worthless years, the blood of commoners suddenly had some value).</t3890>
<t3891>Amidst the sea of humanity roaring and arguing aggressively as if wanting to drown the old official wearing a gray coat and a red medal, there was only one person who remained completely calm, and that was a woman.</t3891>
<t3892>− There, my husband is here! - She shouted loudly, pointing. - There's Defarge! She stood close beside the fierce old official; and still remained close beside him; she stayed close beside him as the crowd moved through the streets while Defarge and the mob led that person away; still close beside him when he was struck from behind; still close beside him when he endured a long-accumulated rain of punches and kicks; still close beside him when that person collapsed under the blows, and then suddenly she became very excited, stepping on his neck and drawing a very long, cruel knife - chopping off his head.</t3892>
<t3893>It was time for the people of Saint Antoine to carry out the horrifying idea of hanging someone from a lamppost to show who they were and what they could do.</t3893> <t3894>The blood of the people of Saint Antoine had boiled, and the blood of the cruel, iron-fisted regime had flowed - on the steps of the City Hall where the body of the governor lay - under the shoes of Madame Defarge where she stepped on the body to steady herself and sever the head.</t3894>
<t3895>− Down with the lamppost over there! - The people of Saint Antoine shouted after glaring around to find more new people to execute.</t3895> <t3896>- There's another one of the old officer's guards here! - The guard was hanged and dangled, and the sea of people surged forward, surged forward.</t3896>
<t3897>The sea is endlessly threatening and dark; the sea rises in waves, wave after wave of destruction; the sea is unfathomably deep; the sea is immensely powerful.</t3897> <t3898>The sea is brutally turbulent, causing people to sway, roaring with the call for revenge, forging ruthless faces in the furnace of suffering until no trace of compassion remains.</t3898>
<t3899>But in the sea of people with faces brimming with vigorous energy and rage, there were two groups completely different from the crowd - each group consisting of seven faces - so different that the surging waves carrying more and more drifting fragments of memories could not submerge them.</t3899>
<t3900>The seven faces belong to seven prisoners, unexpectedly freed by a storm that shattered their prison, now being carried on the heads of a sea of people; all are terrified, all are lost, all are bewildered as if the Last Judgment has come and the rejoicing crowd are the souls of the dead.</t3900> <t3901>Another seven faces, held higher, are seven heads, with eyelids half-closed over eyes staring blankly, awaiting Judgment Day.</t3901> <t3902>These faces are motionless, frozen with a concentrated emotion; faces turned to stone in the midst of horror, not yet able to open wide their eyes to witness the pale lips screaming "MURDERERS!".</t3902>
<t3903>Seven prisoners were set free, seven heads were displayed on sharp stakes, the keys to the cursed fortress of eight towers, some letters found, and many other memories of prisoners who had long died from suffering - so many things like that - all echoed in the footsteps of the people of Saint Antoine marching through the streets of Paris in mid-July 1789.</t3903> <t3904>At this moment, may Lucie Darnay's imagination be blocked so that those footsteps stay far from her life! For those are the footsteps of madness, danger; because many years after the day the wine cask broke in front of Defarge's wine shop, those footsteps are not easily washed clean once they are stained with blood.</t3904>
<t3905>22.</t3905> <t3906>The sea still has turbulent waves</t3906>
<t3907>Saint Antoine, gaunt and haggard, had only one victorious week to temporarily soothe the bitter, gnawing crumbs of bread with the sweetness of brotherly embraces and words of praise, while Madame Defarge sat at the wine shop as usual, overseeing the customers.</t3907> <t3908>Madame Defarge did not wear a rose in her hair because, in the short span of the past week, the numerous spies had been extremely reluctant to entrust their lives to the mercy of Saint Antoine.</t3908> <t3909>The street lamps at the intersections in the area named after the saint always swung and swayed on their posts like ominous omens.</t3909>
<t3910>Mrs. Defarge sat with her arms crossed in the hot morning sunlight, silently watching the tavern and the street.</t3910> <t3911>Both inside and outside, many groups of idle people gathered, dirty and miserable individuals whose dire circumstances now granted them a palpable sense of power.</t3911> <t3912>The most tattered nightcaps, askew on the most unfortunate heads, seemed to convey a sinister message: "I know it is increasingly difficult for me, the wearer of this cap, to sustain myself; but do you know that it is becoming easier for me, the wearer of this cap, to destroy your life?"</t3912> <t3913>Every emaciated arm that had long been without work now always had a job ready in raising a fist.</t3913> <t3914>The fingers of the women who had been knitting malevolently for so long knew they could tear flesh and rip skin.</t3914>
<t3915>The appearance of the Saint Antoine district has completely changed; this image has been carved out over hundreds of years, and the final finishing blows have been struck to shape that face.</t3915>
<t3916>Mrs. Defarge sat observing the neighborhood with a satisfied look, carefully concealed to fit her role as the leader of the Saint Antoine women's group.</t3916> <t3917>A sister sat knitting beside her.</t3917> <t3918>She was the short, rather plump wife of the starving grocer, and also the mother of two children. This deputy leader was praised with the nickname Goddess of Vengeance.</t3918>
<t3919>− Look! - said the Goddess of Vengeance. - Listen! Is someone coming? Like a trail of gunpowder suddenly ignited from the outer edge of the Saint Antoine district stretching to the tavern door, there was a growing murmur approaching faster and faster.</t3919>
<t3920>− That's Defarge, - she said.</t3920> <t3921>- Silence, patriots!</t3921> <t3922>Defarge ran in, panting, pulled off the red cap from his head, and looked around.</t3922>
<t3923>− Listen, everyone! - Her voice again. - Listen to what he has to say!</t3923> <t3924>Defarge stood panting, with eager eyes and gaping mouths behind him at the door; everyone in the tavern stood up abruptly. - Speak, my dear.</t3924> <t3925>What's the matter? −</t3925> <t3926>News from the dead! − How can that be? - She exclaimed, her voice scornful.</t3926> <t3927>- The dead? −</t3927> <t3928>Does anyone here still remember old Foulon*, the one who told the starving people to eat grass to fill their bellies, and who has already gone to the underworld? − Remember! - Every throat shouted.</t3928>
<t3929>− There is news about the old man.</t3929> <t3930>The old man is right here! −</t3930> <t3931>Right here! - Those throats shouted in unison again.</t3931> <t3932>- And dead? −</t3932> <t3933>Not dead yet! He's so scared of us... and rightly so... so scared that he had to pretend to be dead and staged a fake funeral.</t3933> <t3934>But people found out he was still alive, hiding in the countryside, and brought him back here.</t3934> <t3935>I just saw him, the criminal, being escorted to the City Hall.</t3935>
<t3936>I said that this old man is afraid of us, and that's true.</t3936> <t3937>Everyone, speak up! Isn't that right?</t3937> <t3938>If that unfortunate old criminal, over seventy years old, had never known this before, he would now remember it deeply if he heard the unanimous shout of everyone's response.</t3938>
<t3939>A moment of profound silence followed.</t3939> <t3940>Defarge and his wife looked straight at each other.</t3940> <t3941>The Goddess of Retribution bent down, and a sound like a loud drum was the noise of her feet stomping hard behind the wine counter.</t3941>
<t3942>− O patriots! - Defarge shouted resolutely.</t3942> <t3943>Ready? Immediately, Madame Defarge's knife was tucked into her back; the footsteps thundered on the road as if some magic had granted the crowd a drummer to accompany them; the Goddess of Vengeance screamed a terrifying cry, raising both hands above her head as if summoning all forty avenging deities at once, running from house to house inciting the women.</t3943>
<t3944>The terrifying men, their hearts boiling with rage, stood in the windows looking out, grabbing any weapon they could find, and rushed out into the streets; but it was the women who presented a sight that made even the bravest shudder.</t3944> <t3945>Leaving behind the remnants of their household chores in poverty, leaving behind their young children, the elderly, and the sick, who were crawling in hunger on the bare ground, the women let their hair down and ran out, urging each other and themselves to join the frenzy with the wildest screams and actions.</t3945> <t3946>The thug Foulon has been caught, sisters! Foulon has been caught, mother! The scoundrel Foulon has been caught, daughters! Then dozens and dozens of women ran into the crowd, beating their chests, tearing their hair, screaming, Foulon is still alive! Foulon told the starving to eat grass! Foulon told my old father to eat grass when I had no bread left for him! Foulon told my nursing infant to eat grass when my breasts had dried up and had no milk for my child! Oh Mother Mary, this name Foulon!</t3946> <t3947>Oh God, why is this suffering so great!</t3947> <t3948>Hear me, oh my dead child!</t3948> <t3949>Hear me, oh my withered old father!</t3949> <t3950>I kneel on these stones and swear to kill Foulon to avenge you, my child, my father! Husband, brother, give me Foulon's blood to drink! Cut off Foulon's head for me! Tear out Foulon's heart for me! Give me Foulon's body and soul! Dismember Foulon, bury him so that grass will grow green on his grave!</t3950> <t3951>Screaming like this, waves of women driven to blind madness, kept spinning, hitting, and tearing at each other until they collapsed unconscious from the frenzy, only to be saved from being trampled by their husbands, fathers, and brothers.</t3951>
<t3952>However, the group did not delay at all; not for a single moment! This Fouton guy is at City Hall and could escape.</t3952>
<t3953>No way, if the people of Saint Antoine knew all the suffering, humiliation, and wrongs they had to endure! A group of men and women, armed, quickly surged out of this area, with a powerful force sweeping everyone along, rushing so fast that within fifteen minutes, there was no one left in the heart of Saint Antoine except for a few elderly and crying children.</t3953>
<t3954>No.</t3954> <t3955>By that time, everyone had crowded into the City Hall, now turned into the Court of Justice - where that vile, evil old man was present - or spilled out into the nearby open spaces and streets.</t3955> <t3956>The Defarges, both husband and wife, the Goddess of Vengeance, and Jacques Three, were among the first to push in, and stood not far from Foulon.</t3956>
<t3957>− Kia! - Mrs. Defarge shouted loudly, raising her knife. - Look at that wicked old man tied up over there.</t3957> <t3958>They've tied a bundle of grass on his back too, how wonderful.</t3958> <t3959>Ha ha! So wonderful.</t3959> <t3960>Make him eat the grass! - She tucked the knife under her arm and clapped her hands as if watching a play.</t3960>
<t3961>The people standing right behind Madame Defarge explained the reason for her satisfaction to those behind them, and these people would explain to others, and so on; thus, the nearby streets also resounded with applause.</t3961> <t3962>For two or three hours straight, along with the word-of-mouth explanations, Madame Defarge's frequently eager expression was quickly mimicked and spread - the image even traveled faster than the words - because many strong and agile people had climbed up the beams outside to look through the windows, they knew Madame Defarge well, and took on the task of conveying her reactions to the crowd outside.</t3962>
<t3963>The sun had finally risen high enough to shine directly down on the old criminal's head like a ray of hope or protection. That grace was too much; in a flash, the long-standing rickety and dusty fence that had not yet fallen, now flew away - the people of Saint Antoine rushed in to seize the prisoner.</t3963>
<t3964>Even from the farthest corner of the crowd, everyone knew immediately what was happening.</t3964>
<t3965>Defarge jumped over a fence and a table, tightly gripping the wretched unfortunate in a deadly embrace - Madame Defarge, closely following her husband, immediately seized the rope binding the prisoner - The Goddess of Vengeance and Jacques Three had not yet arrived, the crowd clinging to the windows like perched birds had not yet managed to get inside - when it seemed as if the entire city echoed with the shout: "Bring him out! Bring him to the lamppost!".</t3965>
<t3966>Falling down, being pulled up, head hitting the steps of the City Hall; then, kneeling; then, standing up; then, falling backward; being dragged, punched, kicked, suffocating from the handfuls of grass and straw thrust into the face by hundreds of hands; clothes torn, flesh bruised, suffocating, bleeding, but never ceasing to plead, begging for mercy; then struggling fiercely in agony with the cramped space as crowds jostled to get a closer look; then like a dead log being dragged through a forest of human legs; the criminal was dragged to the nearest street corner where a fateful street lamp hung, and there Madame Defarge released him - like a cat playing with a mouse - then silently, coldly watched the victim while everyone prepared.</t3966> <t3967>And while the prisoner begged her, the women continuously screamed and shouted at him in a frenzy, the men aggressively demanded to stuff grass into his mouth and then kill him.</t3967> <t3968>The first time, the rope broke when he was hanged, the crowd caught him as he screamed falling down; the second time, the rope broke again, the crowd caught him as he screamed falling down; and by the third time, the rope mercifully held tight, and soon after his head was displayed on a pike, grass stuffed in his mouth for all of Saint Antoine to see and celebrate with dancing and cheering.</t3968>
<t3969>The brutal work of that day was not yet over, for the people of Saint Antoine, shouting, dancing with blood-boiling hatred, and seething with resentment once more at the end of the day upon hearing the news that the son-in-law of the one who had been killed - another enemy and offender of the people - was coming to Paris with five hundred troops, all cavalry.</t3969> <t3970>The people of Saint Antoine recorded this man's crimes on fluttering pieces of paper, then captured him alive - surely they must have attacked the entire army to capture him and make him share Foulon's fate - beheading him and displaying his heart on a sharp stake, and the entire wolf-like crowd paraded all three trophies through the streets.</t3970>
<t3971>It wasn't until late at night that the group of men and women returned to their crying, hungry children.</t3971> <t3972>Thus, the miserable bakeries were once again surrounded by long lines of people, patiently waiting to buy moldy loaves of bread; while waiting with their empty, shrunken stomachs, they passed the time by embracing each other to celebrate their recent achievements and reminiscing about the day's events.</t3972> <t3973>Gradually, the ragged lines of people shortened and thinned out, then dim lights began to shine in the high windows, and flickering fires were kindled on the streets, with neighboring households gathering to cook together, and afterward, they sat right on the doorsteps, slurping their soup.</t3973>
<t3974>The dinner was lacking, meager, without meat and also without any sauce for the miserable piece of bread.</t3974> <t3975>But friendship had mixed in a bit of nourishing flavor into the dry food, sparking a little cheerful smile.</t3975> <t3976>The fathers and mothers who had spent the whole day engaged in those dreadful tasks were now gently playing with their emaciated children; and the lovers - amidst the awaiting world - loved each other and hoped for tomorrow.</t3976>
<t3977>Near dawn, when Defarge's tavern bid farewell to its last guests, Mr. Defarge said to his wife in a hoarse voice while closing the doors: −</t3977> <t3978>At last, the day has come, my dear! −</t3978> <t3979>Indeed! - She replied. - It's coming soon.</t3979>
<t3980>Saint Antoine sleeps; the Defarges sleep; even the Goddess of Vengeance sleeps beside her starved husband, and the drum has fallen silent.</t3980> <t3981>That drumbeat is the only sound in Saint Antoine that bloodshed and falling heads do not alter.</t3981> <t3982>The Goddess of Vengeance, the guardian of that battle drum, may awaken and once again sound the drum to rally everyone as before the fall of the Bastille, or before old Foulon was seized; but the hoarse voices of all the men and women in the heart of Saint Antoine have been changed forever.</t3982>
<t3983>23.</t3983> <t3984>Catch fire</t3984>
<t3985>It is no longer the same in the village with the fountain, where the road worker goes out daily to the main road to pound stones to earn enough pieces of bread to keep his poor, deluded soul from leaving his emaciated, wretched body.</t3985> <t3986>The prison on the cliff is also not as formidable as before; there are still guards but not many; there are still officers commanding those guards but no one knows what their troops are capable of - only that these troops are very likely not to follow orders.</t3986>
<t3987>Everywhere is a desolate countryside, with nothing but a bleak scene.</t3987> <t3988>Each green leaf, each blade of grass, each stalk of rice is withered pitifully like these impoverished people.</t3988> <t3989>Everything is bent, forlorn, stifling, and hopeless.</t3989> <t3990>Houses, fences, livestock, men, women, children, and even the land that sustains them - all are exhausted.</t3990>
<t3991>The blessing of the nation lies in the high-ranking officials (considered individually, often the most elite nobles), who create a sense of chivalry in everything, are the elegant epitome of a lavish and luxurious life, and bring so much meaning to similar matters.</t3991> <t3992>However, it is these high-ranking officials who, in one way or another, have caused this situation.</t3992> <t3993>Strangely enough, the world that seemed reserved for the high officials has been drained and exhausted so quickly! There must be some shortsightedness in the way things are permanently arranged!</t3993> <t3994>But it is true, and when even the hardest stone has been drained to the last drop of blood, when the torture device has been turned to its final notch and any further tightening would strip the screw, when no more pressure can be applied, the high officials begin to flee from this dreadful and incomprehensible disaster.</t3994>
<t3995>But that is not the change in this village, and many villages like it.</t3995> <t3996>For decades, high-ranking officials have drained this place dry but rarely showed their faces unless excited to hunt - sometimes hunting people, sometimes hunting animals, and turning barren, savage lands into exclusive hunting grounds for themselves.</t3996> <t3997>No, the change lies in the unfamiliar faces of the common folk appearing, not in the refined, elegant appearances of the high-ranking, influential people who are disappearing.</t3997>
<t3998>Therefore, at that time, when working alone in the dust, the road laborer rarely thought about his dusty fate of returning to dust, but mainly focused on how many meals he could earn and, if possible, how many meals he could eat. At that time, when he lifted his eyes from his solitary work and looked into the distance, he often saw a rustic figure walking closer, a type of traveler once rarely seen in this area but now increasingly common.</t3998> <t3999>As the figure became clearer, the road laborer would recognize without much surprise that it was a person with disheveled hair, a somewhat savage face, tall and large, wearing crude wooden shoes that even the road laborer found clumsy, with an aggressive, rough, dark appearance, covered in dust from miles of travel, soaked in mud from swampy lands, and covered in thorns, moss, and grass from cutting through forest shortcuts.</t3999>
<t4000>A figure like that appeared like a ghost at midday in July when the road worker sat on a pile of stones under an embankment, trying to avoid a sudden hailstorm that had just poured down.</t4000>
<t4001>The other man looked at him, looked down at the village in the valley, looked at the mill, then looked at the prison on the cliff.</t4001> <t4002>After identifying those targets in his dark mind, he finally spoke in an almost incomprehensible dialect: −</t4002> <t4003>How's the situation, Jacques? −</t4003> <t4004>All good, Jacques.</t4004>
<t4005>− Understood! The two shook hands, and he sat down on the pile of rocks.</t4005>
<t4006>− Not having lunch? −</t4006> <t4007>Now we only have dinner, - the road worker said, his face showing signs of hunger.</t4007>
<t4008>− It's the same everywhere, - the other person grumbled. - Everywhere you go, you see people skipping lunch.</t4008>
<t4009>He took out a darkened pipe, packed it with tobacco, lit it with flint and steel, and puffed away until the tobacco glowed red; then he removed the pipe from his mouth, pinched some powder between his thumb and forefinger, dropped it into the pipe, which flared up and then went out, leaving a wisp of smoke.</t4009>
<t4010>− Understood! - Now it's the turn of the road worker to speak after observing that action.</t4010> <t4011>The two shook hands again.</t4011>
<t4012>− Tonight? - The road official asked.</t4012>
<t4013>− Tonight? - The traveler said as he brought the pipe to his lips.</t4013>
<t4014>− Where? − Here.</t4014>
<t4015>He and the road worker sat silently on the pile of stones, looking at each other while the hail shot into the space between them with drops as sharp as bayonet stabs, until the sky over the village began to clear.</t4015>
<t4016>− Show me the way! - The traveler said and then went up the hill.</t4016>
<t4017>− There! - The road worker replied, extending a finger.</t4017> <t4018>- You go down here, cross the road, past the water fountain...</t4018>
<t4019>− Get rid of that crap! - The other person interrupted, glancing around the scene.</t4019> <t4020>- I'm not going through any roads or fountains.</t4020> <t4021>What? − Fine! Then about two miles over the hill behind the village.</t4021>
<t4022>− Good.</t4022> <t4023>When will you be done? −</t4023> <t4024>At sunset.</t4024>
<t4025>− Before you leave, wake me up, okay?</t4025> <t4026>I've been walking for two days without rest.</t4026> <t4027>Let me finish this pipe, then I'll sleep soundly.</t4027> <t4028>Remember to wake me up.</t4028>
<t4029>− Certainly.</t4029>
<t4030>The traveler finished his pipe, put it away in his chest, took off his bulky wooden shoes, and then lay down on the pile of rocks.</t4030> <t4031>He fell asleep immediately.</t4031>
<t4032>While the road worker diligently carried on with his dusty task, the dark clouds gradually dispersed, revealing patches of sky through which silver sunlight pierced, casting long streaks of light on the scenery below. The short road worker (now wearing a red hat instead of a green one) seemed to be drawn to the figure lying on the pile of stones.</t4032> <t4033>He kept glancing in that direction, working mechanically and, I must say, perfunctorily.</t4033> <t4034>As for the traveler - with a sunburned face, a tangled mess of black hair and beard, a coarse red woolen hat, a ragged assortment of self-woven fabrics and furry animal hides, a strong frame diminished by hunger, lips tightly pressed in despair and irritation even in sleep - he inspired awe in the road worker.</t4034> <t4035>The traveler had journeyed countless miles, his feet swollen, ankles blistered and bleeding, his cumbersome shoes stuffed with grass and leaves were too heavy to drag along the long road, his clothes tattered and full of holes, and his body covered in sores.</t4035> <t4036>Hunched beside him, the road worker tried to see if there were any hidden weapons on the traveler; but it was in vain, as the man slept with his arms tightly crossed on his chest, as resolute as his tightly pressed lips.</t4036> <t4037>Fortresses with high walls, deep moats, watchtowers, barred gates, and drawbridges seemed meaningless to the road worker as he gazed at this sleeping figure.</t4037>
<t4038>And when he looked up at the horizon, in his mind he envisioned similar figures, unstoppable, converging on the cities across France.</t4038>
<t4039>The other person was still sleeping, indifferent to the alternating sunshine and rain, to the light and darkness taking turns to cover his face, to the opaque hailstones scattering all over his body, which sparkled like diamonds when the sun shone on them, sleeping until the sun descended in the western sky and the entire sky turned crimson.</t4039> <t4040>At that moment, the road worker had finished arranging his tools and everything else, preparing to return to the village, and then woke the other person up.</t4040>
<t4041>− Good! - The traveler propped himself up on his elbow. - Two miles over the hilltop past the village? −</t4041> <t4042>Around that.</t4042>
<t4043>− About that.</t4043> <t4044>Good!</t4044> <t4045>The road worker walked back, the dust in front of him swirling in the wind, and soon he reached the water fountain, mingling with the herd of emaciated cows being led to drink, and it seemed as if he was whispering secrets to both the village and the cows.</t4045> <t4046>When the villagers had finished their meager dinner, they did not climb into bed as usual but instead sat stubbornly in front of their houses.</t4046> <t4047>The peculiar habit of whispering into each other's ears had infected the entire village, and when they gathered around the fountain in the darkness, they adopted another strange habit of staring in one direction, waiting for something in the sky.</t4047>
<t4048>Mr. Gabelle, the station commander here, became anxious; he also went up to the roof alone to look in that direction, then looked down at the dark faces behind the chimney below and sent word to the church keyholder that they might need to ring the alarm bell soon.</t4048>
<t4049>The night thickened.</t4049> <t4050>The rows of trees surrounding the ancient castle, isolating the building, swayed with the rising wind as if they were threatening the massive dark structure in the darkness.</t4050> <t4051>The rain lashed madly against the two staircases leading up to the corridor, pounding on the large main door, thundering as if a messenger was urgently alerting those inside; fierce gusts of wind slipped into the great hall, howling through the old spears and hunting knives, then moaned up the stairs, shaking the curtains covering the bed where the last Marquis had lain asleep.</t4051> <t4052>From the four directions—east, west, south, and north—through the forest, four disheveled figures, their steps crushing tall grass and breaking fallen branches, cautiously advanced to the rendezvous point in the castle courtyard.</t4052> <t4053>From there, four flames flared up and then moved in different directions, and the surroundings returned to darkness as before.</t4053>
<t4054>But not long after.</t4054> <t4055>Soon after that, the castle began to take shape in a strange way with a self-emitting light, as if it were gradually radiating a halo.</t4055> <t4056>Then a flickering light appeared behind the facade, glimmering in the gaps, casting shadows on the positions of the balcony columns, arches, and windows.</t4056> <t4057>Then the light grew higher, wider, and more dazzling.</t4057> <t4058>In the blink of an eye, from twenty large windows, flames burst out and the stone faces awakened, glaring out from within the blaze.</t4058>
<t4059>Around the castle echoed the murmurs of a few people still living there, and the sound of horses being saddled and then galloping swiftly.</t4059> <t4060>The sound of spurs and whips cutting through the night, then the reins being pulled sharply at the open ground by the fountain in the village, and the foaming horse stopped in front of Mr. Gabelle's house.</t4060> <t4061>"Help, Gabelle! Help, everyone!" The urgent alarm bells rang out, but no one came to assist.</t4061> <t4062>The road worker and his two hundred and fifty friends just stood with their arms crossed at the fountain, watching the column of fire blaze against the sky.</t4062> <t4063>"The fire must be at least fifteen meters high," they cruelly told each other, and remained in place.</t4063>
<t4064>The knight from the castle and the foaming horse clattered through the village and then galloped up the rocky slope to the prison on the cliff.</t4064> <t4065>At the gate, a group of officers were watching the fire, a short distance away was a group of soldiers.</t4065>
<t4066>“Help, officers...!”</t4066> <t4067>“The castle is on fire; if you arrive in time, you can save many valuable items from burning! Help, help!” The officers looked towards the soldiers who were watching the fire, without giving any orders; they just shrugged, bit their lips, and responded: “It has to burn.” As the horse rider clattered down the hill and crossed the road, the whole village was ablaze.</t4067> <t4068>The road worker and his two hundred and fifty companions, excited by the fire, unanimously rushed home to light candles in every frosted window.</t4068> <t4069>Shortages were common, so the villagers had to force Mr. Gabelle to lend them some candles; and while this official was still reluctant and hesitant, the road worker, who usually cowered before authority, now spoke up, saying that if they set Gabelle’s carriages on fire, they would burn brightly and roast the relay station horses.</t4069>
<t4070>The castle was left to burn to ashes.</t4070> <t4071>Amidst the roaring flames, a fierce red gust blew from within as if trying to sweep away the building.</t4071> <t4072>In the flickering and blazing firelight, the stone faces looked as if they were being tortured.</t4072> <t4073>As the massive stones and beams collapsed, the face with two indentations on its nose was buried and then immediately reappeared through the smoke, resembling the face of the cruel Marquis being burned at the stake and writhing in the flames.</t4073>
<t4074>The castle was blazing; the nearest trees were scorched and shriveled; the distant trees were set on fire by the four fierce figures, enveloping the burning building in a newly formed dense forest of smoke.</t4074> <t4075>Lead and molten iron bubbled furiously in the granite basin of the fountain; the water had dried up; the candle-shaped spires had melted like ice under the heat of the fire and flowed down in four turbulent streams of fire.</t4075>
<t4076>The solid stone walls cracked, splitting into many large grooves as if crystallizing; the dizzy birds kept flying around and then fell into the fire; four fierce figures trudged away in four directions: south, north, east, and west, enveloped in darkness, their torches lighting the way to the next destination.</t4076> <t4077>Under the brightly lit village, the people had expelled the church elder and replaced the alarm bell with a series of joyful chimes.</t4077>
<t4078>Not only that.</t4078> <t4079>Intoxicated by hunger, fire, and the sound of bells, the villagers began to think that Mr. Gabelle must be involved in the matter of tax collection, even though Gabelle had only been collecting small taxes in recent days and had not collected any land rent; thus, they impatiently demanded an explanation, gathering to surround the station and insisting that this official come out to speak with them directly.</t4079>
<t4080>Meanwhile, Mr. Gabelle had bolted the door and retreated inside to question himself.</t4080> <t4081>The result of that self-conversation was that Gabelle once again went up to the roof, standing behind the cluster of chimneys; this time he was determined (being a small-built man from the South, with a combative nature) that if the villagers broke in, he would throw himself over the edge of the roof and jump into the crowd, crushing a few people below.</t4081>
<t4082>Perhaps Mr. Gabelle had spent a long night on the rooftop, with the distant castle as a lantern, and the sound of knocking along with the jubilant church bells as music; not to mention the ominous lantern swaying across the street in front of the post station gate where the excited villagers wanted to hang him instead.</t4082> <t4083>A perilous and tense situation when having to spend the entire summer night on that dark brink, ready to plunge into the sea of people as Mr. Gabelle had resolved!</t4083> <t4084>But the friendly dawn finally arrived, the village candles had burned out, the people cheerfully dispersed, and Mr. Gabelle descended from the rooftop, temporarily preserving his life.</t4084>
<t4085>Within a hundred miles, in the light of the fires of other blazes that night and many more nights, there were officials less fortunate when the sun rose to witness their bodies hanging on the once peaceful streets where they had grown up.</t4085> <t4086>And there were also villagers and townsfolk less fortunate than the road worker and his village friends, when the authorities and soldiers reversed the situation and it was their turn to hang civilians.</t4086> <t4087>But those fierce figures still steadily moved in all four directions—east, west, south, north—marching regardless of the circumstances; and no matter who was hanged, the fires still burned.</t4087> <t4088>How high must the gallows be to stop those flames?</t4088> <t4089>No matter how many calculations were made, no official could find the answer.</t4089>
<t4090>24. Magnet Mountain</t4090>
<t4091>Three years of devastating storms have passed, waves of blazing fire and fierce currents, the solid ground trembling under the hurried steps of an unrelenting ocean that only ever surged, growing more ferocious with each moment, to the horror and astonishment of those witnessing from the shore.</t4091> <t4092>Three more of little Lucie's birthdays have been woven with golden threads into the fabric of peace of the home.</t4092>
<t4093>For days and nights, the members of that family listened to the echoes on the street corner, their hearts nearly stopping at the sound of the numerous, hurried footsteps.</t4093> <t4094>Because in their minds, those footsteps were the steps of a nation, bustling under the red flag, and when that country declared a state of emergency, the dreadful, long-lasting spell turned everyone into a pack of wild beasts.</t4094>
<t4095>The aristocracy, as a class, has isolated itself in the face of the public no longer respecting them: hardly anyone wants to see them in France, to the extent that their fate is at risk of being excluded from both that country and this world.</t4095> <t4096>Just like the peasant in the fairy tale who spent so much effort summoning the devil but fled in terror upon seeing its face, not daring to ask the enemy a single question; the aristocracy, after brazenly reciting the Lord's Prayer backwards for so many years*, and using countless powerful spells to lure Satan, were terrified and fled at the sight of the Devil, losing their noble legs in the process.</t4096>
<t4097>The brilliant elite group of the court has disappeared; otherwise, they would have become the target of the national guard's storm of bullets.</t4097> <t4098>These elites have always been an eyesore - they have long been as arrogant as Lucifer*, as extravagant as King Sardanapalus*, and as blind as a mole - but now they have completely vanished.</t4098> <t4099>The court, from the privileged inner circle to the corrupt, scheming, degenerate, and deceitful ones on the fringes, all have gone at once.</t4099> <t4100>The royal family is no more; they have been confined in the palace and "suspended," according to the latest circulating news.</t4100>
<t4101>By August 1792, the high-ranking officials had dispersed in all directions.</t4101>
<t4102>Of course, the headquarters and the meeting place of the high-ranking French officials in London was Tellson's Bank.</t4102> <t4103>It is said that spirits often haunt the places they frequented most in life, and the destitute nobles would haunt the place that once held their wealth.</t4103> <t4104>Moreover, it was the place where news from France arrived the fastest and was the most reliable.</t4104> <t4105>Furthermore, Tellson's was a generous firm, extremely kind to its former clients who had fallen on hard times.</t4105> <t4106>Additionally, the nobles who foresaw the coming storm and feared looting or confiscation had prudently entrusted their money to Tellson's, making it also a place where their impoverished brethren came to inquire.</t4106> <t4107>It must also be mentioned that anyone newly arrived from France would come to Tellson's to report news and describe the situation, almost as a matter of course.</t4107> <t4108>For these reasons, Tellson's at that time resembled a hub for information from France; this was well known and people flocked there in such numbers to seek news that Tellson's often had to write brief notes of the latest news and post them on the bank's window for everyone passing by Temple Bar to read.</t4108>
<t4109>On a foggy afternoon, Mr. Lorry sat by the desk, while Charles Darnay leaned against it, speaking in a low voice.</t4109> <t4110>This confessional room, once reserved for meetings with the Master, had now become an information center, overflowing with news.</t4110> <t4111>There was about half an hour left until closing time.</t4111>
<t4112>− But although no one has ever matched your strength, Charles Darnay said, hesitating slightly, - I must suggest to you that...</t4112>
<t4113>− I understand.</t4113> <t4114>It's because I'm too old, right? - Mr. Lorry said.</t4114>
<t4115>− The weather is unpredictable, the journey is long, the means of travel are uncertain, the country is in chaos, and the capital city might not even be safe for you.</t4115>
<t4116>− Charles, - Mr. Lorry said, in a confident and cheerful voice, - you have pointed out exactly the reasons why I must go, not why I should stay.</t4116>
<t4117>What is there that is not safe; no one would want to mess with an old man nearly eighty when there are many others more worth messing with.</t4117> <t4118>As for the chaos in the capital, if there were no chaotic cities, there would be no occasion for this company to send someone from here to a branch there, someone familiar with the place and the old job, and trusted by Tellson.</t4118>
<t4119>As for the unsafe roads, the long journey, and the winter weather, if we are not ready to accept a few inconveniences for the benefit of Tellson, after all these years, then who else will? −</t4119> <t4120>I wish I could go myself, - Charles Darnay said, somewhat regretfully, like a man thinking out loud.</t4120>
<t4121>− Really! It's surprising that you want to intervene! - Mr. Lorry exclaimed.</t4121>
<t4122>- Do you want to go yourself?</t4122> <t4123>And you are French?</t4123> <t4124>What a wise idea!</t4124> <t4125>Mr. Lorry, it's precisely because I am French that I often have that thought in my head, but I never intended to say it here.</t4125> <t4126>I can't stop myself from having some sympathy for those wretched people, and having given up something for them, - he said again with a contemplative look as before, who knows, they might listen to me, who knows, I might have the ability to persuade them to restrain themselves somewhat.</t4126> <t4127>Just last night, after you left, when I was talking to Lucie...</t4127>
<t4128>− When you were talking to Lucie, - Mr. Lorry repeated. - Right.</t4128> <t4129>I'm surprised you're not ashamed to mention Lucie's name! And you want to go to France at this very moment too! −</t4129> <t4130>But I won't go, - Charles Darnay smiled. - It is precisely for the reasons you mentioned that you must go.</t4130>
<t4131>− And obviously, we will go.</t4131> <t4132>Charles, the truth is, - Mr. Lorry glanced towards the Boss in the distance, then lowered his voice, - you can't imagine the difficulties in the firm's transactions and the risks related to the documents over there.</t4132> <t4133>Only God above knows what damage might befall many people if some of those documents were confiscated or destroyed; and it could happen at any time, you know, because who can say that Paris won't be set on fire today, or looted tomorrow!</t4133> <t4134>So, if someone has to rush over there to carefully select those documents, bury them or store them in a safe place, only I am capable of doing it, and it must be done urgently.</t4134> <t4135>Can I delay just because of a bit of stiff joints when Tellson knows the situation well and tells me to go; Tellson, whose bread I've eaten for sixty years! Oh, compared to half a dozen old fogeys here, I'm still quite spry, sir!</t4135> <t4136>I truly admire your youthful and courageous spirit, Mr. Lorry.</t4136>
<t4137>− Tsk! Just talking nonsense!... Ah, Charles, - Mr. Lorry said while glancing towards the Master once more, - you must remember that getting anything out of Paris right now, anything at all, is nearly impossible.</t4137> <t4138>Just today, many documents, many valuable things have been brought to this firm; I'm telling you this in confidence because revealing this secret even to you is unprofessional; the people who brought them here are unbelievably strange, they could lose their heads just by stepping through the gates of Paris.</t4138> <t4139>In the past, the firm's parcels moved back and forth to France as easily as in this commercially accustomed England; but now everything is cut off.</t4139>
<t4140>− So, are you really going tonight? −</t4140> <t4141>Yes, I am really going tonight because the situation is too urgent to delay any longer.</t4141>
<t4142>− So you're not taking anyone with you? −</t4142> <t4143>They offered me many people, but I didn't want any of them.</t4143> <t4144>I intend to take Jerry along.</t4144> <t4145>Jerry has long been my guard on Sunday nights, and I have grown accustomed to him.</t4145> <t4146>To everyone else, Jerry is clearly nothing more than a vicious dog, always ready to attack anyone who touches his master.</t4146>
<t4147>− I must say once again that I wholeheartedly admire your brave and valiant spirit.</t4147>
<t4148>− I must say it again, you are speaking nonsense, nonsense! Once I have completed this petty commission, I will probably accept Tellson's retirement proposal and live comfortably.</t4148> <t4149>At that time, there will be plenty of time to reflect on old age.</t4149>
<t4150>The conversation took place at Mr. Lorry's usual desk, just a meter away from the crowd of French aristocrats boasting about soon taking revenge on the unruly commoners.</t4150> <t4151>The aristocrats, who were down on their luck and had to flee abroad, were still accustomed to such habits, no different from the English establishment. They talked about the terrible Revolution as if it were a storm they were reaping without ever having sown the wind—as if they had done nothing at all, or made no mistakes that led to this—as if they had not seen that this was inevitably coming, many years before, and had not clearly recorded what they had witnessed.</t4151> <t4152>(They—those who watched millions of impoverished people in France, saw the resources that should have made the people prosperous but were instead abused and wasted by them.)</t4152> <t4153>Those who were clear-headed and understood the truth could hardly endure such empty words along with the wild schemes of the high officials who wanted to restore a state of affairs that was already completely exhausted, that had already declined to the utmost.</t4153> <t4154>And it was precisely those empty words, along with the anxiety and worry that surged to his head, that made Charles Darnay's mind simmer with persistent discomfort and restlessness.</t4154>
<t4155>Among those speaking was Stryver, a man of the Supreme Court, who was advancing far in his career, and thus very vocal on this topic.</t4155> <t4156>He was plotting for the French aristocrats to annihilate the common people, to sweep them off the face of the earth to be rid of them; along with various plans to achieve similar goals through fantastical and absurd methods akin to reaching for the stars.</t4156> <t4157>Listening to Stryver made Darnay extremely annoyed, and he was hesitating whether to leave to avoid the irritation or to stay and contribute a few words when an event occurred that determined his choice.</t4157>
<t4158>The Boss went to Mr. Lorry, placed an unopened letter in front of him, and asked if he knew anything about the whereabouts of the recipient named on the address.</t4158> <t4159>The Boss placed the letter close enough to where Darnay was standing that he could see the message - and immediately took notice because it was his name.</t4159> <t4160>The address, translated into English, was: “Urgent.</t4160> <t4161>To the former Marquis St.</t4161>
<t4162>Evrémonde, France.</t4162> <t4163>Forwarded through Tellson & Co. Bank, London, England.</t4163>
<t4164>On the morning of the wedding years ago, Dr. Manette had earnestly requested Charles Darnay that this secret identity be known only to the two of them unless the doctor himself annulled the agreement.</t4164> <t4165>No one else knew that it was his name; not even his wife had the slightest idea; and Mr. Lorry even less so.</t4165>
<t4166>− No, - Mr. Lorry answered his employer, - I think I have asked everyone present here, and no one knows anything about the whereabouts of this gentleman.</t4166>
<t4167>The clock hands were nearing the bank's closing hour, a group of people chatting as they passed by Mr. Lorry's desk.</t4167> <t4168>He held out the letter to inquire; then one official after another looked at it with the expression of a distressed and scheming refugee, followed by another high-ranking official who looked at it with the expression of a scheming and distressed exile; then Mr. This, Mr. That, Mr. Other, all said something disparaging, in either French or English, about the missing Marquis.</t4168>
<t4169>− I think this is the nephew... but anyway, he is the degenerate heir... of the noble Marquis who was assassinated, - one person said.</t4169> <t4170>To be honest, I'm glad, I don't know this guy.</t4170>
<t4171>− A coward who gave up his position years ago, - another person said, this high-ranking official fled from Paris, head tucked between his legs, burrowing to suffocate in a pile of straw.</t4171>
<t4172>"− Influenced by new doctrines," the third person said while glancing at the address line as he walked by, "he voluntarily confronted the late Marquis, abandoned the inheritance he was entitled to, and left everything to those ruffians."</t4172> <t4173>"They will now repay the favor, I hope, because he deserves it."</t4173>
<t4174>− What? - Stryver's voice boomed arrogantly.</t4174> <t4175>- Did he really do that? Is he that kind of person?</t4175> <t4176>Let's take a look at his disgrace.</t4176> <t4177>The bastard!</t4177> <t4178>Unable to bear it any longer, Darnay gently patted Stryver on the shoulder and said: −</t4178> <t4179>I know this man.</t4179>
<t4180>− Oh my, dear God? - Stryver said.</t4180> <t4181>- I feel sorry for you.</t4181>
<t4182>− The reason? −</t4182> <t4183>The reason, Darnay? Have you heard about the things he's done?</t4183> <t4184>Don't ask for reasons in these times.</t4184>
<t4185>− But I want to ask for that reason? −</t4185> <t4186>Then I will say it again, Mr. Darnay, I feel sorry for you.</t4186>
<t4187>I regret hearing you raise such strange questions.</t4187> <t4188>This is a person who has been infected with the most harmful and blasphemous rules ever, who has given up their property to the most despicable scum of the earth who only know how to commit mass murder, yet you still ask why I regret that a teacher of children like you knows such a person?</t4188> <t4189>Alright, I will tell you.</t4189> <t4190>I regret it because I believe that such scoundrels also spread their infection widely.</t4190> <t4191>That is the reason.</t4191>
<t4192>Remembering the secret, Darnay tried his best to stay calm, he said: "Perhaps you do not know this gentleman."</t4192>
<t4193>− But I know how to corner you, Mr. Darnay, Stryver said in a bullying tone, - and I will do just that.</t4193> <t4194>And if that person is indeed a gentleman, then I do not know him.</t4194> <t4195>You can tell him that, along with my regards.</t4195> <t4196>You can also tell him that, I say this myself, after having given up wealth and status to that crowd of butchers, I don't understand why he doesn't just lead them.</t4196> <t4197>But no, gentlemen, - Stryver said while looking around and snapping his fingers, - I know a little about human nature, and I tell you that you will never see someone like him entrust himself to the mercy of such a precious group of disciples.</t4197> <t4198>No, gentlemen, he will always run for his life at the first sign of trouble, and disappear.</t4198>
<t4199>Finishing his words and snapping his fingers one last time, Stryver stormed out onto Fleet Street to the applause of the crowd gathered around him.</t4199> <t4200>At the desk, only Lorry and Charles Darnay remained as everyone else left the bank.</t4200>
<t4201>− Will you take care of this letter? - Mr. Lorry said.</t4201> <t4202>- Do you know where to deliver it? −</t4202> <t4203>I know.</t4203>
<t4204>− So please explain that the letter was sent to this address because it was thought that we would know who to forward it to, and that the letter has been here for quite a while, okay? −</t4204> <t4205>I will say that.</t4205> <t4206>Are you leaving for Paris from here directly? −</t4206> <t4207>From here, at eight o'clock.</t4207>
<t4208>− I will come back to see you off.</t4208>
<t4209>Very frustrated with himself, with Stryver, and with others, Darnay tried to find a quiet place in the Temple Bar area, opened the letter, and read it.</t4209>
<t4210>Letter written: Abbaye Prison, Paris, June 21, 1792 TO THE FORMER MARQUIS After a long period of life-threatening danger at the hands of the villagers, I was forcibly and humiliatingly captured, and had to walk a long distance to Paris.</t4210> <t4211>On the way, I endured countless hardships.</t4211>
<t4212>But that's not all; the tiles of my house have been destroyed - leveled to the ground.</t4212>
<t4213>The crime for which I am imprisoned, dear Marquis, and for which I will be tried and lose my life (without your noble assistance), is the crime of treason against the glorious people, they say, by acting on behalf of an exile against them.</t4213> <t4214>I have wasted my efforts trying to convince them that I was helping them and not acting against them, in accordance with your orders.</t4214>
<t4215>I wasted my efforts trying to convince them that, before confiscating the property of the exiled person, I had paid all the taxes they had not paid; that I did not collect any rent; that I did not pursue any debts.</t4215> <t4216>They still insisted that I was acting on behalf of an exiled person and were determined to know where that exiled person was.</t4216>
<t4217>Oh! Dear kind sirs, formerly the Marquis, where is that exiled person? I weep in my sleep asking where they are?</t4217> <t4218>I ask the heavens if that person will come to rescue me?</t4218> <t4219>There is no answer.</t4219> <t4220>Oh dear sirs, formerly the Marquis, I send my forlorn cries across the sea, hoping they might reach your ears through the renowned and prestigious Tilson* bank in Paris! For the love of God, justice, generosity, and the honor of your noble lineage, I earnestly beg you, dear sirs, formerly the Marquis, to help and liberate me.</t4220> <t4221>My fault is my loyalty to you.</t4221> <t4222>Oh dear sirs, formerly the Marquis, I pray you do not forsake me.</t4222>
<t4223>From this dreadful prison, where with each passing hour I draw closer to death, I send to you, my lord who was once a Marquis, my sorrowful and unfortunate loyalty.</t4223>
<t4224>Dearly suffering, GABELLE The letter stirred up the latent discomfort in Darnay's mind fiercely.</t4224> <t4225>An old, kind servant was in peril just because of his loyalty to Darnay and his family, which felt like a severe reprimand to the point where Darnay almost wanted to hide his face from passersby out of shame as he walked around the Temple area, contemplating what to do.</t4225>
<t4226>He knew very well that he had acted negligently in the horror of the events that had pushed the scandal and wicked actions of this ancient family to the extreme, in the suspicion and resentment towards his uncle, in the disgust he felt for the collapsing pillars of the society he should have supported.</t4226> <t4227>He knew very well that it was because of his love for Lucie that he had hastily and carelessly abandoned his social status, even though this intention had been nurtured in his heart for a long time.</t4227> <t4228>He knew that he should have resolved things in proper order and overseen the matter; he had the means to do so but did not follow through.</t4228>
<t4229>He knew very well that, for his own happiness, he chose England as his home, needing a stable job, and the rapid succession of tumultuous events of the times overwhelmed him to the point where last week's tasks were left unfinished and overtaken by this week's, with next week's new tasks already looming; all of this swept him along with the circumstances - it wasn't that Darnay didn't blame himself, but he couldn't resist the relentless and overwhelming tide.</t4229> <t4230>Indeed, he was still waiting for an opportunity to act, but the timing kept shifting and delaying until it was too late; now the nobility were fleeing France on every road, properties were being confiscated and destroyed, even identities were being erased; Darnay himself knew this as well as any new government in France, who might very well punish him.</t4230>
<t4231>But he did not oppress anyone, he did not imprison anyone; he did not even demand to enjoy the privileges corresponding to his status but voluntarily renounced all his titles, stripped himself of all special privileges to plunge into life, find a place for himself, and make a living.</t4231> <t4232>According to the directive written by his own hand, Mr. Gabelle managed that depleted estate, exempting the people from taxes, sharing with them whatever could still be shared - a bit of dry wood in the winter that the usurers could not seize, a few vegetables in the summer that those sharks could not take - and surely Gabelle had mentioned this to plead and prove, for his own safety, which is why this situation has now arisen.</t4232>
<t4233>Thus, the reckless decision that Charles Darnay was considering became even more compelling: he wanted to go to Paris.</t4233>
<t4234>Yes.</t4234> <t4235>Like the sailor in the ancient tale, the waves and winds have driven him into the magnetic field of the Magnetic Mountain, he is being drawn in, and he must go.</t4235>
<t4236>Every thought that appeared in his mind pulled him, faster and faster, more and more surely, towards that terrible gravitational pull.</t4236> <t4237>The long-standing discomfort was precisely the fact that his unfortunate country was being used by bad means to achieve bad ends, something he knew better than anyone: that he himself was not there to try to prevent some of the bloodshed and to call for tolerance and humanity.</t4237>
<t4238>Half suppressed, half reproachful, that discomfort made Darnay bitterly compare himself to the old man of strong will and sense of responsibility at the bank; then immediately after, he bitterly thought of the mocking words of the nobles who had insulted him, the words of Stryver, extremely spiteful and arrogant due to old grudges.</t4238> <t4239>And finally, he thought of Gabelle's letter: an innocent prisoner, on the brink of death, pleading for justice, honor, and his reputation.</t4239>
<t4240>The heart is determined.</t4240> <t4241>He must go to Paris.</t4241>
<t4242>Yes.</t4242> <t4243>The Magnetic Rock Mountain is attracting him, and he must rush towards it, until he faces it head-on.</t4243> <t4244>He does not see the danger; he does not know the risk.</t4244> <t4245>He only thinks about finishing what he has left unfinished, believing that once he returns to France, just presenting that intention will be happily accepted.</t4245> <t4246>Then, in Darnay's mind, appears the glorious prospect of noble deeds, the optimistic illusion often seen in kind-hearted people; he even imagines himself having the power to lead the fierce Revolution that is raging savagely and brutally.</t4246>
<t4247>While coming and going with a determined intention, he resolutely decided not to let either Lucie or her father know about this until the very last moment.</t4247> <t4248>He had to spare Lucie the sorrow of separation; to spare her father from the anxiety and worry, the doctor did not want to remember the dangerous homeland, so when he found out, it would already be done.</t4248> <t4249>His difficult situation was very similar to Dr. Manette's, although he never discussed it with him because he tried to avoid recalling the old connections from the time in France.</t4249> <t4250>But that very situation also influenced Darnay's decision.</t4250>
<t4251>He kept pacing back and forth, busy with his thoughts, until it was time to return to Tellson's Bank to see Mr. Lorry off.</t4251> <t4252>Once in Paris, he would immediately seek out this old friend, but for now, he could not speak of his intentions.</t4252>
<t4253>A stagecoach from the postal station was stationed in front of the bank, and Jerry was all ready.</t4253>
<t4254>− I have delivered that letter, - Charles Darnay said to Mr. Lorry.</t4254> <t4255>I don't want to give you a written response, but surely you can relay it verbally? −</t4255> <t4256>I am willing, - Mr. Lorry said, - if it is not dangerous.</t4256>
<t4257>− Not at all.</t4257> <t4258>Although this message is sent to a prisoner in Abbaye prison.</t4258>
<t4259>− What is that person's name? - Mr. Lorry asked, holding an open notebook.</t4259>
<t4260>− Gabelle.</t4260>
<t4261>− Gabelle.</t4261> <t4262>Any message for the unfortunate prisoner Gabelle? −</t4262> <t4263>Just say "he has received the letter and will come." −</t4263> <t4264>Is there a specific time? −</t4264> <t4265>He will depart tomorrow night.</t4265>
<t4266>− Is there any specific person? −</t4266> <t4267>No.</t4267>
<t4268>He helped Mr. Lorry wrap himself in a bundle of coats and cloaks and, together, they left the warm atmosphere of the old bank, stepping into the foggy streets of Fleet.</t4268>
<t4269>− Send my regards to Lucie and little Lucie, - Mr. Lorry said at parting, - take good care of them until I return. - Charles Darnay shook his head and smiled doubtfully as the carriage rolled away.</t4269>
<t4270>That night - August 14th - he stayed up late, writing two heartfelt letters; one to Lucie explaining the legitimate duty that required him to go to Paris and finally informing her of the reasons he was confident he would not face any danger there; the other to Dr. Manette, entrusting Lucie and their beloved child to his care, and also addressing the aforementioned issues with the strongest conviction.</t4270> <t4271>To both, he wrote that he would send a letter immediately upon arrival to prove he was still safe.</t4271>
<t4272>The next day was a day of suffering, a day spent among loved ones but for the first time, he had something to hide from them in his mind.</t4272> <t4273>It was really hard to maintain a carefree appearance while they had no suspicion that he was deceiving them.</t4273>
<t4274>But just a loving glance towards his wife, who was happy and busy, was enough to make him determined not to reveal what was coming (he had almost decided to tell her, because for him, the feeling of doing something without his wife's silent support was indeed too unfamiliar), and the day passed quickly.</t4274> <t4275>In the evening, he hugged his wife and beloved daughter, pretending that he would return home soon (he excused himself with an appointment and had secretly prepared his belongings), and so he left, immersed in the heavy mist, the heavy streets, and an even heavier heart.</t4275>
<t4276>That invisible attraction is pulling him swiftly towards it, right at this moment, and all the waves and winds are united in pushing him forward.</t4276> <t4277>Darnay had given two letters to a trusted contact to be delivered to the house half an hour after midnight, no sooner; he mounted his horse and set off for Dover to begin his journey.</t4277> <t4278>“For the love of God, for justice, for mercy, and for the honor of your noble family!” The pitiful cry of that poor prisoner had hardened his sorrowful heart, and he left behind all his dearest loved ones to rush towards the Magnetic Rock.</t4278>
<t4279>Part Three GONE WITH THE WIND</t4279>
<t4280>1.</t4280> <t4281>Solitary confinement</t4281>
<t4282>The traveler had to spend a lot of time traversing the distance from England to Paris in the autumn of 1792.</t4282> <t4283>So many bad roads, poor carriages, and exhausted horses were ready to hinder the journey, even though the ill-fated king of France was still reigning gloriously on the throne; but the changing times brought about even more obstacles.</t4283> <t4284>Every city gate and village toll station had groups of patriotic Citizens armed with muskets, ready to fire. They stopped everyone passing by, questioned them, checked their papers, cross-referenced their names with their own lists, sent them back, let them continue, or detained them, depending on their judgment or impulsive decisions, which they believed were best for the nascent United Indivisible Republic of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death.</t4284>
<t4285>Only a few miles into his journey on French soil, Charles Darnay began to realize that there was no hope of returning as long as he had not been recognized as a good Citizen in Paris. Now, whatever might happen, he had to go to the end of the journey.</t4285> <t4286>No sorrowful village had yet slammed its gates on him, no public barricade had blocked the road behind him, but he knew that there was yet another difficult threshold in the long series of obstacles standing between him and England.</t4286> <t4287>Wherever he went, he was closely watched as if he had fallen into a net, or was being transported in a cage to his destination; he could not have imagined that he would lose his freedom so completely.</t4287>
<t4288>The ubiquitous surveillance not only blocked his way on the highway twenty times in one stretch, but also delayed his journey twenty times a day; people rode horses to catch him and make him turn back, rushed ahead to intercept him, rode parallel and guarded him closely.</t4288> <t4289>For several days, he wandered alone in France, and when night fell, he was exhausted on the bed in a small inn by the roadside, with Paris still far away.</t4289>
<t4290>If he had not presented the letter from the miserable Gabelle sent from the Abbaye prison, he would not have been able to get this far.</t4290> <t4291>The guard post of this small town had tormented him so much that he felt this journey had reached a perilous point.</t4291> <t4292>Therefore, he was not surprised to find himself awakened in the middle of the night at the inn where he had rented a room to wait until morning.</t4292>
<t4293>Awakened by a timid local official and three armed patriots wearing tattered red hats, pipes in their mouths, sitting by his bed.</t4293>
<t4294>− Exile, - the official said, - I will send you to Paris, with an escort.</t4294>
<t4295>− Citizen, I want nothing more than to get to Paris, although I think I do not need an escort.</t4295>
<t4296>− Silence! - A red hat shouted while striking the blanket with the butt of a musket.</t4296> <t4297>- Do not argue back, nobleman! −</t4297> <t4298>Just as this Distinguished Citizen said, - the timid official remarked.</t4298> <t4299>You are a nobleman, so you must have an escort... and you must pay for the escort.</t4299>
<t4300>− I have no other choice, - Charles Darnay said.</t4300>
<t4301>− Choice! Listen to him talk! - That same grumpy red hat shouted loudly.</t4301> <t4302>- It's as if saving him from being hanged on the lamppost is taking away his privilege.</t4302>
<t4303>− This patriotic citizen always speaks correctly, - the official said.</t4303> <t4304>Get up and change your clothes, exile.</t4304>
<t4305>Darnay complied and was taken back to the guard post, where other patriots wearing tattered red caps were smoking, drinking, and sleeping by the fire.</t4305> <t4306>Here he had to pay a large sum for the escort, and began to be taken along the muddy roads at three o'clock in the morning.</t4306>
<t4307>The escort group consisted of two patriots wearing red hats adorned with the tricolor emblem, carrying muskets and curved swords, riding horses on either side of Darnay.</t4307>
<t4308>The escorted person rode a horse alone, but a slack rope was tied to his reins, with the other end wrapped around the wrists of the two patriots.</t4308> <t4309>Thus, they set off in the face-stinging rain, the horses clattering like heavy cavalry on the rough cobblestone streets of the town, and proceeded onto the main muddy roads.</t4309> <t4310>In this manner, they sped along the distant roads, only pausing to change horses or adjust their pace, traveling straight through the muddy miles to the capital.</t4310>
<t4311>They traveled all night, stopping only one or two hours after dawn, and rested until dusk.</t4311> <t4312>The two escorts were so poorly dressed that they wrapped straw around their bare feet and covered their ragged shoulders with straw to keep the rain off.</t4312> <t4313>Aside from his personal discomfort at being taken away, and the constant worry about the ever-present danger posed by a perpetually drunken patriot who carelessly wielded a musket, Charles Darnay felt no fear of being treated as a criminal; because he believed that this general situation had nothing to do with his specific case, it would end once he explained his reason for returning to France, which would be confirmed by the prisoner at the Abbaye prison.</t4313>
<t4314>But when they arrived in the city of Beauvais in the afternoon, with the streets crowded, he could not hide his anxiety about the very troubling situation.</t4314>
<t4315>A threatening crowd gathered to watch him dismount at the station yard, and many voices shouted: "Down with the exiles!" Just as he swung his leg over the saddle but before he could step down, he stopped abruptly and continued to sit on the horse for safety, he said: −</t4315> <t4316>Exile, my friends! Don't you see that I am here voluntarily, in this France of ours? −</t4316> <t4317>You are a cursed exile, - a blacksmith shouted angrily as he pushed through the crowd, holding a hammer, - and you are a cursed nobleman! The station master stood between him and Darnay's saddle (clearly the blacksmith's target), then spoke to calm the situation: −</t4317> <t4318>Leave him alone; leave him alone! Paris will judge him.</t4318>
<t4319>− Trial! - The blacksmith repeated while swinging the hammer.</t4319> <t4320>A! And punish him for betrayal.</t4320> <t4321>- Hearing this, the crowd roared in agreement.</t4321>
<t4322>Darnay stopped the head of the station - he was turning his horse's head to pull into the yard (while the drunken patriot sat calmly on his saddle, looking around with the rope wrapped around his wrist) - as soon as the noise subsided, he immediately said: −</t4322> <t4323>Friends, you are mistaken or you do not understand clearly.</t4323> <t4324>I am not a traitor.</t4324>
<t4325>− He's lying! - The other worker shouted. - He has become a traitor since the decree.</t4325> <t4326>His life now belongs to the people.</t4326> <t4327>His cursed life is no longer his! Just as Darnay saw the crowd's eyes boiling with hatred and knew they would soon rush at him, the station master pulled the horse into the yard, with two escorts closely flanking him, and the station master firmly closed and locked the heavy gates.</t4327> <t4328>The blacksmith struck the gate with a hammer, and the crowd grumbled angrily; but that was all.</t4328>
<t4329>− What decree was that workman talking about? - Darnay asked the station master as he stood in the yard next to him and thanked him.</t4329>
<t4330>− That's right, the decree for the liquidation of the exiled person's assets.</t4330>
<t4331>− When was it approved? − On the fourteenth.</t4331>
<t4332>− The day I left England! −</t4332> <t4333>Everyone says that, but it is just one of many decrees; there will be many more decrees... if not already existing ones, decrees that ban exiles from returning and impose the death penalty on those who do.</t4333> <t4334>That's why he said your life is no longer your own.</t4334>
<t4335>− But there hasn't been any such decree yet, right? −</t4335> <t4336>How would I know! - The station master said, shrugging his shoulders.</t4336> <t4337>- There might be, or there certainly will be.</t4337> <t4338>Either way, it's the same.</t4338> <t4339>Which one do you want?</t4339> <t4340>They lay down on the straw mattress in the attic until midnight, then rode on when the whole city was asleep.</t4340> <t4341>One of the most noticeable strange changes that made this journey even more bizarre was that people seemed to sleep very little.</t4341> <t4342>After long, lonely stages of horse hooves on desolate roads, they often encountered a cluster of shabby cottages not shrouded in darkness but brightly lit, and often met many people gathering in the middle of the night like ghosts, hand in hand standing around a withered Liberty Tree, or all gathered together singing a Victory song.</t4342> <t4343>But fortunately, the people of Beauvais were sound asleep that night so they could leave in solitude; the clinking of horse hooves crossed the cold and damp, through the exhausted fields that year no longer yielding crops, dotted with the charred remains of burned houses, and with the sudden ambushes of patriotic patrols monitoring all the roads, cutting across their journey.</t4343>
<t4344>The dawn finally saw them before the gates of Paris. The gates were tightly closed and heavily guarded as they rode up.</t4344>
<t4345>− Where are the papers for this prisoner? - The voice of a stern-looking man who appeared to be the commander, just summoned by the guards.</t4345>
<t4346>Completely taken aback by that unpleasant address, Charles Darnay demanded that the speaker note that he was a free traveler and a French citizen, the country's unrest necessitated an escort, and he had paid for this escort group.</t4346>
<t4347>− Where? - The other character repeated, paying no attention to him.</t4347> <t4348>- Where are this prisoner's papers? Storing the papers in his hat, the drunken patriot pulled them out to present.</t4348> <t4349>Glancing over Gabelle's letter, the authoritative character was slightly confused, surprised, and stared intently at Darnay.</t4349>
<t4350>Without saying a word, he walked straight into the guard post, leaving both the escort and the escorted person sitting on their horses outside the city gate.</t4350> <t4351>While looking around and waiting, Charles Darnay noticed that the place was guarded by a mix of soldiers and patriots, the latter being far more numerous than the former; while entering the capital seemed quite easy for the farmers' produce carts and other vehicles, leaving the place was very difficult, even for the most simple country folk.</t4351> <t4352>A multitude of people, both men and women, not to mention various animals and vehicles, were waiting to pass through the checkpoint; but due to the extremely strict document inspection, the whole crowd moved very slowly through the barrier.</t4352> <t4353>Some people, knowing their turn was far off, lay down on the ground to sleep or smoke, while others chatted or wandered around.</t4353>
<t4354>Everywhere you look, you see the red hat and the tricolor badge, on the heads of both men and women.</t4354>
<t4355>When Darnay had been sitting on his horse for about half an hour, observing the scenery, the authoritative figure from earlier appeared before him again, ordering the guards to open the barricade.</t4355> <t4356>He then handed a receipt to the two escorts, one drunk and one sober, and requested Darnay to dismount.</t4356> <t4357>He complied, and the two patriots led his weary horse away, turning their backs and speeding off without entering the capital.</t4357>
<t4358>He followed that guide into the guard station reeking of cheap alcohol and cigarettes, where it was full of soldiers and patriots, some lying down, some sitting, some asleep, some awake, some drunk, some sober, and in every state between waking and sleeping, between sobriety and drunkenness.</t4358> <t4359>The light in the guard station, partly cast from oil lamps lit since the night and partly from the dim daylight, continuously flickered and swayed.</t4359> <t4360>A pile of books lay open on the desk, and a dark-skinned, coarse officer was presiding over the table.</t4360>
<t4361>− Citizen Defarge, - he said to the person who brought Darnay in, while taking out a piece of paper to make a note. - Is this the exiled Evrémonde? −</t4361> <t4362>This is the one.</t4362>
<t4363>− How old are you, Evrémonde? −</t4363> <t4364>Thirty-seven.</t4364>
<t4365>− Do you have a family, Evrémonde? − Yes, I do.</t4365>
<t4366>− Where did you get married? − In the United Kingdom.</t4366>
<t4367>− Certainly.</t4367> <t4368>Where is your wife, Evrémonde? − In England.</t4368>
<t4369>− Surely so.</t4369> <t4370>Evrémonde, you are consigned to La Force prison.</t4370>
<t4371>− My God! - exclaimed Darnay. - By what law, and for what crime? The officer looked up from the paper for a moment.</t4371>
<t4372>− We have had many new laws, Evrémonde, and many new crimes, since the last time you were here.</t4372> <t4373>- He said with a malicious smile, then continued writing.</t4373>
<t4374>− I ask you to note that I have come here voluntarily, in response to the request of a compatriot written in the letter that is lying before you.</t4374>
<t4375>I just want to have the opportunity to fulfill that request without delay.</t4375> <t4376>Don't I have that right? −</t4376> <t4377>An exile has no rights at all, Evrémonde, - came the indifferent reply.</t4377> <t4378>The officer wrote until he was finished, read over what he had written, sprinkled sand to dry the ink, and then handed the paper to Defarge with a word: “Solitary confinement.”</t4378> <t4379>Defarge waved the paper to signal the prisoner to go with him.</t4379> <t4380>The prisoner obeyed, and two armed patriotic Citizens escorted him.</t4380>
<t4381>− Is it true that you...</t4381> <t4382>- Defarge asked in a lowered voice as they descended the guardhouse steps and entered Paris, - ...are the husband of Dr. Manette's daughter, who was once a prisoner in the Bastille? −</t4382> <t4383>Yes, - Darnay replied, looking at the questioner with surprise.</t4383>
<t4384>− I am Defarge, the owner of the tavern in the Saint Antoine district.</t4384> <t4385>Surely you have heard of me.</t4385>
<t4386>− Has my wife gone to your house to bring her father back?</t4386> <t4387>That's right! The word "wife" seemed to be a dark reminder for Defarge, making him suddenly irritable.</t4387>
<t4388>− In the name of the newly born sharp lady named La Guillotine*, I ask why you returned to France? −</t4388> <t4389>You heard me give the new reason just now.</t4389> <t4390>Do you not believe that is the truth? −</t4390> <t4391>A terrible truth for you, - Defarge said, frowning, looking straight ahead.</t4391>
<t4392>− Honestly, I am bewildered to be here.</t4392> <t4393>Everything here is too strange, too changed, too unexpected, and unfair, to the point of not understanding anything at all.</t4393> <t4394>Can you help me a little? −</t4394> <t4395>No.</t4395> <t4396>- Defarge said, his eyes still looking straight ahead.</t4396>
<t4397>− Can you answer just one question for me? −</t4397> <t4398>Maybe.</t4398> <t4399>It depends on the nature of the question.</t4399> <t4400>Just say it straight out.</t4400>
<t4401>− In that prison where I will be unjustly detained, will I have any freedom to communicate with the outside world? −</t4401> <t4402>You will find out soon enough.</t4402>
<t4403>− Will I be buried there for life, will I be judged, is there any way to justify myself? −</t4403> <t4404>You will know soon.</t4404> <t4405>But what if there is?</t4405> <t4406>Many people have been buried like that in prison before.</t4406>
<t4407>− But it wasn't caused by me, Citizen Defarge.</t4407>
<t4408>Defarge responded with a dark look and continued walking, silent and unspeaking.</t4408> <t4409>The more sullen and silent he became, Darnay thought, the less hope he had that Defarge would soften even a little.</t4409> <t4410>Darnay hurriedly continued speaking: −</t4410> <t4411>There is something extremely important to me; you know, Citizen, even better than I do about its importance; I need to inform Mr. Lorry of Tellson's Bank, an English gentleman currently in Paris, a simple matter, without any comment, that I have been imprisoned in La Force.</t4411> <t4412>Can you help me with that? −</t4412> <t4413>I will do nothing for you, - Defarge insisted.</t4413> <t4414>My duty is to serve my country and my people.</t4414> <t4415>I have sworn to oppose people like you for those two reasons.</t4415> <t4416>I will do nothing for you.</t4416>
<t4417>Charles Darnay found that making another request was hopeless; moreover, his pride would be hurt.</t4417> <t4418>As they walked quietly, he couldn't help but notice that the people had become too accustomed to the sight of prisoners being escorted through the streets.</t4418> <t4419>Even children didn't bother to pay attention to him.</t4419> <t4420>A few people passing by turned to look, a few gestured at him as if he were a nobleman; besides that, the sight of a well-dressed person going to prison was no more special than that of a laborer in shabby clothes going to work.</t4420> <t4421>In a narrow, dark, filthy street they passed through, an impassioned orator stood on a stool, speaking to an eager crowd about the crimes against the people committed by the king and the royal family.</t4421> <t4422>Now, hearing a few words from this person, Charles Darnay learned that the king had been imprisoned and all foreign envoys had left Paris, leaving no one behind.</t4422> <t4423>Along the way (except when in Beauvais), he hadn't heard any news.</t4423> <t4424>The escort and the surveillance everywhere had completely isolated him.</t4424>
<t4425>Now, of course, he knew that he had fallen into dangers far greater than those that had arisen since he left England.</t4425> <t4426>Now, of course, he knew that those dangers were quickly closing in on him and the situation had become increasingly urgent.</t4426> <t4427>He had to admit to himself that if he had known about these developments a few days earlier, he would not have taken that trip.</t4427> <t4428>However, looking back more clearly later, we will see that Darnay's worries were not as bleak as he thought.</t4428> <t4429>Even if the future is uncertain, it remains an unknown future, and it is precisely because of this uncertainty that we still have hope.</t4429>
<t4430>In his understanding, there was no hint of the horrific massacre that lasted many days and nights, a massacre that, in just a few turns of the clock's hands, had stained an entire season of fortunate fruits with blood; that image seemed as distant as if it had been a hundred thousand years ago.</t4430> <t4431>Neither he nor the French populace knew anything about "the newly born sharp lady named La Guillotine".</t4431>
<t4432>The terrible things that will be done perhaps even at this moment cannot be imagined even by those who will carry them out.</t4432> <t4433>So how can a gentle mind possibly conceive of that in its own obscure awareness?</t4433> <t4434>He had anticipated the possibility, or certainty, of being unjustly mistreated in harsh captivity, suffering the pain of separation from his wife and children; but beyond those things, he had no specific fears.</t4434> <t4435>With that mindset, he stepped into the bleak courtyard of La Force prison - he had arrived.</t4435>
<t4436>A fat-faced man opened a small hatch in the iron gate for Defarge to hand over the "Exiled Evrémonde".</t4436>
<t4437>− Oh my god! How many more people are there! - The fat-faced guy exclaimed.</t4437>
<t4438>Not bothering to pay attention to the complaints, Defarge took the certificate and withdrew, along with his two patriotic Citizens.</t4438>
<t4439>− Oh my God! I can't keep quiet! - The jailer exclaimed again when he was alone with his wife. - How much more! −</t4439> <t4440>We must be patient, dear! - Unable to give a precise answer, the jailer's wife only responded like that and then rang the bell to call in the three wardens.</t4440>
<t4441>They also agreed with her, and one person added, "For the love of Freedom," a phrase that echoed in this place like a paradoxical conclusion.</t4441>
<t4442>La Force Prison is a gloomy, dark, and filthy place, reeking of the foul stench of death.</t4442> <t4443>The overpowering smell of death, confined within, manifests so quickly and terribly in any place that is not properly cared for! −</t4443> <t4444>Solitary confinement again! - The jailer grumbled, looking at the paper.</t4444> <t4445>- As if it weren't already overcrowded here!</t4445> <t4446>He filed the paper away irritably, and Charles Darnay patiently waited for another half hour; sometimes he paced back and forth in the sturdy vaulted room, sometimes he sat on the stone bench - long enough for the jailer and his subordinates to remember him.</t4446>
<t4447>− Let's go! - Finally, the warden picked up the bunch of keys. - Follow me, exile.</t4447>
<t4448>In the gloomy twilight of the prison, the person who had just received Darnay led him through corridors and staircases, with many doors clicking open and shut, locking behind them, until they reached a low-ceilinged, vaulted room crowded with both male and female prisoners.</t4448> <t4449>The women sat at a long table, reading, writing, knitting, and embroidering; most of the men were leaning against the backs of chairs or pacing back and forth in the room.</t4449>
<t4450>The newcomer instinctively wanted to retreat and stay away when encountering this group of prisoners full of shameful sins.</t4450> <t4451>But the surreal, dream-like feeling throughout his long journey reached its peak when all those prisoners immediately stood up to welcome him with the most elegant, refined, and graceful manners of the contemporary nobility.</t4451>
<t4452>How tragic those delicate gestures were in the desolate scene of this prison, how ghostly they appeared in this wretched, filthy, ironic place, to the point that Charles Darnay felt as if he were standing before a crowd of corpses.</t4452> <t4453>All ghosts! Ghosts of beauty, ghosts of dignity, ghosts of grace, ghosts of pride, ghosts of frivolity, ghosts of cunning, ghosts of youth, ghosts of old age, all waiting to leave this desolate shore, all turning their eyes, transformed by the torment of death, towards him as they buried their lives in this prison.</t4453>
<t4454>He stood there stunned and silent.</t4454> <t4455>The prison warden stood next to him and the other wardens around, who would not look so bad in their normal daily work, but compared to the grieving mothers, the young girls in their prime in this prison, the ghosts with their graceful appearance, the youthful beauty and mature elegance of the noblewomen - they looked strangely rough, contrasting to the extent that this dark scene became extremely eerie.</t4455> <t4456>Yes, all ghosts.</t4456> <t4457>Yes, the long, illusory journey, the miserable miles, had brought him to meet these sorrowful ghosts! −</t4457> <t4458>In the name of the friends met in misfortune, - a man of noble appearance and polite speech approached, - I am honored to welcome you to La Force, and to sympathize with the misfortune that has brought you to us.</t4458> <t4459>May it quickly have a happy ending! Elsewhere it might be rude to ask, but not here, may I know your name and status? Charles Darnay awoke and responded with the words he found most appropriate.</t4459>
<t4460>− But I hope that, - the nobleman said while glancing at the chief warden who was walking across the room, - you are not in solitary confinement? −</t4460> <t4461>I don't fully understand the meaning of that word but I have heard them say it.</t4461>
<t4462>− Ah, how pitiful!</t4462> <t4463>We are very sorry!</t4463> <t4464>But be brave; many people in our circle have been in solitary confinement at first, but only for a short time.</t4464> <t4465>- Then he raised his voice and spoke to everyone.</t4465> <t4466>- It is with great sadness that I must inform you... solitary confinement.</t4466>
<t4467>The murmurs of concern echoed as Charles Darnay walked through the room to the barred door where the jailer was waiting for him, many blessings and encouragements were given to him - among which the most distinct was the sympathetic, gentle voice of a woman.</t4467> <t4468>At the barred door, he turned to express his gratitude; the door closed under the jailer's hand; and those shadows disappeared forever.</t4468>
<t4469>That doorway led to a stone staircase, leading upwards.</t4469> <t4470>When they had climbed about forty steps (the prisoner, having been confined for half an hour, had counted the steps), the jailer opened a low, black door, and they entered the confinement cell.</t4470> <t4471>Cold, damp, but not dark.</t4471>
<t4472>− It's yours, - the jailer said.</t4472>
<t4473>− Why am I being held in solitary confinement? −</t4473> <t4474>How would I know? − Can I buy a pen, paper, and ink? −</t4474> <t4475>I don't know if you can.</t4475> <t4476>Someone will come to see you, and you can ask them then.</t4476> <t4477>For now, you can only buy food and nothing else.</t4477>
<t4478>In the cell, there was a chair, a table, and a straw mattress.</t4478> <t4479>While the guard was inspecting these items and the four walls before leaving, a vague delusion flitted through the mind of the prisoner who was standing leaning against the opposite wall: this guard was swelling up in a morbid way, both his face and body, like a drowned man bloated with water.</t4479> <t4480>After the guard left, he also thought vaguely, "Now it's just me, as if I were already dead."</t4480> <t4481>Cutting off his thoughts, he looked down at the mattress and then turned away in disgust, "Seeing the bugs crawling here is the first stage of a corpse's decay."</t4481>
<t4482>“One side five steps, one side four and a half, one side five steps, one side four and a half, one side five steps, one side four and a half.”</t4482> <t4483>The prisoner walked back and forth in the cell, counting the length, and the roar of the city below echoed up like a muffled drum accompanied by a chaotic wave of human voices.</t4483> <t4484>“He makes shoes, he makes shoes, he makes shoes.”</t4484> <t4485>The prisoner counted the length again, quickening his pace, to drive that thought from resurfacing in his mind. “The ghosts disappear when that door closes.</t4485> <t4486>Among them is a lady in black leaning against the window, and she has bright golden hair, and she looks like...</t4486> <t4487>Let us rush on, dear God, through the lit houses and the sleepless people!...</t4487> <t4488>He makes shoes, he makes shoes, he makes shoes...</t4488> <t4489>One side five steps, one side four and a half.”</t4489> <t4490>With those fragmented thoughts raging inside, the prisoner walked faster, faster, stubbornly counting his steps; and the roar of the city changed its tone... it still droned like a muffled drum but a rising chaotic wave of human voices turned into the lament of dear brothers.</t4490>
<t4491>2.</t4491> <t4492>Grinding wheel</t4492>
<t4493>The Tellson Bank in Paris was located in the Saint Germain area in an annex of a large mansion, deep at the end of a courtyard, separated from the street by a high wall and a sturdy gate.</t4493> <t4494>This house belonged to a grand noble before he fled from danger, disguised in the clothes of his own chef, and crossed the border.</t4494> <t4495>He was merely a beast being hunted, but in his previous life, he was the Lord who, every morning, needed three servants along with the aforementioned chef to lift the chocolate cup to his lips.</t4495>
<t4496>The lord had departed, and the three servants had absolved themselves of the guilt of receiving high wages from the noble by eagerly resolving to cut the throat of their former master to offer as a sacrifice on the altar of the nascent United Indivisible Republic of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death, when the mansion of this grand official had been confiscated and nationalized.</t4496> <t4497>The situation developed too swiftly, with one decree following another, frantically and urgently, so on the third night of September in the autumn, the patriotic delegation of the new government took over the lord's mansion, marked it with the tricolor flag, and drank brandy in the luxurious rooms inside.</t4497>
<t4498>A business place in London like Tellson's in Paris would quickly drive the Owner mad and declare bankruptcy in the Gazette. How would these calm, responsible, and respectable Englishmen react to the orange trees in pots in front of the bank, and to the statue of Cupid on the counter?</t4498> <t4499>But Tellson's in Paris was like that. The staff here had painted the statue of Cupid white, but it could still be seen hanging from the ceiling, dressed in thin fabric, aiming its bow at money from morning till night (often the target of love).</t4499> <t4500>In Lombard Street, London, if one saw this little deity, saw the alcove draped behind it, saw the mirror mounted on the wall, and saw all the young employees easily getting angry with customers, it would only lead to bankruptcy.</t4500> <t4501>Yet at Tellson's in France, these things did not matter; the bank thrived, as long as the situation remained under control and no one panicked and withdrew all their money.</t4501>
<t4502>From now on, how much money will be withdrawn from Tellson, how much will remain there, lost and forgotten; how many gold and silver treasures will tarnish in Tellson's vaults while their owners, who deposited them, rot in prison or will one day die in pieces; how many Tellson accounts will never be settled in this world and must be transferred to the next?</t4502> <t4503>No one could answer that, on that night, not even Mr. Jarvis Lorry, although he was pondering those very questions.</t4503> <t4504>He sat by the newly lit fireplace (this withering year turned cold early), on his brave and honest face was a dark shadow that neither the hanging lamp nor any distorted reflection in this room could dispel the darkness of horror.</t4504>
<t4505>Dedicated to the club that had become intimately attached to his entire life, he stayed permanently in this bank.</t4505> <t4506>It was also by chance that the Tellson Bank in Paris was safely protected by a group of patriots who had occupied the main building, but this honest old man never considered that.</t4506> <t4507>He was indifferent to all circumstances, only knowing to perform his duty.</t4507> <t4508>At the other end of the courtyard, under the colonnade, was a long stretch of ground reserved for carriages, in fact, a few old lordly carriages were still there.</t4508> <t4509>Two large torches were tightly fastened to two columns, and glaring under the torchlight, one could see a large grindstone wheel exposed to the sky, haphazardly placed there as if it had been hastily brought from a nearby forge or workshop.</t4509> <t4510>Standing up to look at those harmless objects outside the window, Mr. Lorry involuntarily shuddered and turned back to sit by the fireplace.</t4510> <t4511>He had not only opened the glass window but also the outer shutters, then he had to go back and close both layers of the window and shivered all over.</t4511>
<t4512>From the street, through the high wall and the sturdy gate, came the usual murmuring sounds of the capital's night. Occasionally, there was an indescribable, strange, and extraordinary resonant sound, like eerie noises from the terrifying depths rising to the sky.</t4512>
<t4513>− Thank God, - Mr. Lorry said with clasped hands, - fortunately, none of my loved ones are in this dreadful city tonight. May He have mercy on those in distress!</t4513> <t4514>Soon after, there was a bell at the main gate and he thought to himself, "They have returned!" and sat still, listening intently.</t4514> <t4515>But there was no loud commotion of people disturbing the courtyard as he had imagined; instead, he heard the gate slam shut, and then all was silent.</t4515>
<t4516>That restless anxiety only made his heart more tense and uneasy about the bank's safety; with any important establishment, such worries naturally arise.</t4516> <t4517>The bank was well-protected. He stood up, intending to meet the trusted individuals guarding the place, when the door suddenly burst open, two figures rushed in, and he was stunned to see them.</t4517>
<t4518>Lucie and her father! Lucie stretched out her arms towards him, and on her forehead was a look of concentration and worry, as if that expression had gathered all its strength for this moment in life.</t4518>
<t4519>− What is this? - Mr. Lorry exclaimed, bewildered and out of breath.</t4519> <t4520>What happened? Lucie! Manette!</t4520> <t4521>What happened?</t4521> <t4522>What brought you two here?</t4522> <t4523>What is it?</t4523> <t4524>Her eyes still fixed on him, her face pale and panic-stricken, Lucie rushed into his arms, her voice choked with urgency.</t4524>
<t4525>− Oh sir! My husband! − Your husband, Lucie? − Charles.</t4525>
<t4526>− How is Charles? − Here.</t4526>
<t4527>− Here, in Paris? −</t4527> <t4528>I've been here for a few days... three or four days... I don't remember exactly... I can't think clearly.</t4528> <t4529>Some noble cause brought my husband here without letting anyone at home know; he was stopped at the city gate and imprisoned.</t4529>
<t4530>The old man couldn't suppress an exclamation.</t4530> <t4531>Almost simultaneously, the bell outside the gate rang again, and the sound of footsteps and loud voices filled the yard.</t4531>
<t4532>− What is that noise? - Doctor Manette asked as he turned to the window.</t4532>
<t4533>− Don't look! - Mr. Lorry exclaimed. - Don't look out! Manette, for your life, don't open the door!</t4533> <t4534>The doctor turned back, his hand on the window latch, and said with a calm, brave smile: −</t4534> <t4535>My dear friend, I once had an interesting time in this city.</t4535>
<t4536>I was once a prisoner of the Bastille.</t4536> <t4537>There is no patriot in Paris...</t4537>
<t4538>In Paris? No, in all of France... they would bring up my past as a prisoner of the Bastille, if they didn't rush to embrace me or lift me up in joy.</t4538> <t4539>My past suffering now becomes a power that helps us overcome all barriers, and gives us news about Charles in France, then brings us here.</t4539> <t4540>I knew the situation had to be like that; I knew I could help Charles escape from danger; I told Lucie so...</t4540> <t4541>What is that noise? - His hand again placed on the window latch.</t4541>
<t4542>− Don't look out! - Mr. Lorry exclaimed, completely desperate.</t4542> <t4543>- Don't, Lucie, my dear, you don't either! - He wrapped his arms tightly around the girl.</t4543> <t4544>Don't be too alarmed, my dear.</t4544> <t4545>I swear to you that I had no knowledge of any danger befalling Charles; I didn't even know he was in this deadly place.</t4545> <t4546>Which prison is he in? − La Force! − La Force! Lucie, my dear, if you are brave and know how to help others... as you always have been... then now you must remain calm and do exactly what I tell you; because everything depends on it, more than you think or I can say.</t4546> <t4547>Tonight, whatever you do will be useless; you cannot go out on the street.</t4547> <t4548>I say this because, for Charles's sake, what I am asking of you is the hardest thing to do.</t4548> <t4549>You must obey me, sit still and stay calm.</t4549> <t4550>Let me take you to a room in the back to rest for a while.</t4550> <t4551>You must let your father and me discuss privately for a few minutes, this is a matter of life and death, you must not delay.</t4551>
<t4552>− I will listen to you, Grandpa.</t4552> <t4553>Looking at you, I know I can't do anything else.</t4553> <t4554>I know you are right.</t4554>
<t4555>The old man kissed the girl, hurriedly took her into his room and locked the door, then hastily returned to the doctor, and while opening the window and slightly drawing the curtain, he took Mr. Manette's arm, and they both looked out into the yard.</t4555>
<t4556>Looking out at a crowd of men and women: not so crowded as to overflow the courtyard: about forty or fifty people at most.</t4556>
<t4557>The people who took over this mansion opened the gate for them to enter, and they rushed to the grindstone to get it working; clearly, that object was placed here for a purpose, in a convenient and discreet location.</t4557>
<t4558>But the people were truly terrible, and the deeds were truly terrible!</t4558><t4559>The grindstone had two cranks, being frantically turned by two men; the fierce spinning threw their long hair back, exposing two faces more brutal and terrifying than the most savage-looking barbarians.</t4559><t4560>False eyebrows and fake mustaches were attached to their ghastly faces, drenched in sweat and blood, their entire faces distorted by the screams, the blazing eyes filled with animalistic eagerness, and the lack of sleep.</t4560><t4561>While these two ruffians turned the wheel incessantly, their matted hair sometimes flung forward covering their eyes, sometimes flung back covering their necks, women lifted cups of wine to their lips; the wine as red as blood, the sparks flying from the grindstone, making the entire savage space seem filled with blood and fire.</t4561><t4562>No matter how closely one looked, there was no one among these people who was not stained with blood.</t4562><t4563>Clustered shoulder to shoulder around the grindstone were half-naked men, their limbs and bodies smeared with blood; men dressed in rags, those rags also blood-stained; fierce men wearing lace, silk, and ribbons snatched from women, those trinkets also dyed with blood.</t4563><t4564>Axes, knives, bayonets, swords, all waiting to be sharpened, were all a deep red color.</t4564><t4565>Many large swords were tightly bound to the wielders' wrists with strips of cloth torn from clothing; all kinds of bindings, all soaked in blood.</t4565><t4566>And as the chaotic armed mob grabbed weapons from the torrent of sparks and rushed into the streets, their mad eyes burned with the same red hue - the eyes of wild beasts that anyone with a shred of humanity would be willing to sacrifice twenty years of their life to shoot dead on the spot.</t4566>
<t4567>That scene appeared only for a moment, like the fleeting world in the final gaze of a drowning person or anyone in a perilous situation.</t4567><t4568>The two men stepped back from the window, and the doctor searched for an answer on his friend's pale face.</t4568><t4569>Mr. Lorry whispered while fearfully glancing at the locked door: −</t4569><t4570>They are going to kill the prisoners.</t4570><t4571>If you are certain of what you are saying; if you truly have the power you believe you possess... although I believe you do... please introduce yourself to those devils and ask them to take you to La Force prison.</t4571><t4572>It might already be too late, I'm not sure, but we cannot delay any longer! Dr. Manette squeezed Mr. Lorry's hand, hurriedly left the room with his head uncovered, and proceeded into the courtyard while Mr. Lorry drew the window curtain to look out.</t4572>
<t4573>The long white hair, the radiant face, and the intense confident demeanor of Mr. Manette as he brushed aside the weapons of those people like a ship cutting through water, brought him straight into the heart of the crowd gathered around the grindstone.</t4573> <t4574>The crowd paused for a moment, then hurried, then murmured, then the indistinct voice of the doctor; then Mr. Lorry saw Mr. Manette, surrounded by the crowd, standing in the midst of a group of about twenty people, all shoulder to shoulder, hastily moving out while shouting "Long live the prisoner of the Bastille! Save the relatives of the prisoner of the Bastille who are imprisoned in La Force! Make way for the prisoner of the Bastille!</t4574> <t4575>Save the prisoner Evrémonde in La Force!" and a thousand voices echoed in response.</t4575>
<t4576>He closed the shutters, his heart pounding, then closed the outer window and drew the curtains, hurriedly going to Lucie to inform her that the people had helped to search for Charles.</t4576> <t4577>Lucie was not alone but was accompanied by a little girl and Miss Pross; however, it was only much later that Mr. Lorry, while sitting and watching them in the familiar stillness of the night, realized this with surprise.</t4577>
<t4578>Lucie, by that time, had fallen asleep on the floor at Mr. Lorry's feet, one hand still clutching his hand.</t4578> <t4579>Earlier, Miss Pross had placed the baby on his bed, her head slowly leaning down onto the pillow beside this charming responsibility.</t4579> <t4580>Oh, how the night dragged on with the sighs of the poor wife!</t4580> <t4581>Oh, how the night dragged on with no news of the father who had not returned!</t4581> <t4582>Twice more in the dark night, the gate bell rang and a crowd surged in, and the grindstone wheel hissed and spun furiously.</t4582>
<t4583>− What's happening? - Lucie cried out in fear.</t4583>
<t4584>− Shh! The soldiers' swords are sharpened here, - Mr. Lorry said.</t4584>
<t4585>- This place is now national property and is used as an armory, my dear.</t4585>
<t4586>Then two more times like that; but the last time there were fewer people and it was brief.</t4586> <t4587>Immediately after that, the sky began to lighten and Mr. Lorry gently separated the girl's hand that was tightly gripping his, carefully walked to the window and looked out.</t4587> <t4588>A man, covered in blood like a severely wounded soldier just regaining consciousness on a slaughtered battlefield, stood up from the roadside near the grinding wheel and looked around with a dazed expression.</t4588> <t4589>Soon after, in the dim light, this exhausted murderer saw a Lord's carriage, staggered towards it, opened the door, climbed in, closed the door, and lay down to sleep on the luxurious cushioned benches.</t4589>
<t4590>The Earth, the great wheel, had completed its rotation when Mr. Lorry looked out once more and the sun dyed the outer yard red.</t4590> <t4591>But the smaller grindstone wheel still stood solitary there in the tranquil morning, stained red with a color not bestowed by the sunlight, and which would never fade.</t4591>
<t4592>3.</t4592> <t4593>Darkness</t4593>
<t4594>One of the first considerations that arose in Mr. Lorry's professional mind as work time approached was the thought: he had no right to endanger Tellson's Bank by sheltering the wife of an exiled prisoner within the bank.</t4594> <t4595>He was ready to sacrifice his property and personal safety for Lucie and her little girl without hesitation; but the work entrusted to him was not his alone, and with that responsibility, he resolutely placed his duty above all else.</t4595>
<t4596>At first, his mind thought of Defarge and considered going to that tavern again to ask the innkeeper to introduce him to the safest refuge in the madness of this city.</t4596> <t4597>But that very consideration made him abandon the idea; Defarge was living right in the most brutal area, certainly had influence there, and was undoubtedly deeply involved in the current dangerous situation.</t4597>
<t4598>By noon, the doctor still hadn't returned, and each minute of delay was making things more difficult for Tellson's Bank, so Mr. Lorry had to discuss it with Lucie.</t4598>
<t4599>Lucie said that her father intended to rent a short-term lodging in an area near the bank.</t4599> <t4600>Since renting a house did not affect the company, and he anticipated that even if everything went well and Charles was released, he might still hope to leave the capital, Mr. Lorry went out to find a lodging, found a suitable place, on a high floor, in a secluded small street, where all the windows with drawn curtains indicated that these were vacant houses.</t4600>
<t4601>He immediately took Lucie and Miss Pross to their lodging; providing them with all possible conveniences, even more convenient than he arranged for himself.</t4601> <t4602>He left Jerry with them as a barrier at the door, ready to take a punch to the head, and then returned to his work.</t4602> <t4603>He worked with a heart full of anxiety and suffering, and the long day passed slowly and heavily.</t4603>
<t4604>The dragging days wore down time, and wore him down, until the bank closed.</t4604> <t4605>He was alone again in the room like the night before, contemplating what to do when he heard footsteps on the stairs.</t4605> <t4606>A moment later, someone was standing in front of him, with sharp eyes observing, calling his name directly.</t4606>
<t4607>− Glad to be of service, - said Mr. Lorry.</t4607> <t4608>- Do you know me?</t4608> <t4609>He was a burly man, with curly black hair, around forty-five to fifty years old.</t4609>
<t4610>Instead of answering, he repeated the man's words, showing no expression: −</t4610> <t4611>Do you know me? −</t4611> <t4612>I've met you somewhere before.</t4612>
<t4613>− Perhaps at my tavern?</t4613> <t4614>With a clear look of concern and emotion, Mr. Lorry said: −</t4614> <t4615>Did Mr. Manette send you here? −</t4615> <t4616>Yes, Mr. Manette sent me here.</t4616>
<t4617>− And what did he say?</t4617> <t4618>Did he leave any message for me?</t4618> <t4619>Defarge handed an open piece of paper into the other anxious hand.</t4619> <t4620>The letter was written in the doctor's handwriting: Charles is safe, but I cannot safely leave this place yet.</t4620> <t4621>I have arranged for the bearer of this letter to deliver a short letter from Charles to his wife.</t4621> <t4622>Let the bearer of this letter meet Charles's wife.</t4622>
<t4623>The letter is dated from La Force prison, an hour ago.</t4623>
<t4624>− Will you agree to come with me to this man's wife's place? - Mr. Lorry felt happy and relieved after reading the letter.</t4624>
<t4625>− Agreed, - Defarge replied.</t4625>
<t4626>Not noticing that Defarge's manner of speaking was very cautious and unusually mechanical, Mr. Lorry put on his hat and the two of them went down to the yard.</t4626> <t4627>There, they met two women; one of them was knitting.</t4627>
<t4628>− Yes, Madame Defarge, that's right! - Mr. Lorry said, seventeen years ago when he left Paris, he had met her exactly like this.</t4628>
<t4629>− That's right, - the husband said.</t4629>
<t4630>− Is she coming with us? - Mr. Lorry asked when he saw her following along.</t4630>
<t4631>− Yes.</t4631> <t4632>So that she can recognize faces, recognize people.</t4632> <t4633>For their safety.</t4633>
<t4634>Starting to be surprised by Defarge's attitude, Mr. Lorry looked at him suspiciously and then led the way.</t4634> <t4635>Both women followed; the second woman was the Goddess of Revenge.</t4635>
<t4636>They quickly passed through the separating streets, up the stairs to the new place, were let in by Jerry, and found Lucie crying alone.</t4636> <t4637>She was overjoyed when Mr. Lorry brought news of Charles, and she tightly grasped the hand of the person who had delivered her husband's letter—without thinking that this very hand had killed a prisoner the night before, and perhaps, given the chance, would have killed her husband too.</t4637>
<t4638>My love - Be brave.</t4638> <t4639>I am still well, and your father can influence the people here.</t4639> <t4640>This letter does not require a reply.</t4640> <t4641>Kiss our child for me.</t4641>
<t4642>The letter was just that.</t4642> <t4643>But it was extremely meaningful to the recipient, her, to the point that she turned from Defarge to his wife and kissed a hand that was holding a knitting needle.</t4643> <t4644>It was a warm, loving, appreciative gesture from a woman, but the hand did not react - it coldly pulled back and continued knitting.</t4644>
<t4645>The collision had a strange feeling that made Lucie numb.</t4645> <t4646>The letter, not yet brought to her chest, suddenly stopped, her hands flailing, she looked at the woman in horror.</t4646> <t4647>Madame Defarge only raised her eyebrows and furrowed her brow, her eyes cold and emotionless.</t4647>
<t4648>− My child, - Mr. Lorry tried to explain, - there are frequent riots on the streets now, although that may not affect you, Mrs. Defarge wants to meet those she can protect in this situation, to know their faces, to identify them when needed.</t4648> <t4649>Am I right, Citizen Defarge? Mr. Lorry was quite cautious in his reassuring words as the increasingly cold attitude of the other three made him more suspicious.</t4649> <t4650>Defarge looked gloomily at his wife, responding only with a curt sound of agreement.</t4650>
<t4651>− It would be best if you brought the girl out here, and Miss Pross too, - Mr. Lorry tried his best to calm the situation, both with his voice and his demeanor.</t4651> <t4652>Defarge, our kind Miss Pross is English and does not speak French.</t4652>
<t4653>Firmly believing that she was not inferior to any foreigner, Miss Pross was undaunted by any danger; she stepped forward, arms crossed over her chest, and upon encountering the Goddess of Revenge, she immediately exclaimed, "Ah, certainly a brazen face here!</t4653> <t4654>Hope you're doing well!" She also spat an English phrase towards Madame Defarge; but neither of the other two paid any attention.</t4654>
<t4655>− Is that his child? - Mrs. Defarge, now stopping her work, pointed the tip of her knitting needle like a finger of Fate towards little Lucie.</t4655>
<t4656>− Yes, ma'am, - Mr. Lorry replied, - this is the beloved daughter of that poor prisoner, and she is his only child.</t4656>
<t4657>The darkness associated with Madame Defarge and her two followers seemed to envelop the child with a sinister and threatening aura, causing the mother to instinctively kneel down beside her child and hold the child tightly in her arms.</t4657> <t4658>The darkness of Madame Defarge and her two followers seemed to cast a sinister and threatening shadow over both mother and child.</t4658>
<t4659>− Enough, dear, - Mrs. Defarge said to her husband.</t4659> <t4660>- I have seen their faces.</t4660>
<t4661>We can go now.</t4661>
<t4662>But even though she tried to restrain herself and not reveal anything, her vague and evasive attitude was so threatening that Lucie, in panic, spoke while clutching at Madame Defarge's dress as if pleading: −</t4662> <t4663>Please be kind to my husband.</t4663> <t4664>Please don't harm him.</t4664> <t4665>Can you help me see him? −</t4665> <t4666>My business has nothing to do with your husband/ - Madame Defarge replied, her eyes coldly staring at Lucie.</t4666> <t4667>- My business is with you, the daughter of Dr. Manette.</t4667>
<t4668>− Then please have mercy on my husband for my sake.</t4668> <t4669>Please have mercy for my child! The little one will clasp their hands and pray for you to show kindness.</t4669> <t4670>We fear you more than anyone else here.</t4670>
<t4671>Mrs. Defarge took it as a compliment and looked at her husband.</t4671> <t4672>Defarge, who had been nervously biting his finger and watching his wife, now put on a more severe and stern expression.</t4672>
<t4673>− What did your husband say in that letter? - Mrs. Defarge asked, smirking.</t4673> <t4674>- Influence, what did he say about influence? −</t4674> <t4675>That is my father, - Lucie hastily put down the letter she was holding to her chest, but her frightened eyes still looked directly at the person asking the question rather than at the letter, - my father can influence the people here.</t4675>
<t4676>− Surely he will influence to release him! - Mrs. Defarge said.</t4676> <t4677>Go ahead.</t4677>
<t4678>− As a wife and a mother, - Lucie cried out passionately, - I beg you to have mercy on me, please do not use your power to harm my innocent husband, please help him.</t4678> <t4679>Oh, as a fellow woman, please think of me.</t4679> <t4680>As a wife and a mother! Madame Defarge remained cold to this plea, she turned to her companion - the Goddess of Retribution: −</t4680> <t4681>The wives and mothers we have encountered, since we were as young as this child, even younger, did anyone care about them?</t4681> <t4682>We have become too accustomed to their husbands and fathers being imprisoned and separated from their families, haven't we?</t4682> <t4683>All our lives we have only seen women suffering, their children suffering, all in poverty, in rags, hungry, sick, miserable, oppressed, and abandoned in every way, haven't we? −</t4683> <t4684>We have seen nothing else, - the Goddess of Retribution replied.</t4684>
<t4685>− We have endured for too long, - Madame Defarge turned her eyes towards Lucie.</t4685> <t4686>- What do you know! Does the suffering of a wife and a mother mean anything significant to us now?</t4686> <t4687>She continued knitting and walked out.</t4687> <t4688>The Goddess of Vengeance followed her.</t4688>
<t4689>Defarge went last and closed the door.</t4689>
<t4690>− Courage, dear Lucie, - Mr. Lorry said as he helped her to her feet.</t4690> <t4691>- Courage, courage! So far everything is fine - fine, much better than many less fortunate people recently.</t4691> <t4692>Cheer up, and be grateful for that.</t4692>
<t4693>− I am not ungrateful, I have hope, but that dreadful woman seems to cast a shadow over all my hopes.</t4693>
<t4694>− Tsk, tsk! - Mr. Lorry said. - Why does that brave little heart get discouraged so quickly? Truly a shadow!</t4694> <t4695>Nothing substantial at all, Lucie.</t4695>
<t4696>However, the attitude of the Defarge couple also cast a shadow over Mr. Lorry, and it was this that caused him great anxiety.</t4696>
<t4697>4.</t4697> <t4698>Peace in the storm</t4698>
<t4699>Absent until the morning of the fourth day, Dr. Manette only returned in the morning.</t4699> <t4700>The doctor and Mr. Lorry had kept many things that happened during those four days and nights hidden from Lucie; it was only later, when she was far from France, that she learned that one thousand one hundred innocent prisoners, both old and young, men and women, had been killed by the populace; four days and nights had been darkened by this terrible act, and the air around her was heavy with the stench of massacre.</t4700> <t4701>At that time, she only knew that there had been an attack on the prisons and all political prisoners were in danger, with some being dragged out and killed by the mob.</t4701>
<t4702>Dr. Manette, after unnecessarily making Mr. Lorry promise to keep it secret, recounted the scene of slaughter he had witnessed when he was taken to La Force by the crowd that night. Then, in that prison, he saw a self-convened court, where each prisoner was brought out for trial and swiftly received their verdict: execution, release, or (in some cases) re-imprisonment.</t4702> <t4703>After being brought before the tribunal by the crowd, Dr. Manette revealed the identity and profession he had kept hidden for eighteen years, as well as his past imprisonment in the Bastille; then one of the members of the judging group stood up to confirm his story, and that person was Defarge.</t4703>
<t4704>Then, knowing for sure that his son-in-law was among the surviving prisoners listed on the table, Mr. Manette urgently pleaded for his son-in-law’s release and life with the group of judges - some awake, some asleep, some sober, some drunk, some clean, some blood-stained.</t4704> <t4705>After the initial frenzied welcome given to him as a victimized gentleman under the overthrown regime, everyone agreed to bring Charles Darnay to trial before this unlawful court.</t4705> <t4706>Then, just as Darnay was about to be set free, the favorable turn was suddenly obstructed without any explanation (the doctor could not understand why), causing the judges to hold a brief private consultation.</t4706> <t4707>Then, the presiding figure announced to Dr. Manette that they would continue to detain the prisoner, but for his own benefit, he would be held safely without harm.</t4707> <t4708>Then, immediately, they signaled to return the prisoner to his cell; but upon hearing this, Mr. Manette fervently pleaded to stay in the prison to ensure that his son-in-law, due to no misfortune or malice, would be handed over to the crowd outside the gate howling for blood; then, he was granted permission and stayed in that Temple of Blood until the danger had passed.</t4708>
<t4709>Dr. Manette did not recount what he had witnessed in prison between meals and the brief moments of sleep snatched from time.</t4709>
<t4710>The insane joy of the prisoners who escaped death did not astonish him as much as the insane brutality towards those unfortunate enough to be dismembered.</t4710> <t4711>One prisoner there, he recounted, was released to go outside, but upon stepping onto the street, that person was mistakenly speared by a savage weapon.</t4711> <t4712>Due to the crowd's pleas, a doctor went out to bandage the wound of the unfortunate person; he too went out through that same gate and found himself amidst a group of volunteer militia sitting on the corpses of the victims they had killed.</t4712> <t4713>With the same ghastly inconsistency as anything in that horrifying nightmare, they themselves assisted the doctor in caring for the mistakenly speared person with utmost concern and care - they made a stretcher and escorted the injured person out of that dangerous place - then they themselves grabbed weapons and plunged into a new massacre, so horrific that Mr. Manette had to cover his eyes and fainted amidst the slaughter.</t4713>
<t4714>While Mr. Lorry listened to those confessions and looked at the face of his friend, now sixty-two years old, he became worried that Dr. Manette's old affliction might recur when going through these horrifying events.</t4714>
<t4715>But Mr. Lorry had never seen his friend in his current aspect; had never known his friend in his current character.</t4715>
<t4716>Because this was the first time the doctor felt that his own suffering was a source of strength and power.</t4716> <t4717>Because this was the first time he felt that in that burning flame, he had gradually forged an iron bar to pry open the prison door and free his daughter's husband.</t4717>
<t4718>− Everything will end well, my friend; it won't be entirely in vain and destructive.</t4718> <t4719>Just as my beloved daughter helped me recover, now I will help bring Charles back to my daughter; with God's help, I will make it happen!</t4719> <t4720>That was Dr. Manette.</t4720> <t4721>When Mr. Jarvis Lorry saw the blazing eyes, the determined face, the calm and strong demeanor of a man whose life had been halted like a dead clock for so many years, now operating with a source of energy that had long been stagnant and useless, he believed his friend.</t4721>
<t4722>The obstacles greater than what the doctor had ever faced must also yield to his will.</t4722> <t4723>While still maintaining his position as a doctor working with all kinds of people, imprisoned and free, rich and poor, good and bad, he used his personal influence very wisely, so it wasn't long before he became the doctor for three prisoners at La Force. He could now assure Lucie that her husband was no longer in solitary confinement but was among the general population of prisoners; he met Charles weekly and brought back to her loving messages that Charles conveyed directly to him; sometimes Charles also sent her a letter (though not delivered by the doctor), but she was not allowed to write to her husband, because every prisoner was suspected of plotting, especially those of the exiled nobility who had many friends and constant connections abroad.</t4723>
<t4724>The new life of the doctor was certainly worrisome; but Mr. Lorry noticed that it still maintained a new sense of pride.</t4724> <t4725>No imperfection could affect that pride; the doctor's pride was natural and deserved, but Mr. Lorry still found it strange.</t4725> <t4726>Until then, the doctor knew that in the minds of his friend and daughter, his past imprisonment was associated with personal suffering, loss, and weakness.</t4726> <t4727>Now it was different, he knew that the hardships of the past had given him the strength to rescue Charles, making his loved ones appear weak and himself the one with authority.</t4727> <t4728>The previous relationship between him and Lucie had now reversed, only deep love and gratitude could invert that because he was only proud of repaying Lucie for all the devotion she had shown to her father. "It is indeed strange," Mr. Lorry thought to himself, in his wise and affectionate way, "but naturally right; so take charge, dear friend, just like that; no one can do it better than you."</t4728> <t4729>But despite Dr. Manette's utmost efforts and continuous striving to find freedom for Charles Darnay, or at least to get him a retrial, he could not resist the general tide of the times.</t4729> <t4730>A new era had begun; the King had been tried, convicted, and beheaded; the Republic of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death, had declared war against all of Europe, to win or die; the black flag flew day and night over the great towers of Notre Dame; three hundred thousand people called to rise against the earthly tyrants had stood up all over France, like warriors springing from dragon's teeth, from mountains to plains, on rocks and silt, under the bright southern sky and the northern cloudy dome, through forests and jungles, in vineyards and olive groves, among stunted grass and barren cornfields, along the lush riverbanks and on the sandy coasts.</t4730> <t4731>How could the private desire of one person stand against the flood of the First Year of Liberty - a flood rising from the ground rather than pouring from the sky, and the gates of Heaven closed indifferently!</t4731> <t4732>Relentless, merciless, without peace, without hesitation or interruption, regardless of the passage of time.</t4732> <t4733>Though night and day alternated regularly as before, morning and evening followed as ever, time no longer existed.</t4733> <t4734>The concept of time was lost in the fierce fever of a delirious nation.</t4734> <t4735>At times, to break the unusual silence of the capital, the executioner showed the people the head of the King - and now, it seemed no different, the executioner displayed the head of the beautiful Queen, who had spent eight miserable months in prison, her hair turned white.</t4735>
<t4736>And considering the many conflicting laws in every trial like that, time drags on while reality rushes by.</t4736> <t4737>A Revolutionary Tribunal in the capital, along with forty or fifty thousand Revolutionary Committees across the country; a law of suspicion threatening the freedom and lives of everyone, causing any decent and innocent individual to be condemned by the wicked and guilty; prisons overflowing with people who have committed no crime and have not been tried; these things have become the established and imposed order, and although they have only occurred for a few weeks, it feels as if they have been unchangeable for centuries.</t4737> <t4738>Above all, a figure increasingly familiar as if it had stood before our eyes since time immemorial: the sharp figure named La Guillotine: the guillotine.</t4738>
<t4739>The guillotine had become a common subject of jokes; it was the best cure for headaches; it was something that surely prevented gray hair, it was the dye that pinkened the skin, it was the National Razor Blade that ensured a cleaner shave for those who kissed La Guillotine, stuck their heads through the small window, and sneezed into the sack attached in front.</t4739> <t4740>The guillotine is the symbol of the rebirth of mankind.</t4740> <t4741>The guillotine replaced the Cross. Guillotine icons were worn on the chest where the Cross had been discarded, and people bowed their heads in worship of the guillotine when the Cross had been renounced.</t4741>
<t4742>The guillotine had beheaded so many people that it and the ground around it were soaked with the stench of blood.</t4742> <t4743>It was dismantled like a toy puzzle by little devils and reassembled when needed.</t4743> <t4744>It silenced the orators, brought down the powerful, and destroyed the good.</t4744> <t4745>In just twenty-two minutes one morning, it beheaded twenty-two notable individuals - twenty-one living and one already dead.</t4745> <t4746>The executioner who carried out this series of executions was nicknamed after the strongman Samson from the Old Testament; but with the guillotine as his weapon, this executioner was stronger than Samson, more blind than Samson, and daily brought down many temples of God.</t4746>
<t4747>Amidst that horrifying scene and the encompassing threats, Dr. Manette calmly walked, confident in his abilities, cautiously pursuing his goal, always firmly believing that he would eventually save Lucie's husband.</t4747> <t4748>However, time passed quickly, tumultuously, and fiercely; in a flash, Charles had been imprisoned for one year and three months while the doctor remained calm and confident as ever.</t4748> <t4749>In December of that year, the Revolution had become so brutal and insane that the southern rivers were strewn with the bodies of those barbarically drowned at night and the corpses of prisoners shot en masse under the winter sun.</t4749> <t4750>Nevertheless, the doctor still calmly walked amidst the horror.</t4750>
<t4751>Silent, kind, always relied upon in hospitals and prisons, using his expertise to heal without discriminating between victim and murderer, he stood apart from violence.</t4751> <t4752>While treating patients, his demeanor and the story of his imprisonment in the Bastille gave him a unique position.</t4752> <t4753>He was neither doubted nor questioned, as if he had truly come back to life from the dead more than eighteen years ago, or was a ghost wandering among the living.</t4753>
<t4754>5.</t4754> <t4755>The sawyer</t4755>
<t4756>One year and three months.</t4756> <t4757>During that entire time, Lucie lived in constant fear, minute by minute, hour by hour, not knowing if La Guillotine would behead her husband the next day.</t4757>
<t4758>Every day, on the cobblestone roads, the jolting rickshaws occasionally pass by, carrying people who have been sentenced.</t4758> <t4759>Beautiful girls; radiant women with black hair, brown hair, silver hair; young men; robust and elderly men; nobility and peasantry; all are the blood wine offered to her</t4759> <t4760>La Guillotine, brought out from the dark dungeons of the ghastly prisons, transported from all directions to quench her insatiable thirst. Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death - how easily the final goal is bestowed, oh La Guillotine! If this sudden calamity of Lucie and the whirling wheel of time had left her bewildered, seemingly hopeless for the day her husband would be free, then many others in her situation would have to resign themselves to the same fate.</t4760> <t4761>But from the moment Lucie embraced her father's white head in her arms in the attic of the Saint Antoine district, she remained devoted to her duty.</t4761> <t4762>Now, in this challenging adversity, her silent dedication and determination have only grown stronger.</t4762>
<t4763>As soon as they had settled into their new home and Mr. Manette had begun his regular work as a doctor, Lucie organized this small family just as she had when the whole family was reunited before.</t4763> <t4764>Everything was orderly and on schedule.</t4764> <t4765>As usual, she taught little Lucie just as she did when the family was still in England. To deceive herself into believing that the family would soon be reunited, she used many little tricks, such as setting aside Charles's books and chair as if he were about to return soon.</t4765> <t4766>Only such arrangements and the solemn nightly prayers for the unfortunate souls in prison under the shadow of death - especially Charles - could alleviate the heavy worry in her heart.</t4766>
<t4767>Her appearance had not changed much.</t4767> <t4768>The dark, simple dresses, almost like mourning clothes, that she and her mother wore were just as neat and well-made as the bright outfits from the happy times before.</t4768> <t4769>She was paler, the familiar furrow of concentration now always present on her face; otherwise, she remained beautiful and graceful.</t4769> <t4770>Sometimes, when kissing her father goodnight, she would burst into tears that she had held back during the day and exclaim that her father was her only support under this vast sky.</t4770> <t4771>Mr. Manette always replied firmly: "Nothing can happen to Charles that I do not know about, and I am certain that I will save your husband, Lucie."</t4771>
<t4772>Life had just stabilized for a few weeks when one evening, her father came home and said: −</t4772> <t4773>My dear, in the prison, there is a window on a high floor, where Charles can occasionally get to at three in the afternoon.</t4773> <t4774>If your husband can get up there; this depends on many uncertain factors; Charles might be able to see you on the street below, he thinks, if you stand in a spot that I will show you.</t4774> <t4775>But you will not be able to see Charles, my poor daughter, and even if you could see him, it would not be safe for you to signal to Charles.</t4775>
<t4776>− Oh, please show me that place, Father, and I will go there every day.</t4776>
<t4777>Since that day, regardless of rain or shine, Lucie stood at that spot for two hours.</t4777> <t4778>When the clock struck two, she was already there, and only at four did she reluctantly return home.</t4778> <t4779>When the weather was not too wet or harsh, she brought her child along; other times she went alone; but she never missed a day.</t4779>
<t4780>That spot was located right in a filthy dark corner of a winding small road.</t4780> <t4781>The shabby house of the woodcutter who specialized in splitting wood for firewood was the only house at that corner; the rest were just long stretches of walls.</t4781>
<t4782>Lucie had been there for three days when the woodcutter noticed her.</t4782>
<t4783>Hello, female Citizen.</t4783>
<t4784>Hello, Citizen.</t4784>
<t4785>That form of address is now a mandatory rule.</t4785> <t4786>It had formed some time ago voluntarily among the more enthusiastic patriots; but later it became a general regulation.</t4786>
<t4787>− Here again, Citizeness? −</t4787> <t4788>Well, you see, Citizen! The sawyer was a short man accustomed to exaggerated gestures (he used to be a road worker). He glanced towards the prison, pointed, then held up ten fingers in front of his face as if they were bars, and humorously pretended to peer through them.</t4788>
<t4789>− But that's not my business, - he said.</t4789> <t4790>And continued sawing wood. The next day he waited for Lucie, and as soon as she arrived, he started a conversation.</t4790>
<t4791>− What? Walking again, Citizeness? −</t4791> <t4792>Yes, Citizen.</t4792>
<t4793>− Ah! Another child! This is your mother, isn't it, little Citizen? −</t4793> <t4794>Can I speak, mom? - Little Lucie whispered, snuggling close to her mother.</t4794>
<t4795>− Okay, my dear.</t4795>
<t4796>− Yes, sir Citizen.</t4796>
<t4797>− Ah! But that is not my business.</t4797> <t4798>My business is to work.</t4798>
<t4799>Look at my saw! I call it Little Guillotine.</t4799> <t4800>La, la, la; La, la, la! And his head falls! A short piece of wood fell down while he was talking and sawing, then he threw the piece of wood into the basket.</t4800>
<t4801>− I call myself the Samson of the woodchopper.</t4801> <t4802>Look here! Chop, chop, chop; Chop, chop, chop! And her head falls! Now for the child.</t4802> <t4803>Chop, chop; Chop, chop!</t4803> <t4804>And its head falls.</t4804> <t4805>The whole family! Lucie shuddered as he threw two more logs into the basket, but she couldn't avoid the woodcutter while he was working.</t4805> <t4806>Since then, to avoid his ill-will, she always initiated conversation with him first and often sent him some money for drinks, which he readily accepted.</t4806>
<t4807>He was a curious man, and often Lucie would forget about him as she gazed at the roof and the barred windows of the prison, her mind on her husband, only to suddenly realize that he was watching her, kneeling on the carpenter's bench but with his saw no longer working.</t4807> <t4808>"But that's none of my business!" he would often say at such times, then hastily return to his sawing.</t4808>
<t4809>In all weather conditions, whether it was the freezing snow of winter or the cold winds of spring, whether the scorching heat of summer or the drizzle of autumn, and then back to the freezing snow of winter, Lucie would stand there for two hours every day; each day when she left, she would send a kiss towards the prison wall.</t4809> <t4810>About five or six times, Charles would see her once (she heard her father say so); sometimes two or three times in a row; sometimes it would take one or two weeks before he could see her again.</t4810> <t4811>As long as her husband had the chance to see her, that was enough, and for that chance, she was willing to stand there all day, seven days a week.</t4811>
<t4812>She kept coming to that corner regularly until December, while her father calmly walked through the scene of horror.</t4812> <t4813>On a lightly snowy afternoon, she came to her usual spot again.</t4813> <t4814>That day was a chaotic celebration.</t4814> <t4815>On her way there, she saw many houses decorated with small spears, topped with tiny red hats; there were also tricolor ribbons and the familiar slogan "The Indivisible Republic of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death!" - the letters also bore the three favored colors.</t4815>
<t4816>The shabby shop of the small sawyer was so tiny that there wasn't enough space to write the entire slogan.</t4816> <t4817>He had someone hastily write it on the door, and this person struggled to fit in the final word "Death."</t4817> <t4818>On the roof, he erected a spear with a hat on it, as every good Citizen should, and in the window, he displayed his saw with the inscription "Little Saint Guillotine" - because by that time, the sharp lady had been canonized by the people.</t4818> <t4819>His shop was closed and he had gone somewhere; seeing this, Lucie felt relieved to be standing alone.</t4819>
<t4820>But he was not far away, because right after that, Lucie became terrified when she heard the noisy footsteps and the shouting voices approaching.</t4820> <t4821>Just a moment later, a crowd of people passed by the corner near the prison, with the woodcutter holding the hand of the Goddess of Vengeance in the middle.</t4821>
<t4822>The crowd, which must have been up to five hundred people, was dancing enthusiastically like five thousand demons. There was no other music except for their singing and shouting.</t4822> <t4823>They danced to their favorite Revolutionary song, maintaining a fierce rhythm as if they were all grinding their teeth in unison.</t4823> <t4824>Men danced with women; women danced with each other; men danced with each other; they danced with anyone they happened to pair up with.</t4824> <t4825>At first, they were just a whirlwind of tattered red hats and ragged coats; but as they flooded this corner and began dancing around Lucie, some of them went wild like terrifying ghosts.</t4825> <t4826>They advanced, retreated, clapped each other's hands, grabbed each other's heads, spun alone, seized anyone, and the pairs spun together until many collapsed.</t4826> <t4827>Those who did not fall grabbed each other's hands to form a circle and spun around, then the circle broke into smaller circles of two or four people, and these circles kept spinning until they all suddenly stopped, started again, clapped, grabbed, separated, then reversed the direction of the spin, and all spun in the opposite direction.</t4827> <t4828>Suddenly, they stopped, rested, started again, formed lines that took up the entire width of the street, then, with heads bowed low and hands raised high, they ran off while screaming.</t4828> <t4829>No battle scene was half as terrifying as this dance.</t4829> <t4830>It was entirely a corrupt amusement - an innocent game turned malicious - a healthy pastime turned into something that boiled the blood with anger, paralyzed the mind, and froze the heart.</t4830>
<t4831>If any movements revealed a bit of beauty, the horror increased all the more as everything that was once good now became distorted and misguided.</t4831>
<t4832>The breasts of young girls exposed in dance, or their pretty, innocent heads frenzied with the rhythm, their nimble feet lifted high in this blood-soaked mud, these are the epitomes of a chaotic era.</t4832>
<t4833>That is the Carmagnole dance.</t4833> <t4834>While the crowd passed by, leaving Lucie terrified and trembling in front of the woodcutter's house, light, gentle snowflakes fell, softly covering the ground as if nothing had happened.</t4834>
<t4835>− Oh! Father! - She lowered her hands that were covering her face and saw her father standing in front of her.</t4835> <t4836>- The scene is truly horrifying, brutal! −</t4836> <t4837>I know, my dear, I know.</t4837> <t4838>I have seen it many times.</t4838> <t4839>Don't panic!</t4839> <t4840>No one will harm you.</t4840>
<t4841>− I'm not afraid for myself, Father.</t4841> <t4842>But when I think about my husband being at the mercy of these people...</t4842>
<t4843>− Soon, no one will have the power of life and death over Charles anymore.</t4843>
<t4844>When your father came here, your husband was going up to that window, and your father came to tell you.</t4844> <t4845>There is no one else watching here.</t4845> <t4846>You can send a kiss towards the highest sloping roof.</t4846>
<t4847>− I will do it right away, father, and send my soul as well! −</t4847> <t4848>You cannot see Charles, can you, my poor daughter.</t4848>
<t4849>− No, father, - Lucie said while crying full of longing as she sent a kiss with the wind, - I don't see.</t4849>
<t4850>Footsteps on the snow.</t4850> <t4851>Madame Defarge.</t4851>
<t4852>− Hello, female Citizen, - said the doctor.</t4852>
<t4853>− Hello, Citizen. - The greeting passed by, just like that. Mrs. Defarge left, like a shadow on the white snow.</t4853>
<t4854>− Now, I'll take you home, my dear. For Charles' sake, be cheerful and brave as you leave this place.</t4854> <t4855>Good job, - the father and daughter left that corner of the street.</t4855> <t4856>- It won't be in vain.</t4856> <t4857>Tomorrow, Charles will be called to trial.</t4857>
<t4858>− Tomorrow! −</t4858> <t4859>There is no more time to hesitate.</t4859> <t4860>I have prepared thoroughly, but many things need to be guarded against; we must be cautious until Charles actually goes to trial.</t4860> <t4861>Your husband has not yet received the notice, but I know that tomorrow Charles will be transferred to the Conciergerie prison to await trial; I have timely information.</t4861> <t4862>Are you not afraid? −</t4862> <t4863>I trust you, - Lucie could not speak.</t4863>
<t4864>− You must trust your father completely.</t4864> <t4865>Your long wait is almost over; in just a few hours, Charles will be back with you; I have done everything to protect your husband.</t4865> <t4866>Now I must go see Mr. Lorry.</t4866>
<t4867>He stopped walking.</t4867> <t4868>The sound of a creaking wheel could be heard in the distance.</t4868> <t4869>Both father and son understood all too well the meaning of that sound.</t4869> <t4870>One. Two. Three. Three carts loaded with a terrifying tribute for La Guillotine were crossing the snow, which lay silent and dreadful.</t4870>
<t4871>− We must meet Lorry, - the doctor repeated and then led Lucie in another direction.</t4871>
<t4872>The faithful old man maintained the job that had been entrusted to him; he never left the bank.</t4872> <t4873>He and his books were always needed when it came to confiscated and nationalized assets.</t4873> <t4874>He did everything he could to preserve the assets for the owners.</t4874> <t4875>No one in this world could be more reliable than Mr. Lorry in protecting the assets entrusted to Tellson's Bank and keeping silent.</t4875>
<t4876>The sky turned a gloomy shade of yellow and red, with mist rising from the Seine River, heralding the approach of night.</t4876> <t4877>It was already dark when the father and son arrived at the bank.</t4877> <t4878>The once magnificent mansion of the Lord was now completely ruined and desolate.</t4878> <t4879>Above a pile of ashes in the yard was a banner bearing the words: The United Indivisible Republic of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death!</t4879> <t4880>Who is with Mr. Lorry?</t4880> <t4881>The owner of the coat draped over the chair, whose face is unseen?</t4881> <t4882>Who is the person Mr. Lorry paused his conversation to go outside, anxious and astonished, to embrace his beloved niece Lucie? Who is the person Mr. Lorry, raising his voice towards the door just exited, repeated the words he had just heard Lucie hesitantly say?</t4882> <t4883>Mr. Lorry exclaimed: − Transferred to the Conciergerie prison tomorrow awaiting trial?</t4883>
<t4884>6.</t4884> <t4885>Success</t4885>
<t4886>The terrifying court of five judges, a prosecutor, and a jury that decides daily trials.</t4886> <t4887>The trial list is issued every evening and read to the prisoners by the wardens in various prisons.</t4887> <t4888>The wardens' familiar joke is: "Come here to hear the evening news, folks inside!"</t4888>
<t4889>− Charles Evrémonde, also known as Darnay! Thus, the final hour of the afternoon reading of the news had begun at La Force prison.</t4889>
<t4890>When a name was called, the person with that name stepped out to a place reserved for those whose fate was to be judged.</t4890> <t4891>Charles Evrémonde, also known as Darnay, understood this well because he had seen hundreds of people go to their deaths in that manner.</t4891>
<t4892>The plump jailer, wearing glasses to read the list, glanced over the prisoners to make sure Darnay had stepped out, then continued reading, pausing briefly after each name to glance up in the same manner.</t4892> <t4893>The list had twenty-three names but only twenty people stepped out; because one prisoner on the list had died in the cell without anyone remembering, and two others had gone to the guillotine without anyone remembering.</t4893> <t4894>The list was finished, in the vaulted room where Darnay first met the prisoners of his class on the night he was brought here.</t4894> <t4895>All those people had lost their lives in the massacre, none remained, every person he had cared about and then bid farewell to since that day had died on the scaffold.</t4895>
<t4896>Hasty yet tender farewells echoed, but the parting quickly ended.</t4896> <t4897>It was a daily occurrence, and the prisoners at La Force that night were busy preparing for some games of reward and punishment along with a small concert.</t4897> <t4898>They huddled together and shed tears at the barred windows, watching the number of people being called away; but the planned entertainments were short by twenty people who needed to be replaced, and time was pressing, nearing the hour to return to their cells, the time when the common rooms and corridors would be entrusted to the large dogs guarding throughout the night.</t4898> <t4899>The prisoners were not insensitive or indifferent; it was this prison environment that made them behave that way.</t4899> <t4900>This same environment also gave rise to another, more incomprehensible expression: the wild attitudes that surely led many to face the guillotine unnecessarily and lose their lives unjustly - it was not arrogance but a kind of epidemic as if it had spread from the madness of the populace.</t4900> <t4901>In the time of an epidemic, many of us silently suffer from this - a most dreadful temporary tendency to want to die from the epidemic.</t4901> <t4902>We all harbor strange desires within us, just waiting for the right conditions to erupt.</t4902>
<t4903>The road to the Conciergerie prison was short and dark; the night in the cold, rat-infested cells dragged on endlessly.</t4903> <t4904>The next day, fifteen prisoners were brought to trial before Charles Darnay was called.</t4904> <t4905>All fifteen were convicted, and the trials lasted a full hour and a half.</t4905>
<t4906>− Charles Evrémonde, also known as Darnay, - it is finally his turn.</t4906>
<t4907>The judges sat on the bench wearing hats adorned with feathers; but the courtroom was filled with tattered red hats bearing the tricolor emblem.</t4907> <t4908>Looking at the jury and the chaotic crowd, Darnay felt as if the normal order had been overturned, with criminals now judging the honest people.</t4908> <t4909>The lowest, most vicious, and most despicable class of a city teeming with the low, vicious, and despicable, was running the trial: commenting, applauding, objecting, anticipating, and urging the outcome, noisily and incessantly.</t4909> <t4910>Most of the men were armed with various weapons; some of the women held knives, some held swords, others ate and drank while watching the trial, and many were knitting.</t4910> <t4911>Among those knitting was one who never stopped with a distinctive knitting pattern.</t4911>
<t4912>The woman sat in the front row, next to a man whom Darnay had not seen since he arrived at the gates of Paris, but he clearly remembered him as Defarge. He noticed that a few times she whispered into Defarge's ear and seemed to be his wife; but what he noticed most about these two was that although they sat very close to him, they never looked in his direction.</t4912> <t4913>It seemed they were waiting for something very patiently, and did not take their eyes off the jury.</t4913> <t4914>Sitting below the Judge was Doctor Manette, in his usual simple attire.</t4914> <t4915>Darnay clearly saw that, apart from the officials, Mr. Manette and Mr. Lorry were the only two there dressed in ordinary clothes rather than the Carmagnole dance attire.</t4915>
<t4916>Charles Evrémonde, also known as Darnay, was accused by the prosecutor of being an exiled nobleman who must pay with his life for the Republic, according to the decree that orders the execution of all exiled nobles.</t4916> <t4917>This was regardless of the fact that the decree was issued after Darnay had already returned to France. He was in France, the decree was in effect; he was arrested in France, and he must lose his head.</t4917>
<t4918>− Off with his head! - The crowd shouted.</t4918> <t4919>- Enemy of the Republic! The judge rang the bell to silence the crowd and asked the prisoner if it was true that he had lived in England for many years.</t4919> <t4920>It was certainly true.</t4920>
<t4921>So, you are not an exiled nobleman?</t4921> <t4922>Then what do you call yourself?</t4922> <t4923>Not an exiled nobleman, Charles Darnay hopes, in the meaning and spirit of this law.</t4923>
<t4924>Why not?</t4924> <t4925>The judge wants to know.</t4925>
<t4926>Because Charles voluntarily renounced the title he detested, the status he despised, and left the country - before the term "exile" was used to refer to the nobility in the sense accepted by this court - to work for a living in England rather than living off the labor of the oppressed people in France.</t4926>
<t4927>Do you have any evidence for this?</t4927> <t4928>You named two witnesses: Theophile Gabelle, and Alexandre Manette.</t4928>
<t4929>But you have already started a family in England? The judge reminded.</t4929>
<t4930>Yes, but not with an English woman.</t4930>
<t4931>A French female citizen? Yes.</t4931> <t4932>Born in France.</t4932>
<t4933>Her name and her family's? Lucie Manette, the only daughter of Dr. Manette, the esteemed doctor currently present in the court.</t4933>
<t4934>This answer made the crowd quite cheerful.</t4934> <t4935>The entire courtroom echoed with cheers for the famous doctor.</t4935> <t4936>These people were so impulsive that some who just moments ago were glaring fiercely at the prisoner as if they wanted to drag him out and kill him, were now immediately in tears.</t4936>
<t4937>On this dangerous path, Charles Darnay followed the repeated instructions of Dr. Manette to the letter.</t4937> <t4938>The upcoming steps had also been meticulously guided by the doctor, and he was thoroughly prepared.</t4938>
<t4939>The judge asked why he returned to France at that time and not earlier?</t4939> <t4940>He replied that he did not return earlier simply because he had no means of livelihood in France, unless he relied on what he had abandoned; whereas in England, he lived by teaching the French language and literature. He returned at that time because of an urgent plea from a French Citizen, who said that his life would be in danger due to his absence.</t4940> <t4941>He returned to save this person's life and to face the truth, regardless of any risks to himself.</t4941> <t4942>Was this a crime against the Republic? "No!" The crowd enthusiastically shouted, and the judge's ringing of the bell to call for silence was in vain.</t4942> <t4943>The crowd continued to shout "No!" until they stopped on their own.</t4943>
<t4944>The judge asked for the name of that Citizen.</t4944> <t4945>The convict explained that the Citizen was the first witness he had mentioned.</t4945> <t4946>He also confidently referred to the letter from that Citizen, which had been taken from him at the gates of Paris, but he was sure it would be found in the files before the judge.</t4946>
<t4947>Dr. Manette had arranged for the letter to be there - he assured Charles that it would be there - and at this point, the letter was taken out and read.</t4947>
<t4948>Citizen Gabelle was called out to verify, and he confirmed the truth.</t4948> <t4949>Citizen Gabelle very delicately and politely implied that under the pressure of work that this Court had to deal with countless enemies of the Republic, he had almost been forgotten in the Abbaye prison—in fact, the patriotic Court had completely forgotten him—until three days ago; when he was called out for trial and the jury decided to release him, finding no grounds for charges since Citizen Evrémonde, also known as Darnay, had surrendered himself.</t4949>
<t4950>The next person to be questioned was Dr. Manette.</t4950> <t4951>His personal credibility and clear answers made a strong impression; however, he continued to testify that the defendant was his first friend when he was freed after a long period of imprisonment; that the defendant had stayed in England, always loyal and devoted to him and his daughter during their exile; that, not only was he not favored by the aristocratic government in England, but this defendant had actually been sentenced to death there for the crime of opposing England and sympathizing with the United States. While he presented these circumstances, with utmost caution and sincere, straightforward persuasiveness, the jury and the crowd watching the trial unanimously sympathized.</t4951>
<t4952>Finally, when he mentioned Mr. Lorry, an English gentleman currently present in the court, who, like him, had been a witness in the trial of this defendant in England and could corroborate his testimony, the jury declared they had heard enough and were ready to vote if the Judge agreed.</t4952>
<t4953>As each juror's vote was announced loudly, the crowd in the courtroom cheered and clapped.</t4953> <t4954>All the votes were in favor of the prisoner, and the Judge declared that Charles Darnay was free.</t4954>
<t4955>Then began a strange scene of the people in the court, similar to when a crowd sometimes wants to satisfy its own inconsistency or indulge in feelings of kindness and generosity, or perhaps it is a way for them to make amends for a past full of violent rage.</t4955> <t4956>At this moment, no one could determine the motive behind this strange scene; it could be a combination of all three motives, but the feelings of kindness and generosity were more overwhelming.</t4956> <t4957>As soon as the acquittal was announced, tears flowed abundantly like blood in other moments, both men and women rushed to Charles, embracing him with such fervent affection that he felt he might faint from exhaustion after a long period of miserable imprisonment; however, he knew very well that these same people, driven by the tides of events, would also rush at him with the same fervor to tear him apart and throw his remains into the street.</t4957>
<t4958>He temporarily escaped those tight embraces due to having to make way for other defendants to be tried.</t4958> <t4959>After that, five people were tried for the same crime of being enemies of the Republic, because they had not supported it in word or deed.</t4959> <t4960>Missing the opportunity to execute Charles Darnay, the court compensated itself and the nation with another opportunity that came so quickly that before he left the court, the five new defendants had been sentenced to death within twenty-four hours.</t4960> <t4961>The first person in this group informed him by raising one finger - the familiar prison sign for death - and all five exclaimed, “Long live the Republic!”.</t4961>
<t4962>In reality, there were no longer any spectators at the trial to prolong the judgment, because when Charles and Dr. Manette exited the gate, they saw a dense crowd that seemed to include every face he had seen in the courtroom - except for two faces he kept searching for but could not find.</t4962> <t4963>Seeing him come out, the crowd showered him with tears, embraces, and shouts, individually or in unison, to the point that the waters of the river next to the courthouse seemed to go mad just like the people on the shore.</t4963>
<t4964>They placed him on a large armchair in the midst of the crowd, the chair they had taken from the courtroom, or from a room or hallway of the courthouse.</t4964> <t4965>On the chair, they had draped a red flag, and behind the chair, they had fastened a spear with a red cap on top.</t4965> <t4966>Despite the doctor's pleas, the crowd still carried Charles on this triumphal chair, surrounded by a chaotic sea of red caps surging violently into his view with drifting faces, making him feel at times as if he were losing his mind and being taken on a cart to meet La Guillotine.</t4966>
<t4967>In that nightmare-like procession, the crowd carried Charles and embraced anyone they met on the road, pointing towards him.</t4967> <t4968>The snow-covered streets were filled with the red color of the Republic, as if stained with blood, as the winding crowd advanced, carrying Darnay all the way to the courtyard of the family house.</t4968> <t4969>Mr. Manette had gone ahead to inform Lucie, and when her husband stepped down to stand on the ground, she fainted in his arms.</t4969>
<t4970>While Charles held his wife tightly and turned her face towards him so that no one could see his tears and their lips met, a few people in the crowd began to dance.</t4970> <t4971>Immediately, the remaining people also joined in the dance, and the courtyard was filled with the Carmagnole dance. Then, they placed a girl from the crowd on an empty chair to carry her like a Goddess of Liberty, and the throng surged into the nearby streets, along the riverbank, across the bridge, and the Carmagnole dance attracted everyone, sweeping them away like a whirlwind.</t4971>
<t4972>After tightly holding Dr. Manette's hand while he stood proudly and triumphantly beside; after tightly holding Mr. Lorry's hand as he breathlessly ran to escape the Carmagnole flood; after kissing little Lucie who was lifted high to hug her father's neck; and after embracing the loyal and eager Miss Pross who was holding little Lucie; Charles held Lucie in his arms and guided his wife upstairs.</t4972>
<t4973>− Lucie!</t4973> <t4974>My love! I am safe.</t4974>
<t4975>− Oh dear Charles, let me kneel down and thank God as I have always prayed.</t4975>
<t4976>They sincerely bowed their heads in prayer.</t4976> <t4977>When Lucie had returned to his arms, Charles said to her: − It's all thanks to your father, my love.</t4977> <t4978>Throughout all of France, no one could have done what your father did for me.</t4978>
<t4979>She rested her head on her father's chest, just like in the old days, long ago when she had held him in her arms.</t4979> <t4980>Dr. Manette was very happy to be able to repay what Lucie had done for him, all the past suffering now compensated, he was proud of his strength: −</t4980> <t4981>“Don't be so weak, my dear,” he gently chided, “don't tremble so. I have saved Charles.”</t4981>
<t4982>7.</t4982> <t4983>The sound of knocking</t4983>
<t4984>"Father has saved Charles." It was not another dream where Charles often dreamed of being free; he had truly come back.</t4984> <t4985>However, Lucie still trembled in a vague but heavy fear.</t4985>
<t4986>The atmosphere around them was thick and gloomy, the people were bloodthirsty for revenge and impulsive, causing innocent people to constantly lose their lives due to vague suspicions and dark malice. How could Lucie forget that so many innocent people like her husband, who were loved by many, faced the same fragile fate as Charles every day.</t4986>
<t4987>With that thought, how could her heart ease this fear?</t4987> <t4988>The darkness of the winter evening had begun to fall, and even now those terrifying carriages were still rolling through the streets.</t4988> <t4989>Her mind thought of the people sitting in those carriages, imagining her husband among the convicted; she pressed closer to her present husband and trembled even more.</t4989>
<t4990>Her father, while encouraging his daughter, displayed a powerful hidden strength far surpassing Lucie's frailty - a truly wonderful image.</t4990> <t4991>No more the attic in the Saint Antoine district, no more the diligent shoemaking, no more Cell One Hundred and Five, North Tower! He had completed his self-imposed mission, kept his promise, and saved Charles.</t4991> <t4992>Everyone relied on him.</t4992>
<t4993>They lived very frugally; not only because it was the safest way of life, causing the least discomfort to the surrounding populace, but also because they were not wealthy; and Charles, during his imprisonment, had to spend a lot of money on poor meals, on guards, and on poorer fellow prisoners.</t4993> <t4994>Partly because of this, and partly to avoid harboring spies in their home, they had no servants; they only occasionally asked the male and female Citizens who guarded the outer yard to help with some tasks; Jerry (Mr. Lorry had almost entirely entrusted him to the Manette family) became their daily attendant and slept there every night.</t4994>
<t4995>According to the regulations of the Indivisible Unified Republic of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death, the name of every person living inside must be written clearly in a certain font size on the door or doorpost of every house, at a certain convenient height from the ground.</t4995> <t4996>Therefore, the name of Jerry Cruncher was also properly displayed on the doorpost of his house; and as the evening shadows fell, the owner of that name appeared, keeping an eye on the painter whom Dr. Manette had hired to add to that list the name of Charles Evrémonde, also known as Darnay.</t4996>
<t4997>In the fear and suspicion that enveloped that dark era, all harmless and normal ways of life changed.</t4997> <t4998>In the doctor's family, as in every other household, essential daily items were bought in the evening, in small quantities from various shops.</t4998> <t4999>Everyone wanted to avoid attracting attention, the less opportunity for others to be jealous and gossip, the better.</t4999>
<t5000>For the past few months, Miss Pross and Cruncher were entrusted with the task of shopping; Miss Pross carried the money; Cruncher carried the basket.</t5000> <t5001>Every evening when the street lamps were lit, they would go out on their mission and bring home such essential goods.</t5001> <t5002>Though Miss Pross had been in a French family for a very long time, she could have been as fluent in French as in English if she wanted to learn; but she had no such intention, so in the end, regarding that "gibberish" language (as she often called it), she was no better than Cruncher.</t5002> <t5003>Therefore, her way of shopping was to throw the name of an item at the shopkeeper's head, regardless of the masculine or feminine article preceding it, and if it wasn't the name of the item she wanted, she would look around for it, grab it, and hold onto it until the price was settled.</t5003> <t5004>She always bargained by holding up a few fingers to indicate her offer, always one finger less than the number the shopkeeper indicated, regardless of the price.</t5004>
<t5005>− Mr. Cruncher, - said Miss Pross, her eyes red from tears of joy, - if you are ready, then I am done as well.</t5005>
<t5006>Jerry hoarsely declared his request to serve Miss Pross.</t5006> <t5007>He had long since rid his fingers of the rusty smell, but nothing could tame his spiky hair.</t5007>
<t5008>− We need to buy so many things, - said Miss Pross, - and we have so little time.</t5008> <t5009>We also need to buy wine.</t5009> <t5010>Everywhere we buy wine, we encounter Red Caps toasting.</t5010>
<t5011>− For you, I think it doesn't matter what you're drinking to celebrate, - Jerry retorted, - whether they're toasting to you or to an old brain.</t5011>
<t5012>− Which old man? - Miss Pross asked.</t5012>
<t5013>− That Satan, - Cruncher stammered to explain.</t5013>
<t5014>− Ah! - Miss Pross said. - But with those people, no explanation is needed to understand.</t5014> <t5015>They are all about darkness, murder, and destruction.</t5015>
<t5016>− Shh, watch your words! - Lucie exclaimed.</t5016>
<t5017>− Yes, yes, yes, I will be careful, - said Miss Pross, - but we can speak privately that I hope not to see those people reeking of onions and tobacco hugging each other all over the streets anymore.</t5017> <t5018>Now, my dear mistress, you must sit by the fireplace without moving and wait for me to return! Take care of your husband who has just returned, and keep your beautiful head on your neck without turning it around like you are now, wait for me to come back!</t5018> <t5019>Doctor Manette, may I ask one question before I go? −</t5019> <t5020>I think you can ask freely.</t5020> <t5021>- The doctor replied with a smile.</t5021>
<t5022>− Oh heavens, don't mention the word freedom; we are tired of hearing it, - said Miss Pross.</t5022>
<t5023>− Shh, there she goes again! - Lucie scolded.</t5023>
<t5024>− All right, dear, - said Miss Pross, nodding emphatically, - in short, I am a subject of the kind King George the Third of England, - she curtsied when mentioning the king's name, - and therefore, my motto is "Crush the plot, thwart the scheme, hope of the people, God save the King*".</t5024>
<t5025>To show his loyalty, Cruncher also growled and repeated those words after Miss Pross, as if he were in a church.</t5025>
<t5026>− I am glad that you still have plenty of English blood in you, although I hope you don't catch a cold to the point of losing your voice, - Miss Pross said with satisfaction.</t5026> <t5027>- But the question is, Dr. Manette, is...</t5027>
<t5028>- This kind-hearted person always has a way of casually addressing everything that everyone else considers very serious, - ... do we have any prospects of leaving this place yet? −</t5028> <t5029>I'm afraid not, it's still dangerous for Charles.</t5029>
<t5030>− Oh my! - Miss Pross cheerfully suppressed a sigh while glancing at her beloved mistress's blonde hair by the fireplace.</t5030> <t5031>- Then we just have to be patient and wait, that's all.</t5031> <t5032>We have to hold our heads high and endure, as my brother Solomon often says.</t5032> <t5033>Let's go, Mr. Cruncher!...</t5033> <t5034>And you, my dear mistress, don't move! The two of them left, leaving Lucie, her husband, her father, and the child by the bright fireplace.</t5034> <t5035>The whole family was expecting Mr. Lorry to visit soon after finishing his work at the bank.</t5035> <t5036>Miss Pross had lit the lamp but placed it in the corner so they could enjoy the firelight undisturbed.</t5036> <t5037>Little Lucie sat beside her grandfather, her small hands holding his arm; and Dr. Manette, in an almost whispering voice, began to tell her the story of a wonderful fairy who broke through the prison walls to rescue a prisoner who had once helped her.</t5037> <t5038>All around was quiet and peaceful, and Lucie felt more at ease than ever before.</t5038>
<t5039>− What is that? - She suddenly exclaimed.</t5039>
<t5040>− My dear! - Her father said, pausing the story and holding Lucie's hand, Calm down.</t5040> <t5041>Why are you so startled! Even the smallest things... things that are insignificant... can make you jump!</t5041> <t5042>You, my daughter! −</t5042> <t5043>Father, I think that...</t5043> <t5044>- Lucie, pale-faced, stammered in defense, - ... I heard strange footsteps coming up the stairs.</t5044>
<t5045>− My dear, the staircase is as silent as a sheet.</t5045>
<t5046>As soon as he finished speaking, there was a loud knock on the door.</t5046>
<t5047>− Oh father, father.</t5047> <t5048>What is happening!</t5048> <t5049>Hide Charles.</t5049> <t5050>Save him! −</t5050> <t5051>My child, - the doctor said as he stood up, placing his hand on Lucie's shoulder, I have already saved Charles.</t5051> <t5052>Why so weak, my dear! Let me go open the door and see.</t5052>
<t5053>He held the lamp in his hand, crossed the two separating outer rooms, and opened the main door.</t5053> <t5054>The sound of heavy footsteps echoed on the floor, and four ruffians wearing red hats, armed with swords and pistols, entered the inner room.</t5054>
<t5055>− Citizen Evrémonde, also known as Darnay, - the first one to speak.</t5055>
<t5056>− Who are you looking for? - Darnay responded.</t5056>
<t5057>− I need to find.</t5057> <t5058>We need to find.</t5058> <t5059>I know you, Evrémonde; I saw you at the court today.</t5059> <t5060>You are now again a prisoner of the Republic.</t5060>
<t5061>Four strangers surrounded the place where Charles stood with his wife and children clinging tightly to him.</t5061>
<t5062>− Tell me why and how I am a prisoner? −</t5062> <t5063>You just need to know that you must return to the Conciergerie prison immediately, and tomorrow it will be clear.</t5063> <t5064>Tomorrow you will be retried.</t5064>
<t5065>Dr. Manette was stunned by this visit, standing as if turned to stone with the lamp in his hand.</t5065> <t5066>The words he just heard awakened him, and he set the lamp down and faced the speaker, gently grasping the edge of his red coat: −</t5066> <t5067>You say you know this person.</t5067> <t5068>Do you know me? −</t5068> <t5069>Yes, I know you, Citizen Doctor.</t5069>
<t5070>− We all know you, Citizen Doctor, - the other three also said.</t5070>
<t5071>Mr. Manette looked dazedly from one person to another, then after a moment of silence, he softly asked: −</t5071> <t5072>Then will you answer this question for me? Why is this happening? −</t5072> <t5073>Citizen doctor, - the first person reluctantly said, - this person has been accused by the Saint Antoine district.</t5073> <t5074>This citizen is from Saint Antoine, - he pointed to the second person in the group.</t5074>
<t5075>The person who was instructed nodded and added: −</t5075> <t5076>He was accused by Saint Antoine.</t5076>
<t5077>− For what crime? - The doctor asked.</t5077>
<t5078>− Citizen doctor, - the first person said, still in that reluctant tone, - please don't ask anymore.</t5078> <t5079>If the Republic demands that you sacrifice, you will surely be willing to sacrifice, if you are a good Citizen.</t5079> <t5080>The Republic is above all. The People are supreme.</t5080> <t5081>Evrémonde, let's go immediately.</t5081>
<t5082>− Just one word, - the doctor pleaded. - Please tell me who accused this person? −</t5082> <t5083>− It's against the law to say, - the first person replied, - but you can ask the people in the Saint Antoine area.</t5083>
<t5084>The doctor turned to look at the person.</t5084> <t5085>He fidgeted nervously, twirling his beard for a moment before saying: − Well! That is indeed against the law.</t5085> <t5086>But this person has been accused... and heavily charged... by both Citizen Defarge, male and female.</t5086> <t5087>And by another person.</t5087>
<t5088>− Who is it? −</t5088> <t5089>Are you still asking, Citizen Doctor? − Yes.</t5089>
<t5090>− Then you will have your answer tomorrow, - the man from the Saint Antoine district said with a strange expression. - For now, I will say no more!</t5090>
<t5091>8.</t5091> <t5092>The card game</t5092>
<t5093>Whether it was joy or disaster that had just occurred at home, Miss Pross weaved through the narrow streets and crossed the river via the Pont-Neuf bridge, calculating in her mind the essential items she needed to buy.</t5093> <t5094>Cruncher walked beside her, carrying the basket.</t5094> <t5095>The two of them kept glancing left and right past the shops, their eyes wary of any gathering crowds, and avoiding any groups of people who were speaking excitedly.</t5095> <t5096>That evening was bitterly cold and the river was shrouded in mist, the dazzling lights and the deafening sounds indicating the positions of the barges that had been transformed into workshops where workers were making guns for the army of the Republic.</t5096>
<t5097>Woe to anyone who dares to mock that army, or whose value does not match their rank within it!</t5097> <t5098>That person had better not grow a beard because the National Razor will cut their throat.</t5098>
<t5099>Having bought some miscellaneous food items and a bit of lamp oil, Miss Pross suddenly remembered she needed to buy wine.</t5099> <t5100>After looking into a few wine shops, she stopped in front of the sign "The Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity" not far from the National Palace - formerly the Tuileries Palace - which seemed to suit her taste.</t5100>
<t5101>This shop is less noisy than the other similar shops they had passed by, and although there were patriotic red hats, they were not as bright red as in other places.</t5101> <t5102>Upon asking Cruncher and seeing him agree, Miss Pross and her knight entered the shop Brutus de l’Antiquité.</t5102>
<t5103>These two strangers went straight to the counter, signaling that they wanted to buy what they needed; paying no attention to the dim light; to the people with pipes in their mouths playing limp cards and yellowed dominoes; to a half-naked worker, covered in soot, reading a newspaper aloud while others listened; to the weapons worn on their bodies or placed beside them, ready for action; to the two or three customers dressed in the popular short black coats with high shoulders of the time, dozing off at the table like bears or dogs.</t5103>
<t5104>While the two were waiting for the wine to be measured, a customer in the corner bid farewell to his friend, stood up, and walked out, facing Ms. Pross.</t5104> <t5105>As soon as she saw him, Ms. Pross clapped her hands and screamed.</t5105>
<t5106>Immediately, everyone in the café stood up abruptly.</t5106> <t5107>Everyone thought that someone had killed someone else due to a disagreement, as often seen.</t5107> <t5108>Everyone looked to see if anyone had fallen, but they only saw a man and a woman staring at each other intently; the man appeared to be completely French while the woman was clearly English.</t5108>
<t5109>The disappointing anticlimax caused every drinker in the Brutus de l’Antiquité tavern to loudly argue and chatter, but even if Miss Pross and her protector were listening, it was like water off a duck's back, they understood nothing.</t5109> <t5110>But in their astonishment, the two heard nothing at all.</t5110> <t5111>Because it must be said, not only was Miss Pross stunned and emotional, but Cruncher was also extremely surprised - for his own personal reasons.</t5111>
<t5112>− What happened? - The person who made Miss Pross scream lowered their voice and spoke hastily and irritably in English.</t5112>
<t5113>− Oh Solomon, my dear Solomon! - Miss Pross exclaimed while clapping her hands.</t5113> <t5114>It's been so many years since you disappeared, and now I see you here! − Don't call me Solomon.</t5114> <t5115>Do you want me to die or what? - The man said, looking stealthy and fearful.</t5115>
<t5116>− Oh, my dear, my dear! - Miss Pross burst into tears.</t5116> <t5117>- Have I ever treated you badly that you ask me such a cruel question? −</t5117> <t5118>Then stop wagging your tongue, - Solomon said.</t5118> <t5119>- Go outside if you want to talk to me.</t5119> <t5120>Pay for your drink, then go outside.</t5120>
<t5121>Who is this man? Miss Pross shook her head in despair at her brother's indifference to familial bonds and spoke through her tears: −</t5121> <t5122>Mr. Cruncher.</t5122>
<t5123>− Tell him to go outside immediately, - Solomon replied.</t5123> <t5124>- Does he think I'm a ghost or something?</t5124> <t5125>Just looking at Cruncher's face, it seemed so.</t5125> <t5126>But Cruncher didn't say a word, and Miss Pross, trying to hold back her tears, rummaged through her bag to pay for the drink.</t5126> <t5127>Meanwhile, Solomon turned to the other patrons in the Brutus de l’Antiquité tavern and offered a few explanations in French, causing everyone to return to their previous positions and concerns.</t5127>
<t5128>− Alright, - Solomon spoke as he stopped at a dark corner, - what do you want now? −</t5128> <t5129>You love me, but you treat me so terribly! - Sister Pross cried.</t5129> <t5130>- No greeting, no affection.</t5130>
<t5131>− There. Damn it! There, - Solomon said as he quickly brushed his lips against Miss Pross's lips.</t5131> <t5132>- Are you satisfied now?</t5132> <t5133>Miss Pross just shook her head and cried silently.</t5133>
<t5134>− If you think I'm surprised, I'm not surprised, - the younger brother said.</t5134> <t5135>- I know you're here; I know most people are here.</t5135>
<t5136>If you truly do not want my life to be in danger, although you might actually want that, then you go your way, and I'll go mine, the sooner the better.</t5136> <t5137>I am busy.</t5137> <t5138>I am now an official.</t5138>
<t5139>− My younger brother Solomon from England, - Sister Pross lamented while raising her tearful eyes to the sky, - a person who had the qualities to become someone important in his homeland, now works as an official for foreigners, and such foreigners at that! I would rather see my beloved younger brother lying dead in...</t5139>
<t5140>− See that! - The younger brother shouted, interrupting.</t5140> <t5141>- I knew it.</t5141> <t5142>You just want me to die.</t5142> <t5143>My own sister has made me a suspect.</t5143> <t5144>Right when I am advancing! −</t5144> <t5145>Oh my God! - Sister Pross exclaimed. - I'd rather never see you again, Solomon, even though I always love you and will always love you.</t5145> <t5146>Just say one kind word to me, and say that there is no anger or coldness between us, and I will not stop you anymore.</t5146>
<t5147>Poor Miss Pross!</t5147> <t5148>As if the coldness between the siblings was her fault.</t5148> <t5149>As if Mr. Lorry hadn't known the truth, that many years ago, in a quiet corner of Soho, this precious brother had spent all her money and then disappeared!</t5149> <t5150>Solomon was speaking some sentimental words, but with a sharp, condescending tone, as if the value and relative positions between the siblings had reversed (a common occurrence in this world), when Cruncher patted him on the shoulder and, in a hoarse voice, interrupted with an unexpected question: − Hey! May I ask you something?</t5150> <t5151>Is your name John Solomon, or Solomon John? The man turned to look at Cruncher with sudden suspicion.</t5151> <t5152>Cruncher hadn't uttered a word until now.</t5152>
<t5153>− Hey! Speak clearly now, - Cruncher continued.</t5153> <t5154>With that hoarse voice, even Cruncher couldn't speak clearly.</t5154> <t5155>–</t5155> <t5156>Are you John Solomon, or Solomon John? This lady calls you Solomon, so she must know, she's your sister after all.</t5156> <t5157>And I know you as John.</t5157> <t5158>Which one is the surname, which one is the first name?</t5158> <t5159>And then there's the surname Pross.</t5159> <t5160>That's not your surname in England.</t5160>
<t5161>− What do you mean? −</t5161> <t5162>Oh, I don't know exactly either, because I can't remember your last name from back then.</t5162>
<t5163>− No? − No.</t5163> <t5164>But I swear it's a surname with two syllables.</t5164>
<t5165>− Really? − Really.</t5165> <t5166>And the name has only one syllable.</t5166> <t5167>I know you. Back then, you were a spy... a witness at the Bailey Court.</t5167> <t5168>What was your last name back then, tell me? −</t5168> <t5169>Barsad, - another voice interjected.</t5169>
<t5170>− That's right! I bet a thousand pounds! - Jerry shouted.</t5170>
<t5171>The person who just spoke was Sydney Carton.</t5171> <t5172>He was standing next to Cruncher, with his hands hidden behind his back under the cloak of his traveling coat, looking as nonchalant as when he stood at the Old Bailey Criminal Court.</t5172>
<t5173>− Don't panic, dear Miss Pross.</t5173> <t5174>I went to see Mr. Lorry last night, much to his surprise; we agreed that I would not let anyone else know of my presence unless I was needed; I am here to have a little talk with your younger sister.</t5174> <t5175>I hope your sister has a better job than Mr. Barsad had before, and for your sake, I also hope Mr. Barsad is not a prisoner.</t5175>
<t5176>"Sheep" was the slang used by the prison guards at that time to refer to spies.</t5176> <t5177>The spy's face, already pale, turned even paler as he asked Carton how he dared...</t5177>
<t5178>− I will let you know, - said Sydney.</t5178> <t5179>- Mr. Barsad, I saw you coming out of the Conciergerie prison while I was looking at those walls more than an hour ago.</t5179> <t5180>You have a memorable face and I am good at remembering faces.</t5180> <t5181>Curious to see you there, and not unfamiliar with you, I had reason to associate you with the misfortune of my currently very unfortunate friend, so I followed you.</t5181> <t5182>I followed you closely straight into this tavern, sitting next to you.</t5182> <t5183>From your loose words and the public rumors of your admirers there, it was not difficult for me to deduce the nature of your work.</t5183> <t5184>And gradually my impulsive act of following you also had a specific purpose, Mr. Barsad.</t5184>
<t5185>− What is the purpose? - The spy asked.</t5185>
<t5186>−</t5186> <t5187>It would be troublesome and possibly dangerous to explain on the street.</t5187> <t5188>Please, could you allow a private conversation for a few minutes... in the office of Tellson's Bank, for instance? −</t5188> <t5189>Threatening, huh? − Oh! Did I say anything? −</t5189> <t5190>Then why should I go there? −</t5190> <t5191>Honestly, Mr. Barsad, I can't explain the reason if you don't go there.</t5191>
<t5192>"So you mean you won't talk, right?" - The spy hesitated.</t5192>
<t5193>− You understand me very well, Mr. Barsad.</t5193> <t5194>I won't say anything.</t5194>
<t5195>Carton's indifferent and nonchalant attitude greatly aided his quick thinking and cleverness with the plan he had in mind and with the person he needed to deal with.</t5195> <t5196>His experienced eye recognized this and he took full advantage of it.</t5196>
<t5197>− Hey, I already told you, - the spy directed a reproachful look towards the sister, - if there's any trouble with this matter, it's all your fault.</t5197>
<t5198>− Oh, come on, Mr. Barsad! - Sydney exclaimed. - Don't be ungrateful.</t5198>
<t5199>If it weren't for my utmost respect for your sister, I would have comfortably made the small proposal that I want both sides to be satisfied with.</t5199> <t5200>Will you go with me to the bank? −</t5200> <t5201>I will listen to what you need to say.</t5201> <t5202>Alright, I will go with you.</t5202>
<t5203>− I suggest that first we safely take your sister back to the corner of her street.</t5203> <t5204>Let me take your arm, Miss Pross.</t5204> <t5205>This city is not safe, and at this hour, letting you walk outside without protection; the person accompanying you knows Mr. Barsad, so I invite him to come with us to Mr. Lorry's place, ready?</t5205> <t5206>Let's go!</t5206> <t5207>Afterwards, Miss Pross would remember and remember for the rest of her life that, when she held Sydney's arm and looked up at his face, pleading with him not to harm Solomon, what she felt was the resolute strength in his arm and the fervor in his eyes, something not only contrary to his usual indifferent demeanor but also adding to his admirable qualities.</t5207> <t5208>But at that moment, Miss Pross was too worried about her brother, who was unworthy of her affection, combined with Sydney's sincere reassurances, so she did not pay much attention to that feeling.</t5208>
<t5209>They left Miss Pross at the corner of her street and then Carton led the way to Mr. Lorry's place, a few minutes' walk away. John Barsad, or Solomon Pross, walked beside him.</t5209>
<t5210>Mr. Lorry had just finished his dinner and was sitting in front of a small crackling fireplace - perhaps seeing in the flames an image of himself many years ago: a distinguished gentleman of Tellson's Bank gazing at the glowing embers in the fireplace of the Royal George Hotel in Dover.</t5210> <t5211>Hearing footsteps approaching, he turned around and was surprised to see a stranger.</t5211>
<t5212>− Miss Pross's brother, sir, - said Sydney.</t5212> <t5213>- Mr. Barsad.</t5213>
<t5214>− Barsad? - The distinguished old man repeated, - Barsad?</t5214> <t5215>I do remember that name... and the face.</t5215>
<t5216>− I told you that you have a memorable face, Mr. Barsad, - Carton said nonchalantly.</t5216> <t5217>- Please have a seat.</t5217>
<t5218>He also sat down and reminded Mr. Lorry with a word accompanied by a raised eyebrow: −</t5218> <t5219>The witness at the trial years ago.</t5219>
<t5220>Mr. Lorry immediately remembered and looked at the new guest with undisguised disgust.</t5220> <t5221>Sydney continued: "Miss Pross recognized Mr. Barsad as her beloved brother that you had heard about, and he confirmed this relationship."</t5221> <t5222>Now for the worse news.</t5222> <t5223>Darnay has been re-arrested.</t5223>
<t5224>Stunned, the old man exclaimed: −</t5224> <t5225>How can that be! Just two hours ago when I said goodbye, Darnay was safe and free, I intended to return to see him! −</t5225> <t5226>He has been arrested again anyway.</t5226> <t5227>When was he arrested, Mr. Barsad? −</t5227> <t5228>Right now, if not already.</t5228>
<t5229>− Mr. Barsad knows best, - Sydney said, - I heard Mr. Barsad tell another "sheep" in the tavern that he went to arrest Darnay.</t5229> <t5230>Barsad went with the escort team to the gate of Darnay's house and saw them go inside.</t5230> <t5231>His re-arrest is completely certain.</t5231>
<t5232>Through Sydney's expression, Mr. Lorry's keen eye immediately understood that there was no time to doubt any longer.</t5232> <t5233>Although confused, he still understood the need to keep a clear mind, so he calmed himself and listened attentively.</t5233>
<t5234>Sydney continued: −</t5234> <t5235>At this moment, I believe that the name and influence of Dr. Manette could be very useful for Darnay tomorrow...</t5235> <t5236>Mr. Barsad, you said that Darnay will be retried tomorrow, didn't you? −</t5236> <t5237>Yes, I believe so.</t5237>
<t5238>− ...</t5238> <t5239>It could be very useful for Darnay tomorrow as well as today.</t5239> <t5240>But it's not certain.</t5240> <t5241>Mr. Lorry, to be honest, I am also astonished that Dr. Manette was unable to prevent this arrest.</t5241>
<t5242>− Perhaps he didn't know beforehand, - Mr. Lorry said.</t5242>
<t5243>− But this situation is truly alarming when we know how closely he has been attached to his son-in-law.</t5243>
<t5244>− That's right, - Mr. Lorry admitted, his hand anxiously stroking his chin, his eyes anxiously looking at Carton.</t5244>
<t5245>− In short, - Sydney said, - this is a time of desperation, so we must play desperate games with desperate stakes.</t5245> <t5246>Let the doctor play the winning hand, and I will play the losing one.</t5246> <t5247>No life here is worth anything anymore.</t5247> <t5248>Anyone who is celebrated by the people today could be condemned tomorrow.</t5248> <t5249>Now the stake I am determined to win, in the worst case scenario, is a friend in the Conciergerie prison.</t5249> <t5250>And the friend I want to win is Mr. Barsad.</t5250>
<t5251>− You need good cards, sir, - the spy said.</t5251>
<t5252>− Let me see what cards I have...</t5252> <t5253>Mr. Lorry, you know how rude I can be; I wish you would give me some strong liquor.</t5253>
<t5254>The wine was brought out and he drank a full glass - another full glass - then pensively pushed the bottle aside.</t5254>
<t5255>− Mr. Barsad, - he continued in a tone as if he were examining the cards in his hand - the sheep of the prisons, the envoy of the Republican committees, sometimes a jailer, sometimes a prisoner, always a spy and informer, all the more valuable because he is English, as the English are generally less suspected of being easily bribed than the French, you represent your recruiter under a false name.</t5255> <t5256>That is a very good card.</t5256> <t5257>Mr. Barsad, currently working for the government of the French Republic, formerly worked for the aristocratic government of England, the enemy of France and freedom.</t5257> <t5258>That is an excellent card.</t5258> <t5259>In an age of suspicion like this country, it is easy to deduce that Mr. Barsad is still on the payroll of the aristocratic government of England, spying for Pitt*, the treacherous enemy of the Republic lurking within France, the dangerous English spy and traitor often spoken of but hard to detect.</t5259>
<t5260>That is the trump card.</t5260> <t5261>Have you seen my cards, Mr. Barsad? −</t5261> <t5262>I don't understand your game, - the spy replied, somewhat uneasy.</t5262>
<t5263>− I will play the ace which is to denounce Mr. Barsad to the nearest District Committee.</t5263> <t5264>Review your cards, Mr. Barsad, and see what you have.</t5264>
<t5265>Don't be hasty.</t5265>
<t5266>He pulled the bottle of wine closer, filled another glass, and drank it all.</t5266> <t5267>He saw that the spy was afraid he would get drunk and wanted to expose him immediately.</t5267> <t5268>He poured himself another full glass of wine and drank it.</t5268>
<t5269>− Take a good look at your card, Mr. Barsad.</t5269> <t5270>Take your time.</t5270>
<t5271>The card was weaker than he thought.</t5271> <t5272>Barsad saw the losing cards that Sydney Carton was unaware of.</t5272> <t5273>Having been expelled from his prestigious job in England after too many unsuccessful attempts at perjury - not because he was no longer needed there; England at that time, as now, boasted of its superiority in schemes and espionage - he knew that he had voluntarily crossed the English Channel to take up a job in France; initially, he lured and eavesdropped on expatriates there, and gradually began to lure and eavesdrop on the locals as well.</t5273> <t5274>He knew that under the overthrown regime, he had been a spy in the Saint Antoine area and Defarge's wine shop; he had been provided with information by the sharp-nosed police about Dr. Manette's imprisonment, release, and background.</t5274> <t5275>He had used that information to strike up a conversation with the Defarges and tried to exploit Madame Defarge but failed miserably.</t5275>
<t5276>He always shuddered when he remembered that while he was trying to strike up a conversation, that dreadful woman had looked at him in a terrifying way, her fingers still deftly knitting.</t5276> <t5277>Since then, he had encountered her many times in the Saint Antoine district, always holding out a list knitted into the fabric and denouncing many people, victims who would surely meet their end at the guillotine.</t5277>
<t5278>He knew, just like many others recruited for the same job, that his life would never be safe; there was no way to escape; he would always be under the shadow of death; and despite having switched sides to serve this reigning terror, a single word could put him in danger.</t5278> <t5279>Once denounced, with the serious crimes he had just reviewed in his mind, he foresaw that the dreadful woman with a cruel personality, whom he had witnessed many times, would certainly bring out that deadly list to accuse him and extinguish his last chance of survival.</t5279> <t5280>Moreover, everyone living a secret life is easily panicked, and the cards in his hand were unlucky enough to prove his increasingly livid face due to rage.</t5280>
<t5281>− It seems you don't like your card, - Sydney said very calmly.</t5281> <t5282>- Are you going to play? −</t5282> <t5283>I think, sir, - the despicable spy humbly turned to Mr. Lorry, - I earnestly implore this venerable and generous gentleman to speak to that other gentleman, who is much younger than you, and ask him not to demean himself by playing the trump card he mentioned.</t5283> <t5284>I confess I am a spy, and this is a profession considered to be dishonorable... although someone has to do this job; but this gentleman is not a spy, why should he demean himself like spies do? −</t5284> <t5285>I play my ace, Mr. Barsad, - Carton said without waiting for Mr. Lorry to respond, and looking at the clock, - without hesitation, in just a few minutes.</t5285>
<t5286>− Gentlemen, - the spy always tried to draw Mr. Lorry into the conversation, - I keep hoping that because you both respect my sister...</t5286>
<t5287>− The best way for me to show respect to your sister is that I will ultimately help her be free from her brother, - Sydney Carton said.</t5287>
<t5288>− Is there no other way, sir? −</t5288> <t5289>I have made up my mind.</t5289>
<t5290>In stark contrast to his ragged exterior, and perhaps to his usual behavior, the detective's courteous demeanor had lost its effect in the face of Carton's enigmatic attitude - a man who was a mystery even to those more intelligent and virtuous than Barsad.</t5290> <t5291>While he was still bewildered, Carton continued in the manner of someone contemplating his next move: −</t5291> <t5292>And indeed, now that I think about it, I realize I have an even better card to play that I haven't mentioned yet.</t5292> <t5293>My friend...</t5293> <t5294>the one who claims to be a sheep grazing in this country's prison; who is that? −</t5294> <t5295>A Frenchman. You wouldn't know him, - the detective quickly replied.</t5295>
<t5296>− The Frenchman? - Carton repeated, looking pensive, as if he wasn't paying attention to Barsad but was speaking to himself. - Ah, it could be him.</t5296>
<t5297>− It's him, I assure you, - the spy said, - though this matter is not important.</t5297>
<t5298>− Even though this matter is not important, - Carton repeated mechanically as before, -... even though this matter is not important...</t5298> <t5299>No, not important.</t5299> <t5300>No.</t5300> <t5301>But I remember that face.</t5301>
<t5302>− I don't think so.</t5302> <t5303>I'm sure it's not.</t5303> <t5304>No way, - the spy said.</t5304>
<t5305>− No... way... - Sydney Carton murmured as if reminiscing, his hand fondling the glass of wine (luckily it was a small glass). - No... way.</t5305>
<t5306>Speaks French well. But still with a foreign accent, right? − A provincial accent, - the spy said.</t5306>
<t5307>− No.</t5307> <t5308>Foreigner! - Carton exclaimed, slamming the table as he suddenly remembered. - Cly! Disguised, but still a person.</t5308> <t5309>We saw him standing in front of us at the Old Bailey Court.</t5309>
<t5310>− There you go, you jumped to conclusions too quickly, sir, - Barsad said with a smile that made his hooked nose seem to bend to one side, - in this matter, you have given me the advantage.</t5310> <t5311>Cly, whom I admit without hesitation was my friend in the past; but he has been dead for many years now.</t5311> <t5312>I took care of him when he was sick and dying.</t5312> <t5313>He was buried in London in the cemetery of Saint Pancras Church.</t5313> <t5314>At that time, the common folk hated him so much that I couldn’t attend his funeral, but I personally helped place him in the coffin.</t5314>
<t5315>At that moment, from where he was sitting, Mr. Lorry suddenly noticed the shadow of a goblin prominently on the wall.</t5315> <t5316>Tracing where the shadow originated from, he realized that the unusually upright shadow was actually Cruncher's head with his hair standing on end.</t5316>
<t5317>− We must be thoughtful and fair, - the spy said.</t5317> <t5318>To prove that you are mistaken and that your assumption is unfounded, I will show you Cly's burial certificate, which I happen to have in my notebook all this time, - his hand hastily pulled out the notebook and opened it.</t5318> <t5319>Here it is.</t5319> <t5320>Ah, take a look, take a look!</t5320> <t5321>You can pick it up and examine it; it's not a forgery.</t5321>
<t5322>At this moment, Mr. Lorry saw the shadow on the wall lengthen, and Cruncher stood up and walked over.</t5322> <t5323>His hair now stood up like spikes, each strand stiff and fierce as if anger wanted to shoot out of his head.</t5323>
<t5324>The spy did not see that Cruncher was standing beside him.</t5324> <t5325>Like a ghostly law enforcer, Cruncher grabbed Barsad's shoulder and said: − So it turns out that name Roger Cly.</t5325> <t5326>Hey you, did you put him in the coffin? −</t5326> <t5327>Who else but me.</t5327>
<t5328>− So who took him out of the coffin? −</t5328> <t5329>What do you mean? - Barsad leaned back in his chair, stammering.</t5329>
<t5330>− What I mean is, - Cruncher said, - is that he was not in the coffin at all.</t5330>
<t5331>No! Not at all!</t5331> <t5332>If he's in there, you can cut off my head.</t5332>
<t5333>The spy darted his eyes between the two noble people, both of whom were looking at Jerry in astonishment, unable to utter a word.</t5333> <t5334>Jerry continued: − I'm telling you, in that coffin, you only buried dirt and rocks.</t5334> <t5335>Don't tell me you actually buried Cly. That's a scam.</t5335> <t5336>Two others and I have known for a long time.</t5336>
<t5337>− How do you know? − That doesn't matter.</t5337> <t5338>- Cruncher growled. - By God! You are my old grudge, for daring to deceive an honest working man with such shameful tricks! If I could strangle you to death, I would do it even if it cost me half a Guinea.</t5338>
<t5339>Sydney Carton and Mr. Lorry were both astonished by this turn of events.</t5339> <t5340>Hearing this, both of them asked Cruncher to calm down and explain clearly.</t5340>
<t5341>− Another time, sir, - he replied evasively, - it's not convenient to explain now.</t5341> <t5342>And I dare say this fellow knows full well that Cly was never in that coffin.</t5342> <t5343>If he dares to say that again, just one more time, I'd gladly pay half a guinea to strangle him on the spot, - Cruncher continued his generous offer, - or I'll go out and report him.</t5343>
<t5344>− Hm! I see an additional opportunity, - Carton said.</t5344> <t5345>- I have another card to play, Mr. Barsad.</t5345> <t5346>In this crazy Paris, where everyone suspects everyone else, you cannot escape being denounced while you are in contact with another aristocratic spy of the same background as you, who also has the secret of faking his death and coming back to life!</t5346> <t5347>A conspiracy in the prison, by foreigners wanting to oppose the Republic.</t5347> <t5348>The sure-win card... the Guillotine card! Do you play? − No! - The spy replied.</t5348> <t5349>- I give up.</t5349> <t5350>I admit that the brutal crowd hates both of us so much that I had no choice but to risk drowning to escape from England, while Cly was hunted everywhere, so if he hadn't faked his death, he wouldn't have escaped.</t5350> <t5351>As for how this person knew about the fake death, I have no idea.</t5351>
<t5352>− You guys don't waste your time with this one, - Cruncher often retorted.</t5352> <t5353>- You guys don't need to waste your time paying attention to him.</t5353> <t5354>Look here!</t5354> <t5355>Just one more time! - Cruncher couldn't help but propose his boastful exchange, - I'd give up half a guinea to strangle you to death right now.</t5355>
<t5356>The prison sheep looked from Cruncher to Sydney Carton, then spoke more decisively: −</t5356> <t5357>It's time to lay everything out plainly.</t5357> <t5358>My shift is about to start and I can't stay much longer.</t5358> <t5359>You said you had a proposal; what is it?</t5359> <t5360>Well, demanding too much from me won't be of any use.</t5360> <t5361>Forcing me to do anything in my position that might risk my head, I'd rather risk refusing than agreeing.</t5361> <t5362>In short, the choice is mine.</t5362> <t5363>You mentioned desperation.</t5363> <t5364>We are all desperate here.</t5364> <t5365>Remember that!</t5365> <t5366>I could also betray you if I see fit, and I can lie under oath as well as anyone.</t5366> <t5367>Now, what do you want from me? −</t5367> <t5368>Not much.</t5368> <t5369>You are the warden at the Conciergerie, right? − I'm telling you plainly, there's no chance of escape from there, - the spy asserted.</t5369>
<t5370>− Why are you talking about something I didn't ask?</t5370> <t5371>Are you the jailer at the Conciergerie? −</t5371> <t5372>At times, I do that job.</t5372>
<t5373>− When you need to, can you do that? −</t5373> <t5374>I can come and go whenever I want.</t5374>
<t5375>Sydney Carton poured another glass of strong liquor, then slowly spilled it onto the hearth, watching the liquid drip until it was empty. He stood up and said:</t5375> <t5376>− We have been talking in front of these two because they also need to understand that the value of these cards is not just between you and me.</t5376> <t5377>Let's go into that dark room and have a final word in private.</t5377>
<t5378>9.</t5378> <t5379>Betting</t5379>
<t5380>While Sydney Carton and the prison sheep were in the dark room next door, talking so quietly that no sound could be heard, Mr. Lorry looked at Jerry with apprehension and suspicion.</t5380> <t5381>The way the "honest businessman" reacted to Mr. Lorry's gaze only increased the suspicion; Jerry fidgeted as if he had fifty feet and was constantly trying to balance himself on each one; he examined his nails with suspiciously intense focus; whenever he caught Mr. Lorry's eye, he would cough to bring his palm to his mouth out of politeness, but this only added to his appearance of concealment and lack of straightforwardness.</t5381>
<t5382>− Jerry, - Mr. Lorry said.</t5382> <t5383>- Come here.</t5383>
<t5384>Cruncher moved his shoulder forward, walking sideways towards him.</t5384>
<t5385>− What did you do before when you were both a messenger for the company and something else? After a moment of pondering, accompanied by a fixed stare at his boss, Cruncher came up with a creative answer: −</t5385> <t5386>Doing manual labor.</t5386>
<t5387>− I am very suspicious, - Mr. Lorry angrily waved his index finger in front of Cruncher, - daring to use the name and reputation of Tellson's Bank to cover up your vile illegal activities.</t5387> <t5388>If so, don't expect me to remain friendly with you when we return to England. If so, don't expect me to stay silent about your actions.</t5388> <t5389>Don't hope to exploit Tellson's Bank any further.</t5389>
<t5390>− Sir, - Cruncher pleaded nervously, - a nobleman like you, for whom I have had the fortune of doing odd jobs until now, please don't harm me in haste, even if it is true... I'm not saying that you are telling the truth, but let's suppose it is so.</t5390> <t5391>But you must reconsider that even if you are telling the truth, it's not just me involved.</t5391> <t5392>It's a matter of both sides.</t5392> <t5393>At this moment, there are doctors making a lot of money while an honest worker struggles to earn a few pennies...</t5393> <t5394>Pennies! No, they can't even earn half a penny...</t5394> <t5395>Half a penny! No, even earning a quarter of a penny is difficult...</t5395> <t5396>Those doctors borrow carriages and rush to Tellson's as fast as smoke or even faster, secretly winking at the worker...</t5396> <t5397>Well, that's also taking advantage of Tellson's, sir.</t5397> <t5398>You can't treat people differently based on their appearance.</t5398> <t5399>And then there's my wife, Mrs. Cruncher, not now but at least back in England and probably in the future too, she would just sit down and curse, so I couldn't do any business... always running into bad luck!</t5399> <t5400>At that time, the wives of those doctors didn't curse their husbands... they consumed everything!</t5400> <t5401>And if they did sit down, they would curse for more people to get sick so their husbands would have more work, is it wrong for me but right for them?</t5401> <t5402>Then there's the need to bribe the undertakers, the parish wardens, the gravediggers, the cemetery keepers, all of them are equally greedy, so how much can an honest worker make, even if it is true.</t5402> <t5403>Even if they earn a little, it's not enough to prosper, Mr. Lorry.</t5403> <t5404>It's not a pleasant job, sir; anyone who falls into that job would want to leave if they had the chance to change... the job you're talking about.</t5404>
<t5405>− Oh! - Mr. Lorry exclaimed, his voice somewhat softening. - You are truly terrible.</t5405>
<t5406>− So, sir, I beg you, - Cruncher still tried to say, - that matter, I will not speak of it...</t5406>
<t5407>− Don't beat around the bush anymore, - Mr. Lorry said.</t5407>
<t5408>− No, I will not do it anymore, sir, - Cruncher kept speaking according to his thoughts and habits. - I will not reveal... the matter I beg of you is this.</t5408> <t5409>Sitting on that chair, at the Temple gate, is my son, I have raised him to adulthood, he will run errands for you, work for you, do everything you command until death, if you wish.</t5409> <t5410>That matter, I will not speak of it, because I will not beat around the bush with you anymore, sir, please let that boy take his father's place, take care of his mother, please do not accuse his father... do not do that, sir... and please let his father go to work digging graves properly to make up for what he should not have dug... that matter, and I will perform the burial properly and decently from now on.</t5410> <t5411>That's it, Mr. Lorry, - Cruncher said while wiping his forehead, as a way of declaring that he had reached the end of his speech, - that is what I respectfully present to you.</t5411>
<t5412>With so many terrible things happening around like this, anyone who sees it must think carefully, oh my, just seeing so many citizens losing their heads is enough to know that the wages for porters have dropped drastically.</t5412> <t5413>And I also ask you to remember the recent matter, that matter, those things I said earlier to expose that guy, I helped Mr. Carton when I could have said nothing at all.</t5413>
<t5414>− At least this is true, - Mr. Lorry said. - Now don't say anything more.</t5414>
<t5415>Perhaps I would still be close to you, if you were worthy, and repented through actions... not words.</t5415> <t5416>I don't want to hear another word.</t5416>
<t5417>Cruncher tapped his forehead as Sydney Carton and the spy emerged from the dark room.</t5417>
<t5418>− Goodbye, Mr. Barsad, - Carton said.</t5418> <t5419>- Since we have agreed, you have nothing to fear from me anymore.</t5419>
<t5420>He sat down on the chair by the fireplace, facing Mr. Lorry as before.</t5420> <t5421>When only they were left, Mr. Lorry asked what he had done? −</t5421> <t5422>Not much.</t5422> <t5423>If something unfortunate happened to Darnay, I had ensured a way to see him once in prison.</t5423>
<t5424>Mr. Lorry's face darkened.</t5424>
<t5425>− I can only do this much. - Carton said.</t5425> <t5426>- Excessive demands would get this person sent to the guillotine, and as he himself said, if he were to be denounced, he would die just the same.</t5426> <t5427>Clearly, this is a weak point in my position.</t5427> <t5428>There's nothing else to be done.</t5428>
<t5429>− But the matter of meeting Darnay, - Mr. Lorry said, - if something unfortunate happens in court, it won't save him.</t5429>
<t5430>− I did not say that at all.</t5430>
<t5431>Mr. Lorry's eyes slowly turned towards the fire; the love he had for Lucie and the profound disappointment when Darnay was arrested again had left his eyes vacant; he was now an old man, recently having endured excessive worries, and tears streamed down his cheeks.</t5431>
<t5432>− You are a kind-hearted man and a sincere friend, - Carton said, changing his tone.</t5432> <t5433>- Please forgive me for seeing you so emotional.</t5433> <t5434>If you were my father, I could not sit by and watch my father cry without caring.</t5434> <t5435>I respect your suffering as if it were my own father's.</t5435> <t5436>But fortunately for you, I am not your son.</t5436>
<t5437>Even though he spoke the last sentence with the same indifferent attitude as before, his tone and emotions were still full of affection and respect to the extent that Mr. Lorry was completely surprised because he had never seen him express himself in such a way.</t5437>
<t5438>He extended his hand to Carton, and he gently grasped it.</t5438>
<t5439>− Returning to poor Darnay's matter, - Carton said. - Please do not let Lucie know about this exchange, or this agreement.</t5439> <t5440>She cannot possibly go to see Darnay.</t5440> <t5441>She might think that this is a plan so that in the worst case, he would be given a means to commit suicide before being taken to the guillotine.</t5441>
<t5442>Mr. Lorry did not think of that at all, and quickly glanced towards Carton to see if he really thought so.</t5442> <t5443>It seemed true; he returned Mr. Lorry's look and clearly understood the meaning.</t5443>
<t5444>− She can imagine a thousand things, - Carton said, - and each one only makes her more miserable.</t5444> <t5445>Don't tell her about me.</t5445> <t5446>As I told you when I first came here, it's best that I don't meet her.</t5446> <t5447>I can still do anything useful for Lucie within my ability without having to meet her.</t5447> <t5448>You're going to Lucie's house, aren't you? I hope so. She must be very desperate tonight.</t5448>
<t5449>− I'm going now, right away.</t5449>
<t5450>− Then I am very glad.</t5450> <t5451>She is extremely attached to and trusts you.</t5451>
<t5452>How does she look now, I wonder? −</t5452> <t5453>Worried and distressed, but very beautiful.</t5453>
<t5454>− Ah! A prolonged, sorrowful sound, like a sigh - almost like a sob.</t5454> <t5455>The utterance made Mr. Lorry attentively look at Carton's face, which was turned towards the firelight.</t5455> <t5456>The light, or the darkness (the old man couldn't determine), was swiftly passing over Carton's face like patches of light and shadow sweeping quickly over a hillside on a bright sunny day, and he lifted a foot to push a small burning log, causing it to tumble into the fireplace.</t5456> <t5457>He wore a white coat and high boots, which were in fashion: the firelight reflecting off his light-colored attire made him appear even more pale under his long, disheveled brown hair.</t5457> <t5458>His indifference to the fire was enough to prompt Mr. Lorry to utter a reminder; his boot was still placed on the glowing embers of the burning log as it crumbled under the weight of his foot.</t5458>
<t5459>− I forgot, - he said.</t5459>
<t5460>Mr. Lorry's eyes once again looked up at his face.</t5460> <t5461>Noticing the weariness that covered Carton's once delicate features, he immediately recalled the face of the prisoner still etched deeply in his mind.</t5461>
<t5462>− Has your work here almost finished? - Carton said as he turned to look at him.</t5462>
<t5463>− It's done.</t5463> <t5464>As I was telling you last night when Lucie came here suddenly, I finally finished what needed to be done here.</t5464> <t5465>I hope they will stay here in complete peace, then I will bid farewell to Paris.</t5465> <t5466>I have a pass.</t5466> <t5467>I am ready to leave.</t5467>
<t5468>Both were silent.</t5468>
<t5469>− You have a whole long life to look back on, don't you? - Carton said, thoughtfully.</t5469>
<t5470>− I am already seventy-eight years old.</t5470>
<t5471>− You have had a useful life, always stable and busy; trusted; respected; and admired.</t5471>
<t5472>− Since I became an adult, I have only known how to do business.</t5472> <t5473>In fact, I can say that I've been doing business since I was young.</t5473>
<t5474>− Look at you, at seventy-eight years old, and the company still needs you so much.</t5474> <t5475>How many people will remember you when you are gone! −</t5475> <t5476>An old, lonely bachelor, - Mr. Lorry replied, shaking his head.</t5476> <t5477>No one will mourn me.</t5477>
<t5478>− How can you say that?</t5478> <t5479>Wouldn't Lucie cry for you?</t5479> <t5480>And her child too? −</t5480> <t5481>Yes, yes, thank God. That's not exactly what I meant.</t5481>
<t5482>− That is something to be thankful to God for, isn't it? −</t5482> <t5483>Surely it is.</t5483>
<t5484>− If tonight, you can honestly say to your lonely heart, "no one has ever loved, cherished, been grateful to, or respected me; no one has shown me any affection; I haven't done anything good or useful for anyone to remember me by!", if so, then your seventy-eight years of life would be seventy-eight curses, wouldn't they? −</t5484> <t5485>That's right, Mr. Carton; I think so.</t5485>
<t5486>Sydney again looked towards the fireplace, and after a moment of silence he said: −</t5486> <t5487>I want to ask you...</t5487> <t5488>Your childhood must be a distant memory, right?</t5488> <t5489>The time when you sat on your mother's lap must be hazy?</t5489> <t5490>In response to his sudden tenderness, Mr. Lorry replied: −</t5490> <t5491>Twenty years ago, yes; but at this age, no.</t5491>
<t5492>Because, as I get closer to the final moment, I have completed the cycle, getting closer and closer to the starting point.</t5492> <t5493>It seems that this is how we slowly prepare for the end.</t5493> <t5494>Our hearts now tremble with many long-forgotten memories of the beautiful young mother from before; because we are now too old!...</t5494>
<t5495>And about many things related to that time, the time when the reality we call this world did not yet exist for us, and the mistakes within us had not yet become habits.</t5495>
<t5496>− I understand that feeling! - Carton exclaimed, his face flushed with excitement.</t5496> <t5497>- And does that make you feel better? −</t5497> <t5498>We hope so.</t5498>
<t5499>Carton ended the conversation by standing up and helping the old man put on his coat.</t5499>
<t5500>− Like you, you are still young, - Mr. Lorry returned to that topic.</t5500>
<t5501>− Yes, - Carton replied. - I'm not old yet, but my youth was not the kind that allows for a peaceful old age.</t5501> <t5502>That's enough about me.</t5502>
<t5503>− About me, it's the same, no need to say more, - Mr. Lorry replied.</t5503> <t5504>- Are you going out? −</t5504> <t5505>I will take you to Miss Lucie's gate.</t5505> <t5506>You know my habit of not being able to sit still.</t5506> <t5507>If I wander outside for a long time, don't worry; I will reappear in the morning.</t5507>
<t5508>Are you going to the court tomorrow? −</t5508> <t5509>Yes, unfortunately.</t5509>
<t5510>− I will come too, but I will just stand in the crowd.</t5510> <t5511>My secret agent will find a spot for me.</t5511> <t5512>Take my arm, sir.</t5512>
<t5513>Mr. Lorry followed, and they went downstairs and out to the street.</t5513> <t5514>In just a few minutes, they reached Mr. Lorry's destination.</t5514> <t5515>Carton left him there; but lingered a little distance away, then returned when the gate had closed and touched the gate.</t5515> <t5516>He had heard about her going to the prison every day.</t5516>
<t5517>− She went out from this place, - he said while looking around, - turned this way, and surely often walked on these paving stones.</t5517> <t5518>Let's follow her footsteps.</t5518>
<t5519>It was ten o'clock at night when he arrived in front of La Force prison, where she had stood hundreds of times.</t5519> <t5520>The short carpenter had just closed his shop and was standing in the doorway smoking a pipe.</t5520>
<t5521>− Hello, Citizen, - Sydney Carton greeted, stopping on his way; because this man was looking at him inquisitively.</t5521>
<t5522>Hello, Citizen.</t5522>
<t5523>− How is the Republic? −</t5523> <t5524>You mean the guillotine? −</t5524> <t5525>Still going strong. −</t5525> <t5526>Sixty-three heads today, soon it will quickly rise to a hundred. −</t5526> <t5527>Sometimes Samson and his men also complain of exhaustion. −</t5527> <t5528>Ha, ha, ha! That Samson is very humorous. −</t5528> <t5529>A real skilled barber! −</t5529> <t5530>Do you often see him... −</t5530>
<t5531>− Shaving? I see it all the time.</t5531> <t5532>Every day.</t5532> <t5533>A real skilled barber! Have you seen him work? −</t5533> <t5534>Never.</t5534>
<t5535>− Go see when he has to shave a whole bunch.</t5535> <t5536>Just imagine, Citizen; today he shaved sixty-three people, in the time it takes to smoke two pipes!</t5536> <t5537>Not even two pipes.</t5537> <t5538>That's the honest truth!</t5538> <t5539>While this short, grinning man extended his smoking pipe to explain how he timed the executioner, Carton turned away to suppress the rising urge to beat this man to death.</t5539>
<t5540>− But you're not English, - the woodcutter said, - even though you're dressed like an Englishman? −</t5540> <t5541>Indeed, - Carton said, stopping again, answering over his shoulder.</t5541>
<t5542>− You speak French like a French person.</t5542>
<t5543>− I used to study here before.</t5543>
<t5544>− Ah ha, just like the French! Goodbye, Mr. Englishman.</t5544>
<t5545>− Goodbye, Citizen.</t5545>
<t5546>− But remember to go see that barber clown, - the little guy kept insisting.</t5546> <t5547>- And remember to bring the pipe!</t5547> <t5548>Sydney hadn't gone far before he stopped right in the middle of the road under a flickering lamp and took out a pencil to write on a piece of paper.</t5548> <t5549>Then, with the determined steps of someone familiar with the way, he crossed many dark and dirty streets - dirtier than usual because even the busiest main streets were not being cleaned during this time of terror.</t5549> <t5550>He stopped in front of a pharmacy, where the owner himself was closing up.</t5550> <t5551>A small, dim, gloomy shop, located on a winding road leading uphill, owned by a small, dim, gloomy man.</t5551>
<t5552>After greeting this Citizen, he went straight to the pharmacy counter and placed a piece of paper in front of him.</t5552>
<t5553>− Whew! - The apothecary owner softly whistled as he read the note.</t5553> <t5554>- Oh dear! Oh dear! Oh dear! - Seeing that Sydney Carton was uninterested, he continued to ask.</t5554> <t5555>For you, Citizen? −</t5555> <t5556>For me.</t5556>
<t5557>− You must be careful to separate things, Citizen?</t5557> <t5558>Do you know the consequences if they get mixed together? −</t5558> <t5559>I know well.</t5559>
<t5560>The small packets were prepared and then handed to him.</t5560> <t5561>Carton placed each packet into the pocket of his inner coat, counted the payment, and leisurely walked out.</t5561>
<t5562>− There's nothing left to do until tomorrow, - he looked up at the moon and spoke to himself.</t5562> <t5563>- I can't sleep.</t5563>
<t5564>It was not an attitude of defiance or a display of recklessness, but a challenge when he uttered those words under the swiftly moving clouds.</t5564> <t5565>It was the determination of a weary soul, one who had wandered, struggled, and erred, but had finally found the right path and the ultimate destination.</t5565>
<t5566>In the old days, when he was famous as a promising young man among his competitive peers, his father passed away.</t5566> <t5567>His mother had died many years before that.</t5567> <t5568>The solemn words he had heard read when standing before his father's grave at that time now resurfaced in his mind as he walked through dark alleys, submerged in thick darkness, with the moon and drifting clouds high above.</t5568> <t5569>"The Lord said: I am the resurrection and the life; whoever believes in me will live, even though they have died.</t5569> <t5570>And whoever lives by believing in me will never die." In a dreadful city under the shadow of the guillotine, he wandered alone in the sorrowful night for the sixty-three people who had been executed today, and for the victims of tomorrow who were currently awaiting their fate in the prisons, for the victims of the days to come, this chain of thoughts made it easy for him to recall the holy words of the past, like finding the anchor of an old rusty ship that had sunk to the depths.</t5570> <t5571>He repeated those words and continued on.</t5571>
<t5572>He attentively looked at the brightly lit windows where people were about to go to sleep for a few hours of peace to forget the surrounding horrors; he looked at the church towers where no prayers were heard anymore because years of imposture, usurpation, and degradation under the guise of clergy had made the people lose faith; he looked at the distant cemeteries reserved for the Eternal Sleep, as the inscriptions on the gates read; looked at the overcrowded prisons; looked at the streets where groups of sixty people at a time were taken on carts to their deaths, a sight so common and familiar that people had become indifferent to all the sorrowful tales of the souls who perished under the guillotine.</t5572> <t5573>Thinking of all the living and the dead in the city temporarily suspending their wrath each night as they slept, Sydney Carton crossed the Seine once more, heading towards the brighter streets.</t5573>
<t5574>Few horse-drawn carriages were seen on the road because passengers in such carriages were easily suspected; those with status hid their faces under red hats, wore coarse shoes, and trudged along on foot.</t5574> <t5575>But the theaters were crowded; as he passed by, people were spilling out of the doors, cheerfully chatting on their way home.</t5575> <t5576>In front of one theater, a little girl stood with her mother, trying to navigate through the mud to cross the street.</t5576> <t5577>He helped carry the child across, and before the timid little arms let go of his neck, Carton asked the girl for a kiss.</t5577>
<t5578>“The Lord said: I am the resurrection and the life; whoever believes in me will live, even though they have died.</t5578> <t5579>And whoever lives by believing in me will never die.” At this moment, when the streets are quiet and the night is late, those words echoed in his footsteps and in the surrounding space.</t5579> <t5580>Completely calm and steadfast, he sometimes repeated those words on his way; but this prayer always resonated within him.</t5580>
<t5581>The night gradually faded, as he stood on the bridge listening to the river lapping against the embankment around the Ile de la Cité, where a picturesque jumble of buildings and churches shone brightly under the moonlight, the cold dawn emerging like the face of a corpse on the horizon.</t5581> <t5582>Then the night and the stars dimmed and faded, and for a moment it seemed as if all things had entered the realm of death.</t5582>
<t5583>But the glorious sun is rising, its rays spreading wide as if shattering the oppression of the night, as if repeating those sacred words that warm his heart.</t5583> <t5584>Raising his hand respectfully to shield his eyes, he looked straight into the morning sun; a bridge of light seemed to connect him with the sun while the river below sparkled in the morning light.</t5584>
<t5585>The water flowed swiftly, deeply, and unchangingly, like a kindred spirit in the tranquil morning.</t5585> <t5586>He strolled along the riverbank, gradually distancing himself from the residential area, and in the warm sunlight, he dozed off by the water's edge.</t5586> <t5587>Upon waking and continuing his walk, he lingered there a bit longer, watching a whirlpool spinning aimlessly until the river carried it out to sea.</t5587> <t5588>- "Just like me."</t5588> <t5589>A merchant ship with sails drooping like dead leaves came into view, drifted past, and faded away.</t5589> <t5590>As the silent water behind the ship disappeared, so too did the prayer - still echoing in his heart, asking for divine mercy for all his blind mistakes - end with the words: "I am the resurrection and the life."</t5590>
<t5591>Mr. Lorry was away when he got home, it was not hard to guess where this kind-hearted old man had gone.</t5591> <t5592>Sydney Carton only drank a little coffee, ate some bread, then bathed and changed clothes for comfort, and went to the courthouse.</t5592>
<t5593>In the courthouse's commotion and clamor, the black sheep - the people whom many commoners fearfully avoid - cornered him into a secluded spot within the crowd.</t5593> <t5594>Mr. Lorry was there, and Dr. Manette was there.</t5594> <t5595>She was there too, sitting next to her father.</t5595>
<t5596>When Darnay was brought to trial, to reassure him, she sent her husband a look full of sympathy and encouragement, full of loving admiration and tender sorrow, but also full of courage, which made Darnay's face flush, his eyes shine, and his heart beat faster.</t5596> <t5597>If anyone had noticed how her presence affected Sydney Carton, they would have seen that he shared the same exhilaration as Darnay himself.</t5597>
<t5598>In that unjust court, there was almost no procedural order to ensure that anyone accused would be fairly tried.</t5598> <t5599>There would not have been such a Revolution if all laws, procedures, and rituals had not been brutally trampled from the beginning, to the extent that the Revolution now discards all laws to exact a mad revenge akin to suicide.</t5599>
<t5600>Everyone was focused on the jury.</t5600> <t5601>The same determined patriots and reputable republicans as yesterday and the day before, as well as tomorrow and the day after.</t5601> <t5602>The most eager and notable among them was a man with a greedy face and fingers constantly hovering around his mouth; his presence made the crowd watching the trial extremely delighted. The bloodthirsty juror, with a demeanor as if he wanted to devour someone alive, was none other than Jacques Three of the Saint Antoine district.</t5602> <t5603>The entire jury was like a pack of hunting dogs gathered to judge a fallen deer.</t5603>
<t5604>Everyone then turned towards the five magistrates and the prosecutor.</t5604>
<t5605>Today, no one in this group seemed tolerant; everyone appeared ruthless, steely, and cruel.</t5605> <t5606>Then the crowd looked at each other, eyes showing approval, heads nodding in satisfaction, and then craned their necks forward, paying attention to the trial.</t5606>
<t5607>Charles Evrémonde, also known as Darnay.</t5607> <t5608>Released yesterday.</t5608> <t5609>Accused again and re-imprisoned yesterday.</t5609> <t5610>The indictment was issued to him yesterday.</t5610> <t5611>The suspect is condemned as an enemy of the Republic, a member of the aristocracy, belonging to a tyrannical family, of the type to be eliminated, for having exploited their privileges to brutally oppress the common people.</t5611> <t5612>Charles Evrémonde, also known as Darnay, according to that law of elimination, is certain to face the death penalty.</t5612>
<t5613>With just a few brief words, the prosecutor had finished the accusation.</t5613>
<t5614>The judge asked the defendant if they were publicly or secretly accused. − Publicly, Your Honor.</t5614>
<t5615>− Who is it for? −</t5615> <t5616>Three people.</t5616> <t5617>Ernest Defarge, a wine seller in Saint Antoine.</t5617>
<t5618>− Okay.</t5618>
<t5619>− Thérèse Defarge, his wife.</t5619>
<t5620>− Okay.</t5620>
<t5621>− Alexandre Manette, doctor.</t5621>
<t5622>The entire courtroom was in an uproar, and in the midst of the crowd, Dr. Manette, pale and trembling, stood up from where he had been sitting.</t5622>
<t5623>− Your Honor, I am indignant and object that it is a forgery and deceit.</t5623> <t5624>You are well aware that the defendant is my daughter's husband.</t5624> <t5625>My daughter and those dear to her are more important than my own life.</t5625> <t5626>Who is this schemer and where is he that he dares to say I accused my son-in-law! −</t5626> <t5627>Citizen Manette, please calm down.</t5627> <t5628>Not complying with the Court's authority means you are violating the law.</t5628> <t5629>As for what is more important than one's own life, for a good Citizen, nothing is more important than the Republic itself.</t5629>
<t5630>The rebuke was met with loud applause. The judge rang the bell and eagerly continued: −</t5630> <t5631>If the Republic demands that we sacrifice our own children, then it is our duty to do so.</t5631> <t5632>Let us proceed with the trial.</t5632> <t5633>For now, silence!</t5633> <t5634>The crowd once again erupted in wild applause.</t5634> <t5635>Dr. Manette sat down, looking around, his lips trembling; his daughter clung closely to him.</t5635> <t5636>The bloodthirsty member of the jury rubbed his hands together, then habitually brought one hand to his mouth.</t5636>
<t5637>Defarge was called out.</t5637> <t5638>When the noise in the court had subsided, he quickly recounted the story of Dr. Manette's imprisonment, how he had served the doctor since he was young, how the doctor was released from prison, and the state he was in when entrusted to him.</t5638> <t5639>Then came the brief examination because the court worked very quickly: −</t5639> <t5640>You played a role in the storming of the Bastille, didn't you, Citizen? −</t5640> <t5641>I believe so.</t5641>
<t5642>At this point, in the crowd, a woman's agitated voice shouted loudly: −</t5642> <t5643>You are one of the most patriotic people there.</t5643> <t5644>Why don't you say it all?</t5644> <t5645>You were the one who fired the cannon that day, and you were in the first group to enter that accursed fortress when it fell.</t5645> <t5646>Dear patriots, I speak the truth!</t5646> <t5647>It was the Goddess of Retribution, in the enthusiastic cheers of the crowd, manipulating the trial.</t5647> <t5648>The judge rang the bell; but the Goddess of Retribution, still excited, shouted loudly: −</t5648> <t5649>I challenge that bell! - And the crowd cheered in response.</t5649>
<t5650>− Please present to the court what you did that day in the Bastille prison, Citizen.</t5650>
<t5651>− I knew beforehand, - Defarge said while looking at his wife, who was standing at the bottom of the steps leading up to where he was standing, her eyes looking up at her husband.</t5651> <t5652>I knew that the prisoner I mentioned was locked in Cell One Hundred and Five, North Tower, when he was making shoes under my protection.</t5652> <t5653>When I fired the cannon that day, I decided that when the place fell, I would go and inspect that cell.</t5653> <t5654>The Bastille fell.</t5654> <t5655>I went up to that cell with a Citizen who is now on this jury, with a guard leading the way.</t5655> <t5656>I inspected it very carefully.</t5656> <t5657>In a hole in the chimney, where a stone had been pried out and replaced, I found a bundle of handwritten papers.</t5657> <t5658>This is that bundle of handwritten papers.</t5658> <t5659>I took the trouble to examine some samples of Dr. Manette's handwriting.</t5659> <t5660>It is indeed his handwriting.</t5660>
<t5661>I respectfully submit that bundle of papers, written in Dr. Manette's own handwriting, to the Chief Judge.</t5661>
<t5662>− Let the court read it aloud.</t5662>
<t5663>The courtroom was as silent as a grave - the prisoner being tried looked lovingly at his wife, his wife only took her eyes off her husband to anxiously look at her father, Dr. Manette stared intently at the person holding the papers, Madame Defarge never took her eyes off the prisoner, Defarge only saw the wife gloating, and all other eyes were directed towards the doctor, who paid no attention to anyone.</t5663>
<t5664>The stack of papers was read aloud.</t5664>
<t5665>10.</t5665> <t5666>The Entity of Darkness</t5666>
<t5667>I, Alexandre Manette, an unfortunate doctor, born in Beauvais, later living in Paris, write this sorrowful testament in the sorrowful Bastille prison, in the last month of the year 1767.</t5667> <t5668>I secretly write it piece by piece in extremely difficult circumstances.</t5668> <t5669>I intentionally hide it in the wall cavity of the chimney, where I have painstakingly created a hiding spot over a long period.</t5669> <t5670>A compassionate hand may find it there when I and my sufferings have turned to dust.</t5670>
<t5671>These lines were written with a sharp, rusty iron nib dipped in soot scraped from the chimney, mixed with blood, in the last month of the tenth year of my captivity.</t5671> <t5672>My heart was completely in despair.</t5672> <t5673>Through the terrifying signs that I had noticed in myself, I knew that my sanity would not remain intact for much longer, but I swear that at this very moment, I am completely lucid - my memory is still accurate and detailed - and I swear to write down the truth as if these were my last words, whether this testament is read by anyone or not on the Day of Final Judgment.</t5673>
<t5674>On a moonlit night covered with clouds, in the third week of December (I remember it was the 22nd of the month) in the year 1757, I was taking a walk along a deserted section of the Seine River dock to enjoy the cool air, about an hour's walk from my house on École de Médecine street, when a carriage came speeding from behind.</t5674> <t5675>As I cautiously stepped aside to avoid being run over, a head protruded from the carriage window and a voice shouted to the coachman to stop the horses.</t5675>
<t5676>The carriage came to a halt as soon as the coachman pulled the reins, and that same voice called me by name.</t5676> <t5677>I responded.</t5677> <t5678>The carriage had stopped far ahead, so the two gentlemen had time to open the door and step down before I arrived.</t5678>
<t5679>I saw that both were wrapped tightly in cloaks, and seemed to be hiding their identities.</t5679> <t5680>When they stood next to each other near the car door, I also noticed that both were about my age, or a little younger, and very similar in terms of build, demeanor, voice, and (as far as I could tell) even their faces.</t5680>
<t5681>− Are you Dr. Manette? - Someone asked.</t5681>
<t5682>− It's me.</t5682>
<t5683>− Doctor Manette, formerly in Beauvais, - another person said, - the young doctor, originally a surgeon, who has become famous quickly in Paris in the past one or two years? −</t5683> <t5684>Sir, - I replied, - I am indeed Doctor Manette to whom you have given those kind words.</t5684>
<t5685>− We went to your residence, - the first person said, - but unfortunately, we didn't find you at home, and we were told that you might be taking a walk in this direction, so we followed in hopes of catching up with you.</t5685> <t5686>Would you kindly get into this car and come with us? Both of them had a threatening demeanor, and as soon as they finished speaking, they moved to force me towards the car door.</t5686> <t5687>They had weapons.</t5687> <t5688>I did not.</t5688>
<t5689>− Sir, - I said, - please excuse me, but I often like to know who I have the honor of being needed by, and what condition the illness that requires me is in.</t5689>
<t5690>− Doctor, - the second person replied, - your patient is a noble person.</t5690> <t5691>As for the condition, we believe that your expertise will ensure that you understand it better than we can describe. That's enough.</t5691> <t5692>Would you be willing to get in the car?</t5692> <t5693>I had to comply and silently got into the car.</t5693> <t5694>Both of them got into the car after me, the last one jumping in after folding up the steps.</t5694>
<t5695>The horse-drawn carriage turned around and sped off as before.</t5695>
<t5696>I recount this conversation exactly as it happened.</t5696> <t5697>I am certain that every word is correct.</t5697> <t5698>I describe everything exactly as it occurred and force my mind to focus on this task.</t5698> <t5699>The parts I left unfinished later on are because I had to temporarily stop writing and hide this pen...</t5699>
<t5700>The carriage crossed many roads, passed through the northern city gate, and then went out to the countryside road.</t5700> <t5701>About two-thirds of a mile from the city gate - at that time I did not estimate the distance, but on the way back I paid attention - the carriage turned off the main road and soon stopped at a secluded house.</t5701> <t5702>The three of us got off the carriage and followed a soft, wet dirt path in a garden with a neglected overflowing fountain, heading to the main door.</t5702> <t5703>The door did not open immediately after ringing the bell, and one of my two guides swung a thick riding glove and struck the face of the person who opened the door.</t5703>
<t5704>That action didn't bother me much, as I had seen more people being beaten than dogs.</t5704> <t5705>But the second person, just as angry, also swung his hand to hit the person opening the door in that manner; the appearance and demeanor of these two were identical, so at that moment I thought they were twins.</t5705>
<t5706>From the moment we got off the car at the outer gate (the gate was tightly locked and one of the two brothers had to open it for us to enter and then lock it again), I heard many screams echoing from an upstairs room.</t5706> <t5707>I was taken directly to that room, the screams growing louder as we ascended the stairs, and I saw a patient suffering from encephalitis fever lying on the bed.</t5707>
<t5708>The patient is a stunningly beautiful woman, still young; certainly not over twenty.</t5708> <t5709>Her hair is disheveled and her arms are tied to her sides with various scarves and handkerchiefs.</t5709> <t5710>I noticed that all these bindings were items belonging to a gentleman's attire.</t5710> <t5711>Among them was a fringed sash to be worn across formal attire, embroidered with the coat of arms of a noble family and the letter E.</t5711>
<t5712>I noticed this in the very first minute I looked at the patient; because in her restless struggle, she had turned her face towards the edge of the bed, one end of the bandage was in her mouth, and there was a risk of suffocation.</t5712> <t5713>My first action was to reach out and pull the bandage so she could breathe easier; and at that moment, I immediately saw that sign embroidered in one corner.</t5713>
<t5714>I gently turned her around, placed my hand on her chest to calm her and keep her still, and looked at that face.</t5714> <t5715>In her eyes, the pupils had dilated and become vacant; she kept screaming shrilly and repeatedly saying, "My husband, my father, my brother!" then counting from one to twelve, and then exclaiming, "Hush!".</t5715> <t5716>She only paused to listen for a moment, no more, then the shrill screams continued, and the same words repeated, "My husband, my father, my brother!" and then counting to twelve, and again, "Hush!".</t5716> <t5717>It kept repeating like that, unchanged.</t5717> <t5718>Never stopping, except for the brief pauses between the delirious words.</t5718>
<t5719>− How long have you been like this? - I asked.</t5719>
<t5720>To distinguish between these two brothers, I will refer to them as the older brother and the younger brother; I call one the older brother because he appears to have the most authority.</t5720>
<t5721>It was the elder brother who answered: − Since around this time last night.</t5721>
<t5722>− Does she have a husband, father, and sibling? −</t5722> <t5723>A younger brother.</t5723>
<t5724>− Aren't you her brother? −</t5724> <t5725>No, - he answered with utmost contempt.</t5725>
<t5726>− Has she recently been involved with the number twelve?</t5726> <t5727>The impatient younger one interrupted: − Twelve o'clock? −</t5727> <t5728>There, gentlemen, - I said, still keeping my hand on her chest, - if you take me like this, I am helpless!</t5728> <t5729>If I had known beforehand what I would see, I would have brought the necessary items.</t5729> <t5730>But like this, it's a waste of time.</t5730> <t5731>In this desolate place, how can we find any medicine?</t5731>
<t5732>The older brother looked at the younger brother.</t5732>
<t5733>− There is a chest full of medicine here, - the younger brother said arrogantly, then pulled a small chest out of the cupboard and placed it on the table...</t5733>
<t5734>I opened several bottles, sniffed them, and brought the lids to my lips.</t5734> <t5735>I certainly wouldn't use these unless I needed anesthetic drugs with toxic substances.</t5735> <t5736>The younger one asked: "Can't use them?"</t5736> <t5737>"Sir, I have no choice but to use them," I replied and said nothing more.</t5737>
<t5738>I had a very hard time giving the patient the medication, and after many attempts, I finally managed to administer the desired dosage.</t5738> <t5739>Since I planned to give the medication again shortly to monitor its effects, I sat down next to the bed.</t5739> <t5740>Sitting in the corner of the room was a timid and frightened woman assisting (she was the wife of the person who had opened the door).</t5740> <t5741>The house was damp and decaying, with sparse furnishings - clearly, it had only been recently occupied temporarily.</t5741> <t5742>Some old, thick curtains had been nailed to the windows to muffle the sound of the screaming.</t5742> <t5743>The patient continued to scream in the same rhythm, after "My husband, my father, my brother!" she would count to twelve, then "Shh!".</t5743> <t5744>Her madness was so intense that I had to remove the straps binding her hands, but I was careful not to let her flailing arms cause her harm.</t5744> <t5745>The only small consolation in this situation was that my hand placed on the patient's chest had a calming effect, helping her to stay calm for a few minutes.</t5745> <t5746>But it did not stop the screams; they were more regular than the swinging of a pendulum.</t5746>
<t5747>Because my hand seemed to have the effect of calming the madness (I thought so), I sat by the bedside for half an hour, while the two brothers stood watching, and finally the older brother spoke up: −</t5747> <t5748>There is another patient.</t5748>
<t5749>I startled and asked: "Is it urgent?" −</t5749> <t5750>"It's best if you go check on the patient," he replied nonchalantly; then he picked up the lamp...</t5750>
<t5751>The patient is in the room behind the second staircase.</t5751>
<t5752>The room was like an attic above the horse stable; part of the ceiling was low and whitewashed, while the rest was open up to the edge of the tiled roof, exposing the crossbeams.</t5752> <t5753>In that open-ceiling area, there were straw, bundles of firewood, and a pile of apples stored in sand.</t5753> <t5754>I had to pass through that area to get to the other side.</t5754> <t5755>I remember it very clearly and precisely.</t5755> <t5756>I remember every detail vividly, and even in the Bastille prison, after nearly ten years of captivity, I still remember it as if I had seen it that night.</t5756>
<t5757>Lying on his back on a layer of straw on the ground, with his head resting on a pillow, was a handsome young farmer - a youth of about seventeen years old at most.</t5757> <t5758>He lay on his back, teeth clenched, his right hand clutching his chest, and his eyes blazing as he stared straight up.</t5758> <t5759>I couldn't see his wound when I knelt on one knee beside him, but I could tell he was about to die from a stab wound.</t5759>
<t5760>− I am a doctor, poor you, - I said.</t5760> <t5761>- Let me examine you.</t5761>
<t5762>− I don't need an examination, - he replied, - just leave it be.</t5762>
<t5763>The wound lay under his hand, and I coaxed him to lift his hand away.</t5763> <t5764>It was a sword wound that had pierced his chest twenty or twenty-four hours ago, but even if treated immediately, it would have been impossible to save him.</t5764> <t5765>In just a moment, he would die.</t5765> <t5766>When I turned towards his brother, I saw him looking down at the handsome young man who was dying with an indifferent gaze, as if the victim were a bird or a hare rather than a fellow human being.</t5766>
<t5767>− How did it come to this, sir? - I asked.</t5767>
<t5768>− A rabid dog gone mad! A serf! Forcing my brother to draw his sword and he fell under my brother's blade... like a nobleman.</t5768>
<t5769>There was no trace of compassion, sorrow, or humanity in that response.</t5769> <t5770>The speaker seemed to acknowledge the inconvenience of having someone from a different social class die here, and it would have been better if he had died in some obscure corner like other lowly beings.</t5770> <t5771>He had no compassion whatsoever for the young man or his fate.</t5771>
<t5772>The farmer's gaze slowly turned towards the speaker and then slowly turned towards me.</t5772>
<t5773>− Doctor, they are very arrogant, these nobles; but we lowly peasants also have moments of pride.</t5773> <t5774>They rob us, seize us, beat us, kill us, but sometimes we still have a bit of pride left.</t5774> <t5775>My sister... have you met my sister, doctor? You can still hear the screams here, even though the distance has muffled the sound.</t5775> <t5776>He talks as if his sister is present here.</t5776>
<t5777>− I met, - I said.</t5777>
<t5778>− That is my sister, doctor.</t5778> <t5779>These people, these aristocrats, have had the outrageous right to violate the chastity of our sisters for many years, but we still have virtuous girls.</t5779> <t5780>I know that, and I have heard my father say so.</t5780> <t5781>My sister is a virtuous girl.</t5781> <t5782>She was betrothed to a good man, who was also a tenant of his.</t5782> <t5783>We are all his tenants... the one standing there.</t5783> <t5784>And the other one is his brother, the worst of this vile family.</t5784>
<t5785>He had to exert all his strength to speak, but he spoke with a truly terrifyingly strong voice.</t5785>
<t5786>− We have been excessively plundered by the one standing over there, just like any other destitute peasant... forced to pay taxes without any mercy, forced to work for him without pay, forced to grind our grain at his mill, forced to use our meager harvests to feed his flock, while we couldn't even keep a single bird, plundered to the extent that if we had a bit of meat to eat, we had to eat it in fear, behind locked doors, hiding it from his men for fear of having our food snatched away...</t5786> <t5787>That's right, we were robbed, hunted, and stripped to such poverty that my father said bringing a child into this world was a crime, and the best prayer was for our women to be barren so that this wretched race would perish! I have never seen anyone speak about their oppression with such blazing indignation.</t5787> <t5788>I think that feeling must have been simmering within them, but I had never seen it erupt until I met this dying farmer.</t5788>
<t5789>− But doctor, my sister is already married.</t5789> <t5790>My brother-in-law, poor thing, was sick at that time, and my sister married the man she loved to take care of him in our little hut... which that person over there calls a doghouse.</t5790> <t5791>Just a few weeks after my sister got married, that guy's brother met my sister and developed a desire for her, demanding that his brother lend my sister to him...</t5791> <t5792>Such is the fate of us men as husbands!</t5792> <t5793>His brother agreed, but my sister, being virtuous and modest, ended up hating his brother just as much as I did.</t5793> <t5794>I don't know what those two did to force my brother-in-law to persuade his wife to comply.</t5794>
<t5795>Staring intently at me, the young man's gaze slowly shifted to the person standing there, and through both faces, I knew that everything he said was true.</t5795> <t5796>Two distinct prides were confronting each other, and even here in the Bastille dungeon, I could clearly see the indifferent defiance of the nobleman clashing with the trampled emotions and seething hatred of the peasant.</t5796>
<t5797>− You know, doctor, these nobles have the right to harness us lowly folks to their carriage and whip us to pull it.</t5797> <t5798>They treated my brother-in-law like that.</t5798> <t5799>You know they have the right to make us stay out in the garden all night to keep the frogs quiet so the nobles can sleep peacefully.</t5799>
<t5800>They kept my brother-in-law out in the cold frost all night, and in the morning, they tied my brother to the cart again.</t5800> <t5801>But my brother did not submit.</t5801> <t5802>No! One day, he was unbridled at noon to eat... if my brother could find food... my brother sobbed twelve times, each sob like the chime of a clock striking noon, and then died in my sister's arms.</t5802>
<t5803>Only an extraordinary determination to expose the crime could prolong his life.</t5803> <t5804>The young man struggled against the encroaching darkness of death and continued to tightly grip his right hand, pressing down on the wound.</t5804>
<t5805>− Then, with the agreement and even the assistance of the person standing there, his younger brother took my sister away, despite the things I know my sister surely told his younger brother...</t5805> <t5806>what those things are, you will soon know, doctor...</t5806> <t5807>He took my sister away... to indulge himself for a while.</t5807> <t5808>I saw my sister crossing the street.</t5808> <t5809>When I got home to report the news, my father had a heart attack and died immediately, without a chance to say a word that was weighing on his mind.</t5809> <t5810>I took my younger sister, I have another younger sister, to a hidden place far away from that savage, where at least my sister would never become his slave.</t5810>
<t5811>Then, I followed the guy's trail all the way here, and last night climbed into the house... a lowly dog, but with a sword in hand...</t5811> <t5812>Where is the attic window? Somewhere around here, right?</t5812> <t5813>The room darkened in his eyes; the world around him was shrinking.</t5813> <t5814>I glanced around and saw trampled straw on the floor as if there had been a scuffle.</t5814>
<t5815>− Hearing my voice, my sister ran in.</t5815> <t5816>I told my sister not to come near until he was dead.</t5816> <t5817>He came in here, first throwing some money at me; then he whipped me with a cane.</t5817> <t5818>But even though I was a lowly person, I struck back, forcing him to draw his sword.</t5818> <t5819>Let him break his blood-stained sword into as many pieces as he wants; he had to use all his swordsmanship just to keep himself alive.</t5819>
<t5820>A few minutes ago, I saw broken sword fragments lying in the straw.</t5820> <t5821>The nobleman's sword.</t5821> <t5822>Lying elsewhere was an old sword, likely the type used by a soldier.</t5822>
<t5823>− Now lift me up, doctor; lift me up.</t5823> <t5824>Where is he? −</t5824> <t5825>He is not here, - I said as I lifted the young man, thinking he meant his twin brother.</t5825>
<t5826>− Him! The arrogant nobles are like that, but he is afraid to meet me.</t5826> <t5827>Where is the person who was standing here just now? Turn my face towards him.</t5827>
<t5828>I followed, lifting the boy's head to rest on my knee.</t5828> <t5829>But at that moment, he suddenly had extraordinary strength; he stood up completely, forcing me to stand up to support him.</t5829>
<t5830>− Marquis, - he said, opening his eyes wide and turning towards the other person, his right hand raised high, - when the day of judgment comes, I will make you and your entire family, down to the last person, pay for your crimes.</t5830>
<t5831>I will make this blood cross mark and swear to you.</t5831> <t5832>On the Day of Judgment, I will make your sibling, the worst of this evil lineage, pay for their own sins.</t5832> <t5833>I will make this blood cross mark and swear to you.</t5833>
<t5834>Twice, the young man placed his hand on the wound on his chest, and with his index finger, he drew a cross in the air.</t5834> <t5835>He stood still for a moment with his finger still raised, and when his arm dropped, his body also collapsed, and I laid him down, already dead...</t5835>
<t5836>When I returned to the woman's bedside, I saw that she was still deliriously screaming just like before.</t5836> <t5837>I knew this condition could last for many hours and perhaps only be silent in the grave...</t5837>
<t5838>I gave her the same doses of medicine as before and sat by the bed until late at night.</t5838> <t5839>She did not stop her ear-piercing screams, nor did she mix up the exact order of her cries.</t5839>
<t5840>Always "My husband, my father, my brother!</t5840> <t5841>One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve.</t5841> <t5842>Shh!".</t5842>
<t5843>It was like that for twenty-six hours since the first time I met her.</t5843>
<t5844>I went back and forth twice and then sat next to her, and she began to weaken.</t5844> <t5845>I did everything I could to treat her, and after a while, she fell into a coma, lying still as if dead.</t5845>
<t5846>Just like the wind and rain finally ceased after the prolonged fierce storm.</t5846>
<t5847>I released her arms and called the maid to help me adjust her posture and attire.</t5847> <t5848>It was only then that I realized she was newly pregnant; and by that time, I had lost all hope of saving her.</t5848>
<t5849>− Is it dead yet? - The voice of the Marquis, whom I call my brother.</t5849> <t5850>He had just dismounted and entered the room, still wearing his riding boots.</t5850>
<t5851>− Not dead yet, - I said, - but about to die.</t5851>
<t5852>− These lowlifes are so persistent! - He said while looking down at her with curiosity.</t5852>
<t5853>− In suffering and despair, there is extraordinary strength, - I replied.</t5853>
<t5854>At first, he laughed mockingly, then he became uncomfortable.</t5854> <t5855>He pushed a chair towards me with his foot, ordered the maid to leave, and lowered his voice to say: −</t5855> <t5856>Doctor, seeing my brother having trouble with these tenants, I suggested that he invite you to help.</t5856> <t5857>You have a reputation, and you are a doctor building a career, so you probably know how to look out for your own interests.</t5857> <t5858>What you see here is something to be seen but not spoken of.</t5858>
<t5859>I listened to the patient's breathing and avoided answering.</t5859>
<t5860>− Will you deign to listen to me, doctor? −</t5860> <t5861>Sir, - I said - my profession requires me to always keep the patient's secrets.</t5861> <t5862>- I answered cautiously because I was secretly worried about the things I had seen and heard.</t5862>
<t5863>The girl's breath was so weak that I carefully checked her pulse and listened to her heartbeat.</t5863> <t5864>She was still alive, but very weak.</t5864> <t5865>Returning to my seat and looking around, I saw both siblings staring intently at me...</t5865>
<t5866>I write with great difficulty because the weather is as cold as a knife, and I also fear being discovered and thrown into a completely dark underground dungeon, so I have to simplify this story.</t5866> <t5867>My memory is still completely clear and accurate; I can remember and recount every word spoken between me and those two brothers.</t5867>
<t5868>She held on for a week.</t5868> <t5869>Until the last moment, I could only understand a few words she said to me by putting my ear close to her lips.</t5869> <t5870>The girl asked me where she was, and I told her; she asked who I was, and I told her.</t5870> <t5871>But trying to ask her name was in vain.</t5871> <t5872>She just gently shook her head on the pillow and kept the secret, like her younger brother.</t5872>
<t5873>I didn't have the chance to ask any more questions until I informed the two brothers that she was rapidly deteriorating and could not survive another day.</t5873> <t5874>Until then, although no one was present when she was conscious except the maid and me, one of the brothers always suspiciously sat behind the curtain at the head of her bed when I was there.</t5874> <t5875>But when it reached this stage, they seemed indifferent to any words she might entrust to me, as if I were about to die too - I had that thought.</t5875>
<t5876>I always noticed that they, out of pride, were very uncomfortable with the fact that the younger brother (as I called him) had dueled with a farmer, and moreover, a young farmer.</t5876> <t5877>The only thing that concerned them was probably that the duel was extremely humiliating to the family's honor; truly ridiculous.</t5877> <t5878>I often caught the younger brother's gaze, a gaze that always reminded me that he harbored a strange hatred for me because he knew I had heard the farmer recount the story.</t5878> <t5879>He appeared more gentle and courteous to me than the older brother; but I still recognized that hatred.</t5879> <t5880>I also realized that I was a nuisance in the older brother's mind as well.</t5880>
<t5881>My patient died, two hours before midnight - according to my watch, almost exactly at the same time I first met her.</t5881> <t5882>Only I was beside her when that young, desperate head slowly tilted to one side, ending all earthly suffering.</t5882>
<t5883>Two brothers are waiting in the room downstairs, eager to set off.</t5883> <t5884>When I was alone by the patient's bed, I heard them whipping their boots with riding crops, pacing back and forth.</t5884>
<t5885>− So, is it finally dead? - The brother asked when I came downstairs.</t5885>
<t5886>− She is dead, - I said.</t5886>
<t5887>− Congratulations, - he turned back and said to his younger brother.</t5887>
<t5888>Previously, he had paid me, but I had declined.</t5888> <t5889>Now he handed me a bundle of gold coins wrapped in paper.</t5889> <t5890>I took it but placed it on the table.</t5890> <t5891>I had thought about this and decided not to accept anything.</t5891>
<t5892>− Excuse me, - I said.</t5892> <t5893>- Not in this case.</t5893>
<t5894>The two brothers looked at each other, but then they bowed their heads to greet me, I greeted them back, and then we went our separate ways without saying a word...</t5894>
<t5895>I am tired, tired, exhausted from my misery.</t5895> <t5896>I cannot read what has been written by this thin hand.</t5896>
<t5897>Early in the morning, someone had left a small box with gold coins and my name written on it at my doorstep.</t5897> <t5898>From the very beginning, I was worried about what I should do.</t5898> <t5899>That day, I decided to write a private letter to the Minister about the two patients I was called to treat, describing the place I had visited; in fact, recounting everything.</t5899> <t5900>I knew the power of the court and the privileges of the nobility, so I wouldn't be surprised if this matter was never addressed; but I wanted to write it down to ease my mind.</t5900> <t5901>I kept this matter a secret, even from my wife; and I made this clear in my letter.</t5901> <t5902>I was not afraid for my own safety; but I understood clearly that disaster could befall others if they knew what I knew.</t5902>
<t5903>I was too busy that day, so by evening I still hadn't finished writing the letter.</t5903> <t5904>The next morning, I woke up earlier than usual to finish it.</t5904> <t5905>It was the last day of the year.</t5905> <t5906>Just as the letter was finished and lying in front of me, I heard that a lady was waiting and wanted to meet me...</t5906>
<t5907>I'm increasingly exhausted and unable to complete the tasks I've set for myself.</t5907> <t5908>It's too cold, too gloomy, my senses have become numb, and the darkness surrounding me is terrifying.</t5908>
<t5909>She is still young, graceful, and beautiful, but seems to have a short life expectancy.</t5909> <t5910>She looks very worried.</t5910> <t5911>She introduced herself as the wife of Marquis St. Evrémonde.</t5911> <t5912>I thought of the title the peasant had called the brother, and the initials embroidered on that scarf, then easily concluded that I had recently met the very nobleman.</t5912>
<t5913>My memory is still accurate, but I cannot recall every word of this conversation.</t5913> <t5914>I suspect that I am being watched more closely than before, and I do not know when I will be monitored.</t5914> <t5915>She partly suspects, partly discovers the main events in that cruel story, the story involving her husband, and the story of my being invited.</t5915> <t5916>She does not know that the other girl is dead.</t5916> <t5917>Very distressed, she expressed her hope that she could silently share the compassion of a woman.</t5917> <t5918>She hopes that the heavens will not punish the noble family that has long been hated for causing so much suffering to many people.</t5918>
<t5919>She had reason to believe that the other girl still had a younger sister, and her greatest desire was to help that younger sister.</t5919> <t5920>I can only say that there indeed is a younger sister, but beyond that, I know nothing more.</t5920> <t5921>Relying on my discretion, she eagerly came to see me, hoping I would reveal the name and whereabouts of this younger sister.</t5921> <t5922>But both of those things, up to now, I do not know...</t5922>
<t5923>These pieces of paper are getting me into trouble.</t5923> <t5924>Yesterday, one was confiscated and I was warned.</t5924> <t5925>I have to finish writing the story today.</t5925>
<t5926>She is a good person, compassionate, and unhappy in her marriage.</t5926> <t5927>How can one be happy!</t5927> <t5928>Her brother-in-law does not trust her and even hates her; he uses every means to oppose his sister-in-law; she is terrified of him and also terrified of her own husband.</t5928> <t5929>When I escorted her to the door, I saw a beautiful little boy, about two or three years old, in her carriage.</t5929>
<t5930>− Because of my child, doctor, - she said through her tears while pointing to the baby, - for my child, I do everything I can to make up for it.</t5930>
<t5931>If not, my child will inherit all the grudges.</t5931> <t5932>I have a feeling that if this wrongdoing is not compensated by someone, one day my own child will have to repay that debt.</t5932> <t5933>All that I have... worth not much more than a few jewels... I am determined to entrust to my child as a primary duty to use it to compensate the harmed family out of compassion for the deceased mother, if it is possible to find that younger sister.</t5933> <t5934>- She kissed the little boy, then spoke while tenderly caressing her child.</t5934>
<t5935>- It's all for you.</t5935> <t5936>You must do exactly what I tell you, Charles. - Yes! - The child replied bravely.</t5936> <t5937>I kissed her hand, she lovingly embraced the child, and then left.</t5937> <t5938>Since then, I have not seen her again.</t5938>
<t5939>Because she mentioned her husband's name, thinking I already knew it, I did not include this in my letter anymore.</t5939> <t5940>I sealed the letter and, trusting no one, personally sent it that very day.</t5940>
<t5941>That evening, the last night of the year, around nine o'clock, a man in black rang the bell at the gate demanding to see me and quietly followed my young servant, Ernest Defarge, upstairs.</t5941> <t5942>I was sitting beside my wife. - Oh, my beloved wife! My lovely English wife! - When the servant entered the room, we saw behind Defarge the silent stranger, who should have been waiting outside the gate.</t5942>
<t5943>There is an urgent case on St. Honoré Street, he said.</t5943> <t5944>It won't take much of my time because he already has a carriage waiting.</t5944>
<t5945>The vehicle brought me here, to this grave.</t5945> <t5946>As soon as I stepped out of the house, a black cloth from behind tightly gagged my mouth and bound my hands.</t5946> <t5947>From a dark corner across the street, those two brothers crossed over and just waved a hand to signal that they had recognized me.</t5947> <t5948>The Marquis took out the letter I had sent from his pocket, showed it to me, then burned it in the flame of the lantern he held and used his foot to extinguish the ashes.</t5948> <t5949>Not a word was spoken.</t5949> <t5950>I was brought here, I was brought to this living grave.</t5950>
<t5951>If only during the many terrible years that have just passed, God had made one of those two brothers take pity and inform me of any news about my beloved wife - even just a word to let me know whether she was alive or dead - then I would still think that God had not abandoned them.</t5951> <t5952>But now I believe that the mark of the cross is their fate because God has refused to show mercy.</t5952> <t5953>For them and their descendants, to the last one, I, Alexandre Manette, an unfortunate prisoner, on this last night of the year 1767, in unbearable agony, swear that there will come a time when all these sins will be judged.</t5953> <t5954>I denounce them to both Heaven and Earth.</t5954>
<t5955>As soon as the reading of this document ended, the entire courtroom erupted in chaos.</t5955>
<t5956>A sound full of longing and eagerness resonated with only one thing: blood.</t5956> <t5957>This story had incited the most frenzied fits of revengeful rage of that time, and surely there was not a single head in all of France that did not bow in trembling fear before that wrath.</t5957>
<t5958>In the chaotic courtroom and amidst the jeers, it goes without saying that the Defarges had hidden these papers, along with other records taken from the Bastille prison, which had been circulated and awaited the opportunity to be revealed.</t5958> <t5959>It goes without saying that this hated family had long been cursed by the people of the Saint Antoine district and was on the death list.</t5959> <t5960>No one, no matter how virtuous and meritorious, could escape that day with such an accusation.</t5960>
<t5961>And even worse for the convicted person, the accuser was a renowned Citizen, his close friend, and his father-in-law.</t5961> <t5962>One of the mad aspirations of the masses is to emulate the dubious virtues of ancient times by sacrificing and self-sacrificing before the altar of the people.</t5962> <t5963>Therefore, when the Judge said (for saying otherwise would risk his head being chopped off) that the reputable doctor had greatly served the Republic by exterminating a detestable noble family, that he must surely feel secretly proud and joyful for having made his daughter a widow and his grandchild an orphan, those words incited a frenzied patriotic emotion devoid of any humanity.</t5963>
<t5964>− Can the doctor influence the people here? - Madame Defarge whispered while smiling at the Goddess of Vengeance. - Now save him, doctor, save him! With each vote of the jury member came a roar from the crowd.</t5964> <t5965>Vote after vote.</t5965> <t5966>Roar after roar.</t5966>
<t5967>All with one heart.</t5967> <t5968>He is a noble by lineage and by nature, an enemy of the Republic, a notorious oppressor of the people.</t5968> <t5969>Return to the Conciergerie prison, and face execution within the next twenty-four hours!</t5969>
<t5970>11.</t5970> <t5971>In the dark</t5971>
<t5972>The unfortunate wife of the innocent man who had just been sentenced to death collapsed as if the verdict had ended her life.</t5972> <t5973>But she did not utter a word; quickly overcoming the horror because the strong voice within urged her to remember that in this world, only she could help her husband face it rather than endure more suffering.</t5973>
<t5974>The judges had to join the street protest march, and the court postponed the trial.</t5974> <t5975>The noise of people bustling out of the court from all directions still echoed as Lucie stood with her hand raised towards her husband, her face filled with love and comfort.</t5975>
<t5976>− If only I could touch that person!</t5976> <t5977>If only I could hug that person just once! Oh, good citizens, if only you could sympathize with us!</t5977> <t5978>Only one jailer remained along with two of the four who had arrested Darnay last night, and Barsad.</t5978> <t5979>The people had all poured out to watch the spectacle on the street.</t5979> <t5980>Barsad suggested to the others: −</t5980> <t5981>Then let her hug this person; just for a moment.</t5981>
<t5982>They silently agreed and led Lucie across the rows of seats to the high platform where Darnay, if he leaned over the railing, could reach out to embrace his wife.</t5982>
<t5983>− Farewell, my love.</t5983> <t5984>This is the final blessing for my beloved.</t5984> <t5985>We will meet again in the resting place of the weary souls!</t5985> <t5986>These were the words of the husband as he embraced his wife.</t5986>
<t5987>− I can endure it, Charles.</t5987> <t5988>There is a blessing protecting me; don't be sorrowful for me.</t5988> <t5989>Send our final blessings to our child.</t5989>
<t5990>− Please send this to our child for me.</t5990> <t5991>Send this kiss to our child on my behalf.</t5991> <t5992>Send this farewell to our child on my behalf.</t5992>
<t5993>− Darling. Wait! Just a minute! - Charles Darnay was letting her go. - We won't be apart for long.</t5993> <t5994>This suffering will soon end my life; but I will fulfill my duty to our child as long as I can, so that when I pass away, God will send friends to help our child as He has helped me.</t5994>
<t5995>Dr. Manette had been following his daughter, and would have knelt before both Charles and Lucie if his son-in-law had not reached out to stop him.</t5995> <t5996>Charles exclaimed: "No, no! You have done nothing, you have done nothing, that you should kneel before us! We now know how hard you struggled in the past."</t5996> <t5997>We now know what you went through when you doubted my lineage, and when you knew for certain.</t5997> <t5998>We now know that you resisted and overcame your aversion to me because of the love you have for Lucie.</t5998> <t5999>We are deeply grateful to you, with all our love and filial piety, may heaven bless you! The father could say nothing more than to run his hands through his silver hair in anguish and let out a cry of despair.</t5999>
<t6000>− There's nothing else to be done, - Charles said.</t6000> <t6001>- Everything has been decided.</t6001> <t6002>You have always strived in vain to fulfill the wish your mother entrusted to you, which from the beginning led you to meet me.</t6002> <t6003>Such cruelty cannot give birth to anything good, such an unfortunate beginning cannot have a happier ending.</t6003> <t6004>Please be calm and forgive me.</t6004> <t6005>May the heavens bless you! Lucie let go of her hand when Charles was taken away and she stood watching her husband, hands clasped as if in prayer, her face glowing with affection, even with a reassuring smile.</t6005> <t6006>As Charles disappeared behind the door for the condemned, she turned back, resting her head on her father's chest, intending to say something but then collapsed.</t6006>
<t6007>At that moment, from a hidden corner where he had been standing motionless, Sydney Carton stepped forward to support her.</t6007> <t6008>His demeanor was not entirely one of compassion - there was a certain proud intensity on his face.</t6008>
<t6009>− Should I take her to the carriage?</t6009> <t6010>She is very light, let me carry her.</t6010>
<t6011>Sydney gently carried Lucie to the door and softly placed her on the seat cushion.</t6011> <t6012>Doctor Manette and the old friend got into the carriage, while he took the seat next to the coachman.</t6012>
<t6013>When the car arrived at the gate of the house where Sydney had stopped in the darkness just a few hours earlier, imagining himself walking on the rough stone that had once supported her steps, he carried her out of the car and up the stairs into the apartment.</t6013> <t6014>Once there, he laid Lucie down on the couch while the little girl and Miss Pross stood beside them, crying out loud.</t6014>
<t6015>− Don't wake her up, - he said softly to Miss Pross, - it's better to let her be.</t6015> <t6016>She just fainted, don't wake her up.</t6016>
<t6017>− Oh, Mr. Carton, Mr. Carton! - Little Lucie exclaimed as she jumped to hug him in her sorrow. - Now that you're here, please do something to help mama, do something to save papa!</t6017> <t6018>Oh, look at my mother, Mr. Carton! Among all the people who love her, how can you bear to see her like this? He bent down to little Lucie, pressing his cheek against the child's rosy one.</t6018> <t6019>He gently pushed the little girl away and looked at Lucie who had fainted.</t6019>
<t6020>− Before you go, - he said, hesitating - ... may I kiss your mother?</t6020> <t6021>The words he whispered when his lips touched hers would be remembered forever.</t6021> <t6022>The child, standing beside him, would recount it later and even in old age would tell it to his descendants, that Carton had said: “For the life of the one you love.”</t6022> <t6023>As he walked into the next room, he suddenly turned to Mr. Lorry and Dr. Manette who were following him, and he said to the doctor: −</t6023> <t6024>Just yesterday you still had a lot of influence, Dr. Manette; at least try once more today.</t6024> <t6025>The officials and everyone in authority are very friendly with you, acknowledging your merits, aren't they? −</t6025> <t6026>There is nothing that could save Charles that I haven't tried.</t6026> <t6027>I was very confident that I could save him; and I did so.</t6027> <t6028>- He replied with great difficulty, word by word.</t6028>
<t6029>− Try again.</t6029> <t6030>There isn't much time left until tomorrow afternoon, but keep trying.</t6030>
<t6031>− I have the same idea.</t6031> <t6032>I won't sit still for a minute.</t6032>
<t6033>− That's good.</t6033> <t6034>I know that capable people like you have done many great things before... although never, - he added with a smile and a sigh, - anything as extraordinary as this.</t6034> <t6035>But give it a try! Life isn't worth much when we waste it, but it's worth trying.</t6035> <t6036>If you don't try, life isn't worth a penny.</t6036>
<t6037>− I will go, - Dr. Manette said, - go immediately to meet the prosecutor and the judge, I will go meet others whose names are not convenient to mention.</t6037> <t6038>I will also write letters, and...</t6038> <t6039>But wait! There is a festival on the street, and no one will be available until evening.</t6039>
<t6040>− That's right. Oh! Such a vain hope, and even more vain to delay until evening.</t6040> <t6041>Anyway, I still want to know how you plan to do it, that's all!</t6041> <t6042>I don't dare to expect anything! When can you meet those formidable authorities, Dr. Manette? −</t6042> <t6043>As soon as it gets dark, I hope so.</t6043> <t6044>Within one or two hours.</t6044>
<t6045>− It will get dark quickly after four o'clock.</t6045> <t6046>Let's assume one or two more hours.</t6046> <t6047>If I arrive at Mr. Lorry's place at nine o'clock, hopefully, I will know the results of what you did, either from Mr. Lorry or from you yourself? −</t6047> <t6048>Alright.</t6048>
<t6049>− Wishing you success!</t6049> <t6050>Mr. Lorry followed Sydney to the door and, as he was about to leave, he held him back by the shoulder.</t6050>
<t6051>− I have no hope, - Mr. Lorry said, his voice a whisper of sorrow.</t6051>
<t6052>− Me too.</t6052>
<t6053>− If any of those people, or the whole crowd, had any intention of sparing Darnay; this is an illusion because his life or anyone else's means nothing to them!...</t6053> <t6054>But I think that even if they wanted to, they wouldn't dare to spare Darnay's life after the public's reactions during the trial.</t6054>
<t6055>− I think so too.</t6055> <t6056>I smelled the scent of blood in their shouts.</t6056>
<t6057>Mr. Lorry leaned against the door frame, hiding his face in his arm.</t6057>
<t6058>− Don't be discouraged, - Carton said very gently, - don't be distressed.</t6058> <t6059>I intended to encourage Dr. Manette in that way because I thought it might bring some comfort and solace to Lucie.</t6059> <t6060>Otherwise, she might think that everyone had given up on Darnay's life, and that would trouble her greatly.</t6060>
<t6061>− Yes, yes, that's right, - Mr. Lorry replied while wiping his tears, you're right.</t6061> <t6062>But Darnay will lose his life; there is no more hope.</t6062>
<t6063>− Correct.</t6063> <t6064>Darnay will lose his life; there is no more hope, - Carton repeated.</t6064>
<t6065>Then he confidently stepped down the stairs.</t6065>
<t6066>12.</t6066> <t6067>Darkness</t6067>
<t6068>Sydney Carton stopped on the street, not yet knowing where he would go.</t6068>
<t6069>− At Tellson's Bank at nine o'clock, - he thoughtfully said to himself.</t6069>
<t6070>- Should I reveal myself at this moment?</t6070> <t6071>Probably yes.</t6071> <t6072>It is best for the people here to know that there is someone like me around; that is a wise precaution, and possibly a necessary preparation.</t6072>
<t6073>But be careful, be careful! Think carefully! The steps that had just become familiar with the chosen path, he hesitated, turned into two or three alleys that were gradually darkening, weighing the possible consequences in his mind.</t6073> <t6074>The initial thoughts were confirmed.</t6074>
<t6075>− So it's for the best, - he finally decided, - the people here must know that there is someone who looks like me.</t6075> <t6076>- And he headed towards Saint Antoine.</t6076>
<t6077>Today, Defarge has proclaimed himself as the wine seller in the Saint Antoine district.</t6077> <t6078>For someone familiar with the capital, it is easy to find that place without asking anyone.</t6078> <t6079>After identifying the location, Carton walked out from the nearby streets, went into a restaurant to have dinner, and slept there.</t6079> <t6080>For the first time in many years, he did not drink strong liquor.</t6080> <t6081>Since last night, he had not drunk anything except a bit of thin, weak wine, and last night he had slowly poured all the brandy into Mr. Lorry's fireplace as if he had severed ties with it.</t6081>
<t6082>At seven o'clock, he woke up comfortably and went out again.</t6082> <t6083>While heading towards Saint Antoine, he stopped in front of a display window with a mirror, adjusted his attire a bit, tightened his loose tie, raised the collar of his coat, and smoothed his messy hair.</t6083> <t6084>Then he went straight to Defarge's tavern and went inside.</t6084>
<t6085>By chance, there were no other customers in the tavern except for Jacques Ba, the man with restless fingers and a booming voice.</t6085> <t6086>This man he had seen sitting on the jury; he was at the small bar, drinking and chatting with Mr. and Mrs. Defarge. The Goddess of Revenge also joined the conversation, as a regular patron of this tavern.</t6086>
<t6087>When Carton entered, chose a seat, and ordered (in very poor French) a small portion of wine, Madame Defarge glanced at him indifferently, then looked more closely, and even more closely, and personally went over to ask what he had ordered.</t6087>
<t6088>He repeats what he said.</t6088>
<t6089>− The Englishman? - Madame Defarge raised her thick black eyebrows inquisitively.</t6089>
<t6090>After looking at her as if it was very difficult to understand a single French word, Carton responded in the same foreign accent as before.</t6090>
<t6091>− Yes, madame, yes.</t6091> <t6092>I am English! Madame Defarge turned back to the counter to get the wine, and while he held the Jacobin newspaper, pretending to try to understand the tangled words, he heard her say: −</t6092> <t6093>Swear to you, exactly like Evrémonde! Defarge brought the wine and greeted.</t6093>
<t6094>− What? − Hello.</t6094>
<t6095>− Ah! Hello, Citizen, - Carton poured wine into his glass.</t6095> <t6096>- Ah! Good wine.</t6096> <t6097>I drink to the Republic.</t6097>
<t6098>Defarge returned to the counter and said, "It does look a bit similar."</t6098>
<t6099>− I told you it was exactly the same, - the wife responded coldly.</t6099>
<t6100>− He haunts her mind, madame. - Jacques Ba reconciled.</t6100>
<t6101>− What else! - The Goddess of Vengeance burst out laughing, interjecting.</t6101>
<t6102>− And you are eagerly excited to see him again tomorrow.</t6102>
<t6103>Carton slowly traced his index finger along each line and word on the newspaper page, his face feigning concentration. The group of people leaned against the bar, huddling close together and speaking softly.</t6103> <t6104>After a while, they all fell silent and looked towards Carton without disturbing his focus on reading the Jacobin newspaper. They then continued their conversation.</t6104>
<t6105>− What madame says is true, - Jacques Ba spoke up.</t6105> <t6106>- Why stop?</t6106> <t6107>It's very reasonable.</t6107> <t6108>Why stop? − Ah, ah, - Defarge argued, - but one must stop somewhere.</t6108> <t6109>After all, where is the limit? −</t6109> <t6110>When everything is destroyed, - Madame Defarge said.</t6110>
<t6111>− Great! - Jacques Ba said in a booming voice.</t6111> <t6112>The Goddess of Vengeance also enthusiastically agreed.</t6112>
<t6113>− Extermination is the best strategy, my dear, - Defarge said somewhat uneasily. - In general, I am not against it.</t6113> <t6114>But this doctor has suffered too much; today you saw him; you saw his face when those papers were read out.</t6114>
<t6115>− I have seen that face! - The wife's voice was furious and contemptuous. Yes.</t6115> <t6116>I have seen that face!</t6116> <t6117>I have seen that his face is not the face of a true friend of the Republic.</t6117> <t6118>Let him take care of his own face! −</t6118> <t6119>You have also seen how his daughter suffers, - Defarge said urgently, - that also causes him terrible pain! −</t6119> <t6120>I have seen his daughter, - said Madame Defarge.</t6120> <t6121>- Yes, I have seen his daughter, not just once.</t6121> <t6122>I saw her today and many other times.</t6122> <t6123>I saw her in the courtroom, and I saw her on the street next to the prison. I just need to lift a finger!... - Madame Defarge seemed to raise her index finger and let it drop heavily on the counter in front of her, like the blade of a guillotine coming down.</t6123> <t6124>The eavesdropper's eyes remained fixed on the newspaper.</t6124>
<t6125>− Outstanding Female Citizen! - Jacques Ba said loudly.</t6125>
<t6126>− You are an angel! - The Goddess of Vengeance hugged Madame Defarge tightly.</t6126>
<t6127>− As for you, - she insisted to her husband, - luckily, you have no power; if you did, you would definitely save that son-in-law right now.</t6127>
<t6128>− No! - Defarge objected. - Not at all, even if I had the strength to do so! But I stop this matter here.</t6128> <t6129>I say, stop here.</t6129>
<t6130>− Then see you again, Jacques, - said Madame Defarge, her voice full of anger.</t6130> <t6131>See you again too, Goddess of Vengeance. We will meet again, both of you! Remember that!</t6131> <t6132>I have long placed this entire family on the list for condemnation and extermination, for all kinds of crimes of tyranny and oppression.</t6132> <t6133>Ask my husband if it's true.</t6133>
<t6134>− That's right, - Defarge confirmed without anyone asking.</t6134>
<t6135>− On the day this glorious era began, when the Bastille fell, my husband found the stack of papers read in court today, my husband brought them home, at midnight, when the tavern was closed and quiet, we read them, right here, under this lamp.</t6135> <t6136>Just ask my husband if it's true.</t6136>
<t6137>− That's right, - Defarge confirmed.</t6137>
<t6138>− That night, I told my husband after finishing reading the stack of papers, the lamp had run out of oil, and dawn had begun to break through the shutters and those bars, I said I needed to reveal a secret.</t6138> <t6139>Just ask my husband if it's true.</t6139>
<t6140>− That's right, - Defarge confirmed again.</t6140>
<t6141>− I told that secret to my husband.</t6141> <t6142>I pounded my chest with these two hands just as I am pounding my chest now, and I said, "Defarge, I was raised by the fishermen on the coast, but my real family is the peasant family that was harmed by the Evrémonde brothers, as the papers in the Bastille prison recounted.</t6142>
<t6143>Defarge, the sister of the farmer who was wounded and lying on the floor, is my sister, that husband is my brother-in-law, the unborn child is their child, that farmer is my brother, that father is my father, those who died are all my relatives, and only I am left to demand justice from them!</t6143> <t6144>Ask my husband if it's true.</t6144>
<t6145>− That's right, - Defarge confirmed once again.</t6145>
<t6146>− Then show me where the wind and fire stop! - Madame Defarge replied.</t6146> <t6147>Don't talk to me! Knowing the reason for Madame Defarge's terrible hatred, the two listeners were disgustingly delighted and both wholeheartedly encouraged her, while the solitary guest over there, eyes glued to the newspaper, could still feel the woman's livid hatred.</t6147> <t6148>Defarge, the weak minority, interjected a few words reminding them of the Marquis's compassionate wife, but it only made his wife repeat her earlier statement: −</t6148> <t6149>Then show me where the wind and fire stop! Don't talk to me! A few customers entered the tavern and the group inside dispersed.</t6149>
<t6150>The English guest paid for the wine, awkwardly counted the change, and then asked for directions to the National Castle like a stranger.</t6150> <t6151>Madame Defarge escorted the guest to the door, grabbed the guest's arm, and pointed the way.</t6151> <t6152>The guest couldn't suppress the thought that if only he could grab the innkeeper's wife's arm, lift her up, and stab her deeply in the side with a sword, it would be a blessing for many people.</t6152>
<t6153>But then Carton silently left and soon disappeared into the darkness of the prison wall.</t6153> <t6154>At the appointed time, he went from there to Mr. Lorry's place and found the old man anxiously pacing back and forth.</t6154>
<t6155>He had been with Lucie until just a few minutes ago before leaving to make it to this appointment on time.</t6155> <t6156>There has been no sign of Dr. Manette since he left this bank at nearly four o'clock.</t6156> <t6157>Lucie still clings to the faint hope that her father might be able to arrange something to save Charles.</t6157> <t6158>The doctor has been gone for five hours now; no one knows where he has gone.</t6158>
<t6159>Mr. Lorry waited until ten o'clock but still did not see Dr. Manette return. Not wanting to worry Lucie any further, he arranged to return to Lucie's house and would come back to the Bank at midnight.</t6159> <t6160>Meanwhile, Carton sat alone by the fireplace waiting for the doctor.</t6160>
<t6161>He waited, waited endlessly, and the clock had struck twelve times but still there was no sign of Dr. Manette returning.</t6161> <t6162>Mr. Lorry returned, without any news from the doctor or from anyone else.</t6162> <t6163>Where could he have gone?</t6163> <t6164>The two were discussing this, almost concluding that Dr. Manette's prolonged absence was a faint sign of hope when they heard the doctor's footsteps on the stairs.</t6164> <t6165>As soon as Dr. Manette stepped into the room, it was clear that all hope had vanished.</t6165>
<t6166>Never knew if the doctor actually met someone or was just wandering back and forth on the road.</t6166> <t6167>When Dr. Manette stared at them, no one asked any questions because the doctor's face had already said everything.</t6167>
<t6168>− I can't find it, - the doctor said, - I must find it.</t6168> <t6169>Where is it? Head without a hat, neck without a scarf, and while the doctor spoke and helplessly scanned the room, he took off his coat and let it drop to the floor.</t6169>
<t6170>− Where is my cobbler's bench? I've looked everywhere for it but can't find it.</t6170> <t6171>What did they do with my unfinished shoes?</t6171> <t6172>It's urgent, I need to finish those shoes.</t6172>
<t6173>Carton and Mr. Lorry looked at each other, their hearts frozen.</t6173>
<t6174>− Mau, mau! - Doctor Manette still spoke in a miserable, whining voice.</t6174> <t6175>Let me work.</t6175> <t6176>Give me back my shoes.</t6176>
<t6177>Hearing no response from anyone, he ruffled his hair, stomped his feet on the floor, like an angry child.</t6177>
<t6178>− Don't torment this poor, lonely, miserable man anymore, - Mr. Manette pleaded with them in a terrifying scream. - Give me back the shoes! What will happen if I don't finish the shoes tonight?</t6178> <t6179>Madness, complete madness!</t6179> <t6180>Clearly, there was no hope of persuading or calming the doctor, without a word, Carton and Mr. Lorry both placed their hands on the doctor's shoulders, coaxing him to sit down by the fireplace and promising him that he could make the shoes immediately.</t6180> <t6181>Mr. Manette sank into the chair, dejectedly staring at the embers, and cried.</t6181> <t6182>Everything that had happened since the doctor left the attic in Saint Antoine seemed like a fleeting dream or illusion, and in Mr. Lorry's eyes, the doctor had reverted to the very person Defarge had once watched over.</t6182>
<t6183>Though stunned and heartbroken by this terrible collapse, both Carton and Mr. Lorry knew that now was not the time to give in to their emotions.</t6183> <t6184>They were forced to be strong as the doctor's only daughter could no longer rely on this last hope.</t6184> <t6185>Once again, without a word, the two looked at each other, their faces full of meaning.</t6185>
<t6186>Carton was the first to speak: −</t6186> <t6187>The last chance, which was already slim, is now lost.</t6187> <t6188>Yes, we should bring him back to Lucie.</t6188> <t6189>But before you go, please listen to me carefully for a minute.</t6189> <t6190>Do not ask why there are conditions as I will set, do not ask why there are promises as I will demand.</t6190> <t6191>I have reasons... legitimate reasons.</t6191>
<t6192>− I have no doubt, - Mr. Lorry replied. - Please go ahead.</t6192>
<t6193>The person sitting on the chair between them kept rocking back and forth in a peculiar manner and lamenting.</t6193> <t6194>The two people lowered their voices to talk as if they were sitting beside a patient's bed in the middle of the night.</t6194>
<t6195>Carton bent down to pick up the doctor's coat that was tangled under his feet.</t6195> <t6196>As he picked it up, a small box that the doctor often used to store his daily work notes fell to the floor from the coat.</t6196> <t6197>Carton picked up the box, and inside was a folded piece of paper.</t6197>
<t6198>− We should take a look at this! - He said.</t6198>
<t6199>Mr. Lorry nodded in agreement.</t6199> <t6200>He opened it and exclaimed: − Thank God! −</t6200> <t6201>What's the matter? - Mr. Lorry asked anxiously.</t6201>
<t6202>− Wait! I will explain clearly later.</t6202> <t6203>First, - he reached into his coat pocket and took out another piece of paper, - this is a pass that allows me to leave this capital city.</t6203> <t6204>Take a look. See...?</t6204> <t6205>Sydney Carton, an Englishman?</t6205> <t6206>Mr. Lorry held the paper open in his hand, attentively looking at Carton's eager face.</t6206>
<t6207>− Please keep this for me until tomorrow.</t6207> <t6208>Tomorrow I will meet Darnay in prison, remember, and I should not bring this paper with me.</t6208>
<t6209>− Why not? −</t6209> <t6210>I don't know; I don't want to carry it.</t6210> <t6211>Now let's look at the paper that Dr. Manette is carrying with him.</t6211> <t6212>It is also a similar pass, allowing him, his daughter, and the child to pass through the city gates and borders at any time! See? − Yes! − Perhaps Dr. Manette obtained this paper yesterday, as a last resort to prevent any misfortune.</t6212> <t6213>What date is it signed? But it doesn't matter; don't waste time finding out; keep it safe along with my pass and yours.</t6213> <t6214>Now, listen to me!</t6214> <t6215>Until one or two hours ago, I never thought the doctor had such a pass.</t6215> <t6216>The pass is still valid until it expires.</t6216> <t6217>But it may soon expire, and I have reason to believe so, certainly.</t6217>
<t6218>− They are not in any danger, are they? −</t6218> <t6219>They are in extreme danger.</t6219> <t6220>They risk being denounced by Madame Defarge.</t6220> <t6221>I heard it from her own mouth.</t6221> <t6222>Tonight, I overheard her words which made me clearly see the danger awaiting them.</t6222>
<t6223>Without delay, immediately after that I went to meet the spy.</t6223> <t6224>He confirmed it to me.</t6224> <t6225>He knew of a woodcutter, living next to the prison wall, who was under the control of the Defarges, and he had informed Madame Defarge that he had seen Lucie frequenting that place... he did not mention Lucie's name... saw Lucie signaling and gesturing to the prisoner.</t6225> <t6226>It was very clear that this was previously a pretext for a common crime, conspiring with a prisoner, which would endanger Lucie's life... and perhaps her child's as well...</t6226>
<t6227>because both were seen standing there.</t6227> <t6228>Don't panic like that.</t6228>
<t6229>He will save everyone.</t6229>
<t6230>− God help us save them, Carton! But how? −</t6230> <t6231>I will tell you how.</t6231> <t6232>Everything depends on you and there is no one better.</t6232> <t6233>This denunciation will certainly not happen from now until the day after tomorrow; perhaps not even in two or three days; but a week later, it is possible.</t6233> <t6234>You know that even mourning, or sympathizing with a victim of the guillotine, is a serious crime.</t6234> <t6235>Lucie and her father will certainly be guilty of this, and that woman, with her deep-seated, indescribable hatred, will be waiting to denounce them further to strengthen her position and to ensure the conviction.</t6235> <t6236>Do you understand what I mean? −</t6236> <t6237>Listening very carefully, and believing in your words so much that, hearing you speak, we forget all this sorrow, - Mr. Lorry touched the back of Dr. Manette's chair.</t6237>
<t6238>− You have money, and you can buy the fastest means to get to the coast to undertake the journey.</t6238> <t6239>A few days ago, you had already prepared your part to return to England.</t6239> <t6240>Early tomorrow morning, you must arrange for horses and carriages to be ready so you can depart exactly at two in the afternoon.</t6240>
<t6241>− It will be taken care of! Carton's enthusiastic and infectious demeanor made Mr. Lorry feel invigorated and as spry as a young man.</t6241>
<t6242>− He is a noble man.</t6242> <t6243>I said that no one could be more reliable, didn't I?</t6243> <t6244>Tonight, tell Lucie what you know about the danger that awaits and involves both her father and her child.</t6244> <t6245>Emphasize that because Lucie is willing to die with her husband.</t6245> <t6246>- He hesitated for a moment and then continued.</t6246> <t6247>- For the sake of the child and her father, urge Lucie to leave Paris immediately, at that hour, you and the whole family will go with her.</t6247> <t6248>Say that this is her husband's final arrangement.</t6248> <t6249>Tell Lucie that everyone is relying on this, more than she can imagine or hope for.</t6249>
<t6250>According to him, would her father in this unfortunate situation comply with his daughter's wishes? −</t6250> <t6251>I am sure he would.</t6251>
<t6252>− I think so too.</t6252> <t6253>Just quietly and silently prepare everything right here in the yard, even have you sit ready in the car.</t6253> <t6254>The moment I come to see you, I get in the car and we leave immediately.</t6254>
<t6255>− So, in any situation, we have to wait for you? −</t6255> <t6256>You have already kept my passport along with everyone else's, and you must reserve a place for me.</t6256> <t6257>Without any hesitation, I will leave immediately for England when I arrive! − Oh, - Mr. Lorry tightly grasped Carton's calm and determined hand, - then everything doesn't just rely on this old man alone, but we also have a passionate young man by our side.</t6257>
<t6258>− With God's help, you will be fulfilled!</t6258> <t6259>You must promise me firmly that nothing can change the plan we have committed to here.</t6259>
<t6260>− Certainly, Carton.</t6260>
<t6261>− Tomorrow, you must remember these words; if you change the plan or delay for any reason, you will not be able to save anyone and will certainly cause many people to sacrifice their lives.</t6261>
<t6262>− I will remember.</t6262> <t6263>I hope to fulfill my part well.</t6263>
<t6264>− And I hope to fulfill my part completely.</t6264> <t6265>Now, goodbye!</t6265> <t6266>Though he spoke with a solemn and sincere smile and even kissed the old man's hand, he did not leave immediately.</t6266> <t6267>He helped Mr. Lorry lift Dr. Manette, who had been sitting and rocking in front of the gradually dying embers in the fireplace, put on his hat and coat for the doctor, and soothed him to stop lamenting about having to find the hidden workbench with the shoes.</t6267> <t6268>He walked beside the doctor, guiding him to Lucie's courtyard, where that sorrowful girl still kept vigil through the dreadful night, the girl who had once been happy when he revealed his lonely heart to her.</t6268> <t6269>He stepped into the courtyard and stood alone for a few minutes, looking up at the light in her window.</t6269> <t6270>Before leaving, he sent a kiss on the wind to that place, and a final farewell.</t6270>
<t6271>13.</t6271> <t6272>Fifty-two</t6272>
<t6273>In the dark prison of Conciergerie, those who have been condemned await their fateful day, their number equal to the weeks of a year.</t6273> <t6274>Fifty-two people that evening will be swept away by the current of the city into the boundless sea.</t6274> <t6275>They have not yet left the dungeon, but new occupants have already been assigned; their blood has not yet mingled with the blood spilled yesterday, but the blood that will mix with theirs tomorrow has already been chosen.</t6275>
<t6276>Fifty-two people have been sentenced.</t6276> <t6277>From the seventy-year-old tax collector whose wealth could not buy his life, to the twenty-year-old seamstress whose poor and obscure status could not save her future.</t6277>
<t6278>The plague, originating from the cruel and indifferent habits of humans, will seize victims from all walks of life; and the terrifying moral madness, born from indescribable suffering, unbearable oppression, and callous indifference, will strike down anyone.</t6278>
<t6279>Alone in the dungeon, Charles Darnay harbored no illusions since he left the courtroom.</t6279> <t6280>In every line of the narrative read there, he had heard his sentence.</t6280> <t6281>He understood clearly that no personal force could save him; he had been condemned by millions of people, and no one could do anything for him anymore.</t6281>
<t6282>However, he did not easily accept the fate awaiting him as the image of his beloved wife's face remained vividly imprinted in his mind.</t6282> <t6283>He clung tightly to life, unwilling to let go; if one hand grew weary and lost its grip slightly, the other hand would grasp even tighter; and when one hand, having exhausted its strength to hold on to life, loosened its grip, the other hand would hold firmly.</t6283> <t6284>Thoughts surged through his mind, and the passionate beating of his heart did not allow him to surrender to death.</t6284> <t6285>If at any moment he felt discouraged by the thought of his wife becoming a widow and his children becoming orphans, he would see giving up as selfish and continue to resist.</t6285>
<t6286>But that was only at the beginning.</t6286> <t6287>Soon after, he realized that the death he had to face was not shameful at all, and he felt more encouraged when he thought about how many people had walked that unjust path daily, and they still bravely tread upon death.</t6287> <t6288>Then he thought that it was his own calm resilience that would help his loved ones live peacefully in the future.</t6288> <t6289>So gradually, he felt more at ease and could think of happier things for his peace of mind.</t6289>
<t6290>Before nightfall on the day he was sentenced to death, Darnay was in that calm state of mind.</t6290> <t6291>Allowed to buy paper, pen, and a lamp, he sat down to write letters until the prison mandated lights out.</t6291>
<t6292>He wrote a long letter to Lucie, expressing that he was completely unaware of her father's imprisonment until he heard it from her, and that neither he nor she knew that the ones responsible for this suffering were his own father and uncle until they heard the court read those papers.</t6292><t6293>He explained to her that concealing from her the name he had renounced was a condition—now clear—that her father had attached to his daughter's marriage contract, and it was a promise he had fulfilled on the morning of the wedding.</t6293><t6294>He begged her, for the sake of Dr. Manette, never to try to find out whether her father had forgotten the existence of that testament or had been reminded of it (temporarily or permanently) by the story of the Tower of London prison he had told one Sunday afternoon under the shade of the plane tree in their garden.</t6294><t6295>If Dr. Manette remembered anything about that testament, he would surely believe it had been destroyed along with the Bastille prison, as he had never heard any mention of those papers among the remnants of the prisoners that the crowd had found and displayed to the world.</t6295><t6296>He implored—though he added that he knew this was unnecessary—that she console Dr. Manette with all the affection she could muster for her father, because he had done nothing to blame himself for, and in fact, he had only selflessly united her and him.</t6296><t6297>At the end of the letter, after thanking her for giving him all her love and happiness, and after advising her to overcome her sorrow to care for their beloved child, he asked her to think of their reunion in Heaven to comfort her old father.</t6297>
<t6298>The letter to Dr. Manette, he also wrote with that intention, but he entrusted his wife and children to the doctor's care.</t6298> <t6299>He wrote very strong words relying on the doctor with the hope that his father-in-law would escape all the depressing and dangerous recollections of past writings that he foresaw the doctor would inevitably be troubled by.</t6299>
<t6300>Write to Mr. Lorry, entrusting everyone to him and explaining his property matters.</t6300> <t6301>Then, he adds a few lines of gratitude and affection at the end of the letter, and it's done.</t6301> <t6302>Darnay never thought of Carton.</t6302> <t6303>His mind was filled with images of other people, not once remembering that friend.</t6303>
<t6304>He managed to finish writing the letters before having to extinguish the light.</t6304> <t6305>As he lay down on the straw bed, he thought he was ready to die.</t6305>
<t6306>But life calls him back and manifests in many radiant forms.</t6306> <t6307>Free and happy, he returns to the old house in Soho (though inside it resembles nothing like the real house), somehow escaping death, joyfully reunited with Lucie, and she tells him that all the hardships endured were just a dream, and he had never left at all.</t6307> <t6308>For a moment, he forgets everything, then finds himself sentenced to death and returns to her, dying peacefully, but nothing changes in him.</t6308> <t6309>Another moment of forgetfulness, and he wakes up in a misty morning, not knowing where he is or what has happened, until he suddenly realizes, "Today is the day I die!".</t6309>
<t6310>He had gone through such moments until the day when fifty-two heads would fall.</t6310> <t6311>At this moment, although he was calm and hoped to face death with silent bravery, new thoughts emerged in his mind, causing him concern.</t6311>
<t6312>He had never seen the instrument that would end his life.</t6312> <t6313>How tall was it compared to the ground, how many steps led up to it, where would he stand, how would he be pushed, were the hands touching him stained with blood, which direction would his face be turned, would he be the first or the last?...</t6313> <t6314>Even though he didn't want to, such questions kept intruding into his mind incessantly.</t6314> <t6315>They had nothing to do with fear; he was not afraid at all.</t6315> <t6316>On the contrary, they stemmed from a strange longing that kept haunting him, a desire to know what to do when the time came; a desire so immense compared to the fleeting moments on the scaffold; a bewilderment as if another soul, not him, was trying to understand.</t6316>
<t6317>The moments kept passing by as he paced back and forth, the clock striking chimes that he would never hear again.</t6317> <t6318>Nine o'clock gone forever, ten o'clock gone forever, eleven o'clock gone forever, twelve o'clock about to pass.</t6318> <t6319>After a difficult struggle with the strange thoughts that had disturbed his mind, he finally managed to overcome them.</t6319>
<t6320>He walked back and forth, silently calling the names of his loved ones.</t6320> <t6321>The most uncomfortable inner conflicts had ended.</t6321> <t6322>He could walk back and forth, free from disturbing thoughts, to pray for himself and his loved ones.</t6322>
<t6323>Twelve o'clock, gone forever.</t6323>
<t6324>He had been informed that the final hour was three o'clock, and he knew that they would call him before that time because the carts carrying the condemned would rumble slowly and heavily through the streets.</t6324> <t6325>Therefore, he resolved that by two o'clock he must strengthen his own spirit firmly so that he could then bolster the spirits of others.</t6325>
<t6326>Steadily pacing back and forth, with arms crossed over his chest, a completely different person from the prisoner who once paced in the La Force prison before, he heard the clock strike one without any surprise.</t6326>
<t6327>An hour passed like every other hour.</t6327> <t6328>Wholeheartedly thanking God for allowing him to regain his composure, he thought to himself, "Just one more hour," and continued walking.</t6328>
<t6329>There were footsteps in the stone-paved corridor outside the prison cell.</t6329> <t6330>He stopped.</t6330>
<t6331>The sound of a key being inserted into the lock, and turning.</t6331> <t6332>The door had not yet opened when a voice was heard speaking softly, in English: −</t6332> <t6333>He has no idea I'm here; I've been avoiding him for a long time.</t6333>
<t6334>You go in alone; I will wait nearby.</t6334> <t6335>Don't waste time! The door opened and closed quickly, and standing there opposite him, silently, attentively, with a fleeting smile on his face, a warning finger placed on his lips, was Sydney Carton.</t6335>
<t6336>Carton's face showed an unusually radiant expression, making the prisoner Darnay think for a moment that it was a ghost appearing from his imagination.</t6336> <t6337>But Carton spoke, and it was indeed his voice; Carton took the prisoner's hand, and it was truly his hand that was gripping tightly.</t6337>
<t6338>− You couldn't have imagined that it would be me you met and not someone else?</t6338> <t6339>Carton said.</t6339>
<t6340>− I can't believe it's you.</t6340> <t6341>Even now, I still don't believe it.</t6341>
<t6342>Not you...</t6342> <t6343>- A sudden worry sprang into Darnay's mind.</t6343> <t6344>- ...</t6344> <t6345>You haven't been imprisoned, have you? − No.</t6345> <t6346>By chance, I have authority over a jailer here, and thanks to that, I am able to stand before you.</t6346> <t6347>She... your wife asked me to come, Mr. Darnay.</t6347>
<t6348>The prisoner tightly grasped Carton's hand.</t6348>
<t6349>− I am conveying her request to you.</t6349>
<t6350>− What is it? −</t6350> <t6351>The most urgent and serious plea she had spoken in the most plaintive voice that he was surely too familiar with and missed dearly.</t6351>
<t6352>The prisoner slightly turned his face away.</t6352>
<t6353>− There is no time left, don't ask why I am passing on the message or want to know the details; it's very urgent.</t6353> <t6354>You must follow...</t6354> <t6355>Take off the shoes you are wearing, and put on my shoes.</t6355>
<t6356>There is a chair placed against the room wall, behind the prisoner.</t6356>
<t6357>Carton swiftly pushed Darnay to sit down, then he stood up straight, his shoes already removed.</t6357>
<t6358>− Bring me my shoes.</t6358> <t6359>Do it, use all your willpower. Quickly! −</t6359> <t6360>Carton, there is no way to escape from here; it's impossible to escape.</t6360> <t6361>You will die with me.</t6361> <t6362>It's madness.</t6362>
<t6363>− It would be madness if I asked you to escape; but did I say that? When I tell you to walk out that door, then call me mad and stay here.</t6363> <t6364>Exchange your tie with mine; exchange your coat with mine.</t6364> <t6365>While you are putting on the coat, let me untie your hair ribbon, and you must shake your head to make your hair as disheveled as mine! With extraordinary swiftness, and with a nearly superhuman strength of will and action, Carton forced Darnay to change clothes.</t6365> <t6366>The prisoner was like a child in his hands.</t6366>
<t6367>− Carton! Carton! This is madness.</t6367> <t6368>It's impossible to escape, never has anyone escaped, many have tried and always failed.</t6368> <t6369>Please don't let my bitter fate drag you to your death.</t6369>
<t6370>− Darnay, did I ask you to leave the room?</t6370> <t6371>When I say so, then refuse.</t6371> <t6372>There is paper and ink on the table.</t6372> <t6373>Can you still hold a pen steadily?</t6373> <t6374>I was writing when you came in.</t6374>
<t6375>− Then pick up the pen again and write as I dictate.</t6375> <t6376>Quickly, my friend, quickly! Clutching his bewildered forehead, Darnay sat down at the table.</t6376> <t6377>Carton, with his right hand placed on his chest, stood nearby.</t6377>
<t6378>− Write exactly as I read.</t6378>
<t6379>− Send it to whom? −</t6379> <t6380>No one. - Carton's hand still rested on his chest.</t6380>
<t6381>− Write the date? −</t6381> <t6382>No.</t6382>
<t6383>The prisoner looked up after each question.</t6383> <t6384>With his hand still on his chest, Carton looked down.</t6384>
<t6385>− “If you remember,” - Carton dictated for Darnay to write, - “the private words between us long ago, you will understand immediately when you read these lines.</t6385> <t6386>You will remember those private words, I know.</t6386> <t6387>Because you are not one to easily forget.” He intended to lower his hand from his chest when the prisoner happened to look up in confusion at this urgent matter.</t6387> <t6388>Carton's hand stopped, gripping something tightly.</t6388>
<t6389>− Have you finished writing "easily forgotten"? - Carton asked.</t6389>
<t6390>− Done.</t6390> <t6391>Is that a weapon in your hand? −</t6391> <t6392>No, I don't have any weapons.</t6392>
<t6393>− What are you holding in your hand? −</t6393> <t6394>You will know right away.</t6394> <t6395>Keep writing; just a few more words.</t6395> <t6396>- Carton continued reading.</t6396> <t6397>- “How grateful I am that the time has come when I can prove the old saying.</t6397> <t6398>I do it without any regret or sorrow.” - As he read, he stared intently at the writer, Carton's hand slowly and discreetly moved closer to Darnay's face.</t6398>
<t6399>The pen fell from Darnay's fingers onto the table, and he stared blankly around.</t6399>
<t6400>− What kind of smell is that? - Darnay asked.</t6400>
<t6401>− A breath? − A strange breath wafted across my face? −</t6401> <t6402>I don't see anything; there's nothing strange here.</t6402> <t6403>Pick up the pen and finish writing.</t6403> <t6404>Quickly, quickly! As if his memory had deteriorated, or his faculties had become disordered, the prisoner tried to concentrate.</t6404> <t6405>While Darnay looked up with a dull gaze and his breath changed to rapid gasps, Carton still stared intently at Darnay, his hand once again placed inside his coat.</t6405>
<t6406>− Hurry up, hurry!</t6406> <t6407>The prisoner bent down over the paper again.</t6407>
<t6408>− "If not for this opportunity," - Carton's hand cautiously and discreetly lowered, - "we will never have another chance."</t6408> <t6409>"If not for this opportunity," - Carton's hand next to the prisoner's face, - "so many difficulties will pile up later."</t6409> <t6410>"If not for this opportunity..." - Carton looked at the pen and saw the writing becoming illegible.</t6410>
<t6411>Carton's hand no longer moved to his chest.</t6411> <t6412>The prisoner stood up abruptly with a reproachful look, but his nose was already covered by Carton's right hand, and his waist was tightly held by Carton's left hand.</t6412> <t6413>Darnay weakly resisted for a few seconds against the person who risked his life to save him; but after just a minute, Darnay lay unconscious on the floor.</t6413>
<t6414>With swift hands and a resolute heart, Carton donned the clothes the prisoner had taken off, combed his hair, and tied it with the ribbon that had tied the prisoner's hair.</t6414> <t6415>Then he called softly: − Come in! Quickly! - And the spy Barsad entered.</t6415> <t6416>- See?</t6416> <t6417>Carton looked up.</t6417> <t6418>He was kneeling on one knee beside the unconscious prisoner, placing the letter into his coat. - Is your risk too great? −</t6418> <t6419>Mr. Carton, - the spy replied with a hesitant snap of his fingers, my risk does not lie there, in this matter, if you do as promised.</t6419>
<t6420>− Don't worry. I swear I will do exactly as I said.</t6420>
<t6421>− That's how it must be, Mr. Carton, if the story of beheading fifty-two people is true.</t6421> <t6422>If you keep dressing like that and do as you say, then I am not afraid of anything.</t6422>
<t6423>− No need to be afraid! Soon I will no longer be a danger to you, and as for the others, God willing, they will quickly leave this place!</t6423> <t6424>Now call someone to help take me to the car.</t6424>
<t6425>− You? - The detective worriedly.</t6425>
<t6426>− So this person, the one whose clothes I changed.</t6426> <t6427>You exited through the gate you brought me in, right? −</t6427> <t6428>Of course.</t6428>
<t6429>− I was weak and dizzy when you brought me in, and now as you take me out, I have fainted.</t6429> <t6430>I cannot bear this eternal farewell.</t6430> <t6431>Such things often happen here, very often, life and death are up to you.</t6431> <t6432>Quickly! Call for help! −</t6432> <t6433>You swear not to betray me, right? - The spy trembled as he hesitated one last time.</t6433>
<t6434>− This man! - Carton said, stomping his foot.</t6434> <t6435>- I have sworn already, proceed without wasting any more precious time! You yourself must take this person to that courtyard, you know the place, you yourself must put this person into the waiting carriage there, you yourself must let Mr. Lorry see this person, tell him that just fresh air is enough for this person to recover, no need for any medicine, remind him of my instructions last night, along with his promise last night, and set off immediately!</t6435> <t6436>The spy withdrew and Carton sat at the table, holding his head in his hands.</t6436> <t6437>The spy returned immediately with two other people.</t6437>
<t6438>− What's going on here? - One person said while looking at the body lying on the floor.</t6438> <t6439>- Too emotional upon seeing his friend win the Guillotine lottery?</t6439> <t6440>They lifted the unconscious person, placed him on a stretcher they had brought to the door, and then bent down to lift it up.</t6440>
<t6441>− There's no more time, Evrémonde, - the spy said in a warning tone.</t6441>
<t6442>− I know well, - Carton replied. - Please take care of my friend and leave me alone.</t6442>
<t6443>− Then let's go, you guys, - Barsad said. - Lift this man up and let's go!</t6443> <t6444>The door closed and only Carton was left alone.</t6444> <t6445>Using all his hearing, he stood up, straining to catch any sounds that might indicate suspicion or alarm.</t6445> <t6446>There were none.</t6446> <t6447>The sound of keys turning, the door slamming shut, footsteps receding down the corridors; no loud cries, no unusual hurried footsteps.</t6447> <t6448>Feeling more at ease, after a while he sat down again and continued to listen until the clock struck two.</t6448>
<t6449>Then he began to hear sounds that he was not afraid of, for he himself had given them a sacred meaning.</t6449> <t6450>Many prison doors were opened in succession, and finally the door to his cell.</t6450> <t6451>A jailer holding a list in his hand looked at it and briefly said, "Follow me, Evrémonde!"</t6451> <t6452>And he followed to a large, gloomy room in the distance.</t6452> <t6453>That day was a dreary winter day, with darkness both outside and inside, he could only faintly see the others who were brought here to have their hands tied.</t6453> <t6454>Some stood, some sat.</t6454> <t6455>Some were crying, panicking; but they were few.</t6455> <t6456>Most were silent, their eyes looking down at the floor.</t6456>
<t6457>While he was standing in a dark corner of the wall and some others from the list of fifty-two people were brought in after him, a passerby suddenly stopped and hugged him as if they had known each other before.</t6457>
<t6458>Carton was secretly terrified of being discovered; but the person continued on.</t6458> <t6459>Just a moment later, a girl he saw sitting on the bench suddenly stood up and walked towards him.</t6459> <t6460>With a figure still retaining the features of youth, a gentle face unadorned exposing pale skin and wide, patient eyes, the girl started a conversation: −</t6460> <t6461>Citizen Evrémonde, - she touched him with her cold hand. - I am a poor seamstress, who was imprisoned in La Force with you.</t6461>
<t6462>− That's right, - he whispered in response. - I forgot, what were you accused of? −</t6462> <t6463>Conspiracy. Even though God knows I am completely innocent.</t6463> <t6464>How could that be? Who could conspire against someone as weak and poor as me?</t6464> <t6465>Her desperate smile moved him, his eyes welling up with tears.</t6465>
<t6466>− I am not afraid to die, Citizen Evrémonde, but I have done nothing.</t6466> <t6467>I am ready to die if it is useful for the Republic, which has done many good things for the poor; but I do not understand why it has come to this, Citizen Evrémonde.</t6467> <t6468>I am such a poor and weak person! That poor girl moved him deeply, the last person in this world to make his heart ache.</t6468>
<t6469>− I heard that you have been set free, Citizen Evrémonde.</t6469> <t6470>I hope that is true? −</t6470> <t6471>It is true.</t6471> <t6472>But I was re-arrested and sentenced.</t6472>
<t6473>− If I were to ride with you, Citizen Evrémonde, may I hold your hand? I am not afraid, but I am weak and small, and it would give me more courage.</t6473>
<t6474>When those patient eyes looked up, he suddenly noticed the doubt and then the astonishment in them.</t6474> <t6475>He tightly grasped her thin, hungry, and weary fingers, bringing them to his lips.</t6475>
<t6476>− You died in his place? - The girl whispered.</t6476>
<t6477>− And because of his wife and children.</t6477> <t6478>Shh! That's right.</t6478>
<t6479>− Oh, may I hold your brave hand, stranger? −</t6479> <t6480>Shh! Alright, my poor sister, let's hold hands until the very end.</t6480>
<t6481>Just like the shadows enveloping the prison, at that same early afternoon hour, darkness was descending upon the city gate, covering the crowd surrounding it as a four-horse carriage leaving Paris stopped for inspection.</t6481>
<t6482>− Who is going there? Who is in the car? Present your papers!</t6482> <t6483>The papers were presented for inspection.</t6483>
<t6484>− Alexandre Manette.</t6484> <t6485>Doctor. French. Who is he?</t6485> <t6486>That's him; a finger pointed at an absent-minded, helpless old man, muttering incoherent words.</t6486>
<t6487>− Clearly, this Citizen Doctor is mentally unstable?</t6487> <t6488>Can't withstand the fever of the Revolution?</t6488> <t6489>It's beyond his endurance.</t6489>
<t6490>− Hmph! Many people can still bear it. Lucie.</t6490> <t6491>This man's daughter.</t6491> <t6492>French. Where is she? There she is.</t6492>
<t6493>− Surely it is.</t6493> <t6494>Lucie, the wife of Evrémonde, right?</t6494> <t6495>Exactly.</t6495>
<t6496>− Hmph! Evrémonde has been assigned elsewhere, Lucie, her daughter.</t6496>
<t6497>The Englishman. Is this it?</t6497> <t6498>It's the girl.</t6498>
<t6499>− Kiss me, little Evrémonde.</t6499> <t6500>There, you have kissed a good Republican; a new experience for your family; don't forget! Sydney Carton.</t6500> <t6501>Lawyer. Englishman. Who is he?</t6501> <t6502>He is lying there, in the corner of the carriage.</t6502> <t6503>A finger points in that direction.</t6503>
<t6504>− This English barrister seems to be unconscious? Everyone hopes that the fresh air will help him regain consciousness.</t6504> <t6505>It is clear that he is unwell, and he has just sorrowfully bid farewell to a friend who was not well-liked by the Republic.</t6505>
<t6506>− Just because of that? It's nothing to make a fuss about! Many people are not in the favor of the Republic and have to stick their heads into the guillotine.</t6506> <t6507>Jarvis Lorry.</t6507> <t6508>Bank employee.</t6508> <t6509>Englishman. Who is he? − He is me.</t6509> <t6510>Of course, the last one.</t6510>
<t6511>It was Mr. Jarvis Lorry who answered all the questions.</t6511> <t6512>It was Mr. Jarvis Lorry who got off the carriage and stood leaning against the door to answer a group of officials.</t6512> <t6513>This group leisurely walked around the carriage, leisurely climbed onto the coachman's seat, and examined the few pieces of luggage on the roof; the villagers loitered around, crowded near the carriage doors, and looked inside with longing eyes; a child being held by its mother stretched out its short arm as if wanting to touch the wife of the nobleman who had gone to the guillotine.</t6513>
<t6514>− Check the documents again, Jarvis Lorry, they have been signed and confirmed.</t6514>
<t6515>− Can we go, Citizen? −</t6515> <t6516>You are permitted.</t6516> <t6517>Whip the horses, driver! Safe journey! −</t6517> <t6518>Farewell, Citizens...</t6518> <t6519>And the first danger has passed! It was Mr. Jarvis Lorry speaking as he clasped his hands, eyes raised to the sky.</t6519> <t6520>Inside the carriage, there was fear, the sound of crying, and the heavy breathing of the unconscious traveler.</t6520>
<t6521>− Why is the car moving so slowly? Can't we tell them to go faster? - Lucie asked, holding onto the old man.</t6521>
<t6522>− That would be like running away, my dear.</t6522> <t6523>We must not urge them too much; doing so would arouse suspicion.</t6523>
<t6524>− Look behind, look behind, see if we are being chased? −</t6524> <t6525>The road is clear, my dear.</t6525> <t6526>So far, no one is chasing us.</t6526>
<t6527>The carriage passed through clusters of scattered houses, solitary farms, ruined buildings, dye works; tanneries, and similar places, then open fields and roads lined with bare trees.</t6527> <t6528>The cobblestones were uneven under the horse's hooves, then deep mud engulfed the sides of the carriage.</t6528> <t6529>At times, the carriage veered into the slippery mud to avoid the uneven stones in the middle of the road; at other times, the carriage got stuck in muddy ditches.</t6529> <t6530>The agony of impatience was so great that in a frantic panic, those in the carriage just wanted to escape and run away - hide - do anything as long as they didn't have to stop.</t6530>
<t6531>Leaving the open fields, the carriage passed through ruined buildings, solitary farms, dye works; tanneries, and similar places, then again through clusters of a few scattered houses, and leafless tree-lined roads.</t6531> <t6532>Have these people deceived us into turning the carriage back by another route?</t6532> <t6533>Is this not the place we crossed twice already? Thank God, it is not.</t6533> <t6534>A village.</t6534> <t6535>Look behind, look behind, see if we are being followed? Hush! We've reached the relay station! Leisurely, the four horses were unharnessed; leisurely, the carriage stood in the narrow road, no longer drawn by horses, and incapable of moving; leisurely, four new horses appeared, one by one; leisurely, two new grooms followed the horses, drinking wine and coiling their whips; leisurely, the two old grooms counted money, miscalculated the total, and were dissatisfied with the result.</t6535> <t6536>All the while, our fearful hearts were beating in a rhythm even more urgent than the fastest galloping horse in the world.</t6536>
<t6537>Finally, the two new horsemen mounted their saddles, while the two old ones stayed behind.</t6537>
<t6538>The carriage once again traversed through villages, up hills and down slopes, and ran on the waterlogged lowlands.</t6538> <t6539>Suddenly, the two coachmen waved their hands and talked animatedly, and the carriage came to an abrupt stop, causing the four horses to almost rear up.</t6539>
<t6540>Is someone chasing us? − Hey! You in the carriage! Speak up! −</t6540> <t6541>What's the matter? - Mr. Lorry asked, looking out the carriage window.</t6541>
<t6542>− How many people did they say? −</t6542> <t6543>I don't understand what you mean? − ...</t6543> <t6544>At the final station.</t6544> <t6545>How many people are going to the guillotine today? −</t6545> <t6546>Fifty-two.</t6546>
<t6547>− I was right! A beautiful number! My fellow Citizen here keeps saying it's forty-two; it deserves ten more heads.</t6547> <t6548>The guillotine is magnificent.</t6548> <t6549>I like it that way. Hey! Move on! Hoo! The night is falling.</t6549> <t6550>The unconscious traveler began to move; he was regaining consciousness; and he spoke coherently; he thought he was still with his friend; he asked his friend, by name, what he was holding in his hand.</t6550> <t6551>Oh merciful God, have mercy on us, and help us! Watch out, watch out, are we being chased?</t6551> <t6552>Only the wind whistling behind; and the clouds swirling behind, and the moon plunging behind, and the wild night chasing them; besides that, up to this moment, nothing was chasing them.</t6552>
<t6553>14.</t6553> <t6554>The last knitting stitch</t6554>
<t6555>At the same time, fifty-two people were awaiting their fate, Madame Defarge organized a dark and terrifying meeting with the Goddess of Retribution and Jacques Three of the Revolutionary Tribunal.</t6555> <t6556>Madame Defarge did not consult with these executors at the tavern but in the hut of the sawyer, who was formerly a road mender.</t6556> <t6557>The sawyer was not allowed to participate in the meeting but stood waiting at a distance, like a lowly subordinate who could only speak when permitted, and could only have an opinion when needed.</t6557>
<t6558>− But our Defarge, - Jacques Ba said, - is clearly a good Republican, isn't he? Why so? −</t6558> <t6559>No one is better in this France, - the shrill, rapid protest of the Goddess of Vengeance replied.</t6559>
<t6560>− Quiet now, Goddess of Vengeance, - Madame Defarge gently frowned and placed her hand on her assistant's lips - listen to me.</t6560> <t6561>My husband, Citizen Defarge, is a good Republican and a brave man; he deserves to be valued and trusted by the Republic.</t6561> <t6562>But my husband also has a weakness, he is so soft-hearted that he feels pity for that old doctor.</t6562>
<t6563>− What a pity, - Jacques Ba said gruffly, shaking his head doubtfully, his cruel fingers hovering over the hungry mouth.</t6563> <t6564>Then he is not exactly a good Citizen; truly unfortunate.</t6564>
<t6565>− You see, - said Madame Defarge, - I don't care about this doctor.</t6565> <t6566>Whether he loses his head or not, it doesn't matter to me.</t6566> <t6567>But the Evrémonde family must be exterminated, his wife and child must follow him to the grave.</t6567>
<t6568>− His wife has a head fit for the guillotine, - Jacques Three bellowed.</t6568> <t6569>- I have seen the heads of women with blue eyes and blonde hair, and each one was appealing when Samson raised it.</t6569>
<t6570>This bloodthirsty person speaks like a gourmet.</t6570> <t6571>Madame Defarge bowed her head and thought for a moment.</t6571>
<t6572>− The child too, - said Jacques Ba, savoring each word with delight, - also has blond hair and blue eyes.</t6572> <t6573>I rarely see children being sent to the guillotine.</t6573>
<t6574>It must be known! - In short, - Madame Defarge had passed her moment of reflection, - in this matter, I do not trust my husband.</t6574> <t6575>Since last night, not only do I feel that I cannot disclose the details of this plan to him; but I also see that if I hesitate, there is a risk he will alert them to escape.</t6575>
<t6576>− Absolutely not, - Jacques Ba exclaimed, - no one is allowed to escape.</t6576> <t6577>At the moment, we have only half the number that needs to be executed.</t6577> <t6578>We should be executing one hundred and twenty heads each day.</t6578>
<t6579>− In short, - Madam Defarge continued, - my husband has no reason like I do to exterminate this entire family, and I have no reason like he does to pity the old doctor.</t6579> <t6580>Therefore, I must act on my own.</t6580> <t6581>Come here, little Citizen.</t6581>
<t6582>The sawyer, holding a red hat in his hand, approached, respectfully and obsequiously before Madame Defarge out of fear of death.</t6582>
<t6583>− Citizen Short, - Madame Defarge's voice was cold, - regarding the matter of Madame Evrémonde signaling to the prisoners; are you ready to testify today? −</t6583> <t6584>Yes, yes, why not! - The wood-sawyer exclaimed. - Every day, rain or shine, from two to four in the afternoon, she always signals, sometimes with a child, sometimes alone.</t6584> <t6585>I know for sure.</t6585> <t6586>I saw it with my own eyes.</t6586>
<t6587>He spoke while gesticulating wildly, as if mimicking various random signs that he actually did not see.</t6587>
<t6588>− The scheme is clear, - said Jacques Three. - There's no mistaking it! −</t6588> <t6589>Is the jury certain of that? - Madame Defarge turned to ask this person, with a sinister smile.</t6589>
<t6590>− Trust the patriotic jury, Citizeness.</t6590> <t6591>I vouch for the Citizen jurors.</t6591>
<t6592>− Now let's see, - Madame Defarge pondered again. - Another matter! Can I spare the old doctor for my husband's sake?</t6592> <t6593>I don't care about him.</t6593> <t6594>Can I spare him? −</t6594> <t6595>He counts as a head too, - Jacques Three whispered. - At the moment, we are short of heads; it would be a waste to let him go, I think.</t6595>
<t6596>− He also made signs along with his daughter when I met her, - Mrs. Defarge reasoned.</t6596> <t6597>- I cannot accuse one without accusing the other; and I cannot remain silent and leave this matter entirely to that man, Citizen Short.</t6597> <t6598>Because I am also a legitimate witness.</t6598>
<t6599>The Goddess of Vengeance and Jacques Three loudly competed to praise Madame Defarge as the most wonderful and admirable witness.</t6599> <t6600>Not to be outdone, the short Citizen also called her a divine witness.</t6600>
<t6601>− You must accept the risks, - said Madame Defarge.</t6601> <t6602>- No, I cannot spare him!</t6602> <t6603>You have an appointment at three o'clock; you will go to see the execution of the people today...</t6603> <t6604>And you? This question was directed at the wood-sawyer, who hastily responded affirmatively and took the opportunity to add that he was the most enthusiastic Republican, and in fact, would be the most miserable Republican if anything prevented him from enjoying the pleasure of smoking his pipe every afternoon while watching the fun of the national razor.</t6604> <t6605>He said this so fervently that it could be suspected that he himself feared for his own safety every day and every hour; and from the dark look of contempt that Madame Defarge gave him, it seemed she might also be suspecting this.</t6605> <t6606>She said: − I also have business there.</t6606> <t6607>After it's all done, come see me at eight o'clock tonight, at Saint Antoine, and we will go denounce these people at my district's Committee.</t6607>
<t6608>The sawyer said he would be proud and honored to accompany Citizeness Defarge.</t6608> <t6609>Citizeness Defarge glared at him, and he nervously avoided her gaze like a frightened dog, retreating to stand among his pile of wood, hiding his embarrassment behind the handle of his saw.</t6609>
<t6610>Madame Defarge signaled to the juryman and the Vengeance to move closer to the door and explained her intention more clearly to them: −</t6610> <t6611>His wife will be at home now, waiting for her husband to die.</t6611> <t6612>She will mourn and grieve.</t6612> <t6613>She will be in a state of violating the laws of the Republic.</t6613>
<t6614>It will fully reveal its affection for the national enemy.</t6614> <t6615>I will go to its place.</t6615>
<t6616>−</t6616> <t6617>You are truly admirable; you are truly admirable! - Jacques Ba exclaimed joyfully.</t6617>
<t6618>− Oh, how adorable! - The Vengeance Goddess exclaimed as she hugged Madame Defarge.</t6618>
<t6619>− Bring my knitting, - Madame Defarge handed the items to her assistant, - and have it ready for me at my usual seat.</t6619> <t6620>Keep my seat as usual.</t6620> <t6621>Go there now, go immediately, because there will be more spectators today than usual.</t6621>
<t6622>− Ready to obey the leader, - The Vengeful Goddess eagerly said and kissed Madame Defarge on the cheek.</t6622> <t6623>- You won't be late, will you? −</t6623> <t6624>I will be there before it starts.</t6624>
<t6625>− And before the executioner's cart arrives.</t6625> <t6626>Make sure to come early, dear, the Vengeance Goddess called after her, as the other woman had already stepped onto the street - before the executioner's cart arrives! With a slight wave to indicate she had heard and would surely be on time, Madame Defarge walked through the mud and rounded the corner of the prison wall.</t6626> <t6627>The Vengeance Goddess and the juryman watched her, admiring the graceful figure and resolute spirit of the woman who was walking away.</t6627>
<t6628>In those times, the terrifying molding hand of fate had caused many women to become horribly corrupted, but none were as frightening as the cruel woman walking down the road.</t6628> <t6629>With a strong and tenacious personality, sharp and quick-witted, a heart of stone, and even her beauty exuding hatred and determination, anyone who saw her would immediately recognize her as a product of chaotic times.</t6629> <t6630>But from a young age, she harbored a deep awareness of injustice and profound class hatred, which the circumstances had turned into a fierce tiger.</t6630> <t6631>She knew no compassion.</t6631> <t6632>If she ever had any compassion, that sentiment had long since died.</t6632>
<t6633>It meant nothing to her that an innocent person had to die for the sins of their forefathers; she did not see this person but only saw the evil predecessor.</t6633> <t6634>It meant nothing to her that this person's wife would become a widow and this person's daughter would become an orphan.</t6634> <t6635>She only knew that the punishment was not enough, because they were natural enemies and her prey, therefore they had no right to live.</t6635> <t6636>Appealing to her was hopeless because this woman no longer had any compassion, not even for herself.</t6636>
<t6637>If she were to collapse in the middle of a battle she participated in, she wouldn't regret it; and if she herself were to be sent to the guillotine tomorrow, she would feel nothing but a fierce desire to behead the person who brought her to the scaffold.</t6637>
<t6638>That is the sentiment that Madame Defarge harbors beneath her tattered cloak.</t6638>
<t6639>The wrinkled cloth, draped haphazardly over her body to form a cloak, was peculiar, and her jet-black hair seemed even more lustrous under the coarse red hat.</t6639> <t6640>Hidden in her chest was a loaded pistol.</t6640> <t6641>Concealed at her waist was a sharpened short sword.</t6641> <t6642>Equipped as such, Madame Defarge set out with the confident stride of a determined person, with the comfortable grace of a woman who had been accustomed to walking barefoot on brown sand since childhood.</t6642>
<t6643>At this moment, as the carriage on the road was waiting to complete its journey, the escape plan for Miss Pross and Jerry Cruncher had been carefully devised; this was the pressing issue that had caused Mr. Lorry to worry the previous night.</t6643> <t6644>Having Miss Pross follow later would be the best way to lighten the load on the carriage and minimize the time spent on document checks and passenger interrogations; because the success of this escape depended on shaving off every second along the way.</t6644> <t6645>Finally, after careful consideration, he suggested that Miss Pross and Jerry, who were the two people free to leave the capital, should depart at three o'clock using the fastest carriage available at that time.</t6645>
<t6646>Without being burdened by luggage, they would quickly catch up with the four-horse carriage, overtake it, and run ahead to hire horses in advance; this way, they would save precious time during the night, which is usually when the most dreadful delays occur.</t6646>
<t6647>Seeing that this arrangement had the potential to aid the urgent situation, Ms. Pross gladly accepted.</t6647> <t6648>She and Jerry had seen Mr. Lorry's carriage depart, knew who Solomon had brought, endured ten tense and miserable minutes, and were now making the final arrangements to follow the earlier carriage.</t6648> <t6649>Meanwhile, Madame Defarge was making her way through the streets, getting closer and closer to the deserted house where only two servants were discussing.</t6649>
<t6650>− What do you plan to do now, Mr. Cruncher, - said Miss Pross, so tense that she didn't know how to move or speak.</t6650> <t6651>- What do you think about not departing from this courtyard?</t6651> <t6652>Another carriage leaving from here might arouse suspicion.</t6652>
<t6653>− What you said is right, - Cruncher replied. - Whether it's right or wrong, I'll do as you say.</t6653>
<t6654>− I am confused because I am both scared and hopeful for our dear loved ones, - Miss Pross cried.</t6654> <t6655>- And can you think of anything, dear Mr. Cruncher? −</t6655> <t6656>As for the future, there is a lifetime to think about it, - Cruncher replied, - I hope so.</t6656> <t6657>But right now, I am sure this head of mine can't think of anything.</t6657> <t6658>Would you be so kind as to listen to two promises and also oaths that I want to be acknowledged right at this moment of crisis? −</t6658> <t6659>Oh, Lord! - Miss Pross exclaimed, still sobbing, - acknowledge them immediately, speak right away so we can discuss, please speak quickly.</t6659>
<t6660>− First, - Cruncher trembled all over, speaking with a pale, serious face, - if those poor people get out of this, I will never do that job again, never! −</t6660> <t6661>Surely, Mr. Cruncher, you will never do it again, whatever it is, and I ask you not to specify what that thing is.</t6661>
<t6662>− No, ma'am, I won't say anything.</t6662> <t6663>Secondly, if those poor people get out of this, I will never again stop Mrs. Cruncher, my wife, from sitting down to pray, never!</t6663> <t6664>No matter what happens in your household, - Miss Pross tried to wipe her tears and calm down, - I am sure that Mrs. Cruncher has every right to do whatever she wants...</t6664> <t6665>Oh, my poor dear ones! −</t6665> <t6666>I even dare to say... - Cruncher continued in a long-winded and very worrying manner as if he were preaching, - ... and I want you to remember my words and tell Mrs. Cruncher...</t6666> <t6667>that my thoughts about her sitting down have changed and I sincerely hope that right now Mrs. Cruncher is at home sitting down.</t6667>
<t6668>− That's right, that's right!</t6668> <t6669>I hope so too, sir, - cried out Ms. Pross in despair, - and I hope she gets everything she wishes for.</t6669>
<t6670>− God will punish... - Cruncher kept saying, becoming more and more solemn, slower, and increasingly verbose, - ... if I say or do anything to harm these poor dear ones! God will punish if we do not sit down, if convenient, to pray for them to escape from this danger! God will punish, sister! I'm telling you, punish!</t6670> <t6671>- That was Cruncher's conclusion after rambling on without finding a better phrase.</t6671>
<t6672>Madame Defarge was still advancing on the road, getting closer and closer.</t6672>
<t6673>− If we can return to our homeland, - said Ms. Pross, - you can trust that I will tell Mrs. Cruncher everything I remember and understand from your very eloquent words; I will certainly testify that you were entirely sincere in this dreadful moment.</t6673> <t6674>Now, pray that we think of something!</t6674> <t6675>Dear Mr. Cruncher, let's think of a way! Meanwhile, Madame Defarge is still advancing on the road, getting closer and closer.</t6675>
<t6676>− If you go ahead, - said Miss Pross, - and prevent the carriage from coming here while waiting for me somewhere, wouldn't that be better?</t6676> <t6677>Cruncher thought that was the best way.</t6677>
<t6678>− Where can you wait for me? - Miss Pross asked.</t6678>
<t6679>Cruncher was so bewildered that he couldn't think of any place other than the Temple Bar gate. Alas! Temple Bar was all the way in London, hundreds of miles away, while Madame Defarge was already very close.</t6679>
<t6680>− By the church gate, - said Miss Pross.</t6680> <t6681>- Meet me there, near the church gate with the two towers, is that convenient for you? −</t6681> <t6682>Convenient, ma'am, - Cruncher replied.</t6682>
<t6683>− Then please, sir, - said Miss Pross, - go immediately to the post station and tell them to change the location.</t6683>
<t6684>− I'm worried about you staying here alone, - Cruncher hesitated, then shook his head.</t6684> <t6685>- What if something happens.</t6685>
<t6686>− Only God knows, - replied Miss Pross, - but don't worry about me.</t6686> <t6687>Meet me at the church, at three o'clock, or earlier if possible, I am sure that leaving from there will be better than leaving from here.</t6687> <t6688>I am sure of it.</t6688> <t6689>Go now! God bless you, Mr. Cruncher! Don't think about me, but think about the lives that are depending on the two of us!</t6689> <t6690>These words, along with Miss Pross's hands tightly grasping Cruncher's, earnestly pleading, convinced him.</t6690> <t6691>With a few encouraging nods, Cruncher immediately went to make arrangements, leaving Miss Pross alone as she had requested.</t6691>
<t6692>Miss Pross felt very relieved after thinking of a precautionary measure that was being implemented.</t6692> <t6693>Another comforting thought was that she had the necessary time to tidy up her appearance so as not to attract attention when going out.</t6693> <t6694>She looked at the clock.</t6694> <t6695>Two twenty.</t6695> <t6696>There was no time to waste, she had to get ready immediately.</t6696>
<t6697>In this chaotic emotion, Ms. Pross became afraid of being alone in the empty apartment and saw phantom faces looking out from every window frame.</t6697> <t6698>She then took a basin of cold water and began to wash her red and swollen eyes.</t6698> <t6699>Haunted by a burning fear, she dared not let the streaming water blur her vision for even a moment; she continually paused to look around to see if anyone was watching her.</t6699> <t6700>And during one such pause, she was startled and cried out upon seeing a figure standing in the room.</t6700>
<t6701>The pot fell to the floor and shattered, water spreading to Madame Defarge's feet. Through many harsh and bloody paths, those feet had arrived here.</t6701> <t6702>Coldly looking at Miss Pross, Madame Defarge asked: "Where is Evrémonde's wife?" Miss Pross suddenly remembered that all the doors of the room were open and would reveal the escape plan.</t6702> <t6703>Her first reaction was to close all the doors.</t6703> <t6704>All four doors leading to this room.</t6704> <t6705>Then she stood blocking the door to Lucie's private room.</t6705>
<t6706>The dark eyes of Madame Defarge followed the swift actions of Miss Pross and fixed on her when the four doors were tightly closed.</t6706> <t6707>Miss Pross had no beauty at all, the years had not tamed her stubbornness nor softened the rough features on her face; but she was also a tenacious woman in a different way, her eyes roamed over Madame Defarge, scrutinizing every bit.</t6707>
<t6708>− Your face is just like Satan's, - said Miss Pross, breathing heavily.</t6708> <t6709>- But you won't defeat me.</t6709> <t6710>I am an Englishwoman.</t6710>
<t6711>Madame Defarge looked at Miss Pross with contempt, but in that look, Miss Pross still recognized one thing: they were two adversaries.</t6711> <t6712>Madame Defarge saw that her opponent was a tough, tenacious woman, just as Mr. Lorry had realized many years ago when he first met the woman with the strong hands.</t6712> <t6713>Madame Defarge knew well that Miss Pross was a devoted friend to this family; and Miss Pross also knew all too well that Madame Defarge was the family's vicious enemy.</t6713>
<t6714>− On the way there, - Madame Defarge slightly waved her hand as a sign towards the scaffold, - where someone has already saved a spot and kept the knitting for me, I stopped by to visit the mistress.</t6714> <t6715>I want to meet Lucie.</t6715>
<t6716>− I know your wicked scheme now, - said Miss Pross, - don't think I won't resist.</t6716>
<t6717>One speaks French, the other speaks English; neither understands the other; both are cautious, and through each other's facial expressions and gestures, they try to guess the meaning of the words they do not understand.</t6717>
<t6718>− If Miss Lucie avoids me at this moment, it will be of no use, - said Madame Defarge.</t6718> <t6719>- True patriots will understand the meaning of such avoidance.</t6719> <t6720>Let me meet her.</t6720> <t6721>Tell her I want to meet.</t6721> <t6722>Do you hear me? −</t6722> <t6723>What's fair for you is fair for me, - replied Miss Pross. - You wicked foreign woman, I won't lose to you.</t6723>
<t6724>Mrs. Defarge could not fully understand that peculiar language, but she knew well enough that the other party would not listen.</t6724>
<t6725>− You stupid pig! - Madame Defarge frowned. - I don't need to hear you speak.</t6725> <t6726>I need to meet your master.</t6726> <t6727>Either tell him that I need to meet, or get out of the way so I can meet him! - The right arm angrily swung up to explain.</t6727>
<t6728>− Never in my life would I want to understand your nonsense language, - said Miss Pross.</t6728> <t6729>- But I would dare to give up everything, except the clothes on my back, to know if you have any suspicions.</t6729>
<t6730>No one took their eyes off each other for a minute.</t6730> <t6731>Madame Defarge was standing in the same position as when Miss Pross first saw her; but now she had taken a step forward.</t6731> <t6732>Miss Pross said: "I am an Englishwoman," Miss Pross said.</t6732> <t6733>"I can't take it anymore."</t6733>
<t6734>My life isn't worth a penny, losing it wouldn't matter at all.</t6734> <t6735>But as long as I keep you here, my dear mistress still has hope.</t6735> <t6736>If you lay a hand on me, I'll make sure you end up bald with not a hair left on your head! Miss Pross said while shaking her head, eyes glaring, and breathing heavily between her hurried words.</t6736> <t6737>Her voice was full of threats even though she had never hit anyone in her life.</t6737>
<t6738>That indomitable spirit moved Miss Pross to tears, which Madame Defarge mistakenly took as a sign of weakness.</t6738>
<t6739>− Ha ha, - Madame Defarge laughed loudly, - you coward! You useless thing!</t6739> <t6740>I will call the doctor. - Then she shouted loudly, - Citizen Doctor! Wife of Evrémonde! Child of Evrémonde! Anyone but that miserable fool, answer Citizeness Defarge!</t6740> <t6741>Perhaps because of the silence that followed, perhaps because of the expression on Miss Pross's face, or perhaps due to a suspicion unrelated to the other two, Madame Defarge suddenly thought that those people had left.</t6741> <t6742>She quickly opened the three room doors and looked inside.</t6742>
<t6743>− Every room is messy, showing signs of hurried packing, with all sorts of things scattered on the floor.</t6743> <t6744>So there's no one in the room behind you!</t6744> <t6745>Let me see.</t6745>
<t6746>− No! - Miss Pross understood the demand just as clearly as Madame Defarge understood the response.</t6746>
<t6747>− If they are not in that room, they have escaped, then we can chase and capture them, - Madame Defarge said to herself.</t6747>
<t6748>− As long as you don't know whether they are in that room or not, you still don't know what to do, - Miss Pross also said to herself.</t6748> <t6749>And you don't know that I won't let you know; whether you know or not, I will still prevent you from leaving here.</t6749>
<t6750>− Since I was little, I've been hustling on the streets, nothing could stop me.</t6750> <t6751>I'll tear you apart if you don't let me into that room.</t6751>
<t6752>− It's just you and me on this tall building with an empty courtyard, no one will hear anything.</t6752> <t6753>I hope I have enough strength to keep you here; every minute I keep you here is worth hundreds of thousands of guineas to my mistress.</t6753>
<t6754>Madame Defarge rushed to the door.</t6754> <t6755>Miss Pross immediately threw her arms around her opponent's waist and held on tightly.</t6755> <t6756>Madame Defarge's struggles, punches, and kicks were futile; Miss Pross, with the fierce determination of love, which is always stronger than hatred, held on tightly, even lifting her adversary off the ground during the struggle.</t6756> <t6757>Madame Defarge's hands slapped and scratched at Miss Pross's face, but she ducked her head and tightened her grip around the other's waist, refusing to let go, like a drowning person clinging desperately to their rescuer.</t6757>
<t6758>Immediately afterward, Madame Defarge's hands stopped beating and lowered to grope around her waist.</t6758> <t6759>Miss Pross said in a breathless voice: "It's under my arm, you can't pull it out."</t6759> <t6760>I'm stronger than you, thank God. I'll hold you tight until one or both of us faints or dies!</t6760> <t6761>Madame Defarge's hands moved to her chest.</t6761> <t6762>Miss Pross looked up, saw the object, swung her arm hard, a flash, a bang, and she was left standing alone - her eyes blurred by the gun smoke.</t6762>
<t6763>Everything happened in the blink of an eye.</t6763> <t6764>The terrifying silence as the smoke gradually dissipated, rising into the air like the soul of an enraged woman just departed from the motionless body lying on the floor.</t6764>
<t6765>At first, Miss Pross was terrified and stood far away from the corpse, then ran down the stairs calling for help in vain.</t6765> <t6766>Fortunately, she remembered the importance of this outcome, calmed herself in time, and ran back up.</t6766>
<t6767>Suppressing her fear, she went inside the house, even approaching the corpse to retrieve the bonnet and necessary clothing.</t6767> <t6768>She dressed quickly, rushed outside, closed all the doors tightly, locked them, and took the key with her.</t6768> <t6769>Afterwards, she sat on the stairs for a moment to breathe and cry, then stood up hurriedly and left.</t6769>
<t6770>Fortunately, her bonnet had a veil; otherwise, she would have had a hard time walking outside without being stopped and questioned.</t6770> <t6771>It was also fortunate that her appearance was naturally unusual, so her odd look didn't stand out as much as other women.</t6771> <t6772>She needed both of these advantages because her face bore clear scratch marks, her hair was disheveled, and her hastily donned outfit was extremely rumpled and untidy.</t6772>
<t6773>When crossing the bridge, she dropped the house keys into the river.</t6773> <t6774>Arriving at the church a few minutes before Cruncher and standing there waiting, she was lost in thought.</t6774>
<t6775>If the key got caught in some fishing net, if they identified whose house the key belonged to, if they opened the door and found a corpse, if she was stopped at the city gate, thrown into prison, and accused of murder!</t6775> <t6776>While she was lost in these anxious thoughts, the escort appeared, picked her up, and took her away.</t6776>
<t6777>− Is there any noise outside? - Miss Pross asked.</t6777>
<t6778>− Noisier than usual, - Cruncher replied; surprised by the question and her demeanor.</t6778>
<t6779>− I can't hear you, - said Miss Pross.</t6779> <t6780>- What did you say? Cruncher repeating it was useless; Miss Pross couldn't hear a thing.</t6780> <t6781>Cruncher thought in amazement, “Then I'll just nod, she will definitely see and understand.”</t6781> <t6782>And indeed, she did.</t6782>
<t6783>− Is it noisy outside right now? - Miss Pross asked immediately afterward.</t6783>
<t6784>Cruncher nodded again.</t6784>
<t6785>I can't hear.</t6785>
<t6786>− Only after an hour and already deaf? - Cruncher wondered, filled with worry.</t6786> <t6787>- What happened to her? −</t6787> <t6788>I felt like there was lightning and thunder, that explosion was the last sound I heard in this world.</t6788>
<t6789>− This woman looks really strange! - Cruncher grew increasingly anxious.</t6789> <t6790>- Did she do something to muster up courage?</t6790> <t6791>Listen!</t6791> <t6792>Those terrifying carriages are running on the road!</t6792> <t6793>Do you hear them, sister? −</t6793> <t6794>I can't hear anything, - Miss Pross said as she saw him mouthing words at her.</t6794> <t6795>- Oh, dear sir, at first there was a loud bang, then complete silence, absolute stillness, as if it would stay that way forever, as if it would remain silent for eternity.</t6795>
<t6796>− If she can't hear the sound of those dreadful carts approaching the execution ground, - Cruncher glanced over his shoulder at Miss Pross, - then I think she won't be able to hear anything else in this world anymore.</t6796>
<t6797>And indeed it is so.</t6797>
<t6798>15.</t6798> <t6799>The Last Echo</t6799>
<t6800>On the streets of Paris, the carts of the condemned rumbled loudly and harshly; vibrating.</t6800> <t6801>Six carts carried the daily ration of wine offered to Madame La Guillotine. All the greedy, hungry monsters from the depths of imagination combined into one entity: the guillotine.</t6801>
<t6802>However, in France, with its fertile land and climate, not a single blade of grass, leaf, root, bud, or ear of corn can grow under conditions as certain as those that have produced that terror.</t6802> <t6803>Keep crushing humanity once more, and it will immediately writhe and proliferate right under the hammer blow in the same deformed and distorted shape.</t6803> <t6804>Keep sowing the same seeds of tyrannical privilege and oppression, and it will surely yield corresponding fruits.</t6804>
<t6805>Six death carts rolled through the streets.</t6805> <t6806>Oh Time, powerful sorcerer, bring them back, they will become the royal carriages of supreme sovereignty, the horse-drawn carriages of the feudal aristocracy, the jewelry of the resplendent courtesans, the churches that are not houses of God but dens of thieves, the huts of millions of starving peasants!</t6806> <t6807>No; this great and majestic sorcerer, under the command of the Creator, will never reverse all changes.</t6807> <t6808>In the ancient wise tales of Arabia, the prophets told those transformed by magic, "If you have taken this form by the will of God, then remain so! But if you bear this shape only due to temporary enchantment, then return to your former self!".</t6808> <t6809>Unchanged and without hope, the death carts continued to roll.</t6809>
<t6810>The sorrowful wheels turn as if plowing winding furrows through the crowded streets.</t6810> <t6811>The furrows of faces are plowed aside as the wheels roll steadily down the road.</t6811> <t6812>The residents of the houses along the street have become so accustomed to this scene that many don't even bother to stand by the windows to watch, and some, even as their eyes glance over the faces of the condemned on the vehicles, continue their work without pause.</t6812> <t6813>In some places, residents with guests take the opportunity to watch the procession; the hosts proudly point out one prison wagon after another, like collectors of antiques or connoisseurs explaining who had sat on those fateful vehicles the day before or the day before that.</t6813>
<t6814>There were people on the vehicle who indifferently observed those scenes and everything on the final journey of their life; some looked at life and the people passing by with regretful eyes.</t6814> <t6815>Some sat with their heads down, immersed in despair; others were so concerned with their appearance that they cast heroic glances at the crowd, as often seen in plays or paintings.</t6815> <t6816>A few closed their eyes to think or tried to concentrate their thoughts.</t6816> <t6817>There was only one person, a miserable wretch, who seemed to have gone mad, so stunned and exhausted by terror that he burst into song and tried to dance on the vehicle.</t6817> <t6818>Not a single person, through gaze or gesture, showed any plea for mercy from the people along the road.</t6818>
<t6819>There was a motley group of cavalrymen riding alongside the convoy of condemned prisoners, and the faces of passersby often turned towards them, uttering a few questions.</t6819>
<t6820>It always seems to be a question because there is always a crowd jostling around the third carriage.</t6820> <t6821>The guards riding alongside that carriage always brandish their swords towards someone inside.</t6821> <t6822>Everyone is curious to know who the condemned person is; he stands at the back of the carriage, head bowed, talking to an ordinary girl sitting by the side of the carriage and holding his hand.</t6822> <t6823>He is neither curious nor concerned about the scene around him and only talks to that girl.</t6823> <t6824>Occasionally, along the long St. Honoré street, many shouts are heard cursing him.</t6824> <t6825>If those words affected him, he only gave a faint smile while shaking his head, causing his disheveled hair to fall a bit more around his face.</t6825> <t6826>He couldn't raise his hands to his face, as both arms were tied.</t6826>
<t6827>On the church steps, waiting for the convoy of condemned prisoners, stood a spy and a prison guard.</t6827> <t6828>The spy looked into the first carriage: nothing.</t6828> <t6829>He looked into the second carriage: nothing.</t6829> <t6830>He was thinking to himself, "Could he have betrayed me?" when his face lit up as he looked into the third carriage.</t6830>
<t6831>− Who is Evrémonde? - The man standing next to him asked.</t6831>
<t6832>- There. Standing at the back of the bus.</t6832>
<t6833>− The person holding the child's hand? −</t6833> <t6834>Yes.</t6834>
<t6835>− Down with Evrémonde! - The man shouted. - Send all the aristocrats to the guillotine!</t6835> <t6836>Down with Evrémonde! − Shh, shh! - The spy fearfully pleaded.</t6836>
<t6837>− Why are you shushing, Citizen? −</t6837> <t6838>He's about to pay for his crimes; in just over five minutes, his debt will be settled.</t6838> <t6839>Let him be.</t6839>
<t6840>But the other man continued to shout slogans, and for a moment Evrémonde turned to face him and saw the spy standing next to him.</t6840> <t6841>He stared intently, then the carriage passed by.</t6841>
<t6842>The clocks all struck three o'clock, the furrow plowed by the crowd parted, advanced to the place of execution, and stopped.</t6842> <t6843>The furrows of people plowed to the sides had now filled back in behind the last cart arriving, as everyone followed it to the place where the guillotine was set up.</t6843>
<t6844>Right in front of the guillotine, sitting on chairs as if watching public entertainment in a park, were many women busy knitting.</t6844> <t6845>Standing on a chair in the front row, looking around, was the Goddess of Vengeance searching for her friend.</t6845>
<t6846>− Thérèse! - The old woman shouted, her voice shrill.</t6846> <t6847>- Has anyone seen her? Thérèse Defarge! −</t6847> <t6848>She has never missed a time before, - a woman in the knitting crowd spoke up.</t6848>
<t6849>− No, not this time either, - the Goddess of Vengeance shouted impatiently.</t6849> <t6850>- Thérèse.</t6850>
<t6851>− Speak louder, - the woman suggested.</t6851>
<t6852>Correct! Louder, Goddess of Vengeance, shout louder, and she still can't hear.</t6852> <t6853>Shout louder, Goddess of Vengeance, add some curses, but she still doesn't appear.</t6853> <t6854>Order some other women to search for her up and down; but these female messengers, despite having done many terrible things, might not want to go far to find Madame Defarge! −</t6854> <t6855>Bad luck! - The Goddess of Vengeance shouted while stomping on the chair. - The death cart has arrived!</t6855> <t6856>Just a little longer and Evrémonde's life will be over, yet she isn't here! I still have Thérèse's knitting here.</t6856> <t6857>I'm so frustrated, disappointed to the point of tears! As the Goddess of Vengeance stepped down to sit and cry, the carts began to unload the condemned.</t6857> <t6858>The executioners were already dressed and ready.</t6858> <t6859>Thud! - A head was raised, the women who were knitting a moment ago didn't even glance up when the condemned were still breathing, now they all counted in unison: One! The second cart unloaded the condemned and drove away; the third cart arrived.</t6859>
<t6860>Thud! - And the group of women knitting did not stop their knitting for a minute, and counted: Two! The one considered to be Evrémonde got off the carriage and the seamstress was helped down next.</t6860> <t6861>He did not let go but still held the humble hand of the girl as he had promised.</t6861> <t6862>He gently turned her back to the machine that was ceaselessly thudding up and down nearby, and she looked at him gratefully.</t6862>
<t6863>− O stranger, without you, I could not be this calm, for I am humble and timid; without you, I could not think that the Lord who died for us today might still bring hope and peace.</t6863> <t6864>I believe that the Lord sent you to help me.</t6864>
<t6865>− Or perhaps she was sent to help me, - Sydney Carton said.</t6865> <t6866>- Just look straight at me, girl, don't worry about anything.</t6866>
<t6867>− I am not worried at all when I hold your hand.</t6867> <t6868>I will not be worried at all when I let go, if it happens quickly.</t6868>
<t6869>− It will be very quick.</t6869> <t6870>Don't be afraid! The two stood among the thinning crowd of victims, yet they conversed as if they were the only ones there.</t6870> <t6871>Eye to eye, word for word, hand in hand, heart to heart, two children of Mother Nature, two beings so distant and different from each other now meeting on the path to death, together returning to rest in the embrace of Mother.</t6871>
<t6872>− Brave and chivalrous friend, may I ask you one last question?</t6872> <t6873>I am ignorant and have a small query... just a minor thing.</t6873>
<t6874>− Go ahead and speak.</t6874>
<t6875>− I have a cousin, my only relative and also an orphan like me, whom I care for deeply.</t6875> <t6876>She is five years younger than me and is living on a farm in the south.</t6876> <t6877>Poverty has separated us, and she knows nothing about my fate... because I am illiterate and cannot write letters...</t6877>
<t6878>But if I knew how to write, how could I tell my story here!</t6878> <t6879>It's better that my younger sibling doesn't know.</t6879>
<t6880>− Yes, yes, that would be better.</t6880>
<t6881>− What I thought on the way here, and now still wonder when I look at the resolute face that has supported me, is...</t6881> <t6882>If this Republic truly brings good things to the poor, helping them be less hungry, less miserable in every way, my brother would surely have lived longer, perhaps even to old age...</t6882>
<t6883>− And then what, little sister? −</t6883> <t6884>Do you think that...</t6884> <t6885>- tears welling up in eyes resigned without a complaint, lips slightly trembling, - will I have to wait too long for my sister in Heaven, where I believe both you and I will be welcomed by God's grace? −</t6885> <t6886>Not long, little sister; there is no Time there, and no sorrow.</t6886>
<t6887>− You have greatly reassured me!</t6887> <t6888>I am so ignorant.</t6888> <t6889>Can I kiss you now?</t6889> <t6890>Is it almost time?</t6890> <t6891>Yes.</t6891>
<t6892>The girl kissed him on the lips; he kissed her lips; they solemnly blessed each other.</t6892> <t6893>The lonely hand no longer trembled when he let go; without a trace of impurity, that patient face was completely radiant, joyful.</t6893> <t6894>The girl went to the guillotine before him - and passed away; the knitting women counted: Twenty-Two.</t6894>
<t6895>“The Lord said: I am the resurrection and the life; whoever believes in me will live, even though they have died.</t6895> <t6896>And whoever lives by believing in me will never die.” Many voices murmured, many faces looked up, many footsteps crowded closer from the outer circle of the crowd, causing a wave of people to surge forward, then suddenly disappear.</t6896> <t6897>Twenty-Three.</t6897>
<t6898>Throughout the capital that night, people told each other that among all those who went to the guillotine in Paris, he had the most serene face.</t6898>
<t6899>Many people also say that he looks majestic and extraordinary, like a prophet.</t6899>
<t6900>Not long before, one of the most famous condemned criminals of that guillotine - a woman - had asked to record her final thoughts as she stood at the foot of the scaffold.</t6900> <t6901>If you were to utter what you are thinking, if you could see into the future, you would have said: "I see Barsad, and Cly, Defarge, the Goddess of Vengeance, the jurors, the Judge, so many new oppressors arising as the old oppressors are destroyed, all will perish under this punitive machine before it is discarded and no longer used.</t6901> <t6902>I see a magnificent city and a wise people rising from this abyss; in their true struggle for freedom, in their victories and defeats, after many long years, I see this country gradually atoning for the evils of the present time and for those that caused this turmoil."</t6902>
<t6903>I see those for whom I have sacrificed my life, living peacefully, usefully, prosperously, and happily, never to be seen again in England.</t6903> <t6904>I see her holding in her arms a child named after me.</t6904> <t6905>I see her father, old and frail, but recovered, devotedly treating the sick, and living comfortably.</t6905> <t6906>I see that kind old friend, close to this family for a long time, still wholeheartedly dedicated to them ten years from now, and peacefully receiving his reward in the hereafter.</t6906>
<t6907>I see myself being given a revered place in their hearts, in the hearts of their descendants, for many generations to come.</t6907> <t6908>I see her, an old woman, shedding tears in mourning for me on this day every year.</t6908> <t6909>I see her with her husband, at the end of their lives, lying together in a shared grave, and I know that I also hold a sacred and honorable place in their souls, no less cherished than the respect they have for each other.</t6909>
<t6910>I see the child in her arms bearing my name becoming a successful person on the career path that I left unfinished.</t6910> <t6911>I see that young man gaining widespread fame, causing my name to be honored and erasing the stains I had inadvertently brought upon that name.</t6911> <t6912>I see that young man becoming the most just judge, a revered person, who will bring the son also bearing my name, with the familiar forehead and golden hair, to this place - which by then will be magnificent, free from the blemishes of today - and I hear that person, moved and emotional, recounting my story to his son.</t6912>
<t6913>It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to, than I have ever known.</t6913><t6914>”</t6914>
<t6915>END</t6915>
