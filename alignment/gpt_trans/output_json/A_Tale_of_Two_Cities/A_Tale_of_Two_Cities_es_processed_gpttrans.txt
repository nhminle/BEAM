<t0>FIRST BOOK</t0>
<t1>RETURN TO LIFE</t1>
<t2>I.</t2>
<t3>THE PERIOD</t3>
<t4>It was the best of times and the most detestable of times; the age of wisdom and the age of foolishness, the epoch of belief and the epoch of incredulity, the era of Light and the era of Darkness, the spring of hope and the winter of despair.</t4> <t5>We had everything before us and we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven and we were all going direct the other way: in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.</t5>
<t6>A king with well-developed jaws and a queen with a flattened face sat on the throne of England, and a king with large jaws and a queen with a beautiful face occupied the throne of France.</t6> <t7>The lords of the great bread and fish stores of both countries saw as clear as crystal that the public good was secured forever.</t7>
<t8>It was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five.</t8> <t9>In such a favored period, spiritual revelations could not be lacking in England.</t9> <t10>Mrs. Southcott had recently celebrated her twenty-fifth birthday, whose sublime appearance in the world had been duly announced by a guardsman, a private prophet, predicting that preparations were being made to swallow up London and Westminster.</t10> <t11>Even the ghost of Cock Lane had been definitively buried, after wandering the world for twelve years, and revealing its messages to mortals in the same manner as the spirits of the previous year, showing a supernatural poverty of originality in their revelations.</t11> <t12>The only earthly messages received by the Crown and the English People came from a congress of British subjects residing in America, messages that, strangely enough, have proven to be of much greater significance to the human race than any received through the mediation of any of the chicks from Cock Lane.</t12>
<t13>Less favored was France in spiritual matters compared to her sister of the shield and trident, rolling charmingly and smoothly downhill, printing paper money and spending it with great delight.</t13> <t14>Under the direction of her most Christian shepherds, she also allowed herself to indulge in humanitarian distractions such as sentencing a young man or two to have their hands cut off, their tongues torn out with pincers, and to be burned alive, for the heinous crime of not having fallen to their knees in the muddy road on a rainy day to pay due homage to a procession of friars that passed within sight, though fifty or sixty yards away.</t14> <t15>It is very likely that, when that criminal was led to his execution, the woodcutter Destiny had already marked in the forests of France and Normandy the ancient trees that the saw would turn into planks to build that movable platform, equipped with its basket and blade, which has gained such terrible fame in history.</t15> <t16>It is also very possible that, in the rustic sheds attached to the huts of the farmers near Paris, on the same day, there were primitive carts, splattered with mud licked by pigs and serving as perches for poultry, which the reaper Death had selected to be the carriages of the Revolution.</t16> <t17>True it is that, although the Woodcutter and the Reaper worked incessantly, their labor was silent and no human ear could perceive their muffled steps, all the more so because harboring any suspicion that they were awake was as much as confessing oneself to the world as an atheist and a traitor.</t17>
<t18>In England, there was barely an atom of order and protection left to justify the national boast.</t18> <t19>The capital itself was every night the scene of armed robberies and the most daring and scandalous crimes.</t19> <t20>Publicly and officially, families were advised not to leave the city without first taking their furniture to the upholsterers' warehouses, the only places that offered them some guarantee.</t20> <t21>He who was a bandit under the cover of night appeared as an honorable merchant of the city in the light of day, and if ever recognized by the genuine merchant to whom he presented himself as a "captain," he would coolly fire a shot that sent him to a better world and then make a swift escape.</t21> <t22>The mail coach was attacked by seven bandits, of whom three were killed by the guard, who in turn were killed by the remaining four "due to running out of ammunition": subsequently, the coach was thoroughly and calmly robbed.</t22> <t23>The very high and mighty Lord Mayor of London was kidnapped and forced to live for some time in Turnham Green by a daring bandit, who had the honor of robbing such an illustrious figure right under the noses of his numerous escort and equally numerous servants.</t23> <t24>In the prisons of London, prisoners fought fierce battles with their jailers, whom the majesty of the law rewarded with musket shots.</t24> <t25>In the very halls of the court, skillful hands relieved the highest lords of the diamond crosses that adorned their necks.</t25> <t26>Musketeers entered St. Giles in search of contraband, and the mob fired upon the musketeers, and the musketeers fired upon the mob, without anyone thinking that such an event was anything but a common and trivial incident of life.</t26> <t27>Meanwhile, the executioner, always on duty, always busy, could not keep up with the various places where he was needed, today leaving large clusters of criminals hanging from his ropes and tomorrow hanging a common thief who broke into a neighbor's house on Thursday and embarked on the journey to eternity the following Saturday; to burn dozens of people in Newgate today, and hundreds of pamphlets at the door of Westminster Hall tomorrow; to send a ferocious scoundrel to eternity today, and do the same tomorrow with a miserable pickpocket who stole six pence from a farmer's son.</t27>
<t28>All these things, and a thousand others of the same kind that I could mention, were our daily bread in the blessed year of seventeen seventy-five without being an obstacle so that, while the Woodcutter and the Peasant Woman continued their silent labor, the two mortals with the developed jaws and the two with the flattened and beautiful faces, respectively, carried their divine rights at the tip of the spear.</t28> <t29>Thus did the year of seventeen seventy-five lead Their Excellencies and the millions of insignificant creatures, among them those who are to appear in the present chronicle, to their respective destinies, along the paths that were open before their steps.</t29>
<t30>II.</t30>
<t31>THE DILIGENCE</t31>
<t32>The one who was traveling first among the characters who are to play a very important role in the present story, on a Friday night in November, was the one from Dover.</t32> <t33>The traveler followed the stagecoach as it advanced heavily up the slope of Shooter's Hill.</t33> <t34>He was walking through the mud clinging to the dilapidated box of the carriage, and alongside him were the other travel companions, not certainly moved by the desire to exercise, which was rather unpleasant given the circumstances, but because the slope, harnesses, mud, stagecoach, and horses were so heavy that the latter had already declared three times their desire not to go any further, not to mention another time when they tried to turn around with the seditious intention of returning to Blackheath.</t34> <t35>The reins and the whip, the postilion and the guard, in agreement, had to read the article of the Campaign Regulations which ensures that never, under any circumstances, will brute animals be right, thanks to which the team capitulated and resigned themselves to fulfill their duty.</t35>
<t36>With their heads lowered and their tails trembling, they tried to make their way through the seas of thick mud that covered the path, stumbling here, taking a dreadful tumble there, falling not infrequently and always staggering.</t36> <t37>Whenever the coachman granted them some rest, the lead horse would violently shake its head and all the objects adorning it with a doctoral and emphatic air, as if its intention was to deny that the stagecoach could reach the top of the hill; and whenever he cracked the whip, the traveler I have been speaking of would lift his head in fright, like a man abruptly torn from his meditations.</t37>
<t38>Seas of watery vapor in the form of thick fog covered all the hollows and slid close to the ground like malevolent spirits seeking rest and finding none.</t38> <t39>The fog was sticky and very cold, advancing in graceful curls and undulating masses that chased and caught each other like waves do when the sea is rough.</t39> <t40>It was dense enough to confine within a very narrow circle the light shed by the carriage lanterns, to the point of preventing the visibility of the jets of steam the horses snorted out, which added to the abundance of those filling the atmosphere.</t40>
<t41>Two travelers, in addition to the one I have mentioned, were laboriously climbing the ramp following the stagecoach.</t41> <t42>All three had their coat collars pulled up to their ears, and all three wore very high boots.</t42> <t43>None of them could have said whether their travel companions were handsome or ugly, young or old; so carefully did they conceal their faces, and it wouldn't be amiss to add that, if it was impossible for the eyes of the body to discern the slightest physical feature, it was even more so for the eyes of the spirit to conjecture those of the soul, that is, the intentions that each of them might harbor.</t43> <t44>In those happy times, travelers were highly reserved and avoided with great caution placing trust in unknown persons, for any stagecoach or road companion could turn out to be a bandit or an accomplice of bandits, gentlemen who abounded to a blessing, as all taverns and inns had no shortage of soldiers in the pay of the "captain," whose ranks were nourished by everyone without exception, starting with the innkeeper and ending with the last stable boy.</t44> <t45>This was precisely what the guard of the Dover mail coach was thinking about on that Friday night in November of seventeen seventy-five, as it laboriously climbed the Shooter's Hill, seated on the rear bench of the cart reserved for him, furiously stomping on the boards to prevent his feet from turning into blocks of ice, and with his hand on a loaded blunderbuss, which topped a pile of six or eight saddle pistols, also loaded, which were based on another pile of perfectly sharpened machetes and daggers.</t45>
<t46>On the journey to which the present story refers, what invariably happened on all trips occurred in the Dover stagecoach: the guard suspected the travelers, the travelers suspected each other and the guard, they all looked at each other with distrust, and as for the postilion, he was only sure of the horses: that is, with full awareness, he would have sworn by the Old and New Testament that the livestock was not fit for the task it was destined for.</t46>
<t47>—Giddy up! Giddy up!—shouted the postilion.</t47><t48>—Get up, lazy ones!</t48> <t49>Just one more pull, and you'll be at the top of that cursed hill! Hey, Pepe!</t49>
<t50>—What's up?—replied the guard.</t50>
<t51>—What time do you think it is?</t51>
<t52>—At least, eleven ten.</t52>
<t53>—Wrath of God!—shouted the postilion.</t53><t54>—It's ten past eleven and we're not at the crest of Shooter! Ap... ap...! Ah, thief!</t54>
<t55>The lead horse, whose back received the terrible lash with which the postilion accompanied his last words, advanced decisively up the ramp, dragging its three companions.</t55> <t56>The coach continued to jolt, escorted by the three travelers who took great care not to separate from it, stopping when the coach did and moving at its pace, always careful not to get ahead or fall behind, knowing that if they had done so, they would have run the imminent risk of receiving a musket shot like bandits.</t56>
<t57>The heavy wagon finally conquered the slope: the exhausted horses stopped again to catch their breath, and the guard jumped onto the road to apply the brakes to the wheels and open the door so that the travelers could get in.</t57>
<t58>—Pepe!—murmured the postilion, lowering his head and voice.</t58>
<t59>—What's up, Tomás?—replied the guard.</t59>
<t60>—It seems to me that a horse is trotting towards us, Pepe.</t60>
<t61>—It seems to me that he is coming at a gallop, Tomás—replied the guard, letting go of the door and jumping up to his place.</t61><t62>—Gentlemen, for the King and Justice!</t62>
<t63>Having made the call, he grabbed his arquebus and remained on the defensive.</t63>
<t64>The traveler to whom this story refers was on the step, ready to enter the coach, and the other two remained on the road ready to follow him.</t64> <t65>The first one stayed on the step, and as a consequence, his two travel companions had to stay on the road.</t65> <t66>The three of them cast their eyes from the postilion to the guard and from the guard to the postilion, and listened.</t66> <t67>The postilion had turned his head back, the guard did the same, and even the lead horse pricked up its ears and looked back, so as not to be a discordant note.</t67>
<t68>The silence following the cessation of the vehicle's rolling, added to the silence of the night, made a solemn silence reign at the top of the hill.</t68> <t69>The panting of the horses imparted a trembling movement to the carriage, giving it the appearance of a monster overcome by intense agitation.</t69> <t70>The travelers' hearts were beating so strongly that it probably wouldn't have been impossible to hear their heartbeats, but if not that, at least the solemn stillness of the scene evidenced that its characters were holding their breath, or lacked it to breathe, and that their pulses were rapid due to the anticipation.</t70>
<t71>The hooves of the horse, galloping furiously, echoed in the silence of the night as it ascended the ramp.</t71>
<t72>—Hey! Stop, whoever you are!—roared the guard with a thunderous voice.</t72><t73>—Stop, or I'll shoot!</t73>
<t74>The frenzied galloping ceased and a man's voice cut through the air, asking:</t74>
<t75>—Is that the Dover coach?</t75>
<t76>—We will see about that later!—replied the guard.</t76><t77>—Who are you?</t77>
<t78>—Is it the Dover mail coach?—the voice insisted.</t78>
<t79>—Why do you want to know?</t79>
<t80>—Because if it is, I need to speak with one of its passengers.</t80>
<t81>—Which passenger?</t81>
<t82>—Mr. Mauricio Lorry.</t82>
<t83>Immediately, the traveler we have been talking about stated that he was Maurice Lorry.</t83> <t84>The guard, the postilion, and his two travel companions gave him distrustful looks.</t84>
<t85>—Be careful not to move!—the guard commanded.</t85><t86>—Keep in mind that if I make a mistake, which happens to me sometimes, there will be no one in the world capable of fixing it.</t86> <t87>Gentleman named Lorry, answer my questions truthfully!</t87>
<t88>—What's happening?—asked the person addressed, with a slightly trembling voice.</t88><t89>—Who is looking for me?</t89> <t90>Jeremiah, perhaps?</t90>
<t91>—If that individual is Jeremiah, damn if I like Jeremiah's voice—grumbled the guard through his teeth.</t91><t92>—I don't like such rough voices.</t92>
<t93>—The same, Mr. Lorry—replied the one on the horse.</t93>
<t94>—What's happening?</t94>
<t95>—Dispatch from there for you: T. and Company.</t95>
<t96>—I know the messenger, guard—said Lorry, jumping from the step to the road, helped, and not gently, by his two travel companions, who pulled on the cape of his coat, immediately mounted, closed the door, and raised the window.</t96><t97>—He can come closer: I vouch for him.</t97>
<t98>—And who vouches for you?—the guard asked himself quietly.</t98><t99>—Let's see!—he continued in a thunderous voice.</t99><t100>—Listen, you on the horse!</t100>
<t101>—Finish quickly!—replied Jeremiah, with a voice rougher than before.</t101>
<t102>—Advance at a walk...! Do you understand me?</t102> <t103>And if you have holsters on your saddle, make sure to keep your hands far away from them.</t103> <t104>Keep in mind that I am only good at making mistakes, and when I do, they always take the form of lead.</t104> <t105>Come closer so we can see each other's faces.</t105>
<t106>The shape of a horse with its rider soon emerged from the fog, slowly approaching the passenger who was waiting by the step.</t106> <t107>The rider stopped his mount, looked at the guard, and handed the passenger a folded paper.</t107> <t108>The rider was panting as he breathed, and both he and his horse were covered in mud, from the hooves of the latter to the hat of the former.</t108>
<t109>—Watch out!—called the passenger in a confidential tone.</t109>
<t110>—What do you want?—replied the fearsome guard dryly, his right hand on the arquebus's stock, his left on the barrel, and his eyes on the rider.</t110>
<t111>—You can be completely at ease—replied Lorry.</t111><t112>—I belong to Tellson's Bank, a London institution that you surely know.</t112> <t113>Matters of importance bring me to Paris.</t113> <t114>Take a crown to have a drink... May I read this?</t114>
<t115>—If you read it, take care of it as soon as possible, sir.</t115>
<t116>Lorry unfolded the paper, and read, first to himself and then aloud:</t116>
<t117>"Expect Miss's visit in Dover."</t117>
<t118>—You see that the message is not long, keep it—added Lorry.</t118><t119>—Reply to the sender, Jeremiah, with the following word: "Resurrected."</t119>
<t120>Jeremiah jumped onto the saddle.</t120>
<t121>—What a devilishly strange response!—he exclaimed, using the gruffest tone of voice.</t121>
<t122>—Repeat that word, and those who sent you will know that you have fulfilled the mission they entrusted to you.</t122> <t123>You may begin your return...</t123> <t124>Good night.</t124>
<t125>Saying these words, the passenger opened the door and entered the carriage, without any of his travel companions offering him a hand out of courtesy. They had hidden their pockets and watches in their boots during the mentioned incident and pretended to sleep deeply, undoubtedly to avoid situations that would require more active engagement than sleep.</t125>
<t126>The carriage creaked again and groaned more plaintively than ever as it began the descent of the hill.</t126> <t127>The guard placed his arquebus on the pile of pistols, but first ensuring that those supplementary ones hanging from his belt were in place, took out from under the seat a small box containing some locksmith tools, two candles, a striker, flint, and tinder.</t127> <t128>A foresighted man, he carried everything necessary to light the carriage lamps with relative ease and safety (if he was lucky) in about five minutes, should they go out or be extinguished, as happened more than once during the journeys.</t128>
<t129>—Tomás—called the guard in a low voice.</t129>
<t130>—What do you want, Pepe?</t130>
<t131>—Did you hear the reading of the paper?</t131>
<t132>—I heard it.</t132>
<t133>—And the response?</t133>
<t134>—Also.</t134>
<t135>—And what do you get out of it, Tomás?</t135>
<t136>—Absolutely nothing, Pepe.</t136>
<t137>—What a coincidence!—exclaimed the guard.</t137><t138>—The same thing happens to me.</t138>
<t139>Jeremiah, once he was alone with the fog that surrounded him, dismounted, not only to give some rest to his exhausted steed, but also to clean the splashes of mud that covered his face and to lower the brim of his hat, which held about half a gallon of water.</t139> <t140>Then he stood in the middle of the road, and when he stopped hearing the noise of the coach's wheels, he turned around and began to walk back, saying to the mare he was riding:</t140>
<t141>—After the gallop you've had from the Temple, my friend, I don't trust your hands much until we get to flat ground... "Resurrected...!" An answer that hell might understand, but not Jeremiah...!</t141> <t142>What I can assure you, Jeremiah, is that if resurrection became fashionable, you would find yourself in the greatest trouble you've ever seen in your devilish life!</t142>
<t143>III.</t143>
<t144>THE SHADOWS OF THE NIGHT</t144>
<t145>Worthy of careful reflection is the phenomenon that all human beings carry within their constitution the need to be impenetrable secrets to one another.</t145> <t146>Whenever I enter a large city at night, mechanically and without realizing it, I begin to think that each and every house that forms the immense and tightly packed cluster before my eyes contains its own peculiar secret, that each and every room in the houses contains its own peculiar secret, and that each and every heart that beats in the hundreds of thousands of chests that inhabit them is a profound secret to the heart enclosed in the nearest chest.</t146> <t147>The phenomenon has something terrifying, something in common with death.</t147> <t148>The heart of the person dear to me seems like a book whose pages I am turning and whose end I will never reach: it seems like an immense liquid mass in whose unfathomable depths I have glimpsed, by the light that momentarily penetrated them, hidden treasures and a thousand secrets that have excited my desire to know; but an immutable will has decreed that I can only read the first page of the book, that the liquid mass will solidify and turn into an eternally frozen mass, while the light played on its surface and I watched it from the shore, ignorant of what it contained in its depths.</t148> <t149>My friend has died, my neighbor has died, my loves have died, and with them died the yearnings of my soul, because their death brought with it the inexorable consolidation, the perpetuation of the secret that those individualities contained, just as death will forever seal mine, burying it with me in the grave.</t149> <t150>Does there sleep, perhaps, in any of the cemeteries of the cities I visit, a dead person whose intimate personality is more inscrutable to me than those of the living who busily and solicitously walk their streets, more than mine is to all of them?</t150>
<t151>As far as this particular matter is concerned, the natural inheritance, an inalienable inheritance, of the messenger rider was the same as that of the king, the same as that of the prime minister, the same as that of the wealthiest merchant in London.</t151> <t152>The same thing happened with the three travelers confined within the narrow limits of an old and rickety coach.</t152> <t153>Each one of them was an impenetrable mystery to their companion, as impenetrable as if they had traveled in their own coach, alone and with a nation between each coach.</t153>
<t154>The messenger mounted his horse and began the return journey at a slow trot, stopping at all the taverns and inns along the way to refresh his throat, but without engaging in conversation with anyone and always trying to keep his hat pulled down over his eyes.</t154> <t155>This precaution harmonized perfectly with his eyes, which were black and very close together; so close, in fact, that it seemed they feared someone might jump over them one by one if they were found separated.</t155> <t156>They had a sinister expression, perhaps contributed to by the fact that they shone between a hat that looked more like a triangular spittoon than a hat, and a sort of cloak that started from the eyes and ended at the knees of its wearer.</t156> <t157>When he stopped to drink, he would use his left hand to lift the cloak just enough to pour the liquid into his mouth with his right hand, and as soon as he finished drinking, he would pull it back up again.</t157>
<t158>—No, Jeremiah, no!—murmured the messenger, always harping on the same theme.</t158><t159>—Jeremiah cannot agree with that...</t159> <t160>You are an honest man, Jeremiah, a merchant who cannot approve of that kind of business... Resurrected!...</t160> <t161>Hang me if Mr. Lorry wasn't drunk when he gave me such a message!</t161>
<t162>So perplexed was he by the strange word that he frequently took off his hat to scratch his head mercilessly; and since I am talking about his head, I will say that, except for the crown, which was completely bald, it disappeared under a mass of coarse hair that descended down his back to his shoulders and grew in front up to the start of his broad and blunt nose.</t162> <t163>His head resembled the work of a blacksmith, a wall ridge bristling with thick spikes, which fans of the game "at one, the mule" would have looked at with respectful terror, surely considering it the most dangerous jump a man could make in the world.</t163>
<t164>The shadows of the night have truly strange whims.</t164> <t165>To the messenger, while he was returning with the mysterious message that he had to deliver to the night watchman of Tellson's Bank, so that he could in turn pass it on to his superiors, they were resurrected dead, ghosts risen from the graves, while to the mare he was riding, they were horses running without rest.</t165> <t166>For the three inscrutable travelers occupying the inside of the coach, while it jumped and bumped over the road's potholes, the shadows of the night took the forms of the thoughts that their respective imaginations conjured.</t166>
<t167>It could be said that the Tellson Bank had moved to the stagecoach.</t167> <t168>For the bank employee, holding on with one hand to a strap, which allowed him to avoid colliding with his neighbor every time the vehicle jolted—and it jolted with exasperating frequency—the narrow windows of the coach, the lantern of the same, which filtered faint glimmers through them, and the dark bulk of the traveler he had before his half-closed eyes, were the Bank, in which he was conducting countless operations, each more successful than the last.</t168> <t169>The noise made by the harnesses seemed to him like the jingling of coins with which he paid bills, securities, and checks at a dizzying speed.</t169> <t170>It wasn't long before his imagination transported him to the underground vaults, whose secrets he knew so well, and armed with his large keys, he opened the enormous safe, which he found as intact, as full, as solid as he had left it the last time he had the chance to see it.</t170>
<t171>But dominating the image of the Bank, which always accompanied him, and that of the stagecoach, which never left him, he felt another fixed, tenacious, and persistent idea that occupied him throughout the night.</t171> <t172>His journey had the purpose of bringing someone out of the grave.</t172>
<t173>Now then; what the shadows of the night did not determine was which among the infinite number of faces that passed in an endless procession before his eyes was that of the buried person.</t173> <t174>They were, however, all faces of a man of approximately forty-five years, and they differed mainly in the passions that each of them reflected and in the livid paleness that characterized them.</t174> <t175>Before the half-closed eyes of the traveler paraded one after another faces that were mirrors of pride, contempt, defiance, obstinacy, submission, pain, faces with sunken cheeks, cadaverous color, thin and emaciated, but the general lines of all of them were the same, just as they all appeared framed in prematurely white hair.</t175> <t176>Dozens, hundreds of times the drowsy traveler asked the specter:</t176>
<t177>—When did they bury you?</t177>
<t178>—Almost eighteen years ago—replied the ghost invariably.</t178>
<t179>—Had you lost all hope of seeing the light of day again?</t179>
<t180>—It's been a long time.</t180>
<t181>—Do you know that you are going to resurrect?</t181>
<t182>—That's what they tell me.</t182>
<t183>—I suppose you are interested in living?</t183>
<t184>—I can't say it.</t184>
<t185>—Would you like me to introduce her to you?</t185> <t186>Will you come with me to see her?</t186>
<t187>The answers that the different specters gave to this last question varied greatly and even contradicted each other.</t187>
<t188>—Wait!—some exclaimed with a choked voice.</t188><t189>—I would die if I saw her so suddenly!</t189>
<t190>—Take me right away!—others responded, shedding seas of tears.</t190><t191>—I'm dying to see her!</t191>
<t192>—I don't know her!—responded other specters, looking astonished at the one who asked them.</t192><t193>—I don't know what you're talking about!</t193> <t194>I don't understand.</t194>
<t195>The traveler interrupted these imaginary discourses to dig, dig without respite or rest, sometimes with a hoe, sometimes with a shovel, at times with an immense key, and at others with his own nails, in his eagerness to unearth the one who had been prematurely buried.</t195> <t196>Exhausted at last, lacking strength, he would fall face down on the disturbed earth, and at the touch of it on his forehead, he would wake up startled and lower the windowpane so that the slashes of fog and rain would bring him from the dream world to reality.</t196>
<t197>However, he did not achieve his goal.</t197> <t198>Flanking the road, fleeing before the uncertain glow of the carriage lanterns, he saw the same images brought to life by his excited imagination.</t198> <t199>Before his eyes rose the Tellson Bank, his hands paid bills and checks, he walked through the underground chambers, visited the vault, and suddenly the ghosts with livid faces and white hair appeared before him, and the previous interrogation repeated itself:</t199>
<t200>—When did they bury you?</t200>
<t201>—It was almost eighteen years ago.</t201>
<t202>—I suppose you would be interested in living?</t202>
<t203>—I can't say it.</t203>
<t204>And back to digging, and digging, and digging, until one of his travel companions indicated to him, somewhat brusquely, to raise the window glass.</t204>
<t205>He then tried to focus his thoughts on his two travel companions; but it didn't take long for him to forget them and return to being absorbed in thoughts of the Bank and the grave.</t205>
<t206>—When did they bury you?</t206>
<t207>—It was almost eighteen years ago.</t207>
<t208>—Had you lost hope that they would unearth you?</t208>
<t209>—A very long time ago.</t209>
<t210>The words still rang in his ears, as clear and distinct as he had ever heard in his life, when he suddenly realized that the shadows of the night had fled in shame before the splendors of the new day.</t210>
<t211>He rolled down the window and gazed at the bright disk of the sun.</t211> <t212>Embedded in the furrow of a field next to the road, he saw a plow.</t212> <t213>Beyond that, a grove full of trees could be seen, in whose branches many leaves remained, to which the king star gave red and golden tones.</t213> <t214>The ground was damp, the sky clear, and the sun rose solemn, placid, sparkling, beautiful.</t214>
<t215>—Eighteen years!—exclaimed the traveler, his eyes fixed on the sun.</t215><t216>—My God... My God! Buried alive for eighteen years!</t216>
<t217>IV.</t217>
<t218>THE PREPARATION</t218>
<t219>When the stagecoach arrived in Dover, on time and without mishap, the chief steward of the King George Hotel hurried to open the door, as was his custom.</t219> <t220>He managed to give his action a certain solemn and ceremonious air, and indeed it was deserved, for truly worthy of all congratulations and well-wishes was the fortunate traveler who, in the middle of winter, undertook and successfully completed such a perilous feat as a stagecoach journey from London to Dover.</t220>
<t221>The refined and accomplished butler could only congratulate a single traveler, simply because only one was in the carriage: the others had stayed at their respective destinations.</t221> <t222>The interior of the coach, dirty, full of straw and foul-smelling, looked more like a dark kennel than anything else, and Mr. Lorry, who occupied it, when he got out, shaking off the straw and filth that covered his clothing, wrapped in an old and dirty coat, wearing a battered hat and high boots covered in mud, looked more like a giant breed dog than a man.</t222>
<t223>—Will a ship leave for Calais tomorrow, steward?—he asked.</t223>
<t224>—It will sail, sir, if the good weather continues and a favorable wind blows.</t224> <t225>Does the gentleman desire a bed?</t225>
<t226>—I don't plan to go to bed until night; but I need a room and a barber.</t226>
<t227>—And lunch afterwards, sir?</t227> <t228>Very well...</t228> <t229>This way, sir.</t229> <t230>The Concordia for this gentleman...!</t230> <t231>The luggage of this gentleman to the Concordia...! Hot water to the Concordia!...</t231> <t232>Let a barber go up to the Concordia immediately!...</t232> <t233>In the Concordia, you will find, sir, a pleasant fire.</t233>
<t234>The room known by the name of Concordia, which was invariably assigned to one of the travelers arriving by coach, offered a special interest.</t234> <t235>No one ever noticed the slightest difference between the various characters who entered it, for no human eye ever distinguished anything other than a travel coat, worn over usually dirty shoes, and topped by a hat almost always old and battered; but if it always seemed to be the same individual entering Concordia, over the years men of all ages, types, figures, and appearances emerged from it.</t235> <t236>It is not, therefore, surprising that chance led to the path between Concordia and the dining room being occupied by two butlers, three waiters, and several maids, not to mention the owner of the establishment herself, all of whom were engaged in various domestic tasks, when from the mentioned room emerged a gentleman of about sixty years, dressed in a dark-colored suit, almost new and very well preserved, and sporting very large square cuffs, although not larger nor squarer than the wallets that adorned his pockets.</t236>
<t237>The gentleman in the dark suit headed to the dining room, and he was the only one who sat at the table that morning.</t237> <t238>They had placed it next to the fireplace, and by the warmth of the fire, our traveler sat, with one hand on each knee, waiting to be served breakfast, in such a rigid and composed manner that it seemed as if he had taken a seat to have his portrait painted.</t238>
<t239>He seemed like a methodical and orderly man.</t239> <t240>From the depths of his vest pocket, a watch of extraordinarily large size let its powerful and sonorous voice be heard, whose undeniable gravity and longevity resembled a noisy and eloquent protest against the lightness and futility of the fire burning in the fireplace.</t240> <t241>The gentleman had good calves, and it is possible that he was proud of them, judging by the stockings that encased them, of the same tone as his suit, made of very fine material and perfectly fitted.</t241> <t242>His shoes, which adorned beautiful buckles, although of common class, revealed the hand of a skilled and experienced shoemaker.</t242>
<t243>Perfectly fitted to his head, he wore a small, very fine, and slightly curly wig, which, one might suppose, was made of hair, although to tell the truth, it more closely resembled filaments of silk or glass.</t243> <t244>As for his shirt, if in fineness it could not compete with his stockings, in whiteness it rivaled the crests of the waves that gently came to kiss the sand of the nearby beach, or the sails that shone offshore in the rays of the sun.</t244> <t245>Adding animation to that face of tranquil expression, or rather, that expressionless face, for the persistent hand of habit had erased any expression from it, were two penetrating eyes, though a little soft, which in past years must have given their owner quite some trouble before he managed to tame them and give them that impenetrable reserve and composure that was characteristic of all the employees of Tellson's Bank.</t245> <t246>On the face, healthy in color though furrowed with numerous wrinkles, the anxieties and worries had left no traces, perhaps because the old bachelors employed at Tellson's Bank never concerned themselves with anything other than the affairs of other people, and those affairs are like used gloves, which go in and out without effort.</t246>
<t247>Mr. Lorry eventually fell asleep.</t247> <t248>He woke up when lunch was served and said to the waiter who was serving him:</t248>
<t249>—I want a room prepared for a young lady who will probably arrive today, though I don't know at what time.</t249> <t250>She might ask for Mr. Maurice Lorry, although it could also happen that she asks for the gentleman from Tellson's Bank: in either case, notify me.</t250>
<t251>—It's very well, sir.</t251> <t252>The Tellson Bank of London, sir?</t252>
<t253>—Yes.</t253>
<t254>—We have often had the honor of serving the gentlemen of that Bank, sir, on their repeated journeys between London and Paris, and vice versa.</t254> <t255>Ah! Tellson's Bank and Company travels a lot, sir!</t255>
<t256>—True.</t256> <t257>Our house is as French as it is English.</t257>
<t258>—But if I'm not mistaken, you don't usually travel much, sir.</t258>
<t259>—Very little in recent years.</t259> <t260>It must have been... fifteen years since I last went to France.</t260>
<t261>—I wasn't here on that date, sir...</t261> <t262>Neither I nor any of us who are here today.</t262> <t263>The Hotel del Rey Jorge had different owners, sir.</t263>
<t264>—I believe so.</t264>
<t265>—On the other hand, I would bet without fear of losing, that a house like Tellson's Bank and Company has been prospering and flourishing, not just for fifteen years, but for fifty.</t265>
<t266>—You can bet and say one hundred and fifty, without fear of losing and with the knowledge that you are very close to the truth.</t266>
<t267>—One hundred fifty years!</t267>
<t268>Opening his eyes wide and forming his mouth into a perfect O, the waiter adopted the classic posture, passed the napkin from his right arm to his left, and remained silent, watching the traveler eat and drink, as waiters have been doing since time immemorial in all centuries and countries.</t268>
<t269>After lunch, Mr. Lorry went out for a little walk along the beach.</t269> <t270>The small and irregular town of Dover was not visible from there, except for its rooftops which, nestled among the peaks of limestone quarries, resembled a gigantic marine oyster.</t270> <t271>The beach was a desert bristling with rocks and plagued with reefs, where the sea did whatever it pleased, and what it invariably pleased to do was destroy.</t271> <t272>Almost continuously, it roared against the town, bellowed against the cliffs, charged against the rocks that tried to block its path and knocked them down with a crash.</t272> <t273>In the houses, there was such a strong smell of fish that it seemed as if the inhabitants of the waters came out to cure their illnesses in the houses, just as sick people often seek health in sea baths.</t273> <t274>A few, very few, engaged in fishing in those waters, and if during the day the beach was always deserted, at night, on the other hand, people could be seen staring anxiously into the vastness of the sea.</t274> <t275>Insignificant merchants who were never seen doing business suddenly amassed immense fortunes that had no rational explanation, and it was very noticeable that no one in those places could tolerate the presence of a light, from which they fled as if from the devil.</t275>
<t276>As the afternoon declined, and the air, so diaphanous and transparent during the day that there were moments when the coasts of France could be perfectly seen, became saturated with vapors and mists, Mr. Lorry's thoughts also darkened.</t276> <t277>When, as night fell, he sat by the warmth of the dining room fire to wait for his meal to be served, just as he had waited that morning for his breakfast, his imagination dug, dug without rest.</t277>
<t278>A bottle of aged claret does not harm the health of a good digger, although it may hinder his activity, if it is true, as they say, that claret, especially if it is good and aged, inoculates in the drinker a marked tendency to suspend all kinds of physical work.</t278> <t279>Mr. Lorry had long since suspended all his operations and had just poured the last liquid remaining in the bottle into his glass, his face revealing all the satisfaction that an elderly gentleman can show upon seeing the bottom of a bottle, when his ears were struck by the rapid rolling of a carriage entering the narrow alley and stopping within the hotel courtyard.</t279>
<t280>—The young lady!—exclaimed Lorry, setting down the glass he was about to raise to his lips.</t280>
<t281>Moments later, the waiter entered the dining room and announced that Miss Manette, newly arrived from London, wished to see the gentleman from Tellson's Bank.</t281>
<t282>—So soon?</t282>
<t283>—Miss Manette has had some refreshment on the way, and the only thing she now truly longs for is to see the gentleman from Tellson's Bank without any delay, provided he is willing to visit her.</t283>
<t284>The only recourse left for the gentleman from Tellson's Bank was to empty the glass with a gesture of stolid desperation, adjust his silky wig over his ears, and follow the waiter, who guided him to Miss Manette's room.</t284> <t285>It was a large room, very dark, draped in black like a funeral chapel, and furnished with dark-toned objects, among which could be counted a number of tables, all heavy and all black.</t285> <t286>On the one in the center, smeared, like all the others, a thousand times with oil, there were two candlesticks, also black, whose light was not enough to dispel the darkness that reigned supreme in the room.</t286>
<t287>The darkness was so dense that Mr. Lorry, while advancing on a carpet, quite worn out by the way, assumed that the young lady would be in some adjoining room, and he persisted in this belief until, after leaving the two candelabras behind him, he stumbled upon a person who was waiting for him, standing between the table and the fireplace.</t287> <t288>It was a young woman of about seventeen years of age, dressed in a riding habit, whose hands still held by the ribbon the straw hat she had worn during the journey.</t288> <t289>As he fixed his eyes on that tiny, perfectly oval face with graceful lines, framed by an abundant mass of golden hair, two blue eyes met his, looking at him with a penetrating gaze and an expression that was neither of perplexity, nor of astonishment, nor of admiration, nor of alarm, although it probably partook of all four.</t289> <t290>In Mr. Lorry's imagination, as he appreciated the features before him, the figure of a little girl he had carried in his arms many years before on a crossing journey through that same channel with cold weather and extraordinarily rough sea emerged.</t290> <t291>The image dissipated almost as quickly as the stain produced by breath on the not very clean cornucopia placed behind the young woman, and enclosed in a frame that offered a procession of headless black cupids, many of them limping or maimed, who offered black baskets full of Dead Sea fruits to some black female idols, and he bowed deeply and solemnly before Miss Manette.</t291>
<t292>—Please have a seat, sir—said a clear and musical voice, with a foreign accent, though barely noticeable.</t292>
<t293>—I kiss your hand, miss—replied Mr. Lorry, making another bow in the old-fashioned manner, before taking a seat.</t293>
<t294>—Yesterday I received a letter from the Bank, sir, in which they told me that it had been found out... or discovered...</t294>
<t295>—The word is the least important thing, miss: both express the idea.</t295>
<t296>—...</t296> <t297>Something about the few possessions my poor father left behind, whom I had the misfortune of never knowing...</t297>
<t298>Lorry squirmed in the chair, casting anguished glances at the mournful procession of black cupids, as if hoping to find in the absurd little baskets they carried the light that his intelligence denied him.</t298>
<t299>—...</t299> <t300>And that, consequently, it was absolutely necessary for me to make a trip to Paris, where I would have to get in touch with a gentleman from the Bank, sent to the capital of France for that purpose.</t300>
<t301>—That gentleman is me, miss.</t301>
<t302>—I supposed so, sir.</t302>
<t303>The girl made a graceful curtsy (in those times, young ladies made curtsies).</t303> <t304>The gentleman bowed deeply.</t304>
<t305>I replied to the Bank that if the people who extend their benevolence towards me to the point of advising me considered the trip necessary, I would certainly go to France, but that, given that I am an orphan and have no friends who can accompany me, I would appreciate it as a special favor if they allowed me to place myself, during the journey, under the protection of the worthy gentleman with whom I was to make contact in Paris.</t305> <t306>The gentleman had already left London, but I believe they sent a messenger asking him to wait for me here.</t306>
<t307>—I considered myself happy to receive the assignment, and I will consider myself much happier fulfilling it, miss—replied Mr. Lorry.</t307>
<t308>—Thank you very much, sir; believe me, I give them to you from the heart.</t308> <t309>The Bank informed me that the gentleman would explain the details of the matter to me, and that I should be prepared to receive surprising news.</t309> <t310>I have done everything possible to prepare myself, and you can be sure that I have a genuine desire to know what it is about.</t310>
<t311>—I find it very natural—replied Lorry.</t311><t312>—Yes... perfectly natural... I...</t312>
<t313>He paused, adjusted his toupee back over his ears, and finally replied:</t313>
<t314>—The truth is that it is so difficult to begin...</t314>
<t315>And he did not begin.</t315> <t316>In his indecision, his eyes met those of his interlocutor.</t316> <t317>On her forehead, a few wrinkles appeared, her expression changed, and her hand rose to the level of her eyes, as if she wanted to grasp some shadow that had just crossed before them.</t317>
<t318>—Have we ever met before, sir?—he asked.</t318>
<t319>—Do you believe so?—asked Lorry, extending his arms and smiling.</t319>
<t320>The delicate and fine line that had formed between the girl's eyebrows became deeper and more energetic as she sat down in the chair beside which she had been standing until then.</t320> <t321>Lorry watched her silently, and when after a while the young woman raised her eyes again, he hastened to ask:</t321>
<t322>—I suppose that in your adopted homeland you would like to be treated and spoken to as an English lady; isn't that right, Miss Manette?</t322>
<t323>—As you wish, sir.</t323>
<t324>—I am a businessman, Miss Manette, and I have been tasked with handling and successfully completing a business matter.</t324> <t325>When you hear all the details related to it from my lips, do not see in me anything more than a talking machine, for in truth, a talking machine I am.</t325> <t326>With your permission, Miss Manette, I will tell you the story of one of our clients.</t326>
<t327>—History!</t327>
<t328>It seems that Lorry must have mistaken one word for another, for no sooner had his interlocutor repeated the word story than he hastily replied:</t328>
<t329>—Yes, miss: from one of our clients.</t329> <t330>Those of us who are in the banking business usually call all our acquaintances clients.</t330> <t331>The client I am referring to was a French gentleman, a man of great talent and intellectual gifts... a doctor.</t331>
<t332>—Wouldn't it be from Beauvais, huh?</t332>
<t333>—Precisely from Beauvais.</t333> <t334>Just like Mr. Manette, your father, the gentleman in question was from Beauvais: just like Mr. Manette, your father, he was a notable figure in Paris, where I had the honor of meeting him.</t334> <t335>Our relationship was purely and exclusively business, but confidential.</t335> <t336>At that time, I was at our French office, and this was... a trifle! Twenty years ago!</t336>
<t337>—In those times...</t337> <t338>Excuse my curiosity, sir, but I would like to know...</t338>
<t339>—I am speaking of twenty years ago, miss.</t339> <t340>He married an English lady... and I was one of his trustees.</t340> <t341>The Tellson Bank handled all his business, as it did for almost all French gentlemen and families.</t341> <t342>Just as I was a trustee for that gentleman, I am or have been for dozens of the firm's clients.</t342> <t343>These are purely business relations, miss, free of friendship, free of interest, free of affection, relations in which there is nothing that resembles feeling.</t343> <t344>Throughout my life, I have moved from one to another without any leaving traces or almost any memories in me, exactly the same as I deal with the countless clients who come to the Bank daily with such varied purposes.</t344> <t345>In a word, miss: I have no feelings, I have no affection for anyone, I am a machine, I am a...</t345>
<t346>—But you are telling me the story of my father, sir, and I begin to suspect that, when my mother died, who only survived my father by two years, leaving me orphaned and alone in the world, it was you who took me to England.</t346> <t347>I would almost dare to say that it was you.</t347>
<t348>Mr. Lorry took the tiny hand that trustingly sought his, and ceremoniously brought it to his lips.</t348>
<t349>—I was, indeed, Miss Manette—replied Lorry.</t349><t350>—The fact that since then I have never seen you again will convince you of the accuracy of my words, will convince you of the truth with which I assured you a moment ago that I have no feelings, and that all the relationships I maintain or have maintained with my fellow beings have been exclusively business-related.</t350> <t351>No! No sentimentality!</t351> <t352>You have been since then the ward of Tellson's Bank, and I have had enough to do since then working on the affairs of Tellson's Bank.</t352> <t353>Feelings! I lack the time and the will to afford myself the luxury of having them!</t353> <t354>I have spent my entire life moving and turning over immense masses of money.</t354>
<t355>Having made this singular description of his daily routines, Mr. Lorry smoothed his silky wig with both hands, an unnecessary operation, as it was impossible to smooth it more than it already was, and resumed his previous posture.</t355>
<t356>—So far, miss, what I have just narrated is, as you have guessed, the story of your father.</t356> <t357>The differences come now.</t357> <t358>If your father had not died when he did...</t358> <t359>Don't be frightened!</t359> <t360>You are trembling like a leaf on the tree!</t360>
<t361>It was true.</t361> <t362>The young woman was trembling convulsively and, without uttering a word, extended both hands in a pleading gesture.</t362>
<t363>—Please, miss...!—exclaimed Lorry with extreme gentleness.</t363><t364>—Control yourself...</t364> <t365>Calm that agitation... What do feelings have to do with this?...</t365> <t366>We are talking about business...</t366> <t367>You see: I was saying...</t367>
<t368>The look the girl gave the narrator unsettled him so completely that he hesitated, stammered, had to make a rather long pause, and finally replied:</t368>
<t369>—I was saying that if Mr. Manette had not died, that if instead of dying he had disappeared unexpectedly and silently, evaporating, so to speak, that if it had not been an impossible task to guess the dreadful place where he would have been buried, although it was possible to reach him, if he had had the misfortune of incurring the animosity of some compatriot of his, vested with a power that the bravest men of my time did not dare to mention without trembling, the power to fill out orders or decrees signed in blank, by virtue of which it was easy to condemn any mortal to imprisonment and temporary or perpetual oblivion, if that gentleman's wife had implored compassion from the king, the queen, the court, the clergy, and the nobility, seeking news of her absent husband, without managing to soften any heart, then the story of the doctor from Beauvais that I am recounting would indeed be that of your father.</t369>
<t370>—For God's sake, sir, tell me more!</t370>
<t371>—That's what I'm getting at: but do you have enough courage to listen to what I have to say?</t371>
<t372>—I can bear anything except the uncertainty that your words leave me in.</t372>
<t373>—You speak calmly... and surely you are already composed: magnificent!—continued Lorry, with an expression that contradicted his last words.</t373><t374>—We are talking about business... nothing but business.</t374> <t375>Do not see in what I say anything more than a business... that can be done... that, in all likelihood, will turn out well.</t375> <t376>Let's continue: if the good doctor's wife, a lady of exceptional courage and great presence of mind, endured such sharp pains and sufferings as a result of what I have just mentioned, before her son came into the world...</t376>
<t377>—The son was a daughter, sir!...</t377>
<t378>—Well...! What difference does it make?</t378> <t379>Sex does not alter the business...</t379> <t380>I mean, miss, that if the poor lady suffered such severe pains before her daughter was born, in order to prevent this sad inheritance of her agonies from reaching her, she nursed and raised her in the belief that her father had died...</t380> <t381>Do not kneel, for God's sake...! In the name of Heaven!...</t381> <t382>Why do you fall to your knees at my feet?</t382>
<t383>—To beg you to tell me the truth...!</t383> <t384>For pity's sake, sir, hide nothing from me!...</t384>
<t385>—I will tell you everything...</t385> <t386>But calm down, for heaven's sake!</t386> <t387>We are dealing with a... a... business, miss, and its details confuse me... and it's not possible... I can't handle business properly if my ideas are confused and obscured.</t387> <t388>Let's try to clear our heads.</t388> <t389>If you can tell me right now... for example, how many pence are in nine coins of nine pence each, or how many shillings are in twenty guineas, it will greatly calm my spirit, as it will be a palpable proof of your calmness and serenity.</t389>
<t390>Without directly responding to this call, the girl allowed herself to be lifted from the ground and sat back down with such composure that she imparted to her interlocutor the courage that he was beginning to lack.</t390>
<t391>—Very good! Like that...! Much courage! Business and nothing but business!</t391> <t392>A business presents itself, a positive business, with returns.</t392> <t393>Your mother, Miss Manette, adopted with you the code of conduct that I previously hinted at.</t393> <t394>When she died... I believe from sorrow... without having ceased for a moment to search for her husband, and without ever finding out anything, she left you, a two-year-old girl, on the path to grow up beautiful, happy, without sorrows, free from the dark cloud that would have embittered your existence, if at her death she had revealed to you the story of your father, without being able to add whether he had died in prison or if he continued to be buried in the dungeon, suffering the tortures of being buried alive.</t394>
<t395>He uttered the last words, casting a gaze of infinite compassion upon the golden hair before him, as if telling himself that, thanks to the compassionate discretion of the mother, those strands did not yet abound with silver threads.</t395>
<t396>—You know perfectly well that your parents did not enjoy a great fortune, and that what they possessed passed to your mother and you.</t396> <t397>As far as money and material goods are concerned, no new discoveries have been made; but...</t397>
<t398>The narrator felt delicate hands forcefully gripping his wrists, and he stopped speaking.</t398> <t399>The expression on the girl's face was one of sorrow and horror.</t399>
<t400>—But he has been found... him.</t400> <t401>He lives, yes... very changed... I consider it probable; shattered, a wreck, reduced to a shadow of what he was... it's possible; but he lives, and we must harbor hopes that he will improve.</t401> <t402>His father has been taken to the house of a former servant of his, who resides in Paris, and we are going to meet him: I, to identify him, if I can; you, to embrace him, to restore his life, affection, calm, and rest.</t402>
<t403>The girl shuddered from head to toe.</t403> <t404>Trembling, moved, with a strange voice, like someone speaking in a dream, she said:</t404>
<t405>—I'm going to see his ghost!...</t405> <t406>His ghost!...</t406> <t407>Not him!</t407>
<t408>Lorry gently detached the hands that were gripping his arm.</t408>
<t409>—Calm down, calm down, miss!—he said.</t409><t410>—It's all over now.</t410> <t411>You know all the good and all the bad.</t411> <t412>Let's go meet the unfortunate knight, unjustly punished, and after a happy sea voyage, followed by another no less fortunate by land, you will very soon have the sweet pleasure of embracing him.</t412>
<t413>—I have lived peacefully, I have lived happily, and his ghost has never haunted me!—exclaimed the girl with the same tone of voice as before.</t413>
<t414>—Lend me another observation—replied Lorry, emphasizing the word, undoubtedly to ensure the attention of his listener.</t414> <t415>When they found him, he was using another name.</t415> <t416>His own, either they forgot it a long time ago, or someone has had an interest in hiding it.</t416> <t417>It would be worse than useless to try to find out if one or the other occurred: it would be worse than useless to try to inquire if they forgot about him, or if deliberately and intentionally they have kept him imprisoned for so many years: it would be worse than useless to conduct any kind of investigation, and it would be, because besides being useless, we would expose ourselves to great dangers.</t417> <t418>It is preferable a thousand times not to even speak of the matter, and to get his father out of France.</t418> <t419>I myself, despite being shielded from such dangers by being an English citizen, and even the Tellson Bank, with all the importance it has in France, do not dare to even mention the matter.</t419> <t420>I do not carry a single line, a single written word that clearly refers to him.</t420> <t421>In a word: it is a secret.</t421> <t422>All the credentials that authorize me to resolve it, all the instructions I have received as an agent, are reduced to a single word: "Resurrected"...</t422> <t423>But what is this!...</t423> <t424>She hasn't heard a word of what I've been saying! Miss Manette!</t424>
<t425>The girl remained in the chair, perfectly still, perfectly calm, perfectly silent, perfectly upright, perfectly insensible, her eyes open and fixed on Lorry's face, but with that singular expression that the eyes sculpted under the forehead of a statue have.</t425> <t426>Her fingers continued to grip his arm with such force that he did not dare to release them for fear of hurting her, for which reason he shouted for help, but without moving.</t426>
<t427>At the shouts, a woman of fierce appearance came running, red from head to toe, for red was the color of her face, red her hair, red her dress, red the monumental hat, similar to those worn by grenadiers or to an enormous Stilton cheese.</t427> <t428>Hot on the heels of the woman, who burst into the room, came all the maids of the inn.</t428> <t429>The first woman used little courtesy to solve the conflict of freeing Lorry's arm from the fingers that, clenched, held it, for with the first slap struck against the chest of the gentleman from Tellson's Bank, she sent him crashing against the nearest wall.</t429>
<t430>—That woman is a man!—Lorry murmured to himself, as he bumped into the wall.</t430>
<t431>—What are you looking for here, you silly girls?—roared the red woman, addressing the maids.</t431><t432>—Why don't you go scrub, instead of standing there, staring at me like idiots?</t432> <t433>Am I some kind of monkey, by any chance?</t433> <t434>Get to work!</t434> <t435>You will soon know who I am if you don't bring me salts, cold water, vinegar, and everything else I need right away!</t435>
<t436>The dispersion was general and immediate.</t436> <t437>The maids flew in search of the requested restoratives, while the red matron placed the patient on a sofa with great skill and gentleness, calling her "precious," "my little daughter," "dove," etc., etc.</t437>
<t438>—And you, you brute—she shouted next, turning furiously against Mr. Lorry,—couldn't you tell her your famous story without scaring her to death?</t438> <t439>Look at how you've made her!</t439> <t440>Pale as a corpse, cold as ice!</t440> <t441>Aren't you ashamed to call yourself a banker?</t441>
<t442>To such an extent did Mr. Lorry become bewildered by a question so difficult to answer, that he could do nothing but look from afar with an expression of extraordinary sympathy and humility, while the tremendous woman, after once again driving away the servants who had returned with water, vinegar, and salts, under the mysterious penalty of "letting them know something she had no reason to mention" if they continued staring at her in amazement, set to work and managed, after a long time, to get the girl to begin showing signs of life.</t442>
<t443>—It seems that he is feeling better—observed Mr. Lorry.</t443>
<t444>—But it won't be because of what you have done—replied the matron harshly.</t444><t445>—My daughter!</t445>
<t446>—Would you have any objection—asked Lorry with great humility, after a few moments—to accompanying her to France?</t446>
<t447>—You don't know how to say anything but nonsense!</t447> <t448>If Providence had arranged for me to ever cross the pond, do you think it would have made me be born on an island?</t448>
<t449>As answering such a question was also extremely difficult, Mr. Maurice Lorry thought it best to withdraw to ponder.</t449>
<t450>V.</t450>
<t451>THE TAVERN</t451>
<t452>A barrel of wine had fallen in the street, breaking into pieces.</t452> <t453>The accident occurred while taking the barrel out of a cart.</t453> <t454>It fell to the ground, began to roll, the hoops jumped off, and it burst open like the shell of a monstrous nut in front of the door of a tavern.</t454>
<t455>All the people in the vicinity suspended their tasks or ended their idleness to run to the scene of the accident and drink the wine.</t455> <t456>The rough, uneven, and pointed stones that made up the cobblestones of the street, seemingly placed on purpose to make as many limping people as fortunate mortals who had the luck to pass over them, had distributed the red liquid, forming a variety of ponds of different sizes, all of which were surrounded by larger or smaller groups, depending on their extent.</t456> <t457>Many men, lying face down, collected the wine in the hollow of their hands and drank, or made the women who eagerly leaned over their shoulders drink, before the liquid escaped through their fingers.</t457> <t458>Others, men and women, collected it with small earthenware vessels or soaked the women's headscarves, which they then wrung out into their mouths or those of the children: some built mud dams to stop the flow of the wine, while others, following the shouted advice from onlookers at the windows, jumped here and there to divert the course of new streams, and there were even those who, seizing the half-rotten fragments of the barrel, sucked and licked them with indescribable anxiety.</t458> <t459>It can be assured that the crowds collected not only the last drop of wine but also the last molecule of earth that had come into contact with it.</t459> <t460>The street was left as if all the city's street-sweeping brigades had just passed through, if the city had known the brilliant institution of street sweepers.</t460>
<t461>While the fun of the wine lasted, the street was filled with the clamor of joyful laughter and shouts of jubilation, launched by dozens of throats of men, women, and children.</t461> <t462>The distraction was a bit crude and very lively.</t462> <t463>Those who took part in it showed a special tendency towards affinities and confidences, which resulted in toasts of questionable taste, handshakes, hugs, and whimsical dances, in which those who had drunk the most, or those of a more jovial and fun character, took special part.</t463> <t464>When the wine ran out, and the stones and earth that had been soaked were dry and clean, the demonstrations of joy ceased as abruptly as they had begun.</t464> <t465>The individual who had left his saw leaning against the log he was sawing, grabbed it and set it in motion again; the woman who had left her pot cooking in front of her house door, returned to attend to it; the men with bare arms, dirty hair, and cadaverous faces who had emerged into the daylight minutes before, descended once again into the depths of the dark caves, and the shadows enveloped with their mantle a scene that, in reality, was painful to behold in the light of the sun.</t465>
<t466>The wine that the shattered barrel contained was red, and it stained the narrow street of the San Antonio suburb where it had spilled.</t466> <t467>It also stained many hands and many faces and many bare feet and many clogs.</t467> <t468>The hands of the man who was sawing the log left reddish marks on the boards, and the forehead of the woman who was nursing her tender child was also stained when it collided with the forehead of the old witch with whom she embraced and danced in moments of fleeting joy.</t468> <t469>Those who eagerly seized the remnants of the barrel and sucked and licked them, left the revelry with reddish circles on their mouths that gave them the appearance of fierce tigers, and there was one, undoubtedly more fond of jokes than the others, who with his finger dipped in the mixture formed by the mud and the wine, scrawled the word blood on the wall.</t469>
<t470>The day would come when blood would be spilled in torrents, and many of those who took part in the aforementioned diversion would be drenched in blood from head to toe!</t470>
<t471>Once the street of San Antonio returned to its usual state and condition, from which it had been momentarily taken by a fortuitous incident, it remained sad, dark, and gloomy, groaning under the scepter of cold, filth, disease, ignorance, and hunger, all of them powerful nobles, but particularly the one mentioned last.</t471><t472>In every corner, one could see crouched figures of the unfortunate who had been pressed and crushed one hundred times over by the heavy stones of the mill, shivering from the cold and collapsing from hunger.</t472><t473>The mill that had crushed them was not that fabulous mill that has the property of turning the old into young people full of life, but the one that turns the young into old.</t473><t474>The boys had the faces of old men, and the children had deep and grave voices.</t474><t475>Their backs bent under the weight, not of years, but of hunger, which was the mistress and lady of those neighborhoods.</t475><t476>Hunger was the word repeated in all the houses, hunger the fateful phantom mounted on the miserable rags hanging from poles or ropes stretched in front of the filthy shacks, hunger repeated all the fragments of sawdust falling under the carpenter's saw, hunger the dreadful monster that, finding no filth in the streets to feed on, climbed to the top of the chimneys, which also offered no smoke to its voracity; hunger was the inscription read in the shelves of all the bakers, hunger the word stamped on all the breads, expensive, of poor quality, and lacking in weight.</t476>
<t477>The districts where he had established his headquarters could not be more suitable for the purpose.</t477> <t478>A narrow and winding street, a filthy and foul-smelling dump, from which even narrower and more winding alleys branched off, inhabited by human rags and smelling of human rags, in which only people and things that caused nausea could be seen.</t478> <t479>In the grim expression of its inhabitants, one could glimpse fierce longings to turn things upside down.</t479> <t480>There was no shortage of emaciated faces with eyes that emitted flames, nor of clenched lips, nor of horribly furrowed brows.</t480> <t481>Even the shop signs were vivid illustrations of need.</t481> <t482>In the butcher shops and pork shops, they painted scrawny cattle, and in the bakeries, tiny, fraudulent loaves of bread.</t482> <t483>The only industry that seemed to be experiencing a period of flourishing prosperity was that of tools and weapons.</t483> <t484>The butchers' knives and axes were shiny, perfectly sharpened, the blacksmiths' hammers weighed many pounds, and the armories were packed with instruments of death.</t484> <t485>The streets, full of potholes, deposits of mud and corrupted water, lacked sidewalks.</t485> <t486>The lanterns, which hung at very long intervals from ropes, cast a sickly light that was not enough to dispel the darkness, just as the lights of lanterns placed high on the yards do not dispel the darkness of the sea.</t486> <t487>To tell the truth, Paris was a sea, and both the ship and those who manned it were in grave danger of shipwreck.</t487>
<t488>The day was bound to come when the famished inhabitants of those regions, by force of contemplating the miserable lanterns, would conceive the project of introducing improvements to the system and would hang men from those ropes to illuminate the darkness of their situation.</t488> <t489>However, the time had not yet come, and although all the breezes blowing over France were precursors of strong gales, the little birds with silky plumage remained unaware.</t489>
<t490>The tavern in front of which the scene that the readers of this story have just witnessed took place offered a better appearance than most of the taverns in those neighborhoods, and its owner, dressed in a yellow vest and green breeches, was calmly watching the struggle of those who ran to claim the spilled wine.</t490>
<t491>—I don't care—he exclaimed, shrugging his shoulders.</t491><t492>—The warehouse employees dropped it; they will bring me another barrel.</t492>
<t493>The innkeeper then happened to see the individual who was writing the word blood on the wall, and asked him:</t493>
<t494>—Hey, Gaspar; what are you doing there?</t494>
<t495>He responded with one of those significant gestures that are so common among people of his kind, and whose meaning often goes unnoticed, as happened in this case.</t495>
<t496>—Are you trying to earn your way into a madhouse?—replied the innkeeper, crossing the street and smearing a handful of mud he picked up from the ground over the word written on the wall.</t496><t497>—Can't you find another place, tell me, to write words like that?</t497>
<t498>While he was formulating the second question, the innkeeper placed his less dirty hand (perhaps by chance, perhaps intentionally) over the region of his interlocutor's heart.</t498> <t499>The latter struck his chest with his own, made a prodigious leap, and remained motionless, in a fantastic dance posture with his left arm on his hip and his right arm raised, holding between the thumb and index finger of his right hand a dirty shoe that he had previously taken off one of his feet.</t499>
<t500>The innkeeper crossed the street again and entered his establishment.</t500> <t501>He was a man of about thirty years, with a martial air and a bull's neck.</t501> <t502>He must have had a fiery temperament, for although the day was one of the coldest the Parisians had experienced in that harsh winter, he was in shirtsleeves and had them rolled up almost to his shoulders.</t502> <t503>As for headwear, he wore nothing but his natural covering: a mass of black, coarse, and curly hair.</t503> <t504>He had a dark complexion and good eyes, with an implacable gaze.</t504> <t505>He was evidently a man of great resolve and unyielding purposes, one of those men with whom it would be dangerous to meet on a narrow path bordered by two abysses, for it is certain that he would not turn back for anything or anyone.</t505>
<t506>Mrs. Defarge, the wife of the tavern keeper in question, was sitting behind the counter when he entered the establishment.</t506> <t507>She was a woman of robust constitution, approximately the same age as her husband, with watchful eyes, although very rarely did she seem to look at any particular object, large hands covered with rings, a face with energetic lines, a reserved expression, and an air of perfect composure.</t507> <t508>One of Mrs. Defarge's characteristics was never making mistakes that would harm her interests in any of the establishment's operations.</t508> <t509>Extremely sensitive to the cold, she was wrapped in furs and covered her head with a brightly colored shawl that completely covered her, though it left visible the large earrings that adorned her ears.</t509> <t510>She had her knitting in front of her, but she had left it on the counter to devote a few minutes to cleaning her teeth, which she was doing with a toothpick.</t510> <t511>Absorbed in her occupation, with her right elbow resting on her left hand, Mrs. Defarge said nothing when her husband entered the establishment, but she let out a barely perceptible little cough.</t511> <t512>The little cough, combined with a slight arching of her eyebrows, black as a raven's wing and perfectly arched, indicated to her husband the convenience of taking a look at the customers, among whom there might be someone new who had arrived at the tavern while he was out on the street.</t512>
<t513>The innkeeper cast his eyes around the room, soon fixing them on a gentleman, already advanced in years, and a young lady, seated in one of the corners.</t513> <t514>There were other patrons as well: two playing cards at a table, another two entertaining themselves at another table, their faculties focused on the domino pieces, and three more who, standing by the counter, were trying to stretch out the wine they had been served as much as possible.</t514> <t515>The innkeeper, while passing behind the counter, could notice that the elderly gentleman was saying with his eyes to his young companion:</t515>
<t516>—That's our man.</t516>
<t517>The innkeeper pretended not to notice the presence of the two unknown characters and struck up a conversation with the trio who were drinking by the counter.</t517>
<t518>—How's it going, Santiago—asked one of the three to the good Defarge,—have they drunk all the wine that came out of the barrel?</t518>
<t519>—To the last drop, Santiago—replied Defarge.</t519>
<t520>As soon as the interlocutors exchanged their first names, Mrs. Defarge coughed a little more and raised her eyebrows again.</t520>
<t521>—Rarely—observed the second of the patrons at the counter—do those miserable beasts have the chance to know what wine tastes like, or anything other than black bread and death: isn't that right, Santiago?</t521>
<t522>—It's true, Santiago—replied the innkeeper.</t522>
<t523>After the second exchange of first names, another little cough followed, accompanied by the raising of Mrs. Defarge's eyebrows.</t523>
<t524>—Ah!—exclaimed the third drinker, finishing the last sip and leaving the glass on the counter.</t524><t525>—They always have bile in their mouths, those sheep, and they live a dog's life! Am I right, Santiago?</t525>
<t526>—You are right, Santiago—was the bartender's reply.</t526>
<t527>After the third exchange of first names, Madame Defarge put down the toothpick and made an insignificant movement.</t527>
<t528>—It's true...! Distract them!—her husband murmured very quietly.</t528><t529>—Gentlemen... I have the pleasure of introducing my wife.</t529>
<t530>The three patrons took off their hats and greeted the innkeeper with individual nods of their heads, to which she responded by slightly bowing her own and looking at them one by one.</t530> <t531>Then, she casually glanced around, calmly picked up her knitting, and began to work.</t531>
<t532>—Gentlemen—replied the innkeeper, who had observed his wife with a scrutinizing look,—the room you expressed a desire to see when I went out to the street, is on the fifth floor.</t532> <t533>The staircase starts from the left courtyard, next to the window of the...</t533> <t534>But now I remember that one of you has already been there, and can guide the others.</t534> <t535>Goodbye, gentlemen!</t535>
<t536>The drinkers paid for what they had consumed and left.</t536> <t537>The innkeeper's eyes seemed to study his wife and the knitting she was doing, when the elderly gentleman stood up expressing a desire to speak a few words with Defarge.</t537>
<t538>—With great pleasure, sir—he replied, accompanying the old man to the door of the establishment.</t538>
<t539>The conference was brief, but its effects were as swift as they were decisive.</t539> <t540>Not four words had been exchanged when Defarge made a gesture of surprise, and before a minute had passed, he signaled to the old man and hurried out into the street.</t540> <t541>The gentleman nodded to the young lady, and both followed the innkeeper, leaving Madame Defarge absorbed in her knitting.</t541>
<t542>Mr. Maurice Lorry and Miss Manette, who were the visitors to the tavern, as the readers will have undoubtedly guessed, found the innkeeper by the door that moments earlier he had indicated to the three patrons with whom we have seen him exchange a few words.</t542> <t543>In the gloomy entrance that led to the equally gloomy staircase, the innkeeper knelt on one knee and brought to his lips the hand of the daughter of his former master.</t543> <t544>It was a homage, a testimony of submission, though executed with a demeanor that was anything but gentle.</t544> <t545>A few seconds had sufficed to radically transform Defarge; his face no longer reflected good humor, nor was it a mirror of frankness: on the contrary, in his reserved expression, in his angry attitude, in the fury that sparkled in his eyes, it was easy to read the dangerous man.</t545>
<t546>—It is very high... the ladder is heavy... I think you would do well to climb more calmly—said the innkeeper with a harsh tone to Mr. Lorry, at the moment he began to climb the ladder.</t546>
<t547>—Are you alone?—asked Lorry.</t547>
<t548>—Alone! Good heavens!</t548> <t549>Who do you want to accompany you?</t549>
<t550>—Always alone?</t550>
<t551>—Always.</t551>
<t552>—Because that is what he desires?</t552>
<t553>—Because the circumstances demand it.</t553> <t554>Just as he was when I saw him the day they came to ask me if I wanted to have him in my house and be discreet while running the consequent risk... just as he was then, he is now.</t554>
<t555>—Very changed?</t555>
<t556>—Changed!...</t556>
<t557>The innkeeper slammed his fist against the wall and uttered a horrendous curse.</t557> <t558>Any clear and precise response would not have produced half the effects that that explosion of fury did.</t558> <t559>Mr. Lorry's melancholy increased as he ascended the steep staircase.</t559>
<t560>Painful, very painful, it would be today to climb the stairs of one of the oldest houses located in one of the most populated neighborhoods of Paris; but at the time to which this story refers, it was almost impossible for those who did not have their senses atrophied by force of habit.</t560> <t561>All the neighbors of those immense hives left the garbage and filth on the landings of the main staircase, where they piled up without anyone caring to remove them, thus generating a mass of decomposition sufficient to poison the air, if it were not already saturated with the intangible impurities that are the natural result of misery and deprivation.</t561> <t562>Combined, the two sources of corruption created an unbearable atmosphere.</t562> <t563>Mr. Lorry, yielding to the discomfort caused by climbing that dark, dirty, and poisoned well, as well as to the agitation he observed in his young companion, which multiplied by the moment, stopped twice to rest.</t563> <t564>Each of those rests seemed to take away the last reserves of uncorrupted air, filling the space they left free with mephitic emanations that sprang from all sides.</t564>
<t565>They finally reached the top of the stairs, where they stopped for the third time.</t565> <t566>They still had to climb another section, steeper than the previous ones, and of extremely reduced dimensions, before reaching the attic.</t566> <t567>The innkeeper, who was walking ahead and constantly trying to keep a respectable distance from the young lady, as if he feared she might ask him a question, upon reaching the attic door, put his right hand into his pocket and took out a key.</t567>
<t568>—Ah!—exclaimed Lorry, unable to hide his surprise.</t568><t569>—Is the door locked?</t569>
<t570>—Yes—replied Defarge curtly.</t570>
<t571>—Do you consider it necessary to keep that unfortunate gentleman in such extreme confinement?</t571>
<t572>—I consider it necessary to have the door locked—murmured the person addressed, lowering his voice significantly and furrowing his brows terribly.</t572>
<t573>—Why?</t573>
<t574>—Why!</t574> <t575>Because he has lived locked up for so many years that he would be frightened, horrified, he would throw himself headfirst against the walls, he would die... I don't know the extremes he would go to... if he were left with the door open!</t575>
<t576>—Is it possible!</t576>
<t577>—Possible? It would be infallible, yes!—replied Defarge with a bitter tone.</t577><t578>—Indeed, we cannot complain about the attractions offered by a world in which these and other atrocities are possible, nor about the beauty of a sky that impassively watches the horrors you are witnessing...!</t578> <t579>The devil rules us!...</t579> <t580>Long live hell!</t580> <t581>Let's go in, sir, let's go in!</t581>
<t582>The dialogue that has been copied was held in such a low voice that not a single word reached the girl's ears.</t582> <t583>However, the emotion that dominated her was so intense, her face reflected such an expression of fright and such vivid anxiety, that Mr. Lorry felt it necessary to address her with some words aimed at lifting her depressed spirits.</t583>
<t584>"Courage, my dear miss!" he said.</t584><t585>"Courage!"</t585> <t586>We are pursuing a business, whose painful phase will pass in a moment.</t586> <t587>As soon as we pass through this door, we will have overcome the worst.</t587> <t588>In a few seconds, the unfortunate one will be able to begin to savor all the good, all the comfort, all the happiness that you are going to provide him.</t588> <t589>Our good friend Defarge will help us...</t589> <t590>To business, to business!</t590>
<t591>As they turned a very sharp corner, they found three men who were looking through the keyhole and the cracks of the door that our visitors were about to open.</t591> <t592>The men in question turned out to be the same ones who moments before were drinking while standing by the counter.</t592>
<t593>—The surprise your visit caused me made me forget them—said Defarge by way of explanation.</t593><t594>—Please be so kind as to leave us, friends.</t594>
<t595>The three men disappeared silently.</t595>
<t596>—Have you made Mr. Manette an object of exhibition?—asked Lorry in a very low voice with an angry expression.</t596>
<t597>—I display it, as you have just seen, to a very select group of chosen individuals.</t597>
<t598>—And do you think that's right?</t598>
<t599>—Yes, sir: I think it's fine.</t599>
<t600>—And those chosen ones, who are they? How do you choose them?</t600>
<t601>—I choose those who are true men... and are named like me: Santiago; men who should see it...</t601> <t602>But you are English, and it is useless to give you explanations that you will not understand.</t602> <t603>Please be kind enough to wait a moment.</t603>
<t604>By means of a gesture, he recommended to his companions that they remain still, and he pressed his face against a crack in the wall.</t604> <t605>Moments later, he raised his head, knocked on the door two or three times, with no other purpose, undoubtedly, than to make noise, passed the key through it several times with the same intention, finally put it in the lock, and opened it making as much noise as possible.</t605>
<t606>Slowly and silently, the door opened from the outside in, pushed by the hand of the innkeeper.</t606> <t607>He leaned his head forward and said something.</t607> <t608>A very weak voice replied.</t608> <t609>The innkeeper turned his face and indicated to his companions to follow him.</t609> <t610>Lorry wrapped his arm around the girl's waist, who was about to faint.</t610>
<t611>—Bu... siness... my dear... busi... ness!—exclaimed Lorry, turning his eyes towards the girl, from which something emerged that is not usually a product of business.</t611><t612>—Come in... come in!</t612>
<t613>—I'm scared!—replied the young woman.</t613>
<t614>—Fear of what?</t614>
<t615>—Him... my father!</t615>
<t616>Finding himself in a critical situation, due to the young woman's state of mind on one hand, and on the other hand the signals his guide was making for them to enter, Lorry lifted the former in his arms and crossed the door.</t616>
<t617>Defarge removed the key, locked the door from the inside, with the key, of course, and, having completed these operations slowly and methodically, and above all, making as much noise as he could, he began to walk with measured steps towards the window.</t617> <t618>He stopped next to it and turned halfway around.</t618>
<t619>The attic, built to be a wood storage, barely received the visit of a very scarce light, as the window, extremely narrow and almost closed to avoid the cold, hindered the passage of light so much that it was impossible to see absolutely anything.</t619> <t620>And yet someone was working in that gloomy room, for next to the window he was facing, with his back turned to the door, there was a man with hair as white as snow, sitting on a very low stool and ardently engaged in the task of sewing shoes.</t620>
<t621>VI.</t621>
<t622>THE SHOEMAKER</t622>
<t623>—Good morning—said the innkeeper, fixing his eyes on the white-haired head of the shoemaker.</t623>
<t624>—Good morning.</t624>
<t625>—Always so hardworking, huh?</t625>
<t626>After a while of anguished silence, the shoemaker raised his head and replied:</t626>
<t627>—Yes... I am working.</t627>
<t628>The languor of that voice hurt the ear.</t628> <t629>It was not that languor that follows the decline of strength, physical weakness, no, although it is undeniable that insufficient nourishment, hardships, and mistreatment received during the terrible captivity played some part in it: its special and typical characteristic came from the fact that it was a languor produced by solitude and lack of use of the voice.</t629> <t630>It was something like the echo of a sound that was born many years before and at a considerable distance: a voice that had lost the life, the timbre of a human voice, a voice that produced in the senses the same impression that the sight of a most beautiful and delicate color turned by the hand of centuries into a faint stain of indefinable hue would produce, a voice that vividly reflected the despair of a lost and abandoned human being so eloquently that any traveler whom hunger and fatigue had overcome in the solitudes of the arid desert he was traversing would recognize in its timbre the voice of his home, the voice of the loved ones he left in the world, before bowing his head to draw his last breath.</t630>
<t631>After a few minutes that the old man spent working silently, oblivious to everything around him, he looked up again.</t631> <t632>In his eyes, there was not a trace of interest, not a trace of curiosity: they simply reflected that mechanical perception, that unconscious awareness that the space where an object or a person was previously seen remains occupied.</t632>
<t633>—I would like to let a little more light in—said Defarge, whose eyes had not left the shoemaker for an instant.</t633><t634>—Can you bear it?</t634>
<t635>The questioned person paused his work; he cast his eyes on the ground, to the right and left, as if looking for something, and then raised them towards the one who had just questioned him, finally asking:</t635>
<t636>—What were you saying?</t636>
<t637>—I was asking if you could tolerate a little more light.</t637>
<t638>—I will have to tolerate her, if you let her in.</t638>
<t639>Defarge opened the window a little more.</t639> <t640>The rays of light that penetrated the attic perfectly illuminated the shoemaker, who had an unfinished shoe on his thigh.</t640> <t641>Scattered on the floor, or placed on the bench, were various tools of the trade.</t641> <t642>He was a man with a beard trimmed in any manner, but not of excessive length.</t642> <t643>In his gaunt and emaciated face, two eyes shone extraordinarily, which would have seemed large and slanted, even if they were not naturally so.</t643> <t644>The yellowish shirt he wore open at the chest revealed flabby flesh as white as paper.</t644> <t645>His skin, the old canvas blouse that covered the upper part of his body, the stockings, which, full of wrinkles, served as a wrapping for his fleshless calves, and in a word, all his garments, had acquired, by being deprived of the contact of air and light, a parchment tone that made it extremely difficult to determine the material used in their manufacture.</t645>
<t646>He had placed his hand like a screen between his eyes and the light, and all the bones of that hand were visible.</t646> <t647>He never looked at the person speaking to him without first lowering his eyes to the ground and moving them in all directions, as if he had lost the habit of associating space with sound; he never spoke without rambling, never remembered what he had just been asked, nor even what he himself was saying.</t647>
<t648>—Do you plan to finish that pair of shoes today?—asked Defarge, signaling to Lorry to come closer.</t648>
<t649>—What are you saying?</t649>
<t650>—Do you plan to finish those shoes today?</t650>
<t651>—I can't say if I think it or not.</t651> <t652>I think I do; but I don't know.</t652>
<t653>The question reminded her of the task, and she devoted herself to it once again.</t653>
<t654>Mr. Lorry approached silently, leaving the girl by the door.</t654> <t655>He had been standing next to Defarge for one or two minutes when the shoemaker raised his head.</t655> <t656>He did not show the slightest surprise at seeing two people instead of one.</t656>
<t657>"You have a visitor," observed Defarge.</t657>
<t658>—What are you saying?</t658>
<t659>—This gentleman has come to visit you.</t659>
<t660>The shoemaker looked up again, but did not stop working.</t660>
<t661>"This gentleman," replied Defarge, "knows a lot about shoes."</t661> <t662>"Show him the one you are making so he can appreciate your work."</t662> <t663>"Take it, sir."</t663>
<t664>Lorry took the shoe in her hand.</t664>
<t665>—Tell this gentleman what kind of shoe it is, and the name of the worker who makes it.</t665>
<t666>There was a longer pause than usual before the shoemaker responded.</t666>
<t667>—I have forgotten the question—he said at last.</t667><t668>—What were you saying?</t668>
<t669>—I asked you to kindly tell this gentleman what kind of shoe this is.</t669>
<t670>—It is a lady's shoe... a walking shoe, suitable for a young lady.</t670> <t671>It is fashionable, although the truth is I have never seen the fashion.</t671>
<t672>—And the name of the shoemaker?—asked Defarge.</t672>
<t673>The unfortunate man placed the knuckles of his right hand in the palm of his left, then reversed the order, placing the knuckles of the latter in the palm of the former, next he passed both over his beard and then over his forehead.</t673> <t674>The task of pulling him out of the abstraction in which he always became immersed after speaking did not yield in importance and difficulty to that of reviving a fainted person or of infusing a bit of artificial life into an almost dead body from which some revelation is hoped to be obtained.</t674>
<t675>—Did you ask my name?</t675>
<t676>—Indeed, that's what I asked.</t676>
<t677>—One Hundred Five, North Tower.</t677>
<t678>—Nothing else?</t678>
<t679>—One Hundred Five, North Tower.</t679>
<t680>Exhaling something that was neither a sigh nor a moan, he returned to the task, which he did not pause until Mr. Lorry, staring at him intently, asked:</t680>
<t681>—Your profession has not been that of a shoemaker, has it?</t681>
<t682>The interrogated man turned his sunken eyes towards Defarge, as if expecting him to answer the question for him, but since no help came from that direction, he directed them towards his interrogator, not without first fixing them on the ground:</t682>
<t683>—Hasn't my profession been that of a shoemaker?</t683> <t684>No: it hasn't been.</t684> <t685>I learned... I learned the trade... there.</t685> <t686>I taught myself.</t686> <t687>I asked to be allowed...</t687>
<t688>He lost, upon reaching this point, the thread of what he was saying.</t688> <t689>His gaze wandered errantly from one place to another until he found again the person he was speaking with, and continued, with the tone of someone who, upon waking up, resumes a conversation that sleep had interrupted:</t689>
<t690>—I asked to be allowed to learn on my own, and I learned through time and difficulties.</t690> <t691>Since then, I have done nothing but make shoes.</t691>
<t692>At the moment he reached out his hand to take the shoe from Lorry's, the latter asked him:</t692>
<t693>—Mr. Manette, don't you remember me?</t693>
<t694>The shoe fell to the ground and the cobbler remained motionless, his eyes fixed on the face of the person who was asking him.</t694>
<t695>—Mr. Manette—repeated Lorry, placing a hand on Defarge's shoulder.</t695><t696>—Don't you remember this man? Look at him closely!</t696> <t697>Look at me too!</t697> <t698>Don't the figures of your former banker, the memory of your old business, the image of your old servant rise in your mind?</t698>
<t699>While the unfortunate man, recently freed from the tomb where he had been buried alive for so many years, fixed his gaze now on Mr. Lorry, now on Defarge, his forehead revealed that in the depths of his brain, some sparks of intelligence were waging a fierce battle with the profound darkness that, reigning as the sole mistress, paralyzed all his activity.</t699> <t700>The darkness intensified, unwilling to lose its dominion; the sparks weakened and eventually died out; but they had shone, and what once shines, what once awakens, is not entirely extinguished, it can shine again.</t700> <t701>Thus it happened indeed.</t701> <t702>When moments later his gaze fell upon the youthful face of the girl who, crawling along the wall, had approached, and standing with outstretched hands, watched him, first with a mixture of infinite compassion and terror, and later with a fervent longing to press that spectral head against her chest and a fervent desire to instill in his soul the warmth of life, the light of love and hope, intelligence emerged again, but more powerfully than the first time, at the mysterious conjuring of the spark that, emanating from the young woman's soul, went to ignite that of the old man.</t702>
<t703>The shadows, stubbornly resisting, finally remained masters of the field.</t703> <t704>The old man looked at the people in front of him with less attention than before, and his eyes sought the ground with the air of gloomy abstraction that was peculiar to them.</t704> <t705>After a few seconds, he sighed, picked up the shoe, and resumed his task.</t705>
<t706>—Have you recognized him, sir?—whispered Defarge in Lorry's ear.</t706>
<t707>—I deemed it impossible at first, but even if only for brief moments, I managed to recognize the face that was so familiar to me once... Shh... silence!</t707> <t708>Let's move a little further away!</t708>
<t709>The girl had separated from the wall and was silently approaching the bench where the old man was sitting.</t709> <t710>It was a simply impressive scene.</t710> <t711>No one uttered a word.</t711> <t712>Not the slightest sound came to disturb that august silence.</t712> <t713>The girl, resembling a spirit, stood beside the shoemaker, and he worked with fervor.</t713>
<t714>It happened that after a while, the old man needed to switch the tool he was working with for the cobbler's knife.</t714> <t715>He picked it up, and when he was about to use it, he stopped.</t715> <t716>His eyes had just seen a skirt.</t716> <t717>Slowly, they rose until they found the girl's face, and there they stopped.</t717>
<t718>Gusts of terror crossed the forehead of the unfortunate man; his lips moved as if they wanted to pronounce words that his throat refused to articulate, his breathing became labored and panting, and finally he was heard to murmur:</t718>
<t719>—What is this?</t719>
<t720>The girl, down whose cheeks streams of tears were running, brought her hands, which were clasped in a pleading gesture, to her lips, kissed them, and then crossed her arms over her chest as if she held the beloved head of the old man between them.</t720>
<t721>—Are you the jailer's daughter?—he asked.</t721>
<t722>—No—she sighed.</t722>
<t723>—Who are you, then?</t723>
<t724>Understanding the impossibility of articulating a word, the young woman took a seat on the bench next to the old man.</t724> <t725>He wanted to move away, but felt the sweet pressure of his companion's hand on his arm, and, leaving the knife on the bench, he remained contemplating her.</t725>
<t726>The girl's golden hair, styled in long ringlets, fell over her shoulders.</t726> <t727>The old man slowly and timidly reached out a hand to touch it; their eyes lit up, but the light that had momentarily shone in his intelligence faded, and, letting out a sigh, he bowed his head and tried to resume his work.</t727>
<t728>His abstraction lasted very little time.</t728> <t729>After directing two or three glances at the shoe, as if to make sure it was still on his knee, he resolutely placed it on the bench, brought his hands to his neck, and untied a dirty and blackened cord that surrounded it, from which hung a small cloth bag.</t729> <t730>Placing the bag on his knee, he carefully opened it and took out two locks of hair, which he examined closely.</t730>
<t731>—It's the same one!—he murmured.</t731><t732>—How is it possible?</t732> <t733>When did it happen? How did it happen?</t733>
<t734>His forehead lit up more than ever.</t734> <t735>Turning towards the girl, he took her head in his hands, positioned it so that the light from the window fell fully on her face, and after a long moment of silent contemplation, he said:</t735>
<t736>—That night, the night they called me out, she had rested her head on my shoulder...</t736> <t737>She feared that I would go out... I didn't feel the slightest apprehension... and when they locked me in the North Tower, they found this hidden in my sleeve...</t737> <t738>«Will you allow me to keep it?»—I asked them.</t738><t739>—They shall not facilitate the escape of my body... although thanks to them, my spirit will frequently pass through the bars».</t739> <t740>Those were the words I said to them...</t740> <t741>I remember them as if I had just spoken them.</t741>
<t742>For a long time, his lips moved before he managed to articulate the words that are transcribed, but when he could speak, he did so perfectly, albeit very slowly.</t742>
<t743>—I don't understand...—he added.</t743><t744>—Was it you?</t744>
<t745>The two silent witnesses of the scene advanced alarmed upon observing the abruptness with which the old man turned towards the girl; but she, perfectly calm, said to them in a very low voice:</t745>
<t746>—I beg you, my good sirs, not to come closer, not to speak, not to move.</t746>
<t747>—Shh!—exclaimed the old man.</t747><t748>—Who is speaking?</t748>
<t749>He put the curls back in the little bag and wanted to tie the string around his neck again, but without taking his eyes off the young woman and shaking his head with an expression of somber pain.</t749>
<t750>—No, no, no!—he replied.</t750><t751>—It is not possible!...</t751> <t752>You are too young, too much of a child!</t752> <t753>You see the effects of being buried in a prison!...</t753> <t754>These are not the hands she knew, nor this the face she saw, nor this the voice that sounded so sweet in her ears...</t754> <t755>No, no! She... and he...</t755> <t756>Many years ago... many eternities... before the slow centuries of the North Tower... Tell me! What is your name, beautiful angel?</t756>
<t757>The daughter fell to her knees at the feet of the unhappy father, her hands clasped in front of her chest.</t757>
<t758>—Oh, sir!—he exclaimed.</t758><t759>—On another occasion, you will know my name, who my mother was, and who my unfortunate father was, whose painful story never reached my ears!</t759> <t760>I cannot say it at this moment or in this place.</t760> <t761>The only thing I can tell you now, right here, is to embrace and bless me!</t761> <t762>Yes...! Kiss me... kiss me!</t762>
<t763>The snow-white hair mingled with the golden hair.</t763>
<t764>—If my voice... I don't know if it will be so, but I hope... if my voice awakens in you echoes of another voice that in better years sounded in your ears like delightful music...</t764> <t765>cry for her... cry for her!</t765> <t766>If my hair reminds you of a beloved head that happily and joyfully rested on your chest when you were young and free, cry for her, cry for her!</t766> <t767>If upon seeing yourself in the home that awaits us, memories of another home arise in your mind, deserted and ruined many years ago, another home that fell to pieces while your heart languished and died within the black walls of a dungeon, cry for it... cry for it!</t767>
<t768>The young woman, while saying these words, held the old man's white head in her arms and rocked it as if he were a child.</t768>
<t769>—Cry too, dear... dear sir, if when I tell you that your agonies are over forever, that I have come to take you with me to England, where you can enjoy peace and perhaps happiness, I am the cause of you remembering a life that could have been so useful to your fellow men, and that, however, has been wasted!</t769> <t770>Cry, shed bitter tears over our homeland, over France, which has been so cruel to you!</t770> <t771>And if when I reveal my name to you, if when I tell you my father's name, who is still alive, and my mother's name, who has died, you know that I will have to fall to my knees at the feet of my beloved father, and that I will need to beg his forgiveness for not having spent every day of my life awake and working to help him, and crying every night, because the love of my unfortunate mother wanted to keep the bitter cup of pain away from my lips, hiding the horrible story from me, cry... cry for her... cry for me too!</t771> <t772>My good sirs!...</t772> <t773>Let us thank God!</t773> <t774>I feel the sacred tears of... this gentleman running down my face, and I feel the sobs of his chest echoing in my heart! Oh!...</t774> <t775>Thank you... thank you, my God!</t775>
<t776>The old man had fallen into the girl's arms, with his head resting on her chest.</t776> <t777>So moving was the scene, and so terrible at the same time, as it was the result of horrendous injustices and tremendous sufferings, that the two witnesses had to cover their faces with their hands.</t777>
<t778>When tranquility was restored in the attic, and the old man's chest, which for a long while seemed about to burst into pieces, regained the serenity that always follows the most violent storms... which is what happens with humanity, whose storms, which we call life, eventually calm down, giving way to rest and silence; when the old man was calm, the two witnesses approached to lift the father and daughter from the ground.</t778> <t779>The former had been languishing until he fell to the ground, lacking strength.</t779> <t780>The daughter fell with him, and remained on the ground, her head resting on his shoulder and her golden hair spread over her eyes.</t780>
<t781>—If it were possible—said the girl, reaching out a hand to Lorry—to arrange everything to leave Paris immediately, in such a way that from this very house...</t781>
<t782>—We must keep one important thing in mind—replied Lorry, interrupting the young woman.</t782><t783>—Is he ready to undertake the journey?</t783>
<t784>—I believe that the journey, with all its inconveniences, must be more beneficial to him than staying in Paris, where he has suffered so much.</t784>
<t785>—Nothing more certain—interjected Defarge, who had knelt down to see and hear better.</t785><t786>—Even disregarding the consideration that the young lady just hinted at, a thousand reasons advise that he leaves France as soon as possible.</t786> <t787>Do you want me to hire a post chaise with horses?</t787>
<t788>—The business is that—observed Lorry, who needed very little to return to his favorite topic—and when a business needs to be concluded, the sooner it is finished, the better.</t788>
<t789>—In that case—said Miss Manette,—please leave us here.</t789> <t790>You have seen how calm he has become, which should convince you that you can leave me alone with him without the slightest fear.</t790> <t791>If you would be so kind as to lock the door when you leave, to protect us from interruptions, I dare to guarantee that when you return, you will find him as calm as you leave him.</t791> <t792>I will take care of him while you make the preparations.</t792> <t793>The essential thing is to take him away as soon as possible.</t793>
<t794>The solution was not much to the liking of Lorry and Defarge, as both would have preferred not to leave the girl alone with the old man, but since it was not only necessary to prepare the post chaise but also to obtain passports, and time was pressing because the day was drawing to a close, it was imperative that they divide the necessary tasks between the two of them, after which they each went their separate ways.</t794>
<t795>The shadows of the night found the girl lying on the hard ground, watching over her father.</t795> <t796>Neither she nor the old man changed their posture until Lorry and Defarge entered the attic, who had finished the travel preparations and brought, in addition to blankets and travel coats, bread, cold meat, wine, and hot coffee.</t796> <t797>Defarge, the bearer of the provisions, placed them on the shoemaker's bench (there were no other pieces of furniture in the attic except for the bench and a mattress), and with Lorry's cooperation, lifted the captive.</t797>
<t798>No one would have been able to read in the expressionless apathy of his face the mysteries among which the old man's intelligence probably wandered aimlessly, nor would human insight, no matter how subtle and perceptive, have been able to determine whether he retained any memory of what had happened, if he remembered what he had been told, or if he realized that he was free.</t798> <t799>They tried to probe him with a barrage of questions; but the responses were so slow and confused that, fearing to disorient him further, they decided to leave him in peace for the time being.</t799> <t800>The old man's expression was one of senselessness, of ferocity, almost.</t800> <t801>He frequently pressed his head between his hands, something he had not been seen to do before; however, his face softened as soon as his daughter's voice reached his ears, and he invariably turned his head towards her whenever she spoke to him.</t801>
<t802>With that peculiar submission of those who have long been accustomed to obey the whip, he ate and drank what was given to him, and put on the travel coat that was handed to him.</t802> <t803>Without resistance, moreover, with evident pleasure, he let his daughter link her arm with his... and not content with that, he took and held her hand between his own.</t803>
<t804>They began to descend.</t804> <t805>Defarge went ahead, providing light, and Lorry brought up the rear.</t805> <t806>They had not descended many stairs when the old man stopped and looked attentively upward first, and then around.</t806>
<t807>—Do you remember the place, my father? Do you remember when you climbed these stairs?—asked the girl.</t807>
<t808>—What are you saying?</t808>
<t809>Before the question was repeated, the old man answered, as if it had been asked again.</t809>
<t810>—Do I remember?</t810> <t811>No; I don't remember.</t811> <t812>It's been so long!</t812>
<t813>Clearly, it was seen that he retained no memory of having been moved from the prison to the attic.</t813> <t814>Those who accompanied him heard him murmur "One Hundred and Five, North Tower," and it was undeniable that when he looked around, he believed he saw the thick walls that for so many years had been his tomb.</t814> <t815>He walked with an altered step as they crossed the courtyard, as if expecting to find the drawbridge; and upon realizing that it did not exist, and seeing the carriage waiting in the street, he let go of his daughter's hand and pressed his head again.</t815>
<t816>There were no mobs in front of the door, no heads seen in the windows nor a living soul in the street.</t816> <t817>Silence and solitude reigned as the only lords.</t817> <t818>They saw no one except for one person, Madame Defarge... who was knitting and saw nothing.</t818>
<t819>The prisoner had already settled himself inside the carriage, his daughter had followed him, and at the moment when Lorry was placing his foot on the step, he was stopped by the voice of the old man who asked for his shoemaker's tools and his unfinished shoes.</t819> <t820>Madame Defarge immediately said that she would go up to fetch them, and indeed, a second later, she was crossing the courtyard, knitting.</t820> <t821>She soon reappeared and handed over the requested items, after which she returned to her seat and resumed her knitting... without seeing anything.</t821>
<t822>Defarge mounted the coach box, gave the order "To the Barrier," the postilion cracked the whip, and the post chaise took off flying.</t822>
<t823>Crossing under hundreds of hanging lanterns, which shone more brightly in the better streets and with a dimmer, sadder light in the less important ones, in front of profusely illuminated shops, groups of cheerful and lively people, cafés, and theaters, they arrived at one of the city gates, where they were stopped by the soldiers on guard.</t823>
<t824>—Passports, travelers!</t824>
<t825>—Here they are, officer—replied Defarge from the coachman's seat, but immediately jumping to the ground and taking the officer aside.</t825><t826>—These are the passports of the gentleman with the white hair, who is inside, which were entrusted to me, along with his person, in...</t826>
<t827>Here Defarge lowered his voice so much that only the officer could hear what he said.</t827>
<t828>A portion of lanterns surrounded the carriage.</t828> <t829>One of them entered through the door, attached to an arm wearing a military uniform, the eyes of the owner of that arm scrutinized the interior, and especially the old man with the white head, and his lips said.</t829>
<t830>—Alright.</t830> <t831>Go ahead.</t831>
<t832>Under the immense vault of the eternal luminaries, some of them so distanced from this microscopic world that, if we are to believe what the wise assure us, it is doubtful that their glows have had time to reach us, reigned a gloomy, stormy, and cold night.</t832> <t833>The darkness insisted on not granting a moment of respite to Mr. Maurice Lorry, who, seated in front of the man buried alive, did not cease to hear insistent, terrible, obstinate, the ancient question, undoubtedly posed by them.</t833>
<t834>—I suppose you're interested in living?</t834>
<t835>The answer was also the same as always.</t835>
<t836>—I can't say it.</t836>

<t841>Already in the year seventeen eighty, the headquarters of the Tellson Bank could boast of its respectable old age.</t841> <t842>It was a very small, very dark, very dirty, and very uncomfortable building.</t842> <t843>The partners of the House prided themselves on its smallness, prided themselves on its darkness, prided themselves on its dirtiness, and prided themselves on its discomforts: moreover, their greatest badge of honor was that it possessed these qualities to an eminent degree, and they held the intimate conviction that if it were less small, less dark, less dirty, and less uncomfortable, it would be much less respectable.</t843> <t844>And note that this was not a passive belief; not at all: it was a weapon they wielded against other similar houses established in luxurious buildings.</t844> <t845>The Tellson house, they said, does not need halls, does not need light, does not need comforts or luxuries.</t845> <t846>Let Noakes and Company, or Snooks Brothers, have those, that's fine; but the Tellson house... Horrors!</t846>
<t847>Any of the partners would have been capable of disinheriting the most pampered child who dared to even hint at the convenience of rebuilding the social domicile.</t847> <t848>In this regard, the house was very similar to the nation, which frequently disinherits those children who take their inconceivable audacity to the scandalous extreme of proposing improvements and advances in laws or customs that everyone recognizes and admits are bad, but which precisely for this reason are more respectable.</t848>
<t849>So, we agreed that the Tellson house was something like a glorification of discomforts and inconveniences.</t849> <t850>Those of my readers who might have had the need or desire to visit the Tellson house, after opening a door that would have welcomed them with harsh and strident creaks, and descending two steps, would have found themselves in a miserable hovel, where two employees, as old as time, sitting behind two rickety counters, would have snatched the check or checks from their hands, to examine the signatures by the light of the dirtiest window imaginable, windows that barely let light filter through, for aside from the fact that their panes were never cleaned of the layer of mud that was thrown at them from the street the same day they were installed, they were defended by thick rusty iron bars and enjoyed the protective shade of the Temple Court.</t850> <t851>If business had obliged anyone to tour "the house," this anyone would have been led to a kind of Condemned Cell, located at the back of the building, where they would have remained making philosophical reflections on the futility of life until the house presented itself, with hands in pockets.</t851> <t852>Money entered or left from drawers of wood gnawed by woodworms.</t852> <t853>The banknotes smelled of mold, as if they were in full decomposition.</t853> <t854>Silver piled up in deposits that, without a doubt, were in communication with the latrines, two or three days were enough to rob it of its peculiar shine.</t854> <t855>Anyone who went to deposit titles or securities of any kind in the Bank could be assured that, once closed in rooms that were once kitchens or stables, they would soon smell of leftover stews or manure, and if a fatal thought induced them to bring family documents or papers, these were kept in a chamber on the upper floor, in the center of which was a dining table, although a meal was never served on it, where the letters written by their first love, or by their tender children, were condemned, in the full year of seventeen eighty, to suffer the horror of being the target of the gazes of the heads that an insensate brutality and a ferocity worthy of Abyssinia or the Ashantis daily exposed in the Temple Court.</t855>
<t856>It is true that in those happy times, the death penalty was a universal panacea, a very fashionable prescription in all trades and professions, and the Tellson Bank was not going to be an exception, far from it.</t856> <t857>If Nature remedies everything with death, why shouldn't the law do the same?</t857> <t858>Nothing, then, was more natural and logical than imposing the death penalty on the forger, the death penalty on the bearer of a counterfeit bill, the death penalty on the one who improperly opened a letter, the death penalty on the one who stole forty shillings and sixpence.</t858> <t859>He who guarded a horse at the doors of the Tellson Bank and disappeared with the animal was condemned to death, those who minted a counterfeit shilling were condemned to death, and three-quarters of mortals who brushed against the boundaries of crime paid with their heads.</t859> <t860>It is true that the penal sanction, being a little severe, far from preventing, far from reducing transgressions, multiplied them, but at least it concluded, once and for all, with the annoyances and inconveniences attached to each particular case.</t860> <t861>So many lives had been reaped by the Tellson Bank, and like it, all its contemporary similar establishments, that if the heads of the dead had been piled up in front of its facade, it is almost certain that they would have completely blocked the scant light that penetrated its interior through its dirty windows.</t861>
<t862>Perched on implausible benches and chests of strange shapes, the old employees of the Bank worked with extreme gravity and composure of a sphinx.</t862> <t863>When a young person was admitted, they were locked up who knows where and did not reappear until they were old.</t863> <t864>Evidently, they kept them, like cheese, in some dark chamber until they had acquired the peculiar smell of the House.</t864>
<t865>Outside the building, whose door he was never allowed to cross without being called, there was an old man, vested with the functions of doorman and messenger, who was something like the living emblem of the house.</t865> <t866>He never left the door during office hours, unless he was sent on an errand, and even then, his son, a twelve-year-old rascal who was his spitting image, would stand in for him at the door.</t866> <t867>There were no lack of malicious people who claimed that the house merely tolerated the old man in question, whom they nicknamed Lapa, although many years earlier, in the parish church of Houndsditch, where tired of being confined and in darkness, he wanted to glimpse the light of the world, he was given the name Jeremiah.</t867>
<t868>The private residence of the high-ranking employee Lapa was the scene of the incident I am about to narrate, at half past seven on a windy morning in the month of March, in the Year of Our Lord, seventeen hundred and eighty.</t868> <t869>I say Anno Domini instead of Year of Our Lord to conform to the manner of speaking of the very wise Lapa, who, believing that the Christian era originated from the invention of the game of dominoes by a lady named Ana, always prefixed the words Ana Dominó to the year when speaking of dates.</t869>
<t870>The private rooms of the good Lapa were not decorated and furnished with excessive luxury, nor were there more than two, counting a wardrobe as one, but they were clean and tidy.</t870> <t871>Despite the untimely hour and the unpleasant windy March morning, the room in which he was snoring like a log had been swept and mopped, and on the table, a little wobbly, covered with a tablecloth as white as snow, the glasses, plates, and other utensils necessary for lunch were shining.</t871>
<t872>The gentleman Lapa snored under the bed covers as any Harlequin might snore in his own home.</t872> <t873>The sleep was deep; but eventually, the covers began to stir, Lapa tossed and turned with a restless air, and after a while, some quills appeared on the sheets that miraculously did not tear them, and which were the natural protection Nature had endowed his head with.</t873> <t874>As the hairs emerged, their owner exclaimed in an exasperated voice.</t874>
<t875>—May I be impaled if he hasn't gone back to his old ways!</t875>
<t876>A woman, the epitome of industriousness and order, rose from a corner, where she had been kneeling, with enough haste to demonstrate that the angry words of the sleeper were directed at her.</t876>
<t877>—So back to the usual, huh?—replied Lapa, reaching out an arm in search of a boot.</t877>
<t878>The boot went flying through the air along with this second salutation.</t878> <t879>It was a dirty boot, full of mud; and since we are talking about boots, I will mention, as a circumstance that is not without strangeness, that while Mr. Lapa often returned home after finishing his service at the Bank with clean boots, it was rare for him to wake up in the morning without finding them full of mud.</t879>
<t880>—What were you doing there, pious one of the demons?—shouted the mellifluous Lapa, after missing the shot.</t880>
<t881>—He was praying.</t881>
<t882>—He was praying!... What a fine occupation!</t882> <t883>And what do you hope to achieve, spending your time on your knees praying against me?</t883>
<t884>—I do not pray against you, but for you.</t884>
<t885>—It's not true; and even if it were, I won't tolerate you taking such liberties.</t885> <t886>Indeed, you have been lucky to have a model mother, my son!... Just imagine!</t886> <t887>A mother who prays against your father's prosperity!</t887> <t888>A mother so religious, so zealous in fulfilling her duty, that she spends her time asking Heaven and Hell to snatch from the mouth of her only son the toast with butter that constitutes his food!</t888> <t889>What do you think!</t889>
<t890>The dignified offspring of Mr. Lapa must have found the latter part of his speech very displeasing, as he loudly demanded that his mother never again mix anything related to his personal diet with her prayers.</t890>
<t891>—And what do you suppose, foolish woman, that your prayers are worth?—replied the husband, with unconscious insistence.</t891><t892>—Tell me: what value do you place on your prayers?</t892>
<t893>—They spring from the heart, Jeremiah; this is their only merit.</t893>
<t894>—His only merit!—repeated Mr. Lapa.</t894><t895>—Then they are worth little!</t895> <t896>In any case, whatever they are worth, I don't want you to pray again: come on, it's over!</t896> <t897>Do you think I'm going to tolerate you calling bad luck upon my head?</t897> <t898>If you want to fall to your knees, do it in favor of your husband and your son, and not against them.</t898> <t899>Last week, if hell hadn't given me an unnatural wife, and an unnatural mother to this poor child, I would have earned heaps of gold instead of having the darkest shadow that any mortal has had since the world began.</t899> <t900>Get dressed, my son, get dressed; and while I clean my boots, don't take your eyes off your mother, and alert me with a shout if you notice any signs that she is going to fall to her knees.</t900> <t901>I assure you I can't stand it—he added, addressing his wife.</t901><t902>—I am more brutish than a rental carriage, I sleep like laudanum, I rarely know if I am myself or if I am the neighbor across the street; but when they mess with my pocket, I get wary; I don't want any jokes with the pocket, know this once and for all, and if your prayers conspire against it, you're going to have a hard time, pious woman of hell!</t902>
<t903>Mr. Lapa, occasionally uttering phrases of indignation, vigorously set about the task of cleaning his boots.</t903> <t904>His son, meanwhile, whose head was adorned with spikes slightly less sharp than his father's, and whose little eyes were just about as close together as his father's, persistently watched his mother.</t904> <t905>He gave the poor woman several frights by shouting from the bottom of the wardrobe, where he was getting dressed.</t905>
<t906>—Father!...</t906> <t907>He's kneeling... he's kneeling!</t907>
<t908>Not even with lunch did Lapa's mood sweeten; on the contrary, it seemed to increase his animosity towards his wife.</t908>
<t909>—But what are you doing?</t909> <t910>Again, you wretch?</t910>
<t911>The woman replied that she had done nothing but implore the blessing of Heaven.</t911>
<t912>—Be careful with bringing blessings!—he muttered, looking as if he feared seeing the bread disappear from the table due to the efficacy of his wife's prayer.</t912><t913>—I want to banish blessings from my house...! I don't want blessings on my table!</t913>
<t914>Red with anger, with his eyes bulging out of their sockets, Mr. Lapa devoured, rather than ate, his lunch, grumbling and growling like any of his four-legged kin might do.</t914> <t915>Around nine in the morning, his naturally irritable temper somewhat tamed, he left his house to attend to the day's tasks.</t915>
<t916>His occupation scarcely deserved the name, yet he called himself an "honest craftsman."</t916> <t917>Every morning, he placed a bench, made from the backrest of a broken chair, beneath the window of the Tellson Bank closest to the Temple Court.</t917> <t918>The bench, and a few handfuls of straw he took from the first cart passing by loaded with it, constituted all his belongings.</t918> <t919>Mr. Lapa and his bench were as well-known on Fleet Street as the Temple itself... and with little difference, of such an unpleasing appearance.</t919>
<t920>Installed in his spot before nine, in time to be able to raise his hand to his tricorn hat whenever someone whose respectability deserved it entered or left Tellson's Bank, Mr. Lapa, accompanied by his son, spent that windy March morning mentally and physically insulting any children or adults who came within his reach, for lack of better occupation.</t920> <t921>Father and son, who bore a remarkable resemblance to each other, looked more like a pair of monkeys than human beings.</t921> <t922>Jeremiah the elder chewed on straws, while the bright little eyes of Jeremiah the younger restlessly watched the morning traffic on Fleet Street, when one of the bank's messengers poked his head through the establishment's door and said in a booming voice:</t922>
<t923>—Let the doorman in!</t923>
<t924>—We already have a task at hand to start the day, father—observed the younger Jeremiah.</t924>
<t925>The father gave the bench to the son, and the latter sat down, picking up and putting into his mouth the straw that the former was chewing.</t925>
<t926>II.</t926>
<t927>A VISIT</t927>
<t928>—Do you know the Old Bailey well?—asked one of the oldest employees of the Bank to Jeremiah Lapa.</t928>
<t929>[1] Central Criminal Court of London:—(Translator's Note).</t929>
<t930>—Yes... sir—replied the questioned one with a certain sarcasm.</t930><t931>—I know Bailey.</t931>
<t932>—Perfectly.</t932> <t933>You also know Mr. Lorry, don't you?</t933>
<t934>—I know Mr. Lorry much better than the Bailey, sir... much more than I, an honest craftsman through and through, wish to know the Bailey.</t934>
<t935>—Very well.</t935> <t936>You will go to the door reserved for witnesses, where you will show the guard this note for Mr. Lorry.</t936> <t937>They will let you pass without difficulty.</t937>
<t938>—To the Hall of Justice?</t938>
<t939>—To the Hall of Justice.</t939>
<t940>—Should I wait in the Hall, sir?</t940>
<t941>—I am going to tell you what you must do.</t941> <t942>The gatekeeper will deliver this note to Mr. Lorry, and you, from wherever you are, will try to attract Mr. Lorry's attention by any gesture, so that he knows where you are waiting.</t942> <t943>Then, all your duties are reduced to one: to wait until Mr. Lorry needs you.</t943>
<t944>—Nothing else?</t944>
<t945>—Nothing more.</t945> <t946>Mr. Lorry wishes to have a messenger on hand; the essential thing is to let him know that the messenger he can rely on at any given moment is you.</t946>
<t947>While the bank employee folded the paper and stamped the envelope, the good Lapa, who watched him without uttering a word until he saw him reach for the blotting paper, asked.</t947>
<t948>—Do they rule on any forgery cases today?</t948>
<t949>—For treason.</t949>
<t950>—Certain dismemberment!—exclaimed Lapa.</t950><t951>—What an atrocity!</t951>
<t952>—It's the law—replied the old man, turning his eyes towards Lapa with surprise,—the law, and nothing but the law.</t952>
<t953>—As respectable as the law may be, it seems barbaric to me to tear a man apart.</t953> <t954>It is cruel enough to take his life, but to quarter him, I find it savage.</t954>
<t955>—Try to speak well of the law, my friend—replied the employee.</t955><t956>—Keep your observations to yourself, seal your lips, and let the law take care of itself: it is advice that you would do well not to forget.</t956>
<t957>—Ah sir!</t957> <t958>It is the hard life I lead that moves my tongue!—exclaimed Lapa.</t958><t959>—I leave it to your judgment to decide if someone who earns the crust of bread I put in my mouth the way I do, can keep their lips sealed.</t959>
<t960>—We all earn our bread by the sweat of our brow, though some with less toil than others...</t960> <t961>Take the letter... and let's go.</t961>
<t962>The messenger took the letter, bowed, and left.</t962>
<t963>They used to hang people at Tyburn back then, and consequently, the street where Newgate stood had not yet gained the grim notoriety that later weighed upon it.</t963> <t964>It was, however, a dreadful prison, where all kinds of villainies and atrocities were practiced, a hotbed of the most terrible diseases, which often entered the Hall of Justice with the prisoners, preyed upon, showing very little regard, the very Chief Justice, and forced him to abandon his high seat forever.</t964> <t965>It often happened that the judge with the black cap pronounced his own sentence along with that of the accused, and even died sooner than the latter.</t965> <t966>Moreover, the Bailey was like an inn through whose spacious hallway pale travelers constantly departed, mounted on carts or coaches, heading to the other world after a journey of two or three miles of public streets and roads, instilling healthy fear in some citizens, perhaps in none: such is the power of habit.</t966> <t967>It was also famous for the pillory, a shrewd and happy institution that implied a punishment whose extent and reach no one could foresee; it was also known for the posts where those condemned to the penalty of whipping were tied, a system most suitable for softening customs and sweetening temperaments, as well as for the myriad deals made there, in which gold entered on one side and the shedding of blood on the other, a remnant of the indisputable wisdom of our ancestors, which systematically led to the perpetration of the most heinous mercenary crimes that could be committed under the sky.</t967> <t968>Furthermore, the Old Bailey at that time was an eloquent demonstration of the precept, "All that is, is just," an aphorism that would be as foolish as it is innocent if it did not carry the highly detrimental consequence that "Nothing that has existed was unjust."</t968>
<t969>Making his way through that motley crowd, which filled the repugnant scene where the action was to unfold, with the skill of one accustomed to walking among people, the messenger soon reached the door he was looking for, where he delivered the letter he was carrying, passing it through a small window made in the door itself. It should be noted that those who wished to see the performances at the Old Bailey had to pay for their seats just like those who wanted to entertain themselves by visiting the Asylum, with the only difference being that it was more expensive to enter the former than the latter.</t969> <t970>As a result, all the doors were perfectly guarded, except, of course, for those that gave access to the criminals, as these were always found wide open.</t970>
<t971>With some delay, and not without the guard muttering a few words of discontent, the door swung on its hinges to allow the messenger to pass through.</t971>
<t972>—What's up?—he asked the first man he encountered.</t972>
<t973>—Nothing yet.</t973>
<t974>—What will happen next?</t974>
<t975>A view by betrayal.</t975>
<t976>—Safe dismemberment, huh?</t976>
<t977>—Ah! First, laid out on a hurdle, they will drag him to the place where the gallows await him, there they will half-hang him, they will lower him from the gallows to rip out his entrails, which they will burn before his eyes, then they will cut off his head, and finally they will quarter him.</t977> <t978>That is the sentence.</t978>
<t979>—Assuming that he is declared guilty, you mean.</t979>
<t980>—Bah! They will declare him guilty, don't you worry!</t980>
<t981>Mr. Lapa then paid attention to the doorkeeper, whom he saw heading straight towards Mr. Lorry with the letter in his hand.</t981> <t982>Mr. Lorry was seated at a table among gentlemen suitably bewigged, very close to the defendant's lawyer, who wore an enormous wig and had several bundles of papers under his eyes, and almost opposite another gentleman, no less bewigged than the lawyer, who, when Mr. Lapa saw him, as well as afterwards, had his hands in his pockets, his entire attention focused on the ceiling.</t982> <t983>With a series of coughing fits, the messenger managed to catch Mr. Lorry's attention, who immediately stood up, nodded, and sat back down.</t983>
<t984>—What role does that play in the process?—asked Lapa to the individual who had previously asked him that question.</t984>
<t985>—Hang me if I know.</t985>
<t986>—So... if the question isn't too personal, what role do you play?</t986>
<t987>—May I be torn apart if I know either.</t987>
<t988>The entrance of the judge into the courtroom put an end to the dialogue.</t988> <t989>From that moment on, all the attention, all the interest of the public was focused on the bar.</t989> <t990>The jailers, who until that moment had been on either side of the bar, left only to return moments later with the prisoner.</t990>
<t991>All eyes, except those of the gentleman with the wig, who had his fixed on the ceiling, were fixed on those of the prisoner, all the human breaths in the room directed towards him, like the sea, like fire, like the wind.</t991> <t992>Clinging to the columns, protruding from the corners, faces reflecting anxiety could be seen, the spectators in the last rows stood up, others rose on tiptoe, and many climbed onto the benches in their eagerness to see everything.</t992> <t993>Jeremiah Lapa was not among those who showed the least curiosity, standing like an animated piece of the spiked wall of Newgate and shooting at the prisoner waves of breath saturated with beer vapors—he had had a glass on the way—which mixed with those coming from other mouths, saturated with emanations of gin, coffee, and tea.</t993>
<t994>The object of such lively curiosity was a young man of about twenty-five years, handsome, good-looking, with round cheeks and black eyes.</t994> <t995>He was a gentleman.</t995> <t996>He was dressed in black, or very dark gray, and his hair, which was long and chestnut, fell over his back, tied with a ribbon.</t996> <t997>In the same way that the emotions of the human soul filter through the material envelope, so the one engendered by the situation in which he found himself was manifested by a pallor superimposed on the dark and weathered complexion of the accused, demonstrating that his soul was stronger than the sun.</t997> <t998>He showed himself, however, perfectly in control.</t998> <t999>With marvelous calm, he bowed to the judge and waited:</t999>
<t1000>Feelings of elevated humanity in the interest that the defendant aroused in the Hall?</t1000> <t1001>Not at all!</t1001> <t1002>If the sentence that loomed over his head had been less terrifying, if there had been any likelihood that some of its ferocious details would be omitted in its execution, the fascination would have suffered a severe blow.</t1002> <t1003>Before the spectators' eyes stood the arrogant body that would very soon be condemned to barbaric mutilations, the creature endowed with an immortal soul about to be torn apart, quartered, and the interest it inspired, no matter what those who felt it might say, was, at its root, in its essence, the interest of the ogre.</t1003>
<t1004>Silence in the Courtroom!</t1004>
<t1005>—Carlos Darnay, as the accused was called, had denied the previous day the terrible accusation leveled against him.</t1005> <t1006>If true, Carlos Darnay was a traitor and disloyal to our serene, august, excellent, etc. etc.</t1006> <t1007>King and Lord, for having aided on various occasions and by various means Louis, King of France, in his wars against our serene, august, excellent, etc., etc. King and Lord.</t1007> <t1008>He had made frequent trips between the domains of our serene, august, excellent, etc., etc.</t1008> <t1009>King and Lord and those of the said King of France, with the purpose of revealing iniquitously, treacherously, disloyally (and many other adverbial qualifiers) to the aforementioned King of France the military forces that our serene, august, excellent, etc. etc.</t1009> <t1010>King and Lord had prepared to send to Canada and North America.</t1010>
<t1011>Such were, in substance, the facts that Jeremiah Lapa had managed to acquire with enormous satisfaction.</t1011>
<t1012>The accused, whom everyone present had mentally hanged, beheaded, and quartered in plain sight, neither trembled at the situation nor affected theatrical arrogance.</t1012> <t1013>He saw with perfect calm that the judges were taking their oaths and that the Crown prosecutor was preparing to speak.</t1013> <t1014>With grave interest, he witnessed the preparations, and with such composure he listened to the proceedings that he did not move even a single leaf of the aromatic herbs sprinkled with vinegar that carpeted the floor, as a hygienic measure against the contagion of prison fever and the foul atmosphere that was breathed there.</t1014>
<t1015>Above the head of the condemned man, there was a large mirror whose purpose was to concentrate the greatest possible amount of light on his face.</t1015> <t1016>Thousands of unfortunate and wicked people had seen their contorted faces reflected on its smooth surface, minutes before a layer of earth concealed them forever.</t1016> <t1017>There would be no hell comparable to that abominable Room if the surface of a mirror could return the images it reflects, in the same way that the Ocean returns its dead.</t1017> <t1018>Perhaps the condemned man felt the wave of infamy and dishonor that was about to envelop him, or maybe it was chance or a brighter ray of light that moved him to raise his eyes: the fact is that he saw the mirror, and upon seeing it, vivid crimson hues colored his face and his body experienced a violent shudder as if he had just received a powerful electric shock.</t1018>
<t1019>When they turned their gaze away from the mirror, they directed it to the left, where it fell upon two people with such intensity that there wasn't a single spectator in the room who didn't turn their eyes towards them.</t1019>
<t1020>The individuals in question were a young lady, approximately twenty years old, and a gentleman, evidently her father.</t1020> <t1021>What stood out strikingly in the latter was the snow-white color of his hair and a certain indescribable expression of vehemence, not active, but reflective, intimate.</t1021> <t1022>When this expression dominated, he seemed old, but in the moments when it disappeared, for example, when he spoke with his daughter, he was a handsome man who had barely passed the springtime of life.</t1022>
<t1023>Her daughter clung to her arm and pressed against her body, driven by the horror that the scene produced in her and the pity that the accused inspired in her, horror and pity so eloquently portrayed on her forehead and in her eyes, that the spectators, unmoved by the sad fate of the accused, could not see the young woman's state without profound pity.</t1023> <t1024>"Who could they be?" they whispered to each other.</t1024>
<t1025>Jeremías Lapa did not stop asking his neighbor, whose perceptive eyes had not missed the young woman's expression, who those people were; and since everyone had asked the same question, the answer, which was already circulating from mouth to mouth, finally reached his ear.</t1025>
<t1026>—They are witnesses.</t1026>
<t1027>—Of charge?</t1027>
<t1028>—Witnesses against.</t1028>
<t1029>—Against whom?</t1029>
<t1030>—Of the accused.</t1030>
<t1031>The judge, whose gaze had followed the direction taken by all the spectators, turned it away to fix it intently on the unfortunate man whose life was in his hands, at the moment when the Crown prosecutor rose to twist the rope, sharpen the axe, and forge the hammer and nails that would prepare the scaffold.</t1031>
<t1032>III.</t1032>
<t1033>DISAPPOINTMENT</t1033>
<t1034>The Crown Prosecutor stated in his report that the accused, though young in years, was so old in treacherous acts and perfidious practices that it was necessary to end his life.</t1034><t1035>"His dealings and continuous correspondence with the public enemy," he said, "do not date from yesterday, nor the day before, nor from last year, nor from two years ago.</t1035><t1036>From a much earlier date, the accused has been making constant trips between England and France, mysterious trips, the purpose of which he himself has not been able to explain to us satisfactorily.</t1036><t1037>Ah!</t1037><t1038>If Heaven, in its high wisdom, had not condemned the machinations of traitors to eternal failure, the criminal acts of this man would have borne their natural fruits, but Providence, which watches in a special way over the fate of our beloved England, inspired a person, in whose heart fear has no entry and in whose conscience malice has no place, with the fortunate thought of uncovering the sinister plans of the accused, and when he achieved his goal, filled with terror, he hurried to reveal them to the first Secretary of State and to the august Privy Council of His Majesty.</t1038><t1039>Soon you will have the opportunity to meet this patriot, whose conduct has been sublime.</t1039><t1040>He had been an intimate friend of the traitor, but as soon as he discovered his infamies, he decided to sacrifice a friendship, which he could no longer keep in his heart, on the sacred altar of patriotism.</t1040><t1041>If England ever erects statues, as Greece and Rome did in honor of those who sacrificed their deepest affections for the sake of the homeland, there is no doubt that this eminent citizen will have his own.</t1041><t1042>Virtue, as countless poets have affirmed, whose names I will not cite because all my listeners have them on the tip of their tongues, is eminently contagious, and above all, the sacred virtue of patriotism, the love of the homeland.</t1042><t1043>It is not surprising, then, that the high and sublime example of the immaculate and impeccable witness I refer to, whose name honors anyone who pronounces it, was contagious to a servant of the same accused, and inspired in him the holy resolution to search the drawers of the tables and the pockets of his master, to seize or take note of his most secret documents.</t1043><t1044>There will be detractors who sink their teeth into the reputation of this admirable servant, slanderers who will expose the peccadilloes of his past life in the public pillory, but even so, I must protest that his present conduct makes him deserving of all my respect, I must say that he deserves more consideration than my own brothers, more consideration than my own parents.</t1044><t1045>I do not doubt, I cannot doubt that those who listen to me will do the same.</t1045><t1046>The statements of the two named witnesses, together with the documents that will be exhibited in due course, demonstrate as clearly as sunlight that the prisoner possessed numerical relations of His Majesty's military forces, explanatory states of their disposition and preparation, and there is no doubt that these relations, these states, he carried, as he has carried so many others, to an enemy power.</t1046><t1047>I confess that it has not been possible to prove that these relations and these states are in the handwriting of the accused, but that does not matter, it means nothing, and in any case, it will be an aggravating circumstance, since it will highlight the cunning malice of the accused.</t1047><t1048>The evidence goes back five years, clearly demonstrating that the prisoner was already then carrying out infamous and pernicious missions, that he was already selling out the homeland weeks before the first battle between English and American forces was fought.</t1048><t1049>All these reasons will necessarily influence the mind of the Jury, if it is a loyal Jury, as I know it is, if it is a responsible Jury, as I consider it to be, to declare the prisoner guilty, and to rid the world of a traitor.</t1049><t1050>Ah, gentlemen of the jury!</t1050><t1051>As long as there is a head on the prisoner's shoulders, it is not possible for your heads to rest peacefully on the pillows of your beds, it is not possible for the heads of your tender wives to rest peacefully on the pillows of their beds, it is not possible for the little heads of your dear children to rest peacefully on the pillows of their beds.</t1051><t1052>The Crown Prosecutor asks you by the most sacred, by what is most dear to you, by the oath you have taken, by the august and excellent King who governs us, by the homeland, which is our mother, to sentence the prisoner to be hanged, beheaded, and quartered."</t1052>
<t1053>When the Crown prosecutor stopped speaking, the courtroom filled with muffled murmurs.</t1053> <t1054>It seemed as if the air had filled with swarms of blue flies buzzing around the defendant's head, aware of the state in which they would soon find him.</t1054> <t1055>When the buzzing ceased, the impeccable citizen, the sublime patriot cited by the Crown prosecutor, appeared in the witness stand.</t1055>
<t1056>The Attorney General, strictly adhering to his chief's instructions, then examined the patriot.</t1056> <t1057>His name was John Barsad, and he was a gentleman.</t1057> <t1058>The story of his pure and immaculate soul turned out to be the one the Crown prosecutor had succinctly presented in his accusation.</t1058> <t1059>After he had answered the questions directed at him, he would have modestly withdrawn, had the gentleman with the enormous wig and bulky bundles of papers, who was seated a short distance from Mr. Lorry, not expressed a desire to ask him some other questions.</t1059> <t1060>The second wigged man continued to stare at the ceiling.</t1060>
<t1061>Here is, in summary, the interrogation to which the great patriot was subjected by the gentleman with the wig:</t1061>
<t1062>—Have you ever been a spy?</t1062>
<t1063>—Never—replied the citizen indignantly.</t1063>
<t1064>—What do you live on?</t1064>
<t1065>—From my income.</t1065>
<t1066>—What do those incomes consist of?</t1066>
<t1067>—I don't have to give explanations about this matter.</t1067>
<t1068>—Where are your assets located?</t1068>
<t1069>—I don't remember it precisely.</t1069>
<t1070>—Have you inherited?</t1070>
<t1071>—Yes.</t1071>
<t1072>—Whose?</t1072>
<t1073>—From a distant relative.</t1073>
<t1074>—Very far?</t1074>
<t1075>—Enough.</t1075>
<t1076>—Have you ever been prosecuted?</t1076>
<t1077>—Never.</t1077>
<t1078>—Has he not even been in jail for debts?</t1078>
<t1079>—I don't know what that has to do with the matter being debated.</t1079>
<t1080>—Have you been in jail for debts?</t1080>
<t1081>—Again?</t1081>
<t1082>—Answer, please.</t1082>
<t1083>—Yes.</t1083>
<t1084>—How many times?</t1084>
<t1085>—Two or three.</t1085>
<t1086>—Could it be five or six?</t1086>
<t1087>—Maybe.</t1087>
<t1088>—Your profession?</t1088>
<t1089>—Gentleman.</t1089>
<t1090>—Have you ever been kicked?</t1090>
<t1091>—Maybe so.</t1091>
<t1092>—Often?</t1092>
<t1093>—No.</t1093>
<t1094>—Have you ever been kicked out of a house?</t1094>
<t1095>—No.</t1095>
<t1096>—Haven't they kicked him down the stairs?</t1096>
<t1097>—I repeat, no.</t1097> <t1098>On one occasion, I received a few kicks at the top of a staircase and rolled down it, but it was because I wanted to, by my own will, deliberately.</t1098>
<t1099>—On the occasion you refer to, weren't you kicked out for cheating, for making tricks in a dice game?</t1099>
<t1100>—Something like that said the lying drunk who kicked me, but it was false.</t1100>
<t1101>—Do you swear it was false?</t1101>
<t1102>—Without the slightest hesitation.</t1102>
<t1103>—Have you never sought the means to live in the traps of the game?</t1103>
<t1104>—Never.</t1104>
<t1105>—Haven't you even lived off gambling?</t1105>
<t1106>—I have played as all other gentlemen play.</t1106>
<t1107>—Has the prisoner lent you money?</t1107>
<t1108>—Yes.</t1108>
<t1109>—And has he paid for it?</t1109>
<t1110>—No.</t1110>
<t1111>—The friendship that has bound him with the prisoner, in reality a light friendship, was it not one of those we usually call obligatory, that is, a friendship cultivated in stagecoaches, inns, and ships?</t1111>
<t1112>—No.</t1112>
<t1113>—Have you seen the records and lists in the prisoner's possession?</t1113>
<t1114>—Yes.</t1114>
<t1115>—Can you say something more about those lists?</t1115>
<t1116>—No.</t1116>
<t1117>—Do you expect your statement to bring you any advantage or benefit?</t1117>
<t1118>—No.</t1118>
<t1119>—Not even a fate as a government-hired spy?</t1119>
<t1120>—No.</t1120>
<t1121>—Not any other job either?</t1121>
<t1122>No.</t1122>
<t1123>—Do you swear?</t1123>
<t1124>—A thousand and one times.</t1124>
<t1125>—Does it obey motives other than those of patriotism?</t1125>
<t1126>—No.</t1126>
<t1127>The virtuous servant of the prisoner, Rogerio Cly, was called to testify, and he took his oath with great determination.</t1127> <t1128>Four years earlier, he had entered the service of the prisoner, simply and in good faith.</t1128> <t1129>On board the ship that serviced Calais, he asked the prisoner if he needed a servant, and the latter accepted him.</t1129> <t1130>Very shortly after, the prisoner's behavior seemed suspicious to him, and he resolved to spy on him.</t1130> <t1131>During the various trips he made in his company, he saw several times in his master's clothes lists and records similar to those held by the authorities.</t1131> <t1132>He was the one who took some of those lists from a drawer in his master's desk.</t1132> <t1133>He saw that his master showed other identical lists to a French gentleman in Calais and others to other French gentlemen, both in Calais and in Boulogne.</t1133> <t1134>A lover of his country, his conscience rebelled against such dark treacheries and he reported the facts.</t1134> <t1135>Regarding his honesty, he assured that it was so impeccable that no one ever dared to accuse him of stealing a silver teapot, for although there were slanderers who once accused him of stealing a butter dish, upon verification, it turned out it was not silver but silver-plated metal.</t1135> <t1136>He had known the witness who preceded him in the statement for seven or eight years, but they only ever interacted by coincidence.</t1136> <t1137>He did not claim that these were extraordinarily curious coincidences, undoubtedly because it is public and notorious that coincidences are generally so.</t1137>
<t1138>The muffled buzzing of the blue flies was heard for the second time, and the Crown prosecutor called Mr. Maurice Lorry.</t1138>
<t1139>—Are you an employee of Tellson's Bank, Mr. Maurice Lorry?</t1139>
<t1140>—Yes, sir.</t1140>
<t1141>—On the night of a Friday in the month of November of the year one thousand seven hundred seventy-five, did you make a journey from London to Dover by the mail coach?</t1141>
<t1142>—Yes, sir.</t1142>
<t1143>—Were there other travelers in the coach?</t1143>
<t1144>—Yes, sir: two.</t1144>
<t1145>—Did they leave the coach that night, before reaching Dover?</t1145>
<t1146>—Yes, sir.</t1146>
<t1147>—Look at the prisoner, Mr. Lorry, and tell us if he was one of those travelers.</t1147>
<t1148>—I can't say that it was.</t1148>
<t1149>—Does he look like any of your travel companions?</t1149>
<t1150>—The two were so cloaked, the night was so dark, and the three of us kept such secrecy, that it is impossible for me to answer the question.</t1150>
<t1151>—Examine the prisoner more closely, Mr. Lorry.</t1151> <t1152>Picture him cloaked, in the same manner as his travel companions, and tell us if, given his height and build, it is impossible that he was one of the two travelers.</t1152>
<t1153>—It is not impossible.</t1153>
<t1154>—Would you not swear that the defendant was none of them?</t1154>
<t1155>—No.</t1155>
<t1156>—Then you admit that you could be one of them, don't you?</t1156>
<t1157>—I admit the possibility, but... but I remember perfectly that my two travel companions were... and I was too... terribly afraid of thieves, and it seems to me that the defendant is not one to be easily frightened.</t1157>
<t1158>—And have you never seen fake fear... I mean, people who pretend to feel a fear they don't actually feel?</t1158>
<t1159>—No, sir.</t1159>
<t1160>—Please identify the defendant again, Mr. Lorry.</t1160> <t1161>Do you remember seeing him on any occasion?</t1161>
<t1162>—Yes.</t1162>
<t1163>—When and where?</t1163>
<t1164>—Upon my return from France, a few days after the stagecoach incident, I found him in Calais aboard the ship on which I was coming back, and we made the journey together.</t1164>
<t1165>—What time did the prisoner board?</t1165>
<t1166>—Already late at night.</t1166> <t1167>He was the only passenger on the boat, except for us, and he arrived at the last minute.</t1167>
<t1168>—What time could it be?</t1168>
<t1169>—A little past midnight.</t1169>
<t1170>—And you say you arrived last?</t1170>
<t1171>—It so happened that I arrived last, yes, sir.</t1171>
<t1172>—Let's set aside the "coincidences."</t1172> <t1173>He was the only passenger who arrived late at night, wasn't he?</t1173>
<t1174>—Yes, sir.</t1174>
<t1175>—Were you traveling alone, or accompanied, Mr. Lorry?</t1175>
<t1176>—With two companions: a gentleman and a young lady.</t1176> <t1177>Both are here.</t1177>
<t1178>—Indeed: here they are.</t1178> <t1179>Did you speak with the prisoner?</t1179>
<t1180>—Very little.</t1180> <t1181>The weather was stormy, the journey was long and arduous, and I spent it lying on the couch from beach to beach.</t1181>
<t1182>—Miss Manette!</t1182>
<t1183>The young lady, towards whom all eyes had previously turned and towards whom they turned again when she was called, stood up.</t1183> <t1184>At the same time as she did, her father stood up.</t1184>
<t1185>—Examine the prisoner, Miss Manette.</t1185>
<t1186>A thousand times more painful was it for the accused to find himself facing that young, beautiful girl, who looked at him with longing compassion, than to face the curious gazes of the crowds that filled the room.</t1186> <t1187>Without blinking, without a single muscle in his face altering, he endured the terrible accusation of the Crown prosecutor; the statements of the prosecution witnesses did not manage to change his expression, but seeing from the edge of the grave the look, not of curiosity, but of pity, from the girl, all his nerve, which was considerable, was not enough to restrain the agitation in his chest, and in the desperate efforts made to remain calm, his lips turned pale, all the blood flowed back to his heart.</t1187>
<t1188>—Did you know the prisoner, Miss Manette?</t1188>
<t1189>—Yes, sir.</t1189>
<t1190>—Where did you meet him?</t1190>
<t1191>—Aboard the ship they mentioned earlier and on the same occasion.</t1191>
<t1192>—Are you the young lady mentioned by Mr. Lorry?</t1192>
<t1193>—Unfortunately, sir, it is I!</t1193>
<t1194>The tones of compassion that the girl managed to infuse into her voice did not soften that of the judge, who replied with a certain severity:</t1194>
<t1195>—The witness shall answer the questions asked without making observations or comments...</t1195> <t1196>Miss Manette, did you have any conversation with the prisoner during the crossing of the Channel?</t1196>
<t1197>—Yes, sir.</t1197>
<t1198>—Refer her.</t1198>
<t1199>Amidst an imposing silence, the girl began with a weak voice:</t1199>
<t1200>—When that gentleman came on board...</t1200>
<t1201>—Are you referring to the prisoner?—asked the judge, frowning.</t1201>
<t1202>—Yes, sir.</t1202>
<t1203>—Well, when you have to name him, call him the prisoner.</t1203>
<t1204>—When the prisoner came on board, he noticed that my father was very fatigued and in a very delicate state of health.</t1204> <t1205>Such was my father's exhaustion that, fearing the lack of air might harm him, I prepared a bed for him on the deck, next to the cabin stairs, and I sat beside him to attend to him.</t1205> <t1206>There were only four passengers.</t1206> <t1207>The prisoner was so kind that, after asking me to excuse his boldness, he showed me how to place my father sheltered from the air and the damp, something I had not known how to do.</t1207> <t1208>He lavished my father with attentions and kindnesses that I cannot forget, and I am sure he did so from the heart.</t1208> <t1209>This is how we began to talk.</t1209>
<t1210>—Allow me to interrupt you.</t1210> <t1211>Did you arrive alone on board?</t1211>
<t1212>—No, sir.</t1212>
<t1213>—How many were accompanying you?</t1213>
<t1214>—Two French gentlemen.</t1214>
<t1215>—What were you discussing with the prisoner?</t1215>
<t1216>—They spoke with the prisoner until the last moment.</t1216> <t1217>When the ship was weighing anchor, they bid him farewell and jumped into their boat.</t1217>
<t1218>—Did they exchange among themselves any papers similar to these?</t1218>
<t1219>—They exchanged some papers, but I don't know how or what they were.</t1219>
<t1220>—Similar to these in size and shape?</t1220>
<t1221>—It is possible, but I cannot assure it, although I was very close to the place where they were talking.</t1221> <t1222>The night was very dark and the prisoner and the French gentlemen positioned themselves at the top of the chamber stairs, under the hanging lantern.</t1222> <t1223>They, however, held the conversation in such a low voice that I did not hear a word.</t1223> <t1224>I did see, though, that they were reading papers, and nothing more.</t1224>
<t1225>—Repeat to us the conversation you had with the prisoner, Miss Manette.</t1225>
<t1226>—The prisoner was very frank with me... he placed great trust in me... he was very kind, very good... he treated my father with tender care... and I wouldn't want—finished the young woman, in a sea of tears—I wouldn't want to repay his favors with statements that might harm him.</t1226>
<t1227>The blue horseflies started buzzing again.</t1227>
<t1228>—Miss Manette—replied the prosecutor,—if the prisoner does not realize that you are giving the testimony that it is your duty to give... that you are obliged to give... that you cannot be excused from giving, against your will and with great reluctance, it must be admitted that he is blind.</t1228> <t1229>Please continue.</t1229>
<t1230>—He told me that his journey was motivated by matters of a highly delicate and compromising nature, matters that might possibly cause serious conflicts between different peoples, and for this reason, he was traveling under an assumed name.</t1230> <t1231>He told me that these matters had taken him to France a few days earlier, and that probably, for a more or less long period, they would oblige him to make frequent trips between England and France.</t1231>
<t1232>—Did he speak of America, Miss Manette?</t1232> <t1233>Please be kind enough to specify in detail.</t1233>
<t1234>—He tried to explain to me the causes that led to the conflict, and he told me that, in his opinion, the wrong and the injustice were on the side of England.</t1234> <t1235>He added, in a humorous tone, that perhaps George Washington was destined to achieve as high a renown in history as George III.</t1235> <t1236>But in all this there was not a shadow of malice: he said it laughing and to pass the time.</t1236>
<t1237>The Crown Prosecutor stated that he considered it necessary to question the young lady's father, Dr. Manette.</t1237>
<t1238>—Look at the prisoner, Dr. Manette: do you remember seeing him before?</t1238>
<t1239>—Only once.</t1239> <t1240>It was three or three and a half years ago that he visited me at my house in London.</t1240>
<t1241>—Can you tell us if he was your travel companion during the crossing of the Canal, or repeat the conversation you had with your daughter?</t1241>
<t1242>—Neither one nor the other, sir.</t1242>
<t1243>—Are there any particular and special reasons that make it impossible for you to do what is being asked?</t1243>
<t1244>—They exist—replied the doctor in a very low voice.</t1244>
<t1245>—Are these the misfortunes of having suffered a long captivity in your homeland, without being condemned, and even without being accused?</t1245>
<t1246>With a tone that penetrated to the depths of the hearts of all those present, he replied:</t1246>
<t1247>—An eternal captivity!</t1247>
<t1248>—Had you recently regained your freedom when the trip I am referring to took place?</t1248>
<t1249>—That's what they tell me.</t1249>
<t1250>—Don't you remember?</t1250>
<t1251>—I don't remember anything.</t1251> <t1252>My brain was a deep night for some time... I can't say how long... from when I was making shoes in my cell until I found myself in London in the company of my dear daughter.</t1252> <t1253>I got used to her presence... I don't know how... I have no memory of the process... and finally, the merciful God saw fit to restore my faculties.</t1253>
<t1254>The Crown prosecutor concluded the questioning, and the father and daughter sat down again.</t1254>
<t1255>A singular incident occurred at this point.</t1255> <t1256>The object of the proceedings, the goal pursued in the process, was to demonstrate that the accused, in the company of another traitorous accomplice whose identity was a mystery until then, travelers, on the night of a Friday in the month of November five years ago, had dismounted during the journey in the mail coach from London to Dover, with the aim of misleading, at a place where they did not intend to stay, from where they retraced twelve or more miles to reach a stronghold with an arsenal, where they gathered the data they were seeking.</t1256> <t1257>A witness declared that on the indicated day and time, he had seen the prisoner in the dining room of a hotel in the mentioned stronghold and arsenal, waiting for another person.</t1257> <t1258>The defendant's defense attorney was subjecting the witness to an interrogation as rigid as it was skillful, with no other result than ensuring that he had never, neither before nor after the indicated occasion, seen the prisoner, when the bewigged gentleman, who had been staring at the ceiling of the courtroom since the beginning of the trial, wrote two or three words on a small piece of paper, twisted it, and then threw it to the defense attorney.</t1258> <t1259>After reading the small piece of paper, the defense attorney looked at the prisoner with extraordinary attention and curiosity.</t1259>
<t1260>—Do you say that you have absolute certainty that it was the prisoner?—asked the witness.</t1260>
<t1261>—Absolutely.</t1261>
<t1262>—Have you never seen anyone who resembles the prisoner?</t1262>
<t1263>—To no one who resembles them so much that it could lead to a mistake.</t1263>
<t1264>—Take a good look at that gentleman,—he replied, pointing to the one who had just thrown him the note—and then, take a good look at the prisoner.</t1264> <t1265>What do you say?</t1265> <t1266>Isn't it true that they look quite alike?</t1266>
<t1267>However, despite the negligence and untidiness of the gentleman with the little paper, there was a rather remarkable resemblance between him and the prisoner, enough to surprise not only the witness but also everyone present in the courtroom.</t1267> <t1268>The president of the tribunal requested the aforementioned gentleman with the little paper to remove his wig, and the resemblance became much more notable.</t1268> <t1269>The president asked Mr. Stryver, who was the defense attorney, if they were to prosecute Mr. Carton, the name of the gentleman with the little paper, for the crime of treason, to which the defense attorney replied no, but that he wished to ask the witness if he believed that what had happened once could not happen again, if he would have dared to speak with such certainty and confidence if he had previously seen that palpable example of his temerity, if the sight of a person who so closely resembled the prisoner would not have been a severe blow to his confidence, etc., etc.</t1269> <t1270>The result of this incident was to annihilate the witness, destroy the effect of his testimony, and strip all value from his statements.</t1270>
<t1271>The good Jeremiah Lapa, who was following the course of the trial without missing a word or gesture, had to listen as the defense turned the tables on the prosecutor and the witnesses who had served the Jury, saying that the exalted, the sublime patriot Barsad, was a mercenary spy, a vile traitor, a blood trafficker who knew neither decorum nor shame, the blackest-souled reptile that had existed in the world since the accursed Judas, to whom he bore a physical and moral resemblance, dishonored it with his presence.</t1271><t1272>He asserted that the mirror of a servant, the innocent Cly, was a friend and accomplice of Barsad, and certainly worthy of being so, that the ever-watchful eyes of those miserable forgers and perjurers had resolved to turn the prisoner into a victim of their greed, taking advantage of the fact that he, being of French origin, made frequent trips between England and France for family matters he could not explain, and that the prisoner would not explain, even if his silence cost him his life, because high considerations forbade him.</t1272><t1273>He demonstrated that the statements made by Miss Manette, whose anguish in making them everyone had had the opportunity to appreciate, were of no importance, and were nothing more than innocent gallantries, very natural for a young man who encounters a charming girl on a journey, except for the part concerning George Washington, which in his opinion was so extravagant that it could only be considered a wildly inappropriate joke.</t1273><t1274>He added that Justice would show palpable weakness if it persisted in the idea of pursuing a sterile populism by exploiting low antipathies and national fears that the Crown prosecutor had exploited in his report, which, in truth, had no more foundation than the meanness and vileness of a statement whose bad faith was glaringly obvious, a statement made with the deliberate intention of distorting the facts, a statement that tends to make Justice, to our shame, add a most lamentable error to the endless series of those it has committed.</t1274>
<t1275>The president, as if what the defender had just expressed was not an exact expression of the truth, interrupted the speaker with a grim face, to say, with a grave demeanor, that it was impossible for him to continue occupying his elevated seat if he was forced to tolerate such unpleasant allusions.</t1275>
<t1276>The defense attorney questioned the few exculpatory witnesses, and subsequently, the audience had to admire the efforts made by the Crown prosecutor to turn inside out the case that the former had crafted for the Jury.</t1276> <t1277>The most striking part of his speech was to assert a thousand times over that the heroic Barsad and Cly were a thousand times more virtuous than initially stated, and the prisoner a thousand times more criminal.</t1277> <t1278>In his final report, the president went over and over the case crafted by the prosecutor and tried to undo the seams of the one presented by the defense attorney, showing a clear tendency to prepare the prisoner's shroud with both.</t1278>
<t1279>The Jury withdrew to deliberate, and the large blue flies once again made their unpleasant buzzing heard.</t1279>
<t1280>The movement, the general murmurs, the anticipation that had taken hold of all the witnesses of the scene, did not cause Mr. Carton, who continued to sit and stare at the ceiling, to change his posture or position.</t1280> <t1281>Meanwhile, his friend Mr. Stryver, gathering the papers in front of him, conversed with the people closest to him and from time to time cast anxious glances at the Jury, while all the spectators moved about more or less, sometimes separating, sometimes coming together again, while even the president left his seat to walk around the platform, giving reason for those present to suspect that his state of mind was far from calm, Mr. Carton remained slouched in his seat, with his wig half askew, hands in his pockets, seemingly indifferent to everything and everyone, his eyes fixed on the ceiling as they had been all day.</t1281>
<t1282>Nevertheless, Mr. Carton noticed more details of the scene unfolding before his eyes than it seemed at first glance.</t1282> <t1283>Proof of this is that, when Miss Manette, overwhelmed by so many emotions, fainted into her father's arms, it was Carton who noticed it first and was the first to come to her aid, saying:</t1283>
<t1284>—Guard! </t1284> <t1285>Attend to that young lady...</t1285> <t1286>Help the gentleman to get her out of the room...</t1286> <t1287>Don't you see she's about to faint?</t1287>
<t1288>Everyone was moved to compassion upon seeing the young lady being taken out of the room, and there was no one who did not extend all their sympathies to the father.</t1288> <t1289>The scene, which could not help but remind him of the endless years of his undeserved imprisonment, deeply affected him.</t1289> <t1290>A good proof of this was the intense inner agitation that the interrogation caused him, an agitation that did not go unnoticed by anyone.</t1290>
<t1291>Moments later, the Jury appeared, and through its president, stated that, not having reached an agreement, they wished to withdraw again.</t1291>
<t1292>The president of the Court, whose imagination was filled, if some malicious people are not mistaken, by the portrait of George Washington, expressed some surprise upon learning that the Jury had not reached an agreement, but agreed to let them retire again to deliberate, and, undoubtedly to imitate their conduct, he also withdrew.</t1292> <t1293>The hearing had lasted all day and it was necessary to light the lamps in the Courtroom.</t1293> <t1294>Rumors circulated that the Jury's deliberations would be long, in view of which, the spectators began to file out to get some refreshments, and the defendant was taken to the most secluded part of the bar, where he took a seat.</t1294>
<t1295>Mr. Lorry, who had gone out accompanying Miss Manette and her father, reappeared again and signaled to Jeremiah Lapa.</t1295>
<t1296>—If you want to have something, Jeremiah, you can do so, but don't stray too far from here.</t1296> <t1297>It's essential that when the Jury enters, you are by my side, as the Bank is eagerly awaiting the news of the verdict.</t1297> <t1298>You are the fastest messenger I know and will be able to reach the Temple Court much sooner than I can.</t1298>
<t1299>Lapa made a very graceful bow, I do not know whether it was due to the trust that Mr. Lorry placed in him, or because of the shilling he had just put in his hands.</t1299>
<t1300>At that point, Mr. Carton left his seat and touched Lorry on the shoulder.</t1300>
<t1301>—How is the young lady?—he asked.</t1301>
<t1302>—Terribly distressed, but her father tries to console her, and she seems to be better than before leaving the room.</t1302>
<t1303>—I am going to tell the prisoner.</t1303> <t1304>A gentleman as respectable as you should not speak to him in public.</t1304>
<t1305>Lorry blushed intensely, undoubtedly because he saw that his thoughts at that moment had been read, and Carton started walking towards the bar.</t1305> <t1306>It goes without saying that Jeremiah Lapa followed him with all his eyes, with all his ears, and with all the spikes that adorned his scalp.</t1306>
<t1307>—Mr. Darnay—called Carton.</t1307>
<t1308>The prisoner stood up immediately.</t1308>
<t1309>—It is natural that you wish to have news of the witness Miss Manette.</t1309> <t1310>She is better: the worst of her agitation has passed.</t1310>
<t1311>—With all my soul, I regret having been the cause of it.</t1311> <t1312>Would you be so kind as to convey it to her on my behalf?</t1312>
<t1313>—I will do it, if you wish.</t1313>
<t1314>Carton's attitude was so indifferent that it bordered on insolent.</t1314>
<t1315>—I desire it very much, and I give you my most cordial thanks—replied the prisoner.</t1315>
<t1316>—What are you waiting for, Mr. Darnay?—asked Carton, half turned away from his interlocutor.</t1316>
<t1317>—The worst.</t1317>
<t1318>—You are doing well, since you expect what will probably happen.</t1318> <t1319>However, the new withdrawal of the Jury allows for some hope.</t1319>
<t1320>Jeremías Lapa walked away without hearing more.</t1320> <t1321>There, beneath the large mirror that reflected both faces, remained the two men, so similar in features and so dissimilar in manners and attitude.</t1321>
<t1322>An hour and a half more passed slowly, heavily, eternally.</t1322> <t1323>The bank messenger, after having his snack, had sat down and fallen asleep on a bench, when he was enveloped by the human tide that clamored as it once again invaded the Hall.</t1323>
<t1324>—Jeremiah... Jeremiah!—shouted Mr. Lorry, trying to get closer to the door.</t1324>
<t1325>—Here I am, sir... but I have to elbow my way through if I want to get back in!</t1325>
<t1326>Lorry extended an arm and handed him a paper.</t1326>
<t1327>—Flying...! Do you have it already?</t1327>
<t1328>—Yes, sir.</t1328>
<t1329>On the paper, there was a single word written: "acquitted".</t1329>
<t1330>—If this time you had written "Resurrected,"—murmured Lapa as he turned around—I would already know what all this means.</t1330>
<t1331>It was the only thing he could say, or think, or do, until he found himself outside the Old Bailey, as the crowds poured out like an overflowing torrent, sweeping away and dragging along everything in their path.</t1331> <t1332>The murmurs were like the loud buzzing of bluebottle flies that disperse in disappointment upon finding themselves deprived of the rotten scraps they expected to find.</t1332>
<t1333>IV.</t1333>
<t1334>CONGRATULATIONS</t1334>
<t1335>The last remnants of the human stew that had simmered all day in the courtroom were trickling through the dirty and gloomy corridors of the courthouse building, when Doctor Manette, Lucia, his daughter, Mr. Lorry, the defense lawyer, and the defense attorney formed a group around Charles Darnay, who had been released moments before, congratulating and celebrating him for having almost miraculously escaped death.</t1335>
<t1336>The light was scarce, but even in the brightness of a summer sun, it would have been very difficult to recognize in the serene and intelligent face and upright body of the doctor the cobbler from the garret in Paris.</t1336> <t1337>Nevertheless, it was impossible to see him once without feeling an irresistible itch to examine him again, even if the observer had not had the chance to hear the gloomy rhythm of his deep voice, nor noticed the kind of cloud that overshadowed his countenance for no apparent reason.</t1337> <t1338>And it was because he did not need external causes to evoke in his soul, as had happened in the Courtroom during the hearing, painful echoes of his past agonies; these arose spontaneously, and when they did, they enveloped him in something like a funeral veil that could not be seen by those who were unaware of his sad story.</t1338>
<t1339>Only his daughter managed to drive away the dark memories that persistently haunted his mind.</t1339> <t1340>Lucía was the golden thread that connected him to a past before his miseries and to a present after his sorrows.</t1340> <t1341>The sweet music of her voice, the joy reflected in her pretty face, the touch of her hand, almost always had a decisive beneficial influence on him, and I say almost always, because there had been occasions, although not many, when the girl's power had crashed against his sadness.</t1341> <t1342>Lucía harbored the sweet hope that those cases would not be repeated.</t1342>
<t1343>Darnay had savored the pleasure of kissing the young woman's hand, and after expressing his gratitude with fervent phrases, he turned to his defender, Mr. Stryver, to whom he warmly gave thanks.</t1343> <t1344>Stryver, a man who was barely thirty years old, although he looked fifty, robust, stout, red-faced, boastful, and impervious to all kinds of delicate impulses, possessed the secret of adapting himself, morally and physically, to all kinds of companies and conversations, and it was to be supposed that just as he adapted to companies and conversations, he knew how to adapt to the thousand and one trivialities related to life.</t1344>
<t1345>He was still wearing the robe and the wig.</t1345> <t1346>When he went to respond to his client, he spun on his heels in a way that excluded the innocent Mr. Lorry from the group, and said:</t1346>
<t1347>—I infinitely celebrate having gotten you out of the ordeal with honor, Mr. Darnay.</t1347> <t1348>You have been the victim of an infamous persecution, brutally infamous, but one that could very well have had the outcome your enemies sought.</t1348>
<t1349>"The obligations I have contracted with you will never expire," replied the young man, warmly shaking the lawyer's hand.</t1349>
<t1350>—I have done for you as much as I could, Mr. Darnay, and I have the presumption to believe that I can do as much as any other man could.</t1350>
<t1351>The last words required a mandatory response, which any of those in the group could and should give.</t1351> <t1352>Mr. Lorry gave it, probably out of interest, that is, to be readmitted into the group.</t1352>
<t1353>—More, much more than any other man—he said.</t1353>
<t1354>—Do you really think so?—asked Stryver.</t1354><t1355>—Absolutely.</t1355> <t1356>You have witnessed the entire trial, and you have reasons to know what you are saying.</t1356> <t1357>Besides, you are a businessman.</t1357>
<t1358>—And in that capacity—replied Lorry, whom the lawyer had brought into the group in the same manner as he had previously excluded him—in my capacity as such, I request Dr. Manette to bring this conference to an end, so that we may each retire to our respective homes.</t1358> <t1359>Miss Lucie is not feeling well, Mr. Darnay has had a terrible day, and we are all exhausted.</t1359>
<t1360>—Speak for yourself, Mr. Lorry, speak for yourself—said the lawyer.</t1360><t1361>—I have a night of continuous work ahead of me.</t1361>
<t1362>—I speak for myself—replied Lorry—and for Mr. Darnay, and for Miss Lucie and... Don't you think, Miss Lucie, that I can speak for all of us?—he asked, addressing the young woman, but looking at the same time at her father.</t1362>
<t1363>The old man's face took on an indefinable expression as he directed an intense look at Darnay.</t1363> <t1364>Deep wrinkles appeared on the former's forehead, his lips tightened, and little by little his gaze expressed repugnance, suspicion, and fear.</t1364>
<t1365>—My father!—she whispered in his ear, while squeezing his hand.</t1365>
<t1366>The old man, whose face gradually lit up, turned towards his daughter.</t1366>
<t1367>—Shall we go home, my father?—replied the girl.</t1367>
<t1368>The doctor let out a very deep and very prolonged sigh, and replied:</t1368>
<t1369>—Yes.</t1369>
<t1370>The prisoner's friends, whom he had made believe that he would not be released that night, had already dispersed.</t1370> <t1371>Almost all the lights that illuminated the narrow corridors of the sinister building, which the next morning would be filled again with people eager for emotions, had been turned off.</t1371> <t1372>The defense attorney was the first to leave to go change clothes, and Lucie Manette called a carriage, said goodbye to Mr. Lorry and Darnay, and had herself driven home, accompanying her father.</t1372>
<t1373>Another person, who had not been part of the group nor exchanged a word with any of its members, detached themselves from the wall against which they had been leaning and, as soon as the carriage was out of sight, silently approached Lorry and Darnay like a shadow, who had remained talking on the sidewalk.</t1373>
<t1374>—Hello, Mr. Lorry!—he said.</t1374><t1375>—It seems that business men now dare to speak with Darnay, eh?</t1375> <t1376>What conflicts business causes!</t1376> <t1377>You would laugh, Darnay, if you knew the struggles that business men have to endure between their natural impulses and the demands of their position.</t1377>
<t1378>—You made that same remark before, Mr. Carton—replied Lorry, blushing to the whites of his eyes.</t1378><t1379>—We, the businessmen, those who serve a house, are not masters of ourselves.</t1379> <t1380>More than in ourselves, we have to think about the house.</t1380>
<t1381>—I know, I know, Mr. Lorry!—replied Carton carelessly.</t1381><t1382>—I would be sorry if you were upset.</t1382> <t1383>I know that you are not worse than the others, and I would even dare to say that you are much better.</t1383>
<t1384>—To tell the truth, sir, I fail to understand your interference.</t1384> <t1385>Forgive me if, taking advantage of my age, I speak to you with perhaps excessive frankness, but I don't see that you have anything to do with our affairs.</t1385>
<t1386>—Matters! Good heavens, sir!</t1386> <t1387>I have no matters.</t1387>
<t1388>—It's a shame that you don't have them.</t1388>
<t1389>—Agreed.</t1389>
<t1390>—Because if I had them, I would pay them some attention.</t1390>
<t1391>—No, my friend, no!</t1391> <t1392>Rest assured that I would not lend them any!</t1392>
<t1393>—All right, sir!—exclaimed Lorry, filled with indignation at the indifference of his interlocutor.</t1393><t1394>—Say what you will, it is very good and very respectable to have business, and if on certain occasions business imposes silence, restrictions, and impediments, those who, like Mr. Darnay, are generous gentlemen understand it... Mr. Darnay... good night.</t1394><t1395>I congratulate you with all the effusion of my soul and wish you a prosperous and happy life... Coachman!</t1395>
<t1396>A little uncomfortable with himself, and certainly more with his interlocutor, Mr. Lorry stormed into the carriage and had himself driven to Tellson's Bank.</t1396> <t1397>Carton, who smelled of wine and whose strong suit, judging by appearances, was not sobriety, burst into laughter and turned to Darnay.</t1397>
<t1398>—Strange whims chance has, Mr. Darnay!—exclaimed Carton.</t1398><t1399>—Could you have supposed that tonight you would be here, treading the street stones, in the company of your alter ego?</t1399>
<t1400>—How could I have supposed it, if even the fact of belonging to this world seems like a dream to me?—replied Darnay.</t1400>
<t1401>—It does not surprise me, after how close it was to the other one.</t1401> <t1402>I notice a certain weakness in your voice, Mr. Darnay.</t1402>
<t1403>—It's just that I'm beginning to believe that I feel weak, Mr. Carton.</t1403>
<t1404>—Why don't you eat, then?</t1404> <t1405>I already ate, while those drones were agreeing on the world in which you would live.</t1405> <t1406>I'm going to accompany you to the nearest tavern where you can eat whatever you like.</t1406>
<t1407>Passing without further ceremonies his arm through Darnay's, Carton started walking towards Fleet Street, soon ending up in a tavern.</t1407> <t1408>The attendant accompanied the newcomers to a reserved little room, where Darnay regained his strength.</t1408> <t1409>Carton, seated at the same table across from Darnay, had a bottle of wine served to him.</t1409>
<t1410>—Are you convincing yourself that you still belong to this earthly world, Darnay?—asked Carton.</t1410>
<t1411>—I can barely grasp the time and place, but I confess that I have almost been convinced of what you say.</t1411>
<t1412>—And he must have convinced himself of it with immense satisfaction!—exclaimed Carton with a certain tone of bitterness, filling the glass again, which was certainly one of the largest.</t1412><t1413>—As for me, I can say that my greatest desire would be to forget that I am a part of him.</t1413> <t1414>Neither does the world have anything good for me... except for wine, nor do I have anything good for the world.</t1414> <t1415>In this particular matter, we are quite alike, we resemble each other quite a bit...</t1415> <t1416>Of course, I am starting to believe that you and I also resemble each other in everything, don't we?</t1416>
<t1417>Carlos Darnay, still under the influence of the day's emotions, took quite a while to respond, simply because he didn't know what answer to give to his interlocutor's extravagant words.</t1417> <t1418>When he did, he showed perfect agreement.</t1418>
<t1419>—Now that you have honored the meal, Mr. Darnay, why don't you raise a glass? Why don't you make a toast?</t1419>
<t1420>—Raise the glass? In honor of whom?</t1420>
<t1421>—In honor and for the health of the person whose name you have on the tip of your tongue.</t1421> <t1422>You must have it, you do have it, I would swear that I am not mistaken.</t1422>
<t1423>—I toast, then, to Miss Manette!</t1423>
<t1424>—To the health of Miss Manette!</t1424>
<t1425>Fixing an insolent gaze on Darnay while downing the contents of his glass, Carton smashed his against the wall after drinking, where it shattered into pieces.</t1425> <t1426>He then rang the bell and asked for another.</t1426>
<t1427>—She is a charming girl, in whose company it would be delightful to take a carriage ride, wouldn't it?—he asked, filling the glass that had just been brought to him with wine.</t1427>
<t1428>—Yes—answered Darnay curtly, with a slight frown.</t1428>
<t1429>—Worthy of compassion and of having true madness done for her.</t1429> <t1430>How is she feeling?</t1430> <t1431>Indeed, it is worth the risk of being condemned to death in exchange for becoming the object of her sympathies and compassion: what do you say, Darnay?</t1431>
<t1432>The questioned person remained silent.</t1432>
<t1433>—She was extremely pleased to hear the message that you sent her through me.</t1433> <t1434>She didn't tell me, but I suppose so.</t1434>
<t1435>The allusion was a way of reminding Darnay.</t1435> <t1436>He remembered that his unpleasant companion had rendered him a service on that fateful day and thanked him, steering the conversation towards that incident.</t1436>
<t1437>—I neither need your thanks nor deserve them—replied Carton with cold indifference.</t1437><t1438>—Firstly, I didn't know what to do, and secondly, I don't know why I did what I did.</t1438> <t1439>Will you allow me to ask you a question, Mr. Darnay?</t1439>
<t1440>—As many as you like, the favors you have done for me give you that right.</t1440>
<t1441>—Do you think I like him?</t1441>
<t1442>—The truth is... Mr. Carton...—replied Darnay, completely bewildered,—it never occurred to me to ask myself that question.</t1442>
<t1443>—Do it yourself now.</t1443>
<t1444>—As if I deserved any sympathy from you, you behaved, but if I have to say what I feel, I think I don't deserve it.</t1444>
<t1445>—And I believe the same as you—observed Carton.</t1445><t1446>—I am beginning to form an excellent opinion of your intelligence.</t1446>
<t1447>—Which should not be an obstacle—replied Darnay, ringing the bell—for me to remain deeply grateful to you and for us to part without mutual ill will.</t1447>
<t1448>—Of course—replied Carton.</t1448><t1449>—Are you saying that you are grateful to me?</t1449>
<t1450>—I say it, and so it is.</t1450>
<t1451>—Then, waiter, bring me another pint of this same wine, and wake me up tomorrow at ten.</t1451>
<t1452>After paying the bill, Darnay stood up, said good night, and headed towards the door.</t1452> <t1453>Carton, without responding to the good night, also stood up, looked angrily at the one who was leaving, and said:</t1453>
<t1454>—Two words, Mr. Darnay, do you think I am drunk?</t1454>
<t1455>—I believe you have drunk a lot, Mr. Carton.</t1455>
<t1456>—Do you just believe it?</t1456> <t1457>You know perfectly well that I have been drinking.</t1457>
<t1458>—Since you insist, I will say that, indeed, I know you have been drinking.</t1458>
<t1459>—In that case, perhaps you also know why I have been drinking.</t1459> <t1460>I am a disillusioned, a disappointed man.</t1460> <t1461>I do not care about the fate of any man on earth, nor does any man on earth even remember my existence.</t1461>
<t1462>—Which remains a misfortune.</t1462> <t1463>You should have put your talent to better use.</t1463>
<t1464>—You may be right, and you may be sadly mistaken.</t1464> <t1465>Do not be conceited, however, my friend, for you do not know what the future holds for you...</t1465> <t1466>Good night!</t1466>
<t1467>When he was alone, that singular man took the candlestick, approached a mirror hanging on the wall, and meticulously and thoroughly examined the image reflected on its smooth surface.</t1467>
<t1468>—Do you find that man likable?—he murmured, as if directing the question to his own reflection.</t1468><t1469>—Why should you find a man who resembles you likable?</t1469> <t1470>Do you have anything that could please anyone?</t1470> <t1471>You know very well that you don't.</t1471> <t1472>I can't understand the reason for the change...</t1472> <t1473>Damned be you!...</t1473> <t1474>And indeed, the man who tells you what you could have been and what you really are deserves sympathy! Come on!...</t1474> <t1475>Say it once and for all, and with honesty!</t1475> <t1476>You despise that individual!</t1476>
<t1477>As if the wine were a fountain of solace for him, in very few minutes he made the pint of wine pass into his stomach and fell asleep at the same table, his head resting on his arms.</t1477>
<t1478>V.</t1478>
<t1479>THE JACKAL</t1479>
<t1480>In those times, universal worship was rendered to the bottle.</t1480> <t1481>If I were to specify and detail here the amount of wine and punch that a man could consume in the course of a night, without his reputation as a perfect gentleman suffering the slightest detriment, I would surely be deemed a ridiculous exaggerator by the readers.</t1481> <t1482>Men drank a lot, and certainly the luminaries of the forum and the notabilities in any other branch of human knowledge were no exception to the rule, as science has never been a barrier raised between its possessor and the altars of Bacchus.</t1482> <t1483>It is therefore not surprising that Mr. Stryver, a lawyer advancing with giant strides in his lucrative profession, rendered as constant worship to the bottle as the driest sponges in the community of pettifoggers.</t1483>
<t1484>Favorite at the Old Bailey and indispensable at the court called Sessions, Stryver separated the steps of the ladder with his foot as he left them behind.</t1484> <t1485>Every day, in one court or another, Stryver's red face emerged from among a layer of wigs, similar to the sunflower that raises its head above a bed of bright flowers.</t1485>
<t1486>They had observed in the forum that Stryver, at the beginning of his career, although he was a man with a loose tongue, unscrupulous, willing to do anything, bold and insolent, lacked the ability to extract the essence, the core of reports and testimonial evidence, which is so indispensable to any good lawyer, but later on, he made marvelous progress in this particular area.</t1486> <t1487>The more he worked, the more easily he reached the heart, the marrow of the matters, it being noteworthy that, even though he had the habit of spending sleepless nights emptying bottles in the company of Carton, the points he had to address the next morning neither faded from his mind nor became obscured.</t1487>
<t1488>Sydney Carton, the laziest and most idle specimen of humanity, was Stryver's most powerful ally.</t1488> <t1489>On the liquid that the two of them consumed, a three-deck ship could have perfectly floated.</t1489> <t1490>Both led the same life, both extended their orgies until dawn, and more than once Carton was seen, with the sun already high, heading with unsteady steps to his home or to the courtroom.</t1490> <t1491>There were no shortage of malicious people who claimed that Carton, if he was not and would never become a lion, was instead an excellent tiger, and that, in this capacity, he rendered invaluable services to his friend Stryver.</t1491>
<t1492>—Ten o'clock, sir—said the tavern keeper whom Carton had instructed to wake him.</t1492><t1493>—Ten o'clock at night.</t1493>
<t1494>—What is happening?</t1494>
<t1495>—It's ten o'clock, sir.</t1495>
<t1496>—And what? Ten o'clock at night?</t1496>
<t1497>—Yes, sir.</t1497> <t1498>You asked me to wake you up at that time.</t1498>
<t1499>—Ah, yes!</t1499> <t1500>Now I remember!</t1500> <t1501>Alright.</t1501>
<t1502>Not without trying to sleep again, attempts that the innkeeper thwarted by constantly stoking the fire and making noise, Carton finally got up and went out.</t1502> <t1503>After he had cleared his head by taking a regular walk, he headed to Stryver's office.</t1503>
<t1504>The official of Stryver, who never attended the conferences he held with Carton, had left, and as a result, it was Stryver himself who had to open the door to the visitor.</t1504> <t1505>He was in a robe and slippers, and his eyes shone between two purplish circles similar to those that characterize all who live or have lived a dissipated life.</t1505>
<t1506>—You're a little late, Carton—said Stryver.</t1506>
<t1507>—More or less at the usual time, maybe fifteen minutes later.</t1507>
<t1508>Both entered the office, a not very large room, crowded with books and papers.</t1508> <t1509>A delightful fire was burning in it.</t1509> <t1510>On the work table, a teapot was steaming among piles of papers and bottles of rum, brandy, and wine, and among lumps of sugar and lemons.</t1510>
<t1511>—I see that you have already finished your usual bottle, Carton.</t1511>
<t1512>—Tonight there were two.</t1512> <t1513>I was eating with my client today... or watching him eat, for that matter, it's the same thing.</t1513>
<t1514>—You gave the matter a truly unique twist, Carton, by drawing my attention to the identification of the defendant.</t1514> <t1515>How on earth did such a thing occur to you?</t1515>
<t1516>—Bah!</t1516> <t1517>I saw that he was a handsome young man, very good-looking, and I thought that I could have been like that, had luck favored me a little more.</t1517>
<t1518>Stryver burst into laughter.</t1518>
<t1519>—Luck must be summoned by working, my friend, so... let's get to work!</t1519>
<t1520>With a more than moderately sullen face, the jackal quickly removed his clothes, entered the adjoining room, and soon came out with a bucket of water, a basin, and one or two towels.</t1520> <t1521>He soaked the towels in cold water, wrapped them around his head, sat down in front of the table, and said:</t1521>
<t1522>—We can begin now.</t1522>
<t1523>—We don't have much work tonight, Carton.</t1523>
<t1524>—How much?</t1524>
<t1525>—Two protocols.</t1525>
<t1526>—Give me the worst one first.</t1526>
<t1527>—Here are the two... Let's get to work!</t1527>
<t1528>The lion of the forum lounged on a sofa while the jackal took a chair.</t1528> <t1529>On the table, placed between the two, there were bottles and glasses.</t1529> <t1530>Both of them resorted to them frequently but in different ways: the lion drank, mostly absorbed or at most glancing indifferently at some unimportant document, but the jackal, with such ardor and enthusiasm, devoted himself to his task that his eyes almost never followed the movement of his hands when they reached for the glass, resulting in him groping for one or two minutes more than four times before finding the glass and bringing it to his lips.</t1530> <t1531>On two or three occasions, he must have found the matter he was studying so convoluted that he considered it necessary to get up from the chair and dampen the towels again.</t1531>
<t1532>After a while, the jackal managed to prepare an acceptable meal for the lion and proceeded to offer it to him.</t1532> <t1533>The lion tried to digest it carefully and with exquisite precautions, separating some delicacies, dispensing with some components, and making judicious observations, which seemed agreeable to the jackal.</t1533> <t1534>Having digested the meal, the lion lay down on the sofa, while the jackal, after revitalizing himself again with libations and cold water compresses, dedicated himself to the preparation of the second meal, which was served to the lion in the same manner as the previous one.</t1534> <t1535>The clocks were already striking three in the morning.</t1535>
<t1536>—Now that we have finished, Carton, we will have a punch.</t1536>
<t1537>The jackal removed the towels from his head, yawned, stretched, and prepared the punch.</t1537>
<t1538>—You were right, Carton, regarding the witnesses this morning: everything went perfectly.</t1538>
<t1539>—It seems to me that I always have it: will you dare to say otherwise?</t1539>
<t1540>—No, man, no!</t1540> <t1541>You come today with a ruffled temper, my friend.</t1541> <t1542>It wouldn't hurt to sprinkle it with a good downpour of punch to soften it.</t1542>
<t1543>The jackal responded with a growl, but followed the advice.</t1543>
<t1544>—The good Sydney Carton, lawyer from the Faculty of Zorrilandia, is a kind of swing—observed Stryver.</t1544><t1545>—As soon as he is up, he is down: in a minute he goes from being all fire to being all despair.</t1545>
<t1546>—Ah, yes!—replied Carton, letting out a sigh.</t1546><t1547>—Even as a student, I was motivated by the affairs of my classmates, very rarely by my own.</t1547>
<t1548>—But why not?</t1548>
<t1549>—Who knows!</t1549> <t1550>By temperament, I suppose.</t1550>
<t1551>He sat down, having said these words, with his hands in his pockets, legs stretched out, and looking at the fire.</t1551>
<t1552>—You cannot deny, Carton—said Stryver to the former student of the Faculty of Foxland,—that your temperament, your way of being, is and has always been flawed.</t1552> <t1553>It suffers from a lack of energy, a lack of unity of purpose.</t1553> <t1554>Look at me.</t1554>
<t1555>—Sermons at this point?—exclaimed Carton, laughing cynically.</t1555><t1556>—Now is when I believe that thing about the preaching devil...</t1556>
<t1557>—How could I have gotten to where I am?</t1557> <t1558>How do I hold the position I hold?</t1558>
<t1559>—Partly, thanks to my cooperation, I suppose.</t1559> <t1560>But let's leave these discussions that won't lead us to anything practical.</t1560> <t1561>You do whatever you want, you've always been in the forefront, and I, on the other hand, have always been in the background.</t1561>
<t1562>"I had to make my own way if I wanted to place myself in the front row, as I don't know that I was born into it," replied Stryver.</t1562>
<t1563>—I did not have the honor of witnessing the ceremony of your birth, but I believe that when you were brought into the world, you were placed among the privileged.</t1563>
<t1564>The two interlocutors burst into laughter.</t1564>
<t1565>—Before attending Zorrilandia University—replied Carton,—while we were attending, and after we graduated from it, you were in a different league from mine.</t1565> <t1566>Even when we were in Paris learning to mumble French and acquiring some notions of French law, and familiarizing ourselves with many other French trivialities that are of no use to us, you were something, while I was always Mr. Nobody.</t1566>
<t1567>—Whose fault was it?</t1567>
<t1568>—By my life, I won't be the one to claim that it wasn't your fault!</t1568> <t1569>You were so lively, you stood out so much, you moved, you stirred in such a way, that I don't know what else I could do but remain shrouded in shadows and condemned to rest...</t1569> <t1570>But let's leave this topic, for it is not very pleasant, by my faith, to talk about one's dark past at the break of day.</t1570>
<t1571>—Perfectly—said Stryver, raising the glass.</t1571><t1572>—We will talk about your pretty witness.</t1572> <t1573>Don't you think it's a more pleasant topic?</t1573>
<t1574>It shouldn't have been, judging by the shadow that darkened his face.</t1574>
<t1575>—The beautiful witness!—he exclaimed, fixing his eyes on the bottom of the glass.</t1575><t1576>—I have seen many witnesses today... Who are you referring to?</t1576>
<t1577>—To the precious daughter of the doctor, to Miss Manette.</t1577>
<t1578>—Is she pretty?</t1578>
<t1579>—Isn't it, perhaps?</t1579>
<t1580>—No.</t1580>
<t1581>—But man of God!...</t1581> <t1582>It has been the admiration of the entire court!</t1582>
<t1583>—To hell with the court and its admiration!</t1583> <t1584>Who made the Old Bailey a judge of beauty? Pretty!...</t1584> <t1585>A doll with golden hair!...</t1585>
<t1586>—You know, Carton—asked Stryver, giving his friend a penetrating look and passing his right hand over his red face,—that I'm starting to believe you've sympathized too much with that golden-haired doll, and that your interest quickly noticed what was happening to that golden-haired doll?</t1586>
<t1587>—I warned too soon!</t1587> <t1588>It seems to me that if a girl, doll or not, faints two yards from any Christian's nose, they can notice it without looking through a telescope.</t1588> <t1589>The topic of conversation doesn't displease me, but I deny the beauty part...</t1589> <t1590>I'm not drinking anymore!... I'm going to bed!</t1590>
<t1591>When the owner of the house accompanied Carton to the landing, to light his way with the candle he held in his hand as he descended the stairs, the uncertain glimmers of the new day began to filter through the fogged-up windows.</t1591> <t1592>Once he reached the street, the jackal was seen breathing a cold and sad atmosphere, under a sky covered with clouds, bordering a river of dark waters and in places that seemed like the desert of life.</t1592> <t1593>Whirlwinds of dust fled, spinning vertiginously before the morning breeze, as if far, far away, the sands of the desert had taken flight and their first clouds threatened to envelop the city.</t1593>
<t1594>Lacking internal stimuli to ignite his energies, and placed in the center of an endless wasteland, that man stood upright for a few minutes and saw, in the distant reaches of the desolate and sad steppe that stretched out before his gaze, mirages of noble ambition, reflections of selflessness and perseverance.</t1594> <t1595>In the enchanted city that emerged before his eyes, there were lofty galleries from where cherubs and graces smiled at him, beautiful gardens where the sweet fruits of life ripened, and waters of hope that leapt with a murmur.</t1595> <t1596>The vision faded as quickly as it had appeared.</t1596> <t1597>A little later, he climbed the steep stairs to his sad room and fell onto the disheveled clothes of his bed.</t1597>
<t1598>His pillow was soaked with tears when a sickly, sad, melancholic sun rose, though not as much as that man of indisputable talent, of great gifts, and yet, incapable of feeling sweet emotions, incapable of navigating the paths of life, incapable of providing himself with well-being, incapable of savoring a drop of happiness, sensitive only to the eternal night in which he struggled and resigned to never leaving it.</t1598>
<t1599>VI.</t1599>
<t1600>HUNDREDS OF VISITS</t1600>
<t1601>Dr. Manette resided in one of the city's quietest streets, not far from Soho Square.</t1601> <t1602>On a delightful Sunday afternoon, when the eternal waves of four months had passed over the criminal case for treason, relegating it to oblivion and dragging it out to sea to regions beyond public interest and memory, Mr. Maurice Lorry was striding briskly through the sunlit streets between Clerkenwell, where he lived, and the doctor's house, where he was to dine that evening.</t1602> <t1603>It is well for readers to know that Lorry, after several periods of complete withdrawal and total absorption in business, had eventually become an intimate friend of the doctor and saw the quiet street where he lived as the most delightful oasis of his life.</t1603>
<t1604>Three very important reasons were driving Mr. Lorry, on this delightful Sunday, towards Soho Square in the early afternoon.</t1604> <t1605>First: because before lunch, he almost always used to go for a walk accompanying the doctor and his daughter Lucia.</t1605> <t1606>Second, because on Sunday afternoons, if it was not very pleasant, he would spend it with them, as a family friend, talking, reading, looking out the window, and constantly moving around, and third, because he wanted to resolve some intricate doubts, and he knew that nowhere was it as likely that he would find the solution as in the doctor's house.</t1606>
<t1607>There was no more picturesque corner in all of London than the one where the doctor lived.</t1607> <t1608>Isolated from the main arteries of the city, there was hardly any traffic, and from the balconies at the front of the house, one could enjoy beautiful views that bore the stamp of tranquility.</t1608> <t1609>The buildings were very scarce, and even more so towards the north of Oxford Road, in whose now vanished expansive fields, delightful groves stood, colorful flowers grew spontaneously, saturating the air with fragrant emanations, and lovely buds sprouted from the white hawthorns and the hawthorns.</t1609> <t1610>As a result, the air circulated freely around Soho, whose inhabitants were not compelled to breathe the mephitic and poisonous atmosphere of the great centers where the poor suffocate and the rich languish.</t1610> <t1611>Near the doctor's balconies, there was more than one pear tree, whose fruits ripened in due time.</t1611>
<t1612>The rays of the summer sun radiantly penetrated that delightful retreat in the early hours of the day, but when they burned, when they turned the other districts of the city into a scorching oven, the little corner remained enveloped in shadows, although these were not so deep that they couldn't be penetrated by the brilliant glows of a distant sun.</t1612> <t1613>It was, in a word, a cool, calm, and tranquil place, yet pleasant, a sheltered harbor against the roar and bustling agitation of the streets.</t1613>
<t1614>An ideal anchorage was inconceivable without a tranquil boat, and indeed, it had one.</t1614> <t1615>The doctor occupied two floors of a rather spacious house, at whose doors many knocked during the night, requesting services to be rendered the following day.</t1615> <t1616>At the back of the house, separated from it by a courtyard in the center of which grew a wild banana tree, there was a building where church organs were manufactured, and a mysterious giant chiseled silver and hammered gold, whose powerful arm seemed to emerge from the wall, casting golden flashes, as if the arm itself were made of gold and threatened to turn into gold all those who visited that place.</t1616> <t1617>Hardly did these industries make the slightest noise, very rarely was a solitary visitor seen arriving, and even more rarely did a carriage cross those peaceful spots.</t1617> <t1618>It was true that from time to time a worker could be seen crossing the courtyard while putting on his jacket, or an unknown person drawn by curiosity, or the distant echo of a hammer blow from the golden giant would strike the ears, but these were the only exceptions, always necessary to prove the rule that this was the corner of echoes, the center of rest and silence, interrupted only by the chirping of sparrows that had their headquarters in the top of the wild banana tree.</t1618>
<t1619>The doctor Manette received in his house the patients brought to him by his former reputation combined with the floating breezes of the painful history of his life.</t1619> <t1620>His scientific knowledge, his practice in the difficult exercise of his profession, and the ingenious experiments he engaged in, gave him a very enviable clientele and he earned more than enough to cover the necessities of life.</t1620>
<t1621>All this was perfectly known to the good Mauricio Lorry when he pulled the chain hanging along the door, and set in motion the inhabitants of the quiet house located in the delightful little corner I just described, on a Sunday afternoon.</t1621>
<t1622>—Is the doctor at home?</t1622>
<t1623>—No, sir.</t1623>
<t1624>—And Miss Lucía?</t1624>
<t1625>—Neither.</t1625>
<t1626>—And Miss Pross?</t1626>
<t1627>Probably the latter was at home, but since the maid who opened the door did not know what her intentions were regarding admitting or denying the fact, she also replied that she was not.</t1627>
<t1628>—In any case, I'm going up—replied Lorry,—because I consider myself here as at home.</t1628>
<t1629>Although the doctor's daughter learned nothing in her homeland, it is certain that it initiated her into that rare skill of doing much with scarce means, which was one of her most precious and pleasant characteristics.</t1629> <t1630>Modest and simple was the furniture in the house's rooms, and yet, some trinkets, which had no more real value than the exquisite taste with which they were placed, gave them a delightful effect.</t1630> <t1631>The arrangement of everything in the house, starting with the largest piece of furniture and ending with the most insignificant object, the combination of colors, and the contrast achieved thanks to trifles by delicate hands, clear-eyed gazes, and impeccable taste, offered such a pleasant ensemble in itself and portrayed its author so graphically, that it seemed as if, with a silent but eloquent language, they asked Mr. Lorry, while he gazed at them in rapture, if they deserved his approval.</t1631>
<t1632>The apartment had three main rooms, whose connecting doors were all open, so that the air could circulate through them like lords and masters.</t1632> <t1633>Lorry passed from one to another, smiling and pleased.</t1633> <t1634>In the first room, which was the best, Lucía had her birds, her books, a writing desk, and a sewing box, as well as a box of colors; the second room was the doctor's consultation room, which also served as a dining room, and the third room, near whose balconies the leaves of the wild plane tree growing in the courtyard whispered, was the doctor's bedroom, in one of whose corners Lorry saw the cobbler's bench and tools, just as they had once been in the attic of the tavern in the San Antonio neighborhood of Paris.</t1634>
<t1635>—It surprises me—murmured Lorry in a clear and intelligible voice—that he keeps these objects which must necessarily remind him of his sufferings and miseries.</t1635>
<t1636>—And why should it surprise you?—asked a brusque voice suddenly, causing him to turn around quickly.</t1636>
<t1637>The voice originated from Miss Pross's throat, who was the same red-faced, strong, and heavy-handed woman with whom Lorry became acquainted at the Hotel George in Dover.</t1637>
<t1638>—I imagined...—Lorry began to say.</t1638>
<t1639>—It seemed to her... what?—replied Miss Pross.</t1639><t1640>—Some nonsense, no doubt!</t1640>
<t1641>Lorry did not answer.</t1641>
<t1642>—How are you?—asked the lady then, with a harsh voice, though without malice or intent to offend.</t1642>
<t1643>—Very well, thank you... and you?</t1643>
<t1644>—As discontent as can be.</t1644>
<t1645>—Is it possible?</t1645>
<t1646>—And very possible!</t1646> <t1647>What happens with Miss Lucía drives me crazy.</t1647>
<t1648>—Is it possible?</t1648>
<t1649>—But man of God!</t1649> <t1650>Haven't you learned more than those two words that you keep saying at every turn?</t1650> <t1651>Is it possible!...</t1651> <t1652>A little variation, if you don't want to drive me completely crazy!</t1652>
<t1653>—Really?—asked Lorry, correcting himself.</t1653>
<t1654>—It's not the happiest phrase, so to speak, but, in the end, it's better than his eternal "could it be possible."</t1654> <t1655>Well, yes, sir; what happens with the young lady drives me crazy.</t1655>
<t1656>—Would it be indiscreet to ask the reason?</t1656>
<t1657>—It gets on my nerves that dozens of people who are not worthy of her come to see her.</t1657>
<t1658>—Dozens?—asked Lorry in amazement.</t1658>
<t1659>—Hundreds—replied Miss Pross, one of whose characteristics, which is often seen in many people, was to exaggerate the original statement if she noticed that someone was questioning it.</t1659>
<t1660>—Good heavens!—exclaimed Lorry, who couldn't think of a more appropriate response.</t1660>
<t1661>—Since the young lady was ten years old, I have lived with her... or she has lived with me, and she has paid me, which I would never have allowed, rest assured, if I had found the secret of taking care of myself and her for nothing.</t1661> <t1662>Oh! It is truly painful!</t1662>
<t1663>Lorry, not clearly seeing what could be painful, limited himself to shaking his head, using that part of his person as the most suitable cover to hide everything.</t1663>
<t1664>—At all hours, countless people who are not worthy of my treasure, Mr. Lorry, hover around him.</t1664> <t1665>No, they are not, not by a long shot!</t1665> <t1666>When you started the parade...</t1666>
<t1667>—Did I start it, Miss Pross?</t1667>
<t1668>—Of course! Who took his father out of the grave?</t1668>
<t1669>—If that was the beginning...</t1669>
<t1670>—I suppose you do not mean to say that was the end of it...</t1670> <t1671>I repeat that when the parade began, it was already quite unpleasant.</t1671> <t1672>And note that it is not my intention to say that Dr. Manette is to blame, in whom I see no other fault than not being worthy of having a daughter like the one he has, and that is not attributable to him, since there is no person in the world who is worthy of it.</t1672> <t1673>I might have been able to forgive the father, but admit that it is horribly painful to see crowds and swarms of people constantly moving around the father and stealing the affection of the daughter from me.</t1673>
<t1674>Lorry knew that Miss Pross was the embodiment of jealousy, but at the same time, he was aware that, aside from her eccentricities, she was at the forefront of those pure beings devoid of all selfishness who, driven by motives of affection and admiration, willingly offer their necks to the chain of slavery, ready to sacrifice themselves for a youth they have lost, a beauty they never possessed, gifts and perfections they never had the fortune to attain, and hopeful dreams that never shed a ray of light on their somber lives.</t1674> <t1675>Lorry had a sufficiently perfect understanding of the world to know that nothing compares to the faithful and selfless services that reside in the heart, and consequently, Miss Pross's services earned his highest respect. In the mental classifications he made, for no one fails to make them, in greater or lesser numbers, he placed the red-haired and efficient lady much closer to the last rung of the angels than to many ladies who were incomparably better endowed than she, both by Nature and by Art, and who, in addition, possessed capitals deposited in the vaults of Tellson's Bank.</t1675>
<t1676>—There has never been, nor will there ever be, a man worthy of the young lady—said Miss Pross.</t1676><t1677>—That man was my brother Solomon... if he hadn't had a little slip in life.</t1677>
<t1678>An observation: the investigations carried out by Lorry regarding Miss Pross's personal history had resulted in the discovery and verification of the fact that her brother Solomon was a miserable scoundrel who stole everything she owned under the pretext of speculating and trading, then left her abandoned in her misery without a shred of remorse.</t1678> <t1679>The high opinion that Miss Pross had of her brother, despite his small slip, was a source of profound admiration for Mr. Lorry and contributed to greatly increasing the respect he felt for her.</t1679>
<t1680>—Since we find ourselves alone at this moment, and we are both business people—said Lorry when, moments later, they had both sat down in the parlor,—I will allow myself to ask you a question:</t1680> <t1681>In the conversations that the doctor has with his daughter, does he ever refer to the times when he made shoes?</t1681>
<t1682>—Never.</t1682>
<t1683>—And yet, he keeps the stool and the tools of the trade in his room.</t1683>
<t1684>—I have said that he never talks about it with his daughter—replied Miss Pross,—but I will be very careful not to assert that he does not talk to himself about it.</t1684>
<t1685>—Do you think he/she thinks about it often?</t1685>
<t1686>—Yes.</t1686>
<t1687>—Can you imagine?...</t1687>
<t1688>—I never imagine!—exclaimed Miss Pross, interrupting her interlocutor.</t1688><t1689>—I have no imagination, nor do I need it.</t1689>
<t1690>—I will correct myself...</t1690> <t1691>Do you suppose... do you sometimes go so far as to suppose?</t1691>
<t1692>—From time to time, yes.</t1692>
<t1693>—Well then, do you suppose that Dr. Manette harbors any suspicion... or certainty, that has survived his past miseries, about the cause, the motives of his misfortune?</t1693> <t1694>Do you perhaps suppose that he even suspects or knows who his oppressor was?</t1694>
<t1695>—I don't assume anything more than what the young lady tells me.</t1695>
<t1696>—And the young lady says...</t1696>
<t1697>—That he believes his father suspects or knows.</t1697>
<t1698>—Don't get upset if I ask you these questions.</t1698> <t1699>I am a businessman, quite obtuse, and you are a businesswoman.</t1699>
<t1700>—Obtuse?—inquired Miss Pross.</t1700>
<t1701>—No, no, no!—replied Lorry.</t1701><t1702>—You are not obtuse at all!</t1702> <t1703>But returning to the matter, allow me to ask: isn't it strange, incomprehensible, that Dr. Manette, innocent of any crime as we all know, always avoids touching on that issue with such care?</t1703> <t1704>And it's not that I am surprised he doesn't bring it up with me, even though we had frequent business relations years ago and today we share a close friendship, but I am amazed that he doesn't talk about it with his daughter, who loves him so much and whom he adores...</t1704> <t1705>Believe me, Miss Pross, it is not curiosity that dictates my words, but the deep affection I feel for the inhabitants of this house.</t1705>
<t1706>—Well then, as I believe... and when I believe something, I usually get close to reality, keep that silence that so amazes you because you are afraid to talk about the matter.</t1706>
<t1707>—Fear?</t1707>
<t1708>—It is clear as day, and I also find the fear very justified.</t1708> <t1709>They are horrifying memories, not only because of what he suffered, but also because in his suffering his intelligence was shipwrecked.</t1709> <t1710>Since he does not know how and when he lost it, and how and when he regained it, it is natural that he fears losing it again.</t1710> <t1711>As you can understand, this consideration alone would be enough to make talking about the matter unpleasant for him.</t1711>
<t1712>—It's true—replied Lorry, who was satisfied with the deep observation of his interlocutor.</t1712><t1713>—Out of necessity, it must inspire fear in him to speak of his ordeal...</t1713> <t1714>However, Miss Pross, I very much doubt that it is good for his peace of mind to keep such dreadful memories buried deep in his heart, and these doubts, and the unease they often cause me, are precisely what have led me to provoke these confidences.</t1714>
<t1715>—Evil, if it truly is evil, has no remedy—replied Miss Pross, shaking her head.</t1715><t1716>—Touch that string, and the results will be counterproductive; so, it is better to remain silent.</t1716> <t1717>How many times, in the late hours of the night, he jumps out of bed and begins to pace agitatedly, up and down, up and down, through his room!</t1717> <t1718>Miss knows by now that when this happens, her father's imagination is pacing up and down, up and down, through the dungeon that served as his tomb for so many years.</t1718> <t1719>She then runs to her father's room and, standing by his side, paces with him up and down, up and down, until she is convinced he has calmed down.</t1719> <t1720>But the doctor never explains the cause of his unrest, and his daughter never asks him.</t1720> <t1721>The two of them pace together up and down, up and down, without uttering a word, until the presence of his daughter, and the blind love she has for him, bring the doctor back to himself.</t1721>
<t1722>Miss Pross had denied that she had any imagination, but the evidence that a sad idea haunted her gave the lie to her assertion, evidence highlighted by the repetition of the phrase "up and down," as there was no doubt that it was a fixed idea.</t1722>
<t1723>The doctor's house seemed like the house of echoes.</t1723> <t1724>At the mention of the doctor's agitated nocturnal walks, the sound of approaching footsteps responded, and to these, the end of the conference.</t1724>
<t1725>—They are here!—exclaimed Miss Pross, standing up quickly.</t1725><t1726>—It won't be long before people arrive at this house by the hundreds.</t1726>
<t1727>Such marvelous acoustic conditions were gathered in that house that it could very well have been called the ear of the district.</t1727> <t1728>Lorry, who was leaning out the window and could perfectly hear the sound of the father and daughter's footsteps, thought they would never arrive.</t1728> <t1729>Not only did the echoes of the approaching footsteps reach him, but also many others that faded away just when they seemed closest.</t1729> <t1730>Finally, the doctor appeared, giving his arm to his daughter, and they were received at the door of the house by Miss Pross.</t1730>
<t1731>It was charming to see Miss Pross, despite her ugliness, her bright red color, and her frowning expression, hurrying to take off her lady's hat as she climbed the stairs; how, to avoid staining it, she wrapped her fingers with a handkerchief, how she tried to remove the dust by blowing on it, how she fluffed her splendid blonde hair with as much pride and satisfaction as she would have done with her own, assuming she had been the most beautiful and vain woman in creation.</t1731> <t1732>It was also charming to see the lady hugging her maid, thanking her and protesting against so much attention and work, though protesting with a smile on her lips, for if she did not, Miss Pross, deeply hurt, would have retired to her room to spend the day crying.</t1732> <t1733>It was no less charming to see the doctor gazing at them with rapture and to hear him tell Miss Pross that she was spoiling Lucie with so much attention and care, but with such a sweet tone and tender look that it was enough, and even more than enough, to spoil Miss Pross and a hundred more like her, and finally, it was also charming to see Mr. Lorry adjusting his wig and mentally thanking his lucky star that, if it made him a confirmed bachelor, it allowed him to glimpse, in his old age, the pure joys of a home.</t1733> <t1734>Everything was charming, but the hundreds of people who were supposed to revolve around Lucie were nowhere to be seen, and Mr. Lorry waited in vain for Miss Pross's prophecy to come true.</t1734>
<t1735>The time to sit at the table had come, but the hundreds were not arriving.</t1735>
<t1736>In the distribution of household chores, Miss Pross had reserved the scepter of the lower regions of the house for herself, and it must be confessed that she wielded it marvelously.</t1736> <t1737>It was impossible to bring her meals, modest in themselves, to a greater degree of perfection, but they were admirably cooked and even more admirably served, according to a taste that was half French and half English.</t1737> <t1738>Since Miss Pross's dedication was eminently practical, she had scoured every corner of Soho and the adjacent territories in search of poor French people who, tempted by the cheerful jingle of shillings and half-crowns, revealed to her all the mysteries of the culinary art.</t1738> <t1739>She learned so many wonderful skills from those sons and daughters of Gaul that the woman and the girl who made up the household staff saw her as a sorceress, a grandmother of Cinderella capable of taking a chicken, a rabbit, or a couple of potatoes in her hands and turning them into whatever dish she fancied.</t1739>
<t1740>Miss Pross would sit at the doctor's family table on Sundays, but on the other days of the week, she would usually eat at unknown hours, either in the lower regions or in her room, located on the second floor, which was off-limits to everyone except Miss Lucie.</t1740> <t1741>At the Sunday meal referred to in this account, Miss Pross, responding to the joy reflected on the doctor's daughter's face and wishing to please her, allowed herself an unusual liveliness, and as a result, the time the diners spent at the table was most pleasant.</t1741>
<t1742>It was a day of scorching heat, in view of which, at dessert, Miss Lucía proposed going to drink the wine under the wild plane tree in the courtyard, where they could enjoy a more pleasant atmosphere.</t1742> <t1743>As everyone was eager to please the spoiled one of the house, they immediately went out to the courtyard and took a seat under the plane tree, where Lucía, who for some time had assigned herself the role of Mr. Lorry's cupbearer, poured the wine.</t1743> <t1744>Rooftops of nearby houses seemed to peek their heads over the courtyard fences while the gathered ones talked, and the leaves of the plane tree whispered in their ears the murmuring words typical of their varnished tongues.</t1744>
<t1745>The meal had ended, but the hundreds of visitors did not show up.</t1745> <t1746>When the diners were seated under the banana tree, young Darnay arrived, but he was just one.</t1746>
<t1747>The doctor Manette gave him a cordial welcome, and his daughter did the same.</t1747> <t1748>Miss Pross, suddenly overcome by a sensation of tingling in her head and the rest of her body, withdrew into the house.</t1748> <t1749>It seems that she was frequently a victim of that disorder, which she, within the family, used to call "a nervous attack."</t1749>
<t1750>The doctor was in an excellent mood and seemed very young.</t1750> <t1751>Sitting next to his daughter, whose head was resting on his shoulder, the striking resemblance between them was so evident that even the most shortsighted person would notice it.</t1751>
<t1752>The conversation touched on many and very varied topics, with the doctor being one of those who showed the most liveliness and animation.</t1752> <t1753>On an occasion when they were talking about the most notable buildings in London, Darnay asked him:</t1753>
<t1754>—Tell me, doctor, have you visited the Tower?</t1754>
<t1755>—I visited it with Lucía on one occasion, but briefly, without stopping—replied the doctor.</t1755><t1756>—We saw enough to appreciate that it is indeed worthy of interest, but nothing more.</t1756>
<t1757>—I have been there, as you remember—replied Darnay with a slightly forced smile,—but not as a tourist nor in conditions to see much of it.</t1757> <t1758>A little story was told to me during my stay that powerfully caught my attention.</t1758>
<t1759>—Why don't you tell it to us?—asked Lucía.</t1759>
<t1760>—With great pleasure.</t1760> <t1761>It seems that, during the course of some construction work that had to be done, the workers found an ancient dungeon, used in a remote time and forgotten for many years.</t1761> <t1762>All the interior stones were full of inscriptions carved into the stone by the prisoners.</t1762> <t1763>The inscriptions were dates, names, complaints, curses, prayers, etc.</t1763> <t1764>On the stone of a corner of the wall, a convict, condemned to death, in all probability, carved four letters at the last moment.</t1764> <t1765>He must have used a tool not well-suited for the purpose, and did the work hastily and with an unsteady hand.</t1765> <t1766>Upon examining the letters, everyone initially believed they were G. A. V. A., but a closer observation revealed that the first letter was not G, but C.</t1766> <t1767>There was no record in the archives of any prisoner whose name and surname corresponded to those initials.</t1767> <t1768>After much thought and consideration, it was realized that the letters in question were not initials, but a complete name: Cava.</t1768> <t1769>Some excavations were carried out, which resulted in the discovery, beneath a slab or tile, of some fragments of paper, mixed with pieces of a small box or leather pouch.</t1769> <t1770>No one has been able to find out what the condemned man wrote on the paper, although it was clear that something was written.</t1770> <t1771>Undoubtedly, he buried it so that the warden would not find it.</t1771>
<t1772>—My father!—exclaimed Lucía.</t1772><t1773>—Are you feeling ill?</t1773>
<t1774>This question was prompted by the fact that the doctor stood up violently and put his hands on his head.</t1774> <t1775>His face reflected horrible fright.</t1775>
<t1776>—No, my daughter, I am not sick—replied the doctor.</t1776><t1777>—It is starting to rain... very large drops are falling and I got scared thoughtlessly.</t1777> <t1778>I think we should take cover.</t1778>
<t1779>He had recovered almost instantly.</t1779> <t1780>It was true that the clouds were sending down some large drops of water, one of which the doctor showed on the back of his hand.</t1780> <t1781>He did not say a word about the story that Darnay was telling, and when they entered the house, Lorry's expert eye discovered, or believed he discovered, in the doctor's look, as he fixed it on Darnay, the same strange look he had observed when they were leaving the Courtroom after the latter had been declared innocent.</t1781>
<t1782>The expression of that look disappeared so quickly that Lorry began to wonder if his expert eye had deceived him.</t1782> <t1783>The giant with the golden arm could not have said with more serenity than the doctor, who still had not steeled himself against small surprises, and that the drop of water, falling on the back of his hand, had startled him.</t1783>
<t1784>Miss Pross prepared the tea, served it, resisted another "nervous attack," and the hundreds of visitors continued without showing any signs of presence.</t1784> <t1785>Mr. Carton arrived, but between him and Darnay, they did not add up to more than two.</t1785>
<t1786>The night was so warm that despite having taken the precaution of leaving doors and windows open, no sooner had they finished their tea than everyone headed to a balcony in search of fresh air to breathe.</t1786> <t1787>Lucía sat next to her father, Darnay next to Lucía, and Carton leaned his back against the railing.</t1787> <t1788>The balcony curtains were white, and when a gust of wind stirred them, lifting them to the ceiling, they looked more like spectral wings than curtains.</t1788>
<t1789>—Wide, sparse, and heavy drops are still falling—said the doctor.</t1789><t1790>—It is approaching very slowly.</t1790>
<t1791>—But with great certainty—replied Carton.</t1791>
<t1792>The people hurriedly fled the streets, yearning to get under a roof before the storm broke.</t1792> <t1793>The sound of their footsteps reached the marvelous little corner of echoes, but without anyone seeing those who walked.</t1793>
<t1794>—Many people moving, and yet, the most absolute solitude—observed Darnay, after a few moments of attention.</t1794>
<t1795>—Doesn't it make an impression, Mr. Darnay?—asked Lucía.</t1795><t1796>—Many nights I sit in this very spot, and my imagination... but even the madwoman of the house insists on scaring me tonight... so gloomy... so solemn...</t1796>
<t1797>—We will all get scared—said Darnay, joking.</t1797><t1798>—We will see what fear tastes like.</t1798>
<t1799>—It won't taste like anything to you.</t1799> <t1800>Those extravagances only impress those whose imagination forges them, I believe: they are not contagious.</t1800> <t1801>I repeat that many nights I have sat in this very spot, alone, ears attentive, and my imagination has given tangible form to the echoes, and has seen in them the people who have been or will soon be connected with my life.</t1801>
<t1802>—The day comes when many people establish close relationships with our lives—observed Carton.</t1802>
<t1803>The sound of footsteps was incessant, and the rush of people fleeing, more frantic.</t1803> <t1804>It seemed that footsteps were sounding beneath the balcony, in the very room, some going, others coming, some moving away and others approaching, and yet, the sight did not reveal a living soul.</t1804>
<t1805>—Do you reserve all the sound of footsteps reaching our ears for yourself alone, Miss Manette, or would you prefer that we share them among us all?—asked Darnay with a humorous tone.</t1805>
<t1806>—I don't know what to answer you, Mr. Darnay.</t1806> <t1807>I started by saying it was an extravagance, a foolishness of mine, but the fault for me saying it was yours, for asking me.</t1807> <t1808>When that idea has made an impression on me, I have always found myself alone, and perhaps this circumstance has led me to believe that the echoes repeated the sound of the footsteps of the people who are to have an influence on my life or on my father's.</t1808>
<t1809>—I claim them so that they may exercise them in mine—replied Carton.</t1809><t1810>—Let them come upon me, without explanations, without conditions.</t1810> <t1811>At this moment, vast crowds are ready to descend upon us...</t1811> <t1812>I am seeing them in the light... crimson of the lightning—he finished saying, just as a gigantic serpent of fire streaked through the air.</t1812>
<t1813>A horrendous thunder sounded, and Carton replied:</t1813>
<t1814>—And now I hear them...</t1814> <t1815>Look at how they approach, fast... furious... roaring!</t1815>
<t1816>The tremendous voice of the unleashed elements forced Carton to put an end to his extravagances, simply because no one could hear them.</t1816> <t1817>The storm was horrific.</t1817> <t1818>Water poured down in torrents from a blazing sky, accompanied by such deafening thunder that it seemed as if the world was being shattered into pieces.</t1818> <t1819>Around midnight, the moon emerged, placid and serene.</t1819>
<t1820>It was striking one in the morning at the tower of San Pablo when Mr. Lorry, accompanied by Jeremiah Lapa, armed with his corresponding lantern, began the journey back to Clerkenwell.</t1820>
<t1821>—What a night, Jeremiah, what a night!—exclaimed Lorry—The most suitable for the dead to rise from their graves!</t1821>
<t1822>—I have never seen them leave, sir, nor do I expect to see it—replied Jeremías Lapa.</t1822>
<t1823>—Good evening, Mr. Carton!—said Lorry.</t1823><t1824>—Good evening, Mr. Darnay!</t1824> <t1825>Will we ever see a night like this together again?</t1825>
<t1826>Who knows!</t1826> <t1827>Perhaps the day would come when they would see innumerable crowds, roaring, drunk with blood, closing in on them!</t1827>
<t1828>VII.</t1828>
<t1829>THE LORD IN THE CITY</t1829>
<t1830>The gentleman, one of the most influential and powerful magnates of the court, was holding his customary biweekly reception in his sumptuous palace in Paris.</t1830> <t1831>The gentleman was in his most intimate study, a sort of sanctuary for the throng of worshippers in charge of serving the rest of the rooms.</t1831> <t1832>The gentleman was about to have his chocolate.</t1832> <t1833>With marvelous ease, the gentleman could swallow a thousand things, and there were even many, undoubtedly malicious people, who firmly believed that he was devouring France at an astonishing speed, but the morning chocolate could not pass down the gentleman's throat without the help of four strong men, not to mention the cook.</t1833>
<t1834>Yes, such an important operation required four men, four men covered in gold braid, with a leader who, in his eagerness to follow the noble and chaste fashion set by his lord, could not have lived without carrying two enormous gold watches in his pocket. They were indispensable so that the fortunate chocolate could have the honor of reaching the lord's lips.</t1834> <t1835>A footman carried the chocolate pot to the sacred presence of the lord; another stirred the chocolate with an instrument reserved for such an important function, another, the third, presented the favored napkin, and the fourth (the one with the two gold watches) poured the chocolate into the cup.</t1835> <t1836>Could the lord do without even one of the four servants while he took the chocolate among the heavens that admired and pleased witnessed the operation?</t1836> <t1837>Horror!</t1837> <t1838>To take the chocolate served by only three men would have been equivalent to staining the lord's immaculate shield: to take it served ignobly by two would have been as much as giving him death.</t1838>
<t1839>The previous night, the gentleman had attended a private dinner, following an admirable performance of a comedy and an opera.</t1839> <t1840>The gentleman used to attend almost every night similar dinners, in whose events he was surrounded by charming and fascinating company.</t1840> <t1841>So refined, so impressionable was the gentleman, that in his elevated soul, the comedy and the opera exerted more influence than the arid and tedious affairs of the State and the needs of France, a fortunate circumstance for this nation, as it always is for those that are or have been as favored as she... as it was, for example, for England in the never sufficiently mourned times of the jovial Stuarts.</t1841>
<t1842>The gentleman had a most noble idea about public affairs in general, which was that they should be allowed to follow their natural course, and another idea, no less noble, about private affairs... that they too should follow their natural course; and the natural course of the former, like the natural course of the latter, was to go straight into the gentleman's hands and pocket.</t1842> <t1843>As for pleasures, both general and private, the gentleman believed that the world had been created for him to enjoy them, and man placed in it for that purpose.</t1843> <t1844>His motto was the following: "The world and all it contains is mine, says the Lord."</t1844>
<t1845>Despite his opinions, the gentleman had seen, with natural displeasure, that in his affairs and pleasures, both private and public, the most vulgar annoyances had come to mix in, which inevitably created difficulties and troubles, also of the most vulgar kind, in view of which, he decided to ally himself with a general steward, a resolution all the wiser as it had become indispensable, and this, for two main reasons.</t1845> <t1846>First: because the gentleman did not understand such vulgar matters as those related to public finance, and consequently, he had to entrust them to hands that understood them, and second, related to private finance, because general stewards are wealthy, while the gentleman, a descendant of lords who lived many generations of splendid luxury and pomp, was impoverishing day by day.</t1846> <t1847>Hence, the gentleman saved his sister from the veil that threatened her, and which was the most economical wedding trousseau he could gift her, and granted her as a precious prize to a general steward, as rich in goods as he was poor in family.</t1847> <t1848>This general steward, armed with a staff crowned by a golden apple, figured in the present occasion among the characters that filled the outer rooms and played a somewhat awkward role because the gentleman, and even the gentleman's wife, used to look at him with the deepest contempt.</t1848>
<t1849>The general overseer was a man of the utmost sumptuousness imaginable.</t1849> <t1850>Thirty horses occupied his stables, twenty-four servants awaited orders in his halls, and six maids helped dress his wife.</t1850> <t1851>In his capacity as a man whose sole mission was to plunder and loot wherever he could, the general overseer was at least the most tangible reality among the characters who were on duty in the lord's halls that day.</t1851>
<t1852>To tell the truth, in those halls, which offered delightful scenes to the eyes, in those halls, where they had accumulated everything that the art and taste of the time could produce, business was not going well, moreover: both when considered with reference to the scarecrows that surrounded the lord's person, and regarding the ragged ones who swarmed everywhere, matters were taking a rather unsettling turn... assuming that in the lord's house there was someone who cared about matters.</t1852> <t1853>Military men who were ignorant of what military science was, sailors who had no idea what a ship was, clergymen, covered in silks and lace, worldly to the inconceivable, with sensual eyes, free tongues, and customs freer than their tongues, in a word: ineptitude in those who held positions, debauchery in customs, lies on every lip.</t1853> <t1854>No less abundant were the people who, despite having no relation, remote or close, with the lord or the State, were obstinate in having no relation with anything real and just, and in not walking the journey of life on straight paths, nor pursuing an honorable earthly goal.</t1854> <t1855>Doctors who amassed immense fortunes pretending to cure imaginary diseases and ailments that had never existed, mocked their courtly clients from the sanctity of their homes, while the latter broke their backs making bows in the lord's halls.</t1855> <t1856>Projectors who, if they never found the remedy for the slightest sin, instead discovered daily universal panaceas with sure effects to correct the minor ills affecting the health of the State, annoyed with their endless and heavy speeches all those who attended the lord's receptions and had ears to listen to them.</t1856> <t1857>Atheist philosophers who aimed to cast new molds with their words to forge a new world, and erect new Towers of Babel to scale the heavens, conferred in the lord's halls with disbelieving chemists or alchemists, who pursued no other objective than the transmutation of metals.</t1857> <t1858>In the lord's palace, hordes of gentlemen with distinguished manners and exquisite education vegetated, sunk in the most exemplary state of enervation, whose natural fruits at that time, and have continued to be since then, were an invincible indifference, and a notable repugnance towards everything that should be the natural objective of human interest.</t1858> <t1859>In the homes that those brilliant notabilities left abandoned in the most aristocratic neighborhoods of Paris, the spies who frequented the lord's halls, to whose number belonged, by the way, at least half of those who courted him, would have hardly been able to find among the angels of their social class a woman who, by her customs, deserved the honor of being a mother.</t1859> <t1860>It is true that fashion did not allow mothers anything other than the material act of bringing a helpless creature into the world, which certainly is not much to do.</t1860> <t1861>It is acceptable that peasant women spend their lives beside their tender children: women born in another sphere must brighten the halls, and even when they are grandmothers, they must dress and dance as when they were twenty years old.</t1861>
<t1862>The leprosy of fiction disfigured all the human beings who served the lord.</t1862> <t1863>In one of the most remote rooms, there were half a dozen people who, exceptionally, for some years had been believing that things were generally following dangerous paths.</t1863> <t1864>Half of this half dozen exceptional people, in their eagerness to remedy the evils, had joined the fantastic sect of the so-called convulsionists, and spent their time deliberating whether it would be convenient for them to foam at the mouth, rage, roar, bellow, and become cataleptic, thus presenting before the lord's eyes a vision of the futures that could serve as a sure guide.</t1864> <t1865>Besides these dervishes, there were three others who had formed another sect whose objective was to straighten the tortuous course of events through convoluted theories about "The Center of Truth," maintaining that man had sprouted from this center... which needed no demonstration, but had exited the circumference, and that it was necessary to make him re-enter it and prevent him from exceeding its perimeter in the future, which would be achieved by invigorating the life of the spirit and weakening that of the flesh.</t1865> <t1866>As they never spoke of anything but spirits and incorporeal substances, it is not surprising that their speeches did not yield material results.</t1866>
<t1867>On the other hand, the people who frequented the gentleman's salons dressed admirably, which is no small consolation.</t1867> <t1868>If Judgment Day is to be simply and plainly a fashion show, where prizes are awarded to the best-dressed, it is quite certain that the fortunate individuals who inspire these lines will dress for eternity with impeccable taste and exceptional richness.</t1868> <t1869>The laborious hairstyles of those heads, so artistically curled and tastefully powdered, those delicate faces, defended against the ravages of time, and even amended and corrected thanks to commendable artificial means, the finely chiseled swords worn by the gentlemen, which delighted the eye in their contemplation, the fine and delicate perfumes that embalmed the air and delighted one of the senses with which the Creator pleased to endow man, were sufficient resources to eradicate the ills that afflicted humanity from the root and forever.</t1869> <t1870>The gentlemen of high lineage and refined education displayed a prodigious profusion of rich gold jewelry that emitted a delightful tinkling in time with their languid steps, and before the tinkling of gold and the rustling of silk and brocade, hunger and misery had no choice but to hide their sallow faces in the foul-smelling poor neighborhoods of the city.</t1870>
<t1871>The dress was the infallible talisman, the magic wand that compelled everyone and everything to remain in their respective places.</t1871> <t1872>No one could exempt themselves from wearing the costume imposed by the role they played in the extravagance ball called the world.</t1872> <t1873>The fiction began at the Tuileries, in the very person of the lord, and in those who made the court to the lord, and continued through the Chambers and Courts of Justice, until it reached the person of the executioner, who was obliged to officiate very "combed, curled, and powdered, wearing a luxurious gold-braided frock coat, and his calves encased in rich silk stockings."</t1873> <t1874>No!</t1874> <t1875>It is not possible that any of the fortunate mortals who attended the fortnightly reception given by the lord in the year seventeen eighty would question the durability of a system founded on such a solid base as an exquisitely combed, artistically curled, solicitously powdered executioner, adorned with a rich gold-braided frock coat and exquisite silk stockings.</t1875>
<t1876>Once the lord relieved his four servants of their respective burdens and took the chocolate, he ordered the doors of his sanctuary to be flung wide open and deigned to step outside.</t1876> <t1877>What submission, what cringing flattery, what servility, what humiliations, carried to the most inconceivable limits of the abject!</t1877> <t1878>Suffice it to say that in all matters concerning idolatry and self-annihilation, those who filled the halls reserved nothing for the heavens.</t1878> <t1879>It is true that thoughts of the afterlife concerned the lord's worshippers very little!</t1879>
<t1880>Uttering a word here and dropping a hope there, directing a smile at this one and making a hand gesture to that one, the gentleman crossed the halls until he surpassed the limits of the circumference of truth, where he majestically turned on his sacred heels and retraced his steps, to return and enclose himself in his sanctuary.</t1880>
<t1881>Once the exhibition ended, the whispers that barely touched the air turned into a clamorous storm.</t1881> <t1882>The tinkling of the jewels, similar to the incessant ringing of precious little bells, faded away, and very soon only one person remained in sight, a gentleman, who, with his hat under his arm and holding a snuffbox in his hand, amused himself by walking calmly and leisurely, stopping in front of the mirrors he encountered along the way.</t1882>
<t1883>—Take hell with you!—he murmured before leaving, his eyes turned towards the sanctuary door, shaking off the snuff that remained between his fingers.</t1883>
<t1884>He was a man of about sixty years, richly dressed, with haughty gestures and expression, and endowed with a face that, more than a human countenance, seemed like a fine mask.</t1884> <t1885>A face of transparent pallor, all its lines, all its features appeared perfectly defined.</t1885> <t1886>The nose, artistically shaped, had the peculiarity that its two nostrils showed a very slight contraction towards the upper part.</t1886> <t1887>In those two contractions lay, precisely, the only visible alteration in that face.</t1887> <t1888>The nostrils sometimes remained contracted, while on some occasions, dilations followed contractions, but in either case, they gave the face an unpleasant expression of cruelty and perfidy.</t1888> <t1889>Upon careful examination of that face, it was not difficult to observe that the expression of cruelty was due to the lines of his mouth and the excessively fine and horizontal eye sockets.</t1889> <t1890>It cannot be denied, however, that that face was extraordinarily beautiful.</t1890>
<t1891>Its owner descended the palace stairs and went out to the vestibule, where his carriage was waiting for him.</t1891> <t1892>Few had spoken to him during the reception, and the gentleman could have been more affectionate than he was when he arrived at the place where he remained withdrawn and separated from the groups.</t1892> <t1893>Without stopping for a moment, he got into his carriage, and the horses set off at a gallop, scattering the people they encountered along the way.</t1893> <t1894>The coachman drove as if he were charging against an enemy army, without his master thinking to curb the coachman's reckless fury, which, far from angering him, seemed rather to please him.</t1894> <t1895>Sometimes, very rarely, complaints had been voiced, even in that insensitive city and in that age of ignorance and idiocy, against the barbaric custom of galloping through narrow, sidewalk-less streets, without regard for the unfortunate people who were often run over, but no one deigned to give a second of attention to such trifles, and in this matter, as in many others, the wretched lower class was left free to deal with the difficulty as best they could.</t1895>
<t1896>With deafening noise and inhuman disregard for the most sacred considerations, difficult to comprehend in our days, the carriage flew down the street, bouncing over the cobblestones and turning corners with inconceivable speed, scaring away the women, who screamed in terror, the children, who ran like frightened rabbits, and the men who tried to stick to the walls.</t1896> <t1897>At the moment the carriage turned a corner near a fountain, one of the wheels jumped, hundreds of throats let out a scream, and the horses reared and backed up.</t1897>
<t1898>It is almost certain that the carriage would have continued its unperturbed, reckless race if it hadn't been for this last inconvenience, as it was what carriages used to do in that happy era, even if they left the street strewn with corpses, why would they do otherwise? But the frightened footman had jumped to the ground and twenty hands grabbed the horses' reins at once.</t1898>
<t1899>—What's happening?—asked the gentleman, poking his calm face through the door.</t1899>
<t1900>A tall man, with a cap on his head, had taken a bundle from between the horses' legs, which he placed on the base of a fountain, and leaning over it, howled like a wild animal.</t1900>
<t1901>—Excuse me, Mr. Marquis—said a ragged individual with a humble voice and demeanor,—it's a child.</t1901>
<t1902>—And why is he making that deafening noise?</t1902> <t1903>You say it's a child?</t1903>
<t1904>—Excuse me, Mr. Marquis...</t1904> <t1905>It is a... shame... yes, that's it.</t1905>
<t1906>The fountain was a few yards away.</t1906> <t1907>The tall man who was leaning over the bundle suddenly straightened up and ran hurriedly towards the carriage, causing the Marquis to place his hand on the hilt of his sword.</t1907>
<t1908>—Dead!—roared the tall man with signs of savage despair, fixing his eyes on the Marquis and raising both arms.</t1908><t1909>—Murdered!</t1909>
<t1910>The crowds gathered around the carriage.</t1910> <t1911>All eyes were focused on the person of the Marquis, but in them, nothing could be read but anxiety, fear, no anger or threat.</t1911> <t1912>Everyone was silent.</t1912> <t1913>After the first shout, an imposing silence followed.</t1913> <t1914>The voice of the one who had spoken to the magnate remained extremely submissive.</t1914> <t1915>The Marquis cast his eyes over the huddled groups, regarding them with the indifference with which he would have looked at a herd of frightened rats.</t1915>
<t1916>Without changing his stance, he took out a pocket.</t1916>
<t1917>—It surprises me greatly—he said—that you can't even take care of your own children.</t1917> <t1918>Frequently, you cross my path in a way that cannot help but be bothersome to me.</t1918> <t1919>Don't you realize that your recklessness could harm my horses? Come on!...</t1919> <t1920>Give him this!</t1920>
<t1921>Accompanying the action with the word, he threw a gold coin at the lackey's feet.</t1921>
<t1922>—Dead... murdered!—the tall man shouted again.</t1922>
<t1923>Another man arrived at that moment, to whom everyone made way.</t1923> <t1924>The one who had just shouted fell into his arms as soon as he saw him, remaining there for a long time, crying and sobbing.</t1924>
<t1925>—I know everything... I know everything—said the newcomer.</t1925><t1926>—Courage, Gaspar!</t1926> <t1927>It is preferable to die as the child did than to live the life that awaited him.</t1927> <t1928>He died without pain, without suffering, and on the other hand, had he continued living, those would have relentlessly pursued him.</t1928>
<t1929>—You are a philosopher—said the Marquis, smiling.</t1929><t1930>—What is your name?</t1930>
<t1931>—Defarge.</t1931>
<t1932>—What is your occupation?</t1932>
<t1933>—I am a wine seller, Mr. Marquis.</t1933>
<t1934>—Take this, philosopher and wine seller, and spend it as you please—replied the Marquis, throwing another gold coin at his feet.</t1934><t1935>—Let's see!</t1935> <t1936>Are the horses ready?</t1936>
<t1937>Without deigning to look at the crowds a second time, the Marquis settled back into his seat.</t1937> <t1938>The carriage began to move again and its happy occupant had forgotten the incident, as if he had just broken a trinket and paid for it, when his Olympian serenity was disturbed by the violent entry of a gold coin into the interior of the carriage.</t1938>
<t1939>—Stop!—shouted the Marquis.</t1939><t1940>—Stop the horses!... Who threw this?</t1940>
<t1941>He looked angrily at the spot where he had just left Defarge, but saw nothing more than the unfortunate father embracing the corpse of his son, and a woman standing, who was looking at him with a frown.</t1941>
<t1942>—Dogs!—murmured the Marquis.</t1942><t1943>—I would gladly run over all of you to rid the world of your disgusting presence!</t1943> <t1944>If I knew who the scoundrel was that threw the coin, and had him close enough, by God, I would crush him under the wheels of my carriage!</t1944>
<t1945>Such was the fear of the mobs, so great the horror they felt for what men of the Marquis's social class could do to them, within and outside the law, that not a voice, nor a hand, nor a glance was raised.</t1945> <t1946>All the men remained silent, their eyes fixed on the ground.</t1946> <t1947>Only the woman we referred to earlier dared to fix her angry gaze on the Marquis, who did not even notice her.</t1947> <t1948>His lofty gaze passed over her head and over the other rats, and comfortably settled on the plush cushions of his carriage, he ordered the coachman to continue the journey.</t1948>
<t1949>Through the same place, many other carriages crossed in a frenzied race and rapid succession.</t1949> <t1950>The one of the minister, the one of the state arbiters, the one of the general overseer, the one of the doctor, the one of the lawyer, the one of the clergyman.</t1950> <t1951>The rats timidly poked their heads out at the entrance of their holes.</t1951>
<t1952>The father, who had been left without a son, withdrew; the rats retreated to the depths of their holes, and on the base of the fountain, there remained only the woman who had dared to look sternly at the Marquis, rigid as Fate.</t1952> <t1953>The water of the fountain flowed murmuring, the waters of the river ran fast and turbulent, the day was running to its end, the life of the city was running to death driven by Time, which waits for no one, the rats were already sleeping in their dark holes, the dance of extravagance continued among lights and dinners, and all things, to put it once and for all, continued their course.</t1953>
<t1954>VIII.</t1954>
<t1955>THE LORD IN THE FIELD</t1955>
<t1956>A charming landscape, where wheat fields can be seen, although not abundant.</t1956> <t1957>Pieces of land sown with rye where wheat could have been grown, pieces sown with beans and peas, pieces sown with vegetables of all kinds, and it is that inanimate nature, harmonizing its tastes with those of humanity, showed a decided tendency towards vegetation that was more apparent than real.</t1957>
<t1958>The travel carriage of the Marquis, which, by the way, could have been less heavy, drawn by four horses and guided by two postilions, was laboriously climbing a steep hill.</t1958> <t1959>The high color of the nobleman's cheeks did not argue against his high lineage.</t1959> <t1960>Its origin was not internal, but rather the effect of an unavoidable external circumstance: the sunset.</t1960>
<t1961>The tangential rays of the sun penetrated the travel coach of the Marquis, enveloping him in halos of reddish light.</t1961>
<t1962>—Soon it will be ready—exclaimed Mr. Marquis, looking at his hands with disgust.</t1962>
<t1963>Indeed, the sun was so close to its setting that it soon went down.</t1963> <t1964>Having reached the top of the hill and with the heavy brakes applied to the wheels, as soon as the carriage began to roll down the slope, enveloped in clouds of dust, the reddish gleams faded: the sun and the Marquis were descending.</t1964>
<t1965>Before the eyes of the Marquis stretched a broken territory, a village at the bottom of the hollow, a plain that ended in a hillock, a bell tower, a windmill, a forest abundant in game, and a fortress perched on the edge of a cliff.</t1965> <t1966>The Marquis gazed at all the detailed objects, whose lines began to blur in the shadows of the night, with the expression of someone approaching their home.</t1966>
<t1967>The village had a poor street, a poor brewery, a poor tannery, a poor tavern, a poor post relay, and a poor fountain.</t1967> <t1968>Since all the services were poor, the inhabitants had to be poor, and indeed they were poor.</t1968> <t1969>They all lived in misery, and many were sitting at the doors of their homes, preparing discarded onions and other similar items for their dinner, while others washed vegetables, herbs, and all kinds of edibles that the earth provides at the fountain.</t1969> <t1970>It was not necessary to be very astute to discover the causes that reduced them to misery: just reading the solemn inscriptions placed in all visible spots of the village, detailing the taxes to be paid to the State, the Church, and the lord, along with local and general contributions, was more than enough, not only to understand why the inhabitants were poor, but to marvel that hunger and misery had not ended all their lives.</t1970>
<t1971>Very few children were seen, not a single dog.</t1971> <t1972>As for the men and women, the choice the world offered them could not have been clearer: either live in the most miserable way in the village, under the crushing yoke of the lord, or die in the fortress perched on the cliff, destined to be a dungeon.</t1972>
<t1973>Preceded by a mail coach and accompanied by the cracks of the postillions' whips, which sliced through the air like coiled serpents, the Marquis ordered his carriage to stop in front of the coaching inn's door.</t1973> <t1974>Since it was very close to the fountain, the villagers who were there paused their tasks to look at him.</t1974> <t1975>He also looked at them and saw how they bowed their heads before him, in the same manner he had bowed his own before the lord, when a road worker happened to join the group.</t1975>
<t1976>—Bring me that individual—said the Marquis to the messenger.</t1976>
<t1977>The road worker was brought before him, around whom the villagers gathered, eager to listen and see.</t1977>
<t1978>—Did I pass you on the way, right?</t1978>
<t1979>—It is true, sir, I had the honor of the gentleman passing me on the road.</t1979>
<t1980>—Upon climbing the ramp and at the top of the hill, isn't it true?</t1980>
<t1981>—Sir, it is true.</t1981>
<t1982>—What were you staring at so intently?</t1982>
<t1983>—I was watching the man, sir.</t1983>
<t1984>When he answered, his pointed hat was pointing under the carriage.</t1984> <t1985>All the villagers focused their gazes on the same spot.</t1985>
<t1986>—What man, you piece of brute?</t1986>
<t1987>—Excuse me, sir, I mean the man who was hanging from the chain of the winch.</t1987>
<t1988>—But who?</t1988>
<t1989>—The man, sir.</t1989>
<t1990>—Let the devil take this mob of idiots!</t1990> <t1991>What is that man's name?</t1991> <t1992>You know everyone around here: who was that man?</t1992>
<t1993>—Mercy, sir!</t1993> <t1994>He was not from this part of the country: I had never seen him in my life.</t1994>
<t1995>—Suspended from the chain? Hanged?</t1995>
<t1996>—With the gentleman's permission, I will say that his head was hanging like this.</t1996>
<t1997>The truck driver approached the rail and positioned himself with his face turned towards the sky and his head hanging down.</t1997> <t1998>Then, he returned to a normal posture and made a bow.</t1998>
<t1999>—What did he look like?</t1999>
<t2000>—Sir, he was whiter than a miller, the dust covered him from head to toe, he was whiter than a specter and taller than a specter.</t2000>
<t2001>The description produced an immense sensation in the audience.</t2001> <t2002>Everyone turned their eyes towards the Marquis, perhaps believing that he carried some specter on his conscience.</t2002>
<t2003>—It cannot be denied that you have behaved like a man!—exclaimed the Marquis.</t2003><t2004>—You see a thief climbing into my carriage, and you don't know how to open that huge mouth you have on your face.</t2004> <t2005>Let him go, Mr. Gambelle, let him go!</t2005>
<t2006>Mr. Gambelle was the head of the post office and other services, and as the scene we are describing unfolded, in his desire to contribute to the successful outcome of the statement, he had grabbed the declarant by the arm.</t2006>
<t2007>—Release that scoundrel, Mr. Gambelle, and if the stranger arrives at the village, arrest him and do not set him free until you are sure he is an honest man.</t2007>
<t2008>—It will be an honor for me to follow the gentleman's orders—replied Gambelle.</t2008>
<t2009>—Did that one escape...?</t2009> <t2010>But where has that damn one gone?</t2010>
<t2011>The damned one had gotten under the carriage, accompanied by half a dozen of his particular friends, to whom he was showing the chain of the gauge.</t2011> <t2012>Another half dozen friends immediately dragged him out and took him to the presence of the lord.</t2012>
<t2013>—Did that man escape when we stopped to throw the stone?</t2013>
<t2014>—He plunged headfirst from the top of the hill, just as if he had thrown himself into the sea.</t2014>
<t2015>—Make sure to find that out for me, Gambelle... Move out!</t2015>
<t2016>In front of the wheels, examining the chain, were the half-dozen close friends of the trucker, resembling a flock of sheep.</t2016> <t2017>The wheels began to turn so unexpectedly that it was a miracle they managed to save their skins and bones, the only things they could save, fortunately for them.</t2017>
<t2018>The horses left the village at a gallop, but soon slowed down, as the hill's slope was so steep that they had to climb it at a walk.</t2018> <t2019>The road bordered a small cemetery, where a cross with the image of Our Savior could be seen.</t2019> <t2020>It was a wooden image, made by unskilled hands, but the artist had studied from life and surely his model was his own body or that of one of his fellow villagers, as the image was horribly thin and gaunt.</t2020>
<t2021>At the foot of that sorrowful emblem of immense misfortune, there was a woman kneeling.</t2021> <t2022>She turned her head upon hearing the noise of the carriage, quickly stood up, and hurriedly ran towards the coach.</t2022>
<t2023>—It's the gentleman!—he exclaimed, appearing at the door.</t2023><t2024>—Sir, a favor!</t2024>
<t2025>The gentleman let out an exclamation of impatience.</t2025>
<t2026>—What's up? What do you need? Always with requests!</t2026>
<t2027>—Sir, for the love of God!</t2027> <t2028>My husband... the forest ranger!...</t2028>
<t2029>—What does your husband, the forest ranger, want?</t2029> <t2030>These people always ask for the same thing!</t2030> <t2031>That he can't pay, huh?</t2031>
<t2032>—He has paid for everything, sir!</t2032> <t2033>He is dead!</t2033>
<t2034>—Better! That way he will rest! Do you think I can return it to you?</t2034>
<t2035>—Alas, sir... I know all too well that it's not true!</t2035> <t2036>But he rests over there... under those wretched grasses!...</t2036>
<t2037>—And well?</t2037>
<t2038>—That there are many stretches of land covered with grass.</t2038>
<t2039>—Well... so what?</t2039>
<t2040>That woman was young, although she seemed old.</t2040> <t2041>Her face reflected immense pain.</t2041> <t2042>Sometimes she energetically twisted her calloused hands, and other times she placed them on the carriage door, caressing it tenderly, as if she believed it was a human chest capable of being softened.</t2042>
<t2043>—May the lord have compassion on me!</t2043> <t2044>Listen to my plea!</t2044> <t2045>My husband has died of hunger... from the same illness that has taken so many others... from the same one that will take all of us in the village to the grave...</t2045>
<t2046>—But what are you telling me for?</t2046> <t2047>Can I possibly feed all of you?</t2047>
<t2048>—Sir...</t2048> <t2049>God knows it, but it is not food that I ask for.</t2049> <t2050>The only thing I desire is that over the earth that covers my husband's corpse, a piece of wood or stone with his name on it be raised, so that everyone knows where he is buried.</t2050> <t2051>If not, soon everyone will forget the place and they won't be able to bury me next to him when I die.</t2051> <t2052>Sir!... Sir!...</t2052>
<t2053>The lackey had separated the poor woman from the carriage, the horses had started a long trot, and the gentleman saw the league or two of distance that still separated him from his château rapidly diminish.</t2053>
<t2054>The road was good, and the time spent traveling it was not long.</t2054> <t2055>The shadows of a huge building and many very large trees were outlined.</t2055> <t2056>It was the château of the Marquis, at whose main door the butler was waiting for him.</t2056>
<t2057>—Has Mr. Carlos, whom I am expecting, arrived from England?—he asked.</t2057>
<t2058>—Not yet, Mr. Marquis—was the response.</t2058>
<t2059>IX.</t2059>
<t2060>THE HEAD OF GORGON</t2060>
<t2061>The château of the Marquis was an arrogant building, with thick and solid walls and vast proportions.</t2061> <t2062>From its spacious stone courtyard, two wide stone staircases started, which met at the stone terrace, like everything else, that preceded the main door.</t2062> <t2063>The sturdy balustrades were made of stone, the vases were made of stone, the flowers were made of stone, the human faces were made of stone, the heads of the lions were made of stone, everything was made of stone.</t2063> <t2064>It seemed as if the head of Gorgon had presided, two centuries earlier, over the completion of that immense mass of stone and had devised its finishes and ornamental details.</t2064>
<t2065>The torch that preceded the Marquis when, after getting out of his travel carriage, he began the ascent of the spacious stone staircase, shed enough light to provoke the protests of the owl that had its headquarters on the roof of the turret that crowned the stables and rose as if trying to scale the clouds, surrounded by trees of prodigious height.</t2065> <t2066>Everything else remained quiet, so quiet that both the torch that preceded the Marquis on the grand staircase and the one that awaited his arrival in front of the honor door burned as if they were in the center of a closed room, and not exposed to the night breezes.</t2066> <t2067>Nor was any other noise heard except for the hooting of the owl, with the exception of the sound produced by the water from the fountain as it fell into the basin, for it was one of those nights that hold their breath for entire hours, only to exhale a sigh and remain breathless once again.</t2067>
<t2068>The door of honor swung on its smooth hinges, and the Marquis entered a gallery whose walls displayed a great variety of ancient armor, and an abundance of darts, spears, swords, and hunting knives, along with a varied assortment of riding crops, whips, and lashes, whose weight more than one peasant had felt when their lord was enraged.</t2068>
<t2069>Without even glancing at the large wings, shrouded in black darkness, the Marquis, always following the torch, arrived in front of a door at the end of the gallery.</t2069> <t2070>Once it was opened, he found himself in his rooms, which were three, one of them his bedroom.</t2070> <t2071>The rooms with high coffered ceilings, gathered all the luxury, all the refinement that befits a Marquis, who lives in a sumptuous century and in a nation that sacrifices everything to pomp.</t2071> <t2072>In the extremely rich furniture, the taste of the penultimate Louis of that sacred dynasty that was meant to be eternal, Louis XIV, predominated, although there were also objects that could pass as illustrations from the ancient pages of French history.</t2072>
<t2073>In the center of the third room, a round chamber corresponding to one of the four towers flanking the building, there was a dining table set for two people.</t2073> <t2074>The room was small, and its window was open, although its shutters were closed.</t2074>
<t2075>—A place setting for my nephew?—murmured the Marquis upon entering.</t2075><t2076>—And yet, they just told me he hasn't arrived yet.</t2076>
<t2077>He had not arrived, indeed, but at the castle, they were expecting him to arrive with the Marquis.</t2077>
<t2078>—It is unlikely that he will arrive tonight—added the Marquis, addressing the servant in charge of the dining room—but leave the table as it is.</t2078> <t2079>In a quarter of an hour, I will sit down to dinner.</t2079>
<t2080>Indeed: fifteen minutes later, the Marquis took a seat in front of a sumptuous and select dinner.</t2080> <t2081>He sat with his back to the window.</t2081> <t2082>He had just finished eating the soup and was raising a glass of fine Bordeaux to his lips when he lowered his hand without drinking.</t2082>
<t2083>—What is that?—he asked calmly, turning his face towards the lattices.</t2083>
<t2084>—What, Monseñor?</t2084>
<t2085>—Get out... Open the shutters.</t2085>
<t2086>The order was obeyed immediately.</t2086>
<t2087>—What's up?</t2087>
<t2088>—Nothing, sir: the treetops and the shadows of the night are the only things that can be seen.</t2088>
<t2089>—Alright—said his master, with unshakable calm.</t2089><t2090>—Close it again.</t2090>
<t2091>The Marquis turned his attention back to his dinner.</t2091> <t2092>He had reached about halfway through it when, for the second time, the glass he was raising to his lips stopped midway.</t2092> <t2093>The sound of a carriage rolling at a good pace could be heard approaching the castle.</t2093>
<t2094>—Ask who has arrived—said the Marquis to the servant.</t2094>
<t2095>He was the nephew of the gentleman, to whom at the post house they had indicated that the Marquis would have already arrived at the castle.</t2095>
<t2096>—Go and tell him on my behalf that dinner is waiting, and that I beg him to come without delay.</t2096>
<t2097>Minutes later, the traveler entered the dining room, who was the same young man we have known in England under the name of Charles Darnay.</t2097>
<t2098>The Marquis received him with exquisite courtesy, but they did not shake hands.</t2098>
<t2099>—Did you leave Paris yesterday?—asked the young man as he sat down at the table.</t2099>
<t2100>—Yesterday, yes; and you?</t2100>
<t2101>—I came directly here.</t2101>
<t2102>—From London?</t2102>
<t2103>—Yes.</t2103>
<t2104>"It took you quite a while to get here," observed the Marquis, smiling.</t2104>
<t2105>—On the contrary, I made the trip very quickly.</t2105>
<t2106>—Excuse me, I didn't mean to say that you spent a lot of time on the road, but rather in deciding to make the trip.</t2106>
<t2107>—Yes... I have been forced to postpone it... various business matters.</t2107>
<t2108>—I suppose so—replied the uncle.</t2108>
<t2109>They exchanged no more words while the servant was present.</t2109> <t2110>Once the coffee was served, and uncle and nephew were alone, the latter started the conversation, fixing his eyes on the face of the former, which seemed like a mask.</t2110>
<t2111>—I have returned, uncle, pursuing the same goal that forced me to leave.</t2111> <t2112>I have faced immense danger; but the goal is so sacred that even if death had befallen me, my courage would not have faltered.</t2112>
<t2113>—Not death, dear—replied the uncle;—that lady should not even be named.</t2113>
<t2114>—I highly doubt, uncle—replied the nephew,—that you would have extended a hand to me, even seeing me placed on the very edge of death.</t2114>
<t2115>The uncle's nostrils flared and the lines on his face deepened, giving his appearance a more cruel expression; but the Marquis made a graceful gesture of protest, which was not at all reassuring due to its overly palpable effect of the nobleman's refined manners.</t2115>
<t2116>—Speaking frankly—replied the nephew,—if my information is correct, you have done everything possible to give weight to the suspicions arising from the overly suspicious circumstances that surrounded me.</t2116>
<t2117>—No, no, no, no!—replied the uncle, laughing.</t2117>
<t2118>—We will not discuss that point—continued the nephew, looking at his interlocutor with evident distrust.</t2118><t2119>—I am aware that, in exchange for stopping me on the way, you will exhaust all the resources of your special diplomacy, just as I am also aware that in terms of resources, you are not very scrupulous.</t2119>
<t2120>—My dear nephew, I will allow myself to beg you to try to remember, to keep in mind what I told you a long time ago, a very long time ago.</t2120>
<t2121>—I remember it perfectly.</t2121>
<t2122>—Thank you very much—replied the Marquis, with a voice that sounded like a musical instrument.</t2122>
<t2123>—Indeed, uncle; I firmly believe that I owe it to his bad luck, and to my good star, that I am not currently confined in some prison in France.</t2123>
<t2124>—I don't quite understand—replied the uncle, taking a sip of coffee.</t2124><t2125>—Would you be so kind as to explain?</t2125>
<t2126>—With great pleasure.</t2126> <t2127>I mean to say that, had you not fallen into disgrace at court, had you not been under the dark shadow of that cloud that has been enveloping you for some years, I would not have lacked a lettre de cachet that would have opened the doors of a fortress for me indefinitely.</t2127>
<t2128>—It is very possible—replied the uncle, with unshakable calm—that the honor of the family might have driven me to bother you to that extent.</t2128>
<t2129>—Fortunately for me, I observe that at the reception the day before yesterday you encountered the same coldness as always—said the nephew.</t2129>
<t2130>—Forgive me for saying, my dear nephew, that I, in your place, would not assert that my misfortune at court is a fortune for you.</t2130> <t2131>It is very likely that the reflections that solitude in a jail would have suggested to you would have had a more beneficial influence on your future destiny than your actions enjoying freedom.</t2131> <t2132>But it is useless to discuss this matter.</t2132> <t2133>I find myself, as you say, in a disadvantageous position.</t2133> <t2134>Today, only interest or importunities achieve those small instruments of correction, those gentle means to strengthen the power and honor of families, those insignificant favors that could have bothered you so much.</t2134> <t2135>So many covet them, and so few (comparatively) obtain them!</t2135> <t2136>It was not like this in the past, but things have changed a lot, and they change every day, and it is noteworthy that they go from bad to worse.</t2136> <t2137>Our ancestors enjoyed the power of life and death over their vassals and common people.</t2137> <t2138>How many of those dogs have left this very room to be hanged immediately!</t2138> <t2139>As far as I know, in my bedroom an insolent rogue who dared to utter some tasteless joke about his daughter was stabbed to death...</t2139> <t2140>We have lost many privileges; that is the truth.</t2140> <t2141>A new philosophy has come into fashion, and I cannot deny that today, if we insisted on defending all our rights, we might encounter serious inconveniences.</t2141> <t2142>Things are getting bad, very bad!</t2142>
<t2143>The Marquis took a pinch of snuff and shook his head with the expression of someone who regrets that a country disregards such excellent means of regeneration.</t2143>
<t2144>—In such a way we have asserted our social position, both in past times and in our days—replied the nephew with a somber tone,—that we have managed to make France pronounce our names with aversion and hatred.</t2144>
<t2145>—Which we should congratulate ourselves for—observed the uncle.</t2145><t2146>—Aversion and hatred are the highest and most involuntary tributes that the small pay to the great.</t2146>
<t2147>—I do not find a single face in this country that looks at us with deference—replied the nephew.</t2147><t2148>—In all of them, I read the respect engendered by fear and slavery.</t2148>
<t2149>"—Which is not without flattery for the family and for the methods employed by the family to sustain its grandeur," said the Marquis, taking another pinch of snuff and crossing one leg over the other.</t2149>
<t2150>The illustrious man affected a glacial indifference; but when his nephew, with his elbows on the table, covered his eyes with his hands and remained absorbed in his reflections for a considerable amount of time, the Marquis's mask disappeared and he glanced sideways at his nephew with such an expression of rancor that it clashed severely with his initial indifference.</t2150>
<t2151>—The only philosophy with lasting effects is repression—observed the Marquis.</t2151><t2152>—That somber respect engendered by fear and slavery, my friend, will make the dogs remain obedient to the whip as long as this roof protects us from the elements.</t2152>
<t2153>Perhaps the roof was destined to collapse sooner than the good Marquis believed.</t2153> <t2154>If that night they had shown him a picture of what his castle would be like in a few years, and hundreds of castles similar to his, surely no one would have made him believe in the fidelity of the painting.</t2154>
<t2155>—In the meantime—continued the Marquis,—it is my responsibility to safeguard the honor and peace of our family, whether you want it or not...</t2155> <t2156>But now I realize you must be exhausted: shall we end our discussion for tonight?</t2156>
<t2157>—One more moment.</t2157>
<t2158>—One hour, if that's your preference.</t2158>
<t2159>—We have acted wrongly, uncle, and the fruits of our iniquity are ripening.</t2159>
<t2160>—Have we done wrong?—repeated the uncle, smiling.</t2160>
<t2161>—Our family has committed a thousand errors, yes, our honorable family, whose honor is so important to both of us.</t2161> <t2162>Even in my father's time, we committed a thousand iniquities, sacrificing without hesitation any human being who stood between us and our pleasures...</t2162> <t2163>But why speak of my father's time, when the same happens in yours?</t2163> <t2164>Can I, perhaps, establish a separation between my father and his twin brother, his joint heir, his immediate and inevitable successor?</t2164>
<t2165>—The hand of death called me to succeed it.</t2165>
<t2166>—And the same hand left me chained to a system that repulses me, that horrifies me, making me responsible for what is beyond my control to prevent; it prevents me from fulfilling the final plea murmured by the lips of my saintly mother, it prevents me from obeying the last, silent, but pathetic order dictated by the beloved eyes of that exemplary lady, who urged me to have pity and compassion, and to never close my ears to the voice of justice; and finally, it tears my soul apart, convincing me that I need a hand to help me and that I seek it in vain.</t2166>
<t2167>—If you seek it in me, my dear nephew, I assure you that you are wasting your time: you will never find it.</t2167> <t2168>I have decided to go to the grave perpetuating the system under which I was born and have lived.</t2168>
<t2169>He took another pinch of snuff, put the little box back in his pocket, and added:</t2169>
<t2170>—It is preferable to listen to the voice of reason and accept the natural destiny...</t2170> <t2171>But I observe that you are lost, my dear Carlos.</t2171>
<t2172>—Lost to me are these properties and even France—replied the nephew bitterly.</t2172><t2173>—I renounce them.</t2173>
<t2174>—But can you renounce them?</t2174> <t2175>I've always believed that to renounce, one must first possess.</t2175> <t2176>I don't know if France is yours yet; but the assets of our family...</t2176> <t2177>Of course, it's hardly worth talking about; but do you consider them yours?</t2177>
<t2178>—When I spoke as I did, it never occurred to me to allude to the rights I have over them, much less to claim their possession.</t2178> <t2179>If tomorrow they were to pass from your hands to mine...</t2179>
<t2180>—What I have the vanity to consider very unlikely...</t2180>
<t2181>—... Or twenty years from now...</t2181>
<t2182>—You give me too much credit; but I prefer this assumption to the first.</t2182>
<t2183>—I would abandon them, to live elsewhere and a different kind of life.</t2183> <t2184>It wouldn't be much of an abandonment!</t2184> <t2185>After all, a dreadful desert that presents nothing but miseries and ruins!</t2185>
<t2186>—Yes?—exclaimed the Marquis, casting his gaze around that sumptuous room.</t2186>
<t2187>—I will not say that the sight does not find some attraction in those; but when studied in their essence, in the light of reason and justice, they are a crumbling tower of extortions, wastefulness, debts, injustices, oppressions, hunger, nakedness, and suffering.</t2187>
<t2188>—Yes?—repeated the Marquis with a tone of satisfaction.</t2188>
<t2189>—If they come to be mine, I will entrust them to more competent hands than mine so that they can gradually be relieved, if I arrive in time, from the enormous weight that drags them to the precipice, so that the unfortunate ones who are tied to them suffer less in the future.</t2189> <t2190>I won't be able to do it; I know.</t2190> <t2191>A curse weighs upon them, and not only upon them but also upon the entire nation.</t2191>
<t2192>—And you?—asked the uncle.</t2192><t2193>—Pardon my curiosity; do you expect to live off the manna from heaven under the shadow of your newly minted philosophy?</t2193>
<t2194>—I will have to live on the same thing that so many of my fellow countrymen live on, no matter how many their credentials, no matter how ancient their nobility: work.</t2194>
<t2195>—In England, for example?</t2195>
<t2196>—Yes.</t2196> <t2197>The honor of the family can sleep peacefully.</t2197> <t2198>I will not tarnish it by working while I am in this country, and I will not be able to tarnish it in another simply because, outside of here, I will not bear the family name.</t2198>
<t2199>The Marquis rang a bell.</t2199> <t2200>Immediately, the adjacent room lit up.</t2200> <t2201>The Marquis waited for the servant who had turned on the lights to leave, and when he heard the footsteps receding, he said, looking at his nephew with a smiling face:</t2201>
<t2202>—England has many attractions for you, although, to be honest, I'm not surprised considering how much you have prospered there.</t2202>
<t2203>—I have already expressed that I believe I owe you all the fortunes and prosperities I found there.</t2203> <t2204>In any case, England is my refuge.</t2204>
<t2205>—If we are to believe the vain Englishmen, it is the refuge of many.</t2205> <t2206>Do you know of a compatriot of ours who sought refuge there?</t2206> <t2207>I am referring to a doctor.</t2207>
<t2208>—I know him.</t2208>
<t2209>—Whom does a daughter accompany?</t2209>
<t2210>—Yes.</t2210>
<t2211>—The same one.</t2211> <t2212>You're exhausted... Good night.</t2212>
<t2213>The smile with which he accompanied the nod of his head that he made to his nephew as a courteous farewell and the tone with which he pronounced the last words, enveloped a mystery that could not help but impress the nephew.</t2213>
<t2214>—Yes—repeated the Marquis.</t2214><t2215>—A doctor with a daughter... Yes.</t2215> <t2216>This is how the new philosophy begins!...</t2216> <t2217>Good night.</t2217>
<t2218>The young man fixed his eyes on her face as if he expected to find in it the explanation of the last words that had hurt his ears.</t2218> <t2219>A wasted effort.</t2219> <t2220>He would have achieved the same by questioning the faces of the stone statues that were so abundant in the castle.</t2220>
<t2221>—Good night!—added the uncle.</t2221><t2222>—The desire to see you tomorrow morning will keep me awake all night...</t2222> <t2223>Rest well...</t2223> <t2224>Turn on the lights in my dear nephew's bedroom...</t2224> <t2225>And roast my dear nephew in bed, if you can!—he added to himself, before ringing the bell again, calling the valet to his room.</t2225>
<t2226>The valet answered the call and went out again, leaving the Marquis in his underwear and ready to get into bed.</t2226> <t2227>It took him a few minutes to do so.</t2227> <t2228>If someone had seen him dressed as he was and wearing slippers, pacing the room with a silent and lively step, similar to that of a royal tiger, they would probably have taken him for the famous enchanted marquis of legend, whose periodic transformations into a feline were either beginning then or ending at that moment.</t2228>
<t2229>In the depths of his imagination, while he walked from one end of his voluptuous chamber to the other, the most striking incidents of the journey that had ended that night emerged: he saw himself lazily climbing the steep slope of the hill, contemplating with the eyes of his soul the sunset, the descent of the opposite side of the hill, the mill, the chain of the galga, the prison situated at the edge of the cliff, the village in the hollow, the peasants around the fountain, and the road worker at the moment of pointing with his pointed cap to the chain of his road coach.</t2229> <t2230>The village fountain reminded him of the other fountain in Paris, and in it he saw the corpse of the child curled up on the base, the women bent over his little body, and the tall man who, with arms outstretched, shouted: "Dead!"</t2230>
<t2231>—I'm getting cold—murmured Mr. Marqués.</t2231><t2232>—To bed, to bed!</t2232>
<t2233>He lay down on the bed, let the luxurious curtains fall around him, and prepared to sleep.</t2233>
<t2234>For the span of three endless hours, the stone faces of the motionless sentinels placed outside the castle gazed into the darkness of the night; for the span of three endless hours, the restless horses struck the mangers in the stables with their hooves, and the owl emitted a peculiar sound that bore no resemblance to the song that men-poets have attributed to owls.</t2234>
<t2235>Men and stone lions of the castle fixed their pupil-less eyes on the black veils of the night for the span of three mortal hours.</t2235> <t2236>Black were the fields, black the forests, black the roads, black like a sea of ink the entire landscape.</t2236> <t2237>In the village cemetery, it would have been impossible to distinguish one grave from another, and no one could have said whether the cross at whose foot the woman who asked a favor from the Marquis had knelt that afternoon was still standing or had fallen down.</t2237> <t2238>In the village, exploiters and exploited slept deeply.</t2238> <t2239>Perhaps during sleep, the latter enjoyed sumptuous banquets, as often happens to those who perish from hunger, or tranquility and rest, like oxen accustomed to groaning under the yoke.</t2239>
<t2240>Invisible and silent waters flowed from the village fountain, just like from the castle fountain, disappearing into the distance, like the minutes that continuously slip away from the hand of Time.</t2240> <t2241>After three endless hours, the waters began to take on light gray tones, and the eyes of the stone faces of the castle started to light up.</t2241>
<t2242>The sun rose in the East, tinting the treetops and mountain peaks red.</t2242> <t2243>Its gleams gave a red hue to the waters that sprang from the castle's fountain and to the stone faces of men and lions.</t2243> <t2244>The birds chirped talkatively, one of which, bolder than its companions, exhausted the repertoire of its most beautiful songs perched on the stone windowsill of the Marquis's chamber.</t2244> <t2245>The nearest stone sentinel watched the singer with mute astonishment, opened its mouth, and showed signs of the deepest terror.</t2245>
<t2246>The gleams of the day star shook off the drowsiness that reigned as an absolute lord in the village.</t2246> <t2247>Windows were opened, doors of the houses were unbarred, and people went out shivering into the street to engage in their daily tasks.</t2247> <t2248>Some went to the fountain, others to the field; some to plow, others to dig or to graze emaciated livestock.</t2248> <t2249>In the church, two or three people remained, pleading with Heaven to preserve the life of some cow or a small number of sheep.</t2249>
<t2250>The castle woke up later, as befitted its high social rank.</t2250> <t2251>The sun's rays first tinged the spears, swords, and lances red; later they sparked off the swords, windows began to open, the horses in the stables grew restless, and the dogs shook the chains that held them, barking wildly in demand of freedom.</t2251>
<t2252>All these were trivial incidents that repeated daily, routine details of ordinary life.</t2252> <t2253>But something less trivial, something that was neither routine nor ordinary, was happening that morning in the castle.</t2253> <t2254>The great bell was ringing with insistent fury; servants were running from one place to another; many people were crossing the terrace and in the stables, several horses were being saddled with agitation.</t2254> <t2255>Why?</t2255>
<t2256>What sudden impulse had seized the road worker, moments before engrossed in his work, up there on the hilltop?</t2256> <t2257>Were the birds of the field trying to snatch away the meager lunch he had left on a pile of stones? Why was he running with such fury, downhill, as if his life depended on the speed of his race?</t2257> <t2258>Why did he sink his legs up to the knee in the dust, and devour distances without stopping to catch his breath, until he reached the fountain?</t2258>
<t2259>Around it, the entire population of the village had gathered, and there they remained with consternation painted on their faces, speaking in very low voices, though without revealing any emotions other than those of somber curiosity and deep surprise.</t2259> <t2260>At the mouth of the street, people from the castle, servants from the post house, and all the village authorities, more or less armed, could be seen.</t2260> <t2261>The road worker had already penetrated the center of a group, formed by about fifty of his close friends, with whom he spoke with signs of excitement.</t2261> <t2262>What did all this mean?</t2262> <t2263>Above all, what did the arrival of Mr. Gambelle mean, who, seated on the back of a horse also ridden by a servant from the castle, was approaching the village at full gallop, despite the double load, as if he wanted to represent, slightly modified, the German legend of Leonora?</t2263>
<t2264>All this meant that, in the castle, the stone faces had increased by one that night.</t2264>
<t2265>The Gorgon who presided over the erection of the castle undoubtedly decided to visit his work during the night, noticed that a stone face was missing, the same one they had probably been waiting for for two hundred years, and added it.</t2265>
<t2266>The stone face lay face up on the soft pillow of the Marquis's bed.</t2266> <t2267>It seemed like a very fine mask, with an expression that was a little scared or angry.</t2267> <t2268>Attached to the head was a man's trunk, also petrified, and embedded in the heart of that trunk was a knife.</t2268> <t2269>Around the knife's handle was a paper, on which someone had scribbled the following words:</t2269>
<t2270>“Take him quickly to the grave.</t2270> <t2271>On behalf of Santiago.”</t2271>
<t2272>X.</t2272>
<t2273>TWO PROMISES</t2273>
<t2274>Twelve months passed.</t2274> <t2275>Carlos Darnay had established himself in England as a teacher of the French language and French literature.</t2275> <t2276>Today he would be given the pompous title of professor; at that time he was called a tutor.</t2276> <t2277>He taught young people who had time and wished to learn a living language that was spoken all over the world.</t2277> <t2278>Teachers like Darnay were not easily found in those times.</t2278> <t2279>Princes and kings were far from being able to be among those who could teach, and the ruined nobility did not think of straining their eyes working over the Ledgers of Tellson's Bank, nor of dedicating their skills to the culinary arts or carpentry.</t2279> <t2280>The young Darnay soon became known, as he possessed the secret of making his students find his lessons enjoyable as a teacher, and as a translator, he knew how to put something more into his work than just the knowledge derived from grammar and the dictionary.</t2280> <t2281>Since, moreover, he managed to assimilate the customs of the country in which he lived, it is not surprising that with some perseverance, he managed to prosper.</t2281>
<t2282>When he moved to London, he did not do so driven by the hope of walking on sidewalks of gold or sleeping on a bed of roses.</t2282> <t2283>If he had harbored those hopes, he surely would not have prospered.</t2283> <t2284>He expected work, found it, dedicated himself to it with fervor, and made the most of his labor: that was the secret of his prosperity.</t2284>
<t2285>He spent part of his time in Cambridge, talking with the students and teaching them, almost surreptitiously, European languages, while disregarding Greek and Latin, which were already extensively taught at that educational institution, and the rest of the day he stayed in London.</t2285>
<t2286>But let's move on to a less unpleasant matter.</t2286> <t2287>From the remote times when humanity enjoyed a perpetual summer, to those we suffer today, in which we have to settle for a no less perpetual winter, the world has invariably followed the same course; the course of Charles Darnay... the course of love for woman.</t2287>
<t2288>He had fallen in love with Lucie Manette on the day when danger loomed over his head.</t2288> <t2289>In his ears, no voice had ever resonated with such harmonious, delicate, tender tones as those she used on that occasion in her compassionate voice, nor had his eyes ever seen a face as enchanting, as angelic as Lucie's, when she saw him at the very edge of the grave that false accusers had opened at his feet.</t2289> <t2290>His lips, however, had not revealed the secret of his heart.</t2290> <t2291>The murder committed on the other side of the Channel, in a deserted castle, that robust stone castle, dated back a year, and young Darnay had revealed the state of his soul to no one.</t2291>
<t2292>That Darnay had his reasons for acting in such a manner, he knew perfectly well; but whether those reasons had disappeared, or whether he could no longer keep the secret locked in his chest, the fact is that one summer day, upon his return from Cambridge, he made his way to the quiet corner of Soho, determined to open his heart to Doctor Manette.</t2292> <t2293>The day was drawing to a close, and he knew that Lucie would have gone out with Miss Pross.</t2293>
<t2294>He found the doctor reading by the window.</t2294> <t2295>The energies that once sustained him, preventing him from being overwhelmed by the weight of his tortures, had gradually restored him.</t2295> <t2296>He was now a man strong in his purposes, energetic in his resolutions, vigorous in his actions.</t2296> <t2297>He studied a lot, slept little, endured great fatigue without effort, and was constantly seen content and happy.</t2297> <t2298>Upon seeing Charles Darnay enter his study, he put down the book and extended his right hand to the newcomer.</t2298>
<t2299>—Friend Darnay!—he exclaimed.</t2299><t2300>—How much pleasure your visit gives me!</t2300> <t2301>For the past three or four days, we have been expecting your return.</t2301> <t2302>Yesterday, Mr. Stryver and Mr. Carton were here, and both agreed in saying that you have deprived us of your presence more than necessary.</t2302>
<t2303>—I sincerely appreciate the interest those gentlemen show me—replied Darnay with some coldness.</t2303><t2304>—And Miss Lucía?</t2304>
<t2305>—Alright, thank you very much.</t2305> <t2306>Your return will be a source of joy for all of us...</t2306> <t2307>She has gone shopping, but she won't take long to return.</t2307>
<t2308>—I knew that he was out of the house, doctor.</t2308> <t2309>Precisely, I took advantage of the occasion of his departure to request a conference with you.</t2309>
<t2310>The doctor fell silent.</t2310>
<t2311>—Yes?—he finally asked.</t2311><t2312>—Pull up a chair and we'll talk.</t2312>
<t2313>The young man brought a chair without difficulty, but it seems he found it to start the conference.</t2313>
<t2314>—I have had the pleasure of frequenting this house so often—he began to say at last—for a year and a half, that I hope the subject I am going to touch upon will not be...</t2314>
<t2315>The doctor interrupted him by extending a hand.</t2315>
<t2316>—Is Lucía the topic in question?—he asked.</t2316>
<t2317>—It's Lucía.</t2317>
<t2318>—It always affects me deeply to talk about Lucía; but it is painful for me to hear you speak of her in the tone that you do, Darnay.</t2318>
<t2319>—It is the tone of fervent admiration, of enthusiastic homage, of the deepest love, doctor—replied Darnay.</t2319>
<t2320>Another pause longer than the previous one.</t2320>
<t2321>—I believe it.</t2321> <t2322>It is my pleasure to do you justice... I believe it.</t2322>
<t2323>The doctor's displeasure was so visible that Darnay, realizing he had touched on a subject that upset the father, hesitated.</t2323>
<t2324>—May I continue, sir?—he asked.</t2324>
<t2325>New pause.</t2325>
<t2326>—Yes; please continue.</t2326>
<t2327>—Guess what I am going to say, although it is impossible for you to guess with how much fervor I say it and with how much fervor I feel it, for that it would be necessary for your gaze to penetrate to the most intimate depths of my soul, to see there the hopes and fears, the yearnings and anxieties that overwhelm it under their weight.</t2327> <t2328>My dear Doctor Manette, I love your daughter with a deep, immense, selfless, fervent love; I love her as very few have loved in the world.</t2328> <t2329>You have loved too, doctor: let the love that once quickened the beats of your heart speak for me!</t2329>
<t2330>The doctor, who was listening to the young man with his head slightly turned and his eyes fixed on the ground, suddenly extended an arm upon hearing the last words, and exclaimed:</t2330>
<t2331>—No...! Don't talk about that!...</t2331> <t2332>Don't remind me of it, for heaven's sake!</t2332>
<t2333>Darnay remained silent.</t2333>
<t2334>—Forgive me—replied the doctor after a few seconds.</t2334><t2335>—I do not doubt that you love Lucía...</t2335>
<t2336>Without looking at Darnay, without raising his eyes from the ground, with a sad countenance, he asked:</t2336>
<t2337>—Have you spoken of your love to Lucía?</t2337>
<t2338>—Never.</t2338>
<t2339>—Has he/she written to you?</t2339>
<t2340>—Never.</t2340>
<t2341>—I would be quite ungrateful if I failed to acknowledge that your selflessness has been greatly influenced by your consideration for the father.</t2341> <t2342>The father thanks you.</t2342>
<t2343>He offered his right hand to his interlocutor, but his eyes did not follow the movement of his hand.</t2343>
<t2344>—I know—said Darnay with great respect—I know... how could I not know, having seen you most days? I know that between you and Lucie there exists a love so tender, so exceptional, so moving, so in harmony with the circumstances that have presided over its birth and development, that even in the tenderness that binds parents to their weak children, it would be difficult to find precedents.</t2344> <t2345>I know, Doctor Manette, that along with the love of a daughter, who is now a woman, all the love of her childhood lives in her heart.</t2345> <t2346>I know that, precisely because she was deprived of her father's caresses during her childhood, she has now devoted herself to you with all the constancy, with all the fervor that her years and character give her.</t2346> <t2347>I know perfectly well that if you had descended from heaven after your death to accompany your daughter on earth, you could not be more loved, more sacred, or more revered than you are today.</t2347> <t2348>I know that when your daughter embraces you, it is the arms of the child, the arms of the maiden, the arms of the woman that tenderly encircle your neck.</t2348> <t2349>I know that Lucie, loving you as she does today, loves a mother as young as she is and a father as young as I am; she sees and adores a sorrowful mother, submerged in unfathomable seas of bitterness, and she sees and adores a father buried alive.</t2349> <t2350>I know all this, I have been seeing it night and day, for to know it, it has been enough for me to see you in the sacredness of the home.</t2350>
<t2351>The father continued without changing his attitude, with his head bowed and his eyes downcast.</t2351> <t2352>His breathing became a little uneven, but he did not show any other signs of agitation.</t2352>
<t2353>—And knowing it, Doctor Manette, convinced that to interpose between you a love... my love, is equivalent to introducing into your heaven something that is less sublime than it, I have tried to impose silence on my heart, I have resisted to the utmost limit.</t2353> <t2354>I can't anymore!...</t2354> <t2355>I love her!...</t2355> <t2356>Heaven is my witness that I love her!</t2356>
<t2357>—I believe it—replied the father with a sorrowful tone.</t2357><t2358>—I had been suspecting it for a long time... I believe it.</t2358>
<t2359>—But I would feel—replied Darnay, who thought he detected a reproach in the doctor's sorrowful tone—I would feel that you also believed that, if my fortune were so immense that one day I could call her my wife, I would try to separate you or utter a single word different from those that are coming out of my mouth at this moment.</t2359> <t2360>I fully understand that it would be useless; but in any case, I am not capable of committing such a vile act.</t2360> <t2361>If such low thoughts even brushed my mind, I would not be worthy of touching this honorable hand—he added, extending his own to his interlocutor.</t2361><t2362>—No, my dear Doctor Manette; like you, I am kept away from France by a self-imposed exile; like you, I have fled from it to avoid seeing its mistakes, its oppressions, its miseries; like you, I have resolved to expatriate myself, live by the work of my hands, and place my hopes in a more prosperous future.</t2362> <t2363>My only aspiration is to share your fate, share your life and your home, and be faithful to you until death.</t2363> <t2364>I do not aspire to participate in the precious privilege of Lucie as your daughter and loving companion in life; rather, I seek to strengthen that privilege, to bind her more closely to you, assuming that is possible.</t2364>
<t2365>The young man's hand remained on his father's, who had his on the arms of the chair he was sitting in.</t2365> <t2366>For the first time since the beginning of the conference, the doctor raised his eyes from the floor.</t2366> <t2367>His face reflected the struggle that was taking place within him.</t2367>
<t2368>—You speak with such tenderness, and at the same time with such firmness, Carlos Darnay, that I thank you with all my heart, and I am going to reveal to you... almost reveal my own.</t2368> <t2369>Do you have reasons to believe that Lucía returns your love?</t2369>
<t2370>—None.</t2370>
<t2371>—The immediate purpose of this confidence, is it to ascertain this point right away and with my authorization?</t2371>
<t2372>—Not even that.</t2372> <t2373>I don't expect to obtain that happiness for many weeks, although, naturally, I would like to be free of doubt by tomorrow.</t2373>
<t2374>—Are you seeking my advice and guidance?</t2374>
<t2375>—Nor have I come with the intention of soliciting your advice and help; but I do believe that, if it is within your power to assist me, and you consider it just, you will provide me with some aid.</t2375>
<t2376>—So, what you are looking for is a promise from me.</t2376>
<t2377>—Indeed; that's what I'm looking for.</t2377>
<t2378>—What promise is it?</t2378>
<t2379>—I am quite convinced that, without you, I can expect nothing: I am quite convinced that, even if Lucía loved me as I love her... and do not think that my presumption goes so far as to suppose such a thing, it would be of no use to me if my love were incompatible with the love she owes to her father.</t2379>
<t2380>—If that is the case, you will be well convinced of...</t2380>
<t2381>—I am also convinced that a single word spoken by her father in favor of any suitor for her hand would weigh decisively on her mind, and precisely because I am convinced of this, Dr. Manette, I shall not request that word, even if my life depended on it—concluded the young man, with modesty, but with manly determination.</t2381>
<t2382>—Of that I am sure, Charles Darnay.</t2382> <t2383>Mysteries often arise from deep loves and wide divisions: in the first case, the mysteries are subtle, delicate, and difficult to penetrate.</t2383> <t2384>In this respect, Lucie is a mystery to me: I cannot even approximately guess the state of her heart.</t2384>
<t2385>—Will you allow me to ask, doctor, if she...?</t2385>
<t2386>—Does she have any other suitors?</t2386>
<t2387>—That was what I meant to say.</t2387>
<t2388>The father replied after a few moments of reflection:</t2388>
<t2389>—You have seen yourself that Mr. Carton and Mr. Stryver come to this house with some frequency; if anyone aspires to my daughter's hand, it will be one of the two.</t2389>
<t2390>—Or both—observed Darnay.</t2390>
<t2391>—It hasn't occurred to me that it could be both; moreover, I don't even think it's likely to be either of them.</t2391> <t2392>But you have told me that you desire a promise from me: tell me what it is about.</t2392>
<t2393>"The promise I wish to obtain is that, if someday your daughter were to confide in you as I have just done, you would repeat my words to her, adding that you believe in their sincerity."</t2393> <t2394>"I believe I deserve a sufficiently good opinion from you to not take a stance against me."</t2394> <t2395>"For my part, I will strictly fulfill the condition upon which I base my plea, because you have an indisputable right to its fulfillment."</t2395>
<t2396>—I make the promise you desire, without any condition—replied the doctor.</t2396><t2397>—I firmly believe that your purpose is as you have stated; I believe that you intend to perpetuate, and in no case weaken, the bonds that unite me to the one who is dearer to me than myself.</t2397> <t2398>If one day my daughter tells me that you are necessary for her happiness, I will hasten to give her to you.</t2398> <t2399>If they existed, Charles Darnay, if they existed...</t2399>
<t2400>The young man gratefully shook the doctor's hand.</t2400>
<t2401>—...</t2401> <t2402>Whims, true motives, apprehensions, any other thing, old or recent, against the man whom my daughter truly loved... as long as the responsibility was not personally his... I would forget everything for the love of her.</t2402> <t2403>She is everything to me.</t2403> <t2404>In the face of her happiness, all the grievances I have received, all the torments that...</t2404> <t2405>I am saying what is irrelevant!</t2405>
<t2406>The tone the doctor gave to his words was so peculiar, the abrupt interruption so peculiar, the look he directed at his interlocutor so peculiar, that the latter felt the cold penetrate to the depths of his heart.</t2406>
<t2407>—Without realizing it, I have diverted the conversation—added the doctor, smiling.</t2407><t2408>—What was it that you were telling me?</t2408>
<t2409>Darnay did not know what to answer at first, until he remembered that he had spoken of a condition.</t2409> <t2410>Calmer then, he said:</t2410>
<t2411>—To your trust, I have the unavoidable duty to respond with mine.</t2411> <t2412>My current surname, although it barely differs from my mother's, is not mine, as you know.</t2412> <t2413>I wish to tell you what my real surname is, and explain the reasons for my being in England.</t2413>
<t2414>—No! Be quiet!</t2414>
<t2415>The doctor brought both hands to his ears and then to Darnay's lips.</t2415>
<t2416>—I wish so, because I would like to earn your trust and have no secrets from you.</t2416>
<t2417>—No!</t2417> <t2418>You will tell me when I ask you, but in no way now!</t2418> <t2419>If your aspirations are on the way to being realized, if Lucía reciprocates your love, you will make those revelations to me on the very morning of your wedding.</t2419> <t2420>Do you promise me?</t2420>
<t2421>—With great pleasure.</t2421>
<t2422>—Give me your hand.</t2422> <t2423>My daughter will arrive any moment now, and I wouldn't want her to find us together tonight.</t2423> <t2424>Go away... and may God bless you!</t2424>
<t2425>The night had closed in when Charles Darnay left, and it took Lucia another hour to arrive.</t2425> <t2426>She hurried to the room where her father usually stayed, and was quite surprised to find the chair he invariably occupied while reading vacant.</t2426>
<t2427>—Father!—he called.</t2427><t2428>—My dear father!</t2428>
<t2429>No one answered; but as repeated hammering sounds reached her ears from her father's bedroom, she ran towards it.</t2429> <t2430>She looked through the door and stepped back frightened, crying.</t2430>
<t2431>—What will I do, my God, what will I do?—he exclaimed.</t2431>
<t2432>Only a moment did her uncertainties last.</t2432> <t2433>She knocked on the door with her knuckles and whispered her father's name.</t2433> <t2434>The hammering stopped immediately, her father came out, looked at her silently, and began to pace around the room.</t2434> <t2435>Lucía walked by his side.</t2435>
<t2436>The next morning, Lucía entered the doctor's bedroom very early.</t2436> <t2437>She found him sleeping deeply.</t2437> <t2438>She did not observe any alteration in the shoemaker's bench, nor in the tools, nor in the unfinished shoe.</t2438>
<t2439>XI.</t2439>
<t2440>AMONG COLLEAGUES</t2440>
<t2441>—Prepare another punch, Sydney—said the lawyer Stryver that same night, already in the early hours, to his companion the jackal.</t2441><t2442>—I have to make a confession to you.</t2442>
<t2443>For several nights before, Sydney had been working diligently to reduce and finish the pile of papers waiting their turn on the desk before going on vacation.</t2443> <t2444>Everything was up to date; there was nothing left to do but wait for the arrival of November, abundant in atmospheric fogs and legal fogs.</t2444>
<t2445>Sydney was not a paragon of sobriety and temperance: that night he had to increase by two the number of cold water-soaked towels he usually applied to his head, just as he also doubled the amount of wine consumed prior to applying the towels.</t2445>
<t2446>—Are you preparing the other punch?—asked Stryver, from the sofa on which he was lying on his back.</t2446>
<t2447>—Yes.</t2447>
<t2448>—Listen, then.</t2448> <t2449>I'm going to reveal something to you that will surely amaze you, and who knows, it might even make you think I'm much less clever than I appear.</t2449> <t2450>I've been thinking about getting married.</t2450>
<t2451>—You?</t2451>
<t2452>—Yes.</t2452> <t2453>It will surprise you even more to know that I am not getting married for money.</t2453> <t2454>What do you say?</t2454>
<t2455>—I don't feel like saying much.</t2455> <t2456>Who is she?</t2456>
<t2457>—Guess it.</t2457>
<t2458>—Do I know her?</t2458>
<t2459>—Guess it.</t2459>
<t2460>—It doesn't seem like a good time to start guessing, at five in the morning with my head turned into an erupting volcano.</t2460> <t2461>If you want me to guess, invite me to eat.</t2461>
<t2462>—Since you don't want to guess, I'll tell you myself—said Stryver, sitting lazily.</t2462><t2463>—Of course, I don't harbor the slightest hope of making myself understood by you, simply because you are and always have been an insensitive dog.</t2463>
<t2464>—On the other hand, you have always been and still are a spirit full of sensitivity and poetry—replied Sydney with an ironic tone.</t2464>
<t2465>—Man!...—exclaimed Stryver, laughing.</t2465><t2466>—I don't aspire to be a sentimental novel hero, but you can't deny that I'm softer than you.</t2466>
<t2467>—You mean luckier.</t2467>
<t2468>—No; I meant to say more... more...</t2468>
<t2469>—Gallant: Did I get it right this time?</t2469>
<t2470>—Well! Let's say gallant!</t2470> <t2471>My intention was to say that I am a man who takes care to make myself more pleasant, that I take more interest in making myself more pleasant, that I know the way to make myself more pleasant to women than you do.</t2471>
<t2472>—Go ahead—said Sydney Carton.</t2472>
<t2473>—Calm down, my friend—replied Stryver, shaking his head.</t2473><t2474>—Before going any further, I want to state the following: You have visited Doctor Manette's house as often, if not more often than I have, and frankly, I have been embarrassed by your harsh demeanor, the scowl you always wear there.</t2474> <t2475>Your manners have been those of a bad-tempered dog and your demeanor so gloomy that I have felt ashamed of you, Sydney.</t2475>
<t2476>—You should be highly grateful to me, Stryver, because men of your profession are not usually ashamed of anything—replied Carton.</t2476>
<t2477>—Don't dodge the issue, Sydney.</t2477> <t2478>I consider it my duty to tell you, and I tell it to your face, because I believe I'm doing you a favor, that you lack the qualities to be in society.</t2478> <t2479>You are a decidedly unpleasant companion.</t2479>
<t2480>Sydney took a sip of punch and burst out laughing.</t2480>
<t2481>—Look at me!—replied Stryver, standing up and striking an arrogant pose.</t2481><t2482>—I have less need than you to make myself agreeable, since my position is a thousand times more independent than yours.</t2482><t2483>Why, then, do I always manage to make myself agreeable?</t2483>
<t2484>—In my life, I have never seen you do it.</t2484>
<t2485>—I make myself agreeable because it is required by refined manners and because it is in my blood.</t2485> <t2486>I continue.</t2486>
<t2487>—What you are not continuing, as I see, is the exposition of your matrimonial projects.</t2487> <t2488>As for the rest, do me the favor of not continuing.</t2488> <t2489>Will you never be convinced that I am incorrigible?</t2489>
<t2490>Carton asked this question with a sarcastic tone.</t2490>
<t2491>"To be incorrigible, you would need to have business, and I don't know that you have any," replied Stryver, a little annoyed.</t2491>
<t2492>—As far as I know, I don't have them...</t2492> <t2493>Who is the lucky one?</t2493>
<t2494>—I would not want the mention of the name to cause you sorrow or displeasure—said Stryver, preparing with friendly circumlocutions the revelation he was about to make.</t2494><t2495>—I know that you do not feel half of what you say, although, to tell the truth, if you felt it all, it would be the same, for it would not matter.</t2495> <t2496>I make this preamble because on one occasion you spoke quite lightly of the young lady whose name I am going to pronounce.</t2496>
<t2497>—Me?</t2497>
<t2498>—You, yes; and in this very room.</t2498>
<t2499>Carton treated himself to another glass of punch and looked at his friend.</t2499>
<t2500>—Referring to the young lady I allude to, you said she was a doll with golden hair.</t2500> <t2501>The young lady I refer to is Miss Lucie Manette.</t2501> <t2502>If you knew sensitivity, if you were a man of delicate feelings, it would have bothered me that you spoke of her as you did; but since you are neither sensitive nor delicate, I paid no attention to your frivolity.</t2502> <t2503>You lack both qualities, and therefore, when your expression comes to my mind, I give it the same importance as I would to the opinion of a blind man who claimed a painting of mine was bad, or to that of a deaf-mute who pretended to find faults in a musical composition of mine.</t2503>
<t2504>Carton continued frequently visiting the punch bowl.</t2504>
<t2505>—You know it all already, Sydney—continued Stryver.</t2505><t2506>—I am marrying that girl, regardless of whether she has a fortune or not.</t2506> <t2507>She is a charming creature, and I have resolved to make her happy, and without boasting or immodesty, I believe I can say that I have achieved it.</t2507> <t2508>I hold an enviable position, I am prospering and rising quickly, and I am not lacking in distinction.</t2508> <t2509>In a word: I am a treasure for her, and I am glad, for she deserves treasures.</t2509> <t2510>Are you astonished by what you hear?</t2510>
<t2511>—Why should it amaze me?—responded Sydney, between sips of punch.</t2511>
<t2512>—Do you approve of it?</t2512>
<t2513>—Why shouldn't I approve it?</t2513>
<t2514>—Well!</t2514> <t2515>I see that you are taking it more calmly than I expected, and that, for my sake, you are less mercenary than I thought.</t2515> <t2516>It doesn't surprise me, after all, because you know perfectly well that your old schoolmate has always been distinguished by his strength of character.</t2516> <t2517>Yes, Sydney, yes; I am tired of the life I lead and the time has come to change it.</t2517> <t2518>I have become convinced that it is a delight for a man to have a home, to create a family, if he feels inclined to do so, and I am sure that Miss Manette will always beautify and honor it.</t2518> <t2519>I am, therefore, resolved, firmly decided.</t2519> <t2520>And now, Sydney, my dear friend, allow me to say a few words about your situation.</t2520> <t2521>You are walking down false paths, on the wrong track; you know that as well as I do.</t2521> <t2522>You don't understand the value of money, you live a disordered life, you don't think about tomorrow, and in short, your behavior can only lead you to illness and misery.</t2522> <t2523>I think you need to find yourself a nurse.</t2523>
<t2524>The protective tone with which Stryver spoke accentuated the impertinence of his words and made them doubly offensive.</t2524>
<t2525>—Do not be offended that I now recommend you study the matter head-on and without stupid prejudices as I have studied it, although our respective conditions differ greatly.</t2525> <t2526>Get married.</t2526> <t2527>Find someone to take care of you.</t2527> <t2528>It doesn't matter if the company of women is not to your liking; it doesn't matter if you lack intelligence or tact to deal with them.</t2528> <t2529>Find a respectable woman who has some assets, and marry her as soon as possible, the only way to prepare yourself in time against the calamities and uncertainties of life.</t2529> <t2530>I have finished.</t2530> <t2531>Think about it, Sydney.</t2531>
<t2532>—I'll think about it—replied Sydney Carton.</t2532>
<t2533>Chapter XII.</t2533>
<t2534>THE DELICATE KNIGHT</t2534>
<t2535>Once Mr. Stryver resolved to secure Miss Manette's happiness, nothing was more natural than to let her know as soon as possible the joy that his magnanimity had bestowed upon her.</t2535> <t2536>After mentally debating and with due deliberation on such an important matter, he concluded that he should take the preliminary steps right away, before going on vacation, leaving the setting of the wedding date for later, which could take place one or two weeks before Michaelmas, or during the brief Christmas holidays.</t2536>
<t2537>That he had already won the lawsuit in advance was so evident that it would have been foolish to doubt it.</t2537> <t2538>It was a clear case, without any weak points, one of those lawsuits where it is enough to file the complaint to obtain a favorable judgment.</t2538> <t2539>He could even spare himself the trouble of reasoning his request.</t2539> <t2540>Why?</t2540> <t2541>The jury would rule in his favor without even deliberating: the famous lawyer was more than convinced of this.</t2541>
<t2542>Consequently, Stryver began his vacation by proposing to Miss Manette to take her to the Vauxhall Gardens.</t2542> <t2543>After the offer was declined, he invited her to Ranelagh; and since, to his great surprise, this invitation was also not accepted, he resolved to declare the noble aspirations of his soul in the same little house in Soho.</t2543>
<t2544>One morning, Stryver left the Temple Court and directed his steps towards the peaceful retreat where Dr. Manette lived.</t2544> <t2545>Since Tellson's Bank was on his way, and knowing the close friendship between Mr. Lorry and the Manettes, it occurred to him to enter the Bank and reveal to him the radiant star that was casting bright rays on the horizon of Soho.</t2545> <t2546>He opened the door, which creaked harshly as it turned on its worn hinges, descended the two steps, and soon presented himself in the office where Lorry, bent over his books, was writing endless columns of perfectly aligned numbers.</t2546>
<t2547>—Hello, Mr. Lorry!—exclaimed Stryver upon entering.</t2547><t2548>—How are you?</t2548> <t2549>I suppose as well as always.</t2549>
<t2550>—Hello, Mr. Stryver!—responded Lorry, shaking the hand that the lawyer extended to him.</t2550><t2551>—Very well, thank you; and you?</t2551> <t2552>Do you need something from me, Mr. Stryver?</t2552>
<t2553>—No... thank you very much.</t2553> <t2554>I have the desire to pay you a private visit, Mr. Lorry; the desire to say a few words to you in private.</t2554>
<t2555>—Oh, whichever ones you want!—replied Lorry, closing the book and getting ready to listen.</t2555>
<t2556>—I'm going...—the lawyer began to say, resting his elbows on the table and in a confidential tone,—I'm going to make a marriage proposal to your dear and pleasant little friend Lucía Manette, Mr. Lorry.</t2556>
<t2557>—Damn!—exclaimed Lorry, scratching his beard and looking perplexed at the lawyer.</t2557>
<t2558>—Demon?—repeated Stryver vividly.</t2558><t2559>—Is that what you come up with to say to me?</t2559> <t2560>What does your exclamation mean, Mr. Lorry?</t2560>
<t2561>—It is an exclamation... friendly... personal... purely appreciative, that can mean whatever you wish it to mean.</t2561> <t2562>The truth is, Mr. Stryver... it seems to me... I find...</t2562>
<t2563>—Enough!—replied the lawyer, slamming his hand on the table.</t2563><t2564>—If I understand what you're saying, Mr. Lorry, hang me!</t2564>
<t2565>Lorry adjusted his toupee on his head and stood looking at his interlocutor, biting the bristles of his pen.</t2565>
<t2566>—Do you consider me ineligible?—asked Stryver, staring intently at his interlocutor.</t2566>
<t2567>—Quite the contrary, Mr. Stryver! Yes... you are eligible.</t2567>
<t2568>—Am I not a good match?</t2568>
<t2569>—Good match; yes... why not?</t2569>
<t2570>—No progress? No improvement?</t2570>
<t2571>—Yes, sir... who doubts it?</t2571>
<t2572>—Then, what the hell does his attitude mean?</t2572>
<t2573>—Well... I... Tell me: where were you going now?</t2573>
<t2574>—Straight to the point—replied Stryver, punching the table.</t2574>
<t2575>—If I were in your place, I would leave it for a better occasion.</t2575>
<t2576>—Why?—thundered the lawyer.</t2576><t2577>—I am going to press you to the utmost limit.</t2577> <t2578>As a businessman, you are obliged to speak with justified reason.</t2578> <t2579>Give the reasons: why wouldn't you go?</t2579>
<t2580>—Because it is a matter that I would never address without having well-founded hopes of achieving the realization of my desire.</t2580>
<t2581>—Wrath of God!—shouted Stryver.</t2581><t2582>—It's a reason that knocks you flat on your back!</t2582>
<t2583>Lorry did not respond.</t2583>
<t2584>—Here is a businessman, a man of years, a man of experience... in a Bank, who after admitting the existence of the three main reasons, each of which is sufficient on its own to ensure success, comes out saying that there is no reason at all.</t2584> <t2585>If that isn't the most absurd of absurdities, then let God come and see it!</t2585>
<t2586>—When I referred to success, I was thinking of Miss Manette, and when speaking of causes and reasons on which to base the hopes of seeing the desire fulfilled, I was referring to causes that were truly so for Miss Manette.</t2586> <t2587>Yes... my good friend... the young lady, because the young lady is the sole and unappealable judge.</t2587>
<t2588>—So, what you want to tell me, Mr. Lorry, is that the young lady, in your opinion, is a finicky fool.</t2588>
<t2589>—You interpret me in a hurtful way, Mr. Stryver—replied Lorry, red with anger.</t2589><t2590>—What I meant to say, and what I am saying, is that I will not tolerate any tongue uttering a disrespectful word about Miss Manette, and that if I knew of any man... which I want to believe does not exist, any man of such coarse taste and impetuous temperament, who dared to speak with little respect of Miss Manette, the consideration of being at Tellson's Bank would not be enough for me to leave his rudeness unpunished.</t2590>
<t2591>The need to contain within his chest the anger that struggled to explode had put Stryver in a dangerous state of mind; as for Lorry, despite having accustomed his blood to not be disturbed by anything or anyone, he found himself in a state of mind as dangerous as that of the lawyer.</t2591>
<t2592>—You know what I wanted to tell you, sir—replied Lorry.</t2592><t2593>—I would greatly appreciate it if you don't forget it.</t2593>
<t2594>There followed a moment of silence, during which Stryver sucked on the end of a small iron square he had taken from the table.</t2594> <t2595>Finally, he broke the truly painful silence by saying:</t2595>
<t2596>—What you are telling me, Mr. Lorry, is so new, so inconceivable, that I cannot quite understand it, despite the clarity of your words.</t2596> <t2597>Are you truly advising me not to go to Soho and offer my hand... the hand of the famous lawyer Stryver, to the daughter of Doctor Manette?</t2597>
<t2598>—Are you asking me for honesty, Mr. Stryver?</t2598>
<t2599>—Yes.</t2599>
<t2600>—Perfectly.</t2600> <t2601>You have repeated word for word and letter for letter what I must reply.</t2601> <t2602>Do not present yourself in Soho, nor offer your hand... the hand of the brilliant lawyer Stryver, to the daughter of Doctor Manette.</t2602>
<t2603>—And I reply that this... ha, ha, ha, ha! beats all the past, present, and future nonsense hands down.</t2603>
<t2604>—Let's dot the i's and cross the t's—added Lorry;—as a businessman, I can say nothing about the matter we are debating, because as a businessman, I know nothing: but as an old friend of the house, as a man who has rocked Miss Manette in his arms, who is the trusted friend of Miss Manette and her father, as a man who loves them both dearly, I can speak, and as such, I have spoken.</t2604> <t2605>Now then: do you think I could be wrong?</t2605>
<t2606>—Not even in your dreams!</t2606> <t2607>Common sense is a rare plant that grows in few places.</t2607> <t2608>I have never hoped to find it outside of myself.</t2608> <t2609>I supposed that perhaps it existed where, apparently, according to you, only folly finds fertile ground.</t2609> <t2610>I am disappointed, I confess, as I expected something else; but I believe you are right.</t2610>
<t2611>—I have neither spoken of fertilized or unfertilized grounds for folly to grow in, nor will I tolerate... inside or outside Tellson's Bank, anyone born offending people whose name can only be pronounced on one's knees!—shouted Lorry, growing furious again.</t2611>
<t2612>—Don't trouble yourself: I beg you to forgive phrases said without the intention of bothering anyone.</t2612>
<t2613>—Forgiven, and thank you.</t2613> <t2614>What I meant to say was the following: it would be painful for you to suffer a disappointment, it would be painful for Dr. Manette to find himself in the position of having to be explicit with you, and it would be very painful for Miss Lucía to find herself in the harsh necessity of speaking frankly to you.</t2614> <t2615>You know that I have the honor and the happiness of being a good friend of the family.</t2615> <t2616>Well then: if you want me, without representing you in any way, without involving you in anything at all, to make new observations that confirm or modify the impressions I have today, I offer myself for that right away.</t2616> <t2617>If the result of my new observations does not satisfy you, you will be free to personally verify their foundation; otherwise, we will have at least managed to avoid unpleasant scenes and situations.</t2617> <t2618>What do you think of my plan?</t2618>
<t2619>—How long would it take you to answer me?</t2619>
<t2620>—Oh! It's a matter of a few hours!</t2620> <t2621>This afternoon I can go to Soho, and from there go straight to your house.</t2621>
<t2622>—If that's the case, it seems fine to me.</t2622> <t2623>I will wait for you tonight...</t2623> <t2624>Good morning!</t2624>
<t2625>The gentleman Stryver left the Bank building with a tempest of anger in his chest.</t2625> <t2626>He had enough insight to understand that the banker would not have expressed his opinions on the matter so clearly if he had not had such a solid foundation to support them, which amounted to a moral certainty.</t2626> <t2627>He was far from thinking, when he entered the Bank, that such a bitter pill awaited him; but he had no choice but to swallow it.</t2627>
<t2628>—You have put yourself in an awkward situation, Stryver—he said to himself;—you have made a fool of yourself...</t2628> <t2629>Now's the time for your forensic talent to get out of this mess!</t2629>
<t2630>It was clearly visible that the pill had gotten stuck in his throat and that the eminent lawyer was looking for a way to spit it out.</t2630>
<t2631>—Ah, my dear miss!—he murmured after a few moments.</t2631><t2632>—I will not be the one to bear the ridicule!...</t2632><t2633>You will have the pleasure of keeping the fruit of the cucurbit family that you have reserved for me!</t2633>
<t2634>Indeed: that night, when Lorry arrived at the lawyer's house, he found him among stacks of papers and piles of books purposely placed on his desk, absorbed in his work and completely oblivious to the matter discussed that morning.</t2634> <t2635>He even seemed surprised to see Lorry.</t2635>
<t2636>—I have been in Soho—said the emissary, after more than half an hour spent in vain attempts to broach the subject.</t2636>
<t2637>—In Soho?—repeated Stryver with glacial indifference.</t2637><t2638>—Ah... yes!</t2638> <t2639>What a head I have!</t2639> <t2640>Would you believe that I didn't remember such a thing?</t2640>
<t2641>—I no longer have the slightest doubt that the advice I gave you was extremely accurate.</t2641> <t2642>My impressions have been fully confirmed.</t2642>
<t2643>—Believe me, I truly regret it very much for you—replied Stryver with perfect calm,—and no less truly for the poor father.</t2643> <t2644>It is an incident that the family will always remember with sorrow, and that... But let's not talk about it.</t2644>
<t2645>—I confess that I do not understand.</t2645>
<t2646>—I believe it; but it doesn't matter... it doesn't matter.</t2646>
<t2647>—On the contrary—replied Lorry,—it matters, and I would like it to be explained.</t2647>
<t2648>—I repeat, it doesn't matter.</t2648> <t2649>I thought I saw common sense and laudable ambition where neither exists.</t2649> <t2650>I was mistaken, I am cured of my error, and the matter is concluded.</t2650> <t2651>Fortunately, my error is one that does not cause harm to the one who was its victim.</t2651> <t2652>There are many young ladies who have committed similar follies, which they have come to regret when it was already too late, when they found themselves plunged into ruin and misery...</t2652> <t2653>Poor things!... I do not blame them! Indeed, they are worthy of compassion!</t2653> <t2654>Youth is so thoughtless!...</t2654> <t2655>Seeing what happened from a point of view free of all selfishness, I regret it, because it would have been a good deal for her, and if I look at it through the prism of my selfishness, I cannot help but celebrate a failure that saves me from making a disastrous deal.</t2655> <t2656>You will understand, without me having to say it, that I, far from gaining, was losing, and not a little.</t2656> <t2657>Of course, so far it has done me no harm.</t2657> <t2658>I have not offered my hand to that young lady, and here between us, speaking frankly, I never thought of making such an offer.</t2658> <t2659>Follow my advice, Mr. Lorry: never try to fight against the frivolities and follies of those flighty little heads if you don't want to reap disappointments in abundance... No... do me the favor!</t2659> <t2660>Let's leave this conversation.</t2660> <t2661>I repeat that I regret what happened for others but I am glad for what concerns me.</t2661> <t2662>I will never thank you enough for the advice you gave me.</t2662> <t2663>You know that young lady much better than I do... You were right...</t2663> <t2664>I was about to make a blunder although I surely would not have gone through with it.</t2664>
<t2665>Such was Lorry's bewilderment and astonishment that he could think of nothing else but to stare stupidly at his interlocutor, whose face reflected generosity, nobility, and good intentions.</t2665>
<t2666>—Believe me, my dear friend!—repeated Stryver as he accompanied Lorry to the door,—follow my advice.</t2666> <t2667>Thank you very much... Good night!</t2667>
<t2668>Lorry found himself in the street before he realized what was happening to him.</t2668> <t2669>Stryver lay on his back on the sofa, staring at the ceiling.</t2669>
<t2670>Chapter XIII.</t2670>
<t2671>THE INDELICATE SUBJECT</t2671>
<t2672>If ever, or anywhere, Sydney Carton shone, it certainly was not in the abode of Mr. Manette.</t2672> <t2673>He visited it quite frequently for an entire year, and he was always sad, taciturn, pensive.</t2673> <t2674>And it was not that he lacked oratory skills, no; he knew how to speak perfectly well when he set his mind to it; but the cloud that enveloped him was so dense that the luminous flashes of his intelligence very rarely managed to pierce through it.</t2674>
<t2675>That the streets near the mentioned house, and even the insensible stones of the sidewalks, exerted a mysterious attraction on him, could not be questioned.</t2675> <t2676>More than one night he could have been found wandering like a lost soul in those places, especially when the wine failed to infiltrate his chest with a fictitious and transitory joy.</t2676> <t2677>More than one early morning, the pale glows of the dawning aurora revealed, not far from the doctor's house, the contours of a figure, which if it was not Sydney Carton himself, bore a notable resemblance to him.</t2677> <t2678>More than one morning, the first rays of the sun, while highlighting the architectural beauties of the church bell towers and the most notable buildings, brought discouragement to the chest of the solitary night wanderer, making him see that there are things that man, with all his good will, cannot achieve.</t2678> <t2679>For some time before, the disordered bed that Carton had in the Temple Court rarely deserved the honor of being used by its owner, and it is noteworthy that, even when this happened by exception, Carton would get up after a few minutes to continue his wanderings.</t2679>
<t2680>One day in the month of August, when Mr. Stryver, after informing his friend that "more careful reflections had led him to abandon his matrimonial plans," had transferred to Devonshire the treasures of finesse and delicacy inherent to his person, one of those August days when the wicked find in the chalice of flowers rich springs of goodness, the sick find health, and the old and worn-out find youth, Carton, a slave to his habit, wandered like a lost soul through the streets.</t2680> <t2681>He walked irresolutely and aimlessly; but suddenly his eyes lit up; his feet were animated by the breath of the intention that sprang in his mind, and those feet, faithful and submissive slaves to the latter, carried him straight to the door of Dr. Manette.</t2681>
<t2682>Lucía, whom he found alone and absorbed in her tasks, received him with some unease, and it is even more than likely that if she could have had her way, she would have refused to receive him, for Carton's manner always inspired a certain feeling of mistrust in her.</t2682> <t2683>However, as the first phrases were exchanged between them, she noticed something in the expression on her visitor's face that first reassured her, and then stirred compassion in her heart.</t2683>
<t2684>"Do you feel unwell, Mr. Carton?" she asked.</t2684>
<t2685>—I am not well, it is true: but the life I lead, Miss Manette, is not the best way to enjoy good health.</t2685> <t2686>What can we libertines expect!</t2686>
<t2687>—And isn't it a pity?...</t2687> <t2688>I beg you to forgive me; but since, without realizing it, the beginning of the question slipped from my lips, I will finish it, although making it clear that nothing could be further from my mind than the intention to offend you.</t2688> <t2689>Isn't it a pity that you don't try to live a more orderly life?</t2689>
<t2690>—It's something more than pity!</t2690> <t2691>God knows very well that it's a shame!</t2691>
<t2692>—So, why doesn't he correct himself?</t2692>
<t2693>Lucía, who looked directly at her interlocutor when she asked the question, saw, with a mix of surprise and sorrow, that Carton's eyes were filled with tears.</t2693> <t2694>Tears also flowed in his voice when he replied:</t2694>
<t2695>—It's no longer time...</t2695> <t2696>I will never be better than I am today... on the contrary... I will get worse... I will descend more and more...</t2696>
<t2697>Resting his elbows on the table, he covered his eyes with his hands.</t2697> <t2698>The table trembled during the painful silence that followed.</t2698>
<t2699>—Forgive me, Miss Manette—replied Carton.</t2699><t2700>—I carry a secret that weighs heavily on me and that I wish to reveal to you: would you be so kind as to deign to listen to me?</t2700>
<t2701>"If listening to you will be beneficial for you, Mr. Carton, if it will provide you with a contentment that you apparently do not have now, speak, for in listening to you I will have special pleasure."</t2701>
<t2702>—God will undoubtedly reward you for the compassion with which you treat me.</t2702>
<t2703>Carton calmed down somewhat, removed his hands from his eyes, and replied with a firm tone:</t2703>
<t2704>—Do not be alarmed by my words nor be frightened if I tell you that I have already lived what I was meant to live, that I am like someone who has died very young.</t2704> <t2705>Nothing remains in me capable of bearing fruit... I am barren for good.</t2705>
<t2706>—No, Mr. Carton, no!</t2706> <t2707>You are young, there are still sediments of goodness in your soul.</t2707> <t2708>I am sure that, with a little bit of goodwill, you can become very worthy of yourself...</t2708>
<t2709>—Tell me how I can make myself worthy of your pity, at least, miss, and although I know you are mistaken, although I read in the depths of my shipwrecked heart the deception in which you find yourself, I will never forget it.</t2709>
<t2710>A dense paleness covered the girl's cheeks: her hands trembled.</t2710>
<t2711>—If a miracle of God, assuming that divine omnipotence could reach so far, had made it possible for you, Miss Lucía, to reciprocate the love of the man who at this moment stands before your eyes, the love of this degraded, lost, libertine, drunken being, this repugnant remnant of humanity... which is nothing else but what I am... you know it very well, the happiness that would flood my soul, as great as it would be, would not prevent me from seeing that the union of our destinies would drag you down to the depths of my miseries, would plunge you into the abysses of pain and late repentance, would envelop you in waves of dishonor.</t2711> <t2712>I am firmly convinced of this; as convinced as I am that your heart cannot hold any tenderness for me.</t2712> <t2713>I do not expect it, I do not ask for it!</t2713> <t2714>Moreover: I thank Heaven that has made it impossible!</t2714>
<t2715>—Couldn't I save you, Mr. Carton, without those affections you refer to? Couldn't I?... </t2715> <t2716>Forgive me again!</t2716> <t2717>Couldn't I show you a better path, guide you on straighter paths?</t2717> <t2718>Must it be impossible for me to repay in some way the trust you place in me?</t2718> <t2719>Because I know it is a trust—added Lucie modestly, though with some hesitation—a trust that you would not place in anyone else, and that you place in me.</t2719> <t2720>Couldn't we turn that trust to your benefit, Mr. Carton?</t2720>
<t2721>—No, Miss Lucía—replied Carton, shaking his head with an expression of bitter sadness.</t2721><t2722>—Impossible.</t2722> <t2723>If you would be so kind as to listen to me for a few more moments, you will have done for me all that you can do.</t2723> <t2724>I want you to know that it has been the last dream of my soul: I want you to know that your image and that of your father, the sight of this home, which is such thanks to you, have reached the deep abyss of my degradation and stirred there shadows that I believed dead forever: I want you to know that, since I have known you, I feel the sting of remorse that I thought lifeless and ineffective, and whispers of ancient voices that I believed forever silenced sound in my ears.</t2724> <t2725>I have even come to seriously think about starting, about engaging in new struggles, about inaugurating a new life, about running with new courage to the arena so long abandoned!...</t2725> <t2726>Chimeras... illusions, dreams that can lead to nothing practical!</t2726> <t2727>But chimeras, dreams, and illusions evoked by you, inspired by you!</t2727>
<t2728>—But those illusions, those dreams, they must have left something in your soul...</t2728> <t2729>Oh Mr. Carton! Seek... ponder... try!</t2729>
<t2730>—It's useless: I would be wasting my time, and besides, I don't deserve to live.</t2730> <t2731>And yet, to give you an idea of the inconceivable extremes to which human aberrations can go, I will confess that I have had the weakness, and still have the frankness, to wish that you know the prodigious speed with which I have been transformed, from a heap of extinguished and frozen ashes, into a living fire... although a fire entirely similar to my corrupted nature, a fire that animates nothing, that illuminates nothing, that serves no purpose, a fire that is lost.</t2731>
<t2732>—Since I have had the misfortune of making you more unfortunate than you were before you met me...</t2732>
<t2733>—Don't say that, Miss Lucía; if I were capable of redemption, you would have redeemed me; if my misfortunes could have an end, you would have put an end to them.</t2733> <t2734>It is not you, it could not have been you who caused my misfortune to be greater.</t2734>
<t2735>—I meant to say that, if the current state of his soul is due to my influences, wouldn't there be a way to channel those influences in a way that would be beneficial to him?</t2735> <t2736>Can't I do any good for him?</t2736>
<t2737>—The greatest, the only one I could desire, has already been provided to me.</t2737> <t2738>Will you allow me to keep the memory that you were the last person to whom I opened my heart during the rest of my disordered life, and the belief that there is something in it that has deserved your compassionate pity, and with that, you do me the greatest good I could dream of.</t2738>
<t2739>—With all my soul, I would like to convince you, Mr. Carton, that with a little bit of effort and another bit of goodwill, you would achieve better things.</t2739>
<t2740>—Her excellent heart deceives her, Miss Lucía.</t2740> <t2741>Believe me: I have put myself to the test, and the result has been deplorable: I am incapable of redemption.</t2741> <t2742>I know that I am causing you sorrow, and I will finish.</t2742> <t2743>I have entrusted the sweetest secret of my life to a pure and innocent heart.</t2743> <t2744>When the memory of this day arises in my mind, will I be allowed to harbor the comforting belief that this heart has received it and keeps it, resolved not to confide it to anyone else?</t2744>
<t2745>—If that belief is a comfort to you, hold on to it.</t2745>
<t2746>—Do you promise not to reveal it to anyone, not even to the person dearest to you today or who may be in the future?</t2746>
<t2747>—Mr. Carton—replied Lucie with agitation,—the secret is not mine, but yours: rest assured that I will know how to respect it.</t2747>
<t2748>—Thank you very much... and God bless you!</t2748>
<t2749>Carton took the hand that Lucía extended to him, brought it to his lips, and began to walk towards the door.</t2749>
<t2750>—Count on it, Miss Lucía, that I will never refer to the conversation we just had.</t2750> <t2751>If I were to drop dead this instant, the secret would not be better kept, as far as I am concerned.</t2751> <t2752>A pure heart, an innocent heart is the holy ark where from today my name, my mistakes, my miseries, my final confession are kept... Ah!</t2752> <t2753>At the hour of my death, it will be an ineffable comfort for me to embrace this thought, which will be my sacred companion for the rest of my life!</t2753>
<t2754>Abundant tears ran down the cheeks of Lucía Manette.</t2754>
<t2755>—Don't cry, Miss Lucía, for I don't deserve anyone, much less an angel like you, to shed tears for me.</t2755> <t2756>Within one or two hours, vile friendships and vicious habits, which I despise but to which I succumb, will make me an object less worthy of those tears than the last human wreck dragging its miseries through the streets.</t2756> <t2757>I want, however, to make it clear that, if outwardly I will continue to be what I have been up to now, for you, my inner self will be what it is now.</t2757> <t2758>My penultimate plea is to ask you to believe me.</t2758>
<t2759>—I believe you, Mr. Carton, I believe you.</t2759>
<t2760>—I am going to make my final plea to you, and then I will free you from the presence of a visitor in whose degraded soul your angelic one cannot find a single harmonious chord, and from whom you are separated by a bottomless and boundless abyss.</t2760> <t2761>I know that saying it is useless; but it springs from my soul and I cannot keep it silent.</t2761> <t2762>For you, and for anyone you care about, I will do everything.</t2762> <t2763>To sacrifice a lost existence is no merit, I know; but if Providence were to give me the opportunity to sacrifice it, for you and for the people you care about, I would gladly do so.</t2763> <t2764>Try to retain in your memory what I am saying.</t2764> <t2765>The day will come, and it will not be long, when you will form new bonds, new bonds that will tie you very closely to the man who has the fortune to deserve you, the most tender, the sweetest, the most beautiful bonds that can bring joy to human existence.</t2765> <t2766>Oh, Miss Lucia!</t2766> <t2767>In the midst of the happiness that awaits you, when the happy face of your father is joined by that of another man who looks into your eyes, remember sometimes that in the world there lives a being ready to give his life at any moment in exchange for preserving the life of the mortal you love!</t2767> <t2768>The last favor I ask of you is not to forget my offer...</t2768> <t2769>Goodbye... goodbye!... May God bless you!</t2769>
<t2770>Chapter XIV.</t2770>
<t2771>THE HONORABLE MINSTREL</t2771>
<t2772>Many and very varied objects paraded before the eyes of Jeremías Lapa during the hours he spent daily sitting on his rustic bench on Fleet Street, accompanied by his unattractive offspring.</t2772> <t2773>Anyone who spent the liveliest hours of the day on Fleet Street, sitting on a bench or a chair, on a stone or on the hard ground, would inevitably end the day dazed and deafened, due to the two immense, endless processions that, despite following opposite directions, one from East to West, the other from West to East, inevitably walked towards the same end, towards the world that the red and purple rays of the sun never visit.</t2773>
<t2774>The good Lapa, chewing the obligatory straw, watched the course of the two gigantic streams, similar to that gentle rustic who spent several centuries contemplating the course of a river, with the only difference between the two being that the latter feared the river would dry up, while Jeremiah was certain that the course of those streams would never be interrupted.</t2774> <t2775>It is true that this certainty was for Lapa a source of cheerful hopes, since a large part of his income was earned by serving as a guide for women who wished to cross the street.</t2775> <t2776>Although, as a general rule, the ladies who sought his services were well into the decline of life, and on the other hand, the relationships established during the brief crossing were necessarily short-lived, such an impression did the fiery Jeremiah have of the fair sex that he never rendered such a service without expressing a fervent desire to be granted the honor of drinking to the health of his companion.</t2776>
<t2777>There were times when poets would sit on a bench in the most public places to think, and meditate, and reflect in plain view of people.</t2777> <t2778>Jeremías Lapa also sat on a bench in a public place; but since he was not a poet, he thought, reflected, and meditated as little as possible, and instead, he looked around a lot.</t2778>
<t2779>He was going through one of those distressing moments when street traffic was sparse, and even sparser were the women who wished to cross it, one of those moments when his business looked so disheartening that our hero began to suspect that his wife might be kneeling and praying in some corner, when his attention was caught by an unusual torrent of people, surging down Fleet Street, following the very course of the sun, that is, towards the West.</t2779> <t2780>Upon examining the torrent, Lapa saw that it was a funeral procession which undoubtedly was not to the people's liking, as they were objecting to its passage.</t2780>
<t2781>—It's a burial, son—said Jeremías to his offspring.</t2781>
<t2782>"Long live... father!" shouted Lapa's son, doing four kicks in the air.</t2782>
<t2783>The little gentleman imbued his cry of joy with a mysterious significance that displeased the father to such an extent that he watched closely and soon seized the opportunity to grab his offspring by the ear.</t2783>
<t2784>—What is that?—shouted Jeremiah's father.</t2784><t2785>—What does that cheer mean?</t2785> <t2786>Is that the respect you have for your father?</t2786> <t2787>This boy is a rascal, a scoundrel, as scoundrelly as his cheers!</t2787> <t2788>Don't let me hear you again, if you don't want to feel my wrath!</t2788> <t2789>Do you understand?</t2789>
<t2790>—Was I hurting anyone?—exclaimed the boy in protest, rubbing his ear.</t2790>
<t2791>—What you weren't doing was right!—replied Lapa.</t2791><t2792>—Get up on this bench and look at the crowds.</t2792>
<t2793>The son obeyed.</t2793> <t2794>The crowds came shouting wildly and jumping around a dirty and old death cart, followed by a hearse just as dirty, old, and tarnished as the cart, occupied by a single representative of mourning, who displayed the funeral attire that she considered indispensable to the dignity of her position.</t2794> <t2795>It did not seem, however, that her position was very desirable, as the mobs jumped around the carriage shouting until deafening her, making faces and contortions, mocking her respectable person, and hurling unpleasant apostrophes to her ear.</t2795>
<t2796>Funerals were always a special source of excitement for Jeremías Lapa; it is not surprising, then, that on this occasion, involving a funeral with such a noisy entourage, it drove him to the point of asking the first person he encountered:</t2796>
<t2797>—What's up, brother?</t2797> <t2798>What's that?</t2798>
<t2799>—I don't know—replied the questioned one without stopping.</t2799> <t2800>Spies!...</t2800> <t2801>Spies!</t2801>
<t2802>—Who is the dead person?—he asked another.</t2802>
<t2803>—I don't know—he also replied, placing his hands in front of his mouth like a megaphone, and shouting with redoubled fury:—Spies! Spies!</t2803>
<t2804>Lapa finally stumbled upon a person better informed about the case, thanks to whom he was able to find out that it was the burial of an individual named Rogerio Cly.</t2804>
<t2805>—Was he a spy?—asked Lapa.</t2805>
<t2806>—Spy of the Old Bailey—replied the informant.</t2806><t2807>—Spy... yes... spy of the Old Bailey!</t2807>
<t2808>—Damn!—exclaimed Lapa, recalling the sight he had witnessed in the past.</t2808><t2809>—I know him.</t2809> <t2810>Is he dead?</t2810>
<t2811>—Dead like my grandmother! And he should be even more dead!... Get out!... Spy!...</t2811> <t2812>Throw him in here!</t2812>
<t2813>Such a brilliant idea had to be inevitably accepted by those crowds, and so it was, indeed.</t2813> <t2814>Everyone eagerly seized upon the cry and repeated it a thousand times, as they drew so close to the hearse and the funeral carriage that they forced them to stop.</t2814> <t2815>In the blink of an eye, they seized the representative of the mourning; but he, who was anything but clumsy, so admirably knew how to make use of the time that in another blink of an eye he gave the crowds the slip by dashing down a side alley, not without leaving in their hands his cape, his hat, the veil that covered him to his knees, the obligatory white handkerchief, and other symbolic tears.</t2815>
<t2816>The town entertained itself by tearing and scattering to the four winds the indicated objects and garments, demonstrating wild joy, while the merchants hurriedly closed the doors of their establishments, as the mob, in those happy times, was a highly dangerous monster, capable of devouring everything once it opened its jaws.</t2816> <t2817>They had already opened the doors of the hearse to take out the coffin, when another genius proposed escorting it to its destination amidst general rejoicing.</t2817> <t2818>The proposal, like all those that are eminently practical, deserved to be approved by acclamation, and immediately eight individuals stormed the coach while another six climbed onto the roof of the hearse.</t2818> <t2819>One of the first volunteers was Jeremías Lapa, who, in his modesty, hid himself and his head in a corner of the coach.</t2819>
<t2820>The funeral home employees protested against that alteration of the ceremony; but the distance to the river was alarmingly short, and several voices had already advocated the effectiveness of a cold immersion to bring the recalcitrant funeral employees to their senses, and as a result, the protests were weak and brief.</t2820> <t2821>The procession continued once it was reformed.</t2821> <t2822>A chimney sweep guided the hearse, advised by a professional coachman sitting next to him, and the driving of the car was handled by a baker, assisted in turn by a responsible minister.</t2822> <t2823>A Hungarian with his bear, a very popular street type at that time, joined the procession; the bear, being black and very thin, perfectly harmonized with the funereal character of the procession of which it was a part.</t2823>
<t2824>In this manner, the disordered procession continued, growing at every step and forcing all the shops on the streets it passed through to close.</t2824> <t2825>The end of the journey was the old church of San Pancracio, located outside the city, where it arrived in due time.</t2825> <t2826>The burial of Rogerio Cly's corpse was carried out according to an extravagant ceremony, much to the satisfaction of the large accompanying crowd.</t2826>
<t2827>Once the deceased was buried, the author of the previous humorous proposition, or perhaps another genius, as they are never lacking in crowds, conceived and proposed the diabolical idea, unanimously approved, of accusing passersby of being spies from the Old Bailey and calling for vengeance against all those whom chance brought to those places.</t2827> <t2828>Dozens of innocent unfortunates who had never in their lives been within a thousand yards of the despised court were pursued like wild beasts, harassed, and mercilessly beaten.</t2828> <t2829>The transition from this game to breaking windows, knocking down doors and windows, and looting inns and taverns could not have been simpler, more natural, or more logical.</t2829> <t2830>After several hours of looting, when several country houses had been stormed, many shops ransacked, and numerous iron fences destroyed, providing weapons to the most belligerent characters, word spread that the guards were coming.</t2830> <t2831>The mere news was enough to disperse the mobs before the guards arrived, who perhaps did not even think of approaching the scene of the events.</t2831>
<t2832>Jeremías Lapa did not take part in the recent disturbances; he preferred to remain in the cemetery, conversing with the funeral home employees and engaging in somber reflections.</t2832> <t2833>The realm of death always exerted a calming influence on him.</t2833> <t2834>Sitting on a grave, smoking a pipe he had acquired from the nearby tavern with philosophical calm, he meditated, his eyes fixed on the gate.</t2834>
<t2835>You see, Jeremías, what the world is like!—Lapa said to himself.</t2835><t2836>—Not long ago you saw with your own eyes that Cly, young, robust, brimming with life, and now...</t2836>
<t2837>After smoking his pipe, and after a considerable amount of time spent in deep meditations and sad reflections, he got up and started back to the city, intending to be at his post before the Bank's closing time.</t2837> <t2838>It has not been entirely possible to clarify whether his meditations had a pernicious influence on his liver, or if his health had already been deteriorating beforehand, or if his visit had no other purpose than to bestow an honor upon the person he visited: whatever the cause, the fact was that, on the way, he stopped for a few minutes at his doctor's house... the eminent veterinarian of the city.</t2838>
<t2839>The son expressed to the father with great interest that nothing had happened during his absence.</t2839> <t2840>The Bank closed the day's operations, the employees left, and Lapa, accompanied by his son, headed home.</t2840>
<t2841>—Today you will know who I am—he said to his wife as soon as he crossed the threshold of the house.</t2841><t2842>—If tonight I am in a bad mood like an honest tradesman, it will be proof that you have spent the day praying against me, and you will know what's what, just as if I had seen you dragged across the floor with my own eyes.</t2842>
<t2843>His rib moved its head.</t2843>
<t2844>—What! Do you dare to do it right under my nose?—he replied with an angry tone.</t2844>
<t2845>—If I don't say anything!</t2845>
<t2846>—I already know; but you think!</t2846> <t2847>Thinking is just as bad as talking!</t2847> <t2848>You can ruin me just the same by praying as by meditating!</t2848> <t2849>I don't want you to do either!</t2849>
<t2850>—Alright, Jeremías.</t2850>
<t2851>—Yes!...</t2851> <t2852>Alright, Jeremías...</t2852> <t2853>Perfectly, Jeremías... Agreed, Jeremías...</t2853> <t2854>Whatever you say, Jeremías...</t2854> <t2855>You think you can fool me with those words of agreement, don't you?</t2855> <t2856>Well, you are completely mistaken!</t2856>
<t2857>—Are you planning to go out tonight?—asked the woman.</t2857>
<t2858>—Yes; I plan to go out.</t2858>
<t2859>—May I accompany you, father?—asked his child.</t2859>
<t2860>—You won't be able to accompany me.</t2860> <t2861>Tonight I am going... your mother already knows... I am going fishing; fishing; that's it.</t2861>
<t2862>—Every day the fish are getting smarter, aren't they, father?</t2862>
<t2863>—It's none of your business.</t2863>
<t2864>—Will he bring fish?</t2864>
<t2865>—If I don't bring it, there will be a general uproar at home tomorrow—replied Lapa, shaking his head.</t2865><t2866>—And enough with the questions, kid.</t2866> <t2867>I won't leave until you have gone to bed.</t2867>
<t2868>The rest of the evening he devoted to watching his wife and forcing her to talk constantly in order to prevent her from praying or meditating against him.</t2868> <t2869>With the same objective in mind, he also forced his son to chat endlessly with his mother, much to her displeasure, as she did not have a single second to devote to her reflections.</t2869> <t2870>The most devout person could not have paid a more eloquent tribute to the efficacy of an honest prayer.</t2870> <t2871>His fear of his wife's prayers was as if a person who swore up and down that they did not believe in ghosts or apparitions were horrified upon hearing ghost and apparition stories.</t2871>
<t2872>—It's a big deal that your prayers are a constant threat to our stomachs!—said Lapa.</t2872><t2873>—Your unnatural behavior would starve your husband and your son if I weren't watching over them all the time.</t2873> <t2874>Look at your son...!</t2874> <t2875>Because I believe he is your son, right?</t2875> <t2876>He's thinner than a rapier...</t2876> <t2877>You, who have the audacity to call yourself his mother, don't you know that the first, the most sacred duty of a mother is to make her son gain weight?</t2877>
<t2878>These words moved the son so deeply that he implored his mother to fulfill, above all else, the maternal role with the same delicacy indicated by his father.</t2878>
<t2879>Thus the evening slipped away in the peaceful home of the Lapas, until mother and son were ordered to go to bed.</t2879> <t2880>The head of the family passed the hours of the night smoking solitary pipes until a little past midnight, when he got up to go out.</t2880> <t2881>Before that, however, he took from a cupboard, whose key he kept in his pocket, a sack, a rather thick iron bar, some ropes, a chain, and other similar fishing tools, which, once placed and arranged conveniently, he turned off the light and left.</t2881>
<t2882>Minutes later, the curious child followed his father, having had the foresight to lie down dressed on the bed when he received the order to retire.</t2882> <t2883>Under the cover of night, he left his room, descended the stairs stealthily, and ventured through the deserted streets.</t2883> <t2884>As for returning to his father's house, he had no fear, for he knew very well that the door remained open all night.</t2884>
<t2885>Driven by the very commendable desire to learn the arts and mysteries of the nocturnal occupations of his honorable father, the boy, sticking to the walls of the houses, immersing himself in the doorways, tried not to lose sight of the hardworking author of his days for an instant.</t2885> <t2886>The latter took a northern direction, and he had not gone very far when he encountered a new disciple of Isaac Walton, in whose company he continued the journey.</t2886>
<t2887>Half an hour later, they both walked without a word along a lonely path, where neither the gaze of the street lamps nor that of the night watchmen could reach.</t2887> <t2888>Another fisherman joined them on the path, but with such discretion and silence that if the boy had been superstitious, he surely would have believed that the man who first joined his father had suddenly and miraculously split into two.</t2888>
<t2889>The three continued their march followed by Lapa's son, until they halted at the foot of an embankment whose slope rose above the path.</t2889> <t2890>On top of the slope, there ran a low brick wall, crowned by an iron fence.</t2890> <t2891>The men slid like ghosts along the slope, trying to take cover in its shadow, until they reached an indentation that gave access to a sort of alley, one side of which, formed by the brick wall, was about ten feet high.</t2891> <t2892>In the whitish light of the moon, the boy could see that the honest tradesman to whom he owed his existence was climbing the iron fence with unparalleled agility.</t2892> <t2893>He was immediately followed by the second fisherman, and then by the third.</t2893> <t2894>The three reached the ground inside the fence, where they remained for a few minutes, lying on the ground... probably listening.</t2894> <t2895>Then they advanced, crawling on their hands and knees.</t2895>
<t2896>The boy approached the gate, holding his breath.</t2896> <t2897>From a corner where he crouched, he saw the three fishermen crawling like snakes through the tall grass that covered the ground... and among many crosses and tombstones.</t2897> <t2898>They were in a cemetery, and they looked like dreadful ghosts being watched by an even more dreadful, more monstrous ghost: the tower of the nearby church, a terrifying giant tasked with guarding the peace of the dead.</t2898> <t2899>They did not advance much further.</t2899> <t2900>The boy soon noticed that they straightened up and began to fish.</t2900>
<t2901>They first fished with a hoe.</t2901> <t2902>Shortly after, the honorable Lapa prepared an instrument similar to an enormous corkscrew.</t2902> <t2903>Whatever fishing tools they used, they handled them with unusual fervor.</t2903> <t2904>The spikes that crowned the boy's head acquired the steely hardness of his father's when the giant guardian of the city of the dead let out slow, resonant, grave, terrifying, the two o'clock in the morning.</t2904>
<t2905>The boy embarked on a reckless escape; but his desire to know was so great that not only did he stop after a short distance, but it also prompted him to return to the gate.</t2905> <t2906>He saw that the three men continued fishing, and assumed they had caught something upon observing that the fishermen seemed bent over and as if doubled, making efforts aimed at pulling out a very heavy fish.</t2906> <t2907>Indeed, it was so: little by little they were hoisting the fish until it surfaced.</t2907> <t2908>The shape of the fish was unmistakable; but when the boy saw that his father was about to open it, he was seized by such panic that he took off in a frantic run, not stopping or slowing down until he had covered more than a mile of ground.</t2908>
<t2909>Not even then would he have stopped if he hadn't run out of breath, for he wasn't fleeing from images conjured by fear, but from specters that were haunting him terribly.</t2909> <t2910>The coffin he had seen was right on his heels, jumping over the stones and dirt of the path in a perpendicular position and on its narrowest end, determined to catch up to him and place itself by his side... perhaps to cling to his arm.</t2910> <t2911>That diabolical coffin must have been a marvel of incongruity and ubiquity, for it would leap among the black rows of trees lining the path as soon as it would fly over the thick treetops, like a kite without a tail or wings.</t2911> <t2912>It also hid in the doorways, against which it rubbed its horrible ribs, producing a sound similar to hollow laughter.</t2912> <t2913>It constantly gained ground on the boy in that fantastic race.</t2913> <t2914>When the pursued reached the door of his house, he was half-dead with fear.</t2914> <t2915>Not even after taking refuge inside did he find himself free from the relentless pursuit of the coffin, which climbed the stairs after him, jumping over the steps, and lay down in his bed, and climbed onto his chest when sleep or terror overcame the unfortunate curious one.</t2915>
<t2916>The presence of Jeremías Lapa in the boy's narrow room ended his restless sleep before the first rays of the sun appeared over the earth.</t2916> <t2917>Fortune must have been unkind to him that night; at least, that is what his son inferred from the fact that he had his wife by the ears and was shaking her without consideration.</t2917>
<t2918>—I offered it to you, and I'm fulfilling it!—said Jeremiah.</t2918>
<t2919>—For God's sake, Jeremiah!—exclaimed his wife with a pleading tone.</t2919>
<t2920>—You insist on ruining my business, without considering that you are harming me and my associates.</t2920> <t2921>Your obligation is to obey: why don't you do it?</t2921>
<t2922>—I strive to be an honorable woman!—replied the unfortunate one, shedding tears.</t2922>
<t2923>—And do you think that honesty consists of ruining your husband's business?</t2923> <t2924>Do you think you honor your husband by dishonoring his affairs?</t2924>
<t2925>—You shouldn't engage in such horrible businesses, Jeremiah!</t2925>
<t2926>—It should be enough for you to be the wife of an honest tradesman and not to let your narrow feminine understanding entertain calculations or judgments about the nature of the business your husband does or does not do.</t2926> <t2927>The woman who is honest and obedient does not meddle in what is the exclusive concern of her husband.</t2927> <t2928>And you call yourself religious?</t2928> <t2929>You call yourself honest?</t2929> <t2930>If you are religious, if you are honest, give me irreligious and dishonorable women!</t2930>
<t2931>The altercation, which was being held in a low voice, came to an end when Jeremiah, removing his mud-covered boots, lay down on the ground, face up with his hands placed under his head as a pillow.</t2931> <t2932>The son, in his desire to imitate the father, lay back down on the bed, soon falling asleep.</t2932>
<t2933>After lunch, which did not include any fish dishes, and one could say no other delicacies either, Mr. Jeremiah, who, by the way, was angrier than ever, well-groomed and washed, went out with his son and took the road to Tellson's Bank.</t2933>
<t2934>The young scion of the honorable tradesman who was walking beside him on Fleet Street was no longer the same person who the previous night had fled in terror along solitary paths from his terrible pursuer.</t2934> <t2935>With the light of day, he regained his usual boldness, and his qualms and scruples ended with the night... in whose particulars it is more than likely that he had many companions on the lively Fleet Street.</t2935>
<t2936>—Father—said the boy during the journey,—what is a gravedigger?</t2936>
<t2937>The good Lapa could not answer such an unexpected question without first standing as if nailed to the spot.</t2937>
<t2938>—How should I know!—he finally replied.</t2938>
<t2939>—I thought you knew everything, Father—replied the candid boy.</t2939>
<t2940>—Hmm! Well... look!—said Jeremías Lapa, after taking off his hat and scratching his forehead.</t2940><t2941>—A gravedigger is an honest craftsman, a tradesman.</t2941>
<t2942>—What line of business are you in?</t2942>
<t2943>—He trades... in scientific goods of a special nature.</t2943>
<t2944>—On human corpses; right, father?</t2944>
<t2945>—I think you're not entirely off track, son.</t2945>
<t2946>—Oh father!</t2946> <t2947>I would like to be a gravedigger when I become a man!</t2947>
<t2948>The proposition filled the father with noble pride.</t2948> <t2949>However, shaking his head as if in doubt, he replied:</t2949>
<t2950>—It will depend on the heights your talents can reach.</t2950> <t2951>Try to encourage their development, to which the example I set will powerfully contribute.</t2951> <t2952>Today it is premature to talk about what you will do or not do in the future.</t2952>
<t2953>Moments later, while the boy was going to place the bench in the shade of the Temple Court building, Jeremías Lapa murmured to himself:</t2953>
<t2954>—Friend Jeremías, honorable craftsman; you can harbor well-founded hopes that your son will, in time, become a treasure that will compensate for your misfortune of having an unnatural wife.</t2954>
<t2955>Chapter XV.</t2955>
<t2956>KNITTING</t2956>
<t2957>That day, at Mr. Defarge's tavern, the libations had begun earlier than usual.</t2957> <t2958>When at six in the morning, pale faces approached the bars of the grates that protected the windows, they saw other pale faces bent over their respective wine cups.</t2958> <t2959>As a general rule, the wine sold at Defarge's tavern had received the healthy waters of baptism, but the wine that these early Bacchic drinkers were consuming on this occasion must have been sour, or at least had the property of souring the temperament of those who drank it.</t2959> <t2960>The juice of the grapes contained in Defarge's barrels did not ignite cheerful Bacchic flames, but a latent fire, a fire that burned without coming to the surface.</t2960>
<t2961>Three mornings had already passed since the sacrifices to Bacchus began very early in Defarge's tavern.</t2961> <t2962>They started on Monday and now it was Wednesday.</t2962> <t2963>It is true that there was more talking and listening than drinking, for there was no shortage of early risers who entered the establishment as soon as the door opened, and for whom it would have been impossible to place a coin on the counter, even if their soul's salvation depended on it.</t2963> <t2964>Nevertheless, they showed the same contentment as if they had been served entire barrels of wine; you could see them moving from one bench to another, shifting from one corner to another, eagerly swallowing paragraphs of conversation instead of savoring sips of wine.</t2964>
<t2965>Although the crowd was larger than usual, the innkeeper had not considered it necessary to make himself visible.</t2965> <t2966>The patrons should not have given importance to Defarge's absence, since no one asked about him, no one showed a desire to see him, no one was surprised to see Mrs. Defarge alone, sitting behind the counter, overseeing the distribution of wine and collecting counterfeit coins, from which the images and crests stamped by the die had disappeared.</t2966> <t2967>They were coins worthy of the ragged pockets from which they had come.</t2967>
<t2968>Boredom, absolute lack of interest, and an excess of annoyance were the only things that the spies, who undoubtedly watched from the street as they watched all places, high and low, from the king's palace to the criminal's cell, would have noticed in the tavern.</t2968> <t2969>The playing cards languished, the domino players built castles with the tiles, the drinkers drew faces on the tables with the drops of wine that fell from the cups, and Mrs. Defarge followed the patterns on her sleeve with a toothpick, as if she heard something that did not strike her eardrums and saw things that did not impress her retina.</t2969>
<t2970>Until noon, the characteristics of San Antonio in its wine-like aspect did not change at all.</t2970> <t2971>Shortly after twelve, two men covered in dust arrived, one of whom was Mr. Defarge, and the other a road worker, both with stern and thirsty expressions, who entered the tavern.</t2971> <t2972>Their arrival ignited in the heart of San Antonio burning sparks that, spreading outside the tavern, soon turned into flames, and these in turn into human faces that filled all the doors and windows of the neighborhood.</t2972> <t2973>No one followed the dusty travelers, no one addressed a single word to them, but everyone fixed their eyes on them.</t2973>
<t2974>—Good morning!—answered a large chorus.</t2974>
<t2975>—Bad weather, gentlemen—replied Defarge, shaking his head.</t2975>
<t2976>Each of those present looked at their neighbor, and then, everyone lowered their eyes to the ground and remained silent.</t2976> <t2977>Only one, as an exception, got up from their seat and left.</t2977>
<t2978>—My dear wife—continued Defarge,—I have traveled a portion of leagues in the company of this good walker, whose name is Santiago.</t2978> <t2979>I found him... by chance, a day and a half from Paris.</t2979> <t2980>He is a good boy and his name is Santiago...</t2980> <t2981>Give him a drink, dear!</t2981>
<t2982>Another man stood up and left the tavern.</t2982> <t2983>Mrs. Defarge served a glass of wine to the good road worker, who greeted her by taking off the blue cap that covered his head, and drank.</t2983> <t2984>He took a piece of rough, black bread from his bosom, sat down next to the counter, and began to eat and drink.</t2984> <t2985>Another patron, the third one, stood up and left the tavern.</t2985>
<t2986>Defarge served himself another glass of wine, smaller than the one served to the road-mender, and waited for him to finish his refreshment.</t2986> <t2987>He neither looked at any of those present, nor did any of those present look back at him.</t2987> <t2988>Madame Defarge had taken the knitting in her hands and worked without looking up and without speaking.</t2988>
<t2989>—Have you finished lunch already?—asked the innkeeper to the laborer after noticing that he wasn't eating.</t2989>
<t2990>—Yes; thank you very much.</t2990>
<t2991>—Then, let's go: I will show you the room I mentioned you would occupy, and which I certainly assure you will be to your liking.</t2991>
<t2992>From the shop, they went out to the street, from the street they entered a courtyard, in the courtyard they took a staircase, and at the end of the staircase they found an attic... which was once the dwelling of a man with hair as white as snow, who spent his days sitting on a stool and making shoes.</t2992>
<t2993>The one with hair as white as snow was not in the attic, but the three men who had previously left the tavern one by one were.</t2993>
<t2994>Defarge carefully closed the door of the garret, and said in a low voice:</t2994>
<t2995>—Santiago First, Santiago Second, Santiago Third!</t2995> <t2996>I present to you the witness found by me, Santiago Fourth.</t2996> <t2997>He will tell you everything.</t2997> <t2998>You may speak, Santiago Fifth.</t2998>
<t2999>The road worker, after drying his sweaty forehead with the blue cap he held in his hand, asked:</t2999>
<t3000>—Where do I start?</t3000>
<t3001>—You can start at the beginning—replied Defarge very logically.</t3001>
<t3002>—I saw him, gentlemen—began the road worker,—it was a year ago this summer, under the carriage of the Marquis, hanging from the chain.</t3002> <t3003>I had just finished my task, the sun was setting on the horizon, the Marquis's carriage was laboriously climbing the hill, and he was hanging from the chain like this.</t3003>
<t3004>The speaker graphically depicted a scene that he had represented thousands of times in the village over an entire year.</t3004>
<t3005>Santiago Primero took the floor to ask the traveler if he had seen the man hanging from the chain before.</t3005>
<t3006>—Never—replied the one being questioned, regaining an upright position.</t3006>
<t3007>Santiago Tercero asked how he had been able to recognize him later, having not seen him until that day.</t3007>
<t3008>—I recognized him by his tall stature—said the road worker, placing the index finger of his right hand on his nose.</t3008><t3009>—When that night the Marquis asked what signs he had, I replied: "He is tall like a specter."</t3009>
<t3010>—You should have said "small as a dwarf," observed Santiago Segundo.</t3010>
<t3011>—And what did I know?</t3011> <t3012>The feat had not been committed, nor had he confided in me.</t3012> <t3013>But keep in mind that, even under those circumstances, I declared nothing, said nothing.</t3013> <t3014>A good proof of this is that the Marquis, pointing at me with his finger, shouted: "Bring me that scoundrel!" No, no, gentlemen!</t3014> <t3015>I said nothing!</t3015>
<t3016>—You are right, Santiago—said Defarge.</t3016><t3017>—Continue.</t3017>
<t3018>—Well then—continued the road worker with an air of mystery.</t3018><t3019>—The tall man has gone missing and they are looking for him... since when?</t3019> <t3020>Since nine, ten, eleven months?</t3020>
<t3021>—The number of months is the least relevant thing—replied Defarge.</t3021><t3022>—He was well hidden, but in the end, they unfortunately found him.</t3022><t3023>Continue.</t3023>
<t3024>—Once again I am working on the hillside and the sun is also setting behind the Western mountains, just like the previous time.</t3024> <t3025>I gather my tools to go down to the village, where night has already fallen, when, as I lift my eyes, I see six soldiers appear at the top of the hill.</t3025> <t3026>In the midst of the soldiers, I see a man with his arms tied to his sides... in this manner.</t3026>
<t3027>With the help of his indispensable blue hat, the speaker admirably represents a man whose elbows are tied to his waist.</t3027>
<t3028>—I step aside, gentlemen, positioning myself next to a pile, to watch the soldiers and their prisoner pass by, as it is a military road where nothing passes that is not worth watching, and when they approached, at first, I saw nothing but six soldiers escorting a bound man, a tall man, and that both soldiers and prisoner appeared black, except for the part facing the sunset, where I noticed some reddish lines.</t3028> <t3029>I also observed that the shadows cast by their bodies crossed the road in its entirety, as if they were the shadows of giants.</t3029> <t3030>I also saw that they were covered in dust, and that they raised clouds of dust as they marched.</t3030> <t3031>When they passed in front of me, I recognized the tall man they had as a prisoner, and he recognized me as well.</t3031> <t3032>Ah! I well know that the prisoner would have thrown himself headfirst down the hillside as he did the afternoon I first saw him in the same place!</t3032>
<t3033>Next, he gave a detailed and vivid description of the scene he had just mentioned.</t3033>
<t3034>—Neither did I let the soldiers understand that I had recognized the prisoner, nor did the prisoner let the soldiers see that he had recognized me.</t3034> <t3035>Instead, we conveyed it to each other through the language of the eyes.</t3035> <t3036>“Alive, alive!” said the leader of the soldiers.</t3036><t3037>—“Let’s take him quickly to the pit!”; and indeed, they quickened their pace.</t3037> <t3038>I followed them.</t3038> <t3039>The prisoner’s arms were swollen due to the brutal pressure of the ropes, and since his clogs were too big and very heavy, he walked with a limp.</t3039> <t3040>One who limps cannot walk quickly, and since the soldiers wanted to make the journey swiftly, they drove the prisoner in this manner.</t3040>
<t3041>The road worker imitated the movements of the man who is forced to walk with rifle butts.</t3041>
<t3042>—The prisoner fell flat on his face while they ran down the slope like madmen.</t3042> <t3043>The soldiers burst out laughing and lifted him up.</t3043> <t3044>His face was bleeding and covered in dirt, but the poor man couldn't bring his hands to it, which, seen by the soldiers, led to more laughter.</t3044> <t3045>They took him to the village, which came out en masse to see him, and from the village to the mill, and from the mill to the dungeon.</t3045> <t3046>The entire village saw how the dungeon door opened and swallowed the prisoner in this manner:</t3046>
<t3047>The road worker opened an enormous mouth, and closed it with a clatter produced by his teeth clashing violently.</t3047> <t3048>He wanted to represent the scene with such verisimilitude that he continued with his mouth closed until Defarge, after a long wait, said:</t3048>
<t3049>—Go ahead, Santiago.</t3049>
<t3050>—The entire village withdraws,—continued the traveler, lowering his voice and standing on his tiptoes,—the entire village gathers around the fountain and speaks; the entire village retreats to their beds; the entire village dreams of that unfortunate one, who is found between walls and irons, locked in the dungeon that rises at the edge of the cliff, from which he will only emerge to die.</t3050> <t3051>The next morning, I throw my tools over my shoulders, take a piece of black bread, and taking a detour, pass by the prison before heading to work.</t3051> <t3052>There I see him, behind the sturdy bars of that iron cage, covered in blood and dust, just as he was the night before.</t3052> <t3053>He cannot extend a hand to me, because none have been left free; I do not dare to call out to him nor does he dare to speak to me; his appearance is that of a dead man.</t3053>
<t3054>Both Defarge and the three listeners exchange grim looks, looks that breathe hatred and vengeance, as they listen to the story from the lips of the traveler.</t3054> <t3055>The attitude of the three, although reserved, is authoritative, as if they constituted a very severe tribunal.</t3055> <t3056>The First and Second Santiagos are seated on the old mattress, their respective chins resting on their hands and their eyes fixed on the narrator.</t3056> <t3057>The Third Santiago has one knee on the ground and continuously passes his nervous hand over his mouth and nose, while Defarge, standing between the group formed by the three Santiagos and the narrator, sometimes looks at the latter, sometimes turns his severe face towards the former.</t3057>
<t3058>—Go ahead, Santiago—says Defarge.</t3058>
<t3059>—In that iron cage, they have him locked up for a number of days.</t3059> <t3060>The village sees him, but cautiously, for they are afraid.</t3060> <t3061>During the day, they watch the prison from afar, and at night, when the day's work is done and they gather by the fountain, all faces turn towards the jail.</t3061> <t3062>Before, the object of the entire village's gaze was the post house: today it is the prison.</t3062> <t3063>In the conversations that the village holds by the fountain, they say that even if he were sentenced to death, the sentence would not be carried out; they say that petitions have been presented in Paris demonstrating that the unfortunate man went mad and did not know what he was doing as a result of his son's tragic death; they say that a petition has been presented to the King himself...</t3063> <t3064>Who knows?</t3064> <t3065>It could be!</t3065> <t3066>I do not claim either yes or no.</t3066>
<t3067>—Listen carefully, Santiago!—interrupted Santiago Primero with a harsh tone.</t3067><t3068>—Know that a petition has been presented to the King and Queen.</t3068> <t3069>Everyone here, except for you, knows that the King took it in his hands while he was riding in a carriage down the street, seated next to the Queen.</t3069> <t3070>Defarge, whom you are seeing, risked his life to stand in front of the horses holding the petition in his hand.</t3070>
<t3071>—Listen to me now, Santiago!—interjected Santiago Tercero, always with one knee on the ground and waving his nervous fingers.</t3071><t3072>—The escort, both on foot and on horseback, fell upon the supplicant and bruised him with blows!</t3072> <t3073>Do you understand?</t3073>
<t3074>—I understand, gentlemen.</t3074>
<t3075>—Go ahead, then—said Defarge.</t3075>
<t3076>—There are also people who claim that he has been brought to our country to be executed here, and that he will inevitably be executed.</t3076> <t3077>They also say that, since he killed the lord, and the lord is the father of his vassals, he will be executed as a parricide.</t3077> <t3078>An old man says that they will burn his right hand alive, armed with a knife; that in the wounds they will open on his arms, chest, and legs, they will pour boiling oil, molten lead, burning resin, wax, and sulfur, and finally, that tied to the tails of four horses, he will be torn apart.</t3078> <t3079>The same old man claims that this is what they did to a criminal who attempted against the life of our late King Louis XV.</t3079> <t3080>Could it be true?</t3080> <t3081>Could it be false?</t3081> <t3082>I don't know: I am not wise.</t3082>
<t3083>—Listen again, Santiago!—exclaimed the third of this name.</t3083><t3084>—The convict you speak of was named Damiens, and the program you just described was carried out in broad daylight and on the streets of Paris.</t3084> <t3085>Regarding the impression it made on those who witnessed it, I will only tell you, Santiago, that the multitude of ladies of the highest nobility who came to witness the execution did not want to miss any detail; they watched it with rapture until the end... until the end, Santiago, which did not come until nightfall, hours after the unfortunate man had lost two legs and an arm... and he was still breathing!</t3085> <t3086>That happened...</t3086> <t3087>But tell me, how old are you?</t3087>
<t3088>—Thirty-five—replied the road worker, who looked sixty.</t3088>
<t3089>—Too many!—murmured Defarge impatiently.</t3089><t3090>—Continue.</t3090>
<t3091>—They talk about nothing else in the village: even the fountain seems to have learned the same refrain.</t3091> <t3092>Finally, on a Sunday night, the soldiers arrive and head to the prison.</t3092> <t3093>Workers digging, workers hammering, soldiers laughing out loud, and when day breaks, a forty-foot-high gallows stands next to the fountain, whose shadow poisons the waters.</t3093> <t3094>Everyone stops working, everyone gathers there, the cows don't go out to the field because they don't want to miss the spectacle either.</t3094> <t3095>At noon, the drums thunder.</t3095> <t3096>The soldiers, who went to the prison the night before, return with him in the middle.</t3096> <t3097>The convict is tied up, they have put a gag in his mouth secured with a rope in such a way that it looks like he is smiling.</t3097> <t3098>At the top of the gallows, they have placed a knife with its point facing up.</t3098> <t3099>The convict is hanged forty feet high, and his corpse remains swinging... poisoning the fountain's waters with its shadow.</t3099>
<t3100>The listeners exchanged somber looks, while the narrator wiped the sweat from his face with the blue cap.</t3100>
<t3101>—It's horrifying, gentlemen!—he replied.</t3101><t3102>—How are the women and children supposed to drink water from the fountain?</t3102> <t3103>Who is the daring one that dares to speak during the night under that shadow? Under the shadow, I said?</t3103> <t3104>When I left the village on Monday afternoon, almost at sunset, I turned my head from the top of the hill and saw that the shadow covered the church, covered the mill, covered the prison on the cliff, covered all the land, gentlemen, that has the blue sky as its roof!</t3104>
<t3105>The listener who was kneeling on the ground seemed to be hungry for something... that was neither food nor drink.</t3105>
<t3106>—I have finished, gentlemen.</t3106> <t3107>I left the village moments before sunset, as I just mentioned, and walked all night and half of the following day, until I found, as I also mentioned, this comrade.</t3107> <t3108>In his company, I arrived here, sometimes on foot, sometimes on horseback, traveling all the rest of yesterday and all of last night.</t3108> <t3109>I have spoken.</t3109>
<t3110>—Alright—said Santiago Primero, after an imposing silence.</t3110><t3111>—You have acted and narrated faithfully.</t3111> <t3112>Would you like to wait for us briefly outside, on the stairs?</t3112>
<t3113>—With great pleasure—replied the road worker.</t3113>
<t3114>Defarge accompanied him to the staircase, left him sitting on the last step, and went back into the attic.</t3114> <t3115>The three Jacques had stood up and formed a very tight group.</t3115>
<t3116>—What do you say, Santiago?—asked the number one of this name.</t3116><t3117>—Shall we record it in our register?</t3117>
<t3118>—Register him as condemned to destruction!—replied Defarge.</t3118>
<t3119>—Magnificent!—exclaimed Santiago Tercero.</t3119>
<t3120>—The castle and the entire lineage?—replied the first one.</t3120>
<t3121>—Yes; the castle and the entire race!—roared Defarge—Complete extermination!</t3121>
<t3122>—Sublime!—shouted the third Santiago.</t3122>
<t3123>—Are you certain that the system we've agreed upon for the registry won't cause us any trouble?—Santiago Primero asked Defarge.</t3123><t3124>—That it is secure, there is no doubt, since, except for us, no one is capable of deciphering it: but will we always be able to decipher it... or rather, will she be able to?...</t3124>
<t3125>—Santiago—replied Defarge, standing up,—if my wife insists on keeping the entire record in her memory, rest assured that not a single word, not a single syllable of what it contains will be lost.</t3125> <t3126>With knitting needles, she is capable of writing everything clearer than the sun.</t3126> <t3127>Trust my wife.</t3127> <t3128>The most cowardly poltroon, the most attached to the world who lives or has lived under the sky's cover, would find it easier to take his own life than to remove a single letter from the record written stitch by stitch by my lady.</t3128>
<t3129>Murmurs of approval greeted Defarge's words.</t3129>
<t3130>—What do we do with that rustic?—asked Santiago Tercero.</t3130><t3131>—Do we fire him?</t3131> <t3132>It seems excessively simple to me: won't it be dangerous for us?</t3132>
<t3133>—He knows nothing—replied Defarge,—and the little he could say would only serve to get him to a scaffold as high as the one he was just describing to us.</t3133> <t3134>I'll take care of him; leave him to me.</t3134> <t3135>In due time, I'll let him go.</t3135> <t3136>It seems he wishes to see the King, the Queen, the magnates, and the lords of the court: we will allow him to satisfy his desire on Sunday.</t3136>
<t3137>—What!—exclaimed Santiago Tercero.</t3137><t3138>—Don't you think it's a bad sign that he wants to see the royalty and the nobility?</t3138>
<t3139>—Santiago—replied Defarge,—show the cat the milk if you want to excite its thirst; show the mastiff its natural prey if you want it to fall upon it and tear it apart in due time.</t3139>
<t3140>Nothing more was said at that time.</t3140> <t3141>The road worker, whom they found nodding off on the landing, was invited to lie down on the mattress.</t3141> <t3142>He did not need to be asked twice, and moments later, he was sleeping like a log.</t3142>
<t3143>Worse lodging than what Defarge's tavern offered could not have been found in Paris by an unfortunate like the wayfarer.</t3143> <t3144>If we disregard the mysterious fear that the tavern keeper's wife inspired in him, a fear that constantly haunted him, he led a life that could not be more pleasant.</t3144> <t3145>But the fact is that the tavern keeper's wife spent the entire day sitting behind the counter, so indifferent to his presence, so determined not to acknowledge the presence of a stranger in the house, that he wandered around bewildered and suspicious.</t3145>
<t3146>It is not surprising, then, that when Sunday arrived and he learned that the innkeeper's wife would join her husband to accompany him to Versailles, he was not at all pleased with the plan, although his tongue said otherwise.</t3146> <t3147>His bewilderment increased when the innkeeper's wife did not stop knitting during the journey, and his bewilderment turned into horrible confusion that afternoon when, while waiting for the Queen to pass by, he had to remain next to the innkeeper's wife, whose hands were handling the knitting needles with true fervor.</t3147>
<t3148>—Do you work a lot, ma'am?—said a man who passed by her side.</t3148>
<t3149>—Yes—replied Madame Defarge,—I have much to do.</t3149>
<t3150>—And what do you do, ma'am?</t3150>
<t3151>—Many things.</t3151>
<t3152>—For example...</t3152>
<t3153>—For example—replied the innkeeper with the same calm as before—shrouds.</t3153>
<t3154>The stranger moved away as soon as he could.</t3154><t3155>The poor road worker felt such a strange oppression in his chest that he had to fan himself with his cap.</t3155><t3156>If for his complete recovery he needed the presence of two crowned heads, it must be admitted that he could not complain about his luck, since moments later, a king with large jaws and a queen with a beautiful face appeared, comfortably seated in a golden carriage.</t3156><t3157>With the sovereigns came the best, the most notable of their court.</t3157><t3158>The poor road worker, upon seeing that charming army of smiling ladies and brilliant gentlemen, all covered in silks and lace, blondes and rich velvets, gold braid and dazzling jewelry, felt such waves of enthusiasm in his chest that, shouting at the top of his lungs, he cheered for the King and the Queen, the ladies and gentlemen, and even the carriages and the horses that pulled them.</t3158><t3159>And he saw beautiful gardens and charming groves, and magnificent terraces and marvelous fountains, and he found the King and the Queen again, and cheered, until he was hoarse, for everything created, and his enthusiasm grew, and the enthusiasm gave birth to sympathy in his soul, and the sympathy to tenderness, and this, finding the limits of his chest too narrow, overflowed in torrents through his eyes in the form of tears.</t3159><t3160>During the scene, which lasted three hours, during which he shouted until he was hoarse and cried until he exhausted the source of his tears, Defarge had to hold him by the neck with one hand to prevent him from, in his thoughtless enthusiasm, falling upon the objects of his fleeting devotion and destroying them with his big hands.</t3160>
<t3161>—Bravo!—exclaimed Defarge when the parade ended.</t3161><t3162>—You are a good boy.</t3162>
<t3163>The truck driver, who was beginning to come to his senses, feared he had made a blunder, but soon calmed down.</t3163>
<t3164>—You are the man we need—Defarge said to him, pressing his lips to his ears.</t3164><t3165>—You will make those fools believe that their madness will last forever; their insolence will grow, and they themselves will hasten their end.</t3165>
<t3166>—Quiet!—exclaimed the road worker.</t3166><t3167>—Well, it's true!</t3167>
<t3168>—They are idiots and blind.</t3168> <t3169>They deeply despise you; they would watch your death and that of a thousand more like you with indifference; moreover, they would sacrifice those thousand lives without remorse in exchange for saving just one of their horses or dogs, and yet, they are puffed up by your screams.</t3169> <t3170>Let's deceive them for some more time, for no matter how great the deception is, it will never be as great as they deserve.</t3170>
<t3171>Mrs. Defarge looked at the road-mender and made approving gestures.</t3171>
<t3172>—Tell me, my friend: if they placed a huge pile of beautiful dolls in front of you and told you that you could destroy and strip the ones you fancied, isn't it true that you would choose the richest, the most beautiful ones?</t3172>
<t3173>—It is true, madam.</t3173>
<t3174>—Very well.</t3174> <t3175>And if they showed you a flock of birds with beautiful plumage, unable to take flight, and gave you permission to pluck their feathers for your own benefit, wouldn't you start with the ones that had the most beautiful feathers?</t3175>
<t3176>—That's right, ma'am.</t3176>
<t3177>—Well, you just saw the pile of beautiful dolls and the flock of brightly colored birds: now, let's go home.</t3177>
<t3178>Chapter XVI.</t3178>
<t3179>MORE STITCHES PER INCH</t3179>
<t3180>While Mrs. Defarge and her husband were returning in friendly company to the center of San Antonio, a blue cap was advancing, piercing the darkness and wrapped in thick clouds of dust along the roads leading to the place where the castle of the Marquis, at that time sleeping the eternal sleep, listened to the whispering conversations of the trees.</t3180> <t3181>The stone faces had plenty of time to listen to the conversations held by the trees and the fountain, and they took such interest in it that the skeletons that populated the village and roamed the vicinity of the castle in search of some herbs to quell their hunger and some logs to feed the fire of their cold homes, if they happened to see the courtyard, double staircase, and terrace of the castle, they allowed their famished imagination to entertain the idea that the expression of the stone faces had undergone a profound alteration.</t3181> <t3182>The wretched villagers assured that the expression of pride and disdain of the stone guardians of the castle turned into an expression of pain and anger when the knife struck the House, and they assured that from the moment the body of the murderer swung forty feet above the ground, the expression of pain and anger of those stone faces was replaced by one that breathed fierce vengeance, which would endure in them until the end of time.</t3182> <t3183>The stone face that watched over the large window of the bedroom where the murder had been committed appeared one day with two fine nicks on its nose; and if ever, from among a group of ragged villagers, two or three stood out to approach the petrified Marquis, not a minute of contemplation would pass without them fleeing scared like hares pursued by agile greyhounds.</t3183>
<t3184>Castle and huts, stone faces and flesh-and-blood faces, castle courtyard slabs stained red and pure waters enclosed in the village well, thousands of hectares of land... an entire province of France...</t3184> <t3185>all of France, sleep under the immense bluish vault, as if they were an imperceptible point, an atom lost in the immensity.</t3185> <t3186>The world is nothing else, with all its greatness and insignificance, in relation to the brilliant star that twinkles above.</t3186> <t3187>The wise men of the earth break, divide, decompose a ray of light and analyze its components; and in the same way, another intelligence more sublime than the human reads the weak glimmers that emanate from this earth we inhabit, and analyzes all thoughts and all actions, all vices and all virtues of the creatures endowed with intelligence.</t3187>
<t3188>The public carriage in which the Defarges, husband and wife, made their return journey stopped at the gate of the city closest to their home, where the usual lanterns soon appeared, tasked with conducting the customary examinations and investigations.</t3188> <t3189>Defarge jumped out of the carriage upon seeing two or three soldiers and a policeman he knew; the latter, with whom he had close ties of friendship, embraced him.</t3189>
<t3190>Arriving at the boundaries of the district placed under the protection of the wings of Saint Anthony, the Defarges left the carriage and walked to their house on foot, through dark and muddy streets.</t3190> <t3191>On the way, Mrs. Defarge asked her husband:</t3191>
<t3192>—What did Santiago the police officer tell you?</t3192>
<t3193>—Everything he knows, even though it is very little.</t3193> <t3194>They have appointed another spy for our neighborhood: maybe it's not the only one, but that one only knows about one.</t3194>
<t3195>—Alright—replied the innkeeper with her usual calm.</t3195><t3196>—It will have to be noted in the register.</t3196> <t3197>What is that man's name?</t3197>
<t3198>—It's English.</t3198>
<t3199>—Even better! Your name?</t3199>
<t3200>—Barsad.</t3200>
<t3201>—Barsad.</t3201> <t3202>—Perfect! What is your first name?</t3202>
<t3203>—Juan.</t3203>
<t3204>—Juan Barsad...</t3204> <t3205>Juan Barsad—repeated the innkeeper.</t3205><t3206>—Very well.</t3206> <t3207>Your address?</t3207>
<t3208>—About forty years old, around five feet nine inches tall, black hair, sallow complexion, black eyes, thin, aquiline nose, but not straight: it has the peculiarity of being slightly twisted to the left, which naturally gives him a sinister expression.</t3208>
<t3209>—It's a perfect likeness, upon my word!—exclaimed Madame Defarge, laughing.</t3209><t3210>—I will record it tomorrow.</t3210>
<t3211>Upon arriving at the tavern, which they found closed—it was past midnight—Mrs. Defarge took a seat behind the counter and devoted her attention to examining the day's accounts.</t3211> <t3212>She began by pouring out the jar in which the proceeds of the sales were kept onto the counter, counted the money, measured the inventory, read the entries and exits recorded in the designated book, corrected the entries, made some new ones and discussed others, and after thoroughly scrutinizing and pressuring the individual in charge of the establishment in a thousand ways, she sent him to bed.</t3212> <t3213>Next, she made several equal piles from the coins taken out of the jar, which she tied into her handkerchief, soon turning it into a rosary of knots.</t3213> <t3214>Meanwhile, Defarge walked around the establishment, smoking his pipe and admiring with satisfaction his wife's prudent and wise domestic economy, though without interfering in it.</t3214>
<t3215>Since the shop was narrow, and the ceiling was low, and the night was extremely hot with all the windows and doors closed, the atmosphere was extraordinarily stale.</t3215> <t3216>Mr. Defarge's sense of smell was not a marvel of delicacy, but even so, the vapors of the wine, combined with those of the rum and the brandy, bothered him to such an extent that he tried to keep them away from his nose by snorting and fanning himself with his hands.</t3216>
<t3217>—You are tired, my friend—said his wife, giving him a look while tying up the money.</t3217><t3218>—The smell you breathe here is the same as every day.</t3218>
<t3219>—Indeed; I am tired—replied Defarge.</t3219>
<t3220>—And a little depressed and disheartened—replied the innkeeper's wife, whose piercing eyes, although focused on the accounts, spared one or two glances to examine her husband.</t3220><t3221>—Ah... men!...</t3221>
<t3222>—But...</t3222>
<t3223>—No buts about it—replied the lady with firmness.</t3223><t3224>—I repeat, tonight you are disheartened.</t3224>
<t3225>—It takes so long!—exclaimed Defarge.</t3225>
<t3226>—Does it take so much time?...</t3226> <t3227>And what is it that doesn't require time?</t3227> <t3228>Revenge and justice have always required it!</t3228>
<t3229>—The lightning does not take long to strike a man—observed Defarge.</t3229>
<t3230>—And how long does it take for the necessary electricity to accumulate for the lightning to strike?</t3230> <t3231>Tell me, if you know!</t3231>
<t3232>Defarge raised his head, but did not reply.</t3232>
<t3233>—It takes little time for an earthquake to turn a city to dust.</t3233> <t3234>Well then, how much time is needed to prepare an earthquake?</t3234>
<t3235>—A lot, I suppose—replied Defarge.</t3235>
<t3236>—But when it is ready, when it happens, the city bursts, is pulverized, reduced to impalpable atoms.</t3236> <t3237>Console yourself!</t3237> <t3238>The earthquake is preparing itself even though no one sees it, even though no one hears it.</t3238>
<t3239>With flashing eyes, he tied another knot; it seemed as if he were strangling an enemy.</t3239>
<t3240>—I assure you—he added, extending his right hand as if to give greater expression to his words—that no matter how late it may be, it is on its way, it is approaching by the moment.</t3240> <t3241>I assure you that it always advances, it does not retreat, it does not stop.</t3241> <t3242>Look around you and scrutinize the lives of all the people you know, observe the faces of the entire world, and you will see that the discontent, the rage that roars in the chest of the exploited increases day by day, hour by hour.</t3242> <t3243>And do you think that this state of affairs can last? Bah! You are naive!</t3243>
<t3244>—My dear little wife—replied Defarge, standing up in front of his wife, lowering his head and with his hands behind his back, resembling a docile schoolboy in front of his teacher,—I do not doubt it...</t3244> <t3245>The irritation exists: but it has been around for so long, that it is very possible... that it will not erupt in time for us to witness the cataclysm.</t3245>
<t3246>—And what?—replied the woman.</t3246><t3247>—Even if that were the case, so what?</t3247>
<t3248>—Well... we wouldn't have the joy of savoring the triumph.</t3248>
<t3249>—But indeed, the fact of having contributed to it—said the innkeeper energetically.</t3249><t3250>—Nothing we do will be in vain.</t3250> <t3251>I believe with all my soul that we will see the triumph; but even if I knew for certain that I would not have that joy, as long as there exists the neck of an aristocrat or a tyrant, I will not stop...</t3251>
<t3252>—Calm... calm!—exclaimed Defarge, whose face turned crimson as if he had been accused of being a coward.</t3252><t3253>—Nor will I, my dear, retreat for anything or anyone.</t3253>
<t3254>—I know; but you are weak despite everything, and you are, because to keep your courage from faltering you need to see your victim at your feet.</t3254> <t3255>Try not to falter, even if it seems that the victim is far away.</t3255> <t3256>When the time comes, unleash the tigers and demons you keep locked inside your chest, but in the meantime, keep them chained... hidden, but always ready.</t3256>
<t3257>The good innkeeper finished her advice by slamming a blow on the counter with the handkerchief turned into a heavy rosary; then she lifted it, and with unshakable calm indicated that it was already time to go to bed.</t3257>
<t3258>The next morning, he found that admirable woman in her usual spot, knitting with true fervor.</t3258> <t3259>Beside her, there was a rose to which she occasionally turned her eyes.</t3259> <t3260>Some patrons, standing or sitting, were drinking and chatting.</t3260> <t3261>The day was very hot, and the swarms of flies, which carried their audacity to the extreme of investigating the contents of the glasses near the lady, soon fell dead at the bottom.</t3261> <t3262>Their unfortunate fate did not make the slightest impression on the other flies, who watched them unflinchingly and indifferently until the same misfortune befell them.</t3262> <t3263>How stupid flies are!</t3263>
<t3264>Mrs. Defarge saw the shadow of a person entering the tavern and understood that it was a new customer.</t3264> <t3265>Before looking at the person's face, she placed the knitting on the counter and pinned the rose in her hair.</t3265>
<t3266>The scene that followed could not have been more curious: as soon as the innkeeper's fingers touched the rose, conversations in the establishment ceased and all the patrons began to go out into the street.</t3266>
<t3267>—Good morning, ma'am—said the newcomer.</t3267>
<t3268>—Good morning, sir—replied Mrs. Defarge, taking up her knitting again.</t3268><t3269>—Ah!—she added to herself.</t3269><t3270>—About forty years old, around five feet nine inches tall, black hair, sallow complexion, black eyes, thin, aquiline nose, but not straight, with the particularity of being slightly twisted to the left, which naturally gives a sinister expression... Truly a good day!</t3270>
<t3271>—Would you be so kind as to give me a small glass of old cognac and a sip of fresh water, ma'am?</t3271>
<t3272>The barmaid served what the customer ordered.</t3272>
<t3273>—Delicious cognac, madam!</t3273>
<t3274>As it was the first time she had heard her cognac praised, it is not surprising that the innkeeper suspected that the praise was due to reasons that perhaps were not precisely the quality of the liquor.</t3274> <t3275>She gave thanks, however, and continued knitting.</t3275>
<t3276>The stranger remained for a few moments observing Mrs. Defarge's hands, and in passing, taking note of the establishment.</t3276>
<t3277>—You knit with marvelous speed—he said.</t3277>
<t3278>—The habit... I am very accustomed to this work.</t3278>
<t3279>—And with a perfection that enchants.</t3279>
<t3280>—Do you think so?</t3280>
<t3281>—With all my soul...</t3281> <t3282>And tell me: that stocking is...?</t3282>
<t3283>—Pastime... a means of distraction—replied the innkeeper, looking at her interlocutor with a smile on her lips.</t3283>
<t3284>—Aren't you going to make use of it?</t3284>
<t3285>—According to.</t3285> <t3286>Perhaps the day will come when I use them—said the innkeeper with a certain coquettishness.</t3286><t3287>—Surely I will use them... if I make them well.</t3287>
<t3288>As curious as it may seem, the fact is that the taste of Saint Anthony showed a decided opposition to Mrs. Defarge displaying a rose in her hairstyle.</t3288> <t3289>Two men entered separately, approached the counter with the clear intention of ordering something to drink, and no sooner did they see the rose, they hesitated, looked around as if searching for a friend, whom they did not find, and immediately left.</t3289> <t3290>Of all those who were in the establishment when the one conversing with the landlady entered, not a single one remained: they had all left.</t3290> <t3291>The spy, for readers will have understood by now that the individual in question was a spy, had not managed to catch any signals, even though he had been looking with a hundred eyes since he entered.</t3291>
<t3292>—Juan!—thought Mrs. Defarge, knitting and keeping her eyes on the customer.</t3292><t3293>—If you stay here much longer, I will write Barsad right under your nose.</t3293>
<t3294>—Are you married, ma'am?</t3294>
<t3295>—Yes.</t3295>
<t3296>—With children?</t3296>
<t3297>—Without children.</t3297>
<t3298>—And business, is it going well?</t3298>
<t3299>—Business is very bad.</t3299> <t3300>People are so poor!...</t3300>
<t3301>—Ah, yes! Poor and unfortunate!</t3301> <t3302>And even shamefully oppressed!... as you say.</t3302>
<t3303>—As you say—corrected the barmaid, moving her fingers more quickly and adding something to the surname Barsad.</t3303>
<t3304>—Excuse me: it's true that I was the one who said it, but I have no doubt that you think it.</t3304> <t3305>It can't be anything else.</t3305>
<t3306>—Do I think about it?—replied the innkeeper.</t3306><t3307>—Our establishment causes my husband and me too many headaches for us to afford the luxury of thinking.</t3307> <t3308>The only thing we think about is making sure we have what we need to live.</t3308> <t3309>This is the goal of all our musings, which provides a very broad field for all our thoughts.</t3309> <t3310>Me think for others?</t3310> <t3311>Not in my lifetime!</t3311>
<t3312>The spy, who had entered determined to gather whatever he could, was very careful not to let his sinister face show his disappointment.</t3312> <t3313>On the contrary, he continued leaning on his elbows over the counter, directing the occasional compliment to the barmaid and taking a sip of cognac from time to time.</t3313>
<t3314>—The execution of Gaspard has been a judicial brutality, madam.</t3314> <t3315>Poor Gaspard!—she exclaimed, letting out a sigh.</t3315>
<t3316>—We do not agree—replied the innkeeper coldly.</t3316><t3317>—It is only fair that those who allow their knives to be used as Gaspard used his, should pay for it.</t3317> <t3318>He knew perfectly well the price at which such luxuries are paid, and he has paid it: nothing more natural.</t3318>
<t3319>—I believe—added the spy, lowering his voice and as if inviting his interlocutor to enter the realm of confidences, while giving his sinister face a resolutely revolutionary expression,—I believe that this whole neighborhood sympathizes with the fate of the unfortunate man and roars with fury against those who have sacrificed him.</t3319> <t3320>Just between the two of us, I find it justified.</t3320>
<t3321>—But does that fury exist?</t3321>
<t3322>—Haven't you noticed?</t3322>
<t3323>—Here is my husband—said Mrs. Defarge.</t3323>
<t3324>No sooner had the innkeeper entered the establishment, the spy greeted him by touching his hat and saying with an insinuating smile:</t3324>
<t3325>—Good morning, Santiago.</t3325>
<t3326>Defarge stood rooted to the ground, his eyes fixed on the spy.</t3326>
<t3327>—You are mistaken, my good sir.</t3327><t3328>—You are confusing me with someone else.</t3328> <t3329>My name is not Santiago: I am Ernesto Defarge.</t3329>
<t3330>—It's the same—replied the spy with a smile on his lips, although unable to completely hide his annoyance.</t3330><t3331>—The name is the least of it.</t3331> <t3332>Good morning.</t3332>
<t3333>—Good morning—replied Defarge curtly.</t3333>
<t3334>—I was telling the lady, with whom I have had the honor of chatting for a while, that, according to what I am told, there reigns in the neighborhood... and it does not surprise me... as much sympathy for the unfortunate Gaspard as there is irritation against those who have inhumanely sacrificed him.</t3334>
<t3335>—I have heard no one say such a thing—replied Defarge.</t3335><t3336>—I don't know a word.</t3336>
<t3337>Having said this, he went behind the counter and positioned himself behind his wife.</t3337> <t3338>From the opposite side of the fragile barrier, the couple observed the individual whom they would have shot with the greatest pleasure.</t3338>
<t3339>The spy, skilled in his trade, did not change his attitude of indifference.</t3339> <t3340>He finished the contents of the small glass that had been served to him, took a sip of fresh water, and ordered the second glass of cognac.</t3340> <t3341>Mrs. Defarge served it to him, after which she continued knitting with great fervor and humming a tune.</t3341>
<t3342>—It seems that you know the neighborhood well—observed Defarge;—I mean, you know it better than I do.</t3342>
<t3343>—No, my friend.</t3343> <t3344>I know it very little, but I hope to get to know it well.</t3344> <t3345>Its wretched inhabitants awaken a deep interest in me.</t3345>
<t3346>—Ah!—exclaimed Defarge.</t3346>
<t3347>"The pleasure of conversing with you, Mr. Defarge," continued the spy, "reminds me that I have had the honor of becoming familiar with incidents in which you have taken an active part."</t3347>
<t3348>—Really!—said Defarge indifferently.</t3348>
<t3349>—Nothing more certain.</t3349> <t3350>When Doctor Manette was released, you, who were once his servant, took charge of him.</t3350> <t3351>He was entrusted to you.</t3351> <t3352>So you see, I am well aware of the matter.</t3352>
<t3353>—It's true: you are right—he replied.</t3353>
<t3354>Accidentally, his wife's elbow, which continued to move the needles with great activity, brushed against his, and in the brushing, despite being accidental, Defarge saw an indication that he should answer the spy's questions, but briefly.</t3354>
<t3355>—The doctor's daughter presented herself to you—continued the spy.</t3355><t3356>—She came in the company of a gentleman... what was his name?...</t3356> <t3357>A gentleman who wore a wig... Ah, yes! Lorry...</t3357> <t3358>His name was Lorry... from Tellson's Bank and Company...</t3358> <t3359>She came in the company of Mr. Lorry, took charge of her father's person, and took him to England.</t3359>
<t3360>—That is how it was, indeed—repeated Defarge.</t3360>
<t3361>—One always remembers such incidents with pleasure—replied the spy.</t3361><t3362>—I have met Dr. Manette and his daughter in England.</t3362>
<t3363>—Yes?—asked Defarge.</t3363>
<t3364>—Do you receive news from him frequently?—asked the spy.</t3364>
<t3365>—No—responded Defarge.</t3365>
<t3366>—It's been a very long time since we've heard from them—interjected the innkeeper's wife.</t3366><t3367>—We received news that they had arrived safely, and some time later a letter... maybe two; but then, they continued on their way, we on ours, and our correspondence has completely ceased.</t3367>
<t3368>—That's what usually happens—observed the spy.</t3368><t3369>—The daughter is ready to get married.</t3369>
<t3370>—Is she about to get married?—repeated Madame Defarge.</t3370><t3371>—She is quite beautiful enough to have been married long ago.</t3371> <t3372>Of course, you English are blocks of ice instead of men!</t3372>
<t3373>—Ah! Who told you that I am English?</t3373>
<t3374>—I see that your language is English, and I have always believed that a man is of the same nationality as his language.</t3374>
<t3375>Discovering his nationality did not amuse the spy at all, although he took great care to keep his discontent deep in his chest.</t3375> <t3376>He let out a laugh, finished the contents of his glass, and replied:</t3376>
<t3377>—Well yes, Miss Manette is about to get married, but not to an Englishman, rather to a man who, like her, was born in France.</t3377> <t3378>Speaking of Gaspard!... Poor Gaspard!...</t3378> <t3379>It was cruelty... an act of ferocity!...</t3379> <t3380>Well then, the man Miss Manette is going to marry is the nephew of the Marquis because of whom Gaspard danced at a height of forty feet above the ground; or rather: the current Marquis.</t3380> <t3381>He lives in England under an assumed name, without flaunting the title of Marquis.</t3381> <t3382>He calls himself Charles Darnay; you know that his mother's surname was D'Aulnais.</t3382>
<t3383>Mrs. Defarge had neither eyes nor hands, nor faculties for anything other than the knitting she was doing, but the news had a palpable effect on her husband.</t3383> <t3384>His face reflected intense turmoil, despite his efforts to control himself, his hands trembled, and his inner agitation seeped through every pore of his body.</t3384> <t3385>The spy would not have been worthy of his position if he had not noticed this and committed it to memory.</t3385>
<t3386>Having obtained that result, although without knowing if it could be of any use to him, Mr. Barsad, seeing that no customers were arriving whose conversations might have provided him with valuable information, paid for what he had taken and left, not without expressing, with great politeness, that he would have the pleasure of frequently visiting the establishment.</t3386> <t3387>Minutes later, when the spy had left the area protected by Saint Anthony, husband and wife continued exactly as if the spy had not left the shop, undoubtedly fearing that he might retrace his steps.</t3387>
<t3388>—Could it be true what that man said about Miss Manette?—asked Defarge in a low voice.</t3388>
<t3389>—It is probably a lie; but I do not deny that it could be true—replied the woman.</t3389>
<t3390>—Yes, it is...</t3390>
<t3391>Defarge did not finish his thought.</t3391>
<t3392>—What?—asked the woman.</t3392>
<t3393>—Yes, it is... and given that things come in a way that we can see the triumph... for her, I will wish that Destiny keeps her husband far from France.</t3393>
<t3394>—The fate of your husband will take him where he must go—responded the innkeeper with glacial calm—and it will lead him to the end that is destined for him.</t3394> <t3395>That is all I can tell you.</t3395>
<t3396>—But you will deny that it is very... strange... I say strange for lack of a better word...</t3396> <t3397>don't you find it strange that with all the sympathy we have always had for her father, and even for her herself, you are now condemning her husband with your own hand, based solely on what that hellhound who just left said?</t3397>
<t3398>—Stranger things than that will happen when the day comes—replied Madame Defarge.</t3398><t3399>—I have both of them here; make no mistake; and they will be treated according to their merits.</t3399> <t3400>This should suffice for you.</t3400>
<t3401>Having said these words, she picked up the stocking and removed the rose that adorned her head.</t3401> <t3402>Whether it was that Saint Anthony instinctively knew the hour, the precise moment when the innkeeper would make that innocent flower disappear which seemed to displease him so much, or whether he was watching for the moment of its disappearance, the fact is that the Saint did not take long to appear, and that, within a few seconds, the establishment had regained its usual animation.</t3402>
<t3403>When night fell, during the times of the year when the inhabitants of San Antonio would sit at their doorsteps or gather in streets and courtyards seeking fresh air to breathe, Mrs. Defarge, with her work in hand, would usually go from door to door and from group to group... a kind of missionary like so many others.</t3403> <t3404>All the women would knit, undoubtedly so that this mechanical work would substitute for the jaws, which were forcibly idle most of the time.</t3404> <t3405>Since the jaws and the digestive system could not move, the hands would move.</t3405> <t3406>If the idleness had extended to the fingers, the stomachs would have felt the rigors of hunger more.</t3406>
<t3407>As the fingers moved, so did the eyes and thoughts; and as Madame Defarge went from door to door and from group to group, the fingers of the women she encountered worked with redoubled fervor, their eyes looked with greater fierceness, and the activity of their thoughts increased a hundredfold.</t3407>
<t3408>Her husband smoked by the door of the tavern, watching his life's companion with admiration.</t3408>
<t3409>—A great woman... a strong woman... a sublime woman!—he murmured.</t3409>
<t3410>Night fell; the church bells rang and the distant sound of drums echoed: the women continued knitting.</t3410> <t3411>Another darker night was approaching, another night in which the church bells, which now rang joyfully, would give their bronze to be melted into thundering cannons, in which the drum rolls would thunder through the air to drown out the voice of a condemned man... omnipotent that night, with the omnipotence granted by power and abundance, freedom and life.</t3411> <t3412>The veils of the night enveloped the women who were knitting, just as they would soon envelop that other building, not yet constructed, where they would sit, also knitting but watching and counting at the same time the heads that fell one after another.</t3412>
<t3413>XVII.</t3413>
<t3414>ONE NIGHT</t3414>
<t3415>Neither the tranquil refuge of Soho ever admired such a beautiful sunset as the memorable evening when Doctor Manette and his daughter watched it while sitting under the leafy plane tree that stood in the courtyard of the house, nor did the moon ever rise so radiant and splendid over the city of London as the night that found them sitting under the tree and bathed their faces and heads with a serene light filtered through the leaves.</t3415>
<t3416>Lucía was to be married the next day, and she wanted to dedicate her last night as a single woman to her father: it was due to this circumstance that she was sitting under the plane tree in the company of the author of her days.</t3416>
<t3417>—Are you happy, dear father?</t3417>
<t3418>—Completely, my daughter.</t3418>
<t3419>Although they had been at the mentioned place for some hours before, they had spoken very little.</t3419> <t3420>On other days, when the girl sat under the tree in the company of her father, she worked or read; but on this occasion, even during the time when she had enough light to work or read, she did neither.</t3420> <t3421>The circumstances had changed, and when these change, the routine is interrupted.</t3421>
<t3422>—I am also happy, very happy tonight, my father.</t3422> <t3423>The love that Heaven has blessed makes me happy... my love for Carlos and Carlos's love for me.</t3423> <t3424>However, if I could not continue dedicating my life to you, if my marriage imposed the obligation to separate from you, even if only the width of the street separated our houses, far from considering myself happy, I would feel miserable.</t3424> <t3425>Even so...</t3425>
<t3426>Even so, the emotion eventually completely overwhelmed her.</t3426>
<t3427>In the melancholic light of the moon, she threw her arms around her father's neck and rested her head on his chest.</t3427> <t3428>The light of the moon, which is always sad, just as the light of the sun is sad... just as the light we call human life is sad, which shines today and is extinguished tomorrow, illuminated a simply moving scene.</t3428>
<t3429>—Dear Father!</t3429> <t3430>Are you convinced... firmly convinced, that new loves of mine, new duties of mine, will never come between us?</t3430> <t3431>I am; but what about you?</t3431> <t3432>Does this certainty take root in the depths of your heart?</t3432>
<t3433>—Completely, absolutely convinced!—replied the father with a tone of firm conviction.</t3433><t3434>—Even more so, my daughter!—he added, kissing her.</t3434><t3435>—My future appears brighter in my eyes when seen through your marriage than it would if you remained single.</t3435>
<t3436>—If I could believe you, my father...!</t3436>
<t3437>—Well, believe it, my darling, because it is so.</t3437> <t3438>Think that nothing could be more natural or logical.</t3438> <t3439>If you knew the anxiety that a father feels about the future of a beloved daughter...!</t3439> <t3440>If you could appreciate how great my desires are to prevent contingencies that might make you unhappy...!</t3440>
<t3441>The girl wanted to seal her father's lips with her hand, but he stopped her by taking hold of her hand, and continued thus:</t3441>
<t3442>—Unfortunate, my daughter, yes; torn from the natural order of things... because of me.</t3442> <t3443>Your selflessness, your lack of selfishness, it is not possible for you to understand how much that point has troubled me; but if you ask yourself how my happiness can be complete while yours is incomplete, perhaps you will understand my words.</t3443>
<t3444>—If I had never seen Carlos, my father, you alone would have been enough to make my happiness complete.</t3444>
<t3445>The father couldn't help but smile at that unconscious confession that his daughter would be unhappy without Carlos after having seen him, and he replied:</t3445>
<t3446>—My daughter; you saw a man, and that man was Carlos; if it hadn't been Carlos, it would have been someone else; and if it hadn't been someone else, rest assured that the cause would have been me, in which case, the unfortunate period of my life would not only have enveloped me in its dark shadows, but also someone else, and that someone would have been you.</t3446>
<t3447>It was the first time, after the hearing of Darnay's case, that the doctor alluded to his misfortune.</t3447>
<t3448>—Look at it!—exclaimed Doctor de Beauvais, extending his arm towards the moon and giving his words a tone that his daughter could not forget for a long time.</t3448><t3449>—I have seen it many times from the narrow window of my dungeon, when its light hurt me.</t3449> <t3450>I have gazed at it many times when it caused me such dreadful tortures to think that it shone upon the beings I had lost, that I would have gladly thrown myself headfirst against the walls of my prison.</t3450> <t3451>I have gazed at it while being in such a state of stupor and imbecility, that I could think of nothing else but the number of horizontal lines I could draw on its surface during the full moon, and the number of perpendiculars with which I could intersect the former.</t3451> <t3452>I remember calculating that twenty of each kind could fit—he added pensively—and the twentieth one fit with difficulty.</t3452> <t3453>I have gazed at it thinking millions of times about the son from whom I was violently torn before he was born...</t3453> <t3454>I wondered if he had been born alive, if he was living, if the mother's pain had killed them both.</t3454> <t3455>I wondered if, in the case of being a boy, he would avenge his father, for while I was buried alive, there were times when an intolerable desire for vengeance dominated me; I wondered if he would ever come to know the sad story of his father's days, if perhaps he believed that his father had disappeared freely and voluntarily.</t3455> <t3456>I wondered if, being a daughter, she would grow up to be a woman, and I imagined her completely forgetting me, ignorant of my existence.</t3456> <t3457>In my imagination, I saw her grow, live year after year; I saw her married to a man who was unaware of my sad fate.</t3457> <t3458>I considered myself dead to the world of the living, and I saw the generation following mine in which I did not appear.</t3458>
<t3459>—My father!—exclaimed the young woman, kissing her father with passion.</t3459><t3460>—That daughter to whom your thoughts referred has never existed, but, nevertheless, it almost hurts me as much to hear you speak as you do as if that daughter were me.</t3460>
<t3461>—You, Lucía? Quite the opposite!</t3461> <t3462>Precisely those memories arise from the joy, from the comforts you have brought me, and since they are pleasant memories, I take pleasure in recalling them by the light of the moon on our last night... What was I saying?</t3462>
<t3463>—That your daughter knew nothing about you... that she didn't remember you.</t3463>
<t3464>—It's true; but on other nights, when my sadness and the silence that surrounded me gave my emotions a different direction, when they produced in me something like a painful sensation of peace... like an emotion whose foundation was pain... I imagined my daughter entering my cell, taking me out of the fortress where I was imprisoned, and granting me freedom.</t3464> <t3465>Many, many times I have seen her image in the moonlight, just as I see yours at this moment.</t3465> <t3466>There was, however, a difference, and that is, I could never hold her in my arms, I always saw her cold, motionless, rigid in the center of the cell, in the space between the bars and the door...</t3466> <t3467>You understand that you were not the girl I speak of.</t3467>
<t3468>—It wasn't; that's true... but your imagination made you believe...</t3468>
<t3469>—No; none of that.</t3469> <t3470>My visual organ, disturbed, is clear, I saw her motionless, and yet, the ghost that my intellectual faculties pursued was the ghost of another girl, different and more real.</t3470> <t3471>Of her external appearance, I only know that the image my eyes saw resembled her mother... and the other, the ghost... also resembled her... like you resemble her... but it was a different resemblance.</t3471> <t3472>Do you understand me, Lucia?</t3472> <t3473>No, right?</t3473> <t3474>I highly doubt that anyone who has not spent long centuries confined and separated from their loved ones can understand the subtle distinctions of a prisoner.</t3474>
<t3475>Although the father's calm was perfect, the young woman felt ice running through her veins when she heard him dissect the state of mind he found himself in during times, fortunately past.</t3475>
<t3476>—I imagined her coming to my dungeon by the light of the moon to tell me that her blessed married home was full of sweet memories of her father lost forever.</t3476> <t3477>In her study, my portrait occupied a prominent place and I was the one who inspired her prayers.</t3477> <t3478>Her life was active, happy, useful; but it was filled, saturated with my sad story.</t3478>
<t3479>—That daughter was me, my father.</t3479> <t3480>I was not, by any means, as good as you imagined, but my tender affection was not exaggerated by your fantasy.</t3480>
<t3481>—He also taught his children, to whom he often spoke of me.</t3481> <t3482>All of them had learned to pity me.</t3482> <t3483>When they passed near one of those tombs called state prisons, they would avert their eyes from its grim walls, look fearfully at its bars, and speak in very low voices.</t3483> <t3484>My daughter could not give me freedom; but even so, it was enough for her to show me the things I have just mentioned, for consoling tears to run down my cheeks and for me to fall to my knees blessing her.</t3484>
<t3485>—I am that daughter, yes, I am.</t3485> <t3486>Oh, my father!</t3486> <t3487>Will you bless me tomorrow with the same fervor?</t3487>
<t3488>—I remember those ancient tortures, dear Lucía, because it highlights more and more the joy that overwhelms me tonight.</t3488> <t3489>Never did my hopes, not even when they were most excessive, manage to represent to me a happiness as great as the one I have experienced since being by your side, as the one I hope to savor in the future.</t3489>
<t3490>He then embraced his daughter, solemnly blessed her, and fervently thanked God who had granted her to him.</t3490> <t3491>Shortly after, they entered the house embraced.</t3491>
<t3492>No guests would attend the wedding ceremony, nor would any alterations be made to the doctor's residence because of the marriage.</t3492> <t3493>They had limited themselves to expanding it a bit by taking the upper floor that until then had been occupied by an invisible tenant, which fulfilled their wishes.</t3493>
<t3494>Dr. Manette was very cheerful and lively during dinner.</t3494> <t3495>Three people sat at the table, the third being Miss Pross.</t3495> <t3496>The doctor regretted that they had not invited Charles Darnay; he even felt tempted to scold those who had concocted the plot to keep him away, and he drank to his health.</t3496>
<t3497>It was already very late when he said goodnight to Lucía and retired to his room.</t3497> <t3498>At three in the morning, the young woman, not entirely free from fears and premonitions, got up and quietly entered her father's bedroom.</t3498>
<t3499>Everything was in its place, everything in order, everything calm.</t3499> <t3500>The doctor slept peacefully, his long white hair falling over the pillow and his hands resting naturally on the quilt.</t3500> <t3501>The girl left the candlestick in a corner, approached the bed, and touched her father's withered lips with her fresh ones.</t3501> <t3502>Then she gazed at him intensely.</t3502>
<t3503>The bitter waters of captivity had left their marks on his perfect face; but so firm, so energetic was the resolution of that father, that even while sleeping he managed to conceal them.</t3503> <t3504>In the vast realms of sleep, surely there was no other face that night as guarded against the gaze of any unexpected visitor as that of Doctor Manette.</t3504>
<t3505>Timidly, she placed a hand on that beloved chest and fervently asked God to grant her the ability to always be as faithful to him as his paternal love and past sufferings deserved.</t3505> <t3506>She then withdrew her hand, kissed that adored mouth once more, and left the bedroom.</t3506>
<t3507>When the sun was born, the shadows cast by the banana leaves on her face did not move with as much gentleness as Lucia's lips did when she directed her prayer to Heaven.</t3507>
<t3508>XVIII.</t3508>
<t3509>NINE DAYS</t3509>
<t3510>Nature displayed all its splendor on the wedding day.</t3510> <t3511>All those who were to attend the ceremony were already in place, waiting for the doctor to come out of his room, where he was talking with Charles Darnay.</t3511> <t3512>Next to the indicated room's door were the bride, radiant with beauty, Mr. Lorry, and Miss Pross... for whom the event, thanks to a gradual process of reconciliation with the inevitable, would have been a source of infinite happiness, if not for the slightly painful consideration that the groom should not be Charles Darnay but her brother Solomon.</t3512>
<t3513>—The truth is that I made a great deal!—exclaimed Lorry, who couldn't stop admiring the bride.</t3513><t3514>—Just think about accompanying her on her journey across the Channel for this! My goodness, and how little I thought about what I was doing!</t3514> <t3515>And how little value I placed on the service I rendered to my good friend Charles Darnay on that occasion!</t3515>
<t3516>—I don't know how you could give it more or less value than it deserved if you didn't remotely dream of what was going to happen!—observed Miss Pross.</t3516><t3517>—Nonsense!</t3517>
<t3518>—Really?</t3518> <t3519>Perhaps you are right...</t3519> <t3520>But don't cry—replied Lorry.</t3520>
<t3521>—I am not crying; you are the one who is crying—replied Miss Pross.</t3521>
<t3522>—Me, Pross of my sins?—asked Lorry, who now dared to joke with his interlocutor every now and then.</t3522>
<t3523>—You, yes.</t3523> <t3524>You are crying at this moment, I have seen it, and it is foolish to deny it to me.</t3524> <t3525>Besides, it does not surprise me.</t3525> <t3526>A gift like the one you have given to the young lady is enough to bring tears to the eyes of a stone statue.</t3526> <t3527>What a silver service!</t3527> <t3528>I was crying last night over each of the forks, over each of the spoons in the collection from the moment the case arrived until I could see it opened.</t3528>
<t3529>—What fills me with immense pride, although I swear on my honor that it was not my intention for that small memento to cause anyone suffering.</t3529> <t3530>Devil, devil!</t3530> <t3531>Here is an occasion that forces a man to think with sorrow about what he has lost!</t3531> <t3532>When I remember that fifty years ago there could have been a Mrs. Lorry in the world...!</t3532>
<t3533>—I deny it!—replied Miss Pross.</t3533>
<t3534>—What! Do you think it was impossible for there to have been a Mrs. Lorry?</t3534>
<t3535>—Get out of the way!</t3535> <t3536>You've been single since you were rocked in your cradle!</t3536>
<t3537>—I think it very likely—replied Lorry, adjusting his wig.</t3537>
<t3538>—And before they put him in the cradle, they cut him out to be a lifelong bachelor.</t3538>
<t3539>—In which case, they did very wrong, for they should have listened to my vote before choosing the patron...</t3539> <t3540>I hear the sound of footsteps in the next room, my dear Lucía—he added, wrapping his arm around the bride's waist—and Miss Pross, and I, as formal and business-like people that we are, suspend our dispute, because we do not want to waste the opportunity that presents itself to say a few things to you that you will not dislike hearing.</t3540> <t3541>You are going to leave your father, dear girl, in hands as loving and eager to serve him as yours, in hands that will go out of their way to attend to and care for him during the two weeks that the happy newlyweds are to spend in Warwickshire and its surroundings.</t3541> <t3542>Even Tellson's Bank will metaphorically step back to give way to you.</t3542> <t3543>And when, after the fifteen days, you accompany your dear husband on the trip to Wales, which is to last another fifteen days, you will have to admit that we return him to you happier and more content than when you left him with us...</t3543> <t3544>But someone is approaching the door, and this pretty young lady will allow a hardened bachelor to kiss her before that someone arrives and claims what is his.</t3544>
<t3545>The excellent Lorry spent a good while contemplating that beautiful face, then separated the silky golden curls, which mingled with his chestnut wig, and placed his lips on the smooth forehead with the delicacy with which Adam's contemporaries did these things.</t3545>
<t3546>The door of the doctor's room opened, and he came out followed by Charles Darnay.</t3546> <t3547>A deadly pallor covered the face of the former, in which no traces of color remained, a pallor that did not exist when he was locked in his room with Darnay.</t3547> <t3548>His attitude, however, his expression, remained unchanged, although Lorry's keen eye discovered a certain somber indication that revealed the passage over his soul of the breath of repulsion and hatred that at other times, like a fleeting gust of cold wind, had struck him.</t3548>
<t3549>He gave his arm to his daughter and accompanied her to the carriage that Lorry, in consideration of the solemnity of the day, had rented.</t3549> <t3550>The other people settled in another carriage, and minutes later, Charles Darnay and Lucie Manette were united with sweet and indissoluble bonds in the nearby church.</t3550>
<t3551>In addition to the transparent tears that shone among smiles during the ceremony, some brilliant diamonds of the clearest waters sparkled in the bride's hand, which moments before had been freed from the darkness of one of Mr. Lorry's pockets, where they had been confined.</t3551> <t3552>The newlyweds returned to the house, followed by the small circle of guests, had lunch, and later, the beautiful golden hair that once mingled its strands with the white locks of the poor shoemaker who ardently made shoes in an attic in Paris, came together again with the same, bathed in the morning sun's rays, on the doorstep at the moment of farewell.</t3552>
<t3553>It was a painful separation, although its duration was to be short.</t3553> <t3554>The father encouraged his daughter, gently detached himself from her loving arms, and said with a lively expression:</t3554>
<t3555>—Take it, Carlos! It's yours!</t3555>
<t3556>One minute later, through the window of a departing stagecoach, a hand waving a handkerchief emerged; it was Lucía's hand.</t3556>
<t3557>As the little corner of Soho was shielded from curious eyes and away from places frequented by idlers, and on the other hand, the preparations had been simple and unpretentious, once the newlyweds had left, the doctor, Mr. Lorry, and Miss Pross were completely alone.</t3557> <t3558>When the three of them re-entered the living room, it was then that Lorry noticed the terrible change that had just occurred in the doctor: it seemed as if the arm of the golden giant had struck him with a poisoned blow.</t3558>
<t3559>It was natural that the violent efforts he necessarily had to make to keep his emotion locked within his chest would be followed by a similarly violent reaction as soon as the cause, the occasion for those efforts, disappeared.</t3559> <t3560>It was not, then, the reaction, it was not the flattening, that alarmed Mr. Lorry, but the derangement with which the doctor put his hands on his head, the gloomy monotony with which he began to pace as soon as he entered the room, and those symptoms alarmed him because they reminded him of the attic of Defarge's tavern and the condition in which he found the doctor there.</t3560>
<t3561>—I believe—he said in a very low voice to Miss Pross—that we should not speak to him at this moment nor distract him in any way.</t3561> <t3562>I am going to take a look at the Bank, from where I will return in a moment.</t3562> <t3563>Upon my return, I will take him to the countryside, where we will eat after taking a good walk, and I hope that in this way we will be able to dispel the dark thoughts that seem to hover over his soul.</t3563>
<t3564>Nothing was easier for Lorry than entering the Bank; but nothing was more difficult than leaving it.</t3564> <t3565>The quick look he intended to take lasted two hours.</t3565> <t3566>When he returned to the house in Soho and went up the stairs, without asking the servant who came to open the door for him, as he was about to enter the doctor's room, which he was heading straight for, he stood as if nailed to the floor.</t3566> <t3567>Inside the room, loud and repeated blows could be heard.</t3567>
<t3568>—Good God!—he exclaimed, stepping back a pace—What is that?</t3568>
<t3569>Miss Pross, with terror painted on her face, murmured in his ear:</t3569>
<t3570>—What a misfortune...!</t3570> <t3571>Poor us...!</t3571> <t3572>Everything is lost, everything! What do we tell the young lady? Who will tell her? Oh...!—he added, wringing his hands—She doesn't know me, Mr. Lorry, and she is making shoes!</t3572>
<t3573>Lorry tried to calm her, though in vain, and entered the doctor's room.</t3573> <t3574>He had moved the stool close to the window, just as he had it placed in the attic in Paris, and was working fervently, his head bent over the shoe.</t3574>
<t3575>—Doctor Manette!—shouted Lorry.</t3575><t3576>—My dear friend... my good Doctor Manette...!</t3576>
<t3577>The doctor raised his head, looked at the person who called him with an expression of both surprise and anger, undoubtedly displeased that they dared to address him... and continued his task.</t3577>
<t3578>He had stripped off his frock coat and waistcoat, wore his shirt unbuttoned and his chest bare, exactly as when they found him in the attic of the tavern. His face had even regained the old gaunt and somber look from the years of his misfortune, and he worked with extraordinary fervor, with impatience, like someone finishing an urgent task and not wanting to be interrupted.</t3578>
<t3579>Lorry looked at the shoe the doctor was stitching and saw that it was very old-fashioned.</t3579> <t3580>He didn't dare to take it from his hands; but he picked up another one that was at the shoemaker's feet, and asked him what it was.</t3580>
<t3581>—Walking shoe for a young lady—replied the doctor without raising his eyes.</t3581><t3582>—I should have finished it a long time ago.</t3582> <t3583>Leave me alone.</t3583>
<t3584>—But for God's sake, Dr. Manette!—exclaimed Lorry.</t3584><t3585>—Look at me!</t3585>
<t3586>The doctor obeyed with the old mechanical submission, but without interrupting his work.</t3586>
<t3587>—Don't you recognize me yet, my dear friend?</t3587> <t3588>Come to your senses, Doctor Manette!</t3588> <t3589>Your profession is not that of a shoemaker... it never has been.</t3589>
<t3590>It was a wasted effort to try to get a single word out of him.</t3590> <t3591>He would momentarily lift his head when Lorry told him to, but all the pleas and entreaties were in vain: he did not speak.</t3591> <t3592>He worked, sewed with true fervor, and the words directed at him slid over his ears, as they would slide over a cold steel wall.</t3592> <t3593>A single ray of hope shone among the shadows of despair that enveloped Lorry, and it was that sometimes, the doctor would look at him furtively without being told to.</t3593> <t3594>The ray of hope was weak, as it had no more foundation than the fact that his friend's glances seemed to indicate curiosity, perplexity of mind, something like a symptom that the doctor was trying to harmonize, reconcile certain doubts that had arisen in his soul.</t3594>
<t3595>Lorry opined that it was necessary to adopt two important resolutions, apart from others of lesser importance: the first, to prevent Lucie from learning about the misfortune, and the second, to prevent this from reaching the ears of any of the people who knew the doctor.</t3595> <t3596>In agreement with Miss Pross, he immediately took the necessary precautionary measures to achieve the second result, which consisted of stating that the doctor was indisposed, and that his state of health required a few days of rest and absolute isolation.</t3596> <t3597>To deceive his daughter, Miss Pross was to write a letter informing her that her father had had to leave for professional matters, and commenting on a letter received by mail and written by the doctor in a hurry, in which he merely stated that his absence would be brief.</t3597>
<t3598>These measures were, so to speak, of a general nature, and Lorry adopted them in case the doctor's unfortunate crisis soon disappeared.</t3598> <t3599>In case this solution did not take long, he considered it necessary, or at least very convenient, to follow a plan from which he promised great results for the future, a plan that consisted of forming a well-founded and motivated opinion about his friend's state of mind.</t3599>
<t3600>Very soon he had to convince himself that talking to him was not only perfectly useless but also harmful, since when he pressed him with questions or observations, he would upset and excite him more and more.</t3600> <t3601>Consequently, he gave up talking to him and resolved not to leave him alone for a moment, to become a silent protest against the deception into which he had fallen or was falling.</t3601> <t3602>To this end, and in his desire to carry out the noble mission he had imposed on himself while enveloping it in the utmost secrecy, for the first time in his life he took the necessary measures to remain indefinitely absent from the Bank, and took possession of an armchair placed next to the window of the doctor's room, where he spent his time reading or writing.</t3602>
<t3603>The doctor Manette ate and drank what was served to him, and worked on the first day until he ran out of light, it being noteworthy that, when he had to leave his task, it had already been a good half hour since Lorry had had to put aside the book he was reading, simply because he could no longer see the letters.</t3603> <t3604>Lorry stood up when he saw that the doctor was putting away his tools, and asked him:</t3604>
<t3605>—Do you want to go out?</t3605>
<t3606>The doctor fixed his eyes on the ground, moved them from one place to another as in times past, and finally raising them, he said:</t3606>
<t3607>—Going out?</t3607>
<t3608>—Yes...</t3608> <t3609>Come take a walk with me: why not?</t3609>
<t3610>He did not attempt to explain why not, nor did he part his lips again; but Lorry, while watching him with a penetrating gaze, bending his body, with his elbows resting on his knees and his head on the palms of his hands, believed that the unfortunate man was asking himself: "Why not?"</t3610> <t3611>The sagacity of the businessman saw an advantage in this and resolved to make the most of it.</t3611>
<t3612>During the nights, they watched over the sick person from the adjoining room, sometimes Mr. Lorry, sometimes Miss Pross, for which they had established two shifts, corresponding to the two halves into which they divided the watch duty.</t3612> <t3613>The doctor usually spent some time pacing in his room before retiring to bed; but when he lay down, he slept deeply and enjoyed a peaceful sleep.</t3613> <t3614>Come morning, as soon as he got up, he went straight to his bench and began to work.</t3614>
<t3615>On the second day of the crisis, Lorry greeted the doctor by calling him by his name, and then began to talk to him about matters that were very familiar to both of them.</t3615> <t3616>The doctor did not respond, but it was evident that he heard what was being said to him and that he was thinking about it, albeit in a confused manner.</t3616> <t3617>This encouraged Lorry, who asked Miss Pross to come in and keep him company several times during the day, in order to constantly talk about Lucia and her father, who was present at the conversations, naturally and as if nothing had happened.</t3617> <t3618>The results were not very successful, but neither were they so fruitless as to discourage Lorry from continuing the plan, as it managed, if nothing else, to dispel, even if only for brief moments, the state of indifference in which he was immersed.</t3618>
<t3619>When the night of this second day closed, Lorry repeated his question from the previous day:</t3619>
<t3620>—My dear doctor, do you want to go out?</t3620>
<t3621>And as on the previous day, the respondent answered:</t3621>
<t3622>—Go out?</t3622>
<t3623>Lorry feigned an absence upon not being able to obtain another response, returning after an hour.</t3623> <t3624>While Lorry was away, the doctor removed the stool that was next to the window and sat in a chair, from where he was contemplating the plane tree in the courtyard; but as soon as Lorry entered the room, he returned to sit on the stool.</t3624>
<t3625>Days passed, and the hopes that Lorry had conceived were gradually fading away.</t3625> <t3626>It was true that the misfortune had not left the doctor's room; it was true that it was a secret to everyone, that Lucía did not remotely suspect it and was happy and content; but the good banker could not help but see, with deep sorrow, that the shoemaker, whose hand was clumsy in the first days, was acquiring a marvelous skill, that the doctor was taking more and more pleasure in the trade, and that his hands never worked with as much fervor and dexterity as when night spread its black mantle over the ninth day after the misfortune.</t3626>
<t3627>19th.</t3627>
<t3628>AN OPINION</t3628>
<t3629>With his energies exhausted by long and anxious hours of incessant watchfulness, Mr. Lorry fell asleep at his post of honor.</t3629> <t3630>A ray as indiscreet as it was bright from the morning sun came to shake the heavy sleep that had overcome him the previous night, which was the tenth in the series of watchful nights.</t3630>
<t3631>With a nervous hand, he rubbed his eyes, stood up, and ran to the entrance of the doctor's bedroom.</t3631> <t3632>There he stopped abruptly, wondering if he was asleep or awake.</t3632> <t3633>Reasons?</t3633> <t3634>He had plenty: the stool, with the rest of the shoemaker's tools, was in a corner, and the doctor was calmly reading, lounging in an armchair by the window.</t3634> <t3635>He was wearing a morning suit, and his face, which Lorry could see perfectly, though a little pale, reflected absolute calm and placidity.</t3635>
<t3636>A few pinches administered with a firm hand convinced Mr. Lorry that he was not asleep: this point was perfectly clarified and elucidated.</t3636> <t3637>But if he was awake then, hadn't he spent the previous days sleeping?</t3637> <t3638>The shoemaker, who had caused him so many headaches, could he not have been a dreamed character, a product of a prolonged nightmare?</t3638> <t3639>Was there any other explanation for the fact that he was now seeing, with his own perfectly awake eyes, his friend, dressed as usual, calm as usual, and reading as usual?</t3639>
<t3640>And yet, if it hadn't been for his great confusion and lethargy, this last hypothesis would have fallen apart.</t3640> <t3641>If the unfortunate change caused by such a profound impression had been dreamed and not real, what was the banker from the famous Tellson doing in the quiet house in Soho?</t3641> <t3642>How had he just found himself asleep, dressed and shod, on the couch in Dr. Manette's consultation room?</t3642> <t3643>Why were these doubts assailing him at such an early hour of the morning and precisely at the entrance to the doctor's bedroom?</t3643>
<t3644>Minutes later, Miss Pross was whispering some words in his ear.</t3644> <t3645>If any trace of doubt had remained in his mind, the words that struck his ears would have dispelled it, but none remained: his head was clear and the doubts had disappeared.</t3645> <t3646>Given the new state of affairs, Lorry advised doing nothing until lunchtime, and then visiting the doctor as if nothing had happened.</t3646> <t3647>If his friend remained calm and in control, Lorry would cautiously and cleverly question him, trying to obtain something from him that could guide and direct him in the future.</t3647>
<t3648>The plan, which earned Miss Pross's approval, was executed with diligent care.</t3648> <t3649>Lorry, who had plenty of time to spruce up, appeared at lunchtime neat and impeccable.</t3649> <t3650>The doctor was called as usual, and as usual, lunch was served.</t3650>
<t3651>From the conversation, initiated and followed by Lorry with exquisite caution and tact, he inferred that the doctor believed his daughter's marriage had taken place the day before.</t3651> <t3652>Proceeding methodically in his explorations, he casually dropped a reference to the day of the week and month they were in, a reference that visibly confused the doctor, but since in all other respects he reflected an evident serenity of judgment, Lorry resolved to seek the help he desired, and he expected that help from the doctor himself.</t3652> <t3653>Consequently, after lunch was finished and the table cleared, Lorry said with signs of keen interest:</t3653>
<t3654>—My dear Manette, I wish for you to give me your opinion on a case that interests me extraordinarily, a very curious case... I mean, very curious to me, as perhaps you may find it natural and logical.</t3654>
<t3655>The doctor listened with keen attention and looked with a troubled expression at his hands, calloused from the work of the last ten days.</t3655> <t3656>He had already looked at them frequently before.</t3656>
<t3657>—The case in question affects, my dear Manette—replied Lorry—a friend of mine, whom I care for very much.</t3657> <t3658>This is why I earnestly ask you to examine it with genuine interest and advise me for the good of my friend... and above all, for the good of his daughter... my friend's daughter, my dear Manette.</t3658>
<t3659>—If I understand correctly—replied the doctor in a very low voice,—it is a mental shock...</t3659>
<t3660>—That's it!</t3660>
<t3661>—Speak to me clearly and without omitting any details—said the doctor.</t3661>
<t3662>Lorry understood that they had come to an understanding, and continued like this:</t3662>
<t3663>—My dear Manette, it is a terrible shock, very old and lasting several years, a cruel, brutal shock, of affections, of feelings, of... faculties, of the mind... that's it: of the mind.</t3663> <t3664>How long the shock that overwhelmed and crushed the unfortunate person who was its victim lasted, is something I cannot specify, for only my friend could tell us, and he was not in a condition to calculate the time.</t3664> <t3665>The one who suffered the shock managed to recover from its effects thanks to a process that he himself cannot explain... as I heard him say in public on an occasion when he gave a moving account of his misfortunes.</t3665> <t3666>I say that he has recovered from the effects of the mental upheaval so completely, that today he is a man of very clear intelligence, a man who can engage in deep intellectual pursuits, with a vigorous soul and a strong body, a man who multiplies his knowledge every day, and recounts that he already possessed a rich store of it before.</t3666> <t3667>Unfortunately... he has had... a small relapse.</t3667>
<t3668>The doctor asked eagerly:</t3668>
<t3669>—How long?</t3669>
<t3670>—It lasted nine days and nights.</t3670>
<t3671>—In what way did it manifest?—asked the doctor, looking at his hands again.</t3671><t3672>—Perhaps by returning to some old occupation related to his mental disturbance?</t3672>
<t3673>—Indeed.</t3673>
<t3674>—Another thing: Did you ever have the opportunity to see him engaged in that occupation during his original illness prior to the relapse?—asked the doctor very calmly, albeit always in a very low voice.</t3674>
<t3675>—Only once.</t3675>
<t3676>—After his relapse, did you find him the same as before in almost everything... or in everything?</t3676>
<t3677>—I think in everything.</t3677>
<t3678>—You mentioned earlier about a daughter of your friend: has the daughter heard about her father's relapse?</t3678>
<t3679>—No: the relapse has remained surrounded by the strictest secrecy, and I don't think the daughter will ever come to suspect it.</t3679> <t3680>Only two people know about it: myself, and another person of absolute trust.</t3680>
<t3681>—Delicate and generous foresight, my friend!—exclaimed the doctor, shaking Lorry's hand effusively.</t3681>
<t3682>The two interlocutors remained silent for a few moments.</t3682>
<t3683>—I am a businessman, my dear Manette—said Lorry, breaking the silence and speaking with tones of deep affection,—and, therefore, a layman in such convoluted and difficult matters.</t3683> <t3684>I lack the data to guide me, I lack the intelligence, the knowledge to lead me, I lack a person to advise me.</t3684> <t3685>In this world, there is no man in whom I can place my trust or who can dispel my doubts, except for you.</t3685> <t3686>Tell me, what was the cause of the relapse?</t3686> <t3687>Is there a danger of another occurring?</t3687> <t3688>Assuming that the danger exists, are there means to prevent it?</t3688> <t3689>What are these means?</t3689> <t3690>What can I do to benefit my friend?</t3690> <t3691>There has never been a man in the world who so eagerly wished to serve a friend as I do mine, if I knew how; but I don't know what to do if the case repeats itself.</t3691> <t3692>If your sagacity, your knowledge, your experience, can show me the right path, I believe without immodesty that I could do much: without guidance, without external help, all my good intentions will flounder in the dark sea of my ignorance.</t3692> <t3693>Please, give me some explanations, enlighten me a little and show me how to be useful to my friend.</t3693>
<t3694>Dr. Manette lowered his head and immersed himself in deep thoughts.</t3694> <t3695>Lorry waited calmly.</t3695>
<t3696>—It seems very likely to me—said the doctor after a while—that the relapse you have just described to me was foreseen by the one who was your victim.</t3696>
<t3697>—Perhaps foreseen and feared?—Lorry dared to ask.</t3697>
<t3698>—Temida, yes—exclaimed the doctor, involuntarily shuddering.</t3698><t3699>—It is impossible for you to form an approximate idea of the enormous weight with which that fear weighs upon the patient's chest... nor of the near impossibility in which he finds himself to speak a word about the matter that oppresses him.</t3699>
<t3700>—And wouldn't that oppression ease—asked Lorry—if he decided to confide in someone the secret that apparently torments him?</t3700>
<t3701>—I believe so; but it is, as I just said, almost impossible.</t3701> <t3702>It even seems to me... that it is absolutely impossible.</t3702>
<t3703>Another pause ensued, which Lorry gently ended by asking:</t3703>
<t3704>—To what do you attribute the relapse?</t3704>
<t3705>—In my opinion—replied Doctor Manette,—there has been a vigorous awakening of memories that were the determining cause of the initial illness, ideas associated with past tortures have been revived by the breath of some recent event.</t3705> <t3706>It is very likely that in the patient's mind there had been accumulating for some time the fear of this vigorous awakening of painful memories... due to certain circumstances... due to a specific event...</t3706> <t3707>In this case, the patient tried to take preventive measures... he surely would have taken them, but in vain.</t3707> <t3708>Who knows if the very efforts made to resist the blow incapacitated him to endure it!</t3708>
<t3709>—Do you think my friend remembers what he has done during the relapse?—asked Lorry, after hesitating for a few seconds.</t3709>
<t3710>The doctor cast sad glances around, shook his head, and replied in a voice lower than ever:</t3710>
<t3711>—Absolutely nothing!</t3711>
<t3712>—Let's move on now to the forecast... to the future.</t3712>
<t3713>—The future—replied the doctor energetically—fills me with great hopes.</t3713> <t3714>These hopes are based on the short duration of the relapse, thanks to Heaven.</t3714> <t3715>If we consider that the patient, after being struck down by the weight of something feared for a long time, something vaguely anticipated, something against which he vainly tried to protect himself, has recovered once the storm has passed, there are ample reasons to believe that the worst is over.</t3715>
<t3716>—Very well...! Very well!</t3716> <t3717>Your words reassure me... Thank you!—exclaimed Lorry.</t3717>
<t3718>—Thank you!—repeated the doctor, bowing his head.</t3718>
<t3719>—There are still two points on which I would like you to instruct me.</t3719> <t3720>May I continue?</t3720>
<t3721>—It is the greatest favor you can do for your friend—replied the doctor, extending his hand to him.</t3721>
<t3722>—First: my friend is studious by temperament and possesses uncommon energy.</t3722> <t3723>He ardently pursues the acquisition of new professional knowledge, conducts laborious experiments, and engages in countless activities that demand intense mental effort.</t3723> <t3724>Tell me: don't you think he works excessively?</t3724>
<t3725>—I don't think so.</t3725> <t3726>Perhaps the nature of his intelligence demands continuous mental work, whether the nature in question is innate and natural, or artificially modified, so to speak, as a consequence of sorrows and afflictions.</t3726> <t3727>The less he occupies himself with intellectual matters, the greater the danger that his thoughts will take harmful directions.</t3727> <t3728>It is likely that he himself, after observing himself carefully, has made the discovery to which I am referring.</t3728>
<t3729>—Do you have any assurance that my friend's mental work is not excessive?</t3729>
<t3730>—I have it; yes.</t3730>
<t3731>—But if he were overcome by excessive work...</t3731>
<t3732>—I highly doubt that such a thing will happen, my dear Lorry.</t3732> <t3733>When there is a violent tendency in a certain direction, it becomes indispensable to counterbalance it in some way, or otherwise, the equilibrium is broken.</t3733>
<t3734>—Excuse my insistence, my dear Manette, as it is known that we businessmen are persistent.</t3734> <t3735>Assuming that the relapse we regret was the result of intense mental pressure, is there no danger of it happening again?</t3735>
<t3736>—I don't believe it... I can't believe it—replied Dr. Manette with a tone of deep conviction.</t3736><t3737>—Only the exacerbation of a certain class of memories could provoke another relapse, only the violent vibration of the very string that caused the first one could be the cause of others.</t3737> <t3738>Now then: after what has happened, I consider it almost impossible for new exacerbations of the memories I refer to, impossible for new vibrations of the sick string.</t3738> <t3739>I believe... I almost dare to assure that the circumstances that could lead to new setbacks have disappeared forever.</t3739>
<t3740>The doctor spoke with the timidity of someone who knows how little it takes to disturb the delicate organization of intelligence, and at the same time with the confidence of one who, tempered in the bitter waters of tribulations, has acquired that strength which is capable of impassively resisting the hurricanes of life.</t3740>
<t3741>It would not be his friend who tried to combat that confidence.</t3741> <t3742>On the contrary, he showed himself more hopeful and convinced than he actually was, and proceeded to address the second point.</t3742> <t3743>This was much more difficult and thorny than the first: Lorry was very persuaded of this; but he recalled the conversation he had with Miss Pross on Sunday, took into account the painful scenes he had witnessed in the last nine days, and understood that he had a duty to face it.</t3743>
<t3744>—During his relapse, fortunately now past, he devoted himself... to the trade of... locksmith—said Lorry, with evident hesitation.</t3744><t3745>—Yes; that's it: to the trade of locksmith.</t3745> <t3746>As an example to clarify the concepts, we will say that my friend, during the time of his mental imbalance, used to work in a forge.</t3746> <t3747>We will add that, due to circumstances that need not be detailed, he has found that forge again.</t3747> <t3748>Don't you think it's a shame that he keeps it by his side?</t3748>
<t3749>The doctor ran his hand across his forehead.</t3749>
<t3750>—He has it constantly in his sight—replied Lorry, looking anxiously at his friend.</t3750><t3751>—Don't you think it would be better if he didn't see what must inevitably remind him of painful times?</t3751>
<t3752>The doctor tapped the floor with a nervous foot.</t3752>
<t3753>—Do you find the advice I ask of you so difficult?—insisted Lorry.</t3753><t3754>—It seems to me the solution is very simple, however, I believe that...</t3754>
<t3755>—You must understand—replied Doctor Manette, turning to his interlocutor—that it is extremely difficult to explain, adhering to the inflexible rules of logic, the intimate operations of the mind of the poor man to whom you refer.</t3755> <t3756>In the past, he so fervently requested to dedicate himself to that trade, that when what he longed for was granted to him, he thanked Heaven from the depths of his soul.</t3756> <t3757>It is undeniable that, upon finding a means that allowed him to substitute the perplexity of his fingers for the perplexity of his brain, and with the dexterity of his hands the operations of his tortured mind when he acquired some practice in the trade, his torments were greatly alleviated, in which case, it is natural that he shows resistance to parting from what did him so much good.</t3757> <t3758>Even today, although I believe there is not the slightest danger of new relapses, even if his friend shares this confidence of mine, the idea that there could come a day when he might need the forge, and not find it, I believe would cause him a pain only comparable to that of a father threatened with being separated from his child.</t3758>
<t3759>—We do not agree—replied Lorry.</t3759><t3760>—I know I am not an authority on the matter, for as a businessman, my intelligence extinguishes when I do not apply it to things as material as pounds sterling, shillings, and banknotes; but even so, I ask: does the preservation of the forge not tend to perpetuate the idea?</t3760> <t3761>If the forge were to disappear, my dear Manette, would not the fear disappear with it?</t3761> <t3762>In a word: is it not a concession made to fear to preserve the forge?</t3762>
<t3763>—You must also understand—replied the doctor after another moment of silence and with a trembling voice—that this is about an old colleague.</t3763>
<t3764>—An old companion whom I would distance from my side!—replied Lorry with great firmness, for it is worth noting that he was gaining it as the doctor was losing it.</t3764><t3765>—An old companion whom I would sacrifice without a shred of remorse!</t3765> <t3766>I only need your authorization.</t3766> <t3767>Keeping it is harmful; I am sure of it.</t3767> <t3768>Grant me the permission I seek, my dear Manette...</t3768> <t3769>You are good... you have a good heart... grant it to me for the sake of the peace of my poor friend's daughter...!</t3769>
<t3770>The struggle that took place in the doctor's chest between conflicting thoughts was fierce, terrible, and frightening.</t3770> <t3771>After a while, he said:</t3771>
<t3772>—In deference to his friend's daughter, I grant the authorization he asks for.</t3772> <t3773>I sanction the sacrifice of the forge; but it should not be done in front of his friend.</t3773> <t3774>Take advantage of a moment of absence and spare him the pain of witnessing the destruction of what was his sole companion in past times.</t3774>
<t3775>With true joy, Lorry accepted the solution, and the conference was concluded.</t3775> <t3776>They spent the day in the countryside, which was enough to restore the doctor.</t3776> <t3777>During the next three days, he went about his normal life, and on the fourteenth day of his daughter's absence, he went to join her and her husband.</t3777>
<t3778>As soon as night fell on the day the doctor left his house, he entered the bedroom of our good friend Lorry, armed with a butcher's knife, a saw, a chisel, and a hammer.</t3778> <t3779>Miss Pross followed him in, holding a candlestick in her hand.</t3779> <t3780>Behind closed doors, in the mystery of the night, resembling someone committing a criminal act, Mr. Lorry smashed the shoemaker's bench to pieces, while Miss Pross held the light as if witnessing the commission of a murder.</t3780> <t3781>In the kitchen, the sinful bench, previously reduced to splinters, was then incinerated, and subsequently, the tools and implements of the trade, shoes, soles, and leather, received an honorable burial in the garden adjacent to the house.</t3781> <t3782>Both Mr. Lorry and Miss Pross, while executing the feat and making the traces disappear, considered themselves, and almost appeared to be, accomplices in a horrendous crime.</t3782>
<t3783>XX.</t3783>
<t3784>A PLEA</t3784>
<t3785>The first person who showed up at Doctor Manette's house after the newlyweds returned from their honeymoon was Sydney Carton.</t3785> <t3786>His attire, his manners, his gestures, his expression, could be said to be the same as always; but over the hard exterior, despite being extraordinarily rough, there was a certain air of fidelity that did not go unnoticed by the scrutinizing gaze of Charles Darnay.</t3786>
<t3787>Carton took advantage of the first opportunity that presented itself to take Darnay to the recess of a window, where he spoke to him without their conversation reaching the ears of any of those present.</t3787>
<t3788>—I wish that we could be friends, Mr. Darnay—Carton began saying.</t3788>
<t3789>—I think we already are—replied Darnay.</t3789>
<t3790>—I appreciate you saying that, even if your words are plainly dictated by politeness.</t3790> <t3791>But I was not referring to that conventional friendship.</t3791> <t3792>When I tell you that I wish for us to be friends, I am alluding to another kind of friendship.</t3792>
<t3793>Carlos Darnay begged him to explain himself.</t3793>
<t3794>—By my life, I find it easier to understand the idea myself than to make it understandable to others!—replied Carton.</t3794><t3795>—I will try, however.</t3795> <t3796>Do you remember that memorable occasion when I was more drunk than usual?</t3796>
<t3797>—I remember the memorable occasion when you forced me to declare that I had been drinking.</t3797>
<t3798>—I haven't forgotten it either.</t3798> <t3799>The curse that weighs on those occasions leaves such lasting traces on me that it can be said I never forget them.</t3799> <t3800>I harbor the hope that a day will come, the one that puts an end to my days on earth, when I will make amends for that occasion...</t3800> <t3801>Don't be alarmed, it is not my intention to preach.</t3801>
<t3802>—I'm not alarmed!</t3802> <t3803>Your seriousness can never alarm me.</t3803>
<t3804>—Well then: regarding the drunkenness in question... one of my countless drunken episodes, I was unbearably impertinent, talking to you about whether I found you likable or unlikable: I beg you to forget it and to consider my words as unsaid.</t3804>
<t3805>—I forgot them a long time ago.</t3805>
<t3806>—Once again, your words are inspired by compliments and social conventions!</t3806> <t3807>I must say, Mr. Darnay, that I do not forget as easily as you pretend to forget.</t3807> <t3808>I have not forgotten her, and I assure you that a light and indifferent response on your part will not help me forget her.</t3808>
<t3809>—If my response has been flippant, I beg you to forgive me—replied Darnay.</t3809><t3810>—My intention was to remove all importance from what, to my considerable surprise, concerns you too much.</t3810> <t3811>I declare to you, on my word of honor, that I forgot the conversation of the night to which you refer a long time ago, and I understand that by forgetting it, I did not gain any merit.</t3811> <t3812>For what, had you not rendered me that very day a service that no moderately grateful heart can or should forget?</t3812>
<t3813>—You put me in the position of telling you—replied Carton—that the great service you speak of was simply what we might call a professional prank, one of those tricks we lawyers often resort to in order to gain popularity.</t3813> <t3814>A good proof of this is that, when I rendered it, I was completely indifferent to your fate.</t3814> <t3815>Note that I said when I rendered it; that is, I am speaking of past events.</t3815>
<t3816>—You insist on belittling my obligation, and yet, I, less finicky than you, am not offended by the lightness of your response.</t3816>
<t3817>—It is the naked truth, Mr. Darnay, the naked truth.</t3817> <t3818>But I have strayed from the object I was pursuing.</t3818> <t3819>I was speaking of my desires for us to be friends.</t3819> <t3820>As you already know me, there is no need for me to tell you that my friendship can honor no one.</t3820> <t3821>If you have any doubts, ask Stryver.</t3821>
<t3822>—I prefer to form an opinion without their assistance.</t3822>
<t3823>—Very well.</t3823> <t3824>Therefore, you already know that I am a dissolute dog, incapable of anything good, now and always.</t3824>
<t3825>—We do not agree, my friend.</t3825>
<t3826>—I assure you, and you must believe me.</t3826> <t3827>I continue.</t3827> <t3828>If you find yourself strong enough to tolerate the presence in this house of a person who is worthless, and who moreover enjoys a questionable reputation, I will ask you as a special favor to allow me to come here or leave, without adhering to hours or rules, seeing in me nothing more than a useless piece of furniture and... I would gladly add abnormal, if it weren't for the physical resemblance between the two of us... a useless piece of furniture, reserved for rare services and one that you wouldn't even notice.</t3828> <t3829>I highly doubt that I will abuse the permission, if you grant it to me.</t3829> <t3830>There is a hundred to one chance that I will not use your indulgence more than four times a year.</t3830> <t3831>It would be a satisfaction for me to know that I am abusing it.</t3831>
<t3832>—Will you do your best to take advantage?</t3832>
<t3833>—We shall see.</t3833> <t3834>Do you authorize me to take the liberty I am requesting, Darnay?</t3834>
<t3835>—Authorized, Carton.</t3835>
<t3836>They shook hands and then Carton walked away.</t3836> <t3837>A minute later, Carton was his usual extravagant self.</t3837>
<t3838>That night, in the conversations that followed dinner, in which Miss Pross, the doctor, Lorry, and the married couple took part, Sydney Carton was incidentally and generally discussed, portraying him as a living problem of indifference and recklessness.</t3838> <t3839>Darnay said a few phrases about him which, although they could not be considered harsh or offensive, reflected a certain disdain.</t3839>
<t3840>Little did he think that he had hurt the feelings of his beautiful wife.</t3840> <t3841>When later, after the gathering had ended, he found her in their room, he couldn't help but notice a certain worry in her.</t3841>
<t3842>—I find you thoughtful tonight—said Carlos, passing his arm around her waist...</t3842>
<t3843>—I am, my dear Carlos—replied Lucía, looking him straight in the eye,—I am thoughtful tonight because there is something on my mind that is bothering me.</t3843>
<t3844>—And what is it, my Lucía?</t3844>
<t3845>—Do you give me your word not to let your curiosity go beyond what I desire?</t3845>
<t3846>—And what is it that I will not promise to my love?</t3846>
<t3847>—I believe, Carlos, that poor Mr. Carton deserves more consideration and respect than you have shown him tonight.</t3847>
<t3848>—Really? And why?</t3848>
<t3849>—That is precisely what you should not ask me.</t3849> <t3850>Just think... that I know for a fact that they deserve it.</t3850>
<t3851>—If you are certain, there's nothing more to discuss.</t3851> <t3852>What do you want me to do, my love?</t3852>
<t3853>—The only thing I wish is that you always treat him with great generosity, and that you try to excuse his flaws when someone brings them to public attention in his absence.</t3853> <t3854>I also ask you to believe that in his chest beats a heart that very, very rarely reveals itself, a heart covered with very deep wounds.</t3854> <t3855>Believe me, my dear, for I assure you that I have seen it bleeding.</t3855>
<t3856>—He believes that I deeply regret having made him the object of my inconsiderations—said Darnay, still astonished by his wife's words.</t3856><t3857>—It was not my intention to treat him unfairly.</t3857>
<t3858>—Well, you didn't do him justice, my dear Carlos.</t3858> <t3859>I fear it must be impossible to make him change, that neither his character nor his special way of being are susceptible to modification; but I assure you he is a man capable of good deeds, even magnanimous actions.</t3859>
<t3860>Lucía was so beautiful, her lovely face so radiant with the purest light of faith in a man deemed irredeemable by all, that her husband, unable to find words to respond, stood there entranced, gazing at her.</t3860>
<t3861>—Please me, my love!—exclaimed Lucía, letting her little head fall on her husband's chest and raising her eyes to him.</t3861><t3862>—Reflect on how immense our happiness is, and how much he is to be pitied in his misery!</t3862>
<t3863>The plea hit the mark.</t3863>
<t3864>—I will never forget it, my little heart!</t3864> <t3865>I will remember it as long as I live!</t3865>
<t3866>He leaned over that head adorned with rich golden attire, brought his lips close to Lucía's rose-like ones, and embraced her tightly.</t3866>
<t3867>If the nocturnal wanderer who at that moment walked absorbed through the lonely streets near the little corner of Soho, had been able to hear that plea dictated by the purest compassion, if he had been given to see some very clear pearls drunk by a loving husband in some blue and clean eyes like the sky, he would have exclaimed with rapture:</t3867>
<t3868>—May God bless her beautiful soul!</t3868>
<t3869>XXI.</t3869>
<t3870>STEPS THAT RESONATE</t3870>
<t3871>The most admirable corner to gather the echoes was the one where Dr. Manette lived.</t3871> <t3872>Lucía, always engaged in the pleasant task of twisting the golden thread that connected her to her husband, her father, herself, and her former director and companion, savored a life of uninterrupted happiness in that peaceful center of tranquility, listening to the echo of the footsteps of time.</t3872>
<t3873>Sometimes, especially at the beginning, even when she considered herself completely happy, her hands would drop the golden thread she was twisting onto her knees, and the pure blue of her eyes would cloud over: it was because among the echoes that resonated far in the distance, she thought she perceived something very light, very subtle, barely perceptible yet, and which, nevertheless, caused her a certain feeling of unease.</t3873> <t3874>Then, her heart would be equally filled with soothing hopes and tormenting doubts: hopes of knowing a love she did not yet know and fears of not living long enough to savor the purest joys of that love.</t3874> <t3875>Among the echoes that on those occasions struck her ears, were the sounds of her own footsteps walking towards the grave; and thinking of the loneliness in which she would leave her husband, of the sharp pain her death would cause him, tears would come to her eyes and overflow down her cheeks.</t3875>
<t3876>Those times have passed.</t3876> <t3877>In her arms now played an angel, named Lucía, like her; and then, dominating all the echoes of the advancing steps, always stood out those of tiny little feet mixed with silver sounds emitted by a tongue that begins to babble.</t3877> <t3878>The world could be deafened by the most thunderous echoes: the young mother, sitting by the cradle, only heard the soothing music of her little daughter's half-formed words.</t3878> <t3879>The divine friend of children, to whom all mothers usually entrust the care of their children, had taken Lucía's child in his arms and turned him into an inexhaustible source of joy for her!</t3879>
<t3880>Lucía was always busy twisting the golden thread that bound the happy members of that family, always contributing to the fabric of everyone's lives with the weave of her beneficial influence, while carefully avoiding letting it dominate; in the echoes of the footsteps of the years, she heard nothing but friendly steps.</t3880> <t3881>Among them, her husband's steps stood out for being strong and prosperous; her father's were firm and always the same, and Miss Pross's were impetuous and violent, an echo that awakened a thousand echoes, similar to the harsh neighing and stamping of a horse being punished.</t3881>
<t3882>Not even on the rare occasions when echoes of joy were mixed with echoes of pain, was the latter cruel or lacerating.</t3882> <t3883>When on the pillow of a little bed fell in disarray the curls of a blonde hair, similar to Lucia's, framing the emaciated and transparent face of a child, who, smiling sweetly, said: "I am very sorry to leave my daddy and my mommy; I am also very sorry to part from my dear little sister; but they are calling me from above and I must answer the call," the tears that flooded the mother's cheeks were not tears of agony; for the fact that an angel leaves the covering that served as its dress should not tear them from her eyes.</t3883>
<t3884>To the gentle fluttering of an angel's wings were joined the echoes born on earth, resulting in a murmur that was not entirely earthly, as it was animated by a breath from the heavens.</t3884> <t3885>Also mingled with those faint sighs of the wind that kiss the flowers of the cemetery were sighs that Lucía's ear picked up, believing they were the breathing of a summer sea that sleeps upon a flat sandy beach while her little daughter, studying with comical seriousness the lessons of the morning, or engrossed in the task of dressing her dolls, chatted, mixing words from the two cities that had combined in her life.</t3885>
<t3886>Very rarely did the echoes respond to the real steps of Sydney Carton.</t3886> <t3887>Half a dozen times a year, at most, he exercised his privilege of showing up at the doctor's house uninvited and taking part in the evening gathering as he had so often done in the past.</t3887> <t3888>He never showed up drunk or even half-drunk.</t3888> <t3889>But if the echoes of his steps rarely sounded in the little corner of Soho, it was very common to hear the brief and beautiful story that they whispered about him.</t3889>
<t3890>There has never existed a man madly in love with a woman, who has seen and treated her with pure eyes and immaculate thought after she has become a wife and mother.</t3890> <t3891>As if her tender little children understood her silent pain, they showed him a singular sympathy... something like a delicate instinct of compassion towards him.</t3891> <t3892>The echoes do not speak when these sensitivities, which have their seat in the deepest recesses of the soul, vibrate, but although silent, they whisper.</t3892> <t3893>Carton was the first stranger to the house to whom little Lucía extended her chubby arms, and the child, moments before taking his flight to heaven, exclaimed: "Poor Carton!</t3893> <t3894>I wish they would give him a kiss for me!"</t3894>
<t3895>Stryver penetrated the domains of law each day with greater vigor, like a powerful ship plowing through turbulent seas, and in his wake, Carton could be seen like a barge being towed.</t3895> <t3896>The barge thus favored by the ship that took it in tow faces serious dangers, generally navigates with difficulty, and is almost always waterlogged.</t3896> <t3897>Carton also navigated the seas of life, lurching and exposed to capsizing at any moment.</t3897> <t3898>However, a deeply ingrained and firm habit, more ingrained and firmer in his heart than any of the stimulants we commonly call the perception of abandonment of misfortune, indicated the course he should follow, and Carton followed it, without ever thinking of leaving the lamentable state he found himself in, without having more aspirations to renounce his role as a jackal to a lion than a flesh-and-blood jackal has ever had to elevate itself to the category of a lion.</t3898> <t3899>Stryver was rich.</t3899> <t3900>He had married a widow who owned magnificent properties and was the mother of three children, none of whom had been endowed by the hand of nature with exceptional gifts, although they were distinguished by the thick mass of bristly spines that adorned their heads.</t3900>
<t3901>Stryver, exuding protection from every pore of his body, had presented these three little gentlemen in the peaceful house in Soho, and offered them as disciples to Lucie's husband.</t3901> <t3902>With unparalleled delicacy, said the brilliant lawyer when making the presentation:</t3902>
<t3903>—I have the pleasure of contributing these three pieces of bread to your wedding lunch, Darnay.</t3903>
<t3904>With very courteous words, Darnay declined those three pieces of bread, raising such a tempest of indignation in Stryver's noble chest, that from then on he made a special effort to ensure that in the souls of the little gentlemen in question, the idea of treating beggars like that famished teacher, whose only patrimony was pride, would be born and deeply rooted with the utmost disdain.</t3904> <t3905>He also had the good habit of enumerating and explaining to his wife the arts that Lucie Manette once used to "catch" him, and the diamond wall he opposed to her artifices, thanks to which he was an "uncatchable" fish for that fisherwoman.</t3905> <t3906>Some of his colleagues, who used to be his companions in his bacchanalian excesses, excused him by saying that he had repeated the lie in question so many times that he himself already believed it as a matter of faith... which, far from excusing an offense, aggravates it enough to justify the offended party taking the offender to a secluded and convenient place, and nicely and without annoying procedures, leaving him hanging from any tree with a noose.</t3906>
<t3907>Such were, among others, the echoes that Lucía, sometimes pensive and other times amused and even laughing out loud, heard from the peaceful corner of Soho.</t3907> <t3908>The girl turned six years old.</t3908> <t3909>The echoes of her steps along the paths of life resonated deep in her mother's heart, mingled with the equally delightful steps of the doctor, always calm and always active, and with those of her husband, always tender and always in love.</t3909> <t3910>In Lucía's ears, the gentle echoes of that home, managed by herself, sounded like divine music, a home where opulence did not reign, but abundance did.</t3910> <t3911>The echoes of what her father so often said, namely, that he found her more affectionate, if possible, married than when she was single, also sounded with exquisite sweetness.</t3911>
<t3912>Other echoes were also sounding, in the distance, yes, but not so far as to be unheard, echoes that roared menacingly over the quiet corner.</t3912> <t3913>It was around the date of Lucita's sixth birthday when its thunderous voice rose to the clouds, a voice like a terrible storm unleashed in France.</t3913>
<t3914>One night in the month of July in the year seventeen eighty-nine, Lorry appeared and took a seat by the window between Lucía and her husband.</t3914> <t3915>It was a stormy night with a scorching breath that reminded the three of that other night when they were watching the lightning from that same window.</t3915>
<t3916>—I am beginning to think—said Lorry, pushing his wig back to his nape—that I must have spent the whole night at the Bank.</t3916> <t3917>Today, such an unbridled storm of business has rained down upon us that we haven't known where to start or where to finish.</t3917> <t3918>Distrust is spreading in Paris to such an extent that confidence is coming to us like a rushing torrent.</t3918> <t3919>Our clients there can't wait to entrust us with their goods and properties.</t3919> <t3920>Nothing, nothing! It's a true mania of sending everything to England that has suddenly seized them!</t3920>
<t3921>—What in my opinion is a very bad sign—observed Darnay.</t3921>
<t3922>—A bad sign, my dear Darnay?</t3922> <t3923>Perhaps, if it obeyed justified reasons; but the world is so irrational!</t3923> <t3924>The only positive thing so far is that they are overwhelming us with work, surely without reason, without consideration that at Tellson's Bank there are many of us who are already old.</t3924>
<t3925>—However—objected Darnay,—you know perfectly well that there is a closure on the horizon, that the clouds have been condensing for a long time, threatening a storm.</t3925>
<t3926>—I know... of course I know—replied Lorry, trying to persuade himself of the need to appear a little grumpy and discontented;—so much so, that I come resolved to quarrel with anyone to make up for the fatigues of this devilish day.</t3926> <t3927>Where is Manette?</t3927>
<t3928>—Here is a piece—replied the doctor, entering the room at that moment.</t3928>
<t3929>—I'm glad you're home, as today's rush and premonitions have made me nervous for no reason or cause.</t3929> <t3930>I suppose you don't plan on going out, do you?</t3930>
<t3931>—No; if you want, we can play a game of backgammon.</t3931>
<t3932>—I prefer not to play, as tonight I am not in the mood to contend with you.</t3932> <t3933>Is the board here, Lucía?</t3933> <t3934>You have this room in darkness and, since I am not a cat, I see nothing.</t3934>
<t3935>—Here it is, waiting for you.</t3935>
<t3936>—Thank you very much, dear.</t3936> <t3937>Is the precious one in her little bed?</t3937>
<t3938>—Sleeping like a log.</t3938>
<t3939>—Very well... very well!</t3939> <t3940>The truth is that I don't know why everything shouldn't go very well here... thank God!</t3940> <t3941>But of course: they have worn me out so much today...</t3941> <t3942>And then, I'm not as young as you all are... as I was thirty years ago...!</t3942> <t3943>My little cup of tea...</t3943> <t3944>That's right, Lucía...</t3944> <t3945>Thank you!</t3945> <t3946>Now, make some room for me, I will sit in the circle, and I will try to listen to those echoes about which you have very peculiar theories.</t3946>
<t3947>—They are not theories, but whims of my imagination.</t3947>
<t3948>—Perfectly, dear; we will call them whims—replied Lorry.</t3948> <t3949>They are numerous, varied, and thunderous, aren't they? Of course!</t3949> <t3950>You just have to pay attention!</t3950>
<t3951>Hurried steps, hard steps, dangerous steps that violently penetrate someone's vital center, and once they have been stained red, they are difficult to clean, echoed in the distance, in the San Antonio neighborhood of Paris, and their resounding echoes reached the quiet corner of Soho in London.</t3951>
<t3952>That morning, San Antonio had been a field covered by a vast and stern mass of shirtless people who moved impatiently, adorned with steel sabers and bayonets on whose cold surfaces the sun's rays broke.</t3952> <t3953>The jaws of San Antonio let out tremendous screams while an immense forest of bare arms waved in the air, resembling branches of trees whipped by a terrible gale.</t3953> <t3954>There was no hand that did not wield some weapon or semblance of a weapon; there was no window that did not throw instruments of slaughter to the mobs.</t3954>
<t3955>Where they came from, who provided them, where the rain of those elements of destruction that crossed over their heads like brilliant rays began, no one could have said; but it is certain that invisible hands distributed muskets, cartridges, gunpowder, bullets, iron bars, wooden beams, knives, axes, spears, pikes.</t3955> <t3956>Those who could not procure anything else, drove their bloodied fingers into the joints of the stones or bricks and tore blocks or cobblestones from the walls.</t3956> <t3957>There was no pulse in San Antonio that did not beat erratically, no heart that did not crave blood, no living being that valued life in any way, nor any person who did not cry out to sacrifice it.</t3957>
<t3958>Just as all whirlpools of boiling waters have their central point, so that choppy sea roared around Defarge's tavern, all the human drops falling into the cauldron showed a determined tendency to approach the vortex where Defarge himself, already blackened by gunpowder and sweat, dictated orders, handed out weapons, forced this man to retreat and dragged that one towards him, disarmed one to arm another with his weapons, and worked and moved and multiplied in the center of the storm.</t3958>
<t3959>—Don't leave my side, Santiago Tercero!—roared Defarge.</t3959><t3960>—You, Santiago Primero and Santiago Segundo, lead other groups of patriots!</t3960> <t3961>Where is my wife?</t3961>
<t3962>—Here I am!—replied Madame Defarge, as composed as ever, but without knitting.</t3962>
<t3963>The sweet lady wielded an axe instead of needles, and at her waist she displayed two unique ornaments: a pistol and a long knife.</t3963>
<t3964>—Where are you, my little woman?—asked Defarge.</t3964>
<t3965>—At this moment with you: in an instant, at the head of the women—replied the innkeeper.</t3965>
<t3966>—Forward, then!—shouted Defarge with a thunderous voice.</t3966><t3967>—Patriots...!</t3967> <t3968>My friends...! To the Bastille!</t3968>
<t3969>As if this last hateful word had given shape to all the breaths of France, a terrifying roar tore through the air, that living sea swelled, its depths churned, its waves rose and engulfed the entire city.</t3969> <t3970>All the alarm bells rang, all the drums thundered, the sea bellowed and roared, and the attack began.</t3970>
<t3971>Deep moats, double drawbridges, massive stone walls, eight huge towers, cannons, muskets, fire and smoke...</t3971> <t3972>No matter!</t3972> <t3973>Amid seas of fire and clouds of thick smoke... floating through the smoke and riding on the fire, for the sea threw him against a cannon and immediately turned him into a terrible artilleryman..., Defarge, the tavern keeper, worked like an infernal soldier for two hours.</t3973>
<t3974>A wide and deep moat, a single drawbridge, robust stone walls, eight large towers, cannons, muskets, fire and smoke...</t3974> <t3975>A drawbridge falls...</t3975> <t3976>«Forward, comrades, forward! Forward, Santiago First! Forward, Santiago Second!</t3976> <t3977>Forward, Santiago Thousand, forward, Santiago Two Thousand, Santiago Five Thousand, Santiago Twenty Thousand...!</t3977> <t3978>By all the angels in Heaven... by all the demons in hell... as you wish... forward!»</t3978> <t3979>Such are the cries that come from the throat of the innkeeper, turned hours before into a terrible gunner, the innkeeper, who gives no rest to his already reddened cannon!</t3979>
<t3980>“All the women, to me!”—his wife was shouting in the meantime.</t3980><t3981>“Well, why not...! Can't we kill just like they do, once the town falls into our hands?”</t3981>
<t3982>And towards her ran herds of women, hoarse, bellowing, armed with different weapons, but all animated by the same spirit: the spirit of vengeance!</t3982>
<t3983>Cannons, muskets, fire, and smoke; but there remained a deep moat, a drawbridge, robust stone walls, and eight large towers.</t3983> <t3984>The wounded who fell left some gaps in the boiling sea.</t3984> <t3985>Weapons gleam, torches burn, carts loaded with dampened straw emit clouds of smoke, barricades spring up everywhere, fierce howls resound, repeated volleys thunder through the space, dreadful curses pierce the ears, everyone displays bravery, the living sea roars with redoubled fury... and still there remains the deep moat, and the drawbridge, and the robust stone walls, and the eight large towers, and Defarge, the innkeeper, continues at the cannon, heated to a white-hot glow as a result of four uninterrupted hours of service!</t3985>
<t3986>Within the fortress, a white flag appears... the waves roar more than ever, they swell, rise to the clouds, and drag Defarge the innkeeper, throwing him beyond the drawbridge, beyond the sturdy stone walls, among the eight great towers.</t3986>
<t3987>The force of the ocean that dragged him was so irresistible that even taking a breath, even turning his head, was as impracticable for him as if he were struggling against the undertow of the South Sea, until he found himself in the inner courtyard of the Bastille.</t3987> <t3988>There, leaning against an angle of the wall, he tried to look around.</t3988> <t3989>Next to him was Santiago Tercero, and a short distance away he saw his wife, leading the women and brandishing a knife.</t3989> <t3990>Everything was tumult, all joy, deafening and maniacal astonishment, noises, furious drum rolls.</t3990>
<t3991>—The prisoners!</t3991>
<t3992>—The records!</t3992>
<t3993>—The instruments of torture!</t3993>
<t3994>—The prisoners!</t3994>
<t3995>Of all these shouts, and of ten thousand incoherencies of the sort, the one most repeated by that raging sea was "The prisoners!".</t3995> <t3996>When the first waves penetrated, dragging the officers of the fortress ahead of them and threatening them with immediate death if they left a single hiding place unrevealed, Defarge grabbed one of them with his powerful claw, a gray-haired man who was holding a lit torch, separated him from the others, and said to him:</t3996>
<t3997>—Show me the North Tower... quickly!</t3997>
<t3998>—I will do it with great pleasure, if you want—replied the man—but there is no one in there.</t3998>
<t3999>—What does One Hundred and Five, North Tower mean?—asked Defarge—Answer... quickly!</t3999>
<t4000>—What does it mean, sir?</t4000>
<t4001>—Does it mean a captive or a dungeon to imprison captives?</t4001> <t4002>Answer! Do you want me to kill you like a dog?</t4002>
<t4003>"Kill him!" shouted Santiago Tercero.</t4003>
<t4004>—It's a cell, sir.</t4004>
<t4005>—Show it to me.</t4005>
<t4006>—This way, sir.</t4006>
<t4007>Santiago Tercero, insatiable hydropic as always, evidently disappointed to see that the dialogue was taking a turn that reduced the chances of bloodshed, clung to Defarge's arm at the same time that Defarge clung to the jailer's arm.</t4007> <t4008>During the brief dialogue transcribed above, the heads of the three men were close together, and even so, they could barely hear each other; such was the tremendous roar produced by that living ocean as it penetrated the fortress and flooded the rooms, cells, corridors, and staircases.</t4008> <t4009>The shouting outside was no less, where from time to time thunderclaps that foretold turmoil erupted, and lightning bolts crossed the heated atmosphere like immeasurable whips wielded by titans.</t4009>
<t4010>Defarge, the jailer, and Santiago Tercero, holding each other by the arms, hurried through dark corridors never visited by daylight, passed by terrifying doors of gloomy and damp dungeons, descended through cavernous stairways, and then climbed rough stone and brick steps, more akin to dry waterfalls than to stairs.</t4010> <t4011>From time to time, especially at the beginning, the flood blocked their way or swept them along; but after a while, once they entered a spiral staircase and began to ascend a tower, they were left alone.</t4011> <t4012>The walls that isolated them from the world were so thick that their ears, as if shattered by the previous furious roars, could barely perceive muffled sounds.</t4012>
<t4013>The jailer stopped in front of a very low door, took out a key, opened it, and said while bending his body to be able to enter:</t4013>
<t4014>—One Hundred Five, North Tower.</t4014>
<t4015>They found themselves in a square formed by four blackened walls.</t4015> <t4016>In one of them, there was a rusty iron ring, and in another, at the height of the vaulted ceiling, a small window defended by thick iron bars and arranged in such a way that it barely allowed a very narrow line of blue sky to be seen.</t4016> <t4017>Piles of ashes covered the floor, and its furniture consisted of a bench, a table, and a straw mattress.</t4017>
<t4018>—Pass the torch slowly along the walls so that I can see—said Defarge to the jailer.</t4018>
<t4019>The man obeyed.</t4019> <t4020>Defarge was examining the walls with a penetrating gaze.</t4020>
<t4021>—Stop...! Look, Santiago!</t4021>
<t4022>—A. M.—roared Santiago Tercero with a longing expression.</t4022>
<t4023>—Alejandro Manette—whispered Defarge in his ear, placing the tip of his index finger on the initials.</t4023><t4024>—Here he has written "poor doctor."</t4024> <t4025>No doubt about it!</t4025> <t4026>He was the one who engraved his epitaph here!</t4026> <t4027>What do you have in your hand? An iron bar? Give it to me!</t4027>
<t4028>Defarge, who still held the cannon's firebrand in his hand, exchanged it for the iron bar that Santiago Tercero handed to him and, in less time than it takes to tell, smashed the bench and the table to pieces.</t4028>
<t4029>—Raise the light!—he shouted furiously at the jailer.</t4029><t4030>—And you, Santiago, take my knife,—he added, throwing it to him—tear that mattress, and search through the straw...! Raise the light!</t4030>
<t4031>After casting a threatening look at the jailer, Defarge, while Santiago Tercero carried out his order, dug with the iron bar between the joints of the pavement slabs, stirred the ashes, and tried to move the stones of the walls.</t4031>
<t4032>—Haven't you found anything, Santiago?—he asked after a while.</t4032>
<t4033>—Nothing.</t4033>
<t4034>—We are going to make a pile with the straw and the chips... Like this!</t4034> <t4035>Light the fire, jailer!</t4035>
<t4036>The jailer immediately obeyed the order.</t4036> <t4037>The three men left the dungeon, leaving the combustible materials burning, and returned once again to the courtyard, where the disorder was as dreadful, if not more so, than before.</t4037>
<t4038>The mob was frantically, madly searching for Defarge; they wanted the tavern keeper to be the head of the guard in charge of watching over the governor who had defended the Bastille and fired upon the people.</t4038> <t4039>How else would the governor be taken to the Hôtel de Ville to be judged?</t4039> <t4040>How else would they prevent him from escaping, leaving the blood of the people unavenged, which had suddenly gained some value after so many years of being worth nothing?</t4040>
<t4041>Among the countless mobs that roared with rage and moved restlessly around the stern figure of the elderly official, whose gray overcoat with red trimmings made him more visible, there was only one calm and serene person, and that person was a woman.</t4041>
<t4042>—There is my husband—she said, extending an arm towards Defarge.</t4042>
<t4043>She stood motionless beside the governor when her husband appeared, and she continued motionless without separating from his person.</t4043> <t4044>By his side, she remained rigid and calm while Defarge and his men led him through the streets, and she did not separate when they were about to reach their destination, nor when the mobs began to strike him from behind, nor when the tips of innumerable knives tore into his flesh, nor when, riddled with wounds, he fell dead on the street stones.</t4044> <t4045>She was so close to him that upon seeing him fall, suddenly animated, she placed her foot on the neck of the dead man and with her sharp knife cut off his head.</t4045>
<t4046>Very soon the time would come when San Antonio would lower the lanterns that illuminated his brutalities and replace them with the corpses of aristocrats.</t4046> <t4047>The blood of San Antonio grew fervent as that of the iron hand of tyranny cooled... as it ran down the steps leading to the doors of the Hôtel de Ville, that of the governor, as the sole of Madame Defarge's shoe was stained red from pressing the neck of the unfortunate man whom she made the object of horrible mutilation.</t4047>
<t4048>—Lower that lantern!—roared San Antonio, after turning his bloodshot eyes around.</t4048><t4049>—Do you want a sentinel?</t4049> <t4050>Here you have one! He is a soldier of our enemies!</t4050>
<t4051>And there remained the sentinel, swaying gloomily, while the mob moved away roaring.</t4051>
<t4052>It was a sea of black and threatening waters, a sea whose waves carried destruction in each of their movements, a sea of unfathomable depth, a sea whose forces no one knew.</t4052> <t4053>A sea shielded against the sting of remorse, a sea of turbulent agitations, of cries for vengeance, of hearts hardened in the furnaces of suffering, upon whose diamond-like surface pity slid without leaving the slightest trace.</t4053>
<t4054>But in that ocean of faces, a living reflection of all furies, of all violences, two groups of faces could be observed, each formed by seven faces that stood out from the boiling human waves that carried them, shipwreck remnants like none that have ever floated on any sea.</t4054> <t4055>Above the heads of the crowds, seven faces of prisoners could be seen, unexpectedly pulled from their graves by the human storm that visited them, seven frightened, stunned, bewildered faces, as if they were being taken to execution on the shoulders of rejoicing demons; and another seven faces, carried higher, seven dead faces, whose drooping eyelids and half-closed eyes awaited the arrival of Judgment Day; impassive faces whose life did not seem extinguished, but suspended, faces that seemed as if they were about to raise their eyelids again and open their blood-covered lips to say: "You murdered me!"</t4055>
<t4056>Seven prisoners freed, seven bloody heads carried as horrible trophies on the spikes of pikes, the keys of the cursed fortress of the eight strong towers, some letters, a few memorials of ancient prisoners who had died of sorrow many years before... and something else of the sort, paraded through the streets of Paris amidst a very numerous escort, one day in mid-July of the year seventeen eighty-nine.</t4056> <t4057>May Heaven keep the echo of the steps of the aforementioned escort away from the life of Lucie Darnay!</t4057> <t4058>For they are echoes of hurried steps, of hard steps, of dangerous steps that violently penetrate the vital core of someone, echoes produced by feet that years before were stained red as a result of a barrel breaking near the door of Defarge's tavern, and when those feet are stained red, they are hardly ever cleaned.</t4058>
<t4059>XXII.</t4059>
<t4060>THE TIDE RISES</t4060>
<t4061>For only a week had the terrible San Antonio sweetened the harshness of the hard and bitter bread he put in his mouth, for only a week had he had the satisfaction of doing whatever he pleased and of alternating his outbursts with fraternal hugs and cordial congratulations.</t4061> <t4062>Madame Defarge presided over her patrons from her usual spot.</t4062> <t4063>She no longer wore a rose in her hair, for the great brotherhood of spies had become so circumspect in the brief span of seven days that not even by a miracle could one find someone willing to entrust themselves to the tender care of the Saint.</t4063> <t4064>The street lamps of those streets exerted a wondrous influence over them.</t4064>
<t4065>With arms crossed, Mrs. Defarge watched the street from behind the counter, while also keeping an eye on her establishment.</t4065> <t4066>Neither in the street nor in the establishment were there any shortages of well-nourished groups of loafers, scrawny and ragged, but with faces that reflected the power they had enthroned over their miseries.</t4066> <t4067>Even the dirtiest and most tattered cap, scowling from atop the head it half-covered, seemed to say: "I know how hard you made life for me: but do you know how easy it has become for me to take away the comfortable and happy life you lead?"</t4067> <t4068>All the bare arms that had previously lacked work now had it in abundance and perpetuity: to wound, to kill.</t4068> <t4069>The fingers of the women, previously occupied with knitting, had taken to other tasks since they realized they knew how to tear.</t4069> <t4070>Saint Anthony had undergone a radical transformation: the image, after hundreds of years of tranquility, was now in motion and delivering terrifying blows.</t4070>
<t4071>All this was observed by Madame Defarge from behind the counter of her establishment with the complacency of the leader of the women of Saint Antoine.</t4071> <t4072>One of her sisters was knitting beside her.</t4072> <t4073>She was a short and somewhat plump woman, married to a shopkeeper and mother of two children to boot, who had earned the glorious nickname of "The Vengeance."</t4073>
<t4074>—Attention!—exclaimed La Venganza—Who goes there?</t4074>
<t4075>As if they had set fire to a trail of gunpowder that extended from the borders of San Antonio's domains to Defarge's tavern, thus rumors reached the shop, born far away, and spread with dizzying speed in all directions.</t4075>
<t4076>—It's Defarge!—said the tavern keeper.</t4076><t4077>—Silence, patriots!</t4077>
<t4078>Defarge entered, panting, out of breath; he tore the red cap from his head that adorned it, and cast quick glances around him.</t4078>
<t4079>—Attention everyone!—shouted the innkeeper.</t4079><t4080>—Listen to him!</t4080>
<t4081>Defarge had remained on the threshold, contemplating the sea of open eyes and even more open mouths that filled the street.</t4081> <t4082>The people inside the tavern stood up.</t4082>
<t4083>—Speak, Defarge!—replied the tavern keeper.</t4083><t4084>—What's happening?</t4084>
<t4085>—News from the other world!</t4085>
<t4086>—Really?—asked his wife, putting a strong sarcastic tone in her words.</t4086><t4087>—From the other world?</t4087>
<t4088>—Do you all remember that individual named Foulon, who told the starving people to eat grass, and to try to die quickly and go to hell?</t4088>
<t4089>—Yes...!—shouted the mobs in unison.</t4089>
<t4090>—My news refers to him.</t4090> <t4091>We have him among us.</t4091>
<t4092>—Among us!—they all roared.</t4092><t4093>—Dead?</t4093>
<t4094>—No; he is alive.</t4094> <t4095>Such was the terror he had of us... and rightly so, that he pretended to be dead and ordered a grand funeral for himself.</t4095> <t4096>But he has been found alive, hiding in the countryside, and they have brought him here.</t4096> <t4097>I just saw him this moment while they were taking him prisoner to the Hôtel de Ville.</t4097> <t4098>I said that he feared us with reason... Tell me...! Did he fear us with reason?</t4098>
<t4099>The blood of that ancient sinner would have frozen if the fierce cry that came from the monster's jaws had reached his ears.</t4099>
<t4100>A few moments of deep silence followed.</t4100> <t4101>Defarge and his wife stared at each other with a terrifying intensity; La Vengeance remained motionless, and a drum rolled in the distance while behind the counter there was a sound like moving feet.</t4101>
<t4102>—Patriots!—shouted Defarge with a resolute voice.</t4102><t4103>—Are we ready?</t4103>
<t4104>Immediately, the long knife appeared at the waist of the innkeeper, drums rolled through the streets, as if they and those who struck their patches had sprung up by magical arts, and La Venganza, letting out ferocious screams, with her hair loose and waving her arms above her head, resembling not one, but all forty Furies together, ran from house to house inciting the women.</t4104>
<t4105>Terrible was the expression of the men who, thirsty for blood, stuck their heads out of the windows; even more terrible was that of those who, wielding the most deadly weapons they could get their hands on, came out of the doors of the houses and spread furiously through the streets; but the expression of the women was enough to freeze the blood of the most fearless man.</t4105> <t4106>Abandoning the domestic tasks imposed by their misery, leaving their old and their children, naked and starving, lying on the hard ground, they went out into the street, their hair loose, trampling over each other, howling like maddened beasts and acting as such.</t4106>
<t4107>—Die, Foulon, who stole my sister!</t4107>
<t4108>—Death to the villain Foulon, who robbed my mother!</t4108>
<t4109>—Die, scoundrel Foulon, who stole my daughter from me!</t4109>
<t4110>Others, in large groups, penetrated among those who had previously shouted and, striking their chests fiercely and tearing at their hair, they vociferated:</t4110>
<t4111>—Foulon alive!</t4111> <t4112>He who told the starving people to eat grass must not live!</t4112> <t4113>The demon who told me to give grass to my mother when bread was lacking cannot live!</t4113> <t4114>The monster who told me to give grass to suck on, when my breasts, dried up from hunger, could not provide the milk needed to live, will not live!</t4114>
<t4115>—Holy Virgin!—others exclaimed.</t4115><t4116>—Listen to me, my son, from the other world to which the inhuman Foulon took you!</t4116> <t4117>Listen to me, my father, who died of hunger because of him!</t4117> <t4118>By your bones, by your soul, I swear to avenge you on the person of Foulon!</t4118>
<t4119>—Husbands... give us the blood of Foulon!</t4119> <t4120>Young fathers, give us the head of Foulon!</t4120> <t4121>Brothers, give us the heart of Foulon!</t4121> <t4122>Young patriots, give us the body and soul of Foulon, tear apart the miserable corpse of Foulon, bury it, so that it may fertilize the land and grass may grow over his remains, the grass he advised us to eat!</t4122>
<t4123>These and other no less terrifying screams drove many women to frenzy, who, after running with insane fury, howling like beasts, and hitting and scratching their own friends, rolled on the ground with their eyes out of their sockets and their mouths foaming.</t4123> <t4124>Thanks to their relatives or friends lifting them up, they did not die crushed under the thousands of beastly feet.</t4124>
<t4125>Not a moment was lost.</t4125> <t4126>Foulon was at the Hôtel de Ville where he might be set free... Would San Antonio tolerate such mockery?</t4126> <t4127>Never, if he had not lost the notion of his dignity, the memory of his sufferings, of his insults, of his injustices!</t4127> <t4128>A flood of armed men and disheveled women soon overflowed the district's boundaries, dragging with it every human creature raised on the dry breasts of San Antonio, with the exception of a few decrepit old men and some children unable to walk.</t4128>
<t4129>The mobs have already entered the room where they are taking the old man's statement, who may have been ruthless, but at that moment was deserving of compassion.</t4129> <t4130>In a prominent place, in the front row, a short distance from the prisoner, are the Defarges, husband and wife, La Vengeance, and Jacques Three.</t4130>
<t4131>—Look at him!—shouts the innkeeper, pointing at him with the tip of the knife.</t4131><t4132>—There you have the old villain tied up with ropes!</t4132> <t4133>It wouldn't be a bad idea to tie a bundle of grass to his back!</t4133> <t4134>Ha, ha, ha, ha!</t4134> <t4135>It's the best we can do... force him to eat grass!</t4135>
<t4136>The innkeeper placed her knife under her arm and applauded herself.</t4136>
<t4137>As the people who were positioned behind Madame Defarge hurried to explain to those following them the cause of her satisfaction, and the explanation spread from ear to ear like wildfire, soon deafening applause resounded in the hall, in the street, and in the nearby squares.</t4137> <t4138>In the same way, all the expressions of impatience uttered by Madame Defarge over two or three hours were transmitted with astonishing speed over great distances.</t4138> <t4139>It is not surprising: men endowed with exceptional agility climbed the facade of the building, taking advantage of the architectural adornments that covered it, until they perched on the windowsills, from where they could perfectly see and hear Madame Defarge and acted as a telegraph between her and the crowd roaring outside.</t4139>
<t4140>The sun rose so high that it finally cast a cheerful ray of confidence or protection over the old man's head.</t4140> <t4141>Clouds of dust rose in the distance; the sound of furious galloping horses was carried by the air in its waves; but Saint Anthony was awake, Saint Anthony was vigilant, and his keen eyes saw the clouds of dust, and his sensitive ears heard the thunder of the horses' hooves.</t4141>
<t4142>Defarge leaped over the balustrade and the table, and embraced the unfortunate old man in a deadly grip.</t4142> <t4143>The tavern keeper followed her husband like a faithful wife, and grabbed one of the ropes that bound the prisoner.</t4143> <t4144>Before La Vengeance and Santiago Third had time to join them, before the men perched in the windows could jump into the room, the entire city seemed to shout with hundreds of thousands of mouths:</t4144>
<t4145>—It's ours...! To the lantern!</t4145>
<t4146>Knocked to the ground and lifted back up, forced to descend dragging that fatal ladder, sometimes headfirst, other times on his knees, now face down and now on his back, brutally beaten and wounded, suffocated by the bundles of grass and straw that hundreds of hands violently shoved into his mouth, shattered, crushed, losing blood in torrents, the wretched man did not cease for an instant to beg for mercy.</t4146> <t4147>His agonies increased when the beasts closest to him stepped aside so that no one would be deprived of the pleasure of watching him, and they reached their ultimate limit when he saw that they tied him by the feet to a log and carried him to the nearby corner, where there was a lantern.</t4147> <t4148>There, Madame Defarge released him, like a cat playing with a mouse, and looked at him with terrifying calmness without uttering a word, while the men completed their preparations, unaffected by the pleas the unfortunate man directed at her.</t4148> <t4149>They hoisted him up, and the rope broke...</t4149> <t4150>The same thing happened twice, until finally, a rope, more compassionate than the men, held and put an end to his sufferings.</t4150> <t4151>Moments later, Saint Anthony danced around a head, impaled on a pike, from whose mouth bundles of grass and straw protruded.</t4151>
<t4152>The day did not end there.</t4152> <t4153>San Antonio shouted so much, danced so much, that his burning blood ignited again at dusk, upon learning that a son-in-law of the old man who had fallen under his wrath, another of the enemies and offenders of the people, was arriving in Paris with an escort of five hundred mounted men.</t4153> <t4154>San Antonio wrote the account of their crimes on sheets of paper stained with blood, attacked the escort... and minutes later paraded through the streets in a joyful procession carrying the trophies of the day impaled on pikes: two heads and a heart!</t4154>
<t4155>Until night fell, those men and women did not think about the elderly or the children they had left in their homes, abandoned and without bread.</t4155> <t4156>The miserable bakeries were besieged by endless lines of people waiting for their turn to buy a miserable crust of bad bread, and while they waited with empty stomachs, they celebrated their triumphs by hugging each other and chatting incessantly.</t4156> <t4157>Gradually, the lines shortened and finally disappeared: then some dim lights shone inside the houses, and some bonfires were lit in the streets where the poorest cooked together the slop that they later ate in their respective homes.</t4157>
<t4158>Those dinners were poor and insufficient, pure of meat and free of sauces and seasoning, and yet, the eyes of those who ate such unappetizing dishes sparkled with joy.</t4158> <t4159>Fathers and mothers who had taken an active part in the day played happily with their emaciated children, and the lovers, despite the overcast sky, loved and hoped.</t4159>
<t4160>The day was very near when the patrons of Defarge's tavern left, and as he was closing the door, he said to his wife:</t4160>
<t4161>—At last, it arrived, dear.</t4161>
<t4162>—Yes... almost—replied the lady.</t4162>
<t4163>Saint Anthony slept, Defarge slept, even La Vengeance slept next to her famished grocer, and the drums also slept.</t4163> <t4164>They were the only voice of Saint Anthony that did not change, that always sounded the same.</t4164> <t4165>If La Vengeance, who was in charge of them, had awakened them, it is quite certain that they would have delivered the same speech they gave when the Bastille fell, the same one they gave when Foulon was beheaded.</t4165>
<t4166>XXIII.</t4166>
<t4167>THE FIRE IS GAINING INTENSITY</t4167>
<t4168>Important changes have occurred in the village from which the road worker would leave every day to wrest from the stones that covered the roads the crust of bread that kept his ignorant soul tied to his emaciated body.</t4168> <t4169>The prison of the cut was no longer as formidable as before.</t4169> <t4170>Soldiers guarded it, but they were few in number; officers guarded the soldiers, but they did not know what the soldiers would do, for if they knew anything, it was... that they would be very careful not to do what they were ordered.</t4170>
<t4171>The entire territory that could be seen was a desolate steppe.</t4171> <t4172>The grass that covered the roads and fields, the plants that germinated there, were as poor and stunted as the people themselves.</t4172> <t4173>Bent plants, toppled, crushed... men with hunched backs, disheartened men, oppressed... misery in the homes, misery in the garden fences, misery in the domestic animals, misery in the men, in the women, in the children, misery in the ground on which they all set their feet.</t4173>
<t4174>The gentleman, almost always a most dignified knight considered as an individual, was a national blessing, gave tone to things, and constituted by himself an eloquent example of a brilliant and lavish life; but the gentleman, considered as an institution, as a class, had created that deplorable state of affairs.</t4174> <t4175>Strange phenomenon that the world, brought out of nothing for the gentleman's pleasure and enjoyment, was so soon squeezed dry and without a drop of juice!</t4175> <t4176>And yet, it was so.</t4176> <t4177>The gentleman, finding no longer a drop of blood to suck, seeing nothing to bite into, began to turn his back on a phenomenon as low as it was inexplicable.</t4177>
<t4178>But the important changes that occurred in the village and in many other similar villages did not precisely lie in that.</t4178> <t4179>Dozens of years ago, the lord squeezed and wrung the people without it occurring to him to honor them with his gracious presence more than very few times, and even then, it was to indulge in the pleasures of the hunt... whether it was of men or animals.</t4179> <t4180>No.</t4180> <t4181>The change consisted more in the appearance of lowly faces than in the disappearance of the faces of the upper class.</t4181> <t4182>At the time we refer to, when the solitary road worker labored turning the soil, without thinking that it was dust and to dust it would return, for his thoughts almost always revolved around how little he would find to eat for dinner at home, and how much he would eat if he had it, in those times, if he lifted his eyes from the ground and looked along the road, it was not impossible that they would encounter men of rough appearance, very rare before in those places and very frequent now.</t4182> <t4183>As those men approached the road worker, he saw that they were generally individuals with coarse bristles and an almost barbaric appearance, tall, wearing clogs, with a fierce look, covered in mud and dust, like someone who has walked many roads.</t4183>
<t4184>One of these specimens appeared suddenly to the road worker, one day in the month of July around noon, while he was sitting sheltered by a wall, to protect himself from the hail that the clouds were sending in abundance.</t4184>
<t4185>The stranger looked at him, then let his eyes wander over the village that slept in the hollow, over the mill and the prison that stood on the cliff, and when he had identified all those objects, he asked, in a dialect that was barely intelligible:</t4185>
<t4186>—How are you, Santiago?</t4186>
<t4187>—Very well, Santiago.</t4187>
<t4188>—High five!</t4188>
<t4189>The two interlocutors exchanged a handshake.</t4189>
<t4190>—Is there no food?</t4190>
<t4191>—Just dinner—replied the truck driver with a hungry look.</t4191>
<t4192>—It's the fashion—grumbled the stranger.</t4192><t4193>—I can't find anyone who eats.</t4193> <t4194>Then he took out a blackened pipe, filled it, and lit it, and then dropped something he had between his thumb and index finger onto it.</t4194> <t4195>A flame and a small cloud of smoke emerged from the pipe.</t4195>
<t4196>—High five!—exclaimed the road worker, after attentively observing the aforementioned operations.</t4196>
<t4197>The interlocutors exchanged the second handshake.</t4197>
<t4198>—Tonight?—asked the truck driver.</t4198>
<t4199>—Tonight—replied the stranger, bringing the pipe to his mouth.</t4199>
<t4200>—Where?</t4200>
<t4201>—Here.</t4201>
<t4202>Both remained seated on the pile of stones, looking at each other, until the hail stopped and the sky cleared.</t4202>
<t4203>—Instruct me—said the traveler then, addressing the crest of the hill.</t4203>
<t4204>—Look—replied the traveler, with his arm extended,—go down to the hollow, enter through the street, you will pass the fountain...</t4204>
<t4205>—To hell with the street and the fountain!—exclaimed the stranger impatiently.</t4205><t4206>—I neither want to enter any street nor pass by any fountains.</t4206>
<t4207>—About two leagues beyond the summit of the hill that rises above the village.</t4207>
<t4208>—Current.</t4208> <t4209>When do you leave work?</t4209>
<t4210>—At sunset.</t4210>
<t4211>—Will you wake me up before you leave?</t4211> <t4212>It's been two nights and days that I've been traveling without rest or sleep.</t4212> <t4213>I'll finish smoking this pipe and sleep like a blessed one... Will you wake me up?</t4213>
<t4214>—With great pleasure.</t4214>
<t4215>The wanderer smoked his pipe, put it away in his chest, took off his clogs, and lay down on his back on the pile of stones.</t4215> <t4216>Seconds later, he was sleeping deeply.</t4216>
<t4217>A strange fascination was exerted by the traveler's figure lying on the pile of stones over the road worker, whose cap was no longer blue, as before, but red.</t4217> <t4218>Engaged in his rough task, he so frequently turned his eyes towards the sleeper that it can be said he handled his tools in a mechanical manner and with scant results.</t4218> <t4219>The bronzed face, the tousled black hair and thick beard of the same color, the red cap made of coarse wool, the rough cloth suit, the robust constitution slightly diminished by deprivations, and the rigid and violent compression of the traveler's lips, filled the road worker with fear.</t4219> <t4220>The unknown man must have traveled great distances, judging by his blistered feet and his chafed and bleeding ankles.</t4220> <t4221>The road worker tried to see if the sleeper was carrying weapons or not, but in vain, as the sleeper's arms, crossed over his chest, prevented it.</t4221> <t4222>Fortresses, walled enclosures, deep ditches, and drawbridges must have been minor obstacles for men like him; and when the road worker, taking his eyes off him, raised them and looked around, he believed he saw with his imagination men like him who, blind to obstacles, ran determinedly from the periphery towards the center of France.</t4222>
<t4223>The stranger continued sleeping, indifferent to the hailstorms that fell from time to time, indifferent to the kisses of the burning sun, and indifferent to the shadows.</t4223> <t4224>He did not wake up, he did not move until, with the setting of the day's star, the road worker woke him up, after gathering all his tools to begin the return to the village.</t4224>
<t4225>—Very well—said the stranger, sitting up.</t4225><t4226>—You say two leagues beyond the crest of the hill that overlooks the village?</t4226>
<t4227>—More or less.</t4227>
<t4228>—More or less...</t4228> <t4229>Alright.</t4229>
<t4230>The truck driver returned home, following the cloud of dust raised by his feet and pushed by the wind blowing at his back, and soon found himself by the fountain among tightly packed herds of skinny cows brought there to drink.</t4230> <t4231>The village did not retire to their poor beds, as usual, after gulping down their meager dinners, but instead took to the streets and remained there.</t4231> <t4232>Everyone spoke in very low voices, as if whispering in each other's ears had become fashionable, and everyone had their eyes fixed on the horizon, the most curious thing being that they all looked in the same direction.</t4232> <t4233>Mr. Gabelle, the chief authority of the village, began to feel strange unease. After climbing to the roof of his house and looking from there towards the point on the horizon that seemed to exert such fascination over the usually calm villagers, and after examining, sheltered behind the chimney, the somber faces of those gathered around the fountain, he sent word to the sacristan, who was in charge of the church keys, that perhaps that night there might be a need to ring the alarm bell.</t4233>
<t4234>The night closed in, black, gloomy, sinister.</t4234> <t4235>The tops of the giant trees surrounding the castle swayed in the wind's breath and resembled prodigious maces wielded by invisible titans against the massive stone structure.</t4235> <t4236>The water fell in torrents.</t4236> <t4237>The two monumental staircases on the terrace seemed like overflowing torrents whose turbulent flow crashed thunderously against the main door, akin to a swift messenger trying to wake those sleeping inside.</t4237> <t4238>The gale penetrated through the spacious galleries, whipping the spears, swords, knives, and pikes that decorated the walls, and, ascending the stairs, stirred the curtains of the bed where the last Marquis had rested.</t4238> <t4239>Confused figures, coming from the East and the West, the North and the South, trampled the overgrown grass of the forest and cautiously advanced towards the castle courtyard, where they gathered.</t4239> <t4240>Four lights emerged, moving in opposite directions, and everything returned to darkness seconds later.</t4240>
<t4241>The darkness lasted briefly.</t4241> <t4242>The castle began to shine with its own light, as if supernatural forces had suddenly transformed it into a luminous castle.</t4242> <t4243>Behind the sturdy facade, glowing streams ran, soon manifesting through every transparent spot it offered, highlighting the position and shape of the balustrades, arches, and windows.</t4243> <t4244>The flames rose... rose higher, and the immense bonfire grew in size and brilliance by the moment.</t4244> <t4245>Soon, jets of fire burst from twenty large windows at once, awakening the stone sentinels, whose faces lost their impassivity, replaced by astonishment.</t4245>
<t4246>In the house adjacent to the castle, they quickly saddle a horse, which gallops off, cutting through the darkness of the night and soon arrives, covered in foam, at the village square, stopping in front of the door of Mr. Gabelle's house.</t4246>
<t4247>—Help, Gabelle... help, everyone!—cries the frightened rider.</t4247>
<t4248>The alarm bell rings out, but aside from this aid, if it can be called that, the rider receives none.</t4248> <t4249>With arms crossed by the fountain, watching the immense blaze projected against the sky, stands the road worker among a group of about two hundred and fifty of his personal friends.</t4249>
<t4250>—They rise to about forty feet in height—is the only comment they make, but no one moves.</t4250>
<t4251>The messenger from the castle digs his spurs into the flanks of the foam-covered horse and disappears into the shadows.</t4251> <t4252>At full gallop, and with the grave danger of breaking his head, he climbs the steep slope that leads to the fortress-prison of the cliff.</t4252> <t4253>A group of officers, standing by the door, watches the dreadful fire; a short distance from them, there is another, larger group of soldiers.</t4253>
<t4254>—Help, noble officers!</t4254> <t4255>The castle is on fire!</t4255> <t4256>Inside its walls, there are objects of great value that could be saved from the fury of the flames...</t4256> <t4257>There is still time...! Help... help!</t4257>
<t4258>The officers look at the soldiers, and they keep their eyes fixed on the fire.</t4258> <t4259>They do not give any orders; on the contrary, shrugging their shoulders, they exclaim:</t4259>
<t4260>—Let it burn!</t4260>
<t4261>The rider descends again, crosses the village street, and sees with astonishment that all the houses are illuminated.</t4261> <t4262>How did the miracle happen?</t4262> <t4263>In the simplest way.</t4263> <t4264>The road worker and his two hundred and fifty personal friends had the whim to light up their houses.</t4264> <t4265>Since they lack torches, they demand them quite peremptorily from Mr. Gabelle.</t4265> <t4266>The official shows hesitations, resistances, and in his view, the road worker, who was once so submissive to his authority, hints to his two hundred and fifty personal friends that the carriages, conveniently broken into pieces, provide excellent torches, and that the post horses are begging to be roasted.</t4266>
<t4267>The castle is left abandoned to the wrath of the destructive element.</t4267> <t4268>Blazing hurricanes, undoubtedly born in infernal regions, contribute to the work, fanning the roaring flames and shaking the sturdy building.</t4268> <t4269>The stone faces of the eternal sentinels twist among cascades of sparks and burning seas.</t4269> <t4270>As enormous masses of stone mixed with gigantic beams fall with a crash, the stone face that has two nicks on the nose acquires a decidedly sinister expression.</t4270> <t4271>Everyone would have taken it for the face of the cruel Marquis who, tied to the pyre, struggles desperately against the fire.</t4271>
<t4272>The castle was burning.</t4272> <t4273>The nearest trees, reached by the fire, twisted, bent, and wrinkled; others farther away, ignited by the four terrible figures, sent seas of black smoke to the burning mass.</t4273> <t4274>In the bowels of the marble fountain, lead and molten iron boiled; the water had stopped flowing, and the spires of the towers, as if they were made of ice, melted under the heat.</t4274> <t4275>Bands of frightened birds fluttered around in confusion and ended up falling into the midst of the furnace, and meanwhile, the four figures moved away, guided by the glow they had created, towards their new destination.</t4275> <t4276>The village took hold of the alarm bell, and abolishing at once the significance of its tolls, forced it to celebrate their joy.</t4276>
<t4277>And it didn't stop there: the village, whose mind seemed to have been suddenly cleared by hunger, flames, and the voices of the alarm bell, which now rang with joy, suspecting that Mr. Gabelle might have something to do with the collection of rents and taxes, although truth be told, the good Gabelle had not collected any taxes in the previous days, and only some overdue rents, wished to have an interview with him, and to that end, surrounded his house and invited him to come out to the street, where they could confer personally.</t4277> <t4278>Mr. Gabelle responded by solidly barricading his door and retreating to the most hidden room, in order to hold the conference with himself.</t4278> <t4279>The result of this one-person conference was that the good Gabelle climbed back up to the roof of his house and hid behind the chimneys, resolved, in case the villagers broke down the front door, to throw himself headfirst from the roof to the street in order to crush under the weight of his body one or two of those who so eagerly wished to confer with him.</t4279> <t4280>Do not be surprised by his decision: Gabelle was a southerner with a vengeful character.</t4280>
<t4281>It is more than likely that the night seemed eternal to Mr. Gabelle, for it is indeed not very pleasant to spend it on the roof, watching from afar the sinister glow of a burning castle, listening to the blows that an enraged crowd delivers against the door of his house, and above all, seeing a lantern hanging from its post, which the crowd looked at from time to time with the desire to replace it with another object, which very well could be his body.</t4281> <t4282>It is indeed sad to spend an entire summer night on the eaves of a roof, watching at your feet an ocean of tumultuous black waves, and resolved to throw yourself headfirst into its center; but at last a cheerful dawn appeared, the lights went out, the crowd dispersed, and Mr. Gabelle was able to come out of the ordeal alive.</t4282>
<t4283>Within a radius of one hundred miles, and in the light of other fires, there were that night, and other nights, many officials less fortunate than Mr. Gabelle, whom the sun of the new day found hanging in the same streets, peaceful in better times, where they were born and grew up.</t4283> <t4284>It is true that there were also other villagers, other citizens who, less fortunate than the road worker and his two hundred and fifty particular friends, fell to the blows of the officials and soldiers.</t4284> <t4285>But the fierce bearers of the fire continued their race towards the East and the West, to the North and the South, marking their passage with trails of flames, and there was no official, however versed in mathematics, capable of calculating the height of the gallows necessary to contain or divert the course of the plunging torrent.</t4285>
<t4286>XXIV.</t4286>
<t4287>ATTRACTED BY THE MAGNETIC MOUNTAIN</t4287>
<t4288>Three years the storms lasted, three years during which the oceans roared incessantly and flames raged everywhere, three years of continuous terrors for those who watched from the shore the ever-growing fury of the seas.</t4288> <t4289>Three more birthdays did little Lucia see, in whose peaceful existence her loving mother never ceased to weave new threads of gold.</t4289>
<t4290>More than a day and more than a night, the residents of the quiet corner of Soho listened with bitter pain to the sound of footsteps that hurt their ears, for they knew they were the footsteps of enraged people, running tumultuously under the shadow of red banners, they knew their homeland had been declared in danger, that its inhabitants had transformed from human beings into ferocious beasts.</t4290>
<t4291>The gentleman, as a class, could not understand the phenomenon of not being appreciated, of not being needed in France, of not being loved, of being hated to the point of facing imminent danger of being expelled from French soil and from the world of the living at the same time.</t4291> <t4292>Similar to the rustic man in the fable who, after having managed to summon the devil through persistent invocations, was so terrified upon seeing him that he couldn't even muster the voice to ask a question of the enemy, so too did the gentleman, after having the audacity to pray the Lord's Prayer backwards for several years and employing the most potent spells and charms to awaken the demon, hasten to show his noble and high-born heels as soon as he caught a glimpse of him.</t4292>
<t4293>The brilliant sky of the court had been eclipsed, convinced that it would be the inevitable target of the relentless rain of bullets from the people.</t4293> <t4294>It was never a favorite of theirs, for according to malicious tongues, Satan had inoculated him with his pride and Sardanapalus with his luxury and indulgence.</t4294> <t4295>The entire court, from its central and exclusive point to all the rotten points of its circumference of intrigues, corruption, and dissimulation, had abandoned that unhealthy atmosphere.</t4295> <t4296>The royalty had also disappeared: besieged in its palace, it was "suspended" when the furious waves reached it.</t4296>
<t4297>In the month of August in the year seventeen ninety-two, the caste of the lords was scattered around the world.</t4297>
<t4298>As is natural, the headquarters, the meeting center of the gentry in London was the Tellson Bank.</t4298> <t4299>They say that spirits haunt the places where their bodies are buried, and in accordance with this law, the penniless gentleman haunted the place where in better times his money had been deposited.</t4299> <t4300>Moreover, the Tellson Bank was the center where news from France arrived most quickly: it extended its generosity to the point of making advances to those who had been its clients in prosperous times; it kept immense sums deposited by nobles who, more foresighted than the majority, saw the storm brewing and preempted thefts and confiscations, and finally, all the people arriving from France began by showing up at the Tellson Bank, where they recounted the latest events.</t4300> <t4301>For all these various reasons, the Tellson Bank at that time was a kind of Stock Exchange Palace as far as French matters or people were concerned, a circumstance so well known to the public, and which gave rise to so many questions and commissions, that the latest news was often posted on placards hung from the building's windows, so that all who passed in front of the Temple Bar could read them.</t4301>
<t4302>A misty and sweltering afternoon, Lorry and Charles Darnay, seated across from each other at the former's desk, were conversing in low voices.</t4302> <t4303>There would be about half an hour left before closing the establishment.</t4303>
<t4304>—I know that you are the youngest man who has ever existed in the world;—said Charles Darnay with signs of hesitation,—but even so, forgive me for saying...</t4304>
<t4305>—I understand: that I am very old, right?—interrupted Lorry.</t4305>
<t4306>—Uncertain weather, long journey, uncertain means, and a country in a state of anarchy, not to mention a city that cannot even offer you guarantees.</t4306>
<t4307>—My dear Carlos—replied Lorry confidently,—the reasons you have just pointed out, far from discouraging me, far from conspiring against my plan to make the trip, conspire for me to do it.</t4307> <t4308>No one will have the bad taste to mess with an old man of almost eighty years, when they can do so with so many other young, robust people, who are more worthy of that honor than I am.</t4308> <t4309>You say that it is a disorganized city, and I reply that, if order reigned there, I don't know why our house here would have to send to our house there someone who has long known the city and the city's business, and also possesses Tellson's trust.</t4309> <t4310>As for the inconveniences that may arise from the uncertainty of the means of transportation, the length of the trip, and the unpredictability of the weather, if I were not willing to face all those inconveniences in service to the house, after having grown old in it, who would be?</t4310>
<t4311>—I wish I could go myself—said Carlos, as if thinking out loud.</t4311>
<t4312>—Man!—exclaimed Lorry.</t4312><t4313>—I see that you are a top-notch advisor and a counselor without equal!</t4313> <t4314>So it’s you yourself, eh?</t4314> <t4315>And born in France, eh? Good advice, my friend, good advice!</t4315>
<t4316>—Precisely because I was born in France, my dear Mr. Lorry, that thought has crossed and frequently crosses my mind.</t4316> <t4317>I find it very natural for someone who retains some sympathy for that unfortunate people, who has left behind something that was theirs, and consequently believes that their voice would be heard, and that perhaps they could manage to contain the disorder a little bit, to think that way.</t4317> <t4318>Just last night, after you said goodbye to us, I was telling Lucie...</t4318>
<t4319>—You were saying to Lucía!...—repeated Lorry.</t4319><t4320>—Frankly!</t4320> <t4321>I am amazed that you are not ashamed to mention Lucía's name at this moment!</t4321> <t4322>Good heavens!</t4322> <t4323>Mentioning Lucía when you want to go to France under these circumstances!</t4323>
<t4324>—I haven't gone yet!—replied Carlos, smiling.</t4324><t4325>—More than for any other reason, I speak this way in order to counteract the intention you claim to have formed of going.</t4325>
<t4326>—Yes, I have formed it, Carlos: nothing could be more certain.</t4326> <t4327>I am going to speak to you frankly, my dear friend.</t4327> <t4328>You cannot even imagine the difficulties that all our businesses encounter, nor the danger that threatens our books and documents over there.</t4328> <t4329>Only God can know the fatal consequences that the loss or destruction of some of the documents stored there would entail for many people, and they are in danger of being lost, in danger of being destroyed, you know it as well as I do, as everyone knows.</t4329> <t4330>Who can say if today Paris will have burned from the four cardinal points, if tomorrow it will be looted in an orderly manner!</t4330> <t4331>Now then: only I can prevent the harm, by making a prudent selection and hiding the documents in question underground or moving them to a safe place, and for that, it is essential that I do not waste a second of time.</t4331> <t4332>Can I dawdle when the house knows what I have just said, and when the house says it... the house whose bread I have been eating for sixty years, the house into one of whose joints I have inserted myself like a wedge?</t4332> <t4333>Get out of here, man!</t4333> <t4334>Do you not know that I am a youngster compared to many who boast of being young and are nothing but decrepit old men?</t4334>
<t4335>—I admire the gallantry of your youthful spirit, Mr. Lorry!</t4335>
<t4336>—Quiet!</t4336> <t4337>Do not forget, my dear Carlos, that taking even the most insignificant object out of Paris today is next to impossible.</t4337> <t4338>Today we have received precious documents—I need not stress the utmost discretion,—and we have received them from the most unusual couriers you can imagine, couriers whose heads were hanging by a thread as they crossed the Barriers.</t4338> <t4339>In the past, our packages circulated from one nation to another without any difficulty: today everything is paralyzed.</t4339>
<t4340>—And do you plan to undertake the journey tonight?</t4340>
<t4341>—Tonight without fail.</t4341> <t4342>Things have gotten to the point where not a second can be wasted.</t4342>
<t4343>—Is no one accompanying you?</t4343>
<t4344>—People of all classes and conditions have been proposed to me, but I have not said a word to anyone.</t4344> <t4345>I plan to take Jeremiah with me.</t4345> <t4346>For many years, he has been my guard dog, my obligatory companion on my Sunday outings, and I am used to him.</t4346> <t4347>No one should see anything in Jeremiah other than an English bulldog, incapable of harboring any other intentions than to pounce on anyone who dares to touch a hair of his master's clothing.</t4347>
<t4348>—I repeat that I admire your bravery and your courage.</t4348>
<t4349>—And I repeat that you are talking nonsense, my friend Carlos.</t4349> <t4350>Once I have finished this small commission, it is possible that I will accept Tellson's proposition to retire and live peacefully.</t4350> <t4351>Then I will have plenty of time to think about the fact that I am getting old.</t4351>
<t4352>The dialogue that is transcribed here had taken place in Mr. Lorry's office, a yard or two away from a swarm of gentlemen, whose conversation, quite animated indeed, revolved around the revenge they would soon take on the vile populace.</t4352> <t4353>It was truly inconceivable that the gentlemen, in their capacity as emigrants, and as such, victims of countless setbacks, and the native English orthodoxy, spoke of that terrible Revolution as if it were a harvest of unsown fruits, as if all human means had not been employed to produce it, as if many observers, who necessarily had to understand the intolerable misery afflicting millions of France's children and the disastrous use of resources that could have made them prosperous and happy, had not seen and clearly announced its inevitable arrival.</t4353> <t4354>No man of sound mind and knowledge of the truth could hardly endure the series of nonsense spoken in a doctrinal tone, combined with extravagant plots to restore a state of affairs worn out and rotten to the core.</t4354> <t4355>The nonsense and extravagances, combined with the unrest in which Charles Darnay found himself, had made him impatient and nervous for several days, and the conversation he was hearing only served to exacerbate his impatience.</t4355>
<t4356>Among the talkers was Stryver, a man who had already climbed several rungs of the ladder of glory, and who was destined to climb many more, so it was not surprising that he leaned decidedly towards the noble class.</t4356> <t4357>He was speaking on this occasion with great fervor about the need to put an end to the common people once and for all, to mercilessly exterminate the vile rabble, to make the scum disappear from the earth, for which he advocated methods that, in effectiveness, were on par with that of the wise man who, wanting to permanently eliminate eagles, proposed that their tails be sprinkled with ground salt.</t4357> <t4358>Darnay listened to the lawyer with deep aversion, with repugnance.</t4358> <t4359>He even had thoughts of leaving so as not to hear him, and it is more than likely that he would have acted on them if the events themselves had not shown him the path he should follow.</t4359>
<t4360>The House had just approached Lorry and, leaving a closed and extremely worn sheet on the table, asked him if he had found any traces of the person to whom it was addressed.</t4360> <t4361>The House left the letter so close to Darnay that he had to read the address.</t4361> <t4362>It is true that it did not take him much effort, since the name written on the envelope was precisely his own.</t4362> <t4363>It read as follows.</t4363>
<t4364>"Very urgent."</t4364> <t4365>"To the Marquis de Saint-Evrémond of France."</t4365> <t4366>"Entrusted to Messrs. Tellson and Company, Bankers, London, England."</t4366>
<t4367>Dr. Manette, on the very morning of his daughter's marriage to Charles Darnay, demanded that he keep his last name a secret until the doctor released him from the obligation.</t4367> <t4368>No one knew his title, which was a secret even to his wife.</t4368> <t4369>As for Lorry, he could not have suspected it in the slightest.</t4369>
<t4370>—No—answered Lorry to the House.</t4370><t4371>—I have asked everyone who has come to this house, but no one has been able to tell me where that gentleman is.</t4371>
<t4372>As the hour to close the Bank had struck, almost all the friends of chattering had taken refuge in Lorry's office.</t4372> <t4373>He was holding the letter in his hands, looking at it with evident perplexity.</t4373> <t4374>The noble caste was also looking at it, but with anger, with a frown, as if instead of a piece of paper they were seeing an unworthy refugee of the race to which they belonged.</t4374> <t4375>This one, that one, the one over there, all had something to say against the Marquis who did not seem to appear anywhere.</t4375>
<t4376>—Nephew, if I am not mistaken... but of course, a degenerate successor of that illustrious and refined Marquis who was vilely murdered—said one.</t4376><t4377>—I have the fortune of never having seen him in my life.</t4377>
<t4378>—A coward who abandoned his post a few years ago—interjected another gentleman, who had left Paris with his head buried in the middle of a cartload of straw, feet in the air and half suffocated.</t4378>
<t4379>—Corrupted by the new doctrines—replied a third,—he declared open opposition against the last Marquis, abandoned his lands as soon as he inherited them, and entrusted them to a gang of ruffians.</t4379> <t4380>I hope they themselves will now give him the reward he has earned.</t4380>
<t4381>—Did he do that?—shouted Stryver.</t4381><t4382>—Is that man such a scoundrel?</t4382> <t4383>Let's see... let's see his infamous surname.</t4383>
<t4384>Darnay, whose resistance was nearing its end, touched Stryver on the shoulder and said:</t4384>
<t4385>—I know that gentleman.</t4385>
<t4386>—By all the devils together!... Do you know him?</t4386> <t4387>I feel it in my soul.</t4387>
<t4388>—Why?</t4388>
<t4389>—Are you asking why, Darnay? But haven't you heard what he has done?</t4389>
<t4390>—I've heard it, yes; but I ask you why you feel that I know you.</t4390>
<t4391>—In that case, I will repeat to you, Mr. Darnay, that I regret that you know that unworthy man, and that I am sorry you do not understand why I feel this way.</t4391> <t4392>It greatly distresses me to hear the inconceivable questions you ask.</t4392> <t4393>We are told here of a subject corrupted by the most pestilent and impious of rottenness, of an individual the vilest that has ever existed in the world, who abandons his goods to the scum of the earth, to the scoundrels whose creed is murder and theft, and you ask me why I regret that a man who dedicates himself to teaching youth knows him?</t4393> <t4394>Do you insist on knowing? Well, I will tell you!</t4394> <t4395>I regret it because I believe that wretches like the one in question contaminate those who know them.</t4395> <t4396>And you know it.</t4396>
<t4397>Darnay, containing himself with difficulty, replied:</t4397>
<t4398>—Perhaps you do not understand the gentleman to whom you are referring.</t4398>
<t4399>—But I know very well how to put you between a rock and a hard place, and I am going to do it—shouted Stryver.</t4399><t4400>—If that individual is a gentleman, I certainly do not understand him; you can tell him that from me, and give him my regards in passing.</t4400> <t4401>You can also add on my behalf that after abandoning the patrimonial goods to the rabble, I am greatly astonished that he has not put himself at the head of the thieves and murderers...</t4401> <t4402>But no, gentlemen, no; I, who know a little about human nature, dare to assure you that you will never find a subject like that who entrusts himself to the tender care of your humble protégés.</t4402> <t4403>No, gentlemen, no; if he shows anything of himself to those people, it will be, in any case, a pair of heels, and even then, only for the time it takes to put distance between them.</t4403>
<t4404>Having said these words, which earned the unanimous approval of his listeners, he went out onto Fleet Street.</t4404> <t4405>Seconds later, Lorry and Charles Darnay were left alone in the office.</t4405>
<t4406>"Since you know the person to whom the letter is addressed," said Lorry, "would you take charge of delivering it to them?"</t4406>
<t4407>—With great pleasure.</t4407>
<t4408>—Would you be so kind as to explain to him that it was undoubtedly sent here because they believed we knew him, and that, not knowing who he was or where he was, the letter has been held up for some time?</t4408>
<t4409>—I will do so.</t4409> <t4410>When are you leaving for Paris?</t4410>
<t4411>—At eight, I leave from right here.</t4411>
<t4412>—I will return to say goodbye to him.</t4412>
<t4413>Discontented with himself, and even more so with Stryver and his compatriots, Darnay left the Bank building and, as soon as he reached a corner where he believed he was out of sight of prying eyes, he opened the letter, which was written in the following terms:</t4413>
<t4414>"Abbey Prison, Paris."</t4414>
<t4415>"June 21, 1792."</t4415>
<t4416>Mr. Marquis:</t4416>
<t4417>»After running for a long time in imminent danger of losing my life at the hands of the villagers, I have been captured, subjected to a thousand violences and outrages, and finally taken to Paris, which I was forced to travel to on foot.</t4417> <t4418>The bitterness I endured on the way is not to be recounted here; and that is not all; my house has been destroyed... razed to the ground.</t4418>
<t4419>"The crime of which I am accused, the one that has me buried in jail, Mr. Marquis, the crime for which I will appear before the Court and which will cost me my head (if you do not lend me your generous assistance) is, according to them, that of treason against the majesty of the people, whom they claim I have sold out to protect an emigrant."</t4419> <t4420>"In vain have I made it clear to them that, far from acting against them, I have acted in their favor, adhering to your instructions, Mr. Marquis; in vain have I argued that prior to the confiscation of the emigrants' properties, I had forgiven the taxes that the people stopped paying, that I did not collect the rents, that I did not resort to the courts."</t4420> <t4421>"To all my representations they reply that I acted in favor of an emigrant, and I ask myself: where is that emigrant?"</t4421>
<t4422>"Ah, my good Lord Marquis!"</t4422> <t4423>"Where is that emigrant?"</t4423> <t4424>"I ask while I sleep; where is he?"</t4424> <t4425>"I turn my eyes to the heavens, and ask them; will he come to save me?"</t4425> <t4426>"They do not answer me."</t4426> <t4427>"Ah, Lord Marquis!"</t4427> <t4428>"I send my cry of anguish across the seas, in case God wills it to reach his ears through the mediation of the great Tellson's Bank, so well known in Paris."</t4428>
<t4429>"For the love of God, for fairness, for justice, for generosity, for the immaculate honor of your noble surname, Mr. Marquis, I beg you to come to my aid and save me from the death that threatens me."</t4429> <t4430>"My only crime is having been faithful to you... Oh Mr. Marquis!"</t4430> <t4431>"I trust that you will reciprocate my loyalty."</t4431>
<t4432>"From this dungeon where all horrors have their seat, from this antechamber of death, I send you, Mr. Marquis, the expression of my painful loyalty, together with the offering of my unfortunate services."</t4432>
<t4433>"Your afflicted servant,"</t4433>
<t4434>"Gabelle."</t4434>
<t4435>The reading of the letter that remains copied infiltrated into Darnay's latent unease a vigorous torrent of life.</t4435> <t4436>The danger looming over the head of an old servant, certainly one of the best, who had committed no other crime than being loyal to him and his family, was for Darnay like a whip received full in the face.</t4436> <t4437>The shame rose to his face with such force that while he walked aimlessly without knowing what resolution to adopt, he didn't even dare to look at the passersby.</t4437>
<t4438>He knew very well that, driven by the horror of the deed that put a fitting end to the misdeeds and the terrible reputation of his ancient family, prompted by the suspicions his uncle had inspired in him and by the aversion with which his conscience viewed the ruinous factory that, according to his lineage, he was duty-bound to sustain and strengthen, he had acted in an imperfect manner.</t4438> <t4439>He knew very well that by yielding to the love he felt for Lucía, by renouncing the position he was supposed to occupy in society, he had rushed into things, he had acted with reprehensible recklessness.</t4439> <t4440>He knew very well that his resolution should have been carried out personally, as he knew he had intended to do so, and that, nevertheless, he did not do it.</t4440>
<t4441>The happiness of the home that had been created in London, the need to lead an active life, the continuous upheavals of the time, so abrupt and so rapid that plans not well matured the previous week fell apart the following week under the overwhelming force of new events, were weighty circumstances to which he yielded; he knew it very well; but it was also not hidden from him that, if he yielded to the force of circumstances with reluctance, he did not attempt to oppose them with continuous and formal resistance.</t4441> <t4442>His conscience told him that he wished to act and that several times he had been lurking for the opportunity; but it added that just as many times he let the opportunity pass, while the nobility fled from France by all roads and paths, while their properties were confiscated and destroyed, and even the names of those who had until then been favored by fortune were erased from the book of life.</t4442>
<t4443>But on the other hand, he had oppressed no one, he had sent no one to jail.</t4443> <t4444>Far from having trampled on anyone to collect his rents, he had freely and spontaneously abandoned his property, sought refuge in a foreign nation, and earned the bread he put in his mouth through his own effort.</t4444> <t4445>Mr. Gabelle had administered an impoverished estate according to written instructions that directed him to treat the people well, to give them what little could be given... firewood to keep warm in winter and some fruits to help them through the summer, as the creditors allowed nothing else... and surely he would have cited these facts in his defense.</t4445> <t4446>These were public facts, facts that could easily be proven; and if the facts in question justified the administrator before the people, it goes without saying that they were a patent of friendship with the people in favor of the one who issued the orders that he followed.</t4446>
<t4447>These considerations strengthened the resolution to make the trip to Paris that Darnay had almost adopted prior to receiving Gabelle's letter.</t4447>
<t4448>Yes.</t4448> <t4449>Similar to the sailor from the ancient legend, the winds and currents had dragged him until they placed his ship within the radius of influence of the Magnetic Mountain, and it attracted him with an increasingly irresistible force.</t4449> <t4450>All the thoughts that germinated in his mind impelled him, pushed him towards the center of that terrible attraction.</t4450> <t4451>His initial impatience obeyed the thought that his unfortunate homeland, guided by bad instruments, pursued bad objectives and was running headlong into the abyss, while he, who perhaps could have given a better direction to the national aspirations, remained in London without intervening, without attempting something that would put an end to the brutal effusion of blood, something that would secure the rights to mercy, to humanity, unknown at the time.</t4451> <t4452>When those remorseful feelings were already stirring in his soul, the conduct of the elderly Lorry came to multiply their strength a hundredfold, as he, obedient to the voice of duty, hastened to face the tremendous risks involved in a journey to France under those circumstances, and if that were not enough, there came the comments of the gentlemen, comments that deeply wounded him, and those of Stryver, a thousand times harsher than those of the others.</t4452> <t4453>All this was followed by the letter from Gabelle, the letter of an innocent prisoner who, coming to the edge of the grave, made a desperate appeal to his justice, to his honor, and to his name.</t4453>
<t4454>It didn't take long to decide; he would go to Paris.</t4454>
<t4455>Yes.</t4455> <t4456>The Magnetized Mountain was pulling him, and there was no other choice but to steer the bow of his skiff towards it.</t4456> <t4457>He was unaware that there were reefs in the seas he was about to sail, nor did he believe that the voyage would pose any dangers to him.</t4457> <t4458>The intention that guided him to act as he had, even if his work had remained incomplete, seemed to him more than sufficient to earn him the gratitude of France, as soon as he set foot on its soil and asserted the rights that supported him.</t4458> <t4459>Before his eyes rose the glorious vision of having acted rightly, and he even began to harbor illusions that he would have some influence in steering that horrendous revolution, which had risen with such uncontrollable fury, threatening to destroy everything in existence.</t4459>
<t4460>Having made his decision, he believed that neither Lucie nor Doctor Manette should know about it until he had put it into practice.</t4460> <t4461>As for Lucie, it was only natural to spare her the pain of separation, and as for her father, whose aversion to thinking about the places where he had endured so much suffering in past years was so strong, it was also best not to speak to him about the plan, but rather about its execution, the only way to avoid causing him painful doubts.</t4461>
<t4462>Such were the thoughts that agitated him until it was time to say goodbye to Lorry.</t4462> <t4463>He would not confide his intentions to him either.</t4463> <t4464>He would know them in Paris when they were already accomplished, when he paid him a visit, and this visit, he would make as soon as he arrived in the capital of France.</t4464>
<t4465>In front of the door of Tellson's Bank, a stagecoach was waiting.</t4465> <t4466>Next to the carriage door, Jeremiah Lorry stood guard.</t4466>
<t4467>—I have delivered the letter to the gentleman to whom it was addressed—said Darnay to Lorry.</t4467><t4468>—I did not want to bring a written reply that might cause you trouble; but I accepted a verbal response, trusting that you will have no objection to conveying it.</t4468>
<t4469>"With great pleasure, as long as it is not too dangerous," replied Lorry.</t4469>
<t4470>—It is not, although it must be received by a man who is imprisoned in the Abbey.</t4470>
<t4471>—What is his name?—asked Lorry, taking a little notebook out of his pocket.</t4471>
<t4472>—Gabelle.</t4472>
<t4473>—Gabelle.</t4473> <t4474>And what should I say to the unfortunate prisoner Gabelle?</t4474>
<t4475>—Simply these words: "He has received the letter and will come."</t4475>
<t4476>—Without saying when?</t4476>
<t4477>—He will embark on the journey tomorrow night.</t4477>
<t4478>—Should I not mention any names?</t4478>
<t4479>—No.</t4479>
<t4480>After helping Lorry bundle up in two or three layers, under which he was already wearing two or three coats, he went out accompanying him to Fleet Street.</t4480>
<t4481>—Give my love to both Lucías—said Lorry at the moment the stagecoach departed.</t4481><t4482>—Take good care of them until I return.</t4482>
<t4483>Carlos Darnay nodded, smiled with an ambiguous expression, and stood watching the carriage as it moved away at the horses' long trot.</t4483>
<t4484>That night, it was the fourteenth of August, Charles Darnay went to bed very late, as he first had to write two letters; one addressed to Lucie, in which he explained the unavoidable duty he had to go to Paris and detailed extensively the reasons that, in his opinion, removed all kinds of risks from his person, and another to the doctor, to whom he entrusted the care of Lucie and her little daughter.</t4484> <t4485>To both, he promised to write again as soon as he reached the end of his journey.</t4485>
<t4486>It was a day of trial for Darnay, the one he had to spend with his beloved family while keeping a secret deep in his heart that no one could suspect; but a loving glance directed at his wife, so cheerful, so confident, strengthened his resolve not to tell her anything, and the day passed without incident.</t4486> <t4487>At dusk, he embraced her, telling her that an unforeseen matter required him to leave, but that his absence would be very brief, and he left.</t4487> <t4488>He had already secretly taken a trunk with the necessary clothes out of the house.</t4488>
<t4489>He entrusted the two letters to a servant worthy of all trust, with orders to deliver them at midnight, not a minute before, took a horse, and set out on the journey to Dover.</t4489>
<t4490>He felt faint; but the desperate cry of the poor prisoner who appealed to his justice, his honor, his generosity, gave him strength to leave behind what was most dear to him in the world and to steer his ship towards the Magnetic Mountain that was drawing him in.</t4490>
<t4491>THIRD BOOK</t4491>
<t4492>THE COURSE OF THE STORM</t4492>
<t4493>I.</t4493>
<t4494>IN SECRET</t4494>
<t4495>Little by little, the traveler shortened the distance that separated him from Paris.</t4495> <t4496>We are in the autumn of the year seventeen ninety-two.</t4496> <t4497>He would not have lacked detestable roads, terrible carriages, and horses afflicted by old age that hindered his progress, even if the dethroned king of France had continued to occupy his throne and reign amidst splendors of glory; but aside from those obstacles, the alteration of the times had accumulated a thousand more.</t4497> <t4498>All the city gates, all the town entrances, were manned by bands of patriotic citizens, armed with national muskets ready to fire on their own, who stopped everyone entering or leaving, to subject them to strict interrogations, meticulously examine their documents, see if their names appeared on the lists they had, and either allow them to continue their journey or arrest them, as their whim advised, for the good of the newly born One and Indivisible Republic, of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death.</t4498>
<t4499>Charles Darnay had traveled very few leagues of French territory when he began to realize the impossibility he would face in treading those eternal roads again, unless he was first declared a good citizen of Paris.</t4499> <t4500>But he could no longer turn back; whatever fate destiny had in store for him, he had no choice but to continue the journey to the end.</t4500> <t4501>Behind him, he left an open road, free of barriers and ditches, but nonetheless, he knew that between England and himself stood obstacles a thousand times more insurmountable than the strongest iron gates.</t4501> <t4502>Such was the universal vigilance surrounding him, that if he had been traveling within the meshes of a thick steel net, or well confined inside a cage, he would not have considered his freedom more lost.</t4502>
<t4503>That universal surveillance not only forced him to stop twenty times a day on the main roads, at the post relays, but also hindered and delayed his progress just as many times each day, sometimes catching up with him and ordering him to turn back, sometimes accompanying him and preventing him from advancing as quickly as he desired.</t4503> <t4504>He had been traveling through French territory for several days when one night he went to bed early in an inn in a small, insignificant town, located quite far from Paris.</t4504>
<t4505>To the letter that Gabelle sent him from the Abbey prison, he owed having come so far, but upon reaching the town we are talking about, he was met with so many difficulties at the gates that he understood the crisis was very near.</t4505> <t4506>Therefore, it did not surprise him much to be awakened in the middle of the night in the bed of the inn where he had lain down with the intention of sleeping until the next morning.</t4506>
<t4507>Upon waking, their eyes met a local official, of a timid temperament, and three patriots armed to the teeth, wearing bright red caps and smoking enormous pipes.</t4507> <t4508>The three with the caps took a seat on his bed.</t4508>
<t4509>—Emigrant—said the official,—I have decided to send you to Paris with an escort.</t4509>
<t4510>—Citizen, my greatest desire is to reach Paris, but I can perfectly do without the escort.</t4510>
<t4511>—Silence!—shouted a red cap, striking the bed with the butt of the musket.</t4511><t4512>—Shut up, aristocrat!</t4512>
<t4513>—This good patriot is right—said the official timidly.</t4513><t4514>—You are an aristocrat, and therefore, you must make the journey under the supervision of an escort.</t4514>
<t4515>—The choice is not in my hands—replied Charles Darnay.</t4515>
<t4516>—Election!—exclaimed one of the red caps.</t4516><t4517>—Have you ever seen such a thing?</t4517> <t4518>As if we weren't doing him a favor by sparing him from adorning a lamppost hook from this moment on!</t4518>
<t4519>—The observation of the good patriot couldn't be more accurate—interjected the official.</t4519><t4520>—Get up and get dressed, emigrant.</t4520>
<t4521>Darnay obeyed, who was immediately taken to the guardhouse, where he found many patriots wearing their corresponding red caps, some smoking and others drinking by the warmth of the fire.</t4521> <t4522>After being forced to pay a large sum for an escort he had not requested, he set out on the journey at three in the morning.</t4522>
<t4523>The escort consisted of two mounted patriots, who rode at their sides, with red caps adorned with tricolor cockades, and they were armed with muskets and national sabers.</t4523> <t4524>The escorted man handled his horse, but there was a rope tied to the bridle of the horse, the other end of which was tied to one of the patriots' wrists.</t4524> <t4525>In this manner, they made the journey, enduring a freezing drizzle that the wind blew against their faces, at a heavy trot, along uneven paths interspersed with extensive mudflats.</t4525> <t4526>Without making any changes during the journey other than switching horses, they finally reached the capital.</t4526>
<t4527>They traveled during the night, stopping an hour or two before daybreak, and sleeping until the twilight of the afternoon.</t4527> <t4528>The escort dressed in such extreme poverty that to cover their bare legs, they had to resort to straw, with which they padded them.</t4528> <t4529>Apart from the inconveniences of the journey, the annoyance of being escorted, and the inherent dangers of depending on patriots who were chronically drunk and armed with muskets that fired on their own, Charles Darnay could dismiss all kinds of fears, since it was to be expected that, as soon as he referred to his merits, which would be confirmed by the prisoner of the Abbey, they would hasten to treat him as a man friendly to the people.</t4529>
<t4530>However, when they arrived in the city of Beauvais at dusk, and consequently, when the streets were filled with people, he could not help but understand that things were taking on an alarming turn.</t4530> <t4531>In the courtyard of the inn, many groups gathered who, initially looking at him with a frown, eventually began to shout:</t4531>
<t4532>—Death to the emigrant!</t4532>
<t4533>Darnay stopped at the moment he was about to dismount, and from the saddle, he replied:</t4533>
<t4534>—Emigrated? No, my friends.</t4534> <t4535>Don't you see me here, my friends, in France, by my own free will?</t4535>
<t4536>—You are a damned emigrant and a scoundrel aristocrat!—shouted a blacksmith, lunging at him with a hammer raised high.</t4536>
<t4537>The manager of the post house intervened between the furious blacksmith and the rider, and as someone who wishes to avoid an unpleasant scene, said:</t4537>
<t4538>—Leave him, friends, leave him!</t4538> <t4539>He will be judged in Paris.</t4539>
<t4540>—They will judge!—repeated the blacksmith, brandishing the hammer.</t4540><t4541>—They will condemn him as a traitor.</t4541>
<t4542>The mobs let out fierce roars of approval.</t4542>
<t4543>Darnay, as soon as he could be heard, exclaimed:</t4543>
<t4544>—You are mistaken, my friends, you are mistaken.</t4544> <t4545>I am not a traitor.</t4545>
<t4546>—You lie!—roared the blacksmith.</t4546><t4547>—According to the decree, he is a traitor!...</t4547> <t4548>His life belongs to the people... his cursed existence is not his own!</t4548>
<t4549>In the gazes of the mobs, Carlos Darnay read one of those ferocious assaults whose outcome is always a man torn to pieces.</t4549> <t4550>Such a fate would have befallen him if it had not been for the post house manager, who forced the horse to enter the courtyard.</t4550> <t4551>The escort followed our friend, and the manager immediately closed and bolted the door.</t4551> <t4552>The blacksmith struck the door with the hammer blows he could not deliver to the head of the emigrant; the mobs roared in indignation, but nothing more happened.</t4552>
<t4553>—What decree is that which the blacksmith mentioned?—asked Darnay to the owner of the inn, after thanking him for his fortunate mediation.</t4553>
<t4554>—It is the decree that orders the sale at public auction of the assets of the emigrants—replied the person questioned.</t4554>
<t4555>—When was it enacted?</t4555>
<t4556>—The fourteenth day.</t4556>
<t4557>—The same day I left England.</t4557>
<t4558>—Everyone claims that it is nothing more than the first of the series, already drafted... or that will be drafted shortly, which banish the emigrants and condemn to death those who return to set foot on French territory.</t4558> <t4559>That's what the blacksmith meant when he said that your life was not yours, but the people's.</t4559>
<t4560>—But I suppose such decrees have not yet been promulgated, have they?</t4560>
<t4561>—I can't be sure—replied the postmaster, shrugging his shoulders.</t4561><t4562>—They may not have been promulgated yet, or maybe they have; but it doesn't matter.</t4562>
<t4563>Darnay rested until midnight lying on a pile of straw, leaving the city when its inhabitants were deep in sleep.</t4563> <t4564>Among the many radical changes in customs that Darnay could observe during his eventful journey, changes that gave it a strong fantastical color, not the least was the lack of sleep among the patriots.</t4564> <t4565>Often, after a long and heavy walk along solitary paths, they would arrive late at night to a village whose inhabitants, instead of sleeping peacefully, danced fantastic dances around a Liberty tree, or sang hymns to Liberty.</t4565> <t4566>Fortunately, however, that night Beauvais deemed it convenient to rest, thanks to which the travelers were able to continue their journey along deserted roads, covered with mud and water, skirting uncultivated fields that had produced no harvest that year, among burned-down hamlets, and with the risk of unexpectedly receiving a gunshot fired by any of the countless patriots swarming everywhere.</t4566>
<t4567>Near the walls of Paris they were, when they received the greeting of the first lights of the day.</t4567> <t4568>At the barrier, they found a strong guard.</t4568>
<t4569>"Where are the prisoner's documents?" asked a resolute-looking man, called by the sentinel, in an authoritative tone.</t4569>
<t4570>Carlos Darnay, disgusted upon hearing such an unpleasant word, replied that he was not a prisoner, but a traveler who arrived freely and voluntarily, a French citizen, entrusted to the custody of an escort that the disturbed state of the country made necessary, and that he had paid for out of his own pocket.</t4570>
<t4571>—Where are this prisoner's documents?—repeated the same individual, without paying the slightest attention to Darnay or his words.</t4571>
<t4572>The patriot of the perpetual drunkenness took them out of his hat, where he carried them, handing them over to the person who asked for them.</t4572> <t4573>Gabelle's letter caused some confusion and not a little surprise in him, while also capturing his attention, which he focused on Darnay.</t4573>
<t4574>Without saying a word, he left the escort and the escorted and entered the guardhouse, leaving the travelers on horseback in front of the door.</t4574> <t4575>Carlos Darnay, meanwhile, was able to observe that the guard was made up of soldiers and patriots, more of the latter than the former, and that, while the carts bringing provisions to the city or those engaged in any kind of trade encountered no difficulties entering, they faced very great difficulties when trying to leave, even if they were the humblest of people.</t4575> <t4576>Men and women, pack and draft animals, and carts and coaches of all kinds waited to be allowed to leave; but the law regarding prior identification was enforced so rigidly that although hundreds reached the barrier, they exited one by one and at long intervals.</t4576> <t4577>Those who knew it would be a long time before their turn came waited lying in the street, where they slept or smoked, while others engaged in lively conversations or passed the time walking around.</t4577> <t4578>The red caps and tricolor cockades were mandatory attire that everyone wore, regardless of age or gender.</t4578>
<t4579>The wait for Charles Darnay would last half an hour, during which time he was able to make the observations that are noted, when the same character, apparently the chief of the barrier guard, came out again, who, after giving the escort a receipt for the person escorted, ordered him to dismount.</t4579> <t4580>Darnay obeyed, and the men who had accompanied him there took charge of his horse and left without entering the city.</t4580>
<t4581>The head of the guard led Darnay to the guardhouse, which reeked of cheap wine and tobacco, where there were several groups of soldiers and patriots, some asleep and others awake, the latter drunk and the former sober, and some on the borders of wakefulness and sleep, and of sobriety and drunkenness.</t4581> <t4582>Two oil lamps cast a very questionable light over the guardhouse, on one of whose walls there was a table, upon which some records could be seen.</t4582> <t4583>A coarse-looking officer, seated in front of the table, was in charge of the records.</t4583>
<t4584>—Citizen Defarge—said the character who had introduced Darnay, while taking a sheet of paper—Is this the emigrant Evrémonde?</t4584>
<t4585>—This is it.</t4585>
<t4586>—How old are you, Evrémonde?</t4586>
<t4587>—Thirty-seven.</t4587>
<t4588>—Married, Evrémonde?</t4588>
<t4589>—Yes.</t4589>
<t4590>—Where?</t4590>
<t4591>—In England.</t4591>
<t4592>—I believe it.</t4592> <t4593>Where is your wife, Evrémonde?</t4593>
<t4594>—In England.</t4594>
<t4595>—I believe so too.</t4595> <t4596>You are consigned, Evrémonde, to the prison of La Force.</t4596>
<t4597>—God in Heaven!—exclaimed Darnay—By virtue of what law, and for what crime or offense?</t4597>
<t4598>After a few seconds of silent contemplation, the official replied:</t4598>
<t4599>—Since you left France, Evrémonde, we have been governed by new laws, and what pertains to crimes and offenses has changed profoundly.</t4599>
<t4600>"I beg you to bear in mind, citizen, that I have come voluntarily, yielding to the written plea on that paper before your eyes," replied Darnay.</t4600><t4601>"I ask for nothing more than the opportunity to do what a fellow countryman of mine requests.</t4601> <t4602>Am I not within my rights?"</t4602>
<t4603>"Emigrants have no rights, Evrémonde," was the stolid reply of the official.</t4603>
<t4604>After giving Darnay a sinister smile, he wrote a few lines, folded the paper, and handed it to Defarge, saying:</t4604>
<t4605>—Secret.</t4605>
<t4606>Defarge indicated to the prisoner to follow him.</t4606> <t4607>The prisoner obeyed, accompanied by two armed patriots who positioned themselves to his right and left.</t4607>
<t4608>As they left the guardhouse to enter Paris, Defarge asked the prisoner in a low voice:</t4608>
<t4609>—Are you the one who married the daughter of Dr. Manette, once a prisoner in the now non-existent Bastille?</t4609>
<t4610>—Yes—replied Darnay, looking at him with surprise.</t4610>
<t4611>—My name is Defarge and I own a tavern in the San Antonio neighborhood.</t4611> <t4612>You may know me by reputation.</t4612>
<t4613>—My wife went to your house to claim her father...</t4613> <t4614>Yes, yes!</t4614>
<t4615>It seems that the word "woman" awakened somber memories in Defarge, for he said with brusque impatience:</t4615>
<t4616>—Do you want to tell me, in the name of that newly born woman called Guillotine, why on earth you have come to France?</t4616>
<t4617>—Not a minute ago you heard me explain what was the cause of my trip.</t4617> <t4618>Do you think I didn't tell the truth?</t4618>
<t4619>—True, it couldn't be more fatal for you—replied Defarge, furrowing his brow and looking intently at his interlocutor.</t4619>
<t4620>—It is true that I find myself lost here.</t4620> <t4621>I see everything so disrupted, so different from what it used to be, so unpleasant, that I confess I don't even know where to turn my eyes.</t4621> <t4622>Would you do me a small favor?</t4622>
<t4623>—Absolutely none—replied Defarge, with a gaze as if lost in space.</t4623>
<t4624>—You don't want to answer a question for me, not even one?</t4624>
<t4625>—We'll see... Depending on how it is.</t4625> <t4626>You can do it.</t4626>
<t4627>—In the prison where I am so unjustly confined, will I be able to communicate freely with the outside world?</t4627>
<t4628>—You will see it yourself.</t4628>
<t4629>—Do you intend to bury me in it, without judging me, without condemning me, without giving me the means to justify and defend myself?</t4629>
<t4630>—You'll see for yourself...</t4630> <t4631>But if that were the case, so what? Many others as good as you have found themselves buried in worse prisons.</t4631>
<t4632>—But not because of me, citizen Defarge.</t4632>
<t4633>The somber expression on Defarge's face became extraordinarily pronounced upon hearing the response, after which he continued walking in silence.</t4633> <t4634>As his taciturnity increased, the hopes that Darnay initially had of softening the man dissipated.</t4634>
<t4635>—For me, it is of exceptional importance, as you know as well as I do, citizen Defarge, to inform Mr. Lorry, from Tellson's Bank, an English gentleman who is currently in Paris, of the simple fact, without any comment, that I have been imprisoned in La Force.</t4635> <t4636>Would you do me the favor of making him aware of this?</t4636>
<t4637>—I will do absolutely nothing in your favor—replied Defarge.</t4637><t4638>—I owe myself to my country and the people.</t4638> <t4639>I have sworn to serve both against you.</t4639> <t4640>Expect nothing from me.</t4640>
<t4641>Darnay fell silent, both because he considered all chances of obtaining even the slightest favor from that man to be definitively lost, and because his wounded pride led him to view his pleas as humiliations.</t4641> <t4642>He couldn't help but notice, as he silently walked through the streets, how accustomed the people were to the sight of prisoners passing by.</t4642> <t4643>Not even the children paid attention to him.</t4643> <t4644>Some passersby turned their heads and pointed at him, indicating that he was an aristocrat, and nothing more.</t4644> <t4645>Indeed, seeing a well-dressed man being taken to prison was as common and natural as seeing a worker heading to his job with his tools in hand.</t4645> <t4646>In a narrow, dark, and dirty alley they had to cross, they encountered a highly agitated street orator, delivering fervent speeches to an equally agitated audience, extolling the crimes committed against the sovereign people by the King, the royal family, and the nobles.</t4646> <t4647>From the few words that reached Darnay's ears, he was able to infer that the King had been imprisoned and that foreign ambassadors had left Paris en masse, news of which he was entirely unaware, as during his journey, the individuals escorting him, along with the universal surveillance, had kept him in such absolute isolation that he had heard nothing.</t4647>
<t4648>As is natural, he understood that the dangers threatening him were infinitely greater and infinitely more numerous than he had supposed when leaving England; he understood that the dangers were multiplying at an alarming rate and that they would multiply even more; he could not help but confess to himself that the idea of making the journey would never have crossed his mind had he foreseen the events that had unfolded in recent days.</t4648> <t4649>And yet, his fears, when examined in the light of the most recent incidents, were not as great as they seem they should have been.</t4649> <t4650>No matter how nebulous the future appeared to him, it was an unknown future that, in its very obscurity, held a certain hope.</t4650> <t4651>As unaware as those who lived thousands of years before him, he was to the horrible massacres that, continuing day after day, night after night, would drown the always blessed harvest season in torrents of blood.</t4651> <t4652>He barely knew by name the "newly born woman called Guillotine," just as the general populace barely knew her by name, for in those days, even those who had brought her into the world could not have imagined the dreadful deeds that would soon envelop her in an immense bloody aura.</t4652>
<t4653>He suspected that he would be the victim of an arbitrary arrest, that he would be treated with irritating injustice, that he would have to endure deprivations and hardships, of which the least would not be being separated from his beloved wife and his idolized daughter; he suspected all of this; moreover, he considered it undeniable; but beyond that, he feared nothing.</t4653>
<t4654>Such were the reflections that overwhelmed him when he arrived at the prison called La Force.</t4654> <t4655>A man with a fierce face opened the wicket.</t4655>
<t4656>—The emigrant Evrémonde—said Defarge, introducing the prisoner.</t4656>
<t4657>—Crowned demons!</t4657> <t4658>But is this procession never going to end?—exclaimed the one with the fierce face.</t4658>
<t4659>Defarge took the receipt that the jailer handed him, without paying attention to his exclamation, and withdrew along with the two patriots.</t4659>
<t4660>—Thunder and lightning!—grumbled the jailer, now alone with his wife.</t4660><t4661>—This is a river that always flows!</t4661>
<t4662>The jailer's wife, who probably did not have the appropriate response in her repository of replies for the previous exclamation, simply answered:</t4662>
<t4663>—You have to be patient, my friend.</t4663>
<t4664>The sounds of a bell that the woman rang evoked three jailers, who said in unison:</t4664>
<t4665>—Long live Freedom!</t4665>
<t4666>The choir did not seem the most appropriate to be sung in a place like that, but greater anomalies are seen in the world.</t4666>
<t4667>La Force prison was a gloomy, repugnant, and filthy building, where one could breathe the foul atmosphere of death.</t4667> <t4668>It is truly astonishing how quickly the sense of smell detects the odor of flesh stored in places like that, especially when they are not suitable for the purpose and, in addition, are neglected.</t4668>
<t4669>—And also secret!—murmured the warden while reading the paper.</t4669><t4670>—As if I weren't already so full of them that one of these days I'll explode!</t4670>
<t4671>With signs of very bad temper, he skewered the paper with a spike that pierced many others, and began to pace around the vaulted room without paying the slightest attention to the prisoner, whom he kept waiting for more than half an hour.</t4671>
<t4672>"Follow me, emigrant," he finally said, taking the keys.</t4672>
<t4673>The warden led the new inmate through a corridor and a staircase, and after several minutes, and not without opening many doors during the walk and closing them again after passing through, they arrived at a large, low-ceilinged, vaulted room, crowded with prisoners of both sexes.</t4673> <t4674>The women were sitting around a table, reading or writing, knitting, sewing, or embroidering, while the men, for the most part, were standing behind the chairs occupied by the women, except for a few who were amusing themselves by walking around.</t4674>
<t4675>So gloomy was the room, so somber the expression of the people crowded there, so pronounced the yellowness that privations and misery had created on their faces, that Carlos Darnay believed he was among a large collection of the dead.</t4675> <t4676>There were only ghosts there.</t4676> <t4677>Ghosts of beauty, ghosts of elegance, ghosts of haughtiness, ghosts of pride, ghosts of frivolity, ghosts of talent, ghosts of youth, ghosts of old age, all of them waiting for the hour to leave the inhospitable shore of the world, all of them fixing their eyes on the newcomer, eyes that death had altered as soon as they entered the antechamber of its domains.</t4677>
<t4678>Darnay remained motionless, rigid, due to his astonishment.</t4678> <t4679>The appearance of the warden, who stood beside him, no less than that of the jailers who moved from one place to another, undoubtedly in full exercise of their high functions, was so rough, so brutal, so ferocious, especially when compared to that of the distressed mothers and the beautiful daughters stored there, with the coquetry and distinction typical of well-born young women and the refined manners of the high-ranking lady, that Darnay had to reinforce his belief that he had been confined in the mansion of specters.</t4679>
<t4680>"—In my own name and on behalf of all the unfortunate companions gathered here," said a gentleman with courtly manners, stepping forward, "I have the honor of welcoming you to La Force, and to lament with you the calamity that brings you here."</t4680> <t4681>"May it be of brief duration and end with happiness!"</t4681> <t4682>"Now then, expressing our wishes would be an unforgivable impertinence anywhere else, but not here."</t4682> <t4683>"We take the liberty of asking your name and status."</t4683>
<t4684>Darnay hastened to comply with the wishes expressed by the gentleman.</t4684>
<t4685>—I suppose you are not here "in secret"—replied the gentleman, following with his gaze the warden who was crossing the room at that moment.</t4685>
<t4686>—Two or three times I have heard that password mentioned in reference to me, but I do not know what it could mean.</t4686>
<t4687>—Oh, what a pity!</t4687> <t4688>We truly regret it...</t4688> <t4689>But do not be discouraged.</t4689> <t4690>Many have come here "in secret" and then their situation has changed.</t4690>
<t4691>Then he added, raising his voice:</t4691>
<t4692>—With deep regret, I inform my colleagues that... in secret.</t4692>
<t4693>As Charles Darnay approached the door defended with a thick grate, next to which the jailer awaited him, strong murmurs of commiseration arose, mixed with phrases of pity from the women, who strove to encourage him.</t4693> <t4694>Having reached the mentioned door, Charles turned and thanked those he was leaving from the bottom of his heart.</t4694> <t4695>The door was closed by the hand of the jailer, and the spectral apparitions faded away forever.</t4695>
<t4696>The door gave access to a spiral staircase, which Darnay ascended following his guide.</t4696> <t4697>After climbing forty steps, carefully counted by the prisoner of half an hour, the jailer opened a low and very black door and entered a solitary cell.</t4697> <t4698>It was very cold, smelled of mold, but it was not dark.</t4698>
<t4699>—Yours—said the warden.</t4699>
<t4700>—Why are they locking me up alone?</t4700>
<t4701>—That is what I don't know.</t4701>
<t4702>—I suppose I will be allowed to buy paper, pen, and ink?</t4702>
<t4703>—For the moment, no.</t4703> <t4704>They will visit you... I don't know when, and then you can request that favor.</t4704> <t4705>You can buy food, but nothing else.</t4705>
<t4706>In the cell, there was a chair, a table, and a straw mattress.</t4706> <t4707>The warden, after subjecting the cell's furniture to a meticulous inspection, left, leaving Darnay alone.</t4707>
<t4708>—I can say that I am dead and buried—murmured the unfortunate one.</t4708><t4709>—Five steps by four and a half... five steps by four and a half—he repeated mechanically, pacing the cell in all directions and counting at the same time.</t4709>
<t4710>The noise of the city reached his ears transformed into a kind of muffled drumbeat mixed with shrill human voices.</t4710>
<t4711>—Five steps by four and a half...</t4711> <t4712>Made shoes... five steps by four and a half... made shoes... shoes...</t4712>
<t4713>The prisoner quickened his pace and tried to count, in order to drive away the thought of the one making shoes, which threatened to become a fixed idea.</t4713>
<t4714>—The specters vanished as soon as I crossed the gate's door—he kept thinking.</t4714><t4715>—I saw among them a lady dressed in black, who was leaning on the windowsill.</t4715> <t4716>The light shone fully on her golden hair, and she seemed to...</t4716> <t4717>My God... My God!...</t4717> <t4718>Will I ever walk again through the villages visited by the sunlight, through the villages where people awaken?</t4718> <t4719>Making shoes... making shoes... making shoes...</t4719> <t4720>Five steps by four and a half... five steps by four and a half...</t4720>
<t4721>The prisoner walked with increasing speed, always absorbed in the same thoughts, always counting, always having before his mind's eye the vision of the shoemaker, while the din of the city continued to sound in his ears like a muffled drumroll mixed with cries from voices he knew and loved, with heart-wrenching wails emitted by throats that until then had barely given voice to sounds other than those reflecting the joy of the heart.</t4721>
<t4722>II.</t4722>
<t4723>THE WHETSTONE</t4723>
<t4724>The Tellson Bank, established in the Saint Germain district of Paris, occupied a wing of an immense building, preceded by a garden separated from the street by a fairly high wall and a very solid gate.</t4724> <t4725>The building was the property of one of the most powerful nobles in the kingdom, who had lived in it until the disturbances of the time forced him to flee, disguised in his cook's attire, and cross the border.</t4725> <t4726>Although in reality he was reduced to the condition of a game piece that managed to evade the attacks of the beaters and hunters, he was still the same lord, whose important operation of preparing chocolate and bringing it to his glorious lips required the efforts of three servants, apart from those of the cook.</t4726>
<t4727>The master had left; his servants absolved themselves of the horrendous sin of having received his wages by showing themselves perfectly willing to slit his throat on the brand-new altar of the One and Indivisible Republic, of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity or Death, and the master's sumptuous property was first seized and then confiscated.</t4727> <t4728>Things were done with such dizzying speed, and the decrees followed one another with such fierce haste, that by the third night of September, patriotic emissaries of the law had taken possession of the house in question, purified it by raising the tricolor flag over it, and were smoking and getting nicely drunk in its luxurious rooms.</t4728>
<t4729>If the Tellson House in London had resembled the Tellson House in Paris, the Londoners would surely have soon seen it listed among the bankrupt entities deserving to appear in the Gazette.</t4729> <t4730>What would the staunch English respectability have said if, in the lobby of a Bank, they had found abundant pots planted with orange trees and... horror! the figure of a Cupid presiding over the cash register?</t4730> <t4731>And yet, as inconceivable as it may seem, such was the case at the Tellson Bank in Paris.</t4731> <t4732>True, Tellson had whitewashed the Cupid on the wall with several coats of lime, but the one on the ceiling remained, scantily clad, gazing anxiously at the cash register (as it usually does) from dawn until nightfall.</t4732> <t4733>The most tremendous bankruptcy would have been the fatal and inevitable consequence of the presence of that pleasant pagan on Lombard Street in London, if it had not already been enough to cause it, a half-hidden alcove among rich curtains, in front of which stood the mischievous child, the immense mirror left on the wall, and the employees themselves, not as old as one would desire, who had no qualms about dancing in public with little encouragement.</t4733> <t4734>It is true that a French Tellson could afford all that and even more, without scandalizing anyone, without any capitalist even dreaming of withdrawing their capitals for such insignificant reasons.</t4734>
<t4735>How much money would henceforth come out of the coffers of the Tellson House in Paris, how much would remain there lost and forgotten, how much silver, how many jewels would lose their immaculate shine in the establishment's secret chambers, while their owners lost it in the dungeons or on the scaffold, how many current accounts of the Bank would remain unsettled in this world and pass to the next, is what no mortal could have said, what not even approximately managed to conjecture that night the very same Maurice Lorry, despite having repeated these questions hundreds of times.</t4735> <t4736>Sitting by the fireplace where some logs were crackling and burning (that barren and unproductive year had brought forward the cold season), his face, a reflection of honesty, showed shadows that were not cast by the hanging lamp from the ceiling nor by any of the objects in the room.</t4736>
<t4737>Lorry occupied rooms in the Bank building, to which his proven loyalty to the house, of which he was an integral part, gave him indisputable right.</t4737> <t4738>Many believed that the patriotic occupation of almost the entire building was a guarantee of security for the establishment, although the loyal Lorry never shared such a belief.</t4738> <t4739>Whatever happened in Paris was indifferent to him, for the only thing that aroused his interest was the fulfillment of his duty.</t4739> <t4740>At the back of the garden, under a roof supported by graceful columns, there was a coach house, in which some of the master's carriages remained.</t4740> <t4741>Attached to two columns were two lit torches, and at the base, placed in such a way as to receive their light, was a sharpening stone, mounted haphazardly, which had undoubtedly been brought from some nearby blacksmith or carpenter's shop.</t4741> <t4742>Lorry, who got up from his seat and looked out the window, withdrew with a shudder upon seeing that harmless object.</t4742>
<t4743>Even in the room where Lorry worked, the muffled murmur of the streets could be heard, occasionally joined by noises that seemed to come from a fantastical world, unheard-of noises so terrible that they rose from the earth to the sky.</t4743>
<t4744>—Thank God—said Lorry, clasping his hands,—I have no loved ones by my side on this dreadful night.</t4744> <t4745>May the Almighty look with compassionate eyes upon all those who are in danger!</t4745>
<t4746>He had barely spoken these words when the gate bell rang.</t4746>
<t4747>—No doubt they are coming back—thought Lorry.</t4747>
<t4748>He remained seated and listening; but as he did not hear the sound of footsteps in the vestibule, as he expected, nor the gate being closed again, vague fears regarding the Bank assailed good Lorry.</t4748> <t4749>He calmed himself, however, convinced that it was well guarded by men of absolute trust.</t4749> <t4750>He was about to resume his tasks when the door of his room suddenly opened and two people appeared on the threshold, at whose sight Lorry recoiled, seized by the most violent astonishment he had ever experienced in his life.</t4750>
<t4751>Lucía and her father; Lucía, who extended her hands to him with a pleading gesture and looked at him with an expression of someone who has their entire life concentrated in their eyes.</t4751>
<t4752>—Lucie... Manette!...</t4752> <t4753>What is this?—exclaimed Lorry, with indescribable astonishment—What is happening? What is going on? What brings you here?</t4753>
<t4754>Lucía, pale as a corpse, fell sobbing into the arms of the elderly friend from her childhood.</t4754>
<t4755>—Oh... dear friend!</t4755> <t4756>My husband...</t4756>
<t4757>—Your husband, Lucía?</t4757>
<t4758>—Carlos.</t4758>
<t4759>—What about Carlos?</t4759>
<t4760>—Here... in Paris.</t4760>
<t4761>—In Paris?</t4761>
<t4762>—He has been here for a few days... three or four... I don't know how many...</t4762> <t4763>It is impossible for me to put my thoughts in order...</t4763> <t4764>A generous idea, unknown to us, brought him here; he was detained at the barrier and taken to jail.</t4764>
<t4765>The old man let out a cry of fright.</t4765> <t4766>Almost at the same time, the gate bell rang and voices mixed with the sound of footsteps were heard in the garden.</t4766>
<t4767>—What noise is that?—asked the doctor, turning to the window.</t4767>
<t4768>—Don't look out!</t4768> <t4769>Don't look outside!...</t4769> <t4770>For heaven's sake, Manette, for your life... don't touch the blind!</t4770>
<t4771>The doctor turned, without removing his hand from the window latch, and with a cold and daring smile, he replied.</t4771>
<t4772>—My dear friend, in this city, my life is sacred.</t4772> <t4773>I have been a prisoner of the Bastille.</t4773> <t4774>There is not a patriot in Paris... what am I saying in Paris? in all of France!...</t4774> <t4775>There is not a patriot in all of France who, knowing that I have been a prisoner of the Bastille, would dare to touch me, except to crush me with hugs or to carry me in triumph through the streets.</t4775> <t4776>My past tortures have given me enough influence to get here without encountering obstacles at the barriers and to obtain news about Charles.</t4776> <t4777>I knew it would be so, I knew it would be easy for me to free Charles from the dangers that threaten him, and I assured Lucia of this...</t4777> <t4778>But what is that noise?—he finished, turning towards the window.</t4778>
<t4779>—Don't look!—shouted Lorry with a desperate tone—You neither, Lucia, my dear Lucia!—he added, wrapping his arm around her waist.</t4779><t4780>—But don't be afraid... don't be scared.</t4780> <t4781>I swear I don't know that anything bad has happened to Charles... I didn't even suspect that fate had brought him to this city.</t4781> <t4782>Which prison is he in?</t4782>
<t4783>—At the Force.</t4783>
<t4784>—La Force.</t4784> <t4785>If you have ever been brave, Lucía, my dear, if you have ever considered yourself strong enough to do something useful, today more than ever you must summon all your courage and all your effort to follow to the letter what I am going to tell you, because I assure you that much more depends on it than you can imagine, much more than I could tell you.</t4785> <t4786>What I am going to beg you to do for your Carlos is the hardest, the most difficult thing to conceive, because I am precisely going to ask you to calm down, to do nothing, to obey me, to allow me to take you to a secluded room in this house and to remain calm in it, leaving your father and me alone for a few minutes.</t4786> <t4787>For your dear Carlos, for the death that roams free in this unfortunate city today, I am sure you will obey me!</t4787>
<t4788>—I submissively obey your wishes, because I see in your face that I can neither do nor should do anything else, and that your words are inspired by my best interest.</t4788>
<t4789>Lorry kissed Lucía and immediately accompanied her to her room, where he left her, locking the door with a key as he exited.</t4789> <t4790>He hurried back to join the doctor, opened the window that faced the garden, placed his right hand on his friend's shoulder, and leaned out, indicating that his friend should do the same.</t4790>
<t4791>Before his eyes, there was a compact group of men and women, not many, that is, not enough, by far, to fill the garden, as there wouldn't be more than forty or fifty.</t4791> <t4792>The people who occupied the house had granted them entry so they could use the sharpening stone, installed there for public service, no doubt.</t4792>
<t4793>It seems that a sharpening stone should have nothing special about it, much less that it should attract sharpeners; but it chills the blood to think of those horrible sharpeners, both because of their appearance and the nature of their work, or rather, the objective of the work they performed.</t4793>
<t4794>Two men, whose faces were more horrible and cruel in expression than the fiercest savages when they display their most barbaric garments and paints, were turning the stone.</t4794> <t4795>False eyebrows and false mustaches adorned repugnant faces, all splattered with blood, faces contorted with rage and frenzy.</t4795> <t4796>While those heartless men turned the stone over and over, some women brought vessels full of wine to their lips.</t4796> <t4797>The scene could not have been more nauseating or more ferocious.</t4797> <t4798>Blood, wine, and fire were the constitutive elements of the scene; blood that covered the faces and hands of all the monsters present, wine that dripped from their fetid mouths, and fire that sparked brightly from the sharpening stone.</t4798> <t4799>Pushing and shoving each other in their eagerness to sharpen their instruments of slaughter as quickly as possible, there were men naked from the waist up, their arms, necks, faces, and bodies stained with blood; men covered in rags, with the rags stained with blood; men adorned with women's clothing, with lace, ribbons, and silks, and the silks, ribbons, and lace stained with blood.</t4799> <t4800>Axes, knives, bayonets, sabers, swords, all the instruments they were sharpening were stained with blood.</t4800> <t4801>Some carried swords or axes tied to their wrists with strips of cloth or pieces of dresses; the bindings varied, but not the color, all were red.</t4801>
<t4802>Lorry and the doctor recoiled as soon as their eyes met the repugnant scene.</t4802>
<t4803>—They are murdering the prisoners—said Lorry, answering the unspoken question that the doctor had just directed at him.</t4803><t4804>—If you are sure of what you say, if you really possess the influence you believe you have, and which I also believe you have, reveal yourself to those demons and have them take you to La Force.</t4804> <t4805>It may already be too late, who knows; but in any case, do not waste a single second.</t4805>
<t4806>Dr. Manette shook his friend's hand and, without saying a word, without even covering himself, went down to the garden.</t4806>
<t4807>Her hair white as snow, her face, which could not help but draw attention, the decisiveness with which she pushed away the weapons of that mob of monsters, opened the way for her to the center of the gathering, to the very sharpening stone.</t4807> <t4808>Lorry observed that everyone fell silent, that in the midst of a solemn silence the old man's voice rose vibrantly, that everyone listened attentively, that everyone looked at the speaker with the deepest respect; and after a few minutes, he saw that more than twenty men formed a compact group, surrounding the doctor and, enthroning him on their shoulders, they went out into the street shouting with delirious enthusiasm:</t4808>
<t4809>—Long live the prisoner of the Bastille!</t4809>
<t4810>—We want the relative of the one from the Bastille imprisoned in La Force!</t4810>
<t4811>—Make way for the prisoner of the Bastille!</t4811>
<t4812>—Freedom for the prisoner Evrémonde, confined in La Force!</t4812>
<t4813>Lorry closed the window very hopefully, and hurried to join Lucie, to whom he reported that her father, aided by the townspeople, had gone to look for her husband.</t4813> <t4814>With Lucie was her daughter and Miss Pross, but such was the confusion of good Lorry that he wasn't even surprised to find them there until much later.</t4814>
<t4815>The night was horrible.</t4815> <t4816>Lucía, in a state of stupor, was sitting on the floor wringing her hands, and Miss Pross, after putting the child to bed, succumbed to the sleep that besieged her and fell asleep with her head bent over the child's little bed.</t4816> <t4817>Horrible night, during which Lorry had to listen to the constant sobs of the unfortunate Lucía!</t4817> <t4818>Horrible night, eternal night, night of anguish, night of anxiety, night spent waiting for the arrival of a father who did not come, the arrival of news of a husband placed at the edge of the grave, and the news did not come!</t4818>
<t4819>Twice more the gate bell rang violently, twice more the intrusion was repeated, twice more they set the grindstone in motion.</t4819> <t4820>Lucía was frightened.</t4820>
<t4821>—What is that?—he asked.</t4821>
<t4822>—Silence!—responded Lorry.</t4822><t4823>—It is the soldiers sharpening their swords.</t4823> <t4824>The house is now national property, my dear.</t4824>
<t4825>The new day dawned.</t4825> <t4826>Lorry managed to free himself from Lucia's clenched hands and looked out the window.</t4826> <t4827>Next to the sharpening stone, a man, covered in blood from head to toe, resembling a wounded soldier regaining consciousness on the battlefield, was rising from the ground where he had been lying and looking around with a dazed expression.</t4827> <t4828>That killer, tired of killing, saw the lord's magnificent carriages, walked unsteadily to one of them, opened the door, and locked himself inside, ready to rest from the night's exertions on the plush cushions.</t4828>
<t4829>III.</t4829>
<t4830>THE SHADOW</t4830>
<t4831>One of the first reflections that Mr. Lorry's practical understanding suggested to him, as soon as the hour to commence the Bank's operations struck the next day, was that he had no right to create difficulties and attract dangers to Tellson's Bank by providing shelter in the building to the wife of an imprisoned emigrant.</t4831> <t4832>Without a second of hesitation, with joy, with all his soul, he would have sacrificed everything he possessed, including his freedom and his life, on the altar of the affection he felt for Lucie and her daughter; but the great banking establishment was not his, and when it came to business, Lorry was rigid, inflexible.</t4832>
<t4833>As a consequence of his musings, he thought of Defarge, and the thought was followed by the decision to go to the tavern and ask its owner to indicate a safe refuge for Lucie, if there was one in that troubled city, a refuge that could very well be, if Defarge agreed, the same garret where Dr. Manette had lived in the past.</t4833> <t4834>However, he dismissed this plan almost as soon as he conceived it, considering that the tavern was located in the most dangerous neighborhood of the city and that Defarge, undoubtedly an influential person among the inhabitants of that violent region, would be fully involved in the enterprises that were being forged and matured there.</t4834>
<t4835>As it was nearing twelve in the morning and the doctor had not yet appeared, with each passing minute increasing the predicament in which he had placed Tellson's Bank, Lorry decided to hold a consultation with Lucie.</t4835> <t4836>She mentioned that her father had spoken to her about renting a room in that very district, not far from the Bank.</t4836> <t4837>Seeing that the doctor's plan was not in opposition to the Bank's affairs, and foreseeing that even if Charles's situation was resolved favorably, and even if through the doctor's intervention and influence he was released, it would still be impossible for him to escape the city, Lorry immediately went out to find a suitable room and found one on an isolated street surrounded by uninhabited buildings.</t4837>
<t4838>Without losing a moment, he moved Lucía, her daughter, and Miss Pross to the mentioned room, giving them as much comfort as he could, which was more than he himself had.</t4838> <t4839>He left Jeremiah Lapa with them and went back to immerse himself in his tasks.</t4839>
<t4840>He spent the rest of the day sad, worried, and suspicious, until it was time to close the establishment.</t4840> <t4841>Then he retired to his room, as he had the day before, and was thinking about the resolutions he should adopt when he heard the sound of footsteps on the stairs.</t4841> <t4842>Seconds later, a man appeared before him who, looking at him with a penetrating gaze, addressed him by his name.</t4842>
<t4843>—At your service, Mr. Lorry.</t4843> <t4844>Do you know me?</t4844>
<t4845>He was an individual of solid build, with naturally curly black hair, and about forty-five years old.</t4845>
<t4846>—Do you know me?—he repeated.</t4846>
<t4847>—I have seen you somewhere.</t4847>
<t4848>—In my wine shop, perhaps?</t4848>
<t4849>More interested than ever, and not a little agitated, Lorry asked:</t4849>
<t4850>—Are you coming on behalf of Dr. Manette?</t4850>
<t4851>—Yes; I come on behalf of Doctor Manette.</t4851>
<t4852>—And what does it say? Is he sending me something?</t4852>
<t4853>Defarge placed in the eagerly outstretched hand of Lorry a piece of paper, which contained the following words, written in the doctor's own hand:</t4853>
<t4854>"Carlos is without news, but I cannot abandon the place where I am.</t4854> <t4855>I have managed to get the bearer of this to carry two lines from Carlos to his wife.</t4855> <t4856>Make sure the bearer meets with my daughter."</t4856>
<t4857>The letter was dated in La Force an hour earlier.</t4857>
<t4858>—Would you be so kind as to accompany me to the house where Carlos's wife resides?—asked Lorry, without hiding the joy that the reading of the note had produced in him.</t4858>
<t4859>—Yes—replied Defarge.</t4859>
<t4860>Without stopping, you lie in the reserved and curiously mechanical tone with which Defarge spoke, Lorry put on his hat and went down with his visitor to the garden, where they found two women, one of them knitting.</t4860>
<t4861>—Mrs. Defarge?—asked Lorry, who had left her occupied with the same thing seventeen years earlier.</t4861>
<t4862>—The same one—replied the husband.</t4862>
<t4863>—Is your wife coming with us?—asked Lorry, noticing that the women were starting to walk.</t4863>
<t4864>—Yes.</t4864> <t4865>He comes to recognize faces and get to know people.</t4865> <t4866>It's a measure that benefits the doctor's daughter.</t4866>
<t4867>Lorry, to whom Defarge's attitude and words began to seem strange, gave him a suspicious look and continued walking.</t4867> <t4868>The two women followed, one of whom was called The Vengeance.</t4868>
<t4869>They crossed the nearby streets as quickly as possible, climbed the stairs to Lucía's residence, Jeremías opened the door for them, and they found Carlos's wife alone and crying.</t4869> <t4870>The news about her husband that Lorry gave her filled her with joy, and she warmly shook the hand that handed her the brief words written by her Carlos... without thinking about what that hand had been doing the previous night very close to her husband's person, nor what it might have done with him had a fortunate coincidence not prevented it.</t4870>
<t4871>"Courage, my dear.</t4871> <t4872>I am well, and your father has influence over those around me.</t4872> <t4873>You cannot reply to me.</t4873> <t4874>Kiss our angel for me."</t4874>
<t4875>Nothing else was written on the note.</t4875> <t4876>It was, however, so much for the unfortunate woman who had just received it, that in her gratitude she turned to Madame Defarge and kissed with effusion the hands that were knitting.</t4876> <t4877>It was an act of a passionate, loving, grateful wife; but the hand that was the object of this act did not respond.</t4877> <t4878>It withdrew from her lips heavy, cold as ice, and continued knitting.</t4878>
<t4879>Lucía found something in that hand that shook her.</t4879> <t4880>At the very moment she brought her right hand to her chest to store the received note, her eyes, fixed on the face of the innkeeper, reflected infinite terror.</t4880> <t4881>Mrs. Defarge responded to her gaze with another that overflowed with impassivity, ice.</t4881>
<t4882>—My dear Lucía—said Lorry, trying to explain the presence of the women,—disturbances in the streets are very frequent, and although it is unlikely that anyone will bother you, Mrs. Defarge has come with the purpose of seeing the people whom she can extend her protection to, as it is convenient for her to know them well in order to be able to identify them at any given moment.</t4882> <t4883>I believe, citizen Defarge—he finished without daring to lavish further words of comfort,—that I have stated the truth of the matter, haven't I?</t4883>
<t4884>Defarge directed a somber look at his wife and limited himself to expressing his agreement with a grunt.</t4884>
<t4885>—I believe, Lucía, that it would be advisable for the girl and Miss Pross to leave—replied Lorry.</t4885><t4886>—Our excellent Pross, Defarge, is an English lady who does not understand French at all.</t4886>
<t4887>The lady in question, in whose chest the belief that she was more than capable of putting any foreigner in their place was deeply rooted, and who had not lost her peace of mind despite the disturbances and anarchy reigning in Paris, appeared with her arms crossed, and cast a quintessentially English look at La Venganza, whose eyes met hers from the very first moment.</t4887>
<t4888>—Hello, you cheeky thing!—he said in English.</t4888><t4889>—I'm glad to see you well.</t4889>
<t4890>He also directed one or two words to Mrs. Defarge; but neither she nor the other found it convenient to reply.</t4890>
<t4891>—Is that the girl?—asked Madame Defarge, pausing her work for the first time and pointing at Lucie with her knitting needle as if it were the finger of Fate.</t4891>
<t4892>—Yes, ma'am—replied Lorry.</t4892><t4893>—She is the beloved and only daughter of our poor prisoner.</t4893>
<t4894>The shadow that accompanied Madame Defarge and her companions took on such grim and threatening tones that the poor mother instinctively fell to her knees beside her daughter and held her tightly against her loving chest.</t4894> <t4895>The shadow that accompanied Madame Defarge and her companions then seemed to spread black and threatening over the mother and daughter.</t4895>
<t4896>—No more is needed—said the innkeeper.</t4896><t4897>—We have already seen them.</t4897> <t4898>Let's go.</t4898>
<t4899>Those words contained very veiled threats, yes, but not so much that maternal instinct could not penetrate them.</t4899> <t4900>This is why Lucía, extending her pleading arms towards Mrs. Defarge, said:</t4900>
<t4901>—Will they treat my poor husband kindly?</t4901> <t4902>They won't hurt him, will they?</t4902> <t4903>Will you make sure I can see him, if it's up to you?</t4903>
<t4904>—It is not your husband who has brought me here—replied Madame Defarge, looking at Lucie with terrifying calm.</t4904><t4905>—The only thing that interests me is the daughter of your father.</t4905>
<t4906>—For my sake, then, be compassionate with my husband... for me and for my poor little daughter!</t4906> <t4907>My daughter reaches out her little hands with me towards you and begs you not to close your hearts to the voice of pity!</t4907> <t4908>You inspire more fear in us than the whole city combined!</t4908>
<t4909>Defarge received this last phrase as a compliment and turned her eyes towards her husband.</t4909> <t4910>He, who was listening to Lucie while biting his thumbnail, hardened the expression on his face upon feeling his wife's gaze on him.</t4910>
<t4911>—What does your husband say in that little letter?—asked the innkeeper with a sarcastic smile.</t4911><t4912>—Doesn't he talk about influence?</t4912>
<t4913>—He says that my father enjoys some influence over those around him—replied Lucia, hastily taking the note from her chest, but with her eyes full of alarm fixed on her interlocutor and not on the paper.</t4913>
<t4914>—In that case, he will save her—observed the innkeeper;—we don't have to get involved.</t4914>
<t4915>—As a wife and as a mother—exclaimed Lucía with an expression of immense anxiety,—I implore your mercy and beg you on my knees not to use the power you possess against my husband, but in his favor.</t4915> <t4916>My sisters... my sisters!</t4916> <t4917>Remember that it is a wife and a mother who begs you!</t4917>
<t4918>Mrs. Defarge looked at the supplicant with her usual coldness, and said, turning her face towards The Vengeance:</t4918>
<t4919>—The wives and mothers whom we have been accustomed to see since we were born, or a little less, have been treated with great consideration, haven't they?</t4919> <t4920>Isn't it true that we have often seen their husbands and fathers buried in filthy dungeons?</t4920> <t4921>Since we came into the world, haven't we seen our sisters suffer, in their own persons and in those of their children, poverty, nakedness, hunger, thirst, diseases, miseries, oppressions, and all kinds of contempt?</t4921>
<t4922>—We never saw anything else—replied La Venganza.</t4922>
<t4923>—We have suffered all those things for a very, very long time—replied the innkeeper, addressing Lucía.</t4923><t4924>—Now tell me, judge for yourself; do you think it likely that the pain of a wife and the anxiety of a mother would affect us?</t4924>
<t4925>She continued knitting and went out.</t4925> <t4926>After her, Vengeance started walking, and Defarge was the last to leave, closing the door as he went out.</t4926>
<t4927>—Courage, my dear Lucía!—exclaimed Lorry, lifting her from the ground.</t4927><t4928>—Courage and more courage!</t4928> <t4929>So far everything is going well... much, much better than we could have promised ourselves.</t4929> <t4930>Lift up your heart, dear Lucía, and let us give thanks to Heaven!</t4930>
<t4931>—I do not lack a grateful heart nor do I cease to harbor hopes; but those horrible women are like black shadows that darken the sky of my hopes.</t4931>
<t4932>—Hush, hush!—exclaimed Lorry—What do you mean?</t4932> <t4933>Is it possible that such a brave little heart could feel dejection?</t4933> <t4934>Shadows!</t4934> <t4935>Shadows mean nothing, Lucie, they are insubstantial... nothing!</t4935>
<t4936>Despite his words, he himself also felt the influence, the oppression, of those fateful shadows, and although he did not admit it, the truth is that they worried and disturbed him greatly.</t4936>
<t4937>IV.</t4937>
<t4938>CALM IN THE STORM</t4938>
<t4939>The absence of Doctor Manette lasted four days.</t4939>
<t4940>With such diligence, they hid from Lucía most of the horrifying events that occurred during that period of time, that it was only much later, when she was already far from French territory, that she learned that eleven hundred defenseless prisoners, of both sexes and all ages, had been brutally murdered by a bloodthirsty mob, that for those four days and nights the horrors did not cease for even a second, that the streets of the city where she lived were flooded with blood, and that the atmosphere she breathed was saturated with blood fumes.</t4940> <t4941>The only news that reached her ears was that the mob had attacked the prisons, that all the political prisoners had been in serious danger, and that some had been dragged through the streets and murdered.</t4941>
<t4942>The doctor informed Mr. Lorry, not without demanding the utmost secrecy, that the mobs had forced him to witness brutal scenes of butchery and bloodshed in the prison of La Force; that there he had found a Tribunal in permanent session, before which the prisoners were presented one by one, who were immediately condemned to death and executed, or set free (very few), or else locked up again in their cells.</t4942> <t4943>He added that, having been presented to the Tribunal in question by the patriots who accompanied him, he stated his name and profession and made it known that, without prior accusation, and consequently without prior sentence, he had been a secret prisoner of the Bastille for eighteen years; and that one of the individuals who composed the Tribunal stood up and identified him, the individual in question turning out to be Defarge.</t4943>
<t4944>He said that from the records on the Tribunal's table, he could ascertain that his son-in-law was among the living prisoners, and that he defended him fervently before the Tribunal, some of whose members were snoring outrageously while others were awake, and among whom there were those stained with blood from head to toe and those clean of crimes (very few), some sober and others drunk (almost all), in honor of Liberty.</t4944> <t4945>That in the first moment of enthusiasm, consequent to the presence in that place of a man who had suffered so much, a martyr tortured by the overthrown situation, they granted that Charles appear immediately before that strange Tribunal and be examined.</t4945> <t4946>That when everything suggested they were going to decree his freedom, the decidedly favorable currents encountered obstacles, whose origin and nature were mysteries to the doctor, which led to a secret conference.</t4946> <t4947>That the person occupying the presidential chair then informed the doctor that the prisoner should remain confined, although, in consideration of the doctor's pleas, the prisoner's person would be inviolable.</t4947> <t4948>That immediately, at a signal from the president, the prisoner was taken back to his cell, but that he, the doctor, so insistently requested permission to stay there to ensure that his son-in-law, by mistake or malice, was not handed over to the mobs, whose ferocious howls deafened the judges, that he was granted the requested authorization, and that he did not move from the Hall of Blood until the final scene of the bloody drama concluded.</t4948>
<t4949>Impossible to detail all the brutalities, all the acts of fierce savagery that the doctor had to witness during those four days and nights.</t4949> <t4950>The mad joy with which the prisoners who obtained an acquittal indulged impressed him almost as much as the mad ferocity with which the mob tore apart those who were condemned.</t4950> <t4951>There was a prisoner whom the Tribunal declared acquitted and who, upon being freed onto the street, was struck by a spear by a monster, undoubtedly by mistake.</t4951> <t4952>Doctor Manette, who was asked to come out to treat the wounded man, immediately went out to the street and found him surrounded and attended to by countless compassionate Samaritans, all of them sitting on the corpses of their victims.</t4952> <t4953>Showing proof of an inconceivable inconsistency due to its monstrosity, they helped the doctor, attended to the wounded man with exemplary solicitude, improvised a stretcher and transported him... but once again plunging their murderous weapons into the corpses that filled the street and committing other brutalities so repugnant that the doctor had to cover his eyes with his hands, and even then he could not avoid fainting in the midst of those beasts.</t4953>
<t4954>Vivid fears assailed the good Lorry, while he listened to the dreadful story from the lips of his friend, whose age was already nearing sixty-two years, that the horrifying scenes he had witnessed might breathe new life into the ancient danger.</t4954> <t4955>Perhaps he was mistaken, however, and the cause of his mistake was the fact that he had never seen his friend under the aspect and character in which he then saw him.</t4955> <t4956>For the first time in his life, the doctor understood that his past sufferings were a source of energy and influence for him; for the first time he felt that in that fiery forge he was slowly shaping the irons that would break down the doors of the prison in which his daughter's husband was confined and grant him freedom.</t4956>
<t4957>—In the midst of it all, it was a blessing, my friend; not everything has been calamities and ruins.</t4957> <t4958>Just as my idolized daughter did everything humanly possible to help me recover the health of my body and soul, I will not rest until I return to her what constitutes the most cherished part of herself.</t4958> <t4959>With Heaven's help, I will do it!</t4959>
<t4960>Such were the words spoken by Dr. Manette, once he had finished presenting the facts.</t4960> <t4961>And when Maurice Lorry saw the fire of enthusiasm spark in his eyes, and when he noticed the calm serenity of that man, whose life, paralyzed for several years, was once again brimming with energy, he opened his heart to hope, and believed.</t4961>
<t4962>Obstacles much greater than those that stood before the doctor would have yielded to a perseverance as indomitable as his.</t4962> <t4963>Without exceeding the boundaries of his profession as a doctor, whose mission is to interact with all classes and social conditions, both with prisoners and those who enjoy freedom, with the rich as well as the poor, without distinction of oppressors and oppressed, good and bad, wise and ignorant, he knew how to employ his influence with such sagacity that he was soon appointed medical inspector of the prisons, and consequently, of La Force.</t4963> <t4964>He was able to assure Lucie that her husband was no longer kept alone in an isolated cell, but mixed with the general population of prisoners; he could visit his daughter's husband once a week and convey messages from him to her; he managed to ensure that Lucie received some letters from her husband, although never through the doctor himself, but he did not allow her to send letters to Charles, for among all the emigrants suffering in the prisons, none aroused as much suspicion among the populace as those known to have relatives outside.</t4964>
<t4965>There is no doubt that this new phase in the doctor's life brought with it countless anxieties, but Lorry, who was not lacking in shrewdness, understood from the very beginning that these anxieties were accompanied by a certain pride that acted as a powerful support for him.</t4965> <t4966>There was nothing inconvenient about this pride; on the contrary, it was a natural and dignified pride.</t4966> <t4967>However, Lorry observed it as a curiosity worthy of study.</t4967> <t4968>The doctor knew that until then, both his daughter and his friend had attributed his personal affliction, his weakness, his exhaustion to his long years of confinement.</t4968> <t4969>But the circumstances had changed radically; and convinced that his past tortures had endowed him with strengths that he could put at the service of Charles's cause, strengths that, if well employed, could result in the freedom of his daughter's husband, he became so exalted that he took charge of the matter and accepted the others as secondary cooperators, as one who considers himself strong accepts the help of others whom he deems weak.</t4969> <t4970>The respective positions of the doctor and his daughter were reversed, though only in ways that could be reversed without diminishing the tenderest affection and the most profound love, for the father took all his pride in rendering some service to the one who had rendered him such immense services.</t4970>
<t4971>—The phenomenon is very curious—thought Lorry;—but very natural and very noble.</t4971> <t4972>So, take the leadership, my dear friend, take charge of the direction and keep it: it cannot be in better hands.</t4972>
<t4973>The doctor worked hard to get his son-in-law released, or at least to have him appear before the Tribunal that would decide his fate, but he could not overcome the overwhelming currents that had been unleashed at that time.</t4973> <t4974>A new era had dawned, the King had been sentenced, condemned, and beheaded; the Republic of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death had declared that it would conquer the world risen in arms against it or perish; the black flag waved day and night atop the towers of Notre Dame; three hundred thousand men, summoned by the powerful call to fight the tyrants of the earth, sprang from the various provinces of France, as if the teeth of the fierce dragon, sown in flight, had sprouted and flourished equally in the mountains and the plains, in the rocks and the gravel, in the dry lands and the marshes, under the beautiful southern sky and the misty northern one, in the wastelands and the forests, in the vineyards and the olive groves, among the wheat and the grasses, in the beautiful valleys bathed by rivers and on the sandy beaches kissed by the sea.</t4974> <t4975>What particular effort, no matter how immense, could fight against the deluge of the Year One of Liberty... a deluge that sprang from below instead of coming from the clouds, a deluge that flooded France while the gates of the heavens remained closed?</t4975>
<t4976>The French soil had been stripped of pause, piety, compassion, peace, rest, tranquility, and the measurement of time.</t4976> <t4977>Days and nights followed one another as always, it is true; night was followed by morning and a new day began, but the reckoning of time went no further, for its perception had been lost in the devouring fever of a nation, just as it is lost by an individual in their personal fever.</t4977> <t4978>Today, the supernatural silence of an entire city was interrupted by the executioner, showing the people the head of the King, and another day he presented the head of a Queen famous for her beauty, who needed no more than eight months of widowhood and misery for her hair to turn from blonde to snow-white.</t4978>
<t4979>However, once again fulfilling the strange law of contradictions, time, despite flying with dizzying speed, seemed to drag on with exasperating slowness.</t4979> <t4980>A revolutionary tribunal in the capital and forty-five thousand revolutionary committees operating in the nation; a Law of Suspects that swept away the guarantees upon which freedom and life rest and handed over every good or innocent person into the hands of any wicked individual, any criminal; prisons crowded with people who had committed no offense and for whom all paths that could lead to their justification were closed, such were the principles upon which the established social order rested, principles that seemed of ancient use within a few weeks of being implemented.</t4980> <t4981>Above all, a fateful figure stood out that with brutal speed became as familiar to the French as if it had existed before the foundations of the world; the figure of the wife called Guillotine.</t4981>
<t4982>The town had turned her into an inexhaustible source of jokes.</t4982> <t4983>She was the most effective remedy for curing headaches, the most infallible preventive against gray hair and baldness, gave the skin a special delicacy, was the National Barber Razor that shaved best, the one who was lucky enough to kiss the Guillotine, looked through a little hole and sneezed into a basket; she was the sign of the regeneration of the human race and had eclipsed the Cross.</t4983> <t4984>Many throats that once wore little crosses now displayed guillotine charms, and there were countless people who never believed in the Cross and yet believed in the Guillotine and prostrated themselves before her.</t4984>
<t4985>So many heads did it sever that both the fierce apparatus and the ground it dishonored oozed with blood.</t4985> <t4986>Made of several detachable pieces, like puzzles, it was assembled every time it had to be put into action.</t4986> <t4987>It was a device whose main mission was to silence eloquence, humiliate the powerful, and put an end to beauty and goodness.</t4987> <t4988>In one morning, and in twenty-two minutes, it had sliced off twenty-two heads of as many friends of the public good, twenty-one of them alive, and one dead before ascending the fatal platform.</t4988> <t4989>The public official in charge of operating it had inherited the name of that prodigy of strength mentioned in the Old Testament; but the French Samson, armed with the Guillotine, was much stronger and more robust than his Israelite namesake, and more blind and brutish, for every day and at all hours he tore down the doors of the very Temple of God.</t4989>
<t4990>The doctor Manette walked among these horrors and among the rabble that produced them with a steady head, full of confidence in his power, always aiming for the goal he had set for himself, albeit cautiously, and without questioning that the result of his efforts would ultimately be the freedom of Lucie's husband.</t4990> <t4991>However, the current of time was so impetuous, the waters so deep, it flew with such tremendous fury, that Charles continued rotting in prison fifteen months after entering it without the robust confidence of the doctor being shaken.</t4991> <t4992>During the month of December, the Revolution raged in such a way in its furies that the rivers of the South could barely run through their spacious channels, filled with heaps of corpses of those who were violently drowned in their waters during the night.</t4992> <t4993>The prisoners were shot by dozens, by hundreds, by thousands; but the doctor continued advancing among so many horrors with a firm step and a solid head.</t4993> <t4994>In Paris, there was no man more known than him nor one in a stranger situation.</t4994> <t4995>Silent, humane, indispensable in hospitals and prisons, providing the aid of science to both murderers and victims, it can be said that he was a man apart.</t4995> <t4996>In the exercise of his profession, the captive of the Bastille was the idol of the people.</t4996> <t4997>More than a man, he seemed like a Spirit moving among mortals.</t4997>
<t4998>V.</t4998>
<t4999>THE SAWMILLER</t4999>
<t5000>One year and three months.</t5000> <t5001>Lucía did not enjoy a minute of tranquility during all that time, as she could never be sure that her husband's head would not roll the next day.</t5001> <t5002>At all hours, carts of Death filled with the condemned rumbled over the cobblestones of the streets.</t5002> <t5003>Lovely young girls, ladies in the prime of their beauty, heads with black hair, brown hair, blonde hair, white hair; robust young men, full of life, and old men bent under the weight of the years, gentlemen and laborers, ladies and peasant women, all provided red wine to the Guillotine, daily emerging from the dark caves of their filthy dungeons and being led in an endless procession through the streets to quench its devouring thirst.</t5003> <t5004>Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death...</t5004> <t5005>You have yielded more fruits of Death than of Liberty, Equality, or Fraternity, oh Guillotine!</t5005>
<t5006>If the abrupt and unexpected nature of her calamities and the dizzying roll of the wheels of time had stunned the doctor's daughter, plunging her into that state of idle despair, they surely would have sent her to the grave or the asylum, as they have with less reason sent so many others. But from the moment she pressed that snow-haired head against her youthful chest in the attic of the tavern in the San Antonio neighborhood, she had dedicated herself to the strict fulfillment of her duties, and she fulfilled them with as much self-sacrifice in days of trial as in those of calm and happiness.</t5006>
<t5007>No sooner had they settled into their new residence, and as soon as her father fully engaged in his profession, Lucía arranged her modest home exactly as if she had her husband by her side.</t5007> <t5008>The order in that house was perfect.</t5008> <t5009>Lucita gave her lessons with the same regularity as in her London home.</t5009> <t5010>The innocent artifices with which the desolate wife tried to deceive herself, instilling in her heart the belief that she would soon have the joy of embracing her husband, the daily preparations for departure she made...</t5010> <t5011>along with the solemn prayers she directed to Heaven every night in favor of a special prisoner, in favor of a particular unfortunate among the many who groaned in the gloomy antechambers of death, were the only consolations for her troubled soul.</t5011>
<t5012>Her outward appearance changed very little.</t5012> <t5013>Her simple black dress, very similar to mourning crepe, as well as her daughter's dress, black like hers, reflected as much cleanliness and care as those she wore in her happiest days.</t5013> <t5014>She lost the freshness of her face, constantly sad and downcast, but her beauty and grace did not diminish at all.</t5014> <t5015>Sometimes, at night, at the moment of kissing her father, the tears stored in her chest during the endless hours of the day sought an outlet through her eyes, and it could be said that this was her only comfort on earth.</t5015> <t5016>The doctor invariably answered with determination:</t5016>
<t5017>—Nothing can happen to him without my knowing, and I know that I can save him, my daughter.</t5017>
<t5018>Not many weeks had passed, when one night, upon returning home, her father said to her:</t5018>
<t5019>—Look, dear; at the very top of the prison building, there is a window, which Carlos can sometimes reach at three in the afternoon.</t5019> <t5020>When he manages to do so, which depends on occasional circumstances and incidents, and consequently is uncertain, he believes he could see you if you were in a specific spot on the street that I will indicate to you.</t5020> <t5021>On the other hand, you, my poor daughter, will not be able to see him, and even if you could, it would be dangerous for you to make the slightest signal of recognition.</t5021>
<t5022>—Oh my father!</t5022> <t5023>Show me the place, and I will be there every day.</t5023>
<t5024>From that night on, Lucía, every day, whether good or bad, sunny or rainy, hot or cold, spent two hours in the place her father had indicated.</t5024> <t5025>She was there at the moment when the city clocks struck two, and she remained there until four, the hour at which she would leave with saintly resignation.</t5025> <t5026>When the weather was not excessively bad, she would take Lucita with her; otherwise, she went alone; but she did not miss a single day.</t5026>
<t5027>The waiting place was a dark and dirty spot in a narrow and winding alley.</t5027> <t5028>There was nothing in it except for a house inhabited by a man who dedicated himself to sawing logs for firewood; everything else in the street was a wall corresponding to buildings that had their entrance from another parallel street.</t5028>
<t5029>On the third day that Lucía went to the place indicated by her father, the sawyer saw her.</t5029>
<t5030>—Good afternoon, citizen.</t5030>
<t5031>—Good afternoon, citizen.</t5031>
<t5032>It was the prescribed greeting, nothing less than by a decree.</t5032> <t5033>It had been implemented some time before by the most fervent patriots, but by the time we refer to, it was mandatory for everyone.</t5033>
<t5034>—Taking a walk around here, citizen?</t5034>
<t5035>—You are already seeing it, citizen.</t5035>
<t5036>The sawyer, who in earlier times had been a road worker, raised his eyes, extended his arm in the direction of the prison, brought both hands to his face placing his fingers in a way that represented bars, looked through them, and let out a significant laugh.</t5036>
<t5037>—It's not my business—he said,—and continued sawing.</t5037>
<t5038>The next day, it seemed that the sawyer was waiting for Lucía, as he approached her as soon as she appeared in the alley.</t5038>
<t5039>—Out for a walk here again, citizen?</t5039>
<t5040>—Yes, citizen.</t5040>
<t5041>—Ah! And with a little girl?</t5041> <t5042>Your mom, little citizen, isn't that right?</t5042>
<t5043>—Should I say yes, mom?—asked the girl in a low voice, approaching her mother.</t5043>
<t5044>—Yes, dear, yes.</t5044>
<t5045>—Yes, citizen—replied Lucita.</t5045>
<t5046>—Ah! It's not my business.</t5046> <t5047>The only thing that interests me is working...</t5047> <t5048>Look at my saw, citizen...</t5048> <t5049>I call it my dear Guillotine...</t5049> <t5050>La, la, la, la, la... and a head falls.</t5050>
<t5051>Indeed; while he was speaking, the piece of wood fell, and the sawyer put it into a basket.</t5051>
<t5052>—I give myself the name of Samson, the Fuel Guillotine.</t5052> <t5053>I handle my device, and a head falls...</t5053> <t5054>Now a woman's head falls... are you watching, citizen?</t5054> <t5055>It's the girl's turn... whack! Goodbye, little head!</t5055> <t5056>I finished with the whole family.</t5056>
<t5057>Lucía found it repugnant to watch the logs being sawed and could not see the act of placing them in the basket without feeling a shudder, but it was impossible for her to stay in that place during the sawyer's working hours without him seeing her.</t5057> <t5058>Henceforth, in order to win his sympathies, not only did she take the initiative to speak to him, but she also gave him some coins for a drink, which he accepted without hesitation.</t5058>
<t5059>The sawyer was an extremely curious individual.</t5059> <t5060>Many times, when Lucía, forgetting his presence, would remain for a long time with her gaze fixed on the prison bars and her heart set on her husband, upon realizing her imprudence, she would lower her gaze and see the sawyer looking at her with a smile, his knee on the bench and holding the saw, but not working.</t5060> <t5061>When this happened, as a general rule, he would say, "it's none of my business," and resume his work without further comment.</t5061>
<t5062>At all times, whether during the snows and ice of winter or enduring the furious gales of spring, whether under the scorching summer sun or the torrential autumn rains, not a single day did Lucía fail to spend two hours in that place, not a single day did she fail to kiss, upon leaving, the walls of the prison.</t5062> <t5063>Her husband saw her (Lucía knew this through her father) once for every five or six times she went out, sometimes two or three consecutive days, although it also happened that he was deprived of that joy for an entire week.</t5063> <t5064>Lucía was satisfied with him seeing her as many times as he had the opportunity to reach the window, and in exchange for not disappointing him even once, she would have gone out not for a day, not for a week; but for entire years.</t5064>
<t5065>December arrived.</t5065> <t5066>Her father continued walking among dreadful horrors, always with a firm step, always with a solid head.</t5066> <t5067>One cold and rainy afternoon, Lucía arrived at the usual little corner.</t5067> <t5068>It was a day of general rejoicing.</t5068> <t5069>She had seen the houses adorned with an abundance of hats pierced by small spears, and decorated with tricolor ribbons and with the inscription, also tricolor (tricolor letters were very fashionable): "One and Indivisible Republic.</t5069> <t5070>Liberty, Equality, Fraternity or Death."</t5070>
<t5071>So miserable and cramped was the sawyer's workshop that its entire surface was almost insufficient for the copied inscription.</t5071> <t5072>The house was topped with its corresponding spear equipped with its indispensable red cap, as befitted any citizen who considered himself good, and in a window, he had placed his saw, under which the following inscription could be read: "The Holy Guillotine."</t5072> <t5073>The workshop was closed, the sawyer was absent, and Lucía could savor the pleasure of being completely alone.</t5073>
<t5074>However, the sawyer was not very far away.</t5074> <t5075>Lucía's wait lasted only a few minutes when loud shouts echoed in the street, filling her with terror.</t5075> <t5076>Seconds later, compact crowds turned the corner of the prison, with the sawyer in the center holding hands with La Venganza.</t5076> <t5077>There would be no fewer than five hundred people, dancing as if they were five hundred thousand demons.</t5077> <t5078>Nor did they have music, for their devilish dances were sufficiently accompanied by the hoarse and discordant shouting from their throats.</t5078> <t5079>They sang the popular hymn of the Revolution, accompanied by a fierce clashing of teeth.</t5079> <t5080>They danced a fierce dance, which we will not describe, for it suffices to say that the prevailing savagery had turned an innocent distraction into an effective means of igniting the blood, dulling the senses, and hardening the heart.</t5080>
<t5081>It was the Carmagnole.</t5081> <t5082>Lucía, horrified, frozen with fear, had taken refuge in the doorway of the sawyer, covering her face with her hands.</t5082>
<t5083>—Oh my father!—she exclaimed as she separated her hands and unexpectedly found herself facing the doctor.</t5083><t5084>—What a cruel, so repugnant spectacle!</t5084>
<t5085>—I know, my dear, I know.</t5085> <t5086>I have witnessed it many times.</t5086> <t5087>Don't be afraid, no one will harm you in the slightest.</t5087>
<t5088>—I am not afraid for myself, my father; but when I think of my husband and the outbursts of those people...</t5088>
<t5089>—Soon we will protect you from his outbursts.</t5089> <t5090>I left him climbing to the window and came to tell you.</t5090> <t5091>Since today there is no one around here who can see you, it doesn't matter if you send a kiss with your hand to the highest part of the roof, to the very eaves.</t5091>
<t5092>—I will send it, my father, and with the kiss, I will send my entire soul.</t5092>
<t5093>—You can't see him, my poor daughter; can you?</t5093>
<t5094>—No, my father, I can't—replied Lucía, crying.</t5094>
<t5095>Some footsteps were heard, and Madame Defarge appeared.</t5095>
<t5096>—Greetings, citizen—said the doctor.</t5096>
<t5097>—Greetings, citizen—replied the innkeeper, continuing on her way without stopping.</t5097>
<t5098>—Give me your arm, my dear.</t5098> <t5099>Leave here, but pretend to be cheerful, even though I know you cannot feel it...</t5099> <t5100>That's it, very good.</t5100> <t5101>Tomorrow, Carlos will appear before his judges.</t5101>
<t5102>—Tomorrow!</t5102>
<t5103>—We cannot waste time.</t5103> <t5104>I have everything admirably arranged, but there is a need to take precautions that cannot be finalized until the very moment Carlos appears before the Tribunal.</t5104> <t5105>He has not yet received the summons, but I know for a fact that he will be summoned for tomorrow and that he will be transferred to the Consulate.</t5105> <t5106>As you can see, I receive the news in a timely manner.</t5106> <t5107>I suppose you won't be scared, right?</t5107>
<t5108>The unfortunate woman could barely stammer.</t5108>
<t5109>—I trust you.</t5109>
<t5110>—You can trust, in the certainty of not being disappointed.</t5110> <t5111>Your agonies are coming to an end, my love.</t5111> <t5112>Within a few hours, you will have him in your arms.</t5112> <t5113>I have surrounded him with all imaginable protections.</t5113> <t5114>I need to see Lorry...</t5114>
<t5115>The doctor was interrupted.</t5115> <t5116>In the nearby street, there was a heavy noise of carts.</t5116> <t5117>One... two... three...</t5117> <t5118>Three carts loaded with condemned men being taken to their execution.</t5118>
<t5119>—I need to see Lorry—repeated the doctor, turning his head to the other side to avoid seeing the funeral procession.</t5119>
<t5120>The good Lorry remained motionless in the Bank building.</t5120> <t5121>Both he and the books were frequently requisitioned as confiscated property and converted into national assets, which did not prevent him from saving as much as possible through sheer determination and self-sacrifice.</t5121>
<t5122>It was getting dark when the father and daughter arrived at the Bank.</t5122> <t5123>The sumptuous residence of the gentleman remained deserted.</t5123> <t5124>On the garden gate there was an inscription that read: "National Property.</t5124> <t5125>One and Indivisible Republic.</t5125> <t5126>Liberty, Equality, Fraternity or Death."</t5126>
<t5127>What had become of Mr. Lorry, who was not in his office?</t5127> <t5128>Whom had he just dismissed when he came out, agitated and surprised, to embrace his beloved little friend?</t5128> <t5129>To whom did he repeat the words that had just been addressed to him in a faltering voice, saying from the door he was crossing: "Transferred to the Conciergerie and summoned for tomorrow?"</t5129>
<t5130>VI.</t5130>
<t5131>TRIUMPH</t5131>
<t5132>Without exaggeration, it can be said that the formidable Tribunal of the Five not only operated every day but was also in permanent session.</t5132> <t5133>The lists of prisoners who were to appear before the Tribunal the following day were delivered every afternoon to the wardens of the prisons, who, in turn, read them to those concerned.</t5133> <t5134>In prison jargon, these lists were called "Nightly Journals."</t5134>
<t5135>"Carlos Evrémonde, alias Darnay."</t5135>
<t5136>Such was the name that headed the "Evening Journal" corresponding to La Force.</t5136>
<t5137>As soon as the name was pronounced, the interested party separated from the group of his unfortunate companions and took his place in the spot designated for those called.</t5137> <t5138>Since Charles Darnay had witnessed that scene hundreds of times, it goes without saying that he had plenty of reasons to be familiar with the custom.</t5138>
<t5139>The chubby warden gave him a look through the dirty lenses of his spectacles, without which he could not read, to make sure he had moved to the place he was supposed to occupy, and having confirmed this, he continued reading the list, making a similar pause after each name.</t5139> <t5140>Twenty-three were named, but since one of them had died in jail, and the Holy Guillotine had beheaded two others, although no one remembered them, only twenty answered the call.</t5140> <t5141>The list was read in the same vaulted room where Charles found so many prisoners gathered the night he entered the jail.</t5141> <t5142>All of them had been torn apart by the mobs on the day of the general massacre, and those who entered later left again to take their passage to the other world on the scaffold.</t5142>
<t5143>Some farewell and encouraging phrases were exchanged between those who were leaving and those who were staying, not many, as aside from being an incident that repeated every day, the society of La Force had planned for that night the celebration of some games, and they needed to make the most of the time to finalize the program.</t5143> <t5144>Those who stayed accompanied those who were leaving to the exit gate of the room, shed some tears, and turned back, as it was necessary to fill the twenty gaps left vacant by the absentees if they did not want to forgo the evening's entertainments, and this had to be done before the hour of silence, when the establishment's vigilance was entrusted to armies of ferocious mastiffs that filled the corridors and adjoining rooms.</t5144> <t5145>And it is not that the prisoners were insensitive or hard-hearted; but in their character, in their way of being, the condition of the era inevitably had an influence.</t5145> <t5146>Just as those saw their unfortunate companions leave almost impassively, there were many who, intoxicated, undoubtedly yielding to a kind of fervor that is barely understood today but was very natural at that time, challenged the people without any need and spontaneously ran in search of the caresses of the guillotine, without their act being influenced much or little by boastfulness, but by the general infection consequent to the brutal shaking of the public soul.</t5146> <t5147>In times of pestilence, one sees people who are mysteriously attracted to the contagion, people who would wish to die from it.</t5147> <t5148>And it is that we all carry within the depths of our souls dormant oddities that need only the concurrence of certain circumstances to awaken.</t5148>
<t5149>Short and dark was the passage from La Force to the Conciergerie, long and cold the nights spent in the pestilential cells of the latter.</t5149> <t5150>Fifteen prisoners appeared before the Tribunal the next morning, before Charles Darnay was called to appear.</t5150> <t5151>The hearings of the fifteen lasted an hour and a half, and all fifteen were condemned to death.</t5151>
<t5152>“Charles Evrémonde, alias Darnay,” they finally called.</t5152>
<t5153>The judges wore hats adorned with feathers, but aside from them, the entire audience wore red woolen caps with their corresponding tricolor cockades.</t5153> <t5154>A mere glance at the Tribunal was enough to suspect that the natural order of things had been inverted and that criminals were judging honorable men.</t5154> <t5155>The sentences were inspired by the vilest, most cruel, most criminal mob in the city, and they inspired them by injecting immense amounts of baseness, cruelty, and wickedness into their inspirations, sometimes commenting loudly, sometimes applauding, sometimes anticipating and precipitating the outcome of the deliberations.</t5155> <t5156>All the men filling the room were armed to the teeth; all the women carried knives and daggers, some were eating, others drinking, others knitting.</t5156> <t5157>Among the latter, there was one who stood out for her industriousness.</t5157> <t5158>She was seated in one of the front rows next to a man whom Charles had not seen since the day he arrived at the Barrier of Paris, but who reminded him of Defarge.</t5158> <t5159>He observed that the woman spoke two or three times in a very low voice to her neighbor, which led him to suppose that she was his wife, but what most powerfully caught his attention was that despite being as close as possible to him, they did not look at him even once.</t5159> <t5160>They frequently turned their eyes to the judges, as if expecting something, but nothing more.</t5160> <t5161>Near the President of the Tribunal sat Doctor Manette, calm as always and dressed as always.</t5161> <t5162>The prisoner noticed that only the doctor and Mr. Lorry, seated next to him, were dressed as usual and did not display the coarse attire of the Carmagnole.</t5162>
<t5163>Carlos Evrémonde, also called Darnay, was accused by the public prosecutor of being an emigrant whose life was forfeit to the Republic according to the decree that proscribed all emigrants under penalty of death.</t5163> <t5164>The fact that the decree in question had been promulgated when the accused was already in France was a trivial circumstance that did not deserve consideration.</t5164> <t5165>The decree existed, they had the accused in front of them who had been arrested within the borders of France, and the Republic demanded his head.</t5165>
<t5166>—Let his head roll!—roared the crowd—Death to that enemy of the Republic!</t5166>
<t5167>The President rang the bell to silence those shouts and asked the accused if it was not true that he had resided in England for many years.</t5167>
<t5168>Darnay answered affirmatively.</t5168>
<t5169>—And you say you're not an emigrant?</t5169> <t5170>What name do you give yourself, then?</t5170>
<t5171>—I do not consider myself an emigrant according to the letter and spirit of the law.</t5171>
<t5172>—Why not?</t5172> <t5173>That is what I wish to know.</t5173>
<t5174>—Because I freely and willingly renounced a title that was not to my liking and a social position that displeased me, and I left my homeland to live off my work in England rather than off rents collected from the people of France, burdened under the weight of so many taxes and levies.</t5174>
<t5175>—How do you prove the accuracy of your statements?</t5175>
<t5176>—With the testimony of Théophile Gabelle and Alexandre Manette.</t5176>
<t5177>—But you got married in England—objected the President.</t5177>
<t5178>—True; but not with an English woman.</t5178>
<t5179>—With a citizen of France?</t5179>
<t5180>—Yes.</t5180>
<t5181>—Your last name and family?</t5181>
<t5182>—Lucie Manette, only daughter of Doctor Manette, the excellent physician present here.</t5182>
<t5183>This response produced an effect in the audience that is impossible to describe with words.</t5183> <t5184>The hall trembled under the cries of delirious enthusiasm that the mere mention of Doctor Manette's name elicited.</t5184> <t5185>So capricious were the movements of the people that many eyes, which a second before had been watching the accused with ferocity as if their impatience to have him delivered to them to tear him apart was overflowing, immediately filled with tears.</t5185>
<t5186>Carlos Darnay, in his statements, had followed the doctor's instructions to the letter.</t5186>
<t5187>—Why did the accused return to France when he did, and not earlier?—asked the President.</t5187>
<t5188>—I did not return earlier—answered Carlos—simply because in France I had no other means of livelihood than the assets I had renounced, whereas in England I earned enough for my subsistence by giving lessons in French and French literature.</t5188> <t5189>If I returned when I did, it was in response to a written plea from a French citizen, who informed me that my absence was very seriously compromising his life.</t5189> <t5190>I returned to save the life of the citizen in question, and to declare the truth without regard to dangers or inconveniences.</t5190> <t5191>What crime does the Republic see in this?</t5191>
<t5192>The mob shouted, drunk with enthusiasm:</t5192>
<t5193>—None... none!</t5193>
<t5194>The President rang the bell, but he could not impose silence until the audience grew tired of shouting.</t5194>
<t5195>—What was the name of the citizen to whom the defendant refers?—asked the President.</t5195>
<t5196>—Teófilo Gabelle, present here.</t5196> <t5197>The letter I have mentioned, which, although it was taken from me at the Barrier, I have no doubt will be among the documents the President has on the table, confirms my statements.</t5197>
<t5198>The doctor had taken good care to ensure that the letter in question was on the table.</t5198> <t5199>The President found it effortlessly and read it aloud.</t5199> <t5200>Next, Gabelle was called to confirm the statements of the accused and to declare himself the author of the letter, which he did with great precision and a tone of truth.</t5200> <t5201>Citizen Gabelle delicately and tactfully suggested that the Tribunal, short on time due to the countless enemies of the Republic demanding all its attention, had left him in the Abbey prison until three days prior, an insignificant and very natural oversight; and that, when he appeared before the Tribunal, he was declared innocent and set free, having satisfactorily dispelled the accusations against him.</t5201>
<t5202>The next person to be questioned was Dr. Manette.</t5202> <t5203>His great personal popularity and the clarity and precision of his answers created an indescribable impression on the audience; but when he demonstrated that the accused was the one who most effectively contributed to freeing him from his eternal captivity, when he stated that the accused remained in England, surrounding not only his daughter but also himself with tender care and devoted affection, affection and care that made their exile sweet, when he added that far from being a supporter and defender of the aristocratic government of the country where he lived, he was prosecuted and almost condemned to death as an enemy of England and a friend of the United States.</t5203> <t5204>After he made a clear and eloquent exposition of all these circumstances, the Tribunal and the audience identified with him.</t5204> <t5205>So much so, that when he invoked the testimony of Mr. Lorry, an English gentleman present there, a witness, like him, of the trial held in England against Darnay, and ready to corroborate all his statements, the judges replied that they were satisfied with what they had heard, and that they would gladly vote if the President was willing to receive the votes.</t5205>
<t5206>As the judges voted (doing so individually and aloud), the audience burst into frenzied applause.</t5206> <t5207>Unanimously, they declared the prisoner innocent, and as a result, the President declared him free.</t5207>
<t5208>Then followed one of those extraordinary scenes that highlight the fickleness of the mob, or the impulses towards generosity and pity, dormant in the depths of their soul, or what they consider to be a demonstration that they are not carried away by the explosive force of cruel rage.</t5208> <t5209>It is impossible to determine which of these three motives decisively influenced the extraordinary scenes that followed; probably all three influenced, with the second one predominating.</t5209> <t5210>The fact is that, as soon as the acquittal was pronounced, tears flowed as abundantly as blood had on other occasions, and the prisoner received so many and such tight embraces from everyone, regardless of gender, that he was in real danger of his prolonged captivity ending in a full-blown suffocation; it is noteworthy that these embraces were given by the same people who, driven by a different current, would have pounced on him with the same intensity to tear him apart with their nails and drag his palpitating remains through the streets.</t5210>
<t5211>Thanks to having to leave the room to make way for other defendants awaiting sentencing, he was able to escape for the moment from that overwhelming torrent of caresses.</t5211>
<t5212>Next, five accused individuals appeared together, who were charged with being enemies of the Republic, not because they had worked against it, but because they had done nothing, neither in word nor deed, in its favor.</t5212> <t5213>The Tribunal hurried to compensate the nation for the freedom granted to one accused, so much so that he had not yet left the room when the death sentence already weighed upon the five unfortunate ones, to be executed within twenty-four hours.</t5213> <t5214>The first of the condemned indicated to Darnay the fate that awaited him by raising a finger, a symbol of death among the prisoners, and his companions shouted in unison with a sarcastic tone:</t5214>
<t5215>—Long live the Republic!</t5215>
<t5216>It is true that Darnay did not have more time to listen to the explanations that the condemned could or wished to give him, for no sooner had he stepped out into the street in the company of Doctor Manette than he found himself surrounded by a dense crowd, in which he saw almost all the faces he had seen before in the courtroom, with the exception of two, which he searched for in vain with his eyes.</t5216> <t5217>Once again, he was enveloped by the furious whirlwind that had earlier nearly suffocated him, as they kissed him, embraced him, cried, shouted, and gave themselves over to other outbursts more fitting for madmen than for sane people.</t5217>
<t5218>They forcefully sat him down in a large armchair that they had either taken from the Tribunal's hall or from one of the nearby houses.</t5218> <t5219>They adorned the armchair with a red flag and a spear whose iron tip displayed a red cap.</t5219> <t5220>All the doctor's pleas were not enough to prevent him from being triumphantly carried to his house, seated in that armchair which, borne on shoulders, resembled a throne placed upon a turbulent sea of red caps.</t5220>
<t5221>Getting ahead of that wild procession, which embraced everyone it encountered on the way, the doctor arrived at his house in order to properly prepare his daughter.</t5221> <t5222>Nevertheless, when Carlos was able to descend from his improvised throne and opened his arms to his beloved wife, she fainted in them.</t5222>
<t5223>While Darnay held Lucie, supporting her against his chest, her head bent so that the crowd would not see the copious tears running down her cheeks, some of those who had carried him in triumph began to dance, the others caught on, and seconds later an unrestrained Carmagnole was improvised in the courtyard of the house.</t5223> <t5224>Later, they installed a young woman on the vacant chair, proclaiming her the Goddess of Liberty, carrying her on their shoulders through the adjacent streets, amidst deafening shouts and discordant songs.</t5224>
<t5225>Carlos, after embracing the doctor, whose face bore the look of a victor, after hugging Mr. Lorry, who, panting and breathless, managed to reach him by swimming against the immense wave that danced the Carmagnole, after kissing Lucita, whom he lifted from the ground so she could wrap her little arms around his neck, after hugging the faithful Pross, lifted Lucía in his arms and carried her to her rooms.</t5225>
<t5226>—Lucía... my Lucía... Free... Free!...</t5226>
<t5227>—Oh my dear Carlos!</t5227> <t5228>Allow me, kneeling, to give thanks to God with the same fervor with which I prayed for you!</t5228>
<t5229>Lucía fell to her knees.</t5229> <t5230>All those present bowed their heads reverently and prayed from the depths of their hearts.</t5230> <t5231>When, the prayer finished, Lucía returned to his arms, Carlos said.</t5231>
<t5232>—Now thank your father, my little woman!</t5232> <t5233>No man in France could have done as much for me as he has!</t5233>
<t5234>Lucía rested her head on her father's chest, just as she had done many years before.</t5234> <t5235>The doctor considered himself happy to be able to repay in some way the selfless affection shown by his daughter, deemed all his sufferings worthwhile, and felt a noble pride when thinking of his strength.</t5235>
<t5236>—Be strong in prosperity as you were in the storm, my daughter.</t5236> <t5237>Do not tremble...</t5237> <t5238>Do not cry.</t5238> <t5239>I have saved him.</t5239>
<t5240>VII.</t5240>
<t5241>UNEXPECTED VISIT</t5241>
<t5242>It was not a dream like so many other times; there was Carlos, and yet, his wife trembled, seized by a vague but intense terror.</t5242>
<t5243>The atmosphere was so black and corrupted, the people were so brutally vengeful and cruel, the innocent who had the misfortune to inspire any suspicion, however vague, or to awaken malice, were taken to the slaughterhouse with such terrible regularity, it was so impossible to forget how many, as free of guilt as her husband, and as idolized by their loved ones as Charles was by Lucie, fell to the blows that Dr. Manette's son-in-law had managed to evade, that the heart of his afflicted wife could not free itself from the horrible weight that oppressed it.</t5243> <t5244>The shadows of the winter evening twilight began to envelop the city, and the fateful carts of death continued to roll through the streets.</t5244> <t5245>With her imagination, Lucie followed them, the eyes of her soul searched for her husband among the condemned, and seeing him with her fleshly eyes by her side, she clung to him and trembled more than ever.</t5245>
<t5246>Her father, striving to calm her, laughing at her fears, showed signs of an admirable compassionate superiority, of a manly fortitude that contrasted with the womanly weakness of his daughter.</t5246> <t5247>The attic, the shoemaker's bench, the old man who spent his days sewing shoes, the One Hundred Five, North Tower, were past events of which no traces remained.</t5247> <t5248>He had successfully completed the endeavor he had undertaken with manly courage, he had fulfilled his promise, Carlos was free, why fear?</t5248> <t5249>The doctor had more than enough strength to serve as a robust support for all those who felt their own waning.</t5249>
<t5250>The furnishings of their house could not be more modest; not only because prudence advised it so, to avoid hurting the poverty of the people, but also because they were not rich, for Carlos, during the extended period of his captivity, had to pay an exorbitant price for food, the allowances of his guards, and a proportional part to cover the expenses of prisoners poorer than himself.</t5250> <t5251>Due in part to the aforementioned reasons, and in part to avoid the danger of being spied on within their own home, they had no servants.</t5251> <t5252>The citizen and the citizeness in charge of the porter’s lodge provided the necessary services to the family if circumstances required it, apart from Jeremiah, who had been almost entirely given to them by the good Lorry, and was at their disposal during the day and slept in the house at night.</t5252>
<t5253>The Republic One and Indivisible of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death had decreed that above the doors of all houses, at a specified height, there should be a large signboard on which the names of all the inhabitants of the house would be inscribed in letters of a specified size.</t5253> <t5254>As a result, among the names inscribed on the signboard placed on the door of the doctor's residence was that of Jeremiah Lapa, and on the occasion referred to in this story, not only the name but also the owner of the name was standing by the door, watching the painter called by Doctor Manette to add the name of Charles Evrémonde, also known as Darnay, to the signboard.</t5254>
<t5255>The atmosphere of terror and distrust in which people lived had profoundly altered even the most innocent and harmless habits of life.</t5255> <t5256>In the doctor's house, as in almost all the others, essential and daily consumption items were bought every afternoon in small quantities and from different small shops.</t5256> <t5257>It was the way to avoid attracting attention and to provide the least possible occasion for gossip and envy.</t5257>
<t5258>For several months prior, Miss Pross and Jeremiah Lapa had been in charge of the shopping; the latter carried the basket, the former the money.</t5258> <t5259>Every evening, when the streetlights were lit, both would go out and bring back the necessary consumables for the following day.</t5259> <t5260>Although Miss Pross, given the many years she had lived with a French family, seemed like she should speak French with as much correctness and fluency as English, she knew exactly as much as Jeremiah Lapa, who didn't know a single word, and that was either she lacked the talent or she didn't want to apply it to nonsense (as she called it) like that.</t5260> <t5261>As a result, her commercial system consisted of firing a noun point-blank as soon as she faced the shopkeeper, and if the noun didn't match the item she needed, as was almost always the case, she would look around, grab the item, and not let go until the deal was closed.</t5261> <t5262>As for the price, it was understood without difficulty by raising one finger less than the shopkeeper, regardless of the number of fingers he raised.</t5262>
<t5263>—Mr. Lapa—said Miss Pross, whose eyes sparkled with happiness,—I am ready; and you?</t5263>
<t5264>Jeremiah replied that he was at Miss Pross's service.</t5264>
<t5265>—Today we are in need of everything,—observed Miss Pross,—and among other things, wine.</t5265> <t5266>A tough time awaits us.</t5266> <t5267>Wherever we buy it, we are bound to find plenty of red caps toasting like the damned.</t5267>
<t5268>—They don't break their heads too much to come up with their toasts—observed Jeremías.</t5268><t5269>—I always hear them toast for the same thing; for the One.</t5269>
<t5270>—And who is that one?</t5270>
<t5271>—Who knows.</t5271> <t5272>Unless they are referring to Noah... the one who planted the first vineyard...</t5272>
<t5273>—Ah... I see!</t5273> <t5274>You don't have to be very wise to understand who those wretches are toasting to.</t5274> <t5275>They are toasting to the Killer... to the Evil One.</t5275>
<t5276>—Careful, my friend!—interjected Lucía—Caution, please, a lot of caution!</t5276>
<t5277>—Yes, yes, yes! I will be very prudent; but it seems to me that among us I can say that it is not very pleasant to receive sighs that reek of onions, liquor, and tobacco, mixed with hugs, on those streets.</t5277> <t5278>I am going out; but do not move from beside the fire until I return, my dear young lady.</t5278> <t5279>Take care of the husband you have recovered and fear nothing.</t5279> <t5280>May I ask a question before leaving, Doctor?</t5280>
<t5281>—I think you can take that liberty—replied the doctor with a humorous tone.</t5281>
<t5282>—For all the saints in Heaven, do not speak of freedom, doctor.</t5282> <t5283>I am fed up with freedom—exclaimed Pross.</t5283>
<t5284>—For God's sake, dear; again?—said Lucía.</t5284>
<t5285>—Well, miss—replied Pross, shaking her head solemnly;—if you want me to say what I feel, I will declare that I, as a subject of His Gracious Majesty King George III, laugh at those ragamuffins.</t5285> <t5286>My maxim is: "Cursed be their politics by God; may God thwart their criminal purposes; in God I trust, and long live the King."</t5286>
<t5287>Lapa, in a burst of loyalty to his sovereign, repeated the cheer in a stentorian voice.</t5287>
<t5288>—I celebrate that you are a true Englishman, Mr. Lapa,—said Miss Pross with an approving tone,—although it would have been desirable if you hadn't put so much energy into your shout.</t5288> <t5289>But let's get to the question, Doctor; haven't you yet found a way to leave this damned city forever?</t5289>
<t5290>—No, for now; going out under these circumstances would be dangerous for Carlos.</t5290>
<t5291>—What can you do!—exclaimed Miss Pross, holding back a sigh and looking at Lucie.</t5291><t5292>—We will have patience and wait... Courage, and let the storm rage over the neighbor's head, as my brother Solomon used to say.</t5292> <t5293>Let's go now, Mr. Lorry... Don't move, miss.</t5293>
<t5294>The Pross and Lapa left, leaving Lucía, her husband, the doctor, and Lucita sitting by the warmth of the fire.</t5294> <t5295>They were expecting Mr. Lorry to arrive at any moment.</t5295> <t5296>Miss Pross had lit a light, but she placed it in a corner so that the family could exclusively enjoy the faint light radiating from the fireplace.</t5296> <t5297>Lucita, sitting on her grandfather's knee, was listening to the story of a great and powerful fairy who once broke the strong walls of a dungeon to free a captive who had once rendered a service to the fairy.</t5297>
<t5298>—What is that?—Lucía suddenly exclaimed.</t5298>
<t5299>—My dear!—replied the doctor, pausing the story—Calm yourself.</t5299> <t5300>Your nervous disorder is extraordinary.</t5300> <t5301>The most insignificant thing... even without any reason... alarms you.</t5301> <t5302>You have me... your father, my daughter.</t5302>
<t5303>—I thought I heard the sound of footsteps on the stairs—Lucía stammered.</t5303>
<t5304>—Silly girl...!</t5304> <t5305>The staircase is as silent as a tomb.</t5305>
<t5306>As the last word left his lips, there was a knock at the door.</t5306>
<t5307>—Oh, father... my father!</t5307> <t5308>What could it be?</t5308> <t5309>Let Carlos hide...! Save him!</t5309>
<t5310>—Dear daughter!—replied the doctor, standing up and placing his hand on Lucía's shoulder.</t5310><t5311>—I have already saved him.</t5311> <t5312>I don't understand your weakness... I'm going to open the door.</t5312>
<t5313>He took the candlestick in his hand, crossed the two intermediate rooms, and opened the door.</t5313> <t5314>Four men of wild appearance, covered with red caps and armed with sabers and pistols, entered the reception area, from where they proceeded to the room where the family was.</t5314>
<t5315>"Citizen Evrémonde?" asked the one who entered first.</t5315>
<t5316>—Who is looking for him?—asked Darnay.</t5316>
<t5317>—I... we will look for him.</t5317> <t5318>I know you, Evrémonde; I saw you yesterday in the Tribunal room.</t5318> <t5319>You are once again a prisoner of the Republic.</t5319>
<t5320>The four men surrounded the group formed by Darnay, his wife, and their little daughter, who had embraced him.</t5320>
<t5321>—How and why am I a prisoner again?</t5321>
<t5322>—Come with us to the Consulate, and tomorrow you will be able to satisfy your curiosity.</t5322> <t5323>Tomorrow you must appear before the Court.</t5323>
<t5324>Dr. Manette, whom the unexpected visit had left in a perfectly astonished state, to the point of seeming like a statue with a candlestick in hand, shook off his stupor after hearing the last words, placed the candlestick on the mantelpiece, faced the one who was leading the conversation, and, grabbing him by the collar of his shirt, red like his cap, said:</t5324>
<t5325>—You said you know him; do you know me as well?</t5325>
<t5326>—Yes; I know you, citizen doctor.</t5326>
<t5327>—We all know you, citizen doctor—added the remaining three.</t5327>
<t5328>The old man let his gaze wander over the faces of the four men, and after a pause, he replied, lowering his voice:</t5328>
<t5329>—Do you want to answer me the question he asked you?</t5329> <t5330>Why does it catch on again?</t5330>
<t5331>—Citizen doctor,—replied the first speaker with evident repugnance,—he has been denounced by the San Antonio Section... to which this citizen belongs—he added, pointing with his hand to the individual who was beside him.</t5331>
<t5332>The mentioned citizen made an affirmative nod and said:</t5332>
<t5333>—He has been accused by San Antonio.</t5333>
<t5334>—Of what?</t5334>
<t5335>"Citizen doctor," replied the first, "ask no more questions."</t5335> <t5336>"If the Republic demands sacrifices from you, you, as the good patriot that you are, will consider yourself happy to make them."</t5336> <t5337>"Above all and before all, the Republic."</t5337> <t5338>"The People are sovereign."</t5338> <t5339>"Evrémonde, we are in a hurry."</t5339>
<t5340>—One more word—objected the doctor.</t5340><t5341>—Do you want to tell me who reported him?</t5341>
<t5342>—I would be neglecting my duty...</t5342> <t5343>Tomorrow you can ask Saint Anthony.</t5343>
<t5344>The doctor then directed a look at another of the men, who moved with a certain expression of discomfort, rubbed his beard, and said:</t5344>
<t5345>—Well! It is true that we cannot say it without failing in our duty; but I have no objection to stating that he has been accused... indeed of great crimes, by Citizen and Citizeness Defarge... and also, by another person.</t5345>
<t5346>—Who is this other person?</t5346>
<t5347>—Are you asking that, citizen doctor?</t5347>
<t5348>—Yes.</t5348>
<t5349>—You'll know tomorrow—replied the one from San Antonio with a strange intonation.</t5349><t5350>—Now, I am mute!</t5350>
<t5351>VIII.</t5351>
<t5352>AN ORIGINAL GAME</t5352>
<t5353>Immersed in the blissful ignorance of the new misfortune that had befallen the family, Miss Pross left behind a portion of narrow alleyways and crossed the river by the New Bridge, mentally reviewing the number of purchases she had to make.</t5353> <t5354>Walking beside her was Lapa, carrying the basket.</t5354> <t5355>Both of them, although seemingly only focused on examining the shops open to the right and left of the streets they traversed, were on the lookout for groups of patriots, especially if they were very numerous, and frequently changed their route to avoid encountering those who spoke with excessive animation.</t5355> <t5356>It was a cold and damp afternoon.</t5356> <t5357>The points of light that dotted the gray layer covering the river indicated the places where barges converted into workshops by those manufacturing weapons for the Republic's army were anchored.</t5357> <t5358>Woe to the mortal who dared to mock that army!</t5358> <t5359>Woe to the one who held a rank in that army that they did not deserve!</t5359> <t5360>They would have been better off if their beard had never grown, for the National Barber's Razor would shave it off as a blessing.</t5360>
<t5361>After buying a portion of food items and a quantity of oil for the lamp, Miss Pross thought about acquiring the wine she needed.</t5361> <t5362>She scorned a number of taverns and finally favored one, placed under the patronage of the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, situated a short distance from the National Palace, formerly the Tuileries, an establishment quieter than any of its counterparts found up to that point, in which it was true that many red caps were seen, but they were less abundant than in the others.</t5362> <t5363>After consulting Lapa, and seeing that he was of the same opinion, Miss Pross entered the temple of the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, accompanied by her gentleman.</t5363>
<t5364>Without paying much attention to the dim lights, to the men with pipes in their mouths playing with grimy cards or yellowed dominoes, to the laborer who, with his shirt sleeves rolled up to his shoulders and his chest bare, loudly read a newspaper to a group of people listening with their mouths open, to the weapons that filled the tables or hung from the drinkers' waists, nor to the three or four patrons who were sleeping off their drunkenness, sprawled face down on the floor, and who, more than men, looked like lying bears or mastiffs, the two buyers approached the counter and asked for what they needed.</t5364>
<t5365>While the innkeeper measured the wine, a man, who was talking with another in a corner of the establishment, stood up and began to walk.</t5365> <t5366>To get out to the street, he had to pass by Miss Pross, which is nothing unusual, but what was unusual was that, as soon as he bumped into her, a piercing scream tore through the air followed by a semi-fainting of the lady.</t5366>
<t5367>All the people in the tavern stood up.</t5367> <t5368>It was so common to see people being killed outright for such a justified reason as defending any opinion, that everyone looked to see who was the mortal falling lifeless to the ground, but to their general astonishment, the only thing they saw was a couple, a man and a woman, staring at each other with extraordinary intensity, and the man seemed French, and a red republican, and the woman was undoubtedly English.</t5368>
<t5369>The picturesque phrases with which the good disciples of the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity expressed their disillusionment sounded in the ears of Miss Pross and her companion as if they had been spoken in Hebrew or Chaldean.</t5369> <t5370>They only understood that they were shouted, as their surprise allowed them no more.</t5370> <t5371>We speak in the plural because, if Miss Pross was surprised, Jeremiah Lapa was on the verge of falling to the ground under the violent blow of his stupefaction.</t5371>
<t5372>—What is it?—asked the man who was the cause of Miss Pross's scream.</t5372>
<t5373>The two words had been spoken in English, with a brusque and threatening accent and a very low tone of voice.</t5373>
<t5374>—Oh Solomon...</t5374> <t5375>Dear Solomon!—exclaimed Miss Pross, clasping her hands.</t5375><t5376>—At last I find you, after so many years of absence, after so many years without news of you!</t5376>
<t5377>—Don't call me Solomon.</t5377> <t5378>Are you seeking my death, wretched woman?—asked the man, casting frightened glances around.</t5378>
<t5379>—Brother... my brother!—exclaimed Miss Pross, in a flood of tears—Have I behaved so badly towards you that you ask me such a cruel question?</t5379>
<t5380>—Well, put that devilish tongue of yours in your pocket!—grumbled Salomón.</t5380><t5381>—If you want to tell me something, let's go outside.</t5381> <t5382>Pay for the wine and let's go... Who is that man?</t5382>
<t5383>—It is Mr. Lapa—answered Miss Pross with dismay.</t5383>
<t5384>—Well, let him come out too...</t5384> <t5385>But what is that?</t5385> <t5386>Does that person take me for a ghost?</t5386>
<t5387>The question was very much in place, for Lapa was indeed looking at him as one looks at a specter.</t5387> <t5388>However, he did not part his lips, and Miss Pross, shedding tears, paid for the wine.</t5388> <t5389>Meanwhile, Solomon addressed the disciples of the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity and gave them, in French, some explanations that were enough for all of them to return to their respective posts.</t5389>
<t5390>—Let's see—said Solomon, once he reached a dark corner of the street—What is it that you want from me?</t5390>
<t5391>—It is horrifying to meet a beloved brother who shows not the slightest sign of affection to the sister who was always tender and loving towards him!</t5391>
<t5392>—Bah! Nonsense!—exclaimed Solomon, brushing Miss Pross's forehead with his lips—Are you happy now?</t5392>
<t5393>Miss Pross shook her head and burst into tears again.</t5393>
<t5394>—If you think that you have surprised me, you are completely mistaken; I was not surprised to find you.</t5394> <t5395>I knew you were in Paris, so it's good for you to know that there are very few people in Paris who live without me knowing about it.</t5395> <t5396>If you don't want to put my existence in grave danger... I'm tempted to believe that this is your intention... continue on your way as soon as possible, and let me continue on mine.</t5396> <t5397>I have many occupations... I am a public official.</t5397>
<t5398>—My brother Solomon, English by birth and soul, my brother Solomon, who in his homeland could have been one of the greatest men, a public official in a country that is not his own, depending on men who are not English... and what men, Good heavens!</t5398> <t5399>I would have preferred to find you dead in his...!</t5399>
<t5400>—I believe it!... I supposed it!...</t5400> <t5401>I knew it for sure!—exclaimed her brother, interrupting her.</t5401><t5402>—What you want is my death.</t5402> <t5403>My tender, my loving sister will make them list me among the suspects...</t5403> <t5404>That is to say; she is already doing it.</t5404>
<t5405>—God forbid!—cried Miss Pross.</t5405><t5406>—I have loved you much, Solomon, I love you much; but I would have preferred never to see you again, than to find you as I find you.</t5406> <t5407>Tell me a word of affection, tell me that you do not hate me, that hatred does not separate us, and I will leave without detaining you a second longer.</t5407>
<t5408>Solomon was uttering the requested word of affection, providing evidence of a condescension that surely would not have existed had their respective positions been reversed, when unexpectedly Jeremiah Lapa interjected into the conversation, placing a paw on the affectionate brother's shoulder and saying in a hoarse voice:</t5408>
<t5409>—It seems to me that I will also be allowed to ask a question.</t5409> <t5410>Would you tell me if your name is Juan Salomón or Salomón Juan?</t5410>
<t5411>The public official, in response, turned towards the person breaking their silence to ask a question that unsettled him, and stood staring at him intently with visible suspicion.</t5411>
<t5412>—I am waiting—replied Lapa.</t5412><t5413>—Have you suddenly become mute?</t5413> <t5414>Juan Salomón or Salomón Juan?</t5414> <t5415>Which one is it?</t5415> <t5416>The young lady calls you Salomón, and it is to be assumed that she knows your name well, since she is your sister, as I see.</t5416> <t5417>But the fact is that I know you as Juan.</t5417> <t5418>Which of the two names is the real one?</t5418> <t5419>I say the same about the last name.</t5419> <t5420>In England, you were not called Pross.</t5420>
<t5421>—But what are you saying?</t5421>
<t5422>—I don't even know it very well myself, for I confess that I don't remember the last name you had on the opposite shore of the Canal.</t5422>
<t5423>—Have you forgotten?</t5423>
<t5424>—Yes; but I would swear it was a two-syllable surname.</t5424>
<t5425>—Really!</t5425>
<t5426>—Really.</t5426> <t5427>Pross has only one syllable; the other had two...</t5427> <t5428>In the name of the Father of Lies, who is undoubtedly your father, could you tell me what your name was when you practiced the honorable profession of informer at the Old Bailey?</t5428>
<t5429>—Barsad!—answered another voice, joining the conversation.</t5429>
<t5430>The one who had just spoken was our old friend Sydney Carton.</t5430> <t5431>With both hands placed behind his back under the tails of his coat, he had positioned himself next to Lapa, affecting the same nonchalance with which he used to attend the sessions at the Old Bailey.</t5431>
<t5432>—Do not be alarmed, Miss Pross—he replied.</t5432><t5433>—Yesterday afternoon I presented myself at Mr. Lorry's residence, much to the surprise of this gentleman, who was far from expecting my visit.</t5433> <t5434>We both agreed that I would not be seen anywhere until the matter was definitively and satisfactorily resolved, or until my presence was necessary.</t5434> <t5435>Adhering to the agreement, I have come here because it is essential that I exchange a few words with your brother.</t5435> <t5436>I very much regret that you are the sister of such an untrustworthy individual; I very much regret that you have for a brother a hangman's blackbird.</t5436>
<t5437>This was the name by which spies were usually referred to.</t5437>
<t5438>—How dare you—asked the spy, pale as a corpse—to tell me...?</t5438>
<t5439>—I will explain myself, so that you see I am not speaking nonsense—replied Carton.</t5439><t5440>—Half an hour ago, I was contemplating the walls of the Conciergerie when I saw you coming out of its doors.</t5440> <t5441>Among other qualities, some good, some bad, I have the ability to remember faces well, and you can count that yours is one that is hard to forget.</t5441> <t5442>I was surprised to see you in that place, and since, on the other hand, I have my reasons to associate your person with the misfortunes of a friend, who is now more unfortunate than ever, the idea occurred to me to follow you.</t5442> <t5443>Trailing closely behind you, I entered the tavern and sat next to you.</t5443> <t5444>From your conversation, and from the murmurs of admiration you elicited from your listeners, it was not difficult for me to infer what your profession is.</t5444> <t5445>What I initially did by chance gradually became a determined objective, Mr. Barsad.</t5445>
<t5446>—And that objective?...—asked the spy.</t5446>
<t5447>—It would be bothersome, and even dangerous, to explain it on the street.</t5447> <t5448>Would you be so kind as to accompany me for a few minutes... to Tellson's Bank, for example?</t5448>
<t5449>—Under threat?</t5449>
<t5450>—Bah! Did I talk about threats?</t5450>
<t5451>—So, why on earth would I go there?</t5451>
<t5452>—Frankly, Mr. Barsad; I can't say.</t5452>
<t5453>—Can't you, or won't you, sir?—asked the spy with a certain hesitation.</t5453>
<t5454>—You interpret me wonderfully well; I do not want to.</t5454>
<t5455>The tone of glacial indifference with which Carton spoke was a very powerful auxiliary to his prodigious skill.</t5455> <t5456>His lynx-like vision noticed it from the first moment, and it is said that he took full advantage of it.</t5456>
<t5457>—Remember what I tell you and never forget it!—exclaimed Barsad, directing a furious look of reproach at his sister.</t5457><t5458>—It will be your doing if something bad happens to me.</t5458>
<t5459>"Come on, come on, Mr. Barsad!" said Carton. "Don't be ungrateful."</t5459> <t5460>"Be thankful for the respect your sister inspires in me and the kindness with which I am making you a proposition that should leave us all satisfied."</t5460> <t5461>"Will you accompany me to the Bank?"</t5461>
<t5462>—Yes; I will accompany you.</t5462> <t5463>I am ready to hear what you wish to tell me.</t5463>
<t5464>—First of all, we will escort your sister to the corner of the house where she lives.</t5464> <t5465>Please accept my arm, Miss Pross.</t5465> <t5466>Given the circumstances the city is going through, you should not go alone and unprotected, and since the man accompanying you knows Mr. Barsad, I take the liberty of inviting him to come with us to Mr. Lorry's residence.</t5466> <t5467>Are we ready?</t5467> <t5468>Yes?</t5468> <t5469>Then let's go.</t5469>
<t5470>Later, Miss Pross remembered, and never forgot in her life, that when she clung to Carton's arm and looked into his face to make a silent but eloquent plea on behalf of her brother, she noticed in the strength of his arm and in the expression of his eyes something that not only contradicted Carton's lightness of tone and manner, but also transformed and elevated the man.</t5470> <t5471>If at the moment it did not catch her attention, it was because she was too preoccupied with the fears inspired by the fate of a brother so undeserving of her affection to make observations.</t5471>
<t5472>After bidding farewell to Miss Pross in the vicinity of the doctor's house, Carton, walking between Barsad and Jeremiah Cruncher, headed towards the building of Tellson's Bank, which was very close by.</t5472>
<t5473>Lorry, who had just finished eating and was sitting by the warmth of the fire, turned his head upon hearing the footsteps of his visitors, and could not help but show a gesture of surprise when he saw an unfamiliar face.</t5473>
<t5474>"I present to you Miss Pross's brother," said Carton, "Mr. Barsad."</t5474>
<t5475>—Barsad?—repeated Lorry.</t5475><t5476>—Barsad?</t5476> <t5477>I seem to remember that surname... and the face of the one who bears it.</t5477>
<t5478>—Didn't I tell you before that you have a face that is hard to forget, Mr. Barsad?—asked Carton coldly.</t5478><t5479>—Do me the favor of sitting down.</t5479>
<t5480>Carton, at the same time as he brought a chair closer, provided Lorry with the link he had been searching for to connect the chain of his memories.</t5480>
<t5481>—Witness of that case—said Carton simply.</t5481>
<t5482>It was enough for Lorry to remember, and also for him to look at Barsad with visible disgust.</t5482>
<t5483>—Miss Pross has recognized in Mr. Barsad the affectionate brother she has so often heard you speak of—observed Carton.</t5483><t5484>—Barsad has not denied the relationship...</t5484> <t5485>But let's move on to worse news; Darnay has been imprisoned again.</t5485>
<t5486>—What are you telling me!—exclaimed Lorry, deeply dismayed.</t5486><t5487>—It hasn't been two hours since I left him at his house free and happy, and I was just about to go see him.</t5487>
<t5488>—Well, he is imprisoned.</t5488> <t5489>When did they arrest him, Barsad?</t5489>
<t5490>—In any case, it must have been just a moment ago.</t5490>
<t5491>—Barsad is a reliable source of information in this matter—observed Carton.</t5491><t5492>—I heard the news from his lips when he was telling it, between glasses of brandy, to a friend of his, an informer like him.</t5492> <t5493>It seems that he accompanied those in charge of arresting him up to the door of the doctor's house, leaving when he saw that the doorman was letting them in.</t5493> <t5494>Therefore, doubt is impossible.</t5494>
<t5495>Lorry understood that the misfortune was real.</t5495> <t5496>In his mind, he felt the harsh struggle of a thousand confused and contradictory ideas, but he realized how crucial it was not to lose his presence of mind and, with titanic efforts, he controlled himself, regained his composure, and remained silent and attentive.</t5496>
<t5497>—It is to be hoped... I have that confidence—replied Carton—that the doctor's name and his influence on the masses will be so effective tomorrow... Did you not say, Barsad, that he is to appear before the Tribunal tomorrow?</t5497>
<t5498>—Yes; I think the appearance will be tomorrow.</t5498>
<t5499>—...</t5499> <t5500>As effective tomorrow, and as decisive, as today; but it is not impossible that the opposite may occur.</t5500> <t5501>I will confess, Mr. Lorry, that the fact that the doctor has not been able to prevent the imprisonment inspires me with great fears.</t5501>
<t5502>—Perhaps he didn't even suspect the possibility of danger—replied Lorry.</t5502>
<t5503>—What, in my opinion, would be a highly alarming circumstance, given how closely he is identified with his son-in-law.</t5503>
<t5504>—It's true—replied Lorry, resting his chin on the palm of his hand and looking at Carton with a downcast expression.</t5504>
<t5505>—In short—continued Carton:—when a desperate game is played and desperate bets are placed, one must also resort to desperate measures.</t5505> <t5506>Let the doctor play with the winning cards, while I will handle the losing ones.</t5506> <t5507>Let the doctor engage in the game aimed at getting his son-in-law out of the Consistory; meanwhile, I will play another independent game with the goal of putting a friend into the Consistory.</t5507> <t5508>The friend I intend to put in, Mr. Barsad, is you.</t5508>
<t5509>—You will need to gather very good cards to win that game, replied the spy.</t5509>
<t5510>"I have already gathered them, and I am going to lay them face up... but you know, Mr. Lorry, how clumsy I am if I don't spur my wits with a few drinks."</t5510> <t5511>"If you could give me a little brandy, I would appreciate it."</t5511>
<t5512>He was served the liquor, of which he took two consecutive glasses.</t5512>
<t5513>—Mr. Barsad—he said, setting the bottle aside and speaking as if he held a collection of cards in his hand,—executioner's blackbird, emissary of the republican committees, today a jailer, yesterday a prisoner, always a spy and secret informer, whose value here increases considerably due to the circumstance of being English, and therefore less exposed to suspicion than any Frenchman, presents himself to the very ones he serves under a false name; this triumph is of the first order.</t5513> <t5514>Mr. Barsad, today in the pay of the French revolutionary government, served, not long ago, the aristocratic English government, sworn enemy of France and its liberties; it seems to me that I have just shown another card that is hard to beat.</t5514> <t5515>If we now enter the realm of suspicions and deductions, we will find one, clear as daylight, a suspicion that I will express with the following words: Mr. Barsad, salaried informer of the aristocratic English government, is at the same time an agent of Pitt, a cunning enemy who will strike the Republic at its heart, a treacherous Englishman, agent, instrument, author of all those indignities that everyone talks about and no one is able to prove.</t5515> <t5516>This is a triumph that almost assures the game.</t5516> <t5517>Are you following my game, Mr. Barsad?</t5517>
<t5518>—I am beginning to understand the importance of the letters, but I still don't know how you plan to play them—replied the spy, visibly uneasy.</t5518>
<t5519>—I begin by playing the next trump card: A denunciation against the so-called Barsad before the nearest district Committee.</t5519> <t5520>Look at your cards, Barsad, and play... without haste, no one is rushing us.</t5520>
<t5521>He took the bottle again, poured himself another glass, drank it with unperturbed calmness, and waited.</t5521> <t5522>He saw that the spy feared that the libations would result in an immediate denunciation, and, no doubt to increase the fear, he poured and downed the fourth glass.</t5522>
<t5523>—Take all the time you need, Barsad, lest you lose the game on the first move.</t5523>
<t5524>Barsad was a weaker adversary than Carton had supposed.</t5524> <t5525>To tell the truth, he had very bad cards in his game, and he knew it, although Carton did not.</t5525> <t5526>He knew, for example, that, dismissed from his honorable position in England as a result of unforgivable blunders committed in the exercise of it, he crossed the Channel and offered his services in France, where they were accepted, at first, to tempt and extract information from his compatriots, and later, to tempt and extract information from the French.</t5526> <t5527>He knew that, during the overthrown government, he was in charge of monitoring the Saint Antoine district and Defarge's tavern; that he received from the police the necessary data about the captivity, freedom, and history of Dr. Manette, thanks to which he believed he would manage to become a confidential friend of the Defarges, although he soon had to convince himself that, on some occasions, those who seek wool come back shorn.</t5527> <t5528>He always remembered with terror that that terrible tavern keeper had been knitting while he tried to extract information from her, and he would tremble every time he recalled that she looked at him with a somber expression while her fingers moved swiftly.</t5528> <t5529>He had seen her countless times since then in the Saint Antoine district, armed with her knitting records and denouncing people whose heads were soon severed by the guillotine.</t5529> <t5530>He knew, as all those who hold jobs like his do, that the storm raged over his head at all hours; that his head was in danger, that escape was impossible, that with each moment he brought his neck closer to the blade, and that, despite the services rendered to the cause of the reigning terror, a single word was enough to send him to the scaffold.</t5530> <t5531>No sooner had he been denounced, with all or part of the grave charges just insinuated against him, than he understood that that formidable woman, of whose implacable character he had seen ample proof, would exhibit the fatal record that would dispel the last possibility of salvation.</t5531> <t5532>Add to this the law, proven a thousand times, that all informers, all secret informers, are cowards by temperament, men who are easily frightened, and one can understand the state of mind in which Barsad was left.</t5532>
<t5533>—It seems that your letters are not much to their liking—said Carton with his usual calm.</t5533><t5534>—Don't you play?</t5534>
<t5535>—I believe, sir—responded Barsad, turning towards Lorry and speaking with fawning humility,—that I find myself in the position of requesting from a gentleman of your years and benevolence the favor of asking this other gentleman, much younger than you, to refrain from playing the card he just mentioned to me.</t5535> <t5536>I confess that I am a spy, and I acknowledge that the profession honors no one, although you will admit that someone has to perform it; but this gentleman is not a spy, this gentleman is not an informer; and since he is not one now, what need is there for him to be one in the future?</t5536>
<t5537>—I will play my card, Mr. Barsad—said Carton, without waiting for Lorry to reply,—without the slightest scruple and within five minutes.</t5537>
<t5538>—I had harbored the hope, gentlemen, that, out of consideration for my sister...</t5538>
<t5539>"The greatest favor we can do for your sister is to free her forever from a brother like you," replied Carton.</t5539>
<t5540>—Do you believe so, sir?</t5540>
<t5541>—I am absolutely convinced of it.</t5541>
<t5542>The spy, with all his humility, which so greatly contrasted with his terrorist attire and probably with his ordinary manner of being, received such a harsh blow from the inscrutability of Carton, who had always been a mystery to men more honest and clever than he, that he wavered, trembled, and gave himself up for lost.</t5542> <t5543>While disconcerted, stupefied, he remained silent, not knowing how to get out of the predicament, Carton replied:</t5543>
<t5544>—I am examining my letters again, and I find one, as good as the ones listed, that I had not mentioned.</t5544> <t5545>Who is that colleague of yours, who spoke as if he had spent his entire life grazing in prisons?</t5545>
<t5546>—He is a Frenchman; you do not know him—replied the spy quickly.</t5546>
<t5547>—French, eh?—exclaimed Carton, as if he wasn't thinking about what he was saying—could be.</t5547>
<t5548>—It is... I assure you... although that is the least of it—said the spy.</t5548>
<t5549>—Although that is the least of it...—repeated Carton mechanically—although that is the least of it... Yes... it is the least of it...</t5549> <t5550>But the fact is that I know that face.</t5550>
<t5551>—I don't think so...</t5551> <t5552>Of course, I assure you that no... It's not possible...</t5552>
<t5553>—It's not possible...—murmured Carton, filling his cup for the fifth time, which fortunately was small.</t5553><t5554>—It's not possible...</t5554> <t5555>He speaks French correctly... but with a slightly foreign accent...</t5555>
<t5556>—Provincial accent—explained the spy.</t5556>
<t5557>—No! Foreign accent!—replied Carton, slamming his fist on the table.</t5557><t5558>—It's Cly!</t5558> <t5559>Disguised, disfigured, but the very same Cly!</t5559> <t5560>I've had him in my sight many times at the Old Bailey.</t5560>
<t5561>—You get worked up easily, sir—said Barsad with a smile that accentuated the tilt of his aquiline nose,—which gives me an advantage over you.</t5561> <t5562>Cly, my colleague from another time, I have no hesitation in confessing, died a number of years ago.</t5562> <t5563>I took care of him myself during his final illness.</t5563> <t5564>He was buried in London, in the cemetery of the parish of St. Pancras.</t5564> <t5565>I did not accompany him to the cemetery, because I feared the crowds, as my friend and colleague had the misfortune of becoming extraordinarily unpopular; but I helped those who placed him in the coffin.</t5565>
<t5566>Suddenly, Lorry saw the shadow of a goblin or something similar projected on the wall.</t5566> <t5567>He turned his head looking for the source of the projection, and with indescribable surprise, noticed that it was on the head of Jeremiah Lapa, whose hair, resembling steel spikes, had stood on end.</t5567>
<t5568>"—Come to your senses, sir, and do not be deceived by suspicions that have no rational basis," replied the spy.</t5568><t5569>"—To demonstrate to you how mistaken you are, and the lack of any basis for your assumption, I am going to present you with a proper death certificate for Cly, a certificate that I always carry in my pocket."</t5569> <t5570>"Take it," he added, offering his interlocutor a folded paper.</t5570><t5571>"—Read it, read it... take it in your hands, examine it carefully... it is not fake, no, but authentic and very authentic!"</t5571>
<t5572>Lorry observed that the shadow cast on the wall was lengthening.</t5572> <t5573>It was because Lapa had risen from his seat and was approaching the spy, beside whom he positioned himself without being seen or heard by him.</t5573> <t5574>Placing his right hand on Barsad's shoulder, he asked:</t5574>
<t5575>—So it was you who put Rogerio Cly inside the coffin?</t5575>
<t5576>—I went; yes.</t5576>
<t5577>—And who got him out of it?</t5577>
<t5578>Barsad, leaning back in his chair, stammered:</t5578>
<t5579>—What do your words mean?</t5579>
<t5580>—It means—Lapa replied—that Cly's corpse was never inside the coffin.</t5580> <t5581>No... and no!</t5581> <t5582>Off with my head if it was!</t5582>
<t5583>The spy alternately looked at the two gentlemen, who, in turn, gazed with infinite astonishment at Lapa.</t5583>
<t5584>—And I add—replied Jeremías Lapa—that you buried street cobblestones and dirt inside that coffin.</t5584> <t5585>Don't come here with nonsense or with pretensions of making me believe that they buried Cly, because I, and two other men, know very well what was inside the coffin.</t5585>
<t5586>—But how do you know?</t5586>
<t5587>—And what business is it of yours?—Lapa growled.</t5587><t5588>—I have despised you for a long time, yes, sir, because even in matters as serious as death, you dare to deceive honest workers who only aspire to work.</t5588> <t5589>Know this, my good sir, for less than half a guinea, I would grab you by the neck and strangle you!</t5589>
<t5590>Both Carton and Lorry, whose astonishment had reached its peak, begged Jeremiah Lapa to moderate himself and to explain to them what was an enigma of impossible solution.</t5590>
<t5591>—Another day I will do it, sir—replied Lapa, not inclined to give the explanations that were asked of him,—for this is not a suitable occasion to enter into explanations.</t5591> <t5592>What I want to make clear is that that individual knows very well that Cly never intended to be locked in that coffin.</t5592> <t5593>Let that liar dare to repeat it, and I will strangle him with my claws or run off to denounce him.</t5593>
<t5594>—Hmm!—grumbled Carton.</t5594><t5595>—I encounter another triumph, Barsad.</t5595> <t5596>Here in Paris, where the atmosphere is filled with suspicion, it is quite certain that one who, like you, maintains close relations with another aristocratic spy of your same ilk, who bears the mystery of having pretended to be dead and buried only to resurrect against all divine and human laws, does not escape alive from a denunciation.</t5596> <t5597>Machinations against the Republic concocted by foreigners whom the Republic has on its payroll... Bad, bad!</t5597> <t5598>It is a very great triumph... the triumph of the Guillotine, Barsad.</t5598> <t5599>Are you not playing?</t5599>
<t5600>—No! I don't play!—replied the spy.</t5600><t5601>—I surrender!</t5601> <t5602>I confess that we had become so unpopular with the vile rabble, that I managed to escape from England where I was at risk of being hanged, and Cly was so compromised that if he didn't die, it's certain that he wouldn't have been able to get out even by air.</t5602> <t5603>What amazes me, what stuns me, what drives me crazy, is that this man knows that Cly wasn't buried.</t5603> <t5604>How did he find out?</t5604>
<t5605>—Don't get worked up, my good sir—replied Lapa—You'd do well to pay attention to what these gentlemen are telling you.</t5605> <t5606>But don't forget that for less than half a guinea, I'll strangle you with my own hands.</t5606>
<t5607>The executioner's blackbird turned to Carton and spoke with a decisiveness he had not shown until that moment:</t5607>
<t5608>—I go on duty very soon, and I cannot afford to linger any longer.</t5608> <t5609>You told me you wanted to make me a proposition; would you be so kind as to state it?</t5609> <t5610>I will start by telling you not to ask me for great things, not to demand anything that conflicts with my position, nothing that puts my head at greater risk than it already is, for I prefer to risk my life on the contingencies of a refusal rather than on those of consent.</t5610> <t5611>You spoke earlier of a desperate venture; we are all desperate now; for my part, I confess that I am as desperate as anyone.</t5611> <t5612>Another thing; without the slightest scruple, I will betray you if I see it suits me, for when the house collapses, one seeks an exit among the heaps of ruins.</t5612> <t5613>Having made these warnings, which you should not lose sight of, tell me what you want from me.</t5613>
<t5614>—Very little.</t5614> <t5615>Aren't you the jailer of the Ministry?</t5615>
<t5616>—Instead of answering your question, I will tell you that there is no possible escape—replied the spy with determination.</t5616>
<t5617>—And I demand that you answer what I just asked.</t5617>
<t5618>—I am sometimes.</t5618>
<t5619>—Can he be when he wants to?</t5619>
<t5620>—I can enter and leave the Concierge's office whenever I want.</t5620>
<t5621>Carton filled another small glass of liquor, poured it drop by drop on the ground, and after a few moments of reflection said:</t5621>
<t5622>—Up to this point, we have spoken in the presence of these two gentlemen because it was convenient for me that someone, besides the two of us, should be aware of the value of the letters I have, but what remains is something that should stay between you and me.</t5622> <t5623>Accompany me to that room, where we will exchange the few remaining words.</t5623>
<t5624>IX.</t5624>
<t5625>THE GAME IS ON</t5625>
<t5626>While Sydney Carton and the executioner's blackbird, locked in the adjoining room, conferred in such low voices that not the slightest sound filtered through the door's cracks, Lorry watched Jeremiah Lapa with manifest suspicion and deep distrust.</t5626> <t5627>It should be noted that the effect produced by the good banker's persistent gaze on the honest craftsman was not the most suitable for dispelling apprehensions; he shifted the leg on which the weight of his body rested as frequently as if he had fifty limbs and wished to test the sturdiness of each; he examined his nails with such scrupulous attention that it aroused suspicion, and whenever his eyes met Lorry's scrutinizing ones, he was seized by a fit of coughing that forced him to bring his hand to his mouth, a symptom that rarely, if ever, accompanies perfect frankness of character.</t5627>
<t5628>—Jeremiah!—exclaimed Lorry suddenly.</t5628><t5629>—Come here!</t5629>
<t5630>Lapa approached walking in the manner of a crab, that is, sideways.</t5630>
<t5631>—What jobs have you had besides being a bank messenger?</t5631>
<t5632>After a rather thorough meditation, and after seeking an illuminating idea in the fixed gaze of his superior, Lapa replied:</t5632>
<t5633>—I have been a farmer.</t5633>
<t5634>—I harbor well-founded fears—replied Lorry, moving his hand with a fierce gesture—that you have been an errand man for the respectable Tellson's Bank to mislead, to have a screen that covered other occupations contrary to the Law, occupations simply infamous.</t5634> <t5635>If so, do not expect any consideration from me as soon as we reach England; if so, do not expect me to keep the secret either.</t5635> <t5636>Tellson must know it, and they will know it.</t5636>
<t5637>—I cannot believe, sir,—replied Lapa humbly—that a gentleman like you, a gentleman in whose service I have grown old, would decide to cause me such considerable harm without thinking it over very well first..., even if what you suspect were true.</t5637> <t5638>I am not saying that it is; but if it were, I would always trust that you would not treat me so badly.</t5638> <t5639>Assuming that it were what you fear, even then the matter would have to be studied from two points of view, since it does not have just one, but two.</t5639> <t5640>There are doctors in medicine, and not a few, who find gold guineas where an honest tradesman finds nothing but miserable pennies...</t5640> <t5641>Not even pennies!</t5641> <t5642>Half pennies...</t5642> <t5643>And not even half pennies; quarter pennies... and that's generous.</t5643> <t5644>And what do you say about those who enter and leave Tellson's Bank, passing by the honest tradesman who is sitting by the door on an old stool, while they ride in luxurious carriages?</t5644> <t5645>Isn't it a sight to awaken the most dormant appetite?</t5645> <t5646>Add to all that the presence in England of a Mrs. Lapa who spends day and night on her knees praying to ruin all her husband's business, while the wives of the doctors and those who ride in luxurious carriages pray for the prosperity of their respective households.</t5646> <t5647>Another thing; if what you suspect were true, which I am not saying it is, do you think I would become very rich by taking the leftovers from the undertakers, what the sacristans didn't want, what the cemetery watchmen scorned?</t5647> <t5648>No, Mr. Lorry, no! It's a lost trade; believe me.</t5648>
<t5649>—Ugh!—exclaimed Lorry—You horrify me!</t5649>
<t5650>—The offer that I humbly dare to make to you, even if what you suspect were true, which I am not saying it is, is...</t5650>
<t5651>—Don't come with lies!</t5651>
<t5652>—No, sir; I will speak truthfully.</t5652> <t5653>The humble offer I wish to make is the following: on the bench placed on the sidewalk of the Tribunal, my son, who is almost a man, will sit, run errands, keep watch, and strive to perform the duties that I have carried out until now, if you so wish.</t5653> <t5654>If what you fear were true, which I am not saying it is, nor that it isn't, because I do not want to lie to you, give my son his father's position and let him take care of his mother at the same time, and meanwhile, let the father be free to dig the earth as he pleases.</t5654> <t5655>That is, Mr. Lorry—added Lapa, wiping the sweat from his forehead with the back of his hand,—what I wish to offer you.</t5655>
<t5656>—Quiet, Jeremías! Quiet, and don't say another word!</t5656> <t5657>Who knows if I will decide to treat you as I have until now, if with actions, not words, you show me your repentance.</t5657> <t5658>Words, I do not want them; they do not convince me.</t5658>
<t5659>Carton and Barsad left at that moment.</t5659>
<t5660>—Goodbye, Barsad—said the first;—we have an understanding.</t5660> <t5661>Have no fear of me.</t5661>
<t5662>He took a seat next to Lorry, who asked him.</t5662>
<t5663>—What have they done?</t5663>
<t5664>—Not much; if the prisoner's fate becomes uncertain, they will allow me to visit him; nothing more.</t5664>
<t5665>Lorry's discouragement deepened.</t5665>
<t5666>—I can do no more—replied Carton.</t5666><t5667>—Asking too much would be equivalent to sending that man to the guillotine, and, as he very well said, no greater misfortune could befall him even if we betrayed him.</t5667> <t5668>Let us be thankful for the precariousness of his position, for otherwise, we would have achieved nothing.</t5668>
<t5669>—But reaching him, in the event that he is condemned, is not saving him—objected Lorry.</t5669>
<t5670>—I never said I would save him—replied Carton.</t5670>
<t5671>Lorry's eyes gradually sought the fire burning in the fireplace.</t5671> <t5672>The pain caused by the second imprisonment of the husband of the girl he loved so much drained all his energy.</t5672> <t5673>He was no longer a young man, despite his many years; he was an old man crushed by anxiety.</t5673> <t5674>The tears stored in his chest rose to his eyes and rolled silently down his wrinkled cheeks.</t5674>
<t5675>—You have a great heart and are a loyal friend to your friends—said Carton with a disturbed voice.</t5675><t5676>—Forgive me if I have been the bearer of news that has affected you so painfully.</t5676> <t5677>It would be impossible for me to see my father cry and remain calm, and I swear to you that I respect your pain no less than I would respect my father's.</t5677>
<t5678>So much respect, so much interest, so much feeling was in the tone and expression of the words that are transcribed, that Lorry, who had not had the opportunity to appreciate the good side of Carton, experienced one of the greatest surprises of his life.</t5678> <t5679>He silently extended a hand to his interlocutor, who shook it warmly.</t5679>
<t5680>—Returning to poor Darnay—replied Carton,—I will say that it is not convenient for you to speak to your wife about the conference we just had, nor about what I have obtained from the spy.</t5680> <t5681>She could not reach the dungeon, and if she knew that I was going, she might think that my intention was to provide her husband with the means to advance the execution of the sentence.</t5681>
<t5682>Lorry had not thought of it, who upon hearing the previous words, quickly turned his eyes towards Carton, as if to ascertain whether what he did not want Lucía to think was precisely what he had in mind.</t5682>
<t5683>—Perhaps she would think that—added Carton,—and she might suspect a thousand other things, each of which would be an added torture to those already besieging her.</t5683> <t5684>Do not even speak to her about me.</t5684> <t5685>As I told you upon arriving in Paris, I will not see her; it is best that I do not see her.</t5685> <t5686>Whatever I can do for her, I will do better by not seeing her.</t5686> <t5687>Are you going to visit her now?</t5687> <t5688>Go as soon as possible, yes, for tonight she must be in despair.</t5688>
<t5689>—I'm going right now.</t5689>
<t5690>—Which makes me very happy.</t5690> <t5691>He loves you very much and has limitless confidence in you.</t5691> <t5692>How is he now?</t5692>
<t5693>—Swimming in a dreadful sea of anxieties, but beautiful as always.</t5693>
<t5694>—Ah!</t5694>
<t5695>It was a deep, long exclamation, similar to a groan, to a stifled sob.</t5695> <t5696>Lorry's eyes turned towards Carton's quickly enough to catch, while the latter's were fixed on the fire in the fireplace, the fleeting passage of either a light or a shadow; the elderly gentleman would not have dared to specify which it was.</t5696>
<t5697>—Have you already finished the task that brought you here?—asked Carton after a few brief seconds.</t5697>
<t5698>—Yes.</t5698> <t5699>As I was telling you last night, when Lucía arrived so unexpectedly, I have done everything that could be done.</t5699> <t5700>I only hoped to see you safe from danger and happy before leaving Paris.</t5700> <t5701>I was planning to leave very soon; but...</t5701>
<t5702>Both remained silent.</t5702>
<t5703>—Long is the book of his life, Mr. Lorry, isn't it?—asked Carton, undoubtedly just to say something.</t5703>
<t5704>—I have turned seventy-eight years old.</t5704>
<t5705>—Seventy-eight well-spent years; seventy-eight years during which he has been useful to his fellow men and respected by them; eh?</t5705>
<t5706>—Almost since I can remember, I have been involved in business; without exaggeration, I can say that, since I was a boy, I have been a businessman.</t5706>
<t5707>—His diligence has earned him an enviable position.</t5707> <t5708>How many will miss him when he leaves that position vacant!</t5708>
<t5709>"Don't believe it," replied Lorry, shaking his head. "Who would shed a tear for the memory of an old and lonely bachelor like me?"</t5709>
<t5710>—Don't say that!</t5710> <t5711>Won't she cry for you?</t5711> <t5712>Won't your daughter cry?</t5712>
<t5713>—Yes... yes... They will cry... Thank God!</t5713> <t5714>Excuse me; I didn't know what I was saying.</t5714>
<t5715>—It is a comfort that well deserves to be thanked to God for; isn't it true?</t5715>
<t5716>—A lot, yes... agreed.</t5716>
<t5717>—If tonight you could truthfully say the following words to yourself: "I have not managed to earn anyone's affection, esteem, gratitude, or respect; I have not succeeded in awakening echoes of sympathy in any human heart, I have done nothing good, nothing useful to my fellow men, nothing worthy of being remembered," your seventy-eight years of age would be seventy-eight thousand years of remorse; isn't that true?</t5717>
<t5718>—You are right, Carton; I think I would never get tired of cursing them.</t5718>
<t5719>Carton fixed his gaze on the fire once again, remained thoughtful for a long time, and finally said:</t5719>
<t5720>—I would like to ask you another question; when you remember your childhood, do you find it too distant?</t5720> <t5721>Does it seem to you that a lot of time has passed since the happy days when you sat on your sweet mother's knees?</t5721>
<t5722>Lorry, with a tone of voice made uncertain by the effect of the emotion that overwhelmed him, replied:</t5722>
<t5723>—Twenty years ago, yes; today, no.</t5723> <t5724>What happens to me is like someone traveling in a circle; they start by moving away from the starting point, but as they reach the end, they get closer and closer to the beginning.</t5724> <t5725>Often today, tender memories long dormant awaken in my heart, often I see my saintly mother, so young, so beautiful... my mother very young and I very old... often I remember incidents from life that occurred when the world was not as real to me as it is today, nor had faults taken root in me.</t5725>
<t5726>—I understand—exclaimed Carton, blushing deeply.</t5726>
<t5727>—And those memories, far from leaving a bitter taste, will be pleasant for you, right?</t5727>
<t5728>—Indeed; they give me a feeling of sweet sorrow.</t5728>
<t5729>Carton helped his interlocutor put on the overcoat.</t5729>
<t5730>—You, on the other hand, are very young—replied Lorry, returning to the same topic.</t5730>
<t5731>—Yes... I am not old; but my youthful paths were never the ones that lead to old age.</t5731>
<t5732>—Are you going out?—asked Lorry.</t5732>
<t5733>—I will accompany you to the door of your house.</t5733> <t5734>You already know my restless nature and my wandering habits, so if I spend many hours roaming aimlessly through those streets without returning home, rest assured, I will reappear if not today, then tomorrow.</t5734> <t5735>Do you plan to attend the trial hearing tomorrow?</t5735>
<t5736>—With great pain in my soul, I will have to attend.</t5736>
<t5737>—I will be there, but among the audience.</t5737> <t5738>My spy will find me a seat... Would you like to take my arm?</t5738>
<t5739>Arm in arm, they went down the stairs and out into the street.</t5739> <t5740>Minutes later, they arrived in front of Dr. Manette's house, where they parted ways.</t5740> <t5741>Lorry entered the house, and Carton walked away but only for a short time, as moments later, he returned to stand by the closed door.</t5741>
<t5742>—She goes out this way every day—Carton said to himself;—she takes that direction...</t5742> <t5743>How many times must she have stepped on those stones!...</t5743> <t5744>I will follow her steps!</t5744>
<t5745>The city clocks were striking ten at night when Carton ended his walk in front of the grim walls of La Force prison.</t5745> <t5746>A wood sawyer, after closing his workshop, was calmly smoking his pipe in front of his establishment.</t5746>
<t5747>—Good evening, citizen—said Carton, noticing that the sawyer was giving him inquisitive looks.</t5747>
<t5748>—Good evening, citizen.</t5748>
<t5749>—How is the Republic doing?</t5749>
<t5750>—I suppose you are referring to the Guillotine...</t5750> <t5751>It's not doing badly.</t5751> <t5752>Today sixty-three; we won't take long to reach a hundred per day.</t5752> <t5753>Sansón and his assistants complain that the work is excessive, that their strength is running out... Ha, ha, ha!</t5753> <t5754>How funny good Sansón is!</t5754> <t5755>Have you ever seen a busier barber in your life?</t5755>
<t5756>—Do you see him often...?</t5756>
<t5757>—Shaving?</t5757> <t5758>Every day...</t5758> <t5759>What a barber!</t5759> <t5760>Have you ever seen him in action?</t5760>
<t5761>—Never.</t5761>
<t5762>—Well, don't forget to go see him when he has work to do.</t5762> <t5763>It's a delight to watch him work...</t5763> <t5764>Just imagine, citizen; today, sixty-three in less than two hours...</t5764> <t5765>In less than two hours, word of honor!</t5765>
<t5766>Carton was so repulsed by the relish with which the sawyer described the executioner's tasks that he turned his back to avoid strangling him, as was his most fervent desire.</t5766>
<t5767>—But you are not English, even though you dress like an Englishman, right?—asked the sawyer.</t5767>
<t5768>—I am English—replied Carton, turning his head.</t5768>
<t5769>—Well, you speak like a true Frenchman.</t5769>
<t5770>—I was a student here.</t5770>
<t5771>—Ah...! Almost French, then.</t5771> <t5772>Good night, Englishman.</t5772>
<t5773>—Good evening, citizen.</t5773>
<t5774>—Don't forget to go see our friend Samson.</t5774>
<t5775>Carton moved away, but he had not gone far from the sawyer's workshop when he stopped under a streetlamp and wrote a few words with a pencil on a piece of paper.</t5775> <t5776>Then, crossing a number of dark and dirty streets with the determined step of someone who knows exactly where they are going, he stopped in front of a drugstore, whose door the druggist was closing at that moment.</t5776>
<t5777>After bidding goodnight to the druggist, whose appearance was as dirty and repugnant as the shop itself, he placed on the counter the piece of paper on which he had written with a pencil a short while ago.</t5777>
<t5778>—Damn!—exclaimed the druggist.</t5778><t5779>—Hee, hee, hee!</t5779> <t5780>Is it for you, citizen?</t5780>
<t5781>—For me.</t5781>
<t5782>—Will you be careful to keep them separate, citizen?</t5782> <t5783>Do you know the consequences of mixing them?</t5783>
<t5784>—Perfectly.</t5784>
<t5785>The druggist prepared some papers, which Carton put in the inner pocket of his frock coat.</t5785> <t5786>He paid the amount, and without further words, went out to the street.</t5786>
<t5787>—For tonight, I have nothing left to do—he murmured, raising his head.</t5787><t5788>—Tomorrow we will continue...</t5788> <t5789>It is impossible for me to sleep.</t5789>
<t5790>The tone with which Carton pronounced the previous words reflected neither indifference nor bewilderment, nor was there despair or defiance in them; his accent resonated with the resolution of a man who, after many years of traveling down twisted paths without a fixed direction or destination, finally enters one whose end is known to him.</t5790>
<t5791>Many years ago, when he stood out among the talented young people, among the students who promised great things, he accompanied his father to the cemetery.</t5791> <t5792>His mother had passed away much earlier.</t5792> <t5793>Well then; those solemn words that the priest read over the grave of the one who gave him life, words forgotten amidst the disorder of a licentious life, emerged powerfully in his memory as he walked through the sad and lonely streets tonight, under a sky covered with dark clouds.</t5793>
<t5794>"I am the resurrection and the Life; he who believes in Me, even if he dies, will live; and he who lives and believes in Me, will never die."</t5794>
<t5795>It would not have been difficult to find the mysterious force that evoked those memories from the depths of his soul, similar to the chain that pulls the rusted anchor from the depths of the silt, long embedded there, by simply noticing that he was walking alone and at night, through the streets of a city under the law of the guillotine, painfully recalling the sixty-three heads that had rolled that day, and thinking of the wretches who would die on the scaffold the next day, and the day after, and the day after that.</t5795> <t5796>However, he did not attempt to seek it; he merely repeated over and over the words that have been copied, and continued walking.</t5796>
<t5797>Focusing all his interest on the illuminated windows corresponding to rooms where people were preparing to rest, eager to forget during the brief hours of nighttime calm the horrors that surrounded them during the day, in the church towers, where divine services were no longer held, as popular revulsion had made priests the main target of their wrath, accusing them of being impostors, libertines, and thieves; in those sacred places, destined, according to the inscriptions placed above the doors, for eternal rest; in the dungeons, overflowing with prisoners, and in the streets, where people ran to meet a death already considered, by force of habit, so common and natural that even those in charge of handling the guillotine did not have their dreams disturbed by spectral apparitions; in short, with all his attention focused on the life of that city rushing headlong to death, Sydney Carton crossed the Seine looking for better-lit and more lively streets.</t5797>
<t5798>There were very few cars to be seen, for those who could afford the luxury of having them, knowing that using them was as much as requesting to be inscribed in the Book of Suspects, preferred to walk on foot, wearing red caps and the most ordinary shoes.</t5798> <t5799>The theaters, however, were full, and they began to empty at the hour when Carton strolled through the central streets where they were located.</t5799> <t5800>Next to the door of a theater, from which compact masses of cheerful people were emerging, singing as they headed to their homes, Carton saw a little girl, holding her mother's hand, looking for a spot that would allow her to cross the street without getting knee-deep in the mud.</t5800> <t5801>Carton took the little girl in his arms, carried her to the opposite sidewalk, and before the timid little angel let go of the arms that encircled his neck, he asked her to give him a kiss.</t5801>
<t5802>“I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes in Me, though he may die, he shall live; and whoever lives and believes in Me shall never die.”</t5802>
<t5803>Later in the night, when the tranquility in the streets was complete and the silence absolute, it seemed to him that the sound of his own footsteps modulated those sentences, which the breeze brought wrapped in its subtle whispers.</t5803> <t5804>Master of himself, calm, resolute, he frequently repeated them with his lips; but they always sounded in his ears.</t5804>
<t5805>And the night continued advancing while Carton, leaning over the parapet of the bridge, listened to the murmuring kisses of the river against the walls of the Island of Paris, and contemplated the picturesque confusion of buildings wrapped in gray shadows, over which the dome of the cathedral, bathed in the whitish light of the moon, rose arrogantly.</t5805> <t5806>The day came.</t5806> <t5807>The night, with the moon and the stars, paled and died, and for a few minutes, it seemed that all of creation fell under the yellowish scepter of Death.</t5807>
<t5808>The river's current, rapid, impetuous, deep, seemed to him like a loving friend.</t5808> <t5809>He started walking along its banks, moving away from the city's bustle.</t5809> <t5810>He fell asleep on the shore; when he woke up, he continued walking for a few more minutes, his eyes fixed on a whirlpool spinning vertiginously, until the current swallowed him and dragged him to the sea.</t5810>
<t5811>—Like me!—murmured Carton.</t5811>
<t5812>When he arrived home, Lorry had already left.</t5812> <t5813>Carton did not ask where he had gone, as with little effort of imagination he could guess it.</t5813> <t5814>He had a small cup of coffee, washed and got ready, and went without delay to the Tribunal.</t5814> <t5815>There he found Lorry, there he found Dr. Manette, there he found her, sitting next to her father.</t5815>
<t5816>When Charles Darnay appeared, Lucie directed a look at him so encouraging, so full of boundless love and tender compassion, that it brought blood to the prisoner's cheeks, brightened his gaze, and lifted his heart.</t5816> <t5817>If anyone had had their eyes on Sydney Carton, they would have noticed that the look, although not directed at him, had the same effect on him as it did on the prisoner.</t5817>
<t5818>Before that unjust tribunal, which had begun by banishing order in its proceedings, it was perfectly useless for any accused person to attempt to be heard; it would not have been worth bringing the Revolution to not simultaneously scatter all the laws, regulations, and ceremonies to the four winds, to not abolish once and for all the social order that the world had so monstrously abused, to not deny the accused the right to justify themselves.</t5818>
<t5819>The Jury was from the very first moments the focus of all eyes.</t5819> <t5820>It was composed of the same resolute patriots, the same excellent republicans who formed it the day before, the same who would form it the next day.</t5820> <t5821>Among them stood out a man with a repulsive face, a fierce cannibal in every sense of the word, an individual who drank blood, bathed in blood, and breathed blood.</t5821> <t5822>It was Santiago Tercero, the one we met in the San Antonio neighborhood.</t5822> <t5823>The others resembled a pack of dogs eager to tear apart the prey.</t5823>
<t5824>All eyes were fixed on the five jurors and the public prosecutor, who spoke, more or less, in the following terms:</t5824>
<t5825>—Carlos Evrémonde, also called Darnay.</t5825> <t5826>Yesterday he was released, and on the same day he was accused again and re-arrested.</t5826> <t5827>Last night he was informed of the charges brought against him.</t5827> <t5828>He is charged with being an enemy of the Republic, an aristocrat, a member of a family of tyrants, a member of a proscribed race, who abused his privileges, now happily abolished, oppressing the people in the most villainous manner.</t5828> <t5829>Carlos Evrémonde, also called Darnay, guilty of the mentioned crimes, is a dead man in the eyes of the Law.</t5829> <t5830>His head rightfully belongs to the executioner.</t5830>
<t5831>—Is the accusation against the defendant public or secret?—asked the president.</t5831>
<t5832>—Who made it?</t5832>
<t5833>—Three people.</t5833> <t5834>Ernesto Defarge, innkeeper of San Antonio.</t5834>
<t5835>—Very well.</t5835>
<t5836>—Teresa Defarge, wife of the aforementioned.</t5836>
<t5837>—Perfectly.</t5837>
<t5838>—Alejandro Manette, doctor.</t5838>
<t5839>This last name raised a storm of deafening shouts in the room.</t5839> <t5840>In the midst of the tumult, the doctor was seen to rise, pale as a corpse and trembling like a leaf.</t5840>
<t5841>—President—he shouted,—I indignantly protest against the vile lie that has just been uttered here.</t5841> <t5842>I could not have denounced my daughter's husband, and the Court knows very well that the accused is my son-in-law.</t5842> <t5843>My daughter, and the people who are dear to her, are worth a thousand times more to me than my own life.</t5843> <t5844>Where is the impostor who dares to claim that I have denounced my daughter's husband?</t5844> <t5845>Where is the false patriot who dares to lie so shamelessly?</t5845>
<t5846>—Calm yourself, citizen Manette.</t5846> <t5847>To disrespect the authority of the Tribunal would be tantamount to stepping outside the Law.</t5847> <t5848>You have said that there is something worth a thousand times more than your life; and I do not know that for a good patriot there is anything worth as much as the Republic.</t5848>
<t5849>Frenzied applause rewarded the president's reply.</t5849> <t5850>He, after imposing silence with the force of bell rings, continued passionately:</t5850>
<t5851>—If the Republic demanded the sacrifice of your own daughter, your duty would be to sacrifice her.</t5851> <t5852>Let's continue, and silence.</t5852>
<t5853>The doctor Manette collapsed into the chair.</t5853> <t5854>His lips trembled, and his eyes looked around in terror.</t5854> <t5855>The cannibal-faced jury rubbed their hands with visible relish.</t5855>
<t5856>Once silence was restored, Defarge presented himself, who gave a succinct account of the doctor's captivity and release; he stated that he had been his servant, and described the condition in which the captive was found when he was handed over.</t5856> <t5857>After the story was finished, the Tribunal addressed him with the following questions:</t5857>
<t5858>—Did you render good services in the storming of the Bastille, citizen?</t5858>
<t5859>—I believe so.</t5859>
<t5860>—You were one of the best patriots!—shouted a woman, overcome with enthusiasm—Why not say it like that?</t5860> <t5861>That day you were an artilleryman, you fought with fury, and you were the first to enter the damned fortress after it fell into the hands of the people.</t5861> <t5862>Patriots... believe me, because I tell the truth!</t5862>
<t5863>The one who had just spoken was La Venganza.</t5863> <t5864>The applause from the crowd was deafening.</t5864> <t5865>The President rang the bell, but La Venganza, incited by the mobs, howled:</t5865>
<t5866>—I don't feel like being quiet!</t5866> <t5867>I laugh at the bell and at whoever rings it!</t5867>
<t5868>Finally, he fell silent when his strength was exhausted.</t5868>
<t5869>—Report to the Tribunal what you did inside the Bastille, citizen.</t5869>
<t5870>—I knew—replied Defarge, looking at his wife who was staring at him from a short distance with her eyes—that the captive I speak of had been buried in a cell they called One Hundred and Five, North Tower.</t5870> <t5871>The secret was revealed to me by him, for while he stayed in my house, making shoes, he did not know that he had any other name than One Hundred and Five, North Tower.</t5871> <t5872>On the day of the storming of the Bastille, while I was firing my cannon, I decided to inspect the cell in question as soon as the fortress fell into our hands.</t5872> <t5873>It fell; and I immediately went up to the mentioned dungeon, along with a companion who is on the jury, and a jailer who took charge of guiding us.</t5873> <t5874>I inspected it very carefully, and in a hole in the wall, concealed behind a stone that had been removed and replaced, I found a written paper.</t5874> <t5875>This is the written paper.</t5875> <t5876>I have examined several writings of Doctor Manette, and the handwriting on this paper is in Doctor Manette's own hand.</t5876> <t5877>I hand this paper, written in Doctor Manette's own hand, to the President.</t5877>
<t5878>—Let it be read.</t5878>
<t5879>The document, read in the midst of a sepulchral silence, while the convict looked lovingly at his wife, and she looked now at him, now at her father, and Dr. Manette did not take his eyes off the reader, and Mrs. Defarge fixed hers insistently on the prisoner, and Defarge did not take his eyes off his wife, and everyone in the room watched the doctor who saw no one, said thus:</t5879>
<t5880>X.</t5880>
<t5881>THE SUBSTANCE OF THE SHADOW</t5881>
<t5882>"I, Alejandro Manette, unfortunate doctor, native of Beauvais, and resident of Paris, write this painful document in my horrendous cell in the Bastille in the last month of the year 1767."</t5882> <t5883>"I write it taking advantage of moments that I steal from vigilance and overcoming immense difficulties."</t5883> <t5884>"My purpose is to hide it inside the wall of my tomb, where through hard work I have managed to open a hole."</t5884> <t5885>"Perhaps some merciful hand will find it when I and my misfortunes have passed into the world of oblivion."</t5885>
<t5886>"I trace these lines with the rust I have scraped from the moldy bars of the grille mixed with blood from my veins, in the last month of the tenth year of my captivity."</t5886> <t5887>"In my chest, there is not a single atom of hope left."</t5887> <t5888>"Terrible phenomena that I have observed in myself announce that very soon reason will also abandon me, but I solemnly declare that at this moment I am in full possession of my mental faculties... that my memory is exact and detailed, that I write the truth, and that I am ready to vouch for the veracity of my words, whether they are read by men someday or condemned to eternal secrecy, before the Eternal Judge whose gaze reads into the depths of hearts."</t5888>
<t5889>One night during the fourth week of December (I believe it was the twenty-second of the month) in the year 1757, I found myself walking in a secluded area of the promenade that borders the Seine, an hour's distance from my home, located on the street of the Faculty of Medicine, when I saw a carriage approaching from behind, drawn by two horses, at a gallop.</t5889> <t5890>As I stepped aside to let the carriage pass and avoid being run over, a head appeared in the window, and a voice commanded the coachman to stop.</t5890>
<t5891>"The carriage came to a halt as soon as the coachman could rein in the horses, and the same voice that had given the order to stop called me by my name."</t5891> <t5892>"The carriage did not stop in front of me, but at a distance sufficient for two gentlemen to have time to open the door and jump onto the path before I arrived, responding to the call."</t5892> <t5893>"I observed that both were perfectly cloaked in their capes and that they tried to conceal their faces."</t5893> <t5894>"When I reached their side and found them standing on either side of the door, I also noticed that both seemed to be of my age, perhaps younger, and that they resembled each other greatly in height, movements, voice, and (from the little I could see) even in their faces."</t5894>
<t5895>"—Are you Dr. Manette?—one of them asked me.</t5895>
<t5896>"—I am— I replied.</t5896>
<t5897>»—The doctor Manette, a native of Beauvais, a young and skilled physician and surgeon, who for the past one or two years has become a true notable in Paris?—interjected the other.</t5897>
<t5898>"—Gentlemen; I am, indeed, Doctor Manette, of whom you speak with excessive benevolence— I replied.</t5898>
<t5899>"—We have been to your house—replied the one who had spoken first,—and not having had the luck to find you, although we were fortunate enough to be told that you were probably walking around these places, we followed you driven by the hope of catching up with you."</t5899> <t5900>Would you be so kind as to get into the carriage?</t5900>
<t5901>"The tone of his voice was imperious; while the words he left recorded were exchanged, they moved in such a way that left me positioned between them and the car door, and moreover, they were armed and I was not."</t5901>
<t5902>"—I beg you to forgive me, gentlemen— I replied,—but it is my custom to ask who the people are who do me the honor of requesting my services and the nature of the case that makes my assistance necessary or convenient."</t5902>
<t5903>"The one who had spoken second replied to me:</t5903>
<t5904>"—Your clients, doctor, are people of high social standing."</t5904> <t5905>"As far as the nature of the case that necessitates your assistance is concerned, the confidence we have in your science and skill is a guarantee for us that you will understand it without the need for our explanations, which would surely be inadequate."</t5905> <t5906>"I believe what has been said is sufficient."</t5906> <t5907>"Would you be so kind as to mount?"</t5907>
<t5908>"I had no other recourse but to obey, and I did so without saying a word."</t5908> <t5909>Immediately, the two gentlemen followed me, with the one who entered last having picked up the stirrup.</t5909> <t5910>The carriage turned around and departed at a gallop.</t5910>
<t5911>"I record the conversation here exactly as it happened; I can assure you that I am repeating it verbatim, word for word."</t5911> <t5912>"I describe everything exactly as it took place, restraining my imagination and preventing it from wandering."</t5912> <t5913>"The ellipses that you find in my account mean that I am pausing the task for another occasion and that I am hiding the document in the designated hiding place..."</t5913>
<t5914>"The carriage passed through many streets, went through the North Barrier, and soon advanced along a road outside the city."</t5914> <t5915>"At two-thirds of a league from the Barrier (I didn't calculate the distance then, but I did when I traveled it again), the carriage left the main road, and moments later it stopped in front of a solitary house."</t5915> <t5916>"The three of us jumped to the ground and advanced along a soft path in a garden, covered with grass, in the center of which a fountain had once flowed, until we reached the door of the house."</t5916> <t5917>"We were granted entry as soon as the bell rang, and the one who opened the door received a terrible slap from one of my companions."</t5917>
<t5918>"I confess that the act did not catch my attention, as I was very accustomed to seeing men of the lower class being treated by the nobles with less regard than if they were dogs."</t5918> <t5919>"Once inside the house, I could observe that the resemblance between my two companions was so remarkable that I immediately took them for twin brothers."</t5919>
<t5920>"Since we jumped out of the carriage in front of the garden gate, which we found closed and was opened by one of the brothers, closing it again after we passed through, I had been hearing screams that originated from one of the upper rooms of the house."</t5920> <t5921>"They led me straight to the room from which the screams were coming, where I found a sick woman lying on the bed, suffering from a terrible brain fever."</t5921>
<t5922>"The patient was a woman of wonderful beauty and very young; surely she was no more than twenty years old."</t5922> <t5923>"Her beautiful hair was in such complete disarray that it saddened the spirit, and the patient's arms were bound with strips of cloth."</t5923> <t5924>"I observed that these strips were pieces of a gentleman's suit, on one of which I saw the coat of arms of a noble with the initial E."</t5924>
<t5925>“I made all these observations within a minute of having entered the room.</t5925> <t5926>It happened that the patient, whose agitation was dreadful, turned face down, one of the straps holding her got into her mouth, and I saw that she was in danger of suffocating.</t5926> <t5927>Naturally, I removed the strip, and that was when I discovered the little embroidered coat of arms on it.</t5927>
<t5928>"I turned the patient onto her back, placed my hand on her chest to calm her and make her stay still, and looked at her face."</t5928> <t5929>"Her gaze was horribly dilated, and her clenched lips were repeatedly shouting these words: 'My husband... my father... my brother.'"</t5929> <t5930>"Then she would count to twelve, remain silent for a few seconds listening with all the attention of her soul, and start shouting again 'My husband... my father... my brother,' and again count to twelve and again pause to listen."</t5930> <t5931>"There was not the slightest variation in her tone, gestures, or voice."</t5931>
<t5932>"—When did this state of affairs begin?—I asked.</t5932>
<t5933>"In order to distinguish between the two brothers, I will call one the elder brother and the other the younger, understanding by the elder the one who exercised greater authority."</t5933>
<t5934>"—Since last night at this time—replied the older brother.</t5934>
<t5935>"—Does she have a husband, father, and brother?"</t5935>
<t5936>»—He has a brother.</t5936>
<t5937>»—And am I not speaking with that brother at this very moment?</t5937>
<t5938>"—No—he replied with a tone of deep contempt.</t5938>
<t5939>»—Has anything related to the number twelve happened to her recently?»</t5939>
<t5940>"—With number twelve?—repeated the younger brother impatiently.</t5940>
<t5941>"—You can convince yourselves, gentlemen, of how uselessly you have brought me here, just as I am," I said, my hands still placed on the patient's chest.</t5941><t5942>"If I had known what was happening, I would have come equipped with what was necessary, whereas now we are wasting time miserably."</t5942><t5943>"In a place as isolated as this, it is not possible to find medicines."</t5943>
<t5944>"The older brother looked at the younger one, who replied in a haughty voice:</t5944>
<t5945>"—We have a first aid kit here."</t5945>
<t5946>»Moments later, he took it out of a cupboard and placed it on the table...</t5946>
<t5947>"I opened some jars, smelled them, and brought their caps to my lips."</t5947> <t5948>"If I had needed to administer any non-narcotic or non-toxic substance to the patient, I certainly wouldn't have medicated her with anything that the medicine cabinet contained."</t5948>
<t5949>"—Don't they inspire confidence in you?—asked the younger brother.</t5949>
<t5950>"—You can see, sir, that I am going to use them— I replied simply.</t5950>
<t5951>»Not without having to struggle with great difficulties, and after a long while, I managed to get the patient to take the dose of medicine that I deemed appropriate.</t5951> <t5952>Since my intention was to repeat the medication and observe the effects that the first dose had on the patient, I sat at the head of her bed.</t5952> <t5953>Sitting timidly and obviously shy in a corner, there was a woman who was taking care of her, married to one of the individuals from downstairs.</t5953> <t5954>The house was dirty, poorly maintained, and furnished, evident signs that they had occupied it very recently and that their intention was to stay there for a very short time.</t5954> <t5955>They had temporarily hung some drapes in front of the windows, undoubtedly to prevent the patient's screams from reaching the outside.</t5955> <t5956>She continued screaming as she had when I arrived, repeating the same words in the same order: «My husband... my father... my brother», and then counting up to twelve.</t5956> <t5957>Her convulsions were so violent that I did not deem it prudent to free her from the straps that restrained her, although I adjusted them to make them less bothersome.</t5957> <t5958>The crisis did not respond to the medication, but I observed that the pressure of my hand on the patient's chest had such an influence on her that after a few minutes she calmed down.</t5958> <t5959>However, it did not have the same effect on the screams, which continued with the regularity of a pendulum.</t5959>
<t5960>"I had been sitting by the bed for half an hour under the gaze of the two brothers when the elder said:</t5960>
<t5961>"—We have another patient."</t5961>
<t5962>"The news alarmed me, and I asked:</t5962>
<t5963>"—Is the case urgent?"</t5963>
<t5964>"—It would be better if you saw it with your own eyes—he replied to me in a negligent tone, taking a light...</t5964>
<t5965>"The second patient lay in a room situated at the back of the house, a room that was really nothing more than an attic placed above a stable."</t5965> <t5966>"Part of the attic had a very low roof and part did not."</t5966> <t5967>"Under the covered part, there was hay and straw stored, and the rest contained firewood and farming tools."</t5967> <t5968>"I remember all these details so well that it seems as if I am seeing them at this moment just as I saw them that night, despite being locked up for ten years in my cell in the Bastille."</t5968>
<t5969>"On a pile of hay and with his head resting on a pillow, lay a young man with a peasant-like appearance, a handsome face, and who could not have been more than seventeen years old."</t5969> <t5970>"He was lying on his back, with clenched teeth, his right hand clenched over his chest, and his gaze fixed on the ceiling."</t5970> <t5971>"I knelt beside him; and although I could not find the wound he had received, I immediately saw that he was dying from a wound caused by a sharp instrument."</t5971>
<t5972>"—I am a doctor, my poor friend— I said; —let me examine you."</t5972>
<t5973>"—I don't want to be recognized; leave me alone—he replied."</t5973>
<t5974>"The wound was located below his right hand, which took me no small effort and many attempts to separate."</t5974> <t5975>"It was a stab wound received twenty to twenty-four hours earlier, a mortal stab wound, even if all the aid of science had been provided the second it was inflicted."</t5975> <t5976>"He was dying in spurts."</t5976> <t5977>"I searched with my gaze for the older brother's, and observed that he was watching the wounded boy with the same indifference with which he would watch a bird, a hare, or a wounded rabbit."</t5977> <t5978>"It was clearly noticeable that he did not see a human being in the boy."</t5978>
<t5979>"—Who caused you that wound, sir?—I asked.</t5979>
<t5980>"—Bah!"</t5980> <t5981>"Why talk about a miserable servant... a dog?"</t5981> <t5982>"He forced my brother to fight against him, and fell under his sword as if he had been a knight."</t5982>
<t5983>"In the tone of the reply, there was neither a shadow of pity, nor a shadow of sorrow, nor a shadow of remorse."</t5983>
<t5984>"The eyes of the dying man turned towards the one who had just spoken, then fixed on me."</t5984>
<t5985>"—Doctor—he told me;—those nobles are very haughty; but we too, the miserable dogs, have our pride.</t5985> <t5986>They rob us, they loot us, they outrage us, they vilify us, they beat us, but all of that is not enough to drown our haughtiness.</t5986> <t5987>She... have you seen her, doctor?</t5987>
<t5988>The cries of the unfortunate woman reached there, albeit very muffled by the distance.</t5988> <t5989>The wounded man referred to the one who gave them as if she had been by his side.</t5989>
<t5990>"—I have seen her, yes— I replied.</t5990>
<t5991>"—She is my sister, doctor.</t5991> <t5992>Those nobles may have had shameful rights over the modesty and virtue of our sisters for many years; but among us, there are still good girls, girls who know how to resist their violence.</t5992> <t5993>I know it, and I have heard my father affirm it as such.</t5993> <t5994>My sister is one of them.</t5994> <t5995>She had a romantic relationship with a young man, also good and honest, a vassal of this noble who is there... we were all his vassals...</t5995> <t5996>The other is his brother, the vilest representative of his despicable race.</t5996>
<t5997>"The unfortunate man had to make truly superhuman efforts to be able to speak; but if he lacked physical strength, he had an abundance of spiritual strength, and he spoke with extraordinary fortitude."</t5997>
<t5998>"—That man over there robbed us with the coldness and indifference with which those beings of a nature superior to the human rob us, the common dogs...</t5998> <t5999>he stripped us without compassion, forced us to work without paying us, to take our wheat to his mill, to feed his poultry with our crops, but imposing the death penalty on anyone who dared to take one of them, he plundered and robbed us to such an extent that if ever, by God's mercy, we had a scrap of meat to put in our mouths, we ate it terrified, first barricading the doors and windows of our poor houses, so that his people wouldn't see it and steal it from us.</t5999> <t6000>I repeat that they stripped us in such a way, harassed us in such a way, made life so impossible for us, that a thousand times I heard my father say that it was an immense misfortune for us to bring a child into the world, and that we should pray to God to condemn all the women of our caste to sterility, so that it would be extinguished once and for all.</t6000>
<t6001>"Never had I witnessed the explosion of the feelings of the unfortunate oppressed; I supposed, yes, that deep in their souls they harbored immense amounts of hatred against their oppressors; but their outburst was a new spectacle for me until that night."</t6001>
<t6002>"—Doctor, my sister got married, despite everything.</t6002> <t6003>Her poor fiancé was in bad health at the time, and my sister married him to care for him in our cabin... our kennel, as that monster in front of us would say.</t6003> <t6004>She had been married for only a few weeks when she had the misfortune of being seen by that man's brother; he liked her, and with the greatest naturalness in the world, he asked his older brother to lend her to him.</t6004> <t6005>What did it matter that she was married?</t6005> <t6006>Husbands are such insignificant things among us!...</t6006> <t6007>The older brother agreed without any inconvenience, but my sister was good and virtuous, and moreover, she detested her admirer as much as I do.</t6007> <t6008>What do you think the two brothers did then to get my sister's husband to exert all his influence over her until she was forced to yield to their vile desires?</t6008>
<t6009>"The boy's eyes, fixed until then on mine, slowly turned towards those of the nobleman, in whose face it was not difficult for me to read the truth of the charges made against him."</t6009> <t6010>Even here, in the interior of the Bastille's tomb where I have been for so many years, I believe I can see the two kinds of pride, perfectly distinct, reflected in the two faces: indifference and coldness breathed from the gentleman's; furious desires for revenge from the peasant boy's.</t6010>
<t6011>"—You know, doctor, that one of the rights of those nobles consists of harnessing us, who are miserable dogs, to their carts and forcing us to pull."</t6011> <t6012>"Well, they harnessed my sister's husband, properly geared, to a cart, and forced him to pull it."</t6012> <t6013>"You know, doctor, that among the rights of those nobles is the right to force us to spend the nights on their lands, imposing silence on the frogs so that their croaking does not disturb their noble sleep; my sister's husband spent the nights in the open and the days pulling the cart."</t6013> <t6014>"He did not let himself be persuaded... No!"</t6014> <t6015>"One day, when they freed him from the harness and dismissed him to go eat... if he could find something, he exhaled twelve sobs, one for each chime of the clock—it was noon—and died in my sister's arms."</t6015>
<t6016>»Only the desire to explain the grievance received sustained life in that dying body.</t6016> <t6017>Searching in his determination for energies he could not find in his body, he pushed away the shadows of death that invaded him and pressed his wound, through which his life was escaping, harder than ever.</t6017>
<t6018>"—With the death of my sister's husband, with the authorization of this man, and even with his material support, his brother violently took possession of the poor widow, whom he needed for his pleasures, for his momentary amusement."</t6018> <t6019>"I stumbled upon her on the road when they were taking her away."</t6019> <t6020>"I brought the news to our house, and upon hearing it, my father's heart shattered into a thousand pieces."</t6020> <t6021>"Immediately, I accompanied my younger sister—I have two... to a place where she would be out of that man's reach, to a place where she would not be his vassal."</t6021> <t6022>"I then returned, followed that noble's brother, and last night I confronted him, I, a despicable dog, but with a sword in my hand..."</t6022> <t6023>"Where is the window?... Wasn't there a window here?"</t6023>
<t6024>»Life was abandoning him, and with life, the light.</t6024> <t6025>I cast my eyes around and noticed that the hay and straw covering the ground were trampled and crushed, as if a fierce struggle had taken place there.</t6025>
<t6026>"—My sister heard me and came running.</t6026> <t6027>I told her not to come closer until her infamous abductor was dead.</t6027> <t6028>He threw some coins at me, and then struck my face with his whip; but I, despite being a despicable dog, slapped him until he was forced to draw his sword.</t6028> <t6029>Let him now break the blade of a sword stained with the blood of a villain, let him shatter it into a thousand pieces, it will always be true that he had to draw it to defend his life, and if he wounded me, it was by resorting to all his skill!</t6029>
<t6030>Moments before, I had seen pieces of a sword scattered on the ground; it was a knight's sword.</t6030> <t6031>A little further on, on the straw, there was another old sword, a soldier's sword.</t6031>
<t6032>"—Help me up, doctor, help me up; where is that man?"</t6032>
<t6033>»—He is not here— I replied, holding the dying man, believing he was referring to his brother.</t6033>
<t6034>"—Of course!"</t6034> <t6035>"With all his noble arrogance, he is afraid of me!"</t6035> <t6036>"And the man who was here?"</t6036> <t6037>"Turn me towards him... I want to see him!"</t6037>
<t6038>"I did so, resting the boy's head on my knee; but he, with all his energies revived for a moment, stood up, forcing me to do the same to support him."</t6038>
<t6039>"—Marquis!—he shouted, with wide eyes and raising his arm.</t6039><t6040>—The day will come when all men will have to give a strict account of their actions; for that day I summon you and all of yours, from the first to the last of your cursed race, to answer for your crimes.</t6040> <t6041>Let this cross that I stamp with blood on your face be a testimony of my summons.</t6041> <t6042>For the day when all men will have to give a strict account of their actions, I also summon your brother, the vilest of a vile and miserable race, to answer for his separately; on his face I stamp this other cross with my blood, as a testimony of my summons.</t6042>
<t6043>»Twice he brought his hand to the bloody wound on his chest and with his index finger traced two crosses in the air.</t6043> <t6044>He remained for a few seconds with his index finger rigid, raised, and then fell dead...</t6044>
<t6045>"When I returned to the room where I had left the sick woman, I found her delirious as I had left her, repeating the same words in the same order as always."</t6045> <t6046>"I immediately guessed that the crisis would last many hours and that it would probably end with her death."</t6046>
<t6047>"I repeated the medicines and sat by the bed, where I remained until the night was already very advanced."</t6047> <t6048>"The cries of the sick woman continued with the same intensity, in the same order, without varying a single word."</t6048> <t6049>"My husband... my father... my brother... One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve."</t6049>
<t6050>»Thirty-six hours had passed since I first saw her, and the condition of the patient had not changed at all.</t6050> <t6051>I was sitting at the head of her bed when the crisis began to subside.</t6051> <t6052>The screams ceased, the tremors ended, and shortly after she was left lethargic, as if dead.</t6052>
<t6053>»I then called the nurse to help me place her properly in bed and arrange her clothes, torn in a thousand places, and then I realized that the unfortunate woman was pregnant, and I lost the little hope I had of saving her.</t6053>
<t6054>"—Is he dead yet?—asked the Marquis, who had just entered the room after a horseback ride.</t6054>
<t6055>"—She hasn't died, but she seems dead—I replied."</t6055>
<t6056>"—What resilience these villains have!—he exclaimed, looking at her with curiosity.</t6056>
<t6057>"—Sorrows and despair often endure the unspeakable— I replied.</t6057>
<t6058>"My words initially provoked his laughter, but then he furrowed his brow.</t6058> <t6059>He pushed a chair towards me with his foot, told the nurse to leave us alone, and said in a low voice:</t6059>
<t6060>"—Doctor, seeing my brother in the difficulty he was in, I advised him to seek you out."</t6060> <t6061>"You enjoy an enviable reputation, but you still have to build your fortune, and I suppose that what affects your interests cannot be indifferent to you."</t6061> <t6062>"You are witnessing things that can be seen, but never spoken of."</t6062>
<t6063>"I pretended to pay attention to the patient's breathing and did not respond."</t6063>
<t6064>"—Do you grant me the honor of listening to me, doctor?"</t6064>
<t6065>"—In my profession, sir, any information given to the doctor regarding the patients is understood to be confidential," I replied, avoiding any commitment, as what I had heard and seen filled my soul with misgivings.</t6065>
<t6066>"The breathing of the unfortunate woman was becoming so difficult that I had to search for signs of life in her pulse and the beats of her heart."</t6066> <t6067>"For this, I had to get up from the chair, and when I sat back down, I found myself face to face with the two brothers..."</t6067>
<t6068>"I struggle to write with horrible difficulties.</t6068> <t6069>First of all, the cold is unbearable, and, on the other hand, I have a well-founded fear that they will find out that I am writing, in which case they would lock me in an underground dungeon where not a thread of light reaches, so I consider it prudent to shorten my narration as much as possible.</t6069> <t6070>My memory could not be fresher; I retain in it all the details, all the words that were exchanged between me and the two brothers.</t6070>
<t6071>»For the span of a week, the sick woman was between life and death; closer to the latter than to the former.</t6071> <t6072>Towards the end of the week, I managed to understand some words she said to me, by placing my ear to her lips.</t6072> <t6073>She asked me where she was, and I told her; she wanted to know who I was, and I satisfied her curiosity; but it was in vain that I asked her for her last name; her head fell onto the pillow, and she kept her secret, as her brother had before her.</t6073>
<t6074>"I had no opportunity to ask her new questions until after I informed the brothers that the sick woman was dying and would not live another day."</t6074> <t6075>"Until then, although neither of them let themselves be seen by the sick woman, sometimes one, sometimes the other, they were invariably found behind a curtain drawn at the head of the bed; but when I communicated my prognosis to them, it seemed they no longer cared if I spoke with the dying woman; they no longer tried to prevent the confidences that the one who was about to leave the world might make to someone who... was probably in the same situation."</t6075>
<t6076>"I always observed that the fact that the younger brother (I will continue to call him that) had crossed swords with a boy, and moreover a peasant and commoner, deeply wounded the pride of the two."</t6076> <t6077>"What seemed to affect them was not the misfortunes they had caused, but the thought that the aforementioned incident degraded the family and placed it in a highly ridiculous situation."</t6077> <t6078>"Countless times I caught looks in the younger brother's eyes that overflowed with hatred, although he apparently treated me with greater refinement than the elder."</t6078> <t6079>"Nor was it hidden from me that for the latter, I was an annoying obstacle."</t6079>
<t6080>"My patient died at ten o'clock at night."</t6080> <t6081>"I was alone by her side, she bowed her youthful head, her misfortunes on earth ended forever."</t6081>
<t6082>"On the ground floor of the house, the brothers were waiting."</t6082>
<t6083>"—Has he finally died?—asked the elder, upon seeing me enter.</t6083>
<t6084>»—He just died— I replied.</t6084>
<t6085>"—Be it well, brother—he replied, turning towards the younger one.</t6085>
<t6086>"They had already offered me money before, which I did not accept, saying that we would finalize that detail at the end."</t6086> <t6087>The older brother handed me a cartridge of gold coins, which I received from his hand, but then left on the table.</t6087> <t6088>I had thought over the matter, and from that reflection came the determined purpose not to accept anything.</t6088>
<t6089>"—Excuse me— I said; —given the circumstances, I must not accept anything."</t6089>
<t6090>"The brothers exchanged a look, gave me a nod, which I returned with another, mounted their horses, and left...."</t6090>
<t6091>"I feel tired, exhausted, worn out...</t6091> <t6092>I can't even read what my bony hand has written."</t6092>
<t6093>»The next morning, very early, they brought to my house the cartridge of gold coins, placed inside a small box addressed to my name.</t6093> <t6094>I, meanwhile, after long meditations, had already resolved the code of conduct I was to follow.</t6094> <t6095>I decided to write that very day to the Minister, recounting the history of the two cases in which I had intervened and detailing the place where they occurred; in a word: to send him a detailed report, albeit with a private character.</t6095> <t6096>I knew how far the influences at the Court reached, the privileges and immunities enjoyed by the nobles were no secret to me, and, as a consequence, I supposed that my letter would yield no result; but even so, I wanted to ease my conscience.</t6096> <t6097>I decided not to reveal my secret to anyone, not even to my wife, and I made this clear in the letter addressed to the Minister.</t6097> <t6098>I did not believe that I was threatened by any danger; but I supposed that others would be, if I compromised them by making them privy to the secret I possessed.</t6098>
<t6099>"I was so busy that day that I couldn't finish the letter until after nightfall."</t6099> <t6100>The next morning, I left the bed earlier than usual.</t6100> <t6101>It was the last day of the year.</t6101> <t6102>I had just put the finishing touches on the letter when I was informed that a lady was waiting to see me...</t6102>
<t6103>"At times I consider myself more incapable of completing the task I have imposed on myself."</t6103> <t6104>"The cold is so unbearable, the light so scarce, the paralysis of my faculties so complete, the darkness of my soul so horrible!..."</t6104>
<t6105>»She was a young, kind, and beautiful lady, but marked by the bony finger of death.</t6105> <t6106>I found her in a state of intense agitation.</t6106> <t6107>She told me she was the wife of the Marquis of Evrémonde.</t6107> <t6108>I connected the title of Marquis that the dying boy had given to the older brother with the initial I discovered on the crested tie, and with such information at hand, it was not difficult for me to guess that the man from whom I had parted and the Marquis of Evrémonde were one and the same person.</t6108>
<t6109>"Although my memory remains clear, it is impossible for me to record here the words that were exchanged in our conversation."</t6109> <t6110>"It seems that the lady had knowledge of the intervention I had in an event that she partly knew and partly suspected."</t6110> <t6111>"She did not know that the unfortunate young woman had died."</t6111> <t6112>"Her wishes, as she expressed to me while flooded with tears, were to visit her in secret and show her sympathy, and her desires, to avert the wrath of God suspended over a house that had long been the object of the hatred of so many whom it had plunged into the dark abysses of misfortune."</t6112>
<t6113>"The purpose of that lady's visit, who had reasons to believe that the unfortunate victim of her husband left behind a younger sister, was to implore me to provide her with the name and location of the sister's residence, in order to help and protect her."</t6113> <t6114>"I could only respond that, indeed, such a sister existed; but I could not provide her with information that I did not know at the time, and still do not know as I write these lines..."</t6114>
<t6115>"I'm already out of paper."</t6115> <t6116>"Yesterday they took a sheet from me, I fear that the surveillance I'm under is tighter than ever, and today I must finish my story."</t6116>
<t6117>"The lady was kind, with a compassionate heart, and very unfortunate in her marriage."</t6117> <t6118>"Her husband's brother hated her, distrusted her, and used all his influence against her."</t6118> <t6119>"She feared him, and also feared her husband."</t6119> <t6120>"When I accompanied her to the door of my house, after she said goodbye to me, I saw one of her children, who was waiting for her in the car, a beautiful child of about two to three years old."</t6120>
<t6121>"—For the love of this innocent one, doctor," the poor mother, awash in tears, told me, "I must go, on the path of reparations, as far as my scant strength will allow."</t6121> <t6122>An inner voice tells me that the innocent son must atone for the crimes of his guilty father, if I do not offer some expiation for them in time.</t6122> <t6123>My primary concern must be to instill in his tender heart compassion for his fellow beings, and my final charge, to watch over the sister I seek, if I can find her.</t6123>
<t6124>»He then kissed the child and said to him:</t6124>
<t6125>»—I do everything for you, Carlos.</t6125> <t6126>Will you forget my errands?</t6126>
<t6127>"—Never—responded the boy resolutely.</t6127>
<t6128>"I did not include in my letter a name that had been communicated to me confidentially."</t6128> <t6129>I closed it, and not wanting to entrust it to anyone, that day I took it myself to its destination.</t6129>
<t6130>"At night, it was the last of the year, around nine o'clock, a man dressed in black knocked at my door, said he needed to see me, and my servant Ernesto Defarge led him to my presence."</t6130>
<t6131>"—An urgent case on St. Honoré Street—he said.</t6131>
<t6132>"I left immediately."</t6132> <t6133>"In the street, a car was waiting for me... which brought me here, to the tomb."</t6133> <t6134>"We had barely lost sight of my house when unexpectedly they gagged me and tied my arms with ropes."</t6134> <t6135>"It didn't take long for the two brothers to come out to meet the car."</t6135> <t6136>"The Marquis took the letter I had delivered to the Minister out of his pocket, showed it to me, burned it with the flame of a lantern he was holding, and trampled on the ashes."</t6136> <t6137>"Not a word was spoken."</t6137> <t6138>"They brought me to this tomb, and here I remain."</t6138>
<t6139>»If during the span of these horrible years, God had deigned to touch the heart of either of the two brothers, not to put an end to my dreadful captivity, but to give me news of my beloved wife... to tell me, if nothing else, whether she lives or has died, I would believe that, despite their wickedness, He has not completely abandoned them; but today I believe that the red crosses traced with blood by the dying boy have been fatal for them, I believe that Heaven has condemned them.</t6139> <t6140>As a consequence, I, Alexandre Manette, unfortunate captive, on the last night of the year 1767, denounce the two brothers and all their descendants, to the very last one, to the times that must inevitably come, when men will punish wickedness like that of which they have been guilty.</t6140> <t6141>I also denounce them to heaven and earth.»</t6141>
<t6142>Terrible roars followed the reading of this document.</t6142> <t6143>No words were heard, which the throats could not modulate, but roars that revealed an insatiable thirst for blood.</t6143>
<t6144>Before that tribunal, and before that audience, there was no need to explain how Defarge possessed that terrible document that had just been made public, nor was there any need to make known that the name of that hated family had long been listed in the formidable records of Saint Antoine.</t6144> <t6145>The man capable of defending the mortal upon whom such a grave accusation weighed had not been born.</t6145>
<t6146>The situation of the condemned was infinitely aggravated by the fact that his accuser was a very well-known and highly respectable citizen, his soul friend, none other than his wife's father.</t6146> <t6147>One of the most common aspirations among the populace was to imitate the public virtues of antiquity, to sacrifice oneself for the cause of the people, to immolate the tenderest affections on the altar of the Republic.</t6147> <t6148>This is why, when the President said that the good republican doctor did not hesitate to leave his daughter a widow and his grandson an orphan, in exchange for exterminating a family of pernicious aristocrats, the mobs gave free rein to a wild patriotic fervor, without any heartstrings vibrating with human sympathy.</t6148>
<t6149>"So you have surrounded him with powerful influences, eh, doctor?" murmured Mrs. Defarge, looking and smiling at The Vengeance. "Save him, doctor, save him now, if you can!"</t6149>
<t6150>The jurors expressed themselves through roars.</t6150> <t6151>Each vote cast was a roar, the verdict, a succession of roars.</t6151>
<t6152>The verdict did not take long to arrive.</t6152> <t6153>Carlos Evrémonde, also known as Darnay, aristocrat by heart and blood, enemy of the Republic and fierce oppressor of the people, would return to the Conciergerie to be beheaded within twenty-four hours.</t6153>
<t6154>XI.</t6154>
<t6155>SHADOWS</t6155>
<t6156>The fierce sentence that condemned an innocent man to the ultimate penalty was for the unfortunate wife a sharp dagger that pierced her tender heart.</t6156> <t6157>However, the unhappy woman did not utter a complaint; in the depths of her soul, a powerful voice arose, marking the path of her duty, telling her that her obligation was to support her beloved husband instead of increasing his agonies with her own, and before the incantation of that voice, the young woman stood up proudly, overcoming the effects of the tremendous blow she had received.</t6157>
<t6158>The judges adjourned the session to take part in the boisterous public demonstration that inevitably followed the incident at the hearing, and very soon, with all the doors of the Hall of Justice open, the public exited, indifferent to Lucía's pain, who stretched her yearning arms towards the platform where her husband remained.</t6158>
<t6159>—If I could reach him, my God!</t6159> <t6160>If I could give him a hug, just one! Oh citizens!</t6160> <t6161>Search in your hearts for a remnant of pity and grant a plea that I make to you on my knees!</t6161>
<t6162>There were no more people left there except a jailer with two of the four individuals who had gone to arrest Carlos the day before, and Barsad.</t6162> <t6163>The public was already bustling through the streets.</t6163>
<t6164>—Let him give a hug—proposed Barsad to his companions;—it's a matter of a moment.</t6164>
<t6165>Those beasts softened.</t6165> <t6166>Lucía was able to reach the foot of the platform, and her husband, leaning over the railing, embraced her in his arms.</t6166>
<t6167>—Goodbye, my sweet soul!—he said.</t6167><t6168>—I leave this world blessing the loves I leave behind in it.</t6168> <t6169>In the mansion where hatreds and human passions sleep, we will meet again.</t6169>
<t6170>—My misfortune is dreadful, dear Carlos; but I accept it with resignation.</t6170> <t6171>Do not suffer for me, for God protects me and sustains my strength.</t6171> <t6172>The last blessing for our angel, and farewell!</t6172>
<t6173>—I send it with you, and by kissing you, I kiss both of you, and by saying goodbye to you, I say goodbye to both of you.</t6173>
<t6174>—No...</t6174> <t6175>Dear Carlos, no!</t6175> <t6176>One more moment!—exclaimed Lucía, seeing that the condemned man was trying to free himself from her arms.</t6176><t6177>—Our separation will not be long.</t6177> <t6178>I sense that my sorrows will soon put an end to my sad life; but as long as I have a breath of energy left, I will fulfill my duty, and when I leave our daughter, the merciful God who provided me with good souls that, with their love and selflessness, brightened my existence, will not withhold them from her.</t6178>
<t6179>Her father had followed her, turned into a mute statue of grief, who would have fallen to his knees at their feet, had Carlos not prevented it.</t6179>
<t6180>—No... no!—he shouted, extending his arms—Have you committed any fault, to prostrate yourself on your knees before us?</t6180> <t6181>Ah, no!</t6181> <t6182>Quite the opposite!</t6182> <t6183>Now is when I fully realize the horrible tortures that tore your soul apart!</t6183> <t6184>Now is when I can gauge what you suffered when you suspected the blood that ran through my veins and the despair you must have felt when those suspicions turned into certainty!</t6184> <t6185>Now is when I understand the fierce struggles you had to fight against a natural antipathy, the efforts you necessarily had to make to overcome it!</t6185> <t6186>With all our hearts, we thank you!</t6186> <t6187>All our gratitude is yours, all our affection is yours.</t6187> <t6188>May Heaven bless you, as we bless you!</t6188>
<t6189>The old man could not answer, for his constricted throat was unable to articulate a word, and his body had no energy left except to tear at his hair and let out an occasional moan of anguish.</t6189>
<t6190>—It had to happen this way—replied the convict.</t6190><t6191>—Everything has conspired to reach the fatal outcome we have arrived at.</t6191> <t6192>All the efforts I have made to satisfy that aspiration of my saintly mother, which she expressed the first day you met her and me, have been in vain.</t6192> <t6193>It would have been foolish to expect any good from such an abundant sowing of evils, to delude oneself into thinking that what began with fatal principles could have a happy ending.</t6193> <t6194>Have courage, and forgive me.</t6194> <t6195>May the merciful God shower you with blessings!</t6195>
<t6196>The spouses separated; and while the convict moved away among his guards, his wife remained looking at him, hands together in an attitude of supplication and with a radiant face on which a caressing and comforting smile predominated.</t6196> <t6197>However, no sooner had the condemned disappeared through the door that led to the prison, Lucia bowed her head like a flower cut at the stem, tried to speak, and collapsed to the ground.</t6197>
<t6198>From the dark corner where he had remained hidden since the beginning of the trial, Sydney Carton then emerged and lifted the unfortunate woman from the ground.</t6198> <t6199>Only her father and Lorry remained with her.</t6199> <t6200>Carton's arm trembled as he lifted her, and yet his expression was not solely one of pity; there was a strong mix of pride in it.</t6200>
<t6201>—Shall I take her to the car?—he asked.</t6201><t6202>—I won't feel her weight.</t6202>
<t6203>In his arms, he carried her to the car waiting at the door, where he settled her in.</t6203> <t6204>The elderly doctor and the good Lorry sat beside her, and Carton settled on the box seat, next to the coachman.</t6204>
<t6205>Arriving in front of the gate, at the spot where hours earlier Carton had stopped trying to guess which stones Lucia's feet had tread upon, he took her out of the carriage, and in his arms, he proudly carried her up to her rooms, laying her down on a sofa.</t6205> <t6206>Lucita and Miss Pross were crying inconsolably.</t6206>
<t6207>—Do nothing to dispel her fainting.</t6207><t6208>—said Carton to the last one in a very low voice.</t6208><t6209>—She is better this way.</t6209>
<t6210>—Oh Carton, Carton!—cried Lucie, jumping onto Carton's neck and wrapping her arms around him.</t6210><t6211>—Now that you have come, I don't doubt that you will do something to console mother, to save father.</t6211> <t6212>Look at her, Carton!</t6212> <t6213>Can you, can anyone who loves her look at her without their heart breaking into pieces?</t6213>
<t6214>Carton gave the girl a kiss, gently separated her little arms, gazed at the mother for a few seconds, and said:</t6214>
<t6215>—Before I leave... can I kiss her?</t6215>
<t6216>Later, witnesses of this scene recalled that, while their lips brushed the cheeks of the fainted one, they murmured a few words.</t6216> <t6217>The girl, who was the closest, said later, and repeated many times to her grandchildren when she was an old lady bent under the weight of the years: "It is a life you love."</t6217>
<t6218>In the adjoining room, where he found the doctor and Lorry, he said to the former:</t6218>
<t6219>—Yesterday you had a lot of influence, Doctor Manette; you must use it all.</t6219> <t6220>The judges, and all those who have some power today, are your friends and are grateful for your services; isn't that right?</t6220>
<t6221>—They hid nothing from me regarding Carlos.</t6221> <t6222>I harbored hopes, almost absolute certainty of saving him, and I saved him—replied the doctor, speaking very slowly and with a troubled expression.</t6222>
<t6223>—Try again.</t6223> <t6224>Brief are the hours that separate today from tomorrow; but try.</t6224>
<t6225>—I will try...</t6225> <t6226>I will not rest for a moment.</t6226>
<t6227>—It is what you must do.</t6227> <t6228>I have seen men with your energy accomplish great things, although never—he added, smiling and sighing at the same time—anything as great as what I am proposing to you.</t6228> <t6229>Try, however.</t6229> <t6230>The salvation of a beloved life is well worth that effort.</t6230>
<t6231>—I will present myself to the Attorney General of the Republic and to the President—replied Doctor Manette,—as well as to others who need not be named.</t6231> <t6232>I will also write, and...</t6232> <t6233>But now I remember that public celebrations are being held today and that I will not be able to see anyone until it is night.</t6233>
<t6234>—It's true.</t6234> <t6235>Bah!</t6235> <t6236>In any case, it's a very remote hope; little is lost by waiting until night.</t6236> <t6237>I begin by saying that I expect nothing.</t6237> <t6238>Tell me, Doctor Manette, when do you think you will be able to see those formidable authorities?</t6238>
<t6239>—Immediately after nightfall; I believe within one or two hours.</t6239>
<t6240>—It will get dark shortly after four...</t6240> <t6241>Let's make the most of the hour or two we have ahead of us.</t6241> <t6242>If I show up at Mr. Lorry's house at nine, will I be able to know the result of his efforts?</t6242>
<t6243>—Of course.</t6243>
<t6244>—I hope they have good success!</t6244>
<t6245>He accompanied Lorry to the street door, where he said to him in a very low and sorrowful voice:</t6245>
<t6246>—I expect nothing.</t6246>
<t6247>—Nor I.</t6247>
<t6248>—Even if any one of those men... even if all of those men were willing to grant him life... which is assuming too much, after what happened at the trial, I highly doubt they would dare to do so.</t6248>
<t6249>—I doubt it too...</t6249> <t6250>The blade will not stop.</t6250>
<t6251>Lorry brought her hands to her face and let out some sobs.</t6251>
<t6252>—Do not despair... do not give in to despondency—said Carton with extreme gentleness.</t6252><t6253>—If I have advised the doctor to work tirelessly, it is because his efforts, though they may be fruitless, will one day bring comfort to his daughter.</t6253> <t6254>If her father were to fold his arms, she might think that a life had been sacrificed without anyone making the effort to dispute it with the executioner.</t6254>
<t6255>—Yes, yes, yes!</t6255> <t6256>You are right!—responded Lorry, wiping his eyes.</t6256><t6257>—We will work; but he will die... there isn't an atom of hope left!</t6257>
<t6258>—It's true.</t6258> <t6259>He will die...</t6259> <t6260>There isn't an atom of hope left!—repeated Carton like an echo.</t6260>
<t6261>Then he started walking with a firm step.</t6261>
<t6262>Chapter XII.</t6262>
<t6263>DARKNESS</t6263>
<t6264>Carton had traveled very little distance when he stopped, not yet decided about the place he would head to.</t6264>
<t6265>—At nine o'clock at Tellson's Bank—he murmured.</t6265><t6266>—From now until then, would it be wise for me to be seen?</t6266> <t6267>I think so.</t6267> <t6268>It wouldn't hurt for those people to know that a man like me is around here... it might be a wise precaution... a necessary precaution...</t6268> <t6269>Careful, Carton, careful...! Let's think it over again!</t6269>
<t6270>Suspending the journey already begun in a certain direction, he entered a dark and lonely alley and tried to weigh the pros and cons of his project, measuring with his imagination the scope and probable consequences that it might have.</t6270>
<t6271>—No doubt; it's the best—he thought.</t6271><t6272>—Those people must know that there is a man named Carton in the city.</t6272>
<t6273>With determined steps, he set off towards San Antonio.</t6273>
<t6274>As Defarge had said that same day during the trial that he owned a tavern located in the Saint Antoine district, anyone who knew the city well would have little difficulty finding the tavern in question, without needing to ask anyone.</t6274> <t6275>Carton, therefore, left the dark alley and ate at a dining house, subsequently taking a nap.</t6275> <t6276>In many years, he had not drunk as little as he did that day.</t6276> <t6277>Since the previous night, he had only had a bit of watered-down wine.</t6277>
<t6278>Around seven o'clock he woke up and resumed his march.</t6278> <t6279>Upon reaching the San Antonio neighborhood, he stopped for a moment in front of a shop where he saw a mirror, and slightly adjusted the knot of his tie and disheveled his collar and hair.</t6279> <t6280>Having done this, he headed straight to the Defarge tavern and entered resolutely.</t6280>
<t6281>He found no one in the establishment except Santiago Tercero, whom he remembered seeing that afternoon among the jurors, who was drinking and conversing with the Defarges, husband and wife.</t6281> <t6282>La Venganza, in her capacity as a member of the tavern, was attending the conversation.</t6282>
<t6283>Carton, after taking a seat, ordered a glass of wine.</t6283> <t6284>Madame Defarge gave him an indifferent glance, then a more scrutinizing one, followed by an extraordinarily penetrating look, and finally approached him to ask what he wanted.</t6284>
<t6285>Carton repeated what he had said before.</t6285>
<t6286>—English?—asked the innkeeper, raising her eyebrows.</t6286>
<t6287>Carton, after looking at her for a long while, as if it were very difficult for him to pronounce a French word, replied with a very strong foreign accent:</t6287>
<t6288>—Yes, ma'am, yes; English.</t6288>
<t6289>The barmaid went to the counter to serve the wine, and Carton, while he took a Jacobin newspaper in his hands and pretended to make efforts to interpret the language in which it was written, heard the first one say:</t6289>
<t6290>—I swear he looks like Evrémonde.</t6290>
<t6291>Defarge served the wine, bidding the customer goodnight.</t6291>
<t6292>—What?—asked Carton.</t6292>
<t6293>—Good evening.</t6293>
<t6294>—Oh... very good evening, citizen... and very good wine!</t6294> <t6295>I toast to the Republic!</t6295>
<t6296>Defarge returned to the counter, saying:</t6296>
<t6297>—It's true; he looks a bit like him.</t6297>
<t6298>—And I repeat that he looks a lot like him!—replied the innkeeper harshly.</t6298>
<t6299>—You have it so present in your memory...—observed Santiago Tercero.</t6299>
<t6300>—I swear I don't forget him for a moment either!—exclaimed La Venganza, laughing.</t6300><t6301>—And if I'm not mistaken, you're waiting for tomorrow to see him again.</t6301>
<t6302>Carton continued reading, following the lines of the newspaper with his index finger and giving his full attention to the reading.</t6302> <t6303>The Defarges, La Vengeance, and Jacques Three, heads together and elbows on the counter, were conversing in very low voices.</t6303> <t6304>After a few moments of silence, during which the four people had their eyes fixed on the diligent reader, who had neither eyes nor ears for anything but the newspaper, they resumed their conversation.</t6304>
<t6305>—I think your wife is right.</t6305> <t6306>Why stop until the end of the journey?</t6306> <t6307>The argument is very strong.</t6307>
<t6308>—Whatever you want—objected Defarge—but we will have to stop somewhere.</t6308> <t6309>In reality, the only thing to agree upon is where to make that stop.</t6309>
<t6310>—After the extermination!—replied the innkeeper.</t6310>
<t6311>—Magnificent!—howled Santiago Tercero.</t6311>
<t6312>—Superb!—shouted Revenge.</t6312>
<t6313>—I profess the holy doctrine of extermination, and it goes without saying that, in general, I have nothing against it—observed Defarge.</t6313><t6314>—But we must take into account that this poor doctor has already suffered a lot.</t6314> <t6315>Today you have been able to see it for yourselves, as you all must have noticed the expression on his face while the paper was being read.</t6315>
<t6316>—I have noticed the expression on his face, yes!—replied the innkeeper, putting all the contempt and hatred of her fierce heart into her words.</t6316><t6317>—I have noticed the expression on his face, yes; and I have seen that it was not the face of a true friend of the Republic; that is what I have seen.</t6317>
<t6318>—And the cruel agonies of his daughter, agonies that must have greatly exacerbated his own, would not have escaped your notice—replied Defarge.</t6318>
<t6319>—I have also observed your daughter, yes—replied the innkeeper;—I have observed her many times; not just today.</t6319> <t6320>I observed her today in the Tribunal, and I have observed her on other days in the street, gazing at the prison walls.</t6320> <t6321>It is enough for me to lift a finger, for the blade to immediately drop and make her head roll.</t6321>
<t6322>—You are a prodigious citizen!—roared Santiago Tercero.</t6322>
<t6323>—An angel!—sighed Revenge.</t6323>
<t6324>—As for you—continued the implacable innkeeper, addressing her husband,—I am sure that, if it were up to you... which fortunately it is not... you would still be capable of saving that man.</t6324>
<t6325>—No!—protested Defarge—If by raising this glass I could save him, be sure that I would not raise it!</t6325> <t6326>But I would stop there; I repeat that I would consider my work finished.</t6326>
<t6327>—You can see it now, Santiago—exclaimed the innkeeper, her eyes blazing with rage—</t6327><t6328>You can see it too, my dear Vengeance...</t6328> <t6329>You both see it...</t6329> <t6330>You both hear it...</t6330> <t6331>For a long time, that race has been listed in my records as condemned to destruction, to extermination, for crimes that have nothing to do with tyranny and oppression.</t6331> <t6332>Ask my husband if I'm lying.</t6332>
<t6333>—It's true—replied Defarge, without waiting to be asked.</t6333>
<t6334>—In the early days of the great times, when the Bastille fell, my husband found the document that has been made public today, brought it home, and after midnight, when the establishment was closed and deserted, we read it in this very place and by the light of this very lamp.</t6334> <t6335>Ask him if I speak the truth.</t6335>
<t6336>—It's true, yes—replied Defarge.</t6336>
<t6337>—That very night, after reading the paper and extinguishing the lamp, when the day began to filter through the cracks in the windows and the bars of the grilles, I told him that I had a secret to share with him.</t6337> <t6338>Let him tell you if I lie.</t6338>
<t6339>—It's true—agreed Defarge.</t6339>
<t6340>—And I told him the secret.</t6340> <t6341>I struck his chest with these two hands, as I strike it now, and I said: "Defarge; I was raised among fishermen on the beach, and the peasant family so outraged by the Evrémonde brothers, that family described in the paper found in the Bastille, is my family.</t6341> <t6342>Defarge, the dying sister of the mortally wounded peasant boy was my sister, the husband was my sister's husband, the fruit of their love that never opened its eyes to the light was my sister's child, and that peasant brother was my brother, and the father who died of grief was my father, those who died were my dead, and their cries for vengeance have been directed at me ever since..." Ask him if what I say is true.</t6342>
<t6343>—That's right—confessed Defarge.</t6343>
<t6344>—And now, tell me if it is possible to put gates on the gale or extinguish the fire of hell!—replied the innkeeper.</t6344><t6345>—But no; it is not necessary for you to tell me.</t6345>
<t6346>The two listeners savored a horrible pleasure in convincing themselves of the implacable nature of the innkeeper's hatred, whose ghostly pallor the newspaper reader was seeing without seeing her face.</t6346> <t6347>Defarge, a minor insignificant, ventured a few words highlighting the compassion of the Marquis's wife; but he achieved nothing more than the repetition of his wife's last words:</t6347>
<t6348>—Tell me if it is possible to put gates on the gale or extinguish the fire of hell!</t6348>
<t6349>The entrance of some patrons put an end to the conference.</t6349> <t6350>The Englishman paid the incurred expense and asked where the National Palace was.</t6350> <t6351>Mrs. Defarge accompanied him to the door, and there, placing her arm over his, indicated the way he should follow.</t6351> <t6352>The English patron felt the urge to lift that arm and strike its owner with a sure hand.</t6352>
<t6353>Carton moved away from those places, soon circling the prison walls.</t6353> <t6354>At the appointed hour, he presented himself at Lorry's house, where he found the old man waiting for him, anxious and full of worry.</t6354> <t6355>The good banker informed him that he had been accompanying Lucía until moments before, and that he had parted from her to attend the agreed meeting; that they had not seen her father since he left at four in the afternoon; that Lucía harbored some hope that, through the doctor's intervention, Carlos might be saved, but that the hopes were very weak.</t6355>
<t6356>The doctor's absence lasted five hours: where could he be?</t6356> <t6357>Lorry waited for him until ten, and since he could not resign himself to leaving Lucía alone and without news for so long, they decided that Lorry would return to the house of the unfortunate woman, and that Carton would wait for the doctor's arrival.</t6357> <t6358>Lorry was to return to the Bank at midnight.</t6358>
<t6359>Twelve o'clock struck and the doctor did not appear.</t6359> <t6360>Lorry returned, and neither found any news nor brought any.</t6360> <t6361>Where could he be?</t6361>
<t6362>This was the point they were discussing, almost opening their hearts to hope, founded on the prolonged absence, when they heard his footsteps on the stairs.</t6362> <t6363>As soon as he appeared in the room, they saw that all was lost.</t6363>
<t6364>It has never been known whether he spent all the long hours of absence wandering aimlessly through the streets, or if he visited his acquaintances.</t6364> <t6365>He entered the room, remained with his gaze fixed on those who were waiting for him, and did not utter a word, nor did anyone speak to him, for the expression on his face clearly said that all was lost.</t6365>
<t6366>—I can't find it—he said.</t6366><t6367>—Where is it? I need it.</t6367>
<t6368>He came with his head bare and the front of his shirt open.</t6368> <t6369>After casting anguished glances around, he took off his coat and sat on the ground.</t6369>
<t6370>—But where is my stool?</t6370> <t6371>I've been looking for it everywhere without being able to find it.</t6371> <t6372>What have they done with my work?</t6372> <t6373>I need to finish those shoes... they are urgently awaited.</t6373>
<t6374>The two listeners looked at each other, dismayed.</t6374>
<t6375>—Well... well!—replied the old man.</t6375><t6376>—My stool... my work started...!</t6376> <t6377>I repeat, it is very urgent!...</t6377>
<t6378>Not receiving a response, he pulled his hair and stomped on the ground, similar to an angry child.</t6378>
<t6379>—Don't torment a wretched man!—he exclaimed, letting out a formidable cry.</t6379><t6380>—Give me my work... for God's sake!</t6380> <t6381>What will become of us if I don't finish the shoes tonight?</t6381>
<t6382>Lost, completely lost!</t6382>
<t6383>It was useless to try to light a lamp that the fierce hurricane of misfortune had extinguished forever.</t6383> <t6384>To Lorry's horror, to Sydney Carton's terror, Dr. Manette was once again the shoemaker of the garret, the unfortunate idiot who years before had been handed over to the innkeeper Defarge.</t6384>
<t6385>Both impressed, affected by the same idea and understanding the need to overcome their emotions, they devoted themselves not to trying to revive that completely extinguished intelligence, but to calming the unhappy old man, promising him that very soon the bench, the tools, and the shoes would be returned to him.</t6385>
<t6386>—He has succumbed to the blow, excessively harsh for him—said Carton.</t6386><t6387>—Yes; there is no choice but to take him to his daughter; but before doing so, would you be so kind as to give me a moment of your attention?</t6387> <t6388>I need to impose some conditions and extract a promise from you; but do not ask me the reason for the former nor the why of the latter, for I have a reason to keep them silent... and it is of great importance.</t6388>
<t6389>—I don't doubt it—replied Lorry.</t6389><t6390>—Go on.</t6390>
<t6391>In a chair placed between the two interlocutors sat the old man, rocking monotonously and sobbing.</t6391> <t6392>The interlocutors spoke in very low voices, as if they were beside the bed of a sick person.</t6392>
<t6393>Carton got down to pick up the doctor's frock coat from the ground.</t6393> <t6394>As he did so, a small box fell to the ground where the doctor used to keep the list of visits he had to make during the day.</t6394> <t6395>He picked it up and opened it, finding a folded paper inside.</t6395>
<t6396>—Do you want us to see what this is?—he asked.</t6396>
<t6397>Lorry nodded with a movement of his head.</t6397>
<t6398>—Thank you, my God!—exclaimed Carton as soon as he unfolded the paper.</t6398>
<t6399>—What is it?—asked Lorry with a longing tone.</t6399>
<t6400>—A little patience; I will explain it to you in due time.</t6400> <t6401>First of all—he said, reaching into the inner pocket of his frock coat and taking out another paper,—you should see this, which is a certificate, thanks to which I can leave the city without inconvenience.</t6401> <t6402>Read it....</t6402> <t6403>Sydney Carton, English subject...</t6403>
<t6404>Lorry was left contemplating the paper.</t6404>
<t6405>—Keep it until tomorrow.</t6405> <t6406>You will remember that I have to visit the prisoner, and I don't think it's wise to take it with me to the jail.</t6406>
<t6407>—Why not?</t6407>
<t6408>—I don't know...</t6408> <t6409>A whim, perhaps, but I prefer not to wear it.</t6409> <t6410>Also take the paper that Doctor Manette carried in his pocket, which is another similar certificate, a safe-conduct allowing him, his daughter, and his granddaughter to pass through the Barrier and the border at any time.</t6410> <t6411>Do you see it?</t6411>
<t6412>—Yes.</t6412>
<t6413>—Probably he provided it yesterday, in order to take all kinds of precautions against the storm.</t6413> <t6414>What date does it have?</t6414> <t6415>But it doesn't matter; there's no need to take note of that detail.</t6415> <t6416>The essential thing is that you keep it together with mine and yours.</t6416> <t6417>Now then; listen carefully to my words, and do not forget them; until two hours ago, it didn't cross my mind that you might need that paper, which today is firm and valid, and will be so as long as it is not revoked.</t6417> <t6418>But they can revoke it; and moreover: powerful reasons make me believe that they will revoke it very soon.</t6418>
<t6419>—Are they in danger?</t6419>
<t6420>—They are in imminent danger.</t6420> <t6421>They are in danger of being denounced by the innkeeper Defarge; no one told me this; I heard it from her own lips.</t6421> <t6422>Tonight I overheard a conversation of that woman, and the conversation made me see the danger that threatens the doctor's family.</t6422> <t6423>Since I heard it, I have not wasted any time, I visited my spy, and my initial impressions have been fully confirmed.</t6423> <t6424>He knows that a wood sawyer, a creation of the Defarges, is ready to declare that he saw her (Carton never pronounced Lucie's name) signaling to the prisoners.</t6424> <t6425>It is not difficult to guess that there are plenty of reasons to base any accusation on the mentioned fact, a plot against the Republic, for example, whose consequence would be her death, who knows if also that of her daughter... perhaps even that of her father, for both have also been seen in the same place...</t6425> <t6426>Do not be afraid... you will save them all.</t6426>
<t6427>—May Heaven will it, Carton! But how?</t6427>
<t6428>—That is what I am going to tell you right now.</t6428> <t6429>I trust you, convinced that I could not put the matter in better hands.</t6429> <t6430>The new denunciation will not be made until the day after tomorrow... they will probably leave it for two or three days later, and it is even more likely that they will delay it for a week.</t6430> <t6431>You know perfectly well that in this blessed country, anyone who cries or sympathizes with a victim of the guillotine incurs the death penalty.</t6431> <t6432>There is no doubt that both she and her father will be guilty of the aforementioned crime, and I can assure you that the innkeeper, whose fierce hatred reaches inconceivable extremes, will wait until she has weapons that increase the strength of her denunciation and make the result doubly certain.</t6432> <t6433>Do you understand?</t6433>
<t6434>—With such attention, and so deeply convinced of the accuracy of what you assert, that I even momentarily forget this misfortune—he replied, extending his right hand towards the doctor's chair.</t6434>
<t6435>—You should not encounter difficulties, as you have plenty of money, to reach the coast using the fastest means of transportation.</t6435> <t6436>You have already completed your preparations to return to England several days ago.</t6436> <t6437>Give orders for the horses to be harnessed tomorrow to start the journey at two in the afternoon.</t6437>
<t6438>—They will be.</t6438>
<t6439>—Didn't I say before that it was impossible to put the matter in better hands?</t6439> <t6440>You have a heart full of nobility.</t6440> <t6441>Tonight, tell her that you know the danger looming over her head, and that this danger may also involve her daughter and her father.</t6441> <t6442>Insist on this point, because if you don't, it's likely that you won't achieve anything, as she, without hesitation, and even full of joy, would place her beautiful head next to her husband's, so that the same blow would make both of their heads roll.</t6442> <t6443>By insisting on the danger her daughter faces and the threat to her father, make her see the imperative need to leave Paris tomorrow at the indicated time, with them and with you.</t6443> <t6444>Tell her that it is her husband's wish, an express wish on whose fulfillment much more depends than she can suppose or expect.</t6444> <t6445>Don't you think that her father, despite the lamentable condition of his mind, will submit to his daughter's wishes?</t6445>
<t6446>—I am sure of it.</t6446>
<t6447>—I supposed so.</t6447> <t6448>Above all, have everything ready for the indicated time.</t6448> <t6449>The car prepared, the horses hitched, and you all seated in your places.</t6449> <t6450>The moment I arrive, place me in the car, and off we go.</t6450>
<t6451>—Should I await your arrival, no matter what happens?</t6451>
<t6452>—You have my safe-conduct in your possession, along with the others, a safe-conduct that entitles me to a seat.</t6452> <t6453>You will wait until that seat is occupied, and as soon as it is, to England as quickly as possible.</t6453>
<t6454>—In that case—remarked Lorry, giving Carton a firm handshake,—everything no longer depends on a poor old man, since I will have by my side a passionate and determined young man.</t6454>
<t6455>—With God's help, you will have it!</t6455> <t6456>Promise me now solemnly that for nothing in the world will you alter or modify anything we have agreed upon.</t6456>
<t6457>—Nothing, Carton; I swear.</t6457>
<t6458>—Tomorrow, try to frequently remember these words: "A variation... a delay... whatever the cause it obeys, it can jeopardize the salvation of everyone's lives and inevitably lead to the sacrifice of many others."</t6458>
<t6459>—I will remember them.</t6459> <t6460>I hope that God will give me the strength to faithfully fulfill my mission.</t6460>
<t6461>—I also hope that I will not lack anything to fulfill mine.</t6461> <t6462>And now... goodbye.</t6462>
<t6463>He did not leave, however, although after pronouncing the farewell word, he brought to his lips and kissed the hand that Lorry extended to him.</t6463> <t6464>First, he helped the doctor up from the chair, put on his coat and hat, and encouraged him to leave, telling him they were going to fetch the stool and shoes he desired.</t6464> <t6465>He accompanied the two elderly men to the garden of the house where a wounded heart wept, so happy in other times, and when they left him alone, he remained for a few moments contemplating a window, whose shutters let out some threads of light, the window of her room.</t6465> <t6466>Before leaving, his heart sent a solemn farewell to the window wrapped in a beautiful cloud of blessings.</t6466>
<t6467>Chapter XIII.</t6467>
<t6468>FIFTY-TWO</t6468>
<t6469>Enclosed within blackened walls, the condemned of the day awaited the hour to ascend the scaffold in the sinister prison of the Concierge.</t6469> <t6470>They were as many as the weeks in a year.</t6470> <t6471>Fifty-two human lives were to be lost that afternoon in the insatiable sea that absorbs them all.</t6471> <t6472>Before their cells were emptied, those who would replace them had already been designated; before their blood flowed over the blood spilled the previous day, the blood that would mix with theirs the following day had already been set aside in a separate place.</t6472>
<t6473>Fifty-two lives cut short, fifty-two victims, belonging to all social classes; from the wealthy seventy-year-old landowner, whose riches were of no use in prolonging his life, to the wretched laborer, whose obscurity and misery could not save him either.</t6473> <t6474>In the same way that physical diseases, which originate from the vices and neglects of men, claim their victims without regard to categories or ages, so too do the dreadful moral ailments, engendered by unspeakable sufferings, intolerable oppressions, and cruel indifferences, strike equally and without distinction of persons.</t6474>
<t6475>Carlos Darnay, locked in his cell alone with his thoughts, harbored no illusions since he left the Hall of Justice.</t6475> <t6476>In every word of the terrible narrative read there, he saw a death sentence, and it was clear to him that no human influence could save him, that virtually a sentence pronounced by millions of votes weighed upon him, against which individual efforts were of no use.</t6476>
<t6477>It was not, however, an easy task to resign oneself to dying, for someone like him who still kept the image of his beloved wife fresh in his mind.</t6477> <t6478>Very strong ties bound him to life, and it was hard, very hard, to see so closely the blade that would cut them forever.</t6478> <t6479>His thoughts tumbled over each other, agitated tumultuously in his chest, fought fierce battles among themselves, and in the end, they joined forces to contend against resignation.</t6479> <t6480>If he momentarily managed to calm them, the image of his wife immediately surfaced, the image of his tender daughter, he remembered that he was leaving them in the world, and he protested against it with all the strength of his soul, no less than if the sharpest selfishness were encouraging him in his chest.</t6480>
<t6481>It is true that these struggles did not last long.</t6481> <t6482>It wasn't long before the consideration that the death awaiting him did not carry the appendage of dishonor acted as a powerful stimulant, and the thought that many, as innocent as he, walked the same painful path he had to walk every day and with firm steps.</t6482> <t6483>He then thought of the future peace of mind that, after the initial moments, his loved ones left in the world would enjoy if they saw him accept death with manly fortitude, and in this way, little by little and by degrees, he began to regain his calm and immerse himself in reflections of a higher nature.</t6483>
<t6484>Before the night closed in, he had advanced most of the way on the journey of his resignation.</t6484> <t6485>Equipped with writing materials and a light, he took up the pen and did not put it down until the hour came when the prison regulations required the lamps to be extinguished.</t6485>
<t6486>He wrote a very lengthy letter to Lucía, demonstrating to her that he had never had any news of her father's eternal captivity until he heard it from the man's own lips, and that, prior to reading the document found in the Bastille, he was as ignorant as she was of the direct culpability of her father and uncle in that sad event.</t6486> <t6487>He had already explained to her that, if he had concealed his true surname, a surname he had renounced, it was to fulfill a condition, whose reason he now perfectly understood, imposed by the doctor when giving his consent to the romantic relationship with his daughter, and ratified on the morning of their wedding.</t6487> <t6488>He earnestly begged her that, for the love of her father, she should never attempt to find out whether he had forgotten the existence of the document, or whether the story of the Tower of London told under the plane tree in the garden that summer night had reminded him of it.</t6488> <t6489>If he retained any memory of the document in question, he undoubtedly assumed it had been destroyed with the Bastille, seeing that it was not among the relics of the prisoners found by the mob and made so public that the entire world knew of them.</t6489> <t6490>He urged her—though adding that he already knew the recommendation was futile—to console her father, convincing him, by all imaginable means, that not only had he done nothing reprehensible, nothing that would have caused his misfortune, but that, on the contrary, he had always sacrificed himself for the happiness of his daughter and his daughter's husband.</t6490> <t6491>He ended by recommending that she try to overcome her sorrow, devote herself to her beloved daughter, and above all, that through sheer tenderness she console her father.</t6491>
<t6492>He wrote another letter to the doctor inspired by the same thoughts, telling him that he entrusted his wife and daughter to his care.</t6492> <t6493>With vibrant phrasing, he made this request, not because he considered it necessary, but rather to lift his spirits and drive away retrospective thoughts, which he assumed would arise more strongly than ever.</t6493>
<t6494>He addressed a letter to Mr. Lorry, entrusting to his care the loved ones he was leaving behind and explaining all his earthly matters.</t6494> <t6495>He did not remember Carton.</t6495> <t6496>There were so many thoughts overwhelming him that they left no room for a person with whom he never had frequent interactions.</t6496>
<t6497>When the lights went out and he lay down on the miserable straw mattress, he thought he had already finished with the world.</t6497>
<t6498>However, he resurfaced during his sleep, and he resurfaced brilliant, charming.</t6498> <t6499>He found himself again in the quiet little corner of Soho, free, happy, content, in the company of his Lucia, who assured him that it had all been a dream, a nightmare, that they had never left England, that he had never been separated from her.</t6499> <t6500>This dream was followed by a pause of complete forgetfulness, after which he imagined that he lived with his wife, but dead, decapitated.</t6500> <t6501>Another pause of forgetfulness ensued, and he finally woke up in the morning, without realizing where he was or remembering what had happened the day before, until these words sprang into his mind in fiery characters: "Today is the day of your death."</t6501>
<t6502>It was the day when fifty-two heads were to roll, one of them his own, and while resigned to his sad fate, he gathered his courage to endure it with calm heroism, his thoughts, very difficult to control, feverishly embarked on new paths.</t6502>
<t6503>He had never seen the terrible instrument that hours later would cut his life short.</t6503> <t6504>How high above the ground the gloomy machine would be, how many steps the fatal staircase had, where it would be placed, whose hands would be responsible for placing him on the block, whether they would be stained with blood, which way he would turn his head, whether he would be the first or the last; these and other similar questions he asked himself over and over, hurriedly, not by his will, but by his overexcited imagination.</t6504> <t6505>Neither were they inspired by fear, but rather by a strange desire to know what he would do when the time came, a desire that was disproportionate to the fleeting moments to which it referred, an inexplicable curiosity felt by a soul different from his own.</t6505>
<t6506>Time passed and the clock struck hours that the unfortunate man would never hear again.</t6506> <t6507>Nine, ten, eleven o'clock struck, and it was about to strike twelve.</t6507> <t6508>The condemned man walked more calmly each time.</t6508> <t6509>The worst of the internal struggle had passed.</t6509> <t6510>His imagination was no longer disturbed by absurd thoughts, he could now pray for himself and his loved ones.</t6510>
<t6511>The clock struck twelve.</t6511>
<t6512>They had told him that the final hour that would strike for him in the world would be three o'clock, and he knew that they would take him out of the dungeon well before the indicated hour, as the death carts traveled very slowly on the way to the gallows.</t6512> <t6513>He supposed, therefore, that they would call him at two.</t6513>
<t6514>With his arms crossed in front of his chest, he was pacing his cell when the clock struck one; he did not lose his heroic calm.</t6514> <t6515>Fervently, he gave thanks to God for having given him the strength to regain his composure, and he thought:</t6515>
<t6516>"I have another hour left."</t6516>
<t6517>The sound of footsteps echoed in the outer passage.</t6517> <t6518>The door of his cell opened and closed again without a sound.</t6518> <t6519>Someone said these words by the door, already open, or while they were opening it:</t6519>
<t6520>"He has never seen me here, as I have always taken care to stay out of his way.</t6520> <t6521>Go in... I will wait outside... Don't waste time."</t6521>
<t6522>In front of the prisoner appeared a man who looked at him smiling, calm.</t6522> <t6523>It was Sydney Carton.</t6523>
<t6524>Such was the expression on his face, so remarkable his gaze, that in the first instant the prisoner feared it was an unreal apparition, a product of his agitated imagination.</t6524> <t6525>But the apparition spoke, and the tone of his voice was that of Carton; he clasped the prisoner's hand, and his hand was a real hand, of flesh and bone.</t6525>
<t6526>—I bet I am the last human being you would expect to see: am I wrong?</t6526>
<t6527>—Not only did I not expect to see you, but even seeing you, I am doubting that the Sydney Carton I have known is standing before me... Are you also a prisoner?</t6527>
<t6528>—No.</t6528> <t6529>Chance has made me the master of one of the jailers of this prison, and to that circumstance, I owe the fact that I am beside you.</t6529> <t6530>I come on her behalf... on behalf of your wife, my dear Darnay.</t6530>
<t6531>The prisoner silently extended his hand.</t6531>
<t6532>—And I bring the task of making a plea to you.</t6532>
<t6533>—What is it?</t6533>
<t6534>—It is the most fervent plea, the most urgent, the most ardent of those that have been addressed to him by that voice which is so dear to him.</t6534> <t6535>Do not ignore it, because that dear voice addresses him with the most pathetic tone that has ever sounded in his ears.</t6535>
<t6536>The prisoner bowed his head without answering.</t6536>
<t6537>—You don't have the time to ask me why I am the emissary tasked with making the plea in question, or to ask me for explanations about what it means, nor do I have the time to give them to you.</t6537> <t6538>Your duty... a sacred duty, is to obey without question...</t6538> <t6539>Take off your boots, and put on mine!</t6539>
<t6540>Attached to one of the walls, behind the convict, there was a chair.</t6540> <t6541>Carton, while speaking with lightning speed, had forced him to sit in the chair in question.</t6541>
<t6542>—Take off your shoes and put on these boots of mine... Quickly!...</t6542>
<t6543>—Carton...</t6543> <t6544>It is impossible to escape from here—replied Carlos, completely bewildered;—utterly impossible...</t6544> <t6545>You will achieve nothing but dying with me...</t6545> <t6546>It is madness....</t6546>
<t6547>—It would be madness if I told you to escape; but have I even hinted at it?</t6547> <t6548>When I tell you to go through that door, answer me that it's madness and don't pay attention to me...</t6548> <t6549>Take off that tie and put on mine...</t6549> <t6550>That's it...</t6550> <t6551>Now the coat...</t6551> <t6552>We will exchange coats... Magnificent!</t6552> <t6553>Allow me to remove that ribbon that holds your hair, and to mess up your hairstyle a bit... that's it!</t6553> <t6554>Now you are as poorly groomed as I am.</t6554>
<t6555>With astonishing speed, with a willpower that seemed more supernatural than human, he transformed the prisoner in the blink of an eye.</t6555> <t6556>The convict seemed like a child without will in his hands.</t6556>
<t6557>—Carton... My dear Carton!</t6557> <t6558>It's madness... a folly!</t6558> <t6559>It's not possible to carry it out...</t6559> <t6560>It has never been achieved...</t6560> <t6561>Dozens of times they have tried and it has always resulted in the most resounding failure...</t6561> <t6562>For God's sake, my dear friend, I beg you not to increase my sorrows by sacrificing your life in vain...!</t6562> <t6563>Isn't it enough that I die?</t6563>
<t6564>—Have I by any chance told you, my dear Darnay, to go beyond that door?</t6564> <t6565>When I tell you, answer firmly that no, and the matter will be settled.</t6565> <t6566>I see paper, ink, and a pen on that table; do you have a steady hand?</t6566> <t6567>Can you write?</t6567>
<t6568>—I had it firm when you came in.</t6568>
<t6569>—Well, it is necessary for him to be so again, so that he writes very clearly what I am going to dictate... Quickly, my friend, quickly!</t6569>
<t6570>Darnay, astonished, amazed, stunned, took a seat in front of the table.</t6570> <t6571>Carton, with his right hand placed on his chest, stood beside him.</t6571>
<t6572>—Write down point by point what I dictate to you.</t6572>
<t6573>—To whom should I address the document?</t6573>
<t6574>—Nobody.</t6574>
<t6575>Carton's right hand remained fixed over his chest.</t6575>
<t6576>—Shall I set a date?</t6576>
<t6577>—No.</t6577>
<t6578>The prisoner raised his head every time he asked a question; Carton, without moving his right hand, looked at the ground.</t6578>
<t6579>"If you have not forgotten the words that passed between us," said Carton dictating, "you will easily understand this letter as soon as you read it."</t6579> <t6580>"I know positively that you remember them, for you are not one to forget quickly."</t6580>
<t6581>The prisoner, who did not understand the meaning of what he was writing, unexpectedly raised his eyes and caught Carton in the act of taking his hand out of his chest.</t6581> <t6582>It stopped.</t6582>
<t6583>—Have you written "they forget quickly?"</t6583>
<t6584>—Yes.</t6584> <t6585>Do you have any weapon in your hand?</t6585>
<t6586>—No; I don't have any weapons.</t6586>
<t6587>—What does he/she have, then?</t6587>
<t6588>—In a moment you will know...</t6588> <t6589>Continue writing, as there are very few words left...</t6589> <t6590>«I thank God who allows me to prove them with deeds.</t6590> <t6591>I would not want what I do to be a cause of sorrow or sadness for anyone.»</t6591>
<t6592>While he dictated these words, his eyes fixed on the one who was writing, his right hand moved cautiously closer to the face of the prisoner.</t6592>
<t6593>The pen fell from Darnay's hand, who looked around with a dazed expression.</t6593>
<t6594>—What steamer is this?—he asked.</t6594>
<t6595>—Steam?</t6595>
<t6596>—Yes... a smell that bothers and stuns me.</t6596>
<t6597>—I perceive nothing...</t6597> <t6598>It is not possible that vapors are being inhaled here...</t6598> <t6599>Take up the pen again and let us finish... Quickly, quickly!</t6599>
<t6600>The prisoner, whose breathing had become labored, and whose face reflected the disorder of his faculties, leaned over the paper ready to write.</t6600>
<t6601>"Had the course of events been different—continued dictating Carton, whose right hand was under the scribe's nose,—it is natural that I would have missed this opportunity; had the course of events been different..."</t6601>
<t6602>Carton fixed his eyes on the pen and saw that it was scribbling unintelligible signs.</t6602>
<t6603>The prisoner straightened up suddenly, directing a look full of reproaches at Carton; but the latter's right hand moved closer and closer to his nose, while his left arm encircled his waist.</t6603> <t6604>The prisoner struggled weakly and for a few seconds with the man who had come to give his life for his; but before a minute had passed, he lay motionless on the ground.</t6604>
<t6605>Carton immediately put on the clothes that the prisoner had left minutes before, combed his hair better than ever, tied his hair with the ribbon that had previously held Darnay's, and said in a very low voice:</t6605>
<t6606>—Come in... come in!...</t6606>
<t6607>Two seconds later, the spy appeared.</t6607>
<t6608>—Do you see it?—asked Carton, raising his head, and then kneeling down to place the paper he had written into Charles's pocket.</t6608><t6609>—Didn't I tell you that your risk was insignificant?</t6609>
<t6610>—My risk, Mr. Carton, is not in this—replied the spy,—but in you faithfully fulfilling what was stipulated.</t6610>
<t6611>—Rest assured, I will adhere to the agreement until death.</t6611>
<t6612>—That is how it must be for the number fifty-two to be exact.</t6612> <t6613>As long as you complete it, dressed as you are right now, I fear nothing.</t6613>
<t6614>—You have nothing to fear.</t6614> <t6615>I, who could harm you, will soon disappear from this world, thank God...</t6615> <t6616>Now, help me; or rather; take me to the car.</t6616>
<t6617>—To you?—asked the spy with visible apprehension.</t6617>
<t6618>—To him, man of God, to the prisoner with whom I exchange fate!</t6618> <t6619>Will he leave through the same door through which I entered?</t6619>
<t6620>—Of course.</t6620>
<t6621>—Well then; since I was weak and faint when I entered, it is only natural that I leave even weaker and fainter.</t6621> <t6622>The eternal farewell has affected me so much that I lost consciousness; this has happened here very often... too often.</t6622> <t6623>It is your responsibility not to make any blunders... Quickly... Call for help.</t6623>
<t6624>—Do you swear that you will not betray me?—asked the spy, trembling.</t6624>
<t6625>—But man!</t6625> <t6626>Haven't I already solemnly sworn it?—replied Carton, stomping impatiently.</t6626><t6627>—Why, then, waste now moments that are precious?</t6627> <t6628>Take him to the courtyard you know, place him in the carriage, take him to Mr. Lorry's side, tell him not to give him any medicine, that all he needs is air, to remember my words from last night, to keep the promise he made to me last night, and nothing more.</t6628>
<t6629>The spy withdrew, and Carton sat at the table, resting his elbows on it.</t6629> <t6630>Seconds later, the spy re-entered with two men.</t6630>
<t6631>—Man!—exclaimed one of them, upon seeing Carlos lying on the ground.</t6631><t6632>—Has it shocked him so much to see that his friend won the jackpot in the Santa Guillotina lottery?</t6632>
<t6633>—Indeed, a good patriot would not have been more distressed if the aristocrat had been declared acquitted!—observed the other.</t6633>
<t6634>Between the two of them, they placed the unconscious person on a stretcher they had brought and took him away.</t6634>
<t6635>—Few hours of life remain for you, Evrémonde!—said the spy.</t6635>
<t6636>—I know it very well—responded Carton.</t6636><t6637>—Take care of my friend and leave me alone.</t6637>
<t6638>—Let's go, my children—said the spy to his companions.</t6638><t6639>—Let's move.</t6639>
<t6640>The door closed, leaving Carton alone.</t6640> <t6641>He concentrated all the faculties of his soul in his hearing in case something sounded that indicated suspicions or alarms; nothing was heard.</t6641> <t6642>Keys turned in the locks, doors closed with a crash, footsteps receded, but no scream was heard nor was the usual order or tranquility disturbed.</t6642> <t6643>Carton, now calmer, remained seated in front of the table until two o'clock struck.</t6643>
<t6644>Then, sounds reached his ears that neither alarmed nor surprised him, simply because he knew perfectly well what they meant.</t6644> <t6645>Many doors were successively opened, until finally it was the turn of his cell.</t6645> <t6646>A jailer, equipped with a list, without stepping over the threshold, merely said:</t6646>
<t6647>—Follow me, Evrémonde.</t6647>
<t6648>Carton followed the jailer until they reached a dark, large cell, located quite a distance away, crowded with prisoners.</t6648> <t6649>Although the light was very dim, Carton could see that everyone had their arms tied, some were standing and others sitting, some were complaining while others were pacing restlessly and nervously.</t6649> <t6650>Most of them, however, remained silent and motionless, with their eyes fixed on the ground.</t6650>
<t6651>While standing next to the blackish wall, he gazed at his fifty-one gallows companions, some of whom had entered after him, when a man stopped to embrace him.</t6651> <t6652>Carton shuddered, fearing he had been discovered, but the man continued on his way after giving him a hug.</t6652> <t6653>Moments later, a graceful little girl with lovely features rose from the ground and approached Carton.</t6653>
<t6654>—Citizen Evrémonde—she said, extending her cold hand;—I am a little seamstress who was your fellow prisoner in La Force.</t6654>
<t6655>—Ah, yes!—murmured Carton.</t6655><t6656>—It's true!</t6656> <t6657>What I don't remember is the accusation that brought you to jail.</t6657>
<t6658>—They accused me of being a conspirator; but the good Lord knows that I am innocent.</t6658> <t6659>Can there be a conspirator who entrusts their machinations to a weak girl like me?</t6659>
<t6660>The smile with which the young girl accompanied her words moved Carton so deeply that tears came to his eyes.</t6660>
<t6661>—I am not afraid to die, citizen Evrémonde, but I repeat that I have done nothing.</t6661> <t6662>I would even die with joy if the Republic, which they say is to make the poor happy, could gain some benefit from my death; but if I am to say what I feel, I do not believe that my death will serve any purpose, Evrémonde.</t6662> <t6663>What benefits could the Republic gain from the death of a weak creature like me?</t6663>
<t6664>The compassion that the girl inspired in Carton was infinite.</t6664>
<t6665>—I heard that you had been acquitted, Citizen Evrémonde, and I truly regret that it is not true.</t6665>
<t6666>—I was; but then they caught me again and have condemned me.</t6666>
<t6667>—If they place us in the same cart, Citizen Evrémonde, will you allow me to hold your hand?</t6667> <t6668>It's not that I'm afraid; but since I am a child, your hand will give me the courage I lack.</t6668>
<t6669>Carton saw that through the girl's eyes, as she fixed them on his face, first a cloud of doubt passed, and then one of astonishment.</t6669>
<t6670>—Are you going to die for him?</t6670>
<t6671>—And for his wife and daughter... yes!</t6671>
<t6672>—Oh! Will you allow me to hold your valiant hand in mine?</t6672>
<t6673>—Yes, my unfortunate sister... until the very last moment.</t6673>
<t6674>The same shadows that envelop the condemned surround the crowds stationed at the same hour in the vicinity of the Barrier at the moment when a road coach, coming from the interior of the city, approaches to present the documents of its occupants.</t6674>
<t6675>—Who are the travelers?</t6675> <t6676>Let's see... the documents!</t6676>
<t6677>A hand presents the documents, which are read.</t6677>
<t6678>—Alejandro Manette... doctor... French...</t6678> <t6679>Let's see; who is it?</t6679>
<t6680>An extended arm indicates an exhausted old man who murmurs unintelligible words.</t6680>
<t6681>—It seems that the citizen doctor has his faculties disturbed, doesn't he?</t6681> <t6682>The fever of the Revolution has burned his brain.</t6682>
<t6683>—It seems so.</t6683>
<t6684>—Bah!</t6684> <t6685>There are many who find themselves in his situation...</t6685> <t6686>Lucía, his daughter... French...</t6686> <t6687>Who is she?</t6687>
<t6688>—This one.</t6688>
<t6689>—Very well.</t6689> <t6690>Evrémonde embarks on another different journey... Lucie, daughter of Lucie... English... Is this her?</t6690>
<t6691>—The same one.</t6691>
<t6692>—Give me a kiss, daughter of Evrémonde...</t6692> <t6693>You have kissed a good republican, a new thing in your family, don't forget it.</t6693> <t6694>Sydney Carton, lawyer, English... Who is he?</t6694>
<t6695>This one lying at the bottom of the car.</t6695>
<t6696>—Is the English lawyer unconscious?</t6696>
<t6697>—Yes... his health is very broken, but the fresh air will undoubtedly do him good.</t6697> <t6698>He has just said goodbye to a friend of his who has had the misfortune of falling into the disfavor of the Republic.</t6698>
<t6699>—Does he faint over such a small thing?</t6699> <t6700>Many are those who incur the displeasure of the Republic, and the misfortune of many...</t6700> <t6701>Mauricio Lorry, banker, English... Who is the banker?</t6701>
<t6702>—It's me; it can't be anyone else, since no one else is left in the car.</t6702>
<t6703>Mauricio Lorry was the one who had answered the previous questions, Mauricio Lorry the one who had dismounted and, with his right hand resting on the carriage door, was responding to the interrogation of the barrier guard.</t6703>
<t6704>—Take your documents, Mauricio Lorry...</t6704> <t6705>Endorsed!</t6705>
<t6706>—Can we proceed with the journey?</t6706>
<t6707>—Whenever it suits you.</t6707> <t6708>Onward, postilions, and have a good journey.</t6708>
<t6709>—Greetings, citizens...</t6709> <t6710>The first danger has passed.</t6710>
<t6711>—Don't you think we are walking too slowly?—asked Lucía, crying, holding onto the embrace of good Lorry.</t6711>
<t6712>—If we ran faster, it would look like we were fleeing; it's not advisable; we would arouse suspicion.</t6712>
<t6713>—Look back... Are they not chasing us?</t6713>
<t6714>—No, my dear, no; so far they are not chasing us.</t6714>
<t6715>The fugitives leave behind one or two-story houses that line the road, farms, abandoned labor houses, ruined tanneries, lonely fields, avenues winding between rows of leafless trees.</t6715> <t6716>They run along rough and uneven paths, crossing thickets, sometimes jumping over thick layers of stones, sometimes getting stuck in deep mud pits.</t6716> <t6717>Their impatience, their agony is so great that they see nothing, notice nothing, think of nothing but reaching the port of salvation as soon as possible.</t6717>
<t6718>The horses are harnessed again.</t6718> <t6719>New postilions take the seats while the former ones rest.</t6719> <t6720>They pass through a village, laboriously climb a ramp, crest the hill, descend the opposite slope, and enter less arid lands...</t6720> <t6721>Good heavens! They are being chased!</t6721>
<t6722>—Ah, the carriage...! Stop!</t6722>
<t6723>—What's happening?—asks Lorry, sticking her head out the door.</t6723>
<t6724>—How many have there been today?</t6724>
<t6725>—I don't understand.</t6725>
<t6726>—How many have kissed the Holy Guillotine today?</t6726>
<t6727>—Fifty-two.</t6727>
<t6728>—Good! Good number!</t6728> <t6729>My good fellow citizens here would have liked to dispatch so many; but they were ten less...</t6729> <t6730>The Guillotine works admirably... Good for the Guillotine...!</t6730> <t6731>Long live the Guillotine...!</t6731> <t6732>I adore it...! Onward!</t6732>
<t6733>The night closes in.</t6733> <t6734>Carlos begins to move... he comes back to life... he says intelligible words.</t6734> <t6735>He thinks he is still next to Carton and asks him what he has in his hand...</t6735>
<t6736>God in Heaven! Have mercy on the fugitives!</t6736>
<t6737>Behind them flies the swift wind, behind them rush the clouds, behind them runs the moon, the shadows of the night follow them tirelessly; but, fortunately, until then, no one else runs in their pursuit.</t6737>
<t6738>Chapter XIV.</t6738>
<t6739>END OF THE SOCK</t6739>
<t6740>At the very hour when the fifty-two were awaiting the moment to form too close a relationship with the Guillotine, Madame Defarge, The Vengeance, and Jacques Three were holding a sinister secret council.</t6740> <t6741>The conference did not take place in the tavern, but in the wood-sawyer's workshop, who had once been a road mender, and he was not admitted to it, but forced to remain outside at a respectable distance.</t6741>
<t6742>—In any case, our Defarge is a good republican, isn't he?—asked Santiago the Third.</t6742>
<t6743>—There is none better in all of France—responded La Venganza warmly.</t6743>
<t6744>—Calm down, my dear Vengeance—replied the innkeeper, placing a hand on her lieutenant's arm and slightly furrowing her brow.</t6744><t6745>—Before expressing opinions, it's advisable that you listen to what I'm going to say.</t6745> <t6746>My husband, as a citizen, is a good republican and a man of valor; he has served the Republic well and has its trust; but my husband has his weaknesses, and one of the greatest, surely the greatest, is his fondness for the doctor.</t6746>
<t6747>—It's a disgrace!—exclaimed Santiago Tercero, shaking his head with an enigmatic expression.</t6747><t6748>—Those weaknesses are unbecoming of a good citizen... What a pity!</t6748>
<t6749>—What matters least to me is the doctor—replied the innkeeper.</t6749><t6750>—As for me, he can keep his head on his shoulders or lose it; it makes no difference to me; but the Evrémonde race must be exterminated, it must disappear from the earth, and consequently, the wife and daughter must follow the husband and father to the other world.</t6750>
<t6751>—And what a beautiful head it is, if there ever was one; a head that is screaming for the Guillotine—replied Santiago Tercero.</t6751><t6752>—There is nothing as thrilling as seeing a little head with blue eyes and golden hair hanging from the hands of our good Samson.</t6752>
<t6753>Mrs. Defarge lowered her eyes and remained in a reflective attitude for a few moments.</t6753>
<t6754>—The girl also has golden hair and blue eyes—replied Santiago Tercero.</t6754><t6755>—Moreover, we are rarely granted the pleasure of seeing girls of her age on the stage.</t6755> <t6756>It will be a magnificent spectacle.</t6756>
<t6757>—Speaking frankly—said the innkeeper's wife, shaking off her abstraction,—in this matter, I do not trust my husband.</t6757> <t6758>Not only am I convinced since last night that I should not confide the details of my plans to him, but also that, if we lose any time, he is very capable of warning them of the danger they are in, in which case, they will escape us.</t6758>
<t6759>—They won't escape, no... not one or half!—grumbled Santiago Tercero.</t6759><t6760>—They will all fall, to the last one!</t6760> <t6761>We must reach sixty daily!</t6761>
<t6762>—In a word—added the innkeeper's wife,—neither my husband has the reasons I do to demand the total extermination of that race, nor do I have the reasons he does to treat the doctor with consideration.</t6762> <t6763>Consequently, I must disregard him and act on my own.</t6763> <t6764>You may enter, citizen—she concluded, addressing the sawyer.</t6764>
<t6765>He obeyed, trembling, the sawyer, who appeared with the red cap in hand.</t6765>
<t6766>—Regarding the signals you saw that woman making to the prisoners, are you willing to support them with your statement at any time, citizen?—asked the innkeeper.</t6766>
<t6767>—Why not?</t6767> <t6768>From here, I have seen her every day, rainy or clear, cold or hot, from two in the afternoon until four, sometimes with the girl, other times alone, and always making signals.</t6768> <t6769>These very eyes have seen it.</t6769>
<t6770>While speaking, he made a great variety of gestures with his hands that I had never seen before.</t6770>
<t6771>—Plots... machinations... it's undeniable—replied Santiago Tercero.</t6771>
<t6772>—Can we count on the jury?—asked the innkeeper.</t6772>
<t6773>—Not at all.</t6773> <t6774>It is a patriotic jury, citizen.</t6774> <t6775>I vouch for all its members.</t6775>
<t6776>—Another thing...—added the innkeeper, pondering.</t6776><t6777>—Let's see.....</t6777> <t6778>Can I forgive the doctor for my husband's sake?</t6778> <t6779>It's all the same to me... the doctor is indifferent to me... Can I forgive him?</t6779>
<t6780>—It would be one more head—observed Santiago Tercero.</t6780><t6781>—Heads are beginning to be scarce... soon they will be even scarcer...</t6781> <t6782>I think it would be a shame to pardon him.</t6782>
<t6783>—When I found him in front of the place where we are, he was making the same signs as his daughter—said Mrs. Defarge.</t6783><t6784>—If I speak of one, I must necessarily speak of the other.</t6784> <t6785>On the other hand, it is not possible for me to remain silent, so I place all the responsibility of the case on this citizen.</t6785> <t6786>He will declare whatever he wants.</t6786> <t6787>As for me, the only thing I can say is that I will never be a false witness.</t6787>
<t6788>La Venganza and Santiago Tercero demonstrated as clear as daylight that, far from being a false witness, they had always been a mirror of admirable and wonderful witnesses, and the citizen sawyer, not wanting to be left behind, protested to heaven and earth that Mrs. Defarge was a celestial witness.</t6788>
<t6789>—Let his fate be fulfilled!—said the innkeeper.</t6789><t6790>—No; I cannot forgive him...</t6790> <t6791>I suppose, citizen, that you cannot make yourself available at three today, for I believe you won't deny yourself the pleasure of watching today's batch, right?</t6791>
<t6792>The sawyer immediately replied that he would not miss such a beautiful spectacle for anything in the world, which gave him the opportunity to add that he was the most fervent republican, and that he would consider himself the most desolate of republicans if one day he was prevented from smoking his pipe while watching the beautiful operation of the National Barber's Razor.</t6792>
<t6793>—I will also attend—replied the innkeeper.</t6793><t6794>—After the performance ends... at eight... yes; it's a good time... at eight you will come to find me at San Antonio to denounce those individuals in my section.</t6794>
<t6795>The sawyer replied that it would be a great honor and immense satisfaction for him to attend the appointment given by the lady.</t6795>
<t6796>Mrs. Defarge approached the workshop door, signaled to Santiago Tercero and La Venganza, and once they were by her side, she clearly explained her points of view to them.</t6796>
<t6797>—Surely she is at this moment in her house, waiting for the news of her husband's death—he said.</t6797><t6798>—In her pain and despair, she will not only mourn the misfortune that afflicts her, but she will also criticize the justice of the Republic.</t6798> <t6799>All her sympathies will be with the enemies of the people; thus, I will go to see her without losing a moment.</t6799>
<t6800>—What an admirable woman!</t6800> <t6801>What an adorable patriot!—exclaimed Santiago Tercero, whose enthusiasm reached the indescribable.</t6801>
<t6802>Revenge embraced her, crying in a rapture of admiration.</t6802>
<t6803>—Take my knitting—replied Madame Defarge, placing it in the hands of The Vengeance,—and have it ready for me in my usual seat.</t6803> <t6804>Go straight there, don't waste time, as it is almost certain that there will be more people than usual today.</t6804>
<t6805>—With all my soul, I will obey my boss's orders—answered La Venganza, kissing the barmaid on the cheek.</t6805><t6806>—Will you take long?</t6806>
<t6807>—I'll be there before the show starts.</t6807>
<t6808>—Try to arrive before the carts—replied La Venganza.</t6808>
<t6809>The tavern keeper left the workshop at a brisk pace, soon disappearing from sight.</t6809>
<t6810>Many were the women in that era whose moral silhouettes cannot be contemplated, despite the distance of time, without horror and disgust; but among them, there was none so inhuman, so fierce, so ruthless, as the one we now leave heading to the residence of the unfortunate Dr. Manette.</t6810> <t6811>She was a woman inaccessible to fear, inflexible, intelligent, cunning, and resolute, endowed with that special beauty that instills in the spirit of its possessor a firmness and animosity that forces others to pay instinctive homage to the expressed qualities.</t6811> <t6812>Had she lived in a less troubled time, had she moved in a different theater, who knows if she might have been the glory of her sex; but a victim from childhood of social injustices, grown in an atmosphere of implacable class hatred, she became a tiger.</t6812> <t6813>She was utterly devoid of pity; and if ever virtue nested in her soul, she had extirpated it many years before, leaving not a trace of it.</t6813>
<t6814>What did it matter that an innocent person died for sins committed by their ancestors?</t6814> <t6815>Her relentless fury did not see the first, but the last.</t6815> <t6816>Nor did it matter to leave a poor woman widowed or her daughter orphaned; rather, she considered the punishment insufficient since it involved her natural enemies, her prey, beings who had no right to live.</t6816> <t6817>Trying to appease her was useless, for she lacked the ability to feel compassion, not only for others but even for herself.</t6817> <t6818>If in any of the many encounters in which she took part she had fallen under the hand of her enemies, she would have accepted her misfortune as something natural and ordinary, and if they had forced her to climb the fatal staircase ending at the guillotine, she would have offered her neck without any other feelings arising in her fierce soul than a rabid desire to trade places with the man who sent her there.</t6818>
<t6819>Such was the heart that beat beneath the coarse dress of Madame Defarge.</t6819> <t6820>Dirty, ragged, it was still a dress, even if it presented a gloomy appearance, just as her abundant mass of black hair, poorly contained within the red cap, did not fail to offer some attraction.</t6820> <t6821>Hidden in her bosom she always carried a loaded pistol and at her waist a long, sharp dagger.</t6821> <t6822>Thus attired, walking with a confident step, with that freedom of movement typical of a woman who since childhood has gone wherever her desires or whims have taken her, barefoot and bare-legged, the tavern keeper Defarge left street after street behind her.</t6822>
<t6823>It will be necessary for us to make a small digression in order to clarify some points that the reader might find obscure.</t6823> <t6824>The previous night, when Lorry was finalizing the preparations for the fugitives' journey, the difficulty of bringing Miss Pross with him was a source of great concern for him.</t6824> <t6825>Not only was it highly desirable to avoid excess baggage that might hinder their progress, but also to minimize the time spent at the Barrier for examining documents and identifying travelers, as the salvation of all could depend on taking advantage of or losing mere seconds of time.</t6825> <t6826>After long considerations, and not without carefully weighing the disadvantages and advantages, he had proposed leaving Miss Pross and Jeremiah Lapa, who could leave the city whenever it suited them, with orders to start their journey at three in the morning, using one of the lightest carriages then known.</t6826> <t6827>Free from the encumbrance of luggage, they would soon catch up with the gentlemen, and might even leave them behind.</t6827>
<t6828>Miss Pross gladly accepted a proposition that offered her the opportunity to render some important service to her loved ones.</t6828> <t6829>She and Jeremiah had met the person whom her brother Solomon had brought in a fainting state in a carriage, had seen off the travelers, had spent ten minutes in terrible anxiety, and were making the final preparations to set off and catch up with the carriage at the moment when the tavern keeper Defarge was approaching the house, with intentions that the readers know perfectly well.</t6829>
<t6830>—What do you think, Mr. Lapa?—asked Miss Pross, whose agitation was so great that it neither let her speak, nor move, nor stand, nor live.</t6830><t6831>—What do you think of our trip?</t6831> <t6832>The departure of two carriages in such a short period of time is bound to arouse suspicion; at least, that is what I fear.</t6832>
<t6833>—My opinion, miss, is that you are right—replied Lapa—. I also believe that I will always support whatever you say, whether you are right or wrong.</t6833>
<t6834>—To such an extent do fear and hope for the fate of our masters drive me mad—replied Miss Pross, crying inconsolably,—that I am incapable of forming any rational plan.</t6834> <t6835>And you, Mr. Lorry, my dear Mr. Lorry, do you feel capable of forming any reasonably rational plan?</t6835>
<t6836>—Regarding the afterlife, miss, I believe so—replied Jeremiah Lapa;—but regarding the present use of this blessed head I carry on my shoulders, I fear not.</t6836> <t6837>Would you, miss, take charge of two promises or vows that I wish to make, as a perpetual reminder of the crisis we are in?</t6837>
<t6838>—God help us!—exclaimed Miss Pross, crying out loud.</t6838><t6839>—Make those vows or promises immediately, do them without losing a moment like the good Christian you are.</t6839>
<t6840>—The first thing I promise—said Lapa, trembling like a leaf and with a pathetic expression,—the first thing I swear, is never to do again some little things I used to do before... No; never again.</t6840>
<t6841>—I am quite sure, Mr. Lapa, that he will never do them again, whatever those little things may be, which do not need to be mentioned.</t6841>
<t6842>—No, miss; I will not mention them.</t6842> <t6843>The second thing I promise, the second thing I swear, is not to involve myself again in Mrs. Lapa's prayers.</t6843> <t6844>No; I will never again prevent her from spending her entire life on her knees.</t6844>
<t6845>—You will do very well.</t6845><t6846>—replied Miss Pross, drying the tears that blinded her.</t6846><t6847>—Let your wife take care of the household matters... Oh... my poor young lady!</t6847>
<t6848>—I believe it is appropriate to state, miss—replied Lapa as if he were speaking from the top of a pulpit,—and I would like you to convey my words to Mrs. Lapa, that my opinions regarding prayers have undergone a radical change, and that with all my heart I wish that Mrs. Lapa were on her knees and praying at this moment.</t6848>
<t6849>—Oh, yes!</t6849> <t6850>I hope she is praying, and I hope Heaven kindly listens to her prayers!</t6850>
<t6851>—I curse—continued Mr. Lapa with greater solemnity than ever—I curse everything I have done and said against the good souls who pray and spend their time on their knees!</t6851> <t6852>I curse all mortals who at this very moment are not on their knees and praying for the Lord to deliver us safely from this mortal danger in which we find ourselves!</t6852> <t6853>I curse, miss... I curse...!</t6853>
<t6854>The good Lapa lowered his head after searching in vain for a few seconds for something else to curse.</t6854>
<t6855>—If divine mercy wills that we ever reach our homeland—replied Miss Pross,—you can be absolutely certain that I will repeat to Mrs. Lapa everything you have just said in such eloquent language; and whatever happens, at all times you will find me ready to testify to your excellent intentions...</t6855> <t6856>But let us think, Mr. Lapa... let us think!</t6856>
<t6857>After a long period of deep meditation, Miss Pross said:</t6857>
<t6858>—Don't you think it would be wise, Mr. Lapa, to order the car to wait somewhere else instead of coming here?</t6858> <t6859>If you like my suggestion, you could go out to give the notice, and I would go to the agreed-upon spot.</t6859>
<t6860>Jeremías Lapa replied that the plan seemed right to him.</t6860>
<t6861>—Where could they be waiting for me?—asked Miss Pross.</t6861>
<t6862>So bewildered was Mr. Lapa that he could not think of a more suitable place than the sidewalk of the Temple Bar in London, next to Tellson's Bank.</t6862>
<t6863>Unfortunate luck!</t6863> <t6864>The Tribunal of the Temple was hundreds of miles away, while the innkeeper Defarge was very close to the house.</t6864>
<t6865>—Next to the cathedral door—said Miss Pross.</t6865><t6866>—Do you think the cathedral door, between the two towers, is a good spot?</t6866>
<t6867>—It seems unbeatable, miss.</t6867>
<t6868>—Then, go to the post house and give the appropriate orders.</t6868>
<t6869>—The only thing that worries me—said Lapa, scratching his head,—is leaving you.</t6869> <t6870>We don't know what might happen.</t6870>
<t6871>—Only God knows, it's true; but do not worry about me.</t6871> <t6872>Wait for me with the car at three o'clock sharp by the cathedral door, or as close as possible, which will certainly be less prone to mishaps than if we were to leave from here.</t6872> <t6873>God bless you, Mr. Lapa!</t6873> <t6874>Think not of our lives, which are of little value, but of the other more precious ones that probably depend on ours.</t6874>
<t6875>These words, and Miss Pross's attitude, who was extending her pleading hands towards him, finally convinced Lapa, who immediately left, ready to carry out the task.</t6875>
<t6876>It greatly helped to calm Miss Pross to see the precautionary measures being put into action.</t6876> <t6877>She also found comfort in the need to compose her outward appearance so as not to attract attention in the streets that could be dangerous.</t6877> <t6878>She checked the clock and saw that it was twenty past two.</t6878> <t6879>She couldn't afford to waste time.</t6879>
<t6880>Frightened at the thought of the loneliness in those deserted rooms, fearing to see eyes watching her from everywhere, gripped by unspeakable terrors, Miss Pross put cold water in a basin and began to wash her eyes, red and swollen from so much crying.</t6880> <t6881>Harassed by her apprehensions, she interrupted the washing every second to cast fearful glances around her.</t6881> <t6882>In one of those interruptions, she stepped back and let out a piercing scream, for she indeed discovered a person standing in the center of the room, looking at her.</t6882>
<t6883>The basin shattered into a thousand pieces, and the spilled water reached the bare feet of the innkeeper Defarge.</t6883> <t6884>Strangely enough, those feet, which were seeking blood, encountered water.</t6884>
<t6885>—Where is Evrémonde's wife?—asked the innkeeper coldly.</t6885>
<t6886>Quick as lightning, the idea struck Miss Pross's mind that the fact that all the doors were wide open would arouse suspicion of an escape plan.</t6886> <t6887>So she began by closing them all, and then positioned herself in front of the door leading to the room that Lucie had occupied until that day.</t6887>
<t6888>With a fiery gaze, the innkeeper Defarge followed all the movements of Miss Pross, fixing them on her face once she saw her motionless by the door.</t6888>
<t6889>Miss Pross was devoid of any kind of physical attractiveness.</t6889> <t6890>The years had not tamed her rustic roughness nor softened the sullen frown on her face.</t6890> <t6891>At the same time, she was a resolute woman; personal dangers did not frighten her, and far from being intimidated upon seeing Madame Defarge, she measured her from head to toe with a look of profound disdain.</t6891>
<t6892>—From your appearance, you could be the wife of Lucifer himself—Miss Pross said to herself.</t6892><t6893>—But if you think you scare me, you're mistaken; I am English.</t6893>
<t6894>The innkeeper's wife looked at her with contempt in her eyes, though understanding that she was facing a formidable enemy.</t6894> <t6895>She knew very well that Miss Pross was capable of losing her life for the doctor's family, just as Miss Pross knew that the innkeeper's wife, Defarge, was capable of any evil when it came to the indicated family.</t6895>
<t6896>—I was going to the place where I have a reserved seat—said Defarge, extending an arm towards the spot where the guillotine was set up,—and in passing, I wanted to congratulate the wife of Evrémonde.</t6896> <t6897>I need to see her.</t6897>
<t6898>—I know your intentions are bad, and you can certainly count on the fact that you will find in me someone who will oppose you in carrying them out—replied Miss Pross.</t6898>
<t6899>Each one spoke in their native tongue.</t6899> <t6900>Neither the barmaid understood a word of what Miss Pross was saying, nor did Miss Pross understand a word of what the barmaid was saying.</t6900> <t6901>However, they watched each other so intently that their gestures, their expressions, made the words intelligible that otherwise said nothing to their ears.</t6901>
<t6902>—Worse for her if you don't let me see her right now—replied the innkeeper.</t6902><t6903>—The good patriots will soon know what that means.</t6903> <t6904>I want to see her... I need to see her...</t6904> <t6905>Go and tell her that I won't leave here without seeing her.</t6905> <t6906>Don't you hear me?</t6906>
<t6907>—You insist on being left without eyes, and you are going to achieve it—replied Miss Pross.</t6907><t6908>—Look at me, look at me with those fierce beast eyes, but don't push your luck, because I have a short temper.</t6908> <t6909>You might come for wool and leave yours between my nails.</t6909>
<t6910>Of course, Madame Defarge did not understand a word of the phrases that have been copied, but she fully realized that her interlocutor flatly refused to obey her commands.</t6910>
<t6911>—Idiot... hungry pig face!—he muttered.</t6911><t6912>—I want to see Evrémonde's wife!</t6912> <t6913>Either you go tell her right now, or you step away from that door and let me through!</t6913>
<t6914>—I never imagined that I might need to understand that stupid language you speak; but the truth is that right now I would give everything I have, except the shirt on my back, to know if you suspect the whole truth or part of it.</t6914>
<t6915>The two women stared at each other intently.</t6915> <t6916>The innkeeper, who until now had not moved from the spot where Miss Pross saw her when she was washing her eyes, took a step forward.</t6916>
<t6917>—I am Breton and I am furious—said Miss Pross.</t6917><t6918>—I don't give a damn about my life.</t6918> <t6919>I know that the longer I delay you, the more I ensure my lady's salvation...</t6919> <t6920>If you come any closer, I assure you I won't leave a hair on that head of yours.</t6920>
<t6921>It was the sentimental nature of Miss Pross's courage, a courage that filled her eyes with tears.</t6921> <t6922>The tavern keeper, not very practical in matters of sentiment, mistook the tears for weakness.</t6922>
<t6923>—Ha, ha, ha, ha!</t6923> <t6924>Poor thing, and how little you're worth!—he exclaimed.</t6924><t6925>—I want nothing to do with you... Citizen doctor!—he shouted.</t6925><t6926>—Woman of Evrémonde, daughter of Evrémonde!</t6926> <t6927>Answer the citizen Defarge, miserable inhabitants of this house!</t6927>
<t6928>Perhaps the silence that followed her screams, perhaps the expression on Miss Pross's face, perhaps premonitions born in her dark soul, suggested to the innkeeper's wife the suspicion that the people whose blood she sought had fled.</t6928> <t6929>The fact was that of the four doors in the room she was in, she opened three and looked inside the rooms to which they gave access.</t6929>
<t6930>—I see everything in disarray, there is no one in these rooms, and I suspect that the one you guard is also deserted!</t6930> <t6931>I want to inspect it!—he shouted.</t6931>
<t6932>—Never!—responded Miss Pross, who understood the words of the landlady as well as the latter understood her response.</t6932>
<t6933>—If they are not in that room, they have left; and there is still time to pursue them and catch up with them—thought Defarge.</t6933>
<t6934>—As long as you don't find out whether they are in this room or not, you won't know what to do—Miss Pross said to herself;—and I assure you that you won't find out if it's in my power to prevent it.</t6934> <t6935>Another thing; you won't leave here as long as I have hands to hold you.</t6935>
<t6936>—I have not found a wall capable of blocking my way until today; be sure that I will tear you to pieces if you don't come out of that door—roared the innkeeper.</t6936>
<t6937>—We are alone in an interior room of a solitary house in a solitary neighborhood.</t6937> <t6938>It is not likely that they will hear us.</t6938> <t6939>You will not leave here, beast, for every minute I detain you is worth a world to my dear lady.</t6939>
<t6940>The innkeeper, having lost her patience, advanced resolutely towards the door.</t6940> <t6941>Miss Pross, guided by the instinct of the moment, grabbed her around the waist with both arms.</t6941> <t6942>In vain did the first try to resist and strike, for her antagonist, with that giant tenacity that love gives, always stronger than hate, not only held her but also lifted her off the ground in her arms.</t6942> <t6943>Defarge struggled furiously, slapped and slapped her enemy's face, scratched her mercilessly, but Miss Pross, who had lowered her head to defend herself, tightened the steel grip with which she imprisoned her waist more and more.</t6943>
<t6944>The hands of the innkeeper stopped pounding and dropped to her waist.</t6944>
<t6945>—Don't bother yourself—said Miss Pross;—it is under my arm and you won't be able to draw it.</t6945> <t6946>I am stronger than you, thank God, and I won't let you go until you faint or die.</t6946>
<t6947>Mrs. Defarge brought her right hand to her chest.</t6947> <t6948>Miss Pross saw the object that hand was drawing out.</t6948> <t6949>Quick as lightning, she raised an arm, struck a blow, and... a flash flared, thunder sounded, and she recoiled.</t6949> <t6950>The room was filled with smoke.</t6950>
<t6951>All of it lasted no more than a second.</t6951> <t6952>The smoke began to pour out of the window, carrying within its black spirals the soul of the woman who lay lifeless on the pavement.</t6952>
<t6953>The terribleness of the situation she found herself in made Miss Pross, at first, try to flee from the corpse and run down the stairs with the intention of seeking unnecessary and belated help; but fortunately, she realized the consequences in time to stop and retrace her steps.</t6953> <t6954>It was horrible to pass over the corpse, lying across the doorway; but she did so to retrieve the hat and other items she needed to take with her.</t6954> <t6955>She took them to the landing of the stairs, locked the door, sat down to let the terror that was choking her escape through her eyes, and once calmer, she got up and left.</t6955>
<t6956>Fortunately for her, the veil of the hat was quite thick, because otherwise, it is likely that she would have been detained on the street.</t6956> <t6957>Fortunately for her, she was so ugly that the deep scratches she had received in the fight did not leave marks on her face that would have been left on another face more favored by nature.</t6957>
<t6958>Upon crossing the bridge, she threw the house key into the river.</t6958> <t6959>She arrived in front of the cathedral door a few minutes before the time agreed upon with Lapa, and waited, filled with terror, at the thought that they might fish out the key she had just thrown, discover which house it belonged to, open the door, find a corpse, arrest her, and condemn her to death for the crime of murder.</t6959> <t6960>Such were the thoughts that agitated her when Lapa arrived.</t6960>
<t6961>—Is there noise in the streets?—asked Miss Pross.</t6961>
<t6962>—The ordinary one—Lapa replied, not a little surprised both by the question and by the appearance of the one who asked it.</t6962>
<t6963>—I can't hear you... What are you saying?</t6963>
<t6964>In vain did Lapa repeat over and over what he had said; Miss Pross did not hear him.</t6964>
<t6965>—Wow!—thought Lapa.</t6965><t6966>—I will make myself understood through gestures.</t6966>
<t6967>—Is there noise in the streets?</t6967>
<t6968>Lapa nodded affirmatively.</t6968>
<t6969>—I don't hear anything.</t6969>
<t6970>—Deaf as a post in an hour?</t6970> <t6971>That's strange!—thought Lapa—What could have happened to her?</t6971>
<t6972>—I saw a lightning bolt, I heard a thunderclap; and the thunderclap was the last thing I heard in my life—explained Miss Pross.</t6972>
<t6973>—I find her completely changed...</t6973> <t6974>What could she have taken to gain courage?</t6974> <t6975>Because the truth is she doesn't seem to have a bit of fear...</t6975> <t6976>The noise of those damn carts...! Do you hear them, miss?</t6976>
<t6977>—I can't hear anything, absolutely nothing—replied the good Pross, noticing the movement of her companion's lips.</t6977><t6978>—A lightning, a thunder, and nothing more.</t6978>
<t6979>—If he doesn't hear the rumbling of those horrible carts, I think he won't hear anything else in this world again—murmured Lapa.</t6979>
<t6980>He was not mistaken.</t6980> <t6981>Miss Pross remained deaf forever.</t6981>
<t6982>XV.</t6982>
<t6983>THE ECHOES FADE AWAY FOREVER</t6983>
<t6984>The vehicles of death bounce on the cobblestones of the streets of Paris, creaking lugubriously.</t6984> <t6985>Six carts carry to the guillotine the ration of wine with which it daily entertains its thirst.</t6985> <t6986>The devouring monsters, the insatiable monsters that human imaginations have forged since the very first moment of their activity, have merged into a unique realization, and this unique realization is called the guillotine.</t6986> <t6987>And yet, in France, with all its rich variety of climate and soil, there is not a blade of grass, a leaf, a root, a shoot, capable of reaching ripeness and maturity under more favorable conditions than those that produced that horror.</t6987> <t6988>The day that similar hammers crush and pound humanity, twisting it and erasing its form, it will reappear under the same violent and misshapen forms under which it reappeared then; the day the seed of rapacious license and oppression is sown, the same fruits that flourished and ripened then will flourish and ripen.</t6988>
<t6989>Six carts roll creaking along the streets.</t6989> <t6990>Transform them into what they once were, you, Time, powerful enchanter, reintegrate them to their former shape and condition, and we will see them changed into as many splendid carriages of absolute monarchs, into trains of noble feudal lords, into luxurious galas of dazzling Jezebels, into Synagogues that have ceased to be the House of My Father to become dens of thieves, into miserable huts of millions of famished peasants!</t6990> <t6991>No; the great magician who majestically disrupts the order established by the Creator, never destroys his transformations.</t6991> <t6992>"If the will of God has given you the form you affect, do not attempt to change it; but if you owe it to transient human conspiracies, regain the one you received from the Most High," say the magicians to the enchanted beings in the Arabian tales.</t6992>
<t6993>The shadowy wheels of the carts, as they turn over the cobblestones, resemble a powerful plow that opens a deep furrow among the populace that fills the streets, with human heads on either side.</t6993> <t6994>The neighbors of the houses are so accustomed to the horrendous spectacle that not a single face is seen on many balconies, and it is very common to see people engaged in some occupation who do not stop the movement of their hands as the carts pass, although their eyes turn to the carts to see who the unfortunate ones occupying them are.</t6994>
<t6995>Among those who ride the fateful carts, there are some who observe their surroundings with an impassive gaze and others who focus on it with fleeting interest.</t6995> <t6996>Some give palpable signs of silent despair, making the final journey with their heads bowed over their chests, while others hold them arrogantly high and cast looks of haughty disdain at the crowds.</t6996> <t6997>Many meditate or try to gather their wandering thoughts, closing their eyes for that purpose, while one, just one, a wretched being of repulsive appearance, seems so crazed with terror that he sings and even tries to dance.</t6997> <t6998>The expressions of the condemned vary infinitely, but not a single one awakens pity in the diamond-hard hearts of the people.</t6998>
<t6999>Some riders with a brutish appearance break the march, to whom the curious occasionally direct questions.</t6999> <t7000>Undoubtedly, these are always the same, as the answer invariably leads to a movement of the crowds towards the third cart.</t7000> <t7001>The riders with brutish faces who ride ahead also frequently point with the tips of their sabers to a man among those occupying it.</t7001> <t7002>The condemned man in question has aroused general curiosity; everyone wants to know who the man is who, with his back against the backrest of the third cart, is conversing with a little girl sitting beside him.</t7002> <t7003>He does not seem interested in the scene nor does he care about anything around him.</t7003> <t7004>In the street of San Honorato, the crowds shout against him; he responds to the shouts with a smile and energetic head movements that further dishevel his long hair, fallen over his face, which he cannot move away because his arms are tied.</t7004>
<t7005>At the top of a church's staircase, the spy whom Sydney Carton called the hangman's blackbird awaits the passing of the funeral procession.</t7005> <t7006>He fixes his gaze on the first cart: he is not there.</t7006> <t7007>He anxiously looks at the second... Neither there.</t7007> <t7008>His face reflects the fear that begins to invade him, but when he scrutinizes the third, he smiles with satisfaction.</t7008>
<t7009>—Who is Evrémonde?—asks a man positioned behind him.</t7009>
<t7010>—That one... the one from the third cart.</t7010>
<t7011>—The one who talks with the girl?</t7011>
<t7012>—Yes.</t7012>
<t7013>—Die, Evrémonde!—immediately shouts the man in question.</t7013><t7014>—To the guillotine with all the aristocrats! Die, Evrémonde!</t7014>
<t7015>—Quiet... quiet...!—the spy exclaims timidly.</t7015>
<t7016>—Why should I be silent?</t7016>
<t7017>—Because he is about to pay for his crimes...</t7017> <t7018>In five minutes, he will have atoned for them... Leave him alone now.</t7018>
<t7019>—Die, Evrémonde!—continues shouting that barbarian.</t7019>
<t7020>Evrémonde turns his face towards the one who is shouting; he sees the spy, looks at him attentively, and continues on his way undaunted.</t7020>
<t7021>The city clocks are about to strike three, and the plow veers off the straight path to reach the designated execution site.</t7021> <t7022>The lines of human heads that flanked the furrow opened by the plow up to that point gather in a throng around the guillotine that is about to be put into operation.</t7022> <t7023>In the front row, comfortably seated in chairs, exactly as if they were at the theater, there is a group of women, knitting with true fervor; among them, it was not difficult to spot La Vengeance, who seems restless and nervous.</t7023>
<t7024>—Teresa!—she shouts, appealing to her most shrill register.</t7024><t7025>—Who has seen Teresa... Teresa Defarge?</t7025>
<t7026>—It's the first time she's missed—replies one of the workers.</t7026>
<t7027>—No... it won't be missing today either...! Teresa!—roars La Venganza.</t7027>
<t7028>—Scream louder—advises the woman who spoke earlier.</t7028>
<t7029>Ah! Scream, Vengeance, scream: for as loud as your screams may be, it is difficult for you to be heard! Scream, Vengeance, scream... it doesn't matter if you accompany your screams with curses; neither the screams nor the curses will reach the ears of your boss!</t7029> <t7030>Send emissaries to search for her everywhere; even though it cannot be denied that these emissaries have accomplished difficult tasks, it is certain that they will not go to look for her where she is!</t7030> <t7031>She has made a journey too long!</t7031>
<t7032>—Bad luck!—silences La Venganza, furiously kicking—And the carts are already here...!</t7032> <t7033>And Evrémonde will be dispatched without her being here!</t7033>
<t7034>While Vengeance calls out loudly for Teresa Defarge, the carts are unloaded.</t7034> <t7035>The ministers of Saint Guillotine are dressed and ready to work...</t7035> <t7036>A blow is heard, a head rolls which one of the ministers immediately lifts in his hand, and the women, barely looking, continue knitting, saying as their only comment:</t7036>
<t7037>—One.</t7037>
<t7038>The scene repeats several times, without the women interrupting their work or stopping their counting.</t7038>
<t7039>The supposed Evrémonde ascends the fatal platform, holding the hand of the unfortunate girl, as he had promised, placing her with her back to the terrible blade, which rises and falls without interruption.</t7039>
<t7040>—If it hadn't been for you, my dear stranger, I wouldn't have the calm and resignation that I have, for I am a poor girl and my heart is weak.</t7040> <t7041>Nor would I have known how to elevate my thoughts towards Him who died for us, to Him whose mercy is today my only hope.</t7041> <t7042>I believe that it is the Heavens that have sent you to me on this day of trial.</t7042>
<t7043>—Perhaps you are the messenger that the Heavens have sent to me—replied Carton.</t7043><t7044>—Fix your eyes on me, dear girl, and forget everything else.</t7044>
<t7045>—As long as I have yours in my hands, I will be calm; and if I have to let go to embark on the journey, if the blow is swift, I will not fear it either.</t7045>
<t7046>—The strike will be swift; don't worry.</t7046>
<t7047>Although they were among the other victims, they spoke with as much freedom as if they had been alone.</t7047> <t7048>Those two children of the Universal Mother, unknown to each other until then, were going to make the final journey together, to appear together before the Creator, to rest together in Heaven.</t7048>
<t7049>—Brave and generous friend!—exclaimed the girl—May I ask you a question?</t7049> <t7050>I am very ignorant, and it is about something that troubles and mortifies me... a little bit.</t7050>
<t7051>—Ask whatever you want.</t7051>
<t7052>—I have a cousin, my only relative, an orphan like me, whom I love very much.</t7052> <t7053>She is five years younger than I am and lives in a farmhouse, in the South.</t7053> <t7054>Poverty separated us; she is unaware of my misfortune and I cannot write to her... and even if I could... what would I say?</t7054> <t7055>It is better this way.</t7055>
<t7056>—It's true: it's better this way.</t7056>
<t7057>—What I have been thinking while they were bringing us here, and what I continued thinking now, is the following: if the Republic is truly to bring happiness to the poor, if thanks to it they suffer less hunger and their suffering is alleviated, my cousin may still live many years; it is even possible that she might grow old.</t7057>
<t7058>—And what, my dear little sister?</t7058>
<t7059>—If that is so, don't you think the wait will feel very long for me, there in that better world where I trust to be mercifully welcomed with you, in that world where you, she, and I will live eternally?</t7059>
<t7060>—No, my daughter, no; in that better world you allude to, Time does not exist, nor is there room for suffering.</t7060>
<t7061>—How much your words console me!</t7061> <t7062>I am so ignorant!</t7062> <t7063>Should I kiss you now?</t7063> <t7064>Has the moment arrived?</t7064>
<t7065>—Yes, my daughter, yes.</t7065>
<t7066>The girl kisses Sydney Carton's lips and Sydney Carton kisses the girl's lips.</t7066> <t7067>Their hands do not tremble as they part.</t7067> <t7068>"Goodbye."</t7068> <t7069>The girl's head rolls first...</t7069> <t7070>The women who knit count TWENTY-TWO.</t7070>
<t7071>"I am the Resurrection and the Life; he who believes in Me, though he may die, shall live eternally; and whoever lives and believes in Me shall never die."</t7071>
<t7072>The blade descends again, and the women count; TWENTY-THREE.</t7072>
<t7073>That night, nothing else was talked about in the city.</t7073> <t7074>Everyone said they had never seen a human face that reflected so much calm, so much serenity of spirit.</t7074> <t7075>Many added that his appearance was sublime and that a prophetic light shone in his eyes.</t7075>
<t7076>Some time before, one of the most notable victims of the guillotine, a woman, had written down, placed upon the dreadful platform, the thoughts that the horrible machine inspired in her.</t7076> <t7077>If Sydney Carton had given sensible expression to his own, and if they had been prophetic, they would have been the following:</t7077>
<t7078>"I see Barsad, Cly, Defarge, La Vengeance, the Jurors, the Judges, all the new oppressors of humanity who have risen terribly to destroy the old ones, fall under the sharp blade of the just instrument.</t7078> <t7079>I see from the depths of the black abyss a beautiful city and an educated people emerge, who, in their struggles for true freedom, in their triumphs and defeats, atone, for many long years, for the horrors of the current era and those of previous eras, and eventually erase them."</t7079>
<t7080>"I see the lives of those for whom I give my own, gliding peacefully, prosperously, and happily, in that England that my eyes will never see again."</t7080> <t7081>I see her gently rocking in her lap a child who bears my name.</t7081> <t7082>I see her father bowed under the weight of years, but providing until the last moment of his life the aid of his science to his fellow men.</t7082> <t7083>I see the good old man, who for so many years has been her tender and selfless friend, enriching them with all he possesses and flying to the world where the reward awaits him that his virtues have earned him.</t7083>
<t7084>"I see that in their hearts they have erected an altar for me, and that this altar is passed down to their descendants, and that, many generations later, all the descendants of that beloved family pay sincere homage to the memory of the man who sacrificed his life for the sake of a sacred affection."</t7084> <t7085>I see her, already very old, crying for me on every anniversary of my death.</t7085> <t7086>I see her and her husband, sleeping in the earth the final sleep, and I know that, even after death, they honor and exalt my memory.</t7086>
<t7087>"I see the child she rocked in her lap, who bears my name, grown into a strong man making his way in the world, dedicated to the career that was once mine, and doing so brilliantly, that the glows illuminating his name also illuminate mine."</t7087> <t7088>I see the stains that tarnished the brilliance of my soul erased.</t7088> <t7089>I see the illustrious lawyer who bears my name, the most just of judges on earth, who has earned the respect and admiration of his fellow citizens, now old, very old, with a golden-haired child on his unsteady knees, who also bears my name, and narrating my story in a faltering voice.</t7089>
<t7090>"A thousand times more beautiful is what I do now than what I ever did."</t7090>
<t7091>"The holy bliss that my soul now savors, I would never have found on earth."</t7091>
<t7092>END</t7092>
