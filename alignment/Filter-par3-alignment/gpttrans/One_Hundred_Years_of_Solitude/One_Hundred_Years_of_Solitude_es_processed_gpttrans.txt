<t0>For Jomí García Ascot</t0>
<t1>and María Luisa Elío</t1>
<t2>Many years later, as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buendía was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice.</t2> <t3>Macondo was then a village of twenty mud and reed houses built on the bank of a river of clear water that rushed along a bed of polished stones, white and enormous like prehistoric eggs.</t3> <t4>The world was so recent that many things lacked names, and to mention them one had to point at them with a finger.</t4> <t5>Every year, in the month of March, a family of ragged gypsies would set up their tent near the village, and with a great uproar of flutes and drums they would announce the new inventions.</t5> <t6>First, they brought the magnet.</t6> <t7>A burly gypsy, with a wild beard and sparrow-like hands, who introduced himself as Melquíades, made a gruesome public demonstration of what he himself called the eighth wonder of the learned alchemists of Macedonia.</t7> <t8>He went from house to house dragging two metal ingots, and everyone was terrified to see that the pots, pans, tongs, and braziers fell from their places, and the woodwork creaked from the desperation of the nails and screws trying to unfasten themselves, and even objects long lost appeared where they had been most searched for, and they trailed in a turbulent stampede behind Melquíades' magical irons.</t8> <t9>"Things have a life of their own," the gypsy proclaimed with a harsh accent, "it's simply a matter of waking up their souls."</t9> <t10>José Arcadio Buendía, whose unbridled imagination always went beyond the ingenuity of nature, and even beyond miracle and magic, thought it was possible to use that useless invention to extract gold from the earth.</t10> <t11>Melquíades, who was an honest man, warned him: "It won't work for that."</t11> <t12>But José Arcadio Buendía did not believe in the honesty of the gypsies at that time, so he traded his mule and a batch of goats for the two magnetized ingots.</t12> <t13>Úrsula Iguarán, his wife, who counted on those animals to expand the meager domestic assets, could not dissuade him.</t13> <t14>"Very soon we will have so much gold that we can pave the house with it," her husband replied.</t14> <t15>For several months he endeavored to prove the accuracy of his conjectures.</t15> <t16>He explored the region inch by inch, including the riverbed, dragging the two iron ingots and reciting Melquíades' incantation aloud.</t16> <t17>The only thing he managed to unearth was a fifteenth-century armor with all its parts soldered together by a crust of rust, whose interior had the hollow resonance of an enormous gourd filled with stones.</t17> <t18>When José Arcadio Buendía and the four men of his expedition managed to disassemble the armor, they found inside a calcified skeleton that wore a copper locket with a woman's curl around its neck.</t18>
<t19>In March, the gypsies returned.</t19><t20>This time they brought a telescope and a magnifying glass the size of a drum, which they exhibited as the latest discovery of the Jews of Amsterdam.</t20><t21>They seated a gypsy woman at one end of the village and set up the telescope at the entrance of the tent.</t21><t22>For the payment of five reales, people would look through the telescope and see the gypsy woman within arm's reach.</t22><t23>“Science has eliminated distances,” Melquíades proclaimed.</t23><t24>“Soon, man will be able to see what happens anywhere on earth without leaving his home.”</t24><t25>One scorching midday, they made an astonishing demonstration with the gigantic magnifying glass: they placed a pile of dry grass in the middle of the street and set it on fire by concentrating the sun's rays.</t25><t26>José Arcadio Buendía, who had not yet consoled himself for the failure of his magnets, conceived the idea of using that invention as a weapon of war.</t26><t27>Melquíades, once again, tried to dissuade him.</t27><t28>But he ended up accepting the two magnetized ingots and three pieces of colonial money in exchange for the magnifying glass.</t28><t29>Úrsula cried in dismay.</t29><t30>That money was part of a chest of gold coins that her father had accumulated over a lifetime of hardships, and which she had buried under the bed waiting for a good opportunity to invest it.</t30><t31>José Arcadio Buendía did not even try to console her, wholly dedicated to his tactical experiments with the devotion of a scientist and even at the risk of his own life.</t31><t32>Trying to demonstrate the effects of the magnifying glass on the enemy troops, he exposed himself to the concentration of the sun's rays and suffered burns that turned into ulcers and took a long time to heal.</t32><t33>In response to his wife's protests, alarmed by such dangerous inventiveness, he almost set the house on fire.</t33><t34>He spent long hours in his room, making calculations about the strategic possibilities of his novel weapon, until he managed to compose a manual of astonishing didactic clarity and irresistible persuasive power.</t34><t35>He sent it to the authorities accompanied by numerous testimonies about his experiences and several sheets of explanatory drawings, in the care of a messenger who crossed the mountains, got lost in vast swamps, navigated stormy rivers, and nearly perished under the scourge of wild beasts, despair, and plague, before finding a route to connect with the mail mules.</t35><t36>Despite the fact that the journey to the capital was almost impossible at that time, José Arcadio Buendía promised to attempt it as soon as the government ordered him to, in order to make practical demonstrations of his invention before the military powers, and personally train them in the complicated arts of solar warfare.</t36><t37>For several years he awaited a response.</t37><t38>Finally, tired of waiting, he lamented to Melquíades about the failure of his initiative, and the gypsy then gave a convincing proof of honesty: he returned the doubloons in exchange for the magnifying glass, and also left him some Portuguese maps and several navigation instruments.</t38><t39>In his own handwriting, he wrote a concise summary of the studies of the monk Hermann, which he left at his disposal so that he could use the astrolabe, the compass, and the sextant.</t39><t40>José Arcadio Buendía spent the long months of rain locked in a small room he built at the back of the house so that no one would disturb his experiments.</t40><t41>Having completely abandoned domestic obligations, he spent entire nights in the courtyard watching the course of the stars, and nearly suffered a sunstroke trying to establish an exact method to find noon.</t41><t42>When he became an expert in the use and handling of his instruments, he had a notion of space that allowed him to navigate unknown seas, visit uninhabited territories, and establish relationships with splendid beings, without needing to leave his study.</t42><t43>It was during this time that he acquired the habit of talking to himself, walking around the house without paying attention to anyone, while Úrsula and the children broke their backs in the garden tending to the plantain and the malanga, the cassava and the yam, the squash and the eggplant.</t43><t44>Suddenly, without any warning, his feverish activity was interrupted and replaced by a kind of fascination.</t44><t45>He spent several days as if enchanted, repeating to himself in a low voice a string of astonishing conjectures, unable to believe his own understanding.</t45><t46>Finally, one Tuesday in December, at lunchtime, he suddenly released the full burden of his torment.</t46><t47>The children would remember for the rest of their lives the august solemnity with which their father sat at the head of the table, trembling with fever, devastated by prolonged wakefulness and the fury of his imagination, and revealed his discovery to them:</t47>
<t48>—The Earth is round like an orange.</t48>
<t49>Úrsula lost her patience.</t49> <t50>“If you are going to go crazy, go crazy by yourself,” she shouted.</t50> <t51>“But don’t try to instill your gypsy ideas in the children.”</t51> <t52>José Arcadio Buendía, unperturbed, was not intimidated by his wife’s desperation, who in a fit of rage smashed the astrolabe against the ground.</t52> <t53>He built another one, gathered the men of the village in the little room, and demonstrated to them, with theories that were incomprehensible to everyone, the possibility of returning to the starting point by always sailing eastward.</t53> <t54>The entire village was convinced that José Arcadio Buendía had lost his mind, when Melquíades arrived to set things straight.</t54> <t55>He publicly praised the intelligence of that man who, through pure astronomical speculation, had constructed a theory already proven in practice, although previously unknown in Macondo, and as a token of his admiration, he gave him a gift that would have a decisive influence on the future of the village: an alchemy laboratory.</t55>
<t56>By that time, Melquíades had aged with astonishing rapidity.</t56> <t57>In his early travels, he seemed to be the same age as José Arcadio Buendía.</t57> <t58>But while the latter retained his enormous strength, which allowed him to bring down a horse by grabbing it by the ears, the gypsy seemed ravaged by a tenacious ailment.</t58> <t59>It was, in reality, the result of multiple and rare diseases contracted during his countless journeys around the world.</t59> <t60>According to what he himself told José Arcadio Buendía while helping him set up the laboratory, death followed him everywhere, sniffing at his pants, but without deciding to give him the final blow.</t60> <t61>He was a fugitive from all the plagues and catastrophes that had scourged humankind.</t61> <t62>He survived pellagra in Persia, scurvy in the Malaysian archipelago, leprosy in Alexandria, beriberi in Japan, the bubonic plague in Madagascar, the earthquake in Sicily, and a massive shipwreck in the Strait of Magellan.</t62> <t63>That prodigious being who claimed to possess the keys of Nostradamus was a gloomy man, wrapped in a sad aura, with an Asiatic gaze that seemed to know the other side of things.</t63> <t64>He wore a large black hat, like the outspread wings of a crow, and a velvet vest patinated by the verdigris of centuries.</t64> <t65>But despite his immense wisdom and mysterious aura, he had a human weight, an earthly condition that kept him entangled in the minute problems of everyday life.</t65> <t66>He complained of old-age ailments, suffered from the most insignificant economic mishaps, and had stopped laughing a long time ago because scurvy had taken his teeth.</t66> <t67>The stifling midday when he revealed his secrets, José Arcadio Buendía was certain that this was the beginning of a great friendship.</t67> <t68>The children were astonished by his fantastic tales.</t68> <t69>Aureliano, who was no more than five years old at the time, would remember him for the rest of his life as he saw him that afternoon, sitting against the metallic and shimmering light of the window, illuminating with his deep organ-like voice the darkest territories of the imagination, while melted grease dripped down his temples from the heat.</t69> <t70>José Arcadio, his older brother, would pass on that marvelous image, like a hereditary memory, to all his descendants.</t70> <t71>Úrsula, on the other hand, retained a bad memory of that visit because she entered the room just as Melquíades accidentally broke a bottle of mercuric chloride.</t71>
<t72>—It's the smell of the devil —she said.</t72>
<t73>—Not at all —corrected Melquíades—.</t73> <t74>It is proven that the devil has sulfuric properties, and this is nothing more than a bit of calomel.</t74>
<t75>Always didactic, he gave a wise exposition on the diabolical virtues of cinnabar, but Úrsula paid no attention to him and took the children to pray.</t75> <t76>That biting smell would remain forever in her memory, linked to the memory of Melquíades.</t76>
<t77>The rudimentary laboratory—aside from a profusion of pots, funnels, retorts, filters, and strainers—was composed of a primitive athanor; a long-necked, narrow glass test tube, an imitation of the philosophical egg, and a distiller built by the gypsies themselves according to modern descriptions of Maria the Jewess's three-armed alembic.</t77> <t78>In addition to these things, Melquíades left samples of the seven metals corresponding to the seven planets, the formulas of Moses and Zosimos for the doubling of gold, and a series of notes and drawings on the processes of the Great Work, which allowed anyone who knew how to interpret them to attempt the manufacture of the philosopher's stone.</t78> <t79>Seduced by the simplicity of the formulas for doubling gold, José Arcadio Buendía courted Úrsula for several weeks, so that she would allow him to unearth her colonial coins and multiply them as many times as it was possible to subdivide the mercury.</t79> <t80>Úrsula yielded, as she always did, to her husband's unyielding obstinacy.</t80> <t81>Then José Arcadio Buendía threw thirty doubloons into a pot and melted them with copper shavings, orpiment, sulfur, and lead.</t81> <t82>He set everything to boil over a high flame in a castor oil cauldron until he obtained a thick, foul-smelling syrup more akin to common caramel than to magnificent gold.</t82> <t83>In hazardous and desperate distillation processes, melted with the seven planetary metals, worked with hermetic mercury and Cypriot vitriol, and cooked again in lard for lack of radish oil, Úrsula's precious inheritance was reduced to a charred chicharrón that could not be removed from the bottom of the cauldron.</t83>
<t84>When the gypsies returned, Úrsula had predisposed the entire population against them.</t84> <t85>But curiosity overcame fear, because this time the gypsies roamed the village making a deafening noise with all kinds of musical instruments, while the town crier announced the exhibition of the most fabulous discovery of the nasciancenos.</t85> <t86>So everyone went to the tent, and for the payment of a cent they saw a youthful Melquíades, recovered, unwrinkled, with a new and radiant set of teeth.</t86> <t87>Those who remembered his gums destroyed by scurvy, his flaccid cheeks, and his withered lips shuddered with fear at this conclusive proof of the gypsy's supernatural powers.</t87> <t88>The fear turned into panic when Melquíades took out his teeth, intact, set in his gums, and showed them to the public for a moment—a fleeting moment in which he became the same decrepit man of previous years—and then put them back in and smiled again with full control of his restored youth.</t88> <t89>Even José Arcadio Buendía himself considered that Melquíades' knowledge had reached intolerable extremes, but he experienced a healthy delight when the gypsy explained to him in private the mechanism of his false teeth.</t89> <t90>It seemed to him both so simple and prodigious that overnight he lost all interest in alchemical investigations; he suffered a new crisis of bad temper, stopped eating regularly, and spent the day wandering around the house.</t90> <t91>“In the world, incredible things are happening,” he told Úrsula.</t91> <t92>“Right there, on the other side of the river, there are all kinds of magical devices, while we continue living like donkeys.”</t92> <t93>Those who had known him since the founding of Macondo were amazed at how much he had changed under the influence of Melquíades.</t93>
<t94>In the beginning, José Arcadio Buendía was a sort of youthful patriarch, who gave instructions for planting and advice on raising children and animals, and collaborated with everyone, even in physical labor, for the good progress of the community.</t94> <t95>Since his house was from the very beginning the best in the village, the others were arranged in its image and likeness.</t95> <t96>It had a spacious and well-lit living room, a terrace-shaped dining room with brightly colored flowers, two bedrooms, a patio with a gigantic chestnut tree, a well-planted garden, and a pen where goats, pigs, and chickens lived together in peaceful community.</t96> <t97>The only animals prohibited not only in the house but in the entire village were fighting cocks.</t97>
<t98>Úrsula's industriousness matched that of her husband.</t98> <t99>Active, petite, severe, that woman of unbreakable nerves, who was never heard singing at any moment in her life, seemed to be everywhere from dawn until late at night, always followed by the soft rustle of her muslin skirts.</t99> <t100>Thanks to her, the beaten earth floors, the unwhitewashed mud walls, and the rustic wooden furniture they had built themselves were always clean, and the old chests where the clothes were stored exuded a warm scent of basil.</t100>
<t101>José Arcadio Buendía, who was the most enterprising man ever seen in the village, had arranged the position of the houses in such a way that from all of them one could reach the river and get water with equal effort, and he laid out the streets so well that no house received more sun than another at the hottest time of the day.</t101> <t102>In a few years, Macondo became a more orderly and industrious village than any known until then by its 300 inhabitants.</t102> <t103>It was truly a happy village, where no one was older than thirty years and where no one had died.</t103>
<t104>Since the time of the founding, José Arcadio Buendía built traps and cages.</t104> <t105>In a short time, he filled not only his own house but all the houses in the village with orioles, canaries, bluebirds, and robins.</t105> <t106>The concert of so many different birds became so overwhelming that Úrsula plugged her ears with beeswax to avoid losing her sense of reality.</t106> <t107>The first time Melquíades' tribe arrived selling glass balls for headaches, everyone was surprised that they had been able to find that village lost in the swamp's drowsiness, and the gypsies confessed that they had been guided by the birds' singing.</t107>
<t108>That spirit of social initiative disappeared in a short time, swept away by the fever of magnets, astronomical calculations, dreams of transmutation, and the desire to know the wonders of the world.</t108> <t109>From enterprising and neat, José Arcadio Buendía turned into a man of lazy appearance, careless in his dress, with a wild beard that Úrsula managed to trim with great difficulty using a kitchen knife.</t109> <t110>There were those who considered him a victim of some strange spell.</t110> <t111>But even the most convinced of his madness abandoned work and families to follow him, when he shouldered his clearing tools, and asked for everyone's help to open a path that would connect Macondo with the great inventions.</t111>
<t112>José Arcadio Buendía was completely ignorant of the region's geography.</t112> <t113>He knew that to the east was the impenetrable mountain range, and on the other side of the range was the ancient city of Riohacha, where in past times —according to what the first Aureliano Buendía, his grandfather, had told him—</t113> <t114>Sir Francis Drake engaged in the sport of hunting alligators with cannon shots, which he then had patched up and stuffed with straw to take them to Queen Elizabeth.</t114> <t115>In his youth, he and his men, with women and children and animals and all kinds of household goods, crossed the mountain range seeking an outlet to the sea, and after twenty-six months they gave up the endeavor and founded Macondo to avoid having to make the return journey.</t115> <t116>It was, therefore, a route that did not interest him, because it could only lead him to the past.</t116> <t117>To the south were the swamps, covered with an eternal layer of vegetation, and the vast universe of the great swamp, which according to the gypsies' testimony, had no limits.</t117> <t118>The great swamp merged to the west with a boundless aquatic expanse, where there were delicate-skinned cetaceans with the head and torso of a woman, who led sailors astray with the enchantment of their enormous breasts.</t118> <t119>The gypsies navigated for six months along this route before reaching the belt of solid ground where the mail mules passed.</t119> <t120>According to José Arcadio Buendía's calculations, the only possibility of contact with civilization was the northern route.</t120> <t121>So he equipped the same men who had accompanied him in the founding of Macondo with clearing tools and hunting weapons; he packed his orientation instruments and maps into a backpack, and embarked on the daring adventure.</t121>
<t122>The first days they did not encounter any appreciable obstacles.</t122> <t123>They descended along the rocky riverbank to the place where years before they had found the warrior's armor, and there they entered the forest through a path of wild orange trees.</t123> <t124>At the end of the first week, they killed and roasted a deer, but they settled for eating half and salting the rest for the coming days.</t124> <t125>They tried to delay with this precaution the need to continue eating macaws, whose blue meat had a harsh musk flavor.</t125> <t126>Then, for more than ten days, they did not see the sun again.</t126> <t127>The ground became soft and damp, like volcanic ash, and the vegetation grew increasingly insidious, and the cries of the birds and the racket of the monkeys became more and more distant, and the world became sad forever.</t127> <t128>The men of the expedition felt overwhelmed by their oldest memories in that paradise of humidity and silence, prior to original sin, where their boots sank into pits of steaming oils and their machetes shattered bloody lilies and golden salamanders.</t128> <t129>For a week, almost without speaking, they advanced like sleepwalkers through a universe of sorrow, barely illuminated by a faint glow of luminous insects and with their lungs weighed down by a suffocating smell of blood.</t129> <t130>They could not return, because the trail they were opening as they went quickly closed up again, with new vegetation that they almost saw growing before their eyes.</t130> <t131>“It doesn’t matter,” said José Arcadio Buendía.</t131> <t132>“The essential thing is not to lose our bearings.”</t132> <t133>Always attentive to the compass, he continued to guide his men towards the invisible north, until they managed to leave the enchanted region.</t133> <t134>It was a dense, starless night, but the darkness was impregnated with a new and clean air.</t134> <t135>Exhausted by the prolonged journey, they hung their hammocks and slept deeply for the first time in two weeks.</t135> <t136>When they woke up, with the sun already high, they were stunned with fascination.</t136> <t137>In front of them, surrounded by ferns and palm trees, white and dusty in the silent morning light, was an enormous Spanish galleon.</t137> <t138>Slightly tilted to starboard, the tattered remains of its sails hung from its intact rigging, among ropes adorned with orchids.</t138> <t139>The hull, covered with a smooth armor of petrified remora and tender moss, was firmly anchored in a bed of stones.</t139> <t140>The entire structure seemed to occupy its own domain, a space of solitude and oblivion, forbidden to the vices of time and the habits of birds.</t140> <t141>Inside, which the explorers examined with a silent fervor, there was nothing but a dense forest of flowers.</t141>
<t142>The discovery of the galleon, an indication of the proximity of the sea, broke the momentum of José Arcadio Buendía.</t142> <t143>He considered it a mockery of his mischievous fate to have sought the sea without finding it, at the cost of countless sacrifices and hardships, and then to have found it without seeking it, lying across his path as an insurmountable obstacle.</t143> <t144>Many years later, Colonel Aureliano Buendía crossed the region again, when it was already a regular mail route, and the only thing he found of the ship was the charred ribcage in the middle of a field of poppies.</t144> <t145>Only then, convinced that this story had not been a figment of his father's imagination, did he wonder how the galleon could have ventured so far inland.</t145> <t146>But José Arcadio Buendía did not consider that question when he found the sea, after another four days of travel, twelve kilometers away from the galleon.</t146> <t147>His dreams ended in front of that ash-colored, foamy, and dirty sea, which did not deserve the risks and sacrifices of his adventure.</t147>
<t148>—Damn it! —he shouted—.</t148> <t149>Macondo is surrounded by water on all sides.</t149>
<t150>The idea of a peninsular Macondo prevailed for a long time, inspired by the arbitrary map that José Arcadio Buendía drew upon his return from the expedition.</t150> <t151>He drew it with anger, exaggerating in bad faith the communication difficulties, as if to punish himself for the absolute senselessness with which he chose the location.</t151> <t152>“We will never get anywhere,” he lamented to Úrsula.</t152> <t153>“Here we will rot alive without receiving the benefits of science.”</t153> <t154>That certainty, ruminated over several months in the little laboratory room, led him to conceive the project of moving Macondo to a more suitable place.</t154> <t155>But this time, Úrsula anticipated his feverish designs.</t155> <t156>In a secret and relentless ant-like labor, she predisposed the women of the village against the fickleness of their men, who were already beginning to prepare for the move.</t156> <t157>José Arcadio Buendía did not know at what moment, nor by virtue of what adverse forces, his plans became entangled in a web of pretexts, setbacks, and evasions, until they turned into pure and simple illusion.</t157> <t158>Úrsula observed him with innocent attention, and even felt a bit of pity for him, the morning she found him in the little back room muttering about his moving dreams, while placing the laboratory pieces back in their original boxes.</t158> <t159>She let him finish.</t159> <t160>She let him nail the boxes shut and mark his initials on them with an inked swab, without reproaching him, but already knowing that he knew (because she heard him say it in his muffled monologues) that the men of the village would not support him in his endeavor.</t160> <t161>Only when he started to dismantle the door of the little room did Úrsula dare to ask him why he was doing it, and he answered with a certain bitterness: “Since no one wants to leave, we will go alone.”</t161> <t162>Úrsula did not get upset.</t162>
<t163>—We will not leave —he said—.</t163> <t164>We will stay here, because here we have had a child.</t164>
<t165>—We still don't have a dead person —he said—.</t165> <t166>One is not from anywhere until they have a dead person buried in the ground.</t166>
<t167>Úrsula replied, with a gentle firmness:</t167>
<t168>—If it is necessary for me to die so that you can stay here, I will die.</t168>
<t169>José Arcadio Buendía did not believe that his wife's will was so rigid.</t169> <t170>He tried to seduce her with the enchantment of his fantasy, with the promise of a prodigious world where it was enough to pour some magical liquids on the ground for the plants to bear fruit at the will of man, and where all kinds of devices for pain were sold at bargain prices.</t170> <t171>But Úrsula was insensitive to his clairvoyance.</t171>
<t172>—Instead of thinking about your crazy fantasies, you should take care of your children —he replied—.</t172> <t173>Look at them, abandoned to God's will, just like donkeys.</t173>
<t174>José Arcadio Buendía took his wife's words literally.</t174> <t175>He looked through the window and saw the two barefoot children in the sunny garden, and had the impression that only at that moment had they begun to exist, conceived by Úrsula's spell.</t175> <t176>Something then occurred within him; something mysterious and definitive that uprooted him from his current time and set him adrift in an unexplored region of memories.</t176> <t177>While Úrsula continued sweeping the house she was now sure she would never leave for the rest of her life, he remained gazing at the children with an absorbed look, until his eyes moistened and he wiped them with the back of his hand, and he exhaled a deep sigh of resignation.</t177>
<t178>—Alright —he said—.</t178> <t179>Tell them to come help me take things out of the drawers.</t179>
<t180>José Arcadio, the eldest of the children, had turned fourteen.</t180> <t181>He had a square head, bristly hair, and the willful character of his father.</t181> <t182>Although he had the same impulse for growth and physical strength, it was already evident that he lacked imagination.</t182> <t183>He was conceived and born during the arduous journey through the mountains, before the founding of Macondo, and his parents gave thanks to heaven upon realizing that he had no animal organs.</t183> <t184>Aureliano, the first human being born in Macondo, was going to turn six in March.</t184> <t185>He was silent and withdrawn.</t185> <t186>He had cried in his mother's womb and was born with his eyes open.</t186> <t187>While they cut his umbilical cord, he moved his head from side to side, recognizing the things in the room, and examined the faces of the people with a curiosity devoid of wonder.</t187> <t188>Then, indifferent to those who approached to meet him, he kept his attention focused on the palm roof, which seemed about to collapse under the tremendous pressure of the rain.</t188> <t189>Úrsula did not remember the intensity of that gaze until one day when little Aureliano, at the age of three, entered the kitchen just as she was taking a pot of boiling broth off the stove and placing it on the table.</t189> <t190>The child, perplexed at the door, said, "It's going to fall."</t190> <t191>The pot was well placed in the center of the table, but as soon as the child made the announcement, it began an irrevocable movement towards the edge, as if driven by an inner dynamism, and shattered on the floor.</t191> <t192>Alarmed, Úrsula recounted the episode to her husband, but he interpreted it as a natural phenomenon.</t192> <t193>He was always like that, oblivious to the existence of his children, partly because he considered childhood a period of mental insufficiency, and partly because he was always too absorbed in his own chimerical speculations.</t193>
<t194>But from the afternoon he called the children to help him unpack the things from the laboratory, he dedicated his best hours to them.</t194> <t195>In the small secluded room, whose walls gradually filled with implausible maps and fabulous charts, he taught them to read and write and to do arithmetic, and he spoke to them of the wonders of the world not only as far as his knowledge reached, but pushing the limits of his imagination to incredible extremes.</t195> <t196>It was thus that the children ended up learning that in the southernmost part of Africa there were men so intelligent and peaceful that their only entertainment was to sit and think, and that it was possible to cross the Aegean Sea on foot by jumping from island to island until reaching the port of Salonica.</t196> <t197>Those mesmerizing sessions were so deeply imprinted in the children's memory that many years later, a second before the officer of the regular armies gave the order to fire to the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buendía relived the warm March afternoon when his father interrupted the physics lesson, and he was left fascinated, with his hand in the air and his eyes motionless, hearing in the distance the fifes and drums and rattles of the gypsies who once again arrived in the village, proclaiming the latest and astonishing discovery of the wise men of Memphis.</t197>
<t198>They were new gypsies.</t198> <t199>Young men and women who only knew their own language, beautiful specimens with oiled skin and intelligent hands, whose dances and music sowed a panic of boisterous joy in the streets, with their parrots painted in all colors that recited Italian romances, and the hen that laid a hundred golden eggs to the sound of the tambourine, and the trained monkey that guessed thoughts, and the multiple machine that served at the same time to sew buttons and reduce fever, and the device to forget bad memories, and the plaster to waste time, and a thousand more inventions, so ingenious and unusual, that José Arcadio Buendía would have wanted to invent the memory machine to be able to remember them all.</t199> <t200>In an instant, they transformed the village.</t200> <t201>The inhabitants of Macondo suddenly found themselves lost in their own streets, bewildered by the multitudinous fair.</t201>
<t202>Holding a child in each hand to avoid losing them in the tumult, stumbling over jugglers with gold-armored teeth and six-armed acrobats, suffocated by the confusing breath of manure and sandalwood exhaled by the crowd, José Arcadio Buendía wandered like a madman searching for Melquíades everywhere, so that he could reveal the infinite secrets of that fabulous nightmare.</t202><t203>He approached several gypsies who did not understand his language.</t203><t204>Finally, he reached the place where Melquíades used to set up his tent, and found a taciturn Armenian who was announcing in Spanish a syrup to become invisible.</t204><t205>He had taken a shot of the amber substance when José Arcadio Buendía pushed his way through the absorbed group watching the spectacle and managed to ask the question.</t205><t206>The gypsy enveloped him in the astonished climate of his gaze before turning into a pool of pestilent, steaming tar over which the resonance of his response floated: "Melquíades is dead."</t206><t207>Stunned by the news, José Arcadio Buendía remained motionless, trying to overcome the grief, until the group dispersed, drawn by other artifices, and the pool of the taciturn Armenian evaporated completely.</t207><t208>Later, other gypsies confirmed that indeed Melquíades had succumbed to fevers in the dunes of Singapore, and his body had been thrown into the deepest part of the Java Sea.</t208><t209>The children were not interested in the news.</t209><t210>They were adamant that their father take them to see the marvelous novelty of the wise men of Memphis, announced at the entrance of a tent that, they said, belonged to King Solomon.</t210><t211>They insisted so much that José Arcadio Buendía paid the thirty reales and led them to the center of the tent, where there was a giant with a hairy torso and a shaved head, with a copper ring in his nose and a heavy iron chain on his ankle, guarding a pirate chest.</t211><t212>When the giant opened the chest, it released an icy breath.</t212><t213>Inside, there was only a huge transparent block, with infinite internal needles in which the twilight's clarity shattered into colored stars.</t213><t214>Bewildered, knowing that the children expected an immediate explanation, José Arcadio Buendía dared to murmur:</t214>
<t215>—It's the largest diamond in the world.</t215>
<t216>—No —corrected the gypsy—.</t216> <t217>It is ice.</t217>
<t218>José Arcadio Buendía, without understanding, extended his hand towards the ice block, but the giant pushed it away.</t218><t219>"Five more reales to touch it," he said.</t219><t220>José Arcadio Buendía paid them, and then placed his hand on the ice, keeping it there for several minutes, while his heart swelled with fear and joy at the touch of the mystery.</t220><t221>Not knowing what to say, he paid another ten reales so that his children could experience the prodigious event.</t221><t222>Little José Arcadio refused to touch it.</t222><t223>Aureliano, on the other hand, took a step forward, placed his hand on it, and withdrew it immediately.</t223><t224>"It's boiling," he exclaimed, frightened.</t224><t225>But his father paid no attention to him.</t225><t226>Intoxicated by the evidence of the wonder, at that moment he forgot the frustration of his delirious undertakings and the body of Melquíades abandoned to the appetite of the squids.</t226><t227>He paid another five reales, and with his hand on the ice block, as if testifying on a sacred text, he exclaimed:</t227>
<t228>—This is the great invention of our time.</t228>
<t229>When the pirate Francis Drake attacked Riohacha in the 16th century, Úrsula Iguarán's great-grandmother was so frightened by the alarm bells and the cannon blasts that she lost control of her nerves and sat on a lit stove.</t229> <t230>The burns left her rendered useless as a wife for the rest of her life.</t230> <t231>She could only sit sideways, propped up on cushions, and something strange must have remained in her way of walking because she never walked in public again.</t231> <t232>She gave up all kinds of social habits, obsessed with the idea that her body emitted a smell of burning.</t232> <t233>Dawn would find her in the patio, not daring to sleep, because she dreamed that the English, with their ferocious attack dogs, would come through the bedroom window and subject her to shameful tortures with red-hot irons.</t233> <t234>Her husband, an Aragonese merchant with whom she had two children, spent half his shop's earnings on medicines and entertainments, seeking a way to alleviate her terrors.</t234> <t235>Finally, he liquidated the business and took the family to live far from the sea, in a peaceful Indian settlement located at the foothills of the mountains, where he built his wife a windowless bedroom so that the pirates from her nightmares would have no way to enter.</t235>
<t236>In the hidden ranchería, a Creole tobacco grower, Don José Arcadio Buendía, had lived for a long time. He had established such a productive partnership with Úrsula's great-grandfather that they made a fortune in just a few years.</t236><t237>Several centuries later, the great-great-grandson of the Creole married the great-great-granddaughter of the Aragonese.</t237><t238>Therefore, whenever Úrsula lost her temper over her husband's craziness, she would leap over three hundred years of coincidences and curse the moment Francis Drake attacked Riohacha.</t238><t239>It was simply a way to vent, because in truth, they were bound until death by a bond stronger than love: a shared remorse of conscience.</t239><t240>They were cousins.</t240><t241>They had grown up together in the old ranchería that their ancestors had transformed with their work and good customs into one of the best towns in the province.</t241><t242>Although their marriage was predictable from the moment they were born, when they expressed their desire to marry, their own relatives tried to prevent it.</t242><t243>They feared that those healthy ends of two secularly intertwined races would face the shame of engendering iguanas.</t243><t244>There was already a terrible precedent.</t244><t245>One of Úrsula's aunts, married to one of José Arcadio Buendía's uncles, had a son who spent his entire life wearing baggy and loose trousers and who died bleeding after having lived forty-two years in the purest state of virginity, because he was born and grew up with a cartilaginous tail in the shape of a corkscrew with a brush of hair at the tip.</t245><t246>A pig's tail that no woman ever saw, and which cost him his life when a butcher friend did him the favor of cutting it off with a meat cleaver.</t246><t247>José Arcadio Buendía, with the recklessness of his nineteen years, solved the problem with a single phrase: "I don't mind having piglets, as long as they can talk."</t247><t248>So they got married with a band and fireworks party that lasted three days.</t248><t249>They would have been happy from then on if Úrsula's mother had not terrified her with all kinds of sinister predictions about her descendants, to the point of making her refuse to consummate the marriage.</t249><t250>Fearing that her burly and strong-willed husband would violate her in her sleep, Úrsula would put on a rudimentary pair of pants before going to bed, which her mother had made from sailcloth and reinforced with a system of crossed straps, fastened at the front with a thick iron buckle.</t250><t251>They stayed that way for several months.</t251><t252>During the day, he tended to his fighting cocks, and she embroidered on a frame with her mother.</t252><t253>During the night, they struggled for several hours with an anxious violence that already seemed like a substitute for the act of love, until popular intuition sniffed out that something irregular was happening and spread the rumor that Úrsula remained a virgin a year after marriage because her husband was impotent.</t253><t254>José Arcadio Buendía was the last to hear the rumor.</t254>
<t255>—You see, Úrsula, what people are saying —he said to his wife very calmly.</t255>
<t256>—Let them talk —she said—.</t256> <t257>We know it's not true.</t257>
<t258>So the situation remained the same for another six months, until the tragic Sunday when José Arcadio Buendía won a cockfight against Prudencio Aguilar.</t258> <t259>Furious, exalted by the blood of his animal, the loser stepped away from José Arcadio Buendía so that the entire cockpit could hear what he was going to say to him.</t259>
<t260>—I congratulate you —he shouted—.</t260> <t261>Let's see if finally that rooster does your wife a favor.</t261>
<t262>José Arcadio Buendía, serene, picked up his rooster.</t262> <t263>“I’ll be right back,” he said to everyone.</t263> <t264>And then, to Prudencio Aguilar:</t264>
<t265>—And you, go home and arm yourself, because I'm going to kill you.</t265>
<t266>Ten minutes later he returned with his grandfather's spear.</t266> <t267>At the door of the cockfighting pit, where half the town had gathered, Prudencio Aguilar was waiting for him.</t267> <t268>He had no time to defend himself.</t268> <t269>José Arcadio Buendía's spear, thrown with the strength of a bull and with the same precise aim with which the first Aureliano Buendía exterminated the tigers of the region, pierced his throat.</t269> <t270>That night, while the corpse was being watched over in the cockfighting pit, José Arcadio Buendía entered the bedroom as his wife was putting on her chastity pants.</t270> <t271>Brandishing the spear in front of her, he ordered: "Take that off."</t271> <t272>Úrsula did not doubt her husband's decision.</t272> <t273>"You will be responsible for what happens," she murmured.</t273> <t274>José Arcadio Buendía drove the spear into the dirt floor.</t274>
<t275>—If you are going to give birth to iguanas, we will raise iguanas —he said—.</t275> <t276>But there will be no more deaths in this town because of you.</t276>
<t277>It was a good June night, cool and moonlit, and they stayed awake and frolicking in bed until dawn, indifferent to the wind that passed through the bedroom, laden with the cries of Prudencio Aguilar's relatives.</t277>
<t278>The matter was classified as a duel of honor, but both were left with a discomfort in their conscience.</t278> <t279>One night when she couldn't sleep, Úrsula went out to get some water in the patio and saw Prudencio Aguilar next to the water jar.</t279> <t280>He was livid, with a very sad expression, trying to plug the hole in his throat with a straw stopper.</t280> <t281>It didn't scare her, but made her feel pity.</t281> <t282>She went back to the room to tell her husband what she had seen, but he didn't pay attention to her.</t282> <t283>"The dead don't come out," he said.</t283> <t284>"What happens is that we can't bear the weight of our conscience."</t284> <t285>Two nights later, Úrsula saw Prudencio Aguilar again in the bathroom, washing the crystallized blood from his neck with the straw stopper.</t285> <t286>Another night she saw him walking in the rain.</t286> <t287>José Arcadio Buendía, annoyed by his wife's hallucinations, went out to the patio armed with the spear.</t287> <t288>There was the dead man with his sad expression.</t288>
<t289>—Go to hell —José Arcadio Buendía shouted at him—.</t289> <t290>No matter how many times you come back, I will kill you again.</t290>
<t291>Prudencio Aguilar did not leave, nor did José Arcadio Buendía dare to throw the spear.</t291> <t292>Since then, he could not sleep well.</t292> <t293>He was tormented by the immense desolation with which the dead man had looked at him from the rain, the deep nostalgia with which he longed for the living, the anxiety with which he searched the house looking for water to wet his esparto plug.</t293> <t294>“He must be suffering a lot,” he said to Úrsula.</t294> <t295>“You can see that he is very lonely.”</t295> <t296>She was so moved that the next time she saw the dead man uncovering the pots on the stove, she understood what he was looking for, and from then on, she placed bowls of water all around the house.</t296> <t297>One night, when she found him washing his wounds in her own room, José Arcadio Buendía could not resist any longer.</t297>
<t298>—Alright, Prudencio —he said to him—.</t298> <t299>We will leave this town, as far as we can, and we will never return.</t299> <t300>Now go in peace.</t300>
<t301>That was how they embarked on the journey through the mountains.</t301><t302>Several friends of José Arcadio Buendía, young like him, excited by the adventure, dismantled their houses and took their wives and children to the land that no one had promised them.</t302><t303>Before leaving, José Arcadio Buendía buried the spear in the yard and slaughtered his magnificent fighting cocks one by one, believing that in this way he was giving a bit of peace to Prudencio Aguilar.</t303><t304>The only thing Úrsula took was a trunk with her newlywed clothes, a few household items, and the small chest with the gold pieces she inherited from her father.</t304><t305>They did not set a defined itinerary.</t305><t306>They only tried to travel in the opposite direction to the road to Riohacha to leave no trace and avoid encountering known people.</t306><t307>It was an absurd journey.</t307><t308>After fourteen months, with their stomachs ravaged by monkey meat and snake broth, Úrsula gave birth to a son with all his human parts.</t308><t309>She had made half the journey in a hammock hung from a pole carried on the shoulders of two men, because the swelling had disfigured her legs, and her varicose veins burst like bubbles.</t309><t310>Although it was pitiful to see them with their taut bellies and languid eyes, the children endured the journey better than their parents, and most of the time they found it fun.</t310><t311>One morning, after almost two years of traveling, they were the first mortals to see the western slope of the mountains.</t311><t312>From the cloudy summit, they gazed at the immense watery plain of the great swamp, spreading out to the other side of the world.</t312><t313>But they never found the sea.</t313><t314>One night, after several months of wandering lost through the swamps, far from the last indigenous people they had encountered on the way, they camped by the bank of a rocky river whose waters seemed like a torrent of frozen glass.</t314><t315>Years later, during the second civil war, Colonel Aureliano Buendía tried to take that same route to surprise Riohacha, and after six days of travel, he realized it was madness.</t315><t316>However, the night they camped by the river, his father's troops looked like castaways with no escape, but their number had increased during the journey, and they were all determined (and they succeeded) to die of old age.</t316><t317>That night, José Arcadio Buendía dreamed that a noisy city with houses of mirror walls rose in that place.</t317><t318>He asked what city that was, and they answered with a name he had never heard, that had no meaning, but that had a supernatural resonance in the dream: Macondo.</t318><t319>The next day he convinced his men that they would never find the sea.</t319><t320>He ordered them to cut down the trees to clear a space by the river, in the coolest spot on the bank, and there they founded the village.</t320>
<t321>José Arcadio Buendía did not manage to decipher the dream of the houses with mirror walls until the day he encountered ice.</t321> <t322>Then he believed he understood its profound meaning.</t322> <t323>He thought that in the near future, ice blocks could be manufactured on a large scale, from a material as everyday as water, and with them, build the new houses of the village.</t323> <t324>Macondo would cease to be a scorching place, where hinges and latches twisted from the heat, to become a winter city.</t324> <t325>If he did not persevere in his attempts to build an ice factory, it was because he was then positively enthusiastic about the education of his children, especially Aureliano, who had revealed from the very beginning a rare alchemical intuition.</t325> <t326>The laboratory had been dusted off.</t326> <t327>Reviewing Melquíades' notes, now calmly, without the excitement of novelty, in prolonged and patient sessions they tried to separate Úrsula's gold from the debris stuck to the bottom of the cauldron.</t327> <t328>The young José Arcadio barely participated in the process.</t328> <t329>While his father had body and soul only for the athanor, the willful firstborn, who had always been too big for his age, became a monumental adolescent.</t329> <t330>His voice changed.</t330> <t331>A faint mustache began to grow.</t331> <t332>One night Úrsula entered the room as he was undressing to sleep, and experienced a confused feeling of shame and pity: he was the first man she had seen naked, after her husband, and he was so well equipped for life, that it seemed abnormal to her.</t332> <t333>Úrsula, pregnant for the third time, relived her newlywed terrors.</t333>
<t334>At that time, a cheerful, foul-mouthed, provocative woman who helped with household chores and could read the future in cards used to come to the house.</t334> <t335>Úrsula spoke to her about her son.</t335> <t336>She thought that his disproportion was something as unnatural as the pig's tail of his cousin.</t336> <t337>The woman let out an expansive laugh that echoed through the whole house like a trail of glass.</t337> <t338>"On the contrary," she said.</t338> <t339>"He will be happy."</t339> <t340>To confirm her prediction, she brought the cards to the house a few days later and locked herself up with José Arcadio in a grain storage room adjacent to the kitchen.</t340> <t341>She calmly placed the cards on an old carpenter's bench, talking about anything, while the boy waited near her more bored than intrigued.</t341> <t342>Suddenly, she extended her hand and touched him.</t342> <t343>"How amazing," she said, sincerely frightened, and that was all she could say.</t343> <t344>José Arcadio felt his bones fill with foam, a languid fear, and a terrible desire to cry.</t344> <t345>The woman did not make any insinuation.</t345> <t346>But José Arcadio kept searching for her all night in the smoky smell she had in her armpits, which had stayed under his skin.</t346> <t347>He wanted to be with her at all times, wanted her to be his mother, never to leave the granary, and to tell him how amazing, and to touch him again and say how amazing.</t347> <t348>One day he couldn't take it anymore and went to look for her at her house.</t348> <t349>He made a formal, incomprehensible visit, sitting in the living room without saying a word.</t349> <t350>At that moment, he did not desire her.</t350> <t351>He found her different, entirely alien to the image inspired by her smell, as if she were someone else.</t351> <t352>He drank the coffee and left the house depressed.</t352> <t353>That night, in the terror of wakefulness, he desired her again with brutal anxiety, but then he didn't want her as she had been in the granary, but as she had been that afternoon.</t353>
<t354>Days later, in an unexpected manner, the woman called him to her house, where she was alone with her mother, and made him enter the bedroom under the pretext of showing him a card trick.</t354><t355>Then she touched him with such freedom that he felt a disappointment after the initial shiver, and experienced more fear than pleasure.</t355><t356>She asked him to come for her that night.</t356><t357>He agreed, just to get it over with, knowing he wouldn't be able to go.</t357><t358>But that night, in the burning bed, he realized that he had to go for her even if he wasn't capable.</t358><t359>He dressed in the dark, hearing in the darkness the calm breathing of his brother, the dry cough of his father in the next room, the asthma of the chickens in the yard, the buzz of the mosquitoes, the thumping of his heart, and the overwhelming noise of the world that he hadn't noticed until then, and went out into the sleeping street.</t359><t360>He wholeheartedly wished that the door would be barred, and not just ajar, as she had promised him.</t360><t361>But it was open.</t361><t362>He pushed it with the tip of his fingers and the hinges let out a mournful and articulated creak that had an icy resonance in his guts.</t362><t363>From the moment he entered, sideways and trying not to make noise, he smelled the odor.</t363><t364>He was still in the small living room where the woman's three brothers hung their hammocks in positions he didn't know and couldn't determine in the darkness, so he had to cross it by feel, push the bedroom door, and orient himself there in such a way that he wouldn't mistake the bed.</t364><t365>He managed it.</t365><t366>He stumbled over the hammock ropes, which were lower than he had supposed, and a man who had been snoring until then stirred in his sleep and said with a kind of disappointment: "It was Wednesday."</t366><t367>When he pushed the bedroom door, he couldn't prevent it from scraping the uneven floor.</t367><t368>Suddenly, in the absolute darkness, he realized with an irremediable nostalgia that he was completely disoriented.</t368><t369>In the narrow room slept the mother, another daughter with her husband and two children, and the woman who perhaps wasn't expecting him.</t369><t370>He could have guided himself by the smell if the smell hadn't been all over the house, so deceptive and at the same time so defined as it had always been on her skin.</t370><t371>He remained motionless for a long time, wondering in astonishment how he had managed to reach that abyss of helplessness, when a hand with all fingers extended, groping in the darkness, touched his face.</t371><t372>He wasn't surprised, because without knowing it he had been expecting it.</t372><t373>Then he entrusted himself to that hand, and in a terrible state of exhaustion let himself be led to a shapeless place where they took off his clothes and shook him like a sack of potatoes and turned him inside out and upside down, in an unfathomable darkness where his arms were superfluous, where it no longer smelled of woman but of ammonia, and where he tried to remember her face and found himself with Ursula's face, confusedly aware that he was doing something he had long wished could be done, but had never imagined could actually be done, without knowing how he was doing it because he didn't know where the feet and the head were, nor whose feet nor whose head, and feeling that he couldn't resist any longer the glacial murmur of his kidneys and the air in his guts, and the fear, and the bewildered urge to flee and at the same time to stay forever in that exasperated silence and that dreadful solitude.</t373>
<t374>Her name was Pilar Ternera.</t374> <t375>She had been part of the exodus that culminated in the founding of Macondo, dragged by her family to separate her from the man who raped her at fourteen and continued to love her until she was twenty-two, but who never decided to make the situation public because he was an outsider.</t375> <t376>He promised to follow her to the ends of the earth, but later, when he sorted out his affairs, and she had grown tired of waiting for him, always identifying him with the tall and short men, blond and dark, that the cards promised her along the roads of the land and the paths of the sea, for within three days, three months, or three years.</t376> <t377>She had lost in the wait the strength of her thighs, the firmness of her breasts, the habit of tenderness, but she kept intact the madness of her heart.</t377> <t378>Distraught by that prodigious toy, José Arcadio searched for her trace every night through the labyrinth of the room.</t378> <t379>On one occasion he found the door barred, and he knocked several times, knowing that if he had had the courage to knock the first time, he had to knock until the last, and after an interminable wait, she opened the door for him.</t379> <t380>During the day, collapsing from sleep, he secretly enjoyed the memories of the previous night.</t380> <t381>But when she entered the house, cheerful, indifferent, talkative, he did not have to make any effort to hide his tension, because that woman whose explosive laughter scared the pigeons had nothing to do with the invisible power that taught him to breathe inward and control the beats of his heart, and had allowed him to understand why men are afraid of death.</t381> <t382>He was so absorbed that he didn't even understand everyone's joy when his father and brother stirred up the house with the news that they had managed to break through the metallic crust and separate Úrsula's gold.</t382>
<t383>Indeed, after complicated and persevering days, they had achieved it.</t383> <t384>Úrsula was happy, and even gave thanks to God for the invention of alchemy, while the villagers crowded into the laboratory, and they were served guava sweets with cookies to celebrate the miracle, and José Arcadio Buendía let them see the crucible with the rescued gold, as if he had just invented it.</t384> <t385>From showing it so much, he ended up in front of his eldest son, who had barely been in the laboratory lately.</t385> <t386>He put the dry and yellowish lump in front of his eyes and asked him, "What do you think?"</t386> <t387>José Arcadio, sincerely, replied:</t387>
<t388>—Dog shit.</t388>
<t389>His father struck him violently in the mouth with the back of his hand, causing blood and tears to burst forth.</t389> <t390>That night, Pilar Ternera applied arnica compresses to the swelling, guessing the bottle and the cotton in the darkness, and did everything he wanted without him getting upset, to love him without hurting him.</t390> <t391>They achieved such a state of intimacy that a moment later, without realizing it, they were speaking in whispers.</t391>
<t392>—I want to be alone with you —he said—.</t392> <t393>One of these days, I'll tell everyone everything, and the hiding will end.</t393>
<t394>She did not try to appease him.</t394>
<t395>—It would be very good —he said—.</t395> <t396>If we are alone, we leave the lamp on to see each other well, and I can scream all I want without anyone having to interfere and you can whisper all the dirty things you can think of in my ear.</t396>
<t397>This conversation, the biting resentment he felt against his father, and the imminent possibility of unbridled love inspired him with a serene courage.</t397> <t398>In a spontaneous manner, without any preparation, he told everything to his brother.</t398>
<t399>At the beginning, little Aureliano only understood the risk, the immense possibility of danger that his brother's adventures entailed, but he couldn't grasp the fascination of the objective.</t399> <t400>Gradually, he became contaminated with anxiety.</t400> <t401>He would have the meticulous adventures recounted to him, he identified with his brother's suffering and joy, he felt scared and happy.</t401> <t402>He waited for him awake until dawn, in the solitary bed that seemed to have a mat of embers, and they continued talking without sleep until it was time to get up, so that very soon both suffered the same drowsiness, felt the same disdain for their father's alchemy and wisdom, and took refuge in solitude.</t402> <t403>“These children are walking around like zombies,” Úrsula said.</t403> <t404>“They must have worms.”</t404> <t405>She prepared a repugnant potion of crushed paico, which both drank with unexpected stoicism, and they sat on their potties at the same time eleven times in a single day, and expelled some pink parasites that they showed to everyone with great jubilation, because they allowed them to mislead Úrsula about the origin of their distractions and languidness.</t405> <t406>Aureliano could not only understand then, but he could live his brother's experiences as his own, because on one occasion when his brother was explaining the mechanism of love in great detail, he interrupted him to ask: “What does it feel like?”</t406> <t407>José Arcadio gave him an immediate answer:</t407>
<t408>—It's like an earthquake.</t408>
<t409>One Thursday in January, at two in the morning, Amaranta was born.</t409> <t410>Before anyone entered the room, Úrsula examined her meticulously.</t410> <t411>She was light and watery like a lizard, but all her parts were human.</t411> <t412>Aureliano did not notice the novelty until he felt the house full of people.</t412> <t413>Protected by the confusion, he went out in search of his brother, who had not been in bed since eleven, and it was such an impulsive decision that he didn't even have time to wonder how he would get him out of Pilar Ternera's bedroom.</t413> <t414>He wandered around the house for several hours, whistling private signals, until the proximity of dawn forced him to return.</t414> <t415>In his mother's room, playing with the newborn sister and with a face that exuded innocence, he found José Arcadio.</t415>
<t416>Úrsula had barely completed her forty-day rest when the gypsies returned.</t416> <t417>They were the same acrobats and jugglers who had brought the ice.</t417> <t418>Unlike Melquíades' tribe, they had quickly shown that they were not heralds of progress, but peddlers of entertainment.</t418> <t419>Even when they brought the ice, they did not announce it based on its usefulness in human life, but as a mere circus curiosity.</t419> <t420>This time, among many other tricks, they brought a flying carpet.</t420> <t421>But they did not offer it as a fundamental contribution to the development of transportation, but as a recreational object.</t421> <t422>The people, of course, unearthed their last bits of gold to enjoy a fleeting flight over the village houses.</t422> <t423>Taking advantage of the delightful impunity of collective disorder, José Arcadio and Pilar experienced hours of relief.</t423> <t424>They were two happy lovers among the crowd, and they even began to suspect that love could be a more serene and profound feeling than the wild but momentary happiness of their secret nights.</t424> <t425>Pilar, however, broke the spell.</t425> <t426>Encouraged by the enthusiasm with which José Arcadio enjoyed her company, she mistook the form and the occasion, and in one fell swoop, she threw the world upon him.</t426> <t427>“Now you are a man,” she said to him.</t427> <t428>And since he did not understand what she wanted to tell him, she explained it to him letter by letter:</t428>
<t429>—You are going to have a child.</t429>
<t430>José Arcadio did not dare to leave his house for several days.</t430> <t431>It was enough for him to hear Pilar's boisterous laughter in the kitchen to run and take refuge in the laboratory, where the alchemy artifacts had come back to life with Úrsula's blessing.</t431> <t432>José Arcadio Buendía welcomed the lost son with joy and initiated him into the search for the philosopher's stone, which he had finally undertaken.</t432> <t433>One afternoon, the boys got excited about the flying carpet that swiftly passed by the laboratory window, carrying the gypsy driver and several village children who were cheerfully waving, and José Arcadio Buendía didn't even look at it.</t433> <t434>"Let them dream," he said.</t434> <t435>"We will fly better than they do with more scientific resources than that miserable bedspread."</t435> <t436>Despite his feigned interest, José Arcadio never understood the powers of the philosophical egg, which simply seemed to him like a poorly made flask.</t436> <t437>He couldn't escape his worry.</t437> <t438>He lost his appetite and sleep, succumbed to bad temper, just like his father when one of his ventures failed, and his distress was so great that José Arcadio Buendía himself relieved him of his duties in the laboratory, believing he had taken alchemy too seriously.</t438> <t439>Aureliano, of course, understood that his brother's distress did not originate from the search for the philosopher's stone, but he couldn't get him to confide in him.</t439> <t440>He had lost his former spontaneity.</t440> <t441>From being a communicative accomplice, he became secretive and hostile.</t441> <t442>Anxious for solitude, bitten by a virulent resentment against the world, one night he left his bed as usual, but instead of going to Pilar Ternera's house, he mingled with the tumult of the fair.</t442> <t443>After wandering among all sorts of contraptions without being interested in any, he focused on something that wasn't part of the show: a very young gypsy girl, almost a child, laden with trinkets, the most beautiful woman José Arcadio had ever seen in his life.</t443> <t444>She was among the crowd watching the sad spectacle of the man who turned into a snake for disobeying his parents.</t444>
<t445>José Arcadio paid no attention.</t445> <t446>While the sad interrogation of the snake-man was taking place, he had made his way through the crowd to the front row where the gypsy girl was, and had stopped behind her.</t446> <t447>He pressed against her back.</t447> <t448>The girl tried to move away, but José Arcadio pressed harder against her back.</t448> <t449>Then she felt it.</t449> <t450>She remained motionless against him, trembling with surprise and fear, unable to believe the evidence, and finally turned her head and looked at him with a trembling smile.</t450> <t451>At that moment, two gypsies put the snake-man into his cage and took him inside the tent.</t451> <t452>The gypsy who was directing the show announced:</t452>
<t453>—And now, ladies and gentlemen, we are going to show the terrible ordeal of the woman who will have to be decapitated every night at this hour for one hundred and fifty years, as punishment for having seen what she should not have.</t453>
<t454>José Arcadio and the girl did not witness the decapitation.</t454> <t455>They went to her tent, where they kissed with desperate anxiety while they took off their clothes.</t455> <t456>The gypsy girl got rid of her overlapping bodices, her numerous starched lace petticoats, her useless wired corset, her load of trinkets, and was practically reduced to nothing.</t456> <t457>She was a languid little frog, with budding breasts and legs so thin that they did not surpass José Arcadio's arms in diameter, but she had a determination and warmth that compensated for her fragility.</t457> <t458>However, José Arcadio could not respond to her because they were in a sort of public tent, where the gypsies passed by with their circus things and took care of their affairs, and even lingered by the bed to play a game of dice.</t458> <t459>The lamp hanging from the central pole illuminated the entire space.</t459> <t460>In a pause of the caresses, José Arcadio stretched out naked on the bed, not knowing what to do, while the girl tried to encourage him.</t460> <t461>A gypsy woman of splendid flesh entered shortly after, accompanied by a man who was not part of the troupe, but who was also not from the village, and they both began to undress in front of the bed.</t461> <t462>Unintentionally, the woman looked at José Arcadio and examined with a kind of pathetic fervor his magnificent animal at rest.</t462>
<t463>—Boy —he exclaimed—, may God preserve it for you.</t463>
<t464>José Arcadio's companion asked them to leave them alone, and the couple lay down on the floor, very close to the bed.</t464> <t465>The passion of the others awakened José Arcadio's fever.</t465> <t466>At the first contact, the girl's bones seemed to disarticulate with a disordered crackle like that of a domino file, and her skin dissolved into a pale sweat and her eyes filled with tears and her whole body exhaled a mournful lament and a vague smell of mud.</t466> <t467>But she endured the impact with admirable firmness of character and bravery.</t467> <t468>José Arcadio then felt lifted into a state of seraphic inspiration, where his heart unraveled into a spring of tender obscenities that entered the girl through her ears and came out of her mouth translated into her language.</t468> <t469>It was Thursday.</t469> <t470>On Saturday night, José Arcadio tied a red cloth around his head and left with the gypsies.</t470>
<t471>When Úrsula discovered his absence, she looked for him all over the village.</t471> <t472>In the dismantled camp of the gypsies, there was nothing but a trail of waste among the still-smoldering ashes of the extinguished fires.</t472> <t473>Someone who was rummaging through the trash for trinkets told Úrsula that the night before, they had seen her son in the tumult of the carnival, pushing a wheelbarrow with the cage of the snake-man.</t473> <t474>“He joined the gypsies!” she shouted to her husband, who had shown no sign of alarm at the disappearance.</t474>
<t475>—I wish it were true —said José Arcadio Buendía, pounding in the mortar the substance that had been pounded a thousand times, reheated, and pounded again—.</t475> <t476>That way he will learn to be a man.</t476>
<t477>Úrsula asked where the gypsies had gone.</t477> <t478>She continued asking along the path they indicated, and believing she still had time to catch up with them, she kept moving away from the village until she realized she was so far away that she no longer thought of returning.</t478> <t479>José Arcadio Buendía did not notice his wife's absence until eight o'clock at night, when he left the substance reheating in a bed of manure and went to see what was wrong with little Amaranta, who was hoarse from crying.</t479> <t480>In a few hours, he gathered a group of well-equipped men, placed Amaranta in the care of a woman who offered to nurse her, and disappeared down invisible paths in search of Úrsula.</t480> <t481>Aureliano accompanied them.</t481> <t482>Some indigenous fishermen, whose language they did not understand, indicated by signs at dawn that they had not seen anyone pass by.</t482> <t483>After three days of futile searching, they returned to the village.</t483>
<t484>For several weeks, José Arcadio Buendía succumbed to consternation.</t484> <t485>He took care of little Amaranta like a mother.</t485> <t486>He bathed her and changed her clothes, took her to be nursed four times a day, and even sang to her at night the songs that Úrsula never knew how to sing.</t486> <t487>On one occasion, Pilar Ternera offered to do the household chores while Úrsula returned.</t487> <t488>Aureliano, whose mysterious intuition had become sensitized in misfortune, experienced a flash of clairvoyance upon seeing her enter.</t488> <t489>Then he knew that in some inexplicable way she was to blame for his brother's flight and his mother's subsequent disappearance, and he harassed her so much, with a silent and implacable hostility, that the woman never returned to the house.</t489>
<t490>Time put things in their place.</t490> <t491>José Arcadio Buendía and his son did not know at what moment they were back in the laboratory, shaking off the dust, lighting the fire in the athanor, once again dedicated to the patient manipulation of the matter that had been dormant for several months in its bed of manure.</t491> <t492>Even Amaranta, lying in a wicker basket, observed with curiosity the absorbing work of her father and brother in the little room made rarefied by mercury vapors.</t492> <t493>On one occasion, months after Úrsula's departure, strange things began to happen.</t493> <t494>An empty jar that had been forgotten in a cupboard for a long time became so heavy that it was impossible to move.</t494> <t495>A pot of water placed on the work table boiled without fire for half an hour until it completely evaporated.</t495> <t496>José Arcadio Buendía and his son observed those phenomena with frightened joy, unable to explain them, but interpreting them as signs from the matter.</t496> <t497>One day, Amaranta's basket began to move on its own and made a complete turn in the room, to the consternation of Aureliano, who hurried to stop it.</t497> <t498>But his father was not disturbed.</t498> <t499>He put the basket back in its place and tied it to the leg of a table, convinced that the awaited event was imminent.</t499> <t500>It was on that occasion that Aureliano heard him say:</t500>
<t501>—If you do not fear God, fear the metals.</t501>
<t502>Suddenly, almost five months after her disappearance, Úrsula returned.</t502> <t503>She arrived excited, rejuvenated, with new clothes of a style unknown in the village.</t503> <t504>José Arcadio Buendía could barely withstand the impact.</t504> <t505>“This was it!” he shouted.</t505> <t506>“I knew it was going to happen.”</t506> <t507>And he truly believed it, because in his prolonged seclusions, while manipulating matter, he prayed deep in his heart that the awaited miracle would not be the discovery of the philosopher's stone, nor the liberation of the breath that gives life to metals, nor the ability to turn the house's hinges and locks into gold, but what had now occurred: Úrsula's return.</t507> <t508>But she did not share his joy.</t508> <t509>She gave him a conventional kiss, as if she had not been absent for more than an hour, and said to him:</t509>
<t510>—Take a look at the door.</t510>
<t511>José Arcadio Buendía took a long time to recover from his bewilderment when he went out into the street and saw the crowd.</t511> <t512>They were not gypsies.</t512> <t513>They were men and women like them, with straight hair and brown skin, who spoke the same language and lamented the same pains.</t513> <t514>They brought mules loaded with food, ox carts with furniture and household utensils, pure and simple earthly accessories put up for sale without fuss by the peddlers of everyday reality.</t514> <t515>They came from the other side of the swamp, only two days' journey away, where there were towns that received mail every month and knew the machines of well-being.</t515> <t516>Úrsula had not caught up with the gypsies, but she found the route that her husband could not discover in his frustrated search for great inventions.</t516>
<t517>Pilar Ternera's son was taken to his grandparents' house two weeks after he was born.</t517><t518>Úrsula reluctantly admitted him, once again defeated by her husband's stubbornness, who could not tolerate the idea of a child of his blood being left adrift, but she imposed the condition that the child's true identity be kept secret.</t518><t519>Although he was given the name José Arcadio, they ended up calling him simply Arcadio to avoid confusion.</t519><t520>At that time, there was so much activity in the town and so much hustle and bustle in the house that the care of the children was relegated to a secondary level.</t520><t521>They were entrusted to Visitación, a Guajira Indian who came to the town with a brother, fleeing from a plague of insomnia that had been afflicting their tribe for several years.</t521><t522>Both were so docile and helpful that Úrsula took charge of them to help her with household chores.</t522><t523>Thus, Arcadio and Amaranta spoke the Guajira language before Spanish, and learned to drink lizard broth and eat spider eggs without Úrsula noticing, because she was too busy with a promising business of candy animals.</t523><t524>Macondo was transformed.</t524><t525>The people who arrived with Úrsula spread the word about the good quality of its soil and its privileged position with respect to the swamp, so that the once sparse village soon became an active town, with shops and craft workshops, and a permanent trade route through which the first Arabs arrived, wearing slippers and earrings, trading glass necklaces for macaws.</t525><t526>José Arcadio Buendía did not have a moment's rest.</t526><t527>Fascinated by an immediate reality that then seemed more fantastic than the vast universe of his imagination, he lost all interest in the alchemy laboratory, let the matter exhausted by long months of manipulation rest, and returned to being the enterprising man of the early days who decided the layout of the streets and the position of the new houses, so that no one enjoyed privileges that everyone did not have.</t527><t528>He acquired so much authority among the newcomers that no foundations were laid nor fences erected without consulting him, and it was determined that he should be the one to direct the distribution of the land.</t528><t529>When the gypsy acrobats returned, now with their traveling fair transformed into a gigantic establishment of games of chance, they were received with joy because it was thought that José Arcadio was returning with them.</t529><t530>But José Arcadio did not return, nor did they bring the snake-man who Úrsula thought was the only one who could give them news of her son, so the gypsies were not allowed to settle in the town or return in the future, as they were considered messengers of lust and perversion.</t530><t531>José Arcadio Buendía, however, was explicit in stating that Melquíades' old tribe, which had contributed so much to the village's growth with their ancient wisdom and fabulous inventions, would always find the doors open.</t531><t532>But Melquíades' tribe, according to the wanderers, had been wiped off the face of the earth for having surpassed the limits of human knowledge.</t532>
<t533>Emancipated at least for the moment from the tortures of fantasy, José Arcadio Buendía quickly imposed a state of order and work, within which he allowed only one indulgence: the release of the birds that had cheered the time with their flutes since the founding, and the installation in their place of musical clocks in all the houses.</t533> <t534>They were precious carved wooden clocks that the Arabs exchanged for macaws, and which José Arcadio Buendía synchronized with such precision that every half hour the town was cheered by the progressive chords of the same piece, culminating in an exact and unanimous midday with the complete waltz.</t534> <t535>It was also José Arcadio Buendía who decided in those years that almond trees should be planted in the town's streets instead of acacias, and who discovered, without ever revealing them, the methods to make them eternal.</t535> <t536>Many years later, when Macondo was a camp of wooden houses with zinc roofs, the broken and dusty almond trees still endured in the oldest streets, although no one then knew who had planted them.</t536> <t537>While his father was putting the town in order and his mother was consolidating the domestic patrimony with her marvelous industry of sugar roosters and fish that twice a day left the house strung on balsa wood sticks, Aureliano spent endless hours in the abandoned laboratory, learning the art of silversmithing through pure investigation.</t537> <t538>He had grown so much that in a short time the clothes abandoned by his brother no longer fit him, and he began to wear his father's, but it was necessary for Visitación to sew tucks into the shirts and gussets into the pants because Aureliano had not inherited the corpulence of the others.</t538> <t539>Adolescence had taken away the sweetness of his voice and made him silent and definitively solitary, but in return, it had restored the intense expression he had in his eyes at birth.</t539> <t540>He was so concentrated on his silversmithing experiments that he barely left the laboratory to eat.</t540> <t541>Concerned about his self-absorption, José Arcadio Buendía gave him keys to the house and a little money, thinking that perhaps he needed a woman.</t541> <t542>But Aureliano spent the money on muriatic acid to prepare aqua regia and embellished the keys with a gold plating.</t542> <t543>His exaggerations were only comparable to those of Arcadio and Amaranta, who had already started to lose their teeth and still clung all day to the Indian blankets, stubborn in their decision not to speak Spanish but the Guajiro language.</t543> <t544>"You have nothing to complain about," Úrsula told her husband.</t544> <t545>"Children inherit the madness of their parents."</t545> <t546>And while she lamented her bad luck, convinced that her children's extravagances were something as dreadful as a pig's tail, Aureliano fixed on her a gaze that enveloped her in an aura of uncertainty.</t546>
<t547>—Someone is going to come —he told her.</t547>
<t548>Úrsula, as always when he expressed a prediction, tried to discourage him with her homespun logic.</t548> <t549>It was normal for someone to arrive.</t549> <t550>Dozens of strangers passed through Macondo daily without arousing concerns or foretelling secret announcements.</t550> <t551>However, beyond all logic, Aureliano was certain of his premonition.</t551>
<t552>—I don't know who it will be —he insisted—, but whoever it is, they are already on their way.</t552>
<t553>On Sunday, indeed, Rebeca arrived.</t553> <t554>She was no more than eleven years old.</t554> <t555>She had made the arduous journey from Manaure with some fur traders who were tasked with delivering her along with a letter to the house of José Arcadio Buendía, but they could not precisely explain who had asked them to do the favor.</t555> <t556>All her luggage consisted of a small trunk of clothes, a small wooden rocking chair with hand-painted colorful flowers, and a canvas sack that made a constant cloc cloc cloc noise, in which she carried her parents' bones.</t556> <t557>The letter addressed to José Arcadio Buendía was written in very affectionate terms by someone who still loved him very much despite the time and distance and who felt compelled by a basic sense of humanity to do the charity of sending him this poor helpless orphan girl, who was Úrsula's second cousin and therefore also a relative of José Arcadio Buendía, although more distantly, because she was the daughter of that unforgettable friend Nicanor Ulloa and his very dignified wife Rebeca Montiel, whom God had in His holy kingdom, whose remains were enclosed with the letter so they could be given a Christian burial.</t557> <t558>Both the mentioned names and the signature of the letter were perfectly legible, but neither José Arcadio Buendía nor Úrsula remembered having relatives with those names nor did they know anyone named like the sender, much less in the remote town of Manaure.</t558> <t559>It was impossible to obtain any additional information through the girl.</t559> <t560>From the moment she arrived, she sat sucking her thumb in the rocking chair and observing everyone with her large frightened eyes, without giving any sign of understanding what she was being asked.</t560> <t561>She wore a black-dyed diagonal dress, worn from use, and some chipped patent leather boots.</t561> <t562>Her hair was held behind her ears with black ribbon bows.</t562> <t563>She wore a scapular with images faded by sweat and on her right wrist a carnivorous animal's fang mounted on a copper support as a charm against the evil eye.</t563> <t564>Her green skin, her round and tense belly like a drum, revealed poor health and a hunger older than herself, but when they gave her food, she kept the plate on her lap without tasting it.</t564> <t565>It was even believed that she was deaf-mute, until the Indians asked her in their language if she wanted some water, and she moved her eyes as if she recognized them and nodded yes with her head.</t565>
<t566>They stayed with her because there was no other choice.</t566><t567>They decided to call her Rebeca, which according to the letter was her mother's name, because Aureliano had the patience to read the entire list of saints' names to her and she did not react to any of them.</t567><t568>Since at that time there was no cemetery in Macondo, as no one had died until then, they kept the sack with the bones waiting for a worthy place to bury them, and for a long time they were in the way everywhere and were found where least expected, always with their clucking like a brooding hen.</t568><t569>A long time passed before Rebeca joined the family life.</t569><t570>She would sit in the little rocking chair sucking her thumb in the most secluded corner of the house.</t570><t571>Nothing caught her attention except the music of the clocks, which she searched for with frightened eyes every half hour, as if expecting to find it somewhere in the air.</t571><t572>They couldn't get her to eat for several days.</t572><t573>Nobody understood how she hadn't died of hunger, until the indigenous people, who noticed everything because they roamed the house incessantly with their stealthy feet, discovered that Rebeca only liked to eat the damp earth from the patio and the lime cakes she scraped off the walls with her nails.</t573><t574>It was evident that her parents, or whoever had raised her, had scolded her for this habit, as she practiced it secretly and with a sense of guilt, trying to hide the portions to eat them when no one was watching.</t574><t575>From then on, they subjected her to relentless surveillance.</t575><t576>They sprinkled cow bile in the patio and smeared hot pepper on the walls, believing they could defeat her pernicious habit with these methods, but she showed such signs of cunning and ingenuity to procure the earth that Úrsula was forced to employ more drastic measures.</t576><t577>She would put orange juice with rhubarb in a pot and leave it out overnight, giving her the potion the next morning on an empty stomach.</t577><t578>Although no one had told her that this was the specific remedy for the habit of eating earth, she thought that any bitter substance on an empty stomach had to make the liver react.</t578><t579>Rebeca was so rebellious and strong despite her rickets that they had to hold her down like a calf to make her swallow the medicine, and they could barely restrain her tantrums and endure the convoluted hieroglyphics she alternated with bites and spit, which according to the scandalized indigenous people were the grossest obscenities conceivable in their language.</t579><t580>When Úrsula found out, she complemented the treatment with lashings.</t580><t581>It was never established whether it was the rhubarb or the beatings, or both combined, that took effect, but the truth is that within a few weeks Rebeca began to show signs of recovery.</t581><t582>She participated in the games of Arcadio and Amaranta, who welcomed her as an older sister, and ate with appetite using the cutlery properly.</t582><t583>It soon became apparent that she spoke Spanish as fluently as the indigenous language, that she had a remarkable skill for manual crafts, and that she sang the waltz of the clocks with a very funny lyric she had invented herself.</t583><t584>They soon considered her as another member of the family.</t584><t585>She was more affectionate with Úrsula than her own children ever were, and she called Amaranta and Arcadio little siblings, Aureliano uncle, and José Arcadio Buendía grandpa.</t585><t586>Thus, she ended up deserving as much as the others the name of Rebeca Buendía, the only one she ever had and carried with dignity until her death.</t586>
<t587>One night, around the time when Rebeca was cured of the habit of eating dirt and was taken to sleep in the room with the other children, the Indian woman who slept with them woke up by chance and heard a strange intermittent noise in the corner.</t587> <t588>Alarmed, she sat up, believing that an animal had entered the room, and then saw Rebeca in the rocking chair, sucking her thumb and with eyes glowing like those of a cat in the dark.</t588> <t589>Stunned with terror, troubled by the fatality of her destiny, Visitación recognized in those eyes the symptoms of the disease whose threat had forced her and her brother to exile themselves forever from a millennial kingdom in which they were princes.</t589> <t590>It was the plague of insomnia.</t590>
<t591>Cataure, the Indian, did not wake up in the house.</t591> <t592>His sister stayed, because her fatalistic heart indicated to her that the lethal ailment would pursue her no matter what to the last corner of the earth.</t592> <t593>Nobody in the house understood Visitación's alarm.</t593> <t594>"If we don't go back to sleep, even better," said José Arcadio Buendía, in good spirits.</t594> <t595>"That way life will be more productive for us."</t595> <t596>But the Indian woman explained to them that the most fearsome aspect of the insomnia disease was not the inability to sleep, since the body did not feel any fatigue, but its inexorable progression towards a more critical manifestation: forgetfulness.</t596> <t597>She meant that when the patient got used to their state of wakefulness, childhood memories began to fade from their memory, then the name and notion of things, and finally the identity of people and even the awareness of one's own self, until sinking into a kind of idiocy without a past.</t597> <t598>José Arcadio Buendía, laughing heartily, considered it to be one of the many ailments invented by the superstition of the indigenous people.</t598> <t599>But Úrsula, just in case, took the precaution of separating Rebeca from the other children.</t599>
<t600>After several weeks, when Visitación's terror seemed to have subsided, José Arcadio Buendía found himself one night tossing and turning in bed, unable to sleep.</t600> <t601>Úrsula, who had also awakened, asked him what was wrong, and he replied: "I'm thinking about Prudencio Aguilar again."</t601> <t602>They didn't sleep a minute, but the next day they felt so rested that they forgot about the bad night.</t602> <t603>Aureliano commented in amazement at lunchtime that he felt very well despite having spent the whole night in the laboratory gilding a brooch he planned to give Úrsula on her birthday.</t603> <t604>They didn't become alarmed until the third day, when at bedtime they felt wide awake and realized they had been awake for more than fifty hours.</t604>
<t605>—The children are also awake —said the indigenous woman with her fatalistic conviction—.</t605> <t606>Once it enters the house, no one escapes the plague.</t606>
<t607>They had indeed contracted the disease of insomnia.</t607> <t608>Úrsula, who had learned from her mother the medicinal value of plants, prepared and made everyone drink a concoction of aconite, but they did not manage to sleep; instead, they spent the whole day dreaming awake.</t608> <t609>In that state of hallucinatory lucidity, they not only saw the images of their own dreams, but also those dreamed by others.</t609> <t610>It was as if the house had been filled with visitors.</t610> <t611>Sitting in her rocking chair in a corner of the kitchen, Rebeca dreamed that a man very much like her, dressed in white linen and with the collar of his shirt closed by a gold button, brought her a bouquet of roses.</t611> <t612>He was accompanied by a woman with delicate hands who took a rose and placed it in the girl's hair.</t612> <t613>Úrsula understood that the man and woman were Rebeca's parents, but although she made a great effort to recognize them, she confirmed her certainty that she had never seen them before.</t613> <t614>Meanwhile, due to a carelessness that José Arcadio Buendía never forgave himself for, the little candy animals made in the house continued to be sold in the town.</t614> <t615>Children and adults delightedly sucked on the delicious green roosters of insomnia, the exquisite pink fish of insomnia, and the tender yellow horses of insomnia, so that the dawn of Monday found the whole town awake.</t615> <t616>At first, no one was alarmed.</t616> <t617>On the contrary, they were glad not to sleep, because there was so much to do in Macondo that time was barely enough.</t617> <t618>They worked so much that soon they had nothing left to do, and they found themselves at three in the morning with their arms crossed, counting the number of notes in the waltz of the clocks.</t618> <t619>Those who wanted to sleep, not out of tiredness but out of nostalgia for dreams, resorted to all kinds of exhausting methods.</t619> <t620>They gathered to talk without pause, to repeat the same jokes for hours and hours, to complicate the story of the capon rooster to the limits of exasperation, which was an infinite game where the narrator would ask if they wanted him to tell the story of the capon rooster, and when they answered yes, the narrator would say he hadn't asked them to say yes, but if they wanted him to tell the story of the capon rooster, and when they answered no, the narrator would say he hadn't asked them to say no, but if they wanted him to tell the story of the capon rooster, and when they stayed silent, the narrator would say he hadn't asked them to stay silent, but if they wanted him to tell the story of the capon rooster, and no one could leave, because the narrator would say he hadn't asked them to leave, but if they wanted him to tell the story of the capon rooster, and so on, in a vicious circle that lasted entire nights.</t620>
<t621>When José Arcadio Buendía realized that the plague had invaded the town, he gathered the heads of families to explain what he knew about the insomnia disease, and measures were agreed upon to prevent the scourge from spreading to other populations in the swamp.</t621> <t622>Thus, the bells were removed from the goats that the Arabs traded for macaws, and they were placed at the entrance of the town for those who ignored the advice and pleas of the sentinels and insisted on visiting the population.</t622> <t623>All the outsiders who roamed the streets of Macondo at that time had to ring their bell so that the sick would know they were healthy.</t623> <t624>They were not allowed to eat or drink anything during their stay, as there was no doubt that the disease was only transmitted through the mouth, and all food and drink were contaminated with insomnia.</t624> <t625>In this way, the plague was kept confined to the perimeter of the population.</t625> <t626>The quarantine was so effective that the day came when the emergency situation was considered natural, and life was organized in such a way that work regained its rhythm and no one worried anymore about the useless habit of sleeping.</t626>
<t627>It was Aureliano who conceived the formula that would defend them for several months from the evasions of memory.</t627> <t628>He discovered it by chance.</t628> <t629>An expert insomniac, having been one of the first, he had learned the art of silversmithing to perfection.</t629> <t630>One day he was looking for the small anvil he used to laminate metals, and he couldn't remember its name.</t630> <t631>His father told him: "tas."</t631> <t632>Aureliano wrote the name on a piece of paper and glued it to the base of the little anvil: tas.</t632> <t633>That way he was sure he wouldn't forget it in the future.</t633> <t634>It didn't occur to him that this was the first manifestation of forgetfulness, because the object had a name that was difficult to remember.</t634> <t635>But a few days later he discovered that he had difficulty remembering almost everything in the laboratory.</t635> <t636>So he labeled them with their respective names, so that it was enough to read the inscription to identify them.</t636> <t637>When his father expressed his alarm at having forgotten even the most impressive events of his childhood, Aureliano explained his method to him, and José Arcadio Buendía put it into practice throughout the house and later imposed it on the entire town.</t637> <t638>With an inked swab, he marked each thing with its name: table, chair, clock, door, wall, bed, pot.</t638> <t639>He went to the corral and labeled the animals and plants: cow, goat, pig, hen, yucca, taro, banana.</t639> <t640>Little by little, studying the infinite possibilities of forgetfulness, he realized that a day might come when things would be recognized by their inscriptions, but their utility would not be remembered.</t640> <t641>Then he became more explicit.</t641> <t642>The sign he hung around the cow's neck was an exemplary display of how the inhabitants of Macondo were willing to fight against forgetfulness: This is the cow, it must be milked every morning so that it produces milk and the milk must be boiled to mix it with coffee and make coffee with milk.</t642> <t643>Thus they continued living in a slippery reality, momentarily captured by words, but which would inevitably escape when they forgot the values of the written letter.</t643>
<t644>At the entrance of the swamp road, a sign had been put up that said Macondo and another larger one on the main street that said God exists.</t644> <t645>In all the houses, keys had been written to memorize objects and feelings.</t645> <t646>But the system required so much vigilance and moral strength that many succumbed to the spell of an imaginary reality, invented by themselves, which was less practical but more comforting.</t646> <t647>Pilar Ternera was the one who contributed the most to popularizing this mystification, when she conceived the artifice of reading the past in the cards as she had previously read the future.</t647> <t648>Through this resource, the insomniacs began to live in a world constructed by the uncertain alternatives of the cards, where the father was barely remembered as the dark-skinned man who had arrived at the beginning of April and the mother was barely remembered as the olive-skinned woman who wore a gold ring on her left hand, and where a birth date was reduced to the last Tuesday when the lark sang in the laurel tree.</t648> <t649>Defeated by those practices of consolation, José Arcadio Buendía then decided to build the memory machine that he had once desired to remember the marvelous inventions of the gypsies.</t649> <t650>The device was based on the possibility of reviewing every morning, from beginning to end, the entirety of the knowledge acquired in life.</t650> <t651>He imagined it as a rotating dictionary that an individual situated at the axis could operate by means of a crank, so that in a few hours the most necessary notions for living would pass before their eyes.</t651> <t652>He had managed to write about fourteen thousand cards when an eccentric old man appeared on the swamp road with the sad bell of the sleepers, carrying a bulging suitcase tied with ropes and a cart covered with black cloths.</t652> <t653>He went directly to the house of José Arcadio Buendía.</t653>
<t654>Visitación did not recognize him when she opened the door, and she thought he intended to sell something, unaware that nothing could be sold in a town that was hopelessly sinking into the quagmire of oblivion.</t654> <t655>He was a decrepit man.</t655> <t656>Although his voice was also cracked with uncertainty and his hands seemed to doubt the existence of things, it was evident that he came from a world where men could still sleep and remember.</t656> <t657>José Arcadio Buendía found him sitting in the living room, fanning himself with a patched black hat, while he read the signs pasted on the walls with compassionate attention.</t657> <t658>He greeted him with wide displays of affection, fearing he had known him in another time and now could not remember.</t658> <t659>But the visitor noticed his falseness.</t659> <t660>He felt forgotten, not with the remediable forgetfulness of the heart, but with another more cruel and irrevocable forgetfulness that he knew very well, because it was the forgetfulness of death.</t660> <t661>Then he understood.</t661> <t662>He opened the suitcase crammed with indecipherable objects, and from among them he took out a briefcase with many bottles.</t662> <t663>He gave José Arcadio Buendía a drink of a calm-colored substance, and light dawned in his memory.</t663> <t664>Tears moistened his eyes, before he saw himself in an absurd room where the objects were labeled, and before he was ashamed of the solemn nonsense written on the walls, and even before he recognized the newcomer in a dazzling flash of joy.</t664> <t665>It was Melquíades.</t665>
<t666>While Macondo celebrated the reconquest of memories, José Arcadio Buendía and Melquíades dusted off their old friendship.</t666><t667>The gypsy was determined to stay in the town.</t667><t668>He had indeed been in death, but he had returned because he could not bear the loneliness.</t668><t669>Repudiated by his tribe, deprived of all supernatural faculties as punishment for his fidelity to life, he decided to take refuge in that corner of the world not yet discovered by death, dedicated to the operation of a daguerreotype laboratory.</t669><t670>José Arcadio Buendía had never heard of that invention.</t670><t671>But when he saw himself and his entire family captured in an eternal age on an iridescent metal plate, he was left speechless with astonishment.</t671><t672>From that time dated the rusted daguerreotype in which José Arcadio Buendía appeared with bristly and ashen hair, the stiff collar of his shirt fastened with a copper button, and an expression of astonished solemnity, which Úrsula described, laughing to death, as "a frightened general."</t672><t673>In truth, José Arcadio Buendía was frightened on that clear December morning when they took the daguerreotype, because he thought that people would gradually wear out as their image passed onto the metal plates.</t673><t674>By a curious inversion of custom, it was Úrsula who got that idea out of his head, as it was also she who forgot her old resentments and decided that Melquíades should stay living in the house, although she never allowed them to take a daguerreotype of her because (in her own exact words) she did not want to be a laughingstock for her grandchildren.</t674><t675>That morning, she dressed the children in their best clothes, powdered their faces, and gave each of them a spoonful of marrow syrup so they could remain absolutely still for almost two minutes in front of Melquíades' cumbersome camera.</t675><t676>In the family daguerreotype, the only one that ever existed, Aureliano appeared dressed in black velvet, between Amaranta and Rebeca.</t676><t677>He had the same languor and the same clairvoyant look that he would have years later in front of the firing squad, but he had not yet felt the premonition of his destiny.</t677><t678>He was an expert goldsmith, esteemed throughout the swamp for the meticulousness of his work.</t678><t679>In the workshop he shared with Melquíades' chaotic laboratory, he was barely heard breathing.</t679><t680>He seemed to be sheltered in another time, while his father and the gypsy loudly interpreted Nostradamus' predictions, amid a clatter of bottles and tubs, and the disaster of spilled acids and lost silver bromide due to the constant jostling and stumbling.</t680><t681>That dedication to work, the good judgment with which he managed his interests, had allowed Aureliano to earn more money in a short time than Úrsula with her delightful candy animals, but everyone was surprised that he was already a grown man and had not been known to have a woman.</t681><t682>In reality, he had never had one.</t682>
<t683>Months later, Francisco the Man returned, an elderly wanderer of almost 200 years who frequently passed through Macondo, spreading the songs he composed himself.</t683> <t684>In them, Francisco the Man recounted with meticulous details the news that occurred in the towns along his route, from Manaure to the edges of the swamp, so that if someone had a message to send or an event to publicize, they paid him two cents to include it in his repertoire.</t684> <t685>This was how Úrsula learned of her mother's death, purely by chance, one night when she was listening to the songs hoping they would say something about her son José Arcadio.</t685> <t686>Francisco the Man, so called because he defeated the devil in a duel of improvised songs, and whose real name no one knew, disappeared from Macondo during the insomnia plague and one night reappeared without any announcement in Catarino's store.</t686> <t687>The whole town went to listen to him to find out what had happened in the world.</t687> <t688>On this occasion, he arrived with a woman so fat that four Indians had to carry her in a rocker, and a teenage mulatto girl with a helpless appearance who protected her from the sun with an umbrella.</t688> <t689>Aureliano went to Catarino's store that night.</t689> <t690>He found Francisco the Man, like a monolithic chameleon, sitting in the middle of a circle of curious onlookers.</t690> <t691>He sang the news with his old, hoarse voice, accompanying himself with the same archaic accordion that Sir Walter Raleigh had given him in Guiana, while he kept the rhythm with his large, salt-cracked walking feet.</t691> <t692>In front of a back door through which some men were entering and leaving, the matron of the rocker was sitting and fanning herself in silence.</t692> <t693>Catarino, with a felt rose in his ear, was selling bowls of fermented guarapo to the crowd, and took the opportunity to approach the men and put his hand where he shouldn't.</t693> <t694>By midnight, the heat was unbearable.</t694> <t695>Aureliano listened to the news until the end without finding any that interested his family.</t695> <t696>He was about to return home when the matron signaled to him with her hand.</t696>
<t697>—You come in too —he said to him—.</t697> <t698>It only costs twenty cents.</t698>
<t699>Aureliano tossed a coin into the piggy bank that the matron had on her lap and entered the room without knowing why.</t699><t700>The teenage mulatto girl, with her little dog-like breasts, was naked on the bed.</t700><t701>Before Aureliano, that night, sixty-three men had passed through the room.</t701><t702>From so much use, and kneaded in sweat and sighs, the air in the room was beginning to turn into mud.</t702><t703>The girl removed the soaked sheet and asked Aureliano to hold it on one side.</t703><t704>It was as heavy as a canvas.</t704><t705>They wrung it out, twisting it by the ends, until it regained its natural weight.</t705><t706>They turned the mat over, and the sweat came out the other side.</t706><t707>Aureliano longed for that operation to never end.</t707><t708>He knew the theoretical mechanics of love, but he couldn't stand up due to the discouragement in his knees, and although his skin was bristling and burning, he couldn't resist the urge to expel the weight from his guts.</t708><t709>When the girl finished fixing the bed and ordered him to undress, he gave her a flustered explanation: "They made me come in.</t709><t710>They told me to toss twenty cents into the piggy bank and not to take too long."</t710><t711>The girl understood his confusion.</t711><t712>"If you toss another twenty cents on your way out, you can take a little longer," she said softly.</t712><t713>Aureliano undressed, tormented by shame, unable to shake the idea that his nakedness couldn't compare to his brother's.</t713><t714>Despite the girl's efforts, he felt increasingly indifferent and terribly alone.</t714><t715>"I'll toss another twenty cents," he said in a desolate voice.</t715><t716>The girl thanked him in silence.</t716><t717>Her back was raw.</t717><t718>Her skin clung to her ribs and her breathing was altered by an unfathomable exhaustion.</t718><t719>Two years earlier, far from there, she had fallen asleep without extinguishing the candle and had woken up surrounded by fire.</t719><t720>The house where she lived with the grandmother who had raised her was reduced to ashes.</t720><t721>Since then, her grandmother had taken her from town to town, laying her down for twenty cents, to pay for the value of the burned house.</t721><t722>According to the girl's calculations, she still had about ten years of seventy men per night left, because she also had to pay for the travel and food expenses for both of them and the wages of the Indians who carried the rocker.</t722><t723>When the matron knocked on the door for the second time, Aureliano left the room without having done anything, dazed by the desire to cry.</t723><t724>That night he couldn't sleep thinking about the girl, with a mixture of desire and pity.</t724><t725>He felt an irresistible need to love and protect her.</t725><t726>At dawn, exhausted by insomnia and fever, he made the serene decision to marry her to free her from the grandmother's despotism and enjoy every night the satisfaction she gave to seventy men.</t726><t727>But at ten in the morning, when he arrived at Catarino's store, the girl had left town.</t727>
<t728>The passage of time calmed his reckless purpose, but aggravated his sense of frustration.</t728> <t729>He took refuge in work.</t729> <t730>He resigned himself to being a man without a woman for his entire life to hide the shame of his uselessness.</t730> <t731>Meanwhile, Melquíades finished capturing everything that could be captured in Macondo on his plates, and abandoned the daguerreotype laboratory to the delusions of José Arcadio Buendía, who had resolved to use it to obtain scientific proof of the existence of God.</t731> <t732>Through a complicated process of superimposed exposures taken in different parts of the house, he was sure he would sooner or later make a daguerreotype of God, if He existed, or put an end once and for all to the supposition of His existence.</t732> <t733>Melquíades delved into the interpretations of Nostradamus.</t733> <t734>He stayed up very late, suffocating in his faded velvet vest, scribbling papers with his tiny sparrow-like hands, whose rings had lost the luster of another era.</t734> <t735>One night he thought he found a prediction about the future of Macondo.</t735> <t736>It would be a luminous city, with large glass houses, where no trace of the Buendía lineage remained.</t736> <t737>“It’s a mistake,” thundered José Arcadio Buendía.</t737> <t738>“They won’t be glass houses but ice houses, as I dreamed, and there will always be a Buendía, for centuries and centuries.”</t738> <t739>In that extravagant house, Úrsula struggled to preserve common sense, having expanded the candy animal business with an oven that produced baskets and baskets of bread all night and a prodigious variety of puddings, meringues, and sponge cakes, which vanished in a few hours through the swamp’s pathways.</t739> <t740>She had reached an age where she had the right to rest, but was, however, increasingly active.</t740> <t741>She was so busy with her prosperous enterprises that one afternoon she looked distractedly towards the patio while the Indian woman helped her sweeten the dough, and saw two unknown and beautiful adolescents embroidering in a hoop by the twilight light.</t741> <t742>They were Rebeca and Amaranta.</t742> <t743>They had just taken off their grandmother’s mourning clothes, which they had kept with inflexible rigor for three years, and the colored clothes seemed to have given them a new place in the world.</t743> <t744>Rebeca, contrary to what might have been expected, was the most beautiful.</t744> <t745>She had a clear complexion, large and calm eyes, and magical hands that seemed to weave the embroidery’s pattern with invisible threads.</t745> <t746>Amaranta, the younger one, was a bit graceless, but she had the natural distinction, the inner poise of the dead grandmother.</t746> <t747>Next to them, although already revealing his father’s physical drive, Arcadio seemed like a child.</t747> <t748>He had dedicated himself to learning the art of silversmithing with Aureliano, who had also taught him to read and write.</t748> <t749>Úrsula suddenly realized that the house was filled with people, that her children were about to marry and have children, and that they would be forced to disperse due to lack of space.</t749> <t750>Then she took out the money accumulated over long years of hard work, made commitments with her clients, and undertook the expansion of the house.</t750> <t751>She arranged for the construction of a formal living room for visitors, another more comfortable and cool for daily use, a dining room for a table with twelve places where the family could sit with all their guests; nine bedrooms with windows facing the patio and a long corridor protected from the midday glare by a rose garden, with a handrail for placing fern pots and begonia planters.</t751> <t752>She arranged to expand the kitchen to build two ovens, to destroy the old barn where Pilar Ternera had read José Arcadio’s future, and to build another twice as large so that food would never be lacking in the house.</t752> <t753>She arranged to build in the patio, under the shade of the chestnut tree, a bathroom for women and another for men, and at the back a large stable, a wired chicken coop, a milking stable, and an aviary open to the four winds so that the aimless birds could settle as they pleased.</t753> <t754>Followed by dozens of masons and carpenters, as if she had contracted her husband’s hallucinatory fever, Úrsula ordered the positioning of the light and the conduct of the heat, and distributed the space without the slightest sense of its limits.</t754> <t755>The primitive construction of the founders was filled with tools and materials, with workers overwhelmed by sweat, who asked everyone to please not get in the way, without realizing that it was they who were in the way, exasperated by the bag of human bones that followed them everywhere with its dull rattling.</t755> <t756>In that discomfort, breathing quicklime and tar molasses, no one quite understood how from the bowels of the earth emerged not only the largest house that would ever be in the town, but the most hospitable and cool that there ever was in the swamp’s domain.</t756> <t757>José Arcadio Buendía, trying to surprise Divine Providence in the midst of the cataclysm, was the one who understood it the least.</t757> <t758>The new house was almost finished when Úrsula pulled him out of his chimerical world to inform him that there was an order to paint the facade blue, not white as they wanted.</t758> <t759>She showed him the official order written on a piece of paper.</t759> <t760>José Arcadio Buendía, without understanding what his wife was saying, deciphered the signature.</t760>
<t761>—Who is this guy? —he asked.</t761>
<t762>—The magistrate —said Úrsula disconsolately—.</t762> <t763>They say he is an authority sent by the government.</t763>
<t764>Don Apolinar Moscote, the magistrate, had arrived in Macondo without making any noise.</t764> <t765>He got off at Jacob's Hotel —established by one of the first Arabs who arrived bartering trinkets for macaws— and the next day he rented a small room with a door to the street, two blocks from the Buendía house.</t765> <t766>He set up a table and a chair that he bought from Jacob, nailed a republic shield he had brought with him to the wall, and painted the sign on the door: Magistrate.</t766> <t767>His first order was to have all the houses painted blue to celebrate the anniversary of national independence.</t767> <t768>José Arcadio Buendía, with a copy of the order in hand, found him taking a nap in a hammock he had hung in the sparse office.</t768> <t769>“Did you write this paper?” he asked him.</t769> <t770>Don Apolinar Moscote, a mature, timid man of sanguine complexion, answered yes.</t770> <t771>“With what right?” José Arcadio Buendía asked again.</t771> <t772>Don Apolinar Moscote searched for a paper in the desk drawer and showed it to him: “I have been appointed magistrate of this town.”</t772> <t773>José Arcadio Buendía didn't even look at the appointment.</t773>
<t774>—In this town, we don't rule with papers —he said without losing his calm—.</t774> <t775>And just so you know once and for all, we don't need any magistrate because there's nothing to correct here.</t775>
<t776>In the face of Don Apolinar Moscote's impassiveness, always without raising his voice, he gave a detailed account of how they had founded the village, how they had divided the land, opened the roads, and introduced the improvements that necessity had demanded, without bothering any government and without anyone bothering them.</t776> <t777>"We are so peaceful that we haven't even died of natural causes," he said.</t777> <t778>"You see, we still don't have a cemetery."</t778> <t779>He did not complain that the government had not helped them.</t779> <t780>On the contrary, he was glad that until then it had let them grow in peace, and he hoped it would continue to do so, because they had not founded a town for the first newcomer to come and tell them what they should do.</t780> <t781>Don Apolinar Moscote had put on a drill jacket, as white as his pants, without losing the purity of his gestures at any moment.</t781>
<t782>—So if you want to stay here, like any other ordinary citizen, you are very welcome —concluded José Arcadio Buendía—.</t782> <t783>But if you come to create disorder by forcing people to paint their houses blue, you can pack your things and leave the way you came.</t783> <t784>Because my house must be white like a dove.</t784>
<t785>Don Apolinar Moscote turned pale.</t785> <t786>He took a step back and clenched his jaws to say with a certain distress:</t786>
<t787>—I want to warn you that I am armed.</t787>
<t788>José Arcadio Buendía did not know at what moment the youthful strength with which he could knock down a horse came into his hands.</t788> <t789>He grabbed Don Apolinar Moscote by the lapel and lifted him to the height of his eyes.</t789>
<t790>—I do this —he told him— because I prefer to carry him alive and not have to keep carrying him dead for the rest of my life.</t790>
<t791>He carried him down the middle of the street, suspended by his lapels, until he set him on his two feet on the path to the swamp.</t791> <t792>A week later, he was back with six barefoot and ragged soldiers, armed with shotguns, and an ox cart in which his wife and seven daughters traveled.</t792> <t793>Later, two more carts arrived with the furniture, trunks, and household utensils.</t793> <t794>He installed the family in the Hotel de Jacob while he found a house, and reopened the office protected by the soldiers.</t794> <t795>The founders of Macondo, determined to expel the invaders, went with their eldest sons to offer their services to José Arcadio Buendía.</t795> <t796>But he opposed it, as he explained, because Don Apolinar Moscote had returned with his wife and daughters, and it was not a man's thing to humiliate others in front of their family.</t796> <t797>So he decided to resolve the situation amicably.</t797>
<t798>Aureliano accompanied him.</t798> <t799>By then, he had already started to grow a black mustache with waxed tips, and he had the slightly stentorian voice that would characterize him in the war.</t799> <t800>Unarmed, ignoring the guard, they entered the corregidor's office.</t800> <t801>Don Apolinar Moscote did not lose his composure.</t801> <t802>He introduced them to two of his daughters who happened to be there by chance: Amparo, sixteen years old, dark-skinned like her mother, and Remedios, barely nine years old, a beautiful girl with lily-white skin and green eyes.</t802> <t803>They were graceful and well-mannered.</t803> <t804>As soon as they entered, before being introduced, the girls brought them chairs to sit down.</t804> <t805>But both remained standing.</t805>
<t806>—Very well, my friend —said José Arcadio Buendía—, you will stay here, but not because you have those blunderbuss bandits at the door, rather out of consideration for your wife and daughters.</t806>
<t807>Don Apolinar Moscote was taken aback, but José Arcadio Buendía did not give him time to reply.</t807> <t808>“We only have two conditions,” he added.</t808> <t809>“The first: that everyone paints their house whatever color they want.</t809> <t810>The second: that the soldiers leave immediately.</t810> <t811>We guarantee the order.”</t811> <t812>The magistrate raised his right hand with all his fingers extended.</t812>
<t813>—Word of honor?</t813>
<t814>—Word of an enemy —said José Arcadio Buendía.</t814> <t815>And he added in a bitter tone—:</t815> <t816>Because there's one thing I want to tell you: you and I are still enemies.</t816>
<t817>That same afternoon the soldiers left.</t817> <t818>A few days later, José Arcadio Buendía found a house for the corregidor's family.</t818> <t819>Everyone was at peace, except Aureliano.</t819> <t820>The image of Remedios, the corregidor's youngest daughter, who could have been his own daughter due to her age, remained aching somewhere in his body.</t820> <t821>It was a physical sensation that almost bothered him when walking, like a small stone in his shoe.</t821>
<t822>The new house, white as a dove, was inaugurated with a dance.</t822> <t823>Úrsula had conceived that idea since the afternoon she saw Rebeca and Amaranta turned into teenagers, and it can almost be said that the main reason for the construction was the desire to provide the girls with a worthy place to receive visitors.</t823> <t824>So that nothing would diminish the splendor of that purpose, she worked like a galley slave while the renovations were being carried out, so that before they were finished, she had ordered costly items for decoration and service, and the wonderful invention that was to arouse the town's astonishment and the youth's joy: the player piano.</t824> <t825>They brought it in pieces, packed in several crates that were unloaded along with the Viennese furniture, Bohemian glassware, China Company dishes, Dutch tablecloths, and a rich variety of lamps and candlesticks, and vases, hangings, and tapestries.</t825> <t826>The importing house sent at their own expense an Italian expert, Pietro Crespi, to assemble and tune the player piano, instruct the buyers in its operation, and teach them to dance to the fashionable music printed on six rolls of paper.</t826>
<t827>Pietro Crespi was young and blond, the most handsome and well-mannered man that had been seen in Macondo, so meticulous in his dress that despite the suffocating heat he worked in a brocaded vest and a thick dark cloth coat.</t827><t828>Soaked in sweat, keeping a reverent distance from the owners of the house, he spent several weeks locked in the living room, with a dedication similar to Aureliano's in his goldsmith workshop.</t828><t829>One morning, without opening the door, without summoning any witness to the miracle, he placed the first roll in the pianola, and the tormenting hammering and the constant clatter of the wooden slats ceased in a silence of astonishment, before the order and cleanliness of the music.</t829><t830>Everyone rushed to the living room.</t830><t831>José Arcadio Buendía seemed struck not by the beauty of the melody, but by the autonomous keystrokes of the pianola, and he installed Melquíades' camera in the living room with the hope of obtaining a daguerreotype of the invisible performer.</t831><t832>That day the Italian had lunch with them.</t832><t833>Rebeca and Amaranta, serving the table, were intimidated by the fluidity with which that angelic man with pale hands and no rings handled the cutlery.</t833><t834>In the sitting room, adjacent to the living room, Pietro Crespi taught them to dance.</t834><t835>He indicated the steps without touching them, marking the rhythm with a metronome, under the kind supervision of Úrsula, who did not leave the room for a single moment while her daughters received the lessons.</t835><t836>Pietro Crespi wore special pants in those days, very flexible and tight, and dance slippers.</t836><t837>"You don't have to worry so much," José Arcadio Buendía told his wife.</t837><t838>"This man is a sissy."</t838><t839>But she did not give up her vigilance until the learning was over and the Italian left Macondo.</t839><t840>Then the organization of the party began.</t840><t841>Úrsula made a strict list of the guests, in which the only ones chosen were the descendants of the founders, except for Pilar Ternera's family, who had already had two other children by unknown fathers.</t841><t842>It was actually a class selection, only determined by feelings of friendship, as the favored ones were not only the oldest close friends of José Arcadio Buendía's house since before undertaking the exodus that culminated in the founding of Macondo, but their children and grandchildren were the usual companions of Aureliano and Arcadio since childhood, and their daughters were the only ones who visited the house to embroider with Rebeca and Amaranta.</t842><t843>Don Apolinar Moscote, the benevolent ruler whose actions were reduced to supporting two policemen armed with wooden clubs with his meager resources, was an ornamental authority.</t843><t844>To cope with household expenses, his daughters opened a sewing workshop, where they made felt flowers, guava snacks, and love notes on request.</t844><t845>But despite being modest and helpful, the most beautiful in town and the most skilled in the new dances, they could not get themselves considered for the party.</t845>
<t846>While Úrsula and the girls unpacked furniture, polished the dishes, and hung pictures of maidens in boats laden with roses, breathing new life into the bare spaces built by the masons, José Arcadio Buendía gave up the pursuit of the image of God, convinced of its nonexistence, and disassembled the player piano to decipher its secret magic.</t846> <t847>Two days before the party, bogged down in a mess of leftover pegs and hammers, fumbling among a tangle of strings that he unwound from one end only to have them wind up again at the other, he managed to roughly reassemble the instrument.</t847> <t848>There were never as many shocks and scurrying about as in those days, but the new tar lamps were lit on the scheduled date and time.</t848> <t849>The house opened, still smelling of resins and damp lime, and the children and grandchildren of the founders discovered the corridor of ferns and begonias, the silent rooms, the garden saturated with the fragrance of roses, and gathered in the visiting room in front of the unknown invention that had been covered with a white sheet.</t849> <t850>Those who knew the pianoforte, popular in other swamp towns, felt a bit disheartened, but Úrsula's disappointment was even more bitter when she placed the first roll for Amaranta and Rebeca to start the dance, and the mechanism didn't work.</t850> <t851>Melquíades, nearly blind and crumbling with decrepitude, resorted to the arts of his ancient wisdom to try to fix it.</t851> <t852>At last, José Arcadio Buendía accidentally moved a stuck device, and the music came out first in spurts, and then in a stream of convoluted notes.</t852> <t853>Striking against the strings placed without rhyme or reason and tuned with recklessness, the hammers went haywire.</t853> <t854>But the stubborn descendants of the twenty-one intrepid men who had explored the mountains seeking the sea to the west, eluded the pitfalls of the melodic mishmash, and the dance lasted until dawn.</t854>
<t855>Pietro Crespi went back to fixing the pianola.</t855> <t856>Rebeca and Amaranta helped him arrange the strings and joined in his laughter at the complexity of the waltzes.</t856> <t857>He was extremely affectionate, and so honest by nature that Úrsula gave up her vigilance.</t857> <t858>The night before his trip, a dance was improvised with the restored pianola to bid him farewell, and he gave a virtuosic demonstration of modern dances with Rebeca.</t858> <t859>Arcadio and Amaranta matched them in grace and skill.</t859> <t860>But the exhibition was interrupted because Pilar Ternera, who was at the door with the curious onlookers, got into a biting and hair-pulling fight with a woman who dared to comment that young Arcadio had a woman's buttocks.</t860> <t861>Around midnight, Pietro Crespi said goodbye with a sentimental little speech and promised to return very soon.</t861> <t862>Rebeca accompanied him to the door, and after closing the house and turning off the lamps, she went to her room to cry.</t862> <t863>It was an inconsolable cry that lasted for several days, and whose cause not even Amaranta knew.</t863> <t864>Her secrecy was not strange.</t864> <t865>Although she seemed expansive and cordial, she had a solitary character and an impenetrable heart.</t865> <t866>She was a splendid teenager, with long and firm bones, but she insisted on continuing to use the little wooden rocking chair she had arrived with, often reinforced and now devoid of arms.</t866> <t867>No one had discovered that even at that age she still had the habit of sucking her thumb.</t867> <t868>That's why she never missed a chance to lock herself in the bathroom, and she had acquired the habit of sleeping with her face turned against the wall.</t868> <t869>On rainy afternoons, while embroidering with a group of friends in the begonia corridor, she would lose the thread of the conversation and a tear of nostalgia would salt her palate when she saw the streaks of damp earth and the mounds of mud built by the worms in the garden.</t869> <t870>Those secret tastes, once defeated by oranges with rhubarb, burst into an irrepressible longing when she began to cry.</t870> <t871>She went back to eating dirt.</t871> <t872>The first time she did it almost out of curiosity, sure that the bad taste would be the best remedy against the temptation.</t872> <t873>And indeed, she couldn't stand the dirt in her mouth.</t873> <t874>But she persisted, overcome by the growing urge, and little by little she recovered the ancestral appetite, the taste for primary minerals, the unblemished satisfaction of the original food.</t874> <t875>She would stuff handfuls of dirt into her pockets and eat it grain by grain without being seen, with a confused feeling of joy and rage, while she trained her friends in the most difficult stitches and talked about other men who did not deserve the sacrifice of eating the lime off the walls for them.</t875> <t876>The handfuls of dirt made the only man who deserved such degradation less remote and more certain, as if the ground he walked on with his fine patent leather boots in another part of the world transmitted to her the weight and temperature of his blood in a mineral taste that left a rough ember in her mouth and a sediment of peace in her heart.</t876> <t877>One afternoon, without any reason, Amparo Moscote asked for permission to see the house.</t877> <t878>Amaranta and Rebeca, bewildered by the unexpected visit, attended to her with a hard formality.</t878> <t879>They showed her the renovated mansion, played the pianola rolls for her, and offered her orangeade with cookies.</t879> <t880>Amparo gave a lesson in dignity, personal charm, and good manners, which impressed Úrsula in the brief moments she attended the visit.</t880> <t881>After two hours, when the conversation began to languish, Amparo took advantage of a momentary distraction by Amaranta and handed a letter to Rebeca.</t881> <t882>She managed to see the name of the very distinguished Miss Rebeca Buendía, written in the same methodical handwriting, the same green ink, and the same precious arrangement of words as the instructions for operating the pianola, and she folded the letter with her fingertips and hid it in her bodice, looking at Amparo Moscote with an expression of endless and unconditional gratitude and a silent promise of complicity until death.</t882>
<t883>The sudden friendship between Amparo Moscote and Rebeca Buendía raised Aureliano's hopes.</t883> <t884>The memory of little Remedios had not stopped tormenting him, but he couldn't find the opportunity to see her.</t884> <t885>When he walked around the town with his closest friends, Magnífico Visbal and Gerineldo Márquez —sons of the founders with the same names—, he searched for her with anxious eyes in the sewing workshop and only saw the older sisters.</t885> <t886>The presence of Amparo Moscote in the house was like a premonition.</t886> <t887>"She has to come with her," Aureliano said to himself in a low voice.</t887> <t888>"She has to come."</t888> <t889>He repeated it so many times, and with such conviction, that one afternoon while he was assembling a little gold fish in the workshop, he was certain that she had responded to his call.</t889> <t890>Shortly after, indeed, he heard the little child's voice, and when he looked up with his heart frozen in fear, he saw the girl at the door in a pink organdy dress and white boots.</t890>
<t891>—Don't go in there, Remedios —said Amparo Moscote in the hallway—.</t891> <t892>They are working.</t892>
<t893>But Aureliano did not give him time to respond.</t893> <t894>He lifted the little golden fish hanging from a chain that came out of its mouth, and said to him:</t894>
<t895>—Come in.</t895>
<t896>Remedios approached and asked some questions about the little fish, which Aureliano could not answer because a sudden asthma attack prevented him.</t896> <t897>He wanted to stay forever next to that lily-like skin, next to those emerald eyes, very close to that voice that with each question called him sir with the same respect with which she addressed his father.</t897> <t898>Melquíades was in the corner, sitting at the desk, scribbling indecipherable signs.</t898> <t899>Aureliano hated him.</t899> <t900>He could do nothing except tell Remedios that he was going to give her the little fish, and the girl was so frightened by the offer that she hurriedly left the workshop.</t900> <t901>That afternoon, Aureliano lost the hidden patience with which he had waited for the chance to see her.</t901> <t902>He neglected his work.</t902> <t903>He called her many times, in desperate efforts of concentration, but Remedios did not respond.</t903> <t904>He looked for her in her sisters' workshop, in the curtains of her house, in her father's office, but he only found her in the image that saturated his own terrible solitude.</t904> <t905>He spent entire hours with Rebeca in the visiting room listening to the waltzes of the pianola.</t905> <t906>She listened to them because it was the music with which Pietro Crespi had taught her to dance.</t906> <t907>Aureliano listened to them simply because everything, even the music, reminded him of Remedios.</t907>
<t908>The house was filled with love.</t908><t909>Aureliano expressed it in verses that had neither beginning nor end.</t909><t910>He wrote them on the rough parchments that Melquíades gave him, on the bathroom walls, on the skin of his arms, and in all of them Remedios appeared transfigured: Remedios in the soporific air of two in the afternoon, Remedios in the silent breath of the roses, Remedios in the secret clepsydra of the moths, Remedios in the steam of the bread at dawn, Remedios everywhere and Remedios forever.</t910><t911>Rebeca waited for love at four in the afternoon, embroidering by the window.</t911><t912>She knew that the mail mule only arrived every fifteen days, but she always waited for it, convinced that it would arrive any day by mistake.</t912><t913>The opposite happened: once the mule did not arrive on the scheduled date.</t913><t914>Mad with desperation, Rebeca got up at midnight and ate handfuls of earth in the garden, with suicidal avidity, crying in pain and fury, chewing tender worms and splintering her molars with snail shells.</t914><t915>She vomited until dawn.</t915><t916>She sank into a state of feverish prostration, lost consciousness, and her heart opened in a shameless delirium.</t916><t917>Úrsula, scandalized, forced the lock of the trunk, and found at the bottom, tied with pink ribbons, the sixteen perfumed letters and the skeletons of leaves and petals preserved in old books and the dried butterflies that turned to dust when touched.</t917>
<t918>Aureliano was the only one capable of understanding such desolation.</t918> <t919>That afternoon, while Úrsula was trying to rescue Rebeca from the mangrove of delirium, he went with Magnífico Visbal and Gerineldo Márquez to Catarino's store.</t919> <t920>The establishment had been expanded with a gallery of wooden rooms where women who smelled of dead flowers lived alone.</t920> <t921>An ensemble of accordion and drums played the songs of Francisco the Man, who had disappeared from Macondo several years ago.</t921> <t922>The three friends drank fermented guarapo.</t922> <t923>Magnífico and Gerineldo, contemporaries of Aureliano but more experienced in worldly matters, drank methodically with women sitting on their laps.</t923> <t924>One of them, withered and with gold-capped teeth, gave Aureliano a shuddering caress.</t924> <t925>He rejected her.</t925> <t926>He had discovered that the more he drank, the more he remembered Remedios, but he could better endure the torture of her memory.</t926> <t927>He didn't know at what moment he began to float.</t927> <t928>He saw his friends and the women navigating in a radiant reverberation, without weight or volume, saying words that didn't come from their lips and making mysterious signals that didn't correspond to their gestures.</t928> <t929>Catarino put a hand on his back and said, "It's going to be eleven."</t929> <t930>Aureliano turned his head, saw the enormous disfigured face with a felt flower in the ear, and then he lost his memory, as in the times of oblivion, and regained it in a foreign dawn and in a room that was completely unfamiliar to him, where Pilar Ternera was in a slip, barefoot, disheveled, lighting him with a lamp and stunned with disbelief.</t930>
<t931>—Aureliano!</t931>
<t932>Aureliano stood firm on his feet and raised his head.</t932> <t933>He did not know how he had arrived there, but he knew the purpose, because he had carried it hidden since childhood in an inviolable corner of his heart.</t933>
<t934>—I have come to sleep with you —he said.</t934>
<t935>His clothes were smeared with mud and vomit.</t935> <t936>Pilar Ternera, who then lived only with her two younger children, did not ask him any questions.</t936> <t937>She took him to bed.</t937> <t938>She cleaned his face with a damp rag, took off his clothes, and then undressed completely under the mosquito net so her children wouldn't see her if they woke up.</t938> <t939>She had grown tired of waiting for the man who stayed, the men who left, the countless men who lost their way to her house confused by the uncertainty of the cards.</t939> <t940>In the waiting, her skin had cracked, her breasts had emptied, the embers of her heart had died out.</t940> <t941>She searched for Aureliano in the darkness, placed her hand on his belly, and kissed his neck with maternal tenderness.</t941> <t942>“My poor little boy,” she murmured.</t942> <t943>Aureliano shuddered.</t943> <t944>With a calm dexterity, without the slightest stumble, he left behind the cliffs of pain and found Remedios turned into a swamp without horizons, smelling of raw animal and freshly ironed clothes.</t944> <t945>When he surfaced, he was crying.</t945> <t946>First, there were involuntary and broken sobs.</t946> <t947>Then he emptied himself in an unleashed spring, feeling that something swollen and painful had burst inside him.</t947> <t948>She waited, scratching his head with her fingertips, until his body was emptied of the dark matter that wouldn't let him live.</t948> <t949>Then Pilar Ternera asked him: “Who is it?”</t949> <t950>And Aureliano told her.</t950> <t951>She let out the laugh that once scared the pigeons and now didn't even wake the children.</t951> <t952>“You'll have to finish raising her,” she mocked.</t952> <t953>But beneath the mockery, Aureliano found a haven of understanding.</t953> <t954>When he left the room, leaving behind not only the uncertainty of his manhood but also the bitter weight he had borne in his heart for so many months, Pilar Ternera had made him a spontaneous promise.</t954>
<t955>—I'm going to talk to the girl —he said to him—, and you'll see that I'll serve her to you on a silver platter.</t955>
<t956>He fulfilled it.</t956> <t957>But at a bad time, because the house had lost the peace of other days.</t957> <t958>Upon discovering Rebeca's passion, which could not be kept secret due to her screams, Amaranta suffered a bout of fever.</t958> <t959>She too suffered from the thorn of a solitary love.</t959> <t960>Locked in the bathroom, she relieved the torment of a hopeless passion by writing feverish letters that she contented herself with hiding at the bottom of the trunk.</t960> <t961>Úrsula barely managed to take care of the two sick women.</t961> <t962>She did not manage, through prolonged and insidious interrogations, to find out the causes of Amaranta's prostration.</t962> <t963>Finally, in another moment of inspiration, she forced the lock of the trunk and found the letters tied with pink ribbons, swollen with fresh lilies and still wet with tears, addressed to but never sent to Pietro Crespi.</t963> <t964>Crying with fury, she cursed the hour she thought of buying the player piano, prohibited embroidery classes, and decreed a sort of mourning without a dead person that was to last until the daughters gave up their hopes.</t964> <t965>José Arcadio Buendía's intervention was useless, as he had changed his first impression of Pietro Crespi and admired his skill in handling musical machines.</t965> <t966>So when Pilar Ternera told Aureliano that Remedios was determined to marry, he understood that the news would further trouble his parents.</t966> <t967>But he faced the situation.</t967> <t968>Summoned to the sitting room for a formal interview, José Arcadio Buendía and Úrsula listened impassively to their son's declaration.</t968> <t969>However, upon hearing the name of the bride, José Arcadio Buendía flushed with indignation.</t969> <t970>“Love is a plague,” he thundered.</t970> <t971>“With so many pretty and decent girls, the only thing you can think of is to marry the enemy's daughter.”</t971> <t972>But Úrsula agreed with the choice.</t972> <t973>She confessed her affection for the seven Moscote sisters, for their beauty, industriousness, modesty, and good upbringing, and celebrated her son's good judgment.</t973> <t974>Overcome by his wife's enthusiasm, José Arcadio Buendía then set one condition: Rebeca, who was reciprocated, would marry Pietro Crespi.</t974> <t975>Úrsula would take Amaranta on a trip to the provincial capital, when she had time, so that contact with different people would relieve her of her disappointment.</t975> <t976>Rebeca regained her health as soon as she learned of the agreement, and wrote her fiancé a joyful letter that she submitted for her parents' approval and sent by mail without using intermediaries.</t976> <t977>Amaranta pretended to accept the decision and gradually recovered from the fever, but she promised herself that Rebeca would only marry over her dead body.</t977>
<t978>On the following Saturday, José Arcadio Buendía put on the dark wool suit, the celluloid collar, and the suede boots that he had worn for the first time on the night of the party, and went to ask for the hand of Remedios Moscote.</t978> <t979>The magistrate and his wife received him both pleased and troubled, because they were unaware of the purpose of the unexpected visit, and then they thought that he had confused the name of the intended bride.</t979> <t980>To clear up the mistake, the mother woke Remedios and carried her in her arms to the living room, still dazed from sleep.</t980> <t981>They asked her if she was truly determined to get married, and she replied, whimpering, that she only wanted to be left to sleep.</t981> <t982>José Arcadio Buendía, understanding the confusion of the Moscotes, went to clarify things with Aureliano.</t982> <t983>When he returned, the Moscote couple had dressed in formal clothes, rearranged the furniture, and put fresh flowers in the vases, and they awaited him in the company of their older daughters.</t983> <t984>Weighed down by the ingratitude of the occasion and the discomfort of the stiff collar, José Arcadio Buendía confirmed that, indeed, Remedios was the chosen one.</t984> <t985>"This makes no sense," said a dismayed don Apolinar Moscote.</t985> <t986>"We have six more daughters, all single and of marriageable age, who would be delighted to be the worthy wives of serious and hardworking gentlemen like your son, and Aurelito sets his eyes precisely on the only one who still wets the bed."</t986> <t987>His wife, a well-preserved woman with sorrowful eyelids and gestures, reproached him for his impropriety.</t987> <t988>When they finished drinking the fruit shake, they had gladly accepted Aureliano's decision.</t988> <t989>Only that Mrs. Moscote begged the favor of speaking alone with Úrsula.</t989> <t990>Intrigued, protesting that she was being entangled in men's affairs, but actually intimidated by the emotion, Úrsula went to visit her the next day.</t990> <t991>Half an hour later she returned with the news that Remedios was prepubescent.</t991> <t992>Aureliano did not consider it a serious obstacle.</t992> <t993>He had waited so long that he could wait as long as necessary, until the bride was of childbearing age.</t993>
<t994>The regained harmony was only interrupted by the death of Melquíades.</t994> <t995>Although it was a foreseeable event, the circumstances were not.</t995> <t996>A few months after his return, he had undergone such a rapid and critical aging process that he was soon considered one of those useless great-grandfathers who wander like shadows through the bedrooms, dragging their feet, reminiscing aloud about better times, and whom no one really cares about or remembers until the day they are found dead in bed.</t996> <t997>At first, José Arcadio Buendía assisted him in his tasks, enthusiastic about the novelty of daguerreotype photography and Nostradamus's predictions.</t997> <t998>But little by little, he abandoned him to his solitude, as communication became increasingly difficult.</t998> <t999>He was losing his sight and hearing, seemed to confuse his interlocutors with people he had known in remote times of humanity, and answered questions with an intricate jumble of languages.</t999> <t1000>He walked feeling the air, although he moved among things with an inexplicable fluidity, as if endowed with an instinct for orientation based on immediate premonitions.</t1000> <t1001>One day he forgot to put in his dentures, which he left in a glass of water by the bed at night, and he never put them back in.</t1001> <t1002>When Úrsula arranged for the expansion of the house, she had a special room built for him next to Aureliano's workshop, away from the noise and domestic hustle, with a window flooded with light and a shelf where she herself arranged the books almost destroyed by dust and moths, the brittle papers filled with indecipherable signs, and the glass with the dentures where some aquatic plants with tiny yellow flowers had taken root.</t1002> <t1003>The new place seemed to please Melquíades, as he was no longer seen even in the dining room.</t1003> <t1004>He only went to Aureliano's workshop, where he spent hours and hours scribbling his enigmatic literature on the parchments he had brought with him, which seemed to be made of a dry material that crumbled like puff pastry.</t1004> <t1005>There he took the meals that Visitación brought him twice a day, although in recent times he lost his appetite and only ate vegetables.</t1005> <t1006>Soon he acquired the forlorn appearance typical of vegetarians.</t1006> <t1007>His skin became covered with a tender moss, similar to that which thrived on the anachronistic vest he never took off, and his breath exhaled a scent of a sleeping animal.</t1007> <t1008>Aureliano eventually forgot about him, absorbed in writing his verses, but on one occasion he thought he understood something from his droning monologues and paid attention.</t1008> <t1009>In reality, the only thing he could isolate from the stony paragraphs was the insistent hammering of the word equinox equinox equinox, and the name Alexander Von Humboldt.</t1009> <t1010>Arcadio got a little closer to him when he started helping Aureliano in the silversmithing.</t1010> <t1011>Melquíades reciprocated that effort of communication by sometimes uttering phrases in Spanish that had very little to do with reality.</t1011> <t1012>One afternoon, however, he seemed illuminated by a sudden emotion.</t1012> <t1013>Years later, in front of the firing squad, Arcadio would remember the tremor with which Melquíades made him listen to several pages of his impenetrable writing, which he of course did not understand, but which, when read aloud, seemed like sung encyclicals.</t1013> <t1014>Then he smiled for the first time in a long while and said in Spanish: "When I die, burn mercury in my room for three days."</t1014> <t1015>Arcadio told José Arcadio Buendía, and he tried to get more explicit information, but only got one response: "I have achieved immortality."</t1015> <t1016>When Melquíades's breath began to smell, Arcadio took him to bathe in the river on Thursday mornings.</t1016> <t1017>He seemed to improve.</t1017> <t1018>He would undress and get into the water along with the boys, and his mysterious sense of orientation allowed him to avoid deep and dangerous spots.</t1018> <t1019>"We are of the water," he said on one occasion.</t1019> <t1020>Thus, a long time passed without anyone seeing him in the house, except for the night he made a touching effort to repair the player piano, and when he went to the river with Arcadio carrying under his arm the gourd and the corozo soap ball wrapped in a towel.</t1020> <t1021>One Thursday, before they called him to go to the river, Aureliano heard him say: "I have died of fever in the sands of Singapore."</t1021> <t1022>That day he went into the water by a wrong path and was not found until the next morning, several kilometers downstream, stranded in a luminous bend with a solitary buzzard perched on his belly.</t1022> <t1023>Against the scandalized protests of Úrsula, who mourned him more deeply than her own father, José Arcadio Buendía opposed burying him.</t1023> <t1024>"He is immortal," he said, "and he himself revealed the formula for resurrection."</t1024> <t1025>He revived the forgotten athanor and set a cauldron of mercury to boil next to the corpse, which gradually filled with blue bubbles.</t1025> <t1026>Don Apolinar Moscote dared to remind him that an unburied drowned body was a danger to public health.</t1026> <t1027>"None of that, since he is alive," was José Arcadio Buendía's reply, who completed the seventy-two hours of mercurial fumigations when the corpse was already beginning to burst into a livid bloom, whose faint whistles filled the house with a pestilent vapor.</t1027> <t1028>Only then did he allow him to be buried, but not just in any way, but with the honors reserved for the greatest benefactor of Macondo.</t1028> <t1029>It was the first and most attended burial ever seen in the town, surpassed only a century later by the funeral carnival of the Mamá Grande.</t1029> <t1030>He was buried in a tomb erected in the center of the land designated for the cemetery, with a headstone that bore the only thing known about him: MELQUÍADES.</t1030> <t1031>They held his nine nights of wake.</t1031> <t1032>In the tumult gathered in the courtyard to drink coffee, tell jokes, and play cards, Amaranta found an opportunity to confess her love to Pietro Crespi, who a few weeks earlier had formalized his engagement to Rebeca and was setting up a store of musical instruments and wind-up toys in the same area where the Arabs, who once traded trinkets for macaws, vegetated, and which people knew as the Street of the Turks.</t1032> <t1033>The Italian, whose head covered with glossy curls aroused in women an irrepressible need to sigh, treated Amaranta like a capricious little girl not worth taking too seriously.</t1033>
<t1034>—I have a younger brother —he said to her—.</t1034> <t1035>He is going to come help me in the store.</t1035>
<t1036>Amaranta felt humiliated and told Pietro Crespi, with virulent resentment, that she was willing to prevent her sister's wedding even if she had to lay her own corpse across the door.</t1036> <t1037>The Italian was so impressed by the dramatism of the threat that he couldn't resist the temptation to discuss it with Rebeca.</t1037> <t1038>Thus, Amaranta's trip, always postponed due to Úrsula's occupations, was arranged in less than a week.</t1038> <t1039>Amaranta did not resist, but when she gave Rebeca the farewell kiss, she whispered in her ear:</t1039>
<t1040>—Don't get your hopes up.</t1040> <t1041>Even if they take me to the ends of the earth, I will find a way to stop you from getting married, even if I have to kill you.</t1041>
<t1042>With Úrsula's absence, and the invisible presence of Melquíades who continued his stealthy wandering through the rooms, the house seemed enormous and empty.</t1042> <t1043>Rebeca had been left in charge of domestic order, while the Indian woman took care of the bakery.</t1043> <t1044>At dusk, when Pietro Crespi arrived preceded by a fresh breath of lavender and always bringing a toy as a gift, his fiancée received him in the main room with doors and windows open to be safe from any suspicion.</t1044> <t1045>It was an unnecessary precaution, because the Italian had proven to be so respectful that he didn't even touch the hand of the woman who would be his wife within a year.</t1045> <t1046>Those visits gradually filled the house with marvelous toys.</t1046> <t1047>The wind-up dancers, the music boxes, the acrobat monkeys, the trotting horses, the drumming clowns, the rich and astonishing mechanical fauna that Pietro Crespi brought, dispelled José Arcadio Buendía's grief over Melquíades' death, and transported him back to his old alchemist days.</t1047> <t1048>He then lived in a paradise of gutted animals, dismantled mechanisms, trying to perfect them with a continuous motion system based on the principles of the pendulum.</t1048> <t1049>Aureliano, for his part, had neglected the workshop to teach little Remedios to read and write.</t1049> <t1050>At first, the girl preferred her dolls to the man who came every afternoon, and who was the reason she was taken away from her games to be bathed, dressed, and seated in the living room to receive the visit.</t1050> <t1051>But Aureliano's patience and devotion eventually won her over, to the point that she spent many hours with him studying the meaning of letters and drawing in a notebook with colored pencils, little houses with cows in the corrals, and round suns with yellow rays that hid behind the hills.</t1051>
<t1052>Only Rebeca was unhappy with Amaranta's threat.</t1052> <t1053>She knew her sister's character, the haughtiness of her spirit, and was frightened by the virulence of her rancor.</t1053> <t1054>She spent entire hours sucking her thumb in the bathroom, clinging to an exhausting effort of will to not eat dirt.</t1054> <t1055>In search of relief from her anxiety, she called Pilar Ternera to read her future.</t1055> <t1056>After a string of conventional vagueness, Pilar Ternera predicted:</t1056>
<t1057>—You will not be happy as long as your parents remain unburied.</t1057>
<t1058>Rebeca shuddered.</t1058> <t1059>As in the memory of a dream, she saw herself entering the house, very young, with the trunk and the little wooden rocking chair and a sack whose contents she never knew.</t1059> <t1060>She remembered a bald gentleman, dressed in linen and with the collar of his shirt fastened with a gold button, who had nothing to do with the king of cups.</t1060> <t1061>She remembered a very young and very beautiful woman, with warm and perfumed hands, that had nothing in common with the rheumatic hands of the queen of diamonds, and who would put flowers in her hair to take her for a walk in the afternoon through a town with green streets.</t1061>
<t1062>—I don't understand —he said.</t1062>
<t1063>Pilar Ternera seemed bewildered:</t1063>
<t1064>—Me neither, but that's what the cards say.</t1064>
<t1065>Rebeca was so worried about the enigma that she told José Arcadio Buendía, and he scolded her for giving credit to card predictions, but he silently set about searching cupboards and trunks, moving furniture, and turning over beds and floorboards, looking for the bag of bones.</t1065> <t1066>He remembered not having seen it since the times of the reconstruction.</t1066> <t1067>He secretly called the masons, and one of them revealed that he had walled up the bag in some bedroom because it was in his way while working.</t1067> <t1068>After several days of auscultations, with their ears pressed against the walls, they perceived the deep cloc cloc.</t1068> <t1069>They drilled into the wall, and there were the bones in the intact bag.</t1069> <t1070>That same day they buried it in an unmarked grave, improvised next to Melquíades', and José Arcadio Buendía returned to the house freed from a burden that for a moment weighed as heavily on his conscience as the memory of Prudencio Aguilar.</t1070> <t1071>As he passed through the kitchen, he gave Rebeca a kiss on the forehead.</t1071>
<t1072>—Get those bad ideas out of your head —he told her—.</t1072> <t1073>You will be happy.</t1073>
<t1074>Rebeca's friendship opened the doors of the house to Pilar Ternera, which had been closed by Úrsula since Arcadio's birth.</t1074> <t1075>She would arrive at any hour of the day, like a herd of goats, and would unleash her feverish energy on the heaviest chores.</t1075> <t1076>Sometimes she would enter the workshop and help Arcadio sensitize the daguerreotype plates with an efficiency and tenderness that eventually confused him.</t1076> <t1077>That woman bewildered him.</t1077> <t1078>The glow of her skin, her smoky scent, the disorder of her laughter in the darkroom disturbed his focus and made him stumble over things.</t1078>
<t1079>On one occasion Aureliano was there, working on goldsmithing, and Pilar Ternera leaned on the table to admire his patient industriousness.</t1079> <t1080>Suddenly it happened.</t1080> <t1081>Aureliano confirmed that Arcadio was in the darkroom before looking up and meeting Pilar Ternera's eyes, whose thoughts were perfectly visible, as if exposed to the midday light.</t1081>
<t1082>—Alright —said Aureliano—.</t1082> <t1083>Tell me what it is.</t1083>
<t1084>Pilar Ternera bit her lips with a sad smile.</t1084>
<t1085>—That you are good for war —he said—.</t1085> <t1086>Where you set your eye, you set the lead.</t1086>
<t1087>Aureliano rested with the confirmation of the omen.</t1087> <t1088>He went back to concentrating on his work, as if nothing had happened, and his voice took on a calm firmness.</t1088>
<t1089>—I admit it —he said—.</t1089> <t1090>It will bear my name.</t1090>
<t1091>José Arcadio Buendía finally achieved what he was seeking: he connected a wind-up dancer to the clock mechanism, and the toy danced nonstop to its own music for three days.</t1091> <t1092>That discovery excited him much more than any of his wild enterprises.</t1092> <t1093>He stopped eating.</t1093> <t1094>He stopped sleeping.</t1094> <t1095>Without Úrsula's vigilance and care, he let himself be dragged by his imagination into a state of perpetual delirium from which he would never recover.</t1095> <t1096>He spent the nights pacing the room, thinking out loud, looking for ways to apply the principles of the pendulum to ox carts, plowshares, to everything that could be useful when set in motion.</t1096> <t1097>The fever of insomnia wore him out so much that one early morning he couldn't recognize the old man with a white head and uncertain gestures who entered his bedroom.</t1097> <t1098>It was Prudencio Aguilar.</t1098> <t1099>When he finally identified him, amazed that even the dead aged, José Arcadio Buendía was shaken by nostalgia.</t1099> <t1100>“Prudencio,” he exclaimed, “how did you end up so far away!”</t1100> <t1101>After many years of death, the longing for the living was so intense, the need for company so urgent, the proximity of the other death that existed within death so terrifying, that Prudencio Aguilar had ended up loving his worst enemy.</t1101> <t1102>He had been looking for him for a long time.</t1102> <t1103>He asked the dead from Riohacha about him, the dead who arrived from the Valley of Upar, those who came from the swamp, and no one gave him an answer, because Macondo was an unknown town to the dead until Melquíades arrived and marked it with a black dot on the colorful maps of death.</t1103> <t1104>José Arcadio Buendía talked with Prudencio Aguilar until dawn.</t1104> <t1105>A few hours later, exhausted from the vigil, he entered Aureliano's workshop and asked him, “What day is today?”</t1105> <t1106>Aureliano replied that it was Tuesday.</t1106> <t1107>“That's what I thought,” said José Arcadio Buendía.</t1107> <t1108>“But suddenly I realized that it is still Monday like yesterday.</t1108> <t1109>Look at the sky, look at the walls, look at the begonias.</t1109> <t1110>Today is also Monday.”</t1110> <t1111>Used to his quirks, Aureliano paid no attention to him.</t1111> <t1112>The next day, Wednesday, José Arcadio Buendía returned to the workshop.</t1112> <t1113>“This is a disaster,” he said.</t1113> <t1114>“Look at the air, hear the hum of the sun, just like yesterday and the day before.</t1114> <t1115>Today is also Monday.”</t1115> <t1116>That night, Pietro Crespi found him in the corridor, crying with the graceless sob of the old, crying for Prudencio Aguilar, for Melquíades, for Rebeca's parents, for his father and mother, for all those he could remember who were then alone in death.</t1116> <t1117>He gave him a wind-up bear that walked on two legs on a wire, but he couldn't distract him from his obsession.</t1117> <t1118>He asked him what had happened to the project he had explained to him days before, about the possibility of building a pendulum machine that would allow man to fly, and he replied that it was impossible because the pendulum could lift anything into the air but could not lift itself.</t1118> <t1119>On Thursday he reappeared in the workshop with a painful look of scorched earth.</t1119> <t1120>“The time machine has broken down,” he almost sobbed, “and Úrsula and Amaranta are so far away!”</t1120> <t1121>Aureliano scolded him like a child, and he adopted a submissive air.</t1121> <t1122>He spent six hours examining things, trying to find a difference from the way they looked the day before, eager to discover in them some change that would reveal the passage of time.</t1122> <t1123>He spent the whole night in bed with his eyes open, calling out to Prudencio Aguilar, to Melquíades, to all the dead, to come and share his unease.</t1123> <t1124>But no one came.</t1124> <t1125>On Friday, before anyone got up, he went back to watch the appearance of nature until he had no doubt that it was still Monday.</t1125> <t1126>Then he grabbed a door bar and with the wild violence of his immense strength, he smashed the alchemy apparatus, the daguerreotype cabinet, the goldsmith's workshop into dust, shouting like a madman in a high-sounding and fluent but completely incomprehensible language.</t1126> <t1127>He was about to finish off the rest of the house when Aureliano asked the neighbors for help.</t1127> <t1128>It took ten men to knock him down, fourteen to tie him up, twenty to drag him to the chestnut tree in the yard, where they left him tied up, barking in a strange language and foaming green at the mouth.</t1128> <t1129>When Úrsula and Amaranta arrived, he was still tied hand and foot to the trunk of the chestnut tree, soaked by the rain and in a state of total innocence.</t1129> <t1130>They spoke to him, and he looked at them without recognizing them and said something incomprehensible.</t1130> <t1131>Úrsula untied his wrists and ankles, ulcerated by the pressure of the ropes, and left him tied only by the waist.</t1131> <t1132>Later they built him a palm shelter to protect him from the sun and rain.</t1132>
<t1133>Aureliano Buendía and Remedios Moscote were married on a Sunday in March before the altar that Father Nicanor Reyna had built in the visitors' room.</t1133><t1134>It was the culmination of four weeks of upheavals in the Moscote household, as little Remedios reached puberty before outgrowing the habits of childhood.</t1134><t1135>Despite her mother's lessons about the changes of adolescence, one February afternoon she burst into the room where her sisters were talking with Aureliano, shouting in alarm, and showed them her underwear smeared with a chocolaty paste.</t1135><t1136>A month was set for the wedding.</t1136><t1137>There was barely enough time to teach her to wash herself, dress herself, and understand the basic matters of running a household.</t1137><t1138>They made her urinate on hot bricks to correct her bed-wetting habit.</t1138><t1139>It was hard to convince her of the inviolability of marital secrets, because Remedios was so bewildered and at the same time so amazed by the revelation that she wanted to share the details of the wedding night with everyone.</t1139><t1140>It was an exhausting effort, but by the date set for the ceremony, the girl was as skilled in worldly matters as any of her sisters.</t1140><t1141>Don Apolinar Moscote walked her down the flower-adorned street, amidst the sound of fireworks and the music of several bands, and she waved and thanked with a smile those who wished her good luck from the windows.</t1141><t1142>Aureliano, dressed in black cloth, with the same patent leather boots with metal hooks that he would wear a few years later before the firing squad, was intensely pale and had a hard lump in his throat when he received his bride at the door of the house and led her to the altar.</t1142><t1143>She behaved with such naturalness and discretion that she did not lose her composure even when Aureliano dropped the ring while trying to put it on her.</t1143><t1144>Amidst the murmur and the beginning of confusion among the guests, she kept her arm raised with the lace mitten and remained with her ring finger ready, until her groom managed to stop the ring with his boot so it wouldn't roll to the door, and returned blushing to the altar.</t1144><t1145>Her mother and sisters were so anxious that the girl might make a mistake during the ceremony that in the end, they were the ones who committed the impropriety of lifting her up to give her a kiss.</t1145><t1146>From that day on, Remedios revealed the sense of responsibility, natural grace, and calm control that she would always have in the face of adverse circumstances.</t1146><t1147>It was she who, on her own initiative, set aside the best portion of the wedding cake and took it on a plate with a fork to José Arcadio Buendía.</t1147><t1148>Tied to the trunk of the chestnut tree, hunched on a wooden stool under the palm shelter, the enormous old man, discolored by the sun and rain, gave a vague smile of gratitude and ate the cake with his fingers, chewing an unintelligible psalm.</t1148><t1149>The only unhappy person at that boisterous celebration that lasted until dawn on Monday was Rebeca Buendía.</t1149><t1150>It was her frustrated party.</t1150><t1151>By agreement with Úrsula, her wedding was to be celebrated on the same date, but Pietro Crespi received a letter on Friday announcing the imminent death of his mother.</t1151><t1152>The wedding was postponed.</t1152><t1153>Pietro Crespi left for the provincial capital an hour after receiving the letter, and on the way, he crossed paths with his mother who arrived punctually on Saturday night and sang at Aureliano's wedding the sad aria she had prepared for her son's wedding.</t1153><t1154>Pietro Crespi returned at midnight on Sunday to sweep up the ashes of the party, after having exhausted five horses on the way trying to be on time for his wedding.</t1154><t1155>It was never discovered who wrote the letter.</t1155><t1156>Tormented by Úrsula, Amaranta cried in indignation and swore her innocence in front of the altar that the carpenters had not yet finished dismantling.</t1156>
<t1157>Father Nicanor Reyna —whom Don Apolinar Moscote had brought from the swamp to officiate the wedding— was an old man hardened by the ingratitude of his ministry.</t1157> <t1158>He had sad skin, almost just bones, a pronounced and round belly, and an expression of an old angel that was more of innocence than of kindness.</t1158> <t1159>He intended to return to his parish after the wedding, but he was appalled by the aridity of the inhabitants of Macondo, who thrived on scandal, adhered to natural law, without baptizing their children or sanctifying the holidays.</t1159> <t1160>Thinking that no land needed the seed of God as much, he decided to stay one more week to Christianize the circumcised and the gentiles, legalize concubinaries, and sacrament the dying.</t1160> <t1161>But no one paid him any attention.</t1161> <t1162>They replied that for many years they had been without a priest, dealing with the matters of the soul directly with God, and had lost the malice of mortal sin.</t1162> <t1163>Tired of preaching in the desert, Father Nicanor set out to build a temple, the largest in the world, with life-sized saints and colored glass in the walls, so that people would come from Rome to honor God in the center of impiety.</t1163> <t1164>He went everywhere begging for alms with a copper dish.</t1164> <t1165>They gave him a lot, but he wanted more, because the temple had to have a bell whose toll would bring the drowned to the surface.</t1165> <t1166>He pleaded so much that he lost his voice.</t1166> <t1167>His bones began to fill with noises.</t1167> <t1168>One Saturday, not having collected even the value of the doors, he let himself be overcome by despair.</t1168> <t1169>He improvised an altar in the square and on Sunday went around the town with a small bell, as in the times of insomnia, calling for an open-air mass.</t1169> <t1170>Many went out of curiosity.</t1170> <t1171>Others out of nostalgia.</t1171> <t1172>Others so that God would not take their disregard for his intermediary as a personal offense.</t1172> <t1173>So at eight in the morning, half the town was in the square, where Father Nicanor sang the gospels with a voice lacerated by supplication.</t1173> <t1174>At the end, when the attendees began to disperse, he raised his arms as a sign of attention.</t1174>
<t1175>—One moment —he said—.</t1175> <t1176>Now we are going to witness irrefutable proof of the infinite power of God.</t1176>
<t1177>The boy who had assisted at mass brought him a cup of thick, steaming chocolate which he drank without pausing for breath.</t1177> <t1178>Then he wiped his lips with a handkerchief he took from his sleeve, stretched out his arms, and closed his eyes.</t1178> <t1179>Then Father Nicanor rose twelve centimeters above the ground.</t1179> <t1180>It was a convincing demonstration.</t1180> <t1181>He spent several days going from house to house, repeating the levitation test through the stimulus of chocolate, while the altar boy collected so much money in a sack that in less than a month he began the construction of the temple.</t1181> <t1182>No one doubted the divine origin of the demonstration, except for José Arcadio Buendía, who observed without flinching the crowd that one morning gathered around the chestnut tree to witness the revelation once more.</t1182> <t1183>He barely stretched a little on the bench and shrugged when Father Nicanor began to rise from the ground along with the chair he was sitting on.</t1183>
<t1184>—This is the simplest thing —said José Arcadio Buendía—: this man has discovered the fourth state of matter.</t1184>
<t1185>Father Nicanor raised his hand and the four legs of the chair touched the ground at the same time.</t1185>
<t1186>—I deny it —he said—.</t1186> <t1187>This fact undoubtedly proves the existence of God.</t1187>
<t1188>That was how it was discovered that the devilish jargon of José Arcadio Buendía was Latin.</t1188> <t1189>Father Nicanor took advantage of being the only person who had been able to communicate with him to try to instill faith in his disturbed mind.</t1189> <t1190>Every afternoon he would sit next to the chestnut tree, preaching in Latin, but José Arcadio Buendía stubbornly refused to accept rhetorical twists or chocolate transmutations, and demanded as the only proof the daguerreotype of God.</t1190> <t1191>Father Nicanor then brought him medals and holy cards and even a reproduction of Veronica's veil, but José Arcadio Buendía rejected them as artisanal objects without scientific basis.</t1191> <t1192>He was so stubborn that Father Nicanor gave up his evangelization efforts and continued visiting him out of humanitarian feelings.</t1192> <t1193>But then it was José Arcadio Buendía who took the initiative and tried to break the priest's faith with rationalist tricks.</t1193> <t1194>On one occasion, when Father Nicanor brought a board and a box of pieces to the chestnut tree to invite him to play checkers, José Arcadio Buendía did not accept, saying that he could never understand the point of a contest between two opponents who agreed on the principles.</t1194> <t1195>Father Nicanor, who had never seen the game of checkers in that way, could not play it again.</t1195> <t1196>Increasingly astonished by José Arcadio Buendía's lucidity, he asked him how it was possible that they had him tied to a tree.</t1196>
<t1197>—That is the simplest —he replied—: because I am crazy.</t1197>
<t1198>Since then, worried about his own faith, the priest did not visit him again, and devoted himself entirely to hastening the construction of the temple.</t1198> <t1199>Rebeca felt hope revive.</t1199> <t1200>Her future was conditioned on the completion of the work, ever since a Sunday when Father Nicanor was having lunch at the house and the whole family, seated at the table, spoke of the solemnity and splendor that the religious ceremonies would have once the temple was built.</t1200> <t1201>“The most fortunate will be Rebeca,” said Amaranta.</t1201> <t1202>And since Rebeca did not understand what she meant, she explained it with an innocent smile:</t1202>
<t1203>—You're going to have to inaugurate the church with your wedding.</t1203>
<t1204>Rebeca tried to anticipate any comment.</t1204> <t1205>At the pace the construction was going, the temple would not be finished for another ten years.</t1205> <t1206>Father Nicanor did not agree: the growing generosity of the faithful allowed for more optimistic calculations.</t1206> <t1207>In the face of Rebeca's silent indignation, who could not finish her lunch, Úrsula celebrated Amaranta's idea and contributed a considerable amount to hasten the work.</t1207> <t1208>Father Nicanor considered that with another aid like that, the temple would be ready in three years.</t1208> <t1209>From then on, Rebeca did not speak to Amaranta again, convinced that her initiative had not had the innocence she had managed to appear.</t1209> <t1210>"It was the least serious thing I could do," Amaranta replied in the virulent argument they had that night.</t1210> <t1211>"This way I won't have to kill you in the next three years."</t1211> <t1212>Rebeca accepted the challenge.</t1212>
<t1213>When Pietro Crespi learned of the new postponement, he suffered a crisis of disappointment, but Rebeca gave him a definitive proof of loyalty.</t1213><t1214>"We will elope whenever you decide," she said to him.</t1214><t1215>However, Pietro Crespi was not a man of adventures.</t1215><t1216>He lacked the impulsive character of his fiancée, and considered respect for one's word as a capital that could not be squandered.</t1216><t1217>Then Rebeca resorted to bolder methods.</t1217><t1218>A mysterious wind would extinguish the lamps in the visiting room, and Úrsula would catch the couple kissing in the dark.</t1218><t1219>Pietro Crespi gave clumsy explanations about the poor quality of modern tar lamps and even helped install safer lighting systems in the room.</t1219><t1220>But again, the fuel would fail or the wicks would get stuck, and Úrsula would find Rebeca sitting on her fiancé's lap.</t1220><t1221>She ended up not accepting any explanation.</t1221><t1222>She entrusted the responsibility of the bakery to the Indian woman and sat in a rocking chair to supervise the couple's visits, determined not to be defeated by maneuvers that were already old in her youth.</t1222><t1223>"Poor mom," Rebeca would say with mocking indignation, seeing Úrsula yawn in the drowsiness of the visits.</t1223><t1224>"When she dies, she'll haunt that rocking chair."</t1224><t1225>After three months of supervised love, bored with the slow construction that he inspected every day, Pietro Crespi decided to give Father Nicanor the money he needed to finish the temple.</t1225><t1226>Amaranta did not grow impatient.</t1226><t1227>While conversing with the friends who came every afternoon to embroider or knit in the corridor, she tried to conceive new tricks.</t1227><t1228>A miscalculation ruined what she considered the most effective: removing the mothballs that Rebeca had placed on her wedding dress before storing it in the bedroom dresser.</t1228><t1229>She did it when there were less than two months left for the temple's completion.</t1229><t1230>But Rebeca was so impatient with the proximity of the wedding that she wanted to prepare the dress earlier than Amaranta had anticipated.</t1230><t1231>When she opened the dresser and first unwrapped the papers and then the protective cloth, she found the satin of the dress, the lace of the veil, and even the orange blossom crown pulverized by moths.</t1231><t1232>Although she was sure she had put two handfuls of mothballs in the wrapping, the disaster seemed so accidental that she did not dare to blame Amaranta.</t1232><t1233>There was less than a month left for the wedding, but Amparo Moscote committed to sewing a new dress in a week.</t1233><t1234>Amaranta felt faint on the rainy noon when Amparo entered the house wrapped in a froth of lace to give Rebeca the final fitting of the dress.</t1234><t1235>She lost her voice, and a thread of cold sweat ran down the channel of her spine.</t1235><t1236>For long months, she had trembled with fear awaiting that hour, because if she did not conceive the definitive obstacle to Rebeca's wedding, she was sure that at the last moment, when all the resources of her imagination had failed, she would have the courage to poison her.</t1236><t1237>That afternoon, while Rebeca suffocated from the heat inside the satin armor that Amparo Moscote was fitting to her body with a thousand pins and infinite patience, Amaranta made several mistakes in her crochet stitches and pricked her finger with the needle, but she decided with dreadful coldness that the date would be the last Friday before the wedding, and the method would be a dose of laudanum in the coffee.</t1237>
<t1238>A major obstacle, as insurmountable as it was unforeseen, forced a new and indefinite postponement.</t1238><t1239>A week before the scheduled wedding date, little Remedios woke up at midnight drenched in a hot broth that exploded in her insides with a kind of tearing burp, and died three days later poisoned by her own blood with a pair of twins lodged in her belly.</t1239><t1240>Amaranta suffered a crisis of conscience.</t1240><t1241>She had prayed to God with such fervor for something dreadful to happen so she wouldn't have to poison Rebeca, that she felt guilty for Remedios' death.</t1241><t1242>That was not the obstacle she had prayed so much for.</t1242><t1243>Remedios had brought a breath of joy to the house.</t1243><t1244>She had settled with her husband in a room near the workshop, which she decorated with the dolls and toys of her recent childhood, and her cheerful vitality overflowed the four walls of the room and swept like a gust of good health through the begonia corridor.</t1244><t1245>She sang from dawn.</t1245><t1246>She was the only person who dared to mediate in the disputes between Rebeca and Amaranta.</t1246><t1247>She took on the costly task of attending to José Arcadio Buendía.</t1247><t1248>She brought him food, assisted him in his daily needs, washed him with soap and scrub, kept his hair and beard free of lice and nits, maintained the palm shed in good condition, and reinforced it with waterproof tarps during stormy times.</t1248><t1249>In her last months, she had managed to communicate with him in rudimentary Latin phrases.</t1249><t1250>When the son of Aureliano and Pilar Ternera was born and brought to the house and baptized in an intimate ceremony with the name Aureliano José, Remedios decided he should be considered her eldest son.</t1250><t1251>Her maternal instinct surprised Úrsula.</t1251><t1252>Aureliano, for his part, found in her the justification he needed to live.</t1252><t1253>He worked all day in the workshop and Remedios brought him a bowl of unsweetened coffee mid-morning.</t1253><t1254>They both visited the Moscotes every night.</t1254><t1255>Aureliano played endless games of dominoes with his father-in-law, while Remedios conversed with her sisters or dealt with adult matters with her mother.</t1255><t1256>The bond with the Buendía family consolidated the authority of don Apolinar Moscote in the town.</t1256><t1257>In frequent trips to the provincial capital, he managed to get the government to build a school for Arcadio to run, who had inherited his grandfather's educational enthusiasm.</t1257><t1258>He persuaded most of the houses to be painted blue for the national independence celebration.</t1258><t1259>At the urging of Father Nicanor, he arranged for Catarino's shop to be moved to a remote street and closed several scandalous places that thrived in the town center.</t1259><t1260>Once he returned with six policemen armed with rifles to maintain order, without anyone remembering the original commitment not to have armed people in the town.</t1260><t1261>Aureliano was pleased with his father-in-law's efficiency.</t1261><t1262>"You're going to get as fat as he is," his friends told him.</t1262><t1263>But the sedentary lifestyle, which accentuated his cheekbones and concentrated the glow in his eyes, did not increase his weight nor alter the calmness of his character, and on the contrary, it hardened the straight line of solitary meditation and implacable decision on his lips.</t1263><t1264>So deep was the affection that he and his wife had managed to awaken in both families, that when Remedios announced she was going to have a child, even Rebeca and Amaranta made a truce to knit in blue wool, in case it was a boy, and in pink wool, in case it was a girl.</t1264><t1265>She was the last person Arcadio thought of, a few years later, in front of the firing squad.</t1265>
<t1266>Úrsula arranged a mourning period with doors and windows closed, no entry or exit for anyone except for indispensable matters; she forbade speaking out loud for a year, and placed the daguerreotype of Remedios in the spot where the body was laid out, with a black ribbon across it and an oil lamp lit forever.</t1266> <t1267>Future generations, who never let the lamp go out, would be puzzled by that girl with ruffled skirts, white boots, and an organdy bow in her hair, whom they could not reconcile with the academic image of a great-grandmother.</t1267> <t1268>Amaranta took charge of Aureliano José.</t1268> <t1269>She adopted him as a son who would share her solitude and relieve her of the involuntary laudanum that her frantic supplications had poured into Remedios' coffee.</t1269> <t1270>Pietro Crespi would tiptoe in at dusk, with a black ribbon on his hat, and pay a silent visit to a Rebeca who seemed to be bleeding out inside the black dress with sleeves down to her wrists.</t1270> <t1271>The mere idea of thinking about a new date for the wedding would have been so irreverent that the engagement turned into an eternal relationship, a love of exhaustion that no one cared for anymore, as if the lovers who once disassembled lamps to kiss had been abandoned to the whim of death.</t1271> <t1272>Lost and completely demoralized, Rebeca went back to eating earth.</t1272>
<t1273>Suddenly —when the mourning had lasted so long that the cross-stitch sessions had already resumed— someone pushed the street door at two in the afternoon, in the deadly silence of the heat, and the beams trembled with such force in the foundations that Amaranta and her friends embroidering in the corridor, Rebeca sucking her thumb in the bedroom, Úrsula in the kitchen, Aureliano in the workshop, and even José Arcadio Buendía under the solitary chestnut tree, had the impression that an earthquake was unsettling the house.</t1273><t1274>A colossal man was arriving.</t1274><t1275>His square shoulders barely fit through the doors.</t1275><t1276>He had a small medallion of the Virgin of Remedies hanging on his bison neck, his arms and chest completely embroidered with cryptic tattoos, and on his right wrist the tight copper bracelet of the children-on-the-cross.</t1276><t1277>His skin was tanned by the salt of the outdoors, his hair short and cropped like a mule's mane, his jaws ironclad, and his gaze sad.</t1277><t1278>He had a belt twice as thick as a horse's girth, boots with gaiters and spurs, and with ironed heels, and his presence gave the tremulous impression of a seismic shake.</t1278><t1279>He crossed the living room and the sitting room, carrying in his hand some half-destroyed saddlebags, and appeared like thunder in the corridor of begonias, where Amaranta and her friends were paralyzed with their needles in the air.</t1279><t1280>“Hello,” he said to them with a tired voice, and threw the saddlebags on the work table and passed by towards the back of the house.</t1280><t1281>“Hello,” he said to the frightened Rebeca who saw him pass by her bedroom door.</t1281><t1282>“Hello,” he said to Aureliano, who was with all five senses alert at the goldsmith's bench.</t1282><t1283>He did not linger with anyone.</t1283><t1284>He went directly to the kitchen, and there he stopped for the first time at the end of a journey that had started on the other side of the world.</t1284><t1285>“Hello,” he said.</t1285><t1286>Úrsula stayed with her mouth open for a fraction of a second, looked him in the eyes, screamed and jumped to his neck, shouting and crying with joy.</t1286><t1287>It was José Arcadio.</t1287><t1288>He returned as poor as he had left, to the extent that Úrsula had to give him two pesos to pay for the horse's rental.</t1288><t1289>He spoke Spanish mixed with sailor's jargon.</t1289><t1290>They asked him where he had been, and he answered: “Around.”</t1290><t1291>He hung the hammock in the room they assigned to him and slept for three days.</t1291><t1292>When he woke up, and after drinking sixteen raw eggs, he went straight to Catarino's store, where his monumental bulk provoked a panic of curiosity among the women.</t1292><t1293>He ordered music and liquor for everyone at his expense.</t1293><t1294>He arm-wrestled five men at the same time.</t1294><t1295>“It's impossible,” they said, convinced that they couldn't move his arm.</t1295><t1296>“He has children-on-the-cross.”</t1296><t1297>Catarino, who didn't believe in feats of strength, bet twelve pesos that he couldn't move the counter.</t1297><t1298>José Arcadio ripped it from its place, lifted it over his head, and put it out on the street.</t1298><t1299>It took eleven men to bring it back in.</t1299><t1300>In the heat of the party, he displayed on the counter his unbelievable masculinity, entirely tattooed with a blue and red tangle of inscriptions in various languages.</t1300><t1301>To the women who besieged him with their greed, he asked who paid more.</t1301><t1302>The one who had the most offered twenty pesos.</t1302><t1303>Then he proposed to raffle himself among all at ten pesos a number.</t1303><t1304>It was an exorbitant price, because the most sought-after woman earned eight pesos in a night, but they all accepted.</t1304><t1305>They wrote their names on fourteen slips of paper that they put in a hat, and each woman drew one.</t1305><t1306>When only two slips were left to draw, it was established to whom they belonged.</t1306>
<t1307>—Five more pesos each —proposed José Arcadio— and I'll split myself between both of you.</t1307>
<t1308>That was how he made a living.</t1308><t1309>He had circled the globe sixty-five times, enlisted in a crew of stateless sailors.</t1309><t1310>The women who slept with him that night in Catarino's tent took him naked to the dance hall so that everyone could see that he didn't have a millimeter of his body without a tattoo, front and back, from his neck to his toes.</t1310><t1311>He couldn't integrate into the family.</t1311><t1312>He slept all day and spent the night in the red-light district performing feats of strength.</t1312><t1313>On the rare occasions when Úrsula managed to get him to sit at the table, he showed a radiant charm, especially when recounting his adventures in distant lands.</t1313><t1314>He had shipwrecked and spent two weeks adrift in the Sea of Japan, feeding on the body of a companion who succumbed to sunstroke, whose salted and re-salted flesh, cooked in the sun, had a grainy and sweet taste.</t1314><t1315>On a radiant midday in the Bay of Bengal, his ship had defeated a sea dragon in whose belly they found the helmet, buckles, and weapons of a crusader.</t1315><t1316>He had seen in the Caribbean the ghost of Victor Hugues' corsair ship, with sails torn by the winds of death, the rigging gnawed by sea cockroaches, and forever lost on the course to Guadeloupe.</t1316><t1317>Úrsula cried at the table as if she were reading the letters that never arrived, in which José Arcadio recounted his exploits and misadventures.</t1317><t1318>“And so much house here, my son,” she sobbed.</t1318><t1319>“And so much food thrown to the pigs!”</t1319><t1320>But deep down, she couldn't conceive that the boy taken by the gypsies was the same brute who ate half a piglet at lunch and whose flatulence withered the flowers.</t1320><t1321>Something similar happened to the rest of the family.</t1321><t1322>Amaranta couldn't hide the disgust his bestial belches caused her at the table.</t1322><t1323>Arcadio, who never knew the secret of his parentage, barely answered the questions he asked with the evident purpose of winning his affections.</t1323><t1324>Aureliano tried to revive the times when they slept in the same room, tried to restore the complicity of childhood, but José Arcadio had forgotten them because the life at sea had saturated his memory with too many things to remember.</t1324><t1325>Only Rebeca succumbed to the first impact.</t1325><t1326>The afternoon she saw him pass in front of her bedroom, she thought Pietro Crespi was a dandy weakling compared to that prime male whose volcanic breath was felt throughout the house.</t1326><t1327>She sought his proximity with any excuse.</t1327><t1328>On one occasion, José Arcadio looked at her body with blatant attention and said, “You are very much a woman, little sister.”</t1328><t1329>Rebeca lost control of herself.</t1329><t1330>She went back to eating earth and lime from the walls with the avidity of old days, and sucked her thumb with such anxiety that a callus formed on it.</t1330><t1331>She vomited a green liquid with dead leeches.</t1331><t1332>She spent sleepless nights shivering with fever, fighting delirium, waiting until the house trembled with José Arcadio's return at dawn.</t1332><t1333>One afternoon, when everyone was napping, she couldn't resist any longer and went to his bedroom.</t1333><t1334>She found him in his underwear, awake, lying in the hammock he had hung from the beams with ship mooring cables.</t1334><t1335>His enormous tattooed nakedness impressed her so much that she felt the urge to retreat.</t1335><t1336>“Excuse me,” she apologized.</t1336><t1337>“I didn't know you were here.”</t1337><t1338>But she lowered her voice so as not to wake anyone.</t1338><t1339>“Come here,” he said.</t1339><t1340>Rebeca obeyed.</t1340><t1341>She stopped next to the hammock, sweating ice, feeling knots form in her stomach, while José Arcadio caressed her ankles with his fingertips, then her calves, and then her thighs, murmuring, “Oh, little sister; oh, little sister.”</t1341><t1342>She had to make a supernatural effort not to die when an astonishingly regulated cyclonic force lifted her by the waist, stripped her of her intimacy with three claw swipes, and dismembered her like a little bird.</t1342><t1343>She managed to thank God for being born before losing consciousness in the inconceivable pleasure of that unbearable pain, splashing in the steaming swamp of the hammock that absorbed the explosion of her blood like blotting paper.</t1343>
<t1344>Three days later they got married at the five o'clock mass.</t1344> <t1345>José Arcadio had gone to Pietro Crespi's shop the day before.</t1345> <t1346>He had found him giving a zither lesson and did not take him aside to talk to him.</t1346> <t1347>"I'm marrying Rebeca," he said to him.</t1347> <t1348>Pietro Crespi turned pale, handed the zither to one of his students, and ended the class.</t1348> <t1349>When they were alone in the room crowded with musical instruments and clockwork toys, Pietro Crespi said:</t1349>
<t1350>—It's his sister.</t1350>
<t1351>—I don't care —replied José Arcadio.</t1351>
<t1352>Pietro Crespi wiped his forehead with a lavender-scented handkerchief.</t1352>
<t1353>—It is against nature —he explained— and, moreover, the law prohibits it.</t1353>
<t1354>José Arcadio grew impatient not so much with the argument as with Pietro Crespi's paleness.</t1354>
<t1355>—I shit twice on nature —he said—.</t1355> <t1356>And I'm telling you this so you don't bother going to ask Rebeca anything.</t1356>
<t1357>But his brutal behavior was shattered upon seeing Pietro Crespi's eyes fill with tears.</t1357>
<t1358>—Now —he said to him in a different tone—, if what you like is family, then there's Amaranta for you.</t1358>
<t1359>Father Nicanor revealed in the Sunday sermon that José Arcadio and Rebeca were not siblings.</t1359> <t1360>Úrsula never forgave what she considered an inconceivable lack of respect, and when they returned from church, she forbade the newlyweds from ever setting foot in the house again.</t1360> <t1361>To her, it was as if they had died.</t1361> <t1362>So they rented a small house in front of the cemetery and settled in it with no more furniture than José Arcadio's hammock.</t1362> <t1363>On their wedding night, Rebeca was bitten on the foot by a scorpion that had crawled into her slipper.</t1363> <t1364>Her tongue went numb, but that did not prevent them from having a scandalous honeymoon.</t1364> <t1365>The neighbors were frightened by the screams that woke up the entire neighborhood up to eight times in one night, and up to three times during the siesta, and they prayed that such an unbridled passion would not disturb the peace of the dead.</t1365>
<t1366>Aureliano was the only one who cared about them.</t1366> <t1367>He bought them some furniture and provided them with money until José Arcadio regained his sense of reality and began to work the no-man's land that bordered the house's yard.</t1367> <t1368>Amaranta, on the other hand, never managed to overcome her resentment towards Rebeca, although life offered her a satisfaction she had never dreamed of: on Úrsula's initiative, who did not know how to repair the shame, Pietro Crespi continued to have lunch at the house on Tuesdays, overcoming the failure with serene dignity.</t1368> <t1369>He kept the black ribbon on his hat as a sign of appreciation for the family, and he delighted in showing his affection to Úrsula by bringing her exotic gifts: Portuguese sardines, Turkish rose jam, and on one occasion, a beautiful Manila shawl.</t1369> <t1370>Amaranta attended to him with affectionate diligence.</t1370> <t1371>She guessed his tastes, removed the loose threads from the cuffs of his shirt, and embroidered a dozen handkerchiefs with his initials for his birthday.</t1371> <t1372>On Tuesdays, after lunch, while she embroidered in the corridor, he kept her cheerful company.</t1372> <t1373>For Pietro Crespi, that woman whom he always considered and treated as a child, was a revelation.</t1373> <t1374>Although her type lacked grace, she had a rare sensitivity to appreciate the things of the world, and a secret tenderness.</t1374> <t1375>One Tuesday, when no one doubted that sooner or later it had to happen, Pietro Crespi asked her to marry him.</t1375> <t1376>She did not interrupt her work.</t1376> <t1377>She waited for the hot blush of her ears to pass and gave her voice a serene emphasis of maturity.</t1377>
<t1378>—Of course, Crespi —he said—, but when one knows oneself better.</t1378> <t1379>It is never good to rush things.</t1379>
<t1380>Úrsula became flustered.</t1380> <t1381>Despite the affection she had for Pietro Crespi, she couldn't determine whether his decision was good or bad from a moral standpoint, after the prolonged and noisy courtship with Rebeca.</t1381> <t1382>But she ended up accepting it as an unqualified fact, because no one shared her doubts.</t1382> <t1383>Aureliano, who was the man of the house, confused her even more with his enigmatic and definitive opinion:</t1383>
<t1384>—These are not the hours to be thinking about marriages.</t1384>
<t1385>That opinion, which Úrsula only understood some months later, was the only sincere one that Aureliano could express at that moment, not only regarding marriage but any matter that wasn't war.</t1385><t1386>He himself, in front of the firing squad, did not quite understand how the series of subtle but irrevocable coincidences that led him to that point had unfolded.</t1386><t1387>Remedios' death did not produce the shock he feared.</t1387><t1388>It was rather a dull feeling of rage that gradually dissolved into a solitary and passive frustration, similar to what he experienced in the times when he was resigned to living without a woman.</t1388><t1389>He plunged back into work, but kept the habit of playing dominoes with his father-in-law.</t1389><t1390>In a house silenced by mourning, the nightly conversations consolidated the friendship between the two men.</t1390><t1391>"Remarry, Aurelito," his father-in-law would say.</t1391><t1392>"I have six daughters to choose from."</t1392><t1393>On one occasion, on the eve of the elections, Don Apolinar Moscote returned from one of his frequent trips, worried about the country's political situation.</t1393><t1394>The liberals were determined to go to war.</t1394><t1395>Since Aureliano had very confused notions at that time about the differences between conservatives and liberals, his father-in-law gave him schematic lessons.</t1395><t1396>The liberals, he said, were masons; people of bad character, supporters of hanging priests, implementing civil marriage and divorce, recognizing equal rights for natural children as for legitimate ones, and tearing the country apart into a federal system that stripped the supreme authority of its powers.</t1396><t1397>The conservatives, on the other hand, who had received power directly from God, advocated for the stability of public order and family morals; they were the defenders of the faith of Christ, the principle of authority, and were not willing to allow the country to be dismembered into autonomous entities.</t1397><t1398>Out of humanitarian sentiments, Aureliano sympathized with the liberal stance regarding the rights of natural children, but still did not understand how it came to the point of waging a war over things that could not be touched with hands.</t1398><t1399>It seemed an exaggeration to him that his father-in-law had six soldiers armed with rifles, led by a sergeant, sent for the elections in a town without political passions.</t1399><t1400>Not only did they arrive, but they went from house to house confiscating hunting weapons, machetes, and even kitchen knives, before distributing the blue ballots with the names of the conservative candidates and the red ballots with the names of the liberal candidates among men over twenty-one years old.</t1400><t1401>On the eve of the elections, Don Apolinar Moscote himself read an edict that prohibited, from midnight on Saturday and for forty-eight hours, the sale of alcoholic beverages and the gathering of more than three people who were not from the same family.</t1401><t1402>The elections passed without incident.</t1402><t1403>From eight o'clock on Sunday morning, the wooden ballot box was set up in the square, guarded by the six soldiers.</t1403><t1404>Voting took place with complete freedom, as Aureliano himself could verify, who spent almost the entire day with his father-in-law ensuring that no one voted more than once.</t1404><t1405>At four in the afternoon, a drum roll in the square announced the end of the day, and Don Apolinar Moscote sealed the ballot box with a label crossed with his signature.</t1405><t1406>That night, while playing dominoes with Aureliano, he ordered the sergeant to break the label to count the votes.</t1406><t1407>There were almost as many red ballots as blue ones, but the sergeant left only ten red ones and made up the difference with blue ones.</t1407><t1408>Then they resealed the ballot box with a new label and the next day, first thing in the morning, they took it to the provincial capital.</t1408><t1409>"The liberals will go to war," said Aureliano.</t1409><t1410>Don Apolinar did not take his eyes off his domino pieces.</t1410><t1411>"If you say it because of the ballot changes, they won't," he said.</t1411><t1412>"Some red ones are left so there are no complaints."</t1412><t1413>Aureliano understood the disadvantages of the opposition.</t1413><t1414>"If I were a liberal," he said, "I would go to war over this ballot issue."</t1414><t1415>His father-in-law looked at him over the rim of his glasses.</t1415>
<t1416>—Oh, Aurelito —he said—, if you were a liberal, even if you were my son-in-law, you wouldn't have seen the ballot change.</t1416>
<t1417>What actually caused indignation among the people was not the election results, but the fact that the soldiers had not returned the weapons.</t1417> <t1418>A group of women spoke with Aureliano to get his father-in-law to return the kitchen knives.</t1418> <t1419>Don Apolinar Moscote explained to him, in strict confidence, that the soldiers had taken the confiscated weapons as proof that the liberals were preparing for war.</t1419> <t1420>The cynicism of the statement alarmed him.</t1420> <t1421>He made no comment, but one night when Gerineldo Márquez and Magnífico Visbal were talking with other friends about the knife incident, they asked him if he was a liberal or a conservative.</t1421> <t1422>Aureliano did not hesitate:</t1422>
<t1423>—If I had to be something, I would be a liberal —he said—, because conservatives are cheaters.</t1423>
<t1424>The next day, at the insistence of his friends, he went to visit Dr. Alirio Noguera to treat a supposed liver pain.</t1424> <t1425>He didn't even know what the point of the ruse was.</t1425> <t1426>Dr. Alirio Noguera had arrived in Macondo a few years earlier with a kit of tasteless globules and a medical motto that convinced no one: One nail drives out another.</t1426> <t1427>In reality, he was a fraud.</t1427> <t1428>Behind his innocent facade of an unprestigious doctor hid a terrorist who covered the scars on his ankles from five years in stocks with half-leg gaiters.</t1428> <t1429>Captured in the first federalist adventure, he managed to escape to Curaçao disguised in the outfit he most detested in this world: a cassock.</t1429> <t1430>After a prolonged exile, spurred on by the exalted news brought to Curaçao by exiles from all over the Caribbean, he boarded a smugglers' schooner and appeared in Riohacha with the vials of globules that were nothing more than refined sugar, and a diploma from the University of Leipzig forged by himself.</t1430> <t1431>He cried in disappointment.</t1431> <t1432>The federalist fervor, which the exiles described as a powder keg about to explode, had dissolved into a vague electoral illusion.</t1432> <t1433>Bitter from the failure, anxious for a safe place to await old age, the fake homeopath took refuge in Macondo.</t1433> <t1434>In the narrow room crammed with empty bottles that he rented beside the plaza, he lived for several years off hopeless patients who, after trying everything, consoled themselves with sugar globules.</t1434> <t1435>His agitator instincts remained dormant while Don Apolinar Moscote was a decorative authority.</t1435> <t1436>His time was spent remembering and fighting asthma.</t1436> <t1437>The proximity of the elections was the thread that allowed him to find the skein of subversion again.</t1437> <t1438>He established contact with the young people of the town, who lacked political training, and embarked on a stealthy campaign of instigation.</t1438> <t1439>The numerous red ballots that appeared in the ballot box, which Don Apolinar Moscote attributed to the novelty-seeking nature of youth, were part of his plan: he forced his disciples to vote to convince them that elections were a farce.</t1439> <t1440>"The only effective thing," he said, "is violence."</t1440> <t1441>Most of Aureliano's friends were enthusiastic about the idea of overthrowing the conservative order, but no one had dared to include him in the plans, not only because of his ties to the magistrate but also because of his solitary and evasive nature.</t1441> <t1442>It was also known that he had voted blue at his father-in-law's suggestion.</t1442> <t1443>So it was a simple coincidence that revealed his political feelings, and it was pure curiosity that got him involved in the whim of visiting the doctor to treat a pain he didn't have.</t1443> <t1444>In the cubbyhole smelling of camphorated cobwebs, he found a sort of dusty iguana whose lungs whistled as he breathed.</t1444> <t1445>Before asking him any questions, the doctor took him to the window and examined the inside of his lower eyelid.</t1445> <t1446>"It's not there," said Aureliano, as he had been instructed.</t1446> <t1447>He pressed his liver with his fingertips and added, "It's here where I have the pain that won't let me sleep."</t1447> <t1448>Then Dr. Noguera closed the window under the pretext that there was too much sun and explained in simple terms why it was a patriotic duty to kill the conservatives.</t1448> <t1449>For several days, Aureliano carried a small vial in his shirt pocket.</t1449> <t1450>He would take it out every two hours, put three globules in the palm of his hand, and throw them into his mouth to dissolve slowly on his tongue.</t1450> <t1451>Don Apolinar Moscote mocked his faith in homeopathy, but those in the plot recognized him as one of their own.</t1451> <t1452>Almost all the children of the founders were involved, although none knew concretely what the action they were plotting consisted of.</t1452> <t1453>However, the day the doctor revealed the secret to Aureliano, he backed out of the conspiracy.</t1453> <t1454>Although he was then convinced of the urgency of overthrowing the conservative regime, the plan horrified him.</t1454> <t1455>Dr. Noguera was a mystic of personal attack.</t1455> <t1456>His system was reduced to coordinating a series of individual actions that, in a masterstroke of national scope, would eliminate the regime's officials along with their respective families, especially the children, to exterminate conservatism at its root.</t1456> <t1457>Don Apolinar Moscote, his wife, and their six daughters were, of course, on the list.</t1457>
<t1458>—You are neither a liberal nor anything —Aureliano told him without getting upset—.</t1458> <t1459>You are nothing but a butcher.</t1459>
<t1460>—In that case —replied the doctor with equal calm— give me back the little bottle.</t1460> <t1461>You don't need it anymore.</t1461>
<t1462>Only six months later did Aureliano learn that the doctor had written him off as a man of action, deeming him a sentimentalist with no future, a passive character, and a defined solitary vocation.</t1462> <t1463>They tried to corner him, fearing he would denounce the conspiracy.</t1463> <t1464>Aureliano reassured them: he wouldn't say a word, but the night they went to kill the Moscote family, they would find him defending the door.</t1464> <t1465>He demonstrated such a convincing resolve that the plan was postponed indefinitely.</t1465> <t1466>It was around that time that Úrsula sought his opinion on the marriage of Pietro Crespi and Amaranta, and he replied that the times were not right for thinking about that.</t1466> <t1467>For a week, he had been carrying an archaic pistol under his shirt.</t1467> <t1468>He was watching his friends.</t1468> <t1469>In the afternoons, he would go for coffee with José Arcadio and Rebeca, who were starting to organize their house, and from seven o'clock, he played dominoes with his father-in-law.</t1469> <t1470>At lunchtime, he conversed with Arcadio, who was already a monumental adolescent, and found him increasingly excited about the imminence of war.</t1470> <t1471>At school, where Arcadio had students older than him mixed with children who were just beginning to speak, the liberal fever had taken hold.</t1471> <t1472>There was talk of executing Father Nicanor, converting the temple into a school, and implementing free love.</t1472> <t1473>Aureliano tried to temper his impulses.</t1473> <t1474>He recommended discretion and prudence.</t1474> <t1475>Deaf to his calm reasoning and sense of reality, Arcadio publicly reproached him for his weakness of character.</t1475> <t1476>Aureliano waited.</t1476> <t1477>Finally, at the beginning of December, Úrsula burst into the workshop, distraught.</t1477>
<t1478>—The war has broken out!</t1478>
<t1479>Indeed, it had broken out three months ago.</t1479> <t1480>Martial law prevailed throughout the country.</t1480> <t1481>The only one who knew in time was Don Apolinar Moscote, but he did not give the news even to his wife, while the army platoon that was to occupy the town by surprise was arriving.</t1481> <t1482>They entered silently before dawn, with two pieces of light artillery pulled by mules, and established the barracks in the school.</t1482> <t1483>A curfew was imposed at six in the evening.</t1483> <t1484>A more drastic search than the previous one was carried out, house by house, and this time they even took the farming tools.</t1484> <t1485>They dragged out Dr. Noguera, tied him to a tree in the square, and executed him without trial.</t1485> <t1486>Father Nicanor tried to impress the military authorities with the miracle of levitation, and a soldier smashed his head with a rifle butt.</t1486> <t1487>The liberal exaltation faded into a silent terror.</t1487> <t1488>Aureliano, pale and inscrutable, continued playing dominoes with his father-in-law.</t1488> <t1489>He understood that despite his current title of civil and military chief of the town, Don Apolinar Moscote was once again a decorative authority.</t1489> <t1490>The decisions were made by an army captain who every morning collected an extraordinary levy for the defense of public order.</t1490> <t1491>Four soldiers under his command took a woman who had been bitten by a rabid dog from her family and killed her with rifle butts in the middle of the street.</t1491> <t1492>One Sunday, two weeks after the occupation, Aureliano entered Gerineldo Márquez's house and with his usual calm asked for a bowl of coffee without sugar.</t1492> <t1493>When the two were alone in the kitchen, Aureliano gave his voice an authority that had never been known in him.</t1493> <t1494>“Prepare the boys,” he said.</t1494> <t1495>“We are going to war.”</t1495> <t1496>Gerineldo Márquez did not believe him.</t1496>
<t1497>—With what weapons? —he asked.</t1497>
<t1498>—With theirs —Aureliano replied.</t1498>
<t1499>On Tuesday at midnight, in a reckless operation, twenty-one men under thirty years old led by Aureliano Buendía, armed with table knives and sharpened irons, took the garrison by surprise, seized the weapons, and executed in the courtyard the captain and the four soldiers who had murdered the woman.</t1499>
<t1500>That same night, while the firing squad's volleys were heard, Arcadio was named the civil and military chief of the town.</t1500> <t1501>The married rebels barely had time to say goodbye to their wives, whom they left to fend for themselves.</t1501> <t1502>They left at dawn, acclaimed by the population freed from terror, to join the forces of the revolutionary general Victorio Medina, who according to the latest news was in the vicinity of Manaure.</t1502> <t1503>Before leaving, Aureliano pulled Don Apolinar Moscote out of a wardrobe.</t1503> <t1504>"You stay calm, father-in-law," he said to him.</t1504> <t1505>"The new government guarantees, on its word of honor, your personal safety and that of your family."</t1505> <t1506>Don Apolinar Moscote had difficulty identifying that conspirator with high boots and a rifle slung over his back with the man he had played dominoes with until nine o'clock at night.</t1506>
<t1507>—This is nonsense, Aurelito —he exclaimed.</t1507>
<t1508>—No nonsense —said Aureliano—.</t1508> <t1509>It's war.</t1509> <t1510>And don't call me Aurelito anymore, I am now Colonel Aureliano Buendía.</t1510>
<t1511>Colonel Aureliano Buendía promoted thirty-two armed uprisings and lost them all.</t1511> <t1512>He had seventeen male children by seventeen different women, who were exterminated one by one in a single night, before the oldest turned thirty-five years old.</t1512> <t1513>He escaped fourteen assassination attempts, seventy-three ambushes, and a firing squad.</t1513> <t1514>He survived a dose of strychnine in his coffee that would have been enough to kill a horse.</t1514> <t1515>He rejected the Order of Merit that the president of the republic awarded him.</t1515> <t1516>He became the general commander of the revolutionary forces, with jurisdiction and command from one border to the other, and the most feared man by the government, but he never allowed a photograph to be taken of him.</t1516> <t1517>He declined the lifetime pension offered to him after the war and lived to old age on the goldfish he made in his workshop in Macondo.</t1517> <t1518>Although he always fought at the front of his men, the only wound he received was self-inflicted after signing the capitulation of Neerlandia, which ended almost twenty years of civil wars.</t1518> <t1519>He shot himself in the chest with a pistol, and the bullet exited through his back without injuring any vital organs.</t1519> <t1520>The only thing that remained from all of that was a street with his name in Macondo.</t1520> <t1521>However, as he declared a few years before dying of old age, he did not even expect that on the morning he left with his twenty-one men to join the forces of General Victorio Medina.</t1521>
<t1522>—We leave Macondo to you —was all he said to Arcadio before leaving—.</t1522> <t1523>We leave it in good shape, make sure we find it better.</t1523>
<t1524>Arcadio gave a very personal interpretation to the recommendation.</t1524> <t1525>He invented a uniform with marshal's stripes and epaulets, inspired by the illustrations in one of Melquíades' books, and hung the saber with golden tassels of the executed captain at his waist.</t1525> <t1526>He placed the two artillery pieces at the entrance of the town, uniformed his former students, exacerbated by his incendiary proclamations, and let them wander armed through the streets to give outsiders an impression of invulnerability.</t1526> <t1527>It was a double-edged trick because the government did not dare attack the plaza for ten months, but when it did, it unleashed such a disproportionate force that it crushed the resistance in half an hour.</t1527> <t1528>From the first day of his mandate, Arcadio revealed his fondness for decrees.</t1528> <t1529>He read up to four daily to order and arrange everything that crossed his mind.</t1529> <t1530>He implemented mandatory military service from the age of eighteen, declared animals that roamed the streets after six in the evening to be of public utility, and imposed on adult men the obligation to wear a red armband.</t1530> <t1531>He confined Father Nicanor in the parish house under threat of execution and forbade him from saying mass or ringing the bells except to celebrate liberal victories.</t1531> <t1532>To ensure no one doubted the severity of his intentions, he ordered a firing squad to train in the public square by shooting at a scarecrow.</t1532> <t1533>At first, no one took him seriously.</t1533> <t1534>After all, they were just schoolboys playing at being grown-ups.</t1534> <t1535>But one night, when Arcadio entered Catarino's store, the band's trumpeter greeted him with a fanfare that provoked the laughter of the customers, and Arcadio had him executed for disrespecting authority.</t1535> <t1536>Those who protested were put on bread and water with their ankles in a stock he installed in a room of the school.</t1536> <t1537>"You are a murderer!" Úrsula would shout at him every time she learned of a new atrocity.</t1537> <t1538>"When Aureliano finds out, he will have you executed, and I will be the first to rejoice."</t1538> <t1539>But it was all in vain.</t1539> <t1540>Arcadio continued tightening the screws of unnecessary rigor until he became the cruelest ruler Macondo had ever known.</t1540> <t1541>"Now suffer the difference," said Don Apolinar Moscote on one occasion.</t1541> <t1542>"This is the liberal paradise."</t1542> <t1543>Arcadio found out.</t1543> <t1544>Leading a patrol, he stormed the house, destroyed the furniture, beat the daughters, and dragged Don Apolinar Moscote away.</t1544> <t1545>When Úrsula burst into the barracks courtyard, after crossing the town clamoring with shame and brandishing a tarred whip in rage, Arcadio himself was about to give the order to fire to the firing squad.</t1545>
<t1546>—Dare, bastard! —shouted Úrsula.</t1546>
<t1547>Before Arcadio had time to react, she delivered the first lash.</t1547> <t1548>"Dare, murderer," she shouted.</t1548> <t1549>"And kill me too, you son of a bad mother.</t1549> <t1550>That way I won't have eyes to cry over the shame of having raised a monster."</t1550> <t1551>Whipping him mercilessly, she chased him to the back of the yard, where Arcadio curled up like a snail.</t1551> <t1552>Don Apolinar Moscote was unconscious, tied to the post where they had previously kept the scarecrow, torn apart by training shots.</t1552> <t1553>The boys of the platoon scattered, fearful that Úrsula would end up venting her anger on them.</t1553> <t1554>But she didn't even look at them.</t1554> <t1555>She left Arcadio with his uniform dragging, roaring in pain and rage, and untied Don Apolinar Moscote to take him to his house.</t1555> <t1556>Before leaving the barracks, she released the prisoners from the stocks.</t1556>
<t1557>From then on, it was she who ruled the town.</t1557> <t1558>She reinstated Sunday mass, suspended the use of red armbands, and disqualified the arbitrary edicts.</t1558> <t1559>But despite her strength, she continued to mourn the misfortune of her fate.</t1559> <t1560>She felt so alone that she sought the useless company of her husband forgotten under the chestnut tree.</t1560> <t1561>"Look at what we've come to," she would say, while the June rains threatened to bring down the palm shelter.</t1561> <t1562>"Look at the empty house, our children scattered around the world, and the two of us alone again like at the beginning."</t1562> <t1563>José Arcadio Buendía, sunk in an abyss of unconsciousness, was deaf to her laments.</t1563> <t1564>At the onset of his madness, he would announce his daily urgencies with pressing Latin phrases.</t1564> <t1565>In fleeting moments of lucidity, when Amaranta brought him food, he would communicate his most bothersome grievances and would submit docilely to her cupping and mustard plasters.</t1565> <t1566>But by the time Úrsula went to lament by his side, he had lost all contact with reality.</t1566> <t1567>She would bathe him in parts while he sat on the little stool, giving him news of the family.</t1567> <t1568>"Aureliano has gone to war, it's been more than four months now, and we haven't heard from him," she would say, scrubbing his back with a soapy sponge.</t1568> <t1569>"José Arcadio came back, a big man taller than you and all embroidered in cross-stitch, but he only came to bring shame to our house."</t1569> <t1570>She thought she observed, however, that her husband grew sad with the bad news.</t1570> <t1571>So she opted to lie to him.</t1571> <t1572>"Don't believe what I'm telling you," she would say, while sprinkling ashes over his excrement to collect it with the shovel.</t1572> <t1573>"God wanted José Arcadio and Rebeca to get married, and now they are very happy."</t1573> <t1574>She became so sincere in the deceit that she herself ended up consoling herself with her own lies.</t1574> <t1575>"Arcadio is already a serious man," she would say, "and very brave, and very handsome in his uniform and with his saber."</t1575> <t1576>It was like talking to a dead man, because José Arcadio Buendía was already beyond the reach of any concern.</t1576> <t1577>But she insisted.</t1577> <t1578>She saw him so meek, so indifferent to everything, that she decided to untie him.</t1578> <t1579>He didn't even move from the little stool.</t1579> <t1580>He remained exposed to the sun and the rain, as if the ropes were unnecessary, because a force superior to any visible tie kept him bound to the trunk of the chestnut tree.</t1580> <t1581>By the month of August, when the winter began to seem eternal, Úrsula was finally able to give him news that seemed true.</t1581>
<t1582>—Notice that good luck keeps hounding us —he said to her—.</t1582> <t1583>Amaranta and the Italian from the pianola are going to get married.</t1583>
<t1584>Amaranta and Pietro Crespi, indeed, had deepened their friendship, sheltered by Úrsula's trust, who this time did not find it necessary to monitor the visits.</t1584><t1585>It was a twilight courtship.</t1585><t1586>The Italian would arrive at dusk, with a gardenia in his buttonhole, and translate Petrarch's sonnets for Amaranta.</t1586><t1587>They would stay in the corridor suffocated by oregano and roses, he reading and she weaving bobbin lace, indifferent to the shocks and bad news of the war, until the mosquitoes forced them to take refuge in the living room.</t1587><t1588>Amaranta's sensitivity, her discreet but enveloping tenderness, had woven around the suitor an invisible web that he had to physically push aside with his pale, ringless fingers to leave the house at eight.</t1588><t1589>They had made a precious album with the postcards that Pietro Crespi received from Italy.</t1589><t1590>They were images of lovers in solitary parks, with vignettes of pierced hearts and golden ribbons held by doves.</t1590><t1591>"I know this park in Florence," Pietro Crespi would say, going through the postcards.</t1591><t1592>"One extends a hand and the birds come down to eat."</t1592><t1593>Sometimes, before a watercolor of Venice, nostalgia would transform the smell of mud and rotten seafood from the canals into the warm aromas of flowers.</t1593><t1594>Amaranta would sigh, laugh, dream of a second homeland of beautiful men and women who spoke a child's language, with ancient cities whose past grandeur was only evidenced by the cats among the ruins.</t1594><t1595>After crossing the ocean in search of it, after confusing it with passion in Rebeca's vehement caresses, Pietro Crespi had found love.</t1595><t1596>Happiness brought prosperity with it.</t1596><t1597>His store then occupied almost an entire block, and it was a fantasy greenhouse, with reproductions of the Florence bell tower that chimed the hour with a carillon concert, and musical boxes from Sorrento, and Chinese powder boxes that sang five-note tunes when opened, and all the musical instruments one could imagine and all the mechanical devices one could conceive.</t1597><t1598>Bruno Crespi, his younger brother, was in charge of the store, because he couldn't keep up with the demands of the music school.</t1598><t1599>Thanks to him, the Street of the Turks, with its dazzling display of trinkets, became a melodic haven to forget Arcadio's arbitrariness and the distant nightmare of the war.</t1599><t1600>When Úrsula arranged for the resumption of Sunday mass, Pietro Crespi donated a German harmonium to the church, organized a children's choir, and prepared a Gregorian repertoire that added a splendid note to Father Nicanor's taciturn ritual.</t1600><t1601>No one doubted that he would make Amaranta a happy wife.</t1601><t1602>Without rushing their feelings, letting themselves be carried by the natural flow of the heart, they reached a point where all that was left was to set the wedding date.</t1602><t1603>They would find no obstacles.</t1603><t1604>Úrsula privately blamed herself for having twisted Rebeca's fate with repeated postponements, and she was not willing to accumulate more remorse.</t1604><t1605>The rigor of mourning for Remedios' death had been relegated to a secondary place by the mortification of the war, Aureliano's absence, Arcadio's brutality, and the expulsion of José Arcadio and Rebeca.</t1605><t1606>In the face of the imminent wedding, Pietro Crespi himself had suggested that Aureliano José, in whom he had fostered an almost paternal affection, be considered his eldest son.</t1606><t1607>Everything suggested that Amaranta was heading towards an untroubled happiness.</t1607><t1608>But unlike Rebeca, she did not show the slightest anxiety.</t1608><t1609>With the same patience with which she adorned tablecloths and wove exquisite trimmings and embroidered peacocks in cross-stitch, she waited for Pietro Crespi to no longer bear the urgencies of the heart.</t1609><t1610>Her moment came with the ominous rains of October.</t1610><t1611>Pietro Crespi took the embroidery basket from her lap and clasped her hand between his.</t1611><t1612>"I can't bear this wait any longer," he said to her.</t1612><t1613>"We'll get married next month."</t1613><t1614>Amaranta did not tremble at the touch of his icy hands.</t1614><t1615>She withdrew hers, like a slippery little animal, and returned to her work.</t1615>
<t1616>—Don't be naive, Crespi —she smiled—, not even dead would I marry you.</t1616>
<t1617>Pietro Crespi lost control of himself.</t1617> <t1618>He cried shamelessly, almost breaking his fingers in desperation, but he could not break her.</t1618> <t1619>“Don't waste your time,” was all Amaranta said.</t1619> <t1620>“If you really love me that much, don't set foot in this house again.”</t1620> <t1621>Úrsula thought she would go mad with shame.</t1621> <t1622>Pietro Crespi exhausted the resources of supplication.</t1622> <t1623>He reached incredible extremes of humiliation.</t1623> <t1624>He cried all afternoon in Úrsula's lap, who would have sold her soul to console him.</t1624> <t1625>On rainy nights he was seen lurking around the house with a silk umbrella, trying to catch a glimpse of light in Amaranta's bedroom.</t1625> <t1626>He was never better dressed than during that time.</t1626> <t1627>His august head of a tormented emperor acquired a strange air of grandeur.</t1627> <t1628>He pestered Amaranta's friends, those who came to embroider in the corridor, to try to persuade her.</t1628> <t1629>He neglected his business.</t1629> <t1630>He spent the day in the back room, writing insane notes, which he sent to Amaranta with membranes of petals and dried butterflies, and which she returned unopened.</t1630> <t1631>He locked himself up for hours and hours to play the zither.</t1631> <t1632>One night he sang.</t1632> <t1633>Macondo awoke in a kind of stupor, angelized by a zither that did not deserve to be of this world and a voice that one could not conceive there could be another on earth with so much love.</t1633> <t1634>Pietro Crespi then saw the light in all the windows of the town, except in Amaranta's.</t1634> <t1635>On November second, the Day of the Dead, his brother opened the store and found all the lamps lit and all the music boxes open and all the clocks stopped at an endless hour, and in the midst of that crazy concert he found Pietro Crespi in the back room's desk, with his wrists cut by a razor and both hands dipped in a basin of benzoin.</t1635>
<t1636>Úrsula arranged for him to be laid out in the house.</t1636> <t1637>Father Nicanor opposed religious services and burial in sacred ground.</t1637> <t1638>Úrsula confronted him.</t1638> <t1639>"In a way that neither you nor I can understand, that man was a saint," she said.</t1639> <t1640>"So I am going to bury him, against your will, next to Melquíades' grave."</t1640> <t1641>She did so, with the support of the entire town, in magnificent funerals.</t1641> <t1642>Amaranta did not leave the bedroom.</t1642> <t1643>From her bed, she heard Úrsula's weeping, the footsteps and murmurs of the crowd that invaded the house, the wails of the mourners, and then a deep silence smelling of trampled flowers.</t1643> <t1644>For a long time, she continued to feel the lavender breath of Pietro Crespi at dusk, but she had the strength not to succumb to delirium.</t1644> <t1645>Úrsula abandoned her.</t1645> <t1646>She did not even lift her eyes to pity her, the afternoon when Amaranta entered the kitchen and put her hand in the embers of the stove, until it hurt so much that she felt no more pain, only the stench of her own scorched flesh.</t1646> <t1647>It was a donkey's cure for remorse.</t1647> <t1648>For several days she walked around the house with her hand in a bowl of egg whites, and when the burns healed, it seemed as if the egg whites had also healed the ulcers of her heart.</t1648> <t1649>The only external mark the tragedy left on her was the black gauze bandage she wore on her burned hand, which she would wear until her death.</t1649>
<t1650>Arcadio gave a rare display of generosity by proclaiming an official mourning for the death of Pietro Crespi.</t1650> <t1651>Úrsula interpreted it as the return of the lost lamb.</t1651> <t1652>But she was mistaken.</t1652> <t1653>She had lost Arcadio, not since he donned the military uniform, but since always.</t1653> <t1654>She believed she had raised him like a son, as she had raised Rebeca, without privileges or discrimination.</t1654> <t1655>However, Arcadio was a lonely and frightened child during the insomnia plague, amidst Úrsula's utilitarian fever, José Arcadio Buendía's delusions, Aureliano's hermeticism, and the deadly rivalry between Amaranta and Rebeca.</t1655> <t1656>Aureliano taught him to read and write, thinking of something else, as a stranger would have done.</t1656> <t1657>He gave him his clothes, for Visitación to alter, when they were already about to be discarded.</t1657> <t1658>Arcadio suffered with his oversized shoes, his patched pants, and his womanly buttocks.</t1658> <t1659>He never managed to communicate with anyone better than he did with Visitación and Cataure in their language.</t1659> <t1660>Melquíades was the only one who truly cared for him, making him listen to his incomprehensible texts and giving him instructions on the art of daguerreotype.</t1660> <t1661>No one imagined how much he cried in secret over his death, and with what desperation he tried to revive him through the futile study of his papers.</t1661> <t1662>The school, where he was given attention and respect, and later power, with its decisive edicts and his uniform of glory, freed him from the weight of an old bitterness.</t1662> <t1663>One night, in Catarino's store, someone dared to say to him: "You don't deserve the surname you bear."</t1663> <t1664>Contrary to what everyone expected, Arcadio did not have him shot.</t1664>
<t1665>—With great pride —he said—, I am not a Buendía.</t1665>
<t1666>Those who knew the secret of his parentage thought from that reply that he was also aware, but in reality, he never was.</t1666> <t1667>Pilar Ternera, his mother, who had made his blood boil in the daguerreotype room, was for him an obsession as irresistible as she was first for José Arcadio and then for Aureliano.</t1667> <t1668>Despite having lost her charms and the splendor of her laughter, he sought her out and found her in the trail of her smoky scent.</t1668> <t1669>Shortly before the war, one midday when she went later than usual to pick up her youngest son from school, Arcadio was waiting for her in the room where he used to take his siesta, and where he later installed the stocks.</t1669> <t1670>While the child played in the yard, he waited in the hammock, trembling with anxiety, knowing that Pilar Ternera had to pass by there.</t1670> <t1671>She arrived.</t1671> <t1672>Arcadio grabbed her by the wrist and tried to pull her into the hammock.</t1672> <t1673>“I can't, I can't,” said Pilar Ternera, horrified.</t1673> <t1674>“You can't imagine how much I would like to please you, but God is my witness that I can't.”</t1674> <t1675>Arcadio grabbed her by the waist with his tremendous hereditary strength, and felt the world fade away at the touch of her skin.</t1675> <t1676>“Don't play the saint,” he said.</t1676> <t1677>“After all, everyone knows you're a whore.”</t1677> <t1678>Pilar overcame the disgust that her miserable fate inspired in her.</t1678>
<t1679>—The children will notice —he murmured—.</t1679> <t1680>It's better if you leave the door unlatched tonight.</t1680>
<t1681>Arcadio waited for her that night, shivering with fever in the hammock.</t1681><t1682>He waited without sleeping, listening to the restless crickets of the endless dawn and the relentless schedule of the curlews, increasingly convinced that he had been deceived.</t1682><t1683>Suddenly, when his anxiety had turned into rage, the door opened.</t1683><t1684>A few months later, in front of the firing squad, Arcadio would relive the lost steps in the classroom, the stumbles against the benches, and finally the density of a body in the darkness of the room and the beats of the air pumped by a heart that was not his own.</t1684><t1685>He extended his hand and found another hand with two rings on the same finger, which was about to sink into the darkness.</t1685><t1686>He felt the veins' texture, the pulse of his misfortune, and felt the moist palm with the lifeline cut at the base of the thumb by the claw of death.</t1686><t1687>Then he understood that this was not the woman he was waiting for, because she did not smell of smoke but of little flower pomade, and she had inflated and blind breasts with male nipples, and a stone-like and round sex like a nut, and the chaotic tenderness of exalted inexperience.</t1687><t1688>She was a virgin and had the unbelievable name of Santa Sofía de la Piedad.</t1688><t1689>Pilar Ternera had paid her fifty pesos, half of her lifetime savings, to do what she was doing.</t1689><t1690>Arcadio had seen her many times, tending her parents' small grocery store, and had never noticed her, because she had the rare virtue of not fully existing except at the opportune moment.</t1690><t1691>But from that day on, she curled up like a cat in the warmth of his armpit.</t1691><t1692>She would go to the school at siesta time, with her parents' consent, to whom Pilar Ternera had paid the other half of her savings.</t1692><t1693>Later, when the government troops evicted them from the premises, they made love among the tins of lard and sacks of corn in the back room.</t1693><t1694>By the time Arcadio was appointed civil and military chief, they had a daughter.</t1694>
<t1695>The only relatives who found out were José Arcadio and Rebeca, with whom Arcadio maintained intimate relations, based not so much on kinship as on complicity.</t1695> <t1696>José Arcadio had bowed his head to the matrimonial yoke.</t1696> <t1697>Rebeca's firm character, the voracity of her womb, her tenacious ambition, absorbed the husband's colossal energy, who from a lazy womanizer turned into a huge work animal.</t1697> <t1698>They had a clean and orderly house.</t1698> <t1699>Rebeca would open it wide at dawn, and the wind from the graves would enter through the windows and exit through the patio doors, leaving the walls whitewashed and the furniture tanned by the saltpeter of the dead.</t1699> <t1700>The hunger for land, the cloc cloc of her parents' bones, the impatience of her blood in the face of Pietro Crespi's passivity were relegated to the attic of memory.</t1700> <t1701>All day she would embroider by the window, oblivious to the turmoil of the war, until the ceramic pots started to vibrate in the cupboard and she would get up to heat the food, long before the scrawny tracking dogs appeared and then the colossus with gaiters and spurs and a double-barreled shotgun, who sometimes carried a deer on his shoulder and almost always a string of rabbits or wild ducks.</t1701> <t1702>One afternoon, at the beginning of his rule, Arcadio went to visit them unexpectedly.</t1702> <t1703>They hadn't seen him since they left the house, but he was so affectionate and familiar that they invited him to share the stew.</t1703>
<t1704>Only when they were having coffee did Arcadio reveal the reason for his visit: he had received a complaint against José Arcadio.</t1704> <t1705>It was said that he started by plowing his yard and continued straight through the adjoining lands, knocking down fences and destroying ranches with his oxen, until he forcibly took over the best plots in the area.</t1705> <t1706>To the peasants he had not dispossessed, because he was not interested in their lands, he imposed a tax that he collected every Saturday with his hunting dogs and double-barreled shotgun.</t1706> <t1707>He did not deny it.</t1707> <t1708>He based his right on the fact that the usurped lands had been distributed by José Arcadio Buendía at the time of the founding, and he believed it possible to prove that his father had been crazy since then, as he had disposed of an estate that actually belonged to the family.</t1708> <t1709>It was an unnecessary argument because Arcadio had not come to seek justice.</t1709> <t1710>He simply offered to create a property registry office so that José Arcadio could legalize the titles of the usurped land, on the condition that he delegated to the local government the right to collect the taxes.</t1710> <t1711>They came to an agreement.</t1711> <t1712>Years later, when Colonel Aureliano Buendía examined the property titles, he found that all the lands visible from the hill of his yard to the horizon, including the cemetery, were registered in his brother's name, and that in the eleven months of his mandate, Arcadio had taken not only the tax money but also the money he charged the town for the right to bury the dead in José Arcadio's plots.</t1712>
<t1713>Úrsula took several months to learn what was already public knowledge, because people hid it from her to avoid increasing her suffering.</t1713> <t1714>She began to suspect it.</t1714> <t1715>"Arcadio is building a house," she confided to her husband with feigned pride, while trying to put a spoonful of totumo syrup into his mouth.</t1715> <t1716>However, she sighed involuntarily: "I don't know why all this smells bad to me."</t1716> <t1717>Later, when she found out that Arcadio had not only finished the house but had also ordered Viennese furniture, she confirmed her suspicion that he was using public funds.</t1717> <t1718>"You are the shame of our family name," she shouted at him one Sunday after mass, when she saw him in the new house playing cards with his officers.</t1718> <t1719>Arcadio paid no attention to her.</t1719> <t1720>Only then did Úrsula learn that he had a six-month-old daughter, and that Santa Sofía de la Piedad, with whom he was living without being married, was pregnant again.</t1720> <t1721>She resolved to write to Colonel Aureliano Buendía, wherever he might be, to inform him of the situation.</t1721> <t1722>But the events that unfolded in those days not only thwarted her plans but made her regret having conceived them.</t1722> <t1723>The war, which until then had been just a word to designate a vague and remote circumstance, became a dramatic reality.</t1723> <t1724>At the end of February, an elderly woman with an ashen appearance arrived in Macondo, riding a donkey loaded with brooms.</t1724> <t1725>She seemed so harmless that the patrols let her pass without questions, like one of the many vendors who often came from the swamp villages.</t1725> <t1726>She went directly to the barracks.</t1726> <t1727>Arcadio received her in the room that had once been the classroom, which had since been transformed into a sort of rear-guard camp, with hammocks rolled up and hung on the rings, and bedrolls piled in the corners, and rifles and carbines and even hunting shotguns scattered on the floor.</t1727> <t1728>The elderly woman stood at attention in a military salute before identifying herself:</t1728>
<t1729>—I am Colonel Gregorio Stevenson.</t1729>
<t1730>He brought bad news.</t1730> <t1731>The last pockets of liberal resistance, he said, were being exterminated.</t1731> <t1732>Colonel Aureliano Buendía, whom he had left retreating around the Riohacha area, entrusted him with the mission of speaking to Arcadio.</t1732> <t1733>He was to surrender the town without resistance, on the condition that the lives and properties of the liberals would be respected under a word of honor.</t1733> <t1734>Arcadio examined with a look of pity that strange messenger who could have been mistaken for a runaway grandmother.</t1734>
<t1735>—You, of course, bring some written paper —he said.</t1735>
<t1736>—Of course —replied the emissary—, I don't have it with me.</t1736> <t1737>It is easy to understand that under the current circumstances, one does not carry anything compromising.</t1737>
<t1738>While he was speaking, he took out from his bodice and placed on the table a little gold fish.</t1738> <t1739>“I think this will be enough,” he said.</t1739> <t1740>Arcadio verified that it was indeed one of the little fish made by Colonel Aureliano Buendía.</t1740> <t1741>But someone could have bought it before the war, or stolen it, and therefore it had no merit as a safe-conduct.</t1741> <t1742>The messenger went so far as to violate a war secret to prove his identity.</t1742> <t1743>He revealed that he was on a mission to Curaçao, where he hoped to recruit exiles from all over the Caribbean and acquire enough weapons and supplies to attempt a landing by the end of the year.</t1743> <t1744>Trusting in that plan, Colonel Aureliano Buendía was not in favor of making useless sacrifices at that moment.</t1744> <t1745>But Arcadio was inflexible.</t1745> <t1746>He had the messenger imprisoned while verifying his identity, and resolved to defend the place to the death.</t1746>
<t1747>He did not have to wait long.</t1747> <t1748>The news of the liberal failure became increasingly concrete.</t1748> <t1749>At the end of March, in the early hours of a premature rainy morning, the tense calm of the previous weeks was abruptly shattered by a desperate bugle call, followed by a cannon shot that destroyed the temple tower.</t1749> <t1750>In reality, Arcadio's will to resist was madness.</t1750> <t1751>He had no more than fifty poorly armed men, each with a maximum supply of twenty cartridges.</t1751> <t1752>But among them, his former students, excited by high-sounding proclamations, were determined to sacrifice their skins for a lost cause.</t1752> <t1753>Amid the clatter of boots, contradictory orders, cannon shots that made the ground tremble, hasty gunfire, and senseless bugle calls, the supposed Colonel Stevenson managed to speak with Arcadio.</t1753> <t1754>“Spare me the indignity of dying in the stocks with these women's rags,” he said.</t1754> <t1755>“If I am to die, let it be fighting.”</t1755> <t1756>He managed to convince him.</t1756> <t1757>Arcadio ordered that he be given a weapon with twenty cartridges and left him with five men defending the barracks while he went with his staff to lead the resistance.</t1757> <t1758>He did not reach the swamp road.</t1758> <t1759>The barricades had been torn apart and the defenders were fighting in the open in the streets, first as far as their rifle supplies would last, then with pistols against rifles, and finally hand to hand.</t1759> <t1760>Faced with imminent defeat, some women took to the streets armed with sticks and kitchen knives.</t1760> <t1761>In that confusion, Arcadio found Amaranta who was looking for him like a madwoman, in her nightgown, with two old pistols of José Arcadio Buendía.</t1761> <t1762>He gave his rifle to an officer who had been disarmed in the skirmish, and escaped with Amaranta down an adjacent street to take her home.</t1762> <t1763>Úrsula was at the door, waiting, indifferent to the gunfire that had opened a breach in the facade of the neighboring house.</t1763> <t1764>The rain was letting up, but the streets were slippery and soft like melted soap, and distances had to be guessed in the darkness.</t1764> <t1765>Arcadio left Amaranta with Úrsula and tried to confront two soldiers who fired a blind volley from the corner.</t1765> <t1766>The old pistols, stored for many years in a wardrobe, did not work.</t1766> <t1767>Protecting Arcadio with her body, Úrsula tried to drag him to the house.</t1767>
<t1768>—Come on, for God's sake —he shouted at him—.</t1768> <t1769>Enough of this madness!</t1769>
<t1770>The soldiers aimed at them.</t1770>
<t1771>—Let go of that man, ma'am —shouted one of them—, or we won't be responsible for what happens!</t1771>
<t1772>Arcadio pushed Úrsula towards the house and surrendered.</t1772> <t1773>Shortly after, the shooting stopped and the bells began to ring.</t1773> <t1774>The resistance had been annihilated in less than half an hour.</t1774> <t1775>Not a single one of Arcadio's men survived the assault, but before dying they took down three hundred soldiers.</t1775> <t1776>The last stronghold was the barracks.</t1776> <t1777>Before being attacked, the supposed Colonel Gregorio Stevenson set the prisoners free and ordered his men to go out and fight in the street.</t1777> <t1778>The extraordinary mobility and accurate aim with which he fired his twenty cartridges from different windows gave the impression that the barracks was well guarded, and the attackers blew it to pieces with cannon fire.</t1778> <t1779>The captain who led the operation was astonished to find the rubble deserted, and a single man in his underwear, dead, with an unloaded rifle still clutched by an arm that had been torn off.</t1779> <t1780>He had a thick mane of a woman's hair coiled at the nape with a comb, and around his neck a scapular with a little gold fish.</t1780> <t1781>When he turned him over with the tip of his boot to light up his face, the captain was perplexed.</t1781> <t1782>“Shit,” he exclaimed.</t1782> <t1783>Other officers approached.</t1783>
<t1784>—Look where this man turned up —the captain told them—.</t1784> <t1785>It's Gregorio Stevenson.</t1785>
<t1786>At dawn, after a summary court-martial, Arcadio was executed by firing squad against the cemetery wall.</t1786> <t1787>In the last two hours of his life, he could not understand why the fear that had tormented him since childhood had disappeared.</t1787> <t1788>Impassive, without even bothering to demonstrate his newfound courage, he listened to the endless charges of the accusation.</t1788> <t1789>He thought of Úrsula, who at that hour must be under the chestnut tree having coffee with José Arcadio Buendía.</t1789> <t1790>He thought of his eight-month-old daughter, who still did not have a name, and of the one who was to be born in August.</t1790> <t1791>He thought of Santa Sofía de la Piedad, whom he had left the night before salting a deer for Saturday's lunch, and he longed for her hair streaming over her shoulders and her eyelashes that seemed artificial.</t1791> <t1792>He thought of his people without sentimentality, in a severe reckoning with life, beginning to understand how much he really loved the people he had most hated.</t1792> <t1793>The president of the court-martial began his final speech, before Arcadio realized that two hours had passed.</t1793> <t1794>"Although the proven charges may not have had sufficient merit," said the president, "the irresponsible and criminal recklessness with which the accused pushed his subordinates to a useless death would be enough to deserve the death penalty."</t1794> <t1795>In the dilapidated school where he first experienced the security of power, a few meters from the room where he knew the uncertainty of love, Arcadio found the formality of death ridiculous.</t1795> <t1796>In reality, it was not death that mattered to him but life, and that is why the sensation he experienced when the sentence was pronounced was not one of fear but of nostalgia.</t1796> <t1797>He did not speak until he was asked what his last wish was.</t1797>
<t1798>—Tell my wife —he replied with a well-modulated voice— to name the girl Úrsula.</t1798> <t1799>—He paused and confirmed—: Úrsula, like the grandmother.</t1799> <t1800>And also tell her that if the one to be born is a boy, to name him José Arcadio, but not after the uncle, rather after the grandfather.</t1800>
<t1801>Before they took him to the wall, Father Nicanor tried to assist him.</t1801> <t1802>“I have nothing to repent for,” said Arcadio, and he put himself at the orders of the squad after having a cup of black coffee.</t1802> <t1803>The leader of the squad, a specialist in summary executions, had a name that was much more than a coincidence: Captain Roque Carnicero.</t1803> <t1804>On the way to the cemetery, under the persistent drizzle, Arcadio noticed that a radiant Wednesday was dawning on the horizon.</t1804> <t1805>Nostalgia faded with the fog and left in its place an immense curiosity.</t1805> <t1806>Only when he was ordered to turn his back to the wall did Arcadio see Rebeca with wet hair and a dress of pink flowers, opening the house wide open.</t1806> <t1807>He made an effort for her to recognize him.</t1807> <t1808>Indeed, Rebeca casually looked towards the wall and was paralyzed with astonishment, and could barely react to wave goodbye to Arcadio with her hand.</t1808> <t1809>Arcadio responded in the same way.</t1809> <t1810>At that moment, the smoky barrels of the rifles aimed at him, and he heard letter by letter the encyclicals sung by Melquíades, and felt the lost steps of Santa Sofía de la Piedad, virgin, in the classroom, and experienced in his nose the same icy hardness that had caught his attention in the nostrils of Remedios' corpse.</t1810> <t1811>“Ah, damn! —he managed to think—, I forgot to say that if it was a girl, they should name her Remedios.”</t1811> <t1812>Then, accumulated in a tearing claw, he felt again all the terror that had tormented him in life.</t1812> <t1813>The captain gave the order to fire.</t1813> <t1814>Arcadio barely had time to puff out his chest and lift his head, without understanding where the burning liquid that was scorching his thighs was flowing from.</t1814>
<t1815>—Bastards! —he shouted—.</t1815> <t1816>Long live the liberal party!</t1816>
<t1817>The war ended in May.</t1817> <t1818>Two weeks before the government made the official announcement, in a high-sounding proclamation that promised ruthless punishment for the promoters of the rebellion, Colonel Aureliano Buendía was captured when he was about to reach the western border disguised as an indigenous sorcerer.</t1818> <t1819>Of the twenty-one men who followed him to war, fourteen died in combat, six were wounded, and only one accompanied him at the moment of final defeat: Colonel Gerineldo Márquez.</t1819> <t1820>The news of the capture was announced in Macondo with an extraordinary decree.</t1820> <t1821>“He is alive,” Úrsula informed her husband.</t1821> <t1822>“Let us pray to God that his enemies have mercy.”</t1822> <t1823>After three days of weeping, one afternoon while she was stirring a milk candy in the kitchen, she clearly heard her son's voice very close to her ear.</t1823> <t1824>“It was Aureliano,” she shouted, running towards the chestnut tree to give the news to her husband.</t1824> <t1825>“I don't know how the miracle happened, but he is alive and we will see him very soon.”</t1825> <t1826>She took it for granted.</t1826> <t1827>She had the floors of the house washed and the furniture rearranged.</t1827> <t1828>A few weeks later, a rumor without origin that would not be supported by the decree dramatically confirmed the omen.</t1828> <t1829>Colonel Aureliano Buendía had been sentenced to death, and the sentence would be carried out in Macondo, as a warning to the population.</t1829>
<t1830>One Monday, at twenty past ten in the morning, Amaranta was dressing Aureliano José when she perceived a distant commotion and a trumpet call, a second before Úrsula burst into the room with a shout: "They're bringing him."</t1830> <t1831>The troops struggled to subdue the overflowing crowd with rifle butts.</t1831> <t1832>Úrsula and Amaranta ran to the corner, pushing their way through, and then they saw him.</t1832> <t1833>He looked like a beggar.</t1833> <t1834>His clothes were torn, his hair and beard tangled, and he was barefoot.</t1834> <t1835>He walked without feeling the scorching dust, his hands tied behind his back with a rope held by a mounted officer.</t1835> <t1836>Next to him, equally shabby and defeated, they were bringing Colonel Gerineldo Márquez.</t1836> <t1837>They were not sad.</t1837> <t1838>They seemed rather disturbed by the crowd that shouted all kinds of insults at the troops.</t1838>
<t1839>—My son! —shouted Úrsula amidst the commotion, and she slapped the soldier who tried to stop her.</t1839> <t1840>The officer's horse reared up.</t1840> <t1841>Then Colonel Aureliano Buendía stopped, trembling, dodged his mother's arms, and fixed a hard gaze on her eyes.</t1841>
<t1842>—Go home, mom —he said—.</t1842> <t1843>Ask the authorities for permission and come see me in jail.</t1843>
<t1844>He looked at Amaranta, who remained undecided two steps behind Úrsula, and smiled as he asked her: "What happened to your hand?".</t1844> <t1845>Amaranta raised her hand with the black bandage.</t1845> <t1846>"A burn," she said, and moved Úrsula aside so she wouldn't be trampled by the horses.</t1846> <t1847>The troop fired.</t1847> <t1848>A special guard surrounded the prisoners and trotted them to the barracks.</t1848>
<t1849>In the evening, Úrsula visited Colonel Aureliano Buendía in jail.</t1849> <t1850>She had tried to obtain permission through Don Apolinar Moscote, but he had lost all authority in the face of the omnipotence of the military.</t1850> <t1851>Father Nicanor was bedridden with a hepatic fever.</t1851> <t1852>The parents of Colonel Gerineldo Márquez, who was not condemned to death, had tried to see him and were turned away with rifle butts.</t1852> <t1853>Faced with the impossibility of finding intermediaries, convinced that her son would be executed at dawn, Úrsula made a bundle with the things she wanted to take him and went alone to the barracks.</t1853>
<t1854>—I am the mother of Colonel Aureliano Buendía —she announced.</t1854>
<t1855>The sentinels blocked her way.</t1855> <t1856>“I’m going in anyway,” Úrsula warned them.</t1856> <t1857>“So if you have orders to shoot, start right now.”</t1857> <t1858>She pushed one aside and entered the old classroom, where a group of naked soldiers were greasing their weapons.</t1858> <t1859>An officer in campaign uniform, rosy-cheeked, with very thick glasses and ceremonious gestures, signaled the sentinels to withdraw.</t1859>
<t1860>—I am the mother of Colonel Aureliano Buendía —Úrsula repeated.</t1860>
<t1861>—You mean to say —corrected the officer with a kind smile— that she is the mother of Mr. Aureliano Buendía.</t1861>
<t1862>Úrsula recognized in his affected way of speaking the languid cadence of the people from the highlands, the cachacos.</t1862>
<t1863>—As you say, sir —he admitted—, as long as you allow me to see it.</t1863>
<t1864>There were higher orders not to allow visits to those condemned to death, but the officer took responsibility for granting a fifteen-minute interview.</t1864> <t1865>Úrsula showed him what she carried in the bundle: a change of clean clothes, the boots her son wore for the wedding, and the dulce de leche she had saved for him since the day she sensed his return.</t1865> <t1866>She found Colonel Aureliano Buendía in the stocks room, lying on a cot with his arms open, because his armpits were studded with boils.</t1866> <t1867>They had allowed him to shave.</t1867> <t1868>The dense mustache with twisted ends accentuated the angularity of his cheekbones.</t1868> <t1869>To Úrsula, he seemed paler than when he left, a bit taller, and more solitary than ever.</t1869> <t1870>He was aware of the details of the house: Pietro Crespi's suicide, the arbitrariness and execution of Arcadio, José Arcadio Buendía's impassiveness under the chestnut tree.</t1870> <t1871>He knew that Amaranta had dedicated her virgin widowhood to raising Aureliano José, and that he was beginning to show very good judgment and could read and write at the same time he was learning to speak.</t1871> <t1872>From the moment she entered the room, Úrsula felt intimidated by her son's maturity, by his aura of dominance, by the glow of authority that radiated from his skin.</t1872> <t1873>She was surprised that he was so well-informed. "You know I'm a fortune teller," he joked.</t1873> <t1874>And he added seriously: "This morning, when they brought me, I had the impression that I had already gone through all this."</t1874> <t1875>In truth, while the crowd thundered as he passed, he was lost in his thoughts, amazed at how the town had aged in a year.</t1875> <t1876>The almond trees had broken leaves.</t1876> <t1877>The houses painted blue, then painted red, and then painted blue again, had ended up acquiring an indefinable color.</t1877>
<t1878>—What did you expect? —sighed Úrsula—.</t1878> <t1879>Time passes.</t1879>
<t1880>—That's right —admitted Aureliano—, but not so much.</t1880>
<t1881>In this way, the long-awaited visit, for which both had prepared questions and even anticipated the answers, turned out to be the same everyday conversation as always.</t1881> <t1882>When the sentinel announced the end of the interview, Aureliano pulled a roll of sweaty papers from under the mat of the cot.</t1882> <t1883>They were his verses.</t1883> <t1884>The ones inspired by Remedios, which he had taken with him when he left, and the ones written afterwards, in the hazardous pauses of the war.</t1884> <t1885>“Promise me that no one will read them,” he said.</t1885> <t1886>“Tonight, burn them in the oven.”</t1886> <t1887>Úrsula promised and stood up to give him a farewell kiss.</t1887>
<t1888>—I brought you a revolver —he murmured.</t1888>
<t1889>Colonel Aureliano Buendía confirmed that the sentry was not in sight.</t1889> <t1890>“It's no use to me,” he replied in a low voice.</t1890> <t1891>“But give it to me, just in case they search you on the way out.”</t1891> <t1892>Úrsula took the revolver out of her bodice and he placed it under the cot's mat.</t1892> <t1893>“And now, don't say goodbye,” he concluded with calm emphasis.</t1893> <t1894>“Don't beg anyone or lower yourself before anyone.</t1894> <t1895>Consider that I was executed a long time ago.”</t1895> <t1896>Úrsula bit her lips to keep from crying.</t1896>
<t1897>—Put hot stones on the boils —he said.</t1897>
<t1898>He turned around and left the room.</t1898> <t1899>Colonel Aureliano Buendía remained standing, thoughtful, until the door closed.</t1899> <t1900>Then he lay back down with his arms spread out.</t1900> <t1901>Since the beginning of adolescence, when he began to be aware of his premonitions, he thought that death had to announce itself with a definite, unequivocal, irrevocable sign, but he was only a few hours away from dying, and the sign had not come.</t1901> <t1902>On one occasion, a very beautiful woman entered his camp in Tucurinca and asked the sentries to let her see him.</t1902> <t1903>They let her pass because they knew the fanaticism of some mothers who sent their daughters to the bedrooms of the most notable warriors, as they themselves said, to improve the race.</t1903> <t1904>Colonel Aureliano Buendía was that night finishing the poem of the man who had gotten lost in the rain when the girl entered the room.</t1904> <t1905>He turned his back to her to put the sheet in the locked drawer where he kept his verses.</t1905> <t1906>And then he felt it.</t1906> <t1907>He grabbed the pistol in the drawer without turning his face.</t1907>
<t1908>—Don't despair, please —he said.</t1908>
<t1909>When he turned with the gun cocked, the girl had lowered hers and didn't know what to do.</t1909> <t1910>That was how he had managed to evade four out of eleven ambushes.</t1910> <t1911>In contrast, someone who was never captured entered the revolutionary barracks of Manaure one night and stabbed to death his close friend, Colonel Magnífico Visbal, to whom he had given up his cot so he could sweat out a fever.</t1911> <t1912>A few meters away, sleeping in a hammock in the same room, he didn't notice anything.</t1912> <t1913>His efforts to systematize the omens were futile.</t1913> <t1914>They appeared suddenly, in a burst of supernatural lucidity, like an absolute and momentary conviction, but elusive.</t1914> <t1915>Sometimes they were so natural that he didn't identify them as omens until they came true.</t1915> <t1916>Other times they were definitive and didn't come true.</t1916> <t1917>Often they were nothing more than vulgar strokes of superstition.</t1917> <t1918>But when he was condemned to death and asked to express his last wish, he had no difficulty identifying the omen that inspired his response:</t1918>
<t1919>—I request that the sentence be carried out in Macondo —he said.</t1919>
<t1920>The president of the court became upset.</t1920>
<t1921>—Don't be clever, Buendía —he said to him—.</t1921> <t1922>It's a stratagem to buy time.</t1922>
<t1923>—If you don't fulfill it, that's your problem —said the colonel—, but that is my last will.</t1923>
<t1924>Since then, the omens had abandoned him.</t1924> <t1925>The day Úrsula visited him in jail, after much thought, he concluded that perhaps death would not announce itself that time, because it did not depend on chance but on the will of his executioners.</t1925> <t1926>He spent the night awake, tormented by the pain of the boils.</t1926> <t1927>Shortly before dawn, he heard footsteps in the corridor.</t1927> <t1928>“They are coming,” he said to himself, and thought without reason of José Arcadio Buendía, who at that moment was thinking of him, under the gloomy dawn of the chestnut tree.</t1928> <t1929>He did not feel fear, nor nostalgia, but an intestinal rage at the idea that this artificial death would not allow him to know the end of so many things he left unfinished.</t1929> <t1930>The door opened and the guard came in with a bowl of coffee.</t1930> <t1931>The next day at the same hour, he was still as he had been, raging with the pain in his armpits, and exactly the same thing happened.</t1931> <t1932>On Thursday, he shared the dulce de leche with the guards and put on the clean clothes, which were tight on him, and the patent leather boots.</t1932> <t1933>Even on Friday, he had not yet been executed.</t1933>
<t1934>In reality, they did not dare to carry out the sentence.</t1934> <t1935>The rebellion of the people made the military think that the execution of Colonel Aureliano Buendía would have serious political consequences not only in Macondo but throughout the entire swamp region, so they consulted the authorities of the provincial capital.</t1935> <t1936>On Saturday night, while they awaited the response, Captain Roque Carnicero went with other officers to Catarino's store.</t1936> <t1937>Only one woman, almost pressured with threats, dared to take him to the room.</t1937> <t1938>“They don't want to sleep with a man they know is going to die,” she confessed to him.</t1938> <t1939>“No one knows how it will happen, but everyone is saying that the officer who executes Colonel Aureliano Buendía, and all the soldiers in the squad, one by one, will be killed without fail, sooner or later, even if they hide at the end of the world.”</t1939> <t1940>Captain Roque Carnicero discussed it with the other officers, and they discussed it with their superiors.</t1940> <t1941>On Sunday, although no one had revealed it frankly, although no military act had disturbed the tense calm of those days, the whole town knew that the officers were willing to avoid the responsibility of the execution with all kinds of excuses.</t1941> <t1942>On Monday's mail came the official order: the execution had to be carried out within twenty-four hours.</t1942> <t1943>That night the officers put seven slips of paper with their names into a cap, and the unmerciful fate of Captain Roque Carnicero marked him with the winning slip.</t1943> <t1944>“Bad luck has no loopholes,” he said with deep bitterness.</t1944> <t1945>“I was born a son of a bitch and I will die a son of a bitch.”</t1945> <t1946>At five in the morning he chose the squad by lot, formed them in the courtyard, and woke the condemned man with a premonitory phrase:</t1946>
<t1947>—Let's go, Buendía —he said to him—.</t1947> <t1948>Our time has come.</t1948>
<t1949>—So this was it —replied the colonel—.</t1949> <t1950>I was dreaming that my boils had burst.</t1950>
<t1951>Rebeca Buendía would get up at three in the morning ever since she learned that Aureliano would be executed.</t1951> <t1952>She would stay in the dark bedroom, watching the cemetery wall through the half-open window, while the bed she was sitting on shook with José Arcadio's snores.</t1952> <t1953>She waited all week with the same hidden obstinacy with which she once waited for Pietro Crespi's letters.</t1953> <t1954>"They won't execute him here," José Arcadio would tell her.</t1954> <t1955>"They'll execute him at midnight in the barracks so that no one knows who formed the firing squad, and they'll bury him right there."</t1955> <t1956>Rebeca kept waiting.</t1956> <t1957>"They're so stupid that they'll execute him here," she would say.</t1957> <t1958>She was so sure that she had planned the way she would open the door to wave goodbye.</t1958> <t1959>"They won't bring him through the street," José Arcadio insisted, "with only six scared soldiers, knowing that people are ready for anything."</t1959> <t1960>Indifferent to her husband's logic, Rebeca continued at the window.</t1960>
<t1961>—You'll see that they are that dumb —he said.</t1961>
<t1962>On Tuesday at five in the morning, José Arcadio had taken his coffee and let the dogs out when Rebeca closed the window and grabbed the headboard of the bed to keep from falling.</t1962> <t1963>“Here he comes,” she sighed.</t1963> <t1964>“How beautiful he is.”</t1964> <t1965>José Arcadio looked out the window and saw him, trembling in the dawn light, wearing pants that had been his in his youth.</t1965> <t1966>He was already with his back to the wall and had his hands on his waist because the burning knots in his armpits prevented him from lowering his arms.</t1966> <t1967>“So much suffering,” murmured Colonel Aureliano Buendía.</t1967> <t1968>“So much suffering for six faggots to kill you without being able to do anything.”</t1968> <t1969>He repeated it with such rage that it almost seemed like fervor, and Captain Roque Carnicero was moved because he thought he was praying.</t1969> <t1970>When the squad aimed at him, the rage had materialized into a viscous and bitter substance that numbed his tongue and forced him to close his eyes.</t1970> <t1971>Then the aluminum glow of dawn disappeared, and he saw himself again, very young, in short pants and a bow around his neck, and saw his father on a splendid afternoon leading him inside the tent, and he saw the ice.</t1971> <t1972>When he heard the shout, he thought it was the squad's final order.</t1972> <t1973>He opened his eyes with a chilling curiosity, expecting to see the incandescent trajectory of the bullets, but he only found Captain Roque Carnicero with his arms raised, and José Arcadio crossing the street with his dreadful shotgun ready to fire.</t1973>
<t1974>—Don't shoot —the captain said to José Arcadio—.</t1974> <t1975>You are sent by Divine Providence.</t1975>
<t1976>There another war began.</t1976> <t1977>Captain Roque Carnicero and his six men went with Colonel Aureliano Buendía to liberate the revolutionary general Victorio Medina, sentenced to death in Riohacha.</t1977> <t1978>They thought they could save time by crossing the mountains via the route José Arcadio Buendía had taken to found Macondo, but within a week they were convinced it was an impossible endeavor.</t1978> <t1979>So they had to take the dangerous foothill route, with no more ammunition than that of the firing squad.</t1979> <t1980>They camped near the towns, and one of them, with a little gold fish in hand, would enter in disguise in broad daylight and make contact with the resting liberals, who the next morning would go out hunting and never return.</t1980> <t1981>When they sighted Riohacha from a bend in the mountains, General Victorio Medina had already been executed.</t1981> <t1982>Colonel Aureliano Buendía's men proclaimed him the leader of the revolutionary forces of the Caribbean coast, with the rank of general.</t1982> <t1983>He assumed the position but rejected the promotion, imposing on himself the condition not to accept it until the conservative regime was overthrown.</t1983> <t1984>Within three months they had managed to arm more than a thousand men, but they were exterminated.</t1984> <t1985>The survivors reached the eastern border.</t1985> <t1986>The next time they were heard from, they had landed at Cabo de la Vela, coming from the Antilles archipelago, and a government report, broadcast by telegraph and published in jubilant proclamations throughout the country, announced the death of Colonel Aureliano Buendía.</t1986> <t1987>But two days later, a multiple telegram, which almost caught up with the previous one, announced another rebellion in the southern plains.</t1987> <t1988>Thus began the legend of the ubiquity of Colonel Aureliano Buendía.</t1988> <t1989>Simultaneous and contradictory reports declared him victorious in Villanueva, defeated in Guacamayal, devoured by the Motilone Indians, dead in a village in the swamp, and once again uprising in Urumita.</t1989> <t1990>The liberal leaders, who at that time were negotiating a participation in parliament, labeled him an adventurer without party representation.</t1990> <t1991>The national government classified him as a bandit and put a price of five thousand pesos on his head.</t1991> <t1992>After sixteen defeats, Colonel Aureliano Buendía left La Guajira with two thousand well-armed indigenous people, and the garrison, surprised during their sleep, abandoned Riohacha.</t1992> <t1993>There he established his headquarters and declared total war against the regime.</t1993> <t1994>The first notification he received from the government was the threat to execute Colonel Gerineldo Márquez within forty-eight hours if he did not retreat with his forces to the eastern border.</t1994> <t1995>Colonel Roque Carnicero, who was then his chief of staff, handed him the telegram with a gesture of consternation, but he read it with unpredictable joy.</t1995>
<t1996>—How wonderful! —he exclaimed—.</t1996> <t1997>We now have a telegraph in Macondo.</t1997>
<t1998>His response was definitive.</t1998> <t1999>In three months, he expected to establish his headquarters in Macondo.</t1999> <t2000>If by then he did not find Colonel Gerineldo Márquez alive, he would summarily execute all the officers he had imprisoned at that moment, starting with the generals, and would issue orders to his subordinates to proceed in the same manner until the end of the war.</t2000> <t2001>Three months later, when he entered Macondo victorious, the first embrace he received on the swamp road was from Colonel Gerineldo Márquez.</t2001>
<t2002>The house was full of children.</t2002> <t2003>Úrsula had taken in Santa Sofía de la Piedad, along with her eldest daughter and a pair of twins who were born five months after Arcadio's execution.</t2003> <t2004>Against the last will of the executed man, she baptized the girl with the name Remedios.</t2004> <t2005>«I am sure that this is what Arcadio meant to say», she argued.</t2005> <t2006>«We will not name her Úrsula, because one suffers a lot with that name».</t2006> <t2007>She named the twins José Arcadio Segundo and Aureliano Segundo.</t2007> <t2008>Amaranta took care of all of them.</t2008> <t2009>She placed small wooden seats in the living room and established a nursery with other children from neighboring families.</t2009> <t2010>When Colonel Aureliano Buendía returned, amidst the explosions of fireworks and the ringing of bells, a children's choir welcomed him at the house.</t2010> <t2011>Aureliano José, tall like his grandfather, dressed as a revolutionary officer, gave him military honors.</t2011>
<t2012>Not all the news was good.</t2012><t2013>A year after Colonel Aureliano Buendía's escape, José Arcadio and Rebeca went to live in the house built by Arcadio.</t2013><t2014>Nobody found out about his intervention to prevent the execution.</t2014><t2015>In the new house, located in the best corner of the square, in the shade of a privileged almond tree with three robin nests, with a large door for visitors and four windows for light, they established a hospitable home.</t2015><t2016>Rebeca's old friends, among them four Moscote sisters who remained single, resumed the embroidery sessions interrupted years before in the begonia corridor.</t2016><t2017>José Arcadio continued to enjoy the usurped lands, whose titles were recognized by the conservative government.</t2017><t2018>Every afternoon he was seen returning on horseback, with his hunting dogs and his double-barreled shotgun, and a string of rabbits hanging on the saddle.</t2018><t2019>One September afternoon, under the threat of a storm, he returned home earlier than usual.</t2019><t2020>He greeted Rebeca in the dining room, tied the dogs in the yard, hung the rabbits in the kitchen to salt them later, and went to the bedroom to change clothes.</t2020><t2021>Rebeca later declared that when her husband entered the bedroom, she locked herself in the bathroom and didn't notice anything.</t2021><t2022>It was a hard-to-believe version, but there was no more plausible one, and no one could conceive of a motive for Rebeca to murder the man who had made her happy.</t2022><t2023>That was perhaps the only mystery that was never solved in Macondo.</t2023><t2024>As soon as José Arcadio closed the bedroom door, the blast of a gunshot echoed through the house.</t2024><t2025>A thread of blood came out from under the door, crossed the living room, went out to the street, followed a direct course along the uneven sidewalks, descended steps and climbed curbs, passed by the Street of the Turks, turned a corner to the right and another to the left, turned at a right angle in front of the Buendía house, passed under the closed door, crossed the living room sticking to the walls to avoid staining the tapestries, continued through the other room, avoided the dining table in a wide curve, advanced through the begonia corridor and passed unseen under Amaranta's chair who was giving an arithmetic lesson to Aureliano José, and entered the pantry and appeared in the kitchen where Úrsula was about to crack thirty-six eggs for the bread.</t2025>
<t2026>—Hail Mary Most Pure! —shouted Úrsula.</t2026>
<t2027>He followed the trail of blood in the opposite direction, and in search of its origin, he crossed the barn, passed through the corridor of begonias where Aureliano José was singing that three and three are six and six and three are nine, and crossed the dining room and the rooms and continued in a straight line down the street, then turned right and then left until he reached the Street of the Turks, not remembering that he was still wearing his baking apron and house slippers, and went out to the square and entered a house where he had never been before, and pushed open the door of the bedroom and almost choked on the smell of burnt gunpowder, and found José Arcadio lying face down on the floor over the gaiters he had just taken off, and saw the original end of the blood trail that had stopped flowing from his right ear.</t2027> <t2028>They found no wound on his body nor could they locate the weapon.</t2028> <t2029>Nor was it possible to remove the penetrating smell of gunpowder from the corpse.</t2029> <t2030>First, they washed him three times with soap and a scrubbing brush, then they rubbed him with salt and vinegar, then with ash and lemon, and finally they put him in a barrel of lye and let him soak for six hours.</t2030> <t2031>They scrubbed him so much that the arabesques of the tattoo began to fade.</t2031> <t2032>When they conceived the desperate measure of seasoning him with pepper and cumin and bay leaves and boiling him for an entire day over a slow fire, he had already begun to decompose and they had to bury him in a hurry.</t2032> <t2033>They sealed him hermetically in a special coffin two meters and thirty centimeters long and one meter and ten centimeters wide, reinforced inside with iron plates and screwed with steel bolts, and even so, the smell was noticeable on the streets through which the funeral procession passed.</t2033> <t2034>Father Nicanor, with his liver swollen and tense like a drum, blessed him from his bed.</t2034> <t2035>Although in the following months they reinforced the tomb with superimposed walls and filled the gaps with compacted ash, sawdust, and quicklime, the cemetery continued to smell of gunpowder for many years, until the engineers of the banana company covered the grave with a concrete shell.</t2035> <t2036>As soon as they removed the corpse, Rebeca closed the doors of her house and buried herself alive, covered with a thick crust of disdain that no earthly temptation could break.</t2036> <t2037>She went out into the street on one occasion, very old, with shoes the color of antique silver and a hat with tiny flowers, around the time when the Wandering Jew passed through the town and caused such intense heat that birds broke through the window screens to die in the bedrooms.</t2037> <t2038>The last time anyone saw her alive was when she killed a thief with a precise shot as he tried to force the door of her house.</t2038> <t2039>Except for Argénida, her maid and confidante, no one had contact with her since then.</t2039> <t2040>At one time, it was known that she wrote letters to the bishop, whom she considered her first cousin, but it was never said that she received a reply.</t2040> <t2041>The town forgot her.</t2041>
<t2042>Despite his triumphant return, Colonel Aureliano Buendía was not enthusiastic about appearances.</t2042> <t2043>The government troops abandoned the plazas without resistance, and this created an illusion of victory among the liberal population that was not convenient to dispel, but the revolutionaries knew the truth, and more than anyone, Colonel Aureliano Buendía.</t2043> <t2044>Although at that moment he had more than five thousand men under his command and dominated two coastal states, he was aware of being cornered against the sea, and caught in such a confusing political situation that when he ordered the restoration of the church tower shattered by an army cannon shot, Father Nicanor commented from his sickbed: "This is nonsense: the defenders of the faith of Christ destroy the temple and the Masons order it to be repaired."</t2044> <t2045>Seeking an escape route, he spent hours and hours in the telegraph office, conferencing with the leaders of other plazas, and each time he came out with the more defined impression that the war was stagnant.</t2045> <t2046>When news of new liberal triumphs was received, they were proclaimed with jubilant decrees, but he measured their true extent on the maps, and understood that his forces were penetrating the jungle, defending themselves from malaria and mosquitoes, advancing in the opposite direction to reality.</t2046> <t2047>"We are wasting time," he complained to his officers.</t2047> <t2048>"We will be wasting time as long as the bastards of the party are begging for a seat in congress."</t2048> <t2049>On sleepless nights, lying on his back in the hammock that hung in the same room where he had been condemned to death, he evoked the image of the lawyers dressed in black who left the presidential palace in the icy early morning with their coat collars turned up to their ears, rubbing their hands, whispering, taking refuge in the gloomy cafes of dawn, to speculate on what the president meant when he said yes, or what he meant when he said no, and even to suppose what the president was thinking when he said something entirely different, while he swatted mosquitoes at thirty-five degrees of temperature, feeling the dreadful dawn approaching when he would have to give his men the order to throw themselves into the sea.</t2049>
<t2050>One night of uncertainty when Pilar Ternera was singing in the courtyard with the troop, he asked her to read his future in the cards.</t2050> <t2051>"Take care of your mouth," was all that Pilar Ternera could make out after spreading and gathering the cards three times.</t2051> <t2052>"I don't know what it means, but the sign is very clear: take care of your mouth."</t2052> <t2053>Two days later, someone gave an orderly a bowl of coffee without sugar, and the orderly passed it to another, and this one to another, until it went from hand to hand to Colonel Aureliano Buendía's office.</t2053> <t2054>He hadn't asked for coffee, but since it was there, the colonel drank it.</t2054> <t2055>It had enough nux vomica to kill a horse.</t2055> <t2056>When they took him home, he was stiff and arched, and his tongue was split between his teeth.</t2056> <t2057>Úrsula wrestled him from death.</t2057> <t2058>After cleaning his stomach with emetics, she wrapped him in warm blankets and gave him egg whites for two days, until his ravaged body regained its normal temperature.</t2058> <t2059>On the fourth day, he was out of danger.</t2059> <t2060>Against his will, pressured by Úrsula and the officers, he stayed in bed for another week.</t2060> <t2061>Only then did he learn that his verses had not been burned.</t2061> <t2062>"I didn't want to rush," Úrsula explained to him.</t2062> <t2063>"That night, when I was about to light the oven, I told myself it was better to wait until they brought the corpse."</t2063> <t2064>In the haze of convalescence, surrounded by Remedios's dusty dolls, Colonel Aureliano Buendía evoked in the reading of his verses the decisive moments of his existence.</t2064> <t2065>He began to write again.</t2065> <t2066>For many hours, apart from the shocks of a war without a future, he resolved his experiences on the brink of death into rhymed verses.</t2066> <t2067>Then his thoughts became so clear that he could examine them inside out.</t2067> <t2068>One night he asked Colonel Gerineldo Márquez:</t2068>
<t2069>—Tell me something, buddy: why are you fighting?</t2069>
<t2070>—Why should it be, compadre —answered Colonel Gerineldo Márquez—: for the great Liberal Party.</t2070>
<t2071>—Lucky you who knows it —he replied—.</t2071> <t2072>As for me, I am just now realizing that I am fighting out of pride.</t2072>
<t2073>—That is bad —said Colonel Gerineldo Márquez.</t2073>
<t2074>Colonel Aureliano Buendía was amused by his alarm.</t2074> <t2075>"Naturally," he said.</t2075> <t2076>"But in any case, it's better than not knowing why one fights."</t2076> <t2077>He looked him in the eyes and added, smiling:</t2077>
<t2078>—What is it to fight like you for something that means nothing to anyone.</t2078>
<t2079>His pride had prevented him from making contact with the armed groups in the interior of the country, as long as the party leaders did not publicly retract their statement that he was a bandit.</t2079> <t2080>He knew, however, that as soon as he set aside those scruples, he would break the vicious circle of war.</t2080> <t2081>Convalescence allowed him to reflect.</t2081> <t2082>Then he managed to get Úrsula to give him the rest of the buried inheritance and her substantial savings; he appointed Colonel Gerineldo Márquez as the civil and military chief of Macondo, and went to establish contact with the rebel groups in the interior.</t2082>
<t2083>Colonel Gerineldo Márquez was not only Colonel Aureliano Buendía's most trusted man, but Úrsula also received him as a member of the family.</t2083> <t2084>Fragile, timid, with a natural good education, he was nevertheless better suited for war than for governance.</t2084> <t2085>His political advisors easily entangled him in theoretical labyrinths.</t2085> <t2086>But he managed to impose in Macondo the rural peace environment that Colonel Aureliano Buendía dreamed of to die old making little gold fishes.</t2086> <t2087>Although he lived in his parents' house, he had lunch at Úrsula's two or three times a week.</t2087> <t2088>He initiated Aureliano José in the handling of firearms, gave him premature military instruction, and for several months took him to live in the barracks, with Úrsula's consent, so that he would become a man.</t2088> <t2089>Many years before, almost a child, Gerineldo Márquez had declared his love to Amaranta.</t2089> <t2090>She was then so infatuated with her solitary passion for Pietro Crespi that she laughed at him.</t2090> <t2091>Gerineldo Márquez waited.</t2091> <t2092>On one occasion, he sent Amaranta a note from jail, asking her the favor of embroidering a dozen batiste handkerchiefs with his father's initials.</t2092> <t2093>He sent her the money.</t2093> <t2094>A week later, Amaranta brought him the dozen embroidered handkerchiefs to the jail, along with the money, and they spent several hours talking about the past.</t2094> <t2095>“When I get out of here, I will marry you,” Gerineldo Márquez said to her as he bid farewell.</t2095> <t2096>Amaranta laughed, but she continued thinking about him while teaching the children to read, and wished to revive for him her youthful passion for Pietro Crespi.</t2096> <t2097>On Saturdays, the day for visiting prisoners, she would stop by Gerineldo Márquez’s parents' house and accompany them to the jail.</t2097> <t2098>One of those Saturdays, Úrsula was surprised to see her in the kitchen, waiting for the biscuits to come out of the oven so she could choose the best ones and wrap them in a napkin she had embroidered for the occasion.</t2098>
<t2099>—Marry him —he said to her—.</t2099> <t2100>You'll hardly find another man like him.</t2100>
<t2101>Amaranta pretended a reaction of disgust.</t2101>
<t2102>—I don't need to go around hunting men —she replied—.</t2102> <t2103>I'm taking these biscuits to Gerineldo because I feel sorry for him; sooner or later they're going to shoot him.</t2103>
<t2104>He said it without thinking, but it was around that time that the government made public the threat to execute Colonel Gerineldo Márquez if the rebel forces did not surrender Riohacha.</t2104> <t2105>The visits were suspended.</t2105> <t2106>Amaranta locked herself up to cry, overwhelmed by a feeling of guilt similar to the one that tormented her when Remedios died, as if once again her thoughtless words were responsible for a death.</t2106> <t2107>Her mother consoled her.</t2107> <t2108>She assured her that Colonel Aureliano Buendía would do something to prevent the execution, and promised that she herself would take care of attracting Gerineldo Márquez, once the war was over.</t2108> <t2109>She fulfilled the promise before the expected time.</t2109> <t2110>When Gerineldo Márquez returned to the house invested with his new dignity as civil and military chief, she received him like a son, conceived exquisite flattery to retain him, and prayed with all her heart that he would remember his intention to marry Amaranta.</t2110> <t2111>Her pleas seemed certain.</t2111> <t2112>The days when he went to have lunch at the house, Colonel Gerineldo Márquez would stay the afternoon in the begonia corridor playing Chinese checkers with Amaranta.</t2112> <t2113>Úrsula would bring them coffee with milk and biscuits and take care of the children so they wouldn't be disturbed.</t2113> <t2114>Amaranta, in reality, made an effort to rekindle in her heart the forgotten ashes of her youthful passion.</t2114> <t2115>With an anxiety that became intolerable, she awaited the lunch days, the afternoons of Chinese checkers, and time flew by in the company of that warrior with a nostalgic name whose fingers trembled imperceptibly when moving the pieces.</t2115> <t2116>But the day Colonel Gerineldo Márquez reiterated his intention to marry her, she rejected him.</t2116>
<t2117>—I will not marry anyone —she told him—, but least of all you.</t2117> <t2118>You love Aureliano so much that you are going to marry me because you cannot marry him.</t2118>
<t2119>Colonel Gerineldo Márquez was a patient man.</t2119> <t2120>“I will insist again,” he said.</t2120> <t2121>“Sooner or later I will convince you.”</t2121> <t2122>He continued visiting the house.</t2122> <t2123>Locked in the bedroom, biting back secret tears, Amaranta put her fingers in her ears to avoid hearing the voice of the suitor who was telling Úrsula the latest news of the war, and despite dying to see him, she found the strength not to go out to meet him.</t2123>
<t2124>Colonel Aureliano Buendía then had time to send a detailed report to Macondo every two weeks.</t2124><t2125>But only once, almost eight months after he had left, did he write to Úrsula.</t2125><t2126>A special emissary brought a sealed envelope to the house, inside of which was a paper written in the colonel's meticulous handwriting: Take good care of father because he is going to die.</t2126><t2127>Úrsula was alarmed.</t2127><t2128>"If Aureliano says so, Aureliano knows," she said.</t2128><t2129>And she asked for help to take José Arcadio Buendía to his bedroom.</t2129><t2130>Not only was he as heavy as ever, but during his prolonged stay under the chestnut tree, he had developed the ability to increase his weight voluntarily, to the point that seven men could not lift him and had to drag him to the bed.</t2130><t2131>A stench of tender mushrooms, wood flower, and ancient, concentrated exposure to the elements filled the air of the bedroom when the colossal old man, macerated by the sun and rain, began to breathe it.</t2131><t2132>The next day he was not in bed at dawn.</t2132><t2133>After searching all the rooms, Úrsula found him again under the chestnut tree.</t2133><t2134>Then they tied him to the bed.</t2134><t2135>Despite his intact strength, José Arcadio Buendía was not in a condition to fight.</t2135><t2136>Everything was the same to him.</t2136><t2137>If he returned to the chestnut tree, it was not by his will but by a habit of the body.</t2137><t2138>Úrsula took care of him, fed him, and brought him news of Aureliano.</t2138><t2139>But in reality, the only person he could have contact with for a long time was Prudencio Aguilar.</t2139><t2140>Almost pulverized by the profound decrepitude of death, Prudencio Aguilar went twice a day to talk with him.</t2140><t2141>They talked about roosters.</t2141><t2142>They promised to establish a breeding farm of magnificent animals, not so much to enjoy victories that they would no longer need, but to have something to distract themselves with on the tedious Sundays of death.</t2142><t2143>It was Prudencio Aguilar who cleaned him, fed him, and brought him splendid news of an unknown man named Aureliano who was a colonel in the war.</t2143><t2144>When he was alone, José Arcadio Buendía consoled himself with the dream of infinite rooms.</t2144><t2145>He dreamed that he got out of bed, opened the door, and passed into another identical room, with the same wrought-iron headboard bed, the same wicker chair, and the same little picture of the Virgin of Remedies on the back wall.</t2145><t2146>From that room, he passed into another exactly the same, whose door he opened to pass into another exactly the same, and then another exactly the same, to infinity.</t2146><t2147>He liked to go from room to room, as in a gallery of parallel mirrors, until Prudencio Aguilar touched his shoulder.</t2147><t2148>Then he would return from room to room, waking backward, retracing his steps, and finding Prudencio Aguilar in the room of reality.</t2148><t2149>But one night, two weeks after they took him to bed, Prudencio Aguilar touched his shoulder in an intermediate room, and he stayed there forever, believing it was the real room.</t2149><t2150>The next morning, Úrsula was bringing him breakfast when she saw a man approaching down the corridor.</t2150><t2151>He was small and stocky, with a black wool suit and an enormous black hat, sunk down to his taciturn eyes.</t2151><t2152>"My God," thought Úrsula.</t2152><t2153>"I would have sworn it was Melquíades."</t2153><t2154>It was Cataure, Visitación's brother, who had abandoned the house fleeing from the insomnia plague, and of whom there had never been any news again.</t2154><t2155>Visitación asked him why he had returned, and he answered in his solemn language:</t2155>
<t2156>—I have come to the king's funeral.</t2156>
<t2157>Then they entered José Arcadio Buendía's room, shook him with all their might, shouted in his ear, put a mirror in front of his nostrils, but they couldn't wake him up.</t2157> <t2158>Shortly after, when the carpenter was taking measurements for the coffin, they saw through the window that a drizzle of tiny yellow flowers was falling.</t2158> <t2159>They fell all night over the town in a silent storm, covering the roofs and clogging the doors, and suffocating the animals that slept outdoors.</t2159> <t2160>So many flowers fell from the sky that the streets dawned covered with a compact blanket, and they had to clear them with shovels and rakes so that the burial could pass.</t2160>
<t2161>Sitting in the wicker rocking chair, with her work interrupted on her lap, Amaranta watched Aureliano José with his chin smeared with foam, sharpening the barber's razor on the leaf to shave for the first time.</t2161> <t2162>He nicked his shins, cut his upper lip trying to shape a mustache of blonde fuzz, and after all that, he looked the same as before, but the laborious process left Amaranta with the impression that at that moment he had begun to age.</t2162>
<t2163>—You look just like Aureliano did when he was your age —he said—.</t2163> <t2164>You're already a man.</t2164>
<t2165>It had been so for a long time, since that distant day when Amaranta believed he was still a child and continued undressing in the bathroom in front of him, as she had always done, as she had become accustomed to doing since Pilar Ternera handed him over to her to finish raising him.</t2165><t2166>The first time he saw her, the only thing that caught his attention was the deep depression between her breasts.</t2166><t2167>He was so innocent then that he asked what had happened to her, and Amaranta pretended to dig into her chest with her fingertips and replied, "They took slices and slices and slices out of me."</t2167><t2168>Later, when she recovered from Pietro Crespi's suicide and resumed bathing with Aureliano José, he no longer noticed the depression but instead felt an unfamiliar shudder at the sight of her splendid breasts with purple nipples.</t2168><t2169>He continued examining her, discovering inch by inch the miracle of her intimacy, and felt his skin bristle in contemplation, just as her skin bristled at the touch of the water.</t2169><t2170>Since he was very young, he had the habit of leaving his hammock to wake up in Amaranta's bed, whose touch had the virtue of dispelling his fear of the dark.</t2170><t2171>But from the day he became aware of her nakedness, it was not the fear of the dark that drove him to crawl under her mosquito net, but the longing to feel Amaranta's warm breath at dawn.</t2171><t2172>One early morning, around the time she rejected Colonel Gerineldo Márquez, Aureliano José woke up with the sensation that he was out of breath.</t2172><t2173>He felt Amaranta's fingers like warm, anxious little worms seeking his belly.</t2173><t2174>Pretending to sleep, he changed position to eliminate any difficulty, and then he felt the hand without the black bandage diving like a blind mollusk among the algae of his anxiety.</t2174><t2175>Although they pretended to ignore what they both knew, and what each knew the other knew, from that night on they were bound by an inviolable complicity.</t2175><t2176>Aureliano José could not fall asleep until he heard the twelve o'clock waltz from the clock in the living room, and the mature maiden whose skin was beginning to sadden did not have a moment of peace until she felt that sleepwalker she had raised slipping into the mosquito net, without thinking he would become a palliative for her loneliness.</t2176><t2177>Then they not only slept together, naked, exchanging exhausting caresses, but they chased each other around the corners of the house and locked themselves in the bedrooms at any hour, in a permanent state of unrelieved exaltation.</t2177><t2178>They were almost caught by Úrsula one afternoon when she entered the barn just as they were beginning to kiss.</t2178><t2179>"Do you love your aunt very much?" she asked Aureliano José innocently.</t2179><t2180>He replied that he did.</t2180><t2181>"You do well," Úrsula concluded, and finished measuring the flour for the bread and returned to the kitchen.</t2181><t2182>That episode brought Amaranta out of her delirium.</t2182><t2183>She realized she had gone too far, that she was no longer playing kisses with a child, but floundering in a dangerous, autumnal passion with no future, and she cut it off abruptly.</t2183><t2184>Aureliano José, who was then finishing his military training, eventually accepted reality and went to sleep at the barracks.</t2184><t2185>On Saturdays, he went with the soldiers to Catarino's store.</t2185><t2186>He consoled himself for his abrupt loneliness, for his premature adolescence, with women who smelled of dead flowers, whom he idealized in the darkness and transformed into Amaranta through anxious efforts of imagination.</t2186>
<t2187>Shortly thereafter, contradictory news about the war began to arrive.</t2187> <t2188>While the government itself admitted the progress of the rebellion, the officers in Macondo had confidential reports of the imminence of a negotiated peace.</t2188> <t2189>In early April, a special emissary identified himself to Colonel Gerineldo Márquez.</t2189> <t2190>He confirmed that, indeed, the party leaders had established contacts with rebel leaders in the interior, and were on the verge of negotiating an armistice in exchange for three ministries for the liberals, a minority representation in parliament, and a general amnesty for the rebels who laid down their arms.</t2190> <t2191>The emissary carried a highly confidential order from Colonel Aureliano Buendía, who disagreed with the terms of the armistice.</t2191> <t2192>Colonel Gerineldo Márquez was to select five of his best men and prepare to leave the country with them.</t2192> <t2193>The order was carried out with the utmost secrecy.</t2193> <t2194>A week before the agreement was announced, and amid a storm of contradictory rumors, Colonel Aureliano Buendía and ten trusted officers, including Colonel Roque Carnicero, stealthily arrived in Macondo after midnight, dispersed the garrison, buried the weapons, and destroyed the records.</t2194> <t2195>By dawn, they had left the town with Colonel Gerineldo Márquez and his five officers.</t2195> <t2196>It was such a swift and confidential operation that Úrsula only learned of it at the last moment, when someone tapped on her bedroom window and whispered: "If you want to see Colonel Aureliano Buendía, look out the door right now."</t2196> <t2197>Úrsula jumped out of bed and went to the door in her nightclothes, barely catching a glimpse of the galloping horses leaving the town in a silent cloud of dust.</t2197> <t2198>It was only the next day that she learned Aureliano José had left with his father.</t2198>
<t2199>Ten days after a joint statement from the government and the opposition announced the end of the war, news arrived of the first armed uprising by Colonel Aureliano Buendía on the western border.</t2199> <t2200>His scarce and poorly armed forces were dispersed in less than a week.</t2200> <t2201>But over the course of that year, while liberals and conservatives tried to make the country believe in reconciliation, he attempted seven other uprisings.</t2201> <t2202>One night he shelled Riohacha from a schooner, and in retaliation, the garrison pulled the fourteen most well-known liberals in the town out of their beds and executed them by firing squad.</t2202> <t2203>He occupied a border customs post for more than fifteen days, and from there he issued a call to the nation for a general war.</t2203> <t2204>Another of his expeditions got lost for three months in the jungle, in a foolish attempt to cross more than fifteen hundred kilometers of virgin territories to proclaim war in the suburbs of the capital.</t2204> <t2205>On one occasion, he was less than twenty kilometers from Macondo, and was forced by government patrols to retreat into the mountains very close to the enchanted region where his father had found the fossil of a Spanish galleon many years before.</t2205>
<t2206>During that time, Visitación died.</t2206> <t2207>She had the pleasure of dying a natural death, after having renounced a throne for fear of insomnia, and her last wish was for the salary she had saved for more than twenty years to be dug up from under her bed and sent to Colonel Aureliano Buendía so he could continue the war.</t2207> <t2208>But Úrsula did not bother to retrieve that money, because at that time there were rumors that Colonel Aureliano Buendía had been killed in a landing near the provincial capital.</t2208> <t2209>The official announcement—the fourth in less than two years—was believed to be true for almost six months, as nothing more was heard of him.</t2209> <t2210>Suddenly, when Úrsula and Amaranta had already added a new mourning to the previous ones, an unusual piece of news arrived.</t2210> <t2211>Colonel Aureliano Buendía was alive, but apparently he had given up harassing the government of his country and had joined the triumphant federalism in other Caribbean republics.</t2211> <t2212>He appeared under different names, each time farther from his homeland.</t2212> <t2213>It was later learned that the idea that then motivated him was the unification of the federalist forces of Central America, to sweep away the conservative regimes from Alaska to Patagonia.</t2213> <t2214>The first direct news Úrsula received from him, several years after he had left, was a crumpled and blurry letter that reached her hand to hand from Santiago de Cuba.</t2214>
<t2215>—We have lost him forever —exclaimed Úrsula upon reading it—.</t2215> <t2216>Christmas will pass that way at the end of the world.</t2216>
<t2217>The person to whom he said it, who was the first to whom he showed the letter, was the conservative general José Raquel Moncada, mayor of Macondo since the war ended.</t2217><t2218>"This Aureliano," commented General Moncada, "it's a pity he's not a conservative."</t2218><t2219>He truly admired him.</t2219><t2220>Like many conservative civilians, José Raquel Moncada had fought the war in defense of his party and had achieved the title of general on the battlefield, although he lacked a military vocation.</t2220><t2221>On the contrary, also like many of his fellow party members, he was anti-militarist.</t2221><t2222>He considered military people to be lazy, unprincipled, intriguing, and ambitious, experts in pitting civilians against each other to thrive in disorder.</t2222><t2223>Intelligent, likable, sanguine, a man of good appetite and a fan of cockfights, he had at one point been the most formidable adversary of Colonel Aureliano Buendía.</t2223><t2224>He managed to impose his authority over career military officers in a large sector of the coast.</t2224><t2225>Once, when he was forced by strategic conveniences to abandon a position to the forces of Colonel Aureliano Buendía, he left him two letters.</t2225><t2226>In one of them, very extensive, he invited him to a joint campaign to humanize the war.</t2226><t2227>The other letter was for his wife, who lived in liberal territory, and he left it with the plea to ensure it reached its destination.</t2227><t2228>Since then, even during the most intense periods of the war, the two commanders arranged truces to exchange prisoners.</t2228><t2229>They were pauses with a certain festive atmosphere that General Moncada used to teach Colonel Aureliano Buendía how to play chess.</t2229><t2230>They became great friends.</t2230><t2231>They even came to consider the possibility of coordinating the popular elements of both parties to eliminate the influence of the military and professional politicians, and to establish a humanitarian regime that would take the best from each doctrine.</t2231><t2232>When the war ended, while Colonel Aureliano Buendía was slipping through the ravines of permanent subversion, General Moncada was appointed corregidor of Macondo.</t2232><t2233>He donned his civilian suit, replaced the military with unarmed police agents, enforced the amnesty laws, and assisted some families of liberals who had died in the campaign.</t2233><t2234>He managed to have Macondo established as a municipality and thus became its first mayor, creating an atmosphere of trust that made people think of the war as an absurd nightmare of the past.</t2234><t2235>Father Nicanor, consumed by hepatic fevers, was replaced by Father Coronel, known as El Cachorro, a veteran of the first federalist war.</t2235><t2236>Bruno Crespi, married to Amparo Moscote, whose toy and musical instrument store continued to prosper, built a theater, which Spanish companies included in their itineraries.</t2236><t2237>It was a vast open-air hall, with wooden benches, a velvet curtain with Greek masks, and three ticket booths shaped like lion heads through whose open mouths tickets were sold.</t2237><t2238>It was also around this time that the school building was restored.</t2238><t2239>It was taken over by Don Melchor Escalona, an old teacher sent from the swamp, who made undisciplined students walk on their knees in the caliche yard and made the talkative ones eat hot chili peppers, with the parents' approval.</t2239><t2240>Aureliano Segundo and José Arcadio Segundo, the determined twins of Santa Sofía de la Piedad, were the first to sit in the classroom with their slates, chalks, and aluminum mugs marked with their names.</t2240><t2241>Remedios, inheritor of her mother's pure beauty, was beginning to be known as Remedios the Beautiful.</t2241><t2242>Despite the time, the overlapping mourning periods, and accumulated afflictions, Úrsula resisted aging.</t2242><t2243>Helped by Santa Sofía de la Piedad, she had given a new impetus to her pastry business, and not only recovered in a few years the fortune her son had spent in the war, but also refilled the pure gold gourds buried in the bedroom.</t2243><t2244>"As long as God gives me life," she used to say, "there will be no lack of money in this house of madness."</t2244><t2245>That was how things were when Aureliano José deserted from the federalist troops of Nicaragua, enlisted in the crew of a German ship, and appeared in the kitchen of the house, solid as a horse, dark and hairy like an Indian, with the secret determination to marry Amaranta.</t2245>
<t2246>When Amaranta saw him enter, without him having said anything, she immediately knew why he had returned.</t2246><t2247>At the table, they did not dare to look each other in the face.</t2247><t2248>But two weeks after his return, with Úrsula present, he fixed his eyes on hers and said, "I always thought a lot about you."</t2248><t2249>Amaranta avoided him.</t2249><t2250>She guarded against casual encounters.</t2250><t2251>She tried not to separate from Remedios, the beautiful.</t2251><t2252>She was outraged by the blush that gilded her cheeks the day her nephew asked her how long she planned to wear the black bandage on her hand, because she interpreted the question as an allusion to her virginity.</t2252><t2253>When he arrived, she bolted her bedroom door, but after so many nights of hearing his peaceful snores in the next room, she neglected that precaution.</t2253><t2254>One early morning, almost two months after his return, she felt him enter the bedroom.</t2254><t2255>Then, instead of fleeing, instead of screaming as she had planned, she let herself be saturated by a soft sensation of rest.</t2255><t2256>She felt him slip under the mosquito net, as he had done when he was a child, as he had always done, and she couldn't suppress the cold sweat and the chattering of her teeth when she realized he was completely naked.</t2256><t2257>"Go away," she murmured, choking with curiosity.</t2257><t2258>"Go away or I'll start screaming."</t2258><t2259>But Aureliano José then knew what he had to do, because he was no longer a child afraid of the dark but a camp animal.</t2259><t2260>From that night on, the silent battles without consequences resumed and lasted until dawn.</t2260><t2261>"I am your aunt," Amaranta murmured, exhausted.</t2261><t2262>"It's almost as if I were your mother, not only because of the age difference, but because the only thing I didn't do was nurse you."</t2262><t2263>Aureliano escaped at dawn and returned the next morning, increasingly excited by the realization that she did not bolt the door.</t2263><t2264>He had not stopped desiring her for a single moment.</t2264><t2265>He found her in the dark bedrooms of the defeated towns, especially in the most abject ones, and materialized her in the stench of dried blood on the bandages of the wounded, in the instant fear of death, at all hours and in all places.</t2265><t2266>He had fled from her, trying to annihilate her memory not only with distance but with a dazed ferocity that his comrades in arms described as recklessness, but the more he wallowed her image in the filth of war, the more the war resembled Amaranta.</t2266><t2267>Thus he endured exile, seeking a way to kill her with his own death, until he heard her tell someone the old story of the man who married an aunt who was also his cousin, and whose son ended up being his own grandfather.</t2267>
<t2268>—Can one marry an aunt? —he asked, astonished.</t2268>
<t2269>—Not only is it possible —a soldier replied to him— but we are fighting this war against the priests so that one can marry his own mother.</t2269>
<t2270>Fifteen days later he deserted.</t2270> <t2271>He found Amaranta more withered than in his memory, more melancholic and prudish, and already truly rounding the last bend of maturity, but more feverish than ever in the darkness of the bedroom and more defiant than ever in the aggressiveness of her resistance: "You are a brute," Amaranta would say, harassed by her watchdogs.</t2271> <t2272>"It's not true that one can do this to a poor aunt, unless with a special dispensation from the Pope."</t2272> <t2273>Aureliano José promised to go to Rome, promised to travel across Europe on his knees, and kiss the sandals of the Supreme Pontiff just so she would lower her drawbridges.</t2273>
<t2274>—It's not just that —Amaranta argued—.</t2274> <t2275>It's that children are born with pig tails.</t2275>
<t2276>Aureliano José was deaf to all arguments.</t2276>
<t2277>—Even if armadillos are born —he pleaded.</t2277>
<t2278>One early morning, overcome by the unbearable pain of repressed manhood, he went to Catarino's store.</t2278> <t2279>He found a woman with flaccid breasts, affectionate and cheap, who soothed his belly for a while.</t2279> <t2280>He tried to apply the treatment of disdain to Amaranta.</t2280> <t2281>He saw her in the corridor, sewing on a hand-crank machine that she had learned to operate with admirable skill, and he didn't even speak to her.</t2281> <t2282>Amaranta felt liberated from a burden, and she herself didn't understand why she then began to think of Colonel Gerineldo Márquez, why she nostalgically recalled the afternoons of Chinese checkers, and why she even came to desire him as a bedroom man.</t2282> <t2283>Aureliano José did not realize how much ground he had lost, the night he could no longer resist the pretense of indifference, and returned to Amaranta's room.</t2283> <t2284>She rejected him with inflexible, unequivocal determination, and forever bolted the bedroom door.</t2284>
<t2285>A few months after Aureliano José's return, an exuberant woman, scented with jasmine, arrived at the house with a child of about five years old.</t2285> <t2286>She claimed that he was the son of Colonel Aureliano Buendía and had brought him for Úrsula to baptize.</t2286> <t2287>No one doubted the origin of that nameless child: he was just like the colonel when they took him to see the ice.</t2287> <t2288>The woman said that he was born with his eyes open, looking at people with the judgment of an adult, and that his way of staring at things without blinking frightened her.</t2288> <t2289>"He is identical," said Úrsula.</t2289> <t2290>"The only thing missing is for him to make the chairs move just by looking at them."</t2290> <t2291>They baptized him with the name Aureliano, and with his mother's surname, because the law did not allow him to carry his father's surname unless he recognized him.</t2291> <t2292>General Moncada served as godfather.</t2292> <t2293>Although Amaranta insisted on keeping him to finish raising him, the mother refused.</t2293>
<t2294>Úrsula was unaware at the time of the custom of sending maidens to the bedrooms of warriors, much like fine roosters are given hens, but over the course of that year, she found out: nine more sons of Colonel Aureliano Buendía were brought to the house to be baptized.</t2294> <t2295>The eldest, a strange dark-skinned boy with green eyes who bore no resemblance to the paternal family, was over ten years old.</t2295> <t2296>They brought children of all ages, of all colors, but all boys, and all with an air of solitude that left no doubt about their kinship.</t2296> <t2297>Only two stood out from the crowd.</t2297> <t2298>One, too big for his age, who shattered vases and several pieces of crockery because his hands seemed to have the property of breaking everything they touched.</t2298> <t2299>The other was a blond boy with the same hazel eyes as his mother, whose hair had been left long and curly, like a girl's.</t2299> <t2300>He entered the house with great familiarity, as if he had been raised there, and went directly to a chest in Úrsula's bedroom, demanding: "I want the wind-up dancer."</t2300> <t2301>Úrsula was frightened.</t2301> <t2302>She opened the chest, rummaged through the old and dusty objects from Melquíades' time, and found the wind-up dancer wrapped in a pair of stockings, which Pietro Crespi had once brought to the house and which no one had remembered since.</t2302> <t2303>In less than two years, all the children that the colonel had scattered across his war territories were baptized with the name Aureliano and their mother's surname: seventeen in total.</t2303> <t2304>At first, Úrsula filled their pockets with money, and Amaranta tried to keep them.</t2304> <t2305>But they ended up limiting themselves to giving them a gift and serving as their godmothers.</t2305> <t2306>"We fulfilled our duty by baptizing them," Úrsula said, noting in a notebook the name and address of the mothers and the place and date of birth of the children.</t2306> <t2307>"Aureliano must keep good records, so he will be the one to make decisions when he returns."</t2307> <t2308>During a lunch, commenting with General Moncada on that bewildering proliferation, she expressed the wish that Colonel Aureliano Buendía would someday return to gather all his children in the house.</t2308>
<t2309>—Don't worry, comadre —said General Moncada enigmatically—.</t2309> <t2310>He will come sooner than you imagine.</t2310>
<t2311>What General Moncada knew, and did not want to reveal at lunch, was that Colonel Aureliano Buendía was already on his way to lead the longest, most radical, and bloodiest rebellion attempted until then.</t2311>
<t2312>The situation became as tense as it was in the months leading up to the first war.</t2312> <t2313>The cockfights, encouraged by the mayor himself, were suspended.</t2313> <t2314>Captain Aquiles Ricardo, commander of the garrison, practically assumed municipal power.</t2314> <t2315>The liberals pointed to him as a provocateur.</t2315> <t2316>“Something terrible is going to happen,” Úrsula told Aureliano José.</t2316> <t2317>“Don’t go out after six in the evening.”</t2317> <t2318>They were useless pleas.</t2318> <t2319>Aureliano José, like Arcadio in another era, had ceased to belong to her.</t2319> <t2320>It was as if returning home, the possibility of existing without worrying about daily urgencies, had awakened in him the lustful and idle vocation of his uncle José Arcadio.</t2320> <t2321>His passion for Amaranta extinguished without leaving scars.</t2321> <t2322>He wandered a bit aimlessly, playing billiards, coping with his loneliness with occasional women, looting the nooks where Úrsula forgot the misplaced money.</t2322> <t2323>He ended up only returning home to change clothes.</t2323> <t2324>“They are all the same,” Úrsula lamented.</t2324> <t2325>“At first they are raised very well, they are obedient and formal and seem incapable of killing a fly, and as soon as they grow a beard they throw themselves into perdition.”</t2325> <t2326>Unlike Arcadio, who never knew his true origin, he found out that he was the son of Pilar Ternera, who had hung a hammock for him to take a nap in her house.</t2326> <t2327>They were, more than mother and son, accomplices in solitude.</t2327> <t2328>Pilar Ternera had lost the trace of all hope.</t2328> <t2329>Her laughter had acquired organ-like tones, her breasts had succumbed to the tedium of occasional caresses, her belly and thighs had been victims of her irrevocable destiny as a shared woman, but her heart aged without bitterness.</t2329> <t2330>Fat, talkative, with airs of a matron in disgrace, she renounced the sterile illusion of the cards and found a haven of consolation in the loves of others.</t2330> <t2331>In the house where Aureliano José took his nap, the neighborhood girls received their casual lovers.</t2331> <t2332>“Can I borrow the room, Pilar,” they would simply say when they were already inside.</t2332> <t2333>“Of course,” Pilar would say.</t2333> <t2334>And if someone was present, she would explain:</t2334>
<t2335>—I am happy knowing that people are happy in bed.</t2335>
<t2336>She never charged for the service.</t2336> <t2337>She never refused a favor, just as she did not refuse it to the countless men who sought her even in the twilight of her maturity, without providing her with money or love, and only sometimes pleasure.</t2337> <t2338>Her five daughters, inheritors of a burning seed, lost themselves in the twists and turns of life since adolescence.</t2338> <t2339>Of the two sons she managed to raise, one died fighting in the ranks of Colonel Aureliano Buendía and the other was wounded and captured at fourteen, when he tried to steal a crate of chickens in a swamp village.</t2339> <t2340>In a way, Aureliano José was the tall, dark man who for half a century announced the king of cups to her, and like all the messengers of the cards, he reached her heart when it was already marked by the sign of death.</t2340> <t2341>She saw him in the cards.</t2341>
<t2342>—Don't go out tonight —he told her—.</t2342> <t2343>Stay here and sleep, because Carmelita Montiel has been begging me to let her into your room.</t2343>
<t2344>Aureliano José did not grasp the profound sense of supplication that offer had.</t2344>
<t2345>—Tell him to wait for me at midnight —he said.</t2345>
<t2346>He went to the theater where a Spanish company was announcing The Dagger of the Fox, which was actually Zorrilla's play with the name changed by order of Captain Aquiles Ricardo, because the liberals called the conservatives "goths."</t2346> <t2347>Only at the moment of handing over the ticket at the door did Aureliano José realize that Captain Aquiles Ricardo, with two soldiers armed with rifles, was frisking the attendees.</t2347> <t2348>"Careful, captain," Aureliano José warned him.</t2348> <t2349>"The man who can lay hands on me has not yet been born."</t2349> <t2350>The captain tried to frisk him by force, and Aureliano José, who was unarmed, started to run.</t2350> <t2351>The soldiers disobeyed the order to shoot.</t2351> <t2352>"He's a Buendía," explained one of them.</t2352> <t2353>Blinded by fury, the captain then snatched the rifle, stepped into the middle of the street, and aimed.</t2353>
<t2354>—Bastards! —he managed to shout—.</t2354> <t2355>I wish I were Colonel Aureliano Buendía.</t2355>
<t2356>Carmelita Montiel, a twenty-year-old virgin, had just bathed with orange blossom water and was sprinkling rosemary leaves on Pilar Ternera's bed when the shot rang out.</t2356> <t2357>Aureliano José was destined to find with her the happiness that Amaranta had denied him, to have seven children, and to die of old age in her arms, but the rifle bullet that entered through his back and shattered his chest was directed by a misinterpretation of the cards.</t2357> <t2358>Captain Aquiles Ricardo, who was actually the one destined to die that night, indeed died four hours before Aureliano José.</t2358> <t2359>As soon as the shot rang out, he was struck down by two simultaneous bullets, the origin of which was never established, and a multitude of cries shook the night.</t2359>
<t2360>—Long live the Liberal Party!</t2360> <t2361>Long live Colonel Aureliano Buendía!</t2361>
<t2362>At twelve o'clock, when Aureliano José had finished bleeding out and Carmelita Montiel found the cards of her future blank, more than four hundred men had marched in front of the theater and had unloaded their revolvers into the abandoned corpse of Captain Aquiles Ricardo.</t2362> <t2363>A patrol was needed to put the lead-laden body, which was falling apart like a soaked loaf of bread, into a wheelbarrow.</t2363>
<t2364>Upset by the impertinences of the regular army, General José Raquel Moncada mobilized his political influences, donned the uniform again, and assumed the civil and military leadership of Macondo.</t2364> <t2365>He did not expect, however, that his conciliatory attitude could prevent the inevitable.</t2365> <t2366>The news in September was contradictory.</t2366> <t2367>While the government announced that it maintained control throughout the country, the liberals received secret reports of armed uprisings in the interior.</t2367> <t2368>The regime did not admit the state of war until it was proclaimed in a decree that Colonel Aureliano Buendía had been court-martialed in absentia and sentenced to death.</t2368> <t2369>The order was to carry out the sentence by the first garrison that captured him.</t2369> <t2370>"This means he has returned," Úrsula rejoiced before General Moncada.</t2370> <t2371>But he himself was unaware of it.</t2371>
<t2372>In reality, Colonel Aureliano Buendía had been in the country for more than a month.</t2372> <t2373>Preceded by contradictory rumors, supposedly in the most remote places at the same time, General Moncada himself did not believe in his return until it was officially announced that he had taken over two coastal states.</t2373> <t2374>“I congratulate you, comadre,” he said to Úrsula, showing her the telegram.</t2374> <t2375>“You will have him here very soon.”</t2375> <t2376>Úrsula then became worried for the first time.</t2376> <t2377>“And what will you do, compadre?” she asked.</t2377> <t2378>General Moncada had asked himself that question many times.</t2378>
<t2379>—The same as him, comadre —he replied—: to fulfill my duty.</t2379>
<t2380>On the first of October, at dawn, Colonel Aureliano Buendía with a thousand well-armed men attacked Macondo, and the garrison received the order to resist until the end.</t2380> <t2381>At noon, while General Moncada was having lunch with Úrsula, a rebel cannon shot that echoed throughout the town pulverized the facade of the municipal treasury.</t2381> <t2382>«They are as well-armed as we are,» sighed General Moncada, «but they also fight with more determination.»</t2382> <t2383>At two in the afternoon, while the ground trembled with cannon shots from both sides, he said goodbye to Úrsula with the certainty that he was fighting a lost battle.</t2383>
<t2384>—I pray to God that Aureliano is not in the house tonight —he said—.</t2384> <t2385>If he is, give him a hug from me, because I do not expect to see him ever again.</t2385>
<t2386>That night he was captured while trying to escape from Macondo, after writing an extensive letter to Colonel Aureliano Buendía, in which he reminded him of their common goals of humanizing the war, and wished him a definitive victory against the corruption of the military and the ambitions of politicians from both parties.</t2386><t2387>The next day, Colonel Aureliano Buendía had lunch with him at Úrsula's house, where he was confined until a revolutionary war council decided his fate.</t2387><t2388>It was a family gathering.</t2388><t2389>But while the adversaries forgot the war to recall memories of the past, Úrsula had the grim impression that her son was an intruder.</t2389><t2390>She had had it since she saw him enter protected by a noisy military apparatus that turned the bedrooms upside down until they were convinced there was no risk.</t2390><t2391>Colonel Aureliano Buendía not only accepted him but also issued orders with a decisive severity, and did not allow anyone to approach him within three meters, not even Úrsula, until the members of his escort finished setting up the guards around the house.</t2391><t2392>He wore an ordinary drill uniform, without any insignia, and high boots smeared with mud and dried blood.</t2392><t2393>He carried a pistol at his waist with the holster unbuttoned, and his hand always resting on the grip revealed the same vigilant and resolute tension as his gaze.</t2393><t2394>His head, now with deep receding hairlines, seemed slow-cooked.</t2394><t2395>His face, cracked by the Caribbean salt, had acquired a metallic hardness.</t2395><t2396>He was preserved against imminent old age by a vitality that had something to do with the coldness of his insides.</t2396><t2397>He was taller than when he left, paler and bonier, and showed the first symptoms of resistance to nostalgia.</t2397><t2398>"My God," Úrsula said to herself, alarmed.</t2398><t2399>"Now he seems like a man capable of anything."</t2399><t2400>He was.</t2400><t2401>The Aztec shawl he brought to Amaranta, the recollections he made at lunch, the amusing anecdotes he told were mere embers of his humor from another era.</t2401><t2402>No sooner had the order to bury the dead in the common grave been carried out, he assigned Colonel Roque Carnicero the mission of expediting the war trials, and he undertook the exhausting task of imposing radical reforms that would leave no stone unturned in the crumbling structure of the conservative regime.</t2402><t2403>"We have to get ahead of the party politicians," he told his advisors.</t2403><t2404>"When they open their eyes to reality, they will find the accomplished facts."</t2404><t2405>It was then that he decided to review the land ownership titles, going back a hundred years, and discovered the legalized outrages of his brother José Arcadio.</t2405><t2406>He annulled the records with a stroke of the pen.</t2406><t2407>In a final gesture of courtesy, he neglected his affairs for an hour and visited Rebeca to inform her of his determination.</t2407>
<t2408>In the dim light of the house, the lonely widow who was once the confidante of his repressed loves, and whose obstinacy saved his life, was a specter of the past.</t2408> <t2409>Clad in black up to her wrists, with a heart turned to ashes, she barely had any news of the war.</t2409> <t2410>Colonel Aureliano Buendía had the impression that the phosphorescence of her bones pierced her skin, and that she moved through an atmosphere of will-o'-the-wisps, in stagnant air where a faint smell of gunpowder still lingered.</t2410> <t2411>He began by advising her to moderate the rigor of her mourning, to air out the house, to forgive the world for the death of José Arcadio.</t2411> <t2412>But Rebeca was already beyond all vanity.</t2412> <t2413>After searching for her in vain in the taste of the earth, in the perfumed letters of Pietro Crespi, in the tempestuous bed of her husband, she had found peace in that house where memories materialized by the force of relentless evocation, and wandered like human beings through the closed rooms.</t2413> <t2414>Stretched out in her wicker rocker, looking at Colonel Aureliano Buendía as if he were the one who seemed like a specter of the past, Rebeca was not even moved by the news that the lands usurped by José Arcadio would be returned to their rightful owners.</t2414>
<t2415>—It will be done as you decide, Aureliano —she sighed—.</t2415> <t2416>I always believed, and I confirm it now, that you are a renegade.</t2416>
<t2417>The review of property titles was completed at the same time as the summary trials, presided over by Colonel Gerineldo Márquez, which concluded with the execution by firing squad of all the regular army officers who were prisoners of the revolutionaries.</t2417> <t2418>The last court-martial was that of General José Raquel Moncada.</t2418> <t2419>Úrsula intervened.</t2419> <t2420>“He is the best ruler we have had in Macondo,” she told Colonel Aureliano Buendía.</t2420> <t2421>“I don’t even need to tell you about his good heart, about the affection he has for us, because you know him better than anyone.”</t2421> <t2422>Colonel Aureliano Buendía fixed a reproachful gaze on her:</t2422>
<t2423>—I cannot arrogate to myself the faculty of administering justice —he replied—.</t2423> <t2424>If you have something to say, say it before the court-martial.</t2424>
<t2425>Úrsula not only did it, but she also brought in all the mothers of the revolutionary officers living in Macondo to testify.</t2425> <t2426>One by one, the old founders of the town, several of whom had participated in the daring crossing of the mountains, extolled the virtues of General Moncada.</t2426> <t2427>Úrsula was the last in the parade.</t2427> <t2428>Her mournful dignity, the weight of her name, the convincing vehemence of her statement momentarily shook the balance of justice.</t2428> <t2429>“You have taken this dreadful game very seriously, and you have done well, because you are fulfilling your duty,” she said to the members of the tribunal.</t2429> <t2430>“But do not forget that as long as God gives us life, we will continue to be mothers, and no matter how revolutionary you are, we have the right to pull down your pants and give you a whipping at the first sign of disrespect.”</t2430> <t2431>The jury withdrew to deliberate while these words still echoed in the converted school-turned-barracks.</t2431> <t2432>At midnight, General José Raquel Moncada was sentenced to death.</t2432> <t2433>Colonel Aureliano Buendía, despite Úrsula's violent recriminations, refused to commute the sentence.</t2433> <t2434>Shortly before dawn, he visited the condemned man in the stockade room.</t2434>
<t2435>—Remember, compadre —he said to him—, that it is not I who am executing you.</t2435> <t2436>The revolution is executing you.</t2436>
<t2437>The general Moncada didn't even get up from the cot when he saw him enter.</t2437>
<t2438>—Go to hell, buddy —he replied.</t2438>
<t2439>Until that moment, since his return, Colonel Aureliano Buendía had not allowed himself the opportunity to see him with his heart.</t2439> <t2440>He was astonished at how much he had aged, at the tremor in his hands, at the somewhat routine acceptance with which he awaited death, and then he experienced a deep contempt for himself that he confused with a beginning of mercy.</t2440>
<t2441>—You know better than I do —he said— that every court-martial is a farce, and that you truly have to pay for the crimes of others, because this time we are going to win the war at any cost.</t2441> <t2442>If you were in my place, wouldn't you have done the same?</t2442>
<t2443>The general Moncada stood up to clean his thick tortoiseshell glasses with the tail of his shirt.</t2443> <t2444>"Probably," he said.</t2444> <t2445>"But what worries me is not that you will shoot me, because after all, for people like us this is the natural death."</t2445> <t2446>He placed the glasses on the bed and took off his pocket watch.</t2446> <t2447>"What worries me," he added, "is that from hating the military so much, from fighting them so much, from thinking about them so much, you have ended up being just like them.</t2447> <t2448>And there is no ideal in life that deserves such abjection."</t2448> <t2449>He took off his wedding ring and the medal of the Virgin of Remedies and placed them along with the glasses and the watch.</t2449>
<t2450>—At this rate —he concluded— not only will you become the most despotic and bloodthirsty dictator in our history, but you will also execute my friend Úrsula in an attempt to appease your conscience.</t2450>
<t2451>Colonel Aureliano Buendía remained impassive.</t2451> <t2452>General Moncada then handed him the glasses, the medal, the watch, and the ring, and changed his tone.</t2452>
<t2453>—But I didn't make you come to scold you —he said—.</t2453> <t2454>I wanted to beg you the favor of sending these things to my wife.</t2454>
<t2455>Colonel Aureliano Buendía put them in his pockets.</t2455>
<t2456>—Is he still in Manaure?</t2456>
<t2457>—He is still in Manaure —confirmed General Moncada—, in the same house behind the church where you sent that letter.</t2457>
<t2458>—I will do it with great pleasure, José Raquel —said Colonel Aureliano Buendía.</t2458>
<t2459>When he stepped into the blue misty air, his face became moist as it had in another dawn of the past, and only then did he understand why he had arranged for the sentence to be carried out in the courtyard, and not at the cemetery wall.</t2459> <t2460>The squad, formed up in front of the door, gave him the honors of a head of state.</t2460>
<t2461>—You can bring him now —he ordered.</t2461>
<t2462>Colonel Gerineldo Márquez was the first to perceive the emptiness of the war.</t2462> <t2463>In his capacity as the civil and military chief of Macondo, he held telegraphic conversations twice a week with Colonel Aureliano Buendía.</t2463> <t2464>At the beginning, those interviews determined the course of a flesh-and-blood war whose perfectly defined contours allowed one to establish at any moment the exact point it was at, and to foresee its future directions.</t2464> <t2465>Although he never allowed himself to be drawn into confidences, not even by his closest friends, Colonel Aureliano Buendía then maintained the familiar tone that allowed him to be identified at the other end of the line.</t2465> <t2466>Many times he prolonged the conversations beyond the scheduled end and let them drift into comments of a domestic nature.</t2466> <t2467>Little by little, however, and as the war intensified and spread, his image began to fade into a universe of unreality.</t2467> <t2468>The dots and dashes of his voice became increasingly remote and uncertain, and they joined and combined to form words that gradually lost all meaning.</t2468> <t2469>Colonel Gerineldo Márquez then limited himself to listening, overwhelmed by the impression of being in telegraphic contact with a stranger from another world.</t2469>
<t2470>—Understood, Aureliano —he concluded on the manipulator—.</t2470> <t2471>Long live the Liberal Party!</t2471>
<t2472>He ended up losing all contact with the war.</t2472> <t2473>What had once been a real activity, an irresistible passion of his youth, became for him a remote reference: a void.</t2473> <t2474>His only refuge was Amaranta's sewing room.</t2474> <t2475>He visited her every afternoon.</t2475> <t2476>He liked to watch her hands while she curled foam lace on the hand-cranked machine that Remedios the Beauty would turn.</t2476> <t2477>They would spend many hours without speaking, content with each other's company, but while Amaranta secretly delighted in keeping the fire of his devotion alive, he was unaware of the secret designs of that inscrutable heart.</t2477> <t2478>When the news of his return became known, Amaranta had been overwhelmed with anxiety.</t2478> <t2479>But when she saw him enter the house, mingled with the noisy escort of Colonel Aureliano Buendía, and saw him battered by the harshness of exile, aged by time and forgetfulness, dirty with sweat and dust, smelling of livestock, ugly, with his left arm in a sling, she felt faint with disappointment.</t2479> <t2480>"My God," she thought, "this is not the one I was waiting for."</t2480> <t2481>The next day, however, he returned to the house shaved and clean, with his mustache scented with lavender water and without the bloodstained sling.</t2481> <t2482>He brought her a breviary with mother-of-pearl covers.</t2482>
<t2483>—How strange men are —she said, because she couldn't find anything else to say—.</t2483> <t2484>They spend their lives fighting against priests and give away prayer books.</t2484>
<t2485>Since then, even on the most critical days of the war, he visited her every afternoon.</t2485> <t2486>Many times, when Remedios the Beauty was not present, it was he who turned the wheel of the sewing machine.</t2486> <t2487>Amaranta felt disturbed by the perseverance, loyalty, and submission of that man vested with so much authority, who nevertheless disarmed himself in the living room to enter defenseless into the sewing room.</t2487> <t2488>But for four years he reiterated his love, and she always found a way to reject him without hurting him, because although she couldn't love him, she could no longer live without him.</t2488> <t2489>Remedios the Beauty, who seemed indifferent to everything and was thought to be mentally retarded, was not insensitive to such devotion and intervened in favor of Colonel Gerineldo Márquez.</t2489> <t2490>Amaranta suddenly discovered that the girl she had raised, who was just entering adolescence, was already the most beautiful creature ever seen in Macondo.</t2490> <t2491>She felt the resurgence in her heart of the resentment she once felt against Rebeca, and praying to God not to be driven to the extent of wishing her death, she banished her from the sewing room.</t2491> <t2492>It was around that time that Colonel Gerineldo Márquez began to feel the weariness of the war.</t2492> <t2493>He appealed to his reserves of persuasion, to his immense and repressed tenderness, willing to renounce for Amaranta a glory that had cost him the sacrifice of his best years.</t2493> <t2494>But he could not convince her.</t2494> <t2495>One August afternoon, overwhelmed by the unbearable weight of her own obstinacy, Amaranta locked herself in the bedroom to cry her loneliness to death, after giving her persistent suitor the final answer.</t2495>
<t2496>—Let's forget about each other forever —he said to her—, we are too old for these things now.</t2496>
<t2497>Colonel Gerineldo Márquez attended that afternoon to a telegraphic call from Colonel Aureliano Buendía.</t2497> <t2498>It was a routine conversation that would not open any breach in the stagnant war.</t2498> <t2499>At the end, Colonel Gerineldo Márquez contemplated the desolate streets, the crystallized water on the almond trees, and found himself lost in solitude.</t2499>
<t2500>—Aureliano —he said sadly on the manipulator—, it's raining in Macondo.</t2500>
<t2501>There was a long silence on the line.</t2501> <t2502>Suddenly, the devices jumped with the ruthless signs of Colonel Aureliano Buendía.</t2502>
<t2503>—Don't be an idiot, Gerineldo —said the signs—.</t2503> <t2504>It's natural for it to be raining in August.</t2504>
<t2505>They had gone so long without seeing each other that Colonel Gerineldo Márquez was taken aback by the aggressiveness of that reaction.</t2505> <t2506>However, two months later, when Colonel Aureliano Buendía returned to Macondo, the bewilderment turned into astonishment.</t2506> <t2507>Even Úrsula was surprised at how much he had changed.</t2507> <t2508>He arrived quietly, without an escort, wrapped in a blanket despite the heat, and with three lovers whom he installed in the same house, where he spent most of his time lying in a hammock.</t2508> <t2509>He barely read the telegraphic dispatches that reported routine operations.</t2509> <t2510>On one occasion, Colonel Gerineldo Márquez asked him for instructions on the evacuation of a border town that threatened to become an international conflict.</t2510>
<t2511>—Don't bother me with trivialities —he ordered—.</t2511> <t2512>Consult it with Divine Providence.</t2512>
<t2513>It was perhaps the most critical moment of the war.</t2513> <t2514>The liberal landowners, who initially supported the revolution, had entered into secret alliances with the conservative landowners to prevent the review of property titles.</t2514> <t2515>The politicians who were capitalizing on the war from exile had publicly repudiated the drastic determinations of Colonel Aureliano Buendía, but even that disavowal seemed not to concern him.</t2515> <t2516>He had not returned to reading his verses, which occupied more than five volumes and remained forgotten at the bottom of the trunk.</t2516> <t2517>At night, or during siesta time, he would call one of his women to the hammock and obtain from her a rudimentary satisfaction, and then he would sleep with a stone-like slumber that was not disturbed by the slightest hint of worry.</t2517> <t2518>Only he knew then that his bewildered heart was forever condemned to uncertainty.</t2518> <t2519>At the beginning, intoxicated by the glory of his return, by the unbelievable victories, he had peered into the abyss of greatness.</t2519> <t2520>He took pleasure in keeping the Duke of Marlborough, his great master in the arts of war, at his right hand, whose attire of furs and tiger claws elicited the respect of adults and the astonishment of children.</t2520> <t2521>It was then that he decided that no human being, not even Úrsula, should approach him within three meters.</t2521> <t2522>In the center of the chalk circle that his aides would draw wherever he arrived, and into which only he could enter, he would decide the fate of the world with brief and unappealable orders.</t2522> <t2523>The first time he was in Manaure after the execution of General Moncada, he hastened to fulfill his victim's last wish, and the widow received the glasses, the medal, the watch, and the ring, but she did not allow him to go beyond the door.</t2523>
<t2524>—Don't come in, Colonel —he said to him—.</t2524> <t2525>You may command in your war, but I command in my house.</t2525>
<t2526>Colonel Aureliano Buendía showed no signs of resentment, but his spirit only found peace when his personal guard looted and burned the widow's house to ashes.</t2526> <t2527>"Take care of your heart, Aureliano," Colonel Gerineldo Márquez would say to him then.</t2527> <t2528>"You're rotting alive."</t2528> <t2529>During that time, he convened a second assembly of the main rebel commanders.</t2529> <t2530>He found all sorts: idealists, ambitious men, adventurers, social resentfuls, and even common criminals.</t2530> <t2531>There was even a former conservative official who had taken refuge in the revolt to escape a trial for embezzlement.</t2531> <t2532>Many didn't even know why they were fighting.</t2532> <t2533>Amid that motley crowd, whose differences in opinion were on the verge of causing an internal explosion, a sinister authority stood out: General Teófilo Vargas.</t2533> <t2534>He was a pure, wild, illiterate Indian, endowed with a taciturn malice and a messianic vocation that incited a mad fanaticism in his men.</t2534> <t2535>Colonel Aureliano Buendía organized the meeting with the purpose of unifying the rebel command against the maneuvers of the politicians.</t2535> <t2536>General Teófilo Vargas preempted his intentions: in a few hours, he dismantled the coalition of the best-qualified commanders and seized central command.</t2536> <t2537>"He's a beast to be wary of," Colonel Aureliano Buendía told his officers.</t2537> <t2538>"For us, that man is more dangerous than the Minister of War."</t2538> <t2539>Then a very young captain, who had always been distinguished by his shyness, raised a cautious index finger.</t2539>
<t2540>—It's very simple, Colonel —he proposed—: we have to kill him.</t2540>
<t2541>Colonel Aureliano Buendía was not alarmed by the coldness of the proposition, but by the way it anticipated a fraction of a second ahead of his own thought.</t2541>
<t2542>—Don't expect me to give that order —he said.</t2542>
<t2543>He did not give it, indeed.</t2543> <t2544>But fifteen days later, General Teófilo Vargas was hacked to pieces with machetes in an ambush, and Colonel Aureliano Buendía assumed central command.</t2544> <t2545>The same night his authority was recognized by all the rebel commands, he woke up startled, shouting for a blanket.</t2545> <t2546>An internal cold that reached his bones and tormented him even in broad daylight prevented him from sleeping well for several months, until it became a habit.</t2546> <t2547>The intoxication of power began to decompose into bursts of unease.</t2547> <t2548>Seeking a remedy for the cold, he had the young officer who proposed the assassination of General Teófilo Vargas executed by firing squad.</t2548> <t2549>His orders were carried out before being given, even before he conceived them, and they always reached much further than he would have dared to send them.</t2549> <t2550>Lost in the solitude of his immense power, he began to lose his way.</t2550> <t2551>He was annoyed by the people who acclaimed him in the conquered towns, who seemed to him the same people who acclaimed the enemy.</t2551> <t2552>Everywhere he found adolescents who looked at him with his own eyes, who spoke with his own voice, who greeted him with the same distrust with which he greeted them, and who claimed to be his children.</t2552> <t2553>He felt scattered, repeated, and more solitary than ever.</t2553> <t2554>He was convinced that his own officers were lying to him.</t2554> <t2555>He quarreled with the Duke of Marlborough.</t2555> <t2556>"The best friend," he used to say then, "is the one who has just died."</t2556> <t2557>He grew tired of the uncertainty, the vicious circle of that eternal war that always found him in the same place, only each time older, more worn out, more without knowing why, or how, or until when.</t2557> <t2558>There was always someone outside the chalk circle.</t2558> <t2559>Someone who needed money, who had a child with whooping cough, or who wanted to go to sleep forever because they could no longer bear the taste of war in their mouth, and who, nevertheless, stood at attention with their last reserves of energy to report: "All normal, my colonel."</t2559> <t2560>And normality was precisely the most horrifying thing about that infinite war: that nothing happened.</t2560> <t2561>Alone, abandoned by omens, fleeing from the cold that would accompany him until death, he sought a last refuge in Macondo, in the warmth of his oldest memories.</t2561> <t2562>His apathy was so severe that when he was informed of the arrival of a commission from his party authorized to discuss the crossroads of the war, he turned over in the hammock without fully waking up.</t2562>
<t2563>—Take them to the whores —he said.</t2563>
<t2564>They were six lawyers in frock coats and top hats who endured the fierce November sun with hard stoicism.</t2564> <t2565>Úrsula hosted them in the house.</t2565> <t2566>They spent most of the day locked in the bedroom in hermetic consultations, and at nightfall, they would ask for an escort and a set of accordions and take over Catarino's store.</t2566> <t2567>"Do not bother them," ordered Colonel Aureliano Buendía.</t2567> <t2568>"After all, I know what they want."</t2568> <t2569>At the beginning of December, the long-awaited interview, which many had predicted would be an endless discussion, was resolved in less than an hour.</t2569>
<t2570>In the hot visiting room, next to the specter of the player piano shrouded with a white sheet, Colonel Aureliano Buendía did not sit this time within the chalk circle drawn by his aides.</t2570> <t2571>He took a seat among his political advisors, and wrapped in the wool blanket, he listened in silence to the brief proposals of the emissaries.</t2571> <t2572>They asked, first and foremost, to renounce the review of land ownership titles to regain the support of the liberal landowners.</t2572> <t2573>They asked, secondly, to renounce the fight against clerical influence to obtain the backing of the Catholic populace.</t2573> <t2574>They asked, finally, to renounce the aspirations for equal rights between natural and legitimate children to preserve the integrity of households.</t2574>
<t2575>—It means —smiled Colonel Aureliano Buendía when he finished reading— that we are only fighting for power.</t2575>
<t2576>—They are tactical reforms —replied one of the delegates—.</t2576> <t2577>For now, the essential thing is to broaden the popular base of the war.</t2577> <t2578>We will see afterwards.</t2578>
<t2579>One of Colonel Aureliano Buendía's political advisors hurried to intervene.</t2579>
<t2580>—It is a contradiction —he said—.</t2580> <t2581>If these reforms are good, it means that the conservative regime is good.</t2581> <t2582>If with them we will manage to broaden the popular base of the war, as you say, it means that the regime has a wide popular base.</t2582> <t2583>It means, in summary, that for almost twenty years we have been fighting against the sentiments of the nation.</t2583>
<t2584>He was going to continue, but Colonel Aureliano Buendía interrupted him with a gesture.</t2584> <t2585>"Don't waste your time, doctor," he said.</t2585> <t2586>"The important thing is that from this moment on, we only fight for power."</t2586> <t2587>Without stopping his smile, he took the documents handed to him by the delegates and prepared to sign.</t2587>
<t2588>—Since that is the case —he concluded—, we have no objection to accepting.</t2588>
<t2589>His men looked at each other in dismay.</t2589>
<t2590>—Excuse me, Colonel —said Colonel Gerineldo Márquez softly—, but this is a betrayal.</t2590>
<t2591>Colonel Aureliano Buendía halted the inked pen in mid-air and unleashed the full weight of his authority upon him.</t2591>
<t2592>—Hand over your weapons —he ordered.</t2592>
<t2593>Colonel Gerineldo Márquez stood up and placed the weapons on the table.</t2593>
<t2594>—Present yourself at the barracks —ordered Colonel Aureliano Buendía—.</t2594> <t2595>You are at the disposal of the revolutionary courts.</t2595>
<t2596>Then he signed the declaration and handed the documents to the emissaries, saying to them:</t2596>
<t2597>—Gentlemen, here are your papers.</t2597> <t2598>Make good use of them.</t2598>
<t2599>Two days later, Colonel Gerineldo Márquez, accused of high treason, was sentenced to death.</t2599> <t2600>Collapsed in his hammock, Colonel Aureliano Buendía was indifferent to the pleas for clemency.</t2600> <t2601>The day before the execution, disobeying the order not to disturb him, Úrsula visited him in the bedroom.</t2601> <t2602>Dressed in black, invested with a rare solemnity, she stood for the three minutes of the interview.</t2602> <t2603>"I know you will execute Gerineldo," she said calmly, "and I can do nothing to prevent it.</t2603> <t2604>But I warn you of one thing: as soon as I see the corpse, I swear by the bones of my father and mother, by the memory of José Arcadio Buendía, I swear before God, that I will drag you out from wherever you hide and I will kill you with my own hands."</t2604> <t2605>Before leaving the room, without waiting for any reply, she concluded:</t2605>
<t2606>—It's the same thing I would have done if you had been born with a pig's tail.</t2606>
<t2607>That endless night, while Colonel Gerineldo Márquez recalled his dead afternoons in Amaranta's sewing room, Colonel Aureliano Buendía scratched for many hours, trying to break it, the hard shell of his solitude.</t2607> <t2608>His only happy moments, since the distant afternoon when his father took him to see the ice, had passed in the silver workshop, where he spent his time assembling little gold fish.</t2608> <t2609>He had had to wage thirty-two wars, and had had to break all his pacts with death and wallow like a pig in the mire of glory, to discover almost forty years late the privileges of simplicity.</t2609>
<t2610>At dawn, ravaged by the stormy vigil, he appeared in the stocks room an hour before the execution.</t2610> <t2611>"The farce is over, compadre," he said to Colonel Gerineldo Márquez.</t2611> <t2612>"Let's get out of here before the mosquitoes finish you off."</t2612> <t2613>Colonel Gerineldo Márquez could not repress the contempt that this attitude inspired in him.</t2613>
<t2614>—No, Aureliano —he replied—.</t2614> <t2615>It's better to be dead than to see you turned into a bully.</t2615>
<t2616>—You won't see me —said Colonel Aureliano Buendía—.</t2616> <t2617>Put on your shoes and help me finish this shitty war.</t2617>
<t2618>When he said it, he did not imagine that it was easier to start a war than to end one.</t2618> <t2619>It took almost a year of bloody rigor to force the government to propose peace conditions favorable to the rebels, and another year to persuade his supporters of the convenience of accepting them.</t2619> <t2620>He reached inconceivable extremes of cruelty to quell the rebellions of his own officers, who resisted giving up the victory, and ended up relying on enemy forces to finally subdue them.</t2620>
<t2621>Never was there a better warrior than then.</t2621> <t2622>The certainty that he was finally fighting for his own liberation, and not for abstract ideals, for slogans that politicians could twist and turn according to circumstances, infused him with a fiery enthusiasm.</t2622> <t2623>Colonel Gerineldo Márquez, who fought for failure with as much conviction and loyalty as he had previously fought for victory, reproached him for his useless recklessness.</t2623> <t2624>"Don't worry," he smiled.</t2624> <t2625>"Dying is much harder than one thinks."</t2625> <t2626>In his case, it was true.</t2626> <t2627>The certainty that his day was marked endowed him with a mysterious immunity, a fixed-term immortality that made him invulnerable to the risks of war, and finally allowed him to achieve a defeat that was much more difficult, much bloodier, and costlier than victory.</t2627>
<t2628>In almost twenty years of war, Colonel Aureliano Buendía had been in the house many times, but the state of urgency in which he always arrived, the military apparatus that accompanied him everywhere, the aura of legend that gilded his presence and to which even Úrsula herself was not insensitive, ended up making him a stranger.</t2628> <t2629>The last time he was in Macondo, and took a house for his three concubines, he was seen in his own home only two or three times, when he had time to accept invitations to eat.</t2629> <t2630>Remedios, the beautiful, and the twins, born in the midst of the war, barely knew him.</t2630> <t2631>Amaranta could not reconcile the image of the brother who spent his adolescence making little gold fishes with that of the mythical warrior who had placed a distance of three meters between himself and the rest of humanity.</t2631> <t2632>But when the proximity of the armistice became known and it was thought that he was returning once again as a human being, finally rescued for the hearts of his own, the family affections dormant for so long were reborn with more strength than ever.</t2632>
<t2633>—At last —said Úrsula— we will have a man in the house again.</t2633>
<t2634>Amaranta was the first to suspect that they had lost him forever.</t2634> <t2635>A week before the armistice, when he entered the house without an escort, preceded by two barefoot orderlies who deposited the mule's gear and the trunk of verses, the only remnant of his former imperial baggage, she saw him pass in front of the sewing room and called him.</t2635> <t2636>Colonel Aureliano Buendía seemed to have difficulty recognizing her.</t2636>
<t2637>—I am Amaranta —she said in good spirits, happy about her return, and showed him the hand with the black bandage—.</t2637> <t2638>Look.</t2638>
<t2639>Colonel Aureliano Buendía gave her the same smile as the first time he saw her with the bandage, that distant morning when he returned to Macondo sentenced to death.</t2639>
<t2640>—What a horror —he said—, how time flies!</t2640>
<t2641>The regular army had to protect the house.</t2641> <t2642>He arrived harassed, spat upon, accused of having intensified the war only to sell it at a higher price.</t2642> <t2643>He was trembling with fever and cold and once again had his armpits full of boils.</t2643> <t2644>Six months earlier, when she heard about the armistice, Úrsula had opened and swept the bridal chamber, and had burned myrrh in the corners, thinking that he would return ready to grow old slowly among Remedios's moldy dolls.</t2644> <t2645>But in reality, in the last two years, he had paid his final dues to life, including that of aging.</t2645> <t2646>As he passed in front of the silver workshop, which Úrsula had prepared with special diligence, he did not even notice that the keys were in the lock.</t2646> <t2647>He did not perceive the tiny and heartbreaking damages that time had done to the house, and that after such a prolonged absence would have seemed a disaster to any man who kept his memories alive.</t2647> <t2648>The peeling lime on the walls did not hurt him, nor the dirty cottons of cobwebs in the corners, nor the dust on the begonias, nor the termite veins in the beams, nor the moss on the doorframes, nor any of the insidious traps that nostalgia laid for him.</t2648> <t2649>He sat in the corridor, wrapped in the blanket and without taking off his boots, as if just waiting for the rain to stop, and spent the whole afternoon watching it rain over the begonias.</t2649> <t2650>Úrsula then understood that she would not have him in the house for long.</t2650> <t2651>"If it's not the war," she thought, "it can only be death."</t2651> <t2652>It was such a clear, convincing supposition that she identified it as a premonition.</t2652>
<t2653>That night, at dinner, the supposed Aureliano Segundo crumbled the bread with his right hand and took the soup with his left.</t2653> <t2654>His twin brother, the supposed José Arcadio Segundo, crumbled the bread with his left hand and took the soup with his right.</t2654> <t2655>The coordination of their movements was so precise that they did not seem like two brothers sitting across from each other, but rather an artifice of mirrors.</t2655> <t2656>The spectacle that the twins had conceived since they became aware of being identical was repeated in honor of the newcomer.</t2656> <t2657>But Colonel Aureliano Buendía did not notice it.</t2657> <t2658>He seemed so oblivious to everything that he didn't even notice Remedios the Beauty, who walked naked towards the bedroom.</t2658> <t2659>Úrsula was the only one who dared to disturb his abstraction.</t2659>
<t2660>—If you have to leave again —he told her halfway through dinner—, at least try to remember how we were tonight.</t2660>
<t2661>Then Colonel Aureliano Buendía realized, without surprise, that Úrsula was the only human being who had managed to unravel his misery, and for the first time in many years, he dared to look her in the face.</t2661> <t2662>She had cracked skin, decayed teeth, withered and colorless hair, and an astonished look.</t2662> <t2663>He compared her with the oldest memory he had of her, the afternoon when he had the premonition that a pot of boiling broth was going to fall off the table, and he found her shattered.</t2663> <t2664>In an instant, he discovered the scratches, welts, bruises, ulcers, and scars that more than half a century of daily life had left on her, and he confirmed that these ravages did not even evoke a feeling of pity in him.</t2664> <t2665>He then made one last effort to search in his heart for the place where his affections had rotted away, and he could not find it.</t2665> <t2666>In another time, at least he experienced a confused feeling of shame when he detected Úrsula's smell on his own skin, and on more than one occasion, he felt his thoughts interfered by hers.</t2666> <t2667>But all that had been swept away by the war.</t2667> <t2668>Even Remedios, his wife, was at that moment the blurred image of someone who could have been his daughter.</t2668> <t2669>The countless women he had known in the desert of love, and who had scattered his seed all along the coast, had left no trace in his feelings.</t2669> <t2670>Most of them entered the room in the dark and left before dawn, and the next day they were barely a bit of tedium in his bodily memory.</t2670> <t2671>The only affection that prevailed against time and war was the one he felt for his brother José Arcadio when they were both children, and it was not founded on love, but on complicity.</t2671>
<t2672>—Excuse me —he apologized at Úrsula's request—.</t2672> <t2673>It's just that this war has ended everything.</t2673>
<t2674>In the following days, he occupied himself with destroying every trace of his passage through the world.</t2674> <t2675>He simplified the silversmith workshop until only impersonal objects were left, gave his clothes to the orderlies, and buried his weapons in the yard with the same sense of penance with which his father buried the spear that killed Prudencio Aguilar.</t2675> <t2676>He only kept one pistol, and with a single bullet.</t2676> <t2677>Úrsula did not intervene.</t2677> <t2678>The only time she dissuaded him was when he was about to destroy the daguerreotype of Remedios that was kept in the living room, illuminated by an eternal lamp.</t2678> <t2679>"That portrait stopped belonging to you a long time ago," she told him.</t2679> <t2680>"It is a family relic."</t2680> <t2681>On the eve of the armistice, when there was not a single object left in the house that could remind anyone of him, he took the trunk with the verses to the bakery at the moment when Santa Sofía de la Piedad was preparing to light the oven.</t2681>
<t2682>—Light it with this —he said, handing him the first roll of yellowed papers—.</t2682> <t2683>It burns better because they are very old things.</t2683>
<t2684>Santa Sofía de la Piedad, the silent one, the accommodating one, the one who never contradicted even her own children, had the impression that this was a forbidden act.</t2684>
<t2685>—They are important papers —he said.</t2685>
<t2686>—None of that —said the colonel—.</t2686> <t2687>These are things that are written for oneself.</t2687>
<t2688>—Then —she said— burn them yourself, Colonel.</t2688>
<t2689>Not only did he do it, but he also smashed the trunk with a hatchet and threw the splinters into the fire.</t2689> <t2690>Hours earlier, Pilar Ternera had come to visit him.</t2690> <t2691>After so many years of not seeing her, Colonel Aureliano Buendía was astonished at how much she had aged and gained weight, and how much the splendor of her laughter had faded, but he was also amazed at the depth she had achieved in reading the cards.</t2691> <t2692>"Take care of your mouth," she told him, and he wondered if the last time she said it, at the height of his glory, it had been a surprisingly foresighted vision of his destiny.</t2692> <t2693>Shortly after, when his personal doctor finished removing the boils, he asked him without showing particular interest where exactly the heart was located.</t2693> <t2694>The doctor examined him and then drew a circle on his chest with a cotton swab stained with iodine.</t2694>
<t2695>The armistice Tuesday dawned warm and rainy.</t2695> <t2696>Colonel Aureliano Buendía appeared in the kitchen before five and took his usual coffee without sugar.</t2696> <t2697>“A day like this you came into the world,” Úrsula told him.</t2697> <t2698>“Everyone was scared by your open eyes.”</t2698> <t2699>He paid no attention to her, because he was focused on the troop preparations, the bugle calls, and the commands that spoiled the dawn.</t2699> <t2700>Although after so many years of war they should have seemed familiar to him, this time he experienced the same weakness in his knees and the same tingling of the skin that he had felt in his youth in the presence of a naked woman.</t2700> <t2701>He thought confusedly, finally caught in a trap of nostalgia, that perhaps if he had married her he would have been a man without war and without glory, an anonymous craftsman, a happy animal.</t2701> <t2702>This late shudder, which was not in his plans, soured his breakfast.</t2702> <t2703>At seven in the morning, when Colonel Gerineldo Márquez came to fetch him accompanied by a group of rebel officers, he found him more taciturn than ever, more thoughtful and solitary.</t2703> <t2704>Úrsula tried to throw a new blanket over his shoulders.</t2704> <t2705>“What will the government think,” she said to him.</t2705> <t2706>“They will imagine that you have surrendered because you no longer had even enough to buy a blanket.”</t2706> <t2707>But he did not accept it.</t2707> <t2708>Already at the door, seeing that the rain continued, he let them put an old felt hat of José Arcadio Buendía on him.</t2708>
<t2709>—Aureliano —Úrsula then said to him—, promise me that if you ever encounter a bad moment out there, you will think of your mother.</t2709>
<t2710>He gave her a distant smile, raised his hand with all his fingers extended, and without saying a word, left the house and faced the shouts, insults, and blasphemies that would pursue him until he left the town.</t2710> <t2711>Úrsula bolted the door, determined not to remove it for the rest of her life.</t2711> <t2712>“We will rot in here,” she thought.</t2712> <t2713>“We will turn to ashes in this house without men, but we will not give this miserable town the pleasure of seeing us cry.”</t2713> <t2714>She spent the whole morning looking for a memory of her son in the most secret corners, and she could not find it.</t2714>
<t2715>The event was held twenty kilometers from Macondo, in the shadow of a gigantic ceiba tree around which the town of Neerlandia would later be founded.</t2715> <t2716>The government and party delegates, and the rebel commission that surrendered their weapons, were served by a bustling group of novices in white habits, who looked like a flutter of doves frightened by the rain.</t2716> <t2717>Colonel Aureliano Buendía arrived on a mud-splattered mule.</t2717> <t2718>He was unshaven, more tormented by the pain of his boils than by the immense failure of his dreams, for he had reached the end of all hope, beyond glory and the nostalgia for glory.</t2718> <t2719>In accordance with his own instructions, there was no music, no fireworks, no joyful bells, no cheers, nor any other manifestation that could alter the mournful character of the armistice.</t2719> <t2720>A traveling photographer, who took the only portrait of him that could have been preserved, was forced to destroy the plates without developing them.</t2720>
<t2721>The act lasted just long enough for the signatures to be affixed.</t2721> <t2722>Around the rustic table placed in the center of a patched circus tent, where the delegates sat, were the last officers who remained loyal to Colonel Aureliano Buendía.</t2722> <t2723>Before taking the signatures, the personal delegate of the president of the republic tried to read the act of surrender aloud, but Colonel Aureliano Buendía objected.</t2723> <t2724>"Let's not waste time on formalities," he said, and proceeded to sign the documents without reading them.</t2724> <t2725>One of his officers then broke the soporific silence of the tent.</t2725>
<t2726>—Colonel —he said—, do us the favor of not being the first to sign.</t2726>
<t2727>Colonel Aureliano Buendía agreed.</t2727> <t2728>When the document had made a full round of the table, in the midst of a silence so clear that the signatures could have been deciphered by the scratching of the pen on the paper, the first spot was still blank.</t2728> <t2729>Colonel Aureliano Buendía prepared to occupy it.</t2729>
<t2730>—Colonel —said then another of his officers—, you still have time to make things right.</t2730>
<t2731>Without flinching, Colonel Aureliano Buendía signed the first copy.</t2731> <t2732>He had not finished signing the last one when a rebel colonel appeared at the tent door, leading a mule loaded with two trunks by the halter.</t2732> <t2733>Despite his extreme youth, he had a harsh appearance and a patient expression.</t2733> <t2734>He was the treasurer of the revolution in the Macondo district.</t2734> <t2735>He had made a painful six-day journey, dragging the starving mule, to arrive in time for the armistice.</t2735> <t2736>With exasperating slowness, he unloaded the trunks, opened them, and began placing on the table, one by one, seventy-two gold bricks.</t2736> <t2737>No one remembered the existence of that fortune.</t2737> <t2738>In the disorder of the last year, when the central command fell apart and the revolution degenerated into a bloody rivalry of warlords, it was impossible to determine any responsibility.</t2738> <t2739>The gold of the rebellion, melted into blocks that were later covered with baked clay, was beyond any control.</t2739> <t2740>Colonel Aureliano Buendía had the seventy-two gold bricks included in the surrender inventory and closed the act without allowing any speeches.</t2740> <t2741>The scrawny adolescent remained in front of him, looking into his eyes with his serene honey-colored eyes.</t2741>
<t2742>—Anything else? —Colonel Aureliano Buendía asked him.</t2742>
<t2743>The young colonel clenched his teeth.</t2743>
<t2744>—The receipt —he said.</t2744>
<t2745>Colonel Aureliano Buendía handed it over in his own handwriting.</t2745> <t2746>Then he took a glass of lemonade and a piece of cake that the novices distributed, and retired to a tent that had been prepared for him in case he wanted to rest.</t2746> <t2747>There he took off his shirt, sat on the edge of the cot, and at three fifteen in the afternoon he shot himself with a pistol in the circle of iodine that his personal doctor had painted on his chest.</t2747> <t2748>At that hour, in Macondo, Úrsula uncovered the pot of milk on the stove, puzzled that it was taking so long to boil, and found it full of worms.</t2748>
<t2749>—They have killed Aureliano! —he exclaimed.</t2749>
<t2750>He looked toward the courtyard, following a habit born of his solitude, and then he saw José Arcadio Buendía soaked, sad from the rain, and much older than when he died.</t2750> <t2751>"They killed him treacherously," Úrsula specified, "and no one did him the kindness of closing his eyes."</t2751> <t2752>At dusk, through his tears, he saw the swift and luminous orange discs that crossed the sky like a breath, and he thought they were a sign of death.</t2752> <t2753>He was still under the chestnut tree, sobbing on his husband's knees, when they brought Colonel Aureliano Buendía wrapped in the stiff blanket of dried blood and with eyes wide open in rage.</t2753>
<t2754>He was out of danger.</t2754> <t2755>The projectile followed such a clean trajectory that the doctor inserted a cord soaked in iodine through his chest and pulled it out through his back.</t2755> <t2756>“This is my masterpiece,” he said, satisfied.</t2756> <t2757>“It was the only spot where a bullet could pass without harming any vital center.”</t2757> <t2758>Colonel Aureliano Buendía found himself surrounded by merciful nuns who chanted desperate psalms for the eternal rest of his soul, and then he regretted not having shot himself in the palate as he had planned, just to defy Pilar Ternera's prediction.</t2758>
<t2759>—If I still had any authority left —he told the doctor—, I would have him shot without a trial.</t2759> <t2760>Not to save my life, but to make me look ridiculous.</t2760>
<t2761>The failure of death restored his lost prestige in a few hours.</t2761><t2762>The same people who invented the lie that he had sold the war for a room whose walls were made of gold bricks, defined the suicide attempt as an act of honor, and proclaimed him a martyr.</t2762><t2763>Later, when he rejected the Order of Merit awarded to him by the president of the republic, even his most bitter rivals paraded through his room asking him to disregard the terms of the armistice and promote a new war.</t2763><t2764>The house was filled with gifts of reparation.</t2764><t2765>Belatedly impressed by the massive support of his former comrades-in-arms, Colonel Aureliano Buendía did not rule out the possibility of pleasing them.</t2765><t2766>On the contrary, at one point he seemed so enthusiastic about the idea of a new war that Colonel Gerineldo Márquez thought he was only waiting for a pretext to proclaim it.</t2766><t2767>The pretext was indeed offered to him when the president of the republic refused to assign war pensions to former combatants, whether liberal or conservative, unless each file was reviewed by a special commission and the allocation law approved by congress.</t2767><t2768>"This is an outrage," thundered Colonel Aureliano Buendía.</t2768><t2769>"They will die of old age waiting for the mail."</t2769><t2770>For the first time, he abandoned the rocking chair that Úrsula had bought for his convalescence, and pacing around the room, he dictated a decisive message to the president of the republic.</t2770><t2771>In that telegram, which was never published, he denounced the first violation of the Treaty of Neerlandia and threatened to proclaim a war to the death if the allocation of pensions was not resolved within fifteen days.</t2771><t2772>His stance was so just that it even allowed for the expectation of support from former conservative combatants.</t2772><t2773>But the only response from the government was the reinforcement of the military guard that had been placed at the door of the house, under the pretext of protecting it, and the prohibition of all kinds of visits.</t2773><t2774>Similar measures were adopted throughout the country with other troublesome leaders.</t2774><t2775>It was such a timely, drastic, and effective operation that two months after the armistice, when Colonel Aureliano Buendía was discharged, his most determined instigators were either dead, exiled, or had been permanently assimilated into the public administration.</t2775>
<t2776>Colonel Aureliano Buendía left the room in December, and it only took a glance at the corridor for him to never think about the war again.</t2776> <t2777>With a vitality that seemed impossible for her age, Úrsula had rejuvenated the house once more.</t2777> <t2778>“Now you will see who I am,” she said when she learned that her son would live.</t2778> <t2779>“There won't be a better house, nor one more open to everyone, than this house of crazies.”</t2779> <t2780>She had it washed and painted, changed the furniture, restored the garden and planted new flowers, and opened doors and windows so that the dazzling summer light would reach even the bedrooms.</t2780> <t2781>She decreed the end of the numerous overlapping mourning periods, and she herself changed the old strict outfits for youthful clothes.</t2781> <t2782>The music of the player piano once again brought joy to the house.</t2782> <t2783>Upon hearing it, Amaranta remembered Pietro Crespi, his twilight gardenia and lavender scent, and in the depths of her withered heart, a clean resentment, purified by time, blossomed.</t2783> <t2784>One afternoon, while trying to bring order to the living room, Úrsula asked the soldiers guarding the house for help.</t2784> <t2785>The young commander of the guard granted them permission.</t2785> <t2786>Little by little, Úrsula assigned them new tasks.</t2786> <t2787>She invited them to eat, gave them clothes and shoes, and taught them to read and write.</t2787> <t2788>When the government suspended the surveillance, one of them stayed living in the house and served her for many years.</t2788> <t2789>On New Year's Day, driven mad by the slights of Remedios the Beauty, the young commander of the guard was found dead from love by her window at dawn.</t2789>
<t2790>Years later, on his deathbed, Aureliano Segundo would remember the rainy June afternoon when he entered the bedroom to meet his first child.</t2790> <t2791>Although he was languid and crying, without any features of a Buendía, he did not have to think twice to name him.</t2791>
<t2792>—He will be called José Arcadio —he said.</t2792>
<t2793>Fernanda del Carpio, the beautiful woman he had married the previous year, agreed.</t2793> <t2794>On the other hand, Úrsula could not hide a vague feeling of unease.</t2794> <t2795>In the long history of the family, the persistent repetition of names had allowed her to draw conclusions that seemed definitive to her.</t2795> <t2796>While the Aurelianos were withdrawn but of clear mind, the José Arcadios were impulsive and enterprising, but they were marked by a tragic sign.</t2796> <t2797>The only cases of impossible classification were those of José Arcadio Segundo and Aureliano Segundo.</t2797> <t2798>They were so similar and mischievous during childhood that not even Santa Sofía de la Piedad herself could distinguish them.</t2798> <t2799>On the day of the baptism, Amaranta put bracelets on them with their respective names and dressed them in different colored clothes marked with each one's initials, but when they started attending school, they opted to switch clothes and bracelets and call themselves by the crossed names.</t2799> <t2800>Teacher Melchor Escalona, accustomed to knowing José Arcadio Segundo by his green shirt, lost his temper when he discovered that this one had Aureliano Segundo's bracelet, and that the other claimed to be Aureliano Segundo despite wearing the white shirt and the bracelet marked with the name José Arcadio Segundo.</t2800> <t2801>From then on, it was not known for certain who was who.</t2801> <t2802>Even when they grew up and life made them different, Úrsula kept wondering if they themselves had made a mistake at some point in their intricate game of confusions and had remained switched forever.</t2802> <t2803>Until the beginning of adolescence, they were two synchronous mechanisms.</t2803> <t2804>They woke up at the same time, felt the need to go to the bathroom at the same hour, suffered the same health disorders, and even dreamed the same things.</t2804> <t2805>In the house, where it was believed they coordinated their actions simply to confuse, no one realized the reality until one day when Santa Sofía de la Piedad gave one a glass of lemonade, and he no sooner tasted it than the other said it lacked sugar.</t2805> <t2806>Santa Sofía de la Piedad, who had indeed forgotten to put sugar in the lemonade, told Úrsula about it.</t2806> <t2807>“That's how they all are,” she said, without surprise.</t2807> <t2808>“Crazy from birth.”</t2808> <t2809>Time finished disorganizing things.</t2809> <t2810>The one who, in the games of confusion, kept the name Aureliano Segundo became monumental like the grandfather, and the one who kept the name José Arcadio Segundo became bony like the colonel, and the only thing they retained in common was the solitary air of the family.</t2810> <t2811>Perhaps it was this crossing of statures, names, and characters that made Úrsula suspect they had been switched since childhood.</t2811>
<t2812>The decisive difference was revealed in the midst of the war when José Arcadio Segundo asked Colonel Gerineldo Márquez to take him to see the executions.</t2812> <t2813>Against Úrsula's opinion, his wishes were granted.</t2813> <t2814>Aureliano Segundo, on the other hand, shuddered at the mere idea of witnessing an execution.</t2814> <t2815>He preferred the house.</t2815> <t2816>At twelve years old, he asked Úrsula what was in the locked room.</t2816> <t2817>"Papers," she replied.</t2817> <t2818>"They are Melquíades' books and the strange things he wrote in his later years."</t2818> <t2819>The answer, instead of calming him, increased his curiosity.</t2819> <t2820>He insisted so much, promised so earnestly not to damage anything, that Úrsula gave him the keys.</t2820> <t2821>No one had entered the room again since they had taken out Melquíades' corpse and put a lock on the door whose pieces had fused with rust.</t2821> <t2822>But when Aureliano Segundo opened the windows, a familiar light entered that seemed accustomed to illuminating the room every day, and there was not the slightest trace of dust or cobwebs; everything was swept and clean, better swept and cleaner than on the day of the burial, and the ink had not dried in the inkwell, nor had rust altered the shine of the metals, nor had the embers of the furnace where José Arcadio Buendía vaporized mercury extinguished.</t2822> <t2823>On the shelves were books bound in a cardboard-like material, pale like tanned human skin, and the manuscripts were intact.</t2823> <t2824>Despite the many years of confinement, the air seemed purer than in the rest of the house.</t2824> <t2825>Everything was so recent that several weeks later, when Úrsula entered the room with a bucket of water and a broom to wash the floors, she had nothing to do.</t2825> <t2826>Aureliano Segundo was absorbed in reading a book.</t2826> <t2827>Although it lacked covers and the title did not appear anywhere, the boy enjoyed the story of a woman who sat at the table and only ate grains of rice that she picked up with pins, and the story of the fisherman who borrowed a lead weight for his net from his neighbor and the fish with which he later repaid him had a diamond in its stomach, and the lamp that granted wishes and the flying carpets.</t2827> <t2828>Astonished, he asked Úrsula if all that was true, and she replied that yes, many years ago the gypsies brought wonderful lamps and flying rugs to Macondo.</t2828>
<t2829>—What happens —he sighed— is that the world is gradually ending and those things no longer come.</t2829>
<t2830>When he finished the book, many of whose stories were incomplete because pages were missing, Aureliano Segundo set about deciphering the manuscripts.</t2830> <t2831>It was impossible.</t2831> <t2832>The letters looked like clothes hung out to dry on a wire, and they resembled musical notation more than literary writing.</t2832> <t2833>One scorching midday, while he was scrutinizing the manuscripts, he felt he was not alone in the room.</t2833> <t2834>Against the glare of the window, sitting with his hands on his knees, was Melquíades.</t2834> <t2835>He was no more than forty years old.</t2835> <t2836>He wore the same anachronistic vest and the raven-winged hat, and the grease from his hair, melted by the heat, dripped down his pale temples, just as Aureliano and José Arcadio had seen when they were children.</t2836> <t2837>Aureliano Segundo recognized him immediately, because that hereditary memory had been passed down from generation to generation, and had reached him from his grandfather's memory.</t2837>
<t2838>—Cheers —said Aureliano Segundo.</t2838>
<t2839>—Greetings, young man —said Melquíades.</t2839>
<t2840>Since then, for several years, they saw each other almost every afternoon.</t2840> <t2841>Melquíades spoke to him about the world, tried to instill his old wisdom in him, but refused to translate the manuscripts.</t2841> <t2842>“No one should know their meaning until a hundred years have passed,” he explained.</t2842> <t2843>Aureliano Segundo kept the secret of those meetings forever.</t2843> <t2844>On one occasion he felt that his private world was collapsing, because Úrsula entered just as Melquíades was in the room.</t2844> <t2845>But she did not see him.</t2845>
<t2846>—Who are you talking to? —he asked her.</t2846>
<t2847>—With no one —said Aureliano Segundo.</t2847>
<t2848>—That was your great-grandfather —said Úrsula—.</t2848> <t2849>He also talked to himself.</t2849>
<t2850>José Arcadio Segundo, meanwhile, had fulfilled the illusion of witnessing an execution.</t2850> <t2851>For the rest of his life, he would remember the livid flash of the six simultaneous shots and the echo of the blast that shattered through the mountains, and the sad smile and perplexed eyes of the executed man, who remained upright while his shirt was soaked with blood, and who continued smiling even when they untied him from the post and put him in a box full of lime.</t2851> <t2852>“He is alive,” he thought.</t2852> <t2853>“They are going to bury him alive.”</t2853> <t2854>He was so impressed that from then on he detested military practices and war, not because of the executions but because of the dreadful habit of burying the executed alive.</t2854> <t2855>No one knew then at what moment he began to ring the bells in the tower, to assist Father Antonio Isabel, successor of El Cachorro, at mass, and to care for fighting cocks in the courtyard of the parish house.</t2855> <t2856>When Colonel Gerineldo Márquez found out, he harshly reprimanded him for learning trades despised by the liberals.</t2856> <t2857>“The thing is,” he replied, “it seems to me that I have turned out to be a conservative.”</t2857> <t2858>He believed it as if it were a determination of fate.</t2858> <t2859>Colonel Gerineldo Márquez, scandalized, told Úrsula about it.</t2859>
<t2860>—Better —she approved—.</t2860> <t2861>I hope he becomes a priest, so that God finally enters this house.</t2861>
<t2862>Very soon it was known that Father Antonio Isabel was preparing him for his first communion.</t2862> <t2863>He taught him the catechism while shaving the necks of the roosters.</t2863> <t2864>He explained with simple examples, while placing the broody hens in their nests, how God thought on the second day of creation that chicks should form inside the egg.</t2864> <t2865>Since then, the parish priest showed the first symptoms of the senile delirium that led him to say, years later, that probably the devil had won the rebellion against God, and that it was he who was sitting on the heavenly throne, without revealing his true identity to trap the unwary.</t2865> <t2866>Fired up by the boldness of his preceptor, José Arcadio Segundo became in a few months as skilled in theological tricks to confuse the devil as he was in the tricks of the cockpit.</t2866> <t2867>Amaranta made him a linen suit with a collar and tie, bought him a pair of white shoes, and engraved his name in gold letters on the ribbon of the candle.</t2867> <t2868>Two nights before the first communion, Father Antonio Isabel locked himself up with him in the sacristy to confess him, with the help of a dictionary of sins.</t2868> <t2869>It was such a long list that the elderly parish priest, used to going to bed at six, fell asleep in the chair before finishing.</t2869> <t2870>The interrogation was a revelation for José Arcadio Segundo.</t2870> <t2871>He was not surprised that the father asked him if he had done bad things with women, and he honestly answered no, but he was puzzled by the question of whether he had done them with animals.</t2871> <t2872>On the first Friday of May, he took communion tortured by curiosity.</t2872> <t2873>Later he asked the question to Petronio, the sick sacristan who lived in the tower and who, according to rumors, fed on bats, and Petronio answered him: "It’s because there are corrupted Christians who do their things with donkeys."</t2873> <t2874>José Arcadio Segundo continued to show so much curiosity, asked so many questions, that Petronio lost his patience.</t2874>
<t2875>—I go on Tuesday nights —he confessed—.</t2875> <t2876>If you promise not to tell anyone, I'll take you next Tuesday.</t2876>
<t2877>On the following Tuesday, indeed, Petronio came down from the tower with a small wooden bench that no one had known what it was for until then, and took José Arcadio Segundo to a nearby orchard.</t2877> <t2878>The boy became so fond of those nocturnal excursions that a long time passed before he was seen again in Catarino's store.</t2878> <t2879>He became a rooster man.</t2879> <t2880>"Take those animals somewhere else," Úrsula ordered him the first time she saw him enter with his fine fighting animals.</t2880> <t2881>"Roosters have already brought too much bitterness to this house for you to bring us more now."</t2881> <t2882>José Arcadio Segundo took them away without argument, but continued raising them at Pilar Ternera's, his grandmother, who provided him with everything he needed in exchange for having him in the house.</t2882> <t2883>Soon he demonstrated in the cockfighting ring the wisdom that Father Antonio Isabel had instilled in him, and had enough money not only to enrich his breeds but also to procure himself the satisfactions of a man.</t2883> <t2884>At that time, Úrsula compared him to his brother and could not understand how the two twins, who had seemed like one person in their childhood, had ended up being so different.</t2884> <t2885>The perplexity did not last long, because very soon Aureliano Segundo began to show signs of laziness and dissipation.</t2885> <t2886>While he was locked up in Melquíades' room, he was a self-absorbed man, as Colonel Aureliano Buendía had been in his youth.</t2886> <t2887>But shortly before the Treaty of Neerlandia, a coincidence took him out of his self-absorption and confronted him with the reality of the world.</t2887> <t2888>A young woman, who was selling tickets for the raffle of an accordion, greeted him very familiarly.</t2888> <t2889>Aureliano Segundo was not surprised because it often happened that he was mistaken for his brother.</t2889> <t2890>But he did not clarify the misunderstanding, not even when the girl tried to soften his heart with whimpering, and ended up taking him to her room.</t2890> <t2891>She became so fond of him from that first encounter that she cheated in the raffle so that he would win the accordion.</t2891> <t2892>After two weeks, Aureliano Segundo realized that the woman had been sleeping alternately with him and his brother, believing they were the same man, and instead of clarifying the situation, he managed to prolong it.</t2892> <t2893>He did not return to Melquíades' room.</t2893> <t2894>He spent the afternoons in the courtyard, learning to play the accordion by ear, against Úrsula's protests, who at that time had banned music in the house because of mourning, and who also despised the accordion as an instrument fit for the vagabond heirs of Francisco the Man.</t2894> <t2895>However, Aureliano Segundo became a virtuoso of the accordion and remained so even after he got married, had children, and became one of the most respected men in Macondo.</t2895>
<t2896>For almost two months, the woman shared with her brother.</t2896> <t2897>She watched over him, disrupted his plans, and when she was sure that José Arcadio Segundo would not visit their common lover that night, she went to sleep with her.</t2897> <t2898>One morning, she discovered that he was sick.</t2898> <t2899>Two days later, she found her brother clinging to a beam in the bathroom, drenched in sweat and crying his heart out, and then she understood.</t2899> <t2900>Her brother confessed to her that the woman had rejected him for bringing her what she called a disease of the bad life.</t2900> <t2901>He also told her how Pilar Ternera was trying to cure him.</t2901> <t2902>Aureliano Segundo secretly submitted to the burning permanganate washes and diuretic waters, and both were cured separately after three months of secret suffering.</t2902> <t2903>José Arcadio Segundo never saw the woman again.</t2903> <t2904>Aureliano Segundo obtained her forgiveness and stayed with her until death.</t2904>
<t2905>Her name was Petra Cotes.</t2905> <t2906>She had arrived in Macondo in the midst of the war, with a casual husband who lived off raffles, and when the man died, she continued with the business.</t2906> <t2907>She was a clean and young mulatto woman, with yellow almond-shaped eyes that gave her face the ferocity of a panther, but she had a generous heart and a magnificent vocation for love.</t2907> <t2908>When Úrsula realized that José Arcadio Segundo was a cockfighter and Aureliano Segundo played the accordion at his concubine's noisy parties, she thought she would go mad with confusion.</t2908> <t2909>It was as if both had concentrated the family's defects and none of its virtues.</t2909> <t2910>Then she decided that no one would be named Aureliano or José Arcadio again.</t2910> <t2911>However, when Aureliano Segundo had his first child, she did not dare to contradict him.</t2911>
<t2912>—Agreed —said Úrsula—, but with one condition: I will take care of raising him.</t2912>
<t2913>Although she was already a centenarian and was about to go blind from cataracts, she retained her physical dynamism, integrity of character, and mental balance intact.</t2913> <t2914>No one better than her to shape the virtuous man who was to restore the family's prestige, a man who would never have heard of war, fighting cocks, women of ill repute, and delirious enterprises, four calamities that, according to Úrsula, had determined the decline of her lineage.</t2914> <t2915>"He will be a priest," she promised solemnly.</t2915> <t2916>"And if God gives me life, he will become Pope."</t2916> <t2917>Everyone laughed upon hearing her, not only in the bedroom but throughout the house, where Aureliano Segundo's boisterous friends were gathered.</t2917> <t2918>The war, relegated to the attic of bad memories, was momentarily evoked with the popping of champagne corks.</t2918>
<t2919>—To the health of the Pope —Aureliano Segundo toasted.</t2919>
<t2920>The guests toasted in unison.</t2920> <t2921>Then the host played the accordion, fireworks exploded, and drums of jubilation were ordered for the town.</t2921> <t2922>In the early morning, the guests, soaked in champagne, sacrificed six cows and put them in the street for the crowd to take.</t2922> <t2923>Nobody was scandalized.</t2923> <t2924>Since Aureliano Segundo took charge of the house, those festivities were commonplace, even if there wasn't a reason as just as the birth of a Pope.</t2924> <t2925>In a few years, without effort, purely by strokes of luck, he had accumulated one of the greatest fortunes in the swamp, thanks to the supernatural proliferation of his animals.</t2925> <t2926>His mares gave birth to triplets, the hens laid eggs twice a day, and the pigs fattened with such frenzy that no one could explain such chaotic fertility, except by magic arts.</t2926> <t2927>“Save now,” Úrsula would tell her scatterbrained great-grandson.</t2927> <t2928>“This luck won't last you a lifetime.”</t2928> <t2929>But Aureliano Segundo paid her no attention.</t2929> <t2930>The more champagne he uncorked to soak his friends, the more wildly his animals reproduced, and the more convinced he became that his good fortune was not due to his behavior but to the influence of Petra Cotes, his concubine, whose love had the virtue of exasperating nature.</t2930> <t2931>He was so persuaded that this was the origin of his fortune that he never kept Petra Cotes away from his offspring, and even when he married and had children, he continued living with her with Fernanda's consent.</t2931> <t2932>Solid, monumental like his grandparents, but with a vital joy and an irresistible charm that they did not have, Aureliano Segundo barely had time to oversee his herds.</t2932> <t2933>It was enough for him to take Petra Cotes to his breeding grounds and ride her on horseback through his lands for every animal marked with his brand to succumb to the irremediable plague of proliferation.</t2933>
<t2934>Like all the good things that happened to them in their long life, that unbridled fortune originated from chance.</t2934> <t2935>Until the end of the wars, Petra Cotes continued to support herself with the proceeds from her raffles, and Aureliano Segundo managed to occasionally raid Úrsula's piggy banks.</t2935> <t2936>They formed a frivolous couple, with no other concerns than going to bed every night, even on forbidden dates, and frolicking in bed until dawn.</t2936> <t2937>“That woman has been your downfall,” Úrsula would shout at her great-grandson when she saw him enter the house like a sleepwalker.</t2937> <t2938>“She has you so bewitched that one of these days I'll see you writhing in colic, with a toad inside your belly.”</t2938> <t2939>José Arcadio Segundo, who took a long time to discover the substitution, could not understand his brother's passion.</t2939> <t2940>He remembered Petra Cotes as a conventional woman, rather lazy in bed, and completely devoid of resources for love.</t2940> <t2941>Deaf to Úrsula's clamor and his brother's taunts, Aureliano Segundo only thought then of finding a job that would allow him to support a house for Petra Cotes, and die with her, on her, and under her, in a night of feverish excess.</t2941> <t2942>When Colonel Aureliano Buendía reopened the workshop, finally seduced by the peaceful charms of old age, Aureliano Segundo thought it would be a good business to dedicate himself to making little gold fishes.</t2942> <t2943>He spent many hours in the hot little room watching how the hard metal sheets, worked by the colonel with the inconceivable patience of disappointment, gradually turned into golden scales.</t2943> <t2944>The trade seemed so laborious to him, and the memory of Petra Cotes was so persistent and pressing, that after three weeks he disappeared from the workshop.</t2944> <t2945>It was during that time that Petra Cotes took to raffling rabbits.</t2945> <t2946>They reproduced and became adults so quickly that there was barely time to sell the raffle numbers.</t2946> <t2947>At first, Aureliano Segundo did not notice the alarming proportions of the proliferation.</t2947> <t2948>But one night, when no one in town wanted to hear about rabbit raffles anymore, he heard a crash against the patio wall.</t2948> <t2949>“Don't be scared,” said Petra Cotes.</t2949> <t2950>“It's the rabbits.”</t2950> <t2951>They could not sleep anymore, tormented by the hustle of the animals.</t2951> <t2952>At dawn, Aureliano Segundo opened the door and saw the patio paved with rabbits, blue in the glow of dawn.</t2952> <t2953>Petra Cotes, laughing her head off, could not resist the temptation to play a joke on him.</t2953>
<t2954>—These are the ones who were born last night —he said.</t2954>
<t2955>—What a horror! —he said—.</t2955> <t2956>Why don't you try with cows?</t2956>
<t2957>A few days later, trying to clear out her yard, Petra Cotes traded the rabbits for a cow, which two months later gave birth to triplets.</t2957> <t2958>That's how things started.</t2958> <t2959>Overnight, Aureliano Segundo became the owner of lands and livestock, and he barely had time to expand the overflowing stables and pigsties.</t2959> <t2960>It was a delirious prosperity that made him laugh, and he couldn't help but adopt extravagant attitudes to release his good humor.</t2960> <t2961>"Move aside, cows, life is short," he shouted.</t2961> <t2962>Úrsula wondered what kind of trouble he had gotten into, if he was stealing, if he had ended up becoming a cattle rustler, and every time she saw him popping champagne just for the pleasure of pouring the foam over his head, she would loudly reproach him for the waste.</t2962> <t2963>She bothered him so much that one day, when Aureliano Segundo woke up in an overflowing good mood, he appeared with a box of money, a can of paste, and a brush, and singing at the top of his lungs the old songs of Francisco the Man, he wallpapered the house inside and out, from top to bottom, with one-peso bills.</t2963> <t2964>The old mansion, painted white since the time they brought the pianola, took on the ambiguous appearance of a mosque.</t2964> <t2965>Amid the family's uproar, Úrsula's scandal, and the town's jubilation that crowded the street to witness the glorification of waste, Aureliano Segundo ended up wallpapering from the facade to the kitchen, including the bathrooms and bedrooms, and threw the leftover bills in the yard.</t2965>
<t2966>—Now —he finally said— I hope no one in this house talks to me about money again.</t2966>
<t2967>That's how it was.</t2967> <t2968>Úrsula had the bills removed from the large cakes of lime and repainted the house white.</t2968> <t2969>"My God," she pleaded.</t2969> <t2970>"Make us as poor as we were when we founded this town, lest in the afterlife you charge us for this wastefulness."</t2970> <t2971>Her pleas were heard in the opposite sense.</t2971> <t2972>Indeed, one of the workers who was removing the bills accidentally stumbled upon an enormous plaster Saint Joseph that someone had left in the house during the last years of the war, and the hollow image shattered on the ground.</t2972> <t2973>It was stuffed with gold coins. No one remembered who had brought that life-sized saint.</t2973> <t2974>"Three men brought it," explained Amaranta.</t2974> <t2975>"They asked me to keep it while the rain passed, and I told them to put it there, in the corner, where no one would trip over it, and they placed it there very carefully, and it has been there ever since because they never came back to claim it."</t2975> <t2976>In recent times, Úrsula had lit candles and prostrated herself before it, without suspecting that instead of a saint, she was worshipping almost two hundred kilograms of gold.</t2976> <t2977>The late realization of her involuntary paganism worsened her dismay.</t2977> <t2978>She spat on the spectacular pile of coins, put it into three canvas sacks, and buried it in a secret place, waiting for the three strangers to eventually come and claim it.</t2978> <t2979>Much later, in the difficult years of her decrepitude, Úrsula would often intervene in the conversations of the numerous travelers who then passed through the house, and she would ask them if during the war they had left a plaster Saint Joseph there to be kept while the rain passed.</t2979>
<t2980>These things, which so greatly dismayed Úrsula, were common at that time.</t2980> <t2981>Macondo was drowning in a miraculous prosperity.</t2981> <t2982>The mud and cane houses of the founders had been replaced by brick constructions, with wooden shutters and cement floors, which made the suffocating heat of two in the afternoon more bearable.</t2982> <t2983>From the old village of José Arcadio Buendía, only the dusty almond trees, destined to withstand the harshest circumstances, and the river with its clear waters whose prehistoric stones were pulverized by the crazed sledgehammers of José Arcadio Segundo when he insisted on clearing the channel to establish a navigation service, remained.</t2983> <t2984>It was a delirious dream, comparable only to those of his great-grandfather, because the rocky bed and the numerous obstacles of the current prevented transit from Macondo to the sea.</t2984> <t2985>But José Arcadio Segundo, in an unforeseen burst of recklessness, persisted with the project.</t2985> <t2986>Until then, he had shown no sign of imagination.</t2986> <t2987>Except for his precarious adventure with Petra Cotes, he had never been known to have a woman.</t2987> <t2988>Úrsula considered him the dullest specimen the family had ever produced, incapable of standing out even as a cockfight troublemaker, when Colonel Aureliano Buendía told him the story of the Spanish galleon stranded twelve kilometers from the sea, whose charred ribs he himself saw during the war.</t2988> <t2989>The story, which had seemed fantastic to so many people for so long, was a revelation for José Arcadio Segundo.</t2989> <t2990>He auctioned off his roosters to the highest bidder, recruited men, bought tools, and embarked on the colossal enterprise of breaking stones, digging canals, clearing obstacles, and even leveling waterfalls.</t2990> <t2991>“I already know this by heart,” Úrsula shouted.</t2991> <t2992>“It’s as if time were going in circles and we had returned to the beginning.”</t2992> <t2993>When he deemed the river navigable, José Arcadio Segundo gave his brother a detailed presentation of his plans, and his brother gave him the money he needed for his enterprise.</t2993> <t2994>He disappeared for a long time.</t2994> <t2995>It was said that his project to buy a boat was nothing more than a ruse to abscond with his brother’s money, when news spread that a strange vessel was approaching the town.</t2995> <t2996>The inhabitants of Macondo, who no longer remembered the colossal enterprises of José Arcadio Buendía, rushed to the riverbank and saw with eyes wide with incredulity the arrival of the first and last boat that ever docked in the town.</t2996> <t2997>It was nothing more than a raft of logs, dragged by thick cables by twenty men walking along the riverbank.</t2997> <t2998>At the prow, with a gleam of satisfaction in his eyes, José Arcadio Segundo directed the extravagant maneuver.</t2998> <t2999>Along with him came a group of splendid matrons who protected themselves from the scorching sun with colorful umbrellas, and wore precious silk shawls on their shoulders, colorful ointments on their faces, natural flowers in their hair, gold snakes on their arms, and diamonds in their teeth.</t2999> <t3000>The log raft was the only vehicle that José Arcadio Segundo managed to bring up to Macondo, and only once, but he never acknowledged the failure of his enterprise; instead, he proclaimed his feat as a victory of will.</t3000> <t3001>He gave scrupulous accounts to his brother and soon returned to the routine of the roosters.</t3001> <t3002>The only thing that remained of that unfortunate initiative was the breath of renewal brought by the matrons from France, whose magnificent arts changed the traditional methods of love, and whose sense of social well-being swept away the outdated store of Catarino and transformed the street into a bazaar of Japanese lanterns and nostalgic barrel organs.</t3002> <t3003>They were the promoters of the bloody carnival that for three days plunged Macondo into delirium, and whose only lasting consequence was giving Aureliano Segundo the opportunity to meet Fernanda del Carpio.</t3003>
<t3004>Remedios, the beautiful, was proclaimed queen.</t3004> <t3005>Úrsula, who trembled before the unsettling beauty of her great-granddaughter, could not prevent the election.</t3005> <t3006>Until then, she had managed to keep her from going out, except to attend mass with Amaranta, but she made her cover her face with a black mantilla.</t3006> <t3007>The less pious men, those who disguised themselves as priests to say sacrilegious masses in Catarino's shop, attended church with the sole purpose of catching even a glimpse of the face of Remedios, the beautiful, whose legendary beauty was spoken of with an overwhelming fervor throughout the swamp area.</t3007> <t3008>A long time passed before they succeeded, and they would have been better off if the occasion had never come, for most of them never regained the tranquility of sleep.</t3008> <t3009>The man who made it possible, a stranger, lost his serenity forever, got entangled in the quagmires of abjection and misery, and years later was torn apart by a night train when he fell asleep on the tracks.</t3009> <t3010>From the moment he was seen in the church, wearing a green velvet suit and an embroidered vest, no one doubted that he had come from very far away, perhaps from a distant city abroad, drawn by the magical allure of Remedios, the beautiful.</t3010> <t3011>He was so handsome, so gallant and composed, with such well-carried poise, that next to him Pietro Crespi would have seemed like a premature baby, and many women murmured with spiteful smiles that he was the one who truly deserved the mantilla.</t3011> <t3012>He did not mingle with anyone in Macondo.</t3012> <t3013>He appeared at dawn on Sunday, like a fairytale prince, on a horse with silver stirrups and velvet trappings, and left the town after mass.</t3013>
<t3014>Such was the power of his presence that from the first time he was seen in the church, everyone took it for granted that between him and Remedios, the beautiful, a silent and tense duel had been established, a secret pact, an irrevocable challenge whose culmination could not be only love but also death.</t3014> <t3015>On the sixth Sunday, the gentleman appeared with a yellow rose in his hand.</t3015> <t3016>He heard the mass standing, as he always did, and at the end, he intercepted Remedios, the beautiful, and offered her the solitary rose.</t3016> <t3017>She received it with a natural gesture, as if she had been prepared for that homage, and then she revealed her face for an instant and thanked him with a smile.</t3017> <t3018>That was all she did.</t3018> <t3019>But not only for the gentleman, but for all the men who had the unfortunate privilege of witnessing it, that was an eternal moment.</t3019>
<t3020>Since then, the gentleman had been setting up the band next to Remedios the Beauty's window, sometimes until dawn.</t3020> <t3021>Aureliano Segundo was the only one who felt a heartfelt compassion for him and tried to break his perseverance.</t3021> <t3022>"Don't waste any more time," he told him one night.</t3022> <t3023>"The women of this house are worse than mules."</t3023> <t3024>He offered him his friendship, invited him to bathe in champagne, tried to make him understand that the women in his family had hearts of stone, but he couldn't break his obstinacy.</t3024> <t3025>Exasperated by the endless nights of music, Colonel Aureliano Buendía threatened to cure his affliction with gunshots.</t3025> <t3026>Nothing made him desist, except his own deplorable state of demoralization.</t3026> <t3027>From handsome and impeccable, he became vile and ragged.</t3027> <t3028>It was rumored that he had abandoned power and fortune in his distant nation, although his origin was never truly known.</t3028> <t3029>He became a man of brawls, a barroom brawler, and was found at dawn wallowing in his own excrement in Catarino's store.</t3029> <t3030>The saddest part of his drama was that Remedios the Beauty didn't even notice him, not even when he showed up at the church dressed as a prince.</t3030> <t3031>She received the yellow rose without the slightest malice, rather amused by the extravagance of the gesture, and lifted her mantilla to see his face better, not to show him hers.</t3031>
<t3032>In reality, Remedios the Beautiful was not a being of this world.</t3032> <t3033>Until she was well into puberty, Santa Sofía de la Piedad had to bathe her and dress her, and even when she could fend for herself, she had to be watched to prevent her from painting little animals on the walls with a stick smeared with her own feces.</t3033> <t3034>She reached the age of twenty without learning to read or write, without using cutlery at the table, and walking naked around the house, because her nature resisted any kind of conventionalism.</t3034> <t3035>When the young commander of the guard declared his love for her, she rejected him simply because his frivolity astonished her.</t3035> <t3036>“Look how simple he is,” she said to Amaranta.</t3036> <t3037>“He says he is dying for me, as if I were a colic miserere.”</t3037> <t3038>When they indeed found him dead next to her window, Remedios the Beautiful confirmed her initial impression.</t3038>
<t3039>—You see —he commented—.</t3039> <t3040>It was completely simple.</t3040>
<t3041>It seemed as if a penetrating lucidity allowed her to see the reality of things beyond any formalism.</t3041> <t3042>That was at least the point of view of Colonel Aureliano Buendía, for whom Remedios the Beauty was by no means mentally retarded, as was believed, but quite the opposite.</t3042> <t3043>"It's as if she came back from twenty years of war," he used to say.</t3043> <t3044>Úrsula, for her part, thanked God for rewarding the family with a creature of exceptional purity, but at the same time, her beauty disturbed her, because it seemed like a contradictory virtue, a diabolical trap in the midst of candor.</t3044> <t3045>That was why she decided to keep her away from the world, to preserve her from all earthly temptation, not knowing that Remedios the Beauty, from her mother's womb, was already safe from any contagion.</t3045> <t3046>It never crossed her mind that she would be chosen as the queen of beauty in the pandemonium of a carnival.</t3046> <t3047>But Aureliano Segundo, excited by the whirlwind of dressing up as a tiger, brought Father Antonio Isabel to the house to convince Úrsula that the carnival was not a pagan festival, as she said, but a Catholic tradition.</t3047> <t3048>Finally convinced, though reluctantly, she gave her consent for the coronation.</t3048>
<t3049>The news that Remedios Buendía was going to be the queen of the festival spread beyond the limits of the swamp in a few hours, reaching distant territories where the immense prestige of her beauty was unknown, and arousing the unease of those who still considered her surname a symbol of subversion.</t3049><t3050>It was an unfounded unease.</t3050><t3051>If anyone was harmless at that time, it was the aged and disillusioned Colonel Aureliano Buendía, who had gradually lost all contact with the reality of the nation.</t3051><t3052>Locked in his workshop, his only connection with the rest of the world was the trade of little gold fishes.</t3052><t3053>One of the former soldiers who guarded his house in the early days of peace would sell them in the swamp towns and return loaded with coins and news.</t3053><t3054>That the conservative government, he said, with the support of the liberals, was reforming the calendar so that each president would stay in power for a hundred years.</t3054><t3055>That the concordat with the Holy See had finally been signed, and a cardinal had come from Rome with a diamond crown and on a solid gold throne, and the liberal ministers had had their pictures taken kneeling as they kissed his ring.</t3055><t3056>That the leading chorus girl of a Spanish company, passing through the capital, had been kidnapped in her dressing room by a group of masked men, and the following Sunday had danced naked at the president of the republic's summer house.</t3056><t3057>"Don't talk to me about politics," the colonel would say to him.</t3057><t3058>"Our business is to sell little fishes."</t3058><t3059>The public rumor that he wanted nothing to do with the country's situation because he was getting rich from his workshop made Úrsula laugh when it reached her ears.</t3059><t3060>With her terrible practical sense, she could not understand the colonel's business, who exchanged the little fishes for gold coins, and then turned the gold coins back into little fishes, and so on, so that he had to work more and more as he sold more, to satisfy an exasperating vicious circle.</t3060><t3061>In truth, what interested him was not the business but the work.</t3061><t3062>He needed so much concentration to link scales, inlay tiny rubies in the eyes, laminate gills, and mount rudders, that he had no empty space left to fill with the disillusionment of the war.</t3062><t3063>So absorbing was the attention demanded by the meticulousness of his craft that in a short time he aged more than in all the years of the war, and the position twisted his spine and the precision wore out his eyesight, but the relentless concentration rewarded him with peace of mind.</t3063><t3064>The last time he was seen attending to any matter related to the war was when a group of veterans from both parties sought his support for the approval of lifelong pensions, always promised and always at the starting point.</t3064><t3065>"Forget about that," he told them.</t3065><t3066>"You see that I rejected my pension to rid myself of the torture of waiting for it until death."</t3066><t3067>At first, Colonel Gerineldo Márquez would visit him in the evening, and they would both sit at the street door to recall the past.</t3067><t3068>But Amaranta could not bear the memories evoked by that tired man whose baldness precipitated him into the abyss of premature old age, and she tormented him with unjust slights, until he only returned on special occasions, and finally disappeared, paralyzed.</t3068><t3069>Taciturn, silent, insensible to the new breath of vitality that shook the house, Colonel Aureliano Buendía barely understood that the secret to a good old age is nothing more than an honest pact with solitude.</t3069><t3070>He would get up at five after a superficial sleep, take his eternal bowl of bitter coffee in the kitchen, lock himself in the workshop all day, and at four in the afternoon would pass through the corridor dragging a stool, without even noticing the blaze of the rose bushes, the brightness of the hour, or the impassiveness of Amaranta, whose melancholy made a perfectly perceptible pot noise in the evening, and sit at the street door until the mosquitoes allowed him.</t3070><t3071>Someone once dared to disturb his solitude.</t3071>
<t3072>—How are you, Colonel? —he said as he passed by.</t3072>
<t3073>—Here —he replied—.</t3073> <t3074>Waiting for my funeral to pass.</t3074>
<t3075>Thus, the unease caused by the public reappearance of their surname, regarding the reign of Remedios, the beautiful, lacked any real foundation.</t3075> <t3076>Many, however, did not believe so.</t3076> <t3077>Innocent of the tragedy that threatened them, the townspeople overflowed into the public square in a boisterous explosion of joy.</t3077> <t3078>The carnival had reached its highest level of madness; Aureliano Segundo had finally fulfilled his dream of dressing up as a tiger and wandered happily among the frenzied crowd, hoarse from so much roaring, when a large parade appeared on the swamp road carrying on golden litters the most fascinating woman that imagination could conceive.</t3078> <t3079>For a moment, the peaceful inhabitants of Macondo removed their masks to better see the dazzling creature with an emerald crown and ermine cape, who seemed invested with legitimate authority, and not simply a sovereignty of sequins and crepe paper.</t3079> <t3080>There was no shortage of those with enough clairvoyance to suspect that it was a provocation.</t3080> <t3081>But Aureliano Segundo immediately overcame his perplexity, declared the newcomers as guests of honor, and seated Remedios, the beautiful, and the intruding queen on the same pedestal, Solomon-like.</t3081> <t3082>Until midnight, the outsiders dressed as Bedouins participated in the delirium and even enriched it with sumptuous pyrotechnics and acrobatic virtues that made one think of the arts of the gypsies.</t3082> <t3083>Suddenly, at the paroxysm of the party, someone broke the delicate balance.</t3083>
<t3084>—Long live the Liberal Party! —he shouted—.</t3084> <t3085>Long live Colonel Aureliano Buendía!</t3085>
<t3086>The rifle volleys drowned out the splendor of the fireworks, and the screams of terror overpowered the music, and the jubilation was annihilated by panic.</t3086> <t3087>Many years later, it would still be claimed that the royal guard of the intrusive sovereign was a squadron of the regular army that hid regulation rifles beneath their rich robes.</t3087> <t3088>The government rejected the charge in an extraordinary decree and promised a thorough investigation of the bloody episode.</t3088> <t3089>But the truth was never clarified, and the version prevailed forever that the royal guard, without any kind of provocation, took combat positions at a signal from their commander and mercilessly fired upon the crowd.</t3089> <t3090>When calm was restored, not a single one of the false Bedouins remained in the town, and lying in the square, among the dead and wounded, were nine clowns, four columbines, seventeen playing card kings, a devil, three musicians, two Peers of France, and three Japanese empresses.</t3090> <t3091>In the confusion of the panic, José Arcadio Segundo managed to save Remedios the Beautiful, and Aureliano Segundo carried the intrusive sovereign to the house in his arms, with her dress torn and her ermine cape stained with blood.</t3091> <t3092>Her name was Fernanda del Carpio.</t3092> <t3093>She had been selected as the most beautiful among the five thousand most beautiful women in the country, and she had been brought to Macondo with the promise of being named queen of Madagascar.</t3093> <t3094>Úrsula took care of her as if she were a daughter.</t3094> <t3095>The town, instead of doubting her innocence, felt pity for her naivety.</t3095> <t3096>Six months after the massacre, when the wounded had recovered and the last flowers in the mass grave had withered, Aureliano Segundo went to fetch her from the distant city where she lived with her father, and married her in Macondo, in a raucous twenty-day party.</t3096>
<t3097>The marriage was on the verge of ending after two months because Aureliano Segundo, trying to make amends to Petra Cotes, had her take a portrait dressed as the queen of Madagascar.</t3097> <t3098>When Fernanda found out, she packed her newlywed trunks again and left Macondo without saying goodbye.</t3098> <t3099>Aureliano Segundo caught up with her on the swamp road.</t3099> <t3100>After many pleas and promises of amendment, he managed to bring her back to the house, and he abandoned the concubine.</t3100>
<t3101>Petra Cotes, aware of her strength, showed no signs of concern.</t3101> <t3102>She had made him a man.</t3102> <t3103>While he was still a child, she took him out of Melquíades' room, with his head full of fantastic ideas and no contact with reality, and gave him a place in the world.</t3103> <t3104>Nature had made him reserved and elusive, with tendencies towards solitary meditation, and she had shaped his character into the opposite: vital, expansive, uninhibited, and had instilled in him the joy of living and the pleasure of partying and extravagance, until she turned him, inside and out, into the man she had dreamed of for herself since adolescence.</t3104> <t3105>He had gotten married, as children eventually do.</t3105> <t3106>He did not dare to break the news to her in advance.</t3106> <t3107>He assumed such a childish attitude towards the situation that he pretended to have false grudges and imaginary resentments, looking for a way for Petra Cotes to provoke the breakup.</t3107> <t3108>One day, when Aureliano Segundo unfairly reproached her, she avoided the trap and set things straight.</t3108>
<t3109>"What happens," he said, "is that you want to marry the queen."</t3109>
<t3110>Aureliano Segundo, ashamed, pretended to have a fit of rage, declared himself misunderstood and outraged, and did not visit her again.</t3110> <t3111>Petra Cotes, without losing for a single moment her magnificent composure of a resting beast, heard the music and fireworks of the wedding, the wild bustle of the public party, as if all of it were nothing more than another prank by Aureliano Segundo.</t3111> <t3112>To those who pitied her fate, she reassured them with a smile.</t3112> <t3113>"Don't worry," she told them.</t3113> <t3114>"Queens run errands for me."</t3114> <t3115>To a neighbor who brought her candles to light up the portrait of her lost lover, she said with enigmatic confidence:</t3115>
<t3116>—The only candle that will make him come is always lit.</t3116>
<t3117>Just as she had foreseen, Aureliano Segundo returned home as soon as the honeymoon was over.</t3117> <t3118>He brought along his usual friends, a traveling photographer, and the blood-stained ermine cape and suit that Fernanda had worn during the carnival.</t3118> <t3119>In the heat of the party that ignited that afternoon, he dressed Petra Cotes as a queen, crowned her the absolute and lifelong sovereign of Madagascar, and distributed copies of the portrait among his friends.</t3119> <t3120>She not only went along with the game but also felt a deep pity for him, thinking that he must have been very scared when he conceived that extravagant reconciliation tactic.</t3120> <t3121>At seven in the evening, still dressed as a queen, she received him in bed.</t3121> <t3122>He had been married for only two months, but she immediately realized that things were not going well in the marital bed, and she experienced the delightful pleasure of fulfilled revenge.</t3122> <t3123>Two days later, however, when he did not dare to return but instead sent an intermediary to arrange the terms of the separation, she understood that she would need more patience than anticipated, because he seemed willing to sacrifice himself for appearances.</t3123> <t3124>Even then, she did not get upset.</t3124> <t3125>She once again made things easier with a submission that confirmed the widespread belief that she was a poor woman, and the only memory she kept of Aureliano Segundo was a pair of patent leather boots that, according to him, were the ones he wanted to wear in the coffin.</t3125> <t3126>She stored them wrapped in rags at the bottom of a trunk and prepared herself for a wait without despair.</t3126>
<t3127>—Sooner or later he has to come —he told himself—, even if it's just to put on these boots.</t3127>
<t3128>He didn't have to wait as long as he thought.</t3128> <t3129>In fact, Aureliano Segundo realized on his wedding night that he would return to Petra Cotes' house much sooner than he would need to put on his patent leather boots: Fernanda was a woman lost to the world.</t3129> <t3130>She was born and raised a thousand kilometers from the sea, in a gloomy city where the stone alleyways still rattled, on nights of fright, with the carriages of the viceroys.</t3130> <t3131>Thirty-two bell towers tolled for the dead at six in the evening.</t3131> <t3132>In the stately house paved with sepulchral slabs, the sun was never known.</t3132> <t3133>The air had died in the cypresses of the courtyard, in the pale hangings of the bedrooms, in the dripping arcades of the garden of tuberoses.</t3133> <t3134>Until puberty, Fernanda had no other news of the world than the melancholic piano exercises played in some neighboring house by someone who for years and years allowed themselves the whim of not taking a nap.</t3134> <t3135>In the room of her sick mother, green and yellow under the dusty light of the stained glass windows, she listened to the methodical, tenacious, disheartened scales, and thought that this music was in the world, while she wasted away weaving funeral palm crowns.</t3135> <t3136>Her mother, sweating the fever of five o'clock, spoke to her of the splendor of the past.</t3136> <t3137>As a very young girl, one moonlit night, Fernanda saw a beautiful woman dressed in white who crossed the garden towards the oratory.</t3137> <t3138>What most disturbed her about that fleeting vision was that she felt exactly like her, as if she had seen herself twenty years in advance.</t3138> <t3139>“She is your great-grandmother, the queen,” her mother told her in the pauses of her cough.</t3139> <t3140>“She died from a bad air that struck her while cutting a stalk of tuberoses.”</t3140> <t3141>Many years later, when she began to feel like her great-grandmother, Fernanda doubted the childhood vision, but her mother reproached her for her disbelief.</t3141>
<t3142>—We are immensely rich and powerful —he told her—.</t3142> <t3143>One day you will be queen.</t3143>
<t3144>She believed it, although they only occupied the long table with linen tablecloths and silverware to have a cup of chocolate with water and a sweet bread.</t3144><t3145>Until the day of the wedding, she dreamed of a legendary reign, despite the fact that her father, Don Fernando, had to mortgage the house to buy her trousseau.</t3145><t3146>It was neither naivety nor delusions of grandeur.</t3146><t3147>That was how she was raised.</t3147><t3148>Since she could remember, she had done her business in a golden chamber pot with the family coat of arms.</t3148><t3149>She left the house for the first time at twelve years old, in a horse-drawn carriage that only had to travel two blocks to take her to the convent.</t3149><t3150>Her classmates were surprised that she was kept apart, in a high-backed chair, and that she didn't even mix with them during recess.</t3150><t3151>"She is different," the nuns explained.</t3151><t3152>"She is going to be a queen."</t3152><t3153>Her classmates believed it, because even then she was the most beautiful, distinguished, and discreet maiden they had ever seen.</t3153><t3154>After eight years, having learned to versify in Latin, to play the clavichord, to converse about falconry with gentlemen and apologetics with archbishops, to discuss state matters with foreign rulers and matters of God with the Pope, she returned to her parents' house to weave funeral palms.</t3154><t3155>She found it ransacked.</t3155><t3156>Only the essential furniture, the candelabras, and the silverware remained, because the household items had been sold, one by one, to cover the costs of her education.</t3156><t3157>Her mother had succumbed to the five o'clock fever.</t3157><t3158>Her father, Don Fernando, dressed in black, with a laminated collar and a gold watch chain across his chest, gave her a silver coin on Mondays for household expenses, and took the funeral wreaths finished the previous week.</t3158><t3159>He spent most of the day locked in the office, and on the few occasions when he went out, he returned before six to accompany her in praying the rosary.</t3159><t3160>She never had an intimate friendship with anyone.</t3160><t3161>She never heard about the wars that bled the country dry.</t3161><t3162>She never stopped hearing the piano exercises at three in the afternoon.</t3162><t3163>She was even beginning to lose the illusion of being a queen when two peremptory knocks sounded at the gate, and she opened it to a dashing military man, with ceremonious manners, who had a scar on his cheek and a gold medal on his chest.</t3163><t3164>He locked himself in the office with her father.</t3164><t3165>Two hours later, her father came to fetch her from the sewing room.</t3165><t3166>"Prepare your things," he said.</t3166><t3167>"You have to take a long trip."</t3167><t3168>That was how they took her to Macondo.</t3168><t3169>In a single day, with a brutal blow, life threw upon her all the weight of a reality that her parents had hidden from her for years.</t3169><t3170>Upon returning home, she locked herself in her room to cry, indifferent to Don Fernando's pleas and explanations, trying to erase the burn of that unheard-of mockery.</t3170><t3171>She had promised herself not to leave the bedroom until death, when Aureliano Segundo came to find her.</t3171><t3172>It was an inconceivable stroke of luck, because in the daze of indignation, in the fury of shame, she had lied to him so that he would never know her true identity.</t3172><t3173>The only real clues Aureliano Segundo had when he set out to find her were her unmistakable highland diction and her occupation as a funeral palm weaver.</t3173><t3174>He searched for her relentlessly.</t3174><t3175>With the fierce determination with which José Arcadio Buendía crossed the mountains to found Macondo, with the blind pride with which Colonel Aureliano Buendía promoted his useless wars, with the insane tenacity with which Úrsula ensured the survival of the lineage, Aureliano Segundo searched for Fernanda, without a single moment of discouragement.</t3175><t3176>When he asked where they sold funeral palms, they took him from house to house to choose the best ones.</t3176><t3177>When he asked where the most beautiful woman on earth was, all the mothers brought their daughters to him.</t3177><t3178>He got lost through foggy ravines, through times reserved for oblivion, through labyrinths of disillusionment.</t3178><t3179>He crossed a yellow wasteland where the echo repeated thoughts and anxiety caused premonitory mirages.</t3179><t3180>After weeks of fruitless searching, he arrived in an unknown city where all the bells were tolling for the dead.</t3180><t3181>Although he had never seen them, nor had anyone described them to him, he immediately recognized the walls corroded by the lime of bones, the decrepit balconies of wood gutted by fungi, and nailed to the gate and almost erased by the rain, the saddest little sign in the world: Funeral palms for sale.</t3181><t3182>From then until the cold morning when Fernanda left the house in the care of the Mother Superior, there was barely enough time for the nuns to sew the trousseau and pack the candelabras, the silverware, the golden chamber pot, and the countless and useless remnants of a family catastrophe that had taken two centuries to consummate into six trunks.</t3182><t3183>Don Fernando declined the invitation to accompany them.</t3183><t3184>He promised to come later, when he finished settling his commitments, and from the moment he blessed his daughter, he locked himself back in the office to write her letters with mourning borders and the family coat of arms that would be the first human contact Fernanda and her father would have in their entire lives.</t3184><t3185>For her, that was the real date of her birth.</t3185><t3186>For Aureliano Segundo, it was almost simultaneously the beginning and the end of happiness.</t3186>
<t3187>Fernanda carried a beautiful calendar with little golden keys in which her spiritual director had marked the dates of venereal abstinence with purple ink.</t3187> <t3188>Excluding Holy Week, Sundays, feast days, first Fridays, retreats, sacrifices, and cyclical impediments, her useful year was reduced to 42 days scattered in a tangle of purple crosses.</t3188> <t3189>Aureliano Segundo, convinced that time would tear down that hostile wire fence, extended the wedding celebration beyond the planned term.</t3189> <t3190>Exhausted from sending empty bottles of brandy and champagne to the trash so they wouldn't clutter the house, and at the same time intrigued that the newlyweds slept at different hours and in separate rooms while the fireworks, music, and cattle sacrifices continued, Úrsula remembered her own experience and wondered if Fernanda also had a chastity belt that would sooner or later provoke the town's mockery and give rise to a tragedy.</t3190> <t3191>But Fernanda confessed to her that she was simply letting two weeks pass before allowing the first contact with her husband.</t3191> <t3192>After the term had passed, indeed, she opened the door of her bedroom with the resignation to sacrifice as if she were an expiatory victim, and Aureliano Segundo saw the most beautiful woman on earth, with her glorious frightened animal eyes and long copper-colored hair spread out on the pillow.</t3192> <t3193>He was so fascinated by the vision that it took him a moment to realize that Fernanda had put on a white nightgown, long to her ankles and with sleeves to her wrists, and with a large, round buttonhole exquisitely trimmed at the height of her belly.</t3193> <t3194>Aureliano Segundo could not suppress an explosion of laughter.</t3194>
<t3195>—This is the most obscene thing I have ever seen in my life —he shouted, with a laugh that echoed throughout the house—.</t3195> <t3196>I married a little sister of charity.</t3196>
<t3197>A month later, not having succeeded in getting his wife to take off her nightgown, he went to make a portrait of Petra Cotes dressed as a queen.</t3197> <t3198>Later, when he managed to get Fernanda to return home, she yielded to his urgings in the fever of reconciliation, but she could not provide him with the rest he dreamed of when he went to fetch her from the city of the thirty-two bell towers.</t3198> <t3199>Aureliano Segundo found in her only a deep feeling of desolation.</t3199> <t3200>One night, shortly before their first child was born, Fernanda realized that her husband had secretly returned to the bed of Petra Cotes.</t3200>
<t3201>—That's right —he admitted.</t3201> <t3202>And he explained in a tone of abject resignation—:</t3202> <t3203>I had to do it, so the animals would keep giving birth.</t3203>
<t3204>It took him a little time to convince her of such a far-fetched scheme, but when he finally succeeded, through what seemed like irrefutable evidence, the only promise Fernanda imposed on him was that he should not be caught by death in the bed of his concubine.</t3204> <t3205>Thus, the three of them continued living together without getting in each other's way, Aureliano Segundo being punctual and affectionate with both, Petra Cotes flaunting the reconciliation, and Fernanda pretending to be unaware of the truth.</t3205>
<t3206>The pact did not, however, manage to get Fernanda to join the family.</t3206> <t3207>Úrsula insisted in vain that she discard the woolen collar she wore when she got up after making love, which provoked the neighbors' whispers.</t3207> <t3208>She couldn't convince her to use the bathroom, or the night chamber pot, or to sell the golden chamber pot to Colonel Aureliano Buendía so he could turn it into little fish.</t3208> <t3209>Amaranta felt so uncomfortable with her flawed diction and her habit of using a euphemism to designate everything that she always spoke in gibberish in front of her.</t3209>
<t3210>"It's the fate," he said, "it's one of those things that have their own miserable purpose."</t3210>
<t3211>One day, irritated by the mockery, Fernanda wanted to know what Amaranta was saying, and she did not use euphemisms to answer her.</t3211>
<t3212>—I say —he said— that you are one of those who confuse their ass with their elbows.</t3212>
<t3213>Since that day, they never spoke to each other again.</t3213><t3214>When circumstances forced them to, they sent messages or spoke indirectly.</t3214><t3215>Despite the visible hostility of the family, Fernanda did not give up her will to impose the habits of her elders.</t3215><t3216>She ended the custom of eating in the kitchen whenever one was hungry and imposed the obligation to eat at exact times at the large dining table, set with linen tablecloths, candlesticks, and silverware.</t3216><t3217>The solemnity of an act that Úrsula had always considered the simplest of daily life created an atmosphere of stiffness against which the quiet José Arcadio Segundo was the first to rebel.</t3217><t3218>But the custom prevailed, as did the practice of praying the rosary before dinner, and it drew so much attention from the neighbors that soon the rumor spread that the Buendía family did not sit at the table like other mortals but had turned the act of eating into a high mass.</t3218><t3219>Even Úrsula's superstitions, which arose more from momentary inspiration than tradition, clashed with those Fernanda inherited from her parents, which were perfectly defined and cataloged for every occasion.</t3219><t3220>While Úrsula enjoyed full control of her faculties, some of the old habits persisted, and the family's life retained a certain influence from her hunches. But when she lost her sight and the weight of the years relegated her to a corner, the circle of rigidity initiated by Fernanda from the moment she arrived completely closed, and no one but her determined the family's fate.</t3220><t3221>The pastry and candy animal business that Santa Sofía de la Piedad maintained by Úrsula's will was considered by Fernanda an unworthy activity, and she soon liquidated it.</t3221><t3222>The doors of the house, open wide from dawn until bedtime, were closed during the siesta, under the pretext that the sun overheated the bedrooms, and eventually, they were closed forever.</t3222><t3223>The aloe branch and the bread that had hung on the lintel since the founding days were replaced by a niche of the Sacred Heart of Jesus.</t3223><t3224>Colonel Aureliano Buendía noticed these changes and foresaw their consequences.</t3224><t3225>"We are becoming fine folks," he protested.</t3225><t3226>"At this rate, we will end up fighting against the conservative regime again, but this time to put a king in its place."</t3226><t3227>With very good tact, Fernanda took care not to clash with him.</t3227><t3228>His independent spirit, his resistance to all forms of social rigidity, bothered her deeply.</t3228><t3229>His bowls of coffee at five, the disorder of his workshop, his frayed blanket, and his habit of sitting at the street door at dusk exasperated her.</t3229><t3230>But she had to tolerate this loose piece of the family mechanism because she was certain that the old colonel was a beast pacified by years and disappointment, who in a fit of senile rebellion could uproot the foundations of the house.</t3230><t3231>When her husband decided to name their first son after his great-grandfather, she did not dare oppose it because she had only been there for a year.</t3231><t3232>But when the first daughter was born, she expressed without reservation her determination that she be named Renata, like her mother.</t3232><t3233>Úrsula had resolved that she be named Remedios.</t3233><t3234>After a tense controversy, in which Aureliano Segundo acted as an amused mediator, they baptized her with the name Renata Remedios, but Fernanda continued to call her Renata for short, while her husband's family and the whole town continued to call her Meme, a diminutive of Remedios.</t3234>
<t3235>In the beginning, Fernanda did not talk about her family, but over time she began to idealize her father.</t3235> <t3236>She spoke of him at the table as an exceptional being who had renounced all forms of vanity and was becoming a saint.</t3236> <t3237>Aureliano Segundo, astonished by the sudden magnification of his father-in-law, could not resist the temptation to make small jokes behind his wife's back.</t3237> <t3238>The rest of the family followed his example.</t3238> <t3239>Even Úrsula, who was extremely jealous of family harmony and secretly suffered from domestic friction, allowed herself to say once that the little great-great-grandson had his pontifical future assured because he was "the grandson of a saint and the son of a queen and a rustler."</t3239> <t3240>Despite that smiling conspiracy, the children got used to thinking of their grandfather as a legendary being who transcribed pious verses in letters to them and sent a crate of gifts every Christmas that barely fit through the street door.</t3240> <t3241>They were, in reality, the last remnants of the noble patrimony.</t3241> <t3242>With them, an altar was built in the children's bedroom with life-sized saints, whose glass eyes gave them a disturbing appearance of life and whose artistically embroidered cloth garments were better than those ever worn by any inhabitant of Macondo.</t3242> <t3243>Little by little, the funeral splendor of the old and cold mansion was transferred to the bright Buendía house.</t3243> <t3244>"They've already sent us the whole family cemetery," Aureliano Segundo commented on one occasion.</t3244> <t3245>"Only the willows and the tombstones are missing."</t3245> <t3246>Although nothing ever arrived in the crates that the children could use to play with, they spent the year waiting for December because, after all, the old-fashioned and always unpredictable gifts were a novelty in the house.</t3246> <t3247>On the tenth Christmas, when little José Arcadio was already preparing to travel to the seminary, the enormous crate from the grandfather arrived earlier than in previous years, very well nailed and waterproofed with tar, and addressed with the usual label in Gothic characters to the very distinguished lady Mrs. Fernanda del Carpio de Buendía.</t3247> <t3248>While she read the letter in the bedroom, the children hurried to open the box.</t3248> <t3249>Helped as usual by Aureliano Segundo, they scraped off the tar seals, un-nailed the lid, removed the protective sawdust, and found inside a long lead coffin closed with copper bolts.</t3249> <t3250>Aureliano Segundo removed the eight bolts, to the children's impatience, and barely had time to let out a scream and push them aside when he lifted the lead platform and saw Don Fernando dressed in black with a crucifix on his chest, his skin bursting with pestilent belches and cooking slowly in a frothy and bubbling broth of live pearls.</t3250>
<t3251>Shortly after the birth of the girl, the unexpected jubilee of Colonel Aureliano Buendía was announced, ordered by the government to celebrate a new anniversary of the Treaty of Neerlandia.</t3251> <t3252>It was a decision so inconsistent with official policy that the colonel vehemently opposed it and rejected the tribute.</t3252> <t3253>"It is the first time I hear the word jubilee," he said.</t3253> <t3254>"But whatever it means, it can only be a mockery."</t3254> <t3255>The narrow goldsmith's workshop filled with emissaries.</t3255> <t3256>The lawyers in dark suits, who once fluttered around the colonel like crows, returned, much older and much more solemn.</t3256> <t3257>When he saw them appear, just as they had come to bog down the war in the past, he could not bear the cynicism of their panegyrics.</t3257> <t3258>He ordered them to leave him in peace, insisting that he was not a national hero as they claimed, but a craftsman without memories, whose only dream was to die of exhaustion in the oblivion and misery of his little gold fishes.</t3258> <t3259>What outraged him the most was the news that the president of the republic himself planned to attend the events in Macondo to bestow upon him the Order of Merit.</t3259> <t3260>Colonel Aureliano Buendía sent word, word for word, that he eagerly awaited that belated but deserved occasion to shoot him, not to avenge the arbitrariness and anachronisms of his regime, but for disrespecting an old man who harmed no one.</t3260> <t3261>Such was the vehemence with which he pronounced the threat that the president of the republic canceled the trip at the last minute and sent the decoration with a personal representative.</t3261> <t3262>Colonel Gerineldo Márquez, besieged by pressures of all kinds, left his paralyzed bed to persuade his old comrade-in-arms.</t3262> <t3263>When he saw the rocking chair carried by four men and saw seated in it, among large pillows, the friend who had shared his victories and misfortunes since youth, he did not doubt for a single moment that he was making that effort to express his solidarity.</t3263> <t3264>But when he learned the true purpose of his visit, he had him removed from the workshop.</t3264>
<t3265>—Too late I convince myself —he said to him— that I would have done you a great favor if I had let you be shot.</t3265>
<t3266>Thus, the jubilee took place without the attendance of any of the family members.</t3266> <t3267>It was a coincidence that it coincided with carnival week, but no one could dissuade Colonel Aureliano Buendía from his stubborn belief that this coincidence had also been planned by the government to emphasize the cruelty of the mockery.</t3267> <t3268>From the solitary workshop, he heard the martial music, the ceremonial artillery, the bells of the Te Deum, and some phrases from the speeches delivered in front of the house when they christened the street with his name.</t3268> <t3269>His eyes welled up with indignation, with furious impotence, and for the first time since the defeat, he regretted not having the courage of his youth to start a bloody war that would erase every last vestige of the conservative regime.</t3269> <t3270>The echoes of the homage had not yet died down when Úrsula knocked on the workshop door.</t3270>
<t3271>—Don't bother me —he said—.</t3271> <t3272>I am busy.</t3272>
<t3273>—Open it —insisted Úrsula in an everyday tone—.</t3273> <t3274>This has nothing to do with the party.</t3274>
<t3275>Then Colonel Aureliano Buendía removed the bar, and saw at the door seventeen men of the most varied appearances, of all types and colors, but all with a solitary air that would have been enough to identify them anywhere on earth.</t3275><t3276>They were his sons.</t3276><t3277>Without agreeing beforehand, without knowing each other, they had arrived from the most remote corners of the coast, captivated by the noise of the jubilee.</t3277><t3278>They all proudly bore the name Aureliano, and their mother's surname.</t3278><t3279>During the three days they stayed in the house, to Úrsula's satisfaction and Fernanda's scandal, they caused war-like disturbances.</t3279><t3280>Amaranta searched among old papers for the account book where Úrsula had written down the names and dates of birth and baptism of all, and added the current address next to each corresponding space.</t3280><t3281>That list would have allowed a recapitulation of twenty years of war.</t3281><t3282>With it, the nocturnal itineraries of the colonel could have been reconstructed, from the dawn he left Macondo at the head of twenty-one men towards a chimerical rebellion, until he returned for the last time wrapped in the blood-stiffened blanket.</t3282><t3283>Aureliano Segundo did not miss the opportunity to celebrate with his cousins with a thunderous party of champagne and accordion, which was interpreted as a belated settling of accounts with the carnival spoiled by the jubilee.</t3283><t3284>They shattered half the crockery, destroyed the rose bushes chasing a bull to toss it, shot the chickens, forced Amaranta to dance Pietro Crespi's sad waltzes, got Remedios the Beauty to wear men's pants to climb the greasy pole, and released a lard-smeared pig in the dining room that knocked Fernanda over, but no one regretted the mishaps, because the house shook with an earthquake of good health.</t3284><t3285>Colonel Aureliano Buendía, who initially received them with distrust and even doubted the paternity of some, enjoyed their craziness, and before they left, he gave each one a little gold fish.</t3285><t3286>Even the elusive José Arcadio Segundo offered them an afternoon of cockfights, which almost ended in tragedy, because several of the Aurelianos were so skilled in cockfight dealings that they discovered Father Antonio Isabel's tricks at first glance.</t3286><t3287>Aureliano Segundo, who saw the limitless partying prospects offered by that unruly family, decided that they should all stay and work with him.</t3287><t3288>The only one who accepted was Aureliano Triste, a big mulatto with the impulses and exploratory spirit of his grandfather, who had already tried his luck in half the world, and didn't mind staying anywhere.</t3288><t3289>The others, although still single, considered their fate resolved.</t3289><t3290>They were all skilled artisans, homebodies, people of peace.</t3290><t3291>On Ash Wednesday, before they dispersed again along the coast, Amaranta managed to get them to wear Sunday clothes and accompany her to church.</t3291><t3292>More amused than pious, they let themselves be led to the communion rail, where Father Antonio Isabel placed the ash cross on their foreheads.</t3292><t3293>Back home, when the youngest wanted to clean his forehead, he discovered that the mark was indelible, as were those of his brothers.</t3293><t3294>They tried with water and soap, with dirt and scrubbing brush, and finally with pumice stone and lye, but they couldn't erase the cross.</t3294><t3295>In contrast, Amaranta and the others who went to mass removed it without difficulty.</t3295><t3296>"This way is better," Úrsula said goodbye to them.</t3296><t3297>"From now on, no one will be able to confuse you."</t3297><t3298>They left in a rush, preceded by the band and setting off fireworks, leaving the impression in the town that the Buendía lineage had seeds for many centuries.</t3298><t3299>Aureliano Triste, with his ash cross on his forehead, set up the ice factory on the outskirts of town that José Arcadio Buendía had dreamed of in his inventor's deliriums.</t3299>
<t3300>Months after his arrival, when he was already known and appreciated, Aureliano Triste was looking for a house to bring his mother and an unmarried sister (who was not the colonel's daughter) and became interested in the decrepit mansion that seemed abandoned on a corner of the square.</t3300> <t3301>He asked who the owner was.</t3301> <t3302>Someone told him it was a house that belonged to no one, where a solitary widow once lived who fed on the earth and lime from the walls, and in her last years was only seen twice on the street with a hat of tiny artificial flowers and shoes the color of old silver, when she crossed the square to the post office to send letters to the bishop.</t3302> <t3303>They told him that her only companion was a heartless servant who killed dogs and cats and any animal that entered the house, and threw the corpses in the middle of the street to plague the town with the stench of putrefaction.</t3303> <t3304>So much time had passed since the sun mummified the empty skin of the last animal that everyone assumed the owner of the house and the servant had died long before the wars ended, and that if the house was still standing, it was because there hadn't been a harsh winter or a devastating wind in recent years.</t3304> <t3305>The hinges crumbled by rust, the doors barely held by accumulations of cobwebs, the windows welded by humidity, and the floor broken by grass and wildflowers, in whose cracks lizards and all kinds of vermin nested, seemed to confirm the version that no human being had been there for at least half a century.</t3305> <t3306>The impulsive Aureliano Triste didn't need so much evidence to proceed.</t3306> <t3307>He pushed the main door with his shoulder, and the rotten wooden frame collapsed without a crash, in a silent cataclysm of dust and termite nests.</t3307> <t3308>Aureliano Triste stood on the threshold, waiting for the fog to clear, and then he saw in the center of the room the scrawny woman still dressed in clothes from the previous century, with a few yellow strands on her bald skull, and with large, still beautiful eyes in which the last stars of hope had faded, and the skin of her face cracked by the dryness of solitude.</t3308> <t3309>Shaken by the vision of another world, Aureliano Triste barely noticed that the woman was pointing an old military pistol at him.</t3309>
<t3310>—Excuse me —he murmured.</t3310>
<t3311>She remained motionless in the center of the room crammed with trinkets, examining inch by inch the giant with square shoulders and an ash tattoo on his forehead, and through the haze of dust she saw him in the mist of another time, with a double-barreled shotgun slung over his back and a string of rabbits in his hand.</t3311>
<t3312>—For the love of God —he exclaimed in a low voice—, it's not fair that they bring this memory to me now!</t3312>
<t3313>—I want to rent the house —said Aureliano Triste.</t3313>
<t3314>The woman then raised the gun, aiming with a steady hand at the ash cross, and cocked the trigger with unwavering determination.</t3314>
<t3315>—Go away —he ordered.</t3315>
<t3316>That night, during dinner, Aureliano Triste recounted the episode to the family, and Úrsula cried in dismay.</t3316> <t3317>“Good Lord,” she exclaimed, clutching her head with her hands.</t3317> <t3318>“She’s still alive!”</t3318> <t3319>Time, wars, and countless daily disasters had made her forget about Rebeca.</t3319> <t3320>The only one who had not lost consciousness for a single moment that she was alive, rotting in her soup of larvae, was the relentless and aged Amaranta.</t3320> <t3321>She thought of her at dawn, when the ice in her heart woke her in the lonely bed, and she thought of her when she soaped her withered breasts and emaciated belly, and when she put on the white petticoats and lace bodices of old age, and when she changed the black band of terrible atonement from one hand to the other.</t3321> <t3322>Always, at all hours, asleep and awake, in the most sublime moments and in the most abject ones, Amaranta thought of Rebeca, because solitude had selected her memories, and had incinerated the obstructive piles of nostalgic garbage that life had accumulated in her heart, and had purified, magnified, and eternalized the others, the most bitter ones.</t3322> <t3323>Because of her, Remedios the Beauty knew of Rebeca’s existence.</t3323> <t3324>Every time they passed by the decrepit house, she recounted an unpleasant incident, a fable of disgrace, trying in this way to ensure that her exhausting rancor was shared by her niece, and consequently prolonged beyond death, but she did not achieve her goals because Remedios was immune to all kinds of passionate feelings, and much more to those of others.</t3324> <t3325>Úrsula, on the other hand, who had undergone a process contrary to Amaranta’s, recalled Rebeca with a memory free of impurities, as the image of the pitiable creature they brought to the house with the sack of her parents' bones prevailed over the offense that made her unworthy of continuing to be linked to the family tree.</t3325> <t3326>Aureliano Segundo decided that she had to be brought to the house and protected, but his good intention was thwarted by Rebeca’s unyielding intransigence, who had needed many years of suffering and misery to conquer the privileges of solitude, and was not willing to renounce them in exchange for an old age disturbed by the false charms of mercy.</t3326>
<t3327>In February, when Colonel Aureliano Buendía's sixteen sons returned, still marked with the cross of ash, Aureliano Triste spoke to them about Rebeca in the heat of the party, and in half a day they restored the appearance of the house, changed doors and windows, painted the facade in cheerful colors, shored up the walls, and poured new cement on the floor, but they did not obtain authorization to continue the renovations inside.</t3327> <t3328>Rebeca did not even peek out the door.</t3328> <t3329>She let them finish the hasty restoration, and then calculated the costs and sent them, with Argénida, the old servant who still accompanied her, a handful of coins withdrawn from circulation since the last war, which Rebeca still believed to be useful.</t3329> <t3330>It was then that it became known to what inconceivable extent her disconnection from the world had reached, and it was understood that it would be impossible to rescue her from her stubborn seclusion as long as she had a breath of life left.</t3330>
<t3331>On the second visit that Colonel Aureliano Buendía's sons made to Macondo, another one of them, Aureliano Centeno, stayed to work with Aureliano Triste.</t3331> <t3332>He was one of the first who had arrived at the house for the baptism, and Úrsula and Amaranta remembered him very well because he had destroyed in a few hours every fragile object that passed through his hands.</t3332> <t3333>Time had moderated his initial growth impulse, and he was a man of medium height marked with smallpox scars, but his astonishing power of manual destruction remained intact.</t3333> <t3334>He broke so many plates, even without touching them, that Fernanda opted to buy him a pewter set before he could finish off the last pieces of her expensive china, and even the resistant metal plates were soon chipped and twisted.</t3334> <t3335>But in exchange for that irremediable power, exasperating even for himself, he had a cordiality that inspired immediate trust, and an outstanding capacity for work.</t3335> <t3336>In a short time, he increased ice production so much that it exceeded the local market, and Aureliano Triste had to consider the possibility of expanding the business to other towns in the swamp.</t3336> <t3337>It was then that he conceived the decisive step not only for the modernization of his industry but also to connect the town with the rest of the world.</t3337>
<t3338>—We need to bring the railroad —he said.</t3338>
<t3339>It was the first time that word was heard in Macondo.</t3339> <t3340>Faced with the drawing that Aureliano Triste traced on the table, which was a direct descendant of the schemes with which José Arcadio Buendía illustrated the solar war project, Úrsula confirmed her impression that time was going in circles.</t3340> <t3341>But unlike his grandfather, Aureliano Triste did not lose sleep or appetite, nor did he torment anyone with fits of bad temper, but rather conceived the most reckless projects as immediate possibilities, made rational calculations about costs and deadlines, and carried them out without intervals of exasperation.</t3341> <t3342>Aureliano Segundo, who if he had something of his great-grandfather and lacked something of Colonel Aureliano Buendía, it was an absolute impermeability to learning from mistakes, released the money to bring the railroad with the same frivolity with which he released it for his brother's absurd navigation company.</t3342> <t3343>Aureliano Triste consulted the calendar and left the following Wednesday to be back when the rains had passed.</t3343> <t3344>No further news was received.</t3344> <t3345>Aureliano Centeno, overwhelmed by the abundance of the factory, had already begun experimenting with making ice based on fruit juices instead of water, and without knowing it or intending to, he conceived the essential foundations of the invention of ice cream, thinking in this way to diversify the production of a business he assumed was his, because his brother showed no signs of returning after the rains had passed and an entire summer went by without news.</t3345> <t3346>At the beginning of the next winter, however, a woman who was washing clothes in the river at the hottest hour of the day, crossed the main street screaming in an alarming state of shock.</t3346>
<t3347>—Here it comes —he managed to explain— a dreadful matter like a kitchen dragging a village.</t3347>
<t3348>At that moment, the population was shaken by a whistle of dreadful resonances and a colossal wheezing breath.</t3348> <t3349>In the preceding weeks, they had seen the crews laying sleepers and rails, and no one paid them any attention because they thought it was a new trick of the gypsies who returned with their century-old and discredited racket of whistles and rattles, proclaiming the virtues of who knows what foolish concoction of ragtag Jerusalemite geniuses.</t3349> <t3350>But when they recovered from the bewilderment of the whistles and snorts, all the inhabitants rushed into the street and saw Aureliano Triste waving from the locomotive, and they watched in awe the train adorned with flowers that for the first time arrived eight months late.</t3350> <t3351>The innocent yellow train that was to bring so many uncertainties and evidences, so many praises and misfortunes, and so many changes, calamities, and nostalgias to Macondo.</t3351>
<t3352>Dazzled by so many and such wonderful inventions, the people of Macondo didn't know where to begin to be amazed.</t3352><t3353>They stayed up late contemplating the pale electric bulbs powered by the plant that Aureliano Triste brought on the second train trip, and to whose obsessive thump-thump it took time and effort to get used to.</t3353><t3354>They were outraged by the living images that the prosperous merchant Don Bruno Crespi projected in the theater with lion's mouth ticket booths, because a character who had died and been buried in one film, and for whose misfortune tears of grief were shed, reappeared alive and transformed into an Arab in the next film.</t3354><t3355>The audience, who paid two cents to share the vicissitudes of the characters, could not tolerate such an unprecedented mockery and broke the seating.</t3355><t3356>The mayor, at the urging of Don Bruno Crespi, explained through a decree that cinema was a machine of illusion that did not deserve the public's passionate outbursts.</t3356><t3357>Faced with the discouraging explanation, many believed they had been victims of another elaborate gypsy affair, so they chose not to return to the cinema, considering that they already had enough of their own sorrows to cry over the feigned misfortunes of imaginary beings.</t3357><t3358>Something similar happened with the cylinder phonographs brought by the cheerful matrons from France to replace the outdated barrel organs, which for a time deeply affected the interests of the band of musicians.</t3358><t3359>At first, curiosity multiplied the clientele of the forbidden street, and it was even known that respectable ladies disguised themselves as villains to closely observe the novelty of the phonograph, but they observed it so much and so closely that they soon concluded it was not a magical mill, as everyone thought and as the matrons said, but a mechanical trick that could not compare to something as moving, as human, and as full of everyday truth as a band of musicians.</t3359><t3360>It was such a severe disappointment that when phonographs became popular to the point that there was one in every house, they were still not regarded as objects for adult entertainment, but as something good for children to tear apart.</t3360><t3361>In contrast, when someone from the town had the opportunity to verify the harsh reality of the telephone installed at the railway station, which due to the crank was considered a rudimentary version of the phonograph, even the most skeptical were bewildered.</t3361><t3362>It was as if God had decided to test every capacity for amazement, and kept the inhabitants of Macondo in a permanent swing between joy and disappointment, doubt and revelation, to the point that no one could know for certain where the boundaries of reality lay.</t3362><t3363>It was an intricate jumble of truths and illusions, which convulsed José Arcadio Buendía's ghost with impatience under the chestnut tree and forced him to walk around the house even in broad daylight.</t3363><t3364>Since the railway was officially inaugurated and began to arrive regularly on Wednesdays at eleven, and the primitive wooden station with a desk, telephone, and ticket window was built, men and women were seen on the streets of Macondo pretending to have common and ordinary attitudes, but who in reality seemed like circus people.</t3364><t3365>In a town scalded by the gypsies' lesson, there was no good future for those acrobats of itinerant commerce who with equal impudence offered a whistling pot as a way of life for the salvation of the soul on the seventh day; but among those who were persuaded by fatigue and the always gullible, they obtained stupendous benefits.</t3365><t3366>Among those showbiz creatures, with riding pants and gaiters, cork hat, steel-framed glasses, topaz eyes, and fine rooster skin, one of those many Wednesdays, the chubby and smiling Mr. Herbert arrived in Macondo and had lunch at the house.</t3366>
<t3367>Nobody noticed him at the table until he ate the first bunch of bananas.</t3367> <t3368>Aureliano Segundo had found him by chance, struggling to speak Spanish because there were no free rooms at the Hotel de Jacob, and as he often did with many strangers, he took him to the house.</t3368> <t3369>He had a captive balloon business, which he had taken around the world with excellent profits, but he hadn't managed to lift anyone in Macondo because they considered that invention a step backward after having seen and tried the flying carpets of the gypsies.</t3369> <t3370>So, he was leaving on the next train.</t3370> <t3371>When they brought to the table the striped bunch of bananas that they usually hung in the dining room during lunch, he picked the first fruit without much enthusiasm.</t3371> <t3372>But he kept eating while talking, savoring, chewing, more with the distraction of a scholar than with the delight of a good eater, and after finishing the first bunch, he begged them to bring him another.</t3372> <t3373>Then he took out from the toolbox he always carried with him a small case of optical instruments.</t3373> <t3374>With the incredulous attention of a diamond buyer, he meticulously examined a banana, sectioning its parts with a special stiletto, weighing them on a pharmacist's balance, and measuring their span with a gunsmith's caliper.</t3374> <t3375>Then he took out a series of instruments from the box with which he measured the temperature, the degree of humidity in the atmosphere, and the intensity of the light.</t3375> <t3376>It was such an intriguing ceremony that nobody ate calmly, waiting for Mr. Herbert to finally issue a revealing judgment, but he said nothing that would allow them to glimpse his intentions.</t3376>
<t3377>In the following days, he was seen with a net and a basket catching butterflies around the village.</t3377><t3378>On Wednesday, a group of engineers, agronomists, hydrologists, topographers, and surveyors arrived, who for several weeks explored the same places where Mr. Herbert was catching butterflies.</t3378><t3379>Later, Mr. Jack Brown arrived in an additional wagon that was hooked to the tail of the yellow train, and it was all laminated in silver, with episcopal velvet armchairs and a ceiling of blue glass.</t3379><t3380>In the special wagon also arrived, fluttering around Mr. Brown, the solemn lawyers dressed in black who in another time followed Colonel Aureliano Buendía everywhere, and this made people think that the agronomists, hydrologists, topographers, and surveyors, as well as Mr. Herbert with his captive balloons and colorful butterflies, and Mr. Brown with his rolling mausoleum and his fierce German dogs, had something to do with the war.</t3380><t3381>There was not, however, much time to think about it, because the suspicious inhabitants of Macondo had just begun to wonder what the hell was going on, when the village had already transformed into a camp of wooden houses with zinc roofs, populated by strangers who arrived from half the world on the train, not only in the seats and platforms but even on the roofs of the wagons.</t3381><t3382>The gringos, who later brought their languid women in muslin dresses and large gauze hats, made a separate town on the other side of the train line, with streets lined with palm trees, houses with windows of metal screens, white tables on the terraces, and ceiling fans with blades, and extensive blue lawns with peacocks and quails.</t3382><t3383>The sector was fenced with a metal mesh, like a gigantic electrified chicken coop that in the cool months of summer dawned black with charred swallows.</t3383><t3384>No one yet knew what they were looking for, or if they were truly nothing more than philanthropists, and they had already caused a colossal disruption, much more disturbing than that of the old gypsies, but less transient and comprehensible.</t3384><t3385>Endowed with resources that in another era were reserved for Divine Providence, they modified the rainfall regime, hastened the crop cycle, and moved the river from where it had always been and placed it with its white stones and icy currents at the other end of the town, behind the cemetery.</t3385><t3386>It was on that occasion that they built a concrete fortress over the faded tomb of José Arcadio, so that the smell of gunpowder from the corpse would not contaminate the waters.</t3386><t3387>For the strangers who arrived without love, they turned the street of the affectionate French matrons into a town larger than the other, and on a glorious Wednesday they brought a train loaded with unbelievable prostitutes, Babylonian women trained in immemorial resources, and provided with all kinds of ointments and devices to stimulate the defenseless, awaken the timid, satisfy the voracious, exalt the modest, chastise the multiple, and correct the solitary.</t3387><t3388>The Street of the Turks, enriched with luminous grocery stores that displaced the old colorful bazaars, buzzed on Saturday night with crowds of adventurers jostling among the tables of luck and chance, the shooting galleries, the alley where the future was foretold and dreams were interpreted, and the tables of fried foods and drinks, which by Sunday morning were scattered on the ground, among bodies that were sometimes of happy drunks and almost always of curious ones struck down by gunshots, punches, knives, and bottle blows from the brawl.</t3388><t3389>It was such a tumultuous and sudden invasion that in the early days it was impossible to walk down the street with the obstruction of furniture and trunks, and the carpentry work of those who set up their houses on any bare land without anyone's permission, and the scandal of couples who hung their hammocks between the almond trees and made love under the awnings, in broad daylight and in full view of everyone.</t3389><t3390>The only corner of serenity was established by the peaceful Antillean blacks who built a marginal street, with wooden houses on stilts, on whose porches they sat in the evening singing melancholic hymns in their cumbersome Papiamento.</t3390><t3391>So many changes occurred in such a short time that eight months after Mr. Herbert's visit, the old inhabitants of Macondo would get up early to get to know their own village.</t3391>
<t3392>—Look at the mess we've gotten ourselves into —Colonel Aureliano Buendía used to say back then—, just for inviting a gringo to eat a banana.</t3392>
<t3393>Aureliano Segundo, on the other hand, was overjoyed with the avalanche of outsiders.</t3393><t3394>The house suddenly filled with unknown guests, invincible global revelers, and it was necessary to add bedrooms in the courtyard, enlarge the dining room, and replace the old table with one of sixteen places, with new dishes and services, and even then, shifts had to be established for lunch.</t3394><t3395>Fernanda had to choke down her scruples and attend to guests of the most perverse condition as if they were royalty, who muddied the corridor with their boots, urinated in the garden, spread their mats anywhere to take a nap, and spoke without regard for the susceptibilities of ladies or the niceties of gentlemen.</t3395><t3396>Amaranta was so scandalized by the invasion of the rabble that she went back to eating in the kitchen as in the old days.</t3396><t3397>Colonel Aureliano Buendía, convinced that most of those who came to greet him in the workshop did so not out of sympathy or esteem, but out of curiosity to see a historical relic, a museum fossil, chose to lock himself in with a bar and was seen only on very rare occasions sitting at the street door.</t3397><t3398>Úrsula, on the other hand, even in the times when she dragged her feet and walked feeling along the walls, experienced a childish joy when the train's arrival approached.</t3398><t3399>“We must make meat and fish,” she ordered the four cooks, who bustled to be on time under the unflappable direction of Santa Sofía de la Piedad.</t3399><t3400>“We must make everything,” she insisted, “because you never know what the outsiders want to eat.”</t3400><t3401>The train arrived at the hottest hour.</t3401><t3402>At lunch, the house trembled with a market-like uproar, and the sweaty diners, who didn't even know who their hosts were, burst in en masse to occupy the best seats at the table, while the cooks bumped into each other with enormous pots of soup, cauldrons of meats, tubs of vegetables, trays of rice, and distributed with inexhaustible ladles the barrels of lemonade.</t3402><t3403>The disorder was such that Fernanda was exasperated with the idea that many ate twice, and more than once she wanted to vent with market-woman insults because some confused diner asked her for the bill.</t3403><t3404>More than a year had passed since Mr. Herbert's visit, and the only thing known was that the gringos planned to plant bananas in the enchanted region that José Arcadio Buendía and his men had crossed seeking the route of great inventions.</t3404><t3405>Another two sons of Colonel Aureliano Buendía, with their ash cross on their foreheads, arrived dragged by that volcanic belch, and justified their determination with a phrase that perhaps explained the reasons of all.</t3405>
<t3406>—We come —they said— because everyone comes.</t3406>
<t3407>Remedios, the beautiful, was the only one who remained immune to the banana plague.</t3407> <t3408>She stagnated in a magnificent adolescence, increasingly impervious to formalities, more indifferent to malice and suspicion, happy in her own world of simple realities.</t3408> <t3409>She did not understand why women complicated their lives with corsets and petticoats, so she sewed herself a hemp smock that she simply slipped over her head, solving the problem of dressing without further ado, without losing the impression of being naked, which, as she understood things, was the only decent way to be at home.</t3409> <t3410>They bothered her so much to cut her rain-like hair that reached her calves, and to make buns with combs and braids with red ribbons, that she simply shaved her head and made wigs for the saints.</t3410> <t3411>The astonishing thing about her simplifying instinct was that the more she freed herself from fashion seeking comfort, and the more she disregarded conventions in obedience to spontaneity, the more disturbing her incredible beauty became and the more provocative her behavior with men.</t3411> <t3412>When Colonel Aureliano Buendía's sons came to Macondo for the first time, Úrsula remembered that they carried the same blood as the great-granddaughter, and she shuddered with a forgotten fear.</t3412> <t3413>"Open your eyes wide," she warned her.</t3413> <t3414>"With any of them, your children will be born with pig tails."</t3414> <t3415>She paid so little attention to the warning that she dressed as a man and rolled in the sand to climb the greasy pole, almost causing a tragedy among the seventeen cousins disturbed by the unbearable spectacle.</t3415> <t3416>That was why none of them slept in the house when they visited the town, and the four who stayed lived by Úrsula's arrangement in rented rooms.</t3416> <t3417>However, Remedios, the beautiful, would have died laughing if she had known about that precaution.</t3417> <t3418>Until the last moment she was on earth, she ignored that her irreparable destiny as a disturbing woman was a daily disaster.</t3418> <t3419>Every time she appeared in the dining room, contrary to Úrsula's orders, she caused a panic of exasperation among the strangers.</t3419> <t3420>It was too obvious that she was completely naked under the coarse nightgown, and no one could understand that her shaved and perfect skull was not a challenge, and that the audacity with which she uncovered her thighs to cool off, and the pleasure with which she sucked her fingers after eating with her hands, was not a criminal provocation.</t3420> <t3421>What no family member ever knew was that the strangers soon realized that Remedios, the beautiful, exuded a breath of disturbance, a gust of torment, which remained perceptible several hours after she had passed.</t3421> <t3422>Men experienced in love disorders, tested all over the world, claimed never to have suffered an anxiety similar to that produced by the natural scent of Remedios, the beautiful.</t3422> <t3423>In the begonias corridor, in the visiting room, in any place in the house, one could pinpoint the exact spot where she had been and the time elapsed since she had left.</t3423> <t3424>It was a defined, unmistakable trace that no one in the house could distinguish because it had long been incorporated into the everyday smells, but which the strangers identified immediately.</t3424> <t3425>That was why they were the only ones who understood that the young commander of the guard had died of love, and that a gentleman from other lands had fallen into despair.</t3425> <t3426>Unaware of the disturbing atmosphere in which she moved, of the unbearable state of intimate calamity she caused in her wake, Remedios, the beautiful, treated men without the slightest malice and ended up disturbing them with her innocent compliances.</t3426> <t3427>When Úrsula managed to impose the order that she eat with Amaranta in the kitchen so that the strangers would not see her, she felt more comfortable because, after all, she was safe from all discipline.</t3427> <t3428>In reality, it made no difference to her to eat anywhere, and not at fixed times but according to the whims of her appetite.</t3428> <t3429>Sometimes she would get up to have lunch at three in the morning, sleep all day, and spend several months with her schedule disrupted, until some casual incident would put her back in order.</t3429> <t3430>When things were going better, she would get up at eleven in the morning and lock herself up for two hours completely naked in the bathroom, killing scorpions while shaking off the dense and prolonged sleep.</t3430> <t3431>Then she would pour water from the pool over herself with a gourd.</t3431> <t3432>It was such a prolonged, meticulous act, so rich in ceremonial situations, that anyone who did not know her well might have thought she was engaged in a deserved adoration of her own body.</t3432> <t3433>For her, however, that solitary ritual lacked all sensuality and was simply a way to pass the time until she got hungry.</t3433> <t3434>One day, as she was beginning to bathe, a stranger lifted a tile from the roof and was left breathless at the tremendous spectacle of her nakedness.</t3434> <t3435>She saw the desolate eyes through the broken tiles and did not react with shame, but with alarm.</t3435>
<t3436>—Careful —he exclaimed—.</t3436> <t3437>It is going to fall.</t3437>
<t3438>—I just want to see her —murmured the stranger.</t3438>
<t3439>—Ah, well —she said—.</t3439> <t3440>But be careful, those tiles are rotten.</t3440>
<t3441>The stranger's face had a painful expression of astonishment, and he seemed to be silently battling against his primal impulses to not dispel the mirage.</t3441> <t3442>Remedios, the beautiful, thought he was suffering from the fear that the tiles might break, and she bathed more quickly than usual so that the man would no longer be in danger.</t3442> <t3443>As she poured water from the pool, she told him that it was a problem that the roof was in that state, as she believed that the bed of leaves rotted by the rain was what filled the bathroom with scorpions.</t3443> <t3444>The stranger mistook that chatter for a way to conceal her complacency, so when she began to soap herself, he yielded to the temptation to take a step forward.</t3444>
<t3445>—Let me soap you up —he murmured.</t3445>
<t3446>—I appreciate the good intention —she said—, but I can manage with my own two hands.</t3446>
<t3447>—Even if it's just the back —pleaded the stranger.</t3447>
<t3448>—It would be pointless —she said—.</t3448> <t3449>People never wash their backs.</t3449>
<t3450>Afterwards, while she was drying herself, the stranger begged her with tear-filled eyes to marry him.</t3450> <t3451>She sincerely replied that she would never marry such a simple man who wasted almost an hour, and even skipped lunch, just to watch a woman bathe.</t3451> <t3452>In the end, when she put on the cloak, the man could not bear the confirmation that she indeed wore nothing underneath, as everyone suspected, and he felt forever marked by the burning iron of that secret.</t3452> <t3453>Then he removed two more tiles to lower himself into the bathroom.</t3453>
<t3454>—It's very high —she warned him, scared—.</t3454> <t3455>He's going to kill himself!</t3455>
<t3456>The rotten tiles shattered with a crash of disaster, and the man barely managed to let out a scream of terror, and he broke his skull and died without agony on the cement floor.</t3456><t3457>The strangers who heard the commotion in the dining room and hurried to take away the corpse perceived the suffocating scent of Remedios, the beautiful, on his skin.</t3457><t3458>It was so ingrained with the body that the cracks in the skull did not bleed but oozed an amber oil impregnated with that secret perfume, and then they understood that the scent of Remedios, the beautiful, continued to torment men beyond death, down to the dust of their bones.</t3458><t3459>However, they did not connect that horrific accident with the other two men who had died because of Remedios, the beautiful.</t3459><t3460>There was still one more victim needed for the strangers, and many of the old inhabitants of Macondo, to believe the legend that Remedios Buendía did not exhale a breath of love, but a deadly flow.</t3460><t3461>The opportunity to verify it came months later, one afternoon when Remedios, the beautiful, went with a group of friends to see the new plantations.</t3461><t3462>For the people of Macondo, it was a recent distraction to walk through the humid and endless avenues lined with banana trees, where the silence seemed to come from somewhere else, still unused, and was therefore so clumsy at transmitting the voice.</t3462><t3463>Sometimes what was said half a meter away was not very well understood, and yet it was perfectly comprehensible at the other end of the plantation.</t3463><t3464>For the girls of Macondo, that novel game was a reason for laughter and surprises, for scares and jokes, and at night they talked about the walk as if it were a dream experience.</t3464><t3465>Such was the prestige of that silence that Úrsula did not have the heart to deprive Remedios, the beautiful, of the fun and allowed her to go one afternoon, as long as she wore a hat and suitable attire.</t3465><t3466>From the moment the group of friends entered the plantation, the air was impregnated with a deadly fragrance.</t3466><t3467>The men working in the ditches felt possessed by a strange fascination, threatened by an invisible danger, and many succumbed to the terrible desire to cry.</t3467><t3468>Remedios, the beautiful, and her frightened friends managed to take refuge in a nearby house when they were about to be assaulted by a horde of ferocious males.</t3468><t3469>Soon after, they were rescued by the four Aurelianos, whose ash crosses inspired a sacred respect, as if they were a mark of caste, a seal of invulnerability.</t3469><t3470>Remedios, the beautiful, did not tell anyone that one of the men, taking advantage of the tumult, managed to assault her belly with a hand that seemed more like an eagle's claw clinging to the edge of a precipice.</t3470><t3471>She faced the aggressor in a kind of instant dazzle and saw the disconsolate eyes that were imprinted on her heart like a brand of pity.</t3471><t3472>That night, the man boasted of his audacity and bragged about his luck on the Street of the Turks, minutes before a horse's kick crushed his chest, and a crowd of strangers saw him agonize in the middle of the street, choking on blood vomit.</t3472>
<t3473>The assumption that Remedios, the beautiful, possessed powers of death was then supported by four irrefutable facts.</t3473><t3474>Although some men, light of tongue, delighted in saying that it was well worth sacrificing life for a night of love with such a disturbing woman, the truth was that none made efforts to achieve it.</t3474><t3475>Perhaps, not only to subdue her but also to ward off her dangers, a feeling as primitive and simple as love would have sufficed, but that was the only thing that did not occur to anyone.</t3475><t3476>Úrsula no longer concerned herself with her.</t3476><t3477>At another time, when she had not yet given up the purpose of saving her for the world, she tried to get her interested in the basic affairs of the house.</t3477><t3478>"Men ask for more than you think," she would say enigmatically.</t3478><t3479>"There is much to cook, much to sweep, much to suffer for trivialities, besides what you think."</t3479><t3480>Deep down, she was deceiving herself by trying to train her for domestic happiness, because she was convinced that once passion was satisfied, there was not a man on earth capable of enduring even for a day a negligence that was beyond all comprehension.</t3480><t3481>The birth of the last José Arcadio, and her unbreakable will to educate him to become Pope, eventually made her give up her concerns for her great-granddaughter.</t3481><t3482>She abandoned her to her fate, trusting that sooner or later a miracle would occur, and that in this world where there was everything, there would also be a man with enough patience to take her on.</t3482><t3483>Long before, Amaranta had given up all attempts to turn her into a useful woman.</t3483><t3484>From the forgotten afternoons in the sewing room, when her niece barely showed interest in turning the crank of the sewing machine, she came to the simple conclusion that she was foolish.</t3484><t3485>"We are going to have to raffle you off," she would say, perplexed at her impermeability to men's words.</t3485><t3486>Later, when Úrsula insisted that Remedios, the beautiful, attend mass with her face covered with a mantilla, Amaranta thought that mysterious resource would be so provocative that very soon there would be a man intrigued enough to patiently seek the weak point of her heart.</t3486><t3487>But when she saw the senseless way in which she scorned a suitor who for many reasons was more desirable than a prince, she gave up all hope.</t3487><t3488>Fernanda did not even attempt to understand her.</t3488><t3489>When she saw Remedios, the beautiful, dressed as a queen in the bloody carnival, she thought she was an extraordinary creature.</t3489><t3490>But when she saw her eating with her hands, incapable of giving a response that was not a prodigy of simplicity, the only thing she regretted was that the family's fools had such long lives.</t3490><t3491>Despite Colonel Aureliano Buendía still believing and repeating that Remedios, the beautiful, was actually the most lucid being he had ever known, and that she demonstrated it at every moment with her astonishing ability to mock everyone, they abandoned her to God's mercy.</t3491><t3492>Remedios, the beautiful, was left wandering through the desert of solitude, without crosses to bear, maturing in her dreamless dreams, in her endless baths, in her meals without schedules, in her deep and prolonged silences without memories, until one March afternoon when Fernanda wanted to fold her linen sheets in the garden and asked for help from the women of the house.</t3492><t3493>They had barely started when Amaranta noticed that Remedios, the beautiful, was becoming transparent with an intense pallor.</t3493>
<t3494>—Do you feel unwell? —he asked her.</t3494>
<t3495>Remedios, the beauty, who was holding the sheet by the other end, gave a smile of pity.</t3495>
<t3496>—On the contrary —he said—, I have never felt better.</t3496>
<t3497>She had just said it, when Fernanda felt a delicate wind of light snatch the sheets from her hands and spread them out in all their breadth.</t3497> <t3498>Amaranta felt a mysterious tremor in the lace of her petticoats and tried to grab the sheet to avoid falling, at the moment when Remedios the Beautiful began to rise.</t3498> <t3499>Úrsula, almost blind by then, was the only one who had the composure to identify the nature of that irreparable wind, and she let the sheets be at the mercy of the light, watching Remedios the Beautiful, who was waving goodbye to her, amidst the dazzling flutter of the sheets that rose with her, that left with her the air of beetles and dahlias, and passed with her through the air where four in the afternoon ended, and were lost with her forever in the high airs where not even the highest birds of memory could reach her.</t3499>
<t3500>The outsiders, of course, thought that Remedios the Beauty had finally succumbed to her irrevocable destiny as queen bee, and that her family was trying to save their honor with the tale of levitation.</t3500><t3501>Fernanda, bitten by envy, ended up accepting the miracle, and for a long time continued to pray to God to return the sheets.</t3501><t3502>The majority believed in the miracle, and candles were even lit and novenas prayed.</t3502><t3503>Perhaps nothing else would have been talked about for a long time if the barbaric extermination of the Aurelianos had not replaced astonishment with horror.</t3503><t3504>Although he never identified it as an omen, Colonel Aureliano Buendía had in some way foreseen the tragic end of his sons.</t3504><t3505>When Aureliano Serrador and Aureliano Arcaya, the two who arrived in the tumult, expressed their desire to stay in Macondo, their father tried to dissuade them.</t3505><t3506>He did not understand what they were going to do in a town that overnight had become a place of danger.</t3506><t3507>But Aureliano Centeno and Aureliano Triste, supported by Aureliano Segundo, gave them work in their businesses.</t3507><t3508>Colonel Aureliano Buendía had still very confused reasons for not sponsoring that decision.</t3508><t3509>Since he saw Mr. Brown in the first car that arrived in Macondo —an orange convertible with a horn that scared the dogs with its honking—, the old warrior was outraged by the servile fuss of the people, and realized that something had changed in the nature of men since the times when they abandoned women and children and slung a shotgun over their shoulder to go to war.</t3509><t3510>The local authorities, after the armistice of Neerlandia, were mayors without initiative, decorative judges, chosen among the peaceful and tired conservatives of Macondo.</t3510><t3511>"This is a regime of poor devils," commented Colonel Aureliano Buendía when he saw the barefoot policemen armed with wooden clubs pass by.</t3511><t3512>"We fought so many wars, and all for them not to paint our house blue."</t3512><t3513>When the banana company arrived, however, the local officials were replaced by authoritarian outsiders, whom Mr. Brown took to live in the electrified chicken coop, so that they could enjoy, as he explained, the dignity that corresponded to their office, and not suffer the heat and mosquitoes and countless discomforts and deprivations of the town.</t3513><t3514>The former policemen were replaced by machete-wielding thugs.</t3514><t3515>Locked in the workshop, Colonel Aureliano Buendía thought about these changes, and for the first time in his silent years of solitude, he was tormented by the definite certainty that it had been a mistake not to continue the war to its ultimate consequences.</t3515><t3516>In those days, a brother of the forgotten Colonel Magnífico Visbal took his seven-year-old grandson to have a refreshment at the carts in the square, and because the child accidentally bumped into a police corporal and spilled the refreshment on his uniform, the barbarian hacked him to pieces with a machete and decapitated the grandfather who tried to stop him with a single stroke.</t3516><t3517>The whole town saw the decapitated man pass by when a group of men carried him to his house, and the head dragged by a woman who held it by the hair, and the bloodstained sack where they had put the pieces of the child.</t3517>
<t3518>For Colonel Aureliano Buendía, it was the limit of atonement.</t3518> <t3519>He suddenly found himself suffering the same indignation he felt in his youth, in front of the corpse of the woman who was beaten to death because she was bitten by a rabid dog.</t3519> <t3520>He looked at the groups of onlookers in front of the house and with his old stentorian voice, restored by a deep contempt for himself, he hurled at them the burden of hatred that he could no longer bear in his heart.</t3520>
<t3521>—One of these days —he shouted— I'm going to arm my boys so they can finish off these damn gringos!</t3521>
<t3522>During the course of that week, in various places along the coast, his seventeen sons were hunted like rabbits by invisible criminals who aimed at the center of their ash crosses.</t3522> <t3523>Aureliano Triste was leaving his mother's house at seven in the evening when a rifle shot from the darkness pierced his forehead.</t3523> <t3524>Aureliano Centeno was found in the hammock he used to hang in the factory, with an ice pick stabbed to the hilt between his eyebrows.</t3524> <t3525>Aureliano Serrador had left his girlfriend at her parents' house after taking her to the movies, and was returning through the illuminated Calle de los Turcos when someone who was never identified among the crowd fired a revolver shot that knocked him into a cauldron of boiling lard.</t3525> <t3526>A few minutes later, someone knocked on the door of the room where Aureliano Arcaya was locked in with a woman, and shouted: "Hurry up, they are killing your brothers."</t3526> <t3527>The woman who was with him later recounted that Aureliano Arcaya jumped out of bed and opened the door, and was met with a Mauser volley that shattered his skull.</t3527> <t3528>That night of death, while the house was preparing to mourn the four corpses, Fernanda roamed the town like a madwoman looking for Aureliano Segundo, whom Petra Cotes had locked in a wardrobe believing that the extermination order included anyone bearing the colonel's name.</t3528> <t3529>She did not let him out until the fourth day, when the telegrams received from various places along the coast made it clear that the invisible enemy's fury was directed only against the brothers marked with ash crosses.</t3529> <t3530>Amaranta searched for the account book where she had noted the nephews' details, and as the telegrams arrived, she crossed out names until only the eldest remained.</t3530> <t3531>They remembered him well for the contrast of his dark skin with his large green eyes.</t3531> <t3532>His name was Aureliano Amador, he was a carpenter, and he lived in a remote village in the foothills of the mountains.</t3532> <t3533>After waiting two weeks for the telegram of his death, Aureliano Segundo sent an emissary to warn him, thinking he was unaware of the threat hanging over him.</t3533> <t3534>The emissary returned with the news that Aureliano Amador was safe.</t3534> <t3535>The night of the extermination, two men had gone to his house and emptied their revolvers at him, but they had not hit the ash cross.</t3535> <t3536>Aureliano Amador managed to jump over the backyard fence and disappeared into the labyrinths of the mountains, which he knew inch by inch thanks to his friendship with the Indians with whom he traded in wood.</t3536> <t3537>He had not been heard from again.</t3537>
<t3538>They were dark days for Colonel Aureliano Buendía.</t3538> <t3539>The president of the republic sent him a telegram of condolence, in which he promised a thorough investigation and paid tribute to the dead.</t3539> <t3540>By his order, the mayor attended the funeral with four funeral wreaths that he intended to place on the coffins, but the colonel threw him out.</t3540> <t3541>After the funeral, he drafted and personally delivered a violent telegram to the president of the republic, which the telegraph operator refused to send.</t3541> <t3542>Then he enriched it with terms of singular aggressiveness, put it in an envelope, and sent it by mail.</t3542> <t3543>As had happened with the death of his wife, as had happened so many times during the war with the death of his best friends, he did not feel a sense of sorrow, but a blind and directionless rage, an exhausting impotence.</t3543> <t3544>He even went so far as to denounce the complicity of Father Antonio Isabel, for having marked his children with indelible ash so that they could be identified by their enemies.</t3544> <t3545>The decrepit priest, who no longer strung his ideas together very well and was beginning to scare the parishioners with the absurd interpretations he attempted from the pulpit, appeared one afternoon at the house with the bowl where he prepared the ashes for Wednesday, and tried to anoint the whole family with them to prove that they could be washed off with water.</t3545> <t3546>But the horror of the misfortune had sunk so deep that not even Fernanda agreed to the experiment, and never again was a Buendía seen kneeling at the communion rail on Ash Wednesday.</t3546>
<t3547>Colonel Aureliano Buendía could not regain his composure for a long time.</t3547> <t3548>He abandoned the making of little fish, barely ate, and wandered like a sleepwalker throughout the house, dragging the blanket and chewing on a muted anger.</t3548> <t3549>After three months, his hair was ashen, the once waxed tips of his mustache drooped over his colorless lips, but his eyes were once again the two embers that had frightened those who saw him born and that once made chairs roll with just a look.</t3549> <t3550>In the fury of his torment, he tried in vain to provoke the omens that had guided his youth along paths of danger to the desolate wasteland of glory.</t3550> <t3551>He was lost, astray in a foreign house where nothing and no one aroused the slightest trace of affection in him.</t3551> <t3552>Once, he opened Melquíades' room, searching for traces of a past before the war, and found only rubble, trash, and heaps of filth accumulated over so many years of neglect.</t3552> <t3553>On the covers of books that no one had read again, on the old parchments macerated by humidity, a livid flora had thrived, and in the air that had been the purest and brightest in the house floated an unbearable smell of rotten memories.</t3553> <t3554>One morning he found Úrsula crying under the chestnut tree, on the knees of her dead husband.</t3554> <t3555>Colonel Aureliano Buendía was the only inhabitant of the house who no longer saw the powerful old man weighed down by half a century of exposure.</t3555> <t3556>“Greet your father,” Úrsula said to him.</t3556> <t3557>He paused for a moment in front of the chestnut tree, and once again confirmed that even that empty space did not arouse any affection in him.</t3557>
<t3558>—What does it say? —he asked.</t3558>
<t3559>—She is very sad —Úrsula replied— because she thinks you are going to die.</t3559>
<t3560>—Tell him —the colonel smiled— that one does not die when one should, but when one can.</t3560>
<t3561>The omen of his dead father stirred the last ember of pride left in his heart, but he mistook it for a sudden surge of strength.</t3561> <t3562>That is why he besieged Úrsula to reveal to him the spot in the yard where the gold coins found inside the plaster Saint Joseph were buried.</t3562> <t3563>"You will never know," she told him, with a firmness inspired by an old lesson.</t3563> <t3564>"One day," she added, "the owner of that fortune will appear, and only he will be able to unearth it."</t3564> <t3565>Nobody knew why a man who had always been so detached had begun to covet money with such anxiety, and not the modest amounts that would have sufficed to resolve an emergency, but a fortune of outrageous proportions whose mere mention left Aureliano Segundo in a sea of astonishment.</t3565> <t3566>The old comrades he turned to for help hid to avoid receiving him.</t3566> <t3567>It was around that time that he was heard to say, "The only current difference between liberals and conservatives is that liberals go to five o'clock mass and conservatives go to eight o'clock mass."</t3567> <t3568>However, he insisted with such tenacity, pleaded so earnestly, and compromised his principles of dignity to such an extent that, with a little from here and a little from there, slipping everywhere with stealthy diligence and ruthless perseverance, he managed to gather more money in eight months than Úrsula had buried.</t3568> <t3569>Then he visited the ailing Colonel Gerineldo Márquez to ask for his help in promoting total war.</t3569>
<t3570>At a certain moment, Colonel Gerineldo Márquez was truly the only one who could have moved, even from his cripple's rocking chair, the rusted threads of the rebellion.</t3570> <t3571>After the armistice of Neerlandia, while Colonel Aureliano Buendía took refuge in the exile of his little gold fishes, he kept in contact with the rebel officers who remained loyal to him until the defeat.</t3571> <t3572>He waged with them the sad war of daily humiliation, of pleas and memorials, of come back tomorrow, of almost there, of we are studying your case with due attention; the war hopelessly lost against the very attentive and confident officials who were supposed to assign but never assigned the lifelong pensions.</t3572> <t3573>The other war, the bloody one of twenty years, did not cause them as much havoc as the corrosive war of eternal postponement.</t3573> <t3574>Colonel Gerineldo Márquez himself, who escaped three assassination attempts, survived five wounds, and came out unscathed from countless battles, succumbed to the atrocious siege of waiting and sank into the miserable defeat of old age thinking of Amaranta among the rhombuses of light in a borrowed house.</t3574> <t3575>The last veterans who were heard of appeared photographed in a newspaper, with their faces lifted in indignity, next to an anonymous president of the republic who gave them some buttons with his effigy to wear on their lapels, and returned to them a flag stained with blood and gunpowder to place over their coffins.</t3575> <t3576>The others, the more dignified ones, were still waiting for a letter in the penumbra of public charity, dying of hunger, surviving on rage, rotting from old age in the exquisite filth of glory.</t3576> <t3577>So when Colonel Aureliano Buendía invited him to promote a deadly conflagration that would wipe out every trace of a regime of corruption and scandal sustained by the foreign invader, Colonel Gerineldo Márquez could not suppress a shudder of compassion.</t3577>
<t3578>—Oh, Aureliano —he sighed—, I already knew you were old, but now I realize you are much older than you seem.</t3578>
<t3579>In the bewilderment of recent years, Úrsula had very few breaks to attend to José Arcadio's papal formation, when he had to be hastily prepared to go to the seminary.</t3579><t3580>Meme, his sister, divided between Fernanda's rigidity and Amaranta's bitterness, reached almost at the same time the age to be sent to the nuns' school where they would make her a virtuoso of the clavichord.</t3580><t3581>Úrsula was tormented by serious doubts about the effectiveness of the methods with which she had tempered the spirit of the languid apprentice of the Supreme Pontiff, but she did not blame her stumbling old age or the clouds that barely allowed her to glimpse the outline of things, but rather something she herself could not define but vaguely conceived as a progressive wear of time.</t3581><t3582>"The years now don't come like they used to," she would say, feeling that everyday reality was slipping through her fingers.</t3582><t3583>Before, she thought, children took a long time to grow up.</t3583><t3584>One only had to remember all the time it took for José Arcadio, the eldest, to go with the gypsies, and everything that happened before he returned painted like a snake and speaking like an astronomer, and the things that happened in the house before Amaranta and Arcadio forgot the Indian language and learned Spanish.</t3584><t3585>You had to see the sun and rain endured by poor José Arcadio Buendía under the chestnut tree, and all the mourning for his death before they carried a dying Colonel Aureliano Buendía who, after so much war and suffering for him, was still not fifty years old.</t3585><t3586>In another era, after spending all day making little caramel animals, she still had time to take care of the children, to see in the whites of their eyes that they needed a potion of castor oil.</t3586><t3587>But now, when she had nothing to do and walked around with José Arcadio straddling her hip from dawn to night, the poor quality of time forced her to leave things unfinished.</t3587><t3588>The truth was that Úrsula resisted aging even though she had lost count of her age, and she was in the way everywhere, and tried to get involved in everything, and annoyed visitors with questions about whether they had left a plaster Saint Joseph in the house during the war to keep it safe from the rain.</t3588><t3589>Nobody knew for sure when she started losing her sight.</t3589><t3590>Even in her last years, when she could no longer get out of bed, it simply seemed that she was overcome by decrepitude, but no one discovered that she was blind.</t3590><t3591>She had noticed it before José Arcadio's birth.</t3591><t3592>At first, she thought it was a temporary weakness and secretly took marrow syrup and put honey in her eyes, but very soon she became convinced that she was sinking irretrievably into darkness, to the point that she never had a clear notion of the invention of electric light, because when the first bulbs were installed, she only managed to perceive the glow.</t3592><t3593>She didn't tell anyone, as it would have been a public acknowledgment of her uselessness.</t3593><t3594>She committed to a silent learning of the distances of things and people's voices, to keep seeing with her memory when the shadows of cataracts no longer allowed her to.</t3594><t3595>Later, she discovered the unexpected help of smells, which defined themselves in the darkness with a force much more convincing than volumes and color, and they definitively saved her from the shame of surrender.</t3595><t3596>In the darkness of the room, she could thread a needle and sew a buttonhole, and she knew when the milk was about to boil.</t3596><t3597>She knew so surely the place of each thing that she sometimes forgot she was blind.</t3597><t3598>Once, Fernanda stirred up the house because she had lost her wedding ring, and Úrsula found it on a shelf in the children's bedroom.</t3598><t3599>Simply, while the others wandered carelessly everywhere, she watched them with her four senses so they would never catch her by surprise, and after some time, she discovered that each family member repeated the same routes, the same acts, and almost the same words at the same time every day.</t3599><t3600>Only when they deviated from that meticulous routine did they risk losing something.</t3600><t3601>So when she heard Fernanda distressed because she had lost the ring, Úrsula remembered that the only different thing she had done that day was to sun the children's mats because Meme had found a bedbug the night before.</t3601><t3602>Since the children attended the cleaning, Úrsula thought that Fernanda had placed the ring in the only place they couldn't reach: the shelf.</t3602><t3603>Fernanda, on the other hand, only searched in the paths of her daily itinerary, not knowing that the search for lost things is hindered by routine habits, and that is why it is so hard to find them.</t3603>
<t3604>The upbringing of José Arcadio helped Úrsula in the exhausting task of keeping up with the slightest changes in the house.</t3604> <t3605>When she noticed that Amaranta was dressing the saints in the bedroom, she pretended to teach the child the differences in colors.</t3605>
<t3606>—Let's see —he said to him—, tell me what color Saint Raphael the Archangel is dressed in.</t3606>
<t3607>In that way, the child gave him the information that his eyes denied him, and long before he went to the seminary, Úrsula could already distinguish the different colors of the saints' clothes by their texture.</t3607> <t3608>Sometimes unforeseen accidents occurred.</t3608> <t3609>One afternoon, Amaranta was embroidering in the begonia corridor, and Úrsula stumbled upon her.</t3609>
<t3610>—For the love of God —protested Amaranta—, watch where you're walking.</t3610>
<t3611>—It is you —said Úrsula—, who is sitting where you should not be.</t3611>
<t3612>For her, it was true.</t3612><t3613>But that day she began to realize something that no one had discovered, and it was that over the course of the year the sun was imperceptibly changing position, and those who sat in the corridor had to gradually change places without noticing it.</t3613><t3614>From then on, Úrsula only had to remember the date to know the exact place where Amaranta was sitting.</t3614><t3615>Although the trembling of her hands was increasingly noticeable and she couldn't bear the weight of her feet, her tiny figure was never seen in so many places at the same time.</t3615><t3616>She was almost as diligent as when she carried the entire weight of the house on her shoulders.</t3616><t3617>However, in the impenetrable solitude of decrepitude, she had such clairvoyance to examine even the most insignificant events of the family, that for the first time she clearly saw the truths that her past occupations had prevented her from seeing.</t3617><t3618>By the time they were preparing José Arcadio for the seminary, she had already made an infinitesimal recapitulation of the house's life since the founding of Macondo, and had completely changed her opinion of her descendants.</t3618><t3619>She realized that Colonel Aureliano Buendía had not lost his affection for the family due to the hardening effects of war, as she had previously thought, but that he had never loved anyone, not even his wife Remedios or the countless one-night women who passed through his life, and much less his children.</t3619><t3620>She glimpsed that he had not fought so many wars out of idealism, as everyone believed, nor had he renounced imminent victory out of exhaustion, as everyone believed, but that he had won and lost for the same reason, out of pure and sinful pride.</t3620><t3621>She concluded that the son for whom she would have given her life was simply a man incapable of love.</t3621><t3622>One night, when she had him in her womb, she heard him cry.</t3622><t3623>It was such a defined lament that José Arcadio Buendía woke up beside her and rejoiced at the idea that the child was going to be a ventriloquist.</t3623><t3624>Other people predicted he would be a seer.</t3624><t3625>She, on the other hand, shuddered with the certainty that that deep bellow was the first indication of the dreaded pig's tail, and she prayed to God to let the child die in her womb.</t3625><t3626>But the lucidity of decrepitude allowed her to see, and she repeated it many times, that the crying of children in the mother's womb is not a sign of ventriloquism or divinatory ability, but an unequivocal sign of incapacity for love.</t3626><t3627>That devaluation of her son's image suddenly aroused all the compassion she owed him.</t3627><t3628>Amaranta, on the other hand, whose hardness of heart frightened her, whose concentrated bitterness embittered her, was clarified in the final examination as the most tender woman who had ever existed, and she understood with pitiful clairvoyance that the unjust tortures she had subjected Pietro Crespi to were not dictated by a will for revenge, as everyone believed, nor was the slow martyrdom with which she frustrated the life of Colonel Gerineldo Márquez determined by the bad bile of her bitterness, as everyone believed, but that both actions had been a life-and-death struggle between a boundless love and an invincible cowardice, and that the irrational fear Amaranta always had of her own tormented heart had finally triumphed.</t3628><t3629>It was around that time that Úrsula began to mention Rebeca, to evoke her with an old affection exalted by late repentance and sudden admiration, having understood that only she, Rebeca, who never fed on her milk but on the earth, the earth and the lime of the walls, who did not carry in her veins blood of her blood but the unknown blood of the unknown whose bones continued to cluck in the grave, Rebeca, the one with the impatient heart, the one with the unrestrained belly, was the only one who had the unbridled courage that Úrsula had wished for her lineage.</t3629>
<t3630>—Rebeca —he said, feeling the walls—, how unfair we have been to you!</t3630>
<t3631>In the house, they simply believed that she was raving, especially since she started walking around with her right arm raised, like the archangel Gabriel.</t3631> <t3632>Fernanda, however, realized that there was a sun of clairvoyance in the shadows of that delirium, as Úrsula could say without hesitation how much money had been spent in the house during the last year.</t3632> <t3633>Amaranta had a similar idea one day when her mother was stirring a pot of soup in the kitchen, and suddenly said, without knowing she was being heard, that the corn mill they bought from the first gypsies, which had disappeared before José Arcadio had circled the world sixty-five times, was still in Pilar Ternera's house.</t3633> <t3634>Also almost a centenarian, but whole and agile despite the inconceivable fatness that scared children as her laughter once scared pigeons, Pilar Ternera was not surprised by Úrsula's accuracy, because her own experience was beginning to indicate that an alert old age can be more accurate than the inquiries of cards.</t3634>
<t3635>However, when Úrsula realized that she hadn't had enough time to consolidate José Arcadio's vocation, she was stunned by consternation.</t3635> <t3636>She began to make mistakes, trying to see with her eyes the things that intuition allowed her to see more clearly.</t3636> <t3637>One morning she poured the contents of an inkwell over the child's head, thinking it was Florida water.</t3637> <t3638>She caused so many mishaps with her stubbornness to intervene in everything that she felt disturbed by bursts of bad temper, and she tried to shake off the darkness that was finally entangling her like a nightgown of cobwebs.</t3638> <t3639>It was then that she thought her clumsiness was not the first victory of decrepitude and darkness, but a flaw in time.</t3639> <t3640>She thought that before, when God didn't play the same tricks with months and years that the Turks did when measuring a yard of calico, things were different.</t3640> <t3641>Now not only did children grow faster, but even feelings evolved differently.</t3641> <t3642>No sooner had Remedios the Beauty ascended to heaven in body and soul, than the inconsiderate Fernanda was already grumbling in the corners because she had taken the sheets.</t3642> <t3643>No sooner had the bodies of the Aurelianos cooled in their graves, than Aureliano Segundo had the house lit up again, full of drunkards playing the accordion and soaking themselves in champagne, as if Christians hadn't died but dogs, and as if that madhouse that had cost so many headaches and so many little caramel animals, was destined to become a garbage dump of perdition.</t3643> <t3644>Remembering these things while they were packing José Arcadio's trunk, Úrsula wondered if it wouldn't be better to lie down in the grave once and for all and have the earth thrown over her, and she asked God, without fear, if He really thought people were made of iron to endure so much sorrow and mortification; and asking and asking, she stoked her own bewilderment, and felt an irrepressible desire to start ranting like a stranger, and to finally allow herself a moment of rebellion, the moment so often longed for and so often postponed of shoving resignation up her fundament and shitting on everything once and for all, and getting out of her heart the infinite heaps of bad words she had had to swallow in a whole century of conformity.</t3644>
<t3645>—Damn it! —he shouted.</t3645>
<t3646>Amaranta, who was starting to put the clothes into the trunk, thought she had been stung by a scorpion.</t3646>
<t3647>—Where is it? —she asked alarmed.</t3647>
<t3648>—What?</t3648>
<t3649>—The animal! —clarified Amaranta.</t3649>
<t3650>Úrsula put a finger on her heart.</t3650>
<t3651>—Here —he said.</t3651>
<t3652>One Thursday at two in the afternoon, José Arcadio went to the seminary.</t3652> <t3653>Úrsula would always evoke him as she imagined him when she said goodbye, languid and serious and without shedding a tear, as she had taught him, suffocating from the heat inside the green corduroy suit with copper buttons and a starched bow at the neck.</t3653> <t3654>He left the dining room impregnated with the penetrating fragrance of Florida water that she poured on his head so she could follow his trail in the house.</t3654> <t3655>During the farewell lunch, the family concealed their nervousness with expressions of joy and celebrated Father Antonio Isabel's occurrences with exaggerated enthusiasm.</t3655> <t3656>But when they took away the velvet-lined trunk with silver corners, it was as if they had taken a coffin out of the house.</t3656> <t3657>The only one who refused to participate in the farewell was Colonel Aureliano Buendía.</t3657>
<t3658>—This was the last thing we needed —he grumbled—: A Pope!</t3658>
<t3659>Three months later, Aureliano Segundo and Fernanda took Meme to school, and returned with a clavichord that took the place of the pianola.</t3659> <t3660>It was around that time that Amaranta began to weave her own shroud.</t3660> <t3661>The banana fever had subsided.</t3661> <t3662>The old inhabitants of Macondo found themselves cornered by the newcomers, clinging laboriously to their precarious resources of yesteryear, but comforted in any case by the impression of having survived a shipwreck.</t3662> <t3663>In the house, they continued to receive guests for lunch, and in reality, the old routine was not restored until the banana company left years later.</t3663> <t3664>However, there were radical changes in the traditional sense of hospitality, because it was then Fernanda who imposed her laws.</t3664> <t3665>With Úrsula relegated to the shadows, and Amaranta absorbed in the task of the shroud, the former apprentice queen had the freedom to select the diners and impose the rigid rules instilled by her parents.</t3665> <t3666>Her severity turned the house into a stronghold of outdated customs, in a town convulsed by the vulgarity with which the outsiders squandered their easy fortunes.</t3666> <t3667>For her, without further ado, decent people were those who had nothing to do with the banana company.</t3667> <t3668>Even José Arcadio Segundo, her brother-in-law, fell victim to her discriminatory zeal, because in the excitement of the early days, he once again auctioned off his splendid fighting cocks and took a job as a foreman in the banana company.</t3668>
<t3669>—Do not set foot in this home again —said Fernanda—, as long as you have the outsider's scabies.</t3669>
<t3670>The restrictions imposed in the house were so severe that Aureliano Segundo felt definitively more comfortable at Petra Cotes' place.</t3670><t3671>First, under the pretext of easing his wife's burden, he moved the parties.</t3671><t3672>Then, under the pretext that the animals were losing fertility, he moved the stables and barns.</t3672><t3673>Finally, under the pretext that it was cooler at the concubine's house, he moved the small office where he managed his business.</t3673><t3674>When Fernanda realized that she was a widow whose husband had not yet died, it was too late for things to return to their previous state.</t3674><t3675>Aureliano Segundo barely ate at home, and the only appearances he maintained, such as sleeping with his wife, were not enough to convince anyone.</t3675><t3676>One night, by accident, morning found him in Petra Cotes' bed.</t3676><t3677>Contrary to what he expected, Fernanda did not reproach him in the slightest nor did she show the least sign of resentment, but that same day she sent his two trunks of clothes to the concubine's house.</t3677><t3678>She sent them in broad daylight with instructions to carry them down the middle of the street, so that everyone could see them, believing that the wayward husband would not be able to bear the shame and would return to the fold with his head bowed.</t3678><t3679>But that heroic gesture was just another proof of how little Fernanda knew not only her husband's character but also the nature of a community that had nothing to do with that of her parents, because everyone who saw the trunks pass by thought that after all, this was the natural culmination of a story whose intimacies no one was unaware of, and Aureliano Segundo celebrated his newfound freedom with a three-day party.</t3679><t3680>To the further disadvantage of the wife, while she began to age poorly with her somber clerical garments, her anachronistic medallions, and her misplaced pride, the concubine seemed to burst into a second youth, clad in bright natural silk dresses and with eyes blazing with the fire of vindication.</t3680><t3681>Aureliano Segundo returned to her with the fervor of adolescence, as before, when Petra Cotes loved him not for who he was but because she confused him with his twin brother, and by sleeping with both at the same time, she thought that God had granted her the fortune of having a man who made love as if he were two.</t3681><t3682>The restored passion was so urgent that more than once they looked into each other's eyes as they were about to eat, and without saying a word, they covered the plates and went to die of hunger and love in the bedroom.</t3682><t3683>Inspired by the things he had seen on his furtive visits to the French matrons, Aureliano Segundo bought Petra Cotes a bed with an archbishop's canopy, put velvet curtains on the windows, and covered the ceiling and walls of the bedroom with large rock crystal mirrors.</t3683><t3684>He was then seen more partying and extravagant than ever.</t3684><t3685>On the train, which arrived every day at eleven, he received box after box of champagne and brandy.</t3685><t3686>On the way back from the station, he dragged every human being he encountered, native or foreigner, known or unknown, without any distinctions, to the improvised cumbiamba.</t3686><t3687>Even the elusive Mr. Brown, who only mingled in a foreign language, was seduced by the tempting gestures Aureliano Segundo made to him, and several times he got dead drunk at Petra Cotes' house and even made the fierce German dogs that accompanied him everywhere dance to Texan songs that he himself mumbled in any way to the rhythm of the accordion.</t3687>
<t3688>—Move aside, cows —Aureliano Segundo shouted in the frenzy of the party—.</t3688> <t3689>Move aside because life is short.</t3689>
<t3690>He never looked better, nor was he more loved, nor was the birthing of his animals more frenzied.</t3690><t3691>So many cattle, pigs, and chickens were sacrificed in the endless parties that the ground in the yard turned black and muddy from so much blood.</t3691><t3692>It was an eternal dumping ground of bones and guts, a refuse heap of leftovers, and they had to be burning dynamite chambers at all hours to keep the vultures from gouging out the guests' eyes.</t3692><t3693>Aureliano Segundo became fat, purplish, and sluggish as a result of an appetite barely comparable to that of José Arcadio when he returned from his trip around the world.</t3693><t3694>The prestige of his unrestrained voracity, his immense capacity for wastefulness, and his unprecedented hospitality surpassed the limits of the swamp and attracted the best-rated gluttons from the coast.</t3694><t3695>From all over, fabulous gluttons arrived to take part in the irrational tournaments of capacity and endurance that were organized at Petra Cotes' house.</t3695><t3696>Aureliano Segundo was the undefeated eater until the unfortunate Saturday when Camila Sagastume appeared, a totemic female known throughout the country by the good name of The Elephant.</t3696><t3697>The duel lasted until dawn on Tuesday.</t3697><t3698>In the first twenty-four hours, having dispatched a calf with yucca, yam, and roasted plantains, and additionally a box and a half of champagne, Aureliano Segundo was confident of victory.</t3698><t3699>He seemed more enthusiastic, more vital than the imperturbable adversary, who had an evidently more professional style, but for that reason less exciting to the colorful crowd that overflowed the house.</t3699><t3700>While Aureliano Segundo ate in bites, driven by the anxiety of triumph, The Elephant sectioned the meat with the skills of a surgeon, and ate it unhurriedly and even with a certain pleasure.</t3700><t3701>She was gigantic and solid, but against her colossal corpulence prevailed the tenderness of femininity, and she had such a beautiful face, such fine and well-cared-for hands, and such irresistible personal charm, that when Aureliano Segundo saw her enter the house, he commented in a low voice that he would have preferred to hold the tournament in bed rather than at the table.</t3701><t3702>Later, when he saw her consume the calf's haunch without violating a single rule of the best manners, he seriously commented that this delicate, fascinating, and insatiable proboscidean was in some way the ideal woman.</t3702><t3703>He was not mistaken.</t3703><t3704>The bone-crushing fame that preceded The Elephant was unfounded.</t3704><t3705>She was not an ox crusher, nor a bearded woman in a Greek circus, as was said, but the director of a singing academy.</t3705><t3706>She had learned to eat already being a respectable mother of a family, seeking a method for her children to eat better, not through artificial appetite stimulants but through absolute peace of mind.</t3706><t3707>Her theory, demonstrated in practice, was based on the principle that a person who had perfectly settled all matters of their conscience could eat without pause until overcome by fatigue.</t3707><t3708>So it was for moral reasons, and not for sporting interest, that she neglected the academy and home to compete with a man whose fame as a great, unprincipled eater had spread across the country.</t3708><t3709>From the first time she saw him, she realized that Aureliano Segundo would not be undone by his stomach but by his character.</t3709><t3710>At the end of the first night, while The Elephant remained impassive, Aureliano Segundo was exhausted from so much talking and laughing.</t3710><t3711>They slept for four hours.</t3711><t3712>Upon waking, each drank the juice of fifty oranges, eight liters of coffee, and thirty raw eggs.</t3712><t3713>By the second dawn, after many hours without sleep and having dispatched two pigs, a bunch of plantains, and four boxes of champagne, The Elephant suspected that Aureliano Segundo, unknowingly, had discovered the same method as she had, but through the absurd path of total irresponsibility.</t3713><t3714>He was, therefore, more dangerous than she had thought.</t3714><t3715>However, when Petra Cotes brought two roasted turkeys to the table, Aureliano Segundo was on the verge of congestion.</t3715>
<t3716>—If you can't, don't eat any more —said The Elephant—.</t3716> <t3717>We're tied.</t3717>
<t3718>She said it from the heart, understanding that she too could not eat another bite due to the remorse of facilitating the death of the adversary.</t3718> <t3719>But Aureliano Segundo interpreted it as a new challenge, and he stuffed himself with turkey beyond his incredible capacity.</t3719> <t3720>He lost consciousness.</t3720> <t3721>He fell face-first into the plate of bones, foaming at the mouth like a dog, and choking on agonizing snores.</t3721> <t3722>In the midst of the darkness, he felt as if he were being thrown from the top of a tower into a bottomless abyss, and in a final flash of lucidity, he realized that at the end of that endless fall, death was waiting for him.</t3722>
<t3723>—Take me to Fernanda —he managed to say.</t3723>
<t3724>The friends who left him at the house believed that he had fulfilled his promise to his wife not to die in the concubine's bed.</t3724> <t3725>Petra Cotes had polished the patent leather boots that he wanted to wear in the coffin, and she was already looking for someone to take them when they came to tell her that Aureliano Segundo was out of danger.</t3725> <t3726>He recovered, in fact, in less than a week, and fifteen days later he was celebrating the event of his survival with an unprecedented party.</t3726> <t3727>He continued living in Petra Cotes' house, but he visited Fernanda every day and sometimes stayed to eat with the family, as if fate had reversed the situation, leaving him as the husband of the concubine and the lover of the wife.</t3727>
<t3728>It was a relief for Fernanda.</t3728> <t3729>In the tedium of abandonment, her only distractions were clavichord exercises during siesta time and letters from her children.</t3729> <t3730>In the detailed notes she sent them every fifteen days, there was not a single line of truth.</t3730> <t3731>She hid her sorrows from them.</t3731> <t3732>She concealed the sadness of a house that, despite the light over the begonias, despite the suffocation of two in the afternoon, despite the frequent bursts of festivity that came from the street, was increasingly resembling the colonial mansion of her parents.</t3732> <t3733>Fernanda wandered alone among three living ghosts and the dead ghost of José Arcadio Buendía, who sometimes sat with an inquisitive attention in the dimness of the living room while she played the clavichord.</t3733> <t3734>Colonel Aureliano Buendía was a shadow.</t3734> <t3735>Since the last time he went out to propose a futile war to Colonel Gerineldo Márquez, he barely left the workshop except to urinate under the chestnut tree.</t3735> <t3736>He received no other visitors than the barber every three weeks.</t3736> <t3737>He fed on whatever Úrsula brought him once a day, and although he continued making little gold fishes with the same passion as before, he stopped selling them when he found out that people were not buying them as jewelry but as historical relics.</t3737> <t3738>He had made a bonfire in the yard with Remedios' dolls, which had decorated his bedroom since the day of their marriage.</t3738> <t3739>The vigilant Úrsula realized what her son was doing, but she could not stop him.</t3739>
<t3740>—You have a heart of stone —he told her.</t3740>
<t3741>—This is not a matter of the heart —he said—.</t3741> <t3742>The room is filling up with moths.</t3742>
<t3743>Amaranta was weaving her shroud.</t3743> <t3744>Fernanda did not understand why she wrote occasional letters to Meme, and even sent her gifts, yet did not even want to talk about José Arcadio.</t3744> <t3745>“They will die without knowing why,” Amaranta answered when she asked her the question through Úrsula, and that response planted an enigma in her heart that she could never unravel.</t3745> <t3746>Tall, slender, haughty, always dressed in abundant frothy petticoats and with an air of distinction that resisted the years and bad memories, Amaranta seemed to bear the ash cross of virginity on her forehead.</t3746> <t3747>In reality, she bore it in her hand, in the black bandage that she did not remove even to sleep, and which she herself washed and ironed.</t3747> <t3748>Her life was spent embroidering the shroud.</t3748> <t3749>One might have said that she embroidered during the day and unembroidered at night, not with the hope of defeating loneliness in that way, but quite the opposite, to sustain it.</t3749>
<t3750>The greatest concern Fernanda had during her years of abandonment was that Meme would come home for her first vacation and not find Aureliano Segundo in the house.</t3750> <t3751>The congestion put an end to that fear.</t3751> <t3752>When Meme returned, her parents had agreed not only to make the girl believe that Aureliano Segundo was still a domesticated husband, but also to ensure she did not notice the sadness in the house.</t3752> <t3753>Every year, for two months, Aureliano Segundo played his role as an exemplary husband and organized parties with ice cream and cookies, which the cheerful and lively student enlivened with the clavichord.</t3753> <t3754>It was evident from then on that she had inherited very little of her mother's character.</t3754> <t3755>She seemed more like a second version of Amaranta, when she did not yet know bitterness and would stir up the house with her dance steps, at twelve, at fourteen years old, before the secret passion for Pietro Crespi definitively twisted the course of her heart.</t3755> <t3756>But unlike Amaranta, unlike everyone else, Meme did not yet reveal the solitary fate of the family, and seemed entirely content with the world, even when she locked herself in the living room at two in the afternoon to practice the clavichord with inflexible discipline.</t3756> <t3757>It was evident that she liked the house, that she spent the whole year dreaming of the commotion of teenagers that her arrival caused, and that she was not far from the festive vocation and hospitable excesses of her father.</t3757> <t3758>The first sign of that calamitous inheritance was revealed during the third vacation, when Meme appeared at the house with four nuns and sixty-eight classmates, whom she invited to spend a week with the family, on her own initiative and without any prior announcement.</t3758>
<t3759>—What a misfortune! —lamented Fernanda—.</t3759> <t3760>This child is as barbaric as her father!</t3760>
<t3761>It was necessary to ask the neighbors for beds and hammocks, establish nine meal shifts, set bath schedules, and borrow forty stools so that the girls in blue uniforms and men's boots wouldn't spend the whole day fluttering from one side to the other.</t3761> <t3762>The invitation was a failure because the noisy schoolgirls had barely finished breakfast when they already had to start the shifts for lunch, and then for dinner, and in the whole week they could only take one walk to the plantations.</t3762> <t3763>At dusk, the nuns were exhausted, unable to move, to give another order, and still the horde of tireless adolescents was in the courtyard singing dull school hymns.</t3763> <t3764>One day they almost ran over Úrsula, who insisted on being useful precisely where she was most in the way.</t3764> <t3765>Another day, the nuns raised a commotion because Colonel Aureliano Buendía urinated under the chestnut tree without worrying that the schoolgirls were in the courtyard.</t3765> <t3766>Amaranta almost caused a panic because one of the nuns entered the kitchen when she was salting the soup, and the only thing that occurred to her was to ask what those handfuls of white powder were.</t3766>
<t3767>—Arsenic —said Amaranta.</t3767>
<t3768>The night of their arrival, the students got so tangled up trying to go to the toilet before going to bed that by one in the morning, the last ones were still entering.</t3768> <t3769>Fernanda then bought seventy-two chamber pots, but she only managed to turn the nighttime problem into a morning problem, because from dawn there was a long line of girls in front of the toilet, each with her chamber pot in hand, waiting for their turn to wash it.</t3769> <t3770>Although some suffered from fevers and several had mosquito bites that got infected, the majority showed unbreakable resilience in the face of the most painful difficulties, and even during the hottest hours, they ran around in the garden.</t3770> <t3771>When they finally left, the flowers were destroyed, the furniture was broken, and the walls were covered with drawings and graffiti, but Fernanda forgave the damage in the relief of their departure.</t3771> <t3772>She returned the borrowed beds and stools and stored the seventy-two chamber pots in Melquíades' room.</t3772> <t3773>The sealed room, around which the spiritual life of the house once revolved, was known from then on as the chamber pot room.</t3773> <t3774>For Colonel Aureliano Buendía, that was the most appropriate name, because while the rest of the family continued to be amazed that Melquíades' room was immune to dust and destruction, he saw it turned into a dump.</t3774> <t3775>Anyway, he didn't seem to care who was right, and if he found out about the room's fate, it was because Fernanda spent an entire afternoon passing by and disturbing his work to store the chamber pots.</t3775>
<t3776>In those days, José Arcadio Segundo reappeared in the house.</t3776> <t3777>He would walk through the corridor without greeting anyone and lock himself in the workshop to converse with the colonel.</t3777> <t3778>Even though she couldn't see him, Úrsula analyzed the clicking of his foreman's boots and was surprised by the insurmountable distance that separated him from the family, even from his twin brother with whom he had played clever games of confusion in childhood and with whom he no longer shared any common traits.</t3778> <t3779>He was linear, solemn, and had a thoughtful demeanor, a Saracen's sadness, and a gloomy glow on his autumn-colored face.</t3779> <t3780>He was the one who most resembled his mother, Santa Sofía de la Piedad.</t3780> <t3781>Úrsula reproached herself for the tendency to forget about him when talking about the family, but when she felt him in the house again and noticed that the colonel admitted him into the workshop during working hours, she reexamined her old memories and confirmed the belief that at some point in childhood he had switched places with his twin brother, because it was he and not the other who should have been named Aureliano.</t3781> <t3782>Nobody knew the details of his life.</t3782> <t3783>At one time, it was known that he didn't have a fixed residence, that he raised roosters at Pilar Ternera's house, and that sometimes he stayed there to sleep, but that he almost always spent the night in the rooms of the French matrons.</t3783> <t3784>He wandered aimlessly, without affections, without ambitions, like a wandering star in Úrsula's planetary system.</t3784>
<t3785>In reality, José Arcadio Segundo was not a member of the family, nor would he ever be of another, since the distant dawn when Colonel Gerineldo Márquez took him to the barracks, not to witness an execution, but so that he would never forget for the rest of his life the sad and slightly mocking smile of the executed man.</t3785> <t3786>That was not only his oldest memory, but the only one from his childhood.</t3786> <t3787>The other, of an old man with an anachronistic vest and a hat with crow wings who told wonders in front of a dazzling window, he could not place in any time period.</t3787> <t3788>It was an uncertain memory, entirely devoid of lessons or nostalgia, unlike the memory of the executed man, which had actually defined the course of his life and returned to his mind increasingly clearer as he aged, as if the passage of time had brought it closer.</t3788> <t3789>Úrsula tried to make use of José Arcadio Segundo to get Colonel Aureliano Buendía to abandon his seclusion.</t3789> <t3790>“Convince him to go to the movies,” she would say.</t3790> <t3791>“Even if he doesn't like the films, at least he will have a chance to breathe fresh air.”</t3791> <t3792>But she soon realized that he was as insensitive to her pleas as the Colonel could have been, and that they were armored by the same impermeability to affections.</t3792> <t3793>Although she never knew, nor did anyone, what they talked about in the prolonged seclusions of the workshop, she understood that they were the only members of the family who seemed linked by affinities.</t3793>
<t3794>The truth is that not even José Arcadio Segundo could have gotten the colonel out of his seclusion.</t3794><t3795>The school invasion had exceeded the limits of his patience.</t3795><t3796>With the pretext that the bridal bedroom was at the mercy of moths despite the destruction of Remedios' appetizing dolls, he hung a hammock in the workshop, and then he only left it to go to the patio to relieve himself.</t3796><t3797>Úrsula couldn't manage to stitch together a trivial conversation with him.</t3797><t3798>She knew that he didn't look at the plates of food, but placed them at one end of the counter while he finished the little fish, and didn't care if the soup got a skin on it and the meat got cold.</t3798><t3799>He hardened more and more since Colonel Gerineldo Márquez refused to support him in a senile war.</t3799><t3800>He locked himself up with a bar inside himself, and the family ended up thinking of him as if he were dead.</t3800><t3801>He wasn't seen to have a human reaction again until an October eleventh when he went out to the street door to see a circus parade.</t3801><t3802>That day had been for Colonel Aureliano Buendía a day like all the others in his later years.</t3802><t3803>At five in the morning, he was awakened by the commotion of frogs and crickets outside the wall.</t3803><t3804>The drizzle had persisted since Saturday, and he wouldn't have needed to hear its meticulous whispering on the garden leaves, because he would have felt it in the cold of his bones anyway.</t3804><t3805>He was, as always, wrapped in the wool blanket, and with the long raw cotton underwear that he continued to wear for comfort, although because of their dusty anachronism he himself called them "Gothic underwear."</t3805><t3806>He put on his narrow pants, but didn't fasten the loops or put the gold button he always used on the collar of his shirt, because he intended to take a bath.</t3806><t3807>Then he put the blanket over his head like a hood, combed his dripping mustache with his fingers, and went to urinate in the patio.</t3807><t3808>It was so early that José Arcadio Buendía was still dozing under the shed of palms rotted by the drizzle.</t3808><t3809>He didn't see him, as he had never seen him, nor did he hear the incomprehensible phrase that his father's ghost addressed to him when he woke up startled by the stream of hot urine that splashed his shoes.</t3809><t3810>He postponed the bath for later, not because of the cold and humidity, but because of the oppressive October fog.</t3810><t3811>Returning to the workshop, he perceived the smell of wick from the stoves that Santa Sofía de la Piedad was lighting, and waited in the kitchen for the coffee to boil to take his cup without sugar.</t3811><t3812>Santa Sofía de la Piedad asked him, as she did every morning, what day of the week it was, and he replied that it was Tuesday, October eleventh.</t3812><t3813>Seeing the impassive woman gilded by the glow of the fire, who neither at that moment nor at any other in her life seemed to exist completely, he suddenly remembered that on an October eleventh, in the middle of the war, he was awakened by the brutal certainty that the woman he had slept with was dead.</t3813><t3814>She was, in fact, and he didn't forget the date because she too had asked him an hour earlier what day it was.</t3814><t3815>Despite the recollection, this time too he wasn't aware of how much the omens had abandoned him, and while the coffee boiled, he continued thinking out of pure curiosity, but without the slightest risk of nostalgia, about the woman whose name he never knew, and whose face he didn't see alive because she had reached his hammock stumbling in the dark.</t3815><t3816>However, in the void of so many women who came into his life in the same way, he didn't remember that it was she who, in the delirium of their first encounter, was about to drown in her own tears, and barely an hour before dying had sworn to love him until death.</t3816><t3817>He didn't think of her again, nor of any other, after he entered the workshop with the steaming cup, and turned on the light to count the little gold fish he kept in a tin can.</t3817><t3818>There were seventeen.</t3818><t3819>Since he decided not to sell them, he continued making two little fish a day, and when he completed twenty-five, he melted them down in the crucible to start making them again.</t3819><t3820>He worked all morning, absorbed, without thinking about anything, without realizing that at ten the rain intensified and someone passed in front of the workshop shouting to close the doors so the house wouldn't flood, and without even realizing himself until Úrsula came in with lunch and turned off the light.</t3820>
<t3821>—What rain! —said Úrsula.</t3821>
<t3822>—October —he said.</t3822>
<t3823>When he said it, he did not lift his gaze from the first little fish of the day, because he was setting the rubies in its eyes.</t3823> <t3824>Only when he finished it and placed it with the others in the jar did he start to eat the soup.</t3824> <t3825>Then he ate, very slowly, the piece of meat stewed with onions, the white rice, and the slices of fried plantain, all together on the same plate.</t3825> <t3826>His appetite was unaffected by either the best or the harshest circumstances.</t3826> <t3827>At the end of lunch, he experienced the anxiety of idleness.</t3827> <t3828>Due to a kind of scientific superstition, he never worked, read, bathed, or made love before two hours of digestion had passed, and this belief was so ingrained that he had several times delayed military operations to avoid exposing the troops to the risks of congestion.</t3828> <t3829>So he lay down in the hammock, cleaning the wax from his ears with a penknife, and within a few minutes, he fell asleep.</t3829> <t3830>He dreamed that he was entering an empty house with white walls, and he was troubled by the burden of being the first human being to enter it.</t3830> <t3831>In the dream, he remembered that he had dreamed the same thing the night before and on many nights over the past years, and he knew that the image would have been erased from his memory upon waking, because that recurring dream had the virtue of being remembered only within the dream itself.</t3831> <t3832>A moment later, indeed, when the barber knocked on the workshop door, Colonel Aureliano Buendía woke up with the impression that he had involuntarily fallen asleep for a few seconds and had not had time to dream anything.</t3832>
<t3833>—Not today —he said to the barber—.</t3833> <t3834>See you on Friday.</t3834>
<t3835>He had a three-day beard, speckled with white fuzz, but he didn't think it necessary to shave if he was going to get a haircut on Friday and could do it all at once.</t3835> <t3836>The sticky sweat from the unwanted nap revived the scars of the boils under his armpits.</t3836> <t3837>It had cleared up, but the sun had not yet come out.</t3837> <t3838>Colonel Aureliano Buendía let out a loud burp that brought back the acidity of the soup to his palate, and which was like an order from his body to throw the blanket over his shoulders and go to the toilet.</t3838> <t3839>There he stayed longer than necessary, squatting over the dense fermentation rising from the wooden box, until habit told him it was time to resume work.</t3839> <t3840>During the wait, he remembered again that it was Tuesday, and that José Arcadio Segundo had not been in the workshop because it was payday at the banana company plantations.</t3840> <t3841>That memory, like all those of recent years, led him to think about the war without any particular reason.</t3841> <t3842>He remembered that Colonel Gerineldo Márquez had once promised to get him a horse with a white star on its forehead, and that it had never been mentioned again.</t3842> <t3843>Then he drifted into scattered episodes, but he recalled them without qualifying them, because by not being able to think of anything else, he had learned to think coldly, so that the unavoidable memories would not hurt any feelings.</t3843> <t3844>Back in the workshop, seeing that the air was starting to dry, he decided it was a good time to bathe, but Amaranta had beaten him to it.</t3844> <t3845>So he started the second little fish of the day.</t3845> <t3846>He was attaching the tail when the sun came out so strongly that the brightness cracked like a sloop.</t3846> <t3847>The air washed by the three-day drizzle filled with flying ants.</t3847> <t3848>Then he realized he wanted to urinate, and he was postponing it until he finished assembling the little fish.</t3848> <t3849>He was heading to the patio at ten past four when he heard the distant brass, the drumbeats, and the children's jubilation, and for the first time since his youth, he consciously stepped into a trap of nostalgia and relived the prodigious afternoon of gypsies when his father took him to see the ice.</t3849> <t3850>Santa Sofía de la Piedad abandoned what she was doing in the kitchen and ran to the door.</t3850>
<t3851>—It's the circus —he shouted.</t3851>
<t3852>Instead of going to the chestnut tree, Colonel Aureliano Buendía also went to the street door and mingled with the onlookers who were watching the parade.</t3852> <t3853>He saw a woman dressed in gold on the nape of an elephant.</t3853> <t3854>He saw a sad dromedary.</t3854> <t3855>He saw a bear dressed as a Dutch woman marking the rhythm of the music with a ladle and a saucepan.</t3855> <t3856>He saw the clowns doing somersaults at the tail end of the parade, and he saw the miserable face of his loneliness again when everything had passed, and only the luminous space on the street remained, and the air filled with flying ants, and a few onlookers peering into the abyss of uncertainty.</t3856> <t3857>Then he went to the chestnut tree, thinking about the circus, and while he urinated he tried to keep thinking about the circus, but he could no longer find the memory.</t3857> <t3858>He tucked his head between his shoulders, like a little chick, and remained motionless with his forehead resting on the trunk of the chestnut tree.</t3858> <t3859>The family did not find out until the next day, at eleven in the morning, when Santa Sofía de la Piedad went to throw out the trash in the backyard and was struck by the sight of the buzzards descending.</t3859>
<t3860>Meme's last vacation coincided with the mourning for the death of Colonel Aureliano Buendía.</t3860> <t3861>In the closed house, there was no room for parties.</t3861> <t3862>People spoke in whispers, ate in silence, prayed the rosary three times a day, and even the clavichord exercises in the heat of the siesta had a funeral resonance.</t3862> <t3863>Despite her secret hostility towards the colonel, it was Fernanda who imposed the rigor of that mourning, impressed by the solemnity with which the government exalted the memory of the dead enemy.</t3863> <t3864>Aureliano Segundo returned as usual to sleep in the house while his daughter's vacation lasted, and Fernanda must have done something to regain her privileges as a legitimate wife, because the following year Meme found a newborn little sister, who was baptized, against the mother's will, with the name Amaranta Úrsula.</t3864>
<t3865>Meme had finished her studies.</t3865><t3866>The diploma that certified her as a harpsichord concert performer was ratified by the virtuosity with which she played popular 17th-century themes at the party organized to celebrate the completion of her studies and with which the mourning period was ended.</t3866><t3867>The guests admired, more than her art, her rare duality.</t3867><t3868>Her frivolous and even somewhat childish character did not seem suitable for any serious activity, but when she sat at the harpsichord she transformed into a different girl, whose unexpected maturity gave her an adult air.</t3868><t3869>It was always like that.</t3869><t3870>In truth, she did not have a defined vocation, but she achieved the highest grades through inflexible discipline, so as not to displease her mother.</t3870><t3871>They could have imposed the learning of any other trade on her, and the results would have been the same.</t3871><t3872>Since she was very young, she was bothered by Fernanda's strictness, her habit of deciding for others, and she would have been capable of a much harsher sacrifice than harpsichord lessons just to avoid clashing with her intransigence.</t3872><t3873>At the closing ceremony, she had the impression that the parchment with Gothic letters and historiated capitals freed her from a commitment she had accepted not so much out of obedience but out of convenience, and she believed that from then on not even the stubborn Fernanda would worry again about an instrument that even the nuns considered a museum fossil.</t3873><t3874>In the early years, she thought her calculations were wrong, because after having put half the town to sleep not only in the living room but at every charity event, school session, and patriotic commemoration held in Macondo, her mother continued inviting every newcomer she thought capable of appreciating her daughter's virtues.</t3874><t3875>Only after Amaranta's death, when the family shut themselves in mourning for a while, was Meme able to close the harpsichord and forget the key in any wardrobe, without Fernanda bothering to find out when or because of whom it had been lost.</t3875><t3876>Meme endured the exhibitions with the same stoicism with which she dedicated herself to learning.</t3876><t3877>It was the price of her freedom.</t3877><t3878>Fernanda was so pleased with her docility and so proud of the admiration her art aroused that she never opposed having the house full of friends, spending the afternoon in the plantations, and going to the movies with Aureliano Segundo or with trusted ladies, as long as the movie had been authorized from the pulpit by Father Antonio Isabel.</t3878><t3879>In those moments of leisure, Meme's true tastes were revealed.</t3879><t3880>Her happiness lay at the opposite end of discipline, in noisy parties, in lovers' gossip, in prolonged seclusions with her friends where they learned to smoke and talked about men's matters, and where once they went overboard with three bottles of cane rum and ended up naked, measuring and comparing parts of their bodies.</t3880><t3881>Meme would never forget the night she entered the house chewing licorice rhizomes, and without them noticing her condition, sat at the table where Fernanda and Amaranta dined without speaking to each other.</t3881><t3882>She had spent two terrible hours in a friend's bedroom, crying with laughter and fear, and on the other side of the crisis, she found the rare feeling of bravery she needed to run away from school and tell her mother in those or other words that she could well give herself a harpsichord enema.</t3882><t3883>Sitting at the head of the table, drinking chicken broth that fell into her stomach like an elixir of resurrection, Meme then saw Fernanda and Amaranta wrapped in the accusatory halo of reality.</t3883><t3884>She had to make a great effort not to throw in their faces their prudishness, their poverty of spirit, their delusions of grandeur.</t3884><t3885>Since the second vacation, she had learned that her father only lived in the house to keep up appearances, and knowing Fernanda as she did and having later managed to get to know Petra Cotes, she sided with her father.</t3885><t3886>She too would have preferred to be the daughter of the concubine.</t3886><t3887>In the stupor of alcohol, Meme thought with delight about the scandal that would have arisen if at that moment she had expressed her thoughts, and the intimate satisfaction of the mischief was so intense that Fernanda noticed it.</t3887>
<t3888>—What’s wrong? —he asked.</t3888>
<t3889>—Nothing —Meme replied—.</t3889> <t3890>That only now I discover how much I love them.</t3890>
<t3891>Amaranta was frightened by the evident load of hatred carried by the declaration.</t3891><t3892>But Fernanda was so moved that she thought she would go crazy when Meme woke up at midnight with her head split by pain and choking on bile vomit.</t3892><t3893>She gave her a bottle of castor oil, applied poultices to her abdomen and ice packs to her head, and forced her to follow the diet and five-day confinement ordered by the new and extravagant French doctor who, after examining her for more than two hours, came to the nebulous conclusion that she had a woman's disorder.</t3893><t3894>Abandoned by courage, in a miserable state of demoralization, Meme had no other recourse but to endure.</t3894><t3895>Úrsula, already completely blind but still active and lucid, was the only one who intuited the exact diagnosis.</t3895><t3896>"To me," she thought, "these are the same things that happen to drunkards."</t3896><t3897>But she not only rejected the idea, she reproached herself for the lightness of her thoughts.</t3897><t3898>Aureliano Segundo felt a pang of conscience when he saw Meme's state of prostration and promised himself to take better care of her in the future.</t3898><t3899>Thus was born the relationship of cheerful camaraderie between father and daughter, which freed him for a time from the bitter loneliness of his revelries and freed her from Fernanda's tutelage without having to provoke the domestic crisis that already seemed inevitable.</t3899><t3900>Aureliano Segundo would then postpone any commitment to be with Meme, to take her to the movies or the circus, and he dedicated most of his leisure time to her.</t3900><t3901>In recent times, the hindrance of absurd obesity that no longer allowed him to tie his shoelaces, and the abusive satisfaction of all kinds of appetites, had begun to sour his character.</t3901><t3902>The discovery of his daughter restored his old joviality, and the pleasure of being with her gradually drew him away from dissipation.</t3902><t3903>Meme was blossoming into a fruitful age.</t3903><t3904>She was not beautiful, as Amaranta never was, but she was charming, uncomplicated, and had the virtue of being likable from the first moment.</t3904><t3905>She had a modern spirit that hurt the outdated sobriety and poorly concealed miserly heart of Fernanda, which Aureliano Segundo, on the other hand, delighted in sponsoring.</t3905><t3906>He was the one who decided to move her out of the bedroom she had occupied since childhood, where the fearful eyes of the saints continued to feed her adolescent terrors, and furnished her a room with a throne-like bed, a large dresser, and velvet curtains, without realizing that he was making a second version of Petra Cotes's room.</t3906><t3907>He was so generous with Meme that he didn't even know how much money he provided her, because she would take it from his pockets herself, and kept her informed of every beautifying novelty that arrived at the banana company's commissaries.</t3907><t3908>Meme's room filled with pumice stone pads to polish her nails, hair curlers, tooth brighteners, eye drops to languish her gaze, and so many new cosmetics and beauty gadgets that every time Fernanda entered the bedroom, she was scandalized by the idea that her daughter's dresser must be like that of French matrons.</t3908><t3909>However, Fernanda was at that time dividing her time between little Amaranta Úrsula, who was capricious and sickly, and an exciting correspondence with the invisible doctors.</t3909><t3910>So when she noticed the complicity between father and daughter, the only promise she extracted from Aureliano Segundo was that he would never take Meme to Petra Cotes's house.</t3910><t3911>It was a meaningless warning because the concubine was so upset with her lover's camaraderie with his daughter that she wanted nothing to do with her.</t3911><t3912>She was tormented by an unknown fear, as if instinct told her that Meme, just by wishing it, could achieve what Fernanda could not: deprive her of a love she already considered assured until death.</t3912><t3913>For the first time, Aureliano Segundo had to endure the hard faces and virulent tirades of the concubine, and he even feared that his carried and brought trunks would make their way back to his wife's house.</t3913><t3914>This did not happen.</t3914><t3915>Nobody knew a man better than Petra Cotes knew her lover, and she knew that the trunks would stay where they were sent because if there was something Aureliano Segundo detested, it was complicating his life with rectifications and moves.</t3915><t3916>So the trunks stayed where they were, and Petra Cotes set out to win back her husband by sharpening the only weapons with which his daughter could not compete.</t3916><t3917>It was also an unnecessary effort because Meme never intended to interfere in her father's affairs, and surely if she had, it would have been in favor of the concubine.</t3917><t3918>She had no time to bother anyone.</t3918><t3919>She herself swept the bedroom and made the bed, as the nuns had taught her.</t3919><t3920>In the morning, she took care of her clothes, embroidering in the corridor or sewing on Amaranta's old hand-crank machine.</t3920><t3921>While the others took a siesta, she practiced the clavichord for two hours, knowing that the daily sacrifice would keep Fernanda calm.</t3921><t3922>For the same reason, she continued to give concerts at church bazaars and school soirées, although the requests were becoming less frequent.</t3922><t3923>In the evening, she would get ready, put on her simple dresses and stiff boots, and if she had nothing to do with her father, she would go to friends' houses, where she stayed until dinner time.</t3923><t3924>It was exceptional for Aureliano Segundo not to go and fetch her then to take her to the movies.</t3924>
<t3925>Among Meme's friends, there were three young American women who broke through the electrified chicken coop fence and established friendships with the girls of Macondo.</t3925> <t3926>One of them was Patricia Brown.</t3926> <t3927>Grateful for Aureliano Segundo's hospitality, Mr. Brown opened the doors of his house to Meme and invited her to the Saturday dances, which were the only occasions when the gringos mingled with the natives.</t3927> <t3928>When Fernanda found out, she momentarily forgot about Amaranta Úrsula and the invisible doctors, and created a whole melodrama.</t3928> <t3929>“Imagine —she said to Meme— what the colonel will think in his grave.”</t3929> <t3930>She was, of course, seeking Úrsula's support.</t3930> <t3931>But the blind old woman, contrary to everyone's expectations, considered that there was nothing wrong with Meme attending the dances and cultivating friendships with the American girls of her age, as long as she maintained her firmness of judgment and did not let herself be converted to the Protestant religion.</t3931> <t3932>Meme understood her great-great-grandmother's thoughts very well, and the day after the dances, she would get up earlier than usual to go to mass.</t3932> <t3933>Fernanda's opposition lasted until the day Meme disarmed her with the news that the Americans wanted to hear her play the clavichord.</t3933> <t3934>The instrument was once again taken out of the house and brought to Mr. Brown's, where the young concert performer indeed received the most sincere applause and the most enthusiastic congratulations.</t3934> <t3935>From then on, she was not only invited to the dances but also to the Sunday baths in the pool and to lunch once a week.</t3935> <t3936>Meme learned to swim like a professional, to play tennis, and to eat Virginia ham with pineapple slices.</t3936> <t3937>Between dances, pool, and tennis, she suddenly found herself untangling English.</t3937> <t3938>Aureliano Segundo was so enthusiastic about his daughter's progress that he bought from a traveling salesman an English encyclopedia in six volumes with numerous color plates, which Meme read in her free time.</t3938> <t3939>Reading occupied the attention she previously devoted to lovers' gossip or experimental seclusions with her friends, not because she had imposed it as a discipline, but because she had already lost all interest in discussing mysteries that were public knowledge.</t3939> <t3940>She remembered the drunkenness as a childish adventure and found it so amusing that she told Aureliano Segundo, who found it even more amusing than she did.</t3940> <t3941>“If your mother knew,” he said, choking with laughter, as he always did when she confided in him.</t3941> <t3942>He had made her promise that she would inform him with the same confidence about her first romance, and Meme had told him that she liked a red-haired American who had come to spend the holidays with his parents.</t3942> <t3943>“How outrageous,” laughed Aureliano Segundo.</t3943> <t3944>“If your mother knew.”</t3944> <t3945>But Meme also told him that the boy had returned to his country and had not shown any signs of life since.</t3945> <t3946>Her maturity of judgment strengthened domestic peace.</t3946> <t3947>Aureliano Segundo then spent more hours with Petra Cotes, and although his body and soul no longer allowed him to party as before, he never missed an opportunity to promote them and to pull out the accordion, which already had some keys tied with shoelaces.</t3947> <t3948>At home, Amaranta was embroidering her endless shroud, and Úrsula was being dragged by decrepitude into the depths of darkness, where the only visible thing was the specter of José Arcadio Buendía under the chestnut tree.</t3948> <t3949>Fernanda consolidated her authority.</t3949> <t3950>The monthly letters to her son José Arcadio then did not contain a single line of falsehood, and she only hid her correspondence with the invisible doctors, who had diagnosed a benign tumor in her large intestine and were preparing her for a telepathic intervention.</t3950>
<t3951>It might have been said that in the weary mansion of the Buendías there was peace and routine happiness for a long time if Amaranta's untimely death had not caused a new scandal.</t3951> <t3952>It was an unexpected event.</t3952> <t3953>Although she was old and isolated from everyone, she still appeared firm and upright, with the stone-like health she had always had.</t3953> <t3954>Nobody knew her thoughts since the afternoon she definitively rejected Colonel Gerineldo Márquez and locked herself in to cry.</t3954> <t3955>When she came out, she had exhausted all her tears.</t3955> <t3956>She was not seen crying at the ascension of Remedios the Beauty, nor at the extermination of the Aurelianos, nor at the death of Colonel Aureliano Buendía, who was the person she loved most in this world, although she could only show it when they found his body under the chestnut tree.</t3956> <t3957>She helped lift the body.</t3957> <t3958>She dressed him in his warrior gear, shaved him, combed him, and glued his mustache better than he had ever done in his years of glory.</t3958> <t3959>Nobody thought there was love in that act, because they were used to Amaranta's familiarity with the rites of death.</t3959> <t3960>Fernanda was scandalized that she did not understand the relations of Catholicism with life, but only its relations with death, as if it were not a religion, but a prospectus of funeral conventions.</t3960> <t3961>Amaranta was too entangled in the thicket of her memories to understand those apologetic subtleties.</t3961> <t3962>She had reached old age with all her nostalgias alive.</t3962> <t3963>When she listened to Pietro Crespi's waltzes, she felt the same desire to cry that she had in her adolescence, as if time and lessons had served no purpose.</t3963> <t3964>The music rolls she herself had thrown away, under the pretext that they were rotting with humidity, kept spinning and striking hammers in her memory.</t3964> <t3965>She had tried to sink them in the swampy passion she allowed herself with her nephew Aureliano José, and had tried to take refuge in the serene and virile protection of Colonel Gerineldo Márquez, but she had not managed to defeat them even with the most desperate act of her old age, when she bathed little José Arcadio three years before he was sent to the seminary, and caressed him not as a grandmother would with a grandson, but as a woman would with a man, as it was said French matrons did, and as she had wanted to do with Pietro Crespi, at twelve, fourteen years old, when she saw him with his dancing pants and the magic wand with which he kept the metronome's beat.</t3965> <t3966>Sometimes it hurt her to have left that trail of misery in her wake, and sometimes she was so angry that she pricked her fingers with the needles, but it hurt her more and made her angrier and more bitter the fragrant and worm-eaten guava grove of love she was dragging towards death.</t3966> <t3967>Just as Colonel Aureliano Buendía thought about the war, unable to avoid it, Amaranta thought about Rebeca.</t3967> <t3968>But while her brother had managed to sterilize the memories, she had only managed to scald them.</t3968> <t3969>The only thing she prayed to God for many years was that He would not punish her by making her die before Rebeca.</t3969> <t3970>Every time she passed by her house and noticed the progress of the destruction, she was pleased with the idea that God was listening to her.</t3970> <t3971>One afternoon, while sewing in the corridor, she was struck by the certainty that she would be sitting in that place, in that same position and under that same light, when they brought her the news of Rebeca's death.</t3971> <t3972>She sat down to wait for it, as one waits for a letter, and it was true that at one time she would rip off buttons to sew them back on, so that idleness would not make the wait longer and more distressing.</t3972> <t3973>Nobody in the house noticed that Amaranta then wove a beautiful shroud for Rebeca.</t3973> <t3974>Later, when Aureliano Triste said he had seen her turned into an apparition, with cracked skin and a few yellowish strands on her skull, Amaranta was not surprised, because the specter described was exactly as she had imagined it for a long time.</t3974> <t3975>She had decided to restore Rebeca's corpse, to disguise the ravages of her face with paraffin and make her a wig with the hair of saints.</t3975> <t3976>She would make a beautiful corpse, with the linen shroud and a plush-lined coffin with purple trimmings, and she would put it at the disposal of the worms in a splendid funeral.</t3976> <t3977>She elaborated the plan with so much hatred that the idea of having done it the same way if it had been out of love made her shudder, but she did not let herself be dazed by the confusion, and continued perfecting the details so meticulously that she became, more than a specialist, a virtuoso in the rites of death.</t3977> <t3978>The only thing she did not take into account in her tremendous plan was that, despite her pleas to God, she might die before Rebeca.</t3978> <t3979>And so it happened, indeed.</t3979> <t3980>But in the final moment, Amaranta did not feel frustrated, but on the contrary, liberated from all bitterness, because death granted her the privilege of announcing itself several years in advance.</t3980> <t3981>She saw it one scorching midday, sewing with her in the corridor, shortly after Meme had gone to school.</t3981> <t3982>She recognized it immediately, and there was nothing terrifying about death, because it was a woman dressed in blue with long hair, somewhat old-fashioned in appearance, and with a certain resemblance to Pilar Ternera in the time when she helped them with kitchen chores.</t3982> <t3983>Several times Fernanda was present and did not see her, even though she was so real, so human, that on one occasion she asked Amaranta to thread a needle for her.</t3983> <t3984>Death did not tell her when she was going to die or if her time was set before Rebeca's, but ordered her to start weaving her own shroud on the next sixth of April.</t3984> <t3985>It authorized her to make it as complicated and exquisite as she wanted, but as honestly as she had made Rebeca's, and warned her that she would die without pain, fear, or bitterness, at dusk on the day she finished it.</t3985> <t3986>Trying to waste as much time as possible, Amaranta ordered the bayal linen threads and made the fabric herself.</t3986> <t3987>She did it so carefully that just that task took her four years.</t3987> <t3988>Then she began the embroidery.</t3988> <t3989>As the inevitable end approached, she understood that only a miracle would allow her to prolong the work beyond Rebeca's death, but the same concentration provided her with the calm she needed to accept the idea of frustration.</t3989> <t3990>It was then that she understood the vicious circle of Colonel Aureliano Buendía's goldfish.</t3990> <t3991>The world was reduced to the surface of her skin, and the interior was safe from all bitterness.</t3991> <t3992>It pained her not to have had that revelation many years earlier, when it was still possible to purify memories and rebuild the universe under a new light, and to evoke without shuddering the lavender scent of Pietro Crespi at dusk, and to rescue Rebeca from her mire of misery, not out of hatred or love, but out of boundless understanding of solitude.</t3992> <t3993>The hatred she noticed one night in Meme's words did not move her because it affected her, but because she felt herself repeated in another adolescence that seemed as clean as hers must have seemed and yet was already tainted by resentment.</t3993> <t3994>But then her acceptance of her destiny was so deep that not even the certainty that all possibilities of rectification were closed unsettled her.</t3994> <t3995>Her only goal was to finish the shroud.</t3995> <t3996>Instead of delaying it with useless embellishments, as she had done at the beginning, she sped up the work.</t3996> <t3997>A week before, she calculated that she would give the last stitch on the night of February fourth, and without revealing the reason, she suggested to Meme that she move up a clavichord concert she had planned for the next day, but she did not listen.</t3997> <t3998>Amaranta then sought a way to delay herself forty-eight hours, and even thought that death was pleasing her, because on the night of February fourth a storm disrupted the power plant.</t3998> <t3999>But the next day, at eight in the morning, she gave the last stitch in the most exquisite work any woman had ever finished, and announced without the slightest drama that she would die at dusk.</t3999> <t4000>She not only warned the family but the entire town, because Amaranta had come to the idea that a life of meanness could be repaired with one last favor to the world, and thought that none was better than taking letters to the dead.</t4000>
<t4001>The news that Amaranta Buendía was setting sail at dusk carrying the mail of death spread in Macondo before noon, and by three in the afternoon there was a box full of letters in the living room.</t4001><t4002>Those who did not want to write gave Amaranta verbal messages that she noted in a notebook with the name and date of death of the recipient.</t4002><t4003>"Don't worry," she reassured the senders.</t4003><t4004>"The first thing I'll do when I get there is ask for him, and I'll give him your message."</t4004><t4005>It seemed like a farce.</t4005><t4006>Amaranta did not reveal any disturbance, not the slightest sign of pain, and she even looked a bit rejuvenated by the duty fulfilled.</t4006><t4007>She was as upright and slender as always.</t4007><t4008>If it hadn't been for the hardened cheekbones and the lack of some teeth, she would have seemed much less old than she actually was.</t4008><t4009>She herself arranged for the letters to be put in a tarred box, and indicated how it should be placed in the tomb to better preserve it from moisture.</t4009><t4010>In the morning she had called a carpenter who took her measurements for the coffin, standing in the living room, as if they were for a dress.</t4010><t4011>Such dynamism awoke in her in the last hours that Fernanda believed she was mocking everyone.</t4011><t4012>Úrsula, with the experience that the Buendías died without illness, did not doubt that Amaranta had had the premonition of death, but in any case, she was tormented by the fear that in the rush of the letters and the anxiety for them to arrive soon, the confused senders might bury her alive.</t4012><t4013>So she insisted on clearing the house, arguing loudly with the intruders, and by four in the afternoon she had succeeded.</t4013><t4014>At that hour, Amaranta had just distributed her belongings among the poor, and had only left on the severe unpolished wooden coffin the change of clothes and the simple velvet slippers she was to wear in death.</t4014><t4015>She did not overlook this precaution, remembering that when Colonel Aureliano Buendía died, they had to buy him a new pair of shoes because he only had the slippers he used in the workshop.</t4015><t4016>Shortly before five, Aureliano Segundo went to fetch Meme for the concert, and was surprised that the house was prepared for the funeral.</t4016><t4017>If anyone seemed alive at that hour, it was the serene Amaranta, who had even found time to cut her calluses.</t4017><t4018>Aureliano Segundo and Meme said goodbye to her with mocking farewells, and promised her that the following Saturday they would have the resurrection party.</t4018><t4019>Attracted by the public voices that Amaranta Buendía was receiving letters for the dead, Father Antonio Isabel arrived at five with the viaticum, and had to wait more than fifteen minutes for the dying woman to come out of the bathroom.</t4019><t4020>When he saw her appear in a madapolán nightgown with her hair loose down her back, the decrepit priest thought it was a joke and dismissed the altar boy.</t4020><t4021>He thought, however, to take advantage of the occasion to confess Amaranta after almost twenty years of reticence.</t4021><t4022>Amaranta simply replied that she did not need any kind of spiritual assistance because she had a clear conscience.</t4022><t4023>Fernanda was scandalized.</t4023><t4024>Without caring that she might be overheard, she wondered aloud what dreadful sin Amaranta had committed that she preferred a sacrilegious death to the shame of a confession.</t4024><t4025>Then Amaranta lay down and forced Úrsula to publicly testify to her virginity.</t4025>
<t4026>—Let no one have any illusions —she shouted, so that Fernanda could hear her—.</t4026> <t4027>Amaranta Buendía is leaving this world as she came.</t4027>
<t4028>She did not get up again.</t4028> <t4029>Reclining on cushions, as if she were truly ill, she braided her long hair and coiled it over her ears, just as death had told her she should be in the coffin.</t4029> <t4030>Then she asked Úrsula for a mirror, and for the first time in more than forty years, she saw her face ravaged by age and suffering, and she was surprised at how much it resembled the mental image she had of herself.</t4030> <t4031>Úrsula understood by the silence in the room that it had begun to darken.</t4031>
<t4032>—Say goodbye to Fernanda —he pleaded—.</t4032> <t4033>A minute of reconciliation has more merit than a lifetime of friendship.</t4033>
<t4034>—It's no longer worth it —replied Amaranta.</t4034>
<t4035>Meme couldn't help but think of her when they turned on the lights of the makeshift stage and the second part of the program began.</t4035> <t4036>Halfway through the piece, someone whispered the news in her ear, and the act was suspended.</t4036> <t4037>When he arrived at the house, Aureliano Segundo had to push his way through the crowd to see the corpse of the old maiden, ugly and discolored, with the black bandage in her hand and wrapped in the exquisite shroud.</t4037> <t4038>It was displayed in the living room next to the mail chest.</t4038>
<t4039>Úrsula did not get up again after Amaranta's nine nights.</t4039> <t4040>Santa Sofía de la Piedad took care of her.</t4040> <t4041>She brought her food to the bedroom, and bija water for her to wash, and kept her informed of everything that happened in Macondo.</t4041> <t4042>Aureliano Segundo visited her frequently, and brought clothes that she placed near the bed, along with the most essential things for daily living, so that in a short time she had built a world within arm's reach.</t4042> <t4043>She managed to awaken a great affection in little Amaranta Úrsula, who was identical to her, and whom she taught to read.</t4043> <t4044>Her lucidity, the ability to fend for herself, made it seem that she was naturally overcome by the weight of a hundred years, but although it was evident that her eyesight was failing, no one suspected that she was completely blind.</t4044> <t4045>She then had so much time and so much inner silence to watch over the life of the house, that she was the first to notice Meme's quiet tribulation.</t4045>
<t4046>—Come here —he said to her—.</t4046> <t4047>Now that we are alone, confess to this poor old woman what is happening to you.</t4047>
<t4048>Meme avoided the conversation with a nervous laugh.</t4048> <t4049>Úrsula did not insist, but she confirmed her suspicions when Meme did not visit her again.</t4049> <t4050>She knew that Meme got ready earlier than usual, that she did not have a moment of peace while waiting to go out, that she spent entire nights tossing and turning in the adjacent bedroom, and that she was tormented by the fluttering of a butterfly.</t4050> <t4051>On one occasion, she heard her say that she was going to meet Aureliano Segundo, and Úrsula was surprised that Fernanda was so unimaginative that she did not suspect anything when her husband came to the house to ask about their daughter.</t4051> <t4052>It was too obvious that Meme was involved in secret matters, urgent commitments, and repressed anxieties, long before the night when Fernanda caused a commotion in the house because she found her kissing a man at the cinema.</t4052>
<t4053>Meme herself was so self-absorbed at the time that she accused Úrsula of having denounced her.</t4053> <t4054>In reality, she denounced herself.</t4054> <t4055>For a long time, she had been leaving a trail of clues that would have awakened even the most oblivious, and if Fernanda took so long to discover them, it was because she too was dazzled by her secret relationships with the invisible doctors.</t4055> <t4056>Even so, she eventually noticed the deep silences, the sudden startles, the mood swings, and the contradictions of her daughter.</t4056> <t4057>She committed herself to a discreet but relentless surveillance.</t4057> <t4058>She let her go out with her usual friends, helped her dress for the Saturday parties, and never asked her an impertinent question that might alert her.</t4058> <t4059>She already had many proofs that Meme did different things from what she announced, and still did not reveal her suspicions, waiting for the decisive moment.</t4059> <t4060>One night, Meme told her that she was going to the cinema with her father.</t4060> <t4061>Shortly after, Fernanda heard the fireworks of the party and the unmistakable accordion of Aureliano Segundo in the direction of Petra Cotes.</t4061> <t4062>Then she got dressed, went to the cinema, and in the dim light of the seats, she recognized her daughter.</t4062> <t4063>The overwhelming emotion of being right prevented her from seeing the man she was kissing, but she managed to perceive his trembling voice amidst the catcalls and deafening laughter of the audience.</t4063> <t4064>“I'm sorry, love,” she heard him say, and she took Meme out of the hall without saying a word, subjected her to the shame of walking her through the bustling Calle de los Turcos, and locked her in the bedroom.</t4064>
<t4065>The next day, at six in the evening, Fernanda recognized the voice of the man who came to visit her.</t4065> <t4066>He was young, sallow, with dark and melancholic eyes that would not have surprised her so much if she had known the gypsies, and a dreamy air that any woman with a less rigid heart would have understood the reasons for her daughter.</t4066> <t4067>He was dressed in very worn linen, with shoes desperately defended with superimposed zinc white patches, and he carried in his hand a boater hat bought the previous Saturday.</t4067> <t4068>In his life, he had never been nor would he ever be more frightened than at that moment, but he had a dignity and composure that kept him safe from humiliation, and a legitimate presence that only failed in his chapped hands and nails splintered by rough work.</t4068> <t4069>Fernanda, however, only needed to see him once to sense his working-class condition.</t4069> <t4070>She realized he was wearing his only Sunday outfit, and that beneath his shirt, his skin was corroded by the scabies from the banana company.</t4070> <t4071>She did not allow him to speak.</t4071> <t4072>She did not even allow him to pass through the door, which she had to close a moment later because the house was filled with yellow butterflies.</t4072>
<t4073>—Get out —he said to him—.</t4073> <t4074>You have no business coming here among decent people.</t4074>
<t4075>His name was Mauricio Babilonia.</t4075> <t4076>He was born and raised in Macondo, and he was an apprentice mechanic in the banana company's workshops.</t4076> <t4077>Meme had met him by chance, one afternoon when she went with Patricia Brown to fetch the car for a drive through the plantations.</t4077> <t4078>Since the driver was sick, they entrusted him with driving them, and Meme was finally able to satisfy her desire to sit next to the steering wheel to closely observe the driving system.</t4078> <t4079>Unlike the regular driver, Mauricio Babilonia gave her a practical demonstration.</t4079> <t4080>That was around the time when Meme started to frequent Mr. Brown's house, and it was still considered unladylike to drive a car.</t4080> <t4081>So she settled for theoretical information and did not see Mauricio Babilonia again for several months.</t4081> <t4082>Later she would remember that during the drive, his masculine beauty caught her attention, except for the roughness of his hands, but she had commented to Patricia Brown afterward about the annoyance his somewhat arrogant confidence caused her.</t4082> <t4083>The first Saturday she went to the movies with her father, she saw Mauricio Babilonia again in his linen suit, sitting a short distance from them, and noticed that he was uninterested in the movie, turning to look at her, not so much to see her but to make sure she noticed he was looking at her.</t4083> <t4084>Meme was bothered by the vulgarity of that tactic.</t4084> <t4085>At the end, Mauricio Babilonia approached to greet Aureliano Segundo, and only then did Meme find out that they knew each other because he had worked in Aureliano Triste's primitive power plant and treated her father with a subordinate's attitude.</t4085> <t4086>That realization relieved her of the annoyance his arrogance caused her.</t4086> <t4087>They had not seen each other alone, nor exchanged a word beyond a greeting, the night she dreamed that he saved her from a shipwreck and she felt not gratitude but anger.</t4087> <t4088>It was like giving him an opportunity he desired, while Meme longed for the opposite, not only with Mauricio Babilonia but with any other man who showed interest in her.</t4088> <t4089>That is why she was so outraged that after the dream, instead of detesting him, she felt an irresistible urge to see him.</t4089> <t4090>The anxiety grew more intense over the week, and by Saturday it was so pressing that she had to make a great effort to ensure Mauricio Babilonia did not notice, when greeting her at the cinema, that her heart was about to leap out of her mouth.</t4090> <t4091>Confused by a mixed sensation of pleasure and anger, she extended her hand for the first time, and only then did Mauricio Babilonia allow himself to shake it.</t4091> <t4092>In a fraction of a second, Meme regretted her impulse, but the regret immediately turned into a cruel satisfaction when she realized that his hand was also sweaty and cold.</t4092> <t4093>That night she understood that she would not have a moment of peace until she demonstrated to Mauricio Babilonia the futility of his aspiration, and she spent the week fluttering around that anxiety.</t4093> <t4094>She resorted to all sorts of useless tricks to get Patricia Brown to take her to fetch the car.</t4094> <t4095>Finally, she took advantage of the red-haired American who was vacationing in Macondo at the time, and under the pretext of wanting to see the new car models, she got him to take her to the workshops.</t4095> <t4096>From the moment she saw him, Meme stopped deceiving herself and understood that what was really happening was that she could not bear the desire to be alone with Mauricio Babilonia, and she was outraged by the certainty that he had understood this upon seeing her arrive.</t4096>
<t4097>—I came to see the new models —said Meme.</t4097>
<t4098>—It's a good excuse —he said.</t4098>
<t4099>Meme realized that she was burning in the fire of her pride, and desperately sought a way to humiliate him.</t4099> <t4100>But he didn't give her time. "Don't be scared," he said in a low voice.</t4100> <t4101>"It's not the first time a woman has gone crazy over a man."</t4101> <t4102>She felt so helpless that she left the workshop without seeing the new models, and spent the night tossing and turning in bed and crying in indignation.</t4102> <t4103>The red-haired American, who was actually starting to interest her, seemed like a baby to her.</t4103> <t4104>It was then that she realized the yellow butterflies preceded the appearances of Mauricio Babilonia.</t4104> <t4105>She had seen them before, especially in the mechanic's workshop, and had thought they were fascinated by the smell of the paint.</t4105> <t4106>Sometimes she had felt them fluttering over her head in the dim light of the cinema.</t4106> <t4107>But when Mauricio Babilonia started to pursue her, like a specter that only she could identify in the crowd, she understood that the yellow butterflies had something to do with him.</t4107> <t4108>Mauricio Babilonia was always in the audience at concerts, in the cinema, at high mass, and she didn't need to see him to discover him, because the butterflies indicated his presence.</t4108> <t4109>Once, Aureliano Segundo became so impatient with the suffocating fluttering that she felt the urge to confide her secret to him, as she had promised, but instinct told her that this time he wouldn't laugh as usual: "What would your mother say if she knew."</t4109> <t4110>One morning, while they were pruning the roses, Fernanda let out a scream of fright and made Meme move from the spot where she was standing, which was the same spot in the garden where Remedios the Beauty had ascended to the heavens.</t4110> <t4111>For a moment, she had the impression that the miracle was going to repeat itself in her daughter, because she was disturbed by a sudden fluttering.</t4111> <t4112>It was the butterflies.</t4112> <t4113>Meme saw them, as if they had suddenly been born in the light, and her heart skipped a beat.</t4113> <t4114>At that moment, Mauricio Babilonia entered with a package that, according to him, was a gift from Patricia Brown.</t4114> <t4115>Meme swallowed her blush, assimilated the tribulation, and even managed a natural smile to ask him to put it on the handrail because her fingers were dirty with soil.</t4115> <t4116>The only thing Fernanda noticed about the man who a few months later she would expel from the house without remembering ever having seen him was the bilious texture of his skin.</t4116>
<t4117>—He is a very strange man —said Fernanda—.</t4117> <t4118>You can see it in his face that he is going to die.</t4118>
<t4119>Meme thought that her mother had been impressed by the butterflies.</t4119> <t4120>When they finished pruning the rosebush, she washed her hands and took the package to the bedroom to open it.</t4120> <t4121>It was a kind of Chinese toy, composed of five concentric boxes, and in the last one, a card laboriously drawn by someone who could barely write:</t4121> <t4122>See you on Saturday at the cinema.</t4122> <t4123>Meme felt the belated astonishment that the box had been on the banister for so long within Fernanda's reach, and although she was flattered by Mauricio Babilonia's audacity and ingenuity, she was moved by his naivety in expecting her to keep the date.</t4123> <t4124>Meme knew since then that Aureliano Segundo had a commitment on Saturday night.</t4124> <t4125>However, the fire of anxiety burned her so much during the week that on Saturday she convinced her father to leave her alone at the theater and come back for her when the show was over.</t4125> <t4126>A moth fluttered over her head while the lights were on.</t4126> <t4127>And then it happened.</t4127> <t4128>When the lights went out, Mauricio Babilonia sat next to her.</t4128> <t4129>Meme felt as if she were floundering in a quagmire of anxiety, from which only that man smelling of motor oil, whom she could barely distinguish in the dim light, could rescue her, as had happened in the dream.</t4129>
<t4130>—If you hadn't come —he said—, you would never have seen me again.</t4130>
<t4131>Meme felt the weight of his hand on her knee, and she knew that both of them, at that moment, had reached the other side of desolation.</t4131>
<t4132>—What shocks me about you —he smiled— is that you always say precisely what shouldn't be said.</t4132>
<t4133>She went crazy for him.</t4133><t4134>She lost sleep and appetite, and sank so deeply into loneliness that even her father became a hindrance to her.</t4134><t4135>She devised an intricate web of false commitments to mislead Fernanda, lost sight of her friends, and jumped over conventions to meet Mauricio Babilonia at any time and in any place.</t4135><t4136>At first, his roughness bothered her.</t4136><t4137>The first time they were alone, in the deserted meadows behind the mechanic's workshop, he dragged her mercilessly into an animal state that left her exhausted.</t4137><t4138>It took her some time to realize that this too was a form of tenderness, and it was then that she lost her peace of mind, living only for him, disturbed by the anxiety of sinking into his stifling breath of oil mixed with lye.</t4138><t4139>Shortly before Amaranta's death, she suddenly stumbled upon a moment of lucidity within her madness, and trembled at the uncertainty of the future.</t4139><t4140>Then she heard about a woman who made predictions with cards, and went to visit her in secret.</t4140><t4141>It was Pilar Ternera.</t4141><t4142>From the moment she saw her enter, she knew Meme's hidden motives.</t4142><t4143>"Sit down," she said.</t4143><t4144>"I don't need cards to find out the future of a Buendía."</t4144><t4145>Meme did not know, and never knew, that this centenarian fortune-teller was her great-grandmother.</t4145><t4146>Nor would she have believed it after the aggressive realism with which she revealed that the anxiety of love found no rest except in bed.</t4146><t4147>It was the same point of view as Mauricio Babilonia, but Meme resisted giving it credit, for deep down she assumed it was inspired by a poor craftsman's judgment.</t4147><t4148>She thought then that one kind of love defeated another kind of love, because it was in the nature of men to repudiate hunger once appetite was satisfied.</t4148><t4149>Pilar Ternera not only dispelled the error but also offered her the old canvas bed where she had conceived Arcadio, Meme's grandfather, and later conceived Aureliano José.</t4149><t4150>She also taught her how to prevent unwanted conception by steaming mustard poultices, and gave her recipes for potions that in case of mishaps would expel "even the pangs of conscience."</t4150><t4151>That interview instilled in Meme the same feeling of bravery she had experienced on the afternoon of her drunkenness.</t4151><t4152>Amaranta's death, however, forced her to postpone her decision.</t4152><t4153>During the nine nights of mourning, she did not leave Mauricio Babilonia's side for a moment, who was mingling with the crowd that had invaded the house.</t4153><t4154>Then came the prolonged mourning and the obligatory confinement, and they were separated for a time.</t4154><t4155>Those were days of such inner turmoil, such irrepressible anxiety, and so many repressed longings that the first afternoon Meme managed to go out, she went straight to Pilar Ternera's house.</t4155><t4156>She surrendered to Mauricio Babilonia without resistance, without shame, without formalities, and with such fluid vocation and wise intuition that a more suspicious man than hers might have mistaken them for refined experience.</t4156><t4157>They made love twice a week for more than three months, protected by the innocent complicity of Aureliano Segundo, who unwittingly vouched for his daughter's alibis, just to see her freed from her mother's rigidity.</t4157>
<t4158>The night Fernanda caught them at the cinema, Aureliano Segundo felt overwhelmed by the weight of his conscience, and visited Meme in the bedroom where Fernanda had locked her up, hoping that she would confide in him the secrets she owed him.</t4158> <t4159>But Meme denied everything.</t4159> <t4160>She was so sure of herself, so clinging to her solitude, that Aureliano Segundo had the impression that there was no longer any bond between them, that the camaraderie and complicity were nothing more than an illusion of the past.</t4160> <t4161>He thought about talking to Mauricio Babilonia, believing that his authority as a former boss would make him give up his intentions, but Petra Cotes convinced him that those were women's matters, so he remained floating in a limbo of indecision, barely sustained by the hope that the confinement would end his daughter's tribulations.</t4161>
<t4162>Meme showed no sign of affliction.</t4162> <t4163>On the contrary, from the adjoining bedroom, Úrsula perceived the calm rhythm of her sleep, the serenity of her tasks, the order of her meals, and the good health of her digestion.</t4163> <t4164>The only thing that intrigued Úrsula after almost two months of punishment was that Meme did not bathe in the morning, as everyone else did, but at seven in the evening.</t4164> <t4165>Once she thought of warning her about the scorpions, but Meme was so elusive with her, convinced that she had denounced her, that she preferred not to disturb her with great-grandmotherly impertinences.</t4165> <t4166>The yellow butterflies invaded the house from dusk.</t4166> <t4167>Every night, upon returning from the bath, Meme found Fernanda desperate, killing butterflies with the insecticide spray.</t4167> <t4168>“This is a disgrace,” she said.</t4168> <t4169>“All my life I've been told that nocturnal butterflies bring bad luck.”</t4169> <t4170>One night, while Meme was in the bath, Fernanda entered her bedroom by chance, and there were so many butterflies that it was almost impossible to breathe.</t4170> <t4171>She grabbed any cloth to scare them away, and her heart froze with fear as she connected her daughter's nightly baths with the mustard poultices that rolled on the floor.</t4171> <t4172>She did not wait for an opportune moment, as she had the first time.</t4172> <t4173>The next day, she invited the new mayor, who like her had come down from the highlands, to lunch and asked him to establish a night watch in the backyard because she had the impression that the chickens were being stolen.</t4173> <t4174>That night, the guard shot down Mauricio Babilonia as he was lifting the tiles to enter the bathroom where Meme awaited him, naked and trembling with love among the scorpions and butterflies, as she had done almost every night for the past few months.</t4174> <t4175>A projectile embedded in his spine confined him to bed for the rest of his life.</t4175> <t4176>He died of old age in solitude, without a complaint, without a protest, without a single attempt at infidelity, tormented by memories and by the yellow butterflies that did not grant him a moment of peace, and publicly repudiated as a chicken thief.</t4176>
<t4177>The events that were to deal the mortal blow to Macondo began to come into view when they brought Meme Buendía's son to the house.</t4177> <t4178>The public situation was so uncertain at the time that no one had the spirit to deal with private scandals, so Fernanda had a favorable environment to keep the child hidden as if he had never existed.</t4178> <t4179>She had to take him in because the circumstances in which he was brought made rejection impossible.</t4179> <t4180>She had to endure him against her will for the rest of her life because, when it came down to it, she lacked the courage to carry out her private determination to drown him in the bath pool.</t4180> <t4181>She locked him in Colonel Aureliano Buendía's old workshop.</t4181> <t4182>She managed to convince Santa Sofía de la Piedad that she had found him floating in a basket.</t4182> <t4183>Úrsula was to die without knowing his origin.</t4183> <t4184>Little Amaranta Úrsula, who once entered the workshop when Fernanda was feeding the child, also believed the story of the floating basket.</t4184> <t4185>Aureliano Segundo, definitively estranged from his wife due to the irrational way she handled Meme's tragedy, did not learn of his grandson's existence until three years after he was brought to the house, when the child escaped captivity due to Fernanda's carelessness and peeked into the hallway for a fraction of a second, naked and with tangled hair and an impressive turkey-cock sex, as if he were not a human child but the encyclopedic definition of an anthropophage.</t4185>
<t4186>Fernanda did not count on that prank from her incorrigible destiny.</t4186> <t4187>The child was like the return of a shame she thought she had banished from the house forever.</t4187> <t4188>They had barely taken Mauricio Babilonia away with a fractured spine, and Fernanda had already conceived down to the smallest detail a plan to eliminate every trace of the disgrace.</t4188> <t4189>Without consulting her husband, she packed her bags the next day, put the three changes of clothes her daughter might need into a small suitcase, and went to fetch her from the bedroom half an hour before the train's arrival.</t4189>
<t4190>—Let's go, Renata —he said to her.</t4190>
<t4191>He gave her no explanation.</t4191> <t4192>Meme, for her part, neither expected nor wanted one.</t4192> <t4193>Not only did she not know where they were going, but it would have made no difference to her if they had taken her to the slaughterhouse.</t4193> <t4194>She had not spoken again, nor would she for the rest of her life, since she heard the gunshot in the backyard and the simultaneous howl of pain from Mauricio Babilonia.</t4194> <t4195>When her mother ordered her to leave the bedroom, she neither combed her hair nor washed her face, and boarded the train like a sleepwalker, not even noticing the yellow butterflies that continued to accompany her.</t4195> <t4196>Fernanda never knew, nor did she take the trouble to find out, whether her stony silence was a determination of her will, or if she had been struck mute by the impact of the tragedy.</t4196> <t4197>Meme barely noticed the journey through the ancient enchanted region.</t4197> <t4198>She did not see the shady and endless banana plantations on either side of the tracks.</t4198> <t4199>She did not see the white houses of the gringos, nor their gardens parched by dust and heat, nor the women in shorts and blue striped shirts playing cards on the porches.</t4199> <t4200>She did not see the ox carts loaded with bunches on the dusty roads.</t4200> <t4201>She did not see the maidens who leapt like tarpons in the clear rivers to leave the train passengers with the bitterness of their splendid breasts, nor the colorful and miserable barracks of the workers where Mauricio Babilonia's yellow butterflies fluttered, and in whose doorways green and scrawny children sat on their potties, and pregnant women shouted curses as the train passed by.</t4201> <t4202>That fleeting vision, which for her was a celebration when she returned from school, passed through Meme's heart without awakening it.</t4202> <t4203>She did not look out the window even when the burning humidity of the plantations ended, and the train passed through the poppy plain where the charred ribs of the Spanish galleon still lay, and then emerged into the same clear air and the same foamy and dirty sea where almost a century earlier the dreams of José Arcadio Buendía had failed.</t4203>
<t4204>At five in the afternoon, when they arrived at the final station of the swamp, he got off the train because Fernanda did.</t4204><t4205>They got into a little carriage that looked like a huge bat, pulled by an asthmatic horse, and crossed the desolate city, in whose endless streets cracked by saltpeter, a piano exercise echoed just like the one Fernanda heard during the siestas of her adolescence.</t4205><t4206>They embarked on a riverboat, whose wooden wheel made a noise like a conflagration, and whose iron sheets corroded by rust reverberated like the mouth of a furnace.</t4206><t4207>Meme locked herself in the cabin.</t4207><t4208>Twice a day, Fernanda left a plate of food next to the bed, and twice a day she took it back untouched, not because Meme had decided to starve herself, but because the mere smell of the food repulsed her and her stomach expelled even water.</t4208><t4209>Not even she knew then that her fertility had defied the mustard vapors, just as Fernanda did not know until almost a year later when they brought the child to her.</t4209><t4210>In the stifling cabin, disturbed by the vibration of the iron walls and the unbearable stench of the silt stirred by the boat's wheel, Meme lost track of the days.</t4210><t4211>A long time had passed when she saw the last yellow butterfly being torn apart by the fan blades and admitted as an irremediable truth that Mauricio Babilonia was dead.</t4211><t4212>However, she did not let herself be overcome by resignation.</t4212><t4213>She kept thinking about him during the arduous mule-back journey through the hallucinatory wasteland where Aureliano Segundo got lost while searching for the most beautiful woman ever to walk the earth, and when they climbed the mountain range along Indian paths and entered the gloomy city where the funeral bells of thirty-two churches echoed through the stone labyrinths.</t4213><t4214>That night they slept in the abandoned colonial mansion, on the planks that Fernanda laid on the floor of a room overrun by weeds, covered with scraps of curtains they tore from the windows and that crumbled with every turn of the body.</t4214><t4215>Meme knew where they were because in the terror of insomnia she saw the gentleman dressed in black who, on a distant Christmas Eve, had been brought to the house inside a lead coffin.</t4215><t4216>The next day, after mass, Fernanda led her to a somber building that Meme immediately recognized from the recollections her mother used to make of the convent where she was educated to be a queen, and then she understood that she had reached the end of the journey.</t4216><t4217>While Fernanda spoke with someone in the adjoining office, she remained in a checkered hall with large oil paintings of colonial archbishops, trembling with cold, because she was still wearing a dress of etamine with little black flowers and the hard boots swollen from the ice of the wasteland.</t4217><t4218>She was standing in the center of the hall, thinking of Mauricio Babilonia under the yellow stream of the stained glass windows, when a very beautiful novice came out of the office carrying her little suitcase with the three changes of clothes.</t4218><t4219>As she passed by Meme, she extended her hand without stopping.</t4219>
<t4220>—Let's go, Renata —he said to her.</t4220>
<t4221>Meme took her hand and let herself be led.</t4221> <t4222>The last time Fernanda saw her, trying to match her pace with that of the novice, the iron gate of the cloister had just closed behind her.</t4222> <t4223>She was still thinking of Mauricio Babilonia, of his smell of oil and his realm of butterflies, and she would continue thinking of him every day of her life, until the distant autumn dawn when she would die of old age, with their names changed and never having spoken a word, in a gloomy hospital in Krakow.</t4223>
<t4224>Fernanda returned to Macondo on a train protected by armed police.</t4224> <t4225>During the journey, she noticed the tension of the passengers, the military preparations in the towns along the line, and the air thick with the certainty that something serious was going to happen, but she lacked information until she arrived in Macondo and was told that José Arcadio Segundo was inciting the banana company workers to strike.</t4225> <t4226>“This is the last thing we needed,” Fernanda said to herself.</t4226> <t4227>“An anarchist in the family.”</t4227> <t4228>The strike broke out two weeks later and did not have the dramatic consequences that were feared.</t4228> <t4229>The workers hoped that they would not be forced to cut and ship bananas on Sundays, and the request seemed so fair that even Father Antonio Isabel interceded in favor of it because he found it in accordance with the law of God.</t4229> <t4230>The success of the action, as well as others that were promoted in the following months, brought the colorless José Arcadio Segundo out of anonymity, of whom it was often said that he had only served to fill the town with French prostitutes.</t4230> <t4231>With the same impulsive decision with which he sold off his fighting cocks to establish a misguided navigation company, he had resigned from his position as foreman of the banana company crew and took the side of the workers.</t4231> <t4232>Very soon, he was identified as an agent of an international conspiracy against public order.</t4232> <t4233>One night, during a week darkened by ominous rumors, he miraculously escaped four revolver shots fired by an unknown assailant as he was leaving a secret meeting.</t4233> <t4234>The atmosphere of the following months was so tense that even Úrsula perceived it in her corner of darkness, and she had the impression of living again the tumultuous times when her son Aureliano carried the homeopathic globules of subversion in his pocket.</t4234> <t4235>She tried to talk to José Arcadio Segundo to inform him of this precedent, but Aureliano Segundo told her that his whereabouts had been unknown since the night of the attack.</t4235>
<t4236>—Just like Aureliano —exclaimed Úrsula—.</t4236> <t4237>It's as if the world were spinning around.</t4237>
<t4238>Fernanda remained immune to the uncertainty of those days.</t4238> <t4239>She lacked contact with the outside world since the violent altercation she had with her husband for having determined Meme's fate without his consent.</t4239> <t4240>Aureliano Segundo was willing to rescue his daughter, with the police if necessary, but Fernanda showed him papers proving that she had entered the cloister of her own free will.</t4240> <t4241>Indeed, Meme had signed them when she was already on the other side of the iron gate, and she did so with the same disdain with which she allowed herself to be led.</t4241> <t4242>Deep down, Aureliano Segundo did not believe in the legitimacy of the evidence, just as he never believed that Mauricio Babilonia had entered the yard to steal chickens, but both cases served to ease his conscience, and he was then able to return without remorse to the shadow of Petra Cotes, where he resumed the noisy parties and outrageous feasts.</t4242> <t4243>Unconcerned by the town's unrest, deaf to Úrsula's dire predictions, Fernanda gave the final turn to the screws of her accomplished plan.</t4243> <t4244>She wrote a lengthy letter to her son José Arcadio, who was about to receive minor orders, informing him that his sister Renata had passed away in the peace of the Lord due to black vomit.</t4244> <t4245>Then she placed Amaranta Úrsula in the care of Santa Sofía de la Piedad and dedicated herself to organizing her correspondence with the invisible doctors, disturbed by Meme's mishap.</t4245> <t4246>The first thing she did was set a definitive date for the postponed telepathic intervention.</t4246> <t4247>But the invisible doctors replied that it was not prudent while the state of social agitation in Macondo persisted.</t4247> <t4248>She was so urgent and so poorly informed that she explained in another letter that there was no such state of agitation, and that it was all the result of the madness of a brother-in-law of hers, who was going through a phase of unionist fervor, just as he had previously gone through phases of cockfighting and navigation.</t4248> <t4249>They still had not agreed on the hot Wednesday when an elderly nun carrying a small basket on her arm knocked on the door of the house.</t4249> <t4250>Upon opening the door, Santa Sofía de la Piedad thought it was a gift and tried to take the basket covered with a delicate lace cloth.</t4250> <t4251>But the nun prevented her, as she had instructions to deliver it personally, and under the strictest confidence, to Doña Fernanda del Carpio de Buendía.</t4251> <t4252>It was Meme's child.</t4252> <t4253>Fernanda's former spiritual director explained in a letter that the child had been born two months earlier, and they had taken the liberty of baptizing him with the name Aureliano, like his grandfather, because the mother did not open her lips to express her will.</t4253> <t4254>Fernanda inwardly rebelled against that mockery of fate, but she had the strength to hide it in front of the nun.</t4254>
<t4255>—We'll say we found him floating in the basket —he smiled.</t4255>
<t4256>—No one will believe it —said the nun.</t4256>
<t4257>—If they believed the Holy Scriptures —replied Fernanda—, I don't see why they shouldn't believe me.</t4257>
<t4258>The nun had lunch at home while the returning train passed by, and in accordance with the discretion that had been demanded of her, she did not mention the child again. However, Fernanda saw her as an undesirable witness to her shame and regretted that the medieval custom of hanging the bearer of bad news had been discarded.</t4258> <t4259>It was then that she decided to drown the child in the pool as soon as the nun left, but her heart couldn't bear it, and she preferred to patiently wait for God's infinite kindness to free her from the burden.</t4259>
<t4260>The new Aureliano had turned one year old when the public tension erupted without any warning.</t4260> <t4261>José Arcadio Segundo and other union leaders who had remained in hiding until then appeared unexpectedly one weekend and promoted demonstrations in the towns of the banana zone.</t4261> <t4262>The police were content to monitor the order.</t4262> <t4263>But on Monday night, the leaders were taken from their homes and sent with five-kilo shackles on their feet to the provincial capital's jail.</t4263> <t4264>Among them were José Arcadio Segundo and Lorenzo Gavilán, a colonel of the Mexican revolution, exiled in Macondo, who claimed to have witnessed the heroism of his comrade Artemio Cruz.</t4264> <t4265>However, within three months they were free, because the government and the banana company could not agree on who should feed them in jail.</t4265> <t4266>The workers' discontent this time was based on the unsanitary housing, the deceit of medical services, and the inequity of working conditions.</t4266> <t4267>They also claimed that they were not paid in cash, but with vouchers that were only good for buying Virginia ham at the company's commissaries.</t4267> <t4268>José Arcadio Segundo was imprisoned because he revealed that the voucher system was a company scheme to finance their fruit ships, which would have had to return empty from New Orleans to the banana shipping ports if not for the commissary goods.</t4268> <t4269>The other charges were public knowledge.</t4269> <t4270>The company's doctors did not examine the sick, but made them stand in single file in front of the dispensaries, and a nurse would place a pill the color of piedralipe on their tongues, whether they had malaria, gonorrhea, or constipation.</t4270> <t4271>It was such a widespread therapy that children would get in line several times, and instead of swallowing the pills, they would take them home to mark the numbers called in the lottery game.</t4271> <t4272>The company workers were crammed into miserable shacks.</t4272> <t4273>The engineers, instead of building latrines, brought a portable toilet for every fifty people to the camps at Christmas and gave public demonstrations on how to use them to make them last longer.</t4273> <t4274>The decrepit lawyers dressed in black who once harassed Colonel Aureliano Buendía, and who were then agents of the banana company, discredited these charges with tricks that seemed like magic.</t4274> <t4275>When the workers drafted a unanimous list of demands, a long time passed without being able to officially notify the banana company.</t4275> <t4276>As soon as he learned of the agreement, Mr. Brown hooked his luxurious glass car to the train and disappeared from Macondo along with the most well-known representatives of his company.</t4276> <t4277>However, several workers found one of them the following Saturday in a brothel and made him sign a copy of the list of demands while he was naked with the woman who had lured him into the trap.</t4277> <t4278>The mournful lawyers proved in court that the man had nothing to do with the company, and to ensure no one doubted their arguments, they had him imprisoned for impersonation.</t4278> <t4279>Later, Mr. Brown was caught traveling incognito in a third-class car and was made to sign another copy of the list of demands.</t4279> <t4280>The next day, he appeared before the judges with his hair dyed black and speaking flawless Spanish.</t4280> <t4281>The lawyers proved that he was not Mr. Jack Brown, superintendent of the banana company and born in Prattville, Alabama, but an innocent medicinal plant seller, born in Macondo and baptized there with the name Dagoberto Fonseca.</t4281> <t4282>Shortly after, in response to a new attempt by the workers, the lawyers displayed in public places the death certificate of Mr. Brown, authenticated by consuls and chancellors, which certified that on the past June ninth, he had been run over by a fire truck in Chicago.</t4282> <t4283>Tired of that hermeneutic delirium, the workers repudiated the authorities of Macondo and took their complaints to the supreme courts.</t4283> <t4284>It was there that the legal illusionists demonstrated that the claims were entirely invalid, simply because the banana company did not have, had never had, and would never have workers in its service, but recruited them occasionally and temporarily.</t4284> <t4285>Thus, the charade of the Virginia ham, the miraculous pills, and the Easter toilets was dismantled, and it was established by court ruling and solemnly proclaimed that the workers did not exist.</t4285>
<t4286>The great strike broke out.</t4286> <t4287>The crops were left half-finished, the fruit overripe on the vines, and the trains with one hundred and twenty cars stopped on the branches.</t4287> <t4288>Idle workers overflowed the towns.</t4288> <t4289>The Street of the Turks reverberated in a Saturday of many days, and in the billiard room of Jacob's Hotel, twenty-four-hour shifts had to be established.</t4289> <t4290>There was José Arcadio Segundo, on the day it was announced that the army had been tasked with restoring public order.</t4290> <t4291>Although he was not a man of omens, the news was for him like an announcement of death, which he had awaited since the distant morning when Colonel Gerineldo Márquez allowed him to witness an execution.</t4291> <t4292>However, the bad omen did not alter his solemnity.</t4292> <t4293>He made the move he had planned and did not miss the carom.</t4293> <t4294>Shortly after, the drum rolls, the trumpet barks, the shouts, and the clamor of the people indicated to him that not only the billiard game but also the silent and solitary game he had been playing with himself since the dawn of the execution had finally ended.</t4294> <t4295>Then he looked out onto the street and saw them.</t4295> <t4296>They were three regiments whose march, paced by the drum of galley slaves, made the ground tremble.</t4296> <t4297>Their multi-headed dragon breath impregnated the midday clarity with a pestilent vapor.</t4297> <t4298>They were small, stocky, brutish.</t4298> <t4299>They sweated horse sweat, and had the smell of meat macerated by the sun, and the taciturn and impenetrable impassivity of men from the wasteland.</t4299> <t4300>Although they took more than an hour to pass, one might have thought they were a few squads turning in circles, because they were all identical, children of the same mother, and all bore with equal stolidity the weight of the knapsacks and canteens, and the shame of the rifles with bayonets fixed, and the nuisance of blind obedience and the sense of honor.</t4300> <t4301>Úrsula heard them pass from her bed of darkness and raised her hand with her fingers in a cross.</t4301> <t4302>Santa Sofía de la Piedad existed for an instant, bent over the embroidered tablecloth she had just ironed, and thought of her son, José Arcadio Segundo, who watched the last soldiers pass by the door of Jacob's Hotel without flinching.</t4302>
<t4303>Martial law empowered the army to assume the role of arbitrator in the controversy, but no attempt at conciliation was made.</t4303><t4304>As soon as they appeared in Macondo, the soldiers set aside their rifles, cut and loaded the bananas, and mobilized the trains.</t4304><t4305>The workers, who until then had been content to wait, took to the hills with no more weapons than their work machetes, and began to sabotage the sabotage.</t4305><t4306>They set fire to farms and commissaries, destroyed the rails to prevent the passage of trains that were starting to make their way with machine gun fire, and cut the telegraph and telephone wires.</t4306><t4307>The ditches were stained with blood.</t4307><t4308>Mr. Brown, who was alive in the electrified chicken coop, was taken out of Macondo with his family and those of other compatriots, and escorted to safe territory under the protection of the army.</t4308><t4309>The situation threatened to evolve into an unequal and bloody civil war when the authorities called on the workers to gather in Macondo.</t4309><t4310>The call announced that the Civil and Military Chief of the province would arrive the following Friday, ready to intercede in the conflict.</t4310>
<t4311>José Arcadio Segundo was among the crowd that gathered at the station since Friday morning.</t4311> <t4312>He had participated in a meeting of the union leaders and had been commissioned along with Colonel Gavilán to blend in with the crowd and guide it according to the circumstances.</t4312> <t4313>He didn't feel well, and he kneaded a salty paste in his palate, ever since he noticed that the army had set up machine gun nests around the square, and that the barbed-wired city of the banana company was protected with artillery pieces.</t4313> <t4314>By noon, waiting for a train that did not arrive, more than three thousand people, including workers, women, and children, had overflowed the open space in front of the station and were crowding the adjacent streets that the army had closed off with rows of machine guns.</t4314> <t4315>It seemed then, more than a reception, a joyous fair.</t4315> <t4316>They had moved the food stalls and drink shops from the Street of the Turks, and people endured the annoyance of waiting and the scorching sun with very good spirits.</t4316> <t4317>A little before three, a rumor spread that the official train would not arrive until the next day.</t4317> <t4318>The tired crowd exhaled a sigh of discouragement.</t4318> <t4319>An army lieutenant then climbed onto the roof of the station, where there were four machine gun nests aimed at the crowd, and called for silence.</t4319> <t4320>Next to José Arcadio Segundo was a very fat, barefoot woman with two children about four and seven years old.</t4320> <t4321>She picked up the younger one and asked José Arcadio Segundo, without knowing him, to lift the other so he could hear better what was going to be said.</t4321> <t4322>José Arcadio Segundo hoisted the child onto his shoulders.</t4322> <t4323>Many years later, that child would continue to tell, without anyone believing him, that he had seen the lieutenant reading with a gramophone horn the Decree Number 4 of the Civil and Military Chief of the province.</t4323> <t4324>It was signed by General Carlos Cortes Vargas, and by his secretary, Major Enrique García Isaza, and in three articles of eighty words, it declared the strikers a gang of criminals and empowered the army to shoot them.</t4324>
<t4325>After the decree was read, amidst a deafening jeer of protest, a captain replaced the lieutenant on the station roof, and with the gramophone horn signaled that he wanted to speak.</t4325> <t4326>The crowd fell silent again.</t4326>
<t4327>—Ladies and gentlemen —said the captain in a low, slow, somewhat tired voice—, you have five minutes to leave.</t4327>
<t4328>The jeering and the redoubled shouts drowned out the bugle call that announced the beginning of the deadline.</t4328> <t4329>Nobody moved.</t4329>
<t4330>—Five minutes have passed —said the captain in the same tone—.</t4330> <t4331>One more minute and we will open fire.</t4331>
<t4332>José Arcadio Segundo, sweating ice, took the child off his shoulders and handed him to the woman.</t4332> <t4333>“These bastards are capable of shooting,” she murmured.</t4333> <t4334>José Arcadio Segundo didn’t have time to speak, because he instantly recognized the hoarse voice of Colonel Gavilán echoing the woman’s words with a shout.</t4334> <t4335>Intoxicated by the tension, by the marvelous depth of the silence, and also convinced that nothing would move that crowd stunned by the fascination of death, José Arcadio Segundo stood on tiptoe above the heads in front of him, and for the first time in his life raised his voice.</t4335>
<t4336>—Bastards! —he shouted—.</t4336> <t4337>We give you the remaining minute.</t4337>
<t4338>At the end of his scream, something happened that did not cause him fright, but rather a kind of hallucination.</t4338> <t4339>The captain gave the order to fire and fourteen machine gun nests responded immediately.</t4339> <t4340>But everything seemed like a farce.</t4340> <t4341>It was as if the machine guns had been loaded with pyrotechnic tricks, because their eager rattling could be heard, and their incandescent spits could be seen, but there was not the slightest reaction, not a voice, not even a sigh, among the compact crowd that seemed petrified by an instant invulnerability.</t4341> <t4342>Suddenly, to one side of the station, a death cry shattered the enchantment: "Aaaay, my mother."</t4342> <t4343>A seismic force, a volcanic breath, a roar of cataclysm, exploded in the center of the crowd with a colossal expansive power.</t4343> <t4344>José Arcadio Segundo barely had time to lift the child, while the mother with the other was absorbed by the crowd centrifuged by panic.</t4344>
<t4345>Many years later, the boy would still recount, despite the neighbors continuing to believe him a crazy old man, that José Arcadio Segundo lifted him above his head, and let himself be dragged, almost in the air, as if floating in the terror of the crowd, towards an adjacent street.</t4345> <t4346>The boy's privileged position allowed him to see that at that moment the frenzied mass began to reach the corner and the line of machine guns opened fire.</t4346> <t4347>Several voices shouted at the same time:</t4347>
<t4348>—Get down on the ground!</t4348> <t4349>Get down on the ground!</t4349>
<t4350>Those in the front lines had already done so, swept away by the bursts of shrapnel.</t4350> <t4351>The survivors, instead of throwing themselves to the ground, tried to return to the square, and then panic gave a dragon's lash, sending them in a compact wave against the other compact wave moving in the opposite direction, driven by the other dragon's lash from the opposite street, where the machine guns were also firing relentlessly.</t4351> <t4352>They were cornered, spinning in a gigantic whirlwind that gradually shrank to its epicenter because its edges were systematically trimmed in a circle, like peeling an onion, by the insatiable and methodical scissors of the shrapnel.</t4352> <t4353>The boy saw a woman kneeling, with her arms in a cross, in a clear space, mysteriously forbidden to the stampede.</t4353> <t4354>There José Arcadio Segundo placed him, at the moment of collapsing with his face bathed in blood, before the colossal throng swept away the empty space, the kneeling woman, the light of the high drought sky, and the damn world where Úrsula Iguarán had sold so many little caramel animals.</t4354>
<t4355>When José Arcadio Segundo woke up, he was lying face up in the darkness.</t4355> <t4356>He realized he was on an endless and silent train, and that his hair was matted with dried blood and all his bones ached.</t4356> <t4357>He felt an unbearable sleepiness.</t4357> <t4358>Determined to sleep for many hours, safe from terror and horror, he settled on the side that hurt the least, and only then did he discover that he was lying on the dead.</t4358> <t4359>There was no free space in the wagon, except for the central aisle.</t4359> <t4360>Several hours must have passed since the massacre, because the corpses had the same temperature as plaster in autumn, and the same consistency of petrified foam, and those who had placed them in the wagon had had time to stack them in the order and direction in which banana bunches were transported.</t4360> <t4361>Trying to escape the nightmare, José Arcadio Segundo crawled from one wagon to another, in the direction the train was moving, and in the flashes that burst through the wooden slats as they passed through the sleeping towns, he saw the dead men, the dead women, the dead children, who were going to be thrown into the sea like rejected bananas.</t4361> <t4362>He only recognized one woman who sold refreshments in the square and Colonel Gavilán, who still had the belt with the Morelian silver buckle with which he had tried to make his way through the panic rolled up in his hand.</t4362> <t4363>When he reached the first wagon, he jumped into the darkness and lay in the ditch until the train finished passing.</t4363> <t4364>It was the longest he had ever seen, with almost two hundred freight wagons, and a locomotive at each end and a third in the center.</t4364> <t4365>It carried no lights, not even the red and green position lamps, and it slid along at a nocturnal and stealthy speed.</t4365> <t4366>On top of the wagons, the dark shapes of soldiers with mounted machine guns could be seen.</t4366>
<t4367>After midnight, a torrential downpour broke out.</t4367> <t4368>José Arcadio Segundo did not know where he had jumped off, but he knew that by walking in the opposite direction of the train, he would reach Macondo.</t4368> <t4369>After more than three hours of walking, soaked to the bone, with a terrible headache, he saw the first houses in the light of dawn.</t4369> <t4370>Attracted by the smell of coffee, he entered a kitchen where a woman with a child in her arms was leaning over the stove.</t4370>
<t4371>—Good —he said exhaustedly—.</t4371> <t4372>I am José Arcadio Segundo Buendía.</t4372>
<t4373>He pronounced the full name, letter by letter, to convince himself that he was alive.</t4373> <t4374>He did well, because the woman had thought it was an apparition upon seeing the gaunt, somber figure at the door, with his head and clothes dirty with blood, touched by the solemnity of death.</t4374> <t4375>She knew him.</t4375> <t4376>She brought a blanket for him to wrap himself in while his clothes dried by the stove, heated water for him to wash his wound, which was only a skin tear, and gave him a clean cloth to bandage his head.</t4376> <t4377>Then she served him a cup of coffee, without sugar, as she had been told the Buendías drank it, and opened his clothes near the fire.</t4377>
<t4378>José Arcadio Segundo did not speak until he finished drinking his coffee.</t4378>
<t4379>—There must have been around three thousand —he murmured.</t4379>
<t4380>—What?</t4380>
<t4381>—The dead —he clarified—.</t4381> <t4382>They must have been all the ones who were at the station.</t4382>
<t4383>The woman measured him with a look of pity.</t4383> <t4384>“There have been no deaths here,” she said.</t4384> <t4385>“Since the times of your uncle, the colonel, nothing has happened in Macondo.”</t4385> <t4386>In three kitchens where José Arcadio Segundo stopped before reaching the house, they told him the same thing: “There were no deaths.”</t4386> <t4387>He passed by the station square and saw the tables of fried foods piled on top of each other, and there too he found no trace of the massacre.</t4387> <t4388>The streets were deserted under the relentless rain and the houses were closed, with no signs of life inside.</t4388> <t4389>The only human news was the first bell for mass.</t4389> <t4390>He knocked on the door of Colonel Gavilán's house.</t4390> <t4391>A pregnant woman, whom he had seen many times, shut the door in his face.</t4391> <t4392>“He’s gone,” she said, frightened.</t4392> <t4393>“He went back to his homeland.”</t4393> <t4394>The main entrance of the fenced chicken coop was guarded, as always, by two local policemen who seemed like stone under the rain, with raincoats and rubber helmets.</t4394> <t4395>In their marginal street, the Antillean blacks sang the Saturday psalms in chorus.</t4395> <t4396>José Arcadio Segundo jumped over the backyard fence and entered the house through the kitchen.</t4396> <t4397>Santa Sofía de la Piedad barely raised her voice.</t4397> <t4398>“Don’t let Fernanda see you,” she said.</t4398> <t4399>“She was getting up a while ago.”</t4399> <t4400>As if fulfilling an implicit pact, she took the son to the chamber pot room, fixed Melquíades' rickety cot for him, and at two in the afternoon, while Fernanda was taking a nap, she passed him a plate of food through the window.</t4400>
<t4401>Aureliano Segundo had slept at home because the rain caught him there, and at three in the afternoon he was still waiting for it to stop.</t4401> <t4402>Informed secretly by Santa Sofía de la Piedad, at that hour he visited his brother in Melquíades' room.</t4402> <t4403>He also did not believe the version of the massacre nor the nightmare of the train loaded with the dead traveling towards the sea.</t4403> <t4404>The previous night they had read an extraordinary national decree, informing that the workers had obeyed the order to evacuate the station and were heading to their homes in peaceful caravans.</t4404> <t4405>The decree also informed that the union leaders, with a high patriotic spirit, had reduced their demands to two points: reform of medical services and construction of latrines in the homes.</t4405> <t4406>It was later reported that when the military authorities obtained the workers' agreement, they hurried to communicate it to Mr. Brown, and that he not only accepted the new conditions but also offered to pay for three days of public festivities to celebrate the end of the conflict.</t4406> <t4407>Only when the military asked him for a date to announce the signing of the agreement, he looked through the window at the sky streaked with lightning and made a deep gesture of uncertainty.</t4407>
<t4408>—It will be when it stops raining —he said—.</t4408> <t4409>While the rain lasts, we suspend all kinds of activities.</t4409>
<t4410>It hadn't rained for three months and it was a time of drought.</t4410> <t4411>But when Mr. Brown announced his decision, a torrential downpour fell across the entire banana zone, surprising José Arcadio Segundo on the road to Macondo.</t4411> <t4412>A week later, it was still raining.</t4412> <t4413>The official version, repeated and hammered a thousand times throughout the country by every means of dissemination the government could find, eventually prevailed: there were no deaths, the satisfied workers had returned to their families, and the banana company was suspending activities until the rain passed.</t4413> <t4414>Martial law continued, in anticipation that emergency measures might be necessary for the public calamity of the endless downpour, but the troops were quartered.</t4414> <t4415>During the day, the soldiers walked through the torrents in the streets, with their pants rolled up to mid-calf, playing shipwrecks with the children.</t4415> <t4416>At night, after the curfew, they would break down doors with rifle butts, drag suspects out of their beds, and take them on a one-way trip.</t4416> <t4417>It was still the search and extermination of the criminals, murderers, arsonists, and rebels of Decree Number Four, but the soldiers denied it even to the relatives of their victims, who crowded the commanders' office in search of news.</t4417> <t4418>“It must have been a dream,” the officers insisted.</t4418> <t4419>“Nothing has happened in Macondo, nothing is happening, and nothing will ever happen.</t4419> <t4420>This is a happy town.”</t4420> <t4421>Thus they consummated the extermination of the union leaders.</t4421>
<t4422>The only survivor was José Arcadio Segundo.</t4422> <t4423>One February night, the unmistakable knocks of rifle butts were heard at the door.</t4423> <t4424>Aureliano Segundo, who was still waiting for the rain to stop so he could go out, opened the door to six soldiers led by an officer.</t4424> <t4425>Soaked from the rain, without saying a word, they searched the house room by room, wardrobe by wardrobe, from the living rooms to the barn.</t4425> <t4426>Úrsula woke up when they turned on the light in the bedroom, and she did not let out a sigh during the search, but she kept her fingers crossed, moving them towards where the soldiers moved.</t4426> <t4427>Santa Sofía de la Piedad managed to warn José Arcadio Segundo, who was sleeping in Melquíades' room, but he understood that it was too late to attempt an escape.</t4427> <t4428>So Santa Sofía de la Piedad closed the door again, and he put on his shirt and shoes, and sat on the cot to wait for them to arrive.</t4428> <t4429>At that moment, they were searching the goldsmith's workshop.</t4429> <t4430>The officer had the padlock opened, and with a quick sweep of the flashlight, he saw the workbench and the glass cabinet with the acid bottles and instruments that were still in the same place where their owner had left them, and he seemed to understand that no one lived in that room.</t4430> <t4431>However, he cunningly asked Aureliano Segundo if he was a silversmith, and he explained that it had been Colonel Aureliano Buendía's workshop.</t4431> <t4432>"Aha," said the officer, and he turned on the light and ordered such a thorough search that they did not miss the eighteen little gold fishes that had not been melted down and were hidden behind the bottles in the tin can.</t4432> <t4433>The officer examined them one by one on the workbench and then became completely humanized.</t4433> <t4434>"I would like to take one, if you permit me," he said.</t4434> <t4435>"At one time they were a symbol of subversion, but now they are a relic."</t4435> <t4436>He was young, almost an adolescent, without any sign of shyness, and with a natural charm that had not been noticed until then.</t4436> <t4437>Aureliano Segundo gave him the little fish.</t4437> <t4438>The officer put it in his shirt pocket, with a childlike gleam in his eyes, and threw the others back in the can to put them where they were.</t4438>
<t4439>—It is an invaluable memory —he said—.</t4439> <t4440>Colonel Aureliano Buendía was one of our greatest men.</t4440>
<t4441>However, the blow of humanization did not modify his professional conduct.</t4441> <t4442>In front of Melquíades' room, which was once again locked, Santa Sofía de la Piedad turned to a last hope.</t4442> <t4443>“It’s been like a century since anyone lived in that room,” she said.</t4443> <t4444>The officer had it opened, scanned it with the beam of his flashlight, and Aureliano Segundo and Santa Sofía de la Piedad saw the Arab eyes of José Arcadio Segundo at the moment when the beam of light passed over his face, and they understood that this was the end of one anxiety and the beginning of another that would only find relief in resignation.</t4444> <t4445>But the officer continued examining the room with the flashlight and showed no sign of interest until he discovered the seventy-two chamber pots piled up in the closets.</t4445> <t4446>Then he turned on the light.</t4446> <t4447>José Arcadio Segundo was sitting on the edge of the cot, ready to leave, more solemn and thoughtful than ever.</t4447> <t4448>At the back were the shelves with the unstitched books, the rolls of parchment, and the clean and orderly work table, with the ink in the inkwells still fresh.</t4448> <t4449>There was the same purity in the air, the same clarity, the same privilege against dust and destruction that Aureliano Segundo had known in his childhood, and that only Colonel Aureliano Buendía could not perceive.</t4449> <t4450>But the officer was only interested in the chamber pots.</t4450>
<t4451>—How many people live in this house? —he asked.</t4451>
<t4452>—Five.</t4452>
<t4453>The officer, evidently, did not understand.</t4453> <t4454>He fixed his gaze on the space where Aureliano Segundo and Santa Sofía de la Piedad were still watching José Arcadio Segundo, and he too realized that the soldier was looking at him without seeing him.</t4454> <t4455>Then he turned off the light and adjusted the door.</t4455> <t4456>When he spoke to the soldiers, Aureliano Segundo understood that the young officer had seen the room with the same eyes with which Colonel Aureliano Buendía had seen it.</t4456>
<t4457>—It is true that no one has been in that room for at least a century —said the officer to the soldiers—.</t4457> <t4458>There must even be snakes in there.</t4458>
<t4459>When the door closed, José Arcadio Segundo was certain that his war had ended.</t4459> <t4460>Years before, Colonel Aureliano Buendía had spoken to him about the fascination of war and had tried to demonstrate it with countless examples drawn from his own experience.</t4460> <t4461>He had believed him.</t4461> <t4462>But the night the soldiers looked at him without seeing him, while he thought about the tension of the past few months, the misery of the prison, the panic at the station, and the train loaded with dead bodies, José Arcadio Segundo concluded that Colonel Aureliano Buendía was nothing more than a fraud or an idiot.</t4462> <t4463>He couldn't understand why so many words were needed to explain what one felt in war, when a single word sufficed: fear.</t4463> <t4464>In Melquíades' room, however, protected by the supernatural light, the sound of the rain, and the sensation of being invisible, he found the rest he had never had for a single moment in his previous life, and the only fear that persisted was that of being buried alive.</t4464> <t4465>He told this to Santa Sofía de la Piedad, who brought him his daily meals, and she promised to fight to stay alive beyond her strength to ensure that he would be buried dead.</t4465> <t4466>Free from all fear, José Arcadio Segundo then dedicated himself to reviewing Melquíades' parchments many times, and all the more content the less he understood them.</t4466> <t4467>Accustomed to the sound of the rain, which after two months became a new form of silence, the only thing that disturbed his solitude were the comings and goings of Santa Sofía de la Piedad.</t4467> <t4468>That is why he begged her to leave the food on the windowsill and lock the door.</t4468> <t4469>The rest of the family forgot about him, including Fernanda, who had no problem leaving him there when she learned that the soldiers had seen him without recognizing him.</t4469> <t4470>After six months of confinement, seeing that the soldiers had left Macondo, Aureliano Segundo removed the lock looking for someone to talk to while the rain passed.</t4470> <t4471>From the moment he opened the door, he felt assaulted by the stench of the chamber pots that were placed on the floor, all of them often used.</t4471> <t4472>José Arcadio Segundo, devoured by hair, indifferent to the air thickened by nauseating vapors, continued reading and rereading the unintelligible parchments.</t4472> <t4473>He was illuminated by a seraphic glow.</t4473> <t4474>He barely looked up when he felt the door open, but his brother needed only that glance to see the irreparable destiny of their great-grandfather repeated in it.</t4474>
<t4475>—There were more than three thousand —was all that José Arcadio Segundo said—.</t4475> <t4476>Now I am sure that they were all the ones who were at the station.</t4476>
<t4477>It rained for four years, eleven months, and two days.</t4477> <t4478>There were periods of drizzle when everyone put on their Sunday best and wore a convalescent face to celebrate the clearing, but soon they got used to interpreting the pauses as announcements of a resurgence.</t4478> <t4479>The sky was unpaved in storms of destruction, and the north sent hurricanes that chipped roofs and knocked down walls, and uprooted the last vines of the plantations.</t4479> <t4480>As happened during the insomnia plague, which Úrsula remembered during those days, the calamity itself inspired defenses against boredom.</t4480> <t4481>Aureliano Segundo was one of those who did the most to not succumb to idleness.</t4481> <t4482>He had gone to the house for some casual matter the night Mr. Brown summoned the storm, and Fernanda tried to help him with a half-broken umbrella she found in a closet.</t4482> <t4483>“No need,” he said.</t4483> <t4484>“I’ll stay here until it clears up.”</t4484> <t4485>It was not, of course, an unavoidable commitment, but he almost fulfilled it to the letter.</t4485> <t4486>Since his clothes were at Petra Cotes's house, he took off the ones he was wearing every three days and waited in his underwear while they were washed.</t4486> <t4487>To avoid getting bored, he devoted himself to fixing the numerous defects in the house.</t4487> <t4488>He adjusted hinges, oiled locks, screwed bolts, and leveled latches.</t4488> <t4489>For several months he was seen wandering with a toolbox that the gypsies must have forgotten in the times of José Arcadio Buendía, and no one knew if it was due to the involuntary exercise, the winter boredom, or the enforced abstinence, but his belly gradually deflated like a wineskin, and his beatific turtle face became less sanguine and his double chin less protuberant, until he ended up being less pachydermic and could tie his shoelaces again.</t4489> <t4490>Seeing him install doorknobs and disconnect clocks, Fernanda wondered if he was also falling into the vice of doing to undo, like Colonel Aureliano Buendía with his goldfish, Amaranta with the buttons and the shroud, José Arcadio Segundo with the parchments, and Úrsula with her memories.</t4490> <t4491>But it wasn’t true.</t4491> <t4492>The problem was that the rain disrupted everything, and the driest machines sprouted flowers among the gears if they weren’t oiled every three days, and the threads of the brocades rusted and saffron algae grew on the wet clothes.</t4492> <t4493>The atmosphere was so humid that fish could have entered through the doors and exited through the windows, navigating through the air of the rooms.</t4493> <t4494>One morning Úrsula woke up feeling she was ending in a swoon of placidity, and she had already asked for Father Antonio Isabel to be brought to her, even if on a stretcher, when Santa Sofía de la Piedad discovered that her back was paved with leeches.</t4494> <t4495>They removed them one by one, burning them with embers, before they finished draining her blood.</t4495> <t4496>It was necessary to dig channels to drain the house, and to clear it of toads and snails, so that the floors could dry, the bricks could be removed from the bed legs, and they could walk with shoes again.</t4496> <t4497>Busy with the numerous minutiae that demanded his attention, Aureliano Segundo didn’t realize he was getting old until one afternoon when he found himself contemplating the early sunset from a rocking chair, and thinking of Petra Cotes without shuddering.</t4497> <t4498>He would have had no problem returning to the insipid love of Fernanda, whose beauty had settled with maturity, but the rain had saved him from any passionate emergency, and had infused him with the spongy serenity of lack of appetite.</t4498> <t4499>He amused himself thinking about the things he could have done in another time with that rain that was already going on for a year.</t4499> <t4500>He had been one of the first to bring zinc sheets to Macondo, long before the banana company made them fashionable, just to roof Petra Cotes's bedroom with them and enjoy the deep intimacy that the rain’s crepitation produced in him at that time.</t4500> <t4501>But even those crazy memories of his extravagant youth left him impassive, as if in the last party he had exhausted his quotas of salaciousness, and only the wonderful prize of being able to recall them without bitterness or regrets remained.</t4501> <t4502>One might have thought that the deluge had given him the opportunity to sit and reflect, and that the hustle of pliers and oil cans had awakened in him a late longing for so many useful trades he could have done and didn’t do in life, but neither was true, because the temptation of sedentariness and domesticity that was haunting him was not the result of reflection or lesson learned.</t4502> <t4503>It came from much further away, unearthed by the pitchfork of the rain, from the times when he read in Melquíades's room the prodigious fables of flying carpets and whales that fed on ships with crews.</t4503> <t4504>It was during those days that, in a moment of Fernanda’s carelessness, little Aureliano appeared in the corridor, and his grandfather discovered the secret of his identity.</t4504> <t4505>He cut his hair, dressed him, taught him to lose his fear of people, and very soon it was clear that he was a legitimate Aureliano Buendía, with his high cheekbones, his look of astonishment, and his solitary air.</t4505> <t4506>For Fernanda, it was a relief.</t4506> <t4507>She had long measured the magnitude of her pride, but couldn’t find a way to remedy it, because the more she thought about solutions, the less rational they seemed.</t4507> <t4508>If she had known that Aureliano Segundo would take things as he did, with a good grandfatherly complacency, she wouldn’t have gone around in circles or given so many deadlines, but would have freed herself from the mortification the previous year.</t4508> <t4509>For Amaranta Úrsula, who had already lost her baby teeth, the nephew was like a slippery toy that consoled her from the boredom of the rain.</t4509> <t4510>Aureliano Segundo then remembered the English encyclopedia that no one had touched again in Meme’s old bedroom.</t4510> <t4511>He started by showing the children the plates, especially those of animals, and later the maps and photographs of remote countries and famous people.</t4511> <t4512>Since he didn’t know English, and could barely distinguish the most well-known cities and the most common personalities, he began to invent names and legends to satisfy the children’s insatiable curiosity.</t4512>
<t4513>Fernanda truly believed that her husband was waiting for the rain to stop to return to his concubine.</t4513> <t4514>In the first months of the rain, she feared that he would try to slip into her bedroom, and that she would have to endure the shame of revealing to him that she had been incapacitated for reconciliation since the birth of Amaranta Úrsula.</t4514> <t4515>That was the reason for her anxious correspondence with the invisible doctors, interrupted by the frequent disasters of the mail.</t4515> <t4516>During the first months, when it was known that the trains were derailing in the storm, a letter from the invisible doctors indicated to her that her letters were being lost.</t4516> <t4517>Later, when contact with her unknown correspondents was interrupted, she seriously considered putting on the tiger mask her husband had used in the bloody carnival, to be examined under a fictitious name by the doctors of the banana company.</t4517> <t4518>But one of the many people who often passed by the house bringing the unpleasant news of the deluge had told her that the company was dismantling its dispensaries to take them to lands where the rain had stopped.</t4518> <t4519>Then she lost hope.</t4519> <t4520>She resigned herself to wait for the rain to pass and the mail to normalize, and in the meantime, she alleviated her secret ailments with inspired resources, because she would have preferred to die rather than put herself in the hands of the only doctor left in Macondo, the extravagant Frenchman who fed on donkey grass.</t4520> <t4521>She had approached Úrsula, hoping that she knew some remedy for her ailments.</t4521> <t4522>But the tortuous habit of not calling things by their name led her to put the former in the latter, and to substitute the birthed for the expelled, and to change flows for burns so that everything would be less shameful, so Úrsula reasonably concluded that the disorders were not uterine, but intestinal, and advised her to take a dose of calomel on an empty stomach.</t4522> <t4523>If it hadn't been for that ailment, which would have been nothing shameful for someone who wasn't also sick with prudishness, and if it hadn't been for the loss of the letters, Fernanda wouldn't have minded the rain, because after all, her whole life had been as if it were raining.</t4523> <t4524>She did not change the schedules nor forgave the rituals.</t4524> <t4525>When the table was still raised on bricks and the chairs placed on planks so that the diners wouldn't get their feet wet, she continued serving with linen tablecloths and Chinese dishes, and lighting the candelabras at dinner, because she considered that calamities could not be used as an excuse for the relaxation of customs.</t4525> <t4526>No one had looked out onto the street again.</t4526> <t4527>If it had been up to Fernanda, they would never have done so again, not only since it started raining, but long before, since she considered that doors were invented to be closed, and that curiosity about what happened in the street was a thing for harlots.</t4527> <t4528>However, she was the first to look out when they announced that the funeral of Colonel Gerineldo Márquez was passing by, although what she saw then through the half-open window left her in such a state of affliction that for a long time she regretted her weakness.</t4528>
<t4529>No cortege more desolate could have been conceived.</t4529> <t4530>They had placed the coffin on an ox cart upon which they built a shelter of banana leaves, but the pressure of the rain was so intense and the streets were so muddy that at every step the wheels got stuck and the shelter was about to collapse.</t4530> <t4531>The sad streams of water falling on the coffin were soaking the flag they had placed on top of it, which was actually the flag stained with blood and gunpowder, repudiated by the most dignified veterans.</t4531> <t4532>On the coffin, they had also placed the saber with copper and silk tassels, the same one that Colonel Gerineldo Márquez used to hang on the coat rack in the living room to enter unarmed into Amaranta's sewing room.</t4532> <t4533>Behind the cart, some barefoot and all with their pants rolled up to mid-calf, the last survivors of the capitulation of Neerlandia splashed through the mud, carrying in one hand a walking stick and in the other a wreath of paper flowers faded by the rain.</t4533> <t4534>They appeared like an unreal vision on the street that still bore the name of Colonel Aureliano Buendía, and everyone looked at the house as they passed, and turned at the corner of the square, where they had to ask for help to get the cart unstuck.</t4534> <t4535>Úrsula had been brought to the door by Santa Sofía de la Piedad.</t4535> <t4536>She followed the burial's vicissitudes with such attention that no one doubted she was seeing it, especially because her raised hand, like that of an announcing archangel, moved with the jolts of the cart.</t4536>
<t4537>—Goodbye, Gerineldo, my son —he shouted—.</t4537> <t4538>Give my regards to my people and tell them we will see each other when it clears up.</t4538>
<t4539>Aureliano Segundo helped her back to bed, and with the same informality with which he always treated her, he asked her the meaning of her farewell.</t4539>
<t4540>—It's true —she said—.</t4540> <t4541>I'm just waiting for the rain to stop so I can die.</t4541>
<t4542>The state of the streets alarmed Aureliano Segundo.</t4542> <t4543>Belatedly concerned about the fate of his animals, he threw on a waxed canvas and went to Petra Cotes' house.</t4543> <t4544>He found her in the yard, water up to her waist, trying to dislodge the corpse of a horse.</t4544> <t4545>Aureliano Segundo helped her with a pole, and the enormous bloated body flipped over and was carried away by the torrent of liquid mud.</t4545> <t4546>Since the rain began, Petra Cotes had done nothing but clear her yard of dead animals.</t4546> <t4547>In the first weeks, she sent messages to Aureliano Segundo to take urgent measures, and he had replied that there was no rush, that the situation was not alarming, that something would be thought of when it cleared up.</t4547> <t4548>She sent word that the pastures were flooding, that the cattle were fleeing to higher lands where there was nothing to eat, and that they were at the mercy of tigers and plague.</t4548> <t4549>"There's nothing to be done," Aureliano Segundo replied.</t4549> <t4550>"Others will be born when it clears up."</t4550> <t4551>Petra Cotes had seen them die in clusters, and could barely keep up with butchering those that got stuck.</t4551> <t4552>She watched with mute helplessness as the deluge mercilessly exterminated a fortune that was once considered the largest and most solid in Macondo, and of which only the stench remained.</t4552> <t4553>When Aureliano Segundo decided to go see what was happening, he found only the corpse of the horse and a scrawny mule among the ruins of the stable.</t4553> <t4554>Petra Cotes saw him arrive without surprise, without joy or resentment, and allowed herself only an ironic smile.</t4554>
<t4555>—At a good time! —he said.</t4555>
<t4556>She was aged, just skin and bones, and her lanceolate eyes of a carnivorous animal had become sad and tame from watching the rain so much.</t4556> <t4557>Aureliano Segundo stayed at her house for more than three months, not because he felt better there than at his family's house, but because he needed all that time to make the decision to once again put on the piece of waxed canvas.</t4557> <t4558>"There's no rush," he said, as he had said in the other house.</t4558> <t4559>"Let's wait for the rain to stop in the next few hours."</t4559> <t4560>During the first week, he got used to the wear and tear that time and rain had inflicted on his concubine's health, and little by little he began to see her as she was before, remembering her joyous excesses and the delirious fecundity that her love provoked in the animals, and partly out of love and partly out of interest, one night during the second week, he woke her up with urgent caresses.</t4560> <t4561>Petra Cotes did not react.</t4561> <t4562>"Sleep peacefully," she murmured.</t4562> <t4563>"These times are no longer for such things."</t4563> <t4564>Aureliano Segundo saw himself in the ceiling mirrors, saw Petra Cotes' spine like a row of spools strung on a bundle of withered nerves, and understood that she was right, not because of the times, but because of themselves, who were no longer up for such things.</t4564>
<t4565>Aureliano Segundo returned to the house with his trunks, convinced that not only Úrsula, but all the inhabitants of Macondo, were waiting for the rain to stop so they could die.</t4565> <t4566>He had seen them as he passed by, sitting in the living rooms with their gaze absorbed and their arms crossed, feeling an entire time pass, an untamed time, because it was useless to divide it into months and years, and the days into hours, when nothing could be done but watch the rain.</t4566> <t4567>The children received Aureliano Segundo with joy, who once again played the asthmatic accordion for them.</t4567> <t4568>But the concert did not capture their attention as much as the encyclopedic sessions, so once again they gathered in Meme's bedroom, where Aureliano Segundo's imagination turned the airship into a flying elephant looking for a place to sleep among the clouds.</t4568> <t4569>On one occasion, he found a man on horseback who, despite his exotic attire, retained a familiar air, and after much examination, he concluded that it was a portrait of Colonel Aureliano Buendía.</t4569> <t4570>He showed it to Fernanda, and she also admitted the resemblance of the rider not only to the colonel but to all the members of the family, although in truth he was a Tartar warrior.</t4570> <t4571>Thus, time passed for him, between the Colossus of Rhodes and the snake charmers, until his wife announced that there were no more than six kilos of salted meat and a sack of rice left in the granary.</t4571>
<t4572>—And now what do you want me to do? —he asked.</t4572>
<t4573>—I don't know —replied Fernanda—.</t4573> <t4574>That's a matter for men.</t4574>
<t4575>—Well —said Aureliano Segundo—, something will be done when it stops raining.</t4575>
<t4576>He remained more interested in the encyclopedia than in the domestic problem, even when he had to settle for scraps and a bit of rice for lunch.</t4576> <t4577>"Now it's impossible to do anything," he said.</t4577> <t4578>"It can't rain forever."</t4578> <t4579>And the more he delayed addressing the barn's urgencies, the more intense Fernanda's indignation grew, until her occasional protests, her infrequent outbursts, overflowed into an uncontrollable, unleashed torrent that began one morning like the monotonous drone of a guitar, and as the day progressed, it rose in pitch, becoming richer and more splendid.</t4579> <t4580>Aureliano Segundo didn't become aware of the nagging until the next day, after breakfast, when he felt overwhelmed by a buzzing that was then more fluid and louder than the sound of the rain, and it was Fernanda, pacing around the house, lamenting that she had been educated like a queen only to end up as a servant in a house of lunatics, with a lazy, idolatrous, libertine husband who lay on his back waiting for bread to rain from the sky, while she broke her back trying to keep afloat a home propped up with pins, where there was so much to do, so much to endure and correct from dawn until bedtime, that she reached the bed with her eyes full of glass dust, and yet no one had ever said good morning, Fernanda, how did you sleep, Fernanda, nor had they asked her, even out of courtesy, why she was so pale or why she woke up with those violet circles under her eyes, even though she didn't expect, of course, that such words would come from the rest of a family that had always seen her as a nuisance, like the rag used to lower the pot, like a painted puppet on the wall, and who always gossiped about her in the corners, calling her sanctimonious, calling her a Pharisee, calling her a lizard, and even Amaranta, rest in peace, had said out loud that she was one of those who confused the rectum with the temples, blessed be God, what words, and she had endured everything with resignation for the Holy Father's intentions, but she couldn't take it anymore when the wicked José Arcadio Segundo said that the family's downfall had been opening the doors to a cachaca, imagine, a bossy cachaca, good heavens, a cachaca daughter of bad saliva, of the same ilk as the cachacos the government sent to kill workers, can you believe it, and he was referring to none other than her, the goddaughter of the Duke of Alba, a lady of such lineage that she made the wives of presidents' stomachs churn, a noblewoman of such blood that she had the right to sign with eleven peninsular surnames, and who was the only mortal in that town of bastards who didn't feel flustered in front of sixteen place settings, only for her adulterous husband to laugh and say that so many spoons and forks, and so many knives and little spoons were not a Christian thing, but a centipede's, and the only one who could determine with her eyes closed when to serve white wine, and from which side and in which glass, and when to serve red wine, and from which side and in which glass, unlike the rustic Amaranta, rest in peace, who thought white wine was served during the day and red wine at night, and the only one on the entire coast who could boast of never having relieved herself except in golden chamber pots, only for Colonel Aureliano Buendía, rest in peace, to have the audacity to ask with his bad Masonic bile where she had earned that privilege, if it was that she didn't shit crap, but astromelias, imagine, with those words, and for Renata, her own daughter, who had indiscreetly seen her major waters in the bedroom, to reply that indeed the chamber pot was very golden and very heraldic, but what it contained was pure crap, physical crap, and worse than others because it was cachaca crap, imagine, her own daughter, so she had never had illusions about the rest of the family, but she still had the right to expect a bit more consideration from her husband, since for better or worse he was her sacramental spouse, her author, her legitimate wrongdoer, who had taken upon himself by his own free and sovereign will the grave responsibility of taking her from her paternal home, where she never lacked or suffered for anything, where she wove funeral palms for entertainment, since her godfather had sent a letter with his signature and the seal of his ring imprinted in wax, just to say that his goddaughter's hands were not made for worldly tasks, except to play the clavichord, and yet her foolish husband had taken her from her home with all the warnings and admonitions and had brought her to that hellish cauldron where one couldn't breathe from the heat, and before she finished putting away her Pentecost diets, he had already left with his wandering trunks and his rogue accordion to indulge in adultery with an unfortunate woman whose buttocks alone, well, it was said, whose swaying buttocks alone were enough to guess that she was one, that she was one, the complete opposite of her, who was a lady in the palace or the pigsty, at the table or in bed, a lady by birth, God-fearing, obedient to His laws and submissive to His designs, and with whom, of course, he couldn't do the acrobatics and vagrancies he did with the other, who of course was up for anything, like French madams, and worse still, thinking about it, because at least they had the honesty to put a red light at the door, such filth, imagine, no more was needed, with the only and beloved daughter of Doña Renata Argote and Don Fernando del Carpio, and especially of him, of course, a holy man, a great Christian, Knight of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre, one of those who receive directly from God the privilege of remaining intact in the tomb, with skin as smooth as bridal satin and eyes as alive and clear as emeralds.</t4580>
<t4581>—That's not true —Aureliano Segundo interrupted her—, when they brought him, he was already stinking.</t4581>
<t4582>He had had the patience to listen to her for an entire day, until he caught her in a mistake.</t4582> <t4583>Fernanda paid no attention to him, but she lowered her voice.</t4583> <t4584>That night, during dinner, the exasperating buzz of the nagging had drowned out the sound of the rain.</t4584> <t4585>Aureliano Segundo ate very little, with his head down, and retired early to the bedroom.</t4585> <t4586>At breakfast the next day, Fernanda was trembling, looking as if she had slept poorly, and seemed completely relieved of her resentments.</t4586> <t4587>However, when her husband asked if it would be possible to have a soft-boiled egg, she did not simply reply that they had run out of eggs since the previous week, but launched into a virulent diatribe against men who spent their time admiring their own navels and then had the gall to ask for lark livers at the table.</t4587> <t4588>Aureliano Segundo took the children to look at the encyclopedia, as always, and Fernanda pretended to tidy up Meme's room, just so he could hear her murmur that, of course, one needed to have a lot of nerve to tell the poor innocents that Colonel Aureliano Buendía was pictured in the encyclopedia.</t4588> <t4589>In the afternoon, while the children were napping, Aureliano Segundo sat in the corridor, and Fernanda pursued him there, provoking him, tormenting him, circling around him with her relentless drone like a gadfly, saying that, of course, while there was nothing left to eat but stones, her husband sat like a Persian sultan watching the rain, because that was all he was, a lazy bum, a kept man, good for nothing, lazier than cotton fluff, used to living off women, and convinced that he had married Jonah's wife, who stayed calm with the story of the whale.</t4589> <t4590>Aureliano Segundo listened to her for more than two hours, impassive, as if he were deaf.</t4590> <t4591>He did not interrupt her until very late in the afternoon when he could no longer bear the drum-like resonance that tormented his head.</t4591>
<t4592>—Shut up already, please —he begged.</t4592>
<t4593>Fernanda, on the contrary, raised her voice.</t4593> <t4594>“I have no reason to keep quiet,” she said.</t4594> <t4595>“Anyone who doesn’t want to hear me can leave.”</t4595> <t4596>Then Aureliano Segundo lost control.</t4596> <t4597>He stood up without haste, as if he only intended to stretch his bones, and with a perfectly regulated and methodical fury, he began grabbing the pots of begonias, the fern pots, the oregano jars, and one by one he smashed them against the floor.</t4597> <t4598>Fernanda was frightened, for she had not until then had a clear awareness of the tremendous inner strength of the tirade, but it was already too late for any attempt at rectification.</t4598> <t4599>Drunk on the unstoppable torrent of release, Aureliano Segundo broke the glass of the window, and one by one, without hurrying, he took out the pieces of the dinnerware and shattered them against the floor.</t4599> <t4600>Systematic, serene, with the same slowness with which he had papered the house with bills, he then began breaking against the walls the Bohemian glassware, the hand-painted vases, the paintings of maidens in boats loaded with roses, the mirrors with golden frames, and everything that was breakable from the living room to the granary, and he finished with the kitchen jar that burst in the center of the patio with a deep explosion.</t4600> <t4601>Then he washed his hands, threw the waxed canvas over himself, and before midnight returned with some stiff strips of salted meat, several sacks of rice and weevily corn, and some withered bunches of bananas.</t4601> <t4602>From then on, food was never lacking again.</t4602>
<t4603>Amaranta Úrsula and little Aureliano would remember the deluge as a happy time.</t4603> <t4604>Despite Fernanda's strictness, they splashed in the backyard swamps, hunted lizards to dismember them, and played at poisoning the soup by adding butterfly wing dust when Santa Sofía de la Piedad wasn't looking.</t4604> <t4605>Úrsula was their most entertaining toy.</t4605> <t4606>They treated her like a large decrepit doll, carrying her around the corners, dressed in colorful rags with her face painted with soot and annatto, and once they were about to gouge out her eyes as they did to toads with pruning shears.</t4606> <t4607>Nothing caused them as much joy as her ravings.</t4607> <t4608>Indeed, something must have happened in her brain in the third year of the rain, because little by little she lost her sense of reality, confusing the present time with remote periods of her life, to the point that on one occasion she spent three days crying inconsolably over the death of Petronila Iguarán, her great-grandmother, who had been buried for over a century.</t4608> <t4609>She sank into such a state of absurd confusion that she believed little Aureliano was her son the colonel from the time they took him to see the ice, and that José Arcadio, who was then in the seminary, was the eldest son who went off with the gypsies.</t4609> <t4610>She spoke so much about the family that the children learned to organize imaginary visits for her with people who not only had died long ago but had lived in different eras.</t4610> <t4611>Sitting on the bed with her hair covered in ash and her face covered with a red handkerchief, Úrsula was happy amidst the unreal relatives that the children described in detail, as if they had truly known them.</t4611> <t4612>Úrsula conversed with her ancestors about events that occurred before her own existence, enjoyed the news they gave her, and cried with them over deaths much more recent than the interlocutors themselves.</t4612> <t4613>The children soon noticed that during these ghostly visits, Úrsula always posed a question aimed at establishing who had brought a life-sized plaster Saint Joseph to the house during the war to keep it safe until the rain passed.</t4613> <t4614>It was thus that Aureliano Segundo remembered the fortune buried somewhere only Úrsula knew, but the questions and cunning maneuvers he devised were useless, because in the labyrinths of her delirium, she seemed to retain a margin of lucidity to defend that secret, which she would only reveal to the one who proved to be the true owner of the buried gold.</t4614> <t4615>She was so skillful and strict that when Aureliano Segundo instructed one of his party companions to pretend to be the owner of the fortune, she ensnared him in a meticulous interrogation filled with subtle traps.</t4615>
<t4616>Convinced that Úrsula would take the secret to her grave, Aureliano Segundo hired a team of diggers under the pretext of building drainage channels in the yard and backyard, and he himself probed the ground with iron bars and all kinds of metal detectors, without finding anything resembling gold in three months of exhaustive explorations.</t4616><t4617>Later, he turned to Pilar Ternera, hoping that the cards would see more than the diggers, but she began by explaining that any attempt was useless unless Úrsula was the one to cut the deck.</t4617><t4618>However, she confirmed the existence of the treasure, specifying that it consisted of seven thousand two hundred and fourteen coins buried in three canvas sacks with copper wire drawstrings, within a circle with a radius of one hundred and twenty-two meters, taking Úrsula's bed as the center, but warned that it would not be found until the rain stopped and the suns of three consecutive Junes turned the mud into dust.</t4618><t4619>The profusion and meticulous vagueness of the data seemed to Aureliano Segundo so similar to spiritualist fables that he insisted on his endeavor despite it being August and it would have been necessary to wait at least three years to satisfy the conditions of the prediction.</t4619><t4620>The first thing that astonished him, although it also increased his confusion, was finding that there were exactly one hundred and twenty-two meters from Úrsula's bed to the backyard fence.</t4620><t4621>Fernanda feared he was as crazy as his twin brother when she saw him taking measurements, and even more so when he ordered the digging teams to deepen the trenches by another meter.</t4621><t4622>Gripped by an exploratory delirium comparable only to that of his great-grandfather when he was searching for the route of inventions, Aureliano Segundo lost the last pockets of fat he had left, and the old resemblance to his twin brother became accentuated again, not only because of his thinning figure but also because of his distant air and introspective attitude.</t4622><t4623>He no longer took care of the children.</t4623><t4624>He ate at any hour, covered in mud from head to toe, and did so in a corner of the kitchen, barely responding to the occasional questions from Santa Sofía de la Piedad.</t4624><t4625>Seeing him work in that manner, as she had never imagined he could, Fernanda believed that his recklessness was diligence, that his greed was selflessness, and that his stubbornness was perseverance, and she felt remorse for the virulence with which she had railed against his idleness.</t4625><t4626>But Aureliano Segundo was not then in the mood for merciful reconciliations.</t4626><t4627>Buried up to his neck in a swamp of dead branches and rotten flowers, he turned the garden soil inside out after finishing with the yard and backyard, and drilled so deeply into the foundations of the house's eastern gallery that one night they were awakened in terror by what seemed to be a cataclysm, both from the tremors and the dreadful underground creaking, and it turned out that three rooms were collapsing and a chilling crack had opened from the corridor to Fernanda's bedroom.</t4627><t4628>Aureliano Segundo did not give up the exploration because of this.</t4628><t4629>Even when the last hopes had faded and the only thing that seemed to make any sense were the predictions of the cards, he reinforced the damaged foundations, filled the crack with mortar, and continued digging on the western side.</t4629><t4630>He was still there in the second week of the following June when the rain began to subside and the clouds started to lift, and it was clear that it was about to stop raining at any moment.</t4630><t4631>And so it did.</t4631><t4632>One Friday at two in the afternoon, the world was illuminated by a dim, reddish, and rough sun like brick dust, almost as cool as water, and it did not rain again for ten years.</t4632>
<t4633>Macondo was in ruins.</t4633> <t4634>In the swamps of the streets, there were shattered furniture, skeletons of animals covered with red lilies, last memories of the hordes of newcomers who fled from Macondo as hastily as they had arrived.</t4634> <t4635>The houses hastily erected during the banana fever had been abandoned.</t4635> <t4636>The banana company dismantled its facilities.</t4636> <t4637>Only the rubble remained of the old fenced city.</t4637> <t4638>The wooden houses, the cool terraces where serene afternoons of card games took place, seemed ravaged by a premonition of the prophetic wind that years later would erase Macondo from the face of the earth.</t4638> <t4639>The only human trace left by that voracious breath was a glove of Patricia Brown in the car smothered by bougainvilleas.</t4639> <t4640>The enchanted region that José Arcadio Buendía explored in the times of the foundation, and where later the banana plantations prospered, was a swamp of rotting stumps, on whose distant horizon the silent foam of the sea could be seen for several years.</t4640> <t4641>Aureliano Segundo suffered a crisis of affliction the first Sunday he wore dry clothes and went out to recognize the town.</t4641> <t4642>The survivors of the catastrophe, the same ones who already lived in Macondo before it was shaken by the hurricane of the banana company, were sitting in the middle of the street enjoying the first suns.</t4642> <t4643>They still retained on their skin the green of algae and the smell of corners imprinted by the rain, but deep in their hearts, they seemed satisfied to have recovered the town where they were born.</t4643> <t4644>The Street of the Turks was once again as it was before, in the times when the Arabs with slippers and earrings who roamed the world exchanging macaws for trinkets found in Macondo a good place to rest from their millenary condition of nomadic people.</t4644> <t4645>On the other side of the rain, the merchandise of the bazaars was falling to pieces, the fabrics displayed at the door were streaked with moss, the counters undermined by termites, and the walls gnawed by humidity, but the Arabs of the third generation were sitting in the same place and in the same attitude as their fathers and grandfathers, taciturn, impassive, invulnerable to time and disaster, as alive or as dead as they were after the insomnia plague and the thirty-two wars of Colonel Aureliano Buendía.</t4645> <t4646>Their strength of spirit in the face of the rubble of the gaming tables, the fried food stalls, the shooting galleries, and the alley where dreams were interpreted and the future was foretold was so astonishing that Aureliano Segundo asked them with his usual informality what mysterious resources they had used to avoid sinking in the storm, how the hell they had managed not to drown, and one by one, from door to door, they returned a sly smile and a dreamy look, and all gave him, without prior agreement, the same answer:</t4646>
<t4647>—Swimming.</t4647>
<t4648>Petra Cotes was perhaps the only native who had the heart of an Arab.</t4648> <t4649>She had seen the last wreckage of her stables and barns dragged away by the storm, but she had managed to keep the house standing.</t4649> <t4650>In the past year, she had sent urgent messages to Aureliano Segundo, and he had replied that he did not know when he would return home, but that in any case, he would bring a chest of gold coins to pave the bedroom.</t4650> <t4651>Then she had dug deep into her heart, seeking the strength to survive the misfortune, and had found a reflective and just rage, with which she had vowed to restore the fortune squandered by her lover and recently wiped out by the flood.</t4651> <t4652>It was such an unbreakable decision that Aureliano Segundo returned home eight months after the last message, and found her green, disheveled, with sunken eyelids and skin frosted by scabies, but she was writing numbers on little pieces of paper to hold a raffle.</t4652> <t4653>Aureliano Segundo was astonished, and he was so emaciated and solemn that Petra Cotes did not believe that the one who had come back to find her was the lover of a lifetime, but rather the twin brother.</t4653>
<t4654>—You’re crazy —he said—.</t4654> <t4655>Unless you’re planning to raffle off the bones.</t4655>
<t4656>Then she told him to look into the bedroom, and Aureliano Segundo saw the mule.</t4656> <t4657>It was with its skin stuck to its bones, like its owner, but as lively and determined as she was.</t4657> <t4658>Petra Cotes had fed it with her rage, and when she had no more herbs, nor corn, nor roots, she sheltered it in her own bedroom and fed it the percale sheets, the Persian tapestries, the plush bedspreads, the velvet curtains, and the canopy embroidered with gold threads and silk tassels from the episcopal bed.</t4658>
<t4659>Úrsula had to make a great effort to fulfill her promise to die when the rain stopped.</t4659> <t4660>The bursts of lucidity, which were so scarce during the rain, became more frequent starting in August, when the arid wind began to blow, suffocating the rose bushes and petrifying the swamps, and eventually spreading over Macondo the scorching dust that forever covered the rusted zinc roofs and the centenary almond trees.</t4660> <t4661>Úrsula cried out of pity upon discovering that for more than three years she had been a toy for the children.</t4661> <t4662>She washed her painted face, removed the colorful strips, the dried lizards and toads, and the rosaries and old Arab necklaces that had been hung all over her body, and for the first time since Amaranta's death, she left the bed without anyone's help to rejoin family life.</t4662> <t4663>The spirit of her invincible heart guided her in the darkness.</t4663> <t4664>Those who noticed her stumbles and bumped into her archangelic arm always raised to head height thought she could barely manage her body, but still did not believe she was blind.</t4664> <t4665>She did not need to see to realize that the flowerbeds, cultivated with such care since the first reconstruction, had been destroyed by the rain and ravaged by Aureliano Segundo's excavations, and that the walls and cement floors were cracked, the furniture loose and faded, the doors unhinged, and the family threatened by a spirit of resignation and gloom that would have been inconceivable in her time.</t4665> <t4666>Moving by feel through the empty bedrooms, she perceived the continuous thunder of termites drilling the wood, the snipping of moths in the wardrobes, and the devastating clatter of the enormous red ants that had thrived in the deluge and were undermining the house's foundations.</t4666> <t4667>One day she opened the chest of saints and had to ask Santa Sofía de la Piedad for help to remove the cockroaches that jumped out from inside and had already pulverized the clothes.</t4667> <t4668>"It is not possible to live in this neglect," she said.</t4668> <t4669>"At this rate, we will end up devoured by the beasts."</t4669> <t4670>From then on, she did not have a moment of rest.</t4670> <t4671>Up before dawn, she resorted to whoever was available, including the children.</t4671> <t4672>She put out in the sun the few clothes that were still usable, drove away the cockroaches with surprise insecticide attacks, scraped the termite veins on doors and windows, and suffocated the ants in their nests with quicklime.</t4672> <t4673>The fever of restoration eventually led her to the forgotten rooms.</t4673> <t4674>She had the room where José Arcadio Buendía's head had dried up while searching for the philosopher's stone cleared of debris and cobwebs, put the silver workshop that had been ransacked by soldiers in order, and finally asked for the keys to Melquíades' room to see what state it was in.</t4674> <t4675>Faithful to José Arcadio Segundo's will, who had forbidden any intrusion unless there was a real indication that he had died, Santa Sofía de la Piedad resorted to all kinds of subterfuges to mislead Úrsula.</t4675> <t4676>But her determination to not abandon even the most hidden and useless corner of the house to the insects was so inflexible that she overcame every obstacle they put in her way, and after three days of insistence, she managed to have the room opened.</t4676> <t4677>She had to hold onto the door frame to avoid being knocked down by the stench, but it took her no more than two seconds to remember that the seventy-two chamber pots of the schoolgirls were stored there, and that on one of the first rainy nights, a patrol of soldiers had searched the house looking for José Arcadio Segundo and had not been able to find him.</t4677>
<t4678>—Blessed be God! —he exclaimed, as if he had seen it all—.</t4678> <t4679>So much effort to instill good manners in you, only for you to end up living like a pig.</t4679>
<t4680>José Arcadio Segundo kept rereading the parchments.</t4680> <t4681>The only visible things in the intricate tangle of hair were the teeth streaked with green moss and the motionless eyes.</t4681> <t4682>Upon recognizing the voice of his great-grandmother, he turned his head towards the door, tried to smile, and unknowingly repeated an old phrase of Úrsula's.</t4682>
<t4683>—What did you want —he murmured—, time passes.</t4683>
<t4684>—That's right —said Úrsula—, but not quite.</t4684>
<t4685>In saying it, she became aware that she was giving the same reply that Colonel Aureliano Buendía had received in his condemned cell, and once again she shuddered at the realization that time did not pass, as she had just admitted, but rather went around in circles.</t4685><t4686>But even then, she did not give resignation a chance.</t4686><t4687>She scolded José Arcadio Segundo as if he were a child, and insisted that he bathe and shave and lend his strength to finish restoring the house.</t4687><t4688>The mere idea of leaving the room that had provided him peace terrified José Arcadio Segundo.</t4688><t4689>He shouted that no human power could make him leave, because he did not want to see the train of two hundred cars loaded with dead bodies that departed from Macondo to the sea every evening.</t4689><t4690>“They are all the ones who were at the station,” he shouted.</t4690><t4691>“Three thousand four hundred and eight.”</t4691><t4692>Only then did Úrsula understand that he was in a world of darkness more impenetrable than hers, as unbreakable and solitary as that of the great-grandfather.</t4692><t4693>She left him in the room, but managed to ensure that they no longer locked the door, that they cleaned every day, that they threw the chamber pots in the trash and left only one, and that they kept José Arcadio Segundo as clean and presentable as the great-grandfather had been in his long captivity under the chestnut tree.</t4693><t4694>At first, Fernanda interpreted that bustle as a fit of senile madness, and barely suppressed her exasperation.</t4694><t4695>But around that time, José Arcadio announced from Rome that he planned to go to Macondo before taking his perpetual vows, and the good news filled her with such enthusiasm that overnight she found herself watering the flowers four times a day so that her son would not form a bad impression of the house.</t4695><t4696>It was that same incentive that induced her to hasten her correspondence with the invisible doctors, and to replace the pots of ferns and oregano, and the begonias in the corridor, long before Úrsula found out that they had been destroyed by Aureliano Segundo’s exterminating fury.</t4696><t4697>Later, she sold the silver service, and bought ceramic dishes, soup tureens, pewter ladles, and alpaca cutlery, impoverishing the cupboards accustomed to the Company of India’s crockery and Bohemian glassware.</t4697><t4698>Úrsula always tried to go further.</t4698><t4699>“Open doors and windows,” she shouted.</t4699><t4700>“Cook meat and fish, buy the biggest turtles, let the strangers come to lay their mats in the corners and urinate on the rosebushes, let them sit at the table to eat as many times as they want, and let them belch and rant and smear everything with their boots, and let them do whatever they want with us, because that is the only way to ward off ruin.”</t4700><t4701>But it was a vain illusion.</t4701><t4702>She was already too old and living too long to repeat the miracle of the little caramel animals, and none of her descendants had inherited her strength.</t4702><t4703>The house remained closed by Fernanda’s order.</t4703>
<t4704>Aureliano Segundo, who had moved his trunks back to Petra Cotes' house, barely had the means to keep the family from starving.</t4704><t4705>With the raffle of the mule, Petra Cotes and he had bought other animals, with which they managed to set up a rudimentary lottery business.</t4705><t4706>Aureliano Segundo went from house to house, offering the little tickets that he himself painted with colored inks to make them more attractive and convincing, and perhaps he didn't realize that many bought them out of gratitude, and most out of compassion.</t4706><t4707>However, even the most pious buyers acquired the chance to win a pig for twenty cents or a heifer for thirty-two, and they got so excited with hope that on Tuesday night they overflowed Petra Cotes' patio waiting for the moment when a randomly chosen child would draw the winning number from the bag.</t4707><t4708>It didn't take long for it to turn into a weekly fair, as from dusk tables of fried foods and drink stands were set up in the patio, and many of the winners would sacrifice the animal they had won right there on the condition that others provide the music and the liquor, so that without having wished it, Aureliano Segundo suddenly found himself playing the accordion again and participating in modest gluttony tournaments.</t4708><t4709>These humble replicas of the revelries of other days served for Aureliano Segundo himself to discover how much his spirits had declined and to what extent his ingenuity as a master cumbia player had dried up.</t4709><t4710>He was a changed man.</t4710><t4711>The one hundred and twenty kilos he had during the time he challenged La Elefanta had reduced to seventy-eight; his candid and bloated turtle face had turned into that of an iguana, and he was always close to boredom and fatigue.</t4711><t4712>For Petra Cotes, however, he was never a better man than at that time, perhaps because she confused with love the compassion he inspired in her, and the feeling of solidarity that misery had awakened in both of them.</t4712><t4713>The dismantled bed ceased to be a place of excesses and became a refuge for confidences.</t4713><t4714>Freed from the repeating mirrors they had sold to buy raffle animals, and from the lustful damasks and velvets that the mule had eaten, they stayed awake until very late with the innocence of two sleepless grandparents, taking advantage of the time they used to waste on wasting themselves to do accounts and move cents around.</t4714><t4715>Sometimes the first roosters would catch them making and unmaking little piles of coins, taking a bit from here to put it there, so that this would be enough to please Fernanda, and that for Amaranta Úrsula's shoes, and this other for Santa Sofía de la Piedad who hadn't had a new dress since the noisy times, and this for making the coffin if Úrsula died, and this for the coffee that went up a cent per pound every three months, and this for the sugar that sweetened less and less, and this for the firewood that was still wet from the deluge, and this other for the paper and colored ink for the tickets, and what was left to start paying off the value of the April calf, whose hide they miraculously saved because it got symptomatic anthrax when almost all the raffle numbers were sold.</t4715><t4716>Those masses of poverty were so pure that they always allocated the best part for Fernanda, and they never did it out of remorse or charity, but because her well-being mattered more to them than their own.</t4716><t4717>What really happened to them, although neither of them realized it, was that both thought of Fernanda as the daughter they would have liked to have and didn't, to the point that on one occasion they resigned themselves to eating porridge for three days so she could buy a Dutch tablecloth.</t4717><t4718>However, no matter how hard they worked, no matter how much money they skimmed and how many tricks they devised, their guardian angels would fall asleep from exhaustion while they moved coins around trying to make them at least enough to live on.</t4718><t4719>In the insomnia left by the bad accounts, they wondered what had happened in the world for the animals not to give birth with the same confusion as before, why the money disintegrated in their hands, and why the people who not long ago burned bundles of bills at the cumbiamba considered it a highway robbery to charge twelve cents for the raffle of six hens.</t4719><t4720>Aureliano Segundo thought without saying it that the problem wasn't in the world, but in some hidden place in the mysterious heart of Petra Cotes, where something had happened during the deluge that made the animals sterile and the money elusive.</t4720><t4721>Intrigued by this enigma, he dug so deeply into her feelings that in seeking interest he found love, because in trying to make her love him, he ended up loving her.</t4721><t4722>Petra Cotes, for her part, loved him more as she felt his affection grow, and thus in the fullness of autumn she came to believe again in the youthful superstition that poverty was a servitude of love.</t4722><t4723>They then recalled the reckless revelries, the ostentatious wealth, and the unrestrained fornication as a hindrance, and lamented how much life it had cost them to find the paradise of shared solitude.</t4723><t4724>Madly in love after so many years of sterile complicity, they enjoyed the miracle of loving each other as much at the table as in bed, and they became so happy that even when they were two exhausted old people, they still frolicked like bunnies and fought like dogs.</t4724>
<t4725>The raffles never yielded much.</t4725> <t4726>At the beginning, Aureliano Segundo spent three days a week locked in his old rancher's office, drawing ticket by ticket, painting with a certain finesse a little red cow, a green piglet, or a group of blue hens, depending on the animal being raffled, and he modeled with a good imitation of printed letters the name that Petra Cotes thought was good to baptize the business: Divine Providence Raffles.</t4726> <t4727>But over time he felt so tired after drawing up to two thousand tickets a week that he had the animals, the name, and the numbers made into rubber stamps, and then the work was reduced to moistening them on pads of different colors.</t4727> <t4728>In their later years, they came up with the idea of replacing the numbers with riddles, so that the prize would be shared among all those who guessed correctly, but the system turned out to be so complicated and lent itself to so many suspicions that they gave up after the second attempt.</t4728>
<t4729>Aureliano Segundo was so busy trying to consolidate the prestige of his raffles that he barely had time to see the children.</t4729> <t4730>Fernanda enrolled Amaranta Úrsula in a private little school that accepted no more than six students, but she refused to allow Aureliano to attend public school.</t4730> <t4731>She considered that she had already conceded too much by allowing him to leave the room.</t4731> <t4732>Moreover, at that time, schools only accepted legitimate children of Catholic marriages, and in the birth certificate that had been pinned to Aureliano's little gown by a nurse when he was sent to the house, he was registered as a foundling.</t4732> <t4733>So he remained confined, at the mercy of the charitable vigilance of Santa Sofía de la Piedad and the mental fluctuations of Úrsula, discovering the narrow world of the house as explained to him by the grandmothers.</t4733> <t4734>He was delicate, lanky, with a curiosity that drove adults crazy, but unlike the inquisitive and sometimes clairvoyant gaze that the colonel had at his age, his was blinking and somewhat distracted.</t4734> <t4735>While Amaranta Úrsula was in kindergarten, he hunted worms and tortured insects in the garden.</t4735> <t4736>But once when Fernanda caught him putting scorpions in a box to place them on Úrsula's mat, she confined him in Meme's old bedroom, where he distracted himself during his solitary hours by reviewing the encyclopedia plates.</t4736> <t4737>There Úrsula found him one afternoon while she was sprinkling the house with serenaded water and a bunch of nettles, and despite having been with him many times, she asked him who he was.</t4737>
<t4738>—I am Aureliano Buendía —he said.</t4738>
<t4739>—It's true —she replied—.</t4739> <t4740>It's time for you to start learning silversmithing.</t4740>
<t4741>She mistook him for her son again, because the warm wind that followed the flood and infused Ursula's brain with occasional bursts of lucidity had just passed.</t4741><t4742>She never regained her sanity.</t4742><t4743>When she entered the bedroom, she found Petronila Iguarán there, with her cumbersome hoop skirt and the beaded bag she wore for formal visits, and she found Tranquilina María Miniata Alacoque Buendía, her grandmother, fanning herself with a peacock feather in her cripple's rocking chair, and her great-grandfather Aureliano Arcadio Buendía with his fake viceroyal guard uniform, and Aureliano Iguarán, her father, who had invented a prayer to make the worms fall off the cows, and her timid mother, and the cousin with the pig's tail, and José Arcadio Buendía and his dead children, all sitting in chairs that had been leaned against the wall as if they were not visiting, but at a wake.</t4743><t4744>She would weave a colorful chatter, commenting on matters from distant places and times without coincidence, so that when Amaranta Úrsula returned from school and Aureliano grew tired of the encyclopedia, they would find her sitting on the bed, talking to herself, and lost in a labyrinth of the dead.</t4744><t4745>"Fire!" she once shouted in terror, and for a moment she sowed panic in the house, but what she was announcing was the fire of a stable she had witnessed at the age of four.</t4745><t4746>She came to mix the past with the present so much that in the two or three bursts of lucidity she had before she died, no one knew for certain whether she was talking about what she felt or what she remembered.</t4746><t4747>Little by little she shrank, became fetid, mummified in life, to the point that in her last months she was a prune lost inside her nightgown, and her always-raised arm ended up looking like the leg of a spider monkey.</t4747><t4748>She would remain motionless for several days, and Santa Sofía de la Piedad had to shake her to convince herself that she was alive, and she would sit her on her lap to feed her spoonfuls of sugar water.</t4748><t4749>She looked like a newly born old woman.</t4749><t4750>Amaranta Úrsula and Aureliano would carry her around the bedroom, lay her on the altar to see that she was barely bigger than the Baby Jesus, and one afternoon they hid her in a barn closet where the rats could have eaten her.</t4750><t4751>One Palm Sunday they entered the bedroom while Fernanda was at mass, and carried Ursula by the nape and the ankles.</t4751>
<t4752>—Poor great-great-grandmother —said Amaranta Úrsula—, she died of old age.</t4752>
<t4753>Úrsula was startled.</t4753>
<t4754>—I'm alive! —she said.</t4754>
<t4755>—You see —said Amaranta Úrsula, holding back her laughter—, he doesn't even breathe.</t4755>
<t4756>—I'm talking! —shouted Úrsula.</t4756>
<t4757>—He doesn't even speak —said Aureliano—.</t4757> <t4758>He died like a little cricket.</t4758>
<t4759>Then Úrsula surrendered to the evidence.</t4759> <t4760>“My God,” she exclaimed in a low voice.</t4760> <t4761>“So this is death.”</t4761> <t4762>She began an endless, rushed, profound prayer that lasted for more than two days, and by Tuesday had degenerated into a jumble of pleas to God and practical advice to prevent the red ants from toppling the house, to never let the lamp in front of Remedios's daguerreotype go out, and to ensure that no Buendía would marry someone of their own blood, because their children would be born with pig tails.</t4762> <t4763>Aureliano Segundo tried to take advantage of her delirium to get her to confess where the buried gold was, but once again his pleas were useless.</t4763> <t4764>“When the owner appears,” Úrsula said, “God will enlighten him to find it.”</t4764> <t4765>Santa Sofía de la Piedad was certain she would find her dead at any moment, because during those days she observed a certain bewilderment in nature: the roses smelled like wormwood, a gourd of chickpeas fell and the grains remained on the floor in a perfect geometric order in the shape of a starfish, and one night she saw a line of luminous orange disks pass through the sky.</t4765>
<t4766>She was found dead on Holy Thursday.</t4766> <t4767>The last time they had helped her figure out her age, back in the days of the banana company, they had estimated it to be between one hundred fifteen and one hundred twenty-two years.</t4767> <t4768>They buried her in a little box that was barely larger than the basket in which Aureliano had been carried, and very few people attended the funeral, partly because not many remembered her, and partly because that noon it was so hot that disoriented birds crashed like buckshot against the walls and broke through the wire mesh of the windows to die in the bedrooms.</t4768>
<t4769>At first, it was believed to be a plague.</t4769> <t4770>Housewives were exhausted from sweeping up dead birds, especially during siesta time, and men carted them to the river.</t4770> <t4771>On Easter Sunday, the centenarian Father Antonio Isabel declared from the pulpit that the death of the birds was due to the evil influence of the Wandering Jew, whom he had seen the night before.</t4771> <t4772>He described it as a hybrid of a billy goat crossed with a heretic female, an infernal beast whose breath scorched the air and whose visit would lead to the conception of monstrosities by newlyweds.</t4772> <t4773>Not many paid attention to his apocalyptic sermon, as the town was convinced that the priest was raving due to his age.</t4773> <t4774>But a woman woke everyone at dawn on Wednesday, because she found some bipedal cloven hoof prints.</t4774> <t4775>They were so clear and unmistakable that those who went to see them did not doubt the existence of a terrifying creature similar to the one described by the priest, and they banded together to set traps in their yards.</t4775> <t4776>That's how they managed to capture it.</t4776> <t4777>Two weeks after Úrsula's death, Petra Cotes and Aureliano Segundo were startled awake by a colossal calf's cry coming from the neighborhood.</t4777> <t4778>When they got up, a group of men was already pulling the monster off the sharp stakes they had set at the bottom of a pit covered with dry leaves, and it had stopped bellowing.</t4778> <t4779>It weighed as much as an ox, despite its height being no greater than that of an adolescent, and from its wounds flowed a green, oily blood.</t4779> <t4780>Its body was covered in rough fur, infested with tiny ticks, and its skin was petrified by a crust of barnacles, but contrary to the priest's description, its human parts were more like those of a sickly angel than a man, with smooth and skillful hands, large and twilight eyes, and on its shoulder blades, the scarred and calloused stumps of powerful wings that must have been chopped off with farmer's axes.</t4780> <t4781>They hung it by the ankles from an almond tree in the square so no one would miss seeing it, and when it began to rot, they incinerated it in a bonfire, as it could not be determined whether its bastard nature was that of an animal to be thrown in the river or a Christian to be buried.</t4781> <t4782>It was never established whether it was indeed the cause of the birds' deaths, but the newlyweds did not conceive the foretold monstrosities, nor did the intensity of the heat diminish.</t4782>
<t4783>Rebeca died at the end of that year.</t4783> <t4784>Argénida, her lifelong maid, asked the authorities for help to break down the door of the bedroom where her mistress had been locked up for three days, and they found her in the solitary bed, curled up like a shrimp, with her head bald from ringworm and her thumb in her mouth.</t4784> <t4785>Aureliano Segundo took charge of the burial, and tried to restore the house to sell it, but the destruction was so fierce that the walls peeled off just after being painted, and there wasn't enough thick mortar to prevent the weeds from crushing the floors and the ivy from rotting the beams.</t4785>
<t4786>Everything had been this way since the flood.</t4786> <t4787>The apathy of the people contrasted with the voracity of oblivion, which little by little was mercilessly gnawing away at memories, to the extent that during those times, on a new anniversary of the Neerlandia treaty, some emissaries from the president of the republic arrived in Macondo to finally deliver the decoration several times rejected by Colonel Aureliano Buendía, and they spent an entire afternoon looking for someone who could tell them where to find any of his descendants.</t4787> <t4788>Aureliano Segundo was tempted to accept it, believing it to be a solid gold medal, but Petra Cotes persuaded him of the indignity when the emissaries were already preparing proclamations and speeches for the ceremony.</t4788> <t4789>Around that time, the gypsies returned, the last heirs of Melquíades' science, and they found the town so run-down and its inhabitants so isolated from the rest of the world that they went back into the houses dragging magnetized iron bars as if they were truly the latest discovery of Babylonian sages, and they once again concentrated the sun's rays with the giant magnifying glass, and there were those who stood with their mouths agape watching pots fall and kettles roll, and those who paid fifty cents to be amazed by a gypsy woman who took out and put in her false teeth.</t4789> <t4790>A dilapidated yellow train that neither brought nor took anyone, and that barely stopped at the deserted station, was all that remained of the crowded train on which Mr. Brown hooked his car with a glass roof and bishop's armchairs, and of the fruit trains with one hundred and twenty cars that took an entire afternoon to pass by.</t4790> <t4791>The curial delegates who had gone to investigate the report on the strange bird mortality and the sacrifice of the Wandering Jew found Father Antonio Isabel playing blind man's bluff with the children, and believing that his report was the product of a senile hallucination, they took him to an asylum.</t4791> <t4792>Shortly after, they sent Father Augusto Ángel, a crusader of the new batches, intransigent, bold, fearless, who personally rang the bells several times a day so that spirits would not become lethargic, and who went from house to house waking up the sleepyheads to go to mass, but before a year had passed, he too was defeated by the negligence that permeated the air, by the burning dust that aged and clogged everything, and by the drowsiness caused by the meatballs at lunch in the unbearable heat of the siesta.</t4792>
<t4793>Upon Úrsula's death, the house fell back into a state of neglect from which not even a will as resolute and vigorous as that of Amaranta Úrsula could rescue it. Many years later, as a woman without prejudices, cheerful and modern, with her feet firmly planted in the world, she opened doors and windows.</t4793><t4794>To ward off ruin, she restored the garden, exterminated the red ants that were already roaming the corridor in broad daylight, and tried in vain to revive the forgotten spirit of hospitality.</t4794><t4795>Fernanda's cloistered passion erected an insurmountable barrier to Úrsula's torrential hundred years.</t4795><t4796>Not only did she refuse to open the doors when the arid wind passed by, but she also had the windows sealed with wooden crosses, obeying her father's command to bury herself alive.</t4796><t4797>The costly correspondence with the invisible doctors ended in failure.</t4797><t4798>After numerous postponements, she locked herself in her bedroom on the agreed date and time, covered only by a white sheet and with her head facing north. At one in the morning, she felt a cloth soaked in a glacial liquid cover her face.</t4798><t4799>When she woke up, the sun was shining through the window, and she had a barbaric seam in the shape of an arc that started at her groin and ended at her sternum.</t4799><t4800>But before she could complete the prescribed rest, she received a bewildered letter from the invisible doctors, who said they had examined her for six hours without finding anything corresponding to the symptoms she had so often and scrupulously described.</t4800><t4801>In reality, her pernicious habit of not calling things by their name had given rise to a new confusion, as the only thing the telepathic surgeons found was a uterine prolapse that could be corrected with the use of a pessary.</t4801><t4802>The disillusioned Fernanda tried to obtain more precise information, but the unknown correspondents never replied to her letters again.</t4802><t4803>She felt so overwhelmed by the weight of an unknown word that she decided to stifle her shame and ask what a pessary was. Only then did she learn that the French doctor had hanged himself from a beam three months earlier and had been buried against the will of the people by an old comrade-in-arms of Colonel Aureliano Buendía.</t4803><t4804>Then she confided in her son José Arcadio, and he sent her the pessaries from Rome, along with a small explanatory booklet that she threw into the toilet after memorizing it, so that no one would know the nature of her ailments.</t4804><t4805>It was a useless precaution because the only people living in the house barely paid attention to her.</t4805><t4806>Santa Sofía de la Piedad wandered in solitary old age, cooking the little they ate, and almost entirely dedicated to the care of José Arcadio Segundo.</t4806><t4807>Amaranta Úrsula, inheriting some of the charms of Remedios the Beauty, spent her time doing her schoolwork, which she previously wasted tormenting Úrsula, and began to show good judgment and dedication to her studies, which rekindled in Aureliano Segundo the good hope that Meme had inspired in him.</t4807><t4808>He had promised to send her to finish her studies in Brussels, according to a custom established during the banana company era, and that illusion led him to try to revive the lands devastated by the deluge.</t4808><t4809>The few times he was seen at the house then, it was for Amaranta Úrsula, as over time he had become a stranger to Fernanda, and young Aureliano grew more elusive and introspective as he approached puberty.</t4809><t4810>Aureliano Segundo hoped that old age would soften Fernanda's heart so that the boy could join the life of a town where surely no one would have bothered to make suspicious speculations about his origin.</t4810><t4811>But Aureliano himself seemed to prefer confinement and solitude, showing no malice in wanting to know the world that began at the street door.</t4811><t4812>When Úrsula opened Melquíades' room, he began to hover around it, peeking through the ajar door, and no one knew when he developed a reciprocal affection for José Arcadio Segundo.</t4812><t4813>Aureliano Segundo discovered this friendship long after it had begun, when he heard the boy talking about the massacre at the station.</t4813><t4814>It happened one day when someone lamented at the table about the ruin that befell the town when the banana company left, and Aureliano contradicted them with the maturity and expertise of an older person.</t4814><t4815>His point of view, contrary to the general interpretation, was that Macondo had been a prosperous and well-directed place until the banana company disordered, corrupted, and exploited it, with its engineers provoking the deluge as an excuse to evade commitments with the workers.</t4815><t4816>Speaking with such good judgment that Fernanda thought it a sacrilegious parody of Jesus among the doctors, the boy described with precise and convincing details how the army machine-gunned more than three thousand workers cornered at the station and loaded the corpses onto a two-hundred-car train to dump them into the sea.</t4816><t4817>Convinced, like most people, of the official truth that nothing had happened, Fernanda was scandalized by the idea that the boy had inherited the anarchist instincts of Colonel Aureliano Buendía and ordered him to be silent.</t4817><t4818>Aureliano Segundo, on the other hand, recognized his twin brother's version.</t4818><t4819>In reality, despite everyone thinking him crazy, José Arcadio Segundo was at that time the most lucid inhabitant of the house.</t4819><t4820>He taught young Aureliano to read and write, introduced him to the study of the parchments, and instilled in him such a personal interpretation of what the banana company meant for Macondo that many years later, when Aureliano joined the world, it would be thought that he was telling a hallucinatory version because it was radically contrary to the false one that historians had accepted and enshrined in school textbooks.</t4820><t4821>In the secluded little room, where the arid wind, dust, and heat never reached, both recalled the atavistic vision of an old man with a crow-wing hat who spoke about the world behind the window many years before they were born.</t4821><t4822>Both discovered at the same time that it was always March and always Monday there, and then they understood that José Arcadio Buendía was not as crazy as the family said, but was the only one lucid enough to glimpse the truth that time also suffered setbacks and accidents, and could therefore splinter and leave an eternalized fraction in a room.</t4822><t4823>José Arcadio Segundo had also managed to classify the cryptic letters of the parchments.</t4823><t4824>He was sure they corresponded to an alphabet of forty-seven to fifty-three characters, which when separated looked like little spiders and ticks, and in Melquíades' exquisite handwriting, they looked like pieces of clothing hung out to dry on a wire.</t4824><t4825>Aureliano remembered seeing a similar table in the English encyclopedia, so he brought it to the room to compare it with José Arcadio Segundo's.</t4825><t4826>They were indeed identical.</t4826>
<t4827>At the time when he came up with the riddle lottery, Aureliano Segundo would wake up with a lump in his throat, as if he were holding back the urge to cry.</t4827> <t4828>Petra Cotes interpreted it as one of the many disorders caused by the bad situation, and every morning, for more than a year, she would touch his palate with a swab of honey and give him radish syrup.</t4828> <t4829>When the lump in his throat became so oppressive that it was hard for him to breathe, Aureliano Segundo visited Pilar Ternera to see if she knew of any herb that could help.</t4829> <t4830>The unyielding grandmother, who had reached a hundred years old while running a small clandestine brothel, did not trust therapeutic superstitions, but consulted the matter with the cards.</t4830> <t4831>She saw the horse of gold with its throat wounded by the steel of the jack of swords, and deduced that Fernanda was trying to get her husband to return home using the discredited method of sticking pins in his portrait, but had caused an internal tumor due to her clumsy knowledge of dark arts.</t4831> <t4832>Since Aureliano Segundo had no other portraits than those from the wedding, and the copies were all intact in the family album, he kept searching the house during his wife's inattentive moments, and finally found half a dozen pessaries in their original boxes at the bottom of the wardrobe.</t4832> <t4833>Believing that the small red rubber rings were objects of witchcraft, he put one in his pocket to show Pilar Ternera.</t4833> <t4834>She couldn't determine their nature, but found them so suspicious that she had the entire half dozen brought to her and burned them in a bonfire she lit in the yard.</t4834> <t4835>To counteract Fernanda's supposed curse, she instructed Aureliano Segundo to wet a brooding hen and bury it alive under the chestnut tree, and he did it with such good faith that when he finished covering the disturbed earth with dry leaves, he already felt he could breathe better.</t4835> <t4836>For her part, Fernanda interpreted the disappearance as a reprisal from the invisible doctors, and she sewed a drawstring pocket inside her camisole, where she kept the new pessaries her son sent her.</t4836>
<t4837>Six months after the burial of the hen, Aureliano Segundo woke up at midnight with a fit of coughing, feeling as if he were being strangled from the inside with crab pincers.</t4837><t4838>It was then that he understood that no matter how many magical pessaries he destroyed and how many conjured hens he soaked, the only sad truth was that he was dying.</t4838><t4839>He didn't tell anyone.</t4839><t4840>Tormented by the fear of dying without sending Amaranta Úrsula to Brussels, he worked like he had never done before, and instead of one, he held three weekly raffles.</t4840><t4841>From very early on, he was seen going around the town, even in the most remote and miserable neighborhoods, trying to sell the little tickets with an anxiety that was only conceivable in a dying man.</t4841><t4842>"Here is the Divine Providence," he proclaimed.</t4842><t4843>"Don't let it go, it only comes once every hundred years."</t4843><t4844>He made touching efforts to appear cheerful, friendly, talkative, but just seeing his sweat and pallor was enough to know that he couldn't bear it.</t4844><t4845>Sometimes he would stray into vacant lots, where no one would see him, and sit for a moment to rest from the pincers tearing him apart inside.</t4845><t4846>Even at midnight, he was in the tolerance neighborhood, trying to console the lonely women who sobbed next to the victrolas with sermons of good luck.</t4846><t4847>"This number hasn't come up in four months," he would tell them, showing them the little tickets.</t4847><t4848>"Don't let it go, life is shorter than you think."</t4848><t4849>They ended up losing respect for him, mocking him, and in his last months, they no longer called him Don Aureliano, as they had always done, but instead called him to his face Don Divine Providence.</t4849><t4850>His voice filled with false notes, it became unsteady and ended up fading into a dog's growl, but he still had the will to keep the excitement for the prizes in Petra Cotes' yard from waning.</t4850><t4851>However, as he lost his voice and realized that soon he would no longer be able to bear the pain, he understood that it was not with raffled pigs and goats that his daughter would get to Brussels, so he conceived the idea of holding the fabulous raffle of the lands destroyed by the flood, which could well be restored by someone with capital.</t4851><t4852>It was such a spectacular initiative that the mayor himself announced it with a proclamation, and societies were formed to buy tickets at a hundred pesos each, which sold out in less than a week.</t4852><t4853>On the night of the raffle, the winners threw a lavish party, comparable only to the good times of the banana company, and Aureliano Segundo played the forgotten songs of Francisco the Man on the accordion for the last time, but he could no longer sing them.</t4853>
<t4854>Two months later, Amaranta Úrsula went to Brussels.</t4854><t4855>Aureliano Segundo gave her not only the money from the extraordinary raffle, but also what he had managed to save in the previous months, and the very little he obtained from selling the pianola, the clavichord, and other items that had fallen out of favor.</t4855><t4856>According to his calculations, that fund was enough for her studies, so only the cost of the return ticket remained pending.</t4856><t4857>Fernanda opposed the trip until the last moment, scandalized by the idea that Brussels was so close to the perdition of Paris, but she was reassured by a letter Father Ángel gave her for a boarding house for young Catholic women run by nuns, where Amaranta Úrsula promised to live until the end of her studies.</t4857><t4858>Additionally, the parish priest arranged for her to travel under the care of a group of Franciscan nuns who were going to Toledo, where they hoped to find trustworthy people to send her to Belgium.</t4858><t4859>While the hurried correspondence that made this coordination possible was underway, Aureliano Segundo, helped by Petra Cotes, took care of Amaranta Úrsula's luggage.</t4859><t4860>The night they prepared one of Fernanda's bridal trunks, things were so well arranged that the student knew by heart which dresses and velvet slippers she should wear for the Atlantic crossing, and the blue cloth coat with copper buttons, and the cordovan shoes she should wear when disembarking.</t4860><t4861>She also knew how she should walk to avoid falling into the water when boarding via the platform, that she should never separate from the nuns or leave the cabin except to eat, and that under no circumstances should she answer questions from strangers of any gender on the high seas.</t4861><t4862>She carried a small bottle with drops for seasickness and a notebook written in Father Ángel's own hand, with six prayers to ward off the storm.</t4862><t4863>Fernanda made her a canvas belt to keep the money, and showed her how to wear it tight to her body so she wouldn't have to take it off even to sleep.</t4863><t4864>She tried to give her the gold chamber pot washed with lye and disinfected with alcohol, but Amaranta Úrsula rejected it for fear that her schoolmates would make fun of her.</t4864><t4865>A few months later, at the time of his death, Aureliano Segundo would remember her as he saw her the last time, trying unsuccessfully to lower the dusty glass of the second-class carriage to hear Fernanda's last recommendations.</t4865><t4866>She wore a pink silk dress with a small bouquet of artificial pansies on the brooch of her left shoulder; cordovan shoes with a strap and low heel, and satin stockings with elastic garters at the calves.</t4866><t4867>She had a small body, loose and long hair, and the lively eyes that Úrsula had at her age, and the way she said goodbye, without crying but without smiling, revealed the same strength of character.</t4867><t4868>Walking alongside the carriage as it accelerated, and holding Fernanda by the arm so she wouldn't trip, Aureliano Segundo could barely return her wave when his daughter blew him a kiss with the tips of her fingers.</t4868><t4869>The spouses remained motionless under the scorching sun, watching the train blend into the black dot on the horizon, and holding each other by the arm for the first time since their wedding day.</t4869>
<t4870>On the ninth of August, before the first letter from Brussels was received, José Arcadio Segundo was talking with Aureliano in Melquíades' room, and without any preamble, he said:</t4870>
<t4871>—Always remember that there were more than three thousand of them and that they were thrown into the sea.</t4871>
<t4872>Then he fell face down on the parchments and died with his eyes open.</t4872> <t4873>At that very moment, in Fernanda's bed, his twin brother reached the end of the prolonged and terrible martyrdom of the iron crabs that had gnawed at his throat.</t4873> <t4874>A week earlier, he had returned home, voiceless, breathless, and almost just skin and bones, with his wandering trunks and his rogue accordion, to fulfill the promise of dying next to his wife.</t4874> <t4875>Petra Cotes helped him gather his clothes and saw him off without shedding a tear, but she forgot to give him the patent leather shoes he wanted to wear in the coffin.</t4875> <t4876>So when she learned that he had died, she dressed in black, wrapped the shoes in a newspaper, and asked Fernanda for permission to see the body.</t4876> <t4877>Fernanda did not let her past the door.</t4877>
<t4878>—Put yourself in my place —pleaded Petra Cotes—.</t4878> <t4879>Imagine how much I must have loved him to endure this humiliation.</t4879>
<t4880>—There is no humiliation that a concubine does not deserve —replied Fernanda—.</t4880> <t4881>So wait for another one of the many to die to put those boots on them.</t4881>
<t4882>In fulfillment of her promise, Santa Sofía de la Piedad slit the throat of José Arcadio Segundo's corpse with a kitchen knife to ensure he would not be buried alive.</t4882> <t4883>The bodies were placed in identical coffins, and it was seen that they became identical again in death, as they had been until adolescence.</t4883> <t4884>Aureliano Segundo's old drinking buddies placed a wreath on his coffin that had a purple ribbon with a sign: Move aside cows, life is short.</t4884> <t4885>Fernanda was so outraged by the irreverence that she ordered the wreath to be thrown in the trash.</t4885> <t4886>In the last-minute tumult, the sad drunks who took them out of the house confused the coffins and buried them in the wrong graves.</t4886>
<t4887>Aureliano did not leave Melquíades' room for a long time.</t4887> <t4888>He memorized the fantastic legends of the unbound book, the synthesis of the studies of Hermann, the cripple; the notes on demonological science, the keys to the philosopher's stone, the Centuries of Nostradamus and his investigations on the plague, so that he reached adolescence knowing nothing of his time, but with the basic knowledge of a medieval man.</t4888> <t4889>At any hour he entered the room, Santa Sofía de la Piedad found him absorbed in reading.</t4889> <t4890>She brought him a bowl of coffee without sugar at dawn, and at noon a plate of rice with fried plantain slices, which was the only thing eaten in the house after the death of Aureliano Segundo.</t4890> <t4891>She worried about cutting his hair, removing his nits, adapting the old clothes she found in forgotten trunks, and when his mustache began to sprout, she brought him the barber's razor and the little gourd for the foam of Colonel Aureliano Buendía.</t4891> <t4892>None of his children resembled him as much, not even Aureliano José, especially because of the pronounced cheekbones, and the resolute and somewhat ruthless line of his lips.</t4892> <t4893>As it happened to Úrsula with Aureliano Segundo when he studied in the room, Santa Sofía de la Piedad believed that Aureliano talked to himself.</t4893> <t4894>In reality, he conversed with Melquíades.</t4894> <t4895>One scorching noon, shortly after the death of the twins, she saw against the glare of the window the gloomy old man with the crow-wing hat, like the materialization of a memory that had been in her mind long before she was born.</t4895> <t4896>Aureliano had finished classifying the alphabet of the parchments.</t4896> <t4897>So when Melquíades asked him if he had discovered in what language they were written, he did not hesitate to answer.</t4897>
<t4898>—In Sanskrit —he said.</t4898>
<t4899>Melquíades revealed to him that his opportunities to return to the room were numbered.</t4899> <t4900>But he went peacefully to the meadows of definitive death, because Aureliano had time to learn Sanskrit in the years remaining until the parchments turned a century old and could be deciphered.</t4900> <t4901>It was he who indicated to him that in the alley that ended at the river, where in the times of the banana company the future was foretold and dreams were interpreted, a wise Catalan had a bookstore where there was a Sanskrit Primer that would be devoured by moths six years later if he did not hurry to buy it.</t4901> <t4902>For the first time in her long life, Santa Sofía de la Piedad let a feeling show, and it was a feeling of astonishment, when Aureliano asked her to bring him the book that was to be found between the Jerusalem Delivered and Milton's poems, on the far right of the second row of the shelves.</t4902> <t4903>Since she did not know how to read, she memorized the paragraph, and got the money by selling one of the seventeen little gold fish that remained in the workshop, and which only she and Aureliano knew where they had been placed the night the soldiers searched the house.</t4903>
<t4904>Aureliano advanced in his Sanskrit studies, while Melquíades became less and less frequent and more distant, fading away in the radiant clarity of midday.</t4904> <t4905>The last time Aureliano felt his presence, it was barely an invisible presence that murmured: "I died of fever in the dunes of Singapore."</t4905> <t4906>The room then became vulnerable to dust, heat, termites, red ants, and moths that would turn the wisdom of the books and parchments into sawdust.</t4906>
<t4907>There was always something to eat in the house.</t4907> <t4908>The day after Aureliano Segundo's death, one of the friends who had carried the crown with the irreverent inscription offered to pay Fernanda some money he had owed her husband.</t4908> <t4909>From then on, a messenger would bring a basket of food every Wednesday, which was enough for a week.</t4909> <t4910>No one ever knew that those provisions were sent by Petra Cotes, with the idea that continuous charity was a way to humiliate someone who had humiliated her.</t4910> <t4911>However, the resentment dissipated much sooner than she herself expected, and then she continued sending the food out of pride and finally out of compassion.</t4911> <t4912>Several times, when she lacked the spirit to sell lottery tickets and people lost interest in the raffles, she went without eating so that Fernanda could eat, and she did not stop fulfilling the commitment until she saw her funeral pass by.</t4912>
<t4913>For Santa Sofía de la Piedad, the reduction of the household inhabitants should have been the rest she deserved after more than half a century of work.</t4913><t4914>No one had ever heard a complaint from that stealthy, impenetrable woman, who sowed in the family the angelic seeds of Remedios, the beautiful, and the mysterious solemnity of José Arcadio Segundo; who dedicated an entire life of solitude and silence to raising children who barely remembered they were her children and grandchildren, and who took care of Aureliano as if he had come from her own womb, without knowing herself that she was his great-grandmother.</t4914><t4915>Only in a house like that was it conceivable that she had always slept on a mat she laid on the floor of the granary, amidst the nocturnal racket of the rats, without ever telling anyone that one night she was awakened by the terrifying sensation that someone was watching her in the dark, and it was a snake slithering over her belly.</t4915><t4916>She knew that if she had told Úrsula, she would have put her to sleep in her own bed, but those were the times when no one noticed anything unless it was shouted in the corridor, because the bakery chores, the war's upheavals, and the care of the children left no time to think about others' happiness.</t4916><t4917>Petra Cotes, whom she never saw, was the only one who remembered her.</t4917><t4918>She made sure she had a good pair of shoes to go out, that she never lacked a dress, even in times when she performed miracles with the raffle money.</t4918><t4919>When Fernanda arrived at the house, she had reasons to believe she was an eternal servant, and although she heard several times that she was her husband's mother, it seemed so incredible to her that she took longer to learn it than to forget it.</t4919><t4920>Santa Sofía de la Piedad never seemed bothered by that subordinate condition.</t4920><t4921>On the contrary, it seemed she liked to wander through the corners, without a break, without a complaint, keeping the immense house where she had lived since adolescence orderly and clean, and which particularly in the times of the banana company seemed more like a barracks than a home.</t4921><t4922>But when Úrsula died, the inhuman diligence of Santa Sofía de la Piedad, her tremendous capacity for work, began to falter.</t4922><t4923>It wasn't just that she was old and exhausted, but the house plunged overnight into a crisis of senility.</t4923><t4924>A tender moss climbed up the walls.</t4924><t4925>When there was no longer a bare spot in the patios, the weeds broke through the cement of the corridor from below, cracking it like glass, and the same little yellow flowers that Úrsula had found almost a century earlier in the glass where Melquíades' dentures were, emerged from the cracks.</t4925><t4926>Without time or resources to prevent nature's excesses, Santa Sofía de la Piedad spent the day in the bedrooms, scaring away the lizards that would come back in at night.</t4926><t4927>One morning she saw the red ants abandon the undermined foundations, cross the garden, climb up the handrail where the begonias had acquired a soil color, and enter the house's depths.</t4927><t4928>She first tried to kill them with a broom, then with insecticide, and finally with lime, but the next day they were back in the same place, always passing, tenacious and invincible.</t4928><t4929>Fernanda, writing letters to her children, did not notice the unstoppable onslaught of destruction.</t4929><t4930>Santa Sofía de la Piedad continued fighting alone, battling the weeds to keep them out of the kitchen, pulling the tassels of cobwebs off the walls that reproduced in a few hours, scraping off the termites.</t4930><t4931>But when she saw that even Melquíades' room was cobwebbed and dusty, despite sweeping and dusting it three times a day, and that despite her furious cleaning it was threatened by debris and the air of misery that only Colonel Aureliano Buendía and the young soldier had foreseen, she understood that she was defeated.</t4931><t4932>Then she put on the worn Sunday dress, some old shoes of Úrsula's, and a pair of cotton stockings that Amaranta Úrsula had given her, and made a little bundle with the two or three changes of clothes she had left.</t4932>
<t4933>—I give up —he said to Aureliano—.</t4933> <t4934>This house is too much for my poor bones.</t4934>
<t4935>Aureliano asked her where she was going, and she made a vague gesture, as if she had no idea of her destination.</t4935> <t4936>She tried to specify, however, that she was going to spend her last years with a first cousin who lived in Riohacha.</t4936> <t4937>It was not a plausible explanation.</t4937> <t4938>Since the death of her parents, she had not had contact with anyone in the town, nor received letters or messages, nor was she heard to speak of any relatives.</t4938> <t4939>Aureliano gave her fourteen little gold fishes, because she was ready to leave with the only thing she had: one peso and twenty-five cents.</t4939> <t4940>From the window of the room, he saw her cross the patio with her bundle of clothes, dragging her feet and bent by the years, and he saw her put her hand through a hole in the gate to place the latch after she had gone out.</t4940> <t4941>She was never heard from again.</t4941>
<t4942>When she learned of the escape, Fernanda ranted for an entire day, while she checked trunks, dressers, and wardrobes, item by item, to convince herself that Santa Sofía de la Piedad had not taken anything.</t4942><t4943>She burned her fingers trying to light a stove for the first time in her life, and had to ask Aureliano to do her the favor of teaching her how to make coffee.</t4943><t4944>Over time, it was he who took over the kitchen chores.</t4944><t4945>Upon waking up, Fernanda would find breakfast served, and she would only leave the bedroom to fetch the food that Aureliano left covered in the embers, which she would take to the table to eat on linen tablecloths and among candelabras, sitting at a solitary head of the table at the end of fifteen empty chairs.</t4945><t4946>Even in those circumstances, Aureliano and Fernanda did not share their solitude, but continued living each in their own, cleaning their respective rooms, while the cobwebs snowed over the rose bushes, covered the beams, and cushioned the walls.</t4946><t4947>It was around that time that Fernanda had the impression that the house was filling with goblins.</t4947><t4948>It was as if the objects, especially those of daily use, had developed the ability to move by themselves.</t4948><t4949>Fernanda spent her time looking for the scissors she was sure she had placed on the bed, and after turning everything upside down, she found them on a kitchen shelf, where she believed she hadn't been for four days.</t4949><t4950>Suddenly there wasn't a fork in the cutlery drawer, and she found six on the altar and three in the laundry room.</t4950><t4951>That wandering of things was more exasperating when she sat down to write.</t4951><t4952>The inkwell she placed on the right appeared on the left, the blotting paper pad got lost, and she found it two days later under the pillow, and the pages written to José Arcadio got mixed up with those of Amaranta Úrsula, and she was always worried about having put the letters in the wrong envelopes, which indeed happened several times.</t4952><t4953>On one occasion she lost the pen.</t4953><t4954>Fifteen days later, the postman returned it to her, having found it in his bag and going from house to house looking for the owner.</t4954><t4955>At first, she thought it was the work of the invisible doctors, like the disappearance of the pessaries, and even started writing them a letter to beg them to leave her in peace, but she had to interrupt it to do something, and when she returned to the room not only did she not find the started letter, but she also forgot the purpose of writing it.</t4955><t4956>For a while, she thought it was Aureliano.</t4956><t4957>She began to watch him, placing objects in his path trying to catch him in the act of moving them, but very soon she was convinced that Aureliano never left Melquíades' room except to go to the kitchen or the bathroom, and that he was not a man for pranks.</t4957><t4958>So she ended up believing that it was the mischief of goblins, and decided to secure each thing in the place where she had to use it.</t4958><t4959>She tied the scissors with a long string to the headboard of the bed.</t4959><t4960>She tied the duster and the blotting paper pad to the leg of the table, and glued the inkwell to the board, to the right of the place where she usually wrote.</t4960><t4961>The problems were not solved overnight, because after a few hours of sewing the string of the scissors was already too short to cut, as if the goblins were shortening it.</t4961><t4962>The same thing happened with the string of the pen, and even with her own arm, which after a short time of writing could not reach the inkwell.</t4962><t4963>Neither Amaranta Úrsula, in Brussels, nor José Arcadio, in Rome, ever learned of these insignificant misfortunes.</t4963><t4964>Fernanda told them that she was happy, and in reality, she was, precisely because she felt freed from all commitments, as if life had dragged her back to her parents' world, where daily problems were not suffered because they were solved in advance in the imagination.</t4964><t4965>That endless correspondence made her lose track of time, especially after Santa Sofía de la Piedad left.</t4965><t4966>She had gotten used to keeping track of the days, months, and years, taking as reference points the dates scheduled for the return of her children.</t4966><t4967>But when they changed the deadlines over and over again, the dates got confused, the terms got mixed up, and the days became so similar to each other that they were not felt to pass.</t4967><t4968>Instead of becoming impatient, she experienced a deep satisfaction with the delay.</t4968><t4969>She was not troubled that many years after announcing the eve of his perpetual vows, José Arcadio kept saying that he hoped to finish his studies in high theology to begin those in diplomacy, because she understood that the spiral staircase leading to the chair of Saint Peter was very high and paved with obstacles.</t4969><t4970>On the other hand, her spirit was exalted by news that for others would have been insignificant, such as that her son had seen the Pope.</t4970><t4971>She experienced similar joy when Amaranta Úrsula sent word that her studies were taking longer than expected because her excellent grades had earned her privileges that her father had not considered when making the calculations.</t4971>
<t4972>More than three years had passed since Santa Sofía de la Piedad brought him the grammar book, when Aureliano managed to translate the first sheet.</t4972><t4973>It was not a useless task, but it was merely a first step on a path whose length was impossible to foresee, because the text in Spanish meant nothing: they were encrypted verses.</t4973><t4974>Aureliano lacked the elements to establish the keys that would allow him to decipher them, but since Melquíades had told him that the books he needed to get to the bottom of the parchments were in the wise Catalan's shop, he decided to speak with Fernanda to ask her to let him go fetch them.</t4974><t4975>In the room devoured by debris, whose uncontrollable proliferation had ultimately defeated him, he thought about the most suitable way to make the request, anticipated the circumstances, calculated the most appropriate occasion, but when he found Fernanda removing the food from the embers, which was the only opportunity to talk to her, the laboriously premeditated request got stuck in his throat, and he lost his voice.</t4975><t4976>That was the only time he spied on her.</t4976><t4977>He was attentive to her steps in the bedroom.</t4977><t4978>He heard her go to the door to receive letters from her children and hand hers to the postman, and he listened until very late at night to the hard and passionate stroke of the pen on the paper, before hearing the switch click and the murmur of prayers in the darkness.</t4978><t4979>Only then did he fall asleep, trusting that the next day would give him the awaited opportunity.</t4979><t4980>He was so hopeful that the permission would not be denied that one morning he cut his hair, which was already reaching his shoulders, shaved his tangled beard, put on tight pants and a detachable-collar shirt that he didn't know from whom he had inherited, and waited in the kitchen for Fernanda to come for breakfast.</t4980><t4981>The woman who came was not the one of every day, with her head held high and her stony gait, but an old woman of supernatural beauty, with a yellowed ermine cape, a golden cardboard crown, and the languid demeanor of someone who has cried in secret.</t4981><t4982>In fact, since she found it in Aureliano Segundo's trunks, Fernanda had often worn the moth-eaten queen's dress.</t4982><t4983>Anyone who had seen her in front of the mirror, entranced by her own monarchical gestures, might have thought she was crazy.</t4983><t4984>But she wasn't.</t4984><t4985>She had simply turned the royal outfits into a memory machine.</t4985><t4986>The first time she put them on, she couldn't help but feel a lump in her heart and her eyes fill with tears, because at that moment she again perceived the smell of the boot polish of the soldier who came to her house to make her queen, and her soul crystallized with the nostalgia of lost dreams.</t4986><t4987>She felt so old, so finished, so distant from the best hours of her life, that she even longed for those she remembered as the worst, and only then did she discover how much she missed the wafts of oregano in the corridor, the steam of the rose bushes at dusk, and even the bestial nature of the upstarts.</t4987><t4988>Her heart of compacted ash, which had withstood the most accurate blows of daily reality without breaking, crumbled at the first onslaughts of nostalgia.</t4988><t4989>The need to feel sad was becoming a vice as the years devastated her.</t4989><t4990>She humanized in solitude.</t4990><t4991>However, the morning she entered the kitchen and found a cup of coffee offered by a bony and pale adolescent, with a hallucinatory glow in his eyes, she was torn by the sting of ridicule.</t4991><t4992>Not only did she deny him permission, but from then on she carried the house keys in the bag where she kept her unused pessaries.</t4992><t4993>It was a useless precaution, because if Aureliano had wanted to, he could have escaped and even returned home without being seen.</t4993><t4994>But the prolonged captivity, the uncertainty of the world, the habit of obedience, had dried up the seeds of rebellion in his heart.</t4994><t4995>So he returned to his seclusion, going over and over the parchments, and listening until very late at night to Fernanda's sobs in the bedroom.</t4995><t4996>One morning, as usual, he went to light the stove and found in the extinguished ashes the food he had left for her the previous day.</t4996><t4997>Then he peeked into the bedroom and saw her lying on the bed, covered with the ermine cape, more beautiful than ever, and with her skin turned into an ivory shell.</t4997><t4998>Four months later, when José Arcadio arrived, he found her intact.</t4998>
<t4999>It was impossible to conceive of a man more like his mother.</t4999> <t5000>He wore a mournful taffeta suit, a shirt with a round and stiff collar, and a thin silk ribbon with a bow, instead of a tie.</t5000> <t5001>He was pale, languid, with a bewildered look and weak lips.</t5001> <t5002>His black, glossy, and straight hair, parted in the middle of his skull by a straight and bloodless line, had the same artificial appearance as the hair of saints.</t5002> <t5003>The shadow of the well-trimmed beard on his paraffin face seemed a matter of conscience.</t5003> <t5004>He had pale hands, with green veins and parasitic fingers, and a solid gold ring with a round sunflower opal on his left index finger.</t5004> <t5005>When he opened the street door for him, Aureliano wouldn't have needed to guess who he was to realize he came from far away.</t5005> <t5006>The house was imbued with the fragrance of Florida water as he passed, which Úrsula used to pour on his head when he was a child, so she could find him in the dark.</t5006> <t5007>In some impossible-to-define way, after so many years of absence, José Arcadio was still an autumnal child, terribly sad and lonely.</t5007> <t5008>He went directly to his mother's bedroom, where Aureliano had vaporized mercury for four months in his great-great-grandfather's athanor, to preserve the body according to Melquíades' formula.</t5008> <t5009>José Arcadio didn't ask any questions.</t5009> <t5010>He kissed the corpse on the forehead, took from under her skirt the drawstring purse where there were three still unused pessaries, and the wardrobe key.</t5010> <t5011>He did everything with direct and decisive gestures, in contrast to his languor.</t5011> <t5012>He took from the wardrobe a damascened little chest with the family crest, and found inside the sandalwood-scented interior the voluminous letter in which Fernanda had poured out the countless truths she had hidden from him.</t5012> <t5013>He read it standing, eagerly but without anxiety, and on the third page he stopped, and examined Aureliano with a look of second recognition.</t5013>
<t5014>—So —he said with a voice that had something of a razor blade in it—, you are the bastard.</t5014>
<t5015>—I am Aureliano Buendía.</t5015>
<t5016>—Go to your room —said José Arcadio.</t5016>
<t5017>Aureliano left, and did not go out again even out of curiosity when he heard the rumor of the solitary funerals.</t5017> <t5018>Sometimes, from the kitchen, he saw José Arcadio wandering around the house, suffocating in his longing breath, and he continued to hear his steps through the ruined bedrooms after midnight.</t5018> <t5019>He did not hear his voice for many months, not only because José Arcadio did not speak to him, but because he had no desire for it to happen, nor time to think about anything other than the parchments.</t5019> <t5020>Upon Fernanda's death, he had taken out the penultimate little fish and had gone to the wise Catalonian's bookstore, in search of the books he needed.</t5020> <t5021>Nothing he saw on the way interested him, perhaps because he lacked memories for comparison, and the deserted streets and desolate houses were just as he had imagined them at a time when he would have given his soul to know them.</t5021> <t5022>He had granted himself the permission that Fernanda had denied him, and only once, with a single objective and for the minimum necessary time, so he walked without pause the eleven blocks that separated the house from the alley where dreams were once interpreted, and entered panting into the cluttered and gloomy place where there was barely space to move.</t5022> <t5023>More than a bookstore, it seemed like a dump of used books, placed in disorder on the shelves gnawed by termites, in the corners webbed with cobwebs, and even in the spaces that should have been intended for the passageways.</t5023> <t5024>On a long table, also burdened with tomes, the owner wrote an inexhaustible prose, with a purple, somewhat delirious handwriting, on loose sheets of school notebook paper.</t5024> <t5025>He had a beautiful silver mane that fell forward on his forehead like the crest of a cockatoo, and his blue, lively, narrow eyes revealed the meekness of a man who has read all the books.</t5025> <t5026>He was in his underwear, drenched in sweat, and did not stop writing to see who had arrived.</t5026> <t5027>Aureliano had no difficulty rescuing from that fabled disorder the five books he was looking for, as they were in the exact place Melquíades had indicated.</t5027> <t5028>Without saying a word, he handed them along with the little gold fish to the wise Catalonian, and he examined them, and his eyelids contracted like two clams.</t5028> <t5029>“You must be crazy,” he said in his language, shrugging, and returned the five books and the little fish to Aureliano.</t5029>
<t5030>—Take them away —he said in Spanish—.</t5030> <t5031>The last man who read those books must have been Isaac the Blind, so think carefully about what you're doing.</t5031>
<t5032>José Arcadio restored Meme's bedroom, had the velvet curtains and the damask of the viceroyal bed canopy cleaned and mended, and put the abandoned bathroom back into service, whose cement pool was blackened by a fibrous and rough scum.</t5032><t5033>His empire of trinkets, worn exotic fabrics, fake perfumes, and cheap jewelry was reduced to those two places.</t5033><t5034>The only thing that seemed to bother him in the rest of the house were the saints of the home altar, which he burned to ashes one afternoon in a bonfire he lit in the patio.</t5034><t5035>He slept until after eleven.</t5035><t5036>He went to the bathroom in a frayed tunic with golden dragons and slippers with yellow tassels, and there he performed a ritual that, due to its slowness and duration, reminded one of Remedios the Beautiful.</t5036><t5037>Before bathing, he scented the pool with salts he carried in three alabaster jars.</t5037><t5038>He did not perform ablutions with the totuma but instead immersed himself in the fragrant waters, staying for up to two hours floating on his back, lulled by the coolness and the memory of Amaranta.</t5038><t5039>A few days after arriving, he abandoned the taffeta dress, which besides being too hot for the town was the only one he had, and changed into tight pants, very similar to those Pietro Crespi wore in dance classes, and a silk shirt woven with live silk, with his initials embroidered over the heart.</t5039><t5040>Twice a week he washed the entire outfit in the pool and stayed in the tunic until it dried, as he had nothing else to wear.</t5040><t5041>He never ate at home.</t5041><t5042>He went out into the street when the heat of the siesta subsided, and did not return until late at night.</t5042><t5043>Then he continued his anguished wandering, breathing like a cat, and thinking of Amaranta.</t5043><t5044>She, and the dreadful gaze of the saints in the glow of the night lamp, were the two memories he kept of the house.</t5044><t5045>Many times, in the hallucinatory Roman August, he had opened his eyes in the middle of a dream and seen Amaranta emerging from a brocatelle marble pond, with her lace petticoats and her bandage in hand, idealized by the anxiety of exile.</t5045><t5046>Unlike Aureliano José, who tried to stifle that image in the bloody swamp of war, he tried to keep it alive in a mire of lust, while entertaining his mother with the endless tale of his pontifical vocation.</t5046><t5047>Neither he nor Fernanda ever thought that their correspondence was an exchange of fantasies.</t5047><t5048>José Arcadio, who left the seminary as soon as he arrived in Rome, continued to feed the legend of theology and canon law, so as not to jeopardize the fabulous inheritance his mother's delirious letters spoke of, which was to rescue him from the misery and squalor he shared with two friends in an attic in Trastevere.</t5048><t5049>When he received Fernanda's last letter, dictated by the premonition of imminent death, he packed the last remnants of his false splendor into a suitcase and crossed the ocean in a hold where emigrants were packed like slaughterhouse cattle, eating cold macaroni and wormy cheese.</t5049><t5050>Before reading Fernanda's will, which was nothing more than a meticulous and belated recapitulation of misfortunes, the dilapidated furniture and the weeds in the corridor had already indicated to him that he was trapped in a snare from which he would never escape, forever exiled from the diamond light and the timeless air of the Roman spring.</t5050><t5051>In the exhausting insomnias of asthma, he measured and remeasured the depth of his misfortune, while he reviewed the gloomy house where Úrsula's senile outbursts instilled in him the fear of the world.</t5051><t5052>To be sure not to lose him in the darkness, she had assigned him a corner of the bedroom, the only place where he could be safe from the dead who wandered the house from dusk.</t5052><t5053>"Any bad thing you do," Úrsula told him, "the saints will tell me."</t5053><t5054>The fearful nights of his childhood were reduced to that corner, where he remained motionless until bedtime, sweating with fear on a stool, under the watchful and icy gaze of the tattling saints.</t5054><t5055>It was a useless torture because by that time he was already terrified of everything around him and was prepared to be frightened by everything he encountered in life: the women of the street, who spoiled the blood; the women of the house, who bore children with pig tails; the fighting cocks, which caused men's deaths and lifelong remorse; the firearms, which condemned one to twenty years of war just by touching them; the ill-fated ventures, which only led to disappointment and madness, and everything, in short, everything that God had created with his infinite goodness, and that the devil had perverted.</t5055><t5056>Upon waking, worn out by the mill of nightmares, the clarity of the window and Amaranta's caresses in the pool, and the delight with which she powdered him between the legs with a silk acorn, freed him from terror.</t5056><t5057>Even Úrsula was different under the radiant light of the garden, because there she did not speak to him of fearful things, but rubbed his teeth with charcoal powder so that he would have the radiant smile of a Pope, and cut and polished his nails so that the pilgrims who came to Rome from all over the world would be amazed at the cleanliness of the Pope's hands when he blessed them, and combed him like a Pope, and soaked him with Florida water so that his body and clothes would have the fragrance of a Pope.</t5057><t5058>In the courtyard of Castelgandolfo, he had seen the Pope on a balcony, delivering the same speech in seven languages to a crowd of pilgrims, and the only thing that had indeed caught his attention was the whiteness of his hands, which seemed macerated in lye, the dazzling brightness of his summer clothes, and his hidden breath of cologne.</t5058>
<t5059>Almost a year after returning home, having sold the silver candlesticks and the heraldic chamber pot to eat, which in the end only had gold in the shield's inlays, José Arcadio's only distraction was gathering children from the town to play in the house.</t5059> <t5060>He would appear with them at siesta time, making them jump rope in the garden, sing in the corridor, and do acrobatics on the living room furniture, while he moved among the groups imparting lessons in good behavior.</t5060> <t5061>By that time, he had given up the tight pants and silk shirt, and wore an ordinary outfit bought from the Arab stores, but he still maintained his languid dignity and papal gestures.</t5061> <t5062>The children took over the house as Meme's companions had done in the past.</t5062> <t5063>Until late into the night, they could be heard chattering, singing, and dancing zapateados, so much so that the house seemed like an undisciplined boarding school.</t5063> <t5064>Aureliano did not worry about the invasion as long as they did not bother him in Melquíades' room.</t5064> <t5065>One morning, two children pushed open the door and were frightened by the sight of the filthy, hairy man who continued deciphering the parchments at the work table.</t5065> <t5066>They did not dare to enter, but they kept lurking around the room.</t5066> <t5067>They peeked through the cracks, threw live animals through the skylights, and on one occasion nailed shut the door and window from the outside, and Aureliano needed half a day to force them open.</t5067> <t5068>Amused by the impunity of their pranks, four children entered the room another morning while Aureliano was in the kitchen, ready to destroy the parchments.</t5068> <t5069>But as soon as they seized the yellowed sheets, an angelic force lifted them off the ground and kept them suspended in the air until Aureliano returned and snatched the parchments from them.</t5069> <t5070>From then on, they did not bother him again.</t5070>
<t5071>The four older children, who wore shorts despite already approaching adolescence, took care of José Arcadio's personal appearance.</t5071> <t5072>They arrived earlier than the others and spent the morning shaving him, giving him massages with hot towels, cutting and polishing his fingernails and toenails, and perfuming him with Florida water.</t5072> <t5073>On several occasions, they got into the pool to soap him from head to toe while he floated on his back, thinking of Amaranta.</t5073> <t5074>Then they dried him, powdered his body, and dressed him.</t5074> <t5075>One of the children, who had curly blonde hair and pink glassy eyes like a rabbit's, used to sleep in the house.</t5075> <t5076>The bonds that united him with José Arcadio were so strong that he accompanied him in his asthmatic insomnias, without speaking, wandering with him through the dark house.</t5076> <t5077>One night, they saw a yellow glow in the room where Úrsula slept, through the crystallized cement, as if an underground sun had turned the floor of the bedroom into stained glass.</t5077> <t5078>They did not need to turn on the light.</t5078> <t5079>It was enough for them to lift the broken slabs from the corner where Úrsula's bed had always been, and where the glow was most intense, to find the secret crypt that Aureliano Segundo had tired of searching for in his excavation delusions.</t5079> <t5080>There were the three canvas sacks closed with copper wire, and inside them, the seven thousand two hundred and fourteen four-doubloon coins, which continued to shine like embers in the darkness.</t5080>
<t5081>The discovery of the treasure was like a deflagration.</t5081><t5082>Instead of returning to Rome with the sudden fortune, which was the dream matured in misery, José Arcadio turned the house into a decadent paradise.</t5082><t5083>He replaced the curtains and the canopy of the bedroom with new velvet, and had the bathroom floor tiled and the walls covered with tiles.</t5083><t5084>The dining room cupboard was filled with candied fruits, hams, and pickles, and the disused granary was reopened to store wines and liquors that José Arcadio himself retrieved from the railway station in boxes marked with his name.</t5084><t5085>One night, he and the four older children threw a party that lasted until dawn.</t5085><t5086>At six in the morning, they came out of the bedroom naked, emptied the pool, and filled it with champagne.</t5086><t5087>They dove in flocks, swimming like birds flying in a golden sky of fragrant bubbles, while José Arcadio floated on his back, on the fringe of the party, evoking Amaranta with his eyes open.</t5087><t5088>He remained like that, absorbed, ruminating the bitterness of his equivocal pleasures, until after the children got tired and went in a rush to the bedroom, where they tore down the velvet curtains to dry themselves, shattered the rock crystal moon in the chaos, and dismantled the bed canopy trying to lie down in a tumult.</t5088><t5089>When José Arcadio returned from the bathroom, he found them sleeping huddled together, naked, in a wrecked bedroom.</t5089><t5090>Enraged not so much by the damage as by the disgust and pity he felt for himself in the desolate emptiness of the saturnalia, he armed himself with some ecclesiastical dog-whipping disciplines that he kept at the bottom of the trunk, along with a cilice and other instruments of mortification and penance, and expelled the children from the house, howling like a madman, and whipping them mercilessly, as he would not have done with a pack of coyotes.</t5090><t5091>He was left demolished, with an asthma attack that lasted for several days, giving him the appearance of a dying man.</t5091><t5092>On the third night of torture, overcome by suffocation, he went to Aureliano's room to ask him the favor of buying him some inhaling powders from a nearby pharmacy.</t5092><t5093>Thus, Aureliano made his second outing to the street.</t5093><t5094>He only had to walk two blocks to reach the narrow pharmacy with dusty glass cases and earthenware jars labeled in Latin, where a girl with the stealthy beauty of a Nile serpent dispensed the medication that José Arcadio had written on a piece of paper.</t5094><t5095>The second vision of the deserted town, barely lit by the yellowish street bulbs, did not awaken in Aureliano any more curiosity than the first time.</t5095><t5096>José Arcadio had thought he had fled, when he saw him reappear, a little breathless from the haste, dragging the legs that confinement and lack of mobility had made weak and clumsy.</t5096><t5097>His indifference to the world was so certain that a few days later José Arcadio broke the promise he had made to his mother and allowed him to go out whenever he wanted.</t5097>
<t5098>—I have nothing to do in the street —Aureliano replied to him.</t5098>
<t5099>He remained locked up, absorbed in the scrolls that he was gradually unraveling, but whose meaning, however, he could not interpret.</t5099> <t5100>José Arcadio brought him slices of ham, sugar-coated flowers that left a spring-like aftertaste in his mouth, and on two occasions a glass of good wine.</t5100> <t5101>He was not interested in the scrolls, which he considered more of an esoteric pastime, but he was struck by the rare wisdom and the inexplicable knowledge of the world that his desolate relative possessed.</t5101> <t5102>He then learned that he was capable of understanding written English, and that between scrolls he had read from the first page to the last, as if it were a novel, the six volumes of the encyclopedia.</t5102> <t5103>At first, he attributed Aureliano's ability to speak about Rome as if he had lived there for many years to this, but he soon realized that he had knowledge that was not encyclopedic, such as the prices of things.</t5103> <t5104>“Everything is known,” was the only response he received from Aureliano when he asked how he had obtained that information.</t5104> <t5105>Aureliano, for his part, was surprised that José Arcadio, seen up close, was so different from the image he had formed of him when he saw him wandering around the house.</t5105> <t5106>He was capable of laughing, of occasionally indulging in nostalgia for the house's past, and of being concerned about the atmosphere of misery in which Melquíades' room was found.</t5106> <t5107>That rapprochement between two solitary individuals of the same blood was far from friendship, but it allowed both of them to better endure the unfathomable solitude that at the same time separated and united them.</t5107> <t5108>José Arcadio could then turn to Aureliano to untangle certain domestic problems that exasperated him.</t5108> <t5109>Aureliano, in turn, could sit and read in the corridor, receive the letters from Amaranta Úrsula that continued to arrive with the same punctuality as always, and use the bathroom from which José Arcadio had banished him since his arrival.</t5109>
<t5110>On a hot early morning, both woke up alarmed by urgent knocks on the front door.</t5110> <t5111>It was a dark old man, with large green eyes that gave his face a spectral phosphorescence, and with a cross of ash on his forehead.</t5111> <t5112>The tattered clothes, the broken shoes, the old backpack he carried on his shoulder as his only luggage, gave him the appearance of a beggar, but his demeanor had a dignity that was in stark contradiction to his appearance.</t5112> <t5113>It was enough to see him once, even in the dim light of the room, to realize that the secret force that allowed him to live was not the instinct of self-preservation, but the habit of fear.</t5113> <t5114>He was Aureliano Amador, the only surviving son of Colonel Aureliano Buendía, who was seeking a truce in his long and eventful existence as a fugitive.</t5114> <t5115>He identified himself, begged them to give him refuge in that house which, in his nights as a pariah, he had evoked as the last bastion of security he had left in life.</t5115> <t5116>But José Arcadio and Aureliano did not remember him.</t5116> <t5117>Thinking he was a vagabond, they threw him out into the street with shoves.</t5117> <t5118>Both then saw from the door the end of a drama that had begun before José Arcadio had any sense of reason.</t5118> <t5119>Two police officers who had pursued Aureliano Amador for years, who had tracked him like dogs across half the world, emerged from among the almond trees on the opposite sidewalk and fired two Mauser shots that cleanly penetrated through the cross of ash.</t5119>
<t5120>In reality, ever since he had expelled the children from the house, José Arcadio had been waiting for news of a transatlantic ship that would depart for Naples before Christmas.</t5120> <t5121>He had told Aureliano, and had even made plans to leave him a business that would allow him to live, because the basket of provisions had not arrived since Fernanda's burial.</t5121> <t5122>However, that final dream was not to come true either.</t5122> <t5123>One morning in September, after having coffee with Aureliano in the kitchen, José Arcadio was finishing his daily bath when the four children he had expelled from the house burst through the gaps in the tiles.</t5123> <t5124>Without giving him time to defend himself, they jumped into the pool fully clothed, grabbed him by the hair, and held his head underwater until the bubbling of agony ceased on the surface, and his silent and pale dolphin-like body slid to the bottom of the fragrant waters.</t5124> <t5125>Then they took the three sacks of gold that only they and their victim knew where they were hidden.</t5125> <t5126>It was an action so quick, methodical, and brutal that it seemed like a military assault.</t5126> <t5127>Aureliano, locked in his room, did not notice anything.</t5127> <t5128>That afternoon, having missed him in the kitchen, he searched for José Arcadio throughout the house and found him floating in the perfumed mirrors of the pool, enormous and swollen, still thinking of Amaranta.</t5128> <t5129>Only then did he realize how much he had begun to love him.</t5129>
<t5130>Amaranta Úrsula returned with the first angels of December, pushed by sailing breezes, leading her husband tied by the neck with a silk cord.</t5130> <t5131>She appeared without any announcement, wearing an ivory-colored dress, a string of pearls that almost reached her knees, rings of emeralds and topazes, and her hair round and smooth, ending at her ears with swallow tips.</t5131> <t5132>The man she had married six months earlier was a mature, slender Flemish man with the air of a sailor.</t5132> <t5133>She only had to push the door of the living room to understand that her absence had been longer and more devastating than she had imagined.</t5133>
<t5134>—My God —she shouted, more cheerful than alarmed—, it’s so obvious there’s no woman in this house!</t5134>
<t5135>The luggage didn't fit in the corridor.</t5135> <t5136>In addition to Fernanda's old trunk that she was sent to school with, she brought two vertical wardrobes, four large suitcases, a bag for umbrellas, eight hat boxes, a gigantic cage with half a hundred canaries, and her husband's velocipede, disassembled inside a special case that allowed it to be carried like a cello.</t5136> <t5137>She didn't even allow herself a day of rest at the end of the long journey.</t5137> <t5138>She put on a worn canvas overall that her husband had brought along with other motorist clothes, and embarked on a new restoration of the house.</t5138> <t5139>She drove away the red ants that had already taken over the corridor, revived the rose bushes, uprooted the weeds, and replanted ferns, oregano, and begonias in the railing pots.</t5139> <t5140>She led a crew of carpenters, locksmiths, and masons who patched up the cracks in the floors, rehung doors and windows, renewed the furniture, and whitewashed the walls inside and out, so that three months after her arrival, the air of youth and festivity that existed in the days of the pianola was once again breathed.</t5140> <t5141>No one had ever been seen in the house with better humor at all times and in any circumstance, nor anyone more willing to sing and dance, and to throw away the stale things and customs.</t5141> <t5142>With a sweep of the broom, she got rid of the funeral memories and the piles of useless trinkets and superstitious devices that were piled up in the corners, and the only thing she kept, out of gratitude to Úrsula, was the daguerreotype of Remedios in the living room.</t5142> <t5143>"Look at this luxury," she shouted, laughing her head off.</t5143> <t5144>"A fourteen-year-old great-grandmother!"</t5144> <t5145>When one of the masons told her that the house was populated by ghosts, and that the only way to scare them away was to look for the treasures they had left buried, she replied with laughter that she didn't believe in men's superstitions.</t5145> <t5146>She was so spontaneous, so emancipated, with such a modern and free spirit, that Aureliano didn't know what to do with himself when he saw her arrive.</t5146> <t5147>"How amazing!" she shouted happily, with open arms.</t5147> <t5148>"Look how my beloved cannibal has grown!"</t5148> <t5149>Before he had time to react, she had already put a record on the portable gramophone she had brought with her, and was trying to teach him the latest dances.</t5149> <t5150>She made him change out of the scrawny pants he had inherited from Colonel Aureliano Buendía, gave him youthful shirts and two-tone shoes, and pushed him out into the street when he spent too much time in Melquíades' room.</t5150>
<t5151>Active, petite, indomitable like Úrsula, and almost as beautiful and provocative as Remedios the Beautiful, she was endowed with a rare instinct for anticipating fashion.</t5151> <t5152>When she received the latest fashion magazines by mail, they merely served to confirm that she had not made a mistake in the designs she invented and sewed on Amaranta's rudimentary hand-crank machine.</t5152> <t5153>She subscribed to every fashion, artistic information, and popular music magazine published in Europe, and she barely glanced at them to realize that things in the world were as she imagined them.</t5153> <t5154>It was not understandable that a woman with such a spirit had returned to a dead town, depressed by dust and heat, and even less with a husband who had more than enough money to live well anywhere in the world, and who loved her so much that he had submitted to being led around by her with a silk leash.</t5154> <t5155>However, as time passed, her intention to stay became more evident, as she did not conceive plans that were not long-term, nor did she make decisions that were not aimed at securing a comfortable life and a peaceful old age in Macondo.</t5155> <t5156>The canary cage demonstrated that these purposes were not improvised.</t5156> <t5157>Remembering that her mother had told her in a letter about the extermination of the birds, she delayed the trip several months until she found a ship that made a stopover in the Canary Islands, and there she selected the twenty-five finest pairs of canaries to repopulate the skies of Macondo.</t5157> <t5158>That was the most lamentable of her numerous frustrated initiatives.</t5158> <t5159>As the birds reproduced, Amaranta Úrsula released them in pairs, and they took longer to feel free than to flee the town.</t5159> <t5160>In vain did she try to endear them to the aviary that Úrsula had built in the first restoration.</t5160> <t5161>In vain did she make fake nests out of esparto grass in the almond trees, scatter birdseed on the roofs, and agitate the captives so that their songs would dissuade the deserters, because they soared at the first attempt and circled the sky, just long enough to find the way back to the Canary Islands.</t5161>
<t5162>A year after their return, even though she had not managed to make a friend or organize a party, Amaranta Úrsula still believed it was possible to rescue that community chosen by misfortune.</t5162> <t5163>Gastón, her husband, took care not to contradict her, although from the deadly noon when he got off the train, he understood that his wife's determination had been provoked by a mirage of nostalgia.</t5163> <t5164>Sure that she would be defeated by reality, he didn't even bother to assemble the velocipede, but instead pursued the most lucid eggs among the cobwebs that the builders dislodged, and he would open them with his nails and spend hours contemplating the tiny spiders that emerged from inside with a magnifying glass.</t5164> <t5165>Later, believing that Amaranta Úrsula continued with the renovations just to save face, he resolved to assemble the cumbersome velocipede whose front wheel was much larger than the rear one, and he dedicated himself to capturing and dissecting every native insect he found in the surroundings, which he sent in jam jars to his former natural history professor at the University of Liège, where he had done advanced studies in entomology, although his dominant vocation was that of an aeronaut.</t5165> <t5166>When he rode the velocipede, he wore acrobat pants, bagpiper socks, and a detective cap, but when he walked, he dressed in impeccable raw linen, with white shoes, a silk bow tie, a boater hat, and a wicker cane in hand.</t5166> <t5167>He had pale pupils that accentuated his air of a navigator, and a little squirrel-hair mustache.</t5167> <t5168>Although he was at least fifteen years older than his wife, his youthful tastes, his vigilant determination to make her happy, and his virtues as a good lover compensated for the difference.</t5168> <t5169>In reality, those who saw that cautious forty-year-old, with his fishing line around his neck and his circus bicycle, could not have imagined that he had an unrestrained love pact with his young wife, and that both gave in to mutual urgency in the least suitable places and wherever inspiration struck them, as they had done since they started seeing each other, with a passion that the passage of time and increasingly unusual circumstances deepened and enriched.</t5169> <t5170>Gastón was not only a fierce lover, with inexhaustible wisdom and imagination, but he was perhaps the first man in the history of the species to make an emergency landing and almost kill himself with his girlfriend just to make love in a field of violets.</t5170>
<t5171>They had met three years before getting married, when the sports biplane in which he performed stunts over the school where Amaranta Úrsula studied attempted a daring maneuver to avoid the flagpole, and the primitive framework of canvas and aluminum foil got caught by the tail in the electric power cables.</t5171><t5172>Since then, ignoring his splinted leg, he would go on weekends to pick up Amaranta Úrsula at the convent boarding house where she always lived, whose rules were not as strict as Fernanda would have liked, and he would take her to his sports club.</t5172><t5173>They began to love each other at 500 meters above ground, in the Sunday air of the moors, and they felt more connected the smaller the people on the ground became.</t5173><t5174>She spoke to him of Macondo as the brightest and most peaceful town in the world, and of a huge house, scented with oregano, where she wanted to live until old age with a loyal husband and two unruly sons named Rodrigo and Gonzalo, and in no case Aureliano and José Arcadio, and a daughter named Virginia, and in no case Remedios.</t5174><t5175>She had evoked with such longing tenacity the town idealized by nostalgia, that Gastón understood that she wouldn't want to marry unless he took her to live in Macondo.</t5175><t5176>He agreed, as he later did with the fishing line, because he thought it was a temporary whim that was better to disappoint in time.</t5176><t5177>But when two years had passed in Macondo and Amaranta Úrsula was still as happy as the first day, he began to show signs of alarm.</t5177><t5178>By then he had dissected every insect that could be dissected in the region, spoke Spanish like a native, and had solved all the crossword puzzles in the magazines they received by mail.</t5178><t5179>He didn't have the excuse of the climate to hasten their return, because nature had endowed him with a colonial liver, which withstood the afternoon heat and the water with larvae without any trouble.</t5179><t5180>He liked the local food so much that once he ate a string of eighty-two iguana eggs.</t5180><t5181>Amaranta Úrsula, on the other hand, had fish and seafood brought to her by train in ice boxes, canned meats, and candied fruits, which were the only things she could eat, and she continued to dress in European fashion and receive fashion magazines by mail, despite having nowhere to go and no one to visit, and despite the fact that by then her husband lacked the humor to appreciate her short dresses, tilted felt hats, and seven-strand necklaces.</t5181><t5182>Her secret seemed to be that she always found a way to stay busy, solving domestic problems she herself created and doing certain things poorly only to correct them the next day, with a pernicious diligence that would have made Fernanda think of the hereditary vice of doing to undo.</t5182><t5183>Her festive spirit remained so lively that when she received new records, she would invite Gastón to stay in the living room until very late to practice the dances her schoolmates described to her with drawings, and they usually ended up making love on the Viennese rocking chairs or on the bare floor.</t5183><t5184>The only thing missing for her to be completely happy was the birth of children, but she respected the pact she had made with her husband not to have them before being married for five years.</t5184>
<t5185>Looking for something to fill his idle hours, Gastón used to spend the morning in Melquíades' room, with the elusive Aureliano.</t5185> <t5186>He enjoyed recalling with him the most intimate corners of his homeland, which Aureliano knew as if he had been there for a long time.</t5186> <t5187>When Gastón asked him how he had obtained information that was not in the encyclopedia, he received the same answer that José Arcadio had: "Everything is known."</t5187> <t5188>In addition to Sanskrit, Aureliano had learned English and French, and some Latin and Greek.</t5188> <t5189>Since he went out every afternoon, and Amaranta Úrsula had assigned him a weekly allowance for his personal expenses, his room looked like a section of the wise Catalan's bookstore.</t5189> <t5190>He read voraciously until very late at night, although from the way he referred to his readings, Gastón thought that he did not buy the books to inform himself but to verify the accuracy of his knowledge, and that none interested him more than the parchments, to which he dedicated the best hours of the morning.</t5190> <t5191>Both Gastón and his wife would have liked to incorporate him into family life, but Aureliano was a hermetic man, with a cloud of mystery that time was making denser.</t5191> <t5192>It was such an insurmountable condition that Gastón failed in his efforts to become close to him, and had to find another pastime to fill his idle hours.</t5192> <t5193>It was around that time that he conceived the idea of establishing an airmail service.</t5193>
<t5194>It was not a new project.</t5194> <t5195>In fact, he had it quite advanced when he met Amaranta Úrsula, only it was not for Macondo but for the Belgian Congo, where his family had investments in palm oil.</t5195> <t5196>Marriage, the decision to spend a few months in Macondo to please his wife, had forced him to postpone it.</t5196> <t5197>But when he saw that Amaranta Úrsula was determined to organize a public improvement board and even laughed at him for suggesting the possibility of returning, he realized that things were going to take a long time, and he reestablished contact with his forgotten partners in Brussels, thinking that to be a pioneer it made no difference whether it was the Caribbean or Africa.</t5197> <t5198>While the negotiations progressed, he prepared a landing field in the former enchanted region that then seemed like a cracked flint plain, and studied the direction of the winds, the geography of the coastline, and the most suitable routes for air navigation, not knowing that his diligence, so similar to that of Mr. Herbert, was instilling in the town the dangerous suspicion that his purpose was not to plan itineraries but to plant bananas.</t5198> <t5199>Enthusiastic about an idea that after all could justify his permanent establishment in Macondo, he made several trips to the provincial capital, met with the authorities, and obtained licenses and signed exclusivity contracts.</t5199> <t5200>Meanwhile, he maintained correspondence with his partners in Brussels similar to Fernanda's with the invisible doctors, and finally convinced them to ship the first airplane under the care of an expert mechanic, who would assemble it at the nearest port and fly it to Macondo.</t5200> <t5201>A year after the first measurements and meteorological calculations, trusting in the repeated promises of his correspondents, he had acquired the habit of strolling through the streets, looking at the sky, attentive to the murmurs of the breeze, waiting for the airplane to appear.</t5201>
<t5202>Although she had not noticed it, the return of Amaranta Úrsula brought about a radical change in Aureliano's life.</t5202><t5203>After the death of José Arcadio, he had become a regular customer of the wise Catalan's bookstore.</t5203><t5204>Moreover, the freedom he then enjoyed and the time he had at his disposal awakened a certain curiosity about the town, which he got to know without amazement.</t5204><t5205>He wandered through the dusty and lonely streets, examining with a more scientific than human interest the interiors of the ruined houses, the metal meshes of the windows broken by rust and dying birds, and the inhabitants weighed down by memories.</t5205><t5206>He tried to reconstruct with his imagination the ravaged splendor of the old banana company town, whose dry pool was filled to the brim with rotting men's shoes and women's slippers, and in whose houses, dismantled by weeds, he found the skeleton of a German shepherd still tied to a ring with a steel chain, and a telephone that kept ringing, ringing, ringing, until he picked it up, understood what a distressed and distant woman was asking in English, and answered that yes, the strike was over, the three thousand dead had been thrown into the sea, the banana company had left, and Macondo had finally been at peace for many years.</t5206><t5207>Those wanderings led him to the prostrate tolerance district, where in other times bundles of bills were burned to liven up the cumbiamba, and which was then a maze of streets more afflicted and miserable than the others, with some red lights still on, and barren dance halls adorned with scraps of garlands, where the wan and fat widows of no one, the French great-grandmothers, and the Babylonian matriarchs continued to wait beside the victrolas.</t5207><t5208>Aureliano found no one who remembered his family, not even Colonel Aureliano Buendía, except for the oldest of the Antillean blacks, an old man whose cottony head gave him the appearance of a photographic negative, who kept singing the gloomy psalms of the evening on the porch of the house.</t5208><t5209>Aureliano conversed with him in the convoluted Papiamento he learned in a few weeks, and sometimes shared the rooster head broth prepared by the great-granddaughter, a large black woman with solid bones, mare-like hips, and melon-like breasts, and a round, perfect head, armored by a hard cap of wiry hair that looked like a medieval warrior's coif.</t5209><t5210>Her name was Nigromanta.</t5210><t5211>At that time, Aureliano lived by selling cutlery, candlesticks, and other trinkets from the house.</t5211><t5212>When he was penniless, which was most of the time, he managed to get the market stalls to give him the rooster heads they were going to throw in the trash, and he took them to Nigromanta to make soups enhanced with purslane and scented with mint.</t5212><t5213>When the great-grandfather died, Aureliano stopped frequenting the house, but he met Nigromanta under the dark almond trees in the square, captivating the few night owls with her wild animal whistles.</t5213><t5214>Many times he accompanied her, talking in Papiamento about rooster head soups and other delicacies of misery, and would have continued doing so if she had not made him realize that his company was driving away her clientele.</t5214><t5215>Although he sometimes felt tempted, and although Nigromanta herself would have considered it a natural culmination of their shared nostalgia, he did not sleep with her.</t5215><t5216>Thus, Aureliano was still a virgin when Amaranta Úrsula returned to Macondo and gave him a brotherly hug that left him breathless.</t5216><t5217>Every time he saw her, and even worse when she taught him the latest dances, he felt the same helplessness of sponges in his bones that troubled his great-great-grandfather when Pilar Ternera made excuses with cards in the granary.</t5217><t5218>Trying to quell the torment, he immersed himself more deeply in the parchments and avoided the innocent flattery of that aunt who poisoned his nights with effluvia of tribulation, but the more he avoided her, the more anxiously he awaited her gravelly laughter, her happy cat howls, and her songs of gratitude, agonizing with love at any hour and in the least expected places in the house.</t5218><t5219>One night, ten meters from his bed, in the silversmith's shop, the disordered-bellied spouses shattered the glass case and ended up making love in a pool of muriatic acid.</t5219><t5220>Aureliano not only couldn't sleep a minute, but he spent the next day feverish, sobbing with rage.</t5220><t5221>The arrival of the first night he waited for Nigromanta under the shadow of the almond trees seemed eternal, pierced by the icy needles of uncertainty, and clutching in his fist the peso with fifty cents he had asked from Amaranta Úrsula, not so much because he needed it, but to complicate her, debase her, and prostitute her in some way with his adventure.</t5221><t5222>Nigromanta took him to her room lit with superstitious candles, to her scissor bed with the canvas stained by bad loves, and to her body of a fierce, hardened, soulless bitch, who prepared to dispatch him as if he were a frightened child, and suddenly found herself with a man whose tremendous power demanded a seismic readjustment of her insides.</t5222>
<t5223>They became lovers.</t5223> <t5224>Aureliano spent the morning deciphering parchments, and at siesta time he would go to the soporific bedroom where Nigromanta awaited him to teach him first to move like worms, then like snails, and finally like crabs, until he had to leave her to seek out lost loves.</t5224> <t5225>Several weeks passed before Aureliano discovered that she had around her waist a band that seemed to be made of cello string, but was as hard as steel and had no end, because it had been born and grown with her.</t5225> <t5226>Almost always, between love-making sessions, they ate naked in bed, in the hallucinating heat and under the daytime stars that the rust was making appear on the zinc roof.</t5226> <t5227>It was the first time Nigromanta had a steady man, a full-time lover, as she herself said laughing to death, and she even began to have heart illusions when Aureliano confided to her his repressed passion for Amaranta Úrsula, which he had not managed to remedy with substitution, but which was increasingly twisting his insides as experience broadened the horizon of love.</t5227> <t5228>Then Nigromanta continued to receive him with the same warmth as always, but she made him pay for the services with such rigor that when Aureliano had no money, she would charge it to an account she kept not with numbers but with little lines she traced with her thumbnail behind the door.</t5228> <t5229>At dusk, while she stayed loitering in the shadows of the square, Aureliano would pass through the corridor like a stranger, barely greeting Amaranta Úrsula and Gastón who usually dined at that hour, and would lock himself in his room, unable to read or write, or even think, due to the anxiety caused by the laughter, the whispers, the preliminary frolicking, and then the explosions of agonizing happiness that filled the nights of the house.</t5229> <t5230>That was his life two years before Gastón began to wait for the airplane, and it remained the same the afternoon he went to the wise Catalan's bookstore and found four young men ranting, engrossed in a discussion about methods of killing cockroaches in the Middle Ages.</t5230> <t5231>The old bookseller, knowing Aureliano's fondness for books that only Bede the Venerable had read, urged him with a certain paternal malice to join the controversy, and he didn't even take a breath to explain that cockroaches, the oldest winged insect on earth, had already been the favorite victim of sandal strikes in the Old Testament, but as a species, they were definitively refractory to any method of extermination, from tomato slices with borax to flour with sugar, as their one thousand six hundred and three varieties had resisted the most remote, tenacious, and ruthless persecution that man had unleashed since his origins against any living being, including man himself, to the extent that just as the human race was attributed an instinct for reproduction, it should be attributed another more defined and pressing one, which was the instinct to kill cockroaches, and that if they had managed to escape human ferocity, it was because they had taken refuge in the darkness, where they became invulnerable due to man's congenital fear of the dark, but in turn became susceptible to the splendor of midday, so that already in the Middle Ages, currently, and for centuries to come, the only effective method to kill cockroaches was solar dazzling.</t5231>
<t5232>That encyclopedic fatalism was the beginning of a great friendship.</t5232> <t5233>Aureliano continued meeting every afternoon with the four debaters, who were named Álvaro, Germán, Alfonso, and Gabriel, the first and last friends he had in his life.</t5233> <t5234>For a man like him, entrenched in written reality, those stormy sessions that began in the bookstore at six in the evening and ended in the brothels at dawn were a revelation.</t5234> <t5235>It had not occurred to him until then that literature was the best toy ever invented to mock people, as Álvaro demonstrated on a night of revelry.</t5235> <t5236>Some time had to pass before Aureliano realized that so much arbitrariness originated from the example of the wise Catalan, for whom wisdom was not worth it unless it could be used to invent a new way of preparing chickpeas.</t5236>
<t5237>The afternoon when Aureliano lectured about cockroaches, the discussion ended at the house of the young girls who slept with men out of hunger, a sham brothel in the outskirts of Macondo.</t5237> <t5238>The owner was a smiling madam, tormented by the mania of opening and closing doors.</t5238> <t5239>Her eternal smile seemed provoked by the gullibility of the clients, who accepted as real an establishment that existed only in imagination, because there even tangible things were unreal: the furniture that fell apart when sat upon, the gutted victrola inside which a hen was incubating, the garden of paper flowers, the calendars from years before the arrival of the banana company, the pictures with lithographs cut out from magazines that were never published.</t5239> <t5240>Even the timid little prostitutes who came from the neighborhood when the owner informed them that clients had arrived were pure invention.</t5240> <t5241>They appeared without greeting, wearing the little flowered dresses from five years earlier, and took them off with the same innocence with which they had put them on, and in the paroxysm of love they exclaimed in astonishment what a shame, look how that roof is falling, and as soon as they received their fifty cents they spent it on a piece of bread and cheese sold to them by the owner, more smiling than ever, because only she knew that even that food was not real.</t5241> <t5242>Aureliano, whose world at that time began with Melquíades' parchments and ended in Nigromanta's bed, found in the imaginary little brothel a donkey's cure for shyness.</t5242> <t5243>At first, he couldn't get anywhere, in rooms where the owner would enter at the best moments of love and make all kinds of comments about the intimate charms of the protagonists.</t5243> <t5244>But over time he became so familiar with those mishaps of the world that one night more unhinged than the others he undressed in the reception room and walked through the house balancing a bottle of beer on his inconceivable manhood.</t5244> <t5245>It was he who set the trend for the extravagances that the owner celebrated with her eternal smile, without protesting, without believing in them, just like when Germán tried to burn down the house to prove it didn't exist, or when Alfonso twisted the parrot's neck and threw it into the pot where the chicken stew was beginning to boil.</t5245>
<t5246>Although Aureliano felt connected to the four friends by the same affection and solidarity, to the point that he thought of them as if they were one, he was closer to Gabriel than to the others.</t5246> <t5247>The bond was born the night he casually spoke of Colonel Aureliano Buendía, and Gabriel was the only one who did not believe he was mocking someone.</t5247> <t5248>Even the owner, who usually did not intervene in conversations, argued with the rabid passion of a midwife that Colonel Aureliano Buendía, of whom she had indeed heard at some point, was a character invented by the government as a pretext to kill liberals.</t5248> <t5249>Gabriel, on the other hand, did not doubt the reality of Colonel Aureliano Buendía, because he had been a comrade-in-arms and inseparable friend of his great-grandfather, Colonel Gerineldo Márquez.</t5249> <t5250>Those whims of memory were even more critical when talking about the massacre of the workers.</t5250> <t5251>Every time Aureliano touched on the subject, not only the owner but also some people older than her repudiated the tale of the workers cornered at the station, and the train of two hundred wagons loaded with dead, and even insisted on what had, after all, been established in judicial records and primary school textbooks: that the banana company had never existed.</t5251> <t5252>Thus, Aureliano and Gabriel were linked by a kind of complicity, founded on real events in which no one believed, and which had affected their lives to the point that both found themselves adrift in the wake of a finished world, of which only nostalgia remained.</t5252> <t5253>Gabriel slept wherever the hour surprised him.</t5253> <t5254>Aureliano accommodated him several times in the silver workshop, but he spent the nights awake, disturbed by the bustle of the dead who roamed the bedrooms until dawn.</t5254> <t5255>Later, he entrusted him to Nigromanta, who took him to her crowded little room when she was free, and marked the accounts with vertical lines behind the door, in the few spaces left by Aureliano's debts.</t5255>
<t5256>Despite his disordered life, the entire group tried to do something enduring, at the behest of the wise Catalan.</t5256> <t5257>It was he, with his experience as a former professor of classical literature and his repository of rare books, who had put them in a position to spend an entire night searching for the thirty-seventh dramatic situation, in a town where no one was interested or had the means to go beyond primary school.</t5257> <t5258>Fascinated by the discovery of friendship, dazed by the enchantments of a world that had been denied to him by Fernanda's pettiness, Aureliano abandoned the scrutiny of the parchments, precisely when they began to reveal themselves to him as predictions in coded verses.</t5258> <t5259>But the subsequent realization that there was enough time for everything without having to give up the brothels gave him the courage to return to Melquíades' room, determined not to falter in his endeavor until he discovered the final keys.</t5259> <t5260>That was during the days when Gastón began to await the airplane, and Amaranta Úrsula was so alone that one morning she appeared in the room.</t5260>
<t5261>—Hello, cannibal —he said to him—.</t5261> <t5262>Back in the cave again.</t5262>
<t5263>She was irresistible, with her invented dress, and one of the long necklaces made of shad vertebrae, which she herself crafted.</t5263> <t5264>She had given up the fishing line, convinced of her husband's fidelity, and for the first time since their return, she seemed to have a moment of leisure.</t5264> <t5265>Aureliano wouldn't have needed to see her to know she had arrived.</t5265> <t5266>She leaned on the worktable, so close and defenseless that Aureliano perceived the deep murmur of her bones, and she took an interest in the parchments.</t5266> <t5267>Trying to overcome his turmoil, he caught the voice that was escaping him, the life that was slipping away, the memory that was turning into a petrified polyp, and he spoke to her about the Levitical destiny of Sanskrit, the scientific possibility of seeing the future transparent in time as one sees the writing on the reverse of a paper against the light, the need to encrypt predictions so they wouldn't defeat themselves, and about Nostradamus' Centuries and the destruction of Cantabria announced by Saint Millán.</t5267> <t5268>Suddenly, without interrupting the conversation, driven by an impulse that had been dormant in him since his origins, Aureliano placed his hand over hers, believing that this final decision would put an end to his anxiety.</t5268> <t5269>However, she grabbed his index finger with the affectionate innocence with which she had done many times in childhood, and held it while he continued answering her questions.</t5269> <t5270>They remained like that, connected by an icy index finger that transmitted nothing in any direction, until she awoke from her momentary dream and slapped her forehead.</t5270> <t5271>"The ants!" she exclaimed.</t5271> <t5272>And then she forgot about the manuscripts, walked to the door with a dancing step, and from there blew Aureliano the same kiss with her fingertips that she had used to bid farewell to her father the afternoon she was sent to Brussels.</t5272>
<t5273>—You can explain it to me later —he said—.</t5273> <t5274>I had forgotten that today is the day to put lime in the ant holes.</t5274>
<t5275>She continued going to the room occasionally, when she had something to do in that area, and stayed there for a few minutes, while her husband continued scrutinizing the sky.</t5275> <t5276>Excited by that change, Aureliano then stayed to eat with the family, something he hadn't done since the first months of Amaranta Úrsula's return.</t5276> <t5277>Gastón liked it.</t5277> <t5278>In the after-dinner conversations, which usually lasted for more than an hour, he lamented that his partners were deceiving him.</t5278> <t5279>They had announced the shipment of the airplane on a ship that never arrived, and although his maritime agents insisted that it would never arrive because it was not listed among the Caribbean ships, his partners stubbornly maintained that the dispatch was correct, and even insinuated the possibility that Gastón was lying in his letters.</t5279> <t5280>The correspondence reached such a degree of mutual suspicion that Gastón chose to stop writing, and began to suggest the possibility of a quick trip to Brussels to clarify things and return with the airplane.</t5280> <t5281>However, the project vanished as soon as Amaranta Úrsula reiterated her decision not to leave Macondo even if she ended up without a husband.</t5281> <t5282>In the early days, Aureliano shared the widespread idea that Gastón was a fool on a velocipede, and that aroused a vague feeling of pity in him.</t5282> <t5283>Later, when he obtained deeper information about the nature of men in the brothels, he thought that Gastón's meekness originated from unbridled passion.</t5283> <t5284>But when he got to know him better and realized that his true character was in contradiction with his submissive behavior, he conceived the malicious suspicion that even the wait for the airplane was a farce.</t5284> <t5285>Then he thought that Gastón was not as foolish as he appeared, but on the contrary, a man of infinite constancy, skill, and patience, who had set out to defeat his wife through the weariness of eternal complacency, of never saying no to her, of simulating limitless conformity, letting her get entangled in her own web, until the day she could no longer bear the tedium of illusions within reach, and she herself would pack her bags to return to Europe.</t5285> <t5286>Aureliano's former pity transformed into virulent animosity.</t5286> <t5287>Gastón's system seemed so perverse to him, but at the same time so effective, that he dared to warn Amaranta Úrsula.</t5287> <t5288>However, she mocked his suspicion, without even glimpsing the heartbreaking load of love, uncertainty, and jealousy he carried inside.</t5288> <t5289>It had not occurred to her that she aroused in Aureliano something more than fraternal affection, until she pricked her finger trying to open a can of peaches, and he rushed to suck the blood with an avidity and devotion that made her skin crawl.</t5289>
<t5290>—Aureliano! —she laughed, uneasy—.</t5290> <t5291>You are too mischievous to be a good bat.</t5291>
<t5292>Then Aureliano overflowed.</t5292> <t5293>Giving orphaned kisses in the hollow of her wounded hand, he opened the most hidden passages of his heart, and pulled out an endless and macerated gut, the terrible parasitic animal he had incubated in martyrdom.</t5293> <t5294>He told her how he would get up at midnight to cry out of abandonment and rage into the intimate clothes she left drying in the bathroom.</t5294> <t5295>He told her with how much anxiety he asked Nigromanta to scream like a cat, and sob in his ear gastón gastón gastón, and with how much cunning he raided her perfume bottles to find it on the necks of the little girls who lay with him out of hunger.</t5295> <t5296>Frightened by the passion of that outpouring, Amaranta Úrsula began to close her fingers, contracting them like a mollusk, until her wounded hand, freed from all pain and any trace of mercy, turned into a knot of emeralds and topazes, and stony and insensitive bones.</t5296>
<t5297>—Brute! —he said, as if he were spitting—.</t5297> <t5298>I'm going to Belgium on the first ship that leaves.</t5298>
<t5299>Álvaro had arrived one of those afternoons at the wise Catalan's bookstore, loudly proclaiming his latest discovery: a zoological brothel.</t5299> <t5300>It was called The Golden Boy, and it was an immense open-air hall, where no fewer than two hundred curlews roamed freely, announcing the time with a deafening cackle.</t5300> <t5301>In the wire pens surrounding the dance floor, and among large Amazonian camellias, there were colorful herons, caimans fattened like pigs, twelve-rattled snakes, and a golden-shelled turtle that dived into a tiny artificial ocean.</t5301> <t5302>There was a large white dog, tame and pederast, which nevertheless served as a stud in exchange for food.</t5302> <t5303>The air had an innocent density, as if it had just been invented, and the beautiful mulatto women who waited hopelessly among bloody petals and outdated records, knew arts of love that man had left forgotten in the earthly paradise.</t5303> <t5304>The first night the group visited that greenhouse of illusions, the splendid and taciturn old woman who watched the entrance from a wicker rocker felt that time was returning to its primary springs, when among the five who arrived, she discovered a bony, sallow man with Tartar cheekbones, marked forever and from the beginning of the world by the smallpox of solitude.</t5304>
<t5305>—Oh —she sighed—, Aureliano!</t5305>
<t5306>He was seeing Colonel Aureliano Buendía again, as he saw him by the light of a lamp long before the wars, long before the desolation of glory and the exile of disenchantment, the remote dawn when he went to his bedroom to give the first order of his life: the order to be given love.</t5306> <t5307>It was Pilar Ternera.</t5307> <t5308>Years earlier, when she turned one hundred and forty-five, she had given up the pernicious habit of keeping track of her age, and continued living in the static and marginal time of memories, in a perfectly revealed and established future, beyond the futures disturbed by the lurking threats and insidious suppositions of the cards.</t5308>
<t5309>Since that night, Aureliano had taken refuge in the tenderness and compassionate understanding of the ignored great-great-grandmother.</t5309> <t5310>Sitting in the wicker rocker, she evoked the past, reconstructed the greatness and misfortune of the family and the ravaged splendor of Macondo, while Álvaro scared the alligators with his thunderous laughter, and Alfonso invented the gruesome story of the curlews that pecked out the eyes of four customers who misbehaved the previous week, and Gabriel was in the room of the pensive mulatto woman who did not charge for love with money, but with letters for a smuggler boyfriend who was imprisoned on the other side of the Orinoco, because the border guards had purged him and then sat him on a chamber pot that ended up full of shit with diamonds.</t5310> <t5311>That real brothel, with that maternal owner, was the world Aureliano had dreamed of in his prolonged captivity.</t5311> <t5312>He felt so good, so close to perfect companionship, that he did not think of another refuge the afternoon Amaranta Úrsula shattered his illusions.</t5312> <t5313>He went ready to unburden himself with words, for someone to untie the knots that oppressed his chest, but he only managed to release himself in a fluid, warm, and restorative cry, in the lap of Pilar Ternera.</t5313> <t5314>She let him finish, scratching his head with the tips of her fingers, and without him revealing that he was crying out of love, she immediately recognized the oldest cry in the history of man.</t5314>
<t5315>—Well, little one —he comforted him—: now tell me who it is.</t5315>
<t5316>When Aureliano told her, Pilar Ternera let out a deep laugh, the old expansive laugh that had ended up sounding like the cooing of doves.</t5316> <t5317>There was no mystery in the heart of a Buendía that was impenetrable to her, because a century of cards and experiences had taught her that the family’s history was a mechanism of irreparable repetitions, a revolving wheel that would have kept turning until eternity, if it weren't for the progressive and irremediable wear of the axis.</t5317>
<t5318>—Don't worry —she smiled—.</t5318> <t5319>Wherever she is now, she is waiting for you.</t5319>
<t5320>It was four-thirty in the afternoon when Amaranta Úrsula came out of the bathroom.</t5320> <t5321>Aureliano saw her pass by his room, wearing a gown with delicate folds and a towel wrapped around her head like a turban.</t5321> <t5322>He followed her almost on tiptoe, staggering from drunkenness, and entered the bridal bedroom just as she opened her gown and then closed it again in fright.</t5322> <t5323>She made a silent gesture towards the adjoining room, whose door was ajar, and where Aureliano knew Gastón was beginning to write a letter.</t5323>
<t5324>—Go away —he said without a voice.</t5324>
<t5325>Aureliano smiled, lifted her by the waist with both hands, like a pot of begonias, and threw her on the bed face up.</t5325><t5326>With a brutal yank, he stripped her of the bathrobe before she had time to prevent it, and he gazed into the abyss of a freshly washed nakedness that did not have a shade of skin, a streak of hair, or a hidden mole that he had not imagined in the darkness of other rooms.</t5326><t5327>Amaranta Úrsula defended herself sincerely, with the cunning of a wise woman, weaseling her slippery, flexible, and fragrant weasel-like body, while trying to dislocate his kidneys with her knees and scratch his face with her nails, but neither he nor she emitted a sigh that could not be mistaken for the breathing of someone contemplating the leisurely April twilight through the open window.</t5327><t5328>It was a fierce struggle, a battle to the death, which nevertheless seemed devoid of all violence, because it was made of distorted aggressions and spectral evasions, slow, cautious, solemn, so that between one and the other there was time for the petunias to bloom again and Gastón to forget his dreams of being an aeronaut in the neighboring room, as if they were two enemy lovers trying to reconcile at the bottom of a clear pond.</t5328><t5329>In the heat of the fierce and ceremonious struggle, Amaranta Úrsula realized that the meticulousness of their silence was so irrational that it could have aroused the suspicions of the neighboring husband much more than the warlike noises they were trying to avoid.</t5329><t5330>Then she began to laugh with her lips pressed together, without giving up the fight, but defending herself with false bites and gradually unwinding her body, until both became aware of being at the same time adversaries and accomplices, and the struggle degenerated into a conventional frolic and the aggressions turned into caresses.</t5330><t5331>Suddenly, almost playfully, like one more prank, Amaranta Úrsula neglected her defense, and when she tried to react, frightened by what she herself had made possible, it was already too late.</t5331><t5332>An enormous commotion immobilized her at her center of gravity, planted her in her place, and her defensive will was demolished by the irresistible anxiety to discover what the orange whistles and invisible balloons that awaited her on the other side of death were.</t5332><t5333>She barely had time to stretch out her hand and blindly search for the towel, and put a gag between her teeth, so that the cat-like screams that were already tearing her insides wouldn't escape.</t5333>
<t5334>Pilar Ternera died in the wicker rocking chair, on a festive night, watching over the entrance to her paradise.</t5334> <t5335>According to her last will, she was buried without a coffin, seated in the rocking chair that eight men lowered with ropes into a huge hole, dug in the center of the dance floor.</t5335> <t5336>The mulatto women dressed in black, pale from crying, improvised dark ceremonies while they removed their earrings, brooches, and rings, and threw them into the grave before it was sealed with a nameless and dateless tombstone and covered with a mound of Amazonian camellias.</t5336> <t5337>After poisoning the animals, they sealed doors and windows with bricks and mortar, and dispersed around the world with their wooden trunks, lined inside with images of saints, magazine clippings, and portraits of ephemeral, remote, and fantastic lovers, who defecated diamonds, or ate cannibals, or were crowned kings of cards on the high seas.</t5337>
<t5338>It was the end.</t5338><t5339>In the tomb of Pilar Ternera, among psalms and trinkets of prostitutes, the remains of the past were rotting, the few that remained after the wise Catalan finished off the bookstore and returned to the Mediterranean village where he was born, defeated by the nostalgia of a tenacious spring.</t5339><t5340>No one could have foreseen his decision.</t5340><t5341>He had arrived in Macondo during the splendor of the banana company, fleeing one of many wars, and had thought of nothing more practical than to set up that bookstore of incunabula and original editions in various languages, which casual customers browsed with suspicion, as if they were books from a garbage heap, while they waited their turn to have their dreams interpreted in the house across the street.</t5341><t5342>He spent half his life in the hot back room, scribbling his precious writing in violet ink on sheets he tore from school notebooks, without anyone knowing for sure what he was writing.</t5342><t5343>When Aureliano met him, he had two drawers full of those intricate pages that somehow made one think of Melquíades' parchments, and from then until he left, he had filled a third one, so it was reasonable to think that he had done nothing else during his stay in Macondo.</t5343><t5344>The only people he associated with were the four friends, to whom he traded books for spinning tops and kites, and made them read Seneca and Ovid while they were still in primary school.</t5344><t5345>He treated the classics with a homely familiarity, as if they had all been his roommates at some point, and he knew many things that simply should not be known, such as that Saint Augustine wore a woolen doublet under his habit that he did not take off for fourteen years, and that Arnaldo de Vilanova, the necromancer, became impotent as a child due to a scorpion bite.</t5345><t5346>His fervor for the written word was a weave of solemn respect and gossipy irreverence.</t5346><t5347>Not even his own manuscripts were safe from that duality.</t5347><t5348>Having learned Catalan to translate them, Alfonso stuffed a roll of pages into his pockets, which were always full of newspaper clippings and manuals of rare trades, and one night he lost them in the house of the girls who slept with men out of hunger.</t5348><t5349>When the wise old man found out, instead of making the feared scandal, he laughed and commented that this was the natural destiny of literature.</t5349><t5350>However, no human power was able to persuade him not to take the three drawers when he returned to his native village, and he unleashed Carthaginian curses against the railway inspectors who tried to send them as cargo, until he managed to keep them with him in the passenger car.</t5350><t5351>“The world will have completely gone to hell,” he said then, “the day men travel in first class and literature in the cargo car.”</t5351><t5352>That was the last thing he was heard to say.</t5352><t5353>He had spent a black week with the final preparations for the trip, because as the hour approached, his mood deteriorated, his intentions got mixed up, and the things he put in one place appeared in another, besieged by the same goblins that tormented Fernanda.</t5353>
<t5354>—Balls —he cursed—.</t5354> <t5355>I shit on the 27th canon of the London synod.</t5355>
<t5356>Germán and Aureliano took charge of him.</t5356> <t5357>They helped him like a child, pinned the tickets and immigration documents to his pockets with safety pins, made him a detailed list of what he had to do from the moment he left Macondo until he disembarked in Barcelona, but he still threw away a pair of pants with half of his money without realizing it.</t5357> <t5358>The day before the trip, after nailing the crates shut and packing the clothes in the same suitcase he had arrived with, he squinted his clam-like eyelids, pointed with a kind of profane blessing at the piles of books that had helped him endure the exile, and said to his friends:</t5358>
<t5359>—There, I leave you that crap!</t5359>
<t5360>Three months later, twenty-nine letters and more than fifty portraits were received in a large envelope, which had accumulated during his idle times at sea.</t5360> <t5361>Although he didn't date them, it was evident the order in which he had written the letters.</t5361> <t5362>In the first ones, he recounted with his usual humor the adventures of the voyage, the urge he had to throw the purser overboard for not allowing him to bring the three crates into the cabin, the lucid imbecility of a lady who was terrified of the number 13, not out of superstition but because it seemed to her an unfinished number, and the bet he won at the first dinner because he recognized in the onboard water the nocturnal beet flavor of the springs of Lérida.</t5362> <t5363>As the days went by, however, the reality onboard mattered less and less to him, and even the most recent and trivial events seemed worthy of nostalgia, because as the ship moved away, his memory grew sadder.</t5363> <t5364>That process of progressive nostalgization was also evident in the portraits.</t5364> <t5365>In the first ones, he seemed happy, with his invalid's shirt and his snowy lock of hair, in the sparkling October of the Caribbean.</t5365> <t5366>In the last ones, he was seen with a dark coat and a silk scarf, pale and taciturn from absence, on the deck of a ship of sorrow that began to sleepwalk through autumnal oceans.</t5366> <t5367>Germán and Aureliano replied to his letters.</t5367> <t5368>He wrote so many in the first months that they felt closer to him then than when he was in Macondo, and almost relieved their anger that he had left.</t5368> <t5369>At first, he sent word that everything remained the same, that in the house where he was born the pink conch was still there, that the dried herrings tasted the same on the tinder of bread, that the village waterfalls continued to perfume the air at dusk.</t5369> <t5370>They were once again the notebook pages stitched together with purple scribbles, in which he dedicated a special paragraph to each one.</t5370> <t5371>However, and although he himself didn't seem to notice it, those letters of recovery and encouragement gradually turned into pastorals of disenchantment.</t5371> <t5372>On winter nights, while the soup boiled in the fireplace, he longed for the warmth of his back room, the hum of the sun in the dusty almond trees, the whistle of the train in the drowsiness of the siesta, just as he longed in Macondo for the winter soup in the fireplace, the cries of the coffee vendor, and the fleeting larks of spring.</t5372> <t5373>Dazed by two nostalgias facing each other like two mirrors, he lost his marvelous sense of unreality, until he ended up recommending to everyone that they leave Macondo, forget everything he had taught them about the world and the human heart, curse Horace, and remember always, wherever they were, that the past was a lie, that memory had no paths back, that every old spring was irretrievable, and that the most reckless and tenacious love was nonetheless an ephemeral truth.</t5373>
<t5374>Álvaro was the first to heed the advice to leave Macondo.</t5374> <t5375>He sold everything, even the captive tiger that mocked passersby in his yard, and bought an eternal ticket on a train that never stopped traveling.</t5375> <t5376>In the postcards he sent from the intermediate stations, he described in shouts the instant images he had seen through the window of the carriage, and it was like tearing apart and throwing into oblivion the long poem of transience: the chimeric blacks in the cotton fields of Louisiana, the winged horses in the bluegrass of Kentucky, the Greek lovers in the infernal twilight of Arizona, the girl in the red sweater painting watercolors by the lakes of Michigan, who waved goodbye with her brushes, a farewell that was not of parting but of hope, because she did not know she was watching a train with no return pass by.</t5376> <t5377>Then Alfonso and Germán left, on a Saturday, with the idea of returning on Monday, and they were never heard from again.</t5377> <t5378>A year after the departure of the wise Catalan, the only one left in Macondo was Gabriel, still adrift, at the mercy of Nigromanta's capricious charity, and answering the questionnaires of a French magazine contest, whose grand prize was a trip to Paris.</t5378> <t5379>Aureliano, who was the one receiving the subscription, helped him fill out the forms, sometimes at his house, and almost always among the porcelain jars and the valerian-scented air of the only pharmacy left in Macondo, where Mercedes, Gabriel's silent girlfriend, lived.</t5379> <t5380>It was the last remnant of a past whose annihilation was never consummated, because it continued to annihilate itself indefinitely, consuming itself from within, ending every minute but never completely ending.</t5380> <t5381>The town had reached such extremes of inactivity that when Gabriel won the contest and left for Paris with two changes of clothes, a pair of shoes, and the complete works of Rabelais, he had to signal the engineer to stop the train to pick him up.</t5381> <t5382>The old Street of the Turks was then a corner of abandonment, where the last Arabs allowed themselves to be carried towards death by the millennial habit of sitting at the door, even though they had sold the last yard of diagonal many years ago, and in the shadowy showcases, only decapitated mannequins remained.</t5382> <t5383>The city of the banana company, which Patricia Brown might have tried to evoke for her grandchildren on nights of intolerance and pickles in Prattville, Alabama, was a plain of wild grass.</t5383> <t5384>The elderly priest who had replaced Father Ángel, and whose name no one bothered to learn, awaited God's mercy lying idly in a hammock, tormented by arthritis and the insomnia of doubt, while lizards and rats fought over the inheritance of the neighboring temple.</t5384> <t5385>In that Macondo forgotten even by the birds, where the dust and heat had become so tenacious that it was hard to breathe, secluded by solitude and love and by the solitude of love in a house where it was almost impossible to sleep due to the noise of the red ants, Aureliano and Amaranta Úrsula were the only happy beings, and the happiest on earth.</t5385>
<t5386>Gastón had returned to Brussels.</t5386> <t5387>Tired of waiting for the airplane, one day he packed the essential things and his correspondence archive into a small suitcase and left with the intention of returning by air, before his privileges were ceded to a group of German aviators who had presented the provincial authorities with a more ambitious project than his.</t5387> <t5388>Since the afternoon of their first love, Aureliano and Amaranta Úrsula had continued to take advantage of the husband's rare moments of carelessness, loving each other with restrained ardor in random encounters almost always interrupted by unexpected returns.</t5388> <t5389>But when they found themselves alone in the house, they succumbed to the delirium of their overdue love.</t5389> <t5390>It was an insane, unhinging passion that made Fernanda's bones tremble with terror in her grave and kept them in a state of perpetual exaltation.</t5390> <t5391>Amaranta Úrsula's screams, her agonizing songs, erupted just the same at two in the afternoon at the dining table as at two in the morning in the barn.</t5391> <t5392>"What hurts me the most," she laughed, "is all the time we lost."</t5392> <t5393>In the daze of passion, he saw the ants devastating the garden, satisfying their prehistoric hunger on the house's wood, and he saw the torrent of live lava taking over the corridor again, but he only worried about fighting it when he found it in his bedroom.</t5393> <t5394>Aureliano abandoned the parchments, did not leave the house again, and answered the Catalan scholar's letters any which way.</t5394> <t5395>They lost their sense of reality, their notion of time, the rhythm of daily habits.</t5395> <t5396>They closed doors and windows again to avoid delays in undressing, and roamed the house as Remedios the Beauty had always wanted to be, and they rolled naked in the mud pits of the patio, and one afternoon they almost drowned while making love in the pool.</t5396> <t5397>In a short time, they caused more havoc than the red ants: they destroyed the living room furniture, tore apart the hammock that had withstood the sad camp loves of Colonel Aureliano Buendía, and ripped open the mattresses and emptied them on the floors to suffocate in storms of cotton.</t5397> <t5398>Although Aureliano was as fierce a lover as his rival, it was Amaranta Úrsula who commanded that paradise of disasters with her wild ingenuity and lyrical voracity, as if she had concentrated in love the indomitable energy that her great-great-grandmother had devoted to making little caramel animals.</t5398> <t5399>Moreover, while she sang with pleasure and laughed herself to death at her own inventions, Aureliano became more absorbed and silent, because his passion was introspective and scorching.</t5399> <t5400>However, both reached such extremes of virtuosity that when they were exhausted in exaltation, they made better use of their fatigue.</t5400> <t5401>They devoted themselves to the idolatry of their bodies, discovering that the tediums of love had unexplored possibilities, much richer than those of desire.</t5401> <t5402>While he kneaded Amaranta Úrsula's erect breasts with egg whites or softened her elastic thighs and peachy belly with coconut butter, she played dolls with Aureliano's prodigious creature, painting clown eyes with lip rouge and Turkish mustaches with eyebrow charcoal, and dressing it in organza bow ties and little silver paper hats.</t5402> <t5403>One night they smeared themselves from head to toe with peaches in syrup, licked each other like dogs, and made love like mad on the corridor floor, only to be awakened by a torrent of carnivorous ants preparing to devour them alive.</t5403>
<t5404>In the pauses of delirium, Amaranta Úrsula answered Gastón's letters.</t5404> <t5405>She felt him so distant and busy that his return seemed impossible to her.</t5405> <t5406>In one of the first letters, he mentioned that, in fact, his partners had sent the airplane, but a maritime agency in Brussels had mistakenly shipped it to Tanganyika, where it was delivered to the scattered Makondo community.</t5406> <t5407>That confusion caused so many setbacks that just recovering the airplane could take two years.</t5407> <t5408>So Amaranta Úrsula dismissed the possibility of an untimely return.</t5408> <t5409>Aureliano, for his part, had no more contact with the world than the letters from the wise Catalan and the news he received from Gabriel through Mercedes, the silent pharmacist.</t5409> <t5410>At first, they were real contacts.</t5410> <t5411>Gabriel had reimbursed his return ticket to stay in Paris, selling old newspapers and empty bottles that the maids took out from a gloomy hotel on Dauphine Street.</t5411> <t5412>Aureliano could then imagine him with a high-necked sweater that he only took off when the terraces of Montparnasse filled with spring lovers, sleeping by day and writing by night to confuse hunger, in the room smelling of boiled cauliflower foam where Rocamadour was to die.</t5412> <t5413>However, his news gradually became so uncertain, and the wise man's letters so sporadic and melancholic, that Aureliano got used to thinking of them as Amaranta Úrsula thought of her husband, and both ended up floating in an empty universe, where the only daily and eternal reality was love.</t5413>
<t5414>Suddenly, like a blast in that world of blissful unconsciousness, came the news of Gastón's return.</t5414> <t5415>Aureliano and Amaranta Úrsula opened their eyes, probed their souls, looked each other in the face with their hands on their hearts, and understood that they were so identified with each other that they preferred death to separation.</t5415> <t5416>Then she wrote her husband a letter of contradictory truths, in which she reiterated her love and her longing to see him again, while at the same time admitting as a fatal design the impossibility of living without Aureliano.</t5416> <t5417>Contrary to what both expected, Gastón sent them a calm, almost paternal response, with two whole pages devoted to warning them against the whims of passion, and a final paragraph with unequivocal wishes for them to be as happy as he had been in his brief marital experience.</t5417> <t5418>It was such an unexpected attitude that Amaranta Úrsula felt humiliated at the thought of having provided her husband with the pretext he desired to abandon her to her fate.</t5418> <t5419>Her resentment worsened six months later, when Gastón wrote to her again from Leopoldville, where he had finally received the airplane, only to ask that they send him the velocipede, which of all the things he had left in Macondo was the only one that had sentimental value for him.</t5419> <t5420>Aureliano patiently endured Amaranta Úrsula's bitterness, strove to show her that he could be as good a husband in prosperity as in adversity, and the daily urgencies that beset them when Gastón's last money ran out created between them a bond of solidarity that was not as dazzling and intoxicating as passion, but which served them to love each other as much and be as happy as in the tumultuous times of lust.</t5420> <t5421>When Pilar Ternera died, they were expecting a child.</t5421>
<t5422>In the stupor of pregnancy, Amaranta Úrsula tried to establish an industry of necklaces made from fish vertebrae.</t5422> <t5423>But except for Mercedes, who bought a dozen from her, she couldn't find anyone to sell them to.</t5423> <t5424>Aureliano became aware for the first time that his gift of tongues, his encyclopedic wisdom, his rare ability to remember without knowing the details of remote events and places, were as useless as his wife's chest of genuine jewelry, which at that time must have been worth as much as all the money that the last inhabitants of Macondo could have gathered together.</t5424> <t5425>They survived by a miracle.</t5425> <t5426>Although Amaranta Úrsula did not lose her good humor, nor her wit for erotic pranks, she acquired the habit of sitting in the corridor after lunch, in a kind of sleepless and pensive siesta.</t5426> <t5427>Aureliano accompanied her.</t5427> <t5428>Sometimes they remained silent until nightfall, facing each other, looking into each other's eyes, loving each other in the calm with as much love as they had once loved each other in the scandal.</t5428> <t5429>The uncertainty of the future made them turn their hearts towards the past.</t5429> <t5430>They saw themselves in the lost paradise of the deluge, splashing in the swamps of the yard, killing lizards to hang them on Úrsula, playing at burying her alive, and those recollections revealed to them the truth that they had been happy together since they could remember.</t5430> <t5431>Delving into the past, Amaranta Úrsula remembered the afternoon she entered the silver workshop and her mother told her that little Aureliano was nobody's child because he had been found floating in a basket.</t5431> <t5432>Although the version seemed implausible to them, they lacked the information to replace it with the true one.</t5432> <t5433>The only thing they were sure of, after examining all the possibilities, was that Fernanda was not Aureliano's mother.</t5433> <t5434>Amaranta Úrsula leaned towards believing that he was the son of Petra Cotes, of whom she only remembered fables of infamy, and that supposition produced a twist of horror in their souls.</t5434>
<t5435>Tormented by the certainty that he was his wife's brother, Aureliano made a quick trip to the parish house to search in the musty, moth-eaten archives for some definite clue about his parentage.</t5435> <t5436>The oldest baptismal record he found was that of Amaranta Buendía, baptized in her adolescence by Father Nicanor Reyna, around the time when he was trying to prove the existence of God through chocolate tricks.</t5436> <t5437>He began to entertain the possibility of being one of the seventeen Aurelianos, whose birth records he traced through four volumes, but the baptism dates were too remote for his age.</t5437> <t5438>Seeing him lost in blood labyrinths, trembling with uncertainty, the arthritic parish priest who was observing him from the hammock asked him compassionately what his name was.</t5438>
<t5439>—Aureliano Buendía —he said.</t5439>
<t5440>—Then don't kill yourself looking —exclaimed the priest with a decisive conviction—.</t5440> <t5441>Many years ago, there was a street here called that, and back then, people had the custom of naming their children after streets.</t5441>
<t5442>Aureliano trembled with rage.</t5442>
<t5443>—Ah! —he said—, so you don't believe either.</t5443>
<t5444>—In what?</t5444>
<t5445>—That Colonel Aureliano Buendía fought thirty-two civil wars and lost them all —replied Aureliano—.</t5445> <t5446>That the army cornered and machine-gunned three thousand workers, and that they took the bodies to throw them into the sea in a train of two hundred cars.</t5446>
<t5447>The parish priest measured him with a look of pity.</t5447>
<t5448>—Oh, son —she sighed—.</t5448> <t5449>It would be enough for me to be sure that you and I exist at this moment.</t5449>
<t5450>So Aureliano and Amaranta Úrsula accepted the story of the basket, not because they believed it, but because it saved them from their fears.</t5450> <t5451>As the pregnancy progressed, they became a single being, increasingly integrating into the solitude of a house that only needed one last breath to collapse.</t5451> <t5452>They had reduced themselves to an essential space, from Fernanda's bedroom, where they glimpsed the charms of sedentary love, to the beginning of the corridor, where Amaranta Úrsula sat knitting booties and newborn hats, and Aureliano answered the occasional letters from the wise Catalan.</t5452> <t5453>The rest of the house surrendered to the tenacious siege of destruction.</t5453> <t5454>The silver workshop, Melquíades' room, the primitive and silent realms of Santa Sofía de la Piedad remained at the back of a domestic jungle that no one would have dared to unravel.</t5454> <t5455>Surrounded by the voracity of nature, Aureliano and Amaranta Úrsula continued to cultivate oregano and begonias and defended their world with lime demarcations, building the last trenches of the immemorial war between man and ants.</t5455> <t5456>The long and neglected hair, the bruises that appeared on her face, the swelling of her legs, the deformation of her former and loving weasel-like body, had changed Amaranta Úrsula's youthful appearance from when she arrived at the house with the cage of unfortunate canaries and the captive husband, but they did not alter the vivacity of her spirit.</t5456> <t5457>“Shit,” she used to laugh.</t5457> <t5458>“Who would have thought that we would really end up living like cannibals!”</t5458> <t5459>The last thread that linked them to the world broke in the sixth month of pregnancy, when they received a letter that was evidently not from the wise Catalan.</t5459> <t5460>It had been postmarked in Barcelona, but the cover was written in conventional blue ink by an administrative handwriting, and it had the innocent and impersonal appearance of enemy messages.</t5460> <t5461>Aureliano snatched it from Amaranta Úrsula's hands as she was about to open it.</t5461>
<t5462>—Not this one —he told her—.</t5462> <t5463>I don't want to know what it says.</t5463>
<t5464>Just as he had sensed, the wise Catalan did not write again.</t5464> <t5465>The foreign letter, which no one read, was left at the mercy of the moths on the shelf where Fernanda once forgot her wedding ring, and there it continued to consume itself in the inner fire of its bad news, while the solitary lovers navigated against the current of those times of final days, impenitent and ominous times, which wore themselves out in the futile effort to make them drift towards the desert of disenchantment and oblivion.</t5465> <t5466>Aware of that threat, Aureliano and Amaranta Úrsula spent the last months holding hands, ending with loyal love the child begun with fornication excesses.</t5466> <t5467>At night, embraced in bed, they were not intimidated by the sublunar explosions of the ants, nor the roar of the moths, nor the constant and clear whistle of the weeds growing in the neighboring rooms.</t5467> <t5468>Many times they were awakened by the bustle of the dead.</t5468> <t5469>They heard Úrsula fighting with the laws of creation to preserve the lineage, and José Arcadio Buendía searching for the chimerical truth of great inventions, and Fernanda praying, and Colonel Aureliano Buendía dulling himself with the deceptions of wars and little gold fishes, and Aureliano Segundo agonizing in solitude amidst the daze of parties, and then they learned that the dominant obsessions prevail against death, and they became happy again with the certainty that they would continue to love each other with their ghostly natures, long after other species of future animals would snatch from the insects the paradise of misery that the insects were finishing snatching from men.</t5469>
<t5470>One Sunday, at six in the evening, Amaranta Úrsula felt the pangs of childbirth.</t5470> <t5471>The smiling midwife of the young girls who slept with men out of hunger made her climb onto the dining table, straddled her belly, and mistreated her with rough gallops until her screams were silenced by the cries of a formidable boy.</t5471> <t5472>Through her tears, Amaranta Úrsula saw that he was a great Buendía, solid and willful like the José Arcadios, with the open and clairvoyant eyes of the Aurelianos, and predisposed to start the lineage again from the beginning and purify it of its pernicious vices and solitary vocation, because he was the only one in a century who had been conceived with love.</t5472>
<t5473>—He is quite a cannibal —he said—.</t5473> <t5474>He will be called Rodrigo.</t5474>
<t5475>—No —her husband contradicted her—.</t5475> <t5476>He will be named Aureliano and will win thirty-two wars.</t5476>
<t5477>After cutting his umbilical cord, the midwife began to wipe off the blue ointment that covered his body with a cloth, illuminated by Aureliano with a lamp.</t5477> <t5478>Only when they turned him face down did they realize that he had something more than the rest of the men, and they leaned in to examine it.</t5478> <t5479>It was a pig's tail.</t5479>
<t5480>They were not alarmed.</t5480> <t5481>Aureliano and Amaranta Úrsula did not know the family precedent, nor did they remember Úrsula's dreadful admonitions, and the midwife reassured them with the supposition that the useless tail could be cut off when the child changed teeth.</t5481> <t5482>Then they had no chance to think about it again, because Amaranta Úrsula was bleeding uncontrollably.</t5482> <t5483>They tried to help her with spider web dressings and ash compresses, but it was like trying to stop a fountain with their hands.</t5483> <t5484>In the early hours, she made efforts to keep her good humor.</t5484> <t5485>She held the hand of the frightened Aureliano and begged him not to worry, saying that people like her were not made to die against their will, and she burst out laughing at the midwife's gruesome remedies.</t5485> <t5486>But as Aureliano's hopes faded, she became less visible, as if she were being erased from the light, until she sank into a stupor.</t5486> <t5487>At dawn on Monday, they brought a woman who prayed cauterizing prayers by her bedside, infallible for men and animals, but Amaranta Úrsula's passionate blood was insensitive to any artifice other than love.</t5487> <t5488>In the afternoon, after twenty-four hours of despair, they knew she was dead because the flow stopped without assistance, her profile sharpened, the welts on her face vanished into an alabaster dawn, and she smiled again.</t5488>
<t5489>Aureliano did not realize until then how much he loved his friends, how much he missed them, and how much he would have given to be with them at that moment.</t5489> <t5490>He placed the child in the basket that his mother had prepared for him, covered the face of the corpse with a blanket, and wandered aimlessly through the deserted town, searching for a passage back to the past.</t5490> <t5491>He knocked on the door of the pharmacy, where he had not been in recent times, and what he found was a carpentry workshop.</t5491> <t5492>The old woman who opened the door with a lamp in her hand took pity on his delirium and insisted that no, there had never been a pharmacy there, nor had she ever known a woman with a slender neck and sleepy eyes named Mercedes.</t5492> <t5493>He cried with his forehead pressed against the door of the old bookstore of the wise Catalan, aware that he was paying for the overdue tears of a death he did not want to mourn in time so as not to break the spells of love.</t5493> <t5494>He broke his fists against the mortar walls of El Niño de Oro, clamoring for Pilar Ternera, indifferent to the luminous orange discs that crossed the sky, which he had so often watched with childish fascination on festive nights from the courtyard of the curlews.</t5494> <t5495>In the last open hall of the dismantled tolerance neighborhood, an accordion ensemble played the songs of Rafael Escalona, the bishop's nephew, heir to the secrets of Francisco the Man.</t5495> <t5496>The bartender, who had a dry and seemingly charred arm from raising it against his mother, invited Aureliano to share a bottle of aguardiente, and Aureliano invited him to another.</t5496> <t5497>The bartender spoke to him about the misfortune of his arm.</t5497> <t5498>Aureliano spoke to him about the misfortune of his heart, dry and seemingly charred from raising it against his sister.</t5498> <t5499>They ended up crying together, and for a moment, Aureliano felt that the pain had ended.</t5499> <t5500>But when he was alone again in the last dawn of Macondo, he spread his arms in the middle of the plaza, ready to wake up the whole world, and shouted with all his soul:</t5500>
<t5501>—Friends are sons of bitches!</t5501>
<t5502>Nigromanta rescued him from a puddle of vomit and tears.</t5502> <t5503>She took him to his room, cleaned him up, and made him drink a cup of broth.</t5503> <t5504>Believing that this would console him, she crossed out with a charcoal line the countless loves he still owed her, and voluntarily evoked her loneliest sorrows so as not to leave him alone in his weeping.</t5504> <t5505>At dawn, after a clumsy and brief sleep, Aureliano regained consciousness of his headache.</t5505> <t5506>He opened his eyes and remembered the child.</t5506>
<t5507>He did not find him in the bassinet.</t5507> <t5508>At first, he experienced an explosion of joy, believing that Amaranta Úrsula had awakened from death to take care of the child.</t5508> <t5509>But the corpse was a mound of stones under the blanket.</t5509> <t5510>Aware that upon arriving he had found the bedroom door open, Aureliano crossed the corridor saturated with the morning sighs of oregano, and peeked into the dining room, where the remnants of the childbirth were still present: the large pot, the bloodstained sheets, the ash pots, and the twisted umbilical cord of the child in an open diaper on the table, next to the scissors and the thread.</t5510> <t5511>The idea that the midwife had returned for the child during the night gave him a moment of calm to think.</t5511> <t5512>He collapsed into the rocking chair, the same one in which Rebeca had sat in the early days of the house to give embroidery lessons, and in which Amaranta played Chinese checkers with Colonel Gerineldo Márquez, and in which Amaranta Úrsula sewed the child's clothes, and in that flash of clarity, he realized that he was incapable of bearing on his soul the overwhelming weight of so much past.</t5512> <t5513>Wounded by the mortal spears of his own and others' nostalgias, he admired the impassiveness of the cobweb on the dead rose bushes, the perseverance of the weeds, the patience of the air in the radiant February dawn.</t5513> <t5514>And then he saw the child.</t5514> <t5515>It was a swollen and dried-up skin, which all the ants in the world were laboriously dragging towards their nests along the stone path of the garden.</t5515> <t5516>Aureliano could not move.</t5516> <t5517>Not because he was paralyzed by astonishment, but because in that prodigious instant, the definitive keys of Melquíades were revealed to him, and he saw the epigraph of the parchments perfectly ordered in the time and space of men:</t5517> <t5518>The first of the lineage is tied to a tree and the last is being eaten by ants.</t5518>
<t5519>Aureliano had never been more lucid in any act of his life than when he forgot his dead and the pain of his dead, and nailed the doors and windows shut again with Fernanda's crossbars to avoid being disturbed by any temptation of the world, because he then knew that his destiny was written in Melquíades' parchments.</t5519><t5520>He found them intact among the prehistoric plants and the steaming puddles and the luminous insects that had banished all traces of human passage on earth from the room, and he did not have the serenity to bring them to light, but right there, standing, without the slightest difficulty, as if they had been written in Spanish under the dazzling midday brightness, he began to decipher them aloud.</t5520><t5521>It was the history of the family, written by Melquíades down to its most trivial details, a hundred years in advance.</t5521><t5522>He had written it in Sanskrit, which was his mother tongue, and had encoded the even verses with the private key of Emperor Augustus, and the odd ones with Spartan military codes.</t5522><t5523>The final protection, which Aureliano began to glimpse when he let himself be confused by the love of Amaranta Úrsula, lay in the fact that Melquíades had not ordered the events in the conventional time of men, but had concentrated a century of daily episodes so that they all coexisted in an instant.</t5523><t5524>Fascinated by the discovery, Aureliano read aloud, without skipping, the sung encyclicals that Melquíades himself had made Arcadio listen to, and which were actually the predictions of his execution, and he found announced the birth of the most beautiful woman in the world who was ascending to heaven in body and soul, and he learned the origin of two posthumous twins who renounced deciphering the parchments, not only due to incapacity and inconstancy but because their attempts were premature.</t5524><t5525>At this point, impatient to know his own origin, Aureliano made a leap.</t5525><t5526>Then the wind began, warm, incipient, full of voices from the past, murmurs of ancient geraniums, sighs of disappointments prior to the most tenacious nostalgias.</t5526><t5527>He did not notice it because at that moment he was discovering the first signs of his being, in a lustful grandfather who let himself be carried away by frivolity through a hallucinated wasteland, in search of a beautiful woman whom he would not make happy.</t5527><t5528>Aureliano recognized him, pursued the hidden paths of his descent, and found the moment of his own conception among the scorpions and yellow butterflies of a twilight bath, where a craftsman satisfied his lust with a woman who gave herself to him out of rebellion.</t5528><t5529>He was so absorbed that he did not feel the second onslaught of the wind either, whose cyclonic force tore the doors and windows from their hinges, ripped off the roof of the eastern gallery, and uprooted the foundations.</t5529><t5530>Only then did he discover that Amaranta Úrsula was not his sister, but his aunt, and that Francis Drake had attacked Riohacha only so that they could seek each other through the most intricate labyrinths of blood, until they engendered the mythological animal that was to put an end to the lineage.</t5530><t5531>Macondo was already a terrifying whirlwind of dust and debris centrifuged by the wrath of the biblical hurricane, when Aureliano skipped eleven pages to avoid wasting time on too well-known facts, and began to decipher the moment he was living, deciphering it as he lived it, prophesying himself in the act of deciphering the last page of the parchments, as if he were seeing himself in a talking mirror.</t5531><t5532>Then he made another leap to anticipate the predictions and find out the date and circumstances of his death.</t5532><t5533>However, before reaching the final verse, he had already understood that he would never leave that room, for it was foreseen that the city of mirrors (or mirages) would be swept away by the wind and banished from the memory of men at the moment when Aureliano Babilonia finished deciphering the parchments, and that everything written in them was unrepeatable from always and forever, because the lineages condemned to a hundred years of solitude did not have a second chance on earth.</t5533>
