<t0>Chapter 1</t0>
<t1>Many years later, as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buendía was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice.</t1><t2>At that time, Macondo was a village of twenty adobe houses, built on the bank of a river of clear water that ran along a bed of polished stones, which were white and enormous, like prehistoric eggs.</t2><t3>The world was so recent that many things lacked names, and in order to indicate them it was necessary to point.</t3><t4>Every year during the month of March, a family of ragged gypsies would set up their tent near the village and with a great uproar of pipes and kettledrums they would display new inventions.</t4><t5>First, they brought the magnet.</t5><t6>A heavy gypsy with an untamed beard and sparrow hands, who introduced himself as Melquíades, put on a bold demonstration of what he himself called the eighth wonder of the learned alchemists of Macedonia.</t6><t7>He went from house to house dragging two metal ingots, and everybody was amazed to see pots, pans, tongs, and braziers tumble down, the boards creak from the nails and screws trying to emerge, and even things that had been lost for a long time appeared from where they had been searched for most.</t7>
<t8>Then, everyone was drawn out into the streets, flocking noisily, following the delightful magic tricks of Menkyađêt.</t8> <t9>"Every object has a life," the gypsy advertised in a shrill voice, "the issue is knowing how to awaken its soul."</t9> <t10>José Arcadio Buendía, whose imagination often went far beyond the essence of nature and exceeded by far the miracles and mystical tricks, thought that this useless invention could be used to extract gold from the earth.</t10> <t11>Menkyađêt, being a noble person, warned him in advance: "This thing cannot be used for that purpose." But José Arcadio Buendía, not believing in the noble nature of the gypsies at that time, immediately traded a donkey and a pair of goats for two magnets.</t11> <t12>Úrsula Iguarán, his wife, who had thought of using these livestock to expand their dilapidated house, could not persuade him.</t12> <t13>"Oh dear, we will have plenty of gold to build a house, don't worry," he retorted.</t13> <t14>For several months, he worked tirelessly to turn his predictions into reality. He meticulously dug all over the region, even under the riverbed, dragging the two magnets and loudly reciting Menkyađêt's prayer.</t14> <t15>The only thing he unearthed was a 15th-century suit of armor, covered in rust, inside like a giant pumpkin filled with stones. When José Arcadio Buendía and his four-man excavation team dismantled this armor, they found a human skeleton turned to lime, with a copper reliquary containing a lock of women's hair dangling from its neck.</t15>
<t16>The gypsies returned to the village in March.</t16><t17>This time they brought with them a telescope and a magnifying glass with a mirror as large as a drum, which they displayed as if they were the latest discoveries of the Jews in Amsterdam.</t17><t18>They had a gypsy girl sit at the entrance of the village and placed the telescope right at the entrance of the tent.</t18><t19>After paying five reals, the villagers peered through the telescope and saw the gypsy girl as if she were within arm's reach.</t19><t20>"Science has shortened distances," Melquiades advertised: "Soon, without having to leave one's own house, people will be able to know anything that happens on earth."</t20><t21>One scorching afternoon, they conducted a terrifying experiment with the giant magnifying glass: they piled a heap of dry grass in the middle of the road and focused the sun's rays through the magnifying glass, causing the entire heap to burst into flames.</t21><t22>José Arcadio Buendía, still disheartened by the failure of using magnets to find gold, conceived the idea of using this invention as a weapon. Once again, Melquiades dissuaded him.</t22><t23>But then Melquiades had to take back the two magnets and accept three colonial coins in exchange for the magnifying glass from José Arcadio Buendía.</t23><t24>Úrsula wept bitterly.</t24><t25>That money was part of the gold coins her father had saved throughout his life of poverty and had buried under the bed for emergencies.</t25><t26>José Arcadio Buendía, without even intending to comfort his wife, threw himself wholeheartedly into experiments with the passion of a scientist and even ventured into deadly dangers.</t26><t27>To demonstrate the magnifying glass's effectiveness against enemies, he stood right in the focal point of the sunlight concentrated by the magnifying glass and got burned, the burns becoming sores that took a long time to heal.</t27><t28>He nearly burned down the house because he couldn't bear his wife's scolding, who had warned him of the dangers of this invention. He locked himself in his room for hours, calculating the strategic possibilities of the new weapon until he wrote a clear and persuasive pedagogical guide. He sent it to the authorities, accompanied by personal experience evidence and several explanatory drawings.</t28><t29>He entrusted it to a messenger.</t29><t30>This man crossed forests, got lost in dreadful swamps, crossed raging rivers, nearly lost his life to wild beasts, despair, and disease before finding the path frequented by the mail carriers' mules.</t30><t31>Despite the difficult journey to the capital at that time, José Arcadio Buendía planned to quickly manufacture the weapon if the government ordered a demonstration in front of military officials, and he would personally instruct them in the complex art of solar-powered warfare.</t31><t32>For many years, he awaited the government's reply.</t32><t33>Finally, tired of waiting, he complained to Melquiades about the failure of his project at its very inception.</t33><t34>Thus, the gypsies once again demonstrated their noble nature: they returned his doubloons and took back the magnifying glass, leaving him with several Portuguese maps and some nautical instruments.</t34><t35>Melquiades himself wrote a concise summary of Father Hermann's studies and placed it where he could use the telescope, compass, and sextant.</t35><t36>During the long, endless rainy months, José Arcadio Buendía isolated himself in the small room at the back of the house so that no one could disturb him during his experiments.</t36><t37>By completely abandoning his regular eating and sleeping habits, he spent entire nights in the yard tracking the stars' paths and nearly developed a headache from his desire to devise an accurate method to find the South. Once he mastered the use and control of the instruments, he conceived of a vast space that allowed him to sail on unknown seas, reach uninhabited lands, and befriend illustrious people without leaving his desk.</t37><t38>It was during this period that he developed the habit of talking to himself, wandering around the house without noticing anyone while Úrsula and the children weeded the garden, tended to the bananas, taro, cassava, yams, pumpkins, and eggplants.</t38><t39>Without any warning, he suddenly ceased all his fervent activities to immerse himself in contemplation.</t39><t40>For several days, he seemed bewitched, whispering to himself a series of astonishing hypotheses without trusting his own understanding.</t40><t41>Finally, at lunchtime on a Tuesday in December, he released all the tension in his mind.</t41><t42>The children would remember forever the solemnity of their father as he sat at the head of the table, trembling with fever, emaciated from prolonged observation and the bitterness of his imagination.</t42><t43>He announced his discovery to them: "The earth is round, like an orange."</t43>
<t44>Mrs. Úrsula couldn't take it anymore.</t44> <t45>"If you are crazy, then be crazy by yourself," she screamed, "but please don't fill the children's heads with your wild ideas."</t45> <t46>José Arcadio Buendía remained silent, not allowing himself to be intimidated by his wife's outburst, during which she had angrily thrown the telescope to the floor, shattering it.</t46> <t47>He made another one and gathered the men of the village in the small room, where, using theories incomprehensible to them, he demonstrated the possibility of returning to the starting point if ships kept sailing eastward.</t47> <t48>The entire village unanimously agreed that José Arcadio Buendía had lost his mind.</t48>
<t49>At that moment, Melquíades returned to sort everything out.</t49> <t50>He openly praised human intelligence by simply studying astronomy, having developed a theory that had been recognized in practice even though until then no one in the village of Macondo had known about it, and to express his admiration, he gave José Arcadio Buendía an alchemy laboratory, a memento that would have a decisive influence on the future of this village.</t50>
<t51>In those days, Melquíades aged so quickly that everyone was astonished.</t51> <t52>During his initial visits to the village, he was almost the same age as José Arcadio Buendía.</t52> <t53>But while the latter maintained his robust health, the kind that could bring down a horse by grabbing its ears, the gypsy seemed to have been debilitated by terrible pains.</t53> <t54>In fact, it was the result of numerous strange diseases he had contracted during his travels around the world.</t54>
<t55>According to his own words as he recounted to José Arcadio Buendía while helping him set up the laboratory, death chased him across the land, sniffing at his trouser legs but never managing to catch him.</t55> <t56>His life was a continuous escape from countless calamities and misfortunes that had befallen humanity.</t56> <t57>He survived leprosy in Persia, scurvy in the Malay Archipelago, leprosy in Algeria, dropsy in Japan, the plague on the island of Madagascar, earthquakes in Sicily, and the daily shipwrecks in the e.</t57> <t58>That magnificent man, who claimed to possess the secrets of Nostradamus, was a melancholic figure, surrounded by a sad sun, with Asian eyes that seemed to have seen the dark side of things. He wore a wide-brimmed black hat that looked like a crow's wing and an overcoat covered with centuries-old green moss.</t58> <t59>But despite his vast knowledge and mysterious activities, he still had a human quality, a worldly nature, that tied him to the trivial matters of everyday life: he lamented the weariness of old age, the strain of economic hardship, and he had not smiled for a long time because scurvy had taken all his teeth.</t59> <t60>José Arcadio Buendía understood that the stifling afternoon when Melquíades confided his personal stories would forever l</t60><t61>ast</t61>
<t62>the origin of a great friendship.</t62> <t63>The children were full of admiration for his legendary stories.</t63> <t64>Aureliano, at that time not yet five years old, would have to remember for the rest of his life the image of Melquiades that he had seen: he sat letting the blinding white light from the window shine on his face, while sweat streamed down his temples, and with the deep resonant voice of a grand organ, he illuminated the darkest regions of imagination.</t64> <t65>José Arcadio, his older brother, would probably pass down that marvelous image to his descendants as a cherished heirloom.</t65> <t66>In contrast, Úrsula retained a bad memory of that visit, because she entered the room just as Melquiades, in his absent-mindedness, had broken a bottle of mercury.</t66>
<t67>- Is that the smell of the devil? - she asked.</t67>
<t68>- Absolutely not, - Menkyadet defended.</t68> <t69>- It has been confirmed that demons have the smell of sulfur, but this one merely has the smell of mercury, ma'am!</t69>
<t70>Always with a pedagogical demeanor, he conducted a display on the bizarre properties of cinnabar, but Úrsula paid no attention and instead took the children to pray.</t70> <t71>That smell of death, closely associated with the memory of Melquíades, would forever remain in her mind.</t71>
<t72>The rudimentary laboratory - not to mention the numerous funnels, test tubes, filters, and sieves - included a basic vessel which was a long, narrow-necked glass flask modeled after the alchemical flask and a distillation pot made by the gypsies according to the modern description of the three-armed distillation pot of Maria the Jewess.</t72> <t73>Besides these, Melquíades also left behind seven metals symbolizing the seven planets, models of Moses and Zosimos; a fake gold nugget, and a notebook containing instructions and illustrations describing the processes of the great alchemy, which would allow anyone who could interpret them to intend to practice the craft of making the philosopher's stone.</t73> <t74>Seduced by the seemingly simple method of making fake gold, for several weeks, José Arcadio Buendía persuaded Úrsula to let him dig up their gold coins to multiply them.</t74> <t75>Faced with her husband's eccentricity, Úrsula had to yield to him as she had always done before.</t75> <t76>So José Arcadio Buendía poured thirty doubloons into a pan, mixing them with copper powder, sulfur powder, and lead powder.</t76> <t77>Then he placed them in a deep pan and heated them in a double boiler over the fire until they melted into a thick, syrupy liquid, reeking of a burnt smell, more like burnt candy than precious gold.</t77> <t78>During the arduous and disappointing distillation process, this alloy along with the seven metals symbolizing the seven planets was soaked in a solution of concentrated mercury and sulfate salts, then they were soaked again in a pan of lard (since there was no turnip oil, lard had to be used) to be heated in a double boiler over the fire.</t78> <t79>Finally, Úrsula's precious gold, after the elaborate cooking process, turned into something resembling thick porridge, burnt to a crisp, sticking tightly to the bottom of the pan, impossible to scrape off.</t79>
<t80>When the gypsies returned to this village, Úrsula tried to prevent the villagers from going to see them.</t80> <t81>But curiosity always overcomes fear, because that day, the gypsies ran all over the village blowing horns and beating drums noisily, while the announcer proclaimed that they would display the most marvelous achievement of the Nacians.</t81> <t82>So the whole village flocked to the gypsies' tent.</t82> <t83>Paying a penny at the entrance, they saw a young, healthy Melquiades, with smooth skin and a new set of gleaming white teeth.</t83> <t84>Those who remembered his scurvy-ridden gums, sunken cheeks, and dark lips were astonished by the convincing experiment demonstrating the extraordinary abilities of the gypsies.</t84> <t85>The people transitioned from amazement to fear when they saw Melquiades remove his teeth, perfectly new, set in two gums, and show them to everyone for a moment—in that fleeting moment, Melquiades reverted to the decrepit old man he had been in previous years—then he reinserted them into his gums and smiled with all the youthful vigor that had just been restored.</t85> <t86>Even José Arcadio Buendía had to admit that Melquiades' knowledge had reached unimaginable heights, but then he felt a healthier joy when the gypsies privately explained to him the method of planting false teeth.</t86> <t87>That made him find it both simple and miraculous, causing him to lose interest in alchemy overnight; he became sullen and irritable again, eating irregularly, and once more spent all day pacing around the house.</t87> <t88>"So many incredible things are happening out there," he said to Úrsula.</t88>
<t89>"Across the river, yes, right there, there are all kinds of marvelous machines, while we still live like donkeys."</t89> <t90>All those who knew him from the early days of founding Macondo were surprised to see how much he had changed under the influence of Melquíades.</t90>
<t91>At first, José Arcadio Buendía was a young nobleman who often taught people how to cultivate, advised on raising children and livestock, collaborated with everyone, even in tasks requiring physical strength, to elevate the communal life of the village, making it increasingly prosperous and peaceful.</t91> <t92>Because his house, from the very beginning, was the most beautiful house in the village, and the other houses were modeled after it: a house with a wide and bright entrance, a dining room designed with a corridor surrounded by colorful flowers, two bedrooms, a large yard with a giant chestnut tree, an orderly orchard, and a spacious lawn where goats, pigs, and chickens lived together happily.</t92> <t93>The only animals forbidden to be kept not just in this house but throughout the village were fighting cocks.</t93>
<t94>Ursula's diligence was on par with her husband's diligence.</t94> <t95>She was energetic, slender, and resolute.</t95> <t96>The trembling woman, whose singing voice no one had ever heard throughout her life, was present everywhere from dawn until dusk, always busy with the chirping chicks.</t96> <t97>Thanks to her, the earthen floor was spotless, the mud walls were clean, the furniture made by her and her husband was always tidy, and the old chests containing clothes always had a soothing scent of basil.</t97>
<t98>José Arcadio Buendía, known as the most resourceful person in the village, arranged the houses in such a way that from every house one could go to the river, and no house had to carry water more laboriously than any other. He laid out the roads so skillfully that every house received the same amount of sunlight during the hot season.</t98> <t99>In just a few years, Macondo became a neat, orderly, and industrious village, more so than any other village known to its three hundred inhabitants up to that time.</t99> <t100>In fact, it was a happy village, where no one was over thirty years old, and no one had ever died.</t100>
<t101>Since the days of founding the village, José Arcadio Buendía had been making traps and bird cages.</t101> <t102>Soon, not only his house but all the houses in the village were filled with birds: hanging nest birds, canaries, robins, and azulejos.</t102> <t103>The noise of the hanging nest birds was so loud that Úrsula had to plug her ears with beeswax to avoid losing her sense of reality.</t103> <t104>When the gypsies from Melquíades' tribe first came to sell headache pills, everyone was astonished to see how they could find their way to the village, a place shrouded in the mist of the marsh, and the gypsies admitted that they were guided by the sound of the birds singing.</t104>
<t105>Those good but still rudimentary customs were quickly swept away by the passion for magnets, by astronomical calculations, by dreams of turning lead into gold, and by the longing to know the wonders of the world of José Arcadio Buendía.</t105> <t106>Originally a lively and tidy person, José Arcadio Buendía had become lazy, dressed sloppily, and his beard grew so wild that Úrsula had to use a meat knife to trim it.</t106> <t107>Many believed that he was the victim of some kind of sinister spell.</t107>
<t108>But those who were in tune with his madness left their jobs and families to follow him, as he took upon himself the carpenter's tools and asked everyone to help open a path so that the village of Macondo could connect with the great inventions of humanity.</t108>
<t109>José Arcadio Buendía had no understanding of the geography of this region. He knew that to the east was an impassable mountain range, and on the other side of the mountains was the ancient city of Riohacha, where in times past - according to the stories told by his grandfather, the first Aureliano Buendía - the pirate Francis Drake was very fond of the sport of using cannons to hunt crocodiles, then skinning them, stuffing them with straw, and presenting them to Queen Elizabeth.</t109> <t110>In his youth, he and his friends brought their wives, children, livestock, and household utensils to cross this mountain range in search of a way to the sea, but after twenty-six arduous months, they had to give up and decided to establish the village of Macondo to avoid returning to their old home.</t110> <t111>It was a path he disliked because it could only lead him back to the past.</t111> <t112>To the south were lakes covered with ancient water hyacinths and an immense swampy world that, according to the testimony of the gypsies, had no end.</t112> <t113>The vast swamp disappeared to the west into a white expanse of water that merged with the sky, where a pod of creatures with soft skin and the heads and necks of women resided.</t113> <t114>With the enchantment of their enormous breasts, they often caused sailors to lose their lives.</t114> <t115>The gypsies took six months traveling by boat on this waterway before finally reaching a strip of land where the mailman's donkeys passed through.</t115> <t116>According to José Arcadio Buendía's calculations, the only possible way to connect with the outside civilization was the northern route.</t116> <t117>So he distributed carpentry tools and hunting weapons to the same people who had accompanied him on the journey to find and establish the village of Macondo; then he personally packed a compass and maps into his backpack and embarked on this overly bold expedition.</t117>
<t118>In the early days, they did not encounter any significant obstacles.</t118> <t119>They followed the rocky shore, going upstream until they reached the place where a 15th-century armor had been excavated a few years earlier, and from there they took a path winding through wild orange trees deep into the dense forest.</t119> <t120>At the end of the first week, they killed and roasted a deer, but they agreed to eat only half of it, salting the rest to preserve it for the coming days.</t120> <t121>With such careful planning, to sustain the expedition, they ate long-tailed parrots, a greenish meat with a musky crane flavor.</t121> <t122>After that, for more than ten days, they did not see the sun.</t122> <t123>The ground beneath their feet became damp and mushy like volcanic ash, and the vegetation grew denser and more treacherous, the sounds of birds and gibbons gradually faded, and the scenery became perpetually monotonous.</t123>
<t124>The members of the expedition felt disheartened as their oldest memories were awakened in this wet and desolate paradise, a paradise even more ancient than the one where mankind committed the original sin, a place submerged in a kind of oily evaporating mud, where machetes had to be swung to cut through the stems of white lilies and golden salamanders.</t124> <t125>For an entire week, almost no one spoke a word, their chests constricted by the hot, dry air that reeked of blood. They moved like somnambulists through a gloomy world, illuminated only by the flickering glow of fireflies.</t125>
<t126>They could not turn back because the path that had opened up behind their footsteps was soon covered by new vegetation, growing so fast it seemed visible to the eye. "Don't be afraid," José Arcadio Buendía said: "Above all, don't lose your sense of direction."</t126> <t127>Never taking his eyes off the compass, he guided everyone in the group northward, until they reached an interesting piece of land.</t127> <t128>It was a pitch-dark night, without a single star, but it was a clear night thanks to the fresh and pure air.</t128> <t129>After the long journey through the forest, everyone was exhausted and quickly set up their hammocks, and for the first time in two weeks, they slept soundly.</t129> <t130>When they woke up, the sun was already high in the sky.</t130> <t131>They were all excited.</t131> <t132>Before them was a gigantic Spanish ship, white and dusty, standing out among the ferns and palm trees in the gentle morning light.</t132>
<t133>It lay tilted to the right side.</t133> <t134>The torn sails still hung on the intact masts, lying among ropes adorned with laurel wreaths.</t134> <t135>The hull, covered by a layer of petrified fish scales and green moss, was completely fastened to the rocky ground.</t135>
<t136>The entire structure seemed to occupy its own unique setting, a setting of solitude and oblivion, a setting protected from the ravages of time and birds.</t136> <t137>Inside the ship, which the explorers had skillfully managed to open, there was nothing but a dense forest of flowers.</t137>
<t138>Encountering this ship, a sign that the sea was near, was like a cold splash of water on the burning enthusiasm of José Arcadio Buendía.</t138> <t139>He considered this as a mockery of his ironic fate: when he sought the sea, paying a high price with countless sacrifices and hardships, he couldn't find it, but now, not seeking it, it appeared right in his path as an insurmountable obstacle.</t139> <t140>Many years later, Colonel Aureliano Buendía had the opportunity to return to this area when it already had a regular postal route, and the only thing he found of that ship was a charred hull lying amidst a field of marigolds. Only then did he realize that the story was merely a product of his father's imagination.</t140> <t141>He wondered how that ship could have ventured so deep into a location that was right on the mainland.</t141>
<t142>But José Arcadio Buendía did not need to worry so much when, after four days of walking, he encountered the sea about twelve kilometers from the ship.</t142> <t143>His dreams vanished before the ashen gray sea, frothy and filthy, making all the effort he had put into his venture seem unworthy.</t143>
<t144>- What…?</t144> <t145>- He shouted -, Macondo is surrounded by water.</t145>
<t146>The notion of a Macondo peninsula grew over a long period, represented on a flawed map that José Arcadio Buendía drew when his expedition returned, drawing it with a heart full of anger, thus exaggerating the difficulties of communicating with the outside world.</t146> <t147>He did so as if to punish himself for the lack of thorough consideration when choosing this location to establish the village.</t147> <t148>"We will never get anywhere," he lamented in front of Úrsula.</t148> <t149>"We will rot alive here without ever enjoying the benefits that science brings."</t149> <t150>This clear thought, simmering for months in the laboratory, led him to conceive a plan to move Macondo to a more suitable location.</t150> <t151>But this time Úrsula opposed his hasty plans.</t151> <t152>Through the silent and skillful maneuvering of a diligent woman, she prepared the village women to resist the rashness of their husbands who had begun to prepare for the move.</t152> <t153>José Arcadio Buendía did not know when or due to what opposing force his plans became entangled in a web of reasons and contradictions, ultimately reducing them to a mere illusion.</t153>
<t154>Ursula watched him attentively, watched him until she felt a pang of compassion.</t154> <t155>It was the morning she met him in the room at the end of the house.</t155> <t156>While arranging the laboratory equipment into boxes, he rambled on about his dreams of moving the village.</t156> <t157>She let him finish.</t157> <t158>She let him nail the boxes shut and use a twig dipped in ink to write their initials on them without saying a word to him, but she understood that he knew (because she heard him say it in his monologues) that the men in the village would not participate in the relocation plan.</t158> <t159>Only when he removed the door to the room did she dare to ask why he was doing that, and he bitterly replied to her: "Because if no one else goes, then we will go."</t159> <t160>Ursula remained calm:</t160>
<t161>- We are not going anywhere either, - she said.</t161> <t162>- We are staying here because here we have given birth to a child.</t162>
<t163>- Once we do not have a loved one who has died to bury in the ground, we remain people without a homeland.</t163>
<t164>With patience, she gently argued back:</t164>
<t165>- If it is necessary for me to die so that you can stay here, I will die.</t165>
<t166>José Arcadio Buendía did not believe that his wife's determination was so serious.</t166> <t167>He tried to persuade her with his magical powers, with promises of a mystical world where just a few drops of enchanted water on the ground would be enough for trees to bear fruit according to human wishes, where all medicines and treatments for human ailments were sold at low prices.</t167> <t168>But Úrsula remained indifferent to his hypnotic sweet talk:</t168>
<t169>- Stop it, please abandon those fanciful thoughts and take care of the children, - she said.</t169> <t170>- Look at them, aren't they pitiful!</t170> <t171>Oh, the children who are not cared for according to the benevolent will of God.</t171> <t172>They are no different from donkeys.</t172>
<t173>Once again, José Arcadio Buendía attentively listened to every word his wife said.</t173> <t174>He looked out the window and saw two barefoot children in the sunny garden, and he felt that only then did they begin to exist.</t174> <t175>He noticed them thanks to Úrsula's plea.</t175> <t176>So something had happened in his state of mind, something sacred and real that took him out of his present time and gradually drifted him into the primordial realm of memory.</t176>
<t177>While Ucsula was sweeping the house, the house that she would now surely spend her whole life in, he sat engrossed watching the children until his eyes filled with tears.</t177> <t178>He wiped them away with the back of his hand, sighed with relief, and then said with dignity:</t178>
<t179>- Alright, then tell them to come help me take everything out of the chest?</t179>
<t180>José Arcadio, the eldest, was already fourteen years old.</t180> <t181>He had a square head, coarse hair, and a tendency to follow his own whims just like his father.</t181> <t182>Although he was large and muscular, it was clear that at this age he had already lost his imagination.</t182> <t183>He was conceived and born while everyone was struggling to cross the mountains, which was before the founding of Macondo.</t183> <t184>His parents thanked God when they saw that he had no animal parts on his body.</t184> <t185>Aureliano, the first to be born in Macondo, would turn six in March.</t185> <t186>He was a quiet and solitary boy.</t186> <t187>He had cried in his mother's womb and was born with his eyes wide open.</t187> <t188>While they were cutting his umbilical cord, he moved his head from side to side to familiarize himself with the objects in the room, and with a fearless curiosity, he examined the faces of the crowd.</t188> <t189>Afterward, ignoring those who came close to see him, the boy kept staring at the rickety roof that seemed about to collapse under the tremendous pressure of the rain.</t189> <t190>One day, when Aureliano was just three years old, he walked into the kitchen just as Úrsula was taking a pot of soup off the stove and placing it on the table, and it was on that day that she remembered the weight of that gaze.</t190> <t191>The boy lingered at the door, saying, "It's going to spill..."</t191> <t192>The pot had been securely placed on the table, but suddenly, just as he had predicted, it began to shake violently and then slid to the edge of the table as if pushed from within, shattering into pieces on the floor.</t192> <t193>Úrsula, terrified, recounted the story to her husband, but he explained the phenomenon as a natural occurrence.</t193> <t194>He often did that, always ignoring the presence of his children, partly because he considered childhood to be a stage of ignorance and partly because he was always too absorbed in his futile theories.</t194>
<t195>But since the morning he called the children to help him unpack the laboratory equipment from the boxes, he had dedicated to them the most precious hours of his time.</t195><t196>In the isolated room where the walls were increasingly covered with incomprehensible maps and legendary paintings, he taught them to read, write, do math, and spoke to them about the wonders of the world, not just within the limits of known knowledge but often far beyond his own imagination.</t196><t197>This is what the children had just learned: in a far southern land of Africa, there are people so wise and gentle that their only joy is to sit and contemplate; and that one can wade through the Aegean Sea by jumping from one island to another all the way to the port of Salonica.</t197><t198>Those fascinating lessons etched themselves into the children's memories, so much so that many years later, a minute before the Royalist army officer ordered the firing squad to shoot, Colonel Aureliano Buendía relived that serene March afternoon, the afternoon his father left a physics lesson unfinished, enthusiastically raising one hand in the air and half-closing his eyes to listen to the distant sounds of trumpets, drums, and the clinking of the gypsies who had come to the village many times, noisily advertising the latest astonishing invention of the wise men from Memphis.</t198>
<t199>These are the new gypsies.</t199> <t200>Young men and women, who only know their native language.</t200> <t201>They are charming specimens with smooth skin and skillful hands, whose dances and music bring loud joy to every village road.</t201> <t202>They bring with them parrots dyed in various colors that can recite Italian folk songs; a hen that lays a hundred golden eggs to the beat of a tambourine; a monkey trained to guess what you are thinking; a universal machine that can both sew buttons and cure a fever; a device to forget sad and painful memories; a leaf to forget time and thousands of other inventions, all so clever and fascinating that José Arcadio Buendía also wanted to create a memory machine to remember everything.</t202> <t203>In just a moment, the gypsies transformed the village.</t203> <t204>The people of Macondo suddenly found themselves lost in their own homeland, as they were entranced by this rich fair.</t204>
<t205>Holding each child's hand to prevent them from getting lost in the chaotic crowd, constantly bumping into magicians with gold-plated teeth and puppeteers with six arms, suffocating in the scent of anise oil and mint emanating from the crowd, José Arcadio Buendía searched everywhere for Melquíades to have him explain the unfathomable secrets of that magical restlessness.</t205> <t206>He walked and walked until he finally reached the place where Melquíades usually pitched his tent, but instead, he encountered a sullen Armenian speaking Spanish, advertising an invisible syrup.</t206> <t207>The man gulped down a glass of amber-colored liquid while José Arcadio Buendía pushed through the crowd, who were wide-eyed watching the magic tricks, and he reached the spot to inquire about Melquíades.</t207> <t208>The gypsy looked at him in surprise before disappearing into a pool of thick, hot tar, from which the answer echoed: "Melquíades is dead."</t208> <t209>Horrified by this bad news, José Arcadio Buendía stood frozen, trying to overcome his anguish, until the spectators dispersed, drawn by the calls of other magicians, and the Armenian's pool completely evaporated.</t209> <t210>Afterwards, other gypsies also confirmed to him that it was indeed true.</t210> <t211>Melquíades had died of malaria on the sand dunes of Singapore, and his body had been thrown into the deepest waters of the Java Sea.</t211> <t212>The children paid no attention to this news.</t212>
<t213>They were whining and begging their father to take them to see the new invention by the wise men of Memphis, advertised right at the entrance of the shop, which, according to rumors, belonged to Emperor Solomon.</t213> <t214>They insisted so much that José Arcadio Buendía had to pay thirty reals to enter and take his children to the middle of the shop, where a giant with a hairy body, a shaved head, a nose ring, and a heavy iron chain around his ankle was guarding a mysterious chest.</t214> <t215>When the giant opened the lid, a blast of freezing air came out from the chest.</t215> <t216>Inside the chest was a transparent block with tiny holes that, when the sunset light hit it, sparkled with all the colors of the stars.</t216> <t217>Filled with bewilderment, knowing that his children were expecting an immediate explanation, José Arcadio Buendía could only whisper:</t217>
<t218>- That is the largest diamond in the world.</t218>
<t219>- No, - the gypsy corrected, - that is ice.</t219>
<t220>Not understanding anything, José Arcadio Buendía raised his hand to touch the block of ice, but the giant quickly brushed his hand away. "If you want to touch it, you have to pay another five reals!" the giant said.</t220> <t221>José Arcadio Buendía handed over five reals and then placed his hand on the block of ice.</t221> <t222>He kept his hand there for a few minutes while his heart pounded with a mix of fear and excitement at being in contact with this marvelous object.</t222>
<t223>Not knowing what else to say, he took out ten more reals from his pocket so that his children could also experience this miraculous feeling.</t223> <t224>The boy José Arcadio did not dare to touch the block of ice.</t224> <t225>In contrast, Aureliano stepped forward, placed his hand on the block of ice, but immediately pulled it back.</t225> <t226>"Oh, it's burning hot," he exclaimed in shock.</t226> <t227>But his father paid no attention to his words.</t227> <t228>Filled with appreciation for the evident marvel before him, he momentarily forgot the failures of his futile endeavors, forgot the corpse of Melquiades thrown into the sea as food for the squids.</t228> <t229>He paid five more reals, then with his hand placed on the block of ice, as if to present a testimony from the Bible, he exclaimed:</t229>
<t230>- This is one of the greatest inventions of our time.</t230>
<t231>Chapter 2</t231>
<t232>When the pirate Francis Drake attacked Riohacha in the 16th century, Ursula Iguarán's ancestor was so astonished by the incessant church bells and the deafening cannon fire that she frantically sat down on a bed of hot coals.</t232><t233>The burn scars made her a dependent wife for the rest of her life.</t233><t234>She could only sit leaning to one side, supported by cushions, and walked awkwardly, so she never went out in public.</t234><t235>She abandoned all social activities, haunted by the thought that her body emitted an unpleasant burnt smell. Dawn would find her in the yard.</t235><t236>She didn't dare sleep because she dreamt of Englishmen with fierce dogs climbing through her bedroom window, terrifying her with horrific tortures using red-hot iron bars.</t236><t237>Her husband, a merchant from Aragon, who had two children with her, spent half his store's earnings on medicine and entertainment for his wife, hoping to alleviate her fears.</t237><t238>Finally, he gave up his trade, moved the family to a place far from the sea, in a village of gentle indigenous people deep in the mountains.</t238><t239>There, he built his wife a bedroom without windows so that in her nightmares, the pirates would have no way to jump in.</t239>
<t240>In this quiet village, long ago, there was a European tobacco farmer who was born in America. It was José Arcadio Buendía, who, together with the ancestor Úrsula, established a production enterprise that quickly amassed a large capital.</t240> <t241>Several centuries later, the grandson of the ancestor married the granddaughter of the ancestor Aragon. Therefore, whenever Úrsula left the house driven by her husband's passionate call, she remembered the coincidences that happened three hundred years ago and cursed the hour when the pirate Francis Drake attacked Riohacha.</t241> <t242>It was a simple way to relieve her worries, for in reality, they were bound together until death by a bond stronger than love: a shared torment of conscience.</t242> <t243>Being siblings, they grew up together in an old village that their forebears, through labor and traditional customs, had turned into the finest village in the province.</t243> <t244>Although their marriage was foreseen as inevitable from the moment they were born, when they expressed their desire to marry, their parents intended to prevent it.</t244> <t245>The elders feared that these two healthy individuals from families with a century-old close relationship would have to live in shame for giving birth to monstrous children.</t245> <t246>There was already a dire precedent before them.</t246> <t247>Úrsula's aunt married José Arcadio Buendía's uncle and gave birth to a child who wore baggy trousers all his life and died of bleeding after living forty-two years as a virgin, because he was born and grew up with a corkscrew-shaped tail with a tuft of hair at the end.</t247> <t248>It was a pig's tail that he never let any woman see.</t248> <t249>And he paid with his life when a butcher used a cleaver to chop off the pig's tail. José Arcadio Buendía, with the calmness of an eighteen-year-old, resolved the issue with a brief statement: "Even if it gives birth to a pig, I don't care, as long as it can talk."</t249> <t250>So they got married with a three-day-long celebration with fireworks and music bands.</t250> <t251>From then on, they would have been so happy if Úrsula's mother hadn't threatened her with all the terrifying deformities of the children she would bear, to the point that she didn't dare consummate the marriage.</t251> <t252>Fearing that her robust and unruly husband would rape her while she slept, Úrsula wore a pair of trousers made by her mother before going to bed.</t252> <t253>It was a pair of coarse cloth trousers reinforced with a system of leather straps and secured with a large iron lock.</t253> <t254>They lived like that for several months.</t254> <t255>During the day, he tended to his fighting cocks, while she sat embroidering with her mother.</t255> <t256>At night, she had to resist for hours against her husband's passionate desires, which seemed to be a substitute for physical intimacy, until the villagers sensed something unusual was happening and spread the rumor that Úrsula remained a virgin a year after marriage because her husband was impotent.</t256> <t257>José Arcadio Buendía was the last to hear the rumor.</t257>
<t258>- Ursula, you see, people are spreading rumors, - he calmly said to his wife.</t258>
<t259>- Let them say whatever they want, - she said, - as long as we know that dose is not the truth.</t259>
<t260>So the couple continued to live in that situation for about six more months, until one tragic Sunday when José Arcadio Buendía won a cockfight against Prudencio Aguilar.</t260> <t261>Angry and furious at the sight of his rooster's blood, the loser stepped away from José Arcadio Buendía so that everyone in the cockfighting ring could hear what he was about to say:</t261>
<t262>- I'm happy for you, - he shouted, - let's see if that chicken will do your wife a favor in the end.</t262>
<t263>José Arcadio Buendía remained silent, holding his rooster.</t263> <t264>"I will be back soon," he said to everyone, then he spoke to Prudencio Aguilar:</t264>
<t265>- And you, be careful, go back home and take up arms, or I will kill you.</t265>
<t266>Ten minutes later, he returned with his grandfather's sharp spear.</t266> <t267>Right at the entrance of the cockfighting ring, where half the village had gathered, Prudencio Aguilar was waiting.</t267> <t268>He didn't have time to defend himself.</t268> <t269>José Arcadio Buendía's spear, thrown with the strength of a bull and the precise trajectory of the very spear that Aureliano Buendía the First had once used to kill tigers in the region, pierced through Prudencio Aguilar's throat.</t269> <t270>That night, while everyone was mourning the corpse outside the cockfighting ring, José Arcadio Buendía entered the bedroom just as his wife was putting on her chastity belt.</t270>
<t271>Waving the spear in front of her, he commanded, "Take that off".</t271>
<t272>Ursula did not doubt her husband's decision. "I will have to take responsibility for what just happened," he groaned.</t272> <t273>José Arcadio Buendía thrust the spear into the ground.</t273>
<t274>- If we give birth to a monitor lizard, then we will raise the monitor lizard, - he said - But in this village, there will be no more people suffering because of our sins.</t274>
<t275>It was a beautiful July night, with a clear moon and a cool breeze, and they stayed up all night wrestling on the bed until dawn, paying no attention to the wind blowing into the room carrying the cries of Pruđênxiô Aghila's family.</t275>
<t276>This funeral was classified as an honorable funeral, but two people were tormented by their conscience.</t276> <t277>One sleepless night, Úrsula went to the water tank in the yard and saw Prudencio Aguilar standing right next to the jar.</t277> <t278>He stood there, pale and gloomy, trying to use a handful of straw to plug the hole in his throat.</t278> <t279>She wasn't scared but felt pity.</t279> <t280>She went back to the room to tell her husband what she had seen, but he didn't believe her.</t280> <t281>"The dead do not leave their graves," he said.</t281> <t282>"It's just that we can no longer endure the torment of our own conscience."</t282>
<t283>Two nights later, Úrsula again saw Prudencio Aguilar in the bathroom, using a rag to wipe the blood stain on his neck.</t283> <t284>On another night, she saw him walking in the rain.</t284> <t285>Angry that his wife was seeing ghosts, José Arcadio Buendía grabbed a spear and stepped into the yard.</t285> <t286>Sure enough, the melancholy ghost was standing there.</t286>
<t287>- Get the hell out of here! - José Arcadio Buendía shouted. - If you keep hanging around here, I'll kill you!</t287>
<t288>Prudencio Aguilar did not go, and José Arcadio Buendía did not dare to throw the spear.</t288> <t289>From then on, he could not sleep well.</t289> <t290>He was tormented by the immense sadness of the dead man looking at him from the rain, by the profound compassion of the dead man for the living, by the thirst of the dead man searching the house for water to moisten his dry throat. "Perhaps he is suffering greatly," Úrsula said to her husband: "He is too lonely."</t290>
<t291>She was even more moved when she recently saw the ghost opening the kitchen pot, understanding what it was looking for, and since then, she placed bowls of water all around the house for it.</t291> <t292>One night, catching the ghost washing its wounds right in his room, José Arcadio Buendía could not bear it any longer and said:</t292>
<t293>- Alright, Prudencio, - he said to the ghost, - we will leave your village, go to the farthest place we can go, and we will never return.</t293> <t294>Now you go, go peacefully.</t294>
<t295>That is the reason they crossed the mountains.</t295> <t296>A few friends of José Arcadio Buendía, all as young as he was, excited by this adventurous journey, packed their belongings and took them along with their wives and children to a land where no one had promised them anything.</t296> <t297>Before departing, José Arcadio Buendía buried his spear in the yard and one by one beheaded his magnificent fighting cocks, believing that doing so would somewhat console the spirit of Prudencio Aguilar. The only thing Úrsula took with her was a chest containing her wedding clothes, some food, and a small bag of gold coins left by her father.</t297> <t298>The group did not follow a specific route.</t298> <t299>They simply kept moving in the opposite direction of the road to Riohacha to leave no trace and avoid meeting acquaintances.</t299> <t300>It was a peculiar journey.</t300> <t301>After traveling for fourteen months, with stomachs aching from monkey meat and snake soup, Úrsula gave birth to a boy with all his parts intact. She gave birth on the road while lying on a hammock carried by two people because her legs were swollen and deformed, with veins bulging like blisters.</t301> <t302>The children were pitiful with their flat bellies and dark circles under their eyes.</t302> <t303>Yet they proved to be more resilient than their parents on this arduous journey and even enjoyed it most of the time.</t303> <t304>One morning, after nearly two years of climbing mountains, they were the first to see the western slope of the mountain range.</t304> <t305>From the cloud-covered peak, they saw the vast, flat waters of an immense swamp stretching to the other side of the world.</t305> <t306>But they never found the sea.</t306> <t307>One night, after months of wandering among the swamps, far from the last place they had encountered Indians on their path, they camped by the bank of a rocky river with water as clear as a strip of frozen crystal.</t307> <t308>Many years later, Colonel Aureliano Buendía would attempt to follow that path to attack Riohacha, and after six days, he realized it was madness.</t308> <t309>However, that night by the river, his father's companions were as desperate as drowning men with nothing to cling to, but their numbers had grown during the mountain crossing, and all of them were determined to live (of course, they had found ways) until their hair turned gray and their teeth fell out.</t309> <t310>That night, José Arcadio Buendía dreamed of a bustling city with houses made of glass walls rising right there.</t310> <t311>He asked what city it was and was given a name he had never heard before, a name that meant nothing but echoed in his dream: Macondo.</t311> <t312>The very next day, he convinced his friends that they would never find the sea.</t312> <t313>He ordered them to clear an area by the river, where it was cooler, and there they established a village.</t313>
<t314>Before the day he learned about ice, José Arcadio Buendía still did not understand the meaning of the dream about houses with glass walls.</t314> <t315>After that day, he thought he had grasped its profound meaning.</t315> <t316>He believed that in the not-too-distant future, people could mass-produce blocks of ice from the most ordinary material like water and use them to build new houses for the village.</t316> <t317>At that time, Macondo would no longer be a place so hot that iron hinges and door latches would curl from the heat, and it would become a city where it was winter all year round.</t317> <t318>If he was not eager to immediately build an ice factory, it was because he was then engrossed in educating his children, especially Aureliano, who had shown a special talent for alchemy from the very beginning.</t318> <t319>The laboratory was always spotless, without a speck of dust.</t319> <t320>Now, very calmly, not as excited by the miraculous as by reviewing Melquíades' instructions, he tried to separate Úrsula's gold from the compound that had solidified at the bottom of the pan.</t320> <t321>Young José Arcadio hardly participated in this work.</t321> <t322>While his father was fully engrossed in his work with the test tubes, the eldest son, who was naturally inclined to do as he pleased and was mature beyond his years, had grown into a robust young man.</t322> <t323>His voice had broken.</t323> <t324>His upper lip was now covered with a fine layer of fuzz.</t324> <t325>One night, Úrsula walked into the room when he had already undressed to go to bed.</t325> <t326>She was startled, feeling both embarrassed and compassionate.</t326> <t327>He was the first man, after her husband, whom she had seen naked, and he was well-prepared for life, which she found unsettling.</t327> <t328>For the third time, Úrsula was pregnant, and she relived the anxieties of her early married days.</t328>
<t329>At that time, there was a cheerful woman, coarse in manners and speech, who often came to the house. She would help with odd jobs around the house and knew how to read tarot cards.</t329><t330>Ursula confided in her about her son.</t330><t331>She thought that her son's oversized body was as abnormal as the pig's tail of their cousin.</t331><t332>The woman burst into a loud, echoing laugh that resonated throughout the house like a rushing stream of glass.</t332><t333>On the contrary, she said, "Your son will be a happy man, ma'am."</t333><t334>To affirm her prediction, a few days later she brought a deck of cards to the house, then sneaked alone into the corn storage attached to the kitchen with José Arcadio and shut the door tightly.</t334><t335>She calmly placed the deck of cards on the old carpenter's table and began to chatter about trivial matters, while the young man sat next to her, more bored than amused, waiting.</t335><t336>Suddenly, she reached out and hugged him tightly.</t336><t337>"Oh, it's wonderful," she exclaimed with genuine surprise, and that was the only thing she could say.</t337><t338>José Arcadio felt his muscles go limp, terrified, and wanted to scream.</t338><t339>The woman did not instruct him on anything.</t339><t340>But all that night, José Arcadio kept searching for her in the smoky scent emanating from her armpits, and that smell clung to his skin.</t340><t341>He wanted to be with her all the time, wanted her to be his mother.</t341><t342>He wanted them, he and her, to never leave the corn storage, wanted her to say "oh, it's wonderful" to him, wanted her to hug him again and say "oh, it's wonderful."</t342><t343>One day, he couldn't bear it any longer and went to her house to find her.</t343>
<t344>He came to visit the house but didn't feel at ease, sitting in the living room, waiting in silence.</t344> <t345>In that moment, he didn't crave for her.</t345> <t346>He found her completely different from the image that her scent evoked; at that moment, she seemed like a thirsty woman.</t346> <t347>He drank coffee and then bid farewell to the rickety house.</t347> <t348>That night, in the fear caused by insomnia, he longed for her intensely again, but at that moment he didn't love her like he did in the corn storage, rather it felt as empty as that afternoon.</t348>
<t349>A few days later, the woman suddenly called him to her house while she was at home with her mother. She pulled him into the bedroom under the pretext of teaching him to play cards.</t349> <t350>So she freely embraced him, to the point where he lost all pleasure after the initial ecstasy, and then he felt more fear than enjoyment. She coquettishly demanded that he come to find her that very night.</t350> <t351>He had already agreed, but as he walked out, he realized that he couldn't go.</t351> <t352>Yet that night, on the bed burning like hot coals, he understood that he needed to go find her even though he knew it was impossible.</t352> <t353>He fumbled to put on his clothes, ears straining in the darkness to hear the steady breathing of his younger brother, his father's coughing in the next room, the wheezing of the hens in the yard, the buzzing of mosquitoes, the pounding of his own heart, and the noise of the world that he had never heard before, then he stepped out onto the road that was quietly sleeping.</t353> <t354>He sincerely hoped that the door had been properly latched and not just left ajar as she had promised him.</t354> <t355>But the door was still unlatched.</t355>
<t356>He gently pushed the door with his finger, and the hinges creaked, sounding both sad and resonant, sending chills down his spine.</t356> <t357>Ever since he stepped in, carefully sliding his shoulder to avoid making any noise, he could still sense that smell.</t357> <t358>He was still in the living room, where his three younger brothers had hung their hammocks in places he couldn't identify even now, and in the darkness, he couldn't determine their positions. So he had to feel his way around, pushing the door to the room and making his way there without mistaking the bed he was supposed to lie on.</t358> <t359>He searched for it.</t359> <t360>He stumbled over a hammock rope hung lower than he had expected, and the man who had been snoring until then, still in a dream-like state, said in a clear voice: "It was the fourth day."</t360> <t361>When he pushed the bedroom door, he couldn't avoid tripping over the raised edge of the floor.</t361>
<t362>In the pitch-black darkness, suddenly, with an irresistible longing, he realized that he had completely lost his way.</t362> <t363>In this cramped room were his mother, his sister, her husband, and her three children sleeping, and also the woman, who perhaps was not waiting for him, had also fallen asleep.</t363> <t364>Perhaps he would not have followed that scent if it hadn't been so pervasive throughout the house.</t364> <t365>That woman's scent seemed both illusory and real, as if it was always right on his skin.</t365> <t366>He stood still like a statue for a long moment, surprised, wondering how he had come to this empty abyss.</t366> <t367>At that moment, a hand with spread fingers groping in the darkness touched his face.</t367> <t368>That hand was not surprised, because even though it did not know exactly who he was, it was waiting for him.</t368>
<t369>So he trusted that hand and in a state of terrible exhaustion, he let it drag him to a place that wasn't very comfortable, where it stripped him naked, fondled him like fondling a potato, turned him to the left and then to the right, where he no longer smelled the scent of a woman but only the smell of devil's urine, and where when he tried to recall her face, he instead pictured Mrs. Ucsula's face; then he bewilderedly realized that he was doing something he had long desired but never thought he could actually do, not knowing what it was like because he couldn't tell where his feet were, where his head was, and didn't know whose feet or head they were, and he felt he couldn't endure any longer the sharp pain in his kidneys, the twisting pain in his stomach, he panicked and felt a dizzying desire both to run away and to stay forever in this despairing silence and terrifying loneliness.</t369>
<t370>The woman's name was Pila Tecnêra.</t370> <t371>She was a member of the group of migrants who founded the village of Macondo, dragged along by her family to separate her from the man who had raped her when she was fourteen, and pursued her until she was twenty-one, but never decided to publicly acknowledge their relationship because he was a scoundrel.</t371> <t372>He promised to follow her to the ends of the earth, but soon after, when everything had settled down, she kept waiting, equating him with tall men and short men, with red-haired men and black-haired men, those whom the cards promised her would come from the sea and from the land in three days, three months, or three years.</t372> <t373>While waiting, she lost the firmness of her thighs, the fullness of her breasts, her graceful charm, but she always kept her heart burning with passion.</t373> <t374>Fervent in his obsession, every night, José Arcadio sought her warmth by navigating through that maze.</t374> <t375>Sometimes, when he found the door locked, he knocked several times, knowing that if he dared to knock once, he had to knock until the end, and after persistently waiting, she opened the door for him.</t375>
<t376>During the day, dozing off due to sleepiness, he silently savored the pleasure of the previous night.</t376> <t377>But when she stepped into the house, cheerful, innocent, and playful, he didn't have to exert himself to hide his fatigue, because the woman with the crisp laughter that had startled the pigeons was so satisfied that she taught him to breathe deeply, to keep his heart from pounding too hard, and allowed him to understand why men fear death so much.</t377> <t378>He was so engrossed in his thoughts that he didn't comprehend the overflowing joy of everyone over the fact that his father and younger brother had caused a commotion in the house by announcing they had melted the alloy and extracted Ursula's gold.</t378>
<t379>Indeed, after days of diligent and enthusiastic work, José Arcadio Buendía and his son achieved results.</t379> <t380>Úrsula was so delighted that she had to thank God for the invention of alchemy, while the villagers gathered in the laboratory and the family invited them to enjoy guava jelly with biscuits to celebrate the feat. José Arcadio Buendía showed them the metal pot with the recovered gold, as if he had just created it.</t380> <t381>After showing everyone around, he finally brought it before his eldest son, who had hardly set foot in the laboratory recently.</t381> <t382>Placing the dry, golden metal in front of him, he asked, "What do you think?".</t382> <t383>José Arcadio sincerely replied to his father:</t383>
<t384>- That dog shit thing!</t384>
<t385>His father immediately slapped him hard on the mouth, causing him great pain, making him bleed and tear up.</t385> <t386>That night, Pila Tecnêra applied a poultice to the swollen area, fumbled in the dark for the bottle of alcohol and cotton, and did everything she wanted but did not make him uncomfortable, loving him without causing him pain.</t386> <t387>They became close, and just a few minutes later, without anyone telling them to, they were whispering and talking to each other:</t387>
<t388>"I want only you by my side," he said, "one day soon, I will tell everyone about us to put an end to all these secretive games once and for all."</t388>
<t389>She did not intend to stop him.</t389>
<t390>- That would be wonderful, - she said, - if it were just the two of us alone, we would light up the lamps to see each other clearly and you could scream out everything you like without worrying about anyone disturbing us, and I would whisper in your ear all the dirty words I could think of.</t390>
<t391>This conversation, his resentment towards his father, and the urgent possibility of an excessive love affair made him bolder. Suddenly, he told everything to his younger brother.</t391>
<t392>At first, Aureliano only understood the danger and calamities that would arise from his brother's reckless actions, but he had yet to feel the intoxicating pleasure of the story.</t392> <t393>Then the desire gradually took over him.</t393> <t394>He made his brother recount the thrilling details meticulously, empathizing with his brother's excruciating pain and soft pleasure; he also felt anxious and delighted.</t394> <t395>He stayed awake waiting for his brother until near dawn, tossing and turning on the bed as if someone had placed hot coals on it, and when his brother returned, both of them were wide awake talking until it was time to get up, so before long both brothers were groggy, fed up with alchemy and their father's profound knowledge, and both retreated into solitude.</t395>
<t396>"The children in this house are like idiots, always dazed," Ucsula said.</t396> <t397>"Maybe they are being bothered by worms."</t397> <t398>She prepared a bowl of paico tobacco water for them and both of them calmly drank it, and within a day they had sat on the potty eleven times, expelling a few pinkish worms.</t398> <t399>The two brothers eagerly showed everyone because it allowed them to distract Ucsula from the true cause of their melancholy.</t399> <t400>At that moment, Aureliano not only understood but also could feel his brother's sexual experiences as if he had gone through them himself, because once when his brother was describing in great detail how to make love, he interrupted to ask: "How did you feel?"...</t400> <t401>Without hesitation, José Arcadio immediately replied:</t401>
<t402>- It was as if the heavens and earth were shaking.</t402>
<t403>At two o'clock in the morning on a Thursday in January, Amaranta was born.</t403> <t404>Before anyone else entered the room, Úrsula examined the entire body of the infant.</t404> <t405>It was light and plump like a young lizard, but all its parts were human.</t405> <t406>Aureliano only learned the good news when he saw many people flocking to his house.</t406> <t407>To avoid this noise, he left the house to find his brother, who had left his bed since eleven o'clock, and it was such a sudden decision that he didn't have time to ask himself how to get his brother out of Pila Tecnéra's room.</t407> <t408>He wandered around her house for several hours, whistling continuously as a signal until dawn forced him to return.</t408> <t409>In his mother's room, he found José Arcadio with a calm face, playing with the newly born sister.</t409>
<t410>Ursula had just about finished her forty-day maternity leave when the gypsies arrived in the village.</t410> <t411>These were the same circus performers and puppeteers who had previously brought ice here.</t411>
<t412>Unlike Menkyadet's group, they soon displayed consumer goods instead of just the achievements of scientific progress as before.</t412> <t413>When they brought ice, they did not advertise its practical benefits for human life but only promoted it as a simple magic trick.</t413> <t414>This time, alongside other entertainments, they brought a flying carpet.</t414> <t415>They did not introduce it as a fundamental contribution to transportation development but presented it as a toy.</t415> <t416>Of course, the villagers dug out their last bits of gold to enjoy a swift flight over the rooftops in the village.</t416>
<t417>Taking advantage of the public's noisy and fascinating forgiveness, José Arcadio and Pilar Ternera lived hours of freedom.</t417> <t418>They were two lovers blissfully happy amidst the crowd, to the point of believing that their love was deeper and more profound than the ultimate and immediate pleasure they experienced during their secret nights.</t418> <t419>However, Pilar Ternera shattered that joy.</t419> <t420>Elated by José Arcadio's passion while enjoying their couple's happiness, she confused the manner and timing of her words, suddenly placing a heavy responsibility on his shoulders as vast as the globe.</t420> <t421>"Now, you are a man," she told him.</t421> <t422>And because he did not understand what she had just said, she calmly explained it in detail:</t422>
<t423>- It means you will have a son.</t423>
<t424>For several days in a row, José Arcadio did not dare to leave the house.</t424><t425>Just hearing the giggling of Pilar Ternera was enough to make him hide in the laboratory, where the handicrafts, the fruits of alchemy, were coming to life thanks to Úrsula's charity.</t425><t426>José Arcadio Buendía warmly welcomed the wayward son and guided him as an apprentice in the alchemical work that he had thoroughly understood.</t426><t427>One afternoon, the two brothers were very excited by the sight of a flying carpet passing by the laboratory window, carrying the gypsy driver and several village children who were happily waving, and José Arcadio Buendía did not even glance at the flying carpet.</t427><t428>"Let them dream," he said, "we will fly higher than them with scientific means far superior to this pathetic flying carpet."</t428><t429>Even though he had to pretend to be interested in the work, José Arcadio could never understand the grand possibilities of the alchemical furnace, which to him was simply a poorly made glass jar.</t429><t430>He lost his appetite, suffered from insomnia, became irritable, just like his father when he faced failures in some tasks, and his erratic state forced his father to take over all the work in the alchemical furnace, thinking that the work was too exhausting for him.</t430><t431>Aureliano, of course, understood that his brother's suffering had nothing to do with the alchemical furnace, but he could not get him to reveal the deeper issue. José Arcadio was no longer as lively as before.</t431><t432>From being witty and open, he became secretive and difficult.</t432><t433>Too fond of solitude, always angry at everything around him, one night, as usual, he left his bed empty and went out, but instead of going to Pilar Ternera's house, he went straight to the fair.</t433><t434>After wandering through all the amusements, uninterested in any of them, he noticed someone not performing, a very young gypsy girl, almost still a child, wearing a necklace full of fake crystal gems.</t434><t435>She was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen until then.</t435><t436>He was in the middle of a crowd engrossed in watching a man turn into a snake for not obeying his parents.</t436>
<t437>Hôsê Accađiô didn't pay attention.</t437> <t438>While the interrogation of the snake-man was taking place, he weaved through the crowd to reach the first place where he met the gypsy girl, stopping behind her.</t438> <t439>From behind, he wrapped his arms around her waist.</t439> <t440>She tried to break free, but Hôsê Accađiô held her tighter.</t440> <t441>So she was moved, standing still but still turning her back to him, trembling with surprise and fear, unable to believe it was real; finally, she turned her face, looking at him with a trembling smile.</t441> <t442>Meanwhile, two gypsy men shoved the snake-man into a bag and carried him inside the shop.</t442> <t443>A gypsy ringleader turned to the audience and said:</t443>
<t444>- Ladies and gentlemen, now we would like to present a thrilling act about a woman who, every night just like tonight, has been beheaded at this exact hour for one hundred and fifty years for daring to look at what she shouldn't have.</t444>
<t445>Hôsê Accađiô and the girl did not watch the beheading act.</t445> <t446>They went to her place, where in desperate longing they indulged in kissing while undressing.</t446> <t447>The gypsy girl took off all her outer garments, petticoats, heavily padded corset, and fake crystal pearl necklace, and suddenly her once full breasts and wide hips disappeared.</t447> <t448>In reality, her body was like a dry branch, with a flat chest and thin thighs that were not even as big as Hôsê Accađiô's arms, but she had a bold demeanor and a warm scent that compensated.</t448> <t449>However, Hôsê Accađiô couldn't immediately respond to her fervor because they were in a public place, where gypsies frequently passed by, sometimes carrying circus equipment, sometimes in costume, and occasionally gathering beside the bed to play a game of dice.</t449> <t450>A lamp hanging from a pole in the middle of the yard illuminated the surroundings.</t450> <t451>When they stopped caressing each other, Hôsê Accađiô lay naked, stretched out on the bed, not knowing what else to do, while the girl tried to seduce him.</t451> <t452>Later, a sleek-skinned gypsy woman walked in, followed by a man who was neither part of the circus troupe nor from the village.</t452> <t453>Then both of them undressed right in front of the bed where Hôsê Accađiô was lying.</t453> <t454>Without intending to tease him, the woman looked at Hôsê Accađiô, filled with desire, eagerly admiring his magnificent resting organ.</t454>
<t455>- Oh, my friend? - She exclaimed. - May God protect your sister for you, my friend.</t455>
<t456>The girlfriend of José Arcadio requested to be left alone and the couple lay down on the floor right next to the bed.</t456> <t457>The passion of the others awakened José Arcadio's fervor.</t457> <t458>From the very first moment, the girl's bones seemed to come loose, cracking like dominoes touching each other, her skin slick with a yellowish sweat, her eyes brimming with tears, her whole body emitting a moaning sound and a persistent smell of mud lingering around.</t458> <t459>But the resilient girl endured the encounter with a steadfast character and an admirable courage.</t459>
<t460>At that moment, José Arcadio felt himself being lifted to a breathless state where his heart melted into a well of gentle sensuality flowing into the girl through her ears and coming out through her mouth, transformed into words translated into her language.</t460> <t461>It was Thursday.</t461> <t462>On Saturday night, with a red scarf on his head, José Arcadio left home with the gypsies.</t462>
<t463>When Úrsula noticed his absence, she hurriedly went around the village looking for him.</t463> <t464>At the desolate camp, there was nothing more than a stream of dirty water amidst the still-hot ashes in the extinguished hearths.</t464> <t465>A person searching for fake crystal beads in the garbage told Úrsula that last night they had seen her son mingling with the noisy gypsies, pushing a cage cart with the snake-man inside.</t465>
<t466>"So he has gone off with the gypsies," she screamed into his ear, showing no sign of worry at the news of their son's disappearance.</t466>
<t467>- God willing, it will be so, - José Arcadio Buendía said as he continued to grind the material that had been ground a thousand times in the mortar, fired, and then ground again.</t467> <t468>- That way, it will learn to be human.</t468>
<t469>Ursula asked everyone which direction the gypsies had gone.</t469> <t470>On the way, she kept asking, and people kept pointing her in the direction, so she continued on, thinking there was still time to catch up with her son.</t470> <t471>In this manner, she went farther and farther from the village until she realized she had gone so far that she didn't think she could return.</t471> <t472>José Arcadio Buendía only noticed his wife's absence at eight o'clock in the evening, when he placed the remelted alloy on a layer of mulch and went to see why baby Amaranta was crying hoarsely.</t472> <t473>A few hours later, he gathered a group of men, equipped them neatly, placed baby Amaranta in the hands of a woman who agreed to nurse her, and then went to look for Ursula.</t473> <t474>Aureliano also went with them.</t474> <t475>The indigenous fishermen, through gestures, indicated to them that they hadn't seen anyone pass by since early morning.</t475> <t476>After three days of futile searching, the search party returned to the village.</t476>
<t477>In a few weeks, José Arcadio Buendía was completely disheartened.</t477> <t478>He took care of baby Amaranta like a mother.</t478> <t479>He bathed and changed the baby's clothes, and during the day, he took the baby to nurse four times, and at night he sang lullabies to put the baby to sleep, something Úrsula had never done.</t479> <t480>Once, Pilar Ternera volunteered to help with the household chores until Úrsula returned.</t480> <t481>Aureliano, whose strange intuition had already sensed that she was the culprit behind this misfortune, glared at her as she entered.</t481> <t482>Thus, he knew that in whatever form, she was guilty of his brother's departure and his mother's disappearance, and in this way, he silently and resolutely condemned her, causing the woman to no longer dare to set foot in the house.</t482>
<t483>As time passed, everything fell back into place.</t483> <t484>José Arcadio Buendía and his son did not realize when they resumed working in the laboratory, dusting, heating the test tubes, and then becoming engrossed in the preparation of alloys that had lain dormant under a layer of dust for several months.</t484> <t485>Even little Amaranta, snug in her wicker cradle, curiously observed the silent work of her father and brother in the room that had become strange due to the mercury fumes.</t485> <t486>After several months of Úrsula's disappearance, some strange events occurred one day.</t486> <t487>An empty glass jar that had been forgotten on a shelf for a long time suddenly became so heavy that it could not be moved.</t487> <t488>A pot of filtered water placed on the work table, without any fire underneath, suddenly started boiling and within half an hour, all the water had evaporated.</t488> <t489>José Arcadio Buendía and his son were startled by these phenomena and could not explain them, but they insisted that they were omens of the alloy that was about to be created.</t489> <t490>One day, little Amaranta's cradle started spinning on its own and moved around the room, much to the alarm of Aureliano, who rushed to stop it.</t490> <t491>But his father remained calm and unperturbed.</t491> <t492>He placed the cradle back in its original spot and tied it to a table leg, convinced that the long-awaited event was imminent.</t492> <t493>At that moment, Aureliano heard his father say:</t493>
<t494>- If you do not fear God, then fear metal instead!</t494>
<t495>Suddenly, Úrsula returned after nearly five months of being missing.</t495> <t496>She came back looking cheerful, youthful, wearing a dress that was unfamiliar to the villagers.</t496> <t497>José Arcadio Buendía, overwhelmed with joy and sorrow, could hardly resist hugging and kissing her. "Oh my, so that's how it is!", he exclaimed: "I knew it would happen" and he truly believed it, because during his solitary sessions in the room while concocting compounds, from the depths of his heart he had prayed for the eagerly awaited event to occur—not as the perfect result of alchemy, not as liberation from the furnace blowing fire to melt metals, not as the magic to turn the hinges and locks of the house into gold, but as the event that had just happened: Úrsula's return.</t497> <t498>But she did not share her husband's noisy joy.</t498> <t499>She kissed him out of habit as if she had been away for no more than an hour, then told him:</t499>
<t500>- Let's go outside!</t500>
<t501>When he went out and looked at the crowd, José Arcadio Buendía took a long time to come to his senses.</t501> <t502>They were not gypsies.</t502> <t503>They were men and women just like the villagers, with the same soft hair and brown skin, speaking the same language as him and lamenting the same sorrows.</t503> <t504>They brought with them donkeys laden with food, ox carts carrying tables and cooking utensils, which were simple and essential goods sold by vendors without any advertisement.</t504> <t505>They had come from the other side of the swamp, about two days' journey from Macondo, where villages regularly received mail from the post office and were familiar with machines that produced many benefits.</t505> <t506>Úrsula did not catch up with the gypsies, but she found the road that her husband had failed to discover in his unsuccessful quest for great inventions.</t506>
<t507>Chapter 3</t507>
<t508>Pila Tecnêra's son was brought to his grandparents' home two weeks after he was born.</t508><t509>Ursula reluctantly accepted him, as once again she had to yield to her husband's eccentricity, who persistently held the belief that his descendants should not be left to fend for themselves in life. However, she set the condition that the child would never know his true origins.</t509><t510>Although the child was named José Arcadio, the grandparents decided to avoid confusion by calling him simply Arcadio.</t510><t511>At that time, there were many social activities outside the village and a lot of work inside the house, so child care became a secondary concern.</t511><t512>The children were entrusted to Visitación, an indigenous girl who had come to the village with her brother, fleeing a plague of insomnia that had been ravaging their tribe for several years.</t512><t513>Both siblings were gentle, well-behaved, and hardworking, so Ursula trusted them to help with household chores.</t513><t514>Thus, Arcadio and Amaranta spoke the indigenous language before they knew how to speak Spanish, learned to sip lizard soup, and ate spider eggs without Ursula's knowledge, as she was busy with her promising candy animal business.</t514><t515>Macondo had completely changed.</t515><t516>Those who came with Ursula had learned to exploit the fertile land and the advantageous geographical position of Macondo compared to the swampy region. Consequently, the once desolate village quickly became a bustling town with shops, craft workshops, and a regular marketplace where the first Arabs, wearing pantoufles and earrings, came to trade fake crystal beads for long-tailed parrots.</t516><t517>José Arcadio Buendía did not have a moment of rest.</t517>
<t518>Excited by a reality that at this moment seemed more mystical to him than the vast world within his imagination, he lost all interest in his work at the alchemy lab, abandoning the metal substance that had been repeatedly heated and cooled for months to return to his energetic self who once decided to chart roads and build houses so that no one would enjoy more benefits than others.</t518><t519>He had high prestige among the newcomers to the village, to the extent that those who wanted to dig foundations for houses or fence their gardens had to seek his advice first, and he was elected by everyone as the first person to decide on the redistribution of the village's land.</t519><t520>When the gypsies returned with their magic tricks, this time their mobile stall had become a huge shop with games of chance, they were warmly welcomed because people thought that José Arcadio would return with them.</t520><t521>But José Arcadio did not return, and these gypsies did not bring the snake-man, whom Úrsula thought would be the only one who could tell her the truth about her son, so she did not allow the gypsies to stop and open their shop, and in the future, they would not be allowed to set foot in the village because they were condemned as messengers of debauchery and corruption.</t521><t522>However, José Arcadio Buendía showed great insight in thinking that the tribe of Melquíades, with their ancient knowledge and marvelous inventions that had greatly contributed to the growth of Macondo, should always be welcomed with open arms.</t522><t523>But the tribe of Melquíades, according to the words of the wanderers, had been wiped off the face of the earth for daring to surpass the limits of knowledge that God had decreed for mankind.</t523>
<t524>Escaping the torment of illusory desires, at least for the time being, José Arcadio Buendía managed to stabilize the village's way of life with discipline and labor, and allowed the birds that had enlivened the atmosphere with their songs since the village's founding to be released, replacing them with musical clocks installed in homes.</t524> <t525>These were precious clocks made of smoothly planed wood that the Arabs exchanged with the villagers for long-tailed parrots, and José Arcadio Buendía orchestrated them to run so precisely in unison that every half hour, the villagers were cheered by harmonious music that seemed to emanate from a single clock.</t525> <t526>José Arcadio Buendía was the one who, during those years, decided to plant almond trees along the roads instead of acacias, and he was also the one who discovered but never revealed the methods to make them thrive.</t526> <t527>Many years later, when the village of Macondo had become a settlement of wooden houses with tin roofs, the old almond trees still lined the ancient roads, covered in road dust, though by then no one knew who had planted them.</t527> <t528>While the father was busy organizing the communal affairs of the village and the mother was making chicken-shaped candies on sticks to sell at the market twice a day to supplement the family income, Aureliano was passionately absorbed in the abandoned laboratory, studying the craft of goldsmithing.</t528> <t529>He did it purely out of personal interest.</t529> <t530>In a short time, Aureliano grew so much that he could no longer fit into his older brother's clothes and had to wear his father's, but Visitación had to take in the sleeves and narrow the pant legs because he still did not have the robust build of his father and brother.</t530> <t531>Adolescence had taken away Aureliano's sweet voice and made him sullen, quiet, and solitary, but conversely, it had also returned to him the intense expressiveness that he had possessed since birth in his eyes.</t531> <t532>Aureliano was so intensely focused on his goldsmithing experiments that he hardly left the laboratory to eat.</t532> <t533>Worried about his son's extreme intellectual concentration, José Arcadio Buendía gave him the key to the door and some money, thinking that perhaps his son needed the company of a woman.</t533> <t534>But Aureliano used the money to buy hydrochloric acid to create a solution, and he made the keys shine with a layer of gold plating.</t534> <t535>Aureliano's peculiar traits were in harmony with Arcadio and Amaranta, who, though they had lost their baby teeth, still clung to the skirts of the Indian women and stubbornly refused to give up their native language for Spanish. "I have nothing more to complain about," Úrsula said to her husband. "Our children have inherited their parents' madness."</t535> <t536>While she lamented her unfortunate fate, feeling that her sons' eccentricities were indeed as terrifying as a pig's tail, Aureliano dreamily watched her:</t536>
<t537>- Someone will come to our house! - he told his mother.</t537>
<t538>Because you have often talked about omens, Ucsula, with her common sense, intended to dampen your spirits.</t538> <t539>Visitors to the house are a normal occurrence.</t539> <t540>Dozens of strangers pass through the village of Macondo without surprising anyone or announcing any secret.</t540> <t541>However, despite those common sense arguments, Aureliano still insisted on his prediction:</t541>
<t542>- I don't know who it is? - he said, - but the person coming here is currently on their way.</t542>
<t543>Indeed, Rebecca arrived on a Sunday.</t543> <t544>The little girl was not yet eleven years old.</t544> <t545>She had to struggle to travel from Manaure to here with the fur traders who were tasked with delivering her and the letter to José Arcadio Buendía's house, but even these traders could not clearly explain who had asked them to do so.</t545> <t546>All of her belongings consisted of a small trunk containing clothes, a wooden rocking chair, and a burlap sack in which her parents' bones were kept, which would often clatter, clatter, clatter when they bumped into each other.</t546> <t547>The letter addressed to José Arcadio Buendía was written with affectionate words expressing the feelings of someone who, despite being separated for a long time, still loved him and, out of a very close affection, felt obliged to ask his family to take care of this orphaned girl with no place to go. It mentioned that the girl was a close relative of Úrsula and thus also somewhat related to José Arcadio Buendía, though a bit more distantly, because she was the daughter of an unforgettable friend named Nicanor Ulloa and his noble wife named Rebecca Montiel.</t547> <t548>These are the people who are now under God's protection in His paradise, and their bones have been collected so that his family could bury them in the graveyard of Christ's flock.</t548>
<t549>The names mentioned as signatures in the letter were completely clear, but neither José Arcadio Buendía nor Úrsula remembered knowing anyone with those names, including the sender of the letter, and in the distant village of Manaure, there couldn't possibly be anyone with those names.</t549> <t550>Through the little girl, they also couldn't find any more detailed information.</t550> <t551>Since her arrival, the little girl sat on the rocking chair, sucking her thumb and with wide, fearful eyes, observing everyone, without showing whether she understood or didn't understand what people were asking her.</t551> <t552>The little girl wore a black-striped, worn-out diagonal fabric dress and varnished boots with holes, her hair tucked behind her ears with black ribbons.</t552> <t553>She also wore a sleeveless embroidered cloak, faded by sweat, and on her right wrist, she wore a wild animal's tooth set in a bronze base, which seemed like a protective amulet.</t553> <t554>Her skin was pale green, her belly round and swollen like a drum, all indicating that she was very sickly and had been starving for a long time.</t554> <t555>But when given food, she sat still, placed the bowl on her lap, and didn't taste it at all.</t555> <t556>Everyone assumed she was mute and deaf until the Indians asked her in their native language if she wanted water, and her eyes blinked as if she understood them, and she nodded to ask for water.</t556>
<t557>There was no other way, so the family had to adopt the little girl.</t557><t558>Everyone decided to call her Rebecca to match her mother's name because Aureliano had patiently sat in front of her reading all the saint names, but he didn't see any reaction, not even the slightest, on the girl's face.</t558><t559>At that time, the village of Macondo didn't have a cemetery, because until then, no one had died, so the family had to keep the sack containing the remains until there was a proper place for burial.</t559><t560>For quite a long time, they were scattered everywhere, found in the most unexpected places, often accompanied by the squawking of a scratching chicken.</t560><t561>It took a long time for Rebecca to get used to life in this house.</t561><t562>She sat on the rocking chair, sucking her thumb in the loneliest corner of the house.</t562><t563>Only the music from the clock caught her attention.</t563><t564>Every half hour, with startled eyes, she listened as if waiting for that music from some windy place.</t564><t565>For several days, the family couldn't get her to eat.</t565><t566>No one could understand how she didn't starve to death until the Indians, who knew everything because they quietly moved around the house, discovered that Rebecca didn't like to eat rice but instead liked to eat moist earth from the yard and wall soil that she scraped off with her fingers.</t566><t567>It was clear that her parents or whoever raised her had scolded her for this bad habit, so she ate secretly, fully aware that it was a wrongdoing.</t567><t568>She would sneak pieces of wall soil to eat when no one was looking.</t568><t569>From then on, people paid more attention to her.</t569><t570>They poured cow bile on the yard and smeared chili water on the walls, believing that these methods could curb the dangerous habit.</t570><t571>But the girl was clever and skillfully found ways to hide the soil to eat, forcing Ursula to use even more effective measures.</t571><t572>She mixed orange juice with rhubarb powder in a jar and left it out overnight, and the next morning at breakfast, she gave the girl a cup of it.</t572><t573>Even though no one told her that this was a special remedy for eating soil, she thought that any bitter liquid on an empty stomach would affect the liver.</t573><t574>Despite having rickets, Rebecca was so fierce and strong that they had to pin her down like a calf to give her the medicine, and they could hardly restrain her kicking legs or cover her mouth to stop the incomprehensible sounds accompanied by scratching and spitting, which, according to the Indians, were the most obscene words in their language.</t574><t575>Knowing this, Ursula had to resort to using a whip while giving her the medicine.</t575><t576>It will never be determined whether it was the rhubarb powder or the whippings, or both combined, that proved effective, but the fact was that within a few weeks, Rebecca began to show signs of recovery.</t576><t577>Rebecca joined the games of Arcadio and Amaranta, who welcomed her as an older sister, and she ate heartily, skillfully using the utensils.</t577><t578>She also quickly demonstrated that she spoke Spanish as fluently as the Indian language and had a knack for manual labor.</t578><t579>She sang along with the waltz music from the clock, improvising beautiful lyrics.</t579><t580>Soon, she was accepted as another member of the family.</t580><t581>Ursula loved her more than her own children, and the girl called Amaranta and Arcadio her siblings, Aureliano her uncle, and José Arcadio Buendía her grandfather.</t581>
<t582>So in the end, the girl truly deserved to bear the name Rebeca Buendía, a unique name of hers, and she proudly carried it throughout her life until her last breath.</t582>
<t583>One night, during the period when Rebecca was cured of her habit of eating dirt and was moved to sleep in the same room as the other children, the Indian girl who usually slept in the same room with them suddenly woke up and heard an unusual noise.</t583> <t584>The girl startled and sat up, thinking that some animal had entered the room, and at that moment she saw Rebecca sitting on the rocking chair, sucking her thumb with eyes shining like a cat's in the dark night.</t584>
<t585>Panic-stricken by the dangerous disease, worried about the misfortune of her fate, Visitacion recognized in those eyes the symptoms of an illness whose threat had forced them, her and her brother, to forever bid farewell to the ancient kingdom where they had once been princess and prince.</t585> <t586>It was the insomnia plague.</t586>
<t587>Cataurê, Visitaxiôn's brother, ran away from home that night.</t587><t588>His sister stayed because her fateful heart had told her that the deadly dangerous disease would follow her to the ends of the earth.</t588><t589>No one understood Visitaxiôn's anxiety.</t589><t590>"If we can't sleep, all the better," José Arcadio Buendía said cheerfully, "that way life will be more useful to us."</t590><t591>But the Indian girl explained to them that the most frightening thing about insomnia was not the inability to sleep, because the body does not feel tired, but that if not treated in time, it would certainly lead to an even more serious disease, which is amnesia.</t591><t592>That is, when the patient gets used to the state of insomnia, childhood memories will be erased from his mind, then the names and meanings of things, and finally his own identity and even the awareness of himself, will be erased from his memory, leaving everything to sink into an unprecedented state of idiocy. José Arcadio Buendía, feeling like laughing to death, remarked that the girl was talking about one of those diseases caused by the superstitions of the Indians.</t592><t593>However, Úrsula, to be safe, carefully isolated Rebeca from the children.</t593><t594>Weeks later, when Visitaxiôn's anxiety had subsided, José Arcadio Buendía spent a restless night in bed, unable to sleep.</t594><t595>Úrsula, who had also woken up, asked him what was wrong, and he replied, "Once again, I am thinking about Prudencio Aguilar, my dear."</t595><t596>Neither of the couple slept a minute, but the next day they felt so healthy that they forgot about the sleepless night.</t596><t597>At lunchtime, Aureliano startled everyone by saying that he felt fine even though he had stayed up all night gilding a hair clip, a gift he planned to give his mother for her birthday.</t597><t598>No one in the family showed any concern until the third day, at bedtime, when they still did not feel sleepy, and only then did everyone realize that they had not slept for more than fifty hours.</t598>
<t599>- The children are as alert as larks, - the Indian girl said with a firm belief in the unavoidable fate.</t599> <t600>- Once the epidemic spreads, no one can escape.</t600>
<t601>Indeed, the insomnia epidemic had spread to this place.</t601><t602>Thanks to learning from her mother, Ucsula knew about some plants with healing properties. She crushed the leaves of the aconite plant to extract the juice for everyone to drink, but it was ineffective; no one could sleep, and instead, everyone spent the entire day dreaming while awake.</t602><t603>In that state of wakeful dreaming, not only did people see the figures from their own dreams, but they also saw the figures from others' dreams.</t603><t604>It was as if the house was crowded with guests.</t604><t605>Sitting on the rocking chair placed in the kitchen corner, Rebecca dreamed of a man who looked very much like her, dressed in white linen clothes, with a gold button at his collar, bringing her a rose branch.</t605><t606>A woman with delicate hands walking beside him plucked a rose and pinned it in the girl's hair.</t606><t607>Ucsula understood that they were Rebecca's parents, but despite her efforts to recognize them, she had to admit that she had never seen them before.</t607><t608>Meanwhile, due to an unfortunate oversight that José Arcadio Buendía would never forgive himself for: the animal-shaped candies produced in the house continued to be sold at the market.</t608><t609>Children and adults delighted in sucking on the green chicken-shaped candies that had caught the insomnia, the pink fish-shaped candies that had caught the insomnia, the yellow horse-shaped candies that had caught the insomnia, so the dawn of the second day found the entire village awake.</t609><t610>At first, no one panicked.</t610><t611>On the contrary, everyone was delighted to be unable to sleep, because there was so much work to be done that they hardly had enough time.</t611><t612>They worked so much that soon there was nothing left to do, and at three in the morning, they all sat with folded arms, counting each chime from the clocks.</t612><t613>Those who wanted to sleep, not because they felt tired but because they missed their usual sleep, tried every necessary method to bring sleep to themselves, but all were ineffective.</t613><t614>They gathered to chat endlessly, to repeat a single funny story for hours and hours, to drive everyone crazy with the story of the Capon chicken, which was a never-ending game where the storyteller would ask if the listeners wanted to hear the story of the Capon chicken, and when they answered yes, he would say he didn't ask them to say yes but if they wanted to hear the story of the Capon chicken, and when they answered no, he would say he didn't ask them to say no but if they wanted to hear the story of the Capon chicken, and when they stayed silent, he would say he didn't ask them to stay silent but if they wanted to hear the story of the Capon chicken, and no one could leave because the storyteller would say he didn't ask them to leave but if they wanted to hear the story of the Capon chicken, and so it went on in a vicious cycle throughout the long nights.</t614>
<t615>When José Arcadio Buendía realized that the epidemic had spread throughout the village, he gathered the household heads to explain the insomnia disease as he understood it.</t615> <t616>The household heads unanimously agreed to take the necessary measures to prevent this calamity from spreading to other residents in the swamp area.</t616> <t617>So, they removed the small bells from the goats' necks that the Arabs had brought here in exchange for long-tailed parrots and placed them at the village gate, ready for those who ignored the gatekeeper's earnest warnings and pleas and insisted on visiting the village of Macondo.</t617> <t618>All strangers walking the streets of Macondo during that time had to ring the bells to inform the sick that they were healthy.</t618> <t619>During their stay, they were not allowed to eat or drink anything because it was beyond doubt that the disease spread through the mouth, and moreover, all food and drink had been contaminated with insomnia.</t619> <t620>In this way, the epidemic was confined within the village's boundaries.</t620> <t621>This decisive measure was the one used during the quarantine period, and it was maintained until the state of insomnia was considered a normal phenomenon, and life was organized so that business regained its usual rhythm, and no one had to worry about sleeping, considering it a useless habit.</t621>
<t622>Aureliano was the first person to find a remedy for memory loss.</t622> <t623>He discovered it by chance.</t623> <t624>As the person who had suffered from insomnia the longest in the village, he had trained to achieve a high level of skill in the craft of goldsmithing.</t624> <t625>One day, he was looking for a small anvil to thin metal and suddenly forgot where it was.</t625>
<t626>Your father told you to call it a tas.</t626> <t627>Aureliano immediately wrote the word tas on a piece of paper and stuck it on the anvil stand.</t627> <t628>That way, he believed he would not forget its name in the future.</t628> <t629>He did not realize that forgetting the name was the first sign of amnesia, but simply thought it was because the tool had a very difficult name to remember.</t629> <t630>But a few days later, he discovered that he could not remember the names of the tools in the laboratory.</t630> <t631>So he wrote their names on each object, so just reading the name would allow him to recognize them.</t631> <t632>When his father shared his worry about forgetting all the deep memories from his childhood, Aureliano explained his method to him, and José Arcadio Buendía then applied this method to everyone in the house, and later to all the villagers.</t632> <t633>Using a branch dipped in ink, he wrote the name of each object: table, chair, clock, door, wall, bed, frying pan.</t633> <t634>Then he went to the garden and wrote on each animal and plant: cow, goat, pig, hen, cassava, taro, plantain.</t634> <t635>By exploring the infinite possibilities of amnesia, he gradually realized that a day might come when people would recognize objects by their written names but would not remember their uses in life.</t635> <t636>So it was necessary to write more clearly.</t636> <t637>The sign hanging on the cow's neck was a typical example of how the people of Macondo used this method to combat amnesia. This is a cow; every morning it must be milked, and the milk must be boiled to mix with coffee to make coffee with milk.</t637> <t638>Thus, the villagers lived in a slippery reality that could not be etched into memory, fleetingly recognized by the words written on paper but disappearing when the meanings of the words were forgotten.</t638>
<t639>Right at the entrance to the village of Macondo, a sign was erected that read: Macondo, and on the central road of the village, an even larger sign was erected that said "God Exists".</t639><t640>To remember objects as well as human emotions, signs were hung in houses labeling each object and each type of emotion.</t640><t641>But this memory system required so much observation and mental effort that many people surrendered to the joy of an imaginary world, one they themselves invented, which was more of a world of consolation than a world of action for them.</t641><t642>Pilar Ternera contributed significantly to the spread of this deception when she sensed how to read the past in the cards, just as she had previously read the future through them.</t642><t643>Using this method, the insomniacs began to live in a world constructed of vague, uncertain images in the cards, where the father almost remembered himself as a tanned man who had just arrived here at the beginning of April, and the mother almost remembered herself as a young woman with jet-black hair, still wearing a gold label on her left hand, and where a birthday seemed to have just been celebrated last Tuesday, with the lark's song still echoing in the laurel tree.</t643><t644>Defeated by these comforting tricks, José Arcadio Buendía resolved to create a memory machine he had always wished for, to remember the marvelous inventions of the gypsies.</t644><t645>Every morning, this machine was supposed to be capable of reviewing all the knowledge acquired in life from beginning to end.</t645><t646>He imagined it as a self-rotating dictionary that a person sitting at the axis, using a crank, could make the knowledge of life appear before their eyes in just a few hours.</t646><t647>He wrote fourteen thousand index cards.</t647><t648>At that very moment, on the road from the swamp to the village, an eccentric old man appeared, holding a small bell that rang with the sad sound of a sleepy person, carrying a bulging suitcase tied carefully with ropes, pushing a small cart covered with dark patches of cloth.</t648><t649>He went straight to the house of José Arcadio Buendía.</t649>
<t650>When she opened the door for the old man, Visitacion did not recognize him and thought that the old man had come to sell something, not knowing that it was impossible to sell anything in this village, which was mired in a terrible, incurable disease of forgetfulness.</t650> <t651>He was a very elderly man.</t651> <t652>Although his voice was hoarse and intermittent, and his hands trembled as if denying the existence of objects, it was clear that he came from a land where people could still sleep and remember.</t652> <t653>Jose Arcadio Buendia found him sitting in the living room; fanning himself with a patched-up hat, his eyes engrossed in reading the handwritten papers pasted on the walls.</t653> <t654>He greeted the old man respectfully to avoid being rude, fearing that it might be an old acquaintance he had not seen in a long time and did not currently recognize.</t654> <t655>But the guest realized that he was not sincere.</t655> <t656>The old man felt forgotten by the host, but it was not a forgetfulness born of carelessness; it was a malicious and incurable forgetfulness due to an inability to concentrate memory, a forgetfulness he knew very well because it was the forgetfulness of death.</t656>
<t657>The old man opened the suitcase packed with indispensable items, then he took out a bag containing bottles. He gave José Arcadio Buendía a drink of a pleasantly scented liquid, and immediately his memory brightened.</t657> <t658>Tears blurred his eyes before he could see that he was in a room cluttered with labeled objects, before he could feel ashamed of the foolish things written on the walls with all sincerity and more, before he realized who the newcomer was in the fresh light of hope.</t658> <t659>That person was Melquíades.</t659>
<t660>While Macondo was celebrating the recovery of its memory, José Arcadio Buendía and Melquíades rekindled their old friendship, which had long been covered in the dust of time.</t660> <t661>The gypsy decided to stay in the village.</t661> <t662>Indeed, he had been in the realm of the dead and had fled back here because he could no longer bear the loneliness.</t662> <t663>Abandoned by his tribe, stripped of his supernatural powers, all of this seemed like a punishment for his loyalty to life. He had resolved to flee to this corner of the world, unnoticed by death, and devoted himself to the profession of daguerreotype photography.</t663> <t664>José Arcadio Buendía had never heard of this invention.</t664> <t665>But when he saw himself and his family eternally captured on a shimmering metal plate, he stood there in a daze.</t665> <t666>A photograph from that time, now tarnished, still exists, showing José Arcadio Buendía with graying curly hair, a brass button fastening the collar of his shirt, and an expression of solemn fear that made Úrsula laugh and describe him as "a terrified general."</t666> <t667>Indeed, José Arcadio Buendía was terrified on that December morning when the photograph was taken, because he thought that people would gradually disappear as his image appeared on the metal plate.</t667> <t668>By a strange reversal of habits, it was Úrsula who had planted this idea in his mind, and she, who had forgotten her previous discomforts, agreed to let Melquíades stay in their house, although she never allowed him to photograph her because (as she said) she did not want to exist in such a way to mock her grandchildren.</t668>
<t669>That morning, she dressed beautifully to visit the children, applied powder to them, and then gave each one a spoonful of marrow porridge so they could stand still for two minutes in front of Menkyadet's camera.</t669> <t670>In the photograph of the long-lost family, Aureliano, dressed in black wool, stood between Amaranta and Rebeca.</t670> <t671>He bore a melancholic look and sharp eyes that, many years later, remained unchanged when he faced the firing squad; at that time, he still had no premonition of his fate.</t671> <t672>He had become a skilled jeweler admired throughout the region.</t672> <t673>In the workshop, which was set up alongside Menkyadet's noisy laboratory, it seemed as if he had escaped into another era to work to the point where he could no longer hear himself breathe; meanwhile, his father and Menkyadet loudly debated Nostradamus's prophecies.</t673>
<t674>The words echoed amidst the clinking of bottles and cups containing solutions, and the misfortune of spilled acid and scattered silver spoons caused by occasional elbow bumps and slips.</t674> <t675>The wholehearted dedication to work, the correct concept guiding all his interests, had allowed him in a short time to earn a sum of money larger than what Ursula had earned from her delicious animal-shaped candies, but everyone was surprised that although he was already a grown man, he still hadn't known a woman.</t675> <t676>In truth, he had never been with anyone.</t676>
<t677>A few months later, old Francisco - The Man, a nearly two-hundred-year-old wanderer who often passed through Macondo to spread songs he composed himself, returned to the village.</t677> <t678>In these songs, old Francisco - The Man recounted in detail the events that happened along his journeys, from the village of Manaure to the remotest corners of the swampy regions, so if anyone wanted to send a message or announce an event, they could pay him two cents to include it in his program.</t678> <t679>Thanks to this, one night Úrsula listened to his songs with the hope that they would mention José Arcadio, and she accidentally learned of her mother's passing.</t679> <t680>He was called Francisco - The Man because in a singing contest he had defeated the devil, and besides, no one knew his real name.</t680> <t681>During the insomnia epidemic that plagued the village of Macondo, he quietly disappeared, and now, without any prior notice, he was back in Catarino's store. The whole village flocked to hear him to see what new things had happened in the world.</t681> <t682>On this occasion, accompanying him was a fat woman sitting on a rocking chair carried by four Indian porters, with a lonely-looking mixed-race girl holding an umbrella to shade her.</t682> <t683>That night, Aureliano went to Catarino's store. He saw old Francisco - The Man, like a petrified chameleon, sitting among the curious crowd listening to his tales...</t683> <t684>With a wheezing voice accompanied by an old accordion, which had been given to him by Mr. Oante Rahch on the island of Goadana.</t684> <t685>He sang to tell the news, while his large, rough, cracked feet from walking through sulfur mines kept stomping to keep the rhythm.</t685> <t686>The madam sat on a rocking chair, fanning herself at the back door where some men were coming and going.</t686> <t687>With a felt rose tucked behind his ear, Catarino sold glasses of guarapo - nearly everyone placed their hands on him right where they shouldn't.</t687> <t688>As the night wore on, the heat became unbearable.</t688> <t689>Aureliano sat and listened to the news until the end of the program but found nothing useful for his family.</t689> <t690>As he was preparing to go home, the madam pointed her finger, signaling to him:</t690>
<t691>- You should come in too, - she said, - it only costs two hào!</t691>
<t692>Aureliano put two dimes into the dish the woman held at her side and then stepped into the room without knowing what to do.</t692> <t693>The mixed-race girl was lying naked on the bed with breasts that looked like a dog's.</t693> <t694>That night, before Aureliano entered, sixty-three men had already passed through this room.</t694> <t695>The air in the room, thickened by the sweat and breath of so many people, had started to condense into a muddy substance.</t695> <t696>The girl stripped the soaking wet bed sheet and asked Aureliano to hold one end.</t696> <t697>It was extremely heavy.</t697> <t698>The two of them twisted the ends of the sheet until it was wrung dry.</t698> <t699>They tilted the bed, and sweat streamed down the tilted side, dripping onto the floor.</t699> <t700>Aureliano fervently wished that this task would never end.</t700> <t701>In theory, he knew the art of lovemaking, but his knees were weak, and despite his skin being covered in goosebumps and feeling feverish, he couldn't suppress the urgent need to pass gas.</t701> <t702>When the bed was made, the girl ordered him to undress, and he clumsily explained, "They told me to come in.</t702> <t703>They told me to put two dimes in the money dish and not to delay."</t703> <t704>The girl understood his anxiety. "If you put two more dimes at the exit, you can stay a few more minutes," she said gently.</t704>
<t705>Aureliano undressed, looking miserable with shame, unable to shake off the thought that his naked body could not compare to his brother's robust physique.</t705><t706>Despite the girl's attempts to be seductive, he still felt lonely, terribly lonely.</t706><t707>"I'll add two more cents," he said in a dejected voice.</t707><t708>The girl quietly thanked him.</t708><t709>Her back was bright red.</t709><t710>Her skin clung to her bones, revealing each rib, and her breath was rapid and erratic, full of exhaustion.</t710><t711>Two years ago, in a distant village, the girl had fallen asleep without extinguishing a candle, and when she awoke, she was right next to the fire.</t711><t712>The house where she lived with her grandmother, who had raised her since she was a baby, had turned to ashes.</t712><t713>Since then, her grandmother had taken her from village to village, forcing her to sleep with men for two cents each time to save up enough to compensate for the value of the burned house.</t713><t714>According to the girl's calculations, she still had more than ten years to go, offering herself every night to seventy men, because besides paying her grandmother, she also had to earn enough to cover travel expenses, food for both of them, and wages for the Indians who carried the rocking chair.</t714><t715>When the madam knocked on the door for the second time, Aureliano left the room without having done anything, feeling so pained he wanted to cry.</t715><t716>That night, he did not sleep, only thinking about the girl with a mix of love and pity.</t716><t717>He felt both love and a desire to protect the girl.</t717><t718>It was an intense feeling that could not be stopped.</t718><t719>At dawn, exhausted from lack of sleep and fever, he made a healthy decision: he would marry the girl to free her from her grandmother's control and to enjoy with her the nights of pleasure she had to share with seventy men.</t719><t720>But at ten in the morning, when he arrived at Catarino's store, the girl had already left the village.</t720>
<t721>Time gradually soothed Auréliano's naive intentions, but it deepened his sense of failure.</t721><t722>He buried himself in work.</t722><t723>He resolved to remain single for life, to bury the shameful thought of considering himself useless.</t723><t724>Meanwhile, Melquíades had finished recording on his films everything that could be captured in the village of Macondo and had left the darkroom to the passions of José Arcadio Buendía, who had decided to use it for a scientific experiment to prove the existence of God.</t724><t725>Through a complex process of presenting photographs taken at different locations in the house, he was convinced that sooner or later there would be a photograph of God, if God indeed existed, and at the same time, it would end all speculation about His existence.</t725><t726>Melquíades delved deeper into the teachings of Nostradamus.</t726><t727>He worked until dusk, suffocating in his faded felt coat, with his tiny sparrow-like hands, the rings on his fingers having lost their luster from times past, scribbling on sheets of paper.</t727><t728>One night, he thought he had found a prophecy about the future of Macondo.</t728><t729>It could become a radiant city, with enormous crystal buildings, where there would be no trace of the Buendía lineage.</t729><t730>"That is a mistake," José Arcadio Buendía angrily said.</t730><t731>"Those are not crystal buildings, but ice buildings, as I have seen in my dreams, and no matter how many centuries pass, there will always be a Buendía."</t731><t732>In that bizarre house, Úrsula was the one trying to maintain a normal atmosphere by expanding the business of making candy figurines, with an oven that in one night produced baskets and baskets of bread, and batches of puddings, cakes, and biscuits that within a few hours spread throughout the paths of the swampy region.</t732><t733>Though she was of an age to rest, she became even more active.</t733><t734>So busy with these profitable tasks, that one afternoon, while the Indian girl helping her mixed honey into the dough, she looked out into the yard and saw two beautiful, unfamiliar young women sitting and embroidering under the sunset light.</t734><t735>They were Rebeca and Amaranta.</t735><t736>They had just finished mourning their grandmother, a mourning they had persistently observed for three long years, and now their colorful clothes seemed to place them in a new phase of life.</t736>
<t737>Completely contrary to what might await her in the future, Rebecca was the most beautiful girl.</t737> <t738>She had skin as white as celery, large and deep eyes, and dexterous hands that seemed to be weaving invisible threads on an embroidered tapestry.</t738> <t739>Amaranta, the younger girl, though slightly less graceful, had a natural elegance, an inner tranquility inherited from her late grandmother.</t739> <t740>Beside the two girls was Arcadio.</t740> <t741>Despite having inherited his father's stature, Arcadio was still just a little boy.</t741> <t742>He decided to learn the trade of a jeweler under the guidance of Aureliano, who, besides teaching the trade, also taught the boy to read and write.</t742> <t743>Immediately, Ursula realized that her house would soon be cramped, that her children were of marriageable age and would have children of their own, and due to lack of space, they would be forced to scatter.</t743> <t744>So she took the money she had saved over many years of hard work, made contracts with her clients, and began expanding the house.</t744>
<t745>She decided to build two living rooms, one of which would be fully equipped and more airy for daily use, and a dining room large enough to accommodate a big dining table with twelve seats for family and guests to dine together, nine bedrooms all with windows opening to the yard, and a long corridor with balconies holding pots of ferns and begonias, outside of which was a rose garden shielding from the harsh midday sun.</t745> <t746>She also decided to demolish the old kitchen to build two ovens; to dismantle the old corn warehouse where Pila Tecnêra had read José Arcadio's fortune through the cards, to construct a new warehouse twice as large, sufficient to store food supplies for many years.</t746> <t747>She decided to erect a male bathhouse and a female bathhouse, and at the end of the yard, a large stable, a chicken coop with wire mesh, a milking barn, and an aviary with open doors to welcome birds that could freely come and go. Followed by dozens of carpenters and masons, as if she had caught her husband's gold fever, Úrsula arranged the positions for light and ventilation, dividing the spaces without forgetting their boundaries.</t747> <t748>The house, originally built by the pioneering ancestors, suddenly became crowded with saws, chisels, and construction materials, and the tired, sweaty workers were asking everyone else not to disturb the objects, unaware that they themselves were the ones causing all the disruption.</t748> <t749>They went mad because of the bag of human bones that rattled, clattering everywhere they went.</t749> <t750>In the unpleasant scene of having to breathe the strong smell of lime and tar, no one understood why a house was rising from the ground, not only larger than any seen in the village but also the most hospitable and coolest ever in the entire swamp region.</t750> <t751>José Arcadio Buendía, who thought he would astonish the Almighty with the great changes, was the one who understood it the least.</t751> <t752>When the house was nearly complete, Úrsula pulled him out of his dream world to inform him that there was an order requiring the front walls of all houses to be painted blue instead of white, as the villagers preferred.</t752> <t753>She showed him the paper with the official order written on it.</t753> <t754>José Arcadio Buendía, still not understanding what his wife was saying, was trying to read the signature:</t754>
<t755>- Who is this person? - He asked.</t755>
<t756>- That's the inspector, - Ursula replied sadly.</t756> <t757>- People say that he is a new official sent by the government.</t757>
<t758>Apollinar Moscote, the magistrate, quietly arrived in the village of Macondo.</t758> <t759>He got off the vehicle and stayed at the Jacob Hotel, established by one of the first Arabs who came here to trade goods for long-tailed parrots.</t759> <t760>The next day, he rented a room that opened onto the street, just two blocks away from Buendía's house.</t760> <t761>He set up a table and a chair bought from Jacob, hung the national emblem he had brought with him on the wall, and placed a sign on the door that read: Magistrate.</t761> <t762>His first order of business was to instruct the houses in the village to be whitewashed in celebration of Independence Day. José Arcadio Buendía, holding a copy of the order, found him napping in a hammock strung up in a sparsely furnished and decorated room.</t762> <t763>"Are you the one who wrote this paper?" he asked.</t763> <t764>Apollinar Moscote, a mature man with a timid demeanor and a flushed face, replied that he was. "In the name of what did you write this?" José Arcadio Buendía continued to ask.</t764>
<t765>Đông Apôlina Môscôtê found a piece of paper stored in the desk drawer and showed it to him: "I have just been appointed as the Inspector of this village".</t765> <t766>Hôsê Accađiô Buênđya didn't bother to look at the appointment letter, and said:</t766>
<t767>- In this village, we do not issue orders with paperwork - he said calmly, - and just so you know, we do not need any Inspector, because there is nothing here that needs inspecting.</t767>
<t768>Faced with the firm attitude of Don Apolinar Moscote, who never raised his voice, José Arcadio Buendía recounted in detail how they had built the village, how they had divided the land, how they had opened roads, and how they had developed the necessary and profitable trades for life, without ever bothering the government and without anyone ever bothering the villagers.</t768>
<t769>"We live so peacefully that our village has never had anyone die from illness or old age," he said. "You see, our village doesn't even have a cemetery yet!"</t769> <t770>He was not at all distressed that the government had not helped the villagers.</t770> <t771>On the contrary, he was pleased to see that up to this point, the government had allowed the villagers to continue living that way, because they did not waste their efforts establishing the village only for others to come and tell them what to do. Don Apolinar Moscote, wearing a twill fabric coat as white as his trousers, never lost his calm demeanor.</t771>
<t772>- So if you want to stay here, like other ordinary residents, you will be warmly welcomed, - José Arcadio Buendía concluded, - otherwise, if you have come to cause trouble and force the villagers to whitewash their walls, you can pack your bags and go back to where you came from.</t772> <t773>Because my house must be as white as a dove.</t773>
<t774>Don Apolinar Moscote turned pale. He took a step back, gritting his teeth with an embarrassed look, and said:</t774>
<t775>- I inform you that I have a weapon.</t775>
<t776>José Arcadio Buendía did not know since when the strength of a young man capable of breaking a bull's horn had concentrated entirely in his hands.</t776> <t777>Grabbing Apolinar Moscote by the lapels of his cotton jacket, he lifted him to eye level and said:</t777>
<t778>- I'll do this, - he said, - because I want to carry it alive and not have to regret for the rest of my life carrying a dead body.</t778>
<t779>He kept carrying him along the main road until his hand got tired and he let go of the lapel, then he set him down.</t779> <t780>At that moment, the Inspector was already on the road outside the marsh.</t780> <t781>A week later, he returned with six barefoot soldiers, all dressed in rags, each carrying a musket, and an ox cart carrying his wife and seven daughters.</t781> <t782>After that, two more ox carts arrived carrying beds, chairs, tables, cabinets, trunks, and kitchen utensils.</t782> <t783>He lodged his family at the Jacob Hotel while looking to buy a house and resumed his office with guards outside.</t783>
<t784>The founders of the village of Macondo were ready to expel the invaders.</t784> <t785>Together with their grown sons, they came to support the determination of José Arcadio Buendía.</t785>
<t786>But he objected because, as he explained, Apôhna Môscôtê had returned here with his wife and daughters, and as a man, one should not embarrass another in front of their family.</t786> <t787>So he decided to handle the matter in a more amicable manner.</t787>
<t788>Aureliano went with him.</t788> <t789>At this time, he had a black mustache that curled up at the ends and a booming voice, which later became distinguishing features that made him stand out in the war.</t789> <t790>Without carrying any weapons and not obeying the guards' orders, the father and son walked straight into the Inspector's office.</t790>
<t791>Don Apolinar Moscote remained calm.</t791> <t792>He introduced to them his two daughters who happened to be there.</t792> <t793>Amparo, sixteen years old, with tanned skin like her mother's, and Remedios, approximately nine years old, a charming little girl with ivory skin and blue eyes.</t793> <t794>Both were graceful and well-mannered.</t794> <t795>As swiftly as they had entered, before being introduced by their father, the girls had already brought chairs for the guests to sit on.</t795> <t796>But both father and daughters remained standing.</t796>
<t797>- Very well? - José Arcadio Buendía said. - You will stay here, but not because you have those guards with muskets, but because of the villagers' respect for your wife and these young ladies.</t797>
<t798>Apollinar Moscote was bewildered, but José Arcadio Buendía did not give him time to respond: "We only ask two things of you," he said. "First, let each person paint their house as they wish.</t798> <t799>Second, let the soldiers leave the village immediately.</t799> <t800>We will ensure your safety."</t800> <t801>The inspector spread out his right hand and raised it:</t801>
<t802>- A promise of honor?</t802>
<t803>- Those are the words of an enemy, - José Arcadio Buendía said.</t803> <t804>But with a bitter tone, he clarified:</t804>
<t805>- Because I want to make it clear for you to know: You and I will continue to be enemies.</t805>
<t806>That very afternoon, the soldiers had to leave in a hurry.</t806> <t807>A few days later, José Arcadio Buendía found a house for the Inspector's family.</t807> <t808>Everyone lived peacefully, except for Aureliano. The image of Remedios, the Inspector's youngest daughter, who by age could have been his own child, lingered painfully in his mind.</t808> <t809>It was a mechanical sensation, like a pebble in a shoe that hurts the foot with every step.</t809>
<t810>Chapter 4</t810>
<t811>A dance party was organized to celebrate the new house, white as a dove.</t811> <t812>Ursula had cherished that idea ever since the afternoon she saw Rebeca and Amaranta had become young ladies, and it could almost be said that the main reason for building the new house was the desire to provide the girls with a worthy place to receive guests.</t812> <t813>While carrying out the reconstruction of the house, Ursula toiled like a convict so that no obstacle could extinguish that brilliant, radiant purpose.</t813>
<t814>Therefore, before these tasks were completed, she had already sent for the purchase of decorations and food containers, all of which were expensive items.</t814> <t815>Among them was a marvelous object that had astonished the entire village and delighted the youth, which was the automatic piano.</t815> <t816>People transported its parts to the house.</t816> <t817>These parts were placed in several crates and were unpacked along with furniture made in Vienna, mirrors produced in Bohemia, dishes from the West Indies Company, Dutch tablecloths, and a series of oil lamps and candles, vases, floral silk wall hangings, and carpets.</t817> <t818>The import company had sent an experienced Italian specialist named Pietro Crespi to the house to assemble and tune the automatic piano, to teach the buyers how to use it, and especially to instruct them in dancing to the fashionable music printed on six rolls of tape.</t818>
<t819>Piêtrô Crêspi was a young man with red hair, one of the most handsome and educated individuals in Macondo, who took such pride in his appearance that, despite the sweltering heat, he always wore a tight-fitting silk suit and a thick woolen overcoat.</t819><t820>Sweating profusely, trying to maintain a clear distance from his hosts, he stayed for several weeks in a closed room, with a passion identical to Aureliano's in the jewelry workshop.</t820><t821>One morning, without opening the door, without calling upon any divine witness, he placed a music roll in the automatic piano, and pure, melodious music began to play, causing the harsh hammering and constant clattering of the wooden planks to suddenly cease in the startling silence.</t821><t822>Everyone hurriedly rushed to the living room.</t822><t823>José Arcadio Buendía became excited not because of the enchanting beauty of the music but because the automatic piano was playing the keys by itself, and he placed Melquiades' camera in the living room, hoping to capture a photograph of the invisible musician.</t823><t824>That day, the Italian maestro had lunch with the family.</t824><t825>Rebeca and Amaranta, who were serving, were both charmed by the gentle and graceful demeanor of the refined man as his ringless, pale green hands handled the silverware at the table.</t825><t826>In the dining room connected to the living room, Piêtrô Crêspi taught the two girls to dance.</t826><t827>Keeping time with a metronome, he taught them to move their feet without touching their bodies, under the endearing supervision of Úrsula, who never left the living room while her daughters were learning to dance.</t827><t828>During those days, Piêtrô Crêspi wore special, soft, tight-fitting clothes and a pair of dancing shoes.</t828><t829>"You have nothing to worry about," José Arcadio Buendía told his wife. "This fellow is just a hermaphrodite."</t829><t830>However, she continued to keep watch until her daughters' dance lessons were over and the Italian man had left Macondo.</t830><t831>So she began preparing for the celebration.</t831><t832>Úrsula made a list of the guests to be invited to the party, selecting only the descendants of the founders of Macondo, excluding the family of Pilar Ternera, who by then had two more illegitimate children.</t832><t833>In fact, it was a unique selection determined by friendships, as those chosen were not only close friends of the José Arcadio Buendía family since before the migration that led to the founding of Macondo but also because their descendants had been childhood friends of Aureliano and Arcadio.</t833><t834>Their daughters were the only girls who regularly visited to embroider with Rebeca and Amaranta.</t834><t835>Don Apolinar Moscote, a kind-hearted official whose duties were limited to maintaining two policemen armed only with batons and supporting them within his modest means, was merely an authority figure in name.</t835><t836>To ensure daily expenses, his daughters had to open a small shop where they made felt flowers, prepared guava jelly, and wrote love letters for the young men and women in the village.</t836><t837>Despite their humility and good manners, his daughters—beautiful and the most graceful dancers of the new dances in the village—could not find a way to be invited to the celebration.</t837>
<t838>While Úrsula and the girls opened the box to take out the utensils, the shiny bowls, dishes, cups, and hung on the walls the paintings of noble ladies standing on boats filled with caged flowers, and with these tasks, the mother and her daughters breathed new life into the polished rooms created by the masons, José Arcadio Buendía abandoned his quest to find the image of God, admitting the nonexistence of the deity, and dismantled the automatic piano to understand its mysteries.</t838> <t839>After many days of fumbling with the tangle of wires stretching out at one end only to coil back at the other, and a heap of surplus pegs and levers, José Arcadio Buendía managed to reassemble the automatic piano, but did so very poorly.</t839> <t840>He completed this task two days before the celebration.</t840> <t841>Never before had there been so much anxiety and bustling in this house as in those days.</t841> <t842>Yet the new lamps, freshly lit with tar, still shone brightly at the appointed day and hour.</t842> <t843>The house was wide open, still fragrant with the smell of pine resin and damp lime.</t843> <t844>The descendants of the founders of Macondo familiarized themselves with the hallways adorned with potted ferns and begonias, the serene rooms, the garden fragrant with roses, and then gathered in the living room before the machine, previously unknown, covered with a white cloth.</t844> <t845>Those who were familiar with the commonly used pianos in the villages around the swamp felt a bit uneasy.</t845> <t846>But the most bitter disappointment was Úrsula's when a music roll was placed in the automatic piano for Rebeca and Amaranta to start the dance, but the mechanism did not move at all.</t846>
<t847>Menkyađêt, now almost blind, tried to recall the skills from his vast repository of ancient knowledge to repair the automatic piano.</t847> <t848>Finally, purely by chance, José Arcadio Buendía managed to make a dead machine turn, and thus the music that initially sounded mournful began to flow like a stream of sound composed of incomprehensible notes.</t848> <t849>The piano hammers struck chaotically.</t849> <t850>They kept hitting the strings, which were arranged haphazardly, without any order, causing them to vibrate with a trembling, fearful sound.</t850>
<t851>But the stubborn descendants of the twenty-one brave souls who once traversed the forest heading west to find the sea, managed to overcome the difficult spots caused by changes in the music, and thus the dance lasted until morning.</t851>
<t852>Piêtrô Crêspi returned to repair the automatic piano.</t852>
<t853>Rebecca and Amaranta helped him arrange the order of the strings, and they joined him in laughing at the tricky parts of the waltzes.</t853> <t854>He displayed such a respectable and noble demeanor that Úrsula did not feel the need to supervise her daughters' dance lessons.</t854> <t855>The night before his departure, an impromptu dance with the newly repaired automatic piano was organized to bid him farewell.</t855> <t856>He and Rebecca performed the modern dances exceptionally well.</t856>
<t857>Accadio and Amaranta were no less graceful and lively in their movements.</t857><t858>But the performance had to be stopped because Pila Tecnera, who was outside the door with the curious onlookers, got into a fight with a woman who dared to comment that Accadio had a woman's buttocks.</t858><t859>At midnight, Pietro Crespi bid farewell to the family with an emotional speech, promising to return soon.</t859><t860>Rebecca saw him to the main door, and after closing all the doors and turning off the house lights, she went to her room to cry.</t860><t861>It was a mournful cry that lasted several days, the reason for which no one knew, not even Amaranta.</t861><t862>She was always a mysterious person, and that was not unusual.</t862><t863>Despite her seemingly open and polite exterior, she was actually a lonely person with an inscrutable heart.</t863><t864>She was a splendid adolescent girl, slender and fond of sitting on the wooden rocking chair she had brought to the house, which had been repaired many times and lacked armrests.</t864><t865>No one discovered that at her age she still had the habit of sucking her thumb.</t865><t866>Therefore, she never missed an opportunity to be alone in the bathroom and maintained the habit of sleeping facing the wall.</t866><t867>On rainy afternoons, while sitting and embroidering with a group of girlfriends in the hallway with begonias, she would suddenly lose track of the lively conversation, letting a tear of longing roll down her cheek and salt her tongue as she looked at the wet patches of earth and the small mounds of clay that worms pushed up in the garden.</t867><t868>When she began to cry, those secret pleasures, once defeated by orange juice mixed with rhubarb powder in previous years, resurfaced in an uncontrollable desire.</t868><t869>She ate earth again as she had before.</t869><t870>At first, she ate it almost out of curiosity, believing that the unpleasant taste of the earth would be an effective remedy against her desire.</t870><t871>And indeed, she could not stand the earth in her mouth.</t871><t872>But as her growing craving overcame her, she forced herself to endure it.</t872><t873>It was the old craving, the fondness for eating minerals, the eager joy of consuming primal food.</t873><t874>She stuffed pieces of earth into her pockets and secretly ate them one by one without being seen.</t874><t875>She ate them, feeling both a sense of blissful satisfaction and bitter resentment while teaching her girlfriends the most intricate embroidery stitches and talking about men who were unworthy of the sacrifices she made, such as eating wall lime for them.</t875><t876>These pieces of earth became less ancient and more distinct, representing the only man worthy of such self-destruction, as if the ground he trod with his elegant varnished boots somewhere else in the world transmitted to the girl the weight and warmth of his blood in the taste of minerals, leaving a bitter sensation in her mouth and a lasting sediment of peace in her heart.</t876>
<t877>One afternoon, without any particular reason, Amparo Moscote suddenly asked to visit the house.</t877> <t878>Amaranta and Rebeca, bewildered by the unannounced visit, reluctantly received her.</t878> <t879>They showed her the newly renovated house, let her listen to music from the automatic piano, and offered her oranges with biscuits.</t879> <t880>Amparo presented herself as a cheerful and well-mannered young lady, which moved Úrsula during the moments she sat with them to entertain the guest.</t880> <t881>After two hours, when the conversation had begun to wane, Amparo took advantage of Amaranta's distraction to hand Rebeca a letter.</t881> <t882>The girl only had time to see the line: "To the distinguished Miss Rebeca Buendía," written in neat handwriting, with blue ink and a spacing style that was both airy and pleasing to the eye, similar to the instructions for using the automatic piano. Then she carefully folded and tucked the letter into her bodice with her fingers.</t882> <t883>She looked at Amparo Moscote with a gaze that conveyed immense gratitude and silently vowed to fulfill the wish until her dying day.</t883>
<t884>The sudden friendship between Amparo and Rebeca awakened Aureliano's hopes. The longing for the girl Remedios tormented him incessantly, but he had no opportunity to see her again.</t884> <t885>When he strolled around the village with his old friends like Macrophico Visban and Herinendo Maquet - the sons of the founders with the same names - he eagerly searched for the girl in the tailor's shop with his eyes, but he only saw her sisters.</t885> <t886>Amparo Moscote's presence in his house felt like an omen.</t886> <t887>"She will come with her sister," Aureliano told himself.</t887> <t888>"The little sister will come."</t888> <t889>He repeated it many times with all his faith.</t889> <t890>Thus, one afternoon while making a goldfish in the workshop, he was certain that the girl had responded to the call of his heart.</t890> <t891>Indeed, shortly thereafter, he heard a clear, innocent voice, and when he looked up with a startled heart, he saw the girl in a pink gauze dress, wearing white boots, standing right at the door.</t891>
<t892>- Remedios, don't go in there! - Amparo Moscote called from the hallway.</t892> <t893>- They are working in there!</t893>
<t894>But Aureliano did not let the girl listen to her sister: He handed her the goldfish with a small ring in its mouth and said to her:</t894>
<t895>- Come in! Come in!</t895>
<t896>The little girl walked closer and asked him a few questions that Aureliano couldn't answer, because a sudden asthma attack prevented him.</t896> <t897>He wanted to be with the little girl forever, close to her ivory skin, close to her emerald green eyes, close to her voice that, with each question, called him "sir" with all the respect she still had for her father.</t897> <t898>Melquiades sat in the corner of the room next to the writing desk, jotting down unreadable symbols.</t898> <t899>Aureliano was furious with him.</t899> <t900>He could do nothing except tell Remedios that he would give her a goldfish, and she, horrified by the gift, quickly ran out of the workshop.</t900> <t901>That afternoon, Aureliano lost his composure, the deep calm he usually had while waiting for a chance to see the little girl.</t901> <t902>He neglected his work.</t902> <t903>In desperate attempts to concentrate, he called her name many times, but Remedios did not respond.</t903> <t904>He looked for her at her sisters' dress shop, during visits to her house, in her father's office, but he only saw her in the image steeped in his own terrible loneliness.</t904> <t905>For hours and hours, he sat with Rebeca in the living room, listening to waltzes played by the automatic piano.</t905> <t906>Rebeca listened to the waltzes because Pietro Crespi had taught her to dance to that music.</t906> <t907>And Aureliano listened to the waltzes because, quite simply, that music reminded him of Remedios.</t907>
<t908>The house was filled with love, Aureliano expressed his love in poetry, verses without beginning or end.</t908> <t909>He wrote them on the parchment given by old Melquiades, on the bathroom walls, on the skin of his own arms, and in those verses, he depicted a distorted Remedios: Remedios in the fleeting breeze at two in the afternoon, Remedios in the silent breath of roses, Remedios in the steaming bread fresh from the oven in the morning, Remedios everywhere and Remedios forever and ever.</t909> <t910>Standing by the window embroidering, Rebeca longed for love to arrive at four in the afternoon.</t910> <t911>She knew that the mailman's donkey only came to the village once every fortnight, but she always hoped, telling herself that by mistake it might come any day.</t911> <t912>But the opposite happened: one time the donkey did not come on the scheduled day.</t912> <t913>So the girl went mad with disappointment.</t913> <t914>In the middle of the night, she woke up to eat handfuls of earth from the flower garden.</t914> <t915>In her desperate desire to commit suicide, she cried bitterly, both in sorrow and anger, while chewing on soft worms and crunching the shells of snails.</t915> <t916>She vomited until morning. She collapsed from exhaustion.</t916> <t917>She lost her sanity, and her heart pounded restlessly without shame.</t917> <t918>Ursula, horrified, unlocked the chest and found at the bottom sixteen fragrant letters carefully tied with pink ribbons, along with skeleton leaves and dried flower calyxes hidden in old books, and the dried bodies of butterflies that would turn to dust at the slightest touch.</t918>
<t919>Aureliano was the only one who understood the boundless suffering.</t919>
<t920>That afternoon, while Úrsula was trying to treat Rebeca from her stupor, he, along with Magnífico Visbal and Hernando Márquez, went to Catarino's eatery. The eatery had been expanded with a row of wooden rooms, rooms for the single women who wore makeup.</t920> <t921>A band consisting of drums and accordion played songs by old Francisco - The Man who had disappeared from the village of Macondo years ago.</t921> <t922>The three friends drank guarapo.</t922> <t923>Magnífico and Márquez were contemporaries of Aureliano, but they were more worldly than him in the ways of revelry.</t923> <t924>Both of them drank freely with the girls sitting on their laps.</t924> <t925>One of those girls, the withered one with gold teeth, had actively flirted with Aureliano. But he did not like her.</t925> <t926>He realized that the more he drank, the more he missed Remedios intensely, but the tormenting longing was more bearable.</t926> <t927>He did not know when he started to feel light and buoyant.</t927>
<t928>He saw his friends along with the floating women swimming in the radiant reflected light, speaking words that seemed not to come from their mouths, making mystical movements that seemed disconnected from their gestures.</t928>
<t929>Mr. Catarinô placed his hand on his back and said, "It's almost eleven o'clock."</t929> <t930>Aurêlianô turned his face around and saw a large, distorted face with a felt flower tucked behind the ear, and he immediately lost his memory as he had previously suffered from amnesia. Then he remembered that: on a distant early morning in a completely unfamiliar room to him, where Pila Tecnêra was present, dressed in underwear, barefoot, with disheveled hair, holding an oil lamp illuminating his face, and she was half-believing, half-doubting in astonishment:</t930>
<t931>- Oh my God, is that you, Aureliano</t931><t932>!</t932>
<t933>Aureliano stood firm on his two feet, raising his head.</t933> <t934>He had forgotten how he got there but still clearly knew his purpose, because since childhood he had carried that purpose with him and kept it hidden in the deepest recesses of his heart.</t934>
<t935>- I came to sleep with you!</t935>
<t936>He wore clothes stained with mud and vomited food.</t936><t937>Pila Tecnêra, who was then living alone with her two youngest children, did not ask him a word.</t937><t938>She took him to bed.</t938><t939>With a wet cloth, she wiped his face, undressed him, and then she undressed herself, letting down the mosquito net so the little children wouldn't see if they woke up.</t939><t940>She was tired of waiting for a man to stay, then waiting for the men who had left, then hoping that all were mistaken due to the inaccuracy of the cards.</t940><t941>While waiting, her skin wrinkled, her breasts sagged, and her heart no longer burned with the fervor of old love.</t941><t942>She groped for Aureliano in the dark and kissed his neck with the affectionate tenderness of a mother: "Oh, my poor little boy."</t942><t943>Aureliano shuddered with a languid touch, noiselessly, he left behind the shores of pain and met Remedios, who had turned into a vast lake with no horizon, redolent of young animals and freshly ironed clothes.</t943><t944>When he found himself drifting aimlessly on that lake, he wept.</t944><t945>At first, they were sobs of pent-up, bitter anguish.</t945>
<t946>Then he awkwardly swam in a boundless source of water, feeling something both slightly painful and achingly about to burst inside his stomach.</t946> <t947>By flicking his head with her finger, she waited until his body expelled a grayish substance that left him exhausted.</t947> <t948>At that moment, Pila Tecnera asked him: "Who is that?".</t948>
<t949>Aureliano told her the name of that person.</t949> <t950>She let out a laugh, the kind of laugh that used to startle the pigeons but now did not wake the children.</t950> <t951>"Then you must marry the girl."</t951> <t952>She mocked him.</t952> <t953>But in that mockery, Aureliano found a quiet place of sympathy.</t953> <t954>When he left the room, he had left behind not only the uncertainty about his own strength but also the bitter weight that had been choking his heart for many months.</t954> <t955>Pilar Ternera suddenly promised him:</t955>
<t956>- I promise to go talk to the girl, - she said, - and you will see that bringing her to you is not difficult at all.</t956>
<t957>She fulfilled her promise at an inopportune moment because Buendía's house had lost the tranquility of the earlier days.</t957> <t958>When she discovered Rebeca's passion, which could not be kept secret because the girl kept screaming incessantly, Amaranta also became feverish.</t958> <t959>The girl also felt the painful thorn of lonely love.</t959>
<t960>Locking herself in the bathroom, the girl calmed the storm of a hopeless passion by writing passionate letters that she contentedly hid at the bottom of a chest.</t960> <t961>Úrsula barely had the strength to take care of her two sick daughters.</t961> <t962>During the long and delicate inquiries, she still could not understand what had led Amaranta to such a state of decline.</t962> <t963>Finally, in a moment of sudden insight, she broke the chest's lock and found the letters tied with a pink ribbon, swollen with fresh lilies, still smudged with tears, meant to be sent but never to be sent to Pietro Crespi.</t963> <t964>Weeping with indignation, she cursed the moment she got the idea to buy the automatic piano, banned the embroidery lessons, and declared mourning, a mourning without a dead person, for a long period until her daughters' disillusionment passed.</t964> <t965>José Arcadio Buendía, who had by then corrected his initial impression of Pietro Crespi and admired his skillful use of musical machines, intervened in the matter, but all his efforts were in vain.</t965> <t966>So when Pilar Ternera informed Aureliano that Remedios was ready to get married, he understood that this news would end all the distress for his parents.</t966>
<t967>But that very news put him face to face with the actual situation.</t967>
<t968>Invited to the clinic to attend a regular seminar, José Arcadio Buendía and Úrsula calmly listened to their son's expressions.</t968> <t969>When he learned the name of his son's lover, José Arcadio Buendía's face turned red with shame.</t969> <t970>"Love is a plague," he angrily thundered.</t970> <t971>"There are so many beautiful and respectable girls for you, yet you go and take the daughter of my enemy."</t971> <t972>But Úrsula approved of her son's choice.</t972> <t973>She expressed her affection and admiration for the seven Moscote sisters, all of whom were beautiful, hardworking, well-mannered, and well-educated.</t973> <t974>And she congratulated her son on his wise choice of a lifelong partner.</t974> <t975>Persuaded by his wife's enthusiasm, José Arcadio Buendía set one condition: Rebeca, who was suitable, would marry Pietro Crespi.</t975>
<t976>During a trip when there is time, Úrsula will take Amaranta to the city so that interacting with a different crowd will gradually help her feel better, and she will wake up from her delusion.</t976>
<t977>Rebecca recovered very quickly when she learned of the family's unanimous opinion and immediately wrote a cheerful letter to inform her lover of her parents' official decision, then she put it in the mailbox without needing an intermediary anymore.</t977>
<t978>Amaranta pretended to comply with her parents' decision and gradually recovered from the fever, but she kept telling herself that if Rebeca wanted to marry Pietro Crespi, she would have to step over her dead body.</t978> <t979>A week later, José Arcadio Buendía dressed in a dark wool suit, a collared shirt, and the chamois leather boots he had worn on the night of the new house celebration, went to ask for Remedios Moscote's hand in marriage for his son.</t979> <t980>The magistrate and his wife welcomed him with a mix of joy and worry, because they did not know the purpose of this sudden visit, and then they thought he might have mistaken the name of the chosen daughter.</t980> <t981>To avoid any misunderstanding, the mother woke Remedios and carried her into the living room.</t981> <t982>The little girl was still half-asleep.</t982> <t983>They asked her if she really wanted to get married, and she cried and replied that she just wanted everyone to leave her alone so she could sleep. José Arcadio Buendía, understanding the Moscotes' confusion, went home to explain everything to Aureliano.</t983> <t984>When he returned to the magistrate's house, the Moscotes had dressed according to protocol, rearranged the furniture, and replaced the flowers in the vase.</t984> <t985>Weary from doing something against his will and from the tight collar that was choking him, José Arcadio Buendía confirmed that Remedios was indeed the one Aureliano had chosen to marry.</t985>
<t986>"It's not going well at all," Apolinar Moscote said sadly.</t986> <t987>"We still have six daughters, all of whom are unmarried and of marriageable age, and they would all be delighted to become the proper wives of respectable and hardworking young men like the one in your family, but unfortunately, Aureliano only fancies the little girl who still wets the bed."</t987>
<t988>His wife, a woman who still retained a graceful charm, with slightly melancholic eyes and demeanor, had opposed his foolish words.</t988> <t989>When everyone finished drinking the fruit juice, the Moscotes couple happily accepted Aureliano's proposal. However, Mrs. Moscote requested to speak privately with Mrs. Úrsula. Partly out of curiosity, partly out of self-pity for being troubled by men's issues, but actually very fearful and emotional, Úrsula visited Mrs. Moscote the next day.</t989> <t990>Half an hour later, she returned with the news that Remedios was not yet of age.</t990> <t991>Aureliano did not consider this a major obstacle.</t991> <t992>He had waited long enough that he could wait as long as necessary until the girl reached puberty.</t992>
<t993>The house regained its peaceful and warm atmosphere, and it was only disrupted when Melquiades passed away.</t993> <t994>Although his death was an obvious event, the exact timing of it was unpredictable.</t994>
<t995>After returning for a few months, a rapid and intense aging process occurred in the old man’s body, to the extent that he was immediately regarded as one of those decrepit old men, wandering around like shadows in the room, heavily dragging his feet, mumbling loudly about the glorious memories of his life. In reality, old people were those who were not cared for or remembered by anyone until one day, they were found dead, stiff on their beds in the morning.</t995> <t996>At first, José Arcadio Buendía helped him, fascinated by the novelty of photography and the prophecies of Nostradamus.</t996> <t997>But gradually, he left him alone in his own lonely world, because communication between the two became increasingly difficult.</t997> <t998>He became more and more blind and deaf, as if he mistook the people talking to him for those he knew in the distant past of humanity, and he answered their questions with rambling sentences mixing various languages together.</t998> <t999>As if guided by direct intuition, he groped through the air as he walked.</t999> <t1000>Even though he had to weave between objects, he never knocked them over. One day, he forgot to put in his false teeth, which were still soaking in a cup of water next to his bedside.</t1000> <t1001>and he never used them again.</t1001> <t1002>When Úrsula decided to expand the house, she made him a private room right next to Aureliano’s jewelry workshop.</t1002>
<t1003>This room is far from the noise and kitchen work, with a window letting in abundant light into the room and a bookshelf filled with books almost tattered by dust and gnawed by cockroaches, scraps of paper densely covered with illegible writing, and a water jug containing false teeth that had tiny yellow flowers blooming on water lettuce, all arranged by Úrsula herself.</t1003> <t1004>The new room seemed to please old Melquíades because he was never seen leaving his room, not even during mealtimes when he was absent from the dining room.</t1004> <t1005>He only went to Aureliano's workshop and stayed there for hours and hours to write incomprehensible literature on parchment.</t1005> <t1006>It seemed as though these parchments would crack because they were made from a material as dry as puff pastry.</t1006> <t1007>There, he ate the meals brought by Visitación twice a day, although in his final days he did not like to eat and only consumed vegetables.</t1007>
<t1008>Not long after, he bore the lonely and sorrowful appearance of those who eat vegetarian.</t1008> <t1009>A layer of young moss, identical to the thick moss on his all-season coat that he never took off, had covered his skin, and his breath reeked of the farts of a sleeping animal.</t1009> <t1010>Aureliano also forgot him, as he was engrossed in writing his poems.</t1010> <t1011>But there were times when he thought he understood a few things the old man said during his aimless monologues, and he listened intently.</t1011> <t1012>In truth, the only thing he could distinguish in the old man's incomprehensible words was the endless repetition of the word Equinox and the name Alexander von Humboldt.</t1012> <t1013>Arcadio was closer to him when he helped Aureliano in the goldsmith's workshop.</t1013> <t1014>Melquiades responded to this effort to communicate by occasionally bursting out in long strings of Spanish that had little to do with the reality of life.</t1014> <t1015>However, there was one afternoon when he suddenly became cheerful for a moment.</t1015> <t1016>In later years, standing before the firing squad, Arcadio remembered his horror when he heard Melquiades read a few pages of the manuscript.</t1016> <t1017>Of course, he did not understand their meaning, but when he heard the old man read them aloud, he felt they sounded like the Pope's decrees.</t1017> <t1018>After that, for the first time in many years, he smiled and said in Spanish: "When I die, burn me in a fire of mercury for three days right in this room."</t1018> <t1019>Arcadio recounted this to José Arcadio Buendía, who then tried every way possible to get Melquiades to explain more clearly, but he only received a terse reply: "I have reached the level of immortality."</t1019> <t1020>When Melquiades' breath became foul, Arcadio took him to bathe in the river every Thursday morning.</t1020> <t1021>He seemed to get better.</t1021> <t1022>He took off his clothes and waded into the river to bathe with the children, and his mystical intuition guided him to avoid the dangerous rocky parts of the river.</t1022> <t1023>"We are all born from water," he once said.</t1023> <t1024>He lived like that for quite a long time, although no one saw him in the house except when he made a great effort to repair the automatic piano.</t1024> <t1025>When he went to the river with Arcadio, he carried a water scoop made from a gourd shell and a bar of soap wrapped in a towel tucked under his arm.</t1025> <t1026>One Thursday, before they called him to go to the river, Aureliano heard him say: "I died of malaria on the sand dunes of Singapore."</t1026> <t1027>That day, he waded into the river along a dangerous path, and they did not find him until the next morning when his body washed up on a sunlit islet a few kilometers downstream, with a lone hawk perched on his belly.</t1027> <t1028>Despite Ursula's loud protests, who cried for him more bitterly than for her own father, José Arcadio Buendía resisted the villagers' intention to bury him immediately.</t1028> <t1029>"He is immortal," he said, "and he himself has revealed the method of resurrection."</t1029> <t1030>He revived the forgotten water pipes and boiled a cauldron of mercury beside the corpse, which was increasingly covered in greenish blisters.</t1030> <t1031>Don Apolinar Moscote boldly reminded him that not burying a drowned body immediately would endanger the health of the villagers.</t1031> <t1032>"That's not true, because he is still alive."</t1032> <t1033>That was José Arcadio Buendía's reply, who carried out the full sixty-two hours of burning mercury beside the corpse, and when the greenish blisters on the body began to burst like popcorn with a popping sound, filling the house with an unpleasant smell.</t1033> <t1034>Only then did he allow the burial, but not in any ordinary way, but with the solemn ceremonies befitting the greatest benefactor of Macondo.</t1034> <t1035>It was the first and most moving funeral ever seen in the village, and it was only overshadowed by the funeral of the Great Mother nearly a century later.</t1035> <t1036>He was buried in a raised grave in the center of the plot of land the village had designated as the cemetery, with a tombstone bearing the only thing known about him: MELQUIADES. They held nine nights of mourning for him.</t1036> <t1037>In the crowd gathered outside to drink coffee, chat, and play cards, Amaranta found an opportunity to confess her love to Pietro Crespi, who had officially proposed to Rebeca a few weeks earlier and had set up a music and leather toy shop at the spot where the Arabs used to stay to trade trinkets for long-tailed parrots, and the villagers still called it Turkish Street. The Italian, with his golden curly hair that made women sigh with longing, did not have to think much to treat Amaranta like a mischievous little girl.</t1037>
<t1038>- I also have a younger brother, - he told the girl, - he will come to help me look after the store.</t1038>
<t1039>Amaranta felt hurt, and she furiously told Pietro Crespi that she was determined to stop her sister's wedding, even if they had to drag her dead body out of the house.</t1039>
<t1040>The Italian man was so moved by that tragic threat that he didn't dare to tell Rebecca.</t1040> <t1041>Amaranta's trip, always urged by Ursula, was prepared within a week.</t1041> <t1042>Amaranta did not resist, but when she kissed Rebecca goodbye, she whispered in her sister's ear:</t1042>
<t1043>- Don't celebrate too soon.</t1043> <t1044>Even if they take you to the ends of the earth, I will find a way to stop you from getting married, and if that's the case, I will have to kill you.</t1044>
<t1045>The house seemed to grow larger and emptier without Úrsula at home and with the death of Melquíades, but it seemed as if his shadow still flitted through the rooms.</t1045> <t1046>Rebeca took care of the household chores, while the Indian girl managed the candy shop.</t1046> <t1047>In the early evening, when Pietro Crespi, dressed in clothes scented with lavender, arrived, always bringing a toy as a gift, his beloved would receive him in the parlor with all the doors wide open to avoid any suspicion.</t1047> <t1048>This was an unnecessary precaution because the young Italian had shown himself to be so noble that he did not dare to hold the hand of the girl who would be his wife a year before their wedding.</t1048> <t1049>Those visits gradually filled the house with toys.</t1049> <t1050>Dancing dolls that moved with a wind-up key, music boxes, monkeys performing tricks on a wire, galloping horses, drumming clowns—this was a rich and marvelous collection of semi-mechanical toys that consoled José Arcadio Buendía in his sorrow over Melquíades' death and brought him back to the time when he was eager about alchemy.</t1050> <t1051>Thus, he lived in a world of dissected animals and machines taken apart to study and perfect a system of continuous movement based on the principles of the pendulum clock.</t1051>
<t1052>As for himself, Aureliano abandoned his work in the goldsmith's shop to teach little Remedios how to read and write.</t1052> <t1053>At first, the little girl demanded that the guest who often visited in the afternoons bring her doll parts, and she would be a reprehensible child if people made her sit in the room and entertain guests.</t1053> <t1054>But with perseverance and dedication, Aureliano managed to entice the little girl to the point where she would sit with him for hours, absorbing the lessons and using colored pencils to draw on a small board pictures of little houses with cows grazing in the yard and a round sun perched atop the mountain, radiating golden rays.</t1054>
<t1055>Only Rebecca herself suffered from Amaranta's threat.</t1055> <t1056>She understood very well the character, stubbornness, and deep hatred of her younger sister.</t1056> <t1057>Those things were making her afraid.</t1057>
<t1058>Hours spent sitting in the bathroom, she sucked her finger to curb the craving to eat dirt.</t1058> <t1059>She called Pila Tecnêra to her house for a fortune-telling session to ease her worries.</t1059> <t1060>After enthusiastically shuffling and arranging the cards, Pila Tecnêra entered a trance and read the fortune:</t1060>
<t1061>- I won't be happy until my parents are properly buried!</t1061>
<t1062>Rebecca shuddered.</t1062> <t1063>Like a dream, she remembered herself being very small, entering the house carrying a small trunk, a wooden rocking chair, and a sack whose contents she never knew.</t1063> <t1064>She remembered a bald gentleman, dressed in linen with a gold button on his shirt collar, who had nothing to do with the man in the card.</t1064> <t1065>She remembered a very young, glamorous lady with soft hands that smelled of perfume, unlike the rheumatic hands of the woman in the card; that lady had adorned her hair with flowers and taken her for a walk around the village with its green paths in the golden afternoon.</t1065>
<t1066>- I don't understand, - she said.</t1066>
<t1067>Pila Tecnêra was confused:</t1067>
<t1068>- You too, but the cards have spoken.</t1068>
<t1069>Rebecca was terrified, restless day and night when she thought about that prediction, and had to tell José Arcadio Buendía, who immediately scolded her, refusing to validate the card's prediction.</t1069> <t1070>But in reality, he silently searched the house for the sack of human bones: rummaging through trunks and chests, moving furniture, and turning over beds, but still couldn't find it.</t1070> <t1071>He remembered that he hadn't seen it since they rebuilt the house.</t1071> <t1072>He secretly called the masons to the house, and one of them confirmed that he had placed the sack of human bones into a wall cavity and plastered it over because it kept bothering him, distracting him from his work, but now he couldn't remember which room the wall belonged to.</t1072> <t1073>After a few days of searching, with their ears pressed against the walls, they found a faint clattering sound, clatter, clatter, clatter, whispering from within the wall.</t1073> <t1074>They broke through the wall and found the sack of human bones still intact.</t1074> <t1075>That very day, the two sets of human bones were buried in an unmarked grave right next to Melquíades' grave.</t1075> <t1076>José Arcadio Buendía returned home with a sense of relief, as if he had just shed a burden similar to the memory of Prudencio Aguilar that had once weighed heavily on his conscience.</t1076> <t1077>As he passed through the kitchen, he kissed Rebecca on the forehead and said:</t1077>
<t1078>- Shake off those pitiful thoughts, my child! - He said - From now on, you will be happy.</t1078>
<t1079>Rebecca's friendship opened the door for Pilar Ternera to come to the house.</t1079> <t1080>She had been banned by Úrsula since the day Arcadio was born.</t1080> <t1081>Like the noisy running of a herd of female goats, she came to the house at any time and eagerly did all the heavy work.</t1081> <t1082>Sometimes she was present in the jewelry workshop and with lively gestures helped Arcadio smooth out photo paper with affectionate feelings.</t1082> <t1083>Eventually, she made him feel awkward.</t1083> <t1084>That woman confused him.</t1084> <t1085>Her tanned skin, burnt smell, and giggles in the dark room made him breathe rapidly and hastily, constantly making him awkward, bumping into objects around him.</t1085>
<t1086>There were also times when Aureliano was present in the room, engrossed in his work, and Pilar Ternera leaned against the table, admiring his diligent and meticulous work.</t1086> <t1087>Suddenly, she went into a trance.</t1087> <t1088>Aureliano clearly realized that Arcadio was in the room.</t1088> <t1089>Before looking up and catching Pilar Ternera's eyes, revealing thoughts as clear as if they were laid bare under the midday sun, he asked:</t1089>
<t1090>- Alright! Tell me, what is it?</t1090>
<t1091>Pila Tecnêra licked her lips and then gave a sad smile:</t1091>
<t1092>- You are well-suited for war, - she said, - wherever you set your eyes, the bullet you shoot will reach there.</t1092>
<t1093>Aureliano raised his hand in agreement with that prediction.</t1093> <t1094>He refocused his thoughts on his work as if nothing had happened and spoke in a calm yet firm voice:</t1094>
<t1095>- I know, - he said, - that war will bear my name.</t1095>
<t1096>Finally, José Arcadio Buendía accomplished what he wanted to do.</t1096> <t1097>He connected the dancing doll to the clockwork mechanism, and it danced to the music for three consecutive days.</t1097> <t1098>This achievement made him happier than any of his previous exhausting endeavors.</t1098> <t1099>He did not eat.</t1099> <t1100>He did not sleep.</t1100> <t1101>Without Úrsula by his side to care for and look after him, he let himself drift into an imaginary world, which led him to a state of constant excitement.</t1101> <t1102>He spent long sleepless nights pacing back and forth in the room, muttering calculations, trying to apply the principles of the clock pendulum to ox carts, to plows, in short, to anything that could be set in motion.</t1102> <t1103>The fever from insomnia exhausted him so much that one early morning he could not recognize an old man with white hair who suddenly entered the bedroom with a bewildered gesture.</t1103> <t1104>It was Prudencio Aguilar. When he recognized Prudencio Aguilar, he was surprised to see that the dead also aged over the years.</t1104> <t1105>José Arcadio Buendía shivered with nostalgia. "Ah, Prudencio," he exclaimed, "how did you manage to come here from so far away?"</t1105> <t1106>After so many years in the realm of the dead, how intense was the longing for the living, how pressing was the need for companionship, how terrifying was the proximity of another death that already existed within the realm of the dead, which Prudencio Aguilar had just wished upon his worst enemy.</t1106> <t1107>Prudencio Aguilar had spent a long time searching for him.</t1107> <t1108>Prudencio Aguilar inquired about him through the dead souls in Riohacha, through the dead souls in the Uga valley, through the dead souls from the marshlands, but no dead soul gave him the correct answer, because Macondo at that time was still a village unknown to the dead souls.</t1108> <t1109>It was not until Melquíades arrived and pointed out a black dot on the multicolored maps of death.</t1109> <t1110>José Arcadio Buendía talked with Prudencio until dawn.</t1110> <t1111>A few hours later, exhausted from lack of sleep, José Arcadio Buendía entered Aureliano's workshop and asked him, "What day is it today?"</t1111> <t1112>Aureliano replied to his father that it was Tuesday. "I thought so too," José Arcadio Buendía said.</t1112>
<t1113>"But immediately I understood that today was still Monday, just like yesterday."</t1113> <t1114>"Look at the sky, look at the statues, look at the begonias."</t1114> <t1115>"Today is still Monday."</t1115> <t1116>Accustomed to such nonsensical words, Aureliano did not listen to him.</t1116> <t1117>The next day, on Wednesday morning, José Arcadio Buendía entered the workshop again.</t1117> <t1118>"This is a disaster," he said, "Look at the wind, listen to the buzzing of the sun, just like yesterday, and the day before."</t1118> <t1119>That night, Pietro Crespi found him in the hallway, crying with the dry sobs of an old man, crying for Prudencio Aguilar, crying for Melquíades, crying for Rebeca's parents, crying for his own parents, crying for everyone he could remember who was now lonely in death.</t1119> <t1120>Pietro Crespi gave him a wind-up bear that walked on two legs on a wire, but even this gift did not cheer him up.</t1120> <t1121>He asked Pietro about the plan he had given him days before, which was about the possibility of building a machine based on the principle of a clock pendulum that could lift any object into the air, allowing humans to fly.</t1121> <t1122>And Pietro replied that it was impossible because a clock pendulum could lift any object into the air but could not lift itself.</t1122> <t1123>On the hundredth day, he was back in the jewelry workshop with the miserable look of the earth being scraped.</t1123> <t1124>"The time machine is broken," he sobbed, "and Úrsula and Amaranta are very far away."</t1124> <t1125>Aureliano scolded his father like a child, and he obediently listened.</t1125> <t1126>For six continuous hours, he inspected objects, trying to find some difference from the previous day to prove that time was still flowing sequentially.</t1126> <t1127>All night, he lay in bed with his eyes wide open, calling out to Prudencio Aguilar, calling out to Melquíades, calling out to all the dead to come and share his desolation.</t1127> <t1128>But no one came.</t1128> <t1129>On the sixth day, just before everyone woke up, he observed all the external signs of nature, watching until he was sure that it was still Monday.</t1129>
<t1130>So he grabbed the wooden bar used to block the door and with his inherent brutal strength, he smashed to pieces the alchemical laboratory equipment, the goldsmith's workshop, and the camera.</t1130> <t1131>Then, like a demon, he screamed in a language that was both resonant and incessant, yet utterly incomprehensible.</t1131> <t1132>He was ready to destroy the entire house when fortunately, Aureliano had called the neighbors for help.</t1132> <t1133>It took ten strong men to bring him down, fourteen to tie him up, and twenty to drag him to the chestnut tree in the middle of the yard, where they left him tied up, free to bark out strange words and spit out green phlegm. When Ursula and Amaranta returned, he was still tightly bound to the tree, soaked and completely deranged.</t1133> <t1134>The mother and daughter spoke to him, but he did not recognize his own kin.</t1134> <t1135>He spoke to them about something incomprehensible.</t1135> <t1136>Ursula untied the ropes around his wrists and ankles, where the flesh had become calloused from the tight bindings, leaving him only tied at the waist.</t1136> <t1137>After that, they set up a makeshift palm leaf hut to shield him from the rain and sun.</t1137>
<t1138>Chapter 5</t1138>
<t1139>One Sunday in March, Aureliano Buendía and Remedios Moscote were married before the altar of God, which Father Nicanor Reyna had set up right in the Buendía family's living room.</t1139> <t1140>It was a period of intense activity lasting four consecutive weeks in the Moscote household, because little Remedios reached puberty before she had abandoned her childhood habits.</t1140> <t1141>Although her mother had explained the sudden changes of puberty to her, one February afternoon she suddenly panicked and cried out, showing her sisters, who were sitting and embroidering, a slip stained with a slimy chocolate-colored substance.</t1141> <t1142>The wedding date was set for a month later.</t1142> <t1143>There was hardly enough time to teach the girl how to wash herself, dress herself, and understand the essential tasks of family life.</t1143> <t1144>They made her urinate on heated bricks to cure her bedwetting.</t1144> <t1145>It was very difficult to convince her of the inviolability of the bridal chamber, because Remedios was both very frightened and very excited by the instructions to the point that she wanted everyone to talk about the wedding night in all its details.</t1145> <t1146>It was a tremendous effort, but on the day chosen for the wedding, the girl appeared as worldly-wise as any of her older sisters.</t1146>
<t1147>Mr. Apolina Moscote took his daughter by the arm and led her through the village streets adorned with flowers, resonating with the sound of firecrackers and joyful cranes.</t1147> <t1148>The little girl waved and smiled in thanks to those who wished her luck and happiness from their windows.</t1148>
<t1149>Aureliano, dressed in a black wool suit, wearing dark brown boots with spurs, the same boots he would wear years later when facing the firing squad, with a pale, ashen face and a throat tight with emotion, greeted his bride at the door and led her to the altar. The young girl behaved so naturally and appropriately that she maintained her composure even when Aureliano, while placing the ring on her finger, dropped it.</t1149><t1150>In the noisy atmosphere filled with whispers and in the initial moments of confusion among the guests, the bride held up her hand, wearing a stocking that left her toes exposed, and kept her ring finger extended, waiting until the groom, with his booted foot, stopped the ring from rolling out the door and picked it up, his face flushed as he returned to the altar.</t1150><t1151>Her mother and sisters were anxiously worried that the girl might make a mistake, even a small gesture, during the ceremony, and when the ceremony concluded, they were the ones who rushed over, despite the presence of all the guests, to lift her up and shower her with passionate kisses.</t1151><t1152>From that day on, she demonstrated that she was a person of submissive, tactful, and calm nature in the face of family conflicts.</t1152><t1153>She was the one who initiated the wedding feast and took the best piece of the wedding cake, placed it on a plate with a fork, and brought it to José Arcadio Buendía.</t1153><t1154>Tied to the chestnut tree, hunched over on a wooden chair in the palm-thatched hut, the old, fat man with skin bleached by the sun and rain gave a distracted, grateful smile, took the piece of cake, and began to hum an incomprehensible hymn.</t1154><t1155>The only person not happy at the grand wedding that lasted until the early hours of the second day was Rebeca Buendía.</t1155><t1156>Her joyous day did not come to pass.</t1156><t1157>According to an agreement with Úrsula, her wedding was also to be held on the same day as Aureliano's, but on Friday, Pietro Crespi received a letter informing him that his mother was dying.</t1157><t1158>Their wedding was postponed.</t1158><t1159>An hour after receiving the letter, Pietro Crespi left for the city immediately, and on his way, he did not meet his mother, who was also on her way to the village of Macondo to arrive in time for Saturday night. At Aureliano's wedding, she sang a sad song she had composed specifically for her son's wedding.</t1159>
<t1160>Piêtrô Crêspi returned at midnight on Sunday to clean up the cigarette butts from the party after he had raced like the wind, causing five horses to collapse along the way, trying to make it back in time for his own wedding.</t1160> <t1161>The letter writer would never be discovered.</t1161> <t1162>Scolded by Úrsula, Amaranta wept bitterly, swearing on her life and before the altar of God, which the carpenters had not yet removed.</t1162>
<t1163>Father Nicanor Reyna - the person brought here by Apolinar Moscote to perform the wedding ceremony - was a patient man in his exceedingly dull and monotonous work.</t1163> <t1164>He had a sorrowful complexion that clung to his bones, a round, protruding belly, and the overly gentle, almost foolish demeanor of an old deity.</t1164> <t1165>He intended to return to his parish immediately after the wedding, but he was astonished by the excessively rustic and uncouth nature of the people of Macondo, who had proliferated abundantly, living blindly according to natural laws, refusing to baptize their children or give them saint names for the holidays.</t1165>
<t1166>Believing that this land needed God's seeds more than anywhere else, the priest decided to stay another week to convert this village into a village of the Lord, to conduct weddings for couples living together as they pleased, and to baptize those who were gravely ill.</t1166><t1167>But no one listened to the priest.</t1167><t1168>They told the priest that for many years they had lived without the guidance of a pastor, that they resolved their spiritual issues directly with God, and that they had completely abandoned their sinful habits.</t1168><t1169>Weary of preaching in the wilderness, Father Nicanô decided to build the largest church in the world, with life-sized statues and walls inlaid with colorful glass. Such a grand church would attract believers from as far as Rome, bringing glory to God right in the heart of this godless land.</t1169><t1170>The priest went around the village with a brass plate in hand to collect donations.</t1170><t1171>The villagers gave a lot, but the priest wanted more, because the church needed a bell whose sound could make the bodies of drowned people rise to the surface.</t1171><t1172>The priest pleaded so much that he became hoarse.</t1172><t1173>His bones ached as if ants were crawling inside them.</t1173><t1174>One Saturday, unable to get anything, not even fruits or food left at the door, the priest became fearful out of despair.</t1174><t1175>He hastily set up an altar in the middle of the square, and on Sunday, ringing a bell as if during a time of rampant insomnia, he went around the village urging everyone to attend the rustic mass.</t1175><t1176>Many people came out of curiosity.</t1176><t1177>Others came out of longing.</t1177><t1178>Some attended the mass to avoid having God see their neutral stance as personal opposition.</t1178><t1179>So at eight in the morning, half the village had gathered in the square to watch Father Nicanô, hoarse from pleading, reciting the Gospel.</t1179><t1180>At the end of the mass, as the attendees began to disperse, the priest raised his hands high to signal everyone to listen:</t1180>
<t1181>- Wait? Wait? - father said.</t1181> <t1182>- Now we will see an indisputable proof of the infinite power of God.</t1182>
<t1183>The little boy who earlier helped the priest conduct the mass now brought him a cup of thick, steaming hot chocolate, which the priest drank in one continuous gulp.</t1183> <t1184>After that, the priest took the handkerchief tucked in his wide sleeve to wipe his mouth, spread his arms wide, and closed his eyes tightly.</t1184> <t1185>Thus, Father Nicanô lifted himself twelve centimeters off the ground.</t1185> <t1186>It was an easily acceptable trick.</t1186>
<t1187>In a few days, the priest went to every house to remind people of the experiment of lifting oneself off the ground through the neural stimulation power of chocolate.</t1187> <t1188>Meanwhile, the altar boy had collected so much money in the sack that in less than a month, the construction of the church had begun.</t1188> <t1189>No one doubted the divine origin of that demonstration, except for José Arcadio Buendía, who, without moving, observed the chaotic crowd surrounding the chestnut tree one morning to once again see the priest lift himself off the ground.</t1189> <t1190>He almost just slightly stretched his legs on the chair and shrugged when Father Nicanor began to lift himself off the ground along with the chair he was sitting on.</t1190>
<t1191>- This is the simplest - said José Arcadio Buendía - this man has discovered the fourth state of matter</t1191>
<t1192>Father Nicanor raised his hand and immediately the four legs of the chair lowered to stand on the ground.</t1192>
<t1193>- I deny it - he said. - In fact, this proves the existence of God without a doubt.</t1193>
<t1194>Thus it was known that the incomprehensible demonic language of José Arcadio Buendía was Latin.</t1194> <t1195>Father Nicanor took advantage of the opportunity, being the only one who could communicate with José Arcadio Buendía, to instill Christian faith into his deranged mind.</t1195> <t1196>Every afternoon, the priest would sit by the chestnut tree and preach in Latin, but José Arcadio Buendía, delighted, would not acknowledge the old worn paths nor the changing color of chocolate and demanded to see a picture of God, considering it as the ultimate proof.</t1196> <t1197>So Father Nicanor brought him badges and pictures and even a reproduction of a cloth embroidered with the image of Saint Veronica, but José Arcadio dismissed them as handicrafts without scientific basis.</t1197> <t1198>He was so stubborn that Father Nicanor had to abandon his intention of converting him to Christianity. However, in terms of personal affection, the priest still visited him regularly.</t1198> <t1199>But at that time, José Arcadio Buendía took the initiative to attack and intended to break the priest's faith with rational arguments.</t1199> <t1200>There were times when Father Nicanor brought a chessboard with all the pieces to the chestnut tree to invite him to play checkers.</t1200>
<t1201>José Arcadio Buendía did not play, as he could never understand the meaning of a contest in which the two opponents had agreed on the principles.</t1201> <t1202>Father Nicanor, who had never seen anyone play chess in such a manner, also did not return to play checkers.</t1202> <t1203>Day by day, Father Nicanor admired José Arcadio Buendía's intelligence more and more.</t1203> <t1204>He asked him how he could be tied to the tree like that.</t1204>
<t1205>- This is very simple, - he replied - because I am mad.</t1205>
<t1206>From that point on, taking care of his faith, the pastor no longer visited him, resolutely starting the construction of the church immediately.</t1206> <t1207>Rebecca felt her hope rekindling.</t1207> <t1208>Her future depended on the completion of this work.</t1208> <t1209>She thought so because since that Sunday when Pastor Nicano had lunch at their house and the whole family gathered around the dining table to talk about the solemn and grand ceremonies in religious activities once the church was completed.</t1209> <t1210>"The luckiest person here is Rebecca," Amaranta said.</t1210> <t1211>And seeing that Rebecca did not understand what she meant, she explained with an innocent smile:</t1211>
<t1212>- Oh, it's because your wedding will coincide with the inauguration of the church.</t1212>
<t1213>Rebecca hurriedly blocked any comments about this matter.</t1213> <t1214>According to the construction progress, the church cannot be completed before ten years.</t1214> <t1215>Father Nicanor disagreed because he believed that with the newfound generosity of the faithful, he could make the optimists even more hopeful.</t1215> <t1216>In response to Rebecca's silent sulking, who had to leave her meal unfinished, Ursula agreed with Amaranta's idea and contributed a significant portion of her wealth to accelerate the construction progress.</t1216> <t1217>Father Nicanor believed that with another contribution like this, the house would be completed in less than three years.</t1217>
<t1218>From that moment on, Rebeca refused to speak to Amaranta, telling herself that Amaranta's provocative attitude was not as innocent as she had thought.</t1218> <t1219>"That is the least serious thing that could happen," Amaranta retorted to Rebeca in the fierce argument that took place that night.</t1219> <t1220>"So, for the next three years, I won't need to kill you."</t1220> <t1221>Rebeca accepted that challenge.</t1221>
<t1222>When Pietro Crespi learned that his wedding was postponed again, he fell into a state of despair.</t1222> <t1223>In contrast, Rebeca demonstrated her loyalty.</t1223> <t1224>"We will elope whenever you decide," she said.</t1224> <t1225>However, Pietro Crespi was not one to take risks.</t1225> <t1226>He lacked the passionate nature of a lover and was overly scrupulous, treating promises as treasures that could not be squandered.</t1226> <t1227>So Rebeca resorted to bolder tactics.</t1227> <t1228>A strange wind blew out the lamp in the living room, and Úrsula caught the two of them kissing in the dark.</t1228> <t1229>Pietro Crespi clumsily explained to her about the poor quality of modern candles that burned with tar and helped her set up a more reliable lighting system in the living room.</t1229> <t1230>But another time, the lamp was either filled with the wrong oil or the wick slipped.</t1230> <t1231>Úrsula caught Rebeca sitting on her lover's lap again.</t1231> <t1232>So she refused to listen to any more excuses.</t1232> <t1233>She assigned the Indian girl to watch over the candy store and sat in the rocking chair herself to supervise the lovers' conversations, determined not to be outdone by the old tricks she was familiar with from her own youth.</t1233>
<t1234>"Poor mother!", Rebecca said with all the resentment mixed with a bit of humor as she watched Ursula yawning in the tense atmosphere of the visit.</t1234> <t1235>"When I die, I might just go on this rocking chair."</t1235> <t1236>After three months of living in a love that was closely monitored, disheartened by the delays in the construction work that he visited every day, Pietro Crespi agreed to contribute the money Father Nicanor needed to complete the church building. Amaranta did not lose heart. While sitting and chatting with the sisters who often came to the house in the afternoons to embroider or knit on the porch, she tried to come up with new schemes.</t1236> <t1237>A mistake ruined the scheme she thought was the most effective.</t1237> <t1238>It was the plan to steal the mothballs that Rebecca had placed in her bridal gown before storing it in the chest in the bedroom.</t1238> <t1239>Amaranta would do it when there were less than two months left until the church construction was completed.</t1239> <t1240>But Rebecca was so eager for her wedding day to come that she wanted to prepare her bridal gown earlier than Amaranta had planned.</t1240> <t1241>When she opened the chest, then the wrapping paper, and finally the silk covering, she found the satin wedding dress, a veil, and an orange blossom crown, all eaten to dust by moths.</t1241> <t1242>Although she was sure she had placed two packets of mothballs wrapped in handkerchiefs in the dress, the misfortune seemed entirely accidental, so she did not dare blame Amaranta.</t1242> <t1243>With less than a month until the wedding, it was no problem because she had Amparo Moscote who could sew the bridal gown in just a week.</t1243> <t1244>One rainy afternoon, Amparo, wearing a raincoat, entered the house to give the final fitting of the bridal gown for Rebecca, and Amaranta felt so furious she wanted to die.</t1244> <t1245>Her voice faltered, and a cold sweat ran down her spine.</t1245> <t1246>For many months she had lived in anxious anticipation of that moment.</t1246> <t1247>Because if she did not successfully create a decisive obstacle to prevent Rebecca's wedding, she was certain that, in the final moment when all other schemes had failed, she would have the courage to poison Rebecca.</t1247> <t1248>That afternoon, while Rebecca was suffocating from the heat in the satin dress being fitted by Amparo, who was calmly pinning it to fit her body, Amaranta had pricked her fingers several times with the crochet hook.</t1248> <t1249>But with terrifying coldness, she decided that the day to poison Rebecca would be the Friday closest to the wedding day, and the method would be a drop of opium dissolved in coffee.</t1249>
<t1250>A major obstacle, very brutal and also very unexpected, came crashing down, forcing the wedding to be postponed once again, with no idea of when it would finally take place.</t1250><t1251>Just one week before the wedding, suddenly at midnight, Remedios woke up vomiting and having diarrhea, her body drenched in the hot, foul-smelling contents from her stomach, and after three days, she died from poisoning by her own blood, carrying a twin fetus in her womb.</t1251><t1252>Amaranta tormented herself with guilt.</t1252><t1253>She had fervently prayed to God for something terrible to happen so that she wouldn't have to poison Rebeca, and thus she felt guilty for Remedios's death.</t1253><t1254>This was not the obstacle she had prayed for.</t1254><t1255>Remedios had brought a new, joyful breeze into the house.</t1255><t1256>She and her husband moved into the room next to the jewelry workshop, and she decorated their living space with all her childhood dolls and toys. Her youthful vitality spread beyond the four walls, like a refreshing breeze blowing through the corridors adorned with pots of begonias.</t1256><t1257>From the moment she woke up, she would sing.</t1257><t1258>She was the only one in the house who dared to intervene in the arguments between Rebeca and Amaranta.</t1258><t1259>She took on the responsibility of caring for José Arcadio Buendía.</t1259><t1260>She brought food to her father-in-law, diligently attended to him during his bathroom needs, bathed him with soap and scrubbing pads, kept his beard and hair free from lice, and maintained and repaired his palm-leaf hut during stormy seasons.</t1260><t1261>In the final months of her life, she communicated with him using simple Latin phrases.</t1261><t1262>When Aureliano's son with Pilar Ternera was born, brought home, and named Aureliano José, Remedios decided to acknowledge the boy as her own firstborn.</t1262><t1263>Her maternal affection greatly surprised Úrsula.</t1263><t1264>For his part, Aureliano found in her the essential justification for his life.</t1264><t1265>He worked all day in the workshop, and Remedios would bring him a cup of unsweetened coffee in the middle of the morning.</t1265><t1266>Every night, they would visit the Moscotes.</t1266><t1267>Aureliano would engross himself in playing dominoes with his father-in-law while Remedios chatted cheerfully with her sisters-in-law and discussed adult matters with her mother.</t1267><t1268>The close relationship with the Buendía family strengthened Don Apolinar Moscote's authority in the village.</t1268><t1269>During his frequent trips to the provincial capital, he had secured government approval to open a school, which was managed by Arcadio, who had inherited his grandfather's passion for teaching.</t1269><t1270>Through persuasive measures, he managed to get most of the houses in the village painted blue to celebrate Independence Day.</t1270><t1271>In response to Father Nicanor's suggestions, he decided to relocate Catarino's eatery to a secluded street and shut down several noisy establishments that had sprung up in the village center.</t1271><t1272>On one of his trips back from the provincial capital, he brought along six armed policemen.</t1272><t1273>These were the men he entrusted with maintaining order.</t1273><t1274>However, no one reminded him of his promise to José Arcadio Buendía that he would not use armed police in the village.</t1274>
<t1275>Aureliano was very fond of his resourceful father-in-law.</t1275> <t1276>"You'll end up as plump as he is," his friends told him. But the leisure that had once puffed up his cheeks and concentrated the light in his eyes did not increase his body weight nor did it disrupt his pride; on the contrary, it only accentuated the lines on his lips, a sign of deep thought and unshakable determination.</t1276> <t1277>The deep affection between him and his wife awakened the feelings of both families to such an extent that when Remedios announced she was pregnant, even Rebeca and Amaranta reconciled to weave a blue linen if it was a boy and a pink linen if it was a girl.</t1277> <t1278>She was the last person Arcadio thought of a few years later when he stood before the firing squad.</t1278>
<t1279>Ursula decided to mourn her for a year.</t1279> <t1280>She ordered all the doors to be closed, no one to enter or leave except in unavoidable circumstances, forbade loud talking, and personally hung Remedios' picture at the place where her body was laid out, placing an oil lamp that would burn continuously in front of the picture.</t1280> <t1281>Future generations, who never let the oil lamp go out, were puzzled by the picture of the girl in a puffed dress, white boots, and a bow in her hair, unable to reconcile that image with their own imagination of an aunt.</t1281> <t1282>Amaranta took in Aureliano José and raised him as her own son.</t1282> <t1283>He would be the one to share her loneliness and console her from the torment of her fervent prayers that had inadvertently caused the opium to fall into Remedios' coffee.</t1283> <t1284>In the evenings, Pietro Crespi, wearing a mourning band on his hat, would tiptoe into the house to quietly visit Rebeca, a Rebeca who seemed to be bleeding out in her black dress with sleeves that covered the backs of her hands.</t1284> <t1285>The mere thought of rescheduling the wedding was already considered highly improper, thus their romantic relationship became an eternal one, a weary love that no one wanted to tend to, as if the lovers who had turned off the lights to kiss in the dark had drifted apart by the will of death.</t1285> <t1286>Completely disoriented and having lost her sanity, Rebeca began eating earth again.</t1286>
<t1287>The mourning had been going on for quite some time, to the point where the family had to reorganize the prayer sessions at home.</t1287><t1288>At two in the afternoon on a quiet, unbearably hot day, someone suddenly pushed open the door leading to the main road, causing the doors to creak with such force that it shook the entire house where Amaranta and her friends were sitting and embroidering in the hallway, Rebeca was sucking her thumb in the bedroom, Úrsula was busy in the kitchen, Aureliano was diligently working in the goldsmith's workshop, and José Arcadio Buendía was sitting alone under the chestnut tree; everyone felt a shiver as if there was an earthquake.</t1288><t1289>A burly man came to the house.</t1289><t1290>His broad back seemed too large to fit through the door.</t1290><t1291>Around his neck, he wore a chain with a medallion of Saint Remedios the Virgin.</t1291><t1292>His chest and arms were covered in tattoos of cemetery images.</t1292><t1293>On his wrist, he wore a bronze statue of the crucified Jesus.</t1293><t1294>He had weather-beaten dark skin, short and shaggy hair like a mule's mane, a strong, protruding jaw, and sad eyes.</t1294><t1295>His belt was twice as thick as a horse's rein.</t1295><t1296>His short boots had spurs and were reinforced with iron.</t1296><t1297>And his presence gave everyone the shiver of an impending earthquake.</t1297><t1298>He walked through the living room, then the waiting room, carrying old bags in his hands.</t1298><t1299>Then, like a thunderclap, he appeared in the hallway where the begonias were placed, where Amaranta and her friends, who were sewing, were so startled that they raised their hands holding the needles.</t1299>
<t1300>"Hello," he said to the girls in a tired voice, then threw the bags onto the desk.</t1300> <t1301>After that, he hurriedly walked into the inner house. "Hello," he said to Rebeca, who was looking at him in panic as he passed by the bedroom window. "Hello," he said to Aureliano in the jewelry workshop, who was straining all five senses to listen.</t1301> <t1302>He went straight into the kitchen, and here for the first time, he paused at the end of a journey around the world. "Hello," he said.</t1302>
<t1303>Ursula stood still for a second, her mouth agape, staring straight into his eyes.</t1303> <t1304>She let out a cry and then jumped up to hug his neck, crying and shouting with joy.</t1304> <t1305>It was José Arcadio.</t1305>
<t1306>He returned as poor as when he left, to the point that Ursula had to give him two pesos to pay for the horse rental.</t1306> <t1307>He spoke Spanish mixed with sailor slang.</t1307> <t1308>When people asked him where he had been, he answered, "Over there."</t1308> <t1309>He hung a hammock in the room reserved for him and slept for three days straight.</t1309> <t1310>When he woke up, after eating sixteen boiled eggs, he went straight to Catarino's eatery. There, his massive body sparked lively and curious discussions among the women.</t1310> <t1311>He organized a party with music and strong liquor for everyone.</t1311> <t1312>He challenged five men to arm wrestle him simultaneously.</t1312> <t1313>"No way," they said when they realized they couldn't budge his arm, "because you have the crucified Jesus helping you"... Catarino, who still didn't believe in his strength, bet him twelve pesos if he could lift his counter.</t1313> <t1314>José Arcadio lifted the counter, balanced it on his head, and carried it out to the middle of the street.</t1314> <t1315>It took eleven strong men to carry it back to its original place.</t1315> <t1316>In the lively, festive atmosphere, José Arcadio stood on the counter, showing off his muscular body covered in tattoos with blue and red writing in various languages.</t1316> <t1317>Turning to the women surrounding him, with insatiable greed, he asked who would pay more.</t1317> <t1318>The wealthiest woman gave him several dozen pesos.</t1318> <t1319>So he organized a raffle with tickets costing ten pesos each.</t1319> <t1320>It was an exorbitant price because the most popular woman could only earn eight pesos a night.</t1320> <t1321>But all the women accepted the price.</t1321> <t1322>They wrote their names on fourteen tickets, mixed them up, put them all in a hat, and then each woman drew a ticket.</t1322> <t1323>When only two tickets were left, he approached the women who were about to draw.</t1323>
<t1324>- Pay an extra five dollars per ticket, - José Arcadio urged, - and then I'll split it between the two of you.</t1324>
<t1325>He lived that way.</t1325> <t1326>He had circled the earth sixty-five times, living with exiled sailors.</t1326> <t1327>The women who slept with him that night in Catarino's shop had taken him stark naked to the dance hall so everyone could see his body, not a single millimeter without a tattoo: tattoos in the front, tattoos in the back, tattoos from his neck down to his toes.</t1327> <t1328>He could not integrate into family life.</t1328>
<t1329>He slept all day, and at night he stayed up gambling and testing his strength in the poor worker's neighborhood. On rare occasions, Úrsula managed to get him to sit at the dinner table.</t1329> <t1330>He came across as a likable person, especially when recounting his adventurous tales in distant lands.</t1330> <t1331>He had been shipwrecked and drifted for several weeks on the Japanese sea, surviving by eating the salted and sun-cooked flesh of a friend who had died of sunstroke, which had turned into a sweet-tasting jerky.</t1331> <t1332>One scorching afternoon in the Bay of Bengal, his ship defeated a sea dragon, inside which they found a helmet, belt buckles, and the weapons of an ocean explorer.</t1332> <t1333>In the Caribbean Sea, he had seen the ghost of the pirate Victor Hugo's ship, with its tattered sail and worm-eaten hull, forever lost on its way to the island of Guadeloupe.</t1333> <t1334>Sitting at the table, Úrsula sobbed as if she were reading letters never sent to her, in which José Arcadio recounted his triumphs and failures. "Here, the houses are so spacious, my child," she wept, "and there's so much food that we have to throw it to the pigs.</t1334> <t1335>But you're never home for me to rely on..."</t1335> <t1336>Yet deep down, she couldn't accept that the boy taken away by the gypsies had become this crude man who devoured half a suckling pig at lunch and whose hot breath withered the plants.</t1336> <t1337>The other family members thought similarly of him.</t1337> <t1338>Amaranta couldn't hide her disgust whenever he burped at the table.</t1338> <t1339>Arcadio, who never knew of his father-son relationship with José Arcadio, barely responded to his attempts to win his son's affection.</t1339> <t1340>Aureliano tried to revive the old days when they shared a room and reminisced about their childhood pranks, but José Arcadio had forgotten everything, as his sailor's life, filled with countless memories, had saturated his mind.</t1340> <t1341>Only Rebeca submitted to him from the very first moment.</t1341> <t1342>That afternoon, seeing him pass by her window, she thought Pietro Crespi was just a plump man compared to the extremely robust José Arcadio, whose volcanic breath filled the house.</t1342> <t1343>She found excuses to be near him.</t1343> <t1344>There were times when José Arcadio shamelessly ogled her body and said, "You are very womanly, my dear."</t1344> <t1345>Rebeca could no longer control herself.</t1345> <t1346>She resumed eating earth and wall lime with the same craving as before and sucked her thumb until it became calloused.</t1346> <t1347>She vomited a green liquid mixed with clotted blood.</t1347> <t1348>All night she lay awake, trembling with fever, battling her longing, waiting for dawn; the whole house shook with José Arcadio's footsteps as he returned.</t1348>
<t1349>One afternoon, while the whole family was taking a nap, she couldn't bear it any longer and sneaked into José Arcadio's bedroom.</t1349> <t1350>She saw him awake, wearing shorts, lying on a hammock tied with large iron rings and ship ropes.</t1350> <t1351>His muscular bare body moved her so much that she instinctively stopped and intended to leave.</t1351> <t1352>"Sorry"… she stammered, "I didn't know you were here".</t1352> <t1353>But she lowered her voice immediately so as not to wake anyone else.</t1353> <t1354>"Come in," he said.</t1354> <t1355>Rebeca obediently complied.</t1355> <t1356>She stood right next to the hammock, sweating coldly, feeling her stomach knotting up, while José Arcadio caressed her wrist with his five fingers, then her groin, then her buttocks, whispering: "Oh, little one.</t1356> <t1357>Oh, little one."</t1357> <t1358>The girl had to muster all her strength to avoid dying when a storm-like but very gentle force lifted her by the waist, undressed her, and laid her down like a small bird.</t1358> <t1359>She only had time to thank God for her existence before her consciousness was submerged in the soft, ecstatic pleasure that overwhelmed the pain, making her writhe in the steaming hammock.</t1359> <t1360>The hammock, like a blotting paper, immediately absorbed the blood from her virginity.</t1360>
<t1361>Three days later, they held the wedding ceremony during the mass at five in the afternoon.</t1361> <t1362>The day before that, Arcadio had gone to Pietro Crespi's shop.</t1362> <t1363>He found Pietro Crespi teaching a student to play the guitar and did not discreetly call him aside to talk.</t1363> <t1364>"I'm marrying Rebeca," he said.</t1364> <t1365>Pietro Crespi turned pale, handed the guitar to a student, and dismissed the class in the middle of the lesson.</t1365> <t1366>When only the two of them were left in the room filled with musical instruments and wind-up toys, Pietro Crespi said:</t1366>
<t1367>- Rebecca is your sister!</t1367>
<t1368>- To me, that doesn't matter, - José Arcadio replied.</t1368>
<t1369>Piêtrô Crêspi took out a lavender-scented handkerchief to wipe the sweat from his forehead.</t1369>
<t1370>- Taking it that way is against the laws of nature, he explained, - besides, the law strictly prohibits such a marriage.</t1370>
<t1371>- Oh, I don't care about your so-called natural order, - said José Arcadio.</t1371> <t1372>- I'm here to let you know so you won't bother Rebeca with questions.</t1372>
<t1373>Although his rude behavior had to disappear when he saw Pietro Crespi with tears in his eyes.</t1373> <t1374>"Now, here's the deal," he changed his tone, "if you still have feelings for my family, then Amaranta will be yours."</t1374>
<t1375>In the Sunday sermon, Father Nicanor demonstrated that José Arcadio and Rebeca were not biological siblings.</t1375>
<t1376>Ursula never forgave what she considered to be excessive rudeness, and when they returned from the church, she barred the newlyweds from entering the house.</t1376> <t1377>To her, they were now like the dead.</t1377> <t1378>So they bought a small house in front of the cemetery and moved to their new home without taking any furniture except for José Arcadio's hammock.</t1378>
<t1379>On their wedding night, Rebecca was bitten on the foot by a scorpion that had somehow gotten into her slipper.</t1379> <t1380>She was left speechless, but that didn't make their honeymoon any less enjoyable.</t1380> <t1381>The neighbors were startled by the screams that woke the entire neighborhood up to eight times in one night and three times in one afternoon, and they prayed that this excessive frenzy wouldn't disturb the dead resting peacefully in the tranquil cemetery nearby.</t1381>
<t1382>Aureliano was the only one worried about them.</t1382> <t1383>He bought some supplies and provided them with financial assistance until José Arcadio took a more realistic view of life and began to clear the unclaimed land adjacent to the yard.</t1383> <t1384>In contrast, Amaranta never ceased to hold a grudge against Rebeca, even though life had brought her unexpected joy.</t1384> <t1385>That joy was Pietro Crespi, who, with a calm and noble demeanor hiding his heartbreak, continued to have lunch with the family every Tuesday at Ursula's suggestion, as she still didn't know how to ease her embarrassment.</t1385> <t1386>Still wearing the black ribbon on his hat as a sign of his closeness to the family, he enjoyed expressing his admiration for Ursula by bringing her exotic gifts: Portuguese sardines, Turkish delight, and on special occasions, even a precious Manila shawl.</t1386> <t1387>Amaranta, with affectionate feelings, pampered him.</t1387> <t1388>She guessed his preferences, meticulously mended every loose thread on his sleeves, and to celebrate his birthday, she hemmed and embroidered their initials on a dozen handkerchiefs.</t1388> <t1389>On Tuesdays, after lunch, while Amaranta sat in the hallway, he always stayed by her side, chatting cheerfully.</t1389> <t1390>One Tuesday afternoon, when no one suspected what was about to happen, it happened: Pietro Crespi proposed to her.</t1390> <t1391>The girl continued to embroider calmly.</t1391> <t1392>Waiting for the heat in her ears to subside, she replied in an adult tone:</t1392>
<t1393>- Whatever, Crêspi, but let's wait until we really understand each other.</t1393> <t1394>There's no need to rush.</t1394>
<t1395>Ursula became confused.</t1395> <t1396>Although she had great respect for Pietro Crespi, she still couldn't determine whether, from a moral standpoint, her decision was good or bad, especially since this happened right after Pietro Crespi's prolonged and tumultuous relationship with Rebeca.</t1396> <t1397>However, she accepted that love, considering it an event that didn't require consulting others because at that time, no one shared her worries.</t1397> <t1398>Aureliano, who was now the authoritative man in the family, made her even more bewildered with his assertive and incomprehensible opinion:</t1398>
<t1399>- Now is not the time to discuss marriage.</t1399>
<t1400>In the following months, Úrsula finally understood that the statement was the only sincere answer that Aureliano could have given at that moment.</t1400> <t1401>It was not only a response to the matter of marriage but also to any issue unrelated to the war.</t1401> <t1402>When facing the execution squad's rifles, even he did not fully understand why a series of ironic coincidences had led him to that situation.</t1402> <t1403>The death of Remedios did not lead him to a terrifying agitation.</t1403> <t1404>Rather, it was merely a silent anger that gradually seeped into a quiet and lonely despondency, similar to the despondency he felt during the days he resolved to remain single.</t1404>
<t1405>He immersed himself in work again but still kept the habit of visiting his father-in-law to play dominoes: "Aureliano, get married," his father-in-law told him.</t1405> <t1406>"I have six daughters for you to choose from."</t1406> <t1407>Once, perhaps the event occurred before the election day, Don Apolinar Moscote returned to the village from the province, full of anxiety about the political situation of the country.</t1407> <t1408>The Liberals were ready to plunge into the fight.</t1408> <t1409>Since Aureliano still had vague notions about the differences between the Conservatives and the Liberals at that time, his father-in-law explained the general outlines to him.</t1409>
<t1410>Free men, he said, are Masons, wicked people who support hanging priests, advocate equal marriage and divorce, recognize the equality of illegitimate and legitimate children, and favor dividing the country into states that are federated to strip local powers and concentrate them in the supreme government.</t1410><t1411>In contrast, the Royalists, who have received power directly from God, protect the established public order and family morals, are the defenders of Christ, protect the foundations of power, and do not allow the country to be divided into free states.</t1411><t1412>Due to humanitarian sentiments, Aureliano sympathized with the liberal attitude of recognizing the rights of illegitimate children, but in any case, he could not understand why people had to go to war over intangible matters.</t1412><t1413>He felt his father-in-law was being extreme when he requested his superiors to send six soldiers under the command of a sergeant to Macondo, a village without political passions, to protect the election.</t1413><t1414>The soldiers not only came to the village, but they also went house to house, confiscating hunting weapons, machetes, and even kitchen knives, before distributing to men aged twenty-one and over a green ballot with the names of the Royalist candidates and a pink ballot with the names of the Liberal candidates.</t1414><t1415>Before the election day, Apolinar Moscote himself read a decree prohibiting the sale of liquor and gatherings of more than three people unless they were from the same household for forty-eight hours starting from midnight on Saturday.</t1415><t1416>The election proceeded smoothly.</t1416><t1417>As early as eight o'clock on Sunday morning, a wooden box guarded by six soldiers was placed in the square.</t1417><t1418>People voted freely, just as Aureliano could see for himself when he, along with his father-in-law, stood guard all day to ensure that no one could vote more than once.</t1418><t1419>At four in the afternoon, a drum roll in the square signaled the end of the election day, and Apolinar Moscote sealed the ballot box with a cross-marked tape bearing his signature.</t1419><t1420>That night, while playing dominoes with Aureliano, he ordered the sergeant to open the box and count the votes.</t1420><t1421>The number of pink and green ballots was roughly equal, but the sergeant left only ten pink ballots and replaced the rest with green ones to make up the difference.</t1421><t1422>Then the sergeant resealed the ballot box with a new label, and the next morning it was hurriedly taken to the provincial capital.</t1422><t1423>"The Liberals will rise up in civil war," Aureliano said.</t1423><t1424>Apolinar did not take his eyes off his domino tiles.</t1424><t1425>"If you mean because of the ballot change, they won't rise up," he said, "some pink ballots were left to keep them from complaining."</t1425><t1426>Aureliano understood the disadvantages of the opposing side.</t1426><t1427>"If I were a Liberal," he said, "I would rise up precisely because of this ballot change."</t1427><t1428>His father-in-law looked at him over his glasses.</t1428>
<t1429>- Oh Aureliano, - he said, - if you belong to the Liberal party, even if you are my son-in-law, you will never be able to witness the changing of the vote here.</t1429>
<t1430>In reality, what caused public outrage was not the election results but the fact that the soldiers did not return the weapons. A group of women spoke with Aureliano, asking him to request his father-in-law to return their kitchen knives.</t1430> <t1431>Don Apolinar Moscote, with utmost caution, explained to him that the soldiers had taken the confiscated weapons as evidence that the Liberals were preparing for war.</t1431> <t1432>The brazenness of that response shocked him.</t1432> <t1433>He did not comment, but one night, when Hernando Márquez and Magnífico Visbal were discussing the trouble over the knives with some friends, they asked him which side he belonged to: Liberal or Royalist. Without hesitation, he replied:</t1433>
<t1434>- If I have to choose between the two factions, I will side with the Liberals, - he said, - because the Royalists are swindlers.</t1434>
<t1435>The very next day, at the request of his friends, he went to see Dr. Alirio Noguera to have him examine his liver pain.</t1435><t1436>He didn't even know why he was doing it.</t1436><t1437>Dr. Alino Noguera had come to the village of Macondo a few years ago, bringing with him a cabinet of tasteless pills and an unconvincing advertisement sign: Fight poison with poison.</t1437><t1438>In reality, it was a joke.</t1438><t1439>Behind the mild exterior of a mediocre doctor was the face of a terrorist who wore knee-high boots to cover the scars on his ankles, marks from five years in prison.</t1439><t1440>From the very first federalist adventure, he had been arrested, escaped to Curaçao disguised in the clothes he hated most in the world: a priest's cassock.</t1440><t1441>After a long exile, filled with excitement by the news brought by exiles from all over the Caribbean to Curaçao, he sneaked onto a smuggling ship and then appeared in Riohacha with a cabinet of pills, which were actually just refined sugar tablets, and a fake medical degree from the University of Leipzig that he had forged himself: He wept bitterly.</t1441><t1442>The revolutionary fervor of the federalists, defined by the exiles as a powder keg about to explode, gradually cooled in the illusion of futile elections.</t1442><t1443>Bitter from that failure, longing for a safe place to spend his old age, the doctor who treated illness with illness fled to the village of Macondo.</t1443><t1444>In a cramped room filled with empty bottles, rented from across the square, he lived for several years with an incurable disease, convincing himself that he could be consoled with sugar pills.</t1444><t1445>His rebellious spirit had settled as Apolinar Moscote became more of a puppet authority.</t1445><t1446>Time passed, and he lived in reminiscence, treating asthma.</t1446><t1447>The upcoming election was the trigger for him to find a way to act rebelliously again.</t1447><t1448>He had close relations with the village youth, who were very politically unaware, and threw himself into secret rebellious activities.</t1448><t1449>The majority of the pink ballots in the box were from the enthusiastic youth. This was part of his plan: to force his disciples to vote to show them that elections were a farce. "The only thing that works," he said, "is violence."</t1449><t1450>Most of Aureliano's friends were eager to sweep away the royalist regime, but none dared to involve him in the plan, not only because of his relationship with his father-in-law but also because of his solitary and indifferent nature.</t1450><t1451>Moreover, they knew he had voted green as directed by his father-in-law.</t1451><t1452>So it was merely a coincidence that revealed his political thoughts, and it was a completely curious impulse that led him to the absurd idea of visiting the doctor to treat a non-existent ailment.</t1452><t1453>In the cramped room reeking of cheap camphor, there was a man who looked exactly like a moldy iguana wheezing. Before he could ask anything, the doctor pulled him to the window and examined his lower eyelid.</t1453><t1454>"It's not there," Aureliano said, following his friends' instructions.</t1454><t1455>Pressing his finger on his abdomen where his liver was, he said, "This is where it hurts so much I can't sleep."</t1455><t1456>So Dr. Noguera closed the window, claiming it was too bright, and in simple terms explained to him why eliminating the royalists was a patriot's duty.</t1456><t1457>For several days, Aureliano carried a tube of pills in his shirt pocket.</t1457><t1458>Every two hours, he would take out the tube, pour three pills into his palm, and pop them all into his mouth, letting them dissolve slowly on his tongue.</t1458><t1459>Apolinar Moscote mocked his faith in the method of treating illness with illness, but those plotting rebellion recognized him as one of their own.</t1459><t1460>Almost all the sons of Macondo's founders were in the secret organization, but none knew exactly how the actions they were preparing would unfold.</t1460><t1461>However, on the day the doctor revealed the secret to Aureliano, he volunteered to join the uprising.</t1461><t1462>Although he agreed at the time that the royalist regime had to be quickly destroyed, the doctor's plan of action disgusted him.</t1462><t1463>Dr. Noguera was a great fan of individual terrorism.</t1463><t1464>His method of action involved coordinating a series of individual acts so that in a large-scale national uprising, the royalist officials and their entire families, especially their children, would be exterminated to eradicate the royalist lineage.</t1464><t1465>Of course, Apolinar Moscote, his wife, and daughters were all on the terrorist list.</t1465>
<t1466>- You are neither a Liberal nor anything else - Aureliano said calmly, - you are a murderer, nothing more, nothing less.</t1466>
<t1467>- In that case, - the doctor said calmly, - please return the tube of medicine to me.</t1467> <t1468>You don't need it anymore.</t1468>
<t1469>Six months later, Aureliano learned that the doctor did not believe he was a man of action, had no hope for him, considering him a sentimental person, overly gentle and lonely.</t1469> <t1470>They tried to monitor him because they feared he would reveal the rebellion plans.</t1470> <t1471>To put them at ease, Aureliano promised not to say a word.</t1471> <t1472>But the night they came to assassinate the Moscote family, they found him standing guard at the entrance.</t1472> <t1473>He showed such a decisive attitude that the assassination plan had to be postponed indefinitely. It was during these days that Úrsula asked his opinion about the marriage of Pietro Crespi and Amaranta, and he replied that now was not the time to think about it.</t1473> <t1474>For more than a week, he had been hiding an old-fashioned revolver under his shirt, always on guard against his friends.</t1474> <t1475>In the afternoon, he would go to drink coffee with José Arcadio and Rebeca, who were now starting to decorate their house, and then from seven in the evening, he would play dominoes with his father-in-law.</t1475>
<t1476>At lunchtime, he talked with Arcadio, who was now a robust young man, and noticed that the young man increasingly showed eager enthusiasm for the impending civil war.</t1476> <t1477>Arcadio had kindled a fervent admiration for the idea of freedom in the school, where he had gathered not only older students but also young children who could barely speak.</t1477> <t1478>The young man spoke about shooting Father Nicanor, turning the church into a school, and recognizing sexual freedom.</t1478> <t1479>Aureliano was worried about his nephew's violent ideas.</t1479> <t1480>He advised him to be cautious and discreet.</t1480> <t1481>Ignoring his uncle's sensible arguments and practical thoughts, Arcadio openly criticized his uncle's cowardice.</t1481> <t1482>Aureliano waited and waited.</t1482> <t1483>Finally, at the beginning of December, Úrsula suddenly rushed into the goldsmith's workshop in a panic:</t1483>
<t1484>- Civil war has broken out!</t1484>
<t1485>Indeed, the civil war had been raging for three months.</t1485> <t1486>The curfew law was enforced nationwide.</t1486> <t1487>Don Apolinar Moscote was the only one who knew in time that the fighting had broken out, but he didn't reveal it even to his wife, while a platoon of soldiers had rushed in to occupy the village and set up a garrison.</t1487> <t1488>The soldiers quietly entered the village before dawn, bringing with them two light cannons pulled by mules, and established a garrison right at the school.</t1488> <t1489>They blew the curfew horn as early as six in the evening.</t1489> <t1490>This time, they searched each house more terrifyingly than before, confiscating everything from sickles onwards.</t1490> <t1491>They dragged Dr. Noguera away, tied him to a tree, and shot him without trial.</t1491> <t1492>Father Nicanor wanted to awe the military authorities with his mystical ability to levitate, but a soldier struck him on the head with the butt of his rifle, causing it to bleed.</t1492> <t1493>The excitement of the Liberals was extinguished in silent anxiety.</t1493> <t1494>Aureliano, pale and inscrutable, continued to play dominoes with his father-in-law.</t1494> <t1495>He understood that although Don Apolinar Moscote was nominally the leader of civil and military affairs in the village, he was once again just a puppet official.</t1495> <t1496>All matters in the village were decided by an army captain.</t1496> <t1497>Every morning, this captain personally collected extraneous taxes to fund the maintenance of public security.</t1497> <t1498>Four soldiers under his command looted the home of a woman bitten by a rabid dog and beat her to death with rifle butts right in the middle of the street.</t1498> <t1499>Two weeks after the soldiers occupied the village, one Sunday, Aureliano walked into Herinendo Marquez's house with his usual dazed look and asked for a cup of coffee without sugar.</t1499> <t1500>When they were alone, unlike on other days, Aureliano authoritatively said, "Prepare the boys, we are going to war."</t1500> <t1501>Herinendo Marquez, still in disbelief, asked:</t1501>
<t1502>- Where do we get weapons from?</t1502>
<t1503>- Take it from them, - Aureliano replied.</t1503>
<t1504>At midnight on the third day, during a fierce battle, twenty-one men under thirty years old, under the command of Aureliano, all armed with kitchen knives and pointed iron bars, suddenly ambushed the guards, seized their weapons, and shot dead the captain and four soldiers who had killed the innocent woman right in the yard.</t1504>
<t1505>That night, as the order to disarm the execution squad echoed, Accadio was appointed as the commander of military and civil affairs of the village.</t1505> <t1506>The militia members who had wives barely had time to bid farewell to their spouses before leaving, leaving the women to fend for themselves.</t1506>
<t1507>They left at dawn, cheered on by the entire village, having escaped the horrors, to join the armed forces of General Victorio Medina, a revolutionary.</t1507> <t1508>According to the latest news, he is operating in the Manaure area. Before leaving, Aureliano released old Apolinar Moscote from the iron cage.</t1508>
<t1509>"Please stay calm," he said to his father-in-law, "the new government, with their word of honor, will ensure the safety of you and the entire family."</t1509> <t1510>It was very difficult for Don Apolinar Moscote to recognize the revolutionary, wearing high boots and a gun at his hip, as the same person who used to play dominoes with him until nine in the evening.</t1510>
<t1511>- Is this a joke, Aureliano? - he exclaimed.</t1511>
<t1512>- I'm not joking, - Aureliano said, - this is a real war.</t1512> <t1513>Please don't call me just Aureliano anymore, because I am now Colonel Aureliano Buendía.</t1513>
<t1514>Chapter 6</t1514>
<t1515>Colonel Aureliano Buendía launched thirty-two armed uprisings and failed completely.</t1515> <t1516>Having relations with seventeen girls in different villages, he fathered seventeen sons, all of whom were killed one by one in a single night before the eldest turned thirty-five. He survived fourteen assassination attempts, seventy-three ambushes, and a firing squad.</t1516> <t1517>He survived poisoning by strychnine powder mixed in his coffee in a dose sufficient to kill a horse.</t1517> <t1518>He refused the Order of Merit awarded by the President of the Republic.</t1518> <t1519>He became the Commander-in-Chief of the revolutionary armed forces, wielding authority from one country to another, and made the government wary, but he never allowed anyone to photograph him.</t1519> <t1520>He declined the pension due to him after the war and lived to old age thanks to the goldfish he produced in his jewelry workshop in the village of Macondo. Although he always led his army in battle, the only wound on his body was self-inflicted after signing the Neclandia truce, ending twenty years of civil war.</t1520> <t1521>He shot himself in the chest with a revolver, and the bullet exited through his back without harming any vital organs.</t1521> <t1522>The only thing that remained from twenty years of civil war was a street in Macondo named after him.</t1522> <t1523>However, according to his declaration a few years before dying of old age, even that was not what he had hoped for on the morning he and twenty-one strong young men set out to join the armed forces of General Victoriano Medina.</t1523>
<t1524>- We are leaving Macondo to you, - that is all he said to Arcadio before setting off.</t1524> <t1525>- we are pleased to leave it to you.</t1525> <t1526>So try to take care of it so that when we return, we find it better.</t1526>
<t1527>Accadio responded to that advice in his own way.</t1527> <t1528>He tailored a military uniform with marshal's epaulets and fringes, modeled after the illustrations in Menkyadet's book, and strapped to his waist the gold-inlaid sword of the executed captain.</t1528> <t1529>He placed two cannons right at the village gate, dressed his former students—who had been driven mad by his fiery proclamations—in uniforms, and had them swagger around the village armed, giving strangers the impression that this was an impregnable military position.</t1529> <t1530>It was a double-edged game because it prevented the government from daring to attack the square for ten months, but it also meant that when the government did order an attack, the military used such overwhelming force that they crushed the resistance within half an hour.</t1530>
<t1531>From the very first day of exercising his power, Accadio revealed himself to be an arrogant person.</t1531> <t1532>Every day, he would read orders until four in the afternoon to command and arrange everything according to his will.</t1532> <t1533>He enforced military conscription on those aged eighteen and above, declared the requisition of any animals still wandering the streets after six in the evening, and required elderly men to wear a red armband.</t1533>
<t1534>Imprisoning Father Nicanor in the monastery with the threat of shooting him and forbidding him from performing mass and ringing the bells unless it was to celebrate the victory of the Liberal faction.</t1534> <t1535>To ensure that no one doubted the seriousness of his policies, he ordered a firing squad to practice shooting at a scarecrow in the square right in front of the public.</t1535> <t1536>At first, no one took it seriously.</t1536> <t1537>It was just the students playing at being adults.</t1537> <t1538>But one night, when Arcadio entered Catarino's restaurant, the trumpet player greeted him with a mocking fanfare that made the crowd burst into laughter, so he ordered the man to be shot for disrespecting authority.</t1538> <t1539>For those who dared to oppose him, he ordered them to be handcuffed and locked in a jail that was once a classroom, feeding them only bland bread and water. "You are a murderer," Ursula scolded him whenever she learned of a new act of cruelty by her grandson.</t1539> <t1540>"If Aureliano knew, he would kill you, and I would be the first in this village to feel satisfied." But her scoldings were in vain.</t1540> <t1541>Arcadio continued to tighten the screws of his oppressive machine until he became the bloodiest authority Macondo had ever seen. "Now we suffer from the struggle," Don Apolinar Moscote said on several occasions: "This is the Paradise of the Liberals."</t1541> <t1542>Arcadio knew.</t1542> <t1543>Leading a squad of soldiers, he broke into houses, smashed furniture, beat the daughters, and dragged Don Apolinar Moscote along.</t1543> <t1544>Just as Arcadio was about to personally order the firing squad to shoot Don Apolinar Moscote, Ursula, after angrily shouting and waving a tarred leather whip to part the crowd, made a commotion in the barracks yard: "You scoundrel, have some respect!" Before Arcadio could react, she lashed him with the whip, "You murderer.</t1544> <t1545>You are too insolent," she screamed.</t1545> <t1546>"You might as well kill me too, you scoundrel.</t1546> <t1547>That way, I won't have to cry in shame for having raised a traitor."</t1547> <t1548>She continued to whip him mercilessly, chasing him to the end of the yard, making him squirm like a snail.</t1548> <t1549>Don Apolinar Moscote stood petrified, tied to the post where the scarecrows had previously been blown to bits by the firing squad's bullets.</t1549>
<t1550>The boys of the execution squad scattered because they were afraid Ursula would beat them to death.</t1550> <t1551>But she didn't even look at them.</t1551> <t1552>Leaving Arcadio in his disheveled, ragged military uniform, groaning in pain and anger, she went to untie Don Apolinar Moscote and led him home.</t1552> <t1553>Before leaving the barracks, she also released the political prisoners.</t1553>
<t1554>Since that time, she has been the ruler of Macondo village.</t1554> <t1555>She restored the Sunday mass, abolished the wearing of red armbands, and disbanded the violent patrols.</t1555> <t1556>But during her moments of rest, she still lamented her unfortunate fate.</t1556> <t1557>She felt so lonely that she had to seek out her forgotten husband under the chestnut tree. "My dear, look at our plight, isn't it tragic," she said to him as the July downpours threatened to topple the palm-leaf hut. "Look at the deserted house, our children scattered across the world, and once again it's just the two of us together like in the beginning."</t1557>
<t1558>José Arcadio Buendía was perpetually lost in a deep unconscious state, unresponsive as stone to her laments.</t1558> <t1559>In the early days of his madness, he would use incomprehensible Latin phrases to communicate his daily essential needs to everyone.</t1559> <t1560>During brief moments of lucidity, when Amaranta brought him food, he would inform her of his greatest discomforts, and he obediently took mustard seed medicine and allowed her to perform bloodletting.</t1560> <t1561>But during the period when Úrsula lamented beside him, he had completely lost the ability to interact with reality.</t1561> <t1562>He sat in the chair while she bathed him, one part at a time.</t1562> <t1563>As she bathed him, she told him stories about the household.</t1563> <t1564>"Aureliano has been at war for four months now, and we still haven't received any news about him," she said while scrubbing him with soap. "José Arcadio has returned; he is a real man, taller than even you, and covered in tattoos."</t1564> <t1565>"He came back only to bring shame to our family."</t1565> <t1566>However, she noticed that her husband seemed saddened by the bad news.</t1566> <t1567>So she changed her tone and began to lie to him, "Don't believe what I just said," she said, while sprinkling ashes over his excrement to scoop it up. "God wants José Arcadio and Rebeca to marry, and now they are living very happily."</t1567> <t1568>Then she became so sincere in her lies that she herself felt comforted by her own deceptions. "Arcadio has become a respectable young man," she said, "very brave and very handsome in his uniform with a sword at his side."</t1568> <t1569>All these words were spoken as if to a dead person, for José Arcadio Buendía was serene, very serene, beyond all worries and concerns.</t1569> <t1570>But she did not stop.</t1570> <t1571>She found him so gentle, so much like everyone else, that she untied him.</t1571> <t1572>He remained in the chair, as if the restraints were no longer necessary, because it seemed that a force stronger than any visible bonds had tied him to the chestnut tree.</t1572> <t1573>Around August, when the winter began to drag on, Úrsula was able to give him some news:</t1573>
<t1574>- Hey, luck is still with us, - she told him, - Amaranta and that Italian guy who fixed the automatic piano are going to get married.</t1574>
<t1575>Indeed, Amaranta and Pietro Crespi had a deep friendship.</t1575><t1576>Both were lovingly cared for by Úrsula.</t1576><t1577>This time she felt it was unnecessary to sit and watch over the young couple as they conversed.</t1577><t1578>It was a love in the twilight.</t1578><t1579>The Italian man, with an ivory white gardenia flower standing out on his lapel, would come to the house in the afternoon and translate Petrarch's sonnets into Spanish for Amaranta.</t1579><t1580>The two of them would sit in the hallway, thick with the scent of roses and begonias.</t1580><t1581>He read poetry, she wove lace, unaware of the shocking events and bad news from the front, until the mosquitoes bit them so fiercely that they had to run into the living room.</t1581><t1582>Amaranta's gentle affection, with her subtly tender words, was like an invisible spider web that gradually enveloped her beloved, so much so that by eight o'clock in the evening, he had to use his pale, ringed fingers to untangle himself and go home.</t1582><t1583>The two of them had made a wonderful album with postcards sent from Italy to Pietro Crespi.</t1583><t1584>These were photographs of lovers in secluded gardens, decorated with drawings of hearts pierced by arrows and golden ribbons entwining pairs of doves. "I know this park in Florence," he said, as he flipped through the postcards.</t1584><t1585>"As soon as one extends a hand, the birds immediately swoop down to eat."</t1585><t1586>Sometimes, in front of a nursery, nostalgia transformed the smell of mud and rotten fish in the canals of Venice into a gentle floral fragrance.</t1586><t1587>Amaranta sighed, laughed, and dreamed of a second homeland filled with magnificent young men and women speaking the language of children, in ancient cities whose former glory now only lingered in the form of cats prowling among the ruins.</t1587><t1588>After crossing the vast ocean in his quest, after mistaking it for the passionate moments with Rebeca, Pietro Crespi had now found love.</t1588><t1589>Joy brought with it wealth, and now his shop occupied nearly an entire block.</t1589><t1590>It was a gigantic, magical display case that restored Florentine alarm clocks, which, each time they struck the hour, would ring out a chorus of bells, sold Chinese powder boxes that delighted the fingers when opened, and offered every imaginable musical instrument and wind-up toy one could dream of.</t1590>
<t1591>Bruno Crespi, his youngest son, sat watching over the store because he was not yet capable of handling the music class.</t1591> <t1592>Thanks to Pietro Crespi, the Turkish street quickly transformed the splendid display of precious goods into a serene and melodious place to forget the brutal actions of Arcadio and the perpetual gloom of war.</t1592> <t1593>When Úrsula decided to restore the Sunday mass ceremonies, Pietro Crespi donated a children's organ to the church and prepared a song that would brighten Father Nicanor's somber mass.</t1593> <t1594>No one doubted anymore that Amaranta would be a happy wife.</t1594> <t1595>Allowing the feelings of the couple to naturally blossom from their hearts, without any urging, they reached the peak of love with only the wedding date left to be set.</t1595> <t1596>They did not encounter any obstacles.</t1596> <t1597>Úrsula silently blamed herself for the indefinite postponement of the wedding, which had altered Rebeca's fate.</t1597> <t1598>To this day, she had not yet overcome the shame.</t1598> <t1599>The serious mourning for Remedios had to take a back seat due to the deaths caused by the war, Aureliano's absence, Arcadio's brutality, and the expulsion of José Arcadio and Rebeca from the house.</t1599> <t1600>Before the upcoming wedding, it was Pietro Crespi who earnestly requested to consider Aureliano José, whom he cherished like his own child, as his firstborn.</t1600> <t1601>Everything made everyone think that Amaranta was heading towards an easy happiness.</t1601> <t1602>But, unlike Rebeca, she did not reveal the desires of her heart.</t1602> <t1603>With the same feeling she had while weaving tablecloths, lace trims, and embroidering peacocks on the cross, she waited for Pietro Crespi, unable to suppress the urgent demands of his heart.</t1603> <t1604>His fateful hour came during the unfortunate rainy days of October.</t1604> <t1605>Pietro Crespi removed her hand from the embroidery frame and held her hand in his for a long time. "I can't wait any longer," he told her.</t1605> <t1606>"Let's get married next month."</t1606> <t1607>Amaranta did not tremble when her hand touched his cold hand.</t1607> <t1608>She slowly withdrew her hand from his.</t1608> <t1609>Like an evasive animal, she resumed her work.</t1609>
<t1610>- Stop being so naive, Crespi, - she laughed.</t1610> <t1611>- Even if I die, I won't marry you.</t1611>
<t1612>Piêtrô Crêspi could not control himself.</t1612> <t1613>He cried uncontrollably, no longer feeling any shame, nearly crushing his fingers out of frustration.</t1613> <t1614>But he still could not sway her. "Don't waste any more time hesitating," that was all Amaranta could say.</t1614> <t1615>"If you truly love me deeply, then please do not come to this house anymore."</t1615> <t1616>Ursula felt as if she were going mad with shame.</t1616> <t1617>Piêtrô Crêspi used all his skills to plead, lowering himself to unimaginable levels.</t1617> <t1618>He cried like a child on Ursula's chest all night, who might have had to sell her soul to comfort him.</t1618>
<t1619>On rainy nights, people would find him wandering around the house with a silk umbrella, hoping to catch a glimpse of the light in Amaranta's room.</t1619> <t1620>He had never dressed as elegantly as he did then.</t1620> <t1621>His magnificent hair, like that of an emperor after a storm of emotions, had taken on a strange appearance.</t1621> <t1622>He intercepted Amaranta's friends, the girls who usually came to embroider on the porch, to ask them to persuade Amaranta.</t1622> <t1623>He no longer had the heart to take care of the shop.</t1623> <t1624>All day long, he stayed at home writing tedious letters to send to Amaranta along with dried flowers and butterflies.</t1624> <t1625>But she returned them unopened.</t1625> <t1626>Shutting himself in his room, he sat for days on end playing the lute.</t1626> <t1627>One night, he sang.</t1627> <t1628>Macondo awoke in a special kind of astonishment, feeling chosen by the gods, as the sound of the lute resonated mournfully, not from this world, accompanied by a voice filled with such love that it seemed impossible to exist on this earth.</t1628> <t1629>It was then that Pietro Crespi saw light coming from the windows of every house in the village except Amaranta's room.</t1629> <t1630>On November second, All Souls' Day, his younger brother opened the shop and found all the lights on, all the music boxes open, all the clocks stopped at an eternal hour, and amidst this chaotic scene, he saw Pietro Crespi sitting at the writing table in the back room with his fingers cut and soaked in a basin of cochineal dye.</t1630>
<t1631>Ursula decided to keep her brother's body in her house for the funeral rites.</t1631><t1632>Father Nicanor refused to perform the baptism and bury him in the holy ground.</t1632><t1633>Ursula confronted the priest. "Neither you nor I can understand that this man is a saint," she said.</t1633><t1634>"Against your wishes, I will bury him right next to Melquiades' grave."</t1634><t1635>She did exactly what she said.</t1635><t1636>With the support of the entire village, she organized a solemn funeral for him.</t1636><t1637>Amaranta did not step out of her room.</t1637><t1638>Lying on her bed, she clearly heard Ursula's crying, the footsteps and the sobbing murmurs of the crowd, the eerie wails of the hired mourners echoing into the house, and then the quiet, solemn scene laden with the scent of trampled flowers.</t1638><t1639>Ursula abandoned her.</t1639><t1640>That very afternoon, Amaranta went into the kitchen, thrust her hand into the glowing embers, and left it there until she no longer felt pain but only the acrid smell of her own flesh burning, yet her mother did not even lift her eyes to pity her daughter.</t1640><t1641>It was an effective remedy for the torment of remorse.</t1641><t1642>For several days, with her burnt hand soaking in a bowl of egg whites, she walked around the house, and as the egg whites healed the burns, it seemed they also healed the burns in her heart.</t1642><t1643>The only external trace left of the tragedy was the black bandage on her burnt hand, which she had to wear until her death.</t1643>
<t1644>Through the official order to mourn Pietro Crespi, Arcadio particularly showed himself to be a noble person.</t1644> <t1645>Úrsula explained this phenomenon as the return of a lost sheep.</t1645> <t1646>But she was greatly mistaken.</t1646> <t1647>She had lost Arcadio not just since he wore the military uniform but long before that.</t1647> <t1648>She thought she was raising him like a son, like she raised Rebeca, neither too indulgently nor too harshly.</t1648> <t1649>However, Arcadio was a lonely and frightened child during the time of the insomnia plague, in the circumstances where Úrsula was busy getting rich, José Arcadio Buendía was insane, Aureliano was taciturn, and Amaranta and Rebeca were hostile to each other.</t1649> <t1650>Aureliano taught him to read and write, but his mind was elsewhere, as if he was turning him into a stranger.</t1650> <t1651>He gave him clothes that were about to tear for Visitación to mend to fit.</t1651> <t1652>Arcadio suffered with shoes that were too big, with mended pants, and with his womanly hips.</t1652> <t1653>He never confided in anyone except Visitación and Cataure in their language.</t1653> <t1654>In fact, Melquíades was the only one who cared about him.</t1654> <t1655>He recited incomprehensible elegies to him and explained the art of photography to him.</t1655> <t1656>No one knew how he cried silently over Melquíades' death and tried to revive him by studying his writings without success.</t1656> <t1657>The school, where he worked diligently and was respected by everyone, and later the authority given to him with decisive orders and the glorious military uniform, those things freed him from his previous bitterness.</t1657> <t1658>One night, right in Catarino's store, someone dared to say to him: "You are not worthy of your name!".</t1658> <t1659>Contrary to what everyone expected, Arcadio did not order that person to be shot:</t1659>
<t1660>- Very pleased, - he said.</t1660> <t1661>- Fortunately, I'm not a Buendía.</t1661>
<t1662>Those who knew his origins through this argument all thought that he had understood.</t1662> <t1663>In reality, he still had no idea about his origins.</t1663> <t1664>Pila Tecnêra, his mother, who had once aroused his lust in the darkroom, was an irresistible craving for him, just as she had been initially for José Arcadio and later for Aureliano. Although she had lost her former charm and infectious laughter, he still sought her out and found her in the acrid smoke emanating from her body.</t1664> <t1665>But before the outbreak of hostilities, one afternoon when she came to the school later than usual to find her youngest son, Arcadio was waiting for her in the lounge, which later became a prison cell.</t1665> <t1666>While the child was playing outside in the yard, he lay in the hammock waiting for her, trembling with renewed desire and knowing that she would come.</t1666> <t1667>She did come.</t1667> <t1668>Arcadio grabbed her wrist, intending to pull her into the hammock with him.</t1668>
<t1669>"I give up! I give up!", Pila Tecnêra said, trembling with fear.</t1669> <t1670>"You don't know that I also want to please you very much.</t1670> <t1671>But with God as my witness: I cannot satisfy you."</t1671>
<t1672>With inherited strength, Accadio wrapped his arms around her waist and felt the world tilt when he touched her skin.</t1672> <t1673>"Stop it, don't pretend to be all high and mighty...", he said.</t1673> <t1674>"In the end, everyone knows I'm a prostitute."</t1674>
<t1675>Pila Tecnera could not overcome the shame that the tragic fate had bestowed upon her.</t1675>
<t1676>- The children will disappear, - she said.</t1676> <t1677>- It's best if you leave the door open tonight.</t1677>
<t1678>That night, lying on the hammock, his body burning as if on fire, Arcadio waited for her.</t1678><t1679>He did not sleep, waiting and listening to the sounds of the late night and the cries of the night heron.</t1679><t1680>The longer he waited, the more hopeless he felt, thinking he had been "fooled."</t1680><t1681>Just as his desire began to cool and his anger flared up, the door suddenly opened.</t1681><t1682>Months later, standing before the firing squad, Arcadio recalled the staggering footsteps in the classroom, the collisions with the benches, and finally, a shadowy figure emerging in the dim room and the pounding heart that was not his own.</t1682><t1683>He reached out his hand and encountered another hand wearing two rings on the same finger of a person about to drown in darkness.</t1683><t1684>He felt his blood pulsing through his veins, his misfortune beating erratically, and his hand, with a lifeline cut short by death on the thumb mound, was damp with sweat.</t1684><t1685>Thus, he immediately understood that this woman was not the one he had been waiting for, because she did not emit the expected burnt smell but rather the scent of brigantine, because she had wrinkled breasts, a firm and round navel like a grape seed, and a body trembling with the fear of someone inexperienced in life.</t1685><t1686>She was a virgin and had an almost unbelievable name: Santa Sofía de la Piedad.</t1686><t1687>Pilar Ternera paid her fifty pesos, half of the money she had saved all her life, to do what she was doing.</t1687><t1688>Arcadio had seen her many times while tending his parents' grocery store, and he had never paid attention to her because she was not yet in her prime.</t1688><t1689>But from that day on, he clung to her like a cat.</t1689><t1690>She came to the school during lunch breaks with the complicity of her parents, who had received the rest of Pilar Ternera's savings.</t1690><t1691>Later, when the government troops expelled them from the school, the two made love among the butter barrels and corn sacks in the warehouse.</t1691><t1692>During the time Arcadio was appointed Military and Civil Governor of Macondo, they had a daughter together.</t1692>
<t1693>The only close relatives who knew about it were José Arcadio and Rebeca.</t1693> <t1694>They were the ones with whom Arcadio at that time maintained intimate relations not only based on kinship but also on complicity.</t1694> <t1695>The marital yoke completely subdued José Arcadio.</t1695> <t1696>Rebeca's strong character, her gluttonous appetite, and her insatiable greed drained the robust strength of her husband, forcing him, who was lazy and a playboy, to become a hardworking giant.</t1696>
<t1697>He has a clean and tidy house.</t1697> <t1698>Every morning, Rebecca opens the doors wide, and the wind from the cemetery rushes through the windows and then sweeps out through the side door, leaving behind the sulfurous smell of the dead, causing the walls to turn pale and the tables, cabinets, and beds to darken.</t1698> <t1699>The hunger for land, the clattering sound of the bones of her parents, and her impatience with Pietro Crespi's overly calm demeanor had faded into the past.</t1699> <t1700>All day, she sat embroidering by the window, indifferent to the echoes of war.</t1700> <t1701>Only when the earthenware pots began to rattle in the cupboard did she get up to reheat the food.</t1701> <t1702>She did this before the appearance of the mud-splattered, sniffing dogs and the burly man in spurred boots, carrying a double-barreled musket: "This man sometimes carried a deer on his shoulders, but almost always brought back a string of rabbits or wild ducks… One afternoon, right when he took power, Arcadio suddenly came to visit them.</t1702> <t1703>When they left the house, they did not see him, but he had shown such warmth and friendliness that the couple invited him to stay and taste the freshly cooked game meat.</t1703>
<t1704>It was only when drinking coffee that Arcadio clearly stated the purpose of his visit: he had received a complaint against José Arcadio. The complaint alleged that José Arcadio plowed his own field and encroached on neighboring lands, broke down fences, herded his cattle into others' pens, and used force to seize the most fertile farms around.</t1704> <t1705>For those farmers who were not dispossessed because their lands were poor, he forced them to pay taxes.</t1705> <t1706>Every Saturday, he used hunting dogs and a double-barreled musket to collect taxes.</t1706> <t1707>He did not deny these accusations.</t1707> <t1708>He asserted his rights over the lands he had seized, which had been distributed by José Arcadio Buendía during the village's founding, and he believed he could prove that his father had been insane since that time because he had given away wealth that rightfully belonged to his family.</t1708> <t1709>It was an unnecessary argument because Arcadio had not come to adjudicate right or wrong but merely to negotiate.</t1709>
<t1710>As for himself, he established a law office to oversee private property, which would provide José Arcadio with the documents to legalize the lands he had seized, and in return, he had to allow the local government the right to collect taxes.</t1710> <t1711>The two agreed with each other.</t1711> <t1712>In later years, when Colonel Aureliano Buendía examined the land deeds, he found that all the land from José Arcadio's yard to the horizon, including the village cemetery, belonged to his brother; and that during the eleven months of his rule, Arcadio had collected not only taxes but also money from people who wanted to bury their loved ones on José Arcadio's estate.</t1712>
<t1713>A few months later, Úrsula finally learned about the matter that had become public knowledge, because the townspeople had hidden it from her to spare her further distress.</t1713> <t1714>She began to suspect him. "Arcadio is building a house," she proudly asserted to her husband while trying to shove a spoonful of pumpkin soup into his mouth.</t1714> <t1715>However, she unconsciously sighed: "I don't know why, but I feel uneasy about all these things."</t1715> <t1716>And later, when she found out that not only had Arcadio finished building the house but had also bought furniture made in Vienna, she became even more convinced that he was embezzling public funds, something she had previously suspected.</t1716>
<t1717>"You are the disgrace of our family," she scolded him like that at the end of the Sunday mass, when she saw him playing cards in the new house.</t1717> <t1718>Arcadio ignored her words.</t1718> <t1719>It was only then that Úrsula learned he had a six-month-old daughter and that Santa Sofía de la Piedad, the woman he was living with without being married, was pregnant again.</t1719>
<t1720>Ursula intended to write a letter to Colonel Aureliano Buendía, no matter where he was, to inform him of everything happening at home and in the neighborhood.</t1720> <t1721>But the tumultuous events at that time not only hindered all her intentions but also made her regret having gathered them.</t1721> <t1722>War, which until then had been just a word to describe an empty and stagnant situation, had materialized into a tragic reality.</t1722> <t1723>At the end of February, an old woman with white hair riding a broomstick horse arrived in the village of Macondo.</t1723> <t1724>She looked so gentle that the patrols let her into the village without questioning her, just as they had not questioned the peddlers who often passed through the villages around the swamp.</t1724> <t1725>She went straight to the barracks, where Arcadio received her right in what used to be the classroom and was now the soldiers' resting place, where hammocks were rolled up and hung on hooks, backpacks were piled up in corners, and rifles, carbines, and hunting guns were scattered all over the floor.</t1725> <t1726>The old woman saluted in a military manner before introducing herself:</t1726>
<t1727>- I am Colonel Gregory Stevenson.</t1727>
<t1728>He brings bad news.</t1728> <t1729>The last strongholds of the Liberal forces, according to him, are being destroyed.</t1729> <t1730>Colonel Aureliano Buendía, who is being pursued by the Royalist army on the outskirts of the city of Riohacha, has entrusted him with the mission to speak with Arcadio, advising him to surrender the square to the government forces under the condition that they honorably promise to ensure the safety and property of the Liberals.</t1730>
<t1731>Accađiô looked with suspicious eyes at the strange messenger, who could be mistaken for a frightened old woman fleeing.</t1731>
<t1732>- So may I ask if you have any documents with you? - he asked.</t1732>
<t1733>- Unfortunately, - the messenger replied, - I didn't bring it with me.</t1733> <t1734>It is understandable that under the current conditions, it is really difficult to carry anything on one's person that might arouse suspicion.</t1734>
<t1735>While speaking, he took a goldfish out of his chest pocket and placed it on the table.</t1735> <t1736>"I believe this will be more than sufficient," he said.</t1736> <t1737>Accadio confirmed that it was one of the goldfish made by Colonel Aureliano Buendía.</t1737> <t1738>But someone had either bought it before the war broke out or had stolen it, and thus it no longer held the value of a transit pass.</t1738> <t1739>At this point, the messenger was forced to violate military secrecy to reveal his true identity.</t1739> <t1740>He recounted that his mission was to go to Curaçao to recruit all the exiles from the entire Caribbean region, purchase enough weapons and military supplies to plan a landing by the end of the year.</t1740> <t1741>Although he trusted the plan, Colonel Aureliano Buendía did not agree that it was the right time to carry out such futile sacrificial activities.</t1741> <t1742>But Accadio was ruthless.</t1742> <t1743>He imprisoned the messenger to verify his background and decided to defend the square to the last breath.</t1743>
<t1744>No need to wait long.</t1744><t1745>News of the Liberal faction's failure became more and more certain.</t1745><t1746>In the early hours of a late March night, amidst early downpours, the heavy, quiet atmosphere of the previous weeks suddenly dissipated with the eerie sound of a cornet and the violent explosion of a cannon that brought down the church bell tower.</t1746><t1747>In reality, Arcadio's resolve to resist was a mad idea.</t1747><t1748>He had no more than fifty poorly armed men with no more than twenty bullets per gun.</t1748><t1749>But among the resistance fighters, his former students, who were once eager with his grand declarations, were determined to fight to the last moment for a lost cause.</t1749><t1750>In the midst of the chaotic sounds of running boots, conflicting orders, earth-shaking cannon blasts, random gunfire, and meaningless cornet calls, the imprisoned Colonel Stevenson requested to speak with Arcadio.</t1750><t1751>"Spare me the shame of dying in prison dressed in women's clothes," he said to him. "If I must die, I will die fighting."</t1751><t1752>Arcadio ordered a gun with twenty bullets to be given to him and allowed him, along with five others, to defend the barracks, while he and his command went to the front line of the resistance.</t1752><t1753>The barricades were broken, and the village defenders had to fight an uneven gun battle in the streets.</t1753><t1754>First, they fought with rifles until they ran out of bullets, then with pistols against rifles, and finally in hand-to-hand combat.</t1754><t1755>Facing imminent defeat, some women, wielding sticks and butcher knives, poured into the streets.</t1755><t1756>In that chaotic scene, Arcadio encountered Amaranta in her nightgown, holding two old pistols of José Arcadio Buendía, frantically searching for him.</t1756><t1757>Arcadio handed his gun to an officer who had lost his weapon in the battle, then slipped into a nearby alley with Amaranta to take her home.</t1757><t1758>Ursula stood at the doorway, waiting, despite the gunfire and a stray bullet that punched a hole in the front wall of the neighboring house.</t1758><t1759>The rain had stopped, but the main road was muddy like soap foam, and people had to feel their way in the darkness. Arcadio left Amaranta with Ursula and intended to face two government soldiers coming down the street to search.</t1759><t1760>The pistols, having been in the drawer for too long without oil, did not fire.</t1760><t1761>Shielding Arcadio with her body, Ursula tried to pull him back to her house.</t1761>
<t1762>- Come back immediately! For God's sake, come back home immediately - she shouted at him. - Stop this madness.</t1762>
<t1763>The soldiers fired bullets at them.</t1763>
<t1764>- Old woman, let go of that person, - a soldier shouted, - or we will not be responsible for your death.</t1764>
<t1765>Accadio pushed Ursula towards the house, while he raised his hands in surrender.</t1765>
<t1766>Shortly thereafter, the gunfire ceased abruptly and the church bells began to toll.</t1766> <t1767>The resistance was crushed in less than half an hour.</t1767>
<t1768>Not a single person from Akkad survived the attack, but before dying, they were all paraded in front of three hundred government soldiers.</t1768> <t1769>The last fortress to be destroyed was the military camp.</t1769>
<t1770>Before it was attacked, Colonel Gregory Stevenson, who was imprisoned, released all the prisoners and ordered his subordinates to go out and fight on the streets.</t1770> <t1771>The change in the combat position was as flexible as his, and the precise trajectory of the twenty bullets he fired from different windows gave the impression that the barracks were well-defended, forcing the attackers to use cannons to bring it down.</t1771> <t1772>The captain commanding the battle was astonished by the sight of the collapsed walls, with only one man, wearing nothing but shorts, dead, and a gun with no bullets being held by a severed arm.</t1772> <t1773>That man had thick, curly hair resting on his shoulders and wore a necklace with a goldfish pendant around his neck.</t1773> <t1774>When the captain used his boot to turn the man's face up for a clearer look, he was startled and exclaimed, "Holy crap," he said.</t1774> <t1775>Several other officers also rushed over.</t1775>
<t1776>- Look, where does this man come from? - the captain said to them.</t1776> <t1777>- That is Gregorio Stevenson.</t1777>
<t1778>At dawn, Accadio was shot in front of the cemetery wall after the military council held an emergency meeting.</t1778> <t1779>In the last two hours of his life, he still couldn't understand why the fear of death that had tormented him since childhood had vanished.</t1779> <t1780>With a cold, calm demeanor, not at all concerned with proving his newly found courage, he listened to the lengthy accusations.</t1780>
<t1781>He thought of Úrsula, who at this hour was probably drinking coffee with José Arcadio Buendía under the chestnut tree.</t1781> <t1782>He thought of the eight-month-old daughter who still had no name and the child that would be born in the coming August. He thought of Santa Sofía de la Piedad, who had marinated a deer last night for Saturday's lunch, remembered her long hair falling over her shoulders, and her long eyelashes that looked like they were fake.</t1782> <t1783>He thought of his people without the slightest regret.</t1783> <t1784>In the fairness that life demanded, he began to understand how much he actually loved those he had once hated.</t1784> <t1785>The president of the military council began his final speech just as Arcadio suddenly remembered that two hours had already passed.</t1785> <t1786>"Although the positions assigned to him were insignificant," the president said, "his aggressive, irresponsible, and cruel attitude led his subordinates to useless deaths, which is enough to sentence him to death."... At the cracked school where he first felt the certainty of power, just a few meters from the classroom where he first experienced bewildering love, Arcadio encountered the ridiculous form of death.</t1786> <t1787>In reality, what mattered to him now was not death but life, and thus, the feeling he experienced when sentenced to death was not fear but longing.</t1787> <t1788>He remained silent until asked what his final wish was.</t1788>
<t1789>- Tell my wife, - he replied in a loud voice, - to name our daughter Ucsula, - he thought and confirmed: yes, Ucsula, the name of her grandmother.</t1789> <t1790>And tell my wife that if the child to be born is a boy, name him José Arcadio, but not after his uncle, rather after his grandfather.</t1790>
<t1791>Before they took him to the wall at the cemetery, Father Nicanor intended to baptize him. "I have no regrets," Arcadio said, and followed the execution squad's orders after drinking a cup of black coffee.</t1791> <t1792>The commander of the execution squad, a man who specialized in carrying out death sentences, had a name very fitting for his profession: Captain Roque Carnicero. On the way to the cemetery, under a light drizzle, Arcadio noticed that a dawn Wednesday was beginning to glow on the horizon.</t1792> <t1793>Nostalgia dissolved in the mist and left behind a terrible curiosity.</t1793>
<t1794>Only when he was ordered to lean against the wall did Arcadio see Rebeca with her wet hair, wearing a pink floral dress, opening the door of the house wide.</t1794> <t1795>He silently prayed that Rebeca would recognize him.</t1795> <t1796>Indeed, at that moment, Rebeca looked towards the cemetery wall and suddenly stood there, stunned and horrified.</t1796> <t1797>She barely had time to signal a farewell to Arcadio.</t1797> <t1798>Arcadio responded with a similar gesture.</t1798> <t1799>At that moment, the smoking barrels of the guns fired at Arcadio, and he clearly heard each word of the chant recited by old Melquíades and felt the staggering footsteps of Santa Sofía de la Piedad, the virgin maiden, echoing in the classroom, and felt the cold hardness of ice on his nose, which he had noticed in the nostrils of Remedios' corpse.</t1799> <t1800>"Ah, the b... - he just had time to think, - I forgot to say that if it's a girl, name her Remedios."</t1800> <t1801>At that moment, he felt the fear that had tormented him his entire life.</t1801> <t1802>The captain ordered the guns to fire.</t1802> <t1803>Almost at the same time, Arcadio managed to puff out his chest and lift his head, not understanding where the stream of hot, thick liquid that was burning his muscles was coming from:</t1803>
<t1804>- You old goat, - he shouted - Long live the Liberal Party!</t1804>
<t1805>Chapter 7</t1805>
<t1806>The war ended in May.</t1806> <t1807>Two weeks before the government issued an official announcement, in a boastful statement, they promised to mercilessly punish the leaders of the uprising.</t1807> <t1808>It was at that moment that Colonel Aureliano Buendía was captured while disguised as an Indian shaman, just as he was about to cross the western border of the country.</t1808> <t1809>Of the twenty-one men who followed him in the war, fourteen died in battle, six were wounded, and only one remained with him in the final defeat.</t1809> <t1810>That person was Colonel Gerineldo Márquez.</t1810> <t1811>Through a special decree, the news of his capture was announced in the village of Macondo.</t1811>
<t1812>"He is still alive… - Úrsula informed her husband.</t1812> <t1813>"Let us hope that his enemies have mercy."</t1813> <t1814>After three days of crying, one afternoon while stirring a pot of milk candy over the fire, she clearly heard her son's voice right next to her ear.</t1814> <t1815>"It's Aureliano," she screamed as she ran to the chestnut tree to inform her husband: "I don't know what kind of omen this is, but he is alive and we will see him soon."</t1815> <t1816>She believed that omen to be true.</t1816> <t1817>She ordered the floor to be cleaned and the furniture to be rearranged.</t1817> <t1818>A week later, a source without origin, not based on any decree, heartbreakingly confirmed that omen.</t1818> <t1819>Colonel Aureliano Buendía was sentenced to death, and the sentence would be carried out in the village of Macondo to intimidate the populace.</t1819> <t1820>At seven twenty on a Monday morning, Amaranta was dressing Aureliano José when she heard a distant commotion and a chilling cornet blast, and a minute later Úrsula burst into the room.</t1820> <t1821>"They are bringing him back," she said.</t1821> <t1822>The soldiers had to struggle, using their rifle butts to push through the chaotic crowd.</t1822> <t1823>Úrsula and Amaranta ran to the end of the street, pushed through the crowd, and there they saw Aureliano Buendía.</t1823> <t1824>He looked like a beggar: his clothes were in tatters, his hair and beard were unkempt, he was barefoot, his hands were tied behind his back with a rope attached to the saddle of the officer's horse.</t1824> <t1825>Along with him, the soldiers were also escorting Colonel Gerineldo Márquez, who was just as ragged and miserable as he was.</t1825> <t1826>The two men were not sad at all.</t1826> <t1827>They seemed to be excited in front of the crowd that was shouting and cursing the most depraved soldiers.</t1827>
<t1828>- Oh my child! - in the noisy scene filled with screams, Ursula called out to her child and slapped the soldier who was trying to stop her.</t1828>
<t1829>The officer's horse jumped up.</t1829> <t1830>At this moment, Colonel Aureliano Buendía stopped, trembling, and avoided his mother's outstretched arms that were about to embrace him, giving her a stern look:</t1830>
<t1831>- Mother, please go home, - he said.</t1831> <t1832>- Please ask the authorities for permission to visit me in prison.</t1832>
<t1833>He looked at Amaranta standing two steps behind Ucsula, smiled at her, and asked, "What happened to your hand?".</t1833> <t1834>Amaranta raised her bandaged hand. "Burned," she replied and pulled Ucsula back to avoid being trampled by the horse.</t1834> <t1835>The soldiers fired their guns into the air.</t1835> <t1836>The special guard unit surrounded the two prisoners and rode off, dragging them back to the military camp.</t1836>
<t1837>That afternoon, Úrsula went to the prison to visit Colonel Aureliano Buendía.</t1837> <t1838>She had intended to go through Don Apolinar Moscote to get permission to visit, but he had been stripped of all his power by the dictatorial soldiers.</t1838> <t1839>Father Nicanor was being laid low by a liver fever.</t1839> <t1840>The parents of Colonel Gerineldo Márquez, who had not been sentenced to death, tried to visit their son but were beaten with rifle butts by the soldiers and driven away.</t1840> <t1841>In the face of the hopelessness of finding intermediaries to help her, and moreover convincing herself that her son would be shot at dawn the next day, Úrsula wrapped up a bundle of supplies to bring to him, and went straight to the barracks by herself.</t1841>
<t1842>- I am the mother of Colonel Aureliano Buendía, - she introduced herself.</t1842>
<t1843>The guards stopped her. "Whatever you want, I'm going in," Ursula told them.</t1843> <t1844>"If you have orders to shoot, then go ahead and start all at once."</t1844> <t1845>She pushed one of the soldiers aside and stepped into the old classroom where a group of shirtless soldiers were busily cleaning their guns.</t1845> <t1846>An officer in field uniform, with rosy skin and glasses as thick as bottle bottoms, moving leisurely, ordered the guards to withdraw.</t1846>
<t1847>- I am the mother of Colonel Aureliano Buendía, - Úrsula repeated.</t1847>
<t1848>- You mean to say, - the officer, correcting her with a charming smile, - you are the mother who gave birth to Mr. Aureliano Buendía.</t1848>
<t1849>In the gentle speech of the officer, Úrsula recognized the soft intonation of the highland people, the dandies.</t1849>
<t1850>- Sir, just as you said.</t1850> <t1851>- She sincerely admits it.</t1851> <t1852>- Are you willing to let me visit it?</t1852>
<t1853>There was an order from the higher-ups not to allow anyone to visit the prisoners sentenced to death.</t1853><t1854>But this officer dared to take responsibility for letting her visit her son for fifteen minutes.</t1854><t1855>Ursula showed the officer the items she had in her package: a clean set of clothes to change into, the boots her son wore on his wedding day, and milk candies she had set aside from the day she received the omen.</t1855><t1856>She met Colonel Aureliano Buendía in the cell, lying on a single bed, with his arms spread wide because his armpits were swollen.</t1856><t1857>He had been allowed to shave.</t1857><t1858>His thick, curled mustache accentuated his high cheekbones even more.</t1858><t1859>It seemed to Ursula that her son looked paler than when he left, taller, and lonelier than ever.</t1859><t1860>He knew all the details of what had happened at home: Pietro Crespi's suicide, Arcadio's arrogance and execution, José Arcadio Buendía growing weaker under the chestnut tree.</t1860><t1861>He knew that Amaranta had decided to remain single for life to raise Aureliano José and that the child was very well-behaved, moreover intelligent, learning to read and write as soon as he learned to speak.</t1861><t1862>From the moment she stepped into the cell, Ursula felt overwhelmed by her son's maturity, his sense of command, and the aura of authority radiating from his skin.</t1862><t1863>She was surprised to see him know everything. "You already know, mother, I'm very good at guessing," he joked.</t1863><t1864>Then, with a serious demeanor, he added, "This morning, when they took me away, I had the feeling that all of this had already happened."</t1864>
<t1865>Indeed, while the people were angrily shouting around him, he concentrated his thoughts and was surprised at the village's aged appearance over the past year.</t1865> <t1866>The almond trees spread out their tattered leaves.</t1866> <t1867>The houses, once painted green, then red, and then green again, began to take on an indescribable color.</t1867>
<t1868>- What are you waiting for? - Ucsula sighed.</t1868> <t1869>- Time is passing by.</t1869>
<t1870>- That's right, - Aureliano admitted, - but not much, mother.</t1870>
<t1871>In this form, the long-awaited visit, for which both had prepared questions and anticipated answers, once again became an everyday conversation.</t1871> <t1872>When the guard announced that the permitted time for the conversation was over, Aureliano lifted the mat and took out a sweat-stained notebook.</t1872> <t1873>It contained his poems.</t1873> <t1874>Some were poems he had written when he loved Remedios and had taken with him when he left, and some were poems he had written during moments of rest after battles, filled with confusion.</t1874> <t1875>"Promise me you won't let anyone read them," he said, "burn them in the oven tonight."</t1875> <t1876>Úrsula promised him, then she prepared to bid him farewell with a kiss.</t1876>
<t1877>- Mom brought you a revolver, - she whispered.</t1877>
<t1878>Colonel Aureliano Buendía looked around and saw that the guard was not there.</t1878> <t1879>"It won't do you any good, mother," he whispered. "Alright, just leave it here, or else they'll search you when you leave."</t1879>
<t1880>Ursula took a pistol out from her chest pocket and he hid it under the mat.</t1880> <t1881>"Now there's no need for farewells," he calmly said.</t1881> <t1882>"Mother, you don't need to beg anyone and you don't need to lower yourself before anyone.</t1882> <t1883>Just consider that they have already shot me dead a long time ago."</t1883> <t1884>Ursula bit her lip to keep from crying out.</t1884>
<t1885>- Apply hot bricks to the swollen areas under your arms, - she said.</t1885>
<t1886>She turned halfway around and then left the cell.</t1886> <t1887>Colonel Aureliano Buendía stood still, looking pensive, until the door closed.</t1887> <t1888>Then he lay down on the bed, spreading his arms wide: Ever since he entered adolescence, when he began to perceive his own omens, he had thought that death must be heralded by a definitive, unmistakable sign, one that could not be altered, but with only a few hours left before he was to die, no such sign had come to him.</t1888>
<t1889>One day, a stunningly beautiful woman entered the Tucurinca barracks, asking the guards for permission to visit him.</t1889> <t1890>They allowed her to enter because they were accustomed to the fanaticism of some mothers who often sent their daughters to the bedrooms of the most famous warriors, as these men claimed, to improve the breed.</t1890> <t1891>That night, Colonel Aureliano Buendía had just finished writing a poem about a man lost in the rain when the girl entered the room.</t1891> <t1892>He turned his back to her to place the paper in a locked drawer where he kept his poems.</t1892> <t1893>And then he felt the presence of death.</t1893> <t1894>He grabbed the gun from the drawer without turning around.</t1894>
<t1895>- Please, don't shoot! - He said.</t1895>
<t1896>When he turned back, with a gun in hand ready to fire, the girl had already lowered her gun, flustered and unsure of what to do.</t1896><t1897>In this way, he had escaped four out of eleven ambushes.</t1897><t1898>On the contrary, there was one person who could never be caught, who infiltrated the revolutionary camp and stabbed Colonel Macgriffico Visban, his closest friend, to death while he was lying shivering on the bed waiting for the fever to break.</t1898><t1899>Just a few meters away, while sleeping on a hammock in the same room, he was unaware of anything.</t1899><t1900>His efforts to systematize the omens all became futile.</t1900><t1901>Suddenly, the omens all appeared at once in a brilliant flash of superior intelligence, but they were ungraspable because they were like an absolute but fleeting belief.</t1901><t1902>Sometimes they were so obvious that only after they had come true did he consider them as omens.</t1902><t1903>At other times, they appeared clearly but did not come true.</t1903><t1904>Usually, they were just sudden, crude punches of superstition.</t1904><t1905>But when he was sentenced to death and when he was asked to express his final wishes, he had no difficulty affirming the omen he recognized in his response:</t1905>
<t1906>- I request that the sentence be carried out in Macondo, - he said.</t1906>
<t1907>The judge was annoyed.</t1907>
<t1908>- Buendía, don't hope to escape death, - he said to him, - it's merely a tactic to buy time.</t1908>
<t1909>- It seems that you do not want to carry out this sentence in Macondo, - the colonel said - but that is my final wish.</t1909>
<t1910>Since then, he no longer received any omens.</t1910> <t1911>On the day Ursula visited him in prison, after much contemplation, he came to the conclusion: perhaps this time his death would not be foretold because it did not depend on fate but on the will of the executioners.</t1911> <t1912>That night, he stayed awake, writhing in pain with two festering, aching armpits.</t1912> <t1913>But just before dawn, he clearly heard footsteps in the hallway.</t1913>
<t1914>"They are coming," he said to himself, and suddenly he thought of José Arcadio Buendía, who at that moment, in the early dismal morning, was also sitting under the chestnut tree thinking of him.</t1914>
<t1915>Not feeling fear, nor longing, he only felt furious that this artificial death had not allowed him to see with his own eyes the final result of so much unfinished work.</t1915> <t1916>The door opened, and a guard stepped into the room to bring him a cup of coffee.</t1916> <t1917>The next day at this exact time, he still lived in that feeling, irritated because of the pain in his armpits, and everything happened exactly the same way.</t1917> <t1918>On the fifth day, he also shared the joy of eating milk candy with the guards, wore a clean outfit that was a bit tight for his body, and put on a pair of varnished boots.</t1918> <t1919>On the sixth day, they still hadn't shot him.</t1919>
<t1920>In reality, they did not dare to carry out the sentence.</t1920> <t1921>The people's defiance forced the military authorities to consider that executing Colonel Aureliano Buendía would have serious political repercussions not only in Macondo but throughout the entire swamp region, so they had to seek advice from the provincial authorities.</t1921> <t1922>On Saturday night, Captain Roque Carnicero and several officers went to Catarino's bar. Only one woman, almost compelled, dared to take him to her room.</t1922> <t1923>"None of the sisters dare to sleep with a man they know is going to die," the girl confessed to him.</t1923> <t1924>"No one knows how things will turn out, but the whole village says that the officer who shoots Colonel Aureliano Buendía, as well as all the soldiers in the firing squad, will sooner or later be killed one by one, even if they flee to the ends of the earth."</t1924> <t1925>Captain Roque Carnicero relayed this to several officers, who then reported it to their superiors.</t1925> <t1926>On Sunday, although no one could prove anything definitively, and although no military action could disrupt the heavy silence of those days, the entire village knew that the officers were trying every possible way to evade the duty of carrying out the sentence.</t1926> <t1927>On Monday, a telegram arrived with the official order: "The execution must be carried out within twenty-four hours of receiving this message."</t1927> <t1928>That night, the officers placed seven slips of paper with their names into a kepi, and the ill-fated Captain Roque Carnicero drew the slip of the one who had to carry out the sentence: "Bad luck cannot be avoided," he said with a bitter, silent resignation.</t1928> <t1929>"Born the son of a whore, I will die the son of a whore..."</t1929> <t1930>At five in the morning, by drawing lots, he formed the firing squad, gathered them in the camp courtyard, and woke the condemned man with a fateful phrase:</t1930>
<t1931>- Let's go, Buendía, - he urged him, - our time has come.</t1931>
<t1932>- Ah, so that's how it is, - the colonel said, - I was dreaming that I was being blown up by boils.</t1932>
<t1933>Rebeca Buendía, ever since she heard the news that Aureliano would be shot, frequently woke up at three in the morning.</t1933> <t1934>She sat silently in the dark room, watching the cemetery wall through the half-open window, while the bed she sat on shook with the rhythm of José Arcadio's snoring. For a whole week, she patiently waited as she had once waited for letters from Pietro Crespi.</t1934> <t1935>"They won't shoot him here," José Arcadio told her. "They will shoot him right in the prison at midnight so no one knows who is leading the firing squad, and then they will bury him right there."</t1935> <t1936>Nevertheless, Rebeca continued to wait.</t1936> <t1937>"They are so foolish that they will definitely shoot him here," she said.</t1937> <t1938>She believed in herself so much that she had already prepared how to open the door and how to wave farewell to him.</t1938> <t1939>"They won't take him along the main road," he kept insisting, "because they only have six cowardly soldiers while knowing full well that the townspeople are ready to do anything."</t1939> <t1940>Ignoring her husband's logic, she still sat by the window looking out at the cemetery wall.</t1940>
<t1941>- Then we will see that they are such fools, - she said.</t1941>
<t1942>At five o'clock in the morning on Tuesday, José Arcadio had finished his coffee and released the hunting dogs just as Rebeca closed the door and struggled to hold onto the bedpost to keep from falling. "They've taken him out already," she sighed.</t1942> <t1943>"Oh, how handsome he is."</t1943>
<t1944>José Arcadio stuck his head out the window, looking at the trembling young man in the dawn light, wearing clothes that had once been his own when he was young. The young man stood with his back against the wall, hands on his hips because his armpits were so swollen that he couldn't let his arms hang down.</t1944><t1945>"It's really ridiculous," Colonel Aureliano Buendía muttered.</t1945><t1946>"It's so ridiculous that it takes six sick men to kill one unarmed person."</t1946><t1947>He kept repeating it with such anger that it seemed he was boiling with rage, and Captain Roque Carnicero also felt pity because he thought the colonel was praying to God. When the firing squad aimed their guns at him, his anger materialized into a bitter mucus that settled on his tongue, lulling him to sleep and forcing him to close his eyes.</t1947><t1948>At that moment, the glorious dawn light vanished, and he saw himself as a little boy wearing short pants with a bow tied at his neck, and he saw himself in a radiant afternoon leading himself into the theater, and he saw the block of ice.</t1948><t1949>When he heard the shout, he immediately thought it was the final order for the firing squad.</t1949><t1950>He opened his eyes wide.</t1950><t1951>With a chilling curiosity, he awaited the bullets to pierce him but only saw Captain Roque Carnicero raising his hands, and saw José Arcadio crossing the street brandishing a shotgun ready to fire.</t1951>
<t1952>- Please don't shoot, - the captain said to José Arcadio - you have come by the command of the Almighty.</t1952>
<t1953>From that point, a new war began.</t1953> <t1954>Captain Roque Carnicero, along with six of his subordinates, followed Colonel Aureliano Buendía to liberate the revolutionaries, General Victorio Medina, who had been sentenced to death in Riohacha.</t1954> <t1955>They thought they could save time by quickly crossing the mountain range along the path José Arcadio Buendía had taken to establish the village of Macondo, but within less than a week, they unanimously agreed that it was an impassable route.</t1955> <t1956>Thus, they had to undertake a perilous journey along the mountain slopes with the scant ammunition of the soldiers in the execution squad.</t1956> <t1957>They rested on the outskirts of the villages.</t1957> <t1958>One of them, disguised and carrying a golden fish, entered the village in broad daylight to meet with the waiting Liberal faction members.</t1958>
<t1959>The next morning, these people went hunting and would never be seen returning.</t1959> <t1960>When they saw the city of Rioacha from a mountain bend, General Victorio Medina had already been executed.</t1960> <t1961>The men under Colonel Aureliano Buendía immediately proclaimed him Commander of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of the Caribbean coast with the rank of General.</t1961> <t1962>He accepted the position but refused the rank, setting for himself the condition that he would not accept the rank until his army had overthrown the Royalist regime.</t1962> <t1963>Exactly three months later, he had gathered more than a thousand troops but was defeated by government forces.</t1963>
<t1964>The survivors fled towards the eastern border of the country.</t1964> <t1965>Another time, it was known that they had landed at Cabo de la Vela from the Antidat archipelago, yet a government communiqué was sent through the postal service and reprinted in the form of cheerful notices spread throughout the country, announcing the death of Colonel Aureliano Buendía.</t1965> <t1966>But two days later, another troubling telegram, almost simultaneous with the previous one, reported a new uprising in the southern plains. Thus began the legend of Colonel Aureliano Buendía's uncanny abilities.</t1966> <t1967>Similar and different news spread, announcing his victory in Vidanuéva, his defeat in Goacamadan, that he had been killed by the Indians in Colombia and Venezuela, that he died in some village in the swamp region, and once again he rose up in Urumita.</t1967> <t1968>The leaders of the Liberal Party, meanwhile negotiating their participation in the parliament, considered him an adventurous rogue who did not represent the party.</t1968> <t1969>The national government classified him as a bandit and offered a reward of five thousand pesos for his capture.</t1969> <t1970>After sixteen failed armed uprisings, Colonel Aureliano Buendía, with two thousand Indian soldiers armed from the Goahira region, launched an attack, and the Royalist guard, caught by surprise while sleeping, had to abandon the city of Riohacha and flee.</t1970> <t1971>There, he established his General Headquarters and declared a total war against the regime.</t1971> <t1972>The first reaction from the government that he received was a threat to execute Colonel Gerineldo Márquez within forty-eight hours if he did not withdraw all his armed forces to the eastern border.</t1972> <t1973>Colonel Roque Carnicero, now his chief of staff, solemnly handed him the telegram.</t1973> <t1974>But he revealed his joy upon reading the telegram.</t1974>
<t1975>- Very good, - he exclaimed, - Macondo now has a telegraph station.</t1975>
<t1976>His answer was decisive.</t1976> <t1977>For three months, he waited to establish his General Headquarters in Macondo.</t1977> <t1978>If by then he had not seen Colonel Gerineldo Márquez alive, he would execute all the captured officers without trial, starting with the generals, and at the same time, he would order his subordinates to proceed in the same manner, executing Royalist officers until the war ended.</t1978> <t1979>Three months later, when he triumphantly marched into Macondo, the first embrace he received on the road from the swamp to the village was from Colonel Gerineldo Márquez.</t1979>
<t1980>The house was crowded with children.</t1980> <t1981>Ursula welcomed Santa Sofia de la Piedad along with her first daughter and the twin children born five months after Arcadio's execution into her home.</t1981>
<t1982>Contrary to the final wishes of the condemned man, she named his first daughter Remedios.</t1982> <t1983>"I believe that is what Arcadio wanted to say," she said.</t1983> <t1984>"We will not call her Ursula because with that name she would suffer her whole life."</t1984>
<t1985>There were two twin children left, one named Arcadio Segundo and the other Aureliano Segundo.</t1985> <t1986>Amaranta took on the responsibility of looking after all these children.</t1986> <t1987>She arranged small chairs in the living room and accepted some neighborhood children to form a beginner's class.</t1987> <t1988>When Colonel Aureliano Buendía returned to the village, amidst the booming sound of fireworks and the resounding church bells, a children's choir came to his house to welcome him with songs.</t1988> <t1989>Aureliano José, tall like his grandfather, wearing a revolutionary officer's uniform, saluted him with a military gesture.</t1989>
<t1990>During the conversation, joyful stories were mixed with sad ones.</t1990><t1991>A year after Colonel Aureliano escaped, José Arcadio and Rebeca moved into the house that Arcadio had built.</t1991><t1992>No one knew that he had disrupted the execution.</t1992><t1993>The couple built a warm and welcoming home in their new house, situated in the most beautiful corner of the main square, nestled under the shade of an ancient almond tree with three redbird nests.</t1993><t1994>The house had a main entrance for guests and four windows to let in light.</t1994><t1995>Rebeca's friends, including the four Moscote sisters who were still unmarried, resumed their gatherings to embroider, a tradition that had never been interrupted in the past years, in the corridor adorned with begonia pots.</t1995><t1996>José Arcadio continued to enjoy the benefits of the lands he had seized, with deeds recognized by the Royalist government.</t1996><t1997>Every afternoon, he was seen returning on horseback, a double-barreled shotgun slung over his shoulder, followed by fierce hunting dogs, with a string of wild rabbits hanging from his saddle.</t1997><t1998>One September afternoon, before a threatening storm, he returned home earlier than usual.</t1998><t1999>He greeted Rebeca, who was in the dining room, tied the dogs in the yard, hung the string of rabbits in the kitchen to be cleaned and marinated later, and then went to the bedroom to change clothes.</t1999><t2000>Later, Rebeca explained that when her husband entered the bedroom, she was in the bathroom and knew nothing of what happened.</t2000><t2001>It was a hard-to-believe explanation, but no clearer one was available, and no one could think of any other reason for Rebeca to kill the man who had brought her happiness.</t2001><t2002>That might be the only mystery that was never solved in the village of Macondo.</t2002>
<t2003>Just as José Arcadio closed the door to his room, a gunshot rang out, shaking the entire house.</t2003> <t2004>A stream of blood flowed out from under the door, crawled across the living room, went out onto the street, continued to flow along the rugged roads, climbed over steps and obstacles, crawled steadily along the Turkish road, turned left onto one street then right onto another before making a carpenter's square turn right in front of the Buendía house, slipped under the closed door into the house, clung to the wall to avoid staining the carpets, continued to crawl through another room, made a wide loop to avoid the dining table, crawled along the hallway past the sugar-recovery pots and slipped under the chair where Amaranta was teaching arithmetic to Aureliano José without being seen, then disappeared as it entered the corn storage, and reappeared in the kitchen where Úrsula was cracking thirty-six eggs to make a cake.</t2004>
<t2005>- Oh, Virgin Mary, - Ursula screamed loudly.</t2005>
<t2006>The blood flowed backward, and to find its source, she crawled through the corn shed, followed the corridor lined with begonias where little Aureliano José was loudly reciting three times three is nine, passed through the dining rooms and two living rooms, then went straight out to the main road, turned left and right to enter Turkey Street, not remembering that she was still wearing the apron she used in the kitchen and the two house slippers, then she went out to the square, entered a house she had never been in before, pushed open the bedroom door, and was almost overwhelmed by the smell of gunpowder, and she found José Arcadio lying face down on the floor, his body covering the boots he had just taken off, and saw the blood trickling from his right ear.</t2006><t2007>There was no visible wound on his body, nor could the gun that had fired be found.</t2007><t2008>Nor could the acrid smell of gunpowder be washed off the corpse.</t2008><t2009>First, they bathed him with soap and scrubbing pads, then soaked him in vinegar and salt water, then used ash and lemon juice, and finally placed him in a tub of bleach for six hours straight.</t2009><t2010>They scrubbed him so much that his tattoos began to fade.</t2010><t2011>When they resorted to embalming him with pepper, dill, bay leaves, and simmering the corpse over a low flame for a whole day, the body began to fall apart, forcing them to bury him immediately.</t2011><t2012>They laid the corpse in an oversized coffin, two and a half meters long and one meter wide, lined with tin inside and tightly sealed with steel screws.</t2012><t2013>Despite the thorough washing and embalming, the corpse still emitted a burnt smell along the way as the funeral procession passed.</t2013>
<t2014>Cha Nicanô, with his round, liver-pained belly like a drum, stood on the bed sprinkling holy water on him.</t2014> <t2015>Although in recent months people had built graves with concrete slabs placed on top and scattered ashes, sawdust, and lime powder, the cemetery continued to reek of gunpowder, so much so that in later years, engineers from the Banana Company had to pour a concrete cover over the grave.</t2015> <t2016>Immediately after the coffin was taken away, Rêbêca shut the door and buried herself alive in the house, wearing a wrinkled coarse cloth outfit that no worldly desire could tear.</t2016> <t2017>During the period of the appearance of the demon Juđiô Erăngtê, Macônđô experienced a terrible heatwave that caused birds to crash through the wire mesh and die in the bedrooms; she went out once, very old, wearing old silver-white boots and a hat adorned with tiny flowers.</t2017> <t2018>The last time anyone saw her alive was when she shot dead a thief trying to break into her house.</t2018> <t2019>Since then, no one except Arhêmđa, her servant and confidante, had direct contact with her.</t2019> <t2020>There was a time when it was known that she wrote letters to the Bishop, whom she called her cousin, but it was also rumored that she never received a reply.</t2020> <t2021>The villagers had forgotten her.</t2021>
<t2022>Although returning victorious, Colonel Aureliano Buendía was not satisfied with the visible results.</t2022> <t2023>The government troops withdrew from the towns without any resistance, which sowed an illusion of an irreversible victory among the newly liberated populace.</t2023> <t2024>But the revolutionaries, especially Colonel Aureliano Buendía, understood the truth more accurately.</t2024> <t2025>Despite maintaining five thousand men under his command at that time and holding two coastal provinces, he was acutely aware that his forces were being pushed towards the sea and were in such a politically complicated situation that when he ordered the reconstruction of the church bell tower, which had been destroyed by artillery, Father Nicanor, lying on his sickbed, exclaimed: "This is a joke: the defenders of the Christian faith have shelled the church, while the Freemasons are ordering its reconstruction."</t2025> <t2026>For hours and hours, he stayed in the telegraph room, talking with the commanders of other towns, seeking a way out.</t2026>
<t2027>But every time he left the room, he increasingly confirmed his feeling that the war was coming to an end.</t2027> <t2028>When the new victory news of the Freedom fighters was delivered and loudly announced, he calculated the results achieved on the maps and understood that his army was retreating deeper into the forest to fight tuberculosis and jungle mosquitoes, moving further away from the city. "We are wasting time," he lamented to the officers.</t2028> <t2029>"We will continue to waste time while those bastards in the Freedom party are begging for a seat in parliament."</t2029> <t2030>In sleepless nights lying on the hammock hung in the very room that used to be a death row cell, he recalled the images of lawyers dressed in black with collars turned up to cover their ears and sleeves hanging down to cover their hands, stepping out of the President's mansion in the freezing cold of the night towards dawn, shivering, quickly slipping into the mournful coffee gardens at dawn to ponder over what the President meant when he said yes, or perhaps what he meant when he said no, and to search for what the President was thinking when he said something entirely different.</t2030> <t2031>Meanwhile, he swatted mosquitoes, endured the sweltering heat of thirty-five degrees, and felt increasingly closer to the dreadful morning when he would have to order his soldiers to plunge into the sea.</t2031>
<t2032>One restless night, Pila Tecnêra sang with the soldiers in the courtyard.</t2032> <t2033>He asked her to predict his future through the cards.</t2033> <t2034>"Keep your mouth shut," that was all Pila Tecnêra clearly saw after arranging the cards and gathering them back.</t2034>
<t2035>"I don't know what that means, but the omen is very clear: keep your mouth shut"… Two days later, someone replaced him and ordered an orderly to prepare a cup of coffee without sugar, then this orderly passed the order to another person, who then passed it to another until the cup of coffee without sugar, having gone through many hands, was brought to Colonel Aureliano Buendía's residence.</t2035> <t2036>Although he hadn't called for coffee, since it was already there, the colonel drank it.</t2036> <t2037>That cup of coffee contained enough strychnine to kill a stallion.</t2037> <t2038>When they brought him home, he was stiff, convulsed, with his tongue sticking out between his teeth.</t2038> <t2039>Úrsula fought with death to save him.</t2039> <t2040>After making him vomit to cleanse his stomach, she covered him with heated bed sheets and gave him egg whites to drink for two days until his weak body regained its normal temperature.</t2040> <t2041>On the fourth day, he was out of danger.</t2041> <t2042>Contrary to his wishes, due to Úrsula and his officers' insistence, he stayed in bed for another week.</t2042> <t2043>Only then did he learn that his poems had not been burned.</t2043> <t2044>"That night, mother didn't want to rush," Úrsula explained to him.</t2044> <t2045>"That night, when I went to light the stove, I thought it best to wait until your corpse was brought home."</t2045>
<t2046>Living among Remedios' dolls surrounding him, in the condition of gradually recovering health, Colonel Aureliano Buendía, through his poems, reminisced about the most vibrant periods of his life.</t2046> <t2047>He began writing poetry again. For many hours, on the sidelines of the prominent events of a war with no future, he affirmed his experiences right at the brink of death.</t2047> <t2048>Thus, his mind became increasingly clearer to the point where he could turn it inside out to examine it.</t2048> <t2049>One night, he asked Colonel Gerineldo Márquez:</t2049>
<t2050>- Tell me, why do you fight, my friend?</t2050>
<t2051>- Why are you asking me that, - Colonel Hêrinênđô Mackêt replied.</t2051> <t2052>- Because of the great Liberal party.</t2052>
<t2053>- I'm really happy because I know my goal in fighting, - he replied.</t2053> <t2054>- As for myself, until now I have only known that I fight for pride.</t2054>
<t2055>- That's terrible, - Colonel Hêrinênđô Mackêt replied.</t2055>
<t2056>The warning from Hernando Márquez delighted Colonel Aureliano Buendía.</t2056> <t2057>"Of course," he said.</t2057> <t2058>"But in any case, it's better not to know why you're fighting." He looked into his friend's eyes, smiled, and clarified:</t2058>
<t2059>- Or as if you had fought for something that meant nothing to anyone.</t2059>
<t2060>It was precisely that pride that prevented him from contacting the armed groups in the interior, while the leaders of the Liberal Party did not publicly make statements to dispel the notion that he was a bandit leader.</t2060> <t2061>However, he knew that if he could overcome those obstacles, he would immediately break the dangerous siege of war.</t2061> <t2062>His recovered health allowed him to think.</t2062> <t2063>So he asked Ursula not only for the remaining gold but also for the considerable capital she had accumulated. He appointed Colonel Gerineldo Márquez as the Governor in charge of military and civil matters in Macondo, and then he set out to establish relations with the insurgent groups in the interior.</t2063>
<t2064>Colonel Herinendo Marquez was not only Colonel Aureliano Buendía's closest confidant but also someone Ursula considered part of the family.</t2064> <t2065>Though he was elegant, shy, and well-mannered, he was more suited for battle than for leadership.</t2065> <t2066>His political advisors easily led him into theoretical mazes.</t2066> <t2067>However, he managed to establish a peaceful, rustic atmosphere in Macondo, which was what Colonel Aureliano Buendía dreamed of for his old age, living by making goldfish.</t2067> <t2068>Although he lived with his parents, he had lunch at Ursula's house two or three times a week.</t2068> <t2069>He taught Aureliano José how to use weapons, imparted basic military knowledge, and with Ursula's consent, took him to live in the barracks to train him.</t2069> <t2070>Many years ago, when he was still a child, Herinendo Marquez once expressed his feelings to Amaranta.</t2070> <t2071>At that time, Amaranta was secretly in love with Pietro Crespi, so she mocked him.</t2071> <t2072>Herinendo Marquez waited patiently.</t2072> <t2073>Once, from prison, he sent Amaranta a letter asking her to embroider the initials of his father's name on a dozen handkerchiefs.</t2073> <t2074>He also sent her money.</t2074> <t2075>Within a week, Amaranta brought him a dozen embroidered handkerchiefs along with the money, and she stayed for several hours to talk about the past. "When I get out of here, I will marry you," Herinendo Marquez said as he bid her farewell.</t2075> <t2076>Amaranta laughed but still thought of him while "teaching the children to read and trying to revive in her heart the passionate love of her youth, which had been her obsession with Pietro Crespi, to dedicate it to him.</t2076> <t2077>On Saturdays, visiting days, she would go to Herinendo Marquez's parents' house and then accompany them to the prison.</t2077> <t2078>One Saturday, Ursula was surprised to find her in the kitchen waiting for the biscuits to come out of the oven so she could choose the best ones to put in a pre-embroidered bag for the occasion.</t2078>
<t2079>- Take him, my dear! - she said to her. - It's very rare to find a man like him.</t2079>
<t2080>Amaranta pretended to be annoyed:</t2080>
<t2081>- I don't need to entice anyone - she argued with her mother. - I brought these cookies to Herinendo simply because I care about him and sooner or later, he will be shot dead.</t2081>
<t2082>Without any hesitation, she blurted it out.</t2082><t2083>But at that time, the government openly threatened to shoot Colonel Gerineldo Márquez if the insurgent forces did not surrender Riohacha.</t2083><t2084>Visits to the prisoner were suspended.</t2084><t2085>Amaranta shut herself in, crying and tormenting herself with the thought that she was guilty, just as she had been tormented when Remedios died, and just as another time, her careless words had been responsible for another death, the death of Pietro Crespi.</t2085><t2086>Úrsula comforted her.</t2086><t2087>She assured her that Colonel Aureliano Buendía would take strong practical action to prevent the execution, and she promised that she herself would welcome Gerineldo Márquez home when the war ended.</t2087><t2088>She fulfilled her promise ahead of schedule.</t2088><t2089>When Gerineldo Márquez arrived at the house with the responsibility of overseeing military and civil matters as the Provincial Governor, she welcomed him like a son, pampered him to stay, and from the bottom of her heart, she implored him to remember his intention to marry Amaranta.</t2089><t2090>Her pleas seemed to be effective.</t2090><t2091>On the days he came to the house for lunch, Colonel Gerineldo Márquez stayed the entire afternoon to play checkers with Amaranta on the veranda adorned with begonia pots.</t2091><t2092>Úrsula brought the young couple coffee with milk and biscuits, and kept an eye on the children to prevent them from disturbing the two.</t2092><t2093>In reality, Amaranta tried to rekindle the passionate love of her youth, which now felt like a forgotten heap of cold ashes in her heart.</t2093><t2094>With a longing that had reached an unchangeable intensity, she awaited the days he would come to her house for lunch, the afternoons of playing checkers, and the passing of time while she sat beside a warrior whose name evoked so many memories, and whose fingers trembled as he moved the pieces.</t2094><t2095>But on the day Colonel Gerineldo Márquez reiterated his heartfelt desire to marry Amaranta, she refused:</t2095>
<t2096>- I won't marry anyone, - she said, - and I won't marry you either.</t2096> <t2097>You love Aureliano so much that you will marry me because you can't marry him.</t2097>
<t2098>Colonel Aureliano Buendía was a calm person.</t2098> <t2099>"You will wait patiently," he said.</t2099> <t2100>"Sooner or later, you will marry me."</t2100>
<t2101>He continued to visit the house.</t2101> <t2102>Locking herself in the bedroom to cry in secret, Amaranta covered her ears with her fingertips to avoid hearing the suitor telling Úrsula the latest war news, and although she longed to see him to the point of death, she had enough strength not to go out and meet him.</t2102>
<t2103>At that time, Colonel Aureliano Buendía had arranged to send a detailed report about Macondo every two weeks.</t2103> <t2104>But only once, after nearly eight months away, did he write a private letter to Úrsula.</t2104> <t2105>A special messenger brought to the house a letter written in the colonel's beautiful handwriting: "Take good care of father because he is going to die."</t2105> <t2106>Úrsula was startled.</t2106> <t2107>"If Aureliano says so, then Aureliano knows," Úrsula said, and asked someone to carry José Arcadio Buendía into the bedroom.</t2107> <t2108>He was not only as heavy as he had been before but had grown even heavier during the time he lay under the chestnut tree, to the point that seven strong men could not lift him, forcing them to drag him into the house.</t2108> <t2109>The smell of fresh moss mixed with the scent of wood ear mushrooms, the odor of long-standing and dense humidity, filled the room when the robust old man, who had weathered rain and sun for a long time, began to breathe. The next day, he did not wake up in the bed placed in the room.</t2109> <t2110>After searching all the rooms, Úrsula once again found him lying under the chestnut tree.</t2110> <t2111>So they tied him to the bed.</t2111> <t2112>Though strong, José Arcadio Buendía had been rendered out of action... He accepted everything, no longer distinguishing anything.</t2112> <t2113>If he returned to lie under the chestnut tree, it was not out of desire but out of habit.</t2113> <t2114>Úrsula took care of him, fed him, and told him news about Aureliano. But in reality, the only person he had been in contact with for a long time was Prudencio Aguilar.</t2114>
<t2115>With a haggard appearance due to old age in the underworld, Prudencio Aguilar would come to the house twice a day to talk with him.</t2115> <t2116>The two of them talked about fighting cocks.</t2116> <t2117>They promised each other to build a coop for magnificent fighting cocks, not just for the joy of winning some matches but also to pass the time on the melancholic Sunday afternoons in the underworld.</t2117> <t2118>Prudencio Aguilar was the one who bathed him, fed him, and told him about the glorious victories of a completely unknown man called Aureliano, who was a colonel in battle.</t2118> <t2119>When alone, José Arcadio Buendía found some solace in dreams within the infinite room.</t2119> <t2120>He dreamed of getting up from bed, opening the main door, and walking into the next room, which had a bed with a steel headboard, a wicker rocking chair, and a portrait of the Virgin of Remedies hanging on the far wall.</t2120> <t2121>From this room, he would go into another identical room, whose door opened into yet another identical room, and so on endlessly.</t2121> <t2122>He enjoyed walking from room to room, as if walking in a corridor with mirrored walls on both sides, until Prudencio Aguilar patted him on the shoulder.</t2122> <t2123>Then he would return, passing through the rooms one by one, gradually waking up as he retraced his steps, only to meet Prudencio Aguilar again in the backdrop of reality.</t2123> <t2124>But then one night, two weeks after Úrsula had brought him into the house, Prudencio Aguilar patted him on the shoulder right in the intermediate room between reality and dreams, and he stayed there forever, thinking it was the room of reality.</t2124> <t2125>The very next morning, when bringing him breakfast, Úrsula encountered a man walking towards her from the hallway.</t2125> <t2126>The man was short and stout, dressed in black clothes, wearing a wide-brimmed black hat that almost covered his sad eyes. "Oh my God," Úrsula thought.</t2126> <t2127>"He looks like Melquiades...</t2127> <t2128>The man was Cataure, the brother of Visitación, who had left home to avoid the insomnia plague and had not been heard from since.</t2128> <t2129>When Visitación asked her brother why he had returned, he replied in their native language:</t2129>
<t2130>- I came to attend the emperor's funeral.</t2130>
<t2131>So everyone rushed into José Arcadio Buendía's room, using all their strength to shake him, shouting loudly to wake him, holding a mirror to his nostrils to check, but they couldn't wake him up.</t2131> <t2132>Shortly after, when the carpenter measured him to make the coffin, through the window, people saw a shower of tiny yellow flowers falling from the sky.</t2132> <t2133>All that night, the tiny yellow flowers fell on a village in silent sorrow.</t2133> <t2134>The flowers covered the rooftops and blocked the doorways.</t2134> <t2135>The sky was filled with the scent of flowers, causing the animals sleeping outside to suffocate. The flowers fell in such an uncountable number that by morning the streets were covered with a smooth blanket of flowers.</t2135> <t2136>People had to use sticks and poles to clear the flowers to make way for the funeral procession.</t2136>
<t2137>Chapter 8</t2137>
<t2138>Sitting on the wicker willow swing chair, with embroidery in her lap, Amaranta watched Aureliano José shave for the first time in his life.</t2138> <t2139>He was gliding the razor over his foam-covered chin.</t2139> <t2140>The razor blade cut the pimples, nicked his upper lip as he tried to trim his reddish mustache, but despite his efforts, it remained the same as before.</t2140> <t2141>His meticulous shaving made Amaranta feel as if he had begun to age at that moment.</t2141>
<t2142>- Your name is just like Aureliano's when he was your age - she said.</t2142> <t2143>- You are already a grown-up.</t2143>
<t2144>You've been an adult for a long time, ever since the day Amaranta thought you were still a child and continued to bathe naked in front of you, just as she had done ever since Pila Tecnêra returned you to the family, shedding her responsibility to raise you.</t2144><t2145>The first time you saw her bathing, you only noticed the deep groove between the two nipples on her chest.</t2145><t2146>At that time, you were so innocent that you had to ask her what was wrong with her chest, and Amaranta pretended to scratch her chest with her finger and replied to you, "I was carved, carved by someone."</t2146><t2147>Later, after recovering from the illness caused by Piêtrô Crêspi's suicide, she bathed together with Aurêlianô Hôsê in the bathroom again.</t2147><t2148>You no longer noticed the deep groove but instead shivered with strange delight at the sight of her pink, plump breasts.</t2148><t2149>You continued to watch her and thus understood more deeply the strange intimacy between the two of you, feeling goosebumps on your skin as you watched her, just as her skin would get goosebumps when she poured water over herself.</t2149><t2150>From a very young age, you had the habit of leaving your hammock empty all night to wake up on Amaranta's bed, because lying next to her, you were less afraid of the dark.</t2150><t2151>But ever since you became aware of the pleasure of her ivory body, the motivation for leaving your hammock to crawl into her mosquito net was not the fear of the dark but the desire to feel Amaranta's warm breath at dawn.</t2151><t2152>During the period when she was rejecting Colonel Hêrinênđô Mackêt, one early morning, Aurêlianô Hôsê woke up feeling suffocated.</t2152><t2153>You felt Amaranta's fingers, like silkworms, hot and eager, searching your belly.</t2153><t2154>Pretending to still be asleep, you shifted your position so they wouldn't encounter any obstacles on their path, and at that moment you realized that the five fingers of the hand without the black band, like blind snails, were groping between your thighs.</t2154><t2155>Although both of you pretended not to know what you both knew and what each knew the other knew, from that night on, you were bound together in a wonderful understanding.</t2155><t2156>Aurêlianô Hôsê couldn't sleep until he heard the waltz music from the clock in the living room, and the aging woman, whose skin began to feel numb, wouldn't be at peace until she felt the sleepwalker crawl into her mosquito net.</t2156><t2157>She had raised him without thinking that he would become a temporary anchor for her loneliness.</t2157><t2158>So they not only slept in the same bed, naked, craving each other's touch, but also followed each other around the house, staying in closed rooms at any time, always eagerly and never bored.</t2158><t2159>Once, they were almost caught by Ucsula.</t2159><t2160>One afternoon, she entered the cornmeal storeroom just as they were about to kiss.</t2160><t2161>"You love your aunt very much, don't you?" she asked Aurêlianô Hôsê with utmost innocence. He replied, "Yes," to his grandmother.</t2161><t2162>"Good boy," Ucsula concluded, measuring out flour to make bread before returning to the kitchen.</t2162><t2163>This incident pulled Amaranta out of her frenzy.</t2163><t2164>She realized that she had gone too far, that she was no longer kissing him as a child in play, but was instead wading through a dangerous, unhealthy passion with no way out, and she resolutely decided to extinguish this passion.</t2164><t2165>At the same time, Aurêlianô Hôsê, having finished his military training, realized the truth and left home to sleep in the barracks.</t2165><t2166>Every Saturday, he would go with the soldiers to Catarinô's shop. He found solace with the painted women, always imagining they were Amaranta.</t2166>
<t2167>Shortly thereafter, contradictory war news began to be circulated.</t2167> <t2168>While the government acknowledged the new advances of the insurgent forces, the officers in Macondo received reliable notifications about an inevitable truce negotiated by both sides.</t2168> <t2169>At the beginning of April, a trusted messenger came to meet with Colonel Gerineldo Márquez.</t2169> <t2170>This person assured the colonel that the party leaders had made contact with the insurgent commanders in the interior and were ready to sign a truce agreement on the condition that the government would grant the Liberal faction three ministerial seats, a minimum number of representatives in parliament, and general amnesty for the insurgents who had laid down their arms.</t2170> <t2171>The messenger carried a highly confidential order from Colonel Aureliano Buendía, who did not approve of the terms of the agreement.</t2171>
<t2172>Colonel Herinendo Marquez had to choose the five best men and prepare to flee abroad.</t2172> <t2173>This order was carried out in the shortest possible time.</t2173> <t2174>A week before the agreement was announced, amidst the chaos of various rumors, Colonel Aureliano Buendía and his ten most trusted officers, including Colonel Roque Carnicero, quietly returned to Macondo at midnight, disbanded the army, buried the weapons, and discarded the documents.</t2174> <t2175>At dawn, along with Colonel Herinendo Marquez and his five subordinates, they left the village.</t2175> <t2176>It was a campaign carried out so quickly and secretly that Úrsula knew nothing until the last moment when someone lightly tapped on her bedroom window and whispered: "If you want to see Colonel Aureliano Buendía, please come to the door immediately."</t2176> <t2177>Úrsula sprang up, still in her nightclothes, stepped to the door, and barely managed to recognize the sound of the horses' hooves as the group quietly rode out of the village, leaving a cloud of dust behind.</t2177> <t2178>It wasn't until the next day that she learned Aureliano José had gone with his father.</t2178>
<t2179>Ten days after a joint communiqué between the government and the opposition was announced, signaling a ceasefire, there were reports of the first armed uprising by Colonel Aureliano Buendía on the eastern border.</t2179> <t2180>His forces, not only few in number but also poorly equipped, were crushed in less than a week.</t2180> <t2181>But throughout that year, while the Liberals and the Conservatives tried to keep the country in reconciliation, he planned seven uprisings.</t2181> <t2182>One night, from a ship, he shelled the city of Riohacha, and the patrol had to wake up in the middle of the night, retaliating by shooting fourteen prominent Liberals imprisoned in the city.</t2182> <t2183>He occupied a customs house on the border for more than fifteen days, and from there he sent a call for a general uprising to the nation.</t2183> <t2184>One of his battalions got lost in the jungle for three months, as this unit had the mission to traverse more than fifteen hundred kilometers of forest to ignite battles around the capital.</t2184> <t2185>At times, he was only a few dozen kilometers from Macondo, but government patrols forced him to retreat deep into the mountains, not far from the intriguing spot where, many years earlier, his father had found the remains of a Spanish galleon.</t2185>
<t2186>During this time, Visitacion also passed away.</t2186> <t2187>After giving up the throne due to fear of the insomnia epidemic, she wished to die of old age, and her final wish was for people to dig up the savings she had accumulated over several decades buried under her bed and send it to Colonel Aureliano Buendía so he could continue fighting.</t2187> <t2188>But Úrsula did not allow the money to be dug up, because at that time there were rumors that Colonel Aureliano Buendía had died in a landing operation on the outskirts of the provincial capital.</t2188> <t2189>The official announcement, the fourth in less than two years, indicated that this was evident because for nearly six months, there had been no news about him.</t2189> <t2190>Suddenly, while Úrsula and Amaranta were mourning their ancestors anew, a strange piece of news arrived.</t2190> <t2191>Colonel Aureliano was still alive, but it was clear he was not siding with his own government, as he had joined the federal forces that were prevailing in several other Caribbean countries.</t2191> <t2192>He went to lands with different names, increasingly unfamiliar compared to the name of his homeland.</t2192>
<t2193>It was later learned that the idea inspiring him at that moment was the idea of uniting the federal forces of Central America to sweep away the royalist regimes from Alaska to Patagonia.</t2193>
<t2194>After a few years he left, the first letter that Úrsula received from him was a crumpled and smudged letter passed hand-to-hand from the city of Santiago de Cuba.</t2194>
<t2195>- We have lost it forever, - Ursula exclaimed when reading the letter because Christmas on the day of the apocalypse will appear on that road.</t2195>
<t2196>The person whom the elder spoke to, the first person he showed the letter to, was General José Raquén Moncada, a member of the Royalist faction.</t2196><t2197>"It's a pity," General Moncada commented, "that this Aureliano is not a Royalist."</t2197><t2198>He genuinely admired him.</t2198><t2199>Like many Royalist civil officials, José Raquén Moncada had fought to defend his party and had risen to the rank of general in combat, despite not having strategic talent.</t2199><t2200>On the contrary, like many in his party, he was opposed to the militaristic regime.</t2200><t2201>He viewed the military class as a group of undisciplined, lazy, adventurous, and greedy individuals with experience in opposing civil officials to enrich themselves in chaotic situations.</t2201><t2202>Intelligent, courteous, with a rosy complexion, a lover of good food and cockfighting, he had once been the most formidable enemy of Colonel Aureliano Buendía.</t2202><t2203>He had established his command over professional military personnel throughout this vast coastal region.</t2203><t2204>Once, due to strategic agreements, he had to withdraw his troops from a town to hand it over to Colonel Aureliano Buendía's forces, leaving two letters for him.</t2204><t2205>In a long letter to the colonel, he invited him to join a joint campaign to make the war less brutal.</t2205><t2206>The other letter he asked the colonel to deliver to his wife, who lived in an area controlled by the Liberal forces.</t2206><t2207>Since then, even during the fiercest battles, the two commanders had agreed to ceasefires to exchange prisoners.</t2207><t2208>These were truce moments so cheerful that General Moncada took advantage of the time to teach Colonel Aureliano Buendía how to play checkers.</t2208><t2209>There were times when both men considered the possibility of combining the popular elements within both parties to eliminate the influence of professional military and political figures and establish a humane regime by fully exploiting the advantages of each doctrine.</t2209><t2210>When the war ended, while Colonel Aureliano Buendía frequently faced defeat and had to flee through ravines, General Moncada was appointed Inspector General in the village of Macondo. He dressed in civilian clothes, used unarmed police instead of the militia, enforced respect for all amnesty regulations, and assisted families of fallen Liberals.</t2210><t2211>He did everything he could to have Macondo chosen as a county town, and thus he was appointed mayor and cultivated an atmosphere of mutual trust among the populace, making them think of the war as a meaningless hardship of the past. Father Nicanor, emaciated by liver fever, was replaced by Father Coronel, nicknamed El Cachorro, a veteran of the Federalist wars.</t2211><t2212>Bruno Crespi had married Amparo Moscote.</t2212><t2213>Thanks to his ever-prospering toy and musical instrument store, he built a theater that Spanish touring companies included in their itineraries.</t2213><t2214>It was an open-air salon with long wooden benches, a felt backdrop adorned with Greek masks, and three ticket booths shaped like lion heads through whose open mouths tickets were sold to customers.</t2214>
<t2215>During this period, the school was also built.</t2215> <t2216>Don Mencho Escalona, an old teacher, was sent from the swamps to oversee the school.</t2216> <t2217>With the consent of the parents, he made the unruly boys kneel and walk on the gravelly yard and forced the talkative children to eat hot peppers.</t2217> <t2218>Aureliano Segundo and José Arcadio Segundo, the twin sons of Santa</t2218> <t2219>Sofía de la Piedad, were the first students to sit in the classroom with a blackboard, chalk, and aluminum cups engraved with their names.</t2219> <t2220>Remedios inherited her mother's true beauty and began to be known by the name Remedios the Beauty.</t2220> <t2221>Despite her old age, despite having endured many bereavements and numerous hardships, Úrsula remained as vigorous as ever.</t2221> <t2222>With the help of Santa Sofía de la Piedad, she resumed her candy business and in a short time, not only recovered the wealth her son had squandered during the war, but also filled dried gourds with pure gold and buried them in her bedroom.</t2222>
<t2223>"As long as God lets me live," - the old man often said, - "there will never be a shortage of money in this house of lunatics."</t2223>
<t2224>Everything was going smoothly like that, when suddenly Auréliano José deserted the ranks of the federal army of Nicaragua, escaped onto a German ship, and then appeared right in his own kitchen.</t2224> <t2225>He returned healthy as a horse, tanned and with thick hair like an Indian, with the secret intention of marrying Amaranta.</t2225>
<t2226>When Amaranta saw him walk in, even though he hadn't said anything, she immediately knew why he had returned.</t2226><t2227>They sat at the same table but didn't dare look each other in the face.</t2227><t2228>But after two weeks of being back, even with Ursula present, he still looked her straight in the eyes and said, "I always think of you, my dear."</t2228><t2229>Amaranta fled from him.</t2229><t2230>She guessed and maneuvered to avoid encountering him in unexpected places and times.</t2230><t2231>She clung to Remedios the Beauty, not leaving her side for a moment.</t2231><t2232>She blushed with shame the day her nephew asked how long she would keep wearing the black ribbon on her arm, because she understood the question as a hint about her chastity.</t2232><t2233>When he returned home, she immediately locked her bedroom door.</t2233><t2234>But for many nights, hearing his gentle, steady snoring from the next room, she felt so reassured that she let her guard down.</t2234><t2235>Nearly two months after Aureliano José returned, one night towards dawn, she felt him enter her room.</t2235><t2236>Instead of fleeing or screaming as she had planned, she surrendered herself to a light feeling of rest and satisfaction.</t2236><t2237>She felt him crawling into the bed, just as he had since he was a child, as he always had, and she couldn't stop the cold sweat and chattering teeth when she realized he was completely naked.</t2237><t2238>"Get out!" she whispered, feeling like she was suffocating from curiosity.</t2238><t2239>"Get out or I'll scream."</t2239><t2240>But Aureliano José knew exactly what he needed to do, because he was no longer a boy afraid of the dark but a seasoned soldier.</t2240><t2241>From that night on, they continued their silent struggles until dawn.</t2241><t2242>"I am your aunt," Amaranta whispered wearily.</t2242><t2243>"I am almost like your mother, not just because of my age but because I raised you and taught you everything, except breastfeeding you."</t2243><t2244>At dawn, Aureliano slipped away, and the next night towards dawn, he returned to her room, increasingly pleased to find her door still unlocked.</t2244><t2245>There was never a moment when he didn't love his aunt intensely.</t2245><t2246>He often saw her image in the dark rooms of occupied villages, especially the most squalid ones, and recognized her physically through the smell of dried blood on the bandages of the wounded, in the sudden fear of death.</t2246><t2247>He saw his aunt everywhere and at all times.</t2247>
<t2248>He had fled from his aunt by deliberately erasing his memories, not only through the vast distance but also through the blood-curdling battles that his comrades had ranked among the most terrifying. However, the more he tried to erase his aunt's image in the horrors of war, the more the war resembled Amaranta.</t2248> <t2249>Thus, he painfully lived in exile, trying to kill his aunt by his own death until he heard a soldier tell a fairy tale about a man who married his own aunt, who was also his niece, and whose son was his own great-uncle.</t2249>
<t2250>- Can't one marry their own aunt? - he asked, looking horrified.</t2250>
<t2251>- Not only can it be taken, - a soldier answered him, - but even more than that.</t2251> <t2252>We are waging this war against these priests so that people can take their own mothers.</t2252>
<t2253>Fifteen days later, he deserted.</t2253> <t2254>He found the real-life Amaranta more captivating than the Amaranta in his memory, saw her as sadder and more graceful, and although in reality she was past her prime, she was more passionate than ever in the darkness of the bedroom, more than ever she abandoned herself to the frenzy of denial.</t2254> <t2255>"You are a scoundrel," Amaranta told him when he pursued her.</t2255> <t2256>"What you are doing to your poor aunt is improper, even if the Pope himself granted absolution."</t2256> <t2257>Aureliano José promised to go to Rome, promised to crawl on his knees across Europe kissing the Pope's feet just to beg his aunt to "grant him entry."</t2257>
<t2258>- Not just because of that, - Amaranta tried to resist, - but also because they will give birth to children with pig tails.</t2258>
<t2259>Aureliano José deliberately ignored all reasoning.</t2259>
<t2260>- Even if I have to give birth to pangolins, I am willing, - he pleaded.</t2260>
<t2261>One early morning, he went to Mr. Catarinô's shop after he could no longer endure the pain of repressed lust.</t2261> <t2262>There, he had an affair with a woman with sagging breasts, who was friendly and easygoing, and who satisfied his hunger for a while.</t2262> <t2263>He intended to treat Amaranta badly.</t2263> <t2264>He saw her sitting in the hallway, working on a sewing machine—a skill she had learned very quickly—and he did not greet his aunt.</t2264> <t2265>Amaranta felt a weight lifted off her shoulders and she herself did not understand why she now thought of Colonel Gerineldo Márquez, why she longed for the afternoons playing checkers, and why she wanted him to be her husband.</t2265> <t2266>Aureliano José still did not know that he had lost his place in his aunt's heart, so one night, unable to control his desire, he sneaked into Amaranta's bedroom again.</t2266> <t2267>This time she firmly and resolutely rejected him.</t2267> <t2268>From then on, she locked her bedroom door tightly every night.</t2268>
<t2269>A few months after Aureliano José returned, a woman with an open demeanor, smelling of jasmine, brought a five-year-old child to the house.</t2269> <t2270>She said that the child was the son of Colonel Aureliano Buendía and that she had brought him for Úrsula to name.</t2270> <t2271>No one doubted the origin of the unnamed child: he resembled the Colonel exactly as he did when his father took him to see the ice.</t2271> <t2272>The woman recounted that the boy was born with his eyes wide open, scrutinizing those around him with the inquisitiveness of an adult, and that she herself was startled by his unblinking, intense gaze.</t2272>
<t2273>"Exactly," said Ursula.</t2273> <t2274>"The only thing missing is for the chair to spin around when he looks at it."</t2274> <t2275>She named him with Aureliano's first name and his mother's last name, because the law did not allow a child to bear the father's last name if the father had not acknowledged him.</t2275> <t2276>Colonel Moncada agreed to be his godfather.</t2276> <t2277>Although Amaranta requested that the boy stay with the girl's family, the mother did not agree</t2277><t2278>.</t2278>
<t2279>At that time, Úrsula still did not know the custom of parents sending their virgin daughters to the bedrooms of warriors as if they were letting hens into the coop of handsome roosters.</t2279> <t2280>But after a whole year, she learned: nine more sons of Colonel Aureliano Buendía were brought to the house to be named by her.</t2280> <t2281>The oldest, brown-skinned with blue eyes, did not resemble his paternal side at all, and was already ten years old.</t2281> <t2282>They brought children of all ages to the house, with all skin colors, but all were boys, and all seemed lonely—a characteristic that forced people to acknowledge their origins.</t2282> <t2283>One child, who was very mature for his age, broke several vases and some cups, as it seemed that whatever his clumsy hands touched, he broke.</t2283> <t2284>Another had red hair, with snail-like eyes just like his mother's, and wore his long hair tied up in bunches just like a woman's.</t2284> <t2285>This boy walked into the house very naturally, as if he had been raised there, and then went straight to the old cabinet in Úrsula's room and demanded, "Give me the wind-up dancer."</t2285> <t2286>Úrsula was startled.</t2286> <t2287>She opened the cabinet.</t2287> <t2288>After finding the dancer wrapped in a pair of stockings.</t2288> <t2289>It was a gift from Pietro Crespi and no one had remembered it.</t2289> <t2290>In less than twelve years, seventeen children, fathered by the colonel and scattered across the regions he passed through during the war, were named Aureliano along with their mothers' surnames.</t2290> <t2291>At first, Úrsula stuffed their pockets with money, and Amaranta wanted to keep them to raise.</t2291> <t2292>But both concluded that it was best to give each child a commemorative gift and accept to be their godmothers.</t2292> <t2293>"We will just name them," Úrsula said as she recorded the names and addresses of the mothers, and the places and dates of the children's births in a notebook. "Surely Aureliano has planned this, so he will decide everything when he returns."</t2293> <t2294>During lunch, while commenting with General Moncada about this "proliferation," she expressed her wish that Colonel Aureliano Buendía would have the opportunity to return and reunite with his children in his own home.</t2294>
<t2295>- Please don't worry, - General Moncada said mysteriously, - the Colonel will return sooner than you think.</t2295>
<t2296>What Colonel Moncada knew well and did not want to reveal during lunch was that Colonel Aureliano Buendía was preparing for the longest, most thorough, and bloodiest uprising compared to any of the uprisings he had planned until now.</t2296>
<t2297>The political atmosphere became tense again, just like the political atmosphere of the months before the outbreak of the first war.</t2297> <t2298>The cockfights that were once encouraged by the mayor had been abolished.</t2298> <t2299>Captain Aquiles Ricardo, the commanding officer of the troops stationed in Macondo, took power and managed all affairs in the town.</t2299> <t2300>The Liberals accused him of being a provocateur.</t2300> <t2301>"A terrible event will happen," Úrsula told Aureliano José.</t2301> <t2302>"Do not go out after six in the evening, do you hear me?"</t2302> <t2303>Her warnings all became useless.</t2303> <t2304>Aureliano José, just like Arcadio in the previous period, did not listen to his grandmother.</t2304>
<t2305>It seems that this is the result of your return home, the result of an indifferent lifestyle towards the daily pressing tasks.</t2305><t2306>It was these things that awakened in you the talent for womanizing and laziness of your uncle José Arcadio.</t2306><t2307>Your wave of feelings for Amaranta had completely subsided, leaving no trace of injury.</t2307><t2308>You indulged in somewhat debauched activities, sometimes playing billiards, sometimes relieving boredom with random women you encountered, sometimes embezzling money that Úrsula had forgotten in the desk drawer.</t2308><t2309>You only returned home to change clothes, "Children of this house, all of them are the same," Úrsula lamented.</t2309><t2310>"At first, they are raised very carefully, so they are all obedient, virtuous, and gentle, seemingly not even daring to kill a fly.</t2310><t2311>Yet as soon as they start to grow a bit of a beard, they become wayward and unruly."</t2311><t2312>Unlike Arcadio, who never knew his origins, you knew that you were the son of Pilar Ternera, who had hung a hammock for you to nap in right at her house.</t2312><t2313>In their loneliness, they went beyond a mother-son relationship to have an affair with each other.</t2313><t2314>Pilar Ternera was completely desperate.</t2314><t2315>Her laughter was hoarse like the sound of a frog's croak.</t2315><t2316>Her breasts had sagged, her belly and thighs had become flabby from being the victim of her inescapable fate as a promiscuous woman.</t2316><t2317>But her heart resigned to aging without a hint of bitterness.</t2317><t2318>She was a fat, talkative woman.</t2318><t2319>With the emptiness of an unfortunate Madam, she had given up the hopeless illusion that the cards brought her, and she found solace in the love of others.</t2319><t2320>In the house where Aureliano José napped, the neighboring girls entertained random lovers. "Aunt Pilar, can I borrow a room?" they would easily say to her once they were inside the house. "Whatever," Pilar replied.</t2320><t2321>And if anyone was standing there, she would explain:</t2321>
<t2322>- I would be happy to know that others are in ecstasy on the bed.</t2322>
<t2323>She never took money for renting rooms.</t2323> <t2324>She never refused to do favors for others, nor did she ever turn away the many men who sought her out, even when she was well past her prime.</t2324> <t2325>She indulged them not for money or love, but simply for the occasional pleasure, that's all.</t2325> <t2326>Her five daughters, who inherited her passionate nature, wandered the thorny paths of life from their adolescence.</t2326> <t2327>Of the two sons she raised, one joined Colonel Aureliano Buendía's army and died in combat, while the other was crippled and imprisoned at fourteen when he tried to steal a henhouse in a village in the marshlands.</t2327> <t2328>In appearance, Aureliano José was tall and robust, with a rosy brown complexion, and for half a century, the "cards" had foretold his arrival to her, just as they had for all the men the cards had predicted, Aureliano José came to her marked by death.</t2328> <t2329>She saw it in the cards.</t2329>
<t2330>- Don't go out tonight, - she said, - stay here and sleep because Carmelita Montiel keeps insisting that I take her to your room.</t2330>
<t2331>Aureliano Jose did not grasp the deep meaning hidden in that pleading invitation.</t2331>
<t2332>- Tell her to wait for me until midnight! - he said.</t2332>
<t2333>You went to the theater.</t2333><t2334>There, a Spanish troupe advertised a play called The Fox's Dagger, which was actually a script by Xôrida but had to be renamed by order of Captain Akilêt Ricacđô, because the Liberals called the Royalists "the strong ones."</t2334><t2335>It wasn't until presenting the ticket at the entrance that Aurêlianô Hôsê realized that Captain Akilêt Ricacđô, along with two soldiers carrying long guns, was controlling the crowd.</t2335><t2336>"Watch out, Captain," Aurêlianô warned him.</t2336><t2337>"The one who will make me raise my hands hasn't appeared yet."</t2337><t2338>The captain tried to use force to control him, but Aurêlianô Hôsê, not carrying any weapons at the time, ran away.</t2338><t2339>The captain ordered to shoot, but the soldiers did not obey.</t2339><t2340>"That's a Buendía," one of them said to the captain.</t2340><t2341>Furious, the captain grabbed a gun, ran into the middle of the street, and fired.</t2341>
<t2342>- You old goat! - the captain still managed to shout.</t2342> <t2343>- God willing, he is Colonel Aureliano Buendía.</t2343>
<t2344>Cacmêlita Môntiên, a young girl in her early twenties, had just finished bathing with orange leaf water and was laying rosemary leaves on Pila Tecnêra's bed when she heard the sound of gunfire.</t2344> <t2345>Aurêlianô Hôsê was ready to share the happiness with Cacmêlita Môntiên that Amaranta had denied him, ready to have seven children with her and be faithful to her until he died in her arms, but the bullet pierced his back and shattered his chest.</t2345> <t2346>It was a bullet guided by a misinterpretation of the cards.</t2346> <t2347>Captain Akilêt Ricacđô, who was supposed to die that night, indeed died four hours before Aurêlianô Hôsê.</t2347> <t2348>Almost as soon as the sound of his own gunshot echoed, he was struck down by two bullets simultaneously, and the origin of those bullets was never discovered.</t2348> <t2349>Following that was a rumbling shout that shook the entire night sky:</t2349>
<t2350>- Long live the Liberal Party? Long live Colonel Aureliano Buendía!</t2350>
<t2351>At midnight, when Aureliano José breathed his last due to blood loss, and Carmelita Montiel saw her murky future in the cards, more than four hundred men had marched past the theater door and fired pistol shots at the abandoned corpse of Captain Aquiles Ricardo.</t2351> <t2352>It took a new patrol team to carry the bullet-riddled and soggy corpse of the captain, which was as mushy as bread soaked in soup, onto a wheelbarrow to be taken away.</t2352>
<t2353>Contrary to the wrongful actions of the government troops, General José Raquén Moncada used his political influence, donned his uniform again, and took full control in Macondo.</t2353> <t2354>However, he did not hope that his conciliatory attitude could avoid the inevitable.</t2354> <t2355>The news in September was full of contradictions.</t2355> <t2356>While the government declared that it had control over the entire country, the Liberals received secret notifications about armed uprisings in the interior regions.</t2356> <t2357>The current regime did not acknowledge that the country was in a state of war, and thus, in an official bulletin, it did not dare to declare that the military court continued to try Colonel Aureliano Buendía in absentia and had sentenced him to death in absentia.</t2357> <t2358>They ordered the sentence to be carried out by whichever military unit first captured him.</t2358> <t2359>"This means he is still alive," Úrsula declared in front of General Moncada.</t2359> <t2360>But even he did not know for sure.</t2360>
<t2361>In reality, it shows that Colonel Aureliano Buendía had already been in the country for more than a month.</t2361> <t2362>Confused by conflicting sources of information and deceived by the supernatural actions of Colonel Aureliano Buendía in remote regions of the country, General Moncada still did not believe the colonel had returned to the country until he was officially informed that the colonel had taken control of two coastal provinces.</t2362> <t2363>"Sir, I sincerely congratulate you," he said to Úrsula while showing her the telegram. "Your son will be here soon."</t2363> <t2364>For the first time in her life, Úrsula became worried. "And what will you do?" she asked.</t2364> <t2365>General Moncada had also asked himself that question many times.</t2365>
<t2366>- I will remain silent about what your son did, sir! - he replied, - that is fulfilling one's duty.</t2366>
<t2367>At dawn on the first of October, Colonel Aureliano Buendía, with a thousand heavily armed soldiers, attacked Macondo, and the army was ordered to resist to the end.</t2367>
<t2368>By noon, when General Moncada was having lunch with Ursula, the cannon fire from the revolutionary forces shook the entire town and shattered the front wall of the town's treasury.</t2368> <t2369>"They are as heavily armed as we are," General Moncada sighed, "but they fight more fiercely than we do."</t2369> <t2370>By two in the afternoon, as the sky and earth trembled under the roaring cannon fire from both sides of the battle, he bid farewell to Ursula with the feeling that he was being defeated.</t2370> <t2371>"May God grant that you do not welcome Aureliano into this house tonight," he said, "if not, please embrace him for me, because I do not expect to see him again."</t2371>
<t2372>That night he was captured while trying to flee Macondo after writing a long letter to Colonel Aureliano Buendía, reminding him of their shared plans to make the war less brutal and wishing him decisive victory against the corrupt officers and greedy politicians of both parties.</t2372> <t2373>The next day, Colonel Aureliano Buendía had lunch with him at Úrsula's house, where he was being detained until the revolutionary military court decided his fate.</t2373> <t2374>It was a family gathering.</t2374> <t2375>But while the two adversaries forgot the war to reminisce about old memories, Úrsula had a sorrowful feeling that her son had become a completely different person.</t2375> <t2376>She had that feeling from the moment he entered the house, protected by a noisy squad of guards.</t2376> <t2377>This squad had searched all the rooms until they ensured there was no danger.</t2377> <t2378>Colonel Aureliano Buendía not only acknowledged this rude and intrusive action but also issued a firm order, forbidding anyone, including Úrsula, from approaching him within three meters until the guards had finished positioning themselves around the house.</t2378>
<t2379>He wore a common coarse fiber military uniform, without any rank or insignia, and high boots with spurs caked in mud and dried blood.</t2379> <t2380>On his belt, he carried a pistol in a worn leather holster, his hand always resting on the grip, a gesture that perfectly matched the high alertness and determination in his eyes.</t2380> <t2381>His head, now with tightly curled hair, seemed to have been dried.</t2381> <t2382>His face, once tanned by the Caribbean sun and wind, now bore a cold, steely expression.</t2382> <t2383>With a hidden coldness, he was ready to face the inevitable onset of old age.</t2383> <t2384>Compared to when he left, he was taller, thinner, and paler, and showed the first signs of an unending melancholy.</t2384> <t2385>"My God," Úrsula said to herself in alarm.</t2385> <t2386>"Now he is capable of anything."</t2386> <t2387>Indeed, he was such a person.</t2387> <t2388>Not content with ordering the burial of battlefield corpses in a common grave, he also tasked Colonel Roque Carnicero with urgently convening military tribunals, while he personally took on the heavy burden of implementing thorough land reforms to eradicate the royalist regime.</t2388> <t2389>"We must stay one step ahead of the party politicians," he told his advisors. "When they open their eyes to reality, they will be faced with accomplished facts."</t2389> <t2390>It was then that he decided to review the land deeds, even those made a hundred years ago, and thus discovered the forged deeds legalized by his brother José Arcadio.</t2390> <t2391>With a single stroke, he invalidated those deeds.</t2391> <t2392>In a final courteous gesture, he pondered for an hour and then visited Rebeca to inform her of his decision.</t2392>
<t2393>In the dimly lit thatched house, there was only the lonely widow who had once been the confidante to whom he poured out his secret affections and who had persistently watched from her home for the soldiers to come and execute him, ultimately saving him from death.</t2393><t2394>Now she was merely a shadow of the past.</t2394><t2395>She hid herself in black mourning clothes that covered her from head to toe, and with a cold heart, she was almost oblivious to the war.</t2395><t2396>Colonel Aureliano Buendía felt as if the sulfur from her bones was seeping through her skin, and that she flickered like a ghostly flame in the stagnant air that still reeked of gunpowder.</t2396><t2397>He began to advise her to grieve less for her husband and to open the windows to let fresh air into the house, and to forgive the world for the death of José Arcadio.</t2397><t2398>But Rebeca was beyond all worldly temptations.</t2398><t2399>After having futilely sought them in the taste of earth, in the scented letters of Pietro Crespi, on the bed that shook under the wild passion of her husband, she had found a serene atmosphere in that house, where unending memories brought past recollections to life, wandering through the closed rooms like real people.</t2399><t2400>Lying on the wicker rocking chair, looking at Colonel Aureliano Buendía as if he were a figure from the past, Rebeca showed no sign of distress when she learned that the lands José Arcadio had illegally seized would now be returned to their rightful owners.</t2400>
<t2401>- Aureliano, let people do what you have decided.</t2401> <t2402>She always thought, and now she is even more convinced, that you are a despicable man.</t2402>
<t2403>The examination of land documents was concluded simultaneously with the emergency trials conducted by Colonel Herinendo Marquez, and these trials all ended with the execution of all the government army officers captured as prisoners by the revolutionaries.</t2403> <t2404>The final military trial was the trial of General Jose Raquen Moncada.</t2404> <t2405>Ursula intervened.</t2405> <t2406>"He is the best authority among the authorities in Macondo," she told Colonel Aureliano Buendia: "I don't even need to mention his kindness and the respectful attitude he has shown us, because you, more than anyone, understand him well."</t2406> <t2407>Colonel Aureliano Buendia gave her a scrutinizing look:</t2407>
<t2408>- I cannot violate the court's rules of procedure, - he argued with his mother - If you feel the need to say something, please go before the military court and say it.</t2408> <t2409>Ursula not only spoke by herself but also mobilized all the mothers of revolutionary military officers currently living in Macondo.</t2409> <t2410>The elders, who were the founders of the village of Macondo, among them the women who participated in the adventurous journey through the jungle to find a place to settle, took turns praising the virtues of General Moncada.</t2410> <t2411>Ursula was the last among them.</t2411> <t2412>Her honor, her prestige, her commanding and persuasive demeanor in her declaration, all of these at some point made the judges feel embarrassed.</t2412> <t2413>"You have played this terrifying game very seriously and you have done it right because you are fulfilling your duty," she said to the judges.</t2413> <t2414>"But please remember that as long as God allows us to live, we are still your mothers, and even if you are very revolutionary, we still have the right to strip you and give you a few lashes if you do not listen."</t2414> <t2415>As those words still echoed in the school turned military camp, the court withdrew to deliberate.</t2415> <t2416>By midnight, General José Raquén Moncada was sentenced to death.</t2416> <t2417>Despite Ursula's fervent plea for clemency, Colonel Aureliano Buendía refused to reduce the sentence.</t2417> <t2418>Just before dawn, he went to visit the condemned man in his cell.</t2418>
<t2419>- Remember, - he said to him, - that I am not the one shooting you.</t2419> <t2420>The revolution is shooting you.</t2420>
<t2421>General Moncada, upon seeing him enter the cell, did not even bother to get up.</t2421>
<t2422>- Get lost, buddy, - he said.</t2422>
<t2423>Since returning until that moment, Colonel Aureliano Buendía had not found the opportunity to visit General Moncada with all his heart.</t2423> <t2424>He was so surprised to see how much the general had aged, to see his hands trembling, to see him resigned to death, and thus at that moment he felt such self-contempt that he could mistake it for pity:</t2424>
<t2425>- You must know better than I do, - he said, - that all military courts are a joke, because in reality you have to pay for the crimes of others, because this time we will win by all means.</t2425> <t2426>If you were in my position right now, wouldn't you do the same?</t2426>
<t2427>General Moncada sat up and used his shirt tail to clean his tortoiseshell-framed glasses. "It could be," he said, "but what I have to worry about is not you shooting me, because in any case, for people like us, this kind of death is inevitable."</t2427> <t2428>He placed the glasses on the bed and then took off his pocket watch.</t2428> <t2429>"What I worry about," he continued, "is that from someone who hated professional generals, who tirelessly fought against them, who pondered about them, now you are no different from them.</t2429> <t2430>In life, there is no type of person who represents the baseness of humanity as much as you."</t2430> <t2431>He took off his wedding ring and the medal of Saint Remedios the Virgin, and placed them beside the watch and the glasses.</t2431>
<t2432>- At this point, - he concluded, - you are not only the most typical bloodthirsty dictator in the history of our country, but you will also shoot old Ucsula just to put your conscience at ease.</t2432>
<t2433>Colonel Aureliano Buendía stood there like a statue.</t2433> <t2434>General Moncada handed him glasses, medals, a watch, a wedding ring, and then changed his tone:</t2434>
<t2435>- But never mind, I did not want you to come just to scold you, - he said.</t2435> <t2436>- I want to ask you to deliver these things to my wife.</t2436>
<t2437>Colonel Aureliano Buendía received the items and put them in his pocket.</t2437>
<t2438>- Does she still live in Manaurê?</t2438>
<t2439>- Still in Manaurê? - General Moncada confirmed, - still the house behind the church where you went to send that letter.</t2439>
<t2440>- I'm willing to do it.</t2440> <t2441>José Raquén? - Colonel Aureliano Buendía said.</t2441>
<t2442>When he stepped outside into the damp green wind, his face was wet and blurred as it had been at dawn before, and only then did he understand why he had decided that the sentence had to be carried out right in the prison yard and not next to the cemetery wall.</t2442> <t2443>The firing squad lined up right in front of the door, presenting arms to him, their commander.</t2443>
<t2444>- You can take him away now, - the colonel ordered.</t2444>
<t2445>Chapter 9</t2445>
<t2446>Colonel Gerineldo Márquez was the first to perceive the futility of war.</t2446> <t2447>As the supreme commander in Macondo, he maintained regular telegraphic conversations twice a week with Colonel Aureliano Buendía.</t2447> <t2448>Initially, these exchanges confirmed the flow of the bloody conflict, where at any given moment its contours allowed for the establishment of a destination point and the projection of future directions.</t2448> <t2449>Although he never allowed himself to become entangled in intimate emotional matters, even with his closest comrades, Colonel Aureliano Buendía now maintained a familiar manner of speaking that allowed the person on the other end of the line to recognize him.</t2449> <t2450>Many times, he extended these telegraphic conversations beyond the allotted time, letting them drift into idle chatter.</t2450> <t2451>However, as the war expanded and intensified, his image gradually faded into a nebulous and unreal world.</t2451> <t2452>The clicks and clacks of his telegraph key became increasingly distant and vague, and they coalesced into words that gradually lost all meaning.</t2452> <t2453>At this point, Colonel Gerineldo Márquez merely listened, feeling uncomfortable with the sensation that he was communicating via telegraph with a stranger from another world.</t2453>
<t2454>- I understand now, Aureliano! - He gently pressed the manip to finish - Long live the Liberal Party!</t2454>
<t2455>Colonel Herinendo Marquez had completely lost touch with the war.</t2455> <t2456>What had once been a practical action, an uncontrollable passion of youth, had now become for him an old story, an empty void.</t2456> <t2457>The only place for him to escape that loneliness was Amaranta's sewing room.</t2457> <t2458>Every afternoon he would visit her.</t2458> <t2459>He liked to watch her hands as she folded the fabric on the sewing machine table, while Remedios the Beauty turned the crank.</t2459> <t2460>For hours and hours they would be together, not saying a word.</t2460> <t2461>While Amaranta was content with maintaining the intense flame of his love, he could not understand the purpose of that heart.</t2461> <t2462>When she learned that he would return, Amaranta felt a breathless joy.</t2462> <t2463>But when she saw him mingling with Colonel Aureliano Buendia's noisy guard as they entered the house, saw him worn out from his overseas struggles, saw him aged by time and neglect, saw him sticky with sweat mixed with road dust, smelling of animal odor, saw him unattractive with his arm immobilized in a sling, she was so disappointed she wanted to die. "Oh my God," she said, "this is not the man I had been waiting for."</t2463> <t2464>However, the next day, he came to the house looking more dapper: shaved and bathed, his mustache smelling of lavender, and his arm no longer in a sling.</t2464> <t2465>He brought her a prayer book bound in hard cover inlaid with mother-of-pearl.</t2465>
<t2466>- Oh, how strange men are, - she said because she didn't know what else to say.</t2466> <t2467>- Their whole life is a struggle against the priests, yet they go and give away religious books.</t2467>
<t2468>Since that day, even during the fiercest days of the war, he would visit her every afternoon.</t2468> <t2469>Many times he turned the wheel of the sewing machine when Remedios the Beauty was not present.</t2469> <t2470>Amaranta felt awkward in the face of his unwavering loyalty, his dedicated spirit, and the fact that this man, entrusted with many powers by her brother, would still leave his weapons in the living room when entering the sewing room.</t2470> <t2471>However, for four long years, he had confessed his love to her, and she had found ways to decline without causing him pain, because she did not love him, but also felt she could not live without him.</t2471> <t2472>Remedios the Beauty, who seemed indifferent to everything in life and was considered intellectually underdeveloped, did not appear so indifferent after all and showed some affection for Colonel Gerineldo Márquez.</t2472> <t2473>Amaranta immediately realized that the girl she had raised, though not yet at puberty, was already the most beautiful girl in Macondo.</t2473> <t2474>In her heart, she felt a resurgence of the hatred she had once harbored for Rebeca and prayed to God not to let her wish for the girl's death, so she banished her from the sewing room.</t2474> <t2475>That was the period when Colonel Gerineldo Márquez began to feel a deep aversion to war.</t2475> <t2476>He employed his caution, his gentle nature, ready to forsake the glory he had exchanged for the best years of his life, just to win Amaranta's heart.</t2476> <t2477>But he could not persuade her.</t2477>
<t2478>On an August afternoon, suffering from his persistent attitude, Amaranta stayed in her bedroom to cry for the loneliness of her fate, after having resolutely rejected his steadfast heart:</t2478>
<t2479>- Let's forget each other forever, - she said to him, - because we have missed our chance.</t2479>
<t2480>That afternoon, Colonel Gerineldo Márquez hurriedly came in response to Colonel Aureliano Buendía's telegram.</t2480> <t2481>It was a routine conversation that did not alter the stagnant war.</t2481> <t2482>At the end, Colonel Gerineldo Márquez gazed at the desolate streets, the crystal-like drops of water on the almond tree leaves, and then he lost himself in loneliness.</t2482>
<t2483>- Aureliano, - he said sadly through the telegraph - it's raining in Macondo!</t2483>
<t2484>There was a long silence on the line.</t2484> <t2485>Suddenly, the machine emitted the irritated clicks and clacks of Colonel Aureliano Buendía.</t2485>
<t2486>- Don't be so absent-minded, Herinendo, - the signals said.</t2486> <t2487>- Of course it rains in August.</t2487>
<t2488>It had been a long time since the two had seen each other, to the point that Colonel Herinendo Márquez was surprised by such a provocative reaction.</t2488> <t2489>However, two months later, when Colonel Aureliano Buendía returned to Macondo, that surprise turned into a joy that left him stunned.</t2489> <t2490>Even Úrsula was astonished to see how much he had changed.</t2490>
<t2491>Hiding himself in an overcoat despite the sweltering heat, he quietly returned without any bodyguards, bringing along three female spirits.</t2491> <t2492>He let them stay with him in one house, while he lay on a hammock almost all day.</t2492> <t2493>He hardly read the daily telegrams reporting the war situation.</t2493> <t2494>Once, Colonel Herinendo Marquez asked him for instructions to resolve an issue that was becoming increasingly troublesome in international relations at a border location, and he replied:</t2494>
<t2495>- Do not bother me with these trivial matters, - he ordered the colonel. - Go ask that Almighty.</t2495>
<t2496>Perhaps that was the most stressful phase of the war.</t2496> <t2497>The landlords of the Liberal faction, who had supported the revolution from the beginning, secretly allied with the Royalist landlords to halt the land reform.</t2497> <t2498>The politicians who had funded the war, even from abroad, openly opposed his bold decisions.</t2498> <t2499>But he ignored everything, even this deposition of power.</t2499> <t2500>He did not reread his poems, now five volumes thick and often forgotten at the bottom of a trunk.</t2500> <t2501>At night or during siesta time, as usual, he would call a mistress to the hammock to frolic with her and then fall asleep like a dead ox, oblivious to the world.</t2501> <t2502>At that moment, only he understood that his passionate heart had been permanently exiled to chaos.</t2502> <t2503>Initially, intoxicated by the victories, returning amidst such obvious triumphs, he had ascended to the pinnacle of glory.</t2503> <t2504>He was content to cling tightly to Duke Marlborough, his great master in the art of war, who wore a tiger-skin coat with intact sharp claws that commanded respect from adults and fear from children.</t2504> <t2505>That was when he decided that no one, not even Ursula, could come within three meters of him.</t2505> <t2506>With short and decisive commands, he determined the fate of the world from the center of a circle drawn with white chalk by his attendants wherever he went, and only he stepped inside.</t2506> <t2507>For the first time in Manaure, after executing General Moncada, he hastily fulfilled his victim's last wish.</t2507> <t2508>The widow accepted the glasses, medals, watch, and wedding ring but did not allow him to step through the door.</t2508>
<t2509>- Colonel, you shouldn't enter the house, - she said.</t2509> <t2510>- You manage the battlefield, and I, I manage my own home.</t2510>
<t2511>Although Colonel Aureliano Buendía did not show his anger outwardly, his mind was only at ease when he knew that his entourage had looted and burned the widow's house to ashes. "Please take care of your heart, Aureliano," Colonel Gerineldo Márquez said to him at that time.</t2511> <t2512>"You are rotting while still alive."</t2512> <t2513>At this time, he organized the second conference of the rebel generals ready to die.</t2513> <t2514>He met with everyone: the idealists, the ambitious ones, the adventurers, those with deep personal grudges, and even the thieves.</t2514> <t2515>There was also a Royalist official who had fled the court for embezzling public funds.</t2515>
<t2516>A lot of people know nothing, including why they are fighting.</t2516> <t2517>In the chaotic scene of the crowd, where differences in political views almost caused an internal explosion, a formidable force stood out: General Teófilo Vargas.</t2517> <t2518>He was a pure-blooded Indian, rough, illiterate, but possessed a hidden cunning and had the talent to use the magic of Asia Minor to bind his soldiers in a kind of mad fanaticism.</t2518> <t2519>Colonel Aureliano Buendía convened a conference with the aim of consolidating the command of the insurgent forces into his own hands to counter the maneuvers of the politicians.</t2519>
<t2520>General Theophilo Vachat had anticipated his plans: In a few hours, he managed to break the unity of some of the most famous commanders and jumped to take overall command.</t2520> <t2521>"That is a fierce beast to be wary of," he told his subordinate officers.</t2521> <t2522>"For us, that man is even more dangerous than the Minister of Defense."</t2522>
<t2523>In the midst of that moment, a young captain, who often stood out from others due to his sentimental nature, cautiously raised his hand.</t2523>
<t2524>- Colonel, it's really too easy, - the young captain said probing. - Just kill him and be done with it!</t2524>
<t2525>Colonel Aureliano Buendía was not surprised by the cold nature of the proposal that was made, but rather he was surprised by the manner in which a minor element had anticipated his own thoughts.</t2525>
<t2526>- Don't wait for me to give that order, - he said.</t2526>
<t2527>Indeed, he did not give the order.</t2527> <t2528>But fifteen days later, General Teófilo Vargas was hacked to pieces in a sudden ambush, and Colonel Aureliano Buendía took over as the overall commander.</t2528> <t2529>It was on the night his new position was acknowledged by all the rebel commanders that he suddenly woke up in a panic, screaming for someone to bring him an overcoat.</t2529> <t2530>An internal cold that pierced to the bone made him ache, and even at noon, it did not leave him in peace.</t2530> <t2531>This condition lasted for several months until he developed chronic insomnia.</t2531> <t2532>The dream of power began to crumble piece by piece.</t2532> <t2533>In an attempt to quell the internal chill, he ordered the execution of the young officer who had suggested killing General Teófilo Vargas.</t2533> <t2534>His orders were carried out before they were issued, often even before he intended them, and frequently exceeded what he dared to wish for.</t2534> <t2535>Lost in the loneliness of boundless power, he began to lose his bearings.</t2535> <t2536>He was irritated by the people in the occupied villages who cheered him, feeling that they were the same people who had cheered his enemies.</t2536> <t2537>Everywhere he went, he encountered young men who looked at him with his own eyes, spoke with his own voice, greeted him with the same suspicion with which he had greeted them, and all claimed to be his sons.</t2537> <t2538>He felt fragmented, repeated, and lonelier than ever.</t2538> <t2539>He realized that his own officers had deceived him.</t2539> <t2540>He fought with Duke Marlborough. "The best friend," he often told himself, "is the one who has just died."</t2540>
<t2541>He was exhausted by the ambiguous circumstances, by the vicious cycle of that prolonged war in which he always found himself at the same place, only growing older and weaker without knowing why, how, or until when.</t2541> <t2542>There was always someone standing outside the white chalk circle.</t2542> <t2543>It was the person demanding money from him, the one with a child suffering from whooping cough, or the one who wanted to sleep forever because they could no longer endure the taste of war's filth in their mouth, and yet still tried to stand at attention to report: "Colonel, everything is normal, sir."</t2543> <t2544>And it was precisely that normalcy, which meant nothing was happening, that was the most terrifying aspect of the brutal war.</t2544> <t2545>Abandoned by omens and to escape the cold that would chase him to his death, he sought the only refuge in the village of Macondo, in the warmth of those distant memories.</t2545> <t2546>His laziness was so extreme that when informed of a party delegation coming to discuss a ceasefire, he merely stirred in his hammock without waking up.</t2546>
<t2547>- Take them to the brothel, - he said.</t2547>
<t2548>There were six lawyers in tailcoats and felt hats trying to endure the oppressive heat of a scorching November.</t2548>
<t2549>Ursula let them stay right in her house.</t2549> <t2550>Most of the day, they stayed locked in the bedroom to secretly discuss matters.</t2550> <t2551>In the evening, they demanded a guard of soldiers and a group of accordion players, then they went to Catarino's store on their own.</t2551> <t2552>"Don't bother them," Colonel Aureliano Buendía instructed. "I already know what they want."</t2552> <t2553>At the beginning of December, the long-awaited discussion, predicted to be an endless debate, took place in less than an hour.</t2553> <t2554>In the stifling living room, next to the automatic piano covered by a white cloth, this time Colonel Aureliano Buendía did not sit in the center of the white chalk circle drawn by his entourage.</t2554> <t2555>He sat on a chair among his political advisors.</t2555> <t2556>Wrapped in a wool coat, he quietly listened to the brief proposals of the special envoys.</t2556> <t2557>First, they proposed to abandon the inspection of land titles to regain the support of the Liberal landowners.</t2557> <t2558>Then they proposed to give up the fight against the influence of the church to win the favor of the parishioners.</t2558> <t2559>Finally, they proposed to abandon the ideal of equality of rights between illegitimate and legitimate children to preserve the hierarchy within the family.</t2559>
<t2560>- It means, - Colonel Aureliano Buendía smiled as the messengers stopped reading, - we are fighting just to seize power.</t2560>
<t2561>- Those are just temporary reforms, - a delegate retorted. - Now more than ever, the fundamental thing is to expand the popular base of the struggle.</t2561> <t2562>After that, we will review it.</t2562>
<t2563>A political advisor of Colonel Aureliano Buendía hurriedly joined the debate.</t2563>
<t2564>- What nonsense, - he said, - if these reforms are correct, it means that the Monarchy is good.</t2564> <t2565>If with these reforms we can broaden the popular base of the war, it means that the Monarchy has a broad popular base.</t2565> <t2566>And overall, it means that for nearly twenty years we have been fighting against the conscience of our nation.</t2566>
<t2567>He was about to continue speaking, but Colonel Aureliano Buendía signaled him to stop.</t2567> <t2568>"Please, doctor, don't waste time," he said.</t2568> <t2569>"What is of significant importance is that from now on, we fight with the sole purpose of seizing power."</t2569> <t2570>He continued to smile, took the papers handed to him by the messengers, and prepared to sign them.</t2570>
<t2571>- In times of change, one must adapt, - he concluded, - we completely accept that.</t2571>
<t2572>The people on his side looked at each other in astonishment.</t2572>
<t2573>- Please forgive me, Colonel, - Colonel Herinendo Marquez said softly - Is that a betrayal?</t2573>
<t2574>Colonel Aureliano Buendía paused his ink-dipped pen in mid-air and unleashed the full weight of his authority on Colonel Gerineldo Márquez:</t2574>
<t2575>- Hand over your weapons to me, - he commanded.</t2575>
<t2576>Colonel Aureliano Buendía stood up, placing his weapon on the table.</t2576>
<t2577>- Report to the barracks, - Colonel Aureliano Buendía ordered him.</t2577> <t2578>- You will be subject to the judgment of the revolutionary court.</t2578>
<t2579>Then he signed the declaration, handed the documents to the envoys, and said to them:</t2579>
<t2580>- Gentlemen, you already have all your documents there.</t2580> <t2581>Please enjoy them.</t2581>
<t2582>Two days later, Colonel Gerineldo Márquez was accused of being a traitor and sentenced to death.</t2582> <t2583>Lying in his hammock, Colonel Aureliano Buendía remained indifferent to all pleas for clemency for Colonel Gerineldo Márquez.</t2583> <t2584>The night before the execution, despite the order not to disturb him, Úrsula visited him right in his bedroom.</t2584> <t2585>Dressed in a pitch-black outfit from head to toe, with an unusually solemn demeanor, she stood for three minutes while speaking to him.</t2585> <t2586>"I know you will shoot Gerineldo," she said resolutely, "and I cannot do anything to stop this execution.</t2586> <t2587>But I tell you, right after I see his corpse, I will swear before the remains of my parents, before the spirit of José Arcadio Buendía, I will swear before God that no matter where you flee, I will drag you out and I will kill you with my own hands."</t2587> <t2588>Before leaving the room, without waiting to hear her son's rebuttal, she concluded:</t2588>
<t2589>- Just like I would kill you if you were born with a pig's tail.</t2589>
<t2590>In that long, endless night, when Colonel Gerineldo Márquez remembered the beautiful afternoons in Amaranta's sewing room, Colonel Aureliano Buendía was tormented and restless, trying to tear apart the long, interminable night, the tough shell surrounding his loneliness.</t2590> <t2591>The only happy period of his life, since that distant afternoon when his father took him to see the ice, had taken place in the gold workshop, where time passed as he diligently cast little gold fishes.</t2591> <t2592>He had to ignite thirty-two civil wars, escape death many times, and seek glory like a pig rooting through garbage for food, only to discover nearly ten years later the meaning of the proverb "ignorance is bliss," an inherent trait of gullibility.</t2592>
<t2593>At dawn, exhausted and weary from a sleepless night, he appeared in the death row cell an hour before the execution.</t2593> <t2594>"The charade is over, my friend," he said to Colonel Herinendo Marquez.</t2594> <t2595>"We'll be out of here before the mosquitoes get a chance to execute you."</t2595> <t2596>Colonel Herinendo Marquez couldn't contain his disdain for such arrogance.</t2596>
<t2597>"Don't go anywhere, Aureliano," he protested.</t2597> <t2598>"I would rather die than see you become a blood-stained knife."</t2598>
<t2599>- You won't see me anymore, - Colonel Aureliano Buendía said.</t2599> <t2600>- Put on your shoes and help me end this dirty war.</t2600>
<t2601>Even while speaking, he still couldn't imagine that starting a war is always much easier than ending it.</t2601> <t2602>He needed a year of bloody fighting to force the government to make peace proposals beneficial to the insurgents and another year to persuade his own faction to unanimously accept those conditions.</t2602> <t2603>He had gone to unwanted extremes of crime to suppress the uprisings of his own officers, who continued to fight stubbornly against the betrayal of the victory of the rebellion, only to end up helping the enemy forces completely dominate them.</t2603> <t2604>Never had he been as fierce a warrior as he was then.</t2604> <t2605>The clear realization that he was ultimately fighting for his own liberation and not for abstract ideas or slogans that politicians could manipulate according to specific circumstances, instilled in him a new, exhilarating enthusiasm.</t2605> <t2606>Colonel Hernando Márquez, who fought for defeat with all the zeal and loyalty he had once fought for victory, opposed his useless fear.</t2606> <t2607>"Don't worry," he said.</t2607> <t2608>"Dying isn't as easy as people think."</t2608> <t2609>In his case, that was true.</t2609> <t2610>The firm belief that his death would be foretold endowed him with a strange invulnerability, an immortality so certain that he couldn't be injured in dangerous battles and ultimately allowed him to achieve a defeat far more difficult, bloody, and costly than achieving a victory.</t2610>
<t2611>During nearly twenty years of war, Colonel Aureliano Buendía was often at home, but the hurried state each time he returned, the noisy military apparatus that followed him across the country, as well as the mythical aura that enveloped his image, and even the image of him in that mythical aura, made no one feel close to him, including Úrsula herself. All of these factors turned him into a stranger.</t2611> <t2612>The last time he was in Macondo, he used a house for his three mistresses, and apart from that, he was seen at his own home only two or three times, when he had time to return home for a meal at the family's invitation.</t2612> <t2613>Remedios the Beauty and the twin boys, who were born amidst the chaos, hardly knew him.</t2613> <t2614>Amaranta could not find a connection between the image of her brother who had spent his youth in the workshop casting goldfish and the image of a legendary warrior who isolated himself from the rest of humanity by a distance of three meters.</t2614>
<t2615>But when she knew that a ceasefire was imminent and thought that once again he would return to being an ordinary person, and finally he would be free to reunite with the hearts of his loved ones, the family affection, which had been dormant for quite a while, now revived stronger than ever.</t2615>
<t2616>- Finally, - Ursula said, - once again we have a man in the house.</t2616>
<t2617>Amaranta was the first to suspect that they had caused him to fail permanently.</t2617> <t2618>A week before the ceasefire, when he entered the house without a guard, followed by two barefoot soldiers who placed all the rough goods carried by mules in the hallway, and a box of letters, the only remaining item of his once splendid belongings, she saw him pass by the sewing room and called him.</t2618> <t2619>Colonel Aureliano Buendía seemed to barely recognize her.</t2619>
<t2620>- It's me, Amaranta! - she joked, happy that her brother had returned and showing him the black band.</t2620> <t2621>- Look at this, brother.</t2621>
<t2622>Colonel Aureliano Buendía flashed a smile identical to the one he had when he saw her bandaging his hand for the first time, that time he returned to Macondo sentenced to death.</t2622>
<t2623>- Oh, how terrible, - he said, - time passes so quickly!</t2623>
<t2624>The standing army has the duty to protect the house.</t2624> <t2625>He returned in a state of being escorted, scorned, and accused of reigniting the war with the intention of selling it at a higher price.</t2625> <t2626>He shivered with fever and cold, and once again, his armpits were swollen.</t2626> <t2627>Six months before hearing the news of an armistice, Ursula had opened and cleaned the room of the couple, then burned incense in every corner, thinking that he would return to spend his old age beside Remedios' long-unused dolls.</t2627> <t2628>But in reality, in the last two years, he had repaid life for what he had enjoyed, including his share of old age.</t2628> <t2629>As he passed the jewelry workshop that Ursula had meticulously prepared, he did not recognize even the bunch of keys already inserted in the lock.</t2629> <t2630>He felt nothing at all, not even the major or minor damages left by the passage of time in the house, and that after being away for so long, if a person still retains their memories intact, it must be seen as a disaster.</t2630> <t2631>He did not feel the slightest sorrow over the peeling lime on the walls, the cobwebs in every corner, the dust covering the begonias, the termite holes in the beams, or the moss on the windowsills.</t2631> <t2632>He sat on the porch, still wearing his boots and wrapped in his coat, as if waiting for the rain to stop, and sat like that all afternoon watching the rain fall on the begonias.</t2632> <t2633>At that moment, Ursula realized that it had been a very long time since she had him in this house.</t2633>
<t2634>"If it's not war; - he thought, - then it can only be death."</t2634> <t2635>It was an extremely clear prediction, so convincing that he equated it with an omen.</t2635> <t2636>That night during dinner, the boy impersonating Aureliano Segundo held the bread with his left hand and scooped soup with his right hand.</t2636> <t2637>His twin brother, impersonating José Arcadio Segundo, held the bread with his right hand and scooped soup with his left hand.</t2637> <t2638>Their movements were so synchronized that it was impossible to think that two people were sitting opposite each other; it seemed like one person looking into a mirror.</t2638> <t2639>The scene of the twin children empathizing with each other since they became aware that they were identical was repeated to welcome the newly returned person.</t2639> <t2640>But Colonel Aureliano Buendía did not notice it either.</t2640> <t2641>He seemed estranged from everything, even the sight of Remedios the Beauty walking by naked to the bedroom did not catch his attention.</t2641> <t2642>Úrsula was the only one who dared to disturb his deep contemplation:</t2642>
<t2643>- If you need to leave again, - the old man said to him in the middle of the meal, - at least you should do something so that we can remember how we lived tonight!</t2643>
<t2644>So it was no surprise at all that Colonel Aureliano Buendía realized that Úrsula was the only one who had guessed the pain in his heart, and for the first time in many years, he dared to look directly into her eyes.</t2644> <t2645>Her skin was wrinkled, her teeth were crooked, her hair was withered, and the look in her eyes was full of astonishment.</t2645> <t2646>He compared her with the old image of her that he still retained, the image of her on the afternoon when he had predicted that the boiling pot of soup would spill off the table, and indeed it had fallen to the ground and shattered into pieces.</t2646> <t2647>Immediately, he recognized the wrinkles, the rough patches, the calluses, the scars that had marked her skin over more than half a century of hard work, and he realized that those marks did not stir his heart in the slightest.</t2647> <t2648>Immediately, he tried to find in his heart the place where feelings had rotted away, and he could not find it.</t2648> <t2649>At least, at other times, he felt ashamed when he suddenly caught Úrsula's scent on his own skin, and many times he felt that her thoughts had intertwined with his own.</t2649> <t2650>But all of that was overshadowed by the war. Even at that moment, Remedios, his wife, was just a faint image of someone who could have been his daughter.</t2650> <t2651>The girls he had known in the loneliness of love, and who had borne his offspring across the coastal region, left no mark on his feelings.</t2651> <t2652>Most of them had entered his room to sleep when it was dark and had left before dawn, and the next day they were just a vague memory in his mind.</t2652> <t2653>The only feeling that remained intact against the ravages of time and war was the memory of his brother José Arcadio when they were both children, not yet knowing love, only mischief.</t2653>
<t2654>- Forgive me, mother, - he said in response to Ursula's request.</t2654> <t2655>- It's just that this war has destroyed everything.</t2655>
<t2656>In the days that followed, he busied himself with erasing every trace of his existence from this world.</t2656> <t2657>He cleared out the jewelry workshop, leaving only items that did not remind anyone of him, distributed his clothes to the guards, and with the same regretful thought his father had when he buried the spear that killed Prudencio Aguilar, he buried his weapons in the yard.</t2657> <t2658>He kept only a pistol with a single bullet.</t2658> <t2659>Úrsula did not dare to interfere with his work.</t2659> <t2660>Only once did she advise him, and that was when he was about to tear up the carefully preserved photograph of Remedios, which was always illuminated by a lamp.</t2660> <t2661>"This portrait has long ceased to belong to you," she told him.</t2661> <t2662>"It is a family heirloom."</t2662> <t2663>The night before the armistice agreement was signed, when there was nothing left in the house to remind anyone of him, he took the chest containing five volumes of poetry to the bakery while Santa Sofía de la Piedad was preparing to light the oven.</t2663>
<t2664>- Use this to start the fire, - he said, handing her the roll of yellowed paper.</t2664> <t2665>- The fire will catch quickly because it's all old stuff.</t2665>
<t2666>Santa Sophia de la Piedad, the silent woman, the gentle woman, the one who never argued with anyone, not even with her own children, immediately recognized that it was a forbidden act.</t2666>
<t2667>- Those are important documents, - she said.</t2667>
<t2668>- It's nothing important, - the colonel said.</t2668> <t2669>- Those are completely private pages meant only for the writer to read.</t2669>
<t2670>- Then, please, uncle, burn it for me, - she said.</t2670>
<t2671>Not only did he burn the paper, but he also took an axe to chop the barrel into pieces and put everything into the furnace.</t2671> <t2672>A few hours earlier, Pila Tecnêra had come to visit him.</t2672> <t2673>After many years without seeing her, Colonel Aureliano Buendía was extremely surprised to see that she had aged significantly and gained a lot of weight, that she had lost her loud, ringing laugh, but he was also immensely astonished by her accurate card-reading skills. "Keep your mouth shut," she had told him, and he wondered if, at another time during the peak of his glory, if she had told him that, would it have been an unexpected insight that influenced his fate.</t2673> <t2674>Shortly thereafter, when the doctor responsible for his health had finished cleaning the pus from his two armpits, without any particular interest, he simply asked him where exactly the heart was located.</t2674> <t2675>The doctor pointed to the location of the heart and then used a dirty cotton swab dipped in red medicine to draw a circle on his chest.</t2675>
<t2676>On the fourth day, the day the armistice agreement was signed, the scene brightened under the rain and the pleasantly warm weather.</t2676> <t2677>Colonel Aureliano Buendía appeared in the kitchen before five o'clock and, as usual, drank unsweetened coffee.</t2677> <t2678>"You were born on a day just like this," Úrsula told him.</t2678> <t2679>"Everyone was surprised by your wide-open eyes."</t2679> <t2680>He didn't pay attention to her words, because he was listening to the soldiers preparing, listening to the sharp bugle calls and the commands that were unsettling the dawn.</t2680> <t2681>Even after many years of war, those sounds seemed familiar to him, but this time they made his knees feel weak and gave him the same shiver he had felt in his youth when standing before a naked woman.</t2681> <t2682>He thought, in a confused way, at the moment he was most trapped in the snare of loneliness, that if he had married that girl, he would have been a man who did not wander through wars and did not carry glory, but a nameless, ordinary craftsman, a happy male.</t2682> <t2683>It was this late sadness, which did not stand out in his plans, that made his breakfast taste bitter.</t2683> <t2684>At seven in the morning, when Colonel Gerineldo Márquez came to find him to go with the group of revolutionary officers, he found him silent, contemplative, lonelier than ever.</t2684> <t2685>Úrsula intended to drape a new coat over his shoulders.</t2685> <t2686>"What will the government think," she said to him, "They will think that you surrendered simply because you were so destitute that you couldn't afford a new coat."</t2686> <t2687>But he still refused to take the coat.</t2687> <t2688>When he reached the door, seeing that it was still raining, he let her put José Arcadio Buendía's old felt hat on his head.</t2688>
<t2689>- Aureliano, my son, - at that moment she managed to say to him, - promise your mother that if you encounter any misfortune there, you will think of your mother.</t2689> <t2690>Promise me, my son!</t2690>
<t2691>With the elder, he gave a distracted smile, spread his hand with five fingers wide open, then without saying a word, he left his house to face the shouts, curses, and imprecations that followed him all the way to the village gate.</t2691> <t2692>Ursula bolted the door tightly with the intention of never opening it for the rest of her life.</t2692> <t2693>"We will rot to death inside," she thought.</t2693> <t2694>"We would rather let the ashes cover us in this house without men than let these wretched villagers enjoy watching us cry"...</t2694> <t2695>That entire morning, she searched every hidden corner to find a keepsake of her son but could not find anything.</t2695>
<t2696>The signing ceremony was held at a location about a few dozen kilometers from Macondo, right under the shade of a giant kapok tree, where the town of Neclandia was later established.</t2696> <t2697>The government representatives, party members, and the army surrendering their weapons were served by a noisy group of nuns in white robes, who looked like a flock of doves startled by the rain.</t2697> <t2698>Colonel Aureliano Buendía arrived at the location riding a mud-spattered donkey.</t2698> <t2699>He did not shave, and he was in more pain from the swelling under his arm than from the crushing defeat of his dreams, for he had reached the ultimate point of all belief, which surpassed both glory and the longing for glory.</t2699> <t2700>As per his request, the ceremony had no music, no fireworks, no ringing bells, no cheers, and no display of any kind that could disrupt the mournful nature of the armistice signing.</t2700> <t2701>A traveling photographer, having taken a picture of him—a portrait that could have been preserved—was forced to destroy the entire roll of film without checking each frame.</t2701>
<t2702>The ceremony almost took just enough time for the ink to dry on the signatures.</t2702> <t2703>The officers, still loyal to Colonel Aureliano Buendía until the last moment, sat around a rough wooden table placed in the center of the old circus tent, where the delegates were seated.</t2703> <t2704>Before signing the document, the representative of the President of the Republic intended to read aloud the surrender document, but Colonel Aureliano Buendía managed to protest in time.</t2704> <t2705>"We shouldn't waste time on formalities," he said, then proceeded to sign without reading the documents again.</t2705> <t2706>One of his officers then broke the heavy silence that had settled in the circus tent.</t2706>
<t2707>- Colonel, - the person said, - please, Colonel, could you make sure we are not the first ones to sign?</t2707>
<t2708>Colonel Aureliano Buendía paused.</t2708> <t2709>The document had made a round on the table in such absolute silence that one could read the signatures thanks to the scribbled pen marks on the paper.</t2709>
<t2710>The first signature spot is still blank.</t2710> <t2711>Colonel Aureliano Buendía is ready to sign.</t2711>
<t2712>- Colonel, - another officer of his said at that moment, - you still have enough time to sign, sir.</t2712>
<t2713>Without losing his composure, Colonel Aureliano Buendía signed the first copy.</t2713> <t2714>He had not yet signed the final copy when a young rebel colonel appeared at the door of the tent, holding the reins of a female mule loaded with two chests.</t2714> <t2715>Despite his youth, he exuded a bitter calmness.</t2715> <t2716>He was the treasurer of the revolutionary forces in the Macondo area. This young man had endured six grueling days on the road, dragging the starving mule to arrive in time for the signing of the armistice agreement.</t2716> <t2717>With the leisurely manner of someone who is disappointed, the young man unloaded the two chests, opened them wide, and then placed seventy-two gold bricks on the table, one by one.</t2717> <t2718>No one remembered that such a vast fortune still existed.</t2718> <t2719>In the tumultuous final years of the war, when the central command was disintegrating and the revolution had degenerated into a bloody brawl among the commanders, it was difficult to assign any responsibility to anyone.</t2719> <t2720>The rebels' gold, which had been melted into lumps and then coated with baked mud, was in fact not under anyone's control.</t2720> <t2721>Colonel Aureliano Buendía ordered the seventy-two gold bricks to be listed among the assets surrendered by the revolutionaries to the government, and concluded the signing ceremony without allowing anyone to deliver a speech.</t2721> <t2722>The thin, pale young man continued to stand in front of him, his amber eyes staring directly into his.</t2722>
<t2723>- And what else, young man? - Colonel Aureliano Buendía asked.</t2723>
<t2724>The young colonel gritted his teeth:</t2724>
<t2725>- The documents! - the young man said.</t2725>
<t2726>Colonel Aureliano Buendía handed him the certificate written by his own hand.</t2726> <t2727>After that, he drank a glass of lemonade and ate a biscuit distributed by the nuns; then he went to one of the tents prepared for him in case he wanted to rest.</t2727> <t2728>There, he took off his shirt and sat on the edge of a bed.</t2728> <t2729>At three fifteen in the afternoon, he pointed the muzzle of the revolver at the circle drawn on his chest with red medicine by the health officer and pulled the trigger. At that exact time in Macondo, Úrsula opened the lid of the pot of milk on the stove, surprised at how long it was taking to boil, and found it full of worms.</t2729>
<t2730>- They have killed Aureliano, - the old man exclaimed in shock.</t2730>
<t2731>The old woman looked out into the yard, obediently following her habit of solitude, and immediately she saw José Arcadio Buendía, drenched in rain and looking much older and sadder than when she had last seen him.</t2731> <t2732>"They killed him for treason," Úrsula judged, "and no one even bothered to close his eyes."</t2732> <t2733>As night fell, through her tears she saw golden round discs glowing orange, whizzing through the sky like lightning bolts, and she thought it was a sign of death.</t2733> <t2734>She still sat under the chestnut tree, her head resting on her husband's knee as she sobbed, while they brought her Colonel Aureliano Buendía, his eyes wide open with anger, wrapped in a cloak stained with dried blood.</t2734>
<t2735>He was not in any life-threatening danger.</t2735> <t2736>The bullet went straight through his chest to the point where the doctor threaded a medicated string from his chest to his back.</t2736> <t2737>"This is my masterpiece," he said to him with a pleased expression.</t2737> <t2738>It was the only spot where a bullet could pass through without causing any damage to any internal organs.</t2738> <t2739>Colonel Aureliano Buendía saw himself surrounded by miserable nuns chanting mournful hymns to pray for his soul to find peace in eternal rest, and he immediately regretted not shooting himself in the mouth as he had planned, and he had refrained from doing so only to mock Pila Tecnéra's prediction.</t2739>
<t2740>- If I still had power, - he said to the doctor - I would shoot you without any questioning.</t2740> <t2741>Not because you saved my life but because you made me a laughingstock to the world.</t2741>
<t2742>The failed suicide attempt restored his once-faded prestige.</t2742> <t2743>Those who had spread rumors that he sold out the war for a house with four walls made entirely of gold bricks affirmed that the suicide attempt was a noble act and thus declared him a martyr.</t2743> <t2744>Afterward, when he refused the Order of Merit awarded by the President of the Republic, even his mortal enemies came one by one to parade through his bedroom, urging him not to recognize the terms of the armistice agreement and to ignite a new war.</t2744> <t2745>Moved by the broad support of his old comrades-in-arms, Colonel Aureliano Buendía did not dismiss the possibility of fulfilling their wishes.</t2745> <t2746>On the contrary, there were moments when he seemed so enthusiastic about the idea of a new war that Colonel Gerineldo Márquez thought it would be declared at the slightest provocation.</t2746> <t2747>Indeed, the provocation came when the President of the Republic refused to grant war pensions to veterans of both the Liberal and Conservative sides until each individual case was reviewed and the war pension law was passed by Congress.</t2747> <t2748>"This is an abuse," Colonel Aureliano Buendía fumed, "People will die of old age while waiting for a response." </t2748> <t2749>For the first time, he left the rocking chair that Úrsula had bought for his convalescence and paced the room, reading a decisive telegram addressed to the President of the Republic.</t2749> <t2750>In this telegram, he denounced the government's initial violations of the Neclandia armistice agreement and threatened to declare war if the pensions were not resolved within fifteen days.</t2750> <t2751>His stance was so correct that it garnered the support of everyone, even the approval of the Conservative veterans.</t2751> <t2752>But the government's only response was to increase the number of guards at his door, ostensibly to protect the house and strictly prohibit all visits.</t2752> <t2753>Similar measures were applied nationwide to generals under house arrest.</t2753> <t2754>It was a timely, brutal, and effective campaign, so much so that two months after the armistice, when Colonel Aureliano Buendía had fully recovered, his closest comrades-in-arms were either dead, exiled, or had completely submitted to the public house arrest.</t2754>
<t2755>In December, Colonel Aureliano Buendía stepped out of the bedroom and just a glance at the hallway was enough for him to stop thinking about the war.</t2755> <t2756>With a vitality seemingly impossible for her age, Úrsula did everything to rejuvenate the house.</t2756> <t2757>"Now they will know who I am," she said when she was certain her son would live.</t2757> <t2758>"In this town, there will be no house more luxurious, more open to the four winds than this house of mad people."</t2758> <t2759>She ordered the house to be cleaned, whitewashed, replaced the furniture, refurbished the garden, planted new flowers, and opened all the doors: the main door and the windows, to let the brilliant summer light flood into the bedrooms.</t2759> <t2760>She decided to stop mourning the successive deaths of her loved ones, and she herself began to wear colorful, youthful dresses instead of the old, shabby ones.</t2760> <t2761>Music once again emanated from the automatic piano, making the house more lively.</t2761> <t2762>Upon hearing that music, Amaranta deeply missed Pietro Crespi, remembered the ivory-yellow gardenia on his lapel, and the lavender scent that emanated from him.</t2762> <t2763>And within her withered heart blossomed a pure feeling, cleansed by time.</t2763> <t2764>One afternoon, while tidying up the living room, Úrsula asked the house guards to lend a hand.</t2764> <t2765>The young commander of the guard allowed it.</t2765> <t2766>Gradually, Úrsula asked them to help with other tasks as well.</t2766> <t2767>She invited them to meals, gave them clothes and shoes, and taught them to read and write.</t2767> <t2768>When the government ceased the guard duty, one of those soldiers stayed to serve her for many years.</t2768>
<t2769>The New Year's festival dawned brightly with the young commander of the guard, driven mad by the reckless behavior of Remedios the Beauty, dying of love right next to her window.</t2769>
<t2770>Chapter 10</t2770>
<t2771>In his later years, lying on his deathbed, Aureliano Segundo remembered the rainy June afternoon when he walked into the bedroom to see his firstborn son for the first time.</t2771> <t2772>Although the child was weak and often cried, bearing no resemblance to anyone in the Buendía family, he did not have to think hard to come up with a name for him.</t2772>
<t2773>- We will call him José Arcadio, - he said.</t2773>
<t2774>Fernanda del Carpio, the beautiful wife he married last year, agreed to name the baby that way.</t2774><t2775>As for herself, Úrsula could not hide her vague pain. In the long history of the family, the practice of naming children the same from generation to generation allowed her to draw conclusions that were almost confirmed.</t2775><t2776>While those named Aureliano were melancholic yet very intelligent, those named José Arcadio were impulsive and bold; but all bore the mark of a tragic fate.</t2776><t2777>The only cases that were difficult to distinguish were those of José Arcadio Segundo and Aureliano Segundo.</t2777><t2778>In their childhood, both were so alike and mischievous that even Santa Sofía de la Piedad could not tell the twin brothers apart.</t2778><t2779>On the day of the naming ceremony, Amaranta put a saint medallion with their names engraved on each and dressed them in different colored clothes marked with their initials; but when they went to class, they swapped names, clothes, and medallions.</t2779><t2780>The teacher, Mencho Escalona, who had gotten used to identifying José Arcadio Segundo by his blue shirt, was suddenly confused when he discovered that this boy wore a medallion with the name Aureliano Segundo and that although the other boy claimed to be Aureliano Segundo, he wore a white shirt and a medallion with the name José Arcadio Segundo.</t2780><t2781>From then on, it was impossible to know exactly who was who.</t2781><t2782>Even when they had grown up and life had made them different, Úrsula continued to wonder if at some point they had made a mistake in their confusing game, they would have changed a lot.</t2782><t2783>Even in their youth, they were like two synchronized machines.</t2783><t2784>They woke up at the same time, felt the need to go to the bathroom at the same hour, suffered from the same ailments, and had identical dreams.</t2784><t2785>At home, everyone believed that their synchronized actions were a deliberate attempt to confuse people, but no one understood their true nature until one day Santa Sofía de la Piedad gave one of them a glass of lemonade, and later the other one said it lacked sugar.</t2785><t2786>Indeed, she had forgotten to put sugar in the lemonade.</t2786><t2787>Santa Sofía de la Piedad recounted this to Úrsula.</t2787><t2788>"All the children in this family are like that," she said, not at all surprised.</t2788><t2789>"They are crazy from birth."</t2789><t2790>Time passed and eventually ended the confusion of identities.</t2790><t2791>The boy in the confusing games, still called Aureliano Segundo, had the robust body of his grandfather, while the other, still called José Arcadio Segundo, had the slender build of the colonel, and the only thing they shared was the family's characteristic loneliness.</t2791><t2792>Perhaps the swapping of appearances, names, and characteristics was what made Úrsula suspect that from their childhood, they had been shuffled like a deck of cards.</t2792><t2793>The clear difference between the two was evident during the most intense period of the war when José Arcadio Segundo asked Colonel Gerineldo Márquez to take him to watch the executions.</t2793>
<t2794>Contrary to Ucsula's thoughts, his wish was fulfilled.</t2794> <t2795>On the contrary, Aureliano Segundo felt weak at the thought of being present at the execution.</t2795> <t2796>The boy only liked staying at home.</t2796> <t2797>At the age of twelve, he asked Ucsula what was in the closed room.</t2797> <t2798>"Just papers," she replied, "those are Melquíades' books and the strange things he wrote in his later years."</t2798> <t2799>The answer that should have reassured him only further stimulated his curiosity.</t2799> <t2800>He earnestly begged to be allowed to see, passionately promising her that he would not damage anything in there, to the point that Ucsula couldn't resist and had to give him the key.</t2800> <t2801>No one had entered the room since they carried Melquíades' corpse away; and a rusty iron lock that had long since seized up had been installed on the door.</t2801> <t2802>However, when Aureliano Segundo flung the windows open, a familiar beam of light seemed to illuminate the room as it always had; the room was not covered in dust, there were no cobwebs, but on the contrary, everything was clean, perhaps even more meticulously swept and polished than on the day of the funeral, the ink in the bottle was not dry, rust had not dulled the shine of the metal tools; even the embers in the stove where José Arcadio Buendía boiled mercury were still glowing.</t2802> <t2803>On the shelves were books bound in light brown cardboard resembling tanned human skin and even handwritten pages with fresh ink.</t2803> <t2804>Although the room had been closed for many years, the air there seemed cleaner than in other parts of the house.</t2804> <t2805>Everything was so new that a few weeks later when Ucsula brought in a bucket of water and a broom to sweep the floor, she found she didn't need to do anything.</t2805> <t2806>Aureliano Segundo was engrossed in reading a book.</t2806> <t2807>Although the book had lost its cover and had no title, the boy enjoyed the story of a woman sitting at a table picking up each grain of rice with chopsticks; the story of a fisherman borrowing a lead weight from his neighbor to fasten to his fishing net and the fish he later returned to the neighbor carrying a pearl in its belly; the story of a magic lamp that granted all wishes and flying carpets.</t2807>
<t2808>With an excited look, the boy asked Ursula if these stories were true, and she replied that they were, that a long time ago, the gypsies brought magic lamps and flying carpets to the village of Macondo.</t2808>
<t2809>- The thing is, - he sighed, - the world is becoming increasingly impoverished, and therefore, those things are no longer seen.</t2809>
<t2810>After finishing the book with many stories left incomplete due to missing pages, Aureliano Segundo turned to translating the handwritten manuscripts.</t2810> <t2811>It was an impossible task.</t2811> <t2812>The letters looked like clothes hanging on a wire, and overall it resembled sheet music more than a piece of literature.</t2812> <t2813>One scorching afternoon, while deciphering the manuscripts, the boy felt he was not alone in the room.</t2813> <t2814>Melquiades was sitting there, with his back to the window, hands resting on his knees.</t2814> <t2815>He still wore the bizarre overcoat and the wide-brimmed hat, sweat dripping from his hair down his temples, exactly as he had appeared to Aureliano and José Arcadio when they were young.</t2815> <t2816>Aureliano Segundo recognized him immediately, because that hereditary memory had been passed down from generation to generation, and it came to him from his grandfather's recollection.</t2816>
<t2817>- Hello, sir, - Aureliano Segundo said.</t2817>
<t2818>- Hello, young friend, - Menkyadet replied.</t2818>
<t2819>Since that time, for a few years, they met almost every afternoon.</t2819> <t2820>Melquiades talked to the boy about the world, trying to pass on his ancient knowledge, but he refused to translate the handwritten pages.</t2820>
<t2821>"No one should know the meaning until a hundred years have passed," the old man explained.</t2821> <t2822>Aureliano Segundo kept these meetings a secret forever.</t2822> <t2823>There were times when the boy felt his private world was being shattered, because Úrsula had entered the room just as Melquíades was present.</t2823> <t2824>But she did not see him.</t2824>
<t2825>- Who are you talking to? - the old man asked.</t2825>
<t2826>- Not telling anyone, right? - Aureliano Segundo replied.</t2826>
<t2827>- Your great-grandfather was the same way, - Ursula said, - He would just talk to himself.</t2827>
<t2828>Meanwhile, José Arcadio Segundo found satisfaction in watching an execution.</t2828> <t2829>All his life, he would forever remember the flash of the six bullets fired simultaneously and the echo of the gunshots reverberating from the surrounding mountains, then recall the sad smile and the startled eyes of the man being shot, who stood proudly as the blood soaked his shirt, who kept smiling even as they untied him from the execution post and placed him in a coffin filled with lime powder.</t2829> <t2830>"Still alive," he thought.</t2830> <t2831>"They are going to bury him alive."</t2831> <t2832>He was so terrified, so much so that from that moment on he cursed the military profession and war, not just because of the executions but mainly because of the disgusting habit of burying the executed alive.</t2832> <t2833>Thus, no one knew when he started ringing the church bells, began assisting Father Antonio Isabel, who was nicknamed El Cachorro and had replaced the parish priest, and started taking care of the fighting cocks raised in the monastery yard.</t2833> <t2834>When Colonel Gerineldo Márquez found out, he scolded the boy for a long time for learning trades that were condemned by the Liberals.</t2834>
<t2835>- The problem is, - the boy answered, - it seems I have become a Royalist.</t2835>
<t2836>You believe that as if it were an affirmation of misfortune.</t2836> <t2837>Colonel Aureliano Buendía, annoyed, recounted the story to Úrsula.</t2837>
<t2838>- The better, - the old man praised.</t2838> <t2839>- Oh Lord, he will become a monk so that finally God will come to this house.</t2839>
<t2840>Immediately, everyone knew that Father Antonio Isabel was preparing to conduct the first Holy Communion for the boy.</t2840> <t2841>Father taught him catechism while plucking the neck feathers of fighting cocks.</t2841> <t2842>Father used simple, easy-to-understand examples to explain to him while placing the hens in their nests, just as it happened with God on the second day of Creation, the day the chicks were formed in the eggs.</t2842> <t2843>From that time, the pastor showed the first signs of senility, which many years later led him to say that perhaps the devil had won the rebellion against God's will, who sits on the heavenly throne, not revealing his form before the eyes of the foolish.</t2843> <t2844>Forged by the courage of his teacher, a few months later, José Arcadio Segundo had become very knowledgeable in religious tricks to deceive the devil and also experienced in raising chickens.</t2844> <t2845>Amaranta sewed him a linen suit with a collar and tie, bought him a pair of white shoes, and gilded his name on the ribbons tied to the candle.</t2845> <t2846>Two nights before his first Holy Communion, Father Antonio Isabel closed the holy storeroom to conduct a confession ceremony with him, aided by a book listing sins.</t2846> <t2847>It was such a long list that the old pastor, who was used to going to bed at six o'clock, fell asleep in the rocking chair before finishing.</t2847>
<t2848>The questions were a revelation to José Arcadio Segundo.</t2848> <t2849>He was not surprised to see the priest ask him if he had been with a woman, and he proudly answered no, but he was bewildered when the priest asked if he had been with animals.</t2849> <t2850>In May, on the first Friday, he took communion with a heart aching from curiosity.</t2850> <t2851>Afterward, he asked Petronio, the sickly monk who kept the holy relics, lived in the bell tower, and who, according to rumors, ate fireflies to survive, and Petronio answered him: "It's because there was a vile brother who slept with a female donkey."</t2851> <t2852>José Arcadio Segundo was more astonished than ever, demanding further explanations to the point that Petronio lost his patience.</t2852>
<t2853>- I go on Tuesday evenings every week, - he confessed. - If you promise not to tell anyone, next Tuesday I'll take you with me.</t2853>
<t2854>Indeed, on the third day, Petronio carried a wooden chair that no one knew what it was used for until now, down from the bell tower, and led Jose Arcadio Segundo to a nearby garden.</t2854><t2855>The boy was so passionate about those adventurous nights that it was a long time before people saw him appear at Catarino's dance hall again. He became a cockfighter.</t2855><t2856>"Take those animals somewhere else," Ursula said when she first saw him bring the beautiful fighting cocks home.</t2856><t2857>"Those chickens have brought so much bitterness to this house, and now you want to bring more suffering to us?"</t2857><t2858>Jose Arcadio Segundo did not argue with his great-grandmother; he quietly took the fighting cocks to be raised at the house of his grandmother, Pilar Ternera, who was willing to indulge him so he could be present at her home.</t2858><t2859>Immediately, he demonstrated the knowledge of Father Antonio Isabel at the cockfighting ring, preparing enough money not only to enrich the chickens he raised but also to satisfy his adventurous spirit.</t2859><t2860>At this time, Ursula compared him to his brother and could not understand how two twins who were identical in childhood could now be so completely different.</t2860><t2861>She did not have to ponder this thought for long because Aureliano Segundo soon began to show signs of laziness.</t2861><t2862>When sitting in Melquiades' room, he was as contemplative as Colonel Aureliano Buendia in his youth.</t2862><t2863>But shortly before the Treaty of Neclandia, a chance encounter pulled him out of his inner world, forcing him to face real life.</t2863><t2864>It was a young woman, who sold lottery tickets with the prize of an accordion, who greeted him warmly.</t2864><t2865>Aureliano Segundo was not surprised because it often happened that people mistook him for his brother.</t2865><t2866>But he did not bother to correct her even when she tried to soften his heart with her sobbing, and thus she led him to her bedroom.</t2866><t2867>From the first meeting, she liked him so much that she cheated during the lottery draw to ensure he won the accordion.</t2867><t2868>After a few weeks, Aureliano Segundo realized that this woman alternated between sleeping with him and his brother, thinking they were one person, and instead of clarifying the situation, he ignored it to prolong the state of both brothers sharing the same woman.</t2868><t2869>He did not return to Melquiades' room.</t2869><t2870>Every afternoon, he was outside in the yard, engrossed in learning the accordion despite Ursula's scolding, who had banned music because the house was in mourning, and besides, she despised the accordion as a toy for vagabonds, successors of Francisco the Man.</t2870><t2871>However, Aureliano Segundo became a famous accordion player and remained famous even after marrying, having children, and becoming one of the most respected people in the town of Macondo.</t2871>
<t2872>In the span of a few months, he and his brother shared nights of pleasure with that woman.</t2872> <t2873>He followed his brother, disrupted his plans, and when he was sure that José Arcadio Segundo would not go to the woman that night, he would sneak in to sleep with her.</t2873> <t2874>One morning, he discovered his brother was ill.</t2874> <t2875>Two days later, he caught his brother clinging to the latrine, drenched in sweat and tears, crying, and then he understood.</t2875> <t2876>His brother confessed that the woman had abandoned him because he had given her gonorrhea.</t2876> <t2877>His brother also recounted how Pilar Ternera had treated the disease.</t2877> <t2878>Aureliano Segundo secretly endured the burning permanganate baths and drank diuretics.</t2878> <t2879>Both of them recovered after three months of silently enduring the pain.</t2879> <t2880>José Arcadio Segundo no longer saw the woman.</t2880> <t2881>Aureliano Segundo received his brother's forgiveness and stayed with the woman for the rest of his life.</t2881>
<t2882>The woman's name was Petra Cotes.</t2882> <t2883>She and her husband, who made a living from the lottery, came to Macondo in the midst of fierce warfare, and when her husband died, she continued the trade.</t2883> <t2884>She was a clean and youthful mulatto woman, with almond-shaped hazel eyes that made her face as fierce as a leopard's, but she had a generous heart and an exceptional talent for seduction.</t2884> <t2885>When Úrsula discovered that José Arcadio Segundo had become a cockfighter and Aureliano Segundo played the accordion during the lively nights at his mistress's house, she was furious.</t2885> <t2886>It seemed as if these two had concentrated within themselves all the family's vices and shortcomings, failing to inherit its precious virtues.</t2886> <t2887>Thus, she decided that no one would be named José Arcadio or Aureliano. However, when Aureliano Segundo had his first son and named him José Arcadio, she did not dare oppose him.</t2887>
<t2888>- Alright, I agree, - Ursula said, - but on the condition that I get to raise it.</t2888>
<t2889>Although he was already a hundred-year-old man and nearly blind because of the film that had almost covered his pupils, he still maintained his health, without any bad habits or senility.</t2889> <t2890>No one was better than him in teaching a distinguished man who could restore the family's honor, a man who had never heard of war, cockfighting, prostitutes, or the booming agricultural trades, which, according to Ursula's thinking, had led to the downfall of his lineage.</t2890> <t2891>"This boy will become a priest," he solemnly promised.</t2891> <t2892>"And if God lets me live, he will become the Pope."</t2892> <t2893>When they heard this, everyone burst out laughing, not just in the room but throughout the entire house, which was currently filled with the jovial friends of Aureliano Segundo. War, forgotten by his own poor memory, suddenly came alive in the sound of popping champagne corks.</t2893>
<t2894>- Come on, let's toast to the health of the Pope, - Aureliano Segundo said, raising his glass.</t2894>
<t2895>The guests all cheered in unison.</t2895><t2896>Afterward, the host played the accordion.</t2896><t2897>Firecrackers exploded and drums resounded throughout the village.</t2897><t2898>Early in the morning, the guests, tipsy from champagne, slaughtered six cows and laid the meat out on the street, ready to invite the crowd to join the festivities.</t2898><t2899>No one was surprised.</t2899><t2900>Since Aureliano Segundo took charge of the family, such celebrations had become commonplace, even though they never had as legitimate a reason as this one, which was to celebrate the birth of a Pope.</t2900><t2901>In a few years, he had amassed one of the largest fortunes in the swamp region without much effort, simply due to sheer luck, which was the extraordinarily rapid multiplication of his livestock.</t2901><t2902>Cows gave birth to triplets, hens laid eggs twice a day, and pigs grew at an astonishing rate.</t2902><t2903>No one could explain the wealth that seemed to be the result of some miraculous phenomenon.</t2903><t2904>"Now you must be frugal," Úrsula told her great-grandson who spent lavishly.</t2904><t2905>"Luck won't follow you for your entire life."</t2905><t2906>But Aureliano Segundo did not heed her advice.</t2906><t2907>The more champagne he uncorked to entertain his friends, the more his livestock reproduced wildly, and he became convinced that his good fortune did not stem from calculated business practices but from the influence of Petra Cotes, his mistress, whose love seemed to soften the heart of fate.</t2907><t2908>He was very confident that this was the source of his wealth, and therefore he never let Petra Cotes stay far from the livestock, and even after marrying and having children, he continued to live with her with Fernanda's complicity.</t2908><t2909>With a robust and muscular body like that of his great-grandfather and grandfather, but with a more cheerful and carefree disposition, Aureliano Segundo hardly had enough time to tend to his livestock.</t2909><t2910>All he needed to do was bring Petra Cotes to the barns, let her ride a horse around the farms, and that was enough for his animals to reproduce rapidly.</t2910>
<t2911>Like all the good things that had ever happened in his long life, that unmanageable wealth seemed predestined by fate.</t2911> <t2912>Even during the final period of the war, Petra Cotes still issued lottery tickets, and at times Aureliano Segundo had to steal money from Úrsula to cover all the expenses.</t2912> <t2913>They lived together comfortably, without any concerns except for making sure they slept together every night, even on days when they should abstain, frolicking until dawn.</t2913> <t2914>"That woman will be the ruin of you," Úrsula scolded her great-grandson whenever she saw him enter the house like a sleepwalker. "She has made you foolish, and one day we'll see you writhing in pain with a toad in your belly."</t2914> <t2915>José Arcadio Segundo, who took a long time to realize that his younger brother had outsmarted him, could not understand his brother's passion.</t2915> <t2916>He remembered Petra Cotes as an easy woman, more accurately as someone lazy in bed and completely dull when it came to love.</t2916>
<t2917>Ignoring Ursula's scoldings and his brother's mockery, Aureliano Segundo only thought of finding a job that would allow him to maintain the house for Fernanda and to die with her, on her and under her, in a night of wild passion.</t2917> <t2918>When Colonel Aureliano Buendía reopened the goldsmith workshop, drawn by the serene joy of old age, Aureliano Segundo thought that following the trade of making little gold fishes would also be a good idea.</t2918> <t2919>He spent many hours in the sweltering small room watching the hard metal sheets, patiently forged and carved by the Colonel, gradually turn into shimmering scales.</t2919>
<t2920>He found the job very meticulous, meanwhile the longing for Petra Cotes was so overwhelming and intense that just three weeks later he disappeared from the workshop.</t2920> <t2921>That was the period when Petra Cotes was making a fortune by using rabbits as prizes to run a lottery.</t2921> <t2922>These rabbits were born and grew rapidly.</t2922> <t2923>They were countless.</t2923> <t2924>Even though she increased the tickets and the number of draws many times, she still couldn't use up all the rabbits for the prizes.</t2924> <t2925>At first, Aureliano Segundo did not realize how these rabbits were reproducing.</t2925> <t2926>But one night, when no one in the village wanted to talk about the rabbit lotteries, he felt a thunderous noise right by the wall.</t2926> <t2927>"Don't be startled!" Petra Cotes said, "those are the rabbits!".</t2927> <t2928>They couldn't sleep any longer, tossing and turning with worry about the livestock.</t2928> <t2929>At dawn, Aureliano Segundo opened the door and saw the yard teeming with rabbits, their fur gleaming in the morning light.</t2929> <t2930>Petra Cotes laughed uncontrollably, unable to resist the urge to tease him:</t2930>
<t2931>- These rabbits were just born the night the crow took them - she said.</t2931>
<t2932>- Oh dear, that's so scary! - he said - Why don't we try with a cow?</t2932>
<t2933>A few days later, while cleaning the yard, Petra Cotes replaced the rabbits with a cow.</t2933> <t2934>A few months later, the cow gave birth to triplets.</t2934> <t2935>Everything started from there.</t2935> <t2936>In no time, Aureliano Segundo became a wealthy landowner, possessing vast lands and numerous herds of livestock, and he barely had enough time to expand his cattle pens and grazing fields further.</t2936> <t2937>It was an intoxicating wealth that even he found overwhelming, unable to restrain his exuberant display of joy.</t2937> <t2938>"Oh, cows, spread out because life is too short," he shouted.</t2938> <t2939>Úrsula wondered if he had committed a crime, if not a thief then a cattle rustler, and every time she saw him pop two champagne bottles just to spray the foam over his head with delight, she scolded him for being a wastrel.</t2939> <t2940>She never left him in peace, so one day Aureliano Segundo woke up with a calm joy, grabbed a basket of paper money, a bucket of paste, and a brush, humming her old songs.</t2940> <t2941>Francisco - The Man, then he pasted the one-peso bills on the walls of the house, from top to bottom, both inside and outside.</t2941> <t2942>The old house, which had been whitewashed since the purchase of the automatic piano, now looked strangely like a mosque. Amid the family's chaos, Úrsula's anger, and the villagers' joy as they poured into the streets to witness the spectacle of a man flaunting his wealth, Aureliano Segundo finished pasting the paper money on the house, from the front wall to the kitchen, including the toilet and bedroom, then threw the remaining money into the yard.</t2942>
<t2943>- Now then, - he said, - I hope that no one in this house will insult me about money anymore.</t2943>
<t2944>The story happened like this.</t2944> <t2945>Ursula ordered the peeling of the banknotes stuck with plaster from the walls and whitewashed the house. "Oh, my merciful God," she prayed, "make us poor again like when this village was first established, so that in the next life you won't punish us for wasting money."</t2945> <t2946>Her prayers were answered in the opposite way.</t2946> <t2947>Indeed, they were. A worker peeling the banknotes off the wall accidentally bumped into the statue of Saint Joseph, a giant plaster statue that someone had brought to the house when the war was about to end, and it shattered upon hitting the ground.</t2947> <t2948>Inside, it was filled with gold coins.</t2948> <t2949>No one remembered who had brought the life-sized statue to the house.</t2949> <t2950>"Three men brought it," Amaranta said.</t2950> <t2951>"They asked me to tell our family to keep the statue until the rainy season passed, and I told them to place it there, in that corner, so no one would bump into it, and they carefully left it there and never came back for it."</t2951> <t2952>Recently, Ursula had lit candles and prayed before the statue of Saint Joseph without suspecting that inside it were nearly two hundred kilograms of gold.</t2952> <t2953>The late revelation of her polytheistic faith deepened her worries.</t2953> <t2954>She cursed the valuable gold coins, stuffed them into three burlap sacks, and buried them in a secret location, waiting for the three strangers to come and claim them.</t2954> <t2955>Much later, in the hard years of her old age, Ursula would often interrupt conversations with visiting strangers to ask if, during the turmoil, they had left a plaster statue of Saint Joseph at her house for safekeeping during the rainy season.</t2955>
<t2956>Those events, which often made Ursula very anxious, were commonplace during this period.</t2956><t2957>Macondo was submerged in a miraculous devastation.</t2957><t2958>The mud-walled thatched houses of the founding fathers were now replaced by brick houses with cement floors and sunshades woven from small wooden slats.</t2958><t2959>These houses made the already hot atmosphere even more stifling at two in the afternoon.</t2959><t2960>The old village of José Arcadio Buendía now only had dusty almond trees ready to endure much harsher conditions, and the crystal-clear river whose prehistoric rocks had been shattered into fragments by the frenzied hammer blows of José Arcadio Segundo when he began dredging the river to establish a waterway.</t2960><t2961>It was a crazy dream comparable to the dreams of his ancestors, because the riverbed full of boulders and its rapids prevented boats from traveling from Macondo to the sea.</t2961><t2962>But José Arcadio Segundo, in his bold and reckless determination, threw himself into the work with fervor.</t2962><t2963>Until now, he had never revealed his calculative abilities.</t2963><t2964>Except for a brief affair with Petra Cotes, he had never known a woman.</t2964><t2965>Ursula considered him a prime example of the lack of intelligence that her family, in its enduring history, had produced.</t2965><t2966>He almost had no ability to stand out even though he was an expert cockfighter.</t2966><t2967>When Colonel Aureliano Buendía told him about the Spanish ship lying twelve kilometers from the sea, whose hull had turned to coal, which he had seen with his own eyes during the war, this story seemed mystical to others for a long time but was understandable to him.</t2967><t2968>He sold all his fighting cocks at the highest price, gathered the village men, and spent money on saws and chisels, then began the grand task of breaking rocks, dredging the riverbed, and overcoming rapids... "I know it all too well," Ursula said.</t2968><t2969>"It's as if time runs in circles and now we are back at the beginning."</t2969><t2970>When he was convinced that boats could navigate the river, José Arcadio Segundo meticulously presented his plans, and his brother gave him enough money for the work.</t2970><t2971>He was absent for a long time.</t2971><t2972>People were gossiping that his plan to buy a steamboat was just a ruse to get money from his brother when news spread: a warship was approaching the town.</t2972><t2973>The people of Macondo, who had long forgotten the feats of José Arcadio Buendía, flocked noisily to the riverbank and, with skeptical eyes, saw the first boat slowly approaching.</t2973><t2974>It was the first and also the last boat to dock there.</t2974><t2975>In reality, it was just a wooden raft pulled by twenty men walking with thick ropes. Standing at the end of the raft, with bright, enthusiastic eyes, José Arcadio Segundo directed this costly journey.</t2975><t2976>Accompanying him was a group of flamboyant village prostitutes, carrying luxurious parasols to shield from the harsh sun, draped in precious silk scarves, faces heavily made up, hair adorned with flowers, golden snakes coiled around their arms, and teeth inlaid with pearls.</t2976><t2977>That wooden raft was the only means of transportation that José Arcadio Segundo managed to push upstream to Macondo, and it was only that one time.</t2977><t2978>But he would never admit it was a failure of his initial endeavor; instead, he always declared it as his achievement, "a victory of willpower."</t2978><t2979>He placed all the calculated expenses of the trip on his brother's shoulders.</t2979><t2980>The only thing left from this unfavorable beginning was the fresh breeze brought to the town by the French-style prostitutes.</t2980><t2981>Their exquisite art of pleasing men changed the traditional ways of prostitution, and its social welfare significance toppled Catarino's store, turning the streets into a common market with Japanese-style lanterns and phonographs playing melancholic tunes.</t2981><t2982>They were the driving force behind the bloody Carnival festival that plunged Macondo into fear for three days, and its only lasting result was that it allowed Aureliano Segundo to meet Fernanda del Carpio.</t2982>
<t2983>Remedios the Beauty, chosen as the beauty queen.</t2983><t2984>Ursula, who had once trembled before the mesmerizing beauty of her great-granddaughter, could do nothing to prevent this selection.</t2984><t2985>Until that moment, she had tried every way to keep her from going out, except for attending mass with Amaranta, but she forced her to use a black veil to cover her face.</t2985><t2986>The less devout men, those who pretended to be priests to conduct irreverent masses at Catarino's store, went to church with the sole purpose of catching even a fleeting glimpse of Remedios the Beauty, whose legendary beauty was fervently discussed throughout the swamp region.</t2986><t2987>This happened long before they found an opportunity that was even more significant to them, because many of them, after beholding the beauty of Remedios the Beauty, never regained peaceful sleep.</t2987><t2988>The person who created that opportunity was a stranger who had forever lost the tranquility of his soul, had fallen into a state of contemplative melancholy and easily provoked suffering, and a few years later was crushed by a train because he fell asleep on the tracks.</t2988><t2989>From the moment he was seen at the church wearing a white and blue flannel suit, no one doubted that he was a stranger who had come from afar, possibly from some ancient city deep inland, lured by the beauty of Remedios the Beauty.</t2989><t2990>He was a very handsome, gallant, and courteous man, with a harmoniously proportioned body to the extent that if Pietro Crespi stood next to him, he would seem sickly and frail.</t2990><t2991>Many women whispered to each other with sad smiles that he was worthy of the girl.</t2991><t2992>He did not associate with anyone in Macondo. He appeared early on Sunday mornings, like a prince from a fairy tale riding a horse saddled with flannel and stirrups.</t2992><t2993>That was his manner of presence, because with that manner, from the very first time they saw him in the church, everyone agreed that it was a silent and heavy funeral, a secret pact, a bitter disappointment whose outcome could not be love between him and Remedios the Beauty, but had to be death.</t2993><t2994>On the sixth Sunday at church, the young man appeared holding a yellow rose.</t2994><t2995>He stood listening to the mass, as he had always stood, and when the mass ended, he stepped forward to block Remedios the Beauty's path and offered her the single rose.</t2995><t2996>She naturally accepted the flower, as if she had been prepared to receive this offering, and immediately, in a flash, she lifted her veil to reveal her face and smiled to thank him.</t2996><t2997>That was all the girl did.</t2997><t2998>But that fleeting moment was an immortal instant not only for the young man but also for all the men who had the honor of experiencing that poignant moment.</t2998>
<t2999>From that moment, the young man set up a band right next to Remedios the Beauty's window, and sometimes the band played until the next morning.</t2999> <t3000>Aureliano Segundo was the only one who sympathized with him and tried to bring him back to reality.</t3000> <t3001>"You shouldn't waste any more time," he told him one night. "The girls in this house are dumber than mules."</t3001> <t3002>He befriended him, invited him to bathe in champagne, and tried to make him understand that the girls in his family had "hearts of stone," but still couldn't shake his determination.</t3002> <t3003>Annoyed by the never-ending nights of music, Colonel Aureliano Buendía threatened to cure him of his lovesickness with the butt of his pistol.</t3003>
<t3004>Nothing could force him to give up that mad love, except for his own pitiable state of insanity.</t3004> <t3005>From a charming and decent man, he became ill-tempered and ragged.</t3005> <t3006>It was rumored that he had abandoned his power and wealth in his distant homeland, although in reality no one knew exactly where he came from.</t3006> <t3007>He became quarrelsome with the waiters in the refreshment bar, and then one day woke up drenched in his own filth right in Catarino's shop. The saddest part of his tragedy was that Remedios the Beauty never paid any attention to him, even when he appeared as a prince in her house.</t3007> <t3008>She nonchalantly accepted the golden rose without any ill intent, and rather enjoyed his overly generous gesture, lifting her veil to see him clearly, not to let him see her face.</t3008>
<t3009>In fact, Remedios the Beauty was not a person of this worldly realm.</t3009> <t3010>Even when she was well past puberty, Santa Sofía de la Piedad still had to bathe and dress her, and even after she became self-aware, the woman still had to keep an eye on her to prevent her from drawing animals on the walls with her own excrement.</t3010> <t3011>At twenty years old, she still hadn't learned to read or write, hadn't sat at the table to eat with utensils, and continued to walk around the house naked because her human essence couldn't tolerate any form of ceremony.</t3011> <t3012>When the young commander of the guard confessed his love to her, she simply rejected him because his rash words astonished her too much.</t3012> <t3013>"You see, isn't he such a fool?" she said to Amaranta.</t3013> <t3014>"He told me he was dying because of me, as if I were some kind of cholera," she added.</t3014> <t3015>When she saw him actually dead by her window, Remedios the Beauty reaffirmed her initial feeling:</t3015>
<t3016>- See that? - she said critically, - the guy is really stupid!</t3016>
<t3017>It seemed that some sharp intelligence allowed the girl to see the essence of things hidden behind any phenomenon.</t3017> <t3018>According to Colonel Aureliano Buendía, Remedios the Beauty was not intellectually slow as people often thought, but quite the opposite.</t3018> <t3019>"It's as if she has just returned after twenty years of battling in a war," he often said.</t3019> <t3020>For her part, Úrsula thanked God for rewarding their family with an extremely pure girl, but at the same time, she worried about her beauty, considering it a supernatural force full of contradictions, a trap of the devil lying right in the midst of pure goodness.</t3020> <t3021>Therefore, she was determined to isolate her from life, protecting her from all worldly desires, unaware that Remedios the Beauty had been immune to all human vices since she was in her mother's womb.</t3021> <t3022>She never thought that people would choose her great-granddaughter to be the queen reigning at the center of the Carnival ball.</t3022> <t3023>But Aureliano Segundo, who greatly enjoyed disguising himself as a tiger, invited Father Antonio Isabel to the house to persuade his great-grandmother that the Carnival ball was not a pagan festival but a traditional Christian celebration. In the end, though still grumbling, she had to listen to the priest and agree to let them crown her great-granddaughter as queen.</t3023>
<t3024>Rumors that Remedios Buendía would preside over the festival had spread throughout the swamp region, reaching even the most remote corners where her renowned beauty was still unknown, causing anxiety among those who until then had thought her name was a symbol of corruption.</t3024> <t3025>It was an unfounded anxiety.</t3025> <t3026>If there was anyone at that time who was no longer a cause for concern, it was Colonel Aureliano Buendía, a sad old man who was gradually losing his connection with the reality of the country.</t3026> <t3027>Secluding himself in the jewelry workshop, his only link to the outside world was the trade of little goldfish.</t3027> <t3028>One of the soldiers who had guarded the colonel's house when peace was newly established would go daily to the neighboring villages to sell goldfish and return home with gold coins and news.</t3028>
<t3029>There are rumors that the Royalist faction, with the help of the Liberal faction, has reformed the law so that each President has the right to stay in office for about a hundred years.</t3029> <t3030>There are rumors that an agreement with the Vatican has been signed, stating that a Cardinal</t3030> <t3031>Patriarch, adorned with a diamond-studded crown and riding on a golden throne, has come from Rome, and the Liberal ministers have taken photographs of the ceremony where they knelt to kiss his ring.</t3031> <t3032>There are rumors that a Spanish theater actress, during a night stay in the capital, was kidnapped by a masked group right in her bedroom, and on Sunday she danced naked at the summer house of the President of the Republic.</t3032> <t3033>"Do not talk politics with me," the colonel said to the soldier.</t3033> <t3034>"Our issue is selling goldfish."</t3034> <t3035>The rumor that the colonel did not want to know anything about the state of the country because he had become wealthy from his jewelry workshop, when it reached Úrsula's ears, made her laugh with her very sharp sense of reality. She could not understand the colonel's business of constantly exchanging goldfish for gold coins, only to then turn the gold coins back into goldfish, and so on in a perpetual cycle: having to work harder the more he sold to satisfy the hopeless vicious circle.</t3035>
<t3036>Indeed, for the colonel, what delighted him was not business but labor.</t3036> <t3037>He had to concentrate his mind intensely to arrange the scales, to inlay the tiny golden pupil into the eyes, to thin the scales in front of the fins, to attach the tail to the fish, so that there was no room in his mind for the disappointment of war to creep in.</t3037> <t3038>The meticulous and demanding profession required him to exert all his mental strength, which aged him very quickly, faster than all the arduous years of warfare combined; his working posture bent his spine, and his pupils lost their sharpness, but the intense concentration on his work rewarded him with a serene spirit.</t3038> <t3039>The last time he was seen concerned with any war-related issues was when veterans from both political parties sought his help to demand the government pass the war pension, a pension always promised but perpetually in the initial stages of processing.</t3039> <t3040>"Forget about it," he told them.</t3040> <t3041>"You see, I refused it to avoid the suffering of waiting in vain until death."</t3041> <t3042>At first, Colonel Herinendo Marquez visited him every afternoon, and they both sat at the door looking out onto the street to reminisce about their past.</t3042>
<t3043>But Amaranta suffered unbearably from the old memories stirred up by the very man whose weary head, already bald, had thrust him into the abyss of premature old age, and thus she tormented him with trivialities until he only visited on special occasions and eventually stopped coming altogether because paralysis confined him to one spot.</t3043> <t3044>Sullen, silent, and oblivious to the invigorating new breeze blowing through his house, Colonel Aureliano Buendía had come to understand that the secret to a peaceful old age was nothing other than a deep attachment to solitude.</t3044> <t3045>He woke up at five in the morning after a fitful sleep, drank the sugarless coffee that had been a constant in his life, then locked himself in his gold workshop. At four in the afternoon, he dragged his stool along the hallway without ever looking at the garden ablaze with red roses, paying no mind to Amaranta's patient determination as she followed every faint hum that marked the arrival of dusk, and then he sat at the door looking out at the street until the mosquitoes drove him inside.</t3045> <t3046>Occasionally, someone dared to disturb his solitude.</t3046>
<t3047>- How are you, Colonel? - they asked him as they passed by.</t3047>
<t3048>- Still the same, - he replied.</t3048> <t3049>- I am waiting for my own funeral to arrive.</t3049>
<t3050>Thus, the concern caused by the public reappearance of the Buendía family through the crowning of Remedios the Beauty had lost its practical basis.</t3050>
<t3051>However, many people did not believe so.</t3051> <t3052>Naive in the face of the impending disaster, the populace flocked to the grand square in an uproarious and boundless belief.</t3052> <t3053>The Carnival ball had reached its feverish peak, and Aureliano Segundo, satisfied with his tiger disguise, joyfully moved among the self-indulgent crowd, shouting and singing until his voice was hoarse.</t3053> <t3054>At that very moment, on the road leading from the swamp into the town, appeared a procession of colorfully disguised people, carrying a gilded palanquin on which sat a girl so stunningly beautiful that people dared not even think of her.</t3054>
<t3055>The gentle residents of the town of Macondo simultaneously removed their masks to get a better look at the dazzling girl in a crown adorned with emeralds and a cloak made of bird feathers, as if she were a true queen and not just a beauty queen in the masquerade ball of Carnival.</t3055> <t3056>There was no shortage of people with enough clear-headed reasoning to suspect that the group intended to provoke.</t3056> <t3057>But Aureliano Segundo immediately overcame this complicated situation, declaring that the newcomers were honored guests, and he solemnly seated Remedios the Beauty and the disguised queen together on the high platform.</t3057> <t3058>By midnight, the strangers disguised as Bedouins joined the ecstatic festivities of the night and enriched the fun with brilliant pyrotechnics and rope-walking tricks that made everyone think of the magical games of the gypsies.</t3058> <t3059>Suddenly, in the midst of the most bustling part of the celebration, someone disrupted the warm festive atmosphere.</t3059>
<t3060>- Long live the Liberal Party! - he shouted. - Long live Colonel Aureliano Buendía!</t3060>
<t3061>The bursts of gunfire extinguished the brilliant, multicolored lights of the fireworks, the terrified screams stifled the lively music, and fear dispelled the joy.</t3061>
<t3062>Many years later, public opinion continued to assert that the royal guards protecting the queen were disguised as a platoon of regular soldiers who had hidden conventional weapons beneath the beautiful attire of the Bedouins. In a special communiqué, the government opposed this public opinion and promised to conduct a thorough investigation into this bloodshed.</t3062> <t3063>But the truth was never clarified, and the explanation that the royal guards showed no signs of provocation, acted under the commander's orders, and mercilessly fired into the crowd persisted indefinitely.</t3063> <t3064>When order was restored, there was no trace of any disguised Bedouins in the entire town; the square was left with the wounded and the dead, including three clowns, four people dressed as Columbus, seventeen emperors, one demon, three musicians, and three Japanese queens. Amid the chaotic fear, José Arcadio Segundo managed to save Remedios the Beauty, and Aureliano Segundo managed to embrace the girl disguised as the queen, with disheveled clothes and a blood-soaked feathered cloak, to escape.</t3064> <t3065>The girl's name was Fernanda del Carpio. She had been chosen from among five thousand of the most beautiful girls in the country and brought to Macondo with the promise that she would be crowned queen of Madagascar.</t3065> <t3066>Úrsula cared for her as if she were her own daughter.</t3066> <t3067>The villagers, instead of doubting her innocence, pitied her genuine virtues.</t3067> <t3068>Six months after the massacre, when the wounded had fully recovered and the last flowers placed on the communal grave had withered, Aureliano Segundo went to find her in a distant city where she was living with her father, and then married her in the town of Macondo in a noisy celebration that lasted twenty days.</t3068>
<t3069>Chapter 11</t3069>
<t3070>After two months, the couple almost divorced because Auréliano Segundo took a portrait of Petra Cotes dressed as the queen of Madagascar to comfort her.</t3070> <t3071>When she found out, Fernanda packed her bridal clothes and left Macondo without saying a word to him.</t3071> <t3072>Auréliano Segundo caught up with her on the marshy road.</t3072> <t3073>After begging and promising to reform, he managed to bring her back home and stopped visiting his mistress.</t3073>
<t3074>Petra Cotes believed in her own allure, completely unperturbed.</t3074> <t3075>She had made him into a man.</t3075> <t3076>From the time he was just a young boy, filled with fanciful thoughts and completely ignorant of life, she had pulled him out of Melquiades' room and given him a place in the real world.</t3076> <t3077>Nature had endowed him with a quiet and proud disposition, prone to solitary contemplation, but she had forged in him a spirited, strong, open, and extravagant character, instilling in him the joy of life, the joy of festivities and spending; thus transforming him from soul to outward appearance into the man she had dreamed of when she was a young girl.</t3077> <t3078>He had married because, like children, sooner or later they must marry.</t3078> <t3079>He did not dare to tell her the news early.</t3079> <t3080>He tried to maintain an innocent demeanor, whether by getting angry without reason or pretending to be sorrowful, all in an effort to make Petra Cotes the one responsible for their separation.</t3080> <t3081>One day, Aureliano Segundo scolded her unreasonably.</t3081> <t3082>Understanding his scheme immediately, she bluntly confronted him:</t3082>
<t3083>- It's just that you want to marry that beauty queen.</t3083>
<t3084>Aureliano Segundo, very embarrassed, pretended to be angry for a while, loudly proclaiming that he had been misunderstood and humiliated, and from then on, he no longer associated with her.</t3084> <t3085>Always in control of herself, with an extraordinary self-discipline, Petra Cotes listened to the music and the wedding fireworks, listened to the noise and the frenzy of the communal celebration, as if all of it were just another one of Aureliano Segundo's tricks.</t3085> <t3086>To those who showed pity for her fate, she reassured them with a smile: "Don't worry," she told them, "That beauty queen is just someone I use for errands."</t3086> <t3087>To the neighbor who brought her pairs of candles to illuminate the portrait of the lover who had abandoned her, she spoke with a mysterious certainty:</t3087>
<t3088>- The only candle that will bring him back will always burn brightly.</t3088>
<t3089>As she had foreseen, Aureliano Segundo returned to her house right after the honeymoon ended.</t3089> <t3090>He brought along his old friends and a photographer carrying the clothes and feathered cloak that Fernanda had worn at the Carnival ball.</t3090> <t3091>In the festive atmosphere that lasted all afternoon, he dressed Petra Cotes in queenly attire, crowned her as the queen of Madagascar, took photos, and distributed her portraits to his friends.</t3091> <t3092>She not only played along with the game but also felt pity for him, thinking that he must have been very desperate to come up with such a strange way to make amends.</t3092> <t3093>At seven in the evening, still wearing the queenly attire, she received him in bed.</t3093> <t3094>He had been married for only a few months, but she immediately noticed that the couple was not getting along even in their marital bed, and she was ecstatic to see her revenge fully realized.</t3094> <t3095>However, two days later, when he not only did not dare to return to her house but also sent an intermediary to settle the terms of their separation, she understood that she would need to be more patient and that he seemed determined to pursue that superficial glitter.</t3095> <t3096>She was not upset.</t3096> <t3097>She complied with all his demands, making everyone genuinely believe that she was a suffering woman.</t3097> <t3098>The only memento of Aureliano Segundo she kept was a pair of beige boots, which, according to him, he would wear when he was laid to rest in his coffin.</t3098> <t3099>She wrapped them in cloth and hid them carefully at the bottom of a chest, then waited, waited with great hope.</t3099>
<t3100>- Sooner or later, he will have to come back, - she said to herself, - even if it's just to get these boots.</t3100>
<t3101>She did not have to wait as long as she had previously predicted.</t3101> <t3102>In fact, Aureliano Segundo, right from the wedding night, understood that he would return to Petra Cotes' house much sooner than he would need to wear the beige boots, because Fernanda was a woman out of place in this life.</t3102> <t3103>She was born and raised in a place thousands of kilometers away from the sea, a desolate city with fearful nights echoing the clattering wheels of viceroys on the rough stone streets.</t3103> <t3104>Thirty-two bell towers tolled mournfully and deathly at six o'clock in the evening.</t3104> <t3105>The sun never shone on the old stone-paved house.</t3105> <t3106>The wind died on the tops of the cypress trees in the yard, on the faded wind screens in the rooms, on the intersecting arches of the camphor trees in the garden.</t3106> <t3107>Even when she reached puberty, Fernanda knew nothing of life beyond the melancholic, longing piano practice pieces played by someone permitted to skip the afternoon nap next door.</t3107> <t3108>Sitting in her sickly, pale mother's room in the filtered light through dusty frosted glass; she listened to the orderly, mournful, and sorrowful notes and thought that music existed in life, while she busily braided mourning hats from palm leaves.</t3108> <t3109>Her mother, sweating with fever at five in the afternoon, told her stories of past glories.</t3109> <t3110>One moonlit night, when she was still a child, Fernanda saw the shadow of a woman in white walking from the flower garden into the prayer room.</t3110> <t3111>The shadow that passed by so quickly worried her because she felt it looked exactly like her, as if it were her own shadow twenty years later. "That was your great-great-grandmother," her mother said as her cough subsided, "She died of a chill while cutting a camphor branch."</t3111> <t3112>Many years later, when she felt she looked exactly like her great-great-grandmother, Fernanda began to doubt the ghost she had seen as a child, but her mother scolded her for her lack of faith.</t3112>
<t3113>- We are inherently wealthy and incredibly powerful, she said to her.</t3113> <t3114>- Then you will be a queen.</t3114>
<t3115>She believed that even though her family currently owned only a long dining table with enough cloth and silverware, and this table was only used for eating pastries and drinking chocolate.</t3115> <t3116>Even on her wedding day, she still dreamed of the time of kings.</t3116> <t3117>This legend persisted even though her father, Don Fernando, had to mortgage the house to get money for her wedding attire.</t3117> <t3118>Not too naive nor pretentious about her family's prestige, she was raised in such a manner.</t3118> <t3119>From the time she had a little understanding, she remembered sitting on a golden chamber pot engraved with her family's coat of arms to relieve herself.</t3119> <t3120>The first time she left the house was when she was twelve years old, in a carriage that only needed to travel two blocks to reach the convent.</t3120>
<t3121>The classmates were all surprised that she was separated, made to sit on a very high chair, and that even during playtime she did not play with them.</t3121><t3122>"She is very different," the nuns explained to them, "She will be a queen."</t3122><t3123>Her friends believed it because even then she was already a beautiful, unusual, and discreet girl.</t3123><t3124>Eight years later, after learning to write poetry in Latin, to play the clavichord, to converse with young noblemen about falconry, with bishops about theological matters, to debate with foreign diplomats about state affairs, and with the Pope about matters of God, she returned to her parents' home to weave mourning hats from palm leaves.</t3124><t3125>She found her home cleared of furniture.</t3125><t3126>Almost only valueless beds and wardrobes, chandeliers, and the silverware remained, because the valuable items had been gradually sold off to cover the costs of her education.</t3126><t3127>Her mother had passed away from a fever at five in the afternoon.</t3127><t3128>Her father, Don Fernando, dressed in black, with a high-collared shirt and a gold chain draped across his chest, would give her a silver coin for food expenses on Mondays, then take away the mourning hats made of palm leaves that she had finished the previous week.</t3128><t3129>He spent most of the day in his private room, and on the rare occasions he went out, he hurried back home before six in the evening to pray the Rosary with her. He never befriended anyone.</t3129><t3130>He never spoke of the civil wars that were ravaging the country.</t3130><t3131>He never missed her piano practice sessions at three in the afternoon.</t3131><t3132>When she began to lose hope of becoming a queen, there was an urgent knock on the main door. She quickly opened it to a handsome soldier with a scar on his cheek and a gold medal pinned to his chest. He went to have a private conversation with her father.</t3132><t3133>Two hours later, her father came to the sewing room to find her.</t3133><t3134>"Prepare your belongings," he told her, "You need to go far away."</t3134><t3135>That is how she was taken to Macondo.</t3135><t3136>In just one day, life had brought down upon her all the weight of a reality that in</t3136>
<t3137>For many years, her parents deliberately shielded her.</t3137><t3138>Since returning home, she locked herself in her room, crying, ignoring the pleas and explanations of Don Fernanda, to erase the burning shame that had scarred her skin.</t3138><t3139>She had just vowed to herself that she would not leave her room until she died when Aureliano Segundo came to the house looking for her.</t3139><t3140>It was an unforeseen stroke of luck because, in her confusion and anger, in her fury and shame, she had lied to him so he would never trace her true whereabouts.</t3140><t3141>But the only tangible clue for Aureliano Segundo to follow in his search for her was her unmistakable plains accent and her craft of weaving mourning hats from palm leaves.</t3141><t3142>He patiently searched for her with the same determination that José Arcadio Buendía had used to cross the mountains and found Macondo, with the blind pride that Colonel Aureliano Buendía had used to ignite futile wars, with the mad perseverance that Úrsula had used to assert the endurance of her lineage.</t3142><t3143>That was how Aureliano Segundo searched for Fernanda, never showing any sign of discouragement.</t3143><t3144>When he asked where mourning hats woven from palm leaves were sold, people led him to their homes to choose the finest hats.</t3144><t3145>When he asked where the most beautiful girl on earth was, mothers immediately took him to see their daughters.</t3145><t3146>He got lost in cloud-covered mountain passes, in forgotten regions, and in the maze of despair.</t3146><t3147>He crossed a withered plateau where only the echo of his thoughts and the blinding thirst accompanied him.</t3147><t3148>After many weeks of hardship, he reached a strange city where all the church bells tolled mournfully.</t3148><t3149>Though he had never seen it before, nor heard it described, he immediately recognized the weathered walls eroded by salty winds, the rickety wooden balconies eaten away by termites, and the sign advertising mourning hats, with its letters faded on an old cardboard.</t3149><t3150>From the moment he arrived until the morning Fernanda left the house in the care of the Almighty Virgin, they were so busy that there was hardly enough time for the nuns to sew the bridal gown.</t3150><t3151>They were preoccupied with packing chandeliers, silverware, and countless useless items from the noble family that had been bankrupt for two centuries into six large trunks. Don Fernanda declined the invitation to accompany them.</t3151><t3152>He promised to go once he had fulfilled his promises.</t3152><t3153>From the moment he bowed to bless his daughter, he closed himself off again in his room, writing letters in verse adorned with sorrowful decorations and the family crest, which were the only means through which Fernanda and her father had direct contact with the outside world.</t3153><t3154>For Fernanda, that day was her true birthday.</t3154><t3155>For Aureliano Segundo, that day was both the beginning and the end of his happiness.</t3155>
<t3156>Fernanda carried with her a precious calendar and a bunch of gold-plated keys in which the priest who taught her had marked with ever-fresh ink the days to abstain from entering the room.</t3156> <t3157>Excluding Holy Week, Sundays, days required to attend mass, the first Fridays of each month, feast days, and menstruation days, which were strictly to be abstained from, her useful calendar only had forty-two free days scattered within the web of still fresh ink crosses.</t3157> <t3158>Aureliano Segundo believed that time would break down that barrier and extended the wedding celebration beyond the set time.</t3158> <t3159>Exhausted from having to pour out bottles of Brandy and champagne into the trash to keep the house tidy, and at the same time curious to see that the bride and groom did not go to bed at the same time and even slept in separate rooms while fireworks were still going off, music was still playing, and livestock was still being slaughtered, Úrsula recalled her own life experiences and wondered if Fernanda was also wearing a chastity belt that sooner or later would provoke the villagers' malicious comments and be the source of a tragedy.</t3159>
<t3160>But Fernanda had confessed to the old man that she only had to wait two weeks before being allowed to sleep with her husband for the first time.</t3160> <t3161>Indeed, two weeks passed, and she opened her room door with the obligatory concession of a punished victim, and Aureliano Segundo saw the most beautiful woman in the world with eyes blazing with the pride of a frightened animal and locks of copper-colored blonde hair spread over the pillow.</t3161> <t3162>He was so delighted by that sight that it took him a moment to realize that Fernanda was wearing a pure white nightgown, covering her ankles and even her knuckles, with a large, round opening at the belly, carefully embroidered around the edges.</t3162> <t3163>Aureliano Segundo couldn't hold back a burst of hearty laughter.</t3163>
<t3164>- Oh, this is even more provocative than the scenes you've ever seen - he yelled, with a cackling laugh echoing through the house.</t3164> <t3165>- You married a nun from the Saint Vincent de Paul order.</t3165>
<t3166>A month later, unable to persuade his wife to take off that nightgown, he went to Petra Cotes's house to take a picture of her wearing the queen's attire.</t3166> <t3167>After that, when he managed to convince Fernanda not to return to her hometown and to come back to their home, she conceded to his earnest pleas for reconciliation, but he still didn't know how to arrange their rest as he had dreamed when he came to the city of thirty-two bell towers to find her.</t3167> <t3168>Aureliano Segundo only found in her a sense of disillusionment.</t3168> <t3169>One night, a few days before giving birth to their first son, Fernanda knew that her husband had secretly gone back to share a bed with Petra Cotes.</t3169>
<t3170>- That's right, - he admitted.</t3170> <t3171>Then, in a conciliatory tone, he explained: - I needed to act that way so that our herd could continue to grow and multiply even more.</t3171>
<t3172>He did not take much time to convince her about that strange measure, but once he had persuaded her with seemingly irrefutable evidence, the only condition that Fernanda forced him to promise was not to let death catch him right on the bed of his lover.</t3172> <t3173>The three of them lived together like that, without anyone mentioning anything to anyone.</t3173> <t3174>Aureliano Segundo was affectionate and punctual with both, Petra Cotes was satisfied with the harmony, while Fernanda pretended not to know the truth.</t3174>
<t3175>However, harmony was not achieved within the family: Fernanda did not live harmoniously with everyone.</t3175> <t3176>Úrsula tried hard to scold her into throwing away the felt cloth she used to line the bed whenever she was with her husband and then draped over her shoulders, which caused much gossip among the villagers, but she still refused to throw it away.</t3176> <t3177>She could not persuade her to use the toilet when she needed to relieve herself and to sell the golden chamber pot to Colonel Aureliano Buendía so he could make goldfish.</t3177> <t3178>Amaranta was annoyed by her rude speech and habit of calling things by the wrong names, so she often used slang in front of her.</t3178>
<t3179>One day, infuriated by the blasphemy, Fernanda wanted to know what Amaranta was saying, and without using any flowery language, she replied:</t3179>
<t3180>- He said, - she said, - that you are one of those girls who carry shrimp on their heads with dung.</t3180>
<t3181>Since that day, the two people did not speak to each other.</t3181> <t3182>When they were forced to talk to each other, they would send messages through others or speak indirectly.</t3182> <t3183>Ignoring the discomfort of the household, Fernanda did not give up her intention to impose habits on her superiors.</t3183> <t3184>She decided to abandon the practice of eating in the kitchen whenever one was hungry, as was done before, and required everyone to eat at the designated time in the dining room, sitting at a large, neatly arranged table with napkins, chandeliers, and silverware.</t3184> <t3185>The solemnity of what Ursula considered the simplest daily activity created a tense atmosphere, causing José Arcadio Segundo, who was already sullen, to be the first to oppose it.</t3185> <t3186>But the habits were still established, such as the custom of praying the Rosary before dinner, which caught the neighbors' attention and led to rumors that the Buendía family did not sit down to eat like other families but instead turned dinner into a solemn mass.</t3186> <t3187>Even Ursula's religious beliefs, which arose more from momentary hope than tradition, began to conflict with the doctrines Fernanda had inherited from her parents.</t3187> <t3188>While Ursula was still strong and capable, some old customs were maintained, and family life followed her subtle perceptions. But when she became blind and the weight of old age confined her to a corner, the reins that Fernanda had initiated since she first came to the house completely tightened, and no one but her decided the family's fate.</t3188> <t3189>The candy-making trade that Santa</t3189> <t3190>Sofía de la Piedad maintained according to Ursula's wishes was deemed lowly by Fernanda and was soon discontinued.</t3190> <t3191>The house, which had been open from early morning until bedtime, was closed during the afternoon nap with the excuse of keeping the bedrooms cool and then remained shut all day.</t3191> <t3192>The aloe branch and cake that had been hung at the door since the founding of Macondo were replaced by a niche for a statue of Jesus.</t3192> <t3193>Colonel Aureliano Buendía also noticed these changes and understood their reasons.</t3193> <t3194>"We are returning to being aristocrats," he protested, "At this rate, we will once again have to fight against the monarchy, but this time to put another king on the throne."</t3194> <t3195>Fernanda, being very delicate, restrained herself to avoid clashing with him.</t3195> <t3196>His free spirit and resistance to rigid social rituals made her very uncomfortable.</t3196> <t3197>The unsweetened coffee at five in the morning, the clutter in the workshop, the frayed coat, and the habit of sitting at the door looking out at dusk were all like painful thorns in her eyes.</t3197> <t3198>But Fernanda had to yield to him, treating him as an external part of the family machinery because she understood very clearly that this old colonel, tamed by age and disappointment, could, with a single powerful act of rebellion, shake the very foundations of the house.</t3198> <t3199>When her husband decided to name their first son after his grandfather, she did not dare to object, as she had only been married for a year.</t3199> <t3200>But when their first daughter was born, she insisted on naming her Renata, after her mother.</t3200> <t3201>Ursula decided to name her Remedios.</t3201> <t3202>After a heated debate in which Aureliano Segundo played the role of a cheerful sage, they named her Renata</t3202> <t3203>Remedios, but Fernanda continued to call her Renata mockingly, while the whole family and the villagers called her Meme, a nickname for Remedios.</t3203>
<t3204>At first, Fernanda did not talk about her family, but gradually she began to idealize her father.</t3204><t3205>Right at the dining table, she praised him as a special person who had renounced all empty rituals and had become a living saint.</t3205><t3206>Aureliano Segundo, surprised by the untimely praise of his father-in-law, couldn't help but mock lightly behind his wife's back.</t3206><t3207>The whole family followed his example.</t3207><t3208>Even Úrsula, who was extremely proud of her harmonious family and quietly endured the household's discord, once said that her little great-grandson would surely become a Cardinal.</t3208><t3209>A Cardinal because he was "the grandson of a saint, the son of a queen, and a cattle thief."</t3209><t3210>Despite that mocking smile, the children were used to thinking of their grandfather as a legendary figure who often sent them affectionate poems in letters and a huge box of gifts every Christmas that almost couldn't fit through the main door.</t3210><t3211>In fact, these were the last trinkets left from the old noble estate.</t3211><t3212>Right in the children's bedroom, with these items, an altar was set up with life-sized statues of saints whose glass eyes made a deep impression on them as if they were real; and the beautifully embroidered clothes of the saints were, in their eyes, the finest garments no one in Macondo had ever worn.</t3212><t3213>Gradually, the dull splendor of that old and cold house was transferred to the bright house of the Buendía family.</t3213><t3214>"Now, they have sent us a family cemetery," Aureliano Segundo once commented, "all that's missing are the weeping willows and the tombstones."</t3214><t3215>Although these boxes never contained toys for the children, they still eagerly awaited the end of the year for December to come, because regardless, those ancient and always unexpected items were still a novelty in the house.</t3215>
<t3216>On the tenth Christmas since Fernanda came to her husband's house, when young José Arcadio was preparing for his exams, a huge wooden chest from her grandfather, carefully nailed and varnished, was sent to Mrs. Fernanda del Carpio de Buendía, with a very respectful note written in familiar Gothic script, arriving much earlier than usual.</t3216> <t3217>While she was in her room reading the letter, the children impatiently opened the chest.</t3217> <t3218>As usual, with the help of Aureliano Segundo, they pried off the sealed wax, opened the lid of the chest, removed all the sawdust inside, and found another lead chest inside, securely fastened with brass screws.</t3218> <t3219>In front of the eager children, Aureliano Segundo unscrewed the eight brass screws, and when he opened the lid, he almost didn't have time to shout and push the children aside, because he saw Uncle Fernando dressed in black, with a cross on his chest, his skin cracked open with festering sores emitting a foul odor, and this corpse had been preserved in a broth of pearl-bearing oysters simmering over a low fire.</t3219>
<t3220>Shortly after the birth of the baby girl, the much-unanticipated celebration of Colonel Aureliano Buendía's longevity was publicly announced.</t3220> <t3221>The government ordered it to be organized to commemorate the signing of the Treaty of Neclandia.</t3221> <t3222>It was a decision so contrary to the orthodox political line that the colonel vehemently declared his opposition and refused the celebration.</t3222> <t3223>"This is the first time I've heard of a longevity celebration," he said, "But whatever it means, it can only be a blasphemy."</t3223> <t3224>The jewelry workshop, already cramped, was now crowded with emissaries.</t3224> <t3225>The lawyers dressed in dark clothes, who previously hovered around the colonel like crows, returned now looking much older and more solemn.</t3225> <t3226>Seeing them appear as they had before to prevent the war, he could not stand their overly blatant flattery.</t3226> <t3227>He ordered them to leave him alone, refusing to acknowledge himself as a national figure, as they said, but merely as an ordinary craftsman with the sole desire to die of exhaustion in oblivion and poverty, making his little gold fishes.</t3227> <t3228>What infuriated him the most was the news that the President of the Republic himself intended to personally participate in the public activities in Macondo to award the Medal of Merit to the colonel.</t3228>
<t3229>Colonel Aureliano Buendía had asked to convey to the President, word for word, that he sincerely longed for this belated but precious opportunity to shoot the President, not to make him atone for the injustices and untimeliness of the regime, but to make him atone for the insolence he dared to show towards an old man who had harmed no one.</t3229> <t3230>That was the stern warning the colonel had spoken aloud, causing the President of the Republic to postpone his trip at the last moment and, to make the celebration more grandiose, he sent a special envoy in his place.</t3230> <t3231>Colonel Gerineldo Márquez, completely bedridden, left his paralyzed bed to comfort his old comrade-in-arms.</t3231> <t3232>When he saw a rocking chair being carried by four men, and saw his friend who had shared with him all the glories and humiliations since their youth sitting on it among the pillows, Colonel Aureliano Buendía immediately realized that Colonel Gerineldo Márquez had made an effort to come and show his solidarity.</t3232> <t3233>But when he learned the true intention of this visit, he ordered his old friend to be expelled from the gold workshop.</t3233>
<t3234>- It's truly too late for me to realize, - he said to his friend, - that if I had let them shoot you, I would have done you a great favor.</t3234>
<t3235>Thus, the grand celebration of the colonel's birthday proceeded without the participation of any member of the Buendía family.</t3235> <t3236>This celebration coincidentally overlapped with the Carnival masquerade week, but no one could dissuade Colonel Aureliano Buendía from the persistent thought that this coincidence had been premeditated by the government to make the blasphemy even more egregious.</t3236> <t3237>From the silent jewelry workshop, he heard the majestic marches, the twenty-one gun salutes, the hymns of thanksgiving ringing out, and a few lines from the speech delivered in front of his house when they named a street after him.</t3237> <t3238>When his eyes welled up with tears, tears of humiliation, tears of anger, and for the first time since his defeat, he felt the agony of no longer having the indomitable spirit and the mountain-moving strength of his youth to launch a bloody battle to eradicate the monarchy.</t3238> <t3239>Amidst the lingering joyous noises of the festival, Úrsula knocked on the door of the jewelry workshop.</t3239>
<t3240>- Don't bother me anymore, - he said.</t3240> <t3241>- I am busy.</t3241>
<t3242>- Open the door quickly, - with his usual voice, the old man demanded. - This has nothing to do with the festival.</t3242>
<t3243>So Colonel Aureliano Buendía unlocked the door and saw in front of him seventeen men who were completely different from each other in stature and skin color, but all of whom bore a loneliness that made it possible for anyone, anywhere in the world, to recognize them as brothers.</t3243><t3244>They were his sons.</t3244><t3245>Without having informed each other, and without knowing each other, they had come from the most remote corners of the bustling coastal region.</t3245><t3246>All of them proudly bore the name Aureliano along with their mother's surname.</t3246><t3247>During the three days they stayed at the colonel's house, to please Úrsula and astonish Fernanda, they sometimes caused brawls.</t3247><t3248>Amaranta searched through old papers to find the notebook in which Úrsula had recorded by hand the names, birth dates, and christening dates of all of them, and she showed each one their current room.</t3248><t3249>That list allowed them to recall twenty years of war.</t3249><t3250>With that list, one could reconstruct the colonel's nocturnal journeys, from the morning he left the village of Macondo leading twenty-one young men to join a quixotic uprising, to the last time he returned, cloaked in a coat stained with dried blood.</t3250><t3251>Aureliano Segundo did not miss the chance to celebrate his uncles with a noisy party featuring champagne and accordions, and the revelry was so lively that it was considered even better than the Carnival ball that had failed because it coincided with the colonel's birthday celebration organized by the government.</t3251><t3252>They broke half the cups and trampled the flower gardens chasing a calf.</t3252><t3253>They shot guns to kill chickens, made Amaranta dance Pietro Crespi's sad waltzes, coaxed Remedios the Beauty into wearing men's pants to climb a greased pole, and then released a greased pig in the hallway, which knocked Fernanda over.</t3253><t3254>But no one complained about these excessive pranks because the house shook like an earthquake with the joy that released the robust vitality of the people.</t3254><t3255>Colonel Aureliano Buendía, who had initially received them with indifference and even suspected that some were not his blood relatives, joined in their exuberant joy and, before they left, gave each one a goldfish.</t3255><t3256>Even José Arcadio Segundo, usually cynical, offered them an afternoon of cockfighting that almost ended in disaster because some of the seventeen Aureliano brothers were experts in cockfighting and immediately recognized the cunning tricks of Father Antonio Isabel.</t3256><t3257>Aureliano Segundo, watching his brothers enthusiastically engage in endless and fascinating games, decided to invite everyone to stay and work with him.</t3257><t3258>The only one who accepted the invitation was Aureliano Triste, a robust young mulatto who had inherited his grandfather's fervor and curiosity, having experienced all sorts of hardships everywhere, and thus believed that living anywhere was the same.</t3258><t3259>The others, although still unmarried, had already determined their own destinies.</t3259><t3260>All were skilled craftsmen, pillars of their families, and good-natured people.</t3260><t3261>On Ash Wednesday, before each went their separate ways along the coast, Amaranta insisted they wear their Sunday best and take her to church.</t3261><t3262>More amused than devout, they allowed themselves to be drawn into the ceremony of confirmation.</t3262><t3263>It was here that Father Antonio Isabel marked a cross of ashes on each of their foreheads.</t3263><t3264>Back home, the youngest, wanting to wipe his forehead, discovered that the ash mark could not be washed off, and soon after, he realized that his brothers' ash marks were also indelible.</t3264><t3265>They tried soap and water, then dirt and scrubbing paste, then pumice stone and lye, but nothing could erase the cross on their foreheads.</t3265><t3266>In contrast, Amaranta and the others who attended mass easily wiped off their crosses.</t3266><t3267>"It's better that they leave like this," Úrsula said, "From now on, no one can mistake them."</t3267><t3268>They left noisily amid fireworks and music, leaving the impression that the Buendía family had sown its seed everywhere for eternity.</t3268><t3269>Aureliano Triste, with the gray ash cross on his forehead, established an ice factory on the outskirts of the village, fulfilling José Arcadio Buendía's long-held dream in his creative fervor.</t3269>
<t3270>After staying for a few months, meaning when he had become a familiar person and was respected by everyone, Aureliano Triste went looking for a house to bring his mother and unmarried sister (who was not the daughter of the colonel) to live with him, and he liked the old, seemingly abandoned house on the street near the square.</t3270> <t3271>He asked who the owner of that house was.</t3271> <t3272>Someone told him that it was an ownerless house, that previously a lonely widow who lived by eating dirt and wall lime had lived in that house, and that in the last years of her life, she was seen only twice going out, wearing a hat adorned with many tiny fake flowers and old silver shoes, as she crossed the square to the post office to send letters to the Bishop.</t3272> <t3273>People told him that her only friend was a very cruel maid who often killed dogs, cats, and any animal that dared to come near the house, then threw their bodies in the middle of the main road, causing the whole village to suffocate from the stench of the rotting animal carcasses.</t3273> <t3274>Since the time the sun dried the skin of the last animal thrown into the middle of the main road, a very long time had passed, to the extent that the whole village agreed that the mistress and the maid had died long before the war ended, and said that the house was still standing because in recent years there had been no storms or harsh winters, the door hinges were all rusted; the doors were almost standing still thanks to the cobwebs, the windows held together by moisture; the floor cracked due to the overgrown grass and wildflowers, and these cracks were home to lizards and all kinds of disgusting creatures, all of which seemed to collectively suggest that no one had lived in that house for at least half a century.</t3274> <t3275>Aureliano Triste, who liked adventure, needed no further evidence.</t3275> <t3276>He gently pushed the main door with his shoulder, and the termite-ridden wooden frame suddenly collapsed without a sound in a shower of dust and termite droppings.</t3276> <t3277>Aureliano Triste stood still at the doorstep, waiting until the thick cloud of dust had settled, and immediately he saw in the middle of the living room a gaunt woman, still dressed in the fashion of the previous century, with a few tufts of reddish hair still clinging to her bald head, her large eyes, which had just lost their hopeful gleam, still beautiful, and her face wrinkled with bitter loneliness.</t3277> <t3278>Still shocked by the sight of a person who belonged to another world, Aureliano Triste had not yet realized that the woman was aiming an old revolver at him.</t3278>
<t3279>- Please forgive me, - he said softly.</t3279>
<t3280>She stood still right in the middle of the dusty living room, intently observing the large man with a square back, a gray cross tattooed on his forehead, and through this thick dust she saw him again in a mist from another time, slinging a double-barreled shotgun across his chest and carrying a string of rabbits in his hand.</t3280>
<t3281>- Oh my God?</t3281> <t3282>For the love of God, - she whispered, - could it be that you are now returning to me with this memory?</t3282>
<t3283>- Madam, I would like to rent this house, - said Aureliano Triste.</t3283>
<t3284>So the woman raised the gun, aimed straight at the ash-colored cross on his forehead, and then resolutely cocked it.</t3284>
<t3285>- Get out immediately! - she ordered.</t3285>
<t3286>That night, during dinner, Aureliano Triste recounted this story to the whole family, and Úrsula burst into tears. "Oh my God?", she exclaimed, holding her head in her hands, "Is he still alive?".</t3286>
<t3287>Time, war, and countless everyday misfortunes had caused the old woman to completely forget Rebecca.</t3287> <t3288>The only person who was always aware that Rebecca was still alive was the old and stubborn Amaranta.</t3288> <t3289>Amaranta thought of Rebecca at dawn when the chill in her heart woke her on her lonely bed, then thought of Rebecca as she soaped her withered breasts and wrinkled belly, as she put on her old-age undergarments, and as she replaced the black bandage on the hand she had plunged into a stove full of glowing coals to punish herself.</t3289>
<t3290>Amaranta thought of Rebeca at all hours, whether asleep or awake, whether happy or sad, because loneliness had forced her to choose memories, to discard the heaps of sorrowful rubbish of life that had accumulated in her heart, and on the other hand, to purify, elevate, and eternalize other memories, the most bitter memories of her life.</t3290><t3291>Through her, Remedios the Beauty learned of Rebeca's existence.</t3291><t3292>Every time they passed the dilapidated house, she would tell her niece about a boring event or a vulgar fable, and through this form, she tried to make her niece share in her cooled hatred and thus tried to prolong it until death.</t3292><t3293>But she did not achieve her goals, because Remedios the Beauty was completely innocent of all easily moved emotions and moreover indifferent to feelings that were too distant for her.</t3293><t3294>In contrast, Úrsula, who had endured torments different from those of Amaranta, remembered Rebeca with a purer memory, because the image of a poor little girl brought to the house along with the shoes of her deceased parents had overcome the punishment she had inflicted to not recognize her as a member of the family.</t3294><t3295>Aureliano Segundo decided that he needed to bring her back home to take care of her, but his good intentions were thwarted by Rebeca's stubbornness, who had traded many years of suffering and poverty to claim the right to enjoy solitude, and was not willing to give it up for the sake of a joyful old age amidst the artificial pleasures of a daily miserable life.</t3295>
<t3296>In February, when the sixteen sons of Colonel Aureliano Buendía returned home and during the lively celebration, Aureliano Triste told them about Rebeca, and in just half a day, they restored the appearance of the house, replaced the doors and windows, whitewashed the front wall, reinforced the other walls, and cemented the floor.</t3296> <t3297>They did all the work in the outer house but were not allowed to make any repairs in the inner house.</t3297> <t3298>Rebeca did not show her face at the door.</t3298> <t3299>She let them finish the noisy renovation work, then calculated the cost and told Argenida, the old maid who still lived with her, to bring them a handful of money, the kind that had been banned from circulation since the last war, but Rebeca stubbornly believed it was still usable.</t3299> <t3300>That was when she realized how far her estrangement from real life had gone, and she understood that as long as she had a breath left, it would be difficult to separate herself from the stubborn self-imprisonment in this lonely house.</t3300>
<t3301>During the second visit to Macondo by Colonel Aureliano Buendía's sons, one of them stayed to work with Aureliano Triste.</t3301> <t3302>His name was Aureliano Segundo.</t3302> <t3303>He was one of the first to come to the house to be named.</t3303> <t3304>Úrsula and Amaranta recognized him immediately because within a few hours, he had broken countless fragile items just by touching them.</t3304> <t3305>Time had reduced the initial growth of his body, and now he was of average stature, covered in smallpox scars, but his ability to break things remained the same.</t3305> <t3306>Many dishes were broken, even before he touched them.</t3306> <t3307>Fernanda had to quickly buy him a set of alloy dishes so he wouldn't break her expensive porcelain ones.</t3307> <t3308>Even these metal dishes were chipped and bent within a few days.</t3308> <t3309>But aside from this incurable habit of breaking dishes, he was so sincere that he was immediately loved and trusted by everyone, and he was a very hard worker.</t3309> <t3310>In a short time, through his own efforts, he made the ice production exceed the local market demand.</t3310> <t3311>As a result, Aureliano Triste considered the possibility of expanding the ice business to other villages in the swamp region.</t3311> <t3312>That was when he conceived the decisive turning point that not only meant modernizing his factory but also connecting Macondo with the rest of the world.</t3312>
<t3313>- We need to extend the railway line all the way here, - he said.</t3313>
<t3314>It was the first time that the word was heard in Macondo.</t3314> <t3315>Standing before the drawing made by Aureliano Triste, which was a direct descendant of the diagrams that José Arcadio Buendía had illustrated for the plan to use solar energy in warfare, Úrsula reaffirmed her feeling that time was circling back.</t3315> <t3316>But unlike his grandfather, Aureliano Triste did not suffer from insomnia, did not lose his appetite, nor did he have the erratic temper that caused others distress; on the contrary, he envisioned his plans clearly, saw them as direct possibilities, made precise calculations of the costs and construction timelines, and meticulously ensured that no unfortunate gaps were left.</t3316>
<t3317>Aureliano Segundo, who seemed to have inherited a lack of foresight from his great-grandfather—a trait absent in Colonel Aureliano Buendía—recklessly spent money on building a railway, just as he had previously squandered money on his brother's failed river navigation project.</t3317> <t3318>Aureliano Triste checked the calendar and set off the following Wednesday to return after the rainy season.</t3318> <t3319>Since his departure, there had been no further news.</t3319> <t3320>Aureliano Centeno, after producing an excess of ice, began experimenting with making ice from fruit juice instead of water. Unknowingly and unintentionally, he discovered the basic principle of making ice cream. This led him to consider changing the production methods of a factory he assumed would be his, as his brother had shown no signs of returning after the rainy season and another summer had passed.</t3320> <t3321>However, at the beginning of another winter, a washerwoman by the river, during the hottest part of the day, ran across the main road, frantically shouting in a state of complete agitation:</t3321>
<t3322>- Oh my goodness! - she cried. - A terrible monster like a kitchen dragging an entire village is coming?</t3322>
<t3323>At that moment, the entire village shuddered at the sound of a long, resonant whistle and the heavy, hissing breaths of the locomotive.</t3323> <t3324>In the previous weeks, the villagers had seen work crews laying sleepers and pulling rails, but no one paid attention because they thought it was merely a new magic trick by the gypsies who had returned with trumpets and tambourines, blowing and banging to advertise the ingenious inventions of the wise men from Jerusalem.</t3324> <t3325>But once they recovered from the whistle and the hissing of the locomotive, the entire population of Macondo poured into the streets and saw Aureliano Triste waving to them from the locomotive. They eagerly watched the train adorned with flowers on its windows, arriving in Macondo for the first time after an eight-month delay.</t3325> <t3326>The innocent yellow train might bring to Macondo countless uncertainties and clarities, flattery and misfortune, upheavals, suffering, and longing.</t3326>
<t3327>Chapter 12</t3327>
<t3328>Astonished by so many marvelous inventions, the people of Macondo didn't know where to start their admiration.</t3328> <t3329>People stayed up all night watching the electric lights illuminated by the generator that Aureliano Triste brought back after his second train journey, and it took several days for them to get used to its humming sound.</t3329>
<t3330>People were outraged by the vivid images that the wealthy merchant Bruno Crespi screened at the theater with the ticket booth, because a character who had died and been buried in one film and had someone shed tears of sorrow for him, came back to life and became an Arab in another film.</t3330><t3331>The crowd, having spent two centavos to share the tribulations of the characters, could not tolerate such unprecedented deceit and left.</t3331><t3332>At Bruno Crespi's request, the mayor issued a proclamation explaining that films were a product of imagination and that the public should not be so upset.</t3332><t3333>Despite these explanations, many believed they had fallen victim to a new gypsy trick and decided not to return to the cinema, thinking they already had enough real suffering and did not need to waste their time mourning the fake misfortunes of imaginary characters.</t3333><t3334>The same happened with the phonographs that the prostitutes carried instead of the old-fashioned guitars, which at one time had severely harmed the interests of the bands.</t3334><t3335>Initially, curiosity increased the number of customers in the red-light district, to the point where even noblewomen disguised themselves as commoners to see the novelty of the phonograph firsthand.</t3335><t3336>But the more they observed, the quicker they concluded that it was not some magical trick as they had thought and as the prostitutes claimed, but merely a mechanical device that could not compare to a band, which was moving, human, and full of everyday truths.</t3336><t3337>The disillusionment was so great that when phonographs became common in every household, they were not used as entertainment for adults but were left for children to take apart and play with.</t3337><t3338>In contrast, when people witnessed the real marvel of the telephone placed outside the train station, which also had a crank and looked like a crude phonograph, even the bravest were terrified.</t3338><t3339>It seemed as if God had decided to test every capacity for wonder in humans and keep the people of Macondo in a state of oscillation between joy and sorrow, belief and doubt, to the extent that no one knew exactly where the boundary of reality lay.</t3339><t3340>It was a tangled mix of truth and illusion that made the ghost of José Arcadio Buendía restless under the chestnut tree, forcing him to pace the house even in broad daylight.</t3340><t3341>Since the official inauguration of the railroad and the regular arrival of the train at eleven o'clock every Wednesday morning, and the construction of a crude wooden station with an office containing a desk, a telephone, and a ticket booth, people in Macondo began to walk the streets trying to appear normal, though they looked like circus performers.</t3341><t3342>In a village that was well acquainted with the tricks of the gypsies, the future did not look promising for the smooth-talking medicine men who relied on the sound of a clanging pot and meals that barely saved their souls, but they profited greatly by deceiving the gullible, whether out of weariness or naivety.</t3342><t3343>Among the circus clowns in tight pants, high boots, rubber hats, and iron-rimmed glasses with brown eyes that looked like roosters, there was one who came to Macondo every Wednesday and had lunch at the Buendía house: the short, chubby, always smiling Mr. Herbert.</t3343>
<t3344>No one recognized him sitting at the dining table until he had devoured an entire bunch of bananas.</t3344> <t3345>Aureliano Segundo happened to meet him while he was still grumbling and cursing in awkward Spanish because he couldn't get a private room at the Jacob Hotel, so he brought the guest home as he often did with many other strangers.</t3345> <t3346>He had a business selling helium balloons that he took everywhere, making huge profits, but he couldn't attract customers in Macondo because the people there considered it outdated after having seen and tried the flying carpets of folklore.</t3346> <t3347>Therefore, he was going to leave on the next train.</t3347> <t3348>When the host had someone bring the first bunch of ripe bananas, which usually hung in the dining room, the guest indifferently broke off one.</t3348> <t3349>He ate while talking, nibbling and chewing noisily, more like the mannerisms of an absent-minded scholar than a glutton, and when he finished the first bunch, he asked for another.</t3349> <t3350>At that moment, he opened the toolkit he always carried with him and took out a package containing optical instruments.</t3350> <t3351>Then, with the caution of a diamond merchant, he meticulously examined the banana, cutting it into pieces with a special knife and weighing them on a precision scale, then measuring the diameter of each piece with a gunsmith's caliper.</t3351> <t3352>Next, he took out one instrument after another, one to measure temperature, another to measure humidity, and another to measure light intensity.</t3352> <t3353>It was a bizarre ritual, making everyone eat with bated breath, waiting for Mr. Herbert to say something, but he said nothing that revealed his intentions.</t3353>
<t3354>In the days that followed, people saw Mr. Herbert carrying a net and basket to catch butterflies in the areas around the town.</t3354> <t3355>By Wednesday, a group of agricultural engineers, irrigation experts, cartographers, and surveyors arrived to conduct weekly surveys in the very areas where Herbert had been catching butterflies.</t3355> <t3356>After that, Mr. Jack Brown arrived on a private railcar attached to the yellow train; it was a special car with silver-plated floors and walls, velvet-covered cushioned seats, and a roof lined with blue glass.</t3356> <t3357>Also on this special train, bustling around Mr. Jack Brown, were solemn lawyers in black robes, who once followed Colonel Aureliano Buendía everywhere.</t3357> <t3358>This made the villagers think that the agricultural engineers, irrigation experts, cartographers, and surveyors, as well as Mr. Herbert with his weather balloons and colorful butterflies, and Mr. Brown with his mobile railcar and fierce German Shepherds, seemed to signal a war.</t3358>
<t3359>However, people did not have much time to think, because the sensitive residents of Macondo had barely begun to ask each other what the hell was happening when the entire town turned into a camp of wooden houses with tin roofs, inhabited by strangers who arrived on overcrowded trains, not only sitting on the seats and floors but also on the roofs of the carriages.</t3359><t3360>This group of Gringos, who later brought along their skinny wives often dressed in thin muslin clothes and wide-brimmed fabric hats, built their own residential area on the other side of the railway, planting Panama trees along the road. Each house had iron mesh windows, white tables on the verandas, X-shaped weather vanes on the rooftops, and wide lawns around the houses where they kept chickens and turkeys.</t3360><t3361>The entire village was fenced with iron mesh, resembling a giant electrified chicken coop, and in the cool early summer months, flocks of swallows would darken the sky in the mornings.</t3361><t3362>No one knew exactly what they were looking for, or if in fact they were simply philanthropists, but they caused a tremendous disturbance, even more than the gypsies had before, although it was brief and understandable.</t3362><t3363>Endowed with abilities that once only God possessed, they changed the pattern of the rain, shortened the harvest season, and diverted the river to the other side of the village, behind the cemetery.</t3363><t3364>During that time, they also built a concrete mausoleum to replace the old grave of José Arcadio, so that the smell of gunpowder from the corpse wouldn't contaminate the water supply.</t3364><t3365>To serve the strangers without families, they transformed the small neighborhood of prostitutes into a larger and more bustling town.</t3365><t3366>Then, on one bright Wednesday, they brought in a trainload of stunningly beautiful prostitutes, flamboyant women trained with unimaginable skills, fully prepared with all sorts of cosmetics and tools to entice inexperienced and shy young men, satisfy the lustful, and entertain all kinds of people, especially the bachelors.</t3366><t3367>The Turkish quarter became more luxurious with stores for ocean-going sailors replacing the old shabby shops. Every Saturday night, it was noisy with energetic and adventurous crowds jostling around gambling tables, shooting galleries, in the alley where fortunes were told and omens interpreted, around tables laden with food and drink, and by Sunday morning, these tables lay overturned on the ground amidst a jumble of people, sometimes those dead drunk after hours of revelry, but mostly those who had fallen from being shot, stabbed, slashed, or hit with bottles in brawls.</t3367><t3368>It was indeed a very noisy and untimely invasion, to the extent that initially, people could not move around the streets filled with furniture, trunks, and the wooden planks and bamboo of those who brazenly built houses on any vacant land without asking anyone's permission, and the scandalous behavior of couples hanging hammocks haphazardly under trees and making love in broad daylight without regard for passersby.</t3368><t3369>The only quiet corner was that of the black people from the Antilles with their rickety wooden houses, and at dusk, they would sit on their porches singing mournful songs in their native language.</t3369><t3370>So many changes had occurred in such a short time, just eight months after Mr. Herbert's visit, that the long-time residents of Macondo called each other to wake up early and see their own village.</t3370>
<t3371>- Let's see what kind of devilish things we've encountered, - Colonel Aureliano Buendía often said, - don't invite the Gringos to eat our royal bananas anymore!</t3371>
<t3372>On the contrary, Aureliano Segundo was overjoyed by the influx of people from all over.</t3372><t3373>In no time, his house was filled with strange guests, world-famous diners, and thus additional bedrooms had to be built in the yard, the dining room had to be expanded, the old dining table was replaced with a new one with sixteen seats, and all the dishes and cutlery had to be new, yet they still had to arrange lunch in shifts.</t3373><t3374>Fernanda had to endure and serve the guests of all kinds as if they were royalty, those who brazenly dragged their muddy, sandy boots into the dining room, urinated all over the garden, spread out tarps anywhere to nap, and spouted all sorts of stories without regard for the embarrassment of the women or the indignation of the respectable men.</t3374><t3375>Faced with the chaos of those lower-class people, Amaranta showed her annoyance by going to eat in the kitchen as she used to.</t3375><t3376>Colonel Aureliano Buendía knew that most of those who came into his workshop to greet him did so not out of respect but out of curiosity to see a historical relic, a museum skeleton, so he decided to lock himself in all day, and rarely was he seen sitting by the door facing the street.</t3376><t3377>Úrsula was entirely different; even when she could only shuffle along, clinging to the walls, she still felt the youthful excitement whenever the train was about to arrive.</t3377><t3378>"We need to get meat and fish," she ordered the four cooks, who were always bustling about punctually under the strict supervision of Santa Sofía de la Piedad.</t3378><t3379>"We need to have everything ready," she insisted, "because you never know what the guests might want to eat."</t3379><t3380>The train arrived at the hottest hour.</t3380><t3381>At lunchtime, the house was as noisy as a market, and the sweaty diners, without knowing who the hosts were, jostled to take the best seats at the table, while the cooks hurriedly bumped into each other carrying huge pots of soup, stewed meat, vegetable broth, rice dishes, and ladling out pitcher after pitcher of lemonade until the large barrel was emptied.</t3381><t3382>The chaos was so great that Fernanda was infuriated, convinced that many people had come to eat twice, and often wanted to burst out with vulgar words because some fools thought it was an inn and asked for the bill.</t3382><t3383>It had been more than a year since Mr. Herbert's visit, and the only thing known was that the Gringos planned to plant bananas in the enchanting land that José Arcadio Buendía and his men had crossed in their quest for great discoveries.</t3383><t3384>Two other sons of Colonel Aureliano Buendía, marked with crosses on their foreheads, also came, drawn by the boom, and they explained their decision with a phrase that perhaps summed up everyone's reason.</t3384>
<t3385>- We came here, - they said, - because everyone else did.</t3385>
<t3386>Remedios the Beauty, was the only one to escape the banana plague.</t3386><t3387>She kept her youthful beauty, becoming increasingly indifferent to all grooming, paying no attention to cunning tricks, always happy in her own simple, terrifyingly real world.</t3387><t3388>She couldn't understand why women complicated their lives with bras and panties, so she made herself a dress out of burlap that she could just slip over her head, solving all her problems without any fuss.</t3388><t3389>That way, she felt free and comfortable, which she believed was the best way to be at home.</t3389><t3390>Everyone nagged her to cut her long hair that flowed down to her calves, to tie it up with colorful ribbons, so she shaved it all off and used her hair to make a wig for a saint's statue.</t3390><t3391>The surprising thing about her simple instincts was that the more she discarded style for comfort, the more she ignored norms to follow her natural impulses, the more stunningly beautiful she became, and the more men desired her.</t3391><t3392>When Colonel Aureliano Buendía's sons first came to Macondo, Úrsula remembered they carried the blood of Remedios, her great-granddaughter, and felt an unprecedented fear.</t3392><t3393>"Look closely," she warned, "If you sleep with any of them, you'll give birth to a pig-tailed child."</t3393><t3394>She paid little attention to the warning, still wore boys' clothes, rolled around in the sand to climb greasy poles, nearly causing a tragedy among her seventeen cousins who were overwhelmed by the unbearable sight.</t3394><t3395>Because of this, none of them stayed at the house when visiting the village, and the four who had been there before lived separately in rented rooms arranged by Úrsula.</t3395><t3396>Nevertheless, Remedios the Beauty would have probably died laughing if she knew about these precautions.</t3396><t3397>Until her last moment on earth, she never realized that her irresistible feminine allure was a daily disaster.</t3397><t3398>Every time she appeared in the dining room, defying Úrsula's orders, she terrified the strangers present.</t3398><t3399>For two clear years, she wore that ironically oversized dress, and no one could understand that her bald head was not a challenge, and that her shamelessly exposing her legs for coolness or sucking her fingers after eating with her hands was not a provocative crime.</t3399><t3400>Strangers quickly realized that Remedios the Beauty caused terror and inner torment even hours after she had passed by.</t3400><t3401>Seasoned men, tested by love's sufferings, confirmed they had never felt such intense desire as they did before Remedios the Beauty's natural presence.</t3401><t3402>In the hallway with the begonias, in the living room, in any corner of the house, one could point out exactly where she had stood and the precise time she had left.</t3402><t3403>That trace was clear, unmistakable, but no one in the family noticed because it had long blended into the house's daily scent, while strangers recognized it immediately.</t3403><t3404>Thus, only they understood that the young guard commander might have died of love, and a distant nobleman might have despaired.</t3404><t3405>Unaware of the turmoil and harsh fate her every gesture and step caused, Remedios the Beauty always treated everyone without malice, still making them sorrowful with her innocent joy.</t3405><t3406>When Úrsula made her eat in the kitchen with Amaranta to keep strangers from seeing her, she felt more comfortable because she was even freer.</t3406><t3407>In fact, it didn't matter where she ate, and she didn't follow a set schedule; she ate whenever she felt like it.</t3407><t3408>She would get up around three in the morning to eat, then sleep all day, and for months she ate at irregular times until some coincidence brought her back to the old routine.</t3408><t3409>When everything was going smoothly, she would get up at eleven in the morning, lock herself in the bathroom, and soak naked in the tub for hours, killing scorpions and shaking off her lingering sleepiness.</t3409><t3410>Then she would use a gourd dipper to pour water over herself.</t3410><t3411>The prolonged, meticulous, enjoyable bath in the solemn silence would make anyone unfamiliar with her think she was passionately grooming herself.</t3411><t3412>But for her, the monotonous ritual was not seductive; it was just a way to pass the time while she was hungry.</t3412><t3413>One day, as she began her bath, a stranger removed a tile from the roof to look down, and he was breathless at the sight of her ivory body.</t3413><t3414>She saw his staring eyes through the hole in the roof and her reaction was not shame but fear for his life.</t3414>
<t3415>- Be careful not to fall, - she yelled.</t3415>
<t3416>- I just want to admire you.</t3416> <t3417>- The stranger whispered.</t3417>
<t3418>- Oh, really? But be careful, the roof tiles are already damaged.</t3418>
<t3419>The young man's face showed a fleeting expression of horrified pain, as if he were silently resisting the initial excitement to avoid shattering the illusion.</t3419> <t3420>Remedios - The beauty thought he was suffering because he was afraid the roof tiles would break, and she bathed more quickly than usual so he wouldn't be in danger.</t3420> <t3421>While scooping water from the jar to pour over herself, she told him that the rickety roof would cause trouble, and that the decayed leaves from the leaky rain were the reason the bathtub was always full of scorpions.</t3421> <t3422>The young man thought that her trivial talk was a way to conceal her approval, so when she began to lather soap, he took another step forward:</t3422>
<t3423>- Let me lather you with soap.</t3423>
<t3424>- Thank you for your kindness, - she said, - but my two hands are enough.</t3424>
<t3425>- Just let me massage your back, - he pleaded.</t3425>
<t3426>- There's no need for that.</t3426> <t3427>I've never seen anyone soaping their back before.</t3427>
<t3428>Then, while she was drying herself, the young man, with tears streaming down his face, earnestly begged to propose to her.</t3428> <t3429>She honestly replied that she would never marry a man so mediocre that he would waste hours, even skip a meal, just to watch a girl bathe.</t3429> <t3430>Finally, when she put on her dress, the young man couldn't bear the fact that she wasn't wearing any underwear, as everyone had suspected, and felt that this secret was like a red-hot iron branding his flesh forever.</t3430> <t3431>At that moment, the young man removed two more tiles to climb into the bathroom.</t3431>
<t3432>- Is the roof very high? - she called out, her voice filled with horror, - be careful not to fall to your death!</t3432>
<t3433>The sound of broken bricks falling clattered like a harbinger of disaster, and the strange man could only let out a terrifying scream, his skull shattered, and he died instantly on the cement floor.</t3433><t3434>The strangers in the dining room heard the crashing sound and rushed out to carry the young man's body, feeling the suffocatingly strong smell of Remedios the Beauty emanating from his skin, a smell that continued to torment the men even after death, even when they were nothing but a handful of bones.</t3434><t3435>However, they did not connect that terrible accident with the deaths of two other men also because of Remedios the Beauty.</t3435><t3436>It wasn't until there was another victim that the strangers and many people born in Macondo began to believe the legendary tale that the breath of Remedios the Beauty was not a breath of love but a killing vapor.</t3436><t3437>The story took place a few months later, one afternoon when Remedios the Beauty and some girlfriends went to see the new plantations.</t3437><t3438>Recently, the people of Macondo had a new pastime of strolling along the seemingly endless, wet roads lined with banana trees on both sides, where the silence seemed to originate from some desolate place, making sounds difficult to travel far.</t3438><t3439>Sometimes, even when only half a meter apart, they couldn't hear each other, but voices from the far end of the field echoed very clearly.</t3439><t3440>This new game gave the girls of Macondo hearty laughs or thrilling scares as they teased and frightened each other.</t3440><t3441>In the evenings, the girls often recounted these strolls as if they were dreams.</t3441><t3442>The silence was so revered that Úrsula did not dare to stop Remedios the Beauty's pastime, and one afternoon allowed her to go out on the condition that she wore a wide-brimmed hat and dressed beautifully.</t3442><t3443>From the moment the girls entered the plantation, the atmosphere seemed to be filled with a deadly fragrance.</t3443><t3444>The men working in the fields felt enchanted, threatened by an invisible danger, and many were overwhelmed by tearful terror.</t3444><t3445>Remedios the Beauty and her frightened friends just managed to hide in a nearby house when they were almost assaulted by a group of frenzied men. They were later rescued by the four Aureliano brothers, whose holy cross marks on their foreheads commanded respect, as if they were a sign of rank, of inviolability.</t3445><t3446>Remedios the Beauty did not tell anyone about one of them taking advantage of the commotion to touch her lower abdomen, his hand feeling like an eagle's claw gripping the edge of an abyss.</t3446><t3447>In an instant, she brushed off the young man's reckless hand and saw a pair of sorrowful eyes that made her heart twinge with compassion.</t3447><t3448>That night, the young man went to the Turkish street boasting about his daring and luck.</t3448><t3449>A few minutes later, he was kicked in the chest by a horse, and the crowd of onlookers witnessed him writhing in a pool of blood, dying in the middle of the street.</t3449>
<t3450>Thus, the speculation about Remedios the Beauty - who carried the authority of death within her - was proven by four irrefutable cases.</t3450> <t3451>Although some gossipers often said for the sake of talking that if they could spend one night with such an alluring woman, they would die happy, in reality, none of them made any effort to do so.</t3451> <t3452>Perhaps a simple and primal emotion like love would be enough not only to conquer her but also to avoid all dangers, but that was the one thing no one thought of.</t3452>
<t3453>Ursula no longer paid any attention to her.</t3453><t3454>In the past, when she had not yet given up on the idea of turning her into a useful person for life, she often tried to get her interested in the main household chores.</t3454><t3455>"Men often demand more than you think," she would vaguely say, "Cooking, cleaning, and countless other trivial things to worry about, beyond what you imagine."</t3455><t3456>In reality, she had deceived herself by teaching her to enjoy family happiness, because she believed that once desires were satisfied, no man on earth could endure, even for a day, such incomprehensible neglect... When the last man of the Jose Arcadio family was born, she was determined to raise him to become the Pope, so she had no energy left to worry about her great-granddaughter.</t3456><t3457>She left her alone, thinking that sooner or later a miracle would happen, and in this world where anything is possible, there would surely be a man patient enough to take her.</t3457><t3458>Amaranta had long given up any intention of trying to turn her into a useful girl.</t3458><t3459>From those long-forgotten afternoons of sewing, when her niece only liked to turn the handle of the sewing machine, she had concluded that she was a foolish girl.</t3459><t3460>"We'll have to auction you off," she said, and was very surprised by her calm attitude towards the men's flirtations.</t3460><t3461>Later, when Ursula insisted that Remedios the Beauty cover her face with a veil when going to church, Amaranta thought that this mysterious act might become so provocative that soon there would be a man curious and patient enough to find the weak spot in her heart.</t3461><t3462>But when she saw the foolish manner in which she rejected a suitor who was superior to any prince, she lost all hope.</t3462><t3463>Fernanda didn't even want to understand her anymore.</t3463><t3464>When she saw Remedios the Beauty dressed in royal attire during the bloody Carnival, Fernanda thought she was an extraordinary girl.</t3464><t3465>But when she saw her eating with her hands and responding with silly remarks, Fernanda only regretted that the fools in the family had such long lives.</t3465><t3466>Although Colonel Aureliano Buendía still believed and often repeated that Remedios the Beauty was the most intelligent and perceptive person he had ever seen, and although she often showed a strange cleverness in teasing others, the whole family had left her to the mercy of God's kindness.</t3466><t3467>Remedios the Beauty swam alone in the desert of loneliness, without a cross to bear, immersed in beautiful dreams, in endless baths, in meals without schedules, in deep silences without memories, until one March afternoon when Fernanda was in the garden wanting to fold the rough bedspreads and called the women to help her.</t3467><t3468>They had just begun when Fernanda discovered that Remedios the Beauty was completely pale.</t3468>
<t3469>- Are you sick or something? - Fernanda asked.</t3469>
<t3470>Rêmêđiôt - The beautiful woman is holding one edge of the blanket and smiling wistfully.</t3470>
<t3471>- It's not true, - she said, - I feel healthier than ever.</t3471>
<t3472>As she spoke, Fernanda felt a pleasant breeze full of light that snatched the blanket from her hands and tossed it into the sky.</t3472> <t3473>Amaranta felt a chill down her spine and clung to the blanket to avoid falling, just as Remedios the Beauty ascended.</t3473> <t3474>Úrsula, nearly blind at that time, was the only one who calmly recognized the true nature of the irresistible breeze and let the blankets fly as she watched Remedios the Beauty waving her final goodbye.</t3474>
<t3475>In the flickering light of the blankets rising with her, there was also the scent of scorpions and peonies, all following her in the atmosphere that ended at four in the afternoon, and all vanished with her forever in the high air where even the highest-flying birds never beat their wings.</t3475>
<t3476>The strangers naturally thought that Remedios the Beauty had transformed according to her predestined fate as the queen bee, and her family had tried to salvage their honor with the myth that she had flown away on her own.</t3476> <t3477>Fernanda was extremely jealous, but eventually accepted the bizarre story, and for a long time afterward continued to pray for the return of the blankets.</t3477> <t3478>Everyone believed in the miraculous story and they all burned incense and prayed.</t3478> <t3479>Perhaps no one would have talked about anything else for a long time if it hadn't been for the brutal massacre of Colonel Aureliano Buendía's sons, which turned astonishment into horror!</t3479> <t3480>Although he had never spoken his prediction out loud, Colonel Aureliano Buendía had somehow foreseen the tragic end of his sons.</t3480> <t3481>When Aureliano Serrador and Aureliano Arcaya expressed their desire to stay in Macondo, their father tried to dissuade them.</t3481> <t3482>He couldn't understand what they would do in a village that had turned dangerous overnight.</t3482> <t3483>But Aureliano Centeno and Aureliano Triste, supported by Aureliano Segundo, took them into their business.</t3483> <t3484>Colonel Aureliano Buendía had many mixed reasons for not agreeing with that decision.</t3484> <t3485>Ever since he saw Mr. Brown in the first automobile to arrive in Macondo—a bright orange car with a horn that terrified the dogs, making them bark furiously—the old soldier had been annoyed by the villagers' obsequiousness and realized that something had changed in human dignity since he had left his family, shouldered his rifle, and gone to war.</t3485> <t3486>After the Neclandia truce agreement, the local authorities had become mayors without initiative, judges in name only, chosen from among the tired and gentle conservatives of Macondo. "This is a regime of hungry devils," Colonel Aureliano Buendía commented when he saw the barefoot policemen with their batons walking by. "How many times have we risen up in war just so they wouldn't make us whitewash our own houses."</t3486> <t3487>However, when the banana company arrived, the local officials were replaced by strange functionaries brought in by Mr. Brown to live in the communal housing, the "electric chicken coop," so that they could enjoy—according to his explanation—the honor befitting their positions and not suffer the heat, mosquitoes, and countless hardships of the people.</t3487> <t3488>The old policemen were replaced by sugarcane-cutting murderers.</t3488> <t3489>Buried in his workshop, Colonel Aureliano Buendía pondered these changes, and for the first time in his years of silent solitude, he wrestled with the firm conviction that not continuing the war to the end had been a mistake.</t3489> <t3490>During those days, a forgotten brother of Colonel Magnífico Visbal took his seven-year-old nephew to drink a soda at a street vendor's stand in the square.</t3490> <t3491>Unfortunately, the child bumped into a police sergeant and spilled the soda on his clothes.</t3491> <t3492>The savage sergeant immediately drew his knife and hacked the child into pieces, and when the grandfather tried to intervene, he was beheaded.</t3492> <t3493>The entire village witnessed the old man being carried home headless, while a woman followed, holding the severed head by the hair and carrying the blood-soaked sack containing the child's body.</t3493>
<t3494>For Colonel Aureliano Buendía, this was the limit of punishment.</t3494> <t3495>Immediately, he felt the same rage he had felt in his youth when he stood before the body of a woman beaten to death by soldiers just for being bitten by a rabid dog.</t3495> <t3496>Looking at the crowds of curious people standing in front of the house, with a voice filled with unbearable hatred, he shouted loudly:</t3496>
<t3497>- One day, I will arm my children so they can put an end to these damned Gringos!</t3497>
<t3498>During that week, in different locations along the coastal region, seventeen of his children were targeted by invisible killers and shot at the mark on their foreheads as if they were rabbits.</t3498> <t3499>Aureliano Triste left his mother's house at seven in the evening when a shot from the darkness pierced his forehead.</t3499> <t3500>Aureliano Centeno died stiff on the hammock he usually tied in the factory, with an awl driven to the hilt between his eyebrows.</t3500> <t3501>Aureliano Serradoro was returning home from the cinema with his lover when, on the way back to Turkish Street, someone mingled in the crowd shot him with a revolver, causing him to collapse into a pan of boiling butter.</t3501> <t3502>A few minutes later, someone knocked on the door of the room where Aureliano Arcadio was sleeping with a woman and called out: "Hurry up, they're killing your brothers out there."</t3502> <t3503>The woman who was in the room with him later recounted that Aureliano Arcadio jumped out of bed, opened the door, and ran out, only to have his skull shattered by a burst of Mauser bullets.</t3503> <t3504>On that deadly night, as the family prepared candles for the wake of four corpses, Fernanda ran frantically around the village looking for Aureliano Segundo, who was being hidden in a wardrobe by Petra Cotes, convinced that the secret order to massacre was aimed at all those bearing the colonel's name.</t3504> <t3505>It wasn't until four days later, when telegrams received from various places along the coast made it clear that the invisible enemy's madness only targeted Aureliano's brothers with the cross mark on their foreheads, that Petra Cotes let him out.</t3505> <t3506>Amaranta searched through the small notebook where she recorded her nephews' names, crossing out each one as she received a death telegram, until only the eldest nephew remained.</t3506> <t3507>She remembered this nephew clearly because he had dark skin that contrasted with his large blue eyes.</t3507> <t3508>That was Aureliano Amador, a carpenter living in a small village deep in the forest.</t3508> <t3509>After two weeks of waiting without receiving any telegrams about him, Aureliano Segundo sent someone to warn him, fearing he was unaware of the danger hanging over his head.</t3509> <t3510>The messenger returned saying that Aureliano Amador had escaped harm.</t3510> <t3511>Two men had come looking for him at his house on the night of the massacre.</t3511> <t3512>They had shot at him, but missed the spot with the cross mark on his forehead.</t3512> <t3513>Aureliano Amador jumped over the yard fence and ran into the forest, which he knew like the back of his hand due to his timber trade with the indigenous people.</t3513> <t3514>Since then, there has been no further news of him.</t3514>
<t3515>These were truly dark days for Colonel Aureliano Buendía.</t3515> <t3516>The President of the Republic sent him a condolence telegram, promising to order a thorough investigation and to honor the memory of the deceased.</t3516> <t3517>Following the President's orders, the mayor brought four wreaths to the funeral and intended to place them on the coffins, but the Colonel had them put outside on the street.</t3517> <t3518>After the funeral, the Colonel drafted a harshly worded telegram and personally took it to the telegraph office for the President, but the telegraph operator refused to send it.</t3518> <t3519>So he wrote a few more lines with even harsher words and sent it in an envelope.</t3519> <t3520>Just like when his wife died, and the many deaths of dear friends during the war, the Colonel did not feel sorrow, but only a sense of helpless fatigue and blind madness.</t3520> <t3521>He even accused Father Antonio Isabel of colluding with the murderers because he had marked his children with a cross of indelible ash, making it easier for the enemies to identify them.</t3521> <t3522>This senile priest, who was no longer very lucid and had begun to frighten his flock with his rambling sermons, one afternoon came to the Colonel's house carrying a bowl of pre-mixed ash for marking the cross on Wednesdays, and insisted on calling the entire family to use the ash to mark a cross on their foreheads to prove that it could be washed off with plain water.</t3522>
<t3523>But the horror of misfortune was so deeply ingrained that even Fernanda didn't pay attention to that act, and from then on, no one in the Buendía family was ever seen kneeling before the altar during the fourth weekly Ash Wednesday mass.</t3523>
<t3524>For a long time, Colonel Aureliano Buendía could not calm down.</t3524> <t3525>He stopped making goldfish, had difficulty eating and drinking, and wandered around the house like a sleepwalker, dragging his cloak and simmering with a deep-seated anger.</t3525> <t3526>After three months, his hair turned completely white, his once well-groomed mustache now bristled and covered his pale lips, but on the contrary, his eyes once again shone brightly like two coals, terrifying anyone who saw him at birth and once making chairs spin when he looked at them.</t3526> <t3527>In that frenzied torment, Colonel Aureliano Buendía desperately sought in vain the omens that had led his youth down dangerous paths to the tragic desert of glory.</t3527> <t3528>He seemed lost, adrift in a strange house where no one and nothing evoked any feelings of affection in him.</t3528> <t3529>Once again, he opened Melquíades' room to search for traces of the past war, but found only piles of rubble, trash, and discarded items accumulated over years of neglect.</t3529> <t3530>On the covers of the leather-bound books that no one had opened, now moldy and green with mildew, in the space that was once the brightest and freshest in the house, there lingered the unbearable smell of rotting mattresses.</t3530> <t3531>One morning, he saw Úrsula sitting and crying under the chestnut tree, at the feet of her dead husband.</t3531> <t3532>Colonel Aureliano Buendía was the only person in the house who did not continue to see the robust old woman deteriorate over half a century of hardships.</t3532> <t3533>"Say hello to your father," Úrsula said to him.</t3533> <t3534>He paused for a moment before the chestnut tree and once again realized that the empty space meant nothing to him.</t3534>
<t3535>- What did mother say? - he asked.</t3535>
<t3536>- He looks very sad, - Ursula replied, - he probably thinks that you will die.</t3536>
<t3537>- Tell my father, - the colonel said with a smile, - that people do not die when they must die, but will die when they can die.</t3537>
<t3538>The prophecy of the deceased father stirred up the last bit of arrogance remaining in his heart, but he mistakenly thought it was a sudden surge of strength.</t3538> <t3539>Therefore, he kept asking Ursula where the gold coins found in the plaster statue of Saint Joseph had been buried in the yard. "You will never know," she said firmly, and added, "One day the rightful owner of that treasure will appear, and only that person will be able to dig it up."</t3539> <t3540>No one understood why someone who had always been so generous would show such a desire for money, and not just enough to solve an urgent matter, but a fortune so enormous that just hearing about it terrified Aureliano Segundo.</t3540> <t3541>The allies he sought for help all avoided him and refused to meet.</t3541> <t3542>It was at that moment that he was heard saying, "The only difference now between the Liberal and Conservative parties is that the Liberals go to church at five o'clock and the Conservatives go at eight."</t3542> <t3543>However, he persistently and earnestly begged, abandoning all the principles of honor he had adhered to, scraping together a little here and a little there with silent patience, and within eight months, he had amassed a sum larger than what Ursula had buried.</t3543> <t3544>At that time, he visited Colonel Gerineldo Márquez to seek help in launching a full-scale war.</t3544>
<t3545>There was a time when Colonel Gerineldo Márquez was indeed the only person who could orchestrate uprisings even while lying on the rocking chair of a paralytic.</t3545> <t3546>After the Neclandia Peace Accord, while Colonel Aureliano Buendía was hiding in the workshop making goldfish, Gerineldo Márquez was in contact with the rebel officers loyal to him until their defeat.</t3546> <t3547>With them, he waged a daily war of humiliation, of pleading and begging, with promises of "come back tomorrow," "almost there," and "we are considering your case"; a hopeless war against devoted servants who surely deserved but never received lifelong pensions.</t3547> <t3548>This war was different from the bloody twenty-year war, causing less damage than the gnawing war of permanent imposition.</t3548> <t3549>Colonel Gerineldo Márquez, who had survived three assassination attempts, lived through five wounds, and emerged unscathed from countless battles, died overwhelmed by the brutal siege of hope and tasted the humiliating defeat of old age, while thinking of Amaranta amidst the diamond-shaped lamps in the borrowed house.</t3549> <t3550>The veterans, who were still known, appeared in a newspaper through photographs, with proud faces, posing with the anonymous President of the Republic, who gave them buttons with his image to sew on their collars, and handed them a dirty, blood-stained, and gunpowder-smoked flag to drape over their own coffins.</t3550> <t3551>As for the others, those with more self-respect, they continued to wait for a letter in the twilight of public compassion, slowly dying of hunger and thirst, living in a state of madness, rotting away from old age amidst the fragrant filth of glory.</t3551> <t3552>Therefore, when Colonel Aureliano Buendía invited him to join in organizing a do-or-die war to eradicate all traces of a corrupt and scandalous regime established by foreign invaders, Colonel Gerineldo Márquez could not hold back his emotional pity:</t3552>
<t3553>- My God, Aureliano, - he sighed.</t3553> <t3554>- I know you're old, but only now do I realize that you are much older than your own aged appearance...</t3554>
<t3555>Chapter 13</t3555>
<t3556>In the tumultuous recent years, Úrsula had very little free time to take care of José Arcadio's studies to become a Pope.</t3556><t3557>When he needed to urgently prepare for exams, Meme, his sister, who grew up between Fernanda's harshness and Amaranta's bitterness, had also reached the age to enter the convent school to be trained as a small organ artist.</t3557><t3558>Úrsula was very worried and doubtful about the effectiveness of the methods used to cultivate the future Pope's lagging academic spirit, but she did not blame her own senility or her clouded eyes that almost prevented her from clearly seeing the shapes of objects; instead, she attributed it to something she couldn't precisely identify but misunderstood as an increasing waste of time.</t3558><t3559>"Years now are not like the years before," she often said, feeling her daily tasks slipping out of her grasp.</t3559><t3560>She thought: children used to grow up much slower.</t3560><t3561>She only needed to recall the time it took for José Arcadio, her eldest son, to follow the gypsies and everything that happened before he returned, tattooed like a snake and speaking like an astrologer, and all the events in the house before Amaranta and Arcadio stopped speaking the Indian dialect to learn Spanish; she only needed to remember the serene, sunlit afternoons when the poor José Arcadio Buendía suffered under the chestnut tree, and all the sorrowful events before they brought her a dying Colonel Aureliano Buendía, despite all the wars and suffering she endured for him, and yet she was still not fifty years old.</t3561><t3562>In the past, after spending the whole day making animal-shaped candies, she still had time to care for her children and look into their eyes to know if they were sick and needed a bottle of oil.</t3562><t3563>But now, with nothing to do and José Arcadio riding on her back, she wandered from dawn till late at night, this bad kind of time forced her to leave her work unfinished.</t3563><t3564>In fact, Úrsula resisted old age even when she couldn't remember her own age and hobbled around everywhere, trying to participate in everything, and teasing strangers with questions like whether during the war a plaster statue of Saint Joseph was sent to this house for the family to take care of during the rainy season.</t3564><t3565>No one knew exactly when she became blind.</t3565><t3566>Even in her final years when she was bedridden, everyone thought she was bedridden due to old age, not realizing she was blind.</t3566><t3567>She had noticed it before José Arcadio was born.</t3567><t3568>At first, she thought her eyes were just mildly sore, so she secretly drank tiger bone liquor and applied honey to her eyes, but soon she realized her vision was irreparably deteriorating to the point where she never had a clear concept of electric lights, because when the first bulbs were installed, she could only perceive a faint glow.</t3568><t3569>She didn't tell anyone because doing so would mean publicly admitting her incapacity.</t3569><t3570>She quietly learned to distinguish the distances of objects and the voices of each person, to continue seeing with her memory when her eyes had completely failed.</t3570><t3571>Later, she unexpectedly discovered that the sense of taste helped her identify objects in the dim darkness better than shapes and colors, and they helped her permanently escape the shame of being a burden.</t3571><t3572>In the darkness of her room, she could thread a needle and sew buttonholes, and know when the milk pot was about to boil.</t3572><t3573>She remembered the position of every object in the house so clearly that she sometimes forgot she was blind.</t3573><t3574>Once, Fernanda caused an uproar in the house because her wedding ring went missing, yet Úrsula found it on a shelf in the children's room.</t3574><t3575>While everyone was moving around the house, she silently stretched her four senses to monitor them to avoid being surprised, and after a while, she discovered that everyone in this family repeated the same paths, the same tasks, and even the same phrases at the same times every day without realizing it.</t3575><t3576>Only when they didn't follow that meticulous routine could something be lost.</t3576><t3577>So when she heard Fernanda panic about losing the ring, Úrsula remembered that the only unusual thing Fernanda did that day was to air out the children's mats because Meme had caught a bedbug the night before.</t3577><t3578>Since the children also participated in the cleaning, Úrsula thought Fernanda had placed the ring on the high shelf, the only place they couldn't reach.</t3578><t3579>In contrast, Fernanda only searched the usual places she frequented daily, not realizing that the habit of daily routine hindered the search for the lost item, causing her to waste so much effort.</t3579>
<t3580>Raising José Arcadio allowed Úrsula to closely monitor the minor changes in the house, which was a burdensome task for her. Upon realizing that Amaranta was dressing up the saints displayed in the bedroom, she pretended to be teaching the boy to distinguish between different colors.</t3580>
<t3581>- Well, let's see, - the old man said, - try to tell me what color clothes Saint Raphael the Archangel wears?</t3581>
<t3582>In that way, the boy would tell the old woman what her eyes could not see, and very early on, before the boy went to school, Úrsula was able to distinguish the different colors of the saints' garments placed in the bedroom.</t3582> <t3583>Occasionally, unexpected things happened. One afternoon, Amaranta was sitting and embroidering in the hallway filled with begonias, when Úrsula bumped into her.</t3583>
<t3584>- Parents, - Amaranta protested, - how are you walking like that?</t3584>
<t3585>- It's you, - Ursula said, - who is sitting in the wrong place.</t3585>
<t3586>You are right.</t3586> <t3587>From that day on, she began to notice something that no one else had realized, which was that the sun gradually shifted its position with each season of the year, causing those who usually sat in the corridor to gradually change their seats without even knowing it.</t3587> <t3588>From that day, Úrsula only needed to remember the dates to know exactly where Amaranta would be sitting.</t3588> <t3589>Although her hands trembled more and her legs increasingly felt like they couldn't lift, never before had people seen her familiar figure appear in so many places at once.</t3589> <t3590>She was almost as agile as when she managed all the household chores.</t3590> <t3591>However, in the unfathomable loneliness of old age, she was still sharp enough to notice the smallest changes in the family, so for the first time, she recognized truths that her duties had previously prevented her from seeing.</t3591> <t3592>During the time she was preparing José Arcadio for his exams, she summarized the family's life from the day the village of Macondo was founded and completely changed her opinion about her descendants.</t3592> <t3593>She realized that it wasn't because of the brutal war that Colonel Aureliano Buendía had lost his family affection, but rather that he had never loved anyone, not even Remedios—his wife, nor the countless women he had spent nights with, and certainly not his children.</t3593> <t3594>She understood that he had participated in so many wars not out of a passion for ideals as everyone thought, and he had abandoned visible victories not just out of fatigue as people believed, but because his victories and defeats were driven by one cause: sheer sinful pride.</t3594> <t3595>She concluded that the son she had given birth to was a man incapable of love.</t3595> <t3596>One night, while she was still pregnant, she had heard him cry.</t3596> <t3597>It was a clear, mournful wail that woke José Arcadio Buendía beside her, who then felt amused by the thought that the child would be a ventriloquist.</t3597> <t3598>Others guessed he would be a prophet, but she shuddered at the clear thought that the deep roar was the first sign of a terrible pig's tail, and she prayed that he would die in the womb.</t3598> <t3599>But the clarity of old age helped her realize that the cry of the child in the womb was not a sign of ventriloquism or prophetic ability, but an unmistakable sign of an incapacity for love, and she repeated this many times.</t3599> <t3600>This unfavorable assessment of her son suddenly stirred all her compassion.</t3600> <t3601>In contrast, Amaranta, whose emotional rigidity horrified her, whose bitterness concentrated in her feelings saddened her, through the final trial revealed herself to be an extraordinarily gentle woman.</t3601> <t3602>She understood with regrettable clarity that Amaranta's unreasonable torment of Pietro Crespi was not out of a desire for revenge as everyone thought, nor was her persistent torment that disappointed Colonel Gerineldo Márquez's life due to her own bitterness as people believed, but rather both actions were a life-and-death struggle between boundless love and an insurmountable weakness, and ultimately, Amaranta's irrational fear triumphed over her tormented heart.</t3602> <t3603>At that moment, Úrsula began to call for Rebeca, mentioning her with an increased affection born of belated remorse and unexpected admiration, understanding that only Rebeca, the child who did not nurse from her but grew up eating earth, earth and lime from the four walls, was the child in her bloodline who did not carry her blood but carried the blood of strangers whose bones still groaned in their graves, only Rebeca, the girl with a restless heart, a large stomach, and boundless courage, was the one Úrsula had longed for in her lineage.</t3603>
<t3604>- Rebecca, - he said, feeling his way along the wall, - how unfair the whole family has been to you!</t3604>
<t3605>Everyone in the house thought the old lady was senile, especially since she always raised her right hand to the sky like Saint Gabriel whenever she walked.</t3605> <t3606>However, Fernanda noticed a sharp clarity hidden within the shadow of that senility; for instance, Úrsula could immediately state without hesitation the amount of money the whole family had spent in the past year.</t3606> <t3607>Amaranta had such a thought one day when her mother was carrying a pot of soup in the kitchen, and although she had no idea that everyone was listening, the old lady said that the corn mill bought from the first gypsies, the mill that had disappeared before José Arcadio wandered around the world sixty-five times, was still at Pilar Ternera's house, who had also lived nearly a hundred years but was still healthy and agile.</t3607> <t3608>Despite her oversized body that terrified the children just as her laughter once scared the pigeons, Pilar Ternera was not surprised by Úrsula's clarity, because her own experience had begun to show that an old age with a clear mind could be more reliable than fortune-telling.</t3608>
<t3609>However, when Úrsula realized there wasn't enough time to nurture José Arcadio's enthusiasm, she became panic-stricken and fearful.</t3609><t3610>She began making mistakes by trying to see with her eyes what her instincts had always allowed her to see more clearly.</t3610><t3611>One morning, she poured an entire bottle of ink over the boy's head, thinking it was a bottle of holy water.</t3611><t3612>Because she wanted to meddle in everything, she caused so many conflicts that she became irritable and tried to escape the dark cloud surrounding her like a shroud of cobwebs.</t3612><t3613>It was then that she thought her clumsy awkwardness was not the first victory of old age and darkness, but the failure of time.</t3613><t3614>She thought that in the past, when God and the years had not yet set the same traps that the Turks used when measuring a yard of silk, everything was very different.</t3614><t3615>Nowadays, not only do children grow up faster, but even emotions transform in a different way.</t3615><t3616>Right after Remedios the Beauty ascended to heaven, Fernanda grumbled everywhere about how she had taken the bedspreads with her.</t3616><t3617>When the Aureliano brothers had just been laid to rest, Aureliano Segundo invited a houseful of drunken guests, playing accordions and popping champagne as if the sheep of God had not just died but rather some dogs, acting as if the house of the mad, which had annoyed so many people and produced countless animal-shaped candies, was destined to become a dump filled with ruffians.</t3617><t3618>While packing José Arcadio's trunk and recalling these things, Úrsula wondered if she should choose the path to eternal rest, have the earth packed tightly over her coffin, and then ask God without fear if He truly believed that humans were born as beasts to endure such cruel suffering.</t3618><t3619>One question after another muddled her mind, making her want to jump out, dance wildly, and babble like a foreigner.</t3619><t3620>Finally, she wanted to give herself a moment of rebellion, a moment she had longed for many times but had always submitted to reason, wanting to defecate on everything and unleash the entire stockpile of vulgar words she had suppressed for a century of constant appeasement.</t3620>
<t3621>- Damn it! - the old man hissed.</t3621>
<t3622>Amaranta, who was just beginning to pack clothes into the trunk, thought that a scorpion had just bitten her.</t3622>
<t3623>- Where is it? - she asked hurriedly.</t3623>
<t3624>- What?</t3624>
<t3625>- That scorpion. - Amaranta added.</t3625>
<t3626>Ursula pointed her finger at her chest:</t3626>
<t3627>- It's here, - the old man replied. - Here?</t3627>
<t3628>At two o'clock in the afternoon on a Thursday, José Arcadio went to take his exam.</t3628> <t3629>Perhaps Úrsula often remembered the little boy as she imagined him when she sent him off, calm and solemn, never sniffling, even though he had to endure the suffocating velvet suit with brass buttons and the silver chain around his neck.</t3629> <t3630>The boy left the dining room, leaving behind the fresh scent of Florida water that she always applied to his head so she could track his movements in the house.</t3630> <t3631>While the whole family was having a farewell lunch, everyone hid their embarrassment by pretending to be cheerful and excessively praising the jokes about Father Antonio Isabel.</t3631> <t3632>But when the velvet-covered trunk with silver-clad corners was carried away, it looked as if a coffin had just been taken out of the house.</t3632> <t3633>The only person who refused to participate in the send-off was Colonel Aureliano Buendía.</t3633>
<t3634>- This is the last nonsense missing in the house, - he muttered.</t3634> <t3635>- A priest!</t3635>
<t3636>Three months later, Aureliano Segundo and Fernanda took Meme to school and returned with a small organ, placing it where the automatic piano had been.</t3636> <t3637>At that time, Amaranta began sewing her own shroud.</t3637> <t3638>The fever surrounding the banana plantation had subsided.</t3638> <t3639>The native inhabitants of Macondo were pushed into a corner by the foreigners, struggling to maintain their meager old ways, but they were encouraged by the feeling that they had survived a shipwreck.</t3639> <t3640>Guests still came for lunch at the house, but in reality, the old habit was not reestablished until the Banana Company packed up and left a few years later.</t3640> <t3641>However, there were fundamental changes in the family's hospitality traditions, because that was when Fernanda took control of the household finances.</t3641> <t3642>Úrsula retreated into the shadows, and Amaranta spent her days fussing with mourning clothes and shrouds, so the younger sister who had learned to act like a queen now had the freedom to choose the guests and impose the strict rules she had learned from her parents.</t3642> <t3643>Fernanda's strictness kept the family adhering to their old habits in a town disrupted by the vices of the foreigners who had squandered their easily earned wealth.</t3643> <t3644>She openly stated that good people had nothing to do with the Banana Company.</t3644> <t3645>Even her brother-in-law, José Arcadio Segundo, did not escape her severity, because one noisy morning, he killed all his magnificent fighting cocks and prepared to become a foreman at the Banana Company.</t3645>
<t3646>- Don't you dare step foot in this house again if you bring the foreigner's disease here.</t3646> <t3647>- Fernanda said.</t3647>
<t3648>The discipline in the house was so strict that Aureliano Segundo only felt comfortable when he went to Petra Cotes' house.</t3648> <t3649>First, under the pretext of lessening the burden on his wife, he moved the parties and festivities there.</t3649> <t3650>Then, using the excuse that the livestock were reproducing less, he moved the cattle and horse stables there.</t3650> <t3651>Finally, claiming that it was cooler at his mistress's house, he moved his small office there to handle business matters.</t3651> <t3652>By the time Fernanda realized that she was a widow but her husband was not dead, it was too late to return things to the way they were.</t3652>
<t3653>Aureliano Segundo hardly ever ate at home, and the only outward appearances he tried to maintain, such as sleeping with his wife at home, were not enough to convince anyone.</t3653> <t3654>Due to carelessness, one time he stayed overnight with Petra Cotes until dawn.</t3654> <t3655>Contrary to what he expected, Fernanda did not scold or complain, but on that very day, she ordered his two trunks of clothes to be sent to his mistress's house.</t3655> <t3656>She openly ordered the servants to carry the trunks conspicuously down the street for everyone to see, thinking that by doing so, her wayward husband would be unable to bear the shame and would repent and return.</t3656> <t3657>But that heroic gesture was just another proof that Fernanda did not understand her husband's character, nor the customs of a village that was nothing like her parents' village, because everyone who saw the servants carrying the trunks said it was the inevitable outcome of a story everyone knew well.</t3657>
<t3658>Aureliano Segundo threw a party, eating and drinking for three days straight to celebrate his freedom.</t3658> <t3659>The biggest disadvantage for his wife was that while she was beginning to age with dark-colored clothes, old-fashioned garlands, and misplaced pride, the mistress seemed to be in her prime, always dressed in thin, colorful silk dresses, with eyes that were always blazing.</t3659> <t3660>Aureliano Segundo threw himself at her with the fervor of his youth, just like before, when Petra Cotes, not out of love but because she mistook him for his twin brother and ended up sleeping with both of them at the same time, thinking that God had blessed her with a man who had the strength of two when lying with her.</t3660> <t3661>Their passion was so intense that more than once they looked into each other's eyes while eating, and without saying a word, they covered the food with a cloche and dragged each other into the bedroom, where they succumbed to hunger and love.</t3661> <t3662>Imitating what he had seen on his secret trips with French-style prostitutes, Aureliano Segundo bought Petra Cotes a bed with a canopy, hung velvet curtains on the windows, and lined the ceiling and walls of the bedroom with huge mirrors.</t3662> <t3663>By then, he appeared even more indulgent in drinking.</t3663> <t3664>From the trains that usually arrived at eleven o'clock, he received crates of champagne and brandy every day.</t3664> <t3665>On the way back from the station, he would invite anyone he met to dance, whether they were fellow villagers or foreigners, acquaintances or strangers, wealthy or poor.</t3665> <t3666>Even Mr. Brown, who only mumbled in a foreign language, was captivated by Aureliano Segundo's charming gestures and often got drunk at Petra Cotes's house, to the point where his fierce German shepherds, which followed him everywhere, would dance to the Texan tunes he hummed, struggling to keep up with the accordion.</t3666>
<t3667>- Oh, cows, spread your legs! - Aureliano Segundo shouted amidst the chaos of the night festival.</t3667> <t3668>- Spread your legs or life will be really short?</t3668>
<t3669>Never before had he had such a cheerful face, and no one needed more than that, and his livestock had never reproduced so much.</t3669><t3670>So many cows, pigs, and chickens were slaughtered in the endless feasts that the ground in the yard became gray and muddy with blood.</t3670><t3671>The backyard became a place piled with bones, offal, and all sorts of waste, and people had to burn packets of explosives all day to keep the flocks of kites and crows from pecking out the guests' eyes.</t3671><t3672>Aureliano Segundo became obese, his face always red like a fighting cock, moving slowly because he ate as heartily as José Arcadio after returning from his wanderings.</t3672><t3673>His unprecedented gluttony, extravagant spending, and unparalleled hospitality made his reputation surpass all boundaries of the swamp region, attracting the most voracious eaters from the coastal area.</t3673><t3674>Top eaters from everywhere flocked to participate in the bizarre eating contests held at Petra Cotes's house.</t3674><t3675>Aureliano Segundo was always the winner until one unfortunate Saturday when Camila Sagastume appeared, a strange woman famous throughout the country by the name "The Female Elephant."</t3675><t3676>The eating contest lasted from Saturday until Tuesday morning.</t3676><t3677>In the first twenty-four hours, after devouring a whole roasted lamb with cassava, potatoes, and fried bananas, and drinking a barrel and a half of champagne, Aureliano Segundo was confident of his victory.</t3677><t3678>He appeared cheerful and full of life compared to his silent, more seasoned female opponent, who was less exciting to the diverse crowd packed into the house.</t3678><t3679>While Aureliano Segundo chewed and gobbled eagerly anticipating victory, "The Female Elephant" sliced her meat with the skill of a surgeon and ate slowly, even savoring the pleasure of eating.</t3679><t3680>She was a tall, robust woman, but her feminine gentleness overshadowed her enormous bulk.</t3680><t3681>She had a beautiful face, well-cared-for slender hands, and an overwhelming charm that made Aureliano Segundo whisper that he would rather compete with her in bed than at the table when he saw her walk in.</t3681><t3682>Later, seeing her politely eating a lamb leg, he seriously commented that the courteous, charming, and tireless "Female Elephant" might be an ideal type of woman.</t3682><t3683>He was not mistaken: the fierce reputation like an eagle that had been attributed to "The Female Elephant" was entirely unfounded. She was not a meat grinder, nor the bearded lady from the Greek circus as people said; she was the director of a music school.</t3683><t3684>She began learning to eat when she was already a mother looking for ways to ensure her children ate well, not through artificial stimulation but through absolute mental calmness.</t3684><t3685>Her theory, proven in practice, was based on the principle that anyone who is completely comfortable in their mind can eat continuously until they are too tired to eat anymore.</t3685><t3686>Thus, it was for spiritual reasons, not a love of sport, that she left her school and family to compete with a man famous throughout the country for his eating prowess but who followed no principles.</t3686><t3687>From the first meeting, she realized that Aureliano Segundo would lose because of his character, not his stomach.</t3687><t3688>After the first night, while she remained calm, Aureliano Segundo was almost exhausted from constantly talking and laughing.</t3688><t3689>They slept for four hours.</t3689><t3690>When they woke up, each drank the juice of forty oranges, eight liters of coffee, and thirty raw eggs.</t3690><t3691>After the second night, after many sleepless hours and having eaten two pigs, a bunch of bananas, and drunk four barrels of champagne, she felt that Aureliano Segundo might have discovered her method but was following it foolishly under the guidance of a completely irresponsible attitude.</t3691><t3692>He was a more dangerous man than she thought.</t3692><t3693>Nevertheless, when Petra Cotes brought out two more roasted turkeys, Aureliano Segundo was on the verge of bursting a blood vessel.</t3693>
<t3694>- If you can't eat anymore, - she said, - we will call it a truce.</t3694>
<t3695>She spoke sincerely and understood that she couldn't eat another bite, feeling a pang of conscience for driving her opponent quickly towards death.</t3695> <t3696>But Aureliano Segundo took it as a new challenge and continued to chew on the turkey until he far exceeded his own terrifying capacity to eat.</t3696> <t3697>He collapsed unconscious.</t3697> <t3698>He fell face down onto the plate of bones, foaming at the mouth, gasping for breath in his death throes.</t3698> <t3699>His mind went dark, and he felt as if he were being thrown from a high tower into a bottomless abyss, and in the last moment of remaining clarity, he realized that death was coming for him as he reached the end of this endless fall.</t3699>
<t3700>- Take me back to Fernanda - he could only manage to say his final words.</t3700>
<t3701>His friends brought him home, all thinking that he had kept his promise to his wife not to die in his lover's bed.</t3701>
<t3702>Pêtra Côtêt had polished the pair of boots that he wanted to wear when lying in his coffin, and was looking for someone to take them when someone came to inform him that Aurêlianô Sêgunđô was out of danger.</t3702> <t3703>Indeed, he recovered after nearly a week, and fifteen days later he organized a grand party to celebrate his miraculous survival.</t3703> <t3704>He continued to stay at Pêtra Côtêt's house, but every day he would visit Phecnanđa and occasionally stay to have meals with the family, as if fate had altered the situation, placing him in the role of the husband of his mistress and the lover of his legitimate wife.</t3704>
<t3705>That was also a relief for Fernanda.</t3705> <t3706>In the desolate abandonment, her only pastime was playing tunes on the small organ during lunch breaks and reading letters from her children.</t3706> <t3707>In the detailed letters she sent them regularly every fifteen days, not a single line was true.</t3707> <t3708>She concealed her own suffering.</t3708> <t3709>She did not let them know the sadness of a house which, despite the lights shining on the begonias, despite the suffocating afternoons, despite the bursts of festive fireworks from the street, increasingly resembled the colonial house of her parents.</t3709> <t3710>Fernanda wandered aimlessly among three living ghosts and one dead ghost of José Arcadio Buendía, who occasionally sat attentively at the door of the room while she played the small organ.</t3710> <t3711>Colonel Aureliano Buendía was a shadow.</t3711> <t3712>Since the last time he went out to the street to plan a hopeless war with Colonel Gerineldo Márquez, he hardly left his room except to urinate under the chestnut tree.</t3712> <t3713>He did not see anyone except the barber who came every three weeks.</t3713> <t3714>He nibbled on whatever Úrsula brought him once a day, and although he continued to obsessively make goldfish as before, he no longer sold them when he learned that people were not buying them as jewelry but as historical relics.</t3714> <t3715>He also took all of Remedios' dolls, which had been decorated in the bedroom since the day he married her, out to the yard, piled them up, and set them on fire.</t3715> <t3716>Úrsula, being vigilant, noticed her son's actions but could not stop him.</t3716>
<t3717>- Why is your heart so stone-cold? - the old man asked.</t3717>
<t3718>- This is not a matter of the heart? - he said.</t3718> <t3719>- The room is full of cockroaches.</t3719>
<t3720>Amaranta continued sewing her shroud.</t3720> <t3721>Fernanda did not understand why the old lady kept writing letters to Meme and even sent her gifts, yet never mentioned José Arcadio.</t3721> <t3722>"I will never understand why, even in death," Amaranta replied when Fernanda asked through Úrsula, and that response left an enigma in her heart that would never be clarified.</t3722> <t3723>Amaranta was tall and dignified, always dressed properly, with a noble attitude towards time and bitter memories.</t3723> <t3724>Amaranta seemed to bear the mark of the cross of chastity on her forehead.</t3724> <t3725>In fact, she bore the holy mark on her hand, on the black ribbon that she wore even when she slept, a ribbon she washed and ironed herself.</t3725> <t3726>All her life, she constantly sewed mourning cloths and shrouds.</t3726> <t3727>It could be said that she sewed by day and unraveled by night, and by doing so, she did not seek to defeat loneliness but rather to sustain it.</t3727>
<t3728>Fernanda's greatest worry during the years of abandonment was what would happen if Meme came home for her first summer vacations and didn't find Aureliano Segundo at home.</t3728> <t3729>The story of nearly dying from overeating put an end to that fear.</t3729> <t3730>When Meme returned, her parents had agreed not only to make her believe that Aureliano Segundo was still her mother's devoted husband but also to ensure she didn't feel the dullness of the house.</t3730> <t3731>Every year, Aureliano Segundo played the role of a model father for two months.</t3731> <t3732>He organized fun events with ice cream and sweets along with the lively music of the enthusiastic and energetic student.</t3732> <t3733>Her personality from that time on was clearly not much like her mother's.</t3733> <t3734>Perhaps it was only a shadow of Amaranta before bitterness took over, always dancing and singing, making noise around the house when she was twelve or fourteen years old, that is, before her secret desires for Pietro Crespi completely changed the direction of her heart.</t3734> <t3735>But unlike Amaranta, unlike everyone else, Meme showed no signs of the family's solitude, as if she were completely in harmony with the world even when she sat alone in the living room practicing the piano diligently.</t3735> <t3736>It was clear that she enjoyed the house, as she eagerly awaited the children's excitement to welcome her home all year long, and she shared her father's penchant for fun and extraordinary hospitality.</t3736> <t3737>The first sign of inheriting that trait emerged in the third summer, when Meme returned with four nuns and sixty-eight classmates.</t3737> <t3738>She spontaneously thought of inviting them home for a week without any prior notice.</t3738>
<t3739>- Isn't it miserable? - Fernanda lamented. - This girl is just as troublesome as her father. At home, we had to borrow beds and hammocks from neighbors, arrange nine rounds of meals, schedule bathroom times, and find forty chairs so that the girls in uniform wearing boys' shoes wouldn't be dancing around the house all day.</t3739> <t3740>The invitation turned into a disaster because the noisy schoolgirls, after finishing breakfast, started having lunch in shifts, then continued with dinner, and throughout the whole week, they only went out once.</t3740> <t3741>In the evening, the nuns were exhausted, too tired to move, let alone shout orders, while the tireless young students kept singing loudly in the yard.</t3741> <t3742>Once, the girls almost trampled on old Úrsula, who always wanted to do something right where she couldn't.</t3742> <t3743>Another time, the nuns made a fuss because Colonel Aureliano Buendía was urinating under the chestnut tree without paying any attention to the girls gathered in the yard.</t3743> <t3744>Amaranta nearly caused a panic when a nun walked into the kitchen while she was adding salt to the soup, and the only question the nun asked was what that pinch of powder was. "Arsenic," Amaranta replied.</t3744>
<t3745>The night they first arrived, the girls made a lot of noise about going to the bathroom before bed, yet even at one in the morning, there were still people waiting outside the toilet.</t3745> <t3746>Fernanda then bought seventy-two chamber pots, but that only shifted the nighttime chaos to the morning, because at dawn the girls would line up in front of the bathroom, each holding her own pot, waiting for her turn to wash it.</t3746> <t3747>Although a few girls had fevers and some were itchy from mosquito bites, most of the girls showed remarkable endurance in the face of the greatest difficulties, and even during the hottest hours, they still chattered away in the garden.</t3747> <t3748>In the end, when the girls had left, the flower beds were in ruins, furniture was broken and scattered, and the walls were covered with drawings and writings, but Fernanda forgave all the destruction in exchange for the relief of their departure.</t3748> <t3749>She returned the beds and chairs and stored the seventy-two chamber pots in Melquíades' room.</t3749> <t3750>The empty room, which had once belonged to the person who brought spiritual life to the whole house, was from then on called the chamber pot room. To Colonel Aureliano Buendía, it was the most fitting name, because while everyone marveled at how Melquíades' room remained undamaged and dust-free, he saw it as having turned into a dung pen.</t3750> <t3751>In any case, the question of who was right or wrong did not matter to him.</t3751> <t3752>He knew the fate of the room because Fernanda kept interrupting his work all afternoon to arrange dozens of chamber pots in there.</t3752>
<t3753>In those days, Hôsê Accađiô Sêgunđô was seen at home again.</t3753> <t3754>He walked hurriedly through the hallway, greeted no one, and sat in the workshop talking to the colonel.</t3754> <t3755>Even without seeing him, Ucsula only needed to hear the sound of the overseer's heels to be surprised by the irreparable distance that had grown between him and the family, even with his twin brother, who had once played innocent hide-and-seek games with him and now bore no resemblance to him.</t3755> <t3756>He was tall, solemn, contemplative, somewhat sad, and his pale face revealed a tragic gleam.</t3756> <t3757>He was the man who resembled Santa Sôphia de la Piêđat, his mother, the most.</t3757> <t3758>Ucsula had blamed the desire to forget him when discussing household matters, but when she felt his presence at home once more and realized that the colonel received him for hours in his jewelry workshop, she immediately revisited her distant memories and became even more convinced of her belief that at some point in his childhood, he had swapped names with his twin brother, because it was he, not the other, who had been called Aurêlianô. No one knew the small details of his private life.</t3758> <t3759>There were times when people knew he wasn't in any specific place; sometimes he raised fighting cocks at Pila Tecnêra's house and occasionally slept there, but most nights he slept in the rooms of the prostitutes.</t3759> <t3760>He lived a wandering life, without any emotion, without any desire, like a bright star in Ucsula's universe.</t3760>
<t3761>In fact, José Arcadio Segundo was not a member of this family and would never be a member of any other family, ever since that distant early morning when Colonel Gerineldo Márquez led him to the barracks not to witness an execution but so that he would never forget the sorrowful smile tinged with irony of the condemned man.</t3761> <t3762>That was not only his oldest memory but also his only memory from his childhood.</t3762> <t3763>As for another memory, the memory of an old man wearing an outdated coat and a raven-wing hat sitting right in front of a brightly lit window telling wondrous tales, he still could not place it in any specific period.</t3763> <t3764>It was a vague memory, completely unnecessary for any teachings or for nostalgia, contrary to the memory of the condemned man which, in fact, had guided his life, and it returned to his memory more clearly as he grew older, as if the passage of time was gradually leading him back to it. Úrsula intended to use him to make Colonel Aureliano Buendía abandon the gold workshop where he had secluded himself.</t3764> <t3765>"Convince your uncle to go see a movie," she told him. "Even if he doesn't like movies, at least he'll have a chance to breathe some fresh air."</t3765> <t3766>But it wasn't long before she realized that he was just like the Colonel, indifferent to her pleas, and she understood that he too had become impervious to all affectionate feelings.</t3766> <t3767>Although she did not know and no one knew what the two of them discussed during their long conversations in the gold workshop, she understood that they were the only two members of the family who seemed to be connected by deep mutual understanding.</t3767>
<t3768>In fact, even José Arcadio Segundo could not drag the colonel out from where he had imprisoned himself.</t3768> <t3769>The noisy visits of Meme's school friends to the house had exceeded the limits of the colonel's patience.</t3769> <t3770>Using the excuse that their bedroom was infested with cockroaches that had chewed up Remedios' beautiful dolls, he hung a hammock right in the goldsmith's workshop, and from then on, he stayed there, only coming out when absolutely necessary.</t3770> <t3771>Úrsula couldn't find an opportunity to talk to him.</t3771> <t3772>She knew well that he didn't look at the food tray but just left it at the end of the large table while he finished making a goldfish, not even noticing the soup that had formed a skin and the cold fried meat.</t3772> <t3773>He had become more difficult since Colonel Gerineldo Márquez refused to help him ignite a hopeless bloody war.</t3773> <t3774>He isolated himself even more, as if he had locked his heart, and thus the family thought of him as a dead man.</t3774> <t3775>He was not seen again until he stepped out the front door to watch the circus parade on October 11.</t3775> <t3776>For Colonel Aureliano Buendía, it was a day like any other in the final years of his life.</t3776> <t3777>At five in the morning, the chaotic croaking of frogs and the droning of insects outside the four walls woke him up.</t3777> <t3778>The steady rain had been falling since Saturday, and he didn't need to hear the raindrops pattering on the garden leaves because he could feel the rain in his very bones.</t3778> <t3779>As usual, he put on his wool coat with long cotton underwear, which, though dusty and old, he still called "the underwear of the strong."</t3779> <t3780>He wore narrow trousers but didn't button them and didn't use the gold button to fasten his shirt collar because he intended to go to the bathroom.</t3780> <t3781>Then he draped the wool coat over his head like a hood, combed his thick beard with his fingers, and urinated in the yard.</t3781> <t3782>Dawn was still far off, and José Arcadio Buendía was still sleeping fitfully in the palm-leaf hut, decayed by the rain.</t3782> <t3783>He didn't see him as he never did, nor did he hear the incomprehensible words his father's ghost said when it woke with a start from the hot urine splashing on its shoes.</t3783> <t3784>He didn't go to the bathroom immediately, not because of the cold or dampness, but because of the thick October fog.</t3784> <t3785>Returning to the goldsmith's workshop, he smelled the strong odor of the stoves that Santa Sofía de la Piedad was lighting, and he stood in the kitchen waiting for the coffee to boil so he could take a cup of unsweetened coffee back to his room.</t3785> <t3786>As every morning, Santa Sofía de la Piedad asked him what day it was, and he replied that it was Wednesday, October 11.</t3786> <t3787>Seeing the bold woman glowing in the firelight, he remembered, as he did at any other time in his life, a day, October 11, during the fierce war, when a rough certainty that the girl who had slept with him had died woke him up.</t3787> <t3788>Indeed, the girl had died, and he never forgot that day because she had asked him what day it was just an hour before.</t3788> <t3789>Despite this recollection, he still didn't fully realize how much the omens had abandoned him, and while the coffee boiled, purely out of curiosity and without a hint of nostalgia, he continued to think about the woman whose name he never knew and whose face he never clearly saw because she had stumbled in the dark to find his hammock.</t3789> <t3790>However, among the many women who had come into his life in that manner, he didn't remember that she was the one who, in that first emotional encounter, had nearly drowned in her tears and had promised to love him forever, even until death, less than an hour before she died.</t3790> <t3791>He didn't think about her anymore, nor would he think about anyone else, once he entered the goldsmith's workshop, lit the lamp, and counted the goldfish in the tin box.</t3791> <t3792>Ten in total, since deciding not to sell them anymore, he made only two a day, and when he had twenty-five, he melted them down to start over.</t3792> <t3793>He worked diligently all morning, completely focused on his work, unaware that it started raining at ten o'clock, and someone passing by the workshop door shouted for everyone to close their doors to avoid flooding, and he was completely oblivious to himself until Úrsula entered the workshop with his lunch and turned off the lamp.</t3793>
<t3794>- Oh my God, why is it raining so heavily, - Ucsula said.</t3794>
<t3795>- October rain! - he said.</t3795>
<t3796>While saying that sentence, he did not take his eyes off the first golden fish he made that day, because he was trying to inlay the golden pupils into its eyes.</t3796> <t3797>Only after finishing and placing it into the tin bucket did he start sipping the soup.</t3797> <t3798>After that, he ate very slowly, stir-fried meat with onions, white rice along with slices of fried bananas, all of these dishes were placed together on a large plate.</t3798> <t3799>His way of enjoying food was not disrupted in the most beautiful circumstances nor in the most difficult and harsh ones.</t3799> <t3800>When he was about to finish eating, he felt the desire to rest.</t3800>
<t3801>According to a scientific belief, he never worked, read books, bathed, or even entered a room unless two hours had passed for his digestive system to function, and this was such a firm belief that sometimes he delayed carrying out battles to prevent his soldiers from suffering congestion.</t3801> <t3802>So he lay down in a hammock, used a pocket knife to remove the wax plug from his ear, and within a few minutes, he was sound asleep.</t3802> <t3803>He dreamed that he was entering an empty house with white walls, and the worry that he was the first person to step into this house made him uneasy.</t3803> <t3804>In that dream, he remembered that the night before he had dreamed the same thing, and not just the night before, but every night in the last years of his life, he had dreamed the same thing.</t3804> <t3805>He knew that this image would be erased from his memory upon waking, because this recurring dream could only be remembered within the dream itself.</t3805> <t3806>Indeed, a moment later, when the barber knocked on the jeweler's workshop door, Colonel Aureliano Buendía woke up with the feeling that he had accidentally fallen asleep for a few brief minutes and that he hadn't had time to dream of anything at all.</t3806>
<t3807>- I'm not getting a haircut today, - he said to the barber.</t3807> <t3808>- Please make an appointment for Friday.</t3808>
<t3809>The speckled beard with white strands of his had not been shaved for three days, but he felt it was not yet necessary to shave, as he would cut his hair on Friday and do it all at once.</t3809><t3810>The sticky sweat from an unwanted afternoon nap had reddened the mosquito bite scars under his armpits.</t3810><t3811>The rain had stopped, but the sun had not yet appeared.</t3811><t3812>Colonel Aureliano Buendía burped loudly, and this burp brought back to his tongue the sour taste of the soup he had just eaten.</t3812><t3813>And it felt like a command from his body, forcing him to throw on his coat and head to the latrine immediately.</t3813><t3814>He sat in the latrine longer than necessary, squatting over the mushy feces spilling out of the wooden bucket below, until habit reminded him that it was time for the afternoon's work.</t3814><t3815>While sitting and waiting, he remembered that today was Wednesday and that José Arcadio Segundo was not yet at the goldsmith's workshop because today was payday at the banana company's plantations.</t3815><t3816>This memory, like all other memories in the last years of his life, he carried not to recall the years of war.</t3816><t3817>He remembered that Colonel Gerineldo Márquez had once promised him that he would find a horse with a white star on its forehead, and that it had been a long time since the colonel had mentioned it again.</t3817><t3818>Then he thought about other scattered stories, but he remembered them without any particular order.</t3818><t3819>To avoid thinking about other matters, he had learned to think about them in the coldness of his life, so that those unavoidable memories, when they returned, would not make him sentimental.</t3819><t3820>When he returned to the goldsmith's workshop, seeing the sky had cleared, he decided that it would be perfect to take a bath now, but Amaranta stopped him.</t3820><t3821>So he began working on the second goldfish of the day.</t3821><t3822>While he was attaching the tail to the fish, the sun burst out so strongly that the light roared like the sound of a fishing boat.</t3822><t3823>The sky, cleansed by the three-day rain, was now thick with flying ants.</t3823><t3824>Immediately, he felt the urge to urinate again, but he held it until he finished the goldfish.</t3824><t3825>He stepped into the yard at four fifteen, hearing from afar the sound of brass instruments, loud drums, and the joyful shouts of children, and for the first time since he was a young man, he consciously fell into the trap of nostalgia, reliving the marvelous afternoon of the gypsies that his father had taken him to see the ice.</t3825><t3826>Santa Sofía de la Piedad left her work in the kitchen unfinished and ran to the front door:</t3826>
<t3827>- Circus! - she screamed.</t3827>
<t3828>Instead of going to the chestnut tree, Colonel Aureliano Buendía went to the gate and blended into the crowd of curious onlookers watching the circus parade.</t3828> <t3829>He saw a woman dressed in yellow riding on the back of an elephant.</t3829> <t3830>He saw a sad-looking dromedary.</t3830> <t3831>He saw a bear holding a ladle, tapping it against a pot in rhythm with the music.</t3831> <t3832>He saw clowns performing tightrope acts at the end of the procession.</t3832> <t3833>Once again, his face displayed his pitiful loneliness as the circus passed by, leaving behind only a brightly lit void on the road, with the air thick again with flying ants and some curious people peering into the endless abyss of ambiguity.</t3833> <t3834>Only then did he return to the chestnut tree, and while urinating, he tried to continue thinking about the circus, but he couldn't grasp the memory anymore.</t3834> <t3835>He raised his arms to embrace his head, like a chick, then stood still, his forehead resting against the trunk of the chestnut tree.</t3835> <t3836>The family was unaware of this.</t3836> <t3837>It wasn't until the next day, at eleven in the morning, when Santa Sofía de la Piedad went to the backyard to throw out the trash, that she was horrified to see the hawks swooping down, swooping down.</t3837>
<t3838>Chapter 14</t3838>
<t3839>The last summer vacation of Meme coincided exactly with the mourning period for Colonel Aureliano Buendía.</t3839><t3840>In the house, which remained closed and silent all day, there was no place for festivities.</t3840><t3841>People whispered, ate quietly, prayed three times a day, and even the organ playing sessions had a mournful tone.</t3841><t3842>Despite secretly disliking the Colonel, Fernanda, moved by the solemn respect the government showed in commemorating their arch-enemy, meticulously organized the funeral.</t3842><t3843>As usual, Aureliano Segundo slept at home while his daughter was on summer vacation, and Fernanda needed to do something to reclaim the honor of being the official wife, because the following year, Meme welcomed a newborn sister named Amaranta Úrsula, a name given by everyone despite the mother's wishes.</t3843>
<t3844>Mêmê has finished her studies.</t3844> <t3845>The diploma certifies that she is a recognized harpsichord artist, thanks to the skill she used to play 17th-century folk music at the graduation ceremony, which also served as a memorial for the late Colonel.</t3845> <t3846>The guests admired her not only for her performance art but also for her dual nature... Her frivolous and sometimes childish demeanor seemed incompatible with any serious activity, but the moment she sat down at the harpsichord, she became a completely different girl.</t3846> <t3847>The maturity that was not previously evident gave her an adult appearance.</t3847> <t3848>She was always like that.</t3848> <t3849>In fact, Mêmê had no clear inclination, but she achieved the highest results by always working with strict discipline to avoid conflicts with her mother.</t3849> <t3850>If she had been forced to learn any other profession, she would certainly have achieved similar results.</t3850> <t3851>From a very young age, Fernanda's strict nature made her uncomfortable, but she was accustomed to sacrificing for others, and often this habit was even greater than her pursuit of the harpsichord, which she followed just to avoid clashing with her stubborn mother.</t3851> <t3852>At the graduation ceremony, she felt a joyful sense that the diploma, written in Gothic letters with decorative capital letters, would free her from the commitment she had accepted not just to obey, nor to keep the peace, and she believed that from this moment on, even the stubborn Fernanda would no longer be concerned with the harpsichord, which the nuns had considered an outdated artifact in the museum.</t3852> <t3853>In the early years, she thought her calculations were completely wrong because after half the town had gone to sleep, not only in her living room but in countless social gatherings, school events, and celebrations organized in Macondo, her mother continued to invite new audiences whom she knew could appreciate her daughter's qualities.</t3853> <t3854>After Amaranta's death, and only then, when everyone stayed home during the mourning period, Mêmê could completely detach herself from the harpsichord and leave the keychain in any wardrobe without worrying that Fernanda would be upset and search to see when and who had lost the key.</t3854> <t3855>Mêmê endured her mother's displays with the same patience she had during her studies.</t3855> <t3856>That was the price she had to pay for her freedom.</t3856> <t3857>Fernanda was so delighted with her daughter's gentle demeanor, so proud of everyone's admiration for her talent, that she did not prevent her friends from filling the house, from spending entire afternoons in the banana fields, and from watching movies that Father Antonio Isabel publicly permitted, along with Aureliano Segundo or trusted family friends.</t3857> <t3858>During those joyful moments, Mêmê's true interests became evident.</t3858> <t3859>Her happiness lay on the other side of strict discipline, in noisy festivities, in idle conversations about love, in gatherings where the girls locked their room to practice smoking and talk about boys, and once they even passed around and drank three bottles of white liquor, ending up naked to compare their body parts.</t3859> <t3860>Mêmê would never forget the night she walked into the house chewing licorice root, and because no one noticed she was drunk, she sat down at the table where Fernanda and Amaranta were quietly having dinner.</t3860> <t3861>Before that, she had spent two terrible hours in a friend's room, crying incessantly out of sadness and fear, and on the other side of that emotional crisis, she found a strange boldness she had lacked to run away from school, to tell her mother things that would make her furious about the harpsichord.</t3861> <t3862>Sitting at the head of the table, sipping chicken broth that felt like an elixir reviving the dead when it reached her stomach, Mêmê saw Fernanda and Amaranta immersed in the harsh light of reality.</t3862> <t3863>She had to restrain herself from telling them directly about their falseness, intellectual poverty, and vain desire for honor.</t3863> <t3864>From the second summer vacation onward, she knew her father only stayed home for appearances, and by understanding Fernanda as she did and by helping her to later understand Petra Cotes, she sided with her father.</t3864> <t3865>There were times when she wished to be the daughter of her father's lover.</t3865> <t3866>In her drunken stupor, Mêmê thought that if she expressed her thoughts at that moment, everyone would be surprised, and the silent joy of her mischievousness was so strong that Fernanda noticed:</t3866>
<t3867>- What's wrong, child? - she asked.</t3867>
<t3868>- It's nothing, - Meme replied.</t3868> <t3869>- It's only now that I realize how much I love my great-aunt and mother.</t3869>
<t3870>Amaranta was startled to realize that the answer contained a hint of resentment.</t3870><t3871>In contrast, Fernanda was so moved that she felt she was going mad when Meme woke up in the middle of the night, her head writhing in pain and choking on bile.</t3871><t3872>She gave her a bottle of castor oil, placed a mustard plaster on her stomach, and applied an ice bag to her head, then put her on a diet and kept her in a draft-free room for five days according to the prescription of the newly arrived eccentric French doctor, who, after two hours of examination, came to the bizarre conclusion: the girl had menstrual disorders.</t3872><t3873>In her state of mental collapse, Meme had no choice but to remain silent.</t3873><t3874>Úrsula, now completely blind but still active and sharp, was the only one who diagnosed correctly.</t3874><t3875>"To me," she thought, "these symptoms are clearly those of a drunkard."</t3875><t3876>But not only did she dismiss that thought, she also blamed herself for her superficial thinking.</t3876><t3877>Aureliano Segundo felt a pang of conscience when he saw Meme's exhausted condition, so he promised to pay more attention to her in the future.</t3877><t3878>Thus, a close and cheerful relationship between father and daughter was born, which for a time freed him from lonely revelries and freed Meme from Fernanda's supervision without causing inevitable family quarrels.</t3878><t3879>At that time, Aureliano Segundo ignored all commitments to be by her side.</t3879><t3880>Meme, spending most of his free time taking her to the movies or the circus.</t3880><t3881>In recent days, his bulky and slow body no longer allowed him to bend down to tie his shoelaces, and his exuberance had begun to wane.</t3881><t3882>The discovery of his daughter revived his youthful exuberance, and the pleasure of being close to her gradually distanced him from his wasteful indulgences. Meme blossomed into adulthood.</t3882><t3883>She was not beautiful, just as Amaranta had never been beautiful, but she was open, approachable, and gave an immediate impression of likability.</t3883><t3884>She had a progressive mind.</t3884><t3885>And this progressive mind pitied Fernanda's outdated pride and hardened heart, and was strongly supported by Aureliano Segundo.</t3885><t3886>He was the one who decided to take her out of the bedroom from a young age, where the terrifying eyes of the saints continued to scare her even into adulthood, and he arranged for her a room with a cushioned bed, a spacious dressing room, and velvet curtains, not realizing that it was a replica of Petra Cotes' room.</t3886><t3887>He was so generous with her that he didn't even know how much money he had, as she took it from his pockets, and he provided her with countless new jewelry whenever she visited the banana company's agents.</t3887><t3888>Meme's room was filled with bags of pumice for polishing nails, hair curlers, tooth polishers, boxes of eye shadow, and an array of cosmetics and strange jewelry that every time Fernanda entered, she worried that her daughter's dressing room resembled that of modern prostitutes.</t3888><t3889>However, during that period, Fernanda followed a schedule divided between caring for little Amaranta Úrsula, who was still fussy and often sick, and writing heartfelt letters to unseen doctors. So, when she discovered the collusion between her husband and daughter, the only promise she demanded from Aureliano Segundo was that he would not take Meme to Petra Cotes' house.</t3889><t3890>It was a meaningless demand because the mistress was so upset by the intimacy between Aureliano Segundo and his daughter that she had no desire to get to know Meme.</t3890><t3891>An unprecedented anxiety tormented her as if instinct had warned her that Meme only needed to love him to take away what Fernanda could not: a love considered to be a lifelong bond.</t3891><t3892>For the first time, Aureliano Segundo had to endure the sulking and terrible tantrums of his mistress, so much so that he feared his traveling trunks would be sent back to his wife's house.</t3892><t3893>But this did not happen.</t3893><t3894>No woman understood a man as well as Petra Cotes understood her lover, and she knew that those trunks would remain where they were because if there was one thing Aureliano Segundo detested, it was disrupting his life with reforms and changes.</t3894><t3895>So the trunks stayed put, and Petra Cotes set out to win back the man using the only weapon her daughter could not match.</t3895><t3896>It was an unnecessary effort, as Meme had no intention of involving herself in her father's personal matters.</t3896><t3897>She didn't have time to bother anyone.</t3897><t3898>She swept her own room and made her bed as the nuns had taught her.</t3898><t3899>In the morning, she sewed her dresses, sometimes embroidering on the porch, sometimes sewing with Amaranta's hand-cranked sewing machine.</t3899><t3900>During siesta time, she practiced the piano for two hours, knowing that daily diligence would keep Fernanda calm.</t3900><t3901>For the same reason, she continued to perform symphonies at charity sales and school events, even though invitations were becoming less frequent. In the evening, she groomed herself, wore the simplest clothes, put on high boots, and if she didn't need to accompany Aureliano Segundo, she would visit her friends until dinner time.</t3901><t3902>It was rare for Aureliano Segundo not to come find her to take her to the movies.</t3902>
<t3903>Among Meme's friends, there were three American girls who had broken through the fence of the apartment complex, which resembled a "chicken coop with electric wiring," and had formed friendships with the girls from Macondo village.</t3903> <t3904>One of these three girls was Patricia Brown. Out of gratitude for Aureliano Segundo's generosity, Mr. Brown opened his home to Meme and invited her to the Saturday dances, which were the only occasions where Americans and locals mingled.</t3904> <t3905>When Fernanda found out, she temporarily put aside caring for little Amaranta Úrsula and writing letters to her invisible doctors to make a big fuss about it.</t3905> <t3906>"Just think about it," she said to Meme, "what would the Colonel think from his grave?".</t3906> <t3907>She sought Ursula's support.</t3907> <t3908>But the blind old woman, contrary to everyone's expectations, believed there was nothing to worry about in Meme attending the dances and maintaining friendships with the American girls, as long as her great-granddaughter always held firm to her principles and didn't become a follower of Protestantism.</t3908> <t3909>Meme understood her great-great-grandmother's thoughts perfectly, and the day after the dances, she would wake up earlier than usual to attend mass.</t3909> <t3910>Fernanda's opposition persisted until the day Meme announced that the Americans wanted to hear her play the piano, which made her change her stance.</t3910> <t3911>Once again, the piano was taken out of the house and brought to Mr. Brown's home, where the young pianist received the most sincere applause and the warmest congratulations.</t3911> <t3912>From then on, she was invited not only to the Saturday afternoon dances but also to the Sunday swimming sessions at the pool and a weekly lunch.</t3912> <t3913>Meme swam like a professional athlete, played tennis, and learned to eat Virginia sausages with pineapple slices.</t3913> <t3914>She quickly learned English during the dances, swimming sessions, and tennis practices.</t3914> <t3915>Aureliano Segundo was so delighted with his daughter's progress that he bought a six-volume English encyclopedia with many colored pictures from a traveling bookseller for her to read in her spare time.</t3915> <t3916>Reading consumed the time and attention she previously devoted to her beloved friend or to closing herself in her room with her girlfriends, not because she was forced to read as a discipline but because she had no interest in idle chatter, which was a common affliction among people.</t3916> <t3917>She recalled her drunken escapade as an innocent adventure that she found amusing enough to share with Aureliano Segundo, who enjoyed it even more than she did. "If your mother knew," he said to his daughter, laughing heartily.</t3917> <t3918>As he often told her to believe in herself, he also told her that with that same confidence, she could reveal her first love to him.</t3918> <t3919>And so Meme told him about her closeness with a red-haired American boy who had come there for summer vacation with his parents. "Quite the guy, huh?" Aureliano Segundo laughed, "If your mother knew."</t3919> <t3920>But Meme also told him that the young American had returned to his country, and she hadn't heard from him since.</t3920> <t3921>Thus, her maturity in thinking ensured peace and harmony in the family.</t3921> <t3922>At this time, Aureliano Segundo spent more time with Petra Cotes, and although his body and soul no longer allowed him to indulge in wild partying as before, he didn't miss an opportunity to organize them and didn't leave the accordion alone, even though many keys had to be tied with shoelaces.</t3922> <t3923>At home, Amaranta sewed her shroud without knowing when it would be finished, while Ursula let old age drag her into the depths of blindness, where the only visible image was that of José Arcadio Buendía under the chestnut tree.</t3923> <t3924>Fernanda consolidated her power.</t3924> <t3925>The monthly letters she sent to her son José Arcadio now contained no lies, except for her correspondence with the invisible doctors, who had diagnosed an inflammation in her colon and were preparing to experiment with a remote treatment method.</t3925>
<t3926>It is rumored that in the weary house of the Buendía family, there would be eternal warmth and happiness if Amaranta's sudden death did not once again throw the entire town into chaos.</t3926> <t3927>It was an unexpected event.</t3927> <t3928>Although she was old and lived completely isolated from everyone, people still saw her as steady and strong, walking upright with the enduring health she had always possessed.</t3928> <t3929>No one knew her thoughts since she resolutely rejected Colonel Gerineldo Márquez and shut herself in her room to cry alone.</t3929> <t3930>When she emerged from the room, she had exhausted all her tears.</t3930>
<t3931>People did not see her cry over Remedios the Beauty ascending to heaven, over the massacre of all seventeen sons of Colonel Aureliano Buendía in a short period, or over the death of the Colonel himself, whom she loved most in the world.</t3931><t3932>Although she expressed her sorrow when everyone found his body under the chestnut tree, she did not shed a single tear.</t3932><t3933>She helped to set the corpse upright.</t3933><t3934>She dressed him in his warrior outfit, shaved him, combed his hair, and groomed his beard even better than he had during his glorious days.</t3934><t3935>No one thought that in this gesture, she revealed her love because everyone was accustomed to Amaranta's proficiency in funeral rites.</t3935><t3936>Fernanda flew into a rage, thinking that Amaranta did not understand Christianity's relationship with life but only its relationship with death, as if it were not a religion but merely a flyer for funeral formalities.</t3936><t3937>Amaranta was too deeply immersed in her chaotic memories to comprehend those profound insinuations.</t3937><t3938>She had reached old age with all her fresh, vivid recollections.</t3938><t3939>When she heard Pietro Crespi's waltzes, she still had the urge to cry like in her youth, as if time and self-punishment meant nothing.</t3939><t3940>The music tapes she had once thrown away under the pretext that they were ruined by moisture continued to play and beat rhythmically in her memory.</t3940><t3941>She had intended to drown those desires in the sinful passion within permissible limits with her nephew Aureliano José and sought refuge under the healthy and noble protection of Colonel Gerineldo Márquez, but she could not completely extinguish those desires even in the most desperate act of old age; that was when she bathed little José Arcadio three years before sending him to school and caressed him not as a grandmother would a grandchild but as a woman would a man, just as the modern prostitute did according to rumors and as she herself had wanted to do with Pietro Crespi at twelve or fourteen, seeing him in his dancing clothes and holding the magical baton to keep time from the metronome.</t3941><t3942>Sometimes the scar on her hand caused her anguish for having followed her, and sometimes it made her so furious that she pricked her fingers with a needle, but the lush, fragrant guava garden of love approaching death caused her the most suffering, the most anger, and the most bitterness.</t3942><t3943>As Colonel Aureliano Buendía thought of war, Amaranta thought of Rebeca, meaning it was unavoidable.</t3943><t3944>But while her brother had found a way to dry out those memories, she only sought to inflame them further.</t3944><t3945>The only thing she had prayed to God for many years was that He would not let her die before Rebeca.</t3945><t3946>Every time she passed by Rebeca's house and saw it deteriorating more and more, she felt joy at the thought that God was hearing her prayer.</t3946>
<t3947>One afternoon, while sewing in the hallway, a clear thought suddenly arose in her mind, and she realized that she would be sitting in that very spot, in that very position, and in that very light, when the news of Rebecca would be brought to her.</t3947><t3948>She waited for the news as someone waits for a letter, and it was clear that there was a time when she would rip off all the buttons only to sew them back on again, simply because sitting idle could not compete with the long and painful wait.</t3948><t3949>No one in the family knew that Amaranta was at that moment weaving a precious shroud for Rebecca.</t3949><t3950>Later, when Aureliano Triste recounted that he had seen her turn into a wrinkled ghost with only a few tufts of blonde hair left on her head, she was not surprised at all because the described image was exactly the same as the image of Rebecca she had imagined for a long time.</t3950><t3951>She had decided to reconstruct Rebecca's corpse, using wax to make her face plump and using hair from saint statues to create a wig for Rebecca.</t3951><t3952>She would create a beautiful corpse with a linen shroud and a velvet-lined coffin adorned with red tassels, and she would place this coffin in the presence of the attendants typically seen at lavish funerals.</t3952><t3953>She built this plan with so much hatred that she shuddered at the thought that she had organized this funeral as if with all her love, but she could not let the confusion deter her; instead, she continued to perfect the smallest details to the point where she became more skilled than a professional in funerals.</t3953><t3954>The only thing she did not realize in this meticulously crafted plan was that she might die before Rebecca, even though she had fervently prayed to God. Indeed, that happened.</t3954><t3955>But in the last days of her life, Amaranta did not feel sorrow; on the contrary, she felt liberated from all bitterness, because death had given her the honor of being forewarned that her death would occur a few years earlier than she had planned.</t3955><t3956>One scorching afternoon, shortly after Meme had started school, while she was sewing in the hallway, she saw death.</t3956><t3957>She recognized it immediately, and it was not frightening at all, because it was a woman dressed in sky-blue with long flowing hair, looking somewhat outdated, somewhat resembling the image of Pilar Ternera in the days when she used to help cook for the family.</t3957><t3958>Sometimes Fernanda stood right in front of her, but she did not recognize her, even though Fernanda was very real, very human, even when she asked her to thread a needle.</t3958><t3959>Death did not tell her when she would die, nor did it say whether her death would occur before Rebecca's, but it simply told her to start sewing her own shroud on the sixth of April.</t3959><t3960>Death allowed her to make the shroud as elaborate and beautiful as she wished, but also as dignified as the one she had made for Rebecca.</t3960><t3961>And death also told her that she would die without pain, without fear, and without bitterness on the very night she finished sewing her own shroud.</t3961><t3962>To intentionally prolong the time, Amaranta spun the linen thread herself and wove the fabric by hand.</t3962><t3963>She worked so meticulously that this task alone took her four years.</t3963><t3964>Then she began the embroidery on the shroud.</t3964><t3965>Thus, the inevitable day of completion drew closer, and with it, she increasingly understood that only a miracle would allow her to extend the work beyond Rebecca's death, but the concentration on her work restored the peace of mind she had lacked to accept the unfortunate thought.</t3965><t3966>It was then that she understood the somewhat morbid cycle of production and consumption in Colonel Aureliano Buendía's goldfish-making.</t3966><t3967>The outside world shrank to the surface of his skin, while his inner self remained outside all bitterness.</t3967><t3968>She felt pained for not understanding this many years earlier, when she could still purify her memories and build a new world under a new light, recalling the lavender scent of Pietro Crespi at dusk without shuddering, and freeing Rebecca from her hatred, neither out of anger nor love, but simply out of sympathy for her loneliness.</t3968><t3969>The hatred she recognized in Meme's words one night agitated her not because it offended her, but because she felt herself being repeated in another adolescence that seemed as pure as the one she should have had, and it was a pity that it had been tainted by personal resentment. But that was the moment when her resignation to her fate was so profound that it did not shake her before the evident truth that all doors leading to repentance had been closed.</t3969><t3970>Her sole purpose now was to complete the shroud.</t3970><t3971>Instead of working slower as she had initially done, she now hurried to finish it.</t3971><t3972>A week earlier, she had calculated that on the night of February fourth, she would make the final stitch.</t3972><t3973>Without revealing the reason, she asked Meme to perform the piano concert earlier than planned, the very next day, but her niece refused.</t3973><t3974>So Amaranta found a way to extend the work by forty-eight more hours, and she thought death had agreed with her because on the night of February fourth, a storm knocked down the power lines.</t3974><t3975>But the next day, at eight in the morning, she made the final stitch on the extraordinarily beautiful shroud that no woman had ever made, and without any suffering, she announced that she would die in the afternoon.</t3975><t3976>She not only informed her family but also the entire village.</t3976><t3977>Because Amaranta thought that a small life could end with helping the entire community, and she believed that no favor could be greater than carrying letters for the dead.</t3977>
<t3978>The news that at sunset Amaranta Buendía would depart from this world and could carry letters for the dead spread throughout the town of Macondo, and by three in the afternoon, there was a box full of letters in the living room.</t3978> <t3979>Those who did not want to write asked Amaranta to convey their messages orally, and she recorded the messages in a notebook along with the names and dates of death of the recipients.</t3979> <t3980>"Don't worry," she reassured the message senders, "The first thing I will do when I get there is to inquire about him, and I will relay your message."</t3980> <t3981>It seemed like a farce.</t3981> <t3982>Amaranta did not show any signs of anxiety, nor did she grimace in pain; moreover, the task even made her look a bit younger.</t3982> <t3983>As usual, she was still cheerful and lively.</t3983> <t3984>If her cheeks were not wrinkled and her mouth had not lost a few teeth, she would surely appear less old than her current aged appearance.</t3984> <t3985>She herself had ordered that the letters be placed in a painted box and instructed how to place the box in the tomb to better protect it from the destructive effects of moisture.</t3985>
<t3986>Early in the morning, she had called a carpenter and stood in the living room while he measured for the coffin, just as a tailor would measure for a suit.</t3986><t3987>That strength suddenly revived in her in the final moments of her life, making Fernanda think she was mocking and playing with everyone.</t3987><t3988>Úrsula, with her own experience showing that members of the Buendía family would die without illness, did not doubt that Amaranta had received a premonition of death. However, she first feared that in the process of delivering letters to the dead and the eagerness to get the letters to the recipients quickly, Amaranta might be buried alive.</t3988><t3989>So she personally drove people out of the house, sometimes having to shout to argue with those who were too stubborn. Finally, by four in the afternoon, she had managed to significantly reduce the number of visitors. At that same hour, Amaranta distributed her personal belongings to the poor, leaving only a simple coffin made of unplaned boards, a set of clothes to change into, and a pair of velvet shoes she would wear in death.</t3989><t3990>This caution was not in vain, as she remembered that when Colonel Aureliano Buendía died, she had to buy him a new pair of shoes because he only had slippers used in the gold workshop.</t3990><t3991>Just before five o'clock, Aureliano Segundo came home to find Meme so they could attend a concert together, and he was surprised to see the house prepared for a funeral.</t3991><t3992>If anyone was alive at that hour, it was the healthy Amaranta, who still had enough time to cut off the calluses on her skin.</t3992><t3993>Aureliano Segundo and Meme bid her farewell with mocking words and promised her that next Saturday they would hold a resurrection celebration.</t3993><t3994>Drawn by the rumors that Amaranta Buendía was receiving letters to deliver to the dead, Father Antonio Isabel brought the Eucharist for the dying to the house at five o'clock and had to wait fifteen minutes for the supposedly dying woman to come out of the bath.</t3994><t3995>When he saw her appear in a cotton nightgown with her hair loose down her back, the old priest believed it was a joke and immediately canceled the last rites.</t3995><t3996>However, he thought it necessary to take this opportunity to make Amaranta confess why she hadn't attended church in twenty years.</t3996><t3997>Amaranta simply replied that she saw no need to attend any church services because her conscience was always very clear.</t3997><t3998>Fernanda, irritated and unable to hold her tongue, loudly asked if Amaranta would commit a more heinous sin by wishing for a sacrilegious death without confession out of shame.</t3998><t3999>So Amaranta lay down and forced Úrsula to publicly attest to her chastity.</t3999>
<t4000>- Don't you dare think that, - she shouted loudly so that Fernanda could hear clearly, - Amaranta Buendía will leave this world as she came into it.</t4000>
<t4001>She no longer sat up.</t4001> <t4002>She lay back on the pillow as if truly ill, braiding her long pigtails and coiling them around her ears, as if Death had told her to lie down in a coffin.</t4002> <t4003>Then she asked Úrsula to bring her a mirror, and for the first time in forty years, she looked at her face, now gaunt with age and suffering, and was surprised to see it looked exactly like the imagined face she had conjured for herself.</t4003> <t4004>Through the silence in the hallway, Úrsula understood that night was beginning to fall.</t4004>
<t4005>- Say goodbye to Fernanda, - he advised - A moment of reconciliation is better than a lifetime of friendship, my child.</t4005>
<t4006>- Now it's no longer necessary, Mom.</t4006>
<t4007>Mêmê couldn't help but think of Amaranta when the light signaling the end of the first part lit up and the second part of the night's performance was about to begin.</t4007> <t4008>When she was halfway through the piece, someone whispered in her ear that Amaranta had passed away, and thus the celebration was cut short.</t4008> <t4009>When he got home, Aureliano Segundo had to elbow his way through the crowd to get a look at the face of the old virgin, a face that was ugly and ashen, with hands still bearing the black ribbon and the entire body wrapped in a beautiful shroud.</t4009> <t4010>The coffin was laid out in the living room next to the mailbox.</t4010>
<t4011>Ursula was bedridden since nine o'clock on the night Amaranta died.</t4011> <t4012>Santa Sofia de la Piedad took care of her.</t4012> <t4013>She brought her meals, daily wash water, and all the news happening in the town of Macondo. Aureliano Segundo frequently visited her, bringing her clothes.</t4013> <t4014>She kept them at the head of her bed along with her daily necessities.</t4014> <t4015>Thus, a world of objects was soon established within her reach.</t4015> <t4016>She had awakened a deep respect in the young Amaranta Ursula, who resembled her exactly and whom she taught to read.</t4016> <t4017>Her clarity of mind and the agility that allowed her to take care of herself made everyone forget that she was entirely overcome by the weight of a hundred years, and even her groping movements did not make anyone think she was completely blind.</t4017> <t4018>Thus, she spent all her time, all her inner silence, observing the family's life, and she was the first to notice Meme's silent suffering.</t4018>
<t4019>- Come here, my dear, - the old lady said - Now it's just the two of us, tell this poor old woman what has happened to you.</t4019>
<t4020>With intermittent laughter, Meme avoided the conversation.</t4020> <t4021>Ursula did not insist, but she confirmed her suspicions when she no longer saw Meme visiting.</t4021> <t4022>She knew that Meme was getting ready too early, that she was never at ease while waiting to go out, that all night she tossed and turned in the bed in the next room, and that the fluttering of a certain butterfly tormented her soul.</t4022> <t4023>Once, she heard people saying that Meme went to the movies with Aureliano Segundo, and Ursula was surprised that Fernanda was so lacking in imagination that she did not suspect anything when her husband came home asking where their daughter was.</t4023> <t4024>It was clear that Meme was passionate about secret affairs, urgent rendezvous, and repressed desires, long before the night Fernanda made a fuss about catching her with a man kissing in the movie theater...</t4024>
<t4025>At this moment, it was Meme herself who was extremely worried to the point that she blamed Ursula for being the one who had exposed her.</t4025> <t4026>In fact, it was she who had exposed herself.</t4026> <t4027>For a long time, she had left behind a long trail of clues that could awaken even the most oblivious person, and if Fernanda was too slow in discovering these clues, it was only because she was also deeply preoccupied with her own private matters with the invisible doctors.</t4027> <t4028>Nevertheless, she had just noticed the silent secrecy, the untimely jumps, the unusual mood swings, and even the arguments of her daughter.</t4028> <t4029>She threw herself into an investigation that, while not harsh, was very persistent.</t4029> <t4030>She let her go out with her long-known girlfriend, helped her dress up to attend Saturday night parties, and never asked her any untimely questions that might startle her.</t4030> <t4031>She had plenty of evidence proving that Meme said one thing and did another, and she remained suspicious and waited for the right moment.</t4031> <t4032>One night, Meme told her that she was going to the movies with her father.</t4032> <t4033>Shortly after, Fernanda heard the unmistakable sounds of party fireworks and the accordion music of Aureliano Segundo from Petra Cotes' house.</t4033> <t4034>So she hurriedly dressed and went to the movie theater, and from the back rows, she immediately recognized her daughter.</t4034> <t4035>Being too overwhelmed by the evident truth, she did not have time to look at the man who was kissing her daughter.</t4035> <t4036>But she clearly heard the trembling voice that stood out above the whistles and loud laughter of the audience: "My love, I'm very sad."</t4036> <t4037>She heard him say that and pulled Meme up, dragging her out of the theater without a word.</t4037> <t4038>She made her mortified as she led her through the noisy Turkish Street.</t4038> <t4039>Then she locked her in her bedroom.</t4039>
<t4040>At six o'clock in the evening the next day, Fernanda recognized the voice of the person visiting Meme.</t4040> <t4041>It was a young man, pale and sallow, with dark and dreamy eyes that did not surprise her as much as she was accustomed to seeing in gypsies, and this dreamy look immediately made the woman with a less harsh heart understand the reasons for her daughter's changed demeanor.</t4041> <t4042>He was wearing common linen clothes, shabby white patent leather shoes, and holding a straw hat he had bought the previous Saturday.</t4042> <t4043>In his life, he had never been as frightened as he was at this moment, but he possessed self-respect and self-control, precious qualities that saved him from falling into a state of subservience, and he had a well-proportioned body, though his hands were calloused and his nails chipped from hard labor.</t4043> <t4044>To Fernanda, just a glance was enough for her to recognize his profession as a mechanic.</t4044> <t4045>She noticed that he was still wearing his only Sunday outfit and beneath his shirt was a layer of skin mottled and flaking from the itch caused by the Banana Company.</t4045> <t4046>She did not allow him to speak, did not allow him to step through the door, which she had to close immediately because the house was already full of yellow butterflies...</t4046>
<t4047>- Get out immediately, - she chased him away, - it's none of your business to come here looking for anyone.</t4047> <t4048>Everyone here is respectable.</t4048>
<t4049>His name was Mauricio Babilonia.</t4049><t4050>He was born and raised in the town of Macondo and was an apprentice mechanic in the workshops of the banana company.</t4050><t4051>It was only by chance that Meme met him one afternoon while she was out with Patricia Brown looking for a car to drive around the banana fields.</t4051><t4052>Because the driver was sick, he was assigned to drive the girls around, and Meme fulfilled her wish of sitting close to the driver to watch him drive.</t4052><t4053>Unlike the regular driver, Mauricio Babilonia put on a show for her.</t4053><t4054>That was the time when Meme often visited Mr. Brown's house, and it was also a time when women drivers were still looked down upon. Yet, Meme was content with just learning the theory and did not visit Mauricio Babilonia for several months.</t4054><t4055>But after a while, she might have remembered that during their outing, his strong and handsome body, except for his rough hands, had caught her attention, but later she complained to Patricia Brown about her discomfort caused by his somewhat arrogant confidence.</t4055><t4056>On the first Saturday she went to the movies with her father, she saw Mauricio Babilonia again, still wearing his linen clothes, sitting not far from them, and she felt that he was not interested in the movie but kept turning his head to look at her, not just to see her but to let her know that he was looking at her.</t4056><t4057>Meme was uncomfortable with this rude behavior.</t4057><t4058>At the end of the movie, Mauricio Babilonia approached to greet Aureliano Segundo, and it was only then that Meme realized they knew each other because he had worked at the first power plant in Macondo, owned by Aureliano Triste, and he behaved towards her father with the attitude of a subordinate.</t4058><t4059>Witnessing this eased the discomfort his arrogance had caused her.</t4059><t4060>They did not meet privately, nor did they exchange any words beyond polite greetings, but the night she dreamed that he saved her from drowning, she was not grateful but angry with him.</t4060><t4061>Because the dream suggested that she had given him the opportunity he had always wished for, while Meme desired the opposite, not just with Mauricio Babilonia but with any boy who loved her.</t4061><t4062>Thus, she was so angry with him that after the dream, instead of hating him, she felt the need to see him immediately.</t4062><t4063>The eagerness to see him again grew stronger throughout the week.</t4063><t4064>And Saturday came so quickly that she had to make a great effort to ensure that Mauricio Babilonia, when greeting her at the cinema, did not notice her heart pounding out of her chest.</t4064><t4065>Overwhelmed by mixed feelings of joy and anger, for the first time she extended her hand to him, and only then did Mauricio Babilonia allow himself to shake her hand firmly.</t4065><t4066>For a moment, Meme began to regret her boldness, but the regret immediately turned into intense satisfaction when she realized that his hand was also sweaty and cold.</t4066><t4067>That night she understood that she would not have a moment of peace until she showed Mauricio Babilonia the emptiness of her soul, and so she spent the entire week wandering around in that longing.</t4067><t4068>She tried every trick to get Patricia Brown to take her to find the car but to no avail.</t4068><t4069>Finally, she had to rely on the red-haired American boy who had come to Macondo for the summer with his family, and under the pretext of looking at new car models, she made him take her to the workshop. From the moment she saw him, Meme could no longer deceive herself and understood that in reality, she could not resist the desire to be alone with Mauricio Babilonia, but the certainty that he had understood her feelings as soon as he saw her made her angry.</t4069>
<t4070>- I came to see the new car models, - Mêmê said.</t4070>
<t4071>- That's also a good reason, - he said.</t4071>
<t4072>Même knew that she was being roasted in the proud flames of his passion and she hurried to find a way to humiliate him.</t4072> <t4073>But he did not give her the time.</t4073> <t4074>"Don't be startled," he said gently: "It's not the first time a woman has gone mad over a man."</t4074> <t4075>She felt so deeply insulted that she left the workshop without even looking at the new car models, and that night she tossed and turned in bed, crying from the frustration in her heart.</t4075> <t4076>The red-haired American young man, who by now had actually started to like her, felt she was just a child.</t4076> <t4077>That was the time she began to notice the yellow butterflies that heralded the presence of Mauricio Babilonia.</t4077> <t4078>Before that, she had seen them, especially at the workshop, and thought they were attracted by the smell of paint.</t4078> <t4079>A few times, she felt them fluttering right above her head in the cinema.</t4079> <t4080>But when Mauricio Babilonia began to pursue her like a ghost that only she could recognize in the crowd, she understood that these yellow butterflies were intimately connected to him. Mauricio Babilonia was always present in the crowd at concerts, in the cinema, at mass, and she didn't need to see him to know he was there because the yellow butterflies pointed out his location.</t4080> <t4081>Once, Aureliano Segundo felt very uncomfortable with the suffocating flutter of the yellow butterflies, so she felt an urge to reveal her secret to him as promised, but her instincts told her that this time he wouldn't laugh as he usually did. "What will your mother say when she sees him."</t4081> <t4082>One morning, while mother and daughter were pruning the rose bushes, Fernanda suddenly screamed in panic and hurriedly pulled Meme away from where they were standing because it was the very garden where Remedios the Beauty had ascended to the sky.</t4082> <t4083>She had a fleeting feeling that the miracle might happen again to her daughter because the sudden buzzing made her jump.</t4083> <t4084>It was the sound of the yellow butterflies.</t4084> <t4085>Même saw them as if they had just been born in the light, and her heart raced.</t4085> <t4086>At that moment, Mauricio Babilonia appeared, carrying a box, which he said was a gift from Patricia Brown.</t4086> <t4087>Même tried to act naturally, suppressing the redness in her face and calming the storm in her heart, until she managed a serene smile and asked him to kindly place it on the balcony because her hands were dirty with soil.</t4087> <t4088>The only thing Fernanda noted about the man she would not allow into the house in the following months, and did not recognize having seen him before, was his pale, sallow complexion.</t4088>
<t4089>- He is a strange man, - she said.</t4089> <t4090>You can tell just by looking at his face that he will die.</t4090>
<t4091>Meme thought that her mother enjoyed those butterflies.</t4091> <t4092>After the mother and daughter finished pruning the roses, she went to wash her hands and then brought the gift box to her room to open it.</t4092> <t4093>It was a Chinese toy, consisting of five concentric boxes, and in the innermost box there was a card written by someone who seemed to have just learned to write very neatly: "We will meet on Saturday at the cinema."</t4093> <t4094>Meme felt foolish for leaving the gift box on the balcony for so long, right in front of Fernanda's curious eyes, even though at that moment she was content with Mauricio Babilonia's cleverness and boldness, and his innocence encouraged her to keep the appointment.</t4094> <t4095>From then on, Meme knew that Aureliano Segundo had an appointment with his lover on Saturday night.</t4095> <t4096>However, the burning desire that had been consuming her all week led her to persuade her father to let her be alone at the cinema on Saturday, and to pick her up when the show ended.</t4096> <t4097>A butterfly fluttered above her head as the lights were on.</t4097> <t4098>And so the story began from there.</t4098> <t4099>When the lights went out, Mauricio Babilonia sat down next to her.</t4099> <t4100>Meme felt like she was drowning in a swamp of sorrow, and only a man reeking of machine oil could save her from it.</t4100>
<t4101>- If you don't come, - he said, - you will never see me again.</t4101>
<t4102>Mêmê felt the weight of his hand on her knee and she knew that in that moment, both of them had reached the other side of the emptiness.</t4102>
<t4103>- I really hate you, - she smiled, - because you always say things you shouldn't say.</t4103>
<t4104>She went mad and crazy because of him.</t4104> <t4105>She lost sleep, lost her appetite, and sank deeper into loneliness to the point that her father had become an obstacle for her.</t4105> <t4106>She concocted an intricate web of empty promises to deceive Fernanda, avoided visiting her girlfriends, and broke all conventions to meet Mauricio Babilonia anytime and anywhere.</t4106> <t4107>At first, his crudeness made her uncomfortable.</t4107> <t4108>The first time they met alone, right in the open field behind the mechanical workshop, he wore her out without a hint of pity.</t4108> <t4109>It took her some time to realize that it was also a form of caress, and because of it, she was eager to see him.</t4109> <t4110>She lived only for him, only for the desire to immerse herself in his oil-scented breath.</t4110>
<t4111>Shortly before Amaranta died, while she was passionately in love, she suddenly encountered a flash of insight and became fearful for her future.</t4111> <t4112>At that time, she heard about a woman who had the talent of reading cards and secretly sought her out.</t4112> <t4113>That woman was Pila Tecnêra.</t4113>
<t4114>From the moment she saw her step into the house, the old woman knew right away the reason for Meme's fortune-telling visit.</t4114><t4115>"Come, sit down," the old woman said. "I don't need cards to see the future of a Buendía." Meme did not know, and would never know, that the hundred-year-old medium was actually her great-great-grandmother.</t4115><t4116>She also did not believe in the terrible reality that the medium had shown her: the craving for love could only be satisfied in bed.</t4116><t4117>That was Maurício Babilônia's viewpoint, but Meme tried not to let him, because deep down she suspected that her craving had been sparked by the mechanic's vile thoughts.</t4117><t4118>Now she thought that one kind of love would overthrow the other, because she knew well that men's hunger would be sated once they were satisfied.</t4118><t4119>Pilar Ternera not only consoled her but also lent her the old bed where the old woman had conceived Arcadio, Meme's grandfather, and later Aureliano José. Additionally, the old woman taught her how to avoid pregnancy by inhaling mustard leaf fumes and gave her potions that, in the most critical cases, would expel "even the pangs of conscience."</t4119><t4120>That heart-to-heart talk instilled in Meme the bold feelings she exhibited during the drunken night.</t4120><t4121>However, Amaranta's death forced her to postpone her daring decision.</t4121><t4122>During the nine-day funeral, she did not leave Maurício Babilônia's side for a moment, who often mingled with the crowd that flocked into the house.</t4122><t4123>Afterward, due to the extended mourning period and being required to stay home, the two did not see each other for a while. Those were days of restlessness, uncontrollable cravings, and repressed desires so intense that the very afternoon Meme was allowed to leave the house, she went straight to Pilar Ternera's home.</t4123><t4124>She gave herself to Maurício Babilônia, gave herself without resistance, without shame, without pretense, and with such an easy-going disposition and intuitive understanding that a suspicious man like hers would have mistaken it for experienced expertise.</t4124><t4125>They made love twice a week for over three months.</t4125><t4126>Their secret trysts were tacitly supported by Aureliano Segundo, who wanted to see his daughter freed from her mother's strict supervision.</t4126>
<t4127>The night Fernanda caught them kissing in the movie theater, Aureliano Segundo felt suffocated by the weight of his conscience and he visited Meme in her room, where she was locked up by Fernanda, hoping that she would share the faith that he still owed her.</t4127> <t4128>But Meme refused everything.</t4128> <t4129>She was too confident in herself, too clinging to her loneliness to the extent that Aureliano Segundo felt there was no longer any connection between them, that the father-daughter bond and their complicity were just an illusion of the past.</t4129> <t4130>He thought of talking to Mauricio Babilonia, believing that his former authority would force him to give up all intentions, but Petra Cotes convinced him that it was a matter for women.</t4130> <t4131>Thus, he hesitated, unsure of what decision to make, and he almost hoped that locking Meme in her room would end his daughter's suffering.</t4131>
<t4132>Mêmê did not reveal her suffering at all.</t4132> <t4133>On the contrary, from the next room, Ucsula sensed her rhythmic breathing while she slept, the calmness in her daily tasks, the regular order of her meals, and her strong digestion.</t4133> <t4134>The only thing that worried Ucsula after nearly two months of her being punished with confinement was that Mêmê no longer bathed in the morning as she used to, but instead bathed at seven in the evening.</t4134> <t4135>Once, she thought of reminding Mêmê to beware of scorpions, but since Mêmê was very upset with her, thinking that she had betrayed her, she did not want to trouble her great-granddaughter with untimely words.</t4135> <t4136>From the afternoon onwards, yellow butterflies filled the house again.</t4136> <t4137>Every evening, upon leaving the bathroom, Mêmê would find Fernanda frantically killing yellow butterflies with a mosquito spray.</t4137> <t4138>"This is a misfortune," she said, "All my life I've heard people say that moths bring bad luck to the house."</t4138> <t4139>One evening, while Mêmê was in the bathroom, Fernanda happened to step into her room and found it so full of yellow butterflies that there was hardly any air left to breathe.</t4139> <t4140>So she grabbed any piece of clothing to shoo them away, and her heart suddenly chilled when she connected her daughter's evening baths with the mustard leaves scattered on the floor.</t4140> <t4141>She did not wait for a good opportunity as she had before.</t4141> <t4142>The next day, she angrily invited the new mayor to have lunch with the family.</t4142> <t4143>Like her, he had just moved from the highlands to live on the coast.</t4143> <t4144>She asked him to have soldiers guard the backyard at night because recently thieves had been stealing chickens.</t4144> <t4145>That very night, the guards shot Maurício Babilônia as he was lifting tiles to sneak into the bathroom where Mêmê was waiting for him.</t4145> <t4146>She was naked and trembling with passion among the scorpions and the swarm of yellow butterflies, as she had done most evenings in recent months.</t4146> <t4147>A bullet lodged in his spine, confining him to bed for the rest of his life.</t4147>
<t4148>He died old in loneliness, without a groan, without a curse, without a plot of betrayal.</t4148> <t4149>He languished in a situation tormented by memories and the yellow butterflies that did not allow him a moment of peace.</t4149> <t4150>He was abandoned by society because he was a chicken thief.</t4150>
<t4151>Chapter 15</t4151>
<t4152>The events that once dealt a fatal blow to the town of Macondo began to reveal themselves when Meme Buendía's son was brought to the house.</t4152> <t4153>The general circumstances at the time were so vague that no one cared about the troubles of individual families, which gave Fernanda the opportunity to hide the boy away, pretending he never existed.</t4153> <t4154>She had to accept him because when he was brought to the house, circumstances did not allow her to refuse.</t4154> <t4155>She had to endure raising him for the rest of her life because at the crucial moment, she lacked the courage to carry out her secret intention of drowning him in the bathroom water tank.</t4155> <t4156>She locked him in Colonel Aureliano Buendía's old workshop.</t4156> <t4157>She made Santa</t4157> <t4158>Sofía de la Piedad believe that she had found the boy lying in a basket floating on the water.</t4158> <t4159>Perhaps Úrsula never knew the boy's origins until her death.</t4159> <t4160>Little Amaranta Úrsula once entered the workshop just as Fernanda was feeding her grandson, and she too believed the story of the basket floating on the river.</t4160> <t4161>Completely alienated from his wife in protest of the absurd way she had handled Meme's tragedy, it was three years after the boy was brought to the house that Aureliano Segundo learned of his grandson's existence.</t4161> <t4162>He found out because one day Fernanda was careless, allowing the boy to escape his confinement and step out into the hallway for just a moment.</t4162> <t4163>He was naked, with curly hair and a "bird" with a beak like a turkey's, as if he were not a child but a cannibal as described in the encyclopedia.</t4163>
<t4164>Fernanda did not care about her cruel and unchangeable fate.</t4164> <t4165>The boy seemed like the return of a disgrace that she wanted to banish from her house forever.</t4165> <t4166>Almost as soon as they carried Mauricio Babilonia, who had a broken spine, out of the house, Fernanda conceived a plan down to the smallest detail to erase every trace of this shame.</t4166> <t4167>Without consulting her husband, the very next day she started preparing the luggage, packing three sets of clothes that her daughter would need for changing, and about half an hour before the train arrived at the station, she went to the bedroom to find her daughter:</t4167>
<t4168>- Let's go, Renata, - she told her daughter.</t4168>
<t4169>She did not explain to the girl.</t4169> <t4170>As for Meme, she neither waited for nor wanted an explanation.</t4170> <t4171>Not only did she not know where she and her mother were going, but if they were taking her to the slaughterhouse, she wouldn't have objected.</t4171> <t4172>She fell silent and would not open her mouth for the rest of her life from the moment she heard the gunshot in the backyard, followed by the painful cry of Mauricio Babilonia.</t4172> <t4173>When her mother ordered her out of bed, she did not comb her hair or wash her face and wandered onto the train like a sleepwalker, unaware that even the yellow butterflies were still following her.</t4173> <t4174>Fernanda never understood, nor did she try to understand, whether Meme's stone-like silence was a voluntary decision or if she was mute due to the harmful impact of the tragedy.</t4174>
<t4175>It seemed that Meme was unaware that the train was passing through the region she used to enjoy the most.</t4175> <t4176>She did not look at the lush and endless banana fields on either side of the tracks.</t4176> <t4177>She did not look at the white-painted American houses, nor at the gardens withered by dust and heat, nor at the women in shorts and striped shirts playing cards outside their doors.</t4177> <t4178>She did not look at the ox carts carrying bananas on the dusty roads.</t4178> <t4179>She did not look at the young girls like little fish jumping in the crystal-clear river that made the tourists on the train feel a pang of longing at the sight of their splendid, full breasts, nor at the shabby huts of the laborers where Mauricio Babilonia's yellow butterflies fluttered, nor at the pale and dirty children, nor at the pregnant women shouting obscenities whenever the train passed by.</t4179> <t4180>The fleeting scenery that used to be as joyful as a festival for her every time she returned home from school now did not move her at all.</t4180> <t4181>She did not even bother to look out the window when the train passed through the opium fields where the remains of the Spanish steamboat had turned to coal, only to then reach the open air next to the foamy and filthy sea, where nearly a century ago the beautiful ideas of José Arcadio Buendía had failed.</t4181>
<t4182>At five o'clock in the afternoon, when the train arrived at the final station in the swamp region, she followed her mother off the train.</t4182><t4183>The two of them climbed into a carriage that looked like a giant bat, pulled by a wheezing horse, and they passed through a desolate city, where on the endless, cracked streets from the sulfur fumes, the same piano practice piece that Fernanda used to hear during her afternoon naps in her youth still echoed.</t4183><t4184>They boarded a riverboat with a wooden paddle wheel that roared like the noise of a great fire, and the rusted iron plates, full of holes, reflected the sunlight like the mouths of furnaces.</t4184><t4185>Memé locked herself in a private cabin on the boat.</t4185><t4186>Twice a day, Fernanda placed a tray of food by her bed, and twice a day she took it away untouched, not because Memé had resolved to starve herself, but because just the smell of food was enough to terrify her and make her stomach tighten and retch.</t4186><t4187>She herself did not know that the mustard plaster no longer had a contraceptive effect, and Fernanda did not find this out until a year later when a baby boy was brought to her.</t4187><t4188>Being in the stifling private cabin, disturbed by the vibration of the boat and the pungent smell of mud stirred up by the paddle wheel, Memé lay in a stupor, unaware of the passage of time.</t4188><t4189>It had been a long time since Memé had seen the last yellow butterfly crushed by the propeller, and she felt it as an undeniable truth: Mauricio Babilonia was dead.</t4189><t4190>However, she did not let resignation overcome her.</t4190><t4191>She continued to think of him throughout the journey across the vast plains where Aureliano Segundo had once gotten lost while searching for the most beautiful woman in the world, and as they climbed the mountain pass along the Indian trails to a dreary city, where the narrow cobblestone streets still echoed with the mournful, raspy bells of thirty-two churches.</t4191><t4192>That night, she and her mother slept in an abandoned colonial church, lying on planks that Fernanda had laid over the floor of a room overgrown with weeds, and they covered themselves with pieces of window curtains that tore with every movement.</t4192><t4193>Memé knew exactly where she was because in her fearful insomnia, she had seen a young nobleman dressed in black pass by, who had been brought to the house in a lead coffin on the night before a long-ago Christmas Eve.</t4193><t4194>The next day, after attending mass, Fernanda led her to a castle shaded by trees, and Memé recognized it immediately from her mother's stories about the convent where she had been educated to become a queen, and thus Memé understood that her journey had ended.</t4194><t4195>While Fernanda talked to someone in the next room, she stayed in the parlor, which was adorned with oil paintings of colonial bishops, shivering because she was still wearing a dress made of black-embroidered leather and boots swollen with the snowmelt from the plains.</t4195><t4196>She stood in the middle of the parlor under the yellow light filtering through the stained glass windows, thinking of Mauricio Babilonia, until a very beautiful young nun carrying her small suitcase and three sets of clothes emerged from the next room.</t4196><t4197>As she passed Memé without stopping, she extended her hand to her.</t4197>
<t4198>- Let's go, Renata, - the nun said.</t4198>
<t4199>Meme took her hand and let her lead her away.</t4199> <t4200>The last time Fernanda saw her was when she was walking with the nun, just as the iron door of the convent slowly closed behind her.</t4200> <t4201>She still thought of Mauricio Babilonia, of the smell of grease and the yellow butterflies incarnate, thought of him throughout her entire life, a life with constantly changing names and without uttering a word until the early morning of an autumn day when she died old in a hospital in Krakow.</t4201>
<t4202>Fernanda returned to Macondo on a train protected by armed police officers: Throughout the journey, she noticed the passengers' anxious tension, the military measures applied in the villages along the railway, and the atmosphere of fear due to the belief that a serious event was about to happen, but she was completely unaware of any news until she reached Macondo.</t4202><t4203>Upon arriving home, she was told that José Arcadio Segundo was inciting the banana company workers to protest.</t4203><t4204>"Oh, this is the last thing we needed," Fernanda said to herself, "An anarchist right in our house."</t4204><t4205>Two weeks later, the strike broke out and did not cause the tragic consequences that people had feared.</t4205><t4206>The workers only demanded not to cut and transport bananas on Sundays, and this demand was so reasonable that even Father Antonio Isabel joined in because he saw it as in line with God's laws.</t4206><t4207>The success of this strike, along with several other activities that occurred in the following months, made José Arcadio Segundo, an obscure person whom people often said was good for nothing but filling the village with modern prostitutes, become famous.</t4207><t4208>With the same resolute determination he had shown in killing all his fighting cocks to build a plan to open a waterway from Macondo to the world, he resigned from his position as foreman of the banana company to side with the workers.</t4208><t4209>He was immediately suspected of being a member of an international organization against public order.</t4209><t4210>In the sad week following the pessimistic rumors, one night he narrowly escaped death from four pistol bullets fired at him by a stranger as he stepped out of a secret meeting.</t4210><t4211>The political atmosphere in the following months was so tense that even Úrsula, sitting in the dark, could feel it, and she had the sensation of reliving the unhappy days when her son, Colonel Aureliano Buendía, always carried homeopathic pills from a rebellious organization in his pocket.</t4211><t4212>She wanted to talk to José Arcadio Segundo to understand what had happened before, but Aureliano Segundo informed her that since the night he narrowly escaped being shot, no one knew where he was staying.</t4212><t4213>"He's just like that Aureliano Buendía," she exclaimed. "It's as if time is going in circles."</t4213>
<t4214>In those hazy days, Fernanda often lived isolated from the outside world.</t4214> <t4215>She lost contact with the outside world ever since the fierce argument with her husband over unilaterally deciding Meme's fate without his consent.</t4215> <t4216>Aureliano Segundo was ready to search for his daughter, even if it meant involving the police, but Fernanda showed him documents confirming that their daughter had voluntarily entered a cloistered convent.</t4216> <t4217>Indeed, Meme had signed those papers when she was already inside the iron gates of the convent, signing with the same indifference with which she had let herself be taken there.</t4217> <t4218>In his heart, Aureliano Segundo did not believe the documents were legitimate, just as he never believed that Mauricio Babilonia had snuck into the backyard to steal chickens, but the papers gave him peace of mind, allowing him to leisurely return to the shadow of Petra Cotes.</t4218> <t4219>He resumed organizing noisy parties and indulging in lavish feasts.</t4219> <t4220>Living detached from the worries of the people and deliberately ignoring Ursula's terrible predictions, Fernanda tightened the final screws of her meticulously crafted plan.</t4220> <t4221>She wrote a long letter to her son José Arcadio, who was about to receive minor orders, informing him that his sister Meme had gone to serve God after coughing up black blood.</t4221> <t4222>Afterward, she left little Amaranta Ursula in the care of Santa</t4222> <t4223>Sophia de la Piedad and resolved to resume correspondence with the invisible doctors, tormented by Meme's misfortune.</t4223> <t4224>The first thing she did was set a definite date for the telepathic treatment.</t4224> <t4225>But the invisible doctors replied that during the turmoil in Macondo, it was not the right time for such actions.</t4225> <t4226>Being too confused and out of touch with reality, she explained in another letter that there was no social instability in Macondo, that all the commotion was the result of her brother-in-law's mad endeavors, just as he had once killed all the fighting cocks in a rage and rushed to open a river route from Macondo to the world.</t4226> <t4227>Thus, they still had not reached an agreement.</t4227> <t4228>On a hot Wednesday, an old nun carrying a basket arrived at the house and knocked on the door.</t4228> <t4229>Upon opening the door, Santa Sophia de la Piedad thought it was a gift and was about to embrace the basket covered with a precious silk cloth.</t4229> <t4230>But the nun stopped her in time, having been instructed to hand it directly to Fernanda del Carpio de Buendía.</t4230> <t4231>It was Meme's son.</t4231> <t4232>Fernanda's former confessor explained in a long letter that the boy had been born two months earlier and was named Aureliano after his grandfather, as the mother had refused to reveal her final wishes.</t4232> <t4233>Fernanda was very upset by this mockery of fate but still had enough strength to retort in front of the nun:</t4233>
<t4234>- We will spread the news that we found this boy lying in a basket floating on the river.</t4234>
<t4235>- No one will believe that, ma'am, - the nun said.</t4235>
<t4236>- If you believe in the Bible, - Fernanda retorted, - then why don't you believe me when I say that!</t4236>
<t4237>The nun ate lunch at home while waiting for the train to return and agreed to keep a promise that everyone demanded of her, which was to never mention the boy again. However, Fernanda asserted that the nun was an unwelcome witness to her shame and regretted that the medieval custom of hanging bearers of bad news had been abolished.</t4237> <t4238>That was also when she decided she would drown the boy in the bathtub right after the nun left her house, but her heart did not allow her to do so, and she had to patiently wait until the infinite kindness of God would free her from this burden.</t4238>
<t4239>When little Aureliano had just turned one, the social situation suddenly became tense.</t4239><t4240>José Arcadio Segundo and some union officials, who had been operating secretly until now, made an untimely appearance to organize several demonstrations in the villages belonging to the banana company.</t4240><t4241>The police, following orders from above, closely monitored them daily.</t4241><t4242>But on the second night, the union officials were arrested right in their homes, shackled with five-kilogram chains, and then imprisoned in the provincial jail.</t4242><t4243>Among those arrested were José Arcadio Segundo and Lorenzo Gavilán, a colonel of the Mexican revolution currently exiled in Macondo, who often proudly claimed that he was a witness to the heroism of Artemio Cruz, a close friend of his.</t4243><t4244>However, within less than three months, they were released; because the government and the banana company could not agree on who should feed them in prison.</t4244><t4245>This time, the workers' protests were based on the following factors: housing that did not ensure the health of the workers, hypocritical medical services, and very unfair working conditions.</t4245><t4246>Additionally, the workers asserted that the company did not pay them in cash but in coupons (vouchers) that could only be used to buy Virginia ham in the company's commissary stores.</t4246><t4247>José Arcadio Segundo was arrested because he had proven that the wage payment in coupons was merely an economic ploy by the company to sustain its fruit-carrying ships.</t4247><t4248>If there were no goods for the commissary stores, those ships would have had to run empty from New Orleans to the ports to pick up bananas.</t4248><t4249>As for the other crimes, everyone knew about them.</t4249><t4250>The company's doctor did not examine the sick but merely lined them up in front of the clinic, and a nurse placed a copper sulfate-colored pill on their tongues, regardless of whether they had malaria, gonorrhea, or constipation.</t4250><t4251>This treatment method was so common that children sometimes lined up several times, and instead of taking the pills, they brought them home to play with.</t4251><t4252>The workers lived crammed in shabby huts.</t4252><t4253>Instead of building public latrines, on Christmas occasions, the company's technicians brought in mobile latrines for fifty people and even instructed how to use them for longevity.</t4253><t4254>Old, decrepit lawyers dressed in black, who previously clung to Colonel Aureliano Buendía to bother him, now represented the banana company, using their deceitful judgments like magic tricks to bail out the banana company.</t4254><t4255>When the workers united to draft a single petition with common demands, these demands were not officially submitted to the banana company for a long time.</t4255>
<t4256>When Mr. Brao heard the news about the new petition from the workers, he immediately attached his luxurious glass-roofed carriage to the train and, along with the permanent representatives of the Company, quickly disappeared from Macondo.</t4256><t4257>However, the workers managed to catch one of those representatives right at a certain brothel and forced him to sign a copy of the petition while he was still stark naked with a woman.</t4257><t4258>This woman had voluntarily used her charms to lure him into the trap.</t4258><t4259>In a court session, the despondent lawyers argued that this person had nothing to do with the Banana Company, and to ensure no one doubted their argument, the lawyers ordered his imprisonment for impersonation.</t4259><t4260>Not long after, Mr. Brao was caught during an inspection trip on a third-class carriage, and the workers made him sign another copy of the petition.</t4260><t4261>The next day, he appeared before the judges with dyed black hair and spoke Spanish very fluently.</t4261><t4262>The lawyers then explained that this person was not Mr. Jack Brao, the General Manager of the Banana Company, born in Britvin, Alabama, but merely a mild-mannered drug seller born and residing in Macondo, named Dugoberto Fonseca.</t4262><t4263>Not long after, to counter the workers' new actions, the lawyers displayed an obituary at public places, certified by the consul and American diplomats, stating that Mr. Brao had been run over by a fire truck on a street in Chicago on the ninth of June.</t4263><t4264>Fed up with these absurd explanations, the workers ignored the authorities in Macondo and filed a lawsuit with the Supreme Court.</t4264><t4265>It was here that the judges, adept at twisting words and manipulating the law like circus performers, declared that the workers' complaints were entirely baseless, simply because the Banana Company did not, never had, and never would have workers, only temporary laborers.</t4265><t4266>Thus, in this way, the lawyers overturned the workers' petition exposing the deceit about Virginia ham, the bizarre pills, and the mobile latrines that only appeared during Christmas, and the Court ruled and solemnly announced the non-existence of the workers.</t4266>
<t4267>The general strike broke out.</t4267> <t4268>The banana plantations were abandoned, bananas lay at the roots, and trains with one hundred and twenty cars stopped right in the middle of the tracks... Workers left their jobs and flooded into the town.</t4268> <t4269>Turkish Street became unusually bustling.</t4269> <t4270>The billiard room in the Giacop hotel stayed open for more than four hours straight to welcome guests.</t4270> <t4271>José Arcadio Segundo was there on the very day the news came that the army had been ordered to restore public order.</t4271> <t4272>Although he was not a person with premonitions, that news to him was an omen of the death he had been waiting for since that distant morning when Colonel Gerineldo Márquez took him to witness an execution.</t4272> <t4273>However, that ominous sign did not make him uneasy.</t4273> <t4274>He played billiards and did not miss a single shot.</t4274> <t4275>Afterward, the sound of drums, brass instruments, shouting, and the commotion of the crowd informed him that everything had finally ended, including the billiard game and the solitary and silent game he had been playing with himself since the morning of the execution.</t4275> <t4276>He stepped out onto the street and saw the soldiers.</t4276> <t4277>It was a regiment of three battalions, marching to the beat of drums, shaking the ground.</t4277> <t4278>The stench emanating from the regiment was like the breath of a multi-segmented dragon, clouding the clear midday sky.</t4278> <t4279>All the soldiers were short, stocky, and coarse.</t4279> <t4280>They were drenched in horse sweat, smelled like rotting meat left in the sun, and were as fierce as prairie men.</t4280> <t4281>Even though they had been marching for over an hour, people still thought that the regiment was just a few companies marching in circles, because the soldiers looked identical, like children of the same mother, with the same dull expressions.</t4281> <t4282>They carried heavy backpacks and canteens, brazenly brandished bayoneted rifles, bore the frustration of blind obedience, and the complex of honor.</t4282> <t4283>From her darkened bed, Úrsula heard the soldiers march by and made the sign of the cross.</t4283> <t4284>Santa Sofía de la Piedad stood still for a long time, bent over the freshly ironed cloth, thinking of her son, José Arcadio Segundo, whom she had just seen pass by the Giacop hotel door without fear in front of the last soldiers of that regiment...</t4284>
<t4285>The martial law order granted the military the authority to act as arbitrators in this dispute, but the military showed no intention of reconciliation.</t4285> <t4286>The military quickly deployed throughout Macondo. The soldiers put down their guns in one place, then spread out to cut bananas, load them onto cars, and move the trains.</t4286>
<t4287>The workers, who until now had been silently waiting, rushed up the mountain carrying nothing but their machetes, their work tools, and began to reclaim what had been taken from them.</t4287> <t4288>They set fire to the warehouses, the Company's trust stores, destroyed the railway tracks to stop the passage of trains that had begun to clear the way with machine gun fire, and they cut the electric and telephone lines.</t4288> <t4289>The trenches of the banana plantation were stained with blood.</t4289> <t4290>Mr. Brao, who lived in a chicken coop-like apartment complex with electric wiring, along with his family and some of his compatriots, had been secretly taken out of Macondo to a safe place under the protection of the army.</t4290> <t4291>The tense general situation threatened to develop into an uneven and bloody war, especially when the authorities issued a call for the workers to gather in Macondo. The call stated that the provincial governor would arrive on Friday, ready to resolve this conflict.</t4291>
<t4292>José Arcadio Segundo stood in the crowd that had gathered at the train station since Friday morning.</t4292> <t4293>He had attended the union officials' meeting and was assigned, along with Colonel Gavilan, to mingle with the large masses to lead them according to the specific circumstances.</t4293> <t4294>He was not feeling very well and, moreover, his mouth was bitter as if he had swallowed a bitter pill when he learned that the army had placed machine gun emplacements around the station, and he also knew that the company's building with barbed wire had been protected by cannons.</t4294> <t4295>It was nearly twelve noon, and due to waiting for the train that did not arrive, more than three thousand people, including workers, children, and women, had crowded the station and spilled over into the adjacent streets blocked by machine guns.</t4295> <t4296>The scene resembled a bustling fair more than a festive gathering.</t4296> <t4297>The food stalls and refreshment stands on Turkish Street had been moved elsewhere, and the public patiently and cheerfully endured the inconvenience of waiting under the scorching sun.</t4297> <t4298>A little before three o'clock, there was a rumor that the official train might not arrive until the next day.</t4298> <t4299>The weary crowd sighed in disappointment.</t4299> <t4300>At that moment, an army lieutenant climbed onto the roof of the station where four machine guns were lined up, pointing towards the crowd.</t4300> <t4301>A brass bugle sounded, signaling the crowd to be silent.</t4301> <t4302>Standing next to José Arcadio Segundo was a fat barefoot woman with two children, one four years old and the other seven.</t4302> <t4303>She carried the younger child and, although they were strangers, she asked him to hold the older one so that the child could hear what was about to be said.</t4303>
<t4304>Hose Arcadio Segundo carried the boy on his shoulders.</t4304> <t4305>In the many years that followed, the boy would recount repeatedly, though no one believed him, that he had seen a lieutenant read Decree Number Four through a loudspeaker, signed by Colonel Carlos Cortés Vargas and Major Enrique García Isaza, the secretary of the governor.</t4305> <t4306>With three clauses comprising about eighty words, Decree Number Four labeled the strikers as a band of thieves and thus ordered the military to shoot them.</t4306>
<t4307>The decree has been read out.</t4307> <t4308>Amidst the whistles and boos of the crowd, a captain stepped out to replace the lieutenant.</t4308> <t4309>He stood on the roof of the station, took the loudspeaker, and signaled that he wanted to speak.</t4309> <t4310>The crowd fell silent again.</t4310>
<t4311>- Ladies and gentlemen, - the captain said in a low, slow voice, sounding somewhat tired.</t4311> <t4312>- I order you to disperse within five minutes.</t4312>
<t4313>The whistling and shouting rose again, drowning out the sound of the brass horn used to mark that five-minute interval.</t4313> <t4314>However, no one moved.</t4314>
<t4315>- It's been more than five minutes.</t4315> <t4316>- he said in the same tone as before.</t4316> <t4317>Extend it by one more minute, and if you don't disperse, the army will open fire.</t4317>
<t4318>José Arcadio Segundo broke out in a cold sweat.</t4318> <t4319>He stopped carrying the boy on his shoulders and handed him back to his mother, "These old goats might actually shoot, no joke," the mother whispered.</t4319> <t4320>José Arcadio Segundo didn't have time to say anything, because at that moment he recognized the voice of Colonel Gavilan encouraging everyone to shout in unison the very words that the woman had just uttered.</t4320> <t4321>Deeply moved by the tense situation, by the profound and miraculous silence, and especially by the realization that no force could sway the massive crowd ready to face death, José Arcadio Segundo stood on tiptoe, rising above the heads in front of him, and for the first time in his life, he spoke out:</t4321>
<t4322>- To hell with those old goats! We don't need that moment at all!</t4322>
<t4323>When he finished shouting, an event occurred, and this event did not frighten him but only brought him an illusion.</t4323> <t4324>The captain ordered to open fire, and thus all fourteen machine gun nests responded to him with gunfire.</t4324> <t4325>However, he felt that all of this was just a farce.</t4325> <t4326>It seemed as though those guns were firing fireworks, because although the deafening explosions were heard by everyone, although the scorching hot bullets were seen flying out rapidly by everyone, there was still no reaction from the crowd, not even a sigh or a cry, the crowd remained as still as stone.</t4326> <t4327>Suddenly, next to the station, a choked cry of "Oh, mother" broke that aura.</t4327> <t4328>A boiling force of an earthquake, a scorching breath of a volcano, a roaring of a storm erupted right in the center of the crowd with a miraculous rapid deployment. José Arcadio Segundo barely had time to scoop up the boy, while the mother and his sibling were swallowed up by the chaotic crowd.</t4328>
<t4329>Many years later, even though the neighbors still believed he was just a clown, that boy continued to tell that José Arcadio Segundo had lifted him over his head and let him glide, as if in the air, over the horror of the crowd pouring towards one of the nearby streets.</t4329> <t4330>From that high position, the boy saw the chaotic crowd starting to rush towards a corner, and it was on this street, at that very moment, that the machine guns also began to fire.</t4330> <t4331>Then the people in the front row fell down under the sweeping burst of gunfire.</t4331> <t4332>The survivors, instead of lying down, hurriedly pushed each other back towards the train station.</t4332> <t4333>At that moment, the terror descended upon them with bursts of machine gun fire like the tail of a dragon lashing at them, driving them into a dense stream of people clashing with another dense stream of people also pushing towards a different road.</t4333> <t4334>This stream was also being fired upon by machine guns facing them, raining bullets like another lash of the dragon's tail.</t4334> <t4335>The strikers were encircled, spinning wildly like a giant whirlwind whose center was gradually narrowing as the outer rings of this whirlwind were being sliced by the sharp blade of machine gun fire, peeling them away like an onion.</t4335> <t4336>The boy saw a woman kneeling, her arms folded in the shape of a cross, standing in a clean patch of ground that was miraculously kept free from the crowd.</t4336> <t4337>Before the crowd filled that empty space, José Arcadio Segundo had placed the boy down there, and right at that spot, with his face covered in blood, he fell beside the kneeling woman, under the blazing light from the high sky during the sunny season, in the mystical world where Úrsula Iguarán once sold wonderful candies shaped like little animals.</t4337>
<t4338>When he woke up, José Arcadio Segundo was lying on his back in the dark.</t4338> <t4339>He realized that he was lying on a long, silent train, that his hair was matted with dried blood, and his whole body, his bones, ached as if they had been beaten.</t4339> <t4340>He felt an unbearable sleepiness.</t4340> <t4341>Intending to sleep a long sleep to get through the horror and terror, he turned to the side that hurt less, and only then did he discover that he was lying on top of dead people.</t4341> <t4342>There was not a single open space in the car, except for the main aisle.</t4342> <t4343>The massacre might have happened a few hours ago, because these bodies were already as cold as kaolin in autumn, and those who had arranged these corpses in the car had had time to stack them in an orderly manner, just like bunches of bananas being transported by train.</t4343> <t4344>Trying to escape the heavy atmosphere, José Arcadio Segundo crawled from car to car in the direction the train was moving, and by the light filtering through the gaps between the planks as the train passed sleeping villages, he saw the bodies of men, the bodies of women, the bodies of children that would soon be dumped into the sea like discarded bananas. He only recognized a woman who sold refreshments at the station and Colonel Gavilan, who was still holding the silver-buckled belt from Morelia that he used to carve his way through the horror.</t4344> <t4345>When he reached the first car, he jumped off the train, hid in the darkness, and lay still for a long time in a ditch waiting for the train to pass.</t4345> <t4346>It was an unprecedentedly long train of about two hundred freight cars, each end hooked to a locomotive and another one in the middle.</t4346> <t4347>It had no lights, not even the green and red signal lights, and it sped through the silent night.</t4347> <t4348>On the roof of the cars, the dark shapes of soldiers with machine guns ready to fire stood out.</t4348>
<t4349>In the middle of the night towards dawn, a heavy rain shower poured down.</t4349> <t4350>José Arcadio Segundo didn't know where he had jumped off, but he was certain that by walking in the opposite direction of the train, he would reach Macondo. After more than three hours of walking, thanks to the dawn light, he recognized the first roofs; by then, he was soaked to the bone and had a terrible headache.</t4350> <t4351>Drawn by the aroma of coffee, he stepped into a kitchen; he saw a woman holding a child, bending over the fire.</t4351>
<t4352>- Hello, ma'am, - he said.</t4352> <t4353>- I am José Arcadio Segundo Buendía, right?</t4353>
<t4354>He stated his full name, clearly enunciating each word so that the listener would recognize that he was still alive.</t4354> <t4355>He did something very timely because his mother almost thought he was a ghost when she saw a haggard figure at her doorstep, with hair and clothes matted with blood, and was certain that this figure had just brushed against the might of death.</t4355> <t4356>His mother recognized him and brought him a cloak to wear temporarily while waiting for his wet clothes to dry completely by the stove.</t4356> <t4357>Then she gave him hot water to clean his wound, which was actually just a superficial scratch, and also gave him a piece of cloth to bandage his head.</t4357> <t4358>After that, she gave him a cup of black coffee without sugar, as people often told her: those of the Buendía family only drank that kind of coffee.</t4358>
<t4359>José Acadio Segundo quietly drank all the coffee.</t4359>
<t4360>- Perhaps up to three thousand people, no less, - he muttered.</t4360>
<t4361>- What is that?</t4361>
<t4362>- The dead people, - he said.</t4362> <t4363>- Perhaps everyone present at the station was shot dead.</t4363>
<t4364>With a look of pity, the mother looked at him questioningly.</t4364> <t4365>"Here, not that many people died," she said, "Since the time of the late Colonel, that young man of his, nothing has happened in Macondo."</t4365> <t4366>Before returning to his own home, José Arcadio Segundo visited three families, and each one told him the same thing: "Not that many people died."</t4366>
<t4367>He crossed the platform, saw the food stalls piled up on each other, and right here he also did not see any trace of the massacre.</t4367><t4368>Under the heavy rain, the streets were silent and deserted, all the houses were tightly closed, with no sign of life inside.</t4368><t4369>Only the church bell calling the faithful to mass was the sole human activity.</t4369><t4370>Stopping right at Colonel Gavilan's door, he called out.</t4370><t4371>A pregnant woman, whom he had met many times, upon seeing him, immediately slammed the door shut.</t4371><t4372>"Not here," she replied with a look of fear: "gone back to the countryside."</t4372><t4373>The main gate leading into the compound, surrounded by barbed wire as usual, was guarded by militiamen in raincoats and pith helmets, standing like stone statues in the rain.</t4373><t4374>On their small streets, the black people from Antidat were singing hymns in unison.</t4374><t4375>José Arcadio Segundo jumped over the fence in front of the house and entered through the kitchen.</t4375><t4376>Santa Sofía de la Piedad could only exclaim, "Don't let Fernanda see you."</t4376><t4377>She said, "She just got up."</t4377><t4378>As if by an unspoken agreement, she took her son to the room with the chamber pots, fixed the wobbly bed of old Melquíades for him to use, and at two in the afternoon, while Fernanda was taking her nap, she handed her son a plate of rice through the window.</t4378>
<t4379>Aureliano Segundo stayed at home because an unexpected downpour kept him there, and until three in the afternoon, he was still waiting for the rain to stop.</t4379> <t4380>Because he was secretly informed by Santa Sofía de la Piedad, he visited his twin brother in the room of Melquíades at this hour.</t4380> <t4381>He also did not believe the story about the massacre or the heavy-laden ship carrying the dead towards the sea.</t4381> <t4382>The night before, a special bulletin had been read to inform everyone that the workers had obeyed the order to disperse from the station and had formed peaceful groups to return to their homes.</t4382> <t4383>The bulletin also stated that the union leaders, with a high spirit of patriotism, had reduced their demands to two points: improving medical services and constructing latrines in the workers' camps.</t4383> <t4384>It was further announced that when the military officials received the workers' petition, they urgently informed Mr. Brown, and that he not only approved the new demands but also allocated funds for a three-day celebration to mark the resolution of the conflict... The only trouble was that when the soldiers asked him when they could announce that the petition had been signed, he looked at the sky streaked with lightning through the window and made an indecisive gesture:</t4384>
<t4385>- When the rain stops, - he said.</t4385> <t4386>- We will suspend all activities while it is still raining.</t4386>
<t4387>It had been three months without rain and it was now the dry season.</t4387><t4388>But when Mr. Brao announced his decision, a downpour spread across the Banana Company region, and José Arcadio Segundo was caught in the rain on his way back to Macondo.</t4388><t4389>A week later, it was still raining.</t4389><t4390>The official explanation, repeated thousands of times and spread by the government, made everyone believe that no one had died, the workers had contentedly returned to their families, and the Banana Company had ceased all operations during the rain.</t4390><t4391>The curfew law continued to be enforced to prepare for the need to implement emergency measures to prevent general damage caused by the relentless rain, and the army remained stationed in Macondo.</t4391><t4392>During the day, the soldiers, with their pants rolled up to their thighs, walked through the streets where water flowed like a torrent, playing a game of rescuing drowning people with the children.</t4392><t4393>At night, after the curfew signal sounded, they searched every house, using rifle butts to break down doors, arresting suspects in their beds and making them disappear.</t4393><t4394>That was the period of hunting down and eliminating the remaining "troublemakers," "murderers, arsonists," punished by Decree No. 4, but the soldiers denied their own acts of arrest and killing to the relatives of the victims when they came to the command offices for information.</t4394><t4395>"It must have been just a dream," the officers said. "Nothing terrible like arrests and killings has happened, is happening, or will ever happen in Macondo.</t4395><t4396>This is a happy town."</t4396><t4397>That was how they finished off the union leaders.</t4397>
<t4398>The sole survivor was José Arcadio Segundo.</t4398> <t4399>One February night, the unmistakable sound of rifle butts banging on the door suddenly echoed on the porch.</t4399> <t4400>Aureliano Segundo, who had been waiting for the rain to stop to leave, opened the door to six soldiers under the command of an officer.</t4400> <t4401>Soaked with rain, silently, they thoroughly searched the house: room by room, cabinet by cabinet, from the living rooms to the pantry.</t4401> <t4402>Úrsula woke up when the room lights were turned on, and she did not sigh mournfully while the soldiers searched, but she kept her fingers making the sign of the cross directed towards the soldiers at work.</t4402> <t4403>Santa Sofía de la Piedad had managed to warn José Aureliano Segundo, who was sleeping in Melquíades' room, but he understood that it was too late to escape now.</t4403> <t4404>So Santa Sofía de la Piedad locked the room door again, and he dressed, put on his shoes, and sat on the bed waiting for them to come.</t4404> <t4405>Meanwhile, the soldiers were searching the jewelry workshop.</t4405> <t4406>The officer ordered the latch to be opened and, with the beam of his flashlight swiftly scanning the room, he saw the worktable, the glass cabinet with bottles of acid and the tools still in place as their owner had arranged them, and it seemed he understood that no one was in that room. However, cunningly, he asked Aureliano Segundo if he was a jeweler, and he replied that the room used to be Colonel Aureliano Buendía's jewelry workshop.</t4406> <t4407>"Ah ha," the officer cleared his throat, then he turned on the light and ordered a thorough search of the room, so meticulous that the eighteen unfinished goldfish stored in a tin box hidden behind the acid bottles could not escape their notice.</t4407> <t4408>The officer carefully inspected each one on the worktable, and at this point, he was entirely benevolent. "I would like to take one if you agree," he said. "There was a time when these goldfish were a symbol of the rebels, but now they are a relic."</t4408> <t4409>He was very young, almost still in his teens, with a natural friendliness that only now became apparent.</t4409> <t4410>Aureliano Segundo gave him a goldfish.</t4410> <t4411>The officer put it in his shirt pocket, and the others he placed back in the tin box and returned the box to its original place.</t4411>
<t4412>- That is a priceless memento, - he said.</t4412> <t4413>Colonel Aureliano Buendía is one of our great men.</t4413> <t4414>However, that fleeting moment of humanity did not change his usual behavior.</t4414> <t4415>In front of the room of old Melquiades, which had just been locked again, Santa</t4415> <t4416>Sofía de la Piedad turned to her last hope.</t4416> <t4417>"Sir, for nearly a century, no one has lived in this room," she said.</t4417> <t4418>The officer still ordered the door to be opened, he shone his flashlight around the room, Aureliano Segundo and Santa</t4418> <t4419>Sofía de la Piedad saw the Arab eyes of José Arcadio Segundo when the flashlight beam hit his face, and they understood that it marked the end of one suffering and the beginning of another, which could only be consoled by patient endurance.</t4419> <t4420>But the officer continued to search the room with his flashlight, showing no sign of interest until he saw the seventy-two chamber pots on the shelves.</t4420> <t4421>Then he turned on the light.</t4421> <t4422>José Arcadio Segundo was sitting on the edge of the bed, ready to leave, more solemn and thoughtful than ever.</t4422> <t4423>Further inside were the bookshelves with books whose spines were peeling, rolls of parchment, and the writing desk that was still tidy and clean, with fresh ink in the inkwell.</t4423> <t4424>The room retained its fresh and airy atmosphere, maintaining its honor against dust and decay, as Aureliano Segundo had seen in his youth and which only Colonel Aureliano Buendía could not see.</t4424> <t4425>But the officer only paid attention to the chamber pots.</t4425>
<t4426>- How many people live in this house? - he asked.</t4426>
<t4427>- Five people.</t4427>
<t4428>Clearly, the officer did not understand.</t4428> <t4429>He stopped his gaze at the place where Aureliano Segundo and Santa</t4429> <t4430>Sofía de la Piedad were intently looking at.</t4430> <t4431>It was the place where José Arcadio Segundo was sitting, and he also understood that the officer was looking at him without seeing him.</t4431> <t4432>Then he turned off the light and closed the room door.</t4432> <t4433>When he talked to the soldiers, Aureliano Segundo understood that the officer had looked at the room with the same eyes that Colonel Aureliano Buendía once had.</t4433>
<t4434>- Indeed, no one has lived in that room for at least a century - the officer said to the soldiers.</t4434> <t4435>- There are probably only venomous snakes in there.</t4435>
<t4436>As the door of the room closed, José Arcadio Segundo clearly realized that his war was over.</t4436><t4437>Years before, Colonel Aureliano Buendía had spoken to him about the joy of war and had intended to prove it with countless examples drawn from his own life experiences.</t4437><t4438>He had believed him.</t4438><t4439>But that night, when the soldiers looked at him without seeing him, thinking about the tense situation of the recent months, the hardships in prison, the horrors at the train station, and the train carrying the dead, José Arcadio Segundo concluded that Colonel Aureliano Buendía was nothing more than a clown or a coward.</t4439><t4440>He did not understand that he had to use too many words to describe what he felt in the war, not knowing that just one word was enough to express it.</t4440><t4441>That word was fear.</t4441><t4442>In contrast, in Melquíades' room, protected by supernatural light, by the sound of the rain, and by the feeling of being invisible, José Arcadio Segundo lived in a rest he had never had before, with a lingering fear that he would be buried alive.</t4442><t4443>He shared this with Santa Sofía de la Piedad, who brought him food twice a day, and she promised him that she would live until her strength gave out to ensure that he would be buried only when he was truly dead.</t4443><t4444>Freed from all fears, José Arcadio Segundo buried himself in reading Melquíades' parchments, and the more enthusiastically he read, the less he understood them.</t4444><t4445>Having become accustomed to the constant rain, which after two months had become a new form of tranquility, the only thing that disturbed his solitude was the comings and goings of Santa Sofía de la Piedad.</t4445><t4446>So he asked her to leave his food on the window sill and lock the door from the outside.</t4446><t4447>The others in the family had forgotten him, including Fernanda, who disapproved of him living there when she knew that the soldiers had looked at him without seeing him.</t4447><t4448>When José Arcadio Segundo had been locked in the room for six months, and now that the soldiers had withdrawn from Macondo, Aureliano Segundo unlatched the door to find someone to talk to while waiting for the rain to stop.</t4448><t4449>Upon opening the door, he was overwhelmed by the stench from the chamber pots full of excrement and urine placed on the floor.</t4449><t4450>José Arcadio Segundo, suffering from skin sores, unaware of the gloomy scene caused by the rain, was still engrossed in reading the incomprehensible writings on the parchments.</t4450><t4451>He was illuminated by a beam of angelic light.</t4451><t4452>It seemed that as soon as he looked up when he heard the door open, that glance was enough for his twin brother to see the inherent fate of their great-great-grandfather repeated in him.</t4452>
<t4453>- More than three thousand people, - that is all Hôsê Accađiô Sêgunđô said.</t4453> <t4454>- Now I am absolutely certain that those were all the people present outside the station.</t4454>
<t4455>Chapter 16</t4455>
<t4456>Rain for four years, eleven months, and two days.</t4456><t4457>There were times when the drizzle was so persistent that everyone wore ceremonial clothes and put on a solemn face to pray for the rain to stop, but soon people got used to the brief dry spells that foretold even more prolonged rains to come.</t4457><t4458>The sky seemed to break open in a thunderous storm, and from the north, gales came, tearing off roofs, toppling walls, and sweeping away the last remaining vines in the fields.</t4458><t4459>Just like during the insomnia plague that Ursula now recalled, it seemed this calamity had come to punish them with a monotonous life.</t4459><t4460>Aureliano Segundo was one of those who worked the hardest to avoid falling into idleness.</t4460><t4461>He returned home to take on some chores on the night when Mr. Brown summoned the storm that caused the rain and wind, and Fernanda found him an old umbrella in a cupboard. "No need," he said, "I'll stay here until the rain stops."</t4461><t4462>Of course, it wasn't a promise set in stone, but he did exactly that.</t4462><t4463>Since his clothes were all at Petra Cotes' house, he changed his outer clothes every three days and wore shorts until his laundry dried.</t4463><t4464>To avoid boredom, he threw himself into repairing countless broken things around the house: sometimes fixing a hinge, oiling a lock, tightening screws, or straightening nails.</t4464><t4465>For several months, he was seen wandering around the house with a set of tools left behind by the gypsies since the time of old José Arcadio Buendía, and no one knew if he did it out of a reluctant need to stay active, because the winter made him bored, or because he forced himself to indulge in moderate play.</t4465><t4466>He became so passionate about working that his once-bulging belly shrank, wrinkling like a piece of leather, and his once-handsome, turtle-like face lost its charm, his sagging chin firmed up until he was less obese and could bend down to tie his shoes again.</t4466><t4467>As she watched him fix hinges and dismantle clocks, Fernanda wondered if her husband was also afflicted with the compulsion to create and destroy, like Colonel Aureliano Buendía making goldfish, like Amaranta sewing buttons and weaving shrouds, like José Arcadio Segundo reading the inscriptions on parchment, and like Ursula reminiscing about her life.</t4467><t4468>But it wasn't quite like that.</t4468><t4469>The worst part was that the rain changed everything; even the driest machines grew moldy if left unoiled for three days, steel wires and copper nets rusted, and wet clothes grew green moss.</t4469><t4470>The air was so damp that fish could swim through it to enter the house through the front door and exit through the windows.</t4470><t4471>One morning, Ursula woke up feeling faint and demanded to be taken to Father Antonio Isabel even if she had to be carried on a stretcher, and at that moment, Santa Sofía de la Piedad saw leeches all over her back.</t4471><t4472>They had to use red-hot embers to detach each leech before they sucked all her blood.</t4472><t4473>They had to dig many trenches to drain the water from the house and sweep away the toads and snails to dry the floors, remove the bricks under the bed legs, and once again wear shoes indoors.</t4473><t4474>Absorbed in the many small tasks that fascinated him, Aureliano Segundo didn't realize he was aging until one afternoon when he found himself sitting in a rocking chair, watching the early evening with indifference, thinking of Petra Cotes.</t4474><t4475>Nothing prevented him from returning to the tepid love of Fernanda, whose beauty had now faded behind the maturity of age, but the rain had freed him from all sudden passions and instilled in him a calm, unexcited love.</t4475><t4476>He enjoyed the incessant rain that had lasted almost a handful of years, thinking about the things he could have done in the past when he was one of the first to bring corrugated iron to Macondo, before the banana company made it fashionable, and he used it only to roof Petra Cotes' bedroom, relishing the intimate feeling it gave him as the rain pattered on it.</t4476><t4477>But even the wild memories of his youthful debauchery couldn't cheer him up.</t4477><t4478>In his most recent binge, he had lost his lustful enthusiasm.</t4478><t4479>All that remained was the indifferent joy of organizing feasts.</t4479><t4480>One might think that the flood had given him time to reflect, and the small tasks with pliers and oil cans had awakened in him a late regret for the practical trades he could have pursued but never did in his life, regretting that none of them were concrete, because the desire to sit still and the household chores that once stimulated him were not the result of thoughtful contemplation nor a learned lesson.</t4480><t4481>That nostalgia was unearthed by the rainy season, coming to him from far away, from the days he sat reading in Melquíades' room about the legendary tales of flying carpets and giant whales swallowing ships.</t4481><t4482>Those were also the days when little Aureliano appeared on the porch due to Fernanda's negligence, and his grandfather learned of his origins.</t4482>
<t4483>He cut its hair, dressed it, taught it to get used to crowds, and soon the boy had the appearance of a true Aureliano Buendía: the same high cheekbones, the same startled look, the same air of solitude.</t4483> <t4484>For Fernanda, it was a respite.</t4484> <t4485>She had once considered her great honor but had not yet found a way to explain it, because the more she thought about the solutions, the less convincing they seemed.</t4485> <t4486>Knowing that Aureliano Segundo would handle everything as he had, with all the delight of a grandfather, she no longer monitored and forbade the boy as strictly as before. On the contrary, since last year, she had freed him from humiliation. For Amaranta Úrsula, who had now lost her baby teeth, the grandson was like a toy that could run and jump, providing her with amusement amid the dreary rain.</t4486> <t4487>At this moment, Aureliano Segundo remembered the English encyclopedia in Meme's bedroom.</t4487> <t4488>First, he showed the kids pictures, especially those of animals, then he showed them maps and pictures of distant and ancient countries, and great figures.</t4488> <t4489>Since he did not know English and was familiar only with the most well-known cities and frequently mentioned figures, he made up names and mythical stories to satisfy the children's curiosity.</t4489>
<t4490>Fernanda truly believed that her husband was waiting for the rain to stop so he could return to his lover's house.</t4490> <t4491>During the first months of rain, she feared that he would sneak into her bedroom and that she would die of shame having to let him know that she was completely incapable of satisfying his desires ever since giving birth to Amaranta Úrsula.</t4491> <t4492>That was the reason for her fervent correspondence with unseen doctors, a relationship that was frequently interrupted by the unreliable postal service.</t4492>
<t4493>In the early months, upon learning that the train had derailed due to storms, a letter from the unseen doctors informed her that all her letters had been lost and never reached them.</t4493><t4494>Later, when all correspondence with the distant recipients was completely cut off, she seriously considered wearing the tiger mask that her husband had worn at the bloody Carnival ball, using a pseudonym to seek medical help from the banana company doctors.</t4494><t4495>But one of the people who regularly brought news of misfortunes from the flood informed her that the banana company had ceased all its welfare operations in Macondo to move to a drier region.</t4495><t4496>Thus, she lost all hope.</t4496><t4497>She resolved to wait until the weather cleared and the mail service resumed normally, and in the meantime, to console herself, she soothed her silent pains, for she had vowed that she would rather die than fall into the hands of the only practicing doctor in Macondo, a bizarre Frenchman who lived on herbs typically used to feed donkeys.</t4497><t4498>She approached Úrsula, believing that the hundred-year-old woman might know of some remedy to alleviate her debilitating pains.</t4498><t4499>But her habit of not calling things by their proper names led her to use mixed concepts to avoid embarrassment; instead of saying "in front," she said "behind"; instead of talking about childbirth, she talked about excretion; instead of mentioning dizziness, she spoke of a burning sensation.</t4499><t4500>Thus, the conceptual confusion in describing her clinical symptoms led Úrsula to the plausible conclusion that the pains were not uterine but intestinal, and she advised her to fast and take a laxative.</t4500><t4501>If it weren't for the shameful nature of her condition and the loss of her letters, the rain would have meant nothing to Fernanda, for ultimately, life for her was as dreary as the incessant downpour.</t4501><t4502>She did not change her schedule nor neglect her prayer sessions.</t4502><t4503>Even when the dining table had to be propped up on stacked bricks, and the chairs placed on planks to keep the diners' feet dry, she still laid out linen cloths and set the table with the Chinese porcelain dinnerware, and at dinner, she still lit the candles, for she believed that calamity was no excuse for abandoning customs.</t4503><t4504>No one dared to look out onto the street.</t4504><t4505>If it had been up to Fernanda, they would never have looked out onto the street, not just since the rain began but long before, as she believed that doors were made to keep the house closed, and curiosity about street happenings was a vice of the lowly.</t4505><t4506>However, she was the first in the family to peek out when the funeral procession of Colonel Gerineldo Márquez was announced, though what she saw through the slightly open window brought her to a state of shame, regretting her weakness for a long time.</t4506>
<t4507>Never had there been a funeral more sorrowful than this one.</t4507> <t4508>The coffin was placed in a banana leaf hut set on a bullock cart, but because of the heavy rain and muddy roads, with each step the wheels got stuck and the hut wobbled, almost collapsing.</t4508> <t4509>The mournful raindrops fell on the coffin, gradually soaking the flag draped over it, a flag stained with blood and dust from the long march, which had been rejected by the most honorable veterans.</t4509> <t4510>On the lid of the coffin lay a sword with silk tassels, the very sword that Colonel Gerineldo Márquez had hung on the coat rack in the living room before stepping into Amaranta's sewing room.</t4510> <t4511>Behind the bullock cart were the last survivors of the signing of the Treaty of Neclandia, some barefoot, all with their pants rolled up to their knees, wading through the mud, one hand holding a cane, the other carrying paper wreaths faded by the rain.</t4511> <t4512>They appeared like unreal images on the road still named after Colonel Aureliano Buendía, all looking at the Buendía house as they passed, then turning at the square where they had to ask for help because the cart got stuck.</t4512> <t4513>Úrsula had been escorted to the door by Santa</t4513> <t4514>Sofía de la Piedad.</t4514> <t4515>She attentively followed every detail of the funeral procession, so much so that no one doubted she was watching, especially since her holy arm kept pointing at the procession.</t4515>
<t4516>- Goodbye, my son Herinendo, - he shouted.</t4516> <t4517>- Say goodbye to my loved ones for me and tell them that we will meet when the weather clears up.</t4517>
<t4518>Aureliano Segundo helped the old man back to bed and, with his usual teasing attitude, asked him the meaning of his earlier farewell.</t4518>
<t4519>- It's true, the old man said.</t4519> <t4520>- I'm just waiting for the weather to clear up so I can die.</t4520>
<t4521>The scene on the streets made Aureliano Segundo come to his senses.</t4521> <t4522>Worried too late about the fate of the livestock, he donned a raincoat and hurried to Petra Cotes' house.</t4522> <t4523>He found her in the yard, waist-deep in water, trying to push a dead horse away.</t4523> <t4524>Aureliano Segundo grabbed a ladder to help her push the carcass, and the enormous bloated body spun around before being swept away by the muddy current.</t4524> <t4525>Since the rain began, Petra Cotes had done nothing but drive the dead animals away from her yard with the water.</t4525> <t4526>In the first weeks, she sent messages to Aureliano Segundo urging him to return, but he replied that there was no hurry, that the situation was not yet serious, and that he would think of another solution when the rain stopped.</t4526> <t4527>She informed him that the pastures for the horses were flooded, that the livestock had fled to higher ground where they were starving and falling prey to tigers and diseases.</t4527> <t4528>"There's no need to do anything," Aureliano Segundo replied to her: "When the rain stops, they'll reproduce in abundance, don't worry."</t4528> <t4529>Petra Cotes had seen the livestock die in droves and could barely manage to dispose of the stranded carcasses.</t4529> <t4530>With a sense of helplessness, she bitterly watched the flood mercilessly destroy an entire fortune, a fortune that was once considered the largest and most secure in Macondo, now reduced to a foul stench.</t4530> <t4531>When Aureliano Segundo decided to return to see what had happened, he found only the carcass of a stallion and a skinny mare still alive, trapped in the ruined stable.</t4531> <t4532>Petra Cotes saw him return without any shock, joy, or sadness, and moreover, she almost gave a mocking smile:</t4532>
<t4533>- Right on time, - she said.</t4533>
<t4534>She had grown old and frail, her bones protruding, her eyes green like a cat's, becoming more melancholic and gentle from watching the rain.</t4534> <t4535>Aureliano Segundo stayed at her house for three whole months, not because he felt more comfortable there than at his own home, but because it took him that long to decide to put on the oilcloth again and return home. "There's no need to hurry," he said as he used to say at home, "we'll wait for the rain to stop in the next few hours."</t4535> <t4536>During the first week, he gradually got used to the deterioration that time and the incessant rain had caused to his lover's health, and gradually he began to see her as she once was, recalling her carefree joys and the wild fertility that her love had stimulated in the livestock. Then one evening in the second week, partly out of love and partly out of pleasure, he bargained to wake her up.</t4536> <t4537>Petra Cotes remained indifferent, unenthusiastic.</t4537> <t4538>"Go back to sleep," she whispered, "These days are not the time for us to frolic."</t4538> <t4539>Aureliano Segundo looked at himself in the mirror mounted on the ceiling, saw Petra Cotes's back with her pitifully protruding ribs, and understood that she was right, not because of time, but because they were now past their prime.</t4539>
<t4540>Aureliano Segundo carried his belongings back home, firmly believing that not only Úrsula but all the inhabitants of Macondo were waiting for the rain to stop so they could die.</t4540> <t4541>As he passed by, he saw them sitting in their living rooms with vacant eyes, holding their heads in their hands, listening to the passage of time—a complete, unspent time, for it was pointless to divide it into years, months, and days when all they could do was watch the rain fall.</t4541> <t4542>The children cheered Aureliano Segundo because he would play the worn-out accordion for them.</t4542> <t4543>But the concert did not captivate the children as much as the encyclopedia sessions, so the father, children, and grandchildren gathered in Meme’s bedroom, where Aureliano Segundo’s imagination turned the hot air balloon into a flying elephant looking for a place to sleep among the clouds.</t4543> <t4544>Once, he came across an image of a man on horseback, and despite the strange clothes the man wore, he recognized the familiar figure. After careful examination, he concluded it was a portrait of Colonel Aureliano Buendía.</t4544> <t4545>He showed it to Fernanda, and she also noticed that the rider not only resembled the Colonel but all the members of their family, even though it was actually a portrait of a Tartar warrior.</t4545> <t4546>And so he let time pass while looking at the statue of Rhodes and the fascinating pictures of snakes, until his wife informed him that there were only six kilos of salted meat and a sack of rice left in the pantry.</t4546>
<t4547>- So, what do you want me to do now? - he asked.</t4547>
<t4548>- I don't know, - she replied.</t4548> <t4549>- That is a matter for men.</t4549>
<t4550>- Alright, - said Aureliano Segundo.</t4550> <t4551>- We'll do something when the rain stops.</t4551>
<t4552>He was more engrossed in reading the encyclopedia than worrying about daily meals, even when he had to be content with eating dog meat and a little rice for lunch.</t4552><t4553>"Indeed, there's nothing that can be done right now," he said. "But it can't rain all the time."</t4553><t4554>And while he delayed worrying about the urgent need for food, Fernanda's outbursts grew more intense, including rare curses and profanities that flowed in an unstoppable torrent, starting early in the morning like the monotonous prelude of a guitar, and escalating in volume and melody as the day progressed, becoming more harmonious and captivating.</t4554><t4555>Aureliano Segundo did not fully grasp the melodious curses until the next day, after breakfast, when he was irritated by a buzzing sound that now drowned out the rain, and it was Fernanda, who was pacing around the house lamenting that her parents had raised her like a queen only for her to end up as a servant in a house full of mad people, with a lazy, promiscuous husband who always lay on his back waiting for things to fall into his mouth while she had to work herself to the bone to maintain a nearly bankrupt family, a place that required much work, endurance, and reorganization from dawn till bedtime, leaving her eyes sore and aching, yet no one ever asked her if she slept well, not even out of courtesy, nor did anyone ask why she looked so pale or why her eyes were so dark-circled, even though she did not expect, of course, that such words would come from anyone in a family that always saw her as an obstacle, a nuisance, a monkey painted on the wall, and that the whole family spoke ill of her everywhere, calling her a hypocrite, a liar, a gecko, and even Amaranta, now resting in peace, harshly called her a dung beetle, God forgive, what terrible words, and she had endured it all with patience for the sake of the Holy Father's intentions, but she could no longer bear it when José Arcadio Segundo maliciously said that the family's ruin was due to letting a spy in, imagine that, oh Lord, a tyrannical spy, oh Lord, a spy with lowly blood, akin to the government agents sent to shoot workers, tell her, and who else could that refer to but her, the adopted daughter of the Duchess of Alba, a noble lady who bore presidents' wives, a true aristocrat who could sign with eleven illustrious surnames from Spain, and she was the only one in the village of bastards who felt proud of the sixteen place settings on the table, only for her niece to laugh and say that such an array of cutlery was not for God's children but for serpents, and she was the only one who could close her eyes and know when to serve colored wine, from which side, into which glass, unlike the rustic Amaranta, now resting, who thought white wine was for daytime and colored wine for night, and she was the only one in the coastal region who used a golden chamber pot instead of squatting like others, so much so that later Colonel Aureliano Buendía, now resting, with his Freemason's bile, dared to ask her where her arrogance came from, as if she shat flowers instead of shit, imagine that, he said such words, and Renata, her own daughter, who accidentally saw her feces in the bedroom, replied that indeed the pot was golden with a crest but the contents were real shit, but worse than other shit, it was spy shit, imagine that, her own daughter, so she could never expect anything from this family, but she still had the right to expect some respect from her husband, because no matter how bad he was, he was her husband, her creator, her legal judge, the one who voluntarily took on the responsibility of taking her out of her parents' house, where she wove mourning hats from palm leaves, because her godfather sent Aureliano Segundo a handwritten letter with a ring seal, just to tell him that her foster daughter's hands were not made for mundane tasks but for playing the harpsichord, yet the foolish husband dragged her out with those instructions but exiled her to a hellish place where it was unbearably hot, and before she finished her purification rites, he packed his suitcase and the harpsichord and went to live with a wretched woman, who people said just by looking at her buttocks, yes, just by watching her sway her young mare's hips, one could tell she was a completely different kind of woman - a lady, - whether in a mansion or a stable, at the table or in bed, always a national lady, who revered God and was His slave and obeyed Him, and who could not be compared, of course, to tightrope dancers and wandering women who offered themselves to others, of course, who offered themselves to all men, like French-style prostitutes, or even worse, imagine that, because even French-style prostitutes had the decency to light a red lamp at the door to welcome guests, at least that, those women lacked no vice, imagine that, and they could not be compared to her, the only and cherished daughter of Doña Renata</t4555><t4556>Argote and Don Fernando del Carpio, first of all because he was a saint, a sheep among great sheep, a gentleman awarded the Order of the Holy Sepulchre, belonging to the class of people who received the divine privilege from God that their bodies would remain intact in the grave with smooth skin like a young girl in love and eyes bright and green as emeralds.</t4556>
<t4557>- That is not true, - Aureliano Segundo interrupted her, - When it was brought here, it was already rotten.</t4557>
<t4558>He had enough patience to listen to her scolding for an entire day until he caught a mistake that startled her.</t4558> <t4559>Fernanda did not heed him, but she had to lower her voice.</t4559> <t4560>That night, during dinner, Fernanda's ear-piercing scolding was drowned out by the sound of the falling rain.</t4560> <t4561>Aureliano Segundo ate very little, kept his head down, and got up to retire to his room quite early.</t4561> <t4562>At breakfast the next day, Fernanda was trembling with a tired appearance from a sleepless night and seemed completely shameless due to her anger.</t4562> <t4563>However, when her husband asked if he could have some hot eggs, she did not simply reply that they had run out of eggs since last week, but instead said she had written a vehement eulogy criticizing men who only care about their bellies and yet dare to demand to eat lark's liver.</t4563> <t4564>As usual, Aureliano Segundo took the children to look at the encyclopedia, and Fernanda pretended to tidy up Meme's room just to whisper to him alone: how shameless to tell the children that Colonel Aureliano Buendía's picture was in the encyclopedia.</t4564> <t4565>That afternoon, while the children were napping, Aureliano Segundo sat on the veranda, and Fernanda followed him out there, muttering insults like the buzzing of green flies to provoke him, to revile him, telling him that while the house had nothing left, not even stones to eat, her husband sat like a Persian king watching the rain fall, living off women and willing to marry the wife of Saint Jonah, who sat silently listening to the whale's tale.</t4565> <t4566>Aureliano Segundo did not move, like a deaf man, he listened to her scolding for two hours straight.</t4566> <t4567>He did not interrupt her, letting her scold until dusk, when he could no longer endure the incessant ringing that pained his head.</t4567>
<t4568>- Please, can you be quiet?</t4568>
<t4569>On the contrary, Fernanda raised her voice even more. "I have no reason to keep my mouth shut," she said. "Anyone who doesn't want to listen to me can just get out." At that moment, Aureliano Segundo could no longer control himself.</t4569> <t4570>He slowly stood up, as if just to stretch his muscles, and then, with a calm yet methodical fury, he began to pick up one pot after another—from begonias to ferns, from basil to other herbs—and threw each one onto the floor.</t4570> <t4571>Fernanda was terrified; because, in fact, she had not yet realized the inner strength of those curses, but when she did, it was too late, the situation could no longer be changed.</t4571> <t4572>Driven mad by the incessant cursing, Aureliano Segundo smashed the mirror of the glass cabinet, then calmly dismantled each part of the cabinet and smashed them. Following this order, with the same calm and harmony he had when pasting paper money on the walls, he shattered the Bohemian glassware, the fake flowers, the paintings of virgins standing on boats filled with roses, the mirrors framed in gold leaf, and everything else that could be broken from the house to the pantry. Finally, he ended by smashing the water jar with a deep, resonant crash.</t4572> <t4573>After that, he wiped his hands, wrapped himself in an oilcloth, and left. Before midnight, he returned with several vats of salted meat, sacks of rice and corn, and bunches of bananas.</t4573> <t4574>From that moment on, the house never lacked food.</t4574>
<t4575>Perhaps Amaranta Úrsula and little Aureliano would remember this flood as a time of great happiness.</t4575> <t4576>Despite Fernanda's constant strictness, the children still splashed around in the yard, hunting lizards to cut them open and playing a game of poisoning the soup by adding butterfly dust if Santa Sofía de la Piedad wasn't watching carefully.</t4576> <t4577>Úrsula was the most interesting toy for the children.</t4577> <t4578>They treated her like an old doll to be decorated: smearing her face with soot and red dye, tying colorful fabric scraps on her, and carrying her around the corners of the room, almost using garden shears to gouge out her eyes as they had done with toads.</t4578> <t4579>Nothing delighted them more than her rambling words.</t4579> <t4580>Indeed, since the third year of the flood, something unusual had happened in her mind, as she gradually lost her sense of current reality, confusing the present with distant periods of her life, until she wept bitterly for three days over the death of Petronila Iguarán, her great-grandmother, who had been buried nearly a century ago.</t4580> <t4581>She sank into such a bizarre state of confusion that she believed this little Aureliano was her son, the colonel, at the time when he was taken by his father to see ice, and that José Arcadio, who was studying to become a Pope, was her firstborn son, who had left home to follow the gypsies.</t4581> <t4582>She talked so much about her family that the children memorized the names to organize imaginary outings for her with people who were not only long dead but also from different periods.</t4582> <t4583>Sitting on the bed with hair as gray as ash and a red scarf covering her face, Úrsula was truly happy living among the family members imagined and described by the children in such detail, as if they really knew them.</t4583>
<t4584>Ursula talked with her elders about events that had occurred before she was born, she rejoiced at the news they gave her, and then she wept with them for those who had recently died more than for those who were already dead and talking to her.</t4584> <t4585>It wasn't long before the children learned that during those imaginary outings, Ursula always asked a question to determine who, during the war, had brought a life-sized plaster statue of Saint Joseph to the house for the family to take care of through the stormy season.</t4585>
<t4586>Thanks to this, Aureliano Segundo remembered the treasure buried somewhere that only Úrsula knew, but all his questions and every cunning trick he could think of to probe Úrsula proved useless, because while wandering through the mysterious corners of her delirium, Úrsula always maintained a spark of intellect to protect the secret she intended to reveal only to someone who could prove themselves the true owner of the carefully hidden gold.</t4586> <t4587>She was so astute and clever that when Aureliano Segundo orchestrated one of his drinking buddies to pose as the owner of the buried treasure and brought him to meet his great-grandmother, he failed before a series of meticulous, trap-laden questions from her.</t4587>
<t4588>Because he believed that Úrsula would take this secret to her grave, Aureliano Segundo hired a team of workers under the pretext of digging drainage ditches for the front and back yards, and he himself used a pickaxe and metal detectors to dig everywhere but found no evidence of gold in three months of fruitless excavation.</t4588> <t4589>Then, believing that the cards saw more clearly than the workers' eyes, he hurried to see Pilar Ternera; but the old woman also warned him that he would not find it until after three years of continuous rain and drought had turned the mud into dust.</t4589> <t4590>The seemingly profound and unsubstantiated figures of that prediction made Aureliano Segundo feel that it was like an intelligent fable meant to make him stop his work and wait at least three more years to satisfy the prophecy's conditions.</t4590> <t4591>The first thing that surprised him and confused him even more was this fact: from Úrsula's bed to the fence in the backyard was exactly one hundred and twenty meters, just as Pilar Ternera had predicted.</t4591> <t4592>Fernanda feared that her husband was going mad like his twin brother when she saw him calculating intently, and even worse, when he ordered the workers to dig another meter deeper in the already dug ditches.</t4592> <t4593>Driven by a passion for the exciting excavations—a passion that could be compared to his great-great-grandfather's when he sought the path to great inventions—Aureliano Segundo grew thin, and thus his resemblance to his twin brother became even more pronounced, not only because of his emaciated appearance but also because of his distant demeanor and contemplative attitude.</t4593> <t4594>He did not care about the children.</t4594> <t4595>He ate at any time, even when he was covered in mud from head to toe, sitting in the corner of the kitchen and barely responding to Santa Sofía de la Piedad's casual questions.</t4595> <t4596>Seeing him work in such a grueling manner, something she had never dreamed he would do so fervently, Fernanda believed that his timidity was actually caution, that his greed was actually sacrifice, that his stubbornness was actually perseverance, and from the bottom of her heart, she regretted that the third-generation Arab still sat in the same place with the attitude of his ancestors, meaning contemplative, dignified, and unbothered by time and misfortune, living and dying as they had through the insomnia plague and the thirty-two civil wars of Colonel Aureliano Buendía.</t4596> <t4597>Their healthy and steadfast spirits amidst the decay of chessboards, eateries, shooting galleries, and the alley where people went to have their fortunes read and dreams interpreted were so astonishing that Aureliano Segundo, with his usual flippant attitude, had to ask by what mystical means they had not drowned in the recent flood, as if some devilish hand had helped them stay afloat, and one after another, from house to house, they all answered him with dreamy looks and sly smiles, saying the same thing: By swimming.</t4597> <t4598>- Perhaps Petra Cotes was the only local with an Arab heart. She witnessed the last pieces of her livestock pens being swept away by the flood, but she kept her house standing against the storms. In the final year of the flood, she reminded Aureliano Segundo to return quickly, and he replied that he would not return to her house, that she should forget about asking when he would come back, but that he would bring a chest of gold to pave her bedroom floor.</t4598> <t4599>So she tossed and turned, digging deep within herself to find the strength to survive this difficult period, and she found a carefully nurtured sense of resentment, both genuine and well-thought-out, with which she vowed to reclaim the wealth squandered by her lover and ruined by the flood.</t4599> <t4600>It was an unbreakable determination, so much so that eight months after her last message, Aureliano Segundo returned home to find her pale, disheveled, with sunken eyes and blotchy red skin from itching, yet still diligently writing numbers on small slips of paper for the lottery.</t4600> <t4601>Aureliano Segundo stood frozen, and because he was now also thin and solemn, Petra Cotes could not believe that the person who had come back to her was her lifelong lover and instead thought he was his twin brother.</t4601>
<t4602>- Am I crazy, - he said.</t4602> <t4603>- Do you intend to take out the white bones as a reward?</t4603>
<t4604>She hastily told him to look into the bedroom and Aureliano Segundo saw a female mule.</t4604> <t4605>It was emaciated, just skin and bones like its owner, but it was lively and determined like its mistress.</t4605>
<t4606>Pêtra Côtêt fed it with her own resentment, and when there was no more grass, corn, or tree roots left, she brought it into her bedroom, feeding it with fine linen bed sheets, Persian carpets, woolen blankets, felt mats, embroidered robes with gold thread, and even the silk tassels that decorated her Archbishop's bed.</t4606>
<t4607>Chapter 17</t4607>
<t4608>Ursula had to make a great effort to fulfill her vow to die when the weather cleared up.</t4608><t4609>The rare flashes of clarity that she experienced during the rainy days, which began in August, started to appear more frequently as dry winds blew in, suffocating the rose bushes and hardening the mud, scattering hot dust over Macondo, covering the rusty tin roofs and the century-old almond trees.</t4609><t4610>Ursula was saddened to realize that for more than three years she had been nothing but a plaything for the children.</t4610><t4611>She washed off the smeared makeup, discarded the colorful strings, the dried lizard and toad carcasses, and the fake and ancient Arab necklaces that had been draped around her; and for the first time since Amaranta's death, she got out of bed without assistance, to once again integrate herself into family life.</t4611><t4612>The indomitable will of her heart guided Ursula through the darkness.</t4612><t4613>Those who paused to let her stumble past and touched her arm, which felt like a saint's arm raised to head height, thought that she could hardly bear the weight of her body, but still did not believe that she was blind.</t4613><t4614>Without needing to see, Ursula knew that the carefully planted flower beds from the first reconstruction of the house had been ruined by rain and Aureliano Segundo's gold-digging, that the walls and cement floors were cracked, the furniture was faded and mossy, the doors were loose, and the family was threatened by a spirit of weakness and boredom that had never existed in the days when she was strong and steady: Groping through the empty bedrooms, Ursula recognized the continuous creaking of termites gnawing at the wood, the rustling of termites invading the wardrobes, and the terrifying rumble of the giant red ants that had multiplied rapidly during the flood, digging into the house's foundations.</t4614><t4615>One day, Ursula opened the chest containing the holy relics and had to ask Santa</t4615><t4616>Sofia de la Piedad to chase away the cockroaches that jumped out and covered her, having chewed up the clothes inside the chest. "We can't live in such neglect," Ursula said. "At this rate, those creatures will eat us alive."</t4616><t4617>From that time on, Ursula had no moment of peaceful rest.</t4617><t4618>She got up at dawn, demanding help from anyone, even the children.</t4618><t4619>She took out the few usable clothes to sun-dry, used insecticide to repel the cockroaches, sealed the termite holes in the doors and windows, and used quicklime to suffocate the ants in their nests.</t4619><t4620>The urge to repair the house led Ursula to the rooms where Jose Arcadio Buendia had strained his mind to create alchemical stones, reorganizing the jewelry workshop that had been disrupted by the soldiers, and finally, she demanded the key to Melquiades' room to see what condition it was in.</t4620><t4621>Faithful to Jose Arcadio Segundo's wish that no one enter the room until there was a sign of his death, Santa</t4621><t4622>Sofia de la Piedad used every trick to deceive Ursula.</t4622><t4623>But Ursula's determination to eradicate the pests even in the hidden and useless parts of the house was unyielding, overcoming all obstacles. After three days of persistent demands, Ursula forced everyone to open the room for her.</t4623><t4624>Ursula had to hold onto the doorframe to avoid falling from the stench, but within two seconds she remembered that seventy-two chamber pots of the female students were kept there, and recalled that on one of the first rainy nights, a patrol of soldiers had searched the house looking for Jose Arcadio Segundo but found nothing.</t4624>
<t4625>- God bless! - Ursula shouted as if she could see everything.</t4625> <t4626>- You stubbornly hold on to your good habits to the point that you live no differently than a pig.</t4626>
<t4627>José Arcadio Segundo continued to review the things recorded on the parchment sheets.</t4627> <t4628>One could only see in his tangled hair and beard those teeth full of green moss stains and his vacant eyes.</t4628> <t4629>Recognizing the voice of his great-great-grandfather, José Arcadio Segundo turned his head towards the window, tried to smile, and unintentionally repeated Ursula's ancient saying:</t4629>
<t4630>- What the hell for, - José Arcadio Segundo muttered, - time goes by anyway!</t4630>
<t4631>- That's right, - said Ucsula, - but not to that extent?</t4631>
<t4632>When she said that, Úrsula realized that she was repeating the words of Colonel Aureliano Buendía in the death row cell, and once again she shivered with the feeling that time did not pass but rather it circled back.</t4632> <t4633>But at that moment, she also did not concede.</t4633> <t4634>Úrsula scolded José Arcadio Segundo like a child and insisted that he bathe, shave, and contribute to the housework.</t4634> <t4635>José Arcadio Segundo was tormented.</t4635> <t4636>The simple thought of having to leave the room that had brought him peace terrified José Arcadio Segundo.</t4636> <t4637>He screamed that no one could make him leave this room because he did not want to see the two hundred-car train carrying the dead that every evening ran from Macondo to the sea.</t4637> <t4638>"Those are all the people outside the station," José Arcadio Segundo screamed, "three thousand four hundred and eight people."</t4638> <t4639>It was then that Úrsula realized that José Arcadio Segundo lived in a world shrouded in an even more incomprehensible fog than her own, a world as solitary and impenetrable as that of José Arcadio Buendía, his great-great-grandfather.</t4639>
<t4640>Ursula allowed Jose Arcadio Segundo to stay in that room, but she did not let others lock the door as before. She insisted on daily cleaning, throwing away the other chamber pots, leaving only one, and keeping Jose Arcadio Segundo always clean and presentable, just like his great-grandfather when he was tied under the chestnut tree.</t4640> <t4641>At first, Fernanda considered that state of excitement to be senility brought on by old age, and she struggled to control her irritation.</t4641> <t4642>But during that time, from Rome, Jose Arcadio informed her that he intended to return to Macondo before taking his vows for a lifetime of religious service, and that good news lifted Fernanda's spirits so much that she watered the flowers four times a day, from evening till morning, to ensure her son would not have a bad impression of the house.</t4642> <t4643>It was this excitement that led Fernanda to hastily write letters to the invisible doctors, rearrange the potted ferns, wild marjoram, and begonias in the hallway, before Ursula could find out that all those things had been smashed to pieces by Aureliano Segundo in a fit of terrible rage.</t4643> <t4644>After that, Fernanda sold the silver dinner sets and bought alloy cups and saucers; thus, with these items, she made the cabinets that once held Indian Company porcelain and Bohemian glassware grow poorer each day.</t4644> <t4645>Ursula always tried to go very far.</t4645> <t4646>"Open all the doors!" she shouted.</t4646> <t4647>"Cook dishes with meat and fish, buy the largest turtles; oh strange guests, come and spread your luggage in every corner, and feel free to pee in the rose beds, sit at the table and eat as many meals as you like, vomit and talk endlessly, wear boots and dirty everything, do whatever you want with us, because that is the only way to avoid ruin."</t4647> <t4648>But that was just an illusion.</t4648> <t4649>She was too old and had lived too long to recall the magical stories of the animal-shaped candies, and none of her descendants inherited her vigor.</t4649> <t4650>The house remained closed under Fernanda's orders.</t4650>
<t4651>After moving his belongings to Petra Cotes' house, Aureliano Segundo immediately sought a way to save the family from starvation.</t4651><t4652>With the proceeds from gambling with his mule, they bought some other animals and from there established a simple lottery.</t4652><t4653>Aureliano Segundo went from house to house selling lottery tickets he had drawn himself with colored ink to make them attractive and persuasive, unaware that many people bought those tickets just to give them away, and most bought out of pity.</t4653><t4654>But there were also those who bought tickets hoping for a chance: spending only twenty cents for a pig or thirty-two cents for a calf, these people were excited with hope, and on the third night, they crowded into Petra Cotes' yard, waiting for the moment when a randomly chosen child would draw the winning number from a bag.</t4654><t4655>Soon, the lottery became a weekly fair, as from the afternoon, eating and drinking spots were set up in the yard, and many of the lucky winners lost their prize animals to listen to music and drink, so, although unwillingly, Aureliano Segundo once again played the accordion and participated in small drinking parties.</t4655><t4656>These modest gatherings, compared to previous festivities, made Aureliano Segundo realize that his spirit had significantly declined and his exceptional singing and dancing skills had also deteriorated considerably.</t4656><t4657>He was a completely changed man.</t4657><t4658>When Aureliano Segundo was defeated by "The She-Elephant," he weighed one hundred and twenty kilos, but now he was down to seventy-eight; his face, once full like a turtle's shell, now looked gaunt like a chameleon's, and he always seemed weary and despondent.</t4658><t4659>But Petra Cotes had never seen Aureliano Segundo in better shape, perhaps confusing love with pity for him, and hardship had fostered a bond between them.</t4659><t4660>Now, the bed without curtains was no longer a place for orgies but a place for discussions and confidences.</t4660><t4661>The mirrors that once reflected their images had been sold to buy lottery prize animals, and the seductive silks had been eaten by the mule; they stayed up late with the clarity of two insomniac old people, calculating money, a time they previously wasted on exhausting themselves.</t4661><t4662>Sometimes, the first crow of the rooster startled them as they shuffled small stacks of money, taking a bit from here and adding a bit there to make sure one amount pleased Fernanda, another bought shoes for Amaranta Úrsula, another for Santa</t4662><t4663>Sofía de la Piedad, who hadn't had a new dress since the bankruptcy, another to pay for Úrsula's coffin when she died, another to buy coffee whose price increased by a cent every three months, another to buy sugar that grew less sweet each day, another to buy firewood still soaked from the flood, another to buy paper and ink for lottery tickets, and another to cover the loss of a cow that died in April because it got sick after all the lottery tickets had been sold, but luckily, they still managed to salvage the hide.</t4663><t4664>These "prayer" sessions were pure, always prioritizing Fernanda, not out of remorse or charity, but because Fernanda's assets were more important to them than their own.</t4664><t4665>The truth was that both, unbeknownst to each other, thought of Fernanda as the daughter they had always wished for but never had, to the point that once they endured eating corn cakes for three days to buy Fernanda a Dutch tablecloth. But despite their hard work, cunning schemes, and many tricks, their guardian angels had fallen asleep from exhaustion, while they kept adding and subtracting the money, striving to at least have enough to live on.</t4665>
<t4666>During sleepless nights due to painful calculations, they wondered what had happened in the world that made livestock less fertile than before, why money in hand kept dwindling, why not long ago people burned handfuls of money in folk dances, but now they consider buying a twelve-cent lottery ticket in hopes of winning six hens as a reckless act.</t4666><t4667>Aureliano Segundo thought to himself that the misfortune was not anywhere else in the world but in a deep, hidden place in the mysterious heart of Petra Cotes, where something had happened during the rainy days that made livestock infertile and money gradually disappear.</t4667><t4668>Worried about this mystery, Aureliano Segundo delved too deeply into Petra Cotes's emotions to the extent that in seeking profit, he found love, because while trying to make Petra Cotes love him, Aureliano Segundo himself fell in love with her.</t4668><t4669>As for Petra Cotes, she loved Aureliano Segundo because she felt he was more affectionate towards her every day, and thus, in the autumn of her life, Petra Cotes believed in the superstition of her youth that poverty was the supporter of love.</t4669><t4670>At that time, they regarded the wild festivities, the luxurious wealth, and the excessive indulgence as obstacles in life, and they regretted having wasted so much of their lives before finding the paradise of shared solitude.</t4670><t4671>They loved each other madly after so many years of being together without having children, they enjoyed their love in a strange way: loving each other while eating as well as while sleeping, and they were truly happy, until old age and exhaustion, they still played like rabbits and teased each other like dogs.</t4671><t4672>The lotteries never made them any better off.</t4672><t4673>At first, Aureliano Segundo spent three days a week locking himself in the room that used to be the cattle breeder's office to draw one ticket after another, carefully coloring a red cow, a green pig, or a blue chicken, which were the animals hung as prizes, and skillfully imitating the printed letters to make the template for the lottery ticket name, a name that Petra Cotes liked very much, "The Lottery of the Divine Almighty"... But then Aureliano Segundo felt too tired after drawing two thousand lottery tickets in a week, so he made a rubber template to print the animals, the lottery ticket name, and the numbers, and from then on, he only had to color them.</t4673><t4674>In the later years, they came up with the idea of replacing the numbers with riddles, so the prizes were shared among all those who guessed correctly, but this method was very complicated and caused much suspicion, so they eventually abandoned it.</t4674>
<t4675>Aureliano Segundo was busy reinforcing trust in his lottery, so he no longer had time to care for the children.</t4675><t4676>Fernanda enrolled Amaranta Úrsula in a small private school that accepted no more than six students, but she did not allow Aureliano to attend public school.</t4676><t4677>Fernanda believed that letting Aureliano out of his room was already a significant concession.</t4677><t4678>Moreover, at that time, schools only accepted children who were the legitimate offspring of Christian couples, and the birth certificate pinned to Aureliano's shirt when the servant brought him home clearly stated that he was an illegitimate child.</t4678><t4679>So the boy only lived confined to his room.</t4679><t4680>Due to the compassionate care of Santa</t4680><t4681>Sofía de la Piedad and the mental imbalance of Úrsula, Aureliano perceived the narrow world of this house through the explanations of these elderly women.</t4681><t4682>Aureliano was a slender, proud, curious boy, a kind of curiosity that easily angered adults, but his eyes sparkled absentmindedly, unlike the fierce and often blazing eyes of the colonel at his age. While Amaranta was at nursery school, Aureliano would catch worms and torment insects in the garden.</t4682><t4683>But one time, when Fernanda caught him stuffing scorpions into a box to place under Úrsula's mat, she immediately sent him back to Meme's old bedroom.</t4683><t4684>There, to shorten the lonely hours, he repeatedly looked through the illustrated pages of the encyclopedia.</t4684><t4685>One afternoon, when Úrsula was sprinkling cool water with a bundle of nettles to freshen up the house, she encountered Aureliano there, and although she had been beside him many times, she still asked him who he was.</t4685>
<t4686>- I am Aureliano Buendía, - he said.</t4686>
<t4687>- Oh, that's right, - the old man said, - it's time for you to start learning the jeweler's trade.</t4687>
<t4688>Ursula confused her uncle with her son because the hot winds that followed the days of flooding rains, which once brought her sudden flashes of clarity, had ceased to blow.</t4688> <t4689>Her lucidity did not recover.</t4689> <t4690>When entering the bedroom, Ursula encountered Petronila Iguaran wearing a cumbersome flared dress and carrying a small bag, waiting for guests to arrive as per the invitation, met her grandmother Tranquilina Maria Miniata Alacoque Buendia sitting on a chair for the paralyzed and fanning herself with a peacock feather, met her grandfather Aureliano Arcadio Buendia in a coat mimicking the style of the viceroy's guards, met her father Aureliano Iguaran, who had devised a spell to kill harmful cattle pests, met her timid mother, met her cousin with a pig's tail, met Jose Arcadio Buendia with his deceased children, all sitting on chairs lined up against the wall, as if they were at a wake rather than a social visit.</t4690> <t4691>Ursula, hastily sewing a colorful garment, discussed events occurring in different places and times; thus, when Amaranta Ursula returned from school and Aureliano was weary from the encyclopedia, they found her sitting on the bed talking to herself, immersed in a labyrinth of the dead.</t4691> <t4692>"Fire!", Ursula once screamed terrifyingly, causing the whole household to panic, but she was referring to a fire at a horse ranch forty years ago.</t4692> <t4693>In this manner, Ursula confused the past with the present, and until her death, although two or three times she had flashes of clarity, no one could be sure whether she was speaking of what she was experiencing or what she was remembering.</t4693> <t4694>Each day, Ursula became more emaciated, more gaunt, more withered, to the point that a few months before her death, she was like a plum lost in a loose dress, and the arms that once lifted high now resembled those of a monkey.</t4694>
<t4695>Ursula did not move for several days.</t4695> <t4696>Santa Sofia de la Piedad had to come to see if she was still alive and placed her on her lap to give her a few small spoonfuls of sugar water.</t4696> <t4697>At that moment, Ursula looked like an old woman who had just been born.</t4697> <t4698>Amaranta Ursula and Aureliano carried her from place to place in the bedroom and placed her on the altar to see if she was bigger than the infant Jesus, and one afternoon they hid her in a grain chest where the rats could eat her.</t4698> <t4699>One Sunday, while Fernanda was praying, Amaranta Ursula and Aureliano went into the bedroom, grabbed Ursula by the nape and ankles, and carried her away.</t4699>
<t4700>- Poor great-grandfather, - Amaranta Úrsula said, - he died of old age!</t4700>
<t4701>Ursula struggled:</t4701>
<t4702>- I'm still alive!</t4702>
<t4703>- See, - Amaranta Úrsula said, stifling a laugh, - even the breath is no longer there.</t4703>
<t4704>- I'm talking here! - Ursula shouted.</t4704>
<t4705>- Talk about what? - Aureliano said - The old man died like a little cricket.</t4705>
<t4706>At that moment, Úrsula had to give in.</t4706> <t4707>"Oh my God!", Úrsula cried silently: "So this is death".</t4707> <t4708>Úrsula began to recite prayers incessantly, hurriedly and deeply, the prayers lasting for more than two days, and on the third day they turned into a mix of prayers to God and practical instructions so that the red ants wouldn't destroy the house, so that the lamp in front of Remedios's picture would never go out, so that everyone would ensure that no one in the Buendía family would marry someone of the same bloodline, because such marriages would produce children with pig tails.</t4708> <t4709>Aureliano Segundo tried to take advantage of Úrsula's delirious state to get her to reveal the location of the buried gold, but once again those pleas were in vain. "When the owner of that gold appears," Úrsula said, "the sky will light up so that person can see it."</t4709> <t4710>Santa Sofía de la Piedad was convinced that Úrsula would die any day now, because during those days she had seen ominous signs from the heavens: roses smelled like saltwort, a squash containing green beans fell on her head and the beans on the floor formed a perfect geometric pattern in the shape of a starfish, and one night she saw a row of bright orange disks flying across the sky.</t4710>
<t4711>Ursula died early on Thursday morning, the day of the saint's feast.</t4711> <t4712>The last time someone helped her calculate her age, based on the years of the Banana Company, it was estimated that she had lived between one hundred fifteen and one hundred twenty-two years.</t4712> <t4713>They placed Ursula in a small box to take her for burial, a box that was probably no larger than the basket in which they had carried Aureliano home when he was newly born; and very few people attended Ursula's funeral, partly because few remembered her, and partly because it was so hot that noon, so hot that lost birds crashed into the walls, tearing the metal screens on the windows, flew into the bedrooms, and died there.</t4713>
<t4714>At first, people believed it was a plague.</t4714> <t4715>Housewives were exhausted from sweeping up bird corpses, especially at noon, while the men carted those bird corpses away and dumped them into the river.</t4715> <t4716>On Easter Sunday, from the pulpit, the hundred-year-old Father Antonio Isaben asserted that the birds had died due to the evil influence of the demon Giudio Erante, whom he had seen the night before.</t4716> <t4717>The father described it as a hybrid between a male goat and a heretical woman, a demon whose breath scorched the air, and wherever it went, newlywed women would lose their ability to conceive.</t4717> <t4718>Few paid attention to the father's apocalyptic sermon, believing that his old age had made him speak nonsense. But early Wednesday morning, a woman woke everyone up, claiming she had seen the tracks of a two-legged hoofed creature.</t4718> <t4719>The tracks were so clear and unmistakable that those who came to see them had no doubt about the existence of a fearsome creature exactly as the father had described, and they set traps in their gardens.</t4719> <t4720>And then they caught it.</t4720> <t4721>Two weeks after Ursula's death, Petra Cotes and Aureliano Segundo were startled awake by the sound of a calf crying nearby.</t4721>
<t4722>When they woke up, they saw a group of people removing the monster from the sharp stakes planted at the bottom of a pit covered with dry leaves on top.</t4722> <t4723>The creature could no longer make any sound.</t4723> <t4724>Although it was not taller than a child, it was as heavy as a cow, and from its wounds, a slimy green blood oozed out.</t4724> <t4725>Its body was covered with a thick layer of coarse fur, its skin hardened by a layer of compressed fish scales; but unlike the priest's description, the parts of its body resembled those of a frail god more than a human, for its hands were smooth and dexterous, its eyes wide open and hazy, and on its shoulders were calloused scars, the remnants of a pair of strong wings that had been chopped off with an axe.</t4725> <t4726>They tied its legs to an almond tree in the open field so everyone could see it, and when it began to rot, they burned it on a pyre because they couldn't determine whether its nature was that of an animal or a Christian, to decide the appropriate way to handle it: throw its body into the river or bury it.</t4726> <t4727>It was never certain whether it was truly responsible for killing those birds, but the number of newlywed women who did not conceive increased, and the heat did not subside.</t4727>
<t4728>Rebecca died at the end of that year.</t4728> <t4729>Argenida, who had served Rebecca all her life, sought help from the authorities to break open the bedroom door, where they found Rebecca lying on a solitary bed, her body curled up in a fetal position.</t4729> <t4730>Aureliano Segundo buried Rebecca and tried to renovate the house to sell it, but the house was so severely damaged that the walls crumbled immediately after removing the ivy that had ruined the pillars.</t4730>
<t4731>All the bankruptcies have occurred like that since the rain returned.</t4731><t4732>The laziness of everyone was evidenced by the merciless erosion of memories, to the highest degree during that time, on the occasion of the anniversary of the signing of the Neclandia agreement, when representatives of the President of the Republic came to Macondo to present the medal that Colonel Aureliano Buendía had repeatedly refused. They had to spend an entire afternoon looking for someone who could tell them where to find a descendant of the colonel.</t4732><t4733>Aureliano Segundo eagerly accepted the medal, believing it to be made of gold, but while the President's representatives were preparing the orchestra and speeches for the ceremony, Petra Cotes convinced him that doing so was disgraceful. Around the same time, the gypsies returned, the last inheritors of Melquiades' science. They found the village too desolate and the villagers too isolated from the outside world, so they went house to house dragging magnetized iron bars, as if these bars were the latest discovery of the wise men of Babylon. They used giant magnifying glasses to focus sunlight; and there were people who gaped at the overturned pots and pans rolling around, and many who paid fifty cents to marvel at a gypsy girl removing and replacing her false teeth.</t4733><t4734>A rickety yellow train that neither brought anyone nor took anyone away and hardly stopped at a deserted station was the only remaining image of a crowded train - where Mr. Brown kept a carriage with a glass roof and armchairs like those of a Cardinal - and of the fruit trains with one hundred and twenty cars that slowly passed through every afternoon.</t4734><t4735>Representatives of the court, investigating the strange deaths of birds and the death of the demon Giulio Erante, found Father Antonio Isabel playing blind man's bluff with the children. They believed his report was a product of senile delusion and sent him to a nursing home.</t4735><t4736>Not long after, Father Augusto Angel was sent.</t4736><t4737>He was a newly trained crusader, determined, brave, and daring. Every day, he rang the bell several times himself to keep his spirit from stagnating, going from house to house to wake up those who slept too much for mass; but within a year, he too succumbed to the impurities in the air, the hot dust that aged him prematurely and made walking difficult, and the meatball lunches in the unbearable heat that caused him to suffer from drowsiness.</t4737>
<t4738>Since Ucsula's death, the house fell into a state of neglect that nothing could remedy, not even the very persistent and strong will of Amaranta Ucsula, who many years later, being an open, cheerful, and fashionable woman, connected with the outside society, opened the doors to prevent the decline, renovated the garden, exterminated the red ants that dared to crawl out to the hallway in broad daylight, and tried to revive the forgotten spirit of hospitality.</t4738><t4739>The monastic-colored passion of Phecnanđa had erected a solid dam against the hundred-year turbulent life of Ucsula, which surged like a waterfall.</t4739><t4740>Not only did Phecnanđa not open the doors when the hot wind had passed, but she also bolted the windows with wooden bars, following the instructions of the holy father, thus burying herself in life.</t4740><t4741>The costly correspondence with the unseen doctors failed.</t4741><t4742>After many delays, at a suitable time, Phecnanđa locked herself in the bedroom, covered only with a white cloth, turned her head north, and at one o'clock in the morning, she felt someone place a cold wet cloth over her face.</t4742><t4743>When Phecnanđa woke up, the sun was shining through the window, and there was a seam running from her groin to her sternum.</t4743><t4744>But before carrying out the planned rest, Phecnanđa received a confusing letter from the unseen doctors, stating that they had examined her for six hours but found none of the symptoms she had meticulously described many times.</t4744><t4745>Indeed, Phecnanđa's habit of not calling things by their names was harmful; it was the source of a new misunderstanding because the surgeons only found that she had a prolapsed uterus, which could be treated with a pessary.</t4745><t4746>Phecnanđa wanted a specific announcement, but the unknown letter writers did not write to her again.</t4746><t4747>Worried about a strange word, Phecnanđa overcame her shyness and boldly asked what a uterine pessary was, but by then she learned that three months earlier, the French doctor had hanged himself from a beam and was buried by an old comrade of Colonel Aureliano Buendía, against the villagers' wishes.</t4747><t4748>Phecnanđa had to rely on her son, José Arcadio, who sent her pessaries from Rome along with instructions, which she memorized and hid to keep her illness a secret.</t4748><t4749>Such caution was futile because the people living in the house seemed unconcerned about it.</t4749><t4750>Santa Sofía de la Piedad lived in lonely old age, cooking for the whole house, and seemed to devote all her energy to caring for José Arcadio Segundo.</t4750><t4751>Amaranta Ucsula, who inherited the charms of Remedios the Beauty, devoted all her time to studying, which she previously wasted teasing Ucsula, began to show good sense and effort in her studies, reviving the good hopes that Meme had aroused in Aureliano Segundo.</t4751><t4752>Aureliano Segundo had promised to send her to Brussels to continue her studies, following the custom of the banana company era, and that dream made him strive to reclaim the land devastated by floods.</t4752><t4753>At that time, Aureliano Segundo was rarely seen at home.</t4753><t4754>He worked for Amaranta Ucsula, so to Phecnanđa, he had become a stranger. Meanwhile, Aureliano, as he reached puberty, became more reclusive and contemplative.</t4754><t4755>Aureliano Segundo believed that old age would soften Phecnanđa's heart so that Aureliano could integrate into the life of a village where no one would bother to investigate his origins. But Aureliano preferred to live in solitude and showed no interest in getting to know the world outside the door.</t4755><t4756>When Ucsula opened Melquíades' room, Aureliano hovered around, curiously looking at the half-closed door, and no one knew when the intimate relationship between him and José Arcadio Segundo began.</t4756><t4757>Much later, when he heard Aureliano talk about the massacre at the train station, Aureliano Segundo discovered that relationship.</t4757><t4758>One day at dinner, someone lamented the village's decline and immersion after being abandoned by the banana company, and Aureliano refuted that opinion with the maturity and speech of an adult.</t4758><t4759>According to his view, contrary to the general understanding, before being devastated, degraded, and then oppressed by the banana company, Macondo was a prosperous and rising region, and it was the banana company's engineers who caused the flood to find an excuse to cancel the workers' contracts.</t4759><t4760>When describing with precise and convincing details how the army shot over three thousand people trapped at the station and then used a two-hundred-car train to dump their bodies into the sea, Aureliano spoke so clearly that Phecnanđa felt as if he was irreverently imitating Jesus when he spoke to his apostles.</t4760><t4761>Like most others who believed in the official version that such an event did not happen, Phecnanđa became furious and forced Aureliano to stop speaking, thinking that he had inherited the anarchic vices of Colonel Aureliano Buendía.</t4761><t4762>In contrast, Aureliano Segundo accepted the opinion of his twin brother José Arcadio Segundo.</t4762><t4763>In fact, despite being considered insane, José Arcadio Segundo was the brightest in the house.</t4763><t4764>José Arcadio Segundo taught young Aureliano to read and write, guided him to start studying the records on the parchment, and deeply instilled in him his unique interpretations of the banana company's significance to Macondo, which many years later, when integrated into communal life, Aureliano still thought José Arcadio Segundo had told legendary tales because they differed entirely from the deceptive explanations accepted by historians and included in school lessons.</t4764><t4765>In the small room, where there was never dry wind, red dust, and heat, Aureliano and José Arcadio Segundo recalled the hereditary image of an old man wearing a crow's wing hat talking about the world behind the door many years before they were born.</t4765><t4766>Both realized that it was always March and always Monday there, and at that moment, they understood that great-grandfather José Arcadio Buendía was not as insane as the family had recounted, but was the only one in the family, with a fairly clear mind, who vaguely saw a truth that time could stumble and have accidents, thus it could shatter itself, leaving a piece eternally preserved in the room.</t4766><t4767>Moreover, José Arcadio Segundo also classified the codes written on the parchment.</t4767><t4768>José Arcadio Segundo asserted that those codes belonged to a script with forty-seven to fifty-two characters, which, when separated, looked like spiders and insects, and with Melquíades' meticulous writing, they resembled clothes hanging on a line.</t4768><t4769>Aureliano recalled seeing such a script in the British encyclopedia, so he brought his chart to the room to compare it with José Arcadio Segundo's chart.</t4769><t4770>The two charts were identical.</t4770>
<t4771>During the lottery period with riddles, Aureliano Segundo often woke up with a tight throat as if he were trying to hold back tears.</t4771> <t4772>Petra Cotes considered it one of the adversities brought about by bad circumstances, and for more than a year, she would apply a bit of honey to Aureliano Segundo's throat every morning and give him radish water to drink.</t4772> <t4773>When his throat swelled to the point of causing difficulty in breathing, Aureliano Segundo sought out Pilar Ternera to see if the old woman knew of any herbs that could cure it.</t4773> <t4774>The tough-minded grandmother, who had lived to be a hundred right in front of a secret brothel, did not believe in medicine but treated ailments by reading tarot cards.</t4774> <t4775>The old woman saw a golden horse wounded in the throat by the sword of the "J" and divined that Fernanda was trying to bring her husband back home with an ineffective spell by pinning his picture, but due to her ignorant understanding of the evil art, she caused her husband to develop internal boils.</t4775> <t4776>Since there were no other portraits except for the wedding photos, all of which were still in the family album, Aureliano Segundo continued to search the house whenever his wife wasn't looking, and finally, he found half a dozen uterine rings at the bottom of a clothes chest, still in their box.</t4776> <t4777>Believing those rings to be charms, Aureliano Segundo put one in his pocket and took it to Pilar Ternera.</t4777> <t4778>Pilar Ternera couldn't determine its nature, but full of suspicion, she told Aureliano Segundo to bring all half a dozen rings, and she burned them in a fire lit in the yard.</t4778> <t4779>To break Fernanda's spell, the old woman instructed Aureliano Segundo to wet a brooding hen and bury it under a chestnut tree; Aureliano Segundo followed her instructions with full faith, and immediately after covering the freshly dug spot with dry leaves, he felt relieved.</t4779> <t4780>Fernanda considered the disappearance of the uterine rings as the revenge of invisible doctors, so she sewed a small pocket inside her coat to hold the new rings her son sent her.</t4780>
<t4781>Six months after burying the chicken, one night in the middle of the night, Aureliano Segundo woke up because of a cough and felt as if crab claws were tearing inside him.</t4781><t4782>At that moment, Aureliano Segundo understood that even if he had a lot of rubber bands and soaked many brooding hens to break the spell, he still could not avoid the painful final truth that he was slowly dying.</t4782><t4783>Aureliano Segundo did not tell this to anyone.</t4783><t4784>Tormented by the worry that he might die before sending Amaranta Úrsula to study in Brussels, Aureliano Segundo worked harder than ever, and if he used to hold a lottery once a week, now he held three.</t4784><t4785>Early in the morning, Aureliano Segundo could be seen going everywhere in the village, even to the most remote and impoverished neighborhoods, trying to sell lottery tickets with a fervor that could only be seen in a dying man: "Here are the Almighty's sacred lottery tickets!" Aureliano Segundo proclaimed, "Don't miss out on a once-in-a-century chance."</t4785><t4786>Aureliano Segundo tried with touching effort, pretending to be cheerful, enthusiastic, and open, but just by looking at his sweat and pale face, one could tell he could not achieve his wish.</t4786><t4787>Sometimes Aureliano Segundo would turn into deserted fields, where no one could see him, and rest for a moment to alleviate the clawing pain inside.</t4787><t4788>At midnight, Aureliano Segundo was still in the brothel, trying to comfort the lonely women sobbing beside the hand-cranked phonographs with speeches about luck: "This number hasn't come up for four months!"</t4788><t4789>Aureliano Segundo said, holding out the lottery tickets: "Don't let luck slip away, because life is shorter than you think!"</t4789><t4790>Aureliano Segundo was no longer respected, people mocked him, and in his final months, they no longer called him Mr. Aureliano but directly to his face as "the Almighty."</t4790><t4791>Aureliano Segundo's voice became more and more hoarse, and finally, after a howl like a dog's, he lost his voice entirely, but Aureliano Segundo still hoped that his hope would not be extinguished in the lottery held in Petra Cotes's yard.</t4791><t4792>But because he lost his voice, Aureliano Segundo knew that soon he would not be able to endure the pain, and he realized that by holding lotteries with pigs and goats, his daughter could not go to Brussels, so he came up with the idea of holding a lottery with the prize being the land devastated by floods, which would be restored by the person who invested the most.</t4792><t4793>It was such an attractive initiative that the mayor himself, along with a band, went to advertise it, and people joined together to buy the lottery tickets at a price of one hundred pesos each, so the tickets were sold out in less than a week.</t4793><t4794>On the night of the lottery, the winners organized a grand celebration comparable to the best times of the banana company, and that night was the last time Aureliano Segundo performed the forgotten songs of old Francisco the Man on the accordion, as he could no longer sing.</t4794>
<t4795>Two months later, Amaranta Úrsula went to Brussels. Aureliano Segundo not only gave his daughter the money he had won in a special lottery but also his savings from the previous months and some money from selling the automatic piano, the small organ, and a few old items.</t4795><t4796>According to Aureliano Segundo's calculations, that capital was enough for Amaranta Úrsula to study, so only the money for the return ticket was missing.</t4796><t4797>Fernanda opposed the trip, irritated by the thought that Brussels was too close to the depraved city of Paris, but she finally felt at ease after reading a letter from Father Ángel to a boarding house for young Christians, run by devout women, where Amaranta Úrsula promised to stay until she finished her studies.</t4797><t4798>Moreover, the priest arranged for Amaranta Úrsula to travel with a group of Franciscan nuns who were going to Toledo, where they hoped to find a trustworthy person to take her to Belgium. While the arrangements were hurriedly made to coordinate everything, Aureliano Segundo, with the help of Petra Cotes, took care of packing Amaranta Úrsula's belongings.</t4798><t4799>On the evening they packed one of Fernanda's wedding trunks, everything was so meticulously prepared that the student Amaranta Úrsula could remember exactly where to find her formal dress and velvet slippers for crossing the Atlantic, and where to find the thick blue wool coat with brass buttons and the goatskin shoes for when she landed.</t4799><t4800>Amaranta Úrsula also knew how to walk without falling into the water when boarding, never to leave the nuns or her cabin on the ship except to eat, and not to answer any questions from anyone, whether men or women, while at sea.</t4800><t4801>She carried a bottle of seasickness medicine and a notebook with six prayers to ward off storms, written by Father Ángel himself.</t4801><t4802>Fernanda sewed her a canvas belt to hold money and instructed her on its use, telling her to always keep it on, even when sleeping.</t4802><t4803>Fernanda also intended to give her a small gold chamber pot that had been alkalized and sterilized with alcohol, but Amaranta Úrsula refused it, fearing her schoolmates would mock her.</t4803><t4804>Several months later, shortly before his death, Aureliano Segundo remembered the last time he saw Amaranta Úrsula, trying to lower the dusty windowpane of a second-class carriage to hear Fernanda's final instructions, but she couldn't lower it.</t4804><t4805>On the day she left, Amaranta Úrsula wore a pink silk dress with a small bunch of artificial flowers pinned to her left shoulder, low-heeled goatskin shoes with laces, and stockings with prominent rubber garters on her calves.</t4805><t4806>Amaranta Úrsula had a slender figure, long flowing hair, and lively eyes like Úrsula's when she was her age.</t4806><t4807>When saying goodbye, Amaranta Úrsula neither cried nor laughed, showing the same firmness as Úrsula's character.</t4807><t4808>Walking beside the carriage as the train started moving, holding Fernanda's arm to avoid tripping, Aureliano Segundo could still raise a hand in farewell when his daughter put her finger to her lips to send him a goodbye kiss.</t4808><t4809>Aureliano Segundo and his wife sat quietly under the scorching sun, watching the train until it was just a small dot on the horizon, and at that moment, for the first time since their wedding, they held each other's arms.</t4809>
<t4810>On the ninth of August, before any letters arrived from Brussels, José Arcadio Segundo was talking with Aureliano in Melquíades' room and suddenly said offhandedly:</t4810>
<t4811>- Always remember that they, more than three thousand people, were thrown into the sea!</t4811>
<t4812>Then José Arcadio Segundo collapsed onto the leather sheets full of writing and died with his eyes still wide open.</t4812> <t4813>At the same time, on Fernanda's bed, his twin brother no longer had to endure the prolonged pain as if caused by steel crab claws horribly clamping his throat.</t4813> <t4814>A week earlier, to fulfill the curse of dying beside his wife, Aureliano Segundo had returned home, unable to speak, unable to breathe, seemingly just skin and bones, bringing with him the trunks of a wanderer and an old accordion.</t4814> <t4815>Petra Cotes had helped him pack his clothes to bring back and had seen him off without shedding a tear, but she forgot to give Aureliano Segundo the leather boots he wanted to be placed in his coffin.</t4815> <t4816>Upon learning that Aureliano Segundo had died, Petra Cotes donned a black outfit and wrapped the boots in newspaper, seeking permission from Fernanda to visit the deceased.</t4816> <t4817>Fernanda did not allow Petra Cotes to step through the door.</t4817>
<t4818>- Put yourself in my place, - Petra Cotet said, - and imagine how much I must love him to endure this humiliation.</t4818>
<t4819>- There is no humiliation that is not worthy of a servant, - said Fernanda.</t4819> <t4820>- Just wait until another one of those men dies, so that you can put those boots in the coffin!</t4820>
<t4821>Keeping her promise, Santa</t4821> <t4822>Sophia de la Piedad used a kitchen knife to cut José Arcadio Segundo's throat to ensure he would not be buried alive.</t4822> <t4823>The two corpses were placed in identical coffins, and there they were seen to resemble each other as much as they had from birth to adulthood.</t4823> <t4824>The old drinking buddies of Aureliano Segundo placed a wreath on his coffin with a black ribbon bearing the inscription: "Cows, spread your legs, life is short!".</t4824> <t4825>Fernanda was very upset by this irreverence and ordered the wreath to be thrown into the trash.</t4825> <t4826>In the confusion of the final moments, as the two bodies were being taken out of the house, the drunken and sorrowful youths mixed up the coffins and thus buried each one in the other's grave.</t4826>
<t4827>Chapter 18</t4827>
<t4828>For a long time, Aureliano did not leave Melquiades' room.</t4828> <t4829>He memorized the mythical tales in the tattered book, the summaries of the works of Herman, a paralyzed man, the instructions on demonology, the essential points of alchemy, and the book of Nostradamus' prophecies and his studies on the plague, so when he reached adulthood, he knew nothing about his own era but had a basic knowledge of the Middle Ages.</t4829> <t4830>Whenever Santa</t4830> <t4831>Sofia de la Piedad entered that room, she always found him buried in books.</t4831> <t4832>She brought him a cup of unsweetened coffee in the morning and a plate of rice with a few slices of fried banana at noon, which was the only meal in the house since Aureliano Segundo's death.</t4832> <t4833>Santa Sofia de la Piedad took care of cutting Aureliano's hair, delousing him, mending old clothes from forgotten trunks for him to wear, and when she saw his beard starting to grow, she brought him Colonel Aureliano Buendía's razor and shaving brush. None of the Colonel's children, including Aureliano José, resembled him as much as Aureliano did, especially in the high cheekbones and the stern, slightly cruel lines of his mouth.</t4833> <t4834>Previously, Úrsula believed that Aureliano Segundo often talked to himself while studying in the room, and now Santa Sofia de la Piedad thought the same. In reality, Aureliano was talking to Melquiades.</t4834> <t4835>After the death of the twin brothers, on a sweltering afternoon, through the reflection of the window, Aureliano saw the mournful old man with the crow's wing hat, as if it were the concrete manifestation of a memory that had formed in his mind long before he was born.</t4835> <t4836>Before that, Aureliano had completed the classification of the script written on the parchment.</t4836> <t4837>When Melquiades asked Aureliano if he knew which language was inscribed on it, he replied without hesitation:</t4837>
<t4838>- Sanskrit.</t4838>
<t4839>Menkyađêt let Aureliano know that he wouldn't have many more chances to return to this room.</t4839> <t4840>But Menkyađêt calmly approached eternal death, because Aureliano had time to learn Sanskrit in the years before the parchment sheets turned a hundred years old and could be read.</t4840> <t4841>It was Menkyađêt who showed Aureliano that on the road leading to the riverbank, where during the Banana Company era people used to read fortunes and interpret dreams, in the bookstore of a wise man from Catalonia, there was a book called Sanskrit Primer that if Aureliano didn't buy quickly, would be eaten by termites in just six years.</t4841> <t4842>For the first time in many years of her life, Santa Sofía de la Piedad revealed an emotion, and it was one of astonishment, when Aureliano asked her to bring him the book lying between the Jerusalem Liberated and the poetry collection of Milton, on the far right of the second row of the bookshelf.</t4842> <t4843>Because she was illiterate, Santa</t4843> <t4844>Sofía de la Piedad memorized these instructions and raised the money by selling one of the seventeen goldfish left in the jewelry workshop, which only she and Aureliano knew where they had been hidden on the night the soldiers searched the house.</t4844>
<t4845>Aureliano made progress in learning Sanskrit, meanwhile, Melquiades became increasingly infrequent and distant, gradually blending into the dazzling midday light.</t4845> <t4846>The last time Aureliano felt his presence was when Melquiades seemed to be nothing more than an invisible shadow murmuring, "I died being strangled on the sand dunes by the coast of Singapore." At that moment, the room suddenly became defenseless against the onslaught of dust and heat, of termites and ants, of moths and cockroaches, the creatures that had turned the knowledge in books and those parchments into dust.</t4846>
<t4847>In the house, there was no shortage of food; the day after Aureliano Segundo died, one of his friends who had brought the wreath with the disrespectful inscription repaid Fernanda a debt he owed her husband.</t4847> <t4848>From that day on, a delivery person would bring a basket of food every Wednesday, enough for an entire week.</t4848> <t4849>No one ever knew that the food was sent by Petra Cotes with the thought that by prolonging her pity, she would torment the person who had once tormented her.</t4849> <t4850>But the hatred dissipated faster than even Petra Cotes had imagined, and she continued to send food out of pride, and later out of compassion.</t4850> <t4851>There were times when Petra Cotes did not want to sell lottery tickets anymore, and the people had lost interest in gambling; she would go without so that she could give food to Fernanda, and Petra Cotes always fulfilled her duty of sending food as long as Fernanda was alive.</t4851>
<t4852>For Santa Sofía de la Piedad, the reduction in the number of people in the house perhaps gave her a rest that she was entitled to after more than half a century of work.</t4852> <t4853>No one ever heard a complaint from that discreet and enigmatic woman, who had sown in this family the divine seeds of Remedios the Beauty and the mysterious solemnity of José Arcadio Segundo, who had devoted her entire lonely and silent life to raising children who could not clearly remember whether they were her children or grandchildren.</t4853> <t4854>She cared for Aureliano as if he had been born from her own labor, and she herself did not know that she was his great-grandmother.</t4854> <t4855>One had to be in such a family to think that Santa Sofía de la Piedad often slept on a mat woven from palm leaves laid on the floor of the grain storage room, amidst the croaking of frogs at night, and she did not tell anyone that one night she woke up with a horrifying feeling that someone was watching her in the dark, only to find that it was a venomous snake slithering over her belly.</t4855> <t4856>Santa Sofía de la Piedad knew that if she had told Úrsula about it in the past, Úrsula would have made her sleep in her own bed, but in these times no one paid attention to anything unless she cried out in the hallway, because the manual labor in the bakery, the horrors of war, and the care of children and grandchildren left no time to think about the happiness of others.</t4856> <t4857>Only Petra Cotes, whom Santa Sofía de la Piedad had never met, remembered her.</t4857> <t4858>Buying her a pair of beautiful shoes and a ceremonial dress was a debt that Petra Cotes had not been able to repay even during the wonderful days with the money from the lotteries.</t4858> <t4859>When she first set foot in this house, Fernanda had many reasons to believe that Santa</t4859> <t4860>Sofía de la Piedad was a lifelong servant, and if she had heard a few times that she was her mother-in-law, it was very hard to believe, to the point that it took her a long time to realize that it was true, but soon she forgot again.</t4860> <t4861>Santa Sofía de la Piedad never felt uncomfortable with that lowly position.</t4861> <t4862>On the contrary, she enjoyed moving from one corner to another, never complaining, always busy arranging and cleaning the vast house where she had lived since she was young, and especially during the time of the banana company, the house resembled a barracks more than a residence.</t4862> <t4863>But when Úrsula died, the extreme meticulousness and extraordinary work capacity of Santa Sofía de la Piedad also began to decline.</t4863> <t4864>Not only because she was old and exhausted, but also because the house quickly fell into disrepair.</t4864> <t4865>A fresh green moss covered the walls.</t4865> <t4866>When there was no more empty ground in the garden, weeds broke through the cement floor of the hallway as if breaking through a glass pane, and from the cracks grew the same small yellow flowers that almost a century earlier Úrsula had seen in the cup holding Melquíades' false teeth.</t4866> <t4867>There was neither the time nor the means to prevent those brutal attacks of nature, and all day long Santa Sofía de la Piedad chased away the lizards that had crept into the rooms during the night.</t4867>
<t4868>One morning, the old woman saw red ants leaving the holes in the cement, crawling through the garden, climbing up the edges of the stairs, where the begonias had turned the color of the earth, and reaching the innermost parts of the house.</t4868> <t4869>At first, she used a broom, then insecticide, and finally lime to kill the ants, but the next day they reappeared in the same place, constantly moving back and forth, persistent and invincible.</t4869> <t4870>At that time, because she was writing letters to her children, Fernanda was unaware of the unstoppable invasion of weeds and pests.</t4870> <t4871>Santa Sofía de la Piedad continued to fight alone, battling the weeds to keep them from invading the kitchen, chasing away the rapidly multiplying cobwebs on the walls, and scrubbing the termites.</t4871> <t4872>But when she saw that Melquíades' room was also covered in cobwebs and dust, Santa</t4872> <t4873>Sofía de la Piedad began to clean it three times a day, and when she realized that despite her diligent cleaning, the room was still threatened by piles of broken tiles and the foul atmosphere that only Colonel Aureliano Buendía and the young officer had once predicted, she understood that she had failed.</t4873> <t4874>At that moment, Santa</t4874> <t4875>Sofía de la Piedad put on her worn Sunday best, Ursula's old shoes, and a pair of cotton socks that Amaranta Ursula had given her, then wrapped her remaining two or three sets of clothes into a bundle.</t4875>
<t4876>- I give up, - the old man told Aureliano, - this house is just too big, and this frail body of mine can't handle keeping it tidy.</t4876>
<t4877>Aureliano asked Santa Sofía de la Piedad where she was planning to go, and she replied with an ambiguous gesture as if she had no awareness of her own fate.</t4877> <t4878>However, she did try to assert that she would spend her final days with a cousin in Riohacha.</t4878> <t4879>That, too, was uncertain.</t4879> <t4880>Since the death of Santa</t4880> <t4881>Sofía de la Piedad's parents, she had no contact with anyone in the village, no letters or messages, and no one had ever heard her speak of any relatives.</t4881> <t4882>Aureliano gave Santa</t4882> <t4883>Sofía de la Piedad fourteen gold fish, because she had decided to leave when she only had one peso and twenty-five cents left in her pocket.</t4883> <t4884>Through the window, Aureliano saw Santa</t4884> <t4885>Sofía de la Piedad, with her body bent by age, shuffling through the garden carrying a small bundle of clothes, and saw her reach through the door hole to latch it after she had left the house.</t4885> <t4886>From that moment on, no one knew anything about her.</t4886>
<t4887>After learning that Santa Sofía de la Piedad had run away, Fernanda mumbled to herself for an entire day while checking each trunk and each cabinet to ensure that she hadn't taken anything with her.</t4887><t4888>For the first time in her life, Fernanda lit the stove and burned her hand, then had to ask Aureliano to show her how to make coffee.</t4888><t4889>From then on, it was Aureliano who did the cooking.</t4889><t4890>When Fernanda woke up, the food was already prepared by Aureliano and kept warm in the hot ashes; she only needed to leave her bedroom to fetch it and eat at a table covered with a linen cloth, with candles placed on top; when eating, she sat on the innermost chair of fifteen empty chairs.</t4890><t4891>In that setting, Aureliano and Fernanda did not share their loneliness with each other, but each minded their own business.</t4891><t4892>They cleaned their own rooms while cobwebs spread over the rose bushes, covered the rafters, and wove across the walls.</t4892><t4893>It was during this period that Fernanda had the impression that the house was full of ghosts.</t4893><t4894>It was no wonder that objects, especially those used daily, always seemed to change places on their own.</t4894><t4895>Fernanda spent time searching for the scissors she was sure she had left on the bed, only to find them in the kitchen cabinet after rummaging everywhere, a place she believed she hadn't set foot in for four days.</t4895><t4896>Suddenly, there were no plates left in the cupboard, only to find six on the altar and three in the sink.</t4896><t4897>When Fernanda sat down to write, she found the objects moved even more unexpectedly.</t4897><t4898>The inkwell placed on the right would later be found on the left, the blotter disappeared and reappeared two days later under her pillow, the pages written for José Arcadio mixed with those for Amaranta Úrsula, and she always worried that she had put the wrong letter in the wrong envelope, as had happened many times before.</t4898><t4899>Once, she lost her pen.</t4899><t4900>Fifteen days later, the mailman returned it.</t4900><t4901>He had found it in his pocket and had gone around asking whose pen it was.</t4901><t4902>At first, Fernanda believed these incidents were caused by invisible doctors, similar to the disappearance of the uterine rings earlier, and she began writing a letter asking them to leave her alone, but then she had to stop to do something else, and when she returned to her room, not only was the letter gone, but she had also forgotten why she was writing it in the first place.</t4902><t4903>For a while, she thought it was Aureliano.</t4903><t4904>She watched Aureliano, placing objects in his path with the intention of catching him moving them from one place to another, but soon she was convinced that Aureliano never left Melquíades' room unless he needed to go to the kitchen or the bathroom, and he wasn't the type to play pranks.</t4904><t4905>Finally, Fernanda believed it was the work of ghosts and decided to deal with it by securing everything in its proper place.</t4905><t4906>She tied the scissors to the headboard with a long string, tied the pen and blotter to the table leg, and glued the inkwell to the table on the right side where she usually sat to write.</t4906><t4907>But things didn't go smoothly, because just as she was sewing for a while, she couldn't pull the scissors to where she needed to cut, as if the string had been shortened by ghosts.</t4907><t4908>The string tied to the pen was the same, and even Fernanda's arm seemed to shorten, because after writing for a while, she couldn't reach the inkwell anymore.</t4908><t4909>Neither Amaranta Úrsula in Brussels nor José Arcadio in Rome ever knew about these misfortunes.</t4909><t4910>Fernanda wrote to her children that she was living happily, and indeed she was, because she felt free from all constraints, as if life was pulling her back to her parents' world, where she wouldn't have to suffer daily troubles because they were resolved in her imagination.</t4910><t4911>The correspondence with her children made Fernanda lose track of time, especially since Santa Sofía de la Piedad had left.</t4911><t4912>Previously, she had the habit of counting days, months, and years to see how long it would be before her children returned as planned.</t4912><t4913>But when they repeatedly informed her of changed plans, she lost track of the days, and time seemed to stand still.</t4913><t4914>Instead of being anxious, she was pleased with the delay.</t4914><t4915>Fernanda was not impatient when, many years later, José Arcadio informed her that he was about to take lifelong vows, and then later said he was waiting to finish his advanced theology studies to study diplomacy, because she thought of the many obstacles on the long spiral staircase leading to the chair of Saint Peter.</t4915><t4916>On the contrary, she was thrilled by news that meant nothing to others, such as her son seeing the Pope.</t4916><t4917>She was equally delighted when Amaranta Úrsula informed her that her studies would be extended because she was an honor student and received special privileges, something her father hadn't considered in his calculations.</t4917>
<t4918>Three years had passed since Santa</t4918> <t4919>Sophia de la Piedad brought Aureliano the grammar book until he translated the first page.</t4919> <t4920>His work was not in vain, but it was only the first step on a long and unpredictable road, because the text in Spanish made no sense: it was just encoded poems, and Aureliano lacked the means to delve deeper into those poems. However, since Melquiades had told him that the wise Catalonian's bookstore had books that would help him understand the parchments, he decided to ask Fernanda for permission to get those books.</t4920> <t4921>In the room full of broken tiles - the increasing number of which would eventually cause the room to collapse - Aureliano pondered how to appropriately present his request, anticipating the right moment and opportunity, but when he saw Fernanda taking food stored in hot ashes - the only chance to speak to her - the carefully prepared words stuck in his throat, unable to be spoken.</t4921> <t4922>That was the only time Aureliano followed Fernanda.</t4922> <t4923>He listened to the sound of Fernanda's footsteps in the bedroom.</t4923> <t4924>He heard her stepping out to receive letters from her children and send the letters she wrote to them; late at night, he still heard the sound of the pen pressing hard on the paper before hearing the light being turned off and the murmured prayers in the dark.</t4924> <t4925>Only then did Aureliano fall asleep, believing that the opportunity he longed for would come the next day.</t4925> <t4926>Aureliano was under the illusion that his request would not be denied, so one morning he cut his shoulder-length hair, shaved his stubbly beard, put on tight pants and a shirt with a false collar, not knowing whom he had inherited them from, and then went to the kitchen to wait for Fernanda to eat.</t4926> <t4927>But it was not the woman who lived there daily, the woman with her head held high, the woman who walked firmly, but an exquisitely beautiful old lady wearing a yellow mink coat, a gold-plated cardboard crown, and the fragile demeanor of someone who often cried silently.</t4927> <t4928>In fact, since seeing the beauty queen outfit moth-eaten in Aureliano Segundo's trunk, Fernanda had worn it many times.</t4928> <t4929>If anyone had seen her standing before the mirror with regal gestures, they would surely have thought she was mad.</t4929> <t4930>But that was not the case.</t4930> <t4931>Fernanda merely turned the beauty queen outfit into a memory machine. The first time she wore it, she could not avoid the feeling of a lump in her heart and her eyes filled with tears, because at that moment, Fernanda felt the smell of polish on the boots of a soldier who had come to her house to make her a beauty queen, and her soul became transparent with the regret of past dreams.</t4931> <t4932>She felt old and withered, so different from the Fernanda of the most beautiful moments of her life, to the point that she even missed the moments she considered the worst, and only then did Fernanda realize how necessary the clusters of marjoram in the hallway and the steam rising from the rose bushes in the evening were to her, even the fierce nature of those who came from distant places.</t4932> <t4933>Her cold heart, which had firmly withstood the precise blows of daily life, was now shattered by the first attack of nostalgia.</t4933> <t4934>The feeling of sadness had become a need for her, growing over the years and gradually becoming a vice.</t4934> <t4935>She made herself a kind person in her loneliness.</t4935> <t4936>But that morning, when she entered the kitchen and saw the cup of coffee that the thin, pale young man with dreamy eyes had made for her, she felt as if something very strange had struck her.</t4936> <t4937>Not only did Fernanda not allow Aureliano to go, but from then on, she kept the house key carefully in the pouch where she stored unused uterine rings.</t4937> <t4938>That caution was futile, because if Aureliano wanted, he could leave and return without her seeing him.</t4938> <t4939>But the long confinement, the vagueness about the outside world, and the habit of obedience had withered the seeds of stubbornness in Aureliano. So he returned to his room, repeatedly examining the parchments, and late into the night, he still heard Fernanda's sobbing in her bedroom.</t4939> <t4940>One morning, as usual, Aureliano went to light the stove and found in the cold ashes the food left for Fernanda from the previous day.</t4940> <t4941>Aureliano hurriedly looked into the room and saw Fernanda lying on the bed, covered with the mink coat, more beautiful than ever, and her skin as white as ivory.</t4941> <t4942>Four months later, when José Arcadio returned, he found her motionless.</t4942>
<t4943>There was no one who resembled their mother more than José Arcadio. He wore a black silk ceremonial suit, a stiff round-collared shirt, and a soft silk ribbon instead of a tie.</t4943> <t4944>He was a pale, debilitated young man, with tired eyes and a weak mouth.</t4944> <t4945>His black, shiny, and smooth hair was parted by a straight, pale line running down the middle, resembling the hair of saints often seen in paintings and statues.</t4945> <t4946>The shadow of a beard that had been shaved on his wax-like face was a sign of his maturity.</t4946> <t4947>His pallid hands with blue veins, fingers like worms, and a large gold ring with a gemstone on the index finger of his left hand.</t4947> <t4948>When opening the gate for José Arcadio, Aureliano didn't need to guess who it was; he knew this was someone from afar.</t4948> <t4949>When José Arcadio entered, the house was filled with the scent of the perfume that Úrsula had sprinkled on his head when he was a child so that the old woman, in her blindness, could recognize her grandson.</t4949> <t4950>It was incomprehensible why, after so many years away, José Arcadio was still an old-before-his-time boy, profoundly sad and lonely. José Arcadio went straight to his mother's room, where Aureliano had followed Melquíades' method: evaporating mercury for four months in the tube of their six-generation ancestor to preserve the body.</t4950> <t4951>José Arcadio did not ask a single question.</t4951> <t4952>He kissed the forehead of the corpse, then took a small bag from under his robe containing three unused uterine rings and a wardrobe lock. He did all these things decisively, in stark contrast to his usual weakness.</t4952> <t4953>José Arcadio took a small box adorned with a coat of arms from the wardrobe, and in that box, fragrant with cedarwood, he found a very long letter in which Fernanda had poured out countless truths she had kept hidden.</t4953> <t4954>He stood reading the letter with great eagerness but without any anxiety, stopping at the third page to look at Aureliano with a slightly indifferent expression.</t4954>
<t4955>- So, - José Arcadio said in a voice as sharp as a razor, - You are a bastard.</t4955>
<t4956>- I am Aureliano Buendía!</t4956>
<t4957>- Get back to your room - José Arcadio said.</t4957>
<t4958>Aureliano went to his room and did not leave it again, even when he heard the noise of the lonely funeral, he did not step out out of curiosity.</t4958> <t4959>Occasionally, from the kitchen, Aureliano saw José Arcadio pacing around the house, succumbing to his breath full of lustful desire, and until well past midnight, he still followed the sound of José Arcadio's footsteps in the dilapidated bedrooms.</t4959> <t4960>For many months, Aureliano did not hear José Arcadio's voice, not only because he did not speak to him, but also because he did not want anything to happen and did not want to waste time thinking about anything other than those leather hides.</t4960> <t4961>When Fernanda died, Aureliano took what was almost the last golden fish and went to the bookstore of the wise man from Catalonia to buy the books he needed.</t4961> <t4962>On the way, Aureliano paid no attention to what his eyes saw, perhaps because he had no memories of them to compare, and the deserted streets and dull houses were no different from the streets and houses he had imagined before, when he still longed to get to know them.</t4962> <t4963>Aureliano allowed himself to do what Fernanda had forbidden, for the first and only time, and for a very short period, he walked straight through the eleven blocks separating his house from the street where people used to tell fortunes, and with great difficulty, he entered a grimy, dark, and cramped place where it seemed impossible to turn around.</t4963> <t4964>The house did not resemble a bookstore but rather a junkyard with old books scattered on worm-eaten shelves, in cobweb-filled corners, and even in what should have been walkways.</t4964> <t4965>On a long table also piled with books, the owner was writing a lengthy essay with elaborate and somewhat convoluted letters on loose sheets torn from a school notebook.</t4965> <t4966>He had beautiful silver hair that jutted out over his forehead, resembling the crest of a jay; his blue, lively, and narrow eyes exuded the kindness of someone who had read all sorts of books.</t4966> <t4967>He wore sweat-soaked shorts and did not stop writing to see who had come in.</t4967> <t4968>Aureliano easily found the five books he needed among the chaotic pile because they were exactly where Melquíades had told him they would be.</t4968> <t4969>Without saying a word, Aureliano handed the wise old man from Catalonia the five books and the golden fish; the old man examined them, his eyebrows furrowing like two caterpillars.</t4969>
<t4970>"Maybe you're crazy," the old man said in his local language, shrugging his shoulders, then handed back to Aureliano five books and the golden fish.</t4970>
<t4971>- Take them away, - the old man said in Catalan - The only person who reads these books is old Isăc, the BLIND man. So, think carefully about what you're doing.</t4971>
<t4972>Hose Accadio repaired Meme's bedroom, ordering it to be cleaned, fixing the velvet curtains and the brocade canopy in front of the viceroy's bed, and reusing the abandoned bathroom where the cement water tank had turned black from thick and dirty water scum.</t4972><t4973>In those two rooms, the arrogance of the furnishings, the foreign goods, the fake perfumes, and the cheap jewelry had significantly diminished.</t4973><t4974>The only thing in the rest of the house that bothered Hose Accadio was the holy statues on the altar, so one afternoon he burned them to ashes in a fire he lit in the yard.</t4974><t4975>Hose Accadio slept past eleven o'clock.</t4975><t4976>He entered the bathroom wearing a loose house robe adorned with red dragon embroidery and yellow-trimmed slippers; there, while slowly and lengthily praying, he thought of Remedios the Beauty.</t4976><t4977>Before bathing, Hose Accadio used salts stored in three marbled stone jars to scent the water.</t4977><t4978>Instead of using a gourd ladle to pour water over himself, he immersed himself in the fragrant water, lying on his back for two hours, daydreaming in the coolness and reminiscing about Amaranta.</t4978><t4979>A few days after returning, Hose Accadio abandoned his black silk suit, not only because of the heat but also because he was the only one who had such a suit here. Instead, he wore breeches similar to those Pietro Crespi wore during dance lessons and a silk shirt embroidered with his initials on the chest.</t4979><t4980>Twice a week, he washed all his clothes, and while waiting for them to dry, he wore a loose house outfit because he had no other clothes.</t4980><t4981>Hose Accadio never ate at home.</t4981><t4982>He left the house when the midday heat began to wane and returned late at night.</t4982><t4983>Then he would continue to pace around sadly, breathing like a cat, and thinking of Amaranta.</t4983><t4984>She and the terrified gaze of the saint in the night lamp's light were the only memories he had of this house.</t4984><t4985>Many times, during the strange August in Rome, Hose Accadio would wake up in the middle of a dream and see Amaranta emerging from the marble water tank, wearing a thin dress and a black band on her arm, idealized by the sorrow of an exile.</t4985><t4986>While Aureliano Jose tried to drown that image in the bloody mud of war, Hose Accadio, on the contrary, tried to keep it alive in the mire of desire, while pleasing his mother with the deceit of wanting to become a Pope.</t4986><t4987>Neither Hose Accadio nor Fernanda ever thought that their letters to each other were exchanges of fantastical fabrications.</t4987><t4988>Having dropped out of specialized classes shortly after arriving in Rome, Hose Accadio continued to read books on theology and monastic law to avoid jeopardizing the large inheritance his mother often mentioned in her tempting letters, which could free him from the poor and filthy life he shared with two friends in an attic in Trastevere.</t4988><t4989>When Hose Accadio received Fernanda's last letter, written with a premonition of impending death, he gathered the last pieces of his fake jewelry, packed them in a suitcase, and boarded a ship to cross the ocean, where immigrants were packed like cattle in a slaughterhouse, eating maggot-infested pasta and cheese.</t4989><t4990>Before reading Fernanda's will—a fragmented and belated summary of misfortunes—the dilapidated furniture and the weeds in the corridor had already shown Hose Accadio that he had fallen into a trap from which he could never escape, pushed out of the diamond glow and the ancient spring atmosphere of Rome. During sleepless nights, exhausted by asthma, Hose Accadio measured the depth of his misfortune and rummaged through the dark house, where Ursula's old screams had once made him fear the outside world.</t4990><t4991>To ensure little Hose Accadio didn't get lost in the fog, Ursula had once made him stay fixed in a corner of the bedroom, his only place, while the dead would roam the house from dusk. "Any bad deed you do, the saints will tell me," Ursula had told him.</t4991><t4992>The terrifying childhood nights of Hose Accadio had condensed in that corner, where he had to sit motionless on a chair until bedtime, sweating with fear under the vigilant and cold gaze of the tattling saints.</t4992><t4993>That punishment was futile because, back then, Hose Accadio was already afraid of everything around him and was prepared to be startled by anything he would encounter in life: women in society who disobeyed their parents would hemorrhage; women in this family who weren't careful would give birth to pig-tailed children; fighting cocks would bring death to men and torment to others' consciences; guns that merely touching would condemn one to twenty years of war; misguided endeavors that only led to disappointment and madness; all, all things that God had created with infinite charity had been corrupted by the devil. The light from the window, the sound of Amaranta scrubbing in the bath, and the pleasurable sensation of the "silk potato" on his legs all freed Hose Accadio from the terror that had once left him dazed with fear upon waking.</t4993><t4994>Even Ursula seemed different under the radiant garden light because there, she didn't tell him terrifying stories but instead polished his teeth with charcoal powder so he would have the radiant smile of a Pope, cut and smoothed his nails so that pilgrims coming to Rome from all over the world would marvel at the purity of the Pope's hands when he blessed them, styled his hair like a Pope, and sprayed him with perfume so his body and clothes would exude the fragrance of a Pope.</t4994><t4995>In the courtyard of Castel Gandolfo, Hose Accadio had seen the Pope on the balcony, delivering a speech in seven languages to a crowd of pilgrims, and indeed, Hose Accadio only paid attention to the immaculate whiteness of the Pope's powder-dipped hands, the brilliance of his summer attire, and the mysterious fragrance of his perfume.</t4995>
<t4996>About a year after returning home, in order to have money for food, José Arcadio sold all the silver candlesticks and the gold chamber pot inlaid with the family crest, which he only discovered at the last moment that only the inlays were actually gold. His only entertainment was gathering the village children to play at his house.</t4996><t4997>He played with them from noon, making them jump rope in the garden, sing in the hallway, and tumble on the chairs in the living room, while he went from group to group teaching them lessons in good manners.</t4997><t4998>By then, the tight pants and silk shirts were gone; José Arcadio wore old, shabby clothes bought from an Arab's store, but he still maintained his weak dignity and papal demeanor.</t4998><t4999>The children invaded the house just as Meme's friends had done before.</t4999><t5000>Late into the night, their shouts and dances made the house resemble an undisciplined daycare.</t5000><t5001>Aureliano did not mind this invasion as long as the children did not disturb him in Melquíades' room.</t5001><t5002>One morning, two children pushed open the door and were astonished to see a dirty, disheveled man translating parchments at the desk.</t5002><t5003>They did not dare enter but continued to hover around the room, peeking and whispering through the cracks, throwing bugs at the round windows, and once they even nailed shut the doors and windows, causing Aureliano to spend half a day opening them.</t5003><t5004>Delighted that their mischief went unpunished, one morning four children entered the room while Aureliano was in the kitchen and decided to destroy the yellowing parchments.</t5004><t5005>But as soon as they grabbed the yellowed parchments, a divine force lifted them off the ground, holding them suspended in the air until Aureliano returned and reclaimed the parchments.</t5005><t5006>From then on, the children no longer disturbed Aureliano.</t5006>
<t5007>The four oldest children, who still wore shorts despite being on the verge of adulthood, were concerned with the appearance of José Arcadio. They arrived earlier than the others, spending the entire morning shaving him, massaging him with hot towels, grooming his nails, and applying perfume to him.</t5007><t5008>Several times they bathed him, scrubbing José Arcadio from head to toe with soap, while he lay back in the water thinking about Amaranta.</t5008><t5009>Afterwards, they dried him, powdered him all over, and dressed him.</t5009><t5010>Among those children was one with brown curly hair and eyes like pinkish-brown glass, resembling the eyes of the sleeping figurine in the house.</t5010><t5011>This child was very closely attached to José Arcadio, often staying by his side during sleepless nights caused by asthma, silently following him as he paced back and forth in the dim house.</t5011><t5012>One night, through the clear cement, José Arcadio and the child saw a yellow light in Úrsula's bedroom, as if the sun had just risen from the ground, casting a glow that turned the floor into a frosted glass pane.</t5012><t5013>They didn't need to search for the source of that light.</t5013><t5014>Simply lifting the broken glass panels in the corner of the room, where Úrsula's bed was usually placed and where the light was most concentrated, revealed the secret vault that Aureliano Segundo had desperately searched for in his feverish excavations but never found.</t5014><t5015>Inside the vault were three sacks tied with copper wire, containing seven thousand two hundred and fourteen doubloons, each worth four dollars, and these gold coins continued to glow like embers.</t5015>
<t5016>Finding the treasure was like a burst of flame.</t5016><t5017>Instead of returning to Rome with an off-season fortune - a long-cherished dream in the midst of poverty - José Arcadio turned the house into a paradise on earth.</t5017><t5018>He replaced the window curtains and the bedroom canopy with new velvet, had the bathroom floor tiled, and the walls covered with colored tiles.</t5018><t5019>The cupboard in the dining room was filled with sweet fruits, ham, and fruit preserved in wine; the grain storage, long unused, was now opened to store the wines that José Arcadio himself fetched from the train station, packed in boxes bearing his name.</t5019><t5020>One night, José Arcadio and the four eldest children held a party that lasted until dawn.</t5020><t5021>At six in the morning, they came out of the bedroom naked, emptied the bathtub, and filled it with champagne.</t5021><t5022>They frolicked, diving and swimming in it like birds flying in a golden sky full of fragrant bubbles, while José Arcadio did not join in their fun but lay floating on his back, eyes wide open, reminiscing about Amaranta.</t5022><t5023>José Arcadio lay there, pondering and reliving the bitterness of past pleasures, until the children, exhausted, rushed into the bedroom, where they tore down the velvet curtains to dry themselves, breaking a mirror into four pieces in the chaos, and ripped the bed sheets as they crowded in to sleep.</t5023><t5024>When José Arcadio returned from the bathroom, he found them lying naked, sleeping huddled together in the stifling room.</t5024><t5025>He was annoyed, less by their destruction and more by his own disgust and pity for himself in the empty, dull aftermath of debauchery. He grabbed the priest's dog-chasing stick, which was kept at the bottom of a chest with other church punishment tools, and drove them out of the house, shouting like a madman and beating them mercilessly.</t5025><t5026>José Arcadio collapsed from an asthma attack that lasted several days, looking like a dying man.</t5026><t5027>On the third night, unable to bear the suffocation, José Arcadio went to Aureliano's room to ask him to buy some powder medicine from a nearby pharmacy to clear his airways.</t5027><t5028>Thus, Aureliano left the house for the second time.</t5028><t5029>He only needed to walk two blocks to reach a pharmacy with dusty glass cabinets containing jars labeled in Latin; there, a girl with the mysterious beauty of a Nile River snake sold him the medicine José Arcadio had written on paper.</t5029><t5030>Seeing the deserted streets for the second time, now bathed in the yellow light of street lamps, Aureliano was no more curious than before.</t5030><t5031>When José Arcadio thought Aureliano had run away, he saw him return, slightly out of breath from hurrying, dragging his weak and slow legs due to confinement and lack of activity.</t5031><t5032>Aureliano's indifference to the outside world was so evident that a few days later, when José Arcadio did not keep his promise to his mother and allowed Aureliano to go wherever he wanted, Aureliano replied:</t5032>
<t5033>- I have nothing to do out on the street.</t5033>
<t5034>Aureliano continued to lock himself in his room and bury his head in the parchments. Gradually, he could read what was written on them but still couldn't interpret their content.</t5034><t5035>José Arcadio brought Aureliano slices of ham and sweet fruits that left a lingering taste of spring in the mouth, and twice he even brought fine wine.</t5035><t5036>José Arcadio didn't care about the parchments, which he considered a mysterious pastime, but he was intrigued by the strange wisdom and worldly knowledge that his melancholic nephew possessed.</t5036><t5037>He knew that Aureliano could read English and, while studying the parchments, Aureliano had read all six volumes of the encyclopedia from cover to cover as if they were novels.</t5037><t5038>At first, he thought so because Aureliano could talk about Rome as if he had lived there for many years, but soon he realized that Aureliano knew many things not found in the encyclopedia, such as market prices.</t5038><t5039>"People know everything," was Aureliano's only answer when José Arcadio asked him how he had acquired such knowledge.</t5039><t5040>For his part, Aureliano was surprised to see that, up close, José Arcadio was very different from the image he had of him when he saw him walking around the house: José Arcadio was someone who could laugh, occasionally allow himself to reminisce about the family's past, and worry about the poverty of Melquíades' room.</t5040><t5041>Their growing closeness, between two lonely people of the same bloodline, was far from achieving friendship, but it allowed them to endure the profound, immeasurable solitude that both separated and united them.</t5041><t5042>At that time, José Arcadio could ask Aureliano to help solve certain difficulties in the increasingly burdensome household chores.</t5042><t5043>Aureliano, in turn, could sit and read on the porch, receive Amaranta Úrsula's letters regularly and on time, and use the bathroom that José Arcadio had initially forbidden him to enter.</t5043><t5044>One hot morning, both were awakened by urgent knocks at the gate.</t5044><t5045>The visitor was an old, dark-skinned man with large, blue eyes that gave his face a ghostly phosphorescence, and a cross of holy ash imprinted on his forehead.</t5045><t5046>His shabby clothes, torn shoes, and an old backpack slung over his shoulder were his only belongings, making him look like a beggar, but his demeanor was dignified, contrasting sharply with his appearance.</t5046><t5047>Just one look at him, even in the dimly lit living room, was enough to realize that some mysterious force had allowed him to survive, not through the instinct of survival but through the habit of fear.</t5047><t5048>He was Aureliano Buendía Amador, the only surviving one of Colonel Aureliano Buendía's seventeen sons, seeking a bit of rest in his long and perilous life on the run.</t5048><t5049>He introduced himself and begged for permission to take refuge in this house, which he had thought of during his miserable nights as the last safe haven left in his life.</t5049><t5050>But José Arcadio and Aureliano did not recognize him.</t5050><t5051>They thought he was a vagabond and pushed him back onto the street.</t5051><t5052>At that moment, from the gate, they witnessed the final scene of a tragedy that had begun before José Arcadio could remember.</t5052><t5053>Two policemen, who had been hunting Aureliano Amador for many years and had followed him like dogs across half the world, suddenly emerged from the almond trees across the fence and shot him twice, the bullets piercing straight through the cross of holy ash.</t5053>
<t5054>In fact, since driving the children out of the house, José Arcadio often awaited news of a ship crossing the Atlantic that would leave before Christmas to go to Naples.</t5054><t5055>José Arcadio had told Aureliano about it, and he even devised a plan for Aureliano to start a business to make a living, as since Fernanda's funeral, the food baskets were no longer being delivered.</t5055><t5056>But that final dream of José Arcadio was also not realized.</t5056><t5057>One September morning, after having coffee with Aureliano in the kitchen, José Arcadio went to bathe as usual, and when he was about to finish, the four children who had been driven out of the house suddenly burst in through the holes in the roof tiles.</t5057><t5058>Not giving José Arcadio time to defend himself, they jumped into the bath fully clothed, grabbed his hair, and held his head underwater until no more bubbles of his dying breath rose to the surface, and José Arcadio's dolphin-like body lay motionless and pale at the bottom of the fragrant water.</t5058><t5059>Then they took away three bags of gold coins that only they and their victim knew the hiding place of.</t5059><t5060>It was a swift, methodical, and brutal act, resembling a military assault.</t5060><t5061>Aureliano, being in a closed room, knew nothing of it.</t5061><t5062>That afternoon, while in the kitchen, Aureliano missed José Arcadio and went to look for him throughout the house, finding him floating in the fragrant water of the bathtub, bloated, but still thinking of Amaranta.</t5062><t5063>It was then that Aureliano realized how much he had begun to love him.</t5063>
<t5064>Chapter 19</t5064>
<t5065>Amaranta Úrsula returned at the beginning of December, cheerful and exuberant, leading a docile husband by a silk rope tied around his neck.</t5065> <t5066>She returned suddenly, without any prior notice, dressed in an ivory white outfit, wearing a pearl necklace that reached down to her knees, along with jade and precious stone rings, her hair curled smoothly, with swallow-shaped hairpins adorning her temples.</t5066> <t5067>The man she had married six months earlier was a Finnish man, already advanced in age, handsome and with the appearance of a sailor.</t5067> <t5068>Even before pushing open the outer room door, Amaranta Úrsula immediately realized that, compared to her plans, she had been absent for too long and had returned too late.</t5068>
<t5069>- Oh my God, - she exclaimed with more joy than fear, - why isn't there a single woman here!</t5069>
<t5070>Amaranta Úrsula's luggage couldn't fit in the hallway.</t5070> <t5071>Besides the old trunk of Fernanda that her parents had sent to school, Amaranta Úrsula also brought back two wardrobes, four large suitcases, a sack full of parasols, eight boxes of straw hats with a huge cage containing fifty canaries, her husband's disassembled pedal bicycle packed in a bag that could be carried like a cello.</t5071> <t5072>After the long trip, she didn't rest for even a day.</t5072> <t5073>Amaranta Úrsula donned the worn-out thick fabric overalls her husband brought back along with some motorcyclist clothes, and started renovating the house. She drove away the red ants that had taken over the hallway, tended to the rose bushes, uprooted the weeds, and replanted the pots of ferns, basil, and begonias by the stairs.</t5073> <t5074>Amaranta Úrsula supervised a team of carpenters, locksmiths, and masons to plaster the cracks in the floor, repair the doors, fix the furniture, and whitewash the walls both inside and out, so that just three months after her return, the youthful and festive atmosphere of the time when the automatic piano was still there had returned to the house.</t5074> <t5075>No one in this house had ever been as consistently cheerful, at any time and under any circumstances, as Amaranta Úrsula. No one had ever been as ready to dance, sing, and discard all dry objects and customs into the trash as she was. With a single sweep of her broom, Amaranta Úrsula cleared away all the mournful mementos, useless items, and superstitious offerings piled in the corners, keeping only - out of gratitude to Úrsula - the picture of Remedios in the front room: "How beautiful," she exclaimed, laughing heartily, "An old lady of fourteen!"</t5075> <t5076>When a mason mentioned that the house was full of ghosts and that they could only be driven away by finding the treasures buried there, Amaranta Úrsula laughed heartily and said she didn't believe in such superstitions.</t5076> <t5077>Amaranta Úrsula was so natural, relaxed, and had such a fresh and liberal spirit that seeing her made Aureliano feel awkward.</t5077> <t5078>"Wonderful," Amaranta Úrsula exclaimed joyfully, with open arms.</t5078> <t5079>"My esteemed cannibal has grown up so much!"</t5079> <t5080>Before Aureliano could react, Amaranta Úrsula had placed a record in the portable phonograph she had brought and taught him the latest dances.</t5080> <t5081>She made Aureliano discard the filthy pants inherited from Colonel Aureliano Buendía, gifted him youthful-style shirts and two-tone shoes, and made him go out whenever he stayed too long in Melquíades' room.</t5081>
<t5082>Amaranta Úrsula was lively, slender, and stubborn like Úrsula, beautiful and seductive like Remedios the Beauty, and she had a very strange innate instinct for being ahead of fashion trends.</t5082> <t5083>When she received drawings of the latest fashions through the mail, Amaranta Úrsula immediately knew that she had not been wrong in coming up with those designs, and those were exactly the patterns she had sewn on Amaranta's crude hand-crank sewing machine.</t5083> <t5084>She had subscribed to many fashion magazines and newsletters about folk art and music published in Europe, and with just a glance, Amaranta Úrsula knew that everything was happening exactly as she had envisioned.</t5084> <t5085>It was incomprehensible why a woman with such a rich spiritual life would return to a town as dead and engulfed in dust and heat as this one, especially with a husband who had enough money to live anywhere else in the world and loved his wife so much that he would let her lead him around by a silk rope.</t5085> <t5086>However, it became increasingly clear that Amaranta Úrsula intended to stay here for good because she only accepted long-term plans and did only what served to prepare for a convenient life and a peaceful old age in Macondo.</t5086> <t5087>The canary cage showed that these intentions were not accidental.</t5087> <t5088>When Amaranta Úrsula remembered that her mother had written in a letter about the destruction of birds, she immediately postponed her plans for a few months until a ship that had passed through the Fortunate Isles arrived, and on that ship, she selected the twenty-five most beautiful pairs of canaries to bring back and repopulate the skies of Macondo.</t5088> <t5089>Among the many unrealized initiatives of Amaranta Úrsula, this was the most regrettable.</t5089> <t5090>She released each pair of canaries with the intention that they would multiply, but they flew away from Macondo before realizing they were free.</t5090> <t5091>She tried in vain to keep them with the cage that Úrsula had built during the first house renovations.</t5091> <t5092>She made fake nests from reeds in the almond trees, scattered millet seeds on the roof tiles, and used the songs of the caged birds to call the others back, but all in vain, as they only intended to leave, flying in circles in the sky to find their way back to the Fortunate Isles.</t5092>
<t5093>One year after returning, although she had not yet formed any close friendships and had not organized any gatherings, Amaranta Úrsula still believed that she could restore the community that was in such a state of misfortune.</t5093><t5094>Her husband, Gastón, always took care not to clash with his wife, even though from that unforgettable afternoon when he stepped off the train, he had thought that his wife's decision was driven by a nostalgic illusion of her homeland.</t5094><t5095>Convinced that reality would change that decision, he didn't even bother to reassemble his bicycle but instead went looking for the most beautiful spider eggs in the webs that the masons knocked down, tearing them apart with his fingernails and spending hours watching the tiny spiders emerge through a magnifying glass.</t5095><t5096>Later, believing that Amaranta Úrsula continued her renovation work to keep her hands from becoming clumsy and deformed, Gastón reassembled his bicycle, which had a front wheel much larger than the rear, and then caught and dissected strange insects he found around the house, placing them in jam jars and sending them to his old natural history professor at the University of Liège, where he had excelled in biology despite always wanting to become a pilot.</t5096><t5097>When riding his bicycle, Gastón wore circus performer pants, colorful socks, and a detective-style hat, but when walking, he wore an impeccable suit made of coarse linen, white shoes, a small silk tie, a flat-brimmed straw hat, and carried a cane.</t5097><t5098>Gastón had light gray eyes that accentuated his sailor-like demeanor and a reddish-brown mustache like squirrel fur.</t5098><t5099>Although Gastón was at least fifteen years older than his wife, he had very youthful tastes, always wanting to make his wife happy and possessing the qualities of a good lover, all of which compensated for the age difference between them.</t5099><t5100>In fact, anyone who saw the cautious habits of this man in his forties, always obedient to his wife, and his push bicycle - a circus-style bike - could not imagine that he and his young wife shared a harmonious and passionate love, that in the most inconvenient and unexpected places, they always satisfied each other as they did when they first met, with a love that grew deeper and richer each day.</t5100><t5101>Gastón was not only an intense lover with endless knowledge and imagination, but perhaps the first in the history of love to make an emergency landing, nearly losing his life along with his lover, just because he wanted to make love in a field of violets.</t5101>
<t5102>Gastón and Amaranta Úrsula met three years before their wedding day, when Gastón's biplane, made of thick fabric and thin aluminum, made a daring flight to avoid hitting a flagpole, and its tail got caught in the electric wires, forcing Gastón to jump into Amaranta Úrsula's schoolyard.</t5102> <t5103>From that day on, despite having a splint on his leg, Gastón would visit the boarding house for women of faith, where Amaranta resided regularly—where the rules were not as strict as Fernanda would have wanted—every weekend to take her to his sports club.</t5103> <t5104>They began to fall in love at an altitude of five hundred meters, on a Sunday while flying over the barren fields, and they felt even more connected when they realized how small they were on Earth.</t5104> <t5105>Amaranta Úrsula spoke of Macondo as if it were the most radiant and peaceful village in the world, of the large house always filled with the scent of marjoram, where she wanted to live until old age with her faithful husband and two stubborn sons who would be named Rodrigo and Gonzalo, never Aureliano or José Arcadio, and a daughter named Virginia, definitely not Remedios.</t5105> <t5106>Amaranta Úrsula frequently reminisced about the idealized village of her memories, making Gastón understand that she would not marry him unless she could live in Macondo.</t5106> <t5107>Gastón agreed, as he would later agree to all his wife's whims, believing that it was just a fleeting desire that time would erase.</t5107> <t5108>But after two years of living in Macondo and seeing Amaranta Úrsula still as joyful as the day they arrived, Gastón began to see warning signs.</t5108> <t5109>By then, he had dissected countless insects in the area, spoke Spanish like a local, and had filled in all the crossword puzzles in the magazines they received by mail.</t5109> <t5110>Gastón could not use the climate as an excuse to return early, as nature had endowed him with a liver that could easily adapt to foreign lands, endure the stifling midday heat, and drink water with larvae in it.</t5110> <t5111>He enjoyed the local delicacies, once eating eighty-two lizard eggs.</t5111> <t5112>In contrast, Amaranta Úrsula brought fish and seafood preserved in ice boxes, canned meat, and fruit jams, as she could only eat those; she still dressed in European fashion and received fashion illustrations by mail even though she went nowhere and visited no one, and despite her husband's dwindling enthusiasm for praising her short dresses, tilted wool hats, and jewelry that required seven loops to wrap around her.</t5112> <t5113>Perhaps Amaranta Úrsula's mystery lay in her constant search for ways to stay busy, doing household chores she invented, hastily doing some tasks only to fix them the next day, with a dangerous urgency that made Fernanda think of the hereditary flaw in this house of doing things only to undo them.</t5113> <t5114>Amaranta Úrsula remained cheerful, so when she received a new record, she would ask Gastón to stay in the outer room for a long time while she practiced the dances her school friends had illustrated, and they often ended with lovemaking on the Viennese rocking chairs or the bare floor.</t5114> <t5115>All she needed to be completely happy was a child, but she respected the agreement with her husband not to have children until they had lived together for five years.</t5115>
<t5116>To avoid feeling empty during idle hours, Gastón went to Melquíades' room with the reclusive Aureliano.</t5116> <t5117>Gastón enjoyed telling Aureliano about the most familiar places in his homeland, which Aureliano knew thoroughly as if he had lived there for many years.</t5117> <t5118>When Gastón asked how to know things that were not recorded in the encyclopedia, he received the same answer that Aureliano had given to José Arcadio: "One knows everything."</t5118> <t5119>Besides Sanskrit, Aureliano knew English, French, a little Latin, and Greek. During that time, Aureliano went out in the afternoons and was given a weekly allowance by Amaranta Úrsula, which he spent on books, making his room resemble a section of the wise old Catalonian's bookstore.</t5119> <t5120>Aureliano read voraciously until late at night, although from the way he read, Gastón thought that Aureliano did not buy books to seek information but to verify whether his knowledge was accurate, and he liked no book more than the manuscripts on parchment to which he devoted the best hours of the early morning.</t5120> <t5121>Both Gastón and his wife wanted to integrate into family life, but Aureliano was a secretive person, with an ever-thickening layer of mysterious fog surrounding him.</t5121> <t5122>Gastón could not get close to Aureliano, and he had to find other amusements to pass the time during his idle moments.</t5122> <t5123>At that time, he came up with the idea of establishing an airmail service.</t5123>
<t5124>That is not a new project.</t5124><t5125>In fact, Gastón had that intention ever since he met Amaranta Úrsula, but back then, he did not plan to establish it in Macondo but in the Belgian Congo, where his family had investments in palm oil production.</t5125><t5126>After marrying Amaranta Úrsula, he decided to live in Macondo for a few months to please his wife, so he had to abandon the previous plan.</t5126><t5127>But when Gastón saw Amaranta Úrsula persistently organizing public reforms and even laughing when he hinted at the possibility of returning to his homeland, he realized that things had gone too far. Thus, Gastón reconnected with his close friends in Brussels, whom he had long neglected, and he thought that becoming a scout in the Caribbean or Africa would be the same.</t5127><t5128>While everything was progressing, Gastón prepared a landing strip on a vast, barren land that resembled a cracked, dry field. He studied the wind direction, the geography of the coastal region, and the appropriate flight paths, unaware that his careful work—very similar to that of Mr. Herbert—had aroused dangerous suspicions among the villagers, who thought his goal was not to pave the way but to plant bananas.</t5128><t5129>Excited by the sudden realization that ultimately confirmed his reason for staying in Macondo, Gastón went to the provincial capital several times, met with authorities, obtained permits, and signed exclusive contracts.</t5129><t5130>Meanwhile, he continued to correspond with his close friends in Brussels, similar to the correspondence between Fernanda and the invisible doctors, persuading them to send the first airplane along with a team of skilled mechanics to assemble it at the nearest port and then fly it to Macondo.</t5130><t5131>A year after starting his measurements and meteorological calculations, trusting in the repeated promises of his correspondents, Gastón had developed the habit of looking up at the sky while walking, listening to the wind, and anticipating the appearance of the airplane.</t5131>
<t5132>The return of Amaranta Úrsula brought about a fundamental change in the life of Aureliano, although she did not notice it. After José Arcadio's death, Aureliano became a regular customer of the wise old man from Catalonia.</t5132><t5133>Moreover, at this time, Aureliano was free and had time.</t5133><t5134>These factors aroused in him a certain curiosity about the town that he was not unfamiliar with.</t5134><t5135>On the deserted and dusty streets, with a scientific rather than humanitarian interest, Aureliano examined the insides of the dilapidated houses, the rusted iron grilles on the windows, and the flocks of dying birds along with the people weakened by the softening of time.</t5135><t5136>With his imagination, he aimed to restore the destroyed splendor of the city from the banana company era, where now the swimming pool was dry and filled with men's shoes and women's sandals. In the ruined houses, Aureliano found the skeleton of a German shepherd still tied to an iron chain collar, and a telephone that kept ringing. When Aureliano picked up the receiver, he understood what an ancient and sorrowful woman was asking in English through the phone. He replied that yes, the strike had ended, three thousand dead bodies had been thrown into the sea, the banana company had left, and for many years Macondo had returned to peace.</t5136><t5137>These walks led Aureliano to the dilapidated brothel district, where people once burned bundles of money for fun during the dances. Now it was the most mournful area, with a few red lights still lit, empty dance halls decorated with discarded crowns, where widows belonging to no one, pale and obese, old French women, and Babylonian madams continued to wait beside hand-cranked phonographs.</t5137><t5138>Aureliano did not find anyone who remembered his family; even Colonel Aureliano Buendía was no longer remembered, except by the oldest man among the black people from Antilles, an old man with hair as white as cotton, resembling a figure in a negative film, who continued to sing under the porch the mournful songs of the twilight.</t5138><t5139>Aureliano spoke with the old man in the dialect of Curaçao that he had learned in a few weeks, and occasionally ate with him the chicken head soup cooked by the girl who called him grandfather.</t5139><t5140>She was a large black girl, with sturdy bones, hips like a horse's, breasts like two fresh melons, a round and beautiful head covered with a copper wire hairnet resembling a medieval warrior's helmet.</t5140><t5141>Her name was Nigromanta.</t5141><t5142>At that time, Aureliano sold dinner sets, candle holders, and other old household items to get money for food.</t5142><t5143>When he had no money, which was often, Aureliano went to the market eateries, where they gave him chicken heads that would otherwise be thrown into the trash. Aureliano brought them back for Nigromanta to make soup, and she added herbs to make it tastier.</t5143><t5144>After the old man died, Aureliano did not visit Nigromanta's house as often as before, but he still met her under the almond trees in the square when she was soliciting the rare night customers with a whistle like a wild animal's call.</t5144><t5145>Many times, Aureliano accompanied Nigromanta and talked to her in the Curaçao dialect about chicken head soup and other delightful things of poverty. He would have continued if Nigromanta had not told him that his presence with her would make her lose customers.</t5145><t5146>Although there were times when Aureliano felt desire and Nigromanta also sympathized and wanted to share with him, they had not yet slept together.</t5146><t5147>Therefore, until Amaranta Úrsula returned to Macondo and hugged and kissed him affectionately, leaving him speechless, Aureliano was still a young man inexperienced in love.</t5147><t5148>Every time Aureliano saw Amaranta Úrsula, and worst of all when she taught him new dances, he felt a thrilling sensation in his bones, the same feeling that had once made his great-great-grandfather numb when Pilar Ternera used the pretext of reading his fortune with cards in the corn shed.</t5148><t5149>Suppressing his inner torment, Aureliano buried himself in the writings on the parchment and avoided the innocent seduction of the woman who had caused him many sleepless nights due to unfulfilled desire. But the more he avoided Amaranta Úrsula, the more he longed to hear her laughter, her cat-like purring during sexual satisfaction at any time and in the most unexpected places in the house.</t5149><t5150>One night, on the large table in the jewelry workshop, just ten meters from Aureliano's bed, Amaranta Úrsula and her husband engaged in passionate lovemaking, oblivious to the world.</t5150><t5151>That night, not only could Aureliano not sleep, but the next day he was still feverish and frustrated to the point of tears.</t5151><t5152>For Aureliano, the memory of the first night he waited for Nigromanta under the almond trees, trying to overcome his anxiety and hesitation, clutching a peso and a half that he had asked from Amaranta Úrsula, would never fade. He did not ask for the money out of necessity but to humiliate Amaranta Úrsula by using it to buy sex from another woman.</t5152><t5153>Nigromanta led Aureliano into a room dimly lit by cheap candles, to a bed made of planks on trestles and covered with a dirty sheet from previous orgies. She welcomed Aureliano with a hardened, shameless body, showing no emotion. She prepared to milk Aureliano like a shy boy, but immediately Nigromanta realized he was a fierce man, making her writhe all over.</t5153>
<t5154>Aureliano and Nigromanta had an affair.</t5154><t5155>Aureliano spent his mornings reading symbols on pieces of parchment, and in the afternoons he would go to the stimulating bedroom where Nigromanta awaited to teach him one trick after another until she had to leave Aureliano to go hunt for other "stray cattle."</t5155><t5156>It was only after a few weeks that Aureliano discovered that Nigromanta had a small string around her waist, as if made from violin strings but as tough as steel, with no visible seam because it had grown with her.</t5156><t5157>Almost always, between their bouts of lovemaking, they would eat naked on the bed, in the terrible heat and under the stars visible through the rusted holes in the tin roof.</t5157><t5158>For the first time, Nigromanta had a steady man, a "stake" as she laughingly called it, which led her to start having illusions about love. These illusions only ended when Aureliano confessed his unfulfilled longing for Amaranta Úrsula, a longing that Nigromanta could not quell. On the contrary, his torment grew as his experiences broadened his horizons of love.</t5158><t5159>Thus, although she continued to receive Aureliano passionately, Nigromanta began to demand payment fiercely. When Aureliano had no money, she kept a tally, not with numbers but with scratches on the back of the door.</t5159><t5160>In the evenings, while Nigromanta wandered in the dark around the square, Aureliano paced the hallway like a stranger in the house. He would briefly greet Amaranta Úrsula and Gastón—who dined at that hour every day—then return to his room, close the door, and find himself unable to read, write, or even think, restless from the sounds of playful laughter and the subsequent bursts of pleasure from the couple throughout the night.</t5160><t5161>That was Aureliano's life for two years before Gastón began waiting for the airplane to arrive, and it continued until one afternoon when Aureliano went to the bookstore of the wise old Catalonian and encountered four talkative young men fiercely debating medieval cockroach extermination methods.</t5161><t5162>The bookstore owner, knowing Aureliano's interest in places previously read only by Saint Bede the Venerable, cleverly invited him to join the discussion. Aureliano then launched into a monologue, explaining that cockroaches, according to the Old Testament, were the earliest winged creatures on earth and had died the most from being crushed by slippers. However, they were completely resistant to any extermination method, from borax-mixed tomatoes to flour mixed with sugar. Since ancient times, one thousand six hundred and three types of cockroaches had withstood humanity's relentless and merciless pursuit, a pursuit as persistent as humanity's own self-destructive tendencies. Along with the instinct to procreate, humans also had an instinct to kill cockroaches. If cockroaches had survived humanity's wrath, it was because they hid in the dark, where they were safe, as humans have an innate fear of darkness. Conversely, cockroaches feared the midday sun, so the only effective method to exterminate them in medieval times, now, and forever, was sunlight.</t5162>
<t5163>That encyclopedic fatalistic theory was the basis for a deep friendship among these young people.</t5163> <t5164>Since then, every afternoon Auréliano would meet the four argumentative young men, namely Anvaro, Hecman, Anphonso, and Gabriel, his first and also his last friends in life.</t5164> <t5165>For a man who had confined himself to books like Auréliano, the stormy study sessions, starting at the bookstore at six in the evening and ending at the brothels in the early morning, were a revelation.</t5165> <t5166>Until then, Auréliano had not thought that literature was a game devised to mock others, as Anvaro had shown him during a night of revelry.</t5166> <t5167>It took some time for Auréliano to realize that many oddities stemmed from the example of the wise old man from Catalonia.</t5167> <t5168>To him, knowledge had no value unless it was used to invent a method for making soy milk.</t5168>
<t5169>The afternoon when Aureliano explained about cockroaches, the debate ended at the house of the girls who sold their bodies to make a living, which was a ghostly brothel on the outskirts of Macondo.</t5169> <t5170>The owner of the house was a smiling woman, always worried about opening and closing the doors.</t5170> <t5171>Her perpetual smile seemed to be created by the gullibility of the patrons, who firmly believed that this brothel was real and solid, even though it actually only existed in their imagination, because even the tangible objects there were not real: the chairs would fall apart when someone sat on them, the turntable had a hen sitting on eggs, the garden consisted of paper flowers, the calendar was from years long past, from the time when the banana company first arrived, and the pictures were cut from magazines that had never been printed.</t5171> <t5172>Even the shy prostitutes who ran over from the neighboring houses when she announced there were customers were not real people.</t5172> <t5173>These girls appeared without greeting anyone, wearing floral dresses from when they were five years old or younger, which they took off with the same innocent gestures as when they put them on, and at the height of passion, they would exclaim in surprise about the intensity, saying to look at the ceiling collapsing, and the next day, after receiving one and a half pesos, they would spend all the money on a cake and a piece of cheese that the owner sold them, at which point she was happier than ever because only she knew that even those things were not real food.</t5173> <t5174>Aureliano, whose world at that time began with the leather-bound books full of letters and ended at Nigromanta's bed, found in that ghostly brothel a foolish remedy for his shyness.</t5174> <t5175>At first, Aureliano did not dare enter a room where the owner would often walk in at the best moments of lovemaking, commenting on all sorts of pleasures of the participants.</t5175> <t5176>But gradually he became accustomed to those earthly delights, to the point that on one of the wildest nights, he stripped off his clothes in the reception room, walking around the house while balancing a beer bottle on his unusually large male parts.</t5176> <t5177>It was Aureliano who invented the bizarre games that the owner participated in with an unending smile, neither opposing nor believing those games were real, just as her attitude when Herman tried to burn the house down to prove it didn't exist, or when Alfonso twisted the parrot's neck and threw it into the boiling pot to start cooking the chicken.</t5177>
<t5178>Although Aureliano felt a unique bond of friendship and affection with the entire group, to the extent that he thought the other four were just one, he was still closer to Gabrien than to the other three.</t5178><t5179>This bond arose on the night when Aureliano accidentally mentioned Colonel Aureliano Buendía, and Gabrien was the only one who did not believe that Aureliano was mocking anyone.</t5179><t5180>Even the hostess, who usually did not interfere in conversations, raised her voice to argue that Colonel Aureliano Buendía, whom she had indeed heard of a few times, was just a character invented by the government to justify killing the Liberals.</t5180><t5181>On the contrary, Gabrien did not show any doubt about the truth of Colonel Aureliano Buendía, because the colonel was a comrade and a close friend of his ancestor, Colonel Gerineldo Márquez.</t5181><t5182>The memories, not entirely intentional, became even more profound when they talked about the massacre of the workers.</t5182><t5183>Whenever Aureliano touched on that topic, not only the hostess but also some people older than her denied the rumors about the workers being surrounded at the station, about the two hundred-car train carrying corpses, and they even insisted on believing what was recorded in legal documents and in elementary school books that the banana company never existed at all.</t5183><t5184>Aureliano and Gabrien bonded through a sympathy built on real events that no one believed, events that affected their lives to the extent that they found themselves adrift in the turmoil of a devastated world, where only a sense of longing remained.</t5184><t5185>Gabrien slept anywhere when he was sleepy.</t5185><t5186>A few times Aureliano let him sleep in the goldsmith's workshop, but there he stayed awake all night because of the headaches caused by the noises made by the dead who roamed the bedrooms all night.</t5186><t5187>After that, Aureliano entrusted Gabrien to Nigromanta.</t5187><t5188>In her free time, she took Gabrien to her guest room in the brothel and kept track of debts by marking vertical lines on the back of the door, in the few remaining empty spaces after recording Aureliano's debts.</t5188>
<t5189>Although living very messily, the whole group also tried to do something meaningful and lasting, as requested by the wise man from Catalonia.</t5189> <t5190>With the experience of a former classical literature teacher and with a strange collection of books, he was the one who facilitated them to spend an entire night searching for the thirty-seventh dramatic situation, in a place where no one had the intention or the means to study beyond elementary school.</t5190> <t5191>Enchanted by the discovery of friendship, mesmerized by the hypnosis of a world previously obscured by Fernanda's narrow-mindedness, Aureliano abandoned the deciphering of the inscriptions on the parchment, right at the moment when the mysterious verses had begun to reveal themselves to him.</t5191> <t5192>But after being certain that there was still enough time to do everything without having to give up those brothels, Aureliano regained the will to return to Melquíades' room, deciding not to be discouraged until he had deciphered the final codes.</t5192> <t5193>These events occurred during the time Gaston began waiting for the airplane to arrive, and Amaranta Úrsula lived very lonely.</t5193> <t5194>One morning she entered Melquíades' room:</t5194>
<t5195>- Hello, cannibal, - she said, - you're back in your cave again.</t5195>
<t5196>Amaranta Úrsula was unbearably beautiful, she wore clothes she had made herself and one of the long necklaces she had crafted from fish vertebrae.</t5196> <t5197>Amaranta Úrsula had relaxed her husband, believing in his fidelity, and for the first time since her return, she seemed a bit at ease.</t5197>
<t5198>Aureliano didn't need to look to know that she had arrived.</t5198> <t5199>Amaranta Úrsula leaned her elbows on the table, very close and very gently, making Aureliano feel the murmurs in her bones, and Amaranta Úrsula asked about the inscribed parchments.</t5199> <t5200>Aureliano tried to master his confusion, regain his voice, vitality, and memory as if they had vanished, and spoke to her about the fate of Sanskrit, about the scientific possibility of seeing the future clearly in time as one can read the writing on the back of a paper when holding the front side with writing towards the light, about the necessity of decoding the prophecies to avoid self-defeat, about the Prophecies of Nostradamus, and about the destruction of Cantabria foretold by Saint Midan.</t5200> <t5201>Suddenly, while still speaking, as if spurred by a long-dormant impulse, Aureliano placed his hand on Amaranta Úrsula's and believed that the final decision would end the turmoil.</t5201>
<t5202>But Amaranta Úrsula took his index finger with a tender, innocent gesture that she had often used with him during their childhood, and she kept holding it while Aureliano continued to answer his own questions.</t5202> <t5203>In this way, they connected through a cold, unfeeling index finger, until Amaranta Úrsula seemed to awaken from a fleeting dream and slapped her forehead.</t5203> <t5204>"The ants!" she exclaimed.</t5204> <t5205>Then Amaranta Úrsula forgot about the writings on the parchment and took a light, graceful step towards the door, and from there she raised her finger to her mouth and blew Aureliano a kiss, like the one she had sent her father on that distant afternoon when she left for Brussels.</t5205>
<t5206>- You will explain it to me later, - she said.</t5206> <t5207>- I forgot that today is the day to put lime into the ant nests.</t5207>
<t5208>Whenever there was something to be done near Melquíades' room, Amaranta Úrsula would randomly enter that room and stay for a while, while her husband continued to observe the sky.</t5208>
<t5209>This change gave rise to an illusion in Aureliano, from then on he ate with the family, which was different from the months when Amaranta Úrsula had just returned.</t5209> <t5210>He made Gastón feel comfortable.</t5210>
<t5211>In the stories around the table after dinner, often lasting more than an hour, Gastón appeared distressed because his close friends had deceived him.</t5211><t5212>They had informed Gastón that the airplane had been transferred to a ship that had not yet arrived, and although his acquaintances in maritime work assured him that the ship would never come because it was not listed among the ships in the Caribbean, his close friends insisted that their information was accurate, even hinting that Gastón had deceived them through his letters.</t5212><t5213>The correspondence had made them so suspicious of each other that Gastón decided to stop writing and began to consider the possibility of going directly to Brussels to clarify everything and then return here with the airplane.</t5213><t5214>But that plan was immediately deflated when Amaranta Úrsula reiterated her decision not to leave Macondo, even if it meant living without a husband.</t5214><t5215>In the early days, Aureliano, like others, thought Gastón was a fool in a circus act, which made Aureliano feel a slight pity for him.</t5215><t5216>Later, through his visits to brothels, he gained a deeper understanding of the nature of men and thought that Gastón's gentleness stemmed from a stubborn passion.</t5216><t5217>But as he understood Gastón more deeply and realized that Gastón's true character was contrary to his meek behavior, Aureliano suspected that even Gastón's waiting for the airplane was a deceit.</t5217><t5218>From then on, Aureliano believed that Gastón was not as naive as he appeared; on the contrary, he was an extremely patient, cunning, and calm man who planned to win over his wife by making her weary with complete satisfaction, always agreeing absolutely, leaving her entangled in her own web, until one day, unable to bear the boredom of reachable illusions any longer, she would pack her bags and return to Europe.</t5218><t5219>Aureliano's previous pity turned into deep hatred.</t5219><t5220>Aureliano found Gastón's plans and actions despicable yet effective, so he daringly told Amaranta Úrsula about it.</t5220><t5221>But Amaranta Úrsula laughed at Aureliano's suspicion, showing no sign of a crack in her love, no wavering or jealousy in her heart.</t5221><t5222>Amaranta Úrsula did not think she had stirred anything in Aureliano beyond sincere feelings until one day she cut her hand trying to open a jar of peach jam, and Aureliano rushed to suck the blood from her bleeding finger with such desire and longing that it made her shiver.</t5222>
<t5223>- Auréliano - she laughed, nervous, - you are so ugly, to the point of becoming a cunning bat.</t5223>
<t5224>At that moment, Aureliano was filled with joy.</t5224> <t5225>He placed pitiful kisses on her injured hand, revealing the deepest secrets of his heart, the sorrows, and torments within him.</t5225> <t5226>Aureliano told Amaranta Úrsula how he had woken up at midnight to cry with loneliness and madly crave the underwear she hung to dry in the bathroom.</t5226> <t5227>He recounted how he had desperately demanded Nigromanta to moan like a female cat and whisper "Gastón, Gastón, Gastón" in his ear, and how he had slyly stolen her perfume bottles to rub on the necks of the young women who slept with him for money.</t5227> <t5228>Terrified by the desires of the dissolute man, Amaranta Úrsula slowly clenched her hand, her fingers curling like a snail retreating, until her injured hand no longer felt pain, and every trace of pity turned into a mass of jade and quartz, transforming into lifeless, rigid bones.</t5228>
<t5229>- Idiot! - the girl said as if she were spitting something out... - I will go to Belgium on the first oil train leaving the station.</t5229>
<t5230>One afternoon, Anvaro went to the bookstore of the wise man from Catalonia, loudly proclaiming his latest discovery: a zoo-brothel called the Golden Boy. It was a large roofless room with hundreds of leisurely herons that occasionally squawked noisily. In the wire mesh cages placed around the dance floor, amidst large camellia bushes native to the Amazon, were flocks of flamingos, crocodiles snuffling and rooting in their food troughs like pigs, twelve-bell snakes, and a golden-shelled turtle diving in a small artificial sea.</t5230> <t5231>There was a white female dog, lean, performing the duties of a male by mating with other female dogs, while also doing the work of a mother dog to be fed by people.</t5231> <t5232>The air was gentle, as if newly born, and beautiful mixed-race girls waited in vain among the blood-red camellia petals and outdated records, well aware of the act of lovemaking that humanity had forgotten in this earthly paradise.</t5232> <t5233>On the first night the group visited the imaginary winter retreat, the radiant and silent old lady sitting on a wicker chair guarding the entrance felt time revert to its origins when she discovered that among the five newcomers, there was a man with a gaunt, sallow face, high cheekbones like a Tartar, bearing the eternal mark of loneliness since the dawn of creation.</t5233>
<t5234>- My God! - the old woman exclaimed. - Aurêlianô!</t5234>
<t5235>The old woman was once again seeing Colonel Aureliano Buendía as she had seen the light of the lamp long before the wars, before the dissolution of glory and the decay of joy, that distant night turning into dawn when he entered the bedroom to issue the first command of his life: the command that granted him love.</t5235> <t5236>That was Pilar Ternera.</t5236> <t5237>Many years before reaching the age of one hundred and forty-five, the old woman had abandoned the harmful habit of counting her age, and continued to live in a static time, on the margins of memories, and lived in a completely determined future, beyond the futures disrupted by the constraints and malicious speculations of the cards.</t5237>
<t5238>From that night onward, Aureliano hid in the gentleness and sympathy of the great-great-grandmother he had never known.</t5238> <t5239>Sitting on the wicker rocking chair, the old woman thought about the past, recalling the greatness and misfortunes of the family and the ravaged splendor of Macondo, while Anvaro frightened the crocodiles with his loud laughter, and Alfonso made up terrifying stories about the herons that had pecked out the eyes of a misbehaving village guest the previous week, and Gabriel sat in the room of the mixed-race girl who did not charge her clients but only asked them to write letters for her smuggler lover imprisoned across the Orinoco River after being caught by border guards and forced to sit on a pot until he defecated diamonds and feces.</t5239> <t5240>The brothel, with its madam like a mother, was the very world that Aureliano had always dreamed of in his prolonged restraint.</t5240> <t5241>He felt happy, felt close to achieving perfect communion, to the point that he thought of no other escape on the afternoon when Amaranta Ursula shattered his illusion.</t5241> <t5242>He was ready to beg someone to help him break the frustration that felt like it was choking his chest, but he could only sob in the arms of Pilar Ternera.</t5242> <t5243>The old woman stroked his head, letting him cry to his heart's content.</t5243> <t5244>And even though he did not say he was crying because of love, the old woman immediately recognized the most ancient cry in human history.</t5244>
<t5245>- Come on now, my little one! - the old woman coaxed, - now, little one, tell me who that person is.</t5245>
<t5246>When Aureliano spoke, Pilar Ternera burst into a deep laugh, a laugh that spread from ancient times and then gradually transformed into a cooing sound like that of a pigeon.</t5246> <t5247>There was no secret in the hearts of the Buendía family that the old woman did not understand, because a century of illusions and experience had taught her the history of the family as a long chain of inevitable repetitions, like a record that could keep spinning endlessly if not for the gradual and irreparable wear of the spindle.</t5247>
<t5248>- Don't worry a bit, - the old lady smiled.</t5248> <t5249>- Wherever it is, right now it is also waiting a bit.</t5249>
<t5250>At half-past four in the afternoon, Amaranta Úrsula stepped out of the bathroom.</t5250> <t5251>Aureliano saw her pass by his door in a neatly pressed bathrobe, her head wrapped in a towel.</t5251> <t5252>He quietly tiptoed after her, staggering like a drunk, and entered Amaranta Úrsula and her husband's honeymoon room just as she was unbuttoning her bathrobe and suddenly startled, closed it again.</t5252> <t5253>She silently pointed towards the adjoining room with the door slightly ajar.</t5253> <t5254>Aureliano knew that Gastón was beginning to write a letter there.</t5254>
<t5255>- Get out now, - she hissed, barely audible.</t5255>
<t5256>Aureliano smiled, lifting her up by the waist as if he were carrying a pot of begonias, and laid her down on the bed.</t5256> <t5257>In a swift motion, he pulled off her bathrobe before she could stop him, and he felt as if he were falling into an abyss at the sight of her freshly bathed, naked body, white and smooth, which he had already imagined in the darkness of the adjacent rooms, down to every pore and hidden mole.</t5257> <t5258>Amaranta Úrsula resisted fiercely: with the cunning of an intelligent female, she twisted and turned her supple and fragrant body like a weasel, while pushing her knees into his stomach and scratching his face with her hands, yet neither of them breathed any harder than someone watching the April twilight through a window.</t5258> <t5259>It was a fierce struggle, a life-and-death battle, yet almost devoid of violence, because it was a struggle of phantoms, slow, cautious, solemn, meaning that the time they spent grappling with each other was enough for the shield fern to bloom and for Gastón in the next room to forget all his dreams of becoming a pilot, and they were like two hostile lovers striving to reach a compromise at the bottom of a bright pond.</t5259> <t5260>In that fierce and solemn tug-of-war, Amaranta Úrsula realized that her cautious silence was utterly unreasonable, as it could make her husband in the next room more suspicious than the loud noises she was trying so hard to avoid.</t5260>
<t5261>She then smiled gently and continued to resist, but she was defending herself with feigned bites and gradually stopped writhing to avoid him, until both understood that they were both adversaries and accomplices, and the struggle had turned into a game of caresses.</t5261> <t5262>Suddenly, as if to test the game, to take a risk once more, Amaranta Úrsula stopped resisting, and when frightened by what she herself had facilitated, she tried to react but it was already too late.</t5262> <t5263>A strange tremor had pinned her down, held her tight, and her will to defend herself was crushed by the uncontrollable desire to discover what the yellow howls and the invisible balls waiting for her on the other side of death were.</t5263> <t5264>She only had time to grope for the handkerchief, stuff it into her mouth, and bite down hard to keep the growls of a cat in heat from escaping from the depths of her being.</t5264>
<t5265>Final Chapter</t5265>
<t5266>One joyful night, while guarding the entrance to her paradise, Pila Tecnêra died on her wicker rocking chair.</t5266> <t5267>She was buried without a coffin according to her final wishes.</t5267> <t5268>Eight strong men slowly lowered the rocking chair with the old woman sitting on it into a grave dug right in the middle of the dance floor using thick ropes.</t5268> <t5269>The mulata girls dressed in black, their faces turning pale with grief, hastily performed a prayer for the old woman while removing the necklaces, head ribbons, and bracelets, then threw them into the grave before it was filled and a nameless, dateless tombstone covered with Amazonian camellia wreaths was erected on top.</t5269> <t5270>After poisoning all the pet animals, sealing the doors and windows with bricks and mortar, they scattered across the world, each carrying wooden chests decorated inside with holy pictures, colorful magazine images, photos of lovers, fleeting romances, old long-term lovers, ghostly lovers, those who defecated diamonds, cannibals, and those crowned as gambling kings offshore.</t5270>
<t5271>That was the final judgment.</t5271><t5272>In the grave of Pila Tecnêra, among the hymns and the beads of prostitutes, the decaying refuse of the past, that is all that remains in Macondo since the departure of the wise man from Catalonia.</t5272><t5273>Driven by the longing for an eternal spring, the wise old man from Catalonia had to close his bookstore and return to his village on the Mediterranean coast. No one felt the impact of his decision to return home.</t5273><t5274>To escape the continuous wars, he came to Macondo just as the banana company was flourishing, and he thought of nothing else but to open a bookstore specializing in old books printed in several foreign languages, which random customers would fearfully flip through as if they were dirty books while waiting their turn to have their fortunes told or their futures read in the house across the street.</t5274><t5275>He spent half his life sitting in the hot backyard, diligently recording his peculiar style of literature with violet ink on pages torn from school notebooks, and no one knew exactly what he was writing.</t5275><t5276>When Aureliano met him, he already had two large boxes filled with pages of writing that, in some way, reminded one of the parchment scrolls of Melquíades, and from that time until his departure, he filled a third box, so it was reasonable to think that during his entire stay in Macondo, he did nothing but write.</t5276><t5277>The only people he associated with were four friends who would come to exchange spinning tops and paper kites for his books, and he had them reading Seneca and Ovid while they were still in elementary school.</t5277><t5278>With affectionate tenderness, he treated the classics as if they were roommates he had had in his life.</t5278><t5279>And he knew many things he shouldn't have known, such as Saint Augustine wearing an extra tight-fitting wool vest under his coat until he was fourteen, and that Arnau de Vilanova, a sorcerer, became impotent from a scorpion sting when he was still a child.</t5279><t5280>His enthusiasm for writing was a tapestry interwoven with the locals' respect and gossip.</t5280><t5281>Because he had to learn Catalan to translate them into Spanish, Alfonso had tucked a few of those pages, rolled up with some newspaper clippings and textbook pages, into his pocket, only to lose them one night at the house of one of the prostitutes he was with to stave off hunger.</t5281><t5282>When the wise old man learned of this, instead of scolding him, he laughed and remarked that it was the natural fate of literature.</t5282><t5283>On the contrary, no human force could persuade him not to take the three large boxes of writings with him when he returned home, and he unleashed a torrent of Carthaginian curses to chase away the train inspectors who tried to move the boxes to the freight car, treating them as cargo, until he forced them to let him take them in the passenger car.</t5283><t5284>"Nothing in the world is more ridiculous than a man sitting in the passenger car while literature lies in the freight car."</t5284><t5285>That was the only thing anyone heard him say aloud.</t5285><t5286>He spent a strenuous week with the final preparations for his departure, because the closer the departure time came, the less happy he became, his thoughts became increasingly jumbled, and objects placed in one spot were found in another, haunted by the same ghosts that had once tormented Fernanda.</t5286>
<t5287>- Damn it - he cursed.</t5287> <t5288>- I squat on the twenty-seventh rule of the London Religious Conference.</t5288>
<t5289>Hecman and Aureliano helped the old man carry things.</t5289> <t5290>They helped him like they would help a child, putting the tickets and travel documents in a bag and securing it with a safety pin, making a long, detailed list of all the tasks since leaving Macondo until the ship docked in Barcelona, but they carelessly threw away the pants that contained half of the old man's savings.</t5290> <t5291>The night before the departure, after nailing shut the boxes of documents and packing all the clothes into the same suitcase the old man had brought, squinting his clam-shaped eyelids, with a shamelessly blessing gesture, he pointed to the piles of books that had accompanied him throughout his exile, and said to his comrades:</t5291>
<t5292>- I leave that crap for you guys.</t5292>
<t5293>Three months later, they received a huge envelope containing nearly twenty letters and more than fifty photos, accumulated throughout the leisurely journey on the open sea.</t5293><t5294>Although they were undated, their order clearly indicated the sequence in which the old man wrote these letters.</t5294><t5295>In the first letters, with his usual humorous tone, he told them about the interesting events that happened during the ocean crossing, about the frustration of wanting to knock down the cargo handler who wouldn't allow him to bring three boxes of manuscripts into the cabin on the lower deck, about the cowardice yet wisdom of a lady who was very afraid of the number thirteen, not because of superstition but because she seemed to feel that this number foretold she would stay behind even though the sea journey was not yet over, and about the contest he won on the very first night on the ship because he recognized the smell of radishes soaked overnight in the streams of Lérida in the water served on the ship.</t5295><t5296>However, as the days sequentially passed, the reality on the ship became less and less noticeable to him; even the most recent and ordinary events made him feel they were more distant, as the ship moved further away from the American shore, his memories became increasingly melancholic.</t5296><t5297>This process of nostalgic progression seemed to also manifest in the photos.</t5297><t5298>In the first photos, he appeared happy, wearing a veteran's coat, his hair white as snow in the bright October sunlight of the Caribbean Sea.</t5298><t5299>In the later photos, he appeared in a dark coat, a silk scarf around his neck, looking sad and contemplative due to the emptiness, sitting on the deck of a heavy ship staggering like a sleepwalker on the autumn sea.</t5299><t5300>Herman and Aureliano wrote back to him.</t5300><t5301>In the first months, he wrote letters so diligently that they felt closer to him than when he was still in Macondo, and they felt less irritated for letting him go. At first, he wrote to them, informing them that everything was still normal, that in the house where he was born, the pink snail was still there, that the dried herring still smelled fresh in the biscuit tin, and that the village waterfalls still emitted fragrance at dusk.</t5301><t5302>Once again, he sent them pages of school notebooks written like drawings in violet ink, in which he dedicated a special poem to each friend.</t5302><t5303>However, even though he did not realize it himself, those heartfelt letters gradually turned into pastoral poems full of the meaning of a person who has awakened from a dream.</t5303><t5304>During winter nights, while sitting and watching the pot of soup boil by the fireplace, he remembered the hot air in the backyard, remembered the hum</t5304> <t5305>of the sunlight on the trees. almonds covered with dust, remembering the sound of the train whistle in the hot air at noon, is the nostalgia with which he sat in Macondo, remembering the pot of soup boiling in the fireplace, remembering the cries of the coffee seller and remembering the The nimble lark heralds the coming of spring.</t5305> <t5306>Purged by nostalgia facing each other like mirrors, he lost the magical sense of unreality, until he finished by advising them all to run away from Macondo, to forget everything he had taught them about life, about human love, to shit on Horazio and wherever they went, remember that the past is a lie, that human memory has no way back, that all ancient springs are irrecoverable and that wild and passionate love is only a momentary truth.</t5306>
<t5307>Anvarô was the first person to heed the advice to leave Macondo. He sold all his possessions, including the tiger that was kept in the yard and often bared its teeth to threaten passersby on the street, and bought a one-way ticket on a train that never stopped traveling.</t5307> <t5308>In the postcards he sent from the stations where the train stopped along the way, he described with admiration the fleeting images he saw through the carriage window, as if he were tearing apart and casting into oblivion a long poem of escape: dreamy black people in the white cotton fields of Louisiana, winged horses on the green pastures of Kentucky, Greek lovers in the infernal sunset of Arizona, a girl in a red sweater painting watercolors by the lakes of Michigan who waved her brush to greet him—not a farewell but a hopeful greeting for a reunion, as she did not know she was watching a train that would never return.</t5308>
<t5309>Then Alphonso and Herman left together on a Saturday with the intention of returning on Monday, but no one ever heard any news about them.</t5309> <t5310>A year after the wise old Catalan man left, the only friend still remaining in Macondo was Gabriel, who was still wandering around, completely dependent on the pity of Nigromanta, answering quiz questions for a French magazine, whose grand prize was a trip to visit the capital, Paris.</t5310> <t5311>Aureliano, who was a newspaper subscriber, helped him fill out the questions, sometimes right at his house, but almost always among the pretty porcelain jars and the scent of valerian in the only pharmacy in Macondo, the residence of Mercedes, Gabriel's secret lover.</t5311> <t5312>That was the only thing that would remain of a past whose destruction was never complete, because it kept self-destructing slowly, depleting itself from within, and minute by minute it would end itself, but would never stop its self-ending.</t5312> <t5313>The town had reached those points of stagnation, so when Gabriel won the prize and went to Paris with two bundles of clothes, a pair of shoes, and the complete works of Rabelais, he had to signal the mechanic to stop the train to let him on.</t5313>
<t5314>The old streets of Turkey at that time were a wasteland, where the last Arabs had finally let the god of hunger drag them to death according to the age-old custom of sitting in front of the door, because for many years they had to sell even the last piece of cross-woven fabric, and in the dark display cases, only headless mannequins remained.</t5314> <t5315>The neighborhood of the Banana Company, which perhaps Patricia Brown tried to recount to her descendants during the melancholy nights of pickled cantaloupe from Pratvon Alabama, had become a plain overgrown with weeds.</t5315> <t5316>The old priest, who came to replace Father Angel and whose name no one bothered to know, was waiting for God's mercy, lying sprawled on a hammock, suffering from arthritis and insomnia due to doubt, while lizards and mice argued over who would inherit the adjacent church.</t5316> <t5317>In that forgotten town of Macondo, where even the birds had forgotten it, where the dust and heat had become so unbearable that even breathing was a struggle, Aureliano and Amaranta Úrsula were the only happy people and the happiest on this earth, despite being surrounded by loneliness and love, especially the loneliness of love in a house where it was almost impossible to sleep due to the incessant noise caused by the swarm of ants.</t5317>
<t5318>Gaston had returned to Brussels, because after waiting endlessly for the plane that never arrived, one day he packed his personal belongings and correspondence into a suitcase and left with the intention of returning by plane before his privileges had to be ceded to a group of German pilots who had presented the provincial authorities with a more ambitious plan than his own.</t5318><t5319>Since the afternoon they first made love, Aureliano and Amaranta Ursula continued to seize the rare moments when her husband was away to passionately love each other in brief encounters, always interrupted by the husband's unexpected return.</t5319><t5320>But when they found themselves alone at home, they would collapse in exhaustion in the ecstatic moments of their belated love.</t5320><t5321>It was a wild, frenzied passion, to the point that Fernanda's bones in her grave trembled with fear and seemed to dance incessantly.</t5321><t5322>The joyful moans, the songs of longing from Amaranta Ursula echoed loudly at two in the afternoon on the dining table and at two in the morning in the pantry.</t5322><t5323>"What makes me sad," she laughed, "is that we wasted so much time."</t5323><t5324>And in the frenzy to satisfy her passion, she saw the ants destroying the garden and gnawing at the house's wood to satiate their long-standing hunger, and she saw the red ants once again taking over the hallway, but she only bothered to fight them when they invaded her bedroom.</t5324><t5325>Aureliano neglected the texts written on parchment, stayed indoors, and hastily replied to the letters from the wise old man of Catalonia.</t5325><t5326>They lost their sense of reality, their concept of time, and the rhythm of daily routines.</t5326><t5327>They closed the doors and windows to avoid wasting time undressing, and walked around the house naked like Remedios the Beauty had often wished, rolling in the mud in the yard with their bodies uncovered, and one afternoon they nearly suffocated while making love in the bathtub.</t5327><t5328>In a short time, they wreaked more havoc on the house than the red ants: breaking all the tables, chairs, and cabinets in the living room, tearing apart the hammock that had endured the dull lovemaking of Colonel Aureliano Buendía in the barracks, ripping open the bedding, and scattering the cotton stuffing all over the floor to suffocate each other.</t5328><t5329>Although Aureliano was a lover with as many fierce tricks as his rival, Amaranta Ursula was the one who orchestrated their amusements in that shattered paradise, doing so with such enthusiasm as if she had concentrated in love the fervent energy that their ancestor Ursula had dedicated to making candy figurines. Moreover, while she sang joyfully and laughed heartily at their games, Aureliano grew more contemplative, for his passion was inherently quiet and cold.</t5329><t5330>Nevertheless, both reached the peaks of the art of play, to the extent that when they were exhausted from their indulgences, they found even more delightful mischief in their moments of rest.</t5330><t5331>They devoted themselves to the worship of their bodies, discovering that the moments of rest after pleasure offered untapped possibilities, far more enjoyable than the capabilities of lust.</t5331><t5332>While he applied egg whites to Amaranta Ursula's firm breasts to massage them, or coconut oil to her toned thighs and soft belly to caress them, she treated Aureliano's strong body like a doll to play with, using lipstick to draw clown eyes on him, eyebrow pencil to give him a Turkish mustache, adorning him with an organza tie, and crowning him with a hat made of silver paper.</t5332><t5333>One night, they smeared peach jam all over their bodies from head to toe and licked each other like dogs.</t5333><t5334>Then, like a pair of madmen, they made love in the hallway and were awakened by flesh-eating ants about to devour them alive.</t5334><t5335>During the pauses in their orgies, Amaranta Ursula wrote letters to Gaston.</t5335><t5336>She felt he was too busy and distant, making his return seem impossible to her.</t5336><t5337>In one of the earliest letters he sent, he mentioned that his friends had indeed sent the plane, but a shipping company in Brussels mistakenly sent it to Tanganyika, and at that port, it would be redirected to the community of Macondo. The mistake caused so much trouble that it would take two years just to retrieve the plane.</t5337><t5338>Thus, Amaranta Ursula did not have to worry about her husband's sudden return.</t5338><t5339>As for Aureliano, he had no connection to the outside world other than the letters from the wise old man of Catalonia and the news about Gabriel through the quiet pharmacist, Mercedes.</t5339><t5340>Those were the real connections.</t5340><t5341>To stay in Paris, Gabriel had returned his round-trip ticket for spending money and then lived by selling old newspapers and bottles that the maids pulled out from the dismal Dolphin Hotel.</t5341><t5342>At that time, Aureliano could imagine him always wearing a thick turtleneck sweater, only taking it off when the Montparnasse terraces were filled with springtime lovers, and in the room reeking of boiling cauliflower where Rocamato had starved to death, he had to sleep during the day and write at night to trick his hunger.</t5342><t5343>However, the news about Gabriel he received became less accurate, and the letters from the wise old man grew fewer and duller, to the point that Aureliano came to think of them as Amaranta Ursula thought of her husband, and both floated in an empty world where love was the only reality, both mundane and eternal. While they sang and laughed heartily at their own games, Aureliano became more pensive, for his passion was inherently quiet and cold.</t5343><t5344>However, both reached the heights of the art of play, to the point that when they were exhausted from their indulgences, they found even more delightful mischief during their rest.</t5344><t5345>They dedicated their energy to idolizing their own bodies, discovering that the moments of rest after pleasure had untapped potentials, which were far more enjoyable than the possibilities of carnal desires.</t5345><t5346>While he applied egg whites to Amaranta Ursula's firm breasts to massage them, or coconut oil to her toned thighs and soft belly to caress her, she treated Aureliano's strong body like a doll to play with, using lipstick to draw clown eyes on him, eyebrow pencil to give him a Turkish mustache, adorning him with an organza tie, and crowning him with a hat made of silver paper.</t5346><t5347>One night, they smeared peach jam all over each other from head to toe and licked it off like dogs.</t5347><t5348>Then, like a pair of madmen, they made love in the hallway and were awakened by flesh-eating ants about to devour them.</t5348><t5349>During the pauses in their orgies, Amaranta Ursula wrote replies to Gaston.</t5349><t5350>She felt he was too busy and distant, to the point that his return seemed impossible to her.</t5350><t5351>In one of the earlier letters he sent, he mentioned that his friends had indeed sent the airplane, but a shipping company in Brussels mistakenly sent it to Tanganyika, and at that port, it would be forwarded to the community of Macondo. This mistake caused so much trouble that just retrieving the airplane would take two years.</t5351><t5352>Thus, Amaranta Ursula did not have to worry about her husband's sudden return.</t5352><t5353>As for Aureliano, he had no other connection to the outside world except for the letters from the wise old Catalonian and news about Gabriel through Mercedes, the quiet pharmacist.</t5353><t5354>Those were his real connections.</t5354><t5355>To stay in Paris, Gabriel had returned his round-trip ticket for spending money and then lived by selling old newspapers and bottles that the maids pulled out from the dreary Dolphin Hotel.</t5355><t5356>At that time, Aureliano could imagine him always wearing a thick turtleneck sweater, which he only took off when the Montparnasse terraces were filled with springtime lovers, and in a room reeking of boiling cauliflower, where Rocamato had starved to death, he had to sleep during the day and write at night to stave off hunger.</t5356><t5357>However, the news about Gabriel became increasingly vague, and the letters from the wise old man grew more sparse and dull, to the point that Aureliano began to think of them as Amaranta Ursula thought of her husband, and thus they both floated in an empty world where love was the only reality, both mundane and eternal.</t5357>
<t5358>Suddenly, the news that Gaston would return hit them like a thunderbolt in their blissfully unconscious world.</t5358> <t5359>Aureliano and Amaranta Ursula opened their eyes wide, looked into their hearts, then placed their hands on their hearts, looked straight at each other, and understood that they were so attached to each other that they would accept death if they had to be apart.</t5359> <t5360>So she wrote her husband a letter stating completely contradictory truths, in which she earnestly said that she still loved him and longed to see him again, while also making it clear that she could not live without Aureliano and considered it an unavoidable destiny.</t5360> <t5361>Contrary to what they expected, with a calm attitude, one might say a fatherly attitude, in a two-page letter filled with words, Gaston replied to them, noting that they should be wary of impulsive desires arising from their current passion, and at the end of the letter, he completely agreed not to return to Macondo because he believed they would be happy as he had been in their short-lived married life.</t5361> <t5362>It was such an unexpected attitude that Amaranta Ursula felt humiliated by the thought that she had prepared an excuse for her husband, which he had been waiting for, to abandon her to fate.</t5362> <t5363>Six months later, the hatred deepened when Gaston, from Leopoldville where he had retrieved his airplane, wrote to her again, only asking her to send him the pedal-powered bicycle, which he said was the only thing among what he had left in Macondo that still held sentimental value.</t5363> <t5364>Aureliano calmly took care of Amaranta Ursula's bedroom, trying to show her that he was a worthy husband in both good times and bad, and the daily hardships surrounding them as the last of Gaston's money was spent created a bond of solidarity between them. Though it was not as bright and proud as passion, it helped them love each other more deeply and made them very happy, just as they had been during their time of sensual living.</t5364> <t5365>When Pilar Ternera passed away, they were expecting the birth of their child.</t5365>
<t5366>During her pregnancy, Amaranta Úrsula decided to take up the craft of making bracelets from fish vertebrae.</t5366><t5367>But except for Mercedes, who bought a dozen from her, no one else purchased these bracelets.</t5367><t5368>For the first time in his life, Aureliano realized that his talent for languages, encyclopedic knowledge, and uncanny ability to remember without needing the small details of past events and distant places were as useless as his wife's jeweled box, which at this point might be worth as much as all the money of the last remaining residents of Macondo combined.</t5368><t5369>They lived by a miracle.</t5369><t5370>Although Amaranta Úrsula did not lose her cheerful disposition or her tricks in their revelries, she got used to sitting on the porch after lunch to ponder and daydream.</t5370><t5371>Aureliano was beside her.</t5371><t5372>Sometimes they sat in silence until nightfall, looking into each other's eyes, making love with their souls in silence as they had once done noisily.</t5372><t5373>An uncertain and undefined future forced them to direct their emotions towards the past.</t5373><t5374>They looked at each other and saw themselves in the lost paradise of the rainy season, wading through the muddy puddles in the yard, killing lizards to hang on Úrsula, playing at burying the old woman, and it was these recalled images that made them realize they had been happy since they first had memories.</t5374><t5375>By delving deeply into the past, Amaranta Úrsula remembered an afternoon when she entered the jewelry workshop, and her mother told her that little Aureliano was an illegitimate child because she had found him lying in a basket.</t5375><t5376>Although they felt that this explanation was not based on solid evidence, they had no other source to replace it with a more accurate one.</t5376><t5377>After considering all possibilities, the only thing they were more certain of was that Fernanda was not Aureliano's biological mother. Amaranta Úrsula leaned towards the idea that Aureliano was the son of Petra Cotes, of whom she only remembered scandalous and mythical stories, and this speculation caused them great horror in their souls.</t5377>
<t5378>Aureliano, pained by the clear thought that he was his wife's brother, sought refuge in a monastery to find some reliable trace of his origins in the messy pile of documents that had been gnawed by rats.</t5378> <t5379>The oldest baptismal note he found was the one for Amaranta Buendía, who was baptized by Father Nicanor in her adolescence, during the time when he wandered around the village, taking advantage of the stimulation from chocolate, trying to prove the existence of God.</t5379> <t5380>After going through four directories and finding the notes and birth dates of Aureliano's seventeen brothers, he thought he might be one of the seventeen, but the baptism dates were too far in the past compared to his age.</t5380> <t5381>Seeing him lost in the maze of trying to uncover his true origins and trembling with confusion, the rheumatic priest lying in a hammock observed him and, in a slow voice, asked him what his name was.</t5381>
<t5382>- Aureliano Buendía, - he replied.</t5382>
<t5383>- So don't waste your time searching.</t5383> <t5384>- The priest said firmly. - Long ago, there was a road here called that, and thus the people at that time got used to naming their children after street names.</t5384>
<t5385>Aureliano shouted in anger:</t5385>
<t5386>- Oh my God? - he said.</t5386> <t5387>- So, you don't believe it either.</t5387>
<t5388>- Believe in what?</t5388>
<t5389>- I do not believe that Colonel Aureliano Buendía conducted thirty-two civil wars and was completely defeated.</t5389> <t5390>I also do not believe that the army surrounded and machine-gunned three thousand workers to death and that they loaded the corpses onto a two-hundred-car train to be thrown into the sea.</t5390>
<t5391>With a look of pity, the priest looked at him:</t5391>
<t5392>- Oh! My child? - the father sighed, - for me, just knowing for sure that you and I are existing in this moment is enough, more than enough?</t5392>
<t5393>So Auréliano and Amaranta Úrsula accepted the story of the basket as proof of Auréliano's origins, not because they believed it but because it had the effect of bringing peace to their souls.</t5393><t5394>As the fetus grew larger, they became so close that they were like one, increasingly merging themselves into the solitude of a rickety house that could collapse with just a gust of wind.</t5394><t5395>They restricted their activities to the truly necessary spaces, meaning from Fernanda's bedroom, where hours of serene pleasure lit up, to the hallway, where Amaranta Úrsula sat sewing shoes and hats for the newborn, and where Auréliano sat writing responses to the letters from the wise old man from Catalonia, which he only occasionally received.</t5395><t5396>The rest of the house had surrendered to the destructive forces of nature that were tightening their grip.</t5396><t5397>The jewelry workshop, Melquíades' room, the primordial and silent realms of Santa</t5397><t5398>Sofía de la Piedad, all were engulfed in a wild forest existing right inside the house that no one dared to step into.</t5398><t5399>Besieged by savage nature, Auréliano and Amaranta Úrsula continued to plant marjoram and defended their world with chalk lines to erect the last bastions of the age-old war between humans and red ants.</t5399><t5400>Her long hair unkempt, her face bruised with blood clots, her feet swollen and sore in the morning, her once sleek and loving body now sagging, all these things had stripped Amaranta Úrsula of the youthful appearance she had when she returned home with the unfortunate canary cage and the obedient husband, but they had not changed her inner strength. "Damn it," she would often joke, "Who would have thought that we would end up living like cannibals."</t5400><t5401>The last thread binding them to the outside world was severed when the pregnancy reached seven months, when they received a letter, but it was clearly not from the wise old man from Catalonia.</t5401><t5402>The envelope, sent from Barcelona, was torn at the edges, but because it was written in a neat hand with blue ink, it looked appealing.</t5402><t5403>It had a simple appearance and no sender's name, like letters from an enemy.</t5403><t5404>Auréliano snatched the letter from Amaranta Úrsula's hand just as she was about to open it.</t5404>
<t5405>- I don't like this letter, - Aureliano said.</t5405> <t5406>- I don't want to know what it says.</t5406>
<t5407>As he had foreseen, the wise old man from Catalonia did not write to him.</t5407><t5408>The strange letter, which no one had read, lay on the shelf where Fernanda had once forgotten her wedding ring, left to be gnawed by cockroaches and to continue lying there to self-destruct in the internal fire of bad news, while the lonely lovers swam against the current of time in those final days, unchanging and unfortunate, swiftly passing in a futile effort to cast them into the void of boredom and oblivion.</t5408><t5409>Fully aware of this threat, Aureliano and Amaranta Úrsula lived hand in hand until the final months, perfecting the conception of their two sons with faithful love that had begun in the throes of carnal frenzy.</t5409><t5410>At night, they embraced each other in bed, unafraid of the loud noises of the ants building nests, the buzzing of the cockroaches, or the groaning and echoing sounds of weeds growing in the adjacent rooms.</t5410><t5411>Many times, they were awakened by the wandering ghosts.</t5411><t5412>They heard Úrsula fighting against the laws of creation to maintain her lineage, heard José Arcadio Buendía searching for the elusive truth of great inventions, heard Fernanda murmuring prayers, heard Colonel Aureliano Buendía dazed by the deceit of war and the golden fishes, heard Aureliano Segundo exhausted by loneliness in his wild revelries, and thus they understood that these primary obsessions held value against death, and they were happy with the clear thought that they would continue to love each other with their essence after death, when some future species would help them eradicate the pests that were wiping out the people in this wretched paradise.</t5412>
<t5413>At six o'clock in the evening on a Sunday, Amaranta Úrsula went into labor.</t5413> <t5414>The cheerful midwife of the girls who made a living by entertaining had placed her on the dining table, then straddled her belly, pounding on her until her cries were drowned out by the wails of the chubby newborn.</t5414> <t5415>Through her tears, Amaranta Úrsula saw that it was a Buendía of the great Buendías, strong and determined like José Arcadio, with wide-open, bright eyes like those of the Aurelianos, ready to renew the lineage from the beginning, ready to purify the dangerous vices and the tendency towards solitude of their family, for this child was the only one in a century conceived out of love.</t5415>
<t5416>- It is entirely a cannibal, - she said, - will name it Rodrigo.</t5416>
<t5417>- No, - her husband objected, - we will name him Aureliano and he will win all thirty-two wars.</t5417>
<t5418>After cutting its umbilical cord, the midwife immediately took a rag to wipe off the greenish fluid covering its entire body.</t5418> <t5419>Aureliano held a lamp for her to work.</t5419> <t5420>It was only when they turned the infant over that everyone noticed it had something completely different from other men.</t5420> <t5421>So they bent down to take a closer look.</t5421> <t5422>It was a pig's tail.</t5422>
<t5423>They were not worried at all.</t5423> <t5424>Aureliano and Amaranta Úrsula did not know much about their family background nor did they remember Úrsula's heartfelt reminders, and the midwife comforted them with the prediction that the useless tail would fall off when the child lost its baby teeth.</t5424> <t5425>After that, they did not have the chance to think about the pig's tail, because Amaranta Úrsula was bleeding uncontrollably.</t5425> <t5426>Using spider webs and water-soaked ashes, they tried to save her but to no avail; it was as futile as trying to stop a gushing water spout with one's hand.</t5426> <t5427>In the early hours, she tried to maintain a cheerful demeanor.</t5427> <t5428>She held Aureliano's panicked hand, begging him not to worry, telling him that someone like her was not born to die against her will, and then she mocked the midwife's naive measures.</t5428> <t5429>But as Aureliano's hope dwindled, her figure gradually blurred as if she was being erased by light, until she sank into a coma.</t5429> <t5430>On the morning of the second day, they brought a woman to her bedside to pray fervent prayers, clearly naming people and animals, but Amaranta Úrsula's fervor remained impervious to all artificial acts unlike love.</t5430> <t5431>On the afternoon of the second day, after twenty-four hours of anxiety and despair, they knew she had died because the blood in her had drained beyond recovery, and her profile hardened, the wrinkles on her face disappeared, turning her face into a pale white sun, and she smiled again.</t5431>
<t5432>Up until this moment, Aureliano hadn't realized how much he loved his friends, how much he needed them, and how much he longed to see them.</t5432> <t5433>He placed the infant in the basket that its mother had prepared, covered the corpse with a shawl, and then wandered aimlessly through the desolate village in search of a ravine that would lead him back to the past.</t5433> <t5434>He knocked on the door of the pharmacy, a place he hadn't visited recently, only to find that it had turned into a carpenter's workshop.</t5434> <t5435>An old woman opened the door for him, holding an oil lamp, pitying him for being lost, and insisted that this was never a pharmacy, that it had never been a pharmacy, and that she had never known a girl with a high-necked collar and dreamy eyes named Mercedes.</t5435> <t5436>He leaned his head against the door of the old wise Catalonian's bookshop to cry, believing that with his belated tears, he was paying off a debt for a death he hadn't wanted to mourn at the time, so as not to interrupt the enchantment of love.</t5436> <t5437>He clenched his fist and struck the brick walls of the house where the Golden Boy, a name given by Pilar Ternera, was kept, not noticing the bright orange discs flying across the sky that he had eagerly watched during a festival night in the courtyard of the herons.</t5437> <t5438>A band of accordions played the songs of Rafael Escalona, the bishop's nephew, and the successor of Francisco the Man at the now deserted outdoor tavern in the gambling neighborhood.</t5438> <t5439>The tavern owner, with a withered arm as if scarred by fire from having used it to harm his mother, invited Aureliano to share a bottle of strong liquor, and afterward, Aureliano invited him to share another bottle.</t5439> <t5440>The tavern owner told Aureliano about the misfortune of his arm.</t5440> <t5441>Aureliano told him about the misfortune of his heart, withered and scarred from having used it to harm his sister's life.</t5441> <t5442>After sharing their stories, they cried together, and Aureliano suddenly felt his inner pain ease.</t5442> <t5443>But when he stood alone in the final dawn of Macondo, he spread his arms wide in the middle of the square, ready to awaken the entire world, and with all his soul, he screamed:</t5443>
<t5444>- Friends are a bunch of bastards.</t5444>
<t5445>The necromancer pulled him out of the slimy mud of vomit and tears.</t5445><t5446>She took him to his room, cleaned him up, and gave him a glass of sugarcane juice.</t5446><t5447>She used charcoal to erase the marks of the debts he owed after countless times of sleeping with her, thinking that by doing so she would comfort him, and she evoked lonely sorrows in a comforting way so that he wouldn't have to cry alone.</t5447><t5448>When he woke up after a restless and short sleep, Aureliano realized he had a headache.</t5448><t5449>He opened his eyes and remembered the infant.</t5449><t5450>He did not see the infant in the basket.</t5450><t5451>Suddenly, he was overwhelmed with joy, believing that Amaranta Úrsula had come back from the dead to take care of the child.</t5451><t5452>But the corpse, like a stone, still lay under the shawl.</t5452><t5453>Remembering clearly that when he got home, he had seen the bedroom door wide open, Aureliano quickly walked through the hallway filled with the morning scent of marjoram, peered into the dining room where the mess from the childbirth was still scattered: the large pan, the blood-stained bed sheets, the ash buckets, and the shriveled umbilical cord of the infant lying on a diaper spread out on the table next to the scissors and spool of thread.</t5453><t5454>The thought that the midwife had returned to hold the baby throughout the night brought him a bit of peace to think.</t5454><t5455>He threw himself onto the wicker rocking chair, the very same chair where Rebeca had once sat to teach embroidery to her friends in the early days of the family, where Amaranta played checkers with Colonel Gerineldo Márquez, where Amaranta Úrsula sewed baby clothes, and in a brilliant flash of insight, he realized that he could no longer bear the weight of the past pressing on his soul.</t5455><t5456>Weary from the deadly spears of his own and others' nostalgia, Aureliano gazed in wonder at the stubborn cobwebs covering the dead rose garden, the persistent weeds growing wildly everywhere, and the tranquil air enveloping the fiery February morning.</t5456><t5457>And then he saw the infant.</t5457><t5458>By now, it was nothing more than a dry, swollen skin, being carried away by ants from all over the earth, who were laboriously transporting it along rocky paths back to their nest.</t5458><t5459>Aureliano could not move.</t5459><t5460>He could not move, not because of the terrifying fear that kept him still, but because in that magical moment, the precise codes of Melquíades appeared before his eyes, and the script written on those parchments was arranged accurately in the time and space of human beings: The first of the line is tied to a tree and the last is being eaten by ants.</t5460>
<t5461>In any action in his life, Aureliano had never been as clear-headed as when he forgot his deceased loved ones and their sorrow, took Fernanda's door bolt to lock all the doors and stay inside because at that moment he understood his fate had been written on Melquiades' parchments. He saw them pristine, lying next to prehistoric trees and damp mud puddles with glowing insects that had expelled all traces of human presence from the room, and he no longer had the composure to bring the parchments into the light. Instead, he stood there, still seeing the letters clearly, as if they were written in Spanish under the bright midday light.</t5461> <t5462>He began to read aloud the encoded pages.</t5462> <t5463>It was the story of the family, written by Melquiades in meticulous detail down to the smallest particulars a hundred years earlier.</t5463> <t5464>He had written it in Sanskrit, his native language, encoding the rhymed poems of Emperor Augustus with his own cipher and the unrhymed poems with the Greek military code. Melquiades' ultimate intention, which Aureliano began to realize when he stopped letting his love for Amaranta Úrsula confuse him, lay in the fact that Melquiades did not arrange the events chronologically but instead concentrated a century's worth of daily occurrences to coexist at once.</t5464> <t5465>Excited by his achievement, Aureliano read aloud, without stumbling, the elegies that Melquiades himself had read to Arcadio, which were actually prophecies of his execution. Then he read the foretelling of the birth of the most beautiful woman in the world who would completely ascend.</t5465>
<t5466>-- The End -</t5466><t5467>-</t5467>
