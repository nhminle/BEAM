<t0>Introduction of the Author and the Work</t0>
<t1>Jane Austen was born on December 16, 1775, in Steventon, Hants, England, and was the seventh of eight children of Reverend George Austen (1731-1805), who managed the Steventon parish, and Cassandra Leigh (1739-1827).</t1> <t2>The closest person in the author's life was her sister Cassandra; neither of them ever married.</t2> <t3>Their father was a scholar who always encouraged his children's curiosity.</t3> <t4>However, the author did not receive much formal education from school but was mainly taught by her father and had the opportunity to read many books.</t4> <t5>The lively and loving family atmosphere, combined with extensive relationships with relatives and friends, provided the backdrop for the author's works.</t5>
<t6>J</t6>
<t7>From a young age, Jane Austen began writing short plays and sketches to entertain her family, followed by a few poems and prose.</t7> <t8>The author used the backdrop of her own life - the countryside, parish, neighbors, and rural towns, along with visits to the cities of Bath and London to gather material for the situations, characters, and themes in her works.</t8>
<t9>The work Sense and Sensibility was written in 1784 under the title Elinor and Marianne, with many additions until it was published in 1811, only listing the author as "a lady," and at the author's own expense.</t9> <t10>Similarly, the novel Pride and Prejudice was drafted during 1796-1797 and first published in 1813.</t10> <t11>Additionally, Mansfield Park was published in 1814, and Emma in 1815. (The translations of Pride and Prejudice and Emma have been released by the Writers' Association Publishing House along with this translation.) A reputable literary critic praised the "nameless author" as having a marvelous pen in the new tradition of modern realism.</t11> <t12>All works published while Jane Austen was alive still bore the name of an anonymous author.</t12> <t13>After the author's death, her real name first appeared in 1817, on the novel Persuasion.</t13>
<t14>Living with his family throughout his life, the author contracted Addison's disease (adrenal gland degeneration) in 1816 and passed away on July 18, 1817, at the age of only 42.</t14>
<t15>Although praised by some contemporary literary critics, the author received little public attention during her lifetime.</t15> <t16>About three decades after the author's death, world opinion began to offer more serious and enthusiastic reviews, and from then until now, Jane Austen has been regarded as one of the most outstanding novelists in English literature. Many clubs of Jane Austen enthusiasts have been established in Argentina, Australia, Japan, the United States... and of course, in the United Kingdom.</t16>
<t17>Jane Austen is considered a writer who brought to the novel a unique modern character through her humorous writing style to criticize the vices of everyday life.</t17> <t18>Literary critics praise the author's novels for their moral value as well as their entertaining nature; they also love the realistic portrayal of human personalities and highly appreciate the simple realism.</t18> <t19>These styles provide readers with a refreshing change compared to the exaggerated romantic writing that was prevalent at the time.</t19> <t20>While the English novel emerged in the early 18th century, Jane Austen's works created a fresh atmosphere through the realistic depiction of average people in ordinary settings.</t20>
<t21>Specifically, Jane Austen constructed a humorous framework of the English middle class during her time, pioneering the trend for "family novels" by delving into the manners, character, and tensions between female characters and the society they lived in.</t21> <t22>Jane Austen broke away from the literary motifs of her era, which typically portrayed female characters as always virtuous, love stories as always romantic, and random events as plot twists.</t22> <t23>This characteristic made her novels more closely related to the contemporary world than to the traditions of the 18th century.</t23>
<t24>In summary, through Jane Austen's works, readers can recognize "earthly" characters, neither wonderful nor terrible, but complex, in the context of love and romance influenced by economics and human nature, through which they exhibit the "talents" and "shortcomings"</t24><t25>that family and society have helped shape in them.</t25>
<t26>To understand the literary significance of Jane Austen, it might be helpful to look at the broader context.</t26> <t27>In the author's time, women had little chance of advancing in British society: professional careers, universities, politics, the military... all were closed off to women.</t27> <t28>Many girls received little formal schooling and were mainly taught at home by parents or tutors (the author included).</t28> <t29>The few professions women could participate in (such as teaching children and living with the employer) were not highly regarded.</t29> <t30>Women from "respectable" families could only hope for a good social standing through inheritance or marriage.</t30> <t31>However, the inheritance of entire estates was reserved for men according to familial hierarchy; women typically inherited household items, at most a small sum of money.</t31>
<t32>There is only one way left to ensure a future for a daughter: marry a rich man! This gives rise to the great concern of mothers with daughters, to the extent that mothers in Jane Austen's stories do not teach their daughters much about love and marriage, with the notion that daughters only need to be beautiful to marry rich! On the other hand, wealthy young men also face family pressure to marry someone of equivalent social standing.</t32> <t33>These contexts have created the premise for the author to satirize and empathize.</t33>
<t34>Unmarried daughters had to endure many restrictions due to the customs of that time: if they wanted to ride a horse, they had to have a servant ride along (additional cost!), when traveling far if there was no elder, they had to have a well-mannered nanny accompany them, and they were not allowed to write letters to any young man without an engagement...</t34> <t35>And as daughters of well-educated families, they only studied literature, arts, and domestic skills... while waiting for marriage!</t35>
<t36>Life among the middle class (often landowners) was troublesome in that, because they did not have to work much, middle-class families often organized gatherings, balls, picnics... and then gossiped with each other, from which they would often discuss and joke about each other's private matters.</t36> <t37>The consequence was that unmarried girls had to endure additional pressure from public opinion, which was very conservative in a society that mainly still lived off agriculture.</t37> <t38>Perhaps that is why Jane Austen did not want to put her name on her works while she was alive, because with her satirical take on worldly ways, she would hardly have been able to live peacefully with the surrounding society if her identity were revealed!</t38>
<t39>Also being from a middle-class, well-educated family, Jane Austen must have deeply understood the plight of women like that, so she created characters that literary critics call "female heroes."</t39> <t40>These are young girls from families with limited material wealth, but who are strong-willed or stubborn, indifferent to wealthy young men or defiant of customs and prejudices.</t40> <t41>They want to express their true selves: self-reliant - even proud - rather than desperately seeking a wealthy marriage, even if their mothers pressure or trouble them!</t41> <t42>Some become liberal, living for their own emotions rather than forcing themselves to follow "customs and traditions."</t42> <t43>In love, they receive very little guidance or instruction and must discover for themselves, then act on their own to solve their personal issues.</t43>
<t44>The final good thing about these "female heroes" is that they also stumble, but they also know how to recognize their own mistakes and forgive the mistakes of others.</t44>
<t45>The story "Sense and Sensibility" revolves around two sisters, Elinor and Marianne.</t45> <t46>While the elder sister Elinor primarily lives based on reason (perception), always cautious, and knows how to restrain her emotions; the younger sister Marianne acts in a very romantic manner according to her feelings, indulging in her sensations to the point of recklessness - a trait that provides the author with a broad scope for satire and empathy.</t46> <t47>The satirical tone on society in this story has reached a higher level compared to other works by Jane Austen.</t47> <t48>How each young woman copes with emotional misfortunes and learns lessons for herself forms the crux of the story.</t48> <t49>Although Marianne, with her disregard for social conventions, may become appealing to readers in a more liberal era, the author intends to highlight the character of Elinor.</t49> <t50>The influence of parents on their children (either too indulgent or too strict) during this period in England is also depicted quite clearly.</t50> <t51>Through the intertwining of two sisters with distinctly different qualities in each emotional upheaval and the practical needs and limitations of women within the social context of 18th-century England, Jane Austen has established the premise that happiness can only be achieved with a balance between perception and sensation (or as we often say, between sense and sensibility).</t51>
<t52>Based on this story, the film Sense and Sensibility was made in 1995, with Emma Thompson as Elinor, Kate Winslet as Marianne, and Hugh Grant as Edward.</t52> <t53>Emma Thompson also wrote the screenplay for the film.</t53> <t54>The film was awarded best film, director, lead actress, and screenplay by the National Board of Review, the Directors Guild of America, and the Film Critics Associations of New York City, Los Angeles, Boston, and others.</t54> <t55>The film won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture and Best Screenplay.</t55> <t56>At the 1995 Oscars, the film was nominated in 7 categories and won the award for Best Screenplay.</t56>
<t57>Translator's note: - It can be said that many sentences and phrases of Jane Austen are very polished, profound, even abstract, with a touch of witty satire, which readers need to ponder and think about with both awareness and perception to discover the hidden Truth, Goodness, and Beauty in the author's writing style.</t57> <t58>Even some English and American people admit that they are not very interested in following the details of this story when they first read the original English version.</t58> <t59>Therefore, readers should not rush through Jane Austen's pages to immediately grasp the plot or follow the next developments of the events.</t59> <t60>Doing so will be counterproductive.</t60> <t61>Although the original writing style has been somewhat adapted in the translation to contemporary style for clearer expression of the author's intended meaning, readers should still appreciate - rather than complain about - this 18th-century writing style, which is represented by an author ranked among the top in English literature of all time.</t61>

<t63>Chapter 1</t63>
<t64>The Dashwood family had long been settled in Sussex.</t64> <t65>They had a large estate, their residence located at Norland Park, amidst the land they owned, where many generations had lived in a respectable manner, earning the goodwill of the surrounding families.</t65> <t66>The owner of this estate was a single man, who lived to a fairly old age, and for many years had his sister living with him to keep him company and manage his household.</t66> <t67>But this sister had died ten years before he passed away, bringing profound changes to his home; to compensate for the loss, he invited the family of his nephew, Henry Dashwood, to live with him.</t67> <t68>Henry was the heir to the Norland estate by law, and also the person he intended to bequeath it to.</t68> <t69>With the presence of his nephew's family, including his wife and children, the old man's final days were comfortable.</t69> <t70>He grew increasingly fond of them.</t70> <t71>Henry Dashwood and his wife attended to all the old man's wishes, not merely out of self-interest, but also out of a genuine desire to provide him with all the comfort his advanced age could receive; and the lively children added joy to his life.</t71>
<t72>G</t72>
<t73>Mr. Henry Daswood had one son from his first marriage and three daughters from his second marriage.</t73> <t74>The young man had a steady temperament and was well-respected, being adequately provided for by his mother's substantial estate, half of which was allocated to him upon reaching adulthood.</t74> <t75>Likewise, through his marriage shortly after reaching adulthood, his estate was further increased.</t75> <t76>Therefore, inheriting the Norland estate was not as crucial for him as it was for his half-sisters; for they only inherited a small portion from their father.</t76> <t77>Their mother had no estate, and their father only had £7000; because the remaining small portion of the first wife's estate was reserved for her son, while he only enjoyed the income generated from this amount.</t77>
<t78>When the old man passed away, his will was opened and read, and, like most other wills, it created both disappointment and joy.</t78> <t79>He was neither biased nor ungrateful, withholding the portion of the estate that the grandchild deserved; but he left the grandchild to inherit through provisions that reduced the inheritance value by half.</t79>
<t80>Mr. Henry Daswood had wished for more for his wife and three daughters and less for himself or his son.</t80> <t81>This son, along with his four-year-old child, inherited in such a way that he no longer had any authority to provide for those dearest to him—those who needed provision the most through portions of the estate or through the sale of valuable timber on his land.</t81> <t82>Everything was allocated to that child, who had won the affection of his grandfather through visits to his parents in Norland, affections that were nothing unusual for a two or three-year-old child: innocent speech, a lively temperament wanting to have his own way, many amusing antics and much noise, as if overshadowing all the value of the care and attention that the old man had received for many years from his granddaughter and her three daughters.</t82>
<t83>However, the old man was not mean-spirited, and to show his affection for the three girls, he left 1000 pounds to each of them.</t83>
<t84>Mr. Daswood was initially deeply disappointed but appeared cheerful and confident: he had reason to hope to live many more years, and if he lived frugally, he could build up a considerable amount from the extensive and profitable land, which almost immediately had the potential to improve the situation.</t84> <t85>But because it was created too late, the estate lasted only 12 months.</t85> <t86>He only outlived his uncle by such a short time, and his widow and daughters were left with only 10,000 pounds, including future inheritances.</t86>
<t87>The son of the man was summoned immediately when he recognized the perilous state of his condition and, with all the strength and urgency that his severe illness allowed, Mr. Daswood urged him regarding the rights of his stepmother and his three half-sisters.</t87>
<t88>Mr. John Dashwood did not have any close emotional ties with the remaining members of the family; but he was influenced by the suggestion made in such a manner and under such circumstances, and he promised to do everything within his power to ensure they lived comfortably.</t88> <t89>The father felt relieved by this promise, and Mr. John Dashwood had ample time to calculate how he could exercise his abilities prudently to take care of them.</t89>
<t90>He was not a callous young man; it was merely his indifference and considerable selfishness that made him appear so. Generally, he was respected because he was conscious of properly fulfilling his usual obligations.</t90> <t91>If he had married a more compassionate wife, he might have been more esteemed, and he himself might have become more amiable; all because he married at a young age and deeply loved his wife.</t91> <t92>But Mrs. John Dashwood turned out to be a caricature of him: narrower-minded and more selfish.</t92>
<t93>When he promised his father, he planned to increase the inheritance of each half-sister by 1000 pounds.</t93> <t94>At that time, he thought he was truly capable of doing this.</t94> <t95>The prospect of 4000 pounds per year added to his current income, not to mention half of his late mother's estate, warmed his heart and made him feel generous. "Yes, he would give the three sisters 3000 pounds, a generous and seemingly significant amount.</t95> <t96>Enough to help the three sisters live comfortably. 3000 pounds!</t96> <t97>He could allocate such a large sum without much effort."</t97>
<t98>He thought about this all day, and for many days afterwards he did not regret it.</t98>
<t99>Immediately after her husband's father's funeral was over, John Daswood's wife, along with her child and servants, moved in without informing her husband's stepmother.</t99> <t100>No one could question her right to move in: the estate had belonged to her husband since the moment the old man passed away, but what was notable was her lack of tact.</t100> <t101>For a woman in Mrs. Daswood's situation, even ordinary feelings would be enough to cause discomfort; moreover, her sense of honor, a notion so encompassing it bordered on the romantic, made any offense caused or received by anyone a source of unshakable disgust for her.</t101> <t102>John Daswood's wife had never been liked by anyone in her husband's family, and this was even before she had the chance to show them her insensitivity to others' feelings in such a delicate situation.</t102>
<t103>Mrs. Daswood deeply recognized this rude behavior and despised her daughter-in-law terribly, to the point that when she came, she could have moved elsewhere, if not for her eldest daughter advising her to reconsider. Then, her love for her three daughters made her decide to stay; and also for their sake, she wanted to avoid a rift in the relationship with their brother.</t103>
<t104>Elinor, the eldest daughter with very useful advice, has a strong quality through her empathy and calmness in judgment.</t104> <t105>Therefore, despite being only 19 years old, she has become an advisor to her mother, thereby helping everyone as she counterbalances Mrs. Dashwood's often imprudent exuberance.</t105> <t106>She has a kind heart; affectionate temperament and resolute spirit, but she knows how to restrain herself.</t106> <t107>This is an awareness that her mother has yet to grasp and her younger sisters still do not wish to be taught.</t107>
<t108>The abilities of her stepsister Marianne are quite similar to Elinor in many aspects.</t108> <t109>She is sensitive, intelligent, but passionate in everything: her sorrows and joys have no bounds.</t109> <t110>She is generous, likable, and attentive; she possesses many virtues except for a lack of caution.</t110> <t111>She is very much like her mother in this regard.</t111>
<t112>Elinor worriedly realized that her sister was overly sensitive, but in their mother's eyes, this was something to be valued and praised.</t112> <t113>The mother and daughter encouraged each other in the way they were closely bonded.</t113> <t114>The concerns that initially troubled them were later cherished, and they sought more pain, continually creating more pain.</t114> <t115>They completely indulged in their sorrow, tormented further by sorrowful thoughts, and refused to accept anyone's advice.</t115> <t116>Elinor was also deeply affected, but she still resisted and was able to overcome it on her own.</t116> <t117>She could consult her brother, welcome her sister-in-law and treat her kindly, and try to encourage her mother to do the same, urging her to endure as she did.</t117>
<t118>Youngest sister Margaret has a cheerful disposition and good intentions towards everyone; however, influenced by Marianne's romantic notions and lacking awareness, at the age of 13, she is not yet aligned with her two sisters in this stage of her childhood.</t118>
<t119>Chapter 2</t119>
<t120>John Daswood's wife now became the mistress of Norland; the mother and the sisters-in-law were relegated to the status of guests.</t120> <t121>Nevertheless, she still treated them politely; her husband continued to treat them kindly in the way he tried to treat anyone other than himself, his wife, and his son.</t121> <t122>He earnestly and sincerely urged them to consider Norland as their own home.</t122> <t123>Everyone accepted his invitation because there was no other option but for Mrs. Daswood to remain there until she found another place to live in the area.</t123>
<t124>C</t124>
<t125>Being able to continue staying in the place that evoked all her beautiful memories was exactly what she desired.</t125> <t126>In joyful moments, she was happier than anyone else, and if it was solely due to that happiness, no one felt happier than she did.</t126> <t127>But when she was sorrowful, she was also drawn by her imagination in a way that no one could console her, similar to how no one could make her restrain herself when she was elated.</t127>
<t128>John Daswood's wife did not accept his intention regarding his sisters at all.</t128> <t129>Taking away 3000 pounds from their beloved son would certainly impoverish him to a dreadful extent.</t129> <t130>She pleaded with him to reconsider.</t130> <t131>How could he justify himself when he had taken away the largest sum of money from his son, and that was their only child?</t131> <t132>And the Daswood sisters, who were only half-sisters and whom she did not consider close relatives, what right did they have to receive such a large sum out of generosity?</t132> <t133>Many people knew well that one could not expect affection between children from different marriages; so why would he ruin himself and their poor little son Harry by giving all his money to his half-sisters?</t133>
<t134>Her husband replied:</t134>
<t135>- That was the father's final wish, that you should support his widow and his daughters.</t135>
<t136>- You could say that he didn't know what he was talking about, but one thing is certain: at that moment, he was not clear-headed.</t136> <t137>If he had been more aware, he probably wouldn't have had the thought to insist that you give away half of your son's inheritance.</t137>
<t138>- Dear Fanny, he did not mention any amount of money.</t138> <t139>He only asked you, in general terms, to support them, to make them more comfortable than he could.</t139> <t140>Perhaps it was as if he left it to your discretion to handle.</t140> <t141>Surely he also thought that you could not neglect them.</t141> <t142>But since he asked you to promise, you could not refuse; at least that’s what you thought at the time.</t142> <t143>So you promised, and you must keep your word.</t143> <t144>You have to do something for them when they leave Norland and settle into their new residence.</t144>
<t145>- So, we will do something for them, but it doesn't necessarily have to be 3000 pounds.</t145> <t146>Think about it, once money is gone, it never comes back.</t146> <t147>The girls will get married, and then the money is lost forever.</t147> <t148>If we could recover it for our poor son...</t148>
<t149>The dignified husband:</t149>
<t150>- Surely, this will be a big difference.</t150> <t151>There will come a time when Harry regrets losing such a large sum of money.</t151> <t152>Suppose, if he had a large family, having this extra money would be significant.</t152>
<t153>- In that case, it might be better for all parties if we reduce the amount by half. 500 pounds would still be a significant addition to their estate.</t153>
<t154>- Oh, that's great.</t154> <t155>Is there any brother in this world who would want to share even half of this amount with his sisters, even with his own siblings?</t155> <t156>While here - just a half-sibling! But you are generous.</t156>
<t157>He replied:</t157>
<t158>- He didn't want to appear stingy.</t158> <t159>In such situations, people want to do better rather than worse.</t159> <t160>At the very least, no one could think he hadn't helped them enough: even they would find it hard to expect more.</t160>
<t161>The ex-wife said:</t161>
<t162>- There is no way to know what they wish for, but we should not think about what they want: the issue is how capable you are.</t162>
<t163>- Surely, and I think I am capable of giving each of them 5000 pounds.</t163> <t164>In fact, even without any additional amount from me, each of them will have over 3000 pounds when their mother passes away: a rather comfortable amount for any girl.</t164>
<t165>- That's right, and what I mean is that perhaps they don't wish for anything more.</t165> <t166>They will have 10,000 pounds to share among themselves.</t166> <t167>If they get married, they will certainly be comfortable; if not, they can live very comfortably on the interest from 10,000 pounds.</t167>
<t168>- You are absolutely right, which is why I'm not sure whether I should do something for their mother while she is still alive instead of for them; I mean the amount she receives periodically.</t168> <t169>His sisters would be just as pleased as she is. 100 pounds a year would also make them completely comfortable.</t169>
<t170>The wife hesitated a little, but in the end, she agreed to this plan.</t170> <t171>She said:</t171>
<t172>- Of course, it's better than paying 1500 pounds all at once.</t172> <t173>But hey, if Mrs. Daswood lives another 15 years, we will be completely trapped.</t173>
<t174>- 15 years! Dear Fanny, your life isn't worth half that amount!</t174>
<t175>- Certainly not, but if you notice, people always live longer when they receive an annuity; while she is still plump and healthy, not yet 40.</t175> <t176>An annuity is a very serious matter, it must be paid regularly every year, there is no way to cancel it.</t176> <t177>You are not fully aware of what you are doing. I know there are many troubles caused by annuities; because my mother was burdened with the misery of having to pay for the old servants according to my father's will, and it was quite strange to see how upset she was about it.</t177> <t178>These payments are made twice a year; then there is the hassle of ensuring the money reaches them; then hearing that one of these people has passed away, only to find out it wasn't true.</t178> <t179>My mother has grown very tired of this.</t179> <t180>She says her income is not truly her own because of these endless payments.</t180> <t181>My father became more stringent, because if not, the money would be entirely at my mother's disposal, without any constraints.</t181> <t182>This has made me so averse to annuities that I don't want to be involved in them myself.</t182>
<t183>Mr. Daswood replied:</t183>
<t184>- It is indeed an unpleasant matter when our income is annually reduced by such expenses.</t184> <t185>My mother was right, people have income that doesn't entirely belong to them.</t185> <t186>Being tied to paying such an amount, on every rent payment day, is truly troublesome: it makes people lose their autonomy.</t186>
<t187>- Surely that's the case. In the end, no one owes anyone anything.</t187> <t188>They think their lives are secure, assuming that what you do is nothing more than your duty, and they don't feel grateful to you.</t188> <t189>If I were you, any decision I make should be my own.</t189> <t190>I wouldn't bind myself to give them anything each year.</t190> <t191>There might be a year when we struggle to spend 100, or even 50 pounds.</t191>
<t192>- My love, I believe you are right; it might be better if we don't have to pay periodically.</t192> <t193>Any amount I occasionally spend on them will have greater support value than an annual amount, because they will only live more lavishly if they are certain of a large income, and by the end of the year, they won't be any richer.</t193> <t194>There surely is a better way.</t194> <t195>Occasionally giving them a sum of 50 pounds will help them avoid hardship, and I think this will be enough to help me keep my promise to my father.</t195>
<t196>-I'm sure of it. In fact, I firmly believe that your father never intended for you to give them money.</t196> <t197>I am certain that the support he had in mind was only to a certain extent; for example, finding them a small, comfortable house, helping them move, giving them fish you caught or game you hunted, depending on the season.</t197> <t198>I am sure that the old man had no other intentions; in fact, if he did, it would be strange and unreasonable.</t198>
<t199>"Dear Mr. Daswood, please consider how comfortably your stepmother and her daughters can live on the interest from £7000, plus £1000 for each daughter, giving each daughter £50, which they would naturally use to pay for their mother's housing.</t199> <t200>All together, they would have £500 per year; what more could four women want?</t200> <t201>They would live with very low expenses!</t201> <t202>House maintenance costs would be negligible.</t202> <t203>They would not have a carriage, no horses, scarcely any servants, no relatives living with them, and no such expenses at all! Just think about how comfortably they would live! £500 per year!</t203> <t204>I cannot imagine how they would spend even half of that amount; and then you give them more, it's truly absurd.</t204> <t205>They have more than enough to give you a portion."</t205>
<t206>Mr. Daswood said:</t206>
<t207>Trust me, I think you are completely right.</t207> <t208>When he made the request, the father surely had no other intention than what you mentioned.</t208> <t209>Now I fully understand, and I will fulfill my responsibilities through the support and kindness you described.</t209> <t210>When my stepmother moves to another house, I will help her settle in as best as I can.</t210> <t211>A few small pieces of furniture might also be acceptable for them.</t211>
<t212>Miss Dashwood responded:</t212>
<t213>- That's right.</t213> <t214>However, one thing needs to be considered.</t214> <t215>When his father and stepmother moved to Norland, although the furniture at Stanhill was sold off, every piece of dishware and bedding was kept and is now handed over to the mother.</t215> <t216>Therefore, her new house will be almost fully furnished as soon as she moves in.</t216>
<t217>- Surely that is a practical consideration.</t217> <t218>A truly valuable inheritance! And yet, we should have had the right to use some of these dishes.</t218>
<t219>- Yes, the porcelain breakfast set is worth twice as much as the one we have in this house.</t219> <t220>I think it's too luxurious for any place they could afford to rent.</t220> <t221>Well, we have to accept it.</t221> <t222>Your father only thinks about them.</t222> <t223>I have to say this: you don't owe him anything, you don't need to think about his wishes; because we know very well that if he could, he would have left almost everything in this world to them.</t223>
<t224>It is impossible to counter this argument.</t224> <t225>It gave him the motivation that he had not been able to decide on until now.</t225> <t226>Finally, he firmly decided that it was completely unnecessary, if not improper, to help the widow and her children more than the level of support according to neighborly relations as his wife had outlined.</t226>
<t227>Chapter 3</t227>
<t228>Mrs. Dashwood stayed at Norland for several months.</t228> <t229>It was not because she did not want to leave when all the familiar scenes no longer moved her as intensely as before; for when her mind was at ease again and she had other concerns instead of nostalgic memories, she was eager to go, tirelessly inquiring about a suitable stable place in the Norland area; because she could not move far away from this beloved place.</t229> <t230>But she could not find any place that could meet her requirements for comfort and convenience, and that was suitable to the prudence of her eldest daughter, whose judgment steadfastly rejected several houses that were too large for their income, otherwise the mother would have accepted them.</t230>
<t231>B</t231>
<t232>Mrs. Daswood had been informed by her husband about the solemn promise of his son, which had brought him relief after his final worldly thoughts.</t232> <t233>She did not doubt the sincerity of his promise to the extent that he doubted himself, and she was pleased to think that this would greatly help her children, although she believed that an amount less than 7000 pounds would be sufficient for her to live comfortably.</t233> <t234>She was also pleased with the affection of her husband's stepson, happy for his sentiments, and reproached herself for having been unfair to him before, thinking that he was not generous.</t234> <t235>His attentive attitude towards her and his sisters had convinced her that he cared about their well-being, and, over time, she firmly believed in his generous intentions.</t235>
<t236>The disdain of the mother-in-law towards her daughter-in-law, which began from the moment they first met, grew heavier as she understood more about her personality over the half-year they lived together under one roof.</t236> <t237>Even considering the historical status of the daughter-in-law or the feelings of the mother, perhaps the two women would still feel they could not live together for such a long time, if not for a special circumstance that - according to the mother’s imagination - would create the legitimate conditions for her children to continue staying at Norland.</t237>
<t238>This situation is the increasingly close relationship between the eldest daughter of the lady and the brother of her sister-in-law, John Daswood, a pleasant and amiable young man, who was introduced to them shortly after his sister moved to Norland, and since then he has been a frequent visitor.</t238>
<t239>Some mothers would have certainly encouraged the two to be friendly with each other out of self-interest, because Edward Ferrars was the eldest son of a very wealthy deceased father; while others would have certainly restrained themselves out of caution, because his entire fortune, except for some trifling amounts, depended on his mother's will.</t239> <t240>Opinions of any kind did not affect Mrs. Dashwood. To her, if he had a charming character, if he loved her daughter, and if Elinor reciprocated, that was enough. This went against all her preconceived notions that the disparity in wealth would cause every couple to part ways despite having compatible temperaments; and that Elinor's character would not be highly valued by those who knew her, which she believed was completely untrue.</t240>
<t241>Edward Ferras was not highly regarded by anyone, whether tolerant or shrewd, to be introduced to others.</t241> <t242>He was not handsome, and his demeanor required people to be close to him to appreciate him.</t242> <t243>He lacked the confidence to be fair to himself; but when he suppressed his inherent shyness, his character showed all signs of an open and friendly soul.</t243> <t244>He had a sympathetic nature, and the education he received made him even more empathetic.</t244> <t245>But he did not have the ability or temperament to meet the wishes of his mother and sister, who wanted him to stand out... how... they were not sure.</t245> <t246>They wanted him to become a successful person in the world in one way or another.</t246> <t247>His mother wished he would take an interest in politics, hoped he would be elected to parliament, or hoped he would associate with contemporary famous people.</t247> <t248>Mrs. John Daswood shared the same wish, but until that blessing was realized, she was temporarily satisfied to see him riding in a grand carriage.</t248>
<t249>But Edward didn't care about famous people or big carriages.</t249> <t250>All his desires leaned towards a cozy family atmosphere and a quiet private life.</t250> <t251>The fortunate thing was that he had a younger brother with more promise.</t251>
<t252>It took Edward a few weeks of staying in the house before Mrs. Dashwood noticed him, as she was grieving and not paying attention to what was happening around her.</t252> <t253>She only saw that he was quiet and modest, and she liked him for that.</t253> <t254>At first, she observed him, then accepted him further through a casual remark from Elinor about the differences between him and his sister.</t254> <t255>It was this contrast that made her like him.</t255> <t256>She said:</t256>
<t257>- Just assuming that he is not like Fanny is enough to say it all.</t257> <t258>It implicitly points out all the likable things.</t258> <t259>Mother liked him.</t259>
<t260>Elinor said:</t260>
<t261>- I think mom will like him when she understands him better.</t261>
<t262>The mother smiled:</t262>
<t263>- Love him!</t263> <t264>Mom doesn't see any level of acceptance lower than love.</t264>
<t265>- Mother might appreciate you.</t265>
<t266>- Mother has never known what separates respect from love.</t266>
<t267>Now Mrs. Dashwood made an effort to understand him more.</t267> <t268>Her affectionate gestures soon helped him become less reserved.</t268> <t269>She quickly recognized all his virtues; his interest in Elinor perhaps allowed her to be closer to him; but she genuinely believed in his worth.</t269> <t270>Even his calm demeanor, which should have made her think that it was not the character a young man should have, she no longer minded when she knew that he had a warm heart and a gentle temperament.</t270>
<t271>As soon as she recognized the signs of affection in the way he treated Elinor, she considered the serious relationship between the two to be certain, hoping they would quickly move towards marriage.</t271> <t272>She said:</t272>
<t273>- Dear Marianne, in a few months Elinor will very likely be settled.</t273> <t274>We will all miss your sister, but she will be happy.</t274>
<t275>- Oh! Mom, how will we live without her?</t275>
<t276>- My dear, this is not exactly a farewell.</t276> <t277>We will live only a few miles apart, and we will see each other every day for the rest of our lives.</t277> <t278>You will gain a brother-in-law - a true, affectionate brother.</t278> <t279>I have the best impression in the world of Edward's character.</t279> <t280>But Marianne, you seem serious; you don't approve of the man your sister has chosen, do you?</t280>
<t281>Marianne replied:</t281>
<t282>- Perhaps so, you might look at this without much surprise.</t282> <t283>Edward is a very likable person; you have a deep affection for him.</t283> <t284>However, he is not the type of young man- lacking something, his appearance is not outstanding- he does not have the elegance that you would expect from someone seriously committed to your sister.</t284> <t285>His eyes lack the soul, the fire that radiates virtue and intelligence.</t285>
<t286>"And mom, besides these things, I'm afraid he doesn't have a genuine sense of aesthetics.</t286> <t287>It seems he doesn't like music, and although he really likes Elinor's paintings, that's not the way of appreciating them by someone who understands their value.</t287> <t288>Even though he often attentively watches her paint, it's obvious he doesn't know anything about this art.</t288> <t289>He admires in the way of someone in love, not in the way of someone who knows how to appreciate.</t289> <t290>Both must be combined for me to be satisfied."</t290>
<t291>"I cannot feel happy with someone whose aesthetic sense does not coincide with mine.</t291> <t292>He must be able to penetrate my thoughts; both he and I must be passionate about the same books, the same kind of music.</t292> <t293>Oh, mother! Edward looked so soulless and dull when he read poetry to us last night!</t293> <t294>I am very worried about my sister.</t294> <t295>However, she calmly endures it, seemingly indifferent.</t295> <t296>I can hardly sit still.</t296> <t297>To hear those wonderful lines of poetry that usually enchant me, read in such a monotonous, rigid voice, with such a dull, indifferent spirit!"</t297>
<t298>- Surely he could express himself more compellingly with a simple and formal prose style. That's what mother thought at the time, but you should have given him Cowper!</t298>
<t299>- No, mother, I'm afraid he won't become lively because of Cowper either! But we should accept differences in taste.</t299> <t300>Elinor doesn't have the same feelings as I do, so she can overlook this and feel happy with him, but my heart would break hearing him read poetry with so little emotion.</t300> <t301>Mother, the more I understand the world, the more I believe that I will never meet someone I can truly love.</t301> <t302>I demand too much!</t302> <t303>This person must have all of Edward's virtues, plus the personality and demeanor to enhance his qualities in every captivating way.</t303>
<t304>- My dear child, remember that you are not yet 17 years old.</t304> <t305>Too young in life to be so disappointed about happiness. Why should you be more unfortunate than your mother?</t305> <t306>Marianne, I pray that by just one chance, your fate will be different from mine!</t306>
<t307>Chapter 4</t307>
<t308>Marianne said:</t308>
<t309>M</t309>
<t310>- It's truly a pity that Edward doesn't have an eye for art.</t310>
<t311>Elinor replied:</t311>
<t312>- No sense of aesthetics!</t312> <t313>Why do you think so? It's true that he doesn't paint, but he really enjoys looking at other people's paintings, and I can assure you that his sense of aesthetics is not lacking, although he hasn't had the opportunity to cultivate it.</t313> <t314>If he wanted to learn, I think he could paint as well.</t314> <t315>He doesn't trust his own judgment to the point where he never wants to give an opinion on any painting, but he inherently has a sense of order and simplicity in his aesthetic sense.</t315>
<t316>Marianne was afraid of offending her sister and said nothing more about the matter, but from Elinor's approving attitude towards him when describing, his manner of appreciating other people's paintings still did not reach the level of passionate enjoyment that she believed could be called aesthetic taste.</t316> <t317>Nevertheless, although she inwardly smiled at this misunderstanding, she still respected her sister's blind affection for Edward.</t317>
<t318>Elinor continued:</t318>
<t319>- Marianne, I hope you don't think that he is generally lacking in taste.</t319> <t320>In fact, I believe you don't think so, because your demeanor towards him is entirely friendly; and if that were your opinion, I am sure you could never be polite to him.</t320>
<t321>Marianne didn't know what to say.</t321> <t322>She couldn't hurt her sister's feelings for any reason, yet she couldn't say something she didn't believe.</t322> <t323>Finally, she replied:</t323>
<t324>- Sister Elinor, you should not feel offended if my way of praising him does not match your perception of his qualities.</t324> <t325>I have not had as many opportunities as you to assess his subtle talents; his preferences; but I have the highest regard in the world for his character and perception.</t325> <t326>I think, in every aspect, he is a valuable and amiable person.</t326>
<t327>Elinor smiled:</t327>
<t328>- She is certain that his closest friends could not be offended by such praise.</t328> <t329>She cannot think of how you could have made a more heartfelt remark.</t329>
<t330>Marianne was happy to see her sister so easily pleased.</t330>
<t331>Elinor continued:</t331>
<t332>- I think if you have met him often to have comfortable conversations with him, then no one would doubt his awareness and qualities.</t332> <t333>Just because of shyness, his empathy and excellent manners are hidden and often make him reticent.</t333> <t334>You have understood him quite well, so you need to be fair to his true value, as you said, because due to special circumstances, I do not understand him as well as you do.</t334> <t335>He and you have had many opportunities to be close, while I was immersed in the most compassionate principles of our mother.</t335> <t336>You have interacted with him many times, have understood his thoughts, and have heard his opinions on literary topics and aesthetic tastes.</t336>
<t337>" In general, I believe that he has a rather knowledgeable mind, he really likes books, has a rich imagination, fair and accurate perception, meticulous and urgent aesthetic sense.</t337> <t338>At first glance, his gestures do not make an impression.</t338> <t339>His appearance is hard to say handsome, but if you notice his eyes expressing an unusual sharpness and his gentle demeanor, you will see a complete difference.</t339> <t340>Now, I know him well enough to think that he is truly handsome; or at least, almost so.</t340> <t341>What do you think, Marianne?"</t341>
<t342>- Sister Elinor, soon you will realize that he is handsome if you don't see it now.</t342> <t343>When you tell me to love him as a brother-in-law, then I will no longer see flaws in his appearance as I currently see flaws in his soul.</t343>
<t344>Elinor was surprised to hear her sister speak and felt regretful for having been too passionate when talking about him.</t344> <t345>She believed that Edward held a very high place in her thoughts.</t345> <t346>She trusted that he and she thought of each other, but she needed more concrete signs to convince Marianne about their relationship.</t346> <t347>She knew Marianne's and her mother's temperament: at present, they were still speculating, but soon they would believe—they were like that, wishing to hope, and hoping to wait.</t347> <t348>She tried to explain the true nature of the matter to her sister.</t348> <t349>She said:</t349>
<t350>- You don't want to deny that you think very highly of him... that you respect him, that you like him.</t350>
<t351>At this point, Marianne impatiently exclaimed:</t351>
<t352>- Admire him! Love him! Sister Elinor is truly cold!</t352> <t353>Indeed, shame does not want to show the opposite.</t353> <t354>If you keep talking like that, I will leave this place immediately.</t354>
<t355>Elinor couldn't help but laugh.</t355>
<t356>- I'm sorry, and please believe that I have no intention of offending you when I tell you that my feelings are stronger than what I say, in short, believe that he deserves it.</t356> <t357>As for the suspicion- the hope in his intentions- for me, it can be considered justified, so as not to fall into carelessness or foolishness.</t357>
<t358>"But you shouldn't believe in things that go beyond that.</t358> <t359>I am not at all sure about his feelings for me.</t359> <t360>There are things that seem suspicious at the moment. When his thoughts are unclear, you shouldn't worry about my intention to avoid expressing my feelings; you shouldn't trust beyond the present reality.</t360> <t361>In my mind, I don't feel much—and that's not because I doubt his feelings.</t361>
<t362>"But there are other points to consider beyond matters of the heart.</t362> <t363>He is not capable of being independent.</t363> <t364>We do not know what his mother thinks; but judging by the way Fanny occasionally comments on her attitude and opinions, we should not assume she is a pleasant person.</t364> <t365>You would be greatly mistaken if Edward himself does not realize that there will be many obstacles when he wants to marry a girl without fortune and not of the same class.</t365>
<t366>Marianne was extremely surprised when she realized that her mother and she herself had been deluding themselves too much.</t366> <t367>Her sister said:</t367>
<t368>- I have not made any promises to him! However, this will happen soon.</t368> <t369>But there will be two advantages due to this delay.</t369> <t370>You will not have to be away from me too soon, and Edward will have more opportunities to improve his appreciation skills to match my expectations, which are very necessary for my future happiness.</t370> <t371>Oh, how delightful it would be if he were encouraged by my talent to learn to paint!</t371>
<t372>Elinor told her sister her true opinion.</t372> <t373>She could not indulge her feelings for Edward to the passionate extent that Marianne believed she should.</t373> <t374>Sometimes, she did not see him express clear feelings, which made her think that if it was not indifference, it seemed almost like a lack of promise.</t374> <t375>Even if he was uncertain about her feelings, he should not have become more silent because of it.</t375> <t376>That thought could hardly make him as withdrawn as she often observed.</t376> <t377>Rather, it was probably because he was not independent, so he could not live according to his feelings.</t377> <t378>She knew that at this time, his mother did not make his life comfortable at his home and did not promise to help him establish a home of his own, as she still wanted to impose her will to elevate his status.</t378>
<t379>In such an understanding, Elinor could not feel comfortable.</t379> <t380>She could not rely solely on his feelings for her, which her mother and sister firmly believed in.</t380> <t381>No, the closer they got, the more uncertain she became about his thoughts.</t381> <t382>At times, in moments of sadness, she believed that there was nothing more than friendship.</t382>
<t383>However, even if there truly were any limits, his sister still felt at the end of her tether upon realizing the situation, which made her frustrated, and at the same time (even more frequently) made her become impolite.</t383> <t384>Whenever she had the chance, she confronted her mother-in-law, speaking eloquently about his ambitions, about Mrs. Ferras' intention that both her sons should marry into nobility, and about the lurking danger from any girl trying to seduce him.</t384> <t385>She even accused Mrs. Daswood of being unable to pretend ignorance or maintain a calm demeanor.</t385> <t386>The mother-in-law gave her a response that clearly showed her contempt, then immediately left the room, determined that her beloved Elinor should not have to endure any more of these insinuations for even another week, no matter how difficult or costly it might be to leave.</t386>
<t387>In such a state of mind, Mrs. Daswood received a letter via post, presenting a particularly timely proposal.</t387> <t388>The letter was from a relative of hers, who held a position and considerable property in Devonshire, inviting her to move to a small house with favorable rental conditions.</t388> <t389>This gentleman wrote the letter in a spirit of genuine friendliness.</t389> <t390>He had learned that she was in need of a new residence; and although the house was merely a vacation home, he promised to do everything she needed, if she wished.</t390> <t391>He provided details about Barton Cottage and the garden within his parish, earnestly inviting her and her daughters to come to Barton Park, where he resided, so they could see for themselves how to make the house comfortable enough for them.</t391>
<t392>It seemed that he was eager to receive them, and the letter expressing friendliness made his cousin particularly pleased, especially at a time when she was suffering from the cold and indifferent attitudes of those around her.</t392> <t393>She did not want to waste time thinking or inquiring.</t393> <t394>As soon as she read the letter, her mind was made up.</t394> <t395>If just a few hours earlier, the location of Barton Cottage in the countryside far from Devonshire had made her indifferent, now she accepted it.</t395> <t396>She no longer regretted leaving Devonshire; on the contrary, she desired to go far away.</t396> <t397>This was fortunate compared to the unpleasant situation of being a guest of her daughter-in-law.</t397> <t398>She immediately replied to thank Sir John Middleton for his kindness and accepted his invitation; then hurriedly showed both letters to her daughters, as she wanted them to agree with her decision before she sent the response.</t398>
<t399>Elinor had always thought it was better to be cautious and stable at a distance from Norland, rather than living among the current relationships.</t399> <t400>Therefore, in this direction, she had no reason to oppose her mother's intention to move to Devonshire.</t400> <t401>Moreover, according to Sir John, the house was compact and the rent was low, so she had no grounds to object based on these two criteria.</t401> <t402>Thus, she did not hinder her mother from accepting the offer, although in another direction, it was not the plan she had dreamed of, even though moving completely away from the vicinity of Norland was against her wishes.</t402>
<t403>Chapter 5</t403>
<t404>Immediately after sending the response letter, Mrs. Daswood happily informed her daughter-in-law and her husband that she had found a stable place and would only inconvenience them for a short time while she prepared everything at the new house.</t404> <t405>They listened to her with astonishment.</t405> <t406>Mrs. John Daswood said nothing, but her husband kindly hoped that she would not move too far from Norland.</t406> <t407>With great satisfaction, she informed them that she intended to move to Devonshire.</t407> <t408>As soon as he heard this, Edward immediately turned to look at her, with a tone of surprise and concern that needed no explanation, repeating:</t408>
<t409>N</t409>
<t410>- Devonshire!</t410> <t411>Did she really move there?</t411> <t412>It's so far from here.</t412> <t413>And which area in Devonshire?</t413>
<t414>She informed him of the situation.</t414> <t415>That is a place 4 miles north of Exeter.</t415> <t416>She continued:</t416>
<t417>- It's just a vacation home, but I hope to be able to welcome many friends there.</t417> <t418>It is easy to add 1 or 2 more rooms, and if my friends don't mind the long journey to visit me, I am confident I can accommodate them.</t418>
<t419>She concluded with very polite words, inviting Mr. and Mrs. John Daswood to visit her in Barton; her invitation to Edward was even more earnest.</t419> <t420>Although her final conversation with her daughter-in-law had erased her intention to stay at Norland, she had no regrets.</t420> <t421>She did not want to separate Edward and Elinor, and through her invitation to Edward, she wanted to show Mrs. John Daswood that she completely disregarded her objections to the relationship between the two.</t421>
<t422>Mr. John Dashwood repeatedly expressed to her that he deeply regretted she had chosen a place so far from Norland, making it impossible for him to help her move the furniture.</t422> <t423>He was genuinely troubled by this, as it made it difficult for him to fulfill his promise to his father on his deathbed.</t423> <t424>All the furniture had to be transported by sea.</t424> <t425>These items included bedding, dishes, books, along with Marianne's piano.</t425> <t426>Mrs. John Dashwood sighed as she watched the furniture being taken away: she couldn't shake off the thought that, given Mrs. Dashwood's income would be so much lower than hers, she ought to have been the one to own such luxurious items.</t426>
<t427>The furnishing of the new residence was complete, and Mrs. Daswood could move in immediately.</t427> <t428>There were no issues between the landlord and the tenant.</t428> <t429>She only had to liquidate the furniture at Norland, arrange the new living quarters, and she completed these tasks very quickly.</t429> <t430>A short time after her husband's death, she had sold the horses he left behind, and now, having the opportunity to liquidate the carriage, she also agreed to do so following the earnest advice of her eldest daughter.</t430> <t431>If she had her way, she might have kept the carriage for the convenience of her daughters; but Elinor's opinion was decisive.</t431> <t432>Her prudent calculations also limited the number of servants to three: two maids and a butler who had been with the family since they settled at Norland.</t432>
<t433>The butler and one of the two maids were immediately sent to Devonshire to prepare the house before everyone moved in, as Mrs. Daswood was completely unfamiliar with Lady Middleton and preferred to move straight to the new house rather than stay as a guest at Braton Park for a while.</t433> <t434>She had no doubts about Sir John's description of the house, so she was not curious to inspect it before moving in.</t434> <t435>Her eagerness to leave Norland did not fade with the evident satisfaction of her daughter-in-law upon seeing her about to leave; a satisfaction that could hardly be concealed by the cold words inviting her to stay longer.</t435>
<t436>Now is the time the son can keep his promise to his late father.</t436> <t437>But soon Mrs. Daswood lost all hope in this matter: from his procrastination, she was convinced that his support would not extend beyond allowing them to stay at Norland for six months.</t437> <t438>He often spoke of the increasing household expenses and the endless demands on his finances more than any other man of status in the world, so much so that it seemed he needed more money rather than being able to provide financial assistance.</t438>
<t439>A few weeks after Sir John Middleton's letter arrived at Norland, everything was settled for Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters to begin their journey.</t439>
<t440>Many tears fell during the final parting with the beloved place.</t440> <t441>As she walked around the house alone on the last evening, Marianne lamented:</t441>
<t442>- Oh dear Norland! I wonder when I will stop longing for you?</t442> <t443>Is it when I have accepted a new home elsewhere?</t443> <t444>Oh, happy house, do you know that I am in pain looking at you here, from now on perhaps I will not be able to see you anymore! The trees are still here, but you will continue to live like that.</t444> <t445>No leaf will rot because I have to leave, no branch will die even though I can no longer see you!</t445> <t446>No, all of you will be as before; indifferent to the joys and sorrows you have caused, indifferent to any changes in those who walk under your shade!</t446> <t447>But who is left here to enjoy you?</t447>
<t448>Chapter 6</t448>
<t449>The beginning of the journey was filled with sorrow, so they did not feel tired and uncomfortable.</t449> <t450>But as they neared their destination, they paid attention to the rural scenery, which lifted their spirits, and when they entered Barton Valley, the landscape made them cheerful.</t450> <t451>This is a fertile area, pleasing to the eye, with many trees and lush green meadows.</t451> <t452>After winding for more than a mile, they reached the new house.</t452> <t453>A green courtyard occupied the entire front; a small, elegant gate welcomed them inside.</t453>
<t454>N</t454>
<t455>If considered as a residence, Barton Cottage is a convenient and neat house; but if considered as a vacation home, it has drawbacks due to its common architecture, tiled roof, window shutters not painted green, and the exterior walls lacking climbing vines.</t455> <t456>A narrow corridor runs through the house, leading straight to the backyard garden.</t456> <t457>On each side of the entrance is a very narrow living room, next to which is a study and a staircase.</t457> <t458>There are 4 bedrooms and 2 attics remaining.</t458> <t459>The house was built not many years ago and is still in good condition.</t459> <t460>Compared to Norland, it looks truly poor and small! - but the tears of nostalgia quickly dried as they stepped into the house.</t460> <t461>The servants welcomed them cheerfully; each person, for the sake of the others, intended to create a happy atmosphere.</t461> <t462>It was early September; the most pleasant climate of the year; and as they looked at the scenery in good weather, they felt a beautiful impression that would help them settle in for a long time.</t462>
<t463>The house has a good location.</t463> <t464>Tall hills rise immediately behind it, not far from either side.</t464> <t465>Some hillsides are covered with grass, some are cultivated and have trees.</t465> <t466>The village of Barton lies on one of these hills, creating a pleasant view from the windows of the house.</t466> <t467>The view in front is more expansive, encompassing the valley, stretching out into the distance.</t467> <t468>The hills surrounding the house limit the valley in this direction; under a different name and in another direction, the valley branches into two of the steepest hill regions.</t468>
<t469>Mrs. Daswood was pleased with the structure and interior of the house; for although her previous living situation made it very necessary to have many more things in this place, adding and improving was a pleasure in itself for her.</t469> <t470>At this time, she had enough money to buy everything she wanted to add more elegance to the house.</t470> <t471>She said:</t471>
<t472>-With this house, it is certainly too small for our entire family, but for now, we should arrange ourselves to be comfortable, because it is too late in the year to worry about renovations.</t472> <t473>Perhaps we can wait until spring, if mother has more money, as she is quite sure, we can think about expanding.</t473> <t474>These front rooms are too small to host the family friends as mother wishes.</t474> <t475>Mother intends to connect one part of the two corridors together, using the other part as an entrance; thus, there will be a cozy house with a tea room added to the bedroom and an attic above.</t475> <t476>Mother also wants a more ornate staircase.</t476> <t477>But we cannot demand everything, although mother thinks it is not difficult to extend the space.</t477> <t478>Mother will see what she is capable of in the spring, and then we will plan the renovations accordingly.</t478>
<t479>While waiting for all the renovation works, using the accumulation from the interest of 500 pounds per year of a woman who had never known how to save money in her life, they were wise enough to be content with the house in its original state.</t479> <t480>Each person was busy arranging in their own way, trying to set up the books and everything else to create a home.</t480> <t481>Marianne's piano was opened and placed in the appropriate position; Elinor's paintings were hung in the living room.</t481>
<t482>While they were busy like that, not long after breakfast the next day, they were interrupted by the landlord Boarton, who came to offer some items from his family's residence and vegetable garden that they might still lack.</t482> <t483>Sir John Middleton was pleasant-looking at around 40 years old.</t483> <t484>He had previously visited Stanhill, but it had been quite a while, so the cousins did not recognize him.</t484> <t485>He had a face that looked completely cheerful, and his demeanor was as friendly as the words he wrote in his letter.</t485> <t486>He seemed genuinely pleased that they had accepted to reside there, eagerly concerned about their comfort.</t486> <t487>He spoke of his earnest desire to see them live harmoniously with his family, and he earnestly invited the family to dine at Barton Park every day until they settled into their new place, so earnestly that even though he insisted to the point of exceeding politeness, they still could not feel uncomfortable.</t487> <t488>His kindness was not only expressed in words; for an hour after he left, they received a large basket containing various vegetables from the garden, followed by game meat sent later in the day.</t488> <t489>Moreover, he insisted on helping to receive and send mail for the family through the post office, and could not bear to miss the joy of sending them newspapers every day.</t489>
<t490>Mrs. Middleton had asked him to deliver a very polite note, expressing her desire to entertain Mrs. Daswood as soon as she was sure it would not inconvenience the family; and since the message was answered with an equally polite invitation, Mrs. Middleton was introduced to the family the next day.</t490>
<t491>Of course, the family was eager to meet someone who had greatly influenced their living comfort in Barton, and they all admired her elegant appearance.</t491> <t492>The lady had a delicate face, a tall and striking figure, and refined speech.</t492> <t493>Her demeanor exuded all the elegance that her husband desired.</t493> <t494>However, he could have been better if he were less straightforward and eager; and her visit lasted long enough for them to notice differences from their initial impression, revealing that despite her thorough education, she was reserved, aloof, and could only engage in small talk or make general remarks.</t494>
<t495>However, there was no lack of conversation, as Sir John was very talkative, and Lady Middleton had wisely brought along their eldest child, a boy of about six years old, who became a frequent topic of discussion among the women: they had to ask his name and age, praise him, ask him questions that his mother had to answer for him while he was usually noisy at home.</t495> <t496>In every formal visit, the child had to be the focal point of the gathering, serving as a topic for everyone to comment on and speculate about.</t496> <t497>In this case, it took up to ten minutes to determine whether the child resembled his father or his mother more, and in what specific ways he resembled each; and everyone was surprised by the opinions of the others.</t497>
<t498>The Daswood family would soon have the opportunity to discuss the remaining children, as Sir John would not leave without securing their acceptance to dine with his family the next day.</t498>
<t499>Chapter 7</t499>
<t500>Barton Park is located about half a mile from the cottage.</t500> <t501>Four women had passed by here on the path along the valley, but the view from their residence to there was obstructed by a hill.</t501> <t502>The residence was spacious and magnificent; the Middleton family lived in a setting that was both hospitable and elegant. Hospitality was the character of the husband; elegance was the trait of the Lady.</t502> <t503>They rarely lacked a few friends staying with them in the residence; they entertained a more diverse range of people than any other family in the area.</t503> <t504>This was necessary for both spouses to be happy; for although they had different temperaments and manners, they were very similar in their lack of talent and appreciation, which limited their interactions, regardless of their social class. Sir John enjoyed sports; Lady Middleton had the role of a mother.</t504> <t505>He went hunting; she was content with her children, finding joy only in them.</t505> <t506>Lady Middleton had the advantage of indulging her children year-round, while Sir John had to depend on the appearance of game for half the year.</t506> <t507>However, their entertaining of guests helped compensate for their natural and educational deficiencies, uplifting Sir John's spirits and providing opportunities for his wife to practice living according to her class.</t507>
<t508>B</t508>
<t509>The lady was very meticulous about the way the dining table was set up to entertain guests in a luxurious manner, and about every arrangement in the residential area; her greatest joy in gatherings came from such frivolities.</t509> <t510>But Sir John's satisfaction in social settings was more substantial: he took pleasure in gathering around him more young people than his house could accommodate; the noisier they were, the happier he was.</t510> <t511>He was a blessing for the young people in the area, as in the summer he continuously hosted outdoor feasts with ham and cold chicken, and in the winter his evening gatherings were countless, enough for any young girl to avoid boredom at the age of 15.</t511>
<t512>He always took pleasure when a family had just moved into the area; and in every respect, he was attracted to the residents he had newly welcomed into his cottage at Barton.</t512> <t513>The Dashwood sisters were all young, pretty, and unpretentious.</t513> <t514>That was enough for him to have a good impression, as a pretty young woman only needs to appear unpretentious to become appealing.</t514> <t515>Therefore, when he showed politeness to the young ladies, from his gentle soul he felt genuine satisfaction.</t515> <t516>When helping to settle a family consisting solely of women in his cottage, a gentleman often only respects his own gender, rarely do they wish to elevate their aesthetic sense by admitting women to reside within their estate grounds.</t516>
<t517>Mrs. Daswood and her three daughters were welcomed at the front door by Sir John, who greeted them with genuine warmth as they arrived at Barton Park. As he led them to the family room, he reiterated his previous concern that he could not invite any young gentlemen to introduce to them.</t517> <t518>He mentioned that they would only meet one other noble person besides himself; a special friend who was staying at his estate, but who was neither young nor particularly lively.</t518> <t519>He hoped they would not be bothered by the small gathering, assuring them that this would never happen again.</t519> <t520>That morning, he had visited several families in the hope of inviting more people, but it was the time of the full moon and everyone already had plans.</t520> <t521>Fortunately, Lady Middleton's mother had arrived in Barton at the last minute, and since she was a very cheerful and pleasant woman, he hoped the young ladies would not feel as bored as they might have expected.</t521> <t522>The girls, as well as their mother, were completely satisfied to meet the two strangers and did not wish to meet anyone else.</t522>
<t523>Mrs. Jennings, Lady Middleton's mother, was a cheerful, lively woman, plump, talkative, seemingly happy, and somewhat lacking in tact.</t523> <t524>She had plenty of humorous stories and laughter, and before the meal ended, she had already recounted every witty tale on the topic of lovers and husbands; she hoped they no longer had lingering feelings in Sussex, pretending to see them embarrassed whether they were or not.</t524> <t525>Marianne, annoyed on behalf of her sister, turned to look at Elinor to see how much her sister could endure the mockery, in a manner so earnest that it made Elinor more uncomfortable than Mrs. Jennings' behavior did.</t525>
<t526>Colonel Bradon, a friend of Sir John, seemed unable to adapt to having a temperament similar to his friend, a situation akin to Lady Middleton compared to her husband, or Mrs. Jennings compared to Lady Middleton.</t526> <t527>He had a quiet, solemn demeanor.</t527> <t528>Nevertheless, his appearance was not unpleasant, although in the minds of Marianne and Margaret, he was indeed the archetype of an old bachelor since he was over 35; but even though his face was not handsome, his gestures were full of emotion, and his words were particularly graceful.</t528>
<t529>There was no one at the gathering who could be introduced as a friend of the Daswood family; but Lady Middleton's bland demeanor was particularly off-putting, to the extent that they appreciated Colonel Brandon's sternness and even Sir John's and his mother-in-law's boisterousness.</t529> <t530>Lady Middleton seemed to only brighten up when her four children ran in after the meal, clinging to her, tugging at her clothes, causing all conversation to cease except for talk about the children.</t530>
<t531>In the evening, when everyone learned that Marianne had a talent for music, they invited her to perform.</t531> <t532>They opened the piano, everyone eagerly awaited to be captivated, and Marianne sang beautifully.</t532> <t533>At their request, she performed with Lady Middleton the songs that she had brought to the family after the wedding, and perhaps since that day they had remained untouched on the piano, as Lady Middleton celebrated her wedding by neglecting music, even though, according to her mother, she used to perform wonderfully, which her mother greatly enjoyed.</t533>
<t534>Everyone warmly applauded Marianne's performance.</t534> <t535>After each song, Sir John loudly applauded and equally loudly chatted with others between the songs.</t535> <t536>His wife often reminded him to keep quiet, wondering how people could be so distracted that they paid no attention to the music, and asked Marianne to sing the song she had just finished again.</t536> <t537>Among the group, only Colonel Brandon quietly listened to her.</t537> <t538>He intended to praise her simply by attentively listening to her play without saying a word, so at times she felt fond of him, while others lost her respect for not knowing how to appreciate the art without feeling ashamed.</t538> <t539>His enjoyment of music could be recognized by the contrast with the dreadful indifference of the others, though he did not appear delighted enough for her to feel a connection with him.</t539> <t540>She was sensible enough to accept that a man at the age of 35 had likely passed the stage of passionate feelings and the capacity for joy.</t540> <t541>She was entirely willing to be generous towards the Colonel's age as humanity demanded.</t541>
<t542>Chapter 8</t542>
<t543>Mrs. Jennings was a widow with a large fortune left by her husband.</t543> <t544>She had only two daughters, both of whom were married into respectable families, so now she had nothing to do except to worry about the marriages of the rest of humanity.</t544> <t545>She showed great enthusiasm in pursuing this goal to the best of her ability; she never missed an opportunity to speculate about marriages among the young people she knew.</t545> <t546>She was particularly sharp in recognizing romantic connections, delighting in the advantage of causing confusion and the vanity of many women when hinting at their influence over young men.</t546>
<t547>B</t547>
<t548>She utilized this keen ability after arriving in Barton to firmly declare that Colonel Brandon had fallen in love with Marianne Dashwood on the very first evening everyone met.</t548> <t549>She was very convinced of this by the way he attentively listened to her sing; and when the Middletons accepted the invitation to dine at the cottage, the event was confirmed once more when he again attentively listened to her sing.</t549> <t550>It must be so.</t550> <t551>She was completely convinced of it.</t551> <t552>The two would make a very suitable pair, for he was wealthy and she was beautiful.</t552> <t553>Mrs. Jennings was eager to see Colonel Brandon have a good marriage ever since her relationship with Sir John acquainted her with him.</t553> <t554>She was always eager to find a good husband for every beautiful young lady.</t554>
<t555>Her advantage did not diminish, as she had countless things to tease the two people about.</t555> <t556>At Barton Cottage, she teased the Colonel, and at the summer house, she teased Marianne.</t556> <t557>He was completely indifferent to her mockery if it only concerned him; but for her, at first, it was confusing, and when she understood, she was unsure whether to ridicule the absurdity or criticize the impertinence, as she considered her attitude insensitive to the Colonel's age and the lonely situation of an old bachelor.</t557>
<t558>Mrs. Daswood could not imagine that a man five years younger than her, who looked extremely old-fashioned like him, would fall in love with her young daughter, so she tried to steer Mrs. Jennings away from making jokes about his age.</t558>
<t559>Marianne said:</t559>
<t560>- But, mother, even though you may think this guess is just a harmless annoyance, you cannot deny that it is absurd.</t560> <t561>Colonel Brandon is certainly younger than Mrs. Jennings, but he is old enough to be my father; and if he ever were to become lively enough to fall in love with someone, he has lived past the age for any kind of emotion.</t561> <t562>It's really too ridiculous! Why should a man be mocked in this way, when people should be respectful to him due to his age and physical frailty?</t562>
<t563>Elinor said:</t563>
<t564>- Old? Do you mean to say that Colonel Bradon is old?</t564> <t565>You might easily think that he is just older, not older than mom, but I can't deceive myself into thinking that he can't use his limbs!</t565>
<t566>The mother laughed loudly:</t566>
<t567>- My dear child, if you keep thinking like that, you will always be horrified by your mother's deterioration; and it seems like a miracle to you that your mother has lived to the age of 40.</t567>
<t568>- Mom, you are not being fair to me.</t568> <t569>I know very well that Colonel Brandon is not so old that his friends should fear losing him due to the natural aging process.</t569> <t570>He could live another 20 years.</t570> <t571>But being 35 has nothing to do with marriage.</t571>
<t572>Elinor said:</t572>
<t573>- Perhaps ages 35 and 17 should not be involved in marriage with each other.</t573> <t574>But if the opportunity arises for a single woman at the age of 27, she does not think Colonel Brandon at the age of 35 would refuse to marry her.</t574>
<t575>Marianne hesitated for a moment, then said:</t575>
<t576>- A 27-year-old woman can no longer hope for or inspire love, and if her family situation is not comfortable or her assets are meager, I think she might bring herself to a nursing room, to receive the provision and security of a wife.</t576> <t577>Therefore, it is not suitable for him to marry such a woman.</t577> <t578>It is merely a contract of convenience, and the world will be satisfied.</t578> <t579>In my eyes, that is not marriage; it is nothing at all.</t579> <t580>To me, it is just a commercial exchange, in which each person wants to benefit from the other.</t580>
<t581>Elinor replied;</t581>
<t582>- You know I can't convince you to believe that a 27-year-old woman can feel something akin to love for a 35-year-old man, making him a desirable life partner.</t582> <t583>But I don't agree with your desire to confine Colonel Brandon and his wife to a cramped sickroom just because he happened to complain yesterday (a very damp and cold day) about a slight rheumatic ache in his shoulder.</t583>
<t584>Marianne said:</t584>
<t585>- But he talked about those flannel robes, and to me, a flannel robe is always associated with aches, cramps, rheumatism, and every possible ailment that can happen to the elderly.</t585>
<t586>- If he only had a high fever, I wouldn't despise him half as much.</t586> <t587>Marianne, you should admit that there is something worth your concern in the flushed cheeks, sunken eyes, and rapid pulse of a fever, shouldn't you?</t587>
<t588>- Immediately after that, when Elinor had left the room, Marianne said:</t588>
<t589>- Mom, I'm worried about the illness and I can't hide it from you.</t589> <t590>I think Mr. Edward Ferrars is not well.</t590> <t591>We have been here for nearly half a month, but he still hasn't come to visit.</t591> <t592>There is no reason other than health issues that could cause this delay.</t592> <t593>What else could be keeping him in Norland?</t593>
<t594>Mrs. Daswood replied:</t594>
<t595>- Do you think he will come here so quickly?</t595> <t596>Mother has no such thought.</t596> <t597>On the contrary, if she has any concerns about this matter, it is only recalling that sometimes he did not seem cheerful and willing to accept her invitation when she mentioned his visit to Barton.</t597> <t598>Does Elinor expect him to come?</t598>
<t599>- I have never mentioned this to her, but of course, she hopes for it.</t599>
<t600>- Mom wants to think you were mistaken, because yesterday when she talked to your sister about buying a heater grid for the guest bedroom, she said it wasn't urgent since it might be a while before any guests come to stay.</t600>
<t601>- How strange! What does this mean!</t601> <t602>But it is impossible to explain the attitude of both of them!</t602> <t603>Their final farewell looked so indifferent, so calm!</t603> <t604>They conversed with each other in the evening in such a weary manner!</t604> <t605>The way Edward said goodbye, there was no difference between Elinor and the child: just a few kind words from a loving brother to both.</t605> <t606>Twice I intentionally left them alone together on the last morning, each time he followed me out of the room in a puzzling manner.</t606> <t607>And Elinor, when parting from Norland and Edward, did not cry like I did.</t607> <t608>Even now she always restrains herself.</t608> <t609>Has she ever wanted to avoid everyone, or shown anxiety or dissatisfaction because of them?</t609>
<t610>Chapter 9</t610>
<t611>The Daswood family is now settled at Barton with acceptable amenities.</t611> <t612>The house and garden, along with all the surrounding scenery, have now become familiar to them.</t612> <t613>The daily tasks they pursued, which only gave them half the excitement at Norland, are now continued with greater joy than Norland could provide since their father's passing.</t613> <t614>Sir John Middleton visited them every day for the first two weeks, unable to hide his surprise at seeing them always busy, as he was not accustomed to seeing much activity in his estate.</t614>
<t615>G</t615>
<t616>They did not have many visitors except for those from Barton Park; for although Sir John had encouraged them to socialize more in the area, repeatedly stating that his carriage was always at their disposal, Mrs. Dashwood's independent spirit suppressed her children's desire for social interaction, and she resolutely refused to visit any family that was farther than a walking distance.</t616> <t617>There were only a few families living within such a short distance; not all of them were suitable for socializing.</t617>
<t618>During one walk, the girls found a respectable-looking mansion a mile and a half from their home, along the narrow winding Allenham valley branching off from Barton.</t618> <t619>The mansion reminded them a little of Norland, stimulating their imagination and making them want to learn more about the place.</t619> <t620>But after inquiring, they learned that the owner was an elderly lady of good character, but unable to communicate with the outside world due to her frailty, never stepping out of the house.</t620>
<t621>The entire rural area around them has many beautiful walking paths.</t621> <t622>From every window of the vacation house, the high hills invite them to enjoy the air at the peaks, a happy change compared to the dust from the valleys below that obscures all the beauty above.</t622>
<t623>Marianne and Margaret had a memorable morning walk to one of these hills, drawn by the dim sunlight under the drizzling sky, no longer able to endure being confined indoors as they had been for the past two days.</t623> <t624>The weather was not enticing enough to lure the other two away from their pencils and books, even though Marianne believed that the weather would be beautiful all day and that the threatening clouds would be blown away from the hills.</t624> <t625>Thus, the two girls set off together.</t625>
<t626>Two people happily walked down the hillsides, delighted to catch glimpses of patches of blue sky, and when the southwest wind gusted against their faces, they felt pity for the mother and Elinor, who, out of fear, missed the chance to share such a joyful experience.</t626>
<t627>Marianne said:</t627>
<t628>- Is there any happiness in this world greater than this?</t628> <t629>Margaret, I will walk around this place for two hours.</t629>
<t630>Margaret agreed. The two girls walked against the wind, both battling the wind and laughing heartily for about 20 minutes, when suddenly the sky was filled with clouds, and the rain poured down on their faces.</t630> <t631>Disappointed and surprised, the two had to turn back, as there was no place to take shelter from the rain closer than their home.</t631> <t632>However, they still had the consolation of being able to run quickly down the steep hill leading straight to their garden gate, which was more due to the situation than usual practice.</t632>
<t633>The two people started running.</t633> <t634>At first, Marianne had the advantage, but she slipped and suddenly fell to the ground.</t634> <t635>Margaret couldn't stop to help her sister and had to keep running, reaching the bottom of the hill safely.</t635>
<t636>A young man carrying a gun, along with two pointer dogs circling around him, was walking up the hill a few steps away from Marianne when she fell.</t636> <t637>He put down the gun and ran over.</t637> <t638>She had stood up by herself, but when she fell, she had sprained her ankle, and she could hardly stand steadily.</t638> <t639>The young man showed a desire to help her; and realizing that due to her gentle femininity she felt no need for assistance, he lifted her up with both hands and carried her down the hill.</t639> <t640>He walked through the garden, entered the gate that Margaret had opened, carried her straight into the house, while Margaret also just arrived, not leaving until he placed her sister down on a chair in the hallway.</t640>
<t641>Elinor and her mother stood up in surprise when the two people entered.</t641> <t642>As their eyes fixed on him in bewilderment and discreet admiration, he apologized for the sudden intrusion and explained the reason with such frankness and courtesy that his already unusually handsome appearance became even more attractive thanks to his voice and demeanor.</t642> <t643>Even if he had been old, ugly, and rude, any act of care for her daughter would have been enough to earn her gratitude; in this case, the influence of youth, handsome appearance, and elegant demeanor had sparked the necessary interest for the required action - exactly in line with her sentiments.</t643>
<t644>She repeatedly thanked him, and then, with her usual sweet voice, she invited him to sit down.</t644> <t645>But he declined because he was dirty and soaking wet.</t645> <t646>Then she earnestly asked him to tell her whom she was indebted to.</t646> <t647>He replied that his name was Willoughby, and he currently resided at Allenham. He expressed his wish to return the next day to inquire about Miss Daswood.</t647> <t648>She immediately accepted this honor, and then he took his leave, making everyone pay even more attention to him amidst the pouring rain.</t648>
<t649>His handsome appearance and unusually graceful demeanor immediately became a topic of admiration for everyone.</t649> <t650>His habit of flattering often triggered Marianne's laughter, and her laughter grew even more exuberant because of his attractive appearance.</t650> <t651>Marianne herself did not see him as much as the others did, because her face flushed with embarrassment when he lifted her up, causing her to lose the ability to assess him.</t651> <t652>But she saw enough of him to join everyone in admiring him, through the passionate spirit that always accompanied her praises.</t652> <t653>His person and style were exactly as her imagination had painted for the hero of the story she loved.</t653> <t654>The way he carried her into the house, without any prior formality, demonstrated quick thinking and decisive action.</t654> <t655>Every detail about him was worthy of attention and observation.</t655> <t656>His name sounded pleasant, his residence was in the same countryside they liked, and soon she found that in all types of men's clothing, hunting jackets suited him best.</t656> <t657>Her imagination worked tirelessly, her recollections were all pleasant, and she paid no mind to the pain of her sprained ankle.</t657>
<t658>In the morning, as soon as the weather improved enough to allow Sir John to leave the house, he went to visit them.</t658> <t659>He had heard about Marianne's accident and was now eagerly asking if they knew any dull brother named Willoughby in Allenham.</t659>
<t660>He exclaimed:</t660>
<t661>- Willoughby!</t661> <t662>What? Is he here?</t662> <t663>This is good news; tomorrow I will invite him to dinner on Thursday.</t663>
<t664>Mrs. Daswood said:</t664>
<t665>- So you know him.</t665>
<t666>- Who knows!</t666> <t667>I'm sure I know him.</t667> <t668>He comes down here to play every year.</t668>
<t669>- What kind of person is he?</t669>
<t670>- Believe me, madam, the young man is as good as anyone else.</t670> <t671>A decent marksman, and no one in England rides a horse as boldly as he does.</t671>
<t672>Marianne contemptuously exclaimed:</t672>
<t673>- Is that all you have to say about him?</t673> <t674>What is his demeanor in close interactions like?</t674> <t675>What are his pursuits, what unique talents does he have, and what are his natural abilities?</t675>
<t676>Sir John was a little confused:</t676>
<t677>- Indeed, I don't know much more about him than that.</t677> <t678>But he's a pleasant, cheerful guy, with a black female pointer dog that's the best I've ever seen.</t678> <t679>Did the dog come with him today?</t679>
<t680>But Marianne did not want to talk about the color of his dog's fur to please him, just as he could not express the shades of his emotions to please her.</t680>
<t681>Elinor asked:</t681>
<t682>- But who is he? Where is he from? Does he have a house in Allenham?</t682>
<t683>Regarding this point, Sir John can provide clearer information.</t683> <t684>He informed them that Mr. Willoughby did not have any personal property in the area, but only stayed here when visiting his aunt residing at Allenham Court, who was related to him and would bequeath to him her personal possessions.</t684> <t685>He added:</t685>
<t686>- Yes, yes, Miss Daswood, he is quite the catch.</t686> <t687>He has a small estate of his own in Somersetshire; and if I were you, I wouldn't want to bring my sister to him even if some things went downhill.</t687> <t688>Miss Marianne shouldn't expect to gather all the men for herself.</t688> <t689>Brandon will be jealous if you are not careful.</t689>
<t690>Mrs. Daswood smiled and joked:</t690>
<t691>- I do not believe that this Mr. Willoughby would be upset by one of my daughters trying what you call "catching him."</t691> <t692>They were not brought up that way.</t692> <t693>Men are safe with us; let them remain wealthy forever.</t693> <t694>However, according to what you said, I am pleased to see that he is a respectable young man, and it takes a person of good standing to get acquainted with him.</t694>
<t695>Sir John repeated:</t695>
<t696>- I believe that you are a young man as good as anyone else.</t696> <t697>I remember last Christmas Eve at the intimate dance party at my house, he danced from 8 PM to 4 AM without taking a break.</t697>
<t698>Wide-eyed, Marianne exclaimed:</t698>
<t699>- Do you really dance like that? With elegance, with vitality?</t699>
<t700>- That's right, then at 8 AM you rode off on your horse to go hunting.</t700>
<t701>- This is what I like; a young man should be like this.</t701> <t702>Whatever he pursues, the eagerness in these pursuits should not be at a mundane level, not bringing him a feeling of weariness.</t702>
<t703>Mr. John said:</t703>
<t704>- Yes, yes, I see what will happen, and I will see.</t704> <t705>Now you intend to seduce him without thinking about poor Mr. Brandon.</t705>
<t706>Marianne said in a low voice:</t706>
<t707>That is a way of speaking that I particularly dislike.</t707> <t708>I hate colloquial words meant to be witty; "seduce" or "conquer" are the most disgusting terms.</t708> <t709>It shows a vulgar, base tendency, and if the usage was ever considered refined, then time has stripped away all subtlety.</t709>
<t710>Mr. John did not quite understand the implied rebuke; but he smiled in his most comfortable manner, then replied:</t710>
<t711>- Ah, I am sure you will have many conquests, one way or another.</t711> <t712>Poor Brandon! He has been very sad, and I can tell you, he is worth your charm despite a few slips and sprained ankles.</t712>
<t713>Chapter 10</t713>
<t714>Willoughby - a man of style, the protector of health for both Marianne and Margaret - arrived at the cottage the next morning to inquire about their condition in a personal capacity, with an added elegance in his appearance rather than a precise reason for the visit.</t714> <t715>Mrs. Dashwood received him with more courtesy than the previous day - adding a kind attitude due to Sir John's words about him and also because she herself felt grateful to him.</t715> <t716>Everything that happened during the visit showed him the ability to perceive, style, mutual affection, and the comfort of familial intimacy that the accident had introduced to him.</t716> <t717>He did not need a second visit to recognize their charm.</t717>
<t718>W</t718>
<t719>He noticed that Miss Daswood had smooth skin, a balanced figure, and a fairly beautiful physique; but Marianne was even more beautiful.</t719><t720>Her figure stood out even more, although it was not as balanced as her sister's due to a flaw in height.</t720><t721>Her face was so lovely that even if one falsely praised her as a beauty, there would still be more truth than exaggeration.</t721><t722>Her skin was a bright, crisp brown; her demeanor was all beautiful; her smile was sweet and charming; and from her jet-black eyes shone a vitality, a spirit, an eagerness that anyone who noticed would feel happy.</t722><t723>To Willoughby, the expressions from her eyes were initially somewhat reserved as she shyly recalled how he had rescued her.</t723><t724>But when this passed, when she calmed her spirit - when she realized he combined frankness with the lively manners of a perfectly noble gentleman.</t724><t725>And above all, when she heard him say that he loved music and dancing, she looked at him with approval as if to capture for herself the most important part of his words for the remainder of the visit.</t725>
<t726>Just mentioning any passion is enough to draw her into the conversation.</t726> <t727>She cannot remain silent on such topics, nor is she shy or reserved when discussing them.</t727> <t728>The two quickly realized that they shared a love for dancing and music, stemming from a harmony of judgment in each subject.</t728> <t729>Feeling encouraged to learn more about his viewpoints, she began to question him through the topic of literature.</t729> <t730>With enthusiastic spirit, she mentioned the author she adored; to the extent that any young man at the age of 25 would be insensitive if he did not acknowledge that work as a masterpiece, no matter how much he had criticized it before.</t730> <t731>Their tastes coincided remarkably.</t731> <t732>They both cherished the same book titles and passages.</t732> <t733>If he had differing opinions or objections, they did not last long against her strong arguments and keen eyes. He agreed with all her assertions, embraced all her enthusiasm; and soon they were conversing as if they had known each other for a long time.</t733>
<t734>Right after he left, Elinor said:</t734>
<t735>- Hey, Marianne, I see that in just one morning you have managed to accomplish a lot.</t735> <t736>You have agreed with all of Willoughby's opinions on almost every important topic.</t736> <t737>You know what he thinks about Cowper and Scott; you trust his way of critiquing these verses; you acknowledge that he does not overly praise Pope.</t737> <t738>But how will your relationship last if you resolve every discussion topic so thoroughly?</t738> <t739>Soon you will have no favorite topics left.</t739> <t740>Another meeting will be enough to explain his feelings about poetic beauty, the second about marriages, and then you will have nothing more to ask.</t740>
<t741>Marianne exclaimed:</t741>
<t742>- Sister Elinor, is this proper?</t742> <t743>Is it fair?</t743> <t744>Are my ideas superficial?</t744> <t745>But I understand what you mean.</t745> <t746>I have been too comfortable, too cheerful, too straightforward.</t746> <t747>I have risked mistakes without wanting to be pretentious! I have been open and sincere when I should have been reserved, soulless, bland, and deceitful.</t747> <t748>If I only talked about the weather and the roads, and if I only said one sentence every 10 minutes, then I wouldn't be criticized like this.</t748>
<t749>The mother said:</t749>
<t750>- My dear, you shouldn't feel offended by Elinor - your sister just wants to joke around.</t750> <t751>I can scold her if she wants to control your joy when talking to our new friend.</t751>
<t752>Marianne was immediately soothed.</t752>
<t753>As for Willoughby, he showed every way to express his joy in their interaction and demonstrated his desire for their relationship to become even closer.</t753> <t754>He visited them every day.</t754> <t755>At first, he used the excuse of inquiring about Marianne's health, but he was encouraged by the increasingly polite reception, so the excuse became unnecessary before he could make another, as Marianne had fully recovered.</t755> <t756>She had to confine herself indoors for a few days, but she had never found confinement less tedious than this time.</t756> <t757>Willoughby was a young man of many talents, keen imagination, lively spirit, and generous, affectionate gestures.</t757> <t758>He was indeed the person capable of captivating Marianne's heart; for with such qualities, he combined not only a charming personality but also a natural enthusiasm, now further kindled by her own and more accepted by her feelings than anything else.</t758>
<t759>The friendship with him gradually became her greatest joy.</t759> <t760>They read literature and poetry together, talked, and played music; he had a significant musical talent; he read literature and poetry with all the feeling and soul that Edward unfortunately lacked.</t760>
<t761>In Mrs. Dashwood's judgment, he was as perfect as Marianne.</t761> <t762>Elinor found nothing to criticize in him, except that he wanted to express everything he thought whenever he had the chance, without paying attention to whom he was speaking or in what context—but this habit was very similar to her sister's and particularly pleased her sister.</t762> <t763>He lacked caution in hastily forming and expressing opinions about others, disregarding politeness by demanding absolute attention to whatever was occupying his mind, and easily overlooking social conventions.</t763> <t764>Elinor could not accept this behavior, despite all that he and Marianne wanted to say in his defense.</t764>
<t765>Now Marianne began to realize that the despair which had gripped her at the age of 16—the despair of not being able to meet someone who could satisfy her ideals of perfection—had become hasty and unreasonable.</t765> <t766>Willoughby was everything her imagination had conjured up—during those unhappy moments and in every happier time—about the person capable of making her feel attached.</t766> <t767>His gestures expressed his desire to be that dream person for her, just as fervently as his strong abilities did.</t767>
<t768>Her mother was the same; in her mind, she had no doubt about the marriage between the two.</t768> <t769>Before a week had passed, with the prospect of his wealth, she had hoped for and awaited this marriage; then she secretly congratulated herself on having two sons-in-law like Edward and Willoughby.</t769>
<t770>The feelings Colonel Brandon had for Marianne, which had been discovered early on by his friends, now became clear to Elinor, while the others no longer noticed.</t770> <t771>They turned their attention and wit to his more fortunate rival, and the teasing he was subjected to before his feelings were revealed was now withdrawn as the jokes began to truly resonate with his emotions.</t771> <t772>Although she didn't want to believe it, Elinor had to accept that the sentiments Mrs. Jennings attributed to him merely to satisfy herself were now actually stirred by her sister.</t772> <t773>However, she also saw that although her sister's affections leaned towards Willoughby due to their similar temperaments, the contrasting qualities were not necessarily a hindrance for Colonel Brandon.</t773> <t774>She viewed the situation with concern, for what could a quiet man of 35 expect when competing with a lively young man of 25?</t774> <t775>Since she could not even wish him success, she sincerely hoped he would remain indifferent.</t775> <t776>She liked him—despite his sternness and reserve, she found in him a subject of interest.</t776> <t777>His demeanor was gentle, though serious, and his reserve seemed more a result of self-restraint than natural melancholy.</t777> <t778>Sir John had hinted at past sorrows and despair, which led her to believe that he was an unhappy man, and thus she judged him with respect and sympathy.</t778>
<t779>Perhaps she pitied and esteemed him more because Willoughby and Marianne slighted him, thinking him not lively and youthful, seemingly determined to undervalue his qualities.</t779>
<t780>One day, when they were talking about him together, Willoughby said:</t780>
<t781>- Brandon is just the kind of person everyone can speak well of, but no one cares about; the kind of person everyone likes to meet, but no one remembers having talked about.</t781>
<t782>Marianne exclaimed:</t782>
<t783>- Indeed, I think of him that way.</t783>
<t784>Elinor said:</t784>
<t785>- But don't boast about this, because neither of you are impartial.</t785> <t786>Everyone in Sir John's family respects him, and whenever I meet him, I always want to spend time talking with him.</t786>
<t787>Willoughby replied:</t787>
<t788>- Being sponsored by her is certainly beneficial for him; but being respected by others, this is what is truly reprehensible.</t788> <t789>Who would want to demean themselves to be highly regarded by women like Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings, who are both indifferent?</t789>
<t790>- But perhaps the humiliation from people like you and Marianne helps offset the opinions of Lady Middleton and her mother.</t790> <t791>If their praise is worth criticizing, your criticism might be worth praising; for they are not less discerning between good and bad compared to the prejudice and injustice of you two.</t791>
<t792>- When protecting the person she cares for, she can become rude.</t792>
<t793>- The person I am protecting, as you put it, is someone full of awareness; and awareness always attracts me.</t793> <t794>That's right, Marianne, even for a man between the ages of 30 and 40.</t794> <t795>He has experienced many things in the world; has lived abroad, has read a lot, and has a thoughtful mind.</t795> <t796>You have found in him the ability to provide you with much knowledge in various fields, and he is always willing to answer your questions with an educated demeanor and good nature.</t796>
<t797>Marianne disdainfully exclaimed:</t797>
<t798>- This means, as he told you, that the East Indies have a hot climate and annoying mosquitoes.</t798>
<t799>- She is certain that he would have told her if she had asked; but her questions were about points she already knew beforehand.</t799>
<t800>Willoghby said:</t800>
<t801>- Perhaps what he observed were the colonial officials, the motherland's gold coins, and the sedan chairs.</t801>
<t802>- I can say that his observations are broader than your straightforwardness.</t802> <t803>But why do you have a grudge against him?</t803>
<t804>- I have no ill will.</t804> <t805>On the contrary, I see him as a respectable person, praised by everyone and unnoticed by anyone; a person with more money than he can spend, more time than he knows how to use, and two new cloaks every year.</t805>
<t806>Marianne exclaimed:</t806>
<t807>- Additionally, he lacks innate ability, aesthetic sense, or spirit.</t807> <t808>Furthermore, his empathy does not shine, his emotions are not intense, and his voice does not convey sentiment.</t808>
<t809>Elinor replied:</t809>
<t810>- You speak of his flaws while overly emphasizing your own qualities and abilities, to the point that any praise you might offer him seems indifferent and dull.</t810> <t811>You can only remark that he is a person with feelings, well-educated, knowledgeable, gentle in speech, and, you are sure, has a likable soul.</t811>
<t812>Willoughby exclaimed:</t812>
<t813>- Miss Daswood, now you are treating me without mercy.</t813> <t814>You are trying to soothe me with reason, persuading me against my own intent.</t814> <t815>But it won't work.</t815> <t816>You can see that I am as stubborn as you are skillful.</t816> <t817>I have three inexplicable reasons for my aversion to Colonel Brandon: he warned me about storms when I wanted clear skies, he criticized my speeding in a two-wheeled carriage, and I couldn't persuade him to buy my brown horse.</t817> <t818>However, if you find satisfaction in hearing that I believe his character to be faultless in other respects, then I am willing to admit it.</t818> <t819>And in response to this admission, which I find painful, you cannot deprive me of my right to hold a grudge against him as I have always done.</t819>
<t820>Chapter 11</t820>
<t821>When they first arrived in Devonshire, Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters could not have imagined that there would be so much social interaction occupying their time, or that there would be so many invitations and visitors that they would not have much time left for important tasks.</t821> <t822>But it was indeed the case. Once Marianne had recovered, the plans for indoor and outdoor activities that Sir John had laid out were carried out.</t822> <t823>Thus, intimate dances began; outings on the lakes were conducted regularly whenever the October weather permitted.</t823> <t824>On every occasion, Willoughby was present; and the friendly, informal atmosphere that naturally arose in such gatherings was carefully calculated to bring him closer in his interactions with the Dashwood family, to provide opportunities for him to witness Marianne's exceptional talents, to allow him to express his lively admiration for her, and to receive her affection through her responses to him.</t824>
<t825>K</t825>
<t826>Elonor was not surprised by the relationship between the two; she only hoped that it would not be too blatant, and a few times she advised Marianne to exercise self-restraint.</t826> <t827>But Marianne utterly despised any form of concealment because she saw no shame in being open.</t827> <t828>To her, restraining emotions, which in themselves are not blameworthy, was not only an unnecessary effort but also a shameful dependence on erroneous societal conventions.</t828> <t829>Willoughby had similar ideas, so their behavior always reflected their views.</t829>
<t830>When she was with him, she didn't care about anyone else.</t830> <t831>Everything he did was right; everything he said was wise.</t831> <t832>If there was a card game at the gathering, he would cheat himself and others to give her a good hand.</t832> <t833>If there was a dance, they would dance together for half the night; only separating for a few songs, intentionally standing close to each other, rarely speaking to anyone else.</t833> <t834>Of course, people mocked such behavior, but the mockery didn't shame them and seemed unable to provoke them.</t834>
<t835>Mrs. Daswood involved herself in their emotions with a fervent attitude, so she did not bother to control their excessive expressions.</t835> <t836>To her, this was merely the natural result of feelings in a young and passionate spirit.</t836>
<t837>This is a season of happiness for Marianne.</t837> <t838>Her heart was devoted to Willoughby; and the attachment to Norland that she had carried from Sussex had subsided much more than she had thought, due to the attractions that her interaction with him brought to her new place of residence.</t838>
<t839>Elinor was not as happy as her sister.</t839> <t840>Her heart was not as tranquil, and she did not find satisfaction in the pleasures of others.</t840> <t841>Among them, there was no one close enough to her to compensate for what she had left behind, and no one to help her think of Norland with less regret.</t841> <t842>Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings could not make her forget the previous conversations, even though Mrs. Jennings was talkative and Lady Middleton treated her kindly enough to engage her in most of the conversations.</t842> <t843>She had recounted to her three or four times the history of her life; and if Elinor's memory matched her use of it, from the very beginning of their acquaintance, she would have known every detail of Mr. Jennings's final illness and what he had said to her before he died.</t843>
<t844>Mrs. Middleton was only more agreeable than her mother in that she kept silent more often.</t844> <t845>Without needing much observation, Elinor also knew that Mrs. Middleton's reserve was merely a calm demeanor, unrelated to any depth of perception.</t845> <t846>The way Mrs. Middleton treated her husband and mother was the same as how she treated guests, so there was no need to seek or expect any intimacy.</t846> <t847>Mrs. Middleton often repeated things she had said before.</t847> <t848>She was always dull, for even her spirit was consistently the same.</t848> <t849>Although Mrs. Middleton did not oppose her husband organizing gatherings as long as they were proper and their two eldest children attended, it seemed she never enjoyed them more than staying at home.</t849> <t850>Her presence did not add much to the enjoyment of others, to the extent that only when she showed interest in her troublesome sons did people remember she was there.</t850>
<t851>Among the new acquaintances, Elinor found only Colonel Brandon to be someone she could respect for his abilities, who could spark an interest in friendship, or provide joy as a companion.</t851> <t852>Willoughby, on the other hand, did not.</t852> <t853>Her affection, even her sister's affection, was solely for him; but he was a man in love, focused only on Marianne, and someone much less compatible could still be more charming.</t853> <t854>Unfortunately for Colonel Brandon, he was not encouraged in such a way to think only of Marianne; and while conversing with Elinor, he found solace to compensate for her sister's indifference.</t854>
<t855>Elinor's sympathy for him grew even stronger, as she had reason to guess that he had suffered from unrequited love.</t855> <t856>This speculation arose from a few words he inadvertently let slip one evening at Brandon Park, when the two of them were sitting together while the others were dancing.</t856> <t857>His eyes were fixed on Marianne, and after a few minutes of silence, he spoke with a gentle smile:</t857>
<t858>- As I understand it, your younger sister does not accept someone who has a second romantic relationship.</t858>
<t859>Elinor replied:</t859>
<t860>- That's right, its ideas are all romantic.</t860>
<t861>- Or she believes that there cannot be a second love.</t861>
<t862>- I have the same observation.</t862> <t863>But I don't know how one can have such an opinion without considering the nature of our old man, because he had two wives.</t863> <t864>However, in a few years, its ideas will have a reasonable foundation based on perception and observation.</t864> <t865>At that time, it will be able to identify and justify its ideas more easily than now.</t865>
<t866>He replied:</t866>
<t867>- Perhaps it is so, but the prejudices of a young mind have something charming about them, to the extent that one regrets seeing these prejudices give way to the adoption of more common opinions.</t867>
<t868>Elinor said:</t868>
<t869>-I cannot agree with you on this point.</t869> <t870>There are many disadvantages to having a temperament like Marianne's, which all the charm of enthusiasm and ignorance in the world cannot redeem.</t870> <t871>Her entire disposition unfortunately tends not to know what moderation is; and I would like to see her have a better understanding of the world, considering it the greatest advantage she could have.</t871>
<t872>After a moment of silence, he continued the story:</t872>
<t873>- Did your younger sister have any discrimination regarding the second love, or did she see it as everyone's fault? Can those who were disappointed in their first choice, either because their partner lacked loyalty or due to difficult circumstances, remain indifferent for the rest of their lives?</t873>
<t874>- To be honest, I don't fully understand the intricacies of its principles.</t874> <t875>I only know that I have never heard it accept the possibility of forgiving a second affair.</t875>
<t876>He said:</t876>
<t877>- Such an opinion is not tenable; there must be a change, a complete change of thought.</t877> <t878>No, no, we should not wish for it, because when the romantic essence of a young heart has to depart, what often follows can be ideas that are too ordinary, too dangerous!</t878> <t879>I speak from experience.</t879> <t880>There was a time when I knew a woman with a temperament and mind very similar to your sister's, thinking and judging like your sister, but from a compelled change - from a series of unfortunate circumstances</t880><t881>-</t881>
<t882>At this point, he suddenly stopped, as if he thought he had said too much; his face revealed something that made people guess, if not intruding into Elinor's thoughts.</t882> <t883>Perhaps she would not think about it, if she did not want to mention anything related to that woman.</t883> <t884>However, just a little imagination could link his emotions to a gentle reminiscence of a past relationship.</t884> <t885>Elinor did not want to think further.</t885> <t886>But if she were in her sister's situation, perhaps Marianne would not want to stop here.</t886> <t887>Her younger sister would quickly weave the entire story through her rich imagination; everything would be formed in the most sorrowful context of an unfortunate love affair.</t887>
<t888>Chapter 12</t888>
<t889>When Elinor and Marianne went for a walk together the next morning, the younger sister informed her older sister of news that, despite understanding her sister's lack of caution and thoughtlessness, still surprised her in both respects.</t889> <t890>With great delight, the younger sister said that Willoughby had given her a horse that he had bred himself at his estate in Somersetshire, raised specifically for women to ride.</t890> <t891>Without considering that her mother had no intention of keeping a horse; and if she were to change her mind to accept the gift, she would have to buy another horse for the servant, then hire a servant to ride it, and also build a stable for it - yet the younger sister did not hesitate to accept the gift and eagerly informed her older sister about it.</t891> <t892>She added:</t892>
<t893>K</t893>
<t894>- He intends to send the horseman to Somersetshire immediately, and when it arrives, we will ride horses every day.</t894> <t895>You can share it with me.</t895> <t896>Dear Elinor, imagine the joy of galloping over these hills.</t896>
<t897>She did not want to escape from such a happy dream to fully understand all the painful truths related to the matter, so for a time she did not want to accept it.</t897> <t898>As for having an additional servant, the cost would be trivial; surely her mother would never object, and could buy him any horse; he could get one from Brandon Park; as for the stable, a small shed would suffice. Then Elinor expressed doubts about the propriety of accepting such a gift from a man she knew so little about, or at least had only recently become acquainted with.</t898>
<t899>That is too much for her.</t899> <t900>She said:</t900>
<t901>- Elinor, you are mistaken in thinking that I know very little about Willoughby.</t901> <t902>It is true that I have not known him for long, but I understand him better than I understand anyone else in the world, except for you and mother.</t902> <t903>It is not time or opportunity that determines intimacy: it is only the soul.</t903> <t904>Seven years may not be enough for some people to understand each other; seven days are more than enough for others.</t904> <t905>I should be more reproached for being improper in accepting a horse from him than from Willoughby.</t905> <t906>I know very little about John, even though we have lived together for many years; but with Willoughby, I have long since made my judgment.</t906>
<t907>Elinor thought it best not to mention this matter any further.</t907> <t908>She understood her sister's temperament.</t908> <t909>The more she tried to prevent such romantic affairs, the more her sister would cling to her own viewpoint.</t909> <t910>But Marianne calmed down immediately when her sister appealed to her love for their mother, presenting the inconveniences their indulgent mother would have to bear herself, if (as might be the case here) she agreed to the increased expenses.</t910> <t911>The younger sister promised not to mention the gift to test their imprudent indulgent mother, and would refuse Willoughby when she met him for the first time.</t911>
<t912>Her sister kept her promise; and when Willoughby visited that day, Elinor heard her softly telling him, expressing regret that she had to refuse his gift.</t912> <t913>She also presented the reasons in a way that he could not insist.</t913> <t914>However, he still warmly expressed his concern, then whispered further:</t914>
<t915>- But Marianne, the horse is still yours, even though you can't use it now.</t915> <t916>I will take care of it until you want to receive it.</t916> <t917>When you leave Barton to settle in a permanent place, Queen Mab will welcome you.</t917>
<t918>Miss Daswood had overheard everything.</t918> <t919>Throughout the conversation and in the way the young man intimately called her sister by her first name instead of her surname, she immediately recognized a very affirming closeness, a very straightforward meaning, as if to prove that the two had absolute agreement.</t919> <t920>From this moment, she no longer doubted that the two had made a promise to each other; and this belief created nothing but surprise that she, or any of their friends, with such straightforward temperaments, would only know about the matter by chance.</t920>
<t921>The next day, Margaret told her about an event that helped clarify the situation.</t921> <t922>Willoughby had come to the family the previous evening, and the youngest sister had the opportunity to observe them.</t922> <t923>With the most serious expression, the little girl recounted to her eldest sister when they were alone together.</t923>
<t924>- Sister Elinor, let me tell you a secret about Marianne.</t924> <t925>I am certain that she will marry Mr. Willoughby very soon.</t925>
<t926>Elinor replied:</t926>
<t927>- You have said that almost every day since they met in Highchurch Valley.</t927> <t928>I remember, when they had known each other for less than a week, you decided that Marianne was wearing his picture around her neck, but it turned out to be just a picture of our uncle.</t928>
<t929>- But this is a different matter.</t929> <t930>I'm sure they will get married soon, because he has taken a lock of her hair.</t930>
<t931>- Marianne, be careful.</t931> <t932>It might just be some hair from one of his uncles.</t932>
<t933>- But, Elinor, it really is Marianne's hair.</t933> <t934>I am almost certain, because I saw him cut off a lock.</t934> <t935>After tea last night, when you and mother left the room, the two of them were whispering together, talking rapidly, it seemed like he was begging her for something, then he took the scissors and cut a lock of her hair, because her hair was hanging down her back; then he kissed it, folded it into a piece of paper, and placed it in his pocket book.</t935>
<t936>Elinor could not doubt such details, narrated so coherently: she did not have to think, because the situation completely matched what she herself had heard and seen.</t936>
<t937>Margaret's sharp mind was not always advantageous for her sister.</t937> <t938>One evening at Barton Park, when Mrs. Jennings teased her to reveal what she had long been curious about regarding the young man she particularly liked, Margaret looked at her sister and said:</t938>
<t939>- I shouldn't say it, should I, Elinor?</t939>
<t940>Of course, this remark made everyone burst into laughter, and Elinor forced a smile.</t940> <t941>But this forced smile made her very uncomfortable.</t941> <t942>She believed that Margaret meant to imply that she couldn't remain calm to endure Mrs. Jennings' teasing.</t942>
<t943>Marianne genuinely sympathized with her sister; but she made the situation worse when, her face flushed with anger, she said to Margaret:</t943>
<t944>- Remember that no matter what you speculate, you do not have the right to say it.</t944>
<t945>Margaret replied:</t945>
<t946>- I have never guessed; it was you who told me.</t946>
<t947>This statement made everyone laugh even more, and Margaret felt compelled to say more.</t947>
<t948>Mrs. Jennings said:</t948>
<t949>-Miss Margaret, could you please tell us, what is this man's name?</t949>
<t950>- Madam, I cannot say.</t950> <t951>But I know very well who he is, and I also know where he is.</t951>
<t952>- Yes, yes, we can guess who this man is; surely he resides at Norland.</t952> <t953>I am certain he is the parish pastor.</t953>
<t954>- Kông, not like that.</t954> <t955>He doesn't have any job at all.</t955>
<t956>Marianne spoke very sweetly:</t956>
<t957>- Margaret, you know very well that it's all just your imagination; there is no such person.</t957>
<t958>- Alright, Marianne, so he finally died, because I'm sure there was once a person like that, whose name started with the letter F.</t958>
<t959>At this moment, Elinor felt extremely grateful to Lady Middleton when she remarked "it's raining heavily," though she thought the interruption was not meant to draw less attention to her, but simply because the Lady had an aversion to such inelegant jesting topics while her husband and mother-in-law found them amusing.</t959> <t960>Nevertheless, Colonel Brandon continued the Lady's idea because he always paid attention to others' feelings; and the two mainly talked about the weather.</t960> <t961>Willoughby opened the lid of the piano and asked Marianne to sit down, thus preventing everyone from picking up the old conversation.</t961> <t962>But Elinor could not easily calm herself from the state of panic.</t962>
<t963>That evening, they agreed to go the next day to see a very beautiful area 12 miles from Barton, owned by Colonel Brandon's brother-in-law.</t963> <t964>If it weren't for the Colonel, they wouldn't be able to visit, as the owner was away and had given strict orders to that effect.</t964> <t965>Everyone had heard that the scenery in this area was very beautiful, thanks to Sir John's enthusiastic praise.</t965> <t966>He might have judged correctly, as he had organized at least two trips there each summer in the past.</t966> <t967>There was a picturesque lake, and sailing there would provide enjoyment for almost the entire morning.</t967> <t968>They would bring cold food, use only an open carriage, and everything would be done in a casual manner so that the group could enjoy their outing together.</t968>
<t969>For some people in the group, the trip was somewhat risky at this time of year, and it had rained every day for the past two weeks.</t969> <t970>Elinor advised Mrs. Daswood to stay home because she had a cold.</t970>
<t971>Chapter 13</t971>
<t972>The trip to Withwell had many changes compared to what Elinor initially anticipated.</t972> <t973>She had prepared to be drenched, exhausted, and frightened; but the situation was even more unfortunate, because they didn't go anywhere at all.</t973>
<t974>C</t974>
<t975>At 10 o'clock, the whole group gathered at Barton Park and had breakfast.</t975> <t976>The morning weather was quite good despite the rain all night, the sun often appeared.</t976> <t977>Everyone's spirits were high, excited, eager to have fun, determined to endure any inconvenience and hardship rather than complain.</t977>
<t978>While everyone was having breakfast, the servant brought in the mail.</t978> <t979>There was a letter for Colonel Brandon; he picked it up, read it, changed his expression, and immediately left the room.</t979>
<t980>Mr. John asked:</t980>
<t981>- What happened to Brandon?</t981>
<t982>No one can answer.</t982>
<t983>Mrs. Middleton said:</t983>
<t984>- I hope he doesn't receive bad news.</t984> <t985>There must be something unusual that made Colonel Brandon leave my breakfast table so abruptly.</t985>
<t986>He returned 5 minutes later.</t986>
<t987>When he entered, Mrs. Jennings said:</t987>
<t988>Colonel, I hope it's not bad news.</t988>
<t989>- Madam, there is nothing, thank you.</t989>
<t990>- Is the letter from Avignon?</t990> <t991>I hope the news isn't that your sister's illness has worsened.</t991>
<t992>- Madam, there is no letter from the city, only commercial mail.</t992>
<t993>- But if this is just a business letter, why are you so confused?</t993> <t994>Hey, hey, Colonel, that's not acceptable.</t994> <t995>Tell us the truth.</t995>
<t996>- Dear mother, please keep your word.</t996>
<t997>Mrs. Jennings paid no heed to her daughter's reproach:</t997>
<t998>- Perhaps the letter informs you that your cousin Fanny is getting married, right?</t998>
<t999>- No, actually it's not.</t999>
<t1000>- Well then, Colonel, I know who that is.</t1000> <t1001>And I hope she is still well.</t1001>
<t1002>He blushed:</t1002>
<t1003>-Who do you mean?</t1003>
<t1004>- Ah! You know who I'm talking about.</t1004>
<t1005>He said to Mrs. Middleton:</t1005>
<t1006>- Madam, I regret to inform you that I received this letter today, as it pertains to work that requires my immediate presence in the city.</t1006>
<t1007>Mrs. Jennings exclaimed:</t1007>
<t1008>- In the city! What can you do in the city at this time of year?</t1008>
<t1009>He continued:</t1009>
<t1010>- I am very sorry to have to excuse myself from such a pleasant gathering, because I fear that without me accompanying you, you may not be permitted to enter Whitwell.</t1010>
<t1011>He dealt a blow to everyone!</t1011>
<t1012>Marianne eagerly:</t1012>
<t1013>- But if you write a note for the butler, isn't that enough?</t1013>
<t1014>He shook his head.</t1014>
<t1015>Mr. John said:</t1015>
<t1016>- We have to go.</t1016> <t1017>It can't be postponed once everything is ready.</t1017> <t1018>Brandon, you can only go to the city tomorrow, that's all.</t1018>
<t1019>- I wish I could settle it as easily as that.</t1019> <t1020>But I don't have the right to delay even for a day!</t1020>
<t1021>Mrs. Jennings said:</t1021>
<t1022>- If you tell us what your job is, we will see if it can be postponed or not.</t1022>
<t1023>Willoughby said:</t1023>
<t1024>- Even if he delays his departure until we return, he will be late by no more than six hours.</t1024>
<t1025>- I can't afford to lose an hour.</t1025>
<t1026>At that moment, Elinor heard Willoughby whispering to Marianne:</t1026>
<t1027>- There are people who cannot endure a group having fun together.</t1027> <t1028>Brandon is such a person.</t1028> <t1029>I am sure he is afraid of catching a cold and came up with this trick to escape.</t1029> <t1030>I want to bet 50 gold coins that the letter was written by him.</t1030>
<t1031>Marianne said:</t1031>
<t1032>- I think so too.</t1032>
<t1033>Mr. John replied:</t1033>
<t1034>- Brandon, I know I can't persuade you to change your mind once you've made up your mind.</t1034> <t1035>But I hope you will think it over more carefully.</t1035> <t1036>Just think, there are the two Carey sisters from Newtonddeens, the three Daswood sisters walking from the holiday house, and Willoughby having to wake up 2 hours earlier than usual, all with the purpose of going to Whitwell.</t1036>
<t1037>Once again, Colonel Brandon said he regretted having to disappoint the whole group; but at the same time, he mentioned it was unavoidable.</t1037>
<t1038>- Alright, then, when will you return?</t1038>
<t1039>The lady added:</t1039>
<t1040>-I hope we will meet Mr. Barton as soon as it is convenient for him to leave the city, and we have to postpone the trip to Whitwell until he returns.</t1040>
<t1041>- Thank you very much.</t1041> <t1042>But I'm not sure when I can return, so I don't dare promise to come back.</t1042>
<t1043>Sir John exclaimed:</t1043>
<t1044>- He must return and he will return.</t1044> <t1045>If he doesn't come here by next weekend, I will go look for him.</t1045>
<t1046>She exclaimed:</t1046>
<t1047>- Yes, Sir John, do that, perhaps then you will know what he is up to.</t1047>
<t1048>The servant called Colonel Brandon's horse handler.</t1048>
<t1049>Mr. John added:</t1049>
<t1050>- You didn't ride a horse to the city, did you?</t1050>
<t1051>- No. I only ride a horse to Honiton.</t1051> <t1052>Then I will use a stagecoach.</t1052>
<t1053>- Alright, if you are determined to go, I wish you a safe journey.</t1053> <t1054>But you should reconsider.</t1054>
<t1055>- Please understand the unavoidable circumstances.</t1055>
<t1056>Then he bid farewell to everyone, and added:</t1056>
<t1057>- Miss Daswood, is there any chance I could meet you and your two sisters in the city this winter?</t1057>
<t1058>- I'm afraid there is no chance.</t1058>
<t1059>- Then I must bid you farewell for a longer time than I would like.</t1059>
<t1060>With Marianne, he only bowed his head without saying anything.</t1060>
<t1061>Mrs. Jennings said:</t1061>
<t1062>- Colonel, before you go, tell me why you are leaving.</t1062>
<t1063>He greeted her, then was escorted to the door by Sir John.</t1063>
<t1064>The complaints and reproaches, which everyone had restrained out of politeness, now burst forth; and they repeatedly expressed to each other how frustrating it was to be disappointed like that.</t1064>
<t1065>Mrs. Jennings beamed with joy.</t1065>
<t1066>- However, I guessed what he was up to.</t1066>
<t1067>Almost everyone spoke in unison:</t1067>
<t1068>- Did you guess?</t1068>
<t1069>- Yes, I'm sure that was Ms. Williams.</t1069>
<t1070>Marianne said:</t1070>
<t1071>- Who is Ms. Williams?</t1071>
<t1072>- What! You don't know who Mrs. Williams is?</t1072> <t1073>I am sure you have heard of her.</t1073> <t1074>She is a relative of the Colonel, dear, a very close one.</t1074> <t1075>We don't want to say how close, for fear the young girls might be shocked.</t1075>
<t1076>Then, lowering her voice a bit, she said to Elinor:</t1076>
<t1077>- This girl is his biological daughter.</t1077>
<t1078>- Really!</t1078>
<t1079>- Ah, yes, he looks just like you.</t1079> <t1080>I am certain the Colonel will leave you his entire estate.</t1080>
<t1081>When Sir John returned, he joined everyone in expressing regret over the unfortunate incident; however, he concluded that they must do something to enjoy themselves since they had gathered there anyway.</t1081> <t1082>After a moment of discussion, everyone agreed that although they could not go to Whitwell, they could take a carriage ride around to lift their spirits.</t1082> <t1083>The servants brought the carriages; Willoughby's carriage arrived first, and Marianne had never looked so happy as when she stepped into this carriage.</t1083> <t1084>He drove very fast, and soon the two were out of sight, and only after everyone else had returned did they come back.</t1084> <t1085>Both looked excited after their outing; but they only generally mentioned that they had driven along the roads, while the others went down the hills.</t1085>
<t1086>They agreed on a dance that evening, so everyone would be very happy all day.</t1086> <t1087>A few more of the Careys attended the dinner, and nearly 20 people joyfully sat at the table, which Sir John observed with utmost satisfaction.</t1087> <t1088>Willoughby chose his usual seat between the two Dashwood sisters. Mrs. Jennings sat to the right of Elinor.</t1088> <t1089>They had just sat down for a short while when she leaned behind Marianne and Willoughby, speaking to her but loud enough for both to hear:</t1089>
<t1090>- I have found out despite all your tricks.</t1090> <t1091>I know where you two went this morning.</t1091>
<t1092>Marianne blushed and replied hastily:</t1092>
<t1093>- Where, ma'am?</t1093>
<t1094>Willoughby said:</t1094>
<t1095>- Don't you know, it was us riding on my two-wheeled horse-drawn carriage?</t1095>
<t1096>- Yes, yes, Mr. Hypocrite, I know very well, I am determined to find out where the two people went.</t1096> <t1097>I hope you like your house, Miss Marianne.</t1097> <t1098>It is a very large house, I know, and when I visit you, I hope you have upgraded it, because six years ago when I visited, I found it lacking in many aspects.</t1098>
<t1099>Marianne turned her face away in indescribable shyness.</t1099> <t1100>Mrs. Jennings laughed heartily.</t1100> <t1101>Elinor realized that in her determination to find out where the two had gone, Mrs. Jennings had actually sent her maid to inquire from Willoughby's coachman; in this way, she was informed that they had gone to Allenham and spent a lot of time wandering around the garden and looking through the house.</t1101>
<t1102>Elinor found it hard to believe that this was true, because there was no reason for Willoughby to suggest, or Marianne to agree, to enter the house while Mrs. Smith was there, given that Marianne was not acquainted with her.</t1102>
<t1103>As soon as they left the dining room, Elinor asked her sister about the matter; she was even more surprised to learn that all the details Mrs. Jennings had recounted were true.</t1103> <t1104>Marianne was angry because she saw that her sister had doubts.</t1104>
<t1105>- Elinor, why do you imagine that we didn't go there, or that we didn't go to see the house?</t1105> <t1106>Isn't it true that you also often wished to go there?</t1106>
<t1107>- That's right, Marianne, but you won't go there when Mrs. Smith is home, and you'll go with someone else, not with Mr. Willoughby.</t1107>
<t1108>- But you are the only person with the right to show the house; and since you are riding in a two-horse carriage, it is impossible for anyone else to accompany you.</t1108> <t1109>I have never experienced such an interesting morning in my life.</t1109>
<t1110>Elinor replied:</t1110>
<t1111>- Sister, I'm afraid that an interesting trip is not always a justification for propriety.</t1111>
<t1112>- Sister Elinor, on the contrary, there is no stronger reason than that; because if there was something truly improper in what I did, I would have felt it at the time, as we always know when we are doing wrong, and knowing that, I could not feel pleasure.</t1112>
<t1113>- But, my dear Marianne, it is your actions that have caused you these impertinent remarks. Do you now begin to doubt your own maturity?</t1113>
<t1114>- If Mrs. Jennings' rude remarks are a testament to her lack of maturity, we will always be offended in our lives.</t1114> <t1115>I do not value her criticisms, just as I do not value her compliments.</t1115> <t1116>I do not feel guilty for having done anything wrong by walking in Mrs. Smith's garden or by looking at her house.</t1116> <t1117>One day, it will all belong to Mr. Willoughby, and -</t1117>
<t1118>- Marianne, even if one day it belongs to you, you still cannot justify what you have done.</t1118>
<t1119>The girl blushed at this implication, but she felt visibly pleased.</t1119> <t1120>After about ten minutes of serious contemplation, she cheerfully said to Elinor:</t1120>
<t1121>- Sister Elinor, perhaps I was thoughtless in going to Allenham; but Mr. Willoughby was eager to show me the place; and it is a truly charming house, believe me.</t1121> <t1122>There is a rather pretty living room upstairs, spacious enough for regular use, with modern furnishings that are pleasing to the eye.</t1122> <t1123>The room is situated in a corner, with windows opening on two sides.</t1123> <t1124>From one side you look over a bowling green, at the back of the house, to a beautiful hanging garden; from the other side you see the view of the church and the village, and beyond that, the ranges of hills we often admire.</t1124> <t1125>I did not take much advantage of the view, as the furnishings are quite pitiable, but if renovated - Willoughby says a few hundred pounds would suffice to create one of the most delightful summer rooms in all of England.</t1125>
<t1126>If no one else had interrupted, Elinor could have listened to her sister describe every room in the house with the same excitement.</t1126>
<t1127>Chapter 14</t1127>
<t1128>The sudden interruption of Colonel Brandon's visit to Barton Park and his resolute attitude in keeping the reason for his departure a secret filled Mrs. Jennings' thoughts and curiosity for two or three days.</t1128> <t1129>She had a curious nature, much like everyone else who tends to pay attention to the comings and goings of acquaintances.</t1129> <t1130>She constantly wondered about the reason for this, convinced that it must be due to bad news, imagining all sorts of distressing situations he might be facing, and then firmly believing that he could not possibly overcome them all.</t1130> <t1131>She said:</t1131>
<t1132>V</t1132>
<t1133>- I am sure there is something very mysterious.</t1133> <t1134>I could see it on his face.</t1134> <t1135>Poor thing! I fear that his situation may not be bright.</t1135> <t1136>The estate at Delaford never brings in more than two thousand a year, and his brother left everything in a mess of debts.</t1136> <t1137>I think he was invited because of financial matters, otherwise what else could it be!</t1137> <t1138>I'm not sure if that's correct.</t1138> <t1139>I would sacrifice everything to know the truth.</t1139>
<t1140>"Perhaps it is about Miss Williams, and gradually I am sure of it, because I heard that she was quite ill.</t1140> <t1141>I could bet any amount on Miss Williams.</t1141> <t1142>It is unlikely that he is troubled by his current situation, because he is a very careful person, surely by now he has arranged his affairs properly.</t1142> <t1143>I do not understand what kind of arrangement that is!"</t1143>
<t1144>"Maybe his sister in Avignon got sicker and invited him to come.</t1144> <t1145>He had to leave in a hurry, seemingly because of this.</t1145> <t1146>In my heart, I hope he overcomes all his sorrows and considers marrying a wife."</t1146>
<t1147>Mrs. Jennings wondered like that, spoke like that.</t1147> <t1148>She changed her opinion with each new guess, all of which seemed equally reasonable as they occurred to her.</t1148> <t1149>Although Elinor was genuinely concerned about Colonel Brandon's situation, she could not comply with Mrs. Jennings' desire to make every possible guess about his sudden departure.</t1149> <t1150>Besides thinking it inappropriate to keep questioning or speculating about the matter, her mind was preoccupied with other concerns.</t1150>
<t1151>It was the unusual silence of the young lady and Willoughby about their relationship, which they should have known everyone was paying attention to.</t1151> <t1152>As the two continued to remain silent, each passing day made them seem more peculiar, more contrary to the temperament of both.</t1152> <t1153>Elinor could not understand why they did not openly confirm to her mother and herself what their attitudes towards each other had already shown.</t1153>
<t1154>She could easily recognize that at this moment the two were not yet in a position to proceed with marriage; for although Willoughby was capable of being independent, there was no reason to believe that he was wealthy.</t1154> <t1155>Sir John had estimated his estate to yield an income of about six or seven hundred pounds a year, but this amount was unlikely to match his expenditures, and he often complained of being in need.</t1155> <t1156>But she could not explain why the two were being so unusually discreet when their relationship had never been secretive at all.</t1156> <t1157>Because the situation was completely contrary to their usual views and lifestyle, she sometimes thought that they had not truly confessed their feelings to each other; and this thought was enough to prevent her from questioning Marianne.</t1157>
<t1158>For everyone, Willoughby's behavior most clearly manifested the affection between the two.</t1158> <t1159>For Marianne, it was all the special tenderness that a loving heart could express; for the others in the family, it was the affectionate care of a son-in-law and brother-in-law.</t1159> <t1160>It seemed as if he regarded the cottage as his own home: he visited there more often than at Allenham.</t1160> <t1161>If there was no gathering at Barton Park, his morning outings were almost exclusively to go there; he spent the entire day with Marianne, with his hunting dog at her feet.</t1161>
<t1162>One evening, about a week after Colonel Brandon left, his soul seemed more open to all the feelings connected with the objects around him.</t1162> <t1163>When he heard Mrs. Dashwood mention the intention to upgrade the house in the spring, he passionately opposed any changes to the place that his emotions considered already perfect.</t1163> <t1164>He exclaimed:</t1164>
<t1165>- What! Renovate this beloved place! No, I will never agree to this.</t1165> <t1166>If you respect my feelings, then please don't add a single stone to the wall, don't extend it by even an inch.</t1166>
<t1167>Ms. Daswood said:</t1167>
<t1168>- You shouldn't worry, such a thing won't happen; because my mother will never have enough money to want to try.</t1168>
<t1169>He exclaimed:</t1169>
<t1170>- I am very pleased to know that.</t1170> <t1171>I hope she remains poor, if she uses the money for better purposes.</t1171>
<t1172>She said:</t1172>
<t1173>- Thank you, Willoughby.</t1173> <t1174>But you should rest assured that I will not sacrifice your feelings or those of anyone else I care about to spend on upgrading the whole world.</t1174> <t1175>Believe that when I calculate my finances in the spring, no matter what amount remains unused, I would rather let it go to waste than spend it in a way that would upset you.</t1175> <t1176>But is it true that you love this place so much that you don't see any flaws in it?</t1176>
<t1177>He said:</t1177>
<t1178>- That's true.</t1178> <t1179>To me, this place is perfect.</t1179> <t1180>No, moreover, I see this as the only type of house where people can be happy; and if I had enough money, I would have Combe dismantled and rebuilt exactly like this cottage.</t1180>
<t1181>Elinor added:</t1181>
<t1182>- Along with the dark staircases and the smoky kitchen, I suppose.</t1182>
<t1183>He is still passionate:</t1183>
<t1184>- Yes, along with everything that belongs to it; if for convenience or inconvenience, the fewer changes the better.</t1184> <t1185>At this moment, and only at this moment, under such a roof, I felt as happy at Combe as I had been at Barton.</t1185>
<t1186>Elinor replied:</t1186>
<t1187>- I feel proud that even in inconvenient circumstances requiring better rooms and wider stairs, he sees this place as his perfect home.</t1187>
<t1188>Willoughby said:</t1188>
<t1189>- There are certainly situations that create deeper feelings for me, but this place will forever occupy my mind in a way that no other place can share.</t1189>
<t1190>Mrs. Dashwood looked at Marianne with satisfaction, while her eyes were fixed on Mr. Willoughby with full meaning, as if clearly indicating that she truly understood his feelings.</t1190>
<t1191>He added:</t1191>
<t1192>- During the ten months I stayed in Allenham, how many times did I wish that someone would reside in the Barton cottage! Every time I passed by, I admired its scenery, feeling sad that no one was living there.</t1192> <t1193>The next time I came back, Mrs. Smith informed me that someone had moved in, and I felt pleased and paid attention to this matter. I did not expect this to be the beginning of my happiness.</t1193>
<t1194>Then he lowered his voice:</t1194>
<t1195>- Is that so, Marianne?</t1195>
<t1196>And he raised his voice and continued:</t1196>
<t1197>- And yet, is Mrs. Daswood really planning to destroy this house?</t1197> <t1198>She will lose its simplicity through her upgrades in delusion! This beloved hallway where we first got to know each other, where we have spent many happy hours, she will downgrade to a mere common entrance, and everyone will eagerly pass through the room that has so far provided more genuine comfort than any other room of the most spacious size in the world.</t1198>
<t1199>Once again, Mrs. Dashwood reassured him that she would not make any such repairs.</t1199>
<t1200>He warmly replied:</t1200>
<t1201>- You are truly kind.</t1201> <t1202>Your promise puts me at ease.</t1202> <t1203>Just a little more assurance from you would make me happy.</t1203> <t1204>Please tell me that not only will your house remain unchanged, but I will also always see you and others unchanged; and that you will always treat me with the kindness that has made everything about you so dear to me.</t1204>
<t1205>Mrs. Dashwood was willing to promise, and Willoughby's demeanor throughout the evening showed every sign of warmth and happiness.</t1205>
<t1206>When he took his leave, Mrs. Daswood said:</t1206>
<t1207>- Can we meet you again at dinner tomorrow night?</t1207> <t1208>I am not asking you to come in the morning because we have to visit Lady Middleton.</t1208>
<t1209>He promised to return at four in the afternoon.</t1209>
<t1210>Chapter 15</t1210>
<t1211>Mrs. Dashwood and her two daughters visited Lady Middleton the next day; Marianne excused herself, citing some trivial busywork.</t1211> <t1212>Mrs. Dashwood was entirely content to leave her at home, as she suspected Willoughby had arranged to visit her once the three were away.</t1212>
<t1213>B</t1213>
<t1214>When they returned, they saw Willoughby's two-wheeled carriage and servant at the cottage, and Mrs. Dashwood thought she had guessed correctly.</t1214> <t1215>Until this moment, everything had gone as she had anticipated, but upon entering the house, she realized she had not foreseen everything.</t1215> <t1216>As the three of them entered the hallway, Marianne hurried out with an expression of utmost distress, dabbing her eyes with a handkerchief; and she ran upstairs without noticing them.</t1216> <t1217>Surprised and bewildered, they went straight into the room she had just left, finding Willoughby standing by the fireplace, his back turned to them.</t1217> <t1218>He turned around as they entered, and his expression showed that he had contributed to the turmoil afflicting Marianne.</t1218>
<t1219>Mrs. Daswood exclaimed:</t1219>
<t1220>- What's wrong with the little girl - is she sick?</t1220>
<t1221>Trying to create a cheerful demeanor, he replied:</t1221>
<t1222>- I hope not.</t1222>
<t1223>And through a forced smile, he continued:</t1223>
<t1224>- It is I who might fall ill - because I am deeply disappointed.</t1224>
<t1225>- Disappointed?</t1225>
<t1226>- Yes, because I couldn't keep my appointment with you.</t1226> <t1227>This morning, Mrs. Smith exercised the rights of the wealthy over a poor dependent relative by sending me to take care of some business in London.</t1227> <t1228>I just received the message and have said goodbye to Allenham; now I am here to say goodbye to you.</t1228>
<t1229>- Going to London!</t1229> <t1230>Are you leaving this morning</t1230><t1231>?</t1231>
<t1232>- Almost right now.</t1232>
<t1233>- What a pity.</t1233> <t1234>But we must follow Mrs. Smith's wishes; I hope your work won't require you to be away from us for long.</t1234>
<t1235>He blushed when he answered:</t1235>
<t1236>- You are very kind, but I have no plans to return to Devonshire anytime soon.</t1236> <t1237>My visits to Mrs. Smith never last less than twelve months.</t1237>
<t1238>- But isn't Mrs. Smith the only person you know?</t1238> <t1239>Is Allenham the only house that welcomes you?</t1239> <t1240>Shame on you, Willoughby, do you have to wait for my invitation</t1240><t1241>!</t1241>
<t1242>His face turned even redder.</t1242> <t1243>With his eyes cast down, he could only reply:</t1243>
<t1244>- You are really too kind.</t1244>
<t1245>Mrs. Dashwood looked at Elinor in astonishment.</t1245> <t1246>Elinor was equally stunned.</t1246> <t1247>For a moment, everyone was silent.</t1247> <t1248>Mrs. Dashwood spoke first:</t1248>
<t1249>- Dear Mr. Willoughby, I can only add that Barton Cottage is always ready to welcome you. I will not urge you to return immediately, as only you can determine how pleased Mrs. Smith will be about this.</t1249> <t1250>In this regard, I cannot doubt your arrangements nor question your intentions.</t1250>
<t1251>Willoughby was embarrassed:</t1251>
<t1252>- The matter I'm busy with is so... to the extent that... I'm ashamed -</t1252>
<t1253>He fell silent.</t1253> <t1254>Mrs. Daswood was too surprised to respond.</t1254> <t1255>Another moment of silence.</t1255> <t1256>Then he smiled:</t1256>
<t1257>- It's crazy to prolong this moment.</t1257> <t1258>I don't want to torment myself any longer by clinging to friends who now only bring sadness when we meet.</t1258>
<t1259>He hurriedly bid them farewell and left the room.</t1259> <t1260>They saw him step onto the carriage, and in an instant, he was out of sight.</t1260>
<t1261>Mrs. Dashwood was too emotional to speak, immediately leaving the hallway to be alone with the anxiety and confusion caused by the unexpected farewell.</t1261>
<t1262>Elinor was at least as unsettled as her mother.</t1262> <t1263>She thought about what had happened with anxiety and doubt.</t1263> <t1264>Willoughby's behavior when he bid them farewell, his confused and awkward attempt at cheerfulness, and above all, his reluctance to accept her mother's invitation, were entirely contrary to the actions of a man in love - not at all like him; all of this left her bewildered.</t1264> <t1265>At one moment she thought he had no serious intentions; at another, she believed there had been a quarrel between him and the unfortunate younger sister; Marianne's sorrowful demeanor could most reasonably be explained by a severe argument, though considering Marianne's love for him, a quarrel seemed unlikely.</t1265>
<t1266>But regardless of the circumstances surrounding their separation, Elinor could not doubt that her sister was in deep sorrow.</t1266> <t1267>Through the deepest empathy, she thought about her sister's sensitive nature: expressing intense grief not to find relief, but as if to fulfill a duty to him after their separation.</t1267>
<t1268>About half an hour later, the mother returned, and although her eyes were red, her expression was not less joyful.</t1268>
<t1269>- Elinor, our dear Willoughby has now gone many miles away from Barton.</t1269> <t1270>How heavy must his heart be when he has to leave?</t1270>
<t1271>- Everything is very strange.</t1271> <t1272>Leaving so suddenly like that! It seems like a spur-of-the-moment decision.</t1272> <t1273>Last night, wasn't he still with us, so happy, so joyful, so affectionate?</t1273> <t1274>Now, just ten minutes after announcing it, he leaves without promising to return!</t1274> <t1275>Something has happened beyond what he admitted to us.</t1275> <t1276>He didn't speak or act like his usual self.</t1276> <t1277>Mother must have noticed the difference as I did.</t1277> <t1278>What is this about? Could the two of you have had an argument?</t1278> <t1279>Is there any other reason why he wouldn't want to accept Mother's invitation to come back?</t1279>
<t1280>- Elinor, he didn't want to refuse; mother sees this clearly.</t1280> <t1281>He doesn't have the real authority to accept.</t1281> <t1282>Believe me, mother has thought through everything, mother can clearly explain everything that initially seemed strange to both you and me.</t1282>
<t1283>- Really?</t1283>
<t1284>- That's right.</t1284> <t1285>Mother has rationalized it in the most reasonable way for herself; but you, Elinor, you always doubt everything - you won't be at ease, I know; but you shouldn't advise me not to trust.</t1285> <t1286>I believe that Mrs. Smith suspected he had feelings for Marianne, didn't approve of it (perhaps because she had someone else in mind for him), so for that reason she wanted to send him away, then fabricated some work to get rid of him.</t1286> <t1287>I believe so.</t1287> <t1288>Moreover, he knows she truly opposes the relationship with your sister, so he didn't dare confess that he had proposed to Marianne, and because he couldn't support himself, he thought it best to comply with her, follow her wishes, and leave Devonshire for a while.</t1288> <t1289>I know you'll say it could be true or not; but I don't want to hear you argue stubbornly, unless you have another reasonable explanation for this matter.</t1289> <t1290>Elinor, what do you want to say now?</t1290>
<t1291>- I don't want to say anything, because you have already anticipated my answer.</t1291>
<t1292>- Then you should have said that this matter could or could not happen.</t1292> <t1293>Oh, Elinor, how difficult it is to understand your thoughts! You would rather think of the bad than the good.</t1293> <t1294>You would rather seek suffering for Marianne and blame poor Willoughby than forgive him.</t1294> <t1295>You are determined that he deserves condemnation because he parted from us with less affection than his usual demeanor showed.</t1295> <t1296>But do you not think it was due to his carelessness, or due to a decline in spirits because of recent disappointments?</t1296> <t1297>Can you not accept any possibility, just because you are not certain?</t1297> <t1298>Is there nothing worthy of someone whom we all have reason to love, and no reason to think ill of?</t1298> <t1299>Or with assumptions of motives that cannot be answered, even though they are unavoidable secrets for a time?</t1299> <t1300>In the end, what do you suspect him of?</t1300>
<t1301>- It's hard for me to say.</t1301> <t1302>But suspecting some discomfort is the inevitable consequence of such a change as we see in him.</t1302> <t1303>However, mother is very right in persuading us to sympathize with him, and I really want to be straightforward when judging everyone.</t1303> <t1304>We must admit that Willoughby may have very legitimate reasons for showing such an attitude; I hope so.</t1304> <t1305>But someone like Willoughby should have expressed these reasons immediately.</t1305> <t1306>It may require secrecy, but I can't help but wonder why he is like that.</t1306>
<t1307>- Don't blame him when he doesn't act according to his nature, when he needs to change.</t1307> <t1308>But do you honestly think I'm being fair when I defend him?</t1308> <t1309>I am very pleased - and he is forgiven.</t1309>
<t1310>- Not entirely like that.</t1310> <t1311>It may be appropriate to conceal the feelings between the two (if they truly have affection for each other) from Mrs. Smith; and if that's the case, it would benefit him to cover it up a bit in Devonshire.</t1311> <t1312>But there is no reason to hide it from us.</t1312>
<t1313>- Concealing from us! My dear, do you mean to accuse Willoughby and Marianne of concealing?</t1313> <t1314>How strange, since you have been reproaching them every day for being imprudent.</t1314>
<t1315>Elinor said:</t1315>
<t1316>- I don't need evidence of their feelings for each other, but I do need evidence that they have made a promise to each other.</t1316>
<t1317>- Mom is completely satisfied on both points.</t1317>
<t1318>- However, no one said a word to mother about their affair.</t1318>
<t1319>- Mother doesn't need to hear words when actions have spoken so clearly.</t1319> <t1320>Hasn't his attitude towards Marianne and all of us, at least for the past half month, shown that he loves and sees your sister as his future wife, that he feels we are the closest family, right?</t1320> <t1321>Haven't we understood each other very well already?</t1321> <t1322>Haven't his looks, his gestures, his respectful attitude in caring and affection, all implied that he is asking for your approval?</t1322> <t1323>My Elinor, do you doubt the engagement between the two of them?</t1323> <t1324>How could you have such a thought? How could you think that Willoughby could leave your sister, perhaps for many months, without confessing his love to her, when he was sure she loved him; and why do you think they parted without an engagement?</t1324>
<t1325>Elinor replied:</t1325>
<t1326>- I acknowledge that except for one thing, all situations indicate that they had an agreement, and this thing is that both are completely silent about the matter.</t1326> <t1327>For me, this outweighs the other situations.</t1327>
<t1328>- How strange! I would really think poorly of Willoughby if you still doubted the nature of their relationship after everything has come to light.</t1328> <t1329>Was part of his behavior all this time just an act towards your sister?</t1329> <t1330>Do you think he was completely indifferent to her?</t1330>
<t1331>- No, you can't think like that.</t1331> <t1332>I am sure he loves my sister.</t1332>
<t1333>- But to love in that strange way, in the way you attribute to him, when he can leave you so indifferently, so heartlessly about the future.</t1333>
<t1334>- Dear mother, please remember that I have never been certain about this matter.</t1334> <t1335>I acknowledge that I have had doubts; but these doubts are weaker than before, and they may soon disappear.</t1335> <t1336>If we see the two of them corresponding with each other, all my concerns will vanish.</t1336>
<t1337>- The confession is truly significant! If you saw the two of them standing before the altar, you would guess that they were about to get married.</t1337> <t1338>The narrow-minded girl!</t1338> <t1339>But I don't need such evidence.</t1339> <t1340>There is no thought in my mind to justify suspicion; no secrets kept; everything is revealed and straightforward.</t1340> <t1341>You cannot doubt your sister's wishes.</t1341> <t1342>Therefore, it is Willoughby whom you suspect.</t1342> <t1343>But why?</t1343> <t1344>Is he not a man of honor and sentiment?</t1344> <t1345>Has he ever shown any inconsistency that should worry us?</t1345> <t1346>Could he possibly be a deceitful person?</t1346>
<t1347>Elinor exclaimed:</t1347>
<t1348>- It's not that I hope so, it's not that I believe so.</t1348> <t1349>I like Willoughby, I truly like him.</t1349> <t1350>When doubting his character, I am as pained as you are.</t1350> <t1351>Of my own accord, I doubt, I do not want to encourage doubt. To be honest, I am very surprised by his change in attitude this morning: he did not speak in his usual manner, nor did he respond to your kindness with any friendly gestures.</t1351> <t1352>But all of this can be explained by his circumstances, as you said.</t1352> <t1353>He had just bid farewell to my sister, seeing her leave him in the greatest sorrow.</t1353> <t1354>If, out of fear of offending Mrs. Smith, he did not dare to return soon, yet understanding that by refusing your invitation by saying he would be away for a while, he might think our family would see him as narrow-minded and suspicious, then he should have felt embarrassed and awkward.</t1354> <t1355>In such a case, if he had confessed his difficulties clearly and frankly, it would have been in line with his honor, as well as consistent with his character.</t1355> <t1356>But I will not judge anyone's character on such a strict basis, even if it differs from my judgment or from what I think is right and consistent.</t1356>
<t1357>- You speak very appropriately.</t1357> <t1358>Surely Willoughby does not deserve to be suspected.</t1358> <t1359>Although we have not known him for long, he is not a stranger here; and has anyone ever spoken ill of him?</t1359> <t1360>If he were in a position to act according to his wishes and proceed with the marriage immediately, it would indeed be strange for him to leave us without revealing anything to mother; but that is not the case here.</t1360> <t1361>In some respects, this engagement has not started favorably, as their marriage cannot be certain right away; and in mother's opinion, even keeping it discreet is the right thing to do.</t1361>
<t1362>The two were interrupted because Marianne entered.</t1362> <t1363>Elinor had the opportunity to think about what her mother had said, to consider some things as possible, and to hope that all were true.</t1363>
<t1364>They only saw Marianne at dinner time, when she entered the room and sat at the table without saying a word.</t1364> <t1365>Her eyes were swollen and red; it seemed that even at this moment she had to struggle to hold back her tears.</t1365> <t1366>She avoided everyone's gaze, unable to eat or converse; and after a few moments when her mother took her hand in affectionate sympathy, her fragile endurance reached its limit - she burst into tears and left the dining room.</t1366>
<t1367>Her spirits plummeted disastrously throughout the evening.</t1367> <t1368>She had no strength left, as she did not care to restrain herself.</t1368> <t1369>Just mentioning anything related to Willoughby was enough to make her suffer.</t1369> <t1370>Although the whole family earnestly tended to her in hopes of making her comfortable, they could do nothing to help her avoid all thoughts of him.</t1370>
<t1371>Chapter 16</t1371>
<t1372>Marianne surely thought that it would be indefensible if she slept well on the first night after Willoughby’s departure.</t1372> <t1373>She might feel embarrassed to look everyone in the eye the next morning if she woke up in a pleasant state, not needing any more rest.</t1373> <t1374>She thought it would be shameful if she remained calm, but she did not have to suffer from this thought, because she could not stay calm: she was restless all night, crying a lot during the night.</t1374> <t1375>She woke up with a headache, unable to converse, not wanting to eat anything; every moment caused pain to her mother and sisters, and she did not allow anyone to comfort her.</t1375> <t1376>Her feelings were indeed quite persistent!</t1376>
<t1377>M</t1377>
<t1378>After finishing breakfast, she walked out alone, wandering around the village of Allenham, immersed in the happy memories of the past, crying over her misfortune throughout the morning.</t1378>
<t1379>The evening passed by, letting itself be carried away by emotions.</t1379> <t1380>She played every piece of music she had ever played for Willoughby, every melody they used to sing together, staring intently at each line of music he had written for her, until her heart became so heavy that it could not bear any more sorrow.</t1380> <t1381>Every day she nurtured such sorrow.</t1381> <t1382>She sat in front of the piano for hours, alternating between singing and crying, her voice often choked with tears.</t1382> <t1383>Just as when playing music, she suffered from the difference between the past and the present while reading books.</t1383> <t1384>She only sought to read what they used to read together.</t1384>
<t1385>Such intense suffering cannot last long; within a few days it sinks into a more gentle melancholy.</t1385> <t1386>But the daily tasks, the solitary walks in silent contemplation occasionally release a sorrow that remains as poignant as on the first day.</t1386>
<t1387>No letter came from Willoughby, and it seemed Marianne did not expect any.</t1387> <t1388>Her mother was surprised, and Elinor became uneasy again.</t1388> <t1389>But whenever she wanted, Mrs. Dashwood found an explanation that could satisfy her.</t1389> <t1390>She said:</t1390>
<t1391>- Elinor, remember how many times Sir John has helped us by receiving our letters at the post office and sending our letters.</t1391> <t1392>We agreed that we need to be discreet, and we must acknowledge that it cannot remain discreet if the correspondence between the two of us goes through Sir John.</t1392>
<t1393>Elinor could not deny the truth in this explanation, awkwardly considering it a legitimate reason for the loss of contact between the two.</t1393> <t1394>But there was a very straightforward, very simple, and in her opinion, very appropriate way to know the true state of affairs and to dispel all mysteries, so she had to suggest to her mother:</t1394>
<t1395>- Why doesn't mother ask Marianne right away if she has an engagement with Willoughby!</t1395> <t1396>A question like that from her mother, her really kind, really indulgent mother, could not be offensive.</t1396> <t1397>This is the inevitable result of the mother's love for her.</t1397> <t1398>She has always been straightforward, especially with her mother.</t1398>
<t1399>- Mom could never ask this question.</t1399> <t1400>Suppose the two of them had not made any promises, asking such a question would cause so much pain! Anyway, it is too narrow-minded.</t1400> <t1401>Mom no longer deserves its trust, after having pressured it to confess something it currently does not want to tell anyone.</t1401> <t1402>Mom knows Marianne's temperament well: mom knows she loves mom very much, and mom also knows mom will not be the last person she wants to confide in when the circumstances are right.</t1402> <t1403>Mom does not want to force anyone to reveal personal matters; especially not a child; because the sense of duty will make it impossible for her to refuse, going against her own will.</t1403>
<t1404>Elinor thought her mother's generosity was stretched too far considering her sister's youthful age.</t1404> <t1405>She wanted to push further, but it was useless: common sense, common concern, common caution, all were drowned in Mrs. Dashwood's delicate romantic manner.</t1405>
<t1406>Many days had to pass before the family mentioned Willoughby's name in front of Marianne.</t1406> <t1407>In fact, Sir John and Mrs. Jennings were not so tactful: their mockery added pain to many painful moments.</t1407> <t1408>But one evening, Mrs. Dashwood happened to pick up a work by Shakespeare and exclaimed:</t1408>
<t1409>- Marianne, we haven't finished reading Hamlet; our dear Willoughby left before we could finish it.</t1409> <t1410>We can wait until he returns...</t1410> <t1411>But it might take many months for that to happen.</t1411>
<t1412>Marianne exclaimed, utterly astonished:</t1412>
<t1413>- Many months! No - not even many weeks.</t1413>
<t1414>Mrs. Dashwood regretted having spoken; but Elinor was pleased, because her mother had caused her sister to respond with confidence in Mr. Willoughby and showed that she was aware of his intentions.</t1414>
<t1415>One morning, a week after he left, Marianne was persuaded to take a walk with her sister and younger sister, instead of wandering alone.</t1415> <t1416>Until now, she had carefully avoided going with anyone else.</t1416> <t1417>If her sisters intended to go up the hill, she would go in the opposite direction towards the roads; if they talked about the valley, she would quickly climb up the hilltops and the other two would never find her when they set out.</t1417> <t1418>But finally, Elinor strongly opposed such prolonged self-isolation, so the younger sister listened to her sister's persuasion.</t1418> <t1419>They walked along the road running through the valley, speaking little, because Marianne's mind was not at ease, and her sister did not want to press after achieving the initial goal.</t1419> <t1420>Passing the entrance to the valley where the scenery was not very wild and more open though still with many trees, in front of the three was a long road leading to Barton.</t1420> <t1421>They stopped at a point they had never reached in previous walks, looking around, admiring the entire scene they could see from the cottage.</t1421>
<t1422>Among the targets that the three observers were watching, they soon noticed a moving target: a man on horseback galloping towards them.</t1422> <t1423>Within a few minutes, they could distinguish that it was a nobleman, and in the next moment Marianne exclaimed:</t1423>
<t1424>- That is him, truly; I know it is indeed so.</t1424>
<t1425>And she ran to meet him, while Elinor exclaimed:</t1425>
<t1426>- Marianne, actually I think you are mistaken.</t1426> <t1427>It's not Willoughby.</t1427> <t1428>This person is not as tall as him, the figure is different.</t1428>
<t1429>- The same, the same.</t1429> <t1430>I am sure it's him! - the figure, the cloak, the horse.</t1430> <t1431>I knew you would come back soon.</t1431>
<t1432>She spoke excitedly while walking briskly, and Elinor hurried to shield her sister because she was almost certain the other person was not Willoughby.</t1432> <t1433>Soon, the two were several dozen steps away from the other person.</t1433> <t1434>Marianne looked closely again; her heart sank.</t1434> <t1435>She quickly turned away, walked back swiftly, then her sister's voice called her back.</t1435> <t1436>A third call, almost as familiar as Willoughby's, echoed, urging her to stop.</t1436> <t1437>She turned back, surprised, and greeted Edward Ferras.</t1437>
<t1438>He jumped down, handed the horse to the servant, and walked with the two people to Barton, where he was going to visit them.</t1438>
<t1439>Everyone greeted him with utmost cordiality, but especially Marianne, who showed more warmth towards him than Elinor did.</t1439> <t1440>To Marianne, the meeting between Edward and her sister was merely a continuation of the inexplicably cold relationship she had observed between them at Norland. More notably, as for Edward, his looks and words on such an occasion did not seem like those of a man in love.</t1440> <t1441>He appeared confused, seemed less delighted to see them again, showed no enthusiasm or joy, spoke sparingly when obliged to respond, and revealed no particular affection towards Elinor.</t1441> <t1442>The more Marianne observed and listened, the more surprised she became.</t1442> <t1443>She began to almost dislike Edward; and like other events, this reminded her of Willoughby, whose demeanor was entirely different from that of her future brother-in-law.</t1443>
<t1444>After the next moment of silence following the initial surprise and greetings, Marianne asked Edward if he had come straight from London.</t1444> <t1445>No, he had been in Devonshire for half a month.</t1445> <t1446>She repeated, "Half a month!", surprised that he had been near Elinor without visiting sooner.</t1446>
<t1447>He seemed very distressed when he added that he had stayed with some friends near Plymouth.</t1447>
<t1448>Elinor asked:</t1448>
<t1449>- Have you been to Sussex recently?</t1449>
<t1450>- I went to Norland about a month ago.</t1450>
<t1451>Marianne exclaimed:</t1451>
<t1452>- And how does dear Norland look now?</t1452>
<t1453>Elinor said:</t1453>
<t1454>- Norland is very dear this season, perhaps looking like every previous year - forests and paths covered with fallen leaves.</t1454>
<t1455>Marianne exclaimed:</t1455>
<t1456>- Oh, I used to watch the yellow leaves fall and feel something indescribable! How delightful it was to take a walk and watch the yellow leaves swirl around me with the wind!</t1456> <t1457>How the few leaves stirred up emotions along with the season and the weather!</t1457> <t1458>Now, no one watches them anymore.</t1458> <t1459>People just see the yellow leaves as a nuisance, hastily sweeping them away, taking them as far away from sight as possible.</t1459>
<t1460>Elinor said:</t1460>
<t1461>- Not everyone is as enamored with the golden leaves as you are.</t1461>
<t1462>- No. My thoughts and feelings are rarely shared, rarely understood.</t1462> <t1463>But there are moments.</t1463>
<t1464>As she spoke, she drifted into a reverie for a moment, then snapped out of it, calling him back to reality:</t1464>
<t1465>- Edward, this is the Barton Valley.</t1465> <t1466>Look, try to keep your mind at peace.</t1466> <t1467>Look at these hills.</t1467> <t1468>Have you ever seen anywhere as beautiful as this?</t1468> <t1469>To the left is Barton Park, nestled among those woods and plantations.</t1469> <t1470>You can see the back of the house.</t1470> <t1471>And over there, beneath the farthest hill, standing grandly, is our family home.</t1471>
<t1472>He replied:</t1472>
<t1473>- This area is really beautiful, but the low-lying regions must get quite muddy in the winter.</t1473>
<t1474>- How could you think of mud with the scenery in front of you like this?</t1474>
<t1475>He smiled:</t1475>
<t1476>- Because among the scenes before my eyes, I see a dusty road.</t1476>
<t1477>Marianne replied, as she continued to walk steadily:</t1477>
<t1478>- Strange!</t1478>
<t1479>- Do you have pleasant neighbors?</t1479> <t1480>Are the people in the Middleton family cheerful?</t1480>
<t1481>- No, not all of them, we haven't seen anywhere as bad as here.</t1481>
<t1482>The older sister said:</t1482>
<t1483>- Marianne, how could you say such a thing?</t1483> <t1484>How could you be so unfair? Mr. Ferras, this is a respected family, and they have treated us in the friendliest manner.</t1484> <t1485>Marianne, have you forgotten how many joyful days we have had thanks to them?</t1485>
<t1486>Marianne said softly:</t1486>
<t1487>- I do not forget, just as I do not forget the many moments of suffering.</t1487>
<t1488>Elinor ignored this remark.</t1488> <t1489>She directed her attention to their guest, awkwardly engaging in some activity while conversing with him, talking about her family's current residence, its conveniences..., encouraging him to ask questions or give comments.</t1489> <t1490>His indifferent and reserved attitude made her feel deeply humiliated; she was both displeased and somewhat angry, but determined to show him a conciliatory approach based more on the past than the present.</t1490> <t1491>She avoided showing any anger or irritation, treating him in the manner she thought appropriate for someone related to the family.</t1491>
<t1492>Chapter 17</t1492>
<t1493>Mrs. Dashwood was only momentarily surprised when she first met him; for in her mind, his visit was entirely natural.</t1493> <t1494>Her joy and affection for him surpassed all surprise.</t1494> <t1495>He was received by her in the most sincere manner; and shyness, coldness, and hesitation could not persist through such a welcome.</t1495> <t1496>Before he entered the house, he bore all these traits, but Mrs. Dashwood's demeanor erased them all.</t1496> <t1497>Indeed, a young man cannot love a daughter without showing some affection to her mother.</t1497> <t1498>Elinor was pleased to see that he quickly returned to his usual self.</t1498> <t1499>His feelings seemed to revive for everyone, and he again showed concern for their well-being.</t1499> <t1500>However, his spirits were not uplifted; he praised their house, admired the scenery, he appeared attentive and amiable, but still not enthusiastic.</t1500> <t1501>The whole family noticed this, and Mrs. Dashwood attributed it to his mother's lack of generosity, thus she sat down at the dinner table in contempt of all selfish parents.</t1501>
<t1502>B</t1502>
<t1503>When dinner was over and everyone was sitting around the fireplace, she asked:</t1503>
<t1504>- Edward, how does Mrs. Ferras think of you now?</t1504> <t1505>Are you still a great orator even though you don't want to be?</t1505>
<t1506>- No. I think my mother has to accept now that I don't have any special talent to become a public figure!</t1506>
<t1507>- But how do you build your reputation?</t1507> <t1508>To become famous, you have to please your entire family, and if you are unwilling to spend money, do not like meeting strangers, do not practice a profession, and have no guarantees for your livelihood, you can see that the whole issue is difficult.</t1508>
<t1509>- I don't want to try.</t1509> <t1510>I don't expect to become outstanding, and have every reason to hope never to.</t1510> <t1511>Thank God! I cannot be forced to become a genius and eloquent.</t1511>
<t1512>- I know well that you have no ambition.</t1512> <t1513>All your aspirations are moderate.</t1513>
<t1514>- Just like most people, I think so. Like anyone else, I want to be completely happy; and like anyone else, it has to be on my terms.</t1514> <t1515>Becoming great will not bring me this happiness.</t1515>
<t1516>Marianne exclaimed:</t1516>
<t1517>- The strange thing is that it can!</t1517> <t1518>What does being wealthy or famous have to do with happiness?</t1518>
<t1519>Elinor said:</t1519>
<t1520>- Not famous, but wealth is very much related.</t1520>
<t1521>Marianne said:</t1521>
<t1522>- Sister Elinor, how shameful! Money only brings happiness when there is nothing else to create happiness.</t1522> <t1523>Besides talent, money does not create true satisfaction if it is just the self.</t1523>
<t1524>Elinor smiled:</t1524>
<t1525>- Perhaps we are coming to the same viewpoint.</t1525> <t1526>Your talent and my wealth are very similar.</t1526> <t1527>If we lack both, as the world shows, we will be deprived of all external comforts.</t1527> <t1528>It's just that my ideas are nobler than yours.</t1528> <t1529>So, what is your talent?</t1529>
<t1530>- About one thousand eight hundred or two thousand each year, no higher than that.</t1530>
<t1531>Elinor laughed.</t1531>
<t1532>- Two thousand a year! That is your wealth! You have guessed how quickly this will be exhausted.</t1532>
<t1533>Marianne said:</t1533>
<t1534>- However, two thousand a year is a very modest income.</t1534> <t1535>A family cannot live comfortably with less than that.</t1535> <t1536>I believe that I am not asking for too much.</t1536> <t1537>A few servants, a carriage, maybe two, and some hunters; one cannot live with less.</t1537>
<t1538>Edward repeated:</t1538>
<t1539>- The hunter! But why does she need a hunter?</t1539> <t1540>No one is hunting.</t1540>
<t1541>Marianne's face turned red:</t1541>
<t1542>- But most people go hunting.</t1542>
<t1543>Marianne suddenly had a new idea:</t1543>
<t1544>- I want someone to give each of us a large fortune.</t1544>
<t1545>Elinor exclaimed:</t1545>
<t1546>- Oh, my dear! How happy I will be!</t1546> <t1547>I wonder what I will do with this fortune!</t1547>
<t1548>Marianne appeared as if she did not doubt this matter.</t1548>
<t1549>Mrs. Daswood said:</t1549>
<t1550>- I would be confused about spending a large fortune if my children were all wealthy and did not need my assistance.</t1550>
<t1551>Elinor remarked:</t1551>
<t1552>- Mom should start upgrading this house, then her difficulties will soon pass.</t1552>
<t1553>Edward said:</t1553>
<t1554>- With such matters, the orders from this family sent to London will be absolutely wonderful!</t1554> <t1555>This will be a happy day for the bookstore, the music shop, the printing house. Miss Daswood, you will give generous commissions for every work sent to you; and as for Marianne, I know her grand spirit - the music in London will not be enough to satisfy her.</t1555> <t1556>And speaking of books!</t1556> <t1557>Thomson, Cowper, Scott - she will buy and buy more works: I believe she will buy all the prints to prevent them from falling into unworthy hands, she will buy all the titles that guide her on how to admire a dry tree.</t1557> <t1558>Isn't that right, Marianne? Pardon me, if I am too blunt.</t1558> <t1559>But I am willing to show you that I have not forgotten our debates.</t1559>
<t1560>- Edward, I like to be reminded of the past - whether gloomy or lively, I want to recall it - and you will never offend me by talking about the bygone days.</t1560> <t1561>You are very right in assuming how I would spend my money - a bit of money, at least my spare change, would surely be used to supplement my music and book collection.</t1561>
<t1562>- And the majority of her estate will be paid periodically to the authors or their heirs.</t1562>
<t1563>- No, Edward, I have to spend on something else.</t1563>
<t1564>- Then, perhaps she will use it as a reward for the person who wrote the best defense for the proverb she likes, which is that no one is loved more than once in their life - her steadfast opinion on this point, right?</t1564>
<t1565>- Surely.</t1565> <t1566>At my age, my thoughts have settled in an acceptable manner.</t1566> <t1567>It is unlikely now that I will see or hear anything that could change these thoughts.</t1567>
<t1568>Elinor said:</t1568>
<t1569>- You see, Marianne is still as steadfast as ever.</t1569> <t1570>She will not change at all.</t1570>
<t1571>- She is just a little more solemn than before.</t1571>
<t1572>Marianne said:</t1572>
<t1573>- No, Edward, you shouldn't blame me.</t1573> <t1574>It's you who is not very lively.</t1574>
<t1575>He sighed:</t1575>
<t1576>- Why do you think so? But being lively has never been a part of my personality.</t1576>
<t1577>Elinor said:</t1577>
<t1578>- I don't think this is part of Marianne's personality either.</t1578> <t1579>I can hardly call Marianne a lively girl; she is very enthusiastic, very eager in everything she does - sometimes talks a lot, always energetic - but she is not necessarily often truly happy.</t1579>
<t1580>He replied:</t1580>
<t1581>- I believe you are right, however, I always see her as a lively young woman.</t1581>
<t1582>Elinor said:</t1582>
<t1583>- I often find myself having such a flaw, when I completely misunderstand someone's personality in one aspect or another: imagining them to be more lively or more serious, or more intelligent or more foolish than they actually are; and I cannot say why or where the misunderstanding comes from.</t1583> <t1584>Sometimes people are led by what they say themselves, very often by what others say to them, without taking the time to think and judge.</t1584>
<t1585>Marianne said:</t1585>
<t1586>- Sister Elinor, but I think being completely led by others is necessary.</t1586> <t1587>I see that the judgments attributed to us merely conform to the judgments of our neighbors.</t1587> <t1588>I am sure that has always been your framework of rules.</t1588>
<t1589>- No, Marianne, never.</t1589> <t1590>Your sense of propriety never aims to submit to understanding.</t1590> <t1591>All that I have tried to influence is behavior.</t1591> <t1592>You should not confuse my thoughts.</t1592> <t1593>To be honest, I often wish you would care more about our neighbors; but have I ever advised you to adopt their sentiments or follow their judgments in serious matters?</t1593>
<t1594>Edward said to Elinor:</t1594>
<t1595>- She was unable to persuade her younger sister to accept her framework of rules.</t1595> <t1596>She didn't achieve anything, did she?</t1596>
<t1597>Elinor sent a meaningful look to Marianne:</t1597>
<t1598>- Got nothing.</t1598>
<t1599>He responded:</t1599>
<t1600>- My judgment is entirely on your side, but I fear the way I carry it out is somewhat like your sister.</t1600> <t1601>I never mean to offend, but I am shy in a foolish way, often appearing inattentive when I am merely clumsy by nature.</t1601> <t1602>I often think that my natural disposition is to favor the lower class; I am not very comfortable among strangers of the noble class.</t1602>
<t1603>Elinor said:</t1603>
<t1604>- Marianne is not at all shy but forgives her indifference.</t1604>
<t1605>Elinor replied:</t1605>
<t1606>- She knows her worth too well to misattribute blame.</t1606> <t1607>Shyness is merely the result of an inferiority complex in one way or another.</t1607> <t1608>If I could convince myself that my demeanor is entirely comfortable and graceful, I would not feel shy.</t1608>
<t1609>Marianne said:</t1609>
<t1610>- But you are still being reserved, which is even worse.</t1610>
<t1611>Edward was surprised:</t1611>
<t1612>- Mind your manners!</t1612> <t1613>Do I really mind my manners, Marianne?</t1613>
<t1614>- Yes, very reserved.</t1614>
<t1615>He blushed:</t1615>
<t1616>- I don't understand you.</t1616> <t1617>Keep your distance! - how, in what way? What should I say to you?</t1617> <t1618>What do you expect me to do?</t1618>
<t1619>Elinor showed surprise at seeing him moved; but tried to laugh it off, saying to him:</t1619>
<t1620>- Don't you know her well enough to understand what she means?</t1620> <t1621>Don't you know that anyone who doesn't speak as quickly as she does and doesn't admire what she admires is called reserved by her?</t1621>
<t1622>Edward did not answer.</t1622> <t1623>He returned with a serious and contemplative demeanor, sitting for a long time in silence and in a daze.</t1623>
<t1624>Chapter 18</t1624>
<t1625>Elinor observed her friend's downcast demeanor and felt uneasy.</t1625> <t1626>His visit brought her only a little satisfaction, while he seemed not to be entirely happy.</t1626> <t1627>It was evident that he was not happy; she also hoped it was evident that he still treated her in a special way compared to others, as she had once been sure of; but up to this moment, it seemed uncertain if he was still the same.</t1627> <t1628>His reserved attitude towards her for a moment contradicted what his lively eyes had previously conveyed.</t1628>
<t1629>And</t1629>
<t1630>The next morning, he met her and Marianne in the breakfast room before the others came down.</t1630> <t1631>Marianne was always eager to hasten their happiness as quickly as possible, so she wanted the two to have privacy together.</t1631> <t1632>But before she had climbed halfway up the stairs, she heard the hallway door open and, looking back, she was surprised to see it was Edward himself going out.</t1632>
<t1633>He said:</t1633>
<t1634>- I am going to the village to check on my horses, as the family is not yet ready for breakfast; I will be back shortly.</t1634>
<t1635>Edward returned with more praise for the scenery around the area.</t1635> <t1636>On the way to the village, he saw many beautiful valley views.</t1636> <t1637>The village is situated higher than the vacation house, from here opening up a panoramic view that he found very delightful.</t1637> <t1638>This was a topic that caught Marianne's attention, and she began to express her own praise for these landscapes, asking him more detailed questions about what he liked the most.</t1638>
<t1639>Edward interrupted her:</t1639>
<t1640>- Marianne, you should not inquire too far; please remember I have no knowledge of landscapes.</t1640> <t1641>Through ignorance and poor aesthetic sense, I will offend you if we discuss details.</t1641> <t1642>I will call the slopes inclined rather than majestically steep; the ground strange and wild rather than undulating and rolling; the scenery beyond sight rather than distant and hazy through the mist.</t1642> <t1643>You should be satisfied with the way I describe things plainly.</t1643> <t1644>I call this land beautiful: the sloping hills, the patches of forest with good timber, the valleys looking comfortable and cozy, with fertile meadows, here and there a few neat farms.</t1644> <t1645>All of it aligns with my idea of a beautiful land, because it harmonizes beauty with utility; and I am sure this place is also poetic, because you appreciate it.</t1645> <t1646>I can easily believe there are also rocks and promontories, gray moss and thickets, but I do not recognize them.</t1646> <t1647>I know nothing about the poetic aspect.</t1647>
<t1648>Marianne said:</t1648>
<t1649>- I'm afraid you're right, but why do you boast like that?</t1649>
<t1650>Elinor said:</t1650>
<t1651>- She guessed that by avoiding one emotion, Edward would indulge in another.</t1651> <t1652>Because he believed that many people pretended to praise beauty more than they actually felt it.</t1652> <t1653>He despised such deceit, so when admiring beauty, he wanted to be more indifferent and less discerning than his soul.</t1653> <t1654>He was meticulous, and from that, he would adopt a pretense.</t1654>
<t1655>Marianne said:</t1655>
<t1656>- Indeed, the act of admiring the scenery has turned into mere jargon.</t1656> <t1657>People pretend to feel and struggle to express through the aesthetics and sophistication of the first person who defined what a poetic landscape is.</t1657> <t1658>I have an aversion to all kinds of jargon, sometimes I keep my feelings to myself, because I can't find any words to express them except through the boring clichés of perception and meaning.</t1658>
<t1659>Edward said:</t1659>
<t1660>- I believe you truly feel a certain delight with a delicate landscape that you think you have perceived.</t1660> <t1661>But, in response, your sister must allow me to feel nothing other than what I describe.</t1661> <t1662>I like delicate landscapes, but not based on principles of poetic beauty.</t1662> <t1663>I do not like trees that are broken, twisted, and withered.</t1663> <t1664>I am fascinated by tall, majestic trees, straight and lush with foliage.</t1664> <t1665>I do not like ruined, dilapidated cottages.</t1665> <t1666>I do not love brambles, nettles, or heather.</t1666> <t1667>I love a cozy farmhouse more than a watchtower; orderly, peaceful villages more than the most valiant bandits in the world.</t1667>
<t1668>Marianne looked at Edward with pleasant surprise, and at her sister with pity.</t1668> <t1669>Elinor just smiled.</t1669>
<t1670>They did not argue further; and Marianne fell silent in contemplation, until she suddenly noticed an object.</t1670> <t1671>She was sitting next to Edward, and while receiving a cup of tea from Mrs. Dashwood, his hand extended right in front of her, clearly showing a ring with a lock of hair.</t1671> <t1672>She exclaimed:</t1672>
<t1673>- Edward, I have never seen you wear a ring.</t1673> <t1674>Is this Fanny's hair?</t1674> <t1675>I remember hearing her promise to give you some hair.</t1675> <t1676>But I thought her hair was darker.</t1676>
<t1677>Marianne spoke her mind without hesitation; but when she saw how much she had embarrassed Edward, her remorse for her thoughtlessness could not be less than his embarrassment.</t1677>
<t1678>He blushed deeply, then glanced at Elinor and replied:</t1678>
<t1679>- Yes, this is my sister's hair.</t1679> <t1680>When attached to a ring, hair always appears darker, you know.</t1680>
<t1681>Elinor met his gaze, appearing as composed as he was.</t1681> <t1682>Like Marianne, she was reassured that this was indeed his sister's hair; however, their conclusions were different.</t1682> <t1683>While Marianne believed it was a gift from his sister, she guessed it was either stolen or part of some arrangement she was unaware of.</t1683> <t1684>Nevertheless, she did not feel humiliated.</t1684> <t1685>Pretending not to notice what had happened, she immediately switched to another topic.</t1685> <t1686>In her mind, she resolved to seize every opportunity from now on to examine the lock of hair and confirm it was indeed his sister's hair color.</t1686>
<t1687>Edward was confused for a long time, then calmed down in contemplation.</t1687> <t1688>He was particularly solemn throughout the morning.</t1688> <t1689>Marianne severely blamed herself for her words; but the habit of self-forgiveness might be even quicker, as she could not imagine how much she had offended her sister.</t1689>
<t1690>Before noon, Sir John and Mrs. Jennings visited them to check on him after hearing that a nobleman had come to visit the cottage.</t1690> <t1691>With the support of his mother-in-law, Sir John soon discovered that Ferrars' name began with the letter F, and this provided him with material to tease Elinor in the future, but he did not start now because they had only just met Edward.</t1691> <t1692>Through the knowing glances, she only realized how much they had learned from Margaret's guidance.</t1692>
<t1693>Mr. John never visited the Daswood family without inviting them to dinner the next day, or to tea that evening.</t1693> <t1694>On this occasion, to make the guest happier and because he himself was pleased to contribute, he invited the guest to join as well.</t1694> <t1695>He said:</t1695>
<t1696>- You must come have tea with us tonight because we are quite lonely; and tomorrow you must come have dinner with us because we will have many people.</t1696>
<t1697>Mrs. Jennings emphasized the necessity of doing:</t1697>
<t1698>- And who knows, you might start a dance.</t1698> <t1699>That is quite appealing to her, Marianne.</t1699>
<t1700>Marianne exclaimed:</t1700>
<t1701>- Dance! Impossible! Who will dance?</t1701>
<t1702>- Who else! It's you ladies, and then there's the Careys and the Whitakers, surely.</t1702> <t1703>What! You think no one will dance because some unnamed person has left!</t1703>
<t1704>The day John exclaimed:</t1704>
<t1705>- With all my heart, I wish Willoughby would return to us.</t1705>
<t1706>This sentence, along with Marianne's blushing face, made Edward curious.</t1706> <t1707>He quietly asked Miss Dashwood, who was sitting next to him:</t1707>
<t1708>- Who is Willoughby?</t1708>
<t1709>She responded briefly.</t1709> <t1710>Marianne's expression became even more meaningful.</t1710> <t1711>Edward looked and not only understood the implications of the others, but also read Marianne's feelings, which had previously puzzled him.</t1711> <t1712>When the two guests left, he immediately went to her and whispered:</t1712>
<t1713>- I guessed it.</t1713> <t1714>Should I tell you what I guessed?</t1714>
<t1715>- What do you mean?</t1715>
<t1716>- Should I say it?</t1716>
<t1717>- Okay.</t1717>
<t1718>- So, I guess Mr. Willoughby likes hunting.</t1718>
<t1719>Marianne was surprised and embarrassed, yet she couldn't help but smile at his quiet mischievousness.</t1719> <t1720>After a moment of silence, she said:</t1720>
<t1721>- Oh, Edward! How did you guess?</t1721> <t1722>But there will come a time, I hope... I believe you will like him.</t1722>
<t1723>- I'm sure of it.</t1723>
<t1724>He was surprised to see her so lively and passionate; because if he didn't understand that it was a joke based on something or nothing at all between him and Willoughby, he certainly wouldn't have mentioned the other person's name.</t1724>
<t1725>Chapter 19</t1725>
<t1726>Edward stayed at the holiday house for a week.</t1726> <t1727>Mrs. Daswood earnestly urged him to stay longer; but as if self-tormenting, he seemed determined to leave when the fun with his friends was at its peak.</t1727> <t1728>In the last two or three days, his spirits improved significantly though still fluctuating - he grew more and more fond of the house and the surroundings - never spoke of parting without a sigh - indicated that his time was entirely unoccupied - even unsure of where he would go upon leaving them; but nevertheless, he had to go.</t1728>
<t1729>E</t1729>
<t1730>Never had a week passed by so quickly; he could hardly believe that time was running out.</t1730> <t1731>He repeated this over and over; he also talked about other things to hide his disturbed feelings and to lie about his actions.</t1731> <t1732>He found no joy at Norland. He hated staying in the city; but he had to go, either to Norland or to London.</t1732> <t1733>He valued their kindness above anything else; his greatest happiness was being close to them.</t1733> <t1734>However, he had to leave them at the end of the week, even though they didn't want him to and he didn't want to, even though his time was not limited.</t1734>
<t1735>Elinor believed that his mother had caused his surprising attitude.</t1735> <t1736>Fortunately for her, she understood his mother very well, who was the reason for all the peculiarities in her son.</t1736> <t1737>Despite being disappointed and frustrated, sometimes annoyed by his ambiguous attitude, she still wanted to think well of his actions.</t1737> <t1738>Such impartiality and generosity were demanded by her own mother to defend Willoughby.</t1738> <t1739>His weak spirit, lack of openness and consistency, were largely due to his inability to be independent, and he knew better than anyone about Mrs. Ferrars' attitudes and intentions.</t1739> <t1740>The short visit, insisting on leaving, all stemmed from the same tendency to submit to necessary constraints to appease his mother.</t1740> <t1741>The long-standing complaint about duty conflicting with desire, parents conflicting with children, was the cause of it all.</t1741> <t1742>She would be glad to know when these difficulties would end, the opposition would yield, - when Mrs. Ferrars would be reformed and her son would be free to seek his own happiness.</t1742>
<t1743>But from such hopeless desires, she was compelled to seek solace in the restoration of her faith in Edward's affection, in the recollection of every glance or word of his during his stay here, and above all, in the evidence of that honor which he often wore on his finger.</t1743>
<t1744>When sitting down for breakfast the next morning, Mrs. Daswood said:</t1744>
<t1745>- Edward, I think you would be happier if you had a career to spend your time and mind on plans and work.</t1745> <t1746>Your friends will be at a disadvantage because you won't be able to spend much time with them.</t1746> <t1747>But (she smiled) you will have a specific advantage in at least one aspect: you will know where to go when you leave them.</t1747>
<t1748>He answered:</t1748>
<t1749>- Please believe that I have long thought about this matter.</t1749> <t1750>From before, now, and perhaps forever after, I have been severely unhappy without a job, without a profession to keep me busy, or to create something for me like an independent position.</t1750> <t1751>But unfortunately, my delicacy, and the delicacy of my relatives, have made me the person I am now: idle, useless.</t1751> <t1752>We never agreed with each other when choosing a profession for me.</t1752> <t1753>I always liked working for the church, and I still do.</t1753> <t1754>But my family thought that was not prestigious enough.</t1754> <t1755>They advised me to join the military.</t1755> <t1756>But that was too high for me.</t1756> <t1757>The legal profession creates moderately affluent people: many young men have succeeded, with very impressive styles in the upper class, driving around the city in two-wheeled carriages looking very dashing.</t1757> <t1758>But I was not enthusiastic about the law profession even in this not very difficult field, though my family accepted it.</t1758> <t1759>As for the navy, that branch creates style, but when I thought about it, I was already too old.</t1759> <t1760>And, finally, I was not compelled to have any profession at all.</t1760> <t1761>Without needing to wear a red coat, I could still be dashing and affluent like an idle person, and an eighteen-year-old young man not eager to be busy.</t1761> <t1762>Therefore, I attended Oxford University and have been idle since then.</t1762>
<t1763>Mrs. Dashwood said:</t1763>
<t1764>- Because idleness does not bring you happiness, I guess the consequence of this is that your sons will be educated to pursue various professions, like Columella 2.</t1764>
<t1765>He is serious:</t1765>
<t1766>- They will be educated to be as different from me as possible - different in feelings, in actions, in living conditions, in everything.</t1766>
<t1767>- Hey, hey, Edward, this is an outburst from a weak spirit.</t1767> <t1768>You are in a state of melancholy, imagining that anyone who is not like you must be happy.</t1768> <t1769>But you should remember that everyone is equally sad when parting from friends, regardless of their level of education or aesthetic sense.</t1769> <t1770>You need to recognize your own happiness.</t1770> <t1771>You lack nothing except patience - or, in more appealing terms, hope.</t1771> <t1772>The time will come when your mother will grant you the independence you desire; it is her duty, and it will be her duty; soon she will be happy to see that your youth is not wasted in discontent.</t1772> <t1773>A few months wasted, how much is that?</t1773>
<t1774>Edward replied:</t1774>
<t1775>- I think I might need several months to do something good for myself.</t1775>
<t1776>The feeling of depression, although Mrs. Daswood did not understand it, made everyone sadder as the evening of farewell approached; it left a particularly uneasy impression on Elinor's emotions, one that would take effort and time to suppress.</t1776> <t1777>But since she was determined to suppress it and did not want to reveal a sadness heavier than the family already felt due to the separation, she did not follow the method that Marianne cleverly applied in similar situations by retreating into silence, solitude, and idleness.</t1777> <t1778>The manner of the two sisters differed as much as their goals differed, both suitable for achieving their respective aims.</t1778>
<t1779>As soon as he left the house, Elinor sat down at the writing desk, finding work to keep herself busy all day, neither suggesting nor avoiding anyone mentioning his name, appearing as if she was fully focused on the household chores.</t1779> <t1780>If in this way she could not alleviate her sorrow, at least it did not grow heavier, thus her mother and two sisters did not have to worry about her.</t1780>
<t1781>For Marianne, this demeanor was entirely contrary to her own, seeming neither very commendable nor her own demeanor very flawed.</t1781> <t1782>She easily identified the demeanor of self-restraint: with deep feelings, it was not worth restraining.</t1782> <t1783>She did not deny, but blushed when admitting, that her sister's feelings were indeed calm.</t1783> <t1784>As for her own resolve, she provided clear evidence that she still loved and respected her sister.</t1784>
<t1785>Do not shut yourself off from your family, or step out of the house in solitude to escape them, or lie awake all night to ponder; at different moments of each day, Elinor could leisurely think about Edward and about Edward's attitude in various states of mind - affectionate, sympathetic, accepting, reproachful, doubtful.</t1785> <t1786>There were many moments when, if not due to the absence of her mother or two sisters, then at least due to their being busy, no one spoke to each other, she was left alone to live with herself.</t1786> <t1787>Of course, her mind was free; her thoughts were not bound elsewhere.</t1787> <t1788>The past and the present had to be before her, had to compel her to pay attention, and occupy her memories, her reflections, her dreams.</t1788>
<t1789>From such dreamy thoughts, while sitting at her writing desk one morning, not long after Edward had left them, she was awakened by the arrival of guests.</t1789> <t1790>She was sitting alone in the room.</t1790> <t1791>She heard the sound of the garden gate in front of the house, glanced through the window, and saw a large group of people approaching the main door.</t1791> <t1792>Among them were Sir John, Lady Middleton, and Mrs. Jennings, but there were also two others, a man and a woman, whom she did not know.</t1792> <t1793>She was sitting near the window, and as soon as Sir John saw her, he separated from the group performing the ritual of knocking on the door to walk across the lawn, compelling her to open the window to talk to him, though there was only a short distance between the window and the main door, making it difficult for them to converse without being overheard by the others.</t1793>
<t1794>He said:</t1794>
<t1795>- Hey, we brought some strangers.</t1795> <t1796>What do you think of them?</t1796>
<t1797>- Shh! They can hear us.</t1797>
<t1798>- Even if they hear, it doesn't matter.</t1798> <t1799>That's the Palmer couple. I can say Charlotte is very pretty.</t1799> <t1800>You can see her if you look this way.</t1800>
<t1801>Since Elinor was sure to meet this lady in a few minutes without being so abrupt, she declined.</t1801>
<t1802>- Where is Marianne?</t1802> <t1803>Did she run away because we arrived?</t1803> <t1804>I see the piano is still open.</t1804>
<t1805>- I guess she is taking a walk.</t1805>
<t1806>Mrs. Jennings came over, as she couldn't wait for the door to open to tell her story.</t1806> <t1807>She called out to the window:</t1807>
<t1808>- How are you, my dear? Is Mrs. Daswood well? And where are your sisters?</t1808> <t1809>What! Alone! You will be pleased to have a small group sitting with you.</t1809> <t1810>I brought my son-in-law and my daughter to meet you.</t1810> <t1811>Just think, they suddenly arrived here!</t1811> <t1812>I think I heard the sound of a carriage last night while we were having tea, but I didn't expect that they had arrived.</t1812> <t1813>I thought of nothing else but that Colonel Brandon might come; so I told Sir John, I am sure I heard the sound of a carriage; perhaps Colonel Brandon is coming.</t1813>
<t1814>In the middle of the conversation with the lady, Elinor had to turn her head the other way to greet the others in the group.</t1814> <t1815>Lady Middleton introduced two strangers. At the same time, Mrs. Dashwood and Margaret came down the stairs.</t1815> <t1816>They all sat down looking at each other, while Mrs. Jennings continued her story as she walked into the hallway, with Sir John beside her.</t1816>
<t1817>Mrs. Palmer was a few years younger than Lady Middleton, and completely different in every respect.</t1817> <t1818>She was short and plump, with a very pretty face, every feature exuding humor.</t1818> <t1819>Her manners were not as refined as her sister-in-law's, but she was more charming.</t1819> <t1820>She entered with a smile - smiling throughout the visit except when she burst into laughter, and smiling as she left.</t1820>
<t1821>The husband had a stern look at the age of twenty-six or twenty-seven, with a fashionable demeanor and more awareness, but was not willing to take pleasure or make others happy.</t1821> <t1822>He entered the room with an air of self-importance, slightly bowed his head to greet the women without saying a word, and after observing them and the house, picked up a newspaper on the table and read continuously throughout the evening.</t1822>
<t1823>On the contrary, Mrs. Palmer had a disposition that was both polite and cheerful, and as soon as she sat down, she couldn't help but praise the hallway and everything in it.</t1823>
<t1824>- Hey! What an interesting room! I've never seen anywhere so charming! Mother, think about how beautifully the house has been decorated compared to when I was here! I've always thought this was a cozy place, mother (turning to Mrs. Daswood), but you've made it charming! Sister, (speaking to Lady Middleton) look, everything is so delightful!</t1824> <t1825>How is it that I also like the house so much!</t1825> <t1826>Mr. Palmer, do you like it?</t1826>
<t1827>Mr. Palmer did not answer her, not even lifting his eyes from the newspaper.</t1827>
<t1828>She smiled:</t1828>
<t1829>- Mr. Palmer doesn't listen to me, sometimes he never listens.</t1829> <t1830>It's really strange.</t1830>
<t1831>This was quite new to Mrs. Daswood; she was not accustomed to mocking anyone for a lack of concern, and could not help but show surprise towards both of them.</t1831>
<t1832>At this moment, Mrs. Jennings spoke loudly, continuing to recount her surprise from the previous evening when she had just realized the guests had arrived, talking incessantly until she finished her story.</t1832> <t1833>Mrs. Palmer laughed heartily when reminded of their surprise; and two or three times everyone agreed that it was a delightful surprise.</t1833>
<t1834>Leaning towards Elinor and in a voice so soft as if not wanting anyone else to hear though they were all gathered in the room, Mrs. Jennings added:</t1834>
<t1835>- Everyone might believe how happy we are; but, nonetheless, I can't help wishing they wouldn't drive so fast, or go such a long distance, because they went around London to take care of some business, as everyone knows (nodding solemnly and pointing to her daughter), it's not suitable for my daughter's condition.</t1835> <t1836>I wanted her to stay home and rest this morning, but she insisted on coming with us; she was eager to meet everyone here.</t1836>
<t1837>Mrs. Palmer laughed and said she was fine.</t1837>
<t1838>Mrs. Jennings continued:</t1838>
<t1839>- She will have to be in confinement in February.</t1839>
<t1840>Mrs. Middleton could no longer endure such a conversation, so she tried to ask Mr. Palmer if there was any news in the paper.</t1840> <t1841>He replied that there was nothing, then continued reading.</t1841>
<t1842>Sir John exclaimed:</t1842>
<t1843>- Hey, Marianne is here.</t1843> <t1844>Now, Palmer, you will see a terribly beautiful young lady.</t1844>
<t1845>He immediately went out to the hallway, opened the main door, and personally escorted her in.</t1845> <t1846>As soon as she entered the room, Mrs. Jennings asked if she had gone to Allenham; and Mrs. Palmer laughed heartily as if to show she understood.</t1846> <t1847>Mr. Palmer only looked up when she entered, glanced at her for a moment, then returned to his newspaper.</t1847> <t1848>Mrs. Palmer's eyes were now fixed on the paintings hanging around the room.</t1848> <t1849>She stood up to take a closer look.</t1849>
<t1850>- Oh! How beautiful these paintings are! Hey! They look so interesting! Mom, look, how cute they are!</t1850> <t1851>I dare say quite captivating; I could admire them forever.</t1851>
<t1852>Then she sat down, and soon forgot that such paintings were hanging in the room.</t1852>
<t1853>When Mrs. Middleton stood up to leave, Mr. Palmer also stood up, put down the newspaper, stretched his body, and looked around at everyone.</t1853>
<t1854>His wife laughed:</t1854>
<t1855>- Honey, did you doze off?</t1855>
<t1856>He did not reply; and after glancing around the room, he only remarked that the roof was too steep and the ceiling was sagging.</t1856> <t1857>Then he bowed and left with the others.</t1857>
<t1858>Sir John urgently invited everyone to Barton Park the next day.</t1858> <t1859>Mrs. Dashwood did not want to dine with them more often than they dined at the cottage, so she firmly refused for herself; as for her three daughters, it was up to them.</t1859> <t1860>But the girls were not curious to see how the Palmers dined, so they thought it would not be enjoyable with them.</t1860> <t1861>Therefore, they also wanted to decline; the weather was unpredictable and seemed not to be good.</t1861> <t1862>But Sir John was not satisfied; he would send a carriage to pick them up, and they had to come.</t1862> <t1863>Lady Middleton was the same: although she did not press the mother, she urged the three daughters.</t1863> <t1864>Mrs. Jennings and Miss Palmer also joined in the entreaties, all seemingly wanting to avoid a gathering limited to just the family; and the three young ladies had to accept.</t1864>
<t1865>As soon as they left, Marianne lamented:</t1865>
<t1866>- Why did they invite us?</t1866> <t1867>The rent for this vacation house is said to be low; but we rented it under strict conditions that we have to dine with them whenever anyone visits them, or they visit us.</t1867>
<t1868>Elinor said:</t1868>
<t1869>- Through these frequent invitations, they are no less polite or kind compared to the invitations from a few weeks ago.</t1869> <t1870>It is not they who have changed if their gatherings have become tedious and dull.</t1870> <t1871>We must seek the change elsewhere.</t1871>
<t1872>Chapter 20</t1872>
<t1873>The next day, when the Daswood ladies entered the family room of Barton Park through one door, Miss Palmer ran in from the other door, still looking as humorous and lively as ever.</t1873> <t1874>She took the hands of the three in the most affectionate manner, expressing great joy at seeing them again.</t1874>
<t1875>N</t1875>
<t1876>Sitting between Elinor and Marianne, she said:</t1876>
<t1877>- I am very happy to meet you, because today would be boring if you didn't come; this would be shocking, because we are leaving tomorrow.</t1877> <t1878>You know, we have to leave because the Westons are visiting us.</t1878> <t1879>The trip here was quite unexpected, and I didn't know anything until the carriage arrived at the gate, and then Mr. Palmer asked me if I wanted to go to Barton with him.</t1879> <t1880>He is so funny!</t1880> <t1881>He never talks to me! I regret that my husband and I cannot stay longer, however, I hope we will meet again in the city.</t1881>
<t1882>The three daughters were forced to end this expectation.</t1882>
<t1883>Ms. Palmer smiled and exclaimed:</t1883>
<t1884>- Not going to the city! I will be quite disappointed if you don't go.</t1884> <t1885>I will find the most beautiful house on earth for you, next to our house, in Hanover Square. You must come, really.</t1885> <t1886>I am sure I will be very happy to be your guardian anytime until I have to be confined, if Mrs. Daswood does not like to go out in public.</t1886>
<t1887>The three ladies expressed their gratitude but were compelled to resist all entreaties.</t1887>
<t1888>Mrs. Palmer called to her husband, who had just walked in:</t1888>
<t1889>- Hey, my love, you have to help me persuade the Daswood ladies to go to the city this winter.</t1889>
<t1890>Her beloved did not reply, and after gently bowing to the women, he began to complain about the weather.</t1890> <t1891>He said:</t1891>
<t1892>- It's terrifying! Weather like this makes everything and everyone dreadful.</t1892> <t1893>When it rains, both indoors and outdoors are equally dull.</t1893> <t1894>It makes us loathe everyone we know.</t1894> <t1895>What on earth was Sir John thinking by not having a billiard room in his house? Few people understand what comfort is! Sir John is as foolish as the weather.</t1895>
<t1896>The remaining people arrived shortly.</t1896>
<t1897>Mr. John said:</t1897>
<t1898>- Miss Marianne, I'm afraid today you won't be able to take your usual walk to Allenham.</t1898>
<t1899>Marianne appeared very serious and said nothing.</t1899>
<t1900>Ms. Palmer said:</t1900>
<t1901>- Hey, you shouldn't be so secretive with us, because we already know everything, just to put you at ease; and I really admire your taste, because I think he is incredibly handsome.</t1901> <t1902>You know, we don't live very far from him - I can say not more than ten miles.</t1902>
<t1903>Her husband said:</t1903>
<t1904>- Almost thirty miles.</t1904>
<t1905>- Ah, I see! Not much difference.</t1905> <t1906>I've never been to his house, but they say it's quite a lovely place.</t1906>
<t1907>Mr. Palmer said:</t1907>
<t1908>- A most disgusting place never seen before.</t1908>
<t1909>Marianne remained completely silent, although her expression showed that she was attentively listening to their conversation.</t1909>
<t1910>Ms. Palmer continued:</t1910>
<t1911>- Is it really that bad? Then I guess there must be some other house that beautiful.</t1911>
<t1912>When everyone sat down at the table, Sir John regretfully remarked that there were only eight people.</t1912> <t1913>He said to his wife:</t1913>
<t1914>- My love, having so few people like this is very provocative.</t1914> <t1915>Why don't you invite the Gilberts over today?</t1915>
<t1916>- Mr. John, did I not say before when you asked about this that it couldn't be done?</t1916> <t1917>They came to have a meal with us last time.</t1917>
<t1918>Mrs. Jennings said:</t1918>
<t1919>- Sir John, you and I, we should not adhere to such formalities.</t1919>
<t1920>Mr. Palmer exclaimed:</t1920>
<t1921>- Then she has no manners.</t1921>
<t1922>His wife spoke with her characteristic laugh:</t1922>
<t1923>- Darling, you are conflicting with everyone.</t1923> <t1924>Do you know you are quite rude?</t1924>
<t1925>- You don't know who you contradicted when you said my mother is not well-mannered.</t1925>
<t1926>The easygoing mother-in-law said:</t1926>
<t1927>- Fine, you can insult me as much as you like, you took Charlotte from me and cannot give her back.</t1927> <t1928>Therefore, I have the upper hand over you.</t1928>
<t1929>Charlotte laughed heartily when she thought that her husband couldn't get rid of her, feeling triumphant and saying she didn't care how angry he got with her because they had to live together.</t1929> <t1930>It is hard to find someone as easy-going or always wanting to be cheerful as Mrs. Palmer. Her husband's indifferent, sullen, and discontented nature did not make her suffer; and when he scolded or insulted her, she easily changed the subject.</t1930>
<t1931>She whispered to Elinor:</t1931>
<t1932>- Mr. Palmer is really peculiar! He doesn't know how to have fun at all.</t1932>
<t1933>After a bit of observation, Elinor did not find him truly ill-tempered or as lacking in gentlemanly manners as he wanted to appear.</t1933> <t1934>Like many other men, his temperament perhaps became a little irritable when he realized he was the husband of a very foolish woman after being inexplicably attracted by her beauty; but his wife knew that such behavior was too common for any sensitive man to be hurt for long.</t1934> <t1935>She believed this was merely a unique desire that made him despise everyone, insulting everything in his sight.</t1935> <t1936>This was the longing to appear superior to others.</t1936> <t1937>Such a common motivation that it should not be surprising; but such impolite behavior made it so that no one, except his wife, could get close to him.</t1937>
<t1938>A moment later, Ms. Palmer said:</t1938>
<t1939>- Ah, dear Miss Daswood, I want you and your sister to grant me a favor.</t1939> <t1940>This Christmas, could you two come to visit Cleveland?</t1940> <t1941>Please, accept, - and come visit us along with the Weston family.</t1941> <t1942>You can't imagine how delighted I would be! It will be so much fun!</t1942>
<t1943>Turning to her husband, she continued:</t1943>
<t1944>- Darling, do you want the two Miss Daswoods to come to Cleveland?</t1944>
<t1945>He sniffled:</t1945>
<t1946>- Certainly.</t1946> <t1947>You came to Devonshire with no other intention.</t1947>
<t1948>Your wife said:</t1948>
<t1949>- Hey, you see, Mr. Palmer is expecting you; so you can't refuse.</t1949>
<t1950>Both of them firmly refused the invitation.</t1950>
<t1951>- But indeed, you two must come and will come.</t1951> <t1952>I am sure you two will like everything. The Westons will stay with us, it will be fun.</t1952> <t1953>You two cannot know how charming Cleveland is, and at that time we will be lively, because Mr. Palmer is always going around campaigning against the election.</t1953> <t1954>Therefore, many people whom I have never met come to dine with us, quite exciting!</t1954> <t1955>But, poor him!</t1955> <t1956>He is very hard-working! Because he is obliged to make everyone like him.</t1956>
<t1957>Elinor could not maintain her composure when she agreed to such a burdensome duty.</t1957>
<t1958>Charlotte said:</t1958>
<t1959>- When he works in Parliament, it sounds so fascinating! Doesn't it?</t1959> <t1960>I find it so ridiculous! It's so strange to see all the letters addressed to him with "M.</t1960> <t1961>P." - Member of Parliament.</t1961> <t1962>But do you know, he says he will never be straightforward with me?</t1962> <t1963>He declared that.</t1963> <t1964>Isn't that right, Mr. Palmer?</t1964>
<t1965>Mr. Palmer paid no attention to her.</t1965>
<t1966>She continued:</t1966>
<t1967>- He couldn't stand having to write, he said it was really shocking.</t1967>
<t1968>He said:</t1968>
<t1969>- No, I have never said anything as absurd as that.</t1969> <t1970>Don't attribute all the misuse of language to me.</t1970>
<t1971>- There, you see how strange he is.</t1971> <t1972>He is always like that! Sometimes he doesn't talk to me for half a day, then he goes out with something really odd - all sorts of things in the world.</t1972>
<t1973>When they returned to the living room, she asked Elinor if she liked Mr. Palmer very much.</t1973>
<t1974>Elinor was very surprised and replied:</t1974>
<t1975>- Surely, you look very pleasant.</t1975>
<t1976>- Ah, I'm glad to see you like him.</t1976> <t1977>I thought so, he is very kind.</t1977> <t1978>I can tell you, Mr. Palmer is very pleased with you and your two sisters, and you cannot understand how disappointed he would be if you did not come to Cleveland. I cannot think of why you would refuse.</t1978>
<t1979>Elinor was again compelled to refuse the invitation, changing the subject to end all entreaties.</t1979> <t1980>She thought that since they lived in the same county, Mrs. Palmer might provide more details about Willoughby's character than could be gathered from the Middletons, who only knew him superficially; thus, she was eager for anyone to confirm his character to dispel Marianne's fears.</t1980> <t1981>She began by asking if they often saw him at Cleveland and if they were well acquainted with him.</t1981>
<t1982>Ms. Palmer said:</t1982>
<t1983>- Ah, yes; I know him very well.</t1983> <t1984>That's right, not because I have conversed with him, but I often see him in the city.</t1984> <t1985>For one reason or another, I have never been to Barton at the same time he returned to Allenham.</t1985> <t1986>Mother met him once here, but at that time I was visiting my uncle in Weymouth. However, I dare say I seldom see him in Somersetshire, just because unfortunately he and I do not come here at the same time.</t1986> <t1987>I believe he rarely comes to Combe; but even if he were here, I don't think Mr. Palmer would visit, because Mr. Willoughby is on the opposing side, you know, and besides, the road is far.</t1987> <t1988>I know why you are inquiring about him, well; your sister is going to marry him.</t1988> <t1989>I am terribly happy about this, because that way I will have her as a neighbor, you know.</t1989>
<t1990>Elinor said:</t1990>
<t1991>- Honestly, you know more about the matter than I do, if you have reason to believe there will be a marriage.</t1991>
<t1992>- Don't pretend to deny it, because you know, everyone has been talking about this.</t1992> <t1993>I assure you, I have heard about this in the city.</t1993>
<t1994>- Dear Ms. Palmer!</t1994>
<t1995>- I assure you on my honor.</t1995> <t1996>I met Colonel Brandon on Monday morning on Bond Street, just before I left the city, and it was he who told me.</t1996>
<t1997>- You have surprised me immensely.</t1997> <t1998>Colonel Brandon told you! You must be mistaken.</t1998> <t1999>I don't think someone like Colonel Brandon would spread such news to an unrelated person, even if it were accurate.</t1999>
<t2000>- But I assure you everything is exactly like that; let me tell you how things happened.</t2000> <t2001>When we met him, he turned around and walked with us; so we started talking about my brother and sister, and then this and that.</t2001> <t2002>Then I said to him: "Colonel, so, I hear a new family has moved into Barton Cottage, and I hear my old lady say these girls are very pretty, and one of them is going to marry Willoughby from Combe Magna.</t2002> <t2003>Is that right?</t2003> <t2004>Of course you must know because you visited Devonshire recently."</t2004>
<t2005>- And what did the Colonel say?</t2005>
<t2006>- Ah, he didn't say much; but it seemed like he already knew this was the truth, so from this moment I believe it is certain.</t2006> <t2007>I'm happy! When are you two getting married?</t2007>
<t2008>- Is Mr. Brandon still doing well?</t2008>
<t2009>- Ah! Yes, still healthy.</t2009> <t2010>He praises you a lot, only speaks well of you.</t2010>
<t2011>- I felt embarrassed by his compliment.</t2011> <t2012>He seems to be a very good person; I think he is very likable.</t2012>
<t2013>- I think so too.</t2013> <t2014>He is a very charismatic person, so it's a pity that he is so stern and dull.</t2014> <t2015>Mother said he also loves your sister.</t2015> <t2016>I assure you this is something to be proud of, because he rarely loves anyone.</t2016>
<t2017>- Is Mr. Willoughby well-known in Somersetshire?</t2017>
<t2018>- Ah! Yes, very much; - that is, I don't believe many people know him well, because Combe Magna is quite far; but I assure you they all have a great affection for him. Everywhere he goes, no one is as well-liked as he is, and you can tell your sister that.</t2018> <t2019>I swear on my honor that she is extremely fortunate to have him, for she is very beautiful and charming, so she deserves everything.</t2019> <t2020>However, I don't think she is much more beautiful than you, please believe me; because I think both of you are extremely beautiful, and I am sure Mr. Palmer thinks so too, although last night I couldn't get him to say it.</t2020>
<t2021>The news about dear Miss Palmer in Willoughby wasn't very significant, but even the smallest favorable tidbit about him made her happy.</t2021>
<t2022>Charlotte continued:</t2022>
<t2023>- I am very happy that we finally got to know each other.</t2023> <t2024>Now I hope we will always be best friends.</t2024> <t2025>You don't know how long I've been looking forward to meeting you! It's so nice that you are staying at the vacation house.</t2025> <t2026>I am sure there is nothing better!</t2026> <t2027>And I am very happy to hear that your sister is getting married! I hope you will love Combe Magna 1.</t2027> <t2028>This is a lovely place in every aspect.</t2028>
<t2029>- You've known Colonel Brandon for a long time, haven't you?</t2029>
<t2030>- Yes, quite a long time; since my sister got married.</t2030> <t2031>I believe he is a special friend of Sir John.</t2031>
<t2032>Then lowering her voice, she continued:</t2032>
<t2033>- He would have been very pleased to marry me, if he could have married me.</t2033> <t2034>Both Sir John and Lady Middleton were very eager for this marriage.</t2034> <t2035>But my mother thought he was not suitable for me, otherwise Sir John would have spoken to the Colonel, and we could have married immediately.</t2035>
<t2036>- Did Colonel Brandon know about Sir John's opinion of her mother before?</t2036> <t2037>Did he love her?</t2037>
<t2038>- Ah, no; but if my mother hadn't opposed, I'm sure he would have accepted everything.</t2038> <t2039>He only met me no more than twice, because at that time I was still in school.</t2039> <t2040>However, now I am happier.</t2040> <t2041>Mr. Palmer is the type of man that I like.</t2041> <t2042><</t2042>
<t2043>Chapter 21</t2043>
<t2044>The Palmer couple returned to Cleveland the next day; the two families in Barton were once again on friendly terms.</t2044> <t2045>But this did not last long.</t2045> <t2046>As soon as Elinor had gotten the last of the guests out of her mind, wondering why Charlotte was so inexplicably happy, pondering Mr. Palmer's rustic behavior despite his considerable talents, and about the strangely mismatched couple, Sir John and Mrs. Jennings, for the sake of socializing, enthusiastically introduced two new acquaintances for them to observe and comment on.</t2046>
<t2047>V</t2047>
<t2048>During a morning outing in Exeter, they met two young women whom Mrs. Jennings was pleased to discover were related to her, which was enough for Sir John to invite the two to Barton Park as soon as their business in Exeter was finished.</t2048> <t2049>Their business in Exeter was immediately set aside due to such an invitation, and Lady Middleton was quite alarmed when Sir John returned to inform her that the family would be hosting two girls she had never met in her life.</t2049> <t2050>As for the elegant character of the two girls - even how acceptable their noble status might be - she had no evidence; for her husband's and mother's assurances were worth nothing.</t2050> <t2051>The familial relationship made the assurances even worse.</t2051> <t2052>Thus, Mrs. Jennings' attempts to console her daughter were unfortunately justified when she advised her not to pay attention to the girls' attire - simply because they were sisters, they had to compete with each other.</t2052>
<t2053>However, since it was impossible to prevent the two ladies from coming, Lady Middleton had to accept it with all the life philosophies of a well-bred woman, contenting herself with gently reproaching her husband five or six times a day.</t2053>
<t2054>Two young ladies arrived; their appearance was neither less noble nor unfashionable.</t2054> <t2055>Their outfits were truly elegant, their demeanor very courteous, they admired the house, and while enthusiastically praising the furnishings, they suddenly showed a deep affection for the children, so much so that less than an hour after their arrival, Lady Middleton had a good opinion of them.</t2055> <t2056>She declared that the two ladies were indeed charming; and for Lady Middleton, this expression indicated a warm affection.</t2056>
<t2057>Through this lively praise, Sir John gained more confidence in his judgment; so he went straight to the cottage to inform the Misses Dashwood about the visit of the Misses Steele, assuring them that these two were the most charming young ladies in the world.</t2057> <t2058>However, such praise revealed nothing; Elinor well understood that the most charming young ladies in the world could be found everywhere in England, with all sorts of shapes, faces, temperaments, and knowledge.</t2058> <t2059>Sir John wanted the whole family to go immediately to Barton Park to see the two ladies.</t2059> <t2060>A kind and benevolent man!</t2060> <t2061>He felt miserable even when keeping a third cousin to himself.</t2061>
<t2062>He said:</t2062>
<t2063>- Come right now, please come - you must come - I insist you will come.</t2063> <t2064>You can't know how much I like them.</t2064> <t2065>Lucy is incredibly beautiful, and also cheerful and pleasant!</t2065> <t2066>The children surrounded her as if she were an old acquaintance.</t2066> <t2067>Both of them are eager to meet you, because in Exeter they heard that you are the most beautiful girls in the world.</t2067> <t2068>I told them this is true, and even more.</t2068> <t2069>I'm sure you will enjoy them.</t2069> <t2070>They brought a cart full of toys for the children.</t2070> <t2071>What reason do you have to be annoyed and not come?</t2071> <t2072>You know, the two of them are your cousins, in the fashionable sense.</t2072> <t2073>You are related to me, and they are related to my wife, so all of you are related to each other.</t2073>
<t2074>But Sir John did not prevail.</t2074> <t2075>He only received their promise to come in a day or two; then he departed, puzzled by their indifferent attitude, and returned to boast about their affection for the two Miss Steeles, just as he had boasted about the affection of the two Miss Steeles for them.</t2075>
<t2076>Through the visit to Barton Park as promised and subsequently being introduced to two young women, the Dashwood sisters found in the elder, nearly thirty, a plain and insensitive appearance, nothing worth admiring.</t2076> <t2077>But in the other, no more than twenty-two or twenty-three, they recognized considerable beauty; her features were very pretty, and she had bright eyes, an elegant demeanor, though not showing refinement or grace, she still formed a unique type.</t2077> <t2078>Their manners were particularly polite, and soon Elinor found herself praising their perception, as she saw them endearing themselves to Lady Middleton through their constant and clever attentions.</t2078> <t2079>Towards Lady Middleton's children, they were always enthusiastic, praising the charms of childhood, engaging the children, and playfully teasing their whims.</t2079>
<t2080>The remaining time was for the pressing demands of courtesy, which the two ladies spent praising the Lady whenever she did anything, or asking for dress patterns of the elegant outfits the Lady had worn before, which they endlessly admired.</t2080> <t2081>Fortunate for those who wish to win favor through these weaknesses, a mother who loves her children is often the most gullible, even if she is among the most eager in seeking praise for her children.</t2081> <t2082>Her demands were excessive, but she would accept anything; thus, Lady Middleton was neither surprised nor suspicious of the Steele sisters' excessive affection and endurance towards her children.</t2082> <t2083>Through maternal indulgence, she overlooked the blatant intrusions and mischief that the two sisters had to endure.</t2083> <t2084>She saw their belts being untied, their hair being pulled around their ears, their pockets being rummaged through, their knives and forks being secretly taken, yet believed these were amusements for all parties involved.</t2084> <t2085>She found nothing surprising except for Elinor and Marianne sitting solemnly, unwilling to participate in what was happening.</t2085>
<t2086>When the boy snatched Ms. Steele's handkerchief and threw it out the window, she said:</t2086>
<t2087>- John is really hyperactive today!</t2087> <t2088>He's doing all sorts of monkey business.</t2088>
<t2089>Not long after, when the second child pinched her finger hard, she affectionately remarked:</t2089>
<t2090>- Williams seems unusually happy!</t2090>
<t2091>When affectionately caressing a three-year-old girl who had been quiet for two minutes before that, she added:</t2091>
<t2092>- And here is the gentle little Annamaria.</t2092> <t2093>This little girl is always calm and quiet - never has there been anyone as quiet as her.</t2093>
<t2094>Unfortunately, while bestowing these kisses, a pin in Lady Middleton's hair lightly scratched the child's neck; from this gentle mishap arose loud screams, no less noisy than any other creature claiming to be loud.</t2094> <t2095>The mother was extremely worried, but could not surpass the frantic attitude of the Steele sisters; and in such a tense emergency, all three did everything they could to soothe the young victim's pain.</t2095> <t2096>The mother held the little girl on her lap, covering her with kisses; one of the Steele sisters knelt on the floor, washing the wound with lavender water; the other stuffed some sugar candies into the girl's mouth.</t2096> <t2097>Through such tearful rewards, the little girl was smart enough to understand that she should continue crying.</t2097> <t2098>She kept screaming and sobbing eagerly, kicking her two brothers who wanted to touch their sister.</t2098> <t2099>All collaborative efforts to soothe her were ineffective until Lady Middleton luckily remembered that in a similar dire situation the previous week, peach jam had been effective when applied to a bruised temple.</t2099> <t2100>Thus, the peach jam remedy was eagerly suggested for this unfortunate scratch, and the girl's intermittent screams upon hearing it indicated that she did not seem to oppose the idea.</t2100> <t2101>So the girl was carried out of the room in her mother's arms to search for the remedy, and since her two brothers still wanted to follow despite their mother's pleas for them to stay, the four young ladies enjoyed a peaceful atmosphere they hadn't had for many hours.</t2101>
<t2102>As soon as they went out, Ms. Steele said:</t2102>
<t2103>- Poor children! This must be a very sad accident.</t2103>
<t2104>Marianne exclaimed:</t2104>
<t2105>- I'm not quite sure how sad it is, unless this accident is in a completely different situation.</t2105> <t2106>But this is the usual way to raise the alarm level, when in reality there is nothing alarming at all.</t2106>
<t2107>Lucy Steele said:</t2107>
<t2108>- Mrs. Middleton is such a gentlewoman!</t2108>
<t2109>Marianne was silent.</t2109> <t2110>She could not say what she did not feel, no matter how trivial the situation.</t2110> <t2111>Thus, the task of lying when politeness required it always fell to Elinor.</t2111> <t2112>Her sister tried to fulfill this duty by speaking about Lady Middleton with more enthusiasm than she felt, though still far less than Lucy did.</t2112>
<t2113>The eldest sister exclaimed:</t2113>
<t2114>- And Mr. John as well, truly a charismatic person!</t2114>
<t2115>Here too, Miss Daswood's praise, simple and fair, was given without any intention of making a splash.</t2115> <t2116>She merely wanted to remark that he was very cheerful and friendly.</t2116>
<t2117>- And what a lovely little family they have!</t2117> <t2118>I have never seen such adorable children in my life.</t2118> <t2119>I confess that I was captivated by them; indeed, I love children madly.</t2119>
<t2120>Elinor smiled:</t2120>
<t2121>- I can guess from what I witnessed this morning.</t2121>
<t2122>Lucy said:</t2122>
<t2123>- I have a feeling that you think the Middleton children are overly pampered; perhaps they are excessively indulged; that is only natural for Lady Middleton.</t2123> <t2124>As for me, I prefer to see children full of energy and excitement; I cannot stand it if they are obedient and quiet.</t2124>
<t2125>Elinor replied:</t2125>
<t2126>- To be honest, while visiting Barton Park, I never disliked well-behaved and quiet children.</t2126>
<t2127>A moment of silence followed, then Miss Steele, too eager to continue the conversation, suddenly interrupted:</t2127>
<t2128>- Miss Daswood, do you like Devonshire?</t2128> <t2129>I guess you are very sad to leave Sussex.</t2129>
<t2130>Somewhat surprised by the familiar question, or at least by the way it was asked, Elinor answered exactly that.</t2130>
<t2131>Ms. Steele added:</t2131>
<t2132>- Norland is an extraordinarily beautiful region, isn't it?</t2132>
<t2133>Lucy seemed to want to find a way to apologize for her sister's rudeness:</t2133>
<t2134>- We heard Sir John praise this land a lot.</t2134>
<t2135>Elinor replied:</t2135>
<t2136>- I think anyone who has seen this area must love it, although not everyone like us can recognize its beauties.</t2136>
<t2137>- And were there many handsome young gentlemen pursuing you there?</t2137> <t2138>I guess in this place you don't have many such people; as for where I live, I think there are always more guys.</t2138>
<t2139>Lucy showed signs of embarrassment for her older sister:</t2139>
<t2140>- But why do you think there aren't many noble young men in Devonshire like in Sussex?</t2140>
<t2141>- No, my dear, I never pretended to say there wasn't.</t2141> <t2142>I'm sure there aren't many gentlemen in Exeter; but you know, how could I say there is a handsome gentleman in Norland. I just showed you that the Dashwood girls might find Barton boring if they don't meet as many young men as before.</t2142> <t2143>But perhaps the young ladies don't care about young men, willingly living without men as peacefully as when they have them.</t2143>
<t2144>"As for me, I think most of them are likable, as long as they are well-dressed and have a polite demeanor.</t2144> <t2145>But I can't stand it when they are dirty and vulgar.</t2145> <t2146>You know, there is Mr. Rose in Exeter, a refined and handsome young man, working as a secretary for Mr. Simpson; but if you only meet him in the morning, he is not worth meeting."</t2146>
<t2147>"Miss Daswood, I guess your brother was quite the gentleman before he got married, since he was so wealthy, wasn't he?"</t2147>
<t2148>Elinor replied:</t2148>
<t2149>- To be honest, I can't tell you because I don't fully understand the meaning of the word.</t2149> <t2150>But I can say this: if he was a gentleman before getting married, he still is, because he hasn't changed in the slightest.</t2150>
<t2151>- Oh! My God!</t2151> <t2152>People never think of those who are married as gentlemen - they have to do other work.</t2152>
<t2153>My younger sister said:</t2153>
<t2154>- My goodness! Anne, you talk about nothing but young gentlemen; you will make Miss Daswood believe you think of nothing else.</t2154>
<t2155>Then, to steer the conversation in a different direction, she began to admire the house and the furniture.</t2155>
<t2156>Judging people like the two Miss Steele sisters is enough. No one praises the vulgarity and crazy ideas of the elder sister; and since Elinor is not blinded by the beauty or cleverness of the younger sister to overlook the lack of true elegance and aesthetics, she departs without wanting to know more about the two.</t2156>
<t2157>The two Steele sisters were not like that.</t2157> <t2158>They came from Exeter and were warmly praised for the way they engaged Sir John Middleton, his family, and all his connections.</t2158> <t2159>Praise was also widely bestowed upon his beautiful cousins, whom the two ladies declared to be the most beautiful, elegant, well-educated, and amiable young women they had ever met - and whom they were particularly eager to become better acquainted with.</t2159> <t2160>Thus, Elinor soon realized that it was inevitable to become more acquainted, as Sir John was entirely on the side of the two Steele sisters; the two had an unassailable position.</t2160> <t2161>So Elinor had to force herself to accept the friendship, which meant sitting together almost every day for one or two hours.</t2161>
<t2162>Mr. John couldn't do anything more, but he didn't know what more to do: in his view, being close meant meeting up.</t2162> <t2163>While the method of helping the girls continuously meet each other proved effective, he kept thinking they were surely close friends.</t2163>
<t2164>To be fair to him, he did everything within his power to encourage the Daswood ladies to be less reserved, by revealing to the Steele sisters anything he knew or guessed about his nieces' situation, along with delicate details.</t2164> <t2165>As a result, after Elinor had met them only twice, the elder Steele sister congratulated her on her younger sister's good fortune in having captivated a very polite gentleman since arriving in Barton.</t2165>
<t2166>She said:</t2166>
<t2167>- It's also a good thing that she got married at such a young age, and I hear he is quite the gentleman, extraordinarily handsome.</t2167> <t2168>And I hope that soon you will have such luck yourself, - but perhaps you already secretly have a friend somewhere.</t2168>
<t2169>Elinor knew she shouldn't expect, compared to Marianne's situation, that Sir John could be kinder when informing his suspicions about her feelings for Edward.</t2169> <t2170>Indeed, among the two subjects of jest, he preferred to joke about Elinor more, as there were more new details and more speculations.</t2170> <t2171>After Edward's visit, every time they sat down to eat together, he would raise his glass to toast her happiness with full of innuendo and many nods and winks, as if to encourage everyone to pay attention.</t2171> <t2172>The letter F - always brought up for discussion, creating countless jokes, to the point that it had long been associated with Elinor.</t2172>
<t2173>Of course, the two Steele sisters are now enjoying all this teasing.</t2173> <t2174>The elder sister is curious to know the name of the noble person being hinted at, though mentioned in a cheeky manner, it is a topic for her to delve deeper into their family matters.</t2174> <t2175>But Sir John does not want to keep teasing her curiosity, which he enjoys stirring up, because he also takes pleasure in revealing the name.</t2175>
<t2176>Through the clearly audible whisper, he said:</t2176>
<t2177>- This man has the surname Ferrars, but don't mention it because it's a secret.</t2177>
<t2178>Ms. Steele repeated:</t2178>
<t2179>- Ferrars! Mr. Ferrars is indeed happy, isn't he?</t2179> <t2180>What! Your sister-in-law's brother, Miss Daswood? Surely he is a pleasant person; I know him very well.</t2180>
<t2181>Always having to correct her sister's statements, Lucy said:</t2181>
<t2182>- Sister Anne, how could you say such a thing?</t2182> <t2183>Even though we have met him a couple of times at our uncle's house, saying that we know him very well is an exaggeration.</t2183>
<t2184>Elinor listened to everything with attention and surprise.</t2184> <t2185>"Who is this uncle? Where does he live? How did they get acquainted?" Although she did not like to participate in the conversation, she very much wanted to hear more; but no one said anything further.</t2185> <t2186>For the first time in her life, she thought Mrs. Jennings was either lacking curiosity or did not like to gossip.</t2186> <t2187>Miss Steele's manner when mentioning Edward made her even more curious; because suddenly she seemed to have a bad temper, suspecting that this lady knew - or pretended to know - something unfavorable about him.</t2187> <t2188>But her curiosity was not satisfied, as Miss Steele did not say anything more when Mr. Ferrars' name was hinted at, or even when Sir John mentioned it.</t2188>
<t2189>Chapter 22</t2189>
<t2190>Marianne would never accept flaws such as insolence, rudeness, baseness, or even differences in taste from her own.</t2190> <t2191>Especially now, she had developed an aversion that prevented her from finding any joy in the company of the Steele sisters, or from encouraging them to be more open.</t2191> <t2192>Elinor believed that she was more liked by them because her sister's inherent coldness towards them thwarted all their attempts to befriend her.</t2192> <t2193>This soon became evident to both sisters, but especially to Lucy, who never missed an opportunity to engage in conversation with her or to strengthen their bond through simple and straightforward exchanges about her feelings.</t2193>
<t2194>M</t2194>
<t2195>Lucy has a knack for cleverness; her remarks are often fair and cheerful.</t2195> <t2196>After half an hour of conversation, Elinor usually finds her likable; but her abilities are not supported by education.</t2196> <t2197>She is poorly informed and ignorant; and her lack of intellectual advancement, her deficiency in knowledge in many common areas did not escape Miss Daswood's notice, despite all efforts to appear superior.</t2197> <t2198>Elinor recognized - and pitied her for it - the lack of attention to the abilities that education could help her gain respect for.</t2198>
<t2199>But through a less affectionate perspective, Elinor also recognized the lack of subtlety, integrity, and thoughtfulness as manifested in the glances, the eagerness, and the flattery at Barton Park. She could not be long satisfied in associating with people who were both insincere and lacking in understanding, whose manner of dealing with others rendered all attentiveness and respect towards her completely worthless.</t2199>
<t2200>One day, while walking together from Barton Park to the cottage, Lucy said to her:</t2200>
<t2201>- I am sure you will find my question strange, but I would like to ask, are you acquainted with your sister-in-law's mother, Mrs. Ferrars?</t2201>
<t2202>Elinor truly thought the question was very odd.</t2202> <t2203>Her facial expression conveyed this thought as she replied that she had never met Mrs. Ferrars.</t2203>
<t2204>Lucy replied:</t2204>
<t2205>- Really!</t2205> <t2206>I wonder, because I thought you might have occasionally met her at Norland. So, perhaps you could tell me what kind of person she is?</t2206>
<t2207>Elinor was careful not to give her true opinion about Edward's mother, and did not want to satisfy what seemed to be an impolite curiosity, so she simply said:</t2207>
<t2208>- No, I don't know anything about her.</t2208>
<t2209>Lucy looked at her intently:</t2209>
<t2210>- I'm sure you think I'm really strange for asking about her in such a way, but there must be a reason - I wish I could reveal it, but I hope you'll be fair with me to believe that I have no intention of being rude.</t2210>
<t2211>Elinor replied politely, and the two continued walking in silence.</t2211>
<t2212>Lucy hesitated, then returned to the old topic:</t2212>
<t2213>- I cannot bear for you to think that I am rudely curious.</t2213> <t2214>I would rather do anything in the world than have someone whose opinion is worth listening to think of me that way.</t2214> <t2215>I certainly should not hesitate to trust you.</t2215> <t2216>Indeed, I would be very happy to hear your opinion on what to do in my difficult situation; however, there is no opportunity to trouble you.</t2216> <t2217>I regret that you do not know Mrs. Ferrars.</t2217>
<t2218>Elinor was extremely surprised:</t2218>
<t2219>- I regret that I do not know her, if this could help you understand my opinion about her.</t2219> <t2220>But honestly, I never knew you had any connection to this family, so I must admit I am somewhat surprised by such a serious question regarding her character.</t2220>
<t2221>- I assure you, you are surprised, and I do not wonder.</t2221> <t2222>But if I dared to tell you everything, you would not be so surprised.</t2222> <t2223>At the moment, Mrs. Ferrars is nothing to me - but there may come a time - when it will depend a lot on her, when we could have a very close relationship.</t2223>
<t2224>She lowered her face, adorably shy, tilting her head to observe her companion's reaction.</t2224>
<t2225>Elinor exclaimed:</t2225>
<t2226>- Good heavens! What do you mean!</t2226> <t2227>Do you have a relationship with Mr. Robert Ferrars? Is it possible?</t2227>
<t2228>And she was not pleased with the idea of having such a sister-in-law.</t2228>
<t2229>Lucy replied:</t2229>
<t2230>- No, it's not Mr. Robert Ferrars - I've never met him in my life, but (staring intently at Elinor) it's his elder brother.</t2230>
<t2231>How does Elinor feel at this moment?</t2231> <t2232>Utterly astonished, possibly in pain, if she had not immediately dismissed Lucy's confession.</t2232> <t2233>She turned to look at Lucy in amazement, unable to guess the cause or purpose of the statement; and although her expression changed, she stood still in doubt, not feeling the danger of being driven to hysteria or fainting.</t2233>
<t2234>Lucy continued:</t2234>
<t2235>- You might be very surprised, as you probably didn't know anything about this before.</t2235> <t2236>I am certain he didn't reveal anything to you or to anyone in your family because he always wanted to keep it absolutely secret, and I have kept it hidden until now.</t2236> <t2237>None of my relatives know except Anne, and I wouldn't have told you if I didn't trust that you would keep it confidential.</t2237> <t2238>Honestly, I think my attitude when asking a lot about Mrs. Ferrars might seem odd, so I need to explain.</t2238> <t2239>And I think Mr. Ferrars wouldn't be displeased to know that I trust you, because I know he has the highest regard for your family, considering you and the two Miss Dashwoods as his sisters.</t2239>
<t2240>She stopped abruptly.</t2240>
<t2241>For a moment, Elinor was silent.</t2241> <t2242>At first, she was too surprised to speak; but eventually, she was compelled to respond, and did so cautiously and calmly to conceal her surprise and concern:</t2242>
<t2243>- May I ask, have the two of you been engaged for long?</t2243>
<t2244>- We have been committed to each other for four years now.</t2244>
<t2245>- Four years!</t2245>
<t2246>- Yes.</t2246>
<t2247>Although feeling shocked, Elinor still did not want to believe:</t2247>
<t2248>- I was not informed before.</t2248>
<t2249>- However, we have known each other for many years.</t2249> <t2250>You know, he was taught by my uncle for quite a long time.</t2250>
<t2251>- Your uncle!</t2251>
<t2252>- Yes, Mr. Pratt.</t2252> <t2253>Have you heard him mention Mr. Pratt?</t2253>
<t2254>Elinor tried to suppress her rising emotions.</t2254>
<t2255>- I remember having heard it.</t2255>
<t2256>- He lived with my uncle for four years, in Longstaple, near Plymouth. The two of us started to get acquainted here, because my mother and I often visited my uncle, and the two of us got engaged here, nearly a year after he left school; but he almost always stayed with us after that.</t2256> <t2257>As you might guess, I was very hesitant to get engaged to him without his mother's knowledge and without being cautious.</t2257> <t2258>Miss Daswood, though you do not know him as well as I do, you must have known that he has qualities that make a woman earnestly love him sincerely.</t2258>
<t2259>Elinor replied:</t2259>
<t2260>- Surely so.</t2260>
<t2261>She did not know what more to say; but after a moment of reflection, through the revived belief in Edward's honor and love and the error of her companion, she said:</t2261>
<t2262>- An engagement with Mr. Edward Ferrars!</t2262> <t2263>I must confess I am completely surprised by what you say, but actually... excuse me... but there must be some mistake about the person or the name.</t2263> <t2264>We surely cannot be talking about the same Mr. Ferrars.</t2264>
<t2265>Lucy exclaimed, smiling:</t2265>
<t2266>- We cannot speak of anyone else.</t2266> <t2267>Mr. Edward Ferrars, the eldest son of Mrs. Ferrars of Park Street, is the brother of your sister-in-law, Mrs. John Dashwood, and he is the person I am referring to.</t2267> <t2268>You should think that I could not be mistaken about the name of the person who determines the happiness of my life.</t2268>
<t2269>In her most painful confusion, Elinor said:</t2269>
<t2270>- The strange thing is, I have never heard him mention even her name.</t2270>
<t2271>- Right. Given our situation, this is not surprising.</t2271> <t2272>Our primary concern is to keep the matter confidential.</t2272> <t2273>You know nothing about me, about my family, so you have no chance to hear my name.</t2273> <t2274>And when you are always afraid that your sister might suspect, that is enough reason why you did not speak out.</t2274>
<t2275>She was silent.</t2275> <t2276>Elinor's sense of reassurance was heavy, but her self-control was not.</t2276> <t2277>In a clear voice, she said:</t2277>
<t2278>- The two people have been engaged for four years.</t2278>
<t2279>- Yes; and who knows how long we will have to wait.</t2279> <t2280>Poor Edward! This matter is making him wither away!</t2280>
<t2281>Then, taking out a miniature painting from her pocket, she added:</t2281>
<t2282>- To avoid confusion, please take a look at this face.</t2282> <t2283>The painting is not as beautiful as the real person, but I think you cannot mistake the person depicted.</t2283> <t2284>I have had this painting for three years now.</t2284>
<t2285>She placed the miniature painting into Elinor's palm.</t2285> <t2286>Though she had a fleeting fear that she had decided too hastily or wished to find deception, she had no doubt that this was Edward's face.</t2286> <t2287>She handed back the miniature almost immediately, acknowledging that it was indeed him.</t2287>
<t2288>Lucy continued:</t2288>
<t2289>- I have never been able to give him my painting, and I always feel uneasy about it because he always dearly wanted to have it!</t2289> <t2290>But I am determined that as soon as I have the opportunity, I will sit for the artist to paint.</t2290>
<t2291>Elinor calmly replied:</t2291>
<t2292>- You are absolutely right.</t2292>
<t2293>Then they continued walking in silence.</t2293> <t2294>Lucy spoke first:</t2294>
<t2295>- I am sure, I trust that you will keep this secret, because you must know how important it is for us not to let his mother know about this; because I know she would not approve.</t2295> <t2296>I will have no inheritance when I get married, and I guess she is an extremely proud person.</t2296>
<t2297>Elinor said:</t2297>
<t2298>- Honestly, I don't want to delve into your personal matters, but you think I'm too important by imagining that I can help.</t2298> <t2299>I will keep your secret, but please forgive me if I show little surprise about this unnecessary exchange.</t2299> <t2300>At the very least, you should think that even if I know your affairs well, it does not harm your secret.</t2300>
<t2301>When saying this, Elinor carefully looked at Lucy, hoping to find something on her face - perhaps deceit in her words.</t2301> <t2302>But Lucy's face showed no such thing.</t2302>
<t2303>Lucy said:</t2303>
<t2304>- I was afraid you would think I was too presumptuous with you when I told you all this.</t2304> <t2305>It's true that I haven't known you for long, at least on a personal level, but I have learned about you and your entire family through stories; and as soon as I met you, I almost felt as if you were a close acquaintance.</t2305>
<t2306>"Besides this matter, I sincerely think it is necessary to explain to you clearly after inquiring about Edward's mother; and unfortunately, there is no one to advise me.</t2306> <t2307>Anne is the only one who knows about this, and she has no sense of judgment.</t2307> <t2308>In fact, she causes me more trouble than support, because I always fear she will reveal my secret.</t2308> <t2309>She doesn't know how to keep her mouth shut, as you have seen.</t2309> <t2310>One day, I was nearly scared to death when Sir John mentioned Edward's name, fearing that she would spill everything."</t2310>
<t2311>"You cannot understand what has tormented my mind.</t2311> <t2312>I am only surprised that I am still alive after the suffering I have endured over the past four years just thinking about Edward.</t2312> <t2313>Everything is in a state of suspense and uncertainty, and seeing him so rarely - we meet no more than twice a year.</t2313> <t2314>I am amazed that my heart has not yet broken."</t2314>
<t2315>She took out her handkerchief at this point, but Elinor did not feel much sympathy for her.</t2315>
<t2316>After wiping her eyes, Lucy continued:</t2316>
<t2317>- I'm not sure if it would be better for both of us to completely end our romantic relationship. (As she said this, she looked directly at her companion.) But then at other times, I don't have the resolve to do so.</t2317> <t2318>I can't bear the thought of making him suffer, because I know just saying that would make him suffer.</t2318> <t2319>And that's also because of me - because to me, he is everything - I think I don't have the strength to endure if we end the relationship. Miss Daswood, in this situation, what would you advise me to do?</t2319> <t2320>If you were me, what would you do?</t2320>
<t2321>Surprised by the question, Elinor said:</t2321>
<t2322>- I'm sorry, but I can't advise you in a situation like this.</t2322> <t2323>It's up to you to consider.</t2323>
<t2324>For a few minutes, both were silent, then Lucy continued:</t2324>
<t2325>- Surely one day his mother will support him, but poor Edward was disappointed by this!</t2325> <t2326>Do you think he was terribly disheartened at Barton?</t2326> <t2327>He was so miserable when he left us at Longstaple to visit you, that I fear you might think he was unwell.</t2327>
<t2328>- So, he went from your uncle's house and then visited us, right?</t2328>
<t2329>- Ah, right.</t2329> <t2330>He stayed at our house for half a month.</t2330> <t2331>Do you think he came straight here from the city?</t2331>
<t2332>Elinor was sensitive to every new situation that confirmed Lucy's honesty.</t2332> <t2333>She replied:</t2333>
<t2334>- No, I remember he told me that he had stayed near Plymouth with some of his friends.</t2334>
<t2335>She also remembers that at that time she was surprised because he did not say anything more about these friends, because he was completely silent even regarding their names.</t2335>
<t2336>Lucy repeated:</t2336>
<t2337>- Do you think he is discouraged?</t2337>
<t2338>- It's true that we thought that way when you first arrived.</t2338>
<t2339>- I begged him to keep his spirits up lest she suspect something; but this matter made him so distressed that he couldn't stay with us for more than half a month, seeing how heavily it affected me.</t2339> <t2340>Poor fellow!</t2340> <t2341>I fear he is still the same now, as he wrote to me in a state of distress.</t2341> <t2342>I received news of him just before I left Exeter.</t2342>
<t2343>She pulled out a letter from her pocket, showing it to Elinor haphazardly:</t2343>
<t2344>- I think you recognize his handwriting, it's really nice; but this letter is not as well-written as usual.</t2344> <t2345>I think he is tired, because he just wrote to fill the page.</t2345>
<t2346>Elinor saw that this was indeed his handwriting, and she no longer doubted.</t2346> <t2347>The painting, she allowed herself to believe, might have been there by chance rather than as a keepsake from Edward; but a letter could only be by appointment, it could not be for any other reason.</t2347> <t2348>For a moment, she almost lost her composure - her heart grew heavy and she nearly couldn't stand.</t2348> <t2349>But it was absolutely necessary to compose herself, and she resolutely fought against her thoughts from collapsing, so she recovered her spirits fairly quickly.</t2349>
<t2350>Lucy put the letter back into her pocket.</t2350>
<t2351>- During these long periods of separation, writing letters to each other is our only solace.</t2351> <t2352>Yes, I have another comfort in your portrait, but poor Edward does not have that.</t2352> <t2353>He says he would be at peace with just a portrait of me.</t2353> <t2354>I gave him a lock of hair set in a ring when he came to Longstaple last time; and he said it was some comfort to him, but not as much as a portrait.</t2354> <t2355>Perhaps you noticed the ring when you met him, didn't you?</t2355>
<t2356>- I saw it.</t2356>
<t2357>She tried to keep her voice calm, but beneath the calm exterior was an undercurrent of emotion and pain more intense than anything she had ever experienced.</t2357> <t2358>She was stunned, shocked, and confused.</t2358>
<t2359>Fortunately for her, they had now returned to the inn, and the conversation could not go any further.</t2359> <t2360>After sitting with them for a few minutes, Miss Steele returned to Barton Park, and Elinor was left alone to reflect and suffer.</t2360>
<t2361>Chapter 23</t2361>
<t2362>Although Elinor did not quite believe Lucy's words, after serious contemplation, she found it impossible to doubt, as she could not explain the madness if it were fabricated.</t2362> <t2363>Therefore, Elinor could not doubt and no longer dared to doubt what Lucy recounted; especially since there was evidence for each situation that no one could deny except her own desire to deny it.</t2363> <t2364>The opportunity for the two to meet at Mr. Pratt's house was the origin of subsequent events, which could not be denied and was a worrying situation.</t2364> <t2365>Then there was Edward's visit near Plymouth, his melancholic state, dissatisfaction with his own future, his indecisive attitude towards her, and the Steele sisters' intimate knowledge of Norland and their family connections, which often surprised her.</t2365> <t2366>Then there was the miniature portrait, the letter, the ring, all evidence that helped overcome any hesitation to unjustly condemn him, and confirmed a fact - which fairness could not dismiss - showing that he had treated her poorly.</t2366>
<t2367>T</t2367>
<t2368>In a short time, she only felt for herself: resentment for such behavior, indignation for being deceived.</t2368> <t2369>Soon, other thoughts and considerations arose.</t2369> <t2370>Did Edward intentionally deceive her?</t2370> <t2371>Did he fake feelings for her that he did not feel?</t2371> <t2372>Did he promise himself to Lucy from the heart?</t2372> <t2373>No; at present, she could not believe it, regardless of what had happened in the past.</t2373> <t2374>His feelings were all for her.</t2374> <t2375>She could not be deceived about this.</t2375> <t2376>Her mother, her two sisters, Fanny, all had recognized his affection for her while at Norland; this was not an illusion born of vanity.</t2376>
<t2377>Surely he loves her.</t2377> <t2378>How serene it is in the soul to cherish such a belief! And it makes it easier for her to forgive him! He is to blame, very much to blame, for staying at Norland after the first time he felt her influence on him was stronger than usual.</t2378>
<t2379>In fact, you cannot be excused; but if you hurt her, how much more hurt will you be?</t2379> <t2380>If her situation is pitiful, yours is desperate!</t2380> <t2381>Your lack of caution caused her suffering for a time, but it seems to have deprived you of every opportunity for a different life.</t2381> <t2382>She will eventually find peace again; but as for you, what do you hope for? Can you be happy, even relatively, with Lucy Steele? Even if you do not love her, with your sense of integrity, delicate manners, and understanding mind, can you be satisfied with a wife like her - ignorant, cunning, and selfish?</t2382>
<t2383>Nineteen-year-old impulsiveness naturally made him blind to everything except beauty and innocence; but the next four years - years that should have brought more knowledge if lived wisely - should have helped him open his eyes to the deficiencies in her education.</t2383> <t2384>As for her, that same period was spent on lowly associations and aimless pursuits, which perhaps had taken away the simplicity that once contributed to her beauty.</t2384>
<t2385>If the promotion of marriage with her seems difficult from the mother's side, how much greater will the difficulty be when compared to her, his object of affection is certainly inferior in family background, perhaps also inferior in wealth! In fact, with a heart that has distanced itself from Lucy, the difficulties may not exert pressure but rather foster patience; yet he remains melancholic, hoping for family opposition and cruelty so that he may feel relieved!</t2385>
<t2386>These thoughts sequentially passed through her mind in anguish.</t2386> <t2387>She cried for him more than for herself.</t2387> <t2388>After the initial shock, she believed she had done nothing to deserve such suffering, consoling herself that Edward had done nothing to lose her esteem, so she thought she should restrain herself so that her mother and two sisters would not suspect anything.</t2388> <t2389>She could meet her own expectations so satisfactorily that when she sat down with them at the table just two hours after she had been in torment because all hope had vanished, no one could tell from the outward appearance of the two sisters that Elinor was silently mourning the eternal obstacles separating her from the man she loved; and that Marianne was dreaming of the perfections of a young man whose heart she believed she had wholly won, and whom she expected to see in every carriage that passed by their house.</t2389>
<t2390>Even though she had to conceal from her mother and Marianne the secret she had been trusted to hear, Elinor did not suffer further.</t2390> <t2391>On the contrary, she felt relieved because she did not have to break the news that would sadden them, nor did she have to listen to the condemnation of Edward that would pour out from their exaggerated affection for her, making it difficult for her to defend him.</t2391>
<t2392>She knew that the two people could not support her through advice or conversation.</t2392> <t2393>Their love and sorrow would only make her more miserable, while they would neither encourage nor praise her self-restraint.</t2393> <t2394>Through the bitter and still fresh regrets, she grew stronger alone; and her sound judgment positively supported her, so much so that her firmness was steadfast, and her outward cheerfulness was maintained.</t2394>
<t2395>Although she was distressed by the first conversation with Lucy, she soon eagerly wanted to exchange more, for many reasons.</t2395> <t2396>She wanted to hear again the details of the engagement between the two, she wanted to understand more clearly Lucy's true feelings for Edward, and whether she was sincere when expressing her feelings for him.</t2396> <t2397>Especially, through further conversation and keeping calm while talking, she wanted to convince Lucy that she was not interested in anything other than in the capacity of a friend.</t2397> <t2398>She feared that when she was emotional in the morning, her friend at least had doubts.</t2398> <t2399>It was very likely that Lucy was easily jealous of her: it was clear that Edward always praised her, and this was not only confirmed by Lucy, but also because shortly after getting to know each other, she had trusted her enough to reveal an important secret.</t2399>
<t2400>And even the news spread through Sir John's jesting carried some weight.</t2400> <t2401>Indeed, while Elinor remained firmly convinced in her heart that Edward truly loved her, it was natural for Lucy to be jealous; and if that was the case, her confidence was evidence.</t2401> <t2402>What other reason could justify her revelation, except to inform Elinor that Lucy had completely captured Edward's affections, and that she should avoid him in the future?</t2402> <t2403>Therefore, it was not difficult for her to understand the intentions of her rival.</t2403>
<t2404>While she was determined to act according to the principles of honor and fidelity, resisting her personal feelings for Edward and meeting him as little as possible; she still wanted to persuade Lucy that her heart was not hurt.</t2404> <t2405>And since now there was nothing more painful to hear about the matter than what had already been heard, she did not doubt her ability to remain calm while recounting the details.</t2405>
<t2406>But at the moment she couldn't create such an opportunity, even though Lucy was as ready as she was to take advantage of it, because the weather didn't allow them to walk together in places where they could easily avoid others.</t2406> <t2407>Although the two met every other day, usually at the cottage but sometimes at Barton Park, they couldn't have private conversations.</t2407> <t2408>Sir John or Lady Middleton didn't notice such intentions, so they didn't create opportunities for them to talk, especially to talk in private.</t2408> <t2409>The two ladies only met to eat and laugh together, play cards, or participate in some noisy game.</t2409>
<t2410>After one or two such meetings were organized without giving Elinor any privacy with Lucy, Sir John visited the cottage one morning to compassionately invite the ladies to dine with Lady Middleton because he was busy attending the club in Exeter and she would be quite lonely with only her mother and the two Steele sisters.</t2410> <t2411>Elinor anticipated an opportunity for her existing purpose, feeling more at ease with the less talkative and more genteel Lady Middleton than her husband who enjoyed gathering them in noisy company, so she immediately accepted the invitation.</t2411> <t2412>Margaret also accepted, with her mother's approval. As for Marianne, though she was not keen on joining, she was persuaded by her mother, who could not bear to see her seclude herself from all social activities, so she went as well.</t2412>
<t2413>The three girls arrived, and Mrs. Middleton was delighted to escape the dreadful solitude that had threatened her.</t2413> <t2414>The meeting was as dull as Elinor had anticipated, with no new thoughts or statements, nothing more tedious than the speeches that dragged on from the dining room to the family room where the children joined in, and while everyone was there, she couldn't manage to talk to Lucy.</t2414> <t2415>The children only left when it was time to clear the table for tea.</t2415> <t2416>They set up the card table, and Elinor began to wonder how she could find time to converse.</t2416> <t2417>They all stood up to prepare for the card game.</t2417>
<t2418>Mrs. Middleton said to Lucy:</t2418>
<t2419>- I am glad to see that you do not intend to finish poor Annamaria's basket tonight; because I know your eyes will get tired working with gold and silver patterns by candlelight.</t2419> <t2420>We will find a way to make up for the girl's disappointment tomorrow, and I hope the little one will not be upset.</t2420>
<t2421>That hint is enough. Lucy immediately remembered and said:</t2421>
<t2422>- Mrs. Middleton, actually you have misunderstood.</t2422> <t2423>I was just waiting to see if you could gather enough cards without me, if so I could work on the gold and silver patterns.</t2423> <t2424>I don't want the little angel to be disappointed, and if you need me to play cards, I intended to finish the basket after the snack.</t2424>
<t2425>- You are very kind, I hope you won't get eye strain - could you please ring the bell to ask for a few candles so we can work?</t2425> <t2426>I know my poor girl will be terribly disappointed if the basket is not finished by tomorrow, because although I told her she couldn't finish it, I know for sure she is hoping to get it done.</t2426>
<t2427>Lucy herself pulled the table closer, sat down with a brisk and cheerful manner, as if to show that nothing was more enjoyable than helping a naughty child make a basket with gold and silver patterns.</t2427>
<t2428>Mrs. Middleton suggested they play a type of casino card game.</t2428> <t2429>No one objected, but Marianne, with her usual lack of decorum, exclaimed:</t2429>
<t2430>- Please, Madam, allow me to sit out - you know I hate playing cards.</t2430> <t2431>I will play the zither; I haven't played since the strings were last tuned.</t2431>
<t2432>And without any further ceremony, she turned and walked to the piano.</t2432>
<t2433>Mrs. Middleton appeared as if she was thankful that she had never spoken so rudely.</t2433>
<t2434>Trying to soothe the offense, Elinor said:</t2434>
<t2435>- You know, madam, Marianne cannot be away from this piano for long, and I am not surprised, because this is the best-sounding piano I have ever heard.</t2435>
<t2436>There are five people left at the card table.</t2436>
<t2437>Elinor continued:</t2437>
<t2438>- If I can be spared, I can help roll the paper for Miss Lucy Steele. There is still so much work to be done on the basket that I don't think she can finish it tonight.</t2438> <t2439>I want to help quickly, if she allows me to work with her.</t2439>
<t2440>Lucy exclaimed:</t2440>
<t2441>- Actually, I want you to help, because I see there are more things to do than I initially thought; and it would be shocking if we disappoint dear little Annamaria.</t2441>
<t2442>Ms. Steele said:</t2442>
<t2443>- Oh! That's really bad.</t2443> <t2444>I feel so sorry for the little girl!</t2444>
<t2445>Mrs. Middleton said to Elinor:</t2445>
<t2446>- You are really kind, and since you genuinely like this job, maybe you will wait until the next fair, or do you want to try your luck now?</t2446>
<t2447>Elinor gladly seized the first opportunity, and thus, through a bit of skillful conversation that Marianne never employed, she achieved her goal, while simultaneously pleasing Lady Middleton.</t2447> <t2448>Lucy carefully arranged a place for her to sit, and thus the two charming rivals sat next to each other, in utmost harmony, helping each other with a task.</t2448> <t2449>Marianne was absorbed in her music and her own thoughts, completely forgetting the presence of others in the room.</t2449> <t2450>Fortunately, the piano was placed near the two, so now Miss Dashwood felt safe within the wall of sound to start a conversation without worrying about the card table eavesdropping.</t2450>
<t2451>Chapter 24</t2451>
<t2452>Elinor began in a voice that was steady yet cautious:</t2452>
<t2453>E</t2453>
<t2454>- I would not be worthy of the trust you have placed in me if I did not earnestly continue the conversation or had no further curiosity about the matter.</t2454> <t2455>Therefore, I will not apologize for wanting to start a conversation again.</t2455>
<t2456>Warm Lucy:</t2456>
<t2457>- Thank you for alleviating all my apprehensions, thus helping my mind feel at ease, because for some reason I was afraid that I had offended you with what I told you last Monday.</t2457>
<t2458>Elinor spoke with the utmost sincerity:</t2458>
<t2459>- Insult me! How could you insult me?</t2459> <t2460>Believe me, I never had this thought about you.</t2460> <t2461>Didn't you have a motive to trust, making me feel honored and self-satisfied?</t2461>
<t2462>Lucy’s sharp eyes were full of meaning as she replied:</t2462>
<t2463>- However, I assure you, it seems to me that you have been distant and displeased, which makes me uneasy.</t2463> <t2464>I thought you were angry with me, and since then I have been tormenting myself for having bothered you with my personal matters.</t2464> <t2465>But I am very happy to see that this was only my imagination and that you truly do not blame me.</t2465> <t2466>If you knew how much comfort I felt when I opened my heart to talk to you about what I always think about every moment of my life, then I believe your understanding would help you overlook everything else.</t2466>
<t2467>- Indeed, I can easily believe that you will feel much relieved when you present your situation to me, and please trust that you will never have any reason to regret having done this.</t2467> <t2468>Your case is truly unfortunate: it seems to me that you are surrounded by many difficulties, and you will need all the mutual sympathy to support you.</t2468> <t2469>I believe that Mr. Ferrars is completely dependent on his mother.</t2469>
<t2470>- He only has two thousand pounds of his own.</t2470> <t2471>Marrying with such an asset is madness, although for my part, I could easily throw away more than that without lamenting. I am used to living on a very small income, and for him, I could manage in any poverty; but because I love him very much, I do not want to be selfish and let him be deprived of everything his mother would have given him if he married according to her wishes.</t2471> <t2472>We have to wait, possibly for many years.</t2472> <t2473>For most other men in the world, this might be a daunting prospect; but I know I still have Edward's steadfast affection.</t2473>
<t2474>- This belief must mean everything to her, and surely he is also supported by the same belief in her.</t2474> <t2475>If the strength of their mutual feelings were to weaken, as has happened with many others and in many cases of engagements lasting four years, her situation would be truly pitiable.</t2475>
<t2476>Lucy looked up, but Elinor carefully kept her expression unchanged to make her words seem suspicious.</t2476>
<t2477>Lucy said:</t2477>
<t2478>- Edward's love for me has been tested through our long, very long separation since we first made our vow; so if I still had any doubts now, it would be unforgivable.</t2478> <t2479>I can confidently say that he has never caused me a moment of worry.</t2479>
<t2480>Elinor did not know whether to smile or sigh at this assertion.</t2480>
<t2481>Lucy continued:</t2481>
<t2482>- By nature, I am often jealous; and due to the difficult circumstances in our lives, due to your much higher social standing than mine, and due to our frequent separations, I also have a tendency to be suspicious and want to find out the truth immediately if, when we meet, you show any slight change in behavior, or display a drop in spirits without a justifiable reason, or if you talk about a girl in a more special way compared to others, or no longer feel as happy as you did in Longstaple before.</t2482> <t2483>I do not mean to say that I am often spying or particularly observant, but in such cases, I am confident that I cannot be deceived.</t2483>
<t2484>Elinor thought: "All this is very interesting! But it cannot be imposed on either of us." After a moment of silence, she said:</t2484>
<t2485>- But what are your intentions?</t2485> <t2486>Or do nothing and just wait until Mrs. Ferrars passes away, which is a sad and shocking last resort?</t2486> <t2487>Will her son be determined to endure this, endure many years of dullness and suspense that also involve you, rather than risk displeasing his mother for a while by knowing the truth?</t2487>
<t2488>- If we knew for sure it was only a matter of time!</t2488> <t2489>But Mrs. Ferrars is a very proud and determined woman; and in the initial anger upon hearing the truth, she could transfer all the inheritance to Robert.</t2489> <t2490>Out of concern for Edward, this idea terrifies me to the point of not daring to take any hasty action.</t2490>
<t2491>- And also because of you, because you do not have an unreasonable tendency for self-interest.</t2491>
<t2492>Lucy looked over at Elinor again, and remained silent.</t2492>
<t2493>Elinor asked:</t2493>
<t2494>- Do you know Mr. Robert Ferrars?</t2494>
<t2495>- I don't know him at all.</t2495> <t2496>I have never met him, but I imagine he is nothing like his brother - foolish and a true dandy.</t2496>
<t2497>Miss Steele caught these words amidst the interruptions in Marianne's playing.</t2497> <t2498>She repeated:</t2498>
<t2499>- A genuine dandy! Ah, you two are talking about the man of their dreams, I knew it.</t2499>
<t2500>Lucy exclaimed:</t2500>
<t2501>- No, sister, you are mistaken here, the dream boys we have are not spoiled brats.</t2501>
<t2502>Mrs. Jennings laughed heartily:</t2502>
<t2503>- I can answer that Miss Daswood's young man is not like that, because he is one of the most modest and handsome young men I have ever met; as for Lucy, that little girl is so cunning, it's impossible to know which man she likes.</t2503>
<t2504>Ms. Steele exclaimed, looking at the two with a meaningful glance:</t2504>
<t2505>- Oh, I'm sure Lucy's boy is also modest and handsome, but not as much as Miss Daswood's.</t2505>
<t2506>Elinor blushed but couldn't maintain her composure.</t2506> <t2507>Meanwhile, Lucy bit her lip angrily and looked past her sister.</t2507> <t2508>There was a moment of silence, then Lucy lowered her voice even though Marianne was providing them with a secure cover through a splendid concerto:</t2508>
<t2509>- I will honestly tell you a plan that I finally came up with to resolve the matter.</t2509> <t2510>In fact, I intended to let you know this secret because you are involved.</t2510> <t2511>I know you have often met Edward, so you must be aware that he prefers working with the church over other professions.</t2511> <t2512>Now, my plan is for him to be ordained as soon as possible, and then I know because you are willing to help him out of friendship and also hope you care for me, you could use your influence to persuade your brother to let Edward manage the Norland parish.</t2512> <t2513>I think this position will provide a decent income, and the current incumbent probably won't live much longer.</t2513> <t2514>This will be enough for us to rely on to get married, and then we will wait for the rest depending on time and circumstances.</t2514>
<t2515>Elinor replied:</t2515>
<t2516>- I am always happy to show my respect and friendship for Mr. Ferrars, but don't you see that my influence in this matter would be entirely unnecessary?</t2516> <t2517>He is the brother of Mrs. John Dashwood - that is enough to recommend him to her husband.</t2517>
<t2518>- But Miss John Daswood will not approve of Edward joining the clergy.</t2518>
<t2519>- Then I think my influence won't help much.</t2519>
<t2520>The two people were silent for a few minutes.</t2520> <t2521>Finally, Lucy sighed:</t2521>
<t2522>- I believe the wisest course of action is to immediately end this situation by severing our relationship.</t2522> <t2523>We seem to be troubled by difficulties from each side, so much so that although this decision will cause us pain for a while, ultimately we will be happier.</t2523> <t2524>But, Miss Daswood, could you give me some advice?</t2524>
<t2525>Elinor smiled, thereby concealing her very turbulent emotions.</t2525>
<t2526>- No, regarding matters like this, I definitely will not give advice.</t2526> <t2527>You know very well that my opinion will have no weight with you, except when I speak according to your wishes.</t2527>
<t2528>With a very serious expression, Lucy said:</t2528>
<t2529>- Actually, you have misunderstood.</t2529> <t2530>I don't know anyone else whose sound judgment I value as highly as yours; and I truly believe that if you said, "I advise you to find every way to end the relationship with Edward Ferrars for the happiness of both of you," I would definitely follow it immediately.</t2530>
<t2531>Blushing because Edward's future wife had been dishonest, Elinor replied:</t2531>
<t2532>- This compliment actually makes me afraid to voice any opinion, even though I already have one in mind.</t2532> <t2533>You have elevated my influence too high.</t2533> <t2534>Separating two people who are deeply attached to each other is too much for an outsider.</t2534>
<t2535>With a touch of sulkiness, emphasizing each word, Lucy said:</t2535>
<t2536>- That's just because you are an indifferent person, and furthermore: - your judgment carries weight with me.</t2536> <t2537>If you were biased by your own feelings, then your opinion would not be worth listening to.</t2537>
<t2538>Elinor thought it best not to reply, lest the two might provoke each other by becoming too comfortable and improperly open.</t2538> <t2539>She was also determined never to bring up this matter again.</t2539> <t2540>They both fell into silence for several minutes, and it was Lucy who spoke first again.</t2540> <t2541>She spoke with her usual air of self-satisfaction:</t2541>
<t2542>- Miss Daswood, will you go to the city this winter?</t2542>
<t2543>- Certainly not.</t2543>
<t2544>Her eyes lit up:</t2544>
<t2545>- I'm sorry; I would be very happy to see you there again.</t2545> <t2546>But I think even if I say that, you will go.</t2546> <t2547>Surely your brother and sister will invite you to go with them.</t2547>
<t2548>- If that's the case, I also do not have the right to accept their invitation.</t2548>
<t2549>- What a pity!</t2549> <t2550>I had believed I would meet you there.</t2550> <t2551>At the end of January, Anne and I will visit some relatives because they have been hoping for us to come for years! But I only want to meet Edward.</t2551> <t2552>He will be there in February, otherwise, I don't find London enjoyable at all.</t2552> <t2553>I am not excited about this city.</t2553>
<t2554>Before long, Elinor was called to join the next card party, and thus their private conversation had to end without hesitation, as each still harbored the same resentment towards the other as before.</t2554> <t2555>Elinor sat down at the card table with the melancholy realization that not only did Edward not love the woman who would become his wife, but he also had no chance of even relative happiness in marriage, despite her genuine affection for him.</t2555> <t2556>It was purely out of selfishness that a woman wanted to keep a man in an engagement, even though she seemed to understand very well that he was no longer interested.</t2556>
<t2557>From this moment on, Elinor never mentioned the matter again.</t2557> <t2558>As for Lucy, she rarely missed an opportunity to bring it up, especially when she happily announced receiving a letter from Edward.</t2558> <t2559>Elinor only responded with a calm and cautious demeanor, and politely avoided the topic, as she felt such conversations were an unnecessary indulgence for the other woman, and not beneficial for herself.</t2559>
<t2560>The visit of the two Steele sisters to Barton Park lasted longer than the time implied in the initial invitation.</t2560> <t2561>The two were beloved; the hosts needed them. Sir John did not want to hear about their departure; and despite having many pre-arranged commitments in Exeter, despite the urgent necessity to return each week, the two were earnestly requested to stay for nearly two months, and to assist with an upcoming festival that required many gatherings and grand feasts to showcase its importance.</t2561>
<t2562>Chapter 25</t2562>
<t2563>Although Mrs. Jennings had the habit of spending most of the year at the homes of her children and friends, she still had a stable residence of her own.</t2563> <t2564>Since the death of her husband, who had been successful in business in a less elegant part of the city, she stayed in a house in Portman Square every winter. As January approached, her thoughts turned to returning to this house, and thus one day - very suddenly and without any preamble - she invited the two elder Miss Dashwoods to accompany her.</t2564>
<t2565>M</t2565>
<t2566>Elinor did not notice her sister's flushed face and the lively expression that indicated excitement. She immediately refused for both of them in a tactful but firm manner, as she believed she was speaking on behalf of them both.</t2566> <t2567>She cited the reason that she could not leave their mother at this time of year.</t2567>
<t2568>Mrs. Jennings was somewhat surprised and immediately reiterated the invitation:</t2568>
<t2569>- Oh, my God! I am certain that your mother can be away from you without any issues, and I want to implore you both to grant me the favor of accompanying me, for my mind is made up.</t2569> <t2570>Do not imagine that you will inconvenience me at all, for I will let you be free and at ease.</t2570> <t2571>We just need to send Betty by stagecoach, and I hope I have enough money to cover this.</t2571> <t2572>The three of us will travel comfortably in my carriage; and when we arrive in the city, if there is any place you do not wish to accompany me, it is fine, you can always go with one of my two daughters.</t2572>
<t2573>"I am sure your mother will not object; because I have been fortunate enough to marry off both my daughters, so she will think I am a suitable guardian for you; and if I cannot help you have a good marriage after I have done my part, it will not be my fault.</t2573> <t2574>I will speak well of you to every young man; you can trust me."</t2574>
<t2575>Mr. John said:</t2575>
<t2576>- I have the opinion that Miss Marianne would not oppose such a plan if her sister also went along.</t2576> <t2577>It would indeed be unfair if she did not have a bit of enjoyment just because Miss Daswood did not want to.</t2577> <t2578>So I advise you and your sister to head to the city when you feel bored of Barton, without needing to say anything to Miss Daswood.</t2578>
<t2579>Mrs. Jennings exclaimed:</t2579>
<t2580>- Agreed.</t2580> <t2581>I would be immensely happy if Miss Marianne could come along regardless of whether Miss Daswood goes or not, it's just that the more the merrier, and I think it would be more convenient to have both sisters; because if they get bored of me, they can talk to each other and laugh behind my back about my old-fashioned ways.</t2581> <t2582>But I must have one of the two, if not both.</t2582> <t2583>Thank heavens! Imagine how I could live alone: I was used to having Charlotte by my side until this winter.</t2583> <t2584>Now, Miss Marianne, shake hands to agree, and if Miss Daswood gradually changes her mind, all the better.</t2584>
<t2585>Marianne warmly said:</t2585>
<t2586>- I sincerely thank you, truly thank you; your invitation makes me forever grateful and gives me joy - yes, almost the greatest joy I could receive.</t2586> <t2587>But my mother - the dearest and kindest mother - I see that Elinor is right, and if our mother has to be sad and troubled because we are away...</t2587> <t2588>Oh! No, nothing could entice me away from her.</t2588> <t2589>There should be no struggle here.</t2589>
<t2590>Mrs. Jennings reassured that Mrs. Dashwood could let the two girls go without any consequences.</t2590>
<t2591>Elinor now understood her sister's intention, realizing that beyond the indifferent appearance was an eagerness to meet Willoughby again. Therefore, she no longer refused to follow the plan but instead suggested waiting for their mother's decision, though she did not expect her mother to support her in declining the trip, which she herself could not agree to on Marianne's behalf. Elinor also had her own reasons to avoid the trip.</t2591> <t2592>Whenever Marianne wanted something, their mother was always eager to support her—Elinor did not expect to influence her mother regarding caution in matters of the heart because she could never convey her doubts to her; and she did not dare to explain the motives behind her refusal to go to London.</t2592>
<t2593>As for Marianne, although she was difficult to please and had long been accustomed to Mrs. Jennings' ways, which she often despised, she now ignored all the troubles caused by Mrs. Jennings and disregarded anything that might hurt her sister while pursuing her own goals.</t2593> <t2594>This was clear evidence that she considered this goal extremely important.</t2594> <t2595>Despite everything that had happened, Elinor still could not mentally prepare herself to cope.</t2595>
<t2596>When informed about the invitation, Mrs. Daswood believed that her two daughters would have an enjoyable time and, through her deep concern, clearly saw how much Marianne's heart was set on the trip.</t2596> <t2597>Thus, she did not want to hear her two daughters refuse by citing reasons concerning her, insisting that they should accept the invitation; and then, through her inherent joy, she began to envision several benefits for her daughters from this separation.</t2597> <t2598>She exclaimed:</t2598>
<t2599>- Mom really likes this plan, just as she hoped.</t2599> <t2600>Margaret and Mom will be as comfortable as you two.</t2600> <t2601>When you two and the Middletons have gone, the two of us at home will have a peaceful time, enjoying books and music together!</t2601> <t2602>When you two return, you will see that Margaret is a completely different person! Mom also has a small plan to renovate your bedroom, which can now proceed without disturbing anyone.</t2602> <t2603>It is truly right that you two should go to the city; Mom wants every daughter at this age to get acquainted with the manners and pleasures of London.</t2603> <t2604>And by all means, you should meet your brother, regardless of any faults he or his wife may have, when Mom considers who his father is, she cannot bear for you to be estranged from each other.</t2604>
<t2605>Elinor said:</t2605>
<t2606>- Even though, with constant worry for the happiness of her children, mother had removed all the obstacles caused by this trip for her, there was still one obstacle that I thought could not be easily overcome.</t2606>
<t2607>Marianne's face darkened:</t2607>
<t2608>Mrs. Daswood asked:</t2608>
<t2609>- What does my careful and dear Elinor mean?</t2609> <t2610>What terrible obstacle is my daughter planning to bring?</t2610> <t2611>Tell me the cost of this.</t2611>
<t2612>- My point is, although I clearly recognize Mrs. Jennings' kindness, she does not belong to the class suitable for us to associate with, nor can she protect us from the consequences.</t2612>
<t2613>The mother replied:</t2613>
<t2614>- You are very right, but regarding her class, which is different from others, you will not associate much with them, and you two will almost always appear in public together with Lady Middleton.</t2614>
<t2615>Marianne said:</t2615>
<t2616>- If Elinor is reluctant because she has an aversion to Mrs. Jennings, at least this should not prevent you from accepting her invitation.</t2616> <t2617>You are not so particular, and I am sure you can easily endure any inconvenience.</t2617>
<t2618>Elinor couldn't suppress a smile at the indifferent expression towards the manners of a person whom she still found it difficult to persuade Marianne to behave with polite endurance.</t2618> <t2619>She decided that if her sister was determined to go, she would go as well.</t2619> <t2620>She thought it would be improper to let Marianne's immature judgment lead her sister, or for Mrs. Jennings to leave Marianne out to enjoy herself so that she could be comfortable in her own home.</t2620> <t2621>She found it easier to accept this intention when she recalled that Lucy had told her Edward Ferrars would not come to town before February; and that their trip could end before he arrived without having to shorten the time much.</t2621>
<t2622>Mrs. Daswood said:</t2622>
<t2623>- Mother wants both of you to go, there is no reason to refuse.</t2623> <t2624>You will have a lot of fun in London, especially when you go together; and if Elinor ever condescends to prepare for amusement, you will be able to go to many places; you can also strengthen the relationship with your sister-in-law's family.</t2624>
<t2625>Elinor had often hoped for an opportunity for her mother to realize not to hope for any feelings between Edward and her, so she would not be too shocked when the whole truth was revealed.</t2625> <t2626>Now, though almost in despair, she tried to remain calm:</t2626>
<t2627>- I am very fond of Edward Ferrars and always happy to see him; but as for the other members of his family, I am completely indifferent, whether I have known them before or not.</t2627>
<t2628>Mrs. Daswood just smiled without saying anything.</t2628> <t2629>Marianne raised her eyebrows in surprise, while Elinor gestured for her sister to mind her words.</t2629>
<t2630>After conversing a bit more, they finally agreed that they should wholeheartedly accept the invitation.</t2630> <t2631>Mrs. Jennings was overjoyed upon hearing the news, with many reassurances that the two ladies would be well taken care of; and this joy was not hers alone. Sir John was also pleased; for a man who is always restless when there are few people around, having two more residents in London was something special.</t2631> <t2632>Even Lady Middleton made an effort to appear pleased, contrary to her usual disposition.</t2632> <t2633>As for the Steele sisters, especially Lucy, they had never been so happy upon hearing the news.</t2633>
<t2634>Elinor accepted every arrangement contrary to her wishes with less reluctance than she initially thought.</t2634> <t2635>As for her, there was now no question of going to the city.</t2635> <t2636>Seeing her mother completely satisfied with the plan and her sister delighted, as evidenced by her expression, voice, and gestures returning to their usual liveliness and even exceeding normal delight, she no longer resented the cause and did not want to allow herself to doubt the outcome.</t2636>
<t2637>Marianne's joy was almost beyond happiness, as immense as the turmoil in her mind and the restlessness of setting off.</t2637> <t2638>She only calmed down when she lingered with her mother, and at the moment of parting, her sorrow became excessive.</t2638> <t2639>Her mother's sorrow was not necessarily less, while Elinor was the only one among the three who did not view the separation as a permanent farewell.</t2639>
<t2640>They set off in the first week of January.</t2640> <t2641>The Middleton family will follow about a week later.</t2641> <t2642>The Steele sisters stayed at Barton Park and only departed with the rest of the family.</t2642>
<t2643>Chapter 26</t2643>
<t2644>When starting the journey under the care of Mrs. Jennings, who was also her host, sharing the carriage with her, Elinor thought about herself and was surprised at her current situation: having known her for only a short time, completely mismatched in age and temperament, and having opposed this plan so much just a few days ago!</t2644> <t2645>But through the exuberance in the happiness of youth that Marianne and their mother shared, these objections had been overshadowed or ignored.</t2645> <t2646>Although sometimes doubting Willoughby's fidelity, Elinor witnessed the outburst of longing filling Marianne's soul and radiating in her eyes, and felt that compared to her sister, her own prospects were empty, her own mood was insipid.</t2646> <t2647>She wished to be in Marianne's situation to have the same lively purpose ahead, cherishing the same possible hope.</t2647>
<t2648>K</t2648>
<t2649>However, now, in a short time, very short, it will be enough to recognize what Willoughby's intentions are; it is very likely that he has gone to the city.</t2649> <t2650>The younger sister's eagerness about the trip indicates that she is looking forward to meeting him there.</t2650> <t2651>Elinor intends not only to explore new aspects of his character compared to what she has observed and heard others comment on, but also to pay attention to his gestures towards her sister, in order to understand what kind of person he is and what his intentions are.</t2651> <t2652>If what she observes is not favorable, she is determined to open her sister's eyes.</t2652> <t2653>On the other hand, if the result is the opposite, she will have a different reaction - at that time she will strive not to have any selfish comparisons, putting aside any regrets that might make her less happy with her sister's happiness.</t2653>
<t2654>Their journey lasted three days.</t2654> <t2655>Marianne's attitude during the trip was a vivid example for Mrs. Jennings to see how easygoing and sociable she would be in the coming days when traveling with her.</t2655> <t2656>Elinor was silent for most of the journey, immersed in her own thoughts, rarely initiating conversation, except when a beautiful landscape came into view, prompting her to utter words of praise directed only to her sister.</t2656>
<t2657>Afterwards, to make amends for this attitude, Elinor immediately took on the polite role she had assigned to herself, showing care for Mrs. Jennings, talking to her, joking with her, and listening to her whenever possible.</t2657> <t2658>As for Mrs. Jennings, she treated both of them very kindly, always asking if they were comfortable and enjoying themselves; her only complaint was that she couldn't let them choose their own food at the inn and didn't get to hear them admit they preferred trout over mackerel, or poultry over lamb chops.</t2658>
<t2659>They arrived in the city at three o'clock in the afternoon on Tuesday, delighted to be freed from the cramped carriage, ready to enjoy all the luxuries of a cozy fireplace.</t2659>
<t2660>The house has beautiful architecture and is equipped with beautiful furniture; and the two young girls were immediately taken to a very comfortable bedroom.</t2660> <t2661>This used to be Charlotte's room, and above the fireplace mantle still hangs the silk landscape painting that she loved, as evidence that she attended a famous school in the city.</t2661>
<t2662>Since there were still two hours until the meal, Elinor decided to use the time to write a letter to her mother, and she sat down to begin.</t2662> <t2663>In a moment, Marianne also prepared to write a letter.</t2663>
<t2664>Elinor said:</t2664>
<t2665>- Marianne, I'm writing a letter home; wouldn't it be better if you delayed your letter by a day or two?</t2665>
<t2666>- I didn't write to mom.</t2666>
<t2667>Elinor said nothing more.</t2667> <t2668>She suddenly thought that her sister wanted to write a letter to Willoughby.</t2668> <t2669>The immediate conclusion was that, although they wanted to keep their relationship somewhat mysterious, they must have made a commitment to each other.</t2669> <t2670>This speculation, while not entirely satisfactory, pleased her; and she continued her letter with all eagerness.</t2670> <t2671>Marianne finished in just a few minutes; it couldn't have been longer than a note.</t2671> <t2672>She folded the letter, sealed the envelope, and quickly wrote the address.</t2672> <t2673>Elinor thought she had recognized a "W" from the direction of the pen; and as soon as she finished writing, Marianne rang the bell, requesting a servant to take the letter to the post office.</t2673> <t2674>This immediately confirmed the suspicion.</t2674>
<t2675>Her younger sister's spirits were still high; but there was a certain agitation that prevented her from bringing joy to her older sister, and this agitation increased as the evening approached.</t2675> <t2676>She couldn't eat much during dinner, and afterwards, when they returned to the family room, she restlessly listened to the sound of each passing carriage.</t2676>
<t2677>Elinor was glad to realize that Mrs. Jennings did not see much of what was happening because she was busy in her own room.</t2677> <t2678>Tea was brought in, and after Marianne had been disappointed several times by the sound of knocking at the neighboring house, suddenly there was a loud knock that could not be mistaken for any other house.</t2678> <t2679>Elinor calmly waited for the news of Willoughby's arrival; while Marianne stood up and went to the door.</t2679> <t2680>Everything was silent; this could not last many seconds.</t2680> <t2681>Her sister opened the door, took a few steps towards the stairs, and after half a minute of listening, returned to the room with all the excitement that showed there was only one reason: she had heard he was coming.</t2681> <t2682>In this moment of utmost emotion, she could not help but exclaim, "Oh, Elinor, it is Willoughby, it truly is him!"; and as she seemed ready to fall into his arms, Colonel Brandon appeared.</t2682>
<t2683>She was so shocked that she couldn't keep her composure and immediately stepped out of the room.</t2683> <t2684>Elinor was also disappointed, but at the same time, her respect for Colonel Brandon made her greet him.</t2684> <t2685>She felt somewhat hurt that a man who had such affection for her sister would realize that her sister was in pain and disappointed to see him.</t2685> <t2686>She immediately saw that he also realized this, that he had observed when her sister stepped out, so surprised and worried that he forgot to maintain his manners with the elder sister.</t2686>
<t2687>He asked:</t2687>
<t2688>- Is your younger sibling not feeling well</t2688><t2689>?</t2689>
<t2690>Elinor miserably replied that it was just as he guessed, then spoke about headaches, low spirits, and fatigue - everything she could attribute to her sister's behavior.</t2690>
<t2691>He particularly paid close attention to her, but then seemed to regain his composure, asked no further questions, and began to express his joy at meeting the two of them again in London, inquiring as usual about their trip and the relatives still at home.</t2691>
<t2692>In such a calm manner, with neither side concentrating much, the two continued their conversation, both losing enthusiasm; each one's thoughts were occupied elsewhere.</t2692> <t2693>Elinor very much wanted to ask whether Willoughby was in town or not, but she feared he would be upset by a question about his rival.</t2693> <t2694>Finally, to find something to talk about, she asked if he had stayed in town since they last parted.</t2694>
<t2695>He replied:</t2695>
<t2696>- Yes, almost since then; I went to Delaford once or twice in a few days, but had no opportunity to return to Barton.</t2696>
<t2697>This matter, and through the way it was spoken, immediately made her recall all the situations when he left that place, causing Mrs. Jennings confusion and wonder, and she feared her question implied more curiosity than she thought deep down.</t2697>
<t2698>Not long after, Mrs. Jennings came in.</t2698> <t2699>In her usual loud and cheerful voice, she said:</t2699>
<t2700>- Oh! Colonel, I am extremely happy to see you again - I'm very sorry I couldn't come earlier - please forgive me, but I had to take care of some personal matters, check on the household because I've been away for quite a long time, and you know, one always has a mountain of trivial tasks after being absent; and then I had to work with Cartwright to sort everything out.</t2700> <t2701>My God, I've been swamped since I finished dinner!</t2701> <t2702>But hey, Colonel, how did you know I was back in the city today?</t2702>
<t2703>- I was fortunate to hear the news through Mr. Palmer's family when I went there for a meal.</t2703>
<t2704>- Ah, is that so; how is the whole family?</t2704> <t2705>How is Charlotte?</t2705> <t2706>I assure you, at this moment, the child's body must be quite heavy.</t2706>
<t2707>- Miss Palmer still looks well, and I was asked to convey that she will definitely meet her tomorrow.</t2707>
<t2708>- Alright, I think so too.</t2708> <t2709>Oh, Colonel, I brought back two young ladies, you see... I mean, now you only see one, but the other one is somewhere around.</t2709> <t2710>There's also your friend, Miss Marianne - which you'll be pleased to hear.</t2710> <t2711>I don't know how things stand between you and Mr. Willoughby regarding her.</t2711> <t2712>Well, being young and beautiful is a good thing.</t2712> <t2713>Ah! There was a time when I was young too, but I was never beautiful - most unfortunate for me.</t2713> <t2714>However, I had a really good husband, and I don't know if the greatest beauty could have gotten me anything better.</t2714> <t2715>Ah! Poor him! He's been gone for over eight years.</t2715> <t2716>But Colonel, where have you been since we parted?</t2716> <t2717>How is your work going?</t2717> <t2718>Now, now, there should be no secrets between friends.</t2718>
<t2719>He answered all her questions with his usual gentle demeanor, but none of his responses satisfied her.</t2719> <t2720>Now Elinor began to prepare tea, and Marianne was compelled to reappear.</t2720>
<t2721>After she entered, Colonel Brandon became more thoughtful and silent, and Mrs. Jennings could not invite him to stay any longer.</t2721> <t2722>There were no other guests that evening, and the women agreed to retire early.</t2722>
<t2723>Marianne woke up the next morning with a restored spirit and a happy demeanor.</t2723> <t2724>The disappointment of the previous night seemed to have quickly faded into oblivion, making way for the anticipation of what the day would bring.</t2724> <t2725>Just after finishing breakfast, Mrs. Palmer's large horse-drawn carriage stopped at the gate, and a few minutes later she entered, laughing heartily, so delighted to see everyone again that it was hard to tell if she was happier to see her mother or the two Miss Dashwoods. She was surprised that the two friends had come to the city, although she had been expecting them, and was annoyed that they accepted her mother's invitation after having declined hers, yet at the same time, she would never have forgiven them if they hadn't come!</t2725>
<t2726>She said:</t2726>
<t2727>- Mr. Palmer will be very happy to see you two again.</t2727> <t2728>When he heard that you two were coming with your mother, do you know what he said? I forgot now, but it was very funny!</t2728>
<t2729>After one or two hours of what the mother called comfortable gossip, or in other words, a series of questions from Mrs. Jennings about acquaintances and bursts of unprovoked laughter from Miss Palmer, she suggested that everyone accompany her to see a few shops where she had some errands to run that morning.</t2729> <t2730>Mrs. Jennings and Elinor immediately agreed as they wanted to buy a few items, and Marianne, after initially refusing, was also persuaded to go along.</t2730>
<t2731>Everywhere they went, Marianne looked around attentively.</t2731> <t2732>Especially on Bond Street where they went shopping, her eyes were always searching.</t2732> <t2733>In every store while they were busy, her mind was distracted, no longer paying attention to what was in front of her that everyone else was focused on and busy with.</t2733> <t2734>Restless and dissatisfied everywhere, she did not respond to her sister's requests for opinions on any items, even those that concerned both of them.</t2734> <t2735>She found no pleasure in anything, only anxious to return home.</t2735> <t2736>She was also annoyed with Mrs. Palmer, who was too captivated by everything luxurious, expensive, or novel; wanting to buy everything but unable to decide on anything, spending time wandering in excitement and indecision.</t2736>
<t2737>They arrived home near noon.</t2737> <t2738>As soon as they entered, Marianne hurriedly ran up the stairs, and when Elinor followed, she saw her sister walk away from the writing desk with a sorrowful expression indicating that Willoughby had not been there.</t2738>
<t2739>She asked the butler when he brought the packages in:</t2739>
<t2740>- Are there any letters left for me since we went out?</t2740>
<t2741>He answered no.</t2741>
<t2742>- Are you sure about that?</t2742> <t2743>Are you sure that the servants or porters didn't leave any letters or messages?</t2743>
<t2744>He answered that there was nothing.</t2744>
<t2745>Turning her face towards the window in despair, she whispered:</t2745>
<t2746>- How strange!</t2746>
<t2747>Worriedly looking at her sister, Elinor repeated in her mind: "Yes, it's really strange!</t2747> <t2748>If the girl didn't know he was in the city, she wouldn't write to him; she would have written to Combe Magna; and if he is in the city, it's really strange that he hasn't visited or written! Oh! My dear mother, you were mistaken to allow such a young girl to be engaged to such an unfamiliar man, in such a suspicious, mysterious manner! I want to find out, but how can my involvement be accepted?"</t2748>
<t2749>After thinking it over, she decided that if everything continued to appear as it did for several more days, she would firmly suggest to her mother that it was necessary to seriously inquire about the matter.</t2749>
<t2750>Miss Palmer and two of Mrs. Jennings' friends were invited to dinner with them.</t2750> <t2751>Miss Palmer left after having tea to take care of the remaining tasks, and Elinor had to help set up the whist table for the others.</t2751> <t2752>Marianne was of no help on these occasions as she never wanted to learn to play cards; but despite having free time, she did not enjoy the evening as much as Elinor, being constantly anxious with anticipation and suffering from disappointment.</t2752> <t2753>Occasionally, she forced herself to read, but after a short while, she would set the book aside, pace around the room, pause momentarily when passing the window, longing to hear an unmistakable knock on the door, but having to wait for a long time.</t2753>
<t2754>Chapter 27</t2754>
<t2755>When everyone sat down for breakfast the next day, Mrs. Jennings said:</t2755>
<t2756>K</t2756>
<t2757>- If the warm weather like this continues, Sir John would only want to go hunting and not leave Barton Park next week.</t2757> <t2758>It's quite sad for the hunters to lose a day of outdoor activity.</t2758> <t2759>Poor them!</t2759> <t2760>I always feel for them, because they consider hunting to be extremely important.</t2760>
<t2761>Marianne walked to the window to check the weather and then exclaimed:</t2761>
<t2762>- That's right. I didn't think of this.</t2762> <t2763>Such weather will attract many people with a sporting spirit to go out into nature.</t2763>
<t2764>This is a fortunate memory, lifting her spirits as she sat down at the breakfast table with a happy face.</t2764> <t2765>She continued:</t2765>
<t2766>- The weather is really lovely for them.</t2766> <t2767>They will be very delighted! But (with a bit of worry returning) it cannot last.</t2767> <t2768>At this time of year and after such a rain, surely we cannot enjoy anything more.</t2768> <t2769>Soon there will be frost, possibly quite heavy.</t2769> <t2770>Maybe in one or two days; weather this warm cannot last long - no, perhaps tonight there will be frost.</t2770>
<t2771>Not wanting Mrs. Jennings to recognize her sister's thoughts as she did, Elinor said:</t2771>
<t2772>- Anyway, Sir John and Lady Middleton will definitely come to the city next weekend.</t2772>
<t2773>- Yes, dear, I'm sure of it.</t2773> <t2774>Mary always wants to have her way.</t2774>
<t2775>Elinor thought to herself: "Now the girl will send a letter to Combe via express delivery."</t2775>
<t2776>If she really did write, she discreetly wrote and sent the letter, escaping her sister's scrutiny to ascertain the truth.</t2776> <t2777>No matter what the truth was, and although Elinor was not entirely at ease, seeing Marianne in high spirits, she did not worry much.</t2777> <t2778>And Marianne was indeed in high spirits: happy with the cozy weather, and even happier anticipating the frost.</t2778>
<t2779>The morning passed by leaving visiting cards at the homes of Mrs. Jennings' acquaintances to announce her return to the city.</t2779> <t2780>Marianne was always busy looking at the direction of the wind, observing the changes in the sky, and imagining alterations in the air.</t2780>
<t2781>- Sister Elinor, do you feel that it is colder this morning than before?</t2781> <t2782>It seems to me that there is a noticeable difference.</t2782> <t2783>I find it hard to keep my hands warm even when wearing gloves.</t2783> <t2784>I think it wasn't this cold yesterday.</t2784> <t2785>It looks like the sky is clearing up, the sun will come out in a moment, and we will have a clear afternoon.</t2785>
<t2786>Elinor was both distracted and distressed; but Marianne remained persistent, and saw, each evening by the firelight and each morning by the color of the sky, some signs of the approaching frost.</t2786>
<t2787>The two Miss Dashwoods had no greater reason to complain about Mrs. Jennings' lifestyle and her acquaintances than her consistently kind attitude towards them.</t2787> <t2788>All family arrangements were made comfortable.</t2788> <t2789>Except for a few old friends in the city whom Lady Middleton regretted she could not defer, she did not visit anyone if she thought the introduction might embarrass the two young ladies.</t2789> <t2790>Relieved to be in a more pleasant situation than she initially feared, Elinor responded to the desire to be cheerful during evening gatherings at home or outings, only to play cards, but she did not enjoy it.</t2790>
<t2791>Colonel Brandon was always invited, almost daily, to visit Marianne and converse with Elinor.</t2791> <t2792>Elinor was happier to talk with him than to engage in other daily activities, but at the same time, she was worried that he still harbored feelings for her sister.</t2792> <t2793>She feared that these feelings were growing deeper.</t2793> <t2794>She was heartbroken to see his devotion to Marianne, and his spirits were certainly lower than when he was at Barton.</t2794>
<t2795>About a week after they arrived in the city, everyone knew for sure that Willoughby would come.</t2795> <t2796>His calling card was on the table when they returned from their outing.</t2796>
<t2797>Marianne exclaimed:</t2797>
<t2798>- Oh my God! He came here when we were away.</t2798>
<t2799>Happy to know that you are in the city, Elinor said:</t2799>
<t2800>- Just believe it, he will come again tomorrow.</t2800>
<t2801>But Marianne seemed not to hear her clearly.</t2801> <t2802>When Mrs. Jennings entered, she hid away with the precious card.</t2802>
<t2803>This event uplifted Elinor's spirits and restored her sister's morale, and above all, brought back the liveliness from before.</t2803> <t2804>From this moment on, her sister's mind was never at peace; every hour of the day she anticipated meeting him again, she had no mind for anything else.</t2804> <t2805>She was determined to stay home the next morning, when everyone else was away.</t2805>
<t2806>Elinor's thoughts were always directed towards what might happen at Berkeley Street 1 in their absence; but when they returned, just a glance at her sister told her that Willoughby had not come a second time.</t2806> <t2807>At that moment, a servant brought in a letter and placed it on the table.</t2807>
<t2808>Marianne hurriedly stepped forward:</t2808>
<t2809>- Mine!</t2809>
<t2810>- No, ma'am, it's my mistress's.</t2810>
<t2811>But Marianne did not believe it, she picked up the letter:</t2811>
<t2812>- It's indeed Mrs. Jennings'.</t2812> <t2813>How annoying!</t2813>
<t2814>Elinor could no longer remain silent:</t2814>
<t2815>- So, you are waiting for a letter, aren't you?</t2815>
<t2816>- Yes, just a little - not hoping much.</t2816>
<t2817>After a brief hesitation, the older sister said:</t2817>
<t2818>- Marianne, you are not open with me.</t2818>
<t2819>- No, Elinor, is this reproach really coming from you?</t2819> <t2820>You are the one who isn't open with anyone!</t2820>
<t2821>Elinor repeated with a bit of confusion:</t2821>
<t2822>- Sister! Marianne, in fact, you have nothing to tell.</t2822>
<t2823>Marianne was somewhat excited:</t2823>
<t2824>- Me too, our circumstances are the same.</t2824> <t2825>We both have nothing to tell: you, because you don't want to convey anything, and me, because I have nothing to hide.</t2825>
<t2826>Sad because of the contradictory accusation that she could not dismiss, in this situation Elinor did not know how to urge Marianne to be more open.</t2826>
<t2827>Mrs. Jennings came over and read the letter that had been brought to her.</t2827> <t2828>It was a letter from Lady Middleton, informing her that they had arrived at Conduit Street the night before and inviting her and her cousins to join them.</t2828> <t2829>Since Sir John was busy and she had a cold, they could not visit Berkeley Street.</t2829> <t2830>They accepted the invitation; but as the appointed time approached, Elinor had a hard time convincing Marianne to agree to go, as both sisters felt obliged to accompany Mrs. Jennings on such a visit out of courtesy.</t2830> <t2831>However, since she had not yet seen Willoughby, the younger sister had no desire to go out, fearing he might come while she was away.</t2831>
<t2832>When the evening had passed, Elinor saw that this temperament had not changed with the change of residence, for although they had just arrived in the city, Sir John had managed to invite over twenty young people and organized a dance to entertain them.</t2832> <t2833>However, Lady Middleton did not approve of this manner.</t2833> <t2834>In the countryside, an impromptu dance was acceptable; but in London, where the reputation for elegance is more important and harder to build, if word were to spread that Lady Middleton had organized a dance for eight or nine couples, with only two violins and a modestly arranged light meal, the risk of gossip would be too great just to indulge a few young girls.</t2834>
<t2835>The Palmer couple was also present.</t2835> <t2836>Wanting to avoid appearing concerned about his mother-in-law, he never approached her, so when they entered, he did not greet them properly, even though he had not seen them since they arrived in the city.</t2836> <t2837>He only glanced at the two ladies, pretending not to know who they were, and stood at the end of the room, nodding to Mrs. Jennings.</t2837> <t2838>Marianne scanned the room as soon as she entered; that was enough - he wasn't here.</t2838> <t2839>Then she sat down, not caring to socialize with anyone.</t2839>
<t2840>After they had been gathered for about an hour, Mr. Palmer leisurely approached the two Miss Dashwoods to express his surprise at meeting them in the city, although Colonel Brandon had previously informed him at his house that the two ladies were coming, and he himself had made some humorous remarks about it.</t2840> <t2841>He said:</t2841>
<t2842>- I think the two ladies are in Devonshire.</t2842>
<t2843>Elinor replied:</t2843>
<t2844>- Really?</t2844>
<t2845>- When will you two return?</t2845>
<t2846>- I don't know.</t2846>
<t2847>Thus ends the conversation.</t2847>
<t2848>Never in her life had Marianne been so disheartened by dancing, never so exhausted.</t2848> <t2849>She lamented about this as they returned to Berkeley Street.</t2849>
<t2850>- Hey, hey, we know the reason very well; if there was some anonymous person present, you wouldn't be tired at all; and to be honest, he is quite impolite to be invited and still not come to see you.</t2850>
<t2851>Marianne exclaimed:</t2851>
<t2852>- Invited!</t2852>
<t2853>- My daughter told me that, because this morning it seems Sir John saw you somewhere on the street.</t2853>
<t2854>Marianne said nothing more, but she appeared deeply hurt.</t2854> <t2855>Anxious to do something in this situation to help her sister, the next morning Elinor decided to write a letter to their mother, hoping to make her see the issue and be concerned for Marianne's health, so that she would inquire about the matter herself instead of delaying any longer.</t2855> <t2856>This intention became even more resolute when, after breakfast the following day, she noticed Marianne writing another letter to Willoughby, as she couldn't think of anyone else her sister would be writing to.</t2856>
<t2857>In the middle of the day, Mrs. Jennings had to go take care of some business, and she began to write a letter while Marianne was too restless to do anything, too anxious to converse, only moving from one window to another, or sitting by the fireplace in gloomy contemplation.</t2857> <t2858>Elinor was very earnest in her advice to her mother, recounting everything that had happened, her doubts about Willoughby's fidelity, and in every way of duty and affection, she urged her to demand Marianne to reveal the true situation regarding her relationship with him.</t2858>
<t2859>When she had not yet finished the letter, a knock on the door signaled a visitor, and the servant announced Colonel Brandon's arrival.</t2859> <t2860>Marianne had seen him through the window and left the room before he entered, as she loathed meeting anyone.</t2860>
<t2861>He looked more serious than usual, and although he seemed pleased to see only Miss Daswood, as if he had something special to say to her, he sat for a while without saying a word.</t2861> <t2862>Believing that he wanted to talk about her sister, Elinor patiently waited for him to speak.</t2862> <t2863>This was not the first time she had the same feeling; for more than once, starting with the remark "Your sister doesn't look well today," or "Your sister seems to be down," he would get to the subject either to deliver some news or to inquire about some details regarding her sister.</t2863>
<t2864>After a few moments of silence, in a trembling voice, he asked when he would be able to congratulate her on having a brother-in-law.</t2864> <t2865>Elinor was not prepared for such a question, and not having a ready answer, she had to resort to the simple and usual tactic of asking what he meant.</t2865>
<t2866>He forced a smile when he replied:</t2866>
<t2867>- Many people already know about your sister's engagement to Mr. Willoughby.</t2867>
<t2868>Elinor responded:</t2868>
<t2869>- Not many people knew, because even its own family didn't know.</t2869>
<t2870>He appeared surprised:</t2870>
<t2871>- Excuse me, ma'am, I fear my question may be improper, but I did not think there was any intention to keep it a secret, as the two openly exchanged letters, and many people have discussed their wedding.</t2871>
<t2872>- How is that possible?</t2872> <t2873>Who did you hear this news from?</t2873>
<t2874>- Among many people - a few she did not know at all, others she knew very well - Mrs. Jennings, Miss Palmer, and the Middleton family.</t2874> <t2875>But I might still not believe - because perhaps when the heart does not want to believe, it will always find something to doubt - if, when the servant greeted me today, I had not happened to see a letter in his hand, addressed to Mr. Willoughby in your sister's handwriting.</t2875>
<t2876>- I came to inquire, but I believed it to be true before asking the question.</t2876> <t2877>Has everything been arranged already?</t2877> <t2878>Could it be...?</t2878> <t2879>But I have no right, and I cannot have the chance for my wish to come true.</t2879>
<t2880>"Miss Daswood, please forgive me.</t2880> <t2881>I believe I was wrong to speak so much, but I did not know what to do, and I trust in your prudence.</t2881> <t2882>Just let me know that everything has been decided, that all efforts... that now it is just to bury it, if it can be buried."</t2882>
<t2883>These words deeply moved Elinor, for she understood that this was his direct expression of love for her sister.</t2883> <t2884>For a moment, she was unable to speak, and even when she regained her composure, she hesitated for a while to think about how to respond appropriately.</t2884> <t2885>She knew very little about the true situation between Willoughby and her sister, so if she tried to explain awkwardly, she could only say as little as possible.</t2885> <t2886>But because she believed that Marianne's feelings for Willoughby gave Colonel Brandon no hope, regardless of how these feelings developed, and at the same time she did not want her own conduct to be criticized, after some consideration, she thought it best to be cautious and kind, to say more than she truly knew or believed.</t2886> <t2887>Therefore, she acknowledged that although they had never confided in her about their feelings for each other, she had no doubt that they were in love, and was not surprised to hear about their correspondence.</t2887>
<t2888>He silently listened to her, and when she finished speaking, he stood up and said in a voice full of emotion:</t2888>
<t2889>- As for your sister, I wish her all the happiness imaginable; and as for Willoughby, I hope he strives to prove himself worthy of her.</t2889>
<t2890>Then he said goodbye and left.</t2890>
<t2891>Elinor was not comfortable with this conversation to alleviate the concerns in her mind about other aspects.</t2891> <t2892>On the contrary, she still harbored a lingering sense of melancholy about Colonel Brandon's unfortunate situation, and she could not even wish to erase this misfortune while she anxiously awaited confirmation that he was indeed unfortunate.</t2892>
<t2893>Chapter 28</t2893>
<t2894>Nothing happened in the next three or four days to make Elinor regret writing to urge her mother, as Willoughby neither visited nor sent a letter.</t2894>
<t2895>K</t2895>
<t2896>After this period, they were invited to accompany Lady Middleton to a gathering without Mrs. Jennings, because her youngest daughter was unwell.</t2896> <t2897>Marianne prepared to attend without enthusiasm: careless about her appearance, seemingly indifferent to going out or staying home, showing no signs of hope or interest.</t2897> <t2898>After having tea, she sat by the fireplace in the family room waiting for Lady Middleton to arrive, motionless, with an expressionless face, lost in thought, not noticing her sister beside her.</t2898> <t2899>When they were informed that Lady Middleton was waiting at the front door, she walked as if she had forgotten someone was waiting.</t2899>
<t2900>They arrived on time, got off the vehicle, ascended the stairs, heard their names clearly announced from one landing to the next, and then entered a brilliantly lit, rather crowded, and extremely hot room.</t2900> <t2901>After the two ladies curtseyed to the hostess of the house, they were allowed to mingle with the crowd, sharing the heat and inconvenience to which they also contributed.</t2901> <t2902>After a while of not talking much and doing nothing, Lady Middleton sat down at the casino card table, and since Marianne did not care to wander around, she and Elinor were fortunate to find two empty chairs, sitting near the card table.</t2902>
<t2903>The two ladies had not been seated for long when Elinor noticed Willoughby, standing a few steps away, enthusiastically conversing with a very elegantly dressed woman.</t2903> <t2904>Soon he recognized the elder sister, immediately bowed to her, but showed no intention of engaging in conversation with her or approaching Marianne, although he could not possibly have failed to see the younger sister; then he continued his conversation with the other woman.</t2904> <t2905>Suddenly, Elinor glanced at Marianne to see if her sister had noticed him.</t2905>
<t2906>Just as the younger sister recognized him, her entire face lit up with unexpected joy; she could have gone to him immediately if her older sister hadn't held her back.</t2906> <t2907>She blurted out:</t2907>
<t2908>- Oh my God! He's here - he's here.</t2908> <t2909>Oh! Why doesn't he look at me?</t2909> <t2910>Why can't I talk to him?</t2910>
<t2911>Elinor exclaimed:</t2911>
<t2912>- Hey, hey, you need to stay calm, don't show your emotions to everyone.</t2912> <t2913>Maybe he hasn't seen you yet.</t2913>
<t2914>However, she could not believe this; and now keeping calm was too much of an effort for Marianne, as well as too much to expect from her sister.</t2914> <t2915>She sat with an expression of suffering due to impatience, her whole body agitated.</t2915>
<t2916>Finally, he turned around once more, looking at both of them; she stood up, called his name with a tender voice, and reached out her hand towards him.</t2916> <t2917>He approached, speaking to Elinor instead of Marianne, as if to avoid her gaze and deliberately ignoring her demeanor, hastily inquiring about Mrs. Dashwood, and asking how long they had been in the city.</t2917> <t2918>Elinor was completely bewildered by such behavior, unable to utter a word.</t2918>
<t2919>But her sister's feelings were immediately displayed.</t2919> <t2920>Her whole face turned red, and with the most emotional voice, she exclaimed:</t2920>
<t2921>- My God! Willoughby, what does this mean? Did you receive my letters? Don't you want to shake hands with me?</t2921>
<t2922>He couldn't avoid it, but when she touched him, he seemed truly miserable, and he held her hand for just a split second.</t2922> <t2923>All this time, it was clear that he was trying to calm himself.</t2923> <t2924>Elinor watched his face and saw him gradually return to a state of calm.</t2924>
<t2925>After a moment of silence, he slowly said:</t2925>
<t2926>- Last Tuesday, I had the honor of visiting Berkeley Street, and unfortunately, I was not lucky enough to meet you two and Mrs. Jennings.</t2926> <t2927>I hope my business card was not lost.</t2927>
<t2928>Marianne exclaimed in the most fervent excitement:</t2928>
<t2929>- But did you receive any of my messages?</t2929> <t2930>I believe there was some mistake - some terrible mistake.</t2930> <t2931>What does it mean? Willoughby, tell me; speak up, what is going on?</t2931>
<t2932>He did not answer, his face turned red, and he became flustered again.</t2932> <t2933>Then, when he caught the eye of the woman he had been talking to earlier, as if needing to compose himself immediately, he calmed himself and said:</t2933>
<t2934>- Yes, I am pleased to receive the news that you kindly sent me saying you are coming to the city.</t2934>
<t2935>Then he hurriedly bowed his head in a gentle farewell and returned to his girlfriend.</t2935>
<t2936>Marianne was now deathly pale and unable to stand, collapsing into a chair.</t2936> <t2937>Fearing that her sister might faint at any moment, Elinor tried to shield her from the view of others while calming her with lavender water.</t2937>
<t2938>As soon as she could speak, Marianne exclaimed:</t2938>
<t2939>- Sister Elinor, go find him and make him come here to see me.</t2939> <t2940>Tell him I must see him - you must tell him immediately.</t2940> <t2941>I can't sit still - I won't have a moment of peace if he doesn't explain - there is a terrible misunderstanding or something.</t2941> <t2942>Oh, please go see him right now.</t2942>
<t2943>- How can that be done? No, my dear Marianne, you must wait.</t2943> <t2944>This is not the place to explain.</t2944> <t2945>Wait until tomorrow.</t2945>
<t2946>However, it was very difficult for her to prevent her sister from going to him on her own.</t2946> <t2947>She also couldn't persuade her sister to control her emotions, to at least stay calm until they could talk privately with him to sort things out.</t2947> <t2948>Marianne continuously lamented about the sorrow in her heart, complaining about her unfortunate situation.</t2948> <t2949>For a moment, Elinor saw Willoughby leave the room through the door leading to the stairs.</t2949> <t2950>She informed Marianne that he had left, saying it was impossible to talk to him tonight, and reminded her sister once again to stay calm.</t2950> <t2951>She begged her sister to ask Lady Middleton to take them home, as her sister was too distressed to stay any longer.</t2951>
<t2952>Even though she was in the middle of a card game when she heard that Marianne was unwell, Lady Middleton was too polite to prevent her from leaving, handing her cards to a friend.</t2952> <t2953>No one said a word on the way back to Berkeley Street.</t2953> <t2954>Marianne was immersed in painful silence, her spirit so heavy that she could not cry.</t2954> <t2955>Fortunately, Mrs. Jennings had not yet returned, so they went straight to their private room, and a dose of hartshorn helped calm her somewhat.</t2955> <t2956>Marianne changed her clothes and went to bed, and since she seemed to want to be alone, her sister left, and while waiting for Mrs. Jennings to return, she had time to think about what had happened.</t2956>
<t2957>Elinor had no doubt about some sort of engagement between Willoughby and Marianne, and it was also clear that Willoughby had grown tired of it; for although Marianne still cherished her own hopes, she could not attribute such an attitude to any mistake or misunderstanding.</t2957> <t2958>Nothing else could explain it except a profound change in feelings.</t2958> <t2959>She could have been more indignant than before if she had not noticed the confusion that seemed to indicate he was aware of his wrongdoing.</t2959> <t2960>At the same time, she did not believe he was so unprincipled as to toy with her sister's affections from the very beginning without some calculation that needed to be examined.</t2960> <t2961>Distance might have caused his feelings to fade, and a convenient circumstance might have led him to lose control, but she was certain that feelings had blossomed between the two of them before.</t2961>
<t2962>She pondered deeply and worried for Marianne, as her sister had endured such acute pain after that unfortunate encounter, and might soon suffer even more severely from the consequences of the event.</t2962> <t2963>Compared to her sister, her own situation was better, for she could still hold Edward in high regard as she always had, regardless of how they might be separated in the future, and her spirits would always be uplifted.</t2963> <t2964>But it seemed that every possible circumstance could converge to make Marianne suffer more in the final separation from Willoughby - a separation that was immediate and irreparably broken.</t2964>
<t2965>Chapter 29</t2965>
<t2966>Before the hour when the servants would light the lamps for the two young ladies the next day, or before the sun's rays could pierce through a cold and gloomy February morning, Marianne, not yet properly dressed, knelt by the windowsill to catch a bit of light, writing quickly amidst her tears.</t2966> <t2967>The rustling sounds and her sobs woke Elinor, who recognized her sister; and after observing for a while in silent concern, she asked in the gentlest and most considerate tone:</t2967>
<t2968>T</t2968>
<t2969>- Marianne, can I ask you -?</t2969>
<t2970>- No, Elinor, don't ask anything; soon you will know everything.</t2970>
<t2971>The hopelessly calm manner in her speech did not last long, immediately followed by the same heavy sorrow as before.</t2971> <t2972>It took her a few minutes to continue writing the letter, and the waves of grief that surged at times made her struggle to hold the pen steady - all clear evidence that she was writing her final letter to Willoughby.</t2972>
<t2973>Elinor observed her sister in silence and did not interfere.</t2973> <t2974>She could have tried to comfort and soothe her sister further, if Marianne had not implored her with every appearance of the most passionate irritation not to speak to her.</t2974> <t2975>In these situations, it is better for both not to be near each other.</t2975> <t2976>Marianne's troubled mind made it impossible for her to confine herself to her room after changing her clothes, but compelled her to seek solitude and constantly change places, causing her to wander around the house until breakfast time, avoiding everyone.</t2976>
<t2977>At the dining table, Marianne did not eat anything, and did not try to eat anything.</t2977> <t2978>Elinor's attentions were not to advise, pity, or express affection for her sister, but to try to engage Mrs. Jennings so that she would focus only on her.</t2978>
<t2979>Because there were dishes that Mrs. Jennings loved, breakfast lasted quite a long time, and afterward, just as they were moving to the work table, a letter was delivered to Marianne.</t2979> <t2980>She snatched the envelope from the servant's hand and, her face as pale as death, immediately ran out of the room.</t2980> <t2981>Elinor had seen everything clearly as if she had anticipated the direction beforehand, knowing that this was a letter from Willoughby.</t2981> <t2982>She felt an immediate sharp pain in her heart that made it hard for her to lift her head, shuddering as she feared it would be difficult to avoid being seen by Mrs. Jennings.</t2982>
<t2983>However, this kind-hearted woman only saw that Marianne had received a letter from Willoughby, which was a subject of her jesting, and so she jested by laughing loudly and saying she hoped Marianne would read what she was expecting.</t2983> <t2984>She was busy measuring the length of the yarn for her carpet and did not notice Elinor's distress, calmly continuing to speak right after Marianne disappeared:</t2984>
<t2985>- I assure you, in my life I have never seen a young woman love so fiercely.</t2985> <t2986>My daughters are nothing compared to her, and yet they can be quite foolish at times; but as for Miss Marianne, she truly is an extraordinary person.</t2986> <t2987>In my heart, I hope he won't make her wait long, because it is truly heartbreaking to see her looking so sickly and forlorn.</t2987> <t2988>Please tell me, when will the two of them get married?</t2988>
<t2989>Even though Elinor had never wanted to remain silent as much as she did at that moment, she had to respond to the teasing remark, so forcing a smile, she replied:</t2989>
<t2990>- Madam, did you really want to personally persuade my sister to engage with Mr. Willoughby?</t2990> <t2991>I thought it was just a joke, but such a serious question seems to have an underlying meaning; therefore, I ask you not to pretend anymore.</t2991> <t2992>Please believe me when I say that nothing surprised me more than hearing that the two of you are getting married.</t2992>
<t2993>- It's such a shame, such a great shame, Miss Daswood! How could you say such a thing? We all know that the two of you are a perfect match, that the two of you have been madly in love since you first met, right?</t2993> <t2994>Wasn't it in Devonshire that I saw the two of you together every day and all day long; and didn't I know that your sister went to the city with me with the purpose of buying a wedding dress?</t2994> <t2995>Well, well, it's no use.</t2995> <t2996>Because you are so discreet, you think no one notices; but that's not true, I can tell you, because the whole city has known about this for a long time.</t2996> <t2997>I've told everyone and so has Charlotte.</t2997>
<t2998>Elinor said very solemnly:</t2998>
<t2999>- Madam, in fact, you are mistaken.</t2999> <t3000>Indeed, you are doing something quite unkind by spreading this news; and you will see that what I say is true, even if you do not believe me now.</t3000>
<t3001>Mrs. Jennings laughed again, but Elinor no longer had the spirit to say more.</t3001> <t3002>Eager to know what Willoughby had written, she hurried back to their room.</t3002> <t3003>When she opened the door, she saw Marianne lying on the bed, almost choking with grief, a letter clutched in her hand, two or three other letters lying beside her.</t3003> <t3004>Elinor approached, but said nothing.</t3004> <t3005>She sat down on the bed, took her sister's hand, kissed her warmly, then let herself burst into tears, starting as intensely as Marianne.</t3005>
<t3006>Her sister could not say anything, seemingly feeling all the tenderness, and after a moment of sharing all their sorrows like that, she placed all the letters into Elinor's hands; then buried her face in the handkerchief, almost screaming in grief.</t3006>
<t3007>Elinor understood that it was necessary to let such grief flow freely after the initial shock, so she did nothing more to comfort.</t3007> <t3008>She waited until her sister had somewhat calmed down, then turned to read Willoughby's letter.</t3008>
<t3009>Bond Street, February DEAR MADAM - I have just had the honor of receiving your letter, and I would like to express my sincere thanks for this.</t3009> <t3010>I am very concerned to learn that my behavior last night was in some way displeasing to you; and although I am quite puzzled as to how I could have inadvertently offended you, I earnestly beg your forgiveness for what I hope you believe was entirely unintentional.</t3010>
<t3011>I will never look back on the previous relationship with her family in Devonshire without feeling a cherished joy, and I feel self-satisfied that this relationship was not marred by any misunderstanding or misinterpretation of my actions.</t3011> <t3012>My respect for her entire family is very sincere; but if I were unfortunate enough to raise expectations beyond what my heart feels or intends to express, I would blame myself for not being more careful in showing that respect.</t3012>
<t3013>Please understand that I could not have any other intention, when you understand that my feelings have long been promised elsewhere, and I believe it will not be many weeks before this promise is fulfilled.</t3013>
<t3014>With deep regret, I must comply with your request to return the letters I had the honor of receiving from you, along with the lock of hair you so graciously bestowed upon me.</t3014>
<t3015>With utmost respect, JOHN WILLOUGHBY</t3015>
<t3016>It is understandable how enraged Elinor must have been with such a letter.</t3016> <t3017>Although before she began reading, she had guessed he would confess his lack of fidelity and confirm the permanent separation, she could not have imagined such language would be used to convey these ideas!</t3017> <t3018>She also could not think that Willoughby could detach himself from any semblance of honor and delicate feelings - completely removed from the upright character of a noble person - to send such a cruel and brazen letter: a letter that instead of expressing regret, acknowledged no breach of trust, denied any special feelings - a letter where every line was offensive, revealing the writer's seasoned dishonesty.</t3018>
<t3019>She pondered for a moment through her astonishment and indignation, then read the letter over and over; but each reading only made her more disgusted with the man, and more bitter towards him, to the point where she didn't have the confidence to speak.</t3019> <t3020>She feared she would hurt Marianne even more when she saw the breakup not as a loss of something good, but as a liberation from something most terrible and most malicious beyond reform, an escape from a lifelong relationship with a man without principles, which was the truest rescue, the greatest blessing.</t3020>
<t3021>While anxiously pondering the contents of the letter, the depraved mind that had written it, and perhaps, a very peculiar mindset of a very peculiar person who had no connection whatsoever with the affair except for what her heart had given him, Elinor no longer remembered her sister's suffering, no longer remembered that there were three other letters she had not read, and did not remember the time she had spent sitting in the room, to the point that when she heard the sound of a carriage arriving at the door, she went to the window to see who had inconsiderately come so early.</t3021>
<t3022>She was surprised to recognize Mrs. Jennings' carriage.</t3022> <t3023>With the intention of not wanting to leave Marianne even though she did not expect to be of any help at the moment, Elinor hurried to ask Mrs. Jennings for a postponement, citing that her sister was not well.</t3023> <t3024>Through her always cheerful concern about the cause of her sister's condition, Mrs. Jennings immediately accepted her request, and after seeing her off, she returned to Marianne.</t3024>
<t3025>She saw her younger sister struggling to sit up on the bed, just in time to catch her from falling to the floor, unconscious and dizzy from sleeplessness and not eating.</t3025> <t3026>Many days had passed without the little girl having any appetite, and many nights without a good sleep.</t3026> <t3027>Now, when her mind was no longer buoyed by the fever of excitement, the lingering effects were evident through her dizzy head, empty stomach, and nearly unconscious nerves.</t3027>
<t3028>Elinor brought a glass of wine to help her sister feel better, and finally, the younger sister was able to express a bit of affection.</t3028>
<t3029>- Poor Elinor!</t3029> <t3030>How much I have made you suffer!</t3030>
<t3031>The older sister replied:</t3031>
<t3032>- I just hope to be able to do anything to bring you some relief.</t3032>
<t3033>This, like any other thing, was too much for Marianne.</t3033> <t3034>She could only utter from the sorrow in her heart:</t3034>
<t3035>- Oh! Sister Elinor, I am so miserable!</t3035>
<t3036>Then her words were drowned out by the sounds of sobbing.</t3036>
<t3037>Elinor could no longer bear to silently witness this unbearable pain.</t3037> <t3038>She exclaimed:</t3038>
<t3039>- Dear Marianne, you must make an effort yourself, otherwise you will destroy yourself and those who love you.</t3039> <t3040>Think of your mother, think of her suffering while you are in pain; for her sake, you must lift yourself up.</t3040>
<t3041>Marianne cried:</t3041>
<t3042>- I can't, I can't do it, leave me alone, leave me alone if I make you sad; leave me, hate me, forget me!</t3042> <t3043>But don't torture me like this! Oh! It's too easy for those who don't know suffering themselves to advise others to lift themselves up! Elinor is happy, too happy, she can't understand how much I suffer.</t3043>
<t3044>- Marianne, you say I'm happy? Huh! If only you knew! And do you believe that I could be happy seeing you in such misery?</t3044>
<t3045>The little sister wrapped her arms around her older sister's neck:</t3045>
<t3046>- Please forgive me, forgive me, I know you feel compassion for me; I also know how your heart feels; but even so, you are... you truly are happy; Edward loves you... what, oh yes, what could possibly shatter such happiness?</t3046>
<t3047>Elinor seriously:</t3047>
<t3048>- Many situations, very many.</t3048>
<t3049>- No, no, no, he loves you, and only loves you.</t3049> <t3050>It is impossible for you to suffer.</t3050>
<t3051>- I am not happy to see you in this situation.</t3051>
<t3052>- And you will never see me any different from this.</t3052> <t3053>Nothing can dispel my suffering.</t3053>
<t3054>- Marianne, you must not speak like that.</t3054> <t3055>Do you have no source of comfort?</t3055> <t3056>Do you have no friends?</t3056> <t3057>Is there nothing to soothe your loss?</t3057> <t3058>No matter how much you are suffering now, think of how much more you would suffer if you only discovered his true character later - if the two of you had been engaged month after month and then he decided to end it.</t3058> <t3059>As for you, another day of uncertain love would only make the outcome more tragic.</t3059>
<t3060>Marianne exclaimed:</t3060>
<t3061>- Promises! There are no promises.</t3061>
<t3062>- No promises?</t3062>
<t3063>- No, he is not the scoundrel you think he is.</t3063> <t3064>He has not betrayed my trust at all.</t3064>
<t3065>- But he said he loves you.</t3065>
<t3066>- That's right... but no... never... absolutely.</t3066> <t3067>Every day has a hidden meaning, but it has never been expressed.</t3067> <t3068>Sometimes I think he has confessed - but in reality, he never has.</t3068>
<t3069>- And yet you sent him a letter?</t3069>
<t3070>- Yes.</t3070> <t3071>Is this wrong after what has been shown?</t3071> <t3072>But I can't talk.</t3072>
<t3073>Elinor didn't say anything more, turning back to the three letters that now made her more curious than ever.</t3073> <t3074>She glanced through the contents of all three.</t3074> <t3075>The first letter, sent by her younger sister immediately after arriving in the city, was as follows.</t3075>
<t3076>Berkeley Street, February, Mr. Willoughby, you must be so surprised to receive this letter, and I believe you will feel something more than surprise when you know I am in the city.</t3076> <t3077>An opportunity came by chance, even with Mrs. Jennings, it was an attraction that my sister and I could not resist.</t3077> <t3078>I wish you would receive this letter in time for tonight, but I do not dare to hope.</t3078> <t3079>Anyway, I await you tomorrow.</t3079> <t3080>In the meantime, goodbye.</t3080>
<t3081>M.</t3081> <t3082>D.</t3082>
<t3083>The second letter from her, written on the morning after the dance at the Middleton residence, is as follows:</t3083>
<t3084>I cannot express my disappointment for not being able to meet you the day before yesterday, and my surprise at not receiving a reply to the letter I sent you about a week ago.</t3084> <t3085>Every hour of the day passed by, I was hoping for news from you, and most of all, hoping to meet you.</t3085> <t3086>Please come as soon as possible and explain to me why I have to wait in vain like this.</t3086> <t3087>Next time, you should come earlier because the whole family is usually out at one o'clock.</t3087> <t3088>Last night, everyone went to Lady Middleton's residence, where there was a ball.</t3088> <t3089>I heard you were invited to attend.</t3089> <t3090>But how could that be? You must have changed a lot since we parted, so you didn't go to the ball.</t3090> <t3091>But I don't believe you could change, so I hope to hear it confirmed by you soon.</t3091>
<t3092>M.</t3092> <t3093>D.</t3093>
<t3094>The content of the last letter written to you is as follows:</t3094>
<t3095>Willoughby, how am I to imagine your attitude last night?</t3095> <t3096>Once again, I want you to explain this matter.</t3096> <t3097>I was prepared to meet you again with the joy that our separation would naturally bring, according to the familiarity that our close relationship at Barton seemed to have demonstrated.</t3097> <t3098>I was truly rejected! I endured a miserable night trying to forgive a demeanor that is hard to call anything less than an insult; but although I cannot yet conceive a reasonable apology for your behavior, I am entirely willing to hear your justification for this matter.</t3098> <t3099>Perhaps you have misunderstood, or been deliberately misled about something concerning me that has caused you to disdain me.</t3099> <t3100>Tell me what has happened, explain the reason for your actions, and then I will be satisfied by making you satisfied.</t3100>
<t3101>Honestly, it pains me to think badly of you; but if I do think so, if I know that what I have believed about you before, that your feelings for me are fake, that your attitude is only intended to deceive, then the sooner it is said, the better.</t3101>
<t3102>My mind at this moment is in a state of terrible uncertainty; I want to forgive him, but surely, whichever direction it takes, it will be more peaceful compared to the suffering I am currently enduring.</t3102>
<t3103>If your feelings are no longer the same as before, you should return my letters and the lock of my hair that you are keeping.</t3103>
<t3104>M.</t3104> <t3105>D.</t3105>
<t3106>Because of Willoughby, Elinor did not want to believe that such affectionate and trusting letters could be responded to in such a manner.</t3106> <t3107>But in condemning him, she did not forget that writing such letters to a young man was not proper at all.</t3107> <t3108>She silently suffered because her reckless younger sister had risked voluntarily providing evidence of feelings that had not been previously confirmed by events, but were later condemned by circumstances.</t3108>
<t3109>When Marianne saw that she had finished reading, her sister explained to her that the letters did not contain anything special except what anyone would write in similar circumstances.</t3109> <t3110>She added:</t3110>
<t3111>- I personally feel that I have made a serious commitment to you, as if the strictest law has bound the two of us together.</t3111>
<t3112>Elinor said:</t3112>
<t3113>- You may believe this, but unfortunately, he doesn't feel the same way.</t3113>
<t3114>- Sister Elinor, he feels that way - week after week he has felt that way.</t3114> <t3115>I know he feels that way.</t3115> <t3116>No matter what has caused him to change now, (and nothing else except dark tricks against me), there was a time when I was as dear to him as my heart desired.</t3116> <t3117>This lock of hair, which he is now willing to give up, was something he earnestly asked me for.</t3117> <t3118>If only you had seen his eyes, his gestures, if only you had heard his voice at that moment! Do you remember the last evening I was with him at Barton? And the morning he parted from me too! When he said it might be many weeks before he saw me again - his anguished expression - how could I ever forget his suffering?</t3118>
<t3119>For a few moments Marianne could not speak; but when the agitation had passed, she added in a steady voice:</t3119>
<t3120>- Sister Elinor, I have been cruelly exploited; but not by Willoughby.</t3120>
<t3121>- Dear Marianne, who else but himself?</t3121> <t3122>Who could have incited him?</t3122>
<t3123>- Because of the whole world, not because of your heart.</t3123> <t3124>I want to believe that everyone who knows me conspired to destroy me in your mind, rather than believe that you intentionally meant to be so cruel.</t3124> <t3125>The woman you wrote about - whoever she is - or in short, anyone except my dear sister, mother, and Edward, could have cruelly given you a false impression of me.</t3125> <t3126>Not mentioning the three dear ones, who else in the world could I suspect besides Willoughby, whose soul I understand very well?</t3126>
<t3127>Elinor could not argue, she only said:</t3127>
<t3128>- My love, anyone who can be your enemy in such a hateful way should be left to be deceived by their malicious victory, so that they may realize how the consciousness of your innocence and goodwill has nobly supported your spirit.</t3128> <t3129>It is the rightful and commendable pride that will stand against such malice.</t3129>
<t3130>Marianne exclaimed:</t3130>
<t3131>- No, no, there is no pride in the suffering I am enduring like this.</t3131> <t3132>I don't care if anyone knows I am in misery.</t3132> <t3133>The victory of seeing me suffer can be made public for the whole world.</t3133> <t3134>Elinor, sister Elinor, those who suffer less can be proud and self-controlled as they wish - they can resist humiliation, or respond to disgrace - but I cannot do that.</t3134> <t3135>I must feel - I must be miserable - and they are free to rejoice in the knowledge that I am suffering.</t3135>
<t3136>- But for you and for me -</t3136>
<t3137>- I will do it for you and for mom more than for myself.</t3137> <t3138>But I have to appear happy when I'm suffering! Oh! Who could demand such a thing?</t3138>
<t3139>Both were silent again.</t3139> <t3140>Elinor thoughtfully walked from the fireplace to the window, and then from the window to the fireplace, without noticing the heat from one or the clear images from the other.</t3140> <t3141>Marianne sat by the foot of the bed, her head resting on a bedpost, picked up Willoughby's letter again, and after shuddering at each sentence, exclaimed:</t3141>
<t3142>- Outrageous! Oh, Willoughby, Willoughby, could this be your letter?</t3142> <t3143>Cruel, cruel - you are unforgivable.</t3143> <t3144>Elinor, nothing can forgive him.</t3144> <t3145>No matter what he has heard about me - he should not have believed it, right?</t3145> <t3146>He should have talked to me, given me a chance to explain, right? (She reads from the letter) "The lock of hair you were willing to give me" - Unforgivable.</t3146> <t3147>Willoughby, where was your heart when you wrote these lines?</t3147> <t3148>Oh! Such cruel insolence! Elinor, can he be justified?</t3148>
<t3149>- No, Marianne, there is no way to justify it.</t3149>
<t3150>- And yet this woman - who knows what her tricks are! How long has she been plotting and how deep are her schemes! Who is she?</t3150> <t3151>Who could she be? Have you heard him mention anyone young and attractive among the girls he knows? Oh! No one, no one - he only talks to me about me.</t3151>
<t3152>One more moment.</t3152> <t3153>Marianne was deeply shaken, saying:</t3153>
<t3154>- Sister Elinor, I have to go home.</t3154> <t3155>I have to return and comfort mother.</t3155> <t3156>Can we go back tomorrow?</t3156>
<t3157>- Tomorrow, Marianne?</t3157>
<t3158>- Yes, why do I have to be here?</t3158> <t3159>I came here only because of Willoughby, and now who cares about me?</t3159> <t3160>Who loves me?</t3160>
<t3161>- We cannot leave tomorrow.</t3161> <t3162>We owe Mrs. Jennings more than just courtesy, and even the most basic politeness does not allow for such a hasty departure.</t3162>
<t3163>- Ah, then maybe one or two days, perhaps; but I can't stay here long, I can't stay to endure the questions and comments from these people.</t3163> <t3164>The Middletons and the Palmers - how could I endure their pity?</t3164> <t3165>Pity from a woman like Lady Middleton! Oh, and how will he talk about this!</t3165>
<t3166>Elinor advised her sister to lie down.</t3166> <t3167>Her younger sister obeyed for a while, but could not find any peace.</t3167> <t3168>In her mental and physical agitation, she kept turning over, still more restless.</t3168> <t3169>Elinor found it difficult to keep her sister resting in bed, and at times feared she might have to reluctantly call the doctor.</t3169> <t3170>But a few drops of lavender water, which the elder sister recommended, proved to be effective.</t3170> <t3171>From this moment until Mrs. Jennings returned, the younger sister lay dozing on the bed.</t3171>
<t3172>Chapter 30</t3172>
<t3173>Mrs. Jennings immediately went to their room, not waiting for an invitation, opened the door and entered with a concerned expression.</t3173> <t3174>She affectionately asked:</t3174>
<t3175>B</t3175>
<t3176>- How is my dear granddaughter feeling?</t3176>
<t3177>Marianne turned away, not answering.</t3177>
<t3178>- Miss Daswood, how is she? Poor thing!</t3178> <t3179>She looks very weak.</t3179> <t3180>Not surprising.</t3180> <t3181>Hey, the news is true.</t3181> <t3182>He will get married soon - such a worthless person! I have no patience with him.</t3182> <t3183>Mrs. Taylor told me half an hour ago, and a friend of Miss Grey informed her, otherwise I wouldn't believe it; and I was shocked.</t3183>
<t3184>"Hey, I said, all I want to say is, if this is true, he has disgustingly taken advantage of a young woman related to me, and deep down I wish his wife would torment his heart.</t3184> <t3185>And I will always say that, dear, believe me.</t3185> <t3186>If I ever get the chance to meet him again, I will give him a piece of my mind."</t3186>
<t3187>"But dear Marianne, there is one consolation: he is not the only young man in the world worth your attention.</t3187> <t3188>With your beauty, you will never lack suitors.</t3188> <t3189>Alright, poor thing!</t3189> <t3190>I don't want to trouble her any further, for she needs to cry to feel relieved.</t3190> <t3191>You know, it's fortunate that the Parry and Sanderson families are coming over tonight; and you will be happy."</t3191>
<t3192>Then she went out, her steps tiptoeing as if she believed that the suffering of her little granddaughter could be worsened by noise.</t3192>
<t3193>Marianne decided to have dinner with them, which surprised her sister.</t3193> <t3194>Elinor even advised her not to.</t3194> <t3195>But "No, I will go down; I will endure it very well, then the commotion around me will subside."</t3195> <t3196>Pleased that her sister had such self-control, though doubting she could sit through the entire meal, Elinor said nothing more.</t3196> <t3197>While Marianne was still lying in bed, her sister adjusted her attire as best as she could, ready to assist her sister into the dining room when called.</t3197>
<t3198>At the dining table, although she still appeared the most miserable, the younger sister ate quite well and seemed calmer than her sister had expected.</t3198> <t3199>If she had forced herself to continue the conversation or paid half the attention to Mrs. Jennings' well-meaning but thoughtless care, she certainly wouldn't have been able to maintain this calm demeanor.</t3199> <t3200>But she did not say a word, and her thoughts kept her oblivious to everything happening in front of her.</t3200>
<t3201>Being fair to Mrs. Jennings' kindness, although she often chattered causing distress and was sometimes eccentric, Elinor responded and politely returned the courtesy on behalf of her sister when her sister did not know what to say.</t3201> <t3202>The kind-hearted lady saw that Marianne was sad and felt that everything was her fault.</t3202> <t3203>Therefore, she treated her with all the indulgence and affection that a parent would give to a beloved child on the last day of a holiday.</t3203> <t3204>Marianne was given the coziest seat near the fireplace, advised to try all the family's special dishes, and comforted with the news of the day.</t3204>
<t3205>If Elinor had not noticed the restraint in Marianne's face, she might have been pleased to see Mrs. Jennings trying to cure the heartbreak with all kinds of sweets and olives, along with a cozy fireplace.</t3205> <t3206>However, as soon as she realized all this care was being continuously lavished on Marianne, the younger sister could not sit any longer.</t3206> <t3207>With a hurried complaint about her suffering and a sign for her sister not to follow, she stood up and quickly walked to her room.</t3207>
<t3208>As soon as she left, Mrs. Jennings exclaimed:</t3208>
<t3209>- Poor thing!</t3209> <t3210>How miserable I feel when I see her!</t3210> <t3211>And I see her finish the meal without using up her wine! And those dried cherries! My God! Nothing can help her.</t3211> <t3212>If I knew what she liked, I would send someone to scour the entire city.</t3212> <t3213>Now, the strangest thing to me is how a man can so wickedly take advantage of such a beautiful girl.</t3213> <t3214>But then, one side has a lot of money, while the other side has almost nothing, dear God! They no longer care about things like loyalty!</t3214>
<t3215>- So that woman - Mrs. Grey, if I remember correctly you called her that - is very wealthy, isn't she?</t3215>
<t3216>- Dear granddaughter, fifty thousand pounds.</t3216> <t3217>Have you met her yet?</t3217> <t3218>They say she is very elegant, fashionably dressed.</t3218> <t3219>I still remember her aunt, Biddy Henshawwe; she married a very wealthy man.</t3219> <t3220>But both families were wealthy.</t3220> <t3221>Fifty thousand pounds!</t3221> <t3222>And according to everyone, only given when needed; because they say he is a spendthrift.</t3222> <t3223>No wonder! Gallivanting around with a two-wheeled carriage and some hunting enthusiasts!</t3223>
<t3224>"Hey, it's not worth mentioning; but when a young man goes to confess his love to a beautiful girl and promises marriage, he shouldn't go back on his word just because he's poor and a rich girl wants to marry him.</t3224> <t3225>In this case, why doesn't he sell his horses, rent out his house, dismiss his servants, and immediately make a complete reform?</t3225> <t3226>I assure you, Miss Marianne could be willing to wait until everything is settled.</t3226> <t3227>But nowadays people don't do that; young men his age never want to give up material pleasures."</t3227>
<t3228>- Do you know what kind of person Miss Grey is?</t3228> <t3229>Do people say she is charming?</t3229>
<t3230>- I have never heard anything bad about her; in fact, I rarely hear her mentioned; except this morning Mrs. Taylor said that the other day Miss Walker implied that she believed Mr. and Mrs. Ellison would not mind letting Miss Grey get married, because she and Mrs. Ellison did not get along.</t3230>
<t3231>- Who are the Ellison family?</t3231>
<t3232>- We are her guardians, dear.</t3232> <t3233>But now she is grown up and can make her own choices.</t3233> <t3234>She sure made an interesting choice!...</t3234>
<t3235>"Where has she gone (pausing for a moment)... I guess your poor sister has retreated to her room to lament alone.</t3235> <t3236>Can't we find something to comfort her?</t3236> <t3237>Poor thing, it seems quite cruel to leave her alone."</t3237>
<t3238>"Hey, gradually we will have a few new friends, so you will be a little happier.</t3238> <t3239>What game shall we play?</t3239> <t3240>I know she hates whist, but isn't there any other game to play?"</t3240>
<t3241>- Madam, this kindness is not very necessary.</t3241> <t3242>I assure you that Marianne will not leave the room again tonight.</t3242> <t3243>I will try to persuade my sister to go to bed early, because I know for sure she needs to rest.</t3243>
<t3244>- Alright, I believe that is the best for her.</t3244> <t3245>Let her order some light food, then go rest.</t3245> <t3246>My God! No wonder she has looked unwell and depressed for the past one or two weeks, because I guess this matter has been on her mind during this time.</t3246> <t3247>And then the letter arrived today and ended it all! Poor thing!</t3247> <t3248>If I had known what the letter said, I certainly wouldn't have joked about it.</t3248> <t3249>But then, you know, how could I have guessed?</t3249> <t3250>I was sure it was nothing but an ordinary love letter, and you know, young people like to be teased.</t3250>
<t3251>"My God! When they learn about this, Sir John and my daughters will be so worried!</t3251> <t3252>If I had enough awareness of myself, I could have visited Conduit Street 1 on the way back and told them.</t3252> <t3253>But I will visit them tomorrow."</t3253>
<t3254>- I believe you don't need to remind Mrs. Palmer and Sir John not to mention Willoughby's name, or even hint at what happened, in front of my sister.</t3254> <t3255>With their cheerful and sociable nature, they would be seen as cruel if they appeared to know something in my sister's presence; and the less they talk to me about the matter, the lighter my mind will be, as my dear aunt can easily agree.</t3255>
<t3256>- My God! Yes, I really should do that.</t3256> <t3257>She will be terribly upset when she hears people gossiping about this; as for her younger sister, I will not say a word to the public.</t3257> <t3258>You see, I didn't say anything throughout the meal.</t3258> <t3259>Sir John or my two daughters also won't speak, because they are all mature and considerate - especially when I remind them, and I will remind them.</t3259> <t3260>As for me, I think the less said about such matters, the better; soon the incident will fade away and be forgotten.</t3260> <t3261>And you know, what's the point of talking about it endlessly?</t3261>
<t3262>- In this matter, gossip only causes more trouble - perhaps more trouble than in similar cases, because there are situations that cannot be made public, for the benefit of everyone.</t3262> <t3263>I need to be fair to Mr. Willoughby in this way - it's not that he broke off a clear engagement with my sister.</t3263>
<t3264>- Oh Lord, dear girl! Don't pretend to defend him.</t3264> <t3265>No clear engagement there!</t3265> <t3266>No engagement, yet he takes your sister to tour the entire Allenham estate, arranging the rooms where they will live together in the future!</t3266>
<t3267>For her sister's sake, Elinor could not push the matter any further, and she hoped it would not be necessary for her to worry about Willoughby; because, although Marianne might lose a lot, he would gain very little from the truth being revealed.</t3267>
<t3268>After a moment of silence, through all her inherent humor, Mrs. Jennings suddenly exclaimed:</t3268>
<t3269>- Hey, dear niece, there's a saying that in every bad luck there's a silver lining, because this is entirely better for Colonel Brandon.</t3269> <t3270>In the end, he will have the younger sister; yes, he will.</t3270> <t3271>Now, remind me, if the two of them don't get married by mid-summer.</t3271> <t3272>Good heavens! How he will chuckle over this news! I wish he would come tonight.</t3272> <t3273>All in all, it will be a better match for your sister.</t3273> <t3274>Two thousand a year without debts or deductions - except for an illegitimate child.</t3274> <t3275>Yes, I had forgotten about the child; but it can be given a small allowance, and then what does it matter?</t3275>
<t3276>"Colonel Brandon's residence at Delaford is situated in a beautiful area, I can tell you.</t3276> <t3277>I've been there myself.</t3277> <t3278>As I said, it is a place with an old-fashioned charm, full of comfort and convenience; quite secluded within its garden walls, with the best fruit trees in the country, and such delicious strawberries in one corner!</t3278> <t3279>My goodness! How full Charlotte and I were when we visited!</t3279> <t3280>And then, there is a dovecote, some very pleasant fish ponds, and a very lovely canal."</t3280>
<t3281>"In short, everything was desirable; moreover, it was close to the church, only a quarter of a mile away from a junction, so life was never dull, because if she just sat under an old yew tree behind the house, she could see the carriages passing by.</t3281> <t3282>Oh, what a wonderful place! A butcher's shop in the village, and the parsonage just a short distance away.</t3282> <t3283>I imagine, a thousand advantages over Barton Park, where one has to go three miles to buy meat, with no neighbors closer than her mother."</t3283>
<t3284>"Alright, I will support the Colonel's spirit as soon as possible.</t3284> <t3285>You know, just a little push and things will progress on their own.</t3285> <t3286>If only we could get Willoughby out of her mind!"</t3286>
<t3287>Elinor said:</t3287>
<t3288>- Yes, ma'am, if we can accomplish this, we will do very well with or without Colonel Brandon.</t3288>
<t3289>And then she stood up, and went to Marianne.</t3289> <t3290>As she had predicted, her sister was in the room, miserably silent, sitting by the extinguished fireplace with no other source of light.</t3290>
<t3291>She only received the request from her younger sister:</t3291>
<t3292>- You should let me be alone.</t3292>
<t3293>Elinor said:</t3293>
<t3294>- I will leave you alone if you go on vacation.</t3294>
<t3295>Due to her stubbornness in suffering and lack of endurance, the younger sister refused to listen.</t3295> <t3296>But the older sister gently and earnestly advised her, and finally, she softened and complied.</t3296> <t3297>Elinor looked at her sister, resting her head on the pillow to try to get the quiet rest she longed for, and then went outside.</t3297>
<t3298>She came to sit in the family room, and soon Mrs. Jennings also arrived, with a glass of wine in her hand.</t3298> <t3299>She spoke as she was entering:</t3299>
<t3300>- My dear niece, I just remembered that there is the finest Constantia wine in the house that we have never tried, so I brought a glass for your sister.</t3300> <t3301>My poor husband! How he loves wine!</t3301> <t3302>Whenever he had a chronic gout attack, he said that wine worked better for him than anything else in the world.</t3302> <t3303>Please bring this glass to your sister.</t3303>
<t3304>Smiling at hearing her suggest the same solution for two different kinds of suffering, Elinor said:</t3304>
<t3305>- Madam, you are so kind! But I have just laid Marianne down on the bed, hoping that she is now asleep; and since I think nothing is better for her than sleep, if you would allow me to be so bold, I will drink this glass.</t3305>
<t3306>Although regretting not arriving five minutes earlier, Mrs. Jennings was still satisfied with the compromise solution.</t3306> <t3307>As she swallowed the liquor, Elinor thought that although its effect on gout was not significant to her now, its efficacy on a disappointed heart was just as beneficial to her as it was to her sister.</t3307>
<t3308>Colonel Brandon arrived while the two were having tea.</t3308> <t3309>From his gesture of looking around the room for Marianne, Elinor immediately thought that he neither expected nor wanted to find her there, and, in short, he knew what had caused her absence.</t3309>
<t3310>Mrs. Jennings did not have the same thought; for as soon as he entered, she went to the tea table where Elinor was sitting, and whispered:</t3310>
<t3311>- You see, the Colonel still looks as stern as ever.</t3311> <t3312>He doesn't know anything about this; dear niece, please tell him.</t3312>
<t3313>He pulled a chair and sat down near her, and through his reassuring expression about his good intentions, he inquired about her sister.</t3313>
<t3314>She said:</t3314>
<t3315>- Marianne is not feeling well.</t3315> <t3316>She has been weak all day, so we persuaded her to lie down and rest.</t3316>
<t3317>He hesitated:</t3317>
<t3318>- So, perhaps what I heard this morning is... somewhat more truthful than I initially wanted to believe.</t3318>
<t3319>- What did you hear?</t3319>
<t3320>- I heard that a man whom I have reason to think... in short, a person I know has made an appointment... but how can I tell you this?</t3320> <t3321>You already know, and since you know well, I don't need to say more.</t3321>
<t3322>Elinor struggled to remain calm:</t3322>
<t3323>- You mean the wedding between Mr. Willoughby and Miss Grey. Yes, we have heard all about it.</t3323> <t3324>It seems to be the day when everything becomes clear, as we learned this morning.</t3324> <t3325>Mr. Willoughby is incomprehensible!</t3325> <t3326>Where did you hear this news?</t3326>
<t3327>- In a stationery shop in the Pall Mall commercial area, where I have a business.</t3327> <t3328>Two women were waiting for their carriage, and one was telling the other about an upcoming wedding, in a voice that did not intend to be discreet, making it impossible for me not to hear everything.</t3328> <t3329>They mentioned the name Willoughby, John Willoughby, several times, which made me listen attentively, and then they clarified that everything had finally been arranged for his wedding with Miss Grey - this was no longer a secret - which would take place in a few weeks, with many details about the preparations and other matters.</t3329> <t3330>I particularly remember one detail, as it helped to clearly identify who was who: right after the wedding, the couple would go to Combe Magna, his house in Somersetshire.</t3330>
<t3331>"I was truly surprised! But I couldn't express how I felt."</t3331> <t3332>"After they left, I inquired and found out that this woman was a Mrs. Ellison, who, as I later learned, was the guardian of Miss Grey."</t3332>
<t3333>- That's right.</t3333> <t3334>But have you heard that Miss Grey has fifty thousand pounds?</t3334> <t3335>Through this, we find the explanation.</t3335>
<t3336>- Probably; but Willoughby is capable... at least I think...</t3336>
<t3337>He paused as if he couldn't believe himself, then continued:</t3337>
<t3338>- And her sister... how has she been...</t3338>
<t3339>- My sister is suffering heavily.</t3339> <t3340>I only hope that the suffering will be as short-lived as the incident itself.</t3340> <t3341>This has been, and is, a cruel disaster.</t3341> <t3342>Until yesterday, I still believed that my sister never doubted his feelings; perhaps even now - but I almost know for sure that he never truly cared for my sister.</t3342> <t3343>He was too deceitful! And, in some ways, it seems his heart is callous.</t3343>
<t3344>- Ah! That's right! But your sister doesn't... I heard you say that... she doesn't think like you, does she?</t3344>
<t3345>- You know my brother's temperament, and you can trust how he will defend him when given the chance.</t3345>
<t3346>He did not answer.</t3346> <t3347>After that, when the tea was cleared away and the cards were laid out, the two had to end their conversation.</t3347> <t3348>Having been delighted to observe them talking, Mrs. Jennings anticipated seeing the effect of Miss Dashwood's exchange in the lively demeanor of Colonel Brandon, like that of a young man, full of hope and happiness.</t3348> <t3349>But she was surprised to see that he remained solemn and pensive the entire evening.</t3349>
<t3350>Chapter 31</t3350>
<t3351>After a night of sleeping more than expected, Marianne woke up the next morning with the same sense of anguish as when she was about to fall asleep.</t3351>
<t3352>S</t3352>
<t3353>Elinor encouraged her sister in every possible way to confide her feelings; and before breakfast was ready, the two sisters had discussed the matter repeatedly; through Elinor's steadfast thoughts and loving advice, and Marianne's passionate emotions and inconsistent opinions - everything was as before.</t3353> <t3354>Sometimes the younger sister believed Willoughby to be as unfortunate and innocent as herself, while at other times she lost all comfort in the possibility of forgiving him.</t3354> <t3355>At one moment she was completely indifferent to all remarks from others, at another she avoided everyone, and in the next moment, she countered with all her fervor.</t3355>
<t3356>However, she accepted one thing, which was to avoid Mrs. Jennings' presence if possible, and to remain silent when she had to endure her.</t3356> <t3357>Her heart had hardened towards Mrs. Jennings, so she did not want to believe that Mrs. Jennings was intruding into her sorrows out of sympathy.</t3357> <t3358>She exclaimed:</t3358>
<t3359>- No, no, there's no way she could understand.</t3359> <t3360>Kindness does not come from empathy; her goodwill is not due to sensitivity.</t3360> <t3361>She just wants to gossip; she likes you only because you are a source for her idle chatter.</t3361>
<t3362>Elinor did not need to wait to hear such things to determine that her sister was unfair in judging others.</t3362> <t3363>Her sister had formed a habit of irritability, placing exaggerated importance on the subtleties of feeling and the niceties of polite behavior.</t3363> <t3364>Just like half of humanity, if more than half of human qualities are shrewdness and goodwill, Marianne did not appear reasonable and honest with them, despite her superior abilities and outstanding temperament.</t3364> <t3365>She demanded that others share her own views and feelings, and judged their motives by the immediate effect their actions had on her.</t3365> <t3366>Thus, there was a situation that occurred while the two sisters retired to their room after breakfast, which made her further undervalue Mrs. Jennings' heart; because, through her fault, there was new pain for her sister, even though it was merely due to Mrs. Jennings' excessive goodwill in her bluntness.</t3366>
<t3367>With a letter in her outstretched hand and a radiant, smiling face intended to bring comfort, she entered the room and said:</t3367>
<t3368>- Now, my dear girl, I bring you this which I am sure will please you.</t3368>
<t3369>Marianne had heard enough.</t3369> <t3370>She immediately imagined that this was a letter from Willoughby, full of affection and regret, explaining everything that had happened, satisfying her, convincing her; then she immediately envisioned Willoughby himself following, eagerly running in, kneeling at her feet, confirming with his earnest eyes everything he had written in the letter.</t3370> <t3371>Such hopes were shattered in an instant by the next moment.</t3371> <t3372>Before her was her mother's handwriting, which had been eagerly awaited until now.</t3372> <t3373>In the sharp disappointment that followed the joy of something more than hope, she felt as if she had never suffered so much.</t3373>
<t3374>No words - within her most eloquent moments of happiness - could describe how cruel Mrs. Jennings was; and now she could only reproach Mrs. Jennings through tears with intense emotion.</t3374> <t3375>However, the reproach was not understood by the recipient; for after many expressions of sympathy, she left still talking to her about the letter that would bring comfort.</t3375>
<t3376>But when calm enough to read, the letter brought very little comfort.</t3376> <t3377>Willoughby filled every page.</t3377> <t3378>Still confident about their engagement and still fervently relying on his fidelity, the mother only paid attention to Elinor's suggestion to urge Marianne to be more open with them.</t3378> <t3379>This - through such love for her, such affection for Willoughby, such belief in their happiness - made Marianne sob throughout the reading of the letter.</t3379>
<t3380>Now she was eager to return home.</t3380> <t3381>Her mother was dearer to her than ever - even dearer because of her mistaken and excessive trust in Willoughby, and she felt an overwhelming urgency to return home.</t3381>
<t3382>Unable to decide whether staying in London or returning to Barton would be better for Marianne, Elinor only advised her sister to be patient and wait until they knew their mother's wishes; and finally, the younger sister agreed.</t3382>
<t3383>Mrs. Jennings left the house earlier than usual, as she did not feel at ease while the Middleton and Palmer families had not yet expressed their grief as she had.</t3383> <t3384>Resolutely refusing Elinor's offer to accompany her, she went out alone for the entire morning.</t3384> <t3385>With a heavy heart, Elinor felt the pain she would convey, realizing through the letter her mother sent to Marianne that she still did not fully understand her intentions.</t3385> <t3386>Then she sat down to write another letter to her mother about what had happened and earnestly sought guidance for the future.</t3386> <t3387>Marianne had entered the family room while Mrs. Jennings was away, sitting motionless watching Elinor write the letter, following the pen's movement, lamenting such arduous work, and lamenting even more about its impact on their mother.</t3387>
<t3388>The two sisters sat together like that for about a quarter of an hour, then Marianne - with nerves that couldn't bear any sudden noise - was startled by a knock on the door.</t3388>
<t3389>Elinor exclaimed:</t3389>
<t3390>- Who could it be? It's still too early.</t3390> <t3391>I think we are safe.</t3391>
<t3392>Marianne went to the window, then said irritably:</t3392>
<t3393>- That's Colonel Brandon.</t3393> <t3394>We are never at peace with him.</t3394>
<t3395>- He will not come in, because Mrs. Jennings is away.</t3395>
<t3396>Marianne said, as she turned back to her room:</t3396>
<t3397>- You won't believe this.</t3397> <t3398>A man who has nothing to do with his time has no sense when infringing on the time of others.</t3398>
<t3399>Even though it lacked fairness and was full of misconceptions, Marianne's guess was correct: Colonel Brandon did indeed come in.</t3399> <t3400>Elinor believed that he came out of concern for Marianne, seeing that concern in his troubled and gloomy demeanor and in his brief yet worried inquiries. She could not forgive her sister for disregarding him in such a manner.</t3400>
<t3401>After the initial greeting, he said:</t3401>
<t3402>- I met Mrs. Jennings on Bond Street; she encouraged me to come.</t3402> <t3403>I am easily encouraged, because I thought there was a chance I might meet you alone; and I very much wanted that.</t3403> <t3404>My purpose... my desire... my only desire... I hope - I believe so - is to offer comfort, I shouldn't say comfort... not comfort at this moment... but faith, eternal faith for your sister's heart.</t3404> <t3405>My affection for her, for you, for your mother... please allow me to demonstrate, by recounting some situations where nothing but very sincere affection - nothing but a fervent desire to be helpful; I think I have proven myself, although I have spent many hours convincing myself where I did right, is there any reason to fear I did wrong?</t3405>
<t3406>He paused.</t3406>
<t3407>Elinor said:</t3407>
<t3408>- I understand your point.</t3408> <t3409>You must be referring to Mr. Willoughby, to expose more of his character to me.</t3409> <t3410>This is the best friendly act to let Marianne see the truth.</t3410> <t3411>You will immediately have my appreciation for providing such information, and my sister's appreciation will come in time.</t3411> <t3412>Please, kindly tell me.</t3412>
<t3413>- You will listen; and, to be brief, when I left Barton last October... but you will not understand.</t3413> <t3414>I need to go back to the past. Miss Daswood, you will find me very clumsy when telling the story, I don't know where to begin.</t3414> <t3415>I believe it is necessary to tell a little about myself, and it will be brief.</t3415> <t3416>Regarding this matter, I do not want to be long-winded.</t3416>
<t3417>He sighed heavily as he spoke up to this point, paused for a moment to reminisce, and then, with another sigh, continued:</t3417>
<t3418>- Perhaps you have not entirely forgotten our conversation (not that it might have made any particular impression on you) - the conversation between you and me at Barton Park, during a ball - in which I alluded to a woman I once knew, who in some respects resembled your sister Marianne.</t3418>
<t3419>Elinor replied:</t3419>
<t3420>- Yes, I haven't forgotten about this.</t3420>
<t3421>He seemed pleased that she still remembered, and added:</t3421>
<t3422>- If I am not mistaken due to uncertainties or biased by soft-hearted recollections, the two are very similar in both soul and body.</t3422> <t3423>With the same warm heart, the same lively spirit.</t3423> <t3424>This woman is one of the closest people to me, orphaned from a young age, taken under my father's care.</t3424> <t3425>The two of us are nearly the same age, and from our earliest years, we were playmates.</t3425> <t3426>I cannot remember a time when I did not love Eliza; and as we grew up, my feelings for her were such that, although, perhaps judging by the solitary and sternly joyless circumstances now, she might think I never knew how to feel.</t3426> <t3427>I believe her feelings for me were as fervent as her sister's for Willoughby, equally unfortunate, though for different reasons.</t3427>
<t3428>"At the age of seventeen, she no longer had any relationship with me.</t3428> <t3429>She got married - married my brother against her will.</t3429> <t3430>She had a large fortune, and our family's estate was heavily in debt.</t3430> <t3431>My brother was not worthy of her; he didn't even love her.</t3431> <t3432>I had hoped that her feelings for me would lift her through the difficulties, and for a time, they did.</t3432> <t3433>But eventually, because she endured such terrible treatment, her miserable situation extinguished all her resolve, and although she had promised me nothing, I was somehow blindly hopeful!"</t3433>
<t3434>"I haven't told you how this came about.</t3434> <t3435>In just a few hours, we were going to elope to Scotland.</t3435> <t3436>Her maid betrayed us - or foolishly - revealed the news.</t3436> <t3437>I was sent to live with a distant relative; she was forbidden from having any freedom, any communication, any enjoyment; until my father felt that everyone had understood his warning.</t3437> <t3438>I had too much faith in her resilience, and the disappointment was heavy; but if only she had a happy marriage, because at that time I was young, a few months might have eased my pain, or at least now I wouldn't have to lament.</t3438> <t3439>However, that was not the case.</t3439> <t3440>My brother did not love her; his pleasures were not as normal as people thought, and from the very beginning, he treated her badly."</t3440>
<t3441>"The consequences of this matter, on such a young and vibrant mind, as inexperienced as hers, are inevitable.</t3441> <t3442>At first, she endured all the suffering herself; she might have been happy if she hadn't lived to overcome the regrets that memories of me evoked.</t3442> <t3443>But with a husband like that, ultimately lacking patience, without a friend to advise or restrain her (for my father lived only a few months after their wedding, and I was serving in the regiment in the East Indies), one might wonder if she could have stood firm?</t3443> <t3444>Perhaps, if I had stayed in England... but I intended to foster the happiness of both by staying away from her for many years."</t3444>
<t3445>In the most tremulous voice, he continued:</t3445>
<t3446>- The shock that her marriage caused me was just a trivial burden - nothing compared to when I heard the news of her divorce about two years later.</t3446> <t3447>This is what made me even sadder - even now, the memory of what caused me such pain...</t3447>
<t3448>He could not say more, suddenly stood up and walked around the room.</t3448> <t3449>Elinor could not say anything, moved by his story, even more moved by his suffering.</t3449> <t3450>He saw her concern, approached her, took her hand, then held it tightly and kissed it with grateful respect.</t3450> <t3451>The effort to remain silent for a few minutes helped him continue with calmness:</t3451>
<t3452>- Nearly three years after that unfortunate time, I returned to England.</t3452> <t3453>The first thing I was concerned with when I just got back was, of course, to look for her, but the search was both hopeless and miserable.</t3453> <t3454>I could only trace her whereabouts up to her first lover, with every reason to fear that she had left him and plunged deeper into a life of sin.</t3454> <t3455>The legally mandated support was not enough to provide her with an estate, nor enough for her to be comfortable, and then my brother informed me that a few months ago the right to receive the support had been transferred to another person.</t3455> <t3456>He guessed - and could guess calmly - that because she had spent extravagantly and then fallen into destitution, she had to transfer part of the right to receive support to get immediate assistance.</t3456>
<t3457>"However, finally, six months after I returned to England, I found her.</t3457> <t3458>Out of affection for an old servant of mine who was now in dire straits, I visited him at the debtor's prison.</t3458> <t3459>Imprisoned there as well was my unfortunate sister.</t3459> <t3460>She had changed so much... pale... emaciated by all sorts of hardships! I could hardly believe that the gaunt and sickly figure before me was all that remained of a lovely, vibrant, healthy young woman whom I had once adored."</t3460>
<t3461>"How I endured when I embraced her - but I had no right to hurt her feelings by expressing it - I had already made her very emotional.</t3461> <t3462>By all appearances, she was in the final stages of tuberculosis and so... yes, in such circumstances, this was the greatest comfort for me.</t3462> <t3463>Life could do nothing for her, except to give her more time to better prepare for death; and she got more time.</t3463> <t3464>I sent her to stay in a rented room, and she was properly cared for.</t3464> <t3465>I visited her every day during her short remaining life.</t3465> <t3466>I was by her side in her final moments."</t3466>
<t3467>He paused to collect himself.</t3467> <t3468>Elinor expressed her feelings in gentle concern for the fate of his unfortunate friend.</t3468>
<t3469>He continued:</t3469>
<t3470>- I hope your sister is not offended when I think of the similarities between her and my wretched, disgraceful relative.</t3470> <t3471>Their fates, their fortunes cannot be the same.</t3471> <t3472>If her naturally sweet temperament were protected by a stronger mind, or a happier marriage, you would see she would have become a completely different person.</t3472> <t3473>But where do these things lead?</t3473> <t3474>It seems I have made you sorrowful without purpose.</t3474>
<t3475>"Ah! Miss Daswood... a story like this... not spoken of in fourteen years... if spoken of aimlessly, it is very sad!</t3475> <t3476>I will be more self-controlled - more concise.</t3476> <t3477>She left me to take care of her only child, a little girl, the offspring of her first sinful relationship, who was three years old at the time.</t3477> <t3478>She loved the child very much, always keeping her by her side.</t3478> <t3479>This was a very precious trust given to me, and I would have been very happy to accept it in the most serious sense by personally taking charge of the girl's education, if I had the convenient circumstances.</t3479> <t3480>But I had no family, no home at that time; therefore, I had to send my little Eliza to a boarding school."</t3480>
<t3481>"I visited the girl whenever I had the chance, and after my brother passed away (five years ago, leaving me the family estate), she came to visit me at Delaford. I called her a distant relative, but I was well aware that people suspected I had a closer relationship with her.</t3481> <t3482>At that time, three years ago (she had just turned fourteen), I took her out of school and placed her under the guardianship of a highly esteemed woman residing in Dorsetshire.</t3482> <t3483>This woman also cared for four or five other girls of similar age, and for two years I had every reason to be satisfied with the girl's life."</t3483>
<t3484>"But last February, nearly twelve months ago, the girl suddenly disappeared.</t3484> <t3485>Following her earnest wish, I had allowed her (carelessly, as it has since shown) to go to Bath with a young friend of hers who was taking care of her father there at the time.</t3485> <t3486>I knew he was a very kind man, and I had a good opinion of his daughter - better than her true nature, for through her discreet attitude in this stubborn and reckless matter, she did not want to say anything, did not provide any clues, although she certainly knew everything.</t3486> <t3487>This man - the girl's father - is a well-meaning but not very perceptive person, I believe he could not really provide information; for he was confined to the house while the two girls roamed the streets and made friends with anyone they liked.</t3487> <t3488>He tried to convince me - as he himself believed - that his daughter was completely uninvolved in the matter."</t3488>
<t3489>"In short, I was not informed of anything other than the fact that the girl had left.</t3489> <t3490>In the eighteen months that followed, what remained could only be guessed.</t3490> <t3491>What I think - what I fear - can be imagined; that is also what causes me anguish."</t3491>
<t3492>Elinor exclaimed:</t3492>
<t3493>- Oh my God! Could it be... could it be Willoughby!...</t3493>
<t3494>He continued:</t3494>
<t3495>- The first news about the girl reached me through a letter from the girl herself, last October.</t3495> <t3496>The letter was forwarded from Delaford, and I received it exactly on the morning we were preparing to go to Whitwell. This is the reason I had to leave Barton so suddenly, which I know seemed strange to everyone at the time, and offended some people.</t3496>
<t3497>"I guess when Mr. Willoughby seemed to reproach me for being rude in breaking up the gathering, he could hardly imagine that I was called away to help someone he had made miserable and distressed; but even if he knew, what difference would it make? Would he be any less lively or less happy with your sister's smiles?"</t3497> <t3498>No, he did it - something no one would do if they could think of others.</t3498> <t3499>He abandoned the young and innocent girl he had seduced, leaving her in extreme misery, with no decent place to stay, no help, no friends, not knowing his address! He parted from her, promising to return.</t3499> <t3500>He did not return, did not write to her, did not provide for her."</t3500>
<t3501>Elinor exclaimed:</t3501>
<t3502>- It's beyond imagination.</t3502>
<t3503>- Your status is now placed before her - luxurious, debauched, and worse than both.</t3503> <t3504>When I had learned everything - for I had known for many weeks - imagine what I thought when I saw your sister still friendly with him as ever; and when I heard the news that your sister was going to marry him, imagine what I thought for her.</t3504>
<t3505>"Last week when I came here and saw you alone, I came with the intention of finding out the truth; although I was not sure what I would do once I knew the painful truth.</t3505> <t3506>At that time, my behavior must have seemed strange to you, but now you understand why.</t3506> <t3507>Making both of you suffer, feeling deceived like that; seeing your sister... but what could I do?</t3507> <t3508>I did not hope to prevent the marriage, and sometimes I thought your sister's influence might reform him."</t3508>
<t3509>"But now, after such disgraceful exploitation, who can say what you are planning with her sister.</t3509> <t3510>However, regardless of what these plans are, when her sister compares her situation to the miserable condition of my poor Eliza, when she knows about the desperate and hopeless state of that poor girl, now her sister must feel - and will surely feel later - that her own situation is still fortunate.</t3510> <t3511>Her sister should imagine herself as that girl; with feelings for him still deep - as deep as her own feelings - with thoughts torn by self-reproach, and these thoughts lingering for a lifetime.</t3511> <t3512>Surely this comparison will be useful for her sister.</t3512> <t3513>She will see that her own sufferings are nothing.</t3513> <t3514>This is merely due to misguided actions, not disgrace.</t3514> <t3515>On the contrary, these sufferings should make each friend of her sister a better friend.</t3515> <t3516>The concern for her sister's misfortune, and the respect for enduring this misfortune, should strengthen all bonds."</t3516>
<t3517>"However, you should consider carefully when conveying to her what I have told you.</t3517> <t3518>Surely you are the one who knows best what the impact will be; but if I did not sincerely believe from the bottom of my heart that I could help, that I could soothe your sister's regrets, I would not have endured the hardship of bothering you with this sorrowful story in my family - which seems to aim at elevating myself and belittling others."</t3518>
<t3519>Elinor sincerely thanked him, while also expressing hope that she could help Marianne by conveying what she had heard.</t3519> <t3520>She said:</t3520>
<t3521>- I have endured more pain from my sister trying to forgive him than from anything else.</t3521> <t3522>This has caused my sister's mind more turmoil than simply condemning his roguish nature completely.</t3522> <t3523>Now, although she will suffer greatly, I am certain that before long she will feel more at ease.</t3523>
<t3524>After a moment of silence, she continued:</t3524>
<t3525>- Have you seen Mr. Willoughby again since you parted ways with him at Barton?</t3525>
<t3526>He responded seriously:</t3526>
<t3527>- I met once.</t3527> <t3528>An unavoidable encounter.</t3528>
<t3529>Surprised by his attitude, Elinor looked at him anxiously:</t3529>
<t3530>- What! You met him to...</t3530>
<t3531>- I couldn't meet him any other way.</t3531> <t3532>Eliza confessed to me - though very hesitantly - the name of her lover; and when he returned to the city, about half a month after I came back, we arranged to meet, so he could defend himself, and I could punish his conduct.</t3532> <t3533>Neither of us were injured, and thus the meeting was kept secret.</t3533>
<t3534>Elinor sighed thinking about the action that required such an excessive measure, but for a man and also a soldier, she felt it was not right to blame him.</t3534>
<t3535>After a moment of silence, Colonel Brandon said:</t3535>
<t3536>- This is the unfortunate similarity between the fate of the mother and the daughter! And I did not fulfill my responsibility!</t3536>
<t3537>- Is she still in the city?</t3537>
<t3538>- No.</t3538> <t3539>Right after she had just temporarily recovered - because I met her near the time of childbirth - I took her and the baby to the countryside, and she stayed there.</t3539>
<t3540>Then, remembering that he had kept Elinor away from her sister for quite a while, he took his leave. Once again, she thanked him sincerely, and he departed with her full sympathy and respect.</t3540>
<t3541>Chapter 32</t3541>
<t3542>When Miss Dashwood recounted the details of the conversation to her sister, the effect was not entirely as she had hoped to see.</t3542> <t3543>It was not that Marianne appeared to doubt any part of the story, for she listened attentively in calmness and accepted it without objection or comment, not attempting to defend Willoughby, and through her tears seemed to feel that he could not be defended.</t3543> <t3544>Elinor saw that her sister's demeanor indicated an awareness of guilt had entered her mind, and was also pleased to see the result as her sister no longer avoided Colonel Brandon when he visited, but even voluntarily conversed with him in a respectful and sympathetic manner.</t3544> <t3545>Her sister's spirits were also less agitated and tormented than before.</t3545>
<t3546>K</t3546>
<t3547>However, Marianne did not feel any less miserable.</t3547> <t3548>Her mind became stable, but stable in despondency and melancholy.</t3548> <t3549>She felt the loss of Willoughby's character more heavily than the loss of his affection.</t3549> <t3550>His seduction and abandonment of Miss Williams, the poor girl's misery, and the suspicion of his intentions that might have once dominated her—all together haunted her mind to the extent that she could not express her feelings even to Elinor.</t3550> <t3551>Nurturing her sorrow in silence, she caused her sister more pain than if she had confessed this sorrow in the most open and frequent manner.</t3551>
<t3552>The thoughts and words of Mrs. Dashwood when receiving and replying to Elinor's letter merely echoed the thoughts and words of her two daughters.</t3552> <t3553>It was a disappointment as painful as Marianne's, and an indignation even stronger than Elinor's.</t3553> <t3554>Her letters followed one another, recounting all the suffering she endured and her reflections, comforting Marianne, and urging her daughter to bravely endure this misfortune.</t3554> <t3555>Marianne's sorrow was indeed heavy, for her mother to speak of bravery!</t3555> <t3556>The source of these regrets must feel ashamed and humiliated: she should have wished her daughter not to be so indulgent!</t3556>
<t3557>Although her daughter wanted to be comfortable, Mrs. Dashwood decided that it would be better for Marianne at this time to stay anywhere except Barton, where every view would most strongly and painfully remind her of the past, always putting Willoughby before her eyes, as if she constantly saw him there.</t3557> <t3558>Therefore, she advised her two daughters not to shorten their visit to Mrs. Jennings' house, which was planned to last at least five or six weeks, although it was never precisely determined.</t3558> <t3559>Unlike Barton, there were many types of activities here, many places to visit, and many social connections, which Mrs. Dashwood hoped would, over time, distract Marianne and make her find interest, even unintentionally, or even feel joy.</t3559>
<t3560>Regarding the risk of encountering Willoughby again, the mother considered that whether in the city or the countryside, at least she would be equally at peace, because all those who claimed to be her acquaintances would certainly cease to communicate with him.</t3560> <t3561>Even if she tried, she could never create an opportunity for the two to meet; even by accident, she could never allow them to meet unexpectedly.</t3561> <t3562>The chance of them meeting in the crowds of London was even less than if they retreated to Barton, where he might be compelled to appear before her when returning to Allenham after his wedding.</t3562> <t3563>At first, Mrs. Dashwood considered this only a possibility, but eventually thought it was certain.</t3563>
<t3564>She had another reason for wanting the two girls to stay: a letter from her eldest son informed her that he and his wife would be going to the city in mid-February, and she thought the two girls should occasionally visit their half-brother.</t3564>
<t3565>Marianne promised to heed her mother's advice, so she obediently complied; even though the advice differed from what she had hoped and expected; even though she felt the advice was completely wrong, based on mistaken reasoning.</t3565> <t3566>She also thought that when her mother forced her to extend the trip to London, her suffering could not be alleviated: she was not close to her mother's sympathy, and she could not rest because she had to socialize.</t3566> <t3567>However, she had great consolation in knowing that although the advice had unintended consequences for her, it would bring good fortune to her sister.</t3567>
<t3568>On the other hand, Elinor guessed she couldn't avoid meeting Edward, so she consoled herself by thinking that even though she might find herself in an unpleasant situation, her sister would be in a better position than returning to Barton right now.</t3568> <t3569>She still carefully shielded her sister from having to hear anyone mention Willoughby.</t3569>
<t3570>Marianne was at peace without knowing about this, because both Mrs. Jennings, Sir John, and even Miss Palmer avoided mentioning him in her presence.</t3570> <t3571>Elinor wished this attitude could be applied to her as well, but it was not possible; and every day she was forced to listen to their comments to the point where she became exasperated with all three of them.</t3571>
<t3572>Mr. John couldn't control himself. "A person for whom he always has a reason to think well!</t3572> <t3573>What a funny guy!</t3573> <t3574>He doesn't believe there's anyone in England who rides a horse more recklessly! This is an inexplicable matter.</t3574> <t3575>In his heart, he wanted the devil to take him away.</t3575> <t3576>He wouldn't say another word to him, meet him where he could be met! No, not if he had to sneak around in Barton, and they had to wait for two whole hours.</t3576> <t3577>Such a scoundrel! A deceitful dog!</t3577> <t3578>During their last meeting, he had offered to give him a puppy! That was the end of it all!"</t3578>
<t3579>Miss Palmer was equally angry in her own way. "She immediately decided not to associate with him, and felt fortunate never to have known him.</t3579> <t3580>In her heart, she wished Combe Magna was not so close to Cleveland; but this did not matter, as the distance was too great to visit.</t3580> <t3581>She hated him so much that she resolved never to mention his name again, and she would tell everyone she met that he was a scoundrel."</t3581>
<t3582>The rest of Miss Palmer's sympathetic feelings were revealed when she inquired into every detail through her ability about the upcoming marriage, and she informed Elinor.</t3582> <t3583>Then she mentioned which workshop was building the new carriage, which artist was painting Mr. Willoughby's portrait, and which warehouse was storing Miss Grey's dress samples.</t3583>
<t3584>The indifferent attitude in the calm and politeness of Lady Middleton helped Elinor's spirit feel at ease, instead of being oppressed by the noisy kindness of others.</t3584> <t3585>It was indeed very comfortable for her to know for sure that at least one person in the group of friends did not show concern, someone who met her without being curious about the news, or worried about her sister's health.</t3585>
<t3586>For many others, each occasional comment made in various situations often exceeds the true meaning that should be conveyed.</t3586> <t3587>Sometimes she grew weary of their bustling condolences, leading her to value a well-mannered character - rather than a cheerful temperament - as necessary to bring comfort to her and her sister.</t3587>
<t3588>Mrs. Middleton expressed her feelings about the matter approximately once a day, or twice if the topic was discussed more, by saying "It truly is shocking".</t3588> <t3589>Through her continuous yet gentle venting, she could not only initially meet the Dashwood sisters without any emotion, but also meet them again without remembering a word about the matter.</t3589> <t3590>After having elevated the dignity of her gender and voiced her criticism of the wrongdoings of the other, she felt free to look after the interests of the people she gathered around.</t3590> <t3591>Therefore, she insisted (though against Sir John's wishes) that since Miss Willoughby would soon be a refined and elegant lady, she should leave her calling card for her immediately after the wedding.</t3591>
<t3592>Miss Dashwood cheerfully received the delicate inquiries, not intruding into Colonel Brandon's privacy.</t3592> <t3593>He was permitted to discuss intimately the disappointment of her younger sister, through the friendly enthusiasm he tried to soothe, and they always conversed in private.</t3593> <t3594>His main reward for revealing past sorrows and present humiliations was Marianne's occasional compassionate glance towards him, and her gentle voice whenever (though not often) she was compelled - or perhaps compelled herself - to converse with him.</t3594> <t3595>These things made him believe that his efforts had increased her goodwill towards him, and these things helped Elinor hope that the goodwill would progress further in the future.</t3595>
<t3596>But Mrs. Jennings did not know what had transpired between the two, only noticing that the Colonel remained as stern as ever.</t3596> <t3597>She thought it impossible to entice him to speak out, nor could she entrust the girl to broach the subject with him.</t3597> <t3598>After two days, she began to think that instead of on the Summer Solstice 1, they might have to wait until Michaelmas 2 for him and her granddaughter to get married.</t3598> <t3599>After a week, she thought there could be no wedding between the two.</t3599> <t3600>The deep sympathy between the Colonel and Miss Daswood seemed to indicate that the honor of owning the mulberry tree, the canal, and the yew grove would pass to the elder sister; and for a time, Mrs. Jennings no longer thought about Mr. Ferrars.</t3600>
<t3601>At the beginning of February, within a fortnight after receiving Willoughby's letter, Elinor had the painful duty of informing her sister that he had married.</t3601> <t3602>She had carefully taken it upon herself to deliver the news as soon as she learned the wedding had concluded, not wanting Marianne to hear about it through the newspapers she eagerly read every morning.</t3602>
<t3603>The Willoughby couple left the city right after getting married.</t3603> <t3604>Since there was now no risk of her sister encountering either of them, Elinor hoped to persuade her sister to go out as before, because her sister had confined herself to the house since the first shock.</t3604>
<t3605>At this time, the two Steele sisters, after staying at their cousin's house in Bartlett's Building, Holburn, visited their more important relatives in Conduit Street and Berkeley Street, and were warmly received.</t3605>
<t3606>Elinor only felt uncomfortable when she met the two of them again.</t3606> <t3607>Their presence always caused her unease, and she did not know how to appear truly amiable in response to Lucy's enthusiastic joy at seeing her still in the city.</t3607>
<t3608>Ms. Lucy repeated, emphasizing important words:</t3608>
<t3609>- If I hadn't seen you still here, I would have been quite disappointed.</t3609> <t3610>But I always thought I should be prepared for disappointment.</t3610> <t3611>I was almost certain you would stay in London for a while; although in Boston you told me, remember, that you wouldn't stay for more than a month.</t3611> <t3612>But at that time, I thought it was very likely you would change your mind when the time came.</t3612> <t3613>It's really a pity to leave before your sister and brother arrive.</t3613> <t3614>And now, surely you won't have any urgent reason to leave.</t3614> <t3615>I'm surprisingly happy that you didn't stick to your plan.</t3615>
<t3616>Elinor understood her meaning very well, and had to make every effort to remain calm to show that she had not taken offense.</t3616>
<t3617>Mrs. Jennings said:</t3617>
<t3618>- Hey, my dear niece, how was the trip?</t3618>
<t3619>Ms. Steele quickly beamed:</t3619>
<t3620>- No need to take bus route 3, rest assured; we used a station wagon for the entire trip, and there was a handsome young gentleman taking care of us.</t3620> <t3621>Dr. Davies was also going to the city, so we thought we should go with him by station wagon; he was very gentle and paid more for the fare than we did.</t3621>
<t3622>Mrs. Jennings exclaimed:</t3622>
<t3623>- There, there! How interesting! I assure you ladies, the Doctor is still single.</t3623>
<t3624>Ms. Steele gave a fake smile:</t3624>
<t3625>- Again! Everyone laughs at me like that about the Doctor, but I can't figure out why.</t3625> <t3626>My cousins say they are sure I have made a conquest; but as for me, I never think about him from one hour to the next.</t3626> <t3627>"Good heavens! Your prince charming has arrived, Nancy," my cousin said one day when she saw a man crossing the street towards our house.</t3627> <t3628>"Clearly my prince charming!", I said, "I can't figure out who you mean.</t3628> <t3629>The Doctor is not my prince charming."</t3629>
<t3630>- Hey, hey, it sounds great - but I don't believe it - it's the Doctor himself, I know it.</t3630>
<t3631>Her cousin was lively:</t3631>
<t3632>- No, really! And I ask you to correct it if you ever hear such a thing.</t3632>
<t3633>Mrs. Jennings assured that she would certainly not correct to create excitement for her, which made Miss Steele completely delighted.</t3633>
<t3634>After a momentary pause in the hostile undertones, Lucy resumed her attack:</t3634>
<t3635>- Miss Daswood, I suppose you will stay at your sister's house when they come to the city.</t3635>
<t3636>- No, I don't think we will be there.</t3636>
<t3637>- Ah, yes, I'm sure she will be there.</t3637>
<t3638>Elinor did not want to entertain her by denying further.</t3638>
<t3639>- It's so nice that Mrs. Daswood allowed the two girls to go together for such a long time!</t3639>
<t3640>Mrs. Jennings interjected:</t3640>
<t3641>- So long! What, your visit has just begun.</t3641>
<t3642>Lucy was rendered speechless by her grandmother.</t3642>
<t3643>Ms. Steele said:</t3643>
<t3644>- Miss Daswood, we regret not being able to meet your sister.</t3644> <t3645>I regret that she is not well.</t3645>
<t3646>When they went in, Marriane had already left the room.</t3646>
<t3647>- You are very kind.</t3647> <t3648>My younger sister also regrets not being able to see you again, but she has recently been suffering from headaches, so she cannot meet or chat.</t3648>
<t3649>- Oh, my God, how pitiful!</t3649> <t3650>But for old friends like Lucy and me! I think she can meet us, and I assure you we won't utter a word.</t3650>
<t3651>Through all her cleverness, Elinor declined the offer.</t3651> <t3652>Her sister was probably lying in bed, wearing her nightgown, and therefore couldn't come down to meet the two ladies.</t3652>
<t3653>Ms. Steele exclaimed:</t3653>
<t3654>- Hey, if possible, we could go up and meet her.</t3654>
<t3655>Elinor began to think that this insolent attitude was beyond her tolerance, but she did not have to restrain herself because Lucy had sharply reproached her sister.</t3655> <t3656>Although her words were not gentle, in many cases, Lucy often had the power to restrain her sister's behavior.</t3656>
<t3657>Chapter 33</t3657>
<t3658>After some resistance, Marianne complied with her sister's entreaties, and one morning agreed to go out for half an hour with her sister and Mrs. Jennings.</t3658> <t3659>However, she set a clear condition that they would not visit anyone, and would do nothing more than accompany the two to Gray's shop on Sackville Street, so that Elinor could bargain to exchange some antique jewelry for their mother.</t3659>
<t3660>S</t3660>
<t3661>When the lady stopped at the door, Mrs. Jennings noticed a woman standing at the end of the road whom she was supposed to meet; and since she had no business at Gray's shop, they agreed that while the two young ladies took care of their shopping, she would go meet her friend and return to them afterwards.</t3661>
<t3662>When stepping up the stairs, the two Daswood sisters saw many people inside and no one available to attend to them, so they had to wait.</t3662> <t3663>They didn't know what else to do but sit down at the end of the counter, hoping to be served quickly.</t3663> <t3664>There was only one man standing there, and perhaps Elinor was not without hope that he would act courteously and finish his business quickly.</t3664> <t3665>But his discerning eyes and delicate aesthetic sense proved to be overly courteous.</t3665> <t3666>He was inquiring about buying a toothpick holder for himself, then examining and considering all the boxes on display in the shop regarding size, shape, and patterns for fifteen minutes.</t3666> <t3667>After he was satisfied with his creative preferences, he didn't pay much attention to the two women except for three or four fleeting glances.</t3667> <t3668>His demeanor reminded Elinor of a type of person and face, characterized by strong, natural, and worthless vanity, though adorned in the latest fashion.</t3668>
<t3669>Marianne escaped from the troubling thoughts caused by contempt and dissatisfaction due to the rude scrutiny, and his arrogant attitude when deciding on the various peculiar characteristics of the different toothpick boxes presented to him.</t3669> <t3670>She remained focused in her thoughts, paying no attention to what was happening, whether at Grey's shop or at home.</t3670>
<t3671>Finally, the young man's work was decided and completed.</t3671> <t3672>The items made of ivory, gold, and pearls were scheduled for pick-up.</t3672> <t3673>He determined the last day he could live without a toothpick holder, carefully and leisurely put on his gloves, glanced at the two Daswood sisters once more as if out of obligation rather than admiration, then walked out with a cheerful demeanor of pride and indifference.</t3673>
<t3674>Elinor did not want to waste time, but before she could start with the store, another man approached her.</t3674> <t3675>She turned to look and was surprised to recognize that it was her half-brother.</t3675>
<t3676>The two people expressed their affection and joy in a very commendable manner in Mr. Gray's shop. John Daswood was not at all indifferent when he met his two sisters again; all three were happy, and his inquiries about their mother were respectful and caring.</t3676>
<t3677>Elinor learned that he and Fanny had arrived in the city two days earlier.</t3677>
<t3678>He said:</t3678>
<t3679>- I really wanted to visit you two yesterday but couldn't, because my wife and I had to take Harry to see the wildlife at Exeter Exchange; and the remaining time after that, we visited Mrs. Ferrars.</t3679> <t3680>Harry was very happy.</t3680> <t3681>This morning I was determined to visit you two if I could arrange to spare half an hour, but one always has many things to do when newly arrived in the city.</t3681> <t3682>I came here to witness Fanny's seal.</t3682> <t3683>But I think I can definitely visit Berkeley Street tomorrow, and be introduced to your aunt Mrs. Jennings.</t3683> <t3684>I've heard she is a woman of very good standing.</t3684> <t3685>And the Middleton family too, you must introduce me to them.</t3685> <t3686>Since they are related to my stepmother, I would be very pleased to have the opportunity to show them my respect.</t3686> <t3687>I've been told they are wonderful neighbors to you in the countryside.</t3687>
<t3688>- It is truly wonderful.</t3688> <t3689>They care about the well-being of our family, the friendliness in every detail is more than I can put into words.</t3689>
<t3690>- I'm very glad to hear that, really, truly glad.</t3690> <t3691>But it has to be like that: they are people with a background, they have family connections with you, and all the courtesy and care to help your family feel comfortable is only natural.</t3691> <t3692>And so you both are settled most comfortably in a vacation home and lack nothing! Edward has told us about the enchanting scenery: he said the house is perfectly complete like never before, and all of you really like the new stable place.</t3692> <t3693>We are very pleased to hear that, believe us.</t3693>
<t3694>Elinor felt a little embarrassed for her brother, not regretting that she didn't have to answer him, because Mrs. Jennings' servant came to inform the two ladies that the mistress was waiting for them outside the door.</t3694>
<t3695>Mr. Daswood escorted the two ladies down the stairs, was introduced to Mrs. Jennings at the door of her carriage, reiterated his hope to visit them the next day, and then took his leave.</t3695>
<t3696>You arrived as per your duty.</t3696> <t3697>You pretended to apologize on behalf of your sister-in-law for not being able to come; "but she was too busy with her mother, to the point that she really didn't feel like going anywhere."</t3697> <t3698>Nevertheless, Mrs. Jennings reassured you that she did not want to follow formalities because they were all family, or almost so, and she would certainly visit Mrs. John Daswood and bring the two sisters along.</t3698> <t3699>Your behavior towards the two sisters was completely polite though reserved; towards Mrs. Jennings, most courteous and attentive.</t3699> <t3700>A little while later Colonel Brandon arrived, and you looked at him with a curiosity that seemed to say you only needed to know that he was very wealthy, and as courteous as you.</t3700>
<t3701>After sitting with them for half an hour, he invited Elinor to take a walk with him to Conduit Street, so she could introduce him to Sir John and Lady Middleton.</t3701> <t3702>The weather was very good, and she was willing to accept the invitation.</t3702> <t3703>As soon as they stepped out of the house, his inquiries began.</t3703>
<t3704>- Who is Colonel Brandon? Is his estate quite substantial?</t3704>
<t3705>- Yes; he has a very nice estate in Dorsetshire.</t3705>
<t3706>- I'm glad.</t3706> <t3707>He seems to be a most noble person; and Elinor, I think I can congratulate you on the prospect of a most respectable establishment in life.</t3707>
<t3708>- Hey, brother! What do you mean?</t3708>
<t3709>- He likes you.</t3709> <t3710>You have observed him very carefully, and are sure of it.</t3710> <t3711>How much is his estate worth?</t3711>
<t3712>- I believe it's around two thousand and one.</t3712>
<t3713>- Two thousand and one...</t3713>
<t3714>And then, by self-influence to achieve a level of fervent generosity, he continued:</t3714>
<t3715>- Elinor, I wish with all my heart that it could be doubled, to be worthy of you.</t3715>
<t3716>Elinor replied:</t3716>
<t3717>- I trust you, but I am certain that Colonel Brandon has no intention of marrying me.</t3717>
<t3718>- You are mistaken, Elinor, you are greatly mistaken.</t3718> <t3719>You just need to make a little effort to win him over.</t3719> <t3720>Perhaps he is hesitating now; your small fortune might make him hesitate; his friends might be advising him against it.</t3720> <t3721>But a little care and persuasion, which you can easily provide, will help him make up his mind, even if it goes against his will.</t3721> <t3722>And there is no reason why you shouldn't try with him.</t3722> <t3723>I don't mean to say that any previous attachment on your part... in short, you know which attachment I am referring to, is hopeless; the obstacles are insurmountable - you are perceptive enough to see all this.</t3723> <t3724>Colonel Brandon is the one for you, and I am not lacking in tact to make him pleased with you and your family.</t3724> <t3725>This is a marriage that will please everyone.</t3725> <t3726>In short, this is the way that... (he lowered his voice to a significant whisper) will be warmly welcomed by all parties.</t3726>
<t3727>Then, calming down, he added:</t3727>
<t3728>- That is, I mean... your loved ones all genuinely care and want to see you settled; especially Fanny, because she always cares about you, believe me.</t3728> <t3729>And her mother too, Mrs. Ferrars, a very kind woman, I am sure she will be very pleased; she said so the other day.</t3729>
<t3730>Elinor did not want to condescend to give any answer.</t3730>
<t3731>He continued:</t3731>
<t3732>- Now, there's quite an important matter; it would be amusing if Fanny had a brother and a sister both settling down at the same time.</t3732> <t3733>And yet, this very thing could happen.</t3733>
<t3734>Elinor forced herself to ask the question:</t3734>
<t3735>- Is Mr. Edward Ferrars getting married?</t3735>
<t3736>- This matter is not yet specific, but there have been some movements.</t3736> <t3737>He has a wonderful mother.</t3737> <t3738>Through extreme generosity, Mrs. Ferrars will stand up and provide him with a thousand a year if the wedding takes place.</t3738> <t3739>The bride is a Miss Morton, the only daughter of General Morton, with thirty thousand pounds.</t3739> <t3740>A marriage satisfactory to both sides, and he has no doubt it will become a reality.</t3740> <t3741>A thousand pounds a year is the interest that a mother has to pay, for life; but Mrs. Ferrars has a noble spirit.</t3741> <t3742>Let me tell you another instance of her generosity:</t3742>
<t3743>"One day, right after you had just arrived in the city, she knew that you no longer had much money, she slipped two hundred pounds into Fanny's hand.</t3743> <t3744>It was truly a gesture worthy of appreciation, because while you are here, you have to spend a lot."</t3744>
<t3745>He paused to give her time to agree and sympathize, forcing her to say:</t3745>
<t3746>- The expenses of the elder siblings in the city and countryside must certainly be significant, but the income is even greater.</t3746>
<t3747>- You dare say it's not as big as many people think.</t3747> <t3748>However, you have no intention of complaining; this is certainly a comfortable level, and you hope it will get better with time.</t3748> <t3749>The termination of the enjoyment of the benefits on the Norland Common land, which is currently underway, is the most severe depletion.</t3749> <t3750>And then you invested a little in the middle of this year to buy East Kingham Farm, you surely remember, where old Mr. Gibson once resided. The land here pleases you in every way, very close to your current land, so much so that you felt obliged to try to buy it.</t3750> <t3751>Your conscience would not allow it to fall into someone else's hands.</t3751> <t3752>One has to pay for convenience, and this land is costing you a lot of money.</t3752>
<t3753>- Costs more than its true and intrinsic value.</t3753>
<t3754>- Ah, I hope it's not that bad.</t3754> <t3755>Later, I can sell it at a higher price than what I bought it for; but speaking of the money spent, I might have been very lucky; because the stocks were so low at that time that if I didn't have the necessary amount in the bank, I would have had to sell at a heavy loss.</t3755>
<t3756>Elinor could only smile.</t3756>
<t3757>- We still have unavoidable large expenses after just moving to Norland.</t3757> <t3758>As you well know, our dear father left all the remaining furnishings of Stanhill at Norland (which are of very high value) to our stepmother.</t3758> <t3759>I am not at all upset by his decision; of course, he had the right to bequeath his estate as he wished, but the consequence of this is that we had to purchase many items like bedding, porcelain, and so on to replace those that were taken.</t3759> <t3760>You can imagine, after such expenses, we are not wealthy anymore, and Mrs. Ferrars' kindness is greatly appreciated.</t3760>
<t3761>Elinor said:</t3761>
<t3762>- Surely, and with her generosity, I hope you both can still live comfortably in any condition.</t3762>
<t3763>He replied sternly:</t3763>
<t3764>- It will take one or two more years to achieve that, but there is still a lot of work to be done.</t3764> <t3765>Fanny's greenhouse has not yet been paved with a single stone, and the flower garden has nothing except for a diagram marking the fence boundary.</t3765>
<t3766>- Where will the greenhouse be built?</t3766>
<t3767>- On the mound behind the house.</t3767> <t3768>We will have to cut down the old pecan trees to clear the area.</t3768> <t3769>This will create a beautiful landscape visible from all sides within the premises, while the flower garden will gently slope down in front, and it will be incredibly vibrant.</t3769> <t3770>You have already cut down all the thorn bushes growing along the hillside.</t3770>
<t3771>Elinor kept her concerns and criticisms to herself, feeling very fortunate that Marianne was not there to share with her the plan that provoked her thoughts about their old dwelling place.</t3771>
<t3772>After having rambled on enough to make clear his own poverty, and also to eliminate the necessity of buying each of the girls a pair of earrings during his upcoming visit to Gray's store, his thoughts turned in a cheerful direction.</t3772> <t3773>He began to congratulate Elinor on having a relative like Mrs. Jennings.</t3773>
<t3774>- She seems to be a most esteemed woman.</t3774> <t3775>Her house, her way of living, all speak to a very high level of income.</t3775> <t3776>This is a relationship that not only will be very beneficial for you from now on, but could also provide essential benefits in the future.</t3776> <t3777>Her invitation for you to come to the city is certainly very advantageous for you; and indeed, it shows such good feelings towards you that when she passes away, you will not be forgotten.</t3777> <t3778>She will have many things to bequeath.</t3778>
<t3779>- Nothing at all, I guess; because she only has the inheritance from her husband, and this portion will be inherited by her children.</t3779>
<t3780>- But don't imagine that she spends all of her income.</t3780> <t3781>Few people with ordinary prudence do so; and whatever amount she accumulates, she will distribute.</t3781>
<t3782>- Don't you think she will leave it to her two daughters instead of us?</t3782>
<t3783>- Both of her daughters married into wealthy families, so he didn't see why she needed to think of them more.</t3783> <t3784>Meanwhile, in his opinion, when she paid attention to you and treated you like this, she was giving you a right to enjoy a part that no conscious woman could forget.</t3784> <t3785>Nothing is kinder than her attitude, and it is difficult to act in such a way without the illusions created by her actions.</t3785>
<t3786>- But she did not create any illusions for those most involved.</t3786> <t3787>Brother, your concern for our well-being and welfare has taken you too far.</t3787>
<t3788>It seems he has calmed down:</t3788>
<t3789>- What? Certainly, people have very little capability, very little.</t3789> <t3790>But, dear Elinor, what is wrong with Marianne? She looks very weak, pale, and quite thin.</t3790> <t3791>Is she sick</t3791><t3792>?</t3792>
<t3793>- She is not well; she has been suffering from nervous weakness for the past few weeks.</t3793>
<t3794>- I am very sorry.</t3794> <t3795>At your age, any illness completely destroys youthful beauty!</t3795> <t3796>Your youth was too short! In September, she was still beautiful, as I had never seen before; and she had an attraction to young men.</t3796> <t3797>There was something in her beauty that particularly captivated many young men.</t3797> <t3798>I remember Fanny once said that she would have an earlier and better marriage than you; but it wasn't that she didn't love you - she just said it offhandedly.</t3798>
<t3799>"However, you would be mistaken.</t3799> <t3800>He wonders if Marianne will now marry a man who earns at most five or six hundred a year, and he would be greatly mistaken if you do not fare better."</t3800>
<t3801>"Dorsetshire!</t3801> <t3802>I know very little about Dorsetshire; but, dear Elinor, I would be very happy to learn more about this region; and I think Fanny and I could accept the invitation to be among your earliest and happiest guests."</t3802>
<t3803>Elinor earnestly tried to convince him that there was no chance she would marry Colonel Brandon, but this was such a delightful wish for him that he did not want to dismiss it.</t3803> <t3804>He sincerely resolved to cultivate a friendship with this gentleman and to promote the marriage by every possible attentive means.</t3804> <t3805>He only regretted that he had done nothing for his sisters, so he was exceedingly eager for anyone else to do more.</t3805> <t3806>Colonel Brandon's proposal, or Mrs. Jennings' inheritance, were the easiest ways to make up for his neglectful attitude.</t3806>
<t3807>The two were fortunate to meet Lady Middleton at home, and also met Sir John before the visit ended.</t3807> <t3808>Sir John was ready to befriend anyone, and although Mr. Dashwood seemed not to know much about horses, he soon classified him as a very kind person, while Lady Middleton had enough judgment about his outward appearance to think it was worth having a connection with him.</t3808> <t3809>Mr. Dashwood left satisfied with both of them.</t3809>
<t3810>When walking back with the young lady, he said:</t3810>
<t3811>- You will have an interesting story to tell Fanny.</t3811> <t3812>Lady Middleton is indeed the most elegant woman!</t3812> <t3813>I'm sure Fanny will be pleased to know a woman like her.</t3813> <t3814>And Mrs. Jennings too, a woman of very polite manners, though not as elegant as her daughter.</t3814> <t3815>My sister need not be shy with her even when visiting, and to be honest, I don't see it as a serious issue; because we know Mrs. Jennings is the widow of a man who earned every penny through lowly means; and Fanny and Mrs. Ferrars both have strong prejudices, so she and her two daughters are not the type of people Fanny would want to associate with.</t3815> <t3816>But now I can tell you all the favorable things.</t3816>
<t3817>Chapter 34</t3817>
<t3818>Mrs. John Daswood had such faith in her husband's judgment that the very next day she visited both Mrs. Jennings and her daughter.</t3818> <t3819>Her trust was rewarded when she saw that even she - even the woman who had invited her two sisters to stay - was worthy of her attention.</t3819> <t3820>As for Lady Middleton, she found her to be one of the most charming women in the world!</t3820>
<t3821>C</t3821>
<t3822>Mrs. Middleton was equally pleased with Miss Daswood. Both sides were selfish and cold, and it was this very nature that made them feel close to each other; they sympathized with each other in their dull and ignorant attitudes.</t3822>
<t3823>However, the same attitude that made Miss John Daswood win the favor of Lady Middleton did not align with Mrs. Jennings' feelings, because to her, this young lady appeared nothing more than a young woman with a smug demeanor, lacking in cordiality, who treated her sisters-in-law with no affection, and had almost nothing to say to them; for in the fifteen minutes she was graced with at Berkely Street, she sat in silence for about seven and a half minutes.</t3823>
<t3824>Although she did not want to ask, Elinor was very eager to know whether Edward was in the city at that moment, but there was nothing to prompt Fanny to voluntarily mention his name in front of her.</t3824> <t3825>She had to wait until her sister-in-law informed her that the marriage between him and Miss Morton had been settled, or until her husband's expectations regarding Colonel Brandon were met.</t3825> <t3826>Her sister-in-law believed the two were still fond of each other, so no effort to separate them through words and actions whenever possible was considered excessive.</t3826>
<t3827>However, the news that she did not want to announce was spread through another channel.</t3827> <t3828>Immediately following that, Lucy came hoping for Elinor's compassion for not having met Edward, even though he had gone to the city with the Daswood couple. He did not dare to go to Barlett House 1 for fear of being discovered, and although it was not proper to speak of their mutual eagerness, they could do nothing but exchange letters.</t3828>
<t3829>Not long after, Edward informed them that he was in the city by visiting Berkeley Street twice.</t3829> <t3830>Twice his calling card was left on the table when they returned after having to leave in the morning for work.</t3830> <t3831>Elinor was pleased that he had visited, and even more pleased that she did not meet him.</t3831>
<t3832>John Daswood and his wife were particularly pleased with the Middletons to the extent that, despite not having the habit of entertaining anyone, they decided to host a meal for them.</t3832> <t3833>Not long after the two sides became acquainted, the couple invited them to dinner on Harley Street, where they rented a very luxurious house for three months.</t3833> <t3834>The two sisters and Mrs. Jennings were also invited, and John Daswood carefully ensured that Colonel Brandon was invited as well.</t3834> <t3835>He was always happy to meet the two Miss Daswoods, so he accepted the earnest courtesies with a bit of surprise, but with much joy.</t3835>
<t3836>They will meet Mrs. Ferrars, but Elinor could not know whether her sons would be present or not.</t3836> <t3837>However, the anticipation of meeting her was enough to make her interested in the gathering.</t3837> <t3838>Although now she could meet Edward's mother without the anxiety she had felt before if such an opportunity arose, although now she could be indifferent to her remarks about her, she was still as she had been before, wanting to meet Mrs. Ferrars and curious to know what kind of person she was.</t3838>
<t3839>When she learned that the Steele sisters would also be attending, her interest in the party increased significantly, but not in a more joyful way.</t3839>
<t3840>These two ladies were very much liked by Lady Middleton; she was very fond of their diligence, so although Lucy was certainly not elegant and the elder sister was not even gentle, Lady Middleton and Sir John were still willing to invite the two ladies to stay at Conduit Street for one or two weeks.</t3840> <t3841>This was particularly advantageous for the Steele sisters, as shortly after accepting the invitation from Mr. and Mrs. John Daswood, they arrived a few days before the party took place.</t3841>
<t3842>The status of the two Steele sisters in relation to Miss Dashwood - being the nieces of the person who had taken care of her brother for many years - was not deserving enough to be invited to her dinner table.</t3842> <t3843>It was only because they were guests of Lady Middleton that she had to entertain them.</t3843> <t3844>Lucy had long wanted the family to know her, to learn more about their character and her own difficulties, so she had never in her life felt as happy as when she received Miss John Dashwood's invitation.</t3844>
<t3845>Elinor's thoughts were quite different.</t3845> <t3846>She immediately realized that Edward was staying with his mother, because his mother was invited to the party hosted by his sister, he would also have to be invited; and she would see him again for the first time in the presence of Lucy!</t3846> <t3847>She did not know how she would endure it!</t3847>
<t3848>Perhaps these worries are not entirely based on reason, and certainly not based on any truth.</t3848> <t3849>However, these worries are alleviated not by her reconsideration, but through Lucy's kindness.</t3849> <t3850>She believed she would be deeply disappointed when telling Elinor that Edward certainly would not come to Harley Street the next two Tuesdays, and she also hoped to extend the pain further by making Elinor believe that his absence was due to his deep feelings for her, which he could not conceal if they were together.</t3850>
<t3851>The important Tuesday has come to introduce the two young girls to the terrifying mother-in-law.</t3851>
<t3852>While walking up the steps together, Lucy said:</t3852>
<t3853>- Dear Miss Daswood, please have pity on me.</t3853> <t3854>There is no one here but you who can sympathize with me.</t3854> <t3855>I think I can hardly stand.</t3855> <t3856>Oh heavens! In a moment, I will meet the person who will completely decide my happiness in life - the person who will be my mother-in-law.</t3856>
<t3857>Elinor could have reassured her right away by mentioning the possibility that it would be Mrs. Morton, whom they had to consider, as her mother-in-law, not her friend's mother-in-law.</t3857> <t3858>But instead of saying that, with utmost sincerity, Elinor let her friend know that she felt sorry for her.</t3858> <t3859>Lucy was extremely surprised, because although she was indeed uncomfortable, she hoped at least to be the object of Elinor's boundless jealousy.</t3859>
<t3860>Mrs. Ferrars was a petite woman, almost hunched; upright, even formal, in stature; and stern, even acerbic, in temperament.</t3860> <t3861>She had a sallow complexion, a small face that was not beautiful, naturally devoid of expression, but fortunately, her narrowed eyebrows helped to alleviate the blandness by creating an air of pride and malice.</t3861> <t3862>She was not the type of woman who spoke much; for, unlike others, she balanced her words with the few or many opinions she had.</t3862> <t3863>Among the few syllables that escaped her, none were directed at Miss Dashwood, whom she had firmly decided to dislike in every circumstance.</t3863>
<t3864>Elinor was no longer upset by this attitude.</t3864> <t3865>A few months ago, she would have been extremely hurt; but now Mrs. Ferrars no longer had the power to make her sad; and the discriminatory gesture towards the two Miss Steeles - seemingly intentional to further humiliate her - only amused her.</t3865> <t3866>She couldn't help but smile at the politeness shown by both the mother and the daughter towards the same person - for Lucy was now receiving special attention - someone who, if they knew as she did, would cause them to worry to the point of humiliation; while she herself, incapable of hurting them, was scorned by both.</t3866> <t3867>But while she smiled at the misplaced politeness, she thought about the narrow-minded arrogance that was the source of that politeness, observed the deliberate attentions of the two Miss Steeles to secure continued politeness, and despised all four of them.</t3867>
<t3868>Lucy was extremely delighted to be distinguished in such an honorable manner, while Miss Steele wanted to be teased about Doctor Davies to be completely happy.</t3868>
<t3869>The banquet was very sumptuous, the servants were countless, everything showed the Mistress's intention to show off and the Master's ability to support her.</t3869> <t3870>Despite all the upgrades and new constructions at the Norland estate, and even though the owners once nearly had to sell a thousand pounds worth of shares to cover losses, there was no sign of the poverty that he had tried to infer; there was no appearance of poverty except in the manner of conversation; but in this respect, the deficiency was significant. John Daswood had little to say about himself that was worth hearing, and his wife had even less.</t3870> <t3871>But there was nothing shameful in this, as it was also the case with most of the guests, who always tried to appear agreeable - lacking awareness - either innately or through learning - lacking elegance, weak in spirit, or weak in temperament.</t3871>
<t3872>When the women entered the family room after the meal, this weakness became even more apparent, as the men had provided a variety of topics for discussion - ranging from politics, fencing off some plots of land, to taming some horses - but then all the exchanges ran dry; and until the coffee was brought out, a topic that only the women participated in was comparing the height of Harry Daswood and Lady Middleton's second son, both of whom were nearly the same age.</t3872>
<t3873>If there were two children there, the problem could be easily identified by immediately measuring their heights.</t3873> <t3874>But since only Harry was present, both sides could only speculate, and each had equal authority to assert their opinions, repeating them whenever they liked.</t3874>
<t3875>So the meeting proceeded as follows:</t3875>
<t3876>The two polite mothers acknowledged that the other side was taller, even though each believed that her own child was taller.</t3876>
<t3877>Both grandmothers passionately defended their grandchildren, with a bias that was no less but more sincere.</t3877>
<t3878>Worried about making one side happier than the other, Lucy thought both children were tall for their age and couldn't recognize any slight differences between them.</t3878> <t3879>Through her solemn way of speaking, Miss Steele quickly said that each child was taller than the other.</t3879>
<t3880>Elinor once expressed an opinion in favor of William, which offended Mrs. Ferrars and Fanny further, and saw no need to elaborate.</t3880> <t3881>When asked about Marianne, she offended everyone by responding that she had no opinion because she had never thought about these details.</t3881>
<t3882>Before leaving Norland, Elinor had painted a pair of very beautiful screens for her sister-in-law, which were now brought home to adorn the family room.</t3882> <t3883>John Dashwood saw the two screens as he followed the gentlemen inside, and he eagerly pointed them out to Colonel Brandon for appreciation.</t3883> <t3884>He said:</t3884>
<t3885>- This was drawn by my elder sister, and I believe you, being a person with a taste for art, will appreciate it.</t3885> <t3886>I'm not sure if you have ever seen her draw, but she is recognized as quite a good artist.</t3886>
<t3887>Although he denied having a taste for appreciation, the Colonel praised warmly, just as he could praise anything that Miss Daswood painted.</t3887> <t3888>When others became curious, they passed around the two screens to admire them.</t3888> <t3889>Not knowing this was Elinor's work, Mrs. Ferrars asked to see it; and after Lady Middleton expressed her admiration, Fanny presented it to her mother, while tactfully informing her that it was painted by Miss Daswood.</t3889>
<t3890>Mrs. Ferrars only said "Hmm, very nice," without looking through them, and handed the two curtains back to her daughter.</t3890>
<t3891>Perhaps at this moment Fanny thought her mother was somewhat rude, because blushing a little, she immediately said:</t3891>
<t3892>- Mom, these two pictures are very beautiful; do you see them?</t3892>
<t3893>And then, perhaps fear had been too polite, showing too much support for her brother-in-law, she added:</t3893>
<t3894>- Mom, do you think these two screens have a hint of Miss Morton's painting style?</t3894> <t3895>She really paints very attractively!</t3895> <t3896>How beautiful her recent landscape painting looks!</t3896>
<t3897>- It is truly beautiful! But she excels at everything she does.</t3897>
<t3898>Marianne could not bear it.</t3898> <t3899>She was very displeased with Mrs. Ferrars; and the praise of another person at such an inappropriate time, aimed at humiliating Elinor, even though she did not fully understand the implication, provoked her to angrily say immediately:</t3899>
<t3900>- This is a very special kind of enjoyment! What is Miss Morton to us?</t3900> <t3901>Who knows, or who cares about her?</t3901> <t3902>We are thinking and talking about Elinor.</t3902>
<t3903>And while saying that, she snatched the two curtains from her sister-in-law's hands, so that she herself could enjoy them in the proper way.</t3903>
<t3904>Mrs. Ferrars looked extremely angry, straightened up, and retorted sharply:</t3904>
<t3905>- Miss Morton is the daughter of General Morton.</t3905>
<t3906>Fanny also appeared very angry, and her husband was completely horrified by his sister's audacity.</t3906> <t3907>Elinor was more annoyed by Marianne's liveliness than by the reactions of others; but Colonel Brandon's eyes, fixed on Marianne, showed that he saw in her liveliness only charm, a loving heart that could not bear to see her sister slighted in even the smallest matter.</t3907>
<t3908>Marianne's thoughts did not stop there.</t3908> <t3909>She thought the coldly offensive attitude of Mrs. Ferrars towards her sister seemed to forewarn Elinor of the difficulties and sufferings that her own wounded heart had taught her to think of with horror; and driven by a powerful impulse of affectionate feeling, she went to her sister's chair, wrapped her arms around her sister's neck, pressed one cheek against her sister's cheek, and lowered her voice tenderly:</t3909>
<t3910>- Sister, dear Elinor, don't pay attention to them.</t3910> <t3911>Don't let them make you suffer.</t3911>
<t3912>She could not say anything more; her spirit was exhausted; burying her face on Elinor's shoulder, she sobbed uncontrollably.</t3912> <t3913>Everyone was called to attention, and almost everyone was concerned.</t3913> <t3914>Colonel Brandon stood up and walked over to them without knowing what he was doing.</t3914> <t3915>Mrs. Jennings, with the very clever remark "Oh!</t3915> <t3916>Poor thing," immediately offered her some smelling salts.</t3916> <t3917>Sir John was hopelessly angry at the author of this mental anguish, so much so that he sat near Lucy Steele and, in a whisper, recounted the entire shocking incident.</t3917>
<t3918>However, within a few minutes, Marianne had recovered enough to put an end to all the commotion, and, along with the others, sat down; although her spirit still bore the impression of what had happened throughout the evening.</t3918>
<t3919>Her brother softly said to Colonel Brandon:</t3919>
<t3920>- Poor Marianne! She does not have as good health as her sister, her spirit is uneasy, she does not have the physical strength of Elinor; and we should sympathize that there is something very troubling for a woman who was once a beauty queen losing her charm.</t3920> <t3921>You may not know, but a few months ago Marianne was quite beautiful - almost as beautiful as Elinor.</t3921> <t3922>Now you see all her beauty has vanished.</t3922>
<t3923>Chapter 35</t3923>
<t3924>All of Elinor's curiosity about Mrs. Ferrars had been satisfied.</t3924> <t3925>She had found in her everything that would make the strengthening of ties between the two families only cause more trouble.</t3925> <t3926>She had seen enough of her pride, her narrow-mindedness, and her determined prejudice against herself to understand all the difficulties that would entangle their relationship and delay the marriage between Edward and herself - even if he were free.</t3926> <t3927>She also recognized enough to feel fortunate for herself, fortunate that a greater obstacle had shielded her from suffering any further drama from Mrs. Ferrars, shielding her from dependence on her whims or from the concern of seeking her favorable opinion.</t3927> <t3928>Or at least, if she could not force herself to appear happy seeing Edward shackled to Lucy, she thought if Lucy were amiable, she ought to feel happy.</t3928>
<t3929>M</t3929>
<t3930>She found it strange that Lucy's spirits were so uplifted by Mrs. Ferrars' polite gesture; and also strange that profit and vanity had blinded her so much that she saw the attention—seemingly given to her just because she was not Elinor—as a compliment or encouragement, merely because her situation was kept secret.</t3930> <t3931>But this spirit was not only expressed through Lucy's eyes at that moment, but also openly conveyed the next morning, when she asked Lady Middleton for permission to go to Berkeley Street in the hope of meeting Elinor to tell her how delighted she was.</t3931>
<t3932>Lucy was fortunate, because shortly after she arrived, a message from Mrs. Palmer was sent that made Mrs. Jennings leave.</t3932>
<t3933>As soon as the two were alone together, Lucy exclaimed:</t3933>
<t3934>- Dear friend, I have come to share with you my happiness.</t3934> <t3935>Is there anything that could make me more content than the way Mrs. Ferrars treated me last night?</t3935> <t3936>She was so gracious! You know, I was terrified at the thought of meeting her; but as soon as I was introduced, her courteous demeanor seemed to say she already liked me very much.</t3936> <t3937>Isn't that so?</t3937> <t3938>You saw everything, and did you get the same impression?</t3938>
<t3939>- She must be polite to you.</t3939>
<t3940>- Politeness! You see nothing but politeness?</t3940> <t3941>I see many other things - kindness shown only to me! No pride, no arrogance; and your sister as well - both sweet and gentle.</t3941>
<t3942>Elinor wanted to talk about something else, but Lucy kept insisting that she had reason to feel happy for her friend; and Elinor was forced to continue:</t3942>
<t3943>- Surely, if they had known about her engagement, they would not have been satisfied with such treatment; but that is not the case -</t3943>
<t3944>Lucy quickly replied:</t3944>
<t3945>- I guessed you would say that, but there is no reason for Mrs. Ferrars to pretend to like me, and that is all that matters to me.</t3945> <t3946>You should not lead me to be dissatisfied.</t3946> <t3947>I am sure everything will end well, and there will be no obstacle regarding what I have always thought about.</t3947> <t3948>Mrs. Ferrars is a charming woman, and so is your sister-in-law.</t3948> <t3949>Both are truly captivating women! I wonder why I have never heard you say how pleasant Mrs. John Dashwood is!</t3949>
<t3950>Elinor did not answer, and did not attempt to answer.</t3950>
<t3951>- Miss Daswood, are you okay?</t3951> <t3952>You look weak; you must not be feeling well.</t3952>
<t3953>- I have never felt this healthy.</t3953>
<t3954>- I am happy with all my heart, but it seems she doesn't see it that way.</t3954> <t3955>I would be very sad if I made her unwell; she has been the greatest comfort in my life!</t3955> <t3956>Only heaven knows what I would do without her friendship.</t3956>
<t3957>Elinor forced herself to respond politely, though she doubted the politeness of her own demeanor.</t3957> <t3958>But Lucy seemed satisfied, as she immediately replied:</t3958>
<t3959>- Actually, I completely trust in the affection you have for me; and apart from Edward's love, this is the greatest encouragement for me.</t3959> <t3960>Poor Edward!</t3960> <t3961>But now there's good news - we will be allowed to meet, and meet often.</t3961> <t3962>Since Lady Middleton is pleased with Mrs. John Daswood, I am sure we will visit Harley Street frequently, and Edward will spend half his time with his sister.</t3962> <t3963>Moreover, Lady Middleton and Mrs. Ferrars will visit; and since both Mrs. Ferrars and your sister-in-law have more than once said they like me, they will always be happy whenever they see me again.</t3963> <t3964>They are such charming women! I am sure if you have the chance to tell your sister-in-law what I think of her, no matter how much you say, it won't be an exaggeration.</t3964>
<t3965>But Elinor would not make any encouraging move to give her hope that she would speak to her sister-in-law.</t3965>
<t3966>Lucy continued:</t3966>
<t3967>- I am certain that if Mrs. Ferrars had any ill will towards me, I would notice it immediately.</t3967> <t3968>For example, she would only need to make a stern gesture without saying a word, never paying attention to me, never looking at me in a pleasant way - you know what I mean, - if I were treated in such a forbidding manner, I would give up all hope in despair.</t3968> <t3969>I would not be able to endure it.</t3969> <t3970>Because once she truly harbors ill will, I know this ill will would be the most intense.</t3970>
<t3971>Elinor was prevented from responding to the triumph because the door opened, the servant announced that Mr. Edward had arrived, and shortly after, Edward walked in.</t3971>
<t3972>This is a truly awkward moment, and everyone's expressions clearly show it.</t3972> <t3973>All three appeared extremely foolish; and Edward seemed like he wanted to turn back while also wanting to step in further.</t3973> <t3974>In the most uncomfortable atmosphere, all three fell into the very situation that each desperately wanted to avoid.</t3974> <t3975>Not only did the three meet again, but they met in a circumstance where neither of the other two offered any support.</t3975> <t3976>The two women calmed down first.</t3976> <t3977>Lucy couldn't step forward because she had to maintain the appearance of secrecy.</t3977> <t3978>So she could only look at the one she loved, and after a slight greeting, said nothing more.</t3978>
<t3979>But Elinor had more to do.</t3979> <t3980>She wanted to behave appropriately for both his and her sake, so after a moment of composure, she welcomed him with the most relaxed and open demeanor.</t3980> <t3981>She would not allow Lucy's presence, or the awareness of some injustices towards her, to prevent her from saying that she was pleased to see him again, and that she regretted being absent when he visited last time.</t3981> <t3982>While saying these things, which were the usual things to say as a friend and almost a family relation, she was not afraid of Lucy's keen eyes closely observing her.</t3982>
<t3983>Her gesture somewhat reassured Edward, and he had enough courage to sit down.</t3983> <t3984>But he was still more awkward than the two women, because his heart was not as indifferent as Lucy's and his mind was not as at ease as Elinor's.</t3984>
<t3985>Through a discreet and stable demeanor, Lucy seemed intent on not helping the other two feel comfortable, so she did not say a word.</t3985> <t3986>Almost every word spoken came from Elinor, as she was compelled to provide information about her mother's health, the sisters' trip to the city, and so on—matters that Edward should have inquired about, but he did not ask a single question.</t3986>
<t3987>Her efforts did not stop there, because after that she made the heroic decision to let the two people have privacy with each other, using the excuse of going to find Marianne.</t3987> <t3988>She genuinely did so, and this was in the most courteous manner, as she lingered at the top of the stairs for a few minutes, in noble perseverance, before going to Marianne.</t3988>
<t3989>But after that, Edward's blissful situation had to come to an end, because Marianne came running in excitedly.</t3989> <t3990>Her joy, like all her emotions, was intense in her mind, and even more intense in her words.</t3990> <t3991>She greeted him with a hand he had to take, and a voice he had to recognize as the affection of a sister-in-law.</t3991> <t3992>She exclaimed:</t3992>
<t3993>- Dear Edward, what a moment of happiness!</t3993> <t3994>This almost makes up for everything!</t3994>
<t3995>Edward tried to respond in a worthy manner, but in front of witnesses like that, he did not dare to say even half of what he felt.</t3995> <t3996>Then everyone sat down again, and for one or two moments, all were silent; while Marianne, with the most affectionate look, sometimes glanced at Edward and sometimes at Elinor, regretting that the joy of the two was restrained by the uninvited presence of Lucy.</t3996> <t3997>Edward was the first to speak, commenting on Marianne's changed appearance, expressing concern that London's weather did not suit her.</t3997>
<t3998>Although lively in spirit, with tears glistening in her eyes, Marianne replied:</t3998>
<t3999>- Oh, don't think about me, don't think about my health.</t3999> <t4000>Elinor is still well, you see.</t4000> <t4001>That is enough for the two of us.</t4001>
<t4002>The remark was not calculated to make either Edward or Lucy more comfortable, nor was it intended to win Lucy's favor.</t4002> <t4003>She looked up at Marianne with a not very gentle expression.</t4003>
<t4004>Trying to say something to steer the conversation in a different direction, Edward said:</t4004>
<t4005>- Do you like London?</t4005>
<t4006>- I don't like it at all.</t4006> <t4007>I was expecting a lot of fun, but I didn't find anything.</t4007> <t4008>Edward, meeting you again is the only consolation that London has brought, and thank heavens!</t4008> <t4009>You are still the same as before!</t4009>
<t4010>Marianne paused - no one spoke.</t4010> <t4011>She continued:</t4011>
<t4012>- Sister Elinor, I think we should ask Edward to take care of us on our return trip to Barton.</t4012> <t4013>I guess we will go in two or three weeks, and I hope Edward will be willing to take on the responsibility.</t4013>
<t4014>Edward whispered something, but no one knew what it was, not even himself.</t4014> <t4015>Marianne recognized that he was emotional, and could easily speculate any reason she liked best, so she was completely satisfied, then moved on to another topic:</t4015>
<t4016>- Edward, yesterday was indeed an evening my sister and I spent at Harley Street! It was so boring, incredibly boring!</t4016> <t4017>I want to tell you a lot about this thrilling matter, but I can't speak now.</t4017>
<t4018>And through this commendable discretion to wait until they were in private, she had delayed informing him that their relatives had become more unpleasant than ever, and she was particularly disgusted with his mother.</t4018>
<t4019>- But why weren't you there, Edward?</t4019> <t4020>Why didn't you come?</t4020>
<t4021>- I am busy elsewhere.</t4021>
<t4022>- Busy! But what is it, when there are friends like these and not meeting them?</t4022>
<t4023>Eager to retaliate, Lucy exclaimed:</t4023>
<t4024>- Miss Marianne, perhaps you think young men never break an appointment if they don't intend to keep their promises, both small and large.</t4024>
<t4025>Elinor was extremely angry, but Marianne seemed completely indifferent to the jab, as she calmly replied:</t4025>
<t4026>- It's not like that; because, seriously speaking, I know well that only his conscience keeps Edward away from Harley Street.</t4026> <t4027>And I truly believe that he has the most delicate conscience in the world: the most meticulous awareness when conducting every appointment, no matter how trivial, dull, or boring it may be to him.</t4027> <t4028>Compared to the people I have met, he is the most afraid of causing painful expectations or harm, and his capacity for selfishness is the least.</t4028> <t4029>Edward, indeed, and I will say so.</t4029> <t4030>What! You have never heard yourself being praised!</t4030> <t4031>Then you are not my brother, because those who accept my affection and respect must endure my public praise.</t4031>
<t4032>However, in the present case, her manner of praise was particularly out of tune with the sentiments of two-thirds of her audience and not very amusing to Edward, to the extent that he soon stood up to take his leave.</t4032>
<t4033>Marianne said:</t4033>
<t4034>- Rushing too much! My dear Edward, you shouldn't do that.</t4034>
<t4035>Then pulling him aside, she whispered to persuade him that Lucy couldn't sit any longer.</t4035> <t4036>But even this encouraging act failed, as he had to leave.</t4036> <t4037>As for Lucy, who could have sat longer even if he stayed for two more hours, she also left shortly after.</t4037>
<t4038>After the two people had left, Marianne said:</t4038>
<t4039>- What has made her come here so often like this? Doesn't she realize we want her to leave!</t4039> <t4040>Always mocking Edward</t4040><t4041>!</t4041>
<t4042>- Why? We are all his friends, and Lucy is the oldest friend among us.</t4042> <t4043>Of course he wants to see her just as much as he wants to see us.</t4043>
<t4044>Marianne looked intently at her and said:</t4044>
<t4045>- Elinor, you know, this is the kind of talk I cannot stand.</t4045> <t4046>If you only hope for someone to refute your assertion, as I guess is the case here, you should remember that I am the last person in the world to do this.</t4046> <t4047>I cannot lower myself to be deceived into believing in reassurances that no one needs.</t4047>
<t4048>She walked out of the room.</t4048> <t4049>Elinor did not dare to follow her sister to say more.</t4049> <t4050>Having promised Lucy to keep the matter confidential, she could not provide information to persuade Marianne; and though she might be pained by the consequences of continuing to conceal it, she was forced to endure it.</t4050> <t4051>All she could hope for was that Edward would not frequently place her or him in the painful situation caused by Marianne's mistaken fervor, or repeat any similar pain like the recent encounter - and she had every reason to fear.</t4051>
<t4052>Chapter 36</t4052>
<t4053>The day after they met, the press informed the public that Lady Thomas Palmer had safely given birth to a baby boy, who was also the future heir; a very noteworthy and satisfying piece of news, at least for the close relations who had been previously informed.</t4053>
<t4054>I</t4054>
<t4055>This event was extremely important for Mrs. Jennings' happiness, causing a change in her daily schedule and, to some extent, affecting the social interactions of her two young nieces.</t4055> <t4056>Because she wanted to spend as much time as possible with Charlotte, she would leave early in the morning and not return until late in the evening each day.</t4056> <t4057>At the special request of the Middleton family, the two Dashwood sisters went to stay at Conduit Street during the day.</t4057> <t4058>For comfort, the two sisters wanted to stay at Mrs. Jennings' house at least for the entire morning; however, they could not resist everyone's wishes.</t4058> <t4059>Therefore, the home of the two sisters was moved to Lady Middleton and the two Steele sisters, who actually did not much like the presence of the two sisters despite having extended the invitation.</t4059>
<t4060>The two sisters had much discernment and therefore did not like to associate with the Lady, while they were viewed with envy by the Steele sisters for having intruded upon their territory and shared the kindness they wanted to monopolize.</t4060> <t4061>Although there was nothing more polite than Lady Middleton's attitude towards Elinor and Marianne, in reality, she did not like the two sisters at all.</t4061> <t4062>Because the two sisters did not flatter her or indulge her children, she could not believe they were kind-hearted; because they liked to read, she imagined they had a sarcastic nature: perhaps not knowing exactly what sarcasm was, but this did not matter.</t4062> <t4063>This was a common term used to criticize and was easily dispensed.</t4063>
<t4064>The presence of the two Dashwood sisters created a constraint on Mrs. Middleton's laziness and on Lucy's actions.</t4064> <t4065>Lady Middleton felt ashamed when she did nothing in front of them, while at other times, Lucy feared the sisters would despise the sycophantic behavior she proudly devised and displayed.</t4065> <t4066>Among the three, Miss Steele was the least troubled by the presence of the sisters; and the sisters had the ability to completely reconcile her to this cohabitation.</t4066> <t4067>If either of the sisters spent even a minute recounting the romance between Marianne and Willoughby, Miss Steele might think she had been fully rewarded for sacrificing the best seat by the fire after dinner.</t4067>
<t4068>But this reconciliation was not proclaimed: although Miss Steele occasionally let slip to Elinor her pity for her sister, and more than once expressed in front of Marianne her thoughts on the inconstancy of young men, she elicited no reaction, except for indifference from Elinor or contempt from Marianne.</t4068> <t4069>If only they would tease her about the Doctor! But unlike others, the two sisters did not want to indulge her, so much so that if Sir John dined out, she might not hear anyone else tease her on this subject all day, other than herself kindly mocking her own situation.</t4069>
<t4070>However, Mrs. Jennings was completely unaware of these jealousies and discontents, to the point that she thought it was delightful for young girls to live together; and every evening she congratulated the two young ladies for having escaped the control of a foolish old woman for such a long time! She sometimes gathered with the two girls at Sir John's house, sometimes at her own house.</t4070> <t4071>But wherever it was, she always displayed a spirited, cheerful, and significant demeanor, claiming that Charlotte's good health was thanks to her, ready to seize the opportunity - since only Miss Steele was curious enough to ask her to speak - to recount every precise detail about her daughter's condition.</t4071>
<t4072>One thing that truly made her upset, and she complained about it every day.</t4072> <t4073>Mr. Palmer still held the common view among men - but did not seem fatherly at all - that all babies looked the same.</t4073> <t4074>Although at different stages she could clearly recognize the distinct resemblances between this baby and every baby from both sides of the family, she could not convince the baby's father to believe so; and she had no way to make him acknowledge the simple fact that this baby was the cutest in the world.</t4074>
<t4075>A misfortune befell Mrs. John Dashwood during this time.</t4075> <t4076>That is, while her two sisters-in-law, along with Mrs. Jennings, were visiting her on Harley Street, another acquaintance of hers stopped by - a situation that in itself did not necessarily have to bring disaster upon her.</t4076> <t4077>But while people's imagination can lead them far astray to make erroneous judgments about a person's character and conclude about this character only through appearances, somehow our happiness must always be subject to chance.</t4077> <t4078>In this matter, that woman also let her imagination go too far from the truth and the possible, to the extent that upon merely hearing the names of the two Miss Dashwoods and knowing they were Mr. Dashwood's sisters, she immediately concluded that they were residing on Harley Street.</t4078>
<t4079>This confusion was manifested one or two days later, on an invitation card sent to the two sisters and their brother-in-law, for a concert at the lady's house.</t4079> <t4080>As a result, Miss John Daswood was compelled to send the carriage to pick up the two sisters, but worse, she was annoyed at having to show care for the two sisters, and who could say that the two sisters would not go along a second time?</t4080> <t4081>Indeed, she always had the ability to disappoint people.</t4081> <t4082>But that was not enough; for when people have determined a certain kind of character they believe to be wrong, they feel hurt when expecting anything better in front of them.</t4082>
<t4083>At this time, Marianne had developed the habit of going out every day, so she became indifferent to the matter of whether to go or not.</t4083> <t4084>She prepared calmly and mechanically for the evening's social interactions, without expecting any small pleasures, and very often, until the last minute, she did not care to know where she would be going.</t4084>
<t4085>Judging by her attire and appearance, Marianne seemed completely indifferent, as if she paid no attention to half the details while preparing with Miss Steele's makeup in five minutes.</t4085> <t4086>Nothing escaped Miss Steele's meticulous and curious observation: she looked at everything, asked about everything; never at ease until she knew the price of each item in Marianne's outfit.</t4086> <t4087>She could even guess the number of ball gowns her friend had with better judgment than Marianne herself, and she couldn't help but hope to know before leaving how much her friend's weekly laundry cost and her annual expenses.</t4087> <t4088>Moreover, such impertinent scrutinies often ended with a compliment, intended to be soothing but which Marianne found most insolent; for after undergoing an examination of the price and brand of her ball gown, the color of her shoes, and the style of her hair, she was almost certain to hear something like "she really does look very pretty, and surely she will win over many people."</t4088>
<t4089>With such praise, she was freed from her current situation and ready to step into her brother's carriage five minutes after it stopped at the door; the timing did not please her sister-in-law much as she had already gone ahead to their friend's house, hoping for minimal delays that could inconvenience herself or the coachman.</t4089>
<t4090>The evening was nothing particularly special.</t4090> <t4091>It was like other gatherings with music for entertainment, many people had a soul for appreciating the performance, and many more did not pay attention to the music; and as usual, according to their assessment and that of their close friends, the musicians were the first freelance artists in England.</t4091>
<t4092>Since Elinor was not inclined towards music and did not pretend to understand it, she did not feel shy about turning her back to the piano whenever she wanted, and she was even more comfortable in the presence of a harp and a grand violin.</t4092> <t4093>During one of her glances around, she recognized among a group of young men, the very person who had given her and her sister a lecture about the toothpick case at Gray's shop.</t4093> <t4094>Soon she realized he was looking directly at her, speaking intimately with her brother.</t4094> <t4095>Just as she was about to inquire about his name from her brother, the two approached her, and Mr. Dashwood introduced Mr. Robert Ferrars to her.</t4095>
<t4096>He greeted her with a relaxed politeness, tilting his head in a way that made it clear, as if in words, that he was exactly the type of dandy that Lucy had described to her.</t4096> <t4097>She might have been amused, if her feelings for Edward depended less on his own qualities and more on those of his closest relatives! For at this moment, the way his younger brother tilted his head in greeting must have added the final touch to the dismal picture painted by his mother and sister.</t4097> <t4098>But while she was pondering the differences between the two young men, she did not realize that the emptiness in the deceit of one had made her more tolerant of the humility and true worth of the other.</t4098>
<t4099>Why they are different, Robert himself explained in a fifteen-minute conversation.</t4099> <t4100>Because, while talking about his brother and lamenting his brother's clumsiness which he believed prevented his brother from fitting into suitable social circles, he was candid and generous in attributing less blame to any innate defect and more to the unfortunate fate of private education.</t4100>
<t4101>He also added that he himself, although he may not have any naturally superior qualities, only thanks to the advantages of public school, appeared well-suited to blend in with society as well as any other man.</t4101> <t4102>He continued:</t4102>
<t4103>- To be honest, I believe it is not due to any other matter, and I often tell my mother when she laments about this issue, 'Mom, you have to relax.</t4103> <t4104>The situation now is dire, and it is entirely caused by you.</t4104> <t4105>Why did you let your brother, Sir Robert, persuade you against your judgment to send Edward to a private school during the most critical period of his life?</t4105> <t4106>If you had just sent him to Westminster like I did instead of sending him to Mr. Pratt's school, all of this would have been prevented.'</t4106> <t4107>I always see the crux of the problem here, and my mother fully accepts her fault.</t4107>
<t4108>Elinor could not refute his opinion, because no matter how she judged the advantages of a public school, she could not be at all satisfied with the thought of the time he spent with Mr. Pratt's family.</t4108>
<t4109>He commented:</t4109>
<t4110>- I think she is staying in Devonshire, in a holiday cottage near Dawlish.</t4110>
<t4111>Elinor corrected him about the location, and he seemed quite surprised to learn that one could live in Devonshire without being near Dawlish.</t4111> <t4112>However, he bestowed warm approval on the characteristics of the type of house she was residing in.</t4112>
<t4113>He said:</t4113>
<t4114>- As for me, I am very fond of vacation homes; there is always something very comfortable, very elegant about this type of house.</t4114> <t4115>And I dare say, if I had extra money, I would buy a small piece of land and build a vacation home for myself, a short distance from London so that I could drive there anytime, gather a few friends, and enjoy together. I advise everyone who is about to build a house to build it in the style of a vacation home.</t4115>
<t4116>"One day, my friend General Courtland came to me for advice and showed me three different house plans by Bonomi 1, asking me to choose the best house model.</t4116> <t4117>Immediately, I threw all three plans into the fireplace and said, 'Dear Mr. Courtland, don't choose any of them, but by all means, build a vacation house.'</t4117> <t4118>And I thought, that was the decision that settled everything.'</t4118><t4119>"</t4119>
<t4120>He continued:</t4120>
<t4121>- Some people imagine that there isn't enough comfort, not enough space in a vacation house; but they are mistaken.</t4121> <t4122>Last month I visited my friend Elliott's house, near Dartford.</t4122> <t4123>Mrs. Elliott wanted to organize a ball.</t4123> <t4124>She said, 'But what should we do?</t4124> <t4125>Dear Ferrars, please tell me how to arrange it.</t4125> <t4126>There isn't any room in this vacation house comfortably big enough for ten people, and where to place the dining table?"</t4126>
<t4127>"I immediately saw that it was not difficult at all, so I said: 'Dear Lady Elliott, don't worry.</t4127> <t4128>The dining hall corridor can easily accommodate eighteen couples; we can place card tables in the family room; open the reading room to serve tea and other refreshments; and the dining table in the public room 2.'</t4128> <t4129>Lady Elliott was pleased with my idea.</t4129> <t4130>We measured the family room and found it could accommodate exactly eighteen couples, so everything was arranged according to my plan."</t4130>
<t4131>"See, don't you think, if one just knows how to arrange things, they can still have all the comforts as if they were in the largest house."</t4131>
<t4132>Elinor agreed with everything, because she thought he did not deserve the honor of being reasonably argued with.</t4132>
<t4133>Since John Daswood did not like music more than his sister, his mind was free to focus on any other matters; and a thought suddenly came to him in the evening so that when the two returned home, he discussed it with his wife, hoping she would agree.</t4133> <t4134>When thinking about Mrs. Dennison's misunderstanding, believing that his two sisters were staying at his house, he felt it would be more proper to sincerely invite the two sisters to stay with them, during the time Mrs. Jennings was busy, causing the two to have to go to someone else's house.</t4134> <t4135>The cost would be nothing, and the inconvenience would not be much more; and after all, his conscience pointed out that he needed to fulfill his promise to his father to take care of his sisters.</t4135>
<t4136>Fanny was utterly surprised by his proposal.</t4136> <t4137>She said:</t4137>
<t4138>- I don't know how to avoid confronting Lady Middleton, because the two of them are coming to her every day; otherwise, I would be very happy to receive them.</t4138> <t4139>You know, I am always ready to pay attention to them within my capacity, as taking them along tonight has shown.</t4139> <t4140>But they are guests of Lady Middleton.</t4140> <t4141>How can I ask them to break away from her?</t4141>
<t4142>But through his poor thinking, the husband did not realize she was expressing opposition:</t4142>
<t4143>- The two ladies had been visiting Conduit Street in this manner for the past week, and Lady Middleton would not mind giving them an equal number of days to visit their close relatives like this.</t4143>
<t4144>Fanny hesitated for a moment, then became lively again:</t4144>
<t4145>- I want to invite them with all my heart, if it's within my ability.</t4145> <t4146>But I have just arranged everything on my part to invite the two Miss Steeles to stay with us for a few days.</t4146> <t4147>Both of them have good manners; and I think we need to take good care of them, because their uncle has taken good care of Edward.</t4147> <t4148>You know, we can invite your sisters next year; but the two Miss Steeles might not be living in the city anymore.</t4148> <t4149>I'm sure you'll like the two of them; you already genuinely like them, you see, my mother does too, and they are very friendly with Harry!</t4149>
<t4150>Mr. Daswood was convinced.</t4150> <t4151>He immediately felt it necessary to invite the two Miss Steeles, and his conscience was appeased by the intention of inviting his sisters next year, around the same time; but at the same time, he had the cunning thought that after a year, it would no longer be necessary to invite them, as Elinor would be the Colonel's wife, and Marianne would be their guest.</t4151>
<t4152>Happy to have escaped danger and proud of having quickly found a way out, the next morning Fanny wrote a letter inviting the two sisters, Lucy, to stay at Harley Street for a few days once Lady Middleton agreed.</t4152>
<t4153>That was enough for Lucy to feel genuinely and rightfully happy.</t4153> <t4154>Mrs. John Daswood seemed to act on her own accord for her, sympathizing with all her desires, and encouraging her views! More than anything, the opportunity to be close to Edward and his family suited her interests perfectly, and such an invitation made her heart most content!</t4154> <t4155>This was an advantage that she could never be grateful enough for, and could never take advantage of quickly enough.</t4155> <t4156>The visit to Lady Middleton, which previously had no definite end, now suddenly seemed intended to conclude within the next two days.</t4156>
<t4157>Within ten minutes of Lucy receiving the invitation, Elinor was shown the contents.</t4157> <t4158>For the first time, she shared Lucy's aspirations; for such an unusually kind gesture, bestowed upon someone known for such a short time, seemed to indicate that the goodwill towards her friend stemmed from something better than malice, and with time and expressions of affection, could bring about anything that Lucy desired.</t4158> <t4159>Lucy’s fawning manner had subdued Lady Middleton’s pride and infiltrated the guarded heart of Mrs. John Dashwood, and these were the results leading to greater achievements.</t4159>
<t4160>The two Steele sisters moved to Harley Street, and all the news about their influence further reinforced Elinor's thoughts.</t4160> <t4161>More than once Sir John visited the two sisters and reported back that they were particularly well-liked.</t4161> <t4162>Mrs. John Dashwood had never enjoyed the company of young ladies as much as she did with these two, gifting each of them a book on embroidery written by some immigrant, addressing Lucy by her first name instead of her surname, and not knowing when she could part from the two sisters.</t4162>
<t4163>Chapter 37</t4163>
<t4164>Miss Palmer became quite strong after two weeks, to the extent that her mother thought she no longer needed to spend all her time with her daughter.</t4164> <t4165>Satisfied with one or two visits each day, she returned to her activities at her own home, and found that the two Miss Dashwoods were ready to continue living with her.</t4165>
<t4166>C</t4166>
<t4167>After three or four days of settling down like that in Berkeley Street, Mrs. Jennings returned home from her regular visit to Miss Palmer, entering the family room to find Elinor, with an air of hurried importance as if preparing her to hear some wonderful news.</t4167> <t4168>Giving her just enough time to guess this intention, she immediately demonstrated its significance:</t4168>
<t4169>- Oh my God, dear Miss Daswood!</t4169> <t4170>Have you heard the news?</t4170>
<t4171>- Ma'am, not yet.</t4171> <t4172>What news?</t4172>
<t4173>- There's something very strange going on!</t4173> <t4174>But you need to hear everything.</t4174> <t4175>When I arrived at Mr. Palmer's house, I found Charlotte in a panic because of the baby.</t4175> <t4176>The little one believed that the child was very ill - it was crying, restless, and covered in red spots.</t4176> <t4177>So I examined it, and then I said, 'My God! Darling, there's nothing wrong, this is just teething rash,' and the nurse said the same.</t4177> <t4178>But Charlotte, the little one, didn't believe it, so Mr. Donavan was called, and luckily he happened to be passing by Harley Street, so he came in, and as soon as he saw the child, he said the same thing I did, that there's nothing wrong, it's just teething rash, and then Charlotte was reassured.</t4178>
<t4179>"And then, after he left, I suddenly remembered, I don't know how I suddenly thought of this, but I suddenly remembered to ask if he had any strange news.</t4179> <t4180>So when he heard the question, he laughed foolishly, flamboyantly, with a serious expression; then as if he knew something, he finally whispered: 'Because I fear bad news might reach the young ladies staying at your house and cause them to worry about their sister's condition, I think I should let you know, I believe there is nothing to panic about; I hope Mrs. Daswood will recover quickly'."</t4180>
<t4181>- What's wrong? Is Fanny sick</t4181><t4182>?</t4182>
<t4183>- I asked the same thing, ma'am.</t4183> <t4184>I asked: 'My God! Is Mrs. Daswood ill? Then everything became clear; every detail of the matter, everything I heard was like this.</t4184>
<t4185>"Mr. Edward Ferrars, the young man I often jokingly paired with you (but then, I was incredibly relieved that nothing came of it), Mr. Edward Ferrars, it turns out, has been engaged for over twelve months to my cousin Lucy! There, did you hear that! - and no one knew anything about it, except Nancy!"</t4185> <t4186>Can you believe this?</t4186> <t4187>It's not surprising if they love each other; the thing is, they kept it secret when they should have made it public, so no one knew anything at all! That's truly astonishing!</t4187> <t4188>I had never seen the two of them together, otherwise I surely would have known."</t4188>
<t4189>"Hey, so this is a big secret, because of fear of Mrs. Ferrars; both she and her siblings didn't know a thing, until this morning, poor Nancy - as you know, she's straightforward but not very clever - blurted out everything.</t4189> <t4190>Imagine she thought to herself: 'My God! They all love Lucy, surely they won't cause any trouble', and so, she went to her sister-in-law who was sitting alone knitting a rug, while the sister-in-law had no idea what was about to happen; because just five minutes earlier, her sister-in-law had told her brother she planned to matchmake Edward with the daughter of some Duke, I forget who."</t4190>
<t4191>"So you can imagine what a blow it was to Miss Daswood's vanity and pride.</t4191> <t4192>She immediately flew into a frenzy, screaming so loudly that her brother, who was sitting in the family room downstairs writing a letter to his steward in the countryside, heard her.</t4192> <t4193>He rushed upstairs, and a scene of horror unfolded, as Lucy, who couldn't fathom what was happening, ran in.</t4193> <t4194>Poor thing!"</t4194>
<t4195>"I feel sorry for her.</t4195> <t4196>And I dare say, she was terribly mistreated; for her sister-in-law scolded her fiercely, and soon after made her faint.</t4196> <t4197>As for Nancy, she was kneeling on the floor, crying bitterly; and her brother was pacing around the room, not knowing what to do. Mrs. Daswood declared that she would not let them stay another minute in the house, and her husband had to kneel on the floor to persuade her to allow them to pack their clothes.</t4197> <t4198>At this moment, Mrs. Daswood had another fit, and he was so frightened that he sent for Mr. Donavan, who found the whole house in chaos.</t4198> <t4199>The carriage was ready at the gate to take my two poor nieces away, and they had just stepped into the carriage when he arrived; he said poor Lucy was in such a weak state that she could barely walk; and Nancy was almost the same.</t4199> <t4200>I must say, I have no patience with her sister-in-law; and with all my heart, I hope that despite her opposition, they still love each other."</t4200>
<t4201>"My God! I can't imagine what poor Edward will do when he hears this news!</t4201> <t4202>Having a lover treated with such contempt! I wouldn't be surprised if he loves her deeply! And Mr. Donavan thinks so too.</t4202> <t4203>He and I have talked a lot about this; and most importantly, he will return to Harley Street, to be there as soon as Mrs. Ferrars finds out, because she was invited right after my two cousins left, as her sister believes she will also have a fit; and as for her, I don't care.</t4203> <t4204>I don't pity these two people.</t4204> <t4205>I have no prejudice about what people should do regarding money and reputation.</t4205> <t4206>There is no reason in the world to prevent Edward and Lucy from getting married; because I am sure Mrs. Ferrars is more than capable of providing for her son; and although Lucy has almost nothing, she knows better than anyone how to manage.</t4206> <t4207>I dare say, if Mrs. Ferrars only gives him five hundred a year, she could make it seem like any other person with eight hundred."</t4207>
<t4208>"Oh my God! How can they live so cozily together in a vacation house like hers - or a little bigger - with two maids and two butlers.</t4208> <t4209>I can help them with a servant, as my Betty has an unemployed sister, so that would be suitable for them."</t4209>
<t4210>At this point, Mrs. Jennings paused, and since Elinor had had enough time to gather her thoughts, she was able to respond to her and make remarks in the manner such a subject required.</t4210> <t4211>She was glad to see that no one suspected her of having any vested interest in the matter; that Mrs. Jennings no longer imagined she had any feelings for Edward (as she often thought the latter had such an idea).</t4211> <t4212>What pleased her most was that, in Marianne's absence, she could speak about the affair without being flustered, believing she could impartially judge everyone involved.</t4212>
<t4213>She found it hard to determine what she truly hoped for from this situation, even though she tried to dismiss the desire for the story to end in any other way than the wedding between Edward and Lucy.</t4213> <t4214>She wanted to hear how Mrs. Ferrars would declare and act, even though she could guess.</t4214> <t4215>She was even more eager to know how Edward would behave.</t4215> <t4216>She felt compassion for him; very little for Lucy - and she was somewhat pained by this very little; for there was nothing for the others.</t4216>
<t4217>Since Mrs. Jennings did not say anything more about the matter, Elinor felt it necessary to prepare Marianne for the conversation.</t4217> <t4218>It was not advisable to waste time deceiving her sister, but rather to inform her of the truth and help her get ready to hear others discuss the matter, while at the same time, she did not want to reveal her own worries to her sister or any dissatisfaction with Edward.</t4218>
<t4219>Her task made her miserable.</t4219> <t4220>She was about to take away what she believed to be her sister's chief comfort, revealing such details about Edward that she feared would entirely lose her sister's affection, and make Marianne recall her own disappointment when her vivid imagination recognized the similarity between their situations.</t4220> <t4221>But no matter how much this might go against anyone's wishes, she had to do it; and so Elinor hurried to get it over with.</t4221> <t4222>She did not want to dwell on her own feelings or show much distress, instead striving to compose herself in the manner she had adopted since first hearing about Edward's engagement; and in doing so, she might imply to Marianne how she should act.</t4222>
<t4223>She recounted the incident to her sister in a clear and simple voice; and although not devoid of emotion, she was neither violently agitated nor deeply distressed.</t4223> <t4224>This reaction belonged to the listener, for Marianne listened in horror and wept bitterly.</t4224> <t4225>Elinor was the one who tried to comfort others about her own sorrow, and had to console no less than when others were sorrowful.</t4225> <t4226>She reassured her sister that her own spirits remained steady, and she did not wish to condemn Edward for any fault except imprudence.</t4226>
<t4227>But for a moment Marianne did not want to believe any of it.</t4227> <t4228>Edward seemed to be a second Willoughby; and although she admitted, like Elinor, that her sister had loved him most sincerely, she thought her sister could still feel less than she did!</t4228> <t4229>As for Lucy Steele, Marianne found her completely unlikable, absolutely lacking in qualities that would make a man of feeling become attached to her, to the point that at first she could not believe Edward had any feelings for her, and then forgave him.</t4229> <t4230>She did not even believe this was a natural occurrence, and Elinor had to persuade her sister that it was indeed so, thereby helping her to better understand human nature.</t4230>
<t4231>The beginning of the story only goes up to the event of the appointment between the two people and the time of the appointment.</t4231> <t4232>Marianne's emotions were abruptly halted.</t4232> <t4233>A period of time after that, Elinor could not continue the story, but could only soothe her sister's distress, prevent her panic, and suppress her discontent.</t4233>
<t4234>The first question from my sister is:</t4234>
<t4235>- Elinor, how long have you known about this?</t4235> <t4236>Did he write you a letter?</t4236>
<t4237>- She has known for four months.</t4237> <t4238>In November, when Lucy first came to Barton Park, she privately informed her about her engagement.</t4238>
<t4239>Her eyes revealed an extreme astonishment that her lips could not express.</t4239> <t4240>After a moment of thought, she exclaimed:</t4240>
<t4241>- Four months! You have known for four months?</t4241>
<t4242>Elinor confirmed it was true.</t4242>
<t4243>- What? You carried it in your heart while taking care of me with all my sorrows, didn't you?</t4243> <t4244>And I blamed you because you were enjoying happiness!</t4244>
<t4245>- It wouldn't be appropriate at that moment to let you know how sad I was!</t4245>
<t4246>Marianne cried out again:</t4246>
<t4247>- Four months!</t4247> <t4248>So calm! So cheerful! How did you manage to lift your spirits?</t4248>
<t4249>- By thinking that you are doing your duty.</t4249> <t4250>The promise to Lucy obliges you to keep the secret.</t4250> <t4251>Therefore, for her sake, you avoid revealing the truth; and for the sake of family and friends, you do not want them to worry about you while you cannot reassure them.</t4251>
<t4252>Marianne appeared deeply moved.</t4252>
<t4253>Elinor added:</t4253>
<t4254>- Many times, I wanted to stop deceiving myself and our mother, and a few times I wanted to make an effort; but if I wanted to keep my promise, I wouldn't know how to say it to make you believe me.</t4254>
<t4255>- Four months!</t4255> <t4256>And yet you love him!</t4256>
<t4257>- Correct.</t4257> <t4258>But she does not love only him; and while she is eager to see others comfortable, she is happy not to let anyone know how she truly feels.</t4258>
<t4259>"Now, I can think and talk about this matter without being too emotional.</t4259> <t4260>I don't want you to be sad because of me, because I want you to believe that I am not suffering much anymore.</t4260> <t4261>I have many things that help lift my spirits.</t4261> <t4262>I am conscious of not causing disappointment because of my own carelessness.</t4262> <t4263>I try to contain all my disappointments within myself and not let them spread out.</t4263> <t4264>I have forgiven Edward for his wrongdoing.</t4264> <t4265>I wish him happiness; and I believe that he always fulfills his duties, so although he may have regrets now, he will eventually be happy.</t4265> <t4266>Lucy is not lacking in awareness, and this is the foundation upon which all good things can be built."</t4266>
<t4267>"After all, Marianne, after all the infatuation with the idea of a single and steadfast engagement, after everything that can be said about the happiness of a person being entirely dependent on someone else, it doesn't mean... it's not necessarily... it doesn't have to be that way.</t4267> <t4268>Edward will marry Lucy; he will marry a woman superior in appearance and only half as empathetic; then time and habit will help him forget that he once thought of someone else superior to her."</t4268>
<t4269>Marianne said:</t4269>
<t4270>- If this is your way of thinking, if losing something most precious is easily compensated by something else, perhaps it is not surprising about your decisiveness, your self-restraint.</t4270> <t4271>I can understand that.</t4271>
<t4272>- I understand you.</t4272> <t4273>You don't think I have many feelings.</t4273> <t4274>Marianne, for the past four months, I have carried all the emotions heavily in my mind without being able to comfortably confide in anyone; knowing that if I explained, it would cause you and mother pain, and I couldn't prepare you to accept it.</t4274>
<t4275>"She heard - she was forced to hear - from that very person, about the prior engagement that had shattered all her prospects; and moreover, it was recounted to her in the manner of a victor.</t4275> <t4276>Therefore, she had to suppress this person's suspicions by pretending to be indifferent while she was deeply concerned.</t4276> <t4277>And it wasn't just once; she had to listen repeatedly to their ambitions and triumphs."</t4277>
<t4278>"In her heart, she knew she would be permanently separated from Edward, yet there was no situation that could make her less eager to be united with him.</t4278> <t4279>There was nothing to suggest he was despicable, and nothing to show he was indifferent to her.</t4279> <t4280>She had to endure the rudeness of his sister and the contempt of his mother, and suffered because she harbored feelings without ever enjoying the benefits those feelings could bring.</t4280> <t4281>And all of this happened during a time when she had to bear another sorrow, as you know."</t4281>
<t4282>"If you think about when I might have had feelings, you can surely guess that I am suffering now.</t4282> <t4283>A calm mind to dissect the issue now, a comforted heart after a full confession, all are the results of long-term and painful endurance; not something that bursts forth; not an outburst to relieve the spirit, no, Marianne.</t4283> <t4284>At that time, if I hadn't been compelled to keep it secret because of a promise, perhaps nothing could have completely prevented me - not even concern for loved ones - from openly showing that I was very distressed."</t4284>
<t4285>Marianne calmed down.</t4285> <t4286>She exclaimed:</t4286>
<t4287>- Oh! Elinor! You have made me despise myself forever.</t4287> <t4288>I have treated you so cruelly! You - my only source of comfort, the one who has endured all suffering with me - seemingly suffering only because of me!</t4288> <t4289>Is this how I repay you?</t4289> <t4290>Is this the only way I can respond to you?</t4290> <t4291>Because your dignity calls upon me to lift myself up, while I have tried to prevent you from advising me.</t4291>
<t4292>The two sisters showed affection for each other after this confession.</t4292> <t4293>In her sister's state of mind, it wasn't difficult for Elinor to ask her to keep any promise.</t4293> <t4294>She asked Marianne never to show even a little bitterness to anyone when talking about the matter; - to promise not to show even a little resentment when meeting Lucy; - and also to promise to still treat Edward as kindly as before if fate brought them together again.</t4294> <t4295>These were significant concessions; but once Marianne realized her sister was hurt, she wanted to make amends in any way she could.</t4295>
<t4296>Marianne faithfully kept her promise to remain discreet.</t4296> <t4297>She accepted everything Mrs. Jennings said about the matter with an unchanged expression, never contradicting her, and three times she responded, "Yes, ma'am."</t4297> <t4298>She listened to Mrs. Jennings praise Lucy by simply moving to sit in another chair, and when she spoke about Edward's feelings, she only slightly choked up.</t4298> <t4299>Such heroic actions helped Elinor remain calm about everything.</t4299>
<t4300>The next morning brought further challenges, as the half-brother visited with the most serious demeanor to discuss the terrible incident and inform everyone about his wife.</t4300>
<t4301>As soon as he sat down, he spoke very solemnly:</t4301>
<t4302>- I think you two have heard about the big incident that happened in our house yesterday.</t4302>
<t4303>Everyone seemed to affirm; it seemed like this moment was too uncomfortable to put into words.</t4303>
<t4304>He continued:</t4304>
<t4305>- Your sister has suffered terribly.</t4305> <t4306>Mrs. Ferrars too - in short, this is the most complicated and sorrowful situation.</t4306> <t4307>But he hopes the storm will pass without any of us having to endure it.</t4307> <t4308>Poor Fanny!</t4308> <t4309>She has been hysterical all day.</t4309>
<t4310>"But he doesn't want you two to worry too much.</t4310> <t4311>Donavan said there's nothing important to worry about; your sister has good physical health and a determination that matches anyone's.</t4311> <t4312>She has endured everything with the resilience of an angel!</t4312> <t4313>She said she would never think well of anyone again; and no one can blame her for this sentiment after being deceived so much! - encountering ingratitude after showing all kindness, after placing such trust! It was her generous spirit that led her to invite these two young ladies to stay with her; just because she thought they needed care, were harmless, had good character, and would make pleasant company; otherwise, both she and her brother would have invited you and Marianne to stay with them while your aunt was busy caring for her daughter.</t4313>
<t4314>"And now this is how we are repaid!"</t4314> <t4315>Poor Fanny affectionately said, 'With all my heart, I wish we had invited the two sisters instead of those two ladies.'</t4315>
<t4316>Upon arriving here, he paused to wait for a thank you.</t4316> <t4317>He heard the thank you, then continued:</t4317>
<t4318>- It is impossible to describe how much poor Mrs. Ferrars suffered when Fanny told her.</t4318> <t4319>While, through the most sincere affection, she was preparing the most proper marriage for him, how could she think that he would secretly engage with someone else! This idea never crossed her mind! If she had any suspicions somewhere, she could not have thought it would be here.</t4319> <t4320>She said: 'Here, I think I am at ease.'</t4320>
<t4321>"She was very sad.</t4321> <t4322>However, they discussed with each other what to do, and finally she decided to call Edward over.</t4322> <t4323>He came.</t4323> <t4324>But he regretted having to tell what happened next."</t4324>
<t4325>"Mrs. Ferrars only asked him to end the engagement, and he helped her by giving additional opinions as you two might guess, and Fanny also pleaded, but to no avail.</t4325> <t4326>Duty, affection, everything was disregarded.</t4326> <t4327>He had never seen Edward so obstinate and unfeeling before.</t4327> <t4328>Fanny's mother informed him about her generous plans in case he married Miss Morton; she told him she would transfer the Norfolk estate inheritance to him, providing a thousand a year after land taxes."</t4328>
<t4329>"When the situation became desperate, she raised it to one thousand two hundred.</t4329> <t4330>If he still resisted and clung to such a lowly relationship, she made him clearly aware of the destitution that would accompany this marriage.</t4330> <t4331>She said she would only give him two thousand pounds; would never see him again; and from then on she would support him very little, to the extent that if he wanted to pursue any career, she would use all her power to hinder his advancement."</t4331>
<t4332>Reaching this point, in a fit of rage, her hands clenched, Marianne exclaimed:</t4332>
<t4333>- Oh my God! How can this be possible?</t4333>
<t4334>The older brother replied:</t4334>
<t4335>- Marianne, I know you are surprised by the stubborn attitude against such solid arguments.</t4335> <t4336>Your reaction is completely natural.</t4336>
<t4337>Marianne intended to retaliate, but she remembered her promises and restrained herself.</t4337>
<t4338>He continued:</t4338>
<t4339>- However, all these actions are futile.</t4339> <t4340>Edward spoke very little, but when he did, it was in the most resolute manner.</t4340> <t4341>Nothing could make him abandon his commitment.</t4341> <t4342>He would be steadfast, no matter the cost.</t4342>
<t4343>Unable to keep silent any longer, Mrs. Jennings bluntly exclaimed:</t4343>
<t4344>- In that case, he acted like a sincere person.</t4344> <t4345>Mr. Daswood, excuse me, but if he had acted otherwise, I would think he was a scoundrel.</t4345> <t4346>Like you, I am not much involved in this matter; but Lucy Steele is my cousin, and I believe there is no better girl in this world, and no one more deserving of a decent husband.</t4346>
<t4347>John Daswood was extremely surprised; but his nature was calm, not easily provoked, and he never wanted to offend anyone, especially someone with considerable property.</t4347> <t4348>Therefore, he replied without any sign of annoyance:</t4348>
<t4349>- Madam, I had no intention of being disrespectful to any of your relatives.</t4349> <t4350>I am well aware that Miss Lucy Steele is a very worthy woman; but you know, in this case, such a union is impossible.</t4350> <t4351>And to enter into an engagement with a young man under the guardianship of his uncle, with the son of a mother like Mrs. Ferrars who has a very large fortune, it all seems rather unusual.</t4351>
<t4352>"In short, Mrs. Jennings, I do not intend to criticize the character of anyone you hold dear.</t4352> <t4353>We all wish her much happiness; and Mrs. Ferrars' attitude throughout the matter has been like that of any devoted mother reacting in a similar situation.</t4353> <t4354>This character is dignified and generous.</t4354> <t4355>Edward has chosen his path, and I fear it will be a bad one."</t4355>
<t4356>Marianne sighed with a similar worry.</t4356> <t4357>Elinor's heart tightened because of Edward's state of mind while resisting his mother's threats, and also because of a woman who could not make up for him.</t4357>
<t4358>Mrs. Jennings asked:</t4358>
<t4359>- So, how did the matter end?</t4359>
<t4360>- Madam, I am very sorry to say, it ended in the most unfortunate breakup - Edward will never again be cared for by his mother.</t4360> <t4361>He left his mother's house yesterday, but where he went or whether he is still in the city, I do not know; because of course, we cannot inquire.</t4361>
<t4362>- Poor young brother!</t4362> <t4363>And then what will happen to him?</t4363>
<t4364>- Madam, it is indeed true! It is quite sad.</t4364> <t4365>Born with such prospects of wealth! I cannot imagine a worse situation.</t4365> <t4366>The interest from two thousand pounds - how can a man live on that! Moreover, when thinking that if not for folly, within three months he could receive two thousand five hundred per year (since Miss Morton has thirty thousand pounds), I cannot picture a more miserable situation.</t4366> <t4367>Everyone must feel sympathy for him, and even more so because we are unable to offer him any assistance.</t4367>
<t4368>Mrs. Jennings exclaimed:</t4368>
<t4369>- Poor young brother!</t4369> <t4370>I can certainly invite him to eat and stay at my house, and if I meet him, I will say so.</t4370> <t4371>Now, letting him live solely on his income, in rented houses and inns, is not right at all.</t4371>
<t4372>Elinor's mind silently thanked her for being so kind to Edward, but she couldn't suppress a smile at her manner of support.</t4372>
<t4373>John Daswood said:</t4373>
<t4374>- If he could just manage well on his own, with all his friends helping him, he wouldn't be struggling so much and wouldn't lack anything now.</t4374> <t4375>But indeed, it's too much for everyone to help him.</t4375> <t4376>And there's one more thing awaiting him, the worst of all: his mother has decided, quite naturally, to immediately transfer the inheritance of that property to Robert - which should have belonged to Edward - through legal procedures.</t4376> <t4377>I spoke with the mother's lawyer about this matter before coming here.</t4377>
<t4378>Mrs. Jennings said:</t4378>
<t4379>- There, she takes revenge in that way.</t4379> <t4380>Everyone has their own way.</t4380> <t4381>But I don't think I would use this way to make a son independent because someone is bothering me.</t4381>
<t4382>Marianne stood up and walked around the room.</t4382>
<t4383>John continued:</t4383>
<t4384>- What could hurt a man's pride more than seeing his younger brother own an estate that should have been his?</t4384> <t4385>Poor Edward!</t4385> <t4386>I feel so much sympathy for him.</t4386>
<t4387>Add a few more minutes to express his feelings in such a heartfelt way, then he bid farewell, reiterating his reassurance to his two younger sisters that he was certain there was nothing dangerous about Fanny's condition, and therefore they should not worry.</t4387> <t4388>He left, leaving the three women united in their feelings about the current situation, at least regarding the character of Mrs. Ferrars, the Daswood couple, and Edward.</t4388>
<t4389>Just after he left the room, Marianne burst into contempt.</t4389> <t4390>Because her aggressive posture made it impossible for Elinor to be cautious, and Mrs. Jennings did not need to be cautious, they together very enthusiastically criticized those people.</t4390>
<t4391>Chapter 38</t4391>
<t4392>Mrs. Jennings warmly praised Edward's character, but only Elinor and Marianne truly understood his genuine worth. Both sisters knew that he had little to rely on for rebellion, and not much comfort either, but it was merely his remaining sense of duty that drove him to do the right thing amidst the loss of friends and property.</t4392> <t4393>Elinor was proud of his integrity, and Marianne forgave all his faults, feeling compassion for the punishment he had endured.</t4393> <t4394>But even though the public revelation of the matter brought the two sisters closer, when alone, neither of them wanted to dwell on it.</t4394> <t4395>Elinor avoided it on the grounds of principle, which had deepened in her thoughts, while Marianne, with her fervent and unwavering belief that Edward still held feelings for her, made it difficult for Elinor, who wished to move on.</t4395>
<t4396>B</t4396>
<t4397>Before long, Marianne no longer had the courage to discuss the topic that always left her more dissatisfied than ever when comparing Elinor's character to her own.</t4397> <t4398>She felt the full force of this comparison; but not in the way her sister hoped, wanting her to be more self-controlled now; instead, she blamed herself in sorrow, bitterly regretting her previous lack of self-control; but this only tormented her with remorse without any hope of rectification.</t4398> <t4399>Her spirits declined to the point where she thought she could no longer control herself, which only further demoralized her.</t4399>
<t4400>In the next one or two days, they did not hear any new news about the situation at Harley Street or Barlett Building.</t4400> <t4401>But although she already knew a lot, enough for Mrs. Jennings to spread the information further without needing to know more, she still wanted to visit to comfort and inquire about her nieces as soon as possible; and during this time, nothing prevented her from doing so except being busier than usual with more visitors.</t4401>
<t4402>The next day was a beautiful Sunday that attracted many people to Kensington Park, even though it was only the second week of March. Mrs. Jennings and Elinor were among these people.</t4402> <t4403>As for Marianne, knowing that the Willoughbys had come to town and always feeling shy about encountering them, preferred to stay home rather than go to such a public place.</t4403>
<t4404>A close friend of Mrs. Jennings accompanied them after the two and the Park, and Elinor was pleased to see the friend strike up a conversation with Mrs. Jennings, allowing her to ponder in silence.</t4404> <t4405>She found nothing related to the Willoughbys, to Edward, and for a moment, nothing related to anyone who might accidentally catch her attention, whether sad or happy.</t4405> <t4406>But eventually, she was surprised to meet Miss Steele, who, though appearing shy, seemed very happy to see them again, and when Mrs. Jennings kindly encouraged her, she separated from her group to go with them.</t4406>
<t4407>Mrs. Jennings immediately whispered to Elinor:</t4407>
<t4408>- Dear niece, probe her.</t4408> <t4409>If you ask, she will tell everything.</t4409> <t4410>You see, I can't separate from Mrs. Clark.</t4410>
<t4411>However, fortunately for Mrs. Jennings's curiosity and also for Elinor's, she spoke out without anyone needing to ask, otherwise they would not have known anything.</t4411>
<t4412>Miss Steele took Elinor's arm:</t4412>
<t4413>- I am very happy to see you again, because you are the person I most look forward to meeting in the world.</t4413>
<t4414>Then she lowered her voice:</t4414>
<t4415>- I guess she already knows everything about the story.</t4415> <t4416>Is she angry?</t4416>
<t4417>- I believe she is not angry with you two.</t4417>
<t4418>- That's good.</t4418> <t4419>What about Mrs. Middleton, is she angry?</t4419>
<t4420>- I can't imagine she could be angry again.</t4420>
<t4421>- I am tremendously happy.</t4421> <t4422>Thank heavens! I have gone through an ordeal!</t4422> <t4423>I have never seen Lucy so furious in my life.</t4423> <t4424>At first, she swore she wouldn't make a new hat for me, or do anything for me anymore; but now my sister has calmed down quite a bit, and we are as good sisters as ever.</t4424> <t4425>Look, last night she helped make the bow for my hat and attached the feathers to it.</t4425>
<t4426>"Oh dear, even you are about to mock me.</t4426> <t4427>But why shouldn't I wear those pink ribbons? I don't care even if it is indeed the Doctor's favorite color.</t4427> <t4428>As for me, I would never have known that he truly likes this color more than any other, if he hadn't happened to say so.</t4428> <t4429>My cousins keep teasing me endlessly!</t4429> <t4430>Sometimes in front of them, I don't know which way to look."</t4430>
<t4431>She had wandered into a topic that Elinor had nothing to say about, so it wasn't long before she found it better to steer back to the old subject.</t4431> <t4432>She triumphantly said:</t4432>
<t4433>- Hey, Miss Daswood, people can talk all they want about Mrs. Ferrars declaring that he will leave Lucy, but I can tell you that it won't happen; and it's really shameful that such malicious news is spreading everywhere.</t4433> <t4434>You know, no matter what Lucy thinks about this, others have no business jumping to definite conclusions.</t4434>
<t4435>Elinor said:</t4435>
<t4436>- I haven't heard any such rumors, please believe me.</t4436>
<t4437>- Oh, you really didn't hear?</t4437> <t4438>But people have said so, you know, said it many times, and more than once; because Miss Godby told Miss Sparks that no one in their right mind would think Mr. Ferrars would give up someone like Miss Morton, with a fortune of thirty thousand pounds, for Lucy Steele who has nothing at all, and I myself heard Miss Sparks say so.</t4438>
<t4439>"And besides that, it was my cousin Richard who said that there would come a time when he feared Mr. Ferrars would distance himself, and when Edward did not come near us for three days, I did not know what to think; and deep down I believed Lucy was in despair; because we left her brother's house on Wednesday, and heard nothing about him on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, not knowing how he was."</t4439>
<t4440>"There was a moment when Lucy intended to write to him, but my sister's spirit restrained this.</t4440> <t4441>However, this morning he came right when we returned from church, and then we learned everything, how on Wednesday he was called to Harley Street, how his mother and everyone talked to him, and how he declared in front of them that he loved no one but Lucy and would marry no one but Lucy.</t4441> <t4442>And then how worried he was about what had happened, so much so that even as he left his mother's house, he jumped on his horse and rode out into the countryside, somewhere; and how he stayed at an inn all Thursday and Friday to calm himself down."</t4442>
<t4443>"And he said, after much thought, he realized that now he has no assets, nothing at all, it would be cruel to keep the engagement with my sister because she would suffer losses, as he has nothing but two thousand pounds, no hope for anything else; and if he were ordained as he once thought, he would get nothing except a vicar's position, then how could they live on that income?</t4443> <t4444>He couldn't bear the thought that my sister wouldn't be any better off, so he pleaded, if she thought it over a bit, she would end the relationship and let him fend for himself."</t4444>
<t4445>"I heard him say everything as clearly as that.</t4445> <t4446>It was all because of her, caring for her that he spoke words of finality, not because of himself.</t4446> <t4447>I can swear he never said anything about being tired of my sister, or having any intention of marrying Miss Morton, or anything like that.</t4447> <t4448>But, surely, Lucy didn't want to hear anything in such a manner; so my sister immediately told him (with all the romance and emotion, you know, everything like that.</t4448> <t4449>Oh dear!</t4449> <t4450>We can't repeat these things, you know) - my sister immediately told him, the girl wasn't shy at all, that she could live with him on a small allowance, and no matter how little he had, she would gladly accept it all, you know, something like that.</t4450> <t4451>So he was incredibly happy, they discussed for a long time what they should do, and then they agreed he should be ordained immediately, and they would wait until he received his salary."</t4451>
<t4452>"And just at that moment, I couldn't hear anything more, because my cousin called up from downstairs to let me know that Mrs. Richardson had come by car to take one of us to Kensington Park; so I had to go in and interrupt to ask Lucy if she wanted to go, but she didn't want to leave Edward; so I ran upstairs, put on my silk stockings, and went out with the Richardsons."</t4452>
<t4453>Elinor said:</t4453>
<t4454>- I don't understand what you mean when you say interrupting them, all three of them were in the same room, right?</t4454>
<t4455>- No, actually not.</t4455> <t4456>Oh dear! Miss Daswood, do you think people would flirt with each other when someone else is right next to them? Oh! How embarrassing! Surely you must know better than that (laughs affectionately).</t4456> <t4457>No, no, they whisper to each other in the family room, and all I could hear was at the door.</t4457>
<t4458>Elinor exclaimed:</t4458>
<t4459>- So that's it! You mean you only found out by eavesdropping at the door?</t4459> <t4460>I apologize for not knowing beforehand, because I certainly don't want to trouble you by asking you to recount the details of a conversation you weren't supposed to know about.</t4460> <t4461>How could you treat your sister so unfairly?</t4461>
<t4462>- Oh dear, it's nothing in this matter.</t4462> <t4463>I just stood at the door, listening to whatever I could hear.</t4463> <t4464>And I'm sure Lucy could do the same with me; because one or two years ago, when Martha Sharpe and I had many secrets together, the little one didn't hesitate to hide in the wardrobe or behind the chimney to eavesdrop on us.</t4464>
<t4465>Elinor tried to change the subject; but Miss Steele could not stay away for more than a few minutes, and soon returned to the topic that occupied most of her mind.</t4465>
<t4466>Ms. Steele said:</t4466>
<t4467>- Edward said he would go to Oxford one day soon, but right now he is staying at No. -, Pall Mall. His mother is really cruel, isn't she?</t4467> <t4468>Your brother and sister-in-law are not good either!</t4468>
<t4469>"However, I will not speak ill of them to you; and to be fair, they brought my sister and me home in their carriage, which exceeded my expectations.</t4469> <t4470>As for myself, I was constantly nervous because I feared that your sister-in-law would ask for the handicrafts she had given us one or two days before.</t4470> <t4471>But I heard nothing, and I had to carefully hide them."</t4471>
<t4472>"Edward said he had business in Oxford, so he has to go now, and later when he can get a bishop to sponsor him, he could be ordained.</t4472> <t4473>I'm curious to know which parish he will be appointed to!"</t4473>
<t4474>"Heavens! (giggles while speaking) I would bet my life that I know what my cousins would say when they hear about this.</t4474> <t4475>They would tell me to write a letter to the Doctor, to find Edward a parish to live in.</t4475> <t4476>I know they would say that, but I won't do such a thing.</t4476> <t4477>I would say: 'Oh my!'</t4477> <t4478>I wonder why people come up with such ideas!'</t4478> <t4479>Hmph, me writing a letter to the Doctor!"</t4479>
<t4480>Elinor said:</t4480>
<t4481>- Ah, it is indeed reassuring to be prepared for the worst-case scenario.</t4481> <t4482>She already had an answer ready.</t4482>
<t4483>Ms. Steele intended to respond on the same topic, but as her group had arrived, it was necessary to switch to another subject.</t4483>
<t4484>- Ah, look! The Richardsons have arrived.</t4484> <t4485>I have so much more to say to you, but I can't stay away from them any longer.</t4485> <t4486>They are very gentle people.</t4486> <t4487>He makes a lot of money, and they have their own carriage.</t4487> <t4488>I don't have time to speak with Mrs. Jennings myself, but please tell her that I am very happy to hear she is not upset with us, and Lady Middleton as well.</t4488> <t4489>If you and your sister need to go anywhere, and Mrs. Jennings wants company, we would be very happy to stay with her for as long as she wishes.</t4489> <t4490>I guess Lady Middleton wouldn't want my sister and me to come anymore.</t4490> <t4491>Goodbye, I regret not meeting Marianne here.</t4491> <t4492>Please send her my regards.</t4492> <t4493>Oh dear!</t4493> <t4494>If you aren't wearing a muslin dress with dots! I wonder why you aren't afraid it will tear.</t4494>
<t4495>Those were the concerns when she bid farewell; because after that she only had time to say a few words of goodbye to Mrs. Jennings before leaving with Mrs. Richardson, while Elinor had more information to help her think, though she only learned very little more than what she had anticipated and planned in her mind.</t4495> <t4496>The marriage between Edward and Lucy had been firmly established, and the timing was still completely uncertain just as she had concluded; everything depended on him being ordained just as she had thought; but at this moment, it seemed there was no chance.</t4496>
<t4497>As soon as they returned to the carriage, Mrs. Jennings was eager to know the news; but since Elinor wanted to say as little as possible about the information initially gathered in an improper manner, she only briefly recounted a few simple details that she believed Lucy wanted everyone to know to benefit her later.</t4497> <t4498>She only mentioned the fact that they continued their engagement and the conditions that needed to be met for them to reach their goal.</t4498>
<t4499>Mrs. Jennings remarked:</t4499>
<t4500>- Just wait and see how he does as a clergyman! Yes, we all know how this will end: they will wait twelve months, then seeing no good outcome, will accept a position in the parish with fifty pounds a year, plus the interest from his two thousand pounds, and a little bit that Mr. Steele and Mr. Pratt can give her.</t4500> <t4501>Then they will have one child every year! And how poor they will be, only heaven can save them! I must see what I can get for them to furnish their house.</t4501> <t4502>Two maids and two stewards, you say! - as I mentioned the other day.</t4502> <t4503>No, no, they must hire a stout woman to do everything.</t4503> <t4504>Now Betty's sister will never work for them.</t4504>
<t4505>The next day brought Elinor a letter from Lucy. The content was as follows:</t4505>
<t4506>Bartlett Building, March I hope my dear Miss Daswood will forgive me for writing to her without prior notice; but I know her friendship for me will make her happy to hear the good news between my dear Edward and me, along with all the troubles we have recently gone through. Therefore, I will not apologize further, but simply say, thank God! Although we have suffered terribly, we are now quite stable, and we are as happy as we have always been in the love we share.</t4506> <t4507>We have gone through great trials and persecutions, yet at the same time, we deeply appreciate our friends, especially you, for your boundless kindness which I will always remember with gratitude, and so will Edward, as I have told him about it.</t4507>
<t4508>I believe you, and dear Mrs. Jennings as well, will be very happy to know that yesterday afternoon I had two hours of happiness with him. He did not want to hear of our parting even though I was eager to suggest it, as I felt it was my duty to urge it for his sake, and I would have parted with him then and there if he had agreed; but he said never, he did not care about his mother's anger as long as he had my love. Our prospects are not bright, certainly, but we must wait and hope for the best. He will be ordained soon; and if you have the ability to introduce him to someone who can offer him a position, I believe you will not forget us, and dear Mrs. Jennings as well, I believe, will speak well of us to Sir John, or Mrs. Palmer, or any friend who might be able to assist us.</t4508>
<t4509>Poor Anne is to be blamed for what she did, but she meant well, so I said nothing; I hope Mrs. Jennings will not be too inconvenienced to visit us if she happens to pass by one morning, it would be very kind, and my cousins would be honored to make her acquaintance.</t4509>
<t4510>The pages of my letter are full; please send my respectful gratitude to you, Sir John, Lady Middleton, and the dear children when you have the opportunity to meet them, and send my warm regards to Marianne.</t4510>
<t4511>Sincerely.</t4511>
<t4512>As soon as Elinor finished reading the letter, she concluded the true intention of the writer, so she placed the letter in Mrs. Jennings' hands.</t4512> <t4513>She read it aloud with many satisfied remarks and praises.</t4513>
<t4514>- That's great!</t4514> <t4515>How well she writes! Yes, it is proper to let him go if he wants.</t4515> <t4516>That's Lucy's nature. Poor thing!</t4516> <t4517>In my heart, I wish I could find him a position as a clergyman.</t4517> <t4518>Look, she calls me "dear</t4518> <t4519>Mrs. Jennings".</t4519> <t4520>She is a person with a good heart.</t4520> <t4521>Very well, I say this with honor.</t4521> <t4522>This sentence is very well written.</t4522> <t4523>Alright, alright, I will visit her, certainly.</t4523> <t4524>She is so thoughtful, thinking of everyone!</t4524> <t4525>Thank you, my dear, for letting me read it.</t4525> <t4526>A letter as good as this, I have never seen, showing what kind of mind and soul Lucy has.</t4526>
<t4527>Chapter 39</t4527>
<t4528>The two Dashwood sisters had now been in town for over two months, and every day Marianne grew more eager to return.</t4528> <t4529>She longed for the air, the free life, and the tranquility of the countryside; and believed that if there was any place that could bring her peace, it was Barton.</t4529> <t4530>Elinor was equally eager, but hesitated because she considered the difficulties of such a long journey that Marianne could not foresee.</t4530> <t4531>However, she began to seriously consider the possibility and mentioned their desire to their kind hostess.</t4531> <t4532>The lady objected with all the eloquence of good intentions, then proposed a plan that would keep them for a few more weeks, but seemed acceptable to Elinor.</t4532> <t4533>At the end of March, Mr. and Mrs. Palmer would go to Cleveland for the Easter holidays; and Mrs. Jennings, along with her two granddaughters, received a very earnest invitation from Charlotte to join them.</t4533> <t4534>The invitation itself was not enough to satisfy Miss Dashwood's delicacy; - but Mr. Palmer added his genuine politeness, with an increased sincerity since they had learned of her sister's distressing situation.</t4534> <t4535>Thus, she gladly accepted the invitation.</t4535>
<t4536>H</t4536>
<t4537>However, when she talked to Marianne, the first response she received was not very favorable.</t4537>
<t4538>Marianne exclaimed in agitation:</t4538>
<t4539>- Cleveland! No, I can't go to Cleveland.</t4539>
<t4540>Elinor gently:</t4540>
<t4541>- I forgot, but the location... is not close to -</t4541>
<t4542>- But it is close to Somersetshire...</t4542> <t4543>I cannot go to Somersetshire...</t4543> <t4544>That is the place I have longed to go to...</t4544> <t4545>No, Elinor, you cannot expect me to go there.</t4545>
<t4546>Elinor could not argue that her sister should behave properly and overcome such feelings; she could only try to counterbalance with other arguments.</t4546> <t4547>She explained that this plan would set the time for returning to their dear mother, whom her sister was eager to see again, in a more suitable and comfortable manner than any other plan, and perhaps without much delay.</t4547> <t4548>From Cleverland, being only a few miles from Bristol, the journey to Barton would take no more than a day; and their mother's servants could easily come there to pick them up, and since there was no chance of staying at Cleverland for more than a week, the two sisters could be home in just over three weeks.</t4548> <t4549>Marianne's sincere affection for her mother easily overcame all the negative aspects that her sister had merely imagined.</t4549>
<t4550>Not yet tired of guests, Mrs. Jennings eagerly invited the two sisters to return with her from Cleveland.</t4550> <t4551>Elinor thanked her for the concern, but could not change the plans: their mother had approved, and everything related to the return trip home had been arranged.</t4551> <t4552>As for Marianne, she found a little relief in thinking about the short time separating her from Barton.</t4552>
<t4553>When the Colonel came to visit, Mrs. Jennings said:</t4553>
<t4554>- Hey! Colonel, I don't know what you and I will do without the two Miss Daswoods here, because they are determined to go back home; and how lonely we will be when I return! Good Lord!</t4554> <t4555>We will sit and yawn together in boredom like two cats.</t4555>
<t4556>Through the vivid sketch of their future boredom, perhaps Mrs. Jennings hoped he would reveal his thoughts so he could escape it.</t4556> <t4557>If so, she soon had good reason to think her goal had been achieved; for when Elinor went to the window to measure a drawing she was going to copy for her friend, he followed her with a look that conveyed a particular meaning, then conversed with her for a few minutes.</t4557> <t4558>The effect of his words did not escape her observation, for although she was too honorable to intentionally eavesdrop, even when she moved to sit next to the piano where Marianne was playing with the purpose of not hearing, she still kept an eye on them and saw Elinor blushing, looking agitated, and too engrossed in his words to continue her work.</t4558> <t4559>Still wanting to confirm her hopes, during the time Marianne transitioned from one piece to another, a few of the Colonel's words inevitably reached her ears, from which it seemed he was apologizing for the house being too poor.</t4559>
<t4560>This definitely determines the case.</t4560> <t4561>She wondered why he thought it necessary to say so, but guessed it was proper etiquette.</t4561> <t4562>She couldn't hear how Elinor responded, but judging by the way her lips moved, she didn't think it was a significant obstacle; and in her heart, Mrs. Jennings praised her for being so honest.</t4562> <t4563>Then they continued to talk for a few more minutes, during which she couldn't hear a word, and when Marianne's music stopped, she heard the Colonel's calm voice:</t4563>
<t4564>- I'm afraid this matter cannot proceed quickly.</t4564>
<t4565>Surprised and shocked by the statement that did not seem to come from someone in love, she almost exclaimed: "Oh my God! What's the obstacle!" - but she restrained herself.</t4565> <t4566>"This is so strange!</t4566> <t4567>Surely you don't need to wait until you get older."</t4567>
<t4568>However, the delay on the Colonel's part did not seem to offend or humiliate the beautiful niece at all, because after the two ended their exchange and said goodbye, she clearly heard Elinor say, in a tone that revealed her feelings as she spoke:</t4568>
<t4569>- I will always consider myself deeply indebted to you.</t4569>
<t4570>Mrs. Jennings was pleased with her gratitude, and only found it puzzling that after hearing such a statement, the Colonel could bid farewell with such extreme calmness and leave without responding!</t4570> <t4571>She had not thought her old friend to be someone who pursued love so indifferently.</t4571>
<t4572>What really happened between the two of them was like this-</t4572>
<t4573>With deep compassion, he said:</t4573>
<t4574>- I heard that your friend Ferrars has suffered injustice from his family; because if I understand correctly, he was completely disowned by his family for wanting to keep his engagement with a very deserving young woman.</t4574> <t4575>Did I hear correctly?</t4575> <t4576>Is that the case?</t4576>
<t4577>Elinor confirmed to him that it was true:</t4577>
<t4578>With full of emotion, he replied:</t4578>
<t4579>- The cruel attitude - cruel and misguided - it is truly terrible to separate or seek ways to separate two young people who have long been attached to each other.</t4579> <t4580>Mrs. Ferrars does not know what she is doing - where she will push her child.</t4580> <t4581>I have met Mr. Ferrars two or three times on Harley Street, and I like him very much.</t4581> <t4582>He is not the kind of young man one can become close to in a short time, but I have come to understand him enough to wish him all the best, and since he is your friend, I want to wish him even more.</t4582>
<t4583>"I understand that you intend to be ordained.</t4583> <t4584>Please tell him that the clerical position at Delaford, which I received news today has just become vacant, is reserved for him, if he thinks it worthy of his acceptance; but this... perhaps his situation is unfortunate, though it may be meaningless to doubt; I only wish it had higher value.</t4584> <t4585>This is an income for a pastor, but it's small; I believe the current holder does not receive more than two hundred pounds a year, and though it certainly has the potential to increase, I fear it will still not be enough to provide a very comfortable income for him.</t4585> <t4586>However, even so, I am very happy to reserve it for him.</t4586> <t4587>Please convey this news to him."</t4587>
<t4588>If the Colonel had actually proposed to her, Elinor's surprise could hardly have been greater than it was at this moment.</t4588> <t4589>The appointment, which just two days ago she considered hopeless for Edward, was now being offered so that he could marry.</t4589> <t4590>And among all the people in the world, it was she who was designated to bestow it!</t4590> <t4591>Mrs. Jennings had noticed her emotional state, but attributed it to a different cause.</t4591>
<t4592>Although there were some impure and less joyful feelings mixed in with her emotions, she still deeply and warmly felt a sense of respect for the virtue and gratitude for the kind gesture of Colonel.</t4592> <t4593>She thanked him with all her heart, speaking of Edward's principles and temperament with the praise she knew he deserved.</t4593> <t4594>She promised to gladly carry out the task he entrusted to her, if he truly wanted to avoid such a pleasant duty but instead asked someone else.</t4594> <t4595>But at the same time, she couldn't help but think that no one could do this better than him, and she would be very happy to be excused as she did not want Edward to suffer the burden of owing her.</t4595> <t4596>However, Colonel Brandon refused for a delicate reason, still earnestly wanting the proposal to be passed on to her, so she had no further reason to decline.</t4596> <t4597>She believed Edward was still in the city, and fortunately, she had heard Miss Steele mention his address.</t4597> <t4598>Therefore, she could inform him on the same day.</t4598>
<t4599>After this matter had been arranged, Colonel Brandon began to speak of his advantage in having a respectable and agreeable neighbor like this, and at this moment he expressed his regret that the house was too small and cold, a drawback that Elinor did not consider significant, at least with regard to its size.</t4599>
<t4600>She said:</t4600>
<t4601>- I think the two people do not feel inconvenienced by the small house, because it suits their family and income.</t4601>
<t4602>The Colonel was surprised to see that she still considered Mr. Ferrars' wedding to be a certain result of the appointment, as he did not think the income from the Delaford clergy position was sufficient for the two of them, so he said:</t4602>
<t4603>- This small parish can help Mr. Ferrars live comfortably as a bachelor, but it cannot provide him with the means to marry.</t4603> <t4604>I regret to say that my patronage extends only so far, and my concern cannot go beyond that.</t4604> <t4605>However, if an unexpected opportunity arises that allows me to serve him more, I will reconsider the extent of my support for him.</t4605> <t4606>Indeed, what I am doing at present seems to be nothing, as it helps him very little according to his principles and his sole purpose of happiness.</t4606> <t4607>His wedding is likely far off; at the very least, I fear it cannot proceed quickly.</t4607>
<t4608>This is the statement that offended Mrs. Jennings' sensitive feelings because it was misunderstood.</t4608> <t4609>But Elinor's words of thanks when the two parted, though perhaps general in content, were no less moving and the language no less appropriate than when there was a proposal.</t4609>
<t4610>Chapter 40</t4610>
<t4611>Right after he left, she smiled sharply:</t4611>
<t4612>N</t4612>
<t4613>- Hey, Miss Daswood, I don't want to ask what the Colonel said to you; because even though I sincerely tried not to eavesdrop, I still caught enough words to understand his meaning.</t4613> <t4614>And please believe me, I have never been this pleased in my life, and with all my heart, I wish you happiness.</t4614>
<t4615>Elinor said:</t4615>
<t4616>- Thank you very much, ma'am.</t4616> <t4617>I am very happy about this, and deeply appreciate Colonel Brandon's kindness.</t4617> <t4618>Not many men act as he did.</t4618> <t4619>Few have such a sentimental soul.</t4619> <t4620>I have never been so surprised in my life.</t4620>
<t4621>- Oh my God! Dear niece, you are too modest.</t4621> <t4622>I am not surprised at all, because I have often thought recently that this had to happen.</t4622>
<t4623>- She judged based on her perception of the Colonel's heart, but at the very least, she couldn't foresee the opportunity coming so quickly.</t4623>
<t4624>Mrs. Jennings repeated:</t4624>
<t4625>- Opportunity! Ah! Regarding this, once a man has decided on such a matter, one way or another he will soon find the opportunity.</t4625> <t4626>Alright, dear girl, I wish and wish you more joy; and if there ever was a happy couple on this earth, I will soon know where to find them.</t4626>
<t4627>Elinor smiled gently:</t4627>
<t4628>- I guess, you mean to follow them to Delaford.</t4628>
<t4629>- Yes, my dear granddaughter, I will go.</t4629> <t4630>As for the house not being good, I don't know what the Colonel means, because the house is still as good as I have ever seen it.</t4630>
<t4631>- He said it needs to be repaired.</t4631>
<t4632>- Ah, and whose fault is it then? Why doesn't he fix it?</t4632> <t4633>Who else if not himself?</t4633>
<t4634>The two were interrupted by the servant entering to announce that the carriage was waiting at the door, and she immediately prepared to leave, saying:</t4634>
<t4635>- Hey, dear niece, I have to leave before I can tell half the story.</t4635> <t4636>But we can discuss everything in the evening, as there will be no one around.</t4636> <t4637>I'm not asking you to come with me, because I know for sure your mind is too preoccupied with the matter to want company; and besides, you would probably want to inform your sister about this.</t4637>
<t4638>- Madam, certainly, I will inform Marianne; but at this moment I will not mention it to anyone else.</t4638>
<t4639>Mrs. Jennings appeared quite disappointed:</t4639>
<t4640>- Ah! Alright.</t4640> <t4641>So you don't want me to tell Lucy, because I was planning to go all the way to Holborn today.</t4641>
<t4642>- Madam, no, please do not tell even Lucy. A delay of one day will not be important; and before I write to Mr. Ferrars, I think it is best not to mention this to anyone else.</t4642> <t4643>I will do this immediately.</t4643> <t4644>It is important not to waste time with him, as of course he has many things to do to be ordained.</t4644>
<t4645>This sentence made Mrs. Jennings extremely bewildered.</t4645> <t4646>For a moment, she couldn't understand why it was necessary to write to Mr. Ferrars so urgently about this matter.</t4646> <t4647>But a little thought gave rise to a happy idea, and she exclaimed:</t4647>
<t4648>- Oh ho! I understand you.</t4648> <t4649>Mr. Ferrars is that person.</t4649> <t4650>Then, all the better for him.</t4650> <t4651>Well, surely, he must be ordained to be ready; and I am very pleased to see that things between the two of you have progressed quite far.</t4651> <t4652>But, dear niece, isn't that unusual? Shouldn't the Major write the letter himself?</t4652> <t4653>Indeed, it makes more sense for him to write.</t4653>
<t4654>Elinor did not understand much of Mrs. Jennings' introduction, thinking it wasn't worth asking further, so she only responded to the conclusion:</t4654>
<t4655>- Colonel Brandon is a considerate person, so he wanted to ask someone else to inform Mr. Ferrars of his intentions.</t4655>
<t4656>- And so she was forced to do it.</t4656> <t4657>This is indeed an old-fashioned subtlety! However, I didn't want to disturb her (seeing she was about to write).</t4657> <t4658>She knows better than anyone about her concerns. So, goodbye.</t4658> <t4659>I haven't heard anything that made me this happy since Charlotte was in confinement.</t4659>
<t4660>She left, but in a moment she returned:</t4660>
<t4661>- I was just thinking about Betty's sister.</t4661> <t4662>I would be very happy to find her a good mistress like that.</t4662> <t4663>I can't say whether she would be willing to be a servant or not.</t4663> <t4664>She is an excellent housekeeper, and also very skilled in needlework.</t4664> <t4665>However, she can take her time to think about this.</t4665>
<t4666>Elinor was more eager to be left alone than to be the mistress of the subject, so she did not listen to the rest of the lady's sentence, only responding:</t4666>
<t4667>- Yes, ma'am.</t4667>
<t4668>Now all her thoughts were on how to begin - how she should express herself in her letter to Edward.</t4668> <t4669>The special circumstances between the two of them made this difficult, while for anyone else it would be the easiest thing in the world.</t4669> <t4670>She sat pondering over the paper with a pen in her hand, afraid of saying too much or too little, until she was interrupted by Edward walking in.</t4670>
<t4671>He came to bid a sincere farewell, and met Mrs. Jennings at the door as she was going out to the carriage.</t4671> <t4672>She apologized for not being able to go back inside, invited him in, and said that Miss Dashwood was upstairs and wanted to tell him something very special.</t4672>
<t4673>Amidst the confusion, Elinor was glad that, although it might be difficult to present her case properly in a letter, it was at least better than having to do so through speech.</t4673> <t4674>Just then, her guest entered, forcing her to make her best effort through the more difficult method.</t4674>
<t4675>She was extremely surprised and confused by his unexpected appearance.</t4675> <t4676>She had not seen him since his engagement became public.</t4676> <t4677>Through her consciousness, she had thought about his situation and now, in a few minutes, she was extremely embarrassed about what to say to him.</t4677>
<t4678>He was also very distressed, and they sat down together in the most confused state of mind.</t4678> <t4679>He couldn't remember if he had apologized to her when he first entered uninvited; but to be proper, after sitting down and being able to speak, he apologized.</t4679> <t4680>He said:</t4680>
<t4681>- Mrs. Jennings told me that you wanted to see me, at least that's what I understood her to say; otherwise, I certainly wouldn't have been so abrupt; though at the same time, I would be very sorry to leave London without seeing you and your sister; especially as it might be some time... I might not see you again.</t4681> <t4682>Tomorrow I am going to Oxford.</t4682>
<t4683>Having calmed down and decided to finish as quickly as possible the task she dreaded, Elinor said:</t4683>
<t4684>- However, you cannot leave without receiving our best wishes, even if we cannot wish you directly.</t4684> <t4685>Mrs. Jennings was right.</t4685> <t4686>I have something to inform you about, which I have just begun through correspondence.</t4686>
<t4687>"I have been entrusted with a very pleasing task (breathing faster than usual as she spoke).</t4687> <t4688>Colonel Brandon, who was here just ten minutes ago, asked me to convey that, upon learning of your intention to seek ordination, he is very pleased to recommend you for the clerical position at Delaford which has recently become vacant, and he only wishes it were of higher value."</t4688>
<t4689>"Please allow me to congratulate you on having such a respectable and discerning friend, and I also hope that this position - which brings in about two hundred a year - may improve to the point that it allows you... to the point of more than just temporary stability... in short, to the level that helps you realize all your notions of happiness."</t4689>
<t4690>What Edward felt, when he could not express it himself, nor could he hope for anyone else to speak for him.</t4690> <t4691>He showed a look of surprise at such unexpected information, unable to hope for it, inevitably causing excitement; but he could only say:</t4691>
<t4692>- Colonel Brandon!</t4692>
<t4693>With added calmness because the worst was over, Elinor continued:</t4693>
<t4694>- Yes, Colonel Brandon implied that this was to demonstrate his concern about what had just happened - the cruel situation you fell into due to the unjustifiable attitude of your family - a concern that I am sure Marianne, I, and your friends all share.</t4694> <t4695>This is also evidence that he values your character and appreciates your attitude in the matter.</t4695>
<t4696>- Colonel Brandon offered me a clerical position! Is that even possible?</t4696>
<t4697>- His cruel relatives surprised him by seeing friendship anywhere.</t4697>
<t4698>As consciousness suddenly returned, he replied:</t4698>
<t4699>- No, I am not surprised by you; because I cannot forget that I am indebted to you, indebted to your kindness.</t4699> <t4700>I recognize everything...</t4700> <t4701>I would say it if I could... but, as you know well, I do not have the gift of eloquence.</t4701>
<t4702>- You are mistaken.</t4702> <t4703>I hope you understand that it is entirely - at least almost entirely - due to your own qualities, and it is due to Colonel Brandon's judgment.</t4703> <t4704>I have no merit in this matter.</t4704> <t4705>Until I understood his intentions, I did not know there was a vacant position, nor did I think he could bestow such a gift.</t4705> <t4706>As a friend of mine, of my family, perhaps he... in fact, I know he was very happy to offer it; but honestly, you owe nothing to my congratulations.</t4706>
<t4707>The truth forced her to silently acknowledge her partial involvement; but at the same time, she did not want to appear as Edward's benefactor, so she acknowledged it reluctantly, causing him to be somewhat suspicious.</t4707> <t4708>He sat thinking for a moment after Elinor had finished speaking, then finally, as if with some effort, he said:</t4708>
<t4709>- Colonel Brandon seems to be a person of high true value and worthy of respect.</t4709> <t4710>I have always heard people speak of him that way, and I know your brother holds him in high regard.</t4710> <t4711>Surely he is a sensitive person, and with the demeanor of a true gentleman.</t4711>
<t4712>Elinor replied:</t4712>
<t4713>- That's right.</t4713> <t4714>I believe that if you get to know him more, you will see that people are right about everything they say about him; and since you will be a close neighbor to him (as I understand the parsonage is quite near his house), it is important that he is just like everything people say.</t4714>
<t4715>A little while later, he stood up and said:</t4715>
<t4716>- As far as I know, Colonel Brandon resides on St. James Street.</t4716>
<t4717>Elinor told him the house number:</t4717>
<t4718>- Then I need to go quickly to thank him while you do not allow me to thank you; so that he believes he has made me a very... an extremely happy person.</t4718>
<t4719>Elinor did not want to keep him any longer.</t4719> <t4720>They parted ways, she with good wishes for his everlasting happiness in all changing circumstances; and he, only with more effort than eloquence to respond with the same goodwill.</t4720><t4721>.</t4721>
<t4722>When the door that saw him off had closed, Elinor silently said to herself: "When I see him again, I will be meeting Lucy's husband."</t4722>
<t4723>With this pleasant anticipation, she sat down to review the past, recall the words, and try to understand every thought of Edward; and, of course, reflect on her own thoughts with dissatisfaction.</t4723>
<t4724>When Mrs. Jennings returned, although she had met people she had never met before and had many things to say about them, the important secret still dominated her mind more than anything else, so as soon as she saw Elinor, she returned to the old topic.</t4724> <t4725>She exclaimed:</t4725>
<t4726>- Hey, my dear, I told the young man to go see you.</t4726> <t4727>Did I do the right thing?</t4727> <t4728>And I think you didn't have any trouble.</t4728> <t4729>You didn't see him hesitate to accept your proposal, did you?</t4729>
<t4730>- No, ma'am; this is unlikely to happen.</t4730>
<t4731>- Okay, and when will he be ready?</t4731> <t4732>Because it seems everything depends on this.</t4732>
<t4733>- Really?</t4733> <t4734>I know very little about this kind of procedure, so it's hard for me to estimate the time or the necessary preparations; but I think it will take two or three months to complete the ordination.</t4734>
<t4735>Mrs. Jennings exclaimed:</t4735>
<t4736>- Two or three months! Good heavens! You talk about it so calmly, and can the Colonel wait two or three months! God bless me! I don't think I have the patience!</t4736> <t4737>And though people will be very happy to be kind to poor Ferrars, I don't think it's worth waiting for him for two or three months.</t4737> <t4738>Surely anyone can be found to do this - someone who has already been ordained.</t4738>
<t4739>Elinor said:</t4739>
<t4740>- Dear madam, what are you thinking about? What, Colonel Brandon only intended to help Mr. Ferrars.</t4740>
<t4741>- God bless me, my dear! Surely you don't mean to persuade me that the Colonel married you just to pay Mr. Ferrars ten guineas!</t4741>
<t4742>The misunderstanding cannot continue after this statement.</t4742> <t4743>The explanation followed immediately, through which both felt quite amused for a moment without either losing their joy, as Mrs. Jennings simply shifted one source of joy to another without abandoning her wish for the first source.</t4743>
<t4744>After a brief moment of bubbling with surprise and satisfaction, she said:</t4744>
<t4745>- Yes, yes, the Parsonage is just a small house, and it may very well need repairs; but to hear a man apologize for a house I know has five reception rooms on the ground floor, and I heard the housekeeper say it could accommodate fifteen beds!</t4745> <t4746>And you, too, used to staying at Barton Cottage! It sounds quite funny.</t4746> <t4747>But, my dear niece, we must urge the Colonel to do something for the Parsonage before Lucy moves here.</t4747>
<t4748>- But Colonel Brandon seems to imply that the income is not sufficient for the two of them to get married.</t4748>
<t4749>- The Colonel is a naive person, my dear; because he has two thousand a year, he thinks no one can get married with a smaller income.</t4749> <t4750>Believe me, if I am still alive, I will visit the Parsonage at Delaford before Michaelmas; and I will not go if Lucy is not there.</t4750>
<t4751>Elinor somewhat agreed with her about the possibility that the couple might not need anything else.</t4751>
<t4752>Chapter 41</t4752>
<t4753>After thanking Colonel Brandon, Edward went to find Lucy at Barlett House with immense happiness.</t4753> <t4754>The next morning, Mrs. Jennings came to congratulate her and was told that she had never seen his spirits so high in his life.</t4754>
<t4755>S</t4755>
<t4756>At least her own happiness and her mental excitement were real, and she eagerly awaited, along with Mrs. Jennings, the comfortable life they would have at the Delaford Parsonage before Michaelmas.</t4756> <t4757>At the same time and belatedly, she did what Edward should have done, which was to praise Elinor, to the extent that she spoke of their friendship with the deepest gratitude, ready to reciprocate any favor for her friend, and publicly declared that no act of Miss Daswood in the present or future would surprise her, as she believed her friend capable of doing anything in the world for those she cherished.</t4757>
<t4758>As for Colonel Brandon, not only did she revere him like a saint, but she also earnestly wished to see him esteemed in all worldly matters; earnestly wished to see his church tithe 1 raised to the highest level; and desired to make use of, at Delaford, as much as possible: his servants, his carriage, his cattle, and his poultry.</t4758>
<t4759>It has now been more than a week since John Dashwood visited Berkeley Street.</t4759> <t4760>Since they had not received any further news about his wife's condition except through verbal inquiries, Elinor began to feel it necessary to visit them.</t4760> <t4761>However, this task not only went against her own inclinations but was also opposed by those around her.</t4761> <t4762>Not satisfied and adamantly refusing to accompany her, Marianne also urgently advised her sister not to go.</t4762> <t4763>Although Mrs. Jennings' carriage was always available for Elinor's use, she had such a strong aversion to Mrs. John Dashwood that her curiosity to know how she was doing, and her desire to oppose her by supporting Edward, still could not overcome her reluctance to face her.</t4763> <t4764>As a result, only Elinor went to visit her sister-in-law, risking an encounter with the woman whom the other two women had many reasons to despise.</t4764>
<t4765>Mrs. John Daswood could not receive guests; but before the carriage turned back, her husband happened to step out.</t4765> <t4766>He expressed his pleasure at seeing Elinor, told her that he intended to visit Berkeley Street and, reassuring her that Fanny would be very happy to see her, invited her into the house.</t4766>
<t4767>Two people walked up the stairs leading to the family room.</t4767> <t4768>"There is no one here."</t4768>
<t4769>He said:</t4769>
<t4770>- I guess Fanny is in her room.</t4770> <t4771>I'll go find her now, because I believe she won't mind meeting you - quite the opposite, really.</t4771> <t4772>Especially now, it's impossible... however, she has always been very fond of you and Marianne.</t4772> <t4773>Why didn't Marianne come?</t4773>
<t4774>Elinor tried to explain the reason.</t4774>
<t4775>He replied:</t4775>
<t4776>- I don't mind meeting you alone because I have many things I want to say to you.</t4776> <t4777>Is Colonel Brandon's clerical position... real?</t4777> <t4778>Did he truly offer that position to Edward? I happened to hear this news yesterday and was planning to come to you to ask more about it.</t4778>
<t4779>- It's true. Colonel Brandon has given the clerical position to Edward.</t4779>
<t4780>- Ah, I see! So, that's really surprising! - No familial relation! - No connection between the two! - And now, clerical positions are really worth a lot! How much is this position worth?</t4780>
<t4781>- About two hundred and one years.</t4781>
<t4782>- Very well.</t4782> <t4783>And to appoint the next person at that value... suppose the current holder is old and sickly, and may soon resign... you guess he might accept... one thousand four hundred pounds.</t4783> <t4784>And why doesn't he arrange it before the current holder passes away?</t4784> <t4785>Now it is truly too late to sell this position, but a person with the awareness of Colonel Brandon! You wonder why he didn't think ahead in such a common, natural matter! But then, you believe there are many inconsistencies in every human character.</t4785> <t4786>However, you guess - upon reflection - that the case might be like this.</t4786> <t4787>Edward only holds the position until the person to whom the Colonel truly sold the position is old enough to take over.</t4787> <t4788>Yes, yes, that is indeed the truth.</t4788>
<t4789>However, Elinor determined very firmly that it was not so.</t4789> <t4790>She compelled him to accept her word by recounting how Colonel Brandon had asked her to convey his offer to Edward, and therefore she had to be well aware of the conditions.</t4790>
<t4791>He exclaimed after hearing her speak:</t4791>
<t4792>- It's truly surprising! What could be the Colonel's motivation?</t4792>
<t4793>- Very simple - to help Mr. Ferrars.</t4793>
<t4794>- Alright, alright; no matter what Colonel Brandon is like, Edward is a very lucky man.</t4794> <t4795>However, please do not mention this to Fanny; because even though he has informed her and she is handling it quite well, she does not want to hear people talk much about this matter.</t4795>
<t4796>Here, Elinor had to try very hard to restrain herself from commenting that she thought Fanny would calmly endure her brother receiving the inheritance as long as she or her child could not be impoverished.</t4796>
<t4797>Lowering his voice to indicate something very important, he continued:</t4797>
<t4798>- Mrs. Ferrars doesn't know anything about this yet, and you believe it's best to keep it from her as long as possible.</t4798> <t4799>When they hold the wedding, you fear she will hear everything.</t4799>
<t4800>- But why be so careful? Although it should not be assumed that Mrs. Ferrars would be pleased to know that her son has enough money to live on, even though this is unlikely; but based on her recent attitude, why assume she has any feelings?</t4800> <t4801>She has finished with her son, has completely disowned him, and has caused those influenced by her to do the same.</t4801> <t4802>Surely, after doing so, it should not be thought that she would feel sorrow or joy about his affairs - it is impossible that she would care about anything that happens to him.</t4802> <t4803>She is not so weak as to discard the comfort of a child, but still restrain the worries of a mother!</t4803>
<t4804>John said:</t4804>
<t4805>- Ah! Elinor, your reasoning is very good, but only because you do not understand the nature of people.</t4805> <t4806>When Edward's unfortunate wedding takes place, believe that his mother-in-law will feel as if she has never felt from him; and therefore it is necessary to hide from her as long as possible any situation that could hasten this event.</t4806> <t4807>Mrs. Ferrars will never forget that Edward is her son.</t4807>
<t4808>- You surprised me; I thought this had already faded from her memory by now.</t4808>
<t4809>- You misunderstood her a lot.</t4809> <t4810>Mrs. Ferrars is one of the most loving mothers in the world.</t4810>
<t4811>Elinor was silent.</t4811>
<t4812>After a moment, Mr. Daswood continued:</t4812>
<t4813>- Now the family is thinking about Robert marrying Miss Morton.</t4813>
<t4814>Smiling at the importance and decisiveness in his voice, Elinor calmly replied:</t4814>
<t4815>- I think, she doesn't have the right to choose in this matter.</t4815>
<t4816>- Choose! What do you mean?</t4816>
<t4817>- I only meant that, according to the way you said it, Miss Morton is the same person whether she marries Edward or Robert.</t4817>
<t4818>- That's right, there can't be any difference; because now Robert is practically considered the eldest son; and in every other respect, both brothers are pleasant young men.</t4818> <t4819>He doesn't see one as better than the other.</t4819>
<t4820>Elinor did not say anything more, and John was also silent for a moment.</t4820> <t4821>Then his thoughts ceased, he affectionately took his half-sister's hand, whispering:</t4821>
<t4822>- Dear sister, there is something I want to reassure you about, and I will reassure you, because I know it will make you happy.</t4822> <t4823>I have a reason to think... actually, I heard it from the most knowledgeable person, otherwise I wouldn't repeat it because it would be a big mistake to say such a thing... but I heard it from the most knowledgeable person... it wasn't exactly from Mrs. Ferrars, but her daughter said it, and I heard it from her...</t4823> <t4824>that, in summary, regardless of any objections about someone... a certain relative - you surely understand me - she still thought it would have been much better, possibly only causing her half the distress compared to this matter.</t4824>
<t4825>"I am very glad to hear that Mrs. Ferrars has been thinking in this direction - a situation that we all very much appreciate, you must know.</t4825> <t4826>She said: 'It cannot be compared, less bad of the two bad things, and she would be pleased to compromise now because nothing could be worse.'</t4826> <t4827>But, it all cannot be... should not be thought of or mentioned...</t4827> <t4828>you know, about matters of the heart... it can never be - it is all over."</t4828>
<t4829>"But I think I will tell you this, because I know you will be very happy.</t4829> <t4830>Dear Elinor, that is not a reason to regret.</t4830> <t4831>There is no doubt that you have behaved very well, as well as - perhaps better than - in all matters.</t4831> <t4832>Have you met Colonel Brandon recently?"</t4832>
<t4833>Elinor had heard enough to be disturbed and her mind filled, if not enough to satisfy vanity and self-importance.</t4833> <t4834>Therefore, she was glad to see Robert Ferrars enter, so she would not have to answer much and would not have to hear anything more from his brother.</t4834> <t4835>After a moment of conversation, suddenly remembering that Fanny had not been informed she was there, John Dashwood left the room to find his wife.</t4835> <t4836>Elinor was left to sit and improve her acquaintance with Robert.</t4836> <t4837>He had confirmed her worst opinions of his mind and heart through his cheerful indifference, self-satisfaction in happiness, to unjustly enjoy the affection and generosity of his mother, gained through a profligate lifestyle that harmed his brother.</t4837>
<t4838>After just two minutes of conversation, he began to talk about Edward; for he had also heard about the clerical position, and felt very curious about the matter.</t4838> <t4839>Elinor repeated the details as she had told John.</t4839> <t4840>Robert's reaction, although quite different, was no less remarkable than the other man's.</t4840> <t4841>He laughed somewhat excessively.</t4841> <t4842>The idea of Edward becoming a clergyman and living in a small parsonage made him laugh heartily; and when he added the imagined image of Edward preaching in a white robe and officiating a wedding between some John Smith and some Mary Brown, he just found it absurd.</t4842>
<t4843>While remaining silent and sternly motionless to await the conclusion of such mad words, Elinor could not restrain her eyes from fixing on him with a gaze that conveyed all her contempt.</t4843> <t4844>However, the gaze was reasonably bestowed, as it helped her release all her feelings without revealing anything to him.</t4844> <t4845>From jesting, he turned to wisdom not because she reproached him, but through his own perception.</t4845>
<t4846>Finally, he stopped the laughter that had prolonged the excitement, and said:</t4846>
<t4847>- We can consider this a joke, but deep down, to me, this is a serious matter.</t4847> <t4848>Poor Edward! He has been ruined for life.</t4848> <t4849>I feel very sorry for him because I know he has a very good nature; probably as well-intentioned as anyone in the world.</t4849> <t4850>Miss Dashwood, you should not judge him based on your brief acquaintance.</t4850> <t4851>Poor Edward! His behavior certainly does not lead to the best happiness according to common sense.</t4851> <t4852>But you see, we are not all born with the same talents, the same qualities.</t4852>
<t4853>"Poor guy!</t4853> <t4854>Seeing him among a crowd of strangers!</t4854> <t4855>It truly is pitiful!</t4855> <t4856>But deep down, I believe he has a heart as good as anyone in this kingdom; and I assure you my aunt has never been so shocked in her life, when the incident broke out.</t4856> <t4857>I can't believe it."</t4857>
<t4858>"My mother was the first to tell me about this; and I, feeling the need to act decisively, immediately said to her: 'Dear mother, I am not sure what you intend to do about this, but as for me, I must say, if Edward has to marry this girl, I will never see him again.'</t4858> <t4859>I said it right away.</t4859> <t4860>I was truly shocked in the most extraordinary way!</t4860> <t4861>Poor Edward! - he brought it all upon himself - excluding himself from respectable associations!</t4861> <t4862>But as I immediately told my mother, I was not surprised at all; given his upbringing, this was bound to happen.</t4862> <t4863>My poor mother was almost driven mad."</t4863>
<t4864>- Have you ever met her?</t4864>
<t4865>- Yes; once, when she stayed at this house, I happened to drop by for ten minutes; and I learned enough about her.</t4865> <t4866>A clumsy country girl with nothing worth noting, lacking grace or elegance, hardly beautiful.</t4866> <t4867>I remember her very clearly.</t4867> <t4868>The kind of girl that I guess could only attract poor Edward.</t4868>
<t4869>"As soon as my mother told me about the incident, I immediately volunteered to talk to him, advising him to give her up; but I found that it was too late to do anything, because unfortunately, at the beginning, I was not involved in this matter and knew nothing about it until it blew up, when, you know, I had no right to intervene.</t4869> <t4870>But if I had been informed a few hours earlier, I think I might have found some solution.</t4870> <t4871>Surely I could have presented this solution to Edward with very solid arguments.</t4871> <t4872>I could have said: 'My dear, think about what you are doing.</t4872> <t4873>You are in the most disgraceful relationship, and it is one that the whole family unanimously opposes'."</t4873>
<t4874>"In short, I cannot escape the thought that I might find a solution.</t4874> <t4875>But now it is all too late.</t4875> <t4876>He must be hungry, you know; certainly: hungry and tattered."</t4876>
<t4877>Just as he concluded his point with extreme calmness, Mrs. John Daswood entered and ended the conversation.</t4877> <t4878>But although she never spoke about the matter with anyone outside her family, Elinor could see the impact on her sister-in-law's mind, in a certain confused expression on her face, in her forced attempt to appear friendly towards her.</t4878> <t4879>Her sister-in-law even went so far as to express regret upon learning that Elinor and her sister would soon be leaving the city, and hoped to see them again.</t4879> <t4880>Her husband seemed to recognize all the affection and grace in his wife's efforts.</t4880>
<t4881>Chapter 42</t4881>
<t4882>Another short visit to Harley Street ended the cordial relationship between the brother and his two sisters in the city, after the brother expressed his joy that the two sisters, Elinor and Marianne, could travel part of the way to Barton without expense, and that one or two days later Colonel Brandon would follow them to Cleveland. Fanny superficially invited the two sisters to stop by Norland whenever they had the chance - something unlikely to happen; while John promised Elinor - more warmly but more privately - that he would be ready to visit her at Delaford. That was all that was promised for future meetings in the countryside.</t4882>
<t4883>T</t4883>
<t4884>Elinor amusingly observed that all her acquaintances seemed intent on sending her to Delaford, a place which, compared to everywhere else, she had the least desire to visit or reside in.</t4884> <t4885>Not only did her brother and Mrs. Jennings consider it her future family home, but even Lucy, upon parting, earnestly invited her to visit there.</t4885>
<t4886>At the beginning of April and at quite an early hour of the day, two groups set out from Hanover Square 1 and Berkeley Street to a meeting point along the way.</t4886> <t4887>To ensure the comfort of Mrs. Charlotte and her daughter, they would depart two days earlier; while Mr. Palmer, traveling faster with Colonel Brandon, would meet them at Cleveland shortly after their arrival.</t4887>
<t4888>Having had little time to relax in London and long eager to leave the city, Marianne said her farewell, in utmost pain, to the house where she had last harbored hope, and where her love for Willoughby had completely faded.</t4888> <t4889>With tears streaming down her face, she left the place where Willoughby remained, busy with new interactions and new plans, in which she could not partake.</t4889>
<t4890>Elinor was more satisfied.</t4890> <t4891>She had no such object to dwell on, she was not parting from anyone who had given her regret in the moment of separation, and she was glad to be free from the torment of friendship with Lucy. She was also relieved to bring her sister back without her having seen Willoughby since his marriage, and she looked forward to a few quiet months at Barton to help restore peace to Marianne's mind and to confirm peace in her own.</t4891>
<t4892>The trip was peaceful.</t4892> <t4893>The second day brought them to a county in Somerset that many people loved but Marianne's imagination forbade, and on the afternoon of the third day, they arrived at Cleveland.</t4893>
<t4894>Cleveland is a spacious residence, built in a modern style, located on a sloping lawn.</t4894> <t4895>There is no flower garden, but the landscape of the playgrounds is quite rich. Like every other estate of similar importance, there are also shrubbery patches, forest walkways, a gravel path winding around the estate leading to the front, scattered trees on the lawn, fir trees, wild rose bushes, and acacia trees shielding the house, and a strip full of these trees, interspersed with birches, separating the workrooms.</t4895>
<t4896>Marianne stepped into the house with emotions overflowing at the thought that she was only eighty miles from Barton, and less than thirty miles from Combe Magna.</t4896> <t4897>Only five minutes later, while the others were busy helping Charlotte introduce the baby to the servants, she slipped outside through the winding groves, beginning a beautiful scene to reach a distant mound.</t4897> <t4898>From a Greek-style house there, she gazed over a vast rural expanse to the southeast, lovingly focusing on the farthest peaks of the hills on the horizon, imagining she could see Combe Magna from these hilltops.</t4898>
<t4899>In those precious moments of melancholy, she rejoiced in the sorrowful tears of going to Cleveland. When she returned to the house by a different route, feeling all the privileged happiness of a leisurely life in the countryside, wandering here and there in the serene and abundant freedom, she decided that during her stay with the Palmer family, she would spend every hour of every day immersing herself in such solitary wanderings.</t4899>
<t4900>She returned just in time to accompany the others on an excursion to the surrounding areas.</t4900> <t4901>The rest of the morning passed pleasantly by wandering in the vegetable garden, admiring the clusters of flowers on the garden wall, and listening to the gardener lament about plant diseases, lingering in the greenhouse where Charlotte laughed because the flowers she liked were exposed to frost and withered, visiting the poultry house where the owner took additional pleasure in seeing the dairy maid disappointed about the hens abandoning their nests or being taken by foxes, or about the decline of promising young chicks.</t4901>
<t4902>The morning sky was clear and dry.</t4902> <t4903>In her outdoor activity plan, Marianne did not account for the change in weather.</t4903> <t4904>Therefore, she was very surprised to see a rainstorm preventing her from going outside after dinner.</t4904> <t4905>She had intended to take a walk in the twilight to the Greek church, perhaps wandering across the fields, undeterred by the chill or dampness.</t4905> <t4906>But with a heavy and persistent rain, even she could not imagine it was good weather for a stroll.</t4906>
<t4907>The number of guests staying over was few, and time passed peacefully.</t4907> <t4908>Miss Palmer was busy with the child; Mrs. Jennings with her knitting.</t4908> <t4909>They talked about the friends who were still around, arranged Lady Middleton's schedule, and wondered if Mr. Palmer and Colonel Brandon had arrived in Reading tonight.</t4909> <t4910>Though not very interested in the matter, Elinor still joined the conversation.</t4910> <t4911>By skillfully finding her way through every building to the reading room despite the family's indifference to books, Marianne soon found a book to read.</t4911>
<t4912>Mrs. Palmer was not lacking in friendly playfulness to entertain her guests.</t4912> <t4913>Her open and warm attitude more than compensated for her lack of thought and elegance, which often made her less courteous; her kindness combined with her very pretty face was truly captivating; her foolishness, though apparent, was not hateful because it was not deceitful.</t4913> <t4914>Elinor could overlook everything except her laughter.</t4914>
<t4915>The next day, two men arrived and joined a very late dinner, expanding the group in a cheerful atmosphere and bringing more topics to the conversation, which had dried up after the persistent rain that lasted all morning.</t4915>
<t4916>Elinor had observed very little in Mr. Palmer, and from that little, she had seen his attitude constantly changing towards her sister and herself, to the point where she did not know what kind of person he was within his family.</t4916> <t4917>However, she found him to be a genuinely noble person in his dealings with all the guests, and only occasionally rude to his wife and mother-in-law.</t4917> <t4918>She also saw that he had the potential to become a pleasant friend, but could not always be pleasant because he had the flaw of being too conceited, imagining himself superior to others, especially to Mrs. Jennings and Charlotte.</t4918> <t4919>Regarding the remaining aspects of his personality and habits, Elinor found nothing unusual for his gender and age.</t4919> <t4920>He was delicate in his eating habits, erratic with his schedule; loved his child though not very affectionately; and wasted his mornings at the billiard table instead of attending to business.</t4920>
<t4921>However, in general, Elinor liked him more than she initially thought, and deep down she did not regret that she couldn't like him more; she did not regret seeing his gourmet taste, selfishness, and arrogance, which allowed her to be satisfied when recalling Edward's generous demeanor, simple pleasures, and humble thoughts.</t4921>
<t4922>Regarding Edward, or at least some of his concerns, Elinor now learned through Colonel Brandon, as he had recently visited Dorsetshire.</t4922> <t4923>Having seen her as an unselfish friend of Mr. Ferrars and a confidante of his own, he spoke to her extensively about the Delaford Parsonage, describing its deficiencies and informing her of his plans for its improvement.</t4923> <t4924>His demeanor towards her during these conversations, as well as other details, his cheerful nature revealed to her after only ten days of separation, his willingness to converse with her, and his respect for her opinions - all of these convinced Mrs. Jennings that he was in love with her.</t4924>
<t4925>Perhaps that would have been enough to make Elinor doubt herself, if she had not believed from the start that Marianne was the one he loved.</t4925> <t4926>But in truth, that thought never crossed her mind until Mrs. Jennings made her comment.</t4926> <t4927>However, she still believed that between the two of them, she was the better observer: she watched his eyes while Mrs. Jennings only considered his gestures.</t4927> <t4928>His eyes, when he was worried about Marianne's spirit and health, escaped Mrs. Jennings' notice because they could not be expressed in words.</t4928> <t4929>As for her, she could see in those eyes the subtle emotions and unnecessary panic of a person in love.</t4929>
<t4930>On the third and fourth days after Marianne arrived, she had two twilight walks not only on the gravel path but across the entire field, especially in the areas farthest away where the trees were tallest, the grass was thickest, and the ground was wettest.</t4930> <t4931>This way of walking, combined with carelessness when her shoes and socks got wet, caused her to catch a cold which she initially ignored or denied for the first couple of days, only for it to worsen, causing everyone concern.</t4931> <t4932>Medicines came from everywhere, but as usual, they were all refused.</t4932> <t4933>She believed that despite the severity and the fever, along with aching limbs, a cough, and a sore throat, a single night's rest would completely cure her.</t4933> <t4934>Elinor had a hard time persuading her sister to take even one or two of the simplest medicines.</t4934>
<t4935>Chapter 43</t4935>
<t4936>Marianne woke up the next morning at the same time as usual, and to every inquiry she replied that she was better, trying to prove it by continuing with her daily activities.</t4936> <t4937>But a day spent trembling by the fireplace with a book in hand that she could not read, or lying on the armchair feeling tired and listless, did not show much improvement.</t4937> <t4938>Finally, when she went to bed early, she grew weaker and weaker.</t4938> <t4939>Colonel Brandon was only surprised by the calm demeanor of her sister; for Elinor had been attending and caring for her sister all day, contrary to her sister's wishes, forcing her to take medicine in the evening, like Marianne, hoping that sleep would help her recover, and did not feel genuinely worried.</t4939>
<t4940>M</t4940>
<t4941>However, a restless and feverish night left both of them disappointed.</t4941> <t4942>When Marianne resolutely wanted to get up, then admitted she couldn't sit up and voluntarily lay back down on the bed, Elinor was ready to follow Mrs. Jennings' advice and called the Palmer family's apothecary.</t4942>
<t4943>The man arrived, examined the patient, and reassured Elinor, making her believe that her sister would recover in just a few days.</t4943> <t4944>However, when he mentioned that her sister's condition had a tendency to cause fever and allowed the word "infection" to slip from his lips, he immediately alarmed Mrs. Palmer, who began to worry about her child.</t4944> <t4945>From the beginning, Mrs. Jennings had taken Marianne's illness more seriously than Elinor, and now, showing great concern based on Mr. Harris's report, she agreed with Charlotte's fears and caution, advising the mother and daughter to leave immediately.</t4945> <t4946>Despite downplaying the worries, Mr. Palmer found himself unable to resist his wife's anxiety and insistence.</t4946> <t4947>Thus, they decided that she should leave.</t4947> <t4948>Within an hour of Mr. Harris's arrival, she took the baby and the nurse to a nearby relative of Mr. Palmer's, a few miles away on the other side of Bath. Following his wife's earnest request, the husband promised to join them in a day or two.</t4948>
<t4949>However, through genuine kindness from the bottom of her heart, which made Elinor truly fond of her, Mrs. Jennings declared that she would not budge from Cleveland as long as Marianne was still weak, and endeavored to take the place of her mother through her attentive care.</t4949> <t4950>Elinor always saw in her a diligent and energetic helper, eager to share all her burdens, and often helped her greatly with her experience in caring for the sick.</t4950>
<t4951>Poor Marianne, exhausted and mentally devastated by the illness and overall weakness, no longer held hope that she would feel better the next day.</t4951> <t4952>The very thought of what the next day would bring only worsened her condition, because if not for the illness, they would have started their journey back home that day; and escorted by one of Mrs. Jennings' servants, the two sisters would have surprised their mother the following morning.</t4952> <t4953>The little she could say were complaints about this delay; even though Elinor tried to lift her sister's spirits and persuade her to believe, as she herself truly believed at that time, that it was only a short delay.</t4953>
<t4954>The next day did not show that the patient had made good progress; she certainly was not better, but did not seem worse either.</t4954> <t4955>The group of people now dwindled further; for Mr. Palmer, persuaded by Colonel Brandon, finally kept his promise to his wife, though he was reluctant to leave partly out of humanitarian and kind reasons, and partly because he did not want to appear afraid of his wife.</t4955> <t4956>While he was preparing, Colonel Brandon, through greater effort, also expressed a desire to leave.</t4956> <t4957>However, here Mrs. Jennings' kindness intervened and was most appreciated; for she thought that the Colonel leaving while his beloved was distressed by her sister's illness would leave both of them despondent, so she immediately told him that it was necessary for him to stay at Cleveland, that she needed him to play cards in the evening while Miss Dashwood was caring for her sister upstairs, and so on.</t4957> <t4958>She was so earnest that he agreed to fulfill the first wish of his heart, and thereafter did not want to appear hesitant; especially since Mr. Palmer enthusiastically supported Mrs. Jennings, as he felt relieved to leave behind someone so capable to assist or advise Miss Dashwood in any emergency situation.</t4958>
<t4959>Of course, Marianne had no knowledge of these arrangements.</t4959> <t4960>She did not know that she was the reason for driving the owners of Cleveland away, about seven days after they arrived here.</t4960> <t4961>She was not surprised when she did not see anything belonging to Mrs. Palmer; and since this did not concern her, she never mentioned the host's name.</t4961>
<t4962>Two days after Mr. Palmer left, Marianne's condition remained almost unchanged.</t4962> <t4963>Mr. Harris came to care for her every day, still bravely speaking of a quick recovery, and Mrs. Dashwood was equally optimistic; but the others were not as encouraged.</t4963> <t4964>At first, Mrs. Jennings had determined that Marianne was unlikely to survive.</t4964> <t4965>Colonel Brandon always listened and could not resist the influence of her premonitions.</t4965> <t4966>He tried to reason from the fear that the apothecary seemed to find unreasonable; but many hours each day passed with him left entirely alone, making it easier for him to accept gloomy thoughts, and he could not rid his mind of the idea that he might never see her again.</t4966>
<t4967>However, on the morning of the third day, the pessimistic predictions proved to be incorrect, because when Mr. Harris arrived, he informed that the patient had significantly improved.</t4967> <t4968>Her pulse was much stronger; all symptoms were better than during the previous visit.</t4968> <t4969>Elinor was very encouraged after her hopes were confirmed, happily thinking back that in the letters to her mother, she had presented her own judgment instead of her friend's, to ease the news of their late return, and now she could almost determine the time when Marianne would be strong enough to travel.</t4969>
<t4970>But this day ended not as promisingly as it began.</t4970> <t4971>In the evening, Marianne's illness worsened again, becoming more severe, restless, and uncomfortable than before.</t4971> <t4972>Nevertheless, her sister remained optimistic, believing that Marianne was merely fatigued from having to sit up while the servants made the bed, carefully giving her a heart tonic, and feeling satisfied to see her sister drift into a sleep that she thought would yield good results.</t4972> <t4973>Marianne slept quite a bit, though not as soundly as Elinor had hoped.</t4973> <t4974>Anxious to see the outcome of her sister's sleep for herself, Elinor stayed by her side.</t4974> <t4975>Mrs. Jennings went to bed earlier than usual, unaware of the patient's condition; the maid, one of the main caregivers, was relaxing in the housekeeper's room, leaving Elinor alone with Marianne.</t4975>
<t4976>Her sister became increasingly agitated.</t4976> <t4977>Her older sister continuously observed all developments, listening to the intermittent moans from her younger sister's lips, just as she was about to wake her from a restless sleep, when suddenly Marianne was jolted awake by a noise in the house, sitting up with a frantic cry in her feverish state:</t4977>
<t4978>- Is Mom coming?</t4978>
<t4979>Elinor concealed her horror, helping her sister lie down:</t4979>
<t4980>- Not yet, but she hopes that mom will come here soon.</t4980> <t4981>The road from Barton to here is long, you know.</t4981>
<t4982>Marianne exclaimed in the same hurried tone:</t4982>
<t4983>- But you shouldn't go through London.</t4983> <t4984>I won't be able to see you anymore if you go to London.</t4984>
<t4985>Elinor was horrified to realize that her sister was no longer conscious, and she checked her pulse while trying to comfort her.</t4985> <t4986>The pulse was weaker and faster than ever; while Marianne continued to rave madly about their mother, her sister became even more alarmed, deciding to urgently summon Mr. Harris and send a message to their mother in Barton.</t4986> <t4987>Immediately, she wanted to consult Colonel Brandon about the best way to handle the latter, and after calling the maid to take her place beside her sister, she hurried to the family room, knowing he often sat there until late.</t4987>
<t4988>There is no time to hesitate.</t4988> <t4989>Her fears and difficulties immediately confronted him.</t4989> <t4990>Her fears, he did not have the courage or confidence to reassure; he listened in silence, feeling despondent.</t4990> <t4991>But her difficulties were immediately resolved, because with a zeal appropriate to the situation and the actions he had already planned in his mind, he volunteered to be the messenger for Mrs. Daswood. Elinor found it hard to refuse.</t4991> <t4992>She thanked him briefly but warmly, and while he sent his servant to urgently call Mr. Harris and hire two post horses, she wrote a few lines to her mother.</t4992>
<t4993>The idea of having a friend like Colonel Brandon at such a time - having such a companion for her mother, how cherished it felt! - a companion with the discernment to guide, the presence to support, and the friendship to console her! If anything could help mitigate the shock for her when asking to call her mother, it was his presence, his gestures, his supportive spirit.</t4993>
<t4994>During that time, regardless of what he might think, he acted with the firmness of a focused mind, arranging everything swiftly, calculating precisely the time she could wait for his return.</t4994> <t4995>Not a moment was wasted.</t4995> <t4996>The horses had arrived earlier than expected, and Colonel Brandon only grasped her hand with solemn eyes, adding a few words too soft for her to hear clearly, then hurriedly went to the carriage.</t4996> <t4997>It was now midnight, and she returned to her sister's room to wait for the apothecary to arrive, and stayed by her sister's side all night.</t4997>
<t4998>This is the night when both sisters suffered equally.</t4998> <t4999>Each hour passed in sleepless pain and delirium for Marianne, in the cruelest anxiety for Elinor, before Mr. Harris appeared.</t4999> <t5000>Her anxiety, once aroused, was further aggravated by her previous sense of security, compounded by the maid sitting with her, as Elinor did not allow calling Mrs. Jennings, all of which only tortured her more through the implications that the mistress always thought of.</t5000>
<t5001>Marianne's thoughts occasionally wandered disjointedly around her mother, and every time her sister mentioned her name, it caused Elinor's poor heart to ache.</t5001> <t5002>The elder sister blamed herself for having disregarded her sister's illness for many days, now miserably awaiting an urgent remedy, imagining that every solution had been delayed for too long, thinking of the scene where the sorrowful mother arrived too late to see her beloved daughter's face, or unable to see the reason in her.</t5002>
<t5003>When she was about to send someone to call Mr. Harris again, or if he couldn't come, to call someone else, he arrived - but they had to wait until five in the morning.</t5003> <t5004>However, his opinion did not make up for the delay, because although he acknowledged that the patient's condition had unexpectedly changed for the worse, he still believed there was nothing dangerous, and spoke about the effectiveness that the new treatment plan would bring, with a confidence that somewhat influenced Elinor.</t5004> <t5005>He promised to return within three or four hours, then left with both the patient and the caregiver feeling more reassured than before he came.</t5005>
<t5006>The next morning, Mrs. Jennings heard about what had happened during the night with extreme concern, and with reproach for not having called her.</t5006> <t5007>Her previous worries, now reinforced by more solid reasoning, left her in no doubt about the outcome; and although she tried to comfort Elinor, and she believed her sister was in danger, she could not find comfort in hope.</t5007> <t5008>Her heart was truly in anguish.</t5008> <t5009>The rapid decline, the death of such a young girl, a beautiful girl like Marianne, must have struck deeply into the mind of even someone less concerned.</t5009>
<t5010>For Mrs. Jennings, it was even more so.</t5010> <t5011>She had been her companion for three months, was still under her guardianship, and had suffered severe emotional distress, grieving for a long time.</t5011> <t5012>Present before her was also the sorrow of her sister, whom she particularly cherished; - and regarding the mother of the two girls, when Mrs. Jennings considered what Marianne meant to her friend as Charlotte meant to her, her sympathy for the younger sister's suffering was very genuine.</t5012>
<t5013>Mr. Harris arrived on time the next time; - but he came to be disappointed with the recent treatment plan.</t5013> <t5014>His medication had not been effective; - the fever had not subsided; and Marianne was only more silent - no longer herself - still in a heavy stupor.</t5014> <t5015>Elinor had grasped everything, and more than everything, his fear in that moment, and suggested calling someone else.</t5015> <t5016>But he deemed it unnecessary; he still had another method to try, which he was as confident in as the previous one that it would succeed.</t5016> <t5017>His visit ended with reassurances that only reached her ears, but could not touch the heart of Miss Dashwood. She was calm, except when she thought of her mother; but she was nearly hopeless.</t5017>
<t5018>She remained in that state until noon, hardly moving from her sister's bed.</t5018> <t5019>Her thoughts wandered from one image of sorrow, one suffering friend to another.</t5019> <t5020>Her spirit was utterly crushed by Mrs. Jennings' conversation, as she did not hesitate to assume that this dangerous illness was the result of the despair Marianne had endured weeks before.</t5020> <t5021>Elinor found all of Mrs. Jennings' reasoning plausible, and this added further distress to her thoughts.</t5021>
<t5022>However, around noon she began - but with caution, terrified of the disappointment that had kept her silent for a while, even towards her - she imagined, hoped to recognize a slight recovery in her sister's pulse.</t5022> <t5023>She waited, watched, and then checked her sister's pulse again.</t5023> <t5024>Finally, through the barely concealed fluctuations beneath her calm exterior, she expressed her hope.</t5024> <t5025>Mrs. Jennings also examined, and though forced to acknowledge a temporary recovery, still tried to advise the young girl not to indulge in the thought that the recovery would continue.</t5025> <t5026>Reflecting on all of Mrs. Jennings' directives to be suspicious, Elinor also told herself not to hope.</t5026> <t5027>But it was too late.</t5027> <t5028>Hope had already crept into her mind; and feeling every anxious tremor, she bent over her sister to observe - she didn't know what she was supposed to observe.</t5028>
<t5029>Another half hour passed, and the positive symptoms now made her happy.</t5029> <t5030>Others came to confirm.</t5030> <t5031>The signs of recovery through her sister's breathing, skin color, and lips all made Elinor happy.</t5031> <t5032>Then Marianne stared at her intently, alert though still tired.</t5032> <t5033>Anxiety and hope now weighed equally, not giving her a moment's peace until Mr. Harris returned at four o'clock.</t5033> <t5034>His reassurances, his congratulations on her sister's recovery exceeding his expectations, all gave her confidence, peace of mind, and tears of joy.</t5034>
<t5035>In every aspect, Marianne was significantly better, and he stated that she had completely recovered from the danger.</t5035> <t5036>Perhaps satisfied that her predictions during the recent panic were only partially correct, Mrs. Jennings now allowed herself to trust his judgment; and through genuine joy leading to outright happiness, she acknowledged that the patient had the potential for a full recovery.</t5036>
<t5037>Elinor could not feel joyful.</t5037> <t5038>Her happiness was of a different kind, leading to something other than elation.</t5038> <t5039>Marianne had been restored to life, health, friends, and a doting mother; this idea filled her heart with profound comfort and spread a warm sense of gratitude, but it did not lead to outward expressions of joy, no words, no smiles.</t5039> <t5040>All within Elinor's mind was silent and strong contentment.</t5040>
<t5041>She continued to stay by her sister's side with little interruption throughout the afternoon, reassuring her sister's every fear, satisfying her every question about her own frail spirit, helping her with everything, observing her every glance and every breath.</t5041> <t5042>In a few moments, the possibility of a relapse naturally occurred to remind her of what worry was like; but through frequent and careful observation, she saw that all the symptoms of recovery were progressing.</t5042> <t5043>At six o'clock, she saw Marianne fall into a quiet, peaceful sleep, and by all indications, comfortable, so she extinguished all doubts.</t5043>
<t5044>The time dragged on until they could look forward to Colonel Brandon's return.</t5044> <t5045>She believed that by ten o'clock, or at least not much later, her mother would be relieved from the terrible anxiety she carried on her way to her two daughters.</t5045> <t5046>The Colonel too! Perhaps he was an equally pitiable subject!</t5046> <t5047>Oh! How slowly time passed, leaving them still unaware of the outcome!</t5047>
<t5048>At seven o'clock, leaving Marianne still sound asleep, she went down to have tea with Mrs. Jennings in the family room.</t5048> <t5049>At breakfast she had been overwhelmed by tears, and at dinner she had been preoccupied with the critical illness, so she had no appetite at all.</t5049> <t5050>Therefore, with a sense of calm she tried to bring, the tea and snacks were now received with special appreciation.</t5050> <t5051>When finished, Mrs. Jennings persuaded her to rest before her mother arrived, and offered to take her place beside Marianne; but Elinor did not feel tired, could not sleep at this time while thinking of her mother, and did not want to leave her sister for a single unnecessary moment.</t5051> <t5052>So Mrs. Jennings led her up the stairs to the sickroom, to ensure everything continued to be in order, then left her with the patient and her own thoughts, and returned to her room to write letters and then go to bed.</t5052>
<t5053>The night passed in cold and storm.</t5053> <t5054>The wind howled around the house and the rain beat against the doors; but Elinor inside was completely happy, paying no attention to it.</t5054> <t5055>Marianne slept soundly through each gust of wind; and the two people on the road had a precious reward waiting for them, to compensate for their current hardships.</t5055>
<t5056>The clock struck eight.</t5056> <t5057>If it had been ten, Elinor would have believed that at this moment she heard the sound of a carriage approaching the house; and she believed so strongly that she actually heard it, although it was almost impossible that the two had arrived, to the point that she went through the adjoining dressing room, opened the window to be satisfied with the truth.</t5057> <t5058>She immediately saw that her ears had not deceived her.</t5058> <t5059>The lights of a carriage instantly came into her view.</t5059> <t5060>Through the flickering light, she thought she could make out that it was a four-horse carriage; and this explained the early arrival, though it showed that the poor mother had been overly anxious and hired an expensive type of carriage.</t5060>
<t5061>Never in her life had Elinor found it so difficult to remain calm as in this moment.</t5061> <t5062>The thought of how her mother must be feeling as the carriage stopped at the door, - or her suspicions - or her state of terror - perhaps her despair! - and what she herself would say! - it was hard to stay composed amidst such chaotic thoughts.</t5062> <t5063>Everything else that needed to be done was urgent; and so, only waiting for Mrs. Jennings' servant to take her place beside her sister, she hurried down the stairs.</t5063>
<t5064>As she walked along the inner hallway, the commotion in the foyer told her that two people had entered the house.</t5064> <t5065>She hurried to the family room - she stepped in - and saw only Willoughby.</t5065>
<t5066>Chapter 44</t5066>
<t5067>Starting to retreat with a horrified look upon seeing him, Elinor followed the first impulse of her heart by immediately stepping out of the room.</t5067> <t5068>Her hand had just touched the door latch when she paused, for he had hurriedly approached, his voice sounding more like a command than a plea:</t5068>
<t5069>B</t5069>
<t5070>- Miss Daswood, just half an hour - just ten minutes - I beg you to stay.</t5070>
<t5071>She firmly replied:</t5071>
<t5072>- No, sir, I will not stay.</t5072> <t5073>You cannot have any business with me.</t5073> <t5074>I guess the servant forgot to tell you that Mr. Palmer is away.</t5074>
<t5075>He exclaimed impatiently:</t5075>
<t5076>- Even if they say Mr. Palmer and all his relatives have gone to the underworld, I still won't turn back.</t5076> <t5077>I have business with you, and only you.</t5077>
<t5078>She was utterly astonished:</t5078>
<t5079>- For me! Ah, sir, please hurry up - and if possible - don't be aggressive.</t5079>
<t5080>- Please sit down, I will be quick and not aggressive.</t5080>
<t5081>She hesitated, not knowing what to do.</t5081> <t5082>The possibility that Colonel Brandon might come and see her here suddenly occurred to her.</t5082> <t5083>But she had promised to listen to him, and her curiosity bound her no less than her honor.</t5083> <t5084>Therefore, after a moment of thought, she concluded that prudence required a swift resolution, and she would be able to resolve it if she agreed to follow him.</t5084> <t5085>She silently walked to the table and sat down.</t5085> <t5086>He sat down in the chair opposite, and for half a minute, neither of them spoke a word.</t5086>
<t5087>Elinor lost her patience:</t5087>
<t5088>- Please hurry up.</t5088> <t5089>I don't have much time.</t5089>
<t5090>He was sitting in a contemplative posture, seemingly not hearing anything she said.</t5090>
<t5091>Suddenly, a moment later, he said:</t5091>
<t5092>- Your sister has passed the critical stage.</t5092> <t5093>I heard the servant say.</t5093> <t5094>Thank heavens! But is it true? - is it really true?</t5094>
<t5095>Elinor did not want to speak.</t5095> <t5096>He repeated the question with added anxiety:</t5096>
<t5097>- Tell me, is she out of danger yet, or what?</t5097>
<t5098>- We hope she has pulled through.</t5098>
<t5099>He stood up, walked around the room, then returned to his seat, speaking passionately:</t5099>
<t5100>- If only I had known that just half an hour ago.</t5100> <t5101>But since I am here, what does this mean? Miss Daswood, just once - perhaps for the last time - may you and I enjoy together.</t5101> <t5102>I am in the mood to have fun.</t5102>
<t5103>A blush spread across his cheeks as he continued:</t5103>
<t5104>- Please honestly tell me, do you think I am a scoundrel or a fool?</t5104>
<t5105>Elinor looked at him with more surprise than ever before.</t5105> <t5106>She began to think he must be drunk; such a strange visit, such gestures, seemed impossible to understand in any other way.</t5106> <t5107>With this thought, she immediately stood up and said:</t5107>
<t5108>- Mr. Willoughby, I advise you to return to Combe now.</t5108> <t5109>I don't have the leisure to entertain you any longer.</t5109> <t5110>If you have any business with me, it would be better for you to remember and explain it tomorrow.</t5110>
<t5111>With a knowing smile and a completely calm voice, he said:</t5111>
<t5112>- I understand you; yes, I am very drunk.</t5112> <t5113>A pint of dark beer and some cold cuts at Marlborough are enough to make me drunk.</t5113>
<t5114>Increasingly bewildered, not understanding what he meant, she exclaimed:</t5114>
<t5115>- In Marlborough!</t5115>
<t5116>- Yes, I left London at eight o'clock this morning, and since then I've only gotten off the vehicle for ten minutes to have a light meal in Marlborough.</t5116>
<t5117>The calm demeanor of him and the keen eyes when he spoke made Elinor believe that, regardless of any unforgivable crazy reason he might have for coming to Cleveland, it was not drunkenness that brought him here.</t5117> <t5118>After a little thought, she said:</t5118>
<t5119>- Mr. Willoughby, you must think, and I certainly think - that after what has happened - your coming here in this manner, and compelling me to receive you, requires a very special reason.</t5119> <t5120>What is this reason? What do you mean?</t5120>
<t5121>Very seriously, he said:</t5121>
<t5122>- I mean, if possible, to make you hate me a little less than you do now.</t5122> <t5123>I mean to offer some sort of explanation, some sort of apology, about the past... to bare my soul to you, by convincing you that although I have always been a fool, I have not always been a scoundrel... to be forgiven by Ma... your sister.</t5123>
<t5124>- Is that the real reason why you came here?</t5124>
<t5125>- With all sincerity, exactly like that.</t5125>
<t5126>His passionate tone in the reply made her recall everything about Willoughby from before, and although she wanted to think otherwise, she still believed he was sincere.</t5126>
<t5127>- If that's all, you can be satisfied; because Marianne has forgiven you - she has forgotten you long ago.</t5127>
<t5128>He exclaimed in the same enthusiastic tone:</t5128>
<t5129>- Really? Then she has forgiven me already, sooner than I expected.</t5129> <t5130>But she will forgive me again, with a more justifiable reason.</t5130> <t5131>Do you want to listen to me now?</t5131>
<t5132>Elinor nodded in agreement.</t5132>
<t5133>After a moment of waiting on her part and contemplation on his, he said:</t5133>
<t5134>- I don't know how you explained my behavior to your sister, or what malicious motives you attributed to me.</t5134> <t5135>Perhaps it is difficult for you to think well of me, but you should consider it, and you will hear everything.</t5135>
<t5136>"When I first became close to her family, I had no ulterior motives, no other intention than to have a good time while I was obliged to stay in Devonshire, more comfortable than ever before.</t5136> <t5137>The charming demeanor and captivating gestures of her younger sister only brought me joy; and her attitude towards me almost from the beginning was somewhat...</t5137> <t5138>It is truly strange, when I think back on what it was and how she was, that my heart was so indifferent!"</t5138>
<t5139>"But I must confess, at first I only felt that my own vanity was being glorified.</t5139> <t5140>Not caring about her happiness, only thinking about my own pleasures, always indulging in my emotions, I tried every means within my power to make her pleased with me without intending to reciprocate her feelings."</t5140>
<t5141>At this point, Miss Daswood interrupted, looking at him with the most contemptuous anger, and said:</t5141>
<t5142>- Mr. Willoughby, it is no longer useful for you to recount, or for me to sit and listen.</t5142> <t5143>This kind of beginning cannot continue in any way.</t5143> <t5144>Please do not make me suffer by having to hear any more words on this matter.</t5144>
<t5145>He answered:</t5145>
<t5146>- I ask you to listen to the whole story.</t5146> <t5147>My estate is not large, and I have always spent a lot - always having the habit of associating with people who have higher incomes than myself.</t5147> <t5148>From the time I reached adulthood or even before, each year I fell further into debt.</t5148> <t5149>Although when Mrs. Smith passes away I will be able to pay off all my debts, even this is uncertain and perhaps far off, so for a long time I have intended to restore my situation by marrying a woman with a considerable fortune.</t5149> <t5150>Therefore, I did not think of becoming attached to your sister; and through base, selfish, cruel means - I acted in such a way - to win her affections without any thought of reciprocating.</t5150> <t5151>All the indignation, contempt, even from you, Miss Dashwood, no matter how much you may reproach me, is not enough.</t5151>
<t5152>"But one thing can be said about me: even in the dreadful state of such selfish vanity, I did not foresee the extent of the pain I caused, because at that time I did not know what love was like.</t5152> <t5153>But did I realize anything?</t5153> <t5154>Alright, this can be doubted; because, if I had truly known love, would I have been able to discard my feelings for vanity, for greed? - or, moreover, would I have discarded her feelings?"</t5154>
<t5155>"But I have thrown it away.</t5155> <t5156>To avoid relative poverty, I lost everything just because I wanted to be rich; because her affection and class would surely help me avoid all the horrors of poverty, while I should have seen that even poverty is better luck."</t5156>
<t5157>After a brief pause, Elinor said softly:</t5157>
<t5158>- So, do you believe that at some point you were attached to my sister?</t5158>
<t5159>- Resisting such temptations, resisting such sweetness!</t5159> <t5160>Is there any man in the world who can do that? Yes, I truly find myself fond of her, beyond the level of indifference.</t5160> <t5161>The happiest moments of my life are when I am close to her, when my thoughts are entirely honorable, and my emotions are beyond reproach.</t5161> <t5162>However, even then, when I had firmly decided to confess my feelings to her, day after day I allowed myself to delay that moment, because I did not want to make a commitment while my situation was in disarray.</t5162> <t5163>I do not want to reason here; and I do not want to pause to let her ramble on about the absurdity - and worse than absurdity - when I hesitated to place my trust where I had bound my honor.</t5163>
<t5164>"What followed proved me to be a cunning fool, an occasion to make me despicable and miserable.</t5164> <t5165>However, in the end, I came to a decision, and I was determined, as soon as I had the chance to meet her privately, to explain my attentions to her, and frankly confess to her the feelings I had suffered to express.</t5165> <t5166>But while waiting for such an opportunity - in the hours that were passing - a situation arose - an unusual situation, to extinguish all my resolve, and thereby, dissipate all my comfort."</t5166>
<t5167>Here, he hesitated and lowered his voice:</t5167>
<t5168>- Somehow, Mrs. Smith had been informed - I guess through a distant acquaintance who wanted to strip away her affection for me - about a romantic affair, a lingering matter; but I don't need to explain further myself...</t5168>
<t5169>Blushing red and looking at her inquisitively, he continued:</t5169>
<t5170>- Perhaps she has heard about this a long time ago.</t5170>
<t5171>She also blushed, steeling herself so as not to sympathize with him:</t5171>
<t5172>- I have heard, I have heard everything.</t5172> <t5173>And how you can justify any wrongdoing in this terrible matter, I honestly do not understand.</t5173>
<t5174>Willoughby exclaimed:</t5174>
<t5175>- Please remember who told you this.</t5175> <t5176>Can this be considered impartial?</t5176> <t5177>I acknowledge that I should have respected her circumstances and character.</t5177> <t5178>I do not intend to justify myself, but at the same time, I cannot let her think that I have nothing to justify - that because she is in pain, she is blameless, and because I am a libertine, she must be a saint.</t5178> <t5179>If her emotions were not so intense, her understanding not so weak... but I do not intend to excuse myself.</t5179> <t5180>She deserves to be treated better because of the feelings she has for me.</t5180> <t5181>Many times I harshly blame myself when I recall the affection that, in such a short time, had the power to make me respond.</t5181> <t5182>I hope - I fervently hope - it should never be like that.</t5182>
<t5183>"But I have hurt not only her; I have also hurt a person whose feelings for me (can I say that?) are just as passionate as hers and with a mind - oh! Incomparably superior!"</t5183>
<t5184>- However, your indifferent attitude towards that unfortunate girl - I must say - is unacceptable to me, no matter what you say: your indifference cannot justify your cruel abandonment of her.</t5184> <t5185>Do not think you are forgiven for any reason: whether you were weak, or you did not understand her, in the cruel and wanton manner evident in your character.</t5185> <t5186>You should have known that: while you were enjoying yourself in Devonshire, pursuing new interests, always lively, always cheerful, she had fallen into the utmost misery.</t5186>
<t5187>He passionately replied:</t5187>
<t5188>- But, to be honest, I didn't know about this.</t5188> <t5189>I didn't realize that I had forgotten to let her know where I was, and with just common sense, she could have found me.</t5189>
<t5190>- Alright, sir, what did Mrs. Smith say?</t5190>
<t5191>- She immediately condemned me harshly, and you can imagine how ashamed I was.</t5191> <t5192>Her life was pure, her views were serious, she knew nothing about the outside world - all factors were unfavorable to me.</t5192> <t5193>I could not deny the incident, and every attempt to present the matter in a mitigating light was hopeless.</t5193> <t5194>I believe she was predisposed to think my behavior in general was immoral, and was even more upset about every trivial matter, about the little time I had spent with her.</t5194>
<t5195>"In short, the end result was a breakdown.</t5195> <t5196>But there was a solution by which I could save myself.</t5196> <t5197>Through her noble morality, what a wonderful woman she was!</t5197> <t5198>She promised to forget the past if I agreed to marry Eliza.</t5198> <t5199>But it was impossible; thus, she abandoned me and threw me out of her house."</t5199>
<t5200>"The entire night following this incident - I was to leave the next morning - I pondered deeply about what I should do in the future.</t5200> <t5201>I struggled intensely with my thoughts, but the conclusion came too soon.</t5201> <t5202>My feelings for Marianne, my absolute certainty about her feelings for me - none of it was enough to quell the fear of poverty, nor was it enough to overcome the misguided notions of material wealth that I had long harbored and that society continued to endorse.</t5202> <t5203>I had reason to believe that I would be secure with my current wife, if I chose her, and I thought that once I had chosen the usual prudent course, there would be nothing else to do.</t5203> <t5204>However, a heavy scene awaited me ahead, before I could leave Devonshire."</t5204>
<t5205>"I had arranged to have dinner with her family on that very day, so it was necessary to find some way to apologize for wanting to break this engagement.</t5205> <t5206>But whether I should write a letter of apology or say it myself was something that troubled me endlessly.</t5206> <t5207>I thought it would be very distressing if I met Marianne, and I also doubted whether I could meet her again and still stick to my decision."</t5207>
<t5208>"However, at this point, I underestimated my own generosity, as what follows will show; because I came, I met her, saw her in misery, then left her to her misery - and departed without ever hoping to see her again."</t5208>
<t5209>Elinor said reproachfully:</t5209>
<t5210>- But why did you go there, Mr. Willoughby?</t5210> <t5211>A letter can say it all.</t5211> <t5212>Why was it necessary to go?</t5212>
<t5213>- Necessary for my pride.</t5213> <t5214>I couldn't bear it if I left in a way that might make you, or others in the area, suspect that something had happened between Mrs. Smith and me.</t5214> <t5215>So I was determined to go to the cottage, on the way to Honiton.</t5215> <t5216>However, just seeing your dear sister, I was truly distressed; and it was even worse when I saw she was alone.</t5216> <t5217>All three other members of your family were away, I didn't know where they had gone.</t5217> <t5218>I had just said goodbye to her the night before with a firm resolve to do what needed to be done!</t5218> <t5219>In just a few more hours, she and I would be engaged for life.</t5219> <t5220>I still remember how happy I was, how joyful I was, when I went from the cottage to Allenham, content with myself, and elated with everyone!</t5220>
<t5221>"But that day, the final meeting of our friendship, I met her with an awareness of my mistake that almost took away my ability to conceal it.</t5221> <t5222>When I told her that I was obliged to leave Devonshire immediately, her sadness, her disappointment, her deep regret - I will never forget; while she leaned on me like that, trusted me like that! Oh, heavens!</t5222> <t5223>I am an unfeeling scoundrel!"</t5223>
<t5224>The two people were silent for a few moments.</t5224> <t5225>Elinor spoke first:</t5225>
<t5226>- Did you tell my sister that you would come back soon?</t5226>
<t5227>You lack patience.</t5227>
<t5228>- I don't know what to say to her other than the appropriate things from the past, things that are beyond doubt; but I can't say anything more about what the future will prove.</t5228> <t5229>I can't think of anything; it's no use.</t5229>
<t5230>"Then her mother came to torture me further, with all the kindness and trust she had for me.</t5230> <t5231>Thank heaven! I was truly tortured.</t5231> <t5232>I was miserable. Miss Daswood, you cannot imagine how comforting the torture is when I recall my suffering.</t5232> <t5233>I resent myself for my foolish and wicked heart, to the point that all my past sufferings now seem like triumph and joy to me."</t5233>
<t5234>"Yet, I left, abandoning everything I loved, to go to people for whom at most I felt indifferent.</t5234> <t5235>The trip to the city... using my horses and thus very exhausting... no one to confide in... all feelings were cheerful... when I looked forward, everything was inviting!</t5235> <t5236>When I looked back at Barton, the image was so serene!...</t5236> <t5237>Oh!...</t5237> <t5238>That was a cursed trip!"</t5238>
<t5239>He stopped.</t5239>
<t5240>Even though she pitied him, Elinor became impatient and just wanted him to leave.</t5240> <t5241>She said:</t5241>
<t5242>- Ah, sir, is that all?</t5242>
<t5243>- Is that so! No; have you forgotten what happened in the city?</t5243> <t5244>That shameful letter.</t5244> <t5245>Did she show it to you?</t5245>
<t5246>- Miss, I have reviewed all the letters sent and received.</t5246>
<t5247>- When I received her first letter (right after it was sent, because I was always in the city), what I thought was... in conventional terms, it can't be expressed; in simpler terms, perhaps too simple to evoke any emotion... my feelings were very painful, very painful.</t5247> <t5248>Every line, every word was like - in the clichéd metaphor that the dear writer, if present, would forbid - a blade stabbing into my heart.</t5248> <t5249>In every language, knowing that Marianne was in the city was a thunderbolt.</t5249> <t5250>A thunderbolt and a blade!</t5250> <t5251>Indeed, it was a reproach she made to me!...</t5251> <t5252>Her taste, her concepts - I believe they hold more value than my own self, and I am certain they are more precious.</t5252>
<t5253>Elinor's thoughts had gone through many changes during this conversation and now calmed down again, yet she felt it her duty to control her feelings as follows:</t5253>
<t5254>- Mr. Willoughby, that is improper.</t5254> <t5255>Remember that you are married.</t5255> <t5256>Only speak of the things that your conscience thinks I need to hear.</t5256>
<t5257>- Marianne's letter revived all my regrets, as she affirmed that I was still as dear to her as ever, that despite our weeks of separation, she remained steadfast in her feelings and still believed in my loyalty as always.</t5257> <t5258>I say revived, because time and London, work and play, to some extent had suppressed my regrets.</t5258> <t5259>I had become a hardened deceiver, thinking that I had no feelings for her, wanting to believe that she no longer had any feelings for me.</t5259> <t5260>I told myself that our past attachments were nonsense, trivial, shrugging it off to prove it so, suppressing all reproaches, overcoming all doubts, by occasionally telling myself: 'I would be very happy to hear that she got married.'</t5260> <t5261>'</t5261>
<t5262>"But this letter helps me understand myself better.</t5262> <t5263>I feel that she loves me more than any woman in the world, and that I treated her shamefully.</t5263> <t5264>But at that time, everything between Miss Grey and me had been arranged.</t5264> <t5265>There was no way to back out.</t5265> <t5266>All I had to do was avoid both sisters.</t5266> <t5267>I did not reply to Marianne's letter, intending by this to make her no longer pay attention to me.</t5267> <t5268>For a while, I was determined not to visit Berkeley Street; but eventually, seeing that it was better to create the appearance of a calm, normal relationship rather than anything else, one morning I watched the two ladies leave the house, and then left my card."</t5268>
<t5269>- He followed us out of the house!</t5269>
<t5270>- Even so.</t5270> <t5271>You would be surprised to hear how I have been following you two, how many times I almost wanted to meet you both.</t5271> <t5272>I have sneaked into many shops to avoid being caught by you when the carriage passed by.</t5272> <t5273>Living on Bond Street, almost every day I caught a glimpse of you or your sister; and only my constant vigilance, and a determined desire to avoid you, could have kept us apart for such a long time.</t5273> <t5274>I tried to avoid the Middleton family, as well as others who might know both sides.</t5274> <t5275>However, not knowing that Sir John was in town, I ran into him on the very day he arrived, a day after I came to Mrs. Jennings' house.</t5275> <t5276>He invited me to attend the ball at his house.</t5276> <t5277>If he hadn't encouraged me by saying that you and your sister would be there, I might have attended.</t5277>
<t5278>"The next morning brought another short letter from Marianne, still earnest, open, unpretentious, still trusting - everything that made my character most detestable.</t5278> <t5279>I could not reply to this letter.</t5279> <t5280>I tried, but could not think of a single sentence.</t5280> <t5281>But I thought of her every moment of the day, I believe so."</t5281>
<t5282>"Miss Daswood, if you can pity me, please pity my situation at that time.</t5282> <t5283>With your sister occupying my mind and heart, I was forced to play the role of a happy lover to another woman!</t5283> <t5284>These three or four weeks were the worst.</t5284> <t5285>So, finally, as I don't need to tell you, you understand that evening was truly miserable! On one side was Marianne, beautiful as an angel, calling me 'Willoughby' in such a voice! Oh heavens!</t5285> <t5286>She reached out to me, demanding an explanation, with eyes full of passionate longing looking at me! And on the other side, Sophia, jealous as a demon, staring intently.</t5286> <t5287>But, this doesn't matter, it's over now."</t5287>
<t5288>"It was truly a terrifying evening!</t5288> <t5289>I ran away from the two ladies as fast as I could; but I still managed to see Marianne's gentle face turn as pale as a corpse.</t5289> <t5290>That was the last visage of her that I saw - the final expression she presented before my eyes.</t5290> <t5291>What a horrifying sight!"</t5291>
<t5292>"However, today when I think about her in the moment of her dying, I am somewhat comforted by imagining that I knew exactly what she looked like in the eyes of those who saw her for the last time in her life.</t5292> <t5293>She stood before me, always before me, on my path, with the same expression and demeanor."</t5293>
<t5294>A brief moment for mutual contemplation.</t5294> <t5295>Willoughby stirred first:</t5295>
<t5296>- Alright, allow me to hurry and leave.</t5296> <t5297>Your sister is definitely better, surely out of danger, right?</t5297>
<t5298>- We are absolutely certain of it.</t5298>
<t5299>- And the poor mother of the two girls! - always indulging Marianne.</t5299>
<t5300>- But what about the letter, Mr. Willoughby, your letter; what do you have to say about this?</t5300>
<t5301>- Yes, yes, especially this matter.</t5301> <t5302>You know, your sister wrote to me again, the next morning.</t5302> <t5303>You read what she wrote.</t5303> <t5304>I was having breakfast with the Ellisons, and your sister's letter, along with other correspondence from the inn, was brought to me.</t5304> <t5305>Sophia saw the letter before I did; and the paper size, the elegant type of paper, along with the handwriting, immediately made her suspicious.</t5305> <t5306>She had heard some vague rumors about my relationship with a young girl in Devonshire, and what happened the previous evening made her wonder who this girl was, and made her more jealous than ever.</t5306> <t5307>So, pretending to joke to make her lover happy, she opened the letter herself and read its contents.</t5307> <t5308>Her rude action was justly rewarded.</t5308> <t5309>Her suffering I could endure, but her anger - her malice - in every case had to be soothed.</t5309>
<t5310>"And, to summarize, what do you think of my wife's writing style in her letters? - delicate, sweet, truly feminine - isn't that right?"</t5310>
<t5311>- Your wife! But the letter has your handwriting.</t5311>
<t5312>- Yes, but I only have the labor of a slave copying down such words that I feel ashamed to put my name to.</t5312> <t5313>The original is entirely hers, the happy ideas and the gentle expressions are hers.</t5313> <t5314>But what could I do?</t5314> <t5315>We had made an agreement, everything was prepared, almost the date was set - but I am talking like a fool.</t5315> <t5316>Prepared! Date!</t5316> <t5317>Honestly, I need her money, and in my situation, I must do everything to avoid a breakdown.</t5317>
<t5318>"And after all, in the thoughts of Marianne and her friends, what does my character matter? What does my response in any words matter? There is only one purpose.</t5318> <t5319>My job is to declare myself a scoundrel, and whether I do this by bowing my head or by shouting loudly is not very important.</t5319> <t5320>I tell myself: 'I have vanished from their thoughts, I am completely excluded from their relationships, they think of me as an impolite person, and this letter will only make them think of me as a despicable one'."</t5320>
<t5321>"These are my arguments when, with desperate carelessness, I copied down my wife's words and sent them along with Marianne's last keepsake.</t5321> <t5322>Her three letters - unfortunately in my pocket, otherwise I could deny having them and keep them forever - I was forced to return, and I couldn't even kiss them one last time.</t5322> <t5323>Then the lock of hair - which I also always carried in the same pocket - now searched by the Mistress with the utmost malice to satisfy her... the dear lock of hair... every keepsake... all torn away from me."</t5323>
<t5324>In a tone of compassion, though she did not wish to show it, Elinor said:</t5324>
<t5325>- Mr. Willoughby, you are very wrong, highly reprehensible.</t5325> <t5326>You should not speak to me in such a manner, whether about Mrs. Willoughby or my sister.</t5326> <t5327>You made your choice.</t5327> <t5328>No one forced you.</t5328> <t5329>Your wife has the right to demand at least civility from you, respect from you.</t5329> <t5330>She must have loved you, otherwise she would not have married you.</t5330> <t5331>Speaking of her in a cruel and disdainful manner does not atone for your wrongs towards Marianne, and I do not think it will ease your conscience either.</t5331>
<t5332>He sighed:</t5332>
<t5333>- Don't talk to me about my wife.</t5333> <t5334>She doesn't deserve your sympathy.</t5334> <t5335>She knew I didn't love her when we got married.</t5335> <t5336>But then, we got married and went down to Combe Magna to be happy, and afterwards returned to the city for amusement.</t5336>
<t5337>"And now, do you pity me, Miss Daswood? Or does what I say hold no value at all?</t5337> <t5338>In your mind, am I - even if just a little - less guilty than before?</t5338> <t5339>My intentions were not always bad.</t5339> <t5340>Has my explanation somewhat lessened my guilt?"</t5340>
<t5341>- Yes, certainly you have been somewhat exonerated - a little bit.</t5341> <t5342>Overall, you have proven yourself to be less at fault than I previously thought of you.</t5342> <t5343>You have shown that your heart is less cruel - much less cruel.</t5343> <t5344>But it is hard for me to know... the suffering you have caused... it is hard for me to know what could make it worse.</t5344>
<t5345>- When your sister recovers, could you please tell her what I have told you?</t5345> <t5346>Please allow me to be granted a little leniency in her thoughts, as well as in yours.</t5346> <t5347>You told me that she has forgiven me.</t5347> <t5348>Please allow me the illusion that when she understands more about my heart and my feelings, her forgiveness will become more spontaneous, more natural, more gentle, and less harsh.</t5348> <t5349>Please tell her about my suffering and my repentance.</t5349> <t5350>Tell her that my heart has never wavered in its constancy towards her.</t5350> <t5351>And if possible, please tell her that at this moment, your sister is dearer to me than ever before.</t5351>
<t5352>- I will tell my sister what is necessary about what can be relatively called your justification.</t5352> <t5353>But you have not clearly explained to me the reason you came here today, or how you knew my sister was ill.</t5353>
<t5354>- Last night, in the lobby of Drury Lane, I happened to meet Sir John Middleton.</t5354> <t5355>When he saw me, he spoke to me for the first time in two months.</t5355> <t5356>Since my wedding day, he had cut off relations with me, and I was neither surprised nor displeased.</t5356> <t5357>But now, his kind, simple, foolish nature and his resentment towards me, combined with his concern for his sister, compelled him to tell me things that he knew would cause me terrible torment, though he perhaps did not think it would.</t5357> <t5358>Thus, in a straightforward manner, he told me that Marianne Dashwood was dying of a severe fever at Cleveland - a letter received from Mrs. Jennings in the morning stated that she was on the verge of a critical condition, the Palmer couple had fled in terror, and so on.</t5358>
<t5359>"I was too shocked to appear indifferent even towards the shallow Sir John.</t5359> <t5360>His heart softened when he saw my suffering; and his malice diminished significantly, so much so that when we parted, he almost shook my hand while reminding me of the previous promise about a pointer dog."</t5360>
<t5361>"What I thought when I heard your sister was dying - dying while believing that I was the worst villain in the world, despising me, hating me in her final moments - because how could I say that I couldn't be blamed for those terrible schemes?</t5361> <t5362>There is one person who I am sure would imagine that I could do anything.</t5362> <t5363>What I thought truly made me miserable.</t5363> <t5364>So I made a decision, and at eight o'clock this morning I got into my carriage.</t5364> <t5365>Now you know everything."</t5365>
<t5366>Elinor did not reply.</t5366> <t5367>Her thoughts silently focused on the incurable wound caused by an independent lifestyle from a very young age and the inevitable bad habits of laziness, debauchery, and luxury, formed in the mind and character of a person.</t5367> <t5368>And this person had combined an open and naturally honest temperament with a rich emotional quality.</t5368>
<t5369>The world has made you into an arrogant and frivolous person, and then arrogance and frivolity have made you callous and selfish.</t5369> <t5370>Frivolity, in its quest for victory at the expense of others, has drawn you into a genuine attachment; but arrogance has demanded the sacrifice of this attachment.</t5370> <t5371>All erroneous tendencies lead you to sin, and also lead you to punishment.</t5371>
<t5372>The bond he had severed himself from without regard for honor, without regard for feelings, and without regard for all better benefits, now occupies every thought while no longer being permitted to do so.</t5372> <t5373>The relationship, for which he abandoned her sister with little hesitation, leaving her in sorrow, will surely cause him long-lasting misery.</t5373>
<t5374>From these vague thoughts, she was called back to reality by Willoughby.</t5374> <t5375>He too had awakened from his dreams, at least as painfully.</t5375> <t5376>He was preparing to leave, and said:</t5376>
<t5377>- There's no use in staying any longer; I have to go.</t5377>
<t5378>- Will you return to the city?</t5378>
<t5379>- No; to Combe Magna.</t5379> <t5380>I have some business here, then in one or two days, I'll go back to the city.</t5380> <t5381>Farewell.</t5381>
<t5382>He reached out his hand.</t5382> <t5383>She couldn't refuse to shake his hand; he squeezed her hand with affection.</t5383>
<t5384>He let go of her hand, standing by the fireplace as if he had forgotten that he was about to leave:</t5384>
<t5385>- Do you really think better of me now than you did before?</t5385>
<t5386>Elinor reassured him that she did; that she forgave him, pitied him, and wished him well - even cared about his happiness - and added a few gentle words of advice on how character can create happiness.</t5386>
<t5387>Your answer was not very enthusiastic:</t5387>
<t5388>- Regarding this matter, I must engage with the world as much as possible.</t5388> <t5389>There can be no family happiness.</t5389> <t5390>However, if I am allowed to think that you and your loved ones care about my fate and work, that could be a means... that could help me stay alert... at least a place for me to lean on to live.</t5390> <t5391>Surely I have completely lost Marianne.</t5391> <t5392>If I still have a chance to be free -</t5392>
<t5393>Elinor stopped him with a reproachful look.</t5393>
<t5394>He replied:</t5394>
<t5395>- Alright, farewell once more.</t5395> <t5396>I will leave and live in sorrow because of an event.</t5396>
<t5397>- What do you mean?</t5397>
<t5398>- Your sister's wedding.</t5398>
<t5399>- You were greatly mistaken.</t5399> <t5400>You won't lose her any more than you already have.</t5400>
<t5401>- But someone will get her.</t5401> <t5402>And if that person is himself, I cannot bear it.</t5402> <t5403>But I do not want to stay longer to lose all her sympathetic goodwill by showing that the more I am hurt, the less I want to forgive.</t5403> <t5404>Goodbye; may God bless you!</t5404>
<t5405>With these words, he almost ran out of the room.</t5405>
<t5406>Chapter 45</t5406>
<t5407>A moment after he left, even a moment after the sound of his carriage gradually faded, Elinor was still agitated by a jumble of different but equally distressing thoughts, causing her not to think of even her own sister.</t5407>
<t5408>M</t5408>
<t5409>Willoughby - the person whom she had despised as the most villainous just half an hour ago - Willoughby, despite his faults, had aroused compassion for the sufferings caused by those faults.</t5409> <t5410>This made her soon realize in her heart that she thought of him - as someone her family had completely rejected from now on - with affection and regret, according to his wishes rather than his dignity.</t5410> <t5411>She felt his influence on her mind growing stronger due to circumstances that should have had no reason to affect her; due to that extraordinarily attractive person - whose open, affectionate, and lively manner did not align with the value of this person; due to the love for Marianne that remained passionate while this person was no longer carefree to indulge.</t5411> <t5412>But she felt this way for a long, very long time, before she could see his influence wane.</t5412>
<t5413>When she returned to Marianne, she found her sister just waking up, refreshed after a long and peaceful sleep as she had hoped.</t5413> <t5414>Elinor's soul was overflowing.</t5414> <t5415>The past, the present, the future - Willoughby's visit, Marianne's safety, and the upcoming visit of their mother, all threw her into a whirlwind of emotions that erased any signs of fatigue, but she feared her sister might notice her thoughts.</t5415>
<t5416>However, the time was not long for this fear to affect her, because just half an hour after Willoughby left, the sound of another carriage called her downstairs.</t5416> <t5417>Eager to prevent her mother from experiencing unnecessary confusion, she immediately ran to the front hall and arrived at the outer door just in time to catch her mother and help her into the house.</t5417>
<t5418>Mrs. Dashwood was horrified as she approached the place, almost believing that Marianne was no more, and now could not find her voice to inquire about her younger daughter, nor could she speak to Elinor.</t5418> <t5419>But she did not wait for a greeting or question, immediately delivering the good news.</t5419> <t5420>The mother received the news with all the usual warmth, in a moment filled with joy, just as she had previously been filled with worry.</t5420> <t5421>She was guided into the family room by her daughter and her daughter's friend; and here, wiping away tears of joy though still unable to speak, she embraced Elinor with fervent kisses, occasionally turning to grasp Colonel Brandon's hand, her eyes expressing gratitude and the belief that he shared in her present happiness.</t5421> <t5422>However, he shared it in a less demonstrative manner than she did.</t5422>
<t5423>As soon as Mrs. Dashwood regained her composure, her first desire was to go see Marianne.</t5423> <t5424>Within two minutes, she was beside her beloved daughter - even more beloved now due to separation, suffering, and danger.</t5424> <t5425>Observing the emotions of the two, Elinor's joy was only tempered by the worry that Marianne might not be able to sleep again; but Mrs. Dashwood could remain calm, even cautious, when the life of a child was at stake; and Marianne felt content with her mother beside her and was too weak to converse, following everyone's advice to stay calm and silent.</t5425> <t5426>Mrs. Dashwood would sit by her all night; and Elinor, heeding her mother's plea, went to rest.</t5426>
<t5427>But even after a completely sleepless night and many hours of the most exhausting anxiety, she could not rest, but was mentally agitated.</t5427> <t5428>Willoughby, "poor Willoughby" as she now allowed herself to call him, was always present in her mind; she only heard him justifying himself to the world, sometimes blaming herself, sometimes forgiving herself, for having judged him too harshly.</t5428>
<t5429>But the promise to tell her sister was always painful.</t5429> <t5430>She was afraid of doing this, afraid of the impact on Marianne; wondering if, after hearing such an explanation, her sister could ever be happy with someone else; and for a moment she wished Willoughby would become a widower.</t5430>
<t5431>Then, remembering Colonel Brandon, she blamed herself, thinking that his sufferings and his steadfastness far surpassed those of his rival, and deserved to be rewarded by her sister, then she wished for everything except the death of Mrs. Willoughby.</t5431>
<t5432>The prior warnings from her had helped Mrs. Dashwood to be less shocked when Colonel Brandon arrived at Barton, because she was so worried about Marianne that she decided to go to Cleveland on the same day without waiting for further news.</t5432> <t5433>By that time, she had arranged everything before he arrived, meaning that at any moment the Carey family would come to pick up Margaret to stay with them, as she did not want to take her youngest daughter to a place that could be infected.</t5433>
<t5434>Marianne continues to recover daily.</t5434> <t5435>The bright eyes and cheerful spirit of Mrs. Daswood indicate, as she often declares, that she is one of the happiest women in the world.</t5435> <t5436>Elinor cannot hear the declaration, or the evidence of the declaration, without sometimes wondering if she still remembers anything about Edward.</t5436> <t5437>But even if she believes in what Elinor tells her to some extent about her own disappointment, she is still so drawn into her own joy that she only thinks about what adds to her happiness.</t5437> <t5438>Now, she begins to think that her previous misjudgment, in encouraging the unfortunate attachment to Willoughby, had placed her daughter in an unfavorable situation.</t5438> <t5439>While Marianne recovers, she has an additional source of joy that Elinor does not think of.</t5439>
<t5440>As soon as they had a moment alone, the mother told her:</t5440>
<t5441>- Finally, we are alone.</t5441> <t5442>My dear Elinor, you do not yet know all of my happiness. Colonel Brandon loves Marianne.</t5442> <t5443>He himself told me.</t5443>
<t5444>The daughter of the woman was happy then sad, surprised then not surprised, and still silent.</t5444>
<t5445>- Dear Elinor, you are never like me, otherwise, I would have been worried about your calmness now.</t5445> <t5446>If I had any wish for the good of the family, I could look to Colonel Brandon marrying one of you two sisters as the most desirable goal.</t5446> <t5447>And I believe that out of the two of you, Marianne would be happier with him.</t5447>
<t5448>Elinor somewhat wanted to ask her mother the reason for believing so, as she thought there was no reason based on the impartial grounds of age, temperament, or feelings.</t5448> <t5449>But her mother was given to indulging in any fancy that amused her, and thus instead of questioning, she let it pass with a slight smile.</t5449>
<t5450>- On the way yesterday, he revealed his whole heart to mother without awareness, without calculation.</t5450> <t5451>As you know well, mother cannot converse about anything except her daughter.</t5451> <t5452>He couldn't hide his suffering; mother saw it as much as her own suffering.</t5452> <t5453>And perhaps thinking that mere friendship could not justify such passionate sympathy - or really, mother guesses he wasn't thinking at all - yielding to irresistible emotions, he made mother understand more clearly his earnest, affectionate, and steadfast feelings for Marianne.</t5453> <t5454>Elinor, he has loved your sister since the first moment he met her.</t5454>
<t5455>However, here Elinor realized that it was not the words, not the confession of Colonel Brandon, but the inherent habit of the mother to embellish her illusions in a positive direction to form whatever she found pleasing.</t5455>
<t5456>- His feelings for your sister surpass anything Willoughby ever felt or pretended to feel, being more passionate, more genuine, or more steadfast—whatever we may call it.</t5456> <t5457>His feelings remain unchanged, even knowing that poor Marianne is inclined towards that scoundrel!</t5457> <t5458>He can see her happy with someone else without selfishness—without nurturing hope!</t5458> <t5459>Such a noble soul!—so open, so sincere!—no one could be deceived by him.</t5459>
<t5460>Elinor said:</t5460>
<t5461>- The character of Colonel Brandon has been well-known for a long time.</t5461>
<t5462>The mother said seriously:</t5462>
<t5463>- Mother knows, if not after that warning, she would be the last person to encourage such feelings, or even feel satisfied.</t5463> <t5464>But the manner in which he approached her, through such dynamic and ready friendship, was enough to prove that he was one of the most admirable people.</t5464>
<t5465>Elinor replied:</t5465>
<t5466>- However, his actions were not solely based on a kind gesture through his feelings for Marianne; if we do not consider the humanitarian reason, Mrs. Jennings and the Middleton family have been close to him for a long time, they all value him; and even what you have heard about him, though only recently, is significant.</t5466> <t5467>I hold him in high regard and esteem, so if Marianne could be happy with him, I am ready to think like mother that this is the greatest blessing in the world.</t5467> <t5468>How did mother respond to him?</t5468> <t5469>Did mother allow him to hope?</t5469>
<t5470>- Oh! My dear, I cannot speak of hope with him or with myself.</t5470> <t5471>At that moment, Marianne might be dying.</t5471> <t5472>But he did not ask about hope or encouragement.</t5472> <t5473>This was merely a voluntary confession, an uncontrollable disclosure to a pleasant friend - not to a parent.</t5473> <t5474>However, after a period of confusion, I did say that if your sister survives as I believe, my greatest happiness would be to encourage a marriage between the two of you.</t5474>
<t5475>"Since he and mother came here, since being reassured about your sister, mother has repeated this to him and encouraged him in every way she could.</t5475> <t5476>She told him that time - just a little time - would make everything right.</t5476> <t5477>Marianne's heart should not be wasted on a man like Willoughby.</t5477> <t5478>His own dignity would soon win over her heart."</t5478>
<t5479>- However, considering the Colonel's spirit, mother still hasn't helped him become optimistic.</t5479>
<t5480>- Yes.</t5480> <t5481>He thought Marianne's feelings were too deep to change.</t5481> <t5482>Even if Marianne's heart were free again, he was too modest to believe he could win your sister's affection given the differences in age and temperament.</t5482>
<t5483>"But here, you are mistaken.</t5483> <t5484>Your advanced age only has the advantage of making your character and manners more stable; as for temperament, I believe it is precisely this temperament that will bring happiness to your sister.</t5484> <t5485>And your appearance and gestures are all good.</t5485> <t5486>I am not blinded by prejudice; he is certainly not as handsome as Willoughby, but at the same time, there is something more pleasant about his face.</t5486> <t5487>There is always something... you might remember... sometimes in Willoughby's eyes, that I did not like."</t5487>
<t5488>Elinor could not remember this, but without waiting for her to agree, she continued:</t5488>
<t5489>- Regarding gestures - the Colonel's gestures are not only more pleasant than Willoughby's eyes, but also of the type that mother knows to be more closely attached to Marianne.</t5489> <t5490>The qualities of gentleness, attentiveness to others, and simplicity without ostentation suit the child's temperament better than the often artificial and untimely exuberance of the other man.</t5490> <t5491>Mother clearly sees that, even if Willoughby were truly charming, Marianne would never be as happy with him as she would be with Colonel Brandon.</t5491>
<t5492>She paused.</t5492> <t5493>Her daughter didn't completely agree with her, but she didn't say anything to avoid causing offense</t5493><t5494>.</t5494>
<t5495>Mrs. Dashwood added:</t5495>
<t5496>- At Delaford, my child, you will be conveniently close to your mother even if she remains at Barton; but since I hear this is a large village - it is very likely that there must be a suitable house nearby for us, just like our current living situation.</t5496>
<t5497>Poor Elinor! This is the new plan to bring her to Delaford! - But she has a stubborn spirit.</t5497>
<t5498>- And his estate! Because you know, at this age in life, everyone is concerned about this matter.</t5498> <t5499>And although I don't know or don't want to know exactly how much, I am sure it is a large estate.</t5499>
<t5500>At this point, they were interrupted by someone entering.</t5500> <t5501>Elinor withdrew to reflect in private, to wish her friend success, and yet in doing so, she felt a pang of sympathy for Willoughby.</t5501>
<t5502>Chapter 46</t5502>
<t5503>Marianne's illness did not last long, so she recovered quickly.</t5503> <t5504>With youth, natural strength, and her mother's presence, she improved day by day, and four days after her mother arrived, she was led to the family room.</t5504> <t5505>Sitting there, eager to thank Colonel Brandon for bringing her mother, she requested that he be invited to visit.</t5505>
<t5506>C</t5506>
<t5507>When he entered the room, seeing her altered appearance and receiving her pale hand, he was deeply moved as if - according to Elinor's conjecture - it stemmed from something more than his affection for Marianne.</t5507> <t5508>Soon, through his sorrowful eyes and the change in his complexion as he looked at her, the elder sister recognized many past sufferings resurfacing in his mind; because of the resemblance between Marianne and Eliza, now even more pronounced due to the dark circles under her eyes, her sickly complexion, her weary posture, and her heartfelt gratitude towards him for his extraordinary duty.</t5508>
<t5509>Mrs. Dashwood was also observing attentively, no less than her daughter, but with entirely different thoughts, thus resulting in a completely different effect.</t5509> <t5510>She saw nothing in the Colonel except the simplest and most evident emotion, while through Marianne's gestures and words she believed there was something more than just budding gratitude.</t5510>
<t5511>One or two days later, Marianne was clearly getting better.</t5511> <t5512>Mrs. Dashwood, urged by her own wishes and those of her two daughters, began to talk about returning to Barton.</t5512> <t5513>Her plan depended on persuading two friends: if the Dashwoods stayed, Mrs. Jennings could not leave Cleveland; and the two ladies together requested Colonel Brandon to consider his residence as equally decisive - if not equally essential.</t5513> <t5514>In response, both he and Mrs. Jennings jointly requested Mrs. Dashwood to accept the use of his carriage for the journey back so that her ailing daughter could travel comfortably.</t5514> <t5515>Colonel Brandon, invited by both Mrs. Dashwood and Mrs. Jennings, happily promised to visit the cottage in a few weeks.</t5515>
<t5516>The day of parting and departure had arrived.</t5516> <t5517>Marianne said a special and lengthy farewell to Mrs. Jennings with heartfelt gratitude and respectful kind words, seemingly acknowledging that in the past she had paid little attention to her.</t5517> <t5518>She bid farewell to Colonel Brandon with the intimacy of a friend, being carefully helped into the carriage by him as if he wanted her to take up half of it.</t5518> <t5519>Then Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor followed.</t5519> <t5520>Those who stayed behind talked about those who had left and felt dull, until Mrs. Jennings was called to her carriage to find comfort in her maid's gossip about the separation of the two young ladies; and shortly thereafter, Colonel Brandon was alone on his way back to Delaford.</t5520>
<t5521>The three Daswood family members spent two days on the road, and Marianne endured it well without much fatigue.</t5521> <t5522>Every possible way that the most fervent love and the most attentive care could help make her comfortable was employed by her two companions, each being rewarded by her physical ease and her calm spirit.</t5522> <t5523>Elinor felt particularly pleased when observing her sister's spirit.</t5523> <t5524>She had seen her sister suffer frequently week after week, while she herself was burdened by a sorrow in her heart that she did not have the courage to speak of and did not have the fortitude to conceal.</t5524> <t5525>Now, through incomparable joy, she observed that serene demeanor and believed it to be the result of serious contemplation which had finally brought satisfaction and happiness to her.</t5525>
<t5526>Indeed, as they approached Barton and entered the scenery where each field and each tree brought back memories that were somewhat strange and somewhat sorrowful, the younger sister became pensive and contemplative, turning her face away from everyone's observing eyes, intently gazing out the window.</t5526> <t5527>But with this matter, Elinor could neither worry nor reproach.</t5527> <t5528>When helping her sister down from the carriage and seeing Marianne crying, she only recognized a very natural emotion and felt nothing heavier than compassion.</t5528> <t5529>Such a reaction, which did not disturb anyone, deserved praise.</t5529>
<t5530>In all the subsequent gestures of her sister, Elinor observed the direction of an awakening mind trying to rise reasonably; for as soon as she entered the drawing-room, Marianne cast her eyes around with a determined look, as if immediately resolved to familiarize herself with every object that could relate to thoughts of Willoughby.</t5530> <t5531>She spoke little, but every word aimed at cheerfulness, and though she sometimes sighed, there was always a smile to soften it.</t5531>
<t5532>After dinner, she sat down by the piano; but the first piece of music she laid eyes on was an opera piece that Willoughby had found for her, containing duets that both of them liked, and on the cover was her name in his handwriting.</t5532> <t5533>No.</t5533> <t5534>She shook her head, set the music aside, and after a minute of running her fingers over the keys complaining that her fingers were weak, she closed the piano lid; but resolutely stated that she would practice more later.</t5534>
<t5535>The next morning did not diminish the signs of happiness.</t5535> <t5536>On the contrary, with both her spirit and body revitalized after resting, she looked around and spoke with a more genuine spirit, eagerly anticipating the joy of Margaret's return, talking about the family reunion that would then be restored, about the tasks they would do together, and the pleasant relationships.</t5536>
<t5537>She said:</t5537>
<t5538>- When the weather is good and you are completely healthy, we will walk long distances every day.</t5538> <t5539>We will go to the farm at the end of the hills and see how the children are doing; we will go to Sir John's new farms at Barton Cross and Abbeyland; we will frequently visit the Abbey ruins, trying to trace its foundations as far as possible according to what people say it was built in the old days.</t5539> <t5540>You know we will be happy.</t5540> <t5541>You know the summer will pass joyfully.</t5541> <t5542>I plan to never wake up after six o'clock, and from then until dinner time I will divide my time between playing the piano and reading books.</t5542>
<t5543>"I have made a plan, determined to pursue a serious course of study.</t5543> <t5544>I know our bookshelf too well to use it for anything more than entertainment. But there are many worthwhile works to read at Barton Park; and there are other recently published works that I know can be borrowed from Colonel Brandon.</t5544> <t5545>By reading for six hours a day, within twelve months I can acquire a great deal of knowledge that I currently feel is lacking."</t5545>
<t5546>Elinor praised her sister for a plan that was born in such a noble manner, although she smiled when she saw that the same vivid imagination as before had led her sister to the extremes of laziness in lethargy and irritation in selfishness.</t5546> <t5547>But her smile turned into a sigh when she remembered that she had not fulfilled her promise to Willoughby, fearing that she might stir up Marianne's emotions again and ruin at least a period of tranquility in this busy time.</t5547> <t5548>Therefore, she postponed the dreadful moment, deciding to wait until her sister's health was more assured.</t5548> <t5549>But resolutions are made only to be broken.</t5549>
<t5550>Marianne had to wait two or three days after returning home to have suitable weather for a convalescent like her to go outside.</t5550> <t5551>Finally, a warm and gentle morning appeared - matching the wishes of the daughter and the trust of the mother. Marianne, leaning on Elinor's arm, was allowed to walk until she felt tired, along the road in front of the house.</t5551>
<t5552>The two sisters walked slowly, matching Marianne's feeble strength, which was being tested for the first time since she fell ill.</t5552> <t5553>They only went as far as the spot that opened up to a view of the hill - the significant hill behind them - and then stopped.</t5553> <t5554>Gazing at this hill, Marianne calmly pointed with her hand and said:</t5554>
<t5555>- Over there, exactly over there, on that raised mound - I fell down; and there I met Willoughby for the first time.</t5555>
<t5556>Her voice lowered, but then rose again:</t5556>
<t5557>- I am fortunate to see that I can admire the scenery without much suffering!</t5557> <t5558>Is there any chance we could talk about the matter again, sister Elinor?</t5558>
<t5559>She hesitated further:</t5559>
<t5560>- Or is it a mistake?</t5560> <t5561>Now I wish I could talk about it, because I need to say it out loud.</t5561>
<t5562>Elinor gently encouraged her sister to speak.</t5562>
<t5563>- Speaking of regrets, I have no more regrets about him.</t5563> <t5564>I don't intend to tell you my feelings towards him from before, but rather my feelings now.</t5564> <t5565>At present, if I could be satisfied with one thing, if I were allowed to think that he wasn't always pretending, wasn't always deceiving me; but above all, if I could be sure that he was never as cruel as I had feared and imagined, ever since the story of that unfortunate girl...</t5565>
<t5566>She paused.</t5566>
<t5567>With joy, Elinor respected her sister's words as she replied:</t5567>
<t5568>- If you knew this clearly, do you think you would feel comfortable?</t5568>
<t5569>- Yes.</t5569> <t5570>Surely my mind will be at peace; because not only is it disgusting to suspect someone of such schemes, as he has treated me, but if it is true, then what kind of person am I?</t5570> <t5571>In my situation, what is this if not the most shamefully careless sentiment that has exposed me...</t5571>
<t5572>The older sister asked:</t5572>
<t5573>- So, how do you explain his behavior?</t5573>
<t5574>- I will think of him...</t5574> <t5575>Oh, how satisfied I would be if I thought he was just lacking in determination - very lacking in determination.</t5575>
<t5576>Elinor said nothing more.</t5576> <t5577>She was struggling with whether to start her story now or to wait until Marianne was better, and the two walked in silence for a few minutes.</t5577>
<t5578>Finally, through a sigh, Marianne said:</t5578>
<t5579>- I don't want to think too highly of him when I hope that your private reflections are no more tormenting than my thoughts.</t5579> <t5580>You will suffer enough in these reflections.</t5580>
<t5581>- Are you comparing your character to his character?</t5581>
<t5582>- No.</t5582> <t5583>I compare my conduct with the situation where I should have acted; I compare it with your situation.</t5583>
<t5584>- Our circumstances have very few similarities.</t5584>
<t5585>- There are things beyond just character.</t5585> <t5586>Dear Elinor, do not let your kindness excuse what your judgment must condemn.</t5586> <t5587>My illness has made me reflect - it has given me the leisure and calm to think seriously.</t5587> <t5588>For a long time before I recovered enough to speak, I was fully capable of contemplation.</t5588> <t5589>I have reflected on the past: I see in my behavior, since I first met him last autumn, nothing but imprudence on my part, and unkindness towards others.</t5589>
<t5590>"I have seen that my own feelings have led to my suffering, and my poor endurance almost brought me to the grave.</t5590> <t5591>I have known clearly that my illness was entirely caused by my own negligence towards my health, because even at that time I thought it was a mistake.</t5591> <t5592>If I had died, it would have been self-destruction.</t5592> <t5593>I did not know about my danger until the danger had passed; but I was surprised by my recovery, surprised that the very idea of earnestly wanting to live - wanting time to atone to God and to my family - did not kill me immediately.</t5593> <t5594>If I had died, what extraordinary sorrow I would have left for you, my caregiver, my friend, my sister!</t5594> <t5595>You, who have seen in recent days all the selfishness in my irritability; who have known every whisper of my heart!</t5595> <t5596>How could I be present in your memories after I died!</t5596> <t5597>And mother too! How could you comfort mother after I died!"</t5597>
<t5598>"I cannot describe my disgust with myself.</t5598> <t5599>Whenever I look back at the past, I always see some duty I neglected, or some mistake I indulged.</t5599> <t5600>It seems like everyone has been hurt because of me.</t5600> <t5601>The kindness, the unceasing kindness of Mrs. Jennings, I responded to with contempt in ingratitude.</t5601> <t5602>With the Middleton family, with the Palmer family, the Steele sisters, even with mere acquaintances, I have been rude and unjust.</t5602> <t5603>With John, with Fanny, - yes, even with you - though they don't quite deserve it, I have been less than fair."</t5603>
<t5604>"But you, more than anyone else, more than even mother, have been troubled by me.</t5604> <t5605>I, and only I, have understood your heart and its sufferings; yet, what has this understanding done for me? - Not to gain any sympathy that could help either you or me.</t5605> <t5606>You have set a bright example before me, but how have I followed your example?</t5606> <t5607>Have I been considerate of you and your comfort? Have I learned from your endurance, or have I eased your restraints?</t5607> <t5608>If so, then I would have shared with you in the matters of care or repaid the favor instead of letting you bear it all alone until now.</t5608> <t5609>No; nothing."</t5609>
<t5610>"Even when I knew you were in pain or at ease, I turned my back on duty or companionship; only allowing myself to be sorrowful, only worrying about the heart that had abandoned and treated me unfairly, letting you suffer because of me while I confessed my boundless love for you."</t5610>
<t5611>Stop here to cease the self-reproaching thoughts.</t5611> <t5612>Eager to soothe but too modest to be self-satisfied, Elinor immediately praised and agreed in a fitting manner with her sister's frankness and remorse.</t5612>
<t5613>Marianne held her sister's hand tightly and replied:</t5613>
<t5614>- You are very kind.</t5614> <t5615>The future will prove it to you.</t5615> <t5616>I have outlined my plan, and if I have the ability to follow this plan, my emotions will be controlled and my temper will be corrected.</t5616> <t5617>Others will no longer have to worry, and I will no longer have to endure torment.</t5617> <t5618>Now I will live only for our family.</t5618> <t5619>You, mother, and Margaret, from now on must be everything to me.</t5619> <t5620>I will never again feel any urge to leave you, to leave the family.</t5620> <t5621>And if I have other associations, it will only be to show that I have humbled myself, my heart has been corrected, and I can carry out the small interactions and obligations of life with calmness and generosity.</t5621>
<t5622>"As for Willoughby, it's no use saying that I will soon forget or that I will never forget him.</t5622> <t5623>I can get over the memory of him without any change in circumstances or opinions.</t5623> <t5624>But this memory can be regulated, can be controlled by religion, by reason, by busy work."</t5624>
<t5625>She paused, then continued in a lower voice:</t5625>
<t5626>- If only you could understand his thoughts, everything would become easier.</t5626>
<t5627>Elinor pondered whether she should take the risk of telling her sister about him or not.</t5627> <t5628>Now, hearing her sister speak like that, she realized that constant thinking wouldn't achieve anything, so she needed to be resolute, and gradually she came to a decision.</t5628>
<t5629>She tried skillfully, as she hoped, to present; to prepare her sister's spirit in advance; then recounted simply and honestly the main points on which Willoughby based his apology; fair to his remorse; and only softened his current emotional complaints.</t5629> <t5630>Marianne did not say a word; she trembled, her eyes fixed on the ground, and her lips turned pale.</t5630> <t5631>A thousand questions surged in her heart, but she did not dare to voice any of them.</t5631> <t5632>She grasped every word with anxious longing; her hand unconsciously clutched her sister's, and tears streamed down her cheeks.</t5632>
<t5633>Fearing that her sister might be tired, Elinor led her back.</t5633> <t5634>On the way home, she could easily guess how curious her sister was despite not asking any questions, so she only talked about Willoughby and the conversation between herself and Willoughby.</t5634> <t5635>She carefully went into detail about every word and gesture, things that could be revealed in detail without causing any negative impact.</t5635> <t5636>As soon as the two entered the house, Marianne kissed her sister to show her gratitude, and only said briefly through her tears: "Tell mother," then broke away from her sister and slowly walked up the stairs.</t5636>
<t5637>Elinor did not want to disturb the solitude that her sister rightfully needed.</t5637> <t5638>Occupied with thoughts of preparing to deal with the consequences and determined to bring up the subject again if Marianne remained silent, she turned into the hallway and had to accept leaving her sister alone.</t5638>
<t5639>Chapter 47</t5639>
<t5640>Mrs. Dashwood could not help but feel emotional when she heard confirmation about the person she once cherished.</t5640> <t5641>She was pleased that some of the wrongs he was accused of had been cleared; she felt sorry for him and wished him happiness.</t5641> <t5642>But she could not regain the feelings of the past.</t5642> <t5643>Nothing could restore him to complete trust and affection - an unblemished character in Marianne's eyes.</t5643> <t5644>Nothing could erase the thought of the suffering Marianne had endured due to his cowardice, or his wrongdoings towards Eliza.</t5644> <t5645>Therefore, nothing could replace him in her former esteem, nor could anything diminish the merits of Colonel Brandon.</t5645>
<t5646>B</t5646>
<t5647>If Mrs. Dashwood, like her daughter, had heard Willoughby's story from his own words - if she had witnessed his suffering, influenced by his expressions and gestures - perhaps she would have felt more compassion for him.</t5647> <t5648>But Elinor neither had the ability nor the desire to explain in detail to evoke such emotions in others as had been evoked in her.</t5648> <t5649>Thoughts had made her judgment calm and her opinion of Willoughby clear-headed.</t5649> <t5650>Therefore, she only wished to recount the simple truth and present the actual facts as they were due to his character, without embellishing to lead the imagination too far.</t5650>
<t5651>In the evening, when the three of them were sitting close together, Marianne proactively began to talk about him again; but she was still trying and contemplating the fluctuating emotions she had experienced moments before.</t5651> <t5652>She blushed as she spoke in a steady, clear voice:</t5652>
<t5653>- Mom and sister, please rest assured that now I have seen everything - just as you wanted me to see.</t5653>
<t5654>Mrs. Daswood would have immediately interrupted her in a gentle manner to soothe, if Elinor had not signaled her to remain silent, as she wanted to hear her sister's honest opinion.</t5654>
<t5655>Marianne slowly continued:</t5655>
<t5656>- I feel much relieved - what Ms. Elinor told me this morning - now I hear exactly what I wanted to hear.</t5656>
<t5657>For a moment her voice faded, but she regained her composure, and with a calmer demeanor she added:</t5657>
<t5658>- Now I am completely content; I do not wish for any change.</t5658> <t5659>If I had known all of this before - and sooner or later I would have known - I would never have been happy with him.</t5659> <t5660>At that time, I would have lost faith, lost respect.</t5660> <t5661>Nothing could erase this thought.</t5661>
<t5662>The mother exclaimed:</t5662>
<t5663>- I know - I know well.</t5663> <t5664>How can one be happy with a libertine!</t5664> <t5665>With someone who has disturbed the peace of the closest among our friends, and who is the best person?</t5665> <t5666>No - my Marianne does not have a heart meant to be happy with such a person! Your conscience - your sensitive conscience - would surely feel everything that your husband's conscience ought to feel.</t5666>
<t5667>Marianne sighed, repeating:</t5667>
<t5668>- I don't expect any changes.</t5668>
<t5669>Elinor said:</t5669>
<t5670>- You have judged the matter as a clear mind and mature understanding should judge it.</t5670> <t5671>Just like you, not only in this matter but in many other circumstances, you believe that you have found enough reasons to confirm that your marriage would surely lead you into many complications and disappointments, from which you cannot recover with his love, which is now much less certain.</t5671>
<t5672>"If you marry him, you will always be poor.</t5672> <t5673>He himself has admitted that he spends lavishly, and his character shows that he can hardly understand the meaning of the word moderation.</t5673> <t5674>His material demands and his lack of experience, with a small - very small - income, will surely bring suffering no less painful for you, because you had not known and had not thought of it before."</t5674>
<t5675>"I know that when you realize the situation, your sense of honor and honesty will surely compel you to economize in every possible matter.</t5675> <t5676>Perhaps you will only scrimp to limit your own comforts, thus making yourself suffer, but beyond that... and how can you alone, despite your utmost efforts, prevent the risk of bankruptcy that had already begun before marriage?</t5676> <t5677>Beyond that, even if you reasonably try to limit his indulgences, is there a fear</t5677> <t5678>that, instead of him restraining his selfish thoughts to agree with you, you might lose the affection in his heart and make him regret marrying you as he falls into those difficulties?"</t5678>
<t5679>Marianne's lips trembled, and she repeated the word "selfish" with a tone that implied "do you really think he is selfish?"</t5679>
<t5680>Elinor replied:</t5680>
<t5681>- All his actions from the beginning to the end of the incident were based on selfishness.</t5681> <t5682>It was selfishness that made him initially toy with your feelings; then later, when he had that engagement, it made him hesitate to confess to you, and ultimately it made him leave Barton.</t5682> <t5683>In every situation, his guiding principle was either pleasure for himself or comfort for himself.</t5683>
<t5684>- That's true.</t5684> <t5685>Your happiness was never his goal.</t5685>
<t5686>Elinor continued:</t5686>
<t5687>- Now, he is regretting what he has done.</t5687><t5688>And why does he regret it?</t5688><t5689>Because he feels that what he did did not meet his expectations.</t5689><t5690>He is not happy.</t5690><t5691>His current situation is not shameful - he is not suffering from poverty; it's just that he thinks he married a woman who is not as gentle as you.</t5691><t5692>But can it be inferred from this that if he had married you, he would be happy?</t5692><t5693>The difficulties would be of a different nature.</t5693><t5694>At that time, he would suffer from the poverty that he now sees as nothing because he has escaped it.</t5694><t5695>He would have a wife whose temperament he could not complain about, but he would always be distressed - always poor.</t5695><t5696>Then perhaps soon he would see that the comforts of a spacious estate and a high income are much more important - even for marital happiness - compared to the temperament of the wife.</t5696>
<t5697>Marianne said:</t5697>
<t5698>- I have no doubts about this, there is nothing to regret - nothing except for my arrogance.</t5698>
<t5699>Mrs. Daswood said:</t5699>
<t5700>- My child, it should be said that it was due to your mother's carelessness.</t5700> <t5701>This old woman must take responsibility.</t5701>
<t5702>Marianne did not let her continue.</t5702>
<t5703>Elinor was pleased to see that everyone had recognized their mistakes, and she wanted to avoid dissecting the past, which could dampen her sister's spirits, so she immediately continued to return to the original topic:</t5703>
<t5704>- You could derive one observation from the whole affair - that is, all of Willoughby's difficulties stem from the initial moral transgression in his conduct towards Eliza Williams.</t5704> <t5705>This transgression is the source of all the smaller wrongdoings that followed, and of all his current discontent.</t5705>
<t5706>Marianne deeply agreed with the remark; and her mother was prompted by it to recount the sorrows and dignity of Colonel Brandon, through the fervor of friendship and the intention that might unite to voice persuasion.</t5706> <t5707>However, her younger daughter did not seem to have listened to all she said.</t5707>
<t5708>Two or three days later, Elinor noticed that Marianne's health was not continuing to recover as before, but she still maintained a resolute will, striving to appear cheerful and comfortable; thus, her sister could be reassured that time would help improve her health.</t5708>
<t5709>Margaret returned.</t5709> <t5710>Finally, the whole family was reunited, once again settling peacefully in the vacation home.</t5710> <t5711>If they did not pursue their studies with the same enthusiasm as when they first arrived in Barton, at least they planned for the future.</t5711>
<t5712>Elinor was eager to hear good news about Edward.</t5712> <t5713>Since leaving London, she had not heard any news about him, nothing new about his plans, and nothing certain even about his current residence.</t5713> <t5714>Several letters had been exchanged between her and her brother regarding Marianne's illness; and in John's first letter, there was this sentence: "We have not heard anything about unfortunate Edward, and cannot inquire about such a forbidden matter, but we guess he is still at Oxford." This was all the news about Edward that she received through letters,</t5714><t5715>as the subsequent letters did not even mention his name.</t5715> <t5716>However, she did not have to remain in the dark about Edward's news for long.</t5716>
<t5717>One morning, the butler was sent to Exeter to handle some business.</t5717> <t5718>Upon his return, the mistress's inquiries about the events of the trip were satisfied as he voluntarily recounted them while attending at the dining table:</t5718>
<t5719>- Madam, I think you know that Mr. Ferrars has gotten married.</t5719>
<t5720>Marianne started, staring at Elinor, noticing her sister's pale face, then she leaned back in her chair in agitation.</t5720> <t5721>When responding to the butler, the mother instinctively followed the same direction with her eyes, shocked to realize from Elinor's expression that she was truly distressed, and in the next moment, she was equally troubled by Marianne's condition, not knowing which daughter to attend to.</t5721>
<t5722>The butler only saw that Marianne fell ill, having enough consciousness to call a maid to assist Mrs. Dashwood in helping her move to another room.</t5722> <t5723>At this moment, Marianne had regained her composure, and her mother left her in the care of Margaret and the maid, then returned to Elinor.</t5723> <t5724>The eldest daughter, though still quite distressed, had recovered enough to think and speak, preparing to question Thomas - now her source of information.</t5724> <t5725>Immediately, Mrs. Dashwood took on the difficult task herself, and Elinor received the information without having to struggle with inquiries.</t5725>
<t5726>- Thomas, who told you that Mr. Ferrars had gotten married?</t5726>
<t5727>- Madam, I saw Mr. Ferrars with my own eyes this morning in Exeter, and his wife too, who was Miss Steele before.</t5727> <t5728>Their carriage was stopping in front of the New London Inn, as I was there to deliver a letter from Sally to her brother, who is the postman here.</t5728> <t5729>I happened to look up when the carriage passed by, and I saw it was indeed Miss Steele from before; so I tipped my hat in greeting.</t5729> <t5730>She recognized me and called me over, then inquired about you and the young ladies, especially Miss Marianne, asking me to convey her and Mr. Ferrars' regards, expressing regret that they did not have time to visit your family as they were in a hurry; but assured that they would certainly visit upon their return.</t5730>
<t5731>- But did she say she was married, Thomas?</t5731>
<t5732>- Madam, yes.</t5732> <t5733>She smiled, explaining how she had changed her surname while being here.</t5733> <t5734>She was always a very amiable and open young woman, behaving very politely.</t5734> <t5735>Therefore, I took the liberty of wishing her happiness.</t5735>
<t5736>- Did Mr. Ferrars go in the car with her?</t5736>
<t5737>- Yes, ma'am, there is.</t5737> <t5738>I only caught a glimpse of him reclining in the car, but he didn't look up - he has always been very reserved.</t5738>
<t5739>Elinor's thoughts could easily explain why he did not show his face, and the mother might have found the same explanation.</t5739>
<t5740>- Is there anyone else in the car?</t5740>
<t5741>- Madam, no, there are only two people.</t5741>
<t5742>- Do you know where they come from?</t5742>
<t5743>- Two people came from the city, because Miss Lucy, that is Mrs. Ferrars, said so.</t5743>
<t5744>- Did they go to the east?</t5744>
<t5745>- Yes, ma'am, but they won't be gone long.</t5745> <t5746>They will return soon, and when they do, they will certainly come here to visit.</t5746>
<t5747>Mrs. Dashwood now looked over at her daughter, but Elinor had already guessed what they were about.</t5747> <t5748>She had recognized all of Lucy's character in the message, and was certain that Edward would never come near their family.</t5748> <t5749>She whispered to her mother that they must be going to Mr. Pratt's house, near Plymouth.</t5749>
<t5750>Thomas's information seemed to have run out.</t5750> <t5751>Elinor appeared as if she was hoping to hear more.</t5751>
<t5752>- Before you left, did you see them leave?</t5752>
<t5753>- Madam, no - they just brought out some horses, but I can't stay any longer; I'm afraid of getting home late.</t5753>
<t5754>- Did Mrs. Ferrars look well?</t5754>
<t5755>- Yes, madam, she speaks very well; I find her always to be a lovely young woman, and she seems very content.</t5755>
<t5756>Mrs. Dashwood could not think of any other questions.</t5756> <t5757>Both Thomas and the tablecloth, now equally useless, were taken out of the room.</t5757> <t5758>Marianne had someone convey that she would not eat anything more.</t5758> <t5759>Neither Mrs. Dashwood nor Elinor could continue eating; while Margaret might consider herself very fortunate because with both her elder sisters feeling unwell for various reasons, which made them indifferent to eating, she was never forced to stop eating.</t5759>
<t5760>When the servants brought out dessert and wine, Mrs. Daswood and Elinor requested to be left alone, so for a while, both were immersed in their own silent thoughts.</t5760> <t5761>Mrs. Daswood, afraid of making any careless remarks, did not dare to offer words of comfort.</t5761> <t5762>Now she realized that she had been mistaken in relying on Elinor's account of her situation; and rightly concluded that everything had been softened at that time to prevent her from feeling more sorrow, to avoid the suffering she had endured because of Marianne.</t5762> <t5763>She felt that she had been deceived by her daughter's considerate and attentive demeanor.</t5763>
<t5764>From that point on, she thought the bond, which at times she understood clearly, was not actually deeper than she wanted to believe, or more than what she now expressed.</t5764> <t5765>She feared that by the way she had trusted before, she had become unfair, indifferent - no - almost harsh towards Elinor.</t5765> <t5766>She also realized that, because Marianne's suffering was more openly expressed and closer to her, the younger sister had occupied her affection, making her forget that through Elinor she also had a similarly suffering daughter, certainly less self-tormenting, and more resilient.</t5766>
<t5767>Chapter 48</t5767>
<t5768>Now, Elinor realized the difference between, on one hand, expecting an event that is not as desired regardless of how one wishes to think, and on the other hand, the actual reality of this event.</t5768> <t5769>Now she saw, though not intentionally, that she had always harbored hope - as long as he was still free - that something would obstruct the marriage between Edward and Lucy; that he would be determined in some way, that his friends would advise him in some way, that some more appropriate opportunity would help the other woman settle her life - to bring happiness to all.</t5769> <t5770>But now he was married, and she blamed herself for being overly confident to the point of now suffering sorrow.</t5770>
<t5771>B</t5771>
<t5772>At first, she was a little surprised because he had to get married early, before (as she imagined) he could be ordained and thereby take on the position.</t5772> <t5773>But then she thought that perhaps Lucy did not want to risk delaying because she was cautious and wanted to secure him as soon as possible.</t5773> <t5774>They had gotten married - married in the city - and now were hastily going down to his uncle's house. What was Edward thinking when he was four miles away from Barton, when he saw her mother's steward, when he heard Lucy's message?</t5774>
<t5775>She guessed it wouldn't be long before they settled in Delaford, - Delaford, a place where many events had intertwined to draw her attention, making her wish to be acquainted, yet wanting to avoid it.</t5775> <t5776>In her mind, she pictured the scene of the two living together in the parsonage.</t5776> <t5777>Through Lucy, she saw: an energetic, resourceful housewife, combining a desire for outward elegance with extreme frugality (and ashamedly doubting half of her own financial capabilities); pursuing her interests in every thought, winning the affection of Colonel Brandon, of Mrs. Jennings, and of all wealthy friends.</t5777> <t5778>Through Edward: she didn't know what she saw, and didn't want to see; happiness or misery, - neither brought her joy; she turned away from every detail of him.</t5778>
<t5779>Elinor believed that someone in London, acquainted with both parties, would write with news and detailed information, but as each day passed without any letters, no good news arrived.</t5779> <t5780>Though unsure who to blame, she reproached everyone she knew.</t5780> <t5781>All were thoughtless or lazy.</t5781> <t5782>A question arose from her impatient mind, eager for some news:</t5782>
<t5783>- Mom, when will you write a letter to Colonel Brandon?</t5783>
<t5784>- Dear child, I wrote to him last week, and I hope to see him again rather than receive news.</t5784> <t5785>I have earnestly invited him to our family, and I would not be surprised to see him come today or tomorrow, or any day.</t5785>
<t5786>So, something has been received - something to look forward to.</t5786> <t5787>Colonel Brandon must have news to report to her.</t5787>
<t5788>As soon as she determined this, the figure of a person on horseback caught her eye through the window.</t5788> <t5789>This person stopped in front of the gate.</t5789> <t5790>It was a man, none other than Colonel Brandon.</t5790> <t5791>Now more news could be known, and she trembled at the thought of it.</t5791> <t5792>But - this was not Colonel Brandon - nor was it his demeanor or his height.</t5792> <t5793>She looked again.</t5793> <t5794>This person had just dismounted, she could not be mistaken - it was Edward.</t5794> <t5795>She stepped back and sat down.</t5795> <t5796>"He has come from Mr. Pratt's house with the purpose of visiting his family.</t5796> <t5797>I must remain calm, I will be the mistress of myself."</t5797>
<t5798>In the same moment, she realized that her mother and siblings also knew they had been mistaken like her.</t5798> <t5799>She saw her mother and Marianne turn pale; saw the two of them looking at her, whispering a few words together.</t5799> <t5800>She could sacrifice everything for the ability to speak - and to make the two understand that she hoped they wouldn't be indifferent or disdainful towards him; but she couldn't utter a word, forced to let the two act entirely at their discretion.</t5800>
<t5801>Not a single word was uttered.</t5801> <t5802>All three people silently waited for the guest to appear.</t5802> <t5803>They heard his footsteps along the gravel path; in a moment he entered the hallway, and the next moment he was standing before the three of them.</t5803>
<t5804>When he entered, his expression was not very heavy, even towards Elinor.</t5804> <t5805>His complexion was pale due to agitation; and he appeared as if wondering how he would be received, conscious that he did not deserve a kind reception.</t5805> <t5806>However, Mrs. Dashwood, following her daughter's wishes, she thought, as if guided by her in everything, to show the warmth from her soul, extended her hand to him, wishing him well.</t5806>
<t5807>He blushed, stammering an answer that no one could hear clearly.</t5807> <t5808>Elinor's lips moved along with her mother's; and when the gesture was done, she wished she had also shaken his hand.</t5808> <t5809>But now it was too late.</t5809> <t5810>With a seemingly open expression, she sat down again and talked about the weather.</t5810>
<t5811>Marianne tried to withdraw from everyone's sight to hide her distress.</t5811> <t5812>Margaret understood part of it, but not the whole situation, thinking she should appear solemn, so she sat as far away from him as possible, maintaining absolute silence.</t5812>
<t5813>When Elinor finished her cheerful exchange about the dry weather, an uncomfortable silence ensued.</t5813> <t5814>Mrs. Dashwood ended this situation, naturally believing that he had left Mrs. Ferrars at home in good health.</t5814> <t5815>In a hurried tone, he affirmed.</t5815>
<t5816>Another moment of silence.</t5816>
<t5817>Elinor was determined to make an effort herself, though she was apprehensive about her own voice:</t5817>
<t5818>- Is Mrs. Ferrars staying at Longstaple?</t5818>
<t5819>He showed a look of surprise and replied:</t5819>
<t5820>- At Longstaple! No, my mother is in the city.</t5820>
<t5821>Elinor picked up a piece of needlework on the table that she had been working on, and said:</t5821>
<t5822>- I meant to inquire about Mrs. Edward Ferrars.</t5822>
<t5823>She did not dare to look up; but both her mother and Marianne turned to look at him.</t5823> <t5824>He blushed, seeming confused, showing a doubtful expression, then after a little hesitation, said:</t5824>
<t5825>- Perhaps you mean... my brother... you mean Mrs... Mrs. Robert Ferrars.</t5825>
<t5826>- Mrs. Robert Ferrars!</t5826>
<t5827>Both Marianne and her mother repeated in a tone of utmost astonishment; and although Elinor could not utter a word, even her gaze fixed on him conveyed the same impatient amazement.</t5827> <t5828>He stood up, walked to the window as if not knowing what to do; picked up a pair of scissors lying there, and while cutting the cover into pieces, he spoke in a hurried tone:</t5828>
<t5829>- Perhaps you don't know... you haven't heard that my brother finally got married... married the younger sister... married Miss Lucy Steele.</t5829>
<t5830>His words echoed back with the utmost astonishment of everyone.</t5830> <t5831>Except for Elinor, sitting with her face bent over her work, in a state of agitation that made it difficult for her to know where she was in her task.</t5831>
<t5832>He continued:</t5832>
<t5833>- Yes, they got married last week and are currently in Dawlish.</t5833>
<t5834>Elinor could not remain seated any longer.</t5834> <t5835>She almost ran out of the room, and as soon as the door closed, she burst into tears of joy, which at first she thought would never end.</t5835>
<t5836>Edward, up until now looking everywhere except at her, saw her run away, perhaps sensing - or rather hearing - her agitation; for immediately he fell into his own reverie, into which no remarks, inquiries, or affectionate words from Mrs. Daswood could penetrate.</t5836> <t5837>Finally, without uttering a word, he left the room and walked towards the village, leaving the three of them in extreme surprise and bewilderment at the change in his circumstances, so miraculous and so sudden - a bewilderment that they had no way of explaining except through their own conjectures.</t5837>
<t5838>Chapter 49</t5838>
<t5839>Even though the circumstances of his release seemed confusing to the whole family, what was certain was that Edward was free.</t5839> <t5840>The issue was that everyone could easily predict what the freedom would be used for.</t5840> <t5841>Because, after experiencing the blessings of a careless engagement - an engagement not approved by his mother but lasting four years - when this engagement fell apart, nothing more was expected than another engagement.</t5841>
<t5842>D</t5842>
<t5843>In fact, his trip to Barton had a simple purpose.</t5843> <t5844>It was to ask Elinor to marry him.</t5844> <t5845>Knowing that he was not inexperienced in such matters, it might seem strange that he appeared so awkward in the current situation, to the point of needing encouragement and the outdoor atmosphere.</t5845>
<t5846>However, there is no need to recount how long it took him to reach a true resolution, how long it took for him to have the opportunity to act, how he revealed his intentions, and how he was responded to.</t5846> <t5847>It can simply be said like this: when they sat down for dinner at four o'clock, three hours after he arrived, he had been accepted by her, approved by her mother; and was immersed in the passionate revelations not only of a person in love, but also of the happiest man among all men, in the reality of reason and truth.</t5847>
<t5848>His joy exceeded the usual limits.</t5848> <t5849>What he had achieved was more than the usual triumph of a love accepted to fill his heart and elevate his spirit.</t5849> <t5850>He was also liberated without any self-reproach, freed from the entanglement that had long tormented him, freed from the woman he had not loved for a long time - and then elevated to a stable state with another person, whom he had thought of almost hopelessly, even as he had considered with longing.</t5850> <t5851>He was transferred not from doubt or suspense - but from misery - to happiness.</t5851> <t5852>The transformation was expressed through genuine, overflowing, grateful joy - which those who knew him had never witnessed before.</t5852>
<t5853>His heart now laid bare to Elinor: all its weaknesses, all its mistakes confessed; and the initial attachment to Lucy in his youth recounted with all the brave dignity of twenty-four years.</t5853> <t5854>He said:</t5854>
<t5855>- This is your foolish, lazy tendency, the consequence of ignorance about life - and having no job.</t5855> <t5856>If your younger brother had given you an active profession when you broke away from Mr. Pratt's guardianship at the age of eighteen, you think - no, you are certain - this would never have happened.</t5856> <t5857>Because, although you left Longstaple with what you thought at the time - an unbreakable attachment to Mr. Pratt's niece - if you had a job to pursue, a purpose to occupy your time and separate you from her for a few months, you would have matured and overcome the infatuation, especially after mingling more with the world - which you should have done.</t5857> <t5858>But instead of finding something to do, instead of taking up a profession chosen for you or one you were allowed to choose, you returned home completely idle.</t5858>
<t5859>"In the first twelve months after that (because he didn't enter Oxford until he was nineteen), he didn't take on even nominal work that the university could have given him.</t5859> <t5860>Therefore, he had nothing to do except indulge in the illusion that he was in love.</t5860> <t5861>Also because his mother didn't help him have a comfortable material life, because he had no friends, his siblings were not close to each other, and he had an aversion to new relationships; it was natural that he often went to Longstaple, where he always felt at home, where he was always sure to be welcomed.</t5861> <t5862>And so, most of his time from eighteen to nineteen was spent here: Lucy appeared to be everything lovely and indulgent.</t5862> <t5863>She was also pretty - at least he thought so at the time, and because he wasn't familiar with many women, he couldn't compare and didn't see any flaws."</t5863>
<t5864>"Therefore, considering everything, with such a foolish engagement - foolish in every aspect as it later proved - at that time it was a naturally reckless and forgivable act - he hoped so."</t5864>
<t5865>The change, which in just a few hours flooded the thoughts and happiness of the Daswood family, was so immense that it promised everyone a sleepless night of contentment.</t5865> <t5866>Mrs. Daswood was so happy that she couldn't be at ease, not knowing how to cherish Edward enough or praise Elinor sufficiently - how to show appreciation for his release without hurting his sensitivity, or how to let them freely converse together while still sitting with them and sharing in their joy.</t5866>
<t5867>Marianne could only express her happiness through tears.</t5867> <t5868>Comparisons also arose, regrets also surfaced; and her joy, though as sincere as her love for her sister, belonged to a kind that could not provide her with spirit or words.</t5868>
<t5869>But Elinor, how could one describe her feelings?</t5869> <t5870>From the moment she learned that Lucy married someone else, Edward was free, until the moment he confirmed her subsequent hopes right after that, she could not remain calm. But when the second period had passed - when she saw that all doubts, all worries had been removed; when comparing her current situation with the recent past; when she saw him honorably released from the previous engagement; when she saw him immediately take advantage of the release to express to her and affirm a love so tender, so steadfast as she had always wished - she was overwhelmed, she was overpowered by her own immense happiness.</t5870> <t5871>It took many hours for her mind to be at peace, or for her heart to be calm.</t5871>
<t5872>Edward was now arranged to stay at the holiday house for a week; because whatever he was required to do, it was impossible to spend less than a week to satisfy Elinor's family, or enough to say half of what he wanted to say about the past, present, and future.</t5872> <t5873>Although a few hours of diligent, uninterrupted talking would be enough to resolve all topics between any two rational people, it is entirely different for those in love.</t5873> <t5874>Between two lovers, no topic can end, no conversation can conclude, if it hasn't been discussed at least twenty times.</t5874>
<t5875>Lucy’s wedding, a perpetual and reasonable concern, was naturally the subject of one of the first conversations between the two lovers.</t5875> <t5876>Having known both husband and wife, from every angle Elinor found this marriage to be one of the most peculiar and inexplicable situations she had ever heard of.</t5876> <t5877>How they could fall for each other, by what attraction Robert could be drawn to marry a girl with a beauty he had never praised - a girl who was still engaged to his brother and the reason his brother was cast out of the family - all of this was beyond her comprehension.</t5877> <t5878>To her heart, it was an intriguing marriage; to her imagination, it was bizarre; but to her reason, her judgment, it was entirely incomprehensible.</t5878>
<t5879>Edward could not attempt to explain by guessing that, perhaps when they first met by chance, one person's penchant for flattery had strongly influenced the other's vanity, gradually leading to the subsequent events.</t5879> <t5880>Elinor recalled what Robert had said to her on Harley Street, his opinion on what his reconciliation efforts could achieve if carried out in time.</t5880> <t5881>She recounted it to Edward.</t5881>
<t5882>He immediately commented:</t5882>
<t5883>- Robert is indeed like that, and that might have been on his mind when they first got to know each other.</t5883> <t5884>And perhaps Lucy initially only thought of asking him for help to make things easier for him.</t5884> <t5885>Plans might have formed later on.</t5885>
<t5886>However, he was as confused as she was because he didn't know how long they had known each other: in Oxford, where he had been living since he left London, he had no way of hearing news about her except through her, and her letters until the last moment were still regular, still full of affection as usual.</t5886> <t5887>Therefore, he had no suspicion to prepare for what was to happen next.</t5887> <t5888>When this matter erupted, he learned through a letter from Lucy.</t5888> <t5889>For a while, he was almost paralyzed between anxiety, horror, and the joy that the letter brought.</t5889> <t5890>He placed the letter into Elinor's hand.</t5890>
<t5891>Dear Sir, Knowing clearly that I have long lost your affection, I have thought about the freedom to bestow my affection upon someone else, and without doubt, I would be happy with this person, just as I once thought I would be happy with you; but I despise accepting a hand when the heart belongs to another.</t5891>
<t5892>Sincerely wishing you happiness in your choice, and it will not be my fault if we are no longer good friends, given the close relationship we have now.</t5892> <t5893>I can honestly say I bear no ill will towards you, and I believe you are generous enough not to do anything wrong to us.</t5893>
<t5894>Your brother has completely captured my heart, and since we cannot live without each other, we have just celebrated our wedding, and we are currently on our way to Dawlish for a few weeks, a place your dear brother is very curious to visit, but I thought I would trouble you first with a few lines.</t5894>
<t5895>Always the one wishing you well, my friend, and sister-in-law.</t5895>
<t5896>LUCY FERRARS</t5896>
<t5897>I have burned all your letters, and will return your painting at the first opportunity.</t5897> <t5898>Please destroy the sketches, but you are allowed to keep the ring with my lock of hair.</t5898>
<t5899>Elinor returned the letter to him without saying a word.</t5899>
<t5900>Edward said:</t5900>
<t5901>- I will not ask for your opinion on the letter in the manner of critiquing an essay.</t5901> <t5902>I will not want to let you read any of her letters written in the past.</t5902> <t5903>Words from the perspective of a sister were already harsh, let alone from the perspective of a wife!</t5903> <t5904>How ashamed I was through the pages of her writing! And I can say that from the first year of... of the foolish affair, this is the first letter I received from her where the content compensates for the lack of style.</t5904>
<t5905>After a while, Elinor said:</t5905>
<t5906>- No matter how things turned out, the two were certain to marry each other.</t5906> <t5907>And his mother had brought upon herself the most fitting punishment.</t5907> <t5908>Due to her dissatisfaction with him, the freedom she arranged for Robert allowed him to be in a position to make a choice; and she had bribed one son with a thousand a year to carry out the very act she had forbidden the other son, thereby disinheriting him.</t5908>
<t5909>- She will be hurt more because of that, because she always loved Robert the most.</t5909> <t5910>Because she is hurt more, by the same principle, she will forgive him much faster.</t5910>
<t5911>Edward did not know the current situation of the two people, as he had not contacted anyone in the family.</t5911> <t5912>He left Oxford within twenty-four hours after receiving Lucy's letter, with only one goal in mind: the shortest route to Barton.</t5912> <t5913>He could do nothing until he was certain about his fate with Miss Dashwood; and while he hurried to seek this fate, even though he was a little jealous of Colonel Brandon at times, even though he modestly assessed himself, and politely spoke of his doubts, in general, he did not worry that he would be received harshly.</t5913> <t5914>However, he felt he had to say he was anxious, and he expressed it very well.</t5914> <t5915>What he said about this matter twelve months later should be left to the imagination of married couples.</t5915>
<t5916>Elinor clearly saw that Lucy intended to deceive when she maliciously waved her hand at him in the message through Thomas; and now that Edward had clearly seen her character, he did not hesitate to believe that she was capable of the most despicable act.</t5916> <t5917>Although his eyes had been opened for a long time - even before he knew Elinor - to her ignorance and some narrow-minded thoughts; he had always believed she was friendly, kind, and completely devoted to him.</t5917> <t5918>Except for this belief, nothing could have prevented him from ending the engagement which had long been a source of anxiety and regret for him.</t5918>
<t5919>He said:</t5919>
<t5920>- It is not about his feelings, but he thought he had an obligation to give her the option to continue the engagement or not, when his mother had disowned him and no friends could help him.</t5920> <t5921>In a situation where there seemed to be nothing to entice anyone's greed or vanity, while she determined most earnestly, most passionately to share his fate no matter what it was, how could he think that anything - except for selfless affection without any intention of exploitation - could encourage her?</t5921> <t5922>And even now, he could not understand what her motivation was, or what imagined benefit there could be for her, to be bound to a man she did not love, with only two thousand pounds.</t5922> <t5923>At that time, she could not have foreseen that Colonel Brandon would offer him the position of clergyman.</t5923>
<t5924>- You are right; but she might think that something favorable will happen for you, that your family might concede in time.</t5924> <t5925>Anyway, if she continues the engagement, she has nothing to lose, because she has shown that this does not bind her emotions or actions.</t5925> <t5926>The relationship with you is certainly respected, perhaps it will help her gain standing among her friends; and if she doesn't see any benefits, marrying you is still better than being alone.</t5926>
<t5927>Of course, Edward immediately believed that Lucy's demeanor was entirely natural, and her motives were very clear.</t5927>
<t5928>Elinor reproached him, as severely as women always reproach the lack of caution that is often their own nature, for having spent so much time with them at Norland, when he must have clearly felt his own inconsistency.</t5928> <t5929>She said:</t5929>
<t5930>- Your behavior is clearly wrong because - not to mention that I am certain - all relations between us have been led by this behavior to delusions and expectations of things that will never come, given your situation at that time.</t5930>
<t5931>I can only confess that I did not examine my own heart, and I mistakenly trusted the strength of my own promises.</t5931>
<t5932>- I was too simple-minded to think that my fidelity, which had been promised to another, posed no danger when I was near you; and that my sense of commitment would keep my heart as safe and sacred as my honor.</t5932> <t5933>I thought I liked you, but I told myself it was just friendship, and until I began to compare you with Lucy, I didn't realize how far I had gone.</t5933> <t5934>I think, afterwards, I was wrong to stay in Sussex for so long, and the reasoning I gave myself was this: 'The danger is mine; I am only hurting myself and not harming anyone else.'</t5934>
<t5935>Elinor smiled and shook her head.</t5935>
<t5936>Edward was delighted to learn that the family was expecting Colonel Brandon, as he sincerely wished not only to get to know him better but also to have the opportunity to let him know that he no longer resented him for giving him the clerical position at Delaford. He said:</t5936>
<t5937>- Right now, after you reluctantly thanked him, he must think you will never forgive him for offering you this position.</t5937>
<t5938>Now he was surprised that he had never stopped by that place.</t5938> <t5939>Because he had not paid attention to this matter before, now he had to learn from Elinor about the house, the garden and the common land, the parish boundaries, the condition of the land, and the church tax rates that Elinor had heard much about from Colonel Brandon, and listened to with particular attention, as if she were the mistress of the subject.</t5939>
<t5940>A lingering issue between the two; just one difficulty to overcome.</t5940> <t5941>They had come together through mutual love, with the warmest acceptance from true friends; the two had a close empathy to bring about lasting happiness - and they just needed something to rely on to live.</t5941> <t5942>Edward had two thousand pounds and Elinor one thousand, plus the clerical income, which was all they could call their own; for Mrs. Dashwood could not contribute anything.</t5942> <t5943>The two did not love each other to the extent of thinking that an income of three hundred and fifty pounds a year would be enough for a comfortable life.</t5943>
<t5944>Edward still hoped that his mother would change her mind in a way that would be favorable to him, and he hoped this would provide the remaining income he lacked.</t5944> <t5945>But Elinor did not dare to hope: Edward still could not marry Miss Morton, and his choice of her had been spoken of in such arrogant terms as a misfortune only slightly less than choosing Lucy Steele, so she feared that Robert's wrongdoing served no other purpose than to enrich Fanny.</t5945>
<t5946>Four days after Edward arrived, Colonel Brandon appeared to complete Mrs. Dashwood's satisfaction; also giving her additional prestige as, for the first time since arriving at Barton, she had more guests than the house could accommodate.</t5946> <t5947>Edward was allowed to keep the privilege of being the first to arrive, and thus each night Colonel Brandon had to go sleep at Barton Park, then return every morning, early enough to intrude on the lovers' tête-à-tête before breakfast.</t5947>
<t5948>After three weeks at Delaford, at least during the evening hours, he did not have much to do except calculate the imbalance between thirty-six and seventeen; then he went to Barton with the determination to require every improvement in Marianne's thoughts, every kindness in her reception, and every encouragement from her mother's words, to be satisfied.</t5948> <t5949>However, among such friends and such contentment, he truly revived.</t5949> <t5950>The news of Lucy's wedding had not yet reached him; he knew nothing of what had happened, so the first hours were spent listening and wondering.</t5950> <t5951>Mrs. Dashwood explained everything to him, and he found new reason to be pleased with what he had done for Mr. Ferrars, as this ultimately strengthened Elinor's interest.</t5951>
<t5952>The two men advanced in their good feelings for each other as they progressed in their relationship.</t5952> <t5953>The two had similarities in principles and perceptions, in temperament and way of thinking, which might have been enough to bond them in friendship without any other attraction.</t5953> <t5954>But through their love for the two sisters, and the sisters' love for each other, the mutual affection between the two men blossomed quickly and naturally, otherwise they would have had to wait for the effects of time and judgment.</t5954>
<t5955>The letters from the city, which a few days ago could have made every nerve in Elinor's body tremble, were now opened and read with only a slight disturbance.</t5955> <t5956>Mrs. Jennings told a wonderful story to vent her genuine disdain for the unfaithful girl and to pour her sympathy onto poor Edward, whom she firmly believed was madly in love with the shameless girl and, according to all sources, was suffering from heartbreak in Oxford.</t5956>
<t5957>She continued writing:</t5957>
<t5958>I think there has never been an affair conducted so cunningly, because just two days before, Lucy came to visit and sat with me for several hours.</t5958> <t5959>No one suspected anything, not even Nancy, who, poor thing!</t5959> <t5960>Came crying to me the next day, in utter panic for fear of Mrs. Ferrars, not knowing how to get to Plymouth; because it seemed that Lucy had borrowed all her sister's money before leaving for the wedding, with what I think was a showy purpose, and poor Nancy didn't have a penny left; - so I was happy to give Nancy five guineas so she could go to Exeter, to seek the Doctor once more.</t5960> <t5961>And I must say that Lucy's unkind act of not allowing her sister to join the two of them in the carriage was the worst thing.</t5961>
<t5962>Poor Edward!</t5962> <t5963>I can't get him out of my mind, but he should be invited to Barton, and Marianne must try to comfort him.</t5963>
<t5964>The tension of Mr. Daswood was more solemn.</t5964> <t5965>Mrs. Ferrars was the most unfortunate woman; poor Fanny had gone through sorrow due to her feelings; and he thought about the existence of each person, under such a blow, with amazement.</t5965> <t5966>Robert's fault could be forgiven, but Lucy's sin was extremely severe.</t5966> <t5967>No one was to mention the two in front of Mrs. Ferrars; and even if later she could be persuaded to forgive her son, his wife would never be acknowledged as her daughter-in-law, nor be allowed to appear in her presence.</t5967> <t5968>The veil of secrecy that the two had cast to expedite everything was seen as a factor that aggravated their crime, because if there had been anything to make others suspicious, measures would have been taken to prevent the marriage; and he urged Elinor to join him in expressing regret that the engagement between Lucy and Edward did not materialize, so that she would not have the opportunity to spread the misery further within the family.</t5968>
<t5969>He continued writing:</t5969>
<t5970>Mrs. Ferrars never mentioned Edward's name, and this did not surprise us, but we were utterly astonished not to receive a word from him on this occasion.</t5970> <t5971>However, perhaps he kept silent for fear of causing offense, so I will give him a hint through a letter sent to Oxford, that his sister and I think a properly respectful letter from him, perhaps sent to Fanny, and through her conveyed to her mother, would be timely; for both of us understand Mrs. Ferrars' gentle heart, and she desires nothing more than harmony with her children.</t5971>
<t5972>This letter is of great importance for Edward's future and character.</t5972> <t5973>It advises him to try to reconcile, although not necessarily in the way his brother-in-law and sister have outlined.</t5973>
<t5974>He repeated:</t5974>
<t5975>- A properly obedient letter!</t5975> <t5976>Do they want him to beg his mother for forgiveness for Robert's ingratitude towards her, and for the insult to his own honor?</t5976> <t5977>He could not obey.</t5977> <t5978>He had neither lost face nor felt remorse for what had happened.</t5978> <t5979>He had become very happy, but this was unrelated.</t5979> <t5980>He did not know how to properly obey.</t5980>
<t5981>Elinor said:</t5981>
<t5982>- Surely you can ask for forgiveness for having offended; and I think now you can go a bit further to say you're sorry for having had an engagement that made your mother angry. You agree you can do that.</t5982>
<t5983>- And when she has forgiven you, perhaps a little humility would also be good in admitting that the second engagement, in her eyes, was almost as reckless as the first.</t5983>
<t5984>He had no objection to this matter, but he still opposed the idea of a submissive letter.</t5984> <t5985>And since he had expressed his willingness to concede through a verbal message rather than in writing, to make it easier for him, they agreed that instead of writing a letter to Fanny, he would go to London and plead with her in person.</t5985>
<t5986>Marianne said:</t5986>
<t5987>- And if they truly want to be involved in the reconciliation process, I think even John and Fanny are not completely devoid of dignity.</t5987>
<t5988>Three or four days after Colonel Brandon arrived, the two men left Barton together.</t5988> <t5989>They went to Delaford together so that Edward could learn more about his future home and decide what renovations were needed.</t5989> <t5990>From there, after a few days, he would go to the city.</t5990>
<t5991>Chapter 50 (Conclusion)</t5991>
<t5992>After Mrs. Ferrars expressed her opposition properly, as strongly and firmly as if she wanted to avoid the criticism she always feared would happen - being criticized for being too kind, Edward was allowed to meet her and was declared her son once again.</t5992>
<t5993>S</t5993>
<t5994>The family of the lady has recently endured many hardships.</t5994> <t5995>For many years of her life, she had two sons; but the sin and destruction of Edward a few weeks ago took one son away; the similar destruction of Robert left her with no sons within two weeks; and now, through Edward's recovery, she has one son again.</t5995>
<t5996>However, even though he was allowed to live once more, he did not feel his existence was assured until he revealed his current engagement; because he feared</t5996> <t5997>that disclosing this situation might reverse his standing and expel him from the family as quickly as before.</t5997> <t5998>Therefore, he disclosed it with cautious anxiety, and he was listened to with a calmness he had not anticipated.</t5998>
<t5999>At first, Mrs. Ferrars reasonably tried to advise him not to marry Miss Dashwood, using many arguments within her capacity, telling him that with Miss Morton he would have a woman of higher class and greater fortune; and reinforced this assertion by noting that Miss Morton was the daughter of a nobleman with thirty thousand pounds, while Miss Dashwood was merely the daughter of a commoner with no more than three.</t5999> <t6000>When she saw that, despite absolutely acknowledging the truth in her exposition, he still refused to be guided in that direction, from past experience, she deemed it best to acquiesce.</t6000> <t6001>Therefore, after a period of reluctant delay demanded by her dignity, and also to avoid suspicion of benevolence, she decreed her approval of Edward and Elinor's marriage.</t6001>
<t6002>What she would do to increase the income for the two of them was the next matter to consider.</t6002> <t6003>Here, it seemed that although Edward was now her only son, he was still not the eldest son.</t6003> <t6004>While Robert inevitably enjoyed an income of one thousand pounds a year, there was no opposition to Edward's ordination to receive at most two hundred and fifty, and there was no promise for the present or future beyond the ten thousand pounds provided with Fanny.</t6004>
<t6005>However, this was the amount they had wished for and more than what Edward and Elinor had expected.</t6005> <t6006>Through her vague excuses, it seemed that Mrs. Ferrars was the only one surprised that she had not given more.</t6006>
<t6007>With a relatively sufficient income to ensure the needs of both individuals, there was no need to wait until the clerical position was received, except for the house to be ready.</t6007> <t6008>Through his eager desire to welcome Elinor, Colonel Brandon significantly upgraded the house; and it took some time to complete, after, as usual, experiencing the disappointments and delays caused by the inexplicable sluggishness of the workers.</t6008> <t6009>As was customary, Elinor abandoned her initial resolve not to marry until everything was ready.</t6009> <t6010>The wedding was held at Barton Church in early autumn.</t6010> <t6011>In the first month after the wedding, the couple stayed with their friend at the mansion to oversee the upgrades to the Parsonage and to direct everything on-site according to their preferences, choosing materials, arranging the landscape, and cleaning up.</t6011>
<t6012>Although mixed up and jumbled together, Mrs. Jennings' prophecies mostly came true.</t6012> <t6013>During the Feast of Saint Michael, she was able to visit Edward and his wife at the Parsonage, and she found that Elinor and her husband were one of the happiest couples in the world, just as she had firmly believed.</t6013> <t6014>Indeed, they had nothing left to wish for, except for the marriage between Colonel Brandon and Marianne, and better pastures for the cattle.</t6014>
<t6015>Almost all the acquaintances came to visit the couple.</t6015> <t6016>Mrs. Ferrars came to inspect the happy life she almost felt ashamed to have approved, and even Mr. and Mrs. Daswood went to the expense of coming from Sussex to honor them.</t6016>
<t6017>When taking a walk together one morning in front of Delaford House, John said:</t6017>
<t6018>- Dear sister, I don't want to say that I'm disappointed, that would be saying too much, because you are certainly one of the luckiest women in the world.</t6018> <t6019>But, I must confess, I am very happy to call Colonel Brandon my brother-in-law.</t6019> <t6020>His estate here, his property, his house, everything is in a most respectable and wonderful condition!</t6020> <t6021>And his forest too! In Dorsetshire, I have never seen wood like that in Delaford Forest!</t6021>
<t6022>"And although Marianne might not exactly be the type to attract him, in general, I still think it's better for you to frequently invite the two of them to stay with you, because although Colonel Brandon seems to often stay at home, no one can say what might happen...</t6022> <t6023>Because, when people are too close to each other and see little of anyone else...</t6023> <t6024>And you will always have the ability to make her stand out, something like that; in short, you can give her a chance.</t6024> <t6025>You understand me."</t6025>
<t6026>However, although Mrs. Ferrars came to meet them and always pretended to show proper affection for the two, they never felt humiliated by her genuine fondness and favoritism.</t6026> <t6027>It was due to the foolishness of Robert and his cunning wife; and these two had to wait for many months to pass.</t6027> <t6028>Her selfish sharpness, which initially led Robert into a difficult situation, was the main tool to free him from this predicament.</t6028> <t6029>The respectful concessions, the diligent attentions, and the continuous flattery used whenever the opportunity arose, all helped to reconcile Mrs. Ferrars with the person he chose, restoring him fully in her affection.</t6029>
<t6030>Now, the entire behavior of Lucy can be presented.</t6030> <t6031>This is an encouraging example of what long-term, fervent self-interest can accomplish to seize all the advantages of wealth, while sacrificing nothing but time and conscience.</t6031>
<t6032>When Robert first came to get acquainted with her and secretly visited her at the Barlett Building, his only purpose was to persuade her to give up the engagement.</t6032> <t6033>Since he saw no other issues to overcome except for their romantic relationship, it was natural for him to think that one or two conversations would be enough to settle the matter.</t6033>
<t6034>However, at this point and only at this point, he was mistaken.</t6034> <t6035>Although Lucy soon gave him hope that with time his lively personality might persuade her, in reality, another visit was needed, another conversation was necessary to achieve this persuasion.</t6035> <t6036>When he bid farewell, there was always a lingering doubt in her mind, which could only be dispelled by another half-hour conversation.</t6036> <t6037>Thus ensuring he had to visit frequently, and what remained continued to unfold.</t6037> <t6038>Instead of talking about Edward, gradually they only talked about Robert - a topic he had much more to say about than any other, and soon she showed interest that was even equal to his.</t6038>
<t6039>In short, the two quickly realized that he had taken his brother's place.</t6039> <t6040>He was proud of his conquest, proud of having deceived Edward, and very proud of having secretly married without his mother's consent.</t6040> <t6041>They spent many months in utmost happiness in Dawlish, as she had many acquaintances to sever ties with, and he was busy drawing plans for some splendid holiday homes.</t6041> <t6042>Then from there, he returned to the city, forgiven by Mrs. Ferrars, simply by asking for forgiveness, under Lucy's instigation.</t6042> <t6043>Indeed, at first, the forgiveness was reasonable as it was only granted to Robert, while Lucy had no obligations to her, thus had not violated anything, so she had to wait several more weeks to be forgiven.</t6043>
<t6044>However, she persistently showed humility in her demeanor and speech to self-condemn herself for Robert's sins and to express gratitude for her mistreatment.</t6044> <t6045>This gave rise to an arrogant concern to surpass herself through kindness, so in a short time, she won affection and exerted influence to the highest degree.</t6045> <t6046>Like Robert or Fanny, Lucy became indispensable to Mrs. Ferrars.</t6046> <t6047>While Edward was never lovingly forgiven for the past sin of intending to marry her, and Elinor was spoken of as an outsider despite her superior wealth and family background; all things considered, Lucy was the one who won the family's affection more and was publicly acknowledged as such.</t6047>
<t6048>The couple settled in the city, receiving extensive support from Mrs. Ferrars, and maintained a good relationship with the Daswood couple in an imaginable intimacy.</t6048> <t6049>They also set aside the jealousy and malice that always existed between Fanny and Lucy, in which their husbands were partly involved.</t6049> <t6050>Similarly, the internal disagreements between Robert and Lucy never exceeded the limits of the harmonious atmosphere in which they lived together.</t6050>
<t6051>Many people would surely find it difficult to understand what Edward did after losing the rights of the eldest son and what Robert did after inheriting these rights.</t6051> <t6052>However, this is a settlement that appears reasonable in its consequences, if not in its causes.</t6052> <t6053>In Robert's way of life or words, there is nothing to indicate that he regrets his level of income, having left so little for his brother and taken so much for himself.</t6053> <t6054>As for Edward, considering his fulfillment of duties in all areas, his increasing attachment to his wife and home, and his cheerful demeanor, it can be seen that he is no less content and no less free in all his desires for change.</t6054>
<t6055>After marriage, Elinor was not entirely separated from her family, so the Barton cottage did not become completely useless, as she spent more than half of her time with her mother and sister.</t6055>
<t6056>Mrs. Dashwood now acted on the impulse of principle as well as pleasure through her frequent visits to Delaford; for her desire to bring Marianne and Colonel Brandon together was more earnest and generous than John had imagined.</t6056> <t6057>That was her dear objective at present.</t6057> <t6058>Although she longed to be as close to her daughter as possible, she did not wish to monopolize her affection to the exclusion of her dear friend.</t6058> <t6059>As for Edward and Elinor, they also wished to see Marianne settled in the mansion, for each felt the sufferings of the gentleman and their own personal gratitude; and Marianne was the reward for all these sufferings and gratitude.</t6059>
<t6060>With such an alliance against her, with such a deep understanding of his good nature, with the belief in his feelings for her, which finally, after a long time, everyone could clearly see - what could she possibly do?</t6060>
<t6061>Marianne Daswood was born into an extraordinary fate.</t6061> <t6062>She was born to discover that her notions were misguided, and to go against the principles she held most dear.</t6062> <t6063>She was born to overcome a blossoming love at the age of seventeen with no higher emotion than intense and vivid affection, and then willingly give her life to another!</t6063> <t6064>And this other person, who suffered no less than she did through the first love, whom she considered too old two years ago, is the one who still finds warmth in a flannel coat!</t6064>
<t6065>But that's how it is.</t6065> <t6066>Instead of sacrificing for an irresistible passion - as she once complacently hoped for, instead of staying with her mother for life and finding joy in rest and study - as she later resolved in more calm and sober reflection, at the age of nineteen she submitted to new entanglements, took on new obligations, was placed in a new home, as a wife, as the mistress of a household, and as the patroness of a village.</t6066>
<t6067>Colonel Brandon is now a happy man, just as those who love him most believe he deserves to be.</t6067> <t6068>Through Marianne, he found solace for all the sorrows of the past.</t6068> <t6069>Her affection and that of her acquaintances revived his spirits and restored his mental vitality.</t6069> <t6070>Marianne's pursuit of her own happiness by making him happy also brought joy and contentment to all their relatives who witnessed their union.</t6070> <t6071>Marianne could never love half-heartedly; her feelings were wholly devoted to her husband, just as they had once been wholly devoted to Willoughby.</t6071>
<t6072>Willoughby could not hear of her marriage without a pang.</t6072> <t6073>Soon enough, his punishment became complete when Mrs. Smith voluntarily forgave him.</t6073> <t6074>Her attitude gave him reason to believe that, had he treated Marianne honorably, he might have immediately become both wealthy and happy.</t6074> <t6075>There is no doubt that he sincerely repented for his wrongdoings, or that he thought of Colonel Brandon with jealousy and of Marianne with regret.</t6075>
<t6076>But one should not believe that he was so miserable that nothing could console him - that he withdrew from society, or became chronically melancholic, or sought death due to heartbreak - because these things did not happen.</t6076> <t6077>He still lived to lift himself up, and often to seek pleasure.</t6077> <t6078>His wife was not always solemn, his home was not always lacking in comfort; and through his horses and dogs, through various sports, he found considerable family happiness.</t6078>
<t6079>However, for Marianne - even though he had a rude attitude and continued to live after losing her - he always maintained his feelings, cared about everything that happened to her, and used her as his secret standard of a perfect woman; and later, other rising beauties were scorned by him because they could not compare to Mrs. Brandon.</t6079>
<t6080>Mrs. Dashwood was cautious enough to stay at the cottage, not wanting to move to Delaford. It was fortunate for Sir John and Mrs. Jennings that, with Marianne having left them, Margaret had just reached the age perfectly suitable for attending balls, and was also very suitable for the two adults to tease about her suitors.</t6080>
<t6081>Between Barton and Delaford, there was always a frequent connection due to the deep family love.</t6081> <t6082>Among the qualities and happiness of Elinor and Marianne, one should not consider it insignificant: despite being sisters and living close to each other, they could live without any disagreement between the two, and without causing any estrangement between the two brothers-in-law.</t6082>
