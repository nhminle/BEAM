<t0>First Chapter</t0>
<t1>Mr. Jones, the owner of Manor Farm, had closed the henhouse door as he did every night, but because he was very drunk, he had forgotten to close the holes through which the chickens went in and out.</t1> <t2>As he stumbled and staggered across the yard, the light from the lantern in his hand was swaying this way and that.</t2> <t3>At the back door, he took off his boots and threw them aside, filled one last glass of beer from the barrel in the pantry and drank it in one gulp, then went upstairs to his bedroom.</t3> <t4>Mrs. Jones was snoring loudly.</t4>
<t5>As soon as the light in the bedroom went out, a commotion and a rush began in all the buildings of the farm.</t5> <t6>It had been announced during the day: Old Major, the boar who had once won a prize, wanted to tell all the animals about a strange dream he had the night before.</t6> <t7>As soon as Mr. Jones was out of the way, it was decided that everyone would gather in the big barn.</t7> <t8>Old Major (he had entered the competition under the name Willingdon Beauty, but everyone called him Old Major) was so highly respected on the farm that everyone was willing to lose sleep to hear what he had to say.</t8>
<t9>The leader had already settled on a straw mattress laid on a platform illuminated by a lantern hanging from one of the beams in the ceiling, in a corner of the large barn.</t9> <t10>He was twelve years old, had recently put on a bit of weight; despite his long, sharp canine teeth never having been cut, he was an imposing pig who looked wise and fatherly.</t10> <t11>Soon, the other animals also began to arrive one after another and started to take their places in an orderly manner.</t11> <t12>First appeared three dogs named Bluebell, Jessie, and Pincher; then the pigs came and settled on the straw right in front of the platform.</t12> <t13>The hens perched on the window sills, the pigeons settled on the roof beams, and the sheep and cows lay down behind the pigs and began to chew cud.</t13> <t14>Two cart horses named Boxer and Clover entered together; they walked slowly, carefully placing their large, hairy feet on the ground, worried that there might be a small animal among the straw that they couldn't see.</t14> <t15>Clover was a large, motherly mare who could be considered middle-aged; she had never quite regained her former shape after giving birth to her fourth foal.</t15> <t16>Boxer, on the other hand, was a very large animal, nearly two meters tall, with the strength of two horses.</t16> <t17>A white stripe down his forehead to his nose made him look somewhat stupid; indeed, he was not considered the smartest animal on the farm, but he had earned everyone's respect with his solid character and astonishing work ethic.</t17> <t18>After the horses, a white goat named Muriel and a donkey named Benjamin appeared.</t18> <t19>Benjamin was the oldest and most cantankerous animal on the farm.</t19> <t20>It couldn't be said that honey dripped from his mouth, but he spoke little and to the point: "God gave me a tail to shoo away flies; but I wish there were no flies and no tail either."</t20> <t21>He was the only animal on the farm who never laughed.</t21> <t22>To those who asked why he didn't laugh, he would reply, "What's there to laugh at?"</t22> <t23>But despite not showing it openly, he admired Boxer; the two of them would spend their Sundays together, usually grazing side by side in silence in the meadow behind the orchard.</t23>
<t24>Just as the two horses had lain down, the orphaned ducklings, chirping loudly, entered the barn in a single file; waddling around, they were looking for a place where they wouldn't get trampled.</t24> <t25>Clover built a wall around the ducklings with her large foreleg; they huddled there and immediately fell asleep.</t25> <t26>At the last moment, Mollie, the white mare with long hair but short on brains, who pulled Mr. Jones's two-wheeled cart, arrived; with a lump of sugar in her mouth, she gracefully entered.</t26> <t27>She chose a spot at the front; hoping to draw attention, she began to sway her white mane, braided with red ribbons, from side to side.</t27> <t28>Finally, the cat appeared; true to its nature, it immediately began to look for the warmest spot and eventually nestled between Boxer and Clover; it purred contentedly throughout Old Major's speech â€“without listening to a single word he said.</t28>
<t29>Except for the pet raven Moses, who was sleeping on the perch near the back door, all the animals had arrived.</t29> <t30>The leader, seeing that everyone had taken their place and was waiting in silence, cleared his throat and began to speak:</t30>
<t31>"Comrades, you all know that I had a strange dream last night.</t31> <t32>I will come to the dream later.</t32> <t33>I want to tell you something else first.</t33> <t34>Comrades, I don't think I have much time left.</t34> <t35>Therefore, I consider it my duty to pass on to you the knowledge and experiences I have gained so far.</t35> <t36>I have lived a long life, and while lying alone in my stall, I had much time to think; I can say that I have understood the order of this world as much as any living animal.</t36> <t37>What I want to talk to you about today is precisely this.</t37>
<t38>"Yes comrades, what kind of life are we living?</t38> <t39>Let's not be afraid to say it openly: Our short lives pass by in poverty, struggling and toiling from morning till night.</t39> <t40>After coming into the world, they give us just enough food to survive; they make those of us who remain standing work until we drop; and when we become useless to them, they slaughter us with terrible cruelty.</t40> <t41>In England, after reaching one year of age, no animal knows what happiness is, no animal can rest or have fun.</t41> <t42>In England, no animal is free.</t42> <t43>What is our life but misery and slavery!</t43> <t44>This, in all its starkness, is the truth.</t44>
<t45>"So, is this situation a law of Nature?</t45> <t46>Is our country so poor that it cannot offer a decent life to those living on its land?</t46> <t47>No, comrades, never! The lands of England are fertile; the air and water of our homeland are good; today, it can provide plenty of food for many more animals than those living in this country.</t47> <t48>Even just our farm alone can feed a dozen horses, twenty cows, hundreds of sheep; not just feed, but can give them a life of comfort and dignity that we cannot even dream of today.</t48> <t49>So, why should we submit to this misery?</t49> <t50>Humans are stealing almost all of what we produce with our labor.</t50> <t51>Here, comrades, the answer to all our problems lies here.</t51> <t52>It can be summarized in a single word: Man.</t52> <t53>Our only real enemy is Man.</t53> <t54>Remove Man, and the root cause of hunger and overwork will be abolished forever from the earth.</t54>
<t55>"Man is the only creature that consumes without producing.</t55> <t56>He does not give milk, he does not lay eggs, he is not strong enough to pull the plow, he cannot run fast enough to catch a rabbit.</t56> <t57>Yet, he is the lord of all the animals.</t57> <t58>He sets them to work, he gives them just enough food to keep them from starving, and the rest he keeps for himself.</t58> <t59>We plow the fields with our labor, we enrich the soil with our manure; yet none of us has anything except our bare skin.</t59> <t60>You, cows sitting before me; how many thousands of liters of milk did you give this year?</t60> <t61>Where did the milk that was necessary to raise sturdy calves go?</t61> <t62>Every drop of it has gone down the throats of our enemies.</t62> <t63>You, hens; how many eggs did you lay this year, how many of those eggs hatched into chicks?</t63> <t64>Almost all of them were sold at the market, bringing money to Jones and his men.</t64> <t65>And you, Clover, where are those four foals you bore; where are those foals you would lean on and enjoy when you grow old?</t65> <t66>All four were sold when they reached a year old; you will never see them again.</t66> <t67>What did you get in return for those four foals you gave to the humans and your labor in the fields, other than a handful of feed and a cold barn?</t67>
<t68>"Moreover, they don't even allow this wretched life we live to reach its natural end.</t68> <t69>I'm considered lucky, so I'm not complaining too much.</t69> <t70>I'm twelve years old, and I've had more than four hundred children.</t70> <t71>Quite natural for a pig.</t71> <t72>But no animal can escape that cruel knife in the end.</t72> <t73>You, young pigs sitting in front of me; within a year, you'll die squealing under the knife.</t73> <t74>Cows, pigs, chickens, sheep; this horrible end awaits all of us, all of us.</t74> <t75>The fate of horses and dogs is not much different from ours.</t75> <t76>You, Boxer, as soon as those big muscles of yours lose their strength, Jones will sell you to the butcher who buys crippled and old horses.</t76> <t77>The butcher will slit your throat, boil you in a pot, and make dog food out of you.</t77> <t78>As for the dogs; once they grow old and lose their teeth, Jones ties a stone around their necks and throws them into the nearest lake.</t78>
<t79>"So then, comrades, isn't it as clear as day that all the evils that befall us in this life stem from human tyranny?</t79> <t80>Let's get rid of Mankind, and the fruits of our labor will be ours.</t80> <t81>Only then will we be rich and free.</t81> <t82>So, what should we do?</t82> <t83>Day and night, with all our might, we must strive to overthrow the human race!</t83> <t84>So, I tell you comrades: Rise up! I don't know when this Uprising will happen, it could be in a week, it could be in a hundred years; but as surely as I see the straw beneath my feet, I see that justice will eventually prevail.</t84> <t85>Comrades, in this short life of yours, do not forget this!</t85>
<t86>And most importantly, pass on this advice to those who come after you, so that future generations may fight until victory.</t86>
<t87>"And comrades, your determination must never, but never waver.</t87> <t88>No argument should divert you from your path.</t88> <t89>There may be those who say that humans and animals have a common interest, that the well-being of one is the well-being of the others.</t89> <t90>Do not listen to them.</t90> <t91>It is all lies.</t91> <t92>Mankind does not consider the interests of any creature other than itself.</t92> <t93>In this struggle, establish complete unity among animals, ensure perfect comradeship.</t93> <t94>All humans are enemies!</t94> <t95>All animals are comrades!</t95><t96>"</t96>
<t97>At that moment, a tremendous noise erupted.</t97> <t98>While Koca Reis was speaking, four large rats that had slipped out of their holes sat on their hind legs and began listening to him.</t98> <t99>The dogs, as soon as they saw them, launched an attack; the rats quickly escaped into their holes, barely saving their lives.</t99> <t100>Reis raised his front paw and silenced everyone:</t100>
<t101>"Comrades.</t101> <t102>We have a problem to solve.</t102> <t103>Are wild animals like rats and rabbits our friends or our enemies?</t103> <t104>Let's put it to a vote.</t104> <t105>I ask this question: Are rats our comrades?</t105><t106>"</t106>
<t107>The vote was taken immediately; it was decided by a very large majority that the rats were comrades.</t107> <t108>Only four votes were against, and they came from three dogs and a cat.</t108>
<t109>Later, it was understood that the cat had voted both yes and no.</t109> <t110>The Big Chief continued his speech:</t110>
<t111>"I am not going to say anything more.</t111> <t112>There is only one point I want to repeat: Never forget that it is your duty to act hostile towards Man and all the misfortunes that come from him.</t112> <t113>Two-legged creatures are our enemies.</t113> <t114>Four-legged creatures and winged creatures are our friends.</t114> <t115>Also, remember that while fighting against Man, we must not end up resembling him.</t115> <t116>Even when you have defeated him, do not try to adopt his bad habits.</t116> <t117>No animal should ever live in a house, sleep in a bed, wear clothes, drink alcohol, smoke, touch money, or engage in trade.</t117> <t118>All of Man's habits are evil.</t118> <t119>And most importantly, no animal should ever tyrannize over its own kind.</t119> <t120>The strong, the weak, the intelligent, the foolish, we are all brothers.</t120> <t121>No animal should kill another animal.</t121> <t122>All animals are equal.</t122>
<t123>"Comrades, I can now speak about the dream I had last night.</t123> <t124>I cannot describe it exactly, but I can say that I saw what the world would be like after Man has vanished.</t124> <t125>I remembered something I had long forgotten.</t125> <t126>Years ago, when I was a little pig, my mother and the other sows used to sing an old song of which they only knew the tune and the first three words.</t126> <t127>I had learned the tune as a child, but it had long since slipped my mind.</t127> <t128>Last night, in my dream, the tune of the song came back to me.</t128> <t129>Moreover, I remembered the words of the song.</t129> <t130>I have no doubt that these were the words of a song that animals sang in ancient times, forgotten for generations.</t130> <t131>Now, comrades, I will sing this song to you.</t131> <t132>I am old, my voice is hoarse, but once I teach you the tune, you can sing it much better.</t132> <t133>The name of the song is, 'Beasts of England.'</t133><t134>"</t134>
<t135>Koca Reis cleared his throat and started singing.</t135> <t136>His voice was indeed hoarse, but he wasn't singing badly at all.</t136> <t137>The song had a lively melody, something between Clementine and La Cucuracha.</t137> <t138>The lyrics were as follows:</t138>
<t139>The animals of England and Ireland,</t139>
<t140>Animals of all countries, of all climates,</t140>
<t141>Listen to the most beautiful of the good news,</t141>
<t142>The Golden Age we dreamed of is ahead of us.</t142>
<t143>Eventually, a day will come,</t143>
<t144>The Tyrant Human will be overthrown,</t144>
<t145>In the fertile lands of England</t145>
<t146>Only animals will roam.</t146>
<t147>The rings passed through our noses,</t147>
<t148>The saddle strapped to our backs will be removed and thrown away,</t148>
<t149>The spur stuck in our belly will rot and rust,</t149>
<t150>The merciless whip will crack no more.</t150>
<t151>Riches will not fit into dreams,</t151>
<t152>Its wheat, its barley, its oats, its straw,</t152>
<t153>Clover, broad beans, beetroot,</t153>
<t154>That day, everything will be ours.</t154>
<t155>The meadows of England are greener,</t155>
<t156>The rivers will be brighter,</t156>
<t157>The winds will blow more sweetly,</t157>
<t158>When we attain our freedom.</t158>
<t159>Even if we die and pass away without seeing that day,</t159>
<t160>Everyone must fight for this cause,</t160>
<t161>Cows and horses, geese and turkeys hand in hand,</t161>
<t162>One must sweat for freedom.</t162>
<t163>The animals of England and Ireland,</t163>
<t164>Animals of all countries, all climates,</t164>
<t165>Listen to my good news, spread the word everywhere,</t165>
<t166>The Golden Age we dreamed of is ahead of us.</t166>
<t167>The song had stirred a wild excitement in the hearts of the animals.</t167> <t168>Before the Leader even reached the end, they had all begun to sing together.</t168> <t169>Even the most foolish had picked up the tune and a few words of the song; those as intelligent as the pigs and dogs had memorized the entire song in a few minutes.</t169> <t170>After a few attempts, the farm echoed with the sound of "Animals of England" sung in unison.</t170> <t171>The cows were mooing, the dogs were barking, the sheep were bleating, the horses were neighing, and the ducks were quacking.</t171> <t172>They enjoyed it so much that they sang the song from beginning to end five times; if Mr. Jones hadn't woken up, they might have sung it until morning.</t172>
<t173>But unfortunately, Mr. Jones woke up from the noise; thinking a fox had entered the yard, he jumped out of bed.</t173> <t174>As he grabbed the rifle that always stood in the corner of his bedroom, he fired into the darkness.</t174> <t175>As soon as the large pellets embedded themselves in the wall of the barn, the animals at the meeting scattered like chicks.</t175> <t176>Everyone ran to where they slept.</t176> <t177>The birds jumped to their perches, and the animals lay down on their straw beds.</t177> <t178>Soon, the entire farm fell asleep.</t178>
<t179>Second Chapter</t179>
<t180>Koca Reis died peacefully in his sleep three nights later.</t180> <t181>They buried him in a spot at the edge of the orchard.</t181>
<t182>It was the early days of March when the Leader died.</t182> <t183>During the following three months, a lot of secret activities were carried out.</t183> <t184>The Leader's speech had made the smarter animals on the farm look at life with a completely new perspective.</t184> <t185>No one knew when the Rebellion he had predicted would occur; they also didn't know if they would live long enough to see such an uprising; but they could clearly see that their duty was to prepare for that day.</t185> <t186>The task of educating and organizing the others was naturally given to the pigs, who were generally considered the smartest of the animals.</t186> <t187>The most talented of the pigs were two young male pigs named Snowball and Napoleon, whom Mr. Jones had raised for sale.</t187> <t188>Napoleon was a large, fierce-looking Berkshire boar; in fact, he was the only Berkshire on the farm.</t188> <t189>He wasn't much of a talker, but he was known for getting his way by force.</t189> <t190>Snowball was a more lively, more spirited pig than Napoleon; he was also more eloquent and more inventive; but it was said that his character was not as strong as Napoleon's.</t190> <t191>All the male pigs on the farm were fattening pigs.</t191> <t192>The most famous among them was a plump pig named Squealer, with very round cheeks, constantly blinking eyes, a shrill voice, and a restless nature.</t192> <t193>He was a brilliant speaker; when discussing a difficult topic, he would jump from side to side and wag his tail rapidly; for some reason, these actions made him very persuasive.</t193> <t194>They used to say about Squealer, "He could turn black into white."</t194>
<t195>These three had developed Old Major's thoughts into a complete doctrine, which they named "Animalism."</t195> <t196>Several nights a week, after Mr. Jones had gone to sleep, they held secret meetings in the barn, explaining the principles of Animalism to the other animals.</t196> <t197>At first, they encountered great stupidity and indifference.</t197> <t198>Some animals talked about their duty of loyalty to Mr. Jones, whom they called "Master"; others said, "Mr. Jones feeds us.</t198> <t199>If it weren't for him, we would starve to death," uttering such foolish remarks.</t199> <t200>Some asked questions like, "What good will it do us after we are dead?" or "If this Rebellion is going to happen anyway, what difference does it make whether we work for it or not?"</t200> <t201>The pigs had a hard time making them understand that such talk was contrary to the spirit of Animalism.</t201> <t202>The most foolish question came from the white mare Mollie; her first question to Snowball was, "Will there still be sugar after the Rebellion?"</t202>
<t203>Snowball cut in, "No," he said.</t203> <t204>"We cannot produce sugar on this farm.</t204> <t205>Besides, sugar will not be necessary.</t205> <t206>You will be able to eat as much oats and hay as you want.</t206><t207>"</t207>
<t208>This time, Mollie had asked, "Well, will I still be able to put ribbons in my mane?"</t208>
<t209>Snowball said, "Come on, comrade."</t209> <t210>"The ribbon you can't do without is a symbol of slavery.</t210> <t211>Don't you get that freedom is worth more than ribbons?</t211><t212>"</t212>
<t213>Mollie didn't seem very convinced when she said "Kabul."</t213>
<t214>The pigs had to fight an even tougher battle to curb the lies spread by the pet raven Moses.</t214> <t215>Moses, who was Mr. Jones's favorite, was a tattler and a gossip, but he was a smooth talker.</t215> <t216>He had made up another tale: supposedly, there was a mysterious country called the Land of Sugarcandy, where all animals went when they died.</t216> <t217>According to Moses, this country was somewhere in the sky, just beyond the clouds.</t217> <t218>In the Land of Sugarcandy, every day was Sunday; clover grew in all seasons, and trees and bushes were laden with sugar lumps and linseed cakes.</t218> <t219>Although the animals hated Moses because he spent his days telling tales and never worked, there were still some who believed in the tale of the Land of Sugarcandy.</t219> <t220>The pigs talked at length to convince them that such a place did not exist.</t220>
<t221>The most loyal disciples were the two cart horses, Boxer and Clover.</t221> <t222>These two horses, who had considerable difficulty thinking for themselves, had unquestioningly adopted everything the pigs said after deeming them as teachers and conveyed it exactly to the other animals.</t222> <t223>They never missed the secret meetings in the barn; they led the singing of the "Beasts of England" song at the end of each meeting.</t223>
<t224>Then, the Rebellion happened much earlier and much more easily than anyone had expected.</t224> <t225>Although Mr. Jones was a skilled farmer, he had been treating the animals very harshly, and recently his affairs had taken a turn for the worse.</t225> <t226>Especially after losing money in a lawsuit, he had lost hope completely and had taken to drinking excessively, to the point of ruining his health.</t226> <t227>Sometimes he would sit idly for days in his kitchen armchair, reading the newspaper and drinking, occasionally feeding Moses with pieces of bread soaked in beer.</t227> <t228>The workers he employed were lazy and dishonest; the fields were overrun with weeds; the roofs of the buildings needed repair; the fences were neglected; and the animals were not being properly fed.</t228>
<t229>June had arrived, and the grass was almost ready to be mowed.</t229> <t230>Mr. Jones, having gone to Willingdon just before the summer solstice, which fell on a Saturday, and gotten dead drunk at the Red Lion tavern, could only return to the farm by noon on Sunday.</t230> <t231>The workers had milked the cows early in the morning and had gone rabbit hunting without feeding the animals.</t231> <t232>As soon as Mr. Jones returned home, he lay down on the couch in the living room and fell asleep while glancing at the News of the World newspaper.</t232> <t233>When night fell, the still-hungry animals could no longer bear it.</t233> <t234>One of the cows broke open the barn door with its horn; the animals rushed in and began to fill their bellies from the feed buckets.</t234> <t235>Just then, Mr. Jones woke up, grabbed his four workers, and ran to the barn; together, they started whipping the animals.</t235> <t236>This was the last straw for the animals.</t236> <t237>Despite not having planned anything beforehand, they collectively charged at the oppressors.</t237> <t238>They were butting and kicking Jones and his workers from all sides.</t238> <t239>The men, who had never seen the animals like this before, were bewildered; they were terrified by this unexpected rebellion from the animals they had beaten and tormented at will until that day.</t239> <t240>Seeing that things were not going well, they gave up trying to defend themselves and took to their heels.</t240> <t241>As they ran down the path towards the main road, the animals chased them with triumphant shouts.</t241>
<t242>Bayan Jones had seen what was happening from the window of her bedroom.</t242> <t243>She quickly gathered a few pieces of belongings, stuffed them into a saddlebag, and slipped away through the back road of the farm.</t243> <t244>Moses also jumped from his perch, flapping his wings and screaming at the top of his lungs as he followed the woman.</t244> <t245>Meanwhile, the animals had chased Jones and his men to the road, slamming the five-bar gate of the farm shut behind them.</t245> <t246>Thus, before they even realized what had happened, the Rebellion had succeeded, Jones had been expelled from the farm, and Manor Farm belonged to them.</t246>
<t247>The animals could not believe their luck for a while.</t247> <t248>First, they gathered together and circled the farm to see if there was a human hiding somewhere.</t248> <t249>Then, they ran to the farm buildings and began to destroy the last traces of Jones' sinister reign.</t249> <t250>The door of the room at the end of the stables, where the harnesses were kept, was broken; bits, nose rings, dog chains, and the cruel knives Mr. Jones used to castrate the pigs and lambs were thrown to the bottom of the well.</t250> <t251>Reins, halters, leather blinkers, humiliating feed bags were thrown into the fire where the trash in the yard was burned.</t251> <t252>Whips too.</t252> <t253>Seeing the whips engulfed in flames, all the animals were jumping with joy.</t253> <t254>Snowball also threw the ribbons that decorated the horses' manes and tails on market days into the fire.</t254>
<t255>"Clothing resembles humankind," he said.</t255> <t256>"A ribbon is also considered clothing.</t256> <t257>All animals should roam naked.</t257><t258>"</t258>
<t259>Upon hearing Snowball's words, Boxer grabbed the small straw hat he wore in the summer to protect his ears from flies and threw it into the fire.</t259>
<t260>Shortly after, the animals had destroyed everything that reminded them of Mr. Jones.</t260> <t261>Napoleon took them all back to the barn, distributed two rations of corn to everyone, and gave two biscuits each to the dogs.</t261> <t262>Then, they sang the song "Beasts of England" from start to finish exactly seven times; as night fell, everyone retreated to their corners and fell asleep.</t262> <t263>They had never slept so comfortably since they were born.</t263>
<t264>But as usual, when they woke up at dawn and remembered the magnificent uprising they had carried out the day before, they all ran to the meadow together.</t264> <t265>A little down the meadow, there was a small hill that overlooked a large part of the farm.</t265> <t266>They immediately climbed the hill and began to gaze at the surroundings in the clear light of the morning.</t266> <t267>Yes, it was theirs now; everything that stretched out before them as far as the eye could see was theirs!</t267> <t268>Overcome with this thought, they began to hop and jump, leaping into the air with great enthusiasm.</t268> <t269>They rolled on the dew-covered grass, plucked and devoured the sweet summer herbs, dug up the black soil and tossed it into the air, inhaling the beautiful scent of the earth.</t269> <t270>Then, they toured the entire farm and inspected it; they couldn't help but watch the field, the pasture, the orchard, the pond, and the grove in awe, as if they were struck dumb.</t270> <t271>It was as if they had never seen these places before; they still couldn't believe that all of this was now theirs.</t271>
<t272>Then, they lined up and returned to the farm buildings; when they reached the front door of the farmhouse, they held their breath and stopped.</t272><t273>This house was theirs now, but they were afraid to go inside.</t273><t274>Then, with Snowball and Napoleon shouldering the door and breaking it down, the animals entered in single file.</t274><t275>They took great care with their steps to avoid making a mess; as they tiptoed from room to room, they whispered as if afraid their voices would be heard; they looked at the splendor inside, the feather mattresses, the mirrors, the horsehair-covered settee, the Brussels carpet, and the lithograph portrait of Queen Victoria above the fireplace in the sitting room with a mix of awe and fear.</t275><t276>Just as they were descending the stairs, they noticed that Mollie was missing.</t276><t277>A few of them rushed upstairs and began checking the rooms one by one.</t277><t278>When they opened the door to the most elegant bedroom, what did they see!</t278><t279>Wasn't Mollie admiring herself foolishly in the mirror, holding a blue ribbon, which seemed to have been taken from Mrs. Jones's dressing table, over her shoulder!</t279><t280>They scolded Mollie severely and left the house.</t280><t281>The hams hanging in the kitchen were taken out and buried, and the beer barrel in the pantry was smashed by Boxer with a kick, that's all; nothing else in the house was touched.</t281><t282>Right then and there, they made a unanimous decision: The farmhouse would be preserved as a museum.</t282><t283>There was not the slightest disagreement among them: No animal should live in this house.</t283>
<t284>Snowball and Napoleon called the animals to a meeting again after breakfast.</t284>
<t285>"Comrades," said Snowball.</t285> <t286>"It is only half past six, a long day awaits us.</t286> <t287>Today we start mowing the hay.</t287> <t288>But first, we have a task to take care of.</t288><t289>"</t289>
<t290>In the end, it was understood that two pigs had found a reading book among the trash belonging to Mr. Jones's children, and over the past three months, they had learned to read and write from this book.</t290><t291>Napoleon had the black and white paint cans brought over, and leading the animals, he took them to the farm gate that opened onto the main road.</t291><t292>Snowball (he was the best at writing) took the brush between his two hooves and scribbled out the name MANOR FARM written on the top bar of the gate, replacing it with ANIMAL FARM.</t292><t293>From now on, the farm would be known by this name.</t293><t294>Afterwards, they returned to the farm buildings; Snowball and Napoleon had a ladder brought and leaned it against the wall of the big barn.</t294><t295>As a result of their three months of work, the pigs had managed to condense the fundamental principles of Animalism into seven commandments.</t295><t296>Now these seven commandments would be written on the wall, and from now on, all the animals on Animal Farm would adhere to these unchanging laws for the rest of their lives.</t296><t297>Snowball climbed the ladder with great difficulty (it is not easy for a pig to balance on a ladder) and set to work; Squealer was holding the paint can a few steps below.</t297><t298>The seven commandments were written on the tarred wall in large white letters that could be read from twenty or thirty meters away:</t298>
<t299>SEVEN COMMANDS</t299>
<t300>1.</t300> <t301>You will consider everyone who walks on two legs an enemy.</t301>
<t302>2.</t302> <t303>You will consider everyone who walks on four legs or has wings as a friend.</t303>
<t304>3.</t304> <t305>No animal shall wear clothes.</t305>
<t306>4.</t306> <t307>No animal shall sleep in a bed.</t307>
<t308>5.</t308> <t309>No animal shall drink alcohol.</t309>
<t310>6.</t310> <t311>No animal shall kill any other animal.</t311>
<t312>7.</t312> <t313>All animals are equal.</t313>
<t314>The commands were written with great care; except for "friend" being written as "toast" and one of the 's' letters being reversed, there were no spelling mistakes.</t314> <t315>Snowball read the commands aloud from start to finish so that everyone could understand.</t315> <t316>All the animals nodded their heads, indicating their complete submission to the commands.</t316> <t317>The smartest ones immediately began to memorize them.</t317>
<t318>Snowball threw the paintbrush to the ground and shouted, "Come on, comrades!"</t318> <t319>"To the field! Let's have the honor of harvesting the crop faster than Jones and his men.</t319><t320>"</t320>
<t321>But at that moment, three cows that had been looking tense for a while started to moo.</t321> <t322>Their udders were about to burst because they hadn't been milked for twenty-four hours.</t322> <t323>After thinking for a bit, the pigs brought the buckets, and since their forelegs were suited for the task, they expertly milked the cows.</t323> <t324>Soon, the buckets were filled with frothy, creamy milk; many of the animals were looking at the milk with watering mouths.</t324>
<t325>One of them asked, "What will happen to all this milk?"</t325>
<t326>"Jones sometimes added milk to our feed," said one of the chickens.</t326>
<t327>Thereupon, Napoleon stepped in front of the buckets and shouted, "Don't worry about the milk, comrades!"</t327> <t328>"It will be taken care of, don't worry.</t328> <t329>The harvest is more important.</t329> <t330>Comrade Snowball will take the lead.</t330> <t331>I'll be there shortly.</t331> <t332>Forward, comrades!</t332> <t333>The harvest awaits us.</t333><t334>"</t334>
<t335>The animals arrived at the field in a herd and started to harvest.</t335> <t336>When they returned in the evening, they would notice that the milk had disappeared.</t336>
<t337>Chapter Three</t337>
<t338>They worked like laborers until the harvest was done, drenched in sweat from head to toe!</t338> <t339>But their efforts were not in vain; the harvest was more bountiful than they had hoped.</t339>
<t340>From time to time, the milk they had sucked from their mothers came out of their noses; the tools were made for humans, not animals; not being able to use the tools that required them to stand on their hind legs was causing great difficulty.</t340> <t341>But the pigs were so smart that they found a way to overcome every difficulty.</t341> <t342>As for the horses; they knew the field inch by inch, and they understood the work of harvesting and gathering crops much better than Jones and his men.</t342> <t343>The pigs did not work directly; they managed and supervised the others.</t343> <t344>With their superior knowledge, it was natural for them to take on the leadership.</t344> <t345>Boxer and Clover harnessed themselves to the horse-drawn harrow (of course, bridles and reins were no longer used), slowly circling around the field; the pig following them would occasionally call out, "Gee, comrade!" or "Haw, comrade!"</t345> <t346>All the animals, from the largest to the smallest, worked in the harvesting and gathering of the crops.</t346> <t347>Even the ducks and chickens, running around from morning till night under the sun, carried bits of grass with their beaks.</t347> <t348>In the end, they harvested it in about two days less than Jones and his men would have.</t348> <t349>Moreover, it was the largest harvest the farm had ever seen.</t349> <t350>Furthermore, nothing was wasted; the sharp-eyed chickens and ducks gathered everything down to the smallest blade of grass.</t350> <t351>Not a single farm animal attempted to steal.</t351>
<t352>That summer, everything was going well on the farm.</t352> <t353>The animals were happier than they could ever have imagined.</t353> <t354>They were no longer dependent on the meager food given by their stingy owners; they were eating food produced by themselves and for themselves, and they savored every bite.</t354> <t355>Since the worthless, parasitic humans had disappeared, there was more food for everyone.</t355> <t356>Despite their lack of experience, they were able to find more free time.</t356> <t357>They faced many difficulties; for example, as the season progressed and harvest time came, they had to thresh the grain with their feet and winnow it by blowing it into the air, just like in ancient times, because there was no threshing machine on the farm; but with the intelligence of the pigs and the strong muscles of Boxer, they were able to overcome every challenge.</t357> <t358>Everyone admired Boxer.</t358> <t359>Boxer, who had been an indefatigable animal even during Jones's time, was now working with the strength of nearly three horses; there were days when the entire burden of the farm's work fell on his strong shoulders.</t359> <t360>He was always there where the work was hardest; from morning till night, he worked tirelessly.</t360> <t361>He had made an arrangement with one of the young roosters to wake him up half an hour earlier than the others in the mornings; before the daily tasks began, he would rush to the place where he was most needed and work there voluntarily.</t361> <t362>It was as if he had made work a law for himself: If a problem or a setback arose, he would immediately say, "I will work even harder!" and get to work.</t362>
<t363>Actually, everyone was working well according to their own strength and ability.</t363> <t364>For instance, the chickens and ducks had saved nearly twenty bushels of grain by collecting the scattered grains.</t364> <t365>No one was stealing, no one was grumbling about their assigned rations; fights, bites, and jealousies, which were once considered normal features of life on the farm, had almost entirely disappeared.</t365> <t366>No one was shirking work, except for one person.</t366> <t367>Yes, Mollie had a problem with not being able to get up early in the mornings; moreover, she would sometimes leave work early, using a stone in her hoof as an excuse.</t367> <t368>In truth, the cat was also peculiar.</t368> <t369>After a while, it was understood that she never appeared when there was work to be done.</t369> <t370>She would disappear for hours, but when it was time to eat or when the work was finished in the late afternoon, she would appear as if nothing had happened.</t370> <t371>But each time, she would come up with such good excuses and purr so affectionately that she managed to convince everyone of her good intentions.</t371> <t372>The old donkey Benjamin seemed unchanged since the Rebellion.</t372> <t373>Just like in Mr. Jones's time, he was still sluggish and stubborn; he neither shirked work nor was he eager to work too hard.</t373> <t374>He did not express the slightest opinion about the Rebellion and its consequences.</t374> <t375>When asked if he was happier after Jones left the farm, he would simply say, "Donkeys live a long time.</t375> <t376>Have you ever seen a dead donkey in your life?" and leave everyone to settle for this ambiguous answer.</t376>
<t377>Sundays were not for working.</t377> <t378>After a breakfast that was an hour later than usual, a ceremony was held every Sunday, starting with the raising of the flag.</t378> <t379>In the room where the harnesses were kept, Snowball had found an old tablecloth of Mrs. Jones's, and had painted a hoof and a horn in white on the green cloth.</t379> <t380>The flag was raised on the flagpole in the farmhouse garden every Sunday morning.</t380> <t381>According to Snowball's explanation, the green background of the flag represented the lush fields of England, while the hoof and horn symbolized the future Animal Republic that would be born when the human race was finally overthrown.</t381> <t382>After the flag was raised, all the animals would gather in the large barn to attend the general assembly known as the Meeting.</t382> <t383>At the Meeting, the work for the coming week was planned, and decisions were discussed.</t383> <t384>The decisions to be made were always proposed by the pigs.</t384> <t385>The other animals knew how to vote, but they could never come up with any resolutions on their own.</t385> <t386>The most fervent debaters at the Meetings were Snowball and Napoleon.</t386> <t387>But these two never agreed: Whatever one proposed, the other was sure to oppose.</t387> <t388>Even when a decision was reached that no one could dispute, they found a way to quarrel with each other.</t388> <t389>For example, after it was decided that the pasture behind the orchard would be set aside as a grazing area for animals no longer able to work, they argued over what the retirement age for the different types of animals should be.</t389> <t390>At the end of every Meeting, the song "Beasts of England" was sung, and the afternoons were devoted to recreation.</t390>
<t391>The pigs had established their headquarters in the room where the harnesses were kept.</t391> <t392>In the evenings, they would read and learn necessary trades like blacksmithing and carpentry from the books they had brought from the farmhouse.</t392> <t393>Snowball was also busy organizing the other animals into Animal Committees, tirelessly putting in effort for this task.</t393> <t394>In addition to literacy classes, he had established the Egg Production Committee for the hens, the Clean Tails League for the cows, the Wild Comrades' Re-education Committee for the domestication of rats and rabbits, and the Whiter Wool Movement for the sheep.</t394> <t395>Most of these initiatives did not yield results.</t395> <t396>For instance, the attempt to domesticate wild animals failed from the start.</t396> <t397>The wild animals continued to behave as they always had, immediately taking advantage of the leniency shown to them.</t397> <t398>The cat had joined the Re-education Committee and worked diligently for a while.</t398> <t399>One day, they found her sitting on the roof, talking to sparrows that were out of her reach; she was telling them that all animals were now comrades and that they could come and perch on her paw without any fear if they wished.</t399> <t400>But the sparrows did not even come close to the cat.</t400>
<t401>On the other hand, the literacy classes had been very successful.</t401> <t402>By the time autumn came, almost every animal on the farm knew how to read and write to some extent.</t402>
<t403>The pigs' literacy was flawless.</t403> <t404>The dogs had learned to read very well, but they read nothing other than the Seven Commandments.</t404> <t405>Muriel the goat read even better than the dogs; some evenings, she would bring pieces of newspaper she found in the garbage and read them to the other animals.</t405> <t406>Benjamin, who could read as well as the pigs, was rarely seen using this ability.</t406> <t407>"I don't see anything worth reading," he would say.</t407> <t408>Clover had learned the alphabet from start to finish, but she couldn't make out the words.</t408> <t409>As for Boxer, he couldn't get past D.</t409> <t410>He would write the letters A, B, C, D on the ground with his large hoof, then he would lay his ears back, shake his mane, and stare blankly at the letters, trying to figure out the letter that came after D, but he could never manage it.</t410> <t411>A few times, he had learned E, F, G, H, but as soon as he learned them, he realized he had forgotten A, B, C, D, and finally decided to settle for the first four letters of the alphabet; to avoid forgetting them, he would write these four letters once or twice every day.</t411> <t412>As for Mollie, she stubbornly refused to learn any letter other than the six letters in her name.</t412> <t413>She would arrange thin branches to spell out her name, decorate them with a few flowers, and then circle around them admiringly.</t413>
<t414>None of the other animals on the farm could get beyond the letter A; it was observed that the most foolish animals like sheep, chickens, and ducks could never memorize the Seven Commandments.</t414> <t415>Snowball, who put a lot of thought into solving this problem, finally announced that the Seven Commandments could actually be reduced to a single maxim.</t415> <t416>The Seven Commandments could easily be reduced to the maxim, "four legs good, two legs bad."</t416> <t417>According to Snowball, this maxim contained the fundamental principle of animalism.</t417> <t418>Anyone who thoroughly understood this fundamental principle could be protected from the harmful effects of mankind.</t418> <t419>At first, the birds objected to this maxim on the grounds that they too had two legs; but Snowball was quick to prove them wrong.</t419>
<t420>"Comrades," he said.</t420> <t421>"The wing of a bird is an organ used not for work, but for movement.</t421> <t422>Therefore, the wing should be considered as a foot.</t422> <t423>The difference of mankind lies in the hand, the tool with which all devilry is done.</t423><t424>"</t424>
<t425>Despite not understanding anything from Snowball's words, the birds accepted his explanation.</t425> <t426>All the animals began to memorize the new maxim. On the wall of the barn, above the Seven Commandments, it was written in even larger letters: FOUR LEGS GOOD, TWO LEGS BAD.</t426> <t427>After memorizing these words, the sheep loved the maxim so much that while lounging in the meadow, they would habitually bleat together, "Four legs good, two legs bad!</t427> <t428>Four legs good, two legs bad!" tirelessly for hours.</t428>
<t429>Napoleon had never been interested in Snowball's committees.</t429> <t430>He believed that educating the young was far more important than anything that could be done for those who were already grown up.</t430> <t431>Jessie and Bluebell had given birth to nine sturdy puppies immediately after the harvest.</t431> <t432>As soon as they were weaned, Napoleon took them away from their mothers, saying that he would be responsible for their education.</t432> <t433>He then secluded them in a loft which could only be reached by a ladder from the harness-room, keeping them so out of sight that the rest of the farm soon forgot their existence.</t433>
<t434>It was soon understood where the milk had gone.</t434> <t435>The milk was being mixed into the pigs' mash every day.</t435> <t436>The apples were now starting to ripen; the grass of the orchard was covered with apples fallen by the wind.</t436> <t437>The animals naturally hoped that the apples would be shared equally; however, one day it was ordered that all the apples fallen from the trees be collected and delivered to the pigs in the room where the harnesses were kept.</t437> <t438>Some animals grumbled, but it was of no use.</t438> <t439>All the pigs, even Snowball and Napoleon, were of the same mind on this matter.</t439>
<t440>Squealer, who was tasked with making the necessary explanations to the other animals, shouted, "Comrades!"</t440> <t441>"I hope you do not think that we pigs are doing this out of selfishness or a love for privilege.</t441> <t442>In fact, most of us do not like milk and apples.</t442> <t443>I do not like them either.</t443> <t444>The only reason we are taking these apples is to preserve our health.</t444> <t445>There are certain substances in milk and apples that are absolutely necessary for the health of pigs.</t445> <t446>Science has proven this, comrades.</t446> <t447>We pigs are the brainworkers.</t447> <t448>We are responsible for the management and organization of this farm.</t448> <t449>We work day and night to safeguard your well-being.</t449> <t450>We drink this milk and eat these apples for your sake.</t450> <t451>Do you know what would happen if we pigs failed to perform our duty properly?</t451> <t452>Jones would come back!</t452> <t453>Yes, Jones would come back!</t453> <t454>Have no doubt about that, comrades."</t454> <t455>Then, jumping from side to side and wagging his tail, he shouted: "I believe there is not a single animal among you who wants Jones to come back!</t455><t456>"</t456>
<t457>If there was one thing the animals had no doubt about, it was that they did not want Jones to return.</t457> <t458>The importance of keeping the pigs healthy was very clear.</t458> <t459>Thus, before the argument grew, it was agreed by everyone that all the milk and the apples that fell from the trees due to the wind (naturally, also the apples picked from the trees when they ripened) would be allocated to the pigs.</t459>
<t460>Chapter Four</t460>
<t461>By the end of summer, almost the entire country had heard about what was happening at Animal Farm.</t461> <t462>The carrier pigeons that Snowball and Napoleon sent out every day were making friends with the animals on neighboring farms, telling them the story of the Rebellion, and teaching them the song "Beasts of England."</t462>
<t463>Meanwhile, Mr. Jones spent most of his time lounging at the Red Lion tavern in Willingdon; whenever he found someone to listen to him, he would immediately start complaining, saying he had been terribly wronged and driven out of his farm by a bunch of lowly animals.</t463> <t464>The other farmers had met him with understanding, but initially, they were not very inclined to help.</t464> <t465>Each of them was secretly thinking about how they could benefit from Jones's misfortune.</t465> <t466>Fortunately, the owners of the two farms neighboring Animal Farm could never get along with each other.</t466> <t467>Foxwood was a large, neglected, and run-down farm; it was overgrown with bushes, its pastures had withered, and its fences were in tatters.</t467> <t468>The owner of Foxwood, Mr. Pilkington, spent most of his time fishing during the fishing season and hunting during the hunting season; he was a laid-back, gentlemanly man.</t468> <t469>Pinchfield Farm, on the other hand, was smaller but better maintained.</t469> <t470>The owner of Pinchfield, Mr. Frederick, was a bully and a cunning man; he was constantly involved in lawsuits; money was his religion, and once he got his hands on something, he wouldn't let go.</t470> <t471>These two hated each other so much that they couldn't agree even on matters that were in their mutual interest.</t471>
<t472>However, both of them were very afraid of the Rebellion at Animal Farm; they were doing everything they could to prevent the animals on their own farms from getting detailed information about the rebellion.</t472> <t473>In fact, at first, they had laughed a lot at the idea that animals could run a farm on their own; they thought that this would collapse in ten or fifteen days at most.</t473> <t474>They had spread rumors that the animals at Manor Farm (they insisted on referring to the farm as Manor Farm, they couldn't tolerate the name "Animal Farm") were constantly quarreling with each other and would soon die of starvation.</t474> <t475>But when it turned out after a while that the animals were not dying of starvation, they changed their tune and started talking about the mind-boggling devilry at Animal Farm.</t475> <t476>According to these two farmers, cannibalism had taken hold at Animal Farm; the animals were torturing each other with hot horseshoes and sharing their females communally.</t476> <t477>Frederick and Pilkington said that all of this was the natural consequence of rebelling against the laws of nature.</t477>
<t478>But these stories did not seem credible to anyone.</t478> <t479>It was said that there was an extraordinary farm where animals drove out humans and managed everything themselves, and rumors about this continued with all their uncertainty and distortion.</t479> <t480>A wave of rebellion rose throughout the year on the surrounding farms.</t480> <t481>Bulls known to be docile suddenly went wild, sheep broke through fences and devoured clover, cows kicked over buckets, horses disobeyed orders, and suddenly stopped, throwing their riders over the fences to the other side.</t481> <t482>Most importantly, the tune and lyrics of the song "Animals of England" were now known everywhere.</t482> <t483>It had spread with unexpected speed.</t483> <t484>Although people claimed to find it very ridiculous, they couldn't help but feel great anger when they heard this song.</t484> <t485>They argued that they couldn't even comprehend how such a disgraceful and absurd song could be sung by animals.</t485> <t486>Animals caught singing the song were whipped on the spot, yet the spread of the song could not be prevented.</t486> <t487>While blackbirds whistled among the bushes and pigeons cooed in the trees, they were always singing this song; the melodies of the song mingled with the hammer blows of blacksmiths and the chimes of church bells.</t487>
<t488>It was early October; the crops had been harvested and stacked, and the threshing was largely completed.</t488> <t489>One day, suddenly, carrier pigeons came circling swiftly and landed in the courtyard of Animal Farm, flapping anxiously.</t489> <t490>According to the news they brought, Jones and his men, along with half a dozen men from the Foxwood and Pinchfield farms, had entered through the barred gate and were coming up the driveway to the farm.</t490> <t491>Jones, with a rifle in hand, was walking at the front; the men with sticks were following him.</t491> <t492>Obviously, they had made up their minds to take back the farm.</t492>
<t493>In fact, since such an attempt had been expected for a long time, all precautions had been taken, and all necessary preparations had been made.</t493> <t494>Snowball, who had gained extensive knowledge about Julius Caesar's campaigns by reading an old book he found in the farmhouse, was appointed to the command of the defense operation.</t494> <t495>He immediately gave his orders; all the animals took their positions within a few minutes.</t495>
<t496>As the people approached the farm buildings, Snowball initiated the first attack.</t496> <t497>Exactly thirty-five pigeons flew over the men's heads, defecating on them.</t497> <t498>While the men tried to chase away the pigeons, the geese, hidden behind the fence, suddenly rushed forward and began savagely pecking at their calves.</t498> <t499>However, this was merely a feint to cause some confusion; indeed, the men easily drove the geese back with their sticks.</t499> <t500>This time, Snowball initiated the second attack.</t500> <t501>Muriel, Benjamin, and all the sheep, led by Snowball, charged forward, butting and horn-thrusting the men from all sides; meanwhile, Benjamin kept kicking back.</t501> <t502>But with their sticks in hand and hobnailed boots on their feet, the men were still stronger than the animals.</t502> <t503>When Snowball suddenly squealed, signaling a retreat, all the animals turned back, dashed through the passage, and plunged into the yard.</t503>
<t504>The men shouting victory cries, thinking their enemies were fleeing, ran chaotically after them.</t504> <t505>This was exactly what Snowball wanted.</t505> <t506>Once they all entered the yard, the three horses, three cows, and the other pigs who were lying in ambush in the barn suddenly appeared and cut off the men's retreat.</t506> <t507>It was at that moment that Snowball gave the signal to attack and charged straight at Jones.</t507> <t508>Seeing Snowball coming at him, Jones aimed his rifle and fired.</t508> <t509>The pellets opened bloody furrows on Snowball's back; one of the sheep died on the spot.</t509> <t510>Without a moment's hesitation, Snowball, with his hundred-kilo body, lunged at Jones's legs.</t510> <t511>As Jones tumbled onto a manure pile, his rifle flew out of his hand.</t511> <t512>But the most terrifying was Boxer; rearing up on his hind legs, he fought like a stallion, swinging his massive iron-shod hooves.</t512> <t513>The first blow landed on the head of a stable boy from Foxwood Farm, who collapsed into the mud and died on the spot.</t513> <t514>Seeing this, many of the men dropped their sticks and tried to flee.</t514> <t515>They were seized with panic.</t515> <t516>At that moment, all the animals chased after the men, pursuing them around the yard.</t516> <t517>They gored, kicked, bit, and trampled anyone who lagged behind.</t517> <t518>Not a single animal on the farm failed to take its revenge on the men.</t518> <t519>Even the cat suddenly leaped from the roof onto a cowherd's back, digging its claws into his neck and making him scream in pain.</t519> <t520>The men, finding an opportunity, bolted out of the yard and started running full speed towards the main road.</t520> <t521>It had been less than five minutes since they had raided the farm, yet they were retreating in disgrace, just as they had come.</t521> <t522>A flock of geese, hissing as they followed, pecked at their legs all the way down the road.</t522>
<t523>They had all escaped, except for one.</t523> <t524>Boxer was nudging the stable boy who was lying face down in the mud in the yard with his front hoof, trying to turn him over, but the boy wasn't moving.</t524>
<t525>Boxer said sadly, "He's dead."</t525> <t526>"I had no intention of killing him.</t526> <t527>I forgot that I had iron shoes on my feet.</t527> <t528>Who will believe now that I didn't do it on purpose?</t528><t529>"</t529>
<t530>With his wounds still bleeding, Snowball shouted, "No need for sentimentality, comrade!"</t530> <t531>"War is war.</t531> <t532>The best human is a dead human.</t532><t533>"</t533>
<t534>"I don't want to take anyone's life," said Boxer.</t534> <t535>His eyes were filled with tears.</t535>
<t536>At that moment, someone shouted, "Where is Mollie?"</t536>
<t537>Indeed, Mollie was missing.</t537> <t538>Suddenly, there was chaos.</t538> <t539>Had something happened to her?</t539> <t540>Could the men have kidnapped Mollie?</t540> <t541>After a long search, they found Mollie in the barn; she had hidden in her stall, burying her head in the hay in the manger.</t541> <t542>She had bolted as soon as the guns went off.</t542> <t543>When those who went to look for Mollie returned to the yard, they saw that the groom was nowhere to be found.</t543> <t544>Apparently, the young man they thought was dead had only fainted; he had come to later and made a run for it.</t544>
<t545>The animals had reunited with wild enthusiasm, shouting at the top of their lungs as they recounted to each other the heroics they had shown in the battle.</t545> <t546>They immediately organized a ceremony right then and there to celebrate the victory.</t546> <t547>They hoisted the flag and sang "Beasts of England" several times.</t547> <t548>Then, they held a solemn burial ceremony for the sheep they had lost in the battle, planting a hawthorn sapling over its grave.</t548> <t549>Snowball, giving a short speech at the grave, emphasized that if necessary, all animals should be ready to die for Animal Farm.</t549>
<t550>The animals unanimously decided to establish a military decoration.</t550> <t551>The "First Class Hero Animal" medal was immediately awarded to Snowball and Boxer right there.</t551> <t552>These brass medals (actually, old horse trappings they found in the room where the harnesses were kept) were to be worn on Sundays and holidays.</t552> <t553>The sheep that had lost its life in the battle was deemed worthy of the "Second Class Hero Animal" medal.</t553>
<t554>The name of the war was discussed at length.</t554> <t555>In the end, it was decided to call it the "Battle of the Cowshed"; the ambushing animals had launched their attack from there.</t555> <t556>Mr. Jones's gun was found in the mud.</t556> <t557>They knew there were a few boxes of cartridges in the farmhouse.</t557> <t558>It was decided that the gun, like a cannon, would be placed at the base of the flagpole and that a ceremonial shot would be fired twice a year, once on October 12th, the anniversary of the Battle of the Cowshed, and the other on Midsummer Day, the anniversary of the Rebellion.</t558>
<t559>Fifth Chapter</t559>
<t560>As winter approached, Mollie was acting even stranger.</t560> <t561>Every morning she came to work late, apologizing by saying she had overslept, and despite having a good appetite, she complained of some inexplicable pains.</t561> <t562>She would make up an excuse to avoid work, go to the trough, and watch her reflection in the water foolishly.</t562> <t563>But there were also more serious rumors circulating around.</t563> <t564>One day, when Mollie entered the yard cheerfully with a straw in her mouth, wagging her tail, Clover pulled her aside.</t564>
<t565>"Look, Mollie," he said, "I have something very serious to tell you.</t565> <t566>This morning, I saw you looking over the fence that separates Animal Farm from Foxwood Farm.</t566> <t567>On the other side of the fence, there was one of Mr. Pilkington's men.</t567> <t568>Although I was very far away, I am almost certain that I saw him talking to you and you didn't object to him stroking your nose.</t568> <t569>What does this mean, Mollie?</t569><t570>"</t570>
<t571>"No! He didn't stroke my nose or anything!" shouted Mollie.</t571> <t572>"I didn't do such a thing!"</t572> <t573>"Lies!" She was stamping her feet and scratching the ground with them.</t573>
<t574>"Mollie! Look at my face.</t574> <t575>Do you swear on your honor that man didn't stroke your nose?</t575><t576>"</t576>
<t577>Mollie, "Lies!</t577> <t578>Nothing like that happened!" she repeated, but she avoided Clover's eyes and galloped away towards the field.</t578>
<t579>Suddenly, Clover's mind got stuck on something.</t579> <t580>Without saying anything to anyone, she entered Mollie's stall in the barn, and when she dug a little with her foot, she saw that a handful of sugar cubes and various colored ribbons were hidden among the straw.</t580>
<t581>Three days later, Mollie disappeared.</t581> <t582>For a long time, no information could be obtained about where she was, until the pigeons reported that they had seen her in Willingdon.</t582> <t583>She was harnessed to a small, stylish, red-and-black cart standing in front of a tavern.</t583> <t584>A fat, rosy-cheeked man, who looked like a tavern keeper, wearing checkered pants and gaiters, was stroking Mollie's nose and feeding her sugar.</t584> <t585>A red ribbon was tied to the forelock of Mollie, whose coat had been freshly clipped.</t585> <t586>According to the pigeons, she seemed to be in good spirits.</t586> <t587>From that day on, the animals never mentioned Mollie's name again.</t587>
<t588>In January, the weather became extremely cold.</t588> <t589>The ground was so hard that it was impossible to work in the fields.</t589> <t590>Meeting after meeting was being held in the large barn, and the pigs were trying to plan the work for the coming season.</t590> <t591>The authority to make decisions on all matters related to farm politics was given to the pigs, who were clearly more intelligent than the other animals; although their decisions had to be approved by a majority vote.</t591> <t592>If it weren't for the constant quarrels between Snowball and Napoleon, who clashed on almost every issue, this system would have worked quite well.</t592> <t593>If one proposed to expand the area planted with barley, the other would argue that the area planted with oats should be expanded; if one said a field was suitable for growing cabbages, the other would claim that nothing but root crops could be grown there.</t593> <t594>Both had their supporters; sometimes fierce arguments would break out.</t594> <t595>With his brilliant speeches, Snowball often managed to win the majority of votes at meetings; but Napoleon was no less skilled at garnering support through behind-the-scenes work.</t595> <t596>He was particularly good at influencing the sheep.</t596> <t597>The sheep, who had recently developed the habit of bleating "Four legs good, two legs bad!" at every opportunity, were frequently disrupting the meetings.</t597> <t598>It was particularly noticeable that they would start bleating "Four legs good, two legs bad!" at the most crucial points of Snowball's speeches.</t598> <t599>Snowball had read and studied old issues of a magazine called Farmer and Stockbreeder, which he found in the farmhouse, and had come up with a lot of plans for the renovation and improvement of the farm.</t599> <t600>He gave speeches demonstrating how well he knew topics such as opening water channels in the fields, preserving fodder in silos, and how to make use of manure.</t600> <t601>He had developed a complex plan for all the animals to defecate directly in the fields, in a different spot each day; this way, they would also save the labor and time spent transporting manure to the fields by cart.</t601> <t602>Napoleon, on the other hand, did not come up with a single original idea, quietly spreading the notion that Snowball's plans were useless, as if he were waiting for the right moment.</t602> <t603>But the fiercest argument between them would break out over the windmill.</t603>
<t604>There was a small hill in the meadow that stretched out just beyond the farm buildings.</t604> <t605>This was the highest point of the farm.</t605> <t606>After carefully examining the ground, Snowball declared that this was the most suitable place for a windmill.</t606> <t607>The windmill could operate a dynamo and provide electrical power to the entire farm.</t607> <t608>Thus, the barns could be illuminated and heated in winter; tools such as a circular saw, hay and straw cutter, beet slicer, and electric milking machine could be used.</t608> <t609>The animals had never heard of such a thing before (Beilik Farm, being an ancient farm, only had the most primitive tools); they listened to Snowball in astonishment as he conjured up those fantastical devices before their eyes.</t609> <t610>According to Snowball's descriptions, these incredible devices would handle all the farm's work, and they would lounge in the fields, enjoying themselves, reading books, and engaging in conversations to improve themselves.</t610>
<t611>Snowball's plans for the windmill were finalized in a few weeks.</t611><t612>A large portion of the mechanical details were obtained from Mr. Jones's three books: A Thousand and One Tips for Your Home, Do It Yourself Wall Building, and Electricity in Ten Lessons.</t612><t613>Snowball was using the shed, where the incubators once stood and which had a smooth wooden floor suitable for drawing, as his study room.</t613><t614>Sometimes he would lock himself in the shed for hours.</t614><t615>He placed weights on the pages of the books he laid on the ground, held a piece of chalk between the hooves of his front foot, and as he quickly made the drawings, he would get so excited that he was out of breath, making short, gasping sounds from his throat.</t615><t616>Snowball's drawings gradually turned into a complex heap of levers and gears, covering more than half of the shed.</t616><t617>The other animals did not understand any of this, but they found it very impressive.</t617><t618>They came to look at Snowball's drawings at least once a day.</t618><t619>The chickens and ducks also came, struggling not to step on the chalk-drawn lines.</t619><t620>Only Napoleon, who had declared his opposition to the windmill from the very beginning, stayed away from there.</t620><t621>But he couldn't resist; one day, out of the blue, he came to see the drawings.</t621><t622>He slowly wandered inside the shed, examined every detail of the drawings at length, sniffed and prodded them several times, stood there for a while watching out of the corner of his eye, then suddenly lifted his leg and urinated on the drawings, and left without saying a single word.</t622>
<t623>The windmill issue had led to a deep division on the farm.</t623> <t624>Snowball did not deny that building the windmill would be very difficult.</t624> <t625>Stones would have to be carried from the quarry, walls built, the windmill's blades made, and then dynamos and cables would need to be found.</t625> <t626>(Snowball never mentioned how all these tasks would be accomplished) He merely claimed that all the work would be completed within a year.</t626> <t627>According to him, once the windmill was completed, work would become so easy that the animals would only need to work three days a week.</t627> <t628>In contrast, Napoleon argued that their greatest need was to increase food production and that if time was wasted on the windmill, everyone would die of starvation.</t628> <t629>The animals had split into two factions under the slogans "Vote for Snowball and work three days a week!" and "Vote for Napoleon and never go hungry!"</t629> <t630>The only animal who remained outside the factions was Benjamin.</t630> <t631>He believed neither in the coming of abundance nor that the windmill would make things easier.</t631> <t632>"Whether there is a windmill or not, nothing will change in our miserable lives," he said.</t632>
<t633>While the windmill debates continued, there was also the issue of defending the farm.</t633> <t634>Despite having been defeated in the Battle of the Cowshed, it was now understood by all the animals that the humans might make a second, more determined attempt to recapture the farm and return it to Mr. Jones.</t634> <t635>The news of their defeat had spread to all the villages, causing the animals on neighboring farms to become even more rebellious; thus, the likelihood of the humans launching another attack had increased.</t635> <t636>Snowball and Napoleon, as with everything else, could not agree on this matter either.</t636> <t637>According to Napoleon, the animals needed to find firearms from somewhere and learn how to use them.</t637> <t638>Snowball, on the other hand, believed that they should send more pigeons to the other farms and incite the animals to rebel.</t638> <t639>One argued that if they couldn't defend themselves, they would inevitably be defeated in the end; the other said that if uprisings broke out everywhere, there would be no need to defend themselves.</t639> <t640>The animals listened to Napoleon and Snowball in turn, but they couldn't decide who was right.</t640> <t641>More precisely, they agreed with whoever was speaking at the time.</t641>
<t642>In the end, Snowball's plans came true.</t642> <t643>In the Meeting to be held next Sunday, the proposal to start the construction of the windmill would be put to a vote.</t643> <t644>When the animals gathered in the big barn, Snowball stood up and, despite his speech being interrupted by the bleating of the sheep, he listed the reasons why the windmill should be built.</t644> <t645>Then, Napoleon stood up to respond.</t645> <t646>In a very calm voice, he said that the windmill was nothing but nonsense, that he could not advise anyone to vote for the windmill, and immediately sat down.</t646> <t647>His speech had not even lasted half a minute; he seemed unaware of the impact of his words.</t647> <t648>Upon this, Snowball jumped up, silencing the sheep who had started bleating again, and delivered a passionate speech about the benefits of the windmill.</t648> <t649>Until that moment, the number of animals in favor of the windmill and those against it seemed roughly equal, but Snowball's eloquence quickly broke the tie.</t649> <t650>With brilliant words, Snowball painted a picture of an Animal Farm where the animals would be freed from working like slaves, and his imagination now extended far beyond chaff cutters and beet slicers.</t650> <t651>He said that threshing machines, plows, harrows, rollers, reapers, and binders would all be powered by electricity, and that every barn would have its own light, hot and cold water, and its own electric heater.</t651> <t652>When he finished his speech, there was no doubt left about where the votes would go.</t652> <t653>But just at that moment, Napoleon stood up, glanced sideways at Snowball, and let out a high-pitched scream that no one had ever heard before.</t653>
<t654>At that moment, terrifying barks were heard from outside, and soon nine large dogs with spiked collars burst in like a spear.</t654><t655>They lunged straight at Snowball.</t655><t656>If Snowball hadn't leaped out of the way just in time, he would have been devoured by the ferociously attacking dogs.</t656><t657>He immediately threw himself outside, with the dogs in pursuit.</t657><t658>The animals, struck dumb with astonishment and fear, crowded at the door and began to watch the chase.</t658><t659>Snowball was running as fast as a pig could run, trying to cross the meadow and reach the main road.</t659><t660>But the dogs were right on his heels.</t660><t661>Suddenly, he slipped and fell; just when everyone thought he was surely caught, he got back up and started running even faster.</t661><t662>The dogs were like a storm, they were about to catch their prey.</t662><t663>One of them was just about to grab his tail, but Snowball pulled it away just in time.</t663><t664>With the dogs nearly an inch away from him, he made one last effort and dashed forward, escaping through one of the holes in the fence.</t664><t665>Snowball was never seen again.</t665>
<t666>The animals, silent and cowed, returned to the barn.</t666> <t667>Soon after, the dogs came running.</t667> <t668>At first, no one could understand where these monsters had come from, but the truth soon emerged.</t668> <t669>These were the pups that Napoleon had separated from their mothers and specially trained.</t669> <t670>Although they were not fully grown, they were quite large; they looked as wild as wolves.</t670> <t671>They never left Napoleon's side.</t671> <t672>Just as the other dogs had fawned over Mr. Jones, it did not escape anyone's notice that they wagged their tails at Napoleon.</t672>
<t673>Napoleon, with his dogs behind him, climbed to the elevation where once the Great Leader had given speeches and announced that the Sunday morning meetings would be discontinued: These unnecessary meetings were nothing but a waste of time.</t673> <t674>Henceforth, all issues regarding the operation of the farm would be resolved by a special committee of pigs, presided over by himself.</t674> <t675>The committee would discuss the issues in closed sessions and later communicate the decisions to the other animals.</t675> <t676>The animals would still gather on Sunday mornings to salute the flag, sing the "Beasts of England" song, and receive weekly orders, but debates would no longer be permitted.</t676>
<t677>The animals, who had not yet recovered from the shock of Snowball's expulsion, fell into even deeper despair at this explanation.</t677> <t678>Some of them would have protested if they could find a proper reason.</t678> <t679>Even Boxer was uneasy.</t679> <t680>He laid his ears back, shook his mane, and tried to gather his thoughts; but he couldn't find anything to say.</t680> <t681>Some of the pigs, however, did not hesitate to express their thoughts openly.</t681> <t682>The four young pigs in the front row all stood up together and loudly declared that they did not approve of what was happening.</t682> <t683>But when the dogs lying at Napoleon's feet suddenly growled in a frightening manner, they had to fall silent and sit back down.</t683> <t684>At that moment, the sheep also began to bleat, "Four legs good, two legs bad!" in a deafening chorus.</t684> <t685>The demonstration went on so long that there was no opportunity to discuss the matter.</t685>
<t686>After a while, Squealer was given the task of touring the farm and explaining the new order to the other animals.</t686>
<t687>"Comrades," said Squealer, "I have no doubt that all the animals here understand very well the great sacrifice Comrade Napoleon has made by taking on such a duty.</t687> <t688>Comrades, do not think that leadership is about lying back and enjoying oneself.</t688> <t689>On the contrary, leadership imposes a very heavy responsibility.</t689> <t690>Among us, it is Comrade Napoleon who most believes that all animals are equal.</t690> <t691>He would be very happy to allow you to make decisions on your own.</t691> <t692>But comrades, sometimes you might make wrong decisions, and then what would become of us?</t692> <t693>For example, if you had decided to follow Snowball, who advocated that windmill nonsense, what would we have done?</t693> <t694>Hasn't it now become clear that Snowball is nothing but a traitor?</t694><t695>"</t695>
<t696>One of the animals said, "Snowball fought bravely in the Battle of the Cowshed."</t696>
<t697>"Bravery is not enough," replied Squealer.</t697> <t698>"Loyalty and obedience are more important.</t698> <t699>As for the Battle of the Cowshed; I believe that one day you will understand that Snowball's role in this battle has been greatly exaggerated.</t699> <t700>Discipline, comrades, iron discipline!</t700> <t701>Today, this should be our motto.</t701> <t702>If we take a single wrong step, our enemies will be upon us immediately.</t702> <t703>Comrades, surely you do not want Jones to come back!</t703><t704>"</t704>
<t705>This question also remained unanswered.</t705> <t706>Of course, they did not want Jones to come back; if the meetings held on Sunday mornings had the potential to lead to Jones's return, the discussions undoubtedly had to be stopped.</t706> <t707>Boxer, who was turning over the events in his mind, expressed everyone's thoughts: "If Comrade Napoleon says so, then it is so."</t707> <t708>From that day on, in addition to the motto he adopted for himself, "I will work harder," he also took up the saying, "Napoleon is always right."</t708>
<t709>With the arrival of spring, the weather had warmed up, and the fields had begun to be plowed.</t709> <t710>The shed where Snowball had made the windmill drawings was closed, and if the rumors were true, the drawings on the ground had also been erased.</t710> <t711>The animals gathered in the big barn every Sunday morning at ten o'clock to receive the weekly orders.</t711> <t712>The skull of Old Major, now completely dried out, had been dug up from where it was buried in the orchard and placed on a stump next to the flagpole, beside the gun.</t712> <t713>After the flag was hoisted, the animals had to pass respectfully in front of the skull before entering the barn.</t713> <t714>In the barn, they no longer sat together as they used to.</t714> <t715>Napoleon sat in front of the raised platform; a pig named Minimus, who had an extraordinary talent for writing poetry and composing songs, and Squealer sat on either side of him.</t715> <t716>Nine young dogs formed a semicircle around them, while the other pigs sat further back.</t716> <t717>All the remaining animals lined up facing them, opposite the raised platform.</t717> <t718>Napoleon read the weekly orders in a stern, military-like voice, the song "Beasts of England" was sung once, and then everyone dispersed.</t718>
<t719>It had only been three Sundays since Snowball was expelled from the farm.</t719> <t720>When Napoleon suddenly announced that the windmill had to be built, all the animals were stunned.</t720> <t721>Napoleon did not explain the reason for this sudden change of mind, he only warned everyone that this heavy task would require very hard work; even the reduction of rations might be in question.</t721> <t722>But the plans were prepared down to the finest details.</t722> <t723>A special committee of pigs had been brainstorming for three weeks.</t723> <t724>The construction of the windmill, with some modifications, could take two years.</t724>
<t725>That evening, Squealer told the other animals that Napoleon had never actually opposed the windmill project.</t725> <t726>On the contrary, Napoleon was the first to advocate for this project; in fact, the designs that Snowball had drawn on the barn floor were actually stolen from Napoleon's files.</t726> <t727>The windmill had, in reality, originated from his idea.</t727>
<t728>One of the animals couldn't help but ask: "If it was born from his idea, why did Napoleon oppose the windmill so fiercely?" A devilish expression appeared on Squealer's face: "Comrade Napoleon acted cunningly," he said.</t728> <t729>"Snowball was a dangerous one, setting a bad example for everyone.</t729> <t730>Comrade Napoleon appeared to be against the windmill to get rid of him."</t730> <t731>According to Squealer, now that Snowball was out of the picture, the windmill project could be easily implemented.</t731> <t732>This was what they called tactics.</t732> <t733>Squealer, hopping and skipping, laughing merrily and wagging his tail, repeated several times, "Tactics, comrades, tactics!"</t733> <t734>The animals didn't really understand much from the word "tactics"; but Squealer spoke so convincingly, and the three dogs that happened to be beside him by coincidence were growling so menacingly, that they accepted Squealer's explanation without further objection.</t734>
<t735>Chapter Six</t735>
<t736>They worked like slaves for a whole year.</t736> <t737>But they were happy to work like this; because they were aware that whatever they were doing, they were doing it not for the benefit of a handful of idle and thieving people, but for their own benefit and for future generations, they were striving with all their might and silently enduring all kinds of sacrifices.</t737>
<t738>They had worked sixty hours a week throughout the spring and summer.</t738> <t739>When August came, Napoleon announced that they would also work on Sunday afternoons.</t739> <t740>This would be strictly voluntary work, but the ration of any animal who did not come to work would be cut in half.</t740> <t741>Despite this, some tasks had to be abandoned.</t741> <t742>The harvest was not as bountiful as the previous year; two fields had not been sown because they could not be plowed in time.</t742> <t743>One did not need to be a prophet to foresee that the approaching winter would be harsh.</t743>
<t744>The windmill was causing unexpected difficulties.</t744> <t745>There was a large limestone quarry on the farm; sand and cement were found in one of the small buildings; therefore, they had all kinds of construction materials at their disposal.</t745> <t746>But the problem the animals couldn't solve at first was how to break the stones into suitable sizes.</t746> <t747>Chisels and sledgehammers were needed, but the animals couldn't use these tools because they couldn't stand on their hind legs.</t747> <t748>They pondered for weeks and were about to lose hope when someone found a solution: They would take advantage of gravity.</t748> <t749>The quarry was filled with pieces of rock too large to be used without breaking.</t749> <t750>They tied these pieces of rock with ropes; then the cows, horses, sheep, all the animals that could hold the rope â€“ even the pigs in difficult situations â€“ slowly pulled the rocks up to the top of the quarry.</t750> <t751>The rocks they released from there would shatter into pieces below.</t751> <t752>It was easier to transport the stones.</t752> <t753>The carts pulled by the horses were very useful; the sheep dragged the stones one by one; even Muriel and Benjamin contributed by harnessing themselves to an old cart.</t753> <t754>Once enough stones were piled up by the end of summer, construction began under the supervision of the pigs.</t754>
<t755>However, they had given a challenging effort that took a lot of time.</t755> <t756>Lifting a single rock to the top of the quarry often took their entire day and required extraordinary effort.</t756> <t757>Sometimes, the rock rolling down did not break apart.</t757> <t758>If it weren't for Boxer, whose strength was nearly equal to that of all the other animals combined, they might not have been able to manage this task.</t758> <t759>When the animals saw themselves being dragged along with the rock sliding down the hill, they would start to shout desperately, and Boxer would immediately come to the rescue, pulling the rope with all his might to stop the rock.</t759> <t760>The animals watched in admiration as he struggled breathlessly to prevent the rock from sliding, gripping the ground with his hooves, and his broad flanks drenched in sweat.</t760> <t761>Sometimes Clover would warn him not to push himself too hard, but Boxer never listened to her.</t761> <t762>"I will work harder" and "Napoleon is always right" were slogans that, in his eyes, were the cure for all problems.</t762> <t763>He had made an arrangement with the small rooster to wake him up not half an hour, but forty-five minutes early.</t763> <t764>As if all this were not enough, in his now greatly diminished free time, he would go to the quarry alone, collect broken stones, and drag them to the site where the windmill was to be built without any help from anyone.</t764>
<t765>Despite the heaviness of the work, the animals did not have such a bad time that summer.</t765> <t766>Their rations were no more than they had been in Jones's time, but they were certainly no less.</t766> <t767>At the very least, they were no longer feeding five insatiable human beings; the pleasure of only having to feed themselves was so great that they willingly endured the hardships.</t767> <t768>Moreover, the animals' method of working was more efficient in many ways and prevented waste of labor.</t768> <t769>For instance, tasks like weeding were done with a proficiency that humans could never achieve.</t769> <t770>Since no animal now attempted to steal, there was no need to separate the pasture from the fields with fences; this saved the labor that would have been spent on maintaining and repairing the fences and barriers.</t770> <t771>However, as the summer progressed, some unforeseen shortages began to make themselves felt.</t771> <t772>There was a need for kerosene, nails, string, and dog biscuits; iron for horseshoes was also required; moreover, none of these could be produced on the farm.</t772> <t773>Later on, there would be a need for seeds and artificial fertilizers, various tools, and some machinery parts for the windmill.</t773> <t774>No one knew how these would be obtained.</t774>
<t775>One Sunday morning, when they gathered to receive orders, Napoleon announced that he had determined a new policy.</t775> <t776>From now on, Animal Farm would engage in trade with neighboring farms.</t776> <t777>Undoubtedly, not for commercial purposes, but solely to acquire some urgently needed supplies.</t777> <t778>Napoleon said, "The needs of the windmill must be prioritized above everything else."</t778> <t779>Therefore, he was making arrangements to sell a large stack of hay and a portion of that year's wheat crop; later, if more money was needed, eggs, which always had a market in Willingdon, could also be sold.</t779> <t780>According to Napoleon, the hens should see this as their special contribution to the construction of the windmill and should not hesitate to make such a sacrifice.</t780>
<t781>The animals, once again, had become vaguely uneasy.</t781> <t782>Never do business with humans!</t782> <t783>Never engage in trade!</t783> <t784>Never use money!</t784> <t785>Weren't these the first decisions made at the Victory Meeting held after Jones was expelled from the farm?</t785> <t786>All the animals remembered these decisions being approved, or at least they thought they remembered.</t786> <t787>The four little pigs who had protested against Napoleon abolishing the meetings timidly raised their voices, but suddenly fell silent in the face of the dogs' terrifying growls.</t787> <t788>Immediately after, as usual, the sheep began to bleat "Four legs good, two legs bad!" and the tense atmosphere was diffused.</t788> <t789>Soon after, Napoleon raised his foreleg to silence everyone and announced that he had already arranged everything.</t789> <t790>Knowing that it would be extremely problematic for the farm animals to interact with humans, he had decided to create conditions where this would not be necessary.</t790> <t791>He would take all the responsibility himself.</t791> <t792>A lawyer named Mr. Whymper, who lived in Willingdon, had agreed to mediate in the dealings between Animal Farm and the outside world; he would come to the farm every Monday morning to receive instructions from Napoleon.</t792> <t793>After Napoleon, as always, concluded his speech with the cry "Long live Animal Farm!" the animals sang the Beasts of England song and dispersed.</t793>
<t794>Before long, Squealer set about touring the farm to dispel the doubts that had arisen in the animals' minds.</t794> <t795>With a convincing tone, he explained that no decision had ever been made regarding not engaging in trade or using money, and furthermore, that such a proposal had never even been suggested.</t795> <t796>All of this was most likely a figment of the imagination, stemming from the lies Snowball had spread in the early days.</t796> <t797>Noticing that some still harbored doubts, Squealer cunningly asked, "Could this be something you dreamed, comrades?</t797> <t798>Is there any document of such a decision?</t798> <t799>Is it written down anywhere?" Indeed, since there was no such written document to be found, the animals were forced to admit they were mistaken.</t799>
<t800>Mr. Whymper, as previously arranged, visited the farm every Monday.</t800> <t801>Mr. Whymper, a lawyer who dealt with trivial matters, was a small man with sideburns and a mischievous look.</t801> <t802>But he was shrewd enough to realize long before that Animal Farm would eventually need a broker, and that this broker's share would not be insignificant.</t802> <t803>The animals watched his comings and goings with trepidation, avoiding encounters with him as much as possible.</t803> <t804>Nevertheless, seeing the four-legged Napoleon giving orders to the two-legged Whymper stroked their pride and helped them somewhat accept this new situation.</t804> <t805>Their relations with the human race were no longer quite the same.</t805> <t806>The humans' hatred for Animal Farm had not diminished; on the contrary, they hated it more than ever as they saw the farm prospering.</t806> <t807>They all wholeheartedly believed that the farm would eventually go bankrupt and, more importantly, that the windmill project would end in complete failure.</t807> <t808>They gathered in taverns, trying to prove to each other with drawings that the windmill could never be built, and even if it were, it would never work.</t808> <t809>On the other hand, they reluctantly admired the animals' skillful management of their own affairs.</t809> <t810>The fact that they had stopped insisting that the farm's real name was Manor Farm and had started using the name Animal Farm was an indication of this.</t810> <t811>They had also ceased defending Jones, who had lost hope of reclaiming his farm and had moved to another part of the country.</t811> <t812>There was no connection between Animal Farm and the outside world except for Whymper, but there were constant rumors that Napoleon was about to make a concrete business deal either with Mr. Pilkington of Foxwood Farm or Mr. Frederick of Pinchfield Farm, though it was said he would never make a deal with both at the same time.</t812>
<t813>It was around that time that the pigs moved into the farmhouse and made it their residence.</t813> <t814>The animals vaguely remembered that there had been a resolution passed against such behavior, but Squealer once again managed to convince them that this was not the case at all.</t814> <t815>He said that it was absolutely necessary for the pigs, the brains of the farm, to work in a quiet and peaceful place.</t815> <t816>Moreover, for the Leader's (recently, they had started referring to Napoleon as "the Leader") dignity, it was more appropriate for him to live in a house rather than a simple shed.</t816> <t817>Nevertheless, some animals were quite disturbed when they heard that the pigs not only ate their meals in the kitchen and used the living room as a recreation room, but also slept in beds.</t817> <t818>Boxer, as usual, dismissed the situation by saying, "Napoleon is always right!" but Clover, who vaguely remembered a strict law against sleeping in beds, went to the wall of the big barn and tried to read the Seven Commandments written there.</t818> <t819>Seeing that she couldn't make out anything other than individual letters, she called Muriel.</t819>
<t820>"Muriel," he said, "read me the Fourth Commandment.</t820> <t821>Does it say anything about never sleeping in a bed?</t821><t822>"</t822>
<t823>Muriel, who could barely read the writing, said, "No animal shall sleep in a bed with sheets."</t823>
<t824>It was a bit strange; Clover did not remember any mention of sheets in the Fourth Commandment; but since it was written on the wall, there was nothing to be done.</t824> <t825>At that moment, Squealer, who was passing by with two or three dogs, did not delay in clarifying the matter.</t825>
<t826>"Comrades," he said.</t826> <t827>"It seems that you have heard that we pigs are sleeping in the beds of the farmhouse.</t827> <t828>Why shouldn't we?</t828> <t829>I hope you don't think there is a commandment that forbids beds!</t829> <t830>A bed is a place to lie down and sleep.</t830> <t831>In this sense, a pile of straw in the barn is also considered a bed.</t831> <t832>The commandment forbade sheets, which are a human invention.</t832> <t833>We removed the sheets from the beds in the farmhouse and are sleeping with blankets.</t833> <t834>Moreover, the beds are very comfortable!</t834> <t835>But believe me, for those of us who have to think hard about a lot of issues these days, a bed should not be begrudged.</t835> <t836>You wouldn't begrudge us this comfort, would you, comrades?</t836> <t837>Surely you don't want us to be too tired to fulfill our duties.</t837> <t838>I don't think any of you want Jones to come back!</t838><t839>"</t839>
<t840>The animals immediately reassured Squealer on this matter and never brought up the issue of the pigs sleeping in the farmhouse beds again.</t840> <t841>A few days later, when it was announced that the pigs would now get up an hour later than the other animals in the mornings, no one said a word.</t841>
<t842>When autumn came, the animals were tired but happy.</t842> <t843>They had left a difficult year behind.</t843> <t844>Although it couldn't be said that the stock of winter food was abundant after some of the hay and crops were sold, the windmill would make up for this shortfall.</t844> <t845>Nearly half of the construction was completed.</t845> <t846>After the harvest, the weather cleared up, and the animals were working harder than ever, thinking it was worth carrying stones from morning till night, as long as the walls of the windmill rose another inch.</t846> <t847>Boxer didn't even take nights off; he worked alone for an extra hour or two in the light of the full moon.</t847> <t848>In their free time, the animals wandered around the half-built windmill, admiring its solid, towering walls, and were amazed at how they had managed to create such a magnificent structure.</t848> <t849>The only animal who avoided getting enthusiastic about the windmill was old Benjamin; as always, he limited himself to saying cryptic things like, "Donkeys live a long time."</t849>
<t850>November came with strong winds blowing from the southwest.</t850> <t851>They had to stop the construction; it was impossible to mix cement because the weather was too rainy.</t851> <t852>Finally, one night, a storm broke out so violently that the farm buildings shook from their foundations, and tiles flew off the roof of the barn.</t852> <t853>The chickens woke up clucking in fear; they had all heard a gunshot in the distance in the dream they saw at the same time.</t853> <t854>In the morning, they saw that the flagpole had fallen, and one of the elm trees in the orchard had been uprooted like a radish.</t854> <t855>Before they could understand what was happening, all the animals started screaming in terror: The windmill had collapsed.</t855>
<t856>They all rushed together to the windmill.</t856> <t857>Napoleon, who had never been seen even walking briskly, was at the forefront, kicking up dust.</t857> <t858>The windmill, which they had worked so hard to build, was completely destroyed, and the stones they had painstakingly broken and carried were scattered all around.</t858> <t859>They stood there as if struck dumb, staring at the stones scattered around.</t859> <t860>Napoleon was pacing silently, sniffing the ground every now and then, and judging by the rapid swishing of his erect tail, his mind was racing.</t860> <t861>Suddenly, as if he had made up his mind, he stopped.</t861>
<t862>Without raising his voice, he said, "Comrades."</t862> <t863>"Do you know who did this?</t863> <t864>Do you know who the enemy is that came here at night and destroyed our windmill?" Then he suddenly roared: "Snowball! This is Snowball's doing!</t864> <t865>This traitor, just to cause harm, to ruin our plans and take revenge for his disgraceful expulsion, came here under the cover of darkness and destroyed a year's worth of work.</t865> <t866>Comrades, I hereby sentence Snowball to death.</t866> <t867>To the animal who gives him the punishment he deserves, the 'Second Class Animal Hero' medal and half a bucket of apples.</t867> <t868>To the one who brings him back alive, a full bucket of apples!</t868><t869>"</t869>
<t870>The animals, who had never even imagined that Snowball could commit such a crime until that day, were stunned.</t870> <t871>They were growling with anger, calculating how they would catch Snowball if he ever came back.</t871> <t872>Soon after, pig tracks were found among the grass a little further ahead of the small hill.</t872> <t873>The tracks continued for a few meters, apparently leading to a hole in the fence.</t873> <t874>After sniffing for a long time, Napoleon declared that the tracks belonged to Snowball.</t874> <t875>He guessed that Snowball had come from the direction of Foxwood Farm.</t875>
<t876>Napoleon, after examining the footprints, shouted, "Let's not waste time, comrades!"</t876> <t877>"We have a lot of work to do.</t877> <t878>Starting this morning, we will rebuild the windmill.</t878> <t879>We will work through the winter, regardless of snow and mud.</t879> <t880>We will show this lowly traitor that he cannot defeat us so easily.</t880> <t881>Keep in mind, comrades, there should not be the slightest disruption in our plans; all plans must be executed day by day.</t881> <t882>Come on, comrades!</t882> <t883>Long live the windmill!</t883> <t884>Long live Animal Farm!</t884><t885>"</t885>
<t886>Chapter Seven</t886>
<t887>The winter was very harsh.</t887> <t888>After the storms, first came sleet, then snow, and later everything was covered in ice until February.</t888> <t889>The animals were working with all their might, knowing that the entire outside world had its eyes on Animal Farm, and that if the windmill was not completed on time, the envious humans would rejoice.</t889>
<t890>It seems that people do not believe that Snowball destroyed the windmill out of sheer stubbornness; they were saying that the windmill collapsed because its walls were built too thin.</t890> <t891>Although the animals were not unaware that this was not true, it was decided that the walls, which were previously forty-five centimeters thick, would be built ninety centimeters thick this time; this required carrying much more stone.</t891> <t892>Since the quarry remained under snow for a long time, nothing could be done.</t892> <t893>Later, when the weather turned cold and frosty, they started working again, but they were facing great difficulties and were not as hopeful as before.</t893> <t894>They were freezing from the cold and often working on an empty stomach.</t894> <t895>Only Boxer and Clover had not lost their courage.</t895> <t896>Squealer was giving tremendous speeches about the happiness of serving the public and the honor of labor, and Boxer's strength and his constant cry of "I will work harder!" were inciting and motivating the animals.</t896>
<t897>In January, the food supplies began to run out.</t897> <t898>Grain rations were significantly reduced, and it was announced that extra potatoes would be given to make up for the shortfall.</t898> <t899>But soon it was discovered that the potatoes had frozen because they were not sufficiently covered.</t899> <t900>Very few of the potatoes, which had softened and spoiled, were edible.</t900> <t901>For days, they ate nothing but peelings and beets.</t901> <t902>They were now on the brink of starvation.</t902>
<t903>This situation absolutely had to be kept hidden from the outside world.</t903> <t904>Emboldened by the destruction of the windmill, people were inventing new lies about Animal Farm.</t904> <t905>Again, rumors spread that all the animals were being decimated by famine and disease, constantly fighting with each other, that cannibalism was rampant, and that newborns were being slaughtered.</t905> <t906>Napoleon, very well aware of the bad consequences that could arise if the truth about the food situation were known, decided to use Mr. Whymper to create the opposite effect.</t906> <t907>Until that day, the animals either rarely encountered Whymper, who came to the farm every week, or did not encounter him at all.</t907> <t908>However, this time, a group of animals, mostly sheep, were instructed to loiter near Mr. Whymper and, pretending to talk among themselves but loud enough for him to hear, mention that the rations had been increased.</t908> <t909>Napoleon ordered that the nearly empty barrels in the barn be filled with sand and that the sand be covered with the remaining grain and feed.</t909> <t910>Whymper was taken to the barn under some pretext and made to see the barrels, seemingly full to the brim, even if only out of the corner of his eye.</t910> <t911>Falling for Napoleon's trick, Whymper began to spread the word everywhere he went that there was no food shortage at Animal Farm.</t911>
<t912>By the end of January, it became inevitable to get some more grain from somewhere.</t912> <t913>In those days, Napoleon was rarely seen, not stepping outside the farmhouse guarded by ferocious dogs.</t913> <t914>When he did come out, he wandered around with six dogs acting as his bodyguards, not acknowledging anyone, and if anyone got too close, the dogs would immediately growl.</t914> <t915>Napoleon, who no longer attended the Sunday morning meetings, communicated his orders through one of the other pigs, usually Squealer.</t915>
<t916>One Sunday morning, Squealer announced that the hens, who were just about to lay eggs, had to give their eggs to the farm management.</t916> <t917>Napoleon had signed a contract mediated by Whymper; according to the contract, they had to deliver four hundred eggs per week.</t917> <t918>With the money from the eggs, they would buy grain and feed to sustain the farm until summer came and things improved.</t918>
<t919>As soon as the chickens heard the news, they caused a commotion.</t919> <t920>Although they had been warned before that such a sacrifice might be necessary, they honestly never believed it would actually happen one day.</t920> <t921>What else could it be but murder to take the eggs just when they were preparing for the spring hatching?</t921> <t922>For the first time since Jones was expelled from the farm, something resembling a rebellion occurred.</t922> <t923>The chickens, led by three Black Minorca pullets, resolutely opposed Napoleon's command.</t923> <t924>They perched on the roof beams and laid their eggs there, which then fell and broke on the ground.</t924> <t925>Napoleon, undoubtedly, did not delay in taking swift and ruthless measures.</t925> <t926>He not only ordered the chickens' rations to be cut off, but also issued a decree that any animal attempting to give even a bit of food to the chickens would be sentenced to death.</t926> <t927>The dogs would ensure compliance with the orders.</t927> <t928>Although the chickens resisted for about five days, they eventually surrendered and returned to their nests.</t928> <t929>Meanwhile, nine chickens that died were buried in the orchard, and it was said that they had died of bloody diarrhea.</t929> <t930>Whymper was not even aware of what had happened; the eggs were delivered on time, and a cart that came to the farm once a week took the eggs away.</t930>
<t931>Meanwhile, Snowball had not been seen around; rumors had spread that he was hiding in one of the neighboring farms, either at Foxwood or Pinchfield.</t931> <t932>Napoleon's relations with the other farmers had somewhat improved.</t932> <t933>In the yard, there was a large pile of timber that had dried out completely because it had been cut down when a grove of hornbeam trees was cleared about ten years ago.</t933> <t934>Whymper had advised Napoleon to sell them; both Mr. Pilkington and Mr. Frederick were eager to buy the timber, but Napoleon couldn't decide to whom he should sell it.</t934> <t935>When he seemed to be making a deal with Frederick, news would come that Snowball was hiding at Foxwood Farm, and when he seemed to be leaning towards Pilkington, rumors would spread that Snowball was concealed at Pinchfield Farm.</t935>
<t936>It was the early days of spring; suddenly, a piece of news caused a commotion: Snowball was secretly coming to the farm after dark!</t936> <t937>The animals were so anxious that they couldn't sleep at night.</t937> <t938>According to the rumors, Snowball was sneaking into the farm every night under the cover of darkness, causing all sorts of mischief.</t938> <t939>He was stealing the grain, knocking over the milk pails, breaking the eggs, trampling and crushing the seedlings, and gnawing the bark off the fruit trees.</t939> <t940>From then on, whenever something went wrong on the farm, Snowball was immediately blamed.</t940> <t941>If a window broke or a gutter got clogged, it was said that Snowball had come to the farm again at night and done it.</t941> <t942>One day, when the key to the storehouse was lost, the entire farm believed the rumor that Snowball had thrown the key into the well.</t942> <t943>Strangely enough, even when the lost key was found under a sack of flour, the animals did not stop believing in this rumor.</t943> <t944>The cows even claimed that Snowball had secretly entered their barn and milked them in their sleep.</t944> <t945>It was also said that the rats, which had caused a lot of damage to the farm that winter, were in collaboration with Snowball.</t945>
<t946>Deciding that a thorough investigation into Snowball's schemes was necessary, Napoleon took his dogs and began to tour the farm buildings, probing and examining every nook and cranny; the other animals followed him at a respectful distance.</t946> <t947>Claiming that he could find Snowball's trail by scent, Napoleon would stop every few steps to sniff the ground.</t947> <t948>He left no corner of the barn, the cow shed, the henhouses, or the vegetable garden unsniffed and found traces of Snowball almost everywhere.</t948> <t949>Pressing his long snout to the ground and sniffing rapidly, he would then shout in a terrifying voice, "Snowball! He's been here!</t949> <t950>This is his scent!"</t950> <t951>Every time Napoleon shouted "Snowball!", the dogs would bare their teeth and emit blood-curdling growls.</t951>
<t952>The animals were like they were possessed by a demon.</t952> <t953>Snowball seemed to have become invisible, constantly lurking around them, and it was impossible to predict what mischief he might cause next.</t953> <t954>In the evening, Squealer gathered all the animals together and, with a worried tone, said that he had important news.</t954>
<t955>Jumping from place to place nervously, he shouted, "Comrades!"</t955> <t956>"We have received a terrifying piece of news.</t956> <t957>Traitor Snowball has allied with Frederick, the owner of Pinchfield Farm!</t957> <t958>Frederick is planning to attack us and take over our farm!</t958> <t959>When the attack begins, Snowball will guide them.</t959> <t960>There's more.</t960> <t961>We thought Snowball rebelled because of his arrogance and greed.</t961> <t962>But we were wrong, comrades.</t962> <t963>Do you know what the real reason was?</t963> <t964>Snowball was Jones' man from the very beginning!</t964> <t965>He was a secret agent of Jones all along.</t965> <t966>We just captured the documents he left behind, and everything has come to light.</t966> <t967>As far as I'm concerned, everything is as clear as day, comrades.</t967> <t968>Hadn't we already seen with our own eyes the schemes he plotted to defeat us in the Battle of the Cowshed?</t968> <t969>Fortunately, he failed.</t969><t970>"</t970>
<t971>The animals were dumbfounded.</t971> <t972>This was a betrayal much greater than destroying the windmill.</t972> <t973>But as soon as their initial shock passed, they remembered, or seemed to remember, how Snowball had fought bravely at the forefront during the Battle of the Cowshed, how he had rallied and encouraged them when they were about to retreat, and how he had charged forward even when he was wounded by the pellets from Jones's gun.</t973> <t974>It was indeed a bit difficult to reconcile Snowball's heroism in the battle with the idea of him being Jones's secret agent.</t974> <t975>Even Boxer, who rarely asked questions, was confused.</t975> <t976>He lay down, tucked his forelegs under him; he closed his eyes, trying to clear his head.</t976>
<t977>"I don't believe this," he said.</t977> <t978>"Snowball fought like a lion in the Battle of the Cowshed.</t978> <t979>I saw it with my own eyes.</t979> <t980>Didn't we award him the 'Animal Hero, First Class' medal immediately after the battle ended?</t980><t981>"</t981>
<t982>Squealer replied, "We were mistaken, comrade."</t982> <t983>"In fact, he was trying to lead us to ruin; the secret documents we obtained explain everything.</t983><t984>"</t984>
<t985>"But she was injured," said Boxer.</t985> <t986>"We all saw her running around covered in blood.</t986><t987>"</t987>
<t988>"It was a staged fight!" shouted Squealer, jumping up and down.</t988> <t989>"The bullets actually just grazed him.</t989> <t990>If you could read, I would show you his own writing; then you would understand everything.</t990> <t991>All of Snowball's dirty laundry has come out:</t991>
<t992>He was going to find an excuse to give the order to retreat and leave the field to the enemy, and we had no idea.</t992> <t993>He almost succeeded too.</t993> <t994>In fact, comrades, I have no doubt that if it weren't for our brave leader Comrade Napoleon, he would have definitely done it.</t994> <t995>Have you forgotten that when Jones and his men stormed into the yard, Snowball suddenly turned and started to run away, and many animals followed him?</t995> <t996>At that very moment, when we were all panicking and thought the battle was lost, don't you remember how Comrade Napoleon charged forward shouting 'Death to Humanity!' and sank his teeth into Jones' leg?</t996> <t997>You can't have forgotten that, comrades!</t997><t998>"</t998>
<t999>When Squealer described the scene so vividly, the animals almost seemed to remember it.</t999> <t1000>At the very least, they remembered Snowball turning tail and running at the critical moment of the battle.</t1000> <t1001>But there was still a sense of unease in Boxer.</t1001>
<t1002>He finally let the cat out of the bag: "I don't believe Snowball was a traitor from the beginning.</t1002> <t1003>I have nothing to say about what he did later.</t1003> <t1004>But I believe that Snowball acted like a true comrade during the Battle of the Cowshed.</t1004><t1005>"</t1005>
<t1006>Squealer, in a low but determined voice, said, "Look, comrade."</t1006> <t1007>"Our leader Comrade Napoleon has unequivocally, yes unequivocally, revealed that Snowball has been Jones's agent from the very beginning, even before there was any talk of the Rebellion.</t1007><t1008>"</t1008>
<t1009>Upon this, "Ah, then that's different!" said Boxer.</t1009> <t1010>"If Comrade Napoleon says so, then it must be so.</t1010><t1011>"</t1011>
<t1012>Squealer shouted, "Now, this is what I call the spirit of comradeship!"</t1012> <t1013>But it did not go unnoticed that he was glaring at Boxer with his tiny, constantly blinking eyes.</t1013> <t1014>Just as he was about to leave, he suddenly stopped and added in an impressive voice: "I warn all the animals on this farm, keep your eyes wide open.</t1014> <t1015>It is obvious that Snowball's agents are already walking among us freely!</t1015><t1016>"</t1016>
<t1017>Four days later, towards evening, Napoleon ordered all the animals to gather in the yard.</t1017> <t1018>When everyone had gathered, Napoleon appeared with his medals on his chest (some time ago, he had awarded himself both the "First Class Animal Hero" and the "Second Class Animal Hero" medals); nine large dogs were circling around him, growling every now and then, instilling fear in the hearts of all the animals.</t1018> <t1019>As if sensing that something very bad was going to happen, everyone quietly crouched down on the ground.</t1019>
<t1020>Napoleon stood there, scanning the crowd with a stern gaze; then suddenly let out a high-pitched scream.</t1020> <t1021>The dogs, as soon as they heard the scream, leapt forward and grabbed four of the pigs by their ears, dragging the squealing and terrified animals to Napoleon's feet.</t1021> <t1022>Blood was dripping from the pigs' ears, and the dogs, having tasted the blood, went wild.</t1022> <t1023>Suddenly, three of the dogs, to everyone's astonishment, leapt at Boxer.</t1023> <t1024>As soon as Boxer saw them coming, he raised his huge foreleg, caught one of the dogs in mid-air, and slammed it to the ground.</t1024> <t1025>The dog, pinned to the ground, screamed for mercy, while the other two tucked their tails between their legs and ran off.</t1025> <t1026>Boxer's eyes were on Napoleon; should he crush and kill the dog, or let it go?</t1026> <t1027>Napoleon's face was contorted; he ordered Boxer in a harsh voice to release the dog.</t1027> <t1028>Upon this, Boxer lifted his foot off the dog, which then slunk away, whimpering in pain.</t1028>
<t1029>Soon after, the place had calmed down.</t1029> <t1030>The four pigs, whose guilt was written all over their faces, were trembling and waiting.</t1030> <t1031>Napoleon turned to them and asked them to confess their crimes.</t1031> <t1032>These were the pigs who had opposed Napoleon's decision to abolish the Sunday meetings.</t1032> <t1033>Without much resistance, they confessed everything: They had secretly met with Snowball since the day he was expelled from the farm, collaborated in the destruction of the windmill, and had reached an agreement to transfer Animal Farm to Mr. Frederick.</t1033> <t1034>They also did not hesitate to say that Snowball had confessed to them that he had been Jones's secret agent for years.</t1034> <t1035>As soon as their confessions were complete, the dogs leapt upon them and tore their throats out.</t1035> <t1036>Then, Napoleon turned back to the assembly and said in a terrible voice, "If there are any other animals who wish to confess, let them come forward."</t1036>
<t1037>The three hens who had tried to lead the egg rebellion stepped forward and declared that in their dreams, Snowball had urged them to disobey Napoleon's orders.</t1037> <t1038>And at that moment, they were throttled by the dogs.</t1038> <t1039>Then, a goose came forward and confessed that it had secretly eaten six ears of wheat that it had stolen and hidden during the last harvest.</t1039> <t1040>Next, one of the sheep declared that, at Snowball's request, it had urinated in the drinking water.</t1040> <t1041>Two other sheep confessed that they had chased and killed an old ram, known for his loyalty to Napoleon, around the fire while he was having a coughing fit.</t1041> <t1042>They were all slaughtered on the spot.</t1042> <t1043>The confessions and executions continued in this manner.</t1043> <t1044>In the end, they found themselves surrounded by corpses at Napoleon's feet.</t1044> <t1045>The smell of blood filled the air.</t1045> <t1046>Such a smell had not been sensed on the farm since the day Jones was expelled.</t1046>
<t1047>After everything was over, all the animals except the pigs and dogs huddled together and moved away from there.</t1047> <t1048>They had tucked their tails in and were trembling with fear.</t1048> <t1049>They couldn't decide which was more terrifying: the betrayal of the animals who had sided with Snowball, or the ruthless reprisals they had just witnessed?</t1049> <t1050>They had witnessed such bloody massacres before, but at least they weren't slaughtering each other.</t1050> <t1051>Since Jones was expelled, it had never been seen that one animal killed another.</t1051> <t1052>Not even a rat had been killed.</t1052> <t1053>When they reached the small hill where the half-completed windmill stood, they lay down close to each other as if trying to warm up.</t1053> <t1054>Clover, Muriel, Benjamin, the cows, the sheep, the geese, the chickens, everyone was there.</t1054> <t1055>Only the cat, who had suddenly disappeared just before Napoleon ordered all the animals to gather, was not among them.</t1055> <t1056>For a while, no one spoke.</t1056> <t1057>Only Boxer was standing.</t1057> <t1058>He couldn't stay still, kept swaying his long black tail from side to side, and was neighing softly in confusion.</t1058> <t1059>Finally, he said:</t1059>
<t1060>"I can't make sense of what's happening.</t1060> <t1061>Even if I thought for forty years, I wouldn't have imagined such things happening on our farm.</t1061> <t1062>We must have made a mistake.</t1062> <t1063>If you ask me, the only way out is to work harder.</t1063> <t1064>As for me, from now on, I will get up an hour earlier in the mornings.</t1064><t1065>"</t1065>
<t1066>With all his laziness, he started trotting and headed towards the quarry.</t1066> <t1067>When he arrived there, he hauled two loads of stones to the windmill with the cart, and then went to bed.</t1067>
<t1068>The animals had gathered around Clover, and no one could utter a word.</t1068> <t1069>From the hill they were on, they could see the fields stretching out all around.</t1069> <t1070>A large part of Animal Farm was within their view: the pasture extending to the main road, the mown and dried hay, the grove, the trough, the lush, green crops beginning to sprout in the plowed fields, the red roofs of the farm buildings, and the smoking chimneys...</t1070> <t1071>It was a bright spring evening.</t1071> <t1072>The grass and the leaf-budding hedges illuminated by the sun's rays were sparkling.</t1072> <t1073>The farm had never looked so beautiful to their eyes.</t1073> <t1074>Suddenly, they remembered that this was their own farm; every inch of this land was theirs.</t1074> <t1075>As Clover looked down from the hill, her eyes filled with tears.</t1075> <t1076>If she could express her thoughts, she would say that when they set out years ago to overthrow the human race, this was never their goal.</t1076> <t1077>Could the violence and slaughter they now witnessed be what they had envisioned on the night Old Major first called for the Rebellion?</t1077> <t1078>In the future she had imagined, there was a society where animals were free from hunger and the whip, where everyone was equal, everyone worked according to their ability, and the strong protected the weak just as Old Major had embraced the lost ducklings on the night he spoke.</t1078> <t1079>However, for some unknown reason, a society had emerged where no one dared to express their thoughts, wild, savage dogs roamed everywhere growling, and they were forced to watch their comrades being torn apart after confessing to horrific crimes.</t1079> <t1080>But thoughts of rebelling or rising up did not cross her mind.</t1080> <t1081>She knew that even their current situation was much better than it had been in Jones's time and that above all, it was necessary to prevent the humans from returning to the farm.</t1081> <t1082>No matter what, she would remain loyal to the administration, follow the orders given to her to the letter, and accept Napoleon's leadership.</t1082> <t1083>But still, this should not have been the result of so much hope and effort.</t1083> <t1084>Should this be the reward for building the windmill with such difficulty and braving the pellets from Jones's gun?</t1084> <t1085>She thought this way, but she could not put her thoughts into words and express them.</t1085>
<t1086>In the end, thinking it would take the place of the words she couldn't express, Clover began to sing the song of the Beasts of England.</t1086> <t1087>The other animals sitting around her also joined in the song.</t1087> <t1088>They sang the song three times in total, and very beautifully; but it had never been sung so slowly and sadly before.</t1088>
<t1089>They had just finished when Squealer appeared with two dogs; it was clear he had something important to say.</t1089> <t1090>When he came near them, he announced that by a special decree of Comrade Napoleon, the song "Beasts of England" had been abolished.</t1090> <t1091>It was now forbidden to sing "Beasts of England."</t1091>
<t1092>The animals were surprised.</t1092>
<t1093>Muriel shouted, "Why?"</t1093>
<t1094>Squealer, fawningly, said, "There is no longer any need, comrade."</t1094> <t1095>'Beasts of England' was the song of the Rebellion.</t1095> <t1096>The Rebellion is now complete.</t1096> <t1097>This afternoon's execution of the traitors was the final act.</t1097> <t1098>Both the internal and external enemies have been defeated.</t1098> <t1099>In the song 'Beasts of England,' we expressed our longing for a better society to be established in the future.</t1099> <t1100>Now that society has been established, this song no longer has any meaning.</t1100><t1101>"</t1101>
<t1102>Despite being very frightened, some of the animals were preparing to resist, but as usual, the sheep's bleating of "Four legs good, two legs bad!" ended the discussion before it could start.</t1102>
<t1103>From that day on, the song of England's Animals was never heard again.</t1103> <t1104>Instead, the poet Minimus had composed another song.</t1104> <t1105>The song began like this:</t1105>
<t1106>Animal Farm, Animal Farm, believe,</t1106>
<t1107>No harm will ever come to you from me!</t1107>
<t1108>The new song was sung every Sunday after the flag was hoisted.</t1108> <t1109>But for some reason, the animals could not love its melody or lyrics as much as they loved "Beasts of England."</t1109>
<t1110>Chapter Eight</t1110>
<t1111>A few days later, when the terror caused by the executions had subsided, some animals remembered or seemed to remember the Sixth Commandment: "No animal shall kill any other animal."</t1111> <t1112>Although no one dared to speak up in the presence of the pigs or the dogs, everyone was aware that the murders did not comply with this commandment.</t1112> <t1113>Clover asked Benjamin to read the Sixth Commandment to her, but Benjamin, as always, said he did not want to get involved in such matters.</t1113> <t1114>So Clover found Muriel.</t1114> <t1115>Muriel read the Sixth Commandment as follows: "No animal shall kill any other animal without cause."</t1115> <t1116>Apparently, the words without cause had somehow been erased from the animals' memories.</t1116> <t1117>Thus, the Sixth Commandment had not been violated; because the traitors who had conspired with Snowball had not been killed without cause.</t1117>
<t1118>That year, the animals worked much harder than the previous year.</t1118> <t1119>On one hand, the reconstruction of the windmill with walls twice as thick and its completion by the predetermined date, and on the other hand, the daily operations of the farm required an extraordinary effort.</t1119> <t1120>From time to time, the animals began to notice that despite working more than they did during Jones's era, they were not better fed.</t1120> <t1121>On Sunday mornings, Squealer would read out some figures from a long piece of paper he held with his foot, explaining that the production of various foodstuffs had increased by two hundred percent, three hundred percent, five hundred percent.</t1121> <t1122>Since the animals no longer remembered the conditions before the Rebellion accurately, they saw no reason not to believe him.</t1122> <t1123>But still, there were days when they couldn't help but wonder when they would see the days where they listened to fewer numbers and ate more food.</t1123>
<t1124>From now on, all orders were conveyed by Squealer or one of the other pigs.</t1124> <t1125>Napoleon only appeared in public once every fortnight, and when he did, he was accompanied not only by his entourage of dogs but also by a black rooster.</t1125> <t1126>The rooster walked ahead and, like a bugler, crowed as loudly as he could, "Cock-a-doodle-doo!" whenever Napoleon was about to speak.</t1126> <t1127>It was said that Napoleon even stayed in separate rooms from the others in the farmhouse.</t1127> <t1128>While eating his meals alone, two dogs would stand guard beside him; he used the Crown Derby dinner service that once stood in the glass cabinet in the sitting room.</t1128> <t1129>Meanwhile, it was announced that, in addition to the other two anniversaries, Napoleon's birthday would also be celebrated with a ceremonial gunshot.</t1129>
<t1130>No one could simply refer to Napoleon as "Napoleon" anymore; it was required to formally address him as "Our Leader Comrade Napoleon."</t1130><t1131>The pigs were competing with each other to come up with titles for him such as Father of All Animals, Terror of Humans, Protector Angel of the Sheep, and Dear Friend of the Ducklings.</t1131><t1132>Squealer, with tears streaming from his eyes during his speeches, spoke of how wise and kind-hearted an animal Napoleon was, and how deeply he loved all the animals on earth, especially the unhappy animals still living like slaves in the darkness of ignorance on other farms.</t1132><t1133>It had become a habit to attribute every success and every joyous event to Napoleon.</t1133><t1134>It was even heard that a hen said to another hen, "If it weren't for Our Leader Comrade Napoleon, I wouldn't have been able to lay five eggs in six days," and that two cows drinking water from the lake shouted, "Would the lake's water be this sweet without Comrade Napoleon's leadership?"</t1134><t1135>The feelings and thoughts of the animals on the farm about this were echoed in a poem titled "Comrade Napoleon," written by Minimus:</t1135>
<t1136>The one and only father of orphans!</t1136>
<t1137>The fountain of our happiness!</t1137>
<t1138>The sultan of the feed buckets!</t1138>
<t1139>You resemble the sun in the sky,</t1139>
<t1140>With your cold and commanding gaze</t1140>
<t1141>You stir excitement in my heart,</t1141>
<t1142>Comrade Napoleon!</t1142>
<t1143>Everything that His servants love</t1143>
<t1144>You are the one who grants to them,</t1144>
<t1145>Two meals, a perfectly clean straw mattress;</t1145>
<t1146>Every animal, big or small</t1146>
<t1147>Sleeps comfortably every evening,</t1147>
<t1148>You are the one who protects and looks after them,</t1148>
<t1149>Comrade Napoleon!</t1149>
<t1150>If one day I have a child,</t1150>
<t1151>When still a tiny baby</t1151>
<t1152>His height is less than six spans</t1152>
<t1153>One must learn to appreciate your worth,</t1153>
<t1154>As soon as they open their eyes to the world</t1154>
<t1155>The scream that should be pressed with a shriek:</t1155>
<t1156>"Comrade Napoleon!</t1156><t1157>"</t1157>
<t1158>Napoleon approved and endorsed the poem, and had it written on the wall of the big barn, next to the Seven Commandments.</t1158> <t1159>A profile portrait of Napoleon, done by Squealer in white paint, was also hung above the poem.</t1159>
<t1160>Meanwhile, Napoleon had entered into complicated relations with Frederick and Pilkington through Whymper.</t1160> <t1161>The timber was still waiting to be sold.</t1161> <t1162>Although Frederick seemed more eager to buy, he was unwilling to offer a fair price.</t1162> <t1163>Moreover, according to rumors that had begun to circulate again, Frederick was planning to attack Animal Farm with his men and destroy the windmill he was very envious of.</t1163> <t1164>It was also known that Snowball was still hiding at Pinchfield Farm.</t1164>
<t1165>In the middle of summer, the animals were struck with great fear upon hearing that three hens had confessed to participating in a plot to assassinate Napoleon.</t1165> <t1166>The hens were immediately executed, and new measures were taken for Napoleon's safety.</t1166> <t1167>At night, dogs stood guard around his bed, and every meal he ate was first tasted by a young pig named Pinkeye to check if it was poisoned.</t1167>
<t1168>In the same days, it was announced that Napoleon had decided to sell the timber to Mr. Pilkington; furthermore, a suitable agreement was to be made regarding the exchange of some products between Animal Farm and Foxwood Farm.</t1168> <t1169>The relations between Napoleon and Pilkington, although conducted only through Whymper, had now taken on an almost friendly nature.</t1169> <t1170>Although the animals did not trust Pilkington as a human being even a little, they still preferred him over Frederick, whom they both feared and hated.</t1170> <t1171>As summer progressed and the construction of the windmill neared completion, rumors of an imminent and relentless attack on the farm increased.</t1171> <t1172>According to what was said, Frederick had gathered twenty armed men and had already bribed judges and police so that they would not question him when he seized the deeds of Animal Farm.</t1172> <t1173>Moreover, from Pinchfield Farm, chilling information about how cruelly Frederick treated his animals was leaking out.</t1173> <t1174>If true, he had whipped an old horse to death, starved the cows for days, thrown one of the dogs into the furnace; in the evenings, he took pleasure in making roosters fight with sharp razors attached to their spurs.</t1174> <t1175>As the animals heard about what was done to their comrades, they were furious with rage, and from time to time, they asked for permission to attack Pinchfield Farm together and drive out the humans to set the animals free.</t1175> <t1176>Squealer, however, said that if they acted in anger, they would suffer losses, and advised them to trust in Comrade Napoleon's knowledge and experience.</t1176>
<t1177>However, the hatred for Frederick was growing day by day.</t1177> <t1178>One Sunday morning, Napoleon came to the barn and declared that he had never even considered selling the timber to Frederick, as he could not bear the dishonor of dealing with such a vile creature.</t1178> <t1179>The pigeons, which were still being sent to neighboring farms to spread the idea of rebellion, were instructed not to set foot on Foxwood Farm, and they were ordered to abandon the slogan "Death to Humanity" and instead use the slogan "Death to Frederick."</t1179> <t1180>Towards the end of summer, another one of Snowball's schemes was uncovered.</t1180> <t1181>No one could solve the mystery of the weeds that had been plaguing the crops for some time; finally, it was discovered that Snowball had secretly entered the farm one night and mixed weed seeds with the wheat seeds.</t1181> <t1182>A male goose, who had been an accomplice to Snowball, confessed his crime to Squealer and then committed suicide by swallowing poisonous yew berries.</t1182> <t1183>Meanwhile, the animals learned that, contrary to what many had known until that day, Snowball had never received the "Animal Hero, First Class" medal.</t1183> <t1184>Snowball had fabricated this story himself some time after the Battle of the Cowshed.</t1184> <t1185>Far from being rewarded with a medal, he had been condemned for showing cowardice in the battle.</t1185> <t1186>When the animals heard all this, they reacted with great astonishment once again.</t1186> <t1187>But Squealer was quick to calm them down, saying that memory was deceptive.</t1187>
<t1188>The windmill was completed in the autumn; but since the harvest also needed to be gathered around the same time, they were exhausted from fatigue.</t1188> <t1189>The machines had not yet been installed, Whymper was conducting the purchase negotiations; but the construction work was finished.</t1189> <t1190>Despite inexperience, the primitiveness of the tools used, misfortunes, Snowball's betrayal, in short, despite all kinds of difficulties and obstacles, they managed to finish the work on the exact day specified!</t1190> <t1191>The animals, their bodies tired but their hearts full of pride, were circling around the masterpiece they had created, losing themselves as they watched the windmill, which they found much more beautiful than the first one built.</t1191> <t1192>Moreover, this time the walls of the windmill were twice as thick as before.</t1192> <t1193>Nothing but dynamite could destroy these walls!</t1193> <t1194>When they thought about how much effort they had put in, how many disappointments they had overcome, and how different their lives would be once the gears turned and the dynamos worked, their fatigue melted away; they began to hop and skip around the windmill, shouting victory cries.</t1194> <t1195>Shortly after, Napoleon arrived with his dogs and rooster, inspected the windmill, congratulated the animals on their success, and announced that the windmill would henceforth be known as Napoleon Mill.</t1195>
<t1196>Two days later, the animals were called to a special meeting to be held in the barn.</t1196> <t1197>At the meeting, they were stunned when Napoleon announced that he had sold all the timber to Frederick.</t1197> <t1198>The next day, Frederick's carts would come to the farm and start transporting the timber.</t1198> <t1199>Apparently, while Napoleon appeared to be friendly with Pilkington, he had actually already secretly made a deal with Frederick.</t1199>
<t1200>All relations with Foxwood Farm had been cut off, and denunciatory messages were sent to Pilkington.</t1200> <t1201>The pigeons were instructed not to visit Pinchfield Farm and to replace the slogan "Death to Frederick" with "Death to Pilkington."</t1201> <t1202>Meanwhile, Napoleon told the animals that the rumors about an imminent attack on Animal Farm were completely fabricated and that the stories about Frederick mistreating his animals were greatly exaggerated.</t1202> <t1203>All these rumors were most likely spread by Snowball and his agents.</t1203> <t1204>Now everything was clear: Snowball was not hiding at Pinchfield Farm, he had never been there; according to reports, he was living in great luxury at Foxwood Farm and had been serving Pilkington for years.</t1204>
<t1205>The pigs tipped their hats to Napoleon's cunning, who, by appearing to advance his friendship with Pilkington, had managed to get Frederick to pay twelve pounds more for the timber.</t1205> <t1206>But according to Squealer, the real proof of Napoleon's superior intelligence was that he trusted no one, not even Frederick.</t1206> <t1207>Frederick had tried to pay for the timber with a check that was nothing more than a piece of paper promising payment; but Napoleon had outsmarted him, insisting that the payment be made in five-pound banknotes before the timber was moved.</t1207> <t1208>In the end, Frederick had indeed paid the money as demanded; the amount he paid was just enough to purchase the machinery needed for the windmill.</t1208>
<t1209>Meanwhile, the timbers were being transported at great speed.</t1209> <t1210>After all of them were transported, another special meeting was held in the big barn so that the animals could see the banknotes given by Frederick with their own eyes.</t1210> <t1211>Napoleon, who was wearing both of his medals, was grinning carelessly; he was lying on the straw mattress on the elevation; the money, carefully placed in a porcelain bowl brought from the farmhouse kitchen, was right beside him.</t1211> <t1212>The animals slowly passed by and closely examined the money.</t1212> <t1213>When Boxer tried to sniff by extending his nose, the thin banknotes rustled and moved.</t1213>
<t1214>It had not even been three days when the farm was thrown into chaos.</t1214> <t1215>Suddenly, Whymper appeared on his bicycle from down the road; his face was as white as chalk; when he entered the yard, he threw his bicycle aside and rushed into the farmhouse.</t1215> <t1216>Soon, angry roars were heard from the room where Napoleon was staying.</t1216> <t1217>The news spread throughout the farm like an uncontrollable wildfire.</t1217> <t1218>The banknotes had turned out to be fake!</t1218> <t1219>Frederick had swindled the timber!</t1219>
<t1220>Napoleon immediately gathered the animals; in a terrifying voice, he announced that he had sentenced Frederick to death and would have him thrown into a cauldron alive as soon as he was caught.</t1220> <t1221>On the other hand, he also warned the animals to be prepared for the worst situations after Frederick's treachery.</t1221> <t1222>Frederick and his men could launch their long-awaited attack at any moment.</t1222> <t1223>Guards were placed at every possible entry point to the farm.</t1223> <t1224>Four pigeons were also sent to Foxwood Farm with a letter of reconciliation, hoping to re-establish friendly relations with Pilkington.</t1224>
<t1225>The attack began the next morning.</t1225><t1226>The animals were just sitting down to breakfast when the scouts came rushing in, raising dust, and reported that Frederick and his men had entered through the main gate.</t1226><t1227>The animals bravely rushed forward to meet the attackers; but this time, achieving victory did not seem as easy as it had in the Battle of the Cowshed.</t1227><t1228>There were fifteen of them, six of whom had rifles; they opened fire when they were about fifty meters away.</t1228><t1229>The animals, unable to withstand the terrible explosions and the pellets that burned their flesh, soon had to retreat.</t1229><t1230>Napoleon and Boxer tried hard to rally them, but it was to no avail.</t1230><t1231>There were wounded.</t1231><t1232>They had taken refuge in the farm buildings, watching the outside through cracks and knot holes.</t1232><t1233>The large pasture and the windmill had fallen into enemy hands.</t1233><t1234>Even Napoleon was stunned, unsure of what to do.</t1234><t1235>He was silent, pacing the room rapidly with his tail held high.</t1235><t1236>All eyes were on the road to Foxwood Farm.</t1236><t1237>If Pilkington and his men came to help, they might be saved.</t1237><t1238>But just at that moment, the pigeons they had sent out the day before returned.</t1238><t1239>One of them had a note from Pilkington in its beak.</t1239><t1240>The note, written in pencil, read: "Serves you right!</t1240><t1241>"</t1241>
<t1242>In the meantime, Frederick and his men had gathered around the windmill.</t1242> <t1243>The animals, too, were watching them with helpless grumbles.</t1243> <t1244>They saw two men take out a crowbar and a sledgehammer.</t1244> <t1245>They were preparing to demolish the windmill.</t1245>
<t1246>"They can't do anything!" shouted Napoleon.</t1246> <t1247>"Their sledgehammers won't penetrate our thick walls.</t1247> <t1248>Even if they work for a week, they still won't be able to bring them down.</t1248> <t1249>Don't be afraid, comrades!"</t1249>
<t1250>But Benjamin kept his eyes wide open, trying to understand what the men were doing.</t1250> <t1251>Then he saw that the two men were digging a hole near the base of the windmill with a crowbar and a sledgehammer.</t1251> <t1252>He slowly shook his long nose from side to side and smiled knowingly.</t1252> <t1253>"I knew it," he said.</t1253> <t1254>"Can't you see?</t1254> <t1255>Soon they will fill that hole with gunpowder.</t1255><t1256>"</t1256>
<t1257>The animals were waiting in fear.</t1257> <t1258>It was now impossible for them to attempt to leave the buildings they had taken refuge in.</t1258> <t1259>A few minutes later, they saw the men fleeing from the mill.</t1259> <t1260>Immediately after, a deafening roar erupted.</t1260> <t1261>The pigeons flew into the air, and all the animals except Napoleon threw themselves face down on the ground and covered their faces.</t1261> <t1262>When they stood up, the place where the windmill had been was engulfed in thick black smoke.</t1262> <t1263>When the smoke dispersed with the wind, they saw that there was nothing left of the windmill!</t1263>
<t1264>The animals, seeing all their labor blown away, suddenly gained courage.</t1264> <t1265>The anger they felt in the face of this treachery made them forget their earlier fear and despair.</t1265> <t1266>A terrifying cry for revenge rose.</t1266> <t1267>Without waiting for anyone's orders, they all attacked the enemy together.</t1267> <t1268>They no longer cared about the bullets raining down like hail.</t1268> <t1269>A wild, relentless battle ensued.</t1269> <t1270>The men first fired repeatedly, and when the animals got very close, they started hitting them with sticks and thick boots.</t1270> <t1271>A cow, three sheep, and two geese died right there.</t1271> <t1272>Almost everyone was injured.</t1272> <t1273>Even Napoleon, who was directing the operation from behind, had the tip of his tail grazed by a bullet that reached him.</t1273> <t1274>But the men had also suffered significant losses.</t1274> <t1275>Boxer had smashed the heads of three men with his kicks, a cow had gored one in the stomach with its horns, and Jessie and Bluebell had torn another's pants to shreds with their teeth.</t1275> <t1276>The nine dogs who were Napoleon's bodyguards, following their orders, circled around from behind the fence and attacked from the flank with terrifying barks, causing the men to panic.</t1276> <t1277>They realized they were about to be surrounded.</t1277> <t1278>Frederick ordered his men to leave the farm before things got worse.</t1278> <t1279>Soon, the cowardly enemies were fleeing without looking back.</t1279> <t1280>The animals chased the men down to the lower fields; they didn't miss the chance to land a few more kicks as the men tried to get through the barbed wire fence.</t1280>
<t1281>They had won the war, but they were exhausted, covered in blood from head to toe.</t1281> <t1282>Limping, they headed back towards the farm.</t1282> <t1283>Some of them burst into tears upon seeing their fallen comrades lying on the grass.</t1283> <t1284>They stood in respectful silence for a moment where the windmill once stood.</t1284> <t1285>Yes, all their efforts had been in vain, not even a trace of the windmill remained!</t1285> <t1286>Even the foundation of the structure was partially destroyed.</t1286> <t1287>Even if they tried to rebuild, they couldn't gather the stones from the demolished walls.</t1287> <t1288>The explosion had scattered them hundreds of meters away.</t1288>
<t1289>As they approached the farm, they saw Squealer, who had mysteriously disappeared during the war, hopping and skipping towards them.</t1289> <t1290>He was wagging his tail happily, his face shining with joy.</t1290> <t1291>At that moment, a gunshot rang out from the direction of the farm buildings.</t1291>
<t1292>Boxer asked, "What is this?"</t1292>
<t1293>"They are celebrating our victory!" shouted Squealer.</t1293>
<t1294>"What victory?" said Boxer.</t1294> <t1295>His knees were bleeding, he had lost one of his shoes, his hoof was split, and a lot of buckshot had lodged in his hind leg.</t1295>
<t1296>"What do you mean, what victory, comrade?</t1296> <t1297>Didn't we drive the enemy out of our lands, the sacred lands of Animal Farm?</t1297><t1298>"</t1298>
<t1299>"But they blew up the windmill.</t1299> <t1300>We had spent exactly two years building that windmill!</t1300><t1301>"</t1301>
<t1302>"Never mind, don't worry!</t1302> <t1303>We'll make a new one.</t1303> <t1304>If we feel like it, we'll build six more windmills.</t1304> <t1305>You don't seem to realize what a great achievement we've accomplished, comrade!</t1305> <t1306>The land we're standing on was in enemy hands just a moment ago.</t1306> <t1307>But now we've taken back every inch of it; thanks to the leadership of Comrade Napoleon, of course!</t1307><t1308>"</t1308>
<t1309>"So, we have taken back what was already ours," said Boxer.</t1309>
<t1310>Squealer said, "This victory is ours."</t1310>
<t1311>They limped into the courtyard.</t1311> <t1312>The pellets in his leg were causing Boxer pain.</t1312> <t1313>As he thought about how arduous the task of rebuilding the windmill would be and how much responsibility would fall on him, he felt old for perhaps the first time; he realized that his massive muscles were no longer as strong as they used to be.</t1313>
<t1314>The other animals, after seeing the green flag waving, hearing the gun fired exactly seven times, and listening to Napoleon's speech congratulating them for their bravery in the battle, felt that they had indeed achieved a great victory.</t1314> <t1315>Those who died in the battle were buried with a solemn ceremony.</t1315> <t1316>The cart used as a hearse was pulled by Boxer and Clover, and Napoleon walked at the front of the funeral procession.</t1316> <t1317>The celebrations lasted for a full two days.</t1317> <t1318>Songs were sung, speeches were made, guns were fired; as a reward, each animal was given an apple, each bird fifty grams of millet, and each dog three biscuits.</t1318> <t1319>It was then announced that this last battle would henceforth be known as the "Battle of the Windmill," that Napoleon had decided to establish a new decoration called the "Green Flag," and that he had awarded the first decoration to himself.</t1319> <t1320>The euphoria of victory had made them forget the counterfeit banknotes.</t1320>
<t1321>A few days later, the pigs found a case of whiskey in the cellar of the farmhouse.</t1321> <t1322>Apparently, they hadn't noticed it when they first entered the house.</t1322> <t1323>That night, songs rose from the farmhouse; moreover, everyone was very surprised that tunes from "Beasts of England" occasionally mixed in.</t1323> <t1324>Around half-past nine, Napoleon came out the back door wearing Mr. Jones's bowler hat, circled around the yard, and went back inside.</t1324> <t1325>By morning, a deep silence reigned in the farmhouse.</t1325> <t1326>Apparently, all the pigs were still sleeping.</t1326> <t1327>Around nine, Squealer appeared at the door; he moved slowly; he looked exhausted, his gaze was blank, his tail hung down; he seemed as if he had caught an incurable disease.</t1327> <t1328>He immediately gathered the animals.</t1328> <t1329>The news was bad: Comrade Napoleon was on his deathbed!</t1329>
<t1330>A cry arose from the animals.</t1330> <t1331>Straw was spread in front of the doors of the farmhouse; everyone was walking on tiptoe.</t1331> <t1332>They were lamenting, saying, "What will become of us if we lose our leader?"</t1332> <t1333>There was a rumor going around that Snowball had finally managed to poison Napoleon's food.</t1333> <t1334>At eleven o'clock, Squealer came out in front of the door to make another announcement.</t1334> <t1335>Comrade Napoleon, on his deathbed, had issued one last decree: Those who drank alcohol would be sentenced to death.</t1335>
<t1336>However, Squealer, who reported that Napoleon seemed a bit better towards the evening, announced the next morning that the Leader's health had rapidly improved.</t1336> <t1337>It was learned that Napoleon, who returned to his duties that evening, sent Whymper to Willingdon Farm the next day to purchase some booklets on fermentation and distillation methods.</t1337> <t1338>About a week later, Napoleon ordered the plowing of the small meadow at the back of the orchard, which was intended to be set aside as pasture for animals that could no longer work.</t1338> <t1339>Although it was said that the meadow had deteriorated and needed to be reseeded with grass, it soon became clear that Napoleon intended to plant barley there.</t1339>
<t1340>It was precisely during those days that something strange, which no one could understand, happened.</t1340> <t1341>One night, around midnight, all the animals rushed outside upon hearing a crackling noise coming from the courtyard.</t1341> <t1342>It was a moonlit night.</t1342> <t1343>At the foot of the long wall of the large barn where the Seven Commandments were written, a ladder split into two pieces was lying.</t1343> <t1344>Squealer was also lying on the ground beside the ladder; he looked dazed.</t1344> <t1345>A little further away, a lantern, a paintbrush, and a knocked-over can of white paint were noticeable.</t1345> <t1346>The dogs immediately surrounded Squealer, and as soon as he was able to walk a little, they took him to the farmhouse.</t1346> <t1347>No one could make sense of this incident.</t1347> <t1348>Only old Benjamin, who was nodding his head wisely, seemed to understand everything, but he said nothing.</t1348>
<t1349>But a few days later, while Muriel was reading the Seven Commandments once again on her own, she noticed that the animals had misremembered another of the commandments.</t1349> <t1350>They knew the Fifth Commandment as "No animal shall drink alcohol!" which meant they had forgotten a word.</t1350> <t1351>The correct version was: "No animal shall drink alcohol to excess.</t1351><t1352>"</t1352>
<t1353>Ninth Chapter</t1353>
<t1354>It took a long time for Boxer's split hoof to heal.</t1354> <t1355>They had started rebuilding the windmill the day after the victory celebrations ended.</t1355> <t1356>Boxer had not agreed to take a single day off; he saw it as a matter of honor not to show anyone that he was in pain, and he only confessed to Clover in the evenings that his hoof hurt a lot.</t1356> <t1357>Clover was trying to heal Boxer's wound with poultices she prepared by chewing various herbs.</t1357> <t1358>Clover and Benjamin were begging Boxer not to overexert himself.</t1358> <t1359>Clover would say, "Horses get tired too," but Boxer wouldn't listen: He now had only one goal left, and that was to see the windmill working before he retired.</t1359>
<t1360>In the beginning, when the laws of Animal Farm were first being drafted, the retirement age was set at twelve for horses and pigs, fourteen for cows, nine for dogs, seven for sheep, and five for chickens and geese.</t1360> <t1361>It was decided that the retirement pensions would be kept high.</t1361> <t1362>Although no animal had yet retired, this topic had recently become more and more discussed.</t1362> <t1363>After the small meadow at the back of the orchard was allocated for barley cultivation, there was a rumor that a corner of the large meadow would be fenced off and used as pasture for animals that were due to retire; it was said that retired horses should be given two and a half kilos of grain per day, seven and a half kilos of hay in winter, and on holidays, a carrot or, if possible, an apple.</t1363> <t1364>Boxer would turn twelve towards the end of next summer.</t1364>
<t1365>The hardships of life seemed never-ending.</t1365> <t1366>This winter was as cold as the previous one, and food supplies had dwindled even further.</t1366> <t1367>Except for the rations of the pigs and dogs, all other rations had been cut once.</t1367> <t1368>According to Squealer's explanation, very strict equality in rations was against the principles of Animalism; it might seem like there was a food shortage, but the reality was far from it.</t1368> <t1369>Squealer was very good at soothing hearts.</t1369> <t1370>Undoubtedly, for now, they had to readjust the rations (Squealer never used the word "cut," preferring to say "readjustment"), but compared to Jones's era, there was still a significant improvement.</t1370> <t1371>Reading the numbers in a high-pitched voice and quickly, he demonstrated that compared to Jones's era, they ate more oats, more hay, and more turnips, worked fewer hours, had better quality drinking water, lived longer, saw a significant reduction in the number of dead offspring, had more straw in the barns, and were less infested with fleas.</t1371> <t1372>The animals believed whatever he said.</t1372> <t1373>To be honest, what happened during Jones's time had almost entirely faded from their memories.</t1373> <t1374>They knew that nowadays they lived a poor and harsh life, often going hungry and freezing from the cold, spending every minute working except for sleeping.</t1374> <t1375>But they believed that the old days were even worse and took solace in that.</t1375> <t1376>Moreover, as Squealer constantly emphasized, although they were slaves in the past, they were now free; and that was the main difference.</t1376>
<t1377>The number of mouths to feed had also increased.</t1377> <t1378>In the fall, four sows had given birth to a total of thirty-one piglets around the same time.</t1378> <t1379>Since the only male pig on the farm was Napoleon, it was not hard to guess who the father of the spotted piglets was.</t1379> <t1380>It was announced that a classroom would be built in the garden of the farmhouse when bricks and timber were obtained in the future.</t1380> <t1381>But for now, Napoleon himself was teaching the young pigs in the kitchen of the farmhouse.</t1381> <t1382>They would go out to the garden for physical education and walks, but they were not allowed to play with the other animals' offspring.</t1382> <t1383>Around that time, new rules were introduced: When a pig and another animal met on the road, the other animal would step aside to let the pig pass, and all pigs would have the privilege of wearing green ribbons on their tails on Sundays.</t1383>
<t1384>That year, although things were going well on the farm, they were still experiencing financial difficulties.</t1384> <t1385>They had to buy bricks, sand, and lime for the classroom and save money for the windmill's machinery.</t1385> <t1386>Additionally, they needed to buy kerosene and candles for the house, and sugar for Napoleon's table (he had banned sugar for the other pigs to prevent them from getting fat); tools, nails, string, coal, wire, scrap iron, and dog biscuits were also necessary.</t1386> <t1387>Some of the hay and potatoes had been sold; since the number of eggs in the contract had been increased to six hundred per week, the hens had not been able to hatch enough chicks that year.</t1387> <t1388>In February, the rations, which had been reduced in December, were restricted again, and lanterns were banned in the barns to save kerosene.</t1388> <t1389>But the pigs were comfortable; in fact, it could even be said that they were getting fatter.</t1389> <t1390>Towards the end of February, one evening, a warm, delicious, appetizing smell that the animals had never smelled before spread into the yard from the small brewery behind the kitchen, which had never been used during Jones's time.</t1390> <t1391>One of the animals said that it was the smell of barley being cooked.</t1391> <t1392>The hungry animals, inhaling the smell, couldn't help but wonder if a hot mash was being prepared for dinner.</t1392> <t1393>But far from a hot mash, it was announced the next Sunday that all the barley would be reserved for the pigs.</t1393> <t1394>Barley had already been planted in the field behind the orchard.</t1394> <t1395>Soon, a rumor spread: Each pig was now being given half a liter of beer a day, and Napoleon was receiving four liters, drinking his beer from the soup bowl of the Crown Derby set.</t1395>
<t1396>Although the difficulties never ceased, the animals consoled themselves to some extent by thinking that they now lived much more honorably than before.</t1396> <t1397>More songs were sung, more speeches were made, and more ceremonies were held.</t1397> <t1398>Napoleon had ordered Spontaneous Demonstrations to be held once a week to celebrate the struggles and victories achieved on Animal Farm.</t1398> <t1399>At the designated time, the animals would stop working and march around the farm in military formation: pigs at the front, followed by horses, then cows, sheep, and finally poultry at the back...</t1399> <t1400>The dogs would walk on either side of the parade, and Napoleon's black rooster would lead the way.</t1400> <t1401>Boxer and Clover always carried a flag bearing the image of a hoof and horn, with the words "Long live Comrade Napoleon!"</t1401> <t1402>Afterwards, poems written in honor of Napoleon were read, followed by Squealer giving a speech detailing the latest increases in food production, and occasionally a gun would be fired.</t1402> <t1403>The greatest enthusiasts of the Spontaneous Demonstrations were the sheep; if any animal tried to complain that they were wasting time and doing nothing but standing in the cold (some animals did indeed complain when the pigs and dogs were not around), the sheep would immediately silence them by bleating "Four legs good, two legs bad!" at the top of their lungs.</t1403> <t1404>But generally, the animals enjoyed these ceremonies.</t1404> <t1405>After all, the reminder that they were their own masters and worked only for their own benefit was heartening.</t1405> <t1406>Thus, with the songs, parades, Squealer's statistics, the gun's roar, the rooster's crowing, and the flag's fluttering, they could occasionally forget their hunger.</t1406>
<t1407>In April, a Republic was declared at Animal Farm.</t1407> <t1408>It was necessary to elect a president.</t1408> <t1409>Napoleon, the only candidate, was unanimously elected president.</t1409> <t1410>On the same day, it was announced that new documents had been found revealing detailed information about Snowball being an accomplice of Jones.</t1410> <t1411>The documents showed that Snowball not only resorted to war tricks to lose the Battle of the Cowshed, as the animals initially thought, but also openly</t1411>
<t1412>It revealed that he fought on Jones's side.</t1412> <t1413>Moreover, he had taken command of the Human forces and launched an attack, shouting "Long live Humanity!"</t1413> <t1414>Those who remembered seeing the wounds on Snowball's back with their own eyes were learning something entirely new: It turned out that Napoleon had inflicted those wounds with his teeth.</t1414>
<t1415>The raven Moses, who had not been seen for years, suddenly returned to the farm in the middle of summer.</t1415> <t1416>He had hardly changed; he did not lift a finger, and as before, he kept telling tales of the Sugarcandy Mountain.</t1416> <t1417>He perched on a stump, flapped his black wings, and if he found someone to listen, he would talk for hours.</t1417> <t1418>Pointing to the sky with his big beak, he would say in a very serious voice, "It's there, comrades."</t1418> <t1419>"Sugarcandy Mountain, the land where we poor animals shall be free from all our troubles and live in peace forever, is there, just behind that black cloud you see!" Moreover, he claimed that one day, while flying very high, he had passed by it and seen with his own eyes the clover fields stretching as far as the eye could see, and the hedges covered with linseed cakes and lumps of sugar.</t1419> <t1420>Many of the animals believed him.</t1420> <t1421>They lived in hunger and deprivation in this world; what could be more true or understandable than the existence of a better world elsewhere?</t1421> <t1422>The real puzzle was the pigs' attitude towards Moses.</t1422> <t1423>They both ridiculed him, saying that his tales of Sugarcandy Mountain were lies, and yet they allowed him to stay on the farm without working, even letting him drink beer every day.</t1423>
<t1424>After Boxerâ€™s leg healed, he began to work harder than ever.</t1424> <t1425>In fact, that year, all the animals were working like slaves.</t1425> <t1426>Besides the daily farm work and the rebuilding of the windmill, a classroom for the young pigs had also begun to be built in March.</t1426> <t1427>Eating less and working more was unbearable, but Boxer never gave up.</t1427> <t1428>It was impossible to tell from his speech or his work that he was no longer as strong as he used to be.</t1428> <t1429>Only his appearance had changed a bit; his coat was no longer as shiny, and his massive haunches had sunken in.</t1429> <t1430>Everyone was saying, "Once the spring grass grows, Boxer will recover."</t1430> <t1431>The spring grass grew, but Boxer did not recover.</t1431> <t1432>Sometimes, on the slope leading to the quarry, when his muscles trembled under a large piece of rock, the only thing keeping him standing was his determination.</t1432> <t1433>In such situations, despite having completely lost his voice, the words "I will work harder" could be read from his lips.</t1433> <t1434>Clover and Benjamin constantly warned him to take care of his health, but Boxer did not listen.</t1434> <t1435>His twelfth birthday was approaching.</t1435> <t1436>He did not care about his health; his only wish was to gather enough stones for the windmill before he retired.</t1436>
<t1437>One summer evening, a rumor suddenly spread on the farm: Something had happened to Boxer.</t1437> <t1438>He had tried to carry a load of stones for the windmill all by himself.</t1438> <t1439>The rumor was undoubtedly true.</t1439> <t1440>Soon after, two pigeons hurriedly brought the news: "Boxer has collapsed!</t1440> <t1441>He can't get up!</t1441><t1442>"</t1442>
<t1443>Almost half of the animals on the farm ran to the small hill where the windmill was located.</t1443> <t1444>Boxer was there, lying between the shafts of the cart, stretching his neck, unable to even lift his head.</t1444> <t1445>His eyes were glassy, and his body was drenched in sweat from head to toe.</t1445> <t1446>A thin stream of blood was oozing from his mouth.</t1446> <t1447>Clover knelt down beside him.</t1447>
<t1448>"Boxer!" he shouted.</t1448> <t1449>"What happened to you?</t1449><t1450>"</t1450>
<t1451>Boxer, in a barely audible voice, said, "My lungs gave out."</t1451> <t1452>"No matter.</t1452> <t1453>You can finish the windmill without me."</t1453> <t1454>A lot of stones have been collected.</t1454> <t1455>And I only had a month left.</t1455> <t1456>Honestly, I was eagerly looking forward to my retirement.</t1456> <t1457>Benjamin has aged too; maybe they'll retire him as well, and he can keep me company.</t1457><t1458>"</t1458>
<t1459>Clover said, "We must ask for help immediately."</t1459> <t1460>"Run, inform Squealer."</t1460><t1461>"</t1461>
<t1462>The animals all ran together to the farmhouse to tell Squealer what had happened.</t1462> <t1463>Only Clover and Benjamin stayed behind; Benjamin lay down beside Boxer, swatting flies away with his long tail.</t1463> <t1464>About fifteen minutes later, Squealer appeared; he looked sad and worried.</t1464> <t1465>He said that Comrade Napoleon had learned with great sorrow what had happened to one of the farm's most loyal workers and was trying to arrange for Boxer to be sent to the hospital in Willingdon for treatment.</t1465> <t1466>The animals felt a bit uneasy.</t1466> <t1467>Until that day, no animal except Mollie and Snowball had ever left the farm; they did not like the idea of their sick comrade being handed over to humans.</t1467> <t1468>But Squealer did not delay in calming them down: the veterinarian in Willingdon could treat Boxer much better.</t1468> <t1469>About half an hour later, Boxer recovered a bit and got up with difficulty; he hobbled to his stall and lay down on the straw bed that Clover and Benjamin had prepared.</t1469>
<t1470>Boxer stayed in his stable for two days.</t1470> <t1471>The pigs had sent a large medicine bottle they found in the bathroom medicine cabinet.</t1471> <t1472>Clover was giving Boxer the pink medicine from the bottle twice a day after meals.</t1472> <t1473>In the evenings, Clover stayed in Boxer's stable and talked with him, while Benjamin shooed away the flies.</t1473> <t1474>Boxer said he was not upset about what had happened to him.</t1474> <t1475>If he could recover, he could live at least three more years and spend peaceful days in a corner of the large pasture.</t1475> <t1476>Perhaps for the first time in his life, he would be able to take time to read and learn something.</t1476> <t1477>He was thinking of dedicating his final years to learning the entire alphabet.</t1477>
<t1478>However, Benjamin and Clover could only look after Boxer after working hours.</t1478> <t1479>When a covered cart came to take Boxer away, it was noon.</t1479> <t1480>The animals, who were weeding the turnip field under the supervision of a pig, were very surprised to see Benjamin galloping from the direction of the farm buildings, braying at the top of his lungs.</t1480> <t1481>They were seeing Benjamin agitated for the first time in their lives; in fact, no one had ever seen him gallop until that day.</t1481> <t1482>"Quick! Quick!" shouted Benjamin.</t1482> <t1483>"Come at once! They're taking Boxer away!" The animals, disregarding the pig, left their work and ran towards the farm buildings.</t1483> <t1484>Indeed, in the yard, there was a large covered cart with two horses.</t1484> <t1485>On the side of the cart, there was a writing, and on the driver's seat sat a man with a bowler hat and a devilish look.</t1485> <t1486>Boxer's stall was empty.</t1486>
<t1487>The animals had surrounded the car and were all shouting together, "Goodbye, Boxer!"</t1487> <t1488>"Safe travels!</t1488><t1489>"</t1489>
<t1490>But Benjamin was leaping around them and stamping the earth with his small hoofs. "Fools!</t1490> <t1491>Fools!" he shouted.</t1491> <t1492>"Do you not see what is written on the side of that van?</t1492> <t1493>Do you not see what they are doing?</t1493><t1494>"</t1494>
<t1495>The animals who heard Benjamin paused; a silence enveloped the surroundings.</t1495> <t1496>Muriel was trying to decipher the writing.</t1496> <t1497>Benjamin pushed her aside and read the writing in the midst of the deathly silence:</t1497>
<t1498>"Alfred Simmonds, Horse Slaughterer and Glue Boiler, Willingdon.</t1498> <t1499>Dealer in Hides and Bone-Meal.</t1499> <t1500>Dog Kennels Supplied.</t1500> <t1501>Do you understand now?</t1501> <t1502>They're taking Boxer to the horse slaughterer, they're going to make dog food out of him!</t1502><t1503>"</t1503>
<t1504>The animals screamed in terror.</t1504> <t1505>At that moment, the man sitting in the driver's seat whipped the horses, and the carriage, pulled by the trotting horses, exited the courtyard.</t1505> <t1506>All the animals, making a tremendous noise, followed behind the carriage.</t1506> <t1507>Clover was leading the way with all her might.</t1507> <t1508>The carriage began to speed up.</t1508> <t1509>Although Clover tried to break into a gallop with her strong legs, she could only manage a canter.</t1509> <t1510>"Boxer!" she was shouting.</t1510> <t1511>"Boxer! Boxer! Boxer!" Just then, as if he had heard the commotion outside, Boxer's face appeared in the small window at the back of the carriage.</t1511>
<t1512>Clover cried out, "Boxer!" in a heart-wrenching voice.</t1512> <t1513>"Boxer! Get out of there!</t1513> <t1514>Get out quickly!</t1514> <t1515>They're taking you to be slaughtered!</t1515><t1516>"</t1516>
<t1517>The animals were also shouting, "Get out of there, Boxer! Throw yourself out!"</t1517> <t1518>But the cart had picked up speed and was getting farther away.</t1518> <t1519>It was unclear whether Boxer understood what Clover was saying.</t1519> <t1520>But soon his face disappeared from the window, and terrible thumping sounds were heard from inside the cart.</t1520> <t1521>He was trying to kick open the door.</t1521> <t1522>In the past, he would have shattered the cart door with a few kicks.</t1522> <t1523>But not anymore!</t1523> <t1524>The strength he once had was long gone.</t1524> <t1525>After a while, the thumping gradually weakened and finally stopped altogether.</t1525> <t1526>Desperate, the animals this time called out to the horses pulling the cart: "Comrades! Comrades! Don't take your brother to his death!" But the stupid horses, not understanding what was happening, laid their ears back and sped up a little more.</t1526> <t1527>Boxer's face did not appear at the window again.</t1527> <t1528>One of them thought of running ahead to close the farm gate, but it was too late; the cart passed through the gate and quickly disappeared from sight.</t1528> <t1529>They never saw Boxer again.</t1529>
<t1530>The news came three days later that Boxer had died in the hospital at Willingdon despite all the care shown.</t1530> <t1531>Squealer, who announced the news, said he was with Boxer in his final moments.</t1531>
<t1532>Squealer, lifting his foreleg to wipe away his tears, said, "I have never seen such a touching scene!"</t1532> <t1533>"I was by his side until the very end.</t1533> <t1534>He no longer had the strength to speak.</t1534> <t1535>With his last breath, he whispered in my ear that his only regret was not being able to see the windmill completed.</t1535> <t1536>'Forward, comrades!' he said with difficulty.</t1536> <t1537>'Forward in the name of the Rebellion!</t1537> <t1538>Long live Animal Farm! Long live Comrade Napoleon! Napoleon is always right!</t1538><t1539>' These were his last words, comrades.</t1539><t1540>"</t1540>
<t1541>Then, Squealer's demeanor suddenly changed.</t1541> <t1542>He paused for a moment, cast suspicious glances around with his tiny eyes, and then began to speak.</t1542>
<t1543>After Boxer was taken away, he had heard that a ridiculous and vile rumor had spread on the farm.</t1543> <t1544>According to the rumor, some animals had seen "Horse Slaughterer" written on the cart that took Boxer away and immediately concluded that Boxer was being sent to be slaughtered.</t1544> <t1545>It was unbelievable that an animal could be so stupid.</t1545> <t1546>He was pacing back and forth, shouting angrily.</t1546> <t1547>Did they not know their beloved Leader Comrade Napoleon at all?</t1547> <t1548>Would Comrade Napoleon ever allow such a thing?</t1548> <t1549>Yet the truth was very simple.</t1549> <t1550>The cart, which had once been used by a horse slaughterer, had been bought by the veterinarian a short while ago, but the veterinarian had not had time to erase the writing on the cart.</t1550> <t1551>This was where the problem stemmed from.</t1551>
<t1552>The animals, once they learned the truth, felt a bit relieved from the distress in their hearts.</t1552> <t1553>Especially when Squealer detailed how much care was given to Boxer on his deathbed, how Napoleon had immediately ordered those expensive medicines without the slightest hesitation, their last doubts were dispelled; the thought that Boxer had at least died happily alleviated the pain that had settled in their hearts with the death of their comrade.</t1553>
<t1554>On the next Sunday, Napoleon attended the meeting held in the morning and delivered a short speech extolling Boxer.</t1554> <t1555>It had not been possible to bring the body of their comrade, whose loss they felt deeply, to the farm for burial.</t1555> <t1556>But he had sent a large wreath made of laurel branches for Boxer's funeral, which was to be held in the garden of the farmhouse.</t1556> <t1557>The pigs were going to organize a memorial feast for Boxer in a few days.</t1557> <t1558>Napoleon ended his speech with Boxer's two favorite maxims: "I will work harder" and "Comrade Napoleon is always right."</t1558> <t1559>Every animal should engrave these maxims in their minds.</t1559>
<t1560>On the day of the feast, a grocer's cart from Willingdon left a huge crate at the farmhouse.</t1560> <t1561>That night, loud singing was heard, followed by sounds of scuffling and fighting, and finally, around eleven, a crash.</t1561> <t1562>Until noon the next day, there was no sound from any of those who had stayed in the farmhouse.</t1562> <t1563>A rumor was circulating on the farm: The pigs, having somehow found the money, had bought another case of whiskey.</t1563>
<t1564>Tenth Chapter</t1564>
<t1565>Years passed, seasons changed, and the short lives of the animals came to an end one by one.</t1565> <t1566>Now, apart from Clover, Benjamin, the raven Moses, and a few pigs, no one remembered the days before the Rebellion.</t1566>
<t1567>Muriel had died, Bluebell, Jessie, and Pincher had died.</t1567> <t1568>Jones was no longer alive either; he had passed away in a distant home for the elderly.</t1568> <t1569>Snowball had been forgotten.</t1569> <t1570>Except for a few animals who had known him, Boxer had also been forgotten.</t1570> <t1571>Clover had aged and grown fat; her joints had stiffened, and her eyes had begun to water.</t1571> <t1572>She had been due for retirement for two years, but no animal had ever been seen to retire up to that day.</t1572> <t1573>The plan to set aside a corner of the pasture for the aging animals had long since ceased to be mentioned.</t1573> <t1574>Napoleon had become an almost three hundred-pound boar.</t1574> <t1575>Squealer had turned into a ball of fat; his eyes were so squinty that he could barely see.</t1575> <t1576>Only old Benjamin had hardly changed; only a bit of gray had appeared in his mane; and after Boxer's death, he had become even more morose and taciturn.</t1576>
<t1577>Although the population increase was not as high as initially expected, the number of animals on the farm had still grown.</t1577> <t1578>For many animals born in recent years, the Rebellion was nothing more than a tale passed down by word of mouth; the animals purchased from outside had not even heard of the Rebellion until they arrived at the farm.</t1578> <t1579>Besides Clover, there were three more horses on the farm.</t1579> <t1580>They were animals with pure hearts, honest, and hardworking; their companionship was impeccable, but they were very stupid.</t1580> <t1581>They could not get past the letter B of the alphabet.</t1581> <t1582>They accepted everything they were told about the Rebellion and the basic principles of animalism without question; especially if it came from the mouth of Clover, whom they deeply respected...</t1582> <t1583>But it could not be said that they understood much of what was being told.</t1583>
<t1584>The farm had now become richer and better organized; it had grown even larger with the addition of two fields purchased from Mr. Pilkington.</t1584> <t1585>The windmill had finally been successfully completed, the farm had acquired a threshing machine, a hay and straw barn, and new buildings had been constructed.</t1585> <t1586>Whymper had bought himself a small one-horse carriage.</t1586> <t1587>But the windmill had never been used for generating electricity.</t1587> <t1588>The mill, used for grinding flour, was bringing in quite a good amount of money.</t1588> <t1589>Now the animals were working with all their might to build another windmill.</t1589> <t1590>According to what was being said, once this new windmill was completed, dynamos would be installed.</t1590> <t1591>However, the dreams that Snowball once vividly described to the animals, such as barns illuminated by electric light, with hot and cold water, and working only three days a week, had now faded from memory.</t1591> <t1592>Napoleon had declared that such ideas were incompatible with the spirit of Animalism.</t1592> <t1593>According to the Leader, true happiness lay in working hard and living simply.</t1593>
<t1594>In the meantime, the farm had become richer, but for some reason, the living conditions of the animals had not changed; except for the pigs and dogs, of course.</t1594> <t1595>This was perhaps partly due to their being numerous.</t1595> <t1596>Indeed, they were working in their own way.</t1596> <t1597>According to what Squealer tirelessly explained, the supervision and management of the farm required them to work incessantly.</t1597> <t1598>Most of these tasks were beyond the knowledge and skills of the other animals.</t1598> <t1599>For instance, the pigs had to rack their brains every day from morning till night over things like "vouchers," "reports," "minutes," and "files," which no one could make heads or tails of.</t1599> <t1600>These were sheets of paper filled with dense writing, which, once filled, were thrown into the fire and burned.</t1600> <t1601>Squealer said that this was of great importance for the peace and order of the farm.</t1601> <t1602>But still, neither the pigs nor the dogs produced food with their own labor; moreover, they were both very numerous and always had a good appetite.</t1602>
<t1603>As for the other animals; as far as they could see, not much had changed in their lives.</t1603> <t1604>Most of the time they were hungry, sleeping on the straw, drinking their water from the puddle, working in the fields; freezing in the winter, and being attacked by flies in the summer.</t1604> <t1605>The older ones, straining their memories, were trying to figure out whether the situation in the early days of the Rebellion, when Jones had just been expelled from the farm, was better or worse than now; but they couldn't remember much.</t1605> <t1606>They had nothing left to compare their current lives with; all they had were Squealer's lists filled with figures showing that the situation was improving day by day.</t1606> <t1607>They couldn't make sense of it; besides, they no longer had the time to ponder such things at length.</t1607> <t1608>The only animal who claimed to remember all the details of his long life was old Benjamin; he said that the situation had never been better or worse and that it would continue like this.</t1608> <t1609>According to Benjamin, hunger, hardship, and disappointment were the unchanging laws of life.</t1609>
<t1610>However, the animals never lost their hope.</t1610> <t1611>More importantly, they never forgot for a moment how honorable and respectable it was to be a member of Animal Farm.</t1611> <t1612>Animal Farm was still the only farm in the whole country â€“ in all of England! â€“ that was owned by animals and managed by animals.</t1612> <t1613>Even the youngest, and those who had been brought from farms twenty or thirty kilometers away, saw this as a miracle.</t1613> <t1614>When they heard the sound of the rifle, when they saw the green flag waving on the pole, their chests swelled with pride; the conversation inevitably turned to the old heroic days, the expulsion of Jones from the farm, the drafting of the Seven Commandments, and the defeat of the humans who tried to take over the farm.</t1614> <t1615>They had not given up on any of the old dreams.</t1615> <t1616>They had not lost their belief in the Animal Republic foretold by Old Major, where not a single human foot would tread on the green fields of England.</t1616> <t1617>One day it would definitely come true; maybe it wouldn't happen immediately, maybe those who were alive now wouldn't see those days, but their dreams would definitely come true one day.</t1617> <t1618>Even the tune of the song "Beasts of England" was being hummed secretly here and there; although none of them dared to sing it out loud, it was certain that every animal on the farm knew the song by heart.</t1618> <t1619>They might have been living a hard life, their hopes might not have all come true, but they were aware that they were different from other animals.</t1619> <t1620>If they were hungry, it wasn't because they were feeding tyrannical humans; if they were working hard, at least they were working for themselves.</t1620> <t1621>No animal walked on two legs.</t1621> <t1622>No animal was the "master" of any other animal.</t1622> <t1623>All animals were equal.</t1623>
<t1624>It was the beginning of summer.</t1624> <t1625>One day, Squealer ordered the sheep to follow him and took them to a place at the other end of the farm, covered with young birch trees.</t1625> <t1626>Under Squealer's supervision, the sheep ate the leaves of the trees until evening.</t1626> <t1627>Before returning to the farmhouse in the evening, Squealer instructed the sheep to stay there; after all, the weather was warm.</t1627> <t1628>The sheep stayed there for an entire week; during this time, the other animals did not encounter the sheep at all.</t1628> <t1629>Squealer went there every day, spending most of the day with the sheep.</t1629> <t1630>He told them that he was teaching them a new song and that they needed to be away from prying eyes to work comfortably.</t1630>
<t1631>On a beautiful evening when the sheep had just returned to the farm, the animals had finished their work and were heading towards the farm buildings.</t1631> <t1632>Suddenly, a terrifying neigh was heard from the yard.</t1632> <t1633>The animals froze in their tracks, startled.</t1633> <t1634>It was Clover's voice.</t1634> <t1635>When she neighed once more, all the animals galloped into the yard.</t1635> <t1636>And they saw what Clover had seen:</t1636>
<t1637>A pig walking on its hind legs.</t1637>
<t1638>This was Squealer.</t1638> <t1639>He was struggling to move forward as he was not used to carrying his large body on his hind legs, but he could still walk around the yard without losing his balance.</t1639> <t1640>Soon, a bunch of pigs came out of the farmhouse door; they were all walking on their hind legs.</t1640> <t1641>Some were more skillful, while others had difficulty maintaining their balance; but they were all wandering around the yard without falling.</t1641> <t1642>Finally, the dogs barked with terrifying sounds, the black rooster crowed loudly, and Napoleon appeared at the door: He was walking upright with all his grandeur, casting haughty glances to his right and left; his dogs were jumping around him.</t1642>
<t1643>There was a whip on one of its front legs!</t1643>
<t1644>A deathly silence had enveloped the surroundings.</t1644> <t1645>The animals, huddled together in bewilderment and fear, watched the pigs walking slowly around the yard.</t1645> <t1646>It was as if the world had turned upside down.</t1646> <t1647>As soon as their initial shock passed, despite their fear of the dogs and their long-standing habit of never complaining or criticizing anything, they were about to raise their voices against the pigs when the sheep, as if on cue, began to bleat in unison:</t1647>
<t1648>"Four legs good, two legs better!</t1648> <t1649>Four legs good, two legs better!</t1649> <t1650>Four legs good, two legs better!</t1650><t1651>"</t1651>
<t1652>The bleating lasted for five minutes without interruption.</t1652> <t1653>By the time the sheep fell silent, the pigs had already returned to the farmhouse; the opportunity to protest had been missed.</t1653>
<t1654>Benjamin turned around when he noticed someone touching his shoulder with their nose.</t1654> <t1655>It was Clover.</t1655> <t1656>Her old eyes were duller than ever.</t1656> <t1657>Without saying anything, she gently pulled Benjamin by his mane and led him to the wall of the big barn where the Seven Commandments were written.</t1657> <t1658>They stood there for a while, looking at the white letters on the tar-covered wall.</t1658>
<t1659>In the end, Clover said, "My eyes aren't seeing well anymore."</t1659> <t1660>"Though, I couldn't read properly even when I was young.</t1660> <t1661>But it seems to me that there is a change in the writings.</t1661> <t1662>Do the Seven Commandments still stand as they used to, Benjamin?</t1662><t1663>"</t1663>
<t1664>Benjamin broke his principle for the first time and read the writing on the wall to Clover.</t1664> <t1665>There was only one commandment written on the wall:</t1665>
<t1666>ALL ANIMALS ARE EQUAL</t1666>
<t1667>BUT SOME ANIMALS</t1667>
<t1668>MORE EQUAL THAN OTHERS</t1668>
<t1669>The next day, it did not seem strange to anyone that all the pigs overseeing the farm work had whips.</t1669> <t1670>No one was surprised when it was heard that the pigs had gotten themselves a radio, were preparing to get a telephone line, and had subscribed to the John Bull and Tit-Bits magazines and the Daily Mirror newspaper.</t1670> <t1671>It did not seem odd to anyone that Napoleon was walking around the garden of the farmhouse with a pipe in his mouth.</t1671> <t1672>Even the fact that the pigs took Mrs. Jones's clothes from the wardrobe and wore them, that Napoleon walked around in a black coat, breeches, and leather leggings, and that his favorite sow wore the shimmering silk dress that Mrs. Jones once wore on Sundays did not surprise anyone.</t1672>
<t1673>About a week later, one afternoon, small horse-drawn carriages arrived at the farm.</t1673> <t1674>A delegation from neighboring farms had been called for an inspection tour.</t1674> <t1675>The farmers who toured the entire farm expressed their admiration for everything they saw, especially the windmill.</t1675> <t1676>The animals were weeding the turnip field.</t1676> <t1677>They were completely absorbed in their work; they didn't even lift their heads as they couldn't decide whether to be more afraid of the pigs or the human guests visiting the farm.</t1677>
<t1678>In the evening, laughter and songs rose from the farmhouse.</t1678> <t1679>The animals, hearing the mingling sounds, suddenly pricked up their ears.</t1679> <t1680>What were the animals and humans, meeting under equal conditions for the first time, doing there?</t1680> <t1681>All together, trying to make no noise, they approached the farmhouse garden.</t1681>
<t1682>When they arrived in front of the garden gate, they hesitated in fear, but with Clover leading the way, they tiptoed inside and headed towards the house.</t1682> <t1683>The animals tall enough peeked inside through the dining room window.</t1683> <t1684>Around the long table, six farmers and six leading pigs were seated.</t1684> <t1685>Napoleon had taken the head of the table, seated in the place of honor.</t1685> <t1686>The pigs did not appear uncomfortable in their chairs at all.</t1686> <t1687>They had paused their card game and were raising their glasses in a toast.</t1687> <t1688>A large pitcher was being passed around, filling glasses with beer.</t1688> <t1689>None of them had noticed the astonished faces of the animals peeking in through the window.</t1689>
<t1690>Mr. Pilkington, the owner of Foxwood Farm, stood up with his glass in hand.</t1690> <t1691>He said that he would soon invite everyone to raise their glasses in a toast, but first, he felt it was his duty to say a few words.</t1691>
<t1692>The fact that a long period of distrust and disagreement had finally come to an end was a great source of happiness for him and undoubtedly for everyone present there.</t1692><t1693>People from neighboring farms had approached the respectable owners of Animal Farm with suspicion, if not hostility, for a while; but he and those present had not even shared this suspicious approach of the people.</t1693><t1694>Unfortunate events had occurred, and some had fallen into wrong thoughts.</t1694><t1695>It was thought that a farm owned and managed by pigs was not at all ordinary, and it was feared that it might cause unease in the surrounding farms.</t1695><t1696>Many farmers, without conducting the slightest investigation, had assumed that such a farm would be rife with lawlessness and disorder.</t1696><t1697>They had been uneasy, thinking that what was happening at Animal Farm could affect not only their own animals but also the people working on their farms.</t1697><t1698>But all such doubts had now dissipated.</t1698><t1699>Today, he and his friends had come there, toured around Animal Farm, and encountered not only the latest methods but also a discipline and order that should set an example for all farmers.</t1699><t1700>It would probably not be wrong to say that the lower animals at Animal Farm worked more and ate less than all the animals in the country.</t1700><t1701>Today, indeed, he and his friends had seen such things at Animal Farm that they were thinking of immediately implementing them on their own farms.</t1701>
<t1702>He wanted to end his words by once again emphasizing the feelings of friendship that existed and should continue between Animal Farm and its neighbors.</t1702> <t1703>There was not the slightest conflict of interest between the pigs and the humans, and he saw no reason for there to be.</t1703> <t1704>Their efforts and the difficulties they encountered were the same.</t1704> <t1705>Wasn't the labor problem the same everywhere?</t1705> <t1706>Mr. Pilkington was about to make a clever joke that seemed to have been prepared in advance, but he had to stop his speech when he couldn't contain his laughter.</t1706> <t1707>After laughing until his chubby cheeks turned purple, he delivered the joke: "If you have to deal with your lower-class animals," he said, "we have to deal with our lower-class humans!" The joke drowned the table in laughter.</t1707> <t1708>Mr. Pilkington couldn't help but congratulate the pigs once again for keeping rations low at Animal Farm, ensuring work hours were longer than anywhere else, and not spoiling the animals by overwhelming them with abundance.</t1708>
<t1709>Finally, Mr. Pilkington, who invited everyone to stand up and fill their glasses, said, "Come on, gentlemen!"</t1709> <t1710>"Cheers! To the honor of Animal Farm!</t1710><t1711>"</t1711>
<t1712>Everyone was shouting and stamping their feet with excitement.</t1712> <t1713>Napoleon was so delighted that he got up from his seat, walked around the table, clinked glasses with Mr. Pilkington, and then downed his beer in one gulp.</t1713> <t1714>When the shouting subsided, Napoleon, who was still standing, indicated that he had a few words to say.</t1714>
<t1715>As always, he spoke briefly and concisely.</t1715> <t1716>He was also very happy because the period of disagreement had ended.</t1716> <t1717>For a long time, there had been rumors that his and his friends' attitudes and behaviors were destructive, moreover revolutionary.</t1717> <t1718>These rumors must have been spread by one of his ill-hearted enemies.</t1718> <t1719>It was said that they incited the animals on neighboring farms to revolt.</t1719> <t1720>Such a lie had never been seen before, indeed!</t1720> <t1721>However, their only desire had always been to live in peace with their neighbors and to maintain business relations properly.</t1721> <t1722>The farm he was proud to manage was a cooperative venture.</t1722> <t1723>The co-owners of the title deeds in his hand were the pigs.</t1723>
<t1724>Although he never believed that the old suspicions still persisted, he nevertheless saw the benefit in noting that some changes had recently been made to further increase the trust placed in the farm's operations.</t1724> <t1725>Until today, among the animals on the farm, there was a silly habit of calling each other "Comrade."</t1725> <t1726>This habit would be put to an end.</t1726> <t1727>Another strange habit, the origin of which they did not know, was their ceremonial march past the pig's head mounted on a stump in the garden every Sunday morning.</t1727> <t1728>This habit would also be put to an end.</t1728> <t1729>They had already buried the pig's head in the ground.</t1729> <t1730>If the guests had looked carefully at the green flag waving on the pole, they must have noticed that the white hoof and horn had been removed from the flag.</t1730> <t1731>From now on, the flag would be plain green.</t1731>
<t1732>However, he wanted to make a small correction to Mr. Pilkington's extraordinary speech filled with feelings of friendship.</t1732> <t1733>Throughout his speech, Mr. Pilkington had referred to their farm as "Animal Farm."</t1733> <t1734>There was no doubt that it was impossible for him to know that the name "Animal Farm" had been abolished, because he was announcing it there for the first time now.</t1734> <t1735>From now on, the farm would once again be known by its original name, "Manor Farm."</t1735>
<t1736>Napoleon, while finishing his words, said, "Gentlemen."</t1736> <t1737>"We will raise our glasses once more, but this time not in honor of Animal Farm!</t1737> <t1738>Fill your glasses to the brim.</t1738> <t1739>Come on, gentlemen: To the honor of Manor Farm!</t1739><t1740>"</t1740>
<t1741>With a heartfelt enthusiasm, they shouted, "Cheers!"; the beers were finished in one gulp.</t1741> <t1742>However, while the animals outside were watching this scene, they sensed something strange.</t1742> <t1743>There was something different about the faces of the pigs, but what was it?</t1743> <t1744>Clover's old dull eyes were wandering over the faces one by one.</t1744> <t1745>The jaws of some of the pigs had become fivefold, some fourfold, and some threefold.</t1745> <t1746>But what was the thing that was melting and changing?</t1746> <t1747>A little later, the shouting ceased, those at the table picked up their papers and resumed their interrupted game; the animals quietly moved away from there.</t1747>
<t1748>They had only moved about twenty or thirty meters away when they stopped in their tracks.</t1748> <t1749>A commotion had erupted in the farmhouse.</t1749> <t1750>They turned back and ran quickly to the house, peeking inside through the window.</t1750> <t1751>A terrible fight had broken out in the house: shouting, banging on the table, suspicious stern looks, cursing and chaos...</t1751> <t1752>Apparently, the cause of the fight was that both Napoleon and Mr. Pilkington had drawn the ace of spades.</t1752>
<t1753>Inside, all twelve were shouting angrily, and all twelve looked alike.</t1753> <t1754>It was now clear what had happened to the faces of the pigs.</t1754> <t1755>The animals outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, but it was impossible to say which was which.</t1755>
<t1756>November 1943 - February 1944</t1756>
