<t0>Prologue</t0>
<t1>I suppose that each person gets their own miracle.</t1> <t2>For example, I will probably never be struck by lightning, nor win a Nobel Prize, nor become the dictator of a small Pacific island country, nor contract terminal ear cancer, nor spontaneously combust.</t2> <t3>But considering all the improbabilities together, surely one of them will happen to each of us.</t3> <t4>I could have seen it rain frogs.</t4> <t5>I could have stepped on Mars.</t5> <t6>I could have been swallowed by a whale.</t6> <t7>I could have married the Queen of England or survived for months in the middle of the sea.</t7> <t8>But my miracle was different.</t8> <t9>My miracle was this: out of all the houses in all the subdivisions in all of Florida, I ended up living next door to Margo Roth Spiegelman.</t9>
<t10>Our subdivision, Jefferson Park, had been a naval base.</t10> <t11>But there came a time when the navy no longer needed it, so they returned the land to the citizens of Orlando, Florida, who decided to build a huge subdivision, because that's what you do with land in Florida.</t11> <t12>My parents and Margo's parents started living door to door as soon as the first houses were built.</t12> <t13>Margo and I were two years old.</t13>
<t14>Before Jefferson Park was Pleasantville, and before it was a naval base, it was owned by a guy named Jefferson, a certain Doctor Jefferson Jefferson.</t14> <t15>In Orlando, there is a school named after Doctor Jefferson Jefferson and also a large charitable foundation, although the fascinating and incredible, but true, thing about Doctor Jefferson Jefferson is that he wasn't a doctor of anything.</t15> <t16>He was a simple orange juice salesman named Jefferson Jefferson.</t16> <t17>Upon becoming rich and powerful, he went to the courthouse, made "Jefferson" his middle name, and changed his first name to "Dr," with a capital D.</t17>
<t18>When Margo and I were nine years old, our parents were friends, so every now and then we played together, took our bikes, left the cul-de-sacs behind, and went to the park in the center of the development.</t18>
<t19>I got nervous every time they told me that Margo was going to stop by my house, because she was the most extraordinarily beautiful creature that God had ever created.</t19> <t20>On the morning in question, she was wearing white shorts and a pink t-shirt with a green dragon that was breathing bright orange fire.</t20> <t21>I find it difficult to explain how cool the t-shirt seemed to me at that moment.</t21>
<t22>Margo, as always, pedaled standing up, with her body leaning over the handlebars and her purple sports shoes forming a circular blur.</t22> <t23>It was a hot and humid day in March.</t23> <t24>The sky was clear, but the air had an acidic taste, as if a storm was approaching.</t24>
<t25>At that time, I fancied myself an inventor, so after we had tied up the bikes, while we walked the short path that would take us to the playground, I told Margo that I had come up with an invention called the Ringolator.</t25> <t26>The Ringolator would be a giant cannon that would shoot enormous colored rocks into a very low orbit, which would give Earth rings very similar to Saturn's.</t26> <t27>(I still think it would be a good idea, but it turns out that building a cannon that shoots rocks into a low orbit is quite complicated).</t27>
<t28>I had been in that park so many times that I knew it inch by inch, so we had barely entered when I started to feel that something was wrong, although at first, I didn't see what had changed.</t28>
<t29>—Quentin —Margo said to me in a low and calm voice.</t29>
<t30>He was pointing.</t30> <t31>And then I realized what had changed.</t31>
<t32>A few steps from us there was an oak tree.</t32> <t33>Thick, twisted, and looking very old.</t33> <t34>It was not new.</t34> <t35>The playground, to our right.</t35> <t36>It was not new either.</t36> <t37>But suddenly I saw a guy in a gray suit collapsed at the foot of the oak tree's trunk.</t37> <t38>He wasn't moving.</t38> <t39>That was new.</t39> <t40>He was surrounded by blood.</t40> <t41>A half-dried thread was coming out of his mouth.</t41> <t42>His mouth was open in a gesture that seemed impossible.</t42> <t43>Flies were landing on his pale forehead.</t43>
<t44>—He's dead —said Margo, as if I hadn't noticed.</t44>
<t45>I took two small steps back.</t45> <t46>I remember thinking that if I made a sudden move, it would get up and attack me.</t46> <t47>Maybe it was a zombie.</t47> <t48>I knew that zombies didn't exist, but it certainly looked like a potential zombie.</t48>
<t49>As he took those two steps back, Margo took two more, also small and silent, forward.</t49>
<t50>—He has his eyes open —he told me.</t50>
<t51>—Let's go home —I replied.</t51>
<t52>—I thought that when you die, you close your eyes —he said.</t52>
<t53>—Let's go home to notify.</t53>
<t54>He took another step.</t54> <t55>He was already close enough to stretch out his arm and touch her foot.</t55>
<t56>—What do you think happened to him? —he asked me—.</t56> <t57>Maybe it's a drug-related issue or something like that.</t57>
<t58>I didn't want to leave Margo alone with the dead man, who might have turned into an aggressive zombie, but I also didn't dare to stay there discussing the circumstances of his death.</t58> <t59>I gathered all my courage, took a step forward, and held her hand.</t59>
<t60>—Let's leave right now, Margo!</t60>
<t61>—Okay, yes —he replied to me.</t61>
<t62>We ran towards the bikes.</t62> <t63>My stomach was churning with something that felt a lot like excitement, but wasn't.</t63> <t64>We got on the bikes and I let her go ahead, because I was crying and didn't want her to see me.</t64> <t65>I saw blood on the soles of her purple sneakers.</t65> <t66>His blood.</t66> <t67>The dead guy's blood.</t67>
<t68>We each arrived at our respective homes.</t68> <t69>My parents called emergency services, I heard the sirens in the distance and asked for permission to go out and see the fire trucks, but since my mother said no, I went to take a nap.</t69>
<t70>Both my father and my mother are psychologists, which means I am freaking balanced.</t70> <t71>When I woke up, I had a long conversation with my mother about the cycle of life, about how death is a part of life, but a part I didn't need to worry too much about at nine years old, and I felt better.</t71> <t72>The truth is that it never worried me too much, which is saying a lot, because I usually worry about everything.</t72>
<t73>The issue is the following: I found a dead guy.</t73> <t74>The small and adorable nine-year-old boy and his even smaller and more adorable playmate found a guy with blood coming out of his mouth, and that blood was on their small and adorable sneakers as we rode our bikes home.</t74> <t75>It's very dramatic and all that, but so what?</t75> <t76>I didn't know the guy.</t76> <t77>Every damn day, people I don't know die.</t77> <t78>If I had to have a nervous breakdown every time something awful happened in the world, I'd end up crazier than a goat.</t78>
<t79>That night I went into my room at nine o'clock sharp to get into bed, because nine was the time I had to go to sleep.</t79> <t80>My mother tucked me in and told me she loved me.</t80> <t81>I said to her, "See you tomorrow," and she replied, "See you tomorrow," and then she turned off the light and closed the door almost all the way.</t81>
<t82>I was turning to my side when I saw Margo Roth Spiegelman on the other side of my window, her face almost pressed against the screen.</t82> <t83>I got up and opened the window, but the screen that separated us continued to pixelate her.</t83>
<t84>—I have investigated —she told me very seriously.</t84>
<t85>Although the mosquito net divided her face even up close, I saw that she was holding a small notebook and a pencil with teeth marks around the eraser.</t85> <t86>She glanced at her notes.</t86>
<t87>—Mrs. Feldman, from Jefferson Court, told me his name was Robert Joyner.</t87> <t88>She told me he lived on Jefferson Road, in one of the apartments above the supermarket, so I went over there and there were a bunch of police officers.</t88> <t89>One of them asked me if I worked for the school newspaper, and I replied that our school didn't have a newspaper, so he said that since I wasn't a journalist, he would answer my questions.</t89> <t90>He told me that Robert Joyner was thirty-six years old.</t90> <t91>He was a lawyer.</t91> <t92>They wouldn't let me into the house, but a woman named Juanita Alvarez lives next door, so I went into her house asking if she could lend me a cup of sugar.</t92> <t93>She told me that Robert Joyner had committed suicide with a gun.</t93> <t94>Then I asked her why, and she replied that he was sad because he was getting a divorce.</t94>
<t95>Margo fell silent and I just looked at her, observing her gray face in the moonlight, which the mosquito net divided into a thousand little squares.</t95> <t96>Her eyes, wide open, moved back and forth from her notebook to me.</t96>
<t97>—Many people get divorced and don't commit suicide —I told him.</t97>
<t98>—I already know —she answered me nervously—.</t98> <t99>That's what I told Juanita Álvarez.</t99> <t100>And then she told me… —Margo turned the page of the notebook—.</t100> <t101>She told me that Mr. Joyner had problems.</t101> <t102>And then I asked her what she meant, and she answered me that the only thing we could do for him was to pray and that I should go take the sugar to my mother.</t102> <t103>I told her to forget the sugar and I left.</t103>
<t104>Again, I didn't say anything.</t104> <t105>I just wanted Margo to keep talking with that little nervous voice, almost knowing something, which made me feel like something important was happening to me.</t105>
<t106>—I think I might know why —he finally said.</t106>
<t107>—Why?</t107>
<t108>—Maybe the strings inside him broke —he answered me.</t108>
<t109>While I was trying to think of something to say to her, I leaned forward, pressed the zipper of the mosquito net, and pulled it away from the window.</t109> <t110>I left it on the floor, but Margo didn't give me the chance to speak.</t110> <t111>Before I had sat back down, she lifted her face towards me and whispered:</t111>
<t112>—Close the window.</t112>
<t113>So I closed it.</t113> <t114>I thought she would leave, but she stayed there looking at me.</t114> <t115>I waved goodbye and smiled at her, but her eyes seemed to be staring at something behind me, something monstrous that had made her very pale, and I was too scared to turn around and see what it was.</t115> <t116>But there was nothing behind me, of course… except maybe the dead guy.</t116>
<t117>I left my hand still.</t117> <t118>We stared at each other, each from our side of the glass.</t118> <t119>Our heads were at the same height.</t119> <t120>I don't remember how the story ended, whether I went to bed or she did.</t120> <t121>In my memory, it doesn't end.</t121> <t122>We are still there, looking at each other, forever.</t122>
<t123>Margo always liked mysteries.</t123> <t124>And considering everything that happened afterward, I will never stop thinking that maybe she liked mysteries so much that she became one.</t124>
<t125>FIRST PART</t125>
<t126>The threads</t126>
<t127>1</t127>
<t128>The longest day of my life started with a delay.</t128> <t129>I woke up late, spent too much time in the shower, and in the end, I had to enjoy breakfast in the passenger seat of my mother's minivan at 7:17 in the morning on a Wednesday.</t129>
<t130>I used to go to school in my best friend Ben Starling's car, but Ben had left on time, so I couldn't rely on him.</t130> <t131>For us, "on time" meant half an hour before classes started, because those thirty minutes before the first bell rang were the highlight of our social agenda.</t131> <t132>We would stand in front of the side door that led to the high school band rehearsal room and chat.</t132> <t133>Since most of my friends played in the band, I spent almost all my free hours at school less than five meters from the rehearsal room.</t133> <t134>But I didn't play, because I have less of an ear for music than a deaf person.</t134> <t135>That day I was going to be twenty minutes late, which technically meant that I would still arrive ten minutes before classes started.</t135>
<t136>While driving, my mother asked me about classes, exams, and the prom.</t136>
<t137>—I don't believe in prom dances —I reminded him as I turned a corner.</t137>
<t138>I skillfully tilted my cereal to adjust it to the force of gravity.</t138> <t139>It wasn't the first time I had done it.</t139>
<t140>—Well, there's nothing wrong with going with a friend.</t140> <t141>I'm sure you could ask Cassie Hiney.</t141>
<t142>Yes, he could have asked Cassie Hiney, who was very nice, friendly, and pretty, despite her tremendously unfortunate last name, which in English means "butt".</t142>
<t143>—It's not that I don't like prom dances.</t143> <t144>It's that I also don't like the people who like prom dances —I explained to my mother.</t144>
<t145>Although in reality it was not true.</t145> <t146>Ben had insisted on going.</t146>
<t147>My mother turned towards the school, and I held the almost empty bowl with both hands as we went over a speed bump.</t147> <t148>I glanced at the senior student parking lot.</t148> <t149>Margo Roth Spiegelman's silver Honda was parked in its usual spot.</t149> <t150>My mother pulled the car into an alley in front of the rehearsal room and gave me a kiss on the cheek.</t150> <t151>As I got out, I saw Ben and my other friends, gathered in a semicircle.</t151>
<t152>I approached them, and the semicircle soon opened up to include me.</t152> <t153>They were talking about my ex-girlfriend, Suzie Chung, who played the cello and had apparently caused quite a stir because she was dating a baseball player named Taddy Mac.</t153> <t154>I didn't know if that was his real name.</t154> <t155>In any case, Suzie had decided to go to the prom with Taddy Mac.</t155> <t156>Another victim.</t156>
<t157>—Colleague —Ben said to me, who was in front of me.</t157>
<t158>He moved his head, turned halfway around, walked away from the circle, and went in.</t158> <t159>I followed him.</t159> <t160>Ben, a short boy with olive skin who barely seemed to have reached puberty, had been my best friend since fifth grade, when we both finally admitted the evidence that neither of us was likely to find a better friend.</t160> <t161>Besides, he put a lot of effort into it, and I liked that... most of the time.</t161>
<t162>—How are you? —I asked him.</t162>
<t163>We were inside, in a safe place.</t163> <t164>The other conversations prevented ours from being heard.</t164>
<t165>—Radar is going to the prom —he told me grumpily.</t165>
<t166>Radar was our other best friend.</t166> <t167>We called him Radar because he looked like a short guy with glasses from the old TV series M*A*S*H who was called that, except that: 1) The TV Radar wasn't black, and 2)</t167> <t168>At some point after we gave him the nickname, our Radar grew about fifteen centimeters and got contact lenses, so I guess that, 3)</t168> <t169>In reality, he didn't look anything like the guy from M*A*S*H, but, 4)</t169> <t170>Since there were only three and a half weeks left until the end of the school year, we weren't too worried about the task of finding him another nickname.</t170>
<t171>—Angela? —I asked her.</t171>
<t172>Radar never told us anything about his love life, which did not deter us from speculating every now and then.</t172>
<t173>Ben nodded.</t173>
<t174>—Do you remember that I had thought about inviting a freshman to the dance, because they are the only ones who don't know the story of Bloody Ben?</t174>
<t175>I nodded.</t175>
<t176>—Well —Ben continued—, this morning a very cute freshman came up to me and asked if I was Bloody Ben.</t176> <t177>I started to explain to her that it was a kidney infection, but she laughed and walked away.</t177> <t178>So that's it.</t178>
<t179>Two years ago, they had to admit Ben to the hospital for a kidney infection, but Becca Arrington, Margo's best friend, spread the rumor that the real reason he was urinating blood was because he spent the day masturbating.</t179> <t180>Even though it was clinically implausible, Ben had been burdened with that story ever since.</t180>
<t181>—What a piece of crap —I told him.</t181>
<t182>Ben started telling me his plans to find a girl, but I was only half-listening, because amidst the increasingly dense crowd of people filling the lobby, I saw Margo Roth Spiegelman.</t182> <t183>She was next to her locker, beside her boyfriend, Jase.</t183> <t184>She was wearing a white knee-length skirt and a blue patterned top.</t184> <t185>I could see her collarbone.</t185> <t186>She was laughing hysterically.</t186> <t187>Her shoulders were hunched forward, the corners of her large eyes wrinkled, and her mouth open.</t187> <t188>But she didn't seem to be laughing at something Jase had said, as she was looking elsewhere, towards the lockers on the other side of the lobby.</t188> <t189>I followed her gaze and saw Becca Arrington on top of a baseball player, as if the guy were a Christmas tree and she an ornament.</t189> <t190>I smiled at Margo, even though I knew she couldn't see me.</t190>
<t191>—You should go for it, buddy.</t191> <t192>Forget about Jase.</t192> <t193>God, that chick is smoking hot.</t193>
<t194>As we moved forward, I kept glancing at her through the crowd, quick snapshots, a photographic series titled Perfection Stays Still While Mortals Pass By.</t194> <t195>As I got closer, I thought that maybe she wasn't laughing.</t195> <t196>Maybe she had been surprised, given a gift or something like that.</t196> <t197>It seemed like she couldn't close her mouth.</t197>
<t198>—Yes —I said to Ben.</t198>
<t199>I kept not paying attention to him, I kept trying not to lose sight of Margo without making it too obvious.</t199> <t200>It's not that she was a beauty.</t200> <t201>She was simply stunning, in the literal sense.</t201> <t202>And then we left her behind, too many people were passing between her and me, and at no point had I gotten close enough to hear what she was saying or understand what the hilarious surprise had been.</t202> <t203>Ben shook his head.</t203> <t204>He had seen me looking at her a thousand times and was used to it.</t204>
<t205>—The truth is that she's good-looking, but not that much.</t205> <t206>Do you know who is really good-looking?</t206>
<t207>—Who? —I asked him.</t207>
<t208>—Lacey —she replied, who was Margo's other best friend—.</t208> <t209>And your mother, dude.</t209> <t210>This morning I saw your mother giving you a kiss and, forgive me, but I swear to God I thought: "Damn, I wish I were Q. And I wish I had dicks on my cheeks."</t210>
<t211>I elbowed him in the ribs, although I kept thinking about Margo, because she was the only myth living next door to my house.</t211> <t212>Margo Roth Spiegelman, whose six-syllable name we used to say in full with a kind of silent reverence.</t212> <t213>Margo Roth Spiegelman, whose epic adventures circulated around the school like a summer storm.</t213> <t214>An old man who lived in a ramshackle house in Hot Coffee, Mississippi, had taught Margo to play the guitar.</t214> <t215>Margo Roth Spiegelman, who had traveled for three days with a circus, where they thought she had potential for the trapeze.</t215> <t216>Margo Roth Spiegelman, who had sipped herbal tea backstage with the Mallionaires after a concert in Saint Louis, while they drank whiskey.</t216> <t217>Margo Roth Spiegelman, who had sneaked into that concert by telling the security guard that she was the bassist's girlfriend, didn't they recognize her?, come on, guys, seriously, I'm Margo Roth Spiegelman, and if you're going to ask the bassist to come see who I am, he'll either say I'm his girlfriend or that he wishes I were, and then the security guard went to ask him, and the bassist said: "Yes, she's my girlfriend, let her in," and then the bassist wanted to make out with her, but she rejected the bassist of the Mallionaires!</t217>
<t218>When we talked about his stories, we always ended up saying, "Wow, can you imagine that?".</t218> <t219>In general, we couldn't imagine them, but they always turned out to be true.</t219>
<t220>And we arrived at our lockers.</t220> <t221>Radar was leaning against Ben's, typing on his handheld computer.</t221>
<t222>—So you're going to the dance —I said to her.</t222>
<t223>He lifted his gaze and then lowered it again.</t223>
<t224>—I am fixing the Omnictionary article about a former French prime minister.</t224> <t225>Last night someone deleted the entire entry and wrote "Jacques Chirac is a gay," which turns out to be incorrect both semantically and grammatically.</t225>
<t226>Radar is an active editor of the Omnictionary, an online encyclopedia created by users.</t226> <t227>He dedicates his entire life to maintaining and caring for the Omnictionary.</t227> <t228>And that was one of the various reasons why it surprised us that he had invited a girl to the prom.</t228>
<t229>—So you're going to the dance —I repeated.</t229>
<t230>—Sorry —he replied without raising his gaze.</t230>
<t231>Everyone knew that I refused to go to the dance.</t231> <t232>It didn't interest me in the slightest: neither slow dances, nor fast dances, nor the suits, and even less the rented tuxedo.</t232> <t233>Renting a tuxedo seemed to me an excellent way to catch any dreadful disease from the previous renter, and it was not my intention to become the only virgin in the world with crabs.</t233>
<t234>—Colleague —Ben said to Radar—, the freshmen have found out about the story of Bloody Ben.</t234> <t235>—Radar finally put away his computer and nodded with a sympathetic expression—.</t235> <t236>So the only two strategies I have left are to find a date for the dance online or fly to Missouri and kidnap some corn-fed chick.</t236>
<t237>I had tried to explain to Ben that "pava" sounded much more sexist and pathetic than "retro-cool," but he refused to stop saying it.</t237> <t238>He called his own mother "pava."</t238> <t239>He was hopeless.</t239>
<t240>—I'll ask Angela if she knows anyone —said Radar—.</t240> <t241>Although getting you a date for the dance will be harder than turning lead into gold.</t241>
<t242>—Getting a date for the dance is so tough that just thinking about it could cut diamonds —I added.</t242>
<t243>Radar gave a couple of punches to a locker to show he agreed and then released another phrase:</t243>
<t244>—Ben, getting you a date for the dance is so tough that the United States government believes the problem cannot be resolved through diplomatic means, but will require the use of force.</t244>
<t245>I was thinking about another occurrence when the three of us simultaneously saw the human-shaped bottle of anabolic steroids known as Chuck Parson approaching us with some purpose.</t245> <t246>Chuck Parson didn't participate in team sports because that would distract him from his main goal in life: to one day be convicted of homicide.</t246>
<t247>—Hello, faggots —he said.</t247>
<t248>—Chuck —I responded as amicably as I could.</t248>
<t249>Chuck hadn't caused us any serious problems in the last two years, because someone from the cool kids' side had given the order to leave us alone, so Chuck didn't even speak to us.</t249>
<t250>Maybe because I was the one who had answered him, or maybe not, he placed both hands on the locker, with me in the middle, and came close enough for me to consider what brand of toothpaste he used.</t250>
<t251>—What do you know about Margo and Jase?</t251>
<t252>—Ugh —I replied.</t252>
<t253>I thought about everything I knew about them: Jase was Margo Roth Spiegelman's first and only serious boyfriend.</t253> <t254>They had started dating at the end of the previous year.</t254> <t255>Both were going to attend the University of Florida the following year.</t255> <t256>Jase had received a scholarship to play on the baseball team.</t256> <t257>He had never been inside Margo's house, he only picked her up.</t257> <t258>Margo didn't seem to like him that much, but the truth was she never seemed to like anyone that much.</t258>
<t259>—Nothing —I finally replied to him.</t259>
<t260>—Don't mess with me —he growled.</t260>
<t261>—I barely know her —I told him, and it could be said that in recent times it was true.</t261>
<t262>He considered my answer for a minute, and I tried with all my might not to avert my gaze from his crossed eyes.</t262> <t263>He very gently nodded his head, stepped away from the locker, and went to his first class of the morning: Pectoral Muscle Maintenance.</t263> <t264>The second bell rang.</t264> <t265>There was one minute left before classes started.</t265> <t266>Radar and I had calculus, and Ben had finite mathematics.</t266> <t267>Our classes were next to each other.</t267> <t268>We headed to them together, the three of us in a row, trusting that the human tide would part enough to let us through, and it did.</t268>
<t269>—Getting you a date for the dance is so hard that a thousand monkeys typing on a thousand typewriters for a thousand years wouldn't write "I'll go to the prom with Ben" even once —I said.</t269>
<t270>Ben couldn't resist beating himself up:</t270>
<t271>—I have so few chances that even Q's grandmother has rejected me.</t271> <t272>She told me she was waiting for Radar to ask her.</t272>
<t273>Radar nodded slowly.</t273>
<t274>—It's true, Q. Your grandmother loves your friends.</t274>
<t275>It was pathetically easy to forget about Chuck and talk about the prom, even though I didn't give a damn.</t275> <t276>That's how life was that morning: nothing mattered too much, neither the good things nor the bad.</t276> <t277>We were dedicated to having fun, and we were doing reasonably well.</t277>
<t278>I spent the next three hours in class, trying not to look at the clocks above the various blackboards, and then looking at them and being surprised that only a few minutes had passed since the last time I had looked.</t278> <t279>Even though I had almost four years of experience looking at those clocks, their slowness never ceased to amaze me.</t279> <t280>If I am ever told that I have one day left to live, I will go straight to the sacred halls of Winter Park High School, where it is known that a day lasts a thousand years.</t280>
<t281>But, no matter how much it seemed that third-hour physics would never end, it did end, and suddenly I was in the cafeteria with Ben.</t281> <t282>Radar ate later with the other friends, so Ben and I usually sat alone, with a couple of seats between us and a group of theater guys.</t282> <t283>That day we were both eating pepperoni mini pizzas.</t283>
<t284>—The pizza is good —I said.</t284>
<t285>Ben nodded distractedly.</t285>
<t286>—What's happening? —I asked him.</t286>
<t287>—Nazza —he said with his mouth full of pizza.</t287> <t288>He swallowed—.</t288> <t289>I know you think it's nonsense, but I want to go to the dance.</t289>
<t290>—One: yes, I think it's nonsense; two: if you feel like going, go, and three: if I'm not mistaken, you haven't even asked anyone.</t290>
<t291>—I asked Cassie Hiney in math class.</t291> <t292>I wrote her a note.</t292>
<t293>I raised my eyebrows in a questioning gesture.</t293> <t294>Ben put a hand into a pocket of his shorts and slipped me a very folded piece of paper.</t294> <t295>I flattened it:</t295>
<t296>Ben:</t296> Hello, how are you?
<t297>I would love to go to the dance with you, but I have already made plans with Frank.</t297> <t298>I'm sorry.</t298>
<t299>C.</t299>
<t300>I folded it again and slid it back across the table.</t300> <t301>I remembered playing paper football on those tables.</t301>
<t302>—What a piece of crap —I told him.</t302>
<t303>—Yes, you see.</t303>
<t304>The ambient sound seemed to close in on us.</t304> <t305>We remained silent for a moment, and then Ben looked at me very seriously and said:</t305>
<t306>—I'm going to be a big hit at the faculty.</t306> <t307>I'll make it into the Guinness Book of World Records, in the category "Has left the most chicks satisfied."</t307>
<t308>I laughed.</t308> <t309>I was thinking that Radar's parents actually appeared in the Guinness Book when I saw above us a beautiful African American woman with small pointed dreadlocks.</t309> <t310>It took me a few seconds to realize that it was Angela, Radar's girlfriend, I suppose.</t310>
<t311>—Hello —he said to me.</t311>
<t312>—Hello —I replied.</t312>
<t313>I knew Angela by sight because I had attended some class with her, but we didn't greet each other in the hallways or when we ran into each other around.</t313> <t314>I gestured for her to sit down and she pulled a chair up to the table.</t314>
<t315>—Guys, I suppose you know Marcus better than anyone —he said, using Radar's real name, with his elbows on the table.</t315>
<t316>—It's a shitty job, but someone has to do it —Ben replied, smiling.</t316>
<t317>—Do you think he's ashamed of me or something like that?</t317>
<t318>Ben laughed.</t318>
<t319>—What?</t319> <t320>No —he/she replied.</t320>
<t321>—Technically —I added—, you should be the one ashamed of him.</t321>
<t322>He looked up and smiled.</t322> <t323>A girl accustomed to compliments.</t323>
<t324>—Well, he has never invited me to go out with you all.</t324>
<t325>—Ahhh —I said; I finally got it—.</t325> <t326>That's because he's ashamed of us.</t326>
<t327>He laughed.</t327>
<t328>—You seem quite normal.</t328>
<t329>—You've never seen Ben snorting Sprite through his nose and blowing it out through his mouth —I told him.</t329>
<t330>—I am like a crazed carbonated fountain —added Ben, impassive.</t330>
<t331>—Honestly, guys, wouldn't you be worried?</t331> <t332>I don't know, we've been dating for five weeks and he hasn't even taken me to his house.</t332> <t333>—Ben and I exchanged a knowing look, and I scrunched up my face to keep from bursting into laughter—.</t333> <t334>What's going on? —asked Angela.</t334>
<t335>—Nothing —I replied—.</t335> <t336>Honestly, Angela, if he forced you to go out with us and took you to his house every other day...</t336>
<t337>—Without the slightest doubt, it would mean that she doesn't like you —finished Ben.</t337>
<t338>—Are your parents weird?</t338>
<t339>I thought about how to respond sincerely to their question.</t339>
<t340>—No, no.</t340> <t341>They are cool.</t341> <t342>Just a bit overprotective, I guess.</t342>
<t343>—Yes, overprotective —agreed Ben a little too quickly.</t343>
<t344>Angela smiled and stood up, saying that she had to go greet someone before lunchtime was over.</t344> <t345>Ben waited for her to leave before opening his mouth.</t345>
<t346>—This girl is impressive —he told me.</t346>
<t347>—I know —I replied—.</t347> <t348>I wonder if we could replace Radar with her.</t348>
<t349>—Although she surely isn't very good with computers.</t349> <t350>We need someone good.</t350> <t351>Besides, I bet she has no idea about Resurrection, our favorite video game.</t351> <t352>By the way, a good excuse is to say that Radar's parents are overprotective.</t352>
<t353>—Well, it's not my place to tell you —I replied.</t353>
<t354>—Let's see how long it takes to see the Radar Team Museum Residence —said Ben, smiling.</t354>
<t355>The break was almost over, so Ben and I got up and left the trays on the conveyor belt, the same one that Chuck Parson had thrown me onto in my freshman year, which sent me to the underworld of the Winter Park dishwasher crew.</t355> <t356>We headed to Radar's locker, and we were there when he came running, just after the first bell.</t356>
<t357>—In politics class, I decided that I would be willing to suck a donkey's balls, literally, if that could get me out of that class until the end of the term —he said.</t357>
<t358>—You can learn a lot about politics from a donkey's eggs —I replied—.</t358> <t359>Hey, speaking of the reasons why you should take the midday break an hour earlier, we just had lunch with Angela.</t359>
<t360>—Yes —said Ben, smiling smugly—, she wants to know why you have never taken her to your house.</t360>
<t361>Radar let out a long sigh as he turned the combination lock to open the locker.</t361> <t362>He exhaled so much air that I thought he was going to faint.</t362>
<t363>—Shit —he finally said.</t363>
<t364>—Are you ashamed of something? —I asked him, smiling.</t364>
<t365>—Shut up —he replied, giving me an elbow in the stomach.</t365>
<t366>—You live in a beautiful house —I said to her.</t366>
<t367>—Seriously, man —added Ben—.</t367> <t368>She is a really nice girl.</t368> <t369>I don't understand why you don't introduce her to your parents and show her the Radar Estate.</t369>
<t370>Radar threw his books into the locker and closed it.</t370> <t371>The noise of conversations around us quieted a bit as he looked up at the sky and shouted:</t371>
<t372>—IT'S NOT MY FAULT THAT MY PARENTS HAVE THE WORLD'S LARGEST COLLECTION OF BLACK SANTA CLAUSES.</t372>
<t373>Although I had heard Radar say "the world's largest collection of Black Santa Clauses" about a thousand times in my life, it never ceased to amuse me.</t373> <t374>But he wasn't joking.</t374> <t375>I remembered the first time I had gone to his house.</t375> <t376>I was about thirteen years old.</t376> <t377>It was spring, several months after Christmas, but the Santa Clauses were still on the window sills.</t377> <t378>Paper Black Santa Clauses hung from the stair railing.</t378> <t379>Candles with Black Santa Clauses adorned the dining table.</t379> <t380>A painting of a Black Santa Claus was hung above the fireplace, on whose mantel also stood figurines of Black Santa Clauses.</t380> <t381>They had a PEZ dispenser with a Black Santa Claus head bought in Namibia.</t381> <t382>The plastic, light-up Black Santa Claus that they placed in the tiny yard from Thanksgiving to New Year's spent the rest of the year proudly watching over a corner of the guest bathroom, a bathroom wallpapered with homemade paper featuring painted Black Santa Clauses and a sponge in the shape of Santa Claus.</t382> <t383>All the rooms in the house, except Radar's, were filled with Black Santa Clauses made of plaster, plastic, marble, clay, wood, resin, and fabric.</t383> <t384>In total, Radar's parents had more than twelve hundred Black Santa Clauses of all kinds.</t384> <t385>As stated on a plaque above the front door, Radar's house was an official Santa Claus Monument, according to the Christmas Society.</t385>
<t386>—You just have to tell her, man —I said to him—.</t386> <t387>You just have to say: "Angela, I really like you, but there's something you need to know: when we go to my house and we make out, two thousand four hundred eyes of twelve hundred black Santa Clauses will be watching us."</t387>
<t388>—Yes —agreed Radar, running a hand over his shaved head and nodding—.</t388> <t389>I don't think I'll tell him exactly like that, but I'll come up with something.</t389>
<t390>I went to the politics class, and Ben to an elective on video game design.</t390> <t391>I watched clocks during two more classes and, in the end, when I finished, my chest radiated relief.</t391> <t392>The end of each day was like a preview of our graduation, which was just over a month away.</t392>
<t393>I returned home.</t393> <t394>I ate two peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for a snack.</t394> <t395>I watched poker on TV.</t395> <t396>My parents arrived at six, they hugged each other and then hugged me.</t396> <t397>We had macaroni for dinner.</t397> <t398>They asked me about school.</t398> <t399>Then they asked me about the prom.</t399> <t400>They marveled at how well they had raised me.</t400> <t401>They told me that in their time they had to deal with people who weren't raised as well.</t401> <t402>They went to watch TV.</t402> <t403>I went to my room to check the mail.</t403> <t404>I wrote for a while about The Great Gatsby for literature class.</t404> <t405>I read The Federalist for a while to prepare in advance for the final politics exam.</t405> <t406>I chatted with Ben and then Radar logged on too.</t406> <t407>In our conversation, he used the phrase "the world's largest collection of black Santas" four times and I laughed each time.</t407> <t408>I told him I was glad he had a girlfriend.</t408> <t409>He said that summer would be great.</t409> <t410>I agreed.</t410> <t411>It was May 5th, but it could have been any other day.</t411> <t412>My days were peacefully identical to each other.</t412> <t413>I had always liked it.</t413> <t414>I liked the routine.</t414> <t415>I liked being bored.</t415> <t416>I didn't want to, but I liked it.</t416> <t417>And that's why that May 5th could have been any other day... until just before midnight, when Margo Roth Spiegelman opened my bedroom window, without a screen, for the first time since that night she had asked me to close it, nine years ago.</t417>
<t418>2</t418>
<t419>Upon hearing the window open, I turned around and saw Margo's blue eyes staring intently at me.</t419> <t420>At first, I only saw her eyes, but as soon as my vision adjusted, I realized that her face was painted black and she was wearing a black hoodie.</t420>
<t421>—Are you practicing cybersex? —he asked me.</t421>
<t422>—I'm chatting with Ben Starling.</t422>
<t423>—That doesn't answer my question, pervert.</t423>
<t424>I laughed awkwardly and then approached the window, knelt down, and positioned myself just a few centimeters from his face.</t424> <t425>I couldn't imagine why he was there, at my window, with his face painted.</t425>
<t426>—To what do I owe the pleasure? —I asked him.</t426>
<t427>Margo and I still had a good vibe, I suppose, but not to the point of meeting in the middle of the night with our faces painted black.</t427> <t428>For that, she already had her friends, surely.</t428> <t429>I was not among them.</t429>
<t430>—I need your car —he explained to me.</t430>
<t431>—I don't have a car —I replied, and it was a topic I preferred not to discuss.</t431>
<t432>—Well, then your mother's.</t432>
<t433>—You have a car —I commented to him.</t433>
<t434>Margo puffed out her cheeks and sighed.</t434>
<t435>—True, but it turns out that my parents have taken the car keys from me and put them in a safe, which they left under their bed, and Myrna Mountweazel, the dog, is sleeping in their room.</t435> <t436>And Myrna Mountweazel has a damn stroke every time she sees me.</t436> <t437>So, I could perfectly sneak into the room, steal the safe, break it open, grab the keys, and take off, but the thing is, it's not worth trying because Myrna Mountweazel will start barking like crazy as soon as I peek through the door.</t437> <t438>So, as I was saying, I need a car.</t438> <t439>And I also need you to drive, because tonight I have to do eleven things, and at least five require someone to be waiting for me to make a quick getaway.</t439>
<t440>When I didn't focus my gaze, Margo was all eyes floating in space.</t440> <t441>Then I would refocus and see the outline of her face, the paint still wet on her skin.</t441> <t442>Her cheekbones triangulated towards her chin, and her lips, black as coal, barely formed a smile.</t442>
<t443>—Any crime? —I asked him.</t443>
<t444>—Hmm —Margo replied to me—.</t444> <t445>Remind me if breaking and entering is a crime.</t445>
<t446>—No —I replied in a firm tone.</t446>
<t447>—Is it not a crime, or are you not going to help me?</t447>
<t448>—I'm not going to help you.</t448> <t449>Can't you recruit one of your subordinates to take you?</t449>
<t450>Lacey and/or Becca always did what she said.</t450>
<t451>—The truth is that they are part of the problem —Margo told me.</t451>
<t452>—What problem? —I asked him.</t452>
<t453>—There are eleven problems —he answered me with some impatience.</t453>
<t454>—Without crimes —I said.</t454>
<t455>—I swear to God that I will not ask you to commit any crime.</t455>
<t456>And at that precise moment, all the lights surrounding Margo's house turned on.</t456> <t457>In a quick movement, she jumped through my window, got into my room, and threw herself under my bed.</t457>
<t458>In a matter of seconds, his father came out into the yard.</t458>
<t459>—Margo! —he shouted—.</t459> <t460>I saw you!</t460>
<t461>From under the bed came a muffled "Oh, damn."</t461> <t462>Margo quickly got out, stood up, approached the window, and said:</t462>
<t463>—Let's go, Dad.</t463> <t464>I'm just trying to chat with Quentin.</t464> <t465>You spend the whole day telling me that he would be a fantastic influence and all that.</t465>
<t466>"Are you just chatting with Quentin?"</t466>
<t467>—Yes.</t467>
<t468>—And then why did you paint your face black?</t468>
<t469>Margo hesitated for just a moment.</t469>
<t470>—Dad, answering that question would take hours and I know you're probably very tired, so go back to...</t470>
<t471>—Home! —he shouted—.</t471> <t472>Right now!</t472>
<t473>Margo grabbed me by the shirt, whispered in my ear "I'll be back in a minute," and went out the window.</t473>
<t474>As soon as he left, I grabbed the car keys from the table.</t474> <t475>The keys are mine, although the tragic part is that the car isn't.</t475> <t476>When I turned sixteen, my parents gave me a very small gift.</t476> <t477>I knew as soon as they gave it to me that it was car keys, and I almost peed myself, because they had told me a thousand times that they couldn't buy me a car.</t477> <t478>But when they handed me the wrapped little box, I thought they had been joking and that I would finally have a car.</t478> <t479>I took off the wrapping and opened the little box, which indeed contained a key.</t479>
<t480>I observed it and discovered that it was the key to a Chrysler.</t480> <t481>The key to a Chrysler minivan.</t481> <t482>Exactly to my mother's Chrysler minivan.</t482>
<t483>—Will you give me a key to your car? —I asked my mother.</t483>
<t484>—Tom —he said to my father—, I told you I would give him false hopes.</t484>
<t485>—Don't blame me —my father replied to him—.</t485> <t486>You are sublimating your own frustrations about my salary.</t486>
<t487>—Doesn't this analysis you're giving me have a bit of passive aggression? —my mother asked him.</t487>
<t488>—And aren't accusations of passive aggression passive aggressions by nature? —my father replied.</t488>
<t489>And they continued like that for a while.</t489>
<t490>The issue was the following: I would have access to that vehicular phenomenon that is the latest model Chrysler minivan, except when my mother used it.</t490> <t491>And since my mother drove to work every morning, I could only use it on weekends.</t491> <t492>Well, on weekends and in the middle of the damn night.</t492>
<t493>Margo took longer than the promised minute to return to my window, though not much longer.</t493> <t494>But during her absence, I began to change my mind.</t494>
<t495>—I have class tomorrow —I told him.</t495>
<t496>—Yes, I know —Margo replied to me—.</t496> <t497>We have class tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow, and if I think about it too much, I'll end up going crazy.</t497> <t498>So yes, it is a night before class.</t498> <t499>That's why we have to leave now, because we need to be back by morning.</t499>
<t500>—I don't know…</t500>
<t501>—Q —he told me—.</t501> <t502>Q. Darling.</t502> <t503>How long have we been very good friends?</t503>
<t504>—We are not friends.</t504> <t505>We are neighbors.</t505>
<t506>—Damn, Q. Am I not nice to you?</t506> <t507>Don't I tell my buddies to treat you well at school?</t507>
<t508>—Ugh —I replied warily, although the truth was that I had always assumed it was Margo who had prevented Chuck Parson and his ilk from messing with us.</t508>
<t509>Blinked.</t509> <t510>She had painted her eyelids black.</t510>
<t511>—Q —he told me—, we have to go.</t511>
<t512>And I went.</t512> <t513>I jumped out the window and we ran along the side wall of my house with our heads down until we opened the doors of the minivan.</t513> <t514>Margo whispered to me not to close the doors —too much noise—, so, with the doors open, I put the car in neutral, pushed off with my foot on the asphalt, and the minivan rolled down the driveway.</t514> <t515>We moved slowly past a couple of houses and then I turned on the engine and the lights.</t515> <t516>We closed the doors and I drove through the winding streets of the endless Jefferson Park, with its houses that still looked new and plastic, like a toy town that housed tens of thousands of real people.</t516>
<t517>Margo began to speak.</t517>
<t518>—The thing is, they don't even care, they just think my exploits make them look bad.</t518> <t519>Do you know what my father just told me?</t519> <t520>He said: "I don't care if you screw up your life, but don't embarrass us in front of the Jacobsens.</t520> <t521>They are our friends."</t521> <t522>Ridiculous.</t522> <t523>And you can't imagine how hard it was for me to get out of that damn house.</t523> <t524>Have you seen those movies where they escape from jail and put clothes under the sheets to make it look like there's someone in the bed?</t524> <t525>—I nodded—.</t525> <t526>Yeah, well, my mother put a crappy baby monitor in my room to hear my breathing all night while I sleep.</t526> <t527>So I had to give Ruthie five bucks to sleep in my room, and then I got dressed in hers.</t527> <t528>—Ruthie is Margo's younger sister—.</t528> <t529>Now it's a damn Mission Impossible.</t529> <t530>It used to be about sneaking out like in any normal damn house, climbing out the window and jumping, but, damn, lately it's like living in a fascist dictatorship.</t530>
<t531>—Are you going to tell me where we are going?</t531>
<t532>—Well, first we will go to Publix.</t532> <t533>Because, for reasons that I will explain to you later, I need you to buy me some things at the supermarket.</t533> <t534>And then we will go to Walmart.</t534>
<t535>—What? Are we going to tour all the stores in Florida? —I asked him.</t535>
<t536>—Honey, tonight you and I are going to correct a bunch of mistakes.</t536> <t537>And we are going to introduce mistakes into some things that are right.</t537> <t538>The first will be last, the last will be first, and the meek shall inherit the earth.</t538> <t539>But before we can totally reorganize the world, we have to buy several things.</t539>
<t540>So I pulled into the Publix parking lot, almost empty, and parked.</t540>
<t541>—Hey, how much money do you have on you? —he asked me.</t541>
<t542>—Zero dollars and zero cents —I replied to him.</t542>
<t543>I turned off the engine and looked at her.</t543> <t544>She put a hand into a pocket of her dark, tight jeans and pulled out several hundred-dollar bills.</t544>
<t545>—Luckily, God has provided —he answered me.</t545>
<t546>—What the hell is this? —I asked him.</t546>
<t547>—Bat mitzvah money, idiot.</t547> <t548>I don't have permission to access the account, but I know my parents' password because they use "myrnamountw3az3l" for everything.</t548> <t549>So I withdrew money.</t549>
<t550>I tried to hide my surprise, but she noticed how I was looking at her and smiled at me smugly.</t550>
<t551>—It will basically be the best night of your life.</t551>
<t552>3</t552>
<t553>The problem with Margo Roth Spiegelman was that the only thing I could really do was let her talk, and when she stopped, encourage her to keep talking, for the simple reason that: 1) I was indisputably in love with her; 2) she was an unprecedented girl no matter how you looked at it, and 3) the truth is that she never asked me anything, so the only way to avoid silence was for her to keep talking.</t553>
<t554>Already in the Publix parking lot, he told me:</t554>
<t555>—Well, let's see.</t555> <t556>I've made a list for you.</t556> <t557>If you have any questions, call me on my mobile.</t557> <t558>Oh, now that I think about it, earlier I took the liberty of putting some provisions in the back of the car.</t558>
<t559>—What? Before I agreed to get involved?</t559>
<t560>—Well, yes.</t560> <t561>Technically, yes.</t561> <t562>Anyway, call me if you have any questions, but grab the jar of Vaseline that's bigger than your fist.</t562> <t563>There's small Vaseline, medium Vaseline, and a huge Vaseline, which is the one you need to get.</t563> <t564>If they don't have it, get three of the medium ones.</t564> <t565>—He handed me the list and a hundred-dollar bill, and said—: This should be enough.</t565>
<t566>Margo's list:</t566>
<t567>3 Whole Catfish, Wrapped Separately.</t567>
<t568>Veet (for shaving your legs without a razor, it's with cosmetics for women)</t568>
<t569>Vaseline</t569>
<t570>a pack of six cans of Mountain Dew soda</t570>
<t571>A Dozen Tulips</t571>
<t572>a Bottle of water</t572>
<t573>Tissues</t573>
<t574>a blue spray paint</t574>
<t575>—Your capital letters are very interesting —I told him.</t575>
<t576>—Yes, I firmly believe in random capitalization.</t576> <t577>The rules of capitalization are very unfair to the words in the middle.</t577>
<t578>I'm not quite sure what you're supposed to say to the supermarket cashier at half past midnight when you place six kilos of catfish, Veet, a giant jar of Vaseline, a six-pack of orange soda, a can of blue spray paint, and a dozen tulips on the conveyor belt.</t578> <t579>But what I said was:</t579>
<t580>—It's not as strange as it seems.</t580>
<t581>The woman cleared her throat, but did not raise her gaze.</t581>
<t582>—Well, it seems so —he murmured.</t582>
<t583>—I really don't want to get into trouble —I told Margo as I got back to the car while she wiped the black paint off her face with the water bottle and tissues.</t583> <t584>Apparently, she had only painted herself to leave her house—.</t584> <t585>The admission letter from Duke University explicitly states that they will not accept me if I get arrested by the police.</t585>
<t586>—You are too nervous, Q.</t586>
<t587>—Let's not get into trouble, please —I said to him—.</t587> <t588>Well, I think it's fine that we have fun and all that, but not at the expense of my future.</t588>
<t589>He looked up at me, with almost his entire face clean, and gave me a slight smile.</t589>
<t590>—I'm surprised that all that crap can seem remotely interesting to you.</t590>
<t591>—How?</t591>
<t592>—To go or not to go to university.</t592> <t593>To get into trouble or not to get into trouble.</t593> <t594>To get an excellent grade or a very poor grade in school.</t594> <t595>To have or not to have a professional future.</t595> <t596>To have a big house or a small one, owned or rented.</t596> <t597>To have or not to have money.</t597> <t598>It's very boring.</t598>
<t599>I started to tell her that obviously she cared a little too, because she got good grades and that's why the following year she would enter a high-performance program at the University of Florida, but Margo simply replied:</t599>
<t600>—Walmart.</t600>
<t601>We entered Walmart and grabbed a security bar to secure the steering wheel.</t601>
<t602>—Why do we need the bar? —I asked Margo as we moved through the youth section.</t602>
<t603>Margo managed to unleash one of her usual frenetic monologues without answering my question.</t603>
<t604>—Did you know that, for almost the entire history of the human species, the average lifespan has been less than thirty years?</t604> <t605>They had about ten years of adult life, right?</t605> <t606>They didn't plan for retirement.</t606> <t607>They didn't plan their professional career.</t607> <t608>They didn't plan anything.</t608> <t609>They didn't have time to make plans.</t609> <t610>They didn't have time to think about the future.</t610> <t611>But then life expectancy started to increase and people began to have more and more future, so they spent more time thinking about it.</t611> <t612>About the future.</t612> <t613>And now life has become the future.</t613> <t614>You live every moment of your life for the future…</t614> <t615>You go to high school so you can go to college, and that way you can find a good job, and that way you can buy a nice house, and that way you can afford to send your kids to college so they can find a good job and that way they can buy a nice house and that way they can afford to send their kids to college.</t615>
<t616>I got the impression that Margo was rambling to avoid my question, so I repeated it.</t616>
<t617>—Why do we need the bar?</t617>
<t618>Margo gave me a gentle slap on the back.</t618>
<t619>—Well, it's clear that you will find out tonight.</t619>
<t620>And then, in the nautical section, Margo found an air horn.</t620> <t621>She took it out of the box and raised her arm.</t621>
<t622>—No —I told him.</t622>
<t623>—No what? —he asked me.</t623>
<t624>—Don't honk the horn —I replied to him.</t624>
<t625>Although when I was on the "t" of "toques", he pressed and the horn let out a dreadful buzz that resonated in my head like the auditory equivalent of a stroke.</t625>
<t626>—Sorry.</t626> <t627>I didn't hear you.</t627> <t628>What were you saying? —he asked me.</t628>
<t629>—Stop t…</t629>
<t630>And he honked the horn again.</t630>
<t631>An employee from Walmart, somewhat older than us, approached.</t631>
<t632>—Uh, you can't use it here —he told us.</t632>
<t633>—Sorry, I didn't know —Margo replied with apparent sincerity.</t633>
<t634>—Relax.</t634> <t635>The truth is, I don't care.</t635>
<t636>And the conversation seemed settled, but the boy couldn't stop looking at Margo, and honestly, I don't blame him, because it's hard to stop looking at her.</t636>
<t637>—What are you going to do tonight, guys? —the employee finally asked.</t637>
<t638>—Not much —Margo replied—.</t638> <t639>And you?</t639>
<t640>—I leave at one and then I'll go to a bar in Orange.</t640> <t641>If you want to come...</t641> <t642>But you have to leave your brother at home.</t642> <t643>They are very strict with the ID card.</t643>
<t644>His what?</t644>
<t645>—I am not your brother —I told him, with my gaze fixed on his sneakers.</t645>
<t646>And then Margo kept lying.</t646>
<t647>—The truth is that he is my cousin —she told him.</t647> <t648>She positioned herself next to me, put her hand around my waist, so that I felt each of her tense fingers on my hip, and added—: And my lover.</t648>
<t649>The boy looked at the ceiling and left.</t649> <t650>Margo left her hand on my waist for a moment, and I took the opportunity to wrap my arm around her as well.</t650>
<t651>—You are my favorite cousin —I told her.</t651>
<t652>She smiled, gave me a little bump with her hip, and stepped aside.</t652>
<t653>—As if I didn't know —he replied to me.</t653>
<t654>4</t654>
<t655>We were driving on a providentially empty highway, and I was following Margo's directions.</t655> <t656>The dashboard clock read 1:07.</t656>
<t657>—It's beautiful, isn't it? —she asked me.</t657> <t658>Since she had turned to look out the window, I could barely see her—.</t658> <t659>I love driving fast by the light of the street lamps.</t659>
<t660>—Light —I said—, the visible reminder of the Invisible Light.</t660>
<t661>—How beautiful.</t661>
<t662>—T. S. Eliot —I added—.</t662> <t663>You read it too.</t663> <t664>In last year's literature class.</t664>
<t665>In reality, I had not read the entire poem to which that verse belonged, but some fragments had stuck in my mind.</t665>
<t666>—Ah, it's a date —she told me, a little disappointed.</t666>
<t667>I saw his hand in the central glove compartment.</t667> <t668>I could have put mine in as well, and our hands would have been in the same place at the same time.</t668> <t669>But I didn't.</t669>
<t670>—Repeat it —he asked me.</t670>
<t671>—Light, the visible reminder of the Invisible Light.</t671>
<t672>—Yeah, damn, it's good.</t672> <t673>It must work with your fling.</t673>
<t674>—Exligue —I corrected her.</t674>
<t675>—Did Suzie stand you up? —Margo asked me.</t675>
<t676>—How do you know it was her who stood me up?</t676>
<t677>—Oh, sorry.</t677>
<t678>—Although she did stand me up —I admitted.</t678>
<t679>Margo laughed.</t679> <t680>We had broken up months ago, but I didn't blame Margo for not paying attention to the world of second-rate flings.</t680> <t681>What happens in the rehearsal room stays in the rehearsal room.</t681>
<t682>Margo had put her feet on the dashboard and was moving her toes to the rhythm of her words.</t682> <t683>She always spoke like that, with that perceptible rhythm, as if she were reciting poetry.</t683>
<t684>—Okay, well, I'm sorry.</t684> <t685>But I understand it.</t685> <t686>The handsome guy who is my boyfriend has been screwing my best friend for months.</t686>
<t687>I looked at her, but since she had all her hair in her face, I couldn't tell if she was joking.</t687>
<t688>—Really? —He didn't say anything—.</t688> <t689>But this very morning you were laughing with him.</t689> <t690>I saw you.</t690>
<t691>—I don't know what you're talking about.</t691> <t692>I found out before the first class, then I ran into them chatting and I started screaming like a madwoman, Becca hugged Clint Bauer, and Jase just stood there like an idiot, with sticky drool dripping from his stinking mouth.</t692>
<t693>It was clear that he had misunderstood the scene in the lobby.</t693>
<t694>—How strange, because Chuck Parson asked me this morning what I knew about you and Jase.</t694>
<t695>—Yes, well, Chuck does what he's told, I suppose.</t695> <t696>Surely Jase had ordered him to find out who knew.</t696>
<t697>—Damn, why would he hook up with Becca?</t697>
<t698>—Well, she's not famous for her personality or her generosity, so it must be because she's hot.</t698>
<t699>—She's not as good as you —I told her without thinking twice.</t699>
<t700>—It has always seemed ridiculous to me that people want to be with someone just because they are good-looking.</t700> <t701>It's like choosing breakfast cereal based on color, not on taste.</t701> <t702>It's the next exit, by the way.</t702> <t703>But I'm not pretty, at least not up close.</t703> <t704>In general, the closer people get to me, the less pretty I seem to them.</t704>
<t705>—It’s not… —I began to say.</t705>
<t706>—It doesn't matter —he replied to me.</t706>
<t707>I found it unfair that an asshole like Jason Worthington could have sex with Margo and Becca, while perfectly nice individuals like me don't have the privilege of having sex with either of them... or with anyone else, to be honest.</t707> <t708>That said, I like to think that I'm the kind of person who wouldn't hook up with Becca Arrington.</t708> <t709>She might be hot, but she's also: 1) incredibly dull, and 2) a total and absolute bitch.</t709> <t710>Those of us in the rehearsal room have long suspected that Becca maintains her gorgeous figure because she eats nothing but the souls of kittens and the dreams of poor children.</t710>
<t711>—Becca is disgusting —I said to bring Margo back into the conversation.</t711>
<t712>—Yes —he replied, looking out the window.</t712>
<t713>Her hair reflected the light from the street lamps.</t713> <t714>For a second, I thought she might be crying, but she quickly recovered, put on her hood, and took the security bar out of the Walmart bag.</t714>
<t715>—Well, we're definitely going to have fun —he said while unwrapping the safety bar.</t715>
<t716>—Can I ask you now where we are going?</t716>
<t717>—Becca's house —he answered me.</t717>
<t718>—Oh, no —I said, stopping at a stop sign.</t718>
<t719>With the car in neutral, I started telling Margo that I was taking her home.</t719>
<t720>—We will not commit any crime.</t720> <t721>I promise you.</t721> <t722>We have to find Jase's car.</t722> <t723>Becca's street is the first on the right, but Jase wouldn't have parked on her street because Becca's parents are home.</t723> <t724>Let's try the next one.</t724> <t725>It's the first thing we need to do.</t725>
<t726>—Agreed —I said to him—, but then we go back home.</t726>
<t727>—No, then we move on to the second part of eleven.</t727>
<t728>—Margo, it's not a good idea.</t728>
<t729>—Just drive —he replied to me.</t729>
<t730>And that's what I did.</t730> <t731>We found Jase's Lexus two blocks from Becca's street, parked in a dead-end street.</t731> <t732>Margo jumped out of the minivan with the steering wheel lock in her hand even before we had completely stopped.</t732> <t733>She opened the driver's door of the Lexus, sat down, and placed the steering wheel lock on Jase's steering wheel.</t733> <t734>Then she carefully closed the car door.</t734>
<t735>—The son of a bitch never locks the car —he murmured as he got back into the minivan.</t735> <t736>He put the bar key in his pocket, extended an arm, and ran his hand through my hair—.</t736> <t737>First part done.</t737> <t738>Now, to Becca's house.</t738>
<t739>While driving, Margo explained the second part and the third to me.</t739>
<t740>—A brilliant idea —I told him, although inside my nerves were about to explode.</t740>
<t741>I turned onto Becca Street and parked two houses down from her McMansion.</t741> <t742>Margo crawled to the back of the car and returned with binoculars and a digital camera.</t742> <t743>She looked through the binoculars and then handed them to me.</t743> <t744>I saw light in the basement, but there was no movement.</t744> <t745>What surprised me the most was that the house had a basement, because in much of Orlando you can't dig very deep without hitting water.</t745>
<t746>I put my hand in my pocket, took out my phone, and dialed the number Margo had given me.</t746> <t747>It rang once, twice, and then a sleepy male voice answered:</t747>
<t748>—Yes?</t748>
<t749>—Mr. Arrington? —I asked.</t749>
<t750>Margo wanted me to call because there was no chance they would recognize my voice.</t750>
<t751>—Who is it? Shit, what time is it?</t751>
<t752>—Sir, I think you should know that your daughter is currently having sex with Jason Worthington in the basement.</t752>
<t753>And I hung up.</t753> <t754>Second part ready.</t754>
<t755>Margo and I opened the car doors and crouched down as we moved towards the hedge that surrounded Becca's yard.</t755> <t756>Margo handed me the camera and I watched as the light of a room on the first floor turned on, then the light of the staircase, and next the light of the kitchen.</t756> <t757>Finally, the one on the basement stairs.</t757>
<t758>—He's coming out —Margo whispered.</t758>
<t759>I didn't know what he was referring to until, out of the corner of my eye, I saw Jason Worthington peeking through the basement window without a shirt.</t759> <t760>He started running across the lawn in his underwear and, as he approached, I stood up and took a picture of him, thus completing the third part.</t760> <t761>I think the flash surprised both of us.</t761> <t762>For a fleeting moment, he looked at me blinking in the darkness and then disappeared into the night.</t762>
<t763>Margo tugged at the leg of my jeans.</t763> <t764>I looked down and saw her grinning from ear to ear.</t764> <t765>I extended my hand, helped her up, and we ran towards the car.</t765> <t766>I was putting the key in the ignition when she said to me:</t766>
<t767>—Let me see the photo.</t767>
<t768>I handed over the camera and we watched the photo appear together, with our heads almost touching.</t768> <t769>Seeing Jason Worthington's pale and surprised face, I couldn't help but laugh.</t769>
<t770>—Damn! —exclaimed Margo, pointing at the photo.</t770>
<t771>Apparently, in the rush of the moment, Jason hadn't been able to tuck the little bird inside his underwear, so there it was, hanging, digitally captured for posterity.</t771>
<t772>—It is a penis in the same sense that Rhode Island is a state —said Margo—:</t772> <t773>Its history may be illustrious, but it is certainly not long.</t773>
<t774>I turned my face towards the house and saw that they had already turned off the basement light.</t774> <t775>I found myself feeling a little bad for Jason.</t775> <t776>It wasn't his fault that he had a micropenis and an awesome, vengeful girlfriend.</t776> <t777>But then I remembered that, when we were in sixth grade, Jase promised not to punch me in the arm if I ate a live worm, so I ate a live worm, and then he punched me in the face.</t777> <t778>So it didn't take long for me to stop feeling bad.</t778>
<t779>When I looked at Margo, she was observing the house with binoculars.</t779>
<t780>—We have to go into the basement —he told me.</t780>
<t781>—What? Why?</t781>
<t782>—Fourth part: take his clothes in case he tries to sneak back into the house.</t782> <t783>Fifth part: leave the fish for Becca.</t783>
<t784>—No.</t784>
<t785>—Yes.</t785> <t786>Now —he told me—.</t786> <t787>She's upstairs enduring the lecture from her parents.</t787> <t788>But how long will the sermon last?</t788> <t789>Well, what do you think? "You shouldn't be making out with Margo's boyfriend in the basement."</t789> <t790>It's basically a one-sentence sermon, so we need to hurry.</t790>
<t791>He got out of the car with the spray paint in one hand and a catfish in the other.</t791>
<t792>—It's not a good idea —I whispered.</t792>
<t793>But I crouched down, like her, and followed her to the basement window, which was still open.</t793>
<t794>—I'll go in first —he told me.</t794>
<t795>He put his feet through the window and rested them on Becca's computer desk.</t795> <t796>He had half of his body inside the house, and the other half outside, when I asked him:</t796>
<t797>—Can't I stay and keep watch?</t797>
<t798>—Move your ass already —he replied to me.</t798>
<t799>And I did it.</t799> <t800>I quickly picked up all of Jason's clothes that I saw on Becca's lilac carpet: some jeans with a leather belt, some flip-flops, a baseball cap with the Winter Park Wildcats logo, and a sky-blue t-shirt.</t800> <t801>I turned to Margo, who handed me the wrapped fish and one of Becca's bright violet colored pencils.</t801> <t802>She told me what to write: "Message from Margo Roth Spiegelman: Your friendship with her sleeps with the fishes."</t802>
<t803>Margo hid the fish in Becca's closet, among folded shorts.</t803> <t804>I heard footsteps upstairs, tapped Margo on the shoulder, and looked at her with wide eyes.</t804> <t805>She just smiled and calmly opened the spray paint.</t805> <t806>I jumped out the window, turned around, and saw Margo leaning over the table, calmly shaking the paint.</t806> <t807>With an elegant movement —the kind that makes you think of a calligraphy notebook or Zorro— she painted the letter M on the wall, above the table.</t807>
<t808>She extended her hands towards me and I pulled her up.</t808> <t809>She was almost standing when we heard a high-pitched voice screaming: "DWIGHT!".</t809> <t810>I grabbed the clothes and ran out.</t810> <t811>Margo followed me.</t811>
<t812>I heard the front door of Becca's house opening, although I didn't see it, but I neither stopped nor turned around when a thunderous voice shouted "STOP!", not even when I heard the unmistakable sound of a shotgun being loaded.</t812>
<t813>I heard Margo mutter "shotgun" behind me —she didn't seem upset, she had merely made an observation—, and then, instead of moving forward along Becca's hedge, I dove headfirst over it.</t813> <t814>I don't know how I thought I would land —maybe a skillful somersault or something like that—, but the fact is I ended up falling on my left shoulder in the middle of the road.</t814> <t815>Luckily, Jase's clothes hit the ground before I did and cushioned the fall a bit.</t815>
<t816>I let out a curse, and before I had even started to get up, I felt Margo's hands pulling me.</t816> <t817>In a second we were in the car, and I backed up without turning on the lights, which is more or less how I passed through the almost deserted torpedo station of the Wildcats baseball team from Winter Park.</t817> <t818>Jase was running at full speed, but he didn't seem to be heading anywhere in particular.</t818> <t819>I felt another pang of remorse as I passed by him, so I rolled down the window halfway and threw him the shirt.</t819> <t820>I don't think he saw either Margo or me, luckily.</t820> <t821>There was no reason for him to recognize the minivan either, given that —and I don't want to sound bitter by insisting on this— I can't use it to go to school.</t821>
<t822>—Why the hell did you do that? —Margo asked me.</t822>
<t823>I turned on the lights and, already moving forward, I entered the labyrinth of streets heading towards the highway.</t823>
<t824>—I felt sorry.</t824>
<t825>—Has it made you sad? Why?</t825> <t826>Because he has been deceiving me for a month and a half?</t826> <t827>Because he has probably given me who knows what disease?</t827> <t828>Because he is an idiot and a disgusting person who will probably be rich and happy all his life, which proves that the universe is absolutely unjust?</t828>
<t829>—He seemed desperate —I replied to him.</t829>
<t830>—It doesn't matter.</t830> <t831>Let's go to Karin's house.</t831> <t832>It's on Pennsylvania Avenue, near the ABC liquor store.</t832>
<t833>—Don't get mad at me —I told him—.</t833> <t834>A guy just pointed a fucking shotgun at me for helping you, so don't get mad at me.</t834>
<t835>—I'M NOT MAD AT YOU! —shouted Margo, punching the dashboard.</t835>
<t836>—Well, you're shouting.</t836>
<t837>—I thought that maybe… Never mind.</t837> <t838>I thought that maybe I wasn't being deceived.</t838>
<t839>—How?</t839>
<t840>—Karin told me at the institute.</t840> <t841>And I suppose a lot of people had known for a long time.</t841> <t842>But no one had told me.</t842> <t843>I thought Karin just wanted to stir things up or something like that.</t843>
<t844>—I'm sorry —I said to him.</t844>
<t845>—Yes, yes.</t845> <t846>It's hard for me to believe that I care.</t846>
<t847>—My heart is racing —I added.</t847>
<t848>—That's how you know you're having fun —Margo replied to me.</t848>
<t849>But it didn't seem fun to me.</t849> <t850>What it seemed like was that I was going to have a heart attack.</t850> <t851>I entered the parking lot of a 7-Eleven, put a finger to my jugular, and checked my pulse on the digital watch that blinked every second.</t851> <t852>When I turned towards Margo, I saw her rolling her eyes to the sky.</t852>
<t853>—My pulse is dangerously accelerated —I explained to him.</t853>
<t854>—I don't even remember the last time I got so worked up over something like this.</t854> <t855>Adrenaline in my throat and my lungs swollen.</t855>
<t856>—Inhale through your nose and exhale through your mouth —I replied.</t856>
<t857>—All your little worries.</t857> <t858>It's so…</t858>
<t859>—Beautiful?</t859>
<t860>—Is that what they call immaturity these days? —he asked me, smiling.</t860>
<t861>Margo slipped into the back seat and returned with a bag.</t861> <t862>“How much crap has she stuffed back there?” I thought.</t862> <t863>She opened the bag and took out a bottle of nail polish so dark red it looked black.</t863>
<t864>—While you calm down, I'll paint my nails —she said to me, looking at me through her bangs and smiling—.</t864> <t865>Take all the time you need.</t865>
<t866>And we sat there, she with her nail polish on the dashboard, and I taking my pulse with a trembling finger.</t866> <t867>The color of the nail polish wasn't bad, and Margo had pretty fingers, thinner and bonier than the rest of her body, all curves and soft bumps.</t867> <t868>She had fingers that made you want to intertwine them.</t868> <t869>I remembered them against my hip at Walmart and it felt like several days had passed.</t869> <t870>My heart returned to its normal rhythm and I tried to tell myself: Margo is right.</t870> <t871>There is nothing to fear on this quiet night, in this small town.</t871>
<t872>5</t872>
<t873>—Part six —said Margo as soon as we started moving again.</t873> <t874>She moved her nails in the air as if she were playing the piano—.</t874> <t875>Leave flowers on Karin's doorstep with an apology note.</t875>
<t876>—What did you do to him?</t876>
<t877>—Well, when she told me about Jase, I somehow killed the messenger.</t877>
<t878>—How? —I asked him.</t878>
<t879>We were approaching a traffic light and next to us some kids in a sports car revved their engine... as if it would ever cross my mind to race with the Chrysler.</t879> <t880>When you stepped on the gas, it groaned.</t880>
<t881>—Well, I don't remember exactly what I called her, but it was something like "crybaby, disgusting, idiot, pimple-backed, crooked teeth, fat-assed bitch with the most horrible hair in Florida... which is saying something."</t881>
<t882>—His hair is ridiculous —I observed.</t882>
<t883>—I know.</t883> <t884>It was the only truth I told him.</t884> <t885>When you say awful things to someone, you shouldn't tell them any truth, because then you can't completely take it back and be sincere, you know?</t885> <t886>That is to say, there are highlights.</t886> <t887>There are also streaks.</t887> <t888>And then there are skunk stripes.</t888>
<t889>As we were heading to Karin's house, Margo moved to the back and returned to the front seat with the bouquet of tulips.</t889> <t890>Attached to the stem of one of them was a note that Margo had folded to look like an envelope.</t890> <t891>I stopped the car, she handed me the bouquet, I ran across the sidewalk, left the flowers on Karin's front step, and ran back.</t891>
<t892>"Seventh part," he told me as soon as I got into the car, "Leave a fish for the pleasant Mr. Worthington."</t892>
<t893>—I'm afraid he still hasn't arrived home —I told him with just the slightest hint of sorrow in my voice.</t893>
<t894>—I hope the cops find him barefoot, desperate, and naked in a ditch somewhere in a week —Margo replied to me without flinching.</t894>
<t895>—Remind me to never make Margo Roth Spiegelman angry —I murmured.</t895>
<t896>And Margo laughed.</t896>
<t897>—Now seriously —he told me—.</t897> <t898>We are unleashing the storm upon our enemies.</t898>
<t899>—Your enemies —I corrected her.</t899>
<t900>—We'll see —he answered me instantly, and then he reacted and said to me—: Hey, I'll take care of this part.</t900> <t901>The problem at Jason's house is that they have an excellent security system.</t901> <t902>And we can't afford another panic attack.</t902>
<t903>—Hmm —I said.</t903>
<t904>Jason lived just at the end of Karin's street, in a super-rich development called Casavilla.</t904> <t905>All the houses in Casavilla are Spanish-style, with red tiles and all that, except they weren't built by the Spanish.</t905> <t906>They were built by Jason's father, one of the richest real estate developers in Florida.</t906>
<t907>—Big and ugly houses for big and ugly people —I said to Margo as I parked in Casavilla.</t907>
<t908>—You said it.</t908> <t909>If I ever end up being one of those people who have a child and seven bedrooms, do me a favor and shoot me.</t909>
<t910>We parked in front of Jase's house, an architectural monstrosity that looked like an immense Spanish hacienda, except for three Doric columns that rose up to the roof.</t910> <t911>Margo grabbed the second catfish from the back seat, took the cap off a pen with her teeth, and scribbled in a handwriting different from her own: "The love MS felt for you Sleeps With the Fishes."</t911>
<t912>—Hey, leave the car running —he said to me, putting on Jase's baseball cap backwards.</t912>
<t913>—Agreed —I replied to him.</t913>
<t914>—Ready to leave —he added.</t914>
<t915>—Agreed.</t915>
<t916>And I felt my pulse quicken.</t916> <t917>«Inhale through the nose, exhale through the mouth.</t917> <t918>Inhale through the nose, exhale through the mouth».</t918> <t919>With the fish and the spray in her hands, Margo opened the door, ran across the wide Worthington lawn, and hid behind an oak tree.</t919> <t920>She gestured to me in the darkness, I returned the gesture, and then she breathed dramatically and deeply, her cheeks puffed out, she turned, and took off running.</t920>
<t921>He had taken only one stride when the house lit up like a municipal Christmas tree and a siren started blaring.</t921> <t922>For a moment I considered abandoning Margo to her fate, but I kept inhaling through my nose and exhaling through my mouth as she ran towards the house.</t922> <t923>She threw the fish through the window, but the sirens were so loud that I could barely hear the glass breaking.</t923> <t924>And then, since we are talking about Margo Roth Spiegelman, she took a moment to carefully paint a nice M on the part of the window that hadn't broken.</t924> <t925>Then she ran towards the car, I had one foot on the accelerator and the other on the brake, and at that moment the Chrysler felt like a racing thoroughbred.</t925> <t926>Margo ran so fast that her cap flew off, she jumped into the car and we zoomed off before she had even closed the door.</t926>
<t927>I stopped at the stop sign at the end of the street.</t927>
<t928>—What the hell are you doing?</t928> <t929>Keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going —Margo told me.</t929>
<t930>—Alright, fine —I replied, because I had forgotten that I was throwing caution to the wind.</t930>
<t931>I passed by the other three stops in Casavilla and we were a couple of kilometers from Pennsylvania Avenue when we saw a police car with its lights on passing us.</t931>
<t932>—It has been very heavy —said Margo—.</t932> <t933>Wow, even for me.</t933> <t934>To put it in your way, my pulse has quickened a bit.</t934>
<t935>—Damn! —I exclaimed—.</t935> <t936>Couldn't you have left it in the car? Or at least on the step?</t936>
<t937>—We unleashed the fucking storm, Q, not scattered showers.</t937>
<t938>—Tell me that the eighth part is not so dreadful.</t938>
<t939>—Don't worry.</t939> <t940>The eighth part is child's play.</t940> <t941>We're going back to Jefferson Park.</t941> <t942>To Lacey's house.</t942> <t943>You know where she lives, right?</t943>
<t944>I knew it, although God knows that Lacey Pemberton would never stoop to invite me in.</t944> <t945>She lived on the other side of Jefferson Park, a couple of kilometers from my house, in a nice apartment block, above a stationery store, on the same block where the dead guy had lived, by the way.</t945> <t946>I had been in that building because some friends of my parents lived on the third floor.</t946> <t947>But before reaching the block itself, there were two locked doors.</t947> <t948>I supposed that not even Margo Roth Spiegelman could make her way through.</t948>
<t949>—Has Lacey been bad or good? —I asked her.</t949>
<t950>—Lacey has been bad, without a doubt —Margo answered me.</t950> <t951>She was looking out the window again, not addressing me, so I could barely hear her—.</t951> <t952>Well, we've been friends since kindergarten.</t952>
<t953>—And?</t953>
<t954>—And she didn't tell me about Jase.</t954> <t955>But that's not all.</t955> <t956>Come to think of it, she's a terrible friend.</t956> <t957>For example, do you think I'm fat?</t957>
<t958>—My dear, no —I replied to her—.</t958> <t959>You are not...</t959> <t960>—And I stopped before saying "thin, but that's the best thing about you. The best thing about you is that you don't look like a boy"—.</t960> <t961>You don't have an extra kilo.</t961>
<t962>He laughed, made a gesture with his hand, and said to me:</t962>
<t963>—What happens is that you love my big butt.</t963>
<t964>I took my eyes off the road for a second, and I shouldn't have done that, because she saw my face, and my face said: "Well, first of all, I wouldn't say she's exactly fat, and secondly, she's spectacular."</t964> <t965>But it was more than that.</t965> <t966>You can't separate the Margo person from the Margo body.</t966> <t967>You can't see one without the other.</t967> <t968>You looked into Margo's eyes and saw both their blue color and her Margoness.</t968> <t969>In the end, you didn't know if Margo Roth Spiegelman was fat or thin, just like you don't know if the Eiffel Tower feels lonely or not.</t969> <t970>Margo's beauty was a kind of closed, intact, and unbreakable vessel of perfection.</t970>
<t971>—Well, she always makes those kinds of comments —Margo continued saying—.</t971> <t972>«I would lend you these shorts, but I don't think they would fit you well», or «You are very brave.</t972> <t973>I love how you get guys to fall in love with your personality».</t973> <t974>All the time undermining me.</t974> <t975>I think she has never said anything that wasn't actually an attempt to undermine me.</t975>
<t976>—I diminish.</t976>
<t977>—Thank you, Mr. Grammar Stickler.</t977>
<t978>—Grammarian —I said to him.</t978>
<t979>—I will kill you! —he exclaimed, smiling.</t979>
<t980>I took a detour through Jefferson Park to avoid passing by our houses, just in case our parents had woken up and discovered that we weren't there.</t980> <t981>We skirted the lake (Jefferson Lake), turned onto Jefferson Court, and headed towards the small, artificial center of Jefferson Park, which seemed eerily deserted and quiet.</t981> <t982>We found Lacey's black SUV parked in front of the sushi restaurant.</t982> <t983>We parked a block away, in the first spot we found that wasn't under a streetlight.</t983>
<t984>—Can you pass me the last fish, please? —Margo asked me.</t984>
<t985>I was glad that we got rid of the fish, because it was already starting to smell.</t985> <t986>And then Margo wrote in her handwriting on the paper that wrapped it: "Your Friendship with ms Sleeps with The fishes".</t986>
<t987>We weaved between the circular beams of light from the streetlights, walking as inconspicuously as two people can when one of them (Margo) is carrying a considerable-sized fish wrapped in paper, and the other (me) is carrying a can of blue spray paint.</t987> <t988>A dog barked, and we both froze, but it quickly quieted down and we soon reached Lacey's car.</t988>
<t989>—Well, this complicates things —said Margo upon seeing that it was closed.</t989>
<t990>He put a hand in his pocket and took out a piece of wire that had once been a hanger.</t990> <t991>It took him less than a minute to unlock the lock.</t991> <t992>I was surprised, of course.</t992>
<t993>As soon as he had opened the driver's door, he extended his arm and opened the one on my side.</t993>
<t994>—Hey, help me lift the seat —he whispered to me.</t994>
<t995>We lifted the seat between the two of us.</t995> <t996>Margo put the fish underneath, counted to three, and in one swift motion, we put the seat back in place.</t996> <t997>I heard the disgusting sound of the catfish's guts bursting.</t997> <t998>I imagined how Lacey's SUV would smell after a day baking in the sun, and I admit a kind of serenity washed over me.</t998>
<t999>—Make an M on the ceiling —Margo asked me.</t999>
<t1000>I didn't think about it for even a second.</t1000> <t1001>I nodded, climbed onto the rear bumper, leaned forward, and quickly sprayed a giant M on the roof.</t1001> <t1002>Normally, I'm against vandalism, but I'm also normally against Lacey Pemberton, and in the end, the latter turned out to be my most deeply held conviction.</t1002> <t1003>I jumped off the car and ran in the darkness —my breathing becoming more rapid and shorter— towards the minivan.</t1003> <t1004>As I put my hand on the steering wheel, I saw that my index finger was blue.</t1004> <t1005>I lifted it so Margo could see it.</t1005> <t1006>She smiled, lifted her blue finger, and we touched, her blue finger gently pushing mine, and my pulse couldn't slow down.</t1006>
<t1007>—Ninth part —he said after a good while—: To the center.</t1007>
<t1008>It was 2:49 in the morning.</t1008> <t1009>Never in my entire life had I been less tired.</t1009>
<t1010>6</t1010>
<t1011>Tourists never go to downtown Orlando because it has nothing, aside from several skyscrapers of banks and insurance companies.</t1011> <t1012>It is one of those downtowns that become absolutely deserted at night and on weekends, except for a couple of half-empty nightclubs for the desperate and the desperately bored.</t1012> <t1013>While following Margo's directions through the maze of one-way streets, we saw several people sleeping on the sidewalks or sitting on benches, but no one was moving.</t1013> <t1014>Margo rolled down the window and I felt a dense gust of air on my face, warmer than usual at night.</t1014> <t1015>I looked at Margo and saw strands of hair flying around her face.</t1015> <t1016>Even though I was looking at her, I felt completely alone amidst those tall and empty buildings, as if I had survived the apocalypse, and the world, that whole surprising and infinite world, opened up before me for exploration.</t1016>
<t1017>—Are you taking me on a sightseeing tour? —I asked him.</t1017>
<t1018>—No —he answered me—.</t1018> <t1019>I'm trying to get to the SunTrust Building.</t1019> <t1020>It's right next to the Asparagus.</t1020>
<t1021>—Ah —I said, because for the first time that night I had useful information—.</t1021> <t1022>It's to the south.</t1022>
<t1023>I left several blocks behind and turned.</t1023> <t1024>Margo pointed very happily, and yes, in front of us was the Asparagus.</t1024>
<t1025>Technically, the Asparagus is neither an asparagus nor a derivative of asparagus.</t1025> <t1026>It is a rare ten-meter sculpture that looks like an asparagus, although I have also heard it compared to:</t1026>
<t1027>1.</t1027> <t1028>A glass bean stalk.</t1028>
<t1029>2.</t1029> <t1030>An abstract representation of a tree.</t1030>
<t1031>3.</t1031> <t1032>A monument to Washington, but green, made of glass, and ugly.</t1032>
<t1033>4.</t1033> <t1034>The cheerful and gigantic green phallus of the giant from the Green Giant brand.</t1034>
<t1035>In any case, what is beyond the slightest doubt is that it does not seem like a Tower of Light, which is what the sculpture is actually called.</t1035> <t1036>I parked in front of a parking meter and looked at Margo.</t1036> <t1037>I caught her staring straight ahead with expressionless eyes, but she wasn't looking at the Asparagus, she was looking beyond it.</t1037> <t1038>For the first time, I thought that maybe something was wrong, not the kind of "my boyfriend is an asshole" wrong, but something truly bad.</t1038> <t1039>And I should have said something.</t1039> <t1040>Of course.</t1040> <t1041>I should have said a million things.</t1041> <t1042>But I just said:</t1042>
<t1043>—Can I ask you why you have brought me to the Asparagus?</t1043>
<t1044>She turned towards me and gave me a smile.</t1044> <t1045>Margo was so beautiful that even her fake smiles were convincing.</t1045>
<t1046>—Let's evaluate our progress.</t1046> <t1047>And the best place to do it is at the top of the SunTrust Building.</t1047>
<t1048>I looked at the sky.</t1048>
<t1049>—No. No.</t1049> <t1050>Impossible.</t1050> <t1051>You said there would be no breaking and entering.</t1051>
<t1052>—It is not a breaking and entering.</t1052> <t1053>Just go in, because there is a door that is not locked.</t1053>
<t1054>—Margo, it's ridiculous.</t1054> <t1055>I assu…</t1055>
<t1056>—I am willing to admit that tonight there has been a break-in.</t1056> <t1057>We have broken into Becca's place and Jase's place.</t1057> <t1058>But in this case, the police won't be able to accuse us of breaking and entering, since we are not going to enter a dwelling.</t1058>
<t1059>—I'm sure the SunTrust Building has a security guard or something —I told him.</t1059>
<t1060>—Yes, it has a security guard —he answered me as he unbuckled his seatbelt—.</t1060> <t1061>Of course.</t1061> <t1062>His name is Gus.</t1062>
<t1063>We crossed the main door.</t1063> <t1064>On the other side of a semicircular counter sat a young man with an incipient goatee, dressed in a security guard uniform.</t1064>
<t1065>—How are you, Margo? —he asked her.</t1065>
<t1066>—Hi, Gus —Margo replied.</t1066>
<t1067>—Who is this kid?</t1067>
<t1068>“WE ARE THE SAME AGE!” I wanted to shout, but I let Margo speak for me.</t1068>
<t1069>—This is my friend Q. Q, this is Gus.</t1069>
<t1070>—What’s up, Q? —Gus asked me.</t1070>
<t1071>"Well, nothing much, we're distributing a few dead fish around the city, breaking some windows, taking photos of naked guys, wandering around private skyscrapers at a quarter past three in the morning... you know, those kinds of things."</t1071>
<t1072>—Not too much —I replied to him.</t1072>
<t1073>—The elevators don't work at night —said Gus—.</t1073> <t1074>I have to turn them off at three.</t1074> <t1075>But you can use the stairs.</t1075>
<t1076>—Great.</t1076> <t1077>See you later, Gus.</t1077>
<t1078>—See you later, Margo.</t1078>
<t1079>—How the hell do you know the security guard at the SunTrust Building? —I asked him as soon as we were safe on the stairs.</t1079>
<t1080>—He was in the last year of high school when we were in the first year —he answered me—.</t1080> <t1081>We have to hurry up, okay?</t1081> <t1082>We're running out of time.</t1082>
<t1083>Margo started climbing the steps two at a time, at full speed and with one hand on the railing, and I tried to keep up with her, but I couldn't.</t1083> <t1084>Margo didn't play sports, but she liked to run.</t1084> <t1085>From time to time, I saw her in Jefferson Park running alone with her headphones on.</t1085> <t1086>But I didn't like running.</t1086> <t1087>In fact, I didn't like making the slightest physical effort.</t1087> <t1088>But I tried to keep a steady pace, wipe the sweat from my forehead, and ignore the burning in my legs.</t1088> <t1089>When I reached the twenty-fifth floor, Margo was waiting for me on the landing.</t1089>
<t1090>—Take a look —he told me.</t1090>
<t1091>He opened the stairway door and we entered a huge room with an oak table the size of two cars and some large windows that went from the floor to the ceiling.</t1091>
<t1092>—The conference room —he explained to me—.</t1092> <t1093>It has the best views in the entire building.</t1093> <t1094>—I followed her as she walked through the room—.</t1094> <t1095>Well, there's Jefferson Park —she said, pointing—.</t1095> <t1096>Do you see our houses?</t1096> <t1097>The lights are still off, so that's perfect.</t1097> <t1098>—She moved forward a couple of windows—.</t1098> <t1099>Jase's house.</t1099> <t1100>The lights are off and no police cars.</t1100> <t1101>Excellent, although that could mean he's already home.</t1101> <t1102>Bad luck.</t1102>
<t1103>Becca's house was too far away, even from that height.</t1103>
<t1104>She stayed silent for a moment and then went to the window and pressed her forehead against the glass.</t1104> <t1105>I stayed behind, but she grabbed me by the shirt and pulled me.</t1105> <t1106>I didn't want the glass to have to bear the weight of both of us, but she kept pulling me, I felt her fist at my side, so in the end, I also pressed my head against the glass as gently as possible and took a look.</t1106>
<t1107>From above, Orlando seemed quite illuminated.</t1107> <t1108>I could see the blinking traffic lights at the intersections and the streetlights lined up throughout the city, like a perfect grid, until the center ended and the winding streets and alleys of Orlando's endless outskirts began.</t1108>
<t1109>—How beautiful —I said.</t1109>
<t1110>—Really? —Margo mocked—.</t1110> <t1111>Are you serious?</t1111>
<t1112>—Well, I don't know, maybe not —I replied, although it seemed nice to me.</t1112>
<t1113>When I saw Orlando from a plane, it looked like a Lego piece submerged in a green sea.</t1113> <t1114>There, at night, it seemed like a real city, but a real city that I was seeing for the first time.</t1114> <t1115>I walked through the conference room, and then the other offices on the floor.</t1115> <t1116>The whole city could be seen.</t1116> <t1117>There was the institute.</t1117> <t1118>There, Jefferson Park.</t1118> <t1119>There, in the distance, Disney World.</t1119> <t1120>There, the Wet’n Wild water park.</t1120> <t1121>There, the 7-Eleven where Margo had painted her nails and I struggled to breathe.</t1121> <t1122>There was my entire world, and I could see it just by walking through a building.</t1122>
<t1123>—It's more impressive —I said out loud—.</t1123> <t1124>From a distance, I mean.</t1124> <t1125>You don't see the wear and tear of things, you know?</t1125> <t1126>You don't see the rust, the weeds, and the peeling paint.</t1126> <t1127>You see places as someone once imagined them.</t1127>
<t1128>—Everything is uglier up close —explained Margo.</t1128>
<t1129>—Not you —I replied without thinking twice.</t1129>
<t1130>She turned, without lifting her forehead from the glass, and smiled at me.</t1130>
<t1131>—I give you your reward: you are cute when you trust yourself.</t1131> <t1132>And less cute when you don't.</t1132>
<t1133>Before he had time to say anything, he turned his eyes to the city and continued speaking.</t1133>
<t1134>—I'll tell you what I don't like: from here you can't see the rust, the peeling paint, and all that, but you see what it really is.</t1134> <t1135>You see how fake everything is.</t1135> <t1136>It's not even as tough as plastic.</t1136> <t1137>It's a paper town.</t1137> <t1138>Look at it, Q, look at all those alleys, those streets that turn back on themselves, all the houses they built just to fall apart.</t1138> <t1139>All those paper people living in their paper houses and burning the future to keep warm.</t1139> <t1140>All the paper kids drinking beer that some idiot bought for them at the paper store.</t1140> <t1141>Everyone going crazy with the obsession of owning things.</t1141> <t1142>All the things weak and fragile like paper.</t1142> <t1143>And all the people too.</t1143> <t1144>I've lived here for eighteen years and not once in my life have I met someone who cares about what really matters.</t1144>
<t1145>—I will try not to take it personally —I said to him.</t1145>
<t1146>We both stayed watching the dark distance, the dead-end streets, and the thousand-square-meter plots.</t1146> <t1147>But Margo had her shoulder pressed against my arm, the backs of our hands touched, and although I wasn't looking at her, pressing against the glass was almost like pressing against her.</t1147>
<t1148>—I'm sorry —she apologized—.</t1148> <t1149>Maybe things would have been different for me if I had gone out with you instead of... ugh.</t1149> <t1150>Shit.</t1150> <t1151>I hate myself for caring about my supposed friends.</t1151> <t1152>Look, just so you know, it's not that Jason affects me that much.</t1152> <t1153>Or Becca.</t1153> <t1154>Or even Lacey, although I really liked her.</t1154> <t1155>But it was the last thread.</t1155> <t1156>It was a weak thread, of course, but it was the only one I had left, and every paper girl needs at least one thread, right?</t1156>
<t1157>And what I replied was the following:</t1157>
<t1158>—You can sit and eat with us tomorrow.</t1158>
<t1159>—Very kind —he said to me in an increasingly subdued tone.</t1159>
<t1160>He turned towards me and nodded softly.</t1160> <t1161>I smiled.</t1161> <t1162>She smiled.</t1162> <t1163>I believed her smile.</t1163> <t1164>We headed to the stairs and ran down.</t1164> <t1165>At the end of each flight, I would jump from the last step and click my heels to make her laugh, and Margo laughed.</t1165> <t1166>I thought I was cheering her up.</t1166> <t1167>I thought that maybe if I managed to trust myself, there could be something between us.</t1167>
<t1168>I was wrong.</t1168>
<t1169>7</t1169>
<t1170>Sitting in the car, with the keys in the ignition, although without having started the engine, Margo asked me:</t1170>
<t1171>—By the way, what time do your parents get up?</t1171>
<t1172>—I don't know, around a quarter past six, maybe.</t1172> <t1173>—It was 3:51—.</t1173> <t1174>Well, so we have two hours left and we've already finished nine parts.</t1174>
<t1175>—I know, but I have left the hardest ones for last.</t1175> <t1176>Anyway, we will finish them all.</t1176> <t1177>Tenth part: it's your turn to choose a victim.</t1177>
<t1178>—What?</t1178>
<t1179>—I have already decided the punishment.</t1179> <t1180>Now it's your turn to choose upon whom our terrible wrath will fall.</t1180>
<t1181>—On whom our terrible wrath will fall —I corrected her, and she shook her head with an annoyed expression—.</t1181> <t1182>The truth is, there is no one upon whom I want to unleash my wrath.</t1182>
<t1183>And it was true.</t1183> <t1184>I had always believed that you had to be important to have enemies.</t1184> <t1185>For example: historically, Germany has had more enemies than Luxembourg.</t1185> <t1186>Margo Roth Spiegelman was Germany.</t1186> <t1187>And Great Britain.</t1187> <t1188>And the United States.</t1188> <t1189>And Tsarist Russia.</t1189> <t1190>I am Luxembourg.</t1190> <t1191>I sit around, watch the sheep, and sing Tyrolean songs.</t1191>
<t1192>—What do you tell me about Chuck? —he asked me.</t1192>
<t1193>—Hmm —I replied.</t1193>
<t1194>Chuck Parson had been a nightmare for years before they put a leash on him.</t1194> <t1195>Besides the disaster with the cafeteria conveyor belt, he once dragged me out of school and, while waiting for the bus, twisted my arm and kept repeating: "Say you're a faggot."</t1195> <t1196>It was his insult for everything because, with a twelve-word vocabulary, one couldn't expect a wide variety of insults.</t1196> <t1197>And although it was ridiculously childish, in the end, I had to say I was a faggot, and it pissed me off because: 1) I believe no one should use that word, least of all me; 2) It turns out I'm not gay, and besides, 3)</t1197> <t1198>That Chuck Parson getting you to call yourself a faggot was the ultimate humiliation, even though there's nothing shameful about being gay, which I tried to explain to him while he twisted my arm and lifted it higher towards my shoulder blade, but he kept saying: "If you're so proud of being a faggot, why don't you admit you're a faggot, you're a faggot?"</t1198>
<t1199>It is evident that Chuck Parson was not Aristotle when it came to logic.</t1199> <t1200>But he was one meter ninety and weighed one hundred and twenty kilos, which is not insignificant.</t1200>
<t1201>—Chuck would be justified —I admitted.</t1201>
<t1202>I started the car and headed for the highway.</t1202> <t1203>I didn't know where we were going, but I was very sure that we were not going to stay downtown.</t1203>
<t1204>—Do you remember the Crown Dance School thing? —Margo asked me—.</t1204> <t1205>I was thinking about it tonight.</t1205>
<t1206>—Ugh, yes.</t1206>
<t1207>—I'm sorry, by the way.</t1207> <t1208>I don't know why I allowed it.</t1208>
<t1209>—Well, it's no big deal —I said to him, but remembering the darn Crown Dance School got on my nerves, so I added—: Yes.</t1209> <t1210>Chuck Parson.</t1210> <t1211>Do you know where he lives?</t1211>
<t1212>—I knew I could bring out your vengeful side.</t1212> <t1213>It's in College Park.</t1213> <t1214>Get off at Princeton.</t1214>
<t1215>I turned towards the highway entrance and stepped on the accelerator.</t1215>
<t1216>—Don't drive so fast! —exclaimed Margo—.</t1216> <t1217>Don't go and break the Chrysler.</t1217>
<t1218>In sixth grade, a group of kids, including Margo, Chuck, and me, were forced by our parents to take dance classes at the School of Humiliation, Degradation, and Dance Crown.</t1218> <t1219>The boys had to stand on one side, the girls on the other, and when the teacher told us to, the boys would approach the girls and say, "May I have this dance?" and the girls would respond, "I grant you this dance."</t1219> <t1220>That's how it worked.</t1220> <t1221>The girls couldn't say no.</t1221> <t1222>But one day, while dancing the foxtrot, Chuck Parson convinced each and every girl to say no to me.</t1222> <t1223>To no one else.</t1223> <t1224>Just to me.</t1224> <t1225>I approached Mary Beth Shortz and said, "May I have this dance?" and she answered no.</t1225> <t1226>Then I asked another girl, and another, and Margo, who also said no, and then another, and in the end, I started to cry.</t1226>
<t1227>The only thing worse than being rejected by the dance school is crying because you were rejected by the dance school, and the only thing worse than that is going to the dance teacher and telling her while crying: "The girls have said no to me, and they’re not supposed to."</t1227> <t1228>So, of course, I went crying to the teacher, and I spent almost all the following years trying to get over that embarrassing episode.</t1228> <t1229>In short, Chuck Parson prevented me from dancing the foxtrot, which doesn’t seem like such a horrible punishment for a sixth grader.</t1229> <t1230>And the truth is, I was no longer angry about that, nor about anything he had done to me over the years.</t1230> <t1231>But it was clear that I wasn’t going to regret if he suffered either.</t1231>
<t1232>—Wait.</t1232> <t1233>They won't find out it was me, right?</t1233>
<t1234>—No.</t1234> <t1235>Why?</t1235>
<t1236>—I don't want him to think that I care enough to screw him over.</t1236>
<t1237>I rested a hand on the glove compartment located between the seats, and Margo patted me.</t1237>
<t1238>—Don't worry —he told me—.</t1238> <t1239>He will never know what shaved him.</t1239>
<t1240>—I think you made up a word, because I don't know what it means.</t1240>
<t1241>—I know a word that you don't know —Margo sang—.</t1241> <t1242>I AM THE NEW QUEEN OF WORDS!</t1242> <t1243>I HAVE REPLACED YOU!</t1243>
<t1244>—Spell "Suplantado" —I said to him.</t1244>
<t1245>—No —he answered me, laughing—.</t1245> <t1246>I'm not going to give up my crown for an "Imposter."</t1246> <t1247>You'll have to come up with something better.</t1247>
<t1248>—Perfect —I said, smiling.</t1248>
<t1249>We passed through College Park, a neighborhood considered part of the historic district of Orlando because most of the houses were built more than thirty years ago.</t1249> <t1250>Margo didn't remember Chuck's exact address, nor what his house looked like, nor even exactly which street it was on ("Ninety-five percent chance it's on Vassar").</t1250> <t1251>In the end, when the Chrysler had patrolled three blocks of Vassar Street, Margo pointed to the left and said:</t1251>
<t1252>—That one.</t1252>
<t1253>—Are you sure? —I asked her.</t1253>
<t1254>—Ninety-seven point two percent chance.</t1254> <t1255>Wow, I'm almost sure that his room is that one —she told me, pointing—.</t1255> <t1256>Once he had a party, and when the cops came, I slipped out through that window.</t1256> <t1257>I'm almost sure it's the same one.</t1257>
<t1258>—We could get into trouble.</t1258>
<t1259>—If the window is open, we won't cause any damage.</t1259> <t1260>We'll just go in.</t1260> <t1261>We've already gotten into the SunTrust and it wasn't that bad, right?</t1261>
<t1262>I laughed.</t1262>
<t1263>—You are turning me into an asshole.</t1263>
<t1264>—That's what it's about.</t1264> <t1265>Come on, the tools.</t1265> <t1266>Grab the Veet, the spray paint, and the Vaseline.</t1266>
<t1267>—Agreed.</t1267>
<t1268>I caught them.</t1268>
<t1269>—Now don’t get hysterical on me, Q.</t1269> <t1270>The good news is that Chuck sleeps like a hibernating bear…</t1270> <t1271>I know because last year I had literature class with him and he didn’t even wake up when Miss Johnston hit him with Jane Eyre.</t1271> <t1272>So we’ll climb up to his room’s window, open it, take off our shoes, enter quietly, and I’ll take care of messing with Chuck.</t1272> <t1273>Then the two of us will spread out through the house and cover all the doorknobs with Vaseline so that if someone gets up, it’ll be really hard for them to get out of the house in time to catch us.</t1273> <t1274>Then we’ll mess with Chuck a bit more, paint the house a little, and leave.</t1274> <t1275>And not a word.</t1275>
<t1276>I put my hand to my jugular, but I smiled.</t1276>
<t1277>We were walking away from the car when Margo took my hand, intertwined her fingers with mine, and squeezed.</t1277> <t1278>I squeezed back and looked at her.</t1278> <t1279>She nodded solemnly, I squeezed again, and she let go of my hand.</t1279> <t1280>We ran to the window.</t1280> <t1281>I slowly pushed the wooden frame up.</t1281> <t1282>It creaked a little, but it opened on the first try.</t1282> <t1283>I took a look inside.</t1283> <t1284>Although it was dark, I saw someone on a bed.</t1284>
<t1285>Since the window was a bit high for Margo, I cupped my hands, she put a foot on them, and I boosted her up.</t1285> <t1286>Her silent entry into the house would have been the envy of a ninja.</t1286> <t1287>I prepared to climb up, stuck my head and shoulders through the window, and intended, through a complicated contortion, to enter the house caterpillar-style.</t1287> <t1288>It could have worked perfectly if I hadn't crushed my balls against the ledge, and it hurt so much that I let out a groan, which was no small mistake.</t1288>
<t1289>The light on the bedside table turned on.</t1289> <t1290>And it turned out that the one in the bed was an old man, certainly not Chuck Parson.</t1290> <t1291>He opened his eyes wide, terrified.</t1291> <t1292>He didn't say a word.</t1292>
<t1293>—Hmm —murmured Margo.</t1293>
<t1294>I thought about running to the car, but I stayed for Margo, with half of my body inside the house, parallel to the ground.</t1294>
<t1295>—Hmm, I think we've come to the wrong house —said Margo.</t1295>
<t1296>He turned, looked at me insistently, and only then did I realize that I was blocking his way out.</t1296> <t1297>So I jumped out of the window, grabbed my shoes, and started running.</t1297>
<t1298>We headed to the other end of College Park to regroup.</t1298>
<t1299>—I think this time it's both of our faults —said Margo.</t1299>
<t1300>—Well, the one who got the wrong house is you —I replied.</t1300>
<t1301>—Yes, but the one who made noise was you.</t1301>
<t1302>We stayed silent for a minute.</t1302> <t1303>I was driving in circles.</t1303>
<t1304>—Surely we can get his address on the internet —I said finally—.</t1304> <t1305>Radar is registered on the school's website.</t1305>
<t1306>—Great —added Margo.</t1306>
<t1307>So I called Radar, but it went straight to voicemail.</t1307> <t1308>I considered calling his house, but his parents were friends with mine, so that wouldn't work.</t1308> <t1309>In the end, I thought of calling Ben.</t1309> <t1310>He wasn't Radar, but he knew all his passwords.</t1310> <t1311>I called him.</t1311> <t1312>It went to voicemail after ringing several times.</t1312> <t1313>I called again.</t1313> <t1314>Voicemail.</t1314> <t1315>I called again.</t1315> <t1316>Voicemail.</t1316>
<t1317>—It's clear that he's not answering —observed Margo.</t1317>
<t1318>—Well, he'll answer —I said, dialing again.</t1318>
<t1319>And after a couple more calls, he answered.</t1319>
<t1320>—You better have called me to tell me that you have eleven naked chicks at your house asking for the special sensitivity that only the great Papa Ben can offer them.</t1320>
<t1321>—I need you to log into the institute's website with Radar's password and find me an address.</t1321> <t1322>Chuck Parson.</t1322>
<t1323>—No.</t1323>
<t1324>—Please —I said to him.</t1324>
<t1325>—No.</t1325>
<t1326>—You will be glad you did it, Ben.</t1326> <t1327>I promise you.</t1327>
<t1328>—Yes, yes.</t1328> <t1329>It's done.</t1329> <t1330>I was coming in while I was telling you no...</t1330> <t1331>I can't help but assist you.</t1331> <t1332>Amherst, 422.</t1332> <t1333>Hey, why do you need Chuck Parson's address at four twelve in the morning?</t1333>
<t1334>—Go back to sleep, Benners.</t1334>
<t1335>—I think it was just a dream —Ben replied to me.</t1335>
<t1336>And hung up.</t1336>
<t1337>Amherst was just a couple of blocks away.</t1337> <t1338>We parked in front of 418, grabbed the tools, and ran across Chuck's lawn.</t1338> <t1339>The dew covering the grass soaked my calves.</t1339>
<t1340>I climbed silently to his window, which luckily was lower than that of the old man we had run into by chance, and pulled Margo in.</t1340> <t1341>Chuck Parson was sleeping on his back.</t1341> <t1342>Margo tiptoed towards him, and I stayed behind, my heart pounding.</t1342> <t1343>If he woke up, he would kill us both.</t1343> <t1344>Margo took out the Veet bottle, pressed it, put a ball that looked like shaving cream in her palm, and very gently and carefully spread it over Chuck's right eyebrow, who didn't even blink.</t1344>
<t1345>Then Margo opened the Vaseline.</t1345> <t1346>The lid made a pop that seemed deafening, but Chuck didn't show any signs of waking up either.</t1346> <t1347>She put a huge glob in my hand and we each went to one side of the house.</t1347> <t1348>I first went to the foyer and smeared Vaseline on the front door knob, then to the open door of a bedroom, where I applied Vaseline on the inner knob and then, very slowly, closed the door, which barely creaked.</t1348>
<t1349>Finally, I returned to Chuck's room —Margo was already there—, and together we closed the door and smeared the doorknob with Vaseline.</t1349> <t1350>We smeared the entire window of the room with the remaining Vaseline in the hope that, after closing it, it would be difficult to open.</t1350>
<t1351>Margo glanced at her watch and raised two fingers.</t1351> <t1352>We waited.</t1352> <t1353>And for two minutes we just stared at each other.</t1353> <t1354>I observed the blue of her eyes.</t1354> <t1355>It was beautiful.</t1355> <t1356>In the dark and in silence, without the possibility of me saying something and messing it up, and she returned my gaze, as if there was something in me worth seeing.</t1356>
<t1357>Margo nodded and I approached Chuck.</t1357> <t1358>I wrapped my hand with the t-shirt, as she had told me, leaned forward and —as gently as I could— placed a finger on Chuck Parson's right eyebrow and quickly removed the depilatory cream, which took with it every last hair.</t1358> <t1359>I was still next to Chuck, with his right eyebrow on my t-shirt, when he opened his eyes.</t1359> <t1360>Margo grabbed the duvet like an arrow, threw it in his face, and when I looked up, the little ninja had already jumped out the window.</t1360> <t1361>I followed her as quickly as I could while Chuck screamed: MOM! DAD!</t1361> <t1362>THIEVES!</t1362> <t1363>THIEVES!</t1363>
<t1364>I wanted to say: "The only thing we've stolen from you is your eyebrow," but I shut my mouth and jumped out the window.</t1364> <t1365>I almost landed on top of Margo, who was painting an M on the plastic siding of Chuck's house.</t1365> <t1366>Then we grabbed the shoes and hurried back to the car.</t1366> <t1367>I turned to look at the house and saw that the lights were on, but no one had come out yet, which brilliantly demonstrated how well I had greased the doorknob with Vaseline.</t1367> <t1368>When Mr. Parson (or maybe Mrs. Parson, to be honest I didn't see) drew the dining room curtains and took a look, we were already backing away towards Princeton Street and the highway.</t1368>
<t1369>—Yes! —I shouted—.</t1369> <t1370>Damn, it was awesome.</t1370>
<t1371>—Have you seen him?</t1371> <t1372>Have you seen his face without an eyebrow?</t1372> <t1373>He looks like a question mark.</t1373> <t1374>Like: "Seriously? Are you telling me I only have one eyebrow? Nonsense."</t1374> <t1375>And I loved having to decide whether to pluck his left eyebrow or his right one.</t1375> <t1376>Yes, I loved it.</t1376> <t1377>And how he screamed calling for his mom, the little crybaby.</t1377>
<t1378>—Wait, why do you hate him?</t1378>
<t1379>—I didn't say I hate him.</t1379> <t1380>I said he's a pathetic crybaby.</t1380>
<t1381>—But you have always been her friend —I told her.</t1381>
<t1382>Or at least I thought I was her friend.</t1382>
<t1383>—Yes, well, she was friends with a lot of people —he replied to me.</t1383>
<t1384>Margo stretched out in the car, rested her head on my bony shoulder, and her hair slipped down my neck.</t1384>
<t1385>—I am tired —she added.</t1385>
<t1386>—Caffeine —I told him.</t1386>
<t1387>He reached back and grabbed two cans of Mountain Dew.</t1387> <t1388>I drank mine in two long gulps.</t1388>
<t1389>—Well, let's go to SeaWorld —he told me—.</t1389> <t1390>Eleventh part.</t1390>
<t1391>—How? Are we going to free Willy or something like that?</t1391>
<t1392>—No —he replied to me—.</t1392> <t1393>We're simply going to SeaWorld, that's all.</t1393> <t1394>It's the only theme park I haven't broken into yet.</t1394>
<t1395>—We can't raid SeaWorld —I told him.</t1395>
<t1396>I pulled into the empty parking lot of a furniture store and turned off the car.</t1396>
<t1397>—The moment of truth has arrived —he told me, leaning over to restart the car.</t1397>
<t1398>I pushed his hands away.</t1398>
<t1399>—We cannot raid SeaWorld —I repeated.</t1399>
<t1400>—Here we go again with the raid.</t1400>
<t1401>He fell silent for a moment and opened another can of Mountain Dew.</t1401> <t1402>The can cast light on his face and for a second I saw him smiling at what he was about to say.</t1402>
<t1403>—We are not going to break in.</t1403> <t1404>Don't consider it a break-in.</t1404> <t1405>Consider it a free visit to SeaWorld in the middle of the night.</t1405>
<t1406>8</t1406>
<t1407>—Look, to begin with, they will catch us —I told him.</t1407>
<t1408>I had not started the car.</t1408> <t1409>I was counting the reasons why I was not going to start it and wondering if Margo could see me in the dark.</t1409>
<t1410>—Of course they'll catch us.</t1410> <t1411>So what?</t1411>
<t1412>—It's illegal.</t1412>
<t1413>—Q, what problem can SeaWorld cause you in comparative terms?</t1413> <t1414>I mean, damn, after everything I've done for you tonight, can't you do just one thing for me?</t1414> <t1415>Can't you shut up, calm down, and stop freaking out so much over every little adventure?</t1415> <t1416>—And in a low voice he added—: Damn, grow a pair.</t1416>
<t1417>Then I went crazy.</t1417> <t1418>I went under the seatbelt so I could get closer to her.</t1418>
<t1419>—After everything you've done for me? —I almost shouted.</t1419> <t1420>Didn't you want me to trust myself?</t1420> <t1421>Well, there you had it—.</t1421> <t1422>Did you call my friend's father, who was screwing my boyfriend, so no one would find out that it was me who called?</t1422> <t1423>Have you acted as my chauffeur not because you're important to me, but because I needed a car and you were available?</t1423> <t1424>Is that the crap you've done for me tonight?</t1424>
<t1425>He didn't look at me.</t1425> <t1426>He looked straight ahead, towards the plastic covering of the furniture store.</t1426>
<t1427>—Do you think I needed you?</t1427> <t1428>Don’t you think I could have given Myrna Mountweazel a sedative to make her sleep and stolen the box from under my parents' bed?</t1428> <t1429>Or sneaked into your room while you were sleeping and taken your car keys?</t1429> <t1430>I didn’t need you, idiot.</t1430> <t1431>I chose you.</t1431> <t1432>And then you chose me.</t1432> <t1433>—He looked at me—.</t1433> <t1434>And this is like a promise.</t1434> <t1435>At least for tonight.</t1435> <t1436>In sickness and in health.</t1436> <t1437>For better or for worse.</t1437> <t1438>For richer or for poorer.</t1438> <t1439>Until dawn do us part.</t1439>
<t1440>I started the car and left the parking lot, but, putting aside his spiel about teamwork, I felt that he was pressuring me and wanted to have the last word.</t1440>
<t1441>—Very well, but when SeaWorld or whoever writes to Duke University saying that the unscrupulous Quentin Jacobsen broke into their building at four-thirty in the morning with a wild-eyed girl, Duke University will be furious.</t1441> <t1442>And my parents too.</t1442>
<t1443>—Q, you will go to Duke.</t1443> <t1444>You will be a very successful lawyer, or whatever, you will get married, have children, live your mediocre life and die, and in your last moments, when you are drowning in your own bile in the nursing home, you will say to yourself: "Well, I wasted my whole fucking life, but at least in the last year of high school I got into SeaWorld with Margo Roth Spiegelman."</t1444> <t1445>At least, I carpe'd a diem."</t1445>
<t1446>—Night —I corrected her.</t1446>
<t1447>—Alright, you're the king of grammar again.</t1447> <t1448>You've just reclaimed the throne.</t1448> <t1449>Now take me to SeaWorld.</t1449>
<t1450>As we moved silently along the I-4, I found myself thinking about the day the guy in the gray suit turned up dead.</t1450> <t1451>“Maybe that's why he chose me,” I thought.</t1451> <t1452>And at that moment, I finally remembered what he had told me about the dead man and the threads.</t1452> <t1453>And about her and the threads.</t1453>
<t1454>—Margo —I said, breaking the silence.</t1454>
<t1455>—Q —he answered me.</t1455>
<t1456>—You said...</t1456> <t1457>When that guy died, you said that maybe his strings had broken inside, and a while ago you said the same about yourself, that the last string had broken.</t1457>
<t1458>He half-laughed.</t1458>
<t1459>—You worry too much.</t1459> <t1460>I don't want some kids to find me covered in flies on a Saturday morning in Jefferson Park.</t1460> <t1461>—She paused for a moment before finishing the sentence—: I'm too vain to end up like that.</t1461>
<t1462>I laughed with relief and exited the highway.</t1462> <t1463>We turned onto International Drive, the tourism capital of the world.</t1463> <t1464>On International Drive, there were a thousand stores selling exactly the same thing: crap.</t1464> <t1465>Crap in the form of shells, keychains, glass turtles, refrigerator magnets shaped like Florida, plastic pink flamingos, and things like that.</t1465> <t1466>In fact, on International Drive, there were several stores selling real, literal armadillo crap, for $4.95 a bag.</t1466>
<t1467>But at 4:50 in the morning, the tourists were sleeping.</t1467> <t1468>Drive, like everything else, was completely dead as we left behind shops, parking lots, more shops, and more parking lots.</t1468>
<t1469>—SeaWorld is right behind the highway —said Margo.</t1469> <t1470>She was in the back of the car again, rummaging through a backpack or something like that—.</t1470> <t1471>I have a bunch of satellite maps and I drew our plan of attack, but I can't find them anywhere.</t1471> <t1472>Anyway, turn right after the highway, and on the left, you'll see a souvenir shop.</t1472>
<t1473>—To the left, there are about seventeen thousand souvenir shops.</t1473>
<t1474>—Yes, but right after the highway there will be only one.</t1474>
<t1475>And of course, there was only one, so I pulled into the empty parking lot and parked the car under a streetlight, because on International Drive, cars are always getting stolen.</t1475> <t1476>And although only a masochistic car thief would think of snatching the Chrysler, I didn't feel like explaining to my mother how and why her car had disappeared in the middle of the night on a school day.</t1476>
<t1477>We stayed outside, leaning against the back of the minivan.</t1477> <t1478>The air was so warm and dense that my clothes stuck to my skin.</t1478> <t1479>I was scared again, as if people I couldn't see were watching me.</t1479> <t1480>The night had been very long and I had been worried for so many hours that my stomach hurt.</t1480> <t1481>Margo had found the maps and was tracing our route with her blue finger under the streetlight.</t1481>
<t1482>—I think there's a fence here —he told me, pointing to a wooded area we had encountered just after crossing the highway—.</t1482> <t1483>I read it on the internet.</t1483> <t1484>They put it up a few years ago because a drunk person entered the park in the middle of the night and decided to take a swim with the orca Shamu, who didn't take long to kill him.</t1484>
<t1485>—Seriously?</t1485>
<t1486>—Yes, so if that guy could get in drunk, surely we, who haven't drunk, can also get in.</t1486> <t1487>Come on, we're ninjas.</t1487>
<t1488>—Well, maybe you are a ninja —I told her.</t1488>
<t1489>—We are both ninjas, only you are a clumsy and noisy ninja —said Margo.</t1489>
<t1490>She tucked her hair behind her ears, put on the hood, and tied it with the cord.</t1490> <t1491>The streetlamp illuminated the sharp features of her pale face.</t1491> <t1492>Maybe we were both ninjas, but only she looked like one.</t1492>
<t1493>—Alright —he told me—, memorize the map.</t1493>
<t1494>The most terrifying part of the nearly one-kilometer route that Margo had mapped out was, by far, the moat.</t1494> <t1495>SeaWorld was triangular in shape.</t1495> <t1496>One side was protected by a road on which Margo assumed night watchmen patrolled permanently.</t1496> <t1497>The second side was protected by a lake with a perimeter of almost two kilometers, and on the third side, there was a drainage ditch.</t1497> <t1498>According to the map, it seemed to be as wide as a two-lane road.</t1498> <t1499>And in Florida, drainage ditches next to lakes usually have alligators.</t1499>
<t1500>Margo grabbed me by the shoulders and turned me towards her.</t1500>
<t1501>—Surely they will catch us, so when they do, let me do the talking.</t1501> <t1502>You just focus on looking good, half innocent, half confident, and everything will be fine.</t1502>
<t1503>I locked the car, tried to smooth down my disheveled hair with my hand, and murmured:</t1503>
<t1504>—I am a ninja.</t1504>
<t1505>He didn't intend for Margo to hear him, but suddenly he blurted out:</t1505>
<t1506>—Of course, damn it! Now, let's go.</t1506>
<t1507>We ran along International Drive and then made our way through tall bushes and oaks.</t1507> <t1508>I started to worry about poison ivy, but ninjas don't worry about those things, so I took the lead, with my arms outstretched, and pushed aside the brambles and weeds as we advanced toward the moat.</t1508> <t1509>Eventually, the wooded area ended and we reached an open field.</t1509> <t1510>I could see the highway to our right and the moat directly ahead.</t1510> <t1511>We could have been seen from the road if any cars had passed by, but none did.</t1511> <t1512>We ran through the underbrush and made a sharp turn toward the highway.</t1512>
<t1513>—Now! Now! —exclaimed Margo.</t1513>
<t1514>And I ran across the six lanes of the highway.</t1514> <t1515>Although it was empty, crossing such a large road seemed thrilling and inappropriate to me.</t1515>
<t1516>After crossing, we knelt on the grass beside the highway.</t1516> <t1517>Margo pointed to the row of trees situated between the endless SeaWorld parking lot and the black water of the moat.</t1517> <t1518>We ran for a minute along that row of trees, and then Margo pulled my shirt from behind and whispered to me:</t1518>
<t1519>—Now the pit.</t1519>
<t1520>—Ladies first —I said to him.</t1520>
<t1521>—No, really, make yourself at home —he replied to me.</t1521>
<t1522>And I didn't think about the alligators or the disgusting layer of brackish algae.</t1522> <t1523>I took a running start and jumped as far as I could.</t1523> <t1524>I landed in water up to my waist and strode forward with large steps.</t1524> <t1525>The water smelled rotten and was full of mud, but at least I hadn't gotten wet from the waist up.</t1525> <t1526>Or at least until Margo jumped and splashed me.</t1526> <t1527>I turned and splashed her back.</t1527> <t1528>She pretended she was going to vomit.</t1528>
<t1529>—Ninjas don't splash each other —complained Margo.</t1529>
<t1530>—The true ninja doesn't splash when jumping —I replied.</t1530>
<t1531>—Okay, touché.</t1531>
<t1532>I watched Margo coming out of the pit, delighted that there were no alligators.</t1532> <t1533>My pulse was acceptable, though accelerated.</t1533> <t1534>The water clung to Margo's body, making the black t-shirt she wore under her unbuttoned sweatshirt stick to her.</t1534> <t1535>In short, almost everything was perfect when I saw out of the corner of my eye something slithering in the water near Margo.</t1535> <t1536>Margo started to get out of the water, and I saw her Achilles tendon tighten.</t1536> <t1537>Before I could open my mouth, the snake lunged at her and bit her left ankle, right where her jeans ended.</t1537>
<t1538>—Shit! —exclaimed Margo.</t1538> <t1539>She looked down and repeated—: Shit!</t1539>
<t1540>The snake was still clinging to her ankle.</t1540> <t1541>I dived in, grabbed the snake by the tail, tore it off Margo's leg, and threw it into the pit.</t1541>
<t1542>—Oh, damn —he said—.</t1542> <t1543>What was it? Was it a cotton mouth?</t1543>
<t1544>—I don't know.</t1544> <t1545>Lie down, lie down —I ordered him.</t1545>
<t1546>I grabbed his leg and rolled up his jeans.</t1546> <t1547>The fangs had left two small holes from which a drop of blood was oozing.</t1547> <t1548>I bent down, put my mouth on the wound, and sucked with all my strength to try to extract the venom.</t1548> <t1549>I spat, and was about to suck again when Margo said:</t1549>
<t1550>—Wait, I see her.</t1550>
<t1551>I jumped up, terrified.</t1551>
<t1552>—No, no —he kept saying—.</t1552> <t1553>Damn, it's just a snake.</t1553>
<t1554>He pointed to the pit.</t1554> <t1555>I followed his finger and saw the small snake slithering across the surface, just below the beam of a spotlight.</t1555> <t1556>From a distance, it didn't look much more fearsome than a lizard.</t1556>
<t1557>—Thank God —I said, sitting down next to him and catching my breath.</t1557>
<t1558>After taking a look at the bite and seeing that it was no longer bleeding, he asked me:</t1558>
<t1559>—How was the steak you had with my leg?</t1559>
<t1560>—Very well —I replied, and it was true.</t1560>
<t1561>He leaned in a little towards me and I felt his arm against my ribs.</t1561>
<t1562>—I shaved this morning precisely because of that.</t1562> <t1563>I thought: "Well, you never know when someone will grab your leg to suck out snake venom."</t1563>
<t1564>In front of us, there was a wire mesh fence barely two meters high.</t1564>
<t1565>—Seriously? First snakes and now this fence? —said Margo—.</t1565> <t1566>This security is insulting for a ninja.</t1566>
<t1567>He climbed over, went to the other side, and descended as if it were a staircase.</t1567> <t1568>I tried not to fall.</t1568>
<t1569>We passed through a small grove next to some huge opaque tanks where they surely kept animals, we ended up on a paved road and I saw the great amphitheater where Shamu splashed me as a child.</t1569> <t1570>The small speakers along the path played ambient music, perhaps to calm the animals.</t1570>
<t1571>—Margo —I said—, we are at SeaWorld.</t1571>
<t1572>—Indeed —he replied to me.</t1572>
<t1573>She started running and I followed her.</t1573> <t1574>We ended up at the seal aquarium, which seemed empty.</t1574>
<t1575>—Margo, we are at SeaWorld —I repeated.</t1575>
<t1576>—Enjoy it —he replied to me without barely moving his mouth—.</t1576> <t1577>Because a guard is coming this way.</t1577>
<t1578>I ran towards a bushy area that reached my waist, but seeing that Margo wasn't running, I stopped.</t1578> <t1579>A guy dressed in casual clothes and wearing a vest that said SEAWORLD SECURITY approached.</t1579>
<t1580>—What are you doing here?</t1580>
<t1581>He was carrying a can in his hand, which I assumed was pepper spray.</t1581>
<t1582>To calm myself, I wondered: "Are the handcuffs standard, or are they special handcuffs for SeaWorld?</t1582> <t1583>For example, in the shape of two curved dolphins."</t1583>
<t1584>—Actually, we were dating —said Margo.</t1584>
<t1585>—That's for sure —the guard replied to him—.</t1585> <t1586>The question is whether you will walk out or if the Orange County sheriff will have to take you out.</t1586>
<t1587>—If you don't mind, we prefer to walk —Margo replied.</t1587>
<t1588>I closed my eyes.</t1588> <t1589>I wanted to tell Margo that it wasn't the best time for witty comebacks, but the guy laughed.</t1589>
<t1590>—I suppose you know that a couple of years ago a guy jumped into the big aquarium and killed himself, so we have orders not to let anyone out who has snuck in, not even the pretty girls.</t1590>
<t1591>Margo pulled at her shirt to lift it a bit off her body.</t1591> <t1592>And only at that moment did I realize that the guy was talking to her breasts.</t1592>
<t1593>—Well, then I guess you have to arrest us.</t1593>
<t1594>—What happens is that I'm about to leave, go home, have a beer, and sleep for a while, but if I call the police, they'll take their time to come.</t1594> <t1595>I'm just thinking out loud —he said.</t1595>
<t1596>Margo understood it and looked at the sky.</t1596> <t1597>She put a hand in her pocket and took out a hundred-dollar bill that had gotten wet in the pit.</t1597>
<t1598>—Alright —said the guard—, and now it would be best if you leave.</t1598> <t1599>If I were you, I wouldn't go by the whale aquarium.</t1599> <t1600>It's surrounded by security cameras that operate all night, and I don't think you want it known that you've been here.</t1600>
<t1601>—Yes, sir —added Margo demurely.</t1601>
<t1602>And the guy disappeared into the darkness.</t1602>
<t1603>—Damn —murmured Margo as soon as the guy had walked away—, the truth is I didn't want to give money to that degenerate, but, well, money is there to be spent.</t1603>
<t1604>I barely listened to her.</t1604> <t1605>The only thing I felt was relief coursing through my skin.</t1605> <t1606>That pure state of pleasure made up for all the previous worries.</t1606>
<t1607>—Thank God he hasn't reported us —I said.</t1607>
<t1608>Margo didn't answer me.</t1608> <t1609>She was looking ahead with her eyes half-closed.</t1609>
<t1610>—I felt exactly the same when I went to Universal Studios —he said a moment later—.</t1610> <t1611>They are great, although there isn't much to see.</t1611> <t1612>The attractions don't work.</t1612> <t1613>All the cool stuff is closed.</t1613> <t1614>At night, they put almost all the animals in other aquariums.</t1614> <t1615>—He turned his head and looked at SeaWorld, which was in front of us—.</t1615> <t1616>I'm afraid the pleasure is not in being inside.</t1616>
<t1617>—And what is the pleasure? —I asked him.</t1617>
<t1618>—Plan it, I suppose.</t1618> <t1619>I don't know.</t1619> <t1620>Things are never as we expect them to be.</t1620>
<t1621>—It's not that bad for me —I admitted—.</t1621> <t1622>Even though there's nothing to see.</t1622>
<t1623>I sat on a bench and Margo came to sit with me.</t1623> <t1624>We watched the seal aquarium, in which there were no seals.</t1624> <t1625>It was nothing more than an uninhabited islet with plastic protrusions.</t1625> <t1626>I could smell Margo, the sweat and the algae from the moat, her lilac shampoo, and the scent of crushed almonds from her skin.</t1626>
<t1627>For the first time, I felt tired and imagined us lying together on the grass at SeaWorld, me on my back and her on her side, with an arm over me and her head resting on my shoulder, looking at me.</t1627> <t1628>We weren't doing anything.</t1628> <t1629>We were simply lying together under the sky.</t1629> <t1630>The night was so bright that the stars couldn't be seen.</t1630> <t1631>And maybe I felt her breath on my neck, and maybe we would stay there until morning, and then people would pass by us as they entered the park, see us, and think we were tourists too, and we could disappear among them.</t1631>
<t1632>But no.</t1632> <t1633>I had to see Chuck with one eyebrow, and tell the story to Ben, and there were classes, the rehearsal room, Duke University, and the future.</t1633>
<t1634>—Q —said Margo.</t1634>
<t1635>I looked at her and for a moment I didn't understand why she had said my name, but suddenly I woke up from my reverie.</t1635> <t1636>And I heard it.</t1636> <t1637>They had turned up the background music, only it was no longer background music.</t1637> <t1638>It was real music.</t1638> <t1639>An old jazz tune that my father likes called "Stars Fell on Alabama."</t1639> <t1640>Even with those tiny speakers, you could tell that the singer could hit a thousand damn notes at once.</t1640>
<t1641>And I felt that the lines of his life and mine extended from our cradle to the dead guy, from when we met until that moment.</t1641> <t1642>And I wanted to tell him that for me the pleasure was not in planning, doing, or not doing.</t1642> <t1643>The pleasure was in observing our threads crossing, separating, and coming together again.</t1643> <t1644>But it seemed too cheesy to me, and besides, he had already gotten up.</t1644>
<t1645>Margo's very blue eyes blinked.</t1645> <t1646>At that moment, she looked incredibly beautiful, with her wet jeans clinging to her legs and her face glowing in the grayish light.</t1646>
<t1647>I got up, extended my hand, and said to him:</t1647>
<t1648>—Will you grant me this dance?</t1648>
<t1649>Margo curtsied to me and took my hand.</t1649>
<t1650>—I grant you that —he replied to me.</t1650>
<t1651>And then I placed my hand on the curve between her waist and her hip, and she rested hers on my shoulder.</t1651> <t1652>And one two to the side, one two to the side.</t1652> <t1653>We circled the seal aquarium dancing foxtrot, while the song about falling stars kept playing.</t1653>
<t1654>—Slow dance from sixth grade —commented Margo.</t1654>
<t1655>We changed positions.</t1655> <t1656>She placed her hands on my shoulders and I held her by the hips, with elbows closed, half a meter apart.</t1656> <t1657>And then we continued with the foxtrot until the song ended.</t1657> <t1658>I took a step forward and dipped Margo, as we had been taught at the Crown Dance School.</t1658> <t1659>She lifted one leg and let all her weight fall on me.</t1659> <t1660>Either she trusted me or she wanted to fall.</t1660>
<t1661>9</t1661>
<t1662>We bought kitchen rags at a 7-Eleven on International Drive and tried to get the mud and stench from the pit off our clothes and skin.</t1662> <t1663>I filled the gas tank back to where it was before we started the sightseeing tour of Orlando.</t1663> <t1664>The seats of the Chrysler were going to be a bit damp when my mother went to work, but I hoped she wouldn't notice because she was quite absent-minded.</t1664> <t1665>My parents believed I was the most balanced person with the least likelihood of breaking into SeaWorld in the world, as my psychological health was proof of their professional talent.</t1665>
<t1666>I took my time to return home.</t1666> <t1667>I avoided the highways in favor of alternative roads.</t1667> <t1668>Margo and I were listening to the radio and trying to figure out which station had played "Stars Fell on Alabama," but suddenly she turned it off and said:</t1668>
<t1669>—In general, I think it has been a success.</t1669>
<t1670>—Totally —I replied to him.</t1670>
<t1671>Although at that moment I began to wonder what the next day would be like.</t1671> <t1672>Would he stop by the rehearsal room before classes?</t1672> <t1673>Would he have lunch with Ben and me?</t1673>
<t1674>—I wonder if things will change tomorrow —I said to him.</t1674>
<t1675>—Yes —she added—.</t1675> <t1676>Me too.</t1676> <t1677>—She left the comment hanging in the air and then added—: Hey, speaking of tomorrow, I would like to give you a small gift to thank you for your hard work and dedication on this exceptional night.</t1677>
<t1678>He searched among his feet and pulled out the digital camera.</t1678>
<t1679>—Take it —he said to me—.</t1679> <t1680>And use the power of Tiny Winky wisely.</t1680>
<t1681>I laughed and put the camera in my pocket.</t1681>
<t1682>—Should I download the photo when I get home and return it to you at the institute? —I asked him.</t1682>
<t1683>I wanted her to say to me: "Yes, in high school, where everything will be different, where I will be your friend publicly and, moreover, without a boyfriend," but she simply replied: "Yes, or whenever."</t1683>
<t1684>It was 5:42 when we entered Jefferson Park.</t1684> <t1685>We went down Jefferson Drive to Jefferson Court and then turned onto our street, Jefferson Way.</t1685> <t1686>I turned off the lights for the last time and took the path that led to my house.</t1686> <t1687>I didn't know what to say and Margo didn't open her mouth either.</t1687> <t1688>We filled a bag from 7-Eleven with trash to make it look like the Chrysler was as if the last six hours hadn't existed.</t1688> <t1689>Margo gave me another bag with the remains of the Vaseline, the paint can, and the last can of Mountain Dew.</t1689> <t1690>My brain was fighting against exhaustion.</t1690>
<t1691>I stood for a moment in front of the minivan, with a bag in each hand, and looked at Margo.</t1691>
<t1692>—Well, it has been a fantastic night —I finally admitted.</t1692>
<t1693>—Come here —he told me.</t1693>
<t1694>I took a step forward.</t1694> <t1695>He hugged me, and the bags made it difficult for me to hug him back, but if I let them go, I might wake someone up.</t1695> <t1696>I noticed that he stood on tiptoe and suddenly brought his mouth close to my ear and said very clearly:</t1696>
<t1697>—I will miss going out with you.</t1697>
<t1698>—You don't have to —I replied out loud.</t1698> <t1699>I tried to hide my disappointment—.</t1699> <t1700>If you no longer get along with your friends, go out with me.</t1700> <t1701>Mine are very nice.</t1701>
<t1702>Her lips were so close to me that I could feel her smile.</t1702>
<t1703>—I'm afraid it's not possible —he whispered.</t1703>
<t1704>He stepped back, but kept looking at me as he retreated step by step.</t1704> <t1705>In the end, he raised his eyebrows, smiled, and I believed his smile.</t1705> <t1706>I watched her climb a tree and ascend to the ledge of her bedroom window on the second floor.</t1706> <t1707>She opened the window and slipped inside.</t1707>
<t1708>I entered through the main door, which was not locked, tiptoed across the kitchen to my room, took off my jeans, threw them in a corner of the closet next to the window screen, downloaded Jase's photo, and got into bed thinking about what I would say to Margo at school.</t1708>
<t1709>SECOND PART</t1709>
<t1710>The grass</t1710>
<t1711>1</t1711>
<t1712>I had slept for about half an hour when the alarm clock went off.</t1712> <t1713>6:32.</t1713> <t1714>But for seventeen minutes I didn't even realize that the alarm clock was ringing, until I felt hands on my shoulders and heard my mother's distant voice.</t1714>
<t1715>—Good morning, sleepyhead —he said to me.</t1715>
<t1716>—Ugh —I replied.</t1716>
<t1717>I felt quite a bit more tired than at 5:55, and I would have skipped classes, but I didn't have a single absence, and although I was aware that not having absences was not particularly impressive nor necessarily admirable, I wanted to keep that streak going.</t1717> <t1718>Besides, I wanted to see how Margo would react to me.</t1718>
<t1719>When I entered the kitchen, my father was telling my mother something while they were having breakfast at the counter.</t1719> <t1720>Upon seeing me, my father interrupted what he was saying and asked me:</t1720>
<t1721>—How did you sleep?</t1721>
<t1722>—Marvelous —I told him.</t1722>
<t1723>And it was true.</t1723> <t1724>He had slept little, but well.</t1724>
<t1725>He smiled.</t1725>
<t1726>—I was telling your mother that I have a recurring and distressing dream —he explained to me—.</t1726> <t1727>I'm at the university, in a Hebrew class, although the professor doesn't speak Hebrew and the exams are not in Hebrew.</t1727> <t1728>They are in an incomprehensible jargon.</t1728> <t1729>But everyone acts as if that invented language, with an invented alphabet, were Hebrew.</t1729> <t1730>So I have that exam in front of me and I must write in a language I don't know using an alphabet I can't decipher.</t1730>
<t1731>—Interesting —I said, although it didn't really seem that way to me.</t1731> <t1732>There is nothing more boring than other people's dreams.</t1732>
<t1733>—It's a metaphor for adolescence —my mother interjected—.</t1733> <t1734>Writing in a language (adulthood) that you don't understand and using an alphabet (mature social interaction) that you don't recognize.</t1734>
<t1735>My mother worked with crazy teenagers in juvenile centers and prisons.</t1735> <t1736>I think that's why she never worried about me.</t1736> <t1737>Since I didn't spend my time decapitating rodents or peeing on my own face, it was clear that I was a success.</t1737>
<t1738>A normal mother might have said, "Hey, you look like you're feeling down after bingeing on methamphetamines and you smell like something similar to seaweed.</t1738> <t1739>By any chance, were you dancing with Margo Roth Spiegelman a couple of hours ago, who had just been bitten by a snake?"</t1739> <t1740>But no.</t1740> <t1741>My parents preferred dreams.</t1741>
<t1742>I took a shower and put on a t-shirt and some jeans.</t1742> <t1743>I was running late, but I was always running late.</t1743>
<t1744>—You're late —my mother told me when I returned to the kitchen.</t1744>
<t1745>I tried to clear my mind enough to remember how to tie my sneakers.</t1745>
<t1746>—I am aware —I replied half asleep.</t1746>
<t1747>My mother took me to the institute.</t1747> <t1748>I sat in the seat where Margo had sat.</t1748> <t1749>My mother barely spoke during the trip, luckily, because I was completely asleep, with my head resting on the car window.</t1749>
<t1750>When my mother dropped me off at the high school, I saw that the senior student parking spot where Margo usually parked was empty.</t1750> <t1751>The truth is, I couldn't blame her for being late.</t1751> <t1752>Her friends didn't meet up as early as mine did.</t1752>
<t1753>As I approached the boys in the band, Ben shouted:</t1753>
<t1754>—Jacobsen, was I dreaming or…?</t1754> <t1755>—I gave him a discreet nod and he changed the second part of the sentence—.</t1755> <t1756>Or did you and I have a wild adventure last night in French Polynesia, traveling on a boat made of bananas?</t1756>
<t1757>—A beautiful ship —I replied.</t1757>
<t1758>Radar looked at me, raised his eyebrows, and walked towards a tree.</t1758> <t1759>I followed him.</t1759>
<t1760>—I asked Angela if she wanted to go to the dance with Ben.</t1760> <t1761>Not even drunk.</t1761>
<t1762>I looked at Ben, who was chatting animatedly.</t1762> <t1763>A plastic spoon was dancing in his mouth as he spoke.</t1763>
<t1764>—What the hell —I said—.</t1764> <t1765>But it's okay.</t1765> <t1766>We'll stay together and have a marathon session of Resurrection or something like that.</t1766>
<t1767>Ben approached.</t1767>
<t1768>—Are you pretending?</t1768> <t1769>Because I know you are talking about the drama of the dance without partners that is my life.</t1769>
<t1770>He turned around and went inside.</t1770> <t1771>Radar and I followed him and crossed through the rehearsal room, where the first and second-year students were chatting while sitting among a bunch of instrument cases.</t1771>
<t1772>—Why do you want to go? —I asked him.</t1772>
<t1773>—Buddy, it's our prom.</t1773> <t1774>It's my last chance to become a fond memory of high school for some girl.</t1774>
<t1775>I looked at the ceiling.</t1775>
<t1776>The first bell rang, which meant that there were five minutes left before classes started, and everyone started running like Pavlov's dogs.</t1776> <t1777>The hallways filled with people.</t1777> <t1778>Ben, Radar, and I stopped next to Radar's locker.</t1778>
<t1779>—Well, why did you call me at three in the morning to ask for Chuck Parson's address?</t1779>
<t1780>I was thinking about how to respond to his question when I saw Chuck Parson coming towards us.</t1780> <t1781>I elbowed Ben and pointed at Chuck with my eyes.</t1781> <t1782>By the way, Chuck had decided that the best strategy was to shave his left eyebrow.</t1782>
<t1783>—What a pain in the ass —said Ben.</t1783>
<t1784>At that moment, Chuck pushed me against the locker and brought his face close to mine, a pretty face without eyebrows.</t1784>
<t1785>—What are you looking at, dumbass?</t1785>
<t1786>—Nothing —Radar replied to him—.</t1786> <t1787>We're definitely not looking at your eyebrows.</t1787>
<t1788>Chuck shoved Radar, hit the locker with the palm of his hand, and walked away.</t1788>
<t1789>—Did you do it? —Ben asked me, incredulous.</t1789>
<t1790>—Don't tell anyone —I said to both of them.</t1790> <t1791>And I added in a low voice—: I was with Margo Roth Spiegelman.</t1791>
<t1792>Ben raised his voice excitedly.</t1792>
<t1793>—Were you with Margo Roth Spiegelman last night? At three in the morning?</t1793> <t1794>—I nodded—.</t1794> <t1795>Alone? —I nodded—.</t1795> <t1796>Damn, if you hooked up with her, you have to tell me every single detail.</t1796> <t1797>You have to write me an essay about the look and feel of Margo Roth Spiegelman's boobs.</t1797> <t1798>Thirty pages at least.</t1798>
<t1799>—I want you to make a realistic pencil drawing —Radar asked me.</t1799>
<t1800>—We also accept a sculpture —added Ben.</t1800>
<t1801>Radar raised a hand.</t1801> <t1802>I obediently high-fived it.</t1802>
<t1803>—Yes, I was wondering if it would be possible for you to write a sestina about Margo Roth Spiegelman's tits.</t1803> <t1804>Your keywords are: "Pink," "Round," "Firm," "Succulent," "Flexible," and "Soft" —Radar told me.</t1804>
<t1805>—Personally —said Ben—, I think at least one of the words should be "turturturtur."</t1805>
<t1806>—I don't think I know that word —I added.</t1806>
<t1807>—It's the sound I make with my mouth when I stick my face between a chick's tits.</t1807>
<t1808>At that point, Ben mimicked what he would do in the unlikely event that his face ever encountered some breasts.</t1808>
<t1809>—Right now —I said—, although they don't know why, thousands of girls all over the country feel a shiver of fear and disgust running down their spines.</t1809> <t1810>Anyway, I didn't hook up with her, pervert.</t1810>
<t1811>—Always the same —Ben replied to me—.</t1811> <t1812>I'm the only guy I know with the balls to give a chick what she wants and the only one who doesn't get the chance to do it.</t1812>
<t1813>—What a strange coincidence —I told him.</t1813>
<t1814>Life was as usual, only I was more tired.</t1814> <t1815>I had hoped that the previous night would change my life, but it hadn't been so.</t1815> <t1816>At least for now.</t1816>
<t1817>The second bell rang and we immediately went to class.</t1817>
<t1818>During the first calculus class, I felt tremendously tired.</t1818> <t1819>Well, I had been tired since I woke up, but combining tiredness with calculus seemed unfair to me.</t1819> <t1820>To stay awake, I dedicated myself to writing a note to Margo —considering that I wasn't going to send it, it was just a simple summary of my favorite moments from the previous night—, but even that didn't work.</t1820> <t1821>At a certain point, my pen stopped moving and I felt my field of vision narrowing more and more, so I tried to remember if tunnel vision was a symptom of tiredness.</t1821> <t1822>I concluded that it must be, because before me I saw only one thing, Mr. Jiminez at the board, it was the only thing my brain processed, and when Mr. Jiminez said "Quentin?", I was very confused, because the only thing happening in my universe was Mr. Jiminez writing on the board, so I didn't understand how he could be both an acoustic and visual presence at the same time.</t1822>
<t1823>—Yes? —I asked him.</t1823>
<t1824>—Have you heard the question?</t1824>
<t1825>—Yes? —I asked again.</t1825>
<t1826>—And did you raise your hand to answer?</t1826>
<t1827>I raised my eyes, and of course, my hand was raised, but I didn't know how it had gotten there.</t1827> <t1828>The only thing I somewhat knew was how to lower it.</t1828> <t1829>After considerable effort, my brain managed to tell my arm to lower, and my arm managed to lower.</t1829>
<t1830>—I just wanted to ask if I can go to the bathroom —I finally said.</t1830>
<t1831>—Go —the professor replied to me.</t1831>
<t1832>And then someone raised their hand and asked something about differential equations.</t1832>
<t1833>I went to the bathroom, splashed water on my face, approached the mirror above the sink, and observed myself.</t1833> <t1834>I rubbed my eyes to eliminate the redness, but I couldn't.</t1834> <t1835>And then a brilliant idea occurred to me.</t1835> <t1836>I entered a stall, lowered the lid, sat down, leaned against the wall, and fell asleep.</t1836> <t1837>The sleep lasted about sixteen milliseconds, until the bell for the second period rang.</t1837> <t1838>I got up and went to Latin class, then to physics, and finally it was lunchtime.</t1838> <t1839>I found Ben in the cafeteria.</t1839>
<t1840>—I need a nap —I told him.</t1840>
<t1841>—Let's go eat at Chuco —he answered me.</t1841>
<t1842>The Chuco was a fifteen-year-old Buick that Ben's three older brothers had driven with impunity, so by the time it got to him, it was basically duct tape and putty.</t1842> <t1843>Its full name was Churro de Coche, but we called it Chuco for short.</t1843> <t1844>The Chuco didn't run on gasoline, but on the inexhaustible fuel of hope.</t1844> <t1845>You would sit on the scorching plastic seat and wait for it to start, then Ben would turn the key and the engine would turn over a couple of times, like a fish out of water giving its last flaps before dying.</t1845> <t1846>You kept waiting and the engine would turn over a couple more times.</t1846> <t1847>You waited some more and eventually it would start.</t1847>
<t1848>Ben turned on the Chuco and cranked the air conditioning to the max.</t1848> <t1849>Three of the four windows wouldn't open, but the air conditioning worked wonderfully, although for the first few minutes it was nothing but hot air coming out of the vents and mixing with the stale air of the car.</t1849> <t1850>I reclined the passenger seat all the way back until I was almost lying down and told him everything: Margo at my window, the Walmart, the revenge, the SunTrust Building, entering a house that wasn't ours, the SeaWorld, and the I'll miss going out with you.</t1850>
<t1851>Ben did not interrupt me even once —he was a good friend when it came to not interrupting—, but as soon as I finished, he asked me the most pressing question for him.</t1851>
<t1852>—Wait, when you say that Jase Worthington has a small one, how small exactly?</t1852>
<t1853>—It’s possible it shrank, because he was super stressed, but have you ever seen a pencil? —I asked him, and Ben nodded—.</t1853> <t1854>Well, have you ever seen the eraser on a pencil?</t1854> <t1855>—He nodded again—.</t1855> <t1856>Well, have you ever seen the eraser shavings left on the paper when you've erased something?</t1856> <t1857>—He nodded again—.</t1857> <t1858>I’d say three shavings long by one wide.</t1858>
<t1859>Ben had swallowed a lot of crap from guys like Jason Worthington and Chuck Parson, so I thought he had the right to have a little fun.</t1859> <t1860>But he didn't even laugh.</t1860> <t1861>He just shook his head slowly, astonished.</t1861>
<t1862>—Damn, Margo is freaking awesome.</t1862>
<t1863>—I know.</t1863>
<t1864>—He is one of those people who either dies tragically at twenty-seven, like Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin, or later in life wins the first Nobel Prize for Genius.</t1864>
<t1865>—Yes —I told him.</t1865>
<t1866>Rarely did I tire of talking about Margo Roth Spiegelman, but rarely was I this tired.</t1866> <t1867>I leaned back against the cracked plastic headrest and fell asleep instantly.</t1867> <t1868>When I woke up, I had a Wendy's burger on my knees and a note: "Had to go to class, buddy.</t1868> <t1869>See you after rehearsal."</t1869>
<t1870>Later, after my last class, I translated Ovid while leaning against the exterior cement wall of the rehearsal room, trying to ignore the dissonances coming from inside.</t1870> <t1871>I always stayed at the school during the extra rehearsal hour, because leaving before Ben and Radar meant the unbearable humiliation of being the only senior on the bus.</t1871>
<t1872>When they left, Ben took Radar to his house, towards the "center" of Jefferson Park, near where Lacey lived, and then he accompanied me.</t1872> <t1873>I saw that Margo's car wasn't parked at her house either, so she hadn't skipped classes to sleep.</t1873> <t1874>She would have skipped classes for another one of her adventures, an adventure without me.</t1874> <t1875>She was probably spending the day spreading depilatory cream on the pillows of other enemies or something like that.</t1875> <t1876>I entered the house feeling a bit abandoned, although of course Margo knew that I wouldn't have gone with her anyway, because I wouldn't want to miss a day of class.</t1876> <t1877>And who knew if it would have been just one day.</t1877> <t1878>Maybe she had gone on another three-day excursion through Mississippi or had temporarily joined the circus.</t1878> <t1879>But it wouldn't be either of those things, of course.</t1879> <t1880>It was something I couldn't imagine, would never imagine, because I couldn't be Margo.</t1880>
<t1881>I wondered what stories he would come home with this time.</t1881> <t1882>And I wondered if he would sit in front of me at mealtime and tell me about them.</t1882> <t1883>I thought that maybe that's what he meant when he said he would miss going out with me.</t1883> <t1884>I knew he would go somewhere to take another of his brief breaks from Orlando, the paper town.</t1884> <t1885>But when he came back, who knew?</t1885> <t1886>He couldn't spend the last weeks of school with the friends he had always had, so maybe after all, he would spend them with me.</t1886>
<t1887>It didn't take long for the rumors to start spreading.</t1887> <t1888>Ben called me that night, after dinner.</t1888>
<t1889>—I have heard that he doesn't answer the phone.</t1889> <t1890>Someone mentioned on Facebook that he said he might move to a secret warehouse in Tomorrowland, at Disneyland.</t1890>
<t1891>—What nonsense —I told him.</t1891>
<t1892>—I already know.</t1892> <t1893>Well, Tomorrowland is by far the tackiest part.</t1893> <t1894>And someone said they met a guy online.</t1894>
<t1895>—Ridiculous —I insisted.</t1895>
<t1896>—Okay, very well, but then?</t1896>
<t1897>—He must be out there having fun on his own in something we can't even imagine —I replied to him.</t1897>
<t1898>Ben let out a chuckle.</t1898>
<t1899>—Are you saying she likes to have fun alone?</t1899>
<t1900>I grunted.</t1900>
<t1901>—Come on, Ben.</t1901> <t1902>I mean, he must be doing his own things.</t1902> <t1903>Making up stories.</t1903> <t1904>Turning the world upside down.</t1904>
<t1905>That night I lay on my side in bed and observed the invisible world on the other side of the window.</t1905> <t1906>I tried to fall asleep, but my eyes kept opening every so often to check.</t1906> <t1907>I couldn't help but hope that Margo Roth Spiegelman would come back to my window and drag my tired ass through another unforgettable night.</t1907>
<t1908>2</t1908>
<t1909>Margo escaped so often that in high school no patrols were organized to look for her, but we all felt her absence.</t1909> <t1910>High school is neither a democracy nor a dictatorship.</t1910> <t1911>Nor, as is often believed, an anarchic state.</t1911> <t1912>High school is a monarchy by divine right.</t1912> <t1913>And when the queen goes on vacation, things change.</t1913> <t1914>Specifically, for the worse.</t1914> <t1915>For example, in sophomore year, when Margo was traveling through Mississippi, Becca released the story of Bloody Ben to the world.</t1915> <t1916>And this time was no different.</t1916> <t1917>The girl who used to plug the holes had left.</t1917> <t1918>The flood was inevitable.</t1918>
<t1919>That morning, since for once I was punctual, Ben drove me to school.</t1919> <t1920>We found everyone strangely silent at the door of the rehearsal room.</t1920>
<t1921>—Uncle —said our friend Frank very seriously.</t1921>
<t1922>—What's happening?</t1922>
<t1923>—Chuck Parson, Taddy Mac, and Clint Bauer took Clint's Tahoe and ran over twelve bikes belonging to first and second-year students.</t1923>
<t1924>—Don't mess with me —I replied, shaking my head.</t1924>
<t1925>—And yesterday someone posted our phone numbers in the boys' bathroom with... well, with obscenities —added our friend Ashley.</t1925>
<t1926>I shook my head again and I too remained silent.</t1926> <t1927>We couldn't report them.</t1927> <t1928>We had tried many times before high school, and the inevitable result had been that they bullied us even more.</t1928> <t1929>In general, we could only hope that someone like Margo would remind them how immature and idiotic they were.</t1929>
<t1930>But Margo had taught me a way to start the counteroffensive.</t1930> <t1931>And I was about to say something when I saw out of the corner of my eye a tall guy running towards us.</t1931> <t1932>He was wearing a black ski mask and holding a sophisticated green water cannon in his hands.</t1932> <t1933>As he passed, he hit me on the shoulder, I lost my balance and landed on my side on the cracked cement.</t1933> <t1934>When he reached the door, he turned and shouted at me:</t1934>
<t1935>—You dedicate yourself to screwing us over, so we're going to impale you.</t1935>
<t1936>The voice didn't sound familiar to me at all.</t1936>
<t1937>Ben and another friend helped me get up.</t1937> <t1938>My shoulder hurt, but I didn't want to rub it.</t1938>
<t1939>—Are you okay? —Radar asked me.</t1939>
<t1940>—Yes, very well.</t1940>
<t1941>Then I did rub my shoulder.</t1941>
<t1942>Radar shook his head.</t1942>
<t1943>—Someone should explain to him that, although it is possible to give a beating, and also to administer a beating, it is not possible to "beating-ize" anyone.</t1943>
<t1944>I laughed.</t1944> <t1945>Someone pointed to the parking lot, I looked up and saw two first-year kids approaching us with wet and sagging shirts.</t1945>
<t1946>—They were pissed! —one of them shouted at us.</t1946>
<t1947>The other said nothing.</t1947> <t1948>He just kept pulling his hands away from the shirt, which didn't quite work.</t1948> <t1949>I saw streams running down from the sleeves to his arms.</t1949>
<t1950>—Animal or human urine? —someone asked.</t1950>
<t1951>—How am I supposed to know!</t1951> <t1952>What, am I an expert in piss?</t1952>
<t1953>I approached the boy and placed my hand on his head, which was the only thing that seemed completely dry.</t1953>
<t1954>—This is not going to stay like this —I told him.</t1954>
<t1955>The second bell rang and Radar and I ran to calculus class.</t1955> <t1956>As I sat down at my desk, I hit my arm, and the pain shot up to my shoulder.</t1956> <t1957>Radar pointed to his notebook, where he had written a note surrounded by a circle: "Shoulder OK?".</t1957>
<t1958>I wrote in the corner of my notebook: "Compared to the little kids, I have spent the morning in a field of rainbows playing with little animals."</t1958>
<t1959>Radar laughed so loudly that Mr. Jiminez gave him a look.</t1959> <t1960>I wrote: "I have a plan, but we need to find out who he was."</t1960>
<t1961>Radar wrote "Jasper Hanson" and circled it several times.</t1961> <t1962>I was surprised.</t1962>
<t1963>"How do you know?"</t1963>
<t1964>Radar wrote: "Didn't you see him? The idiot was wearing the football jersey with his name on it."</t1964>
<t1965>Jasper Hanson was a third-year student.</t1965> <t1966>He had always thought he was a quiet and nice guy, one of those slightly clumsy ones who ask you: "Dude, how's it going?".</t1966> <t1967>He didn't expect to see him launching geysers of pee at the first-years.</t1967> <t1968>Honestly, in the governmental hierarchy of Winter Park High School, Jasper Hanson was like the assistant deputy of Athletics and Illicit Activities.</t1968> <t1969>When a guy like that gets promoted to executive vice president of Urinary Armament, you have to take immediate action.</t1969>
<t1970>So as soon as I got home that afternoon, I created an email account and immediately wrote to my old friend Jason Worthington.</t1970>
<t1971>From: mvengador@gmail.</t1971> <t1972>com</t1972>
<t1973>A: jworthington90@yahoo.</t1973> <t1974>com</t1974>
<t1975>Subject: You, me, Becca Arrington's house, your penis, etc.</t1975>
<t1976>Dear Mr. Worthington,</t1976>
<t1977>1.</t1977> <t1978>You must give two hundred dollars in cash to each of the twelve people whose bicycles were destroyed by your friends with the Chevy Tahoe.</t1978> <t1979>It shouldn't be a problem for you, given your immense wealth.</t1979>
<t1980>2.</t1980> <t1981>The issue of graffiti in the boys' bathroom must come to an end.</t1981>
<t1982>3.</t1982> <t1983>Water cannons? With urine? Really?</t1983> <t1984>Grow up a little.</t1984>
<t1985>4.</t1985> <t1986>You should treat your peers with respect, especially those who are socially less fortunate than you.</t1986>
<t1987>5.</t1987> <t1988>He should probably instruct the members of his clan to behave considerately as well.</t1988>
<t1989>I am aware that completing some of these tasks will be very difficult.</t1989> <t1990>But in that case, it will also be very difficult not to share the attached photograph with everyone.</t1990>
<t1991>Cordially,</t1991>
<t1992>your friendly neighbor Nemesis</t1992>
<t1993>Twelve minutes later, his response arrived.</t1993>
<t1994>Look, Quentin, because yes, I know it's you.</t1994> <t1995>You know it wasn't me who sprayed the first-year kids with pee.</t1995> <t1996>I'm sorry, but I can't control what others do.</t1996>
<t1997>My response:</t1997>
<t1998>Mr. Worthington:</t1998>
<t1999>I understand that you don't control Chuck and Jasper.</t1999> <t2000>But, you see, I am in a situation similar to yours.</t2000> <t2001>I don't control the little devil sitting on my left shoulder.</t2001> <t2002>The devil tells me: "PRINT THE PHOTO PRINT THE PHOTO HANG IT ALL OVER THE INSTITUTE DO IT DO IT DO IT."</t2002> <t2003>But on my right shoulder, I have a little white angel.</t2003> <t2004>And the angel tells me: "Man, I bet those first-year kids get their money first thing Monday morning."</t2004>
<t2005>Me too, little angel, me too.</t2005>
<t2006>My best wishes,</t2006>
<t2007>Your friendly neighbor Nemesis.</t2007>
<t2008>He didn't answer me, although it wasn't necessary.</t2008> <t2009>We had already said everything to each other.</t2009>
<t2010>Ben stopped by my house after dinner and we were playing Resurrection, pausing roughly every half hour to call Radar, who had gone out with Angela.</t2010> <t2011>We left him eleven messages, each one more impertinent and lascivious than the previous.</t2011> <t2012>It was past nine when the doorbell rang.</t2012>
<t2013>—Quentin! —shouted my mother.</t2013>
<t2014>Ben and I assumed it was Radar, so we paused the game and went out to the dining room.</t2014> <t2015>Chuck Parson and Jason Worthington were at the entrance.</t2015> <t2016>I approached them.</t2016>
<t2017>—Hello, Quentin —said Jason.</t2017>
<t2018>I greeted him with a nod.</t2018> <t2019>Jason glanced at Chuck, who looked at me and murmured:</t2019>
<t2020>—Sorry, Quentin.</t2020>
<t2021>—Why? —I asked him.</t2021>
<t2022>—For telling Jasper to shoot pee at the first-year kids —he murmured.</t2022> <t2023>He paused and continued—: And for the bikes.</t2023>
<t2024>Ben opened his arms, as if he were going to hug him.</t2024>
<t2025>—Come here, buddy —he said to him.</t2025>
<t2026>—What?</t2026>
<t2027>—That you come —he repeated to her.</t2027>
<t2028>Chuck took a step forward.</t2028>
<t2029>—Closer —said Ben.</t2029>
<t2030>Chuck advanced to the entrance, a step ahead of Ben.</t2030> <t2031>And suddenly, Ben punched him in the stomach.</t2031> <t2032>Chuck barely flinched.</t2032> <t2033>He took a step back to hit Ben, but Jase grabbed him by the arm.</t2033>
<t2034>—Calm down, buddy —Jase told him—.</t2034> <t2035>It didn't hurt that much either.</t2035>
<t2036>He extended his hand for me to shake it.</t2036>
<t2037>—I like that you have guts, mate.</t2037> <t2038>Well, you're an asshole.</t2038> <t2039>But it doesn't matter.</t2039>
<t2040>I shook his hand.</t2040>
<t2041>They got into Jase's Lexus, backed up, and drove away.</t2041> <t2042>As soon as I closed the door, Ben let out a loud roar.</t2042>
<t2043>—Ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy.</t2043> <t2044>Damn, my hand.</t2044> <t2045>—Ben tried to close his fist and grimaced in pain—.</t2045> <t2046>I think Chuck Parson had put a book in his stomach.</t2046>
<t2047>—They are called sit-ups —I explained to him.</t2047>
<t2048>—Yes, of course.</t2048> <t2049>I've heard of them.</t2049>
<t2050>I gave him a pat on the back and we went back to the room to continue playing Resurrection.</t2050> <t2051>We had just taken off the pause when Ben said:</t2051>
<t2052>—By the way, have you noticed that Jase says "mate"?</t2052> <t2053>I've brought it back into fashion.</t2053> <t2054>And only with the power of my brilliance.</t2054>
<t2055>—Yes, you spend Friday night playing and nursing your hand, which you broke trying to punch a guy.</t2055> <t2056>No wonder Jase Worthington has decided to cozy up to your tree.</t2056>
<t2057>—At least I'm good at Resurrection —he told me.</t2057>
<t2058>And he shot me in the back, even though we were playing as a team.</t2058>
<t2059>We played a little longer, until Ben curled up on the floor, with the controller pressed to his chest, and fell asleep.</t2059> <t2060>I was tired too.</t2060> <t2061>It had been a long day.</t2061> <t2062>I assumed that Margo would be back on Monday, but even so, I felt a bit proud of having been the person who had stopped the storm.</t2062>
<t2063>3</t2063>
<t2064>Every morning I looked out the window of my room to check if there was any sign of life in Margo's room.</t2064> <t2065>She always had the wicker blinds down, but since she had left, her mother or someone else in the house had raised them, so I could see a bit of blue wall and white ceiling.</t2065> <t2066>That Saturday morning, since it had only been forty-eight hours since she had run away, I assumed she still wouldn't be home, but I still felt a bit disappointed to see that the blind was still up.</t2066>
<t2067>I brushed my teeth and then, after giving Ben a few little kicks to try to wake him up, I went out in shorts and a t-shirt.</t2067> <t2068>There were five people sitting at the dining table: my parents, Margo's parents, and a tall, burly African American man with huge glasses, a gray suit, and a brown folder in his hands.</t2068>
<t2069>—Oh, hi —I said.</t2069>
<t2070>—Quentin, did you see Margo on Wednesday night? —my mother asked me.</t2070>
<t2071>I entered the dining room and leaned against the wall, facing the stranger.</t2071> <t2072>I already had the answer to that question thought out.</t2072>
<t2073>—Yes —I answered him—.</t2073> <t2074>She appeared at my window around twelve, we talked for a minute and then Mr. Spiegelman caught her and she had to go back home.</t2074>
<t2075>—And that was...? Have you seen her since? —Mr. Spiegelman asked me.</t2075>
<t2076>He seemed quite calm.</t2076>
<t2077>—No, why? —I asked.</t2077>
<t2078>—Well —Margo's mother replied in a sharp tone—, it looks like Margo has run away.</t2078> <t2079>Again.</t2079> <t2080>—She sighed—.</t2080> <t2081>This must be… how many times now, Josh? Four?</t2081>
<t2082>—Ugh, I've lost count —replied her husband, annoyed.</t2082>
<t2083>Then the African American intervened.</t2083>
<t2084>—The fifth time they have filed a complaint.</t2084> <t2085>—He greeted me with a nod and said—: Detective Otis Warren.</t2085>
<t2086>—Quentin Jacobsen —I said.</t2086>
<t2087>My mother stood up and placed her hands on Mrs. Spiegelman's shoulders.</t2087>
<t2088>—Debbie —he said—, I'm very sorry.</t2088> <t2089>It's a very frustrating situation.</t2089>
<t2090>I knew that trick.</t2090> <t2091>It was a psychological trick called empathetic listening.</t2091> <t2092>You say what the person is feeling so that they feel understood.</t2092> <t2093>My mother does it with me all the time.</t2093>
<t2094>—I am not frustrated —Mrs. Spiegelman replied to him—.</t2094> <t2095>It's over.</t2095>
<t2096>—Exactly —said Mr. Spiegelman—.</t2096> <t2097>This afternoon a locksmith will come.</t2097> <t2098>We will change the locks.</t2098> <t2099>He is eighteen years old.</t2099> <t2100>Anyway, the detective just told us that we can't do anything...</t2100>
<t2101>—Well —Detective Warren interrupted him—, I didn't say that exactly.</t2101> <t2102>I said that she is not a minor, so she has the right to leave home.</t2102>
<t2103>Mr. Spiegelman continued talking with my mother.</t2103>
<t2104>—We are okay with paying for her college, but we are not going to tolerate these… these foolishness.</t2104> <t2105>Connie, she is eighteen years old! And she is still self-centered!</t2105> <t2106>She needs to see the consequences.</t2106>
<t2107>My mother removed her hands from Mrs. Spiegelman's shoulders.</t2107>
<t2108>—I would say that the consequences to consider are those of affection —my mother told him.</t2108>
<t2109>—Well, she's not your daughter, Connie.</t2109> <t2110>She hasn't been walking all over you like a doormat for ten years.</t2110> <t2111>We have to think about our other daughter.</t2111>
<t2112>—And in us —added Mr. Spiegelman.</t2112> <t2113>He looked up at me—.</t2113> <t2114>Quentin, I'm sorry she tried to involve you in her little game.</t2114> <t2115>You can imagine how... how embarrassed we are.</t2115> <t2116>You're a good boy, and she... Well.</t2116>
<t2117>I separated myself from the wall and stood up, very stiff.</t2117> <t2118>I knew Margo's parents a little, but I had never seen them act with such bad temper.</t2118> <t2119>It didn't surprise me that she was angry with them on Wednesday night.</t2119> <t2120>I looked at the detective.</t2120> <t2121>He was flipping through the pages of the folder.</t2121>
<t2122>—He has always left some trace, hasn't he? —he said.</t2122>
<t2123>—Clues —Mr. Spiegelman replied, standing up.</t2123>
<t2124>The detective left the folder on the table, and Margo's father leaned in to take a look.</t2124>
<t2125>—Clues everywhere.</t2125> <t2126>The day she left for Mississippi, she ate alphabet soup and left exactly four letters in the bowl: an M, an I, an S, and a P.</t2126> <t2127>She was disappointed because we couldn't put them together, although, as I told her when she finally returned: "How are we supposed to find you if all we know is 'Mississippi'?</t2127> <t2128>It's a big state, Margo."</t2128>
<t2129>The detective cleared his throat.</t2129>
<t2130>—And he left Minnie Mouse on his bed when he sneaked into Disney World one night.</t2130>
<t2131>—Yes —said his mother—.</t2131> <t2132>Clues.</t2132> <t2133>Stupid clues.</t2133> <t2134>But you can never follow them, believe me.</t2134>
<t2135>The detective lifted his eyes from the folder.</t2135>
<t2136>—We will spread the word, of course, but we cannot force her to return home in any way.</t2136> <t2137>You should not necessarily count on her coming back under your roof in the immediate future.</t2137>
<t2138>—I don't want her under our roof.</t2138> <t2139>—Mrs. Spiegelman brought a handkerchief to her eyes, although she didn't seem to be crying—.</t2139> <t2140>I know it's terrible, but it's the truth.</t2140>
<t2141>—Deb —said my mother in her psychologist tone.</t2141>
<t2142>Mrs. Spiegelman merely nodded slightly.</t2142>
<t2143>—What can we do?</t2143> <t2144>We have told the detective.</t2144> <t2145>We have filed a report.</t2145> <t2146>She is an adult, Connie.</t2146>
<t2147>—She is your adult daughter —said my mother, still calm.</t2147>
<t2148>—Let's go, Connie.</t2148> <t2149>Isn't it crazy that we're delighted she left home?</t2149> <t2150>Of course it's crazy.</t2150> <t2151>But she was driving the whole family crazy.</t2151> <t2152>How do you look for someone who insists they won't be found, who always leaves clues that lead nowhere, who escapes every now and then? It's impossible!</t2152>
<t2153>My mother and my father looked at each other, and then the detective turned to me.</t2153>
<t2154>—Son, I wonder if we could talk in private.</t2154>
<t2155>I nodded.</t2155> <t2156>We went into my parents' room.</t2156> <t2157>He sat in an armchair and I sat on the edge of the bed.</t2157>
<t2158>—Boy —he said to me once he had settled into the armchair—, allow me to give you some advice: never work for the government.</t2158> <t2159>Because when you work for the government, you work for the people.</t2159> <t2160>And when you work for the people, you have to interact with them, even with the Spiegelmans.</t2160>
<t2161>I let out a giggle.</t2161>
<t2162>—Allow me to be honest with you, kid —he continued saying to me—.</t2162> <t2163>These people know as much about being parents as I do about dieting.</t2163> <t2164>I've worked with them before and I don't like them.</t2164> <t2165>I don't care if you don't tell Margo's parents where she is, but I would appreciate it if you told me.</t2165>
<t2166>—I don't know —I replied—.</t2166> <t2167>Honestly, I don't know.</t2167>
<t2168>—Boy, I've been thinking about the girl.</t2168> <t2169>What she does...</t2169> <t2170>She sneaks into Disney World, for example, right?</t2170> <t2171>She goes to Mississippi and leaves clues with alphabet soup.</t2171> <t2172>She organizes a big campaign to toilet paper houses.</t2172>
<t2173>—How do you know?</t2173>
<t2174>Two years ago, Margo had led the wallpapering of two hundred houses in a single night.</t2174> <t2175>It goes without saying that she didn't invite me to participate in that adventure.</t2175>
<t2176>—I have worked on this case before.</t2176> <t2177>So, kid, I need you to help me.</t2177> <t2178>Who plans these things?</t2178> <t2179>These crazy projects?</t2179> <t2180>She is the spokesperson for all of this, the only one crazy enough to do it.</t2180> <t2181>But who plans it?</t2181> <t2182>Who sits with notebooks full of diagrams to calculate how much toilet paper is needed to wallpaper a bunch of houses?</t2182>
<t2183>—I suppose her.</t2183>
<t2184>—But she must have a partner, someone who helps her do all these outrageous and brilliant things.</t2184> <t2185>And maybe the person who shares her secret is not the most obvious one, not her best friend or her boyfriend.</t2185> <t2186>Maybe it's someone you would never think of —he told me.</t2186>
<t2187>The detective took a breath and was about to say something else when I interrupted him.</t2187>
<t2188>—I don't know where it is.</t2188> <t2189>I swear to God.</t2189>
<t2190>—I just wanted to make sure, boy.</t2190> <t2191>Anyway, you know something, right?</t2191> <t2192>Let's start from there.</t2192>
<t2193>I told him everything.</t2193> <t2194>I trusted that guy.</t2194> <t2195>He took some notes while I talked, though without too many details.</t2195> <t2196>But in telling him, and seeing him scribbling in the notebook, and realizing the stupidity of Margo's parents... for the first time, I considered the possibility that she might have disappeared for a long time.</t2196> <t2197>When I finished talking, I was so worried that I started to run out of breath.</t2197> <t2198>The detective didn't say anything for a while.</t2198> <t2199>He leaned forward and looked into the distance until he found what he was looking for, and then he started to speak.</t2199>
<t2200>—Look, kid.</t2200> <t2201>Here's the thing: someone with a free spirit, usually a girl, doesn't get along too well with her parents.</t2201> <t2202>These kids are like helium balloons tied down.</t2202> <t2203>They pull on the string over and over again, until finally the string breaks and they fly away.</t2203> <t2204>And maybe you'll never see that balloon again, because it lands in Canada or wherever, finds a job in a restaurant, and before the balloon realizes it, it's been thirty years in the same café serving coffee to the same sons of bitches.</t2204> <t2205>Or maybe in three or four years, or in three or four days, the prevailing winds bring the balloon back home, because it needs money, or because it has changed its mind, or because it misses its little brother.</t2205> <t2206>But, look, kid, the string keeps breaking.</t2206>
<t2207>—Yes, bu…</t2207>
<t2208>—I'm not finished, kid.</t2208> <t2209>The problem with these damn balloons is that there are so many of them.</t2209> <t2210>The sky is full of balloons flying from one side to the other and colliding with each other, and each and every one of these damn balloons ends up on my desk for one reason or another, and over time you get discouraged.</t2210> <t2211>Balloons everywhere, each one with a father or a mother, or if you're lucky, with both, and in the end, you can't even see them individually.</t2211> <t2212>You look up at the balloons in the sky and see them as a whole, but you no longer see them one by one.</t2212> <t2213>—He fell silent and took a deep breath, as if he had just realized something—.</t2213> <t2214>But every now and then you talk to a kid with big eyes and too much hair on his head, and you want to lie to him because he seems like a good kid.</t2214> <t2215>And you feel sorry for him, because the only thing worse than the sky full of balloons you see is what he sees: a clear blue day with a single balloon.</t2215> <t2216>But when the string breaks, kid, you can't glue it back together.</t2216> <t2217>Do you understand what I'm trying to tell you?</t2217>
<t2218>I nodded, although I wasn't sure I had understood.</t2218> <t2219>He stood up.</t2219>
<t2220>—I think he will return soon, boy.</t2220> <t2221>For what it's worth.</t2221>
<t2222>I liked the image of Margo as a balloon, but I thought that, in his desire to be poetic, the detective had seen me as much more worried than I actually was.</t2222> <t2223>I knew she would come back.</t2223> <t2224>She would deflate and fly back to Jefferson Park.</t2224> <t2225>She had always come back.</t2225>
<t2226>I returned to the dining room with the detective, who said he wanted to go back to the Spiegelman house to take a look in Margo's room.</t2226> <t2227>Mrs. Spiegelman hugged me.</t2227>
<t2228>"You have always been a good boy," he told me.</t2228> <t2229>"I'm sorry that you have to get mixed up in these ridiculous things."</t2229>
<t2230>Mr. Spiegelman shook my hand and they left.</t2230> <t2231>As soon as the door was closed, my father said:</t2231>
<t2232>—Wow.</t2232>
<t2233>—Wow —confirmed my mother.</t2233>
<t2234>My father put his arm around my shoulders.</t2234>
<t2235>—They have opted for a dynamic that only creates problems, haven't they?</t2235>
<t2236>—They are idiots —I told him.</t2236>
<t2237>My parents liked it when I said swear words in front of them.</t2237> <t2238>I saw the pleasure on their faces.</t2238> <t2239>It meant that I trusted them, that I was myself in front of them.</t2239> <t2240>But, even so, they seemed sad.</t2240>
<t2241>—Margo's parents suffer a serious blow to their narcissism every time their daughter misbehaves —my father told me.</t2241>
<t2242>—And that prevents them from behaving as effective parents —added my mother.</t2242>
<t2243>—They are idiots —I repeated.</t2243>
<t2244>—To be honest —said my father—, they are probably right.</t2244> <t2245>Margo probably needs attention.</t2245> <t2246>And God knows I would need attention too if those two were my parents.</t2246>
<t2247>—When she comes back, she will be devastated —commented my mother—.</t2247> <t2248>To be abandoned like that…</t2248> <t2249>Rejected when you need affection the most.</t2249>
<t2250>—Maybe I could live here when I come back —I said.</t2250>
<t2251>And when I said it, I realized that it was an absolutely brilliant idea.</t2251> <t2252>My mother's eyes also sparkled, but then she saw something in my father's expression and replied to me with her usual restraint.</t2252>
<t2253>—Well, it would certainly be welcome, although it would have its inconveniences…: living next to the Spiegelmans.</t2253> <t2254>But when she returns to the institute, please tell her that she is welcome here, and if she doesn't want to stay with us, there are many other solutions we would love to discuss with her.</t2254>
<t2255>At that moment, Ben appeared with his hair so tangled that it seemed to defy our basic understanding of the effect of gravity on matter.</t2255>
<t2256>—Mr. and Mrs. Jacobsen, delighted to see you, as always.</t2256>
<t2257>—Good morning, Ben.</t2257> <t2258>I didn't know you had stayed the night.</t2258>
<t2259>—The truth is that I don't either —said Ben—.</t2259> <t2260>Is something wrong?</t2260>
<t2261>I told Ben about the detective, the Spiegelmans, and Margo, who was technically a missing adult.</t2261> <t2262>When I finished, he nodded and said:</t2262>
<t2263>—Surely we would have to discuss it over a steaming plate of Resurrection.</t2263>
<t2264>I smiled and went back with him to my room.</t2264> <t2265>Radar came by my house shortly after, and as soon as he arrived, they kicked me off the team because we were facing a difficult mission and, although I was the only one of the three who had the game, I wasn't very good at Resurrection.</t2265> <t2266>I was watching them advance through a space station crowded with demons when Ben said:</t2266>
<t2267>—A goblin, Radar, a goblin.</t2267>
<t2268>—I see it now.</t2268>
<t2269>—Come here, son of a bitch —said Ben, turning the controls—.</t2269> <t2270>Daddy is going to put you on a boat to cross the River Styx.</t2270>
<t2271>—Did you just resort to Greek mythology to show off? —I asked him.</t2271>
<t2272>Radar laughed.</t2272> <t2273>Ben started pounding buttons and shouting.</t2273>
<t2274>—Eat that, elf! Eat it like Zeus ate Metis!</t2274>
<t2275>—I would say she will be back on Monday —I commented—.</t2275> <t2276>Not even Margo Roth Spiegelman is interested in missing too many classes.</t2276> <t2277>Maybe she will stay here until graduation.</t2277>
<t2278>Radar answered me as anyone would who was playing Resurrection, incoherently.</t2278>
<t2279>—I still don't understand why she left, just because demon in front not uncle with the ray gun has been left without a boyfriend?</t2279> <t2280>I thought she was more where is the cave to the left immune to these things.</t2280>
<t2281>—No —I said to him—, it wasn't that, I don't think.</t2281> <t2282>Or not just that.</t2282> <t2283>He hates Orlando.</t2283> <t2284>He said it's a paper town.</t2284> <t2285>You know, everything so fake and insubstantial.</t2285> <t2286>I think he simply wanted to take a vacation.</t2286>
<t2287>Then I glanced out the window and immediately saw that someone —I assumed it was the detective— had lowered the blind in Margo's room.</t2287> <t2288>But the blind was not visible.</t2288> <t2289>What was visible was a black and white poster stuck to the outside of the blind.</t2289> <t2290>It was a photograph of a man, with slightly slumped shoulders, looking straight ahead.</t2290> <t2291>He had a cigarette between his lips and a guitar hanging from his shoulder with a phrase painted on it: THIS MACHINE KILLS FASCISTS.</t2291>
<t2292>—There is something at Margo's window.</t2292>
<t2293>The game's music stopped, and Radar and Ben approached me and knelt down on either side.</t2293>
<t2294>—Is it new? —Radar asked me.</t2294>
<t2295>—I have seen that shutter from the outside millions of times, but I had never seen that poster —I replied.</t2295>
<t2296>—How strange —said Ben.</t2296>
<t2297>—Margo's parents said this morning that sometimes she leaves clues —I said—.</t2297> <t2298>But never anything concrete enough to find her before she comes back home.</t2298>
<t2299>Radar had already taken out his pocket computer and was looking up the phrase in the Omnictionary.</t2299>
<t2300>—The photo is of Woody Guthrie —he commented—.</t2300> <t2301>Folk singer, 1912-1967.</t2301> <t2302>All his lyrics spoke about the working class.</t2302> <t2303>«This Land Is Your Land».</t2303> <t2304>Leaning towards communist.</t2304> <t2305>Inspired Bob Dylan.</t2305>
<t2306>Radar reproduced a snippet of one of his songs, a high-pitched and squeaky voice singing about unions.</t2306>
<t2307>—I will send an email to the guy who has written almost all of this page to see if there is any connection between Woody Guthrie and Margo —said Radar.</t2307>
<t2308>—I find it hard to imagine that he likes his songs —I added.</t2308>
<t2309>—True —admitted Ben—.</t2309> <t2310>This guy looks like an alcoholic Kermit the Frog with throat cancer.</t2310>
<t2311>Radar opened the window, stuck his head out, and looked in all directions.</t2311>
<t2312>—Well, it looks like he left the clue for you, Q. Wow, do you know anyone else who can see that window?</t2312>
<t2313>I shook my head.</t2313>
<t2314>After a while, Ben added:</t2314>
<t2315>—He looks at us in a way...</t2315> <t2316>As if saying: "Pay attention to me."</t2316> <t2317>And his head like this...</t2317> <t2318>It doesn't seem like he's on a stage.</t2318> <t2319>It seems like he's at a door or something like that.</t2319>
<t2320>—I think he wants us to go in —I said.</t2320>
<t2321>4</t2321>
<t2322>From my room, you couldn't see the front door or the garage.</t2322> <t2323>To see them, we had to go to the living room.</t2323> <t2324>So, while Ben kept playing Resurrection, Radar and I went to the living room and pretended to watch TV while keeping an eye on the Spiegelmans' door through a large window, waiting for Margo's parents to leave.</t2324> <t2325>Detective Warren's black Crown Victoria was still parked in front of the house.</t2325>
<t2326>He left about fifteen minutes later, but during the next hour, neither the front door nor the garage door opened again.</t2326> <t2327>Radar and I were watching a somewhat funny stoner comedy on HBO, and I had started to get into the story when Radar said:</t2327>
<t2328>—The garage door.</t2328>
<t2329>I jumped off the couch and approached the window to see who was in the car.</t2329> <t2330>Mr. and Mrs. Spiegelman.</t2330> <t2331>Ruthie had stayed at home.</t2331>
<t2332>—Ben! —I shouted.</t2332>
<t2333>He shot out like an arrow.</t2333> <t2334>While the Spiegelmans turned onto Jefferson Way to get onto Jefferson Road, we ran out into the damp morning.</t2334>
<t2335>We crossed the Spiegelmans' lawn to the door.</t2335> <t2336>I rang the doorbell, heard Myrna Mountweazel's paws running on the wooden floor, and then she started barking like crazy, looking at us through the side glass.</t2336> <t2337>Ruthie opened the door.</t2337> <t2338>She was a very sweet girl of about eleven years old.</t2338>
<t2339>—Hello, Ruthie.</t2339>
<t2340>—Hello, Quentin —he/she replied to me.</t2340>
<t2341>—Are your parents at home?</t2341>
<t2342>—They just left —he told me—.</t2342> <t2343>To Target.</t2343> <t2344>—She had Margo's big eyes, but brown.</t2344> <t2345>She looked at me and pursed her lips worriedly—.</t2345> <t2346>Have you seen the police officer?</t2346>
<t2347>—Yes —I replied—.</t2347> <t2348>He seemed kind.</t2348>
<t2349>—My mother says it's as if Margo had gone to college earlier.</t2349>
<t2350>—Yes —I told him.</t2350>
<t2351>I thought that the best way to solve a mystery was to conclude that there was no mystery to solve.</t2351> <t2352>But by that point, it was clear to me that Margo had left behind the clues of a mystery.</t2352>
<t2353>—Hey, Ruthie, we need to take a look at Margo's room —I said—.</t2353> <t2354>But the thing is…</t2354> <t2355>It's like when Margo asked you to do something in secret.</t2355> <t2356>The situation is the same.</t2356>
<t2357>—Margo doesn't like people entering her room —Ruthie answered me—.</t2357> <t2358>Except for me.</t2358> <t2359>And sometimes my mother.</t2359>
<t2360>—But we are his friends.</t2360>
<t2361>—He doesn't like his friends entering his room —insisted Ruthie.</t2361>
<t2362>I leaned towards her.</t2362>
<t2363>—Ruthie, please.</t2363>
<t2364>—And you don't want me to tell my parents.</t2364>
<t2365>—Exactly.</t2365>
<t2366>—Five dollars —he told me.</t2366>
<t2367>I was about to haggle over the price, but Radar took out a five-dollar bill and gave it to him.</t2367>
<t2368>—If I see the car in the driveway, I will let you know —he told us with a conspiratorial tone.</t2368>
<t2369>I knelt down to pet the old but always enthusiastic Myrna Mountweazel and then we ran up to Margo's room.</t2369> <t2370>As I placed my hand on the doorknob, it crossed my mind that I hadn't seen Margo's room since I was about ten years old.</t2370>
<t2371>I entered.</t2371> <t2372>It was cleaner than one would expect from Margo, but perhaps her mother had picked everything up.</t2372> <t2373>To my right, a closet overflowing with clothes.</t2373> <t2374>Behind the door, a shoe rack with a couple dozen pairs of shoes, ranging from Mary Janes to high heels.</t2374> <t2375>It didn't seem like too many things were missing.</t2375>
<t2376>—I'll get on the computer —said Radar.</t2376>
<t2377>Ben was fiddling with the blind.</t2377>
<t2378>—The poster is stuck —he observed—.</t2378> <t2379>Only with adhesive tape.</t2379> <t2380>Nothing strong.</t2380>
<t2381>The big surprise was on the wall next to the computer desk: shelves as tall as me and twice as wide, filled with vinyl records.</t2381> <t2382>Hundreds of records.</t2382>
<t2383>—On the turntable is A Love Supreme by John Coltrane —said Ben.</t2383>
<t2384>—Damn, it's an awesome album —said Radar without taking his eyes off the computer—.</t2384> <t2385>The girl has good taste.</t2385>
<t2386>I looked at Ben in confusion.</t2386>
<t2387>—He was a saxophonist —commented Ben.</t2387>
<t2388>I nodded.</t2388>
<t2389>—I can't believe that Q has never heard of Coltrane —said Radar without stopping typing—.</t2389> <t2390>His music is literally the most convincing proof of the existence of God that I have ever found.</t2390>
<t2391>I started looking at the records.</t2391> <t2392>They were arranged alphabetically by artists, so I went through them looking for G: Dizzy Gillespie, Jimmie Dale Gilmore, Green Day, Guided by Voices, George Harrison.</t2392>
<t2393>—He has all the musicians in the world except for Woody Guthrie —I said.</t2393>
<t2394>I went back and started with A.</t2394>
<t2395>—All his textbooks are here —I heard Ben say—.</t2395> <t2396>Plus some others on the nightstand.</t2396> <t2397>No diary.</t2397>
<t2398>But I was distracted by Margo's record collection.</t2398> <t2399>She liked everything.</t2399> <t2400>I never would have imagined her listening to all those old records.</t2400> <t2401>I had seen her listening to music while running, but I had never suspected that kind of obsession.</t2401> <t2402>I hadn't heard of most of the bands, and I was surprised to discover that even new bands were still releasing records on vinyl.</t2402>
<t2403>I kept moving through A, then through B —making my way between the Beatles, the Blind Boys of Alabama, and Blondie—, and I started to browse them faster, so fast that I didn't even notice the back cover of Mermaid Avenue by Billy Bragg until I was looking at the Buzzcocks.</t2403> <t2404>I stopped, went back, and took out the Billy Bragg record.</t2404> <t2405>The cover was a photograph of terraced houses in a city.</t2405> <t2406>But on the other side, Woody Guthrie was staring at me, with a cigarette between his lips and a guitar that said: THIS MACHINE KILLS FASCISTS.</t2406>
<t2407>—Hey! —I exclaimed.</t2407>
<t2408>Ben approached to look.</t2408>
<t2409>—Fucking awesome —he said—.</t2409> <t2410>Good job.</t2410>
<t2411>Radar turned the chair.</t2411>
<t2412>—Impressive.</t2412> <t2413>I wonder what's inside —he said.</t2413>
<t2414>Unfortunately, what was inside was just a record.</t2414> <t2415>And the record looked exactly like a record.</t2415> <t2416>I put it on Margo's turntable and eventually figured out how to turn it on and place the needle.</t2416> <t2417>It was a guy singing Woody Guthrie songs.</t2417> <t2418>He sang better than him.</t2418>
<t2419>—What is this? A mere coincidence?</t2419>
<t2420>Ben had the cover in his hands.</t2420>
<t2421>—Look —he said.</t2421>
<t2422>He was pointing at the list of songs.</t2422> <t2423>The title "Walt Whitman’s Niece" was circled with a black pen.</t2423>
<t2424>—Interesting —I murmured.</t2424>
<t2425>Margo's mother had said that Margo's clues never led anywhere, but now I knew that Margo had left a chain of clues, and everything seemed to indicate that she had left them for me.</t2425> <t2426>Immediately, I thought of her telling me in the SunTrust Building that I was better when I trusted myself.</t2426> <t2427>I turned the record over and played the song.</t2427> <t2428>"Walt Whitman’s Niece" was the first on side B.</t2428> <t2429>It wasn't bad, actually.</t2429>
<t2430>Then I saw Ruthie at the door.</t2430> <t2431>She looked at me.</t2431>
<t2432>—Can you give us a hint, Ruthie?</t2432>
<t2433>He shook his head.</t2433>
<t2434>—I have also searched —he replied to me with a sad tone.</t2434>
<t2435>Radar looked at me and then turned his head towards Ruthie.</t2435>
<t2436>—Can you watch out so your mother doesn't arrive, please? —I asked him.</t2436>
<t2437>He nodded and left.</t2437> <t2438>I closed the door.</t2438>
<t2439>—What's going on? —I asked Radar, who gestured for us to come closer to the computer.</t2439>
<t2440>—A week before leaving, Margo logged into Omnictionary a bunch of times.</t2440> <t2441>I know this from the minutes she was connected with her username, which has been saved in her passwords.</t2441> <t2442>But she deleted her browsing history, so I don't know what she was looking for.</t2442>
<t2443>"Hey, Radar, look up who Walt Whitman was," said Ben.</t2443>
<t2444>—He was a poet —I replied—.</t2444> <t2445>From the nineteenth century.</t2445>
<t2446>—Great —said Ben, looking at the ceiling—.</t2446> <t2447>Poetry.</t2447>
<t2448>—What's wrong with it? —I asked him.</t2448>
<t2449>—Poetry is so emo —he told me—.</t2449> <t2450>Oh, the pain.</t2450> <t2451>The pain.</t2451> <t2452>It always rains.</t2452> <t2453>In my heart.</t2453>
<t2454>—Yes, I think that's from Shakespeare —I replied disdainfully—.</t2454> <t2455>Did Walt Whitman have any nieces? —I asked Radar.</t2455>
<t2456>Radar had already entered the Walt Whitman page of the Omnictionary.</t2456> <t2457>A burly guy with a huge beard.</t2457> <t2458>He had never read him, but he looked like a good poet.</t2458>
<t2459>—Ugh, no famous ones.</t2459> <t2460>It says he had a couple of siblings, but not if any of them had children.</t2460> <t2461>I think I can find it if you want.</t2461>
<t2462>I shook my head.</t2462> <t2463>It didn't seem like the right path.</t2463> <t2464>I went back to searching the room.</t2464> <t2465>On the last shelf of the record collection, there were some books —school yearbooks from previous years, a battered copy of The Outsiders— and several back issues of youth magazines.</t2465> <t2466>Clearly nothing that had to do with Walt Whitman's niece.</t2466>
<t2467>I glanced at the books on her nightstand.</t2467> <t2468>Nothing interesting.</t2468>
<t2469>—The logical thing would be for him to have a book of Whitman's poems —I said—.</t2469> <t2470>But it seems that is not the case.</t2470>
<t2471>—He sure does! —exclaimed Ben enthusiastically.</t2471>
<t2472>I approached him, who had knelt in front of the shelves, and I saw him.</t2472> <t2473>I had overlooked the thin volume on the last shelf, tucked between two yearbooks.</t2473> <t2474>Walt Whitman.</t2474> <t2475>Leaves of Grass.</t2475> <t2476>I took out the book.</t2476> <t2477>On the cover was a photo of the poet, whose bright eyes stared at me intently.</t2477>
<t2478>—It wasn't bad —I said to Ben.</t2478>
<t2479>He nodded.</t2479>
<t2480>—Yes.</t2480> <t2481>Can we get out of here already?</t2481> <t2482>You can call me old-fashioned, but I would prefer not to be here when Margo's parents come back.</t2482>
<t2483>—Did we leave something behind?</t2483>
<t2484>Radar stood up.</t2484>
<t2485>—The truth is that it seems he has drawn a perfectly straight line.</t2485> <t2486>There must be something in that book.</t2486> <t2487>But it seems strange to me…</t2487> <t2488>Well, no offense, but if he has always left clues for his parents, why would he leave them for you this time?</t2488>
<t2489>I shrugged.</t2489> <t2490>I couldn't answer him, although of course I harbored hopes: maybe Margo wanted to see that I trusted myself.</t2490> <t2491>Maybe this time she wanted to be found, for me to find her.</t2491> <t2492>Maybe... just as she had chosen me for the longest night, she had chosen me again.</t2492> <t2493>And maybe incalculable riches awaited the one who found her.</t2493>
<t2494>Ben and Radar left shortly after we returned to my house, having looked through the book and found no obvious clues.</t2494> <t2495>I grabbed a piece of lasagna from the fridge and went up to my room with Walt.</t2495> <t2496>It was the Penguin Classics edition of the first edition of Leaves of Grass.</t2496> <t2497>I read part of the introduction and then skimmed through the book.</t2497> <t2498>There were several verses highlighted in blue fluorescent, all of them from the epically long poem titled "Song of Myself."</t2498> <t2499>And two verses highlighted in green:</t2499>
<t2500>Rip the locks off the doors!</t2500>
<t2501>Rip the doors off their hinges[1]!</t2501>
<t2502>I spent a good part of the afternoon trying to unravel the meaning of the quote, thinking that maybe Margo was trying to tell me to become a jerk or something like that.</t2502> <t2503>But I also read and reread what was marked in blue:</t2503>
<t2504>You will no longer receive things second or third hand, nor</t2504>
<t2505>you will look through the eyes of the dead, nor will you feed on the specters of books.</t2505>
<t2506>The journey I have undertaken is eternal</t2506>
<t2507>Everything progresses and expands, nothing falls apart,</t2507>
<t2508>and to die is something different from what many supposed, and of better omen.</t2508>
<t2509>If no one in the world knows it, I am satisfied,</t2509>
<t2510>if everyone knows it, I am satisfied.</t2510>
<t2511>The last three stanzas of "Song of Myself" were also highlighted with fluorescent marker.</t2511>
<t2512>Let the mud be my heir, I want to grow from the grass I love;</t2512>
<t2513>If you want to find me, look for me under the sole of your shoes.</t2513>
<t2514>You will barely understand who I am or what I want to say,</t2514>
<t2515>but I must give you good health, and to your blood, strength and purity.</t2515>
<t2516>If you don't find me at first, don't lose heart,</t2516>
<t2517>if I am not in one place, you will find me in another,</t2517>
<t2518>somewhere I wait for you.</t2518>
<t2519>I spent the weekend reading, trying to see her in the fragments of the poem she had left me.</t2519> <t2520>I wasn't getting anywhere with those lines, but I kept thinking about them because I didn't want to disappoint her.</t2520> <t2521>Margo wanted me to follow the thread, to find the place where she was waiting for me, to follow her trail until I reached her.</t2521>
<t2522>5</t2522>
<t2523>On Monday morning, an extraordinary event occurred.</t2523> <t2524>I was running late, which was normal, so my mother drove me to school, which was also normal.</t2524> <t2525>I stayed outside chatting for a while with everyone, which was normal, and then Ben and I went inside, which was also normal.</t2525> <t2526>But as soon as we pushed the steel door, Ben's face turned into a mix of nerves and panic, as if a magician had just chosen him to perform the trick of sawing him in half.</t2526> <t2527>I followed his gaze down the hallway.</t2527>
<t2528>Denim miniskirt.</t2528> <t2529>Tight white t-shirt.</t2529> <t2530>Generous neckline.</t2530> <t2531>Extraordinarily olive skin.</t2531> <t2532>Legs that sparked your interest in legs.</t2532> <t2533>Perfectly styled curly brown hair.</t2533> <t2534>A button that said VOTE ME FOR PROM QUEEN.</t2534> <t2535>Lacey Pemberton.</t2535> <t2536>Approaching us by the rehearsal room.</t2536>
<t2537>—Lacey Pemberton —whispered Ben, even though the girl was about three steps away from us and could perfectly hear him.</t2537> <t2538>And, in fact, she flashed a falsely shy smile upon hearing her name.</t2538>
<t2539>—Quentin —he said to me.</t2539>
<t2540>What seemed most incredible to me was that she knew my name.</t2540> <t2541>She made a gesture with her head and I crossed the rehearsal room behind her until we reached a block of lockers.</t2541> <t2542>Ben stayed by my side.</t2542>
<t2543>—Hello, Lacey —I greeted when she stopped.</t2543>
<t2544>As her perfume reached me, I remembered that smell in her SUV and the crunch of the catfish while Margo and I lowered the seat.</t2544>
<t2545>—They told me you were with Margo.</t2545>
<t2546>I limited myself to looking at her.</t2546>
<t2547>—The other night, with the fish.</t2547> <t2548>In my car.</t2548> <t2549>And in Becca's closet.</t2549> <t2550>And at Jase's window.</t2550>
<t2551>I kept looking at her.</t2551> <t2552>I didn't know what to say.</t2552> <t2553>One can have a long and adventurous life without Lacey Pemberton ever having spoken a word to them, but when that rare occasion arises, one does not want to say the wrong thing.</t2553> <t2554>So Ben spoke for me.</t2554>
<t2555>—Yes, they went out together —said Ben, as if Margo and I were close.</t2555>
<t2556>—Was she angry with me? —asked Lacey a little later.</t2556>
<t2557>She was looking at the ground.</t2557> <t2558>I saw her brown eye shadow.</t2558>
<t2559>—What?</t2559>
<t2560>Then she spoke very slowly, with a slightly broken voice, and suddenly Lacey Pemberton was no longer Lacey Pemberton.</t2560> <t2561>She was just... a person.</t2561>
<t2562>—You know, if she was mad at me for something.</t2562>
<t2563>I thought for a second about what to answer.</t2563>
<t2564>—Well, she was a bit disappointed because you hadn't told her about Jase and Becca, but you know Margo.</t2564> <t2565>She'll get over it.</t2565>
<t2566>Lacey started walking down the hallway.</t2566> <t2567>Ben and I let her go, but suddenly she slowed down.</t2567> <t2568>She wanted us to go with her.</t2568> <t2569>Ben gave me a little push and we started walking together.</t2569>
<t2570>—The problem is that I didn't even know about Jase and Becca —said Lacey—.</t2570> <t2571>I hope I can explain it to her soon.</t2571> <t2572>For a moment I was worried that she really wanted to leave, but then I opened her locker, because I know her combination, and all her photos and everything else are still there, the books too.</t2572>
<t2573>—Good sign —I replied to him.</t2573>
<t2574>—Yes, but it's already been four days.</t2574> <t2575>It's almost a record for her.</t2575> <t2576>And well, it's crap, because Craig knew it, and I got so mad because he didn't tell me that I broke up with him, and now I don't have a date for the dance, and my best friend has taken off who knows where, to New York or some other place, thinking I did something I would NEVER do.</t2576>
<t2577>I glanced at Ben, and Ben glanced at me.</t2577>
<t2578>—I have to run to class —I told him—.</t2578> <t2579>Why did you say he is in New York?</t2579>
<t2580>—I think two days before leaving, he told Jase that New York was the only place in the country where one could live a halfway decent life.</t2580> <t2581>Maybe he said it just to say something.</t2581> <t2582>I don't know.</t2582>
<t2583>—Okay, I'm running off —I told him.</t2583>
<t2584>I knew that Ben would never convince Lacey to go to the dance with him, but I thought he at least deserved a chance.</t2584> <t2585>I ran through the hallways to my locker and as I passed by Radar, I gave him a tap on the head.</t2585> <t2586>Radar was talking to Angela and a freshman from the band.</t2586>
<t2587>—Don't thank me.</t2587> <t2588>Thank Q —I heard him say to the first-year girl.</t2588>
<t2589>—Thank you for the two hundred dollars! —the girl said to me.</t2589>
<t2590>—Don't thank me, thank Margo Roth Spiegelman! —I shouted without turning my head.</t2590>
<t2591>Because it was clear that Margo was the one who had provided me with the necessary tools.</t2591>
<t2592>I opened the locker and grabbed the calculus notebook, but then I stood still, even though the second bell had already rung, motionless in the middle of the hallway while people ran past me in both directions, as if I were the median of their highway.</t2592> <t2593>Another boy thanked me for the two hundred dollars.</t2593> <t2594>I smiled at him.</t2594> <t2595>The high school felt more like mine than it had in the four years I had been there.</t2595> <t2596>We had done justice for the band geeks who had lost their bicycles.</t2596> <t2597>Lacey Pemberton had talked to me.</t2597> <t2598>Chuck Parson had apologized.</t2598>
<t2599>I knew those hallways very well, and in the end, it started to seem like they knew me too.</t2599> <t2600>I stood there while the third bell rang and the crowd dispersed.</t2600> <t2601>Only then did I head to calculus class and sit down just after Mr. Jiminez had started another of his endless lessons.</t2601>
<t2602>I had taken Margo's copy of Leaves of Grass to class, so I opened it under the table and started reading the marked passages from "Song of Myself" again while Mr. Jiminez wrote on the board.</t2602> <t2603>I didn't see any direct references to New York.</t2603> <t2604>A few minutes later, I passed the book to Radar, who flipped through it for a while and then wrote in the corner of his notebook: "The green highlighting must mean something.</t2604> <t2605>Maybe it wants you to open the door of your mind."</t2605> <t2606>I shrugged and wrote back: "Or maybe she just read the poem on two different days with two different highlighters."</t2606>
<t2607>A few minutes later, after looking at the clock for only the thirty-seventh time, I saw Ben Starling on the other side of the classroom door, doing a jerky dance and holding a hall pass in his hand.</t2607>
<t2608>When the lunch bell rang, I ran to my locker, but Ben had managed to get there before me and was talking to Lacey Pemberton.</t2608> <t2609>He was leaning in towards her, slightly hunched to speak to her face to face.</t2609> <t2610>Talking to Ben sometimes felt a bit claustrophobic, and that was even though I wasn't a hot girl.</t2610>
<t2611>—Hello, guys —I said to them upon arriving.</t2611>
<t2612>—Hello —Lacey replied, taking a step back to move away from Ben—.</t2612> <t2613>Ben was telling me the latest news about Margo.</t2613> <t2614>No one ever went into her room, you know.</t2614> <t2615>She said that her parents didn't allow her friends to come over.</t2615>
<t2616>—Really?</t2616>
<t2617>Lacey nodded.</t2617>
<t2618>—Did you know that Margo has about a thousand records? —I asked her.</t2618>
<t2619>Lacey raised her hands.</t2619>
<t2620>—No.</t2620> <t2621>That’s what Ben was telling me.</t2621> <t2622>Margo never talked about music.</t2622> <t2623>Well, she would say she liked a song that was playing on the radio and things like that.</t2623> <t2624>But… no.</t2624> <t2625>She’s very strange.</t2625>
<t2626>I shrugged.</t2626> <t2627>Maybe she was strange, or maybe the strange ones were the rest of us.</t2627> <t2628>Lacey kept talking.</t2628>
<t2629>—But we were saying that Walt Whitman was from New York.</t2629>
<t2630>—And according to the Omnictionary, Woody Guthrie also lived in New York for a long time —said Ben.</t2630>
<t2631>I nodded.</t2631>
<t2632>—I can perfectly imagine her in New York.</t2632> <t2633>But I think we need to discover the next clue.</t2633> <t2634>It can't be just the book.</t2634> <t2635>There must be some kind of code in the marked verses or something like that.</t2635>
<t2636>—Yes.</t2636> <t2637>Can I take a look while I eat?</t2637>
<t2638>—Sure —I replied—.</t2638> <t2639>Or if you want, I can make photocopies for you at the library.</t2639>
<t2640>—No need.</t2640> <t2641>I just want to read it.</t2641> <t2642>Wow, I don't understand a damn thing about poetry.</t2642> <t2643>But a cousin of mine goes to New York University, and I sent her a poster to print.</t2643> <t2644>I'm going to ask her to hang it in record stores.</t2644> <t2645>Well, I know there are a lot of record stores, but anyway.</t2645>
<t2646>—Good idea —I told him.</t2646>
<t2647>They headed to the cafeteria and I followed them.</t2647>
<t2648>—Hey —asked Ben to Lacey—, what color is your dress?</t2648>
<t2649>—Hmm, except for the sapphire blue.</t2649> <t2650>Why?</t2650>
<t2651>—To make sure it matches my tuxedo —Ben replied.</t2651>
<t2652>I had never seen such a ridiculous and silly smile on Ben, and that's saying something, because he was quite a ridiculous and silly person.</t2652>
<t2653>Lacey nodded.</t2653>
<t2654>—Well, but let's not go too coordinated either.</t2654> <t2655>You could go traditional, with a black tuxedo and a black vest.</t2655>
<t2656>—Without a girdle, what do you think?</t2656>
<t2657>—Well, the sashes are fine, but without too many folds, you know?</t2657>
<t2658>They kept talking —apparently, the ideal level of folds is a topic of conversation to which they can dedicate hours—, but I stopped listening while I waited in line at Pizza Hut.</t2658> <t2659>Ben had found a partner for the dance, and Lacey had found a guy who could spend hours talking about the dance, enchanted by life.</t2659> <t2660>Now everyone had a partner… except me, who wasn't going to go.</t2660> <t2661>The only girl I would have liked to take had embarked on an eternal journey.</t2661>
<t2662>When we sat down, Lacey started to read "Song of Myself" and agreed that it didn't sound like anything, and certainly didn't sound like Margo.</t2662> <t2663>We still had no idea what Margo was trying to say, if she was trying to say anything at all.</t2663> <t2664>She handed the book back to me and they started talking about the dance again.</t2664>
<t2665>All afternoon I had the feeling that I wasn't on the right track searching through the marked quotes, but in the end, I got bored, took the book out of my backpack, put it on my knees, and continued with it.</t2665> <t2666>The last class was literature and we were starting to read Moby Dick, so Dr. Holden kept talking about fishing in the 19th century.</t2666> <t2667>I left Moby Dick on the table and Whitman on my knees, but even being in literature class didn't help.</t2667> <t2668>For once, I didn't look at the clock for several minutes, so the bell surprised me and I took longer than the others to gather my things.</t2668> <t2669>As I slung my backpack over one shoulder and started to leave, Dr. Holden smiled at me.</t2669>
<t2670>—Walt Whitman, eh? —he asked me.</t2670>
<t2671>I nodded, embarrassed.</t2671>
<t2672>—It's very good —he told me—.</t2672> <t2673>So good that I'm almost in agreement for you to read it in class.</t2673> <t2674>But not entirely.</t2674>
<t2675>I murmured an apology and headed to the senior student parking lot.</t2675>
<t2676>While Ben and Radar were rehearsing, I sat in the Chuco with the doors open.</t2676> <t2677>A light Eskimo breeze was blowing.</t2677> <t2678>I read the Federalist to prepare for a politics exam I had the next day, but my mind had entered a loop: Guthrie, Whitman, New York, and Margo.</t2678> <t2679>Had she gone to New York to dive into folk music?</t2679> <t2680>Was there some secret folk musician there that I didn't know about?</t2680> <t2681>Was she perhaps in an apartment where one of them had once lived?</t2681> <t2682>And why did she want me to know?</t2682>
<t2683>I saw Ben and Radar approaching through the side mirror, Radar swinging his sax case as he hurried towards the RHAPAW.</t2683> <t2684>They got in, Ben turned the key, and the RHAPAW sputtered.</t2684> <t2685>We waited a moment and the car sputtered again.</t2685> <t2686>We kept waiting and finally it responded.</t2686> <t2687>Ben drove out of the parking lot and off the campus.</t2687>
<t2688>—CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS SHIT? —he shouted, unable to contain his joy.</t2688>
<t2689>He started honking the horn, but of course it didn't work, so every time he honked, he shouted: BEEP! BEEP! BEEP!</t2689> <t2690>HONK IF YOU'RE GOING TO THE DANCE WITH A TURKEY, WITH LACEY PEMBERTON!</t2690> <t2691>HONK, BABY, HONK!</t2691>
<t2692>He could barely keep his mouth shut on the way home.</t2692>
<t2693>—Do you know why she accepted?</t2693> <t2694>Apart from being desperate?</t2694> <t2695>I think she had a fight with Becca Arrington, because you know, Becca deceived her, and I think she was starting to feel bad about the whole Bloody Ben thing.</t2695> <t2696>She didn't tell me, but it seemed like it.</t2696> <t2697>So in the end, I'll have some drama thanks to Bloody Ben.</t2697>
<t2698>I was happy for him, of course, but I wanted to focus on how to reach Margo.</t2698>
<t2699>—Guys, has any idea occurred to you?</t2699>
<t2700>For a moment there was no response, but then Radar looked at me through the rearview mirror and said:</t2700>
<t2701>—The thing about the doors is the only thing marked in a different color from the rest, and it's also the most unexpected.</t2701> <t2702>I think the clue is there.</t2702> <t2703>What did it say?</t2703>
<t2704>—"Tear the bolts from the doors! / Tear the doors from their hinges!" I replied.</t2704>
<t2705>—You have to admit that Jefferson Park is not the best place to unhinge the doors of the narrow-minded —said Radar—.</t2705> <t2706>Maybe that's what he means.</t2706> <t2707>Like what he said about Orlando being a paper town.</t2707> <t2708>Maybe what he means is that's why he left.</t2708>
<t2709>Ben stopped at a traffic light and turned to look at Radar.</t2709>
<t2710>—Colleague —he said—, I think you are giving that girl too much credit.</t2710>
<t2711>—What do you mean? —I asked him.</t2711>
<t2712>—"Tear the bolts off the doors," he commented—.</t2712> <t2713>"Tear the doors off the hinges."</t2713>
<t2714>—Yes —I said.</t2714>
<t2715>The traffic light turned green and Ben stepped on the accelerator.</t2715> <t2716>The Chuco trembled as if it were about to disintegrate, but it started to move.</t2716>
<t2717>—It is not poetry.</t2717> <t2718>It is not a metaphor.</t2718> <t2719>They are instructions.</t2719> <t2720>We are supposed to go to Margo's room, break the lock off the door, and take the door off its hinges.</t2720>
<t2721>Radar looked at me through the rearview mirror and I returned his gaze.</t2721>
<t2722>—He's so crazy that sometimes he ends up being a genius —Radar told me.</t2722>
<t2723>6</t2723>
<t2724>We parked in front of my house and crossed the strip of grass that separates Margo's house from mine, just as we had done on Saturday.</t2724> <t2725>Ruthie opened the door and told us that her parents wouldn't be home until six.</t2725> <t2726>Myrna Mountweazel, nervous, circled around us.</t2726> <t2727>We went upstairs.</t2727> <t2728>Ruthie brought us a toolbox from the garage, and for a moment we all stood staring at the door to Margo's room.</t2728> <t2729>We weren't very handy.</t2729>
<t2730>—What the hell are you supposed to do? —asked Ben.</t2730>
<t2731>—Don't talk like that in front of Ruthie —I told him.</t2731>
<t2732>—Ruthie, do you mind if I say damn?</t2732>
<t2733>—We don't believe in the devil —the girl replied to him.</t2733>
<t2734>Radar interrupted.</t2734>
<t2735>—Uncles —he said—.</t2735> <t2736>Uncles, the door.</t2736>
<t2737>Radar took a screwdriver from the pile of tools, knelt down, and unscrewed the door handle.</t2737> <t2738>I grabbed a larger screwdriver and tried to unscrew the hinges, but there didn't seem to be any screws, so I set about looking for them.</t2738> <t2739>In the end, Ruthie got bored and went to watch TV.</t2739>
<t2740>Radar took out the knob, and one by one we took a look at the unpainted and unpolished hole.</t2740> <t2741>No message.</t2741> <t2742>No note.</t2742> <t2743>Nothing.</t2743> <t2744>Angry, I looked again at the hinges, wondering how to open them.</t2744> <t2745>I opened and closed the door, trying to understand the mechanism.</t2745>
<t2746>—The poem is fucking long —I said—.</t2746> <t2747>Do you think old Walt resorted to a verse or two to tell us how to rip the door off its hinges?</t2747>
<t2748>I didn't realize that Radar was sitting in front of Margo's computer until he answered me.</t2748>
<t2749>—According to the Omnictionary, we are looking for a hinge.</t2749> <t2750>And the screwdriver is used as a lever to lift the nail.</t2750> <t2751>By the way, some prankster has posted that hinges work well because they are propelled by farts.</t2751> <t2752>Oh, Omnictionary, will you ever be accurate?</t2752>
<t2753>Once the Omnictionary had explained to us what to do, it turned out to be surprisingly easy.</t2753> <t2754>I took the nail out of each of the three hinges, and Ben removed the door.</t2754> <t2755>I inspected the hinges and the rough pieces of wood from the frame.</t2755> <t2756>Nothing.</t2756>
<t2757>—There is nothing at the door —said Ben.</t2757>
<t2758>We put the door back in place and Ben pushed the nails in with the handle of the screwdriver.</t2758>
<t2759>Radar and I went to Ben's house, which was architecturally identical to mine, to play a video game called Arctic Fury.</t2759> <t2760>We played that game within the game where you shot others with paintballs on a glacier.</t2760> <t2761>You got extra points for shooting your enemies in the balls.</t2761> <t2762>It was very sophisticated.</t2762>
<t2763>—Colleague, he is in New York, for sure —said Ben.</t2763>
<t2764>I saw the muzzle of his rifle behind a corner, but before I could move, he shot me between the legs.</t2764>
<t2765>—Shit —I murmured.</t2765>
<t2766>—It seems that other times her clues pointed to a place.</t2766> <t2767>She tells Jase and leaves us clues about two people who lived in New York for most of their lives —said Radar—.</t2767> <t2768>It makes sense.</t2768>
<t2769>—Colleague, that's what he wants —observed Ben.</t2769>
<t2770>Just as I was stealthily approaching Ben, he stopped the game.</t2770>
<t2771>—He wants you to go to New York —Ben continued saying—.</t2771> <t2772>What if he has arranged everything so that it's the only way to find her?</t2772> <t2773>That you go.</t2773>
<t2774>—What do you mean, what's happening?</t2774> <t2775>It's a city of twelve million people.</t2775>
<t2776>—I might have a spy here —said Radar—.</t2776> <t2777>If you go, who will tell him?</t2777>
<t2778>—Lacey! —exclaimed Ben—.</t2778> <t2779>It's definitely Lacey.</t2779> <t2780>Yes!</t2780> <t2781>You have to get on a plane and fly to New York right now.</t2781> <t2782>And when Lacey finds out, Margo will go to the airport to pick you up.</t2782> <t2783>Yes.</t2783> <t2784>Buddy, I'm going to take you to your house, you'll pack your bag, I'll drive you to the airport, you'll buy a ticket with your emergency-only credit card, and then, when Margo finds out how freaking awesome you are, so awesome that Jase Worthington couldn't even dream of comparing to you, the three of us will go to the dance with hot chicks.</t2784>
<t2785>He had no doubt that in the next few hours there would be a flight to New York.</t2785> <t2786>From Orlando, there are flights everywhere at all hours.</t2786> <t2787>But he doubted everything else.</t2787>
<t2788>—What if you call Lacey? —I asked her.</t2788>
<t2789>—He won't confess! —Ben replied to me—.</t2789> <t2790>Think about everything they've done to mislead.</t2790> <t2791>They probably pretended to have fought so you wouldn't suspect that Lacey was the spy.</t2791>
<t2792>—I don't know —said Radar—, the truth is that it doesn't seem consistent.</t2792>
<t2793>He kept talking, but I only half-listened.</t2793> <t2794>I was staring at the frozen screen and thinking.</t2794> <t2795>If Margo and Lacey had pretended to fight.</t2795> <t2796>Had Lacey pretended to break up with her boyfriend?</t2796> <t2797>Had she pretended to be worried?</t2797> <t2798>Lacey had responded to dozens of emails —none with real information— from the posters her cousin had put up in record stores in New York.</t2798> <t2799>She wasn't a spy.</t2799> <t2800>Ben's plan was idiotic.</t2800> <t2801>However, I was attracted to the mere idea of having a plan, even though there were only two and a half weeks left until classes ended, and if I went to New York, I would lose at least two days, not to mention that my parents would kill me for buying a plane ticket with the credit card.</t2801> <t2802>The more I thought about it, the more absurd it seemed to me.</t2802> <t2803>Although if I could see her tomorrow...</t2803> <t2804>But no.</t2804>
<t2805>—I can't miss class —I finally said.</t2805> <t2806>I unpaused the game—.</t2806> <t2807>Tomorrow I have a French exam.</t2807>
<t2808>—You know? —asked Ben—.</t2808> <t2809>Your romanticism is quite an inspiration.</t2809>
<t2810>I played for a while longer and then crossed Jefferson Park back home.</t2810>
<t2811>My mother once told me about a crazy boy she worked with.</t2811> <t2812>He had been a completely normal boy until he was nine years old, when his father died.</t2812> <t2813>And although it is evident that a lot of nine-year-old children lose their fathers, and most do not go crazy, I suppose that boy was an exception.</t2813>
<t2814>What the boy did was take a pencil and a compass, and start drawing circles on a sheet of paper.</t2814> <t2815>All the circles were exactly five centimeters in diameter.</t2815> <t2816>And he drew circles until the entire sheet of paper was completely black.</t2816> <t2817>Then he would take another sheet and draw more circles.</t2817> <t2818>And he did this every day, all the time.</t2818> <t2819>He didn't pay attention in class, he drew circles on all the exams, and my mother told me that the boy's problem was that he had created a routine to cope with his loss, but the routine had become destructive.</t2819> <t2820>The fact is that my mother managed to make him cry for his father, and the boy stopped drawing circles and apparently lived happily ever since.</t2820> <t2821>But every now and then I think about the boy with the circles, because in some way I understand him.</t2821> <t2822>I've always liked routines.</t2822> <t2823>I suppose that being bored never really bored me too much.</t2823> <t2824>I figured I couldn't explain it to someone like Margo, but spending your life drawing circles seemed like a somewhat reasonable madness to me.</t2824>
<t2825>So I should have felt good about not going to New York.</t2825> <t2826>In any case, it was idiotic.</t2826> <t2827>But that night, when I returned to my routine, and the next day, in class, I felt like it was eating me up inside, as if the routine itself was preventing me from meeting Margo.</t2827>
<t2828>7</t2828>
<t2829>On Tuesday afternoon, when it had been six days since Margo had left, I talked to my parents.</t2829> <t2830>It wasn't about having made a big decision or anything like that.</t2830> <t2831>I simply talked.</t2831> <t2832>I was sitting at the kitchen counter while my father chopped vegetables and my mother sautéed meat in a pan.</t2832> <t2833>My father was teasing me, asking how long it was going to take me to read such a short book.</t2833>
<t2834>—The truth is that it's not for literature —I told him—.</t2834> <t2835>It seems that Margo left it for him to find.</t2835>
<t2836>They both remained silent, and then I told them about Woody Guthrie and Whitman.</t2836>
<t2837>—It's clear that he likes to play these games of not giving all the information —observed my father.</t2837>
<t2838>—I don't blame her for wanting attention —said my mother, and then added, addressing me—:</t2838> <t2839>But that doesn't make you responsible for her well-being.</t2839>
<t2840>My father threw the carrots and onions into the pan.</t2840>
<t2841>—Yes, it's true.</t2841> <t2842>Neither of us can diagnose her without having seen her, although I suspect she will be home soon.</t2842>
<t2843>—We shouldn't speculate —my mother said to him in a low voice, as if I weren't listening.</t2843>
<t2844>My father was about to reply, but I interrupted him.</t2844>
<t2845>—What should I do?</t2845>
<t2846>—Graduate —my mother answered me—.</t2846> <t2847>And trust that Margo can take care of herself.</t2847> <t2848>She has already shown great talent.</t2848>
<t2849>—I agree —said my father.</t2849>
<t2850>But after dinner, when I returned to my room and played Resurrection without sound, I heard them talking about the matter in low voices.</t2850> <t2851>I couldn't hear what they were saying, but I could tell they were worried.</t2851>
<t2852>That same night, a little while later, Ben called me on my cell phone.</t2852>
<t2853>—Hello —I said to him.</t2853>
<t2854>—Colleague —he said to me.</t2854>
<t2855>—Tell me —I replied to him.</t2855>
<t2856>—I'm going to buy shoes with Lacey.</t2856>
<t2857>—To buy shoes?</t2857>
<t2858>—Yes.</t2858> <t2859>From ten to twelve at night, they offer a thirty percent discount.</t2859> <t2860>She wants me to help her choose the shoes for the dance.</t2860> <t2861>Well, she had bought some, but I went by her house yesterday and we agreed that they weren't... you know, she wants the perfect shoes for the occasion.</t2861> <t2862>So she's going to return them and then we'll go to Burdines and...</t2862>
<t2863>—Ben —I interrupted him.</t2863>
<t2864>—Tell me.</t2864>
<t2865>—Uncle, I don't feel like talking about Lacey's shoes for the dance.</t2865> <t2866>And I'll tell you why: I have something that prevents me from being interested in shoes for dances.</t2866> <t2867>It's called a dick.</t2867>
<t2868>—I am very nervous and I can't stop thinking that I actually like her, not just to go with her to the prom, but I think she's a really nice girl and I like going out with her.</t2868> <t2869>And maybe we'll go to the prom and we'll kiss in the middle of the dance floor and everything will be, damn, you know, everything they've thought about me will be gone with the wind...</t2869>
<t2870>—Ben —I said to him—, stop talking nonsense and everything will be fine.</t2870>
<t2871>He kept talking for a while longer, but in the end, I got rid of him.</t2871>
<t2872>I lay down and started to get depressed about the dance.</t2872> <t2873>I refused to feel the slightest bit of sadness about not going, but —stupidly and annoyingly— I had thought about finding Margo, bringing her home with me just in time for the dance, on Saturday night, at the last minute, and entering the Hilton ballroom in jeans and worn-out t-shirts, just in time for the last dance, and dancing while everyone would point at us and marvel that Margo had returned, and then we would leave dancing the foxtrot and go get ice cream at Friendly’s.</t2873> <t2874>So yes, like Ben, I harbored ridiculous fantasies about the dance.</t2874> <t2875>But at least I didn't say mine out loud.</t2875>
<t2876>Sometimes Ben was such a self-centered idiot that I had to remind myself why I still liked him.</t2876> <t2877>At least sometimes he had surprisingly brilliant ideas.</t2877> <t2878>The door thing had been a good idea, even if it didn't work.</t2878> <t2879>And it was obvious that Margo's intention had been to tell me something more.</t2879>
<t2880>To me.</t2880>
<t2881>The track was mine.</t2881> <t2882>The doors were mine.</t2882>
<t2883>On the way to the garage, I had to pass through the living room, where my mother and father were watching TV.</t2883>
<t2884>—Do you want to see it? —my mother asked me—.</t2884> <t2885>They are about to solve the case.</t2885>
<t2886>It was a program to solve murder cases.</t2886>
<t2887>—No, thank you —I replied.</t2887>
<t2888>I crossed the kitchen and entered the garage.</t2888> <t2889>I looked for the largest flathead screwdriver we had, tucked it into the waistband of my khaki shorts, and tightened my belt.</t2889> <t2890>I grabbed a cookie from the kitchen, crossed the living room again with only slightly clumsy steps, and while they watched on TV how the mystery was solved, I removed the three nails from my bedroom door.</t2890> <t2891>When the last one came out, the door creaked and started to tilt, so with one hand I pushed it against the wall, and while positioning it, I saw a tiny piece of paper the size of my thumbnail fly out from the top hinge.</t2891> <t2892>Typical of Margo.</t2892> <t2893>Why hide something in her room if she could hide it in mine?</t2893> <t2894>I wondered when she had done it, how she had gotten into my room.</t2894> <t2895>I couldn't help but smile.</t2895>
<t2896>It was a piece of paper from the Orlando Sentinel newspaper, with straight edges on one side and torn on the other.</t2896> <t2897>I knew it was from the Sentinel because on one side it read: "do Sentinel, May 6, 2".</t2897> <t2898>The day he left.</t2898> <t2899>There was no doubt that the message was his.</t2899> <t2900>I recognized his handwriting.</t2900>
<t2901>Bartlesville Avenue 8328</t2901>
<t2902>I couldn't put the door back in place without hitting the nails with the screwdriver, which would surely have alerted my parents, so I put the door on the hinges and left it open.</t2902> <t2903>I put the nails in my pocket, went to the computer, and looked for a map that showed 8328 Bartlesville Avenue.</t2903> <t2904>I had never heard of that street.</t2904>
<t2905>It was in the middle of nowhere, at 55.</t2905> <t2906>5 kilometers along the Colonial Drive highway, almost in the city of Christmas, Florida.</t2906> <t2907>When I enlarged the map where the building appeared, it looked like a black rectangle with a silver strip in front and grass behind.</t2907> <t2908>A mobile home perhaps?</t2908> <t2909>It was difficult to get an idea of the scale because it was surrounded by greenery.</t2909>
<t2910>I called Ben to tell him about it.</t2910>
<t2911>—I was right! —he exclaimed—.</t2911> <t2912>I'm eager to tell Lacey, who was also convinced that it was a good idea.</t2912>
<t2913>I overlooked the comment about Lacey.</t2913>
<t2914>—I think I'm going to go —I snapped at him.</t2914>
<t2915>—Yes, of course, of course you have to go.</t2915> <t2916>I will go with you.</t2916> <t2917>We can go on Sunday morning.</t2917> <t2918>I will be tired after spending the night at the dance, but it doesn't matter.</t2918>
<t2919>—No, I mean that I am going to go tonight —I told him.</t2919>
<t2920>—Colleague, it's dark.</t2920> <t2921>You can't go into a building you don't know in the dark with a mysterious address.</t2921> <t2922>Have you never seen a horror movie?</t2922>
<t2923>—Maybe Margo is there —I told him.</t2923>
<t2924>—Yes, and there could also be a demon there that feeds on kids' pancreases —he replied to me—.</t2924> <t2925>Damn, at least wait until tomorrow, although after rehearsal I have to go order Lacey's bouquet and then I want to stay home in case she logs into the chat, because we've been chatting a lot lately…</t2925>
<t2926>I cut it.</t2926>
<t2927>—No.</t2927> <t2928>Tonight.</t2928> <t2929>I want to see her.</t2929>
<t2930>I felt that the circle was beginning to close.</t2930> <t2931>If I hurried, I could see her in an hour.</t2931>
<t2932>—Colleague, I'm not going to let you go off to who knows where in the middle of the night.</t2932> <t2933>If necessary, I'll shoot you in the butt with a Taser to immobilize you.</t2933>
<t2934>—Tomorrow morning —I said mostly to myself—.</t2934> <t2935>I will go tomorrow morning.</t2935>
<t2936>Anyway, he was tired of not having a single absence.</t2936> <t2937>Ben didn't say anything.</t2937> <t2938>I heard him snort under his breath.</t2938>
<t2939>—I think I'm about to catch something —he told me—.</t2939> <t2940>Fever.</t2940> <t2941>Cough. Discomfort.</t2941> <t2942>Pains.</t2942>
<t2943>I smiled.</t2943> <t2944>I hung up and called Radar.</t2944>
<t2945>—I am talking to Ben —he told me—.</t2945> <t2946>I'll call you back now.</t2946>
<t2947>He called me a minute later.</t2947> <t2948>Before I could even greet him, Radar said to me:</t2948>
<t2949>—Q, I have a terrible migraine.</t2949> <t2950>It's impossible for me to go to class tomorrow.</t2950>
<t2951>I laughed.</t2951>
<t2952>After hanging up, I stayed in my t-shirt and underwear, emptied the trash can into a drawer, and left it next to the bed.</t2952> <t2953>I set the alarm for an ungodly hour, six in the morning, and spent the following hours trying in vain to fall asleep.</t2953>
<t2954>8</t2954>
<t2955>The next morning my mother entered my room.</t2955>
<t2956>—Last night you didn't even close the door, sleepyhead —he told me.</t2956>
<t2957>I opened my eyes.</t2957>
<t2958>—I think I have gastroenteritis —I replied to him.</t2958>
<t2959>And I approached the trash can, which contained vomit.</t2959>
<t2960>—Quentin! Good heavens.</t2960> <t2961>When did it happen?</t2961>
<t2962>—Around six —I answered, and it was true.</t2962>
<t2963>—Why didn't you let us know?</t2963>
<t2964>—I was exhausted —I told him, and it was also true.</t2964>
<t2965>—Did you wake up because you were feeling unwell? —he asked me.</t2965>
<t2966>—Yes —I replied, and this time it wasn't true.</t2966>
<t2967>I had woken up because the alarm had gone off at six, then I stealthily entered the kitchen, ate a cereal bar, and drank a glass of orange juice.</t2967> <t2968>Ten minutes later, I stuck two fingers down my throat.</t2968> <t2969>I hadn't done it before getting into bed because I didn't want the room to stink all night.</t2969> <t2970>Throwing up was awful, but it was over quickly.</t2970>
<t2971>My mother took the wastebasket and I heard her cleaning it in the kitchen.</t2971> <t2972>She returned with the clean wastebasket.</t2972> <t2973>She pursed her lips worriedly.</t2973>
<t2974>—Well, I think I'll have to take the day off... —he started to say, but I cut him off.</t2974>
<t2975>—I'm fine, really —I told him—.</t2975> <t2976>I just have an upset stomach.</t2976> <t2977>Something must have disagreed with me.</t2977>
<t2978>—Are you sure?</t2978>
<t2979>—I will call you if I feel worse —I told him.</t2979>
<t2980>He gave me a kiss on the forehead.</t2980> <t2981>I felt the sticky lipstick on my skin.</t2981> <t2982>Although I wasn't really sick, for some reason it made me feel better.</t2982>
<t2983>—Do you want me to close the door? —he asked me, reaching out his hand towards it.</t2983>
<t2984>The door stayed on the hinges, but barely.</t2984>
<t2985>—No no no —I said, perhaps too nervously.</t2985>
<t2986>—Okay —he answered me—.</t2986> <t2987>I'll call the institute on my way to work.</t2987> <t2988>If you need anything, call me.</t2988> <t2989>Whatever it is.</t2989> <t2990>Or if you want me to come back home.</t2990> <t2991>And you can always call dad.</t2991> <t2992>And I'll come to check on you this afternoon, okay?</t2992>
<t2993>I nodded and pulled the blankets up to my chin.</t2993> <t2994>Although the trash can was clean, I could still smell vomit beneath the detergent, and that smell reminded me of the act of vomiting, which for some reason made me want to vomit again, but I breathed slowly through my mouth until I heard the Chrysler backing down the driveway.</t2994> <t2995>It was 7:32.</t2995> <t2996>I thought that for once I wouldn't be late.</t2996> <t2997>Not for going to school, I admit.</t2997> <t2998>But still.</t2998>
<t2999>I took a shower, brushed my teeth, and put on some dark jeans and a black t-shirt.</t2999> <t3000>I slipped the piece of newspaper into my pocket.</t3000> <t3001>I placed the nails in the hinges and prepared the backpack.</t3001> <t3002>The truth is, I didn't know what to pack, but I included the screwdriver to open doors, a copy of the map, directions to get there, a bottle of water, and the Whitman book, just in case it was there.</t3002> <t3003>I wanted to ask him some questions.</t3003>
<t3004>Ben and Radar showed up at eight o'clock sharp.</t3004> <t3005>I sat in the back seat.</t3005> <t3006>They were loudly singing a song by the Mountain Goats.</t3006>
<t3007>Ben turned around and extended his fist to me.</t3007> <t3008>I gave him a gentle punch, even though I hated that way of greeting.</t3008>
<t3009>—Q! —he shouted over the music—.</t3009> <t3010>What do you think?</t3010>
<t3011>I knew exactly what he meant.</t3011> <t3012>He was referring to listening to the Mountain Goats with your friends in a car, on a Wednesday morning in May, in search of Margo and the fantastic prize that finding her would entail.</t3012>
<t3013>—Nothing to do with calculus —I replied to him.</t3013>
<t3014>The music was too loud to talk.</t3014> <t3015>As soon as we left Jefferson Park, we rolled down the only window that worked so the world would know we had good musical taste.</t3015>
<t3016>We advanced along Colonial Drive and left behind the cinemas and bookstores that I had passed by all my life.</t3016> <t3017>But this time it was different and better, because it was during calculus hour, because I was with Ben and Radar, and because we were on our way to the place where I believed I would find Margo.</t3017> <t3018>And in the end, after thirty kilometers, Orlando gave way to the last orange groves and undeveloped ranches: the endless plain all covered with shrubs, the black moss hanging from the branches of the oaks, motionless in the warm, windless morning.</t3018> <t3019>It was the Florida where I had spent nights being bitten by mosquitoes and hunting armadillos when I was a boy scout.</t3019> <t3020>The road was full of vans, and every two kilometers or so, there was an exit from the highway: small streets that whimsically wound around houses that appeared out of nowhere, like a volcano covered in plastic.</t3020>
<t3021>A little further on, we passed a worn wooden sign that said GROVEPOINT ACRES.</t3021> <t3022>A road with cracked asphalt less than a hundred meters long led to a large expanse of gray land, indicating that Grovepoint Acres was what my mother called a pseudovision, an abandoned development before it was completed.</t3022> <t3023>My parents had pointed out pseudovisions to me a couple of times while driving with them, but I had never seen one so desolate.</t3023>
<t3024>We had traveled a little over five kilometers from Grovepoint Acres when Radar turned off the music.</t3024>
<t3025>—It must be about a kilometer away —he said.</t3025>
<t3026>I took a deep breath.</t3026> <t3027>The excitement of not being at school had started to wane.</t3027> <t3028>It didn't seem like a place where Margo would hide, or even want to go.</t3028> <t3029>Nothing like New York.</t3029> <t3030>It was the Florida you see from a plane and wonder why anyone ever thought to populate this peninsula.</t3030> <t3031>I looked at the empty asphalt.</t3031> <t3032>The heat distorted my vision.</t3032> <t3033>In front of us, I saw a small shopping center shimmering in the distance.</t3033>
<t3034>—Is that it? —I asked, leaning forward and pointing at it.</t3034>
<t3035>—It must be —Radar answered me.</t3035>
<t3036>Ben pressed the button on the music system and the three of us fell silent as he drove into a parking lot that had long been overtaken by gray sand.</t3036> <t3037>At one time, there had been a sign announcing the presence of four stores, because on one side of the road there was a worn-out post over two meters high, but the sign had long since disappeared.</t3037> <t3038>A hurricane might have torn it down or it might have rotted away with age.</t3038> <t3039>The stores hadn't fared much better.</t3039> <t3040>It was a single-story building with a flat roof, and in some places, the concrete blocks were exposed.</t3040> <t3041>The layers of paint were peeling off the walls like insects stuck to a nest.</t3041> <t3042>Damp stains formed abstract brown patterns between the shop windows.</t3042> <t3043>The shop windows were sealed with crooked sheets of chipboard.</t3043> <t3044>Suddenly, a horrible idea crossed my mind, one of those ideas you can't shake off once it crosses the threshold of consciousness: it seemed to me that this wasn't a place where one goes to live.</t3044> <t3045>It was a place where one goes to die.</t3045>
<t3046>As soon as the car stopped, the rancid smell of death invaded my nose and mouth.</t3046> <t3047>I had to swallow the mouthful of vomit that painfully rose up my throat.</t3047> <t3048>Only then, after having wasted so much time, did I understand how badly I had misinterpreted both Margo's game and the prize for winning it.</t3048>
<t3049>I get out of the car.</t3049> <t3050>Ben stands next to me and Radar next to Ben.</t3050> <t3051>And suddenly I know that this isn't funny, that it's not about proving that I deserve to go out with her.</t3051> <t3052>I can hear Margo's words the night we roamed around Orlando.</t3052> <t3053>I hear her telling me: "I don't want some kids to find me covered in flies on a Saturday morning in Jefferson Park."</t3053> <t3054>Not wanting some kids to find you in Jefferson Park is not the same as not wanting to die.</t3054>
<t3055>It doesn't seem like anyone has been here for a long time, except for the smell, that rancid and sweetish stench that distinguishes the dead from the living.</t3055> <t3056>I tell myself that Margo can't smell like that, but of course she can.</t3056> <t3057>We all can.</t3057> <t3058>I bring my arm to my nose to smell the sweat, the skin, and anything but death.</t3058>
<t3059>—MARGO? —shouts Radar.</t3059>
<t3060>A bird perched on the rusty gutter of the building releases two syllables as a response.</t3060>
<t3061>—MARGO! —Radar shouts again.</t3061>
<t3062>Nothing.</t3062> <t3063>He kicks the sand and sighs.</t3063>
<t3064>—Shit.</t3064>
<t3065>Here, in front of this building, I learn something about fear.</t3065> <t3066>I learn that it is not the banal fantasies of someone who might want something important to happen to them, even if that important thing is terrible.</t3066> <t3067>It is not the disgust of seeing a stranger dead, nor the shortness of breath when you hear a shotgun being loaded in front of Becca Arrington's house.</t3067> <t3068>This fear is not resolved with breathing exercises.</t3068> <t3069>This is not comparable to any fear I have felt before.</t3069> <t3070>It is the lowest of all possible emotions, you feel that it was with us before you existed, before this building existed, before the Earth existed.</t3070> <t3071>It is the fear that made fish come out of the water and develop lungs, the fear that teaches us to run, the fear that makes us bury our dead.</t3071>
<t3072>The smell causes a desperate panic to take hold of me.</t3072> <t3073>Not like when my lungs run out of air, but like when the very atmosphere runs out of air.</t3073> <t3074>I think the reason I've spent most of my life scared is perhaps because I was trying to prepare and train my body for when real fear arrived.</t3074> <t3075>But I am not prepared.</t3075>
<t3076>—Colleague, we should leave —says Ben—.</t3076> <t3077>We should call the cops or whoever.</t3077>
<t3078>We still haven't looked at each other.</t3078> <t3079>The three of us continue looking at the building, an abandoned building that has been vacant for a long time and can only house corpses.</t3079>
<t3080>—No —says Radar—.</t3080> <t3081>No no no no no.</t3081> <t3082>We'll call them if there's a reason to call them.</t3082> <t3083>She left the address to Q, not to the cops.</t3083> <t3084>We need to find a way to get in.</t3084>
<t3085>—Enter? —asks Ben doubtfully.</t3085>
<t3086>I give Ben a pat on the back, and for the first time all day, we don't look ahead, but instead, we look at each other.</t3086> <t3087>It makes it more bearable.</t3087> <t3088>When I look at them, something makes me feel that Margo isn't dead if we haven't found her.</t3088>
<t3089>—Yes, come in —I say.</t3089>
<t3090>I no longer know who Margo is, or who she was, but I have to find her.</t3090>
<t3091>9</t3091>
<t3092>We circled the building to the back and found four closed steel doors, and nothing else except for land with dwarf palm trees scattered across an expanse of green grass with golden hues.</t3092> <t3093>It still smells worse here and I'm more scared to keep walking.</t3093> <t3094>Ben and Radar are right behind me, to my right and left, forming a triangle.</t3094> <t3095>We move slowly as we scan the area with our eyes.</t3095>
<t3096>—A raccoon! —shouts Ben—.</t3096> <t3097>Thank you, my God.</t3097> <t3098>It's a raccoon.</t3098> <t3099>Shit.</t3099>
<t3100>Radar and I move away from the building and head towards the animal, which is next to a shallow drainage ditch.</t3100> <t3101>A huge, swollen raccoon with matted fur lies dead, with no visible wounds.</t3101> <t3102>Its fur has fallen off, exposing a rib.</t3102> <t3103>Radar steps back gagging, but doesn't actually vomit.</t3103> <t3104>I lean down next to him and place my hand between his shoulder blades.</t3104>
<t3105>—I'm so glad to see that damn raccoon dead —he tells me when he catches his breath.</t3105>
<t3106>But, even so, I can't imagine her alive here.</t3106> <t3107>It occurs to me that the Whitman could be a suicide note.</t3107> <t3108>I think of verses she had marked: "And to die is different from what anyone supposed, and luckier."</t3108> <t3109>"Let the mud be my inheritance, I want to grow from the grass I love; / If you want to find me, look for me under the soles of your shoes."</t3109> <t3110>For a moment I feel a flash of hope thinking about the last verse of the poem: "I stop somewhere waiting for you."</t3110> <t3111>But then I think that this first person doesn't have to be a person.</t3111> <t3112>It could also be a body.</t3112>
<t3113>Radar has moved away from the raccoon and pulls the handle of one of the four steel doors.</t3113> <t3114>I feel the urge to pray for the dead, to recite the Kaddish for this raccoon, but I don't even know it.</t3114> <t3115>I feel very sorry for him and I feel very sorry for being so glad to see him like this.</t3115>
<t3116>—It's giving way a little —Radar shouts to us—.</t3116> <t3117>Come and help me.</t3117>
<t3118>Ben and I grabbed Radar by the waist and pulled him.</t3118> <t3119>Radar placed a foot on the wall to give himself more momentum, and suddenly the two of them fell on top of me, and I found myself with Radar's sweat-soaked shirt in my face.</t3119> <t3120>For a moment I got excited, thinking we had done it, but then I realized that Radar had the door handle in his hand.</t3120> <t3121>I got up and took a look at the door: it was still closed.</t3121>
<t3122>—Damn shitty apple from the year of the pear —grumbles Radar.</t3122>
<t3123>I've never heard him speak like that.</t3123>
<t3124>—Calm down —I tell him—.</t3124> <t3125>There must be a way.</t3125> <t3126>There has to be one.</t3126>
<t3127>We go around to the front of the building.</t3127> <t3128>We don't see doors, holes, or tunnels.</t3128> <t3129>But I have to get in.</t3129> <t3130>Ben and Radar try to pull the plywood sheets off the storefronts, but they are nailed down.</t3130> <t3131>Radar kicks them, but they don't budge.</t3131> <t3132>Ben comes back to my side.</t3132>
<t3133>—Behind one of those panels, there is no glass —he tells me.</t3133>
<t3134>And he runs off.</t3134> <t3135>As he runs, his shoes scatter the sand.</t3135>
<t3136>I look at him confused.</t3136>
<t3137>—I am going to cross the plates —he explains to me.</t3137>
<t3138>—You won't be able to.</t3138>
<t3139>He is the least corpulent of the three, which is saying something.</t3139> <t3140>If anyone has to try to get through the display window panels, it should be me.</t3140>
<t3141>Clench your fists and then extend your fingers.</t3141> <t3142>As I walk towards him, he starts to say to me:</t3142>
<t3143>—In third grade, my mother tried to stop them from hitting me by signing me up for taekwondo.</t3143> <t3144>I only went to three classes, and I only learned one thing, but every now and then it's useful.</t3144> <t3145>We saw the taekwondo master break a thick block of wood and we all thought, dude, how did he do that, and he told us that if you act as if your hand is going to go through the block of wood, and if you believe that your hand is going to go through that block, then it goes through.</t3145>
<t3146>I am about to refute that absurd logic when he starts running and passes in front of me like an arrow.</t3146> <t3147>He keeps accelerating as he approaches the plank and then, fearlessly, at the last second, he jumps, twists his body, throws out his shoulder to bear the brunt of the impact, and lands on the wood.</t3147> <t3148>I almost expect him to go through it and leave his silhouette cut out, like in cartoons.</t3148> <t3149>But he bounces off the plank and lands on his butt in a grassy area in the middle of the sand.</t3149> <t3150>Ben turns to one side, rubbing his shoulder.</t3150>
<t3151>—It has broken —he says.</t3151>
<t3152>I take for granted that he is talking about the shoulder and run towards him, but he gets up and I see a crack in the particle board at his height.</t3152> <t3153>I start kicking it and the crack expands horizontally.</t3153> <t3154>Then Radar and I stick our fingers into the crack and pull.</t3154> <t3155>I squint to avoid getting sweat in my eyes and pull with all my strength until the crack starts to form a jagged opening.</t3155> <t3156>We continue in silence until Radar needs to rest and Ben takes his place.</t3156> <t3157>In the end, we manage to throw a large piece of the board inside the place.</t3157> <t3158>I stick my feet in and land blindly on what seems to be a pile of papers.</t3158>
<t3159>Through the hole we have opened, some light enters, but I cannot see the dimensions of the room, nor if there is a ceiling.</t3159> <t3160>The air is so warm and stale that inhaling produces the same sensation as exhaling.</t3160>
<t3161>I turn and bump my chin against Ben's forehead.</t3161> <t3162>I find myself speaking in whispers, even though there's no reason for it.</t3162>
<t3163>—Do you have a…?</t3163>
<t3164>—No —he also answers me in whispers before I have finished saying it—.</t3164> <t3165>Radar, did you bring a flashlight?</t3165>
<t3166>I hear Radar coming in through the hole.</t3166>
<t3167>—I have one on the keychain, but it's not a big deal.</t3167>
<t3168>Turn on the light.</t3168> <t3169>I still can't see very well, but it's clear that we have entered a large room with a labyrinth of metal shelves.</t3169> <t3170>The papers on the floor are pages from an old calendar.</t3170> <t3171>The days are scattered around the room, all of them yellowed and gnawed by mice.</t3171> <t3172>I wonder if this could have been a bookstore, although the shelves have housed nothing but dust for decades.</t3172>
<t3173>We line up behind Radar.</t3173> <t3174>I hear something creak above us and the three of us stand still.</t3174> <t3175>I try to swallow my panic.</t3175> <t3176>I hear Radar and Ben's breathing, their shuffling footsteps.</t3176> <t3177>I want to get out of here, but the creaking could be Margo.</t3177> <t3178>It could also be crack addicts.</t3178>
<t3179>—They are the foundations of the building —whispers Radar, although he seems less sure than usual.</t3179>
<t3180>I stay where I am, unable to move.</t3180> <t3181>At that moment, I hear Ben's voice.</t3181>
<t3182>—The last time I was this scared, I peed myself.</t3182>
<t3183>—The last time I was this scared —said Radar— I had to face a Dark Lord to keep the wizards safe.</t3183>
<t3184>I made a feeble attempt:</t3184>
<t3185>—The last time I was this scared, I had to sleep in my mother's room.</t3185>
<t3186>Ben lets out a chuckle.</t3186>
<t3187>—Q, if I were you, I would be so scared every night.</t3187>
<t3188>I'm not in the mood to laugh, but their laughter makes the room seem safe, so we start to explore it.</t3188> <t3189>We pass between the rows of shelves, but the only thing we find are some copies of Reader's Digest from the seventies lying on the floor.</t3189> <t3190>After a while, my eyes have adjusted to the darkness and half in the dark we start to walk in different directions and at different speeds.</t3190>
<t3191>—Let no one leave until we all leave —I whisper.</t3191>
<t3192>They whisper to me that they agree.</t3192> <t3193>I go towards a side wall of the room and find the first evidence that someone has been here after everyone else had left.</t3193> <t3194>On the wall, at waist height, there is a more or less semicircular tunnel.</t3194> <t3195>Above the hole, the words TROLL HOLE are written in orange spray, along with a helpful arrow pointing to the hole.</t3195>
<t3196>—Guys —says Radar so loudly that for a moment the spell is broken.</t3196>
<t3197>I follow his voice and find him on the other side of the wall, illuminating another Troll Hole with the flashlight.</t3197> <t3198>The graffiti doesn't look much like Margo's, but I couldn't be sure.</t3198> <t3199>I've only seen her paint one letter.</t3199>
<t3200>Radar focuses the flashlight towards the hole, and I crouch down and enter first.</t3200> <t3201>The only thing in the room is a rolled-up carpet in a corner.</t3201> <t3202>The flashlight scans the floor and I see glue stains on the concrete, where the carpet used to be.</t3202> <t3203>At the back of the room, I discover another hole in the wall, this time without graffiti.</t3203>
<t3204>I crawl through that Troll Hole into a room with rows of clothing racks.</t3204> <t3205>The stainless steel hangers are still hanging on the walls with wine-colored and damp stains.</t3205> <t3206>This room is more illuminated, and it takes me a moment to realize that it's because there are several holes in the ceiling.</t3206> <t3207>The asphalt fabric is hanging down, and I see parts where the ceiling is sagging over exposed iron beams.</t3207>
<t3208>—A souvenir shop —whispers Ben in front of me.</t3208>
<t3209>And at that moment I realize that he is right.</t3209>
<t3210>In the middle of the room, five display cases form a pentagon.</t3210> <t3211>The glass that once separated tourists from their tourist trinkets is shattered on the floor, around the display cases.</t3211> <t3212>The gray paint peels off the walls, forming beautiful patterns.</t3212> <t3213>Each polygon of peeled paint is like a snowflake of decay.</t3213>
<t3214>But the strange thing is that there are still some items left.</t3214> <t3215>There is a Mickey Mouse phone that reminds me of my childhood.</t3215> <t3216>In the display cases, sprinkled with broken glass, there are moth-eaten t-shirts, still folded, that say ORLANDO IN THE SUN.</t3216> <t3217>Under the display cases, Radar finds a box full of maps and old tourist brochures advertising Gator World, Crystal Gardens, and other attractions that no longer exist.</t3217> <t3218>Ben gestures with his hand and without saying anything points to the green glass alligator in a box, almost buried in the dust.</t3218> <t3219>This is what our memories are worth, I think.</t3219> <t3220>You can't give this crap away.</t3220>
<t3221>We go back through the empty room and the room with the shelves, and we crawl through the last Troll Hole.</t3221> <t3222>This room looks like an office, only it doesn't have computers, and it gives the impression that it was abandoned in a hurry, as if the workers had been teleported into space or something like that.</t3222> <t3223>Twenty tables arranged in four rows.</t3223> <t3224>There are still pens on some tables, and all of them are covered with giant paper calendars.</t3224> <t3225>All the calendars stopped in February 1986.</t3225> <t3226>Ben pushes a desk chair, which squeaks rhythmically as it turns.</t3226> <t3227>Thousands of post-it notes with advertisements for the Martin-Gale mortgage company are piled in an unstable pyramid shape under a table.</t3227> <t3228>There are open boxes with stacks of paper from old dot matrix printers detailing the expenses and income of the Martin-Gale company.</t3228> <t3229>On one of the tables, someone has stacked brochures of housing developments to form a one-story house.</t3229> <t3230>I spread out the brochures to see if they hide any clues, but no.</t3230>
<t3231>—Nothing after 1986 —sighs Radar, running his fingers over the papers.</t3231>
<t3232>I start to check the drawers.</t3232> <t3233>I find cotton swabs and pins.</t3233> <t3234>Pens and pencils packed ten by ten in cardboard boxes with retro letters and designs.</t3234> <t3235>Paper napkins.</t3235> <t3236>A pair of golf gloves.</t3236>
<t3237>—Do you see the slightest indication that anyone has been here in the last twenty years, for instance? —I ask them.</t3237>
<t3238>—Only the Troll Holes —Ben answers me.</t3238>
<t3239>It is a tomb, all covered in dust.</t3239>
<t3240>—And then why did you bring us here? —asks Radar.</t3240>
<t3241>We finally started talking.</t3241>
<t3242>—No idea —I answered.</t3242>
<t3243>There is no doubt that Margo is not here.</t3243>
<t3244>—There are spots with less dust —says Radar—.</t3244> <t3245>In the empty room, there is a dust-free rectangle, as if something had been moved.</t3245> <t3246>But I don't know.</t3246>
<t3247>—And this section is painted —observes Ben, pointing to a wall.</t3247>
<t3248>Radar's flashlight shows me that on the back wall of the office there is a section that has been given a coat of white paint, as if someone had thought of remodeling it but abandoned the project after half an hour.</t3248> <t3249>I approach the wall and see that underneath the paint there is something written in red.</t3249> <t3250>But I only see traces of red paint seeping through, not enough to know what it says.</t3250> <t3251>Next to the wall, there is an open can of white paint.</t3251> <t3252>I kneel down and dip my finger into the paint.</t3252> <t3253>The surface is hard, but it breaks easily, so I pull out my white finger.</t3253> <t3254>I say nothing while the paint drips from my finger, because we have all come to the same conclusion: someone has been here recently.</t3254> <t3255>And then the building creaks again, and Radar drops the flashlight and lets out a curse.</t3255>
<t3256>—This is very strange —he comments.</t3256>
<t3257>—Guys —says Ben.</t3257>
<t3258>As the flashlight is still on the ground, I take a step back to pick it up, but then I see Ben pointing.</t3258> <t3259>What he's pointing at is the wall.</t3259> <t3260>With the indirect light, the letters of the graffiti have pierced through the layer of paint.</t3260> <t3261>In that moment, I know that those ghostly gray letters are from Margo.</t3261>
<t3262>YOU WILL GO TO THE PAPER TOWNS</t3262>
<t3263>AND YOU WILL NEVER RETURN</t3263>
<t3264>I grab the flashlight, shine it directly at the painting, and the message disappears.</t3264> <t3265>But when I focus on another area of the wall, it becomes readable again.</t3265>
<t3266>—Shit —says Radar in a low voice.</t3266>
<t3267>—Colleague, can we leave now? —asks Ben—.</t3267> <t3268>Because the last time I was this scared...</t3268> <t3269>To hell with it.</t3269> <t3270>I'm terrified.</t3270> <t3271>This shit isn't fun at all.</t3271>
<t3272>I think "This shit isn't fun at all" is what comes closest to my own terror.</t3272> <t3273>And for me, that's close enough.</t3273> <t3274>I hurry towards the Troll Hole.</t3274> <t3275>I feel the walls closing in on us.</t3275>
<t3276>10</t3276>
<t3277>Ben and Radar dropped me off at home.</t3277> <t3278>Although they hadn't gone to class, they couldn't afford to skip rehearsal.</t3278> <t3279>I sat for a good while with "Song of Myself," and for the umpteenth time, I tried to read the entire poem, starting from the beginning, but the problem was that it's like eighty pages long, it's weird and repetitive, and even though I understood all the words, I didn't understand what it was trying to say.</t3279> <t3280>Even though I knew that probably the only important parts were the marked verses, I wanted to know if the poem was some kind of suicide note.</t3280> <t3281>But I didn't understand anything.</t3281>
<t3282>I had already read ten confusing pages when I became so hysterical that I decided to call the detective.</t3282> <t3283>I took his card out of a pair of shorts from the dirty laundry basket.</t3283> <t3284>He answered on the second ring.</t3284>
<t3285>—Warren.</t3285>
<t3286>Hello, um, I am Quentin Jacobsen, a friend of Margo Roth Spiegelman.</t3286>
<t3287>—Of course, boy, I remember you.</t3287> <t3288>What’s happening?</t3288>
<t3289>I told him about the clues, the mall, and the paper towns, I explained that from the top of the SunTrust Building she had told me that Orlando was a paper town, but she hadn't talked about towns in plural, that she had told me she didn't want to be found and about looking for her under the soles of our shoes.</t3289> <t3290>The detective didn't even tell me that I shouldn't enter abandoned buildings, nor did he ask me what I was doing there at ten in the morning on a school day.</t3290> <t3291>He waited until I had finished speaking.</t3291>
<t3292>—For God's sake, boy, you're almost a detective.</t3292> <t3293>The only thing you're missing is a gun, a good belly, and three ex-wives.</t3293> <t3294>What's your theory?</t3294>
<t3295>—I'm worried that he might have... well, that he might have committed suicide, I suppose.</t3295>
<t3296>—It has never crossed my mind that this girl did anything other than run away, boy.</t3296> <t3297>I understand what you're telling me, but remember that she has done it before.</t3297> <t3298>I'm referring to the clues.</t3298> <t3299>She adds a bit of drama that way.</t3299> <t3300>Honestly, if she had wanted you to find her, alive or dead, you would have found her by now.</t3300>
<t3301>—But didn't you…?</t3301>
<t3302>—Boy, we have the bad luck that legally she is an adult and free, you know?</t3302> <t3303>Allow me to give you some advice: wait for her to come back.</t3303> <t3304>Well, at some point you'll stop looking at the sky, or one of these days you'll look down and see that you too have flown away.</t3304>
<t3305>I hung up with a bad taste in my mouth.</t3305> <t3306>It was clear that what would lead me to Margo would not be Warren's poetry.</t3306> <t3307>I kept thinking about the final verses that Margo had marked: "Let the mud be my heir, I want to grow from the grass I love; / If you want to find me, look for me under the sole of your shoes."</t3307> <t3308>In the first pages, Whitman writes that this grass, this herb, is "the loose and beautiful hair of graves."</t3308> <t3309>But where were the graves?</t3309> <t3310>Where were the paper towns?</t3310>
<t3311>I entered the Omnictionary to see if anything more was known about the expression "paper towns."</t3311> <t3312>I found an enormously detailed and useful entry created by a user named skunkbutt: "A Paper Town is a town with a paper factory."</t3312> <t3313>That was the flaw of the Omnictionary: the entries written by Radar were exhaustive and tremendously useful, but the one by this skunkbutt left much to be desired.</t3313> <t3314>But when I searched the web in general, I found something interesting hidden among the entries of a forum about real estate properties in Kansas.</t3314>
<t3315>It seems that Madison Estates is not going to be built.</t3315> <t3316>My husband and I bought a house, but this week they called us to say that they are going to return our deposit because they have not sold enough houses to finance the project.</t3316> <t3317>Another paper city for Kansas! - Marge, Cawker, Kansas.</t3317>
<t3318>A pseudovision!</t3318> <t3319>You will go to the pseudovisions and you will never return.</t3319> <t3320>I took a deep breath and kept looking at the screen.</t3320>
<t3321>The conclusion seemed irrefutable.</t3321> <t3322>Although everything inside her had broken and she had made her decision, she did not allow herself to disappear forever, so she had decided to leave her body —leave it to me— in a gloomy version of our neighborhood, where the first threads had broken.</t3322> <t3323>She had said that she didn't want any child to find her body, and it seemed logical that, of all the people she knew, she chose me to find it.</t3323> <t3324>It wouldn't hurt me as much because it wouldn't be new to me.</t3324> <t3325>It had already happened to me before.</t3325> <t3326>I had experience in the matter.</t3326>
<t3327>I saw that Radar was online, and I was about to click to talk to him when a message from him appeared on the screen.</t3327>
<t3328>OMNICTIONARIAN96: Hello.</t3328>
<t3329>QTHERESURRECTION: Paper towns = pseudovisions.</t3329> <t3330>I think she wants me to find her body.</t3330> <t3331>Because she thinks I will be able to handle it.</t3331> <t3332>Because we found a dead guy when we were kids.</t3332>
<t3333>I sent him the link.</t3333>
<t3334>OMNICTIONARIAN96: Calm down.</t3334> <t3335>Wait until they see the link.</t3335>
<t3336>QTHERESURRECTION: OK.</t3336>
<t3337>OMNICTIONARIAN96: Okay, don't be so macabre.</t3337> <t3338>You don't know anything for sure.</t3338> <t3339>I think it's probably fine.</t3339>
<t3340>QTHERESURRECTION: No, you don't believe it.</t3340>
<t3341>OMNICTIONARIAN96: Okay, I don't believe it.</t3341> <t3342>But she might be alive despite the evidence...</t3342>
<t3343>QTHERESURRECTION: Yes, I suppose.</t3343> <t3344>I'm going to bed.</t3344> <t3345>My parents will be here soon.</t3345>
<t3346>But I couldn't calm down, so I called Ben from the bed and told him my theory.</t3346>
<t3347>—What macabre shit, buddy.</t3347> <t3348>Margo is fine.</t3348> <t3349>She's just playing.</t3349>
<t3350>—It doesn't seem to worry you too much.</t3350>
<t3351>He sighed.</t3351>
<t3352>—Well, it's a bummer on their part to make you miss the last three weeks of class, you know?</t3352> <t3353>You're very worried, and Lacey is very worried, and there are three days left until the dance, you know?</t3353> <t3354>Can't we just have a peaceful dance and have fun?</t3354>
<t3355>—Are you serious?</t3355> <t3356>Ben, she could be dead.</t3356>
<t3357>—She is not dead.</t3357> <t3358>She is the queen of drama.</t3358> <t3359>She wants to get attention.</t3359> <t3360>Look, I know her parents are assholes, but they know her better than we do, right?</t3360> <t3361>And her parents think the same.</t3361>
<t3362>—When you want to be, you are a perfect jerk.</t3362>
<t3363>—Whatever you say, buddy.</t3363> <t3364>The day has been long for both of us.</t3364> <t3365>Too much melodrama.</t3365> <t3366>TTYS.</t3366>
<t3367>I wanted to laugh at him for using chat acronyms IRL, but I didn't have the strength.</t3367>
<t3368>I hung up and went back online in search of a list of Florida's pseudo-visions.</t3368> <t3369>I couldn't find it anywhere, but after typing "abandoned developments," "Grovepoint Acres," and things like that for a while, I managed to get a list of five places less than three hours from Jefferson Park.</t3369> <t3370>I printed a map of central Florida, pinned it to the wall above the computer, and put a pin in each of the five locations.</t3370> <t3371>At first glance, I didn't detect the slightest connection between them.</t3371> <t3372>They were randomly scattered among the farthest developments, so I would need at least a week to visit them all.</t3372> <t3373>Why hadn't he left me a specific place?</t3373> <t3374>Several damn sinister clues, several hints of tragedy, but not a single place.</t3374> <t3375>Nothing to hold on to.</t3375> <t3376>Like trying to climb a gravel mountain.</t3376>
<t3377>Ben gave me permission to take the Chuco the next day, because he was going shopping with Lacey in his SUV.</t3377> <t3378>So for once, I didn't have to wait at the rehearsal room door.</t3378> <t3379>The bell rang and I ran to his car.</t3379> <t3380>Since I didn't have Ben's talent for starting the Chuco, I was one of the first to arrive at the senior parking lot and one of the last to leave, but in the end, the engine caught and I set off towards Grovepoint Acres.</t3380>
<t3381>I drove slowly through Colonial, looking for other pseudovisions that might have escaped me in the net.</t3381> <t3382>There was a long line of cars behind me, and I was anxious thinking that I was creating a traffic jam.</t3382> <t3383>I was surprised that I could still worry about insignificant and ridiculous bullshit like whether the guy in the car behind me thought I was driving too cautiously.</t3383> <t3384>I would have liked Margo's disappearance to have changed me, but the truth was that it hadn't.</t3384>
<t3385>While the line of cars crawled behind me like a reluctant funeral procession, I found myself talking to Margo out loud.</t3385> <t3386>«I will follow the thread.</t3386> <t3387>I will not betray your trust.</t3387> <t3388>I will find you».</t3388>
<t3389>As strange as it may seem, speaking to her out loud calmed me.</t3389> <t3390>It prevented me from imagining the various possibilities.</t3390> <t3391>I reached the worn wooden sign of Grovepoint Acres.</t3391> <t3392>I almost heard the sighs of relief from those following me when I turned left onto the dead-end paved road.</t3392> <t3393>It seemed like an access road to a house but without a house.</t3393> <t3394>I left the Chuco running and got out.</t3394> <t3395>As I approached, I saw that Grovepoint Acres was more rundown than it initially appeared.</t3395> <t3396>They had opened two dead-end dirt roads in the ground, although they had eroded so much that the outlines were barely visible.</t3396> <t3397>I walked up and down the two streets, feeling the heat in my nose with each breath.</t3397> <t3398>The scorching sun made movement difficult, but I knew the pretty, though macabre, truth: heat makes the dead stink, and Grovepoint Acres only smelled of hot air and exhaust fumes.</t3398> <t3399>The humidity caused the accumulation of exhalations to linger in the air around me.</t3399>
<t3400>I looked for evidence that Margo had been there: footprints, something written in the dirt, or anything she might have left behind, but it seemed like I was the first person to walk those nameless streets in years.</t3400> <t3401>The ground was flat and not much grass had grown yet, so I had a clear view in all directions.</t3401> <t3402>I saw no tents, no traces of campfires, and no Margo.</t3402>
<t3403>I returned to Chuco, headed to I-4, and turned northeast of the city, towards a place called Holly Meadows.</t3403> <t3404>I passed it by three times before finally finding it, because the whole area was surrounded by oaks and ranches, and since there was no sign indicating the entrance, Holly Meadows was not visible.</t3404> <t3405>But as soon as I advanced a few meters on an unpaved road between the oaks and pines, everything appeared as desolate as in Grovepoint Acres.</t3405> <t3406>The main road slowly dissolved into a dirt terrain.</t3406> <t3407>I didn't see any other roads, but while walking I discovered several wooden posts on the ground painted with spray paint.</t3407> <t3408>I assumed they had been used to delineate the land.</t3408> <t3409>I didn't smell or see anything suspicious, but still, I felt fear taking hold of me, and at first, I didn't understand why, but then I saw it: when clearing the area to build, they had left a solitary oak at the back of the field.</t3409> <t3410>And the twisted tree, with its branches covered in thick bark, looked so much like the tree where we had found Robert Joyner, in Jefferson Park, that I was sure Margo was there, on the other side of the tree.</t3410>
<t3411>And for the first time, I had to imagine it: Margo Roth Spiegelman collapsed on the tree, her eyes silent, dark blood coming out of her mouth, all swollen and deformed because it had taken too long to find her.</t3411> <t3412>She had trusted that I would find her sooner.</t3412> <t3413>She had entrusted me with her last night.</t3413> <t3414>And I had failed her.</t3414> <t3415>And although the smell of the air only suggested that rain was coming, I was sure that I had found her.</t3415>
<t3416>But no.</t3416> <t3417>It was just a solitary tree in the gray land.</t3417> <t3418>I sat down, leaned against the trunk, and waited to catch my breath.</t3418> <t3419>I hated being alone in those moments.</t3419> <t3420>I hated it.</t3420> <t3421>If Margo thought that Robert Joyner had prepared me for this, she was wrong.</t3421> <t3422>I didn't know Robert Joyner.</t3422> <t3423>I didn't love Robert Joyner.</t3423>
<t3424>I pounded the ground with my knuckles and kept hitting it over and over again.</t3424> <t3425>The sand gave way around my hands until I reached the tree roots, and I kept hitting.</t3425> <t3426>Pain shot up through my palms and wrists.</t3426> <t3427>Until that moment, I hadn't cried for Margo, but I finally did, pounding the ground and screaming because no one could hear me.</t3427> <t3428>I missed her I missed her I missed her I miss her.</t3428>
<t3429>I stayed there, even though my arms were exhausted and my eyes had dried up.</t3429> <t3430>I sat thinking about her until the light turned gray.</t3430>
<t3431>11</t3431>
<t3432>The next day I found Ben by the rehearsal room door, chatting with Lacey, Radar, and Angela in the shade of a low-branched tree.</t3432> <t3433>I found it difficult to hear them talk about the dance, about Lacey having fought with Becca, or whatever else.</t3433> <t3434>I was waiting for the opportunity to tell them what I had seen, but when I finally had it, I realized that I actually had nothing new to tell.</t3434>
<t3435>—I thoroughly reviewed two pseudovisions, but I found nothing.</t3435>
<t3436>Nobody seemed particularly interested, except for Lacey, who was shaking her head while recounting the pseudovisions.</t3436>
<t3437>—Last night I read on the internet that people who commit suicide break off relationships with those they are angry with.</t3437> <t3438>And they give away their things.</t3438> <t3439>Last week Margo gave me five pairs of jeans because she said they would fit me better, and it's not true, because she has a lot more curves.</t3439>
<t3440>I liked Lacey, but I understood what Margo had told me about her always undermining her.</t3440>
<t3441>When she told us, she started to cry.</t3441> <t3442>Ben put an arm around her waist, and she rested her head on his shoulder, which was not easy for her because, with heels, she was taller than him.</t3442>
<t3443>—Lacey, we have to find her.</t3443> <t3444>Anyway, talk to your friends.</t3444> <t3445>Did she ever talk about paper towns?</t3445> <t3446>Did she talk about any specific place?</t3446> <t3447>Was there any subdivision somewhere that meant something to her?</t3447>
<t3448>Lacey shrugged, still leaning on Ben.</t3448>
<t3449>—Colleague, don't pressure her —Ben warned me.</t3449>
<t3450>I sighed, but I didn't say anything.</t3450>
<t3451>—I'm on the internet —said Radar—, but their username hasn't logged into Omnictionary since they left.</t3451>
<t3452>And suddenly they returned to the topic of the dance.</t3452> <t3453>Lacey lifted her head from Ben's shoulder with a sad and distracted air, but tried to smile while Radar and Ben exchanged stories about buying flowers.</t3453>
<t3454>The day went by as usual, in slow motion and with a thousand pitiful glances at the clock.</t3454> <t3455>But it was even more unbearable, because every minute lost at the institute was another minute he couldn't find her.</t3455>
<t3456>The only remotely interesting class that day was literature, when Dr. Holden spoiled the ending of Moby Dick by assuming, mistakenly, that we had all read it and talking about Captain Ahab and his obsession with finding and killing the white whale.</t3456> <t3457>But it was fun to see how excited she got as she spoke.</t3457>
<t3458>—Ahab is a madman who rants about fate.</t3458> <t3459>Throughout the entire novel, it is clear he wants nothing else, right?</t3459> <t3460>He has a single obsession.</t3460> <t3461>And since he is the captain of the ship, no one can stop him.</t3461> <t3462>You can argue (in fact, you have to argue if you decide to do your final paper on Moby Dick) that Ahab is mad because he is obsessed.</t3462> <t3463>But you could also argue that there is something tragically heroic about fighting a battle he is doomed to lose.</t3463> <t3464>Is Ahab's hope a kind of madness or is it the symbol of what it means to be human?</t3464>
<t3465>I took notes on everything I could, thinking that I would surely be able to do the end-of-term paper without having read the book.</t3465> <t3466>While Dr. Holden was speaking, I thought she was an extraordinary reader.</t3466> <t3467>And she had told me that she liked Whitman.</t3467> <t3468>So when the bell rang, I took Leaves of Grass out of my backpack and closed it slowly while everyone else ran off to their homes or extracurricular activities.</t3468> <t3469>I waited behind a classmate who asked for an extension to submit a paper.</t3469>
<t3470>—My favorite Whitman reader —Dr. Holden told me when the student left.</t3470>
<t3471>I forced a smile.</t3471>
<t3472>—Do you know Margo Roth Spiegelman? —I asked him.</t3472>
<t3473>He sat at his table and indicated with a gesture that I should sit as well.</t3473>
<t3474>—I've never had her in class —Dr. Holden replied to me—, but I've heard of her, of course.</t3474> <t3475>I know she has escaped.</t3475>
<t3476>—Well, he left me this book of poems before… disappearing.</t3476>
<t3477>I handed her the book, and Dr. Holden began to leaf through it slowly.</t3477> <t3478>As she turned the pages, I said to her:</t3478>
<t3479>—I have pondered a lot over the marked verses.</t3479> <t3480>At the end of the "Song of Myself" it points out that about death.</t3480> <t3481>That part of "If you want to find me, look for me under the sole of your shoes."</t3481>
<t3482>—He left you this book —murmured Dr. Holden as if to herself.</t3482>
<t3483>—Yes —I replied to him.</t3483>
<t3484>He kept turning the pages and pointed with his nail to the quote highlighted in green fluorescent.</t3484>
<t3485>—What is this about the hinges?</t3485> <t3486>It is a great moment in the poem, in which Whitman...</t3486> <t3487>Well, you hear him shouting at you: "Open the doors!</t3487> <t3488>In fact, tear them off!"</t3488>
<t3489>—He left something inside the hinge of my door.</t3489>
<t3490>The doctor Holden laughed.</t3490>
<t3491>—Wow. Smart.</t3491> <t3492>But it's a very good poem...</t3492> <t3493>I don't like it at all when it's reduced to a literal reading.</t3493> <t3494>And it seems that he reacted very enigmatically to a poem that is ultimately very optimistic.</t3494> <t3495>The poem is about our connection, that we all share the same roots, like blades of grass.</t3495>
<t3496>—But, well, from what it indicated, it seems like some kind of suicide note —I told him.</t3496>
<t3497>Dr. Holden read the last stanzas again and looked at me.</t3497>
<t3498>—It is a big mistake to summarize this poem as something without hope.</t3498> <t3499>I hope that is not the case, Quentin.</t3499> <t3500>If you read the whole poem, I don't understand how you can come to any other conclusion than that life is sacred and valuable.</t3500> <t3501>But... who knows.</t3501> <t3502>Maybe he took a glance to find what he was looking for.</t3502> <t3503>We often read poems like that.</t3503> <t3504>But if that was the case, he totally misunderstood what Whitman was asking of him.</t3504>
<t3505>—And what did he ask for?</t3505>
<t3506>He closed the book and looked at me so intently that I couldn't hold his gaze.</t3506>
<t3507>—What do you think?</t3507>
<t3508>—I don't know —I replied, looking at a pile of graded papers on her desk—.</t3508> <t3509>I've tried to read it all the way through many times, but I haven't gotten very far.</t3509> <t3510>I practically only read the parts that Margo has marked.</t3510> <t3511>I read it to try to understand her, not Whitman.</t3511>
<t3512>He took a pencil and wrote something on the back of an envelope.</t3512>
<t3513>—Go on.</t3513> <t3514>I'm writing it down.</t3514>
<t3515>—What?</t3515>
<t3516>—What you just said —he explained to me.</t3516>
<t3517>—Why?</t3517>
<t3518>—Because I believe it is exactly what Whitman would have wanted.</t3518> <t3519>For you to consider "Song of Myself" not as a mere poem, but as a way to understand something else.</t3519> <t3520>But I wonder if you shouldn't read it as a poem, not just those fragments in search of quotes and clues.</t3520> <t3521>I think there are interesting connections between the poet of "Song of Myself" and Margo Spiegelman...</t3521> <t3522>That wild charisma and that wandering spirit.</t3522> <t3523>But poems don't work if you only read them in pieces.</t3523>
<t3524>—Alright, thank you —I said to him.</t3524>
<t3525>I grabbed the book and stood up.</t3525> <t3526>I didn't feel much better.</t3526>
<t3527>That afternoon I drove back with Ben and stayed at his house until he went to pick up Radar to go to a sort of pre-prom party at our friend Jake's house, whose parents were out of town.</t3527> <t3528>Ben asked me to join, but I didn't feel like it.</t3528>
<t3529>I walked back home and crossed the park where Margo and I had found the dead body.</t3529> <t3530>I remembered that morning, and as I recalled it, I felt my stomach churn, not because of the dead body, but because I remembered that she had seen it first.</t3530> <t3531>Not even in the playground of our neighborhood had I been able to find a corpse by myself...</t3531> <t3532>How the hell was I going to find it at that moment?</t3532>
<t3533>I tried to read "Song of Myself" again when I got home that night, but, despite Dr. Holden's advice, it still seemed like a jumble of meaningless words to me.</t3533>
<t3534>The next day I woke up early, shortly after eight, and turned on the computer.</t3534> <t3535>Ben was online, so I sent him a message.</t3535>
<t3536>QTHERESURRECTION: How was the party?</t3536>
<t3537>ITWASAKIDNEYINFECTION: Boring, of course.</t3537> <t3538>All the parties I go to are boring.</t3538>
<t3539>QTHERESURRECTION: I'm sorry I didn't go.</t3539> <t3540>You got up early.</t3540> <t3541>Do you want to come play Resurrection?</t3541>
<t3542>ITWASAKIDNEYINFECTION: Are you kidding?</t3542>
<t3543>QTHERESURRECTION: No…</t3543>
<t3544>ITWASAKIDNEYINFECTION: Do you know what day it is?</t3544>
<t3545>QTHERESURRECTION: Saturday, May 15.</t3545>
<t3546>ITWASAKIDNEYINFECTION: Colleague, the dance starts in eleven hours and forty minutes.</t3546> <t3547>I have to pick up Lacey in less than nine hours.</t3547> <t3548>I still haven't cleaned and polished the Chuco, which, by the way, you left in a terrible state.</t3548> <t3549>Then I have to shower, shave, trim my nose hairs, and polish myself up too.</t3549> <t3550>Damn, let's not start.</t3550> <t3551>I have a lot to do.</t3551> <t3552>Look, I'll call you later if I can.</t3552>
<t3553>Radar was also connected, so I sent him a message.</t3553>
<t3554>QTHERESURRECTION: What is happening to Ben?</t3554>
<t3555>OMNICTIONARIAN96: Hold your horses, cowboy.</t3555>
<t3556>QTHERESURRECTION: Sorry, it just pisses me off that you think dancing is so important.</t3556>
<t3557>OMNICTIONARIAN96:</t3557> <t3558>Well, you're going to get pretty mad when you find out that I got up so early just because I have to go pick up my tuxedo, right?</t3558>
<t3559>QTHERESURRECTION: Damn.</t3559> <t3560>Seriously?</t3560>
<t3561>OMNICTIONARIAN96: Q, tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, the following day, and every day I have left in my life, I will be delighted to participate in your research.</t3561> <t3562>But I have a girlfriend.</t3562> <t3563>She wants the prom to be beautiful.</t3563> <t3564>I also want the prom to be beautiful.</t3564> <t3565>It's not my fault that Margo Roth Spiegelman didn't want our prom to be beautiful.</t3565>
<t3566>I didn't know what to say.</t3566> <t3567>Maybe she was right.</t3567> <t3568>Maybe Margo deserved to be forgotten.</t3568> <t3569>But, in any case, I couldn't forget her.</t3569>
<t3570>My mother and my father were still in bed, watching an old movie on TV.</t3570>
<t3571>—Can I take the car? —I asked.</t3571>
<t3572>—Of course, why?</t3572>
<t3573>—I have decided to go to the prom —I answered immediately.</t3573> <t3574>The lie occurred to me as I was saying it—.</t3574> <t3575>I have to pick up a tuxedo and stop by Ben's house.</t3575> <t3576>We will go just the two of us.</t3576>
<t3577>My mother sat up smiling.</t3577>
<t3578>—Well, great, darling.</t3578> <t3579>You will have a fantastic time.</t3579> <t3580>Will you come back so we can take pictures of you?</t3580>
<t3581>—Mom, do you really need pictures of me going to the dance alone?</t3581> <t3582>I mean, hasn't my life been humiliating enough already?</t3582>
<t3583>He laughed.</t3583>
<t3584>—Call before curfew —my father told me.</t3584>
<t3585>The curfew was at midnight.</t3585>
<t3586>—Of course —I replied.</t3586>
<t3587>It was so easy to lie to them that I found myself wondering why, until that night with Margo, I had hardly done it.</t3587>
<t3588>I took the I-4 towards Kissimmee and the theme parks, passed onto I-Drive, from where Margo and I had entered SeaWorld, and then took Highway 27 towards Haines City.</t3588> <t3589>In that area, there are many lakes, and around the lakes in Florida, the rich always congregate, so it seemed unlikely to find a pseudovision.</t3589> <t3590>But the website I had consulted offered concrete details about a foreclosed land where no one had yet built.</t3590> <t3591>I recognized it immediately because access to all the other developments was fenced off, while in Quail Hollow there was just a simple plastic sign stuck in the ground.</t3591> <t3592>Upon entering, I saw plastic signs saying FOR SALE, IDEAL LOCATION, and GREAT DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES.</t3592>
<t3593>Unlike the previous pseudovisions, someone was in charge of maintaining Quail Hollow.</t3593> <t3594>They hadn't built houses, but the plots were marked with posts and the grass was freshly mowed.</t3594> <t3595>All the streets were paved and had name plates.</t3595> <t3596>In the center of the development, they had built a perfectly circular lake and, for some reason, they had drained it.</t3596> <t3597>As I approached with the car, I saw that it must have been about a meter deep and about one hundred fifty in diameter.</t3597> <t3598>A hose zigzagged across the bottom to the center, where a steel and aluminum fountain stood.</t3598> <t3599>I found myself glad that the lake was empty, because that way I wouldn't have to stare at the water wondering if Margo was at the bottom, waiting for me to put on a diving suit to find her.</t3599>
<t3600>I was sure I couldn't be in Quail Hollow.</t3600> <t3601>It bordered too many developments to be a good place to hide, whether you were alive or dead.</t3601> <t3602>But, anyway, I looked, and as I drove through the streets, I felt increasingly hopeless.</t3602> <t3603>I wanted to be glad that it wasn't there.</t3603> <t3604>But if it wasn't Quail Hollow, it would be the next one, or the next one, or the next one.</t3604> <t3605>Or maybe I would never find it.</t3605> <t3606>Was that the best thing that could happen?</t3606>
<t3607>I finished the round without having found anything and returned to the highway.</t3607> <t3608>I bought something to eat at a drive-thru restaurant and ate while driving west, towards the small abandoned shopping center.</t3608>
<t3609>12</t3609>
<t3610>Upon entering the parking lot, I noticed that they had covered the hole we had made in the particle board with blue adhesive tape.</t3610> <t3611>I wondered who had been there after us.</t3611>
<t3612>I drove the car to the back and parked next to a rusty dumpster that hadn't seen a garbage truck in decades.</t3612> <t3613>I figured I could slip through the adhesive tape if necessary, and I was heading towards the facade when I noticed that the steel doors at the back of the stores didn't have visible hinges.</t3613>
<t3614>Thanks to Margo, I had learned a couple of things about hinges, so I understood why we hadn't had any luck pulling on those doors: they opened inward.</t3614> <t3615>I approached the door of the mortgage company's office and pushed.</t3615> <t3616>It opened without the slightest resistance.</t3616> <t3617>Damn, we were such idiots.</t3617> <t3618>Undoubtedly, the person in charge of the building knew that the door wasn't locked, which made the adhesive tape seem even more out of place.</t3618>
<t3619>I took off the backpack I had prepared in the morning, took out my father's powerful flashlight, and shone the light around the entire room.</t3619> <t3620>Something of considerable size ran across the beams.</t3620> <t3621>I shuddered.</t3621> <t3622>Several lizards moved in the beam of light.</t3622>
<t3623>A single ray of light could be seen coming from a hole in the ceiling, in the front corner of the room, and some light filtered in from the other side of the conglomerate, but it practically depended on the flashlight.</t3623> <t3624>I walked through the rows of tables observing the objects we had found in the drawers and had left there.</t3624> <t3625>It was absolutely creepy to see table after table with the same calendar: February 1986.</t3625> <t3626>February 1986.</t3626> <t3627>February 1986.</t3627> <t3628>June 1986.</t3628> <t3629>February 1986.</t3629> <t3630>I turned and focused on a table located in the center of the room.</t3630> <t3631>They had changed the calendar to June.</t3631> <t3632>I leaned in and observed the calendar paper expecting to see the jagged block left after tearing off the pages, or some pen mark on the page, but the only difference from the other calendars was the date.</t3632>
<t3633>I placed the flashlight between my neck and shoulder, and started searching the drawers again, paying special attention to the June table: napkins, sharpened pencils, mortgage reports addressed to a certain Dennis McMahon, an empty pack of Marlboro Light, and an almost full bottle of red nail polish.</t3633>
<t3634>I grabbed the flashlight with one hand, the nail polish with the other, and observed it closely.</t3634> <t3635>It was so red that it almost looked black.</t3635> <t3636>I had seen that color before that night.</t3636> <t3637>On the dashboard of the minivan.</t3637> <t3638>Suddenly, the running on the beams and the creaking of the building became irrelevant.</t3638> <t3639>I felt a perverse euphoria.</t3639> <t3640>I couldn't know if it was the same bottle, of course, but it was definitely the same color.</t3640>
<t3641>I turned the jar and saw without the slightest doubt a tiny blue spray stain on the outside of the glass.</t3641> <t3642>From his spray-stained fingers.</t3642> <t3643>Then I was sure.</t3643> <t3644>He had been there after we parted that morning.</t3644> <t3645>Maybe he was still there.</t3645> <t3646>Maybe he only came out at night.</t3646> <t3647>Maybe he had put the tape on the conglomerate to maintain privacy.</t3647>
<t3648>At that moment, I decided to stay until the next day.</t3648> <t3649>If Margo had slept there, I could do it too.</t3649> <t3650>And so began a brief conversation with myself.</t3650>
<t3651>Me: But there are rats.</t3651>
<t3652>Me: Yes, but it seems they stay on the roof.</t3652>
<t3653>Me: But there are lizards.</t3653>
<t3654>Me: Oh, come on.</t3654> <t3655>When you were little, you used to cut off their tails.</t3655> <t3656>Lizards don't scare you.</t3656>
<t3657>Me: But there are rats.</t3657>
<t3658>Me: But the rats can't hurt you.</t3658> <t3659>You scare them more than they scare you.</t3659>
<t3660>Me: Okay, but what about the rats?</t3660>
<t3661>Me: Shut up.</t3661>
<t3662>In the end, it didn't matter that there were rats, at least not much, because I was in a place where Margo had been alive.</t3662> <t3663>I was in a place that had seen her after me, and that warmth made the mall an almost comfortable place.</t3663> <t3664>Well, I didn't feel like a child in his mother's arms, but I no longer ran out of breath every time I heard a noise.</t3664> <t3665>And as I felt more comfortable, it became easier for me to explore.</t3665> <t3666>I knew there were still things to find, and I was ready to find them.</t3666>
<t3667>I went through a Troll Hole and arrived at the labyrinth of shelves room.</t3667> <t3668>I walked through the aisles for a good while.</t3668> <t3669>Eventually, I went into the next Troll Hole and crawled to the empty room.</t3669> <t3670>I sat on the rolled-up carpet against the back wall.</t3670> <t3671>The chipped white paint creaked as I leaned my back against it.</t3671> <t3672>I stayed there for a while, long enough for the jagged ray of light coming through a hole in the ceiling to move three centimeters across the floor as I got used to the sounds.</t3672>
<t3673>After a while, I got bored and crawled through the last Troll Hole to the souvenir shop.</t3673> <t3674>I rummaged through the T-shirts.</t3674> <t3675>I took the box of tourist brochures from the display case and leafed through them looking for any handwritten message from Margo, but I found nothing.</t3675>
<t3676>I returned to the room that I found myself calling the library.</t3676> <t3677>I flipped through the Reader’s Digests and found a stack of National Geographics from the 1960s, but the box was so covered in dust that it was clear Margo hadn't taken out its contents.</t3677>
<t3678>I didn't start finding signs that someone had been there until I returned to the empty room.</t3678> <t3679>On the chipped wall of the carpet, I discovered nine thumbtack holes.</t3679> <t3680>Four holes formed a sort of square, and the other five were inside the square.</t3680> <t3681>I thought that maybe Margo had spent enough time there to hang some posters, although at first glance it didn't seem like any were missing when we inspected her room.</t3681>
<t3682>I unrolled part of the carpet and immediately found something else: a crushed box that had once contained twenty-four cereal bars.</t3682> <t3683>I found myself imagining Margo there, sitting on the rolled-up and moldy carpet, leaning against the wall and eating a cereal bar.</t3683> <t3684>She is alone and has nothing else to eat.</t3684> <t3685>Maybe once a day she drives to a store to buy herself a sandwich and some Mountain Dew, but she spends most of the day on this carpet or near it.</t3685> <t3686>It seemed too sad an image to be real.</t3686> <t3687>Too lonely and not at all like Margo.</t3687> <t3688>But the clues from the last ten days seemed to lead to a surprising conclusion: Margo was —at least a good part of the time— very unlike Margo.</t3688>
<t3689>I unrolled the carpet a bit more and found a blue knitted blanket, almost as thin as a newspaper.</t3689> <t3690>I picked it up, brought it to my face and yes, yes.</t3690> <t3691>Its smell.</t3691> <t3692>The lilac shampoo and almond lotion, and beyond that, the faint softness of her skin.</t3692>
<t3693>And I imagined her again: she unrolls part of the carpet every night so she doesn't dig her hip into the concrete when she sleeps on her side.</t3693> <t3694>She gets under the blanket, uses the rest of the carpet as a pillow, and falls asleep.</t3694> <t3695>But why here?</t3695> <t3696>Why is it better here than at her house?</t3696> <t3697>And if it's so good, why leave?</t3697> <t3698>That's what I couldn't imagine, and I realize that I couldn't imagine it because I didn't know Margo.</t3698> <t3699>I knew her smell, and I knew how she acted with me, and I knew how she acted with others, and I knew she liked Mountain Dew, adventure, and dramatic gestures, and I knew she was funny, smart, and generally superior to all of us.</t3699> <t3700>But I didn't know what had brought her there, or what had kept her there, or what had made her leave there.</t3700> <t3701>I didn't know why she had thousands of records, but had never told anyone she liked music.</t3701> <t3702>I didn't know what she did at night, in the dark, with the door closed, in the sealed privacy of her room.</t3702>
<t3703>And maybe it was what I needed more than anything.</t3703> <t3704>I needed to discover what Margo was like when she wasn't being Margo.</t3704>
<t3705>I lay down for a while with the blanket that smelled like her and looked at the ceiling.</t3705> <t3706>Through a hole, I could see a small piece of the afternoon sky, like a jagged canvas painted blue.</t3706> <t3707>It was the perfect place to sleep.</t3707> <t3708>You could see the stars at night without getting wet if it rained.</t3708>
<t3709>I called my parents.</t3709> <t3710>My father answered, and I told him that we were in the car, that we were going to pick up Radar and Angela, and that I would stay with Ben all night.</t3710> <t3711>He asked me not to drink, I told him I wouldn't, he said he was proud of me for deciding to go to the prom, and I wondered if he would be proud of me for deciding to do what I was actually doing.</t3711>
<t3712>The place was a bore.</t3712> <t3713>I mean that once you got past the rodents and the mysterious creaking of the walls, as if the building was about to collapse, there was nothing to do.</t3713> <t3714>No internet, no TV, no music.</t3714> <t3715>I was bored, so it kept puzzling me that she had chosen that place, because Margo had always seemed to me like someone with a very limited tolerance for boredom.</t3715> <t3716>Maybe she liked the idea of living like a poor person.</t3716> <t3717>I doubt it.</t3717> <t3718>Margo wore brand-name jeans when we snuck into SeaWorld.</t3718>
<t3719>The absence of alternative stimuli led me back to "Song of Myself," the only gift that had undoubtedly been left for me.</t3719> <t3720>I moved to a spot on the cement floor that had water stains, directly under the hole in the roof, sat cross-legged, and tilted the book so that the ray of light fell directly on it.</t3720> <t3721>And for some reason, I was finally able to read it.</t3721>
<t3722>The thing is that the poem starts very slowly, with a sort of long introduction, but around verse ninety Whitman finally begins to tell a story, so I started from there.</t3722> <t3723>Whitman is sitting on the grass (he says lying down), and then:</t3723>
<t3724>A child asked me: What is grass?, bringing it in handfuls,</t3724>
<t3725>How could I answer him?</t3725> <t3726>I don't know either.</t3726>
<t3727>I suspect that it is the flag of my character woven with hopeful green fabric.</t3727>
<t3728>There was the hope that Dr. Holden had told me about.</t3728> <t3729>The grass was a metaphor for hope.</t3729> <t3730>But that's not all.</t3730> <t3731>It goes on to say:</t3731>
<t3732>Or the handkerchief of God,</t3732>
<t3733>a fragrant garment deliberately dropped,</t3733>
<t3734>The grass is a metaphor for the greatness of God, or something like that.</t3734>
<t3735>Or I suspect that the grass itself is a child...</t3735>
<t3736>And something later:</t3736>
<t3737>A uniform hieroglyph,</t3737>
<t3738>what it means: I grow equally in the vast regions and in the narrow ones,</t3738>
<t3739>I grow equally among blacks and whites.</t3739>
<t3740>So maybe the grass is a metaphor that we are equal and basically connected, as Dr. Holden had told me.</t3740> <t3741>And then it says about the grass:</t3741>
<t3742>And now it seems to me that it is the loose and beautiful hair of the</t3742>
<t3743>tombs.</t3743>
<t3744>So the grass is also death.</t3744> <t3745>It grows above our buried bodies.</t3745> <t3746>The grass was many different things at once.</t3746> <t3747>It was bewildering.</t3747> <t3748>The grass is a metaphor for life, and for death, and for equality, and for our interconnectedness, and for children, and for God, and for hope.</t3748>
<t3749>I couldn't figure out which of these ideas was the crux of the poem, assuming any of them were.</t3749> <t3750>But thinking about the grass and the different ways of seeing it made me think about all the ways I had seen and misseen Margo.</t3750> <t3751>The ways of seeing her were not few.</t3751> <t3752>I had focused on what had become of her, but there, trying to understand the multiplicity of the grass and with the smell of the blanket still in my throat, I realized that the more important question was who I was looking for.</t3752> <t3753>I thought that if it was so complicated to answer the question "What is the grass?", it must also be complicated to answer the question "Who is Margo Roth Spiegelman?".</t3753> <t3754>Like a metaphor elusive in its breadth, in what she had left me, there was room to imagine infinitely, for an infinite series of Margos.</t3754>
<t3755>I had to narrow it down, and I assumed that there had to be things I was seeing wrong or not seeing at all.</t3755> <t3756>I wanted to tear off the roof so that the light could come in and I could see everything at once, not each thing separately with the flashlight.</t3756> <t3757>I pulled Margo's blanket aside and shouted loud enough for the rats to hear me:</t3757>
<t3758>—Am I going to find something here?</t3758>
<t3759>I returned to the desks in the office, but it seemed increasingly obvious that Margo had only used the one with the nail polish and the calendar set to the month of June.</t3759>
<t3760>I crawled through a Troll Hole, returned to the library, and once again wandered through the abandoned metal shelves.</t3760> <t3761>I searched all the shelves for dust-free marks that would indicate Margo had used them for something, but I found none.</t3761> <t3762>But suddenly, the flashlight beam passed over something on a shelf in a corner of the room, right next to the display case with the particle board.</t3762> <t3763>It was the spine of a book.</t3763>
<t3764>The book was titled Roadside America and had been published in 1998, after that place had been abandoned.</t3764> <t3765>I flipped through it holding the flashlight between my neck and shoulder.</t3765> <t3766>The book offered a list of hundreds of tourist attractions, from the world's largest ball of twine, in Darwin, Minnesota, to the world's largest ball of stamps, in Omaha, Nebraska.</t3766> <t3767>Someone had dog-eared several pages, seemingly at random.</t3767> <t3768>The book wasn't very dusty.</t3768> <t3769>Maybe SeaWorld had just been the first stop in some kind of whirlwind of adventures.</t3769> <t3770>Yes.</t3770> <t3771>It wasn't nonsense.</t3771> <t3772>That was Margo.</t3772> <t3773>Somehow she discovered that place, went to gather supplies, spent a night or two, and moved on.</t3773> <t3774>I imagined her wandering between tourist traps.</t3774>
<t3775>As the last rays of light came through the holes in the roof, I found more books on other shelves: General Guide to Nepal, Great Attractions of Canada, America by Car, Fodor's Guide to the Bahamas, and Let's Go to Bhutan.</t3775> <t3776>There didn't seem to be the slightest connection between the books, except that they were all travel books and the publication date was after the building was abandoned.</t3776> <t3777>I tucked the flashlight under my chin, loaded the pile of books, which reached from my waist to my chest, into my arms, and carried them to the empty room, which I then imagined was the bedroom.</t3777>
<t3778>So it turned out that I did spend prom night with Margo, just not in the way I had dreamed.</t3778> <t3779>Instead of bursting into the dance together, I sat, leaning against her rolled-up carpet, with her knitted blanket covering my knees, and started reading travel guides by flashlight, motionless in the dark while the cicadas sang around me.</t3779>
<t3780>Perhaps he had sat there, in the noisy darkness, and felt despair overwhelming him, and perhaps it was impossible for him not to think about death.</t3780> <t3781>I could imagine it, of course.</t3781>
<t3782>But I could also imagine the following: Margo buying those books at various flea markets, buying all the travel guides that fell into her hands at bargain prices.</t3782> <t3783>Then going there—even before she disappeared—to read them away from prying eyes.</t3783> <t3784>Reading them and trying to decide where to go.</t3784> <t3785>Yes.</t3785> <t3786>She would travel and hide, a balloon flying through the sky, covering hundreds of kilometers a day with the help of a perpetual tailwind.</t3786> <t3787>And I imagined her alive.</t3787> <t3788>Had she brought me there to give me the clues to decipher the itinerary?</t3788> <t3789>Maybe.</t3789> <t3790>Of course, I was far from having deciphered the itinerary.</t3790> <t3791>Judging by the books, she could be in Jamaica, Namibia, Topeka, or Beijing.</t3791> <t3792>But I had only just begun to look.</t3792>
<t3793>13</t3793>
<t3794>In my dream, I was lying on my back, and she had her head resting on my shoulder.</t3794> <t3795>Only the carpet separated us from the cement floor.</t3795> <t3796>She had her arm around my chest.</t3796> <t3797>We were simply lying down, sleeping.</t3797> <t3798>My God, help me.</t3798> <t3799>The only teenager in the country who dreams of sleeping with girls, and just sleeping.</t3799> <t3800>But then the mobile rang.</t3800> <t3801>My hands took two more rings to fumble for the phone, which was on top of the unrolled carpet.</t3801> <t3802>It was 3:18 in the morning.</t3802> <t3803>The one calling me was Ben.</t3803>
<t3804>—Good morning, Ben —I said to him.</t3804>
<t3805>—YESSS!!!!!! —he shouted at me.</t3805>
<t3806>I knew immediately that it was not the time to explain everything I had discovered and imagined about Margo.</t3806> <t3807>I could almost smell his alcohol breath.</t3807> <t3808>That single word, as he had shouted it, had more exclamation marks than anything he had ever said to me in his entire life.</t3808>
<t3809>—I understand that the dance is going well.</t3809>
<t3810>—YESSS! Quentin Jacobsen!</t3810> <t3811>The Q! The best Quentin in the country!</t3811> <t3812>Yes!</t3812> <t3813>—His voice faded, though I could still hear it—.</t3813> <t3814>Alright, everyone shut up, wait, shut up...</t3814> <t3815>I HAVE QUENTIN ON THE PHONE!</t3815> <t3816>—I heard a cheer and then Ben's voice returned—.</t3816> <t3817>Yes, Quentin! Yes! Dude, you have to come.</t3817>
<t3818>—Where to? —I asked him.</t3818>
<t3819>—To Becca's house!</t3819> <t3820>Do you know where it is?</t3820>
<t3821>It turned out he knew exactly where it was.</t3821> <t3822>He had been in his basement.</t3822>
<t3823>—I know where it is, but it's the middle of the night, Ben.</t3823> <t3824>And I'm in…</t3824>
<t3825>—YESSS!</t3825> <t3826>You have to come right now.</t3826> <t3827>Right now!</t3827>
<t3828>—Ben, I have more important things to do —I replied.</t3828>
<t3829>—IT'S YOUR TURN TO DRIVE!</t3829>
<t3830>—What?</t3830>
<t3831>—You have to drive!</t3831> <t3832>Yes!</t3832> <t3833>You have to!</t3833> <t3834>I'm glad you answered!</t3834> <t3835>It's fantastic!</t3835> <t3836>I have to be home by six!</t3836> <t3837>And you have to take me!</t3837> <t3838>YEEEESSSS!</t3838>
<t3839>—Can't you stay the night? —I asked him.</t3839>
<t3840>—NOOO! Booo.</t3840> <t3841>A boo for Quentin.</t3841> <t3842>Come on, everyone! Boooo, Quentin! —And they booed me—.</t3842> <t3843>They're all drunk.</t3843> <t3844>Ben, drunk.</t3844> <t3845>Lacey, drunk.</t3845> <t3846>Radar, drunk.</t3846> <t3847>No one can drive.</t3847> <t3848>Home by six.</t3848> <t3849>I promised my mom.</t3849> <t3850>Booo, Quentin, sleepyhead! You have to drive! YESSS!</t3850>
<t3851>I took a deep breath.</t3851> <t3852>If Margo had wanted to show up, she would have shown up before three.</t3852>
<t3853>—I will be there in half an hour.</t3853>
<t3854>—YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YESSSSS!!!!!!</t3854> <t3855>YES! YES!</t3855>
<t3856>Ben was still insisting when I hung up the phone.</t3856> <t3857>I stayed lying down for a moment, telling myself that I had to get up, and finally, I got up.</t3857> <t3858>I crawled through the Troll Holes half-asleep, passed by the library, reached the office, opened the back door of the building, and got into the car.</t3858>
<t3859>I arrived at Becca Arrington's neighborhood a little before four.</t3859> <t3860>On both sides of her street, there were dozens of parked cars, and I knew there would be even more people inside, because many had arrived in limousines.</t3860> <t3861>I found a spot a couple of cars away from Chuco.</t3861>
<t3862>I had never seen Ben drunk.</t3862> <t3863>A few years ago, I had drunk a bottle of "wine" rosé at a band party.</t3863> <t3864>It tasted just as bad going down as it did coming back up.</t3864> <t3865>It was Ben who sat with me in Cassie Hiney's Winnie the Pooh-themed bathroom while I projectile vomited pink liquid towards an Igor painting.</t3865> <t3866>I think the experience soured both of us on getting drunk forever.</t3866> <t3867>Well, until that night.</t3867>
<t3868>I already knew that Ben would be drunk.</t3868> <t3869>I had heard him on the phone.</t3869> <t3870>Nobody sober says "yes" so many times per minute.</t3870> <t3871>However, when I walked past several people who were smoking on Becca's lawn and opened the door to her house, I didn't expect to see Jase Worthington and two other baseball players holding an upside-down Ben in a tuxedo over a beer keg.</t3871> <t3872>He had the keg tap in his mouth, and the whole room was watching him.</t3872> <t3873>Everyone was chanting in unison: "Eighteen, nineteen, twenty," and for a moment I thought they were playing a prank on him or something.</t3873> <t3874>But no.</t3874> <t3875>While he sucked on the tap as if it were his mother's milk, small streams of beer dribbled down both sides of his mouth because he was smiling.</t3875> <t3876>"Twenty-three, twenty-four, twenty-five," everyone shouted enthusiastically.</t3876> <t3877>Apparently, something important was happening.</t3877>
<t3878>The whole scene seemed trivial and embarrassing to me.</t3878> <t3879>Paper kids with their paper fun.</t3879> <t3880>I made my way to Ben through the crowd and was surprised to run into Radar and Angela.</t3880>
<t3881>—What the hell is this? —I asked them.</t3881>
<t3882>Radar stopped counting and looked at me.</t3882>
<t3883>—Yes! —he exclaimed—.</t3883> <t3884>The driver has arrived! Yes!</t3884>
<t3885>—Why does everyone go around saying "yes"?</t3885>
<t3886>—Good question —Angela shouted at me.</t3886>
<t3887>She huffed and sighed.</t3887> <t3888>She seemed as annoyed as I was.</t3888>
<t3889>—Yeah, damn, that's a good question! —said Radar with a red plastic cup full of beer in each hand.</t3889>
<t3890>—Both of them are his —Angela explained to me in a calm tone.</t3890>
<t3891>—Why haven't they asked you to take them home? —I asked him.</t3891>
<t3892>—They wanted you —he answered me—.</t3892> <t3893>They thought that way you would come.</t3893>
<t3894>I looked at the ceiling.</t3894> <t3895>Angela also looked at the ceiling, pitying me.</t3895>
<t3896>—You must like it a lot —I said to him, nodding towards Radar, who lifted the two beer glasses and continued counting.</t3896>
<t3897>They all seemed very proud of knowing how to count.</t3897>
<t3898>—Even now, he's super cute —she replied to me.</t3898>
<t3899>—How disgusting —I told him.</t3899>
<t3900>Radar tapped me with a beer glass.</t3900>
<t3901>—Look at our Ben!</t3901> <t3902>He's like an autistic savant at a keg stand.</t3902> <t3903>It looks like he wants to break a record or something.</t3903>
<t3904>—What is a keg stand? —I asked him.</t3904>
<t3905>—That —Angela replied to me, pointing at Ben.</t3905>
<t3906>—Ah —I said—.</t3906> <t3907>Well, it's… Wow, isn't it very hard to be hanging upside down?</t3907>
<t3908>—Apparently, the longest keg stand in the history of Winter Park is sixty-two seconds —he explained to me—.</t3908> <t3909>Tony Yorrick achieved it.</t3909>
<t3910>Tony Yorrick was a gigantic guy who graduated when we were freshmen in high school and who at that time played on the University of Florida's football team.</t3910>
<t3911>I had nothing against Ben breaking a record, but I couldn't join the group that was shouting: "Fifty-eight, fifty-nine, sixty, sixty-one, sixty-two, sixty-three!".</t3911> <t3912>Then Ben took his mouth off the faucet and shouted:</t3912>
<t3913>—YESSS! I AM THE BEST!</t3913> <t3914>LET THE WORLD TREMBLE!</t3914>
<t3915>Jase and several baseball players turned him around and lifted him onto their shoulders.</t3915> <t3916>Then Ben saw me, pointed at me, and let out the most passionate "YESSS" I have ever heard in my life.</t3916> <t3917>Wow, not even soccer players get that excited when they win the World Cup.</t3917>
<t3918>Ben jumped off the shoulders of the baseball players, landed crouched in an awkward position, and then staggered to his feet.</t3918> <t3919>He put an arm around my shoulder.</t3919>
<t3920>—YES! —he repeated—.</t3920> <t3921>Quentin is here! The great Quentin!</t3921> <t3922>A round of applause for Quentin, the best friend of the fucking world champion of keg stand!</t3922>
<t3923>Jase ran his hand over my head and said to me:</t3923>
<t3924>—That's you, Q!</t3924>
<t3925>—By the way —Radar whispered in my ear—, we are like heroes to this crowd.</t3925> <t3926>Angela and I came because Ben told me they would welcome me like a king.</t3926> <t3927>Wow, they were chanting my name.</t3927> <t3928>Apparently, everyone thinks Ben is hilarious, and that's why they like us too.</t3928>
<t3929>—Wow —I exclaimed, addressing both Radar and everyone else.</t3929>
<t3930>Ben moved away from us and I saw him grabbing Cassie Hiney.</t3930> <t3931>He put his hands on her shoulders and she put hers on Ben's.</t3931>
<t3932>—My partner tonight was almost the queen of the dance —Ben said to her.</t3932>
<t3933>—I know —replied Cassie—.</t3933> <t3934>It's great.</t3934>
<t3935>—I have wanted to kiss you every day for the last three years —said Ben.</t3935>
<t3936>—I think you should do it —Cassie replied to him.</t3936>
<t3937>—YES! —exclaimed Ben—.</t3937> <t3938>Impressive!</t3938>
<t3939>But he didn't kiss Cassie.</t3939> <t3940>He turned and said to me:</t3940>
<t3941>—Cassie wants to kiss me!</t3941>
<t3942>—Yes —I replied to him.</t3942>
<t3943>—It's impressive —he said.</t3943>
<t3944>And then he seemed to forget both Cassie and me, as if the idea of kissing Cassie Hiney was better than actually kissing her.</t3944>
<t3945>—This party is great, isn't it? —asked Cassie.</t3945>
<t3946>—Yes —I replied to him.</t3946>
<t3947>—Nothing like the band's parties, huh? —he asked.</t3947>
<t3948>—Yes —I replied.</t3948>
<t3949>—Ben is crazy, but I love it —she told me.</t3949>
<t3950>—Yes.</t3950>
<t3951>—And he has very green eyes —he added.</t3951>
<t3952>—Yes, yes.</t3952>
<t3953>—Everyone says that you are cuter, but I like Ben.</t3953>
<t3954>—Okay —I replied.</t3954>
<t3955>—This party is great, isn't it? —he said.</t3955>
<t3956>—Yes —I replied to him.</t3956>
<t3957>Talking to a drunk person was like talking to a very cheerful three-year-old child with serious brain injuries.</t3957>
<t3958>As Cassie walked away, Chuck Parson approached me.</t3958>
<t3959>—Jacobsen —he said to me casually.</t3959>
<t3960>—Parson —I replied.</t3960>
<t3961>—You shaved my damn eyebrow, didn't you?</t3961>
<t3962>—Actually, I didn't shave it for you —I replied—.</t3962> <t3963>I used depilatory cream.</t3963>
<t3964>He hit me with a pretty strong slap across the chest.</t3964>
<t3965>—You're an asshole —he told me, although he was laughing—.</t3965> <t3966>You gotta have balls, buddy.</t3966> <t3967>And now you're like a shitty kapo.</t3967> <t3968>Well, maybe I'm just drunk, but right now I love your asshole ass.</t3968>
<t3969>—Thank you —I replied.</t3969>
<t3970>I felt completely detached from that crap, from that whole thing about finishing high school and having to make it clear that deep down we all love each other very much.</t3970> <t3971>And I imagined Margo at that party, or at thousands of parties like that one.</t3971> <t3972>Life seen through her eyes.</t3972> <t3973>I imagined her listening to Chuck Parson's nonsense and thinking about leaving, whether alive or dead.</t3973> <t3974>I imagined both paths with equal clarity.</t3974>
<t3975>—Do you want a beer, cocksucker? —Chuck asked me.</t3975>
<t3976>I might have forgotten he was there, but the stench of alcohol on his breath made it hard to overlook his presence.</t3976> <t3977>I shook my head and he left.</t3977>
<t3978>I wanted to go back home, but I knew I couldn't rush Ben.</t3978> <t3979>It was probably the best day of his life.</t3979> <t3980>He had the right to enjoy it.</t3980>
<t3981>So I found a staircase and headed to the basement.</t3981> <t3982>I had spent so many hours in the dark that I wanted to continue being in it.</t3982> <t3983>I just wanted to lie down somewhere half quiet and half dark, and keep imagining Margo.</t3983> <t3984>But as I passed by Becca's room, I heard some muffled noises — to be exact, moans — so I stopped at the door, which was ajar.</t3984>
<t3985>I saw the top two-thirds of Jase, shirtless, on top of Becca, who had her legs wrapped around him.</t3985> <t3986>They weren't naked, but they were on their way.</t3986> <t3987>And maybe a good person would have left, but people like me don't get many chances to see people like Becca Arrington naked, so I stayed at the door peeking.</t3987> <t3988>Then they turned around, Becca ended up on top of Jason, sighing as she kissed him and started to take off her blouse.</t3988>
<t3989>—Do you think I look good? —she asked him.</t3989>
<t3990>—Yes, yes, you're really hot, Margo —Jase replied to her.</t3990>
<t3991>—What? —said Becca, furious.</t3991>
<t3992>And I soon realized that I wasn't going to see Becca naked.</t3992> <t3993>She started screaming.</t3993> <t3994>I moved away from the door, but Jase saw me.</t3994>
<t3995>—What's wrong with you? —he shouted at me.</t3995>
<t3996>—Forget about him —shouted Becca—.</t3996> <t3997>Who gives a damn?</t3997> <t3998>What about me?</t3998> <t3999>Why are you thinking about her and not me?</t3999>
<t4000>It seemed like the best moment to leave, so I closed the door and went into the bathroom.</t4000> <t4001>I had to pee, but above all, I needed to get away from the human voices.</t4001>
<t4002>I always take a couple of seconds to start peeing after having prepared all the equipment, so I waited a second and then started to pee.</t4002> <t4003>I had just reached the phase where you shudder with relief when a female voice came from the bathtub.</t4003>
<t4004>—Who is there?</t4004>
<t4005>—Lacey? —I asked.</t4005>
<t4006>—Quentin? What the hell are you doing here?</t4006>
<t4007>I wanted to stop the peeing, but I couldn't, of course.</t4007> <t4008>Peeing is like a good book: once you start, it's very very difficult to stop.</t4008>
<t4009>—Well, to pee —I replied to him.</t4009>
<t4010>—How are you? —he asked me from the other side of the curtain.</t4010>
<t4011>—Well, well.</t4011>
<t4012>I shook off the last drops, zipped up, and blushed.</t4012>
<t4013>—Do you want to take a spin in the bathtub? —he asked me—.</t4013> <t4014>I'm not hitting on you.</t4014>
<t4015>I took a moment to respond.</t4015>
<t4016>—Of course —I finally said.</t4016>
<t4017>I pulled aside the curtain.</t4017> <t4018>Lacey smiled at me and pulled her knees up to her chest.</t4018> <t4019>I sat in front of her, with my back pressed against the cold porcelain.</t4019> <t4020>We intertwined our feet.</t4020> <t4021>She was wearing shorts, a sleeveless shirt, and very cute flip-flops.</t4021> <t4022>Her makeup had smudged a little around her eyes.</t4022> <t4023>Her hair was half up, still styled from the dance, and her legs were tanned.</t4023> <t4024>It must be said that Lacey Pemberton was very beautiful.</t4024> <t4025>She wasn't the kind of girl who could make you forget Margo Roth Spiegelman, but she was the kind of girl who could make you forget a lot of things.</t4025>
<t4026>—How was the dance? —I asked her.</t4026>
<t4027>—Ben is very sweet —she replied to me—.</t4027> <t4028>I had fun.</t4028> <t4029>But then I had a fight with Becca, she called me a slut, stood up on the couch, asked everyone to be quiet, and said that I have a sexually transmitted disease.</t4029>
<t4030>I made a face.</t4030>
<t4031>—Fuck —I exclaimed.</t4031>
<t4032>—Yes.</t4032> <t4033>I'm lost.</t4033> <t4034>It's just… Fuck, what a mess, really, because… it's so humiliating, and she knew it would be humiliating, and… what a mess.</t4034> <t4035>So I got into the bathtub, and Ben came down, but I asked him to leave me alone.</t4035> <t4036>I have nothing against Ben, but he wasn't listening to me much.</t4036> <t4037>He's drunk.</t4037> <t4038>I don't even have it.</t4038> <t4039>I had it.</t4039> <t4040>It's already healed.</t4040> <t4041>It doesn't matter.</t4041> <t4042>But I'm not a slut.</t4042> <t4043>It was a guy.</t4043> <t4044>A piece of shit.</t4044> <t4045>Fuck, I can't believe I told her.</t4045> <t4046>I should have told only Margo, not with Becca there.</t4046>
<t4047>—I'm sorry —I told her—.</t4047> <t4048>The problem is that Becca is jealous.</t4048>
<t4049>—Why would she be jealous?</t4049> <t4050>She is the queen of the dance.</t4050> <t4051>She is dating Jase.</t4051> <t4052>She is the new Margo.</t4052>
<t4053>My butt was sore against the porcelain, so I tried to reposition myself.</t4053> <t4054>My knees touched hers.</t4054>
<t4055>—No one will ever be the new Margo —I added—.</t4055> <t4056>Anyway, you have what she really wants.</t4056> <t4057>People like you.</t4057> <t4058>They think you are prettier than her.</t4058>
<t4059>Lacey shrugged timidly.</t4059>
<t4060>—Do you think I'm superficial?</t4060>
<t4061>—Well, yes.</t4061> <t4062>—I thought of myself at Becca's room door, waiting for her to take off her blouse—.</t4062> <t4063>But I am too.</t4063> <t4064>Like everyone else.</t4064>
<t4065>Many times he had thought: "I wish I had Jase Worthington's body.</t4065> <t4066>I would walk as if I knew how to walk.</t4066> <t4067>I would kiss as if I knew how to kiss."</t4067>
<t4068>—But not in the same way.</t4068> <t4069>Ben and I are superficial in the same way.</t4069> <t4070>You don't give a damn about being liked by others.</t4070>
<t4071>Which was partly true, and partly not.</t4071>
<t4072>—It matters to me more than I would like —I told him.</t4072>
<t4073>—Without Margo, everything is shit —he replied.</t4073>
<t4074>She was also drunk, but her way of being drunk didn't bother me.</t4074>
<t4075>—Yes —I admitted.</t4075>
<t4076>—I want you to take me to that place —he told me—.</t4076> <t4077>To the shopping mall.</t4077> <t4078>Ben told me about it.</t4078>
<t4079>—Yes, we can go whenever you want —I replied to him/her.</t4079>
<t4080>I told him that I had spent the night there, that I had found a bottle of nail polish and a blanket of Margo's.</t4080>
<t4081>Lacey stayed silent for a moment, breathing through her mouth.</t4081> <t4082>When she finally spoke, it was almost in a whisper.</t4082> <t4083>It seemed like a question, though she pronounced it as a statement:</t4083>
<t4084>—She is dead, right.</t4084>
<t4085>—I don't know, Lacey.</t4085> <t4086>I thought so until tonight, but now I don't know.</t4086>
<t4087>—She dead, and us... doing all this.</t4087>
<t4088>I thought of the marked verses of Whitman: "If no one in the world knows it, I am satisfied, / If everyone and each one knows it, I am satisfied."</t4088>
<t4089>—Maybe that's what he wanted, for life to go on —I said.</t4089>
<t4090>—That doesn't sound like my Margo —he commented.</t4090>
<t4091>And I thought about my Margo, Lacey's Margo, Mrs. Spiegelman's Margo, and all of us watching her image in a different mirror from a house of mirrors.</t4091> <t4092>I was going to say something, but Lacey's open mouth opened completely and she rested her head on the cold bathroom tiles, asleep.</t4092>
<t4093>I didn't decide to wake her up until two people entered the bathroom to pee.</t4093> <t4094>It was almost five in the morning and I had to take Ben to his house.</t4094>
<t4095>—Lace, wake up —I said, touching her sandal with my shoe.</t4095>
<t4096>He moved his head.</t4096>
<t4097>—I like being called that —he told me—.</t4097> <t4098>Do you know that right now you are my best friend?</t4098>
<t4099>—I'm very glad —I replied, although I was drunk and tired, and I was lying—.</t4099> <t4100>Look, we're both going to go up, and if anyone says anything about you, I'll defend your honor.</t4100>
<t4101>—Okay —he told me.</t4101>
<t4102>So we went up together.</t4102>
<t4103>The party had dispersed a bit, but there were still several baseball players, including Jase, on top of the beer barrel.</t4103> <t4104>Most were sleeping in sleeping bags scattered on the floor.</t4104> <t4105>There were several crammed onto a sofa bed.</t4105> <t4106>Angela and Radar were lying together on a loveseat.</t4106> <t4107>Radar's legs were hanging off one side.</t4107> <t4108>They were going to stay the night.</t4108>
<t4109>I was about to ask the guys by the barrel if they had seen Ben when he ran into the room.</t4109> <t4110>He was wearing a blue baby hat on his head and wielding a sword made of eight empty cans of Milwaukee’s Best Light, which I assumed he had glued together.</t4110>
<t4111>—I SAW YOU! —shouted Ben, pointing the sword at me—.</t4111> <t4112>I HAVE SPOTTED QUENTIN JACOBSEN!</t4112> <t4113>YES! Come here! Kneel!</t4113>
<t4114>—What? Ben, calm down.</t4114>
<t4115>—ON YOUR KNEES!</t4115>
<t4116>I obediently knelt down and looked at him.</t4116>
<t4117>He lifted the sword made of beer cans and tapped me on each shoulder.</t4117>
<t4118>—By the power of the sword made of glued beer cans, I hereby name you my driver.</t4118>
<t4119>—Thank you —I said—.</t4119> <t4120>Don't puke in the car.</t4120>
<t4121>—YES! —he shouted.</t4121>
<t4122>And when I tried to get up, he pushed me down with his free hand and once again passed the sword made of beer cans over my shoulders.</t4122>
<t4123>—By the power of the sword of beer cans, I hereby declare that at the graduation you shall not wear clothes under the gown.</t4123>
<t4124>—What?</t4124>
<t4125>I got up.</t4125>
<t4126>—YES! Radar, you and me!</t4126> <t4127>Naked under the gown!</t4127> <t4128>At graduation!</t4128> <t4129>It will be incredible!</t4129>
<t4130>—Well —I told him—, it will be very erotic.</t4130>
<t4131>—YES! —he answered me—.</t4131> <t4132>Swear that you will do it!</t4132> <t4133>I've already gotten Radar to swear it.</t4133> <t4134>RADAR, YOU SWORE IT, DIDN'T YOU?</t4134>
<t4135>Radar slightly turned his head and opened his eyes a little.</t4135>
<t4136>—I have sworn it —he murmured.</t4136>
<t4137>—Well, then I swear it too —I told him.</t4137>
<t4138>—YES! —And he turned to Lacey—: I love you.</t4138>
<t4139>—I love you too, Ben.</t4139>
<t4140>—No, I love you.</t4140> <t4141>Not like a sister loves her brother nor like a friend loves a friend.</t4141> <t4142>I love you like a completely drunk guy loves the best girl in the world.</t4142>
<t4143>He smiled.</t4143>
<t4144>I took a step forward with the intention of preventing him from continuing to make a fool of himself and placed a hand on his shoulder.</t4144>
<t4145>—If we have to be at your house by six, we should be heading out —I told him.</t4145>
<t4146>—Okay —he replied to me—.</t4146> <t4147>I'm going to thank Becca for this incredible party.</t4147>
<t4148>Lacey and I followed him downstairs, where he opened the door to Becca's room and said:</t4148>
<t4149>—Your party was awesome!</t4149> <t4150>Even though you suck!</t4150> <t4151>Your heart doesn't pump blood, but shit.</t4151> <t4152>But thanks for the beer.</t4152>
<t4153>Becca was alone, lying on top of the bedspread and staring at the ceiling.</t4153> <t4154>She didn't even look at Ben.</t4154> <t4155>She merely murmured:</t4155>
<t4156>—Ugh, go to hell, idiot.</t4156> <t4157>I hope your partner gives you crabs.</t4157>
<t4158>—Delighted to talk to you —Ben replied without a hint of irony.</t4158>
<t4159>And he closed the door.</t4159> <t4160>I think he hadn't even realized that they had just insulted him.</t4160>
<t4161>We went back up and headed to the door.</t4161>
<t4162>—Ben —I told him—, you're going to have to leave the sword here.</t4162>
<t4163>—Okay —he replied to me.</t4163>
<t4164>I grabbed the end of the sword and pulled, but Ben refused to let it go.</t4164> <t4165>I was about to start yelling at him that he was a worthless drunk when I realized that I couldn't let go of the sword.</t4165>
<t4166>—Ben, have you stuck the sword to your hand? —Lacey asked him, laughing.</t4166>
<t4167>—Yes —Ben replied—, I have glued it with Super Glue.</t4167> <t4168>That way, no one will steal it from me.</t4168>
<t4169>—Well thought out —said Lacey, impassively.</t4169>
<t4170>Lacey and I managed to remove all the cans except the one that was stuck to Ben's hand.</t4170> <t4171>No matter how hard he pulled, his hand followed, as if the can were the string and his hand the puppet.</t4171>
<t4172>—We have to go —said Lacey finally.</t4172>
<t4173>And we left.</t4173> <t4174>We sat Ben in the back seat and fastened his seatbelt.</t4174> <t4175>Lacey sat next to him because "this way I can make sure he doesn't throw up, hit himself with the beer can, and kill himself, or something like that."</t4175>
<t4176>But he was so out of it that Lacey had no problem talking to me about him.</t4176>
<t4177>—I have something to say about insistence, you know? —he told me as we drove down the highway—.</t4177> <t4178>Well, I know he insists too much, but why would that be bad?</t4178> <t4179>And besides, he's very sweet, isn't he?</t4179>
<t4180>—I suppose —I replied to him.</t4180>
<t4181>Ben's head hung as if it were not attached to his spine.</t4181> <t4182>It didn't seem particularly sweet to me, but oh well.</t4182>
<t4183>I first took Lacey to the other end of Jefferson Park.</t4183> <t4184>When Lacey leaned in and gave him a peck, he perked up enough to murmur, "Yes."</t4184>
<t4185>Lacey approached the driver's door on her way home.</t4185>
<t4186>—Thank you —he said to me.</t4186>
<t4187>I nodded.</t4187>
<t4188>I crossed the housing development.</t4188> <t4189>It was no longer night, but it still hadn't dawned.</t4189> <t4190>Ben was snoring softly in the back seat.</t4190> <t4191>I parked in front of his house, got out of the car, opened the sliding door of the minivan, and unbuckled his seatbelt.</t4191>
<t4192>—Time to go home, Benners.</t4192>
<t4193>He sniffed, moved his head, and woke up.</t4193> <t4194>He raised his hands to rub his eyes and seemed surprised to see a can of Milwaukee’s Best Light stuck to his hand.</t4194> <t4195>He tried to close his fist and dent the can a bit, but he couldn't tear it off.</t4195> <t4196>He looked at it for a minute and shook his head.</t4196>
<t4197>"The Beast is stuck to me," he observed.</t4197>
<t4198>He jumped out of the car and staggered along the sidewalk to his house.</t4198> <t4199>When he reached the porch, he turned around smiling.</t4199> <t4200>I waved at him.</t4200> <t4201>The beer waved back at me.</t4201>
<t4202>14</t4202>
<t4203>I slept for a few hours and then spent the morning carefully reading the travel guides I had found the day before.</t4203> <t4204>I waited until twelve to call Ben and Radar.</t4204> <t4205>I called Ben first.</t4205>
<t4206>—Good morning, Your Honor —I said to him.</t4206>
<t4207>—Oh, my God —said Ben in a tone that exuded the most abject misery—.</t4207> <t4208>Oh, little Jesus of my life, come to console your brother Ben.</t4208> <t4209>Oh, Lord, fill me with your grace.</t4209>
<t4210>—I have a ton of news about Margo —I told him excitedly—, so you have to come.</t4210> <t4211>I'm going to call Radar too.</t4211>
<t4212>Ben didn't seem to have heard me.</t4212>
<t4213>—Hey, how is it possible that when my mother entered my room this morning at nine, and I stretched my arms, we discovered a beer can stuck to my hand?</t4213>
<t4214>—You glued a bunch of beer cans together to make a sword, and then you glued it to your hand.</t4214>
<t4215>—Oh, yes.</t4215> <t4216>The beer sword.</t4216> <t4217>It rings a bell.</t4217>
<t4218>—Ben, come over here.</t4218>
<t4219>—Colleague, I'm feeling like crap.</t4219>
<t4220>—Then I will stop by your house.</t4220> <t4221>What time?</t4221>
<t4222>—Colleague, you can't come.</t4222> <t4223>I have to sleep ten thousand hours.</t4223> <t4224>I have to drink ten thousand liters of water and take ten thousand ibuprofens.</t4224> <t4225>I'll see you tomorrow at the institute.</t4225>
<t4226>I took a deep breath and tried not to look disappointed.</t4226>
<t4227>—I crossed central Florida in the middle of the night to arrive sober at the drunkest party in the world and leave your fat ass at home, and it's…</t4227>
<t4228>I would have kept talking, but I realized that Ben had hung up.</t4228> <t4229>He had hung up on me.</t4229> <t4230>Asshole.</t4230>
<t4231>As time went by, I was getting more and more pissed off.</t4231> <t4232>One thing was that Margo didn't give a damn about him, but the truth was that Ben didn't give a damn about me either.</t4232> <t4233>Maybe our friendship had always been out of convenience, because he didn't have anyone better to play video games with.</t4233> <t4234>But from then on, he didn't have to be nice to me or care about the things that mattered to me, because he had Jase Worthington.</t4234> <t4235>He held the school record for keg stand.</t4235> <t4236>He had gone to the dance with a hot chick.</t4236> <t4237>He had taken the first opportunity to switch to the group of bland assholes.</t4237>
<t4238>Five minutes after he hung up on me, I called him back on his cell phone.</t4238> <t4239>Since he didn't answer, I left him a message: "Do you want to be cool like Chuck, Bloody Ben?</t4239> <t4240>Is that what you've always wanted?</t4240> <t4241>Well, congratulations.</t4241> <t4242>You've achieved it.</t4242> <t4243>And you deserve it because you're a piece of shit.</t4243> <t4244>No need to call me back."</t4244>
<t4245>Then I called Radar.</t4245>
<t4246>—Hello —I said to him.</t4246>
<t4247>—Hello —he/she answered me—.</t4247> <t4248>I just puked in the shower.</t4248> <t4249>Can I call you later?</t4249>
<t4250>—Sure —I said, trying not to seem angry.</t4250>
<t4251>I just wanted someone to help me analyze Margo's world.</t4251> <t4252>But Radar wasn't Ben.</t4252> <t4253>He called me two minutes later.</t4253>
<t4254>—It was so disgusting that I threw up while cleaning it, and then, while cleaning it a second time, I threw up again.</t4254> <t4255>It's like a machine that doesn't stop.</t4255> <t4256>If I keep eating, I could spend the rest of my life throwing up.</t4256>
<t4257>—Can you come over? Or should I come by your house?</t4257>
<t4258>—Yes, of course.</t4258> <t4259>What's going on?</t4259>
<t4260>—Margo was alive in the abandoned mall for at least one night after she disappeared.</t4260>
<t4261>—I'm on my way.</t4261> <t4262>Four minutes.</t4262>
<t4263>Radar appeared by my window after exactly four minutes.</t4263>
<t4264>—Just so you know, I'm pissed off at Ben —I told him while climbing.</t4264>
<t4265>—I'm too hungover to mediate between you —he answered me in a calm tone.</t4265> <t4266>He lay down on the bed, with his eyes half-closed, and rubbed his nearly shaved hair—.</t4266> <t4267>It's like a lightning bolt hit me.</t4267> <t4268>—He sighed—.</t4268> <t4269>Well, catch me up.</t4269>
<t4270>I sat in the desk chair and told Radar about my night in the building Margo had passed through, trying not to leave out any significant details.</t4270> <t4271>I knew that Radar was better than me with puzzles, so I hoped he would assemble the pieces of this one.</t4271>
<t4272>He didn't say anything until I mentioned:</t4272>
<t4273>—And then Ben called me and I went to the party.</t4273>
<t4274>—Do you have that book, the one with the folded corners? —he asked me.</t4274>
<t4275>I got up, searched for it with my hand under the bed, and took it out.</t4275> <t4276>Radar picked it up, squinted his eyes due to the headache, and flipped through it.</t4276>
<t4277>—Write this down —he told me—: Omaha, Nebraska.</t4277> <t4278>Sac City, Iowa.</t4278> <t4279>Alexandria, Indiana.</t4279> <t4280>Darwin, Minnesota.</t4280> <t4281>Hollywood, California.</t4281> <t4282>Alliance, Nebraska.</t4282> <t4283>That's it.</t4283> <t4284>These are the places that Margo —well, or whoever read this book— found interesting.</t4284> <t4285>—He stood up, lifted me from the chair, and turned towards the computer.</t4285> <t4286>Radar had an incredible talent for continuing to talk while typing—.</t4286> <t4287>There is a group of maps that allows you to enter multiple destinations and offers you various routes.</t4287> <t4288>I don't think Margo knew about the program, but I want to take a look.</t4288>
<t4289>—How do you know all that crap? —I asked him.</t4289>
<t4290>—Ugh, remember that I spend my entire life on the Omnictionary.</t4290> <t4291>In the hour since I got home this morning and got into the shower, I have completely rewritten the page on abyssal fish Lophiiformes.</t4291> <t4292>I have a problem.</t4292> <t4293>Okay, look at this.</t4293>
<t4294>I leaned over and saw several routes drawn on a map of the United States.</t4294> <t4295>They all started in Orlando and ended in Hollywood, California.</t4295>
<t4296>—Will she be in Los Angeles? —suggested Radar.</t4296>
<t4297>—It could be —I replied—.</t4297> <t4298>But there is no way to know their route.</t4298>
<t4299>—True.</t4299> <t4300>And no other clue points to Los Angeles.</t4300> <t4301>What she told Jase points to New York.</t4301> <t4302>The "you will go to paper towns and never come back" seems to point to a pseudo-vision of this area.</t4302> <t4303>The nail polish, doesn't it also suggest that maybe she's still around here?</t4303> <t4304>I think we just need to add the location of the world's largest popcorn ball to our list of possible locations for Margo.</t4304>
<t4305>—The journey would coincide with one of Whitman's quotes: "The journey I have undertaken is eternal."</t4305>
<t4306>Radar remained hunched over the computer, and I went to sit on the bed.</t4306>
<t4307>—Hey, can you print a map of the United States so I can mark the points? —I asked him.</t4307>
<t4308>—I can mark them here.</t4308>
<t4309>—Yeah, but I would like to have the map in sight.</t4309>
<t4310>The printer started up after two seconds, and I hung the map of the United States next to the one of the pseudovisions.</t4310> <t4311>I stuck a thumbtack in each of the six places that Margo (or someone) had marked in the book.</t4311> <t4312>I tried to look at them as if they formed a constellation, to see if they made a shape or a letter, but I saw nothing.</t4312> <t4313>The distribution was completely random, as if she had blindfolded herself and thrown darts at the map.</t4313>
<t4314>I sighed.</t4314>
<t4315>—You know what would be nice? —Radar asked me—.</t4315> <t4316>Finding some proof that she checked her email or anything else on the internet.</t4316> <t4317>I look for her every day.</t4317> <t4318>I have an alert in case she logs into Omnictionary with her username.</t4318> <t4319>And I track the IPs of those who search for the words "paper towns."</t4319> <t4320>It's incredibly frustrating.</t4320>
<t4321>—I didn't know you were doing so many things —I said to him.</t4321>
<t4322>—Yes, well, I just do what I would like others to do for me.</t4322> <t4323>I know she wasn't my friend, but she deserves to be found, you know?</t4323>
<t4324>—Unless you don't want to —I said to him.</t4324>
<t4325>—Yes, I suppose it is possible.</t4325> <t4326>Everything is possible.</t4326>
<t4327>I nodded.</t4327>
<t4328>—In the end —he continued saying—, can we move on to video games?</t4328>
<t4329>—The truth is that I'm not in the mood.</t4329>
<t4330>—Well, shall we call Ben?</t4330>
<t4331>—No.</t4331> <t4332>Ben is an asshole.</t4332>
<t4333>Radar looked at me out of the corner of his eye.</t4333>
<t4334>—Of course.</t4334> <t4335>Do you know what your problem is, Quentin?</t4335> <t4336>You always expect people not to be who they are.</t4336> <t4337>I mean, I could hate you for always being late, for only caring about Margo Roth Spiegelman, and for never asking me how things are going with my girlfriend… but I don't give a damn, man, because that's just how you are.</t4337> <t4338>My parents have a ton of black Santa Clauses, but it's okay.</t4338> <t4339>That's just how they are.</t4339> <t4340>Sometimes I'm so obsessed with a website that I don't answer when my friends or my girlfriend call me, and that's okay too.</t4340> <t4341>That's just how I am.</t4341> <t4342>You appreciate me anyway.</t4342> <t4343>And I appreciate you.</t4343> <t4344>You're funny and smart, and it's true that you show up late, but in the end, you always show up.</t4344>
<t4345>—Thank you.</t4345>
<t4346>—Yes, well, actually I wasn't complimenting you.</t4346> <t4347>I'm just saying that you need to stop thinking that Ben should be like you, and Ben needs to stop thinking that you should be like him, and let's see if you both calm down for once.</t4347>
<t4348>—Very well —I finally said.</t4348>
<t4349>And I called Ben.</t4349> <t4350>The news that Radar was at my house and wanted to play video games made him miraculously recover from his hangover.</t4350>
<t4351>—Well —I said after hanging up—, how's Angela?</t4351>
<t4352>Radar laughed.</t4352>
<t4353>—Very well, uncle.</t4353> <t4354>It is very well.</t4354> <t4355>Thank you for asking.</t4355>
<t4356>—Are you still a virgin? —I asked her.</t4356>
<t4357>—I don't want to be indiscreet, but yes.</t4357> <t4358>Ugh, and this morning we had our first argument.</t4358> <t4359>We went to have breakfast at Waffle House and he started saying that Black Santa Clauses are fantastic, that my parents are great for collecting them, because it's important not to take for granted that all the cool people in our culture, like God and Santa Claus, are white, and that Black Santa Clauses empower the entire African American community.</t4359>
<t4360>—The truth is that I think I agree with her —I told him.</t4360>
<t4361>—Yes, well, as an idea it's fine, but it turns out to be nonsense.</t4361> <t4362>They don't intend to expand the dogma of a black Santa Claus.</t4362> <t4363>If that were the case, they would make black Santa Clauses.</t4363> <t4364>But what they do is try to buy all the world's reserves.</t4364> <t4365>In Pittsburgh, there's an old man who has the second largest collection in the world, and they always try to buy it from him.</t4365>
<t4366>Ben spoke from the door.</t4366> <t4367>Apparently, he had been there for a while.</t4367>
<t4368>—Radar, the fact that you haven't managed to hook up with that chick is the greatest human tragedy of our time.</t4368>
<t4369>—What's up, Ben? —I said to him.</t4369>
<t4370>—Thanks for taking me home last night, buddy.</t4370>
<t4371>15</t4371>
<t4372>Although there was only one week left until the final exams, I spent Monday afternoon reading "Song of Myself."</t4372> <t4373>I wanted to go to the last two pseudovisions, but Ben needed his car.</t4373> <t4374>I was no longer looking for clues in the poem as much as I was mostly trying to find Margo herself.</t4374> <t4375>This time I had read about half of "Song of Myself" when I came across another part that I found myself reading and rereading.</t4375>
<t4376>“Now I will do nothing but listen,” writes Whitman.</t4376> <t4377>And on the next two pages, he only listens: the steam whistle, the sound of the human voice, the opera chorus…</t4377> <t4378>He sits on the grass and lets the sound penetrate his body.</t4378> <t4379>And that is what I was also trying to do, I suppose: to listen to all the little sounds of Margo, because before any of them could make sense, they had to be listened to.</t4379> <t4380>For a long time, I had not really listened to Margo—I had seen her shouting and thought she was laughing—and then I discovered that this was what I had to do.</t4380> <t4381>To try, even when separated by a great distance, to listen to her opera.</t4381>
<t4382>Since I couldn't hear Margo, at least I could hear what she had once heard, so I downloaded the Woody Guthrie cover album.</t4382> <t4383>I sat in front of the computer, with my eyes closed and my elbows on the table, and listened to a voice singing in a minor key.</t4383> <t4384>I tried to listen, in a song I hadn't heard before, to the voice that after twelve days was hard for me to remember.</t4384>
<t4385>I was still listening, at that moment another of his favorites, Bob Dylan, when my mother arrived home.</t4385>
<t4386>—Dad will arrive late —she told me from the other side of the closed door—.</t4386> <t4387>I was thinking of making turkey burgers.</t4387>
<t4388>—Sounds good —I replied.</t4388>
<t4389>I closed my eyes again and listened to the music.</t4389> <t4390>I didn't get up from the chair until my father called me for dinner, an album and a half later.</t4390>
<t4391>During dinner, my parents talked about Middle Eastern politics.</t4391> <t4392>Although they were in complete agreement, they were yelling at the top of their lungs, saying that so-and-so was a liar, that so-and-so was a liar and a thief, and that almost all of them should resign.</t4392> <t4393>I focused on the turkey burger, which was delicious, drenched in ketchup and topped with fried onions.</t4393>
<t4394>—Well, that's enough —said my mother after a while—.</t4394> <t4395>Quentin, how was your day?</t4395>
<t4396>—Very well —I replied—.</t4396> <t4397>Preparing for the final exams, I suppose.</t4397>
<t4398>—I can't believe it's your last week of classes —said my father—.</t4398> <t4399>It seems like it was just yesterday…</t4399>
<t4400>—Yes —said my mother.</t4400>
<t4401>In my head, a voice said: ATTENTION NOSTALGIA ALERT ATTENTION ATTENTION ATTENTION.</t4401> <t4402>My parents are good people, but prone to bouts of immense sentimentalism.</t4402>
<t4403>—We are very proud of you —said my mother—, but, God, we will miss you next fall.</t4403>
<t4404>—Yes, well, don't speak too soon.</t4404> <t4405>I can still fail literature.</t4405>
<t4406>My mother laughed and then said:</t4406>
<t4407>—Ah, guess who I saw yesterday at the Young Men's Christian Association.</t4407> <t4408>Betty Parson.</t4408> <t4409>She told me that Chuck is going to the University of Georgia in the fall.</t4409> <t4410>I was happy for him.</t4410> <t4411>He has always struggled a lot.</t4411>
<t4412>—He's an asshole —I said.</t4412>
<t4413>—Well —said my father—, he was a bully.</t4413> <t4414>And his behavior was deplorable.</t4414>
<t4415>Typical of my parents.</t4415> <t4416>For them, no one was simply an asshole.</t4416> <t4417>People always had something going on that went beyond being a jerk: they had socialization disorders, or borderline personality disorder, or whatever.</t4417>
<t4418>My mother took the thread.</t4418>
<t4419>—But Chuck has learning difficulties.</t4419> <t4420>He has all kinds of problems... like anyone else.</t4420> <t4421>I know it's impossible for you to see your classmates that way, but when you get older, you start to see them (the bad kids, the good ones, and everyone) as people.</t4421> <t4422>They are just people who deserve affection.</t4422> <t4423>Different levels of illness, different levels of neurosis, and different levels of self-actualization.</t4423> <t4424>But, look, I've always liked Betty and I've always had hopes for Chuck.</t4424> <t4425>So it's okay for him to go to college, don't you think, Quentin?</t4425>
<t4426>—Honestly, mom, I don't care in the slightest.</t4426>
<t4427>But I thought that if everyone is a person, why did my parents hate the politicians of Israel and Palestine so much?</t4427> <t4428>They didn't talk about them as if they were people.</t4428>
<t4429>My father finished chewing something, put the fork on the table, and looked at me.</t4429>
<t4430>—The longer I work at my job —he told me—, the more I realize that human beings lack good mirrors.</t4430> <t4431>It is very difficult for anyone to show us how we are seen, and for us to show anyone how we feel.</t4431>
<t4432>—Very beautiful —said my mother.</t4432> <t4433>I liked that they liked each other—.</t4433> <t4434>But, deep down, isn't that also what makes it so difficult for us to understand that others are human beings exactly like us?</t4434> <t4435>We idealize them as gods or discard them as animals.</t4435>
<t4436>—True.</t4436> <t4437>Consciousness also closes windows.</t4437> <t4438>I think I had never thought about it in this sense.</t4438>
<t4439>I leaned back in the chair and listened.</t4439> <t4440>I heard things about my mother, about windows, and about mirrors.</t4440> <t4441>Chuck Parson was a person.</t4441> <t4442>Like me.</t4442> <t4443>Margo Roth Spiegelman was also a person.</t4443> <t4444>I had never thought of her that way, to be honest.</t4444> <t4445>In all my previous speculations, there was a flaw.</t4445> <t4446>Always — not just since she had left, but for the past ten years — I had imagined her without listening to her, without knowing that her window was as closed as mine.</t4446> <t4447>And that's why I didn't imagine her as a person who could be afraid, who could feel isolated in a room full of people, who could be embarrassed by her record collection because it was too personal to share.</t4447> <t4448>Someone who might read travel books to escape because she had to live in a city from which so many people escape.</t4448> <t4449>Someone who — since no one thought she was a person — had no one to talk to.</t4449>
<t4450>And suddenly I understood how Margo Roth Spiegelman felt when she wasn't being Margo Roth Spiegelman: empty.</t4450> <t4451>She felt surrounded by an insurmountable wall.</t4451> <t4452>I thought of her sleeping on the carpet with only that jagged piece of sky above her head.</t4452> <t4453>Maybe she felt comfortable there because the person Margo always lived like that, in an abandoned room, with the windows covered, where light only came in through the holes in the ceiling.</t4453> <t4454>Yes.</t4454> <t4455>The fundamental mistake I had always made —and to be fair, she always led me to make— was this: Margo was not a miracle.</t4455> <t4456>She was not an adventure.</t4456> <t4457>She was not something perfect and precious.</t4457> <t4458>She was a girl.</t4458>
<t4459>16</t4459>
<t4460>The clock was always relentless, but feeling that I was close to untying the knots made Tuesday seem to have stopped.</t4460> <t4461>We had decided to go to the abandoned mall right after class, so the wait became unbearable for me.</t4461> <t4462>When the bell finally rang, after literature class, I ran downstairs, and I was almost at the door when I realized that we couldn't leave until Ben and Radar had finished rehearsal.</t4462> <t4463>I sat down to wait for them and took out from my backpack a slice of pizza wrapped in paper napkins that I had left over from lunch.</t4463> <t4464>I hadn't eaten even a quarter of it when Lacey Pemberton sat down next to me.</t4464> <t4465>I offered her a piece, but she said no.</t4465>
<t4466>We are talking about Margo, of course.</t4466> <t4467>The problem we shared.</t4467>
<t4468>—What I need to find out is the place —I said, wiping the pizza oil on my pants—.</t4468> <t4469>But I don't even know if I'm on the right track with the pseudovisions.</t4469> <t4470>Sometimes I think we are completely off track.</t4470>
<t4471>—Yes, I don't know.</t4471> <t4472>Honestly, putting everything else aside, I like discovering things about her.</t4472> <t4473>I mean, things I didn't know.</t4473> <t4474>I had no idea who she really was.</t4474> <t4475>The truth is that I always thought of her as a pretty and crazy friend who does all kinds of beautiful craziness.</t4475>
<t4476>—True, but he wouldn't do those things willingly —I told him—.</t4476> <t4477>I mean that all his adventures had a certain…</t4477> <t4478>I don't know.</t4478>
<t4479>—Elegance —added Lacey—.</t4479> <t4480>She is the only completely elegant young person I know.</t4480>
<t4481>—Yes.</t4481>
<t4482>—That's why it's hard for me to imagine her in a filthy, dark, and dusty room.</t4482>
<t4483>—Yes —I told him—.</t4483> <t4484>And with rats.</t4484>
<t4485>Lacey brought her knees to her chest and adopted the fetal position.</t4485>
<t4486>—How disgusting.</t4486> <t4487>That's not like Margo either.</t4487>
<t4488>I don't know how Lacey claimed the front passenger seat, even though she was the shortest of all.</t4488> <t4489>Ben was driving.</t4489> <t4490>I sighed loudly when Radar, who was sitting next to me, took out his pocket computer and started working on the Omnictionary.</t4490>
<t4491>—I am deleting the pranks from Chuck Norris's page —he told me—.</t4491> <t4492>For example, although I agree that he is a specialist in roundhouse kicks, I don't think it's correct to say: "Chuck Norris's tears cure cancer, but unfortunately he has never cried."</t4492> <t4493>But, well, deleting the pranks only requires four percent of my brain.</t4493>
<t4494>I understood that Radar was trying to make me laugh, but I only wanted to talk about one thing.</t4494>
<t4495>—I'm not convinced that she's in a pseudovision.</t4495> <t4496>Maybe she wasn't even referring to that with the "paper towns," you know?</t4496> <t4497>We have many clues about places, but nothing concrete.</t4497>
<t4498>Radar lifted his gaze for a second and then lowered it back to the screen.</t4498>
<t4499>—Personally, I think she's far away, on a ridiculous tour of tourist spots and mistakenly believing that she has left enough clues to be found.</t4499> <t4500>So I think right now she's in Omaha, Nebraska, looking at the world's largest ball of stamps, or in Minnesota, checking out the world's largest ball of twine.</t4500>
<t4501>—So, do you think Margo is on a tour around the country looking for the world's biggest balls?</t4501> <t4502>—asked Ben, looking in the rearview mirror.</t4502>
<t4503>Radar nodded.</t4503>
<t4504>—Well —Ben continued—, someone should tell him to come back home, because right here in Orlando, Florida, he can find the biggest balls in the world.</t4504> <t4505>They are in a special display case known as "my scrotum."</t4505>
<t4506>Radar laughed.</t4506>
<t4507>—I'm serious —Ben continued saying—.</t4507> <t4508>My balls are so big that, when you order fries at McDonald's, you can choose from four sizes: small, medium, large, and my balls.</t4508>
<t4509>Lacey gave him a look and said to him:</t4509>
<t4510>—Out of place comment.</t4510>
<t4511>—Sorry —murmured Ben—.</t4511> <t4512>I think Margo is in Orlando.</t4512> <t4513>Watching us look for her.</t4513> <t4514>And watching that her parents aren't looking for her.</t4514>
<t4515>—I still bet on New York —said Lacey.</t4515>
<t4516>—Everything is possible —I replied.</t4516>
<t4517>A Margo for each one of us... and each one was more a mirror than a window.</t4517>
<t4518>The shopping center looked the same as it did a couple of days before.</t4518> <t4519>Ben parked and I took them to the office through the door that opened by pushing.</t4519>
<t4520>—Don't turn on the lanterns yet —I told them when we were all inside—.</t4520> <t4521>Wait until your eyes get used to the darkness.</t4521> <t4522>—I felt some nails running down my arm—.</t4522> <t4523>Calm down, Lace.</t4523>
<t4524>—Oops —said Lacey—.</t4524> <t4525>I used the wrong arm.</t4525>
<t4526>I understood that he was looking for Ben's.</t4526>
<t4527>Little by little, the room began to take shape in a blurry gray.</t4527> <t4528>I saw the tables lined up, still waiting for the employees.</t4528> <t4529>I turned on the flashlight, and the others turned on theirs as well.</t4529> <t4530>Ben and Lacey headed together towards the Troll Hole to inspect the other rooms.</t4530> <t4531>Radar came with me to Margo's desk.</t4531> <t4532>He knelt down to closely observe the calendar frozen in the month of June.</t4532>
<t4533>I was leaning by his side when I heard quick steps approaching us.</t4533>
<t4534>—People —murmured Ben, crouching behind Margo's table and pulling Lacey.</t4534>
<t4535>—What? Where?</t4535>
<t4536>—In the other room! —he said—.</t4536> <t4537>They are wearing masks.</t4537> <t4538>They look like cops.</t4538> <t4539>Let's go.</t4539>
<t4540>Radar focused his flashlight towards the Troll Hole, but Ben knocked it down with a swipe.</t4540>
<t4541>—We have to get out of here!</t4541>
<t4542>Lacey was staring at me with wide eyes, probably a little angry, because I had promised her that she wouldn't be in danger, and it didn't seem true.</t4542>
<t4543>—Okay —I whispered—.</t4543> <t4544>Okay, everyone out, through the door.</t4544> <t4545>Calmly but quickly.</t4545>
<t4546>I had just taken a step when I heard a booming voice shouting: WHO GOES THERE?</t4546>
<t4547>Shit.</t4547>
<t4548>—Ahem —I said—, we just came to take a look.</t4548>
<t4549>What an outlandish nonsense.</t4549> <t4550>A white light coming from the Troll Hole blinded me.</t4550> <t4551>It could have been God himself.</t4551>
<t4552>—What are your intentions?</t4552>
<t4553>The voice slightly imitated a British accent.</t4553>
<t4554>I observed Ben, who approached me.</t4554> <t4555>I felt better accompanied.</t4555>
<t4556>—We are investigating a disappearance —said Ben very confidently—.</t4556> <t4557>We weren't going to break anything.</t4557>
<t4558>The light moved away and I blinked until I saw three figures, all three wearing jeans, a t-shirt, and a mask with two round filters.</t4558> <t4559>One of them lifted the mask to their forehead and looked at us.</t4559> <t4560>I recognized the goatee and the large mouth.</t4560>
<t4561>—Gus? —said Lacey, standing up.</t4561>
<t4562>He was the SunTrust guard.</t4562>
<t4563>—Lacey Pemberton.</t4563> <t4564>For God's sake, what are you doing here?</t4564> <t4565>And without masks...</t4565> <t4566>There are tons of asbestos here.</t4566>
<t4567>—What are you doing here?</t4567>
<t4568>—Exploring —he replied.</t4568>
<t4569>Ben felt confident enough to approach the other two boys and extend his hand to them.</t4569> <t4570>They introduced themselves as As and the Carpenter.</t4570> <t4571>I would dare to assume that they were pseudonyms.</t4571>
<t4572>We took office chairs with wheels and sat down forming more or less a circle.</t4572>
<t4573>—Was it you who broke the plank? —asked Gus.</t4573>
<t4574>—Well, it was me —Ben explained to him.</t4574>
<t4575>—We sealed it with tape because we didn't want anyone else to enter.</t4575> <t4576>If from the road it looks like you can get in, a bunch of people who have no clue about exploring would come.</t4576> <t4577>Vagrants, crack addicts, and all that.</t4577>
<t4578>I took a step towards them.</t4578>
<t4579>—So you guys… well… did you know that Margo was here? —I asked.</t4579>
<t4580>Before Gus could answer, As spoke without removing the mask.</t4580> <t4581>His voice was slightly modulated, but it was easy to understand him.</t4581>
<t4582>—Uncle, Margo spent her life here.</t4582> <t4583>We only come a couple of times a year.</t4583> <t4584>There's asbestos and, well, it's nothing special.</t4584> <t4585>But surely we've seen her, I don't know, more than half the times we've come in the last two years.</t4585> <t4586>She was hot, huh?</t4586>
<t4587>—Was he? —asked Lacey with emphasis.</t4587>
<t4588>—He has escaped, hasn't he?</t4588>
<t4589>—What do you know about the matter? —Lacey asked them.</t4589>
<t4590>—Nothing, please.</t4590> <t4591>A couple of weeks ago I saw Margo with him —said Gus pointing at me—.</t4591> <t4592>And then they told me she had run away.</t4592> <t4593>A few days later it occurred to me that she might be here, so we came.</t4593>
<t4594>—I have never understood why he liked this place so much.</t4594> <t4595>There is hardly anything here —said the Carpenter—.</t4595> <t4596>Exploring here is no fun.</t4596>
<t4597>—What is this "exploring"? —asked Lacey to Gus.</t4597>
<t4598>—Urban exploration.</t4598> <t4599>We enter abandoned buildings, explore them, and take photos.</t4599> <t4600>We neither take nor leave anything.</t4600> <t4601>We are mere observers.</t4601>
<t4602>—It's a hobby —said As—.</t4602> <t4603>Gus used to let Margo join us in exploring when we were still in high school.</t4603>
<t4604>—He had a very good eye, even though he was only thirteen years old —said Gus—.</t4604> <t4605>He found a way to get into any place.</t4605> <t4606>Back then we did it occasionally, but now we go out about three times a week.</t4606> <t4607>There are places everywhere.</t4607> <t4608>In Clearwater, there is an abandoned psychiatric hospital.</t4608> <t4609>It's incredible.</t4609> <t4610>You can see where they used to tie up the crazies to give them electroshocks.</t4610> <t4611>And near here, to the west, there is an old jail.</t4611> <t4612>But Margo wasn't really into it.</t4612> <t4613>She liked to get in, but then she wanted to stay.</t4613>
<t4614>—Yeah, damn, it was a hassle —added As.</t4614>
<t4615>—He didn't even take photos —said the Carpenter—.</t4615> <t4616>He didn't look for things around.</t4616> <t4617>He just wanted to come in and sit down.</t4617> <t4618>Do you remember the black notebook?</t4618> <t4619>He would sit in a corner and write, as if he were at home doing homework or something like that.</t4619>
<t4620>—Honestly, she never understood what it was about —said Gus—.</t4620> <t4621>The adventure.</t4621> <t4622>In reality, she seemed quite depressed.</t4622>
<t4623>I wanted to let them keep talking, because I thought that everything they said would help me imagine Margo, but suddenly Lacey stood up and kicked her chair.</t4623>
<t4624>—And it never occurred to you to ask her why she was depressed? Or why she spent the day in these shithole dives?</t4624> <t4625>Have you never considered it?</t4625>
<t4626>He was in front of him, shouting at him from above, so Gus stood up as well.</t4626> <t4627>He was almost a handspan taller than her.</t4627>
<t4628>—For God's sake, someone calm this bitch down a bit —said the Carpenter.</t4628>
<t4629>—What did you say? —shouted Ben.</t4629>
<t4630>And before I realized what was happening, Ben shoved the Carpenter, who slipped clumsily from the chair and ended up on the floor.</t4630> <t4631>Ben straddled the guy and started hitting him, delivering strong slaps and punches to his mask.</t4631>
<t4632>—SHE IS NOT A BITCH!</t4632> <t4633>THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE!</t4633>
<t4634>I got up and grabbed Ben by one arm while Radar held him by the other.</t4634>
<t4635>—I'm very pissed off! —he shouted as we pulled him away—.</t4635> <t4636>I was having fun hitting that guy!</t4636> <t4637>I want to hit him again!</t4637>
<t4638>—Ben —I said, trying to appear calm, with the tone my mother usually uses—.</t4638> <t4639>Ben, that's enough.</t4639> <t4640>You've made your point clear.</t4640>
<t4641>Gus and As lifted the Carpenter.</t4641>
<t4642>—Fuck, we're getting out of here, alright?</t4642> <t4643>All yours.</t4643>
<t4644>He grabbed his photography equipment and the three of them ran out the back door.</t4644> <t4645>Lacey began to explain to me how she knew him.</t4645>
<t4646>—He was in the final year when we...</t4646>
<t4647>But I signaled with my hand to let it go.</t4647> <t4648>It didn't matter.</t4648>
<t4649>Radar knew what mattered.</t4649> <t4650>He immediately returned to the calendar and brought his eyes two centimeters from the paper.</t4650>
<t4651>—I think they didn't write anything on the May page —he said—.</t4651> <t4652>The paper is very thin and I don't see any marks.</t4652> <t4653>But I can't be sure.</t4653>
<t4654>He started looking for more clues and I saw Lacey's and Ben's flashlights going into a Troll Hole, but I stayed in the office imagining Margo.</t4654> <t4655>I thought of her going to abandoned buildings with those guys, four years older than her.</t4655> <t4656>That was the Margo I had seen.</t4656> <t4657>But the one who stayed in the buildings was not the Margo I had always imagined.</t4657> <t4658>While everyone else goes out to explore, take photos, and jump off the walls, Margo sits on the floor to write.</t4658>
<t4659>—Q! We have something! —shouted Ben from the door.</t4659>
<t4660>I wiped the sweat from my face with both sleeves and grabbed the table to stand up.</t4660> <t4661>I crossed the room, crawled through the Troll Hole, and headed towards the three lanterns that lined the wall above the rolled-up carpet.</t4661>
<t4662>—Look —said Ben, tracing a square on the wall with the flashlight—.</t4662> <t4663>Do you remember the little holes you told us about?</t4663>
<t4664>—Yes.</t4664>
<t4665>—There must have been things pinned here —said Ben—.</t4665> <t4666>From the space between the holes, we believe they were postcards or photos that he might have taken with him when he left.</t4666>
<t4667>—Yes, it could be —I replied to him—.</t4667> <t4668>I hope we find the notebook Gus talked about.</t4668>
<t4669>—Yes.</t4669> <t4670>When he said it, I remembered that notebook —said Lacey.</t4670> <t4671>The beam of my flashlight only illuminated her legs—.</t4671> <t4672>She always carried one with her.</t4672> <t4673>I never saw her writing in it, but I assumed it was a planner or something like that.</t4673> <t4674>Wow, I never asked her about that notebook.</t4674> <t4675>I got mad at Gus, who wasn't even her friend, but did I ever ask her anything?</t4675>
<t4676>—In any case, I wouldn't have answered you —I told him.</t4676>
<t4677>It wasn't honest to pretend that Margo hadn't participated in her own confusion.</t4677>
<t4678>We kept wandering around there for an hour, and just when I was convinced that we had made the trip in vain, my flashlight passed over the brochures that were arranged like a house the first time we entered.</t4678> <t4679>One of the brochures was from Grovepoint Acres.</t4679> <t4680>I spread out the others, holding my breath.</t4680> <t4681>I ran to get my backpack, which was next to the door, ran back with a pen and a notebook, and wrote down the names of all the developments that appeared in the brochures.</t4681> <t4682>I recognized one immediately: Collier Farms, one of the two developments on my list that I hadn't visited yet.</t4682> <t4683>I finished copying the names and put the notebook back in the backpack.</t4683> <t4684>Call me selfish, but if I found it, I preferred to do it alone.</t4684>
<t4685>17</t4685>
<t4686>As soon as my mother got home on Friday, I told her I was going to a concert with Radar, took the car, and headed to the outskirts of Seminole County to see Collier Farms.</t4686> <t4687>It turned out that all the other developments that appeared in the brochures existed, most of them north of the city.</t4687> <t4688>They had been completed a long time ago.</t4688>
<t4689>I only recognized the turnoff to Collier Farms because I had become an expert in spotting hard-to-see unpaved roads.</t4689> <t4690>But Collier Farms was different from the other pseudovisions I had visited.</t4690> <t4691>It was extremely neglected, as if it had been abandoned for fifty years.</t4691> <t4692>I didn't know if it was older than the others or if the low, swampy land had made everything grow faster, but as soon as I took the turnoff, it became impossible to keep going because the entire road was covered with thick bushes.</t4692>
<t4693>I got out of the car and continued on foot.</t4693> <t4694>The undergrowth scratched my calves, and with each step, my sneakers sank into the mud.</t4694> <t4695>I couldn't help but hope that I had set up a tent on some piece of ground a few meters above the rest so that the rainwater wouldn't stagnate.</t4695> <t4696>I walked slowly because there were more things to see than in any of the other pseudo-visions, more places to hide, and because I knew that this complex was directly related to the abandoned shopping mall.</t4696> <t4697>The ground was so full of undergrowth that I had to move very slowly through each new scene and check that all the places were big enough to fit a person.</t4697> <t4698>At the end of the street, I saw a blue and white cardboard box in the mud, and for a moment, it seemed like the same box of cereal bars I had found in the shopping mall.</t4698> <t4699>But no.</t4699> <t4700>It was the torn-up box of a twelve-pack of beers.</t4700> <t4701>I struggled back to the car and headed to a place called Logan Pines, further north.</t4701>
<t4702>It took me an hour to get there.</t4702> <t4703>I had left behind the Ocala National Forest, almost out of the Orlando metropolitan area, when Ben called me.</t4703>
<t4704>—What's happening?</t4704>
<t4705>—Have you been to those paper towns? —he asked me.</t4705>
<t4706>—Yes, I'm almost at the last one.</t4706> <t4707>I still haven't found anything.</t4707>
<t4708>—Hey, buddy, Radar's parents had to leave the city in a hurry.</t4708>
<t4709>—Is something wrong? —I asked him.</t4709>
<t4710>I knew that Radar's grandparents were very old and lived in a nursing home in Miami.</t4710>
<t4711>—Yes, listen to me: do you remember the guy from Pittsburgh who had the second largest collection in the world of Black Santas?</t4711>
<t4712>—Yes, and?</t4712>
<t4713>—He just kicked the bucket.</t4713>
<t4714>—You're joking.</t4714>
<t4715>—Colleague, I don't joke about the death of black Santa Claus collectors.</t4715> <t4716>The guy had a stroke, and the old folks from Radar are flying to Pennsylvania to try to buy his entire collection.</t4716> <t4717>So let's invite the gang.</t4717>
<t4718>—Who?</t4718>
<t4719>—You, Radar, and I.</t4719> <t4720>We are the hosts.</t4720>
<t4721>—I don't know —I told him.</t4721>
<t4722>We stayed silent for a moment, and then Ben called me by my full name.</t4722>
<t4723>—Quentin —he said to me—, I know you want to find her.</t4723> <t4724>I know it's the most important thing to you.</t4724> <t4725>Perfect.</t4725> <t4726>But we graduate next week.</t4726> <t4727>I'm not asking you to stop looking for her.</t4727> <t4728>I'm asking you to come to a party with your two best friends, whom you've known for half your life.</t4728> <t4729>I'm asking you to spend two or three hours drinking wine coolers like a sissy, and another two or three hours throwing up said coolers through your nose.</t4729> <t4730>And then you can continue wandering through abandoned neighborhoods.</t4730>
<t4731>It bothered me that Ben only wanted to talk about Margo when it was about an adventure that attracted him, that he thought I was wrong to focus more on her than on my friends, because she wasn't there, but they were.</t4731> <t4732>But Ben was Ben, as Radar had said.</t4732> <t4733>And, anyway, I had nothing else to look for after Logan Pines.</t4733>
<t4734>—I will go to this last one and then I will stop by Radar's house.</t4734>
<t4735>I had placed great hopes in Logan Pines because it was the last pseudovision in central Florida, or at least the last one I had heard of.</t4735> <t4736>But I didn't see any tents as I walked down its only dead-end street with the flashlight in my hand.</t4736> <t4737>No sign of a campfire.</t4737> <t4738>No food wrappers.</t4738> <t4739>No trace of people.</t4739> <t4740>No trace of Margo.</t4740> <t4741>At the end of the road, I found a concrete hole sunk into the ground, but nothing had been built on top of it.</t4741> <t4742>It was just the hole, like the open mouth of a dead person, surrounded by a tangle of brambles and weeds almost a meter high.</t4742> <t4743>I didn't understand why Margo would have wanted me to see these places.</t4743> <t4744>And if she had gone to the pseudovisions never to return, she knew of a place I hadn't discovered in my research.</t4744>
<t4745>It took me an hour and a half to get back to Jefferson Park.</t4745> <t4746>I parked the car at home, put on a polo shirt and my only decent jeans, walked down Jefferson Way to Jefferson Court, and then turned right onto Jefferson Road.</t4746> <t4747>On Jefferson Place, Radar's street, there were already several cars parked on both sides.</t4747> <t4748>It was only a quarter to nine.</t4748>
<t4749>I opened the door and found myself face to face with Radar, who was holding a bunch of black Santa Claus figurines made of plaster in his hands.</t4749>
<t4750>—I have to keep the prettiest ones —he told me—, just in case one of them breaks.</t4750>
<t4751>—Do you need help? —I asked him.</t4751>
<t4752>Radar pointed out the dining room to me with his head.</t4752> <t4753>On the tables on either side of the sofa, there were three sets of Russian dolls shaped like black Santa Clauses.</t4753> <t4754>As I nested some inside the others, I couldn't help but notice that they were actually very beautiful.</t4754> <t4755>They were hand-painted with great detail.</t4755> <t4756>Although I didn't tell Radar, because I feared he might beat me to death with the black Santa Claus lamp from the dining room.</t4756>
<t4757>I took the Russian dolls to the guest room, where Radar was carefully placing Santa Claus in a dresser.</t4757>
<t4758>—You know?</t4758> <t4759>When you see them all together, you wonder how we imagine our myths.</t4759>
<t4760>Radar looked at the ceiling.</t4760>
<t4761>—Yes, I find myself wondering how I imagine my myths every morning, when I'm eating my cereal with a damn black Santa Claus spoon.</t4761>
<t4762>I felt a hand rubbing my shoulder.</t4762> <t4763>It was Ben, who was moving his feet at full speed, as if he were about to pee himself.</t4763>
<t4764>—We kissed.</t4764> <t4765>Well, she kissed me.</t4765> <t4766>About ten minutes ago.</t4766> <t4767>On Radar's parents' bed.</t4767>
<t4768>—How disgusting! —exclaimed Radar—.</t4768> <t4769>Don't mess around in my parents' bed.</t4769>
<t4770>—Wow, I thought you were over that phase by now —I said to Ben—.</t4770> <t4771>Weren't you so cocky?</t4771>
<t4772>—Shut up, buddy.</t4772> <t4773>I'm terrified —he replied, looking at me with almost cross-eyed eyes—.</t4773> <t4774>I don't think this is very good.</t4774>
<t4775>—In what?</t4775>
<t4776>—Kissing.</t4776> <t4777>And well, she has kissed much more than I have in recent years.</t4777> <t4778>I don't want to kiss so badly that she leaves me.</t4778> <t4779>You are liked by girls —he told me, which was only true, and hopefully, if by "girls" he meant the girls in the band—.</t4779> <t4780>Buddy, I'm asking you for advice.</t4780>
<t4781>I was tempted to ask him about the endless lectures he gave us on the various ways to excite different bodies, but I limited myself to saying:</t4781>
<t4782>—As far as I know, there are two basic rules: 1) Don't bite anything without permission, and 2)</t4782> <t4783>The human tongue is like wasabi.</t4783> <t4784>It is very potent and should be used sparingly.</t4784>
<t4785>Suddenly, their eyes shone with panic.</t4785> <t4786>I made a face and said:</t4786>
<t4787>—It's behind me, isn't it?</t4787>
<t4788>—"The human tongue is like wasabi," —repeated Lacey in a deep and ridiculous voice that I hoped did not resemble mine.</t4788> <t4789>I turned around—.</t4789> <t4790>The truth is, I think Ben's tongue is like sunscreen.</t4790> <t4791>It's good for your health and you should apply it generously.</t4791>
<t4792>—I'm about to puke —said Radar.</t4792>
<t4793>—Lacey, you just made me lose the desire to keep talking —I added.</t4793>
<t4794>"I wish I could stop imagining it," replied Radar.</t4794>
<t4795>—The mere idea is so offensive that it is forbidden to say "Ben Starling's tongue" on TV —I said.</t4795>
<t4796>—The punishment for violating this rule is ten years in prison or a blowjob from Ben Starling —added Radar.</t4796>
<t4797>—Everyone… —I said.</t4797>
<t4798>—He prefers… —said Radar, smiling.</t4798>
<t4799>—The jail —we both said at the same time.</t4799>
<t4800>And then Lacey kissed Ben in front of us.</t4800>
<t4801>—My God —exclaimed Radar, passing his hands in front of his face—, My God, I have gone blind.</t4801> <t4802>I have gone blind.</t4802>
<t4803>—Enough, please —I begged—.</t4803> <t4804>You are bothering the black Santa Clauses.</t4804>
<t4805>The party ended with twenty people crammed into the living room on the second floor of Radar's house.</t4805> <t4806>I leaned against a wall, with my head just a few centimeters away from a black Santa Claus painted on velvet.</t4806> <t4807>People had crowded onto one of those modular sofas.</t4807> <t4808>Next to the TV, there was a fridge with beers, but no one was drinking.</t4808> <t4809>They were telling stories to each other.</t4809> <t4810>I had heard most of them —stories about the band, about Ben Starling, about first kisses— but Lacey hadn't, and they were still funny anyway.</t4810> <t4811>I stayed quite on the sidelines until Ben said:</t4811>
<t4812>—Q, how are we going to graduate?</t4812>
<t4813>—Without clothes under the toga —I replied, smiling.</t4813>
<t4814>—Yes!</t4814>
<t4815>Ben took a sip of his soda.</t4815>
<t4816>—I won't even bring clothes so I don't chicken out —said Radar.</t4816>
<t4817>—Me neither! Q, swear that you won't take any clothes.</t4817>
<t4818>I smiled.</t4818>
<t4819>—Jury remains —I told him.</t4819>
<t4820>—I'm in! —exclaimed our friend Frank.</t4820>
<t4821>And then the boys started to join the idea.</t4821> <t4822>For some reason, the girls resisted.</t4822>
<t4823>—Your refusal makes me question the meaning of our love —said Radar to Angela.</t4823>
<t4824>—You don't understand —commented Lacey—.</t4824> <t4825>It's not that we're scared.</t4825> <t4826>It's just that we've already chosen the dress.</t4826>
<t4827>—Exactly —said Angela pointing at Lacey.</t4827>
<t4828>—You better hope it's not windy —added Angela.</t4828>
<t4829>—I hope it is windy —said Ben—.</t4829> <t4830>The world's biggest balls benefit from fresh air.</t4830>
<t4831>Lacey, embarrassed, brought a hand to her face.</t4831>
<t4832>—You are a challenging boyfriend —she commented—.</t4832> <t4833>Rewarding, but challenging.</t4833>
<t4834>We laughed.</t4834>
<t4835>It was what I liked most about my friends, that we were content just sitting and telling stories.</t4835> <t4836>Window stories and mirror stories.</t4836> <t4837>I just listened.</t4837> <t4838>The stories I had in mind weren't as fun.</t4838>
<t4839>I couldn't help thinking that high school and everything else was coming to an end.</t4839> <t4840>I liked being somewhat apart from the sofas, observing them.</t4840> <t4841>I didn't mind that it was a bit sad.</t4841> <t4842>I just listened, letting all the joy and all the sadness of that ending swirl around me, each intensifying the other.</t4842> <t4843>Almost all the time it felt like my chest was going to explode, but it wasn't exactly an unpleasant sensation.</t4843>
<t4844>I left just before twelve.</t4844> <t4845>Some were going to stay until later, but I had to be home at that time, and besides, I didn't feel like staying.</t4845> <t4846>My mother was half asleep on the couch, but she perked up as soon as she saw me.</t4846>
<t4847>—Did you have a good time?</t4847>
<t4848>—Yes —I replied—.</t4848> <t4849>It has been a very quiet party.</t4849>
<t4850>—Like you —he told me, smiling.</t4850>
<t4851>That sentimental outburst seemed somewhat hilarious to me, but I didn't say anything.</t4851> <t4852>She stood up, pulled me, and gave me a kiss on the cheek.</t4852>
<t4853>—I really like being your mother —she told me.</t4853>
<t4854>—Thank you —I replied.</t4854>
<t4855>I got into bed with Whitman's book and flipped through the pages to the part I liked, where he dedicates himself to listening to opera and to people.</t4855>
<t4856>After listening to everything, he writes: "Angry and bitter waves cut me, I almost drown."</t4856> <t4857>I thought it was perfect.</t4857> <t4858>You listen to people to be able to imagine them, you hear all the terrible and wonderful things that people do to themselves and to others, but in the end, listening drowns you even more than the people you are trying to listen to.</t4858>
<t4859>Exploring pseudovisions and trying to listen to Margo doesn't fracture the case of Margo Roth Spiegelman as much as it fractures me.</t4859> <t4860>A few pages later —listening and drowning—.</t4860> <t4861>Whitman begins to write about the journeys he can take with his imagination, and lists all the places he can go while lying in the grass.</t4861> <t4862>“The palms of my hands encompass continents,” he writes.</t4862>
<t4863>I think about maps, about how as a child I would occasionally look at an atlas, and just observing it was like being somewhere else.</t4863> <t4864>That was what I had to do.</t4864> <t4865>I had to listen and imagine my way on its map.</t4865>
<t4866>But hadn't I tried?</t4866> <t4867>I looked up at the maps that were above the computer.</t4867> <t4868>I had tried to trace her possible journeys, but Margo represented too many things, like the grass.</t4868> <t4869>It seemed impossible to locate her on the maps.</t4869> <t4870>She was too small and the space covered by the maps, too large.</t4870> <t4871>They were more than a waste of time.</t4871> <t4872>They were the physical representation of the inefficacy of it all, my absolute incapacity to develop palms that could encompass continents, to have a mind that could imagine correctly.</t4872>
<t4873>I got up, went to the maps, and pulled them down.</t4873> <t4874>The thumbtacks came off with the paper and fell to the floor.</t4874> <t4875>I crumpled the maps and threw them in the trash can.</t4875> <t4876>On my way back to bed, I stepped on a thumbtack, like an idiot, and although I was angry, exhausted, and had run out of pseudo-visions and ideas, I had to pick up all the thumbtacks scattered on the carpet so I wouldn't step on them later.</t4876> <t4877>What my body wanted was to punch the wall, but I had to pick up the damn thumbtacks.</t4877> <t4878>When I was done, I got back into bed and punched the pillow with clenched teeth.</t4878>
<t4879>I tried to keep reading Whitman's book, but between reading and not stopping thinking about Margo, I felt suffocated enough for that night, so in the end, I put the book down.</t4879> <t4880>I didn't even bother to get up to turn off the light.</t4880> <t4881>I stayed staring at the wall, blinking more and more.</t4881> <t4882>And every time I opened my eyes, I saw the piece of wall where the maps had been, the four holes forming a rectangle, and the holes inside the rectangle, scattered randomly.</t4882> <t4883>I had seen a similar drawing before.</t4883> <t4884>In the empty room, above the carpet.</t4884>
<t4885>A map.</t4885> <t4886>With marked points.</t4886>
<t4887>18</t4887>
<t4888>On Saturday, the light woke me up a little before seven in the morning.</t4888> <t4889>Incredibly, Radar was already logged in on the computer.</t4889>
<t4890>QTHERESURRECTION: I thought you would be sleeping.</t4890>
<t4891>OMNICTIONARIAN96: No, dude.</t4891> <t4892>I've been up since six, expanding the article on a Malaysian pop singer.</t4892> <t4893>But Angela is still in bed.</t4893>
<t4894>QTHERESURRECTION: Ooh, has he/she stayed at your house?</t4894>
<t4895>OMNICTIONARIAN96: Yes, but my purity remains intact.</t4895> <t4896>Although on graduation night...</t4896> <t4897>Maybe.</t4897>
<t4898>QTHERESURRECTION: Hey, yesterday I thought of something.</t4898> <t4899>The holes in the wall of the shopping center...</t4899> <t4900>Could they be pinholes stuck in a map?</t4900>
<t4901>OMNICTIONARIAN96: Like a route.</t4901>
<t4902>QTHERESURRECTION: Exactly.</t4902>
<t4903>OMNICTIONARIAN96: Do you want us to go?</t4903> <t4904>Although I have to wait for Angela to get up.</t4904>
<t4905>QTHERESURRECTION: Very well.</t4905>
<t4906>He called me at ten.</t4906> <t4907>I picked him up by car and then we went to Ben's house, because we figured the only way to wake him up was with a surprise attack.</t4907> <t4908>But even though we sang "You Are My Sunshine" in front of his window, all we managed to do was get him to open it and yell at us.</t4908>
<t4909>—I don't plan to do anything until twelve —he said authoritatively.</t4909>
<t4910>So Radar and I went alone.</t4910> <t4911>He talked to me for a while about Angela, told me that he liked her a lot and that it was weird to fall in love a few months before each of them went to a different university, but I found it hard to pay attention.</t4911> <t4912>I wanted that map.</t4912> <t4913>I wanted to see the places she had marked.</t4913> <t4914>I wanted to pin the tacks back on the wall.</t4914>
<t4915>We entered the office, rushed to the library, stopped for a moment to check the holes in the wall, and entered the souvenir shop.</t4915> <t4916>The building no longer scared me in the slightest.</t4916> <t4917>As soon as we had gone through all the rooms and confirmed that we were alone, I felt as safe as I did at home.</t4917> <t4918>Under a display case, I found the box of maps and brochures that I had rummaged through on the night of the dance.</t4918> <t4919>I lifted it and leaned it against the corner of a display case with broken glass.</t4919> <t4920>Radar was looking for anything that had a map, and I unfolded it and checked if it had holes.</t4920>
<t4921>We were reaching the bottom of the box when Radar pulled out a black and white pamphlet titled FIVE THOUSAND AMERICAN CITIES.</t4921> <t4922>The copyright was from 1972, by the Esso company.</t4922> <t4923>As he carefully unfolded the map and tried to smooth out the creases, I saw a hole in the corner.</t4923>
<t4924>"It's this one," I said, raising my voice.</t4924>
<t4925>Next to the hole there was a torn piece, as if they had ripped the map off the wall.</t4925> <t4926>It was a yellowed and brittle map of the United States, the kind you find in classrooms, marked with possible destinations.</t4926> <t4927>From the creases in the map, I understood that Margo hadn't intended it to be a clue.</t4927> <t4928>She was too precise and sure with her clues to muddy the waters.</t4928> <t4929>In any case, we had found something she hadn't anticipated, and seeing what she hadn't anticipated, I thought again that she had anticipated many things.</t4929> <t4930>And I thought that maybe that was what she had done in that dark and silent room.</t4930> <t4931>Traveling while lying down, like Whitman, as she prepared for what she was really going to do.</t4931>
<t4932>I returned to the office and found a handful of thumbtacks on a table next to Margo's.</t4932> <t4933>Then Radar and I carefully carried the unfolded map to Margo's room.</t4933> <t4934>I held it against the wall while Radar tried to insert the thumbtacks into the holes, but three of the four corners had broken, as well as three of the five locations, probably from removing the map from the wall.</t4934>
<t4935>—Higher up and to the left —Radar told me—.</t4935> <t4936>No, lower.</t4936> <t4937>Yes.</t4937> <t4938>Don't move.</t4938>
<t4939>We finally pinned the map and started aligning the holes in the map with those on the wall.</t4939> <t4940>It didn't take us too long to assemble the five points.</t4940> <t4941>But, since some holes were torn, it was impossible to determine the EXACT location.</t4941> <t4942>And the exact location was important on a map that showed the names of five thousand towns.</t4942> <t4943>The lettering was so small that I had to get on the carpet and bring my eyes a few centimeters from the map to try to identify each town.</t4943> <t4944>I started saying names, and Radar took out his pocket computer and looked them up on the Omnictionary.</t4944>
<t4945>There were two holes without tears.</t4945> <t4946>One seemed to be Los Angeles, although in Southern California there were so many cities together that the names overlapped.</t4946> <t4947>The other intact hole was in Chicago.</t4947> <t4948>There was a torn one in New York, which, judging by its position on the wall, corresponded to one of the city's five boroughs.</t4948>
<t4949>—It fits with what we know.</t4949>
<t4950>—Yes —I told him—.</t4950> <t4951>But, damn, which part of New York?</t4951> <t4952>That's the question.</t4952>
<t4953>—We missed something —he replied—.</t4953> <t4954>Some clue.</t4954> <t4955>Where are the other points?</t4955>
<t4956>—There is another one in the state of New York, but it is not near the city.</t4956> <t4957>Well, look, all the cities are tiny.</t4957> <t4958>It could be Poughkeepsie, Woodstock, or the Catskill park.</t4958>
<t4959>—Woodstock —said Radar—.</t4959> <t4960>It would be interesting.</t4960> <t4961>Margo isn't very hippy, but she has that free spirit vibe.</t4961>
<t4962>—I don't know —I replied—.</t4962> <t4963>The last one is in the city of Washington or maybe in Annapolis or the Chesapeake Bay.</t4963> <t4964>Actually, it could be in a bunch of places.</t4964>
<t4965>—It would help a bit if there was only one point on the map —said Radar in a somber tone.</t4965>
<t4966>—But surely he goes from one place to another —I told him.</t4966>
<t4967>Embarking on his eternal journey.</t4967>
<t4968>I sat for a while on the carpet while Radar read me information about New York, about the Catskill Mountains, about the capital of the country, and about the 1969 concert in Woodstock.</t4968> <t4969>Nothing seemed to help.</t4969> <t4970>I felt as if we had pulled the thread and found nothing.</t4970>
<t4971>That afternoon, after dropping Radar off at his house, I sat down to read "Song of Myself" and study without much enthusiasm for the final exams.</t4971> <t4972>On Monday, I had calculus and Latin, probably the two toughest subjects, so I couldn't afford to completely overlook them.</t4972> <t4973>I studied almost all Saturday night and Sunday, but right after dinner, an idea occurred to me.</t4973> <t4974>I set aside Ovid's translations for a moment and turned on the computer.</t4974> <t4975>I saw Lacey was online.</t4975> <t4976>I had just found out her nickname from Ben, but I figured I knew her well enough to write her a message.</t4976>
<t4977>QTHERESURRECTION: Hello, I am Q.</t4977>
<t4978>PENITENCEHABIT: Hello!</t4978>
<t4979>QTHERESURRECTION: Have you ever thought about how much time Margo had to spend planning everything?</t4979>
<t4980>HABIT OF PENANCE:</t4980> <t4981>Yes, are you referring to leaving letters in the soup bowl before going to Mississippi and orienting yourself towards the shopping center?</t4981>
<t4982>THERESURRECTION:</t4982> <t4983>Yes, these are not things that come to mind in ten minutes.</t4983>
<t4984>PENITENCEHABIT:</t4984> <t4985>Perhaps the notebook...</t4985>
<t4986>QTHERESURRECTION: Exactly.</t4986>
<t4987>HABITODEPENITENCIA: Yes.</t4987> <t4988>I thought about it today because I remembered that once, while shopping, she made sure to place the notebook next to the bags she liked to ensure it would fit.</t4988>
<t4989>QTHERESURRECTION: I wish I had that notebook.</t4989>
<t4990>HABITOFREPENTANCE:</t4990> <t4991>Surely he carries it with him.</t4991>
<t4992>QTHERESURRECTION: Yes.</t4992> <t4993>Wasn't it in your locker?</t4993>
<t4994>HABITODEPENITENCIA: No, just perfectly stacked textbooks, as always.</t4994>
<t4995>I continued studying at my desk and waited for someone else to log in.</t4995> <t4996>After a while, Ben joined, and I invited him to a chat room with me and Lacey.</t4996> <t4997>The two of them talked almost the entire time —I kept translating— until Radar logged in and I invited him to the room.</t4997> <t4998>Then I stopped studying for the night.</t4998>
<t4999>OMNICTIONARIAN96: Someone from New York searched for Margo Roth Spiegelman on the Omnictionary today.</t4999>
<t5000>ITWASAKIDNEYINFECTION: Do you know exactly where from?</t5000>
<t5001>OMNICTIONARIAN96: Unfortunately, no.</t5001>
<t5002>HABITODEPENITENCIA: There are still posters in various record stores.</t5002> <t5003>Surely it was someone who wanted to know who it was.</t5003>
<t5004>OMNICTIONARIAN96: Oh, right.</t5004> <t5005>I had forgotten.</t5005> <t5006>Shit.</t5006>
<t5007>QTHERESURRECTION: Eh, I come and go because I'm working with the page that Radar showed me to plot routes between the places he marked with a pushpin.</t5007>
<t5008>ITWASAKIDNEYINFECTION: Link?</t5008>
<t5009>QTHERESURRECTION: the long way round.</t5009> <t5010>com</t5010>
<t5011>OMNICTIONARIAN96: I have a new theory.</t5011> <t5012>She is going to appear at the graduation, sitting among the audience.</t5012>
<t5013>ITWASAKIDNEYINFECTION:</t5013> <t5014>I have an old theory: it is somewhere in Orlando, manipulating us and making sure it is the center of our universe.</t5014>
<t5015>HABITODEPENITENCIA: Ben!</t5015>
<t5016>ITWASAKIDNEYINFECTION: I'm sorry, but I am completely right.</t5016>
<t5017>They continued like this, chatting about their Margos, while I tried to trace their route.</t5017> <t5018>If he didn't intend for the map to be a clue —and the torn holes seemed to indicate he didn't—, I supposed we had all the clues he had anticipated and much more.</t5018> <t5019>Without a doubt, I had what I needed.</t5019> <t5020>But I still felt very far from her.</t5020>
<t5021>19</t5021>
<t5022>On Monday morning, after three long hours alone with eight hundred words of Ovid, I crossed the hallways with the feeling that my brain was going to spill out of my ears.</t5022> <t5023>But I had done well.</t5023> <t5024>We had an hour and a half to eat and clear our heads before the second round of exams.</t5024> <t5025>Radar was waiting for me at my locker.</t5025>
<t5026>—I just failed Spanish —he told me.</t5026>
<t5027>—I'm sure it went well for you.</t5027>
<t5028>Radar had a good scholarship for Dartmouth.</t5028> <t5029>He was very intelligent.</t5029>
<t5030>—Uncle, I don't know.</t5030> <t5031>I almost fell asleep during the oral exam.</t5031> <t5032>But it's because I spent half the night awake working on a program.</t5032> <t5033>It's incredible.</t5033> <t5034>You type in a category (it can be either a geographical area or an animal species) and then you can read on a single page the first lines of about a hundred Omnictionary articles related to that topic.</t5034> <t5035>Let's say you're looking for a specific species of rabbit, but you can't remember the name.</t5035> <t5036>You can read the introduction of the twenty-one species of rabbit on the same page in three minutes.</t5036>
<t5037>—Did you make that program the night before the final exams? —I asked him.</t5037>
<t5038>—Yes, I already know, okay?</t5038> <t5039>Alright, I'll send it to you by mail.</t5039> <t5040>It's a geeky thing.</t5040>
<t5041>Then Ben appeared.</t5041>
<t5042>—Q, I swear to God that Lacey and I were on the chat until two in the morning tangled up with the page you gave us.</t5042> <t5043>And now that we have mapped out all the routes Margo could have taken between Orlando and those five points, I realize that I have been wrong all along.</t5043> <t5044>She is not in Orlando.</t5044> <t5045>Radar is right.</t5045> <t5046>She will come back for graduation.</t5046>
<t5047>—Why?</t5047>
<t5048>—It is perfectly timed.</t5048> <t5049>Driving from Orlando to New York, to the mountains of Chicago, to Los Angeles and back to Orlando takes exactly twenty-three days.</t5049> <t5050>Besides, it’s a crazy joke, but it’s Margo’s thing.</t5050> <t5051>You make everyone think you’ve disappeared.</t5051> <t5052>You surround yourself with an aura of mystery so that everyone pays attention to you.</t5052> <t5053>And just when the interest starts to fade, you show up at graduation.</t5053>
<t5054>—No —I said—.</t5054> <t5055>Impossible.</t5055>
<t5056>I already knew Margo better.</t5056> <t5057>I did believe that she liked to attract attention, but Margo did not take life lightly.</t5057> <t5058>She hadn't disappeared to deceive us.</t5058>
<t5059>—I'm telling you, buddy.</t5059> <t5060>Look for her at the graduation.</t5060> <t5061>She'll be there.</t5061>
<t5062>I shook my head.</t5062> <t5063>Since everyone had the same lunch hour, the cafeteria was packed, so we exercised our right as seniors and drove to Wendy’s.</t5063> <t5064>I tried to focus on the calculus exam, but I started to feel that the story had more threads.</t5064> <t5065>If Ben was right about the twenty-three days of travel, the fact was certainly interesting.</t5065> <t5066>Maybe it was what he had planned in his black notebook, a long and lonely road trip.</t5066> <t5067>It didn’t explain everything, but it fit with Margo’s planning nature.</t5067> <t5068>And it didn’t bring me any closer to her.</t5068> <t5069>It was already hard enough to locate a point on a crumpled piece of map without the point moving.</t5069>
<t5070>After a long day of final exams, returning to the comfortable seclusion of "Song of Myself" was almost a relief.</t5070> <t5071>I had reached a strange part of the poem.</t5071> <t5072>After having been listening to and hearing people, and traveling with them, Whitman stops listening and traveling and starts becoming other people.</t5072> <t5073>As if he inhabited them.</t5073> <t5074>He tells the story of a ship captain who saved everyone except himself.</t5074> <t5075>The poet says he can tell that story because he has become the captain.</t5075> <t5076>And he writes: "I am the man, I suffered, I was there."</t5076> <t5077>A few verses later it becomes even clearer that Whitman no longer needs to listen to become another person: "I do not ask the wounded how he feels, I am the wounded."</t5077>
<t5078>I put down the book and lay on my side, looking through the window that had always been between us.</t5078> <t5079>It's not enough to see her or hear her.</t5079> <t5080>To find Margo Roth Spiegelman, you have to become Margo Roth Spiegelman.</t5080>
<t5081>And I had done many of the things that perhaps she had done.</t5081> <t5082>I had managed to unite the most unlikely couple at the dance.</t5082> <t5083>I had silenced the dogs of the caste war.</t5083> <t5084>I had managed to feel comfortable in the haunted, rat-filled house where Margo had planned everything.</t5084> <t5085>I had seen.</t5085> <t5086>I had listened.</t5086> <t5087>But I still couldn't become the wounded person.</t5087>
<t5088>The next day I did the physics and politics exams as best as I could, and on Tuesday I stayed up until two in the morning finishing the end-of-course literature paper on Moby Dick.</t5088> <t5089>I decided that Ahab was a hero.</t5089> <t5090>I had no particular reason for making that decision—especially considering that I hadn't read the book—but I decided it and acted accordingly.</t5090>
<t5091>The shortened exam week meant that Wednesday was our last day of class.</t5091> <t5092>And throughout the day, I found it difficult not to wander around thinking about everything I was doing for the last time.</t5092> <t5093>The last time forming a circle by the rehearsal room door, in the shade of the oak tree that has sheltered generations of band geeks.</t5093> <t5094>The last time eating pizza in the cafeteria with Ben.</t5094> <t5095>The last time sitting in that high school writing a paper with one hand tucked into a blue book.</t5095> <t5096>The last time looking at the clock.</t5096> <t5097>The last time seeing Chuck Parson lurking in the hallways with a half-contemptuous smile.</t5097> <t5098>Damn.</t5098> <t5099>I was starting to feel nostalgic for Chuck Parson.</t5099> <t5100>I must have been sick.</t5100>
<t5101>Something like that Margo must have felt too.</t5101> <t5102>While she was making her plans, she undoubtedly knew she would leave, and surely even she couldn't be completely immune to that feeling.</t5102> <t5103>She had had good times at that school.</t5103> <t5104>And on the last day, it's very hard to remember the bad times, because in any case, she had made her life there, just like I did.</t5104> <t5105>The city was paper, but the memories were not.</t5105> <t5106>Everything she had done there, all the love, the sorrow, the compassion, the violence, and the resentment kept flowing from within me.</t5106> <t5107>Those whitewashed concrete walls.</t5107> <t5108>My white walls.</t5108> <t5109>Margo's white walls.</t5109> <t5110>For a long time, we had been captives within them, trapped in their stomach, like Jonah.</t5110>
<t5111>Throughout the day, I found myself thinking that perhaps that feeling was the reason why Margo had planned everything so complexly and precisely.</t5111> <t5112>Even if you want to leave, it is very difficult.</t5112> <t5113>It required preparation, and perhaps sitting in that shopping mall to write her plans was both an intellectual and emotional task, her way of imagining herself at her destination.</t5113>
<t5114>Ben and Radar had a marathon rehearsal with the band to make sure they would play "Pomp and Circumstance" at graduation.</t5114> <t5115>Lacey offered to take me home, but I decided to empty my locker, because the truth was that I didn't feel like going back to the school and having to feel my lungs drowning in that stubborn nostalgia again.</t5115>
<t5116>My locker was a real shithole, half trash can and half book storage.</t5116> <t5117>I remembered that when Lacey opened Margo's locker, the books were perfectly stacked, as if she intended to go to class the next day.</t5117> <t5118>I placed a trash can on the bench and opened my locker.</t5118> <t5119>The first thing I did was peel off a photo of Radar, Ben, and me grinning from ear to ear.</t5119> <t5120>I put it in my backpack and started the disgusting process of rummaging through the junk accumulated over the whole year—gum wrapped in pieces of notebook paper, pens without ink, greasy napkins—and throwing it into the trash can.</t5120> <t5121>As I did so, I thought: "I will never do this again, I will never be here again, this locker will never be mine again, Radar and I will never write notes to each other in calculus class again, I will never see Margo in the hallway again."</t5121> <t5122>It was the first time in my life that so many things would never happen again.</t5122>
<t5123>And in the end, it was too much.</t5123> <t5124>I couldn't shake off that feeling and it became unbearable.</t5124> <t5125>I extended my arms, reached deep into the locker, and pushed everything —photos, notes, and books— into the trash bin.</t5125> <t5126>I left the locker open and walked away.</t5126> <t5127>As I passed by the rehearsal room, I heard the muffled sound of "Pomp and Circumstance" on the other side of the wall.</t5127> <t5128>I kept walking.</t5128> <t5129>Outside, it was hot, though not as much as usual.</t5129> <t5130>It was bearable.</t5130> <t5131>"There are sidewalks for almost the entire way home," I thought.</t5131> <t5132>And I kept walking.</t5132>
<t5133>And as paralyzing and sad as all those "never agains" were, it seemed perfect to leave like this for the last time.</t5133> <t5134>A pure departure.</t5134> <t5135>The most refined form of liberation possible.</t5135> <t5136>Everything important, except for one terrible photo, was in the trash, but I felt great.</t5136> <t5137>I started to run, because I wanted to put even more distance between the school and me.</t5137>
<t5138>Leaving is very hard... until you leave.</t5138> <t5139>Then it is the easiest thing in the world.</t5139>
<t5140>While I was running, I felt that for the first time I was becoming Margo.</t5140> <t5141>I knew it: "She is not in Orlando. She is not in Florida."</t5141> <t5142>Leaving is fantastic once you have left.</t5142> <t5143>If I had gone by car, not on foot, I probably would have kept going as well.</t5143> <t5144>Margo had left and was not going to return, neither for graduation nor for anything else.</t5144> <t5145>I was sure of it.</t5145>
<t5146>I'm leaving, and leaving is so stimulating that I know I can't go back.</t5146> <t5147>And then?</t5147> <t5148>Do I devote myself to leaving places over and over again?</t5148> <t5149>Do I embark on an eternal journey?</t5149>
<t5150>Ben and Radar passed by me half a kilometer from Jefferson Park.</t5150> <t5151>Ben slammed on the brakes right in front of Lakemont, even though the road was full of cars.</t5151> <t5152>I ran to the car and got in.</t5152> <t5153>They wanted to play Resurrection at my house, but I had to tell them no, because I was closer to Margo than ever.</t5153>
<t5154>20</t5154>
<t5155>On Wednesday night and all of Thursday, I tried to use everything I already knew about Margo to find some meaning in the clues I had, some connection between the map and the travel books, or perhaps some link between Whitman and the map that would help me understand her travel diary.</t5155> <t5156>But I increasingly got the impression that maybe she was too fascinated by the pleasure of leaving to leave a breadcrumb trail.</t5156> <t5157>And if that was the case, the map she hadn't intended for us to see could be our best bet to find her.</t5157> <t5158>But the markings on the map weren't concrete enough.</t5158> <t5159>Even the Catskill Park, which interested me because it was the only spot not in a big city, not even close, was too large and had too many inhabitants to find one person.</t5159> <t5160>"Song of Myself" mentioned places in New York City, but there were too many locations to track them all.</t5160> <t5161>How do you locate a point on a map when it seems the point moves from one city to another?</t5161>
<t5162>On Friday morning, I was already up, leafing through travel guides, when my parents entered my room.</t5162> <t5163>Since they rarely came in together, my stomach turned —maybe they had bad news about Margo—, but then I suddenly remembered it was my graduation day.</t5163>
<t5164>—Are you ready?</t5164>
<t5165>—Yes.</t5165> <t5166>Well, it's not that important, but it will be fun.</t5166>
<t5167>"You only graduate once," my mother told me.</t5167>
<t5168>—Yes —I answered him.</t5168>
<t5169>They sat on the bed.</t5169> <t5170>I noticed that they looked at each other and smiled.</t5170>
<t5171>—What's happening? —I asked them.</t5171>
<t5172>—Well, we want to give you your graduation gift —said my mother—.</t5172> <t5173>We are very proud of you, Quentin.</t5173> <t5174>You are the greatest achievement of our life, today is a great day for you and we are…</t5174> <t5175>You are a great kid.</t5175>
<t5176>I smiled and lowered my gaze.</t5176> <t5177>Then my father took out a very small gift wrapped in blue paper.</t5177>
<t5178>—No —I said, taking it out of his hands.</t5178>
<t5179>—Come on, open it.</t5179>
<t5180>—It can't be —I said, looking at the little package.</t5180>
<t5181>It was the size of a key.</t5181> <t5182>It weighed like a key.</t5182> <t5183>When shaking the box, it sounded like a key.</t5183>
<t5184>—Open it now, honey —my mother urged me.</t5184>
<t5185>I tore off the paper.</t5185> <t5186>A KEY!</t5186> <t5187>I examined it closely.</t5187> <t5188>The key to a Ford! None of our cars was a Ford.</t5188>
<t5189>—Have you bought me a car?</t5189>
<t5190>—Exactly —my father replied to me—.</t5190> <t5191>It's not new, but it has only two years and thirty thousand kilometers.</t5191>
<t5192>I jumped out of bed and hugged them both.</t5192>
<t5193>—Is it mine?</t5193>
<t5194>—Yes! —my mother almost shouted.</t5194>
<t5195>I already had a car! A car! Mine!</t5195>
<t5196>I let go of my parents, shouted "thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you" while running through the dining room, and opened the front door dressed only in an old t-shirt and underwear.</t5196> <t5197>Parked in the driveway, with a huge blue bow, was a Ford minivan.</t5197>
<t5198>They had given me a minivan.</t5198> <t5199>They could have chosen any car, but they chose a minivan.</t5199> <t5200>A minivan.</t5200> <t5201>Oh, God of Vehicular Justice, why do you mock me? Minivan, you are my cross! You, mark of Cain! You, miserable beast with a high roof and few horsepower!</t5201>
<t5202>I put on a good face when I turned around.</t5202>
<t5203>—Thank you, thank you, thank you! —I told them, although I was sure I didn't seem as effusive now that I was pretending.</t5203>
<t5204>—Well, we knew you loved mine —my mother told me.</t5204>
<t5205>They were both radiant, undoubtedly convinced that they had given me the vehicle of my dreams.</t5205>
<t5206>—It's fantastic for you to go out there with your friends —added my father.</t5206>
<t5207>And to think that they were specialists in analyzing and understanding human psychology...</t5207>
<t5208>—Hey —said my father—, we should start thinking about leaving if we want to get good seats.</t5208>
<t5209>I hadn't showered, nor dressed, nor anything.</t5209> <t5210>Well, to be exact, I didn't have to dress either, but anyway.</t5210>
<t5211>—I don't have to be there until twelve-thirty —I told them—.</t5211> <t5212>I have to get ready.</t5212>
<t5213>My father furrowed his brow.</t5213>
<t5214>—Well, the truth is that I want to sit in a good row so I can take pho…</t5214>
<t5215>—I can take MY CAR —I interrupted him—.</t5215> <t5216>I can go ALONE in MY CAR.</t5216>
<t5217>I smiled from ear to ear.</t5217>
<t5218>—I already know! —my mother replied enthusiastically.</t5218>
<t5219>And what the hell, after all, a car is a car.</t5219> <t5220>I'm sure driving my minivan was a step above driving someone else's minivan.</t5220>
<t5221>I went back to the computer and informed Radar and Lacey (Ben wasn't online) about the car.</t5221>
<t5222>OMNICTIONARIAN96:</t5222> <t5223>It's really great news, truly.</t5223> <t5224>Can I stop by your house to leave a fridge in the trunk?</t5224> <t5225>I have to take my parents to the graduation and I don't want them to see it.</t5225>
<t5226>QTHERESURRECTION: Of course, it's open.</t5226> <t5227>What is the fridge for?</t5227>
<t5228>OMNICTIONARIAN96: Well, since nobody drank at my party, there are 212 beers left, so we will take them to Lacey's house for her party tonight.</t5228>
<t5229>QTHERESURRECTION: 212 beers?</t5229>
<t5230>OMNICTIONARIAN96: It is a big refrigerator.</t5230>
<t5231>Then Ben entered the chat SHOUTING that he had already showered, that he was naked, and that he only needed to put on the gown and cap.</t5231> <t5232>We all talked for a good while about our graduation while naked.</t5232> <t5233>When everyone had disconnected to get ready, I got into the shower, lifted my head so the water would fall directly on my face, and as the water pounded me, I started to think.</t5233> <t5234>New York or California? Chicago or Washington?</t5234> <t5235>I could also go, I thought.</t5235> <t5236>I had a car, like her.</t5236> <t5237>I could go to the five points on the map and, even if I didn't find her, it would be more fun than spending another scorching summer in Orlando.</t5237> <t5238>But no.</t5238> <t5239>It was like sneaking into SeaWorld.</t5239> <t5240>It requires an impeccable plan, then you execute it brilliantly, and then… nothing.</t5240> <t5241>Then it's SeaWorld, only darker.</t5241> <t5242>Margo told me that the pleasure isn't in doing something.</t5242> <t5243>The pleasure is in planning it.</t5243>
<t5244>And that's what she was thinking about under the shower stream: the plan.</t5244> <t5245>She is sitting in the abandoned shopping mall with her notebook, making plans.</t5245> <t5246>Maybe she is planning a road trip and using the map to see the routes.</t5246> <t5247>She reads Whitman and marks "The journey I have undertaken is eternal," because that's what she likes to imagine, the kind of things she likes to plan.</t5247>
<t5248>But is it the kind of thing that he really likes to do?</t5248> <t5249>No.</t5249> <t5250>Because Margo knows the secret of leaving, the secret that I have just learned: leaving makes you feel good and is only authentic when you leave behind something important, something that mattered to you.</t5250> <t5251>Uprooting life from its roots.</t5251> <t5252>But you can't do it while your life hasn't taken root.</t5252>
<t5253>That's why when she left, she left for good.</t5253> <t5254>But I couldn't believe that she had embarked on an eternal journey.</t5254> <t5255>I was sure she had gone somewhere, to a place where she could stay long enough for it to matter to her, long enough so that the next departure would make her feel as good as the previous one.</t5255> <t5256>“There is a corner in the world, somewhere far away, where no one knows what 'Margo Roth Spiegelman' means.</t5256> <t5257>And Margo is sitting there, writing in her black notebook.”</t5257>
<t5258>The water started to cool down.</t5258> <t5259>I hadn't even touched the bar of soap, but I got out, wrapped a towel around my waist, and sat in front of the computer.</t5259>
<t5260>I opened Radar's email with the Omnictionary program and downloaded it.</t5260> <t5261>The truth is that it was great.</t5261> <t5262>First, I entered the postal code for downtown Chicago, clicked "location," and requested a radius of thirty kilometers.</t5262> <t5263>I got a hundred responses, from Navy Pier to Deerfield.</t5263> <t5264>The first line of each entry appeared on the screen, so I read them in about five minutes.</t5264> <t5265>I didn't see anything noteworthy.</t5265> <t5266>Then I tried with the postal code for Catskill Park in New York.</t5266> <t5267>This time there were fewer results, eighty-two, organized by the date the page was created on Omnictionary.</t5267> <t5268>I started reading.</t5268>
<t5269>Woodstock, New York, is a city in Ulster County, New York, well known for the 1969 concert that bore its name (see Woodstock Concert), a three-day event where artists like Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin performed, although the concert was actually held in a nearby town.</t5269>
<t5270>Lake Katrine is a small lake in Ulster County, New York, which Henry David Thoreau often visited.</t5270>
<t5271>The Catskill Park covers almost three thousand square kilometers of the Catskill Mountains and is jointly owned by the State and local government, with a 5 percent stake held by New York City, which receives a good portion of its water from reservoirs located partially within the park.</t5271>
<t5272>Roscoe, New York, is a village in the state of New York that, according to a recent census, has 261 families.</t5272>
<t5273>Agloe, New York, is a fictional town created by the Esso company in the early 1930s and included in tourist maps as a trap to control copyright.</t5273> <t5274>These fictional towns are also called paper towns.</t5274>
<t5275>I clicked on the link and it took me to the full article, which continued saying:</t5275>
<t5276>Agloe, situated at the intersection of two unpaved roads north of Roscoe, New York, was created by cartographers Otto G. Lindberg and Ernest Alpers, who invented the name of the town by forming an anagram with their initials.</t5276> <t5277>For centuries, traps have been introduced into maps to control copyright.</t5277> <t5278>Cartographers create fictitious places, streets, and towns and place them in an inconspicuous spot on their map.</t5278> <t5279>If the fictitious entry appears on another cartographer's map, it is evident that the map has been plagiarized.</t5279> <t5280>These traps are also known as key traps, paper streets, and paper towns (see also fictitious entries).</t5280> <t5281>Although very few cartographic companies admit their existence, the traps remain a frequent feature even in contemporary maps.</t5281>
<t5282>In the 1940s, Agloe, New York, began to appear on maps from other companies.</t5282> <t5283>Esso suspected that they had infringed copyright laws and prepared to sue them, but in reality, an unknown resident had built the Agloe Supermarket at the intersection that appeared on Esso's map.</t5283>
<t5284>The supermarket, which still stands (citation needed), is the only building in Agloe, which continues to appear on many maps and whose population is usually recorded as zero.</t5284>
<t5285>All entries in the Omnictionary contain subpages where all the edits made to the page and any comments from Omnictionary members can be seen.</t5285> <t5286>The Agloe page had not been edited by anyone in almost a year, but there was a recent comment from an anonymous user:</t5286>
<t5287>For the information of whoever edits this: the population of Agloe will be one person until May 29 at noon.</t5287>
<t5288>I recognized the capital letters immediately.</t5288> <t5289>“The rules of capitalization are very unfair to the words that are in the middle.”</t5289> <t5290>I felt a lump in my throat, but I forced myself to calm down.</t5290> <t5291>I had left the comment fifteen days ago.</t5291> <t5292>It had stayed there all that time, waiting for me.</t5292> <t5293>I looked at the computer clock.</t5293> <t5294>I had less than twenty-four hours left.</t5294>
<t5295>For the first time in weeks, I had no doubt that she was alive.</t5295> <t5296>She was alive.</t5296> <t5297>And she would be alive for at least one more day.</t5297> <t5298>I had focused so much time on locating her, mainly to avoid obsessively asking myself if she was alive, that I hadn't realized how terrified I had been until then, but, oh, my God.</t5298> <t5299>She was alive.</t5299>
<t5300>I jumped up, let the towel fall, and called Radar.</t5300> <t5301>I rested the phone on one shoulder and held it with my chin while I put on some underwear and shorts.</t5301>
<t5302>—I know what paper towns means!</t5302> <t5303>Do you have the laptop with you?</t5303>
<t5304>—Yes.</t5304> <t5305>Dude, you should be here already.</t5305> <t5306>We're about to form the line.</t5306>
<t5307>I heard Ben shouting at him:</t5307>
<t5308>—Tell him he better be naked!</t5308>
<t5309>—Radar —I told him, trying to convey that it was important—.</t5309> <t5310>Look up the page for Agloe, New York.</t5310> <t5311>Do you have it?</t5311>
<t5312>—Yes, I am reading.</t5312> <t5313>Wait.</t5313> <t5314>Wow. Wow.</t5314> <t5315>Could it be the Catskills marked on the map?</t5315>
<t5316>—Yes, I think so.</t5316> <t5317>It's very close.</t5317> <t5318>Go to the comments page.</t5318>
<t5319>—...</t5319>
<t5320>—Radar?</t5320>
<t5321>—Damn.</t5321>
<t5322>—I know, I know! —I shouted.</t5322>
<t5323>I didn't hear his response because I was putting on my shirt, but when the phone was back to my ear, I heard him talking to Ben.</t5323> <t5324>I hung up.</t5324>
<t5325>I searched the web for driving routes from Orlando to Agloe, but the map program had never heard of Agloe, so I changed it to Roscoe.</t5325> <t5326>The computer said that, at an average of one hundred kilometers per hour, the trip would take nineteen hours and four minutes.</t5326> <t5327>It was a quarter past two.</t5327> <t5328>I had twenty-one hours and forty-five minutes to get there.</t5328> <t5329>I printed the route, grabbed the car keys, and closed the front door.</t5329>
<t5330>—It is nineteen hours and four minutes away —I said on the phone.</t5330>
<t5331>I had called Radar's cell phone, but Ben had answered.</t5331>
<t5332>—And what are you going to do? —he asked me—.</t5332> <t5333>Are you going to catch a plane?</t5333>
<t5334>—No, I don't have enough money, and besides, it's about eight hours from New York, so I'll go by car.</t5334>
<t5335>Suddenly, Radar retrieved the phone.</t5335>
<t5336>—How long does the trip take?</t5336>
<t5337>—Nineteen hours and four minutes.</t5337>
<t5338>—Where is the information from?</t5338>
<t5339>—Google Maps.</t5339>
<t5340>—Shit —said Radar—.</t5340> <t5341>None of those map programs calculate traffic.</t5341> <t5342>I'll call you now.</t5342> <t5343>And hurry.</t5343> <t5344>We have to get in line right now!</t5344>
<t5345>—I'm not going to go.</t5345> <t5346>I can't risk wasting time —I told him.</t5346>
<t5347>But I was talking to the air.</t5347> <t5348>Radar called me a minute later.</t5348>
<t5349>—At an average speed of one hundred kilometers per hour, without stopping and taking into account the average traffic density, it will take you twenty-three hours and nine minutes.</t5349> <t5350>That means you would arrive after one o'clock, so you're going to have to make up time whenever you can.</t5350>
<t5351>—What?</t5351> <t5352>But the...</t5352>
<t5353>—It's not to criticize, but maybe in this specific matter, the person with chronic lateness should listen to the person who is always punctual.</t5353> <t5354>But you have to come at least for a second, because your parents are going to get hysterical if they call you and you don't show up, and, besides, it's not the most important thing, but... all our beer is in your car.</t5354>
<t5355>—It's clear that I don't have time —I replied to him.</t5355>
<t5356>Ben approached the phone.</t5356>
<t5357>—Don't be an idiot.</t5357> <t5358>It will be five minutes.</t5358>
<t5359>—Okay, agreed.</t5359>
<t5360>I turned right on red and stepped on the accelerator —my car was better than my mother's, but not by much— towards the high school.</t5360> <t5361>I arrived at the gym parking lot in three minutes.</t5361> <t5362>I didn't park.</t5362> <t5363>I stopped the car in the middle of the parking lot and jumped out.</t5363> <t5364>As I ran towards the gym, I saw three guys in robes running towards me.</t5364> <t5365>Radar's robe was flying to the sides, so I saw his long dark legs, and next to him was Ben, who was wearing sneakers without socks.</t5365> <t5366>Lacey was behind them.</t5366>
<t5367>—Grab the beer —I told them without stopping running—.</t5367> <t5368>I have to talk to my parents.</t5368>
<t5369>The families of the graduates were spread out across the stands.</t5369> <t5370>I walked across the basketball court a couple of times until I spotted my parents, roughly in the center.</t5370> <t5371>They were making hand gestures at me.</t5371> <t5372>Since I climbed the steps two at a time, I was almost out of breath when I knelt beside them.</t5372>
<t5373>—Well —I told them—, I'm not going to [breath] stay because [breath] I think I have found Margo and [breath] I have to leave right now, I have my phone with me [breath], please, don't be mad at me and thank you very much again for the car.</t5373>
<t5374>—What? —said my mother, putting her arm around my waist—.</t5374> <t5375>Quentin, what are you saying? Calm down.</t5375>
<t5376>—I'm going to Agloe, New York, and I have to leave right now —I replied—.</t5376> <t5377>Nothing else.</t5377> <t5378>Okay, I have to go.</t5378> <t5379>I can't waste any more time.</t5379> <t5380>I'm taking my phone.</t5380> <t5381>Okay.</t5381> <t5382>I love you all.</t5382>
<t5383>He held me without excessive force, but I freed myself from his hand.</t5383> <t5384>Before they could say anything, I went down the stairs and ran towards the car.</t5384> <t5385>I was inside, had started the engine, and was beginning to move when I saw Ben sitting in the passenger seat.</t5385>
<t5386>—Grab the beers and get out of the car! —I shouted at him.</t5386>
<t5387>—We will go with you —he answered me—.</t5387> <t5388>You would fall asleep if you drove for so many hours.</t5388>
<t5389>I turned around and saw Lacey and Radar with their phones glued to their ears.</t5389>
<t5390>—I have to tell my parents —Lacey explained to me, covering the phone—.</t5390> <t5391>Come on, Q. Let's go let's go let's go let's go let's go let's go.</t5391>
<t5392>THIRD PART</t5392>
<t5393>The container</t5393>
<t5394>HOUR ONE</t5394>
<t5395>It takes a while for each of us to explain to our parents that 1) none of us are going to the graduation, that 2) we are driving to New York, to 3) a city that technically may or may not exist, with the hope of 4) locating the person who posted a comment on the Omnictionary, who, judging by the Random use of capital letters, is 5) Margo Roth Spiegelman.</t5395>
<t5396>Radar is the last one to hang up the phone, and when he finally does, he says:</t5396>
<t5397>—I would like to tell you something: my parents are very angry because I am not at the graduation.</t5397> <t5398>My girlfriend is also very angry, because we had organized something very special in eight hours.</t5398> <t5399>I don't want to go into details, but the trip better be fun.</t5399>
<t5400>—Your ability to not lose your virginity is an inspiration to all of us —says Ben, who is sitting next to me.</t5400>
<t5401>I look at Radar through the rearview mirror.</t5401>
<t5402>—A CAR TRIP, YAY! —I say to him.</t5402>
<t5403>Despite himself, a smile appears on his face.</t5403> <t5404>The pleasure of leaving.</t5404>
<t5405>We are on the I-4, and the traffic is smooth, which in itself borders on the miraculous.</t5405> <t5406>We are in the left lane going ten kilometers per hour above the speed limit, which is ninety, because once I was told that they only catch you if you exceed by more than fifteen kilometers.</t5406>
<t5407>We didn't take long to distribute the papers.</t5407>
<t5408>Lacey, in the very back, is in charge of the supplies.</t5408> <t5409>She lists out loud the provisions we have for the trip: half of a Snickers bar that Ben was eating when I called to tell them about Margo; the two hundred and twelve beers in the trunk; the routes I printed out and the following items from her purse: eight mint gums, a pencil, tissues, three tampons, a pair of sunglasses, a lip balm stick, her house keys, a Young Christians Association card, a library card, several purchase receipts, thirty-five dollars, and a BP gas station card.</t5409>
<t5410>—How exciting! —says Lacey from the back of the minivan—.</t5410> <t5411>We are like pioneers without supplies!</t5411> <t5412>Although I wish we had more money.</t5412>
<t5413>—At least we have the BP card —I tell him—.</t5413> <t5414>We can buy gas and food.</t5414>
<t5415>I look in the rearview mirror and see Radar, wearing his graduation gown, looking into Lacey's bag.</t5415> <t5416>Since the gown has a rather low neckline, I can see several curly hairs on his chest.</t5416>
<t5417>—You wouldn't happen to have any underwear in here, would you? —he asks her.</t5417>
<t5418>—Seriously, we better make a stop at a clothing store —adds Ben.</t5418>
<t5419>Radar takes out his pocket computer and begins his work: documentation and calculations.</t5419> <t5420>He is sitting alone behind me, with the routes and the minivan manual spread out beside him.</t5420> <t5421>He is calculating the speed we need to travel to arrive before noon tomorrow, how many times we will need to stop so the car doesn't run out of gas, the BP gas stations along our route, how long each stop will take, and how much time we will lose slowing down the car at highway exits.</t5421>
<t5422>—We will stop four times to refuel.</t5422> <t5423>The stops will have to be very, very short.</t5423> <t5424>Six minutes maximum off the road.</t5424> <t5425>We will pass through three major construction zones, plus the traffic in Jacksonville, Washington, and Philadelphia, although it would be good if we crossed Washington around three in the morning.</t5425> <t5426>According to my calculations, our cruising speed should be one hundred fifteen kilometers per hour.</t5426> <t5427>What speed are you going?</t5427>
<t5428>—A hundred —I replied—.</t5428> <t5429>The limit is ninety.</t5429>
<t5430>—Put it at one hundred fifteen —he tells me.</t5430>
<t5431>—I can't.</t5431> <t5432>It's dangerous and they will fine me.</t5432>
<t5433>—Set it to one hundred fifteen —he repeats to me.</t5433>
<t5434>I floor the accelerator.</t5434> <t5435>The difficulty lies partly in that I can't decide to go at one hundred fifteen, and partly also that the minivan can't decide to go at one hundred fifteen.</t5435> <t5436>It starts to shake and it seems like it's going to fall apart.</t5436> <t5437>I'm still in the left lane, although I'm not the fastest car on the road and I feel bad that they have to overtake me on the right, but I need to keep the road clear, because, unlike the others, I can't slow down.</t5437> <t5438>And this is my role.</t5438> <t5439>My role is to drive and to get nervous.</t5439> <t5440>It occurs to me that I've played this role before.</t5440>
<t5441>And Ben?</t5441> <t5442>Ben's role is having to pee.</t5442> <t5443>At first, it seems like his main role is going to be complaining that we don't have a CD and that all the radio stations in Orlando are crap except for the university one, which we no longer get.</t5443> <t5444>But he quickly sets aside that role in favor of his true and faithful vocation: having to pee.</t5444>
<t5445>—I'm peeing myself —he says at 3:06.</t5445>
<t5446>We have been on the road for forty-three minutes.</t5446> <t5447>We have approximately one day of travel left.</t5447>
<t5448>—Well —says Radar—, the good news is that we will stop.</t5448> <t5449>The bad news is that it won't be for another four and a half hours.</t5449>
<t5450>—I think I'll hold on —Ben replies to him.</t5450>
<t5451>But at 3:10, he informs us:</t5451>
<t5452>—I really have to pee.</t5452> <t5453>Really.</t5453>
<t5454>—You deal with it —we answered in unison.</t5454>
<t5455>—But… —he says.</t5455>
<t5456>—You deal with it —we answered back in unison.</t5456>
<t5457>At the moment, it's funny that Ben has to pee and that we have to tell him to hold it in.</t5457> <t5458>He laughs and complains that if he laughs, he feels an even stronger urge to pee.</t5458> <t5459>Lacey jumps ahead, positions herself behind him, and starts tickling his waist.</t5459> <t5460>Ben laughs and complains, and I laugh too without letting the speed indicator drop below one hundred fifteen kilometers per hour.</t5460> <t5461>I wonder if Margo has orchestrated this joint trip on purpose or by accident, but in any case, it's the most fun I've had since the last time I spent hours behind the wheel of a minivan.</t5461>
<t5462>HOUR TWO</t5462>
<t5463>I keep driving.</t5463> <t5464>We turn north and get onto I-95 to head up the coast of Florida, though not exactly along the coast.</t5464> <t5465>Here, everything is pine trees that are too thin for their height, like me.</t5465> <t5466>But basically, I only see the road, I overtake cars and occasionally one overtakes us, I'm always attentive to those in front and those behind, to those approaching and those leaving the lane.</t5466>
<t5467>Now Lacey and Ben are sitting together, Radar is in the back seat, and they are playing a silly version of I spy that consists of saying only things that cannot be seen physically.</t5467>
<t5468>—I spy something tragically up-to-date —says Radar.</t5468>
<t5469>—Ben's crooked smile to the right? —asks Lacey.</t5469>
<t5470>—No —Radar replies—.</t5470> <t5471>And don't be so clingy with Ben.</t5471> <t5472>It's disgusting.</t5472>
<t5473>—The idea of traveling to New York without wearing anything under the robe, when the people in the cars passing us assume you're wearing a suit?</t5473>
<t5474>—No —Radar replies—.</t5474> <t5475>That is just tragic.</t5475>
<t5476>—In the end, you will like the dresses —says Lacey, smiling—.</t5476> <t5477>You enjoy the breeze.</t5477>
<t5478>—I know! —I say—.</t5478> <t5479>You see a twenty-four-hour road trip in a minivan.</t5479> <t5480>It's trendy because road trips are always trendy, and it's tragic because the gas this car guzzles will destroy the planet.</t5480>
<t5481>Radar says no and they keep trying to guess it.</t5481> <t5482>I maintain a speed of one hundred and fifteen kilometers per hour, pray that I don't get a ticket, and play metaphysical I spy.</t5482> <t5483>The tragically up-to-date thing turns out to be not being able to return the rented robes on time.</t5483> <t5484>I speed past a police car stopped in the grassy median.</t5484> <t5485>I grip the steering wheel tightly with both hands, convinced that it will chase us and make us stop.</t5485> <t5486>But no.</t5486> <t5487>Maybe the cop knows that I'm going at this speed because I have no other choice.</t5487>
<t5488>THREE O'CLOCK</t5488>
<t5489>Ben has sat back down in the passenger seat.</t5489> <t5490>I keep driving.</t5490> <t5491>We are all hungry.</t5491> <t5492>Lacey hands out a mint gum to each of us, but it is a poor consolation.</t5492> <t5493>She is making an endless list of everything we are going to buy at the gas station when we stop for the first time.</t5493> <t5494>It better be an exceptionally stocked gas station because we are going to clean it out.</t5494>
<t5495>Ben doesn't stop moving his legs.</t5495>
<t5496>—Do you want to stop?</t5496>
<t5497>—I've been needing to pee for three hours.</t5497>
<t5498>—You already said it.</t5498>
<t5499>—The piss has risen up to my ribs —he says—.</t5499> <t5500>Seriously, I'm up to my neck in it.</t5500> <t5501>Dude, right now seventy percent of my weight is piss.</t5501>
<t5502>—Wow —I say, barely managing a smile.</t5502>
<t5503>It's funny, I'm not saying it isn't, but I'm tired.</t5503>
<t5504>—I think that if I start crying, I'll cry pee.</t5504>
<t5505>This time, yes.</t5505> <t5506>I laugh a little.</t5506>
<t5507>The next time I take a look, a few minutes later, Ben has his toga lifted and is squeezing his groin with one hand.</t5507>
<t5508>—What the hell are you doing? —I ask him.</t5508>
<t5509>—Colleague, I need to get off.</t5509> <t5510>I really need to pee.</t5510> <t5511>—He turns around—.</t5511> <t5512>Radar, how much longer until we stop?</t5512>
<t5513>—We have to continue for at least two hundred and twenty more kilometers to not exceed four stops, that is, if Q maintains the pace, one hour and fifty-four point six minutes.</t5513>
<t5514>—I'm keeping the pace! —I exclaimed.</t5514>
<t5515>We are north of Jacksonville, approaching Georgia.</t5515>
<t5516>—I can't hold it, Radar.</t5516> <t5517>Give me something so I can pee.</t5517>
<t5518>We shouted in unison: NO.</t5518> <t5519>By no means.</t5519> <t5520>Endure it like a man.</t5520> <t5521>Keep it inside like a Victorian lady keeps her virginity.</t5521> <t5522>Hold it with dignity and elegance, as the President of the United States is supposed to hold the fate of the free world.</t5522>
<t5523>—IF YOU DON'T GIVE ME SOMETHING, I'M GOING TO PEE ON THE SEAT.</t5523> <t5524>AND QUICKLY!</t5524>
<t5525>—Fuck —says Radar, unbuckling his seatbelt.</t5525>
<t5526>He leans over the backrest, extends his arm, and opens the fridge.</t5526> <t5527>He sits back down, leans forward, and gives Ben a beer.</t5527>
<t5528>—Good thing the cap is a screw top —says Ben, covering his hand with a piece of toga and opening the bottle.</t5528>
<t5529>Ben lowers the window, and I watch through the side mirror as the stream of beer flies and splashes onto the road.</t5529> <t5530>Ben manages to get the bottle under his toga without us seeing the supposedly largest balls in the world, and the rest of us wait, because we're disgusted to look.</t5530>
<t5531>—You can't expect a... —Lacey begins to say.</t5531>
<t5532>But we all hear it.</t5532> <t5533>It's the first time I hear that sound, but I recognize it: the noise of pee hitting the bottom of a beer bottle.</t5533> <t5534>It almost sounds like music.</t5534> <t5535>Disgusting music at a very fast pace.</t5535> <t5536>I glance over and see the relief in Ben's eyes.</t5536> <t5537>He smiles looking ahead.</t5537>
<t5538>—The longer you wait, the better you feel —he says.</t5538>
<t5539>The tinkling of the pee hitting the bottle gives way to the sound of the stream of pee in the pee.</t5539> <t5540>And then Ben's smile slowly fades away.</t5540>
<t5541>—Colleague, I think I need another bottle —he says suddenly.</t5541>
<t5542>—Another bottle right now! —I shouted.</t5542>
<t5543>—Coming right up, another bottle!</t5543>
<t5544>In a second, I see Radar leaning over the backrest, with his head in the cooler, pulling out a bottle from the ice.</t5544> <t5545>He opens it directly, lowers a window, sticks out the bottle, and empties it.</t5545> <t5546>Then he jumps forward, sticks his head between Ben and me, and hands the bottle to Ben, who looks from side to side terrified.</t5546>
<t5547>—Ugh, it's going to be... complicated... to change the bottle —says Ben.</t5547>
<t5548>I see movements under his toga and try not to imagine what happens when a bottle of beer full of piss (which looks a lot like beer) appears from under a toga.</t5548> <t5549>Ben leaves the full bottle in the cup holder, takes the empty one from Radar's hand, and sighs with relief.</t5549>
<t5550>However, the rest of us cannot help but stare at the coaster's pee.</t5550> <t5551>The road does not have too many potholes, but the jolts of the minivan are quite significant, so the pee goes from one side to the other of the bottle's neck.</t5551>
<t5552>—Ben, if you splash my new car with piss, I'll cut your balls off.</t5552>
<t5553>He lifts his eyes towards me and throws me a superior smile without stopping peeing.</t5553>
<t5554>—You're going to need a giant knife, buddy —he replies to me.</t5554>
<t5555>And finally I hear that the stream weakens.</t5555> <t5556>It ends quickly, and with a swift motion, he throws the second bottle out the window.</t5556> <t5557>And then the first one.</t5557>
<t5558>Lacey pretends to gag, or maybe she really is gagging.</t5558>
<t5559>—Damn, did you wake up this morning and drink seventy liters of water? —says Radar.</t5559>
<t5560>But Ben is radiant.</t5560> <t5561>He raises his triumphant fist and shouts:</t5561>
<t5562>—Not a drop on the seat!</t5562> <t5563>I'm Ben Starling.</t5563> <t5564>First clarinet of the Winter Park band.</t5564> <t5565>Keg stand record holder.</t5565> <t5566>Champion of peeing in the car.</t5566> <t5567>Let the world tremble! I'm the best!</t5567>
<t5568>Thirty-five minutes later, when we have already been on the road for almost three hours, he asks in a low voice:</t5568>
<t5569>—When are we going to stop?</t5569>
<t5570>—In one hour and three minutes, if Q keeps the pace —Radar answers him.</t5570>
<t5571>—Okay —says Ben—. Okay. Fine.</t5571> <t5572>Because I have to pee.</t5572>
<t5573>HOUR FOUR</t5573>
<t5574>—Are we there yet? —asks Lacey for the first time.</t5574>
<t5575>We laughed.</t5575> <t5576>But we are in Georgia, a state I love and adore solely and exclusively for the following reason: the speed limit is one hundred and ten, which means I can go up to one hundred and twenty-five.</t5576> <t5577>Otherwise, Georgia reminds me of Florida.</t5577>
<t5578>We spent the fourth hour preparing for our first stop.</t5578> <t5579>It's an important stop because I am very very very very hungry and dehydrated.</t5579> <t5580>For some reason, talking about the food we are going to buy at the gas station eases the pangs.</t5580> <t5581>Lacey prepares a shopping list for each of us, which she writes in small letters on the back of the receipts she found in her purse.</t5581> <t5582>She asks Ben to lean out the passenger window to see which side the gas tank cap is on.</t5582> <t5583>She makes us memorize the list and then quizzes us on it.</t5583> <t5584>We review the gas station raid several times.</t5584> <t5585>It has to be as efficient as a pit stop.</t5585>
<t5586>—Again —says Lacey.</t5586>
<t5587>—I am the gas man —says Radar—.</t5587> <t5588>As soon as the tank starts filling up, I run inside while the pump is pumping gas, even though I'm not supposed to leave the pump at any time, and I give you the card.</t5588> <t5589>Then I go back to the pump.</t5589>
<t5590>—I give the card to the guy at the counter —says Lacey.</t5590>
<t5591>—Oh girl —I add.</t5591>
<t5592>—It's not important —Lacey answers me.</t5592>
<t5593>—I'm just saying... don't be so sexist.</t5593>
<t5594>—It doesn't matter, Q. I'll give the card to the person at the counter.</t5594> <t5595>I'll tell them to ring up everything we have.</t5595> <t5596>And I'm going to go pee.</t5596>
<t5597>—Meanwhile, I am picking up everything on my list and taking it to the counter —I add.</t5597>
<t5598>—And I'm peeing —says Ben—.</t5598> <t5599>When I finish peeing, I grab the things from my list.</t5599>
<t5600>—The most important thing is the T-shirts —says Radar—.</t5600> <t5601>People keep looking at me and smiling.</t5601>
<t5602>—I sign the ticket when I leave the bathroom —says Lacey.</t5602>
<t5603>—And as soon as the tank is full, I'm getting in the car and starting it, so you all better be inside.</t5603> <t5604>If not, I swear I'll leave you behind.</t5604> <t5605>You have six minutes —says Radar.</t5605>
<t5606>—Six minutes —I say, nodding.</t5606>
<t5607>—Six minutes —repeat Lacey and Ben as well.</t5607>
<t5608>At 5:35 in the afternoon, with fourteen hundred kilometers ahead of us, Radar informs us that, according to his computer, there is a BP gas station at the next exit.</t5608>
<t5609>As I enter the gas station, Lacey and Radar crouch behind the sliding door in the back.</t5609> <t5610>Ben, with his seatbelt unbuckled, has one hand on the passenger door handle and the other on the dashboard.</t5610> <t5611>I maintain the highest speed I can for as long as I can, and then brake hard in front of the gas pump.</t5611> <t5612>The minivan jerks and we rush out at full speed.</t5612> <t5613>Radar and I cross paths in front of the car.</t5613> <t5614>I toss him the keys and run towards the food section.</t5614> <t5615>Lacey and Ben push me against the doors, but it's not serious.</t5615> <t5616>While Ben runs to the bathroom, Lacey explains to the gray-haired woman (it is indeed a woman) that we are going to buy a lot of things, that we are in a huge hurry, and that she should start scanning the items as we bring them, charging everything to her BP card.</t5616> <t5617>The woman looks somewhat bewildered, but agrees.</t5617> <t5618>Radar runs in, with his gown flying, and hands the card to Lacey.</t5618>
<t5619>Meanwhile, I run through the aisles grabbing everything on my list.</t5619> <t5620>Lacey is on drinks, Ben on non-perishables, and I'm on food.</t5620> <t5621>I sweep through like a cheetah and the chips, wounded gazelles.</t5621> <t5622>I bring a handful of bags of chips, jerky, and peanuts to the counter, then run to the candy aisle.</t5622> <t5623>A handful of Mentos, a handful of Snickers and... Oh, it's not on the list, but I grab it, I love Nerds candies, so I add three boxes.</t5623> <t5624>I go back and head to the deli display, which is basically made up of stale turkey sandwiches where the turkey looks like ham.</t5624> <t5625>I grab two.</t5625> <t5626>Back at the checkout, I stop to grab a couple of packs of Starbursts, a pack of Twinkies, and an indeterminate amount of GoFast bars.</t5626> <t5627>I return to the checkout.</t5627> <t5628>Ben, in his graduation gown, hands the woman four-dollar t-shirts and sunglasses.</t5628> <t5629>Lacey runs with liters of sodas, energy drinks, and water.</t5629> <t5630>Big bottles, the kind that not even Ben could fill with one pee.</t5630>
<t5631>—ONE MINUTE! —shouts Lacey.</t5631>
<t5632>It almost gave me a heart attack.</t5632> <t5633>I wander around the store, trying to remember what I have forgotten.</t5633> <t5634>I take a look at my list.</t5634> <t5635>It seems like everything is there, but I have the feeling that I'm forgetting something important.</t5635> <t5636>Something.</t5636> <t5637>"Come on, Jacobsen."</t5637> <t5638>Chips, candies, turkey sandwiches that look like ham... and what else?</t5638> <t5639>What other types of food are there?</t5639> <t5640>Meat, chips, candies and, and, and, and cheese! CRACKERS!, I shout out loud.</t5640> <t5641>I run towards the crackers, grab several packs with cheese and with peanut butter, and some grandma's cookies just in case, run back to the counter and put everything on the counter.</t5641> <t5642>The woman has already filled four plastic bags.</t5642> <t5643>Almost a hundred dollars in total, not counting the gas.</t5643> <t5644>I'll have to spend the summer paying back Lacey's parents.</t5644>
<t5645>The only moment of pause is after the cashier has swiped Lacey's card.</t5645> <t5646>I look at the clock.</t5646> <t5647>We are supposed to leave in twenty seconds.</t5647> <t5648>I finally hear the ticket printing.</t5648> <t5649>The woman tears it from the machine, Lacey scribbles her signature, and Ben and I grab the bags and run to the car.</t5649> <t5650>Radar revs the engine, as if telling us to hurry up, and we run through the parking lot.</t5650> <t5651>With Ben's gown flying in the wind, he has a slight resemblance to a wizard, except that you can see his white legs and he is carrying plastic bags in his hands.</t5651> <t5652>I see the back of Lacey's legs under her dress, moving forward with tight calves.</t5652> <t5653>I don't know what I look like, but I know how I feel: young.</t5653> <t5654>Clumsy. Infinite.</t5654> <t5655>I watch Lacey and Ben entering through the sliding door.</t5655> <t5656>Then I enter, landing on top of plastic bags and on Lacey's torso.</t5656> <t5657>Radar starts the car as I close the door and speeds out of the parking lot, marking the first time in the long and notorious history of minivans that someone uses one to burn rubber.</t5657> <t5658>Radar turns left onto the highway at an unsafe speed and we get back on the interstate.</t5658> <t5659>We are four seconds ahead of schedule.</t5659> <t5660>And like in a NASCAR pit stop, we high-five and pat each other on the back.</t5660> <t5661>We are well-stocked.</t5661> <t5662>Ben has a bunch of pee containers.</t5662> <t5663>I have plenty of beef jerky rations.</t5663> <t5664>Lacey has her Mentos.</t5664> <t5665>Radar and Ben have t-shirts to put over their gowns.</t5665> <t5666>The minivan has become a biosphere.</t5666> <t5667>With gasoline, we can keep going forever.</t5667>
<t5668>FIVE O'CLOCK</t5668>
<t5669>Alright, on second thought, maybe we are not as well-stocked as we thought.</t5669> <t5670>In the rush, it turns out that Ben and I have made several minor (though not fatal) mistakes.</t5670> <t5671>Radar goes ahead alone, and Ben and I sit in the front row of seats, take things out of the bags, and pass them to Lacey, who is behind us.</t5671> <t5672>For her part, Lacey arranges the items into piles following an organizational system that only she understands.</t5672>
<t5673>—Why doesn't the antihistamine go in the same pile as the caffeine pills? —I ask—.</t5673> <t5674>Shouldn't all the medications go together?</t5674>
<t5675>—Q, darling, you are a kid.</t5675> <t5676>You don't know how these things work.</t5676> <t5677>Caffeine goes with chocolate and Mountain Dew, which also have caffeine, which helps to keep you awake.</t5677> <t5678>The antihistamine, which makes you sleepy, goes with jerky because eating meat makes you tired.</t5678>
<t5679>—Fascinating —I replied.</t5679>
<t5680>I pass the remaining food in the last bag to Lacey.</t5680>
<t5681>—Q —he says to me—, where is the food that… you know… the food?</t5681>
<t5682>—How?</t5682>
<t5683>Lacey takes out a copy of the list she made for me and reads it.</t5683>
<t5684>—Bananas, apples, dried cranberries, and raisins.</t5684>
<t5685>—Ah —I say—.</t5685> <t5686>Ah, okay.</t5686> <t5687>The fourth group wasn't salty crackers.</t5687>
<t5688>—What! —she exclaims furiously—.</t5688> <t5689>I can't eat any of this!</t5689>
<t5690>Ben grabs her by the elbow.</t5690>
<t5691>—Well, but you can eat grandma's cookies.</t5691> <t5692>They won't make you feel bad.</t5692> <t5693>Grandma made them.</t5693> <t5694>And grandma would never hurt you.</t5694>
<t5695>Lacey blows a strand of hair away from her face.</t5695> <t5696>She looks very annoyed.</t5696>
<t5697>—Besides —I tell him—, there are energy bars.</t5697> <t5698>They are fortified with vitamins!</t5698>
<t5699>—Yes, vitamins and about thirty grams of fat —he replies to me.</t5699>
<t5700>—Stop talking bad about energy bars —intervenes Radar—.</t5700> <t5701>Do you want me to stop the car?</t5701>
<t5702>—Every time I eat a bar —says Ben— I think this is what blood tastes like to mosquitoes.</t5702>
<t5703>I unwrap halfway a chocolate and dulce de leche sponge cake bar and bring it close to Lacey's mouth.</t5703>
<t5704>—Smell it —I tell him—.</t5704> <t5705>Smell the vitamin-rich delicacy.</t5705>
<t5706>—You're going to make me gain weight.</t5706>
<t5707>—And to get covered in pimples —said Ben—.</t5707> <t5708>Don't forget the pimples.</t5708>
<t5709>Lacey grabs the bar and takes a reluctant bite.</t5709> <t5710>She has to close her eyes to hide the orgasmic pleasure inherent in eating an energy bar.</t5710>
<t5711>—My goodness!</t5711> <t5712>A hopeful taste.</t5712>
<t5713>In the end, we opened the last bag.</t5713> <t5714>It contains two large t-shirts, which excite Radar and Ben, because they will allow them to be guys with a giant t-shirt over a ridiculous toga instead of just guys with a ridiculous toga.</t5714>
<t5715>But when Ben unfolds the T-shirts, he encounters two small problems.</t5715> <t5716>The first is that it turns out a large-sized T-shirt from a gas station in Georgia is not the same size as a large-sized T-shirt from, say, a department store.</t5716> <t5717>The gas station T-shirt is enormous.</t5717> <t5718>It looks more like a garbage bag than a T-shirt.</t5718> <t5719>It's smaller than the togas, but not by much.</t5719> <t5720>But this problem almost pales in comparison to the other, which is that both T-shirts have the Confederate flag printed on them.</t5720> <t5721>Above the flag, it reads HERITAGE NOT HATE.</t5721>
<t5722>—Oh, no —says Radar when I show him why we are laughing—.</t5722> <t5723>Ben Starling, you shouldn't have bought a racist T-shirt for the person who covers your black friend quota.</t5723>
<t5724>—I grabbed the first ones I saw, mate.</t5724>
<t5725>—Don't come at me with "buddy" now —says Radar, though he shakes his head and laughs.</t5725> <t5726>I hand him his t-shirt.</t5726> <t5727>He holds the steering wheel with his knees and puts it on—.</t5727> <t5728>I hope the cops pull me over.</t5728> <t5729>I'd love to see the look on their faces when they see a Black guy with a Confederate t-shirt over a black toga.</t5729>
<t5730>SIX O'CLOCK</t5730>
<t5731>For some reason, the stretch of I-95 south of Florence, South Carolina, is the ideal place to drive on a Friday night.</t5731> <t5732>We got stuck for several miles in traffic, and although Radar is desperate to exceed the speed limit, he can hopefully go fifty.</t5732> <t5733>Radar and I are in the front trying not to worry by playing a game we just invented called "That Guy is a Gigolo."</t5733> <t5734>It consists of imagining the lives of the people in the cars around us.</t5734>
<t5735>We go next to a Hispanic woman driving an old and dilapidated Toyota Corolla.</t5735> <t5736>I observe her in the early darkness.</t5736>
<t5737>—She left her family to come here —I say—.</t5737> <t5738>Without papers.</t5738> <t5739>She sends money home on the third Tuesday of every month.</t5739> <t5740>She has two small children.</t5740> <t5741>Her husband is an immigrant.</t5741> <t5742>At the moment, she lives in Ohio.</t5742> <t5743>She only spends three or four months a year at home, but her family manages quite well.</t5743>
<t5744>Radar leans forward and looks at her for a second.</t5744>
<t5745>—Come on, Q, it's not as melodramatic as you make it out to be.</t5745> <t5746>She is a secretary at a law firm.</t5746> <t5747>Look at how she's dressed.</t5747> <t5748>It took her five years, but she's about to get her law degree too.</t5748> <t5749>She has no kids or husband.</t5749> <t5750>But she has a boyfriend who is somewhat inconsistent.</t5750> <t5751>He's scared of commitment.</t5751> <t5752>A white guy who gets turned on by the ethnic vibe.</t5752>
<t5753>—She wears a wedding ring —I pointed out.</t5753>
<t5754>I must say, in Radar's defense, that I have been able to observe her better.</t5754> <t5755>She is to my right, just below me.</t5755> <t5756>I see her through the tinted windows of her car.</t5756> <t5757>I watch her singing and staring straight ahead without blinking.</t5757> <t5758>There are a lot of people.</t5758> <t5759>It's easy to forget how full of people the world is, crowded, and each one of them is susceptible to being imagined and, therefore, imagined wrongly.</t5759> <t5760>I get the impression that it's an important idea, one of those ideas that your brain has to mull over very slowly, like pythons when they eat, but before I can take it a step further, Radar intervenes.</t5760>
<t5761>—She wears it so that perverts like you don't approach her —he explains to me.</t5761>
<t5762>—It could be.</t5762>
<t5763>I smile.</t5763> <t5764>I pick up the half energy bar that I had left on my knees and take a bite.</t5764> <t5765>For a moment we remain silent and I think about how we see and don't see people, about the tinted windows that separate me from that woman driving to our right, about how the two cars, with windows and mirrors everywhere, move together at a snail's pace on this crowded highway.</t5765> <t5766>When Radar starts to speak, I realize that he has also been thinking.</t5766>
<t5767>—The thing about "This guy is a gigolo" —says Radar—, well, I mean as a game itself, is that in the end it says much more about the person imagining than the person being imagined.</t5767>
<t5768>—Yes —I answered him—.</t5768> <t5769>I was thinking the same thing.</t5769>
<t5770>And I can't help but feel that Whitman, for his furious beauty, might have been too optimistic.</t5770> <t5771>We can hear others, and we can travel to them without moving, and we can imagine them, and we are all connected by a crazy root system, like leaves of grass, but the game makes me wonder if we can really become totally another.</t5771>
<t5772>HOUR SEVEN</t5772>
<t5773>In the end, we passed by a truck whose trailer had become detached, and we accelerated again, but Radar mentally calculates that from here to Agloe we will have to maintain an average speed of one hundred and twenty-five kilometers per hour.</t5773> <t5774>It has been an hour since Ben announced that he needed to pee, and for a simple reason: he is sleeping.</t5774> <t5775>At six o'clock sharp, he took an antihistamine.</t5775> <t5776>He lay down in the back seat and Lacey and I fastened both seat belts for him, which made him feel even more uncomfortable, but 1) it was for his own good, and 2) we all knew that in twenty minutes he wouldn't care in the slightest about being uncomfortable, because he would be sleeping like a log.</t5776> <t5777>And right now he is.</t5777> <t5778>We will wake him up at twelve.</t5778> <t5779>A moment ago, at nine, I positioned Lacey to sleep in the back seat, in the same position.</t5779> <t5780>We will wake her up at two.</t5780> <t5781>The idea is that everyone sleeps in shifts so that tomorrow, when we arrive in Agloe, we won't be falling asleep.</t5781>
<t5782>The minivan has turned into a kind of tiny house.</t5782> <t5783>I am sitting in the passenger seat, which is the living room.</t5783> <t5784>I think it is the best room in the house.</t5784> <t5785>It is spacious and the seat is very comfortable.</t5785>
<t5786>Scattered across the carpet under the passenger seat is the dispatch, which contains a map of the United States that Ben picked up at the gas station, the routes I printed out, and the piece of paper on which Radar did the calculations about speed and distance.</t5786>
<t5787>Radar is in the driver's seat.</t5787> <t5788>The dining room.</t5788> <t5789>It looks a lot like the living room, but in the dining room, you can't relax as much.</t5789> <t5790>It's also cleaner.</t5790>
<t5791>Between the dining room and the living room, we have the central compartment, or the kitchen.</t5791> <t5792>Here we have a good supply of jerky, bars, and a magical energy drink called Bluefin, which Lacey had added to the shopping list.</t5792> <t5793>Bluefin is packaged in small, oddly-shaped glass bottles and tastes like blue cotton candy.</t5793> <t5794>It also keeps you awake better than anything else in the history of humanity, although it makes you a bit nervous.</t5794> <t5795>Radar and I have decided to take it up to two hours before our rest shift.</t5795> <t5796>Mine starts at twelve, when Ben gets up.</t5796>
<t5797>The first row of seats is the first room.</t5797> <t5798>It is the least comfortable because it is near the kitchen and the living room, where people are awake chatting and sometimes the radio is on.</t5798>
<t5799>Behind is the second room, which is darker, quieter, and better than the first.</t5799>
<t5800>And behind it is the refrigerator, or the fridge, which at this moment contains 210 beers that Ben has not yet peed in, the turkey sandwiches that look like ham, and several Coca-Colas.</t5800>
<t5801>The house is highly recommended.</t5801> <t5802>It is carpeted from top to bottom.</t5802> <t5803>It has air conditioning and central heating.</t5803> <t5804>It is equipped with speakers.</t5804> <t5805>It is true that the living space is only five square meters, but the spaciousness is unbeatable.</t5805>
<t5806>EIGHT O'CLOCK</t5806>
<t5807>Just after entering South Carolina, I catch Radar yawning and insist on driving.</t5807> <t5808>Anyway, I like driving.</t5808> <t5809>Sure, we're talking about a minivan, but it's my minivan.</t5809> <t5810>Radar shifts to one side of the seat and goes into the first room while I grip the steering wheel tightly, jump over the kitchen, and settle into the driver's seat.</t5810>
<t5811>I'm discovering that by traveling you learn many things about yourself.</t5811> <t5812>For example, I never thought I would be one of those people who pee in an almost empty bottle of Bluefin energy drink while driving through South Carolina at one hundred fifteen kilometers per hour, but it turns out I am.</t5812> <t5813>Additionally, I didn't know that if you mix a bunch of pee with a little Bluefin, the result is a surprisingly bright turquoise color.</t5813> <t5814>It's so pretty that it makes me want to put the cap on the bottle and leave it on the dashboard for Lacey and Ben to see when they wake up.</t5814>
<t5815>But Radar does not think the same.</t5815>
<t5816>"If you don't throw that crap out the window right now, I'll end our eleven years of friendship," he tells me.</t5816>
<t5817>—It's not shit —he replied—.</t5817> <t5818>It's pee.</t5818>
<t5819>—Out —he says to me.</t5819>
<t5820>So I throw it.</t5820> <t5821>I see it in the side mirror landing on the asphalt and exploding like a water-filled balloon.</t5821> <t5822>Radar sees it too.</t5822>
<t5823>—Fuck —says Radar—.</t5823> <t5824>I hope this is one of those traumatic episodes that hurt my sensitivity so much that I directly forget they happened.</t5824>
<t5825>NINE O'CLOCK</t5825>
<t5826>I didn't know it was possible to get tired of eating energy bars.</t5826> <t5827>But it is.</t5827> <t5828>I've only taken two bites of the fourth one today and my stomach turned.</t5828> <t5829>I open the middle glove compartment and leave it there.</t5829> <t5830>We call this part of the kitchen the pantry.</t5830>
<t5831>—I wish we had apples —says Radar—.</t5831> <t5832>Damn, wouldn't an apple be fantastic right now?</t5832>
<t5833>Sigh.</t5833> <t5834>Damn fourth group.</t5834> <t5835>Besides, even though I stopped drinking Bluefin hours ago, I'm still extremely nervous.</t5835>
<t5836>—I'm still very nervous —I say.</t5836>
<t5837>—Yes —Radar answers me—.</t5837> <t5838>I can't keep my fingers still.</t5838>
<t5839>I take a look and see him drumming his fingers on his knees.</t5839>
<t5840>—I really can't stop —he tells me.</t5840>
<t5841>—Well, I'm not tired, so we'll continue until four, then we'll wake them up and go to sleep until eight.</t5841>
<t5842>—Okay —he answers me.</t5842>
<t5843>We remained silent.</t5843> <t5844>Now the road has become empty.</t5844> <t5845>It's just me and the trucks, and I feel like my brain is processing information at a rate eleven thousand times faster than usual.</t5845> <t5846>I suddenly think that what I'm doing is very easy, that driving on the highway is the easiest and most pleasant thing in the world.</t5846> <t5847>The only thing I have to do is stay between the lines, make sure no one gets too close to me and that I don't get too close to anyone, and keep moving forward.</t5847> <t5848>Maybe Margo felt the same way too, but I would never have felt this way on my own.</t5848>
<t5849>Radar breaks the silence.</t5849>
<t5850>—Well, if we're not going to sleep until four...</t5850>
<t5851>He finished his sentence:</t5851>
<t5852>—Yes, maybe we could open another bottle of Bluefin.</t5852>
<t5853>And we opened it.</t5853>
<t5854>TEN O'CLOCK</t5854>
<t5855>The time has come to stop again.</t5855> <t5856>It is 12:13 at night.</t5856> <t5857>My fingers do not seem like fingers.</t5857> <t5858>They seem like pure motion.</t5858> <t5859>They tap on the steering wheel as I drive.</t5859>
<t5860>Radar searches on the computer for the next BP gas station and we decide to wake up Lacey and Ben.</t5860>
<t5861>—Hey, guys, let's stop —I tell them.</t5861>
<t5862>They do not react.</t5862>
<t5863>Radar turns and places a hand on Lacey's shoulder.</t5863>
<t5864>—Lace, it's time to get up.</t5864>
<t5865>Nothing.</t5865>
<t5866>I turn on the radio and find a station playing old songs.</t5866> <t5867>The Beatles are playing, the song "Good Morning."</t5867> <t5868>I turn up the volume.</t5868> <t5869>They don't react.</t5869> <t5870>Then Radar turns it up even more.</t5870> <t5871>And more.</t5871> <t5872>And when the chorus comes, he starts singing.</t5872> <t5873>And I start singing too.</t5873> <t5874>I think what finally wakes them up are my off-key notes.</t5874>
<t5875>—TURN THAT OFF! —yells Ben.</t5875>
<t5876>We turned off the music.</t5876>
<t5877>—Ben, let's stop.</t5877> <t5878>Do you need to pee?</t5878>
<t5879>Silence.</t5879> <t5880>I hear noise in the back and wonder if he has some strategy to check the level of his bladder.</t5880>
<t5881>—I think I'm doing well —he answers me.</t5881>
<t5882>—Okay, then you take care of the gasoline.</t5882>
<t5883>—Since I'm the only guy who hasn't peed in the car yet, I ask to go to the bathroom first —says Radar.</t5883>
<t5884>—Shush —murmurs Lacey—.</t5884> <t5885>Shush.</t5885> <t5886>Everyone be quiet.</t5886>
<t5887>—Lacey, you have to get up and pee —says Radar—.</t5887> <t5888>We're going to stop.</t5888>
<t5889>—Buy apples —I tell him.</t5889>
<t5890>—Apples —she murmurs contentedly with a pretty feminine voice—.</t5890> <t5891>I love apples.</t5891>
<t5892>—And then you have to drive —Radar tells him—, so wake up already.</t5892>
<t5893>He sits up and, with his usual voice, says:</t5893>
<t5894>—That doesn't thrill me as much anymore.</t5894>
<t5895>We go in through the exit.</t5895> <t5896>The gas station is a kilometer and a half away, which isn't much, but Radar says we'll probably lose four minutes, that South Carolina traffic has made us lose time, and that we could run into serious problems in an hour when the construction starts.</t5896> <t5897>But I don't allow myself to worry.</t5897> <t5898>Lacey and Ben have woken up enough to position themselves by the sliding door, like last time, and when we stop in front of the pump, we all run out.</t5898> <t5899>I throw the keys to Ben, who catches them in the air.</t5899>
<t5900>Radar and I zoom past the man at the counter like a flash, but Radar stops when he notices the guy staring at him intently.</t5900>
<t5901>—Yes —Radar says to him calmly—, I'm wearing a CULTURAL HERITAGE NOT HATE t-shirt over my graduation gown.</t5901> <t5902>By the way, are you wearing pants?</t5902>
<t5903>The guy looks at him puzzled.</t5903>
<t5904>—We have camouflage pants next to the motor oil.</t5904>
<t5905>—Perfect —Radar replies.</t5905> <t5906>And then he turns to me and says—:</t5906> <t5907>Be a pal and grab me some camouflage pants.</t5907> <t5908>And maybe a T-shirt?</t5908>
<t5909>—It's done —I answered him.</t5909>
<t5910>It turns out that camouflage pants don't come in the usual sizes.</t5910> <t5911>There are only medium and large.</t5911> <t5912>I grab a pair of medium ones and a large pink t-shirt that says THE BEST GRANDMA IN THE WORLD.</t5912> <t5913>I also grab three bottles of Bluefin.</t5913>
<t5914>I hand everything to Lacey when she comes out of the bathroom and I go into the girls' bathroom, because Radar is still in the boys' bathroom.</t5914> <t5915>I don't remember if I had ever been in a gas station's girls' bathroom before.</t5915>
<t5916>Differences:</t5916>
<t5917>There is no condom machine</t5917>
<t5918>Fewer paintings</t5918>
<t5919>There are no urinals</t5919>
<t5920>The smell is more or less the same, which I find quite disappointing.</t5920>
<t5921>When I come out, Lacey is paying and Ben is honking the horn.</t5921> <t5922>After a moment of confusion, I run to the car.</t5922>
<t5923>—We have lost a minute —says Ben from the passenger seat.</t5923>
<t5924>Lacey gets on the road that will take us back to the highway.</t5924>
<t5925>—Sorry —says Radar from the back seat, where he is sitting next to me, putting on his camouflage pants under his gown—.</t5925> <t5926>But at least I have pants.</t5926> <t5927>And another t-shirt.</t5927> <t5928>Where's the t-shirt, Q?</t5928>
<t5929>Lacey gives it to her.</t5929>
<t5930>—Very funny.</t5930>
<t5931>He takes off his shirt and puts on his grandmother's.</t5931> <t5932>Ben complains that no one has bought him any pants.</t5932> <t5933>He says his butt itches.</t5933> <t5934>And thinking about it, he feels like peeing.</t5934>
<t5935>ELEVEN O'CLOCK</t5935>
<t5936>We arrived at the construction site.</t5936> <t5937>The highway narrows to one lane and we get stuck behind a trailer that is going exactly at the speed limit for roads under construction, sixty kilometers per hour.</t5937> <t5938>Lacey is the best driver in these situations.</t5938> <t5939>I would be pounding the steering wheel, but she calmly chats with Ben until she turns and says:</t5939>
<t5940>—Q, I really need to go to the bathroom, and anyway, we're wasting time behind this truck.</t5940>
<t5941>Seat.</t5941> <t5942>I can't blame her.</t5942> <t5943>I would have forced a stop a while ago if I couldn't pee in a bottle.</t5943> <t5944>It was heroic that she had held on for so long.</t5944>
<t5945>He pulls into a gas station that's open all night and I get out to stretch my legs.</t5945> <t5946>When Lacey comes running back to the car, I'm sitting in the driver's seat.</t5946> <t5947>I don't even know how I ended up in that seat, why I'm there instead of Lacey.</t5947> <t5948>She walks around to the front door and sees me.</t5948> <t5949>The window is rolled down.</t5949>
<t5950>—I can drive —I tell him.</t5950>
<t5951>After all, it is my car.</t5951> <t5952>And my mission.</t5952>
<t5953>—Are you sure? —he asks me.</t5953>
<t5954>—Yes, yes, I can continue.</t5954>
<t5955>He opens the sliding door and lies down on the first seat.</t5955>
<t5956>SWEET HOUR</t5956>
<t5957>It is 2:40 in the morning.</t5957> <t5958>Lacey is sleeping.</t5958> <t5959>Radar is sleeping.</t5959> <t5960>I am driving.</t5960> <t5961>The road is deserted.</t5961> <t5962>Even most of the truckers have gone to sleep.</t5962> <t5963>For many minutes, I do not see any lights ahead.</t5963> <t5964>Ben is next to me and keeps me company to keep me awake.</t5964> <t5965>We chat about Margo.</t5965>
<t5966>—Have you thought about how we are going to find Agloe? —he asks me.</t5966>
<t5967>—Well, I have a slight idea of where the crossing is —I reply—.</t5967> <t5968>And it's just a crossing.</t5968>
<t5969>—And is Margo going to be in a corner, sitting on the car trunk, waiting for you with her chin resting on her hands?</t5969>
<t5970>—It would be a nice gesture —I reply to him.</t5970>
<t5971>—Colleague, I have to tell you that I am a little worried that... if things don't go as you have planned, you will be greatly disappointed.</t5971>
<t5972>—I just want to find her —I tell him, and it's true.</t5972>
<t5973>I just want her to be alive and safe.</t5973> <t5974>To find her.</t5974> <t5975>Let the thread follow its course.</t5975> <t5976>The rest is secondary.</t5976>
<t5977>—Yes, but... I don't know —says Ben.</t5977> <t5978>I notice that he is looking at me very seriously—.</t5978> <t5979>But...</t5979> <t5980>But remember that sometimes people are not how you think they are.</t5980> <t5981>For example, I always thought that Lacey was really hot, that she was incredible and cool, but now, when I'm actually with her... it's not the same.</t5981> <t5982>People are different when you can smell them and see them up close, you know?</t5982>
<t5983>—I know —I reply to him.</t5983>
<t5984>I know that for a long time I have been wrong, and very much so, imagining her.</t5984>
<t5985>—I’m just saying that it used to be easy for me to like Lacey.</t5985> <t5986>It’s easy to like someone from a distance.</t5986> <t5987>But when it stops being something incredible and unattainable and starts being a normal girl, with a strange relationship with food, quite grumpy and bossy… then basically I have to start liking a totally different person.</t5987>
<t5988>I feel my cheeks burning.</t5988>
<t5989>—Are you telling me that I don't actually like Margo?</t5989> <t5990>After all this...</t5990> <t5991>I've been stuck in this car for twelve hours and you think I don't care about Margo because I don't...</t5991> <t5992>—I interrupt myself—.</t5992> <t5993>You think that just because you have a girlfriend you can climb up the mountain and preach to me?</t5993> <t5994>Sometimes you are so...</t5994>
<t5995>I stay silent because at the end of the headlights' light, I see something that will soon kill me.</t5995>
<t5996>In the middle of the highway, there are two cows so calm.</t5996> <t5997>They suddenly appear in my field of vision, one cow with black spots in the left lane, and in our lane, an immense creature, the size of our car, completely motionless, with its head turned back, staring at us with blank eyes.</t5997> <t5998>It is absolutely white, an enormous white wall of cow that we cannot jump over, pass under, or avoid.</t5998> <t5999>We can only crash into it.</t5999> <t6000>I know that Ben sees it too, because I hear him stop breathing.</t6000>
<t6001>They say that life flashes before your eyes, but in my case, it isn't like that.</t6001> <t6002>Nothing flashes before my eyes except that enormous expanse of white fur, now just a second away from us.</t6002> <t6003>I don't know what to do.</t6003> <t6004>No, that's not the problem.</t6004> <t6005>The problem is that there's nothing to do, except crash into that white wall, kill it and kill ourselves.</t6005> <t6006>I hit the brakes, but out of habit, without expectations.</t6006> <t6007>There's no way to avoid it.</t6007> <t6008>I don't know why, but I raise my hands, as if surrendering.</t6008> <t6009>I think about the most banal thing in the world: that I don't want it to happen.</t6009> <t6010>I don't want to die.</t6010> <t6011>I don't want my friends to die.</t6011> <t6012>And to be honest, as time slows down and my hands are in the air, I allow myself to think of one more thing, and I think of Margo.</t6012> <t6013>I blame her for this ridiculous and fatal chase... for putting us in danger, for turning me into an idiot who spends the night sleepless and drives too fast.</t6013> <t6014>I wouldn't be about to die if it weren't for her.</t6014> <t6015>I would have stayed home, as always, and would have been safe, and would have done the only thing I've always wanted to do, which is to grow up.</t6015>
<t6016>Although I have abandoned control of the ship, I am surprised to see a hand on the wheel.</t6016> <t6017>We turn before I realize why we are turning, and then I see that Ben is turning the wheel towards him, turning in a desperate attempt to avoid the cow, and suddenly we are on the shoulder and then on the grass.</t6017> <t6018>I hear the tires as Ben turns the wheel sharply in the opposite direction.</t6018> <t6019>I stop looking.</t6019> <t6020>I don't know if I close my eyes or if I simply stop seeing.</t6020> <t6021>My stomach crashes into my lungs and they crush each other.</t6021> <t6022>Something sharp hits me on the cheek.</t6022> <t6023>We stop.</t6023>
<t6024>I don't know why, but I touch my face.</t6024> <t6025>I withdraw my hand and see a bloodstain.</t6025> <t6026>I touch my arms, as if hugging myself, although I'm just checking if they're there, and they are.</t6026> <t6027>I look at my legs.</t6027> <t6028>They're there.</t6028> <t6029>There is glass.</t6029> <t6030>I look around.</t6030> <t6031>The bottles have broken.</t6031> <t6032>Ben looks at me.</t6032> <t6033>He touches his face.</t6033> <t6034>He seems to be okay.</t6034> <t6035>He runs his hands over his body like I do.</t6035> <t6036>His body still works.</t6036> <t6037>He just looks at me.</t6037> <t6038>I see the cow in the rearview mirror.</t6038> <t6039>And now, belatedly, Ben screams.</t6039> <t6040>He looks at me and screams with his mouth wide open, a deep, guttural, and terrified scream.</t6040> <t6041>He stops screaming.</t6041> <t6042>Something is happening to me.</t6042> <t6043>I feel like I'm fainting.</t6043> <t6044>My chest burns.</t6044> <t6045>Then I gasp for air.</t6045> <t6046>I had forgotten to breathe.</t6046> <t6047>I had been holding my breath all that time.</t6047> <t6048>I feel much better when I catch it.</t6048> <t6049>“Inhale through the nose, exhale through the mouth.”</t6049>
<t6050>—Who is hurt? —shouts Lacey.</t6050>
<t6051>He has unbuckled his seatbelt, sits up, and leans towards the back.</t6051> <t6052>When I turn around, I see that the back door has opened, and for a moment I think Radar has shot out of the car, but suddenly he gets up.</t6052> <t6053>He runs his hands over his face.</t6053>
<t6054>—I'm fine.</t6054> <t6055>I'm fine.</t6055> <t6056>Are you all okay? —he asks.</t6056>
<t6057>Lacey doesn't even answer.</t6057> <t6058>She jumps forward, between Ben and me.</t6058> <t6059>She leans on the kitchen counter and looks at Ben.</t6059>
<t6060>—Honey, where did you hurt yourself?</t6060>
<t6061>Her eyes are filled with water, like a swimming pool on a rainy day.</t6061>
<t6062>—I'm fine, I'm fine. You're bleeding.</t6062>
<t6063>She turns towards me, and I shouldn't cry, but I cry, not because it hurts, but because I'm scared, I raised my hands, and Ben has saved us, and now this girl looks at me, and she looks at me like a mother, and I shouldn't break, but I break.</t6063> <t6064>I know the cut on my cheek is not serious, and I try to say it, but I keep crying.</t6064> <t6065>Lacey presses the cut with her fingers, thin and soft, and yells at Ben to give her something that can serve as a bandage, and suddenly I have a strip of the Confederate flag stuck to my cheek, just to the right of my nose.</t6065>
<t6066>—Squeeze it for a moment —he tells me—.</t6066> <t6067>It's nothing.</t6067> <t6068>Did you hurt yourself more?</t6068>
<t6069>I tell him no.</t6069> <t6070>Then I realize that the car is still running, that it is only stopped because I am still pressing the brake.</t6070> <t6071>I put it in neutral and turn it off.</t6071> <t6072>When I turn it off, I hear it leaking fluid.</t6072> <t6073>More than dripping, it's gushing.</t6073>
<t6074>—I think we should leave —says Radar.</t6074>
<t6075>I keep the Confederate flag stuck to my face.</t6075> <t6076>I continue to hear the sound of the liquid.</t6076>
<t6077>—It's gasoline! It's going to explode! —shouts Ben.</t6077>
<t6078>He opens the passenger door and runs out, terrified.</t6078> <t6079>He jumps a fence and runs through a hayfield.</t6079> <t6080>I also get out, though not as quickly.</t6080> <t6081>Radar is also out, and while Ben runs away, he laughs.</t6081>
<t6082>—It's the beer —he says.</t6082>
<t6083>—What?</t6083>
<t6084>—All the beers have broken —he says again, pointing to the fridge, which is open and from which liters of foamy liquid are dripping.</t6084>
<t6085>We tried to call Ben, who doesn't hear us because he is busy shouting "IT'S GOING TO EXPLODE!" while running across the field.</t6085> <t6086>His toga flies in the grayish dawn light, and his bony butt is visible.</t6086>
<t6087>I hear a car, so I turn around and look towards the highway.</t6087> <t6088>The white beast and its spotted friend have calmly arrived, safe and sound, at the other shoulder, unperturbed.</t6088> <t6089>When I turn around again, I see that the minivan is against the fence.</t6089>
<t6090>I am assessing the damages when Ben finally returns reluctantly.</t6090> <t6091>When we turned, we must have grazed the fence, because there is a deep dent in the sliding door, so deep that if you get close, you can see inside the car.</t6091> <t6092>But otherwise, it looks immaculate.</t6092> <t6093>There are no more dents.</t6093> <t6094>No broken windows.</t6094> <t6095>No flat tires.</t6095> <t6096>I am going to close the back door and observe the 210 broken beer bottles, still bubbling.</t6096> <t6097>Lacey comes up to me and puts an arm around my shoulders.</t6097> <t6098>We both watch the stream of foam flowing towards the ditch on the side of the road.</t6098>
<t6099>—What happened? —he asks me.</t6099>
<t6100>I'll tell you: we were dead, but Ben managed to turn the car in the right direction, as if it were a brilliant vehicular ballerina.</t6100>
<t6101>Ben and Radar have crawled under the minivan.</t6101> <t6102>Neither of them knows a damn thing about cars, but I guess it makes them feel better.</t6102> <t6103>On one side, the hem of Ben's toga and his bare butt are sticking out.</t6103>
<t6104>—Uncle —shouts Radar—, it looks like it's perfect.</t6104>
<t6105>—Radar —I tell him—, the car has spun about eight times.</t6105> <t6106>It's surely not in perfect condition.</t6106>
<t6107>—Well, it seems perfect —says Radar.</t6107>
<t6108>—Hey —I say, grabbing Ben's New Balance shoes—.</t6108> <t6109>Hey, come on, get out of there.</t6109>
<t6110>He comes out crawling, I extend my hand and pull him up to help him stand.</t6110> <t6111>His hands are stained with grease.</t6111> <t6112>I hug him.</t6112> <t6113>If I hadn't let go of the steering wheel, and if he hadn't taken control so skillfully, I'm sure I would be dead.</t6113>
<t6114>—Thanks —I say, patting him on the back, probably too hard—.</t6114> <t6115>You are the best co-pilot I have ever seen in my life.</t6115>
<t6116>He gives me a slap on the cheek with his greasy hand.</t6116>
<t6117>—I did it to save myself, not you —he replies—.</t6117> <t6118>I haven't thought about you for even a second, believe me.</t6118>
<t6119>I laugh.</t6119>
<t6120>—Neither do I in you —he replied.</t6120>
<t6121>Ben looks at me, about to smile.</t6121>
<t6122>—Well, it was a huge damn cow.</t6122> <t6123>More than a cow, it was a land whale.</t6123>
<t6124>I laugh.</t6124>
<t6125>Radar comes out from under the car.</t6125>
<t6126>—Uncle, I really think it's perfect.</t6126> <t6127>We've only lost five minutes.</t6127> <t6128>We don't even have to increase the cruising speed.</t6128>
<t6129>Lacey observes the dented minivan, pursing her lips.</t6129>
<t6130>—What do you think? —I ask him.</t6130>
<t6131>—Let's go —he replies to me.</t6131>
<t6132>—Let's go —votes Radar.</t6132>
<t6133>Ben puffs out his cheeks and snorts.</t6133>
<t6134>—Above all because I like to push the group: let's go.</t6134>
<t6135>—Let's go —I say—.</t6135> <t6136>But I assure you that I won't drive again.</t6136>
<t6137>I hand Ben the keys and we get into the car.</t6137> <t6138>Radar guides us down a small embankment and we get back onto the highway.</t6138> <t6139>We are 872 kilometers from Agloe.</t6139>
<t6140>THIRTEEN O'CLOCK</t6140>
<t6141>Every two minutes, Radar says:</t6141>
<t6142>—Guys, do you remember that time when we were all going to die and then Ben grabbed the wheel, dodged a freaking giant cow, spun the car like the teacups at Disney World, and we were saved?</t6142>
<t6143>Lacey moves forward to the kitchen and places a hand on Ben's knee.</t6143>
<t6144>—You are a hero, do you realize that? —he says to him—.</t6144> <t6145>They give medals for things like this.</t6145>
<t6146>—I have said it before and I repeat it now: I have not thought about any of you.</t6146> <t6147>What I wanted was to save my own skin.</t6147>
<t6148>—Liar.</t6148> <t6149>Heroic and adorable liar —says Lacey.</t6149>
<t6150>And he gives her a kiss on the cheek.</t6150>
<t6151>—Hey, guys, do you remember that time when I was lying in the back, with both seat belts on, and the door suddenly opened, all the beers broke, but I survived completely unscathed? —says Radar—.</t6151> <t6152>How is that possible?</t6152>
<t6153>—Let's play metaphysical I spy —says Lacey—.</t6153> <t6154>I spy the heart of a hero, a heart that beats not for itself, but for all humanity.</t6154>
<t6155>—I'M NOT BEING HUMBLE.</t6155> <t6156>I SIMPLY DIDN'T WANT TO DIE —exclaims Ben.</t6156>
<t6157>—Guys, do you remember that time, in the car, twenty minutes ago, when for some reason we didn't die?</t6157>
<t6158>HOUR FOURTEEN</t6158>
<t6159>Once we got over the initial shock, we cleaned up.</t6159> <t6160>We tried to gather all the pieces of Bluefin bottle glass onto sheets of paper and put them in a plastic bag to throw away later.</t6160> <t6161>The minivan's carpets are sticky and soaked with Mountain Dew, Bluefin, and Diet Coke, and we tried to dry them with the few tissues we had.</t6161> <t6162>But the car would need a good cleaning, at the very least, and we don't have time before we get to Agloe.</t6162> <t6163>Radar has looked up what it will cost me to replace the side panel: 300 dollars plus the paint.</t6163> <t6164>This trip is getting more expensive, but I'll be able to pay back the money this summer, working at my dad's office, and anyway, it's not such a high price considering it's for Margo.</t6164>
<t6165>The sun begins to rise on our right.</t6165> <t6166>My cheek is still bleeding.</t6166> <t6167>Now the Confederate flag has stuck to the wound, so I no longer have to hold it.</t6167>
<t6168>FIFTEENTH HOUR</t6168>
<t6169>A group of oak trees hides the cornfields that stretch to the horizon.</t6169> <t6170>The landscape changes, but nothing else.</t6170> <t6171>Highways like this one turn the country into a single place: McDonald’s, BP, and Wendy’s.</t6171> <t6172>I know I probably should hate this aspect of highways and long for the happy days of the past, when you could soak up the local color of each place, but oh well.</t6172> <t6173>I like it.</t6173> <t6174>I like the regularity.</t6174> <t6175>I like driving fifteen hours straight from home without the world changing too much.</t6175> <t6176>Lacey fastens my seat belts.</t6176>
<t6177>—You need to rest —he tells me—.</t6177> <t6178>You've had a tough time.</t6178>
<t6179>I am surprised that no one has blamed me for not knowing how to react in the battle against the cow.</t6179>
<t6180>While I fall asleep, I hear them making each other laugh.</t6180> <t6181>I don't hear the exact words, just the cadence, the rises and falls of their conversation.</t6181> <t6182>I like to listen while lying on the grass.</t6182> <t6183>And I decide that if we arrive on time but don't find Margo, that's what we'll do.</t6183> <t6184>We'll find a spot in Catskill to spend some time, lie on the grass, chat, and joke around.</t6184> <t6185>Maybe knowing that she's alive makes it possible again, even though I have no proof that she is.</t6185> <t6186>I can almost imagine happiness without her, my ability to let her go, to feel that our roots are connected even if I never see that blade of grass again.</t6186>
<t6187>SIXTEEN HUNDRED HOURS</t6187>
<t6188>I sleep.</t6188>
<t6189>SEVENTEEN O'CLOCK</t6189>
<t6190>I sleep.</t6190>
<t6191>SIX O'CLOCK</t6191>
<t6192>I sleep.</t6192>
<t6193>HOUR NINETEEN</t6193>
<t6194>When I wake up, Radar and Ben are loudly arguing about the name of the car.</t6194> <t6195>Ben would like to call it Muhammad Ali, because, like Muhammad Ali, the minivan takes a punch and keeps going.</t6195> <t6196>Radar says you can't name a car after a historical figure.</t6196> <t6197>He thinks it should be called Lurlene, because it sounds nice.</t6197>
<t6198>—Do you want to call it Lurlene? —asks Ben, raising his voice, horrified—.</t6198> <t6199>Hasn't this poor vehicle already been through enough?</t6199>
<t6200>I unbuckle a belt and sit down.</t6200> <t6201>Lacey turns around.</t6201>
<t6202>—Good morning —he says to me—.</t6202> <t6203>Welcome to the great state of New York.</t6203>
<t6204>—What time is it?</t6204>
<t6205>—Nine forty-two.</t6205> <t6206>—She has tied her hair back in a ponytail, but the shorter strands are loose—.</t6206> <t6207>How are you?</t6207>
<t6208>—Scared —I answered.</t6208>
<t6209>Lacey smiles at me and nods.</t6209>
<t6210>—Yes, me too.</t6210> <t6211>It's as if too many things could happen to be prepared for all of them.</t6211>
<t6212>—Yes —I comment.</t6212>
<t6213>—I hope we continue being friends this summer —he tells me.</t6213>
<t6214>And for some reason, I feel better.</t6214> <t6215>You never know what will make you feel better.</t6215>
<t6216>Radar is saying that the car should be called Gray Goose.</t6216> <t6217>I move forward a bit so everyone can hear me.</t6217>
<t6218>—The Dreidel.</t6218> <t6219>The more you spin it, the better it works.</t6219>
<t6220>Ben nods.</t6220> <t6221>Radar turns around.</t6221>
<t6222>—I think you should be the official namer.</t6222>
<t6223>TWENTIETH HOUR</t6223>
<t6224>I am sitting in the first room with Lacey.</t6224> <t6225>Ben is driving.</t6225> <t6226>Radar is navigating.</t6226> <t6227>The last time they stopped, I was asleep, but they bought a map of New York.</t6227> <t6228>Agloe does not appear, but to the north of Roscoe, there are only five or six crossings.</t6228> <t6229>I had always thought that New York was an infinitely sprawling metropolis, but here you only see hills that the minivan heroically ascends.</t6229> <t6230>The conversation pauses for a moment, and Ben leans over to turn on the radio.</t6230>
<t6231>—I spy something metaphysical —I say.</t6231>
<t6232>Ben starts.</t6232>
<t6233>—I spy something that I like a lot.</t6233>
<t6234>—I know —says Radar—.</t6234> <t6235>The taste of balls.</t6235>
<t6236>No.</t6236>
<t6237>—The taste of the chicks? —I ask.</t6237>
<t6238>—No, dumbass —Ben replies to me.</t6238>
<t6239>—Hmm —says Radar—.</t6239> <t6240>The smell of the balls?</t6240>
<t6241>—The texture of the balls? —I ask.</t6241>
<t6242>—Come on, idiots, it has nothing to do with genitals.</t6242> <t6243>Lace?</t6243>
<t6244>—Hmm, the feeling of knowing that you have saved three lives?</t6244>
<t6245>—No, and I think you two have no more turns left to guess.</t6245>
<t6246>—Okay, what is it?</t6246>
<t6247>—Lacey —she replies.</t6247>
<t6248>I see him looking at her through the rearview mirror.</t6248>
<t6249>—Asshole —I tell him—, it's supposed to be a metaphysical I spy.</t6249> <t6250>They have to be things that can't be seen.</t6250>
<t6251>—And it is —he answers me—.</t6251> <t6252>And it is what I like the most... Lacey, but not the Lacey that is seen.</t6252>
<t6253>—I'm going to vomit —says Radar.</t6253>
<t6254>But Lacey unbuckles her seatbelt and leans over the kitchen to whisper something in Ben's ear.</t6254> <t6255>Ben turns red.</t6255>
<t6256>—Okay, I promise not to be cheesy —says Radar—.</t6256> <t6257>I spy with my little eye something that we are all feeling.</t6257>
<t6258>—A huge fatigue? —I ask.</t6258>
<t6259>—No, although an excellent response.</t6259>
<t6260>—That strange feeling that your heart isn't beating as fast as the rest of your body due to excess caffeine? —says Lacey.</t6260>
<t6261>—No. Ben?</t6261>
<t6262>—Hmm, do we feel like peeing, or is it just me?</t6262>
<t6263>—Just you, as always.</t6263> <t6264>Any more? —We stayed silent—.</t6264> <t6265>The correct answer is that we all felt we would be happier after an a cappella rendition of "Blister in the Sun."</t6265>
<t6266>And so it is.</t6266> <t6267>Although I have less ear for music than a deaf person, I sing as loudly as the others.</t6267> <t6268>And when we have finished, I say:</t6268>
<t6269>I see, I see a great story.</t6269>
<t6270>For a moment, no one says anything.</t6270> <t6271>Only the noise of the Dreidel devouring the asphalt and accelerating to climb the hill can be heard.</t6271>
<t6272>—This one, right? —says Ben after a while.</t6272>
<t6273>Seat.</t6273>
<t6274>—Yes —says Radar—.</t6274> <t6275>If we manage not to kill ourselves, it will be one hell of a story.</t6275>
<t6276>"It wouldn't be bad if we found her," I think, but I don't say it.</t6276> <t6277>In the end, Ben turns on the radio and looks for a rock ballad station so we can all sing together.</t6277>
<t6278>HOUR TWENTY-ONE</t6278>
<t6279>After more than 1800 kilometers on the highway, it's almost time to exit.</t6279> <t6280>It is completely impossible to drive at one hundred twenty-five kilometers per hour on the two-lane road that takes us further north, towards Catskill, but we will manage.</t6280> <t6281>Radar, always a brilliant strategist, had reserved an extra half hour without telling us anything.</t6281> <t6282>This is nice.</t6282> <t6283>The morning light illuminates the old trees.</t6283> <t6284>Even the brick buildings of the rundown towns we pass through seem new in this light.</t6284>
<t6285>Lacey and I tell Ben and Radar everything we can think of to help them find Margo.</t6285> <t6286>We remind them of details.</t6286> <t6287>We remind ourselves of them.</t6287> <t6288>Her silver Honda Civic.</t6288> <t6289>Her very straight brown hair.</t6289> <t6290>Her fascination with abandoned buildings.</t6290>
<t6291>—He carries a black notebook —I say.</t6291>
<t6292>Ben turns towards me.</t6292>
<t6293>—Okay, Q.</t6293> <t6294>If I see a girl exactly like Margo in Agloe, New York, I won't do anything unless she has a notebook.</t6294> <t6295>That will be the signal.</t6295>
<t6296>I don't pay attention to her.</t6296> <t6297>I just want to remember her.</t6297> <t6298>For the last time, I want to remember her while I still hope to see her again.</t6298>
<t6299>AGLOE</t6299>
<t6300>The speed limit drops from ninety to seventy, and then to sixty.</t6300> <t6301>We cross some train tracks and arrive in Roscoe.</t6301> <t6302>We move slowly through a sleepy town with a café, a clothing store, a dollar store, and a couple of storefronts boarded up.</t6302>
<t6303>—I can imagine her here —I say, leaning forward.</t6303>
<t6304>—Yes —admits Ben—.</t6304> <t6305>Dude, I really don't want to break into buildings.</t6305> <t6306>I don't think I'd do very well in New York's prisons.</t6306>
<t6307>Although the idea of exploring these buildings does not seem particularly alarming to me, as the whole town gives the impression of being deserted.</t6307> <t6308>There is nothing open.</t6308> <t6309>Past the center, the road crosses the highway, and on that road there is only the Roscoe neighborhood and an elementary school.</t6309> <t6310>The thick and tall trees make the modest wooden houses look tiny.</t6310>
<t6311>We enter another highway and increase our speed, although Radar continues to drive slowly.</t6311> <t6312>We have gone a little over a kilometer when we see an unpaved road to the left with no sign indicating its name.</t6312>
<t6313>—This could be it —I say.</t6313>
<t6314>—It's the way to a house —answers Ben.</t6314>
<t6315>But Radar turns anyway.</t6315> <t6316>The truth is that it looks like the path to a house, open in the packed earth.</t6316> <t6317>To our left, the grass grows, reaching the height of the tires.</t6317> <t6318>I don't see anything, although I fear it would be easy to hide anywhere in this field.</t6318> <t6319>We advance a stretch, and the road ends at a Victorian farmhouse.</t6319> <t6320>We turn around and return to the two-lane highway, further north.</t6320> <t6321>The highway turns towards Cat Hollow Road and we continue until we see an unpaved road identical to the previous one, this time to the right, leading to a sort of dilapidated gray wooden barn.</t6321> <t6322>In the fields, on both sides of us, there are huge cylindrical bales of hay, but the grass has started to grow.</t6322> <t6323>Radar doesn't exceed ten kilometers per hour.</t6323> <t6324>We are looking for something strange.</t6324> <t6325>Some flaw in this perfectly idyllic landscape.</t6325>
<t6326>—Do you think it could have been the Agloe Supermarket? —I ask.</t6326>
<t6327>—That barn?</t6327>
<t6328>—Yes.</t6328>
<t6329>—I don't know —Radar answers me—.</t6329> <t6330>Do supermarkets look like barns?</t6330>
<t6331>I let out a long sigh through my pursed lips.</t6331>
<t6332>—I don't know.</t6332>
<t6333>—It's that... shit, it's his car! —Lacey shouts next to me—.</t6333> <t6334>Yes yes yes yes yes his car his car!</t6334>
<t6335>Radar stops the minivan while I follow Lacey's finger, which points beyond the field, behind the building.</t6335> <t6336>A silver flash.</t6336> <t6337>I crouch down, place my face next to hers, and see the arc of the car's roof.</t6337> <t6338>God knows how it got there, because there is no path.</t6338>
<t6339>Radar stops, I jump out and run to the car.</t6339> <t6340>Empty.</t6340> <t6341>Open.</t6341> <t6342>I open the trunk.</t6342> <t6343>Also empty.</t6343> <t6344>There's only an open suitcase with nothing inside.</t6344> <t6345>I look around and head towards what I now believe are the remains of the Agloe Supermarket.</t6345> <t6346>Ben and Radar overtake me as I run through the mowed field.</t6346> <t6347>We enter the barn not through the door, but through one of the large holes that have formed where the wooden wall has fallen.</t6347>
<t6348>Inside the building, the sun enters through the many holes in the roof and illuminates parts of the rotten wooden floor.</t6348> <t6349>While I search for her, I mentally take note of everything I see: the wet floorboards.</t6349> <t6350>The smell of almonds, like her.</t6350> <t6351>An old clawfoot bathtub in a corner.</t6351> <t6352>It is so full of holes that the building is both interior and exterior at the same time.</t6352>
<t6353>I feel someone pulling hard on my shirt.</t6353> <t6354>I turn my head and see Ben, who shifts his eyes towards a corner of the room.</t6354> <t6355>I have to look through a large beam of light coming in from the ceiling, but I see that corner.</t6355> <t6356>Two plexiglass panels approximately one meter high, dirty and tinted gray, lean against each other forming an angle against the wooden wall.</t6356> <t6357>It's a triangular cubicle, if a cubicle can be triangular.</t6357>
<t6358>And what happens with tinted windows is that they let light through, so I see the unsettling scene, although in grayscale: Margo Roth Spiegelman is sitting in a black leather office chair, leaning over a school desk, writing.</t6358> <t6359>Her hair is much shorter —the uneven bangs above her eyebrows and all messy, as if to highlight the asymmetry—, but it's her.</t6359> <t6360>She is alive.</t6360> <t6361>She has moved her office from an abandoned mall in Florida to an abandoned barn in New York, and I have found her.</t6361>
<t6362>The four of us approach Margo, but she doesn't seem to see us.</t6362> <t6363>She keeps writing.</t6363> <t6364>Finally, someone—maybe Radar—says:</t6364>
<t6365>—Margo, Margo?</t6365>
<t6366>Margo stands on tiptoe, with her hands on the walls of the makeshift cubicle.</t6366> <t6367>If she is surprised to see us, her eyes do not show it.</t6367> <t6368>Here is Margo Roth Spiegelman, a meter and a half away from me, with chapped lips, no makeup, dirty nails, and mute eyes.</t6368> <t6369>I had never seen her eyes so dead until this point, but perhaps I had never seen her eyes before.</t6369> <t6370>She observes me.</t6370> <t6371>I am sure she is observing me, not Lacey, Ben, or Radar.</t6371> <t6372>I hadn't felt so observed since the lifeless eyes of Robert Joyner looked at me in Jefferson Park.</t6372>
<t6373>She remains silent for a long time, and her eyes scare me too much to approach her.</t6373> <t6374>"I and this mystery here we stand," wrote Whitman.</t6374>
<t6375>—Give me five minutes —he says finally.</t6375>
<t6376>He sits down again and continues writing.</t6376>
<t6377>I watch her write.</t6377> <t6378>She seems the same as always, except that she is a little dirty.</t6378> <t6379>I don't know why, but I always thought she would be different.</t6379> <t6380>Older.</t6380> <t6381>That I would barely recognize her when I finally saw her again.</t6381> <t6382>But here she is, I watch her through the plexiglass, and she looks like Margo Roth Spiegelman, the girl I've known since I was two years old, the girl who was an idea I loved.</t6382>
<t6383>And only now, when she closes the notebook, puts it in a backpack she has next to her, stands up, and approaches us, do I realize that this idea is not only wrong but also dangerous.</t6383> <t6384>How deceptive it is to believe that a person is anything more than just a person.</t6384>
<t6385>—Hello —he says to Lacey, smiling.</t6385>
<t6386>First, she hugs Lacey, then she shakes hands with Ben, and finally with Radar.</t6386> <t6387>She raises her eyebrows and says:</t6387>
<t6388>Hello, Q.</t6388>
<t6389>And she hugs me quickly and without squeezing.</t6389> <t6390>I want her to stay there.</t6390> <t6391>I want something to happen.</t6391> <t6392>I want to feel her sobbing against my chest, with tears sliding down her dirty cheeks onto my shirt.</t6392> <t6393>But she just hugs me quickly and sits on the floor.</t6393> <t6394>I sit in front of her.</t6394> <t6395>Ben, Radar, and Lacey also sit in a line with me, so the four of us are in front of Margo.</t6395>
<t6396>—I'm glad to see you —I say after a while, feeling like I'm breaking a silent prayer.</t6396>
<t6397>She moves her bangs to one side.</t6397> <t6398>She seems to be deciding exactly what to say before saying it.</t6398>
<t6399>—I… well… well… I rarely find myself at a loss for words, right?</t6399> <t6400>I haven't spoken much lately.</t6400> <t6401>I suppose we should start with: what the hell are you doing here?</t6401>
<t6402>—Margo —says Lacey—.</t6402> <t6403>For God's sake, we were so worried.</t6403>
<t6404>—You didn't have to worry —Margo replies cheerfully—.</t6404> <t6405>I'm fine.</t6405> <t6406>—She raises both thumbs—.</t6406> <t6407>I'm OK.</t6407>
<t6408>—You could have called us to tell us —says Ben with a certain tone of frustration—.</t6408> <t6409>We would have saved ourselves a trip that has been hell.</t6409>
<t6410>—In my experience, Bloody Ben, when you leave a place, it's best to leave.</t6410> <t6411>Why are you wearing a dress, by the way?</t6411>
<t6412>Ben blushes.</t6412>
<t6413>—Don't call him that —Lacey interjects.</t6413>
<t6414>Margo throws a glance at Lacey.</t6414>
<t6415>—Wow, did you hook up with him?</t6415> <t6416>—Lacey says nothing—.</t6416> <t6417>Don't tell me you hooked up with him —says Margo.</t6417>
<t6418>—I'm telling you —Lacey replies to her—.</t6418> <t6419>And I'm telling you that it's great.</t6419> <t6420>And I'm telling you that you're a bitch.</t6420> <t6421>And I'm telling you that I'm leaving.</t6421> <t6422>Nice to see you, Margo.</t6422> <t6423>Thanks for terrifying me and making me feel like shit during the whole last month of my senior year of high school, and for being a bitch when we searched everywhere to make sure you were okay.</t6423> <t6424>It was a pleasure meeting you.</t6424>
<t6425>—For me too.</t6425> <t6426>Without you, how would I have known how fat I was?</t6426>
<t6427>Lacey gets up and stomps out.</t6427> <t6428>Her steps vibrate on the rickety floor.</t6428> <t6429>Ben goes out after her.</t6429> <t6430>I glance over and see that Radar has also stood up.</t6430>
<t6431>—I didn't know you until I learned about you through your clues —says Radar—.</t6431> <t6432>I like your clues more than I like you.</t6432>
<t6433>—What the hell is he talking about? —Margo asks me.</t6433>
<t6434>Radar doesn't respond.</t6434> <t6435>He just leaves.</t6435>
<t6436>I should also leave, of course.</t6436> <t6437>They are more my friends than Margo, without a doubt.</t6437> <t6438>But I have questions to ask her.</t6438> <t6439>As she gets up and heads back to her cubicle, I start with the most obvious one:</t6439>
<t6440>—Why are you behaving like a spoiled child?</t6440>
<t6441>He turns around, grabs me by the shirt, and yells in my face:</t6441>
<t6442>—What the hell are you doing showing up here without warning?</t6442>
<t6443>—How on earth was I supposed to warn you if you disappeared off the face of the Earth?</t6443>
<t6444>I see that she blinks and I know she has no answer, so I continue.</t6444> <t6445>She has disappointed me.</t6445> <t6446>For… for… I don't know.</t6446> <t6447>For not being the Margo I expected.</t6447> <t6448>For not being the Margo I thought I had finally imagined correctly.</t6448>
<t6449>—I assumed you had a good reason for not getting in touch with anyone since that night.</t6449> <t6450>But… is this your reason?</t6450> <t6451>To be able to live like a vagabond?</t6451>
<t6452>He lets go of my shirt and moves away from me.</t6452>
<t6453>—And now who is being a spoiled child?</t6453> <t6454>I left in the only way one can leave.</t6454> <t6455>You rip your life off suddenly, like a band-aid.</t6455> <t6456>And then you are you, and Lace is Lace, and everyone is who they are, and I am me.</t6456>
<t6457>—But I couldn't be myself, Margo, because I thought you were dead.</t6457> <t6458>Almost all the time.</t6458> <t6459>So I had to do all kinds of shit I would never have done.</t6459>
<t6460>Now he yells at me and grabs me by the shirt to get face to face.</t6460>
<t6461>—Nonsense.</t6461> <t6462>You didn't come to make sure I was okay.</t6462> <t6463>You came because you wanted to save poor little Margo from her problematic nature so that she would be so grateful to her knight in shining armor that she would take off her clothes and beg you to make her yours.</t6463>
<t6464>—Nonsense! —I shout, and to a large extent, they are—.</t6464> <t6465>You were just playing with us, weren't you?</t6465> <t6466>You just wanted to make sure that even after you left to have fun elsewhere, everything still revolved around you.</t6466>
<t6467>And she yells at me too, louder than I would have thought possible.</t6467>
<t6468>—I haven't even disappointed you, Q!</t6468> <t6469>It's the idea of me that you got into your head since we were kids that has disappointed you!</t6469>
<t6470>She tries to turn around, but I grab her by the shoulders and hold her in front of me.</t6470>
<t6471>—Have you ever thought about what it meant to leave?</t6471> <t6472>Have you thought about Ruthie?</t6472> <t6473>About me, Lacey, or any of the people who cared about you?</t6473> <t6474>No.</t6474> <t6475>Of course not.</t6475> <t6476>Because if it doesn't happen to you, it doesn't happen to anyone.</t6476> <t6477>Right, Margo? Right?</t6477>
<t6478>He no longer confronts me.</t6478> <t6479>He lets go, turns around, and goes back to his office.</t6479> <t6480>He kicks the plexiglass walls, which resonate against the desk and chair before falling to the floor.</t6480>
<t6481>—SHUT UP SHUT UP IDIOT.</t6481>
<t6482>—Very well —I answered him.</t6482>
<t6483>The fact that Margo completely loses her composure makes me regain mine.</t6483> <t6484>I try to speak like my mother.</t6484>
<t6485>—I remain silent.</t6485> <t6486>We are both angry.</t6486> <t6487>As for me... there are many unresolved issues.</t6487>
<t6488>He sits in the chair, with his feet resting on what had been the wall of his office.</t6488> <t6489>He looks towards a corner of the barn.</t6489> <t6490>At least three meters separate us.</t6490>
<t6491>—How the hell did you find me?</t6491>
<t6492>—I thought you wanted us to find you —I answered.</t6492>
<t6493>I speak in such a low voice that I'm surprised she hears me, but she turns the chair to look at me.</t6493>
<t6494>—I can swear to you that no.</t6494>
<t6495>—The "Song of Myself" —I tell her—.</t6495> <t6496>Guthrie led me to Whitman.</t6496> <t6497>Whitman led me to the door.</t6497> <t6498>The door led me to the abandoned mall.</t6498> <t6499>We discovered how to read the hidden graffiti.</t6499> <t6500>I didn't understand the "paper towns" thing, because it also means subdivisions that were never built, so I thought you had gone to one of those subdivisions and that you would never come back.</t6500> <t6501>I thought you were dead in one of those places, that you had killed yourself and for some reason wanted me to find you.</t6501> <t6502>So I went to a bunch of subdivisions to look for you.</t6502> <t6503>But then I matched the souvenir shop map with the pinholes.</t6503> <t6504>I started reading the poem more carefully and thought that you probably weren't going from place to place, that you had locked yourself up to plan.</t6504> <t6505>To write in that notebook.</t6505> <t6506>I found Agloe on the map, saw your comment on the Omnictionary page, skipped graduation, and drove here.</t6506>
<t6507>He runs a hand through his hair, but it's no longer long enough to fall into his face.</t6507>
<t6508>—I hate this haircut —he tells me—.</t6508> <t6509>I wanted to change my look, but… it's ridiculous.</t6509>
<t6510>—I like it —I tell her—.</t6510> <t6511>It frames your face very well.</t6511>
<t6512>—I'm sorry for being such a bitch —she tells me—.</t6512> <t6513>You have to understand…</t6513> <t6514>Well, you guys show up out of nowhere and scare the hell out of me…</t6514>
<t6515>—You could have just said: "Guys, you're freaking me out" —I tell him.</t6515>
<t6516>He mocks.</t6516>
<t6517>—Yes, of course, because that is the Margo Roth Spiegelman that everyone knows and everyone loves.</t6517> <t6518>—She stays silent for a moment and then says—: I knew I shouldn't have written that in the Omnictionary.</t6518> <t6519>I just thought it would be fun for them to find it later.</t6519> <t6520>I thought the police would find me, but not in time.</t6520> <t6521>The Omnictionary has a billion pages.</t6521> <t6522>I never thought…</t6522>
<t6523>—What?</t6523>
<t6524>—I have thought about you a lot, if that answers your question.</t6524> <t6525>And about Ruthie.</t6525> <t6526>And about my parents.</t6526> <t6527>Of course, okay?</t6527> <t6528>Maybe I am the most tremendously egocentric person in the history of the world.</t6528> <t6529>But do you think I would have done it if I didn't need to?</t6529> <t6530>—He shakes his head.</t6530> <t6531>He finally leans towards me, with his elbows on his knees, and we talk.</t6531> <t6532>At a certain distance, but it doesn't matter—.</t6532> <t6533>I couldn't think of any other way to leave without being dragged back.</t6533>
<t6534>—I'm glad you're not dead —I tell her.</t6534>
<t6535>—Yes, me too —he replies to me.</t6535> <t6536>He smiles, and it is the first time I see that smile that I have missed so much—.</t6536> <t6537>That's why I had to leave.</t6537> <t6538>No matter how fucked up life is, it's always better than death.</t6538>
<t6539>My phone rings.</t6539> <t6540>It's Ben. I answer.</t6540>
<t6541>—Lacey wants to talk to Margo —he tells me.</t6541>
<t6542>I approach Margo, hand her the phone, and stay there while she listens with hunched shoulders.</t6542> <t6543>I hear the noises coming from the phone, and then I hear Margo interrupting Lacey.</t6543>
<t6544>—Hey —she says to him—, I'm really sorry.</t6544> <t6545>I was just very scared.</t6545>
<t6546>And silence.</t6546> <t6547>Lacey starts talking again, and in the end, Margo laughs and says something.</t6547> <t6548>I feel they should have some privacy, so I'm going to take a look.</t6548> <t6549>Against the office wall, but in the opposite corner of the barn, Margo has set up some kind of bed: four pallets with an inflatable mattress on top.</t6549> <t6550>Her small collection of clothes, perfectly folded, is on another pallet, next to the bed.</t6550> <t6551>There is a toothbrush and toothpaste, as well as a large plastic cup.</t6551> <t6552>These things are on top of two books: The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath, and Slaughterhouse-Five by Kurt Vonnegut.</t6552> <t6553>I find it hard to believe she has been living like this, with this irreconcilable mix of neat residential area and eerie decay.</t6553> <t6554>And I also find it hard to believe the time I wasted thinking she was living any other way.</t6554>
<t6555>—They are at a motel in the park.</t6555> <t6556>Lace told me that they are leaving tomorrow morning, with or without you —Margo says to me from behind.</t6556>
<t6557>When you say "you" instead of "we," I think for the first time about what is going to come next.</t6557>
<t6558>—I am almost self-sufficient —he tells me, now by my side—.</t6558> <t6559>There is a latrine, but it's in quite bad condition, so I usually go to the bathroom at the truck stop east of Roscoe.</t6559> <t6560>There are also showers, and the women's ones are quite clean, because there aren't many female truckers.</t6560> <t6561>And they have internet.</t6561> <t6562>It's as if this were my home, and the truck stop were my little beach house.</t6562>
<t6563>I laugh.</t6563>
<t6564>He moves forward, kneels down, and looks under the bed pallets.</t6564> <t6565>He takes out a flashlight and a square piece of plastic.</t6565>
<t6566>—It's the only thing I've bought all month, apart from gas and food.</t6566> <t6567>I've only spent about three hundred dollars.</t6567>
<t6568>I pick up the square and finally see that it is a battery-powered turntable.</t6568>
<t6569>—I brought a couple of records —he tells me—.</t6569> <t6570>But I'll get more in the city.</t6570>
<t6571>—The city?</t6571>
<t6572>—Yes, today I'm going to New York.</t6572> <t6573>That's why the Omnictionary thing.</t6573> <t6574>I'm going to start traveling seriously.</t6574> <t6575>Initially, today was the day I planned to leave Orlando.</t6575> <t6576>I was going to go to graduation, do all the sophisticated graduation night pranks with you, and leave the next morning.</t6576> <t6577>But I couldn't take it anymore.</t6577> <t6578>I really couldn't take it for even one more hour.</t6578> <t6579>And when I found out about Jase...</t6579> <t6580>I thought: "I have everything planned.</t6580> <t6581>I just change the date."</t6581> <t6582>But I'm sorry for scaring you.</t6582> <t6583>I tried not to scare you, but the last part was very rushed.</t6583> <t6584>It wasn't my best work.</t6584>
<t6585>As far as hastily made escape plans full of clues go, they seemed quite impressive to me.</t6585> <t6586>But above all, I was surprised that he had included me in his plans from the very beginning.</t6586>
<t6587>—You'll bring me up to speed —I said, trying to smile—.</t6587> <t6588>Well, I wonder about many things.</t6588> <t6589>What you had planned and what you hadn't.</t6589> <t6590>What each thing meant.</t6590> <t6591>Why the clues were directed at me.</t6591> <t6592>Why you left…</t6592> <t6593>Those kinds of things.</t6593>
<t6594>—Hmm, okay, okay.</t6594> <t6595>To tell you that story, we have to start with another one.</t6595>
<t6596>He gets up and I follow his steps, which skillfully avoid the rotten floorboards.</t6596> <t6597>He returns to his office, puts his hand in the backpack, and takes out the black notebook.</t6597> <t6598>He sits on the floor, crosses his legs, and pats the piece of floor next to him.</t6598> <t6599>I sit down.</t6599> <t6600>He rests his hand on the closed notebook.</t6600>
<t6601>—This goes back a long time —he tells me—.</t6601> <t6602>When I was in fourth grade, I started writing a story in this notebook.</t6602> <t6603>It was a kind of detective story.</t6603>
<t6604>I think that if I took her notebook, I could blackmail her.</t6604> <t6605>I could use it to make her return to Orlando, she could find a summer job and live in an apartment until college started, and at least we would have the summer.</t6605> <t6606>But I just listen to her.</t6606>
<t6607>—Well, I don't like to brag, but it's a brilliant literary work like few others.</t6607> <t6608>Just kidding.</t6608> <t6609>They are the stupid ramblings full of desires and magic from when I was ten years old.</t6609> <t6610>The protagonist is a girl named Margo Spiegelman, who was like me at ten years old, except that her parents are kind and rich and buy her everything she wants.</t6610> <t6611>Margo likes a boy named Quentin, who is like you in every way, except that he is brave, heroic, would be willing to die to protect me, and all that.</t6611> <t6612>There is also Myrna Mountweazel, who is just like Myrna Mountweazel, but has magical powers.</t6612> <t6613>For example, in the story, anyone who pets Myrna Mountweazel cannot lie for ten minutes.</t6613> <t6614>And Myrna talks.</t6614> <t6615>Of course she talks.</t6615> <t6616>Has a ten-year-old ever written a book about a dog that couldn't talk?</t6616>
<t6617>I laugh, though I keep thinking about the ten-year-old Margo who likes the ten-year-old Quentin.</t6617>
<t6618>—Well, in the story —Margo continues— Quentin, Margo, and Myrna Mountweazel are investigating the death of Robert Joyner, and his death is exactly the same as that real death, but instead of having shot himself in the face, someone shot him.</t6618> <t6619>And the story is about us finding out who killed him.</t6619>
<t6620>—Who killed him?</t6620>
<t6621>He/She laughs.</t6621>
<t6622>—Do you want me to tell you the ending?</t6622>
<t6623>—Well —I replied—, I'd better read it.</t6623>
<t6624>She opens the notebook and shows me a page.</t6624> <t6625>The text is indecipherable, not because Margo has bad handwriting, but because there are vertical lines over the horizontal ones.</t6625>
<t6626>—I write in code —he tells me—.</t6626> <t6627>It's very difficult for anyone other than me to decipher it.</t6627> <t6628>Alright, fine, I'll tell you the ending, but first you have to promise me that you won't get mad.</t6628>
<t6629>—I promise you —I answer him.</t6629>
<t6630>—It turns out that the crime was committed by the alcoholic brother of the sister of Robert Joyner's ex-wife, who was crazy because he had been possessed by the spirit of an evil cat from ancient Egypt.</t6630> <t6631>As I said, a top-notch story.</t6631> <t6632>But, well, in the story, you, I, and Myrna Mountweazel confront the killer, who tries to shoot me, but you jump, place yourself in front, and die heroically in my arms.</t6632>
<t6633>I laugh.</t6633>
<t6634>—Great.</t6634> <t6635>The story was so promising, with the pretty girl who liked me, the mystery and intrigue, and it turns out she died.</t6635>
<t6636>—Well, yes —she tells me, smiling—.</t6636> <t6637>But I had to kill you, because the only other possible ending was to end up in bed, and the truth is, I wasn't emotionally prepared to write those things at ten years old.</t6637>
<t6638>—I understand —I tell him—.</t6638> <t6639>But when you review it, I want a bit of action.</t6639>
<t6640>—Maybe after the bad guy has shot you.</t6640> <t6641>A kiss before dying.</t6641>
<t6642>—Very kind.</t6642>
<t6643>I could get up, approach her, and kiss her.</t6643> <t6644>I could.</t6644> <t6645>But I can still mess up too many things.</t6645>
<t6646>—In the end, I finished the story in fifth grade.</t6646> <t6647>A few years later, I decide that I'm going to Mississippi.</t6647> <t6648>And then I write all my plans for the epic event in this notebook, on top of the previous story, and in the end, I leave.</t6648> <t6649>I take my mother's car, drive almost two thousand kilometers, and leave clues in the soup.</t6649> <t6650>I didn't even like the trip, to be honest.</t6650> <t6651>I felt very lonely.</t6651> <t6652>But I love having done it, you know?</t6652> <t6653>Then I start layering more stories, jokes, and ideas to pair certain girls with certain boys, huge house wallpapering campaigns, more road trips, and many other things.</t6653> <t6654>The notebook is half full when we start the last year, and that's when I decide that I'm going to do one more thing, something big, and then I'll leave.</t6654>
<t6655>She's going to keep talking, but I have to stop her.</t6655>
<t6656>—I wonder if it was because of the place or the people.</t6656> <t6657>What would have happened if the people around you had been different?</t6657>
<t6658>—How can you separate one thing from the other?</t6658> <t6659>The people are the place, and the place is the people.</t6659> <t6660>And well, I didn't think there was anyone else I could be friends with.</t6660> <t6661>I thought everyone was either scared, like you, or didn't care, like Lacey.</t6661> <t6662>And...</t6662>
<t6663>—I'm not as scared as you think —I tell him.</t6663>
<t6664>And it's true.</t6664> <t6665>I only realize that it's true when I've already said it.</t6665> <t6666>But even so.</t6666>
<t6667>—I'm getting to that part —he says almost complaining—.</t6667> <t6668>When I'm in first year, Gus takes me to the Osprey…</t6668> <t6669>—I shake my head, confused—.</t6669> <t6670>The abandoned mall.</t6670> <t6671>And I start going there on my own every now and then, just to hang out and write my plans.</t6671> <t6672>And towards the last year, all the plans started to revolve around the final escape.</t6672> <t6673>And I don't know if it's because I read my old story when I went, but I quickly included you in my plans.</t6673> <t6674>The idea was that we were going to do all those things together —like breaking into SeaWorld, which was in the original plan— and I would pressure you to be a jerk.</t6674> <t6675>That night I would set you free.</t6675> <t6676>And then I would disappear and you would always remember me.</t6676>
<t6677>"In the end, the plan takes up about seventy pages, and it's about to be fulfilled, everything has gone very well, but I discover about Jase and decide to leave.</t6677> <t6678>Immediately.</t6678> <t6679>I don't need to graduate.</t6679> <t6680>What's the point of graduating?</t6680> <t6681>But first I have to tie up the loose ends.</t6681> <t6682>So all that day, at school, I carry the notebook with me, frantically trying to adapt the plan to Becca, Jase, Lacey, and everyone who wasn't as much of a friend as I thought, trying to come up with ideas so that everyone would know how much they had disappointed me before I left them forever.</t6682>
<t6683>»But I still wanted to do it with you.</t6683> <t6684>I still liked the idea of maybe turning you into something like the badass hero of my childhood story.</t6684>
<t6685>"And then you surprise me," she says to me.</t6685> <t6686>For me, you had been a paper boy all these years...</t6686> <t6687>Two dimensions as a character on paper and two other different dimensions, but also flat, as a person.</t6687> <t6688>But that night it turned out you were real.</t6688> <t6689>And it ends up being so strange, fun, and magical that I go back to my room in the morning and I miss you.</t6689> <t6690>I want to come find you, go out and chat, but I've already decided to leave, so I have to leave.</t6690> <t6691>And then, at the last second, it occurs to me to send you the Osprey.</t6691> <t6692>To leave it with you to help you keep moving forward on the path of not being a scared kitten.</t6692>
<t6693>»And yes, that's all.</t6693> <t6694>I think of something quickly.</t6694> <t6695>I stick the Woody poster on the outside of the blind, circle the song on the record, and mark the two verses from "Song of Myself" in a different color than the one I used when I read it.</t6695> <t6696>Then, when you've already gone to school, I sneak in through your window and put the piece of newspaper in the door.</t6696> <t6697>That same morning I go to the Osprey, partly because I still don't feel ready to leave, and partly because I want to leave it clean for you.</t6697> <t6698>Anyway, the point is that I didn't want you to worry.</t6698> <t6699>That's why I covered the graffiti.</t6699> <t6700>I didn't know you would manage to see it.</t6700> <t6701>I tore out the pages of the calendar I had used and also removed the map, which I had hung up since I saw it included Agloe.</t6701> <t6702>And then, since I'm tired and have nowhere to go, I sleep there.</t6702> <t6703>In fact, in the end, I spend two nights there, trying to gather the courage, I suppose.</t6703> <t6704>And also, I don't know, I thought maybe you would find it right away.</t6704> <t6705>And then I left.</t6705> <t6706>It took me two days to get here.</t6706> <t6707>And I've been here ever since.</t6707>
<t6708>It seems to be over, but I have another question left.</t6708>
<t6709>—And why precisely here?</t6709>
<t6710>—A paper town for a paper girl —she answers me—.</t6710> <t6711>I read about Agloe in a book of "surprising things" when I was ten or eleven years old.</t6711> <t6712>And I never got it out of my head.</t6712> <t6713>The truth is that every time I went up to the SunTrust Building (including the last time I went with you), what I thought when looking down wasn't that everything was made of paper.</t6713> <t6714>I looked down and thought that I was made of paper.</t6714> <t6715>I was the weak and foldable person, not the others.</t6715> <t6716>And that's the point.</t6716> <t6717>People love the idea of a paper girl.</t6717> <t6718>They've always loved it.</t6718> <t6719>And the worst part is that I loved it too.</t6719> <t6720>I cultivated it, you know?</t6720>
<t6721>"Because it's great to be an idea that everyone likes."</t6721> <t6722>"But I couldn't be the idea of myself, not entirely."</t6722> <t6723>"And Agloe is a place where a paper creation becomes real."</t6723> <t6724>"A point on the map turned into a real place, more real than the people who created that point would have imagined."</t6724> <t6725>"I thought that maybe here the paper silhouette of a girl could start to become real."</t6725> <t6726>"And it seemed to me a way to tell that girl who worried about popularity, clothes, and everything else: 'You will go to the paper towns.</t6726> <t6727>And you will never come back.'"</t6727>
<t6728>—The spray-painted one —I told her—.</t6728> <t6729>For God's sake, Margo, I've searched through many abandoned subdivisions looking for your body.</t6729> <t6730>I really thought…</t6730> <t6731>I really thought you were dead.</t6731>
<t6732>He gets up, rummages in his backpack for a moment, takes out The Bell Jar, and reads to me.</t6732>
<t6733>—"But when the moment came to do it, the skin on my wrist seemed so white and defenseless that I couldn't.</t6733> <t6734>It was as if what I wanted to kill wasn't in that skin, nor in the faint blue pulse that throbbed under my thumb, but somewhere deeper, more secret, and much harder to reach."</t6734>
<t6735>Sit back down next to me, very close, facing me.</t6735> <t6736>The fabric of our jeans touches without our knees actually brushing against each other.</t6736>
<t6737>—I know what you're talking about —says Margo—.</t6737> <t6738>That deeper and more secret something.</t6738> <t6739>They are like cracks inside you.</t6739> <t6740>Like faulty lines where things don't fit well.</t6740>
<t6741>—I like it —I tell him—.</t6741> <t6742>Or like cracks in the hull of a ship.</t6742>
<t6743>—Yes, yes.</t6743>
<t6744>—In the end, you sink.</t6744>
<t6745>—Exactly —he tells me.</t6745>
<t6746>Now we are having a conversation.</t6746>
<t6747>—I can't believe you didn't want me to find you.</t6747>
<t6748>—Sorry.</t6748> <t6749>If it will make you feel better, I'm impressed.</t6749> <t6750>Besides, it's nice to have you here.</t6750> <t6751>You are a good travel companion.</t6751>
<t6752>—Is that a proposal? —I ask him.</t6752>
<t6753>—It could be —he replies to me, smiling.</t6753>
<t6754>My heart has been spinning in my chest for so long that this kind of dizziness seems almost bearable, but only almost.</t6754>
<t6755>—Margo, if you come back home for the summer… my parents have said that you can live with us, or you can look for a job and an apartment for the summer, and then classes will start and you won't have to live with your parents again.</t6755>
<t6756>—It's not just because of them.</t6756> <t6757>I would get trapped again and never get out of there.</t6757> <t6758>It's not just the gossip, the parties, and all that crap, but the prospect of living life the way it should be lived: university, job, husband, kids, and all that bullshit.</t6758>
<t6759>The problem is that I do believe in the university, in work, and maybe in having children someday.</t6759> <t6760>I believe in the future.</t6760> <t6761>Maybe it's a flaw in my character, but in my case, it's congenital.</t6761>
<t6762>—But the university broadens your opportunities —I finally tell him—.</t6762> <t6763>It doesn't limit them.</t6763>
<t6764>Smiles with smugness.</t6764>
<t6765>—Thank you, university advisor Jacobsen —he says to me, and changes the subject—.</t6765> <t6766>I thought about you a lot while inside the Osprey.</t6766> <t6767>About whether you would get used to it.</t6767> <t6768>About whether you would stop worrying about the rats.</t6768>
<t6769>—That's how it was —I answered—.</t6769> <t6770>I started to like it.</t6770> <t6771>The truth is that I spent the night of the dance there.</t6771>
<t6772>Smile.</t6772>
<t6773>—Incredible.</t6773> <t6774>I imagined that in the end you would like it.</t6774> <t6775>I was never bored on the Osprey, but it was because at some point I had to go back home.</t6775> <t6776>When I got here, I was indeed bored.</t6776> <t6777>There is nothing to do.</t6777> <t6778>I have read a lot since I arrived.</t6778> <t6779>Not knowing anyone made me more and more nervous.</t6779> <t6780>And I hoped that this loneliness and nervousness would make me go back.</t6780> <t6781>But it hasn't been like that.</t6781> <t6782>It's the only thing I can't do, Q.</t6782>
<t6783>Seat.</t6783> <t6784>I understand it.</t6784> <t6785>I imagine it's hard to go back when the palms of your hands encompass continents.</t6785> <t6786>But I try once more.</t6786>
<t6787>—And what will happen after the summer?</t6787> <t6788>What will happen with the university?</t6788> <t6789>What will happen with the rest of your life?</t6789>
<t6790>He shrugs.</t6790>
<t6791>—What will happen?</t6791>
<t6792>—Aren't you worried about the future?</t6792>
<t6793>"The future is made up of nows," he replies to me.</t6793>
<t6794>I have nothing to say.</t6794> <t6795>I'm mulling it over when Margo says:</t6795>
<t6796>—Emily Dickinson.</t6796> <t6797>As I told you, I am reading a lot.</t6797>
<t6798>I believe that the future deserves that we believe in it.</t6798> <t6799>But it is difficult to contradict Emily Dickinson.</t6799> <t6800>Margo stands up, slings the backpack over one shoulder, and extends her hand to me.</t6800>
<t6801>—Let's go for a walk.</t6801>
<t6802>As we leave, Margo asks me for the phone.</t6802> <t6803>She types in a number and when I start to move away to let her talk, she grabs my arm to keep me with her.</t6803> <t6804>I walk beside her towards the field while she talks to her parents.</t6804>
<t6805>—Hello, it's Margo…</t6805> <t6806>I'm in Agloe, New York, with Quentin… Wow… Well, no, mom, I'm just thinking about how to answer you honestly…</t6806> <t6807>Mom, come on…</t6807> <t6808>I don't know, mom…</t6808> <t6809>I decided to move to a fictional place.</t6809> <t6810>That's what happened…</t6810> <t6811>Yes, well, anyway, I don't think I'll go there… Can I talk to Ruthie?…</t6811> <t6812>Hello, sweetie…</t6812> <t6813>Yes, well, I loved you first…</t6813> <t6814>Yes, I'm sorry.</t6814> <t6815>It was a mistake.</t6815> <t6816>I thought…</t6816> <t6817>I don't know what I thought, Ruthie, but it was a mistake and from now on I'll call you.</t6817> <t6818>Maybe I won't call mom, but I'll call you…</t6818> <t6819>Wednesdays?…</t6819> <t6820>You can't on Wednesdays.</t6820> <t6821>Hmm. Okay.</t6821> <t6822>What day works for you?…</t6822> <t6823>Tuesdays…</t6823> <t6824>Yes, every Tuesday…</t6824> <t6825>Yes, including this Tuesday.</t6825> <t6826>—Margo closes her eyes and grits her teeth—.</t6826> <t6827>Alright, Ruthers, can you put mom on?…</t6827> <t6828>I love you, mom.</t6828> <t6829>Everything will be fine.</t6829> <t6830>I promise you…</t6830> <t6831>Yes, okay, you too.</t6831> <t6832>Goodbye.</t6832>
<t6833>He stops and hangs up the phone, but holds onto it for a minute.</t6833> <t6834>He squeezes it so hard that the tips of his fingers start to turn red.</t6834> <t6835>Then he lets it fall to the ground.</t6835> <t6836>His scream is brief but deafening, and as it echoes, I become aware for the first time of the miserable silence of Agloe.</t6836>
<t6837>—It is believed that what I have to do is please her, that I shouldn't desire anything else, and when I don't please her... she throws me out.</t6837> <t6838>She has changed the locks.</t6838> <t6839>It's the first thing she told me.</t6839> <t6840>For God's sake.</t6840>
<t6841>—I'm sorry —I say, pushing aside the yellowish grass that reaches our knees to pick up the phone—.</t6841> <t6842>But everything okay with Ruthie?</t6842>
<t6843>—Yes, she is very nice.</t6843> <t6844>I hate myself for... you know... not having talked to her.</t6844>
<t6845>—Yes —I tell him.</t6845>
<t6846>He gives me a playful shove.</t6846>
<t6847>—You are supposed to make me feel better, not worse! —he tells me—.</t6847> <t6848>It's your role!</t6848>
<t6849>—I didn't know that what I had to do was to please you, Miss Spiegelman.</t6849>
<t6850>He/She laughs.</t6850>
<t6851>—Oh, you compare me to my mother.</t6851> <t6852>What an insult.</t6852> <t6853>But I deserve it.</t6853> <t6854>Well, how have you been?</t6854> <t6855>If Ben is dating Lacey, surely you are having orgies every night with a bunch of cheerleaders.</t6855>
<t6856>We walked slowly through the uneven field.</t6856> <t6857>It doesn't seem big, but as we move forward, I realize that there is no way we can get closer to the trees in the background.</t6857> <t6858>I tell him that I skipped graduation and about the miraculous spin of the Dreidel.</t6858> <t6859>I tell him about the dance, Lacey's fight with Becca, and my night at the Osprey.</t6859>
<t6860>—It was the night I knew there was no doubt you had been there —I tell her—.</t6860> <t6861>The blanket still smelled like you.</t6861>
<t6862>And when I tell her, her hand brushes against mine, and I take it because it feels like there's not much left to ruin now.</t6862> <t6863>She looks at me.</t6863>
<t6864>—I had to leave.</t6864> <t6865>I shouldn't have scared you, it was stupid, I should have left in another way, but I had to go.</t6865> <t6866>Do you understand now?</t6866>
<t6867>—Yes —I tell him—, but I think you can come back now.</t6867> <t6868>I really believe it.</t6868>
<t6869>—No, you don't believe it —he replies to me.</t6869>
<t6870>And he is right.</t6870> <t6871>He sees it in my face.</t6871> <t6872>At last, I understand that I cannot be her, and that she cannot be me.</t6872> <t6873>Maybe Whitman had a gift that I do not have.</t6873> <t6874>As far as I am concerned, I have to ask the wounded where the wound is, because I cannot become the wounded.</t6874> <t6875>The only wounded person I can be is myself.</t6875>
<t6876>I trample the grass and sit down.</t6876> <t6877>Margo lies down next to me, using the backpack as a pillow.</t6877> <t6878>I lie down on my back as well.</t6878> <t6879>She takes a couple of books out of the backpack and hands them to me to use as a pillow.</t6879> <t6880>An anthology of poems by Emily Dickinson and Leaves of Grass.</t6880>
<t6881>—I had two copies —he tells me, smiling.</t6881>
<t6882>—It's excellent —I tell him—.</t6882> <t6883>You couldn't have chosen better.</t6883>
<t6884>—It was an impulsive decision that morning, truly.</t6884> <t6885>I remembered the passage about the doors and thought it was perfect.</t6885> <t6886>But then, upon arriving here, I read it again.</t6886> <t6887>I hadn't read it since my sophomore year of high school and, yes, I liked it.</t6887> <t6888>I've tried to read a lot of poetry.</t6888> <t6889>I was trying to figure out… what it was that surprised me about you that night.</t6889> <t6890>And for a long time, I thought it was when you quoted T. S. Eliot.</t6890>
<t6891>—But that wasn't it —I tell her—.</t6891> <t6892>You were surprised by my biceps and my elegant exit through the window.</t6892>
<t6893>Smile.</t6893>
<t6894>—Shut up and let me compliment you, dumbass.</t6894> <t6895>It wasn't the poetry or your biceps.</t6895> <t6896>What surprised me was that, despite your anxiety attacks and all that, you really were like the Quentin from my story.</t6896> <t6897>Well, I had been writing over that story for years, and every time I wrote, I also read that page, and I always laughed and told myself…</t6897> <t6898>No offense, but I told myself: "Damn, I can't believe I thought Quentin Jacobsen was a super good-looking, super loyal defender of justice."</t6898> <t6899>But… well… you were.</t6899>
<t6900>I could turn around, and she could also turn around.</t6900> <t6901>And we could kiss.</t6901> <t6902>But what sense does it make to kiss her now?</t6902> <t6903>It's something that won't go anywhere.</t6903> <t6904>We both gaze at the cloudless sky.</t6904>
<t6905>—Things never happen the way you imagine —he tells me.</t6905>
<t6906>The sky is like a contemporary monochromatic painting, its illusion of depth attracts and elevates me.</t6906>
<t6907>—Yes, it's true —I tell him.</t6907> <t6908>But I think for a second and add—:</t6908> <t6909>But it's also true that if you don't imagine, nothing ever happens.</t6909>
<t6910>Imagining is not perfect.</t6910> <t6911>You can't get inside another person.</t6911> <t6912>I could never have imagined Margo's rage when we found her, nor the story she was writing.</t6912> <t6913>But imagining that you are someone else, or that the world is something else, is the only way to enter.</t6913> <t6914>It is the machine that kills fascists.</t6914>
<t6915>She turns towards me, rests her head on my shoulder, and we lie down, just as I imagined us in the grass at SeaWorld.</t6915> <t6916>We have traveled thousands of kilometers and many days, but here we are: her head on my shoulder, her breath on my neck, and the immense fatigue of both of us.</t6916> <t6917>We are now as I would have wished to be then.</t6917>
<t6918>When I wake up, the dim daylight makes everything seem important, from the yellowish sky to the blades of grass above my head, swaying in slow motion like a beauty queen.</t6918> <t6919>I turn to the side and see Margo Roth Spiegelman kneeling with her hands on the ground a few meters from me, her jeans hugging her legs.</t6919> <t6920>It takes me a moment to realize that she is digging.</t6920> <t6921>I crawl over to her and start digging beside her.</t6921> <t6922>The earth beneath the grass is dry as dust between my fingers.</t6922> <t6923>She smiles at me.</t6923> <t6924>My heart beats at the speed of sound.</t6924>
<t6925>—What are we digging? —I ask him.</t6925>
<t6926>—That is not the right question —he tells me—.</t6926> <t6927>The question is: For whom are we digging?</t6927>
<t6928>—Alright.</t6928> <t6929>Who are we digging for?</t6929>
<t6930>—We are digging graves for little Margo, little Quentin, the puppy Myrna Mountweazel, and poor dead Robert Joyner —he answers me.</t6930>
<t6931>—I think I support those burials —I tell him.</t6931>
<t6932>The earth is lumpy and dry, perforated by the passage of insects like an abandoned anthill.</t6932> <t6933>We sink our hands into the ground again and again, and each handful of soil drags a small cloud of dust.</t6933> <t6934>We open a large and deep hole.</t6934> <t6935>The grave must be appropriate.</t6935> <t6936>It doesn't take long to reach my elbows.</t6936> <t6937>My shirt sleeve gets dirty when I wipe the sweat from my cheek.</t6937> <t6938>Margo's cheeks are getting redder and redder.</t6938> <t6939>Her scent reaches me, and it smells like that night before we jumped into the pit at SeaWorld.</t6939>
<t6940>—I have never thought of him as a real person —she tells me.</t6940>
<t6941>While he speaks, I take the opportunity to pause and squat down.</t6941>
<t6942>—In whom, in Robert Joyner?</t6942>
<t6943>Keep digging.</t6943>
<t6944>—Yes.</t6944> <t6945>Well, you know, it was something that happened to me.</t6945> <t6946>But before he was a minor figure in the drama of my life, he was... well, the central figure in the drama of his own life.</t6946>
<t6947>I have never thought of him as a person either.</t6947> <t6948>A guy who played on the earth like me.</t6948> <t6949>A guy who fell in love like me.</t6949> <t6950>A guy whose threads broke, who didn't feel that the roots of his blade of grass were connected to the field, a guy who was crazy.</t6950> <t6951>Like me.</t6951>
<t6952>—Yes —I say after a while, as I resume digging—.</t6952> <t6953>It was always just a corpse to me.</t6953>
<t6954>—I wish we could have done something —says Margo—.</t6954> <t6955>I wish we could have shown how heroic we were.</t6955>
<t6956>—Yes.</t6956> <t6957>It would have been good to tell him that, whatever it was, it didn't have to be the end of the world.</t6957>
<t6958>—Yes, although in the end whatever it is will kill you.</t6958>
<t6959>I shrug my shoulders.</t6959>
<t6960>—Yes, I know.</t6960> <t6961>I'm not saying that one can survive everything.</t6961> <t6962>Just that one can survive everything, except the last thing.</t6962>
<t6963>I sink my hand again.</t6963> <t6964>The soil here is much darker than in Orlando.</t6964> <t6965>I throw a handful onto the pile behind us and sit down.</t6965> <t6966>An idea is occurring to me, and I try to make my way towards it.</t6966> <t6967>I have never said so many words in a row to Margo in our long and notorious relationship, but here it goes, my last performance for her.</t6967>
<t6968>—When I thought about him dying, which I admit hasn't been many times, I always thought about what you said, that his strings had broken inside him.</t6968> <t6969>But there are a thousand ways to see it.</t6969> <t6970>Maybe the strings break, or maybe our ships sink, or maybe we are grass and our roots are so interdependent that no one is dead as long as someone is alive.</t6970> <t6971>What I mean is that we are not short of metaphors.</t6971> <t6972>But you must be careful with the metaphor you choose, because it is important.</t6972> <t6973>If you choose the strings, you are imagining a world where you can break irreparably.</t6973> <t6974>If you choose the grass, you are saying that we are all infinitely interconnected, that we can use that root system not only to understand each other but to become each other.</t6974> <t6975>Metaphors imply things.</t6975> <t6976>Do you understand what I'm saying?</t6976>
<t6977>Margo nods.</t6977>
<t6978>—I like threads —I continue saying—.</t6978> <t6979>I've always liked them.</t6979> <t6980>Because that's how I feel.</t6980> <t6981>But I think threads make pain seem more fatal than it is.</t6981> <t6982>We are not as fragile as threads would have us believe.</t6982> <t6983>And I also like grass.</t6983> <t6984>The grass has brought me to you, it has helped me imagine you as a real person.</t6984> <t6985>But we are not different sprouts from the same plant.</t6985> <t6986>I cannot be you.</t6986> <t6987>You cannot be me.</t6987> <t6988>You can imagine another... but never perfectly, you know?</t6988>
<t6989>»Maybe it's more like you said before, that we are all cracked.</t6989> <t6990>Each one of us starts off as a sealed vessel.</t6990> <t6991>And things happen.</t6991> <t6992>People leave us, or don't love us, or don't understand us, or we don't understand them, and we get lost, we fail, and we hurt each other.</t6992> <t6993>And the vessel starts to crack in some places.</t6993> <t6994>And, yes, once the vessel cracks, the end is inevitable.</t6994> <t6995>Once the rain starts to get inside the Osprey, it will never be refurbished.</t6995> <t6996>But there's all that time from when the cracks start to open until we finally crumble.</t6996> <t6997>And only in that time can we see each other, because we see what is outside through our cracks, and what is inside can also be seen through them.</t6997> <t6998>When did you and I see each other face to face?</t6998> <t6999>Not until you saw me through my cracks, and I saw you through yours.</t6999> <t7000>Until that moment we only saw ideas of each other, like looking at your blind, but without seeing what was inside.</t7000> <t7001>But when the vessel breaks, the light can enter.</t7001> <t7002>And it can exit.</t7002>
<t7003>She brings her fingers to her lips, as if she were concentrating, or as if she were hiding her mouth from me, or as if she wanted to feel her words.</t7003>
<t7004>—You are special —he finally tells me.</t7004>
<t7005>She looks at me.</t7005> <t7006>My eyes, her eyes, and nothing between them.</t7006> <t7007>I'm not going to gain anything by kissing her, but I no longer intend to gain anything.</t7007>
<t7008>—There is something I have to do —I tell him.</t7008>
<t7009>Nods slightly, as if knowing what that something is.</t7009> <t7010>And I kiss her.</t7010>
<t7011>The kiss ends a while later, when she says to me:</t7011>
<t7012>—You can come to New York.</t7012> <t7013>It will be fun.</t7013> <t7014>It will be like kissing each other.</t7014>
<t7015>—Kissing each other is special —I tell her.</t7015>
<t7016>—You're telling me no —he replies.</t7016>
<t7017>—Margo, my entire life is there, and I am not you, and…</t7017>
<t7018>But I can't say anything more, because he kisses me again, and at the moment he kisses me, I know without the slightest doubt that we are on different paths.</t7018> <t7019>He gets up and heads to where we were lying to grab his backpack.</t7019> <t7020>He takes out the notebook, returns to the grave, and leaves the notebook on the ground.</t7020>
<t7021>—I will miss you —she whispers.</t7021>
<t7022>And I don't know if he is talking to me or to the notebook.</t7022> <t7023>And I also don't know who I'm talking to when I say:</t7023>
<t7024>—Me too.</t7024> <t7025>Go with God, Robert Joyner.</t7025>
<t7026>I throw a handful of dirt onto the notebook.</t7026>
<t7027>—Go with God, young and heroic Quentin Jacobsen —says Margo, also throwing a handful of dirt.</t7027>
<t7028>—Go with God, brave citizen of Orlando Margo Roth Spiegelman —I say, throwing another handful.</t7028>
<t7029>—Go with God, magical little puppy Myrna Mountweazel —says Margo, throwing another handful.</t7029>
<t7030>We pushed the earth over the book and tamped down the soil.</t7030> <t7031>The grass will soon grow back.</t7031> <t7032>For us, it will be the loose and beautiful hair of the graves.</t7032>
<t7033>We return to the Agloe Supermarket holding hands, which are rough from the dirt.</t7033> <t7034>I help Margo load her things into the car: clothes, toiletries, and the chair.</t7034> <t7035>The moment is so precious that, instead of facilitating the conversation, it makes it more difficult.</t7035>
<t7036>We are in front of the parking lot of a one-story motel when the farewell is inevitable.</t7036>
<t7037>—I will get a cell phone and call you —he tells me—.</t7037> <t7038>And I will write you emails.</t7038> <t7039>And mysterious comments on the Omnictionary's page about the paper towns.</t7039>
<t7040>I smile.</t7040>
<t7041>—I will write you an email when we get home —I tell her—, and I expect a reply.</t7041>
<t7042>—Promised.</t7042> <t7043>And we will see each other.</t7043> <t7044>We are not going to stop seeing each other.</t7044>
<t7045>—At the end of summer, I might be able to come see you, before classes start —I tell her.</t7045>
<t7046>—Yes —he answers me—.</t7046> <t7047>Yes, good idea.</t7047>
<t7048>I smile and nod.</t7048> <t7049>He turns around and I'm wondering if he was serious when I see him hunch his shoulders.</t7049> <t7050>He's crying.</t7050>
<t7051>—See you then.</t7051> <t7052>And in the meantime, I'll write to you —I say.</t7052>
<t7053>—Yes —he answers me without turning, with a hoarse voice—.</t7053> <t7054>I will write to you too.</t7054>
<t7055>Saying these things prevents us from falling apart.</t7055> <t7056>And maybe by imagining those futures we can make them real, or maybe not, but in any case, we have to imagine them.</t7056> <t7057>The light overflows and floods everything.</t7057>
<t7058>I am in this parking lot thinking that I have never been so far from home, and here is the girl I love and cannot follow.</t7058> <t7059>I hope this is the hero's mission, because not following her is the hardest thing I have ever done in my life.</t7059>
<t7060>I think he will get into the car, but he doesn't.</t7060> <t7061>In the end, he turns towards me and I see his wet eyes.</t7061> <t7062>The physical space that separates us vanishes.</t7062> <t7063>We touch the broken strings of our instruments for the last time.</t7063>
<t7064>I feel her hands on my back.</t7064> <t7065>And even though it's dark, I don't close my eyes while I kiss her, and neither does Margo.</t7065> <t7066>She is so close to me that I can see her, because even now the external sign of invisible light appears, even at night in this parking lot on the outskirts of Agloe.</t7066> <t7067>After kissing, we look at each other so closely that our foreheads touch.</t7067> <t7068>Yes, I see her almost perfectly in this cracked darkness.</t7068>
<t7069>Author's note</t7069>
<t7070>I found out about the existence of paper towns because I came across one during a road trip in my second-to-last year of university.</t7070> <t7071>My travel companion and I were going back and forth along the same desolate stretch of a South Dakota highway looking for a town that the map assured us existed.</t7071> <t7072>If I remember correctly, the town was called Holen.</t7072> <t7073>In the end, we turned onto a path that led to a house and knocked on the door.</t7073> <t7074>The kind woman who answered had been asked the same question on other occasions.</t7074> <t7075>She explained to us that the town we were looking for only existed on the map.</t7075>
<t7076>The story of Agloe, New York —as described in this book— is mostly true.</t7076> <t7077>Agloe started as a paper town created with the intention of protecting the map's copyright.</t7077> <t7078>But the people who used those old Esso maps searched for it, so someone built a supermarket and made Agloe real.</t7078> <t7079>The cartography business has changed a lot since Otto G. Lindberg and Ernest Alpers invented Agloe.</t7079> <t7080>But many map makers still include paper towns as traps to protect copyright, as evidenced by my puzzling experience in South Dakota.</t7080>
<t7081>The supermarket that was Agloe no longer exists.</t7081> <t7082>But I believe that if we were to put the town back on our maps, someone would eventually rebuild it.</t7082>
