<t0>FIRST PART</t0>
<t1>Strings</t1>
<t2>1</t2>
<t3>The longest day of my life started late.</t3> <t4>I woke up late that Wednesday morning, spent a lot of time in the shower, and had to eat my breakfast in the passenger seat of my mom's minivan at 7:17 AM.</t4>
<t5>Usually, my closest friend Ben Starling would take me to school, but Ben, becoming useless to me, had gone to school on time.</t5> <t6>For us, "on time" was thirty minutes before school started because the half-hour before the first bell was the most important part of our social program: standing in front of the side door to the band room and just talking.</t6> <t7>Most of my friends were in the band, and most of my free time at school was spent within five meters of the band room.</t7> <t8>But I wasn't in the band because I suffered from tone deafness, which is usually associated with actual deafness.</t8> <t9>I was going to be twenty minutes late, which technically meant I would still be there ten minutes before class started.</t9>
<t10>My mom asked me questions about classes, finals, and the prom while she was driving the car.</t10>
<t11>“I don't believe in luck,” I reminded, while turning a corner.</t11> <t12>To adapt to the G-force, I skillfully adjusted the angle of my breakfast cereal.</t12> <t13>I had done this before.</t13>
<t14>“There is no harm in going with a friend.</t14> <t15>I am sure you can invite Cassie Hiney.”</t15> <t16>Despite having an extraordinarily unfortunate last name</t16>
<t17>despite, I could actually invite the quite nice, beautiful, and charming Cassie Hiney.</t17>
<t18>“I don't just dislike balls, I also dislike people who enjoy balls,” I explained, even though it wasn't actually true.</t18> <t19>I was absolutely dying to go.</t19>
<t20>My mom turned towards the school, and I held the nearly empty bowl with both hands as we went over a speed bump.</t20> <t21>I glanced at the senior parking lot.</t21> <t22>Margo Roth Spiegelman's silver Honda was parked in its usual spot.</t22> <t23>My mom turned the car towards a dead end outside the band room and kissed me on the cheek.</t23> <t24>I could see my friends and I standing in a semicircle.</t24>
<t25>I walked towards them, and the semicircle effortlessly expanded to include me.</t25> <t26>They were talking about my ex-girlfriend Suzie Chung, who was attracting everyone's attention by dating a baseball player named Taddy Mac, who apparently played the cello.</t26> <t27>I didn't know if Taddy Mac was his real name.</t27> <t28>But in any case, Suzie had decided to go to the ball with Taddy Mac.</t28> <t29>Another loss.</t29>
<t30>Standing in front of me, Ben said, "Buddy."</t30> <t31>He nodded his head and turned around.</t31> <t32>I followed him towards the door, stepping out of the circle.</t32> <t33>Ben, a small creature with wheat-colored skin who had reached adolescence but hadn't fully entered it, had been my best friend since fifth grade, ever since we both finally accepted that we couldn't attract anyone else as a best friend.</t33> <t34>And Ben tried very hard, which I liked...</t34> <t35>most of the time.</t35>
<t36>"How are you?" I asked. We had entered, and the conversations of the others were preventing ours from being heard.</t36>
<t37>Grumpily, "Radar is going to the prom," he said.</t37> <t38>Radar was our other closest friend.</t38> <t39>We called him Radar because of that old TV show</t39>
<t40>1 Argoda kalça, kıç anlamlarına gelmektedir, (slang.</t40> <t41>n.</t41><t42>)</t42>
<t43>He looked like the guy with the small glasses in M*A*S*H, of course 1.</t43> <t44>The Radar on TV wasn't black and 2.</t44> <t45>A while after we gave him this nickname, our Radar grew fifteen centimeters and started wearing lenses, so I guess 3.</t45> <t46>Actually, he didn't look like the guy in M*A*S*H at all but 4.</t46> <t47>With three and a half weeks left until high school, we weren't going to try giving him a new nickname.</t47>
<t48>“With that girl named Angela?” I asked.</t48> <t49>Radar never talked to us about his love life, but that didn't stop us from frequently speculating.</t49>
<t50>I nodded in agreement.</t50> <t51>“You know, I'm thinking of inviting one of those freshmen to the ball just because they're the only ones who don't know the Bloody Ben story,” he said.</t51> <t52>I nodded in agreement.</t52>
<t53>“So,” said Ben, “this morning a small, cute bunny from the ninth grade came to me and asked if I was Bloody Ben, and I started to explain that it was a kidney infection, the girl giggled and ran away.</t53> <t54>So everything is out in the open.</t54><t55>”</t55>
<t56>Ben was hospitalized in the tenth grade due to a kidney infection, but Margo's best friend, Becca Arrington, spread a rumor that the real reason for blood in Ben's urine was chronic masturbation.</t56> <t57>Although not medically plausible, this story has haunted Ben ever since.</t57> <t58>"Terrible," I said.</t58>
<t59>Ben started outlining plans to arrange a prom date, but I wasn't really listening because I could see Margo Roth Spiegelman among the crowd of people swarming the hallway.</t59> <t60>She was standing right in front of her locker, next to her boyfriend Jase.</t60> <t61>She was wearing a white skirt that came down to her knees and a blue printed top.</t61> <t62>I could see her collarbone.</t62> <t63>She was laughing at something, completely lost in the moment...</t63> <t64>her shoulders hunched forward, the corners of her big eyes wrinkled, her mouth wide open.</t64> <t65>But it didn't seem like it was something Jase had said because she was looking away from him, towards the row of lockers on the opposite side of the hallway.</t65> <t66>I followed her gaze and</t66>
<t67>I saw Becca Arrington clinging all over a baseball player; as if she were an ornament and the kid a Christmas tree.</t67> <t68>Even though I knew she couldn't see me, I smiled at Margo.</t68>
<t69>“Buddy, give it a light.</t69> <t70>Forget about Jase.</t70> <t71>My God, this girl is a sugar-coated bunny.”</t71> <t72>As we walked, I kept glancing at Margo through the crowd; quick, fleeting snapshots: a photo series titled Mortals Pass By, Perfection Stands Still.</t72> <t73>As we got closer, I thought, maybe she wasn’t smiling after all.</t73> <t74>Maybe it was a surprise, maybe she had received a gift or something like that.</t74> <t75>She didn’t seem like she could close her mouth.</t75>
<t76>“Yes,” I said to Ben, still not listening, still trying to see Margo as much as possible without making it too obvious.</t76> <t77>It wasn’t about her being very beautiful or anything.</t77> <t78>Margo was incredible, in the truest sense of the word.</t78> <t79>Then we went far beyond her, there were too many people walking between her and me, and I couldn’t even get close enough to hear her talk or understand what the surprise, which was so funny, was.</t79> <t80>Ben nodded because he had seen me looking at Margo thousands of times and was used to it.</t80>
<t81>"Honestly, Margo is sexy but not that sexy.</t81> <t82>Do you know who is really sexy?</t82><t83>"</t83>
<t84>“Kim?” I asked.</t84>
<t85>“Lacey,” he said.</t85> <t86>Lacey was Margo's other closest friend.</t86> <t87>“And your mom.</t87> <t88>Dude, I saw your mom kiss you on the cheek this morning and sorry, but I swear I was like: Man, I wish I were Q.</t88> <t89>’s place.</t89> <t90>And also, I wish my cheeks had a penis.”</t90> <t91>I elbowed him in the ribs but was still thinking about Margo because she was the only legend who lived next door to us.</t91> <t92>Her full six-syllable name, usually spoken with a kind of awe, Margo Roth Spiegelman.</t92> <t93>Epic adventure stories, Margo Roth Spiegelman who stormed through school like a summer storm: An old man living in a dilapidated house in Hot Coffee, Mississippi, had taught Margo how to play the guitar.</t93> <t94>She spent three days with the circus</t94>
<t95>Margo Roth Spiegelman, who spent her time wandering... they thought she had potential on the trapeze.</t95> <t96>St.</t96> <t97>After a concert in St. Louis, while they were drinking whiskey, Margo Roth Spiegelman was backstage drinking a cup of herbal tea with The Mallionaires.</t97> <t98>Margo Roth Spiegelman, who got into this concert by telling the guard at the door that she was the bassist's girlfriend.</t98> <t99>“Don't you recognize me?</t99> <t100>Come on guys, seriously, my name is Margo Roth Spiegelman, if you go and ask the bassist to take a look at me, he will either tell you that I am his girlfriend or that he wants me to be.”</t100> <t101>When the guard did exactly that, the bassist said, “Yes, she is my girlfriend, let her into the show,” later he tried to hit on Margo, and Margo rejected The Mallionaires' bassist.</t101>
<t102>When stories were shared with others, they inevitably ended with the sentence "So, can you believe it?"</t102> <t103>We usually couldn't believe it, but their truth was always proven.</t103>
<t104>Then we were next to our lockers.</t104> <t105>Radar was leaning against Ben's locker, writing something on a handheld device.</t105>
<t106>I said to Radar, "So you're going to the ball."</t106> <t107>He looked up, then back down again.</t107>
<t108>“I am correcting the vandalism on an Omnictionary2 article about the former French prime minister.</t108> <t109>Last night, someone deleted the entire entry and replaced it with the sentence 'Jacques Chirac is gay,' which is actually incorrect both factually and grammatically.”</t109> <t110>Radar is one of the editors of this internet reference source called Omnictionary, created by users.</t110> <t111>His whole life was dedicated to the maintenance and well-being of Omnictionary.</t111> <t112>This was one of the various reasons why it was so surprising that he was going to the ball with someone.</t112>
<t113>“So, you are going to the ball,” I repeated.</t113>
<t114>An internet encyclopedia similar to Wikipedia.</t114> <t115>After this name was used in the book, a similar website was launched but it is currently out of service, (tr.</t115> <t116>n.</t116><t117>)</t117>
<t118>“Sorry,” he said without raising his head.</t118> <t119>It was a well-known fact by everyone that I was against the ball.</t119> <t120>Nothing about the ball seemed appealing to me at all...</t120> <t121>neither slow dancing, nor fast dancing, nor the dresses nor the rented tuxedos.</t121> <t122>Renting a tuxedo seemed to me like a perfect way to catch a terrible disease from the previous renter, and I wasn't eager to be the world's only virgin carrying pubic lice.</t122>
<t123>“Buddy,” said Ben to Radar, “the chicks know the Bloody Ben story.”</t123> <t124>Radar finally put the gadget he was holding aside and nodded understandingly.</t124> <t125>Ben continued, “Anyway, my remaining two strategies are either to find a prom date online or to fly to Missouri and kidnap a nice, little corn-fed bunny.”</t125> <t126>I had tried to tell Ben that the word “bunny” sounded more sexist and pathetic than “retro,” but he wouldn’t give up the habit.</t126> <t127>He even called his own mother “bunny.”</t127> <t128>There was no way to correct Ben.</t128>
<t129>Radar said, "I will ask Angela if she knows anyone."</t129> <t130>"Though finding you a ball partner will be harder than turning lead into gold.</t130><t131>"</t131>
<t132>“Setting up a ball date for you is so difficult that the very idea itself could actually be used to cut diamonds,” I added.</t132>
<t133>Radar lightly tapped the cabinet twice with his fist to show he agreed and continued with another one.</t133> <t134>"I tell you, getting you a prom date is so difficult that the American government believes the problem can't be solved with diplomacy and instead requires brute force.</t134><t135>"</t135>
<t136>I was trying to think of another one when we all saw, at that moment, the human-shaped anabolic steroid container known as Chuck Parson walking towards us with a purpose.</t136> <t137>Chuck Parson did not participate in sports because it would distract him from the greatest goal of his life: to one day be convicted of murder.</t137> <t138>"Hey, faggots," he called out.</t138>
<t139>As friendly as I could manage, I replied, "Chuck."</t139> <t140>Chuck hadn't caused us any serious problems for a few years...</t140> <t141>someone from the land of the cool kids had issued a decree that we should be left alone.</t141> <t142>So it was a bit strange for him to even talk to us.</t142>
<t143>Maybe because I was talking or maybe for another reason, he placed his hands on the cupboards on either side of me and leaned in so close that I could guess the brand of his toothpaste.</t143> <t144>"What do you know about Margo and Jase?</t144><t145>"</t145>
<t146>“Well,” I said.</t146> <t147>I thought about everything I knew about them: Jase was Margo Roth Spiegelman's first and only serious boyfriend.</t147> <t148>They had started dating at the very end of last year.</t148> <t149>Next year, both of them would be going to the University of Florida.</t149> <t150>Jase had gotten a baseball scholarship there.</t150> <t151>Jase never went to Margo’s house...</t151> <t152>except when he went to pick her up at the door.</t152> <t153>Margo never acted like she liked Jase that much, but then again, she never acted like she liked anyone that much.</t153> <t154>“Nothing,” I said finally.</t154>
<t155>“Don't mess with me,” he roared.</t155>
<t156>“I don't even know Margo properly,” I said, which was true.</t156>
<t157>He reviewed my answer for a moment, and I struggled to look into his closely set eyes.</t157> <t158>He nodded faintly, pulled his hand from the cupboard, and left to attend his first class: Care and Development of Chest Muscles, as the second bell rang.</t158> <t159>There was one minute left until the class started.</t159> <t160>Radar and I had mathematics, while Ben had finite mathematics.</t160> <t161>Our classrooms were adjacent; we walked towards them, trusting that the stream of our classmates would part enough to let us pass, and it did.</t161>
<t162>"It is so difficult to find you a dance partner that if a thousand monkeys typed on a thousand typewriters for a thousand years, they would never once write 'I will go to the dance with you'," I said.</t162>
<t163>Ben kendisini rezil etme cazibesine daha fazla dayanamadı.</t163> <t164>“Baloya dair umutlarım o kadar zayıf ki Q’nun büyükannesi beni reddetti.</t164> <t165>Radar’ın davet etmesini beklediğini söyledi.</t165><t166>”</t166>
<t167>Radar slowly nodded his head.</t167> <t168>"That's true, Q.</t168> <t169>Your grandmother likes brothers.</t169><t170>"</t170>
<t171>Ignoring Chuck and talking about the prom, even though I didn't care at all, was pathetically easy.</t171> <t172>That morning, life was like this: Nothing was that important, neither the good things nor the bad things.</t172> <t173>We were in shared amusement and we were quite successful.</t173>
<t174>Trying not to look at the clocks on various boards, but then looking at the clocks and then being surprised that only a few minutes had passed since I last looked, I spent the next three hours in different classes.</t174> <t175>I had almost four years of experience with looking at these clocks, but their sluggishness surprised me every time.</t175> <t176>If I were told I had only one day left, I would go straight to the sacred corridors of Winter Park High School, where one day felt like a thousand years.</t176>
<t177>Although the third lesson, physics, seemed like it would never end, it finally did, and then I was in the cafeteria with Ben.</t177> <t178>Radar ate lunch during the fifth break with most of our other friends, so the two of us usually sat alone, with two chairs between us and a group of kids we knew from theater.</t178> <t179>Today, we were both eating pepperoni pizza.</t179>
<t180>“Pizza is good,” I said.</t180> <t181>Ben nodded absentmindedly.</t181> <t182>“What’s the matter?” I asked.</t182>
<t183>With a mouthful of pizza, "Hushbish," he said.</t183> <t184>He swallowed.</t184> <t185>"I know you think it's stupid, but I want to go to the ball.</t185><t186>"</t186>
<t187>“1.</t187> <t188>I think so; 2.</t188> <t189>If you want to go, go; 3.</t189> <t190>If I'm not mistaken, you haven't even invited anyone yet.</t190><t191>”</t191>
<t192>“In math class, I invited Cassie Hiney.</t192> <t193>I wrote her a note.”</t193> <t194>I raised my eyebrows inquisitively.</t194> <t195>He reached into his shorts and handed me a piece of paper that was folded many times.</t195> <t196>I unfolded the paper:</t196>
<t197>Ben,</t197>
<t198>I would love to go to the ball with you, but I already</t198>
<t199>I'm going with Frank.</t199> <t200>I'm sorry!</t200>
<t201>—</t201><t202>C</t202>
<t203>I folded the paper again and pushed it across the table.</t203> <t204>I could remember playing football with paper on these tables.</t204> <t205>"Terrible," I said.</t205>
<t206>“Yes, anyway.”</t206> <t207>It felt like we were surrounded by walls of sound and we stayed silent for a while. Then Ben looked at me very seriously and said, “I’m going to have a lot of fun in college and get into the Guinness Book of World Records under the category of ‘Most Satisfied Bunny.’”</t207>
<t208>I laughed.</t208> <t209>When I noticed a cute, black girl with small, pointy dreadlocks standing above us, I was thinking about how Radar's parents were really in the Guinness Book.</t209> <t210>It took me very little time to realize that this girl was Angela, Radar's "presumably girlfriend."</t210>
<t211>“Hello,” he said to me.</t211>
<t212>"Hello," I said.</t212> <t213>I had been in the same class with Angela and knew her a little, but we hadn't greeted each other or said anything in the corridor.</t213> <t214>I motioned for her to sit down.</t214> <t215>She pulled a chair towards the head of the table.</t215>
<t216>Using Radar's real name, he said, "I think you kids know Marcus better than anyone else."</t216> <t217>With his elbows on the table, he leaned towards us.</t217>
<t218>“It's a crappy job, but someone has to do it,” Ben replied with a smile.</t218>
<t219>“Do you think he is ashamed of me?</t219><t220>”</t220>
<t221>I laughed.</t221> <t222>"What? No," he said.</t222>
<t223>“Technically,” I added, “you are not ashamed of him.”</t223><t224>”</t224>
<t225>She rolled her eyes with a smile.</t225> <t226>A girl accustomed to compliments.</t226> <t227>“But he never invited me to hang out with you guys or anything.</t227><t228>”</t228>
<t229>Finally understanding the situation, I said, "Ahhh."</t229> <t230>"The reason is that he is ashamed of us.</t230><t231>"</t231>
<t232>She laughed.</t232> <t233>"You look quite normal.</t233><t234>"</t234>
<t235>"You've never seen me snort Sprite up my nose and then blow it out of my mouth," I said.</t235>
<t236>"I look like a crazy, fizzy fountain," Ben said with a lifeless expression.</t236>
<t237>“But really, wouldn't you be worried?</t237> <t238>I mean, we've been dating for five weeks and he hasn't even taken me to his house.”</t238> <t239>Ben and I exchanged a meaningful look, and I scrunched up my face to suppress my laughter.</t239> <t240>“What?” asked Angela.</t240>
<t241>"Nothing," I said.</t241> <t242>"Honestly, Angela, if she were forcing you to hang out with us and constantly taking you home...</t242><t243>"</t243>
<t244>“It would definitely mean that she doesn't like you,” Ben concluded.</t244>
<t245>“Are their parents weird?</t245><t246>”</t246>
<t247>I struggled to think of how to answer this question honestly.</t247> <t248>"Oh, no, they're good.</t248> <t249>Just a bit overprotective, I guess.</t249><t250>"</t250>
<t251>“Yes, overly protective,” Ben agreed, a bit too quickly.</t251>
<t252>Angela smiled and got up, saying she needed to go greet someone before lunch was over.</t252> <t253>Ben waited until she left to say something.</t253> <t254>Then, he said, "This girl is amazing."</t254>
<t255>“I know,” I replied.</t255> <t256>“I wonder if we can swap it with Radar?</t256><t257>”</t257>
<t258>“Although he is probably not as good with computers as Radar.</t258> <t259>We need someone who understands computers well.</t259> <t260>Besides, I bet he's terrible at Resurrection.”</t260> <t261>Resurrection is our favorite</t261>
<t262>It was a computer game.</t262> <t263>“By the way,” Ben added, “it was a good idea to mention that Radar’s family is overly protective.</t263><t264>”</t264>
<t265>"Well, it wasn't my place to tell Angela," I said.</t265>
<t266>“I wonder how long it will take to see the Radar Team Residence and Museum.”</t266> <t267>Ben smiled.</t267>
<t268>Recess was almost over, so Ben and I got up and put our trays on the conveyor belt.</t268> <t269>The very same belt that, in my first year, Chuck had thrown me onto, sending me into the terrifying hell of Winter Park's dishwashers' union.</t269> <t270>We walked towards Radar's locker, and when Radar ran there right after the first bell, we were still standing in the same place.</t270>
<t271>“During the politics class, I made a decision: If it means I can get through the rest of the semester, I would literally, word for word, lick donkey balls,” said Radar.</t271>
<t272>“You can learn a lot about politics from donkey balls,” I said.</t272> <t273>“Hey, speaking of reasons for wanting to go out for lunch during the fourth recess, we just had lunch with Angela.</t273><t274>”</t274>
<t275>Ben grinned at Radar like a Cheshire cat.</t275> <t276>"Yes, he wonders why he has never been to your house.</t276><t277>"</t277>
<t278>Radar took a deep breath as he entered the code to open his locker.</t278> <t279>He held his breath for so long that I thought I would faint.</t279> <t280>“Damn it,” he finally said.</t280>
<t281>Smiling, I asked, "Are you ashamed of something?"</t281>
<t282>He nudged my stomach with his elbow and replied, "Shut up."</t282>
<t283>"You live in a lovely home," I said.</t283>
<t284>“Dude, seriously,” added Ben.</t284> <t285>“Angela is really a nice girl.</t285> <t286>I don't understand why you haven't introduced her to your family and shown her Casa3 Radar.</t286><t287>”</t287>
<t288>3 (Sp.) House. (pl.</t288> <t289>n.</t289><t290>)</t290>
<t291>He threw the radar books into the cupboard and closed the door.</t291> <t292>The conversations around us quieted a bit as he turned his eyes to the sky and shouted: “IT'S NOT MY FAULT THAT MY PARENTS HAVE THE WORLD'S LARGEST BLACK SANTA CLAUS COLLECTION.</t292><t293>”</t293>
<t294>I must have heard Radar's phrase "the world's largest collection of black Santa Clauses" thousands of times throughout my life, and it never lost its humor.</t294> <t295>But Radar wasn't joking.</t295> <t296>I remembered my first visit there.</t296> <t297>I think I was thirteen years old.</t297> <t298>It was spring, months had passed since Christmas, yet black Santa Clauses were lined up on the window sills.</t298> <t299>Paper black Santa Clauses were hung on the railings.</t299> <t300>The dining table was adorned with black Santa Claus candles.</t300> <t301>A painting of a black Santa Claus in oil paint was hung above the fireplace mantle, which was also decorated with black Santa Claus figurines.</t301> <t302>There were Pez dispensers in the shape of black Santa Clauses from Namibia.</t302> <t303>The lighted plastic black Santa Claus that stood in their tiny front yard from Thanksgiving to New Year's spent the rest of the year proudly guarding the corner of the guest bathroom, which was covered with homemade black Santa Claus wallpaper made from paint and Santa Claus-shaped sponges.</t303> <t304>All the rooms except Radar's were filled with black Santa Clauses...</t304> <t305>plaster, plastic, marble, clay, wood, wax, fabric.</t305> <t306>Radar's parents had more than twelve hundred black Santa Clauses in total, of various kinds.</t306> <t307>As declared on a sign next to their front door, Radar's house was officially registered as a Santa Claus city landmark by the Christmas Society.</t307>
<t308>“Buddy, you need to tell Angela,” I said.</t308> <t309>“What you need to say is this: ‘Angela, I really like you, but there’s something you need to know: When we go to my place and fool around, we will be watched by twelve hundred black Santa Clauses' two thousand four hundred eyes.</t309><t310>”</t310>
<t311>Radar ran his hand through his cropped hair and nodded.</t311> <t312>"Yes, I don't think I would explain it exactly like that, but I'll handle it.</t312><t313>"</t313>
<t314>I set out for the political science class, while I had an elective course on computer game design.</t314> <t315>After attending two more classes and finishing my work, a sense of relief finally spread from my chest throughout my body...</t315> <t316>the end of each day felt like a rehearsal for our graduation, which was less than a month away.</t316>
<t317>I went home.</t317> <t318>Before dinner, I ate two peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.</t318> <t319>I watched poker on TV.</t319> <t320>At six, my parents came home, hugged each other first, then hugged me.</t320> <t321>We ate baked pasta as a proper dinner.</t321> <t322>They asked questions about school.</t322> <t323>They asked questions about the prom.</t323> <t324>They marveled at what a great job they did raising me.</t324> <t325>They talked about their days spent dealing with people who weren't raised as skillfully as I was.</t325> <t326>They went to watch TV.</t326> <t327>I went to my room to check my emails.</t327> <t328>I wrote something about The Great Gatsby for English class.</t328> <t329>I read some of The Federalist Papers in preparation for my political science exam.</t329> <t330>I messaged with Ben online, then Radar came online.</t330> <t331>Radar used the phrase "the world's largest collection of black Santas" four times during our conversation, and I laughed each time.</t331> <t332>I told him I was happy for him because he had a girlfriend.</t332> <t333>He said it was going to be a great summer.</t333> <t334>I agreed.</t334> <t335>It was the fifth of May, but it didn't have to be.</t335> <t336>My days were passing in a happy monotony.</t336> <t337>I had always loved this: I loved the routine.</t337> <t338>I loved being bored.</t338> <t339>I didn't want to, but I loved it.</t339> <t340>So the fifth of May could have been any day... until just before midnight; until Margo Roth Spiegelman, for the first time since she told me to close it nine years ago, pushed open my bedroom window, which no longer had a screen.</t340>
<t341>When I heard the window open, I turned around instantly; Margo's blue eyes were looking at me.</t341> <t342>At first, the only thing I could see were her eyes, but after focusing, I noticed that her face was painted black and she was wearing a black hooded jacket.</t342> <t343>"Are you having virtual sex?" she asked.</t343>
<t344>“I am texting with Ben Starling.</t344><t345>”</t345>
<t346>“This doesn't answer my question, pervert.</t346><t347>”</t347>
<t348>Strangely, I laughed, then walked over there, knelt by the window, and sat down, my face very close to hers.</t348> <t349>I couldn't guess why she was here, at my window, in this manner.</t349> <t350>“To what do I owe this honor?” I asked.</t350> <t351>I was still close with Margo, I think, but not close enough to arrange a “meeting in the dead of night with a face painted black.”</t351> <t352>She had friends for that.</t352> <t353>I just wasn't among them.</t353> <t354>“I need your car,” she explained.</t354>
<t355>“I don't have a car,” I said, which was a sensitive point for me.</t355> <t356>“So I need your mother's car.</t356><t357>”</t357>
<t358>“You have your own car,” I reminded.</t358>
<t359>Margo puffed out her cheeks and sighed.</t359> <t360>“True, but the thing is, my mom and dad took my car keys and locked them in a safe under their bed, and Myma Mountweazel,” Margo’s dog, “is sleeping in their room and the moment she sees me, Myma Mountweazel’s damn aneurysm acts up.</t360> <t361>So</t361>
<t362>actually, I could quietly enter the room, steal the safe, break it open to get my keys, and drive away, but the problem is, it's not even worth trying because even if I just crack the door open, Myrna Mountweazel will bark like crazy.</t362> <t363>So, as I said, I need the car.</t363> <t364>Also, you need to drive because I have to do eleven things tonight and at least five of them require someone to help me escape, buddy.</t364><t365>”</t365>
<t366>When I stopped focusing my gaze, Margo's image turned into just eyes floating in the air.</t366> <t367>Then I locked onto her again and could see the contours of her face, the paint on her skin was still wet.</t367> <t368>Her cheekbones formed a triangle down to her chin, a barely noticeable smile appeared on her pitch-black lips.</t368> <t369>"Will it involve any crime?" I asked.</t369>
<t370>“Hmm,” said Margo.</t370> <t371>“Remind me, was breaking and entering a crime?” I answered firmly, “No.”</t371>
<t372>“No, is it not a crime, or no, I will not help?”</t372> <t373>“No, I will not help.</t373> <t374>Can't you ask one of your minions to drive you around?” Lacey and/or Becca always followed his orders.</t374> <t375>“They are actually part of the problem,” said Margo.</t375>
<t376>“What’s the problem?” I asked.</t376>
<t377>“There are eleven problems,” he said impatiently.</t377>
<t378>“There is no crime,” I said.</t378>
<t379>“I swear you won't need to commit a crime.</t379><t380>”</t380>
<t381>And at that very moment, lights came on all over Margo's house.</t381> <t382>In a single swift motion, Margo tumbled through the window into my room and rolled under my bed.</t382> <t383>Within seconds, her father was standing on the terrace outside.</t383> <t384>“Margo!” he shouted.</t384> <t385>“I saw you!” I heard a muffled voice from under my bed.</t385> <t386>“Oh, God.” Margo quickly emerged from under the bed, stood up, and walked towards the window.</t386> <t387>“Come on, Dad.</t387> <t388>I'm just trying to chat with Quentin.</t388> <t389>You always say how extraordinary Quentin's influence on me can be and all that.</t389><t390>”</t390>
<t391>“Are you just chatting with Quentin?</t391><t392>”</t392>
<t393>“Yes.</t393><t394>”</t394>
<t395>“Then why is there black paint on your face?</t395><t396>”</t396>
<t397>Margo hesitated for a very brief moment.</t397> <t398>“Dad, answering this question would require me to tell stories for hours, and I know you're probably very tired, so just go back...</t398><t399>”</t399>
<t400>“Eve,” roared her father.</t400> <t401>“Immediately!”</t401>
<t402>Margo grabbed my shirt.</t402> <t403>“I will be back in a minute,” she whispered and climbed out the window.</t403>
<t404>As soon as Margo left, I grabbed my keys from my desk.</t404> <t405>The keys are mine, tragically, not the car.</t405> <t406>On my sixteenth birthday, my mom and dad gave me a very small gift, and the moment they handed it to me, I knew it was a car key; I was almost going to pee my pants with excitement because they had repeatedly told me they couldn't afford a car.</t406> <t407>But when they gave me that tiny, wrapped box, I thought they had tricked me and that I finally had a car.</t407> <t408>I tore open the package and quickly opened the small box.</t408> <t409>Indeed, there was a key inside.</t409>
<t410>When I took a closer look, I saw that there was a Chrysler key inside.</t410> <t411>A Chrysler minivan key.</t411> <t412>The exact same Chrysler minivan that my mother owned.</t412>
<t413>I asked my mother, "Is my gift the key to your car?"</t413> <t414>"Tom," she said to my father, "I told you he would get his hopes up.</t414><t415>"</t415>
<t416>My father said, "Ah, don't blame me."</t416> <t417>"You are only cleansing your own frustration with my gain.</t417><t418>"</t418>
<t419>My mother asked, "Isn't this quick analysis a bit passive-aggressive?"</t419>
<t420>“Aren't grandiose accusations about passive aggression essentially passive-aggressive themselves?” replied my father, and they continued like this for a while.</t420>
<t421>Long story short: I had the opportunity to ride in a vehicular marvel, a brand-new Chrysler minivan, except when my mom was using it.</t421> <t422>And since my mom drove to work every day, I could only use the car on weekends.</t422> <t423>On weekends and, of course, in the dead of night.</t423>
<t424>It took Margo longer than the promised minute to return to my window, but not by much.</t424> <t425>However, during the time she was gone, I had been rambling to myself.</t425> <t426>"I have school tomorrow," I said.</t426>
<t427>Margo replied, "Yes, I know."</t427> <t428>'There is school tomorrow and the day after that, thinking about this for too long can drive a girl crazy.</t428> <t429>So yes, there is school tomorrow.</t429> <t430>That's why we have to start, because we need to be back by morning.</t430><t431>"</t431>
<t432>"I don't know.</t432><t433>"</t433>
<t434>“Q,” said Dedi.</t434> <t435>“Q.</t435> <t436>My dear.</t436> <t437>How long have we been good friends?</t437><t438>”</t438>
<t439>“We are not friends, we are neighbors.</t439><t440>”</t440>
<t441>“Ah, my God, Q.</t441> <t442>Am I not treating you well?</t442> <t443>Didn't I order them to be polite to you at school, to use all kinds of commands?</t443><t444>’</t444>
<t445>“Uh-huh,” I replied suspiciously, I had always suspected that it was actually Margo who prevented Chuck Parson and his ilk from bothering us.</t445>
<t446>He winked.</t446> <t447>He had even painted my eyelids.</t447> <t448>“Q,” he said, “we must go.</t448><t449>”</t449>
<t450>I went too.</t450> <t451>I slid out through the window and ran along the side of my house, heads down, until I opened the car doors.</t451> <t452>Margo whispered not to close the doors because it would make too much noise, so with the doors left open, I put the car in neutral, pushed it with my foot, and slid it down the path between the garage and the street.</t452> <t453>I didn't turn on the engine or the headlights</t453>
<t454>Before that, we slowly passed in front of a few houses.</t454> <t455>We closed the doors and then I drove the car through the winding streets of Jefferson Park's infinity, with all the houses still looking new and plastic, like a toy village housing tens of thousands of real people.</t455>
<t456>Margo started talking.</t456> <t457>“The thing is, they don't even care, they just feel like my adventures make them look bad.</t457> <t458>Do you know what my dad just said?</t458> <t459>He said: ‘I don't care if you mess up your life, but don't embarrass us in front of the Jacobsens...</t459> <t460>they are our friends.’</t460> <t461>Ridiculous.</t461> <t462>And you can't even imagine how hard they make it to get out of that damn house.</t462> <t463>You know in prison break movies, they put bundled clothes under the blanket to make it look like someone is there?’ I nodded.</t463> <t464>“Well, my mom put a damn baby monitor in my room so she could hear me breathing all night.</t464> <t465>So I had to pay Ruthie five dollars to sleep in my room and put the bundled clothes in her room.”</t465> <t466>Ruthie is Margo’s sister.</t466> <t467>“Now it’s like damn Mission Impossible.</t467> <t468>I used to be able to sneak out like a regular, damn American...</t468> <t469>just climbing out the window and jumping off the roof was enough.</t469> <t470>But God, these days it’s like living in a fascist dictatorship.</t470><t471>”</t471>
<t472>“Are you going to tell me where we are going?</t472><t473>”</t473>
<t474>“Well, first we are going to Publix.</t474> <t475>Because of reasons I will explain later.</t475> <t476>You need to do grocery shopping for me.</t476> <t477>Then to Walmart.</t477><t478>”</t478>
<t479>"So what, are we going to take a big tour that includes all the commercial businesses in Central Florida?" I asked.</t479>
<t480>“Darling, tonight we will make many wrongs right.</t480> <t481>And we will make some rights wrong.</t481> <t482>The first will be last, the last will be first, and the humble will inherit the earth.</t482> <t483>4 But before radically reshaping the world, go shopping</t483>
<t484>There is a reference to the 4 Gospels, (cf.</t484> <t485>n.</t485><t486>)</t486>
<t487>we are.”</t487> <t488>At this moment, I entered Publix, the parking lot was almost completely empty, I parked.</t488>
<t489>“Listen,” he said, “how much money do you have on you right now?</t489><t490>”</t490>
<t491>“Zero dollars, zero cents,” I replied.</t491> <t492>I turned off the ignition and looked at Margo.</t492> <t493>She reached into the pocket of her tight black jeans and pulled out a few hundred-dollar bills.</t493> <t494>“Luckily, the Almighty God helped,” she said.</t494>
<t495>"Where did this come from?" I asked.</t495>
<t496>“Bat mitzvah money, my friend.</t496> <t497>I'm not allowed to access the account, but I know my parents' password because they use 'myrnamountw3az31' for everything.</t497> <t498>So I withdrew some money.”</t498> <t499>I tried to blink away the awe I felt, but Margo saw the way I was looking at her and grinned at me.</t499> <t500>“Essentially,” she said, “this is going to be the best night of your life.</t500><t501>”</t501>
<t502>5 According to Jewish belief, the ceremony held at the beginning of religious responsibilities on the twelfth birthday of girls, (ed.</t502> <t503>n.</t503><t504>)</t504>
<t505>The thing about Margo Roth Spiegelman was this: All I could do was let her talk and encourage her to continue when she stopped because 1.</t505> <t506>Undoubtedly, I was in love with her and 2.</t506> <t507>Margo was absolutely unparalleled in every way and 3.</t507> <t508>She never really asked me any questions, so the only way to avoid silence was to keep her talking.</t508>
<t509>In the end, in the Publix parking lot, Margo said, "Yes, okay.</t509> <t510>I made you a list.</t510> <t511>If there's a problem, call my cell.</t511> <t512>Look, this reminded me that I put some supplies in the back of the car without asking you beforehand," she said.</t512>
<t513>“So, before I accept all this?</t513><t514>”</t514>
<t515>“Well, yes.</t515> <t516>Technically yes.</t516> <t517>Anyway, if there's a problem, just call me, but you'll get the one that's bigger than your fist when it comes to Vaseline.</t517> <t518>So there's a Baby Vaseline, a Mother Vaseline, and a huge Father Vaseline, you'll get that one.</t518> <t519>If they don't have that, then get about three of the mothers.” Handing over the list and the hundred-dollar bill, “This will be enough,” he said.</t519> <t520>Margo’s list:</t520>
<t521>3 catfish, individually packaged</t521>
<t522>Veet (You Don't Need a Razor Just to Shave Your Legs Girl</t522>
<t523>cosmetic items there)</t523>
<t524>Vaseline</t524>
<t525>six-pack of Mountain Dew A dozen Tulips A Bottle of water Napkin</t525>
<t526>a can of blue spray paint</t526>
<t527>“Interesting use of capitalization,” I said.</t527>
<t528>“Yes.</t528> <t529>I'm in favor of using random capital letters.</t529> <t530>The rules for using capital letters are not fair to the words in the middle.</t530><t531>”</t531>
<t532>Now, I'm not sure what to say to the woman at the checkout when you put about six kilos of catfish, Veet, a huge "big daddy size" Vaseline, six cans of Mountain Dew, a can of blue spray paint, and a dozen tulips on the conveyor belt at half past midnight.</t532> <t533>But what I said was: "It's not as weird as it looks.</t533><t534>"</t534>
<t535>The woman cleared her throat but did not lift her head.</t535> <t536>"Still strange," she grumbled.</t536>
<t537>When we got back to the car, as Margo used the water from the bottle to clean the black paint off her face with a napkin, I said, "I really don't want to get into trouble."</t537> <t538>Apparently, she only needed the makeup to leave the house.</t538> <t539>"In my acceptance letter from Duke University, it clearly states that if I get arrested, they won't take me.</t539><t540>"</t540>
<t541>“You worry too much, Q.</t541><t542>”</t542>
<t543>“Look, please, let's just not get into trouble,” I said.</t543> <t544>‘I mean, I want to have fun and all, but not at the expense of my future.</t544><t545>”</t545>
<t546>He lifted his head and looked at me, most of his face now revealed, and he smiled a little.</t546> <t547>“I am amazed that you find even a bit of this nonsense interesting.</t547><t548>”</t548>
<t549>“What?</t549><t550>”</t550>
<t551>“University: to enter or not to enter.</t551> <t552>Trouble: to get involved or not to get involved.</t552> <t553>School: to get an A or to get a D.</t553> <t554>Career: to have or not to have.</t554> <t555>Home: big or small, to buy or to rent.</t555> <t556>Money: to have or not to have.</t556> <t557>All of it is very boring.</t557><t558>”</t558>
<t559>I started to say something, noting that it was clear she cared a bit because she had good grades and was going to the honors program at the University of Florida next year, when she simply said, "Walmart."</t559>
<t560>We entered Walmart together and bought that thing from the commercials, called The Club, which locks the steering wheel in place.</t560> <t561>As we walked towards the children's section, I asked Margo, "Why do we need The Club?"</t561>
<t562>Margo, as usual, managed to speak in her crazy monologue without answering my question.</t562> <t563>“Did you know that for almost all of human history, the average lifespan was less than thirty years?</t563> <t564>You could only count on living a real adulthood for about ten years, right?</t564> <t565>There was no planning for retirement.</t565> <t566>There was no planning for a career.</t566> <t567>There was no planning.</t567> <t568>There was no time to make plans.</t568> <t569>There was no time for the future.</t569> <t570>But then lifespans started to increase, and people began to have more and more of a future, so they spent more time thinking about it.</t570> <t571>About the future.</t571> <t572>And now life has become the future.</t572> <t573>Every moment of your life is lived for the future...</t573> <t574>you go to high school so you can go to college, so you can get a good job, so you can buy a nice house, so you can afford to send your kids to college, so your kids can get a good job, so they can buy a nice house, so they can afford to send their kids to college.</t574><t575>”</t575>
<t576>It seemed like Margo was talking nonsense just to avoid the question I had asked.</t576> <t577>So I repeated it.</t577> <t578>"Why do we need The Club?</t578><t579>"</t579>
<t580>Margo gently patted my shoulder.</t580> <t581>“I mean, it's obvious M, all of this will come out before the night is over.”</t581> <t582>Then she found a horn among the boating supplies.</t582> <t583>She took the horn out of its box and raised it in the air, “No,” I said, “What no?” she said.</t583> <t584>I said, “No, don't blow the horn,” but as I got to the 'b' of 'blow,' Margo squeezed the horn and it emitted an unbearably loud sound that felt like the auditory equivalent of an aneurysm in my head.</t584> <t585>Then, “Sorry, I couldn't hear you.</t585> <t586>What did you say?” she said.</t586> <t587>“Don't bl...” I said and then she did it again.</t587>
<t588>A Walmart employee, just a bit older than us, came up to us and said, "Hey, you can't use that here," and Margo, with a supposedly sincere attitude, said, "Sorry, I didn't know," then the kid said, "Oh, it's no big deal. </t588> <t589>It doesn't bother me, actually," he said.</t589> <t590>After that, the conversation seemed to be over, but the kid couldn't stop looking at Margo, and honestly, I can't blame him because it's hard to take your eyes off Margo. Finally, he asked, "What are you doing tonight?"</t590>
<t591>Margo said, "We're not doing much.</t591> <t592>You?"</t592>
<t593>Hey kid, "I'm going out for a bit, then I'll go to the bar in Orange... if you want to come.</t593> <t594>But you have to drop your brother off at home; they're really strict about IDs," he said.</t594>
<t595>What's wrong with Margo?!</t595> <t596>"I'm not her sister," I said, looking at the child's sneakers.</t596>
<t597>Then Margo continued to lie.</t597> <t598>"Actually, my cousin," she said.</t598> <t599>Then she snuggled up to me, wrapped her hand around my waist so I could feel each of her fingers wandering on my hip bone, and added: "And my lover.</t599><t600>"</t600>
<t601>The child just rolled their eyes and walked away from us, Margo's hand stayed on my waist for a minute, giving me the chance to wrap my arm around her.</t601> <t602>"You are really my favorite cousin," I said.</t602> <t603>She smiled and, as she turned to free herself from my arms, she lightly bumped me with her hip.</t603>
<t604>“Wouldn't I know,” he said.</t604>
<t605>He was driving on the completely empty I4 with the car, and I was following Margo's directions.</t605> <t606>The clock on the control panel showed 01:07.</t606>
<t607>"Beautiful, isn't it?" said Margo.</t607> <t608>She had turned to the other side, and I could barely see her because she was looking out the window.</t608> <t609>"I love speeding through the lit-up streets.</t609><t610>"</t610>
<t611>“Light,” I said, “The visible reminder of Invisible Light.</t611><t612>”</t612>
<t613>"Very beautiful," he said.</t613>
<t614>“T.</t614> <t615>S.</t615> <t616>Eliot,” I said.</t616> <t617>“You read this too.</t617> <t618>In last year's literature class.”</t618> <t619>In fact, I had never read the entire poem from which this line was taken, but a few sections I had read were etched in my mind.</t619>
<t620>“Ah, a quote, I see,” he said, somewhat disappointed.</t620> <t621>I saw his hand on the center console.</t621> <t622>I could have placed my hand on the center console too, and our hands would have been in the same place at the same time.</t622> <t623>But I didn't.</t623> <t624>“Say it again,” he said.</t624>
<t625>“Light is the visible reminder of the Invisible Light.</t625><t626>”</t626>
<t627>"Damn, it's really good."</t627> <t628>"It must be working with your girlfriend."</t628> <t629>"Ex-girlfriend," I corrected him.</t629>
<t630>“Did Suzie leave you?” asked Margo.</t630>
<t631>"How do you know that she left me?</t631><t632>"</t632>
<t633>‘</t633><t634>‘Ali, I am sorry.</t634><t635>”</t635>
<t636>“Well, he did,” I admitted, and Margo laughed.</t636> <t637>We had broken up months ago, but I didn't blame Margo for not being interested in the love life of the lower class.</t637> <t638>What happens in the band room, stays in the band room.</t638>
<t639>Margo placed her feet on the front panel and wiggled her toes in rhythm with her speech.</t639> <t640>She always spoke in this way, with a noticeable rhythm, as if reciting a poem from memory.</t640> <t641>"Well, okay, I'm sorry to hear that.</t641> <t642>But it's quite understandable.</t642> <t643>It just so happens that my lovely boyfriend of many months is screwing my best friend."</t643> <t644>I looked at her, but her hair covered her entire face, so I couldn't tell if she was joking.</t644> <t645>"Really?"</t645> <t646>She said nothing.</t646> <t647>"But you were laughing with him just this morning.</t647> <t648>I saw you."</t648> <t649>"I don't know what you're talking about.</t649> <t650>I heard what happened before the first class, then I found them talking together and started yelling and screaming.</t650> <t651>Becca ran into Clint Bauer's arms, and Jase stood there like an imbecile with a mouthful of drool dripping from his stinking mouth."</t651> <t652>Clearly, I had misinterpreted the scene in the hallway.</t652> <t653>"Weird, because Chuck Parson asked me this morning what I knew about you and Jase.</t653><t654>"</t654>
<t655>“Yes, well, Chuck must have done what he was told.</t655> <t656>He was probably trying to find out who knew about the incident on behalf of Jase.” “God, why would he hang out with Becca?</t656><t657>’</t657>
<t658>“Well, Becca isn't known for her personality or generous spirit, so it's probably because she's sexy.</t658><t659>”</t659>
<t660>"Not as sexy as you," I said before I could think.</t660>
<t661>“This always seemed very silly to me, that people want to be around someone just because they are beautiful.</t661> <t662>Like choosing your breakfast cereal based on its color rather than its taste.</t662> <t663>Next exit, by the way.</t663> <t664>But I'm not beautiful, at least not up close.</t664> <t665>Generally, the closer people get to me, the less sexy they find me.” “This...” I began.</t665>
<t666>“Anyway,” he replied.</t666>
<t667>It seemed quite unfair that an asshole like Jason Worthington could sleep with both Margo and Becca, while someone as undoubtedly nice as me couldn't sleep with either of them or anyone else.</t667> <t668>Although I prefer to think that I'm the kind of person who wouldn't hang out with Becca Arrington.</t668> <t669>Becca may be sexy, but she is also 1. incredibly dumb and 2.</t669> <t670>an absolute, pure whore.</t670> <t671>As the ones who often hung out in the band room, we had long suspected that Becca maintained her cute appearance by eating nothing but the souls of kittens and the dreams of poor children.</t671> <t672>"Becca is really kind of bad," I said, trying to pull Margo back into the conversation.</t672>
<t673>“Yes,” replied the passenger while looking out the window, her hair reflecting the approaching street lights.</t673> <t674>For a moment, I thought she might be crying, but she quickly composed herself by putting on her hood and taking The Club out of a Walmart bag.</t674> <t675>As she tore open the package of The Club, she said, “Well, at least this will be fun.”</t675>
<t676>“Can I ask where we are going now?</t676><t677>”</t677>
<t678>“Becca’lara,” he replied.</t678>
<t679>“Oh no,” I said as I pulled up to a stop sign.</t679> <t680>I parked the minivan and started to tell Margo that I would take her home.</t680>
<t681>“We will not commit a crime.</t681> <t682>Promise.</t682> <t683>We need to find Jase's car.</t683> <t684>Becca's street is the next one on the right, but Jase wouldn't park his car on Becca's street because her parents are home.</t684> <t685>Try the next one after that.</t685> <t686>This is the first task.</t686><t687>”</t687>
<t688>“Alright,” I said, “but then we are going home.</t688><t689>”</t689>
<t690>“No, then we move on to Chapter Eleven, Part Two.</t690><t691>”</t691>
<t692>“Margo, this is a bad idea.</t692><t693>”</t693>
<t694>“Just drive,” he said, so I just drove.</t694> <t695>Jase's Lexus was parked two blocks away from Becca's street, in a dead end.</t695>
<t696>we found it.</t696> <t697>Before I could completely stop the car, Margo jumped out with The Club in her hand.</t697> <t698>She opened the driver's side door of the Lexus, sat in the seat, and attached The Club to the steering wheel.</t698> <t699>Then she slowly closed the door of the Lexus.</t699>
<t700>While getting back into the minivan, he grumbled, "The idiot never locks his car."</t700> <t701>He put The Club's key in his pocket.</t701> <t702>He reached out to me and ruffled my hair.</t702> <t703>"Part One complete.</t703> <t704>Now, to Becca's house.</t704><t705>"</t705>
<t706>While driving the car, Margo explained the Second and Third Sections to me.</t706>
<t707>"This is really clever," I said, despite feeling a shaky tension inside.</t707>
<t708>I turned onto Becca's street and parked the car two houses before their ugly mansion.</t708> <t709>Margo crawled to the back of the car and returned with binoculars and a digital camera.</t709> <t710>She looked through the binoculars first, then handed them to me.</t710> <t711>I could see a light on in the basement of the house, but there was no movement.</t711> <t712>I was more surprised that the house even had a basement...</t712> <t713>In Orlando, we can't dig too deep without hitting water.</t713>
<t714>I reached into my pocket, took out my phone, and dialed the number Margo had given me.</t714> <t715>The phone rang once, rang twice, and then a groggy male voice answered: "Hello?"</t715><t716>"</t716>
<t717>"Bay Arrington?" I asked.</t717> <t718>Margo wanted me to call because no one would recognize my voice.</t718>
<t719>“Who are you?</t719> <t720>My God, what time is it?</t720><t721>”</t721>
<t722>"Sir, you need to know that your daughter is currently making love with Jason Worthington in your basement."</t722> <t723>Then I hung up the phone, Chapter Two: Done.</t723>
<t724>We opened my doors wide with Margo and took our places lying on the ground just behind the fence surrounding Becca's garden.</t724> <t725>Margo handed me the camera and I</t725>
<t726>I watched the lights turn on in the bedroom upstairs, then on the stairs, and finally in the kitchen.</t726> <t727>Finally, a light turned on in the stairs leading to the basement.</t727>
<t728>“Here he comes,” Margo whispered, I didn't understand what she meant...</t728> <t729>until I saw out of the corner of my eye that shirtless Jason Worthington was trying to climb out of the basement window.</t729> <t730>As Jase crossed the lawn, he started running quickly, he was naked except for his boxers, as he approached, I stood up and took his photo, thus completing Chapter Three.</t730> <t731>I think the flash surprised both of us, a warm and white moment, he looked at me from within the darkness and ran off into the night.</t731>
<t732>Margo tugged at the hem of my jeans; I looked down at her, she was grinning foolishly.</t732> <t733>I reached out my hand to help her up, then we ran back towards the car again.</t733> <t734>As I was putting the key in the ignition, Margo said, "Wait, let me see the photo."</t734>
<t735>I handed over the camera and we watched the photo develop on the screen together, our heads almost touching.</t735> <t736>I couldn't help but laugh when I saw Jase's dazed, pale face.</t736>
<t737>“Ah, Tannm,” said Margo, pointing to a spot with her finger.</t737> <t738>Since Jason had hurried out, it seemed like he hadn't managed to tuck Little Jason into his boxers, and there it was, hanging out and digitally captured for future generations.</t738>
<t739>“This is a penis,” said Margo.</t739> <t740>“Just like Rhode Island being a state: it may have a famous story, but it is definitely not big.</t740><t741>”</t741>
<t742>I looked at the house again and noticed that the basement light was now off.</t742> <t743>I found myself feeling vaguely sorry for Jason...</t743> <t744>it wasn't his fault that he had a small penis and both a smart and vindictive girlfriend.</t744> <t745>But on the other hand, in sixth grade, Jase had promised not to punch my arm if I ate a live worm, so I ate a live worm, but then he punched me in the face.</t745> <t746>So I didn't feel sorry for him for very long.</t746>
<t747>When I looked at Margo, she was watching the house with her binoculars.</t747> <t748>"We must go," she said.</t748> <t749>"To the basement.</t749><t750>"</t750>
<t751>“What? Why?</t751><t752>”</t752>
<t753>“Chapter Four.</t753> <t754>Getting Jase's clothes in case he sneaks back into the house.</t754> <t755>Chapter Five.</t755> <t756>Leaving the fish for Becca.</t756><t757>”</t757>
<t758>"No.</t758><t759>"</t759>
<t760>“Yes.</t760> <t761>Now,” he said.</t761> <t762>“Becca is upstairs, being scolded by her parents.</t762> <t763>But I mean, how long can that scolding last?</t763> <t764>I mean, what do you think?</t764> <t765>‘You shouldn't be screwing Margo's boyfriend in the basement.’</t765> <t766>That's a one-sentence scolding.</t766> <t767>So we need to hurry.</t767><t768>”</t768>
<t769>He got out of the car with spray paint in one hand and one of the catfish in the other.</t769> <t770>“This is a bad idea,” I whispered, but I followed him, crouching like him, until he stopped in front of the still-open basement window.</t770>
<t771>“I will go in first,” he said.</t771> <t772>He went in with his feet first, half inside the house and half outside, standing on Becca's computer desk, and I asked, “Can't I just be a lookout?”</t772>
<t773>“Move your skinny ass,” he replied, and I did so.</t773> <t774>I quickly grabbed all the men's clothes I saw on Becca's lilac carpeted floor.</t774> <t775>A pair of jeans with a leather belt, a pair of sandals, a Winter Park High School Wildcats baseball cap, and a baby blue polo shirt.</t775> <t776>I turned to Margo, who handed me the catfish wrapped in paper and one of Becca's glittery purple pens.</t776> <t777>She told me what to write:</t777>
<t778>A message from Margo Roth Spiegelman: Your friendship with her...</t778> <t779>sleeps with the fishes6</t779>
<t780>Margo hid the fish among Becca's folded shorts in the closet.</t780> <t781>I could hear footsteps coming from upstairs, I lightly tapped Margo on the shoulder and looked at her, my eyes wide open.</t781>
<t782>A phrase generally used in situations involving the mafia, meaning "killed and thrown into the sea," (abbr.</t782> <t783>n.</t783><t784>)</t784>
<t785>It had burst out.</t785> <t786>She just smiled and took out the spray paint without hurrying.</t786> <t787>I barely climbed out the window, and as Margo leaned over the table and calmly shook the spray paint, I turned back to watch her.</t787> <t788>With an elegant movement that you might associate with calligraphy or Zorro, she wrote the letter M on the wall behind the table with the spray paint.</t788>
<t789>He reached his hands out to me, and I pulled him out of the window.</t789> <t790>Just as he was starting to stand up, we heard a very shrill voice shouting, "DWIGHT!"</t790> <t791>I grabbed the clothes and started running, Margo was behind me.</t791>
<t792>I heard the front door of Becca's house open, but I didn't see it. Nevertheless, I didn't stop or turn around, neither when a thunderous voice shouted, "STOP!" nor when I heard the sound of a shotgun being fired.</t792>
<t793>Margo’s voice behind me, when I murmured “Gun,” didn’t seem particularly upset about the subject; she was just observing. Then, instead of walking around Becca’s hedge, I jumped over it, ducking my head.</t793> <t794>I wasn’t sure how I planned to land—maybe I had thought of a skillful somersault or something like that—but in any case, I fell onto the asphalt on my left shoulder.</t794> <t795>Luckily, Jase’s clothes, which cushioned my fall, hit the ground first.</t795>
<t796>I cursed, and even before I started to get up, I felt Margo's hands pulling me up, finally we were in the car and I was driving backward with the headlights off, and this is how I almost ran over a naked player from the Winter Park High School Wildcats baseball team.</t796> <t797>Jase was running very fast but didn't seem to be running towards any particular place.</t797> <t798>As we passed him while driving backward, I felt another pang of regret, so I rolled the window halfway down and threw his shirt towards him.</t798> <t799>Luckily, I don't think Jase saw either me or Margo, and since I couldn't drive to school, I dwelled on this</t799>
<t800>I don't want to look like a jerk, and there was no reason to get to know the minivan.</t800>
<t801>As Ben turned on the headlights and drove forward, navigating out of the suburban labyrinth back towards the interstate, Margo asked, "Why did you do such a thing?"</t801>
<t802>“I felt sorry for him.</t802><t803>”</t803>
<t804>“For him? Why?</t804> <t805>Because he has been cheating on me for six weeks?</t805> <t806>Because he has probably given me some disease, God knows what?</t806> <t807>Because he is likely to be a rich and happy disgusting fool all his life, thus proving the absolute injustice of the universe?</t807><t808>”</t808>
<t809>“She just looked desperate,” I said.</t809>
<t810>“Anyway.</t810> <t811>We are going to Karin's house.</t811> <t812>In Pennsylvania, near ABC Liquors.</t812><t813>”</t813>
<t814>"Don't be mad at me," I said.</t814> <t815>"Just a moment ago, a man pointed his damn rifle at me because I helped you, so don't be mad at me.</t815><t816>"</t816>
<t817>“I'M NOT MAD AT YOU!” he shouted, then punched the control panel.</t817>
<t818>“Well, you are screaming.</t818><t819>”</t819>
<t820>“I thought maybe...</t820> <t821>whatever.</t821> <t822>I thought maybe she wasn't cheating on me.</t822><t823>”</t823>
<t824>‘Yes.</t824><t825>’</t825>
<t826>“Karin told me at school.</t826> <t827>I think many people have known for a long time and no one said anything until Karin did.</t827> <t828>I also thought that maybe Karin was trying to stir things up.</t828><t829>”</t829>
<t830>“I'm sorry.</t830><t831>”</t831>
<t832>“Yes.</t832> <t833>Yes.</t833> <t834>I can't even believe that I care.</t834><t835>”</t835>
<t836>“My heart is pounding,” I said.</t836>
<t837>“This is how you know you're having fun,” said Margo.</t837>
<t838>But it didn't feel like fun, it was more like a heart attack.</t838> <t839>I pulled into the 7Eleven parking lot and placed my finger on my carotid artery, watching the two dots on the digital clock blink every second.</t839> <t840>When I turned to Margo, she was rolling her eyes at me.</t840> <t841>“My pulse is dangerously fast,” I explained.</t841>
<t842>“I can't even remember the last time I was excited about something like this.</t842> <t843>Adrenaline is spreading through your throat and lungs.</t843><t844>”</t844>
<t845>"Inhale through your nose, exhale through your mouth," I replied.</t845>
<t846>“All those little worries.</t846> <t847>Just very...</t847><t848>”</t848>
<t849>“Cute?</t849><t850>”</t850>
<t851>“Is this what they say instead of childish these days?” She smiled.</t851>
<t852>Margo crawled towards the back seat and returned with a handbag.</t852> <t853>How much junk has she put in the back? I wondered.</t853> <t854>She opened the bag and took out a full nail polish, so dark red that it almost looked black.</t854> <t855>Smiling at me through her bangs, she said, "I'll paint my nails while you calm down."</t855> <t856>"Take your time.</t856><t857>"</t857>
<t858>And we just sat there, with her nail polish that she had put on for that panel, and me with a finger trembling on my own pulse.</t858> <t859>It was a nice nail polish color, and Margo also had beautiful fingers; they were thinner and more bony than the rest of her body, which was made up of curves and soft edges.</t859>
<t860>They were the kind you would want to intertwine with your own fingers.</t860> <t861>I remembered the time they were on my hip bone at Walmart, it felt like it was days ago.</t861> <t862>My heartbeat slowed down.</t862> <t863>I tried to tell myself that Margo was right.</t863> <t864>Here, in this quiet night.</t864> <t865>There was nothing to fear in this small town.</t865>
<t866>5</t866>
<t867>“Chapter Six,” said Margo as soon as they set off again.</t867> <t868>She was waving her fingers in the air as if she were playing the piano.</t868> <t869>“Leaving the apology letter and flowers on Karin’s doorstep.</t869><t870>”</t870>
<t871>“What did you do to her?</t871><t872>”</t872>
<t873>"Well, when he mentioned Jase, I didn't really think 'don't shoot the messenger.'</t873><t874>"</t874>
<t875>“What do you mean?” I asked.</t875> <t876>We were caught at a red light, and a few kids in the sports car next to us were revving their engine...</t876> <t877>as if I was going to race the Chrysler.</t877> <t878>When you floored the Chrysler, it would only groan.</t878>
<t879>“Well, I don't remember exactly what I said to her, but it was something like ‘snotty, disgusting, stupid, acne-backed, broken-toothed, worst hair in Florida, big-assed whore,’ you can figure out the rest.</t879><t880>”</t880>
<t881>“His hair is really ridiculous,” I said.</t881>
<t882>“I know.</t882> <t883>The only true thing I said about him was this: when you say bad things about people, you should never mention the true ones because it’s impossible to take them back completely.</t883> <t884>So, there is such a thing as highlights.</t884> <t885>There is such a thing as shadow.</t885> <t886>And there is such a thing as looking like a skunk.</t886><t887>”</t887>
<t888>As Ben was driving towards Karin's house, Margo disappeared in the back and returned with a bouquet of tulips.</t888>
<t889>One of the flowers had a note attached to it, folded to look like an envelope.</t889> <t890>As soon as we stopped, Margo handed me the bouquet, I quickly ran up the sidewalk, placed the flowers on Karin's doorstep, and ran back.</t890>
<t891>“Chapter Seven,” he said as soon as I turned around.</t891> <t892>“Leaving a fish for the charming Mr. Worthington.</t892><t893>”</t893>
<t894>“He might not have returned home yet,” I said with a faint trace of pity in my voice.</t894>
<t895>“Let's hope that a week from now, the police find him barefoot, naked, and insane in a ditch by the roadside,” Margo responded calmly.</t895>
<t896>“Remind me to never go against Margo Roth Spiegelman,” I muttered, and Margo laughed.</t896>
<t897>“Seriously,” he said.</t897> <t898>“We are bringing a curse storm upon our enemies.</t898><t899>”</t899>
<t900>"Your enemies," I corrected.</t900>
<t901>“We will see,” he replied quickly, then he cheered up.</t901> <t902>“Oh, hey, I will handle this.</t902> <t903>The thing about Jason's house is that it has an insanely good security system.</t903> <t904>And we can't go through another panic attack.</t904><t905>”</t905>
<t906>“Hmm,” I said.</t906>
<t907>Jason lived a little further from Karin, in a super-rich neighborhood called Casavilla.</t907> <t908>All the houses in Casavilla were in the Spanish style with red-tiled roofs and such, but they were not built by Spaniards.</t908> <t909>They were built by Jason's father, one of the richest land developers in Florida.</t909> <t910>As we entered Casavilla, I said to Margo, "Big, ugly houses for big, ugly people."</t910>
<t911>“No way.</t911> <t912>If I ever become the kind of person with a child and seven bedrooms, do me a favor and shoot me.</t912><t913>”</t913>
<t914>We stopped in front of Jase's house, an architectural monstrosity that generally looked like an overly large Spanish ranch, except for the three thick Doric columns leading up to the roof.</t914> <t915>Margo grabbed the second catfish from the back seat, opened the cap of a pen with her teeth, and scribbled something in a handwriting that didn't resemble her own.</t915>
<t916>MS's love for you: Sleeping with the fishes</t916>
<t917>"Keep the car running," he said.</t917> <t918>Jase put his baseball cap on backwards.</t918>
<t919>"Okay," I said.</t919>
<t920>“Keep the car on the street,” he said.</t920>
<t921>“Okay,” I said and felt my pulse quicken.</t921> <t922>In through the nose, out through the mouth.</t922> <t923>In through the nose, out through the mouth.</t923> <t924>Margo, holding a catfish and spray paint, flung the door wide open and ran across the Worthingtons' vast lawn, then hid behind an oak tree.</t924> <t925>She waved at me from the darkness, I waved back, then she dramatically took a deep breath, puffed out her cheeks, turned, and ran.</t925>
<t926>He had only taken one step when the house lit up like a Christmas tree and a siren started blaring.</t926> <t927>For a very brief moment, I thought about leaving Margo to her fate, but as she ran towards the house, I continued to breathe in through my nose and out through my mouth.</t927> <t928>She threw the fish towards a window, but the sirens were so loud that I could barely hear the glass shatter.</t928> <t929>Then, because she was Margo Roth Spiegelman, she took a minute to carefully spray-paint a beautiful M on the unbroken part of the window.</t929> <t930>Then she started running towards the car with all her might, one foot on the gas pedal and the other on the brake, and at that moment, the Chrysler felt like a purebred racehorse.</t930> <t931>Margo was running so fast that her hat flew off, then she jumped into the car and we sped away before she could even close the door.</t931>
<t932>At the stop sign at the end of the street, I stopped, and Margo said, "What the hell are you doing? </t932><t933>Keep going, keep going," and I said, "Oh, right," because I had forgotten that I had thrown caution to the wind.</t933><t934>I passed the other three stop signs on Casavilla and we had gone about a kilometer on Pennsylvania Avenue before we saw a police car with its lights on passing by us.</t934>
<t935>“Oh, it was so dirty haha,” said Margo.</t935> <t936>“I mean, even for me.</t936> <t937>If we were to explain it Q-style, my pulse quickened a bit.</t937><t938>”</t938>
<t939>“My God,” I said.</t939> <t940>‘I mean, couldn't you have left the fish in your car or something?</t940> <t941>Or at least on the doorstep?</t941><t942>”</t942>
<t943>“We are bringing the cursed rain, Q.</t943> <t944>Not the fallout.</t944><t945>”</t945>
<t946>“Please tell me that Chapter Eight is less scary.</t946><t947>”</t947>
<t948>“Don't worry.</t948> <t949>The Eighth Chapter is a piece of cake.</t949> <t950>We're going back to Jefferson Park.</t950> <t951>To Lacey's house.</t951> <t952>You know where she lives, right?”</t952> <t953>I did know, though God knows, Lacey Pemberton would never deign to host me at her house.</t953> <t954>She lived on the other side of Jefferson Park, a kilometer away from me, in a nice apartment above a stationery store...</t954> <t955>actually on the same block where the dead man lived.</t955> <t956>I had been to that building before because a friend of my parents lived on the third floor.</t956> <t957>There were two locked doors before you could even reach the apartments.</t957> <t958>I guessed that even Margo Roth Spiegelman wouldn't be able to get in there.</t958>
<t959>“So, was Lacey naughty or well-behaved?” I asked.</t959>
<t960>“Lacey was really naughty,” answered Margo.</t960> <t961>She was looking out the window again, talking away from me, so I could barely hear her.</t961> <t962>“I mean, we've been friends since kindergarten.</t962><t963>”</t963>
<t964>‘You?</t964><t965>”</t965>
<t966>“And he didn't tell me anything about Jase.</t966> <t967>But that's not all.</t967> <t968>Looking back, he's a downright terrible friend.</t968> <t969>I mean, for example, do you think I'm fat?</t969><t970>”</t970>
<t971>“My God, no,” I said.</t971> <t972>“You...”</t972> <t973>Then I stopped myself from saying: You’re not skinny, but that’s your most important feature; your most important feature is that you don’t look like a boy.</t973> <t974>“You shouldn’t lose weight.”</t974> <t975>She laughed, waved her hand at me, and said, “You just love my big butt.”</t975> <t976>For a second, I took my eyes off the road and looked at her, I shouldn’t have because she could read my expression and my expression said: Well, first of all, I wouldn’t exactly say big, secondly, it’s really remarkable.</t976> <t977>But there was more to it than that.</t977> <t978>You can’t separate the human Margo from the body Margo.</t978> <t979>You can’t see one without seeing the other.</t979> <t980>You look into Margo’s eyes and see both their blueness and their Margo-ness.</t980> <t981>As a result, you couldn’t say Margo Roth Spiegelman was fat or skinny, just like you couldn’t say the Eiffel Tower was lonely or not.</t981> <t982>Margo’s beauty was like a kind of vehicle sealed with perfection...</t982> <t983>unbroken and unbreakable.</t983>
<t984>“But Lacey kept making these little comments,” Margo continued.</t984> <t985>‘“I would lend you these shorts, but I don't think they would fit you.’</t985> <t986>Or, ‘You're so brave.</t986> <t987>I love how you make guys fall in love with your personality.’</t987> <t988>She always tried to hurt me.</t988> <t989>I don't think she ever said a single word that wasn't hurtful.”</t989> <t990>“The possibility of harm.</t990><t991>”</t991>
<t992>•</t992> <t993>“Thank you, Mr. Boring GrammarExpert.” “Grammar,” I said.</t993>
<t994>"Ah Tannm, I will kill you!" But he was laughing.</t994>
<t995>I drove the car around Jefferson Park, so we could avoid passing by our houses, in case our parents had woken up and noticed we weren't home.</t995> <t996>We went along the lake (Jefferson Lake), then turned towards Jefferson Courthouse.</t996>
<t997>we went to the small, artificial center of Jefferson Park, which looked eerily deserted and silent.</t997> <t998>We found Lacey's black SUV parked in front of the sushi restaurant.</t998> <t999>We stopped a block away, in the first parking spot we found that wasn't under a streetlight.</t999>
<t1000>“Can you pass me the last fish?” Margo asked.</t1000> <t1001>I was glad to be rid of the fish because it had already started to smell.</t1001> <t1002>Then Margo wrote on the wrapping paper in her own handwriting: Friendship with ms is Sleeping with Fish We moved forward in zigzags around the circular glows of the street lamps, walking as ordinarily as two people could, one (Margo) holding a large fish wrapped in paper and the other (me) holding a can of blue spray paint.</t1002> <t1003>A dog barked and we both froze, but then it got quiet again and soon we arrived at Lacey's car.</t1003>
<t1004>“Well, this makes things even more difficult,” said Margo when she saw that the car was locked.</t1004> <t1005>She reached into her pocket and pulled out a piece of wire that was once a clothes hanger.</t1005> <t1006>It took her less than a minute to unlock the car.</t1006> <t1007>Of course, I was impressed.</t1007>
<t1008>As soon as the driver opened his door, he reached over and opened mine too.</t1008> <t1009>"Hey, help me lift the seat up," he whispered.</t1009> <t1010>Together, we lifted the back seat up.</t1010> <t1011>Margo shoved the fish under the seat, then counted to three, and in one swift motion, we lowered the seat onto the fish.</t1011> <t1012>I heard the disgusting sound of the catfish's internal organs bursting.</t1012> <t1013>I tried to imagine how Lacey's car would smell after just one day baking in the sun, and I confess, a kind of peace washed over me.</t1013> <t1014>Then Margo said, "Write an M on the ceiling for me."</t1014>
<t1015>I didn't need to think for even a second before nodding my head, I climbed onto the rear bumper, then bent down and quickly spray-painted a huge M across the roof.</t1015> <t1016>Normally, I was against vandalism.</t1016> <t1017>But normally, I was also against Lacey Pemberton...</t1017> <t1018>and after all, this proved to be a more deeply held belief.</t1018>
<t1019>It landed.</t1019> <t1020>I jumped out of the car.</t1020> <t1021>I ran along the block towards the minivan, taking quick and short breaths into the darkness.</t1021> <t1022>As I put my hand on the steering wheel, I noticed that my index finger was blue.</t1022> <t1023>I raised my finger for Margo to see.</t1023> <t1024>She smiled and extended her own blue finger, then our fingers touched, her blue finger softly pushing mine, and my pulse couldn't slow down.</t1024> <t1025>After a long while, Margo said, “Section Nine... downtown.”</t1025>
<t1026>It was 2:49 in the morning.</t1026> <t1027>I had never felt less tired in my entire life.</t1027>
<t1028>6</t1028>
<t1029>Tourists never go to downtown Orlando because there is nothing there except for a few skyscrapers belonging to banks and insurance companies.</t1029> <t1030>This is the kind of downtown that is completely deserted at night and on weekends, except for a few nightclubs half-filled with the desperate and the desperately boring.</t1030> <t1031>As I navigated through the labyrinth of one-way streets according to Margo's directions, we saw a few people sleeping on the sidewalk or sitting on benches, but no one was moving.</t1031> <t1032>Margo rolled down the window, and I felt the stale air blowing against my face, warmer than it should have been at night.</t1032> <t1033>When I looked at Margo, I saw strands of hair flying all over her face.</t1033> <t1034>Even though I could see Margo there, I felt completely alone among these big and empty buildings; as if I had survived the apocalypse and the world had been granted to me, as if this amazing and endless world was mine to explore.</t1034>
<t1035>“Are you just taking me for a ride?” I asked.</t1035>
<t1036>“No,” he said.</t1036> <t1037>“I am trying to reach the SunTrust building.</t1037> <t1038>Right next to Kuşkonmaz.</t1038><t1039>”</t1039>
<t1040>“Yes,” I said, because tonight I had received useful information for the first time.</t1040> <t1041>“It’s down south.”</t1041> <t1042>I drove a few more blocks and turned.</t1042> <t1043>Margo pointed happily with her hand and yes, Asparagus was right there, directly in front of us.</t1043>
<t1044>Technically, the asparagus is neither an asparagus shoot nor made up of asparagus parts.</t1044> <t1045>It's just a sculpture that bears a mysterious resemblance to a roughly nine-meter piece of asparagus...</t1045> <t1046>However, I had also heard that it resembles the following:</t1046>
<t1047>1.</t1047> <t1048>Beanstalk made of green glass</t1048>
<t1049>2.</t1049> <t1050>An abstract representation of a tree</t1050><t1051></t1051>
<t1052>3.</t1052> <t1053>A greener, more glassy, uglier Washington Monument</t1053>
<t1054>4.</t1054> <t1055>The cheerful green giant's cheerful green gigantic penis</t1055>
<t1056>In any case, it didn't look like the real name of the statue, which was Light Tower.</t1056> <t1057>I parked in front of a parking meter and looked at Margo.</t1057> <t1058>I caught her for a moment staring into the distance with blank eyes, not at Asparagus, but beyond it.</t1058> <t1059>This was the first moment I thought something might be wrong—not the "my boyfriend is a jerk" kind of wrong, but a real wrong.</t1059> <t1060>I should have said something.</t1060> <t1061>Undoubtedly, I should have said one thing after another and another, but I only said, "Can I ask why you brought me to Asparagus?"</t1061>
<t1062>She turned her head to me and smiled.</t1062> <t1063>Margo was so beautiful that even her fake smiles were convincing.</t1063> <t1064>"We need to check our progress.</t1064> <t1065>And the best place to do that is the top of the SunTrust building.</t1065><t1066>"</t1066>
<t1067>I rolled my eyes.</t1067> <t1068>“No.</t1068> <t1069>Absolutely not.</t1069> <t1070>You said no breaking and entering.</t1070><t1071>”</t1071>
<t1072>"This is not a home invasion.</t1072> <t1073>We are just going to enter because it is an unlocked door.</t1073><t1074>"</t1074>
<t1075>“Margo, this is so ridiculous.</t1075> <t1076>Of course...</t1076><t1077>”</t1077>
<t1078>“I admit, throughout the night we entered different households without permission.</t1078> <t1079>We entered Becca's house without permission.</t1079> <t1080>We entered Jase's house without permission.</t1080> <t1081>Here, we will just enter.</t1081> <t1082>None of these fully count as trespassing.</t1082> <t1083>In theory, the police could charge us with unauthorized entry.</t1083>
<t1084>They can accuse us, but they cannot charge us with trespassing.</t1084> <t1085>So, I kept my word.</t1085><t1086>”</t1086>
<t1087>“Surely, there must be a security guard or something at the SunTrust building,” I said.</t1087>
<t1088>“Yes,” he said, unbuckling his seatbelt.</t1088> <t1089>“Of course there is.</t1089> <t1090>His name is Gus.”</t1090>
<t1091>We walked in through the door.</t1091> <t1092>Behind a wide, circular table, a young man with a thin goatee, wearing a Regents Security uniform, was sitting.</t1092> <t1093>"How are you, Margo?" he said.</t1093>
<t1094>“Hi Gus,” Margo replied.</t1094>
<t1095>"Who is the child?"</t1095><t1096>"</t1096>
<t1097>I wanted to shout, "WE'RE THE SAME AGE!" but I let Margo speak for me.</t1097> <t1098>“This is my coworker, Q.</t1098> <t1099>Q, this is Gus.</t1099><t1100>”</t1100>
<t1101>"How are you, Q?" asked Gus.</t1101>
<t1102>Ah, we're just wandering around the city distributing dead fish, breaking windows, taking photos of naked men, hanging out in skyscraper lobbies at three-thirty in the morning, things like that.</t1102> <t1103>"Not much," I replied.</t1103>
<t1104>“The elevators are not working tonight,” said Gus.</t1104> <t1105>“I had to shut them down at three o'clock.</t1105> <t1106>Still, please go ahead and use the stairs.” “Very well.</t1106> <t1107>See you, Gus.</t1107><t1108>”</t1108>
<t1109>"See you, Margo."</t1109><t1110>"</t1110>
<t1111>“For God's sake, how do you know the security guard at the SunTrust building?” I asked as soon as we reached the stairs.</t1111>
<t1112>“When we were in the first grade, he was in the final grade,” she replied.</t1112> <t1113>“We need to hurry, okay?</t1113> <t1114>Time is passing.”</t1114> <t1115>Margo started climbing the stairs two at a time, one arm flying up the banister, and I tried to keep up with her but couldn't.</t1115> <t1116>Margo didn't do any sports, but she loved to run...</t1116> <t1117>Her</t1117>
<t1118>I had seen him a few times running in Jefferson Park, listening to music alone.</t1118> <t1119>However, I did not like running or even engaging in any physical effort.</t1119> <t1120>But now, I was trying to keep up with him steadily, wiping the sweat from my forehead and ignoring the burning in my legs.</t1120> <t1121>When I reached the twenty-fifth floor, Margo was standing on the landing, waiting for me.</t1121>
<t1122>“Take a look at this,” he said.</t1122> <t1123>He opened the door next to the stairs and we entered a huge room with an oak table as long as two cars and a long side surrounded by floor-to-ceiling windows.</t1123> <t1124>“Conference room,” he said.</t1124> <t1125>“It has the best view in the entire building.”</t1125> <t1126>I followed him as he walked by the windows.</t1126> <t1127>“Alright, there it is,” he said, pointing with his hand.</t1127> <t1128>“Jefferson Park.</t1128> <t1129>Do you see our houses?</t1129> <t1130>The lights are still off, that's good.”</t1130> <t1131>He took a few steps to the side.</t1131> <t1132>“Jase’s house.</t1132> <t1133>The lights are off, no more police cars.</t1133> <t1134>Perfect, but unfortunately, this might also mean that Jase has arrived home.” Becca’s house was too far to be seen, even from here.</t1134>
<t1135>Margo remained silent for a short while, then approached the very edge of the window and rested her forehead against it.</t1135> <t1136>I stayed behind, but she grabbed my t-shirt and pulled me forward.</t1136> <t1137>I didn't want to put our combined weight on a single window, but she kept pulling me, and I could feel her clenched fist beside me. Finally, I slowly placed my head against the window and looked around.</t1137>
<t1138>From above, Orlando appeared to be quite well-lit.</t1138> <t1139>Below us, I could see the flashing DO NOT CROSS signs at the intersections, the streetlights enveloping the entire city like a perfect mesh, until the city center ended and the winding and dead-end streets of Orlando's vast suburbs began.</t1139>
<t1140>"Very beautiful," I said.</t1140>
<t1141>Margo pursed her lips.</t1141> <t1142>"Really?</t1142> <t1143>Do you seriously think that way?</t1143><t1144>"</t1144>
<t1145>"Well, okay, maybe it's not like that," I said, even though it actually was.</t1145> <t1146>When I saw Orlando from a plane, it looked like a green ocean to me.</t1146>
<t1147>It looked like a sunken LEGO set.</t1147> <t1148>From here, at night, it looked like a real place but one I was seeing for the first time.</t1148> <t1149>While walking in the conference room and the other offices on that floor, I could see everything.</t1149> <t1150>The school was there.</t1150> <t1151>Jefferson Park was there.</t1151> <t1152>Disney World was in the distance.</t1152> <t1153>Wet ’n Wild was there.</t1153> <t1154>The 7Eleven where Margo painted her nails and I struggled to breathe was there.</t1154> <t1155>Here they all were...</t1155> <t1156>my whole world.</t1156> <t1157>And I could see it just by walking inside a building.</t1157> <t1158>“More impressive,” I said out loud.</t1158> <t1159>“From a distance, I mean.</t1159> <t1160>You can't see the wear and tear on them, if you know what I mean.</t1160> <t1161>You can't see the rust, the weeds, or the paint cracking.</t1161> <t1162>You see this place as someone once imagined it.</t1162><t1163>”</t1163>
<t1164>“Everything is uglier up close,” he said.</t1164>
<t1165>"It's not you," I said, without thinking properly.</t1165>
<t1166>With her forehead still pressed against the window, she turned to me and smiled.</t1166> <t1167>"Here's a piece of advice: You're charming when you're confident.</t1167> <t1168>When you're not confident, you're less charming."</t1168> <t1169>Before I could say anything, she turned back to the view and started talking: "The thing that's not beautiful here is this: You can't see the rust, the cracked paint from here, but you understand what this place really is.</t1169> <t1170>You see how everything is fake.</t1170> <t1171>It's not even as sturdy as something made of plastic.</t1171> <t1172>A city made of paper.</t1172> <t1173>So look at this, Q, look at all these dead-end streets, the roads that lead to the same place, all these houses built to fall apart.</t1173> <t1174>All these paper people living in their paper houses, burning the future to keep themselves warm.</t1174> <t1175>All the paper children drinking the beer that some thug got for them from a paper kiosk.</t1175> <t1176>Everyone is losing themselves in the madness of owning things.</t1176> <t1177>All these things are paper-thin and paper-fragile.</t1177> <t1178>And so are all the people.</t1178> <t1179>I've been living here for eighteen years and I've never once met a single person who cared about something truly important in my life.</t1179><t1180>"</t1180>
<t1181>“I will try not to take it personally,” I said, as we both stared into the ink-like darkness, dead-end streets, and quarter-acre gardens.</t1181> <t1182>But Margo's shoulder was leaning against my arm, and the tops of our hands were touching; even though I wasn't looking at Margo, leaning against the window felt almost like leaning against her.</t1182>
<t1183>“I'm sorry,” he said.</t1183> <t1184>“If I had been hanging out with you all this time, maybe everything would have been different for me...</t1184> <t1185>Oh, God.</t1185> <t1186>I even hate myself for caring about my so-called friends.</t1186> <t1187>So it's not like ‘oh, I'm so upset because of Jason’ or anything.</t1187> <t1188>Or because of Becca.</t1188> <t1189>Not even because of Lacey...</t1189> <t1190>though I did love her.</t1190> <t1191>But this was the last remaining thread.</t1191> <t1192>It was definitely an insignificant thread, but it was the last thread, and every paper girl needs at least one thread, right?</t1192><t1193>”</t1193>
<t1194>And I said this.</t1194> <t1195>I said: 'Yann, you are welcome to join us at our table for lunch.'</t1195><t1196>"</t1196>
<t1197>“You are very sweet,” he replied as his voice gradually faded.</t1197> <t1198>He turned to me and slowly nodded his head.</t1198> <t1199>I smiled.</t1199> <t1200>He smiled.</t1200> <t1201>I believed in his smile.</t1201> <t1202>We walked to the stairs and then ran down.</t1202> <t1203>At the end of each floor, I jumped off the last step and clicked my heels to make him laugh, and he laughed.</t1203> <t1204>I thought I was cheering him up.</t1204> <t1205>I thought he could be cheered up.</t1205> <t1206>I thought that if I had confidence in myself, maybe something could happen between us.</t1206>
<t1207>I was mistaken.</t1207>
<t1208>While sitting in the minivan with the keys in the ignition but the engine not yet running, Margo asked, "By the way, what time do your parents get up?"</t1208>
<t1209>“I don't know, around a quarter past six.” It was 03:51.</t1209> <t1210>“So, we have two or more hours and we have finished nine sections.</t1210><t1211>”</t1211>
<t1212>“I know, but I saved the most difficult one for last.</t1212> <t1213>Anyway, we will complete them all.</t1213> <t1214>Chapter Ten...</t1214> <t1215>It's Q's turn to choose a victim.</t1215><t1216>”</t1216>
<t1217>“What?</t1217><t1218>”</t1218>
<t1219>“I have already chosen a punishment.</t1219> <t1220>Now you just choose upon whom we shall unleash our mighty wrath.</t1220><t1221>”</t1221>
<t1222>“Whom we shall rain our mighty wrath upon,” I corrected, as she shook her head with a grimace.</t1222> <t1223>“There really isn’t anyone upon whom I shall rain my wrath,” I said, because there truly wasn’t.</t1223> <t1224>It always seemed to me that to have enemies, one must be someone important.</t1224> <t1225>For example: Historically, Germany had more enemies than Luxembourg.</t1225> <t1226>Margo Roth Spiegelman was Germany.</t1226> <t1227>And Great Britain.</t1227> <t1228>And the United States.</t1228> <t1229>And Tsarist Russia.</t1229> <t1230>And I was Luxembourg.</t1230> <t1231>Just sitting idly, keeping an eye on the sheep and singing folk songs.</t1231>
<t1232>“What do you say to Chuck?” he asked.</t1232>
<t1233>“Hmm,” I said.</t1233> <t1234>Chuck Parson was quite terrifying all those years before he was reined in.</t1234> <t1235>The conveyor belt in the cafeteria</t1235>
<t1236>Aside from the disaster, one time he caught me waiting for the bus outside of school, twisted my arm, and kept saying, "Say you're a fag."</t1236> <t1237>That was his whole purpose, a "I have a twelve-word vocabulary, so don't expect a wide variety of insults" type of insult.</t1237> <t1238>And even though it was terribly childish, I eventually had to say that I was a fag, and it really bothered me because 1.</t1238> <t1239>Leaving me aside, I think that word should absolutely not be used by anyone, 2.</t1239> <t1240>As can be seen, I am not gay, and furthermore 3.</t1240> <t1241>Even though there's nothing wrong with being gay, Chuck Parson acted as if saying you're a fag was the biggest insult in the world, and while he was twisting my arm more and more towards my shoulder blade, I tried to say this, and he just kept saying, "If you're so proud of being a fag, why don't you admit you're a fag, fag?"</t1241>
<t1242>When it came to logic, there was no doubt that Chuck Parson was no Aristotle.</t1242> <t1243>But he was about two meters tall and weighed one hundred and twenty kilos, which was a noteworthy feature.</t1243>
<t1244>“It is possible to find really good reasons against Chuck,” I admitted.</t1244> <t1245>Then I started the car and set off again towards the interstate road.</t1245> <t1246>I didn't know where we were going, but we weren't staying in the damn city center.</t1246>
<t1247>"Do you remember the Crown Dance School?" he asked.</t1247> <t1248>"I was thinking about it tonight.</t1248><t1249>"</t1249>
<t1250>“Ah.</t1250> <t1251>Yes.</t1251><t1252>”</t1252>
<t1253>“I am sorry about this, by the way.</t1253> <t1254>I have no idea why I accompanied him.</t1254><t1255>”</t1255>
<t1256>“Yes.</t1256> <t1257>It's not important at all,” I said, but remembering the damn Crown Dance School made me angry.</t1257> <t1258>“Yes.</t1258> <t1259>Chuck Parson.</t1259> <t1260>Do you know where he lives?” I asked.</t1260>
<t1261>“I knew I could bring out your kinder side.</t1261> <t1262>In College Park.</t1262> <t1263>Leave Princeton.”</t1263> <t1264>I turned onto the ramp at the interstate entrance and floored the gas pedal.</t1264> <t1265>“Whoa,” said Margo.</t1265> <t1266>“Don’t break the Chrysler.</t1266><t1267>”</t1267>
<t1268>In sixth grade, a group of kids including Margo, Chuck, and me were forced by our parents to take ballroom dance lessons at the Crown School of Humiliation, Degradation, and Dance.</t1268> <t1269>This is how it worked: The boys stood on one side, the girls on the other, and then when the teacher told us, the boys would go over to the girls and ask, 'Would you do me the honor of this dance?' and the girls would say, 'Of course.'</t1269> <t1270>The girls were not allowed to say no.</t1270> <t1271>But one day, while we were doing the foxtrot, Chuck Parson convinced all the girls to say no to me.</t1271> <t1272>Not to anyone else.</t1272> <t1273>Just to me.</t1273> <t1274>So I walked over to Mary Beth Shortz and asked, 'Would you do me the honor of this dance?' and she said no.</t1274> <t1275>Then I asked another girl, then another, then Margo who also said no, then another, and then I started to cry.</t1275>
<t1276>The only thing worse than being rejected at dance school is crying because you were rejected at dance school, and the only thing worse than that is going to the dance teacher and, through your tears, saying, "The girls are saying no to me but they shouldn't beee,"</t1276> <t1277>So of course, I went to the teacher crying and spent most of middle school trying to forget this embarrassing incident.</t1277> <t1278>In short, Chuck Parson had forever prevented me, a sixth grader, from doing the foxtrot, which didn't even seem particularly terrible.</t1278> <t1279>I wasn't really angry about this incident anymore...</t1279> <t1280>or about everything else he had done to me over the years.</t1280> <t1281>But I definitely wasn't going to feel sorry for Chuck's suffering.</t1281>
<t1282>“Wait, they won't know it's me, right?</t1282><t1283>”</t1283>
<t1284>'Hey.</t1284> <t1285>Why?</t1285><t1286>"</t1286>
<t1287>“I don't want him to think I care enough to hurt him.”</t1287> <t1288>I placed one hand on the center console and Margo lightly tapped it.</t1288> <t1289>“Don't worry,” she said.</t1289> <t1290>“He'll never know who plucked his feathers.</t1290><t1291>”</t1291>
<t1292>"I think you just used a term incorrectly, but I don't know what it means either."</t1292><t1293></t1293>
<t1294>"I know a word you don't know," said Margo in a melodious voice.</t1294> <t1295>"I AM THE NEW QUEEN OF VOCABULARY! I HAVE USURPED YOUR PLACE!</t1295><t1296>"</t1296>
<t1297>“Spell out the word 'gasbetmek',” I said.</t1297>
<t1298>“No,” she replied, laughing.</t1298> <t1299>“I will not give up my crown in exchange for being robbed.</t1299> <t1300>You must do better.</t1300><t1301>”</t1301>
<t1302>“Okay.” I smiled.</t1302>
<t1303>Since most of the houses were built thirty years ago, we proceeded towards College Park, the neighborhood considered Orlando's historic district.</t1303> <t1304>Margo couldn't remember Chuck's exact address, what his house looked like, or even exactly which street he lived on ("I'm almost ninety-five percent sure it's on Vassar."). Finally, after the Chrysler circled three blocks on Vassar Street, Margo pointed to the left and said, "There it is."</t1304>
<t1305>"Are you sure?" I asked.</t1305>
<t1306>“I am like ninety-seven point two percent sure.</t1306> <t1307>I mean, I am quite sure that the bedroom is right here,” he said, gesturing with his hand.</t1307> <t1308>“Once, he threw a party and when the police came, I escaped through his window.</t1308> <t1309>I am quite sure this is the same window.” “It looks like we might be getting into trouble.</t1309><t1310>”</t1310>
<t1311>“But if the window is open, there won't be any trespassing involved.</t1311> <t1312>We'll just enter the house.</t1312> <t1313>And we just performed an entry action at SunTrust a moment ago, and it wasn't a big deal, right?”</t1313> <t1314>I laughed.</t1314> <t1315>“I think you're turning me into a tough kid.</t1315><t1316>”</t1316>
<t1317>“That's the goal.</t1317> <t1318>Alright, the materials: Get the Veet, spray paint, and Vaseline.</t1318><t1319>”</t1319>
<t1320>"Okay." I got what they said.</t1320>
<t1321>“Now don't lose yourself, Q. The good news is that Chuck is sleeping like a bear in hibernation...</t1321> <t1322>I know because I took a literature class with him last year and even when Ms. Johnston hit him with Jane Eyre, he didn't wake up.</t1322> <t1323>So we’re going to climb up to his bedroom window, open the window, take off our shoes, then very quietly go inside and I’m going to have some fun with Chuck.</t1323> <t1324>Then we’ll go to different parts of the house and cover all the doorknobs with Vaseline, so even if someone wakes up, they’ll have a terribly hard time catching us while trying to get out of the house.</t1324> <t1325>Then we’ll have some more fun with Chuck, paint his house a bit, and get out of there.</t1325> <t1326>And no talking.</t1326><t1327>”</t1327>
<t1328>I placed my hand on my jugular vein, but I was smiling.</t1328>
<t1329>When Margo reached out and intertwined her fingers with mine, we were walking away from the car together.</t1329> <t1330>I squeezed hers and looked at her.</t1330> <t1331>She nodded seriously, I nodded back, and then she let go of my hand.</t1331> <t1332>We quickly climbed out the window.</t1332> <t1333>I gently pushed the wooden frame up.</t1333> <t1334>It creaked very little but opened in one motion.</t1334> <t1335>I looked inside.</t1335> <t1336>It was dark, but I could see someone in the bed.</t1336>
<t1337>The window was a bit high for Margo, so I clasped my hands together, Margo stepped on my hand with her socked foot, and I pushed her up.</t1337> <t1338>Her silent entry into the house would make a ninja envious.</t1338> <t1339>As for me, I tried to jump up and get my head and shoulders to the window, attempting to enter the house by performing a complex body undulation, dancing like a caterpillar.</t1339> <t1340>Everything might have gone well, except my groin got caught on the window sill and I groaned in pain, which was quite a big mistake.</t1340>
<t1341>A bedside lamp turned on.</t1341> <t1342>And there, lying in bed, was an old man...</t1342> <t1343>it was clearly not Chuck Parson.</t1343> <t1344>His eyes were wide with terror; he said nothing.</t1344>
<t1345>“Hmm,” said Margo.</t1345> <t1346>I thought about running away and dashing to the car, but I stayed there for Margo's sake, with the upper part of my body parallel to the ground inside the house.</t1346> <t1347>“Hmm, I think we’re in the wrong house.”</t1347> <t1348>She turned back and looked at me insistently, and only then did I realize I was blocking Margo's exit.</t1348> <t1349>So I pushed myself out of the window, grabbed my shoes, and made a run for it.</t1349>
<t1350>We drove to the other side of College Park to plan everything again.</t1350>
<t1351>"I think we're sharing the blame this time," said Margo.</t1351>
<t1352>“Hmm, you chose the wrong house,” I said.</t1352>
<t1353>‘True, but you are the one making noise.”</t1353> <t1354>We stayed silent for a minute, driving in circles, then I finally spoke: ‘We can probably find Chuck's address on the internet.</t1354> <t1355>Radar can connect to the school's system.</t1355><t1356>”</t1356>
<t1357>“Great,” said Margo.</t1357>
<t1358>Then I called Radar, but the phone directed me to voicemail.</t1358> <t1359>I intended to call his house, but his parents were friends with mine, so that wouldn’t work.</t1359> <t1360>Finally, I thought of calling Ben.</t1360> <t1361>He wasn’t Radar, but he knew all of Radar’s passwords.</t1361> <t1362>I called.</t1362> <t1363>I was directed to voicemail, but only after the phone rang.</t1363> <t1364>So I called again.</t1364> <t1365>Voicemail.</t1365> <t1366>I called again.</t1366> <t1367>Voicemail.</t1367> <t1368>Margo said, “Clearly, he’s not going to answer,” as I dialed the number again.</t1368> <t1369>“Oh, he will,” I said.</t1369> <t1370>And he answered after just four more calls.</t1370>
<t1371>“You better be calling to say that you have eleven naked bunnies at home and that they only want the Special Feeling that only Daddy Ben can provide.</t1371><t1372>”</t1372>
<t1373>"You need to use Radar's student system login password to check an address."</t1373> <t1374>Chuck Parson.</t1374><t1375>"</t1375>
<t1376>“No.</t1376><t1377>”</t1377>
<t1378>“Please,” I said.</t1378>
<t1379>“No.</t1379><t1380>”</t1380>
<t1381>“You will be glad you did this, Ben.</t1381> <t1382>I promise.</t1382><t1383>”</t1383>
<t1384>“Yes, yes, I just did it.</t1384> <t1385>I was doing it while saying no, I have no choice but to help.</t1385> <t1386>422 Amherst.</t1386> <t1387>Hey, why are you asking for Chuck Parson’s address at four-thirty in the morning?</t1387><t1388>”</t1388>
<t1389>“Get some sleep, Benners.</t1389><t1390>”</t1390>
<t1391>“I will assume this is a dream,” answered Ben and hung up the phone.</t1391>
<t1392>Amherst was just a few blocks away.</t1392> <t1393>We parked in front of number 418, gathered our supplies, and ran across the lawn of Chuck's house, the morning dew on the grass soaking my pants.</t1393>
<t1394>I quietly climbed through Chuck's window, which was thankfully lower than that of the Random Old Man, and pulled Margo up first, then inside.</t1394> <t1395>Chuck Parson was sleeping on his back.</t1395> <t1396>Margo tiptoed towards him, and I stood behind her, my heart pounding.</t1396> <t1397>If he woke up, he would kill us both.</t1397> <t1398>Margo took out the Veet, squeezed some of the stuff that looked like shaving cream into her palm, and then gently and carefully applied it to Chuck's right eyebrow.</t1398> <t1399>Chuck didn't even move.</t1399>
<t1400>Then she opened the petroleum jelly...</t1400> <t1401>The lid made a plop sound loud enough to deafen ears, but Chuck still showed no sign of waking up.</t1401> <t1402>Margo poured the petroleum jelly into my hand, then we went towards different parts of the house.</t1402> <t1403>First, I went to the entrance and generously applied the petroleum jelly to the front door handle, then I went to an open bedroom door and applied the jelly to the inside handle, closing the door quietly with only a faint creak.</t1403>
<t1404>Finally, I returned to Chuck's room. Margo had already arrived, and together we closed Chuck's door and smeared vaseline on the doorknob.</t1404>
<t1405>We generously applied petroleum jelly all over the window in the bedroom, hoping that it would make it harder to open the window after closing it when going outside.</t1405>
<t1406>Margo glanced at her watch and raised two fingers.</t1406> <t1407>We waited.</t1407> <t1408>During those two minutes, we just stared into each other's eyes, and I watched the blueness in her eyes.</t1408> <t1409>It was very nice...</t1409> <t1410>darkness and silence, without the possibility of me saying something that would ruin everything.</t1410> <t1411>And her eyes were looking at me too, as if there was something worth seeing in me.</t1411>
<t1412>Margo nodded at that moment, and I approached Chuck.</t1412><t1413>I wrapped my hand in my t-shirt, leaned forward as Margo had told me, and as quietly as I could, pressed my finger against Chuck’s eyebrow and quickly pulled the Veet.</t1413><t1414>All the hairs on Chuck Parson’s right eyebrow came off one by one with it.</t1414><t1415>When Chuck’s eyes opened, I was standing over him with his right eyebrow on my t-shirt.</t1415><t1416>Margo threw the blanket at Chuck with lightning speed, and when I looked up, the little ninja was already out the window.</t1416><t1417>As Chuck screamed, “MOM! DAD! THIEF! THIEF!”, I followed him as fast as I could.</t1417>
<t1418>The only thing we stole was itchy, I wanted to say, but with my feet first, while I was dangling myself out of the window, I didn't even open my mouth.</t1418> <t1419>I landed right next to Margo, who had spray-painted an M on the facade of Chuck's house, then we both grabbed our shoes and bolted to the car.</t1419> <t1420>When I turned back to look at the house, the lights were on but no one had come out yet, a testament to the clever simplicity of the well-vaselined doorknob.</t1420> <t1421>By the time Mr. (or maybe Mrs., I hadn't seen clearly) Parson opened the living room curtains and looked out, we were already backing the car onto Princeton Avenue and heading back to the interstate.</t1421>
<t1422>“Yes!” I shouted.</t1422> <t1423>“My God, that was amazing.</t1423><t1424>”</t1424>
<t1425>"Did you see?"</t1425> <t1426>"I mean, his eyebrowless face."</t1426> <t1427>"He will constantly be looking indecisively."</t1427> <t1428>"Oh, really?</t1428> <t1429>I only had one eyebrow."</t1429>
<t1430>Are you saying that?</t1430> <t1431>You might be right,’ something like that.</t1431> <t1432>And the idea of making that jerk choose is great: Should he shave the left side too, or paint the right side?</t1432> <t1433>Oh, really great.</t1433> <t1434>How he called for his mom, the little brat.</t1434><t1435>”</t1435>
<t1436>“One second, why do you hate him?</t1436><t1437>”</t1437>
<t1438>“I didn't say that I hated him.</t1438> <t1439>I said he was a little jerk.</t1439><t1440>”</t1440>
<t1441>"But you were always kind of friends with him," I said, or at least that's what I thought.</t1441>
<t1442>“Well, um, I was always kind of friends with a lot of people,” he said.</t1442> <t1443>He leaned in and put his head on my skinny shoulder, his hair falling onto my neck.</t1443> <t1444>“I’m tired,” he said.</t1444>
<t1445>“Caffeine,” I said.</t1445> <t1446>He reached back and grabbed a Mountain Dew for each of us, I drank mine in two big gulps.</t1446>
<t1447>“Now we are going to SeaWorld,” he said.</t1447> <t1448>“Chapter Eleven.</t1448><t1449>”</t1449>
<t1450>“So, are we going to set Willy free or something?</t1450><t1451>”</t1451>
<t1452>“No,” he said.</t1452> <t1453>“We’re just going to SeaWorld, that’s all.</t1453> <t1454>That’s the only amusement park I haven’t snuck into yet.</t1454><t1455>”</t1455>
<t1456>"We can't enter SeaWorld without permission," I said and pulled into the empty parking lot of the furniture store, stopping the car.</t1456>
<t1457>"We are a bit pressed for time," he said to me, then reached out to start the car.</t1457>
<t1458>I pushed his hand aside.</t1458> <t1459>“We can't enter SeaWorld without permission,” I repeated.</t1459>
<t1460>“Well, here we go again with the breaking and entering issue.”</t1460> <t1461>Margo paused and opened another Mountain Dew.</t1461> <t1462>The light reflected off the can onto her face, and for a second, I could see that she was smiling about what she was about to say.</t1462> <t1463>“There’s no breaking and entering.</t1463> <t1464>Don’t think of it as sneaking into SeaWorld.</t1464> <t1465>Think of it as getting a free tour of SeaWorld at midnight.</t1465><t1466>”</t1466>
<t1467>8</t1467>
<t1468>“Well, first of all, we are going to get caught,” I said.</t1468> <t1469>I hadn't started the car, I was listing the reasons why I hadn't started it, and I was wondering if he could see me or not.</t1469>
<t1470>“Of course, we will be caught.</t1470> <t1471>So what?</t1471><t1472>”</t1472>
<t1473>“This is illegal.</t1473><t1474>”</t1474>
<t1475>“Q, what kind of trouble can SeaVVorld get you into?</t1475> <t1476>I mean, God, after all the things I've done for you tonight, can't you do just one thing for me?</t1476> <t1477>Can't you just shut up, calm down, and not freak out at every damn little adventure?”</t1477> <t1478>Then in a low voice, “I mean, God.</t1478> <t1479>Be a little brave,” he said.</t1479>
<t1480>So I got angry because of this.</t1480> <t1481>I ducked my head under the seatbelt so I could lean towards the other side of the console, towards Margo.</t1481> <t1482>“After all the things YOU did for ME, is that so?” I said, almost shouting.</t1482> <t1483>Did she want confidence?</t1483> <t1484>Well, I was confident.</t1484> <t1485>“So that no one would understand what I was looking for, did YOU call MY friend’s father who was screwing MY girlfriend?</t1485> <t1486>Did YOU drive ME around the world not because I was ‘so precious’ to you, but because I needed a car and you were nearby?</t1486> <t1487>Are these the kinds of things you did for me tonight?</t1487><t1488>’</t1488>
<t1489>He wasn't looking at me.</t1489> <t1490>He was just staring straight ahead, looking at the front of the furniture store.</t1490> <t1491>"Do you think I need you?</t1491> <t1492>I can get the safe from under my parents' bed</t1492>
<t1493>Don't you think I can give Myrna Mountweazel Benadryl to make her sleep?</t1493> <t1494>Or sneak into your room while you're asleep and take your car keys?</t1494> <t1495>I didn't need you, you fool.</t1495> <t1496>I chose you.</t1496> <t1497>Then you chose me too.</t1497> <t1498>At that moment, she looked at me.</t1498> <t1499>“And that's like some kind of promise.</t1499> <t1500>At least for tonight.</t1500> <t1501>In sickness and in health.</t1501> <t1502>In good times and in bad.</t1502> <t1503>In wealth and in poverty.</t1503> <t1504>Until dawn separates us.</t1504><t1505>”</t1505>
<t1506>I started the car and pulled out of the parking spot, but despite all that teamwork nonsense, I still felt like I was being forced into something with my head being chewed off, and I wanted to have the final say.</t1506> <t1507>“Fine.</t1507> <t1508>But SeaWorld or whatever, Duke University is going to be really mad when they get a letter saying that cruel Quentin Jacobsen, along with a wild-eyed girl, broke into their facilities at four in the morning.</t1508> <t1509>My parents are going to be really mad too.</t1509><t1510>”</t1510>
<t1511>“Q, you will go to Duke.</t1511> <t1512>You will become a very successful lawyer, you will get married, you will have children, you will live that whole little life, then you will die and in your last moments, while choking on your own bile in a nursing home, you will say to yourself: Maybe, I might have wasted my entire damn life, but at least in my senior year of high school, I broke into SeaWorld with Margo Roth Spiegelman.</t1512> <t1513>At least I carpe'd one diem.</t1513><t1514>”’</t1514>
<t1515>“Noctem,” I corrected.</t1515>
<t1516>‘Alright, you are the Grammar King again.</t1516> <t1517>You have regained my throne.</t1517> <t1518>Now take me to SeaWorld.</t1518><t1519>”</t1519>
<t1520>As I quietly advanced on I-4, I found myself thinking about the day the man in the gray suit died.</t1520> <t1521>Maybe this is why Margo chose me, I thought.</t1521> <t1522>At that very moment, I finally remembered what Margo had said about the dead man and the ropes...</t1522> <t1523>and also what she had said about herself and the ropes.</t1523>
<t1524>“Margo,” I said, breaking our silence.</t1524>
<t1525>“Q,” he said.</t1525>
<t1526>"You said...</t1526> <t1527>When a person dies, perhaps all the strings inside them have snapped, you said, and then you just said this for yourself as well, that the last string has snapped.</t1527><t1528>"</t1528>
<t1529>She was smiling.</t1529> <t1530>“You worry too much.</t1530> <t1531>I don’t want a few kids to find me in Jefferson Park on a Saturday morning with flies swarming over me.”</t1531> <t1532>She waited a moment before stating the crucial point.</t1532> <t1533>“I’m too flamboyant for that fate.</t1533><t1534>”</t1534>
<t1535>I laughed, relaxed, and exited the interstate.</t1535> <t1536>We turned onto International Boulevard, the world's tourism capital.</t1536> <t1537>There were thousands of shops on International Boulevard, and they all sold exactly the same thing: junk.</t1537> <t1538>Junk shaped like seashells, keychains, glass turtles, refrigerator magnets in the shape of Florida, pink plastic flamingos, you name it.</t1538> <t1539>In fact, there were even shops on International Boulevard that sold real armadillo poop...</t1539> <t1540>for $4.95 a bag.</t1540>
<t1541>But in the morning (MACMe the tourists were sleeping.</t1541> <t1542>As we passed one shop and parking lot after another, the boulevard was completely dead, like everything else.</t1542>
<t1543>“SeaWorld is right after you pass the tree-lined boulevard,” said Margo.</t1543> <t1544>She was in the back of the minivan again, rummaging through a backpack or something like that.</t1544> <t1545>“I had taken all the satellite maps and drawn up our attack plan, but I just can't seem to find the damn things.</t1545> <t1546>Anyway, turn right at the boulevard, there will be a souvenir shop on your left.</t1546><t1547>”</t1547>
<t1548>“There are approximately seventeen thousand souvenir shops in my town.</t1548><t1549>”</t1549>
<t1550>“That's true, but after the boulevard, there will be only one.</t1550><t1551>”</t1551>
<t1552>Indeed, there was only one, so I pulled into the empty parking space and parked the car directly under a street lamp, because cars were not constantly being stolen on the Boulevard.</t1552> <t1553>But the truth</t1553>
<t1554>Even if a masochistic car thief were to consider stealing the Chrysler, I still didn't relish the thought of explaining to my mother why and how the car disappeared in the late hours of a night before a school day.</t1554>
<t1555>We stood outside leaning against the back of the minivan, the air was so warm and dense that I felt my clothes sticking to me.</t1555> <t1556>I started to feel scared again, as if unseen people were watching me.</t1556> <t1557>It had been very dark for a long time and my stomach ached from the anxious hours.</t1557> <t1558>Margo found the maps and under the streetlamp's light, her spray-painted blue finger traced our route.</t1558> <t1559>"I think there's a fence right here," she said, pointing to a wooden spot we encountered just after crossing the boulevard.</t1559> <t1560>"I read something about this place on the internet.</t1560> <t1561>A drunk man decided to enter the park in the middle of the night and swim with Shamu, and the animal killed him.</t1561><t1562>"</t1562>
<t1563>“Really?</t1563><t1564>”</t1564>
<t1565>"Yes, I mean if that guy can do it while he's drunk, we can definitely do it while we're sober.</t1565> <t1566>After all, we are ninjas.</t1566><t1567>"</t1567>
<t1568>“Well, maybe you're a ninja,” I said.</t1568>
<t1569>“You’re just a really noisy, clumsy ninja,” said Margo, “but we’re both ninjas.”</t1569> <t1570>She tucked her hair behind her ears; pulled her hood over her head and tightened it with a rustle; the street lamp illuminated the sharp features of her pale face.</t1570> <t1571>Maybe we were both ninjas, but she was the only one with equipment.</t1571>
<t1572>‘Okay,’ he said.</t1572> <t1573>‘Memorize the map.’ The most terrifying part by far of the roughly one-kilometer journey Margo had planned for us was the ditch.</t1573> <t1574>SeaWorld was triangular in shape.</t1574> <t1575>One side, according to Margo's estimation, was guarded by a street patrolled by night watchmen, the second side was watched over by a lake with a circumference of at least one kilometer, and the third side had a drainage channel; on the map, it appeared to be about two lanes wide.</t1575>
<t1576>It looked as wide as a road.</t1576> <t1577>And in Florida, if there are drainage canals filled with water near the lakes, there are usually alligators there.</t1577>
<t1578>Margo grabbed me by both shoulders and turned me towards her.</t1578> <t1579>“We will probably get caught, and when we do, let me do the talking.</t1579> <t1580>You just need to look cute and display that weirdly innocent yet confident demeanor of yours, and everything will be fine.</t1580><t1581>”</t1581>
<t1582>I locked the car, tried to smooth down my frizzy hair, and whispered, "I am a ninja."</t1582> <t1583>I hadn't intended for Margo to hear, but she suddenly responded.</t1583> <t1584>"You definitely are!</t1584> <t1585>Now let's go."</t1585> <t1586>We ran to the other side of the boulevard, then lay in ambush in the greenery made up of long bushes and oaks.</t1586> <t1587>I had started to worry about poison ivy, but since ninjas wouldn't worry about poison ivy, I led the way towards the ditch, arms forward, pushing aside thorny bushes and shrubs.</t1587> <t1588>Finally, the trees ended and the clearing emerged, allowing me to see the boulevard to my right and the ditch directly in front of us.</t1588> <t1589>If there had been a few cars, people could have seen us from the road, but there were no cars at all.</t1589> <t1590>We moved to run through the greenery together and then made a sharp turn towards the boulevard.</t1590> <t1591>Margo said, "Now, now!" and I dashed across the six lanes of the main road.</t1591> <t1592>Even though the road was empty, there was something both thrilling and wrong about running across such a big street.</t1592>
<t1593>We managed to cross over and collapsed into the grass that stretched knee-high next to the boulevard.</t1593> <t1594>Margo pointed to the row of trees between SeaWorld's vast, enormous parking area and the dark, still water in the ditch.</t1594> <t1595>We ran along this row of trees for a minute, then Margo pulled me by the back of my shirt and quietly said, "Now into the ditch."</t1595>
<t1596>"Ladies first," I said.</t1596>
<t1597>"No, really."</t1597> <t1598>"I won't keep you," he replied.</t1598>
<t1599>And I didn't think about the crocodiles or the disgusting layer of algae.</t1599> <t1600>I just started running and jumped as far as I could.</t1600> <t1601>I landed in water up to my waist, then crossed with long strides.</t1601> <t1602>The water smelled disgusting and created a slimy feeling on my skin, but at least I wasn't wet above my waist.</t1602> <t1603>Or at least not until Margo jumped in, splashing water all over me.</t1603> <t1604>I turned around and splashed her back.</t1604> <t1605>She pretended to gag.</t1605>
<t1606>“Ninjas do not splash water on other ninjas,” he complained.</t1606>
<t1607>“A true ninja does not splash water in any way,” I said.</t1607>
<t1608>"Touché."</t1608><t1609>"</t1609>
<t1610>I was watching Margo pull herself up from the ditch.</t1610> <t1611>And I was genuinely glad for the absence of crocodiles.</t1611> <t1612>And although my pulse was a bit fast, it was at an acceptable rate.</t1612> <t1613>And the black t-shirt under Margo's unzipped hooded jacket was wet and clinging to her.</t1613> <t1614>In short, many things were going quite well until I noticed out of the corner of my eye that there was something crawling in the water next to Margo.</t1614> <t1615>Margo started to get out of the water, I could see her Achilles tendon tensing, and before I could say anything, the snake attacked and bit her left ankle just below her cuff.</t1615>
<t1616>“Damn it!” said Margo, looked down and then again, “Damn it!” she said.</t1616> <t1617>The snake was still on her foot.</t1617> <t1618>I reached down, grabbed the snake by its tail, and yanked it off Margo’s leg, throwing it into the ditch.</t1618> <t1619>“Oh, God,” she said.</t1619> <t1620>“What was that?</t1620> <t1621>Was it a venomous water snake?</t1621><t1622>”</t1622>
<t1623>“I don't know.</t1623> <t1624>Lie down, lie down,” I said and grabbed his leg, pulling up his jeans.</t1624> <t1625>Two drops of blood had come out from where the snake had bitten, I bent down and placed my mouth over the wound, trying to suck out the venom as strongly as I could.</t1625> <t1626>I spat, was about to go back to his leg when he said, “Wait, I see it.”</t1626> <t1627>I jumped up in horror and Margo said, “No no, God, it's just a small snake.”</t1627> <t1628>She was pointing inside the ditch, my finger followed</t1628>
<t1629>I did, and near the surface, I could see a small snake swimming at the edge of a projector light.</t1629> <t1630>From the well-lit distance, the creature didn't look more frightening than a baby lizard.</t1630>
<t1631>“Thank God,” I said as I sat down next to Margo to catch my breath.</t1631> <t1632>After looking at the bite and seeing that the bleeding had already stopped, she asked, “How was it to mess with my leg?”</t1632>
<t1633>"Quite well," I said, which was true.</t1633> <t1634>She leaned her body slightly against mine, and I felt her upper arm on my ribs.</t1634>
<t1635>“That's exactly why I shaved this morning.</t1635> <t1636>I thought, 'You never know when you'll have to latch onto someone's calf and try to suck out snake venom.'</t1636><t1637>”</t1637>
<t1638>There were barbed wires in front of us, but they were only about two meters high.</t1638> <t1639>As Margo put it, "Unbelievable, first snakes, now barbed wire?</t1639> <t1640>This security is an insult to a ninja."</t1640> <t1641>She quickly climbed up and descended as if the barbed wire were a ladder.</t1641> <t1642>I also managed not to fall.</t1642>
<t1643>We ran tightly clinging to the large opaque pools that might contain animals, through a small row of trees, and then we emerged onto an asphalt path where I saw the big amphitheater where Shamu splashed water on me when I was a child.</t1643> <t1644>Soft music was playing from small speakers lined up along the walking platform.</t1644> <t1645>Maybe it was to calm the animals.</t1645> <t1646>“Margo,” I said, “we're in SeaWorld.</t1646><t1647>”</t1647>
<t1648>He said, "Really," then ran, and I followed him.</t1648> <t1649>We stopped by the seal pool, but it looked like there were no seals in it.</t1649>
<t1650>“Margo,” I said again.</t1650> <t1651>“We are at SeaWorld.</t1651><t1652>”</t1652>
<t1653>“I’m having fun,” he said without moving his mouth too much.</t1653> <t1654>“Because security is coming.”</t1654> <t1655>I jumped into the waist-high bushes but stopped when Margo didn’t run.</t1655> <t1656>A man wearing a SEAWORLD SECURITY vest approached us and said quite casually, “How are you, young</t1656>
<t1657>"What?" he asked.</t1657> <t1658>He was holding a box...</t1658> <t1659>I guessed it was pepper spray.</t1659>
<t1660>To stay calm, I started thinking to myself.</t1660> <t1661>Are they using ordinary handcuffs or special SeaWorld handcuffs?</t1661> <t1662>Are they perhaps two interlocking dolphin-shaped ones?</t1662> <t1663>"We were just about to leave, actually," said Margo.</t1663>
<t1664>“No doubt about it,” said the man.</t1664> <t1665>“The question is whether you will walk out or be forcibly removed by the Orange County sheriff.” Margo said, “If it’s all the same to you, we’d prefer to walk.”</t1665> <t1666>I closed my eyes.</t1666> <t1667>This, I meant to tell Margo, is not the time for a witty remark.</t1667> <t1668>But the man laughed.</t1668>
<t1669>"You know, a few years ago, a man who jumped into the big pool was killed, we were told not to let anyone in without permission, whether they are beautiful or not."</t1669> <t1670>Margo tugged at her shirt so it wouldn't look too tight.</t1670> <t1671>Only then did I realize that the man was talking to Margo's breasts.</t1671>
<t1672>“Well, then you have to arrest us.</t1672><t1673>”</t1673>
<t1674>“But the thing is this.</t1674> <t1675>I was about to hit the road, go home, have a beer, and get some sleep, and if I call the police, they won't be in any hurry to come.</t1675> <t1676>I'm just thinking out loud,” he said, then Margo looked up in agreement.</t1676> <t1677>He put his hand into his wet pocket and pulled out a hundred-dollar bill soaked from the water in the ditch.</t1677>
<t1678>The guard said, "Well, it's best if you leave now.</t1678> <t1679>If I were you, I wouldn't exit by passing next to the whale pool.</t1679> <t1680>There are security cameras working all night around the pool, and we don't want anyone to notice that you were here.</t1680><t1681>"</t1681>
<t1682>“At your service,” said Margo with a dignified manner, and with that, the man disappeared into the darkness.</t1682> <t1683>“Oh,” murmured Margo once the man was gone, “I really didn't want to give money to that creep.</t1683> <t1684>But never mind.</t1684> <t1685>Money is meant to be spent.”</t1685> <t1686>I could barely hear her; the only thing was, wave after wave from my skin</t1686>
<t1687>the spreading feeling of relaxation.</t1687> <t1688>This pure pleasure was worth all the worries experienced before.</t1688>
<t1689>"Thank God he won't report us," I said.</t1689>
<t1690>Margo did not respond.</t1690> <t1691>She was looking somewhere behind me, her eyes squinted, almost closed.</t1691> <t1692>"I felt exactly the same way when I entered Universal Studios," she said after a short while.</t1692> <t1693>"It's very nice and all, but there's not much to see.</t1693> <t1694>The tours aren't running.</t1694> <t1695>Everything beautiful is locked up.</t1695> <t1696>Most of the animals are put in different pools at night."</t1696> <t1697>She turned her head and looked at SeaWorld as if appraising it.</t1697> <t1698>"I guess the fun isn't in being inside.</t1698><t1699>"</t1699>
<t1700>“What's the fun in the job?” I asked.</t1700>
<t1701>“It must be planning.</t1701> <t1702>I don't know.</t1702> <t1703>Doing something never feels as good as you hope.</t1703><t1704>”</t1704>
<t1705>“This makes me feel pretty good,” I confessed.</t1705> <t1706>“Even if there’s nothing to see.”</t1706> <t1707>I sat on a bench, and Margo joined me.</t1707> <t1708>We were both looking at the seal pool, but there were no seals in it, just an empty island with plastic rock-like protrusions.</t1708> <t1709>I could smell Margo next to me; sweat and ditch algae, her lilac-scented shampoo, and her skin that smelled like marzipan.</t1709>
<t1710>For the first time, I felt tired and thought of us lying together on a grassy area at SeaWorld; me on my back, her lying on her side with her arm wrapped around me, her head on my shoulder, her face turned towards me.</t1710> <t1711>We are not doing anything...</t1711> <t1712>just lying under the sky, and the night is so well-lit that it outshines the stars.</t1712> <t1713>Maybe I feel her breath on my neck and maybe we stay there until morning, then as people come to the park, they walk past us, see us and think we are tourists too, and we disappear among them.</t1713>
<t1714>But no.</t1714> <t1715>There was still the one-eyed Chuck to see, Ben to tell stories to, and lessons and the band room and Duke and the future...</t1715>
<t1716>"Q," said Margo.</t1716>
<t1717>I looked up at him and for a moment I didn't understand why he said my name, but then suddenly I shook off my drowsy state and came to my senses.</t1717> <t1718>And I heard it.</t1718> <t1719>The volume of the soft music coming from the speakers had increased, but it was no longer soft music... it was real music.</t1719> <t1720>It was that old jazz song called Stars Fell on Alabama, which my father loved.</t1720> <t1721>Even from the worthless speakers, it was possible to understand that the singer could hit a thousand damn notes at once.</t1721>
<t1722>I felt the unbroken bond between him and me, stretching from our cradles to the dead man, from the dead man to our acquaintance, and from there to the present day.</t1722> <t1723>And I wanted to tell him that for me, the pleasure wasn't in planning or doing or leaving that place, but in seeing our strings intersect and diverge, then come together again...</t1723> <t1724>but these seemed too trivial to say, and besides, he was already getting up.</t1724>
<t1725>Margo's bright blue eyes sparkled, and immediately after, she looked incredibly beautiful to me; her jeans were wet, clinging to her legs, and her face was glowing in the gray light.</t1725>
<t1726>I stood up, extended my hand, and said, "Would you honor me with this dance?"</t1726> <t1727>Margo curtsied, extended her hand, and said, "Of course," then my hand was on the curve between her hip and waist, and her hand was on my shoulder.</t1727> <t1728>And then step-side-step, step-side-step...</t1728> <t1729>We did the foxtrot from one end of the seal pool to the other, and the song about shooting stars was still playing.</t1729> <t1730>Margo said, "Sixth-grade style slow dance," we switched places, her hands were on my shoulders and my hand was on her hip, our elbows locked, half a meter between us.</t1730> <t1731>Then we did a bit more foxtrot...</t1731> <t1732>until the song ended.</t1732> <t1733>I stepped forward and made Margo lean back, just as they taught us at Crown Dance School.</t1733> <t1734>When I dipped her, she lifted one leg and put all her weight on me.</t1734> <t1735>Either she trusted me or she wanted to fall.</t1735>
<t1736>We bought drying cloths from the 7-Eleven on the Boulevard and did our best to clean the mud and foul smell from the ditch off our clothes and skin; I filled up the gas tank to where it was before our wandering around Orlando.</t1736> <t1737>When my mom went to work, the seats of the Chrysler would be a bit wet, but I hoped she wouldn’t notice since she was quite careless.</t1737> <t1738>My mom and dad generally believed that I was the best-raised and “least likely to sneak into SeaWorld” person on the planet because my psychological health was proof of their professional abilities.</t1738>
<t1739>I did not hurry to get home by avoiding the highway and using side roads.</t1739> <t1740>Margo and I were listening to the radio and trying to figure out which station was playing Stars Fell on Alabama, but then Margo turned off the radio and said, "In the end, I think this is a success."</t1740>
<t1741>“Absolutely,” I said, but at the same time, I was already wondering how the next day would be.</t1741> <t1742>Would Margo show up by the band room to hang out before school?</t1742> <t1743>Would she have lunch with me and Ben?</t1743> <t1744>“I really wonder if everything will be different tomorrow,” I said.</t1744>
<t1745>“Yes,” he said.</t1745> <t1746>“Me too.” He left the subject unresolved and then, “Hey, speaking of tomorrow, as a thank you for your remarkable hard work and dedication this evening, here's a small</t1746>
<t1747>"I want to give a gift," he said.</t1747> <t1748>He searched for something under his feet and took out a camera.</t1748> <t1749>"Take this," he said.</t1749> <t1750>"And use the Power of the Little Penis wisely.</t1750><t1751>"</t1751>
<t1752>I laughed and put the machine in my pocket.</t1752> <t1753>“When we get home, I'll upload the photo to the computer and then give it back to you at school?” I asked.</t1753> <t1754>I still wanted him to say: Yes, at school, where everything will be different, where I will be your friend in public and obviously without a girlfriend, but he only said, “Yes, or whenever.”</t1754>
<t1755>When I returned to Jefferson Park, it was 05:42.</t1755> <t1756>We proceeded from Jefferson Street towards the Jefferson Courthouse, then turned onto our own street, Jefferson Road.</t1756> <t1757>One last time, I turned off the headlights and idled towards the garage.</t1757> <t1758>I didn't know what to say, and Margo wasn't saying anything either.</t1758> <t1759>We filled a 7-Eleven bag with trash, trying to make it look like the Chrysler hadn't existed for the last six hours.</t1759> <t1760>Margo handed me the remaining Vaseline, spray paint, and the last full Mountain Dew in another bag.</t1760> <t1761>My brain was struggling with exhaustion.</t1761>
<t1762>With bags in both hands, I paused for a moment in front of the minivan, looking at him.</t1762> <t1763>"Well, it was a great night," I said finally.</t1763>
<t1764>“Come here,” he said, and I took a step forward.</t1764> <t1765>He hugged me, the bags made it difficult for me to hug him back, but if I let go, I might wake someone up.</t1765> <t1766>I could feel him standing on his tiptoes, his lips were close to my ear and clearly, “With you.</t1766> <t1767>Hanging out.</t1767> <t1768>I will miss it,” he said.</t1768>
<t1769>"You don't have to," I replied loudly.</t1769> <t1770>I was trying to hide my disappointment.</t1770> <t1771>"If you don't like them anymore," I said, "hang out with me.</t1771> <t1772>My friends are actually quite nice.</t1772><t1773>"</t1773>
<t1774>His lips were so close to me that I could feel him smiling.</t1774> <t1775>"I'm afraid that's not possible," he whispered.</t1775> <t1776>Then he let me go, but as he stepped back, he continued to look at me</t1776>
<t1777>ended.</t1777> <t1778>Finally, he raised his eyebrows and smiled, and I believed his smile.</t1778> <t1779>I watched him climb a tree, then step onto the ledge in front of the second-floor bedroom window.</t1779> <t1780>He forced the window open and crawled inside.</t1780>
<t1781>I went to my unlocked front door, tiptoed from the kitchen to my room, pulled off my jeans and threw them into a corner of the closet next to the window screen, uploaded Jase's photo to the computer, and got into bed while my mind buzzed with the things I would tell him at school.</t1781>
<t1782>SECOND PART</t1782>
<t1783>Grass</t1783>
<t1784>When my alarm clock started ringing at 06:32, I had only slept for about half an hour.</t1784> <t1785>But I didn't notice the alarm clock ringing until I felt the hands on my shoulders and heard my mother's distant voice saying, "Good morning, sleepyhead."</t1785>
<t1786>“Ahh,” I replied.</t1786> <t1787>Clearly, I felt more tired than I did at 05:55, and I could have skipped school, but I had never been absent and, even though I knew that attending all classes was not particularly impressive or even very commendable, I wanted to see through what I had started.</t1787> <t1788>Also, I wanted to see how he would behave around Margo.</t1788>
<t1789>When I entered the kitchen, my father was having breakfast at the table and telling my mother something.</t1789> <t1790>When he saw me, he paused and asked, "How did you sleep?"</t1790>
<t1791>“Extraordinary,” I said, which was true.</t1791> <t1792>Short but good.</t1792>
<t1793>She smiled.</t1793> <t1794>"I was just telling your mother about a recurring anxiety dream I had," she said.</t1794> <t1795>"I'm in college.</t1795> <t1796>And I'm taking a Hebrew class, but the professor doesn't speak Hebrew and the exams aren't in Hebrew either...</t1796> <t1797>they're in some gibberish language.</t1797> <t1798>But everyone acts like this made-up language with a made-up alphabet is Hebrew.</t1798> <t1799>So I end up taking the exam and have to write in a language I don't know using an alphabet I can't decipher.</t1799><t1800>"</t1800>
<t1801>"Interesting," I said, although it wasn't actually so.</t1801> <t1802>There is nothing as boring as other people's dreams.</t1802>
<t1803>“This is a metaphor for your adolescence,” my mother began.</t1803> <t1804>“Writing in a language you don't understand is adulthood, using an unfamiliar alphabet is mature social communication.”</t1804> <t1805>My mother worked with troubled youths in reformatories and juvenile prisons.</t1805> <t1806>I think the reason she never seriously worried about me was this...</t1806> <t1807>As long as I wasn't tearing off rodents' heads for rituals or peeing on my own face, she considered me a success.</t1807>
<t1808>A normal mother might have said: "Hey, you look like you've returned from a weed trip and you faintly smell of seaweed.</t1808> <t1809>Is it possible that a few hours ago you danced with Margo Roth Spiegelman, who might have been bitten by a snake?”</t1809> <t1810>But no.</t1810> <t1811>They preferred dreams.</t1811>
<t1812>I took a shower, put on a t-shirt and jeans.</t1812> <t1813>I was late, but after all, I was always late.</t1813>
<t1814>"You're late," said my mother when I finally managed to return to the kitchen.</t1814> <t1815>I tried to clear the fog in my brain just enough to remember how to tie my sneakers.</t1815>
<t1816>"I'm aware," I replied weakly.</t1816>
<t1817>My mother drove me to school.</t1817> <t1818>I sat in the seat where Margo used to sit.</t1818> <t1819>My mother was silent while driving, which was a good thing because I was sleeping with my head resting against the car window.</t1819>
<t1820>When I arrived at school, I saw that Margo's usual spot in the senior parking lot was empty.</t1820> <t1821>I couldn't blame her for being late.</t1821> <t1822>Her friends didn't gather as early as mine did.</t1822>
<t1823>As I walked towards the binoculars, Ben shouted: "Jacobsen, was I dreaming or did you..."</t1823> <t1824>I looked at him and nodded slightly, and he shifted gears mid-sentence: "...</t1824> <t1825>and I yesterday</t1825>
<t1826>Did we have a wild adventure in French Polynesia, traveling by night on a sailboat made of bananas?</t1826><t1827>"</t1827>
<t1828>“It was a very delicious sailboat,” I replied.</t1828> <t1829>Radar looked at me and walked, swaying, towards the shade of a tree.</t1829> <t1830>I followed him.</t1830> <t1831>“I asked Angela for a girl for Ben.</t1831> <t1832>In vain.” I glanced at Ben, who was speaking cheerfully, with a drink stirrer dancing in his mouth as he talked.</t1832>
<t1833>“Terrible,” I said.</t1833> <t1834>“Still, no problem.</t1834> <t1835>We will hang out together and do a Resurrection marathon or something.</t1835><t1836>”</t1836>
<t1837>Then Ben came to us and said, "Do you think I don't notice?</t1837> <t1838>Because I know you're talking about the ball tragedy that makes up my life without the little bunny."</t1838> <t1839>He turned around and walked inside.</t1839> <t1840>We followed him with Radar, talking as we passed by the band room where freshmen and sophomores were sitting and chatting among the instrument cases.</t1840>
<t1841>“Why do you want to leave?” I asked.</t1841>
<t1842>"My friend, this is our graduation ball.</t1842> <t1843>It's my last chance to be the most love-filled high school memory of a little bunny."</t1843> <t1844>I rolled my eyes.</t1844>
<t1845>The first bell rang, indicating that there were five minutes left until class, and people started filling the hallways in a hurry, like Pavlov's dogs.</t1845> <t1846>Radar and I stood next to Radar's locker.</t1846> <t1847>"So, why did you call me at three in the morning to get Chuck Parson's address?</t1847><t1848>"</t1848>
<t1849>When I saw Chuck Parson coming towards us, I was racking my brain on how to best answer this question.</t1849> <t1850>I nudged Ben's side with my elbow and pointed at Chuck with a glance.</t1850> <t1851>Coincidentally, Chuck had decided that the best strategy was to shave the left side as well.</t1851> <t1852>"Wow," said Ben.</t1852>
<t1853>Immediately after, when Chuck got right up in my face, I shrank back towards the cupboard; his arm was incredibly hairless.</t1853> <t1854>"What are you assholes looking at?"</t1854><t1855>"</t1855>
<t1856>“Nothing at all,” said Radar.</t1856> <t1857>“We are definitely not looking at your eyebrows.”</t1857> <t1858>Chuck gestured to Radar, hit the cabinet next to me with the palm of his hand, and walked away.</t1858>
<t1859>"Did you do this?" Ben asked incredulously.</t1859>
<t1860>"Don't tell anyone," I said to both of them.</t1860> <t1861>Then quietly, I added, "I was with Margo Roth Spiegelman."</t1861>
<t1862>Ben's voice rose with excitement.</t1862> <t1863>"Were you with Margo Roth Spiegelman last night?</t1863> <t1864>AT THREE IN THE MORNING!" I nodded.</t1864> <t1865>"Alone?" I nodded.</t1865> <t1866>"Oh my God, if you hooked up with her, you have to tell me everything.</t1866> <t1867>You need to write me a term paper about how Margo Roth Spiegelman's breasts look and feel.</t1867> <t1868>Thirty pages, at least!</t1868><t1869>"</t1869>
<t1870>“I want you to do a pencil drawing with photographic realism,” said Radar.</t1870>
<t1871>“A statue would also be acceptable,” added Ben.</t1871>
<t1872>Radar raised his hand a little.</t1872> <t1873>“Yes, I was wondering if it was possible for you to write a poem about Margo Roth Spiegelman's breasts.</t1873> <t1874>Your six words are: pink, round, firm, full, elastic, and soft.</t1874><t1875>”</t1875>
<t1876>“Personally,” said Ben, “I think at least one of these words should be babababa.</t1876><t1877>”</t1877>
<t1878>"I don't think I'm familiar with that word," I said.</t1878>
<t1879>“This is the sound that comes out of my mouth when I give a patented Ben Starling Speed Motor to a little bunny.”</t1879> <t1880>At this point, Ben mimicked what he would do in the highly unlikely event of being confronted with a cleavage.</t1880>
<t1881>“Right now,” I said, “thousands of girls all across America are trembling with fear and feeling disgusted to their core, even though they don't know why.</t1881> <t1882>Anyway, I didn't hook up with Margo, you pervert.</t1882><t1883>”</t1883>
<t1884>“As usual,” said Ben.</t1884> <t1885>“I am the only man who can give a bunny what it wants and the only one who never gets the chance.</t1885><t1886>”</t1886>
<t1887>“What a surprising coincidence,” I said.</t1887> <t1888>Life was as it always was...</t1888> <t1889>only I was more tired.</t1889> <t1890>I had hoped that last night would change my life, but it hadn't...</t1890> <t1891>at least not yet.</t1891>
<t1892>The second bell rang.</t1892> <t1893>We hurried to class.</t1893>
<t1894>I started to feel extremely tired during the first math class.</t1894> <t1895>I mean, I had been tired since I woke up, but the combination of tiredness and math seemed unfair.</t1895> <t1896>To stay awake, I scribbled a note to Margo—it wasn't something I would actually send her, just a summary of my favorite moments from the previous night—but even that couldn't keep me awake.</t1896> <t1897>At one point, my pen stopped moving, and I found my field of vision narrowing; then I tried to remember if tunnel vision was a symptom of tiredness.</t1897> <t1898>I decided it must be because there was only one thing in front of me, and that was Mr. Jiminez on the board, the only thing my brain could perceive, and on top of that, when Mr. Jiminez said, "Quentin?" I was extremely confused because the only thing in my universe was Mr. Jiminez writing on the board, and I couldn't comprehend how he could have both an auditory and visual presence in my life.</t1898>
<t1899>"Yes?" I asked.</t1899>
<t1900>“Did you hear the question?</t1900><t1901>”</t1901>
<t1902>“Yes?” I asked again.</t1902>
<t1903>“And did you raise your hand to answer?”</t1903> <t1904>I looked up, indeed my hand was raised but I didn't know how it had happened, I only seemed to know how to manage lowering it.</t1904> <t1905>However, after a considerable struggle, my brain was able to tell my arm to lower itself and my arm was able to comply, then finally, I said, “I just needed to ask if I could go to the bathroom.”</t1905>
<t1906>He also said, "Of course," then someone else raised their hand and answered a question about the differential equation.</t1906>
<t1907>I went to the bathroom and splashed water on my face, then leaned over the sink, approached the mirror, and examined myself.</t1907> <t1908>I tried to fix my bloodshot eyes by rubbing them, but I couldn't.</t1908> <t1909>Then a great idea came to my mind.</t1909> <t1910>I entered one of the stalls, closed the toilet lid, sat down, leaned to the side, and fell asleep; I managed to sleep for about sixteen milliseconds before the second bell rang.</t1910> <t1911>I got up and went to Latin class, then physics, and finally, the break came. I found Ben in the cafeteria and said, "I really need a short nap."</t1911>
<t1912>“Come on, let's go out for lunch with SESIB,” he said.</t1912>
<t1913>SESIB was a fifteen-year-old Buick that had been recklessly used by Ben's three older brothers, and by the time it was given to Ben, it was essentially made up of duct tape and filler.</t1913> <t1914>Its full name was Drive Hard Leave Wet, but we simply called it SESIB.</t1914> <t1915>SESIB didn't run on gasoline but on the inexhaustible fuel of human hope.</t1915> <t1916>You would sit on its vinyl seat, hot enough to be called scorching, and hope it would start; then Ben would turn the key and the engine would sputter a few times, like a weak, lifeless fish gasping its last on dry land.</t1916> <t1917>Then you would hope some more, and the engine would sputter a few more times.</t1917> <t1918>You would hope a bit more, and finally, it would start.</t1918>
<t1919>Ben started the SESIB and turned on the air conditioner.</t1919> <t1920>Three of the four windows wouldn't even open, but the air conditioner was working magnificently; still, for the first few minutes, only hot air was gushing out of the vents, mixing with the hot, stale air inside the car.</t1920> <t1921>Wanting to almost lie down, I reclined the passenger seat and told Ben everything: Margo at my window, Walmart, the revenge, the SunTrust building, entering the wrong house, SeaWorld, "I'll miss hanging out with you."</t1921>
<t1922>He didn't interrupt me even once. He was a good friend in terms of not interrupting, but as soon as I finished, he immediately asked me the most urgent question on his mind.</t1922>
<t1923>“Wait, about Jase Worthington...</t1923> <t1924>how young are we talking?</t1924><t1925>”</t1925>
<t1926>“Shrinking might have played a role because he was experiencing considerable anxiety, but...</t1926> <t1927>‘have you ever seen a pencil?’ I asked, I nodded.</t1927> <t1928>‘Well, have you ever seen an eraser?’ I nodded again.</t1928> <t1929>‘Well, have you ever seen the little eraser crumbs left on the paper after erasing something?’</t1929> <t1930>I nodded a bit more.</t1930> <t1931>‘I’m saying three crumbs long and one crumb wide,’ I said.</t1931> <t1932>He had suffered a lot from kids like Jason Worthington and Chuck Parson, so I thought he deserved to enjoy this situation a bit.</t1932> <t1933>But he didn’t even laugh.</t1933> <t1934>He just slowly nodded, entranced.</t1934>
<t1935>‘My God, Margo is a real pain in the neck.</t1935><t1936>”</t1936>
<t1937>“I know.</t1937><t1938>”</t1938>
<t1939>‘Either the kind of person who will tragically die at twenty-seven like Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin, or conversely, someone who will live to win the first Nobel Awesomeness Prize or something.</t1939><t1940>”</t1940>
<t1941>“Yes,” I said.</t1941> <t1942>I rarely got tired of talking about Margo Roth Spiegelman, but I was rarely this tired anyway.</t1942> <t1943>I leaned back against the cracked vinyl headrest and immediately fell asleep.</t1943> <t1944>When I woke up, there was a note and a Wendy’s hamburger on my lap.</t1944> <t1945>Had to go to class, buddy.</t1945> <t1946>See you after band practice.</t1946>
<t1947>Later, after my last class, I did an Ovid translation while sitting on the concrete wall outside the band room, trying to ignore the wailing cacophony coming from inside.</t1947> <t1948>I would hang around the school for an extra hour during band practice because leaving school without Ben and Radar meant enduring the unbearable shame of being the lone senior on the bus.</t1948>
<t1949>After they went outside, I took Radar to Jefferson Park "village center" near where Lacey was sitting</t1949>
<t1950>He dropped her off at the house right next to mine.</t1950><t1951>Then he took me home.</t1951><t1952>I noticed that Margo's car wasn't parked in the driveway either.</t1952><t1953>So she hadn't skipped school to sleep.</t1953><t1954>She had skipped school for another adventure...</t1954><t1955>an adventure without me.</t1955><t1956>She had probably spent her day putting hair removal cream on the pillows of her other enemies or something.</t1956><t1957>I felt a bit left out as I walked into the house, but of course, she knew I would never, under any circumstances, join her...</t1957><t1958>I cared too much about the school day.</t1958><t1959>And who could have known that I would be just one day for Margo.</t1959><t1960>Maybe she had gone on a three-day trip to Mississippi or temporarily joined a circus.</t1960><t1961>But of course, it was none of those things.</t1961><t1962>It was something I couldn't imagine, something I would never imagine, because I couldn't be like Margo.</t1962>
<t1963>I wondered what stories I would come home with during this time.</t1963> <t1964>And whether you would tell them to me while sitting across from me at lunch.</t1964> <t1965>Maybe, I thought, when you said you would miss hanging out with me, this is what you meant.</t1965> <t1966>He knew I would set out somewhere to take a break from Orlando's paperwork.</t1966> <t1967>But who knows when he would come back.</t1967> <t1968>He couldn't spend the last weeks of school with his usual friends, so maybe despite everything, he would spend them with me.</t1968>
<t1969>It didn't take long for rumors to start once Margo was gone.</t1969> <t1970>That night, after dinner, Ben called.</t1970> <t1971>"I heard Margo isn't answering her phone.</t1971> <t1972>Someone on Facebook said she told them she might move to a secret warehouse in Disney Tomorrowland."</t1972> <t1973>"That's so stupid," I said.</t1973>
<t1974>"I know.</t1974> <t1975>I mean, Tomorrowland is by far Disney's crappiest park.</t1975> <t1976>Someone else also said that Margo met a boy online.</t1976><t1977>"</t1977>
<t1978>“Very silly,” I said.</t1978>
<t1979>“Alright, but what could have happened?</t1979><t1980>”</t1980>
<t1981>“Somewhere, he must be amusing himself in a way we can only dream of,” I said.</t1981>
<t1982>Ben giggled.</t1982> <t1983>“Are you saying she's playing with herself?” I whined.</t1983> <t1984>“Don't, Ben.</t1984> <t1985>I just meant she's doing Margo-like things.</t1985> <t1986>Creating stories.</t1986> <t1987>Shaking worlds.</t1987><t1988>”</t1988>
<t1989>That night, I lay on my side and looked out the window at the invisible world outside.</t1989> <t1990>I tried to sleep, but my eyes kept opening...</t1990> <t1991>just to check.</t1991> <t1992>All I could do was hope that Margo Roth Spiegelman would turn up at my window and drag my tired ass into another night I would never forget.</t1992>
<t1993>Margo used to leave so often that even though there were no Find Margo meetings organized at school, we all felt her absence.</t1993> <t1994>High school is neither a democracy nor a dictatorship...</t1994> <t1995>nor an anarchic system contrary to popular belief.</t1995> <t1996>High school is a monarchy with a divine right to rule.</t1996> <t1997>And when the Queen goes on vacation, things change.</t1997> <t1998>To be more specific, things get worse.</t1998> <t1999>For example, Becca's Bloody Ben story was unleashed upon the world when Margo went to Mississippi in her sophomore year.</t1999> <t2000>Now, the situation was no different.</t2000> <t2001>The little girl who had her finger in the dam had fled.</t2001> <t2002>A flood was inevitable.</t2002>
<t2003>That morning, for the first time, I left on time and went to school with Ben.</t2003> <t2004>Outside the band room, we found everyone unusually quiet.</t2004> <t2005>Our friend Frank said with great seriousness, "Dude."</t2005>
<t2006>“What happened?</t2006><t2007>”</t2007>
<t2008>“Chuck Parson, Taddy Mac, and Clint Bauer took Clint’s Tahoe and ran over twelve bicycles belonging to the first and second graders.</t2008><t2009>”</t2009>
<t2010>“Terrible,” I said, shaking my head.</t2010>
<t2011>Our friend Ashley added, "Also, yesterday someone wrote our phone numbers in the men's restroom, with some...</t2011> <t2012>dirty thing," she added.</t2012>
<t2013>I nodded my head again, then joined the silence.</t2013> <t2014>We couldn't complain about them; we had tried many times in middle school and it had inevitably resulted in more punishment.</t2014> <t2015>We usually had to rely on someone like Margo to remind everyone how immature fools they were.</t2015>
<t2016>Ama Margo had given me a way to initiate a counterattack.</t2016> <t2017>I was just about to say something when I saw, out of the corner of my eye, a burly figure running towards us at full speed.</t2017> <t2018>He was wearing a black ski mask and carrying a large, green water gun.</t2018> <t2019>As he ran past me, he bumped into my shoulder, causing me to lose my balance and fall onto my left side on the cracked concrete.</t2019> <t2020>When he reached the door, he turned back and shouted at me: "If you mess with us, you'll face defeat."</t2020> <t2021>The voice was not familiar.</t2021>
<t2022>Ben and another friend lifted me up.</t2022> <t2023>My shoulder was hurting, but I didn't want to rub it.</t2023> <t2024>"Are you okay?" asked Radar.</t2024>
<t2025>“Yes, I'm fine.”</t2025> <t2026>I was now rubbing my shoulder.</t2026>
<t2027>Radar nodded his head.</t2027> <t2028>“Someone needs to tell him that while it is possible to be defeated and even to be made to suffer defeat, it is not possible to 'take' defeat.”</t2028> <t2029>I laughed.</t2029> <t2030>Someone pointed with their head towards my parking spot, and when I looked up, I saw two first graders walking towards us, their t-shirts clinging wet and limp to their skinny bodies.</t2030>
<t2031>One of them shouted at us, "Pee!"</t2031> <t2032>The other one didn't say anything; he was just holding his hands away from his t-shirt, but it wasn't doing much good.</t2032> <t2033>I saw trickles of liquid winding down from his t-shirt to his arms.</t2033>
<t2034>“Was it animal pee, or human pee?” someone asked.</t2034>
<t2035>“How should I know!</t2035> <t2036>Am I an expert in pee?</t2036><t2037>”</t2037>
<t2038>I approached the child.</t2038> <t2039>I placed my hand on the only part of him that seemed completely dry, the top of his head.</t2039> <t2040>“We will fix this,” I said.</t2040> <t2041>The second bell rang, and we rushed to math class with Radar.</t2041> <t2042>As I took my seat, I cracked my arm and pain spread to my shoulder.</t2042> <t2043>Radar tapped his notebook, where he had circled a note: Is your shoulder okay?</t2043>
<t2044>I also wrote in the corner of my notebook: Compared to the first graders, I spent the morning jumping and playing with puppies in a meadow filled with rainbows.</t2044>
<t2045>Radar laughed just enough for Bay Jiminez to give him a look.</t2045> <t2046>I wrote, I have a plan, but we need to figure out who he is.</t2046>
<t2047>In response to the radar, Jasper Hanson wrote and circled it several times.</t2047> <t2048>This was surprising indeed.</t2048>
<t2049>How do you know?</t2049>
<t2050>Radar, didn't you notice?</t2050> <t2051>That idiot was wearing his own football jersey, he wrote.</t2051>
<t2052>Jasper Hanson was in a grade below us.</t2052> <t2053>I had always thought of him as harmless, even somewhat a good person...</t2053> <t2054>like those who awkwardly ask "how's it going, buddy".</t2054> <t2055>He wasn't the type of kid you'd expect to spray pee on freshmen.</t2055> <t2056>In fact, at Winter Park High School's administrative bureaucracy, Jasper Hanson was the Deputy Undersecretary for Athletics and Misconduct.</t2056> <t2057>If such a kid is being promoted to Vice President of Pee Spraying, immediate action is necessary.</t2057>
<t2058>That afternoon, when I went home, I opened an email account and wrote an email to my old friend Jason Worthington.</t2058>
<t2059>From: intikamci@gmail.</t2059> <t2060>com</t2060>
<t2061>To: jworthington90@yahoo.</t2061> <t2062>com</t2062>
<t2063>Subject: You, Me, Becca Arrington's House, Your Penis, etc.</t2063>
<t2064>Dear Mr. Worthington,</t2064>
<t2065>Each of the 12 people whose bicycles were destroyed by your coworkers' Chevy Tahoe should be provided with $200 in cash.</t2065> <t2066>Considering your magnificent wealth, this should not be an issue.</t2066>
<t2067>The graffiti situation in the men's restroom must end.</t2067>
<t2068>Water guns?</t2068> <t2069>With pee? Really?</t2069> <t2070>Grow up a little.</t2070> <t2071>You should treat your schoolmates with respect, especially those who are less fortunate socially.</t2071> <t2072>You should probably instruct the members of your clan to behave similarly thoughtfully.</t2072>
<t2073>I am aware that completing some of these tasks will be very difficult.</t2073> <t2074>However, on the other hand, it will also be very difficult not to share the attached photo with the world.</t2074>
<t2075>Yours sincerely,</t2075>
<t2076>Your Eternal Enemy Neighbor's Response arrived twelve minutes later.</t2076>
<t2077>Look, Quentin, and yes, I know this is you.</t2077> <t2078>I'm not the one spraying pee on the freshmen, you know that.</t2078> <t2079>Sorry, but I can't control other people's actions or anything.</t2079>
<t2080>My answer:</t2080>
<t2081>Bay Worthington,</t2081>
<t2082>I understand that you do not control Chuck and Jasper.</t2082> <t2083>But you see, I am in a similar situation.</t2083> <t2084>I cannot control the little devil sitting on my left shoulder.</t2084> <t2085>The devil says: "PRINT THE PHOTO PRINT THE PHOTO STICK IT EVERYWHERE IN THE SCHOOL DO IT DO IT DO IT."</t2085> <t2086>Then on my right shoulder, there is a small, tiny white angel.</t2086> <t2087>And the angel says;</t2087>
<t2088>"My friend, all those first graders' money on Monday"</t2088>
<t2089>I hope they will pick me up early in the morning.</t2089><t2090>"</t2090>
<t2091>Me too, little angel.</t2091> <t2092>Me too.</t2092>
<t2093>With my best wishes,</t2093>
<t2094>You Get Your Eternal Enemy Neighbor</t2094>
<t2095>Jase didn't respond, and he didn't need to.</t2095> <t2096>Everything had been said.</t2096>
<t2097>After dinner, Ben came over, and we played Resurrection, pausing about every half hour to call Radar, who was out on a date with Angela.</t2097> <t2098>We left eleven messages, each more annoying and obscene than the last.</t2098> <t2099>When the doorbell rang, it was past nine o'clock.</t2099> <t2100>My mom shouted, "Quentin!"</t2100> <t2101>Thinking it was Radar, we paused the game and went to the living room.</t2101> <t2102>Standing at my door were Chuck Parson and Jason Worthington.</t2102> <t2103>I approached them, and Jason said, "Hey, Quentin," to which I nodded in greeting.</t2103> <t2104>Jason glanced at Chuck, who muttered, "Sorry, Quentin," while looking at me.</t2104>
<t2105>"Why?" I asked.</t2105>
<t2106>“Because I told Jasper to squirt pee at the first graders,” he muttered.</t2106> <t2107>He paused and then said, “And also for the bikes.”</t2107>
<t2108>He opened his arms as if to hug.</t2108> <t2109>"Come here, brother," he said.</t2109>
<t2110>“What?</t2110><t2111>”</t2111>
<t2112>"Come here," he said again.</t2112> <t2113>Chuck took a step forward.</t2113> <t2114>"Closer," said Ben.</t2114> <t2115>Chuck was now standing completely in the entrance, about half a meter away from Ben.</t2115> <t2116>Suddenly, Ben punched Chuck in the stomach.</t2116> <t2117>Chuck didn't even flinch but immediately moved to retaliate against Ben.</t2117> <t2118>Luckily, Jase grabbed his arm</t2118>
<t2119>caught.</t2119> <t2120>“Calm down, brother,” he said.</t2120> <t2121>“It didn't even hurt.”</t2121> <t2122>Jase extended his hand for a handshake.</t2122> <t2123>“I like your courage, brother,” he said.</t2123> <t2124>“I mean, you're a total ass.</t2124> <t2125>But still.” I shook his hand.</t2125>
<t2126>Then they got into Jase's Lexus and reversed down the driveway.</t2126> <t2127>As soon as the front door closed, Ben let out a scream.</t2127> <t2128>“Ahhhhhhh.</t2128> <t2129>Oh, dear God, my hand.”</t2129> <t2130>He tried to clench his fist and winced.</t2130> <t2131>“I think Chuck Parson had stuck a textbook to his stomach.</t2131><t2132>”</t2132>
<t2133>“They are called karm muscles,” I said.</t2133>
<t2134>“Ah, yes.</t2134> <t2135>I had heard something about them.”</t2135> <t2136>I patted him lightly on the back and we headed back to the bedroom to play Resurrection again.</t2136> <t2137>We had just restarted the game when Ben said, “By the way, did you notice that Jase called me ‘brother’?</t2137> <t2138>I brought back the word brother.</t2138> <t2139>Just by the sheer power of my own magnificence.</t2139><t2140>”</t2140>
<t2141>“Yes, you spend your Friday night playing games and rubbing the hand you broke while trying to throw an unexpected punch at someone.</t2141> <t2142>No wonder Jason Worthington looks up to you as an example to rise.</t2142><t2143>”</t2143>
<t2144>“At least I'm good at Resurrection,” he said, and immediately after, despite us being a team, he shot me in the back.</t2144>
<t2145>We played for a while longer, until Ben, with the gamepad on his chest, curled up on the floor and fell asleep.</t2145> <t2146>I was tired too...</t2146> <t2147>it had been a long day.</t2147> <t2148>I thought Margo would have returned by Monday anyway, but I still felt a bit proud of being the one who prevented the boredom.</t2148>
<t2149>Now, every morning, I would look out of my window to check if there was any sign of life in Margo's room.</t2149> <t2150>She always kept her bamboo blinds closed, but after she left, her mother or someone else had opened them, so I could see a small piece of the blue wall and the white ceiling.</t2150> <t2151>That Saturday morning, forty-eight hours after she had left, I had calculated that she had not yet returned home, but still felt a twinge of disappointment when I saw that the blinds were still open.</t2151>
<t2152>I brushed my teeth, then after kicking Ben briefly to wake him up, I left the room wearing shorts and a t-shirt.</t2152> <t2153>There were five people at the dining table.</t2153> <t2154>My mom, my dad.</t2154> <t2155>Margo's mom and dad.</t2155> <t2156>And a tall, burly, black man with oversized glasses, wearing a gray suit, holding a cardboard file.</t2156> <t2157>"Uh, hi," I said.</t2157>
<t2158>“Quentin,” my mom said, “did you see Margo on Wednesday night?”</t2158> <t2159>I walked into the dining room and leaned against the wall, standing in front of the stranger.</t2159> <t2160>I had already thought about my answer to this question.</t2160> <t2161>“Yes,” I said.</t2161> <t2162>“She appeared at my window around midnight, we talked for a minute, then Mr. Spiegelman caught her and Margo went back home.”</t2162> <t2163>“And this...</t2163> <t2164>Did you see her after that?” asked Mr. Spiegelman.</t2164> <t2165>He seemed quite calm.</t2165>
<t2166>“No, why?” I asked.</t2166>
<t2167>Margo's mother answered in a high-pitched voice.</t2167> <t2168>"Well," she said, "it looks like Margo ran away from home.</t2168> <t2169>Again." She sighed.</t2169> <t2170>"How many times is this, Josh... the fourth time?</t2170><t2171>"</t2171>
<t2172>“Ah, I forgot my number,” his father replied angrily.</t2172>
<t2173>At that point, the black man intervened.</t2173> <t2174>“You are reporting five times.”</t2174> <t2175>The man nodded towards me and said, “Detective Otis Warren.”</t2175>
<t2176>"Quentin Jacobsen," I said.</t2176>
<t2177>Mom stood up and put her hands on Mrs. Spiegelman's shoulders.</t2177> <t2178>“Debbie,” she said, “I’m very sorry.</t2178> <t2179>It’s a very frustrating situation.”</t2179> <t2180>I knew this trick.</t2180> <t2181>It was a psychology trick called empathetic listening.</t2181> <t2182>You say what the person is feeling so they think they are understood.</t2182> <t2183>Mom used to do this to me all the time.</t2183>
<t2184>“I’m not upset,” replied Mrs. Spiegelman.</t2184> <t2185>“I’m just tired of it.</t2185><t2186>”</t2186>
<t2187>“Right,” said Mr. Spiegelman.</t2187> <t2188>“A locksmith will come this afternoon.</t2188> <t2189>We are changing the locks.</t2189> <t2190>Margo is eighteen years old.</t2190> <t2191>So, the detective just said there’s nothing we can do...</t2191><t2192>”</t2192>
<t2193>"Well," Detective Warren interrupted, "I didn't say it exactly like that.</t2193> <t2194>I said that since she is not a minor, she has the right to leave home.</t2194><t2195>"</t2195>
<t2196>Mr. Spiegelman continued talking with my mother.</t2196> <t2197>“We will, of course, cover the university expenses, but this...</t2197> <t2198>we cannot support this foolishness.</t2198> <t2199>Connie, she is eighteen years old!</t2199> <t2200>And still very selfish!</t2200> <t2201>She needs to see the consequences of this.</t2201><t2202>”</t2202>
<t2203>My mother withdrew her hands from Mrs. Spiegelman.</t2203> <t2204>"I would argue that it should yield loving results," my mother said.</t2204>
<t2205>"She is not your daughter, Connie.</t2205> <t2206>She hasn't been trampling over you like a doormat for ten years.</t2206> <t2207>We have another child to think about.</t2207><t2208>"</t2208>
<t2209>“And also ourselves,” added Mr. Spiegelman.</t2209> <t2210>Then he looked at me.</t2210> <t2211>“Quentin, I'm sorry if he tried to drag you into his little game.</t2211> <t2212>You can imagine how...</t2212> <t2213>how embarrassing this is for us.</t2213> <t2214>You are a very good kid, but he is...</t2214> <t2215>a thing.”</t2215> <t2216>I pushed myself off the wall and stood up straight.</t2216> <t2217>I knew Margo's parents a little, but I had never seen them act so viciously.</t2217> <t2218>It was no wonder Margo was mad at them on Wednesday night.</t2218> <t2219>I glanced at the detective.</t2219> <t2220>He was flipping through the pages of the file.</t2220> <t2221>“She is known to leave trails of breadcrumbs, correct?”</t2221> <t2222>“Clues,” said Mr. Spiegelman, now standing.</t2222> <t2223>The detective had placed the file on the table, and Margo's father leaned forward to look at it with him.</t2223> <t2224>“Clues everywhere.</t2224> <t2225>The day she ran away to Mississippi, she had a soup made of letter-shaped noodles and left exactly four letters in the soup bowl: An M, an I, an S, and a P.</t2225> <t2226>She was disappointed when we couldn't piece it together, but when she finally returned, I told her: How can we find you when all we know is Mississippi?</t2226> <t2227>It's a big state, Margo!</t2227><t2228>”</t2228>
<t2229>The detective cleared his throat.</t2229> <t2230>“And when he spent a night inside Disney World, he left Minnie Mouse in his bed.</t2230><t2231>”</t2231>
<t2232>“Yes,” said her mother.</t2232> <t2233>“Clues.</t2233> <t2234>Stupid clues.</t2234> <t2235>But you can never follow them, believe me.</t2235><t2236>”</t2236>
<t2237>The detective lifted his head from his notebook.</t2237> <t2238>"We will spread the news, of course, but he cannot be forced to come home; you should not expect him to be under your roof again in the near future.</t2238><t2239>"</t2239>
<t2240>“I don't want him under our roof.”</t2240> <t2241>Mrs. Spiegelman brought a handkerchief to her eye, yet her voice didn't sound like she was crying at all.</t2241> <t2242>“I know it's terrible, but it's the truth.</t2242><t2243>”</t2243>
<t2244>“Deb,” said my mom in a therapist's voice.</t2244>
<t2245>Bayan Spiegelman just nodded...</t2245> <t2246>A very small nod.</t2246> <t2247>“What can we do?</t2247> <t2248>We told the detective.</t2248> <t2249>We filed a missing person report.</t2249> <t2250>She's an adult, Connie.</t2250><t2251>”</t2251>
<t2252>"He is your grown-up," said my mother, still calmly.</t2252>
<t2253>“Oh, don't do it, Connie.</t2253> <t2254>Is it a disease to consider leaving him outside the house a favor?</t2254> <t2255>Of course, it's diseased.</t2255> <t2256>But he is a disease in this family!</t2256> <t2257>How do you search for someone who declares they won't be found, always leaves clues that lead nowhere, and constantly runs away from home?</t2257> <t2258>You can't search!”</t2258>
<t2259>My mom and dad exchanged glances, then the detective spoke to me.</t2259> <t2260>"Kid, can we talk in private?"</t2260> <t2261>I nodded in agreement.</t2261> <t2262>We found ourselves in my parents' room, he settled into a comfortable chair, and I sat on the edge of the bed.</t2262>
<t2263>“Child,” he said as soon as he sat down, “let me give you some advice: Never work for the government.</t2263> <t2264>Because when you work for the government, you work for the people.</t2264> <t2265>And when you work for the people, you have to interact with people, even with the Spiegelmans.”</t2265> <t2266>I laughed a little.</t2266>
<t2267>“Let me be honest with you, kid.</t2267> <t2268>These people know how to be parents as much as I know how to diet.</t2268> <t2269>I’ve worked with them before and I didn’t like them.</t2269> <t2270>I don’t care if you tell Margo’s parents where she is, but I’d be grateful if you tell me.</t2270><t2271>”</t2271>
<t2272>"I don't know," I said.</t2272> <t2273>"Really.</t2273><t2274>"</t2274>
<t2275>“Son, I was thinking about this girl.</t2275> <t2276>The things she does...</t2276> <t2277>She sneaks into Disney World, for example, right?</t2277> <t2278>She goes to Mississippi and leaves clues in her soup with letters.</t2278> <t2279>She organizes a big campaign to toilet paper houses.</t2279><t2280>”</t2280>
<t2281>"How do you know this?" Two years ago, Margo had led an overnight toilet paper attack on two hundred houses.</t2281> <t2282>Needless to say, I had not been invited to this adventure.</t2282>
<t2283>“I had previously been involved in this event.</t2283> <t2284>So, kid, the point where I need your help is this: Who is planning these things?</t2284> <t2285>These crazy projects.</t2285> <t2286>Margo is the spokesperson for all of them, capable of doing everything</t2286>
<t2287>The person who is crazy.</t2287> <t2288>But who is planning?</t2288> <t2289>Who is filling notebooks with diagrams showing how much toilet paper is needed to attack a ton of houses?</t2289><t2290>”</t2290>
<t2291>“I think it's all Margo's doing.</t2291><t2292>”</t2292>
<t2293>“But he might have a partner, someone who helps him do all these great and clever things and maybe shares his secret; someone who is not obviously in the picture, not his best friend or boyfriend.</t2293> <t2294>Maybe someone who wouldn't immediately come to mind,” he said.</t2294> <t2295>He took a breath, he was about to say something more when I interrupted him.</t2295>
<t2296>“I don't know where she is,” I said.</t2296> <t2297>“I swear.”</t2297> <t2298>“I'm just checking, kid.</t2298> <t2299>Anyway, you know something, don't you?</t2299> <t2300>Then let's start from there.”</t2300> <t2301>I told him everything.</t2301> <t2302>I had trusted the man.</t2302> <t2303>He took a few notes while I was talking, but none of them were very detailed.</t2303> <t2304>And telling the man, his scribbling in the notebook, the badness of her parents...</t2304> <t2305>Made me feel, for the first time, the possibility that Margo might really be missing.</t2305> <t2306>When I finished talking, I felt my breath starting to catch from worry.</t2306> <t2307>The detective didn't say anything for a while.</t2307> <t2308>He just leaned forward in the chair and looked past me until he saw whatever he was expecting to see, then he started to speak.</t2308>
<t2309>“Listen, kid.</t2309> <t2310>It usually goes like this: Typically, a girl is a free spirit and doesn't get along too well with her parents.</t2310> <t2311>These kids are like helium-filled balloons tied down.</t2311> <t2312>They struggle against the string, struggle and struggle, then something happens, the string breaks, and at that moment, they fly away.</t2312> <t2313>Maybe you'll never see the balloon again.</t2313> <t2314>It might land in Canada or somewhere, find a job in a restaurant, and before the balloon even realizes it, it's been serving coffee to the same gloomy drifters in the same diner for thirty years.</t2314> <t2315>Or maybe three or four years later, or three or four days later, the wind brings the balloon back home because either it needs money, has come to its senses, or misses its brother.</t2315> <t2316>But listen, kid, that string always breaks.”</t2316> <t2317>“Yes, but...</t2317><t2318>”</t2318>
<t2319>“I'm not done yet, kid.</t2319> <t2320>The thing about these balloons is that there are really a lot of them.</t2320> <t2321>The sky is crammed full of them, they bump into each other as they float around, and every single one of these damn balloons somehow ends up on my desk, and after a while, you get tired of it.</t2321> <t2322>Balloons everywhere, each one has a mother or a father or, God forbid, both, and after a while, you can't see them individually anymore.</t2322> <t2323>You look at all the balloons in the sky and you can see all of them, but you can never see just one balloon.”</t2323> <t2324>He paused then and took a deep breath, as if he had realized something.</t2324> <t2325>“But then, once in a while, you talk to a kid with too much hair for his head and big eyes, and you want to lie to him, because he looks like a good kid.</t2325> <t2326>Then you feel bad for that kid because the only thing worse than the balloon-filled sky you see is what he sees: A clear, blue sky interrupted by just one balloon.</t2326> <t2327>But once the string is broken, you can't take it back, kid.</t2327> <t2328>Do you understand what I'm saying?</t2328><t2329>”</t2329>
<t2330>I nodded my head up and down, though I wasn't quite sure I understood.</t2330> <t2331>He stood up.</t2331> <t2332>"I think he'll be back soon, son.</t2332> <t2333>If it will help."</t2333><t2334>"</t2334>
<t2335>I liked imagining Margo as a balloon, but while the detective approached the matter poetically, I thought he saw worry in me rather than the sudden pang I actually felt.</t2335> <t2336>I knew Margo would come back.</t2336> <t2337>She would deflate and float back towards Jefferson Park.</t2337> <t2338>She had always done so.</t2338>
<t2339>I followed the detective back to the dining room, then he said he wanted to return to the Spiegelmans' house and examine Margo's room a bit.</t2339> <t2340>Mrs. Spiegelman hugged me and said, "You have always been a very good child; I'm sorry if he dragged you into this nonsense."</t2340> <t2341>Mr. Spiegelman shook my hand and they left.</t2341> <t2342>As soon as the door closed, my father said, "Wow."</t2342>
<t2343>“Wow,” my mom chimed in.</t2343>
<t2344>My father wrapped his arm around me.</t2344> <t2345>“These are very disturbing actions, aren't they buddy?</t2345><t2346>”</t2346>
<t2347>“They look like idiots,” I said.</t2347> <t2348>My parents liked it when I swore in front of them.</t2348> <t2349>I could see from their expressions that they were pleased by this.</t2349> <t2350>This showed that I trusted them, that I was being myself in front of them.</t2350> <t2351>But despite this, they looked sad.</t2351>
<t2352>“Whenever Margo does something mischievous, her mother and father suffer the pain of a serious narcissistic wound,” said my father.</t2352>
<t2353>“This also prevents them from parenting effectively,” my mother added.</t2353>
<t2354>“They are really assholes,” I repeated.</t2354>
<t2355>“If you ask me,” said my father, “they're probably right.</t2355> <t2356>Margo is most likely in need of attention.</t2356> <t2357>And God knows, if these two were my parents, I would need attention too.</t2357><t2358>”</t2358>
<t2359>“When Margo returns,” said my mother, “she will be devastated.</t2359> <t2360>To be abandoned like this!..</t2360> <t2361>To be left out when she needs to be loved the most...</t2361><t2362>”</t2362>
<t2363>“Maybe she can live here when she arrives,” I said, and as I spoke, I realized what a wonderful idea it was.</t2363> <t2364>My mother's eyes lit up too, but then she saw something in my father's expression and responded to me with her usual measured demeanor.</t2364>
<t2365>“Well, she can come if she wants, but there are some issues with this situation...</t2365> <t2366>Like being next to the Spiegelmans.</t2366> <t2367>But when she returns to school, please tell her that we invited her here and that if she doesn't want to stay with us, we would be happy to discuss many other options.</t2367><t2368>”</t2368>
<t2369>At that moment, Ben arrived, his hair in a state that seemed to defy our understanding of gravity, as if he had just gotten out of bed.</t2369> <t2370>“Mr. and Mrs. Jacobsen...</t2370> <t2371>it's so nice to see you.</t2371><t2372>”</t2372>
<t2373>"Good morning, Ben.</t2373> <t2374>I didn't realize you stayed the night.</t2374><t2375>"</t2375>
<t2376>"I wasn't either, actually," he said.</t2376> <t2377>"Is there a problem?</t2377><t2378>"</t2378>
<t2379>I told Ben about the detective, the Spiegelmans, and how Margo was technically a missing adult.</t2379> <t2380>When I finished, he nodded and said, "We should probably discuss this over a hot plate of Resurrection."</t2380> <t2381>I smiled and followed him back to my room.</t2381> <t2382>Shortly after, Radar arrived, and as soon as he did, I was kicked off the team because we were facing a tough mission, and even though I was actually the only one among us who owned the game, I wasn't very good at Resurrection.</t2382> <t2383>As I watched them navigate a zombie-infested space station, Ben said, "Goblin, Radar, goblin."</t2383> <t2384>"I see.</t2384><t2385>"</t2385>
<t2386>"Come here, you little rascal," said Ben, twirling the gamepad in his hand.</t2386> <t2387>"Daddy is going to put you on a sailboat on the River Styx."</t2387> <t2388>"Did you just use Greek mythology in your provocative speech?</t2388><t2389>"</t2389>
<t2390>Radar laughed.</t2390> <t2391>I started hitting the buttons and shouting: 'Eat this, goblin! Eat this like Zeus ate Metis!'</t2391><t2392>"</t2392>
<t2393>“I think you will have returned by Monday,” I said.</t2393> <t2394>“You wouldn't want to skip too many classes, even if you were Margo Roth Spiegelman.</t2394> <t2395>Maybe you could stay here until graduation.</t2395><t2396>”</t2396>
<t2397>Radar, someone playing Resurrection, responded to me in a way that seemed disconnected from life.</t2397> <t2398>“I don't even understand why he left, is the reason just because of the dwarf at six o'clock, buddy use your ray gun, because of the love he lost or something?</t2398> <t2399>I used to think he was indifferent to these kinds of things, where's the cellar, on the left?</t2399><t2400>”</t2400>
<t2401>“No,” I said.</t2401> <t2402>“I don't think that's the reason.</t2402> <t2403>At least, it wasn't just because of that.</t2403> <t2404>He hates Orlando, he called this place a paper town.</t2404> <t2405>Meaning, like, everything is very fake and flimsy.</t2405> <t2406>I think he just wanted to escape this situation and take a vacation.</t2406><t2407>”</t2407>
<t2408>7</t2408> <t2409>In Greek mythology, the river that carries the souls of the dead to the underworld, (abbr.</t2409> <t2410>n)</t2410>
<t2411>I looked out the window and at that moment I was guessing someone was a detective, I saw that Margo had lowered the blinds in her room.</t2411> <t2412>But I couldn't see the blinds.</t2412> <t2413>Instead, I saw a black and white poster taped behind the blinds.</t2413> <t2414>In the photo, there was a man with slightly slumped shoulders, looking straight ahead.</t2414> <t2415>A cigarette was hanging from his mouth.</t2415> <t2416>A guitar was slung over his shoulder and the words "THIS MACHINE KILLS FASCISTS" were written on the guitar.</t2416>
<t2417>"There is something at Margo's window."</t2417> <t2418>The game's music stopped, and Radar and Ben knelt down beside me.</t2418> <t2419>"Is it new?" asked Radar.</t2419>
<t2420>“I have seen those blinds millions of times,” I replied, “but I have never seen that poster before.</t2420><t2421>”</t2421>
<t2422>“Strange,” said Ben.</t2422>
<t2423>“Margo's parents said just this morning that sometimes she leaves clues,” I said.</t2423> <t2424>“But never anything, I don't know, concrete enough for them to find her before she comes home.</t2424><t2425>”</t2425>
<t2426>Radar had already taken out his pocket computer and was researching that sentence on Omnictionary.</t2426> <t2427>“The guy in the photo is Woody Guthrie,” he said.</t2427> <t2428>“A folk music singer, lived from 1912 to 1967.</t2428> <t2429>He sang songs about the working class.</t2429> <t2430>This Land Is Your Land.</t2430> <t2431>A bit of a Communist.</t2431> <t2432>Hmm, he inspired Bob Dylan.”</t2432> <t2433>Radar played a part of one of his songs...</t2433> <t2434>a very high-pitched, crackling voice was singing a song about unions.</t2434>
<t2435>"I will send an email to the kid who wrote most of this page and see if there is a clear connection between Margo and Woody Guthrie," said Radar.</t2435>
<t2436>"I can't even imagine that you like his songs," I said.</t2436>
<t2437>“Seriously,” said Ben.</t2437> <t2438>“This guy's voice sounds like an alcoholic Kermit the Frog who has throat cancer.</t2438><t2439>”</t2439>
<t2440>Radar opened the window and stuck his head out.</t2440> <t2441>“It definitely looks like he left this for you, Q.</t2441> <t2442>I mean, does he know anyone else who can see this window?”</t2442> <t2443>I shook my head to mean no.</t2443>
<t2444>A moment later Ben added: "The way the man looks at us...</t2444> <t2445>like, 'give me your attention.'</t2445> <t2446>His head is like, you know...</t2446> <t2447>Not like he's standing on stage but like he's standing in a doorway or something.</t2447><t2448>"</t2448>
<t2449>“I think he wants us to go inside,” I said.</t2449>
<t2450>Since we couldn't see the front door or the garage from my room, we had to sit in the living room.</t2450> <t2451>So Ben, while continuing to play Resurrection, and I went out with Radar to the living room and pretended to watch TV, watching the Spiegelmans' front door through the big window, waiting for Margo's parents to leave the house.</t2451> <t2452>Detective Warren's black Ford Crown Victoria was still in the driveway.</t2452>
<t2453>About fifteen minutes later, the detective left, but neither the garage door nor the front door opened again for an hour.</t2453> <t2454>We were watching a semi-entertaining marijuana-themed comedy on HBO with Radar when I started getting into the story, and Radar said, "Garage door."</t2454> <t2455>I jumped off the couch and approached the window to see who was in the car.</t2455> <t2456>Mr. and Mrs. Spiegelman were there.</t2456> <t2457>Ruthie was still at home.</t2457> <t2458>"Ben!" I shouted.</t2458> <t2459>In the blink of an eye, Ben was outside, and as the Spiegelmans turned from Jefferson Road onto Jefferson Street, we ran outside into the hot and humid morning.</t2459>
<t2460>We walked across Spiegelman's lawn towards their front door.</t2460> <t2461>I rang the doorbell and heard the sound of Myrna Mountweazel's paws on the parquet floor, then she started barking like crazy, staring at us from the side window.</t2461> <t2462>Ruthie opened the door.</t2462> <t2463>She was a sweet girl, probably around eleven years old.</t2463>
<t2464>"Hey, Ruthie."</t2464><t2465></t2465>
<t2466>"Hello Quentin," he said.</t2466>
<t2467>“Hey, are your mom and dad here?</t2467><t2468>”</t2468>
<t2469>“They just left,” he said, “to go to Target.”</t2469> <t2470>Margo's big eyes were in him too, but his were hazel.</t2470> <t2471>He lifted his head and looked at me, his lips pursed with worry.</t2471> <t2472>“Did you meet the police officer?</t2472><t2473>”</t2473>
<t2474>“Yes,” I said.</t2474> <t2475>“He seemed like a good person.</t2475><t2476>”</t2476>
<t2477>“My mom says it feels like Margo went to university early.</t2477><t2478>”</t2478>
<t2479>“Yes,” I said, thinking that the easiest way to solve a mystery is to decide that there is no mystery to solve.</t2479> <t2480>But it was now clear to me that Margo had left clues leading to a mystery.</t2480>
<t2481>“Listen Ruthie, we need to check Margo's room,” I said.</t2481> <t2482>“But the problem is...</t2482> <t2483>this situation is just like when Margo wanted you to do very secret things.</t2483> <t2484>We are in the same situation here.</t2484><t2485>”</t2485>
<t2486>“Margo doesn't like having people in her room,” said Ruthie.</t2486> <t2487>“Except me.</t2487> <t2488>Sometimes my mom too.</t2488><t2489>”</t2489>
<t2490>“But we are his friends.</t2490><t2491>”</t2491>
<t2492>“She doesn't like having her friends in her room either,” said Ruthie.</t2492>
<t2493>I leaned towards her.</t2493> <t2494>“Ruthie, please.</t2494><t2495>”</t2495>
<t2496>“And you don't want me to tell my mom and dad either,” she said.</t2496>
<t2497>“Correct.</t2497><t2498>”</t2498>
<t2499>“Five dollars,” he said.</t2499> <t2500>I was about to bargain with him, but Radar pulled out a five-dollar bill and handed it to him.</t2500> <t2501>“If I see the car on the driveway, I’ll let you know,” Ruthie said as if she were plotting.</t2501>
<t2502>I knelt down to pet the aging but always enthusiastic Myrna Mountweazel, then we ran upstairs to Margo's room.</t2502> <t2503>As I placed my hand on the doorknob, it occurred to me that I hadn't seen the entirety of Margo's room since I was almost ten years old.</t2503>
<t2504>I entered.</t2504> <t2505>It was much more orderly than one would expect from Margo, but her mother had probably just organized everything.</t2505> <t2506>To my right, there was a closet stuffed full of clothes.</t2506> <t2507>Behind the door, there was a shoe rack lined with several dozen shoes, ranging from flat buckle shoes to high heels.</t2507> <t2508>It didn't seem like too many things could be missing from that closet.</t2508>
<t2509>"I'm on the computer," said Radar.</t2509> <t2510>I was fiddling with the shutter.</t2510> <t2511>"The poster is taped," he said.</t2511> <t2512>"Just scotch tape.</t2512> <t2513>It's not something strong.</t2513><t2514>"</t2514>
<t2515>The big surprise was on the wall next to the computer desk: bookshelves filled with records, as tall as me and twice as long.</t2515> <t2516>Hundreds of records.</t2516> <t2517>“John Coltrane’s A Love Supreme is on the turntable,” said Ben.</t2517>
<t2518>“God, it's an amazing album,” said Radar without lifting his head from the computer.</t2518> <t2519>“The girl knows my taste.”</t2519> <t2520>Confused, I looked at Ben, then Ben said, “She was playing the saxophone.”</t2520> <t2521>I nodded.</t2521>
<t2522>Radar, who was still typing something on the computer, said, "I can't believe Q has never heard of Coltrane.</t2522> <t2523>Trane's playing is the most convincing evidence I've encountered of the existence of God," he said.</t2523>
<t2524>I started examining the records.</t2524> <t2525>They were arranged alphabetically by singers, so I scanned with my eyes to look for the G’s.</t2525> <t2526>Dizzy Gillespie, Jimmie Dale Gilmore, Green Day, Guided by Voices, George Harrison.</t2526> <t2527>“It seems like every musician in the world is here except Woody Guthrie,” I said.</t2527> <t2528>Then I went back and started from the A’s.</t2528>
<t2529>I heard Ben say, "All the school books are still here."</t2529> <t2530>"And there are some other books on the nightstand.</t2530> <t2531>No newspapers.</t2531><t2532>"</t2532>
<t2533>I was distracted by Aunt Margo's music collection.</t2533> <t2534>She loved everything, I couldn't even imagine her listening to all these old records.</t2534> <t2535>I had seen her listening to music while running, but I had never suspected this kind of obsession.</t2535> <t2536>I had never heard of most of the bands and was surprised that records were still being produced for the new ones.</t2536>
<t2537>I continued to review the A’s, then moved on to the B’s. After passing by the Beatles, Blind Boys of Alabama, and Blondie, I started to skim faster, too fast to see the back cover of Billy Bragg’s Mermaid Avenue until I got to the Buzzcocks.</t2537> <t2538>I stopped, went back, and pulled out the Billy Bragg record.</t2538> <t2539>There was a photo of rows of houses in a city on the front.</t2539> <t2540>But on the back, Woody Guthrie was looking at me, a cigarette dangling from his lips, holding a guitar that said THIS MACHINE KILLS FASCISTS.</t2540>
<t2541>"Hey," I said.</t2541> <t2542>Ben looked at me.</t2542>
<t2543>“Holy crap,” he said.</t2543> <t2544>“You found it well.”</t2544> <t2545>Radar spun around in his chair and said, “Impressive.</t2545> <t2546>I wonder what's inside?”</t2546>
<t2547>Unfortunately, there was only one record inside.</t2547> <t2548>The record looked exactly like a record.</t2548> <t2549>I placed the record on Margo's record player, finally figured out how to operate it, and lowered the needle.</t2549> <t2550>The voice belonged to a man singing Woody Guthrie songs.</t2550> <t2551>He sang better than Woody Guthrie.</t2551>
<t2552>“What is this, just a crazy coincidence?</t2552><t2553>”</t2553>
<t2554>I was holding the album cover.</t2554> <t2555>“Look,” he said.</t2555> <t2556>He was pointing at the song list.</t2556> <t2557>With a fine-tipped black pen, the song titled Walt Whitman’s Niece was circled.</t2557>
<t2558>“Interesting,” I said.</t2558> <t2559>Margo's mother had said that Margo's clues never led anywhere, but now I knew that Margo had created a chain of clues...</t2559> <t2560>and apparently, she had done it for me.</t2560> <t2561>Right after, I thought about her in the SunTrust building, telling me that I was better when I was confident.</t2561> <t2562>I flipped the record and played it.</t2562> <t2563>Walt Whitman's Niece was the first song on the second side.</t2563> <t2564>It wasn't actually bad.</t2564>
<t2565>At that moment, I saw Ruthie at the doorway.</t2565> <t2566>She looked at me.</t2566> <t2567>“Do you have any clues for us, Ruthie?” She shook her head.</t2567> <t2568>“I already looked,” she said with a sullen face.</t2568> <t2569>Radar looked at me and gestured towards Ruthie with his head.</t2569>
<t2570>“Can you please keep waiting for your mother for us?” I asked.</t2570> <t2571>He nodded and left.</t2571> <t2572>I closed the door.</t2572>
<t2573>“What is it?” I asked Radar.</t2573> <t2574>He called us over to the computer.</t2574> <t2575>“The week before she left, Margo logged into Omnictionary.</t2575> <t2576>I can tell from the minutes she was logged in with her username.</t2576> <t2577>But she cleared her browsing history, so I can’t tell what she looked at.” “Hey Radar, look up who Walt Whitman is,” said Ben.</t2577> <t2578>“He was a poet,” I answered.</t2578> <t2579>“In the nineteenth century.” “Great,” said Ben, rolling his eyes.</t2579> <t2580>“Poetry.</t2580><t2581>”</t2581>
<t2582>"What's the problem with this?" I asked.</t2582>
<t2583>“The poem is too emo,” he said.</t2583> <t2584>“Oh, the pain.</t2584> <t2585>The pain.</t2585> <t2586>It’s constantly raining.</t2586> <t2587>In my soul.</t2587><t2588>”</t2588>
<t2589>“Yes, I think this is Shakespeare,” I said, pretending not to hear him.</t2589> <t2590>“Does Walt Whitman have a nephew?” I asked Radar.</t2590> <t2591>He was already on Whitman’s Omnictionary page.</t2591> <t2592>He was a large, big-bearded man.</t2592> <t2593>I had never read him, but he looked like a good poet.</t2593>
<t2594>“Ah, not a famous person.</t2594> <t2595>It says he has two brothers, but it doesn't mention whether he has children.</t2595> <t2596>I can probably find out, if you want.”</t2596> <t2597>I nodded.</t2597> <t2598>This didn't feel right.</t2598> <t2599>I went back to searching the room.</t2599> <t2600>On the bottom shelf of the record collection, there were some books—middle school yearbooks, a worn-out copy of The Outsiders—and some old issues of youth magazines.</t2600> <t2601>There was nothing about Walt Whitman's nephew.</t2601>
<t2602>I glanced through the books in the nightstand.</t2602> <t2603>There was nothing interesting.</t2603> <t2604>“If there were a book of Whitman's poetry, it would make sense,” I said.</t2604> <t2605>“But it doesn't seem like there is one.</t2605><t2606>”</t2606>
<t2607>“There is!” Ben said excitedly.</t2607> <t2608>I saw it when I went to the spot where he was kneeling in front of the bookshelf.</t2608> <t2609>I had missed the thin volume wedged between the two-year-old books on the bottom shelf.</t2609> <t2610>Walt Whitman.</t2610> <t2611>Leaves of Grass.</t2611> <t2612>I pulled the book out.</t2612> <t2613>There was a photo of Whitman on the cover, his bright eyes looking at me.</t2613>
<t2614>"Not bad," I said to Ben.</t2614>
<t2615>He nodded.</t2615> <t2616>“Yes, can we leave now?</t2616> <t2617>You can call me old-fashioned, but I would prefer not to be here when Margo's parents return.</t2617><t2618>”</t2618>
<t2619>“Is there something we missed?</t2619><t2620>”</t2620>
<t2621>Radar stood up.</t2621> <t2622>“It really seems to be drawing quite a straight line; there must be something in that book.</t2622> <t2623>Strange, though...</t2623> <t2624>I mean, sorry, but if she always left clues for her parents, why would she leave one for you this time?</t2624><t2625>”</t2625>
<t2626>I shrugged.</t2626> <t2627>I didn't know the answer, but of course, I had hopes: Maybe Margo needed to see my trust.</t2627> <t2628>Maybe this time she wanted to be found by me.</t2628> <t2629>Maybe...</t2629> <t2630>just as she chose me on that long night, she had chosen me again.</t2630> <t2631>And maybe unknown treasures awaited the person who found her.</t2631>
<t2632>Ben and Radar left shortly after we returned home; neither of them had found any obvious clues while skimming through the book.</t2632> <t2633>I grabbed some cold lasagna from the fridge for lunch and went to my room with Walt.</t2633> <t2634>It was the first edition of the Penguin Classics version of Leaves of Grass.</t2634> <t2635>I read a piece from the introduction, then flipped through the pages of the book.</t2635> <t2636>There were many lines underlined in blue, all from the epic-length poem called Song of Myself.</t2636> <t2637>And there were two lines underlined in green in the poem:</t2637>
<t2638>Remove the locks from the doors!</t2638>
<t2639>Remove the doors from their frames!</t2639>
<t2640>I spent most of my afternoon trying to make sense of this phrase, thinking that maybe it was Margo's way of telling me to become a tougher kid or something.</t2640> <t2641>But I also read everything underlined in blue over and over again:</t2641>
<t2642>You should no longer get events secondhand or thirdhand...</t2642>
<t2643>you must neither look through the eyes of the dead...</t2643> <t2644>nor feed on the whispers in books.</t2644>
<t2645>I am slowly progressing on an eternal journey</t2645>
<t2646>Everything flows forward and outward... and nothing is spoiled, And dying is different and more fortunate than everyone assumes.</t2646>
<t2647>I will be content if no one in the world notices, And I will be content if each and every one of them does.</t2647>
<t2648>The last three stanzas of "My Own Song" were also underlined.</t2648>
<t2649>I leave myself to grow from the grass I love into the soil, If you want me again, look for me under your soles.</t2649>
<t2650>You will barely know who I am or what I mean, Yet I must be healthy for you,</t2650>
<t2651>And I must drain and nourish with its blood.</t2651>
<t2652>If you fail to bring me back the first time, protect your courage,</t2652>
<t2653>If you miss me somewhere, look for me elsewhere,</t2653>
<t2654>I am standing somewhere, waiting for you</t2654>
<t2655>The weekend was spent reading, trying to see her in the fragments of poetry she left behind for me.</t2655> <t2656>I wasn't getting anywhere with the verses, but I kept thinking about them because I didn't want to disappoint her.</t2656> <t2657>She wanted me to pull all the strings, find the place where she was waiting for me, and follow the traces she left from the breadcrumb trails until there was no other way out but her.</t2657>
<t2658>An extraordinary event occurred on Monday morning.</t2658> <t2659>I was late, that was normal; then my mom dropped me off at school, that was normal; then I stood outside for a while talking to everyone, that was normal; then Ben and Radar headed inside, that was also normal.</t2659> <t2660>But as soon as we pulled open the steel door, Ben's face took on a mixture of panic and excitement...</t2660> <t2661>as if a magician had just picked him out of the crowd to perform a sawing-in-half trick.</t2661> <t2662>I followed his gaze down the corridor.</t2662>
<t2663>Denim mini skirt.</t2663> <t2664>Tight white t-shirt.</t2664> <t2665>Low neckline.</t2665> <t2666>Unusually tan skin.</t2666> <t2667>Legs that make you notice legs.</t2667> <t2668>Perfectly styled curly, brown hair.</t2668> <t2669>A badge that says PROM QUEEN AS ME.</t2669> <t2670>Lacey Pemberton.</t2670> <t2671>She was walking towards us.</t2671> <t2672>Next to the band room.</t2672>
<t2673>"Lacey Pemberton," Ben whispered, even though Lacey was only about three steps away from us and could clearly hear him, and indeed, upon hearing her name, a fake smile quickly appeared and disappeared on her face.</t2673>
<t2674>“Quentin,” she said to me, and first of all, I found it incredible that she knew my name.</t2674> <t2675>She nodded and I followed her past the band room towards the lockers.</t2675> <t2676>She matched my pace.</t2676>
<t2677>"Hi, Lacey," I said when she stopped.</t2677> <t2678>I could smell her perfume, and I remembered the scent from her car, just like with Margo</t2678>
<t2679>Like I remember the sound the catfish made when we lowered your chair to the ground.</t2679>
<t2680>“I heard you were with Margo.</t2680><t2681>”</t2681>
<t2682>I just looked at her.</t2682>
<t2683>“That night, you know, during the fish incident?</t2683> <t2684>In my car? And in Becca’s closet? At Jase’s window?</t2684><t2685>”</t2685>
<t2686>I kept looking.</t2686> <t2687>I wasn't sure what to say; one could live a long and adventurous life without ever talking to Lacey Pemberton, and when faced with this rare opportunity, you wouldn't want to misrepresent yourself.</t2687> <t2688>So Ben spoke for me.</t2688> <t2689>"Yeah, they're hooked," he said, as if we were tight with Margo.</t2689>
<t2690>“Was he angry with me?” Lacey asked shortly after.</t2690> <t2691>She was looking down; I could see her brown eye shadow.</t2691>
<t2692>“What?</t2692><t2693>”</t2693>
<t2694>Then she spoke quietly, her voice cracked a little, and suddenly it was as if Lacey Pemberton was not Lacey Pemberton.</t2694> <t2695>She was a complete...</t2695> <t2696>human being.</t2696> <t2697>“Was she, you know, angry about something?”</t2697> <t2698>I thought for a while about how to answer this.</t2698> <t2699>“Oh, she was a bit disappointed that you didn't tell her anything about Jase and Becca, but you know Margo.</t2699> <t2700>She'll get over it.</t2700><t2701>”</t2701>
<t2702>Lacey started to move down the corridor.</t2702> <t2703>We allowed her to go with Ben, but then she slowed down.</t2703> <t2704>She wanted us to walk with her.</t2704> <t2705>Ben nudged me with his elbow and we started walking together.</t2705> <t2706>“I didn’t even know Jase and Becca.</t2706> <t2707>That’s the point.</t2707> <t2708>God, I hope I can explain this to her soon.</t2708> <t2709>For a while, I was worried she might really be gone, but then I checked her locker, because I know the combination, and all her pictures and stuff are still there, all her books piled up.”</t2709> <t2710>“That’s good,” I said.</t2710>
<t2711>“Yes, but it has been about four days.</t2711> <t2712>This is almost a record for him.</t2712> <t2713>And this is really a terrible situation because Craig knew, and I was so mad at him for not telling me that I broke up with him and</t2713>
<t2714>"Now I don't have a ball escort, and my best friend is somewhere, in New York or something, thinking that I did something I would NEVER do."</t2714> <t2715>I glanced at Ben.</t2715> <t2716>Ben glanced at me too.</t2716>
<t2717>“I need to get to class,” I said.</t2717> <t2718>“But why do you say it's in New York?</t2718><t2719>”</t2719>
<t2720>“I think he told Jase, like two days before he left, that New York is the only place in America where a person can really live a decent life.</t2720> <t2721>Maybe he was just saying it.</t2721> <t2722>I don't know.</t2722><t2723>”</t2723>
<t2724>“Okay, I have to go,” I said.</t2724>
<t2725>I knew that Ben could never convince Lacey to go to the prom with him, but I thought he at least deserved a chance.</t2725> <t2726>As I was running through the corridors towards my locker, I patted Radar on the head as I passed by him.</t2726> <t2727>He was talking to Angela and a freshman girl from the band.</t2727> <t2728>To the freshman girl, he said, “Don’t thank me.</t2728> <t2729>Thank Q,” I heard him say, and then the girl shouted, “Thanks for the two hundred dollars!”</t2729> <t2730>Without looking back, I shouted, “Don’t thank me, thank Margo Roth Spiegelman!” after all, she was the one who gave me the tools I needed.</t2730>
<t2731>I reached my locker and took my math notebook, but even after the second bell rang, I just stood there, motionless in the middle of the corridor as people rushed past me in both directions as if I were the median strip in their path.</t2731> <t2732>Another kid thanked me for the two hundred dollars.</t2732> <t2733>I smiled.</t2733> <t2734>The school felt more like mine than it had during the four years I had been there.</t2734> <t2735>We had provided some justice for the band geeks without bikes.</t2735> <t2736>Lacey Pemberton had talked to me.</t2736> <t2737>Chuck Parson had apologized.</t2737>
<t2738>I knew these corridors so well... and eventually, it felt like they were starting to know me too.</t2738> <t2739>I stood there as the crowd gradually thinned out when the third bell rang.</t2739> <t2740>But later</t2740>
<t2741>I entered math class and sat down in my seat right after Mr. Jiminez started another endless lesson.</t2741>
<t2742>I had brought Margo's Leaves of Grass to school, and while Mr. Jiminez was scribbling something on the board, I started rereading the underlined sections of Song of Myself under the desk.</t2742> <t2743>As far as I could see, there was no direct reference to New York.</t2743> <t2744>A few minutes later, I handed the book to Radar, and before writing a note on the corner of his notebook closest to me, he looked at the book for a while.</t2744> <t2745>Those marked in green must mean something.</t2745> <t2746>Maybe it wants you to open the door of your mind?</t2746> <t2747>I shrugged and in response, wrote, Maybe he read the poem on two different days with two different pens.</t2747>
<t2748>A few minutes later, while looking at the clock for only the thirty-seventh time, I saw Ben Starling standing outside the classroom door, doing a silly dance with a permission slip in his hand.</t2748>
<t2749>When the lunch bell rang, I ran to my locker, but somehow Ben had beaten me there, and somehow he was talking to Lacey Pemberton.</t2749> <t2750>He was leaning towards Lacey, almost climbing on top of her to talk to her face.</t2750> <t2751>Talking to Ben sometimes made me feel claustrophobic, and I wasn't even a sexy girl.</t2751> <t2752>"Hey, guys," I said when I reached them.</t2752>
<t2753>“Hi,” Lacey responded, taking a noticeable step back from Ben.</t2753> <t2754>“Ben was giving me the latest updates about Margo.</t2754> <t2755>You know, no one had entered her room.</t2755> <t2756>She used to say that her parents didn’t allow her to bring friends over.”</t2756> <t2757>“Really?” Lacey nodded.</t2757> <t2758>“Did you know that Margo had about a thousand records?</t2758><t2759>”</t2759>
<t2760>Lacey raised her hands.</t2760> <t2761>“No, I was saying that too!</t2761> <t2762>Margo never talked about music.</t2762> <t2763>I mean, she would say she liked something on the radio or whatever.</t2763> <t2764>But... no.</t2764> <t2765>Is Margo very strange?</t2765><t2766>’</t2766>
<t2767>I shrugged my shoulders.</t2767> <t2768>Maybe Margo was weird or the rest of us were weird.</t2768> <t2769>Lacey kept talking.</t2769> <t2770>“But we were just talking about how Walt Whitman was from New York.</t2770><t2771>”</t2771>
<t2772>"And according to Omnictionary, Woody Guthrie also lived there for a long time," said Ben.</t2772>
<t2773>I nodded my head.</t2773> <t2774>“I can imagine Margo in New York.</t2774> <t2775>Still, we need to solve the next clue.</t2775> <t2776>I don't think it ends with the book.</t2776> <t2777>There must be some kind of code in the underlined lines.</t2777><t2778>”</t2778>
<t2779>“Yes, can I look at the book during lunch?</t2779><t2780>”</t2780>
<t2781>“Of course,” I said.</t2781> <t2782>“Or if you prefer, I can make a copy for you in the library.</t2782><t2783>”</t2783>
<t2784>No, just reading is enough.</t2784> <t2785>I mean, I don't know anything about poetry.</t2785> <t2786>Ah, whatever...</t2786> <t2787>I have a cousin there, at New York University, I sent him a flyer that he can print out.</t2787> <t2788>I'll tell him to post the flyers in music stores.</t2788> <t2789>I mean, I know there are a lot of music stores there, but still...</t2789><t2790>”</t2790>
<t2791>“Good idea,” I said.</t2791> <t2792>They started walking towards the cafeteria, and I followed them.</t2792>
<t2793>Ben called out, "Hey, Acey, what color is your dress?"</t2793><t2794>"</t2794>
<t2795>“Hmm, like a sapphire, why?”</t2795><t2796>”</t2796>
<t2797>“I just wanted to make sure my tuxedo would fit,” said Ben.</t2797> <t2798>I had never seen Ben's smile so cheesy and ridiculous, and this was really an important detail because Ben was normally quite a cheesy and ridiculous person.</t2798>
<t2799>Lacey nodded.</t2799> <t2800>“Okay, but we don't want to be too conventional.</t2800> <t2801>Maybe you can go traditional: Black tuxedo with a black vest?</t2801><t2802>”</t2802>
<t2803>"Should I wear a sash?"</t2803><t2804>"</t2804>
<t2805>“Well, that would be fine, but it would be better if you didn't buy the ones with really thick pleats.</t2805><t2806>”</t2806>
<t2807>They kept talking, apparently, the ideal thickness of the battery was a topic that could be discussed for hours, but Pizza Hut</t2807>
<t2808>I had stopped listening while waiting.</t2808> <t2809>I had found my prom date, and Lacey had found a guy to talk about the prom with for hours, contentedly.</t2809> <t2810>Now everyone had a date...</t2810> <t2811>except me, and I wasn't going to the prom.</t2811> <t2812>The only girl I would want to take was slowly advancing on some kind of eternal journey.</t2812>
<t2813>When we sat down, Lacey started reading My Song and agreed that none of them resembled anything, and certainly not Margo.</t2813> <t2814>We still didn't know what Margo was trying to tell us, if she was trying to say anything at all.</t2814> <t2815>Lacey handed the book back to me and they started talking about the prom again.</t2815>
<t2816>All afternoon, I kept feeling like there was no point in looking at the underlined words, but then I got bored and reached into my back pocket, put the book on my lap, and went back to looking at the lines.</t2816> <t2817>At the end of the day, we had literature class in the seventh period and we were just starting to read Moby Dick, so Dr. Holden was talking quite a bit about fishing in the nineteenth century.</t2817> <t2818>I held Moby Dick on my desk and Whitman on my lap, but even being in literature class didn't help.</t2818> <t2819>For the first time, I went on for a few minutes without looking at the clock, so when the bell rang, I was surprised, and it took me longer than everyone else to gather my backpack.</t2819> <t2820>As I slung my bag over one shoulder and walked out, Dr. Holden smiled at me and said, "So, Walt Whitman."</t2820>
<t2821>I nodded my head in an embarrassed manner.</t2821>
<t2822>“Good book,” he said.</t2822> <t2823>“So good that reading it in class is almost not a problem for me.</t2823> <t2824>Almost.”</t2824> <t2825>“I'm sorry,” I murmured, then went out to the senior parking lot.</t2825>
<t2826>While I was in the band with Radar, I sat in SESIB with the doors open; a light, cool breeze was blowing.</t2826> <t2827>To prepare for my political science exam the next day, I read some of the Federalist Papers.</t2827>
<t2828>I read it, but my mind kept getting stuck in its endless loop: Guthrie, Whitman, New York, and Margo.</t2828> <t2829>Had he gone to New York to bury himself in folk music?</t2829> <t2830>Was there a Margo who loved folk music that I didn't know about?</t2830> <t2831>Maybe he was staying in a house where they once lived?</t2831> <t2832>And why did he want to tell me this?</t2832>
<t2833>I saw Ben and Radar approaching from the window, Radar was swinging his saxophone case as he walked quickly towards SESIB.</t2833> <t2834>They hurriedly got into the car through the already open door, Ben turned the ignition and SESIB sputtered, we hoped, it sputtered again, we hoped a bit more, and finally it coughed to life.</t2834> <t2835>Ben first quickly drove out of the parking lot and away from the school, then he shouted at me: "CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS NONSENSE!" He couldn't contain his joy.</t2835>
<t2836>He started hitting the car horn, but of course, the horn didn't work, so he shouted every time he hit it: "BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! IF LOYAL BUNNY LACEY PEMBERTON IS GOING TO THE PROM WITH YOU, HONK! HONK, SWEETIE, HONK!</t2836><t2837>"</t2837>
<t2838>On the way home, Ben almost couldn't shut his mouth.</t2838> <t2839>"Do you know why that is?</t2839> <t2840>Besides the desperation, I mean.</t2840> <t2841>I think he's fighting with Becca Arrington because Becca is being sneaky and all that Bloody Ben stuff is making him feel bad.</t2841> <t2842>He didn't say it, but he kind of acted that way.</t2842> <t2843>So in the end, Bloody Ben is going to bring me some toys." Okay, I was happy for Ben, but I wanted to focus on the game of reaching Margo.</t2843>
<t2844>"Children, do you have any ideas?"</t2844><t2845>"</t2845>
<t2846>There was a moment of silence, then Radar looked at me through the rearview mirror.</t2846> <t2847>"That door thing is the only one marked differently from the others, and also the most random one; I really think the one with the clue is that one."</t2847> <t2848>By the way, what was it?</t2848><t2849>"</t2849>
<t2850>"Remove the locks from the doors!</t2850> <t2851>/ Remove the doors from their frames!" I replied.</t2851>
<t2852>Radar said, "Undoubtedly, Jefferson Park is not the best place to pry open the doors of narrow-mindedness."</t2852> <t2853>"Maybe that's what Margo meant.</t2853> <t2854>Like that paper town thing she said about Orlando?</t2854> <t2855>Maybe she's saying that's why she left."</t2855> <t2856>I slowed down because of the red light, then turned around to look at Radar.</t2856> <t2857>"Brother," he said, "I think you kids are giving too much credit to Margo's rabbit trails.</t2857><t2858>"</t2858>
<t2859>“What do you mean?” I asked.</t2859>
<t2860>“Remove the locks from the doors,” he said.</t2860> <t2861>“Remove the doors from their frames.” “Yes,” I said.</t2861> <t2862>The light turned green and Ben stepped on the gas.</t2862> <t2863>SESIB rattled as if it was going to fall apart, but then it started to move.</t2863>
<t2864>“This is not a poem.</t2864> <t2865>It is not a metaphor.</t2865> <t2866>These are instructions.</t2866> <t2867>We need to go to Margo's room, remove the lock from the door, and take the door off its hinges.”</t2867> <t2868>Radar looked at me through the rearview mirror, and I looked back at him.</t2868> <t2869>“Sometimes,” Radar said to me, “she is so idiotic that she turns into a diamond.</t2869><t2870>”</t2870>
<t2871>After parking on our driveway, we crossed the lawn that separated Margo's house from mine, just like we did on Saturday.</t2871> <t2872>Ruthie opened the door and said that her parents wouldn't be home until six; Myrna Mountweazel ran around us excitedly in circles; we went upstairs.</t2872> <t2873>Ruthie brought us a toolbox from the garage, then we all stared at the door leading to Margo's room for a while.</t2873> <t2874>We were not handy people.</t2874>
<t2875>“Damn, it's a hellish job,” said Ben.</t2875>
<t2876>"Don't swear in front of Ruthie," I said.</t2876>
<t2877>“Ruthie, would it be a problem for you if I said hell?</t2877><t2878>”</t2878>
<t2879>“We don't believe in hell,” he replied.</t2879>
<t2880>Radar intervened.</t2880> <t2881>"Folks," he said.</t2881> <t2882>"Folks.</t2882> <t2883>The door." He rummaged through the messy toolbox, pulled out a Phillips screwdriver, and knelt down, removing the door handle where the lock was.</t2883> <t2884>I tried to take a larger screwdriver to remove the hinges, but there didn't seem to be any screws.</t2884> <t2885>I looked at the door a bit more.</t2885> <t2886>Finally, Ruthie got bored and went downstairs to watch TV.</t2886>
<t2887>Radar loosened the door handle and each of us, in turn, carefully looked inside the unpainted, unpolished wood around the handle.</t2887> <t2888>There was no message.</t2888> <t2889>There was no note.</t2889> <t2890>Feeling frustrated, I continued to work on the hinges, wondering how to open it, opening and closing the door to understand its mechanism.</t2890> <t2891>"That poem is so long," I said,</t2891>
<t2892>"One thinks that old Walt would at least spare a line or two to tell us how to remove the door from its frame."</t2892><t2893>"</t2893>
<t2894>I only realized Radar was sitting at Margo's computer when he responded to me.</t2894> <t2895>“According to Omnictionary,” he said, “we are looking at a door hinge.</t2895> <t2896>And you are using the screwdriver as a lever to remove the hinge.</t2896> <t2897>By chance, I discovered that a vandal wrote that the door hinges are strong because they are reinforced with farts.</t2897> <t2898>Ah, Omnictionary.</t2898> <t2899>Will you ever provide complete information?</t2899><t2900>”</t2900>
<t2901>As soon as Omnictionary told us what to do, it turned out to be surprisingly easy to do.</t2901> <t2902>I removed the door from its three hinges, then Ben separated the door.</t2902> <t2903>I examined the hinges and the unfinished wood of the door frame.</t2903> <t2904>There was nothing.</t2904>
<t2905>"There's nothing at the door," said Ben.</t2905> <t2906>Ben and I put the door back in place and Radar secured the hinges with the back of the screwdriver.</t2906>
<t2907>We went to Ben's house, which had the same architecture as mine, to play a game called Polar Fury with radar.</t2907> <t2908>It was in the style of a "game within a game" where players hit each other with paintballs on top of a glacier.</t2908> <t2909>You didn't get extra points for hitting the opponent in the groin.</t2909> <t2910>It was really very complicated.</t2910> <t2911>"Dude, Margo is definitely in New York," said Ben.</t2911> <t2912>I saw the tip of his gun coming from around a corner, but before I could move, he hit me between my legs.</t2912> <t2913>"Damn it," I grumbled.</t2913>
<t2914>Radar, "In the past, clues seemed to point to a place.</t2914> <t2915>He tells Jase; they leave us clues about two people who have spent most of their lives in New York.</t2915> <t2916>It sounds logical," he said.</t2916>
<t2917>Ben said, "Buddy, that's what he wants."</t2917> <t2918>He stopped the game just as he was crawling towards Ben.</t2918> <t2919>"He wants you to go to New York.</t2919> <t2920>What if he set this up as the only way to find him?</t2920> <t2921>To actually go.</t2921><t2922>"</t2922>
<t2923>“What? That place is a city with a population of about ten million.</t2923><t2924>”</t2924>
<t2925>“There might be a mole here,” said Radar.</t2925> <t2926>“If you go, there will be someone to tell him this.</t2926><t2927>”</t2927>
<t2928>“Lacey!” said Ben.</t2928> <t2929>“This is definitely Lacey.</t2929> <t2930>Yes! You should get on a plane and go to New York immediately.</t2930> <t2931>And when Lacey finds out, Margo will pick you up from the airport.</t2931> <t2932>Yes.</t2932> <t2933>Brother, I will take you to your house, you will pack your things, then I will drive your ass to the airport and you will buy a plane ticket with the credit card you keep on the side just for emergencies, and then when Margo realizes what a tough kid you are, the kind of tough kid Jase Worthington can only dream of being, the three of us will be taking sexy girls to the prom.</t2933><t2934>”</t2934>
<t2935>I had no doubt that there was a plane going to New York in a short time.</t2935> <t2936>From Orlando, there is a plane going everywhere in a short time.</t2936> <t2937>But I had doubts about everything else.</t2937> <t2938>“If you call Lacey...” I said.</t2938>
<t2939>“He will not confess!” said Ben.</t2939> <t2940>‘Think about all the misdirections they made...</t2940> <t2941>They probably just pretended to be fighting so you wouldn't suspect he was the mole.</t2941><t2942>”</t2942>
<t2943>Radar said, "I don't know, it really doesn't seem reasonable."</t2943> <t2944>He continued talking, but I wasn't really listening to him.</t2944> <t2945>I pondered while staring at the frozen screen.</t2945> <t2946>If Margo and Lacey were pretending to fight, had Lacey also pretended to break up with her boyfriend?</t2946> <t2947>Was her concern also fake?</t2947> <t2948>Lacey was responding to dozens of emails—none of which contained any real information—in response to the flyers her cousin had put up in music stores in New York.</t2948> <t2949>She wasn't a mole or anything, and Ben's plan was stupid.</t2949> <t2950>Still, I liked that there was at least a plan.</t2950> <t2951>But there were only two and a half weeks left until school ended, and if I went to New York, I would miss at least two days...</t2951> <t2952>Not to mention that my mom and dad would kill me for buying a plane ticket with my credit card.</t2952> <t2953>The more I thought about it, the more foolish it seemed.</t2953>
<t2954>was tiring.</t2954> <t2955>Still, if I could see Margo tomorrow...</t2955> <t2956>But no.</t2956> <t2957>"I can't skip school," I said finally.</t2957> <t2958>I restarted the game.</t2958> <t2959>"I have a French exam tomorrow.</t2959><t2960>"</t2960>
<t2961>"Your romanticism is truly inspiring," said Ben.</t2961>
<t2962>I played for a few more minutes, then walked home by crossing Jefferson Park.</t2962>
<t2963>Once, my mother told me about a crazy child she had to work with.</t2963> <t2964>He was a completely normal child until the age of nine, when his father died.</t2964> <t2965>Probably, many nine-year-old children had many deceased fathers, and most of the time, the children did not go crazy, but I guess this child was an exception.</t2965>
<t2966>In the end, he did something like this: He took one of those steel compasses with a pencil and started drawing circles on a piece of paper.</t2966> <t2967>All the circles were exactly two centimeters in diameter.</t2967> <t2968>He would draw circles until the entire paper was black, then take another paper and draw more circles, and he did this continuously every day.</t2968> <t2969>He wasn't paying attention in classes and was drawing circles all over his exam papers and such, and my mom said that the child's problem was that the routine he created to cope with his loss had become destructive.</t2969> <t2970>So anyway, then my mom made him cry for his father or something, and the kid stopped drawing circles and apparently lived happily ever after.</t2970> <t2971>But sometimes I think about the circle kid because I kind of understand him.</t2971> <t2972>I've always liked routine.</t2972> <t2973>I guess I've never found boredom boring.</t2973> <t2974>I wasn't sure if I could explain this to someone like Margo, but in life, drawing circles left me with the impression of a reasonable kind of madness.</t2974>
<t2975>That's why I should have felt good about not going to New York...</t2975> <t2976>After all, it was a foolish idea.</t2976> <t2977>But that night and the next day, as I moved through my own routine, it ate me up, as if the routine itself was pulling me further away from reaching it.</t2977>
<t2978>On Tuesday evening, six days after she had left, I talked to my parents.</t2978> <t2979>It wasn't a big decision or anything; I just talked.</t2979> <t2980>While my dad was chopping vegetables and my mom was frying steak in the pan, I was sitting on the kitchen counter.</t2980> <t2981>My dad was heavily criticizing me for taking so much time to read such a short book, and I said, "Actually, it's not for literature; I think Margo left it for me to find her."</t2981> <t2982>They fell silent, then I told them about Woody Guthrie and Whitman.</t2982>
<t2983>“It's clear that he enjoys playing such games with incomplete information,” said my father.</t2983>
<t2984>“I can't blame her for wanting attention,” said my mother, then added, looking at me: “But that doesn't make her well-being your responsibility.</t2984><t2985>”</t2985>
<t2986>My father scraped the carrots and onions into the pan.</t2986> <t2987>"Yes, it's true, maybe neither of us can diagnose without seeing him, but I think he'll be home soon.</t2987><t2988>"</t2988>
<t2989>“We shouldn't make assumptions,” my mother said quietly, as if I couldn't hear them.</t2989> <t2990>My father was about to respond, but I intervened.</t2990>
<t2991>“What should I do?</t2991><t2992>”</t2992>
<t2993>“Graduate,” said my mother.</t2993> <t2994>“And believe that Margo can take care of herself, she shows a remarkable talent in this regard.</t2994><t2995>”</t2995>
<t2996>"I agree," said my father, but after dinner, when I went back to my room to play Resurrection in silence, I could hear them whispering.</t2996> <t2997>I couldn't hear the words, but I could feel the anxiety.</t2997>
<t2998>That night, in the later hours, Ben called my cell phone.</t2998>
<t2999>"Hey," I said.</t2999>
<t3000>“My brother,” he said.</t3000>
<t3001>“Yes,” I replied.</t3001>
<t3002>“I'm about to go shoe shopping with Lacey.</t3002><t3003>”</t3003>
<t3004>“Shoe shopping?</t3004><t3005>”</t3005>
<t3006>“Yes.</t3006> <t3007>Everything is thirty percent off from ten o'clock to midnight.</t3007> <t3008>She wants me to help her choose prom shoes.</t3008> <t3009>So, she has a few shoes but I was at her place yesterday and they are not quite...</t3009> <t3010>anyway, in the end, you want the perfect shoes for the prom.</t3010> <t3011>So she will return them, then we will go to Burdines and do the thing...</t3011><t3012>”</t3012>
<t3013>“Me,” I said.</t3013>
<t3014>"Yes?"</t3014>
<t3015>“Dude, I don't want to talk about Lacey's prom shoes.</t3015> <t3016>And let me tell you why: I have something that makes me not care about prom shoes.</t3016> <t3017>It's called a penis.</t3017><t3018>”</t3018>
<t3019>“I’m really nervous and I can't stop thinking that I really like him, not just as a ‘sexy prom date,’ but more like ‘he's actually really cool and I enjoy hanging out with him.’</t3019> <t3020>And I don't know, maybe we'll go to the prom, kiss in the middle of the dance floor or something, and everyone will be like oh my God or whatever, and everything they think about me will just fly out the window...</t3020><t3021>”</t3021>
<t3022>“Ben,” I said.</t3022> <t3023>“If you stop babbling foolishly, everything will go as it should.”</t3023> <t3024>He continued talking for a while longer, but we were finally able to hang up the phone.</t3024>
<t3025>I lay down and started to feel sad about the prom.</t3025> <t3026>I was rejecting any kind of sadness about the fact that I didn't go to the prom, but foolishly, embarrassingly, I thought about finding Margo and convincing her to come home just in time for the prom, like late Saturday night, then we'd walk into the Hilton's ballroom in jeans and messy t-shirts, just in time for the last dance, and everyone would point at us and marvel at Margo's return while we danced, then we'd foxtrot until we wore the place out and go to Friendly's for ice cream.</t3026> <t3027>So yes, like Ben, I was having ridiculous prom fantasies.</t3027> <t3028>But at least I wasn't saying mine out loud.</t3028>
<t3029>Sometimes I was such a selfish fool that I had to remind myself why I still loved him.</t3029> <t3030>At least sometimes he had surprisingly brilliant ideas.</t3030> <t3031>The door incident was a good idea.</t3031> <t3032>It hadn't worked, but it was a good idea.</t3032> <t3033>But clearly, Margo intended it to mean something else to me.</t3033>
<t3034>To me.</t3034>
<t3035>The clue was mine.</t3035> <t3036>The doors were mine!</t3036>
<t3037>While going to the garage, I had to pass through the living room where my mom and dad were watching TV.</t3037> <t3038>“Would you like to watch?” my mom asked.</t3038> <t3039>“They are about to solve the case.”</t3039> <t3040>It was one of those crime-solving shows.</t3040>
<t3041>“No, thanks,” I said and breezed past them from the kitchen to the garage.</t3041> <t3042>I found the largest flathead screwdriver, then tucked it into the belt of my khaki shorts and tightened my belt.</t3042> <t3043>I grabbed a cookie from the kitchen, passed through the living room again, my walking style must have looked slightly odd, and they were engrossed in the unraveling mystery on the television.</t3043>
<t3044>While they were following the tracks, I removed three hinges from my room's door.</t3044> <t3045>When the last one came out, the door creaked and started to fall, so I leaned it against the wall with one hand and fully opened it. As I pushed the door, I saw a tiny piece of paper, roughly the size of my thumbnail, fluttering down from the top hinge of the door.</t3045> <t3046>Typical Margo.</t3046> <t3047>Why would she hide something in her own room when she could have hidden it in mine?</t3047> <t3048>I wondered when she did this...</t3048> <t3049>how she got inside.</t3049> <t3050>I couldn't help but smile.</t3050>
<t3051>Orlando Sentinel newspaper was a part of it, the edges were crooked and it was a bit torn.</t3051> <t3052>I understood it was Sentinel because on a torn edge it said "do Sentinel May 6,2."</t3052> <t3053>The day Margo left.</t3053> <t3054>The message was definitely from her.</t3054> <t3055>I recognized her handwriting.</t3055>
<t3056>8328 Bartlesville Street</t3056>
<t3057>I couldn't put the door back in place without fitting the hinges with the screwdriver, which would definitely alert my parents, so I just leaned the door against the hinges and left it completely open.</t3057> <t3058>I went to my computer and searched for a map of 8328 Bartlesville Street.</t3058> <t3059>I had never heard of this street.</t3059>
<t3060>55.</t3060> <t3061>It was 6 kilometers away, all the way on Colonial Boulevard, almost near Florida, in the vicinity of Christmas Town.</t3061> <t3062>When I zoomed in on the satellite image of the building, it looked like a black rectangle with a matte silver area on its front facade, and a grass-arranged back facade.</t3062> <t3063>Maybe it was a caravan.</t3063> <t3064>It was very difficult to understand the scale because it was surrounded by so much greenery.</t3064>
<t3065>I called Ben and explained the situation.</t3065> <t3066>“So I was right!” he said.</t3066> <t3067>“I can't wait to tell Lacey, because she also thought it was a really good idea!</t3067><t3068>”</t3068>
<t3069>I ignored Lacey's comment.</t3069> <t3070>“I think I'll go,” I said.</t3070>
<t3071>“Well, yes, of course you should go.</t3071> <t3072>I'm coming too.</t3072> <t3073>Let's go on Sunday morning.</t3073> <t3074>I will be tired from the ball that will last all night, but it's okay.</t3074><t3075>”</t3075>
<t3076>“No, I meant to say that I am leaving tonight,” I said.</t3076>
<t3077>“Brother, it is dark outside.</t3077> <t3078>You can't go to an unfamiliar building with a mysterious address in the dark.</t3078> <t3079>Have you never watched a horror movie?</t3079><t3080>”</t3080>
<t3081>“Margo might be there,” I said.</t3081>
<t3082>“Yes, and there might also be a demon that feeds only on the pancreases of young children,” he said.</t3082> <t3083>“My God, at least wait until noon, although I need to order Lacey's corsage after the band, and then I want to be home in case Lacey messages me online because we text a lot...</t3083><t3084>”</t3084>
<t3085>I interrupted him.</t3085> <t3086>“No, tonight.</t3086> <t3087>I want to see him.”</t3087> <t3088>I could feel the circle tightening.</t3088> <t3089>If I hurried, I could be looking at him within an hour.</t3089>
<t3090>“Brother, I am not allowing you to go to a suspicious address in the middle of the night.</t3090> <t3091>If necessary, I'll give you an electric shock on your butt.</t3091><t3092>”</t3092>
<t3093>“Tomorrow morning,” I said, more to myself.</t3093> <t3094>“I will leave tomorrow morning.”</t3094> <t3095>I was tired of my perfect attendance at school anyway.</t3095> <t3096>I was silent.</t3096> <t3097>I heard him blow air through his teeth.</t3097>
<t3098>“I feel like I've caught something,” he said.</t3098> <t3099>“Fever.</t3099> <t3100>Cough.</t3100> <t3101>Pains.</t3101> <t3102>Aches.” I smiled.</t3102> <t3103>After hanging up, I called Radar.</t3103>
<t3104>“I am talking to Ben on the other line,” she said.</t3104> <t3105>“Let me call you back.</t3105><t3106>”</t3106>
<t3107>He called a minute later.</t3107> <t3108>Before I could even say hello, Radar said, "Q, my terrible migraine has started.</t3108> <t3109>It's impossible for me to go to school tomorrow," he said.</t3109> <t3110>I laughed.</t3110>
<t3111>After hanging up the phone, I stripped down to a t-shirt and boxers, emptied my trash can into a drawer, and placed the can next to the bed.</t3111> <t3112>I set my alarm for a damn early hour, six o'clock, and spent the next few hours trying to sleep in vain.</t3112>
<t3113>The next morning, my mother entered my room and said, "You didn't even close the door last night, sleepyhead." I opened my eyes and said, "I think I got food poisoning from something I ate."</t3113> <t3114>Then I pointed to the trash can with vomit in it.</t3114>
<t3115>“Quentin! Oh, my God.</t3115> <t3116>When did this happen?</t3116><t3117>”</t3117>
<t3118>“Around six,” I said, which was true.</t3118>
<t3119>"Why didn't you come to us?</t3119><t3120>"</t3120>
<t3121>“I was very tired,” I said, which was also true.</t3121>
<t3122>"Did you wake up feeling sick?" he asked.</t3122>
<t3123>“Yes,” I said, which wasn't true.</t3123> <t3124>Since my alarm started ringing at six, I had woken up, then secretly went to the kitchen to eat a cereal bar and drink orange juice.</t3124> <t3125>Ten minutes later, I had stuck two fingers down my throat.</t3125> <t3126>I didn't want to do it the night before because I didn't want the room to smell all night.</t3126> <t3127>Vomiting was awful but it was over quickly.</t3127>
<t3128>My mother took the bucket away, I could hear her cleaning it in the kitchen.</t3128> <t3129>She returned with the clean bucket, her lips pursed with worry.</t3129> <t3130>“Well, as if I needed permission...” she began, but I interrupted her.</t3130>
<t3131>“I'm really fine,” I said.</t3131> <t3132>“It's just that my stomach is upset.</t3132> <t3133>From something I ate.</t3133><t3134>”</t3134>
<t3135>“Are you sure?</t3135><t3136>”</t3136>
<t3137>“If I get worse, I'll call,” I said.</t3137> <t3138>She kissed me on the forehead.</t3138> <t3139>I could feel her sticky lipstick on my skin.</t3139> <t3140>I wasn't really sick, but somehow she had still managed to make me feel better.</t3140>
<t3141>"Do you want me to close the door?" he asked while one hand was on the door.</t3141> <t3142>The door was holding onto its hinges, but barely.</t3142>
<t3143>“No no, no,” I said, I think in a rather tense state.</t3143>
<t3144>“Okay,” he said.</t3144> <t3145>“I will call the school on my way to work.</t3145> <t3146>If you need anything, let me know.</t3146> <t3147>Whatever it is.</t3147> <t3148>Or if you want me to come home.</t3148> <t3149>You can always call your dad.</t3149> <t3150>I will check on you in the afternoon, okay?</t3150><t3151>”</t3151>
<t3152>I nodded my head and pulled the sheet back up to my chin.</t3152> <t3153>Even though the bucket had been cleaned, I could still smell the vomit beneath the detergent, for some reason the smell reminded me of the act of vomiting, making me want to vomit again, but I breathed more slowly until I heard the Chrysler backing out of the driveway.</t3153> <t3154>It was 07:32.</t3154> <t3155>For the first time, I thought, I could leave on time.</t3155> <t3156>Not to school, of course.</t3156> <t3157>But still.</t3157>
<t3158>I took a shower, brushed my teeth, and put on my dark jeans and a plain black t-shirt.</t3158> <t3159>I put Margo's piece of newspaper in my pocket.</t3159> <t3160>I hammered the hinges into place and got ready.</t3160> <t3161>I wasn't exactly sure what to pack in my backpack, but I added a screwdriver for opening door frames, a printout of the satellite map, the directions, a bottle of water, and Whitman in case Margo was there.</t3161> <t3162>I wanted to ask her questions about the book.</t3162>
<t3163>Ben and Radar arrived exactly at eight o'clock.</t3163> <t3164>I sat in the back seat.</t3164> <t3165>They were shouting along to a song by the Mountain Goats.</t3165>
<t3166>He turned his back and extended his fist towards me.</t3166> <t3167>Even though I hated this greeting, I lightly bumped his fist.</t3167> <t3168>“Q!” he shouted, overpowering the music.</t3168> <t3169>“Doesn't this feel so good?</t3169><t3170>”</t3170>
<t3171>I understood very well what Ben meant: In May, on a Wednesday morning, he was referring to listening to Mountain Goats with your friends in a car heading towards Margo and whatever Margoesque prize would be won by finding her.</t3171> <t3172>"It beats math," I replied.</t3172> <t3173>The music was too loud for us to talk.</t3173> <t3174>As soon as we left Jefferson Park, we rolled down the only window that wasn't broken so the world could learn that our taste in music was good.</t3174>
<t3175>Throughout my life, we passed by the movie theaters and bookstores that I had driven past countless times, continuing towards Colonial Boulevard.</t3175> <t3176>But this time it was different and better because it was happening during math class, because it was happening with Radar and Ben, because it was happening while I was heading to the place where I believed I would find Margo.</t3176> <t3177>Finally, after about thirty-five kilometers, Orlando gave way to the last remaining orange groves and undeveloped farms...</t3177> <t3178>this endless flat land was covered with shrubs, parasitic plants hanging motionless in the windless hot air from the branches of oak trees.</t3178> <t3179>This was the Florida where I had spent mosquito-bitten nights chasing armadillos as a young scout.</t3179> <t3180>Now the street was dominated by pickup trucks, and every kilometer, it was possible to see a neighborhood branching off from the main road...</t3180> <t3181>narrow streets inexplicably surrounding houses that rose from nothing like a volcano made of insulated facades.</t3181>
<t3182>Further away, we saw a decayed wooden sign that read GROVEPOINT ACRES.</t3182> <t3183>The cracked asphalt road was only sixty meters long and ended in a wide, gray-looking dirt area, indicating that Grovepoint Acres was, as my mother put it, a semi-neighborhood, abandoned before it could be completed.</t3183> <t3184>Semi-neighborhoods had been shown to me a few times by my parents while driving around, but I had never seen one this desolate.</t3184>
<t3185>Turning off the music on the radar, "It should be in about one and a half kilometers," he said, as we had passed Grovepoint Acres by about eight kilometers.</t3185>
<t3186>I took a deep breath.</t3186> <t3187>The excitement of being somewhere other than school had started to wane.</t3187> <t3188>This place didn’t look like somewhere Margo would hide or visit.</t3188> <t3189>It was a place completely different from New York.</t3189> <t3190>This was Florida, the place people flew over, wondering why anyone would think of settling on this peninsula.</t3190> <t3191>I looked at the empty asphalt, the heat was distorting my vision.</t3191> <t3192>In the distance, I saw a shopping center shimmering in the bright area, resembling a factory outlet store.</t3192>
<t3193>"This one?" I asked, leaning forward and pointing.</t3193>
<t3194>"It should be so," said Radar.</t3194>
<t3195>When I pressed the radio button and pulled the car into the parking lot that had long been overtaken by gray sandy soil, we all fell silent.</t3195> <t3196>Once, signs had been put up for the four stores here.</t3196> <t3197>A rusted pole about two and a half meters high stood by the side of the road.</t3197> <t3198>But the sign had long gone, either blown away by a hurricane or rotted away over time.</t3198> <t3199>The stores had held up a bit better: it was a single-story building with a flat roof, and in some places, bare concrete columns could be seen.</t3199> <t3200>The cracked paints had shriveled up like insects clinging to a nest.</t3200> <t3201>Water stains had formed brown abstract paintings between the display windows.</t3201> <t3202>Crooked plywood boards were nailed to the windows.</t3202> <t3203>I was struck by a horrifying thought; the kind of thought that, once it entered the skies of consciousness, would not be taken back: This place did not look like the kind of place to live.</t3203> <t3204>This was the kind of place to die.</t3204>
<t3205>As soon as the car stopped, my nose and mouth were filled with the disgusting smell of death.</t3205> <t3206>I had to swallow the vomit that rose to my throat with raw bitterness.</t3206> <t3207>But now, after all this lost time, I realized how terribly I had misunderstood both Margo's game and the reward of winning.</t3207>
<t3208>I am getting out of the car, Ben is standing next to me, and Radar is next to him.</t3208> <t3209>Suddenly, I realize that this isn't fun, "hanging out with me</t3209>
<t3210>I understand that I am not something like "prove that you are good enough."</t3210> <t3211>I can hear Margo while wandering around Orlando that night.</t3211> <t3212>I can hear her saying to me, “I don’t want a few kids to find me in Jefferson Park on a Saturday morning with flies swarming over me.”</t3212> <t3213>Not wanting to be found in Jefferson Park by a few kids is not the same as not wanting to die.</t3213>
<t3214>Aside from the smell, this morbidly sharp stench designed to keep the living away from the dead, there is no evidence that anyone has been here for a long time.</t3214> <t3215>I tell myself that Margo couldn't smell like this, but of course, she could.</t3215> <t3216>We all could.</t3216> <t3217>I lift my arm to my nose to catch the scent of sweat and skin, anything other than death.</t3217>
<t3218>Radar calls out, "MARGO?"</t3218> <t3219>A mockingbird perched on the building's rusty grate responds with a two-syllable scream.</t3219> <t3220>Radar shouts again, "MARGO!"</t3220> <t3221>Nothing.</t3221> <t3222>He digs a parabola in the sand with his foot and sighs.</t3222> <t3223>"Damn it.</t3223><t3224>"</t3224>
<t3225>While standing in front of this building, I am learning something about fear.</t3225> <t3226>I am learning that fear is not the empty fantasies of someone who wants something significant to happen to them, even if that significant thing is terrifying.</t3226> <t3227>Fear is not the disgust of seeing a stranger's corpse or the breathtaking sound of a gunshot outside Becca Arrington's house.</t3227> <t3228>This cannot be managed with breathing exercises.</t3228> <t3229>This fear is incomparable to the fears I have known before.</t3229> <t3230>This is the most fundamental of all possible emotions, a feeling that was with us before our existence, before this building existed, before the world existed.</t3230> <t3231>This is the fear that drove fish to crawl onto land and develop lungs, the fear that taught us to run, the fear that made us bury our dead.</t3231>
<t3232>Despair leaves me seized by a panic filled with helplessness...</t3232> <t3233>not a panic like my lungs running out of air, but a panic as if the atmosphere itself is running out of air.</t3233> <t3234>I think I spent most of my life in fear because when real fear came</t3234>
<t3235>I was trying to prepare myself for him, to train my body.</t3235> <t3236>But I'm not ready.</t3236>
<t3237>“Brother, we must go,” says Ben.</t3237> <t3238>“We should call the police or something.”</t3238> <t3239>We haven't looked at each other yet.</t3239> <t3240>We are still looking at the building, this building that has been abandoned for a long time, likely harboring nothing but corpses.</t3240>
<t3241>“No,” says Radar.</t3241> <t3242>“No no no.</t3242> <t3243>If there’s something to search for, we’ll search.</t3243> <t3244>He left the address for Q.</t3244> <t3245>Not for the police, we have to find a way to get inside.</t3245><t3246>”</t3246>
<t3247>"Inside?" says Ben skeptically.</t3247>
<t3248>I pat Ben on the back and for the first time all day, the three of us look at each other instead of ahead.</t3248> <t3249>This makes the situation bearable.</t3249> <t3250>Something about seeing them makes me feel like Margo won't die until we find her.</t3250> <t3251>"Yes, inside," I say.</t3251>
<t3252>I no longer know who Margo is or was, but I need to find her.</t3252>
<t3253>We walk around the back of the building and find nothing but four steel doors and dwarf palms dotting the sixty-green grassy area.</t3253> <t3254>The foul smell is worse here, and I feel afraid to keep walking.</t3254> <t3255>Ben and Radar are right behind me, to my right and left.</t3255> <t3256>We form a triangle together, walking slowly, our eyes scanning the surroundings.</t3256>
<t3257>“It's a raccoon!” Ben shouts.</t3257> <t3258>“Oh, thank God.</t3258> <t3259>A raccoon.</t3259> <t3260>My God.” We move away from the building to join Ben by a shallow drainage ditch with Radar.</t3260> <t3261>A huge, swollen raccoon lies dead with matted fur, no visible trauma, its fur falling out, one of its ribs exposed.</t3261> <t3262>Radar turns around and retches, but nothing comes out.</t3262> <t3263>I lean down next to Radar and place my hand between his shoulder blades, and as he breathes, he says, “Damn, I'm so glad to see that damn dead raccoon.”</t3263>
<t3264>But despite everything, I can't imagine Margo alive here.</t3264> <t3265>The thought that Whitman's poem might be a suicide note crosses my mind.</t3265> <t3266>I think about the things she underlined: "To die is different from what anyone supposed, and luckier." "I bequeath myself to the dirt to grow from the grass I love, / If you want me again, look for me under your boot-soles."</t3266> <t3267>Thinking about the last line of the poem, I feel a wave of hope for a moment: "I stop somewhere waiting for you</t3267>
<t3268>"you."</t3268> <t3269>But then I think that the word "I" does not have to be a person.</t3269> <t3270>"I" could also be a corpse.</t3270>
<t3271>Radar moves away from the raccoon and hangs onto the handle of one of the four steel doors.</t3271> <t3272>I actually want to pray for the dead, as if I should recite Kaddish for this raccoon, but I don't even know how to do it.</t3272> <t3273>I feel very sorry for it and I feel very sorry for being so happy to see it this way,</t3273>
<t3274>“It's opening a bit,” Radar shouts towards us.</t3274> <t3275>“Come and help.</t3275><t3276>”</t3276>
<t3277>We wrap our arms around Radar's waist and pull the door back with Ben.</t3277> <t3278>Radar braces his foot against the wall to give himself extra strength while pulling, then suddenly they collapse on top of me, Radar's sweat-soaked shirt sticking to my face.</t3278> <t3279>For a moment, I get excited, thinking we've made it inside.</t3279> <t3280>But then I see Radar holding the doorknob.</t3280> <t3281>With difficulty, I get up and look at the door.</t3281> <t3282>It's still locked.</t3282>
<t3283>“Damn, you forty-year-old cursed door handle,” says Radar.</t3283> <t3284>I had never heard him talk like that before.</t3284>
<t3285>“No problem,” I say.</t3285> <t3286>“There is a way.</t3286> <t3287>There must be.</t3287><t3288>”</t3288>
<t3289>We walk the entire way back towards the front of the building.</t3289> <t3290>There is no door, no hole, no visible tunnel.</t3290> <t3291>But I need to get inside.</t3291> <t3292>Ben and Radar are trying to remove the boards from the window, but they are all nailed down.</t3292> <t3293>Radar kicks the board, but it doesn't give way.</t3293> <t3294>Ben turns to me.</t3294> <t3295>"There is no glass behind any of these panels," he says, then starts running away from the building, his sneakers kicking up sand as he goes.</t3295>
<t3296>I give her a look that shows my confusion.</t3296> <t3297>“I will break the board,” she explains.</t3297>
<t3298>"You can't do it."</t3298> <t3299>I, the smallest of our light trio.</t3299> <t3300>If someone is going to try to break the boards, it should be me.</t3300>
<t3301>I clench my hands into fists, then extend my fingers.</t3301> <t3302>As I walk towards him, he starts talking to me.</t3302> <t3303>“When my mom tried to protect me from being beaten up in third grade, she enrolled me in taekwondo.</t3303> <t3304>I only went to about three lessons and learned just one thing, but sometimes that one thing works: We would watch the taekwondo master punch through a thick board, and we would all look like, dude, how did he do that, and the master told us if you move your hand as if it’s going through the board and believe that your hand will go through, then it will happen.</t3304><t3305>”</t3305>
<t3306>As he springs into action and runs past me in a blur, I am about to dismiss his foolish logic.</t3306> <t3307>He continues to accelerate as he approaches the board and then, completely fearlessly, at the very last possible second, he leaps into the air, twists his body sideways with his shoulder out to bear the brunt of the impact, and crashes into the board.</t3307> <t3308>Part of me expects Ben to smash through the board and leave a Ben-shaped hole in it like a cartoon character.</t3308> <t3309>Instead, he bounces off the board and lands on his backside on a bright patch of grass in the middle of the sandy soil sea.</t3309> <t3310>Ben rolls to the side, rubbing his shoulder.</t3310> <t3311>“It broke,” he declares.</t3311>
<t3312>As I run towards her, I assume she means her shoulder, but then she stands up and I look at the crack in the particle board at Ben's height.</t3312> <t3313>I start kicking, and the crack widens horizontally, then Radar and I start pulling ourselves up by sticking our fingers into the crack.</t3313> <t3314>Squinting to prevent the sweat from stinging my eyes, I look and swing back and forth with all my strength until I start creating a jagged opening.</t3314> <t3315>With silent effort, Radar and I press against the opening until he finally needs a break, then Ben takes his place.</t3315> <t3316>At last, we manage to punch a large, hefty piece of the board into the store.</t3316> <t3317>My feet climb first, and I blindly land on something that feels like a pile of paper.</t3317>
<t3318>The hole we carved into the building lets in a bit of light, but I can't even make out the dimensions of the space or whether there is a ceiling.</t3318> <t3319>The air inside is so stale and hot that breathing in or out feels the same.</t3319>
<t3320>I turn around and my chin hits Ben's forehead.</t3320> <t3321>Even though there is no reason, I find myself whispering.</t3321> <t3322>"Is there something...</t3322><t3323>"</t3323>
<t3324>Before I can finish my sentence, Ben whispers in response, "No."</t3324> <t3325>"Radar, did you bring the flashlight?</t3325><t3326>"</t3326>
<t3327>I hear Radar going through the hole.</t3327> <t3328>"I have one on my keychain.</t3328> <t3329>It's not a big deal, though.</t3329><t3330>"</t3330>
<t3331>The light is on and I still can't see very well, but I can understand that we have stepped into a large room filled with a labyrinth of metal shelves.</t3331> <t3332>The papers on the floor are pages from an old calendar, days scattered around the room, all yellowed and gnawed by mice.</t3332> <t3333>I wonder if this place was once a small bookstore, however, these shelves haven't held anything but dust for decades.</t3333>
<t3334>We line up behind Radar.</t3334> <t3335>I hear something creaking above us and we all stop moving.</t3335> <t3336>I try to suppress my panic.</t3336> <t3337>I can hear Radar and Ben's breaths and my feet scraping the ground.</t3337> <t3338>I want to get out of here, but it could just be Margo who's creaking.</t3338> <t3339>Or cocaine addicts.</t3339>
<t3340>“The floors are settling,” whispers Radar, but he seems less sure than usual.</t3340> <t3341>I stand there unable to move.</t3341> <t3342>A minute later, I hear Ben’s voice.</t3342> <t3343>“The last time I was this scared, I peed my pants.</t3343><t3344>”</t3344>
<t3345>“The last time I was this scared,” says Radar, “I had to face the Dark Lord to make the world safe for wizards.</t3345><t3346>”</t3346>
<t3347>I am making a weak attempt.</t3347> <t3348>"The last time I was this scared, I had to sleep in my mother's room.</t3348><t3349>"</t3349>
<t3350>I'm giggling.</t3350> <t3351>"Q, if I were you, I would always be that scared.</t3351> <t3352>Every.</t3352> <t3353>Night.</t3353><t3354>"</t3354>
<t3355>I'm not in the mood to laugh, but their laughter makes the room feel safer, and so we begin to investigate.</t3355> <t3356>We examine each row of shelves and find nothing but a few issues of Readers Digest from the 1970s lying on the floor.</t3356> <t3357>After a while, my eyes adjust to the darkness, and in the gray light, we start walking in different directions at different speeds.</t3357>
<t3358>“No one leaves the room until everyone is mirrored,” I whisper, and they whisper back in agreement.</t3358> <t3359>I move towards one of the walls of the room and find the first evidence that someone has been here since it was abandoned.</t3359> <t3360>A semi-circular, indented, waist-high tunnel has been dug into the wall.</t3360> <t3361>Above, the words DWARF HOLE are written in orange spray paint, accompanied by an auxiliary arrow pointing to the hole below.</t3361> <t3362>“Kids,” says Radar, so loudly that the spell is broken for just a moment.</t3362> <t3363>I follow his voice and find him standing against the opposite wall, his flashlight illuminating another Dwarf Hole.</t3363>
<t3364>The graffiti doesn't particularly look like it belongs to Margo, but it's hard to say for sure.</t3364> <t3365>After all, I had seen her write a single letter with spray paint.</t3365>
<t3366>Radar shines the light into the hole, and I crouch down and go inside.</t3366> <t3367>This room is completely empty except for a rolled-up rug in one corner.</t3367> <t3368>As the flashlight scans the area, I can see adhesive stains on the concrete where a carpet once was.</t3368> <t3369>On the opposite side of the room, I can see just another hole dug into the wall, but this time there is no writing on the wall.</t3369>
<t3370>I crawl through the Dwarf Hole into a room lined with clothes hangers, stainless steel poles still bearing water stains</t3370>
<t3371>It remains attached to the walls.</t3371> <t3372>This room gets better light, and it doesn't take me long to realize that it's because there are a lot of holes in the roof...</t3372> <t3373>The tarred paper is hanging down, and I can see the places where the steel beams are exposed in the roof.</t3373>
<t3374>In front of me, Ben whispers, "Gift shop," and I immediately realize he is right.</t3374>
<t3375>The five display cases in the middle of the room form a pentagon.</t3375> <t3376>The glass that once kept tourists away from tourist knick-knacks is mostly shattered.</t3376> <t3377>Gray paint is peeling off the wall with strange and beautiful patterns, each crack in the paint resembling a snowflake formed by decay.</t3377>
<t3378>Strangely, there are still some items left: A Mickey Mouse phone that I remember from a part of my childhood.</t3378> <t3379>The SUNSHINE ORLANDO t-shirts, which have been eaten by moths but are still folded, are still in the display, with broken glass scattered over them.</t3379> <t3380>Under the glass displays, they find a box full of old tourist brochures advertising now-defunct amusement parks like Alligator World, Crystal Gardens, and others, along with radar maps.</t3380> <t3381>He calls me over and silently points to a green glass alligator figurine standing alone in the display, almost buried in dust.</t3381> <t3382>This is the value of our memories: it's impossible to give away these absurdities.</t3382>
<t3383>First, we go back through the empty room, then through the room with shelves, and finally crawl through the last Dwarf Hole.</t3383> <t3384>This room looks like an office, but there are no computers, and it seems to have been abandoned in a great hurry, as if its workers were teleported to space or something.</t3384> <t3385>There are twenty desks arranged in four rows.</t3385> <t3386>Some desks still have pens on them, and all the desks feature large calendars lying flat on top of them.</t3386> <t3387>Each calendar shows February 1986.</t3387> <t3388>I push a fabric-covered chair, and the chair spins with a rhythmic creak.</t3388> <t3389>Next to one desk, thousands of sticky notes advertising the MartinGale Mortgage Company are piled up in a pyramid shape.</t3389> <t3390>In open boxes, there are printouts from old dot matrix printers, MartinGale</t3390>
<t3391>There are stacks of papers showing the details of the income and expenses of the Mortgage Company.</t3391> <t3392>On top of one of the desks, someone has arranged neighborhood brochures to form a single-story house out of a card.</t3392> <t3393>Thinking there might be a clue inside them, I spread out the brochures, but there isn't.</t3393>
<t3394>Radar, "There is nothing after 1986," he whispers while shuffling the papers with his fingers.</t3394> <t3395>I start to inspect the desk drawers.</t3395> <t3396>I find cotton swabs and tie pins.</t3396> <t3397>Dozens of fountain pens and pencils, packaged in cardboard boxes with old-fashioned fonts and designs.</t3397> <t3398>Paper napkins.</t3398> <t3399>A pair of golf gloves.</t3399>
<t3400>“Children, do you see anything?” I ask.</t3400> <t3401>“Any clue that someone has been here in the last twenty years?</t3401><t3402>”</t3402>
<t3403>“There is nothing but Dwarf Holes,” Ben replies.</t3403> <t3404>This place is a tomb, everything is covered in dust.</t3404>
<t3405>“Then why did Margo direct us here?” asks Radar.</t3405> <t3406>We are talking now.</t3406>
<t3407>"I don't know," I say.</t3407> <t3408>Clearly, Margo is not here.</t3408>
<t3409>“There are some places,” says Radar, “that are less dusty.</t3409> <t3410>In the empty room, there is a dust-free rectangle, as if something has been removed.</t3410> <t3411>But I don't know.</t3411><t3412>”</t3412>
<t3413>“And there's this painted section,” says Ben.</t3413> <t3414>He points, and Radar's flashlight shows that part of the office's opposite wall is painted with white primer, as if someone had the idea to make a change to the room but abandoned the project half an hour later.</t3414> <t3415>I walk towards the wall and, upon getting closer, I can see that there is red graffiti under the white paint.</t3415> <t3416>But I can only see traces of the red graffiti...</t3416> <t3417>definitely not enough to make out anything.</t3417> <t3418>There is an open paint can directly opposite the wall.</t3418> <t3419>I kneel down and press my finger into the paint.</t3419> <t3420>The surface is hard but breaks easily, and my finger comes out covered in white.</t3420> <t3421>As the paint drips from my finger, nothing</t3421>
<t3422>I'm not saying anything because we all come to the same conclusion that someone recently came here, then the building creaks again and Radar drops the flashlight and curses.</t3422>
<t3423>"This is very scary," he says.</t3423>
<t3424>“Kids,” says Ben.</t3424> <t3425>The flashlight is still on the ground, I take a step back to pick it up but then I see Ben pointing at something.</t3425> <t3426>He is pointing at the wall.</t3426> <t3427>Thanks to the indirect light, the letters on the wall writing become readable through the layer of primer paint, and I see a faint writing that I immediately understand is Margo’s.</t3427>
<t3428>YOU WILL GO TO PAPER TOWNS AND NEVER COME BACK</t3428>
<t3429>I pick up the flashlight from the ground and point it directly at the paint, and the message disappears.</t3429> <t3430>But when I point the flashlight at another part of the wall, I can read the writing again.</t3430> <t3431>"Damn," Radar says in a low voice.</t3431>
<t3432>Now I say, "Brother, can we leave now?</t3432> <t3433>Because the last time I was this scared...</t3433> <t3434>screw it.</t3434> <t3435>I'm terrified.</t3435> <t3436>There's nothing funny about this shitty situation," he says.</t3436>
<t3437>There is nothing funny about this shitty situation, maybe the closest Ben can get to the horror I feel.</t3437> <t3438>And for me, that's close enough.</t3438> <t3439>I quickly walk towards the Dwarf Hole.</t3439> <t3440>I can feel the walls closing in on us.</t3440>
<t3441>Ben and Radar dropped me off at home...</t3441> <t3442>despite skipping school, don't skip band practice.</t3442> <t3443>For a long time, I sat alone with My Song and tried to read the entire poem from start to finish for about the tenth time, but the thing was, the poem was about eighty pages long, strange, and overly repetitive, and although I could understand every word, I couldn't understand anything as a whole.</t3443> <t3444>Even though I knew that the underlined sections were probably the only important parts, I wanted to understand whether it was a poem in the style of a suicide note.</t3444> <t3445>But I couldn't make any sense of it.</t3445>
<t3446>When I became frightened enough to decide to call the detective, I had gone through ten confusing pages of the poem.</t3446> <t3447>I found and pulled out the detective's business card from the shorts in the laundry basket.</t3447> <t3448>He answered on the second ring.</t3448> <t3449>"Warren.</t3449><t3450>"</t3450>
<t3451>"Hello, um, I am Quentin Jacobsen.</t3451> <t3452>I am a friend of Margo Roth Spiegelman, but?</t3452><t3453>"</t3453>
<t3454>“Of course, child, I remember you.</t3454> <t3455>How are you?</t3455><t3456>”</t3456>
<t3457>I told her about the clues in the small shopping center and the paper towns, how she called Orlando a paper town from the top of the SunTrust building but didn't use it in plural, how she told me she didn't want to be found, and the matter of finding her under the soles of my shoes.</t3457> <t3458>She didn't tell me not to trespass into abandoned buildings or even ask why I was in an abandoned building at ten in the morning on a school day.</t3458> <t3459>She just let me talk</t3459>
<t3460>He waited until he finished and said, "My God, son, you're almost a detective.</t3460> <t3461>Now all you need is a gun, courage, and three ex-wives.</t3461> <t3462>So, what's your theory?"</t3462>
<t3463>“I am worried that he might have, umm, killed himself.</t3463><t3464>”</t3464>
<t3465>“The thought that this girl did anything other than run away never even crossed my mind, son.</t3465> <t3466>I can understand her situation, but you must remember that she has done this before.</t3466> <t3467>Clues...</t3467> <t3468>add excitement to this whole endeavor.</t3468> <t3469>Honestly, son, if she wanted you to find herdead or aliveyou would have found her by now.</t3469><t3470>”</t3470>
<t3471>“But you too...</t3471><t3472>”</t3472>
<t3473>“Child, the unfortunate thing is that he is legally an adult with free will.</t3473> <t3474>Let me give you some advice: Let him come home.</t3474> <t3475>At some point, you will have to stop looking at the sky, or one day you will look down and see that you have flown away too.</t3475><t3476>”</t3476>
<t3477>I hung up the phone with a bad taste in my mouth...</t3477> <t3478>I had realized that what would lead me to Margo was not Warren's poem.</t3478> <t3479>I kept thinking about the lines Margo had underlined at the end: “I bequeath myself to the dirt to grow from the grass I love, / If you want me again, look for me under your boot-soles.”</t3479> <t3480>According to what Whitman wrote in the first few pages, that grass was the “beautiful uncut hair of graves.”</t3480> <t3481>But where were the graves?</t3481> <t3482>Where were the paper towns?</t3482>
<t3483>“Paper towns” sözü hakkında benden daha fazla bir şey bilip bilmediğini görmek için Omnictionary’ye girdim.</t3483> <t3484>Kokarcakıç adlı bir kullanıcı tarafından yaratılmış, aşırı derecede düşünceli ve yararlı bir girdi vardı: “Paper Town, içinde kâğıt fabrikası olan bir şehirdir.”</t3484> <t3485>Bu Omnictionary’nin kusuruydu: Radar tarafından yazılan şeyler eksiksiz ve aşırı derecede yararlıydı; kokarcakıç’ın editlenmemiş yazısıysa hiç tatmin edici değildi.</t3485> <t3486>Ama bütün interneti taradığımda, Kansas’taki gayrimenkullerle ilgili bir forumda yaklaşık kırk girdi alta gömülmüş ilginç bir şey buldum.</t3486>
<t3487>It looks like the Madison Homes won't be built; my husband and I bought an ordinary house, but this week someone called to tell us they would refund our deposit because they didn't sell enough homes to finance the project.</t3487> <t3488>Another paper town for Kansas! Marge from Cawker, Kansas.</t3488>
<t3489>I feel semtimsi!</t3489> <t3490>You will go to the semtimsis and never return.</t3490> <t3491>I took a deep breath and stared at the screen for a while.</t3491>
<t3492>The outcome seemed inevitable; despite everything that had broken inside her and all the decisions she had made, Margo had not accepted disappearing forever.</t3492> <t3493>And she had decided not to leave her body in an imaginary version of our neighborhood where the first ties had broken.</t3493> <t3494>She had said she didn't want her body to be found by random children...</t3494> <t3495>and it made sense that she had chosen me to find her among all her acquaintances.</t3495> <t3496>She wouldn't have hurt me in a different way.</t3496> <t3497>I had done this before.</t3497> <t3498>I had experience in the field.</t3498>
<t3499>I saw that Radar was online and when a message popped up on my screen, I clicked on it to talk to him.</t3499>
<t3500>OMNICTIONARIAN96: Hello.</t3500>
<t3501>RESURRECTIONIST: Paper towns = neighborhood-like places.</t3501> <t3502>I think your body</t3502>
<t3503>wants me to find it.</t3503> <t3504>Because he thinks I can handle it.</t3504>
<t3505>Because we found that dead man when we were children.</t3505>
<t3506>I sent her the internet address.</t3506>
<t3507>OMNICTIONARIAN96: Slow down.</t3507> <t3508>Let me check the address.</t3508>
<t3509>DİRİLİŞÇİQ: Okay.</t3509>
<t3510>OMNICTIONARIAN96: Okay, don't be so morbid.</t3510>
<t3511>You don't know anything for sure.</t3511> <t3512>Margo is probably fine.</t3512>
<t3513>RESURRECTION ÇIQ: No, you are not thinking.</t3513>
<t3514>OMNICTIONARIAN96: Okay, I don't think so.</t3514> <t3515>But in response to this evidence, if someone is alive...</t3515>
<t3516>DIRILIŞÇIQ: Yes, I think so.</t3516> <t3517>I will go and lie down.</t3517> <t3518>My mom and dad will come home soon.</t3518>
<t3519>But I couldn't calm down, so I called Ben from bed and told him my theory.</t3519>
<t3520>“A rather sickly nonsense, my brother.</t3520> <t3521>But Margo is good.</t3521> <t3522>It's all part of the game she plays.</t3522><t3523>”</t3523>
<t3524>“You are being a bit thoughtless about this matter.</t3524><t3525>”</t3525>
<t3526>He sighed.</t3526> <t3527>“Whatever, it's partly his stupidity, I mean, stealing the last three weeks of school and all...</t3527> <t3528>It worried you, it worried Lacey, and the prom is in like three days, you know.</t3528> <t3529>Can't we just have a fun prom?</t3529><t3530>”</t3530>
<t3531>“Are you serious?</t3531> <t3532>Margo might be dead, Ben.</t3532><t3533>”</t3533>
<t3534>“He hasn't died.</t3534> <t3535>He wants attention.</t3535> <t3536>I mean, I know his parents are shitty, but they know him better than we do, right?</t3536> <t3537>And they think so too.</t3537><t3538>”</t3538>
<t3539>"You can be such an ass-head," I said.</t3539>
<t3540>"Anyway, my brother.</t3540> <t3541>We both had a long day.</t3541> <t3542>We experienced a lot of excitement.</t3542> <t3543>KIB." I wanted to make fun of him for using internet slang in real life, but I felt like I didn't have the energy.</t3543>
<t3544>After hanging up the phone with Ben, I went back online to search for a list of neighborhoods in Florida.</t3544> <t3545>I couldn’t find a list anywhere, but after searching for a while with terms like “abandoned neighborhoods” and “Grovepoint Acres,” I managed to list five places located within a three-hour distance from Jefferson Park.</t3545> <t3546>I printed out a map of Central Florida and pinned it to the wall above my computer, then added a pin for each of the five places.</t3546> <t3547>Looking at the map, I couldn’t find any connection between them.</t3547> <t3548>They were randomly scattered across remote outskirts, and reaching each of them would take at least</t3548>
<t3549>It would take my whole week.</t3549> <t3550>Why hadn't he specified a particular place for me?</t3550> <t3551>All these hellish, terrifying clues.</t3551> <t3552>All these implications of tragedy.</t3552> <t3553>But there was no place.</t3553> <t3554>There was nothing to hold on to.</t3554> <t3555>It was like trying to climb a mountain made of pebbles.</t3555>
<t3556>The next day, since Ben would be driving around in Lacey's jeep for prom shopping, he allowed me to borrow SESIB.</t3556> <t3557>So, for the first time, I didn't have to sit outside the band room... the seventh bell rang, and I ran to Ben's car.</t3557> <t3558>Since I lacked the ability to start Ben's SESIB, I was one of the first to reach the senior parking lot and one of the last to leave, but I finally got the engine running and headed towards Grovepoint Acres.</t3558>
<t3559>Driving slowly out of the city on Colonial Boulevard, I kept an eye out for other neighborhoods I might have missed on the internet.</t3559> <t3560>A long line of cars formed behind me, and I felt uneasy for delaying them; I marveled at how I still had room to worry about such trivial, ridiculous things, like whether the man in the SUV behind me thought I was an overly cautious driver.</t3560> <t3561>I wished Margo's disappearance had changed me, but it hadn't, not exactly.</t3561>
<t3562>As the line of cars snaked behind me like a reluctant funeral procession, I found myself talking out loud to Margo.</t3562> <t3563>I will pull all the strings.</t3563> <t3564>I will not break your trust.</t3564> <t3565>I will find you.</t3565>
<t3566>Strangely, talking to him this way calmed me down.</t3566> <t3567>It prevented me from imagining the possibilities.</t3567> <t3568>I arrived again at the crooked, wooden Grovepoint Acres sign.</t3568> <t3569>As I turned left onto the dead-end asphalt road, I could almost hear the sighs of relief from those behind me.</t3569> <t3570>It looked like a driveway without a house.</t3570> <t3571>I left the SESIB running and got out.</t3571> <t3572>Up close, the Grovepoint Acres’ initially</t3572>
<t3573>I could see that it was more completed than it appeared.</t3573> <t3574>Two dirt roads that ended in dead ends were dug into the dusty ground; although the roads were quite worn, I could barely see their outlines.</t3574> <t3575>As I walked back and forth on both roads, I could feel the warmth in my nose with every breath.</t3575> <t3576>The scorching sun made it difficult to move, but I knew the truth that felt good despite being a bit sickly: The heat smelled of death, and Grovepoint Acres smelled of nothing but cooked air and car exhaust...</t3576> <t3577>I searched for evidence that Margo had been there: footprints, something written in the dirt, or a keepsake.</t3577> <t3578>But I seemed to be the first person to walk these nameless dirt roads in years.</t3578> <t3579>The ground was flat and not many bushes had grown yet, so I could see quite far in every direction.</t3579> <t3580>There was no tent.</t3580> <t3581>There was no campfire.</t3581> <t3582>There was no Margo.</t3582>
<t3583>I went back to SESIB and drove to I4, then went to a place called Holly Meadows in the northeast of the city.</t3583> <t3584>I passed by Holly Meadows three times until I finally found it...</t3584> <t3585>The only things around were oak trees and farmland, and Holly Meadows, which had no sign at its entrance, didn't stand out much.</t3585> <t3586>But as soon as I moved a few meters along the dirt road branching off from the first road with oak and pine trees, the place became as desolate as Grovepoint Acres.</t3586> <t3587>The main dirt road slowly evaporated and turned into a dirt field.</t3587> <t3588>I couldn't see any other road, but while walking around, I found a few spray-painted wooden stakes on the ground; I guessed they were once boundary markers for the plots.</t3588> <t3589>I couldn't see or smell anything suspicious, but I still felt a fear pressing on my chest. At first, I didn't understand why, but then I saw it: when they cleared the land for construction, they had left a solitary oak tree near the back boundary.</t3589> <t3590>And this crooked tree, with its thick-barked branches, reminded me of Robert Joyner in Jefferson Park.</t3590>
<t3591>It looked so much like the place we were in that I was almost certain Margo was there, on the other side of the tree.</t3591>
<t3592>I had to bring that moment to my mind for the first time: Margo Itoth Spiegelman, leaning against the trunk of the tree, her eyes dull, black blood flowing from her mouth, her whole body swollen and decomposed because it took me so long to find her.</t3592> <t3593>She had trusted me to find her sooner.</t3593> <t3594>She had trusted me on her last night.</t3594> <t3595>And I had let her down.</t3595> <t3596>Even though there was no other taste in the air except the taste of "it might rain later," I was sure I had found Margo.</t3596>
<t3597>But no.</t3597> <t3598>This was just a tree, a solitary tree in the empty silver-colored soil.</t3598> <t3599>I sat down leaning against the trunk of the tree and caught my breath.</t3599> <t3600>I hated doing this alone.</t3600> <t3601>I hated it.</t3601> <t3602>If Robert Joyner thought he was preparing me for this, he was wrong.</t3602> <t3603>I didn't know Robert Joyner.</t3603> <t3604>I didn't like Robert Joyner.</t3604>
<t3605>I punched the ground, then punched it again and again, until I hit the tree's exposed roots, sand scattering around from between my hands, I continued, the pain rapidly increasing as it passed through my palms and wrists.</t3605> <t3606>Until then, I hadn't cried for Margo, but finally, at that moment, I cried, punching the ground and shouting because there was no one to hear: I miss her I miss her I miss her I miss her I miss her.</t3606>
<t3607>Even after my arms grew tired and my eyes dried up, I sat there and stayed, thinking about it until the light turned gray.</t3607>
<t3608>The next day at school, I found Ben talking with Lacey, Radar, and Angela in the shade of a low-branched tree next to the band room door.</t3608> <t3609>It was hard for me to listen while they talked about prom and how Lacey harbored animosity towards Becca.</t3609> <t3610>I was waiting for an opportunity to tell them what I had seen, but then when I finally got the chance and said, "I looked at two umbrellas for quite a long time but didn't find much," I realized there really wasn't anything new to say.</t3610>
<t3611>Nobody seemed that worried, except for Lacey.</t3611> <t3612>She nodded while I talked about my neighborhood friends.</t3612> <t3613>"Last night on the internet, I read that people with suicidal tendencies end relationships with those they are angry with.</t3613> <t3614>And they give away their belongings.</t3614> <t3615>Last week, Margo gave me about five pairs of jeans, saying they fit me better, which isn't even true because she's much more, well, curvy." I liked Lacey, but I understood what Margo meant about Lacey always trying to harm her.</t3615>
<t3616>Something about telling us this story made her start crying, Ben put his arm around her and Lacey rested her head on Ben's shoulder, which was difficult because in her high heels, Lacey was taller than Ben.</t3616>
<t3617>“Lacey, we just need to find one location.</t3617> <t3618>So, talk to your friends.</t3618> <t3619>Did he ever mention paper towns?</t3619> <t3620>Did he ever mention a specific</t3620>
<t3621>Did he mention the place?</t3621> <t3622>Was there a neighborhood that had any meaning for him?" She shrugged and buried herself in Ben's shoulder.</t3622>
<t3623>“Brother, don't force him,” said Ben.</t3623> <t3624>I sighed but kept my mouth shut.</t3624>
<t3625>“I’m in the internet business,” said Radar, “but the username hasn’t logged into Omnictionary since you left.</t3625><t3626>”</t3626>
<t3627>And suddenly they returned to the topic of the prom.</t3627> <t3628>Lacey, still looking upset and distracted, lifted her head from Ben's shoulder but tried to laugh while Ben and Radar shared stories about getting corsages for each other.</t3628>
<t3629>The day passed as usual...</t3629> <t3630>in slow motion, casting thousands of tearful glances at the clock.</t3630> <t3631>But now it was even more unbearable because every minute I spent at school was another minute I failed to find her.</t3631>
<t3632>The only slightly interesting class that day was my literature class where Dr. Holden, assuming we had all read Moby Dick, completely ruined the book for me by talking about Captain Ahab and his obsession with finding and killing that white whale.</t3632> <t3633>But it was fun to watch him get more and more excited as he talked.</t3633> <t3634>“Ahab is a madman who curses fate.</t3634> <t3635>In the novel, you didn't see Ahab want anything else, did you?</t3635> <t3636>He has a single obsession.</t3636> <t3637>And because he's the captain of the ship, no one can stop him.</t3637> <t3638>If you choose to write about him in your final papers, you can argue that Ahab is a fool because of his obsession...</t3638> <t3639>But you can also discuss that there is something tragically heroic in his continuing this doomed struggle.</t3639> <t3640>Is Ahab's hope something akin to madness, or is it the very definition of humanity?”</t3640> <t3641>Realizing that I could ace the final paper without actually reading the book, I wrote down as much as I could from what he said.</t3641> <t3642>As he spoke, it occurred to me that Dr. Holden was unusually good at reading things.</t3642> <t3643>And he had said he liked Whitman.</t3643>
<t3644>So when the bell rang, I took out my Grass Blades from my bag, while everyone else hurriedly went either home or to places unrelated to class, I slowly zipped up my bag.</t3644> <t3645>I waited behind someone who was asking for extra time for an already late assignment, then the kid left.</t3645>
<t3646>“Here is my favorite Whitman reader,” he said.</t3646>
<t3647>I smiled with difficulty.</t3647> <t3648>“Do you know Margo Roth Spiegelman?” I asked.</t3648>
<t3649>He sat at his desk and motioned for me to sit as well.</t3649> <t3650>"He never attended my class," said Dr. Holden, "but I definitely heard about him.</t3650> <t3651>I know he ran away from home.</t3651><t3652>"</t3652>
<t3653>“This poetry book was left to me, well, before disappearing.”</t3653> <t3654>I handed the book to him and Dr. Holden slowly started turning the pages.</t3654> <t3655>I continued talking as he turned the pages.</t3655> <t3656>“I thought a lot about the underlined sections.</t3656> <t3657>If you go to the end of My Own Song, he underlined these things about dying.</t3657> <t3658>Things like: ‘If you want me again, look for me under your soles.</t3658><t3659>’”</t3659>
<t3660>“He left this for you,” said Dr. Holden quietly.</t3660>
<t3661>"Yes," I said.</t3661>
<t3662>He turned it over again and lightly tapped the word underlined in green with his fingernail.</t3662> <t3663>“What's the deal with the door frames?</t3663> <t3664>This is a wonderful moment in the poem, you can feel Whitman shouting at you: ‘Open the doors!</t3664> <t3665>In fact, break down the doors!</t3665><t3666>”’</t3666>
<t3667>“Actually, he left something else inside the frame of my door.</t3667><t3668>”</t3668>
<t3669>Dr. Holden laughed.</t3669> <t3670>“Wow.</t3670> <t3671>Smart.</t3671> <t3672>But this is such a wonderful poem that...</t3672> <t3673>I hate to see it reduced to such a plain reading.</t3673> <t3674>And it seems like you have reacted very darkly to a poem that is ultimately very optimistic.</t3674> <t3675>This poem is about our connectedness...</t3675> <t3676>about each of us sharing the same root system like blades of grass.</t3676><t3677>”</t3677>
<t3678>“But I mean, from what you underlined, it looks like a suicide note,” I said.</t3678> <t3679>Dr. Holden read the last stanzas again and looked up at me.</t3679>
<t3680>“What a great mistake it is to dissect this poem into something hopeless.</t3680> <t3681>I hope that's not the case, Quentin.</t3681> <t3682>If you read the entire poem, I don't understand how you could come to any other conclusion than that life is sacred and valuable.</t3682> <t3683>But... who knows.</t3683> <t3684>Maybe he skimmed through the poem for what he was looking for.</t3684> <t3685>That's usually how we read poems.</t3685> <t3686>But if that's the case, he completely misunderstood what Whitman wanted from him.</t3686><t3687>”</t3687>
<t3688>“What is that?</t3688><t3689>”</t3689>
<t3690>He closed the book and looked at me in a way that made it impossible for me to return his gaze.</t3690> <t3691>“What are you thinking?</t3691><t3692>”</t3692>
<t3693>“I don't know,” I said, looking at the pile of graded assignments on his desk.</t3693> <t3694>“I tried to read it straight through many times, but I couldn't get very far.</t3694> <t3695>Mostly, I just read the sections she underlined.</t3695> <t3696>I'm reading the poem to try to understand Margo, not to try to understand Whitman.</t3696><t3697>”</t3697>
<t3698>He took a pen and wrote something on the back of an envelope.</t3698> <t3699>“Wait.</t3699> <t3700>I'm writing this down.</t3700><t3701>”</t3701>
<t3702>“What?”</t3702>
<t3703>“As you said,” he explained.</t3703>
<t3704>“Why?</t3704><t3705>”</t3705>
<t3706>“Because I think this is exactly what Whitman would want.</t3706> <t3707>For you to see Your Own Song not just as a poem, but also as a way to understand someone else.</t3707> <t3708>But instead of reading these pieces made up of just quotes and hints, perhaps you should read it as a poem.</t3708> <t3709>I think there are interesting connections between the poet in Your Own Song and Margo Spiegelman...</t3709> <t3710>all that wild charisma and passion for travel.</t3710> <t3711>If you only read small parts of it, a poem doesn't achieve its purpose.</t3711><t3712>”</t3712>
<t3713>“Well, thank you,” I said.</t3713> <t3714>I took the book and stood up.</t3714> <t3715>It couldn't be said that I felt any better.</t3715>
<t3716>() In the afternoon, I went home with Ben and stayed at his house until we went to pick up Radar for a pre-prom party given by our friend Jake, whose parents were out of town.</t3716> <t3717>Ben wanted me to go too, but I wasn't in the mood.</t3717>
<t3718>Walking, I passed through the park where Margo and I found the dead man and turned back.</t3718> <t3719>I remembered that morning, and with that memory, I felt something turning in my stomach...</t3719> <t3720>not because of the dead man, but because I remembered that Margo was the one who found him first.</t3720> <t3721>Even in a playground in my own neighborhood, I was incapable of finding a dead body on my own...</t3721> <t3722>How was I going to do it now?</t3722>
<t3723>That night when I came home, I tried to read My Own Song again, but despite Dr. Holden's advice, the poem was still turning into a jumble of meaningless words.</t3723>
<t3724>I woke up early in the morning, a little after eight, and went to my computer.</t3724> <t3725>He was online, so I sent him a message.</t3725>
<t3726>DİRİLİŞÇİQ: How was the party?</t3726>
<t3727>IT WAS A KIDNEY INFECTION: Crap, of course.</t3727> <t3728>Every party I go to is crap.</t3728>
<t3729>RESURRECTIONIST: Sorry, I missed it.</t3729> <t3730>You woke up early.</t3730> <t3731>Do you want to come and play Resurrection?</t3731>
<t3732>ITWASAKIDNEYINFECTION: Are you kidding?</t3732> <t3733>RESURRECTIONISTQ: Uh... no?</t3733>
<t3734>ITWASAKIDNEYINFECTION: Do you know what day it is today?</t3734>
<t3735>RESURRECTIONIST: Saturday, May 15?</t3735>
<t3736>ITWASAKIDNEYINFECTION: Brother, the ball starts in eleven hours and fourteen minutes.</t3736> <t3737>I need to pick up Lacey in less than nine hours.</t3737> <t3738>I haven't even washed and polished the SESIB yet, by the way, you did a good job of getting it dirty.</t3738> <t3739>After that, I have to take a shower, shave, trim my nose hairs, and wash and polish myself.</t3739> <t3740>God, let's not even go there.</t3740> <t3741>I have a lot to do.</t3741> <t3742>Look, if I get a chance, I'll call you later.</t3742>
<t3743>Radar was online, so I sent him a message.</t3743>
<t3744>RESURRECTION ÇİQ: What is Ben's problem?</t3744>
<t3745>OMNICTIONARIAN96: Take it easy, cowboy.</t3745>
<t3746>DİRİLİŞÇİQ: I'm sorry, I just got upset because I thought Ben's balloon was very important.</t3746>
<t3747>OMNICTIONARIAN96: The only reason I have to leave so early is that I really need to pick up my tuxedo, and you're going to be quite mad when you hear this, aren't you?</t3747> <t3748>DİRİLİŞÇİQ: My God.</t3748> <t3749>Seriously?</t3749>
<t3750>OMNICTIONARIAN96: Q, yann, the next day and the day after that and every day for the rest of my life, I would be happy to join your research.</t3750> <t3751>But I have a girlfriend.</t3751> <t3752>She wants to have a nice prom.</t3752> <t3753>I want to have a nice prom too.</t3753> <t3754>It's not my fault that Margo Roth Spiegelman doesn't want us to have a nice prom.</t3754>
<t3755>I didn't know what to say.</t3755> <t3756>Maybe he was right.</t3756> <t3757>Maybe Margo deserved to be forgotten.</t3757> <t3758>But in any case, I couldn't forget her.</t3758>
<t3759>My mom and dad were still in bed, watching an old movie on TV.</t3759> <t3760>"Can I take the minivan?" I asked.</t3760>
<t3761>“Of course, why?</t3761><t3762>”</t3762>
<t3763>“I decided to go to Baloya,” I replied hastily.</t3763> <t3764>This lie came to my mind as I spoke.</t3764> <t3765>“After choosing a tuxedo, I must go to Ben’s; we are both going without dates.”</t3765> <t3766>My mother straightened up with a smile.</t3766>
<t3767>“Well, I think this is great, sweetie.</t3767> <t3768>It will be very good for you.</t3768> <t3769>Will you come back so we can take a photo?</t3769><t3770>”</t3770>
<t3771>“Anne, do you really need a photo of me going to the prom without a date?</t3771> <t3772>I mean, hasn't my life been embarrassing enough already?”</t3772> <t3773>She laughed.</t3773>
<t3774>"Come back before your curfew," said my father, as it was midnight.</t3774>
<t3775>“Absolutely,” I said.</t3775> <t3776>It was so easy to lie to them that I wondered why I hadn't done it more often before that night with Margo.</t3776>
<t3777>I headed towards Kissimmee and the amusement parks, getting onto Route 14, then passed the Boulevard where Margo and I had trespassed into SeaWorld, and then onto Route 27 heading towards Haines City.</t3777> <t3778>I got onto the highway.</t3778> <t3779>There are many lakes in Haines City, and wherever there are lakes in Florida, there are also wealthy people gathered around them, so it didn't seem like a likely place for a neighborhood.</t3779> <t3780>However, the website I found was adamant that it was a huge parcel of land that no one had managed to develop.</t3780> <t3781>I recognized it immediately because while all the other neighborhoods along the road were surrounded by walls, Quail Hollow was just a plastic sign staked into the ground.</t3781> <t3782>As I turned in, I saw small plastic signs that read FOR SALE, CENTRAL AREA, and GREAT DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES!</t3782>
<t3783>Unlike the previous neighborhoods, someone was keeping Quail Hollow alive.</t3783> <t3784>No houses had been built, but the plots were marked with survey stakes and the lawns were freshly mowed.</t3784> <t3785>All the streets were paved and named with street signs.</t3785> <t3786>In the center of the neighborhood, a perfectly circular lake had been dug and then for some reason drained.</t3786> <t3787>As we moved forward in the minivan, about three meters of the lake</t3787>
<t3788>I could see that it was round and about 100 meters in diameter.</t3788> <t3789>A hose, passing from the bottom of the crater, was winding its way towards the middle part where a steel and aluminum fountain rose from the bottom to eye level.</t3789> <t3790>I found myself grateful that the lake was empty, so I wouldn't have to look into the water and wonder if Margo was somewhere at the bottom, waiting for me to dive in with a scuba tank to find her.</t3790>
<t3791>I was sure that Margo couldn’t be in Quail Hollow.</t3791> <t3792>This place was too adjacent to other neighborhoods to be suitable for hiding, whether you were a person or a corpse.</t3792> <t3793>But I looked anyway, and as I wandered the streets aimlessly, I felt very hopeless.</t3793> <t3794>I wanted to be happy that it wasn’t the place.</t3794> <t3795>But if it wasn’t Quail Hollow, it would be the next place or the one after that or the one after that...</t3795> <t3796>Or maybe I would never find her.</t3796> <t3797>Was that a better fate?</t3797>
<t3798>I finished my patrol without finding anything and returned to the main road.</t3798> <t3799>I got lunch from a place that serves cars, then ate it while driving west towards the small shopping mall.</t3799>
<t3800>As I was pulling into the parking lot of the small shopping center, I noticed that blue electrical tape was used to cover the hole we had made in our sign.</t3800> <t3801>I wondered who could have come here after us.</t3801>
<t3802>I drove around and moved the car to the back, parking the minivan next to a shabby dumpster that hadn't encountered a garbage truck in decades.</t3802> <t3803>I thought I could pierce through the electrical tape if necessary; I was heading towards the front when I noticed that the steel back doors leading to the stores had no visible hinges.</t3803>
<t3804>Thanks to Margo, I had learned a thing or two about hinges and realized why we never had any luck pulling all those doors: They opened inward.</t3804> <t3805>I went to the mortgage company's office and pushed the door.</t3805> <t3806>It opened without any resistance.</t3806> <t3807>God, we were so stupid.</t3807> <t3808>Surely whoever was in charge of the building was aware of the unlocked door, which made the electrical tape even more pointless.</t3808>
<t3809>I took out the backpack I had prepared that morning and lit up the room with my dad's high-powered Maglite.</t3809> <t3810>Something rather large quickly fled from the roof beam.</t3810> <t3811>I shuddered.</t3811> <t3812>Small lizards scurried away, jumping from the places illuminated by the light.</t3812>
<t3813>A single beam of light coming from the hole in the ceiling illuminated the front corner of the room, and sunlight was seeping in from behind the chipboard, but I mostly relied on the flashlight.</t3813> <t3814>I walked back and forth among the rows of desks, looking at the items we found in the drawers and left there.</t3814> <t3815>Seeing the same unmarked calendar on the desks one after another was chilling enough to seep into one's soul: February 1986.</t3815> <t3816>February 1986.</t3816> <t3817>February 1986.</t3817> <t3818>June 1986.</t3818> <t3819>February 1986.</t3819> <t3820>I turned around and shone the light on the desk in the very center of the room.</t3820> <t3821>The calendar had moved to June.</t3821> <t3822>I leaned in closer and looked at the calendar page, hoping to see a jagged edge where previous months had been torn off or some marks where a pen had left an impression on the paper, but there was nothing different from the other calendars, except for the date.</t3822>
<t3823>With the flashlight wedged between my neck and shoulder, I began to carefully examine the desk drawers again, paying special attention to the June table: a few napkins, a few still sharp pencils, notes about mortgages addressed to someone named Dennis McMahon, an empty pack of Marlboro Lights, and an almost full bottle of red nail polish.</t3823>
<t3824>I took the flashlight in one hand and the nail polish in the other, and looked closely at the bottle.</t3824> <t3825>It was so red that it was almost black.</t3825> <t3826>I had seen this color before.</t3826> <t3827>This nail polish was on the panel of the minivan that night.</t3827> <t3828>Suddenly, the scurrying in the rafters and the creaking inside the building became insignificant...</t3828> <t3829>I felt a perverse excitement.</t3829> <t3830>Of course, I couldn't know if it was the same bottle, but it was definitely the same color.</t3830>
<t3831>I turned the bottle around and saw, undeniably, the stain of blue spray paint on the outside of the bottle.</t3831> <t3832>It was coming from her spray-painted fingers.</t3832> <t3833>Now I could be sure.</t3833> <t3834>After we parted ways that morning, Margo had come here.</t3834> <t3835>Maybe she was still staying here.</t3835> <t3836>Maybe she only appeared late at night.</t3836> <t3837>Maybe she had taped the sign to protect her privacy.</t3837>
<t3838>At that moment, I made a firm decision to stay there until morning.</t3838> <t3839>If Margo had slept here, I could sleep too.</t3839> <t3840>Thus, a brief conversation began between myself and me.</t3840>
<t3841>Ben: But mice.</t3841>
<t3842>Ben: Yes, but they look like they're melting on the ceiling.</t3842>
<t3843>Ben: But lizards.</t3843>
<t3844>Ben: Oh, come on.</t3844> <t3845>When you were little, you used to pull off my tails.</t3845> <t3846>You're not afraid of lizards.</t3846>
<t3847>Ben: But mice.</t3847>
<t3848>Ben: Mice can't really hurt you anyway.</t3848> <t3849>They are more afraid of you than you are of them.</t3849>
<t3850>Ben: But what about the mice?</t3850>
<t3851>Ben: Shut your mouth.</t3851>
<t3852>In the end, the mice didn't matter much because I was in a place where Margo was alive.</t3852> <t3853>I was in a place where she had been seen after me, and the warmth of that made this small shopping mall almost comfortable.</t3853> <t3854>So, I didn't feel like a baby being hugged by its mother or anything, but my breath no longer stopped every time I heard a sound.</t3854> <t3855>And being relaxed made it easier to do research.</t3855> <t3856>I knew there was more to be found, and now I felt ready to find it.</t3856>
<t3857>I crawled out of the office through a Dwarf Hole leading to a room with labyrinth-like shelves.</t3857> <t3858>I walked back and forth among them for a while.</t3858> <t3859>At the end of the room, I crawled through the next Dwarf Hole into an empty room.</t3859> <t3860>I sat on the rolled-up carpet in front of the opposite wall.</t3860> <t3861>The cracked white paint crackled behind my back.</t3861> <t3862>I stayed there for a while; long enough for the beam of light coming through the hole in the ceiling to shift a few centimeters on the floor as I let myself get used to the sounds.</t3862>
<t3863>After a while, I got bored and crawled through the last Dwarf Hole to the gift shop.</t3863> <t3864>I quickly looked at the t-shirts.</t3864> <t3865>I pulled the box of tourist brochures from under the display and examined the brochures, looking for a handwritten message from Margo, but I found nothing.</t3865>
<t3866>I returned to the room I now found myself calling the library.</t3866> <t3867>I flipped through the pages of Reader’s Digest with my finger and found a stack of National Geographic from the 1960s, but the box was so covered in dust that I knew Margo had never touched it.</t3867>
<t3868>However, when I returned to the empty room, I began to find evidence of human habitation.</t3868> <t3869>I discovered nine thumbtack holes in the cracked and peeling wall where a poster had been hung.</t3869> <t3870>Four of the holes formed a shape close to a square, and then five more were inside the square.</t3870> <t3871>I thought that Margo might have stayed here long enough to hang a few posters, but when we searched, there was nothing noticeably missing from her room.</t3871>
<t3872>I partially opened the drawer and found something else inside: a flattened, empty box that once contained twenty-four wafers.</t3872> <t3873>I could imagine Margo here, using the moldy carpet as a seat, leaning against the wall, and eating a wafer.</t3873> <t3874>Completely alone, with only these wafers as food.</t3874> <t3875>Maybe she goes to a market once a day to get a sandwich and a few Mountain Dews, but she spends most of her days here, on or beside this carpet.</t3875> <t3876>This vision seemed too pitiful to be real...</t3876> <t3877>it struck me that all of this was very lonely and very unMargo-like.</t3877> <t3878>But when all the evidence of the last ten days was accumulated, a surprising result emerged: even Margo herself was, at least sometimes, very unMargo-like.</t3878>
<t3879>I opened the carpet further and found an almost paper-thin blue knitted blanket.</t3879> <t3880>I took the blanket and held it up to my face and there, my God, yes...</t3880> <t3881>Margo's scent.</t3881> <t3882>Lilac shampoo, almond skin lotion, and beneath it all, the intoxicating sweetness of her skin.</t3882>
<t3883>And I could picture her again: Every night she would roll the carpet halfway open, so that when she lay on her side, her hip wouldn't rest on the bare concrete.</t3883> <t3884>She would crawl under the blanket, her honey</t3884>
<t3885>uses the rest as a pillow and sleeps.</t3885> <t3886>But why is she here?</t3886> <t3887>How could this place be better than home?</t3887> <t3888>And if it’s so great, why is she leaving?</t3888> <t3889>These are things I can’t imagine, and I realize that I can’t imagine them because I don’t know Margo.</t3889> <t3890>I knew how she smelled, I knew how she behaved in front of me, I knew how she behaved in front of others, I knew she loved Mountain Dew, adventure, and dramatic gestures, I knew she was fun, smart, and generally more than the rest of us.</t3890> <t3891>But I didn’t know what brought her here, or what kept her here, or what made her leave.</t3891> <t3892>I didn’t know why she had thousands of records, yet never told anyone she loved music.</t3892> <t3893>I didn’t know what she did at night, with the blinds closed, the door locked, in the secret privacy of her room.</t3893>
<t3894>And maybe this was what I needed to do before anything else.</t3894> <t3895>I needed to discover what Margo looked like when she wasn't being Margo.</t3895>
<t3896>I lay there for a while, staring at the ceiling with a blanket that smelled like him.</t3896> <t3897>Through a crack in the roof, I could see a thin piece of the sky in the afternoon, like a rough canvas painted bright blue.</t3897> <t3898>This would be a perfect place to sleep: One could see the stars at night without getting rained on.</t3898>
<t3899>I called my mom and dad to inform them.</t3899> <t3900>My dad answered, I told him that we were on the road with Radar and Angela and that I would stay at Ben's place for the night.</t3900> <t3901>He told me not to drink, and I told him I wouldn't, he said he was proud of me for going to the prom, and I wondered if he would be proud of me for what I was actually doing.</t3901>
<t3902>This place was boring.</t3902> <t3903>I mean, once you got past the rodents and the mysterious "building is falling apart" creaks, there was nothing to do.</t3903> <t3904>No internet, no television, no music.</t3904> <t3905>I was bored, so the fact that he had chosen this place puzzled me again; because</t3905>
<t3906>Margo had always caught my attention as a person with limited tolerance for boredom.</t3906> <t3907>Did she like the idea of living in a ruin?</t3907> <t3908>It was quite unlikely.</t3908> <t3909>Margo was wearing designer jeans while sneaking into SeaWorld.</t3909>
<t3910>It was the lack of an alternative stimulus that brought me back to My Own Song, the only gift I received from it.</t3910> <t3911>I moved to a water-stained part of the concrete floor, directly under the hole in the ceiling, sat cross-legged, and adjusted my body angle so that the light would illuminate the book.</t3911> <t3912>And somehow, I was finally able to read the poem.</t3912>
<t3913>The thing is, the poem starts very slowly...</t3913> <t3914>There is a kind of long introduction, but around the ninetieth line, Whitman finally starts telling a bit of a story, and this is where the poem picks up pace for me.</t3914> <t3915>In the end, Whitman is sitting idly on the grass (which he calls loafing) and then:</t3915>
<t3916>A child said, What is grass? bringing it to me in his hands;</t3916>
<t3917>How could I answer the child?</t3917> <t3918>I don't know what it is</t3918>
<t3919>more than him/her/it.</t3919>
<t3920>I suppose it must be a sign of my creation, emerging from the weave of promising greenery.</t3920>
<t3921>This was the hope that Dr. Holden talked about...</t3921> <t3922>The grass was a metaphor for Whitman's hope.</t3922> <t3923>But that's not all.</t3923> <t3924>It continues as follows:</t3924>
<t3925>Or maybe I think it's God's handkerchief,</t3925>
<t3926>A fragrant gift and a deliberately dropped keepsake,</t3926>
<t3927>As if the grass is a metaphor for something like the grandeur of God...</t3927>
<t3928>Or maybe I think the grass itself is a child...</t3928>
<t3929>And a little after this,</t3929>
<t3930>Or perhaps I think it is a monotonous hieroglyph,</t3930>
<t3931>And this means to sprout in wide areas and narrow areas without discrimination,</t3931>
<t3932>Growing up among white people as well as within black communities.</t3932>
<t3933>So maybe grass is a metaphor for our equality and fundamental interconnectedness, just as Dr. Holden said.</t3933> <t3934>And then finally, he says this about the grass:</t3934>
<t3935>And now it seems to me like the uncut beautiful hair of graves.</t3935>
<t3936>So, grass at the same time is death...</t3936> <t3937>growing out from our buried bodies.</t3937> <t3938>Grass simultaneously expressed so many different things that it was astonishing.</t3938> <t3939>So, grass was a metaphor for life, for death, for equality, for connectedness, for children, for God, and for hope.</t3939>
<t3940>I couldn't understand which of these ideas, if any, was the essence of the poem.</t3940> <t3941>But thinking about the grass and all the different ways to understand it made me think about all the ways I understood and misunderstood Margo.</t3941> <t3942>There was no lack of ways to see her.</t3942> <t3943>I had focused on what had happened to her, but now, with my mind trying to understand the variety of the grass and the scent of the blanket still in my nose, I realized that the most important question was whom I was searching for.</t3943> <t3944>If the question "What is grass?" has such a complex answer, I thought that the question "Who is Margo Roth Spiegelman?" must be the same.</t3944> <t3945>Like a metaphor that becomes incomprehensible because it is everywhere, in what she left for me,</t3945>
<t3946>there was enough room for endless dreams and an unlimited group of Margos.</t3946>
<t3947>I had to narrow Margo down and I thought there must be things here that I misunderstood or didn't understand.</t3947> <t3948>I wanted to hold and tear off the roof and light up this whole place so I could see everything at once instead of just one lantern light at a time.</t3948> <t3949>Putting Margo's blanket aside, I shouted loud enough for all the mice to hear, "I Will Find Something Here!"</t3949>
<t3950>I reviewed every desk in the office again, but it was becoming increasingly apparent that Margo only used the desk with nail polish in the drawer and the calendar set to June.</t3950>
<t3951>I crouched through a Dwarf Hole and walked back through the abandoned shelves, then proceeded in the library.</t3951> <t3952>I looked for dust-free shapes on each shelf that would show me Margo had used that area for something, but I found nothing.</t3952> <t3953>But then, my swiftly moving flashlight caught something at the top of a shelf in a corner of the room, just to the side of the store's boarded-up front window.</t3953> <t3954>It was the spine of a book.</t3954>
<t3955>The book had "Along the Road America: Your Travel Guide" written on it and was published in 1998, after this place was abandoned.</t3955> <t3956>I turned the pages of the book with the flashlight I had wedged between my neck and shoulder.</t3956> <t3957>The book listed hundreds of interesting places to visit; from the world's largest ball of twine in Darwin, Minnesota, to the world's largest ball of stamps in Omaha, Nebraska.</t3957> <t3958>Someone had seemingly randomly dog-eared many pages.</t3958> <t3959>The book wasn't very dusty.</t3959> <t3960>Maybe SeaWorld was just the first stop in a whirlwind adventure.</t3960> <t3961>Yes.</t3961> <t3962>This made sense.</t3962> <t3963>This was Margo.</t3963> <t3964>Somehow she had discovered this place, come here to gather supplies, spent a night or two, and then set off.</t3964> <t3965>I could imagine her going from one tourist trap to another.</t3965>
<t3966>As the last light escaped through the holes in the ceiling, I found other books on top of the other bookshelves.</t3966> <t3967>“Nepal Travel Guide”; “Canada’s</t3967>
<t3968>"Important Landscapes"; "America by Car"; "Fodor's Bahamas Guide"; "Let's Go to Bhutan".</t3968> <t3969>There seemed to be no connection between all these books, except that they were all about travel and all published after the mall had been abandoned.</t3969> <t3970>I wedged the Maglite under my chin, embraced the books in a stack that stretched from my waist to my chest, and carried them to the empty room I now imagined as a bedroom.</t3970>
<t3971>Thus, it felt like I spent the prom night with Margo, just not exactly as I had imagined.</t3971> <t3972>Instead of crashing the prom together, I sat on her messy blanket, leaning on the worn-out carpet, with cicadas chirping above and around me, sitting still in the dark and taking turns reading travel guides with a flashlight.</t3972>
<t3973>Maybe he too had sat here in the discordant darkness, feeling a kind of helplessness take hold of him, and perhaps it had seemed impossible not to think of death.</t3973> <t3974>I could imagine this, of course.</t3974>
<t3975>But I could also imagine this: that Margo had randomly found these books from various discount sales and bought all the travel guides she could get her hands on for a quarter or less.</t3975> <t3976>Then, even before she disappeared to read these books away from prying eyes, she had come here.</t3976> <t3977>Reading them while trying to decide where to go.</t3977> <t3978>Yes.</t3978> <t3979>She would travel in hiding; then, with the help of a gust of wind, she would cover hundreds of kilometers in a day, floating in the sky like a balloon.</t3979> <t3980>And in this dream, Margo was alive.</t3980> <t3981>Had she brought me here to give me the clues I needed to piece together a route?</t3981> <t3982>Maybe.</t3982> <t3983>Of course, I wasn't even close to a route.</t3983> <t3984>From what I could gather from the books, she could be in Jamaica, Namibia, Topeka, or Beijing.</t3984> <t3985>But I had just started looking.</t3985>
<t3986>In my room, while I was lying on my back, Margo's head was on my shoulder, with only the corner of the carpet and the concrete floor between us.</t3986> <t3987>Her arm was wrapped around my chest.</t3987> <t3988>We were just lying there, sleeping.</t3988> <t3989>God help me.</t3989> <t3990>The only young man in America who dreams of lying with girls, just lying.</t3990> <t3991>Then my phone rang.</t3991> <t3992>It took until the phone rang two more times for my clumsy hands to find the phone on the carpet.</t3992> <t3993>It was 3:18 AM.</t3993> <t3994>Ben was calling.</t3994> <t3995>"Good morning, Ben," I said.</t3995>
<t3996>“YESSS!” he screamed in response, and at that moment, I realized it was not a good time to try to explain to him everything I had learned and imagined about Margo.</t3996> <t3997>I could almost smell the alcohol on his breath.</t3997> <t3998>That single word, the way he shouted it, contained more exclamation marks than anything Ben had ever said to me in his entire life.</t3998>
<t3999>“So, I take it the ball is going well?</t3999><t4000>”</t4000>
<t4001>"YES! Quentin Jacobsen! Q! The greatest Quentin in America!</t4001> <t4002>Yes!" At that moment, his voice faded, but I could still hear him.</t4002> <t4003>"Guys, hey, shut up, wait, shut up...</t4003> <t4004>QUENTIN! JACOBSEN! INSIDE MY PHONE!" Then there was a cheer and Ben's voice returned.</t4004> <t4005>"Yes, Quentin! Yes! Brother, you need to come here.</t4005><t4006>"</t4006>
<t4007>“Where is that place?” I asked.</t4007>
<t4008>“Becca! Do you know where you are?</t4008><t4009>”</t4009>
<t4010>I knew exactly where it was.</t4010> <t4011>I had gone to Becca's basement.</t4011> <t4012>“I know where it is, but it's midnight, Ben.</t4012> <t4013>And right now I...</t4013><t4014>”</t4014>
<t4015>"YESSS! You must come immediately.</t4015> <t4016>Immediately!"</t4016>
<t4017>“Ben, daha önemli şeyler oluyor,” diye karşılık verdim.</t4017> <t4018>“DESIGNATED DRIVER!</t4018><t4019>”</t4019>
<t4020>“What?</t4020><t4021>”</t4021>
<t4022>“You are my designated sober driver!</t4022> <t4023>Yes! You are so chosen!</t4023> <t4024>I loved that you answered the phone!</t4024> <t4025>So awesome!</t4025> <t4026>I need to be home by six!</t4026> <t4027>And I choose you to take me there!</t4027> <t4028>YEEES!</t4028><t4029>”</t4029>
<t4030>"Can't you spend the night there?" I asked.</t4030>
<t4031>“NOOO! Boo.</t4031> <t4032>Boo Quentin.</t4032> <t4033>Hey, people! Boo Quentin!” And then I was booed.</t4033> <t4034>“Everyone is drunk.</t4034> <t4035>I'm drunk.</t4035> <t4036>Lacey is drunk.</t4036> <t4037>Radar is drunk.</t4037> <t4038>No one can drive.</t4038> <t4039>Home by six.</t4039> <t4040>I promised my mom.</t4040> <t4041>Boo, Sleepy Quentin! Long live the Designated Sober Driver! YES!</t4041><t4042>”</t4042>
<t4043>I took a deep breath.</t4043> <t4044>If Margo were going to show up, she would have appeared by the count of three.</t4044> <t4045>"I'll be there in half an hour!</t4045><t4046>"</t4046>
<t4047>“YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YEEEEEES YES! YES!</t4047><t4048>”</t4048>
<t4049>When I hung up the phone, Ben was still continuing with his affirmations.</t4049> <t4050>For a short while, I lay there, encouraging myself to get up, and then I got up.</t4050> <t4051>Still half-asleep, I crawled through the Dwarf Holes, passed through the library to the office, then pulled open the back door and got into the minivan.</t4051>
<t4052>I returned to Becca Arrington's neighborhood shortly before four in the morning.</t4052> <t4053>There were dozens of cars parked along both sides of Becca's street, and I knew there would be even more people inside because most of them had been dropped off by limousine.</t4053> <t4054>I found an empty spot a few cars away from SESIB.</t4054>
<t4055>I had never seen Ben drunk.</t4055> <t4056>Once, in tenth grade, I drank a bottle of pink "wine" at a band party.</t4056> <t4057>It was as bad going out as it was going in.</t4057> <t4058>Ben was the one sitting with me in Cassie Hiney's Winnie the Pooh-themed bathroom, as I vomited the pink liquid all over an Eeyore picture.</t4058> <t4059>I guess that experience soured both of us on alcohol-related events.</t4059> <t4060>At least until tonight.</t4060>
<t4061>Now, I knew Ben was going to get drunk.</t4061> <t4062>I had heard it on the phone.</t4062> <t4063>No sober person says "yes" that many times in a minute.</t4063> <t4064>However, after pushing past a few people smoking on the front lawn of Becca's place and opening the door to go inside, I did not expect to see Chase Worthington and two baseball players holding Ben, in a tuxedo, upside down over a beer keg.</t4064> <t4065>The hose from the beer keg was in Ben's mouth, and the whole room was focused on him.</t4065> <t4066>They were all chanting in unison, "Eighteen, nineteen, twenty," and for a moment, I thought they were messing with Ben.</t4066> <t4067>But no, as Ben sucked on that beer hose like it was his mother's milk, small streams of beer were running down the sides of his mouth because he was smiling.</t4067> <t4068>"Twenty-three, twenty-four, twenty-five," they shouted, and you could hear their excitement.</t4068> <t4069>Apparently, something remarkable was happening.</t4069>
<t4070>It all seemed so absurd, so shameful.</t4070> <t4071>They all looked like paper children making paper amusements.</t4071> <t4072>I made my way through the crowd towards Ben and was surprised when I ran into Radar and Angela.</t4072>
<t4073>“What is this nonsense?” I asked.</t4073>
<t4074>Radar stopped counting and looked at me.</t4074> <t4075>"Yes!" he said.</t4075> <t4076>"The Chosen Driver has arrived!</t4076> <t4077>Yes!</t4077><t4078>"</t4078>
<t4079>“Why is everyone saying 'yes' so much tonight?</t4079><t4080>”</t4080>
<t4081>“Good question,” shouted Angela.</t4081> <t4082>She puffed out her cheeks and sighed.</t4082> <t4083>She looked almost as bored as I was.</t4083>
<t4084>"Very true, a good question!" said Radar, holding a red plastic cup full of beer in each hand.</t4084>
<t4085>“Both of them are his,” Angela explained calmly.</t4085>
<t4086>“Why aren't you the chosen driver?” I asked.</t4086>
<t4087>“They wanted you,” he said.</t4087> <t4088>“They thought you would bring yourself here.”</t4088> <t4089>I rolled my eyes.</t4089> <t4090>He responded with the same feeling, rolling his own eyes.</t4090>
<t4091>“You must really like her,” I said, nodding my head towards Radar, who was holding both beers above his head, accompanying the counting.</t4091> <t4092>Everyone seemed quite proud of the fact that they could count.</t4092>
<t4093>“In a way, it's still charming even now,” he replied.</t4093>
<t4094>"Disgusting," I said.</t4094>
<t4095>Radar nudged me with one of the beer mugs.</t4095> <t4096>“Look at our son Ben!</t4096> <t4097>When it comes to keg stance, he becomes a kind of autistic savant.</t4097> <t4098>Apparently, right now he's breaking some sort of world record or something.</t4098><t4099>”</t4099>
<t4100>“What is the barrel stance?” I asked.</t4100>
<t4101>Angela pointed at Ben.</t4101> <t4102>"That one," she said.</t4102>
<t4103>‘Yeah,’ I said.</t4103> <t4104>‘Well, this...</t4104> <t4105>I mean, how hard could it be to hang upside down?</t4105><t4106>’</t4106>
<t4107>“The longest keg stand in Winter Park history was sixty-two seconds,” he explained.</t4107> <t4108>“And it was done by Tony Yorrick.”</t4108> <t4109>Tony was that huge kid who graduated when we were freshmen and now plays for the University of Florida's American football team.</t4109>
<t4110>Of course, I wholeheartedly believed that Ben would break the record, but while everyone was shouting, "Fifty-eight, fifty-nine, sixty, sixty-one, sixty-two, sixty-three!" I couldn't manage to join them.</t4110> <t4111>Then Ben pulled the hose out of his mouth and screamed: "YES! I MUST BE THE GREATEST! I TURNED THE WORLD UPSIDE DOWN!" Jase and a few baseball players picked Ben up, turned him right side up, and carried him around on their shoulders.</t4111> <t4112>Then Ben noticed me, pointing</t4112>
<t4113>He shouted with the highest, most passionate voice I had ever heard, "YEEES!"</t4113> <t4114>I mean, even football players wouldn't get this excited when they win the World Cup.</t4114>
<t4115>Ben jumped off the shoulders of the baseball players and landed awkwardly, then wobbled a bit as he stood up.</t4115> <t4116>He wrapped his arm around my shoulder.</t4116> <t4117>“YES!” he said again.</t4117> <t4118>“Quentin is here! The Big Man! Come on, make some noise for Quentin, the best friend of the world record holder in the barrel stance!” Jase rubbed my head and said, “My man!” then I heard Radar shouting right next to my ear: “We’re like folk heroes to these people.</t4118> <t4119>We left our prom after-party with Angela and came here because Ben said I would be welcomed like a king.</t4119> <t4120>So they were cheering and calling my name.</t4120> <t4121>Apparently, they all think Ben is really fun or something, and that’s why they like us too.</t4121><t4122>”</t4122>
<t4123>To Radar and everyone else, I said, "Wow."</t4123>
<t4124>Ben turned around, and I watched him catch and hold Cassie Hiney.</t4124> <t4125>His hands were on Cassie’s shoulders, Cassie put her hands on Ben’s shoulders, and Ben said, “My partner at the ball was almost the ball queen,” and Cassie said, “I know.</t4125> <t4126>This is wonderful,” and Ben said, “I’ve wanted to kiss you every day for the last three years,” and Cassie said, “I think you should,” and then Ben said, “YES! This is amazing,” he said.</t4126> <t4127>But he didn’t kiss Cassie.</t4127> <t4128>He just turned to me and said, “This is so amazing.”</t4128> <t4129>Then he started to act like he had forgotten both Cassie and me; as if the idea of kissing Cassie Hiney made him feel better than actually kissing her could.</t4129>
<t4130>Cassie said to me, "This party is great, isn't it?" and I said, "Yes," and she said, "It's like the opposite of band parties, isn't it?"</t4130> <t4131>And I said, "Yes," and she said, "I'm a fool but I love him."</t4131> <t4132>And I said, "Yes."</t4132> <t4133>"Besides, he really has green eyes," she added, and I said, "Uh-huh," then she said, "Everyone says you're cuter but I like Ben," and I said, "Okay," and she said, "This party is great, isn't it?"</t4133> <t4134>And I said, "Yes."</t4134>
<t4135>Talking to a drunk person was like talking to a three-year-old child who was extremely happy and had a severely damaged brain.</t4135>
<t4136>As Cassie walked away, Chuck Parson came towards me.</t4136> <t4137>"Jacobsen," he said, as if stating a fact.</t4137>
<t4138>“Parson,” I replied.</t4138>
<t4139>“You shaved my damn eyebrow, didn't you?</t4139><t4140>”</t4140>
<t4141>“I didn't actually shave,” I said.</t4141> <t4142>“I used a depilatory cream.</t4142><t4143>”</t4143>
<t4144>He poked me quite hard right in the middle of my chest.</t4144> <t4145>"You're a complete idiot," he said, but he was laughing.</t4145> <t4146>"This job requires some balls, my brother.</t4146> <t4147>Now you've become something like a puppet master.</t4147> <t4148>So maybe I'm just drunk, but right now I kind of like your idiot ass.</t4148><t4149>"</t4149>
<t4150>“Thank you,” I said.</t4150> <t4151>I felt so detached from all this nonsense, all this “high school is ending, so we must reveal that we deeply love each other” nonsense.</t4151> <t4152>And I imagined Margo at this party or at thousands like it.</t4152> <t4153>As if life had been drained from her eyes.</t4153> <t4154>I imagined her listening to Chuck Parson mumbling something to her and thinking about escape routes, escape routes involving life and death, and I could imagine both paths with equal clarity.</t4154>
<t4155>"Do you want a beer, saxophonist?" Chuck asked.</t4155> <t4156>I might have even forgotten he was there, but the smell of alcohol on his breath made it hard to ignore his presence.</t4156> <t4157>I just nodded and Chuck walked away.</t4157>
<t4158>I wanted to go home, but I knew I couldn't make Ben hurry.</t4158> <t4159>This was probably the only wonderful night of his life.</t4159> <t4160>He deserved it.</t4160>
<t4161>So I found a ladder and went down to the basement.</t4161> <t4162>I had been in the dark for so long that I still craved it, and I just wanted to lie down in a quiet, dark place and imagine Margo again.</t4162> <t4163>But from beside Becca's bedroom</t4163>
<t4164>As I was passing by, I heard some muffled sounds—more specifically, sounds like moaning—and because of this, I paused in front of the door that was left slightly ajar.</t4164>
<t4165>I could see two-thirds of Jase's upper body, he was shirtless, he was on top of Becca, and Becca had her legs wrapped around him.</t4165> <t4166>No one was naked or anything, but they were heading in that direction.</t4166> <t4167>Maybe a better person would have turned away, but people like me don't get many chances to see people like Becca Arrington naked, so I stayed there, spying on the room from the doorway.</t4167> <t4168>Then they rolled over and Becca got on top of Jason, she was sighing while kissing Jason and reaching down to take off her blouse.</t4168> <t4169>"Do you think I'm sexy?" she asked.</t4169>
<t4170>"God, yes, you are very sexy, Margo," said Jase.</t4170>
<t4171>“What!?” said Becca angrily, and it quickly became clear to me that I wouldn't see Becca naked.</t4171> <t4172>She started screaming; I backed away from the door; Jase noticed me and screamed, “What’s your problem?”</t4172> <t4173>Becca said, “Fuck him.</t4173> <t4174>Who cares about him?</t4174> <t4175>What about me?!</t4175> <t4176>Why are you thinking about Margo instead of me?” she shouted.</t4176>
<t4177>That moment seemed like the best time to get out of this situation, so I closed the door and went to the bathroom. I needed to pee, but what I needed more was to stay away from the sound of people.</t4177>
<t4178>After the entire team was properly adjusted, it always took me a few seconds to start peeing, so I stood there for a second, waiting; then I started to pee.</t4178> <t4179>Just as I was transitioning to the "full stream, shiver of relief" phase, a girl's voice from the bathtub area said, "Who's there?"</t4179>
<t4180>"Ah, Lacey?" I said.</t4180>
<t4181>"Quentin?</t4181> <t4182>What the hell are you doing here?" I wanted to stop peeing but of course, I couldn't; peeing, once you start, is like a good book that's very, very hard to put down.</t4182>
<t4183>“Eee, I'm peeing,” I said.</t4183>
<t4184>"How's it going?" he asked from behind the curtain.</t4184>
<t4185>"Hey, good?"</t4185> <t4186>I shook off the last drop, zipped up my shorts, and blushed.</t4186>
<t4187>“Do you want to hang out in the bathtub?” he asked.</t4187> <t4188>“This doesn't mean I'm giving the green light for sex.</t4188><t4189>”</t4189>
<t4190>After a short while, I said, "Of course."</t4190> <t4191>I opened the shower curtain.</t4191> <t4192>Lacey smiled at me, then pulled her knees up to her chest.</t4192> <t4193>I sat across from her, my back resting against the cold, sloped ceramic.</t4193> <t4194>Our legs were intertwined.</t4194> <t4195>Lacey was wearing shorts, a sleeveless t-shirt, and those cute little sandals.</t4195> <t4196>Her eye makeup was only slightly smudged.</t4196> <t4197>Her hair was partially up, still styled for the prom, and her legs were tanned.</t4197> <t4198>One had to admit that Lacey Pemberton was quite beautiful.</t4198> <t4199>She wasn't the kind of girl who could make you forget Margo Roth Spiegelman, but she was the kind of girl who could make you forget a lot of things.</t4199>
<t4200>“How was the ball?” I asked.</t4200>
<t4201>“I am really sweet,” she replied.</t4201> <t4202>“I had fun.</t4202> <t4203>But then I had a big fight with Becca, she called me a whore and then stood up on the couch and silenced the whole party and told everyone that I have a sexually transmitted disease.</t4203><t4204>”</t4204>
<t4205>I shuddered.</t4205> <t4206>“My God,” I said.</t4206>
<t4207>“Yes.</t4207> <t4208>You could say I was humiliated.</t4208> <t4209>This is just...</t4209> <t4210>My God.</t4210> <t4211>This is really awful, because...</t4211> <t4212>it's so degrading and he knew it would be and...</t4212> <t4213>this is awful.</t4213> <t4214>That's why I came to the bathtub, then Ben came down here and I told him to leave me alone.</t4214> <t4215>I didn't have a problem with Ben but he's not very good at listening and stuff.</t4215> <t4216>He's a bit drunk.</t4216> <t4217>I don't even have my illness.</t4217> <t4218>I did.</t4218> <t4219>It was treated.</t4219> <t4220>Anyway.</t4220> <t4221>But</t4221>
<t4222>I am not a slut.</t4222> <t4223>Just because of one child.</t4223> <t4224>God, I can't believe I even said that to him.</t4224> <t4225>I should have only told Margo when Becca wasn't around.</t4225><t4226>”</t4226>
<t4227>“I'm sorry,” I said.</t4227> <t4228>“The thing is, Becca is just jealous.</t4228><t4229>”</t4229>
<t4230>“Why would she be jealous?</t4230> <t4231>She is the prom queen.</t4231> <t4232>She is dating Jase.</t4232> <t4233>She is the new Margo.</t4233><t4234>”</t4234>
<t4235>My butt was hurting from the ceramic, so I tried to reposition myself.</t4235> <t4236>My knees were touching his knees.</t4236> <t4237>“No one will ever be the new Margo,” I said.</t4237> <t4238>“Anyway, you have what she wants.</t4238> <t4239>People like you.</t4239> <t4240>People think you're cuter.</t4240><t4241>”</t4241>
<t4242>Lacey hesitantly shrugged her shoulders.</t4242> <t4243>"Do you think I'm superficial?</t4243><t4244>"</t4244>
<t4245>“Well, yes.” I thought of myself standing outside the bedroom, hoping Becca would take off her blouse.</t4245> <t4246>“But I am too,” I added.</t4246> <t4247>“Everyone is.”</t4247> <t4248>Often, I would think, I wish I had Jase Worthington's body.</t4248> <t4249>If I walked as if I knew how to walk.</t4249> <t4250>If I kissed as if I knew how to kiss.</t4250>
<t4251>“But not in the same way.</t4251> <t4252>We are superficial in the same way, but you don't care if people like you.</t4252><t4253>”</t4253>
<t4254>This was both true and not true.</t4254> <t4255>"I care more than I want to," I said.</t4255>
<t4256>“Everything is awful without Margo,” he said.</t4256> <t4257>Lacey was also drunk, but her being drunk wasn't much of a problem.</t4257>
<t4258>"Yes," I said.</t4258>
<t4259>“I want you to take me to that place,” he said.</t4259> <t4260>“To that shopping mall.</t4260> <t4261>Ben told me about it from there.</t4261><t4262>”</t4262>
<t4263>“Yes, we can go whenever you want,” I said.</t4263> <t4264>I told her that I had been there all night, and that I had found Margo's nail polish and blanket.</t4264>
<t4265>Lacey remained silent for a while, breathing through her open mouth.</t4265> <t4266>When she finally spoke, she was almost whispering.</t4266> <t4267>Her words sounded like a question</t4267>
<t4268>a sentence uttered as an explanation: "He died, didn't he.</t4268><t4269>"</t4269>
<t4270>“I don't know, Lacey.</t4270> <t4271>Until tonight, I thought so, but now I don't know.</t4271><t4272>”</t4272>
<t4273>“He died and all of us...</t4273> <t4274>are doing these things.</t4274><t4275>”</t4275>
<t4276>I thought of Whitman underlined: "I shall be satisfied, even if no one in the world notices, / And I shall be satisfied, even if each and every one notices." "Maybe that's what he wants, for life to go on," I said.</t4276>
<t4277>“This doesn't sound like the Margo I know,” he said; I thought about my Margo, Lacey's Margo, Mrs. Spiegelman's Margo, and all of us, looking at her reflections in the different mirrors of amusement parks.</t4277> <t4278>I was about to say something, but Lacey's open mouth really turned into a slack jaw, and she leaned her head against the cold, gray tiles of the bathroom wall and fell asleep.</t4278>
<t4279>After two people came to the bathroom to pee, I decided to wake Lace up.</t4279> <t4280>It was five in the morning and I needed to take Ben home.</t4280>
<t4281>"Lace, wake up," I said, touching her slipper with my shoe.</t4281>
<t4282>He nodded.</t4282> <t4283>“I like being called that way,” he said.</t4283> <t4284>“You know, right now you are like my best friend.</t4284><t4285>”</t4285>
<t4286>“I am very happy,” I said, despite being drunk, tired, and lying.</t4286> <t4287>“Look, we will go upstairs together and if anyone says anything about you, I will defend your honor.</t4287><t4288>”</t4288>
<t4289>“Okay,” he said.</t4289> <t4290>And so we went upstairs together; the number of people at the party had dwindled a bit, but there were still a few baseball players, including Jase, by the keg.</t4290> <t4291>Mostly, there were people sleeping in sleeping bags all over the floor; some were crammed onto the pull-out couch.</t4291> <t4292>Angela and Radar were sprawled on a loveseat, Radar's legs dangling off the side.</t4292> <t4293>They were staying there for the night.</t4293>
<t4294>I was about to ask the children next to the barrel if they had seen Ben when Ben ran into the room.</t4294> <t4295>He was wearing a light blue cap on his head and holding a sword made of eight empty Milwaukee’s Best Light8 cans, which I thought were glued together.</t4295>
<t4296>“I SEE YOU!” shouted Ben, pointing at me with the sword.</t4296> <t4297>“I SAW QUENTEN JACOBSEN! YESSS! Come here! Get on your knees!” he shouted.</t4297>
<t4298>“What?</t4298> <t4299>Ben, calm down.</t4299><t4300>”</t4300>
<t4301>"DUCK!"</t4301>
<t4302>I knelt down obediently, looking at him.</t4302>
<t4303>Bira lowered the sword and lightly touched both of my shoulders.</t4303> <t4304>“In the name of the power of the super glue beer sword, I declare you my driver!</t4304><t4305>”</t4305>
<t4306>“Thank you,” I said.</t4306> <t4307>“Don't vomit in the car.</t4307><t4308>”</t4308>
<t4309>“YES!” he shouted.</t4309> <t4310>Then, when I tried to get up, he pushed me back with his free hand and lightly struck me again with the beer sword.</t4310> <t4311>“In the name of the power of the super-glued beer sword, I declare that you will be naked under your gown at graduation.</t4311><t4312>”</t4312>
<t4313>“What?” I stood up at that moment.</t4313>
<t4314>“YES! Me, you, and Radar! Naked under our robes!</t4314> <t4315>At graduation! It will be so awesome!</t4315><t4316>”</t4316>
<t4317>"Actually," I said, "it will be quite fiery.</t4317><t4318>"</t4318>
<t4319>“YES!” he said.</t4319> <t4320>‘Swear you will do it! I already made Radar swear.</t4320> <t4321>RADAR, DIDN'T YOU SWEAR?”</t4321>
<t4322>Radar slightly turned his head and opened his eyes.</t4322> <t4323>“I did,” he murmured.</t4323>
<t4324>“Well then, I swear too,” I said.</t4324>
<t4325>"YES!" Then Ben turned to Lacey.</t4325> <t4326>"I love you.</t4326><t4327>"</t4327>
<t4328>8 An American beer brand, (abbr.</t4328> <t4329>n.</t4329><t4330>)</t4330>
<t4331>“I love you too, Ben.</t4331><t4332>”</t4332>
<t4333>“No, I love you.</t4333> <t4334>Not like a girl loves her brother or a friend loves a friend.</t4334> <t4335>I love you like a drunk man loves the best girl he's ever met.”</t4335> <t4336>Lacey smiled.</t4336>
<t4337>I took a step forward, placing a hand on Ben's shoulder to try to save him from a greater embarrassment.</t4337> <t4338>"If we need to get you home by six, we should leave now," I said.</t4338>
<t4339>“Okay,” he said.</t4339> <t4340>“I just need to thank Becca for this amazing party.</t4340><t4341>”</t4341>
<t4342>So, with Lacey, we followed Ben downstairs, Ben opened the door to Becca's bedroom and said, "Your party was so good!</t4342> <t4343>Even though you were pretty awful!..</t4343> <t4344>It's like your heart pumps the liquid form of awfulness instead of blood!</t4344> <t4345>But thanks for the beer!” he said.</t4345> <t4346>Becca was lying alone on her sheets, staring at the ceiling.</t4346> <t4347>She didn't even look at Ben.</t4347> <t4348>She just muttered, "Oh, go to hell, shit face.</t4348> <t4349>I hope your girlfriend gives you pubic lice,” she mumbled.</t4349>
<t4350>Without the slightest hint of mockery in his voice, Ben replied, "It was great talking to you!" and closed the door.</t4350> <t4351>I don't think he has the slightest idea that he was just insulted.</t4351>
<t4352>Then we were upstairs again and getting ready to leave through the door.</t4352> <t4353>"I," I said, "you will have to leave your beer sword here.</t4353><t4354>"</t4354>
<t4355>“Right,” he said, I grabbed the tip of the sword and pulled hard, but Ben refused to let go.</t4355> <t4356>Just as I was about to start yelling at his drunken face, I realized I couldn't let go of the sword.</t4356>
<t4357>Lacey laughed.</t4357> <t4358>"Did you stick yourself to a beer sword?"</t4358><t4359>"</t4359>
<t4360>“No,” Ben replied.</t4360> <t4361>“I glued it super well.</t4361> <t4362>That way, no one can steal it from me!</t4362><t4363>”</t4363>
<t4364>“You’ve thought it through,” said Lacey with an emotionless expression.</t4364>
<t4365>We managed to tear off all my beer cans with Lacey, except for the one that was directly glued to Ben's hand with super glue.</t4365> <t4366>No matter how hard I pulled, Ben's hand remained loosely attached.</t4366>
<t4367>He followed the box, as if it were a string and his hand a puppet.</t4367> <t4368>Finally, Lacey said, "We should go."</t4368> <t4369>So we went.</t4369> <t4370>We strapped Ben into the back seat of the minivan with a seatbelt.</t4370> <t4371>Lacey sat next to him because she had to make sure he wouldn't throw up or beat himself to death with his own hand or something.</t4371><t4372>"</t4372>
<t4373>Ama Ben, Lacey'nin onun hakkında konuşurken rahat hissi 'demeyeceği kadar ileri gitmişti.</t4373> <t4374>Eyaletler arası yolda ilerlerken Lacey, "Bu kadar çabalaması biraz abartı.</t4374> <t4375>Yani fazla gayret ettiğini biliyorum ama bu, neden bu kadar kötü bir şey olsun ki?</t4375> <t4376>Aslında tatlı birisi, değil mi?" dedi bana.</t4376>
<t4377>"I suppose so," I said.</t4377> <t4378>Ben's head was bobbing around, apparently not attached to a spine.</t4378> <t4379>It hadn't left an impression of sweetness on me, but whatever.</t4379>
<t4380>First, I dropped Lacey off on the other side of Jefferson Park.</t4380> <t4381>When Lacey leaned in and planted a kiss on Ben's lips, Ben was animated enough to murmur, "Yes."</t4381>
<t4382>As Lacey walked towards the car, she approached the driver's side door.</t4382> <t4383>"Thank you," she said.</t4383> <t4384>I just nodded.</t4384>
<t4385>I drove the car to the other side of the neighborhood.</t4385> <t4386>It was neither night nor day.</t4386> <t4387>Ben was snoring quietly in the back.</t4387> <t4388>I pulled over in front of his house, got out, opened the sliding door of the minivan, and unbuckled the seatbelt.</t4388>
<t4389>“It's time to go home, Benners.</t4389><t4390>”</t4390>
<t4391>He sniffled, nodded his head, then woke up.</t4391> <t4392>He raised his hands to rub his eyes and seemed surprised when he found an empty Milwaukee’s Best Light can stuck to his right hand.</t4392> <t4393>He tried to make a fist and crushed the can a bit but didn’t remove it.</t4393> <t4394>He looked at the can for a short while, then nodded his head.</t4394> <t4395>“The monster9 has stuck to me,” he reported.</t4395>
<t4396>Milwaukee’s Best beer is also referred to as "The Beast" or "Canavar".</t4396> <t4397>(tr.</t4397> <t4398>n.</t4398><t4399>)</t4399>
<t4400>Mirlivandan stumbled out of the car and onto the sidewalk in front of his house, and when he stopped on the front porch, he turned around with a smile.</t4400> <t4401>I waved at him.</t4401> <t4402>He waved back.</t4402>
<t4403>I slept for a few hours and then spent the morning reviewing the travel guides I had discovered the previous day.</t4403> <t4404>I waited until noon to call Radar and Ben.</t4404> <t4405>I called Ben first.</t4405> <t4406>"Good morning, sunshine," I said.</t4406>
<t4407>“Oh, my God,” said Ben, the agony of disgrace flowing from his voice.</t4407> <t4408>“Oh, sweet Jesus, come and comfort your little brother Ben.</t4408> <t4409>Oh, my God.</t4409> <t4410>Wash the cursed one with your mercy.</t4410><t4411>”</t4411>
<t4412>“There have been many Margo developments,” I said excitedly, “so you need to come here.</t4412> <t4413>I will also call Radar.</t4413><t4414>”</t4414>
<t4415>Ben seemed like he hadn't heard me.</t4415> <t4416>"Hey, this morning when my mom came into my room at nine o'clock, while I was yawning and bringing my hand to my mouth, we both discovered that a beer can was stuck to my hand?</t4416><t4417>"</t4417>
<t4418>“To make a beer sword, you glued a bunch of beers together with super glue and then glued your hand to it.</t4418><t4419>”</t4419>
<t4420>“Ah, yes.</t4420> <t4421>The beer sword.</t4421> <t4422>This rings a bell.</t4422><t4423>”</t4423>
<t4424>“Ben, come here.</t4424><t4425>”</t4425>
<t4426>“Brother.</t4426> <t4427>I feel like crap.</t4427><t4428>”</t4428>
<t4429>"Then I should come to your house.</t4429> <t4430>How long will it take?" "Brother, you can't come here.</t4430> <t4431>I need to sleep for ten thousand hours.</t4431> <t4432>I need to drink ten thousand gallons of water and take ten thousand Advils.</t4432> <t4433>See you at school tomorrow.</t4433><t4434>"</t4434>
<t4435>I took a deep breath and tried not to sound angry.</t4435> <t4436>“I drove all the way across Florida in the middle of the night, staying sober at the world's drunkest party just to get your clumsy ass home, and this..</t4436> <t4437>I was going to continue talking, but I realized Ben had hung up.</t4437> <t4438>He had hung up on me.</t4438> <t4439>Jerk.</t4439>
<t4440>As time passed, I just got angrier.</t4440> <t4441>Not only did he not care about Margo at all...</t4441> <t4442>He didn't care about me either.</t4442> <t4443>Maybe our friendship had always been about the right circumstances...</t4443> <t4444>He had no one cooler than me to play computer games with.</t4444> <t4445>And now he didn't have to treat me well or care about the things I cared about because he had Jase Worthington.</t4445> <t4446>He had broken the school's keg stand record.</t4446> <t4447>He had a sexy prom date.</t4447> <t4448>He had jumped at the first opportunity to join the soulless jerks fraternity.</t4448>
<t4449>Five minutes after he hung up on me, I called his cell phone again.</t4449> <t4450>He didn't answer, so I left a message.</t4450> <t4451>“Do you want to be cool like Chuck, Bloody Ben?</t4451> <t4452>Is this what you've always wanted?</t4452> <t4453>Well, congratulations.</t4453> <t4454>Now it's in your hands.</t4454> <t4455>And you deserve it because you're crap too.</t4455> <t4456>Don't call back.</t4456><t4457>”</t4457>
<t4458>Then I called Radar.</t4458> <t4459>"Hey," I said.</t4459>
<t4460>"Hey," he said.</t4460> <t4461>"I just threw up in the shower.</t4461> <t4462>Can I call you later?</t4462><t4463>"</t4463>
<t4464>"Of course," I said, trying to hide the anger in my voice.</t4464> <t4465>I just wanted someone to help me unravel Margo's world.</t4465> <t4466>But Radar wasn't Ben; he called back only a few minutes later.</t4466>
<t4467>“It was so disgusting that I vomited while cleaning it, and then I vomited again while cleaning that up.</t4467> <t4468>Like a perpetual motion machine.</t4468> <t4469>If you had just kept feeding me, I could have continued vomiting like that forever.</t4469><t4470>”</t4470>
<t4471>“Can you come here?</t4471> <t4472>Or can I come to your house?</t4472><t4473>’</t4473>
<t4474>“Of course, Kvet.</t4474> <t4475>What happened?</t4475><t4476>”</t4476>
<t4477>"Margo was alive and was at the mall at least the night after she disappeared."</t4477><t4478></t4478>
<t4479>“I'm coming to you.</t4479> <t4480>Four minutes.</t4480><t4481>”</t4481>
<t4482>The Kıns appeared at my window exactly four minutes later.</t4482> <t4483>“You should know that I had a big fight with Im.,” I said, as he climbed inside.</t4483>
<t4484>“I'm too hungover to play mediator,” Radar replied quietly.</t4484> <t4485>He lay down on the bed, eyes half-closed, rubbing his shaved head.</t4485> <t4486>“I feel like I've been struck by lightning.”</t4486> <t4487>He sniffled.</t4487> <t4488>“Alright, give me the latest news.” I sat down on the chair and, trying not to omit any potentially useful detail, recounted my evening at Margo's vacation house to Radar.</t4488> <t4489>I knew Kadar was better at puzzles than I was, and I hoped he would piece together this puzzle.</t4489>
<t4490>“Then Ben called, and I went to the party,” he waited to speak until he said.</t4490>
<t4491>“Do you have that book, the one with the folded corners?” he asked.</t4491> <t4492>I got up and searched for the book under the bed, finally pulling it out.</t4492> <t4493>Radar lifted the book above his head, squinting at the pages with a headache.</t4493>
<t4494>‘Write this down,” he said.</t4494> <t4495>“Omaha, Nebraska.</t4495> <t4496>Sac City, Iowa.</t4496> <t4497>Alexandria, Indiana.</t4497> <t4498>Darwin, Minnesota.</t4498> <t4499>Hollywood, California.</t4499> <t4500>Alliance, Nebraska.</t4500> <t4501>Okay.</t4501> <t4502>These are all the places that Margo or whoever read this book found interesting.”</t4502> <t4503>He got out of bed, lifted me from the chair, and sat down at the computer.</t4503> <t4504>Radar had an amazing ability to keep a conversation going while typing on the computer.</t4504> <t4505>“There’s a mashup map application that lets you enter multiple destinations, and this program offers various routes</t4505>
<t4506>The technique of creating a new application or interface using multiple data sources, (e.</t4506> <t4507>g.</t4507><t4508>)</t4508>
<t4509>shows.</t4509> <t4510>Not that Margo would know this program...</t4510> <t4511>but I still want to see it.</t4511><t4512>”</t4512>
<t4513>“How do you know all this?” I asked.</t4513>
<t4514>“Hmm, reminder: Me.</t4514> <t4515>The Whole.</t4515> <t4516>My life.</t4516> <t4517>At Omnictionaıy.</t4517> <t4518>I spend it.</t4518> <t4519>In the hour between getting home this morning and taking a quick shower, I completely rewrote the blue spotted anglerfish page.</t4519> <t4520>I have a problem.</t4520> <t4521>Okay, look at this,” he said.</t4521> <t4522>I leaned down and saw a bunch of uneven routes drawn on a map of the United States.</t4522> <t4523>They all started in Orlando and ended in Hollywood, California.</t4523>
<t4524>“Maybe he will stay in Los Angeles?” suggested Radar.</t4524>
<t4525>“Maybe,” I said.</t4525> <t4526>“There's no way to know my route, though.</t4526><t4527>”</t4527>
<t4528>“Correct.</t4528> <t4529>Also, nothing else points to Los Angeles.</t4529> <t4530>What she told Jase points to New York.</t4530> <t4531>‘Go to the paper towns and never come back’ seems to indicate a nearby suburb.</t4531> <t4532>Maybe the nail polish still shows that she is around here, what do you think?</t4532> <t4533>I think we can now add the location of the world's largest popcorn ball to our list of possible Margo areas.</t4533><t4534>”</t4534>
<t4535>“Traveling aligns with one of Whitman's sayings: ‘I am slowly advancing on an eternal journey.</t4535><t4536>”’</t4536>
<t4537>Radar remained hunched over in front of the computer.</t4537> <t4538>I went to sit on the bed.</t4538> <t4539>"Hey, can you just pull up a map of the USA so I can pinpoint these locations," I said.</t4539>
<t4540>“I can do this on the internet too,” he said.</t4540>
<t4541>“Yes, but I want to be able to look at the map.”</t4541> <t4542>A few seconds later, the printer started working, and I placed the map of the USA next to the map on the wall where the neighborhoods were marked.</t4542> <t4543>I put a pin on the map for each of the six places marked in the book by Margo (or someone else).</t4543> <t4544>I tried to look at them like a constellation to see if they formed a shape or letter...</t4544> <t4545>but</t4545>
<t4546>I couldn't see anything.</t4546> <t4547>It was a completely random distribution, as if Margo had blindfolded herself and thrown darts at a map.</t4547>
<t4548>I sighed.</t4548> <t4549>“Do you know what would be great?” asked Radar.</t4549> <t4550>“If we could find any evidence that she checks her email or any place on the internet.</t4550> <t4551>I search for her name every day; I have an automatic program that will alert me if she logs into Omnictionary with that username.</t4551> <t4552>I track the IP addresses of people searching for the term ‘paper towns’.</t4552> <t4553>It's incredibly frustrating.</t4553><t4554>”</t4554>
<t4555>"I didn't know you did all this," I said.</t4555>
<t4556>“Yes, well.</t4556> <t4557>I'm only doing what I would ask someone else to do.</t4557> <t4558>I know I'm not friends with him, but he deserves to be found.</t4558><t4559>”</t4559>
<t4560>“As long as he wants to be found.</t4560><t4561>”</t4561>
<t4562>“Yes, I think it is possible that he doesn't want to.</t4562> <t4563>Everything is still possible.”</t4563> <t4564>I nodded.</t4564> <t4565>“Yes, well... okay,” he said.</t4565> <t4566>“Can we brainstorm during the computer game?</t4566><t4567>”</t4567>
<t4568>“I'm really not in the mood.</t4568><t4569>”</t4569>
<t4570>“Then can we call Ben?</t4570><t4571>”</t4571>
<t4572>“No.</t4572> <t4573>I'm a complete asshole.</t4573><t4574>”</t4574>
<t4575>Radar looked at me intently.</t4575> <t4576>"Of course it is.</t4576> <t4577>Do you know what your problem is, Quentin? You expect people not to be themselves.</t4577> <t4578>I mean, I could hate that you are consistently late, that you are only interested in Margo Roth Spiegelman, and that you never ask me how things are going with my girlfriend, but I don't care, man, because you are you.</t4578> <t4579>My parents have a ton of black Santa Clauses, but that's not a problem either.</t4579> <t4580>They are who they are.</t4580> <t4581>Sometimes I am so obsessed with a reference site that I don't answer the phone when my friends or girlfriend call.</t4581> <t4582>That's not a problem either.</t4582> <t4583>That's me.</t4583> <t4584>Every</t4584>
<t4585>In any case, you love me.</t4585> <t4586>And I love you too.</t4586> <t4587>You are fun and smart, and you may come late but eventually, you will come.</t4587><t4588>"</t4588>
<t4589>“Thank you.</t4589><t4590>”</t4590>
<t4591>“Yes, well.</t4591> <t4592>I wasn't complimenting you.</t4592> <t4593>I'm just saying: Stop thinking that IkM should be like you and let it stop thinking that you should be like it, and for heaven's sake, both of you calm down.</t4593><t4594>”</t4594>
<t4595>“Alright,” I said finally and called Ben.</t4595> <t4596>The news that Radar was ImrtU and wanted to play a computer game miraculously cured his evening stay.</t4596>
<t4597>“Okay,” I said after hanging up the phone.</t4597> <t4598>“How is Angela?</t4598><t4599>"</t4599>
<t4600>Radar laughed.</t4600> <t4601>"Good, my friend.</t4601> <t4602>Really good.</t4602> <t4603>Thanks for asking.</t4603><t4604>"</t4604>
<t4605>"Are you still a virgin?" I asked.</t4605>
<t4606>“I cannot violate privacy.</t4606> <t4607>However, yes.</t4607> <t4608>Oh, and we had our first argument this morning.</t4608> <t4609>We were having breakfast at Waffle House, and Angela was talking about how amazing black Santas are, how wonderful my parents are for collecting them, because it’s so important not to assume that everyone accepts the idea that God and Santa Claus are white in our culture, and how black Santas empower the entire black community.</t4609><t4610>”</t4610>
<t4611>"I think I agree with him in a way," I said.</t4611>
<t4612>“Well, it's a good idea but nonsense.</t4612> <t4613>My parents are not trying to spread the black Santa Claus.</t4613> <t4614>If they were, they would make a black Santa Claus, but instead, they are trying to buy the entire world stock.</t4614> <t4615>There is a man in Pittsburgh who has the second largest collection in the world, and they are constantly trying to buy the collection from him,"</t4615>
<t4616>litMi lui|>ı ('.</t4616> <t4617>He called out from the darkness.</t4617> <t4618>He had been there for a while, it seemed, the failure to capture that nimble little rabbit being a symbol of our era's human tragedy.</t4618> <t4619>"</t4619>
<t4620>"My reputation, Me?" I said.</t4620>
<t4621>"Thank you for leaving the package, brother.</t4621><t4622>"</t4622>
<t4623>Despite only one week remaining until the exams, I spent Monday night reading My Own Song.</t4623> <t4624>I had wanted to go to the last two semi-districts, but Ben had to drive the car.</t4624> <t4625>I was no longer searching for clues in the poem as much as I was searching for Margo herself.</t4625> <t4626>When I reached another section that I found myself reading over and over again, I had managed to get halfway through My Own Song this time.</t4626>
<t4627>“I guess I will do nothing for a long time but listen,” writes Whitman.</t4627> <t4628>Then for two pages, he just hears: he hears the whistle of a steam, he hears the voices of people, he hears an opera.</t4628> <t4629>He sits on the grass and lets the sounds pass through him.</t4629> <t4630>And I guess that’s what I’m trying to do too: listen to all of Margo’s little sounds.</t4630> <t4631>Because before they mean anything, they must be heard.</t4631> <t4632>I hadn’t really heard Margo for a long time—I had seen her scream and thought she laughed—and now I understood that it was my job, even from this immense distance, to try to hear her opera.</t4632>
<t4633>If I couldn't hear Margo, at least I could listen to what she once heard, so I downloaded albums where Woody Guthrie's songs were rearranged.</t4633> <t4634>I sat at the computer, eyes closed, elbows resting on the table, listening to the singing voice.</t4634> <t4635>In a song I had never heard before, I tried to hear that voice which I struggled to remember twelve days later.</t4635>
<t4636>I was still listening when my mother came home...</t4636> <t4637>but now to another of her favorites, Bob Dylan.</t4637> <t4638>"Your father will be late," my mother said from behind the closed door.</t4638> <t4639>"I thought I could make turkey meatballs, but?..</t4639><t4640>"</t4640>
<t4641>“Very nice,” I replied, then I closed my eyes again and listened to the music.</t4641> <t4642>I didn't straighten up from where I was sitting until my father called me for dinner when I was halfway through the second album.</t4642>
<t4643>At dinner, my mom and dad were talking about Middle Eastern politics.</t4643> <t4644>Despite being in complete agreement with each other, they still managed to shout that so-and-so is a liar, so-and-so is a liar and a thief, and that most of them should resign.</t4644> <t4645>I focused on the turkey meatball, which was delicious with ketchup and covered in onions.</t4645>
<t4646>“Alright, that's enough,” said my mother after a while.</t4646> <t4647>“Quentin, how was your day?</t4647><t4648>”</t4648>
<t4649>“Good,” I said.</t4649> <t4650>“I guess I'm preparing for the exams.</t4650><t4651>”</t4651>
<t4652>“I can't believe this is the last week of his school,” said my dad.</t4652> <t4653>“It really feels like it was just yesterday...</t4653><t4654>”</t4654>
<t4655>“Yes,” said my mother.</t4655> <t4656>A voice in my head started shouting: WARNING NOSTALGIA ALARM, WARNING WARNING WARNING.</t4656> <t4657>My parents are wonderful people but they tend to show paralyzing displays of excessive sentimentality.</t4657>
<t4658>"We are proud of you," said my mother.</t4658> <t4659>"My God, we will miss you next fall.</t4659><t4660>"</t4660>
<t4661>“Yes, well, don't speak too soon.</t4661> <t4662>I can still fail literature.</t4662><t4663>”</t4663>
<t4664>My mom laughed and then said, "Ah, guess who I saw at the Young Men's Christian Association yesterday?</t4664> <t4665>Betty Parson.</t4665> <t4666>She said that Chuck will be going to Georgia University next fall.</t4666> <t4667>I'm happy for him; he always struggled.</t4667><t4668>"</t4668>
<t4669>"What an idiot," I said.</t4669>
<t4670>“Well,” said my father, “he was a bully.</t4670> <t4671>And his behavior was deplorable.”</t4671> <t4672>This was typical of my parents: According to them, no one was just lousy, there was always something else wrong with people besides just being awful: They had social adaptation disorders...</t4672> <t4673>or personality disorders or whatever.</t4673>
<t4674>My mom took control.</t4674> <t4675>“But Chuck has learning difficulties.</t4675> <t4676>He has all sorts of problems...</t4676> <t4677>just like everyone else.</t4677> <t4678>I know it's hard for you to see your peers this way, but when you get older, you'll start to see the bad kids, the good kids, and all the kids as people.</t4678> <t4679>They are just people who deserve to be cared about.</t4679> <t4680>Different degrees of sick, different degrees of neurotic, different degrees of accomplished.</t4680> <t4681>But you know, I've always liked Betty and I've always had hope for Chuck.</t4681> <t4682>So it's good that he's going to college, don't you think?</t4682><t4683>”</t4683>
<t4684>"Honestly, mom, one way or another, I don't really care about him."</t4684> <t4685>But I thought, if everyone is just human, how is it that my mom and dad still</t4685> <t4686>hated all the politicians in Israel and Palestine?</t4686> <t4687>They didn't talk about them as if they were human.</t4687>
<t4688>My father finished chewing something and then put down his fork and looked at me.</t4688> <t4689>"The longer I do my job," he said, "the more I realize that people lack good mirrors.</t4689> <t4690>It's so hard for someone to show us how we look and for us to show someone how we feel.</t4690><t4691>"</t4691>
<t4692>“This is really nice,” said my mother.</t4692> <t4693>I liked that they liked each other.</t4693> <t4694>“But fundamentally, isn't it difficult for us to understand that other people are human just like us?</t4694> <t4695>We idealize them as gods or reject them as animals.</t4695><t4696>”</t4696>
<t4697>“Correct.</t4697> <t4698>Consciousness also leads to narrow windows.</t4698> <t4699>I don't think I've ever thought about it this way.</t4699><t4700>”</t4700>
<t4701>I was leaning back.</t4701> <t4702>I was listening.</t4702> <t4703>And I was hearing something about Margo, windows, and mirrors.</t4703> <t4704>Chuck Parson</t4704>
<t4705>He was a person.</t4705> <t4706>Like me.</t4706> <t4707>Margo Roth Spiegelman was also a person.</t4707> <t4708>And I had never thought of her this way, not exactly; this was the failure of all my previous conceptions.</t4708> <t4709>From the very beginning—not just since she left, but for the past ten years—I had imagined Margo without listening, without knowing that she had created a window as narrow as mine.</t4709> <t4710>And because of this, I couldn't conceive of her as a person; someone who could be scared, who could feel excluded in a room full of people, who could be shy about her record collection because it was too personal to share.</t4710> <t4711>Someone who could read travel guides to escape to a city where many people flee to live.</t4711> <t4712>Someone who really had no one to talk to because no one thought of her as a person.</t4712>
<t4713>And suddenly I understood how Margo Roth Spiegelman felt when she wasn't Margo Roth Spiegelman: She felt empty.</t4713> <t4714>She felt surrounded by walls that couldn't be climbed.</t4714> <t4715>I thought of her sleeping on the carpet, with only that narrow piece of sky above her.</t4715> <t4716>Maybe Margo felt comfortable there because the human Margo always lived like this: In an abandoned room with closed windows, the only light coming from the holes in the roof.</t4716> <t4717>Yes.</t4717> <t4718>The main mistake I always made, and to be honest, the one she always led me to make, was this: Margo was not a miracle.</t4718> <t4719>She was not an adventure.</t4719> <t4720>She was not something good and precious.</t4720> <t4721>She was a teenage girl.</t4721>
<t4722>The clock was always punitive, but feeling that I was close to untying the knots made the day of the event seem like time had completely stopped.</t4722> <t4723>We had all decided to go to the mall right after school, and the wait was unbearable.</t4723> <t4724>When the bell finally rang, signaling the end of the literature class, I ran downstairs and was almost out the door when I realized we couldn't leave until Ben and Radar finished band practice.</t4724> <t4725>I sat outside the band room and took out a single-serving pizza wrapped in napkins that I had saved since lunch from my backpack.</t4725> <t4726>I had finished the first quarter when Lacey Pemberton sat down next to me.</t4726> <t4727>I offered her a slice too.</t4727> <t4728>She declined.</t4728>
<t4729>Of course, we talked about Margo.</t4729> <t4730>Our common problem.</t4730> <t4731>"The thing I need to figure out," I said, wiping the pizza grease on my jeans, "is a place.</t4731> <t4732>But I don't even know if I'm getting closer to solving it with the clues.</t4732> <t4733>Sometimes I think we're heading in a completely unrelated direction.</t4733><t4734>"</t4734>
<t4735>“Yes.</t4735> <t4736>I don't know.</t4736> <t4737>Honestly, above all, I love discovering things about him.</t4737> <t4738>Things I didn't know before, that is.</t4738> <t4739>I have no idea who he really is.</t4739> <t4740>Honestly, I never thought of him as anyone other than a crazy and beautiful friend who does insanely beautiful things.</t4740><t4741>”</t4741>
<t4742>“True, but he didn't do these things on a whim,” I said.</t4742> <t4743>“I mean, all his adventures had a certain...</t4743> <t4744>I don't know.</t4744><t4745>”</t4745>
<t4746>“Grace,” said Lacey.</t4746> <t4747>“She is the only person I know who is not an adult and possesses complete grace.</t4747><t4748>”</t4748>
<t4749>“Yes.</t4749><t4750>”</t4750>
<t4751>“That's why it's hard to imagine him in a lightless, disgusting, dusty room.</t4751><t4752>”</t4752>
<t4753>“Yes,” I said.</t4753> <t4754>“With the mice.</t4754><t4755>”</t4755>
<t4756>Lacey pulled her knees to her chest and curled into a fetal position.</t4756> <t4757>"Eww.</t4757> <t4758>This is not like Margo at all.</t4758><t4759>"</t4759>
<t4760>Even though she was somehow the shortest of us, Lacey sat in the front seat.</t4760> <t4761>Ben was driving the car.</t4761> <t4762>When Radar, who was sitting next to me, took out his handheld computer and started working on Omnictionary, I sighed quite loudly.</t4762>
<t4763>“I am just deleting the vandalism on the Chuck Norris page,” he said.</t4763> <t4764>“For example, although I think Chuck Norris is an expert in flying kicks, I don't think it's right to say this: ‘Chuck Norris's tears can cure cancer, but unfortunately, he has never cried.’</t4764> <t4765>Anyway, deleting vandalism occupies about four percent of my brain.</t4765><t4766>”</t4766>
<t4767>I understood that Radar was trying to make me laugh, but I only wanted to talk about one thing.</t4767> <t4768>‘I am not convinced that Margo is in any part of town.</t4768> <t4769>Maybe this is not even what she meant by ‘paper towns’.</t4769> <t4770>There are a lot of hints, but nothing specific.</t4770><t4771>”</t4771>
<t4772>Radar lifted his head for a second, then turned back to the screen.</t4772> <t4773>“Personally, I think the chest, which I left enough clues to be understood, has gone very far away on a ridiculous trip.</t4773> <t4774>So right now, I think he's visiting the world's largest ball of stamps in Omaha, Nebraska, or checking out the world's largest ball of yarn in Minnesota or something.</t4774><t4775>”</t4775>
<t4776>Ben glanced in the rearview mirror and said, "So you think Margo is on a national tour chasing The Biggest Balls in Kenya?"</t4776> <t4777>Radar nodded in agreement.</t4777>
<t4778>“Well,” Ben continued, “someone needs to tell him to come home now, because he can find the world's largest balls right here in Orlando, Florida.</t4778> <t4779>They are placed in a special showcase known as ‘My Testicles’.</t4779><t4780>”</t4780>
<t4781>Radar laughed and Ben continued: ‘I mean, seriously.</t4781> <t4782>They are as big as my balls, when you order fries from McDonald’s, you can choose from four sizes: small, medium, large, and my balls.”</t4782> <t4783>Lacey glanced at Ben out of the corner of her eye.</t4783> <t4784>“Not.</t4784> <t4785>Appropriate.</t4785> <t4786>At all.” “Sorry,” Ben muttered.</t4786> <t4787>“I think she’s in Orlando,” he said.</t4787> <t4788>“Watching us search for her.</t4788> <t4789>And watching her parents not search for her.”</t4789> <t4790>“I still say New York,” said Lacey.</t4790>
<t4791>“It’s all still possible,” I said.</t4791> <t4792>For each of us, a Margo... and each one resembles a mirror more than a window.</t4792>
<t4793>The small shopping mall looked the same as it did a few days ago.</t4793> <t4794>I parked the car and led them through the door, pushing it open, and took them to the office.</t4794> <t4795>As soon as everyone entered, I quietly said, “Don't turn on the lights yet.</t4795> <t4796>Give your eyes a chance to adjust,” I said.</t4796> <t4797>I felt nails digging into my arm.</t4797> <t4798>“It's okay, Lace,” I whispered.</t4798>
<t4799>“Yes,” he said.</t4799> <t4800>“Wrong arm.”</t4800> <t4801>I realized he was looking for Ben.</t4801> <t4802>Slowly, the room took on a hazy gray appearance.</t4802> <t4803>I could still see the lined-up desks, waiting for the workers.</t4803> <t4804>I turned on my flashlight and then the others turned on theirs.</t4804> <t4805>Ben and Lacey stayed together, heading towards the Dwarf Hole to examine the other rooms.</t4805> <t4806>Radar walked with me towards Margo’s desk.</t4806> <t4807>He knelt down to take a closer look at the paper calendar frozen in June.</t4807>
<t4808>When I heard the fast approaching footsteps, I was leaning towards Radar.</t4808>
<t4809>“There are thousands,” Ben whispered hurriedly.</t4809> <t4810>Pulling Lacey, he crouched behind Margo's desk.</t4810>
<t4811>“What? Where?</t4811><t4812>”</t4812>
<t4813>"They're in that room!" he said.</t4813> <t4814>"They are wearing masks.</t4814> <t4815>They look official.</t4815> <t4816>We need to go.</t4816><t4817>"</t4817>
<t4818>He aimed the radar flashlight at the Dwarf Hole, but Ben struck it forcefully, knocking the flashlight to the ground.</t4818> <t4819>“From here.</t4819> <t4820>We must.</t4820> <t4821>Get out.” Lacey was looking at me with wide eyes and, probably mistakenly, a bit angry because I had promised her we would be safe.</t4821>
<t4822>"Okay," I whispered.</t4822> <t4823>"Okay, everyone out, through the door.</t4823> <t4824>Very calmly, very quickly."</t4824> <t4825>I had just started to walk when I heard a booming voice shout.</t4825> <t4826>"WHO'S THERE!</t4826><t4827>"</t4827>
<t4828>Damn it.</t4828> <t4829>“Well,” I said, “we're just wandering around.”</t4829> <t4830>It was an extremely terrifying thing to say.</t4830> <t4831>The white light coming from the Dwarf Hole blinded me.</t4831> <t4832>This could have even been Tann himself.</t4832>
<t4833>"What is your intention?"</t4833> <t4834>There was a faint hint of a fake English accent in this voice.</t4834>
<t4835>I watched Ben stand up beside me.</t4835> <t4836>It felt good not to be alone.</t4836> <t4837>“We’re here to investigate a disappearance,” he said with great confidence.</t4837> <t4838>“We weren’t going to break anything.”</t4838> <t4839>The light went out, and I blinked away the blindness until I saw three silhouettes, both wearing jeans, t-shirts, and masks with two filters.</t4839> <t4840>One of them lifted his mask to his forehead and looked at us.</t4840> <t4841>I recognized this goatee, straight and wide mouth.</t4841>
<t4842>“Gus?” asked Lacey.</t4842> <t4843>She stood up.</t4843> <t4844>The SunTrust security guard.</t4844>
<t4845>"Lacey Pemberton.</t4845> <t4846>My God.</t4846> <t4847>What are you doing here?</t4847> <t4848>And without a mask?</t4848> <t4849>There's a ton of asbestos here.</t4849><t4850>"</t4850>
<t4851>“What are you doing here?</t4851><t4852>”</t4852>
<t4853>“I am investigating,” he said.</t4853> <t4854>Somehow, Ben had become confident enough to approach the other men and extend his hand to shake theirs.</t4854>
<t4855>They introduced themselves as As and Carpenter.</t4855> <t4856>I'll bet these were their pseudonyms.</t4856>
<t4857>We pulled a few swivel chairs from around and sat in a circle.</t4857> <t4858>“Did you break the chipboard?” Gus asked.</t4858>
<t4859>"Well, I broke it," Ben explained.</t4859>
<t4860>"We taped it ourselves because we didn't want anyone else to come inside.</t4860> <t4861>If people see a way to get in from the road, many who don't know a damn thing about the research will come inside.</t4861> <t4862>Beggars, junkies, and the like.</t4862><t4863>"</t4863>
<t4864>I took a step towards them.</t4864> <t4865>"So, do you, um, know that Margo came here?" I said.</t4865>
<t4866>Before Gus could answer, As spoke from behind the mask.</t4866> <t4867>His voice had slightly changed, but it was easy to understand.</t4867> <t4868>“Dude, Margo was here all this damn time.</t4868> <t4869>We only come here a few times a year; there's asbestos here, and it's not even that good of a place.</t4869> <t4870>But probably, in the last few years when we came here, I mean, we saw her around half the time.</t4870> <t4871>She was sexy, wasn't she?</t4871><t4872>”</t4872>
<t4873>“What?” Lacey asked meaningfully.</t4873>
<t4874>“He ran away, didn't he?</t4874><t4875>”</t4875>
<t4876>“What do you know about this?” asked Lacey.</t4876>
<t4877>"Nothing.</t4877> <t4878>I saw Margo with him," said Gus, nodding his head towards me, "a few weeks ago.</t4878> <t4879>Then I heard she ran away.</t4879> <t4880>A few days later, it occurred to me that she might be here, so we came here.</t4880><t4881>"</t4881>
<t4882>“I never understood why you like this place so much.</t4882> <t4883>There isn't much here,” said the Carpenter.</t4883> <t4884>“It's not good for exploration.</t4884><t4885>”</t4885>
<t4886>Lacey asked Gus, "What do you mean by discovery?"</t4886>
<t4887>“Urban exploration.</t4887> <t4888>We enter abandoned buildings, explore them, take photographs.</t4888> <t4889>We take nothing; we leave nothing.</t4889> <t4890>We are just observers.</t4890><t4891>”</t4891>
<t4892>“This is a hobby,” said As.</t4892> <t4893>“When we were still in school, Gus allowed Margo to follow him on his expeditions.</t4893><t4894>”</t4894>
<t4895>“He had an amazing eye, even though he was about thirteen years old,” said Gus.</t4895> <t4896>“He always found a way to get into everywhere.</t4896> <t4897>Back then, we would go whenever we had the chance, but now we go out about three times a week.</t4897> <t4898>There are places like this everywhere.</t4898> <t4899>There’s an abandoned mental hospital in Clearwater.</t4899> <t4900>It’s astonishing.</t4900> <t4901>You can see the place where they used to strap down the insane and give them electroshock therapy.</t4901> <t4902>And to the west of here, there’s an old prison.</t4902> <t4903>But Margo wasn’t too interested.</t4903> <t4904>She liked breaking into places but then just wanted to stay there.</t4904><t4905>”</t4905>
<t4906>“Yes, my God, that was very annoying,” added As.</t4906>
<t4907>The carpenter said, "He wouldn't even take photos or anything.</t4907> <t4908>Nor would he run around finding things.</t4908> <t4909>He just wanted to come in and sit down or something.</t4909> <t4910>Do you remember that black notebook of his?</t4910> <t4911>He would just sit in a corner and write, as if he were at home doing homework or something," he said.</t4911>
<t4912>“Honestly,” said Gus, “he never really understood what all this was about.</t4912> <t4913>Adventure.</t4913> <t4914>He actually seemed to be depressed.</t4914><t4915>”</t4915>
<t4916>I wanted them to keep talking because I thought everything they said would help me imagine Margo.</t4916> <t4917>But suddenly, Lacey stood up and kicked her chair back.</t4917> <t4918>"And you, you never thought to ask her why she was actually depressed, did you?</t4918> <t4919>Or why she hung out in these crappy places?</t4919> <t4920>Didn't that ever bother you?"</t4920> <t4921>She was now standing over Gus, shouting.</t4921> <t4922>Gus stood up too, he was fifteen centimeters taller than Lacey, and then Carpenter said, "God, someone calm this whore down."</t4922>
<t4923>“Ah, you shouldn't have said that!” shouted Ben, and before I could understand what was happening, Ben attacked the Carpenter, who fell awkwardly over his shoulder from his chair.</t4923> <t4924>Ben spread his legs and sat on top of the man, slapping and punching his mask both angrily and clumsily.</t4924>
<t4925>“THE WHORE ISN'T HER, IT'S YOU!” she shouted, starting to beat the man.</t4925> <t4926>I stood up and grabbed Radar's arm while Ben grabbed and held his other arm.</t4926> <t4927>We pulled him away, but he was still shouting.</t4927> <t4928>“I am very angry right now!</t4928> <t4929>I enjoy punching this man!</t4929> <t4930>I want to keep punching him!</t4930><t4931>”</t4931>
<t4932>“Ben,” I said, trying to make my voice sound calm, trying to make my voice sound like my mother's.</t4932> <t4933>“Ben, everything is fine.</t4933> <t4934>We understood what you meant.</t4934><t4935>”</t4935>
<t4936>Gus and As lifted the Carpenter off the ground, and Gus said, "God, we're getting out of here, okay?</t4936> <t4937>This place is all yours," he said.</t4937>
<t4938>They gathered my camera equipment and hurriedly exited through the back door.</t4938> <t4939>Lacey started to explain to me how she knew Gus.</t4939> <t4940>“He was a senior, we...”</t4940> <t4941>But I interrupted her by waving my hand.</t4941> <t4942>None of it mattered anyway.</t4942>
<t4943>Radar knew what was important.</t4943> <t4944>He immediately turned to the calendar, his eyes were three centimeters away from the paper.</t4944> <t4945>“I don't think anything was written on the May page,” he said.</t4945> <t4946>“The paper is quite thin and I can't see any marks.</t4946> <t4947>But it's impossible to say for sure.”</t4947> <t4948>He moved away to look for more clues and as they passed through the Dwarf Hole, I saw the light from Lacey and Ben’s flashlights dim, but I just stood there in the office, imagining Margo.</t4948> <t4949>I thought about her following these men, who were four years older than her, into abandoned buildings.</t4949> <t4950>This was the Margo I saw.</t4950> <t4951>But then, inside the buildings, she stops being the Margo I always imagined.</t4951> <t4952>While everyone else is exploring, taking photos, and jumping over walls, Margo sits on the ground writing something.</t4952>
<t4953>Ben shouted from the side door: "Q!</t4953> <t4954>We found something!</t4954><t4955>"</t4955>
<t4956>I wiped the sweat from my face with the two sleeves of my t-shirt and used Margo's desk to pull myself up.</t4956> <t4957>I walked to the other side of the room, crawled through the Hobbit Hole, and moved towards the three flashlights scanning the wall over the rolled-up carpet.</t4957>
<t4958>“Look,” said Ben, using the light to draw a square on the wall.</t4958> <t4959>“Those small holes you mentioned?</t4959><t4960>”</t4960>
<t4961>“Yes?</t4961><t4962>”</t4962>
<t4963>“There should be notes pinned up there.</t4963> <t4964>We think they are postcards or pictures, judging by the gaps between the holes.</t4964> <t4965>Maybe he took them with him,” said Ben.</t4965>
<t4966>“Yes, maybe,” I said.</t4966> <t4967>“I wish we could find the notebook Gus mentioned.</t4967><t4968>”</t4968>
<t4969>“Yes, when you mentioned it, I remembered that notebook,” said Lacey, my flashlight's beam only illuminating her legs.</t4969> <t4970>“There was always one with him.</t4970> <t4971>I never saw him write in it, but I just thought it was some kind of agenda or something.</t4971> <t4972>God, I never asked.</t4972> <t4973>I got mad at Gus, who didn't even have a friend.</t4973> <t4974>But what did I ever ask him?</t4974><t4975>”</t4975>
<t4976>“She wouldn't answer anyway,” I said.</t4976> <t4977>It wasn't honest for Margo to act as if she hadn't been part of her own disappearance.</t4977>
<t4978>We wandered around for another hour, and just when I was certain that this walk was useless, my lantern came across the neighborhood brochures, which had been likened to a house of cards when we first arrived here.</t4978> <t4979>One of the brochures was for Grovepoint Acres.</t4979> <t4980>My breath was taken away as I spread out the other brochures.</t4980> <t4981>I ran to my backpack, which was standing by the door, and returned with a pen and notebook, writing down the names of all the advertised neighborhoods.</t4981> <t4982>I immediately recognized one: Collier Farms...</t4982> <t4983>one of the two neighborhoods on my list that I had not yet visited.</t4983> <t4984>I finished writing down the names of the neighborhoods and put the notebook back in my bag.</t4984> <t4985>You can call me selfish, but if I found it, I wanted to do it alone.</t4985>
<t4986>On Friday, the moment my mom came home from work, I told her that I was going to a concert with Radar and then started driving out to rural Seminole County to see Collier Farms.</t4986> <t4987>It turned out that all the other neighborhoods in the brochures existed—most of them were on the north side of the city, which had been fully settled a long time ago.</t4987>
<t4988>I was able to notice the Collier Farms turnoff because I had become something of an expert at spotting hard-to-see dirt roads.</t4988> <t4989>But Collier Farms was unlike any other neighborhood I had seen, because it was overgrown with wild bushes as if it had been abandoned fifty years ago.</t4989> <t4990>I didn't know if it was older than the other neighborhoods or if it had a swampy ground that caused everything to grow faster, but the entrance road to Collier Farms became impassable right after I turned onto it because a dense thicket of thorny bushes had grown on both sides of the road.</t4990>
<t4991>I got out of the car and started walking.</t4991> <t4992>Overgrown weeds were brushing against my legs, and my sneakers were sinking into the mud with every step.</t4992> <t4993>Somewhere out there, I had no choice but to hope for a piece of land elevated a meter above everything else, with a tent protecting it from the rain.</t4993> <t4994>I was walking slowly because there were more things to see and more places to hide than in other areas, and I also knew that this neighborhood had a direct connection to the shopping mall.</t4994> <t4995>Ground</t4995>
<t4996>It was so dense that I had to walk slowly, checking every place large enough to fit a person on every flat surface.</t4996> <t4997>At the end of the road, I saw a blue and white cardboard box in the mud, and for a second, this box looked exactly like the ones I had seen in the shopping mall.</t4997> <t4998>But, no.</t4998> <t4999>This was a decaying twelve-pack of beer.</t4999> <t5000>I walked back to the minivan with heavy steps and set off towards a farther place to the north called Logan Pines.</t5000>
<t5001>It took me an hour to get there; I was now near the Ocala National Forest and not even within the city limits of Orlando.</t5001> <t5002>I had advanced a few kilometers when Ben called.</t5002>
<t5003>“How are you?</t5003><t5004>”</t5004>
<t5005>"Have you set out towards those paper cities?" he asked.</t5005>
<t5006>“Yes, I have almost reached the last of what I know.</t5006> <t5007>There is still nothing.</t5007><t5008>”</t5008>
<t5009>“Well, listen, brother, Radar's parents suddenly had to leave the city.</t5009><t5010>”</t5010>
<t5011>“Is everything okay?” I asked.</t5011> <t5012>I knew that Radar’s grandparents were quite old and lived in a nursing home in Miami.</t5012>
<t5013>"Yes, take a look: You know this man living in Pittsburgh who has the second largest black Santa Claus collection in the world, right?"</t5013><t5014>"</t5014>
<t5015>“Yes?</t5015><t5016>”</t5016>
<t5017>“He just kicked the bucket.</t5017><t5018>”</t5018>
<t5019>“You are joking.</t5019><t5020>”</t5020>
<t5021>“Brother, I wouldn't joke about the death of black Santa Claus collectors.</t5021> <t5022>The man had an aneurysm, so Radar's people are flying to Pennsylvania to buy his entire collection.</t5022> <t5023>So, we're calling a few people over here.</t5023><t5024>”</t5024>
<t5025>“Who are we?</t5025><t5026>”</t5026>
<t5027>“Me, you, and Radar.</t5027> <t5028>We are the hosts.</t5028><t5029>”</t5029>
<t5030>“I don't know,” I said.</t5030>
<t5031>There was a pause, then Ben used my full name.</t5031> <t5032>“Quentin,” he said, “I know you want to find her.</t5032> <t5033>I know that Margo is the most important thing to you.</t5033> <t5034>And that's okay.</t5034> <t5035>But we are graduating in about a week.</t5035> <t5036>I don't want you to stop searching.</t5036> <t5037>I want you to come to a party with the two best friends you've known your whole life.</t5037> <t5038>I want you to be a little, sweet girl and spend two or three hours drinking sugary wines and then spend another two or three hours throwing up the aforementioned wines through your nose.</t5038> <t5039>After that, you can go back to looking at abandoned subdivisions.</t5039><t5040>”</t5040>
<t5041>It bothered me that Ben only wanted to talk about Margo when it was related to an adventure he enjoyed, and that he thought there was something wrong with me for focusing on Margo instead of my friends, even when Margo was missing and they were not.</t5041> <t5042>But Ben was Ben, as Radar would say.</t5042> <t5043>And anyway, I had nothing left to search for after Logan Pines.</t5043> <t5044>"I have to go to one place, and then I'll come."</t5044><t5045>"</t5045>
<t5046>Since Logan Pines was the last subdivision in Central Florida, or at least the last one I knew of, I had high hopes for this place.</t5046> <t5047>But as I wandered down its only dead-end street with a flashlight, I saw no tents.</t5047> <t5048>There were no campfires.</t5048> <t5049>There were no food wrappers, no signs of human presence.</t5049> <t5050>There was no Margo.</t5050> <t5051>At the end of the road, I found a single concrete foundation dug into the ground.</t5051> <t5052>But nothing had been built on it, just a hole dug into the ground like a dead, gaping mouth, a tangle of bushes, and waist-high weeds growing everywhere.</t5052> <t5053>If Margo had wanted me to see these places, I couldn't understand why.</t5053> <t5054>And if she had gone to subdivisions never to return, she knew of a place that I had not uncovered throughout my entire investigation.</t5054>
<t5055>It took me an hour and a half to get back to Jefferson Park.</t5055> <t5056>I parked the minivan at home, changed my clothes, put on a turtleneck shirt and my only stylish jeans, and walked from Jefferson Road towards Jefferson Courthouse, then turned right onto Jefferson Street.</t5056> <t5057>A few cars had already lined up on both sides of Jefferson Square, which is Radar's street.</t5057> <t5058>It was only eight forty-five.</t5058>
<t5059>I opened the door and was greeted by Radar holding an armful of plaster-made black Santa Clauses.</t5059> <t5060>“I must put away all the nice ones,” he said.</t5060> <t5061>“God forbid, one of them might break.</t5061><t5062>”</t5062>
<t5063>“Do you need help?” I asked.</t5063> <t5064>Radar nodded towards the living room, where there were three groups of unstacked black Santa Claus nesting dolls on the side tables of the sofa.</t5064> <t5065>While stacking them, I couldn't help but notice how beautiful they really were...</t5065> <t5066>They were hand-painted and extraordinarily detailed.</t5066> <t5067>Though I didn't tell Radar this, fearing he might beat me to death with the black Santa Claus lamp in the living room.</t5067>
<t5068>I moved the Matryoshka dolls to the guest room where Radar carefully hid Santa Clauses in the chiffonier.</t5068> <t5069>“When you see them all together, it really makes you question the way we imagine our myths.</t5069><t5070>”</t5070>
<t5071>Radar rolled his eyes.</t5071> <t5072>“Yes, every morning while eating my Lucky Charms cereal with a damn black Santa Claus spoon, I constantly find myself questioning the way I imagine my myths.”</t5072> <t5073>I felt a hand on my shoulder, turning me around.</t5073> <t5074>It was Ben, his feet were shuffling quickly, as if he needed to pee or something.</t5074> <t5075>“We kissed.</t5075> <t5076>I mean, she kissed me.</t5076> <t5077>About ten minutes ago.</t5077> <t5078>In Radar’s parents’ bed.</t5078><t5079>”</t5079>
<t5080>“This is disgusting,” said Radar.</t5080> <t5081>“Don't mess around in my parents' bedroom.</t5081><t5082>”</t5082>
<t5083>"Oh my, I thought you were over all this," I said.</t5083> <t5084>"Because you're a complete pimp or something.</t5084><t5085>"</t5085>
<t5086>"Shut up, brother.</t5086> <t5087>I'm going to lose my mind," he said, looking at me, his eyes almost crossed.</t5087> <t5088>"I don't think I'm very well.</t5088><t5089>"</t5089>
<t5090>“What?</t5090><t5091>”</t5091>
<t5092>“Kissing.</t5092> <t5093>And I mean, he has done the kissing thing much more than I have over the years.</t5093> <t5094>I don't want to be so terrible that he leaves me.</t5094> <t5095>Girls like you,” he said to me, which was only true if you defined girls as “the girls in the band.”</t5095> <t5096>“Brother, I need advice.</t5096><t5097>”</t5097>
<t5098>I intended to talk about all those endless ramblings of Ben's about the various ways he shakes various bodies, but I just said, "As far as I can tell, there are two basic rules: 1.</t5098> <t5099>Don't bite anything without permission and 2.</t5099> <t5100>The human tongue is like wasabi: It's very powerful and should be used sparingly."</t5100>
<t5101>Ben's eyes suddenly widened and brightened with panic.</t5101> <t5102>I flinched and said, "He's standing right behind me, isn't he?"</t5102>
<t5103>"Human language is like wasabi," Lacey mimicked in a thick and silly voice, which I hoped didn't really resemble mine.</t5103> <t5104>I quickly turned around.</t5104> <t5105>"Actually, I think Ben's language is like sunscreen," she said.</t5105> <t5106>"Good for health and should be used generously.</t5106><t5107>"</t5107>
<t5108>“I just threw up into my mouth,” said Radar.</t5108>
<t5109>"Lacey, you just took away my desire to continue," I added.</t5109>
<t5110>"I wish I could stop imagining this," said Radar.</t5110>
<t5111>"The idea itself is so ugly that, in fact, it is illegal to say the words 'I am Starling's tongue' on television," I said.</t5111>
<t5112>“The penalty for violating this law is either ten years in prison or a Ben Starling language bath,” said Radar.</t5112>
<t5113>"Everyone's," I said.</t5113>
<t5114>“The one he chose,” said Radar, smiling.</t5114>
<t5115>“Prison,” we finished together.</t5115>
<t5116>Then Lacey kissed Ben in front of us.</t5116> <t5117>"Oh, God," said Radar, waving his arms in front of his face.</t5117> <t5118>"Oh, God.</t5118> <t5119>I'm blind.</t5119> <t5120>I'm blind.</t5120><t5121>"</t5121>
<t5122>"Please stop," I said.</t5122> <t5123>"You are upsetting the Black Santas.</t5123><t5124>"</t5124>
<t5125>The party was held in the living room on the second floor of Radar's house, all twenty of us were there.</t5125> <t5126>I leaned against a wall, with only centimeters between my head and a portrait of Santa Claus drawn on velvet.</t5126> <t5127>Radar had one of those sectional sofas, and everyone was piled onto it.</t5127> <t5128>There was beer in the cooler next to the TV, but no one was drinking.</t5128> <t5129>Instead, they were telling stories about each other.</t5129> <t5130>I had heard most of them beforeband camp stories, Ben Starling stories, and first kiss storiesbut Lacey hadn't heard any of them, and somehow, they were still fun.</t5130> <t5131>I mostly stayed out of the conversation until Ben said, "Q, how are we going to graduate?"</t5131>
<t5132>I grinned.</t5132> <t5133>"Naked but with our robes," I said.</t5133>
<t5134>“Yes!” Ben took a sip of Dr Pepper.</t5134>
<t5135>"I won't even bring any clothes, so I won't have a chance to chicken out," said Radar.</t5135>
<t5136>“Me too! Q, swear that you won't bring any clothes.</t5136><t5137>”</t5137>
<t5138>I smiled.</t5138> <t5139>“I swear.</t5139><t5140>”</t5140>
<t5141>"I'm in too!" said our friend Frank.</t5141> <t5142>And then more and more people stood behind this idea.</t5142> <t5143>The girls, for some reason, were resisting.</t5143>
<t5144>Radar said to Angela, "Your refusal to do this makes me question the very foundation of our love."</t5144>
<t5145>“You don't understand,” said Lacey.</t5145> <t5146>“It's not because we're scared.</t5146> <t5147>It's just that we've already chosen our dresses.</t5147><t5148>”</t5148>
<t5149>Angela pointed at Lacey.</t5149> <t5150>"Definitely."</t5150> <t5151>"You all better hope the weather won't be windy," she added.</t5151>
<t5152>“I hope it will be windy,” said Ben.</t5152> <t5153>“The largest balloons in the world benefit from fresh air.</t5153><t5154>”</t5154>
<t5155>Lacey, blushing, put a hand to her face.</t5155> <t5156>“You’re a challenging boyfriend,” she said.</t5156> <t5157>“Valuable but challenging.”</t5157> <t5158>We laughed.</t5158>
<t5159>This was my favorite thing about my friends: sitting idly and telling stories.</t5159> <t5160>Window stories and mirror stories.</t5160> <t5161>I only listened...</t5161> <t5162>The stories in my mind were not as fun.</t5162>
<t5163>I couldn't help but think that school and everything else was over.</t5163> <t5164>I just enjoyed standing outside the couches and watching them...</t5164> <t5165>It was a kind of sadness that didn't bother me, and I just listened, allowing all the joy and sorrow of this ending vortex inside me to sharpen each other.</t5165> <t5166>For a long time, it felt like my chest was cracking open, but not exactly in a bad way.</t5166>
<t5167>I left just before midnight.</t5167> <t5168>Some were still there, but it was time for me to go home and I didn't feel like staying.</t5168> <t5169>My mother was dozing on the couch, but she perked up when she saw me.</t5169> <t5170>"Did you have fun?</t5170><t5171>"</t5171>
<t5172>“Yes,” I said.</t5172> <t5173>“It was quite good.</t5173><t5174>”</t5174>
<t5175>“Just like you,” she said, smiling.</t5175> <t5176>This comment seemed funny to me, but I didn't say anything.</t5176> <t5177>She stood up, pulled me towards her, and kissed me on the cheek.</t5177> <t5178>“I really enjoy being your mother,” she said.</t5178>
<t5179>"Thank you," I said.</t5179>
<t5180>I got into bed with Whitman, turned the pages to the section I loved before, the place where all my time was spent hearing the opera and the people.</t5180>
<t5181>After hearing all of that, he writes: "I am exposed... I am being shattered by the bitter and poisonous hail."</t5181> <t5182>This is perfect, I thought: You listen to people to be able to imagine them and all the terrible and wonderful things people do to themselves and to each other</t5182>
<t5183>You hear them, but in the end, listening reveals more about you than the people you are trying to listen to.</t5183>
<t5184>Wandering through the suburbs and trying to listen to him doesn't unravel the mystery of Margo Roth Spiegelman as much as it unravels me.</t5184> <t5185>On the following pages, Whitman starts writing about all the travels he can imagine, hearing and exposing, and lists all the places he can go by idling on the grass.</t5185> <t5186>“My palms cover continents,” he writes.</t5186>
<t5187>When I was a child, I continued to think about maps in the way I sometimes looked at atlases, and even the act of looking itself was in a way like being somewhere else.</t5187> <t5188>This was what I needed to do.</t5188> <t5189>I needed to hear and imagine my way into his map.</t5189>
<t5190>But hadn't I tried to do this?</t5190> <t5191>I looked at the maps on top of my computer.</t5191> <t5192>I had tried to chart her possible journeys, but just as grass meant too much, Margo also meant too much.</t5192> <t5193>It seemed impossible to pinpoint her with maps.</t5193> <t5194>She was very small, while the area covered by the maps was very large.</t5194> <t5195>The maps were much more than a waste of time...</t5195> <t5196>they were physical representations of my absolute inability to develop continent-spanning hands and to possess the kind of mind that imagines properly, the total inefficiency of all this.</t5196>
<t5197>I got out of bed, walked towards the maps, and took them off the wall, pins and tacks flying out of the paper and falling to the floor.</t5197> <t5198>I crumpled the maps into a ball and threw them into the trash can.</t5198> <t5199>As I was returning to bed, like an idiot, I stepped on a tack and, annoyed, tired, drained of my energy and ideas, I had to pick up all the tacks scattered on the carpet so I wouldn't step on them later.</t5199> <t5200>I just wanted to punch the wall, but I had to pick up those damn stupid tacks.</t5200> <t5201>When I finished, I went back to bed and punched the pillow, gritting my teeth.</t5201>
<t5202>I started trying to read Whitman again, but between thinking about poetry and Margo, I've had enough exposure for tonight</t5202>
<t5203>I was feeling it.</t5203> <t5204>That's why I finally put the book aside.</t5204> <t5205>I didn't even have the strength to get up and turn off the light.</t5205> <t5206>I just stared at the wall, my blinks growing longer and longer.</t5206> <t5207>And every time I opened my eyes, I saw where each map used to be...</t5207> <t5208>four holes forming a rectangle, and the pinholes seemed randomly distributed within the rectangle.</t5208> <t5209>I had seen a similar shape before.</t5209> <t5210>In the empty room, on the rolled-up carpet.</t5210>
<t5211>A map with marked points.</t5211>
<t5212>I woke up with daylight just before seven on Saturday morning.</t5212> <t5213>Surprisingly, Radar was online.</t5213>
<t5214>DİRİLİŞÇİQ: I definitely thought you were asleep.</t5214> <t5215>OMNICTIONARIAN96: No, dude.</t5215> <t5216>I've been up since dawn, expanding the page about that Malaysian pop singer.</t5216> <t5217>Angela is still in bed though.</t5217>
<t5218>RESURRECTION ÇİQ: Oh, did it stay there?</t5218>
<t5219>OMNICTIONARIAN96: Yes, but my innocence is still untouched.</t5219> <t5220>Although on graduation night...</t5220> <t5221>I think it might happen.</t5221> <t5222>DİRİLİŞÇİQ: Hey, I thought of something last night.</t5222> <t5223>Those small holes on the wall of the shopping mall...</t5223> <t5224>could they be a map marked with pushpins?</t5224> <t5225>OMNICTIONARIAN96: Like a route.</t5225>
<t5226>DİRİLİŞÇİQ: Absolutely.</t5226>
<t5227>OMNICTIONARIAN96: Do you want to go there?</t5227> <t5228>Actually, I need to wait until Ange wakes up.</t5228>
<t5229>RESURRECTIONIST: Wonderful.</t5229>
<t5230>He called at ten o'clock.</t5230> <t5231>I picked him up with the minivan and then, thinking that a surprise attack would be the only way to wake him up, we went to Ben's house.</t5231> <t5232>But singing You Are My Sunshine outside his window</t5232>
<t5233>it only resulted in him opening the window and spitting at us.</t5233> <t5234>"I won't do anything until noon," he said authoritatively.</t5234>
<t5235>In the end, I was alone in the car with Radar.</t5235> <t5236>Radar talked a bit about Angela, how much he liked her, and how strange it was to fall in love just a few months before going to different universities, but it was hard to listen to him properly.</t5236> <t5237>I wanted that map.</t5237> <t5238>I wanted to see the places he had marked.</t5238> <t5239>I wanted to pin those tacks back on the wall.</t5239>
<t5240>We entered inside by passing through the office, hurriedly passed through the library, paused briefly to examine the holes in the wall of the bedroom, and entered the gift shop.</t5240> <t5241>This place no longer scared me at all.</t5241> <t5242>As soon as we entered each room and confirmed we were alone, I felt as safe as I did at home.</t5242> <t5243>Under a display counter, I found the box of maps and brochures that I had quickly glanced at on the night of the ball.</t5243> <t5244>I took out the box, lifted it, and balanced it on the corners of a broken glass counter.</t5244> <t5245>First, Radar looked through the contents one by one, searching for something related to the map, then I spread them out, hoping to see pinholes.</t5245>
<t5246>We were approaching the bottom of the box when Radar pulled out a black and white brochure titled FIVE THOUSAND AMERICAN CITIES.</t5246> <t5247>Copyrights had belonged to the Esso company since 1972.</t5247> <t5248>As he carefully opened the map, trying to smooth out the wrinkles, I saw a pinhole in the corner.</t5248> <t5249>“Here it is,” I said, my voice rising.</t5249> <t5250>There was a tear around the pinhole, as if it had been ripped off a wall.</t5250> <t5251>It was a yellowed, thin map of the United States, the kind used in classrooms, with possible direction names written in bold letters.</t5251> <t5252>The tears on the map showed me that this wasn’t designed as a clue...</t5252> <t5253>Margo didn’t leave clues that would muddy the waters.</t5253> <t5254>One way or another, we had stumbled upon something she hadn’t planned, and seeing what she hadn’t planned made me think again about how much she had planned.</t5254> <t5255>And maybe, I thought, in this silent darkness, what she was doing here</t5255>
<t5256>It was.</t5256> <t5257>Traveling while idling as he prepared for the real thing, like Whitman did.</t5257>
<t5258>I ran to the office and found a few thumbtacks on a desk close to Margo's before carefully carrying the map opened with Radar back to Margo's room.</t5258> <t5259>While Radar tried to place the thumbtacks in the corners, I lifted the map and stuck it to the wall, but probably three of the four corners were torn when the map was removed from the wall, as were three of the five marked places.</t5259> <t5260>"Higher and to the left," said Radar.</t5260> <t5261>"No, lower.</t5261> <t5262>Yes.</t5262> <t5263>Don't move." Finally, the map was on the wall, and then we started aligning the holes on the map with those on the wall.</t5263> <t5264>We placed all five pins quite easily.</t5264> <t5265>But a few of the pinholes were also torn, so it was impossible to determine their EXACT locations.</t5265> <t5266>And exact location mattered on a map darkened with the names of five thousand places.</t5266> <t5267>The letters were so small and thin that even to guess each location, I had to get on the carpet and bring my eyeball within a few centimeters of the map.</t5267> <t5268>While I threw out city names, Radar took out his handheld computer and looked up these names on Omnictionary.</t5268>
<t5269>There were two intact points: One looked like Los Angeles, but in Southern California, the cities were so closely clustered that the writings overlapped.</t5269> <t5270>The other intact spot was towards Chicago.</t5270> <t5271>There was a torn spot in New York; judging by the position of the hole on the wall, it was one of New York's five boroughs.</t5271>
<t5272>"With the information we have, this makes sense."</t5272><t5273></t5273>
<t5274>“Yes,” I said.</t5274> <t5275>“But my God, where in New York?</t5275> <t5276>That’s the question.</t5276><t5277>”</t5277>
<t5278>“We are missing something,” he said.</t5278> <t5279>“A clue about the location.</t5279> <t5280>What are the other points?</t5280><t5281>”</t5281>
<t5282>"There is one more in the State of New York, but it is not close to the city.</t5282> <t5283>I mean, look, all the towns are tiny.</t5283> <t5284>It could be Poughkeepsie, Woodstock, or Catskill Park.</t5284><t5285>"</t5285>
<t5286>“Woodstock,” said Radar.</t5286> <t5287>“It would be interesting.</t5287> <t5288>Margo is not much of a hippie, but all that free spirit stuff suits her.</t5288><t5289>”</t5289>
<t5290>“I don't know,” I said.</t5290> <t5291>“The last one is either Washington D.</t5291> <t5292>C., or Annapolis or Chesapeake Bay.</t5292> <t5293>It could actually be one of many places.</t5293><t5294>”</t5294>
<t5295>"It would be good if there was only one point on the map," said Radar with a sullen face.</t5295>
<t5296>“But he is probably going from one place to another,” I said.</t5296> <t5297>Slowly progressing on his eternal journey.</t5297>
<t5298>Radar, while I was reading something about New York, the Catskill Mountains, national capital, the festival in Woodstock in 1969, I sat on the carpet for a while.</t5298> <t5299>Nothing seemed to help.</t5299> <t5300>I felt as if we had pulled all the strings but found nothing.</t5300>
<t5301>After dropping off Radar that afternoon, I sat around the house aimlessly, singing My Own Song and reluctantly studying for exams.</t5301> <t5302>On Monday, I had exams in math and Latin; I think they were my two hardest subjects, and it was impossible to completely ignore them.</t5302> <t5303>I studied for most of Saturday night and throughout Sunday morning, but then, just after dinner, a sudden idea about Margo popped into my head, so I stopped working on Ovid translations and logged into the chat program.</t5303> <t5304>I saw that Lacey was online.</t5304> <t5305>I had just recently learned her username from Ben, but I thought we were now friends enough to message her.</t5305>
<t5306>RESURRECTIONIST: Hey, I'm Q.</t5306>
<t5307>KARALARBAĞLAMIŞ: Hello!</t5307>
<t5308>REVIVALIST: Do you know how much Margo plans everything?</t5308>
<t5309>Have you thought about the time I spent?</t5309>
<t5310>KARALARBAĞLAMIŞ: Do you mean like leaving letters in the soup before Mississippi and directing you to the shopping mall?</t5310>
<t5311>DİRİLİŞÇİQ: Yes, these are not things you can think about in ten minutes.</t5311>
<t5312>KARALARBAĞLAMIŞ: Maybe a notebook.</t5312>
<t5313>DİRİLİŞÇİQ: Absolutely.</t5313>
<t5314>KARALARBAĞLAMIŞ: Yes.</t5314> <t5315>Today I was thinking about this because I remembered a time when we were shopping, and she kept putting her notebook into the bags she liked to make sure it would fit.</t5315>
<t5316>DİRİLİŞÇİQ: I wish I had that notebook.</t5316> <t5317>KARALARBAĞLAMIŞ: Yes, probably with you.</t5317> <t5318>DİRİLİŞÇİQ: Yes.</t5318> <t5319>Wasn't it in the closet?</t5319> <t5320>KARALARBAĞLAMIŞ: No, only the textbooks were there, neatly as always.</t5320>
<t5321>I studied in my room and waited for the others to come online.</t5321> <t5322>After a while, Ben came online, and I invited him to the chat room where Lacey and I were.</t5322> <t5323>They did most of the talking; I was still more or less translating until Radar logged in and joined the room.</t5323> <t5324>Then I put down my pen for the night.</t5324>
<t5325>OMNICTIONARIAN96: Today, someone from New York searched for Margo Roth Spiegelman on Omnictionary.</t5325> <t5326>OBİRBÖBREKENFEKSİYONUYDU: Can you tell me where in New York?</t5326>
<t5327>OMNICTIONARIAN96: Unfortunately, no.</t5327> <t5328>KARALARBAĞLAMIŞ: There are still a few posters in the music shops there.</t5328> <t5329>It's most likely someone just trying to learn something about him.</t5329>
<t5330>OMNICTIONARIAN96: Ah, right.</t5330> <t5331>I forgot that.</t5331> <t5332>Terrible.</t5332> <t5333>DİRİLİŞ ÇIQ: Hey, I'm coming and going because I'm using this site where Radar shows how to map out the route between the places Margo marked with pins.</t5333> <t5334>OBİRBÖBREKENFEKSİYONUYDU: Address? DİRİLİŞÇİQ: uzunyoldan.</t5334> <t5335>com</t5335>
<t5336>OMNICTIONARIAN96: I have a new theory.</t5336> <t5337>It will emerge while sitting among the audience at graduation.</t5337> <t5338>OBİRBÖBREKENFEKSİYONUYDU: I have an old theory, somewhere in Orlando, mocking us and making sure it's the center of our universe.</t5338>
<t5339>KARALARBAĞLAMIŞ: Me!</t5339>
<t5340>ITWASAKIDNEYINFECTION: I'm sorry but I'm definitely right.</t5340>
<t5341>While I was trying to map out Ben's route, they continued talking about their own Margo like that.</t5341> <t5342>If he hadn't designated the map as a clue and the torn holes showed me he hadn't, I thought we had all the clues he designed for us and even more.</t5342> <t5343>Then I definitely had what I needed.</t5343> <t5344>But I still felt very far away from her.</t5344>
<t5345>19.</t5345>
<t5346>On Monday morning, after three long and lonely hours spent on eight hundred words of Ovid, feeling as if my brain was about to ooze out of my ears, I wandered the corridors.</t5346> <t5347>But it had gone well.</t5347> <t5348>We had an hour and a half for lunch and for our minds to solidify again before the second exam of the day.</t5348> <t5349>Radar was waiting for me at my locker.</t5349>
<t5350>“I just bombarded myself with Spanish.</t5350><t5351>”</t5351>
<t5352>“I'm sure it went well.”</t5352> <t5353>He was going to Dartmouth with an enormous scholarship.</t5353> <t5354>He was very intelligent.</t5354>
<t5355>“Dude, I don't know.</t5355> <t5356>I kept falling asleep during the oral part.</t5356> <t5357>But look, I stayed up almost all night to set up this program.</t5357> <t5358>It's an amazing thing.</t5358> <t5359>What it does is this: It allows you to enter a category—it could be a geographic area or a species in the animal kingdom or something—and then you can read the first sentences of a hundred Omnictionary articles related to the category you're looking for on a single page.</t5359> <t5360>So, like, let's say you're trying to find a specific type of rabbit but you can't remember its name.</t5360> <t5361>In about three minutes or so, you can read the entries of all twenty-one types of rabbits on the same page.</t5361><t5362>”</t5362>
<t5363>“Did you do this the night before the finals?” I asked.</t5363>
<t5364>“Yes, yes I know.</t5364> <t5365>Anyway, I will send it to you by email.</t5365> <t5366>It's a very nerdy thing.</t5366><t5367>”</t5367>
<t5368>At that moment, Ben appeared.</t5368> <t5369>‘I swear, Q, Lacey and I were playing on that site and hanging out on the chat program until two in the morning, that</t5369>
<t5370>On the uzunyoldan site? When I identified every possible trip Margo could have taken between these five points with Orlando, I realized that I had been wrong all this time.</t5370> <t5371>She is not in Orlando.</t5371> <t5372>Radar is right.</t5372> <t5373>She will come back here for graduation day.</t5373><t5374>”</t5374>
<t5375>“Why?</t5375><t5376>”</t5376>
<t5377>“The timing is perfect.</t5377> <t5378>Driving from Orlando to New York, to the mountains, to Chicago, to Los Angeles, and back to Orlando is exactly a twenty-three-day journey.</t5378> <t5379>This is really a lame joke but a Margo joke.</t5379> <t5380>Surround yourself with an air of mystery so everyone pays attention.</t5380> <t5381>Then, just as all the attention starts to fade, show up at graduation.</t5381><t5382>”</t5382>
<t5383>“No,” I said.</t5383> <t5384>“It's not possible.”</t5384> <t5385>By now, I had known Margo better than this.</t5385> <t5386>She wanted attention.</t5386> <t5387>I believed that.</t5387> <t5388>But Margo wouldn't play with life just for fun.</t5388> <t5389>She didn't take pleasure in sheer trickery.</t5389>
<t5390>“I’m telling you, my brother.</t5390> <t5391>Call her at graduation.</t5391> <t5392>She will be there.”</t5392> <t5393>I just nodded.</t5393> <t5394>Since everyone had the same lunch break, the cafeteria was beyond packed, so as seniors, we used our privilege and drove to Wendy’s.</t5394> <t5395>I tried to focus on my upcoming math exam, but I started to feel like there were more threads in the story.</t5395> <t5396>If Ben was right about the twenty-three-day trip, this was really interesting.</t5396> <t5397>Maybe this was what he had planned in his black notebook, a long and lonely trip.</t5397> <t5398>It didn’t explain everything, but it fit Margo as a planner.</t5398> <t5399>Of course, this didn’t bring me any closer to her.</t5399> <t5400>It’s hard to pinpoint a spot on a torn map; moreover, if this spot is also moving, it becomes even harder to pinpoint.</t5400>
<t5401>After a long exam day, returning to the peaceful incomprehensibility of My Own Song was almost comforting.</t5401> <t5402>I had reached a strange part of the poem...</t5402> <t5403>After spending so much time hearing, listening to, and wandering among people, Whitman hearing and</t5403>
<t5404>stops visiting and starts becoming other people.</t5404> <t5405>As if he were living inside them.</t5405> <t5406>He tells the story of a captain who saved everyone on his ship except himself.</t5406> <t5407>The poet says he can tell the story because he is the captain.</t5407> <t5408>“I am that man...</t5408> <t5409>I suffered...</t5409> <t5410>I was there,” he writes.</t5410> <t5411>A few lines later, it becomes even clearer that Whitman no longer needs to listen to become others: “I do not ask the wounded person how he feels...</t5411> <t5412>I myself become the wounded person.</t5412><t5413>”</t5413>
<t5414>I put the book aside and turn sideways to look outside through the window that has always been between us.</t5414> <t5415>It is not enough to just see or hear her.</t5415> <t5416>To find Margo Roth Spiegelman, you must become Margo Roth Spiegelman.</t5416>
<t5417>And I had done many of the things he might have done: I had arranged an impossible ballroom couple.</t5417> <t5418>I had silenced the dogs of social class warfare.</t5418> <t5419>I had managed to feel comfortable in the haunted house infested with mice, where my thinking action was at its best.</t5419> <t5420>I had seen.</t5420> <t5421>I had listened.</t5421> <t5422>But I had not yet become that wounded person.</t5422>
<t5423>The next day, I barely passed my physics and politics exams, and then I stayed up until two in the morning to finish my final assignment on Moby Dick for literature.</t5423> <t5424>I decided that Ahab was a hero.</t5424> <t5425>I had no particular reason for this decision—especially considering I hadn't read the book—but I made the decision and reacted accordingly.</t5425>
<t5426>The shortened exam week meant that Wednesday was our last day of school.</t5426> <t5427>And all day, it was hard not to think about the finality of it all: in front of the band room, under the shade of that oak tree that had sheltered generations of band geeks, my last stand in a circle.</t5427> <t5428>My last pizza with Ben in the cafeteria.</t5428> <t5429>My last scribbled essay in a blue notebook, sitting in this school with my clenched hand.</t5429> <t5430>My last glance at the clock.</t5430> <t5431>Chuck Parson’s partially scornful smile as he patrolled the hallways for the last time.</t5431>
<t5432>my view.</t5432> <t5433>My God.</t5433> <t5434>I was longing for Chuck Parson.</t5434> <t5435>Something sickly was happening inside me.</t5435>
<t5436>It must have been the same for Margo.</t5436> <t5437>According to all the planning she did, she must have known she was going to leave, and even she wasn't completely devoid of emotions.</t5437> <t5438>She had had good days here.</t5438> <t5439>On one's last day, it becomes very difficult to remember the bad days because, one way or another, she too had built a life here just like I did.</t5439> <t5440>The city was made of paper, but the memories were not.</t5440> <t5441>Everything I did here, all that love, compassion, tenderness, violence, and hatred, continued to accumulate inside me.</t5441> <t5442>These whitewashed concrete walls.</t5442> <t5443>My white walls.</t5443> <t5444>Margo's white walls.</t5444> <t5445>We had been trapped among them for so long that we were stuck in their stomachs like Jonah.</t5445>
<t5446>Throughout the day, I found myself thinking that perhaps this was the reason Margo planned everything so meticulously and precisely: Even if you wanted to leave, it was so difficult.</t5446> <t5447>You had to prepare, and maybe sitting in the shopping mall scribbling my plans was both a mental and emotional exercise...</t5447> <t5448>A way to imagine Margo living out her destiny.</t5448>
<t5449>Both Ben and Radar had a long band rehearsal to ensure they could play the Pomp and Circumstance march properly at graduation.</t5449> <t5450>Lacey offered to drive me, but I decided to clean out my locker because I really didn't want to have to come back here later and feel my lungs choking with this perverse longing.</t5450>
<t5451>My locker was a pure junk nest... partly a trash can, partly a book depot.</t5451> <t5452>I remembered that when Lacey opened it, Margo's textbooks were neatly arranged in her locker, as if she intended to come to school the next day.</t5452> <t5453>I pulled a trash can next to the row of lockers and opened mine, starting to take out the contents with a photo of Radar, Ben, and me goofing around.</t5453> <t5454>I put the photo in my backpack, then the filth that had accumulated over a year, notebook</t5454>
<t5455>Gums wrapped in pieces of paper, pens with no ink, greasy napkins—I began the disgusting process of scraping them into the trash.</t5455> <t5456>From the beginning, I kept thinking: I will never do this again, I will never be here again, this will never be my locker again, I will never write notes in math with Radar again, I will never see Margo from the other side of the hallway again.</t5456> <t5457>This was the first time in my life that many things would never happen again.</t5457>
<t5458>And in the end, it was too much.</t5458> <t5459>I couldn't overcome this feeling and it became unbearable.</t5459> <t5460>I reached into the depths, the insides of my closet.</t5460> <t5461>I threw everything—photos, notes, books—into the trash can.</t5461> <t5462>I left the closet open and walked away.</t5462> <t5463>As I passed by the band room, I could hear the muffled sound of "Pomp and Circumstance" from behind the walls.</t5463> <t5464>It was hot outside but not as much as usual.</t5464> <t5465>It was bearable.</t5465> <t5466>Most of the way home has a sidewalk, I thought.</t5466> <t5467>So I kept walking.</t5467>
<t5468>No matter how paralyzing and upsetting the never-agains were, the feeling given by the last exit was perfect.</t5468> <t5469>It was pure.</t5469> <t5470>It was the most distilled form of salvation.</t5470> <t5471>Everything that mattered, except that lousy photo, was in the trash, but I felt great.</t5471> <t5472>I started running with the desire to put even more distance between me and the school.</t5472>
<t5473>Leaving is very hard...</t5473> <t5474>until you leave.</t5474> <t5475>After that, it's the easiest damn thing in the world.</t5475>
<t5476>While running, for the first time, I felt like I was becoming Margo.</t5476> <t5477>I knew: She is not in Orlando.</t5477> <t5478>She is not in Florida.</t5478> <t5479>Once you leave, leaving feels really good.</t5479> <t5480>If I were in a car instead of on foot, I could have kept going too.</t5480> <t5481>Margo was gone and she wasn't coming back for graduation or anything else.</t5481> <t5482>I was sure of that now.</t5482>
<t5483>I am leaving, and leaving is so invigorating that I know I can never return.</t5483> <t5484>But what then?</t5484> <t5485>Will I just continue to leave places, slowly progressing on an eternal journey?</t5485>
<t5486>Ben and Radar drove past me in a car five hundred meters from Jefferson Park, and despite there being traffic everywhere, Ben stopped the SESIB with a high-pitched sound right at Lakemont. I ran to the car and got in.</t5486> <t5487>They wanted to play Resurrection at my house, but I had to say no to them because I was closer than I had ever been before.</t5487>
<t5488>20</t5488>
<t5489>All Wednesday night and Thursday, I tried to use my new understanding to find a connection between the clues I had, the travel guides, and the map; or between Whitman and the map, to understand his journey.</t5489> <t5490>But more and more, I was thinking, perhaps he had taken pleasure in abandoning the trail so much that it wouldn't form a proper trace from breadcrumbs.</t5490> <t5491>And if that was the case, the map he never planned for us to see might be our best chance to find him.</t5491> <t5492>But none of the locations on the map were clear enough.</t5492> <t5493>Even the point of interest, Catskill Park, which caught my attention because it was the only place not in or near a big city, was too large and crowded to find a single person.</t5493> <t5494>My Song referred to places in New York, but there were too many places to track them all.</t5494> <t5495>If the point seemed to be moving from one big city to another, how would you pinpoint that location on the map?</t5495>
<t5496>When my mom and dad entered my room on Friday, I had already gotten up and was flipping through the pages of travel guides.</t5496> <t5497>They rarely entered my room at the same time, and before I remembered that it was my graduation day, I felt a wave of nausea...</t5497> <t5498>Maybe they had bad news about Margo.</t5498>
<t5499>“Are you ready, my friend?</t5499><t5500>”</t5500>
<t5501>“Yes, I mean, it's not a big deal but it will be fun.</t5501><t5502>”</t5502>
<t5503>"You only graduate from high school once," said my mom.</t5503>
<t5504>“Yes,” I said.</t5504> <t5505>They sat on the bed across from me.</t5505> <t5506>I noticed them glancing at each other and giggling.</t5506> <t5507>“What?” I asked.</t5507>
<t5508>“Well, we want to give you your graduation gift,” said my mom.</t5508> <t5509>“We are really proud of you, Quentin.</t5509> <t5510>You are the greatest achievement of our lives, and this is such a big day for you, and we...</t5510> <t5511>You are just a wonderful young man.</t5511><t5512>”</t5512>
<t5513>I smiled and looked down.</t5513> <t5514>Then my father took out a very small gift wrapped in blue paper.</t5514>
<t5515>"No," I said, grabbing it from his hand.</t5515>
<t5516>“Go on, open it.</t5516><t5517>”</t5517>
<t5518>"It can't be," I said, looking at the gift.</t5518> <t5519>It was the size of a key.</t5519> <t5520>It was the weight of a key.</t5520> <t5521>When I shook the box, it rattled like a key.</t5521>
<t5522>"Just eat, sweetie," insisted my mom.</t5522>
<t5523>I tore the wrapping paper.</t5523> <t5524>A KEY! I examined it closely.</t5524> <t5525>A Ford key!</t5525> <t5526>Neither of our cars was a Ford.</t5526> <t5527>“Did you buy me a car?!”</t5527><t5528>”</t5528>
<t5529>“We bought it,” said my dad.</t5529> <t5530>“It’s not new...</t5530> <t5531>but it’s only two years old and has only twenty thousand kilometers.”</t5531> <t5532>I jumped and hugged both of them.</t5532>
<t5533>“Mine?</t5533><t5534>”</t5534>
<t5535>“Yes!” my mom almost shouted.</t5535> <t5536>I had a car!</t5536> <t5537>A car! Mine!</t5537>
<t5538>I freed myself from them, running towards the living room, shouting, "thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you" and quickly opened the street door, wearing only an old t-shirt and boxers.</t5538> <t5539>There, parked on the driveway with a huge blue bow on it, was a Ford minivan.</t5539>
<t5540>They had given me a minivan.</t5540> <t5541>They could have chosen any car, and they chose a minivan.</t5541> <t5542>A minivan.</t5542> <t5543>Oh, God of Vehicle Justice, why are you mocking me?</t5543> <t5544>Minivan, the bane of my existence!</t5544>
<t5545>You are my final curse!</t5545> <t5546>You miserable monster of high ceilings and low horsepower!</t5546>
<t5547>When I turned my back, I put on a brave face.</t5547> <t5548>"Thank you thank you thank you!" I said, but since it was completely fake, my voice definitely didn't sound as enthusiastic anymore.</t5548>
<t5549>“Well, we knew how much you loved driving mine,” said my mom.</t5549> <t5550>Both her and my dad's eyes were shining...</t5550> <t5551>clearly convinced they had provided me with the car of my dreams.</t5551> <t5552>“Great for driving around with your friends,” added my dad.</t5552> <t5553>Considering these people specialized in analyzing and understanding the human soul...</t5553>
<t5554>"Look," said my father, "if we want to get good seats, we should leave soon."</t5554><t5555></t5555>
<t5556>I had neither taken a shower nor gotten dressed.</t5556> <t5557>Well, technically I wouldn't be dressed anyway, but still...</t5557> <t5558>“I don't have to be there until about the time of the fire,” I said.</t5558> <t5559>“I need to get ready and all.</t5559><t5560>”</t5560>
<t5561>My father frowned.</t5561> <t5562>"Well, I really want to have a good perspective, so I can take photos...</t5562><t5563>"</t5563>
<t5564>I interrupted him.</t5564> <t5565>“I can take MY OWN CAR,” I said.</t5565> <t5566>“I can come with MY OWN CAR, BY MYSELF.”</t5566> <t5567>I smiled broadly.</t5567>
<t5568>“I know!” my mother said excitedly.</t5568> <t5569>So what...</t5569> <t5570>a car is a car after all.</t5570> <t5571>Driving my own minivan was definitely a step forward compared to driving someone else's.</t5571>
<t5572>Then I went back to my computer and informed Radar and Lacey (Ben wasn't online) about the minivan.</t5572>
<t5573>OMNICTIONARIAN96: Actually, this is really good news.</t5573> <t5574>Can I stop by and put a cooler in your trunk?</t5574> <t5575>I have to take my mom and dad to the graduation, and I don't want them to see it.</t5575>
<t5576>DİRİLİŞÇİQ: Of course, I didn't lock it.</t5576> <t5577>What is the cooler for?</t5577> <t5578>OMNICTIONARIAN96: Well, since no one drank them, I have 212 beers left from my party and we're going to take them to Lacey's for tonight's party.</t5578>
<t5579>RESURRECTIONIST: 212 beers?</t5579>
<t5580>OMNICTIONARIAN96: A large cooler.</t5580>
<t5581>Then Ben came online; he was already showered, naked, and just needed to put on the cap and gown, SHOUTING.</t5581> <t5582>We were all talking about our naked graduation.</t5582> <t5583>After everyone went offline to get ready, I stood up straight in the shower so the water would hit me directly in the face and started thinking as the water hit me.</t5583> <t5584>New York or California?</t5584> <t5585>Chicago or Washington?</t5585> <t5586>Now I can go too, I thought.</t5586> <t5587>Just like he had, I also had a car.</t5587> <t5588>I could go to the five locations on the map, and even if I didn't find her, it would be more fun than another scorching summer in Orlando.</t5588> <t5589>But no.</t5589> <t5590>It's like sneaking into SeaWorld.</t5590> <t5591>It requires a flawless plan, the plan is executed masterfully, and then...</t5591> <t5592>it leads nowhere.</t5592> <t5593>Then, it's just like SeaWorld, except darker.</t5593> <t5594>Margo had told me that the fun of it was not in the doing, but in the planning.</t5594>
<t5595>And this is what I was thinking while standing under the showerhead: planning.</t5595> <t5596>Margo is sitting in the mall with her notebook, planning something.</t5596> <t5597>Maybe she's using the map to imagine routes and plan a journey.</t5597> <t5598>She's reading Whitman and underlining the sentence "I am slowly advancing on an eternal journey" because it's the kind of thing she would enjoy imagining herself doing, the kind of thing she would enjoy planning.</t5598>
<t5599>But is it really the kind of thing she would enjoy doing?</t5599> <t5600>No.</t5600> <t5601>Because Margo knows the secret of leaving a place, a secret I have only now learned: Leaving is only about an important place, a moment</t5601>
<t5602>When a place with a soul is abandoned, it feels good and pure.</t5602> <t5603>Like uprooting life from its roots.</t5603> <t5604>But this is not possible until life has taken root.</t5604>
<t5605>So when she left, she left never to return.</t5605> <t5606>But it was impossible for me to believe that she had embarked on an eternal journey.</t5606> <t5607>I was sure she had left to go somewhere...</t5607> <t5608>somewhere she could stay long enough for it to mean something, for the next departure to feel as good as the last one.</t5608> <t5609>Somewhere far from here, in a corner of the world where no one knows what the name "Margo Roth Spiegelman" means, Margo is sitting, scribbling something in her black notebook.</t5609>
<t5610>The water started to cool down.</t5610> <t5611>I hadn't even touched the bar of soap, but I got out; I wrapped a towel around my waist and sat down at the computer.</t5611>
<t5612>I searched for and found Radar's email about the Omnictionary program and downloaded the software.</t5612> <t5613>It was indeed quite good.</t5613> <t5614>First, I entered an area code in downtown Chicago, clicked the "location" button, and requested a radius of thirty kilometers.</t5614> <t5615>It provided a hundred results from Navy Pier to Deerfield.</t5615> <t5616>The first sentence of each entry appeared on my screen, and I read them all in about five minutes.</t5616> <t5617>Nothing caught my eye.</t5617> <t5618>Then I tried an area code near Catskill Park in New York.</t5618> <t5619>This time there were fewer results, eighty-two, and they were organized by the date the Omnictionary pages were created.</t5619> <t5620>I started reading.</t5620>
<t5621>Woodstock, New York, located in Ulster County, is a city known for the 1969 Woodstock concert, a three-day festival where many performers, from Jimi Hendrix to Janis Joplin, took the stage, although it was actually held in a nearby town [see.</t5621> <t5622>Woodstock Concert].</t5622>
<t5623>Katrine Lake, located in Ulster County, New York, is a small lake frequently visited by Henry David Thoreau.</t5623>
<t5624>Catskill Park encompasses a 700,000-acre area in the Catskill Mountains, jointly held by local governments and the state, including a five percent share held by New York City, which collects most of its water from reservoirs partially located within the park.</t5624>
<t5625>Roscoe, New York, according to the latest census, is a hamlet in the State of New York that houses 261 households.</t5625>
<t5626>Agloe, New York, is an imaginary village established by the Esso company in the early 1930s and inserted into tourist maps as a copyright trap or a paper town.</t5626>
<t5627>I clicked on the link and this link took me to the full article that continued as follows:</t5627>
<t5628>Roscoe, located at the intersection of two dirt roads just north of New York, gets its name from the cartographer Otto G., who made an anagram from the first letters of their names.</t5628> <t5629>It is derived from Lindberg and Ernest Alpers.</t5629> <t5630>Copyright traps have been a part of mapmaking for centuries.</t5630> <t5631>Cartographers create imaginary boundary markers, streets, and areas and place them on their maps in a way that is difficult to understand.</t5631> <t5632>If the imaginary input appears on another cartographer's map, it reveals that the map has been copied and published.</t5632> <t5633>Copyright traps are sometimes called key traps, paper streets, and paper towns [see also</t5633> <t5634>imaginary inputs].</t5634> <t5635>There are a few cartography institutions that exist</t5635>
<t5636>Even if accepted, copyright traps have remained a common feature even in modern maps.</t5636>
<t5637>In the 1940s, Agloe, New York started appearing on maps made by other companies.</t5637> <t5638>Esso suspected copyright infringement and filed numerous lawsuits, but in fact, an unknown resident had established the Agloe Market at the intersection shown on the Esso map.</t5638>
<t5639>The still existing [citation needed] building is the only structure in Agloe, which continues to be recorded as having a population of zero and continues to appear on many maps.</t5639>
<t5640>This Omnictionary entry contained subpages where all the edits made on the page and all the discussions about the entry by Omnictionary members could be seen.</t5640> <t5641>The Agloe page had not been edited by anyone for almost a year, but there was a new comment written by an anonymous user on the discussion page:</t5641>
<t5642>Whoever arranged this, it is to his knowledge...</t5642> <t5643>The population of Agloe will actually be one until noon on May 29.</t5643>
<t5644>I immediately recognized the way of using capital letters.</t5644><t5645>The rules for using capital letters are not fair at all for words in the middle of a sentence.</t5645><t5646>My throat tightened, but I forced myself to calm down.</t5646><t5647>The comment had been left fifteen days ago.</t5647><t5648>It had been waiting for me there all this time.</t5648><t5649>I looked at the computer's clock.</t5649><t5650>Right now, I had less than twenty-four hours.</t5650>
<t5651>For the first time in weeks, Margo looked completely and undeniably alive to me.</t5651> <t5652>She was alive.</t5652> <t5653>At least for one more day, she was alive.</t5653> <t5654>To stop myself from wondering whether she was alive or not, for so long she had been</t5654>
<t5655>I was so focused on the place that I had no idea how scared I had been until now, but oh, my God...</t5655> <t5656>He was alive.</t5656>
<t5657>I jumped, didn't care that the towel fell, and called Radar.</t5657> <t5658>While pulling on my boxers and shorts, I placed the phone in the crook of my neck.</t5658> <t5659>“I know what paper towns mean!</t5659> <t5660>Is the handheld computer next to you?</t5660><t5661>”</t5661>
<t5662>“Yes.</t5662> <t5663>You really should be here, my friend.</t5663> <t5664>They are about to line us up.</t5664><t5665>”</t5665>
<t5666>I heard Ben shouting at the phone: "Tell her, she better be naked!</t5666><t5667>"</t5667>
<t5668>“Radar,” I said, trying to convey the importance of the situation.</t5668> <t5669>“Look at the Agloe, New York page.</t5669> <t5670>Did you find it?</t5670><t5671>”</t5671>
<t5672>“Yes.</t5672> <t5673>I'm reading.</t5673> <t5674>Wait.</t5674> <t5675>Wow.</t5675> <t5676>Wow.</t5676> <t5677>Could this be the Catskills point on the map?</t5677><t5678>”</t5678>
<t5679>“Yes, I guess so.</t5679> <t5680>Quite close.</t5680> <t5681>Go to the discussion page.</t5681><t5682>”</t5682>
<t5683>ii »</t5683>
<t5684>“Radar?</t5684><t5685>”</t5685>
<t5686>“Aman Tannm.</t5686><t5687>”</t5687>
<t5688>“I know, I know!” I shouted.</t5688> <t5689>I didn't hear his response because I was pulling my T-shirt over my head, but when the phone was back to my ear, I could hear Radar talking to Ben.</t5689> <t5690>I hung up the phone.</t5690>
<t5691>I searched the internet for directions from Orlando to Agloe, but the map system was unaware of Agloe, so I looked up Roscoe instead.</t5691> <t5692>The computer said it would be a nineteen-hour and four-minute journey at an average speed of one hundred kilometers per hour.</t5692> <t5693>It was two fifteen.</t5693> <t5694>I had twenty-one hours and forty-five minutes to get there.</t5694> <t5695>I printed out the directions, grabbed the keys to the car, and locked the front door behind me.</t5695>
<t5696>“Nineteen hours and four minutes away,” I said to the cell phone.</t5696> <t5697>Radar's cell phone, but Ben had answered it.</t5697>
<t5698>“So, what are you going to do?” he asked.</t5698> <t5699>“Are you flying there?” “No, I don't have that much money, anyway, it's about eight hours away from New York.</t5699> <t5700>That's why I'm driving.</t5700><t5701>”</t5701>
<t5702>Suddenly, Radar took the phone back.</t5702> <t5703>“How long does the journey take?” “Nineteen hours and four minutes.”</t5703><t5704>”</t5704>
<t5705>“According to whom?</t5705><t5706>”</t5706>
<t5707>“Google Maps.</t5707><t5708>”</t5708>
<t5709>“Damn it,” said Radar.</t5709> <t5710>“None of those map programs account for traffic.</t5710> <t5711>I’ll call you back.</t5711> <t5712>And hurry up.</t5712> <t5713>We should be getting in line right about now.</t5713><t5714>”</t5714>
<t5715>“I am not coming.</t5715> <t5716>I can't risk the time,” I said, but I was talking to the air.</t5716> <t5717>A minute later, Radar called back.</t5717> <t5718>“If you average a hundred kilometers per hour, don't stop, and account for average traffic, it will take you twenty-three hours and nine minutes.</t5718> <t5719>Which means you'll be there after one in the afternoon, so you'd better create some time.</t5719><t5720>”</t5720>
<t5721>“What? But...</t5721><t5722>”</t5722>
<t5723>Radar intervened.</t5723> <t5724>“I don't want to criticize, but maybe in this case, the chronically late person should always listen to the punctual one. No matter what, you should at least come here for a second, otherwise, when your name is called and you don't show up, your mom and dad will go crazy. And it's not because it's a very important factor or anything, but I just thought I'd mention it...</t5724> <t5725>all our beer is with you.</t5725><t5726>”</t5726>
<t5727>“Clearly, I don't have time,” I replied.</t5727>
<t5728>I leaned towards the phone.</t5728> <t5729>“Don't be an ass.</t5729> <t5730>It will cost you five minutes.”</t5730> <t5731>‘Okay, fine.”</t5731> <t5732>I turned right at the red light and floored the minivan...</t5732> <t5733>it accelerated better than my mom's but just barely.</t5733> <t5734>I managed to enter the gym's parking lot within three minutes.</t5734>
<t5735>I wouldn't exactly say I parked the minivan; I stopped in the middle of the parking area and jumped out of the car.</t5735> <t5736>As I was running quickly towards the gym, I saw three people in robes running towards me.</t5736> <t5737>I could see Radar's skinny, black legs under his flying robe, and next to him, Ben was wearing sneakers without socks.</t5737> <t5738>Lacey was right behind them.</t5738>
<t5739>"You grab the beers," I said as I ran past them.</t5739> <t5740>"I need to talk to our guys.</t5740><t5741>"</t5741>
<t5742>The families of the graduates were scattered in the stands, before locating my mom and dad, I ran back and forth a few times on the basketball court.</t5742> <t5743>They were waving at me.</t5743> <t5744>Because I climbed the stairs two at a time, I was a bit out of breath when I knelt down and spoke to them: “Okay, I won’t go up [breath] because I think [breath] I found Margo and [breath] I just have to go, my cell phone is with me [breath] please don’t be mad at me and thanks again for the car.</t5744><t5745>”</t5745>
<t5746>My mother wrapped her arm around my waist and said, "What? Quentin, what are you talking about?</t5746> <t5747>Slow down," she said.</t5747>
<t5748>“I am going to Agloe, New York, and I must go immediately.</t5748> <t5749>That's the whole story.</t5749> <t5750>Okay, I must go.</t5750> <t5751>I have no time.</t5751> <t5752>My cell phone is with me.</t5752> <t5753>Okay, I love you all,” I said.</t5753>
<t5754>I had to pull myself away from my mother's gentle grasp.</t5754> <t5755>Before they could say anything, I jumped down the stairs and ran quickly to the minivan.</t5755> <t5756>I had gotten in, my hand was on the gear, and as I looked to the side and saw Ben sitting in the passenger seat, I was starting to move the car.</t5756>
<t5757>"Grab the beer and get out of the car!" I shouted.</t5757>
<t5758>“We are coming with you,” he said.</t5758> <t5759>“If you try to drive for that long, you will fall asleep anyway.</t5759><t5760>”</t5760>
<t5761>I turned around, both Lacey and Radar were holding their cell phones to their ears.</t5761> <t5762>“I have to tell my mom and dad,” Lacey explained, tapping lightly on the phone.</t5762> <t5763>“Come on, Q.</t5763> <t5764>Walk walk walk.</t5764><t5765>”</t5765>
<t5766>THIRD PART</t5766>
<t5767>Shell</t5767>
<t5768>First Hour</t5768>
<t5769>To everyone's parents, 1.</t5769> <t5770>We are all going to miss graduation and 2.</t5770> <t5771>We are driving to New York, 3.</t5771> <t5772>To see a village that may or may not technically exist and 4. according to Randomly capitalized Evidence 5.</t5772> <t5773>We hope to catch the Omnictionary user who is Margo Roth Spiegelman, takes a long time to explain.</t5773>
<t5774>The last person to escape from the radar phone, and when he finally escaped, he said: "I want to make an announcement.</t5774> <t5775>My parents were angry that I missed the graduation.</t5775> <t5776>My girlfriend was also angry because we were planning to do something very special in about eight hours.</t5776> <t5777>I don't want to go into details, but it better be a really fun trip.</t5777><t5778>"</t5778>
<t5779>“Your ability to maintain your innocence is an inspiration to all of us,” says Ben, who is sitting next to me.</t5779>
<t5780>I take a glance at Radar through the rearview mirror.</t5780> <t5781>“HAHAAA TRIP!” I say.</t5781> <t5782>Despite everything, a smile spreads across his face.</t5782> <t5783>The joy of leaving.</t5783>
<t5784>We are now on I4 and the traffic is quite light, which is truly a miracle.</t5784> <t5785>I am driving in the far left lane at fourteen kilometers per hour over the ninety kilometers per hour speed limit because I once heard that the police don't pull over cars that are only fifteen kilometers per hour over the speed limit.</t5785>
<t5786>We are all quickly getting used to our roles.</t5786>
<t5787>Lacey in the back seat is the supplier.</t5787> <t5788>She is loudly listing everything we currently have for the trip: the half Snickers that Ben was eating when I called Margo; the 212 beers in the trunk; the directions I printed from the printer; and the following items in Lacey's handbag: eight herbal gums, a pencil, a few napkins, three tampons, a pair of sunglasses, ChapStick lip balm, her house keys, a Young Men's Christian Association membership card, a library card, a few receipts, thirty-five dollars, and a BP card.</t5788>
<t5789>Arkadan Lacey, "Very exciting!</t5789> <t5790>We are like sappers with missing equipment!</t5790> <t5791>I wish we had more money though," he says.</t5791>
<t5792>“At least we have a BP card,” I say.</t5792> <t5793>“We can get gas and food.</t5793><t5794>”</t5794>
<t5795>I lift my head and look in the rearview mirror and see Radar, looking into Lacey's bag while wearing a graduation gown.</t5795> <t5796>The collar of the graduation gown is a bit low-cut, so I can see some of his curly chest hair.</t5796> <t5797>"Are there any boxers in there?" he asks.</t5797>
<t5798>"Indeed, it would be good if we stopped at Gap," Ben adds.</t5798>
<t5799>Radar, starting the task on his handheld computer's calculator, Research and Calculations.</t5799> <t5800>Alone with the directions on the seat behind me and the minivan's manual open beside him.</t5800> <t5801>He's calculating how fast we need to go to get there by noon, how many times we need to stop for gas, the BP stations along the way, how long each break will take, and how much time we'll lose slowing down when we exit the main road.</t5801>
<t5802>“We need to stop for gas four times.</t5802> <t5803>The breaks have to be very, very short.</t5803> <t5804>Off the highway, no more than six minutes.</t5804> <t5805>Three long roadworks, plus traffic in Jacksonville, Washington D.</t5805> <t5806>C., and Philadelphia, but passing through Washington around three in the morning will help.</t5806> <t5807>According to my calculations,</t5807>
<t5808>Our average constant speed should be around one hundred fifteen kilometers.</t5808> <t5809>How fast are you going?</t5809><t5810>”</t5810>
<t5811>"One hundred and four," I say.</t5811> <t5812>"The speed limit is ninety.</t5812><t5813>"</t5813>
<t5814>"Go at one hundred fifteen," he says.</t5814>
<t5815>“I can't go, it's dangerous and I'll get punished.</t5815><t5816>”</t5816>
<t5817>“Drive at one hundred fifteen,” he says again.</t5817> <t5818>I press my foot hard on the gas pedal.</t5818> <t5819>The problem is partly my hesitation to drive at one hundred fifteen, and partly the minivan's hesitation to drive at one hundred fifteen.</t5819> <t5820>The minivan starts to shake as if it’s going to fall apart.</t5820> <t5821>Even though I’m still not the fastest car on the road, I stay in the far left lane and feel bad because people are passing me on the right, but there has to be an open road ahead of me, because unlike everyone else on this road, I can’t slow down.</t5821> <t5822>And this is my role: my role is to drive the car and be anxious.</t5822> <t5823>It occurs to me that I’ve played this role before.</t5823>
<t5824>What about Ben? Ben's role is to feel the need to pee.</t5824> <t5825>At first, it seems like his main role will be to complain about how we don't have any CDs and how all the radio stations in Orlando are terrible, except for the university radio station which is already out of range.</t5825> <t5826>But soon enough, he abandons this role for a more genuine and urgent need: the need to pee.</t5826>
<t5827>“I need to pee,” he says at 15:06.</t5827> <t5828>We have been on the road for forty-three minutes.</t5828> <t5829>We have approximately one day left until the end of our journey.</t5829>
<t5830>“Okay,” says Radar, “the good news is, we will stop.</t5830> <t5831>The bad news is, this will be in four hours and thirty minutes.</t5831><t5832>”</t5832>
<t5833>"I think I can hold it," says Ben.</t5833> <t5834>At 15:10, "Actually, I really need to pee.</t5834> <t5835>Really," he reports.</t5835>
<t5836>We respond in unison: 'Hold it.'</t5836> <t5837>'But I...' he says.</t5837> <t5838>And the chorus responds again: 'Hold it!' For now, while Ben needs to pee and we need to hold it, the journey is fun.</t5838> <t5839>Ben laughs and complains that laughing makes him need to pee more.</t5839> <t5840>Lacey reaches back and tickles him.</t5840>
<t5841>May is starting.</t5841> <t5842>I am laughing, moaning, and I am also laughing while keeping the speedometer at one hundred and fifteen.</t5842> <t5843>I wonder if Margo prepared this trip for us intentionally or by coincidence...</t5843> <t5844>Regardless, this is the most fun I've had since I last spent hours behind the wheel of a minivan.</t5844>
<t5845>Second Hour</t5845>
<t5846>I'm still driving.</t5846> <t5847>We're turning north onto I95, winding our way up through Florida, close to the coast but not right next to it.</t5847> <t5848>Here, everything is pine trees; they're too scrawny for their height, like me.</t5848> <t5849>But mostly it's just the road, the cars we pass and the ones that occasionally pass us, always having to remember who's in front, who's behind, who's approaching and who's moving away.</t5849>
<t5850>Lacey and Ben are now sitting together on a two-seater couch, with Radar in the back. They are all playing a flawed version of the "I Spy" game, where instead of describing things they can see, they try to describe things that are not physically visible to each other.</t5850>
<t5851>"I see something that is tragically fashionable around right now," says Radar.</t5851>
<t5852>“Is it the way Ben smiles more with the right side of his mouth?” asks Lacey.</t5852>
<t5853>"No," says Radar.</t5853> <t5854>"Also, don't be so mushy about Ben.</t5854> <t5855>It's disgusting.</t5855><t5856>"</t5856>
<t5857>“The idea of wearing nothing under your graduation gown, then having to go to New York while everyone in the passing cars thinks you're wearing a dress?</t5857><t5858>”</t5858>
<t5859>“No,” says Radar.</t5859> <t5860>“This is just tragic.</t5860><t5861>”</t5861>
<t5862>Lacey is smiling.</t5862> <t5863>“You will learn to love the dresses.</t5863> <t5864>You will enjoy the breeze.</t5864><t5865>”</t5865>
<t5866>“Ah, I know!” I say from the front.</t5866> <t5867>“You see a twenty-four-hour journey in a minivan.</t5867> <t5868>Fashionable, because journeys are always like that; tragic because the gasoline we guzzle will destroy the planet.”</t5868> <t5869>Radar says no and they continue to guess.</t5869> <t5870>I'm driving the car, going at one hundred fifteen, and playing Metaphysical I Spy while praying not to get a speeding ticket.</t5870> <t5871>It turns out that the tragically fashionable thing is not returning the rented graduation gown on time.</t5871> <t5872>I speed past a police car parked on the median like the wind.</t5872> <t5873>Gripping the steering wheel tightly with both hands, I'm certain it will quickly come to pull us over.</t5873> <t5874>But it doesn't.</t5874> <t5875>Maybe it knows that I'm speeding only because I have to.</t5875>
<t5876>Third Hour</t5876>
<t5877>I'm still sitting in the front.</t5877> <t5878>I'm still driving.</t5878> <t5879>We're all hungry.</t5879> <t5880>Lacey is handing out a plant-based gum to each of us, but it's not much of a consolation.</t5880> <t5881>When we first stop, she writes a massive list of everything we need to get from BP.</t5881> <t5882>It better be an unusually well-stocked BP station because it looks like we're going to clean it out.</t5882>
<t5883>I'm swinging my legs up and down.</t5883>
<t5884>“Can you cut this?</t5884><t5885>”</t5885>
<t5886>"I have needed to pee for three hours."</t5886><t5887>"</t5887>
<t5888>“You had mentioned this.</t5888><t5889>”</t5889>
<t5890>“I can feel the pee up to my chest,” he says.</t5890> <t5891>“I am really full of pee.</t5891> <t5892>Brother, right now seventy percent of my body weight is pee.</t5892><t5893>”</t5893>
<t5894>"Uh-huh," I say, barely managing a smile.</t5894> <t5895>It's actually funny, but I'm tired.</t5895>
<t5896>“I feel like I'm about to cry and pee will come out of my eyes.</t5896><t5897>”</t5897>
<t5898>This time, I am laughing a little.</t5898>
<t5899>When I look again a few minutes later, I see that Ben has tightly placed one of his hands between his legs and the fabric of the robe is wrinkled.</t5899>
<t5900>“What is happening?” I ask.</t5900>
<t5901>"Buddy, I have to do it.</t5901> <t5902>I'm pushing it."</t5902> <t5903>With that, he turns around.</t5903> <t5904>"Radar, how long until we stop?</t5904><t5905>"</t5905>
<t5906>“We need to travel at least two hundred and thirty more kilometers to make just four stops, which means one hour and fifty-eight and a half minutes, if Q maintains the same speed.</t5906><t5907>”</t5907>
<t5908>“I’m protecting!” I shout.</t5908> <t5909>We are just north of Jacksonville, approaching Georgia.</t5909>
<t5910>“I won't be able to do it, Radar.</t5910> <t5911>Find me something to pee into.</t5911><t5912>”</t5912>
<t5913>The chorus shouts: NO.</t5913> <t5914>Absolutely not.</t5914> <t5915>Hold your pee like a man.</t5915> <t5916>Hold it like a Victorian lady clings to her virginity.</t5916> <t5917>Hold it with nobility and grace, as the President of the United States should hold the fate of the free world in his hands.</t5917>
<t5918>"GIVE ME SOMETHING OR I'LL PEE ON THIS CHAIR."</t5918> <t5919>"HURRY UP!"</t5919>
<t5920>"Oh, God," says Radar as he unbuckles his seatbelt.</t5920> <t5921>He reaches to the back, then opens the cooler.</t5921> <t5922>He turns back to his seat, leans forward, and hands a beer to Ben.</t5922>
<t5923>“Anyway, open the cap,” says Ben, opening the bottle with the cloth he squeezed in his palm.</t5923> <t5924>He lowers the window and as the beer slips out from the side of the car and hits the interstate road, I watch it from the side mirror.</t5924> <t5925>Ben, according to him, is going to show us the biggest balls in the world</t5925><t5926>.</t5926>
<t5927>then, he manages to slip the bottle under his robe and we all sit and wait, too disgusted to look.</t5927>
<t5928>Lacey says, "Couldn't I just hold it?" and we all hear it.</t5928> <t5929>I haven't heard this sound before, but I recognize it nonetheless: It's the sound of pee hitting the bottom of a beer bottle.</t5929> <t5930>It almost sounds like music.</t5930> <t5931>Disgusting music with a very fast tempo.</t5931> <t5932>I glance over in that direction and see the relief in Ben's eyes.</t5932> <t5933>He's smiling as he looks off into the distance.</t5933>
<t5934>“The longer you wait, the better it feels,” he says.</t5934> <t5935>In a short time, the sound changes from the tinkling of pee in the bottle to the splashing of pee in pee.</t5935> <t5936>Then Ben's smile slowly fades.</t5936>
<t5937>“Brother, I think I need another bottle,” he says suddenly.</t5937>
<t5938>“One more bottle, NOW,” I shout.</t5938>
<t5939>“Another bottle is coming!” Suddenly, I can see Radar leaning towards the back seat, his head inside the cooler, pulling out a bottle from the ice.</t5939> <t5940>He opens the bottle with his hand, cracks open one of the rear windows, and pours the beer out through the gap.</t5940> <t5941>Then he leans forward, his head between Ben and me, and hands the bottle to Ben, whose eyes are filled with panic.</t5941>
<t5942>“Uh, the replacement thing is a bit, um, complicated,” says Ben.</t5942> <t5943>There’s a lot of fumbling happening under that robe, and when a bottle of Miller Lite (surprisingly resembling urine) emerges from under the robe, I try not to visualize what’s going on.</t5943> <t5944>Ben places the full bottle in the cup holder, grabs a new one from Radar, and then sighs with relief.</t5944>
<t5945>Meanwhile, the rest of us are left to think about the pee in the cup holder.</t5945> <t5946>The road isn't too bumpy, but the jolts in the minivan are quite unpleasant, so the pee sloshes back and forth at the mouth of the bottle.</t5946>
<t5947>"Ben, if you get pee on my brand new car, I'll cut off your balls."</t5947><t5948>"</t5948>
<t5949>Ben, who is still peeing, looks at me and grins.</t5949> <t5950>"You really need a big knife, brother."</t5950> <t5951>Then I finally hear the flow slowing down.</t5951> <t5952>Soon after, he finishes his business and with a single swift motion, throws the new bottle out the window.</t5952> <t5953>The full one follows it.</t5953>
<t5954>Lacey is fake gagging...</t5954> <t5955>or maybe she's really gagging.</t5955> <t5956>Radar says, "God, did you wake up and drink seventy liters of water this morning?"</t5956>
<t5957>But Ben's eyes are shining.</t5957> <t5958>He raises his fists in a gesture of victory and shouts: "Not a single drop on the seat!</t5958> <t5959>My name is Ben Starling.</t5959> <t5960>First clarinet in the WPL band.</t5960> <t5961>Barrel stance record holder.</t5961> <t5962>Champion of peeing in the car.</t5962> <t5963>I moved the world!</t5963> <t5964>I am the greatest!</t5964><t5965>"</t5965>
<t5966>Thirty-five minutes later, as our third hour is ending, he asks in a low voice: "When were we stopping?"</t5966><t5967></t5967>
<t5968>“In one hour and three minutes, if Q maintains the same speed,” answers Radar.</t5968>
<t5969>“Okay,” says Ben.</t5969> <t5970>“Okay.</t5970> <t5971>Good.</t5971> <t5972>Because I need to pee.</t5972><t5973>”</t5973>
<t5974>Fourth Hour</t5974>
<t5975>For the first time, Lacey asks, "Aren't we there yet?"</t5975> <t5976>We laugh.</t5976> <t5977>However, we are in Georgia, the state I love and adore for one reason and one reason only: The speed limit here is one hundred fifteen kilometers per hour, which means I can increase my speed to one hundred twenty-nine.</t5977> <t5978>Besides, Georgia reminds me of Florida.</t5978>
<t5979>We are spending this hour preparing for our first break.</t5979> <t5980>This is an important break because I am very, very, very, very hungry and thirsty.</t5980> <t5981>For some reason, talking about the food we will get at BF eases my stomach pains.</t5981> <t5982>Lacey is preparing shopping lists for each of us, written in small letters on the back of receipts she found in her bag.</t5982> <t5983>She asks Ben to lean out of the front seat window to see which side the gas cap is on.</t5983> <t5984>She forces us to memorize our food lists and then quizzes us.</t5984> <t5985>We discuss our visit to the gas station from start to finish many times; it needs to be executed as well as a pit stop for a race car.</t5985>
<t5986>“Once more,” says Lacey.</t5986>
<t5987>“I will fill up the gas,” says Radar.</t5987> <t5988>“After I start filling, although I normally need to stay by the car, I run inside to give you the card while the pump is pumping.</t5988> <t5989>Then I return to the car.</t5989><t5990>”</t5990>
<t5991>"I'm taking the card to the man at the counter," says Lacey.</t5991>
<t5992>"Or to the woman," I add.</t5992>
<t5993>“Irrelevant,” Lacey replies.</t5993>
<t5994>“I just wanted to say...</t5994> <t5995>don't be so sexist.</t5995><t5996>”</t5996>
<t5997>"Oh, whatever, Q."</t5997> <t5998>"I take the card to the person at the checkout."</t5998> <t5999>"I tell the woman or man to scan everything we brought."</t5999> <t6000>"Then I go to the bathroom."</t6000><t6001>"</t6001>
<t6002>I'm adding: "In the meantime, I'm taking everything on my list and bringing it to the front.</t6002><t6003>"</t6003>
<t6004>Ben, 'And I am peeing.'</t6004> <t6005>Then, when I finish peeing, I get the items on my list," he says.</t6005>
<t6006>“The most important thing is the t-shirts,” says Radar, “people look at me strangely.</t6006><t6007>”</t6007>
<t6008>Lacey says, "I'll sign the receipt after I come out of the bathroom."</t6008>
<t6009>“As soon as the tank is full, I'm getting in the minivan and leaving, so you better be there.</t6009> <t6010>Seriously, I'll leave your asses here.</t6010> <t6011>You have six minutes,” says Radar.</t6011>
<t6012>“Six minutes,” I say, nodding my head.</t6012> <t6013>Lacey and Ben repeat it too.</t6013> <t6014>“Six minutes.” “Six minutes.” At 5:35 in the afternoon,</t6014>
<t6015>While there are one thousand four hundred and fifty kilometers to go, Radar informs us, according to the handheld computer, that there is a BP at the next exit.</t6015>
<t6016>As I pull into the gas station, Lacey and Radar are crouched by the sliding door in the back.</t6016> <t6017>Ben, whose seatbelt is unfastened, has one hand on the front door handle and the other on the panel.</t6017> <t6018>I maintain as much speed as I can for as long as I can, and then I slam on the brakes right in front of the gas pump.</t6018> <t6019>The minivan comes to a jarring stop, and we fly out of the doors.</t6019> <t6020>We meet Radar in front of the car; I toss him the keys and run all the way to the store.</t6020> <t6021>Lacey and Ben have passed me on their way to the door, but only just barely.</t6021> <t6022>As Ben darts towards the restroom, Lacey explains to the gray-haired woman (a woman, really!) that we’re going to buy a lot of things, we’re in a big hurry, she needs to ring up the items as we bring them, and it will all be charged to the BP card; the woman looks a bit bewildered but agrees.</t6022> <t6023>Radar runs in with his robe flapping and hands the card to Lacey.</t6023>
<t6024>Meanwhile, I am running between the aisles, grabbing the items on my list.</t6024> <t6025>Lacey is in the beverages section; Ben is in the durable goods section; and I am in the food section.</t6025> <t6026>I am sweeping through the market like a cheetah, devouring chips like they are wounded gazelles.</t6026> <t6027>With an armful of chips, dried meat, and peanuts, I run to the front register, then head back to the candy aisle.</t6027> <t6028>A handful of Mentos, a handful of Snickers, and...</t6028> <t6029>Oh, it's not on the list but who cares, I love Nerds...</t6029> <t6030>So I add three packs of Nerds.</t6030>
<t6031>I run again and then head towards the appetizer section filled with ancient turkey sandwiches, where the turkey inside resembles ham too much.</t6031> <t6032>I take two.</t6032> <t6033>On my way back to the checkout, I stop for a few Starbursts, a Twinkies, and an unlimited number of GoFast wafers.</t6033> <t6034>I run back.</t6034> <t6035>There I am, standing in my graduation gown, handing the woman the t-shirts and the four-dollar sunglasses.</t6035>
<t6036>is extending.</t6036> <t6037>Lacey comes running with liters of soda, energy drinks, and bottles of water.</t6037> <t6038>Large bottles, the kind that even Ben's pee couldn't fill.</t6038>
<t6039>“ONE MINUTE!” shouts Lacey, and I panic.</t6039> <t6040>I draw circles, my eyes scan the store, trying to remember what I forgot.</t6040> <t6041>I take a look at my list.</t6041> <t6042>It seems like I got everything, but it feels like I forgot something important.</t6042> <t6043>Come on, Jacobs.</t6043> <t6044>Chips, candy, turkey that looks like ham, peanut butter and jelly sandwich, and...</t6044> <t6045>what?</t6045> <t6046>What’s the other food group?</t6046> <t6047>Meat, chips, candy and and and cheese! “CRACKERS!” I say louder than necessary and rush to the crackers, grabbing cheese crackers, peanut butter crackers, and a few extra Grandma’s cookies, then I run back and throw what I have onto the counter.</t6047> <t6048>The woman has already filled four plastic bags.</t6048> <t6049>Almost a hundred dollars in total, not even counting the gas; I will pay this money back to Lacey’s parents over the summer.</t6049>
<t6050>There is only a single moment of hesitation; the woman at the counter scans my BP card after Lacey.</t6050> <t6051>I glance at my watch.</t6051> <t6052>We need to leave within twenty seconds.</t6052> <t6053>I finally hear the receipt printing.</t6053> <t6054>The woman tears the receipt from the machine, scribbles Lacey's name, and Ben and I grab the bags and dash towards the car.</t6054> <t6055>Radar revs the engine as if urging us to hurry, and we run across the parking lot, Ben's robe fluttering in the wind, making him look vaguely like a dark wizard; only his pale, skinny legs are visible, and his arms are full of nylon bags.</t6055> <t6056>From under her dress, I can see the backs of Lacey's legs, her calves tightening mid-stride.</t6056> <t6057>I don't know how I look, but I know how I feel: Young.</t6057> <t6058>Foolish.</t6058> <t6059>Infinite.</t6059> <t6060>I watch Lacey and Ben dive into the open sliding door.</t6060> <t6061>Following them, I tumble onto Lacey with the nylon bags.</t6061> <t6062>As Ben noisily shuts the sliding door, Radar floors the gas pedal, then quickly exits the parking lot, and the minivan, which no one ever used to leave tire marks anywhere, long and full of stories</t6062>
<t6063>is making a first in its ornate history.</t6063> <t6064>Radar turns left onto the main road at a speed that isn't very safe, then gets onto the interstate.</t6064> <t6065>We are four seconds ahead of schedule.</t6065> <t6066>And just like in NASCAR pit stops, we high-five each other.</t6066> <t6067>We have secured enough supplies.</t6067> <t6068>Ben has plenty of containers to pee in.</t6068> <t6069>I have my sufficient share of dried meat.</t6069> <t6070>Lacey has Mentos.</t6070> <t6071>Radar and Ben have t-shirts to wear instead of their robes.</t6071> <t6072>The minivan has turned into a biosphere...</t6072> <t6073>Give us gas, and we can keep going forever.</t6073>
<t6074>Fifth Hour</t6074>
<t6075>Okay, maybe despite everything, we are not that well-prepared.</t6075> <t6076>In the rush of the moment, it turns out that Ben and I made some mistakes (though not fatal).</t6076> <t6077>Radar is alone in the front, Ben and I are sitting in the first double seat, emptying each bag and handing what we got to Lacey in the back.</t6077> <t6078>Lacey sorts the items into groups based on a scheme that only she understands.</t6078>
<t6079>“Why isn't NyQuil in the same pile as NoDoz?” I ask.</t6079> <t6080>“Shouldn't all the medications be together?</t6080><t6081>”</t6081>
<t6082>“Q.</t6082> <t6083>Sweetheart.</t6083> <t6084>You are a man.</t6084> <t6085>You don't know how to do these things.</t6085> <t6086>NoDoz, chocolate, and Mountain Dew together because they all contain caffeine and help you stay awake.</t6086> <t6087>NyQuil with jerky because eating meat makes you feel tired.</t6087><t6088>”</t6088>
<t6089>“Fascinating,” I say.</t6089> <t6090>After handing the last of the food from my bags to Lacey, Lacey asks, “Q, the thing...</t6090> <t6091>you know...</t6091> <t6092>where is the good food?”</t6092>
<t6093>11 A medication that reduces cold symptoms, (exp.</t6093> <t6094>n.</t6094><t6095>)</t6095>
<t6096>12 Caffeine-containing, a drug that makes one awake, (cf.</t6096> <t6097>n.</t6097><t6098>)</t6098>
<t6099>“What?</t6099><t6100>”</t6100>
<t6101>Lacey is reading a copy of the shopping list she wrote for me.</t6101> <t6102>“Bananas.</t6102> <t6103>Apples.</t6103> <t6104>Dried blueberries.</t6104> <t6105>Raisins.”</t6105> <t6106>“Oh,” I say.</t6106> <t6107>“Oh, right.</t6107> <t6108>The fourth food group wasn't crackers.”</t6108> <t6109>“Q!” she says angrily.</t6109> <t6110>“I can't eat any of these.”</t6110> <t6111>I put my hand on her elbow.</t6111> <t6112>“You can eat Grandma’s peanut butter cookies.</t6112> <t6113>They taste like Grandma made them.</t6113> <t6114>Grandma wouldn't harm you.</t6114><t6115>”</t6115>
<t6116>Lacey blows a strand of hair away from her face.</t6116> <t6117>She really looks upset.</t6117> <t6118>“Besides,” I say, “they have GoFast wafers.</t6118> <t6119>They are fortified with vitamins!</t6119><t6120>”</t6120>
<t6121>“Yes, vitamins and about thirty grams of fat,” he says.</t6121>
<t6122>From the front, Radar announces, "Don't start talking badly about GoFast.</t6122> <t6123>Do you want me to stop this car?"</t6123>
<t6124>“Whenever I eat a GoFast,” says Ben, “the first thing that comes to my mind is, ‘So this is what blood tastes like to mosquitoes.’”</t6124> <t6125>I open a bit of a soft and chocolaty GoFast wafer and hold it in front of Lacey's mouth.</t6125> <t6126>“Just smell it,” I say.</t6126> <t6127>“Smell the vitamin-rich flavor.</t6127><t6128>”</t6128>
<t6129>“You will make me fat.</t6129><t6130>”</t6130>
<t6131>“Also, he has pimples,” says Ben.</t6131> <t6132>“Don't forget the pimples.</t6132><t6133>”</t6133>
<t6134>Lacey reluctantly takes a bite of the waffle.</t6134> <t6135>She has to close her eyes to hide the orgasmic pleasure inherent in tasting GoFast.</t6135> <t6136>“Ah.</t6136> <t6137>My God.</t6137> <t6138>It tastes just like hope feels.</t6138><t6139>”</t6139>
<t6140>Finally, we empty the last bag.</t6140> <t6141>Inside, there are two large T-shirts that Ben and Radar get very excited about when they see them, because it means they can be "guys who wear gigantic T-shirts" instead of "guys who wear stupid clothes."</t6141>
<t6142>But when Ben unfolds the t-shirts, two small problems arise.</t6142> <t6143>The first is that an oversized t-shirt from a Georgia gas station,</t6143>
<t6144>for example, it turns out that the plus-size t-shirt at Old Navy is not the same size.</t6144> <t6145>The t-shirt at the gas station is gigantic...</t6145> <t6146>More like a trash bag than a t-shirt.</t6146> <t6147>Smaller than graduation gowns but not by much.</t6147> <t6148>But this issue pales in comparison to the fact that both t-shirts have embossed Confederate flags on them.</t6148> <t6149>The words NOT HATE BUT HERITAGE are written on the flag.</t6149>
<t6150>“Oh no, this can't be real,” says Radar when I show him why we are laughing.</t6150> <t6151>“I hope you didn't get a racist t-shirt for your token black friend, Starling.</t6151><t6152>”</t6152>
<t6153>“I just grabbed the first t-shirts I saw, brother.</t6153><t6154>”</t6154>
<t6155>“Don't call me brother right now,” says Radar, but I nod and smile.</t6155> <t6156>I hand him the T-shirt, and he tries to put it on while steering the car with his knees.</t6156> <t6157>“I hope they pull me over,” he says.</t6157> <t6158>“I want to see how the police will react to a black guy wearing a Confederate T-shirt over a black outfit.</t6158><t6159>”</t6159>
<t6160>Sixth Hour</t6160>
<t6161>For some reason, Florence, South Carolina, south of 195, is the fashionable place to drive on a Friday evening.</t6161> <t6162>We are buried in traffic for a few kilometers, and although Radar has no choice but to violate the speed limit, it's lucky if he can even go fifty.</t6162> <t6163>I'm sitting in the front with Radar, and we are trying to keep our worries at bay by playing a game we just invented called This Guy Is a Gigolo.</t6163> <t6164>In the game, you imagine the lives of the people in the cars around you.</t6164>
<t6165>We are driving side by side with a Hispanic woman in a rather old Toyota Corolla.</t6165> <t6166>I am watching the woman through the early falling darkness.</t6166> <t6167>"She left her family to move here," I say.</t6167> <t6168>"Illegal.</t6168> <t6169>She sends money home on the third day of every month.</t6169> <t6170>Two small children</t6170>
<t6171>Her husband is an immigrant.</t6171> <t6172>Currently, he is in Ohio, spending only three or four months a year at home, but they still get along really well.</t6172><t6173>”</t6173>
<t6174>Radar leans forward and glances at the woman for a second.</t6174> <t6175>“My God, Q, it's not that melodramatic.</t6175> <t6176>A secretary in a law firm...</t6176> <t6177>look at how she's dressed.</t6177> <t6178>It took her five years, but now she's about to get her own law degree.</t6178> <t6179>And she doesn't have a child or a husband.</t6179> <t6180>She does have a boyfriend, though.</t6180> <t6181>The guy is a bit flighty.</t6181> <t6182>He's afraid of commitment.</t6182> <t6183>He's afraid of being criticized for having a 'fetish for black women' because of his pale skin.</t6183><t6184>”</t6184>
<t6185>“He’s wearing a ring,” I point out.</t6185> <t6186>According to Radar’s defense, I have the opportunity to look at him for a long time.</t6186> <t6187>To my right, just below me.</t6187> <t6188>I can see him through the dark-tinted window and watch him as he sings along to a song, his eyes never blinking, focused on the road.</t6188> <t6189>There are so many people.</t6189> <t6190>It’s so easy to forget that the world is full of people...</t6190> <t6191>so full that each of those people can be imagined and is continuously imagined incorrectly.</t6191> <t6192>This strikes me as an important idea, one of those ideas that the brain needs to slowly wrap around like a python eating its prey, but before I can go any further, Radar speaks.</t6192>
<t6193>“She only wears the ring so creeps like you won't come onto her,” explains Radar.</t6193>
<t6194>“Maybe.” I smile, taking a bite from the half-eaten GoFast wafer in my lap.</t6194> <t6195>We remain silent for a while, and I think about the ways of seeing or not seeing people and the dark-colored windows between us and the woman still walking right beside us; on this crowded highway, as the woman moves slowly with us, we are both inside the cars with all those windows and mirrors.</t6195> <t6196>When Radar starts talking again, I realize that he has been thinking too.</t6196>
<t6197>“The event in 'That Guy is a Gigolo',” says Radar, “I mean, as an event in a game, ultimately reveals much more about the person imagining it than the person being imagined.</t6197><t6198>”</t6198>
<t6199>“Yes,” I say.</t6199> <t6200>“I was just thinking the same thing.”</t6200> <t6201>And despite all of Whitman’s terrible beauty, I can’t help but think he might be a bit too optimistic.</t6201> <t6202>We can hear others, go to them without moving, imagine them, and like a bunch of blades of grass, we are all connected by a crazy root system...</t6202> <t6203>but this game makes me wonder if we can really become someone completely different.</t6203>
<t6204>Seventh Hour</t6204>
<t6205>Finally, we pass by a truck lying on its side and speed up again, but Radar calculates that we need to maintain an average of one hundred twenty-four from here to Agloe.</t6205> <t6206>It has been exactly one hour since Ben announced that he needed to pee, and the reason is simple: he is sleeping.</t6206> <t6207>He took NyQuil exactly at six o'clock.</t6207> <t6208>He lay down in the back, and Lacey and I fastened both seat belts on him.</t6208> <t6209>This made him even more uncomfortable but 1.</t6209> <t6210>It was for his own good and 2.</t6210> <t6211>We all knew that within twenty minutes, no discomfort would matter to him because he would be sleeping like the dead.</t6211> <t6212>And right now, he is in exactly the position we predicted.</t6212> <t6213>He will be woken up at midnight.</t6213> <t6214>I just put Lacey to bed; at nine in the evening, in the same position, in the back seat.</t6214> <t6215>We will wake her up at two in the morning.</t6215> <t6216>The idea is: Everyone will sleep in turns, so that by the time we are about to enter Agloe in the early morning, we won't have to tape our eyelids open.</t6216>
<t6217>The minivan has in a way turned into a small house: I am sitting in the front seat, which serves as a lounge.</t6217> <t6218>I think this is the best room in the house because it is spacious and the seat is quite comfortable.</t6218>
<t6219>The office, where something had been spilled on the traitor under that chair, is the place where Ben received a United States from his BF</t6219>
<t6220>There is a map, the directions I printed out, and a piece of paper on which Radar scribbled his speed and distance calculations.</t6220>
<t6221>Radar is sitting in the driver's seat.</t6221> <t6222>Living room.</t6222> <t6223>It looks a lot like the lounge, but you can't be as comfortable there.</t6223> <t6224>Also, it's cleaner.</t6224>
<t6225>We have a central console between the living room and the lounge, or our kitchen.</t6225> <t6226>Here, we have plenty of dried meat stock, GoFast wafers, and our magical energy drink called Bluefin, which Lacey added to the shopping list.</t6226> <t6227>Bluefin is sold in small glass bottles with cool stripes and tastes like blue cotton candy.</t6227> <t6228>It also keeps you awake better than anything in human history, although it does cause a bit of twitching.</t6228> <t6229>Radar and I agreed to keep drinking Bluefin until two hours before our rest periods.</t6229> <t6230>Mine starts at midnight, when Ben wakes up.</t6230>
<t6231>The front double seat, the first bedroom.</t6231> <t6232>This is the desired bedroom because it is close to the kitchen and living room where people are awake, talking, and sometimes there is music on the radio.</t6232>
<t6233>Behind it, there is a second bedroom that is darker and quieter, and definitely superior to the first one.</t6233>
<t6234>And behind it, there is a refrigerator or cooler containing 210 beers that Ben hasn't yet peed in, turkey sandwiches that resemble ham, and a few sodas.</t6234>
<t6235>There are many things to recommend in this house.</t6235> <t6236>Everywhere is fully equipped.</t6236> <t6237>It has central air conditioning and heating.</t6237> <t6238>There is a sound system throughout.</t6238> <t6239>It's true that there is only seventeen square meters of living space.</t6239> <t6240>But the open studio apartment design is incomparable.</t6240>
<t6241>Eighth</t6241>
<t6242>i</t6242>
<t6243>Right after entering South Carolina, I catch Radar yawning and insist on changing drivers.</t6243> <t6244>I love driving anyway...</t6244> <t6245>This vehicle might be a minivan, but it's my minivan.</t6245> <t6246>As I quickly step over the kitchen and move to the driver's seat, grabbing and holding the steering wheel steady, Radar gets up from his seat and rushes to the first bedroom.</t6246>
<t6247>I am discovering that traveling teaches you a lot about yourself.</t6247> <t6248>For instance, I never thought I was the type of person who would pee into a mostly empty Bluefin energy drink bottle while speeding through South Carolina at one hundred and twenty-four kilometers per hour.</t6248> <t6249>..</t6249> <t6250>but it turns out I am that type of person.</t6250> <t6251>Also, I didn't know beforehand that mixing a little Bluefin energy drink with a large amount of pee would result in a surprisingly dazzling turquoise hue.</t6251> <t6252>It looks so beautiful that I want to cap the bottle and leave it in the cup holder so that Lacey and Ben can see it when they wake up.</t6252>
<t6253>Ama Radar benimle aynı fikirde değil.</t6253> <t6254>“Eğer o boku hemen pencereden dışarı atmazsan, on bir yıllık arkadaşlığımızı bitiriyorum,” diyor.</t6254>
<t6255>“Not poop,” I say.</t6255> <t6256>“Pee.</t6256><t6257>”</t6257>
<t6258>“Outside,” he says.</t6258> <t6259>Upon this, I throw out the garbage.</t6259> <t6260>In the side mirror, I can see the bottle hitting the asphalt and bursting like a water balloon.</t6260> <t6261>Radar sees it too.</t6261>
<t6262>“Ah, God,” says Radar.</t6262> <t6263>“I hope this is one of those traumatic events that terribly damages my soul, so I can forget it immediately.</t6263><t6264>”</t6264>
<t6265>Ninth Hour</t6265>
<t6266>I never knew it was possible to get tired of eating GoFast wafers.</t6266> <t6267>But it is possible.</t6267> <t6268>By the time I felt nauseous, I had only taken two bites of the fourth one of the day.</t6268> <t6269>I pull open the center console and put the GoFast inside.</t6269> <t6270>We call this part of the kitchen the pantry.</t6270>
<t6271>“I wish we had a few apples,” says Radar.</t6271> <t6272>“God, wouldn't an apple be nice right now?</t6272><t6273>”</t6273>
<t6274>I sigh.</t6274> <t6275>Stupid fourth food group.</t6275> <t6276>Also, even though I stopped drinking Bluefin a few hours ago, I still feel extremely tense.</t6276>
<t6277>“I still feel tense,” I say.</t6277>
<t6278>“Yes,” says Radar.</t6278> <t6279>“I can't stop tapping my fingers.”</t6279> <t6280>I look down.</t6280> <t6281>He is quietly drumming on his knees with his fingers.</t6281> <t6282>“I mean,” he says, “I really can't stop.</t6282><t6283>”</t6283>
<t6284>“Alright, yes, I'm not tired, so we will stay up until four, then wake them up and sleep until eight.</t6284><t6285>”</t6285>
<t6286>“Okay,” he says.</t6286> <t6287>There is a pause.</t6287> <t6288>The road is now empty; only the trailer trucks and I are here, I feel my brain processing information at eleven thousand times its usual speed, and I realize that what I'm doing is very simple, that driving on the interstate is the easiest and most enjoyable thing in the world: All I have to do is stay between the lines, make sure no one is too close to me and that I'm not too close to anyone, and keep going.</t6288> <t6289>Maybe it felt the same way to Margo, but I could never feel this way alone.</t6289>
<t6290>Radar breaks the silence.</t6290> <t6291>“Well, if we're not going to sleep until four...</t6291><t6292>”</t6292>
<t6293>I'm finishing my sentence.</t6293> <t6294>"Yes, then we should probably open another bottle of Bluefin.</t6294><t6295>"</t6295>
<t6296>And that's what we do.</t6296>
<t6297>Tenth Hour</t6297>
<t6298>Our second break time.</t6298> <t6299>The time is 00:13 in the morning.</t6299> <t6300>My fingers feel like they are made of movement, not flesh.</t6300> <t6301>While driving, I tickle the steering wheel.</t6301>
<t6302>After finding the nearest BP on the handheld computer, we decide to wake up Lacey and Ben.</t6302>
<t6303>"Hey, kids, we're about to stop," I say.</t6303> <t6304>No reaction.</t6304>
<t6305>Radar turns around and places his hand on Lacey's shoulder.</t6305> <t6306>"Lace, it's time to wake up."</t6306> <t6307>Nothing happens.</t6307>
<t6308>I turn on the radio.</t6308> <t6309>I find a station playing old songs.</t6309> <t6310>The Beatles.</t6310> <t6311>The song is Good Morning.</t6311> <t6312>I turn up the volume a bit.</t6312> <t6313>Not a peep.</t6313> <t6314>So Radar turns it up a bit more.</t6314> <t6315>And then a bit more.</t6315> <t6316>Then the chorus comes, and Radar starts to sing along.</t6316> <t6317>Then I start to sing along too.</t6317> <t6318>I think in the end, it's my off-key screams that wake them up.</t6318>
<t6319>“STOP THAT!” Ben shouts.</t6319> <t6320>We turn off the music.</t6320>
<t6321>"Ben, we're stopping.</t6321> <t6322>Do you need to pee?</t6322><t6323>"</t6323>
<t6324>He hesitates, and I wonder if he has a physical strategy to check the fullness of his bladder when there's a commotion in the darkness behind him.</t6324> <t6325>"I guess it's not necessary," he says.</t6325>
<t6326>“Alright, then you are at the gas station.</t6326><t6327>”</t6327>
<t6328>"As the only guy in this car who hasn't peed himself, I'm going to the bathroom first," says Radar.</t6328>
<t6329>"Shh," Lacey grumbles.</t6329> <t6330>"Shh.</t6330> <t6331>Everyone stop talking.</t6331><t6332>"</t6332>
<t6333>“Lacey, you need to get up and pee,” says Radar.</t6333> <t6334>“We're stopping.</t6334><t6335>”</t6335>
<t6336>"You can take an apple," I say.</t6336>
<t6337>“Apple,” she murmurs happily in a small, sweet girl’s voice.</t6337> <t6338>“I love apples.</t6338><t6339>”</t6339>
<t6340>“Then you move on to driving,” says Radar.</t6340> <t6341>“That's why you really need to wake up.</t6341><t6342>”</t6342>
<t6343>Confirming and in her usual Lacey voice, she says, "I don't like him very much."</t6343>
<t6344>We are taking the exit, and it's about a kilometer to the BP, which doesn't seem like much, but Radar says it will probably cost us four minutes and that the South Carolina traffic is hurting us, so according to him, the roadwork that is an hour away could really cause us problems.</t6344> <t6345>But I have no chance to worry.</t6345> <t6346>Lacey and I, just like last time, have shaken off our sleep enough to line up in front of the sliding door, and when we stop in front of the pump, everyone flies out, I toss the keys to Ben, and he catches them in mid-air.</t6346>
<t6347>As Radar and I quickly pass by the fair-skinned man at the counter, Radar stops when he notices the man staring intently.</t6347> <t6348>"Yes," says Radar unashamedly.</t6348> <t6349>"I'm wearing a shirt that says NOT HATE BUT HERITAGE over my graduation gown," he says.</t6349> <t6350>"By the way, do you sell pants here?</t6350><t6351>"</t6351>
<t6352>Adam looks bewildered.</t6352> <t6353>"There are a few commando pants by the motor oils.</t6353><t6354>"</t6354>
<t6355>“Perfect,” says Radar.</t6355> <t6356>Then he turns to me.</t6356> <t6357>“Be a darling and pick out a pair of cargo pants for me.</t6357> <t6358>And a better t-shirt too.</t6358><t6359>”</t6359>
<t6360>“Consider it done and consider it done,” I reply.</t6360> <t6361>It turns out that commando pants do not have classic numbered sizes.</t6361> <t6362>They come in medium and large sizes.</t6362> <t6363>I get a pair of medium-sized pants and a large-sized pink t-shirt that says WORLD'S BEST GRANDMA on it.</t6363> <t6364>And also three bottles of Bluefin.</t6364>
<t6365>When Lacey comes out of the bathroom, I give her everything, and since Radar is still in the men's room, I go into the women's bathroom.</t6365> <t6366>I can't remember if I've ever been in a women's bathroom at a gas station before.</t6366>
<t6367>Differences.</t6367>
<t6368>There is no condom machine</t6368>
<t6369>There is less graffiti</t6369>
<t6370>No urinal</t6370>
<t6371>The taste is more or less the same, which is a bit disappointing.</t6371>
<t6372>When I step outside, Lacey is paying and Ben is honking the horn. After a moment of confusion, I run towards the car.</t6372>
<t6373>“We lost a minute,” says Ben from the front seat.</t6373> <t6374>Lacey turns onto the street that will take us back to the interstate.</t6374>
<t6375>“Sorry,” replies Radar from the back seat where he’s sitting next to me, trying to get into his new commando pants under his robe.</t6375> <t6376>“On the bright side, I got pants.</t6376> <t6377>And a new T-shirt.</t6377> <t6378>Where’s the T-shirt, Q?” Lacey hands him the T-shirt.</t6378> <t6379>“Very funny.”</t6379> <t6380>He takes off the robe and puts on the grandma T-shirt, while Ben complains that no one got him pants.</t6380> <t6381>His butt itches.</t6381> <t6382>And now he realizes, he feels like he needs to pee.</t6382>
<t6383>Eleventh Hour</t6383>
<t6384>We are approaching the part where the roadwork is.</t6384> <t6385>The main road narrows to a single lane and we get stuck behind a tractor going at the speed limit of fifty-five kilometers per hour.</t6385> <t6386>Lacey is the right driver for this situation; I would be punching the steering wheel, but she sweetly chats with Ben.</t6386>
<t6387>he says, until he turns around: "Q, I really need to go to the bathroom, we're wasting time behind this tractor anyway.</t6387><t6388>"</t6388>
<t6389>I just nod my head.</t6389> <t6390>I can't blame Lacey.</t6390> <t6391>If it were impossible for me to pee into a bottle, I would have forced us to stop long ago.</t6391> <t6392>Holding it in for as long as she did was heroic.</t6392>
<t6393>I pull into a gas station that's open all night, and step outside to stretch my legs that feel like rubber.</t6393> <t6394>When Lacey runs back to the minivan, I'm in the driver's seat.</t6394> <t6395>I don't even know how I got into the driver's seat or why it was me instead of Lacey who ended up there.</t6395> <t6396>She turns and comes to the front door and sees me there, the window is open, and I say to her, "I can drive."</t6396> <t6397>After all, it's my car and my responsibility.</t6397> <t6398>"Are you really sure?" she says, and I reply, "Yes, yes, I'm good enough to go," Lacey just slides open the door and stretches out in the first row.</t6398>
<t6399>The Second Hour</t6399>
<t6400>It's 2:40 in the morning.</t6400> <t6401>Lacey is sleeping, Radar is sleeping.</t6401> <t6402>I'm driving.</t6402> <t6403>The road is desolate.</t6403> <t6404>Even most of the truck drivers have gone to bed.</t6404> <t6405>We go for minutes without seeing headlights in the opposite direction.</t6405> <t6406>He keeps talking beside me to keep me awake.</t6406> <t6407>We are talking about Margo.</t6407>
<t6408>"Have you ever actually thought about, well, how we would find Agloe?" he asks.</t6408>
<t6409>“Ah, I have an idea about the intersection,” I say.</t6409> <t6410>“It is nothing but an intersection.</t6410><t6411>”</t6411>
<t6412>“And Margo will be there, just sitting in a corner of the luggage, with her hands on her chin, waiting for you?</t6412><t6413>”</t6413>
<t6414>“That would definitely be helpful,” I reply.</t6414>
<t6415>“Brother, I must say that if things don't go as you planned, you might be really disappointed, and I'm a bit worried about that.</t6415><t6416>”</t6416>
<t6417>“I just want to find him,” I say, because that's what I want.</t6417> <t6418>I want him to be safe, alive, and found.</t6418> <t6419>All strings have been pulled.</t6419> <t6420>The rest is insignificant.</t6420>
<t6421>“Yes, but... I don't know,” says Ben.</t6421> <t6422>I can feel that he has turned into Serious Ben and is looking at me.</t6422> <t6423>“It's just...</t6423> <t6424>Just remember that sometimes people aren't exactly as you think they are.</t6424> <t6425>Like how I think Lacey is very sexy, very amazing, and very cool, but now when it comes to actually being with her...</t6425> <t6426>it's not exactly the same, people are different when you can feel them, when you can see them up close.</t6426><t6427>”</t6427>
<t6428>“I know this,” I say.</t6428> <t6429>I know how long, how badly, and how wrongly I have imagined Margo.</t6429>
<t6430>“I'm just saying it was easy for me to like Lacey from a distance before.</t6430> <t6431>It's easy to love someone from afar.</t6431> <t6432>But when she stopped being surprisingly unattainable and started being an ordinary girl with a weird relationship with food, often cranky and a bit bossy...</t6432> <t6433>then I had to start liking a completely different person.</t6433><t6434>”</t6434>
<t6435>I can feel my cheeks burning.</t6435> <t6436>"Are you saying that I really don't like Margo?</t6436> <t6437>After all this...</t6437> <t6438>I've been in this car for twelve hours and you don't think I care about her because I...”</t6438> <t6439>I cut myself off.</t6439> <t6440>“Do you think you can stand on top of the high mountains and lecture me just because you have a girlfriend?</t6440> <t6441>So much...</t6441><t6442>”</t6442>
<t6443>I stop talking because outside, at the very edge of where the headlights can reach, I see the thing that will soon kill me.</t6443>
<t6444>Two cows are standing on the main road with indifferent attitudes.</t6444> <t6445>They suddenly appear; a spotted cow in the left lane and in our lane, a massive creature the width of a car stands completely motionless, its head turned backward as it tries to perceive us.</t6445> <t6446>The cow is perfectly white; an enormous white wall made of cow, which cannot be climbed over, passed under, or bypassed.</t6446> <t6447>The only option is to crash.</t6447> <t6448>I know Ben sees it too because I hear his breath catch.</t6448>
<t6449>They say that your life flashes before your eyes like a film strip, but that's not the case for me.</t6449> <t6450>Before my eyes, nothing passes except for this incredibly vast, snow-like fur that is now just a second away from us.</t6450> <t6451>I don't know what to do.</t6451> <t6452>No, that's not the problem.</t6452> <t6453>The problem is that there's nothing to do except crash into this white wall and kill both it and ourselves.</t6453> <t6454>I'm slamming on the brakes out of habit, with no expectation: it's impossible to avoid this.</t6454> <t6455>I take my hands off the steering wheel and raise them up.</t6455> <t6456>I don't know why I'm doing this, but I raise my hands, as if I'm surrendering.</t6456> <t6457>I'm thinking about the most boring thing in the world: I'm thinking that I don't want this to happen.</t6457> <t6458>I don't want to die.</t6458> <t6459>I don't want my friends to die.</t6459> <t6460>Also, to be honest, as time slows down and my hands are in the air, I have the strength for one more thought and I think of Margo.</t6460> <t6461>I blame her for this absurd, deadly chase...</t6461> <t6462>for putting us in danger; for turning me into the kind of fool who drives fast all night without sleeping.</t6462> <t6463>If it weren't for her, I wouldn't be dying.</t6463> <t6464>I would be at home as always, safe, and doing the only thing I've ever wanted to do, which is to grow up.</t6464>
<t6465>While having handed over control of the helm, I am surprised to see a hand on the steering wheel.</t6465> <t6466>We are turning before I understand why we are turning; then, I realize that Ben is turning the wheel towards himself, putting us in the desperate expectation of missing the cow, first on the shoulder, then on the grass.</t6466> <t6467>Ben, the wheel hard and</t6467>
<t6468>While quickly turning the other way, I can hear the tires spinning furiously.</t6468> <t6469>I stop watching.</t6469> <t6470>I don't know if my eyes closed or if they just stopped seeing.</t6470> <t6471>My stomach and lungs meet in the middle and crush each other.</t6471> <t6472>Something sharp hits my cheek.</t6472> <t6473>We stop.</t6473>
<t6474>I don't know why, but I touch my face.</t6474> <t6475>I pull my hand back, there's a trace of blood.</t6475> <t6476>Wrapping my arms around myself, I touch my arms just to make sure they're there, they are.</t6476> <t6477>I look at my legs.</t6477> <t6478>They're there.</t6478> <t6479>There's some glass.</t6479> <t6480>I look around.</t6480> <t6481>Bottles are broken.</t6481> <t6482>I am looking at me.</t6482> <t6483>I touch my face.</t6483> <t6484>It looks fine.</t6484> <t6485>Just like I am hugging myself, he is hugging himself.</t6485> <t6486>His body is still intact.</t6486> <t6487>He just looks at me.</t6487> <t6488>I can see him in the rearview mirror.</t6488> <t6489>But now, belatedly, he screams.</t6489> <t6490>He looks at me and screams, his mouth wide open, his scream hoarse, muffled, and terrified.</t6490> <t6491>He stops screaming.</t6491> <t6492>There's something wrong with me.</t6492> <t6493>I feel like I'm going to faint.</t6493> <t6494>My chest is burning.</t6494> <t6495>And then I gulp air.</t6495> <t6496>I had forgotten to breathe.</t6496> <t6497>I've been holding my breath all this time.</t6497> <t6498>When I start breathing again, I feel much better.</t6498> <t6499>In through the nose, out through the mouth.</t6499>
<t6500>“Who is injured?!” shouts Lacey.</t6500> <t6501>She unbuckles her seatbelt, gets out of her sleeping position, and leans towards the back.</t6501> <t6502>When I turn around, I can see that the back door is open, and for a moment I think Radar has been thrown out of the car, but Radar straightens up.</t6502> <t6503>He quickly runs his hands over his face and says, “I'm fine.</t6503> <t6504>I'm fine.</t6504> <t6505>Is everyone okay?”</t6505>
<t6506>Lacey doesn't even respond; she just jumps forward, between Ben and me.</t6506> <t6507>She leans against the kitchen and looks at Ben.</t6507> <t6508>“Sweetheart, where are you hurt?” she says.</t6508> <t6509>Her eyes are filled, like a swimming pool on a rainy day.</t6509> <t6510>And Ben says, “I'm fineI'mfineQ'sbleeding,” he says.</t6510>
<t6511>Lacey is turning to me, I shouldn't cry but I am crying, not because I am hurt, but because I am scared, because I raised my hands and</t6511>
<t6512>Because Ben saved me, there is now a girl looking after me, and she looks at me in a way a mother would, which shouldn't make me feel vulnerable, but it does.</t6512> <t6513>I know the cut on my cheek isn't bad and I'm trying to say so, but I keep crying.</t6513> <t6514>Lacey gently and softly presses on the cut with her fingers and yells at Ben to find something that can be used as a bandage; then I have a bandage made from a Confederate flag pressed against my cheek, just to the right of my nose.</t6514> <t6515>Lacey says, "Hold it there tightly; it's okay, does anything else hurt?" and I say no.</t6515> <t6516>At that moment, I realize the car is still running, in gear, and only stopped because I am still pressing the brake.</t6516> <t6517>I shift the car into park and turn off the engine.</t6517> <t6518>When I turn it off, I can hear a liquid flowing...</t6518> <t6519>It's not dripping, more like pouring.</t6519>
<t6520>“We should probably go outside,” says Radar.</t6520> <t6521>I press the Confederate flag against my face.</t6521> <t6522>The sound of the liquid spilling out of the car continues.</t6522>
<t6523>"Gasoline! It's going to explode!" Ben shouts.</t6523> <t6524>He quickly opens the front door and runs out in a panic.</t6524> <t6525>He starts running across the meadow, jumping over a wooden fence.</t6525> <t6526>Meanwhile, I also go outside, but I'm not in such a hurry.</t6526> <t6527>Radar is also outside, and while Ben is running away with his heels hitting his backside, Radar is laughing.</t6527> <t6528>"Beer," he says.</t6528>
<t6529>“What?</t6529><t6530>”</t6530>
<t6531>"All the beers are broken," he says, nodding his head towards the opened cooler, from which liters of foamy liquid are spilling out.</t6531>
<t6532>We're trying to call Ben, but he can't hear us because he's busy yelling "IT'S GOING TO EXPLODE!" while running across the stream.</t6532> <t6533>His graduation gown is fluttering in the gray dawn, exposing his bare, skinny butt.</t6533>
<t6534>When I hear a car coming, I turn and look at the main road.</t6534> <t6535>The white monster and its spotted friend trot across to the opposite bank.</t6535>
<t6536>They have successfully secured themselves, still indifferent.</t6536> <t6537>When I turn around, I notice that the minivan is leaning against the fence.</t6537>
<t6538>Ben, nihayet arabaya dönerken, zararı değerlendiriyorum.</t6538> <t6539>Dönerken çiti sıyırıp geçmiş olmalıyız çünkü sürgülü kapıda derin bir göçük var, yakından bakıldığında minivanın içini gösterecek kadar derin.</t6539> <t6540>Fakat bunun dışında tertemiz görünüyor.</t6540> <t6541>Başka çökük yok.</t6541> <t6542>Kırılan pencere yok.</t6542> <t6543>Patlak lastik yok.</t6543> <t6544>Arka kapıyı kapatmak ve hâlâ köpüren, kırılmış 210 şişe birayı değerlendirmek için arkaya doğru yürüyorum.</t6544> <t6545>Lacey beni bulup bir kolunu bana doluyor, ikimiz de köpüren bira deresinin, altımızdaki drenaj çukurunun içine akmasını izliyoruz.</t6545> <t6546>“Ne oldu?” diye soruyor Lacey.</t6546>
<t6547>I'm telling you: We had died, then I managed to turn the car in the right direction like a wonderful vehicle ballerina.</t6547>
<t6548>Ben and Radar have gotten under the minivan.</t6548> <t6549>Neither of them knows a damn thing about cars, but I guess it makes them feel better.</t6549> <t6550>The edge of Ben's robe and his bare calves are sticking out.</t6550>
<t6551>“My friend,” shouts Radar.</t6551> <t6552>“It looks good.</t6552><t6553>”</t6553>
<t6554>“Radar,” I say, “the car spun around about eight times.</t6554> <t6555>It definitely can't be good.</t6555><t6556>”</t6556>
<t6557>“Well, it looks good,” says Radar.</t6557>
<t6558>“Hey,” I say, holding Ben’s New Balance shoes.</t6558> <t6559>“Hey, get out.”</t6559> <t6560>He crawls out, and I extend my hand to help him up.</t6560> <t6561>His hands are darkened with a sticky substance from the car.</t6561> <t6562>I grab him and hug him.</t6562> <t6563>If I hadn’t handed over control of the steering wheel, if he hadn’t taken control of it so skillfully, I would have died.</t6563> <t6564>“Thanks,” I say, probably patting his back too hard.</t6564> <t6565>“That was the best passenger seat driving I’ve ever seen.</t6565><t6566>”</t6566>
<t6567>He hits my uninjured cheek with his greasy hand.</t6567> <t6568>“I did it to save myself, not you,” he says.</t6568> <t6569>“Believe me, you never crossed my mind even once.</t6569><t6570>”</t6570>
<t6571>I am laughing.</t6571> <t6572>“You too, mine,” I say.</t6572>
<t6573>He looks at me, about to smile, then adds: ‘I mean, the damn cow was really huge.</t6573> <t6574>It was more like a beached whale than a cow.”</t6574> <t6575>I laugh.</t6575>
<t6576>At that moment, Radar is crawling out.</t6576> <t6577>"Buddy, I really think you're doing well.</t6577> <t6578>I mean, we only lost about five minutes.</t6578> <t6579>We don't even have to increase our steady speed.</t6579><t6580>"</t6580>
<t6581>Lacey is looking at the dent in the minivan, her lips pursed.</t6581> <t6582>“What are you thinking?” I ask.</t6582>
<t6583>"Continue," he says.</t6583>
<t6584>“Go on,” Radar agrees.</t6584>
<t6585>I'm puffing out my cheeks and blowing out my breath.</t6585> <t6586>"I continue mainly because I'm influenced by social pressure.</t6586><t6587>"</t6587>
<t6588>“Continue,” I say.</t6588> <t6589>“But I am as sure as my name that I will not drive the car any longer.</t6589><t6590>”</t6590>
<t6591>Ben is taking the keys from me.</t6591> <t6592>We are getting into the minivan.</t6592> <t6593>Radar is guiding us to slowly exit the shoulder and get back onto the interstate.</t6593> <t6594>We are 872 kilometers away from Agloe.</t6594>
<t6595>Thirteenth Hour</t6595>
<t6596>Every few minutes, Radar says, "Kids, do you all remember the time we were definitely going to die, then Ben grabbed the wheel, swerved the car like a teacup ride at the amusement park to avoid the gigantic damn cow, and we didn't die?</t6596><t6597>"</t6597>
<t6598>Lacey is leaning over the counter, her hand on Ben's shoulder.</t6598> <t6599>"So, you're a hero, did you realize that?</t6599> <t6600>They give medals for things like this.</t6600><t6601>"</t6601>
<t6602>“I said it before and I will say it again: I wasn't thinking about any of you.</t6602> <t6603>My own.</t6603> <t6604>Ass.</t6604> <t6605>To save.</t6605> <t6606>I wanted.</t6606><t6607>”</t6607>
<t6608>"You liar.</t6608> <t6609>You brave, adorable liar," she says and plants a kiss on his cheek.</t6609>
<t6610>Radar, "Hey kids, do you remember the time I was strapped in the back with a double seatbelt, my door suddenly opened, and the beer spilled but I definitely escaped without injury?"</t6610> <t6611>"How could that be possible?" he says.</t6611>
<t6612>“Let's play I See Metaphysics,” says Lacey.</t6612> <t6613>“Right now, I see a hero's heart around, a heart that beats not for itself, but for humanity.</t6613><t6614>”</t6614>
<t6615>“I'M NOT BEING MODEST.</t6615> <t6616>I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO DIE,” Ben shouts.</t6616>
<t6617>"Kids, do you remember that one time in the minivan, twenty minutes ago, when we somehow didn't die?"</t6617><t6618>"</t6618>
<t6619>Fourteenth Hour</t6619>
<t6620>As soon as the initial shock of the incident passes, we start cleaning up the area.</t6620> <t6621>We try to sweep as much glass as possible from the broken Bluefin bottles onto pieces of paper and then collect everything into a single bag to dispose of later.</t6621> <t6622>The minivan's carpet is soaked with sticky Mountain Dew, Bluefin, and diet cola, and we attempt to dry it with a few napkins we've gathered.</t6622> <t6623>But we'll need to go to a car wash, and we don't have time for that before Agloe.</t6623> <t6624>Radar checked how much it would cost to replace the necessary side panel for the minivan: $300 plus paint.</t6624> <t6625>The cost of this trip keeps rising</t6625><t6626>.</t6626>
<t6627>but I will make up for it by working at my father's office this summer, and besides, it will be a small atonement for Margo.</t6627>
<t6628>The sun is rising from our right.</t6628> <t6629>My cheek is still burning.</t6629> <t6630>The Confederate flag is now stuck to the wound, so I no longer need to hold it there.</t6630>
<t6631>A sparse line of oak trees slightly conceals my cornfields stretching to the horizon.</t6631> <t6632>The scenery changes, but everything else remains the same.</t6632> <t6633>Highways like this turn the country into a single place: McDonald’s, BP, Wendy’s.</t6633> <t6634>I probably should hate this aspect of highways and long for the golden days of yore, when every corner was surrounded by local colors and such...</t6634> <t6635>but I don't care.</t6635> <t6636>I love it.</t6636> <t6637>I love the consistency.</t6637> <t6638>I love being able to travel fifteen hours from home without the world changing too much.</t6638> <t6639>Lacey straps me in the back with a double seatbelt.</t6639> <t6640>“You need to rest,” she says.</t6640> <t6641>“You've been through a lot.”</t6641> <t6642>It's amazing that no one has accused me of not being more cautious in the fight against the cow.</t6642>
<t6643>As I slowly drift away, I hear them making each other laugh.</t6643> <t6644>..</t6644> <t6645>Not exactly the words, but the rhythm, the rising and falling tones of their banter.</t6645> <t6646>I just love listening, just idling on the grass.</t6646> <t6647>And if we get there on time but can't find him, I've decided what we'll do: We'll drive around the Catskills, idling on the grass, talking, joking, finding a place to sit idly and hang out.</t6647> <t6648>Maybe the certainty of his being alive will make these things possible again...</t6648> <t6649>even if I don't see proof of his being alive.</t6649> <t6650>The happiness without him, the power to let him go,</t6650>
<t6651>Even if I never see the blade of grass again, I feel like I can imagine what it is like to feel that our roots are connected.</t6651>
<t6652>The Sixth Hour</t6652>
<t6653>I am sleeping.</t6653>
<t6654>The Seventh Hour</t6654>
<t6655>I am sleeping.</t6655>
<t6656>The Eighteenth Hour</t6656>
<t6657>I am sleeping.</t6657>
<t6658>The Ninth Hour</t6658>
<t6659>When I wake up, Radar and Ben are loudly arguing about the name of the car.</t6659> <t6660>Ben wants to name it Muhammad Ali because the minivan keeps going despite taking punches, just like Muhammad Ali.</t6660> <t6661>Radar says a car can't be named after a historical figure.</t6661> <t6662>He thinks the car should be named Lurlene because it sounds right.</t6662>
<t6663>“Do you want to name it Lurlene?” Ben asks, his voice rising in horror.</t6663> <t6664>“Hasn't this poor vehicle been through enough?!”</t6664> <t6665>I unbuckle one of the seat belts and sit up straight.</t6665> <t6666>Lacey turns to me.</t6666> <t6667>“Good morning,” she says.</t6667> <t6668>“Welcome to the great state of New York.” “What time is it?</t6668><t6669>”</t6669>
<t6670>"Nine forty-two."</t6670> <t6671>Her hair is tied in a ponytail, but shorter strands are loose.</t6671> <t6672>"How's it going?" she asks.</t6672>
<t6673>I am telling her.</t6673> <t6674>“I am scared.</t6674><t6675>”</t6675>
<t6676>Lacey smiles at me and nods her head.</t6676> <t6677>"Yes, me too.</t6677> <t6678>There seems to be too much for us to be prepared for everything.</t6678><t6679>"</t6679>
<t6680>“Yes,” I say.</t6680>
<t6681>“I hope we stay friends this summer,” he says.</t6681> <t6682>And somehow, it helps.</t6682> <t6683>You never know what will help.</t6683>
<t6684>Radar now says that the car's name should be Grey Goose.</t6684> <t6685>I lean forward a bit so that everyone can hear me.</t6685> <t6686>“Swivel.</t6686> <t6687>The harder you turn it, the better it works.</t6687><t6688>”</t6688>
<t6689>He nods his head in approval.</t6689> <t6690>Radar turns around.</t6690> <t6691>“I think you should be the official namer.</t6691><t6692>”</t6692>
<t6693>Twentieth Hour</t6693>
<t6694>I'm sitting with Lacey in the first bedroom.</t6694> <t6695>Ben is driving the car.</t6695> <t6696>Radar is browsing the internet.</t6696> <t6697>When they last stopped, I was sleeping, but they got a map of New York.</t6697> <t6698>Agloe is not marked, but there are only five or six intersections north of Roscoe.</t6698> <t6699>I always thought of New York as an expanding and endless metropolis, but here there are only lush, rolling hills that the minivan heroically struggles to climb.</t6699> <t6700>When the conversation gets a bit interrupted, Ben doesn't reach for the radio button; I say, "I See Metaphysics!"</t6700>
<t6701>I'm starting.</t6701> <t6702>"Right now, I see something around that I really like.</t6702><t6703>"</t6703>
<t6704>"Ah, I know well," says Radar.</t6704> <t6705>"The taste of testicles.</t6705><t6706>"</t6706>
<t6707>“No.</t6707><t6708>”</t6708>
<t6709>"The taste of penises?" I guess.</t6709>
<t6710>"No, idiot," says Ben.</t6710>
<t6711>“Hmm,” says Radar.</t6711> <t6712>“The smell of testicles?</t6712><t6713>”</t6713>
<t6714>"The texture of the testicles?" I guess.</t6714>
<t6715>“Come on, assholes, it has nothing to do with genitals.</t6715> <t6716>Lace?” “So, how does it feel knowing you saved three lives?</t6716><t6717>”</t6717>
<t6718>“No.</t6718> <t6719>And your guesses are exhausted.</t6719><t6720>”</t6720>
<t6721>‘Okay, what is it?</t6721><t6722>”</t6722>
<t6723>“Lacey,” he says, and I can see that he is looking at Lacey through the rearview mirror.</t6723>
<t6724>"Idiot," I say, "It should be Seeing Metaphysics.</t6724> <t6725>There have to be invisible things.</t6725><t6726>"</t6726>
<t6727>“And so it is,” he says.</t6727> <t6728>“This is really what I like...</t6728> <t6729>Lacey, but not the visible Lacey.</t6729><t6730>”</t6730>
<t6731>“Ah, you're bluffing,” says Radar, but Lacey unbuckles her seatbelt and leans forward over the kitchen to whisper something in his ear.</t6731> <t6732>In response, Ben blushes.</t6732>
<t6733>“Okay, I promise I won't fool around,” says Radar.</t6733> <t6734>“Right now, I see something that all of us are feeling.”</t6734> <t6735>“Extreme fatigue?” I guess.</t6735>
<t6736>“No, nevertheless, an excellent guess.</t6736><t6737>”</t6737>
<t6738>Lacey is speaking.</t6738> <t6739>“Is it something about that weird feeling you get from too much caffeine?</t6739> <t6740>You know, like when your heart feels like it's beating all over your body?</t6740><t6741>”</t6741>
<t6742>“No.</t6742> <t6743>Me?</t6743><t6744>”</t6744>
<t6745>“Eee, do we feel the need to pee, or is it just me who has a problem?</t6745><t6746>”</t6746>
<t6747>“As usual, only you have it.</t6747> <t6748>Any other guesses?” We remain silent.</t6748> <t6749>“The correct answer is that we all feel happier after our a cappella rendition of Blister in the Sun.</t6749><t6750>”</t6750>
<t6751>And it really is so.</t6751> <t6752>I may be tone-deaf, but I sing the song as loudly as everyone else.</t6752> <t6753>When we finish, I say, "I see a great story around right now."</t6753>
<t6754>For a while, no one says anything.</t6754> <t6755>There is only the sound of Fırdöndü devouring the asphalt road as it speeds downhill.</t6755> <t6756>After a while, Ben says, "This is the story, isn't it?"</t6756>
<t6757>I nod in agreement.</t6757>
<t6758>“Yes,” says Radar.</t6758> <t6759>“As long as we don't die, this will be a crazy story.</t6759><t6760>”</t6760>
<t6761>I think it would be helpful if we could find it, but I don't say anything.</t6761> <t6762>Finally, I turn on the radio and find a rock music station with songs we can sing along to.</t6762>
<t6763>Twenty-First Hour</t6763>
<t6764>After traveling more than one thousand eight hundred kilometers on interstate highways, it's finally time to exit.</t6764> <t6765>It's absolutely impossible for us to go one hundred twenty-four kilometers per hour on the two-lane highway that takes us further north to the Catskills.</t6765> <t6766>But it won't be a problem.</t6766> <t6767>Since Radar is the best tactician ever, he has allocated an extra thirty minutes without telling us.</t6767> <t6768>This place is very beautiful, the daylight at dawn is pouring over the untouched forests.</t6768> <t6769>Even the brick buildings in the desolate towns we pass by look well-maintained in this light.</t6769>
<t6770>In the hope of helping them find Margo, together with Lacey, we are telling Ben and Radar everything we can think of.</t6770> <t6771>We remind them of Margo.</t6771> <t6772>We remind ourselves of Margo.</t6772> <t6773>Her silver Honda Civic.</t6773> <t6774>Her chestnut, straight hair.</t6774> <t6775>Her fondness for abandoned buildings.</t6775>
<t6776>"He has a black notebook with him," I say.</t6776>
<t6777>Ben suddenly turns to me.</t6777> <t6778>‘Okay, Q.</t6778> <t6779>If I see a girl in Agloe, New York who looks exactly like Margo, I won’t do anything.</t6779> <t6780>Unless she has a notebook.</t6780> <t6781>That will be the giveaway.”</t6781> <t6782>I don’t pay attention to him.</t6782> <t6783>I just want to remember Margo.</t6783> <t6784>While I still hope to see her, I want to remember her one last time.</t6784>
<t6785>Agloe</t6785>
<t6786>The speed limit drops from ninety to seventy, then to fifty.</t6786> <t6787>We cross over the railroad tracks and we are in Roscoe.</t6787> <t6788>We slowly pass through the sleepy town center, which has a café, a clothing store, a discount shop, and a few boarded-up stores.</t6788>
<t6789>Leaning forward, I say, "I can imagine Margo there."</t6789>
<t6790>“Yes,” says Ben.</t6790> <t6791>“Buddy, I really don't want to break into buildings without permission.</t6791> <t6792>I don't think I'll do well in New York prisons.</t6792><t6793>”</t6793>
<t6794>Since the whole town looks deserted, the idea of exploring these buildings doesn't particularly scare me.</t6794> <t6795>Nothing is open here.</t6795> <t6796>After passing the center, a single road intersects the main road, and on this road, there is Roscoe's secluded neighborhood and an elementary school.</t6796> <t6797>Modest wooden houses appear tiny beside the wide and tall trees.</t6797>
<t6798>We turn onto another main road and the speed limit increases again, but Radar still drives slowly.</t6798> <t6799>When we see a dirt road on our left without a street sign to show us its name, we haven't even gone one and a half kilometers yet.</t6799>
<t6800>“This could be it,” I say.</t6800>
<t6801>"It's a driveway," Ben replies, but Radar turns anyway.</t6801> <t6802>However, it actually looks like a dirt driveway.</t6802> <t6803>To our left, the uncut grass is as tall as tires; I can't see anything, but on the other hand, I'm worried that it would be easy for someone to hide anywhere here.</t6803> <t6804>We go for a while</t6804>
<t6805>The road and journey end at a Victorian-style farmhouse.</t6805> <t6806>We turn back and head towards the two-lane highway further north again.</t6806> <t6807>The highway turns into Cat Hollow Road, and we go until we see a dirt road identical to the previous one, this time leading to a barn-like structure made of weathered wood on the right side of the street.</t6807> <t6808>In the meadows on both sides of us, large cylindrical hay bales are lined up, but the grass has started to grow again.</t6808> <t6809>Radar is not driving faster than eight kilometers per hour.</t6809> <t6810>We notice something unusual.</t6810> <t6811>A crack in the peaceful countryside scenery.</t6811>
<t6812>“Do you think this could be the Agloe Market?</t6812><t6813>”</t6813>
<t6814>“Is this the barn?</t6814><t6815>”</t6815>
<t6816>“Yes.</t6816><t6817>”</t6817>
<t6818>"I don't know," says Radar.</t6818> <t6819>"Would the markets look like barns?"</t6819> <t6820>I let out a long breath through my pursed lips.</t6820> <t6821>"I don't know.</t6821><t6822>"</t6822>
<t6823>“This...</t6823> <t6824>“Damn it, this is Margo’s car!” Lacey is shouting next to me.</t6824> <t6825>“Yes yes yes yes yes it’s her car it’s her car!” As I follow Lacey’s finger pointing to the other side of the field, behind the building, Radar stops the car.</t6825> <t6826>A silver glint.</t6826> <t6827>I bend down until my face is next to Lacey’s, and I can see the curve of the roof of the car.</t6827> <t6828>God knows how it got there, because no road leads in that direction.</t6828>
<t6829>Radar pulls over, I jump out and run towards Margo's car.</t6829> <t6830>Empty.</t6830> <t6831>Unlocked.</t6831> <t6832>I open the trunk.</t6832> <t6833>It is also empty, except for an open and empty suitcase.</t6833> <t6834>I look around and now move towards the structure I believe to be the remnants of the Agloe Market.</t6834> <t6835>As I run over the mowed grass, Ben and Radar pass me.</t6835> <t6836>We enter the barn not through a door, but through a gap in the wooden wall.</t6836>
<t6837>Inside the building, sunlight streams through numerous holes in the roof, illuminating the pieces of the decaying wooden floor.</t6837> <t6838>As I search for Margo, I start to perceive certain things: the soaking wet floor</t6838>
<t6839>the boards.</t6839> <t6840>The scent of almonds, like her.</t6840> <t6841>An old, claw-footed bathtub in a corner.</t6841> <t6842>What makes this place both an interior and exterior space at the same time are the numerous holes everywhere.</t6842>
<t6843>I feel someone tugging at my shirt roughly.</t6843> <t6844>I turn my head and see Ben, his eyes darting between a corner of the room and me.</t6844> <t6845>I have to look beyond a broad beam of bright white light streaming down from the ceiling, but I can see that corner.</t6845> <t6846>At chest height, two long, dirty, gray plexiglass sheets are leaning against each other at a narrow angle, while on the other side they rest against the wooden wall.</t6846> <t6847>It's a triangular-shaped nook, if such a thing is possible.</t6847>
<t6848>And here's the thing about dark-colored windows: The light still gets in.</t6848> <t6849>So despite being in shades of gray, I can see the shocking scene: Margo Roth Spiegelman, sitting in a black leather office chair, leaning over a school desk, writing.</t6849> <t6850>Her hair is much shorter, with wavy bangs over her eyebrows, and as if to emphasize the asymmetry, it's all messy—but this is Margo.</t6850> <t6851>Alive.</t6851> <t6852>She has moved her office from an abandoned shopping mall in Florida to an abandoned barn in New York, and I have found her.</t6852>
<t6853>We are walking towards Margo, all four of us at once, but she doesn't seem to notice us.</t6853> <t6854>She just keeps writing.</t6854> <t6855>Finally, someone—maybe Radar—says, "Margo.</t6855> <t6856>Margo?"</t6856>
<t6857>She stands on her tiptoes; her hands are at the top of the makeshift room's walls.</t6857> <t6858>Even if she's surprised to see us, her eyes don't give her away.</t6858> <t6859>Here is Margo Roth Spiegelman, a meter and a half away from me, her lips chapped and rough, no makeup, dirt under her nails, her eyes silent.</t6859> <t6860>I've never seen her eyes so lifeless, but maybe I've never seen her eyes before.</t6860> <t6861>She's looking at me.</t6861> <t6862>I'm sure she's looking at me, not at Lacey, Ben, or Radar.</t6862> <t6863>Since the dead eyes of Kobcrl Doyner watched me in Jefferson Park, I haven't felt like I've been watched for a long time.</t6863>
<t6864>For a long time, I stand there in silence, too scared to continue walking from their gaze.</t6864> <t6865>"I and this mystery, here we stand," writes Whitman.</t6865>
<t6866>Finally, Margo speaks: "Give me about five minutes."</t6866> <t6867>And then she sits back down and continues writing from where she left off.</t6867>
<t6868>I'm watching her write.</t6868> <t6869>Aside from being a bit messy, she looks just like she always does.</t6869> <t6870>I don't know why, but I always thought she would look different.</t6870> <t6871>I would be older.</t6871> <t6872>That when I finally saw her again, I would barely recognize her.</t6872> <t6873>But there she is, I'm watching her through the plexiglass, and she looks like Margo Roth Spiegelman, the girl I've known since I was two...</t6873> <t6874>the girl who was an idea I loved.</t6874>
<t6875>And only now, when she closes her notebook, puts it in the backpack next to her, stands up, and walks towards us, do I realize that the idea is not only wrong but also dangerous.</t6875> <t6876>How deceptive it is to believe that a person is more than just a person.</t6876>
<t6877>“Hey,” he says to Lacey with a smile.</t6877> <t6878>First, he hugs Lacey, then shakes Ben's hand, and then Radar's.</t6878> <t6879>Raising his eyebrows, he says, “Hi, Q,” and then hugs me quickly and softly.</t6879> <t6880>I want to stay like that.</t6880> <t6881>I want an event.</t6881> <t6882>I want her to sob against my chest, her tears flowing from her dusty cheeks onto my shirt.</t6882> <t6883>But she only hugs me quickly and sits down on the ground.</t6883> <t6884>Following me, Ben, Radar, and Lacey sit in a row opposite her, so we all face Margo.</t6884>
<t6885>"It's nice to see you," I say after a while, feeling as if I have broken a silent prayer.</t6885>
<t6886>She tosses her bangs to one side.</t6886> <t6887>Before speaking, she seems to be deciding exactly what to say.</t6887> <t6888>"I, um.</t6888> <t6889>Um.</t6889> <t6890>It's rare for me to be at a loss for words, isn't it?</t6890> <t6891>Lately</t6891>
<t6892>I didn't talk much with people.</t6892> <t6893>Umm.</t6893> <t6894>I guess we should start with the question, what the hell are you doing here.</t6894><t6895>”</t6895>
<t6896>“Margo,” says Lacey.</t6896> <t6897>“God, we were so worried.”</t6897> <t6898>“No need to worry,” Margo replies cheerfully, “I’m fine.”</t6898> <t6899>She raises both of her thumbs up.</t6899> <t6900>“Everything is fine.” “You could have called and let us know,” says Ben, his voice revealing disappointment.</t6900> <t6901>“You would have saved us from a disastrous road trip.”</t6901> <t6902>“In my experience, when you leave a place, it’s best to leave it, Bloody Ben.</t6902> <t6903>By the way, why are you wearing a dress?</t6903><t6904>”</t6904>
<t6905>Ben is blushing.</t6905> <t6906>“Don’t say that to him,” Lacey scolds.</t6906> <t6907>Margo gives Lacey a look.</t6907> <t6908>“Oh, God, are you hanging out with him?”</t6908> <t6909>Lacey says nothing.</t6909> <t6910>“Actually, you’re not hanging out with him,” Margo says.</t6910>
<t6911>“Actually, I'm kidding,” says Lacey.</t6911> <t6912>“And actually, he's a great person.</t6912> <t6913>And actually, you're a whore.</t6913> <t6914>And actually, I'm leaving.</t6914> <t6915>It was nice to see you again, Margo.</t6915> <t6916>Thanks for terrifying me, making me feel like crap for the last month of my last year at school, and then acting like a whore when we chased after you to make sure you were okay.</t6916> <t6917>It was really a pleasure knowing you.” “You too.</t6917> <t6918>I mean, how else would I have known how fat I was without you?”</t6918> <t6919>Lacey gets up and leaves with her steps pounding on the floor, making the worn-out flooring tremble.</t6919> <t6920>I follow her.</t6920> <t6921>I look that way and see that Radar has also stood up.</t6921>
<t6922>“I actually never knew you from the clues to the full extent,” he says.</t6922> <t6923>“I loved the clues more than I loved you.</t6923><t6924>”</t6924>
<t6925>Margo asks me, "What is he talking about?"</t6925> <t6926>Radar doesn't answer.</t6926> <t6927>He just leaves.</t6927>
<t6928>Of course, I should go too.</t6928> <t6929>They are my friends, definitely more friends than Margo.</t6929> <t6930>But I have questions.</t6930> <t6931>As Margo stands up and walks towards her cubicle, I start with the most obvious one.</t6931> <t6932>"Why are you acting like such a spoiled child?</t6932><t6933>"</t6933>
<t6934>Suddenly, he turns around, grabs my shirt with his hand, and yells in my face: "Where do you get the idea that you can just show up like this without informing Iliç?</t6934><t6935>!</t6935><t6936>"</t6936>
<t6937>“How could I have informed you when you had practically vanished from the face of the earth?!”</t6937> <t6938>I see you blinking your eyes and I know you have no answer to this, so I continue.</t6938> <t6939>I am very angry with her.</t6939> <t6940>For the thing...</t6940> <t6941>I don't know why.</t6941> <t6942>Because she wasn't the Margo I expected her to be.</t6942> <t6943>Because she wasn't the Margo I finally thought I had imagined correctly.</t6943> <t6944>“I was sure there was a good reason for not having contacted anyone after that night.</t6944> <t6945>And...</t6945> <t6946>Was this your good reason?</t6946> <t6947>Was it so you could live like a vagabond?</t6947><t6948>”</t6948>
<t6949>He leaves my t-shirt and pushes it aside.</t6949> <t6950>"Now who is the spoiled one?</t6950> <t6951>I left in the only way I could be left.</t6951> <t6952>You pull and throw away my life in an instant...</t6952> <t6953>like a band-aid.</t6953> <t6954>But after that, you become you, I become Lace, everyone becomes themselves, and I become myself.</t6954><t6955>"</t6955>
<t6956>“I just can't be myself, Margo, because I thought you were dead.</t6956> <t6957>For a very long time.</t6957> <t6958>That's why I had to do things I would never normally do.</t6958><t6959>”</t6959>
<t6960>Now she is screaming at me, rising on her toes by grabbing my shirt to reach my face.</t6960> <t6961>“Oh, don't be ridiculous.</t6961> <t6962>You didn't come here to make sure I was okay.</t6962> <t6963>You came here because you wanted to save poor little Margo from her troubled little self, so that I would be so grateful to my knight in shining armor that I would strip off my clothes and beg you to ravage my body.</t6963><t6964>”</t6964>
<t6965>“Stop talking nonsense!” I shout because, generally, he is talking nonsense.</t6965> <t6966>“You were just playing with us, weren't you?</t6966> <t6967>Even after you left to have fun, you wanted to make sure you were still the axis around which we revolved.</t6967><t6968>”</t6968>
<t6969>In response, she screams louder than I thought possible.</t6969> <t6970>"You're not even mad at me, Q! You're mad at the idea of me that you've kept in your head since we were kids!</t6970><t6971>"</t6971>
<t6972>She tries to turn away from me, but I grab her shoulders and hold her in front of me.</t6972> <t6973>“Have you ever thought about what your leaving means?</t6973> <t6974>For Ruthie?</t6974> <t6975>For me, for Lacey, or for the other people who care about you?</t6975> <t6976>No.</t6976> <t6977>Of course you haven't.</t6977> <t6978>Because if something doesn't happen to you, it doesn't really happen at all.</t6978> <t6979>Isn't that right, Margo?</t6979> <t6980>Isn't it?</t6980><t6981>”</t6981>
<t6982>He no longer fights with me.</t6982> <t6983>He just drops his shoulders, turns around, and walks back to his office.</t6983> <t6984>They kick and knock down the two Plexiglas walls, making noise as they hit the row and chair before sliding to the ground.</t6984> <t6985>"SHUT UP SHUT UP YOU ASSHOLE.</t6985><t6986>"</t6986>
<t6987>“Okay,” I say.</t6987> <t6988>Something about Margo completely losing her patience helps me regain mine.</t6988> <t6989>I try to talk like my mom.</t6989> <t6990>“I will shut up, we are both in a mess.</t6990> <t6991>From my perspective, there are a lot of unresolved issues.</t6991><t6992>”</t6992>
<t6993>He sits back down on the chair, his feet on the material that used to be the wall of his office.</t6993> <t6994>He examines a corner of the barn.</t6994> <t6995>There are at least three meters between us.</t6995> <t6996>"How did you find me?"</t6996><t6997></t6997>
<t6998>“I thought you wanted us to do it that way,” I replied.</t6998> <t6999>My voice is so low that I'm surprised he even hears me, but he turns his chair to glare at me.</t6999>
<t7000>“I am as sure as my name that I don't want it.</t7000><t7001>”</t7001>
<t7002>“My Own Song,” I say.</t7002> <t7003>“Guthrie took me to Whitman.</t7003> <t7004>Whitman took me to the door.</t7004> <t7005>The door took me to the shopping mall.</t7005> <t7006>We figured out how to read the overpainted graffiti.</t7006> <t7007>I didn’t understand the ‘paper towns’ thing; it can also mean neighborhoods that were never built, so I thought you went to one of them and never came back.</t7007> <t7008>I thought you died in one of these places, killed yourself, and for whatever reason, wanted me to find you.</t7008> <t7009>So I went to a few of them looking for you.</t7009> <t7010>But then, I compared the pinholes on the map from the gift shop.</t7010> <t7011>I started reading the poem more carefully, probably you didn’t run away</t7011>
<t7012>I understand, you had withdrawn to your corner just by making plans.</t7012> <t7013>By writing something in that notebook.</t7013> <t7014>I found Agloe on the map, saw your comment on the talk page of Omnictionary, skipped graduation, and drove here.</t7014><t7015>”</t7015>
<t7016>She combs her hair down, but it's no longer long enough to fall over her face.</t7016> <t7017>"I hate this haircut," she says.</t7017> <t7018>"I wanted to look different, but... it looks ridiculous.</t7018><t7019>"</t7019>
<t7020>“I liked it,” I say.</t7020> <t7021>“It frames your face nicely.</t7021><t7022>”</t7022>
<t7023>“I'm sorry, I was being very shrewish,” she says.</t7023> <t7024>“But you need to understand this...</t7024> <t7025>I mean, you come in so suddenly and scare me to death and...</t7025><t7026>”</t7026>
<t7027>“You could have just said: '(.</t7027><t7028>'Kids, you're scaring me to death.</t7028><t7029>”’</t7029>
<t7030>She purses her lips.</t7030> <t7031>“Yes, right, because everyone knows and loves Margo Roth Spiegelman.” Margo stays silent for a moment and then continues: “(hmıicl.</t7031> <t7032>I knew I shouldn't have said it in Omnictionary.</t7032> <t7033>I just thought it would be fun when they found it later.</t7033> <t7034>I thought the police might somehow track it, but not quickly enough.</t7034> <t7035>There are like a billion pages on Omnictionary.</t7035> <t7036>It never occurred to me...</t7036><t7037>”</t7037>
<t7038>“What?</t7038><t7039>”</t7039>
<t7040>“To answer the question, I thought about you a lot.</t7040> <t7041>And Ruthie.</t7041> <t7042>And my parents.</t7042> <t7043>Of course I thought about it, okay?</t7043> <t7044>Maybe I'm the most horribly selfish person in world history.</t7044> <t7045>But do you think I would have done this if I didn't need to?”</t7045> <t7046>He nods his head.</t7046> <t7047>Now, finally, he leans towards me, elbows on his knees, and we are talking.</t7047> <t7048>We are talking from a certain distance, but that's okay.</t7048> <t7049>“I couldn't think of another way to leave without being dragged back.</t7049><t7050>”</t7050>
<t7051>"I'm glad you're not dead," I say.</t7051>
<t7052>"Yes."</t7052> <t7053>"Me too," he says.</t7053> <t7054>He grins, and this is the first time I've seen that smile which I've missed for so long.</t7054> <t7055>"Having to leave</t7055>
<t7056>that's the reason.</t7056> <t7057>No matter how miserable life is, it is always better than the alternative.</t7057><t7058>”</t7058>
<t7059>My phone is ringing.</t7059> <t7060>It's me calling.</t7060> <t7061>I'm answering.</t7061>
<t7062>"Lacey, Margo wants to talk to you," he says to me.</t7062>
<t7063>I go over to Margo and hand her the phone, and while she sits with her hunched shoulders, I linger there, listening.</t7063> <t7064>I can hear the voices coming from the phone and then I hear Margo interrupting and saying, “Look, I’m really sorry.</t7064> <t7065>I was just so scared.”</t7065> <t7066>Then there is silence.</t7066> <t7067>Eventually, Lacey starts talking again, Margo laughs and says something.</t7067> <t7068>Feeling like they should have some privacy, I glance around a bit.</t7068> <t7069>Against the opposite wall from the office, in the far corner of the barn, Margo has set up some sort of bed...</t7069> <t7070>There are four-legged pallets under the orange inflatable mattress.</t7070> <t7071>Her small, neatly folded clothes are on another pallet next to the bed.</t7071> <t7072>There is a toothbrush and toothpaste, along with a plastic cup from Subway.</t7072> <t7073>These items are on top of two books: Sylvia Plath's The Bell Jar and Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five.</t7073> <t7074>Five.</t7074> <t7075>I can't believe she lives in this incongruous mix of orderly self and creepy decay.</t7075> <t7076>But on the other hand, I can't believe how much time I've spent believing she lived any other way.</t7076>
<t7077>“They are staying at a motel in the park.</t7077> <t7078>Lace told me to tell you that they will leave in the morning with or without you,” says Margo from behind me.</t7078> <t7079>When she said you instead of we, for the first time I start thinking about what will happen to me next.</t7079>
<t7080>“I mostly take care of myself,” he says, now standing next to me.</t7080> <t7081>“There is a toilet outside but it’s not in very good condition, so I usually go to the toilet at the truck stop east of Roscoe.</t7081> <t7082>There are also showers there, and the shower on the girls' side is quite clean because there aren't many female truckers.</t7082> <t7083>Moreover, there is internet.</t7083> <t7084>This is my home, and the truck stop is like my summer house.” I laugh.</t7084>
<t7085>He passes by me and kneels down to look at the shelves under the bed.</t7085> <t7086>He takes out a thin square piece of plastic with a flashlight.</t7086> <t7087>“These are the only things I bought all month besides gas and food.</t7087> <t7088>I only spent about three hundred dollars.”</t7088> <t7089>I take the square thing from him and finally realize it's a battery-operated music player.</t7089> <t7090>“I brought a few albums,” he says.</t7090> <t7091>“I'll get more in the city though.</t7091><t7092>”</t7092>
<t7093>“The city?</t7093><t7094>”</t7094>
<t7095>“Yes.</t7095> <t7096>Today I will set off for New York.</t7096> <t7097>The Omnictionary thing was because of that.</t7097> <t7098>I will really start traveling.</t7098> <t7099>Actually, I was planning to leave Orlando today...</t7099> <t7100>I was going to go to graduation, then do all those carefully prepared pranks with you on graduation night, and leave the next morning.</t7100> <t7101>But I couldn't bear it any longer.</t7101> <t7102>Seriously, I couldn't bear it for another hour.</t7102> <t7103>And when I heard Jase...</t7103> <t7104>I thought: ‘I planned everything; I'm just changing the day.’</t7104> <t7105>I'm sorry I scared you.</t7105> <t7106>I was trying not to scare you, but that last part was very rushed.</t7106> <t7107>Not my best work.</t7107><t7108>”</t7108>
<t7109>I had thought that the interwoven escape plans filled with clues were quite impressive.</t7109> <t7110>But more than that, I was surprised that he included me in his main plan.</t7110> <t7111>“Could you shed some light on the things I don't know?” I said, managing to smile.</t7111> <t7112>“I was curious...</t7112> <t7113>What was planned, what wasn't?</t7113> <t7114>What did everything mean?</t7114> <t7115>Why did the clues come to me, why did you leave, things like that.</t7115><t7116>”</t7116>
<t7117>“Hmm, okay.</t7117> <t7118>Okay.</t7118> <t7119>We need to start this story with another story.”</t7119> <t7120>He stands up, avoiding the rotten parts of the floor, and I follow his steps.</t7120> <t7121>He returns to his office, finds and takes out a black notebook from his backpack.</t7121> <t7122>Sitting cross-legged on the floor, he lightly taps the piece of wood next to him with his hand.</t7122> <t7123>I sit down.</t7123> <t7124>He gently touches the closed notebook.</t7124> <t7125>“Now this,” he says, “doesn't go back a long time.</t7125> <t7126>When I was in fourth grade, I started writing a story in this notebook.</t7126> <t7127>It was a kind of detective story.</t7127><t7128>”</t7128>
<t7129>If I take this notebook from him, I think I can use it for blackmail.</t7129> <t7130>I can use it to take him back to Orlando, find a job during the summer, live in an apartment until university starts, and at least spend the summer together.</t7130> <t7131>But I'm just listening.</t7131>
<t7132>‘I mean, I don't like to brag, but this is an unusually brilliant piece of literature.</t7132> <t7133>I'm kidding.</t7133> <t7134>The absurd ramblings of my ten-year-old self, who believed in magical things that fulfilled desires.</t7134> <t7135>The main character is a girl named Margo Roth Spiegelman, who in every way is just like my ten-year-old self, except her parents are good, rich, and can buy her anything she wants.</t7135> <t7136>Margo is smitten with a boy named Quentin, who in every way is just like you; completely fearless, brave, and willing to die and risk everything to protect me, except.</t7136> <t7137>Also starring is Myrna Mountweazel, who is exactly like Myrna Mountweazel, except for having magical powers.</t7137> <t7138>Like, for example, in the story, anyone who pets Myrna Mountweazel finds it impossible to lie for ten minutes.</t7138> <t7139>She can also talk.</t7139> <t7140>Of course she can talk.</t7140> <t7141>Could a ten-year-old have written a book about a dog that can't talk?”</t7141> <t7142>I'm laughing but still thinking about my ten-year-old self, who was smitten with ten-year-old Margo.</t7142>
<t7143>"So in the story," he continues, "Quentin, Margo, and Myrna Mountweazel are investigating the death of Robert Joyner, whose death, just like in real life, was by shooting himself in the head, except in the story, someone else shoots him in the head."</t7143> <t7144>"And the story is about us finding out who did it."</t7144><t7145>"</t7145>
<t7146>“Who did it?</t7146><t7147>”</t7147>
<t7148>He/She is laughing.</t7148> <t7149>“So, should I ruin the whole story?</t7149><t7150>”</t7150>
<t7151>"Actually," I say, "I prefer to read."</t7151> <t7152>She opens the notebook and shows me a page.</t7152> <t7153>The writing is unreadable, not because Margo's handwriting is bad, but because the horizontal lines of the text are</t7153>
<t7154>No, because it is also written vertically.</t7154> <t7155>"I write diagonally," he says.</t7155> <t7156>"It's very difficult to decipher for readers who are not Margoolmayan.</t7156> <t7157>That's why I will tell you the end of the story, but first you must promise not to get angry.</t7157><t7158>"</t7158>
<t7159>"Promise," I say.</t7159>
<t7160>“It turns out that the murder was committed by Robert Joyner's alcoholic ex-wife's brother, who had gone mad because he was possessed by the spirit of a demonic house cat from Ancient Egypt.</t7160> <t7161>As I said, an amazing narrative.</t7161> <t7162>But anyway, in the story, there's you, me, and Myma M0untwoa7.</t7162> <t7163>We go to confront the killer, and the guy tries to shoot me, but you heroically jump in front of the bullet and die in my arms.</t7163><t7164>”</t7164>
<t7165>I'm laughing.</t7165> <t7166>“Great.</t7166> <t7167>This story promised me a beautiful girl being struck, mystery, and intrigue, but right after that, I'm giving up my soul.</t7167><t7168>”</t7168>
<t7169>“Well, yes.” He smiles.</t7169> <t7170>“But I had to kill you because the only different possible ending was for the two of us to do that job, and when I was ten years old, I wasn't emotionally ready to write about it.</t7170><t7171>”</t7171>
<t7172>“Quite reasonable,” I say.</t7172> <t7173>“But when you review the article again, I want to take some action.</t7173><t7174>”</t7174>
<t7175>“It could be after being shot by the bad guy.</t7175> <t7176>For example, a kiss before dying.</t7176><t7177>”</t7177>
<t7178>"How thoughtful you are."</t7178> <t7179>I could stand up and go over to kiss him.</t7179> <t7180>I could do it.</t7180> <t7181>But there is still so much that can be ruined.</t7181>
<t7182>‘So anyway, I finished this story in fifth grade.</t7182> <t7183>A few years later, I decided I would run away to Mississippi.</t7183> <t7184>Then, I wrote all my plans for this epic event in this notebook, over the old story, and finally did it...</t7184> <t7185>I took my mom's car and drove a thousand six hundred kilometers and left clues in the soup with these letters.</t7185> <t7186>I didn't enjoy the journey, actually —I was incredibly lonely but I liked trying, okay?</t7186> <t7187>So I started writing more cross-plans...</t7187> <t7188>Pranks, ideas of setting certain girls up with certain guys, toilet paper attack campaigns, more secret trips, and whatever else.</t7188> <t7189>At the beginning of sophomore year, the notebook was half full and then, I decided I would do one more thing, one big thing, and then leave.</t7189><t7190>”</t7190>
<t7191>He is about to start talking again, but I have to stop him.</t7191> <t7192>"I think I'm wondering if the problem is the place or the people.</t7192> <t7193>Like, what would happen if the people around you were different?</t7193><t7194>"</t7194>
<t7195>“How can you separate these from each other? People are places, and places are people.</t7195> <t7196>Anyway, I thought there was no one else to be friends with.</t7196> <t7197>I thought everyone was either a coward like you or insensitive like Lacey.</t7197> <t7198>And...</t7198><t7199>”</t7199>
<t7200>“I'm not as cowardly as you think,” I say.</t7200> <t7201>Which is true.</t7201> <t7202>However, I realize it is true after I say it.</t7202> <t7203>But that's okay.</t7203>
<t7204>“I’m getting to that part,” he says, almost whining.</t7204> <t7205>“After all, when I was a freshman in high school, Gus took me to Osprey...”</t7205> <t7206>I lower my head in confusion.</t7206> <t7207>“The shopping mall.</t7207> <t7208>I started going there alone all the time, just hanging out and writing plans.</t7208> <t7209>In the last year, all the plans started to be about this final escape.</t7209> <t7210>I don’t know if it’s because I was reading my old story at the time, but I included you in the plans a long time ago.</t7210> <t7211>The idea in my mind was for us to do all these things together—like sneaking into SeaWorld without permission, which was also in the main plan—and for me to encourage you to be a tough kid.</t7211> <t7212>This one night would liberate you.</t7212> <t7213>Then I could disappear, and you would always remember me for this.</t7213>
<t7214>“In the end, this plan reached about seventy pages in length, then it came to the implementation stage and I thought it had really come together well.</t7214> <t7215>But I learned about Jase and just decided to go.</t7215> <t7216>Immediately.</t7216> <t7217>I didn't need to graduate.</t7217> <t7218>The purpose of graduating</t7218>
<t7219>What was it?</t7219> <t7220>But first, I had to tie up my unfinished business.</t7220> <t7221>Throughout that day at school, I held my notebook in my hand and tried to adapt the plan like crazy to Becca, Jase, Lacey, and basically everyone who wasn't my friend, trying to come up with ideas so that everyone would know how angry I was before I left them.</t7221>
<t7222>"But still, I wanted to do this with you; I liked the idea that I might still have the chance to create at least a reflection of the hero who kicked my ass in my childhood story, in you."</t7222>
<t7223>“But then you surprised me,” she says.</t7223> <t7224>“For so many years, you had been a paper boy to me...</t7224> <t7225>You were two-dimensional as a character on a page, and even though you were different as a person, you were still flat and two-dimensional.</t7225> <t7226>But that night, it turned out you were real.</t7226> <t7227>And the night ended so strangely, funnily, and magically that I returned to my room in the morning and missed you.</t7227> <t7228>I wanted to come by and hang out and talk, but since I had already decided to leave, I had to go.</t7228> <t7229>Then at the last second, the idea of leaving Osprey to you came to mind.</t7229> <t7230>The idea of leaving it to you so it could help you make more progress in the area of not being a complete coward.</t7230>
<t7231>‘Well, yes.</t7231> <t7232>That's all.</t7232> <t7233>I quickly found something.</t7233> <t7234>I taped the Woody poster behind the blinds, circled the song on the record, and underlined those two lines in My Own Song with a different pen than the one I usually use when I actually read.</t7234> <t7235>After you went to school, I climbed into your window and put the piece of newspaper on your door.</t7235> <t7236>Then that morning I went to Osprey, partly because I didn't feel ready to leave yet, partly because I wanted to clean it up for you.</t7236> <t7237>So the thing is, I didn't want you to worry.</t7237> <t7238>That's why I painted over the graffiti; I didn't know you could see through it.</t7238> <t7239>I tore out the pages of the desk calendar I was using and also took down the map because I saw Agloe on it.</t7239> <t7240>Then I slept there because I was tired and had nowhere else to go.</t7240> <t7241>In the end, I stayed there for two nights, I guess I was just trying to gather my courage.</t7241> <t7242>And also, I don't know, maybe</t7242>
<t7243>I thought you would somehow find it quickly.</t7243> <t7244>Then I went.</t7244> <t7245>It took me two days to get here.</t7245> <t7246>I've been here since then.</t7246><t7247>”</t7247>
<t7248>It seemed like he was done, but I had one more question.</t7248> <t7249>"Why here, out of all places?</t7249><t7250>"</t7250>
<t7251>“A paper town for a paper girl,” he says.</t7251> <t7252>“When I was ten or eleven, I read about Agloe in one of those ‘amazing facts’ books.</t7252> <t7253>And I never stopped thinking about it.</t7253> <t7254>The truth is, whenever I went up to the top of the SunTrust building—including the last time we went together—I didn’t think about how everything looked so paper-like.</t7254> <t7255>I looked down and thought about how paper-like I was.</t7255> <t7256>I was the fake, foldable person, not others.</t7256> <t7257>And the thing about it is: people love the idea of a paper girl.</t7257> <t7258>They always have.</t7258> <t7259>And the worst part is, I loved it too.</t7259> <t7260>I nurtured it, you understand?</t7260>
<t7261>“Because being an idea that everyone likes is nice.</t7261> <t7262>But for myself • I could never be that idea, not completely.</t7262> <t7263>And Agloe is a place where a paper creation turned into reality.</t7263> <t7264>A point on the map turned into a real place, more real than the creators of the point could have imagined.</t7264> <t7265>I thought maybe a girl cut from paper could start to become real here too.</t7265> <t7266>And it seemed like a way to tell that paper girl, who cares about popularity, clothes, and things like that, ‘You will go to the Paper Towns.</t7266> <t7267>And you will never return,’</t7267><t7268>”</t7268>
<t7269>"Graffiti," I say.</t7269> <t7270>"God, Margo, I wandered through many of those abandoned neighborhoods looking for your body.</t7270> <t7271>I really... really thought you were dead.</t7271><t7272>"</t7272>
<t7273>She stands up and rummages through her backpack for a short while, then lies down, takes The Bell Jar, and starts reading.</t7273> <t7274>"'But when it came right down to it, the skin of my wrist looked so white and defenseless that I couldn't do it.</t7274> <t7275>It was as if what I wanted to kill wasn't in that skin or the faint, blue pulse beating under my thumb, but somewhere else, deeper, more secret, and much harder to reach.</t7275>
<t7276>somewhere else.</t7276><t7277>”’ He sits down next to me again, close to me, across from me, without our knees actually touching, the fabric of our jeans touching.</t7277> <t7278>He speaks: “I understand what he's talking about.</t7278> <t7279>What the deeper and more secret thing is, like the cracks inside.</t7279> <t7280>As if there are these fault lines where things don't quite come together properly.</t7280><t7281>”</t7281>
<t7282>“I like this,” I say.</t7282> <t7283>“Or like the cracks on the hull of a ship.</t7283><t7284>”</t7284>
<t7285>“Right, right.</t7285><t7286>”</t7286>
<t7287>"In the end, it drags you down.</t7287><t7288>"</t7288>
<t7289>“Absolutely,” he says.</t7289> <t7290>Now we are talking very quickly.</t7290>
<t7291>“I can't believe you don't want me to find you.</t7291><t7292>”</t7292>
<t7293>“I'm sorry.</t7293> <t7294>If it will make you feel better, I am impressed.</t7294> <t7295>Also, it's nice to have you here.</t7295> <t7296>You are a good travel companion.</t7296><t7297>”</t7297>
<t7298>"Is this an offer?" I ask.</t7298>
<t7299>"Maybe." She smiles.</t7299>
<t7300>My heart has been fluttering inside my chest for so long that this level of intoxication almost feels like something that could be sustained... almost.</t7300> <t7301>"Margo, if you come home in the summer...</t7301> <t7302>My mom and dad said you could live with us, or you could find a job and an apartment for the summer, then school will start and you'll never have to live with your parents again.</t7302><t7303>"</t7303>
<t7304>“The problem is not just them.</t7304> <t7305>I immediately return to the same situation,” he says, “and I can never escape from it.</t7305> <t7306>The problem is not just gossip, parties, and all that nonsense, but all the allure of a life lived the right way...</t7306> <t7307>that is, university, job, husband, babies, and all that nonsense.</t7307><t7308>”</t7308>
<t7309>The thing is, I believe in university, jobs, and maybe even babies one day.</t7309> <t7310>I believe in the future.</t7310> <t7311>Maybe this is a personality disorder, but for me, it's something innate.</t7311> <t7312>"But university expands my opportunities," I say finally.</t7312> <t7313>"It doesn't limit them.</t7313><t7314>"</t7314>
<t7315>Smiling.</t7315> <t7316>"Thank you, Guidance Counselor Jacobsen," he says and then changes the subject.</t7316> <t7317>"I kept thinking about you in Osprey.</t7317> <t7318>Whether you would get used to this place.</t7318> <t7319>Whether you would stop worrying about the mice.</t7319><t7320>"</t7320>
<t7321>“I'm used to it,” I say.</t7321> <t7322>“I started to like it there.</t7322> <t7323>Actually, I spent the prom night there.</t7323><t7324>”</t7324>
<t7325>Smiling.</t7325> <t7326>“Amazing.</t7326> <t7327>I had imagined that you would eventually love it.</t7327> <t7328>It was never boring for me in Osprey, but that was because I had to go home at some point.</t7328> <t7329>I got bored when I came here.</t7329> <t7330>There is nothing to do; I have read a lot since I came here.</t7330> <t7331>Also, I became increasingly anxious here because I didn't know anyone.</t7331> <t7332>And I kept waiting for that loneliness and anxiety to make me want to go back.</t7332> <t7333>But it never happened.</t7333> <t7334>This is the one thing I can't do, Q.</t7334><t7335>”</t7335>
<t7336>I nod my head in agreement.</t7336> <t7337>I understand this.</t7337> <t7338>I can imagine that once you feel the continent in the palm of your hand, it is hard to go back.</t7338> <t7339>But still, I try once more.</t7339> <t7340>“But what will happen after summer?</t7340> <t7341>What will happen to university?</t7341> <t7342>What will happen to the rest of your life?</t7342><t7343>”</t7343>
<t7344>My shoulders shrug.</t7344> <t7345>“What happened?</t7345><t7346>”</t7346>
<t7347>“Well, aren't you worried about forever?</t7347><t7348>’</t7348>
<t7349>“Forever is composed of nows,” she says.</t7349> <t7350>I have no response to that; when Margo speaks again, I am still pondering her previous statement: “Emily Dickinson.</t7350> <t7351>As I said, I read a lot.</t7351><t7352>”</t7352>
<t7353>I believe the future deserves our faith.</t7353> <t7354>But it's hard to argue with Emily Dickinson.</t7354> <t7355>Margo stands up, slings her backpack over her shoulder, and extends her hand to me.</t7355> <t7356>"Come on, let's take a walk."</t7356> <t7357>As we head out, Margo asks for my phone.</t7357> <t7358>She dials a number with a firm press, and I start to walk away to give her privacy, but she grabs my arm and keeps me by her side.</t7358> <t7359>So, while she talks to her parents, I walk beside her towards the meadow outside.</t7359>
<t7360>“Hello, I'm Margo...</t7360> <t7361>I'm with Quentin in Agloe, New York...</t7361> <t7362>Ah...</t7362> <t7363>Well, no mom, I'm just trying to think of a way to answer your question honestly...</t7363> <t7364>Mom, don't...</t7364> <t7365>I don't know, mom...</t7365> <t7366>I had decided to move to an imaginary place.</t7366> <t7367>That's what happened...</t7367> <t7368>Yes, well, I don't think I'm heading that way, whatever happens...</t7368> <t7369>Can I talk to Ruthie?..</t7369> <t7370>Hello, my friend...</t7370> <t7371>No, I loved you first...</t7371> <t7372>Yes, I wish you well.</t7372> <t7373>This was a mistake.</t7373> <t7374>I thought that...</t7374> <t7375>I don't know what I was thinking, Ruthie, but whatever it was, it was a mistake and I will call you from now on.</t7375> <t7376>I might not call my mom, but I will call you...</t7376> <t7377>Is Wednesday okay?..</t7377> <t7378>You're busy on Wednesdays.</t7378> <t7379>Hmm.</t7379> <t7380>Okay.</t7380> <t7381>Which day works for you?..</t7381> <t7382>Alright then.</t7382> <t7383>Yes, every Tuesday...</t7383> <t7384>Yes, including this Tuesday.”</t7384> <t7385>Margo closes her eyes tightly, her teeth clenched.</t7385> <t7386>“Okay, Ruthers, can you give the phone back to my mom?..</t7386> <t7387>I love you, mom.</t7387> <t7388>I'm fine.</t7388> <t7389>I swear...</t7389> <t7390>Yes, okay, you too.</t7390> <t7391>Goodbye.</t7391><t7392>”</t7392>
<t7393>He stops walking and turns off the phone but holds it in his hand for about a minute.</t7393> <t7394>He grips it so tightly that I can see his fingertips turning pink, then he drops the phone to the ground.</t7394> <t7395>His scream is short but deafening, and then for the first time, I notice the miserable silence of Agloe.</t7395> <t7396>“It's as if he thinks my job is to please him and that this should be my most precious wish, and when I don't please him...</t7396> <t7397>I am thrown out.</t7397> <t7398>He changed the locks.</t7398> <t7399>That's the first thing he said.</t7399> <t7400>My God.</t7400><t7401>”</t7401>
<t7402>“I'm sorry,” I say, pushing aside the knee-high yellow-green grass to get the phone.</t7402> <t7403>“Was it good to talk to Ruthie?” “Yes, Ruthie is a lovely girl.</t7403> <t7404>Actually, I hate myself for not talking to her.</t7404><t7405>”</t7405>
<t7406>"Yes," I say.</t7406> <t7407>He nudges me as if joking.</t7407>
<t7408>“You need to make me feel better, not worse!” he says.</t7408> <t7409>“That's the whole point!</t7409><t7410>”</t7410>
<t7411>“I hadn't realized that my job was to please you, Ms. Spiegelman.</t7411><t7412>”</t7412>
<t7413>Laughing.</t7413> <t7414>“Oh, the mom comparison.</t7414> <t7415>Very bad.</t7415> <t7416>But you're right.</t7416> <t7417>So, how are you?</t7417> <t7418>If Ben is dating Lacey, you must be having sex parties with dozens of cheerleaders every night.</t7418><t7419>”</t7419>
<t7420>We are walking slowly on the rugged meadow.</t7420> <t7421>The meadow area does not look wide, but as we walk, I realize that it does not seem like we are getting closer to the distant grove.</t7421> <t7422>I am telling her about dropping out of graduation, the miraculous return of Fırdöndü.</t7422> <t7423>I talk about the prom, Lacey’s fight with Becca, and my night at Osprey5.</t7423> <t7424>“It was definitely the night I truly realized you were there,” I say.</t7424> <t7425>“That blanket still smelled like you.</t7425><t7426>”</t7426>
<t7427>When I say this, his hand lightly touches mine and I immediately grab his hand because it feels like there are fewer things left to ruin.</t7427> <t7428>He looks at me.</t7428> <t7429>“I had to go.</t7429> <t7430>I didn't need to scare you, it was foolish, and I should have done a better job when leaving, but I had to go.</t7430> <t7431>Do you understand now?</t7431><t7432>”</t7432>
<t7433>“Yes,” I say, “but I think you can come back now.</t7433> <t7434>I really think so.</t7434><t7435>”</t7435>
<t7436>“No, you are not thinking,” he replies, and he is right.</t7436> <t7437>He can read it from my face...</t7437> <t7438>I now understand that I cannot be him and he cannot be me.</t7438> <t7439>Maybe Whitman had a talent that I did not possess.</t7439> <t7440>But I must ask the wounded man where it hurts because I cannot be the wounded man.</t7440> <t7441>The only wounded man I can be is myself.</t7441>
<t7442>I sit down, crushing the grass under my feet.</t7442> <t7443>He lies down next to me, his backpack as a pillow.</t7443> <t7444>I also lie down on my back.</t7444> <t7445>He searches for a few books in his backpack and hands them to me so that I also have a pillow.</t7445> <t7446>Selected Poems by Emily Dickinson and Leaves of Grass, “there were two,” he says with a smile.</t7446>
<t7447>“A terribly good poem,” I say.</t7447> <t7448>“You couldn't have chosen a better one.”</t7448> <t7449>“Really? It was a sudden decision I made that morning.</t7449> <t7450>I remembered the small piece about doors and thought it was perfect.</t7450>
<t7451>But then when I came here, I read it again.</t7451> <t7452>I hadn't read it since literature class in the second year of high school, and yes, I liked it.</t7452> <t7453>I tried to read a lot of poetry.</t7453> <t7454>Well, that night I was trying to figure out what it was about you that surprised me.</t7454> <t7455>And for a long time, I thought it was when you quoted T.</t7455> <t7456>S.</t7456> <t7457>Eliot.</t7457><t7458>”</t7458>
<t7459>“But it wasn't,” I say.</t7459> <t7460>“You were surprised by the size of my biceps and the grace with which I exited through the window.</t7460><t7461>”</t7461>
<t7462>Grinning.</t7462> <t7463>"Shut up so I can compliment you, idiot.</t7463> <t7464>It wasn't the poetry or the muscles.</t7464> <t7465>What surprised me</t7465> <t7466>was that, despite anxiety attacks and all, you were as disciplined as Quentin in my story.</t7466> <t7467>I mean, for years now, I've been writing crosswise over that story, and whenever I write over it, I read that page, and always, well... no offense, but I would laugh and say, 'My God, I can't believe I thought of Quentin Jacobsen as the super sexy and super loyal protector of justice.'</t7467> <t7468>But then I realized that, in a way, you were.</t7468><t7469>"</t7469>
<t7470>I can turn sideways and so can he.</t7470> <t7471>And then we can kiss.</t7471> <t7472>But what's the point of kissing him now anyway?</t7472> <t7473>It won't lead anywhere.</t7473> <t7474>We are both watching the cloudless sky.</t7474> <t7475>"Nothing ever turns out the way you imagine," he says.</t7475>
<t7476>The sky is like a monochrome modern painting, with the illusion of depth pulling me upward, towards itself.</t7476> <t7477>“Yes, that's right,” I say.</t7477> <t7478>But after thinking for a second, I add: “But if you don't imagine, nothing will happen.”</t7478> <t7479>Imagining is not perfect.</t7479> <t7480>You can't fully enter into another person.</t7480> <t7481>I could never imagine Margo getting angry when found or the story she wrote.</t7481> <t7482>But imagining being another person or the world being something else is the only way in.</t7482> <t7483>This is the machine that kills fascists.</t7483>
<t7484>He turns to me, puts his hand on my shoulder, and we lie there just like that, as I had imagined us lying on the grass at SeaWorld a long time ago.</t7484> <t7485>It cost us thousands of kilometers and many days, but here we are: His head on my shoulder, his breath on my neck,</t7485>
<t7486>There is a fatigue deeply ingrained in both of us.</t7486> <t7487>Right now, we are just as I wished we were back then.</t7487>
<t7488>When I wake up, the dying light of the day makes everything seem important, from the yellowing sky to the blades of grass waving slowly above my head like a beauty queen.</t7488> <t7489>I turn to the side and see Margo Roth Spiegelman a few meters away from me, with her hands on her knees, her pants clinging to her legs.</t7489> <t7490>It takes me a short time to realize that I am digging the ground.</t7490> <t7491>I crawl towards her and start digging beside her, the soil beneath the grass as dry as the dust on my fingers.</t7491> <t7492>She smiles at me.</t7492> <t7493>My heart is beating at the speed of sound.</t7493>
<t7494>"Why are we digging?" I ask.</t7494>
<t7495>“That is not the right question,” he says.</t7495> <t7496>“The right question is, for whom are we digging.</t7496><t7497>”</t7497>
<t7498>“Alright then.</t7498> <t7499>Who are we digging for?</t7499><t7500>”</t7500>
<t7501>"We are digging graves for Little Margo, Little Quentin, Puppy Myma Mountweazel, and poor dead Robert Joyner," he says.</t7501>
<t7502>“I can't miss these funerals,” I say.</t7502> <t7503>The soil is clumpy and dry, like an abandoned ant nest, perforated with paths made by insects.</t7503> <t7504>We repeatedly dig our bare hands into the soil, and a small cloud of dust accompanies each handful of earth.</t7504> <t7505>We are digging a deep and wide hole.</t7505> <t7506>This grave must be neat.</t7506> <t7507>Soon, I find myself digging up to my elbows.</t7507> <t7508>When I wipe the sweat off my cheek, the sleeve of my t-shirt gets dusty.</t7508> <t7509>Margo's cheeks are turning red.</t7509> <t7510>I can smell her, and it smells just like that night at SeaWorld, right before we jumped into the moat.</t7510>
<t7511>"I had never thought of him as a real person," she says.</t7511>
<t7512>When she talks, I get a chance to take a break and sit down.</t7512> <t7513>"Who, Robert Joyner?"</t7513><t7514>"</t7514>
<t7515>He continues digging.</t7515> <t7516>“Yes.</t7516> <t7517>I mean, it was something that happened to me, do you understand?</t7517> <t7518>But before he took a small role in the drama of my life... he was the main character in the drama of his own life.”</t7518> <t7519>I had never thought of him as a real person either.</t7519> <t7520>As a man playing in the dirt like me.</t7520> <t7521>As a man who falls in love like me.</t7521> <t7522>As a man who had broken strings, who had never felt that his own grass blade root was connected to the meadow, a cracked man.</t7522> <t7523>Like me.</t7523> <t7524>“Yes," I say after a while, returning to digging.</t7524> <t7525>“For me, he was always a corpse.</t7525> <t7526>always a corpse.</t7526><t7527>”</t7527>
<t7528>“I wish we could have done something,” he says.</t7528> <t7529>“I wish we could have proven how brave we are.</t7529><t7530>”</t7530>
<t7531>“Yes,” I say.</t7531> <t7532>“It would be nice to tell him this, whatever happened, it didn't have to be the end of the world.</t7532><t7533>”</t7533>
<t7534>"Yes, although in the end something kills you.</t7534><t7535>"</t7535>
<t7536>I shrug my shoulders.</t7536> <t7537>"Yes, I know.</t7537> <t7538>I'm not saying everything is bearable.</t7538> <t7539>Just that everything except the last thing is bearable."</t7539> <t7540>I put my hand back into the soil, the soil here is much darker than at home.</t7540> <t7541>I throw a handful of soil behind us and sit back down.</t7541> <t7542>I feel like I'm on the verge of an idea and try to get into it by talking.</t7542> <t7543>In our long and story-filled relationship, I have never said so many words to Margo in succession, but here it is, my last game for her.</t7543>
<t7544>"When I thought about his death, let me confess, I didn't think as much as you said, I thought all the strings inside me broke.</t7544> <t7545>But there are thousands of ways to perceive this: Maybe the strings break, maybe our ships sink, or maybe we are grass...</t7545> <t7546>Our roots are so dependent on each other that as long as one is still alive, no one is dead.</t7546> <t7547>We are not short of metaphors, that's what I mean.</t7547> <t7548>But you have to be careful about which metaphor you choose because it's important.</t7548> <t7549>If you choose the strings, then you are imagining a world where they can break irreparably.</t7549> <t7550>If you choose the grass, we are all extremely mutually dependent on each other</t7550>
<t7551>You are saying that we are connected, so we can use these root systems not only to understand each other but also to become each other.</t7551> <t7552>Metaphors have hidden meanings.</t7552> <t7553>Do you understand what I mean?</t7553><t7554>”</t7554>
<t7555>He nods in agreement.</t7555>
<t7556>“I love ropes.</t7556> <t7557>I always have.</t7557> <t7558>Because that's how I feel.</t7558> <t7559>But I think ropes make pain seem more deadly than it is, we are not as fragile as the ropes make us believe.</t7559> <t7560>And I love grass too.</t7560> <t7561>Grass brought me to you, helped me imagine you as a real person.</t7561> <t7562>But we are not different sprouts of the same plant.</t7562> <t7563>I cannot be you.</t7563> <t7564>And you cannot be me.</t7564> <t7565>You can imagine someone else in a good way...</t7565> <t7566>but it will never be completely perfect, do you understand?</t7566>
<t7567>“Maybe, as you said before, we are all cracking open.</t7567> <t7568>It’s as if each of us starts out as a waterproof shell.</t7568> <t7569>And something happens...</t7569> <t7570>someone leaves us, doesn’t love us, doesn’t understand us, or we don’t understand them and we lose, we fail, and we hurt each other.</t7570> <t7571>And the shell starts to crack open in some places.</t7571> <t7572>So yes, once the shell cracks, the end becomes inevitable.</t7572> <t7573>Once rain starts to pour into the Osprey, it will never be repaired.</t7573> <t7574>But there is a lot of time between the moment the cracks start to open and the moment we shatter.</t7574> <t7575>And only then can we see each other because we see the outside through our own cracks and the inside of others through their cracks.</t7575> <t7576>When did we ever see each other face to face?</t7576> <t7577>Not until you saw inside my cracks and I saw inside yours.</t7577> <t7578>Before that, we were just looking at each other’s ideas, like looking at the blinds on your window without ever seeing inside.</t7578> <t7579>But once the shell cracks, light can come in.</t7579> <t7580>Light can go out.</t7580><t7581>”</t7581>
<t7582>She brings her fingers to her lips, as if she is concentrating or hiding her mouth from me or wanting to feel the words she is about to say.</t7582> <t7583>"There really is something about you," she says at last.</t7583> <t7584>She looks at me for a long time, my eyes and her eyes...</t7584> <t7585>there is nothing between them.</t7585> <t7586>There is nothing to gain by kissing her.</t7586> <t7587>But I no longer expect to gain anything.</t7587> <t7588>"There is something I have to do," I say, she nods faintly, as if she knows what it is, and I kiss her.</t7588>
<t7589>Our kiss ends when Margo speaks after a long time.</t7589> <t7590>"You can come to New York.</t7590> <t7591>It would be fun.</t7591> <t7592>Like kissing.</t7592><t7593>"</t7593>
<t7594>And I say, "There really is something about kissing."</t7594>
<t7595>He also says, "You are saying no."</t7595>
<t7596>“Margo, my whole life is there and I am not you, I...”</t7596> <t7597>But I can't say anything because she kisses me again and at the moment she kisses me, I absolutely understand that we are heading in different directions.</t7597> <t7598>She stands up and walks to where we slept, to the backpack.</t7598> <t7599>She takes out the notebook, walks back to the grave, and places the notebook there.</t7599>
<t7600>"I will miss you," he whispers, I don't know if he's talking to me or the notebook.</t7600> <t7601>When I speak, I don't know who I'm talking to either: "Me too.</t7601><t7602>"</t7602>
<t7603>“May God be with you, Robert Joyner,” I say, and throw a handful of soil onto the notebook.</t7603>
<t7604>“May God be with you, young and brave Quentin Jacobsen,” he says, and then he throws the soil in his hand.</t7604>
<t7605>“May God be with you, fearless Margo Roth Spiegelman of Orlando,” I say as I throw another handful of dirt.</t7605>
<t7606>"Oh, 'May God be with you, magical puppy Myma Mountvveazel,' he says as he pours another handful of soil.</t7606> <t7607>He pushes the soil onto the notebook, pressing and compacting it.</t7607> <t7608>Soon, the grass will grow.</t7608> <t7609>For us, the graves will have beautiful uncut hair.</t7609>
<t7610>As we walk back to Agloe Market, we clasp our hardened hands together.</t7610> <t7611>I'm helping Margo carry her belongings to her car...</t7611> <t7612>an armful of clothes, toiletries, and</t7612>
<t7613>chair.</t7613> <t7614>0 the value of the moment, instead of making the conversation easier, makes it even more difficult.</t7614>
<t7615>When saying goodbye becomes inevitable, we stop in the parking lot of a single-story motel.</t7615> <t7616>“I will get a cell phone and call you,” he says.</t7616> <t7617>“And I will send emails.</t7617> <t7618>And I will send mysterious messages to the talk page of Omnictionary.</t7618><t7619>”</t7619>
<t7620>I'm smiling.</t7620> <t7621>“I will send you an email when we get home,” I say, “and I will be expecting a reply.</t7621><t7622>”</t7622>
<t7623>“I promise to send it.</t7623> <t7624>And we will meet.</t7624> <t7625>We are not done seeing each other yet.</t7625><t7626>”</t7626>
<t7627>"At the end of summer, before school starts, I can meet you somewhere," I say.</t7627>
<t7628>“Yes,” he says.</t7628> <t7629>“Yes, this is a good idea.”</t7629> <t7630>Smiling, I nod my head.</t7630> <t7631>He turns his back and when I see his shoulders shaking, I wonder if any of what he said was true.</t7631> <t7632>He is crying.</t7632>
<t7633>“See you, and by the way, I will write to you,” I say.</t7633>
<t7634>"Yes," he says without turning around, his voice muffled.</t7634> <t7635>"I will write to you too.</t7635><t7636>"</t7636>
<t7637>The thing that prevents us from falling apart is saying these things.</t7637> <t7638>Maybe we can make these futures come true by imagining them, maybe we can't, but in any case, we must imagine them.</t7638> <t7639>Light seeps out and pours in.</t7639>
<t7640>Realizing that I have never been this far from home before, I am in this park area and the girl I love and cannot follow is right here.</t7640> <t7641>I hope that what is referred to as the hero's journey ends here because not following her is the most</t7641>
<t7642>hard thing.</t7642>
<t7643>I keep thinking that she will get into the car, but she doesn't; finally, when she turns to me, I see her tear-filled eyes.</t7643> <t7644>The physical space between us evaporates.</t7644> <t7645>For one last time, we reach for the broken strings.</t7645>
<t7646>I feel her hands on my back.</t7646> <t7647>While kissing her, the air is dark but I keep my eyes open, Margo too, so close that I can see her, even in this night at the parking lot outside Agloe, there are visible signs of that invisible light.</t7647> <t7648>After kissing, as we look at each other for a long time, our foreheads touch.</t7648> <t7649>In this darkness with cracks, I can see her almost perfectly.</t7649>
<t7650>I learned that he made paper towns in his third year of university during a trip, when I came across one of them.</t7650> <t7651>With my travel companion, we kept going back and forth on a desolate part of a highway in South Dakota, searching for the town that the map indicated existed...</t7651> <t7652>As far as I can remember, the name of the town was Holen.</t7652> <t7653>Finally, we pulled the car into a driveway and knocked on the door.</t7653> <t7654>The friendly woman who opened the door had been asked this question before.</t7654> <t7655>She explained that the town we were looking for existed only on the map.</t7655>
<t7656>The story of Agloe, New York, as outlined in this book, is generally accurate.</t7656> <t7657>Agloe was born as a paper town created to avoid copyright infringement.</t7657> <t7658>But then, people who had those old Esso maps kept looking for it, and someone made Agloe real by opening a store there.</t7658> <t7659>The cartography profession has changed a lot since Otto G.</t7659> <t7660>Lindberg and Ernest Alpers invented Agloe.</t7660> <t7661>But many cartographers still include paper towns as copyright traps in their maps, as my surprising experience in South Dakota proves.</t7661>
<t7662>The store named Agloe is no longer there.</t7662> <t7663>But if we put it back on our maps, I believe that someone will eventually reopen it.</t7663>
