<t0>PART I</t0>
<t1>The Connections</t1>
<t2>8</t2>
<t3>1.</t3>This is the translated text.
<t4>The longest day of my life started quite late.</t4> <t5>I woke up late, hummed for too long in the bathroom, and as a result, had to enjoy breakfast in my mom's minivan at 7:17 AM that Wednesday.</t5>
<t6>On regular days, I would hitch a ride with my closest buddy, Ben Starling, but that day Ben had already cruised to school on time, so I couldn't rely on him.</t6> <t7>"On time" for us meant thirty minutes before classes started, because the precious half-hour before the first bell was the highlight of our social schedule: gathering and chatting outside the side door of the gym and music room.</t7> <t8>Most of my friends played musical instruments, and most of my free time at school was spent within a few meters around the music room.</t8> <t9>But I didn't play any instruments at all, because I had a condition called tone-deafness, which is generally related to actual deafness.</t9> <t10>Today I would be twenty minutes late, which technically meant I would still arrive ten minutes before class started.</t10>
<t11>While driving, my mom asked me about school, exams, and the graduation prom.</t11>
<t12>"I never enjoy parties, Mom," I said as she turned a corner.</t12> <t13>Immediately, I skillfully tilted the cereal to balance with gravity.</t13> <t14>I've done this trick many times.</t14>
<t15>“Well, what's wrong with going with a friend, dear?”</t15> <t16>“Surely you can invite Cassie Hiney.”</t16> <t17>I would definitely invite Cassie Hiney, a truly nice, friendly, and stunningly beautiful girl, but unfortunately, she has an extremely sensitive last name[3].</t17>
<t18>“Not just because I don't like the party.</t18> <t19>I don't even like the people who like the party,” I tried to explain, though to be honest, it wasn't quite true.</t19> <t20>Ben was the one who was all excited and frantic about this party.</t20>
<t21>Mom turned into the school, and I held the nearly empty bowl tightly with both hands as we went over the speed bumps.</t21> <t22>I quickly glanced at the senior student parking lot.</t22> <t23>Margo Roth Spiegelman's silver Honda was parked in its usual spot.</t23> <t24>Mom pulled the car into a dead-end near the music room and kissed me on the cheek goodbye.</t24> <t25>I caught sight of Ben and a few other guys standing in a semicircle.</t25>
<t26>I went to where they were, and the semicircle immediately expanded to include me.</t26> <t27>They were talking about my ex-girlfriend, Suzie Chung, who played the cello and had clearly stirred up controversy by dating a baseball player named Taddy Mac.</t27> <t28>I don't even know if that's his real name.</t28> <t29>Anyway, Suzie had decided to go to the prom with Taddy Mac.</t29> <t30>Another victim.</t30>
<t31>"Hey man," Ben stood opposite me and called.</t31> <t32>He nodded as a signal and then left.</t32> <t33>I followed him out of the crowd, heading into the gym.</t33> <t34>A small, dark-skinned guy who had gone through puberty but never quite finished it in a grand way, Ben had been my best friend since fifth grade, when we both finally admitted that neither of us could find anyone else to be a close friend.</t34> <t35>However, he had tried very hard, and I liked that—most of the time.</t35>
<t36>“What's wrong, sir?” I asked.</t36> <t37>We were safe in the music room, the people around us talking enough to drown out our conversation.</t37>
<t38>“Radar is going to the prom,” Ben grumbled.</t38> <t39>Radar is our awesome comrade.</t39> <t40>He is called Radar because he looks exactly like a scrawny guy with thick glasses named Radar from the old TV series M*A*S*H, except 1.</t40> <t41>TV Radar isn't black, and 2. At some point after being nicknamed, our Radar grew about fifteen centimeters taller and started wearing contact lenses, so I think that 3.</t41> <t42>He no longer looks like the guy from M*A*S*H, but 4.</t42> <t43>With only three and a half weeks until graduation, we couldn't be bothered to give him a new name.</t43>
<t44>“That girl Angela?” I asked.</t44> <t45>Radar never reveals anything about his love life, but that doesn't stop us from gossiping about it.</t45>
<t46>Ben nodded, then said, "You know my grand plan, right? Bringing a naive girl to the party because only the naive ones are unaware of the legend of Ben the Awkward." I nodded.</t46>
<t47>“Tsk,” Ben continued, “this morning a cute little ninth-grade bunny came to ask if I was Ben Bỉ Bựa. I had to explain clearly that it was a kidney infection. The little girl giggled and ran away immediately.</t47> <t48>End of story.</t48><t49>”</t49>
<t50>Back in tenth grade, Ben had to be hospitalized due to a kidney infection, but Becca Arrington, Margo's best friend, sparked a rumor that the real reason Ben was urinating blood was because he had been masturbating excessively.</t50> <t51>Although medically unfounded, the rumors stuck to Ben ever since. "That's disgusting," I didn't know what else to say.</t51>
<t52>Ben started planning to hook up with a girl, but I was only half-listening, as my eyes wandered over the increasingly crowded hallway, and I saw Margo Roth Spiegelman.</t52> <t53>She was standing by her locker, next to her boyfriend, Jase.</t53> <t54>Margo was wearing a knee-length white skirt and a blue shirt with a print on it.</t54> <t55>I could see her collarbones.</t55> <t56>Margo was laughing hard about something—her shoulders hunched forward, her big eyes glistening at the corners, her mouth wide open.</t56> <t57>But it didn't seem like she was laughing at something Jase said, because she wasn't looking at Jase; she was looking across the hallway at another row of lockers.</t57> <t58>I followed her gaze and saw Becca Arrington clinging to a baseball player like she was an ornament and he was a Christmas tree.</t58> <t59>I smiled at Margo, even though I knew she didn't see me.</t59>
<t60>"Step on the gas and go ahead."</t60> <t61>"Ignore that guy Jase."</t61> <t62>"Oh my God, she’s really a sugar-coated bunny," Ben mumbled.</t62> <t63>Walking, but my eyes still glanced at her through the crowd, capturing in my mind moments that could make a series of photos titled The Perfect Beauty in Stillness, only for mere mortals to pass by.</t63> <t64>Getting closer, I thought maybe</t64>
<t65>Margo didn't smile at all.</t65> <t66>Maybe she was surprised or received a gift or something.</t66> <t67>It seemed like she couldn't close her mouth.</t67>
<t68>"Yeah," I absentmindedly answered Ben, but I wasn't really paying attention to what he was saying because I was trying to look at Margo as much as possible without being too obvious.</t68> <t69>It's not because Margo is pretty.</t69> <t70>She's stunningly beautiful, in the literal sense of the words.</t70> <t71>And then we were too far from her, with too many people walking back and forth between Margo and me, that I couldn't even get close enough to hear her voice, or to understand what interesting thing had surprised her so much.</t71> <t72>Ben nodded because he had seen me look at Margo like that a thousand times, to the point where he was too used to it.</t72>
<t73>“Yeah, she's hot, but not that hot.</t73> <t74>Do you know who is really hot?”</t74>
<t75>"Who?" I asked.</t75>
<t76>“Lacey,” Ben replied, Lacey is another close friend of Margo.</t76> <t77>“And your mom too.</t77> <t78>I saw your mom kiss you on the cheek this morning.</t78> <t79>Don’t blame me, I swear to God I thought: Oh man, I wish I were Q. And also, I wish my cheeks could grow some balls.”</t79> <t80>I elbowed him in the ribs, but I was still thinking about Margo, because she was the only legend living right next door to me.</t80> <t81>Margo Roth Spiegelman, that six-syllable name was often mentioned in full, accompanied by a bit of admiration.</t81> <t82>Margo Roth Spiegelman, the stories of her epic adventures could sweep through the school like a summer storm: for instance, the story of an old man living in a dilapidated house in Hot Coffee, Mississippi, who taught Margo to play the guitar.</t82> <t83>Margo Roth Spiegelman, the girl who traveled for three days with a circus—they thought she had a real talent for tightrope walking.</t83> <t84>Margo Roth Spiegelman, the girl who drank a cup of herbal tea with the band The Mallionaires backstage after a performance in St. Louis, while they drank whiskey.</t84> <t85>Margo Roth Spiegelman, the girl who got into that performance by telling the ticket checker that she was the bass guitarist's girlfriend.</t85> <t86>Didn't they recognize her?</t86> <t87>Come on man, seriously, I’m Margo Roth Spiegelman, now if you go inside and tell the bass guitarist to take one look at me, he’ll immediately tell you that I’m his girlfriend, or that he wants me to be his girlfriend.</t87> <t88>The ticket checker did just that, and the bassist said, “Yeah, that’s my girlfriend, let her in.” After that, the guy wanted to date Margo seriously, and she turned down the bassist of The Mallionaires.</t88>
<t89>Those stories, when retold, always end with the phrase "So there, can you believe it?"</t89> <t90>Usually, it's unbelievable, but those are always true stories.</t90>
<t91>We went to our personal lockers.</t91> <t92>Radar was leaning against Ben's locker, tapping away on a handheld calculator.</t92>
<t93>“So you will be attending the prom,” I said to him.</t93> <t94>Radar looked up and then immediately looked down.</t94>
<t95>“I am correcting an article in the Encyclopedia of Everything about the former Prime Minister of France. Last night, some rascal deleted the entire article and inserted the sentence that Jacques Chirac is homosexual, which is incorrect both factually and grammatically.”</t95> <t96>Radar is a top-notch editor of an online reference site founded by the online community, fully named the Encyclopedia of Everything. His whole life, he has been dedicated to maintaining and developing this Encyclopedia.</t96> <t97>This is one of the reasons why it is so surprising that he is going on a date to a gala.</t97>
<t98>“So you will be attending the graduation ball, right,” I reiterated.</t98>
<t99>“Sorry,” he said without bothering to look up.</t99> <t100>Everyone knows I dread the prom.</t100> <t101>Absolutely nothing about that prom appeals to me—slow dancing, fast dancing, fancy dresses, rented tuxedos, nothing at all.</t101> <t102>Renting a tuxedo, to me, is the perfect way to catch some horrible disease from whoever wore that suit before, and I have no desire to be the only pure guy in the world covered in a swarm of lice.</t102>
<t103>"Hey man," Ben said to Radar, "the little bunnies already know all about Ben the Jerk." Finally, Radar put away his handheld device, nodding sympathetically and understandingly.</t103> <t104>"Anyway," Ben continued, "my two remaining strategies are to advertise on the Internet for a prom date, or fly to Missouri to kidnap some cute, obedient, dumb bunny."</t104> <t105>I had tried to tell Ben that "bunny" sounded too sexist and weak, lacking any personality, but he still wouldn't change his habit.</t105> <t106>He even called his own mother a bunny.</t106> <t107>This guy is truly hopeless.</t107>
<t108>“I will ask Angela if she knows anyone,” Radar said.</t108> <t109>“But getting a girl to go to the prom with you is harder than turning lead into gold.</t109><t110>”</t110>
<t111>“Getting a girl to agree to go to the dance with you is so tough that just the hypothesis alone is enough to cut diamonds,” I added.</t111>
<t112>Radar lightly punched the locker twice to show his approval and continued to the conclusion.</t112> <t113>"Ben, getting a girl to agree to go to the prom with you is so challenging that the United States government believes the issue cannot be resolved through diplomacy and must resort to force."</t113>
<t114>I was still thinking about the next part when all three of us saw the muscle-building hormone container shaped like a human named Chuck Parson angrily approaching us.</t114> <t115>Chuck Parson didn't play on any sports team because it would distract him from his life's grand goal: to one day be convicted of murder.</t115> <t116>"Hey, you fags," he called.</t116>
<t117>"Hello Chuck," I replied, trying to be as conciliatory as possible.</t117> <t118>In recent years, Chuck hasn't had any serious conflicts with us—some of the more influential members had declared that this meant we were safe.</t118> <t119>So when Chuck himself started a conversation with us, it seemed a bit strange.</t119>
<t120>Maybe it was because I opened my mouth, or maybe not, but Chuck slammed both fists onto the locker doors, pinning me in between, his face so close that I could easily guess which toothpaste he used.</t120> <t121>"What do you know about Margo and Jase?"</t121>
<t122>“Uh,” I replied, thinking about everything I knew about those two: Jase was Margo Roth Spiegelman's first and only serious boyfriend.</t122> <t123>They started dating late last year.</t123> <t124>Next year, they will both be going to the University of Florida.</t124> <t125>Jase got a scholarship because he will be playing on the school's baseball team.</t125> <t126>He never stayed long in her house, except when picking up Margo.</t126> <t127>She never seemed to like him that much, but she never seemed to like anyone that much.</t127> <t128>“Don’t know anything,” I finally said.</t128>
<t129>“Don't even think about deceiving me,” Chuck roared.</t129>
<t130>“I hardly understand anything about Margo,” I said, and it was true.</t130>
<t131>It considered my answer for a moment, while I tried my best to look straight into its closely set eyes.</t131> <t132>Chuck nodded very slightly, left the row of lockers, and went to his first-period class: Chest Care and Nutrition.</t132> <t133>The second bell rang.</t133> <t134>One minute left before class starts.</t134> <t135>Radar and I had calculus, while Ben had combinatorial mathematics.</t135> <t136>The classrooms were right next to each other, we walked in, the three of us in a row, believing our friends would make enough space for us to pass, and they did.</t136>
<t137>I said:</t137>
<t138>“Getting a girl to agree to go to the prom with you is so unlikely that a thousand monkeys typing on a thousand typewriters for a thousand years would not once type the sentence 'I will go to the prom with Ben.'”</t138>
<t139>Ben couldn't help but break down.</t139> <t140>“The prospect of me going to the prom is so pathetic that even Q's grandmother wouldn't go with me.</t140> <t141>She said she's waiting for Radar to ask her out.</t141><t142>”</t142>
<t143>Radar slowly nodded. "That's right, Q. Your grandma likes her comrades."</t143>
<t144>It was so easy to forget Chuck, to eagerly discuss the ball even though I didn't care about it at all.</t144>
<t145>The events of that morning: nothing was really too important, neither the good nor the bad.</t145> <t146>We were only busy entertaining each other, and we were leisurely generous in a very rightful way.</t146>
<t147>The next three hours I spent in class, trying not to look up at the clocks hanging on the blackboards, then looking at the clock, then panicking when I realized only a few minutes had passed since the last time I checked the time.</t147> <t148>I had nearly four years of experience watching the clock, but that snail's pace had never ceased to amaze me.</t148> <t149>If I were to live just one more day, I would rush to the endless corridors of Winter Park school, where everyone knows a day feels like a thousand years.</t149>
<t150>Or as long as the physics class in the third period that seemed like it would never end, but eventually it did, and then I went to the canteen with Ben. Radar had lunch during the fifth period with most of the others, so generally, Ben and I sat alone next to each other, with a couple sitting between us and a group from the drama team that we knew.</t150> <t151>Today, both of us had spicy sausage pizza.</t151>
<t152>“The pizza is delicious,” I said.</t152> <t153>Ben nodded absentmindedly.</t153> <t154>“What's wrong?” I asked.</t154>
<t155>"Crazy old man," Ben replied with a mouth full of cake.</t155> <t156>He swallowed hard.</t156> <t157>"I know you think this is ridiculous, but I want to go to the prom.</t157><t158>"</t158>
<t159>“1.</t159> <t160>Indeed, I find this game ridiculous; 2.</t160> <t161>If you like it, go ahead; 3.</t161> <t162>If I'm not mistaken, you haven't invited anyone yet.”</t162>
<t163>“During math class, I asked Cassie Hiney.</t163> <t164>I wrote a proper note.” I rolled my eyes skeptically.</t164> <t165>Ben reached into his pocket and pulled out a thickly folded piece of paper and handed it to me.</t165> <t166>I unfolded the paper:</t166>
<t167>Ben,</t167>
<t168>I also want to go to the prom with you, but I already agreed to go with Frank.</t168> <t169>Sorry!</t169>
<t170>–C</t170>
<t171>I folded the paper and slid it back across the table.</t171> <t172>I still remember playing paper football on tables like these.</t172> <t173>"So boring," I said.</t173>
<t174>“Yeah, it's not boring at all.”</t174> <t175>The walls of sound seemed to close in around us, the two of us sat in silence for a moment, then Ben looked at me seriously and said, “When I get to college, I'm going to turn the place upside down.</t175> <t176>I'll be recorded in the Guinness Book of World Records under the category 'Person who can charm the most bunnies.'</t176><t177>”</t177>
<t178>I burst out laughing.</t178> <t179>While still lost in thoughts about how Radar's parents actually got into the Guinness Book, I suddenly noticed a very pretty African-American girl with playful curls standing in front of me.</t179> <t180>It took me a moment to realize that it was Angela, who I guessed was Radar's girlfriend.</t180>
<t181>"Hello," she said to me.</t181>
<t182>"Hello," I replied.</t182> <t183>I had been in the same class as Angela, so I knew her a little, but we had never greeted each other in the hallway or anything like that.</t183> <t184>I moved aside to make room for Angela to sit.</t184> <t185>She squeezed past the chair and sat down at the head of the table.</t185>
<t186>“It seems like you guys understand Marcus the best,” Angela began, using Radar's real name.</t186> <t187>She leaned towards us, her elbows resting on the table.</t187>
<t188>“A boring mission, but someone has to take the hit,” Ben replied, grinning.</t188>
<t189>“Do you guys think he, um, is embarrassed because of me?” Ben burst out laughing.</t189> <t190>“What? No way,” he said.</t190>
<t191>"Actually," I added, "it's you who should be ashamed of him."</t191>
<t192>She widened her eyes and blinked, then smiled.</t192> <t193>A girl who is used to being praised.</t193> <t194>"But anyway, he has never, how should I put it, invited me to hang out with you guys."</t194>
<t195>“Ohhh...,” I finally understood the issue. “He’s embarrassed because of us, isn’t he?”</t195>
<t196>Angela burst out laughing.</t196> <t197>"You guys aren't weird at all."</t197>
<t198>“You haven't witnessed Ben snorting Sprite through his nose and then spitting it out through his mouth,” I said.</t198>
<t199>“At that moment, I looked like a carbonated fountain in a fit of rage,” Ben said nonchalantly.</t199>
<t200>“But if it were you guys, would you be worried?</t200> <t201>We’ve been dating for five weeks and he’s never taken me to his house.” Ben and I exchanged a knowing glance, my face contorting as I tried to suppress my laughter.</t201> <t202>“What’s wrong?” Angela asked.</t202>
<t203>“No problem,” I replied.</t203> <t204>“I'm serious, Angela, if he makes you hang out with us and takes you to his house all the time...”</t204>
<t205>“So, in short, he doesn't like you at all,” Ben concluded.</t205>
<t206>“Are his parents weird</t206><t207>?”</t207>
<t208>I struggled to find a way to answer that question honestly.</t208> <t209>"Um, not really.</t209> <t210>They're pretty cool.</t210> <t211>But I think they spoil him a bit too much."</t211>
<t212>“Well, you're a bit meticulous,” Ben agreed immediately, a bit too quickly.</t212>
<t213>Angela smiled and stood up, saying she had to go find someone before lunchtime was over.</t213> <t214>Ben waited until she was out of sight before exclaiming, "What a girl!"</t214>
<t215>"What else could it be," I said.</t215> <t216>"Or how about you and I ditch Radar to hang out with this girl instead."</t216>
<t217>“But she probably isn't as much of a computer whiz as Radar.</t217> <t218>We need someone good with computers, man.</t218> <t219>Plus, I bet she's pretty clueless at Resurrection,” which is the video game we're all addicted to.</t219> <t220>“By the way,” Ben added, “it sounds funny when you say Radar's parents spoil him a bit too much.”</t220>
<t221>“Well, how could I possibly blab anything,” I said.</t221>
<t222>“I wonder when Angela will get to visit the Radar House Museum Mansion,” Ben grinned mischievously.</t222>
<t223>Lunch break was almost over, Ben and I stood up and placed our lunch trays on the conveyor belt.</t223> <t224>The very same conveyor belt that Chuck Parson had once thrown me onto when I was new and clueless at school, tossing me down into the terrifying underworld of the Winter Park dishwashing crew.</t224> <t225>We went to Radar's locker and were still standing there when he zipped over after the first bell.</t225>
<t226>“During the state and government class, I decided that if I had to lick a donkey's balls to be exempted from that subject for the rest of the semester, I would willingly and voluntarily do so,” Radar muttered.</t226>
<t227>“Well, a donkey's balls can teach you a lot about the state and government,” I said.</t227> <t228>“By the way, speaking of reasons you might wish you had lunch during the fourth period, we just had lunch with Angela.”</t228>
<t229>Ben smirked at Radar and said, "Yeah, she wonders why she never gets to come to your house."</t229>
<t230>Radar let out a long, drawn-out sigh while tossing a bunch of random stuff into the locker.</t230> <t231>He sighed so long that I thought he would pass out from lack of breath.</t231>
<t232>“It's too bad,” it finally said.</t232>
<t233>“Are you embarrassed about something?” I asked with a smile.</t233>
<t234>“Turn it off now,” Radar grumbled, elbowing me in the stomach. “Your house is so beautiful,” I persisted.</t234>
<t235>“I'm serious with you,” Ben added.</t235> <t236>“Angela is really nice.</t236> <t237>I don't understand why you don't let her meet your parents and take a tour of Casa Radar.”</t237>
<t238>Radar threw the book into the drawer and closed it.</t238> <t239>The lively conversation around us died down when Radar looked straight up at the sky and shouted, “IT'S NOT MY FAULT THAT MY PARENTS HAVE THE WORLD'S LARGEST COLLECTION OF BLACK SANTA CLAUSES!”</t239>
<t240>I have heard Radar groan about “the world's largest collection of Black Santas” thousands of times in my life, and I have never been able to stifle a laugh because of it.</t240> <t241>But Radar wasn’t joking.</t241> <t242>I still remember the first time I went to his house.</t242> <t243>I think I was thirteen then.</t243> <t244>It was spring, several months after Christmas, yet there were still countless Black Santas hanging on the window sills.</t244> <t245>Paper Black Santas were hanging along the stair railings.</t245> <t246>Black Santa-shaped candles were decorating the dining table.</t246> <t247>An oil painting of a Black Santa hung above the fireplace, and on the mantelpiece was a series of Black Santa figurines.</t247> <t248>In the house, there was a candy jar shaped like a Black Santa bought from Namibia.</t248> <t249>A Black Santa lamp, usually placed next to the mailbox in the front yard from Thanksgiving to New Year, stood proudly in the corner of the spare bathroom at other times of the year, a bathroom with homemade wallpaper featuring Black Santa motifs and a Black Santa-shaped loofah.</t249> <t250>In every room, except Radar's room, the kingdom of Black Santas expanded everywhere—on plaster, plastic, marble, clay, wood, and fabric.</t250> <t251>In total, Radar’s parents owned over twelve hundred Black Santas in every form imaginable.</t251> <t252>As solemnly written on a small plaque next to the front door, Radar's house was a Santa Claus monument officially recognized by the Christmas Association.</t252>
<t253>“You just need to talk to Angela,” I said.</t253> <t254>“Something like, ‘Angela, I really like you, but there’s something you need to know: when we’re at my house and close together, we’ll be watched by two thousand four hundred eyes of one thousand two hundred black Santas.</t254><t255>’”</t255>
<t256>Radar scratched his crew-cut head, shaking it.</t256> <t257>"Yeah, I didn't think I would say exactly that, but I'll handle it."</t257>
<t258>I attended the class on state and government, while Ben took an elective course on video game design.</t258> <t259>I kept glancing at the clock throughout the next two periods, and finally, a sigh of relief escaped my chest when the class ended—the last part of the day always felt like a marathon with less than a month left until graduation.</t259>
<t260>I went home.</t260> <t261>Ate two pieces of bread with peanut butter and jam as a snack.</t261> <t262>Watched poker on TV.</t262> <t263>My parents came home at six o'clock, hugged each other and hugged me.</t263> <t264>A proper dinner with baked pasta.</t264> <t265>My parents asked me about school.</t265> <t266>About the graduation prom.</t266> <t267>My parents marveled that raising me was an achievement of theirs.</t267> <t268>That in their daily work they have to deal with people who grew up with less attentive care.</t268> <t269>My parents went to watch TV.</t269> <t270>I went to my room to check emails.</t270> <t271>I wrote a bit about The Great Gatsby for English class.</t271> <t272>I read a bit of The Federalist Papers, preparing for the government and politics exam.</t272> <t273>I chatted online with Ben, and after a while Radar also came online.</t273> <t274>During the conversation, he mentioned "the world's largest collection of black Santas" four times, each time making me chuckle.</t274> <t275>I told him that I was very happy he had a girlfriend.</t275> <t276>He said this summer would be fun.</t276> <t277>I agreed. Today is the fifth of May, but it doesn't really matter.</t277> <t278>My days are pleasantly similar.</t278> <t279>I always liked it that way: a regular routine.</t279> <t280>I liked the feeling of slight boredom.</t280> <t281>I didn't want to like it, but I did.</t281> <t282>And so the fifth of May could be any day—until just before midnight that night, when Margo Roth Spiegelman slid open the screenless window of my room, for the first time since she told me to close it nine years ago.</t282>
<t283>2.</t283>
<t284>I turned around when I heard the door open, and Margo's blue eyes were intently looking at me.</t284> <t285>At first, her eyes were all I could see, but as my vision adjusted, I realized Margo had blackened her face and was wearing a black hooded coat.</t285> <t286>"Are you flirting online?" she asked me.</t286>
<t287>“I'm chatting with Ben Starling.”</t287>
<t288>“That doesn't answer my question, you old goat.”</t288>
<t289>I smiled wryly, then walked to the window and knelt down, my face just a few inches from hers.</t289> <t290>I couldn't understand why she was here, by my window, like this.</t290> <t291>"Why do I have this honor?" I asked.</t291> <t292>Margo and I were still friends, I thought, but not the kind of friends who meet-in-the-middle-of-the-night-with-blackened-faces.</t292> <t293>I was sure she had friends for this kind of situation.</t293> <t294>And I was not one of those friends.</t294>
<t295>“I need your car,” Margo explained.</t295>
<t296>“I don't have a car,” I said, a confession that was somewhat painful for me.</t296>
<t297>"Well, I need your mom's car."</t297>
<t298>“You have your own car,” I repeated.</t298>
<t299>Margo sighed deeply.</t299> <t300>"Yes, but the problem is that my parents keep my car keys in a safe, under the bed, and Myrna Mountweazel"—Margo's dog—"sleeps in their room.</t300> <t301>And Myrna Mountweazel has a fit every time she sees me.</t301> <t302>I mean, I could totally sneak into the room, grab the safe, break it open to get the car keys, and drive away, but the problem is that there's no point in trying because as soon as I open the door, Myrna Mountweazel will start barking like crazy.</t302> <t303>So, like I said, I need a car.</t303> <t304>I also need you to drive because tonight I have eleven things to do, and at least the first five require an accomplice to break me out."</t304>
<t305>When I didn't focus my gaze anywhere, Margo seemed to dissolve and float in the air, leaving only her eyes.</t305> <t306>But when I focused on her, I could see the outline of her face, the black color still wet on Margo's skin.</t306> <t307>Her cheekbones and chin formed a triangle, and her dark lips faintly curved into a smile.</t307> <t308>"Is there any robbery, murder, or rape?" I asked.</t308>
<t309>"Hmm," Margo replied.</t309> <t310>"Remind me if breaking and entering is considered robbery, murder, or rape.</t310><t311>"</t311>
<t312>“No,” I replied succinctly.</t312>
<t313>“If it's not considered robbery, murder, or rape, will you not help me?”</t313>
<t314>“No, I can't help you.</t314> <t315>Can't you find a junior to take you?” Lacey and/or Becca always obediently followed Margo.</t315>
<t316>“Actually, they are part of the problem,” Margo said.</t316>
<t317>“What’s the matter?” I asked.</t317>
<t318>“There are eleven issues in total,” she said, looking impatient.</t318>
<t319>“No burning houses, killing people, or forcing innocent girls,” I stipulated.</t319>
<t320>“I swear to God that you will not commit such a grave sin.”</t320>
<t321>And at that very moment, Margo's house suddenly lit up brightly.</t321> <t322>Quick as a flash, she somersaulted through the window into my room, rolling under the bed.</t322> <t323>A split second later, Margo's dad was yelling from the back porch. "Margo! I see you!"</t323>
<t324>I heard a groaning sound from under the bed, "Oh my God!" Margo crawled out from under the bed, stood up, went to the window, and said, "Dad, I was just talking to Quentin."</t324> <t325>"You always say he has a positive influence on me."</t325>
<t326>"Just talking to Quentin?"</t326>
<t327>“Yes.”</t327>
<t328>“Why do you have to paint your face so black like that?”</t328>
<t329>Margo was momentarily startled for a very brief second.</t329> <t330>“Explaining everything in detail would take a long time, you must be tired now, so go to sl...</t330><t331>”</t331>
<t332>“Go home immediately,” Margo's dad roared. “Right now!”</t332>
<t333>Margo tugged at my sleeve, whispered "I'll be back in a minute" into my ear, then climbed out the window.</t333>
<t334>As soon as Margo left, I grabbed the car keys from the table.</t334> <t335>The keys were mine, but the car, ironically, was not.</t335> <t336>On my sixteenth birthday, my parents gave me a very small gift, and I immediately understood that they were giving me a car key.</t336> <t337>I was so happy I almost peed myself because my parents had always said they couldn't afford to buy me a car.</t337> <t338>But when they handed me the tiny gift box, I knew right away that they had just been teasing before, and that I was finally getting a car.</t338> <t339>I tore off the wrapping paper and opened the little box.</t339> <t340>Sure enough, inside was a key.</t340>
<t341>Upon closer inspection, it was a Chrysler car key.</t341> <t342>The key to a Chrysler minivan.</t342> <t343>It was indeed mom's Chrysler minivan.</t343>
<t344>"Is the gift for me your car keys, Mom?" I asked her.</t344>
<t345>“Tom,” Mom turned to Dad and said, “I told you that the boy would have high expectations.”</t345>
<t346>“Hey, don't blame me,” Dad said.</t346> <t347>“You're kicking your stress into my paycheck.”</t347>
<t348>“Isn't that a somewhat passive-aggressive hasty analysis?” Mom asked back.</t348>
<t349>“When making a rhetorical accusation of passive-aggressive behavior, isn't it true that those very accusations are inherently passive-aggressive themselves?” Dad retorted, and Mom and Dad continued like that for quite a while.</t349>
<t350>But sooner or later, it all comes down to this: I get to enjoy the wonderful transportation of the old Chrysler minivan, except when my mom is driving.</t350> <t351>And since my mom drives to work every morning, I can only use it on weekends.</t351> <t352>Well, weekends and the odd hours around midnight.</t352>
<t353>Margo took more than a minute as promised to return to my window, but not too long.</t353> <t354>Just as we were about to set off, my mind started to feel cluttered.</t354> <t355>"I have to go to school tomorrow," I said to Margo.</t355>
<t356>“Yeah, I know,” Margo replied. “We have to go to school tomorrow, and the day after too, but boys taking a long time to think things through can drive girls crazy.</t356> <t357>Alright, let's consider this night school.</t357> <t358>So now we go, because we have to be back before dawn.</t358><t359>”</t359>
<t360>“I don't know.”</t360>
<t361>“Q,” she said. “Q.</t361> <t362>My good friend.</t362> <t363>How long have we been close friends?”</t363>
<t364>"We are not friends.</t364> <t365>We are neighbors."</t365>
<t366>“Oh my God, Q, oh Q. Have I done anything bad to you?”</t366> <t367>“Didn't I tell my countless juniors at school to be nice to you?”</t367>
<t368>"Hmm," I mumbled, although I had always suspected that it was Margo who had stopped Chuck Parson and his gang from messing with us.</t368>
<t369>She blinked, her entire row of lashes also darkened. "Q," Margo said, "we have to go."</t369>
<t370>And so I went.</t370> <t371>I quietly jumped through the window, and we crouched and ran along the side of the house until we could open the door of the minivan.</t371> <t372>Margo whispered not to close the car door—it would make too much noise—so with the door left open, I didn't start the car but pushed my foot against the cement, letting the car slowly roll down the road.</t372> <t373>We slowly passed a few houses before I started the engine and turned on the lights.</t373> <t374>We closed the car door, and I began driving through the seemingly endless winding streets of Jefferson Park, the houses still new and made of plastic, looking like a toy village with tens of thousands of real people.</t374>
<t375>Margo began to tell. "The problem is that my parents don't really care, no matter how many cool feats I achieve, they just see it as ruining their reputation.</t375> <t376>Like just now, do you know what my dad said? 'I don't care what you do with your life, but don't embarrass us in front of the Jacobsens—they're friends of ours.'</t376> <t377>It's really funny.</t377> <t378>And you have no idea how much my parents have scraped to get that huge house.</t378> <t379>You know in those prison break movies, where they stuff clothes under the blanket to pretend someone's lying there?" I nodded.</t379> <t380>"Yeah, well, my mom set up this stupid baby monitor in my room to listen to me breathe while I sleep every night.</t380> <t381>So I had to pay Ruthie five bucks to sleep in my room, while I stuffed a bunch of clothes on her bed."</t381> <t382>Ruthie is Margo's younger sister.</t382> <t383>"So it turned into a whole Mission Impossible thing.</t383> <t384>I used to just sneak out of the house, like any normal damn American—just climb out the window and jump off the roof.</t384> <t385>But my god, now it's like living under a fascist dictatorship."</t385>
<t386>“Can you tell me where we are going?”</t386>
<t387>“Well, first go to Publix supermarket.</t387> <t388>For reasons I will explain later, I need you to go in and buy things for me.</t388> <t389>Then we will go to the Wal-Mart store.”</t389>
<t390>“What, are we going to take a grand tour through the shopping spots in Central Florida?” I asked.</t390>
<t391>“Tonight, my dear friend, we will correct many wrongs.</t391> <t392>And we will do some wrongs to the right things.</t392> <t393>The first will be last and the last will be first, the meek will inherit the earth, just you wait and see.</t393> <t394>But before we can fundamentally reshape the world, we need to go shopping first.” So I drove to Publix, the parking lot was almost empty, and we parked.</t394>
<t395>“Hey,” Margo said, “how much money do you have right now?”</t395>
<t396>“Not a penny or a cent,” I replied.</t396> <t397>I turned off the engine and looked at her.</t397> <t398>Margo reached into the pocket of her dark jeans and pulled out a few hundred-dollar bills.</t398> <t399>“Thank goodness, here they are,” she said.</t399>
<t400>“What is this money for?” I asked.</t400>
<t401>“The money is from my Bat Mitzvah coming-of-age ceremony, you idiot.</t401> <t402>I'm not supposed to touch the account, but I totally know my parents' password because they use ‘myrnamountw3az3l’ for everything.</t402> <t403>So I just withdrew it.” I tried to blink away my dumbfounded look, but Margo had already seen the way I was looking at her and smirked at me.</t403> <t404>“Simply put,” she said, “this is going to be the best night of your life.”</t404>
<t405>3.</t405>
<t406>About Margo Roth Spiegelman, all I could do was let her talk, and when she stopped, I would encourage her to keep going, because the truth is 1.</t406> <t407>It cannot be denied that I liked her, 2. From every angle, it was completely unpredictable what she would do, and 3.</t407> <t408>She never really asked me anything, so the only way to avoid silence was to encourage her to keep the story going.</t408>
<t409>In the parking lot of the Publix supermarket, she said, "Alright, here you go.</t409> <t410>I've made a list for you.</t410> <t411>If you have any questions, just call my cell phone.</t411> <t412>Oh, by the way, speaking of which, I took the liberty of putting some stuff in the back of the car."</t412>
<t413>“Huh, what, even when I haven't agreed yet?”</t413>
<t414>“Uh, yeah.</t414> <t415>That's actually the case.</t415> <t416>Anyway, if you have any questions, just give me a call.</t416> <t417>As for Vaseline, you need to get a size slightly bigger than your fist.</t417> <t418>There's this Baby Vaseline, then there's Mommy Vaseline, and then there's Daddy Vaseline, which is the one you need to buy.</t418> <t419>If you can't find that, then get, let's see, three jars of Mommy Vaseline.”</t419> <t420>Margo handed me the list and a hundred dollars, saying.</t420> <t421>“This should be enough.” Margo's list:</t421>
<t422>_3 catfish, individually wrapped</t422>
<t423>Veet (For cleaning leg hair Only when you don't Need a razor In the cosmetics section for Girls)</t423>
<t424>Vaseline</t424>
<t425>six bottles, Mountain Dew</t425>
<t426>Twelve Tulip flowers</t426>
<t427>a Bottle of Water</t427>
<t428>Tissue paper</t428>
<t429>a Sky Blue Spray Paint Can</t429>
<t430>“This style of capitalization is interesting,” I remarked.</t430>
<t431>“Yeah, I totally advocate for the whimsical capitalization style.”</t431> <t432>“The conventional capitalization rules are very unfair to words that don't start a sentence.”</t432>
<t433>Well, I wonder what you would say to the supermarket cashier at twelve-thirty at night when you place on the checkout counter about six kilograms of catfish, Veet hair removal cream, a tube of Vaseline in the extra-large size, a pack of six bottles of Mountain Dew, a can of sky blue spray paint, and twelve tulips.</t433> <t434>And here is what I said: "It looks a bit odd, but it's not that bad actually."</t434>
<t435>The cashier cleared her throat but didn't look up. "So it's still weird," I heard her mutter.</t435>
<t436>"I really don't want to get involved in any trouble," I said to Margo as I turned back to the minivan, while she poured water from the bottle to clean the black stuff off her face with a tissue.</t436> <t437>Apparently, she only needed that camouflage to get out of the house.</t437> <t438>"In the acceptance letter that Duke University sent me, they clearly stated that they would not admit me if I got arrested by the police."</t438>
<t439>“You are very foresighted, Q.”</t439>
<t440>“So please don't get involved in any troublesome matters,” I said.</t440> <t441>“It's true that I also enjoy having fun and all sorts of things, but not at the cost of, let's see, my future for example.</t441><t442>”</t442>
<t443>Margo looked up at me, her face almost completely clean, with a faint, vague smile.</t443> <t444>“I'm surprised, that damn mess is still far away and you're already freaking out.”</t444>
<t445>“Huh?”</t445>
<t446>"University: attend or not attend.</t446> <t447>Problems: get involved or not get involved.</t447> <t448>High school: get an A or a D. Career: build it or not build it.</t448> <t449>House: big or small, buy it outright or rent.</t449> <t450>Money: have it or not have it.</t450> <t451>It's all a boring mess."</t451>
<t452>I was about to say that it was clear Margo wasn't paying serious attention at all, because she was a good student and next year she would be attending the honors bachelor's program at the University of Florida, but Margo shouted, "Wal-Mart."</t452>
<t453>We went into Wal-Mart together and chose a tool that the TV commercials call The Club, which locks the car's steering wheel.</t453> <t454>While passing through the children's section, I asked Margo, "What are we buying The Club for?"</t454>
<t455>Margo responded in a monologue style mixed with a familiar excitement without directly answering my question. "You know, from ancient times and for a very long period in human history, the average lifespan of humans was less than thirty.</t455> <t456>That means people had about ten years of adulthood, right?</t456> <t457>So there was no need to plan for retirement.</t457> <t458>No career planning either.</t458> <t459>No concept of planning at all.</t459> <t460>There was no time to plan.</t460> <t461>No time for the future.</t461> <t462>But then lifespans started to lengthen, and people began to have more of what we call the future, so they spent more time thinking about it.</t462> <t463>Thinking about the future.</t463> <t464>And now life has become the future.</t464> <t465>Every moment in your life is lived for the future—you go to high school to get into college to get a good job to buy a nice house to earn money to send your kids to college so they can get good jobs to buy nice houses to earn money to send their kids to college."</t465>
<t466>It seems like Margo keeps mumbling like that to avoid answering the obvious question.</t466> <t467>So I repeated.</t467> <t468>“Why do we need this The Club?”</t468>
<t469>Margo gently patted my back.</t469> <t470>"Didn't I tell you that everything would become clear before dawn?"</t470> <t471>And then, in the boating equipment section, Margo picked up an air horn.</t471> <t472>She took it out of the box and raised it high, and I immediately said, "No, don't," and Margo asked back, "What do you mean, don't?" I continued, "You can't use an air horn here," but I had barely said the "u" in "use" when she pressed the horn and a piercing shriek tore through the air, buzzing in my head, as if my blood vessels were swelling and pounding.</t472> <t473>Margo calmly asked, "Sorry, I didn't hear you, what did you just say?" And I was in the middle of saying "Don't b..." when she pressed the horn again.</t473>
<t474>A Wal-Mart employee, probably just a few years older than us, came over and said, "Hey, you can't use an air horn here."</t474> <t475>Margo immediately responded with an apparently very sincere look, "Sorry, I didn't know," and the guy quickly said, "Oh, it's okay, really."</t475> <t476>The conversation probably would have ended there, except the guy couldn't take his eyes off Margo.</t476> <t477>Honestly, I don't blame him, because once you look at Margo, it's hard to look away.</t477> <t478>Finally, he said, "Do you two have any plans now?"</t478>
<t479>Margo replied, "Not much."</t479> <t480>"And you?"</t480>
<t481>He said, "I finish work at one o'clock, then I'll go to the bar in Orange, if you also want to go there.</t481> <t482>But you have to leave your younger brother somewhere, that bar checks IDs very strictly."</t482>
<t483>What belongs to her?! "I am not your little brother," I said while looking at that guy's sneakers.</t483>
<t484>So Margo started to play a game.</t484> <t485>“Actually, this is my cousin,” she said, moving closer, wrapping her arm around my waist, and I could feel each of Margo's fingers pressing into my hip bone.</t485> <t486>Then she added, “And he's my boyfriend.”</t486>
<t487>The guy walked away with wide eyes, Margo's hand still in the same position for another minute, so I seized the opportunity to put my arm around her shoulder. "You really are the cousin I like a lot," I said to Margo.</t487> <t488>She smiled, gently nudged me away with her hip, and left my embrace.</t488>
<t489>"Could it be that I don't know that?" she said.</t489>
<t490>4.</t490>
<t491>We drove along the I-4 highway, fortunately there was no one, and I followed Margo's directions.</t491> <t492>The clock on the dashboard showed 1:07.</t492>
<t493>“It's beautiful, isn't it?” she said as she turned away from me and stared out the car window, so I could barely see her face. “I really love driving fast under the streetlights.”</t493>
<t494>“Light,” I said, “the visible thing that reminds us of the Invisible Light.”</t494>
<t495>“So beautiful,” Margo exclaimed.</t495>
<t496>“T.</t496> <t497>S. Eliot,” I said. “You've read it too.</t497> <t498>In last year's National Language class.” In fact, I had never read the entire poem with that line, but a few lines from the parts I had read still lingered in my mind.</t498>
<t499>“Oh, so you were quoting poetry,” she said, sounding a bit disappointed.</t499> <t500>I saw Margo's hand placed on the main control panel.</t500> <t501>I could place my hand on that panel, and then our hands would be in the same place, at the same time.</t501> <t502>But I didn't do it.</t502> <t503>“Read it again,” Margo said.</t503> <t504>“Light, the visible reminder of Invisible Light.”</t504>
<t505>“Oh wow, it's truly wonderful.</t505> <t506>It must have moved your girl.</t506><t507>”</t507>
<t508>“The ex-girlfriend,” I corrected.</t508>
<t509>"Did Suzie dump you?" Margo asked.</t509>
<t510>“How do you know they kicked me?”</t510>
<t511>“Oh, sorry about that.</t511><t512>”</t512>
<t513>“Well, it is true after all,” I admitted, and Margo laughed.</t513> <t514>The breakup happened months ago, but I didn't blame Margo for not paying attention to such a bland love story.</t514> <t515>What happens in the music room stays in the music room.</t515>
<t516>Margo put her feet up on the control panel and wiggled her toes to the rhythm of her voice.</t516> <t517>She always had a way of talking like that, with a distinct up-and-down cadence, sounding like she was reciting poetry. “Oh right, yeah, I'm sorry.</t517> <t518>But I've got a similar story.</t518> <t519>My handsome boyfriend has been fooling around with my best friend for the past few months.”</t519>
<t520>I turned around but Margo's hair covered most of her face, so I couldn't tell if she was joking.</t520> <t521>"Are you serious?" She didn't respond.</t521> <t522>"But you were laughing with him this morning.</t522> <t523>I saw you two."</t523>
<t524>"I don't know what time you're talking about."</t524> <t525>"I knew about it before the first period, then I saw people talking to each other and I started yelling 'bloodthirsty murderer,' Becca rushed into Clint Bauer's arms while Jase stood there dumbfounded, his stinky mouth drooling."</t525>
<t526>It turns out I completely misunderstood the scene in the hallway this morning. "Strange, this morning Chuck Parson suddenly asked me what I knew about you and Jase."</t526>
<t527>“Yeah, I guess Jase told Chuck to go ask.</t527> <t528>Probably trying to get information for Jase to see who leaked the matter.”</t528>
<t529>"Oh my God, why is he messing around with Becca?"</t529>
<t530>“Tsk, she's not famous for her stellar personality or her shining chivalry, so it must be because she's hot.</t530><t531>”</t531>
<t532>“How could Becca be hotter than you?” I said without thinking of anything better.</t532>
<t533>“I always find it ridiculous that people get so hung up on someone just because of their looks.</t533> <t534>It's like choosing breakfast cereal based on color rather than taste.</t534> <t535>By the way, turn at the next corner.</t535> <t536>But I'm not beautiful, and I'm not intimate either.</t536> <t537>In general, the closer you get to me, the less warmth you'll feel from me.”</t537>
<t538>“Like that...” I was about to say.</t538>
<t539>“Forget it,” Margo dismissed.</t539>
<t540>In my heart, I felt a surge of injustice; why could a jerk like Jason Worthington easily snag both Margo and Becca, while perfectly decent and respectable people like me couldn't even get close to either of them, or any girl for that matter.</t540> <t541>In fact, I wanted to think of myself as the kind of guy who wouldn't bother with Becca Arrington.</t541> <t542>Sure, she might be hot, but she was 1. ridiculously stupid, and 2. a classic mean girl.</t542> <t543>The guys who hang around the music room with me have long suspected that Becca maintains her slim figure thanks to a diet consisting solely of cat souls and the dreams of poor children.</t543> <t544>"Becca is always up to no good," I said, trying to steer Margo back into the conversation.</t544>
<t545>“Yes,” she replied, still looking out the window by her seat, her shiny hair reflecting the light from the street outside.</t545> <t546>For a moment, I thought she was going to cry, but Margo quickly changed her mood, pulled her hat over her head, and took The Club out of the Wal-Mart bag. “Let's see, this game will be fun on every level,” she said as she forcefully tore open the packaging of The Club.</t546>
<t547>"Can I ask where we are going?"</t547>
<t548>“Becca's house,” Margo replied.</t548>
<t549>“Huh?” I exclaimed and hit the brakes, stopping the minivan and starting to tell Margo that I would take her home.</t549>
<t550>“There’s no burning houses, killing people, or forcing innocent people. Promise. We need to find Jase’s car.</t550> <t551>Becca’s street is the one ahead on the right, but he wouldn’t park there because Becca’s parents are home.</t551> <t552>Let’s try turning onto the next street.</t552> <t553>That’s the first thing.</t553><t554>”</t554>
<t555>“Alright,” I said.</t555> <t556>“Then go home, okay.”</t556>
<t557>"No, then we will move on to Part Two out of a total of Eleven Parts."</t557>
<t558>“Margo, that idea is not good at all.”</t558>
<t559>“Just keep driving,” she said, and so I kept driving.</t559> <t560>We saw Jase's Lexus two blocks away from Becca's house, parked in a cul-de-sac.</t560> <t561>I hadn't even fully stopped the car when Margo jumped out, holding The Club.</t561> <t562>She opened the Lexus door, the driver's side, sat in the seat, and began attaching The Club to Jase's steering wheel.</t562> <t563>Then she gently closed the Lexus door.</t563>
<t564>“That idiot never locks his bike,” Margo muttered as she got back into my car.</t564> <t565>She put The Club's key into her pocket, then reached over to mess up my hair. “Part One– done.</t565> <t566>Now, to Becca’s house.”</t566>
<t567>While I was driving, Margo began to explain Parts Two and Three.</t567>
<t568>"Sounds pretty good, huh," I said, though my stomach was rumbling with tension.</t568>
<t569>I turned onto Becca's street and parked two houses away from Becca's mansion.</t569> <t570>Margo crawled to the back of the minivan and returned with a pair of binoculars and a digital camera.</t570> <t571>She looked through the binoculars first and then handed them to me.</t571> <t572>I saw light coming from the basement of the mansion, but there was no movement.</t572> <t573>I was a bit surprised that the building had a basement–almost everywhere in Orlando, you can hit the water table without digging too deep.</t573>
<t574>I reached into my pocket to take out my mobile phone and dialed the number Margo had given me.</t574> <t575>The phone rang on the other end, once, twice, then a faint male voice picked up, "Hello?"</t575>
<t576>“Is that Uncle Arrington?” I asked.</t576> <t577>Margo wanted me to call because no one would recognize my voice.</t577>
<t578>"Who is it?"</t578> <t579>"Oh my God, what time is it?"</t579>
<t580>"Sir, there's something I think you should know, your daughter is currently fast asleep with Jason Worthington in the basement."</t580> <t581>Then I immediately hung up the phone.</t581> <t582>Part Two: complete.</t582>
<t583>Margo and I left the minivan door open, ran along the street, and crouched down behind the trees around Becca's yard.</t583> <t584>Margo handed me the camera, and I saw a bedroom on the upper floor light up, then the stairway and the kitchen, and finally the stairs down to the basement.</t584>
<t585>"Here it is," Margo whispered.</t585> <t586>I didn't understand what she meant until I glanced sideways and saw Jason Worthington, shirtless, hurling himself through the basement window.</t586> <t587>He shot across the lawn like an arrow, wearing nothing but a pair of shorts, and as he got closer, I jumped up and snapped a picture of him, completing Part Three. The flash from the camera seemed to stun both of us.</t587> <t588>He blinked at me through the darkness for a fleeting moment of bewilderment, then took off running straight into the night.</t588>
<t589>Margo grabbed my jeans, I bent down and saw her doubled over laughing like crazy.</t589> <t590>I reached out to help Margo up, and we ran back to the car together.</t590> <t591>I was turning the ignition key when she said, "Let's look at the photos."</t591>
<t592>I handed the camera to Margo, and we looked at the pictures on the screen together, our heads almost touching.</t592> <t593>Seeing Jason Worthington's shocked and pale face, I couldn't help but burst out laughing.</t593>
<t594>"Oh my god," Margo exclaimed and showed me.</t594> <t595>In a moment of panic and urgency, it seemed that Jason did not have time to tuck Little Jason back into his shorts, so the little guy was proudly exposed to the elements, digitally recorded and preserved for posterity.</t595>
<t596>“This creature,” Margo said, “is just like Rhode Island: it might have had a glorious history, but it's clearly tiny</t596><t597>.”</t597>
<t598>I looked back at the house and saw that the light in the basement was off.</t598> <t599>I felt a bit bad for Jason—it wasn't really his fault for having a tiny penis and a girlfriend who knew how to take sweet revenge.</t599> <t600>But back when I was in sixth grade, Jase promised not to punch my arm if I swallowed a live earthworm; I swallowed it, and he punched me straight in the face.</t600> <t601>So the feeling of guilt in me quickly faded away.</t601>
<t602>I turned to Margo, she was observing the house with binoculars.</t602> <t603>"Let's go," she said.</t603> <t604>"Down to the basement."</t604>
<t605>“What? Why?”</t605>
<t606>“Part Four. Steal his clothes in case he tries to sneak back into the house. Part Five. Give fish to Becca.</t606><t607>”</t607>
<t608>“No.”</t608>
<t609>“Yes.</t609> <t610>Right away,” Margo said.</t610> <t611>“She’s being yelled at by her parents upstairs.</t611> <t612>But how long can the lecture last?</t612> <t613>If it were you, what would you say? ‘You shouldn’t be fooling around with Margo’s boyfriend in the basement like that.’</t613> <t614>Basically, the lecture just keeps repeating that.</t614> <t615>So we have to hurry.”</t615>
<t616>Margo got out of the car, one hand holding a spray paint can, the other a package of fish.</t616> <t617>I groaned, "This is not a good idea," but I followed Margo, crouching down like she did, until we both stood in front of the open basement window.</t617>
<t618>"I'll go in first," Margo said.</t618> <t619>She stuck her leg through and stood on Becca's computer desk, half of her body inside the house, half outside.</t619> <t620>At that moment, I asked, "Should I stay out here and keep watch?"</t620>
<t621>“Get your skinny butt in here,” Margo replied, and so I did.</t621> <t622>Quickly, I grabbed all the boyish clothes I saw on the lavender carpet.</t622> <t623>The jeans with a leather belt, the slippers, the Winter Park Wildcats baseball cap, and the light blue t-shirt.</t623> <t624>I turned back to Margo, she handed me the fish package and one of Becca's purple glitter pens, telling me to write on the wrapping paper:</t624>
<t625>Message from Margo Roth Spiegelman: Your friendship with her–sleeps with the fishes.</t625>
<t626>Margo hid the packet of fish among the folded pairs of shorts in Becca's wardrobe.</t626> <t627>Hearing footsteps on the stairs, I tapped Margo on the shoulder and looked at her, my eyes almost popping out of their sockets.</t627> <t628>Margo just smiled and leisurely pulled out a spray paint can.</t628> <t629>I clambered through the window, turned back to see Margo leaning over the desk, slowly shaking the spray can.</t629> <t630>With a graceful motion—movements that immediately make one think of calligraphy or Zorro's sword strokes—Margo used the spray can to paint an "M" on the wall above the computer desk.</t630>
<t631>She raised her hand and I pulled Margo through the window.</t631> <t632>As soon as she set foot on the ground, we heard a sharp, piercing scream, "MR. DWIGHT!" I grabbed the pile of clothes and ran, Margo following closely behind.</t632>
<t633>I heard, but could not see, Becca's door swing open.</t633> <t634>I did not stop nor look back, even when a deep, thunderous voice roared "STOP!", and even when I unmistakably heard the sound of a shotgun being loaded.</t634>
<t635>I heard Margo mutter "gun" behind me–it didn't sound like she was worried or panicking, but just acknowledging the situation–and I didn't run around the hedge surrounding Becca's house but instead plunged straight through.</t635> <t636>I wasn't sure how I wanted to land–maybe a skillful somersault or something like that–but it turned out that I ended up sprawling on the asphalt, landing on my left shoulder.</t636> <t637>Luckily, Jase's pile of clothes had been thrown to the ground first, so my fall was somewhat cushioned.</t637>
<t638>I mumbled curses, and before I could prepare to stand up, Margo had already lifted me up.</t638> <t639>We got into the car and I drove in reverse without turning on the lights, so we almost hit the Wildcat Winter Park baseball team's catcher, who was nearly completely naked.</t639> <t640>Jase was running very fast, but it seemed like he was just running around aimlessly without knowing where to go.</t640> <t641>I felt the blade of regret cutting into me again as we passed him, so I rolled the window down halfway and threw his T-shirt out.</t641> <t642>Thankfully, he probably didn't see either Margo or me, and he had no reason to recognize the minivan because—I don't want to sound bitter or anything—I wasn't allowed to drive to school.</t642>
<t643>“What kind of devil prompted you to do that?” Margo asked as I turned on the lights and drove off, now trying to find a way out of this suburban maze to get onto the interstate highway.</t643>
<t644>"I feel sorry for him."</t644>
<t645>“Him? Why? Because he deceived me for six weeks?</t645> <t646>Because maybe he has infected me with some disease that only God knows what it is?</t646> <t647>Because he is a disgusting, stupid jerk who might live a life of luxury, a perfect example of the injustice of this universe?”</t647>
<t648>“He looks kind of pitiful,” I said.</t648>
<t649>"Forget about him.</t649> <t650>We will go to Karin's house.</t650> <t651>In Pennsylvania, next to the ABC Liquors store."</t651>
<t652>“Don't mess with me,” I said.</t652> <t653>“A man just pointed a shotgun at me because I helped you, so stop playing dirty with each other.”</t653>
<t654>“WHAT DID I DO TO YOU!” Margo screamed and slammed her fist down on the control panel.</t654>
<t655>"Wow, you're screaming."</t655>
<t656>“I thought maybe... I don't know.</t656> <t657>I thought perhaps he wasn't deceiving me.</t657><t658>”</t658>
<t659>"Uh."</t659>
<t660>“Karin told me when we were at school.</t660> <t661>And I guess many people have known for a long time.</t661> <t662>Yet no one told me, except Karin. I thought she was just trying to make something up.”</t662>
<t663>“I'm very sorry,” I said.</t663>
<t664>"Uh, uh, I can't believe I was moved."</t664>
<t665>“My heart is pounding hard,” I said.</t665>
<t666>“That's how you know you're having fun,” Margo said.</t666>
<t667>But it actually didn't feel like joy; it felt more like a heart attack.</t667> <t668>I pulled into the parking lot of a 7-Eleven, placed my finger on my carotid artery while counting the times the colon blinked on and off each second on the digital watch.</t668> <t669>When I turned around, I saw Margo staring at me wide-eyed. "My pulse is alarmingly fast," I explained.</t669>
<t670>“I can't remember the last time I felt so excited about something like this.</t670> <t671>Adrenaline surged up my throat and lungs.”</t671>
<t672>“Inhale through the nose, exhale through the mouth,” I continued her words. “All those little disturbances.</t672> <t673>Aren't they real...”</t673>
<t674>“Cute, huh?”</t674>
<t675>“Nowadays people consider that as childish impulsiveness, right?” Margo smiled.</t675> <t676>She crawled down to the back seat and returned with a small bag.</t676> <t677>What kind of random stuff is piled up back there?</t677> <t678>I thought to myself.</t678> <t679>She opened the bag and took out a bottle of dark red, almost black, nail polish.</t679> <t680>“While waiting for you to calm down, I'll paint my nails,” she said and smiled at me through her bangs.</t680> <t681>“Take your time.”</t681>
<t682>And we sat there, Margo with a bottle of nail polish balanced on the dashboard, me with my bony finger pressed against my pulse.</t682> <t683>The nail polish color was very eye-catching, and Margo's fingers were very beautiful, slender and bonier than the rest of her, with soft curves and gentle angles.</t683> <t684>Margo had the kind of fingers that made others just want to intertwine their hands with hers.</t684> <t685>I remembered those fingers on my hip in the Wal-Mart aisle, as if it had been many days ago.</t685> <t686>I heard my heart slow down.</t686> <t687>And I tried to tell myself: Margo was right.</t687> <t688>There was nothing to be afraid of out there, not in this little town, on this quiet night.</t688>
<t689>5.</t689>
<t690>“Part Six,” Margo said as we continued our journey.</t690> <t691>She waved her fingers in the air, looking like she was playing the piano. “Place flowers on Karin's doorstep with an apology note.”</t691>
<t692>“What did you do to him?”</t692>
<t693>“Well, when he told me about Jase, I shot the messenger right away.”</t693>
<t694>“What do you mean?” I asked.</t694> <t695>I sped through a traffic light, with some kids in a sports car next to me revving their engine as if I wanted to race in this Chrysler.</t695> <t696>Pushing it to go faster made it groan immediately.</t696>
<t697>“Well, I don't exactly remember what I called Karin, but it was something like a string of 'big-butted, buck-toothed, stupid, warty, smelly, weakling with the ugliest head in Central Florida'—and that was enough to offend her.”</t697>
<t698>“Karin's hair is really weird,” I said.</t698>
<t699>“I know. That is the only thing that is true in what I said about her.</t699> <t700>When saying bad things about others, you should never tell the truth, because in reality, you can never fully and sincerely take back those words, you understand? I mean, there are bright spots, there are differences, and there are really stinking vile things.”</t700>
<t701>The car stopped in front of Karin's house, Margo disappeared behind the car and then came back with a bouquet of tulips.</t701> <t702>On the stem of one flower in the bouquet, there was a piece of paper that Margo had folded, looking like an envelope.</t702> <t703>She handed me the bouquet, and I dashed across the walkway, placed the bouquet on Karin's doorstep, and then dashed back to the car.</t703>
<t704>“Part Seven,” Margo said as soon as I got into the car. “Giving fish to the lovely Mr. Worthington.”</t704>
<t705>“I think he hasn't come home yet at this time,” I said with a slight hint of regret.</t705>
<t706>“I wish that in a week the police would catch him barefoot, mentally deranged, naked as a jaybird, lying in a ditch by the roadside,” Margo said excitedly.</t706>
<t707>"Remind me to never make Margo Roth Spiegelman angry," I muttered, and Margo burst out laughing.</t707>
<t708>“Seriously,” she said.</t708> <t709>“We will unleash storms upon our enemies.”</t709>
<t710>“Your enemy,” I corrected.</t710>
<t711>“We'll see,” she replied quickly, then her face suddenly lit up. “Oh wow, I'll handle this.</t711> <t712>The problem is that Jason's house has a top-notch security system.</t712> <t713>And we can't afford to be hit by another terrifying blow.”</t713>
<t714>“Yeah,” I said.</t714>
<t715>Going down the street from Karin's house, you will reach Jason's place, the fancy area called Casavilla.</t715> <t716>All the houses in Casavilla follow Spanish architecture, with characteristic red tile roofs and everything else, except they were not built by Spaniards.</t716> <t717>The person who created those houses is Jason's father, one of the wealthiest real estate moguls in Florida.</t717> <t718>“Big and ugly houses for big and ugly people,” I said to Margo as I pulled the car into Casavilla.</t718>
<t719>"I give up."</t719> <t720>"If I unfortunately end up being someone with only one son and a house with seven bedrooms, please do me a favor and just shoot me."</t720>
<t721>We stopped in front of Jase's house, a bizarre case of architecture, overall resembling an oversized Spanish farmhouse, except for three huge Greek-style columns jutting straight up to the roof.</t721> <t722>Margo, with the second bag of fish in the back seat, bit open the pen cap with her teeth, and scribbled a line that didn't quite look like her usual handwriting:</t722>
<t723>MS's love for you: has rested peacefully with the fish</t723>
<t724>“I’m telling you, don’t turn off the car engine,” Margo said.</t724> <t725>She wore Jase's Winter Park Wildcats baseball cap backward on her head.</t725>
<t726>“Yes,” I said.</t726>
<t727>"Get ready to launch."</t727>
<t728>"It's okay," I replied, feeling my pulse quicken.</t728> <t729>Inhale through the nose, exhale through the mouth.</t729> <t730>Inhale through the nose, exhale through the mouth.</t730> <t731>Holding a bag of fish and a spray paint can, Margo opened the car door, slowly walked across the vast lawn in front of the Worthington house, and then hid behind an oak tree.</t731> <t732>She waved at me in the darkness, I waved back, and Margo took a deep breath, her cheeks puffing out, turned away and ran.</t732>
<t733>Margo had barely taken a step when the whole house lit up like a Christmas tree in the city center, and the sirens blared loudly.</t733> <t734>I briefly thought about leaving Margo to her fate, but I continued to inhale through my nose and exhale through my mouth as she ran towards the building.</t734> <t735>Margo tossed the fish package into the house through a window, the alarm was so loud that I could hardly hear the glass shattering.</t735> <t736>And then, because she was Margo Roth Spiegelman, she took the time to elegantly draw an M on the undamaged part of the window.</t736> <t737>Then Margo ran full speed back to the car, I had one foot on the gas pedal and the other on the brake.</t737> <t738>The Chrysler at that moment felt like it was in a Thoroughbred horse race.</t738> <t739>Margo ran so fast that the hat on her head flew off and fell behind, she jumped into the car and we sped off before she could even close the door.</t739>
<t740>I stopped the car at the traffic light at the end of the street, Margo exclaimed, "What's this?</t740> <t741>Let's go, go go go!" and I replied, "Oh, alright," because I had forgotten that I had thrown all caution to the wind and everything else, regardless and defiant.</t741> <t742>I ran through three more red lights in the Casavilla neighborhood, and we had driven a mile on Pennsylvania Avenue when a police car blared its siren and flashed its lights as it passed by.</t742>
<t743>“That last scene was really scary,” Margo said.</t743> <t744>“Even I found it scary.</t744> <t745>And to put it in Q's terms, my blood vessels were pumping a bit faster.”</t745>
<t746>"Oh my God," I said.</t746> <t747>"Couldn't you actually fit it into his car?</t747> <t748>Or at least leave it on the doorstep?"</t748>
<t749>“We are unleashing a storm, Q. It's not just scattered showers.”</t749>
<t750>"Tell me that Part Eight will be less terrifying."</t750>
<t751>“Don't worry. Part Eight is just child's play.</t751> <t752>We return to the Jefferson Park area. Lacey's house.</t752> <t753>You know her house, right?” I knew, but only God knows why Lacey Pemberton never bothered to invite me over.</t753> <t754>Lacey's house is on the other side of Jefferson Park, a mile from my house, a cute apartment above a stationery store–the very apartment building where the man who died used to live.</t754> <t755>I've been inside because my parents' friends live on the third floor.</t755> <t756>Before you can enter the apartment building, you have to go through two locked doors.</t756> <t757>I secretly thought that even Margo Roth Spiegelman would have a hard time breaking in.</t757>
<t758>"So, has Lacey been good or bad?" I asked.</t758>
<t759>"Lacey is extremely naughty," Margo replied.</t759> <t760>She was busy looking for any windows, turning away and not looking at me, so I only caught bits and pieces of what she said.</t760> <t761>"And we've been best friends since kindergarten."</t761>
<t762>“Then what?”</t762>
<t763>“Yet she didn't say anything about Jase to me.</t763> <t764>But that's not all.</t764> <t765>In summary, I think she's a bad friend.</t765> <t766>For example, do you think I'm fat?”</t766>
<t767>"Oh my God, not at all," I replied. "You..."</t767> <t768>I stopped myself from saying you are not scrawny, but that was the whole issue with you; the problem with you is that you don't look like a boy.</t768> <t769>"Don't you dare lose weight."</t769>
<t770>Margo burst out laughing, waved at me, and said.</t770> <t771>“You just like my big butt, don't you.” I didn't look at the road but turned back for a second and glanced at her.</t771> <t772>Actually, I shouldn't have done that, because Margo could read my expression, and this face was saying: Oh, first, I wouldn't exactly say it's big, and second, it is truly spectacular.</t772> <t773>But it's more than that.</t773> <t774>You can't separate Margo the person from Margo the body.</t774> <t775>You can't look at one without seeing the other.</t775> <t776>When looking into Margo's eyes, there is blue and also a color that is uniquely Margo.</t776> <t777>In the end, you can't say that Margo Roth Spiegelman is fat or thin, just like you can't say that the Eiffel Tower is lonely or not lonely.</t777> <t778>Margo's beauty is a perfection enclosed in a seamless shell–without a crack and uncrackable.</t778>
<t779>“But that girl is always blabbering about things like that,” Margo continued.</t779> <t780>“‘I’ll lend you my pants, but I doubt they’ll fit you.’</t780> <t781>And then ‘You’re so strong.</t781>
<t782>I love the way you make the boys go crazy because of your personality.</t782> <t783>You're always mocking me.</t783> <t784>It seems like she never says anything without intentionally trying to put me down.</t784><t785>”</t785>
<t786>"Dim."</t786>
<t787>"Thank you, Mr. Grammar to the Point of Annoyance."</t787>
<t788>"Grammar Expert," I said.</t788>
<t789>“Oh my God, I will kill you, just watch!” But Margo laughed as she said that.</t789>
<t790>I drove along Jefferson Park to avoid passing by my house and Margo's, in case our parents woke up and discovered we had snuck out.</t790> <t791>We followed the lake (Jefferson Lake), turned at Jefferson Court, into the central shopping street of the entire Jefferson Park area, which was eerily quiet and deserted at this hour.</t791> <t792>We saw Lacey's black SUV parked in front of a sushi restaurant.</t792> <t793>I parked the car a building away, the first available spot without streetlights.</t793>
<t794>“Could you please give me the last fish?” Margo asked.</t794> <t795>I was relieved to get rid of that fish because it was starting to smell.</t795> <t796>And Margo wrote on the wrapping paper in her style: your FriendShip with ms has Slept with the Fishes</t796>
<t797>We avoided the beams of streetlights, walking as naturally as possible even though one person (Margo) was holding a large fish wrapped in paper, and the other (me) was clutching a spray paint can.</t797> <t798>A dog barked incessantly, and the two of us froze, but then it quieted down, and we reached Lacey's car.</t798>
<t799>“Well, this is going to be harder,” Margo said when she saw the car was locked.</t799> <t800>She searched in her bag and took out a piece of wire that used to be a coat hanger.</t800> <t801>In less than a minute, Margo had the car door open.</t801> <t802>I could only stand there in awe.</t802>
<t803>Opening the door on the driver's side, Margo leaned over to open the other door for me.</t803> <t804>"Hey, help me lift the seat up," she whispered.</t804> <t805>We lifted the back seat together.</t805> <t806>Margo shoved the fish underneath and counted to three, and with a single motion, we dropped the seat down, crushing the fish.</t806> <t807>I heard the disgusting sound of the fish's guts being squished flat.</t807> <t808>I allowed myself to imagine how Lacey's SUV would smell after a day roasting in the sunlight, and I had to admit that a feeling of serene satisfaction welled up inside me.</t808> <t809>Then Margo said, "Spray an M on the roof for me."</t809>
<t810>Without thinking for even a second, I nodded immediately, climbed onto the rear bumper, leaned forward, and quickly sprayed a giant letter M on the roof of the car.</t810> <t811>In general, I am against all forms of vandalism.</t811> <t812>But in general, I am also against Lacey Pemberton–and ultimately, that is a deeper and more profound verdict.</t812> <t813>I jumped off the car, ran quickly in the dark–starting to breathe more heavily and rapidly–towards the minivan a block away.</t813> <t814>When I placed my hand on the steering wheel, I realized my index finger was blue.</t814> <t815>I held it up for Margo to see.</t815> <t816>She laughed, held up her own blue finger, and our fingers touched, Margo's soft blue finger touching mine, and the blood in my veins couldn't slow down.</t816> <t817>After a long moment, Margo finally said: “Part Nine–downtown.”</t817>
<t818>It was 2:49 AM.</t818> <t819>Never in my entire life had I felt so exhausted.</t819>
<t820>6.</t820>
<t821>Tourists never come to downtown Orlando because there's nothing there except a few skyscrapers belonging to banks and insurance companies.</t821> <t822>The downtown area is completely deserted at night and on weekends, except for a few scattered nightclubs, half of whose patrons are either miserable or miserably staggering.</t822> <t823>As I drove, Margo directed me through the maze of one-way streets, and we saw a few people sleeping on the sidewalks or sprawled on benches, but none of them were moving.</t823> <t824>Margo rolled down the car window, and the air from outside rushed onto my face, warmer than the usual night weather.</t824> <t825>I glanced over and saw a few strands of her hair blowing across her face. Even though Margo was right there, I still felt completely alone among these massive, empty skyscrapers, as if I were the sole survivor of an apocalypse and the world had been entrusted to me, this entire endless and hidden world full of surprises, all for me to explore to my heart's content.</t825>
<t826>“Are you just going to lead me around in circles like this?” I asked.</t826>
<t827>“No,” Margo replied. “I’m giving directions to the SunTrust building, right next to the Asparagus Tree.”</t827>
<t828>“Oh,” I exclaimed, for the first time tonight I knew some useful information.</t828> <t829>“That place is to the south.”</t829> <t830>I drove through a few blocks and then turned.</t830> <t831>Margo cheerfully pointed, yes, there it was, in front of us, the Asparagus Tree.</t831>
<t832>The Asparagus Tree is actually not the asparagus shoot growing from the ground, nor is it related to any part of the asparagus.</t832> <t833>It is merely a sculpture that bizarrely resembles an asparagus tree about ten meters tall, though I have also heard many people say that it looks like:</t833>
<t834>1.</t834> <t835>A bean plant climbing on green glass</t835>
<t836>2.</t836> <t837>An abstract simulation of a tree</t837>
<t838>3.</t838> <t839>The Washington Monument, a greener version, seems more like scrap and uglier</t839>
<t840>4.</t840> <t841>The giant green phallic statue of the Jolly Green Giant</t841>
<t842>From every angle, the sculpture didn't resemble the Tower of Light, its real name, at all.</t842> <t843>I stopped in front of a clock post in the parking lot and looked over at Margo, seeing her staring blankly into the distance, her eyes empty, not looking at the Asparagus Tree but gazing far beyond it.</t843> <t844>For the first time, I felt that something was wrong—not the my-boyfriend-is-a-jerk kind of wrong, but something truly amiss. I should have said something.</t844> <t845>Probably.</t845> <t846>I should have talked about this, that, here, there.</t846> <t847>But I only said, "Let me ask you, why did you bring me to the Asparagus Tree?"</t847>
<t848>She turned around and smiled at me.</t848> <t849>Margo was so beautiful that even her fake smiles were believable.</t849> <t850>"We will check the progress of the work.</t850> <t851>And the ideal place to do that is from the roof of the SunTrust building."</t851>
<t852>I widened my eyes. "No.</t852> <t853>No way.</t853> <t854>Not a chance.</t854> <t855>You said there would be no sneaking in and out without permission."</t855>
<t856>“This is not a stealthy break-in.</t856> <t857>Just go in, because there is an unlocked door.</t857><t858>”</t858>
<t859>“Margo, that's so ridiculous.</t859> <t860>All...”</t860>
<t861>“Let me recap for you, tonight we've been involved in a bunch of sneaky break-ins and unauthorized entries.</t861> <t862>Breaking into Becca's house.</t862> <t863>Slipping into Jase's house.</t863> <t864>Now we're going to enter here properly.</t864> <t865>But we can't both sneak in and enter at will.</t865> <t866>Technically, the police could arrest us for sneaky break-ins or unauthorized entries, but they can't arrest us for both sneaky break-ins and unauthorized entries.</t866> <t867>So I'm still keeping my promise.”</t867>
<t868>“The SunTrust building must have some security personnel or something,” I said.</t868>
<t869>“Yes,” she replied, unbuckling her seatbelt.</t869> <t870>“Of course they have security.</t870> <t871>His name is Gus.”</t871>
<t872>We entered through the main gate.</t872> <t873>Sitting behind a wide semicircular desk was a young man with a faint goatee, wearing a Regents Security company uniform.</t873> <t874>"What's up, Margo?" he asked.</t874>
<t875>“Hello, Gus,” she replied.</t875>
<t876>"Which kid is that?"</t876>
<t877>WE ARE THE SAME AGE! I wanted to scream, but let Margo speak instead: "My classmate, his name is Q. Q, this is Gus."</t877>
<t878>“What’s going on, Q?” Gus asked.</t878>
<t879>Oh, we just scattered dead fish around the city, smashed a few windows, took photos of naked guys, and now we're going to have some fun in the hallway of a skyscraper at three fifteen in the morning, something like that. "Nothing significant," I replied.</t879>
<t880>"The elevator doesn't go up at night," Gus said.</t880> <t881>"It has to be turned off at three o'clock.</t881> <t882>You two can just use the stairs."</t882>
<t883>"Alright, see you later, Gus."</t883>
<t884>"Yes, Margo."</t884>
<t885>“How on earth do you know the security guard at the SunTrust building?” I asked as we both safely climbed the stairs.</t885>
<t886>“When we entered high school, he was in his final year,” Margo replied. “We need to hurry up.”</t886> <t887>“Time is wasting away.”</t887> <t888>She started taking the stairs two at a time, rushing up, one hand gripping the stair railing, and I struggled to keep up.</t888> <t889>Margo didn’t play any sports but liked to jog–I occasionally saw her running alone while listening to music in Jefferson Park. But I didn’t like running.</t889> <t890>Or maybe that’s why I didn’t participate in any strenuous physical activities.</t890> <t891>Now I tried to maintain a steady pace, wiping the sweat pouring down my forehead and ignoring the throbbing pain in my calves.</t891> <t892>When I reached the twenty-fifth floor, Margo was already standing at the landing, waiting for me.</t892>
<t893>“Look at this,” she said, opening the door next to the stairs, and we walked into a spacious room with an oak table as long as two cars and walls with windows stretching from floor to ceiling. “Conference room,” Margo said.</t893> <t894>“In the whole building, this is the place with the best view.”</t894> <t895>I followed her as she walked along the row of windows. “There, that spot,” she said, pointing, “is Jefferson Park. Can you see our house?</t895> <t896>The lights are still off, so that's good.” She moved a few more windows down. “That's Jase's house.</t896> <t897>The lights are off, no more police cars.</t897> <t898>Great, although that could mean he's already sneaked back home, which is a bit boring.” Becca's house is too far away to see, even from here.</t898>
<t899>Margo was silent for a moment, then walked towards the glass door and pressed her forehead against it.</t899> <t900>I lingered behind, but she tugged at my t-shirt and pulled me forward.</t900> <t901>I didn't want to put the weight of both of us on a single pane of glass, but Margo kept pulling me, and I could feel her hand right next to mine.</t901> <t902>So, in the end, I rested my head against the glass, as cautiously as possible, and looked outside.</t902>
<t903>From above, Orlando shines brightly.</t903> <t904>Below, I can see the NO PEDESTRIAN sign flashing at the traffic roundabout, the streetlights forming a perfect network, spreading out to the edge of the downtown area, where the winding streets of Orlando's endless suburbs begin.</t904>
<t905>“Beautiful,” I said.</t905>
<t906>Margo sniffled. "Really? Do you really think so?"</t906>
<t907>“Well, maybe it's not that beautiful,” I replied, even though I actually found it beautiful.</t907> <t908>When I looked at Orlando from the plane, the city looked like a LEGO toy set dropped into a green ocean.</t908> <t909>But here, at night, the city was a real place–for the first time, a place I could see.</t909> <t910>As I walked around the conference room, then to other offices on the same floor, I could see it all: a whole picture.</t910> <t911>The school.</t911> <t912>There was Jefferson Park.</t912> <t913>In the distance was Disney World.</t913> <t914>Wet ’n Wild water park. There was the 7-Eleven store where Margo painted her nails while I struggled to catch my breath. It was all here–my entire world, and I could see it completely, just by leisurely walking around a building.</t914> <t915>“Impressive,” I said aloud.</t915> <t916>“I mean, from a distance.</t916> <t917>You don't see any flaws, you know what I mean? You can't see the rust, the overgrown weeds, or the peeling paint.</t917> <t918>You see the city just as someone once imagined it.”</t918>
<t919>“Everything looks worse up close,” Margo said.</t919>
<t920>"Except for you," I replied without having time to think of anything better.</t920>
<t921>Margo still had her forehead pressed against the glass door, she turned back and smiled at me. "Here's the thing: you're adorable when you're confident.</t921> <t922>And less adorable when you're not."</t922> <t923>Before I could react, she had already turned her gaze back outside and started talking.</t923> <t924>"The ugly part is this: from here, you can't see the rust and decay, but you can tell what this place really is.</t924> <t925>You see that everything is just a facade.</t925> <t926>It's not even sturdy enough to say it's made of plastic or some synthetic material.</t926> <t927>This is a paper town.</t927> <t928>Look at it, Q: look at all those dead-end streets, those roads that loop back onto themselves, all those houses built just to be torn down.</t928> <t929>All those paper people living in those paper houses, burning their futures to keep warm.</t929> <t930>All those paper kids, drinking the beer some jobless bum bought for them at a paper convenience store.</t930> <t931>Everyone is going crazy in this frenzy of property ownership.</t931> <t932>All that fragile, paper-thin property.</t932> <t933>And all those people are just like paper.</t933> <t934>I've lived here for eighteen years, and I've never once in my life met anyone who cared about the things that really matter."</t934>
<t935>“I'll try not to think that you're talking about any specific person,” I said.</t935> <t936>We both looked at the ink-colored void, the dead-end streets, and the plots of land for houses.</t936> <t937>But her shoulder pressed against my arm, the backs of our hands touched, and even though I wasn't looking at Margo, pressing my face against the glass made me feel almost as if I were pressing my face against hers.</t937>
<t938>“Sorry,” Margo said.</t938> <t939>“Maybe everything would have been very different for me if I had been hanging out with you all this time instead of... well...”</t939> <t940>It's just that, gosh, I just hate myself so much, because I still care about my so-called friends.</t940> <t941>To be honest with you, it's not that I'm oh-so-heartbroken over Jason.</t941> <t942>Or Becca.</t942> <t943>Or even Lacey, though I really did like her.</t943> <t944>But that was the last connection.</t944> <t945>A weak connection, surely, but it was the one I had left, and every paper girl needs at least one connection, right?”</t945>
<t946>And this is what I said.</t946> <t947>“Mai, feel free to join us for lunch.</t947><t948>”</t948>
<t949>“So nice to me,” she replied, her voice fading.</t949> <t950>Margo turned back and nodded slightly.</t950> <t951>I smiled.</t951> <t952>She smiled.</t952> <t953>I believed that smile.</t953> <t954>We went to the stairs and then ran down the steps.</t954> <t955>At the end of each floor, I jumped over the last step and kicked my heels to make Margo laugh, and she did laugh.</t955> <t956>I thought I was making her happy.</t956> <t957>I thought she was easily cheerful and excited.</t957> <t958>I thought if I could be confident, maybe something could happen between us.</t958>
<t959>I was mistaken.</t959>
<t960>7.</t960>
<t961>Sitting in the minivan with the key in the ignition but the engine not yet started, Margo asked me, "By the way, what time do your parents wake up?"</t961>
<t962>“I don't know, maybe around six fifteen?” It's 3:51. “That means we have more than two hours and have already covered nine-tenths of the way.</t962><t963>”</t963>
<t964>“Yes, but I saved the hardest part for last.</t964> <t965>Anyway, it will be done soon.</t965> <t966>Part Ten—it's Q's turn to choose the victim.</t966><t967>”</t967>
<t968>"Huh?"</t968>
<t969>“I've already chosen the punishment.</t969> <t970>You just need to choose the person who will bear the storm of fury that we will unleash.</t970><t971>”</t971>
<t972>“The person must endure the raging storm that we will unleash,” I corrected her phrasing, and Margo shook her head in exasperation.</t972> <t973>“I don't really want to unleash my anger on anyone,” I said, because that was true.</t973> <t974>I always had the feeling that one had to be important to have enemies.</t974> <t975>For example: Historically, Germany has had more enemies than Luxembourg. Margo Roth Spiegelman is Germany. Is England. Is America. Is Russia during the Tsarist era.</t975> <t976>And me, I am Luxembourg.</t976> <t977>Just idly sitting around, herding sheep and singing folk songs.</t977>
<t978>“What about Chuck?” Margo asked.</t978>
<t979>"Hmm," I replied.</t979> <t980>Chuck Parson had been extremely terrible for many years before he was finally restrained.</t980> <t981>Besides the incident of throwing me onto the conveyor belt in the cafeteria, once he grabbed me at the school gate while I was waiting for the bus, twisted my arm behind my back, and ordered, "Admit that you're gay." It was the kind of insult-in-any-situation, because-my-vocabulary-only-has-twelve-words-so-don't-expect-me-to-insult-you-in-any-other-way kind of insult from Chuck.</t981> <t982>Even though this game was ridiculously childish, in the end, I still had to admit that I was gay, which really pissed me off because 1. I don't think anyone, let alone me, should say that word, 2.</t982> <t983>Even though it happened, I'm not gay, moreover 3.</t983> <t984>To Chuck, making someone admit they're gay was the worst form of slander, even though being gay is absolutely nothing to be ashamed of.</t984> <t985>I tried to tell Chuck that while he twisted my arm like he wanted to rip it out of its socket, but he insisted: "If you're so proud of being gay, why don't you just admit that you're gay, huh, you gay?"</t985>
<t986>As clear as day, when it comes to logic, Chuck is no Aristotle.</t986> <t987>But when he's nearly two meters tall and weighs over a hundred kilograms, that's something to be wary of.</t987>
<t988>“Doing a job for Chuck is fine,” I noted.</t988> <t989>So I turned the car around and drove back to the interstate.</t989> <t990>I didn't know where I was going, but it was definitely not downtown.</t990>
<t991>"Do you remember the time at Crown Dance School?" Margo asked.</t991> <t992>"Tonight, I suddenly remembered it.</t992><t993>"</t993>
<t994>“Yeah, I remember.”</t994>
<t995>“By the way, I apologize.</t995> <t996>I don't understand why I was persuaded by it back then.”</t996>
<t997>"Oh, it's okay," I said, but in reality, I was still holding onto the unforgettable incident at Crown Dance School. "Alright.</t997> <t998>Chuck Parson.</t998> <t999>Do you know where he lives?"</t999>
<t1000>“I knew I could expose your vengeful side.”</t1000> <t1001>“Chuck is at College Park. Turn at Princeton.” I turned onto the slope at the shoulder of the road, causing the car's undercarriage to scrape the ground. “Ouch,” Margo said.</t1001> <t1002>“Don't wreck this Chrysler.”</t1002>
<t1003>Back in sixth grade, the group of kids including Margo, Chuck, and me were forced by our parents to attend dance classes at Crown School, which specialized in character building and dance.</t1003> <t1004>During the lessons, the boys stood on one side, the girls on the other, and when the teacher instructed, the boys would step up to the girls and ask, "May I have this dance?" and the girls would reply, "Of course." The girls were not allowed to refuse.</t1004> <t1005>But one day–during the fox-trot lesson–Chuck Parson convinced every girl to refuse to dance with me.</t1005> <t1006>No one else.</t1006> <t1007>Just me.</t1007> <t1008>So when I approached Mary Beth Shortz and asked, "May I have this dance?" she said no.</t1008> <t1009>I asked another girl, then another, and even Margo, and she also said no, and another girl again, until I cried.</t1009>
<t1010>The only thing worse than being rejected in dance class is crying because you were rejected in dance class, and the only thing worse than that is tearfully running to the teacher to tattle, "The girls won't dance with me and they shouldn't be allowed to do that."</t1010> <t1011>Of course, back then I did tattle to the teacher, and for most of the remaining years in middle school, I had to live with that embarrassing incident.</t1011> <t1012>In short, Chuck Parson made sure I never fox-trotted again.</t1012> <t1013>For a sixth grader, it wasn't exactly a huge catastrophe.</t1013> <t1014>I no longer really dwell on it, just like I don't dwell on the other things Chuck did to me over the years.</t1014> <t1015>But I certainly wouldn't shed a tear if something bad happened to him.</t1015>
<t1016>"Wait, it won't find out about me, right?"</t1016>
<t1017>"Yes, not at all."</t1017> <t1018>"Why?"</t1018>
<t1019>“I don't want Chuck to get the wrong idea that I still care enough about him to want to get back at him.”</t1019> <t1020>I placed one hand on the car's dashboard and Margo gently patted it. “Don't worry,” she said.</t1020> <t1021>“Chuck will never know who shaved him bald.”</t1021>
<t1022>"It seems like you just used the wrong word, but I don't know what that word means."</t1022><t1023></t1023>
<t1024>"I know a word that you don't know," Margo exclaimed.</t1024>
<t1025>“I AM THE NEWLY CROWNED VOCABULARY QUEEN! I HAVE TAKEN YOUR THRONE!”</t1025>
<t1026>“If you're so smart, spell the word 'usurpation',” I told Margo.</t1026>
<t1027>"No way," she laughed heartily. "I won't lose my throne because of a usurper.</t1027> <t1028>You have to show off better."</t1028>
<t1029>“Alright,” I smiled.</t1029>
<t1030>We drove into College Park, a historic district of Orlando, considering that most of the houses here were built about thirty years ago.</t1030> <t1031>Margo didn't remember Chuck's exact address, nor did she remember what the house looked like, and she wasn't even sure which street it was on.</t1031> <t1032>("I think there's a ninety-five percent chance it's on Vassar.").</t1032> <t1033>Finally, after the Chrysler slowly glided past three blocks on Vassar Street, Margo pointed to the left and said, "That house."</t1033>
<t1034>“Are you sure?” I asked.</t1034>
<t1035>“I'm about ninety-seven-point-two percent sure.</t1035> <t1036>Meaning, I'm quite sure Chuck's bedroom is right there,” she pointed. “Once he had a party, and when the police came, I jumped out of his bedroom window.</t1036> <t1037>I'm pretty sure it's that window.”</t1037>
<t1038>"It looks like there will be trouble."</t1038>
<t1039>“But if the window is left open, then it's not really sneaking in.</t1039> <t1040>It's just entering someone's house.</t1040> <t1041>We just entered SunTrust, and it wasn't that big of a deal, right?”</t1041>
<t1042>I burst out laughing.</t1042> <t1043>"You're about to turn me into a reckless guy."</t1043>
<t1044>“That's my big ambition.”</t1044> <t1045>“Alright, for the mission we need: Veet, a spray can, and Vaseline.”</t1045>
<t1046>"Done," I grabbed those items.</t1046>
<t1047>“Don't overwhelm me like that, Q. The good news is that Chuck sleeps like a hibernating bear—I know because last year I took National Language with him and he was still sound asleep even when Ms. Johnston whacked him with a copy of Jane Eyre.</t1047> <t1048>So we will climb through his window, open the door, take off our shoes, quietly go inside, and I'll handle Chuck.</t1048> <t1049>Then you and I will go in opposite directions in the house, we'll smear Vaseline on every doorknob, in case anyone wakes up, it will take them forever to get out of the house and chase us.</t1049> <t1050>We'll finish up with Chuck, do some painting on his house for fun, and then get out of there.</t1050> <t1051>And no talking while we're at it.”</t1051>
<t1052>I placed my hand on my neck vein, but I smiled.</t1052>
<t1053>We got out of the car and walked side by side, Margo reached out and held my hand, intertwining her fingers with mine, and squeezed tightly.</t1053> <t1054>I also squeezed my hand and glanced at her.</t1054> <t1055>Margo quietly nodded, I nodded back, and she released my hand.</t1055> <t1056>We quickly approached the window.</t1056> <t1057>I gently pushed the wooden frame up.</t1057> <t1058>It made a slight noise, but it opened right away.</t1058> <t1059>I looked inside.</t1059> <t1060>It was too dark, but I saw someone lying on the bed.</t1060>
<t1061>The window was a bit high for Margo, so I clasped my hands for her to step on with one socked foot, and I pushed Margo up.</t1061> <t1062>She got in so smoothly that even a real ninja would be envious.</t1062> <t1063>I jumped up, got my head and shoulders through the window, and with a twisting effort, I wriggled like a worm to get inside.</t1063> <t1064>Things would have gone smoothly if I hadn't accidentally brushed my two eggs against the window sill, causing such excruciating pain that I couldn't help but groan, leading to a terribly bad mistake.</t1064>
<t1065>The bedside lamp turned on.</t1065> <t1066>The person lying on the bed was an elderly man—clearly not Chuck Parson.</t1066> <t1067>He widened his eyes in horror and couldn't utter a word.</t1067>
<t1068>“Oh,” Margo spoke up.</t1068> <t1069>I was about to fall and dash straight to the car, but because of Margo, I stayed back, with my upper body inside the house parallel to the floor.</t1069> <t1070>“Sorry, we must have come to the wrong house,” she turned back and looked at me urgently.</t1070> <t1071>It was then that I realized I was blocking her escape route.</t1071> <t1072>So I slipped out of the window, grabbed my shoes, and ran straight away.</t1072>
<t1073>We drove to the other end of College Park to recover our composure.</t1073>
<t1074>"We both messed up last time," Margo said.</t1074>
<t1075>“Uh, you just got the wrong house,” I said.</t1075>
<t1076>“Right, but you're quite impulsive.” A minute of silence, then we just drove around.</t1076> <t1077>Finally, I said, “We can find Chuck's home address on the Internet.</t1077> <t1078>Radar can log into the school's directory.”</t1078>
<t1079>“Excellent solution,” Margo said.</t1079>
<t1080>So I called Radar, but his phone went straight to voicemail.</t1080> <t1081>I thought about calling his home phone, but his parents knew my parents, which would ruin everything.</t1081> <t1082>In the end, I suddenly had the idea to call Ben. Ben wasn't Radar, but he knew all of Radar's passwords.</t1082> <t1083>I called.</t1083> <t1084>The phone went to voicemail after a few rings.</t1084> <t1085>So I called again.</t1085> <t1086>Voicemail.</t1086> <t1087>Called again. Voicemail.</t1087> <t1088>Margo said, "He probably won't pick up," and as I called again, I said, "Oh, he'll answer." After four more calls, Ben finally picked up.</t1088>
<t1089>“Surely you called me to inform that there are eleven delicious young bunnies stripping in your house, and that they are longing for the Special Sensation that only Godfather Ben can provide.</t1089><t1090>”</t1090>
<t1091>“I need you to use Radar's account to log into the school's directory and look up an address. Chuck Parson.</t1091><t1092>”</t1092>
<t1093>“No.”</t1093>
<t1094>"Go," I said.</t1094>
<t1095>“No.”</t1095>
<t1096>“You will be glad you took action in this case, Ben.</t1096> <t1097>I promise.”</t1097>
<t1098>“Alright, alright, it's done.</t1098> <t1099>I did it while saying no–can't do anything but help, huh.</t1099> <t1100>Four-two-two Amherst.</t1100> <t1101>Hey, why the heck do you need the address of</t1101>
<t1102>Chuck Parson at twelve minutes past four in the morning?</t1102>
<t1103>“You should sleep for your own good.”</t1103>
<t1104>"I will think that it was all just a dream," Ben replied and then hung up.</t1104>
<t1105>Amherst was just a few blocks away.</t1105> <t1106>We parked on the street, in front of house number 418, gathered our gear, and crossed Chuck's lawn, the early morning dew trembling off the blades of grass, clinging to my calves.</t1106>
<t1107>Fortunately, Chuck's window was lower than the window of Mr. Di Nham's room that we mistakenly entered earlier.</t1107> <t1108>I gently climbed inside and helped Margo follow.</t1108> <t1109>Chuck Parson was lying on his back, sound asleep.</t1109> <t1110>Margo tiptoed towards him, and I stood behind her, my heart pounding.</t1110> <t1111>If Chuck woke up, he could very well crush the two of us.</t1111> <t1112>Margo took out the Veet cream, sprayed a dollop that looked like shaving cream into her palm, and then carefully applied it to Chuck's right eyebrow.</t1112> <t1113>He didn't move a muscle.</t1113>
<t1114>Then Margo opened the Vaseline jar—the lid popped off with a loud snap, but Chuck still didn't seem to wake up.</t1114> <t1115>Margo scooped a big handful into my hand, and we went in opposite directions in the house.</t1115> <t1116>I went from the front door, smearing Vaseline on the doorknob, then to a bedroom door that was ajar.</t1116> <t1117>I rubbed Vaseline on the inside doorknob, and gently, with just a slight click, closed the door.</t1117>
<t1118>Finally, I returned to Chuck's room–Margo was already there–we closed the door together and smeared a large amount of Vaseline on the doorknob.</t1118> <t1119>We spread the remaining Vaseline all over the window frame of his room, hoping that it would make the window harder to open after we closed it on our way out.</t1119>
<t1120>Margo glanced at the clock and raised two fingers.</t1120> <t1121>We waited.</t1121> <t1122>During those two minutes, we just looked at each other, and I gazed into the blue of her eyes.</t1122> <t1123>It was wonderful—in the darkness and quiet space, there was no risk of me saying something foolish to ruin the moment, and her eyes looked back at me, as if there was something in me worth looking at.</t1123>
<t1124>Then Margo nodded, and I approached Chuck.</t1124> <t1125>I wrapped my hand in the t-shirt, as Margo had instructed earlier, bent down and–as gently as possible–ran my finger over his forehead, quickly wiping off all the Veet cream.</t1125> <t1126>Along with every bit of hair that once was Chuck's right eyebrow.</t1126> <t1127>I was standing in front of Chuck with his right eyebrow on my t-shirt, when suddenly his eyes snapped open.</t1127> <t1128>In a flash, Margo grabbed the blanket and threw it over Chuck, and when I looked up, the ninja girl was already out the window.</t1128> <t1129>I hurriedly followed, while Chuck screamed at the top of his lungs, “MOM! OH MY GOD, MOM! THIEVES! THIEVES!”</t1129>
<t1130>I really wanted to say, "We only took your eyebrow stuff," but I had to keep my mouth shut while swinging out the window.</t1130> <t1131>I almost fell on Margo while she was spraying an "M" on the plastic siding of Chuck's house, then we both grabbed our shoes and sprinted to the car.</t1131> <t1132>I turned back to look at the house; the lights were on but no one had come out yet, a testament to the effectiveness of the doorknobs meticulously treated with Vaseline.</t1132> <t1133>By the time Mr. (or maybe Mrs., I couldn't see clearly) Parson managed to pull up the living room curtains and look outside, we were already leisurely driving back to Princeton Street, onto the interstate highway.</t1133>
<t1134>"Alright!" I shouted.</t1134> <t1135>"Oh my god, that's absolutely amazing!"</t1135>
<t1136>"Did you see that?</t1136> <t1137>Chuck's missing one of his eyebrows.</t1137> <t1138>His face always has this perpetual look of skepticism, like 'oh, really?</t1138> <t1139>You guys are telling me I only have one eyebrow?</t1139> <t1140>What a load of nonsense.'</t1140> <t1141>I love making that loser choose: shave off the left one or draw in the right one? Oh, it's so much fun!</t1141> <t1142>He even yelled for his mom, such a crybaby."</t1142>
<t1143>“Hey, why do you hate it?”</t1143>
<t1144>"I never said I hated him."</t1144> <t1145>"I just said he's a crybaby."</t1145>
<t1146>“But it seems like you were always friends with him,” I said, at least I thought she used to be friends with Chuck.</t1146>
<t1147>“Oh, I'm always friends with a lot of people,” Margo replied.</t1147> <t1148>She leaned over and rested her head on my bony shoulder, her flowing hair brushing against my neck.</t1148> <t1149>“So tired,” Margo said.</t1149>
<t1150>“Caffeine,” I said.</t1150> <t1151>She leaned back, grabbed a Mountain Dew for each of us, and I finished mine in two long gulps.</t1151>
<t1152>"Now let's go to the SeaWorld ocean world," Margo told me. "Part Eleven."</t1152>
<t1153>"What, are we going to Rescue Willy or something like that?"</t1153>
<t1154>“No,” she replied.</t1154> <t1155>“We will only go to SeaWorld, that's it.</t1155> <t1156>That's the only park I haven't snuck into yet.”</t1156>
<t1157>"We can't break into SeaWorld," I said, pulling the car into the parking lot of a furniture store and turning off the engine.</t1157>
<t1158>"There isn't much time left," Margo said and reached out to restart the engine.</t1158>
<t1159>I pushed her hand away, repeating.</t1159> <t1160>"We can't break into SeaWorld."</t1160>
<t1161>“You're rambling about breaking in again,” Margo paused and opened another bottle of Mountain Dew. The light reflected through the bottle, casting over her face, and for a second, I saw Margo smile at what she was about to say.</t1161> <t1162>“We are not breaking in anywhere.</t1162> <t1163>Don't think of it as breaking into SeaWorld. Think of it as going to SeaWorld at midnight and getting in for free.”</t1163>
<t1164>8.</t1164>
<t1165>“Alright, first of all, we are going to get caught,” I said.</t1165> <t1166>I didn't start the engine and began explaining to Margo why I hadn't done it yet, wondering if she could see me in this darkness.</t1166>
<t1167>“Of course we will be caught.</t1167> <t1168>So what?”</t1168>
<t1169>“That is illegal.</t1169><t1170>”</t1170>
<t1171>“Q, in your opinion, what kind of trouble could SeaWorld get you into?”</t1171> <t1172>I mean, God, after everything I've done for you tonight, can't you do one thing for me?</t1172> <t1173>Can't you stay calm and stop freaking out over every tiny adventure like this?” And then under her breath, Margo said, “I mean, come on, live a little.”</t1173>
<t1174>Now I'm really pissed off.</t1174> <t1175>I slipped my head through the cross-shoulder seatbelt so I could lean over the controls and look at her.</t1175> <t1176>“After everything YOU'VE done for ME?” I almost screamed.</t1176> <t1177>She wants confidence? I'm getting confident here.</t1177> <t1178>“Did you call my friend's dad, the friend who's clinging to MY boyfriend, so no one would find out that I made the call?</t1178> <t1179>Did you drive MY butt all over the place, not because you're oh-so-important to me, but because I needed a ride and you were right there?</t1179> <t1180>Is that the crap you did for me tonight?”</t1180>
<t1181>Margo did not look at me.</t1181> <t1182>She just stared straight ahead, towards the plastic-covered doors of the furniture store.</t1182> <t1183>“You think I need you?</t1183> <t1184>Don't you think I could give Myrna Mountweazel a dose of Benadryl to make her sleep like a log while I snuck the safe out from under my parents' bed?</t1184> <t1185>Or sneak into your room while you're sleeping and swipe your car keys? I don't need you, you fool.</t1185> <t1186>I chose you.</t1186> <t1187>And then you chose me back.” Now Margo looked at me. “And that feels like a promise.</t1187> <t1188>At least for tonight.</t1188> <t1189>In sickness and in health.</t1189> <t1190>For better or for worse.</t1190> <t1191>For richer or for poorer.</t1191> <t1192>Until dawn do us part.”</t1192>
<t1193>I started the engine and drove out of the parking lot, but putting aside all of Margo's team spirit, I still felt like I was being forced to do something, and I wanted to get to the bottom of it.</t1193> <t1194>"Alright, but when SeaWorld, the company, or any individual writes to Duke University, saying that the guilty Quentin Jacobsen broke into their facility at four-thirty in the morning with a wild-eyed companion, Duke University will go crazy.</t1194> <t1195>And my parents will go crazy too."</t1195>
<t1196>“Q, you will attend Duke. You will become a successful lawyer-or-something, start a family, have children, and live out this ordinary life.</t1196> <t1197>In your final moments, on your deathbed, when you are bitter and choking back tears in the hospital, you will tell yourself: ‘Oh, I wasted this damn life, but at least in my final year of high school, I snuck into SeaWorld with Margo Roth Spiegelman.</t1197> <t1198>At least I had one glorious day, carpe diem.</t1198><t1199>’”</t1199>
<t1200>“A glorious night, carpe noctem[5],” I corrected.</t1200>
<t1201>“Alright, you're the Grammar King again. You've just reclaimed the throne.</t1201> <t1202>Now take me to SeaWorld.”</t1202>
<t1203>Quietly driving along the I-4 highway, I realized I was thinking about the man in the gray suit who was found dead that year.</t1203> <t1204>Maybe that's why she chose me, I thought.</t1204> <t1205>And then, finally, I remembered what Margo had said about the dead and the connections—about herself and the connections.</t1205>
<t1206>"Margo," I broke the silence.</t1206>
<t1207>“Q,” she replied.</t1207>
<t1208>“You once said...</t1208> <t1209>The man who died that year, you once said that perhaps all the internal connections within him had snapped, and just now you were talking about yourself, and the last connection snapped.</t1209><t1210>”</t1210>
<t1211>Margo half laughed.</t1211> <t1212>“You worry too much.</t1212> <t1213>I don't want some kid to find me covered in flies and ants on a Saturday morning in Jefferson Park.” She paused for a moment and then said the crux of it.</t1213> <t1214>“I’m too proud for an ending like that.”</t1214>
<t1215>I chuckled, sighed in relief, and drove off the interstate.</t1215> <t1216>We turned onto International Drive, the shopping capital of this place.</t1216> <t1217>There are up to a thousand stores on International Drive, all selling the same thing: junk.</t1217> <t1218>Junk in all shapes and forms: seashells, keychains, glass turtles, Florida-shaped refrigerator magnets, plastic flamingos, you name it.</t1218> <t1219>In fact, there are a few stores on I-Drive that sell literal junk, like armadillo poop, four dollars and ninety-five cents a bag.</t1219>
<t1220>But at 4:50 AM, the tourists were still sleeping.</t1220> <t1221>The road was completely deserted, just like the other streets, as we drove from one parking lot to another.</t1221>
<t1222>“Go past those trees and you'll reach SeaWorld,” Margo said.</t1222> <t1223>She went to the back of the car, rummaging through her backpack or something.</t1223> <t1224>“I have enough satellite maps and have planned our operation, but weirdly I can't find them anywhere.</t1224> <t1225>Anyway, just go past the road with the trees, and on the left, there will be a souvenir shop.”</t1225>
<t1226>"To my left, there are about seventeen thousand souvenir shops."</t1226>
<t1227>“Yes, but there is only one right after you pass through the row of trees.</t1227><t1228>”</t1228>
<t1229>Indeed, there was only one such store. I parked the car in an empty spot, right under a streetlight, because it's very easy to lose your car on I-Drive.</t1229> <t1230>Only a super bizarre thief would try to steal this Chrysler, but I didn't relish the thought of explaining to my mom how and why her car disappeared in the middle of the night.</t1230>
<t1231>We stood outside, leaning against the tail of the minivan, the air hot and heavy to the point that I felt my clothes sticking to my skin.</t1231> <t1232>I had that eerie feeling again, as if someone was watching me but I couldn't see them.</t1232> <t1233>The night dragged on too long, my stomach ached after hours of anxious tension.</t1233> <t1234>Margo had found the map, under the streetlight, her green paint-stained fingertip tracing the route.</t1234> <t1235>“I think there's a section of fence right here,” she said, pointing to a dense patch on the other side of the tree-lined road. “I read about it online.</t1235> <t1236>A few years ago, they put up the fence because some drunk guy wandered into the park at midnight and got the idea to swim with Shamu, so Shamu ate him.”</t1236>
<t1237>"Is that really true?"</t1237>
<t1238>"Yes, but if that guy acts in a drunken state, we will strike when fully sober.</t1238> <t1239>We are ninjas after all."</t1239>
<t1240>“Ah, you must be a ninja,” I said.</t1240>
<t1241>“You are the noisy and talkative ninja,” Margo said, “but we are both ninjas.”</t1241> <t1242>She tucked her hair behind her ear, put on her hat, and tightened the drawstring; the light from the streetlamp illuminated the sharp features on her pale face.</t1242> <t1243>Maybe we were both ninjas, but only Margo was dressed appropriately.</t1243>
<t1244>“Alright,” she said.</t1244> <t1245>“Remember the map.”</t1245> <t1246>At this point, the most perilous part of the half-mile journey Margo had outlined was the moat.</t1246> <t1247>The terrain of SeaWorld was like a triangle.</t1247> <t1248>One side was the road, which Margo reasoned would frequently have security personnel patrolling at night.</t1248> <t1249>The second side bordered a lake with a circumference of at least a mile, and the third side adjoined a drainage ditch.</t1249> <t1250>From the map, this moat appeared to be as wide as a two-lane road.</t1250> <t1251>And in Florida, where there is a drainage ditch next to a lake, there are often alligators.</t1251>
<t1252>Margo put both hands on my shoulders and turned me to face her.</t1252> <t1253>"We might get caught, maybe, in that case, just let me do all the talking.</t1253> <t1254>You just need to act kind of innocent and straightforward, and we'll be fine."</t1254>
<t1255>I locked the bike, tried to smooth down my messy hair, and muttered, "I am a ninja."</t1255> <t1256>I didn't mean for Margo to hear it, but she exclaimed, "Damn, you really are a ninja."</t1256> <t1257>"Let's go quickly."</t1257>
<t1258>We walked through I-Drive, starting to find our way through the dense oaks and tangled bushes.</t1258> <t1259>I was a bit worried about the ivy's toxins, but ninjas aren't afraid of ivy toxins, so I charged ahead, arms raised in front of me, pushing the thorny branches aside to move towards the moat.</t1259> <t1260>Finally getting through the patch of trees and with a clearer view, I saw the road with rows of trees on the right and the moat straight ahead.</t1260> <t1261>Anyone sitting in a car on the road would surely see us, but there were no cars at all.</t1261> <t1262>We ran through the bushes together, turning towards the row of trees.</t1262> <t1263>Margo said, "Come on, come on!" and I darted across the six-lane highway.</t1263> <t1264>Even though there wasn't a soul on the road, I still felt a surge of excitement and a huge sense of wrongdoing as I dashed across such a big road.</t1264>
<t1265>After crossing the road, we crouched and walked through the knee-high rush grass by the roadside.</t1265> <t1266>Margo pointed to the tree line between the vast, expansive parking lot of SeaWorld and the dark, still moat.</t1266> <t1267>We ran along the tree line for about a minute, then Margo tugged at the back of my shirt and whispered,</t1267>
<t1268>"Just wade through the water."</t1268>
<t1269>"Please, ladies," I said.</t1269>
<t1270>"No, really."</t1270> <t1271>"Go ahead," she replied.</t1271>
<t1272>And I no longer thought about crocodiles or the stagnant, foul-smelling muddy swamp.</t1272> <t1273>I just took a running start and jumped as far as I could.</t1273> <t1274>I landed in waist-deep water and continued to wade forward.</t1274> <t1275>The water reeked and felt slimy on my skin, but at least from the waist up I was dry.</t1275> <t1276>Or at least I was until Margo jumped in, splashing water all over me.</t1276> <t1277>I turned around and splashed her back.</t1277> <t1278>Margo pretended to choke on water and grumbled:</t1278>
<t1279>"Ninjas do not splash water on their teammates."</t1279><t1280>"</t1280>
<t1281>“A real ninja doesn't fall down with a splash like that,” I said.</t1281>
<t1282>“Oh, you hit the nail on the head.”</t1282>
<t1283>I watched Margo climb up from the moat.</t1283> <t1284>I was secretly relieved that we didn't have to deal with any crocodiles.</t1284> <t1285>My pulse, if it was racing, was still at an acceptable level.</t1285> <t1286>Underneath Margo's unbuttoned coat, her black T-shirt was soaking wet.</t1286> <t1287>In short, many things were going smoothly, but suddenly I caught a glimpse of something shimmering on the water's surface right next to Margo.</t1287> <t1288>She jumped onto the shore, I saw Margo's Achilles tendon tighten, and before I could shout, the snake had already struck, biting her left ankle just below the hem of her jeans.</t1288>
<t1289>"Oh no!" Margo exclaimed, she looked down and said again, "Oh no!" The snake still hadn't left Margo's leg.</t1289> <t1290>I rushed over, grabbed the snake's tail, yanked it off her leg, and threw it straight into the moat.</t1290> <t1291>"Oh my God," Margo cried out. "What was that?</t1291> <t1292>Was it a cobra?"</t1292>
<t1293>"I don't know." </t1293><t1294>"Lie down, lie down," I said, then lifted Margo's leg in my hands and rolled up the cuff of her jeans.</t1294><t1295>Two drops of blood oozed from the bite, I bent down, pressed my mouth to the wound, and sucked hard, trying to draw out the venom.</t1295><t1296>I spat out the blood, intending to suck again, but she said, "Wait, I see it."</t1296><t1297>I jumped up in a panic, Margo said, "Oh my God, it's okay, this species isn't venomous."</t1297><t1298>She pointed towards the moat, I followed Margo's finger and saw a small striped snake gliding along the edge of the water, swimming right where the light shone down.</t1298><t1299>In the light, the snake looked just like a small lizard, not very scary.</t1299>
<t1300>“Thank goodness,” I said, sitting down next to Margo and catching my breath.</t1300>
<t1301>After looking at the bite and realizing the bleeding had stopped, she asked me, "How does biting my leg feel?"</t1301>
<t1302>"Delicious," I replied, because it truly was.</t1302> <t1303>Margo leaned slightly towards me, and I felt her arm press against my side.</t1303>
<t1304>"I shaved my legs this morning precisely for this reason, like: Oh, you never know, someone might urgently grab my calf to suck out the snake venom."</t1304>
<t1305>There was a chain-link fence in front of us, but it was only about two meters high.</t1305> <t1306>As Margo remarked, "Really, first a sneaky snake, and now this fence?"</t1306> <t1307>"This kind of security is an insult to ninjas." She climbed up, swung herself over, and climbed down as gracefully as if she were walking on a ladder.</t1307> <t1308>I also tried not to fall.</t1308>
<t1309>We ran through a small, dense thicket, clinging tightly to the large turquoise tanks, surely containing animals inside.</t1309> <t1310>We ran to a strip of asphalt road, from here I could see the large auditorium where Shamu once splashed water on me when I was little.</t1310> <t1311>Small speakers along the path were playing soothing instrumental music.</t1311> <t1312>Probably to make the animals feel calm too. "Margo," I said, "we're in SeaWorld now."</t1312>
<t1313>Margo replied, "Sure," and she started walking around while I followed.</t1313> <t1314>We stopped in front of the seal enclosure, but it seemed like there were no seals inside.</t1314>
<t1315>“Margo,” I said again.</t1315> <t1316>“We are in SeaWorld now.”</t1316>
<t1317>“Be happy,” she said without moving her lips. “Because security is coming.”</t1317> <t1318>I quickly dashed through the waist-high bushes, but Margo didn't run, so I stopped.</t1318> <t1319>A patrolman in a SEAWORLD SECURITY uniform approached and nonchalantly asked, “What's going on?” He was holding something–a pepper spray, I guessed.</t1319>
<t1320>To calm myself down, I wondered, Does he have regular handcuffs or does he use special SeaWorld handcuffs?</t1320> <t1321>Like handcuffs shaped like two dolphins arching their backs?</t1321>
<t1322>"Actually, we are on our way out," Margo said.</t1322>
<t1323>“Oh, I guess so,” the man said.</t1323> <t1324>“The question is, do you want to leave on your own or be escorted out by the Orange County Sheriff?”</t1324>
<t1325>“If both are the same to you,” Margo said, “then we would prefer to go out on our own.”</t1325> <t1326>I closed my eyes, wanting to tell Margo that now is not the time for sweet talk.</t1326> <t1327>But the man laughed.</t1327>
<t1328>“Do you know that a few years ago someone died here because they jumped into an animal enclosure?”</t1328> <t1329>“We were ordered not to let anyone go if they trespassed, no matter how beautiful they were.”</t1329> <t1330>Margo tugged at her t-shirt so it wouldn't cling to her body.</t1330> <t1331>It was only then that I realized he was talking about her chest.</t1331>
<t1332>“Oh, then I guess I have to arrest you all.”</t1332>
<t1333>“But the main issue here.</t1333> <t1334>You're about to finish work, want to go home, have a beer, and take a nap.</t1334> <t1335>If you call the police, they will take their precious time to come here.</t1335> <t1336>You're speaking your thoughts out loud, you know,” he said, and Margo raised her eyebrows in understanding.</t1336> <t1337>She fumbled her hand in the wet pocket and pulled out a hundred-dollar bill soaked with the water from the moat.</t1337>
<t1338>The guard said, "Well, miss, you should leave right away.</t1338> <t1339>If it were me, I wouldn't be wandering around the whale tank.</t1339> <t1340>There are security cameras on all night around there, and we don't want anyone to know that you were here."</t1340>
<t1341>“Understood,” Margo replied cautiously, and the guard continued towards the dark area.</t1341> <t1342>“Oh my God,” Margo muttered once he was out of sight, “I really don't want to shell out money to that pervert.”</t1342> <t1343>“But well, money is meant to be spent.”</t1343> <t1344>I could barely hear those words; the only thing I felt was a sigh of relief spreading across my skin.</t1344> <t1345>This crude sense of relief was well worth the previous worries.</t1345>
<t1346>“Thank God he didn't call the police,” I said.</t1346>
<t1347>Margo did not respond.</t1347> <t1348>She looked distant, her eyes squinted almost shut.</t1348> <t1349>"I feel like this time is exactly like when we went into the Universal Studios set," Margo said after a while.</t1349> <t1350>"This place is kind of cool, something like that, but there's nothing left to see.</t1350> <t1351>The thrill rides aren't operating.</t1351> <t1352>The interesting things are all locked up.</t1352> <t1353>At night, most of the animals are locked in different tanks." Margo turned her head and commented about the SeaWorld we were witnessing.</t1353> <t1354>"I think the fun part isn't about standing here."</t1354>
<t1355>“So where's the interesting part?” I asked.</t1355>
<t1356>"At the planning stage, I thought so. I don't really know anymore.</t1356> <t1357>We hope that doing something will be fun, but when we actually do it, it doesn't feel as enjoyable as we expected."</t1357>
<t1358>"I find this game quite fun," I admitted.</t1358> <t1359>"Even though there's nothing to see."</t1359> <t1360>I sat down on a bench, Margo sat down next to me.</t1360> <t1361>We both looked towards the seal area, but there were no seals inside, just a small island with nothing but a few rough plastic mounds.</t1361> <t1362>I could smell Margo right beside me, the scent of sweat and algae from the moat, the lilac-scented shampoo, and her skin, faintly reminiscent of freshly ground almonds.</t1362>
<t1363>The first time I felt tired.</t1363> <t1364>And I imagined the scene of us lying next to each other on the grass at SeaWorld, me lying on my back and Margo lying on her side, her arm draped over me, her head resting on my shoulder and looking at me.</t1364> <t1365>Doing nothing at all—just lying next to each other under the sky, the night here still so bright, obscuring all the stars.</t1365> <t1366>And it seemed like I could feel Margo's breath gently caressing my neck, and maybe we could just lie there until morning, people starting to walk past us as they enter, they would see us and think that we were visitors too, and then we would just blend in and disappear among the tourists.</t1366>
<t1367>But no.</t1367> <t1368>Still have to witness Chuck Parson with one eyebrow missing.</t1368> <t1369>Still have to whisper this story to Ben. Still have classes, the music room, Duke University, and the future.</t1369>
<t1370>"Q," Margo said.</t1370>
<t1371>I looked up at her, for a moment I didn't understand why she called my name, but then I completely snapped out of my half-awake, half-dreaming state.</t1371> <t1372>And I heard it.</t1372> <t1373>The speakers were playing music, but it was no longer gentle instrumental music, it was real music.</t1373> <t1374>An old jazz song that my father liked, called "Stars Fell on Alabama."</t1374> <t1375>Through the tiny speakers, you could hear the singer seemingly hitting a thousand notes at once.</t1375>
<t1376>And I feel the seamless thread connecting me to her, stretching all the way from when we were toddlers in the crib, to the man who died years ago, to the closeness of today.</t1376> <t1377>And I want to tell Margo that the most enjoyable part for me isn't in the planning, the action, or the escape; the most enjoyable part is seeing our threads meet, then separate, and come back together again–but saying it like that seems too cheesy, and besides, she was already standing up.</t1377>
<t1378>Margo's eyes, a miraculous shade of blue, blinked. At that moment, she was unbelievably beautiful, her wet jeans clinging to her legs, her face glowing in the soft daylight.</t1378>
<t1379>I stood up, extended my hand, and said, "May I invite you to dance this dance?" Margo curtsied, gave me her hand, and said, "Sure." I placed my hand on the curve between her waist and hip, and her hand rested on my shoulder.</t1379> <t1380>Step-step-step sideways.</t1380> <t1381>Step-step-step sideways.</t1381> <t1382>We danced the fox-trot around the seal area, the song still humming about the falling stars in the sky.</t1382> <t1383>"The slow sixth-grade dance," Margo said, and we changed positions, her hand on my shoulder and my hand on her hip, elbows interlocked, the two of us only half a meter apart.</t1383> <t1384>Then we danced the fox-trot again until the song ended.</t1384> <t1385>I took a step forward and dipped Margo, as we were taught back at Crown Dance School. Margo lifted one leg, putting all her weight on me as I supported her back.</t1385> <t1386>She trusted me, or she wanted to fall.</t1386>
<t1387>9.</t1387>
<t1388>We bought towels at a 7-Eleven store on I-Drive, trying to wipe off the sticky, smelly stuff from our clothes and skin.</t1388> <t1389>I filled up the gas tank just like before we drove all around Orlando.</t1389> <t1390>The seats in the Chrysler would be a bit damp when Mom drove to work, but I still held a slight hope that she wouldn't notice, as my mom was quite easygoing about these kinds of things.</t1390> <t1391>Overall, my parents believed that I was a serious kid, the least likely to engage in activities that could risk breaking into Sea World, and that my healthy neurodevelopment was a strong testament to their professional expertise.</t1391>
<t1392>I immediately took the time to go home, avoiding the interstate highway and taking the smaller roads.</t1392> <t1393>Margo and I listened to the radio together, trying to find which station had played "Stars Fell on Alabama," but then Margo turned it off and said, "In short, I think it was a success.</t1393><t1394>"</t1394>
<t1395>“Agreed,” I said, even though I was wondering what tomorrow would be like.</t1395> <t1396>Will Margo come to the music room before class to hang out with us?</t1396> <t1397>Will she have lunch with Ben and me?</t1397> <t1398>“I really wonder if tomorrow will be any different,” I said.</t1398>
<t1399>“Yeah,” Margo replied. “Me too.”</t1399> <t1400>She let those words drift into the wind, then continued, “Hey, speaking of tomorrow, to show my appreciation for your hard work and dedication during the unforgettable night we just had, I have a small gift for you.” She rummaged around her feet and then held up a digital camera.</t1400> <t1401>“Take it,” Margo said.</t1401> <t1402>“And use the power of the divine blink wisely.”</t1402>
<t1403>I laughed and put the camera in my bag. "I'll upload the photos when I get home, and I'll give them to you at school, okay?" I asked, hoping Margo would reply, Yes, at school, where everything will be different, where everyone will see that I'm your friend, and that I've decided to dump my ex-boyfriend, but she just said, "Yeah, anytime."</t1403>
<t1404>It was 5:42 when I turned into Jefferson Park.</t1404> <t1405>We drove down Jefferson Drive to Jefferson Court, turned onto my street, Jefferson Way. I turned off the headlights one last time and eased the car into the driveway.</t1405> <t1406>I didn't know what to say, and Margo didn't intend to say anything either.</t1406> <t1407>We stuffed all the trash into a 7-Eleven bag, trying to erase any traces so the Chrysler would look as if it hadn't just been through the past six hours.</t1407> <t1408>In another bag, Margo handed me the remaining items, Vaseline, spray paint, and the last bottle of Mountain Dew.</t1408> <t1409>My mind was racing with overwhelming fatigue.</t1409>
<t1410>With a bag in each hand, I stood next to the car, looking at her. "Wow, what a hell of a night," I finally said.</t1410>
<t1411>“Come here,” Margo said, and I took a step forward.</t1411> <t1412>She hugged me, the bags made it difficult for me to hug her back, but if I put the bags down, I might wake someone up.</t1412> <t1413>I felt Margo rise on her toes and her lips right next to my ear, each word clear, “I. Will. Miss. The. Times. Playing. With. You.”</t1413>
<t1414>“Why does it have to be like this,” I said loudly, trying to hide my disappointment.</t1414> <t1415>“If you don't like them anymore, then hang out with me.</t1415> <t1416>My friends are actually quite fun.”</t1416>
<t1417>Margo's lips were so close that I could feel her smile.</t1417> <t1418>“I’m afraid it won’t work,” she whispered.</t1418> <t1419>Then she moved away, but still looked at me, stepping back one step at a time.</t1419> <t1420>Finally, she raised her eyebrows, smiled, and I believed in that smile.</t1420> <t1421>I watched Margo climb up the tree, reaching the roof above her second-floor bedroom window.</t1421> <t1422>She pried open the window and crawled inside.</t1422>
<t1423>I entered the house through the unlocked front door, tiptoed through the kitchen into my room, stripped off my jeans and threw them into the corner of the closet near the window, downloaded Jase's photo, then got into bed, my head about to explode with the things I planned to tell Margo at school.</t1423>
<t1424>PART II</t1424>
<t1425>Grass</t1425>
<t1426>8</t1426>
<t1427>1.</t1427>
<t1428>I slept for about half an hour when the alarm clock rang at 6:32.</t1428> <t1429>But I was completely unaware that the alarm had been blaring for seventeen minutes.</t1429> <t1430>It wasn't until I felt someone shaking my shoulder and vaguely heard my mother calling, "Wake up, sleepyhead," that I started to become slightly alert.</t1430>
<t1431>“Yeeesss,” I replied, still half-asleep, feeling even more exhausted than at 5:55.</t1431> <t1432>Maybe I should just find an excuse to skip school, but the problem is I have a perfect attendance record.</t1432> <t1433>Even though I know that a perfect attendance record is not particularly impressive or even admirable, I still want to maintain it.</t1433> <t1434>Besides, I want to see how Margo will behave at school.</t1434>
<t1435>Entering the kitchen, I saw my dad saying something to my mom as they both had breakfast.</t1435> <t1436>Dad stopped when he saw me and asked, "How did you sleep, kid?"</t1436>
<t1437>“Slept soundly,” I replied, because it was true.</t1437> <t1438>Slept only for a short while but very deeply.</t1438>
<t1439>Dad smiled.</t1439> <t1440>"I just told Mom that I keep having this recurring dream that's quite stressful," Dad said.</t1440> <t1441>"In the dream, I go to college and take a Hebrew class, but the teacher doesn't know Hebrew, and the test isn't in Hebrew either—it's all a bunch of meaningless gibberish.</t1441> <t1442>But everyone acts as if that patched-up, nonsensical language and alphabet is actually Hebrew. I still have to take the test and write in a language I don't know at all, using letters I'm completely unfamiliar with."</t1442>
<t1443>"Sounds interesting," I said, though it actually wasn't that interesting.</t1443> <t1444>Nothing is as dull and boring as someone else's dream.</t1444>
<t1445>“That is a metaphor referring to youth,” my mother spoke up.</t1445> <t1446>“Written in a language–adulthood–that we do not understand, using an alphabet–social interactions perceived with maturity–that we do not recognize.”</t1446> <t1447>My mother worked with crazy and insane teenagers in reform schools and juvenile detention centers.</t1447> <t1448>I think that’s why she never really worried about me–as long as I wasn’t dismembering pet mice for sacrifices or peeing on my own face, she concluded that she had successfully raised me.</t1448>
<t1449>A typical mother would probably say, "Hey, I found out, you look like you're high on something, and you smell like mud and algae.</t1449> <t1450>Did you just dance with that girl Margo Roth Spiegelman who got bitten by a snake a few hours ago?" But no.</t1450> <t1451>My parents prefer to talk about dreams.</t1451>
<t1452>I took a shower, put on a T-shirt and jeans.</t1452> <t1453>It's late, but then again, I'm always late anyway.</t1453>
<t1454>"You're late, dear," Mom said as I returned to the kitchen.</t1454> <t1455>I shook my head to clear away the fog in my brain, just enough to remember how to tie my shoelaces.</t1455>
<t1456>"I know already," I whispered breathlessly.</t1456>
<t1457>Mom drove me to school.</t1457> <t1458>I sat where Margo used to sit.</t1458> <t1459>Mom hardly said anything on the way, which was really good, because I fell asleep again, my head resting against the car window.</t1459>
<t1460>When Mom stopped in front of the school, I saw that the spot where Margo usually parked was empty.</t1460> <t1461>Actually, you can't blame her for being late.</t1461> <t1462>Margo's friends don't gather as early as my friends do.</t1462>
<t1463>I walked towards the bunch of rowdy guys in the band when Ben suddenly shouted, "Jacobsen, did I dream last night or did you–" I signaled to him with the slightest shake of my head, and he immediately changed his tone mid-sentence–"and I traveled through the Pacific Islands, drifting on a yacht made of bananas, didn't I?"</t1463>
<t1464>“The food on that yacht must be delicious,” I replied.</t1464> <t1465>Radar raised his eyebrows at me and leisurely walked into the shade of a tree.</t1465> <t1466>I followed him. “I asked Angela to find a match for Ben. No luck.” I glanced at Ben, that monkey was chattering away, a coffee stirrer bouncing in his mouth with every word.</t1466>
<t1467>"So boring," I said.</t1467> <t1468>"But that's okay too.</t1468> <t1469>It and I will hang out together and have a marathon session of playing Resurrection, something like that."</t1469>
<t1470>Ben darted in and blurted out, "Are you guys up to some refined mischief or what?"</t1470> <t1471>"I know full well you're talking about the tragic bunny-hop dance of my life." He turned sharply and went inside.</t1471> <t1472>Radar and I followed, chatting as we walked past the music room, where the ninth and tenth graders were gossiping amidst a mess of instrument cases.</t1472> <t1473>"Why are you so keen on it?" I asked.</t1473>
<t1474>“The senior prom, man.</t1474> <t1475>My last perfect chance to create the most heart-throbbing memory of my school life with a sweet, innocent girl.” I listened with my eyes wide open.</t1475>
<t1476>The first bell signaled that there were five minutes left until class started.</t1476> <t1477>Immediately, like Pavlov's dogs, everyone began to move quickly, crowding the hallway.</t1477> <t1478>Ben, Radar, and I stood next to Radar's locker.</t1478> <t1479>"Why the heck did you call me at three in the morning asking for Chuck Parson's address?"</t1479>
<t1480>I was racking my brain to come up with the most satisfactory answer when I suddenly saw Chuck Parson approaching.</t1480> <t1481>I nudged Ben and glanced towards Chuck.</t1481> <t1482>As a consequence of last night's event, Chuck had decided that the most effective strategy was to shave his left side clean. "Oh my god," Ben's jaw dropped.</t1482>
<t1483>Immediately, Chuck was looming in front of me as I leaned against the locker, his smooth forehead looking quite appealing.</t1483> <t1484>"What are you damn bastards looking at?"</t1484>
<t1485>“What are you looking at,” Radar replied. “It's as sure as corn that we weren't looking at your eyebrows.”</t1485> <t1486>Chuck pushed Radar away, spread his hand, and slammed it against the locker next to me, then walked off straight away.</t1486>
<t1487>"Your work?" Ben asked, eyes wide with surprise.</t1487>
<t1488>"You are forbidden from gossiping," I told both of them, then quietly added, "about me and Margo Roth Spiegelman."</t1488><t1489>"</t1489>
<t1490>Ben's voice immediately rose with enthusiasm, "Last night you were with Margo Roth Spiegelman? At THREE IN THE MORNING?" I nodded. "Just the two of you?" I nodded.</t1490> <t1491>"Oh my God, if you hooked up with her, you have to tell me every single detail of what happened.</t1491> <t1492>You have to write me an essay about Margo Roth Spiegelman's two natural wonders, how they look, how they feel, at least thirty pages long!"</t1492>
<t1493>“I want you to draw a graphite picture in the style of three-dimensional photorealism,” Radar said.</t1493>
<t1494>"Sculpting statues is always an option," Ben added.</t1494>
<t1495>Radar tentatively raised his hand, so I had to let him speak.</t1495> <t1496>"Uh, I was wondering if you could write a sestina about Margo's breasts?</t1496> <t1497>The six words to rhyme with are: pink, round, firm, soft, smooth, and gentle."</t1497>
<t1498>“Personally, I think,” Ben interjected, “at least one of the six words to rhyme should be buhbuhbuhbuh.”</t1498>
<t1499>"It seems like I have never heard or read that word before," I said.</t1499>
<t1500>"That is the sound my mouth makes when I present the Copyrighted Super Speedy Ben to a young bunny." At this point, Ben pretended to perform as he would in the rare situation of being able to admire a natural wonder.</t1500>
<t1501>“Right now,” I said, “thousands of girls across America are feeling a chilling fear and disgust creeping up their spines, even though they have no idea why.</t1501> <t1502>In fact, I did not bite Margo, you guys just have a twisted imagination.</t1502><t1503>”</t1503>
<t1504>“Here is the model,” Ben said arrogantly.</t1504> <t1505>“To my knowledge, I am the only guy with a pair of eggs ready to offer a young bunny whatever she wants, and at the same time, the only guy who has no chance to fulfill that wish.</t1505><t1506>”</t1506>
<t1507>“What a miraculous coincidence,” I commented.</t1507> <t1508>Life is still the same as it always has been—just with an added feeling of fatigue.</t1508> <t1509>I had hoped that last night would change my life, but nothing has changed—at least not yet.</t1509>
<t1510>The second bell rang.</t1510> <t1511>We hurriedly pulled each other into the classroom.</t1511>
<t1512>I started feeling utterly exhausted during the first period of calculus.</t1512> <t1513>In fact, I had felt weary since waking up, but combining that fatigue with calculus seemed somewhat unfair.</t1513> <t1514>To stay awake, I scribbled a few lines for Margo—there was no way I would ever send them to her, just a summary of my favorite moments from the previous night—yet my eyes were still drooping shut.</t1514> <t1515>At some point, I couldn't even hold my pen anymore, my field of vision kept narrowing, narrowing, and I racked my brain to recall if tunnel vision was a symptom of exhaustion.</t1515> <t1516>I figured it must be, because the only person I could see in front of me was Mr. Jiminez at the blackboard.</t1516> <t1517>Perhaps this was the only information my brain could process, so when Mr. Jiminez said, "Quentin?", I was extremely confused.</t1517> <t1518>The only thing happening in my universe was Mr. Jiminez writing something on the board, and I couldn't understand how he could exist in my life in both audible and visible forms like that.</t1518>
<t1519>“Yes?” I asked again.</t1519>
<t1520>"Can you hear the question?"</t1520>
<t1521>“Yes?” I asked again.</t1521>
<t1522>“Did you raise your hand to answer?” I looked up, indeed my hand was raised, but I had no idea how it got there, and it seemed like I only slightly knew what to do to reverse that action.</t1522> <t1523>Then with considerable effort, my brain finally told my arm to lower, the arm obeyed, and finally I said, “May I go to the restroom?”</t1523>
<t1524>The teacher said, "Just go," then someone in the class raised their hand to answer some question about some type of differential equation.</t1524>
<t1525>I went into the bathroom, splashed water on my face, then leaned on the sink, got close to the mirror, and scrutinized my face.</t1525> <t1526>I tried rubbing my bloodshot eyes but it didn't help at all.</t1526> <t1527>And then I came up with a brilliant idea.</t1527> <t1528>I went into a stall, closed the toilet lid, sat on it, leaned against the wall, and slept.</t1528> <t1529>The sleep lasted about sixteen milliseconds before the bell for the second period rang.</t1529> <t1530>I got up and went to Latin class, then physics. Finally, it was the fourth period, I caught up with Ben in the cafeteria and said, “I really need to take a nap or something.”</t1530>
<t1531>“Let's have lunch with RHAPAW,” Ben replied.</t1531>
<t1532>RHAPAW was a fifteen-year-old Buick, which Ben's three older siblings had driven carefree year after year.</t1532> <t1533>By the time it came into Ben's possession, RHAPAW's main structure was duct tape and putty.</t1533> <t1534>Its full name was "Rồ Hơi Ả Pắn Ả Wa," abbreviated to RHAPAW for short.</t1534> <t1535>It didn't run on gasoline but on an eternal fuel called "the hope of humanity."</t1535> <t1536>Just sit on the burning hot nylon seat and hope it would run, then Ben would turn the key, the engine would start up and down a few times, like a fish on land flailing its last desperate kicks before dying.</t1536> <t1537>So you had to hope even more intensely, and the engine would come back to life a few more times.</t1537> <t1538>Hope again, and finally, it would take a breath.</t1538>
<t1539>Ben started RHAPAW and turned on the air conditioner at full power.</t1539> <t1540>Three out of four windows couldn't even open, but the air conditioner ran cool, although for the first few minutes it only blew hot air, mixing with the stifling hot atmosphere inside the car.</t1540> <t1541>I stretched out on the back seat, almost lying flat, and I told Ben everything: Margo at my window, Wal-Mart, the revenge plot, the SunTrust building, breaking into the wrong house, SeaWorld, and the I'll-miss-hanging-out-with-you moment.</t1541>
<t1542>Ben didn't interrupt at all–he's a good friend in the sense that he knows when not to interrupt–but as soon as I finished speaking, he immediately asked the pressing question on his mind.</t1542>
<t1543>“About Jase Worthington, how small did you say he was?”</t1543>
<t1544>“Sun could be a contributing factor, because at that time the boy was extremely stressed, but have you ever seen a pencil?” I asked, and Ben nodded.</t1544> <t1545>“Well, have you ever seen the eraser attached to the end of the pencil?” Ben nodded again. “Well, have you ever seen the tiny eraser shavings left on the paper when you erase something?” Another nod.</t1545> <t1546>“I think the length is about three shavings, the width about one shaving,” I concluded.</t1546> <t1547>Ben had to endure a lot of pranks from guys like Jase Worthington and Chuck Parson, so I thought he deserved a little bit of fun.</t1547> <t1548>But Ben didn't even laugh.</t1548> <t1549>He just slowly shook his head, looking bewildered.</t1549>
<t1550>"Oh my God, Margo is really skillful."</t1550>
<t1551>"I know."</t1551>
<t1552>“Margo is the type of person who is ready to bid farewell to life in a glorious manner at the age of twenty-seven, like Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin, or grow up to conquer, what could it be, the first Nobel Prize for Outstanding Individual, for example.”</t1552>
<t1553>“Yes,” I replied.</t1553> <t1554>I almost never get tired of talking about Margo Roth Spiegelman, but I was almost never as exhausted as I was at that moment.</t1554> <t1555>I leaned back against the cracked nylon seat and immediately fell asleep.</t1555> <t1556>When I woke up, I found a Wendy’s hamburger bag on my lap with a note.</t1556> <t1557>I have to go to class, see you after band practice.</t1557>
<t1558>After the last class of that day, I translated Ovid while leaning against the honeycomb wall outside the music room, trying to ignore the cacophonous sounds emanating from within.</t1558> <t1559>I always hung around school until the music practice was over, because leaving before Ben and Radar meant enduring the unbearable scorn of being the only senior on the bus.</t1559>
<t1560>Leaving the gym, Ben dropped Radar off at his house, right next to the "navel of the village" Jefferson Park, near Lacey's house.</t1560> <t1561>Then he took me home.</t1561> <t1562>I noticed that Margo's car wasn't parked in her driveway either.</t1562> <t1563>So she wasn't skipping school to sleep at home.</t1563> <t1564>Margo wasn't coming to school because she was busy with another adventure—a non-Quentin adventure.</t1564> <t1565>Maybe she spent the whole day smearing hair removal cream on the pillows of other enemies, or something like that.</t1565> <t1566>As I walked into the house, I felt left out, but of course, Margo knew I would never join her again—I prioritized a day at school too much.</t1566> <t1567>Who knows, maybe it was just a day for Margo.</t1567> <t1568>Maybe she took another three-day trip to Mississippi, or wandered off with a circus troupe.</t1568> <t1569>But of course, reality wasn't any of the above scenarios.</t1569>
<t1570>But it is something I cannot imagine, because how could I possibly be Margo.</t1570>
<t1571>I wonder what she will bring home this time.</t1571> <t1572>And I wonder if she will tell me when the two of us sit across from each other having lunch.</t1572> <t1573>Maybe, I think, this is what Margo meant when she said she would miss the times playing with me.</t1573> <t1574>She knew that she already had a place to go, to temporarily escape the dull, paper-like monotony of Orlando.</t1574> <t1575>But when will Margo come back? Who knows.</t1575> <t1576>She didn't want to spend the last weeks of high school with her longtime friends, so maybe she will end up wanting to spend time with me.</t1576>
<t1577>It didn't take long for rumors to spread once Margo disappeared.</t1577> <t1578>That evening, after dinner, Ben called me.</t1578> <t1579>"I heard that Margo isn't answering her phone.</t1579> <t1580>Someone on Facebook said that Margo mentioned she was moving to a secret storage room in Tomorrowland at Disney."</t1580>
<t1581>"Nonsense," I said.</t1581>
<t1582>“I know, Tomorrowland is the weirdest of all the Lands.</t1582> <t1583>Someone even said Margo met a guy online.”</t1583>
<t1584>"Nonsense," I snapped.</t1584>
<t1585>“Okay, fine, but so what?”</t1585>
<t1586>“Margo is somewhere on her own, experiencing the kind of fun that we can only imagine,” I said.</t1586>
<t1587>Ben giggled.</t1587> <t1588>"You mean Margo played by herself?"</t1588>
<t1589>I groaned. "Stop it, Ben. Margo is doing things in Margo's style.</t1589> <t1590>Weaving stories.</t1590> <t1591>Shaking worlds.</t1591><t1592>"</t1592>
<t1593>That night, I lay on my side, gazing out the window into the invisible world outside.</t1593> <t1594>I tried to sleep, but then my eyes would snap open, just to check.</t1594> <t1595>I couldn't help but hope that Margo Roth Spiegelman would come back to the window and drag my exhausted self on another unforgettable adventure.</t1595>
<t1596>2.</t1596>
<t1597>Occasionally, Margo would disappear, so there wouldn't be any Find Margo campaigns at school or anything like that, but we all felt her absence.</t1597> <t1598>High school is not a democracy or a dictatorship—nor is it a chaotic state as many people mistakenly believe.</t1598> <t1599>High school is a monarchy that worships its queen.</t1599> <t1600>So when the queen goes on vacation, things immediately go awry.</t1600> <t1601>Specifically, everything starts to get chaotic and deteriorate.</t1601> <t1602>For instance, during the time Margo was off to Mississippi in tenth grade, Becca leaked the story of Ben the Bloody to the entire world.</t1602> <t1603>This time, it would be the same old scenario.</t1603> <t1604>The girl who saved the dike with her finger was gone.</t1604> <t1605>Flooding was inevitable.</t1605>
<t1606>That morning, I got to school on time and hitched a ride with Ben. We noticed that everyone was unusually quiet outside the music room.</t1606> <t1607>"Hey man," Frank from the group said in a very serious tone.</t1607>
<t1608>"What's going on?"</t1608>
<t1609>"Chuck Parson, Taddy Mac, and Clint Bauer got into Clint's Tahoe and ran over twelve bicycles belonging to the ninth and tenth graders."</t1609>
<t1610>"Oh my goodness," I shook my head and exclaimed.</t1610>
<t1611>Ashley added, "That's not all, yesterday someone put our phone number on the wall of the men's restroom with... hmm... some very unsanitary comments.</t1611><t1612>"</t1612>
<t1613>I shook my head again and joined the silence with them.</t1613> <t1614>We couldn't expose those guys; back in middle school, we had tried many times, and the inevitable consequence was that the punishments for us kept piling up.</t1614> <t1615>Usually, we would wait until someone like Margo reminded them of how utterly foolish and stupid they were.</t1615>
<t1616>But Margo had unveiled to me how to resist those old tricks of bullying the newcomers, the strong preying on the weak.</t1616> <t1617>I was about to speak when I suddenly caught sight of a large figure running at full speed towards us.</t1617> <t1618>He was wearing a black ski mask and carrying a huge, menacing green water gun.</t1618> <t1619>As he rushed past, he bumped into my shoulder, causing me to lose my balance and fall sideways onto the rough concrete. "If you mess with us, you'll get what's coming to you." I couldn't recognize whose voice it was.</t1619>
<t1620>Ben and another kid from the group helped me stand up.</t1620> <t1621>My shoulder ached, but I didn't want to test it. "Are you okay?" Radar asked.</t1621>
<t1622>“It's okay,” I replied, starting to massage my shoulders.</t1622>
<t1623>Radar shook his head. "Someone needs to tell that guy that you can get hit, you can also hit, but you can't get hit." I laughed.</t1623> <t1624>Someone nodded towards the parking lot, I looked over and saw two ninth graders walking around, their baggy t-shirts wet on their skinny frames.</t1624>
<t1625>“That’s urine, guys!” one boy shouted at us.</t1625> <t1626>The other boy said nothing, just tried to hold his shirt sleeve away, which seemed to help a bit.</t1626> <t1627>I saw streaks of liquid snaking down his arm from the sleeve.</t1627>
<t1628>“Is this the urine of an animal or a person?” someone asked.</t1628>
<t1629>"How would I know! Am I supposed to be a urine expert or something?"</t1629>
<t1630>I walked over to the ninth grader, placed my hand on his head, the only spot that seemed completely dry. "We will sort this out," I said.</t1630>
<t1631>The second bell rang, Radar and I rushed into calculus class.</t1631> <t1632>As I slid into my seat, I accidentally hit my elbow, pain shooting up to my shoulder.</t1632> <t1633>Radar tapped on his notebook, on the page he had written and circled: How's the shoulder?</t1633>
<t1634>I wrote on the corner of my notebook: Compared to those two new soldiers, I had a morning frolicking with a litter of puppies under the rainbows.</t1634>
<t1635>Radar chuckled softly, enough for Mr. Jiminez to shoot him a glance.</t1635> <t1636>I continued writing, I have a plan, but I need to know who the mastermind is first.</t1636>
<t1637>Radar rewrote, Jasper Hanson, and circled the name several times.</t1637> <t1638>What a surprise.</t1638> <t1639>How did you know?</t1639>
<t1640>Radar continued, "Don't you recognize him?"</t1640> <t1641>"That idiot is always wearing his uniform."</t1641>
<t1642>Jasper Hanson is in the eleventh grade.</t1642> <t1643>I always thought he was harmless, even likable–the kind of kid who says "Hey buddy, what's up?" Not the kind who would dare to spray urine all over the ninth graders.</t1643> <t1644>Honestly, in the bureaucratic system of Winter Park High School, Jasper Hanson holds the rank of Assistant Deputy Undersecretary of Sports and Pranks.</t1644> <t1645>When a guy like this gets promoted to Vice President in charge of Urinary Tract Weaponry, urgent action is required.</t1645>
<t1646>That afternoon, when I got home, I created an email account and wrote to my long-time friend Jason Worthington.</t1646>
<t1647>From: mavenger@gmail.</t1647> <t1648>com</t1648>
<t1649>To: jworthington90@yahoo.</t1649> <t1650>com</t1650>
<t1651>Topic: You, Me, Becca Arrington's House, Your Dream, etc...</t1651>
<t1652>Dear Worthington,</t1652>
<t1653>1. 200 dollars in cash need to be given to each of the 12 students whose bicycles were crushed under the wheels of your Chevy Tahoe by you and your classmates.</t1653> <t1654>This amount should not be an issue, considering your ample wealth.</t1654>
<t1655>2.</t1655> <t1656>The act of writing graffiti in the men's restroom must be stopped.</t1656>
<t1657>3.</t1657> <t1658>Water guns? Peeing? Really? Come on, guys, be serious.</t1658>
<t1659>4.</t1659> <t1660>You need to behave kindly towards the students in the school, especially those who are less fortunate socially than you.</t1660>
<t1661>5.</t1661> <t1662>You might also need to remind your younger associates to behave in a similarly mature and proper manner.</t1662>
<t1663>I realize that some of the tasks above will be very difficult to complete.</t1663> <t1664>But once again, not sharing the attached photo with the whole world is also a very difficult thing to do.</t1664>
<t1665>Dear,</t1665>
<t1666>Your Friendly Avenger</t1666>
<t1667>The response appeared twelve minutes later.</t1667>
<t1668>Listen here Quentin, yes, I know it's you.</t1668> <t1669>You know it wasn't me who sprayed the new soldiers.</t1669> <t1670>Sorry, but I can't control the actions of others.</t1670>
<t1671>I replied:</t1671>
<t1672>Mr. Worthington,</t1672>
<t1673>I understand that you don't control Chuck and Jasper.</t1673> <t1674>But you see, I'm in a similar situation.</t1674> <t1675>I don't manage the little devil sitting on my left shoulder.</t1675> <t1676>That little devil is screaming, "PRINT THE PICTURES PRINT THE PICTURES POST THEM ALL OVER THE SCHOOL DO IT NOW DO IT NOW DO IT NOW."</t1676> <t1677>And then on my right shoulder, there's a tiny white angel, whispering, "Oh my, I have a firm hope as solid as waste that by early Monday morning the new recruits will get their money properly."</t1677>
<t1678>Me too, little angel.</t1678> <t1679>I hope so too.</t1679>
<t1680>Best wishes,</t1680>
<t1681>Your Friendly Avenger</t1681>
<t1682>He did not answer, and he did not need to.</t1682> <t1683>Everything was laid out clearly.</t1683>
<t1684>After dinner, Ben dropped by and we played Resurrection, pausing every half hour to call Radar, who was on a date with Angela. We sent Radar eleven messages, each one more suggestive and provocative than the last.</t1684> <t1685>Past nine in the evening, the doorbell rang.</t1685> <t1686>“Quentin!” my mom called.</t1686> <t1687>Ben and I guessed that Radar had arrived, so we took a break from the game and went to the living room together.</t1687> <t1688>Chuck Parson and Jason Worthington were standing at my doorstep.</t1688> <t1689>I approached, and Jason said, “Hi, Quentin,” to which I nodded.</t1689> <t1690>Jason glanced at Chuck, and he looked at me, mumbling, “Sorry, Quentin.”</t1690>
<t1691>“For what reason?” I asked.</t1691>
<t1692>“Because I urged Jasper to shoot the water gun at the ninth graders,” he continued to mumble, pausing before finishing, “And because of the bikes.”</t1692>
<t1693>Ben stretched out his arms as if wanting to hug, "Brother, come here," he said.</t1693>
<t1694>"What?"</t1694>
<t1695>“Come here,” it repeated.</t1695> <t1696>Chuck stepped forward, “Closer,” Ben said.</t1696> <t1697>Chuck was now completely inside my house, about a foot away from Ben.</t1697> <t1698>Suddenly, Ben punched Chuck in the stomach. Chuck wasn't hurt at all, but he immediately stepped back to get ready to hit Ben. However, Jase held his hand.</t1698> <t1699>“Calm down, man,” Jase said.</t1699> <t1700>“Doesn't seem like it hurt.” Jase extended his hand for a shake, “I like your resilience, buddy,” he said.</t1700> <t1701>“You're a pain, but I like you.”</t1701> <t1702>I shook Jase's hand.</t1702>
<t1703>Then those two guys left in Jase's Lexus, reversing down the road.</t1703> <t1704>I had just closed the front door when Ben let out a stream of groans, "Ahhhhhhhhggg."</t1704> <t1705>"Oh sweet Lord, my hand." He tried to clench his hand and his face twisted as if it were torn.</t1705> <t1706>"Chuck Parson must have shielded himself with a thick textbook."</t1706>
<t1707>"That's called abdominal muscles, sir," I said.</t1707>
<t1708>“Oh, right.</t1708> <t1709>I've heard about it too.” I patted its back and we both went back to my room to play Resurrection.</t1709> <t1710>We had just started playing again when Ben said, “Hey, did you hear Jase say 'comrade'?</t1710> <t1711>I decline that comrade title.</t1711> <t1712>Only with the impulse from my own magic.”</t1712>
<t1713>“Yeah, on Friday night he played video games and bandaged his ruined hand because he foolishly thought he could land a single punch to someone's stomach.</t1713> <t1714>No wonder Jase Worthington had to humbly lower himself before him.”</t1714>
<t1715>"When all is said and done, I am a Resurrection superstar," Ben said, immediately shooting me in the back even though we were playing in team mode.</t1715>
<t1716>We played for a while longer, until Ben curled up on the floor, clutching the game controller to his chest, and fell fast asleep.</t1716> <t1717>I was tired too—it had been a long day.</t1717> <t1718>I was sure Margo would be back by Monday, but even so, I felt a bit proud of being the one to hold back the tide of monotony.</t1718>
<t1719>3.</t1719>
<t1720>Now every morning when I wake up, I look out the window of my room to see if there are any signs that someone is in Margo's room.</t1720> <t1721>She usually lowers the bamboo blinds, but since Margo hasn't been home, her mother or someone else has pulled the blinds up, so I can see a patch of blue wall and a white ceiling.</t1721> <t1722>That Saturday morning, Margo had only been missing for forty-eight hours, so I guessed she probably wouldn't be back right away.</t1722> <t1723>Even so, I still felt a bit of disappointment when I saw the neatly rolled-up bamboo blinds.</t1723>
<t1724>After kicking Ben a few times and he still wouldn't get up, I brushed my teeth, put on shorts and a t-shirt, and left the room.</t1724> <t1725>There were five people sitting at the dining table.</t1725> <t1726>My parents.</t1726> <t1727>Margo's parents.</t1727> <t1728>And a tall, well-built African man, wearing large glasses, a gray suit, and holding a briefcase.</t1728>
<t1729>“Oh, hello everyone,” I said.</t1729>
<t1730>"Quentin," my mom asked me, "did you see your friend Margo on Wednesday night?"</t1730>
<t1731>I went straight into the dining room and stood leaning against the wall, facing the strange guest.</t1731> <t1732>I had already planned how to answer this question. "Yes," I replied. "Around midnight, he stood by my window, we talked for about a minute, then Mr. Spiegelman called and he went home."</t1732>
<t1733>“Is that all? Did you see him again after that?” Uncle Spiegelman asked, looking quite calm.</t1733>
<t1734>"No." </t1734><t1735>"What's the matter?" I asked.</t1735>
<t1736>Margo's mother answered.</t1736> <t1737>“It looks like she has run away from home.”</t1737> <t1738>“Once again.” She sighed.</t1738> <t1739>“This is–how many times now, Josh, the fourth time, right?”</t1739>
<t1740>“Oh, there are too many to remember,” Margo's dad replied grumpily.</t1740>
<t1741>Then the man of color spoke up.</t1741> <t1742>“This is the fifth time you have reported.”</t1742> <t1743>He nodded to me and said, “I am Detective Otis Warren.”</t1743>
<t1744>"I am Quentin Jacobsen," I introduced myself.</t1744>
<t1745>Mom stood up and placed her hands on Ms. Spiegelman's shoulders. "Debbie," she said, "I'm so sorry.</t1745> <t1746>This must be so exhausting for you." I knew my mom's trick all too well.</t1746> <t1747>It's a technique in psychology called empathetic listening and understanding.</t1747> <t1748>You articulate the feelings of the person you're talking to so that they feel heard.</t1748> <t1749>Mom uses this trick on me all the time.</t1749>
<t1750>“I am not tired or exhausted at all,” Ms. Spiegelman replied.</t1750> <t1751>“I am really fed up.”</t1751>
<t1752>“That's right,” Mr. Spiegelman agreed.</t1752> <t1753>“We have an appointment with the locksmith this afternoon.</t1753> <t1754>We will change all the locks.</t1754> <t1755>He's eighteen now.</t1755> <t1756>The detective also just said that we can't do anyth</t1756><t1757>ing–”</t1757>
<t1758>“Ahem,” Detective Warren interrupted, “I didn't exactly say that.</t1758> <t1759>I said that Margo is not a missing minor, meaning she has the right to leave home.</t1759><t1760>”</t1760>
<t1761>Uncle Spiegelman continued talking to my mother. "My wife and I are willing to pay for her to go to college, but we cannot tolerate... such foolishness."</t1761> <t1762>"Connie, my daughter is eighteen years old! And yet she is still selfish and does whatever she wants!"</t1762> <t1763>"She needs to experience some consequences."</t1763>
<t1764>My mother lifted her hand off Ms. Spiegelman's shoulder.</t1764> <t1765>"I think the girl needs to experience the consequences of loving affection," my mother said.</t1765>
<t1766>"Oh Connie, it's not your child.</t1766> <t1767>It hasn't visited you in almost ten years.</t1767> <t1768>My family still has another one to take care of."</t1768>
<t1769>“And us too,” Uncle Spiegelman added, then turned to me.</t1769> <t1770>“Quentin, I'm sorry if Margo has dragged you into her nonsense.</t1770> <t1771>Do you understand... how embarrassed we are about this.</t1771> <t1772>You are a serious boy, and she... oh.”</t1772>
<t1773>I no longer lean against the wall but stand upright.</t1773> <t1774>I have a vague understanding of Margo's parents, but I have never seen them behave so poorly.</t1774> <t1775>No wonder Margo was angry with her parents on Wednesday night.</t1775> <t1776>I glance at the inspector, who is flipping through the pages of the file. "Margo has always left some breadcrumbs as a sign, hasn't she?"</t1776>
<t1777>“The clues,” Mr. Spiegelman said, standing up.</t1777> <t1778>The detective placed the file on the table, and Margo's father leaned in to look at it.</t1778> <t1779>“Clues are everywhere.</t1779> <t1780>On the day she left for Mississippi, she ate alphabet soup and left exactly four letters in the bowl: M, I, S, and P. She was disappointed when we didn't put those letters together, even though when she finally came home, I said: ‘How could we find you knowing only Mississippi?</t1780> <t1781>Margo, that's a huge state!’”</t1781>
<t1782>The inspector cleared his throat.</t1782> <t1783>"And Margo left the Minnie Mouse plush toy on the bed when she stayed a night at Disney World."</t1783>
<t1784>“That's right,” Margo's mother said.</t1784> <t1785>“The clues.</t1785> <t1786>The stupid clues.</t1786> <t1787>The clues that lead nowhere, trust me.</t1787><t1788>”</t1788>
<t1789>The detective looked up from his notebook and spoke.</t1789> <t1790>“Of course, we will get to the bottom of this, but we can't force Margo to come back right away.</t1790> <t1791>For now, you shouldn't expect her to return home.</t1791><t1792>”</t1792>
<t1793>“I don't want to see her face at home anymore.” Ms. Spiegelman lifted a tissue to dab at her eyes, but I didn't hear any sobbing in her voice.</t1793> <t1794>“I know it's terrible, but it's true.”</t1794>
<t1795>"Sister Deb," my mother said in a therapist's voice.</t1795>
<t1796>Ms. Spiegelman just shook her head—the slightest shake.</t1796> <t1797>"What could my husband and I do?</t1797> <t1798>We reported it to the detective.</t1798> <t1799>We made a report.</t1799> <t1800>She's grown up now, Connie.</t1800><t1801>"</t1801>
<t1802>“It is your eldest child,” my mother said, still keeping a calm voice.</t1802>
<t1803>“Oh, come on Connie.</t1803> <t1804>You see, if we consider Margo leaving home a blessing, is that so bad? Of course, it's bad.</t1804> <t1805>But Margo is a disease in my house! How can you find someone who declares that no one will find them, someone who always leaves clues that lead nowhere, someone who runs away from home at the slightest provocation?</t1805> <t1806>You can't find that!”</t1806>
<t1807>My parents glanced at each other, then the detective spoke to me.</t1807> <t1808>“Son, can we talk privately for a bit?” I nodded.</t1808> <t1809>The detective and I went into my parents' room, he sat on a folding chair while I sat on the edge of the bed.</t1809>
<t1810>"My child," he said as he sat comfortably in the chair, "let me give you this advice: never work for the government.</t1810> <t1811>Because when you work for the government, you have to serve the people.</t1811> <t1812>And when you serve the people, you have to interact with others, even people like the Spiegelman couple." I smiled slightly.</t1812>
<t1813>“Let me be frank with you.</t1813> <t1814>That couple knows how to be parents just as much as I know how to diet.</t1814> <t1815>I've dealt with them before, and I don't like either of them.</t1815> <t1816>I don't care if you tell Margo's parents where she went or not, but I would appreciate it if you let me know.</t1816><t1817>”</t1817>
<t1818>"I don't know," I replied.</t1818> <t1819>"I really don't know, sir."</t1819>
<t1820>"Son, I've been thinking a lot about this girl Margo."</t1820> <t1821>"The things she does—like breaking into Disney World, right? She goes to Mississippi and leaves clues in a bowl of soup."</t1821> <t1822>"She organizes a large-scale campaign to cover houses with toilet paper."</t1822>
<t1823>"How did you know about that?" Two years ago, Margo had orchestrated a mission to cover two hundred houses with toilet paper in just one night.</t1823> <t1824>Needless to say, I wasn't invited to join in on the fun.</t1824>
<t1825>“I have been following that case.”</t1825> <t1826>“So, my boy, this is where I need your help: who planned all of this?”</t1826> <t1827>“These crazy coordinated attacks?”</t1827> <t1828>“That girl Margo is the spokesperson for all of it, the one crazy enough to do it all.”</t1828> <t1829>“But who calculated the plan?”</t1829> <t1830>“Who sat amidst the messy diagrams, figuring out how much toilet paper was needed to cover so many houses?”</t1830>
<t1831>"I guess they are all Margo."</t1831>
<t1832>“But surely the girl must have an accomplice, someone helping her carry out all these grand and daring things, and maybe that hidden person is not someone everyone knows, not Margo's best friend or boyfriend.</t1832> <t1833>It could be someone you wouldn't immediately think of.”</t1833> <t1834>He took a breath, about to continue, when I interrupted him.</t1834>
<t1835>"I don't know where Margo is," I said.</t1835> <t1836>"I swear to God.</t1836><t1837>"</t1837>
<t1838>"Just consider it carefully."</t1838> <t1839>"Anyway, you know something, don't you?"</t1839> <t1840>"So let's start from there." So I told him everything.</t1840> <t1841>I trusted this man.</t1841> <t1842>He took a few notes while I spoke, but nothing too detailed.</t1842> <t1843>And there was something in telling him, in the brief notes on the page, in the weariness of Margo's parents—something in all of it made me feel for the first time a gnawing sensation that Margo might be missing for a long time.</t1843> <t1844>Anxiety seemed to choke my breath as I stopped speaking.</t1844> <t1845>The detective was silent for a moment.</t1845> <t1846>He just leaned out of his chair, staring intently over my shoulder until he saw something he had been waiting to see, then he began to speak.</t1846>
<t1847>“Listen, son.</t1847> <t1848>This is how it goes: someone—usually a girl—has a free spirit and doesn't really get along with her parents.</t1848> <t1849>Those kids, they're like helium-filled balloons tied down.</t1849> <t1850>They rise up and want to break free from the string, and then something happens, the string snaps, and they drift away.</t1850> <t1851>You might never see that balloon again.</t1851> <t1852>It lands in Canada or somewhere, gets a job in a restaurant.</t1852> <t1853>And before the balloon realizes it, it's been serving coffee in that dingy café to those boring customers for thirty years.</t1853> <t1854>Or maybe in a few years, or a few days, strong winds bring the balloon back home because it needs money, or because it aches, it misses its little brother at home.</t1854> <t1855>But listen, the string keeps snapping all the time.”</t1855>
<t1856>“Yes, like–”</t1856>
<t1857>"I haven't finished speaking yet, son.</t1857> <t1858>The problem with balloons is that there are too many of them.</t1858> <t1859>The sky is crowded with balloons, they rub against each other as they drift from place to place, and each one of those damn balloons somehow ends up on my desk, and if this keeps happening, a man can get discouraged.</t1859> <t1860>Balloons everywhere, each with a mother or a father, or heaven forbid, both, and it keeps happening until you can't see each one anymore.</t1860> <t1861>You look up at the balloons in the sky, you see all those balloons, but you can't see each one clearly."</t1861> <t1862>He paused, taking a deep breath, as if realizing something.</t1862> <t1863>"But then, from there, anytime, when talking to some wide-eyed, tousle-haired kid, you don't want to tell him the truth because he looks like a good kid.</t1863> <t1864>And you suddenly feel sorry for the boy, because the only thing worse than the sky full of balloons you see is what the boy sees: a clear day broken by a single balloon.</t1864> <t1865>But son, once the string is cut, you can't reverse that.</t1865> <t1866>Do you understand what I've just said?"</t1866>
<t1867>I nodded, though I wasn't sure I understood.</t1867> <t1868>He stood up.</t1868> <t1869>“I think the girl will be back soon, son.</t1869> <t1870>If saying it like that makes you feel better.”</t1870>
<t1871>I like to imagine Margo as a balloon, but it seems that in the midst of the poetic surge just now, the detective saw through to a lot of worries within me, even more than the impulses I was actually feeling.</t1871> <t1872>I know Margo will come back.</t1872> <t1873>She will deflate and drift back to Jefferson Park. She always does.</t1873>
<t1874>I followed the detective back to the dining room, then he said he wanted to go to the Spiegelman house and take a look at Margo's room.</t1874> <t1875>Ms. Spiegelman hugged me and said, "You've always been a serious young man, I'm sorry that Margo dragged you into this ridiculous game." Mr. Spiegelman shook my hand, then they left.</t1875> <t1876>As soon as the door closed, my dad exclaimed, "Oh!"</t1876>
<t1877>"Oh!" my mother responded.</t1877>
<t1878>Dad put his arm around my shoulder. "Those were some very troublesome impulses just now, weren't they, my boy?"</t1878>
<t1879>"That couple stinks to high heaven," I said.</t1879> <t1880>My parents always found it amusing when I grumbled and cursed in front of them.</t1880> <t1881>I immediately saw the look of satisfaction on the faces of my creators.</t1881> <t1882>Openly cursing like that was a signal that I trusted my parents, that I was revealing myself in front of them.</t1882> <t1883>Even though that was indeed the case, my parents still looked somewhat sad.</t1883>
<t1884>"Margo's parents must have been deeply hurt in their pride when she behaved like that," Dad told me.</t1884>
<t1885>"That makes them unable to be effective parents," my mother added.</t1885>
<t1886>“They stink,” I repeated.</t1886>
<t1887>“To be honest,” Dad continued, “maybe they have a point.</t1887> <t1888>Maybe Margo needs everyone to pay attention to her.</t1888> <t1889>And God knows, I would need everyone to pay attention to me if those two were my parents.”</t1889>
<t1890>“When Margo comes back,” mother said, “she will be exhausted.</t1890> <t1891>Being abandoned like that!</t1891> <t1892>Being pushed away when she needed love the most.”</t1892>
<t1893>"When you come back, maybe Margo should just stay here," I said, and as I uttered those words, I realized it was indeed a brilliant idea.</t1893> <t1894>My mother raised her eyebrows slightly, but she immediately read something on my father's face, so she responded to me in her usual measured tone.</t1894>
<t1895>“Um, we certainly welcome Margo, though it is somewhat awkward—we are neighbors with the Spiegelmans.</t1895> <t1896>But when Margo returns to school, tell her that we welcome her to come here.</t1896> <t1897>If Margo doesn't want to stay at our house, there are still plenty of other suitable places we can comfortably consider.”</t1897>
<t1898>At that moment, Ben walked out, his messy hair defying all basic understanding of gravity's effect on matter.</t1898> <t1899>"Hello Mr. and Mrs. Jacobsen—always a pleasure to see you."</t1899>
<t1900>"Hello, Ben. We didn't know you were staying overnight."</t1900>
<t1901>"Actually, I don't know why either," Ben said.</t1901> <t1902>"What just happened?"</t1902>
<t1903>I told Ben about the detective and the Spiegelman couple, and that technically, Margo was a missing adult.</t1903> <t1904>When I finished, Ben nodded and said, “We should discuss this over a hot plate of Resurrection.” I laughed and followed him back to my room.</t1904> <t1905>Not long after, Radar arrived, and right then I was kicked off the team, because we were playing a difficult part, and despite the fact that I was the only one among the three of us who owned the game, my Resurrection skills were just average.</t1905> <t1906>I watched the two of them crash through a space station swarming with hideous cannibals.</t1906> <t1907>Ben yelled, “Dwarves, Radar, dwarves.”</t1907>
<t1908>"I see it now."</t1908>
<t1909>“Come here, you little lightweight,” Ben turned the control panel in his hand. “Daddy will lift you onto the boat for a trip on the River Styx.”</t1909>
<t1910>“You only cite Greek mythology for such trivial matters?” I asked.</t1910>
<t1911>Radar laughed with delight. Ben started frantically punching the control buttons, shouting all over the place, "Smash it, you little devil! Like Zeus smashed Metis!"</t1911>
<t1912>“I think maybe Margo will be back by Monday,” I said.</t1912> <t1913>“No one wants to skip school indefinitely, not even Margo Roth Spiegelman.</t1913> <t1914>Maybe she can stay here until graduation.”</t1914>
<t1915>Radar answered me somewhat distractedly because he was still playing Resurrection.</t1915> <t1916>"I don't even understand why Margo left, is it just that the goblin at six o'clock doesn't use the light gun because of a lack of affection?"</t1916> <t1917>"I thought Margo had already entombed somewhere, isn't it to the left, immune to things like that?"</t1917>
<t1918>"No," I said.</t1918> <t1919>"It's not like that, I don't think like you."</t1919> <t1920>Anyway, it's not just that.</t1920> <t1921>It seems like Margo hates Orlando; she calls this place a paper town.</t1921> <t1922>Like, you know, everything is fake, shoddy, and flimsy.</t1922> <t1923>I think she just wants a vacation to get away from it all."</t1923>
<t1924>Suddenly, I glanced out the window, and immediately I noticed that someone—possibly the detective—had lowered the curtain in Margo's room.</t1924> <t1925>But I wasn't looking at the curtain.</t1925> <t1926>Instead, I was looking at a black-and-white poster, pinned to the back of the curtain.</t1926> <t1927>In the picture, a man stood, shoulders slightly hunched, eyes looking straight ahead, lips gently holding a cigarette.</t1927>
<t1928>The guitar slung over the shoulder, and on the instrument, there was the phrase THIS MACHINE KILLS FASCISTS.</t1928>
<t1929>“There’s something on Margo’s window.”</t1929> <t1930>The game music stopped, and Radar and Ben crawled up on either side of me.</t1930> <t1931>“Is that new?” Radar asked.</t1931>
<t1932>“I have seen the back of that curtain a million times,” I replied, “but I have never seen that poster.”</t1932>
<t1933>“Strange, isn't it,” Ben said.</t1933>
<t1934>"This morning Margo's parents just said that she often leaves clues," I said.</t1934> <t1935>"But there has never been a clue solid enough to find Margo before she comes back on her own."</t1935>
<t1936>Radar immediately took out his handheld computer and looked up the phrase on the guitar in the Encyclopedia of Everything.</t1936> <t1937>“That picture is of Woody Guthrie,” he said.</t1937> <t1938>“A country music singer, born in 1912, died in 1967.</t1938> <t1939>Sang about the working class, ‘This Land Is Your Land.’</t1939> <t1940>Somewhat communist-leaning.</t1940> <t1941>Yeah, he was an inspiration to Bob Dylan.”</t1941> <t1942>Radar played a snippet of one of his songs—a high-pitched, gritty voice singing about unions.</t1942>
<t1943>“I will email the person who wrote most of this page to see if there is any specific connection between Woody Guthrie and Margo,” Radar said.</t1943>
<t1944>“I can't imagine that Margo likes his songs,” I said.</t1944>
<t1945>“Seriously,” Ben remarked, “he sings like Kermit the Frog drowning in booze and suffering from throat cancer.</t1945><t1946>”</t1946>
<t1947>Radar opened the window, stuck his head out, and looked around.</t1947> <t1948>"But it's as sure as corn that Margo left a signal for you, Q."</t1948> <t1949>"Well, does Margo know anyone else who could see that corner of the window?" I shook my head.</t1949>
<t1950>A moment later, Ben added, "The way he stared at us–like 'pay attention to me.'</t1950> <t1951>And his head like that, did you see?</t1951> <t1952>Not like a singer on stage, but as if he were standing at some kind of threshold."</t1952>
<t1953>“I think he wants us to go inside,” I said.</t1953>
<t1954>4.</t1954>
<t1955>From my room, I couldn't see the front door or the garage, so we needed to sit in the living room.</t1955> <t1956>Ben continued grinding Resurrection, while Radar and I went to the living room pretending to watch TV, constantly glancing out the window, keeping an eye on the Spiegelmans' front door, waiting for the moment Margo's parents went out.</t1956> <t1957>Detective Warren's black Crown Victoria was still parked in the driveway.</t1957>
<t1958>After about fifteen minutes, the detective left, but for an hour afterward, both the garage door and the front door remained tightly closed.</t1958> <t1959>Radar and I were watching a pretty funny comedy on HBO, I was starting to get into the movie when Radar said, "Garage door."</t1959> <t1960>I jumped off the sofa, went close to the window to see who was in the car.</t1960> <t1961>Both Mr. and Mrs. Spiegelman.</t1961> <t1962>Ruthie was still at home.</t1962> <t1963>"Ben!" I called out loudly.</t1963> <t1964>He immediately dashed out like a lightning bolt.</t1964> <t1965>When Mr. and Mrs. Spiegelman turned off Jefferson Way onto Jefferson Road, we left the house, rushing into the hot and humid outside air.</t1965>
<t1966>We walked across the lawn to the front door of the Spiegelman house.</t1966> <t1967>I rang the doorbell and heard the scratching of Myrna Mountweazel's claws on the wooden floor, then it started barking like crazy, staring at us through the glass strip.</t1967> <t1968>Ruthie came to open the door.</t1968> <t1969>She was a good girl, about eleven years old.</t1969>
<t1970>"Hello, Ruthie."</t1970>
<t1971>"Hello, Mr. Quentin," Ruthie said.</t1971>
<t1972>"Are your parents home?"</t1972>
<t1973>“My parents just left,” she replied, “they went to Target.”</t1973> <t1974>Ruthie also had big eyes like Margo, but they were a warm brown color.</t1974> <t1975>She looked at me, biting her lips anxiously.</t1975> <t1976>“Did you meet the police officer?”</t1976>
<t1977>“Yes, there is,” I replied.</t1977> <t1978>“He seems nice.</t1978><t1979>”</t1979>
<t1980>“My mom said to just consider that Margo went to college early.”</t1980>
<t1981>“Yes,” I replied, silently thinking that the simplest way to unravel a mystery is to decide that there is no mystery to unravel at all.</t1981> <t1982>But perhaps it was already clear that Margo had left clues leading to a mystery.</t1982>
<t1983>“Listen, Ruthie, we need to take a look at Margo's room for a bit,” I said.</t1983> <t1984>“But the problem is—it's like when Margo entrusted you with a top-secret mission.</t1984> <t1985>We're in a similar situation.”</t1985>
<t1986>“Sister Margo doesn't like others entering her room,”</t1986>
<t1987>Ruthie said.</t1987> <t1988>"Except for me."</t1988> <t1989>"Sometimes my mom too."</t1989>
<t1990>“But we are Margo's friends.”</t1990>
<t1991>“She doesn't like letting you into the room,” Ruthie insisted.</t1991>
<t1992>I bent down close to it.</t1992> <t1993>"I'm begging you."</t1993>
<t1994>“And you guys don't want me to tell Mom and Dad,” the little girl said.</t1994>
<t1995>“Exactly.”</t1995>
<t1996>“Five dollars,” Ruthie concluded.</t1996> <t1997>I was about to bargain, but Radar had already pulled out a five-dollar bill and handed it to her.</t1997> <t1998>“If I see any cars coming back, I'll let you know,” Ruthie said with a spirit of noble collusion.</t1998>
<t1999>I bent down to gently pat the elderly yet vigorous Myrna Mountweazel, and then we all went upstairs to Margo's room. As I placed my hand on the doorknob, I suddenly realized that I hadn't been in her room since I was ten years old.</t1999>
<t2000>I walked in.</t2000> <t2001>It was tidier than I imagined, but maybe that's because Margo's mom had just cleaned up.</t2001> <t2002>On the right, a closet was so stuffed with clothes that it looked like it was about to burst open.</t2002> <t2003>On the back of the door, there was a rack with about a dozen pairs of shoes, ranging from Mary Janes to high heels.</t2003> <t2004>It seemed like the closet wasn't missing much.</t2004>
<t2005>"I'll check the computer," Radar said.</t2005> <t2006>Ben tugged at the curtain.</t2006> <t2007>"The poster is stuck up," he said.</t2007> <t2008>"It's just regular tape.</t2008> <t2009>It's not like it's unremovable."</t2009>
<t2010>The big surprise was the wall next to the computer desk: a bookshelf as tall as me and twice as wide, filled with vinyl records.</t2010> <t2011>Hundreds of such records.</t2011> <t2012>"John Coltrane's ultimate love is in the record player," Ben said.</t2012>
<t2013>“Well, that's an excellent album,” Radar said, his eyes still glued to the computer.</t2013> <t2014>“Margo has quite the taste.”</t2014> <t2015>I didn't understand, so I looked at Ben, who explained, “John Coltrane is a saxophone player.” I nodded, now understanding.</t2015>
<t2016>While typing on the keyboard, Radar said, "I can't believe Q has never heard of Coltrane.</t2016> <t2017>Literally, Trane's saxophone is the most convincing proof I've ever known that God truly exists."</t2017>
<t2018>I started looking through the row of discs.</t2018> <t2019>All were arranged alphabetically and by artist name, so I searched the G section. Dizzy Gillespie, Jimmie Dale Gilmore, Green Day, Guided by Voices, George Harrison. "It seems like Margo has every musician and singer in the world except Woody Guthrie," I said.</t2019> <t2020>Then I turned back and started from the A section.</t2020>
<t2021>“All of Margo's textbooks are still here,” I heard Ben say.</t2021> <t2022>“There are a few more on the table next to the bed.</t2022> <t2023>No newspapers.”</t2023>
<t2024>But Margo's music collection attracted me more.</t2024> <t2025>She liked everything.</t2025> <t2026>I had never imagined that Margo had listened to all those old records.</t2026> <t2027>I had seen her listening to music while running, but I never suspected such a great passion.</t2027> <t2028>Most of the bands I had never heard of, and I found it strange that vinyl records were still being produced for new music.</t2028>
<t2029>I walked from A to B–through the Beatles, Blind Boys of Alabama, and Blondie–I started to skim faster, so fast that it seemed I didn't look at the back cover of Billy Bragg's Mermaid Avenue until I glanced at the Buzzcocks.</t2029> <t2030>I stopped, turned back, and pulled out the Billy Bragg record.</t2030> <t2031>The front cover showed a row of identical storefront buildings.</t2031> <t2032>But on the back, Woody Guthrie stared at me, a cigar dangling from his lips, with a guitar that had the words THIS MACHINE KILLS FASCISTS.</t2032>
<t2033>“Look,” I said.</t2033> <t2034>Ben looked over.</t2034>
<t2035>“Oh my goodness,” he exclaimed. “You have a knack for finding things.”</t2035> <t2036>Radar turned his chair around and said, “Very impressive.</t2036> <t2037>What's inside, I wonder?”</t2037>
<t2038>But unfortunately, there was only one record inside.</t2038> <t2039>The record looked exactly like a vinyl record.</t2039> <t2040>I placed it into Margo's record player, eventually figuring out how to turn it on and set the needle on the record.</t2040> <t2041>The voice of another singer sang Woody Guthrie's songs, sounding better than Woody Guthrie himself.</t2041>
<t2042>“What is this, could it just be a silly coincidence?”</t2042>
<t2043>Ben is holding the album cover.</t2043> <t2044>"Look," he says, pointing to the song list.</t2044> <t2045>The title "Walt Whitman's Niece" is circled with a thin black line.</t2045>
<t2046>“Interesting,” I said.</t2046> <t2047>Margo's mom said that Margo's clues never led anywhere, but now I know she had created a whole chain of clues–and it seems she left them for me.</t2047> <t2048>Immediately, I recalled the moment in the SunTrust building when Margo said I was better when I showed confidence.</t2048> <t2049>I flipped the record and turned it on.</t2049> <t2050>“Walt Whitman's Niece” was the first track on side two.</t2050> <t2051>It actually didn't sound bad.</t2051>
<t2052>Just then I saw Ruthie at the doorway.</t2052> <t2053>She looked at me. "Any clues for us, Ruthie?" She shook her head. "I've already looked," she said sadly.</t2053> <t2054>Radar looked at me and nodded towards Ruthie to signal.</t2054>
<t2055>"Can you look after your parents for us?" I asked.</t2055> <t2056>The little girl nodded and left.</t2056> <t2057>I closed the door.</t2057>
<t2058>“What is it?” I asked Radar. He waved us over to the computer.</t2058> <t2059>“In the week before she left, Margo spent quite a bit of time on Omnictionary. I know because of the number of minutes logged in under Margo's name, and she had saved the password on the computer.</t2059> <t2060>But Margo deleted all her search history, so we can't know what information she was looking for.”</t2060>
<t2061>"Hey, Radar, look up who Walt Whitman is," Ben said.</t2061>
<t2062>“That is a poet,” I replied.</t2062> <t2063>“Nineteenth century.</t2063><t2064>”</t2064>
<t2065>"Amazing," Ben exclaimed, eyes wide. "Poetry."</t2065>
<t2066>“Is something wrong?” I asked.</t2066>
<t2067>"Poetry only shatters the heart," Ben replied.</t2067> <t2068>"Oh, the pain.</t2068> <t2069>The pain.</t2069> <t2070>Falling endlessly, trembling.</t2070> <t2071>A fragment of my soul."</t2071>
<t2072>"Well, I'm sure that's Shakespeare's poetry," I said, not bothering with it.</t2072> <t2073>"Does Whitman have any nieces?" I turned to ask Radar.</t2073> <t2074>He was on the page about Whitman in the Encyclopedia of Everything. A burly man with a huge beard.</t2074> <t2075>I had never read Whitman, but he certainly looked the part of a poet.</t2075>
<t2076>“Well, no one famous.</t2076> <t2077>This says he had a few brothers, but it doesn't mention if they had children or not.</t2077> <t2078>I might be able to find this information if you want.” I shook my head.</t2078> <t2079>It doesn't seem like this is the direction.</t2079> <t2080>I stepped back and looked around the room.</t2080> <t2081>The bottom shelf of the record rack had a few books—various middle school yearbooks, a worn-out copy of The Outsiders—and some reprinted editions of teen magazines.</t2081> <t2082>Nothing related to Walt Whitman's niece, that's for sure.</t2082>
<t2083>I looked back at the books on the bedside table.</t2083> <t2084>Nothing noteworthy. "Margo must have one of his poetry books," I said.</t2084> <t2085>"But it seems like I can't find it."</t2085>
<t2086>"There is!" Ben exclaimed.</t2086> <t2087>I went to where he was kneeling by the bookshelf and saw the book.</t2087> <t2088>I had overlooked a thin volume on the bottom shelf, wedged between two yearbooks. Walt Whitman.</t2088> <t2089>Leaves of Grass.</t2089> <t2090>I pulled the book out.</t2090> <t2091>There was a photo of Whitman on the cover, his bright eyes staring intently at me.</t2091>
<t2092>"Not bad," I said to Ben.</t2092>
<t2093>It nodded.</t2093> <t2094>“Okay, can we get out of here now?</t2094> <t2095>Call me conservative, but I don't want Margo's parents to come back and find us hanging around here.”</t2095>
<t2096>"Is there anything missing?"</t2096>
<t2097>Radar stood up. "It seems clear that Margo has taken a rather coherent path, surely she will find something in the book."</t2097> <t2098>"It's strange," I said, "I don't mean anything by it, but if Margo always left clues for her parents, why did she leave them for you this time?"</t2098>
<t2099>I shrugged.</t2099> <t2100>I didn't have an answer, but of course, I held onto hope: maybe Margo wanted to see my confidence.</t2100> <t2101>Maybe this time she wanted to be found, and found by me.</t2101> <t2102>Maybe—just like she chose me on that longest night, this time she chose me again.</t2102> <t2103>And maybe the secret treasure is waiting for someone to find her.</t2103>
<t2104>Not long after I returned home, having looked through the book without finding any clear clues, Ben and Radar also came back.</t2104> <t2105>I took a serving of lasagna from the fridge for lunch and brought Walt back to my room.</t2105> <t2106>The book Leaves of Grass was a first edition published by Penguin Classics.</t2106> <t2107>I read a bit from the introduction and then continued flipping through the pages.</t2107> <t2108>There were some lines marked in blue, all of which were in a long, epic-like poem called "Song of Myself."</t2108> <t2109>Two lines in that poem were marked in green:</t2109>
<t2110>Unlock the lock from the door!</t2110>
<t2111>He removed the door from its frame!</t2111>
<t2112>I spent nearly the entire afternoon trying to understand the implication of that sentence, thinking to myself that perhaps it was Margo's way of telling me to be bolder or something like that.</t2112> <t2113>But I also read and reread each line of the poem marked in sky blue:</t2113>
<t2114>You will no longer receive from the second or third hand... no longer see through the eyes of the dead... no longer consume the haunting phantoms within the pages of books.</t2114>
<t2115>He embarked on an endless journey</t2115>
<t2116>Everything arises and spreads... and nothing contracts,</t2116>
<t2117>And death is not like what people imagine, and it brings additional blessings.</t2117>
<t2118>If no one else in this world attains enlightenment, I sit in peace, And if everyone attains enlightenment, I sit in peace.</t2118>
<t2119>The last three stanzas in the poem "Tự khúc" are also marked.</t2119>
<t2120>I return myself to the earth, nurturing the grasses I love. If you want me, look for me under your boots.</t2120>
<t2121>You will probably never know who I am, what I want to say, Nevertheless, I will always be the lifeblood of you, Filtering and capillarily conducting your blood.</t2121>
<t2122>If at first you cannot find me, stay determined and keep moving forward. If you lose my trace here, search for me elsewhere. Somewhere, I will stop and wait for you.</t2122>
<t2123>All weekend I just read, trying to find Margo in the pieces of poetry she left for me.</t2123> <t2124>Maybe the lines of poetry wouldn't lead me anywhere, but I thought about them anyway, because I didn't want to disappoint Margo.</t2124> <t2125>She wanted me to follow the thread, find where she had stopped and waited for me, follow the trail of breadcrumbs until it ended at Margo.</t2125>
<t2126>5.</t2126>
<t2127>Monday morning, an unusual event occurred.</t2127> <t2128>I was late for school, which was normal; my mom dropped me off at school, which was normal; I stood outside chatting with other kids, which was normal; then Ben and I went inside, which was also normal.</t2128> <t2129>But as soon as he pushed open the metal door, Ben's face turned into a chaotic mix of excitement and terror, as if a magician had just picked him out of the crowd to assist in a saw-through-the-body trick.</t2129> <t2130>Following Ben's gaze, I looked down the hallway.</t2130>
<t2131>Short denim skirt.</t2131> <t2132>Tight white t-shirt.</t2132> <t2133>Bare neck.</t2133> <t2134>Beautifully tanned skin.</t2134> <t2135>Legs that make people dream of legs.</t2135> <t2136>Perfect wavy brown hair.</t2136> <t2137>A shiny badge with the words CHOOSE ME AS PROM QUEEN. Lacey Pemberton. Walking towards us.</t2137> <t2138>Right next to the music room.</t2138>
<t2139>"Lacey Pemberton," Ben whispered, even though she was only three steps away from us and could clearly hear those words.</t2139> <t2140>In fact, a fake smile briefly appeared on Lacey's lips when she heard her name mentioned.</t2140>
<t2141>"Quentin," Lacey said to me, and above all, the fact that Lacey knew my name was an impossibility.</t2141> <t2142>She nodded her head to signal, and I followed Lacey through the music room, to the front of the row of personal lockers.</t2142> <t2143>Ben followed closely behind me.</t2143>
<t2144>"Hello Lacey," I said when she had stopped.</t2144> <t2145>I smelled Lacey's perfume, and I still remembered this scent in her SUV, remembered the crackling sound from the catfish when Margo and I pressed the car seat against it.</t2145> <t2146>"I heard you went with Margo." I just looked at Lacey.</t2146>
<t2147>“That night, and the fish? In my car?</t2147> <t2148>In Becca's room?</t2148> <t2149>And through Jase's window?”</t2149>
<t2150>I kept looking.</t2150> <t2151>I didn't know what to say.</t2151> <t2152>One can live a long life full of adventurous exploits without recounting it to Lacey Pemberton, but when that rare opportunity suddenly arises, one wouldn't want to speak carelessly.</t2152> <t2153>So Ben spoke up for me, “Yeah, it's those two.”</t2153> <t2154>Ben spoke as if Margo and I were very close.</t2154>
<t2155>"Is Margo really mad at me?" Lacey asked after a while.</t2155> <t2156>She lowered her eyes, and I could see her thick brown eyelashes.</t2156>
<t2157>"What?"</t2157>
<t2158>At that moment, Lacey spoke very softly, with tiny cracks in her voice, and immediately Lacey Pemberton was no longer Lacey Pemberton.</t2158> <t2159>She was just–like, an ordinary person.</t2159> <t2160>"You know, do you have any idea why Margo is so mad at me?"</t2160>
<t2161>For a moment, I thought about how to respond properly. "Well, Margo was a bit disappointed that you didn't tell her about Jase and Becca, but you know how Margo is.</t2161> <t2162>She'll get over it."</t2162>
<t2163>Lacey started walking down the hallway.</t2163> <t2164>Ben and I let her go, but then Lacey slowed down.</t2164> <t2165>She wanted us to go with her.</t2165> <t2166>Ben gently nudged me, and we went together.</t2166> <t2167>“I don't know anything about Jase and Becca.</t2167> <t2168>That's the problem.</t2168> <t2169>God, I hope I can explain to Margo soon.</t2169> <t2170>Sometimes I'm really afraid that maybe Margo has left for good, but I checked her locker because I know her combination, and I saw all her pictures, books, everything still there.”</t2170>
<t2171>"That's good," I said.</t2171>
<t2172>“Yeah, but it's been about four days already.</t2172> <t2173>That's almost a record for Margo.</t2173> <t2174>And you know what, there's this really annoying thing, because Craig knew about Jase and Becca, and I'm mad at him for not telling me, so I broke up with him.</t2174> <t2175>Now I've ruined my prom plans, my best friend is off somewhere only God knows, maybe New York or anywhere, still mad at me for something I NEVER did.”</t2175> <t2176>I squinted at Ben. Ben squinted back at me.</t2176>
<t2177>“I have to go to class,” I said.</t2177> <t2178>“But why did you say Margo is in New York?”</t2178>
<t2179>“It seems that two days before leaving, Margo told Jase that New York is the only place in America where one can truly live a halfway decent life.</t2179> <t2180>Maybe she was just speaking offhandedly.</t2180> <t2181>I don't know.”</t2181>
<t2182>“Alright, I have to run,” I said.</t2182>
<t2183>I know it's hard for Ben to invite Lacey to the prom, but at least he deserves a chance.</t2183> <t2184>I walked briskly down the hallway towards my locker, reaching out to ruffle Radar's hair as I passed by him.</t2184> <t2185>He was talking to Angela and a ninth-grade girl who also played in the band.</t2185> <t2186>"Don't thank me.</t2186> <t2187>Thank Q," I heard Radar say to the girl, and she exclaimed, "Thank you for the two hundred dollars!" Without looking back, I shouted, "Don't thank me, thank Margo Roth Spiegelman!" because of course she had given me the tool I needed.</t2187>
<t2188>I opened my locker, grabbed my calculus notebook, but I still stood there, even though the second bell had rung, standing still in the hallway while everyone around me zipped past in both directions, as if I were the divider on their highway.</t2188> <t2189>Another kid thanked me for the two hundred dollars he received.</t2189> <t2190>I smiled at the boy.</t2190> <t2191>I felt the school was more mine than ever in the past four years.</t2191> <t2192>We had found a fair solution for the bike-less class.</t2192> <t2193>Lacey Pemberton had talked to me. Chuck Parson had apologized.</t2193>
<t2194>I know these hallways all too well–and eventually, I even started to feel that they knew me.</t2194> <t2195>I was still standing there when the third bell rang and the crowd began to disperse.</t2195>
<t2196>Only then did I enter the calculus class, sitting down right after Mr. Jiminez began another interminable lecture.</t2196>
<t2197>I brought Margo's "The Grass Wings" to school, hid the book in my desk, and started rereading the marked lines in the poem "Soliloquy" while Mr. Jiminez scratched words on the board.</t2197> <t2198>There was no mention of New York. A few minutes later, I handed the book to Radar, who looked at it for a moment and then wrote on the corner of his notebook, closest to me, The green highlights must mean something.</t2198> <t2199>Maybe Margo wants you to open your mind?</t2199> <t2200>I shrugged, wrote back, Or maybe Margo just read the poem on two different days, with two different highlighters.</t2200>
<t2201>A few minutes later, when I glanced at the clock for the thirty-seventh time, I saw Ben Starling standing outside the classroom door, a hall pass[7] in his hand, bouncing like crazy to a jig.</t2201>
<t2202>When the lunch bell rang, I rushed straight to my locker, but somehow Ben had beaten me there, and somehow he was talking to Lacey Pemberton. Ben stood close to Lacey, slightly tilting his head to look directly at her.</t2202> <t2203>Talking to Ben sometimes made me feel claustrophobic, and it's not like I was some hot girl or anything.</t2203>
<t2204>"Hello, friends," I said upon arriving.</t2204>
<t2205>“Hi,” Lacey said, taking a clear step back to avoid Ben. “Ben just told me some things about Margo.</t2205> <t2206>You know, no one has ever been in her room.</t2206> <t2207>Margo said that her parents don't allow her to invite friends over.”</t2207>
<t2208>“Really?” Lacey nodded. “So, do you know that Margo has about, let's see, one thousand records?”</t2208>
<t2209>Lacey raised both hands. "Not at all, Ben just asked the same thing!</t2209> <t2210>Margo never talks about music.</t2210> <t2211>Actually, she does mention liking this or that on the radio or somewhere.</t2211> <t2212>But–no mention of records at all.</t2212> <t2213>She's really strange."</t2213>
<t2214>I shrugged.</t2214> <t2215>Maybe Margo is strange, or maybe the rest of us are the strange ones.</t2215> <t2216>Lacey continued.</t2216> <t2217>“But we were just talking about how Walt Whitman was from New York.”</t2217>
<t2218>"And according to the Complete Chronicles, Woody Guthrie also lived there for a long time," Ben added.</t2218>
<t2219>I nodded. "I think it's very likely that Margo is in New York.</t2219> <t2220>But we probably have to find the next clue.</t2220> <t2221>We can't just stop at the book.</t2221> <t2222>There must be something undeciphered from the marked lines of poetry."</t2222>
<t2223>"Sure, can I take a look at the book during lunch?"</t2223>
<t2224>"Sure," I said.</t2224> <t2225>"Or if you want, I can make a copy for you in the library."</t2225>
<t2226>“No need, I'm just reading.</t2226> <t2227>Actually, I don't understand much about poetry at all.</t2227> <t2228>Oh, but anyway, I have a cousin who's studying there, at New York University, I can send her the flyer to print out.</t2228> <t2229>I'll ask her to leave the flyers at the music stores.</t2229> <t2230>Of course, there are many music stores, but it's worth a try.”</t2230>
<t2231>"That's a good idea," I said.</t2231> <t2232>Ben and Lacey started heading to the cafeteria, and I followed them.</t2232>
<t2233>“Hey,” Ben asked Lacey, “what color is your dress?”</t2233>
<t2234>"Uh, like sapphire blue, how about that?"</t2234>
<t2235>“Then I'll match my formal suit to it,” Ben replied.</t2235> <t2236>I had never seen Ben smile so goofily, and that says something, because he was already quite goofy.</t2236>
<t2237>Lacey nodded.</t2237> <t2238>“Alright, but we shouldn't be too much of a perfect match.</t2238> <t2239>Maybe you should just stick to tradition: a black suit?”</t2239>
<t2240>“Not wearing a wide belt, do you think that's appropriate?”</t2240>
<t2241>"Alright, that's fine.</t2241> <t2242>But don't wear too many frilly, ruffled clothes."</t2242>
<t2243>The two kept talking endlessly–clearly, the ideal ratio of water spinach to water was a topic that could be discussed for hours–but I stopped paying attention while queuing up at Pizza Hut. Ben had found a date for the prom, and Lacey had found a guy who was excited to talk about the prom for hours.</t2243> <t2244>Now everyone had a partner–except for me, and I wasn't going to the prom.</t2244> <t2245>The only girl I wanted to accompany was embarking on an endless journey or something like that.</t2245>
<t2246>When we sat down to eat, Lacey began reading "Song of Myself," and agreed that the verses didn't convey anything, nor did they resemble Margo at all.</t2246> <t2247>We still hadn't figured out what Margo meant, if she was indeed implying something.</t2247> <t2248>Lacey handed the book back to me, then she and he continued to chatter about the prom.</t2248>
<t2249>All afternoon, I had the feeling that just looking at those marked lines of poetry wouldn't help at all.</t2249> <t2250>But then I got bored, rummaged through my backpack, took out the poetry book, placed it on my lap, and read it again.</t2250> <t2251>My last subject was National Language, seventh period, and the whole class had just started on Moby Dick, so Ms. Holden was lecturing quite a bit about nineteenth-century whaling.</t2251> <t2252>I placed Moby Dick on the desk and Whitman on my lap, but even sitting in National Language class didn't add any effect.</t2252> <t2253>There were moments when I didn't look at the clock for several minutes, so I was a bit surprised when the bell rang, thus taking more time to pack up my books than the others.</t2253> <t2254>As I slung my backpack over my shoulder and started to leave the class, Ms. Holden smiled at me and said, "Walt Whitman, huh?"</t2254>
<t2255>I nodded in embarrassment.</t2255>
<t2256>“Not bad,” she said.</t2256> <t2257>“Good enough that I almost agreed to let you read during class.</t2257> <t2258>But not for too long.”</t2258> <t2259>I mumbled an apology and walked to the senior student parking lot.</t2259>
<t2260>While Ben and Radar were practicing music, I sat in RHAPAW with the car door open, a gentle breeze slowly caressing through.</t2260> <t2261>I was reading The Federalist Papers to prepare for tomorrow's government class test, but my mind kept wandering between Guthrie, Whitman, New York, and Margo.</t2261> <t2262>Did Margo go to New York to pursue country music?</t2262> <t2263>Is there a secret Margo passionate about country music that I never knew about?</t2263> <t2264>Is she living in an apartment that one of them once lived in?</t2264> <t2265>And why did she want to tell me all of that?</t2265>
<t2266>Looking through the side mirror, I saw Ben and Radar approaching.</t2266> <t2267>Radar was swinging the saxophone case as he walked briskly to RHAPAW. The two of them rushed in through the open door, Ben inserted the key into the ignition, and RHAPAW started to sputter.</t2267> <t2268>We hoped, it sputtered again, we hoped a little more, and finally, it coughed to life.</t2268> <t2269>Ben managed to speed through the parking lot, turning out of the school before shouting at me, “CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?” He could hardly contain his excitement.</t2269>
<t2270>Ben started honking the horn, but of course, the horn didn't work, so every time he honked, Ben would shout, "BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! HONK IF YOU'RE GOING TO PROM WITH SUPER BUNNY LACEY PEMBERTON! HONK, HONK!"</t2270>
<t2271>Ben hardly turned off the speaker the entire way home.</t2271> <t2272>“Do you guys know what has really happened?</t2272> <t2273>Besides the feeling of despair?</t2273> <t2274>I guess Lacey and Becca Arrington are fighting because, as you all know, Becca is quite the cunning trickster.</t2274> <t2275>I also think Lacey is starting to feel remorseful about the whole Ben Bullshit thing. He didn’t say it outright, but he behaved somewhat like that.</t2275> <t2276>So in the end, Ben Bullshit will get me some attention.”</t2276> <t2277>I was very happy for Ben and all, but I wanted to focus on the game leading to Margo.</t2277>
<t2278>"Do you have any more ideas?"</t2278>
<t2279>The whole group fell silent for a moment, then Radar looked at me through the rearview mirror and said, "The line about the door is the only one that stands out from the rest, and it's also the most random. I really think that line holds a clue."</t2279> <t2280>"What is the whole line again?"</t2280>
<t2281>“Remove the lock from the door! / Remove the door itself from the frame!” I repeated.</t2281>
<t2282>“I must admit, Jefferson Park isn't really the ideal place to unlock the doors of narrow-mindedness from their frames,” Radar confirmed.</t2282> <t2283>“Maybe that's what Margo meant.</t2283> <t2284>As she said, Orlando is a paper town, right? Maybe Margo is explaining why she left.”</t2284>
<t2285>Ben slowed down to stop at the traffic light, then turned to look at Radar.</t2285> <t2286>"Hey buddy," Ben said, "I think you guys are overcomplicating the Margo rabbit."</t2286>
<t2287>"What do you mean?" I asked.</t2287>
<t2288>"Remove the lock from the door!" Ben said.</t2288> <t2289>"Remove the door itself from the frame</t2289><t2290>!"</t2290>
<t2291>"Oh right," I exclaimed.</t2291> <t2292>The light turned green and Ben stepped on the gas. RHAPAW shook violently as if it was about to fall apart, but then it continued to roll on.</t2292>
<t2293>"That is not poetry. Nor is it a metaphor.</t2293> <t2294>Those are instructions.</t2294> <t2295>We will have to enter Margo's room, remove the lock from the door, and take the door itself off its frame."</t2295>
<t2296>Radar looked at me through the rearview mirror, and I looked back at him.</t2296> <t2297>“Sometimes,” Radar said to me, “my friend is so slow that it becomes superhuman.</t2297><t2298>”</t2298>
<t2299>6.</t2299>
<t2300>After parking in my driveway, we walked across the strip of grass separating Margo's house from mine, just like we did on Saturday. Ruthie opened the door and said her parents wouldn't be home until six; Myrna Mountweazel was bustling around us; we all went upstairs.</t2300> <t2301>Ruthie brought us a toolbox from the garage, and then we all stood there staring at Margo's bedroom door for a moment.</t2301> <t2302>None of us were handy enough to handle this task.</t2302>
<t2303>“What the hell are we going to do now?” Ben asked.</t2303>
<t2304>"Don't curse in front of Ruthie," I reminded him.</t2304>
<t2305>"Ruthie, do you mind when I talk about demons?"</t2305>
<t2306>“Ghosts aren't real,” Ruthie said in response.</t2306>
<t2307>Radar interrupted.</t2307> <t2308>"Now," he said firmly, "let's focus.</t2308> <t2309>The door."</t2309> <t2310>Radar pulled out a flathead screwdriver from the pile of tools and bent down to remove the door handle.</t2310> <t2311>I grabbed a larger screwdriver and tried to remove the hinges, but there didn't seem to be any screws.</t2311> <t2312>I examined the door a bit more.</t2312> <t2313>Eventually, Ruthie got bored and went downstairs to watch TV.</t2313>
<t2314>Radar managed to loosen the door handle, and we took turns peeking inside the rough, unpainted wood around the handle.</t2314> <t2315>There was no message.</t2315> <t2316>Not a single note.</t2316> <t2317>Nothing at all.</t2317> <t2318>Annoyed, I turned back to the hinge, fumbling with how to remove it.</t2318> <t2319>I opened and closed the door, trying to understand the principle of the hinge bar.</t2319> <t2320>“That poem is disgustingly long,” I said.</t2320> <t2321>“Do you think old poet Walt wrote a line or two somewhere on how to remove the door from the frame?”</t2321>
<t2322>Only when Radar spoke did I realize he was sitting in front of Margo's computer.</t2322> <t2323>"According to the Complete Encyclopedia of Everything," he said, "we need to find the leaf hinge first.</t2323> <t2324>Just use a screwdriver to pry the pin up.</t2324> <t2325>By the way, some idiot also added that the leaf hinge works smoothly when the lane is broken.</t2325> <t2326>Oh, Complete Encyclopedia of Everything. Are you kidding me?”</t2326>
<t2327>Once again, the Complete Book of Everything has shown us what to do, and the practice was unexpectedly easy.</t2327> <t2328>I removed the pins from the three hinges, and Ben lifted the door out.</t2328> <t2329>I carefully examined the hinges and the rough wood on the door frame.</t2329> <t2330>Nothing.</t2330>
<t2331>"The door has nothing," Ben said.</t2331> <t2332>Ben and I reassembled the door as it was, and Radar hammered the nails back in with the handle of a screwdriver.</t2332>
<t2333>Radar and I went to Ben's house, which had the exact same architecture as mine, and played a game called Angry Arctic. This is a kind of game-within-a-game, where players shoot each other with paint bombs on ice.</t2333> <t2334>If you hit the opponent's crotch, you get bonus points.</t2334> <t2335>In short, it's a pretty sophisticated and complex game.</t2335> <t2336>"Guys, Margo must be in New York," Ben said.</t2336> <t2337>I saw the barrel of his gun peeking from a corner, but before I could move, he shot me right between the legs.</t2337> <t2338>"Damn it," I muttered.</t2338>
<t2339>Radar said, "Looking back, it seems like Margo's clues lead to one place.</t2339> <t2340>She told Jase; and left us hints tied to two people who have spent almost their entire lives in New York. Very logical.</t2340><t2341>"</t2341>
<t2342>Ben said, "That's what Margo wants, guys." As I was inching closer to Ben, he paused the game again.</t2342> <t2343>"She wants you to go to New York. What if Margo arranged it so that was the only way to find her?"</t2343> <t2344>"Actually go to that place?"</t2344>
<t2345>“What? That is a city with twelve million people.”</t2345>
<t2346>“Who knows, maybe Margo has a mole spy here,” Radar said.</t2346> <t2347>“That person will inform Margo if you hit the road.</t2347><t2348>”</t2348>
<t2349>“It's Lacey!” Ben exclaimed. “It must be Lacey.</t2349> <t2350>That's right!</t2350> <t2351>You will get on a plane to New York right now.</t2351> <t2352>And when Lacey finds out, Margo will pick you up at the airport.</t2352> <t2353>Exactly.</t2353> <t2354>Now, I'll take you home, you'll pack your bags, then I'll drive your butt to the airport, and you'll buy a plane ticket with your emergency-only credit card.</t2354> <t2355>And when Margo realizes how tough you are, the kind of toughness that Jase Worthington couldn't even dream of, the three of us will take the hot girls to the prom together.”</t2355>
<t2356>I have no doubt that it won't be long before there is a flight to New York. From Orlando, planes to anywhere will soon take off.</t2356> <t2357>But I doubt all the other factors.</t2357> <t2358>"If you inform Lacey...," I said.</t2358>
<t2359>"Lacey won't confess!" Ben said.</t2359> <t2360>"Just think about all their distractions—maybe the two of them are just pretending to fight so you won't suspect that Lacey is the mole.</t2360><t2361>"</t2361>
<t2362>Radar said, "I don't know, it doesn't really clarify anything."</t2362> <t2363>He continued talking, but I only half-listened.</t2363> <t2364>Staring at the motionless screen in front of me, I kept thinking about the situation.</t2364> <t2365>If Margo and Lacey were just pretending to be mad at each other, would Lacey pretend to break up with her boyfriend?</t2365> <t2366>Pretend to be worried?</t2366> <t2367>Lacey had personally handled dozens of emails—none of which had any real information—from the flyers her cousin had left in record stores in New York. Lacey was not a spy mole, and Ben's plan was too ridiculous.</t2367> <t2368>But, the very idea of a plan intrigued me.</t2368> <t2369>However, with only two and a half weeks left until the end of the school year, if I went to New York, I would have to miss at least two days—not to mention my parents would kill me for buying a plane ticket with a credit card.</t2369> <t2370>The more I thought about it, the more absurd this plan seemed.</t2370> <t2371>But, if only I could see her tomorrow...</t2371> <t2372>But no.</t2372> <t2373>"I can't skip school," I finally concluded, then continued the game.</t2373> <t2374>"I have a French test tomorrow."</t2374>
<t2375>"You know," Ben said.</t2375> <t2376>"Your romanticism is a true source of inspiration.</t2376><t2377>"</t2377>
<t2378>I played for a few more minutes and then walked home through Jefferson Park.</t2378>
<t2379>There was a time when my mother told me about a mentally ill child she had taken care of.</t2379> <t2380>The boy was completely normal until he was nine years old, when his father passed away.</t2380> <t2381>Although clearly many nine-year-old children lose their fathers, and in most cases, none of them go insane, perhaps this boy was an exception.</t2381>
<t2382>And the boy did this, he took a pencil and one of those things like a metal compass, and started drawing circles on paper.</t2382> <t2383>All the circles had an exact radius of five centimeters.</t2383> <t2384>The boy kept drawing circles until the paper was completely black, then he would take another sheet and continue drawing circles.</t2384> <t2385>He did this every day, all day long, not paying attention to his studies, drawing circles all over his tests and schoolwork.</t2385> <t2386>My mother said the boy's problem was that he had created a regular habit to cope with loss, but it was this very habit that was destroying him.</t2386> <t2387>So when my mother tried to make the boy cry for his lost father, he stopped drawing circles, and was said to live happily ever after from then on.</t2387> <t2388>But sometimes I think about that boy drawing circles, because it seems like I understand him.</t2388> <t2389>I've always liked regular habits.</t2389> <t2390>I even think that I never found boredom to be all that boring.</t2390> <t2391>Maybe I can't explain this to someone like Margo, but drawing circles for the rest of my life gives me a bit of a crazy sense of meaning.</t2391>
<t2392>So I need to feel okay about the decision not to go to New York—even though it was a terrible idea anyway.</t2392> <t2393>But as the steady rhythm of that night and the next day at school went by, it gradually gnawed at me, as if those very common sense reasons were pulling me away from the moment I would see her again.</t2393>
<t2394>7.</t2394>
<t2395>On Tuesday night, Margo had been gone for six days, and I talked to my parents.</t2395> <t2396>It wasn't a major decision or anything like that; I just told them.</t2396> <t2397>I sat by the kitchen counter while Dad chopped vegetables and Mom put beef in the skillet.</t2397> <t2398>Dad teased me, asking how much time I had buried into that short book, and I replied, "Actually, it's not for Literature class, but it seems like Margo intentionally left the book for me to figure out."</t2398> <t2399>My parents went silent, so I recounted everything related to Woody Guthrie and Whitman.</t2399>
<t2400>"The girl clearly likes to play the game of scattering these bits of information," Dad said.</t2400>
<t2401>“I don't blame Margo for wanting attention,” Mom said, then turned to me and continued, “but that doesn't mean you have to be responsible for Margo's situation.</t2401><t2402>”</t2402>
<t2403>Dad dropped the carrots and onions into the pan.</t2403> <t2404>"Hmm, that's right.</t2404> <t2405>It's not that we can't anticipate or diagnose about Margo just because we haven't met in person, but I think your friend will come home soon.</t2405><t2406>"</t2406>
<t2407>"We shouldn't predict the dosage," Mom whispered to Dad, as if I couldn't hear or something like that.</t2407> <t2408>Dad was about to say something, but I interrupted.</t2408>
<t2409>"What should I do?"</t2409>
<t2410>"Graduation, dear," mother replied.</t2410> <t2411>"And trust that Margo can handle it herself, she has always been resourceful."</t2411><t2412>"</t2412>
<t2413>"Dad agrees with mom," dad affirmed.</t2413> <t2414>But after dinner, when I went to my room and played Resurrection on mute, I overheard my parents quietly talking to each other.</t2414> <t2415>I couldn't make out the specific words, but I sensed a tone of worry in their voices.</t2415>
<t2416>Late that night, Ben called my cell phone.</t2416>
<t2417>"Hello," I said.</t2417>
<t2418>"Hey buddy," Ben called.</t2418>
<t2419>“Okay, listen,” I replied.</t2419>
<t2420>“I'm about to go shoe shopping with Lacey.”</t2420>
<t2421>“Going to buy shoes?”</t2421>
<t2422>“Yeah.</t2422> <t2423>Everything is thirty percent off from ten PM to midnight.</t2423> <t2424>Lacey wants me to help her pick out shoes for the prom.</t2424> <t2425>Of course, Lacey already has shoes, but I went to her house yesterday and we both agreed that those pairs... you know, people want to wear the perfect shoes to the prom.</t2425> <t2426>So Lacey will return the pair she bought, and then we’ll go to Burdines and we’ll–”</t2426>
<t2427>"Ben," I interrupted him.</t2427>
<t2428>"What?"</t2428>
<t2429>“I don't want to keep chewing over Lacey's party shoes, buddy.</t2429> <t2430>And I'll tell you right away why: I have something that makes me really uninterested in dancing shoes.</t2430> <t2431>It's a torym.</t2431><t2432>”</t2432>
<t2433>"Actually, I was nervous and couldn't help but think that I really liked Lacey, not just in the she's-a-hot-girl-to-take-to-the-prom way, but more like she's-so-cool-and-I-really-want-to-be-around-her way."</t2433> <t2434>"And it seems, maybe Lacey and I will go to the prom together, and the two of us, well, will kiss on the dance floor, and all of them, oh my god, you know, all the ridiculous things they think about me will be thrown out the window—"</t2434>
<t2435>"Ben," I said.</t2435> <t2436>"Stop this nonsense rambling, and you'll be fine." It went on incessantly for a while longer, but eventually, I managed to put the phone down.</t2436>
<t2437>I lay down and began to feel a bit disheartened about the prom.</t2437> <t2438>I had not indulged in any sort of sorrowful lamentation over the fact that I wouldn't be attending the prom, but–foolishly and embarrassingly–I had fantasized about finding Margo, bringing her home with me, just in time to go to the prom, like late Saturday night or something.</t2438> <t2439>Then the two of us would walk into the Hilton ballroom, wearing jeans and tattered T-shirts.</t2439> <t2440>And we would just make it for the last dance, the two of us dancing together while everyone pointed and marveled because Margo had returned.</t2440> <t2441>Finally, she and I would gracefully fox-trot out of there, then go get ice cream at Friendly’s.</t2441> <t2442>So yes, just like Ben, I had secretly harbored wonderful fantasies about that ridiculous prom.</t2442> <t2443>But at least I didn't make a big fuss about it.</t2443>
<t2444>There are times when Ben is truly an idiot who only thinks of himself, and I have to remind myself why I still like him.</t2444> <t2445>If there are no obstacles, occasionally he comes up with some pretty bold ideas.</t2445> <t2446>For instance, his reasoning about the window frame.</t2446> <t2447>Even though it wasn't directly effective, it was still an excellent idea.</t2447> <t2448>But clearly, Margo intended to say something different to me.</t2448>
<t2449>For me.</t2449>
<t2450>The clue is mine.</t2450> <t2451>The doors are mine!</t2451>
<t2452>To get to the garage, I had to go through the living room, where my parents were sitting and watching TV.</t2452> <t2453>"Want to watch?" my mom asked me. "This case is about to be solved." It was one of those crime shows, the kind where they find the culprit.</t2453>
<t2454>"No," I replied, running from the living room through the kitchen, into the garage.</t2454> <t2455>I found the largest flathead screwdriver, tucked it into the waistband of my khaki shorts, and tightened my belt.</t2455> <t2456>I grabbed a cookie from the kitchen and then went back through the living room to my room, walking a bit awkwardly.</t2456> <t2457>While my parents were engrossed in the TV show revealing the mystery of the case, I quietly removed the three screws from the hinge of my room door.</t2457> <t2458>When the last one came out, the door made a "crack" sound and loosened.</t2458> <t2459>I pushed and pulled the door around the edge of the wall with one hand, and as I did so, I saw a tiny piece of paper—about the size of my thumbnail—fall from the top hinge.</t2459> <t2460>Classic Margo. Why hide something in her own room when she could hide it in mine?</t2460> <t2461>I wondered when she had done it, and how she had gotten in.</t2461> <t2462>I couldn't help but smile.</t2462>
<t2463>It was a piece torn from the Orlando Sentinel, half neatly cut, half jagged.</t2463> <t2464>I knew it was the Sentinel because at the torn corner were the words “ntinel Orlando May 6, 2.” The day Margo disappeared.</t2464> <t2465>Clearly, this was a message from her.</t2465> <t2466>I recognized Margo's handwriting: 8328 Bartlesville Avenue.</t2466>
<t2467>I can't install the door without hammering the nails back into place with a screwdriver, which would surely alert my parents.</t2467> <t2468>So I just hooked the door onto the hinges and left it ajar.</t2468> <t2469>I dropped the nails into my pocket, went to the computer to look up 8328 Bartlesville Avenue on the map.</t2469> <t2470>I had never heard of this place before.</t2470>
<t2471>That place is thirty-four point six miles away, at the end of Colonial Drive and near the city of Christmas, Florida. When I zoomed in on the satellite image of the building, it looked like a black rectangle, with a dull silvery front and grass behind it.</t2471> <t2472>A mobile home, perhaps?</t2472> <t2473>It's hard to gauge the scale because of the surrounding shrubs.</t2473>
<t2474>I called Ben and recounted.</t2474> <t2475>"So I was right, huh!" he said triumphantly.</t2475> <t2476>"I must tell Lacey immediately, because she also absolutely believes that it's a sound deduction.</t2476><t2477>"</t2477>
<t2478>I ignored the comment about Lacey.</t2478> <t2479>"I guess I'll go check it out," I said.</t2479>
<t2480>“Oh wow, yes, of course, I'll go.</t2480> <t2481>I'll go too. Let's start on Sunday morning.</t2481> <t2482>We'll probably be exhausted after the big party the night before, but who cares.</t2482><t2483>”</t2483>
<t2484>“No, I mean I will leave tonight,” I said.</t2484>
<t2485>"It's already dark, my friend.</t2485> <t2486>You can't go to a strange building with a mysterious address in the dead of night.</t2486> <t2487>Haven't you ever watched a horror movie before?"</t2487>
<t2488>“It's possible that Margo is there,” I said.</t2488>
<t2489>“Yeah, there’s also a possibility that some monster that only likes to feast on the pancreas of young guys is there too,” Ben rambled.</t2489> <t2490>“Dear God, at least wait until tomorrow, even though after band practice I have to pin a boutonniere on Lacey, and then I want to stay home in case she texts, because lately we’ve been texting a ton—”</t2490>
<t2491>I interrupted Ben. "No, tonight."</t2491> <t2492>"I want to see Margo." I felt the circle tightening.</t2492> <t2493>In another hour, if I hurry, I might get to see her.</t2493>
<t2494>"Come on, buddy, I'm not going to let you wander around to some vague address in the middle of the night."</t2494> <t2495>"If you keep messing around, I'll zap you with a stun gun right on your butt."</t2495>
<t2496>“Alright, tomorrow morning then,” I said, almost to myself.</t2496> <t2497>“We'll go tomorrow morning.” Anyway, I was already tired of my perfect attendance record.</t2497> <t2498>Ben didn't say anything.</t2498> <t2499>I heard him whistling through his front teeth.</t2499>
<t2500>“I really feel like some kind of illness is coming on,” it said. “Fever.</t2500> <t2501>Cough. Pain. Fatigue.” I smiled.</t2501> <t2502>After hanging up, I called Radar.</t2502>
<t2503>“I’m on another line with Ben,” Radar said.</t2503> <t2504>“Let me call you back.”</t2504>
<t2505>A minute later, Radar called back.</t2505> <t2506>I hadn't even had a chance to say hello when he started, "Q, I have a severe migraine.</t2506> <t2507>There's no way I can go to school tomorrow." I burst out laughing.</t2507>
<t2508>Hanging up the phone, I took off some clothes, leaving only a t-shirt and shorts.</t2508> <t2509>I emptied the trash bin into the desk drawer and placed the trash bin next to the bed.</t2509> <t2510>I set the alarm clock to an ungodly hour, six in the morning.</t2510> <t2511>The next few hours I spent in vain, unable to sleep.</t2511>
<t2512>8.</t2512>
<t2513>The next morning, my mother came into my room and said, "Yesterday, you didn't even bother to close your door, did you, sleepyhead?" I opened my eyes and replied, "My stomach hurts too much, Mom," and shifted towards the trash can now holding my vomit.</t2513> <t2514>"Quentin! Oh my God! Since when have you been feeling unwell?"</t2514>
<t2515>“Since around six o'clock,” I replied, and it was indeed true.</t2515>
<t2516>“Why not call your parents?”</t2516>
<t2517>"I'm so tired," I replied, and it was true.</t2517>
<t2518>"Is it too uncomfortable for you to sleep?" mother asked anxiously.</t2518>
<t2519>“Yes,” this is not correct.</t2519> <t2520>I woke up because the alarm clock rang at six o'clock, then I tiptoed into the kitchen, ate a cereal bar, and drank some orange juice.</t2520> <t2521>Ten minutes later, I stuck two fingers down my throat.</t2521> <t2522>I didn't want to do that at night because I was afraid the vomit would smell up the room all night.</t2522> <t2523>The vomiting was quite horrifying but it passed quickly.</t2523>
<t2524>Mom took the trash can away, I heard her scrubbing it in the kitchen.</t2524> <t2525>Mom returned with the clean can, her lips pressed together in worry.</t2525> <t2526>"Maybe I should take a day off–" she hadn't finished speaking when I immediately interrupted.</t2526>
<t2527>"I'm really fine, Dad.</t2527> <t2528>Just feeling a bit nauseous.</t2528> <t2529>Probably ate something bad."</t2529>
<t2530>"Are you sure you're okay?"</t2530>
<t2531>"If I feel worse, I'll call," I said.</t2531> <t2532>Mom kissed my forehead, her lipstick sticky on my skin.</t2532> <t2533>Actually, I wasn't sick at all, but regardless, Mom made me feel better.</t2533>
<t2534>"Do you want me to close the door?" Mom asked, one hand on the door.</t2534> <t2535>The door was still just loosely hanging on its hinges.</t2535>
<t2536>"Don't, don't, mom, please don't close it," I stammered, probably because I was too nervous.</t2536>
<t2537>“Alright,” mom said.</t2537> <t2538>“On my way to work, I'll call the school for you.</t2538> <t2539>If you need anything, let me know immediately, okay?</t2539> <t2540>Anything at all.</t2540> <t2541>Or if you want me to come home, just say so.</t2541> <t2542>And you can call dad anytime as well.</t2542> <t2543>I'll call in the afternoon to check how things are going, alright?”</t2543>
<t2544>I nodded and then pulled the blanket up to my chin.</t2544> <t2545>Even though the trash can was clean, I could still smell a faint odor of vomit mixed with the scent of soap, which reminded me of the earlier vomiting episode, and for some reason, made me want to vomit again.</t2545> <t2546>But I just breathed slowly, even opening my mouth to breathe until I heard the sound of the Chrysler backing away from the house.</t2546> <t2547>The clock showed 7:32.</t2547> <t2548>At least for now, I thought I would be on time.</t2548>
<t2549>Not exactly on time for class, have to admit that.</t2549> <t2550>But still on time.</t2550>
<t2551>I showered, brushed my teeth, slipped into a pair of dark jeans and a plain black t-shirt, and tucked Margo's newspaper clipping into my pocket.</t2551> <t2552>I nailed the hinge back in place, then got ready to hit the road.</t2552> <t2553>I wasn't sure what to pack in my backpack, but I had a screwdriver to remove the door frame's vertical bar, a printed satellite map, directions, a water bottle, and a book of Whitman's poetry, just in case Margo was there.</t2553> <t2554>I wanted to ask her about that poetry book.</t2554>
<t2555>Ben and Radar arrived at exactly eight o'clock, not a second early or late.</t2555> <t2556>I sat in the back seat.</t2556> <t2557>The two of them were loudly singing along to a song by the band Mountain Goats.</t2557>
<t2558>Ben turned around and extended his fist towards me.</t2558> <t2559>I lightly bumped it back, even though I didn't like that way of greeting. "Q!" he shouted, drowning out the music.</t2559> <t2560>"How awesome is this game?"</t2560>
<t2561>I understand exactly what Ben means: listening to Mountain Goats music with comrades in a car cruising on a Wednesday morning in May, on the road leading to Margo, and any award as awesome-as-Margo if we find her.</t2561> <t2562>"Way cooler than calculus," I respond.</t2562> <t2563>The music is loud and lively, making it hard to talk to each other.</t2563> <t2564>Leaving the Jefferson Park area, we roll down a functioning window so that people know we have great taste in music.</t2564>
<t2565>We ran along Colonial Drive, past the movie theaters and bookstores that I had frequented my entire life.</t2565>
<t2566>But this trip was different and much more enjoyable, because the journey took place during calculus class, because I was accompanied by Ben and Radar, because we were on our way to where I believed I would find Margo.</t2566> <t2567>And finally, after twenty miles, the city of Orlando gave way to the last orange groves and the still-untouched farms—the flat land stretching endlessly, thickening under the brush, Spanish moss clinging to the oak branches, freely hanging down in the windless heat.</t2567> <t2568>This is the Florida where I spent nights chasing armadillos, getting bitten all over by mosquitoes, back when I was a Boy Scout.</t2568> <t2569>On the road now were only pickup trucks, and every mile or so, there was a small subdivision off the highway—winding little streets for no reason, circling around houses that sprang up in the middle of nowhere, like a plastic-coated volcano.</t2569>
<t2570>Continuing on, we drove past an old wooden sign that read GROVEPOINT ACRES.</t2570> <t2571>A cracked black road stretched only a few hundred meters before ending in a gray patch of land, hinting that Grovepoint Acres was what my mother used to call a “ghost town”–a subdivision abandoned before construction was completed.</t2571> <t2572>On previous trips, my parents had pointed out ghost towns like this to me, but I had never seen one as desolate and barren as this.</t2572>
<t2573>We drove about five miles past Grovepoint Acres when Radar turned down the music and announced, "About one more mile to go."</t2573><t2574>"</t2574>
<t2575>I took a deep breath.</t2575> <t2576>The excitement of skipping school to go out had gradually faded.</t2576> <t2577>This place didn't seem like somewhere Margo would hide, or even visit.</t2577> <t2578>A world apart from New York City. This is the part of Florida that people just fly over, wondering how anyone could live on this peninsula.</t2578> <t2579>I stared at the empty asphalt road, the heat blurring my vision.</t2579> <t2580>Ahead, a strip of stores looked like a wavering shopping area in the distant sunlight.</t2580>
<t2581>"Over there, right?" I asked, leaning forward to point.</t2581>
<t2582>“Of course,” Radar replied.</t2582>
<t2583>Ben pressed the sound system control button, and we were enveloped in silence as Ben pulled the car into a parking lot long claimed by a layer of gray sand.</t2583> <t2584>There used to be signs for four stores on this frontage.</t2584> <t2585>A rusty pole, about two and a half meters high, was planted by the roadside.</t2585> <t2586>But the signs had long since vanished, either blown away by some storm or due to accumulated decay.</t2586> <t2587>The row of stores fared slightly better: a single-story building with a flat roof, sparsely dotted with exposed concrete blocks.</t2587> <t2588>Strips of peeling paint clung to the walls, like insects desperately holding onto their nests.</t2588> <t2589>Water stains painted abstract brown patterns on the window panes.</t2589> <t2590>The windows were patched together with plywood sheets.</t2590> <t2591>A terrible thought burst into my mind, a thought that couldn't be contained once it had seeped into the atmosphere of awareness: it seemed this was not a place where people came to live.</t2591> <t2592>This was a place where people came to die.</t2592>
<t2593>As soon as the car stopped, my nose and mouth were filled with the pungent smell of death.</t2593> <t2594>I had to swallow back the rising nausea that was burning and painful at the back of my throat.</t2594> <t2595>Only now, after all the lost time, did I realize how terribly wrong I had been about Margo's game and the reward for the winner.</t2595>
<t2596>I got out of the car, Ben stood next to me, and Radar next to him.</t2596> <t2597>I immediately understood that this was not fun at all, that it was not about proving-you-have-the-guts-to-hang-out-with-me.</t2597> <t2598>I heard Margo's voice that night when we drove around Orlando.</t2598> <t2599>I heard her say to me, "I don't want some kid to find me all covered in flies and ants on a Saturday morning in Jefferson Park."</t2599> <t2600>Not wanting to be found by kids in Jefferson Park does not mean not wanting to die.</t2600>
<t2601>There was nothing to indicate that anyone had been here for a long time, except for the smell, that sour, pungent, sickly smell that kept the living away from the dead.</t2601> <t2602>I told myself that Margo couldn't possibly smell like that, but of course she could.</t2602> <t2603>All of us could smell like that.</t2603> <t2604>I raised my arm to my nose to smell my sweat and skin, anything but the smell of death.</t2604>
<t2605>“MARGO?” Radar called.</t2605> <t2606>A mockingbird perched on the rusty gutter of the building, chirping back two syllables. “MARGO!” Radar called out again.</t2606> <t2607>Nothing.</t2607> <t2608>Radar kicked at the sand in frustration, cursing, “Damn it.</t2608><t2609>”</t2609>
<t2610>Standing in front of this building, I understand something about fear.</t2610> <t2611>I understand that it is not the dull hallucination of someone who perhaps wants something significant to happen to them, even if that significant thing is truly terrifying.</t2611> <t2612>It is not the feeling of horror when seeing a stranger die, nor the breathless moment when hearing the sound of gunfire from Becca Arrington's house.</t2612> <t2613>It cannot be calmed by breathing exercises. This fear bears no resemblance to the fears I have known before.</t2613> <t2614>It lies in the deepest place of all possible emotions, a feeling that follows us from before we existed, before this building existed, even before the earth existed.</t2614> <t2615>It is the fear that pushed fish from dry land to evolve lungs, the fear that taught us to run, the fear that makes us bury the deceased.</t2615>
<t2616>That smell gripped me in a panic of despair—not panic as if my lungs had run out of air, but as if the entire biosphere had run out of air. I think the reason I worry most of the time is that I try to prepare myself, training my body to be ready to fight against the true fear when it comes.</t2616> <t2617>But I am not ready.</t2617>
<t2618>“We should go, guys,” Ben spoke up.</t2618> <t2619>“We should call the police or something like that.” We still hadn't looked at each other.</t2619> <t2620>The three of us kept staring at the building, the place that had been abandoned for so long it couldn't hide anything except corpses.</t2620>
<t2621>"No," Radar shouted. "No no no no no.</t2621> <t2622>We'll call when we have something to report.</t2622> <t2623>Margo left this address for Q.</t2623> <t2624>Not for the police.</t2624> <t2625>We have to find a way to get in there."</t2625>
<t2626>"In there?" Ben asked suspiciously.</t2626>
<t2627>I patted Ben on the back, and for the first time all day, the three of us didn't look forward but turned to look at each other.</t2627> <t2628>That made it bearable.</t2628> <t2629>When I looked at my two friends, something told me that Margo wouldn't be dead until we found her. "Yes, let's go in there," I said.</t2629>
<t2630>I no longer know who Margo is, or who she ever was, but I need to find her.</t2630>
<t2631>9.</t2631>
<t2632>We went to the back of the building and saw four locked iron doors.</t2632> <t2633>There was nothing but wasteland, with a few clumps of palm trees scattered across the vast half-yellow, half-green grass.</t2633> <t2634>The musty smell here was even stronger, making me hesitant to go further.</t2634> <t2635>Ben and Radar were right behind me, to my left and right.</t2635> <t2636>The three of us formed a triangular formation, walking slowly, eyes straining to observe our surroundings.</t2636>
<t2637>“A raccoon!” Ben shouted.</t2637> <t2638>“Oh, thank God, a raccoon, heavens and earth!” Radar and I immediately moved away from the building, towards where Ben was standing by a shallow drainage ditch.</t2638> <t2639>A huge raccoon, with thick matted fur, lay dead and bloated, with no obvious wounds, its fur decomposing, revealing a rib bone.</t2639> <t2640>Radar turned away and gagged, but didn't vomit.</t2640> <t2641>I bent down, wrapping my arms around its shoulders.</t2641> <t2642>When its breathing returned to normal, Radar said, “I’m terribly relieved that it’s the corpse of a terribly disgusting raccoon.</t2642><t2643>”</t2643>
<t2644>Even so, I still can't imagine Margo living here.</t2644> <t2645>I suddenly realized that Whitman's verses might be a suicide note.</t2645> <t2646>I thought of the lines she had marked: "And death is not what people imagine, and it is a blessing.</t2646><t2647>"</t2647>
<t2648>“I return myself to the earth, nurturing the grasses I love, / If you want me, look for me under the soles of your boots.”</t2648> <t2649>In an instant, I saw a glimmer of hope when thinking about the last line of the poem: “Somewhere, I stop and wait for you.”</t2649> <t2650>But then I thought that I don't necessarily have to be a human being.</t2650> <t2651>I could also be a corpse.</t2651>
<t2652>Radar stayed away from the raccoon, tugging at the handle of one of the four locked iron doors.</t2652> <t2653>I felt like praying for the departed—reciting a Kaddish for this raccoon—but I didn't even know how to do it.</t2653> <t2654>I mourned the animal and regretted feeling a silent joy at seeing it like that.</t2654>
<t2655>"We need more force," Radar called. "Help me again."</t2655>
<t2656>Ben and I wrapped our arms around Radar's waist and pulled him back.</t2656> <t2657>He braced his feet against the wall for extra leverage, and then both of us fell heavily onto me.</t2657> <t2658>Radar's sweat-soaked back pressed against my face.</t2658> <t2659>For a moment, I was thrilled, thinking we had made it in.</t2659> <t2660>But then I saw Radar holding the door handle.</t2660> <t2661>I quickly got up to look at the door.</t2661> <t2662>Still firmly closed.</t2662>
<t2663>“This damn forty-year-old door handle!” Radar cursed.</t2663> <t2664>I had never heard it speak like that before.</t2664>
<t2665>"It's okay," I said.</t2665> <t2666>"There's a way.</t2666> <t2667>There has to be a way."</t2667>
<t2668>We circled back to the front of the building.</t2668> <t2669>No doors, no openings, no sign of an underground passage.</t2669> <t2670>But I needed to get inside.</t2670> <t2671>Ben and Radar tried to pry the plywood off the windows, but everything was nailed down tight.</t2671> <t2672>Radar kicked the plywood to no avail.</t2672> <t2673>Ben turned back to me and said, "There's no glass behind the plywood," and he started to back up, his sneakers kicking up sand with each step.</t2673>
<t2674>I didn't understand anything, looking at Ben questioningly.</t2674> <t2675>"I will break through that plywood," he explained.</t2675>
<t2676>“You can't do it.”</t2676> <t2677>Ben was the smallest of the three.</t2677> <t2678>If someone was needed to break through those boarded-up windows, it should be me.</t2678>
<t2679>Ben clenched his hand into a fist and then stretched out his fingers.</t2679> <t2680>As I approached, he began to tell. "When I was in third grade, my mom tried to prevent me from being bullied by enrolling me in a taekwondo class.</t2680> <t2681>I think I only attended three sessions and learned just one move, but it was occasionally quite effective: the kids watched the taekwondo master punch through a thick wooden board, and they all marveled, asking how he did it. The master told the class that if we moved as if our hand would go through the board, and if we believed that our hand would go through, then it surely would."</t2681>
<t2682>I was about to refute that childish logic, when Ben took off, zooming past me like a blur.</t2682> <t2683>The closer he got to the wooden plank, the faster he accelerated, and finally, without any hesitation, he jumped at the last second, twisting his body—shoulder first to absorb the impact—and crashed into the wood.</t2683> <t2684>I half-expected him to break through the plank and leave a Ben-shaped hole, just like in a cartoon.</t2684> <t2685>But he bounced off the wood, landing flat on the bright patch of grass, in a cloud of dust.</t2685> <t2686>Ben rolled over, rubbing his shoulder. "It's broken," he declared.</t2686>
<t2687>I think Ben meant to say his shoulder was broken and rushed over, but then he stood up, and I saw a Ben-height crack on the plywood.</t2687> <t2688>I started kicking at it, the crack split open, then Radar and I managed to wedge our fingers into the crack and began pulling hard.</t2688> <t2689>I squinted to keep the sweat from running into my eyes and stinging them, pulling and pushing to widen the crack.</t2689> <t2690>Radar and I gritted our teeth and kept at it until Radar had to take a break to catch his breath and Ben took over.</t2690> <t2691>Finally, the three of us managed to make a sizable hole in the plywood to get inside this mini shopping area.</t2691> <t2692>I climbed in, blindly stepping onto something that felt like a pile of papers.</t2692>
<t2693>A bit of light seeped inside through the hole we had just made, but I still couldn't make out the direction, nor could I tell if there was a ceiling above.</t2693> <t2694>The air in here was so stifling and oppressive that inhaling and exhaling felt almost the same.</t2694>
<t2695>I turned around and my chin hit Ben's forehead. I whispered, even though there was no reason to whisper like that.</t2695> <t2696>"You have a–"</t2696>
<t2697>"No," Ben whispered back before I finished my sentence.</t2697>
<t2698>"Radar, do you have a flashlight?"</t2698>
<t2699>I heard the sound of Radar climbing in.</t2699> <t2700>“There’s one on my keychain, but it’s not very bright.”</t2700>
<t2701>The light shone in, I still couldn't see anything clearly, but it could be said that we were in a large room, filled with a labyrinth of iron shelves.</t2701> <t2702>The pile of papers on the floor was from a daily torn calendar, the scattered pages falling all over the room, all yellowed and gnawed by mice.</t2702> <t2703>I wondered if this place had ever been a small bookstore, though decades had passed and there was nothing on the shelves but dust.</t2703>
<t2704>We walked in single file behind Radar.</t2704> <t2705>I heard a creaking sound above, and we all stopped.</t2705> <t2706>Trying to swallow the feeling of panic, I could hear every breath of Radar and Ben, every rustling step.</t2706> <t2707>I wanted to get out of this place, but it could be Margo signaling to me.</t2707> <t2708>It could also be the cunning addicts.</t2708>
<t2709>“It's just the building settling down after that little shake,” Radar whispered, but he didn't sound as confident as usual.</t2709> <t2710>I stood frozen.</t2710> <t2711>A moment later, I heard Ben's voice. “The last time I was this scared, I nearly peed my pants.”</t2711>
<t2712>"The last time I was this scared," Radar chimed in, "I actually had to face the Dark Lord for the safety of the wizarding world."</t2712>
<t2713>I made a feeble effort.</t2713> <t2714>"The last time I was this scared, I had to sleep in my mother's room."</t2714>
<t2715>Ben chuckled.</t2715> <t2716>"Q, if I were you, I would want to be this scared Every. Night."</t2716>
<t2717>I wasn't in the mood to laugh, but the laughter of the two made the room feel safer, and we began to explore.</t2717> <t2718>The three of us walked past each row of iron shelves, seeing nothing but a few issues of Reader’s Digest from the 1970s on the floor.</t2718> <t2719>After a while, our eyes adjusted to the darkness, and in the dim light, we began to move in different directions, at different paces.</t2719>
<t2720>“No one leaves this room until we all leave together, okay?” I whispered the agreement, and the other two whispered their consent.</t2720> <t2721>I approached a partition wall in the room and discovered the first evidence that someone had entered here after the building was abandoned.</t2721> <t2722>A jagged semicircular hole, about waist-high, had been chiseled through the wall.</t2722> <t2723>The words DEMON HOLE were spray-painted in orange above it, with an arrow helpfully pointing down to the hole below.</t2723> <t2724>“Hey,” Radar called out, loud enough that it seemed to shatter for a moment.</t2724> <t2725>I walked towards the sound and saw Radar standing in front of another section of wall, flashlight illuminating another Demon Hole.</t2725> <t2726>The graffiti style didn’t particularly resemble Margo’s, but it was hard to be certain.</t2726> <t2727>I had only seen her spray-paint a single letter.</t2727>
<t2728>Radar shone the light through the hole while I bent down and crawled through first.</t2728> <t2729>The room on this side was completely empty, except for a rolled-up carpet in the corner.</t2729> <t2730>When the light shone on the floor, I saw glue streaks still on the concrete, where there must have been a carpet before.</t2730> <t2731>Looking across the room, I saw another vent hole on the wall, this time without any writing.</t2731>
<t2732>I crawled through that Devil's Hole into a room with rows of clothes hooks, the stainless steel posts still sturdy amidst the water-stained, patchy walls.</t2732> <t2733>This room was brighter; it took me a moment to realize it was because of several holes in the roof—the tarred paper had worn away, and I could see the spots where the roof pressed against the now-exposed iron beams.</t2733>
<t2734>“Souvenir shop,” Ben whispered in front of me, and I immediately realized he was right.</t2734>
<t2735>In the middle of the room, there were five display cabinets arranged in a pentagon shape.</t2735> <t2736>The glass that once separated tourists from the useless souvenirs was mostly shattered, with shards of glass scattered around the cabinets.</t2736> <t2737>The gray paint peeled off the walls into amusing patterns, each cracked polygon forming the shape of a withered snowflake.</t2737>
<t2738>But strangely, there were still some traces of commerce: a Mickey Mouse phone, the kind I had seen when I was a kid.</t2738> <t2739>Some ORLANDO SUNSHINE t-shirts, nibbled by cockroaches but still folded and displayed, mixed with broken glass shards.</t2739> <t2740>Under the glass cabinet, Radar found a box full of maps and travel books, advertising Gator World, Crystal Gardens, and those now-defunct funhouses.</t2740> <t2741>Ben waved at me, silently pointing to a green glass alligator souvenir, lying alone in a display case, almost buried in dust.</t2741> <t2742>This is the value of souvenirs, I thought to myself: we can never throw them away.</t2742>
<t2743>We went back, through the empty room and the room with many iron shelves, crawling through the last Devil's Hole.</t2743> <t2744>This area looked like an office, except there were no computers, and it seemed to have been abandoned hastily, as if the employees had been suddenly abducted into space or something like that.</t2744> <t2745>Twenty desks arranged in four rows.</t2745> <t2746>Here and there were some pens on the desks, and each desk still had large wall calendars.</t2746> <t2747>All the calendars stopped at February 1986.</t2747> <t2748>Ben pushed a fabric-covered chair, the swivel chair creaking rhythmically.</t2748> <t2749>Thousands of note pads advertising Martin-Gale Mortgage Company were piled next to a desk, forming a wobbly pyramid.</t2749> <t2750>Uncovered boxes, containing stacks of paper from ancient dot matrix printers, held the financial statistics of Martin-Gale Mortgage Company.</t2750> <t2751>On another desk, someone had arranged brochures of subdivisions into the shape of a one-story house.</t2751> <t2752>I knocked over the brochures, hoping they held some clue, but they didn't.</t2752>
<t2753>Radar ran his finger through the pile of papers and said quietly, “Nothing after 1986.” I started looking through the desk drawers.</t2753> <t2754>There were cotton swabs and tie pins.</t2754> <t2755>Pens and pencils by the dozen in rickety cardboard boxes, printed and styled old look. Napkin.</t2755> <t2756>A pair of golf gloves.</t2756>
<t2757>"Have you two seen anything that indicates someone has been here in the last, let's see, twenty years or so?" I asked.</t2757> <t2758>"Nothing except the Ghouls," Ben replied.</t2758> <t2759>This place is a tomb, everything lies still under the dust.</t2759>
<t2760>“So why did Margo bring us here?” Radar asked.</t2760> <t2761>We could speak normally now, no longer whispering.</t2761>
<t2762>"I don't know," I replied.</t2762> <t2763>Clearly, Margo is not here.</t2763>
<t2764>“There are a few places with less dust,” Radar said.</t2764> <t2765>“A dust-free rectangle in an otherwise empty room, as if something had been moved.</t2765> <t2766>But I don't know.”</t2766>
<t2767>"And there are some painted spots," Ben added.</t2767> <t2768>Ben pointed, and Radar's light followed, illuminating a patch in the far corner of this office wall.</t2768> <t2769>The patch was covered with primer, as if someone had the idea to redesign this place but abandoned the project after about half an hour.</t2769> <t2770>I approached the patch, and up close, I saw red graffiti under the white paint.</t2770> <t2771>But I could only see glimpses of red seeping through the white—almost impossible to discern what it was.</t2771> <t2772>A can of primer was right next to the wall, still open.</t2772> <t2773>I knelt down and dipped my finger into the paint.</t2773> <t2774>The surface of the paint had hardened, but it easily cracked, and when I pulled my finger out, it was completely covered in white.</t2774> <t2775>As drops of paint fell from my finger, I said nothing because we all reached the same conclusion: someone had been here recently.</t2775> <t2776>The creaking sound echoed again somewhere in the building, and Radar dropped his flashlight.</t2776>
<t2777>"Disgusting," he muttered angrily.</t2777>
<t2778>“Look,” Ben exclaimed.</t2778> <t2779>The flashlight was still on the floor, I stepped back to pick it up, but at that moment I saw what Ben was pointing at.</t2779> <t2780>He was pointing at a section of the wall.</t2780> <t2781>The play of reflected light had revealed some graffiti letters, making them stand out from the white paint covering them, the eerie handwriting I immediately recognized as Margo's.</t2781>
<t2782>WILL COME TO PAPER CITIES</t2782>
<t2783>AND WILL NEVER RETURN</t2783>
<t2784>I picked up the flashlight and shone it directly on the paint, the message immediately disappeared.</t2784> <t2785>But when I shone the light on other parts of the wall in the room, I could read those letters again.</t2785> <t2786>"What the hell," Radar said under his breath.</t2786>
<t2787>And now Ben spoke up, "Guys, can we go now?</t2787> <t2788>Because the last time I was this scared... damn it, I'm scared out of my wits here.</t2788> <t2789>This game is no fun at all."</t2789>
<t2790>This game is not fun at all, it's the closest way Ben can reach the horror I'm feeling, perhaps.</t2790> <t2791>And for me, that's close enough.</t2791> <t2792>I quickly walked towards the Devil's Hole.</t2792>
<t2793>It feels like the walls are closing in behind us.</t2793>
<t2794>10.</t2794>
<t2795>Ben and Radar dropped me off at home—those two were willing to skip school but definitely wouldn't miss band practice.</t2795> <t2796>I sat alone for a long time with "Song of Myself."</t2796> <t2797>It must have been the tenth time I tried to read the entire poem from start to finish, but the problem was that the poem was about eighty pages long, convoluted, and repetitive.</t2797> <t2798>Even though I understood each individual word, when combined into a whole, I just couldn't make sense of it.</t2798> <t2799>Even knowing that perhaps only the marked parts were important, I still wanted to figure out whether this was a kind of suicide note poetry.</t2799> <t2800>But I still couldn't make any sense of it.</t2800>
<t2801>After reading a dozen pages of the book, feeling utterly confused, I decided to call the detective.</t2801> <t2802>I retrieved his business card from the pocket of my shorts, which I had tossed into the dirty laundry basket.</t2802> <t2803>He picked up on the second ring.</t2803>
<t2804>"Warren, listen."</t2804>
<t2805>"Uh, yes, I am Quentin Jacobsen, a friend of Margo Roth Spiegelman, do you remember me?"</t2805>
<t2806>“I remember, son.</t2806> <t2807>What's the matter?”</t2807>
<t2808>I told him about the clues, the mini shopping mall, about the paper towns and how Margo called Orlando a paper town when we looked down from the SunTrust building, but she didn't use the plural form.</t2808> <t2809>I recounted how Margo told me that she didn't want to be found, and to look for her under the soles of boots.</t2809> <t2810>He didn't even raise his voice to tell me not to go into abandoned buildings, nor did he ask why I was in an abandoned building at 10 AM on a school day.</t2810> <t2811>He just waited until I finished speaking before saying, "Good Lord, boy, you're almost a detective already.</t2811> <t2812>Now you just need a gun, a detective's intuition, and three ex-wives.</t2812> <t2813>So what's your hypothesis?"</t2813>
<t2814>"It's possible that Margo, um, I'm afraid she might have committed suicide."</t2814>
<t2815>“In my mind, I always believed that the girl just ran away, son.</t2815> <t2816>I understand your reasoning, but you should also remember that the girl has behaved like this before.</t2816> <t2817>I mean the clues that were left behind.</t2817> <t2818>Adding more drama to the whole process.</t2818> <t2819>Honestly, son, if Margo wants you to find her—alive or dead—then you will find her.”</t2819>
<t2820>“But you don't–”</t2820>
<t2821>"Son, the unfortunate thing is that Margo is already a legally recognized adult, with a free will, you understand? My advice to you is this: let her come back on her own."</t2821> <t2822>"What I mean is that eventually, you will stop looking up at the sky, or one of these days, you will look down and realize that you yourself have drifted away."</t2822>
<t2823>I put the phone down with an uncomfortable feeling in my mouth—I realized that Dr. Warren's poetic substance would not lead me to Margo. I pondered over the last lines that Margo had underlined: "I give myself back to the earth, nourishing the grasses I love, / If you want me, look for me under your boot-soles."</t2823> <t2824>That grass, Whitman wrote in the first pages, is "the beautiful uncut hair of graves."</t2824> <t2825>But where are the graves?</t2825> <t2826>Where are the paper towns?</t2826>
<t2827>I logged into the Encyclopedia of Everything to see if there was any information about "paper towns" that I didn't know.</t2827> <t2828>There was an extremely insightful and useful entry from a user named mongchonhoi: "A Paper Town is a town where there is a paper mill."</t2828> <t2829>This is the downside of the Encyclopedia of Everything: the things Radar writes are extremely detailed and absolutely useful; while mongchonhoi's crude work only teases the issue, leaving people wanting more.</t2829> <t2830>But when I searched more broadly across the internet, I found about forty interesting entries, buried deep within a real estate forum in Kansas.</t2830>
<t2831>It seems that the Madison real estate area will never be completed; my spouse and I placed an order for a house there, but during the week someone called us, informing that our deposit would be refunded because they couldn't sell enough houses in advance to fund the project.</t2831> <t2832>Another paper city for Kansas!</t2832><t2833>–Marge in Cawker, KS A ghost town!</t2833> <t2834>They will come to ghost towns and will never return.</t2834> <t2835>I took a deep breath and stared at the computer screen for a while.</t2835>
<t2836>It seemed impossible to avoid that outcome.</t2836> <t2837>Even though everything inside her had shattered and reached a verdict, Margo seemingly did not allow herself to disappear forever.</t2837> <t2838>And she decided to leave her body behind–leave it for me–in the guise of our ghost town, where her first threads had snapped.</t2838> <t2839>Margo had said that she didn't want her body to be found by random children–and it could be understood that among those who knew her, Margo would choose me to be the one to find her.</t2839> <t2840>She would not hurt me in a new way.</t2840> <t2841>I had done that before.</t2841> <t2842>I have experience in this field.</t2842>
<t2843>I saw Radar was online, intended to call it to talk, then saw its message appear on my screen.</t2843>
<t2844>GLOBALCITIZENOFTHETOTALBOOK96: Êu.</t2844>
<t2845>QKẺHỒISINH: Paper towns = ghost towns.</t2845> <t2846>I think Margo wanted me to find her body.</t2846> <t2847>Because she thought I could handle it.</t2847> <t2848>Because when we were kids, we discovered a dead body.</t2848>
<t2849>I sent the link to Radar.</t2849>
<t2850>CITIZENOFTHEUNIVERSE96: Hold on, let me read from the link first.</t2850>
<t2851>QKẺHỒISINH: Yes.</t2851>
<t2852>CITIZENOFTHEWORLD96: Alright, don't overthink it.</t2852> <t2853>You still don't have anything certain yet.</t2853> <t2854>I think Margo will be fine.</t2854>
<t2855>QKẺHỒISINH: Don't fool me.</t2855>
<t2856>CITIZENOFTHEWORLD96: Alright, I won't deceive you.</t2856> <t2857>But if there is someone still alive regardless of this evidence...</t2857>
<t2858>QKẺHỒISINH: Yeah, let's say so.</t2858> <t2859>I'm going to lie down for a bit, my parents are coming home soon.</t2859>
<t2860>But I couldn't stay calm, so I lay on the bed and called Ben, telling him my hypothesis.</t2860>
<t2861>"You're overthinking it, driving yourself crazy.</t2861> <t2862>But Margo is fine.</t2862> <t2863>It's all just part of some game she's playing.</t2863><t2864>"</t2864>
<t2865>"You are starting to become indifferent about this."</t2865>
<t2866>Ben sighed.</t2866> <t2867>"Anyway, Margo played, well, a bit unfairly.</t2867> <t2868>You see, out of nowhere, she launched a surprise attack in the last three weeks of high school.</t2868> <t2869>You also saw, Margo made everyone worried, Lacey freaked out, and the prom is only three days away.</t2869> <t2870>Can't we have a fun graduation prom?”</t2870>
<t2871>“Are you serious?”</t2871> <t2872>“Margo might be dead, Ben.”</t2872><t2873>”</t2873>
<t2874>“He won't die.</t2874> <t2875>Margo is the queen of making things up.</t2875> <t2876>She wants attention. I know Margo's parents aren't great, but they know Margo better than we do, right? And they think the same way.”</t2876>
<t2877>“You are a loser,” I cursed.</t2877>
<t2878>"You can say whatever you want."</t2878> <t2879>"Both of us just had a long day."</t2879> <t2880>"Too much drama."</t2880> <t2881>"I'm going to GTSY."</t2881> <t2882>I was about to tease him about using such internet slang, but I didn't have the energy to joke anymore.</t2882>
<t2883>After hanging up with Ben, I went back online, looking for a list of ghost towns in Florida. I didn't find any such list, but after searching for "abandoned subdivisions" and "Grovepoint Acres," something similar, I gathered a list of five locations within about a three-hour drive from Jefferson Park.</t2883> <t2884>I printed out a map of Central Florida, pinned it to the wall above my computer, and marked those five places with pushpins.</t2884> <t2885>Looking at the map, I didn't see any connection.</t2885> <t2886>Those locations were scattered in remote suburbs, and it would probably take at least a week to visit them all.</t2886> <t2887>Why didn't Margo narrow it down to a specific area for me?</t2887> <t2888>All these creepy-to-the-point-of-gross clues.</t2888> <t2889>All this proximity to disaster.</t2889> <t2890>But not a single place.</t2890> <t2891>Nothing to hold on to.</t2891> <t2892>Like having to climb a mountain full of loose rocks.</t2892>
<t2893>The next day, Ben lent me RHAPAW because he would be driving Lacey's SUV around to shop for the graduation party.</t2893> <t2894>So this time I didn't have to wait outside the music room–as soon as the bell rang to end the seventh period, I dashed to the car.</t2894> <t2895>But I couldn't start RHAPAW as easily as Ben, so even though I was one of the first to arrive at the senior parking lot, I was one of the last to leave.</t2895> <t2896>Eventually, the engine did start, and I headed straight to Grovepoint Acres.</t2896>
<t2897>I drove along Colonial Road, slowly driving to see if there was any ghost town I had missed when searching online.</t2897> <t2898>A long line of cars followed behind my car.</t2898> <t2899>I felt a bit flustered seeing that scene, then immediately admired myself for still having the energy to worry about such childish, trivial, and silly things: wondering if the guy in the SUV behind me thought I was an overly cautious driver, driving as slow as a turtle.</t2899> <t2900>I had hoped that Margo's disappearance would change me; but it didn't change much, not significantly.</t2900>
<t2901>When the line of cars behind kept stretching out like an unwilling funeral procession, I realized I was speaking loudly to her.</t2901> <t2902>I will follow the connection.</t2902> <t2903>I will not betray your trust.</t2903> <t2904>I will find you.</t2904>
<t2905>Strangely, speaking out loud like that made me calmer.</t2905> <t2906>I no longer conjured up hypotheses.</t2906> <t2907>Passing the old wooden sign that read Grovepoint Acres again, I almost heard a sigh of relief from the bottleneck behind me as I turned left onto the paved dead-end road.</t2907> <t2908>It looked like a path that didn't lead to any house.</t2908> <t2909>I let RHAPAW run the entire length of that road.</t2909> <t2910>Up close, Grovepoint Acres seemed more complete than it initially appeared.</t2910> <t2911>Two dirt roads led into a cul-de-sac, intersecting each other into dusty patches.</t2911> <t2912>Although the roads were heavily eroded, I could still faintly see the edges.</t2912> <t2913>Walking back and forth on those two streets, I felt the heat emanating from my nostrils with each breath. The sun was scorching, making the walk quite tiring, but I understood a beautiful, albeit slightly foolish, truth: the heat would force the smell of death to rise, and Grovepoint Acres only emitted the scent of heated air and car exhaust—the accumulated emissions pushed down close to the ground by the humidity.</t2913>
<t2914>I searched for evidence that Margo had been here: footprints, something written on the ground, or some kind of memento.</t2914> <t2915>But it seemed that after many years, I was the first person to set foot on these nameless dusty streets.</t2915> <t2916>The ground was flat, and the shrubs had not grown much, so I could see in all directions.</t2916> <t2917>No tents.</t2917> <t2918>No signs of fire.</t2918> <t2919>No Margo.</t2919>
<t2920>I turned back to RHAPAW, drove onto the I-4 highway, and then headed northeast of the city to a place called Holly Meadows.</t2920> <t2921>I drove past Holly Meadows three times before actually finding it—the entire area was just oak trees and vacant land, and Holly Meadows—with no sign at the entrance—wasn't very noticeable.</t2921> <t2922>I drove a few meters along the dirt road through the first cluster of oak and pine trees, and this place seemed no less desolate than Grovepoint Acres.</t2922> <t2923>The main dirt road gradually blurred into a field of soil.</t2923> <t2924>I didn't see any other roads, but as I went around, I did see some painted wooden stakes lying scattered on the ground; they probably once marked the boundaries.</t2924> <t2925>I didn't smell or detect anything suspicious, yet I still felt a fear rising in my chest.</t2925> <t2926>At first, I didn't understand why, but then I realized: when they cleared the land for construction, they left a single oak tree at the far end of the field.</t2926> <t2927>And the twisted trunk with its thick bark looked very much like the tree from long ago in Jefferson Park, where we had found Robert Joyner, so much so that I was almost certain Margo was there, behind the trunk.</t2927>
<t2928>And for the first time, I had to imagine this: Margo Roth Spiegelman, slumped against a tree, her eyes vacant, black blood pouring from her mouth, everything swollen and deformed because I had taken too long to find her.</t2928> <t2929>Margo had believed that I would find her sooner.</t2929> <t2930>That night she had placed her trust in me.</t2930> <t2931>And I had betrayed that trust.</t2931> <t2932>And although the air only smelled of impending rain, I was certain that I would find Margo there.</t2932>
<t2933>But no.</t2933> <t2934>There was only the tree, solitary on the silver-gray ground.</t2934> <t2935>I crouched down, leaning against the tree trunk and tried to catch my breath. I hated having to go through this alone.</t2935> <t2936>I hated it.</t2936> <t2937>If Margo thought that the Robert Joyner incident had prepared me, she was wrong.</t2937> <t2938>I didn't know Robert Joyner. I didn't have any affection for Robert Joyner.</t2938>
<t2939>I pounded my fist into the ground, punching repeatedly, sand swirling up until I hit the exposed roots of a tree.</t2939> <t2940>I still didn't stop, the sharp pain shooting through my hand and wrist.</t2940> <t2941>I had never cried because of Margo, until then, now I couldn't hold back anymore.</t2941> <t2942>I kept pounding the ground and screaming because there was no one here to hear: I miss Margo, miss her, miss, miss, miss.</t2942>
<t2943>I stayed there until my arms went numb and my eyes dried out, just sitting there thinking about her, until day turned to night.</t2943>
<t2944>11.</t2944>
<t2945>The next morning at school, I saw Ben standing next to the music room, talking to Lacey, Radar, and Angela under a low-hanging tree canopy.</t2945> <t2946>I had no interest in listening to them discuss the prom, or things like how Lacey had a huge fight with Becca.</t2946> <t2947>I waited for the moment to tell them what I had seen, but when that moment came, I ended up saying only, "Yesterday I thoroughly checked out two ghost towns but found nothing noteworthy."</t2947> <t2948>In fact, I felt there was nothing new to tell them.</t2948>
<t2949>None of them seemed to care, except for Lacey.</t2949> <t2950>She shook her head when I mentioned ghost towns, then said, "Last night I read online that people who choose to commit suicide often cut ties with those who have made them angry before.</t2950> <t2951>And they give away their belongings.</t2951> <t2952>Last week Margo gave me five pairs of jeans, she said I looked better in them, but actually, it was just flattery, Margo has, um, much better curves than I do."</t2952> <t2953>I liked Lacey, but I also remembered what Margo had said about her liking to "put down" her friends.</t2953>
<t2954>It seems that recounting that story made Lacey so emotional that she started to cry.</t2954> <t2955>Ben put his arm around Lacey and she rested her head on his shoulder, which was actually a bit difficult because when wearing high heels, Lacey was slightly taller than Ben.</t2955>
<t2956>“It's okay, Lacey, we just have to find the right place.</t2956> <t2957>Try talking to our friends and see what they say.</t2957> <t2958>Did Margo ever mention anything about the paper towns to anyone?</t2958> <t2959>Did she ever talk about any specific locations?</t2959> <t2960>Is there a particular subdivision somewhere that holds special meaning for Margo?” Lacey nestled deeper into Ben's shoulder.</t2960>
<t2961>“Alright, don't rush Lacey too much,” Ben said.</t2961> <t2962>I sighed, saying nothing more.</t2962>
<t2963>“I have been following online,” Radar said, “but Margo's username hasn't logged into Omnictionary since she left.”</t2963>
<t2964>Then immediately the whole group returned to the topic of the graduation party.</t2964> <t2965>Lacey lifted her head from Ben's shoulder, still looking downcast and distracted, but tried to smile as she listened to Radar and Ben discussing boutonnieres.</t2965>
<t2966>The day passed like any other day—slowly, with a thousand weary glances at the clock.</t2966> <t2967>But now everything was even more unbearable, because every minute I wasted at school was another minute I failed to find Margo.</t2967>
<t2968>The only somewhat exciting class for me that day was National Language.</t2968> <t2969>Ms. Holden completely ruined Moby Dick for me by assuming that we had all read the book.</t2969> <t2970>She innocently lectured about Captain Ahab with his passion for hunting down some white whale.</t2970> <t2971>But watching her get more and more engrossed in her lecture was quite interesting.</t2971> <t2972>“Ahab is a madman sailing against fate.</t2972> <t2973>Throughout the entire novel, you don’t see him pursuing anything else, right?</t2973> <t2974>He has only one obsession.</t2974> <t2975>And because he is the captain, no one on the ship can stop him.</t2975> <t2976>You could argue—and surely you could make your own argument if you choose to write about him in your final essay—that Ahab is a mad fool because of that passion.</t2976> <t2977>But you could also argue that there is something epic and tragic about Ahab engaging in a battle he is certain to lose.</t2977> <t2978>Is Ahab’s hope a form of desperate madness, or is it a powerful embodiment of humanity?” I quickly scribbled down as much as I could of Ms. Holden’s words, realizing that I could neatly submit my final paper without actually reading the entire book.</t2978> <t2979>While listening to the lecture, I suddenly realized that Ms. Holden had an extraordinary ability to understand literature.</t2979> <t2980>She also once mentioned that she liked Whitman.</t2980> <t2981>So when the bell rang, I took out Leaves of Grass and slowly flipped through it while the other students either left or went to do some extracurricular activities.</t2981> <t2982>I waited behind a student who was asking for an extension on a late assignment, and then they left the classroom.</t2982>
<t2983>“Here is my Whitman fan reader,” she said to me.</t2983>
<t2984>I forced a smile.</t2984> <t2985>"Do you know Margo Roth Spiegelman?" I asked.</t2985>
<t2986>She sat down at the table and moved aside to make room for me. "Margo never registered for my class," Ms. Holden said, "but I certainly have heard of her.</t2986> <t2987>I also know that she has left."</t2987>
<t2988>“She left me this book before she, uh, disappeared.”</t2988> <t2989>I handed over the book, and Ms. Holden began to slowly turn each page.</t2989> <t2990>Meanwhile, I continued, “I’ve thought a lot about the highlighted passages.</t2990> <t2991>If you look at the end of the poem ‘Song of Myself,’ you’ll see that Margo highlighted the lines about death.</t2991> <t2992>Like the line ‘If you want me, look for me under your boot-soles.’”</t2992>
<t2993>“Did he leave the book for you?” Miss Holden said softly.</t2993>
<t2994>"Yes," I replied.</t2994>
<t2995>Ms. Holden flipped back, her fingertip pointing to the section marked in green. "What about the part about these doors?"</t2995> <t2996>"A brilliant moment in the entire poem, when Whitman—it feels like he's speaking directly to you: 'Open the doors! Throw the doors wide open!'"</t2996>
<t2997>"Indeed, Margo left something else in the door frame of my room."</t2997>
<t2998>Ms. Holden burst out laughing. "Wow!</t2998> <t2999>That's clever!</t2999> <t3000>But this is truly a great poem—I don't like to just understand it in a purely literal sense.</t3000> <t3001>It seems that Margo had a somewhat ambiguous reaction to a poem that is actually very optimistic and cheerful.</t3001> <t3002>This poem talks about the connection that binds us together—we all share the same root system, like blades of grass."</t3002>
<t3003>“But with the marked passages, it seems like Margo also had a death wish, ma'am.” I said.</t3003> <t3004>Ms. Holden reread the final stanzas and then looked at me.</t3004>
<t3005>“Imputing a sense of despair to this poem is a mistake.</t3005> <t3006>I hope that’s not the case here, Quentin.</t3006> <t3007>If you read the entire poem, I don’t think you could come to any conclusion other than recognizing that life is sacred and precious. But—who knows.</t3007> <t3008>Maybe Margo just picked out the parts she needed to find.</t3008> <t3009>Sometimes we do read poetry that way.</t3009> <t3010>But if that’s the case, then Margo completely misunderstood what Whitman expected of his readers.”</t3010>
<t3011>"And what is that expectation?"</t3011>
<t3012>Ms. Holden closed the book, looking straight at me with eyes that made me too embarrassed to look back.</t3012> <t3013>"What do you think it is?"</t3013>
<t3014>“I don't know,” I replied, my eyes glued to the stack of graded papers on her desk. “Countless times I've tried to read and understand, but I never get very far.</t3014> <t3015>Mostly, I just read the highlighted parts.</t3015> <t3016>I read to try to understand Margo, not to try to understand Whitman.”</t3016>
<t3017>She took a pencil and wrote something on the back of an envelope.</t3017>
<t3018>"Wait a minute. I am rewriting that idea."</t3018>
<t3019>“What?”</t3019>
<t3020>“What you just said,” she explained.</t3020>
<t3021>“Why?”</t3021>
<t3022>"Because I believe that is exactly what Whitman intended.</t3022> <t3023>For you to see that 'Song of Myself' is not just a poem but also a way to understand others.</t3023> <t3024>But I don't know if you can read it like an ordinary poem, rather than just reading excerpts and looking for clues.</t3024> <t3025>I truly believe there are interesting connections between the poet in 'Song of Myself' and Margo Spiegelman—all those wild personalities and the wandering spirit.</t3025> <t3026>But a poem cannot be complete if you only read fragments of it."</t3026>
<t3027>"Yes, thank you, ma'am," I said, taking the book and standing up.</t3027> <t3028>I didn't feel much better.</t3028>
<t3029>In the afternoon, I went home with Ben and stayed at his place until he had to go pick up Radar for a pre-prom party at Jake's, our friend's house, since Jake's parents were not home.</t3029> <t3030>Ben invited me to go along, but I wasn't very interested.</t3030>
<t3031>I walked home, passing through the park where Margo and I had found the man who had committed suicide years ago.</t3031> <t3032>I still remember that morning, and my stomach suddenly churned at the memory—not because of the dead body, but because I recalled that she had found him first.</t3032> <t3033>Even in the playground near my house, I had never found a dead body myself—so now, what the hell am I supposed to do?</t3033>
<t3034>I tried to read "Tự khúc" again when I was at home that night, but despite Ms. Holden's advice, the poem still jumbled into a bunch of meaningless words.</t3034>
<t3035>The next morning, I woke up early, just after eight o'clock, and immediately turned on the computer.</t3035> <t3036>Ben was online, so I sent him a message right away.</t3036>
<t3037>QKẺHỒISINH: How was the party yesterday?</t3037>
<t3038>CHỈVIÊMTHẬNTHUIMÀ: Boring, of course.</t3038> <t3039>Every party I go to is boring.</t3039>
<t3040>QKẺHỒISINH: Sorry, I can't go with you.</t3040> <t3041>Woke up early today.</t3041> <t3042>Come over, want to play Resurrection?</t3042>
<t3043>CHRONICNEPHRITIS: Are you kidding?</t3043>
<t3044>QKẺHỒISINH: Uh... no.</t3044> <t3045>Why?</t3045>
<t3046>CHỈVIÊMTHẬNTHUIMÀ: Don't you know what day it is today?</t3046><t3047>?</t3047>
<t3048>QKẺHỒISINH: Saturday, May 15. Why?</t3048>
<t3049>CHỈVIÊMTHẬNTHUIMÀ: Hey brother, the graduation banquet will start in eleven hours and fourteen minutes.</t3049> <t3050>In less than nine hours, I have to pick up Lacey.</t3050> <t3051>And I haven't even cleaned her RHAPAW, after the feat of getting dirt all over her.</t3051> <t3052>Then I still have to shower, shave, trim my nose hair, and spruce myself up.</t3052> <t3053>Oh my God, so much work and I haven't even started anything yet. Super busy.</t3053> <t3054>Listen, I'll call you later, if I can find a moment.</t3054>
<t3055>Radar is also online, I continue to message it.</t3055>
<t3056>QKẺHỒISINH: Ben, what did you eat by mistake?</t3056>
<t3057>CITIZENOFTHETOTALBOOK96: Hựa, what's wrong?</t3057>
<t3058>QKẺHỒISINH: Sorry, I'm upset because that monkey messed up the oh-so-important gala dinner.</t3058>
<t3059>CITIZENOFTHETOTALBOOK96: He would be even more upset if he knew the only reason I got up this early is because I really have to leave now, as I need to go get my tailcoat.</t3059> <t3060>Getting upset yet?</t3060>
<t3061>QKẺHỒISINH: Dear merciful Lord, are you being serious?</t3061>
<t3062>CITIZENOFTHETOTALBOOK96: Q, tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, the day after that, and all the remaining days of my life, I will be honored to participate in your investigation.</t3062> <t3063>But I have a girlfriend.</t3063> <t3064>She wants to have a perfect prom night.</t3064> <t3065>I want to have a perfect prom night.</t3065> <t3066>It's not my fault if Margo Roth Spiegelman doesn't want us to have a perfect prom night.</t3066>
<t3067>I don't know what to say.</t3067> <t3068>Maybe Radar was right.</t3068> <t3069>Maybe Margo deserves to be forgotten.</t3069> <t3070>But from any angle, I can't forget her.</t3070>
<t3071>Mom and Dad are still in bed, watching an old movie on TV.</t3071> <t3072>"Can I take the car?" I asked.</t3072>
<t3073>"Sure, what's the matter, dear?"</t3073>
<t3074>“I've changed my mind, I'll go to the party,” I replied quickly.</t3074> <t3075>The lie just slipped out as I opened my mouth.</t3075> <t3076>“I'll go pick out a suit and then head over to Ben's place, we'll go together.”</t3076> <t3077>Mom immediately sat up, a smile spreading across her face.</t3077>
<t3078>"That's more like it, that's good."</t3078> <t3079>"You two have fun together, are you coming home so that your parents can take a commemorative photo?"</t3079>
<t3080>"Mom, do you really need evidence photos of me going to a party? Isn't my life pathetic enough already?" Mom laughed heartily.</t3080>
<t3081>"Call before curfew," Dad reminded, which means before midnight.</t3081>
<t3082>"Definitely," I replied.</t3082> <t3083>The lie to my parents was so smooth that I wondered why I had never utilized this ability before the night I went with Margo.</t3083>
<t3084>I entered the I-4 highway, heading west towards Kissimmee and the theme parks, passing I-Drive where Margo and I had sneaked into SeaWorld, then followed Highway 27 down to the city of Haines.</t3084> <t3085>This area has many lakes, and in Florida, wherever there are lakes, the wealthy tend to gather, so this place is unlikely to be suitable for a ghost town.</t3085> <t3086>But the website I checked had specifically mentioned that there was a large foreclosed property that had long been abandoned and untouched for development.</t3086> <t3087>I immediately recognized that lot, because every subdivision along the road had walls, while Quail Hollow only had a plastic sign stuck in the ground.</t3087> <t3088>When I arrived, I read the flyers advertising LAND FOR SALE, IDEAL LOCATION, and OPPORTUNITY TO BOOST $</t3088><t3089>!</t3089>
<t3090>Unlike previous ghost towns, Quail Hollow has someone looking after it.</t3090> <t3091>No houses have been built yet, but the lots are marked with boundary stakes, and the grass has been freshly cut.</t3091> <t3092>The streets in this area are paved and properly named.</t3092> <t3093>In the center of the subdivision, a perfectly round lake has been dug, but for some reason, no water has been led into it yet.</t3093> <t3094>Driving by, I estimated the lake to be about three meters deep, with a diameter of over a hundred meters.</t3094> <t3095>A rubber pipe runs windingly inside the lake, connected to the center, where a fountain made of aluminum and steel is erected from the bottom up to eye level.</t3095> <t3096>I was glad the lake was dry, meaning I didn't have to stare at the water, wondering if Margo was at the bottom, waiting for me to dive in and find her.</t3096>
<t3097>I feel certain that Margo is not at Quail Hollow. This place is surrounded by too many subdivisions, it can't be an ideal spot to hide, whether alive or dead.</t3097> <t3098>But I still examined it carefully, and as I sat in the car absentmindedly looking down the streets, I felt truly hopeless.</t3098> <t3099>I almost wanted to be glad that it wasn't this place.</t3099> <t3100>But if it's not Quail Hollow, then it could be the next location, or the one after that, or the one after that again.</t3100> <t3101>Or maybe I will never find Margo.</t3101> <t3102>Is that a better fate?</t3102>
<t3103>In conclusion, there was nothing at Quail Hollow, so I got back on the highway.</t3103> <t3104>I bought lunch at a drive-in, eating while driving west, heading to the mini shopping center from the other day.</t3104>
<t3105>12.</t3105>
<t3106>When I pulled into the parking lot next to the mini shopping area, I noticed that someone had covered the hole we made in the plywood the other day with thick blue tape.</t3106> <t3107>I wonder who was here after we left.</t3107>
<t3108>I drove to the back, parked next to a large rusty dumpster that hadn't seen a garbage truck in decades.</t3108> <t3109>I figured if necessary, I would just push through the tape, so I started to walk around to the front but then noticed that the metal back doors weren't attached to any hinges.</t3109>
<t3110>Thanks to Margo, I gained a bit of expertise about door hinges and realized why the three of us couldn't pull those doors open: because they all opened inward.</t3110> <t3111>I went to the office door of the mortgage company and pushed in.</t3111> <t3112>The door swung open effortlessly.</t3112> <t3113>My God, the other day all three of us were really clueless.</t3113> <t3114>Surely someone concerned about this building already knew about the unlocked door, so the blue tape on the other side seemed even more redundant.</t3114>
<t3115>I dropped the backpack I had packed since the morning, took out my dad's high-powered Maglite flashlight, and shone it around the room.</t3115> <t3116>It seemed like something large had just scurried away among the beams on the roof.</t3116> <t3117>I shivered.</t3117> <t3118>Some small lizards jumped into the dark corner, avoiding the path of the light.</t3118>
<t3119>The only beam of light through a hole in the ceiling fell into the front corner of the room, and a bit of sunlight peeked through the plywood, but I mostly relied on the flashlight.</t3119> <t3120>I walked back and forth through the rows of tables, looking at the things we had seen in the drawers and left behind.</t3120> <t3121>A creepy feeling surged up terribly as I looked from table to table, each one holding a calendar page without any notes: February 1986.</t3121> <t3122>February 1986.</t3122> <t3123>February 1986. June 1986.</t3123> <t3124>February 1986.</t3124> <t3125>I turned around and shone the light on the table in the middle of the room.</t3125> <t3126>The calendar was turned to June. I leaned in closer and scrutinized the calendar page, hoping to see a ragged edge where the previous months had been torn off, or some mark on the paper indicating that a pen had passed over it, but there was nothing different from the other calendar pages, except the dates.</t3126>
<t3127>Holding the flashlight between my neck and shoulder, I checked the drawers again, paying special attention to the June desk: a few napkins, some still-sharp pencils, notes on the mortgages of a certain Dennis McMahon, an empty pack of Marlboro cigarettes, and a nearly full bottle of red nail polish.</t3127>
<t3128>I switched the flashlight to one hand, held the nail polish bottle in the other, and observed carefully.</t3128> <t3129>The red color was so dark it almost looked black.</t3129> <t3130>I had seen this red color before.</t3130> <t3131>On the dashboard of the minivan that night.</t3131> <t3132>Suddenly, the large creatures lurking on the roof and the creaking sounds in the building no longer mattered–I just felt a strange exhilaration.</t3132> <t3133>Of course, I couldn't know if it was the same bottle of polish, but it was definitely the same shade.</t3133>
<t3134>I rotated the jar and saw, without a doubt, a tiny smudge of sky-blue paint on its surface.</t3134> <t3135>Smeared from Margo's sky-blue paint-stained finger.</t3135> <t3136>Now I could be certain.</t3136> <t3137>She had come here after we said goodbye that morning.</t3137> <t3138>Perhaps she was still here.</t3138> <t3139>Perhaps she would only appear late at night.</t3139> <t3140>Perhaps she had taped the plywood to maintain her privacy.</t3140>
<t3141>I immediately decided that I would stay here until morning.</t3141> <t3142>If Margo could sleep in this place, then I could sleep too.</t3142> <t3143>And thus, a brief self-examination took place.</t3143>
<t3144>Me: There are still those rats.</t3144>
<t3145>Me: Yeah, but it seems like they only parade on the ceiling.</t3145>
<t3146>Me: More lizards.</t3146>
<t3147>Me: Oh well, when I was a kid, I used to pull off lizard tails.</t3147>
<t3148>What is the lizard afraid of?</t3148>
<t3149>Me: But what about the mouse?</t3149>
<t3150>Me: After all, who can a mouse hurt? Mice are more afraid of us than we are of them.</t3150>
<t3151>Me: Well, what about the rats?</t3151>
<t3152>Me: Stop it right now.</t3152>
<t3153>In the end, the actual rats didn't really matter because I was where Margo had been. I was in a place that had seen her after I had seen her, and the warmth from that thought made this mini-mall almost pleasant.</t3153> <t3154>I didn't feel like a child, always having my mother close by, but I still held my breath whenever I heard a strange noise.</t3154> <t3155>And because of the pleasant feeling, this place became easier to explore.</t3155> <t3156>There was much to discover, and now, I was ready.</t3156>
<t3157>I left the office, crawled through a Devil's Hole into the maze-like room of iron shelves.</t3157><t3158>I walked back and forth along the aisle between the rows of shelves for a moment, reached the end of the room, and through the next Devil's Hole into an empty room.</t3158><t3159>I sat down on the rolled-up carpet, leaning against the wall in the corner of the room.</t3159><t3160>The patchy white paint behind me sounded more brittle and cracked.</t3160><t3161>I sat there for a while, long enough for the slanted beam of light from the ceiling to crawl a few inches across the floor, while I gradually adapted to the sounds.</t3161>
<t3162>After a while, I got bored and crawled through the last Ghost Hole into the souvenir room.</t3162> <t3163>I browsed through the T-shirts.</t3163> <t3164>I pulled out the travel book box from under the display case and looked through it, searching to see if Margo had scribbled a few words, but I found nothing.</t3164>
<t3165>I returned to the room I now call the library.</t3165> <t3166>Flipping through the pile of Reader’s Digest magazines, I found a stack of National Geographic issues from the 1960s.</t3166> <t3167>But these items were covered in layers of dust, so I knew Margo had never looked through them.</t3167>
<t3168>It wasn't until I returned to the empty room that I found evidence of human activity.</t3168> <t3169>On the wall near the rolled-up carpet, I discovered nine pinholes on the cracked and peeling painted surface.</t3169> <t3170>Four holes formed a relatively square shape, and within that square, there were five more holes.</t3170> <t3171>I guessed that Margo had probably been here for quite a while, long enough to want to hang some kind of poster, although we didn't find anything missing when we searched her room.</t3171>
<t3172>I had spread the carpet halfway when I discovered something else: an empty, flat-folded box that had once contained twenty-four synthetic nutrition bars.</t3172> <t3173>I began to imagine Margo had been here, leaning against the wall, sitting on the musty rolled-up carpet, eating a nutrition bar.</t3173> <t3174>She was completely alone, with only this to eat.</t3174> <t3175>Maybe every day Margo still drove to the convenience store to buy sandwiches and a few bottles of Mountain Dew, but most of the time she was here, on or near the carpet.</t3175> <t3176>That image seemed too bleak to be true–it all conjured up in my mind a Margo who was too lonely and too unlike-Margo.</t3176> <t3177>But all the evidence from the past ten days pointed to a surprising conclusion: Margo–at least at times–was very unlike Margo.</t3177>
<t3178>I spread out the rest of the carpet and saw a sky-blue knitted wool blanket, thin almost like newspaper.</t3178> <t3179>I hurriedly grabbed it and brought it to my face, yes, thank God, that's right.</t3179> <t3180>The scent of Margo.</t3180> <t3181>Lilac-scented shampoo and almond-scented lotion, with a faint sweetness of skin lingering within.</t3181>
<t3182>I imagine her again: every night Margo spreads this rug halfway so that her hip doesn't press against the hard concrete when she lies on her side.</t3182> <t3183>She curls up under this blanket, resting her head on the part of the rug that isn't fully spread out, and closes her eyes to sleep.</t3183> <t3184>But why here?</t3184> <t3185>What is better about this place than home? If she liked it here so much, why did she leave?</t3185> <t3186>Those things I can't imagine, I realize I can't imagine because I don't understand Margo. I know how she smells, I know how she behaves in front of me, I know how she behaves in front of others, I know she likes Mountain Dew, likes adventure and dramatic games, I also know she is funny, smart, and generally superior to the rest of us.</t3186> <t3187>But I don't know what brought Margo here, what made her stay here, what made her leave.</t3187> <t3188>I don't know why she has thousands of records but never tells anyone how much she loves music.</t3188> <t3189>I don't know what she does every night, behind the discreetly drawn curtains, behind the locked door, in the inviolable private space that is her room.</t3189>
<t3190>And perhaps more than anything, this is what I need to do.</t3190> <t3191>I need to find out what Margo is like when she is not being Margo.</t3191>
<t3192>I lay there for a while in the blanket that smelled of Margo, staring up at the ceiling.</t3192> <t3193>The twilight sky filtered through the crack in the roof, like a canvas torn to reveal a pale blue strip.</t3193> <t3194>This must be the perfect place to fall asleep: at night, you can watch the stars without fearing the rain.</t3194>
<t3195>I called home to report my safety.</t3195> <t3196>Dad answered the phone, I said we were in the car, on the way to Radar and Angela's place, and I would stay with Ben all night.</t3196> <t3197>Dad told me not to drink recklessly, I replied I wouldn't, and he said he was very happy that I went to the prom.</t3197> <t3198>And I wondered if he would still be happy if he really knew what I was doing.</t3198>
<t3199>This place is boring.</t3199> <t3200>Once you've gotten the upper hand over the gang of rodents and deciphered the mysterious groans of the building-about-to-collapse echoing from the walls, there's nothing left to do.</t3200> <t3201>No Internet, no TV, no music.</t3201> <t3202>I'm bored, so I don't understand why Margo chose this place; she always gave the impression that she had very little tolerance for boredom.</t3202> <t3203>Or does she like this dilapidated scene?</t3203> <t3204>Could it be.</t3204> <t3205>With that Margo who wore stylish jeans to break into SeaWorld.</t3205>
<t3206>It was the lack of alternative stimuli that brought me back to "Self-Elegy," the only certain gift I received from Margo.</t3206> <t3207>I went to the floor, stained with long-dried water marks, directly under the hole in the ceiling, sat cross-legged, and leaned to let the light shine down on the page.</t3207> <t3208>In the end, somehow, I managed to read through it.</t3208>
<t3209>The problem is that the poem starts extremely slowly—the introduction drags on and on, and it isn't until the ninth line that Whitman finally begins to reveal the story, and that's where I started to understand.</t3209> <t3210>So Whitman is sitting idly (which he calls being at ease) on the grass, then:</t3210>
<t3211>A child spoke up, What is grass? and brought us a handful;</t3211>
<t3212>How should I answer the child?...</t3212> <t3213>I don't know much more than what the child knows.</t3213>
<t3214>Perhaps that is surely our flag of virtue, woven with the color of hope.</t3214>
<t3215>This is the hope that Ms. Holden mentioned–grass is a metaphor for hope.</t3215> <t3216>But that's not all, the poet continues:</t3216>
<t3217>Or perhaps that is the handkerchief of the Person,</t3217>
<t3218>The gift carries a fragrance, a keepsake bestowed by Him.</t3218>
<t3219>It's like grass is a metaphor for the greatness of God, and there's more...</t3219>
<t3220>Or perhaps grass is just like children...</t3220>
<t3221>And right after that,</t3221>
<t3222>Or perhaps grass is a uniform pictogram,</t3222>
<t3223>Rising up amidst the vast forest and from a limited corner,</t3223>
<t3224>Green grows among black friends as well as white friends.</t3224>
<t3225>So perhaps grass is a metaphor for equality and the close connection between us, as Ms. Holden mentioned.</t3225> <t3226>And Whitman's final words about grass:</t3226>
<t3227>And now to me, the grass is the hair of the grave, hanging loose without the sorrow of cutting.</t3227>
<t3228>Thus, grass is also death–growing from the buried bodies.</t3228> <t3229>There are too many layers of meaning in the image of grass; it truly is a tangled mess.</t3229> <t3230>In summary, grass is a metaphor for life, death, equality, connection, and it alludes to children, God, and hope.</t3230>
<t3231>I have yet to figure out what, if anything, in these images is the essence of this poem.</t3231> <t3232>But thinking about grass and the different ways of perceiving it makes me think of all the ways I have seen and mis-seen Margo.</t3232> <t3233>There is no shortage of ways to look at her.</t3233> <t3234>I was too focused on what she became, but now, as I try to understand the multifaceted nature of grass, with Margo's scent still lingering in my throat from the blanket, I realize that the most important question is: who am I trying to find.</t3234> <t3235>If "What is grass?" requires such a complex answer, then the same must be true for the question "Who is Margo Roth Spiegelman?" Like a metaphor that cannot be instantly conveyed in its entirety by its simultaneous layers of meaning, in what Margo left for me, there is enough room for endless imaginations, for an unlimited series of different Margos.</t3235>
<t3236>I have to narrow her down, and I realize that in this place, there must be things I have seen incorrectly or not seen at all.</t3236> <t3237>I want to tear open the roof above, illuminating every corner to see everything at once, rather than just following the scattered flashlight beams sweeping back and forth.</t3237> <t3238>I set Margo's blanket aside and shouted, loud enough for all the gnawing creatures to hear, "I Will Find Something In This Place!"</t3238>
<t3239>I checked each desk in the office, and the more I searched, the clearer it became that Margo only used the desk with the nail polish bottle in the drawer and the calendar stopped at June.</t3239>
<t3240>I crawled through the Devil's Hole, returned to the library, and once again walked along the empty iron shelves.</t3240> <t3241>On each shelf, I strained my eyes to see if there was any spot not covered in dust, indicating that Margo had used it for something, but I saw nothing.</t3241> <t3242>Then my flashlight happened to sweep over something on top of a shelf in the corner of the room, right near the front window blocked by plywood.</t3242> <t3243>It was the spine of a book.</t3243>
<t3244>The book is titled Following America: A Travel Guide, published in 1998, after this place was abandoned.</t3244> <t3245>I wedged the flashlight between my neck and shoulder, flipping through the pages with my hands.</t3245> <t3246>The book lists hundreds of attractions to visit, from the world's largest ball of twine in Darwin, Minnesota, to the world's largest ball of stamps in Omaha, Nebraska.</t3246> <t3247>Someone had dog-eared a few pages seemingly at random.</t3247> <t3248>The book wasn't very dusty.</t3248> <t3249>Maybe SeaWorld was just the first stop in the whirlwind of adventures. Indeed.</t3249> <t3250>That makes a lot of sense. That's so Margo.</t3250> <t3251>Somehow she had discovered this place, came here to pack her bags, stayed a night or two, and then hit the road.</t3251> <t3252>I can picture her bouncing from one tourist trap to another.</t3252>
<t3253>As the last beam of light gradually faded through the hole in the ceiling, I found a few more books on the other shelves.</t3253> <t3254>A brief journey to Nepal; Majestic Canada; Roaming by car across America; Fodor's guide to the Bahamas; Onward to Bhutan.</t3254> <t3255>There seemed to be no connection between the books, except that they were all travel guides and were published after this mini-mall was abandoned.</t3255> <t3256>I tucked the flashlight under my chin, stacked all the books into a pile from waist-high to chest-high, and carried them to the empty room that I now imagined as the bedroom.</t3256>
<t3257>It turns out I spent the prom night with Margo, just not quite like in my dreams.</t3257> <t3258>Instead of tearing up the dance floor together, I sat leaning against her rolled-up carpet, covering my knees with her old blanket, reading travel guides by flashlight, and sitting quietly in the dark as the cicadas harmonized melodiously above and around me.</t3258>
<t3259>Perhaps Margo had sat here, in this screaming darkness, feeling some kind of despair rising endlessly.</t3259> <t3260>And perhaps she realized that it was impossible not to rewind her thoughts about death.</t3260> <t3261>I imagine so, of course.</t3261>
<t3262>But I also imagine this: Margo collected these books from various clearance sales, buying any travel guide she could find for under twenty-five cents.</t3262> <t3263>Then Margo came here—even before she disappeared—reading books and staying away from prying eyes.</t3263> <t3264>Read them all, trying to map out a journey.</t3264> <t3265>Exactly.</t3265> <t3266>She would wander without leaving a trace, a balloon drifting in the sky, following the eternal wind, leaving behind hundreds of miles each day.</t3266> <t3267>And in this imagination of mine, Margo is full of life.</t3267> <t3268>Did Margo lead me here to give me clues to piece together into a journey?</t3268> <t3269>Maybe.</t3269> <t3270>Of course, so far I haven't even come close to that journey.</t3270> <t3271>Based on the books, Margo could be in Jamaica or Namibia, Topeka or Beijing.</t3271>
<t3272>But I have only just started searching.</t3272>
<t3273>13.</t3273>
<t3274>I dreamed, Margo's head resting on my shoulder while I lay straight, with only the corner of the carpet between us and the concrete floor.</t3274> <t3275>Her arm wrapped around me.</t3275> <t3276>We lay there, sound asleep.</t3276> <t3277>God bless me.</t3277> <t3278>I am the only teenager in America who dreams of sleeping with girls, and just sleeping with them.</t3278> <t3279>Then the phone rang.</t3279> <t3280>It rang two more times before my hand fumbled to find the phone in the fold of the carpet.</t3280> <t3281>It was 3:18 AM.</t3281> <t3282>Ben was calling.</t3282>
<t3283>“Hello Ben,” I said.</t3283>
<t3284>“YEAHHH!!!!</t3284><t3285>!” Ben screamed in response, and I knew right away that now was not the time to try to explain to him all that I had just learned and imagined about Margo.</t3285> <t3286>I almost smelled the alcohol on his breath.</t3286> <t3287>Just the one word “yeah,” uttered in that manner, contained more emotion than anything Ben had ever said to me in his entire life.</t3287>
<t3288>“I understand that the party was very fun, right?”</t3288>
<t3289>“YEAH! Quentin Jacobsen! Mr. Q! The greatest Quentin in America! That's right!” His voice seemed to move away from the phone but I could still hear it clearly.</t3289> <t3290>“Everyone, hey, quiet, quiet, quiet–QUENTIN! JACOBSEN! IS TALKING TO ME!” A burst of cheers erupted, followed by Ben's voice again.</t3290>
<t3291>"Yes, Quentin! Yes! Comrade, you must come here."</t3291>
<t3292>"Where is this?" I asked.</t3292>
<t3293>"Becca's house!</t3293> <t3294>Do you know where it is?"</t3294>
<t3295>That was a close call, I know exactly where that place is.</t3295> <t3296>I went into Becca's basement.</t3296> <t3297>"I know, but it's midnight."</t3297>
<t3298>And I am–”</t3298>
<t3299>"Yes!!!</t3299> <t3300>You have to come right away!</t3300> <t3301>Right now and immediately!"</t3301>
<t3302>"Ben, there are more important things," I replied.</t3302>
<t3303>"DRIVER APPOINTED!"</t3303>
<t3304>“Huh?”</t3304>
<t3305>“I appoint you as my driver! Yes! You deserve to be appointed!</t3305> <t3306>Your phone answering skills are excellent!</t3306> <t3307>Absolutely amazing!</t3307> <t3308>I must be home before six o'clock! And I appoint you to take me home! YAAAAAAA!”</t3308>
<t3309>“Can't you stay the whole night?” I asked.</t3309>
<t3310>“NOOOO! Boo hoo hoo.</t3310> <t3311>Boo hoo hoo Quentin. Hey, everyone! Boo hoo hoo Quentin!” And the whole group booed me. “Everyone is drunk.</t3311> <t3312>Ben is drunk.</t3312> <t3313>Lacey is drunk.</t3313> <t3314>Radar is drunk.</t3314> <t3315>No one can drive.</t3315> <t3316>Be home before six o'clock. Promised mom already.</t3316> <t3317>Boo hoo, sleepyhead Quentin! Well, the designated driver! Yeah!”</t3317>
<t3318>I took a deep breath.</t3318> <t3319>If Margo came back to this place, she must have arrived before three in the morning.</t3319> <t3320>"I'll be there in half an hour."</t3320>
<t3321>“THAT'S IT! YES! YES! YES! YES! YES! YES! YES! YES! YES! YES! YESS!!</t3321><t3322>!!</t3322> <t3323>YES! YES!”</t3323>
<t3324>Ben was still frantically affirming when I hung up the phone.</t3324> <t3325>I lay there for a while longer, telling myself I had to get up, and then I sat up.</t3325> <t3326>Still groggy, I crawled through the Devil's Hole, passed the library into the office, then pulled open the back door and went out to the car.</t3326>
<t3327>At the crack of four in the morning, I turned into Becca Arrington's neighborhood.</t3327> <t3328>There were dozens of cars parked along both sidewalks of Becca's street.</t3328> <t3329>I knew it was even more crowded inside because many kids had been brought by limousines.</t3329> <t3330>I found a parking spot a few cars away from RHAPAW.</t3330>
<t3331>I have never seen Ben drunk.</t3331> <t3332>Back in tenth grade, I once drank a bottle of pink “wine” at a band party.</t3332> <t3333>The taste was so awful that swallowing it or spitting it out made little difference.</t3333> <t3334>It was Ben who sat with me in Cassie Hiney's Pooh-bear-themed bathroom while I vomited that pink liquid all over the picture of Eeyore the donkey.</t3334> <t3335>Perhaps that experience blocked the path of alcohol for both of us.</t3335> <t3336>Until tonight, anyway.</t3336>
<t3337>This time I knew Ben was completely drunk.</t3337> <t3338>Just hearing his voice on the phone was enough to tell.</t3338> <t3339>No one sober would spew out a string of "uh-huhs" and "yeahs" so densely in a minute like that.</t3339> <t3340>However, when I squeezed past a few people smoking on the lawn in front of Becca's house and opened the door, I didn't expect to see Jase Worthington and two other guys from the baseball team holding Ben, dressed in a tuxedo, upside down over a beer keg.</t3340> <t3341>The keg's tap was in Ben's mouth, and the whole room was focused on him.</t3341> <t3342>Everyone was counting in unison, "Eighteen, nineteen, twenty."</t3342> <t3343>At first, I thought Ben was being bullied or pranked.</t3343> <t3344>But no, he was eagerly chugging the beer as if it were mother's milk, with beer streams spilling from the corners of his mouth because he was laughing.</t3344> <t3345>"Twenty-three, twenty-four, twenty-five," everyone continued to chant, and you could hear the wild excitement in their voices.</t3345> <t3346>Clearly, a major event was taking place.</t3346>
<t3347>But it was all so childish, so shameful.</t3347> <t3348>They were all just paper kids amusing themselves with paper fun.</t3348> <t3349>I weaved through the crowd towards Ben, surprised to run into Radar and Angela along the way.</t3349>
<t3350>“What the hell is going on?” I asked.</t3350>
<t3351>Radar stopped counting and turned to me. "Yes!" It also got excited.</t3351> <t3352>"The driver has been appointed already! Yes!"</t3352>
<t3353>“Why is everyone saying 'yes' and 'right' tonight?”</t3353>
<t3354>“Good question,” Angela shouted in response to me.</t3354> <t3355>She puffed her cheeks and sighed, looking just as upset as I was.</t3355>
<t3356>"Damn, yeah, good question!" Radar said, holding a sloshing red plastic cup of beer in each hand.</t3356>
<t3357>“It's all his,” Angela calmly explained to me.</t3357>
<t3358>“Why aren't you the appointed driver?” I asked. “Because everyone wants you,” Angela replied. “They thought that would be the only way to get you here.” I rolled my eyes.</t3358> <t3359>Angela also rolled her eyes sympathetically.</t3359>
<t3360>"Do you like him a lot?" I asked, nodding towards Radar, who was now holding two cups of beer high above his head and joining in the synchronized counting.</t3360> <t3361>Everyone seemed proud that they could still count at this hour.</t3361>
<t3362>“Even now, she's adorable,” Angela replied.</t3362>
<t3363>"I give up on you!" I said.</t3363>
<t3364>Radar nudged me with one of his beer mugs. "Look at our little Ben! When it comes to beer pong, he turns into a genius."</t3364> <t3365>"He's about to set a world record."</t3365>
<t3366>“What does 'beer bomb champion' mean?” I asked.</t3366>
<t3367>Angela pointed towards Ben and said, "There."</t3367>
<t3368>"Well," I said, "Wow, being upside down like that must be really uncomfortable, right?"</t3368>
<t3369>“Well, currently the record for the beer chugging champion in the history of Winter Park school is sixty-two seconds,” Angela explained.</t3369> <t3370>“The record holder is Tony Yorrick,” a giant guy who had graduated when I was just starting ninth grade, now playing for the University of Florida's football team.</t3370>
<t3371>I fully support Ben's record-setting performance, but I can't bring myself to join in the shouting count of everyone, “Fifty-eight, fifty-nine, sixty, sixty-one, sixty-two, sixty-three!” And then Ben released the beer tap and shouted: “YEAH! I AM THE CHAMPION! I SHAKE THE WORLD!” Jase and a few other guys from the baseball team got Ben back to normal and then carried him on their shoulders.</t3371> <t3372>At that moment, Ben caught sight of me, raised his hand to point at me, and let out the most resounding, enthusiastic “YEAH!!!</t3372><t3373>!” I had ever heard.</t3373> <t3374>Even the football players when winning the world championship didn't reach that level of excitement.</t3374>
<t3375>Ben jumped off the shoulders of some baseball guys, landed in a rather comical position, and then staggered to his feet.</t3375> <t3376>He put his arm around me, still chattering away, "RIGHT! Quentin is here! The Great Man is here!</t3376> <t3377>Listen up, because Quentin, the best comrade of the world beer pong champions, is here!” Jase tousled my hair and said, “That’s manly of you, Q!” and then Radar whispered in my ear, “Just so you know, we’re all heroes in everyone’s eyes.</t3377> <t3378>Angela and I put our post-party plans on hold to come here because Ben said I’d be treated like a king.</t3378> <t3379>The whole group was chanting my name.</t3379> <t3380>Clearly, everyone likes Ben a lot, so they like us too.”</t3380>
<t3381>To Radar, and also to everyone else, I exclaimed, "Oh great</t3381><t3382>!"</t3382>
<t3383>Ben swayed his hips as he walked away, and I saw him sticking close to Cassie Hiney, his hand on her shoulder, her hand on his shoulder, and he confessed, "The girl who came with me today almost became the prom queen," and Cassie replied, "I know. </t3383> <t3384>That's awesome!" Ben chattered on, "For the past three years, not a day has gone by that I haven't wished to kiss you!" Cassie responded, "You should do it," and Ben exclaimed, "YES! That's amazing!" But he didn't kiss Cassie.</t3384> <t3385>Ben turned back to me and declared, "Cassie wants to kiss me, man!" I responded, "Good!" and Ben added, "That's amazing!" But then it seemed like he forgot both Cassie and me, as if the idea of kissing Cassie Hiney was better than the actual kiss.</t3385>
<t3386>Cassie said to me, "The party is so fun, isn't it?" so I replied, "Yeah."</t3386>
<t3387>“Quite the opposite of the band's party, huh,” Cassie said. “Yeah,” I replied.</t3387> <t3388>“Ben is so clueless, but I like him,” Cassie said. “Yeah,” I replied.</t3388> <t3389>“Plus, his eyes are so blue,” Cassie added.</t3389> <t3390>“Uh-huh, yeah,” I replied.</t3390> <t3391>“Everyone says you're cuter, but I like Ben,” Cassie continued.</t3391> <t3392>“That's fine,” I replied.</t3392> <t3393>“The party is fun, isn't it?” Cassie asked again, and I replied, “Yeah.” Talking to a drunk person is exactly like babbling with a three-year-old child who has severe brain issues and is in a state of high excitement.</t3393>
<t3394>As soon as Cassie left, Chuck Parson approached me.</t3394>
<t3395>“Jacobsen,” it said, reeking of insider arrogance.</t3395>
<t3396>"Hello Parson," I replied.</t3396>
<t3397>"Did you shave my eyebrows?"</t3397>
<t3398>"Actually, I didn't shave," I explained.</t3398> <t3399>"I just used hair removal cream.</t3399><t3400>"</t3400>
<t3401>It grabbed me hard right in the chest.</t3401> <t3402>"You're a professional scammer," it said and then laughed out loud. "You need to be careful, kid.</t3402> <t3403>Now you're even putting on this puppet show.</t3403>
<t3404>I might really be drunk, but I'm kind of fond of your smooth butt.</t3404>
<t3405>“Thank you,” I said, feeling indifferent to all this mess, these flashy almost-graduation-let's-bare-our-souls-and-proclaim-our-love-for-everyone moments.</t3405> <t3406>And I imagined Margo here, or at thousands of parties like this.</t3406> <t3407>Life fading from her eyes.</t3407> <t3408>I imagined her listening to Chuck Parson's awkward attempts at conversation and her trying to escape, by any means necessary, whether through life or death.</t3408> <t3409>I could envision both paths with equal clarity.</t3409>
<t3410>"Got beer?" Chuck asked.</t3410> <t3411>Maybe I had forgotten it was still there, but with the smell of alcohol coming from his breath, it was hard to pretend not to notice.</t3411> <t3412>I just shook my head, and he turned away.</t3412>
<t3413>I want to go home, but I also know that I can't rush Ben.</t3413> <t3414>This is probably the only glorious night in Ben's life. He deserves to enjoy it.</t3414>
<t3415>While waiting, I followed the stairs down to the basement.</t3415> <t3416>I had been in the dark for a long time but still felt a craving, wanting to lie down somewhere half quiet, half dark, and return to my imaginations about Margo. But as I passed by Becca's room, I heard murmuring sounds—particularly sounding like moaning—so I stopped in front of the slightly ajar door.</t3416>
<t3417>I saw the upper two-thirds of Jase, shirtless, on top of Becca, with her legs wrapped around him.</t3417> <t3418>Neither of them were naked, but they were heading in that direction.</t3418> <t3419>Perhaps a more decent person would have looked away, but people like me don't get many chances to see girls like Becca Arrington naked, so I stood right at the doorway, staring inside.</t3419> <t3420>Then they rolled over, Becca on top of Jase, sighing sensually with the kiss, starting to unbutton his shirt.</t3420> <t3421>"Do you think I'm hot?" Becca purred.</t3421>
<t3422>"Oh my God, yes, very hot Margo," Jase replied.</t3422>
<t3423>“What?!” Becca screamed in fury, and it immediately became clear that I would not get to see Becca naked.</t3423> <t3424>She started yelling, I backed away from the door, Jase caught sight of me and also roared, “What are you doing here?” Becca shrieked, “Forget about him, who cares about him?</t3424> <t3425>What about me?</t3425> <t3426>Why do you think about her and not about me?”</t3426>
<t3427>Perhaps it was the perfect time for me to quietly withdraw from the scene, so I closed the door and went into the bathroom.</t3427> <t3428>I didn't need to use the toilet; mostly, I just wanted to avoid the noise of people.</t3428>
<t3429>It always takes me a few seconds to start peeing after all the equipment is in place, so I just stand still for a moment, wait, and then I begin to pee.</t3429> <t3430>I was in the climax of my relief when a girl's voice echoed from the bathtub, "Who's there?"</t3430>
<t3431>I immediately replied, "It's me, Lacey</t3431><t3432>?"</t3432>
<t3433>“Quentin? What the hell are you doing here?” I wanted to stop peeing but couldn't, of course.</t3433> <t3434>Peeing is an interesting book; once you start, it's extremely, extremely hard to stop.</t3434>
<t3435>“Uh, I went to pee,” I replied.</t3435>
<t3436>"Are you okay?" Lacey asked from behind the curtain around the bathtub.</t3436>
<t3437>"Um, are you okay?" I finished the last part, zipped up my pants, and flushed the toilet.</t3437>
<t3438>“Do you want to chat in the bathtub?” Lacey asked. “I’m not flirting or anything.”</t3438>
<t3439>After considering for a moment, I replied, "Alright." I pulled the curtain aside.</t3439> <t3440>Lacey smiled, sitting with her knees pulled up to her chest.</t3440> <t3441>I sat down opposite her, my back against the cold porcelain tub.</t3441> <t3442>Our feet intertwined.</t3442> <t3443>Lacey was wearing shorts and a short-sleeved t-shirt, with cute flip-flops on her feet.</t3443> <t3444>Her makeup was slightly smudged around her eyes.</t3444> <t3445>Lacey's hair was still styled in an updo from the party, and her legs were tanned.</t3445> <t3446>I had to admit that Lacey Pemberton was very pretty.</t3446> <t3447>Not the kind of girl who could make you forget Margo Roth Spiegelman, but the kind who could make you forget a lot of other things.</t3447>
<t3448>“How was the banquet?” I asked.</t3448>
<t3449>“Ben is very sweet,” Lacey replied. “I’m very happy.</t3449> <t3450>But then Becca and I had a big argument.</t3450> <t3451>Becca called me a flirt, then stood up on the sofa upstairs, shushed everyone to be quiet, and announced to everyone that I had a sexually transmitted disease.”</t3451>
<t3452>I grimaced and exclaimed, "Oh my God!"</t3452>
<t3453>“That's right.</t3453> <t3454>I'm so devastated.</t3454> <t3455>It's just... oh my god.</t3455> <t3456>Honestly, it's really disgusting, because... it's insulting, Becca knows that, yet...</t3456> <t3457>So I came in here, Ben followed, I told him to leave me alone.</t3457> <t3458>I don't blame Ben, but he's not exactly a good listener.</t3458> <t3459>And he was drunk too.</t3459> <t3460>I've been there.</t3460> <t3461>But I've been treated and cured.</t3461> <t3462>Anyway. But I'm not a flirt.</t3462> <t3463>There was only one guy.</t3463> <t3464>That pathetic jerk.</t3464> <t3465>Oh my god, I can't believe I confided in Becca.</t3465> <t3466>I should have only talked to Margo when Becca wasn't around.”</t3466>
<t3467>“I'm very sorry that it happened like that,” I said.</t3467> <t3468>“The problem is that Becca is just jealous.”</t3468>
<t3469>“Why would Becca be jealous? She's the queen of the party.</t3469> <t3470>She's dating Jase.</t3470> <t3471>She's the new Margo.</t3471><t3472>”</t3472>
<t3473>My butt was numb from pressing against the porcelain, so I tried to shift my position.</t3473> <t3474>My knee touched Lacey's knee.</t3474> <t3475>“No one can ever be the new Margo,” I said.</t3475> <t3476>“You have something that Becca really wants.</t3476> <t3477>People like you. People find you more likable.”</t3477>
<t3478>Lacey shyly shrugged, "Do you think I'm frivolous and shallow?"</t3478>
<t3479>“Uh, kind of.”</t3479> <t3480>I thought back to the scene where I was standing outside Becca's bedroom, eagerly hoping she would be naked.</t3480> <t3481>“But I'm the same way,” I added.</t3481> <t3482>“Who isn't.” I often thought, If only I had a body like Jase Worthington.</t3482> <t3483>Walking confidently as if I knew how to walk.</t3483> <t3484>Kissing skillfully as if I knew how to kiss.</t3484>
<t3485>“But in different ways.</t3485> <t3486>Ben and I are both frivolous and shallow in the same way.</t3486> <t3487>You, on the other hand, don't care whether people like you or not.”</t3487>
<t3488>That is both true and not true.</t3488> <t3489>"I care more than I want to," I said.</t3489>
<t3490>"Without Margo, everything is just chaotic," Lacey said.</t3490> <t3491>She was also drunk, but I didn't mind this kind of drunkenness.</t3491>
<t3492>"Yes," I agreed.</t3492>
<t3493>“I want you to take me there,” Lacey continued.</t3493> <t3494>“Those empty stores.</t3494> <t3495>Ben already told me about them.”</t3495>
<t3496>“Sure, we can go whenever you want,” I replied, then told Lacey that I had been there all night, that I had found Margo's nail polish and blanket.</t3496>
<t3497>Lacey was silent for a moment, mouth open, breathing. Finally, when she spoke, it was almost a whisper.</t3497> <t3498>Finding the words for a question and stating it as a fact, “Margo is dead, isn't she.”</t3498>
<t3499>"Lacey, I don't know.</t3499> <t3500>Until tonight, I thought so too, but now I don't know anymore."</t3500>
<t3501>"He is dead, and yet we... are playing these games."</t3501>
<t3502>I suddenly thought of a marked line in Whitman: “If no one else in the world realizes, I sit peacefully, / And if everyone realizes, I sit peacefully.”</t3502> <t3503>I said to Lacey, “Maybe that's what Margo wants, for life to just go on.”</t3503>
<t3504>“That doesn't seem like Margo at all,” Lacey said, and I thought about my Margo, Lacey's Margo, Ms. Spiegelman's Margo, all of us seeing reflections of Margo in different mirrors in the funhouse.</t3504> <t3505>I was about to say something, but Lacey had actually fallen asleep, mouth agape, head resting against the cold, tiled bathroom wall.</t3505>
<t3506>After two more people entered the bathroom to urinate, I decided to wake Lacey.</t3506> <t3507>At nearly 5 AM, I needed to take Ben home.</t3507>
<t3508>"Lacey, wake up," I called, gently nudging his slippers with my shoe.</t3508>
<t3509>Lacey shook her head.</t3509> <t3510>"I like being woken up like this," she said.</t3510> <t3511>"You know, right now you feel like my best friend."</t3511>
<t3512>“It's a pleasure,” I said, Lacey still tipsy, tired, and not willing to get up. “So listen to me, we'll go upstairs together, and if anyone dares to touch you, I'll defend your honor.”</t3512>
<t3513>“Agreed,” Lacey said.</t3513> <t3514>We went upstairs together; the party had thinned out, but there were still a few guys from the baseball team, including Jase, sitting around a beer keg.</t3514> <t3515>Most people were sleeping in sleeping bags scattered across the floor; a few were curled up to fit on the sofas.</t3515> <t3516>Angela and Radar were lying next to each other on a loveseat, with Radar's legs stretched out to one side.</t3516> <t3517>Both were fast asleep.</t3517>
<t3518>I was about to ask the guys gathered around the beer keg if they had seen Ben, when Ben came charging into the living room.</t3518> <t3519>He was wearing a sky-blue child's beret on his head, holding a sword made from eight empty cans of Milwaukee’s Best Light.</t3519> <t3520>It looked like Ben had glued them all together.</t3520>
<t3521>"I SEE YOU NOW!" Ben shouted, pointing his sword at me.</t3521>
<t3522>“I DISCOVERED QUENTIN JACOBSEN! YESSS! Come here! Kneel down!”</t3522>
<t3523>“What now?</t3523> <t3524>Calm down, Ben.”</t3524>
<t3525>"GET DOWN!"</t3525>
<t3526>I obediently knelt down, looking up at it.</t3526>
<t3527>Ben lowered the beer can sword, touching each of my shoulders. "With the power of the super-glued beer can sword, I dub thee driver!"</t3527>
<t3528>“Thanks,” I mumbled.</t3528> <t3529>“Don't throw up in the car.”</t3529>
<t3530>“Yes!” he shouted.</t3530> <t3531>I was about to stand up when Ben pushed me back down to kneel with his non-sword-beer-can hand.</t3531> <t3532>He touched the sword to both of my shoulders again and solemnly said, “With the power of the super-glued beer can sword, I declare that you will be naked under your robe at the graduation ceremony.”</t3532>
<t3533>“Huh?” I stood up abruptly.</t3533>
<t3534>"Yes! Me, you, and Radar! Naked under the robe!"</t3534>
<t3535>At the graduation ceremony!</t3535> <t3536>It will be earth-shattering, just wait and see!”</t3536>
<t3537>"Let's see," I said, "it will be very hot."</t3537>
<t3538>"Okay!" Ben groaned. "Swear that you will keep your word! Radar has already sworn! RADAR, YOU HAVE SWORN, HAVEN'T YOU?"</t3538>
<t3539>Radar slightly tilted his head, squinting and mumbling.</t3539> <t3540>"I swore."</t3540>
<t3541>“Alright, that works, I swear too,” I said.</t3541>
<t3542>"THAT'S THE WAY!" Then Ben turned to Lacey.</t3542> <t3543>"I love you."</t3543>
<t3544>“I love you too, Ben.</t3544><t3545>”</t3545>
<t3546>“No, I love you.</t3546> <t3547>Not like a brother loves a sister, or friends love friends.</t3547> <t3548>I love you like a drunk loves the most adorable girl in the world.”</t3548> <t3549>Lacey smiled.</t3549>
<t3550>I stepped forward, trying to rescue him from further embarrassing himself, placed my hand on his shoulder, and said, "If you want to get home before six, we have to go."</t3550>
<t3551>“It’s alright,” Ben said.</t3551> <t3552>“I’m just going to thank Becca for throwing such a great party.</t3552><t3553>”</t3553>
<t3554>Lacey and I followed Ben downstairs, Ben opened Becca's room door and said, "Your party is really funny!</t3554> <t3555>But you're so gross!</t3555> <t3556>It's like your heart pumps not blood but that gross-fluid.</t3556> <t3557>But thanks for the beer!" Becca was alone, lying on the bed, staring at the ceiling.</t3557> <t3558>Without bothering to look at Ben, Becca muttered, "Go to hell, you dumb face, I hope the crabs crawl from her to you."</t3558>
<t3559>Without a hint of malicious sarcasm, Ben replied, "Very nice talking to you!" and closed the door.</t3559> <t3560>I think Ben had no idea that Becca's words were actually very offensive.</t3560>
<t3561>We went upstairs and were almost at the door.</t3561> <t3562>"Ben," I said, "leave the beer can sword behind."</t3562>
<t3563>"Oh right," Ben said.</t3563> <t3564>I grabbed one end of the sword and pulled, but Ben wouldn't let go. I was about to get mad at this drunken monkey when I realized he couldn't release the sword.</t3564>
<t3565>Lacey burst out laughing, "Ben, did you just stick yourself with the sword</t3565><t3566>?"</t3566>
<t3567>“No,” Ben replied. “I’m super attached.</t3567> <t3568>That way it won’t get stolen!”</t3568>
<t3569>“Sharp thinking,” Lacey tried to appear serious.</t3569>
<t3570>Lacey and I managed to remove the beer cans, except for the last one which was stuck directly to Ben's hand. No matter how hard I pulled, Ben's hand would go limp and follow, as if the beer can was the string and Ben's hand was the puppet.</t3570> <t3571>Finally, Lacey said, "We have to go." So we got in the car, shoving Ben into the back seat of the minivan.</t3571> <t3572>Lacey sat next to him, because "I should keep an eye on him so he doesn't throw up or beat himself to death with this beer can hand."</t3572>
<t3573>But Ben was sleeping soundly, so Lacey could comfortably talk about it.</t3573> <t3574>As I was driving on the interstate, Lacey said, "You know, if you've made an effort, it needs to be recognized.</t3574> <t3575>I mean, Ben has tried his best, but why did things turn out so badly?</t3575> <t3576>He's sweet, isn't he?"</t3576>
<t3577>“I think so too,” I replied.</t3577> <t3578>Ben's head wobbled all over the place, looking as if it had detached from his spine.</t3578> <t3579>To me, Ben wasn't particularly sweet, but it didn't matter.</t3579>
<t3580>I dropped Lacey off first, on the other side of Jefferson Park. When Lacey bent down to give Ben a light kiss on the lips, it made a smacking sound that was enough to form a "Mm-hmm."</t3580><t3581>"</t3581>
<t3582>Lacey walked towards the car gate to go up to her apartment.</t3582> <t3583>"Thank you," Lacey said.</t3583> <t3584>I just nodded.</t3584>
<t3585>I drove through this neighborhood.</t3585> <t3586>The sky was no longer dark but not yet light.</t3586> <t3587>Ben snored peacefully on the back seat.</t3587> <t3588>I stopped in front of his house, got out to open the car door, and unbuckled Ben's seatbelt.</t3588>
<t3589>"We're home, Ben."</t3589><t3590></t3590>
<t3591>It sniffled and shook its head, then woke up.</t3591> <t3592>It intended to rub its eyes and seemed surprised to see an empty Milwaukee’s Best Light can stuck to its right hand.</t3592> <t3593>It tried to crush the can by squeezing it but to no avail.</t3593> <t3594>Ben looked at the beer can for about a minute, then nodded and exclaimed, "The monster keeps clinging to me!"</t3594>
<t3595>He got out of the car, staggered onto the sidewalk to enter the house.</t3595> <t3596>When he was standing under the front porch, Ben turned around and smiled.</t3596>
<t3597>I waved at it.</t3597> <t3598>The beer can waved back.</t3598>
<t3599>14.</t3599>
<t3600>I slept for a few hours, then spent the entire morning reading through the travel books I had just opened the day before.</t3600> <t3601>I waited until noon to call Ben and Radar.</t3601> <t3602>I called Ben first, "Good morning, the sun is already high in the sky."</t3602>
<t3603>“Oh, God,” Ben replied, his voice dripping with what sounded like utter despair.</t3603> <t3604>“Oh, sweet little God, please come here and soothe this brother Ben.</t3604> <t3605>Oh, please pour down upon me Your salvation.”</t3605>
<t3606>“There has been a lot of progress regarding Margo,” I said excitedly, “Get your butt over here.</t3606> <t3607>I will call Radar too.”</t3607>
<t3608>It seems like Ben didn't pay attention to what I just said.</t3608> <t3609>"Hey, my mom came into my room at nine o'clock this morning, and as I was sitting up yawning, my mom and I both discovered a beer can stuck to my hand. What's up with that?"</t3609>
<t3610>"He super-glued a bunch of cans together into a beer can sword, then he super-glued his hand to it."</t3610>
<t3611>"Uh uh. Sword of the beer can.</t3611> <t3612>Sounds familiar.</t3612><t3613>"</t3613>
<t3614>"Ben, come to my house."</t3614>
<t3615>"I feel very confused, sir."</t3615>
<t3616>“Then let me come over to your house.</t3616> <t3617>When will you be ready?”</t3617>
<t3618>"Buddy, don't come over.</t3618> <t3619>I need to sleep for another ten thousand hours.</t3619> <t3620>I also need to drink ten thousand gallons of water, and take a dose of ten thousand Advil painkillers.</t3620> <t3621>See you at school tomorrow."</t3621>
<t3622>I took a deep breath to keep from getting angry.</t3622> <t3623>“I drove across Central Florida at midnight to play the role of the only sober person at the world's drunkest party, to take your leaking ass home, and here–” I hadn't even finished speaking when I realized Ben had already hung up.</t3623> <t3624>He dared to hang up on me.</t3624> <t3625>That bastard.</t3625>
<t3626>The more time passed, the more irritable I became.</t3626> <t3627>Not caring about Margo was one thing.</t3627> <t3628>But now, Ben didn't pay any attention to me either.</t3628> <t3629>Perhaps our friendship had always been just a convenience for him—he couldn't find anyone cooler than me to play video games with.</t3629> <t3630>Now he didn't need to be nice to me anymore, or care about the things I cared about, because he had Jase Worthington. Ben had become the beer pong champion at school.</t3630> <t3631>He had invited a hot girl to the prom.</t3631> <t3632>He had seized his first chance to join the ranks of the truly obnoxious guys.</t3632>
<t3633>Five minutes after Ben hung up, I called back on his mobile phone.</t3633> <t3634>Ben didn't answer, so I left a message, "You want to be a big shot like Chuck, don't you, Ben the Jerk? You still crave that, huh? Oh, congratulations!</t3634> <t3635>You did it.</t3635> <t3636>You and he are a perfect match, because you're also a stinking pile.</t3636> <t3637>Don't call back."</t3637>
<t3638>Then I called Radar.</t3638> <t3639>"Hello," I said.</t3639>
<t3640>"Hi," it replied.</t3640> <t3641>"I just threw up while I was showering.</t3641> <t3642>Can I call you back later?"</t3642>
<t3643>"Alright," I replied, trying not to sound irritated.</t3643> <t3644>I just wanted someone to help me rearrange this world according to Margo's perspective.</t3644> <t3645>But Radar wasn't like Ben; a few minutes later, he called back immediately.</t3645>
<t3646>"It was so disgusting that I vomited while cleaning, and when cleaning that mess, I vomited again.</t3646> <t3647>It was like a perpetual motion machine.</t3647> <t3648>Just feed me and I can keep vomiting endlessly.</t3648><t3649>"</t3649>
<t3650>"Can you come over here?</t3650> <t3651>Or should I come to your house?"</t3651>
<t3652>"Huh, sure."</t3652> <t3653>"What's going on?"</t3653>
<t3654>“Margo was in the mini-mall for at least one night after she disappeared.”</t3654>
<t3655>“I will come to your place.</t3655> <t3656>In four minutes.”</t3656>
<t3657>Radar was at my window exactly four minutes later.</t3657> <t3658>"You should know that I'm in a major battle with Ben," I said as Radar climbed into the room.</t3658>
<t3659>“I'm so exhausted that I don't even want to mediate between you two anymore,” Radar quietly replied.</t3659> <t3660>He collapsed onto the bed, eyes half-closed, scratching his messy hair.</t3660> <t3661>“I feel like I've just been struck by lightning,” he sniffled.</t3661> <t3662>“Alright, give me an update.” I sat down on the chair by the study desk and told Radar about how I had spent the entire night in Margo's hideout, trying my best not to leave out any potentially useful details.</t3662> <t3663>I knew Radar was better at solving puzzles than I was, and I hoped that this time he could piece everything together.</t3663>
<t3664>“Then Ben called and I went to the party.</t3664><t3665>”</t3665>
<t3666>Radar waited until I finished speaking before asking, "Do you have that book here?"</t3666> <t3667>"The one with the dog-eared pages?" it asked.</t3667> <t3668>I sat up and rummaged through the pile of blankets, finally finding the book.</t3668> <t3669>Radar held the book high above its head, squinting because it was still groggy, and flipped through the pages.</t3669>
<t3670>“Rewrite it,” she said.</t3670> <t3671>“Omaha, Nebraska. Sac City, Iowa.</t3671> <t3672>Alexandria, Indiana.</t3672> <t3673>Darwin, Minnesota.</t3673> <t3674>Hollywood, California.</t3674> <t3675>Alliance, Nebraska. Done.</t3675> <t3676>Among all the information, those are the places that Margo—or, well, anyone reading this book—would find interesting.” She stood up, pushed me out of the chair, sat down, and turned to the computer.</t3676> <t3677>Radar had the amazing talent of being able to talk and type at the same time.</t3677> <t3678>“There’s a computer program with an integrated map that allows you to input several locations, and it will outline different routes.</t3678> <t3679>Not sure if Margo knew about that program.</t3679> <t3680>But, I want to give it a try.”</t3680>
<t3681>"How do you know everything so thoroughly?" I asked.</t3681>
<t3682>“Um, let me repeat: I. Dedicate. My. Life. To. Omnictionary.</t3682> <t3683>From the moment I got home this morning until I rushed into the bathroom, I completely rewrote the article on the blue-spotted Anglerfish.</t3683> <t3684>I have issues.</t3684> <t3685>Alright, look at this,” Radar called.</t3685> <t3686>I leaned over and saw several winding routes marked on the map of the United States. They all started from Orlando and ended in Hollywood, California.</t3686>
<t3687>“Is Margo in Los Angeles?” Radar hypothesized.</t3687>
<t3688>“Maybe,” I replied.</t3688> <t3689>“But there's no way to know which route Margo took.”</t3689>
<t3690>“Yeah.</t3690> <t3691>There's nothing that specifically points to Los Angeles.</t3691> <t3692>Based on what Margo told Jase, it could be New York. And the message ‘will go to the paper towns and will never come back’ seems to be aimed at the ghost towns around here.</t3692> <t3693>The nail polish bottle might imply that Margo hasn't gone far yet?</t3693> <t3694>We can also add the place with the world's largest popcorn ball to the list of possible places Margo might go.”</t3694>
<t3695>“The travel journey aligns with Whitman's verse: ‘I embark on the perpetual journey.’</t3695><t3696>’”</t3696>
<t3697>Radar was still busy with the computer.</t3697> <t3698>I sat down on the bed.</t3698> <t3699>"Hey, can you print out the map so I can locate the places?" I asked.</t3699>
<t3700>“You can do it on the computer,” Radar said.</t3700>
<t3701>“Yes, but I want to see it more directly.” A few seconds later, the printer whirred, and I hung the map of the United States on the wall, next to the map of ghost towns.</t3701> <t3702>I pinned thumbtacks on each of the six locations that Margo (or someone) had marked in the book.</t3702> <t3703>I tried to observe it as if it were a constellation, to see if they formed any shapes or letters—but I couldn't see anything.</t3703> <t3704>The locations were scattered randomly, as if she had blindfolded herself and thrown darts at the map.</t3704>
<t3705>I sighed.</t3705>
<t3706>“Do you know what to do now?” Radar asked.</t3706> <t3707>“If only there was evidence showing that Margo had opened her email or accessed somewhere on the Internet.</t3707> <t3708>Every day I type her name to search.</t3708> <t3709>I have an automated program that will notify me if Margo logs into Omnictionary using her username.</t3709> <t3710>I track the IP addresses of people searching for the term 'paper towns.'</t3710> <t3711>It's exhausting.”</t3711>
<t3712>"I didn't expect you to go through all that trouble," I said.</t3712>
<t3713>“Well, it's nothing.</t3713> <t3714>I'm just doing what I would want others to do for me.</t3714> <t3715>I know I'm not Margo's friend, but she deserves to be found, you understand what I mean?”</t3715>
<t3716>“Unless Margo doesn't want to be found,” I said.</t3716>
<t3717>"Yes, that's also possible."</t3717> <t3718>"All possibilities are still open."</t3718> <t3719>I nodded.</t3719>
<t3720>"Uh, well–alright." Radar changed the subject. "Shall we continue brainstorming with a video game?"</t3720>
<t3721>“I'm not in the mood.</t3721><t3722>”</t3722>
<t3723>"How about calling Ben?"</t3723>
<t3724>"No.</t3724> <t3725>Ben is a jerk.</t3725><t3726>"</t3726>
<t3727>Radar looked askance at me. "Of course Ben is a jerk.</t3727> <t3728>But do you know what your problem is, Quentin? You keep expecting people not to be themselves.</t3728> <t3729>Think about it, I could be really annoyed with you for being incredibly late, having no interest in any topic except Margo Roth Spiegelman, or, like, never bothering to ask how things are going with my girlfriend.</t3729> <t3730>But I don't mind, buddy, because you are you.</t3730> <t3731>My parents hoard a ton of black Santas for no reason, but it's okay.</t3731> <t3732>Parents are parents.</t3732> <t3733>I'm so obsessed with a website that collects all sorts of information that I don't answer the phone when my friends or girlfriend call.</t3733> <t3734>But that's okay too.</t3734> <t3735>That's me.</t3735> <t3736>You still like me.</t3736> <t3737>I like you too.</t3737> <t3738>You're quirky, kind of weird, you're often late, but in the end, you're always there and that's what matters."</t3738>
<t3739>"Thank you, sir."</t3739>
<t3740>"Okay, then, I'm not flattering you.</t3740> <t3741>But listen: don't think that Ben should be you, and he should also abandon the idea that you should be him, then you two will continue to cause chaos in heaven and hell."</t3741>
<t3742>"It's okay," I finally said, and called Ben. The information that Radar was here and wanted to play video games was a miraculous hangover cure.</t3742>
<t3743>“So,” I said after hanging up the phone, “how is Angela doing?”</t3743>
<t3744>Radar burst out laughing.</t3744> <t3745>"It's all good, brother, all good.</t3745> <t3746>Thank you for asking."</t3746>
<t3747>"Are you still a virgin?" I asked curiously.</t3747>
<t3748>"We don't play the game of gossiping here."</t3748> <t3749>"But, yes, still new."</t3749> <t3750>"Yeah, and this morning the two of us just had a fight."</t3750> <t3751>"We had breakfast at Waffle House, and Angela kept praising how great Black Santas are, saying that my parents are exemplary people for having started that collection, because we need to avoid the stereotype that cool characters like Jesus or Santa are all white, and that Black Santas would strengthen and promote the African American community."</t3751>
<t3752>"Actually, I agree with Angela too," I said.</t3752>
<t3753>“Alright, starting off is a good idea, but the actual execution is clumsy.</t3753> <t3754>My parents are not going to preach the gospel about a black Santa Claus.</t3754> <t3755>If they wanted that, they would have created black Santa Clauses themselves.</t3755> <t3756>Instead, they are just trying to buy from the existing supply.</t3756> <t3757>There is an old man in Pittsburgh who owns the second largest collection, and my parents are always trying to buy his collection.”</t3757>
<t3758>Ben's voice was calling out at the doorway, clearly he had been standing there for a while.</t3758> <t3759>"Radar, your failure to handle the bunny lady is the most severe humanitarian disaster of our time."</t3759>
<t3760>“What are you doing, Ben?” I asked.</t3760>
<t3761>“Thanks, comrade, for giving me a ride home last night.”</t3761>
<t3762>15.</t3762>
<t3763>Even though there was only one week left before the final exam, I still spent the entire Monday afternoon reading "Song of Myself." I wanted to visit the remaining two ghost towns, but Ben needed the car.</t3763> <t3764>I was no longer searching for clues in the poem as if I were searching for Margo herself.</t3764> <t3765>This time, halfway through reading "Song of Myself," I got stuck on a part that I kept coming back to.</t3765>
<t3766>“I think for a long time ahead, I will just listen,” Whitman wrote.</t3766> <t3767>And for the next two pages, he just listened: to the babbling brook, to people's voices, to the opera music.</t3767> <t3768>He sat on the grass and let the sounds wash over him.</t3768> <t3769>Perhaps that is also what I am trying to do: listen to all her most subtle sounds, because before understanding, one must first hear.</t3769> <t3770>It has been too long since I truly heard Margo—I saw her screaming and thought she was laughing—but now I realize that listening is what needs to be done.</t3770> <t3771>Trying, even from this vast distance, to hear Margo's opera.</t3771>
<t3772>If I couldn't hear Margo, at least I could hear what she used to hear.</t3772> <t3773>So I downloaded an album of Woody Guthrie cover songs.</t3773> <t3774>I sat by the computer, closed my eyes, elbows resting on the table, listening to the voice in the minor key.</t3774> <t3775>I tried to hear, in a song I had never heard before, a voice I was beginning to find hard to remember after twelve days.</t3775>
<t3776>I was still listening to music–now it was another one of Margo's favorite singers, Bob Dylan–when I saw Mom come home. "Dad will be home late today," she said through my still-closed door.</t3776> <t3777>"Shall I make turkey sandwiches?"</t3777>
<t3778>“Yes, it's delicious,” I replied, then closed my eyes to listen to music again.</t3778> <t3779>After listening to another one and a half albums, I got up when my father called me for dinner.</t3779>
<t3780>During dinner, my parents talked about the political situation in the Middle East.</t3780> <t3781>Even though they completely agreed with each other, they still loudly criticized, saying this-and-that was deceitful, this-and-that was fraudulent and thieving, and that the whole bunch should just resign already.</t3781> <t3782>I focused on my turkey sandwich, which was absolutely delicious, drenched in ketchup and fragrant grilled onions.</t3782>
<t3783>“Alright, let's stop here,” Mom concluded after a discussion.</t3783>
<t3784>"How was today, Quentin?"</t3784>
<t3785>"I'm fine," I replied. "Ready for the exam, I think."</t3785>
<t3786>“I can't believe you're going to school for the last week,” Dad said.</t3786> <t3787>“It really feels like just yesterday...</t3787><t3788>”</t3788>
<t3789>“That's right,” my mother said wistfully.</t3789> <t3790>A voice in my head was screaming: WARNING NOSTALGIA ALERT WARNING WARNING WARNING. My parents are the best in the world, but they are easily moved and sentimentally cheesy to an extreme.</t3790>
<t3791>“Your father and I are very proud of you,” said Mom.</t3791> <t3792>“But oh my God, we will miss you so much next fall.”</t3792>
<t3793>“Oh, yes, but it's also too early to say.</t3793> <t3794>I might fail the National Language subject.</t3794><t3795>”</t3795>
<t3796>Mom laughed, then said, "Oh, do you know who I met yesterday at the Christian Youth Association? It was Ms. Betty Parson.</t3796> <t3797>She said that this fall Chuck will be going to the University of Georgia.</t3797> <t3798>I'm happy for Chuck, the boy has put in a lot of effort.</t3798><t3799>"</t3799>
<t3800>“It just stinks, Mom,” I said.</t3800>
<t3801>"Sigh," Dad said, "Chuck often bullies his friends.</t3801> <t3802>Such behavior needs to be corrected."</t3802> <t3803>That's exactly how my parents think: in their eyes, no one is just plain bad.</t3803> <t3804>There is always something wrong with everyone, not because they are inherently evil: they have social communication disorders, borderline personality syndrome, something like that.</t3804>
<t3805>Mom continued the story, "But Chuck had difficulties while studying.</t3805> <t3806>The boy faced all sorts of problems—like anyone else.</t3806> <t3807>I know you don't see your friends that way now, but when you grow older, you'll start to see it—the good ones, the bad ones, all your friends—they're all human.</t3807> <t3808>They all deserve to be cared for.</t3808> <t3809>With varying levels of physical, psychological, and self-actualization abilities.</t3809> <t3810>But you know, I always liked Ms. Betty Parson, always had hope for Chuck.</t3810> <t3811>So it's a good thing that the boy is going to college, don't you think?"</t3811>
<t3812>“Mom, actually I don't really care about it, whether it's cut horizontally or vertically, it's the same to me.”</t3812> <t3813>But I do wonder, if everyone is human, why are my parents still upset about the politicians in Israel and Palestine? My parents don't talk about them as if they are human too.</t3813>
<t3814>Dad stopped chewing something, put down the fork, and looked at me.</t3814> <t3815>"The more I work," Dad said, "the more I realize that people lack proper mirrors.</t3815> <t3816>It's really hard for someone to show us how we truly look, and it's really hard for us to tell others how we feel."</t3816>
<t3817>“It sounds so good,” Mom said.</t3817> <t3818>I like how my parents like each other like that.</t3818> <t3819>“But isn't it true that deep down, we find it hard to understand that others are human just as we are human?</t3819> <t3820>We idealize them as gods or categorize them as animals.”</t3820>
<t3821>"That's right.</t3821> <t3822>Perception also creates distorted windows.</t3822> <t3823>Perhaps you haven't thought much in that direction.</t3823><t3824>"</t3824>
<t3825>I sit in the back.</t3825> <t3826>I am listening.</t3826> <t3827>And I hear something about her, the windows and mirrors.</t3827> <t3828>Chuck Parson is a person.</t3828> <t3829>Just like me. Margo Roth Spiegelman is also a person.</t3829> <t3830>And I had never thought of her that way, not really; that was the failure of all my previous imaginings.</t3830> <t3831>For a long time—not just after she left, but for the decade before that—I had imagined Margo without listening, not knowing that the windows she put up were just as flawed as mine.</t3831> <t3832>Thus, I couldn't imagine her as a person who might also feel fear, feel isolated in a crowd, ashamed to keep a record collection because it was too personal to share.</t3832> <t3833>A person who might have read travel books to escape from life in a city where too many people flocked to.</t3833> <t3834>A person—because no one thought of her as a person—had no one to really talk to.</t3834>
<t3835>And immediately I realized how Margo Roth Spiegelman felt when she was not Margo Roth Spiegelman: she was empty.</t3835> <t3836>She felt surrounded by an endless wall.</t3836> <t3837>I thought of her sleeping on the carpet with the torn sky above.</t3837> <t3838>Perhaps Margo felt comfortable there because Margo-the-person always lived like that: in an abandoned room with sealed windows, the only light coming through the holes in the ceiling.</t3838> <t3839>Exactly.</t3839> <t3840>The serious mistake I had always made–to be fair, she had always made me make–was this: Margo was not a miracle.</t3840> <t3841>She was not an adventure.</t3841> <t3842>She was not a precious, beautiful thing.</t3842> <t3843>Margo was a girl.</t3843>
<t3844>16.</t3844>
<t3845>The clock seemed to torture me, but the intuition that I was about to untangle the knot made time seem to completely stand still on Tuesday. We all decided to go to the mini shopping mall right after school, the wait was unbearable.</t3845> <t3846>Finally, the bell signaling the end of Vietnamese class rang, I rushed down the stairs and was about to leave the gate when I remembered that Ben and Radar were still practicing music, so they couldn't leave immediately.</t3846> <t3847>I sat outside the music room, took a small pizza wrapped in a napkin from my backpack, which I had kept since lunch.</t3847> <t3848>I had eaten about a quarter when Lacey Pemberton came and sat next to me.</t3848> <t3849>I offered her some pizza, but Lacey declined.</t3849>
<t3850>We talked about Margo, of course, the common gap between us.</t3850> <t3851>"I need to pinpoint," I said, wiping greasy hands on my jeans, "a location.</t3851> <t3852>But I'm not even sure if reasoning about ghost towns is the right direction.</t3852> <t3853>Sometimes I think we're completely off track."</t3853>
<t3854>“Yeah, I don't know either.</t3854> <t3855>To be honest, putting everything aside, I like finding things related to Margo.</t3855> <t3856>Things I never knew before.</t3856> <t3857>I didn't know who she really was.</t3857> <t3858>Honestly, I never thought of anything other than seeing Margo as a crazy beautiful friend, doing all sorts of crazy beautiful things.</t3858><t3859>”</t3859>
<t3860>“Yeah, but Margo didn't impulsively do everything,” I said.</t3860> <t3861>“All of her adventures had something...</t3861> <t3862>I don't know.”</t3862>
<t3863>“Charming and glamorous,” Lacey said.</t3863> <t3864>“Margo is the only person I know who isn't, uh, an adult yet, but already has that charming glamour.”</t3864>
<t3865>"Yes."</t3865>
<t3866>“So it's hard to imagine him in a dusty, dark, and damp room.”</t3866>
<t3867>"Yes," I said.</t3867> <t3868>"There are also rats."</t3868>
<t3869>Lacey hugged her knees to her chest, sitting like a baby in the womb. "Ugh.</t3869> <t3870>That doesn't seem much like Margo."</t3870>
<t3871>Lacey sat in the front seat next to the driver, as she was the shortest of the group.</t3871> <t3872>Ben was driving.</t3872> <t3873>I sighed deeply while Radar, sitting next to me, had taken out his handheld computer and started working on the Omnictionary.</t3873>
<t3874>“Just deleted the nonsense in the article about Chuck Norris,” it said.</t3874> <t3875>“For example, I totally agree that Chuck Norris's signature move is the roundhouse kick, but I think it's too ridiculous to write something like this, ‘Chuck Norris's tears can cure cancer, but unfortunately, he never cries.’”</t3875> <t3876>The task of deleting-the-nonsense only occupies about four percent of my brain anyway.”</t3876>
<t3877>Even though I understood that Radar was trying to make a joke, I still only wanted to talk about one thing.</t3877> <t3878>"I don't believe that Margo is in some ghost town.</t3878> <t3879>That might not even be the 'paper towns' that Margo was talking about.</t3879> <t3880>There are too many clues about the locations, but nothing concrete.</t3880><t3881>"</t3881>
<t3882>Radar looked up for a second and then turned his eyes back to the screen, "Personally, I think Margo is far away by now, on some kind of thrilling tour and mistakenly believes she has left enough clues.</t3882> <t3883>So I think she is, let's see, in Omaha, Nebraska, visiting the world's largest ball of stamps, or in Minnesota admiring the world's largest ball of twine."</t3883>
<t3884>Glancing through the rearview mirror, Ben spoke up, "So you think Margo is on a cross-country tour admiring all kinds of the World's Largest Round Things, huh?" Radar nodded in agreement.</t3884>
<t3885>"Oh wow," Ben continued, "someone needs to tell Margo that she just needs to come home, because she will be stunned by the biggest pair of balls in the world right here, in the city of Orlando, Florida. That treasure is on display in a special exhibit called 'my place.'</t3885><t3886>"</t3886>
<t3887>Radar laughed loudly, Ben added, "I'm serious."</t3887> <t3888>“My balls are so big that when you order fries at McDonald's, you can choose from four sizes: small, medium, large, and Ben's balls size.”</t3888>
<t3889>Lacey couldn't bear to look at Ben anymore, saying, "None.</t3889> <t3890>Of. Your.</t3890> <t3891>Business."</t3891>
<t3892>“I'm sorry,” Ben whispered. “Margo is probably in Orlando,” he said.</t3892> <t3893>“Watching us look for her.</t3893> <t3894>And watching her parents not look.”</t3894>
<t3895>"I still support the New York hypothesis," Lacey said.</t3895>
<t3896>“Anything is possible,” I said.</t3896> <t3897>Each Margo for each of us–and more mirrors than windows.</t3897>
<t3898>The mini shopping area still looked the same as a few days ago.</t3898> <t3899>Ben parked the car, and I led the group through the push-in door into the office area.</t3899> <t3900>Once everyone was inside, I whispered, "Don't turn on the flashlights yet, let your eyes adjust for a moment." There were a few fingernails digging into my forearm. "It's okay, Lacey," I murmured.</t3900>
<t3901>"Oops," Lacey exclaimed. "Wrong hand." It turned out she was looking for Ben's hand.</t3901>
<t3902>Slowly, the room began to reveal faint, grayish shapes.</t3902> <t3903>I saw rows of tables, still waiting for the staff to arrive.</t3903> <t3904>I turned on my flashlight, and the others turned on theirs as well.</t3904> <t3905>Ben and Lacey went together, crawling through the Hole to explore other rooms.</t3905> <t3906>Radar went with me to Margo's desk. He knelt down to closely examine the calendar that had stopped at June.</t3906>
<t3907>I was bending down towards it when I suddenly heard the sound of footsteps quickly approaching us.</t3907>
<t3908>"Someone's here," Ben whispered urgently.</t3908> <t3909>He immediately crawled under Margo's table, pulling Lacey along.</t3909>
<t3910>“What? Where?”</t3910>
<t3911>“Next room!” it said.</t3911> <t3912>“Wear a mask.</t3912> <t3913>Looks like government people.</t3913> <t3914>Let's go.”</t3914>
<t3915>Radar shone the flashlight towards the Hole of Evil but Ben pulled him back forcefully.</t3915> <t3916>“We.</t3916> <t3917>Have. To. Get. Out. Of. Here.” Lacey looked at me, her eyes wide open, probably a bit annoyed because I had promised her that she would be safe.</t3917>
<t3918>“Alright,” I said.</t3918> <t3919>“Let's go out, through the doorway.</t3919> <t3920>Quick and tidy.” I had just taken a step when I heard a thunderous voice: “WHO'S IN THERE!”</t3920>
<t3921>How annoying.</t3921> <t3922>“Um,” I replied, “we're just looking around.” Truly a first-class cowardly excuse.</t3922> <t3923>From Lo Qui, a beam of white light blinded me.</t3923> <t3924>It could very well be God.</t3924>
<t3925>"What's the intention here?" The voice slightly feigned an English–English accent.</t3925>
<t3926>I saw Ben standing up next to me.</t3926> <t3927>It's good not to be alone.</t3927> <t3928>"We are investigating a missing person case," he said with radiant confidence.</t3928> <t3929>"We don't intend to cause any harm."</t3929> <t3930>The light moved away, and I blinked in the darkness until I saw the shapes of three people, all wearing jeans, t-shirts, and gas masks.</t3930> <t3931>One person pulled the mask up to their forehead and looked at us.</t3931> <t3932>I recognized the goatee and the wide mouth with thin lips.</t3932>
<t3933>"Mr. Gus?" Lacey asked, standing up.</t3933> <t3934>He is the security guard at the SunTrust building.</t3934>
<t3935>“Lacey Pemberton. Oh my God.</t3935> <t3936>What are you guys doing here?</t3936> <t3937>No masks? There's a ton of asbestos here.”</t3937>
<t3938>"What are you doing here?"</t3938>
<t3939>“Exploring,” he replied.</t3939> <t3940>For some reason, Ben suddenly became more confident, stepping forward in front of the other two and proactively extending his hand for a handshake.</t3940> <t3941>They introduced themselves as Ace and Carpenter.</t3941> <t3942>I guessed that those were their “ghost” names.</t3942>
<t3943>We pulled a few swivel chairs together, sitting in a near circle facing each other. "Were you the ones who punched through the wooden boards out there?" Gus asked.</t3943>
<t3944>"I just hit it," Ben explained.</t3944>
<t3945>“We sealed it up because we didn't want others to get inside.</t3945> <t3946>If people from the street see an entrance, many will come, mostly those who know nothing about exploration.</t3946> <t3947>Wanderers, idlers, and addicts of all kinds.”</t3947>
<t3948>I walked towards them and asked, "So, do you guys, uh, know if Margo has been here?"</t3948>
<t3949>Gus hadn't had time to reply when At spoke through the mask.</t3949> <t3950>His voice was slightly distorted but still understandable.</t3950> <t3951>“Heavens, Margo has been here all the time.</t3951> <t3952>We only come by a few times a year; this place has a lot of asbestos, and there's nothing particularly special about it.</t3952> <t3953>But in recent years, more than half the times we've come, we've seen the girl here.</t3953> <t3954>She's been doing quite well, hasn't she?”</t3954>
<t3955>“Why 'already'?” Lacey asked perceptively.</t3955>
<t3956>“The girl has left, hasn't she?”</t3956>
<t3957>"What do you know about that?"</t3957>
<t3958>“Oh God, I don't know anything.</t3958> <t3959>I saw Margo hanging out with this guy,” Gus said, pointing at me, “a few weeks ago.</t3959> <t3960>Then I heard she ran away from home.</t3960> <t3961>A few days later, I suddenly remembered she might have come here, so we decided to drop by and check it out.”</t3961>
<t3962>“I don't understand why the girl likes this place so much. There's nothing special about it,” said the Carpenter.</t3962> <t3963>“There's nothing exciting to explore.</t3963><t3964>”</t3964>
<t3965>“What do you mean by exploring?” Lacey asked Gus.</t3965>
<t3966>“Exploring the city.</t3966> <t3967>We go into abandoned buildings, explore and take photos.</t3967> <t3968>We don't take anything, nor do we leave anything behind, we just like to observe.</t3968><t3969>”</t3969>
<t3970>“Just a hobby,” At said. “Back in school, Gus often dragged Margo along on such adventures.”</t3970>
<t3971>“The girl has a very keen eye, and back then she was only, let's see, thirteen years old,” Gus said.</t3971> <t3972>“She could find her way into anywhere.</t3972> <t3973>Back then it was only occasionally, but now we go exploring three times a week.</t3973> <t3974>There are places to see everywhere.</t3974> <t3975>There was a recently abandoned mental hospital in Clearwater. An amazing place.</t3975> <t3976>We got to see how they used to tie up the crazies and give them electric shocks.</t3976> <t3977>There's an old prison to the west of here.</t3977> <t3978>But Margo isn't really into exploring.</t3978> <t3979>She likes to get inside, but then she just wants to stay in one spot.”</t3979>
<t3980>“Yeah, it's so annoying I could die,” Át added.</t3980>
<t3981>The Carpenter said, "The girl didn't even bother to take pictures.</t3981> <t3982>She also didn't run around looking at this and that.</t3982> <t3983>She just wanted to get inside and sit down.</t3983> <t3984>Do you remember she always carried that black notebook?</t3984> <t3985>She would just sit in the corner and write, as if she were at home, like doing homework."</t3985>
<t3986>“Actually,” Gus said, “Margo never really participated in the fun.</t3986> <t3987>All those adventures.</t3987> <t3988>In fact, she seemed quite gloomy.”</t3988>
<t3989>I wanted to let them talk, because I realized that all those words would help me imagine Margo. But suddenly, Lacey stood up abruptly and kicked the chair behind her.</t3989> <t3990>"Have you guys never thought about asking why Margo was so down?"</t3990> <t3991>"Or why Margo followed you guys to these obscure places?"</t3991> <t3992>"Have you guys never wondered why?" Lacey stood right in front of Gus, screaming wildly.</t3992> <t3993>Gus also stood up, towering over Lacey by a whole head.</t3993> <t3994>The Carpenter intervened, "Oh my God, someone calm this shrew down."</t3994>
<t3995>"Oh no!" Ben screamed. Before I could understand what was happening, Ben had already closed in on the Carpenter, knocking him off his chair and slamming his shoulder onto the floor.</t3995> <t3996>Ben sat on top of him and began to pummel him furiously and foolishly, punching and slapping his mask, shouting, "YOU'RE NOTHING BUT A WITCH!"</t3996> <t3997>I lunged forward to grab one of Ben's arms, while Radar held the other.</t3997> <t3998>We pulled Ben away, but he kept yelling, "I'm furious! Hitting you is so much fun! Hitting you more would be even better!"</t3998>
<t3999>“Ben,” I called, trying to keep my voice calm, trying to sound like my mother.</t3999> <t4000>“Ben, it's okay.</t4000> <t4001>You've made your point clear.”</t4001>
<t4002>Gus and Art helped the Carpenter up, Gus said, "My God, we can leave, right? It's all yours."</t4002>
<t4003>Picked up their cameras and all three quickly went out the back door.</t4003> <t4004>Lacey began to explain how she knew Gus, "He was a senior while we were just freshmen–."</t4004> <t4005>But I brushed it off, that didn't matter anymore.</t4005>
<t4006>Radar knows what is important.</t4006> <t4007>He immediately turned back to the calendar, his eyes only a few inches from the page.</t4007> <t4008>“There’s probably nothing written on the May page,” he said.</t4008> <t4009>“The paper is very thin and I don't see any marks.</t4009> <t4010>But it's hard to be sure.”</t4010> <t4011>He continued to look for more clues.</t4011> <t4012>I saw the lights of Lacey and Ben dip down as they crawled through a Devil's Hole, but I just stood there in the office, imagining Margo. I thought about her following those guys earlier, four years older than her, into abandoned buildings.</t4012> <t4013>That was the Margo I had seen.</t4013> <t4014>But then, inside those buildings, she wasn’t the Margo I always imagined anymore.</t4014> <t4015>While everyone else was exploring, taking pictures, and jumping over walls, Margo sat on the floor, writing something.</t4015>
<t4016>Ben's voice called out from the next room, "Q! We have something!"</t4016>
<t4017>I raised my sleeve to wipe the sweat off my face, leaning on Margo's desk to stand up straight.</t4017> <t4018>I walked across the room, crawled through the Devil's Hole, heading towards the three beams of light sweeping across the wall above the rolled carpet.</t4018>
<t4019>"Look at this," Ben said, shining a light to draw a square on the wall.</t4019> <t4020>"Do you remember the small holes you talked about?"</t4020>
<t4021>"Hmm?"</t4021>
<t4022>"There must have been some souvenirs attached here.</t4022> <t4023>This postcard, these pictures, we thought so, based on the spacing between the holes.</t4023> <t4024>Maybe Margo already took those things with her," Ben said.</t4024>
<t4025>"Yes, maybe," I replied.</t4025> <t4026>"If only we could find the notebook Gus just mentioned."</t4026>
<t4027>“Yeah, hearing him talk about it, I remember seeing that notebook,” Lacey said, the beam from my flashlight only illuminating her feet.</t4027> <t4028>“Margo always had that notebook.</t4028> <t4029>I never saw her write in it, but I guess it was a planner or something like that.</t4029> <t4030>God, I never asked Margo about it.</t4030> <t4031>I made a fuss with Gus, and he wasn’t even Margo’s friend.</t4031> <t4032>But did I ever ask her myself?”</t4032>
<t4033>“Margo won't answer either,” I said.</t4033> <t4034>It's such a lie to pretend that Margo isn't involved in her own distraction.</t4034>
<t4035>We walked around for another hour.</t4035> <t4036>Just as I was beginning to feel sure that this trip would yield nothing, my flashlight happened to sweep over some brochures of subdivisions that had been arranged into the shape of a house when we first arrived here.</t4036> <t4037>One of the brochures was for Grovepoint Acres.</t4037> <t4038>I held my breath as I spread out the other brochures.</t4038> <t4039>I quickly went to the backpack by the door and came back with a pen and notebook, writing down the names of all the subdivisions advertised.</t4039> <t4040>One name I immediately recognized: Collier Farms—one of the two ghost towns I had marked but not yet visited.</t4040> <t4041>I wrote them all down and put the notebook back in the backpack.</t4041> <t4042>Call me selfish, but if I found Margo, I wanted it to be just the two of us.</t4042>
<t4043>17.</t4043>
<t4044>Friday, when my mom came home from work, I reported that I was going to see a concert with Radar, but then I drove straight out to the countryside, Seminole County, to Collier Farms.</t4044> <t4045>All the other subdivisions in the brochure had ultimately been completed–most of them located to the north of the city, an area that had been fully developed a long time ago.</t4045>
<t4046>I recognized the turn into Collier Farms only because I had become an expert at identifying the faint roads blending into the ground.</t4046> <t4047>But Collier Farms was unlike any ghost town I had ever been to.</t4047> <t4048>This place was overgrown with weeds, as if it had been abandoned for fifty years.</t4048> <t4049>It was unclear whether this place had been abandoned longer than other ghost towns, or if the low terrain and swampy, damp soil caused everything to grow faster.</t4049> <t4050>As soon as I turned, I saw that I couldn't continue down the road into Collier Farms because the overgrown blackberry bushes blocked the entire path.</t4050>
<t4051>I walked down on foot.</t4051> <t4052>The sedge grass brushed against my shins, and my sneakers sank into the mud with each step.</t4052> <t4053>I couldn't help but hope that Margo had set up a tent somewhere, on a small patch of land slightly higher than the rest by about half a meter and not waterlogged by rain.</t4053> <t4054>I walked slowly, because this place needed more observation than others, because there were more hiding spots, and because I knew this ghost town was directly connected to the mini-mall.</t4054> <t4055>The ground was very thick, and I walked really slowly to take in every new landscape, checking spots large enough to hide a person.</t4055> <t4056>At the end of the street, I saw a blue and white cardboard box on the muddy ground, for a moment it looked very much like the nutrition bar box I had seen in the mini-mall.</t4056> <t4057>But, no.</t4057> <t4058>It was an old, tattered box, the kind that holds twelve bottles of beer.</t4058> <t4059>I struggled back to the car, headed north, to a place called Logan Pines.</t4059>
<t4060>The journey took an hour, now I am near the Ocala National Forest, no longer really within the Orlando metropolitan area.</t4060> <t4061>I was a few miles away when Ben called.</t4061>
<t4062>"What's going on?"</t4062>
<t4063>“Are you going to the paper towns?” Ben asked.</t4063>
<t4064>"Yes, I am almost at the last place that I know."</t4064> <t4065>"Nothing yet."</t4065>
<t4066>"So listen up, buddy, Radar's parents had to leave the city because of some extremely urgent business."</t4066>
<t4067>"Is everything still okay?" I asked, knowing that Radar's grandparents were very old and lived in a nursing home in Miami.</t4067>
<t4068>“Alright, the thing is: do you remember the old man in Pittsburgh who has the second largest collection of black Santas in the world?”</t4068>
<t4069>"Yes, what?"</t4069>
<t4070>"He has just passed away."</t4070>
<t4071>"Are you kidding?"</t4071>
<t4072>“Hey, I'm not joking about the life and death of those black Santa Claus collectors.</t4072> <t4073>He had an aneurysm.</t4073> <t4074>Radar's parents are on a flight to Pennsylvania to try to buy back the old man's collection.</t4074> <t4075>So we'll have some guests.</t4075><t4076>”</t4076>
<t4077>"Who are we?"</t4077>
<t4078>"You, me, and Radar."</t4078> <t4079>"We are the owners."</t4079>
<t4080>"I don't know yet," I said.</t4080>
<t4081>After a moment of silence, Ben called my full name, "Quentin," he said, "I know you want to find Margo.</t4081> <t4082>I know Margo is the most important thing to you.</t4082> <t4083>That's commendable.</t4083> <t4084>But we have just one more week until graduation.</t4084> <t4085>I'm not telling you to give up your search.</t4085> <t4086>I'm inviting you to come to a party with the two best friends you've known for half your life.</t4086> <t4087>I'm inviting you to spend about two or three hours sipping some sweet, cold drinks with a hint of alcohol, like a good girl, and another two or three hours throwing up those drinks through your nose.</t4087> <t4088>Then you can continue investigating abandoned house projects.” I felt uncomfortable because Ben only wanted to talk about Margo when the adventure intrigued him, because he thought I had a problem for only thinking about Margo and forgetting my friends, even though she was missing and they were not.</t4088> <t4089>But Ben is Ben, as Radar said.</t4089> <t4090>And anyway, after Logan Pines, I had nothing left to search for.</t4090> <t4091>“I'll go to this last place and then I'll come over to you guys.”</t4091>
<t4092>Because Logan Pines is the last ghost town in Central Florida—or at least the last one I know of—I placed a lot of hope in this place.</t4092> <t4093>But when I walked around the only dead-end street with a flashlight, I didn't see any shacks.</t4093> <t4094>There were no signs of fire.</t4094> <t4095>No food packaging.</t4095> <t4096>No traces of humans.</t4096> <t4097>No Margo. At the end of the road, I saw a single concrete foundation embedded in the ground.</t4097> <t4098>But nothing was built on top of it, just a sunken foundation pit like the gaping mouth of a corpse, with thorny bushes and waist-high weeds tangled and growing around it.</t4098> <t4099>If Margo really wanted me to see these places, I still don't understand why she wanted that.</t4099> <t4100>And if Margo had gone to these ghost towns and never returned, she knew of a place that my searches had not uncovered.</t4100>
<t4101>It took an hour and a half to drive back to Jefferson Park, I went home to park the car, put on a collared T-shirt and my best jeans, then walked through Jefferson Way to Jefferson Court, turned right onto Jefferson Road.</t4101> <t4102>There were a few cars already parked along both sides of Jefferson Place, Radar's street.</t4102> <t4103>It was only eight-forty-five.</t4103>
<t4104>I opened the door.</t4104> <t4105>Radar greeted me, arms full of black Santa Claus figurines made of plaster. "We have to put away the nicest ones," it said.</t4105> <t4106>"God forbid any of them get broken."</t4106>
<t4107>“Do you need my help?” I asked.</t4107> <t4108>Radar nodded towards the living room.</t4108> <t4109>On the tables along the sofa were three sets of nesting dolls shaped like black Santa Clauses.</t4109> <t4110>While nesting them together, the smaller doll fitting neatly inside the larger one, I couldn't help but admire the very beautiful dolls—hand-painted and extremely delicate.</t4110> <t4111>But I didn't dare mention it to Radar for fear he would kill me with the black Santa Claus lamp in the living room.</t4111>
<t4112>I brought the set of dolls to the guest bedroom for Radar to carefully store in the drawer.</t4112> <t4113>"You know, seeing all these Black Santas together in one place really makes you question the way we imagine folklore."</t4113>
<t4114>Radar's eyes widened.</t4114> <t4115>"Yeah, I always ask myself how I come up with my anecdotes while eating Lucky Charms cereal every morning with a spoon shaped like a Black Santa Claus.</t4115><t4116>"</t4116>
<t4117>A hand placed on my shoulder and turned me around. It was Ben, his legs bouncing around like he needed to pee.</t4117> <t4118>"We kissed."</t4118> <t4119>Lacey kissed me.</t4119> <t4120>About ten minutes ago.</t4120> <t4121>On Radar's parents' bed."</t4121>
<t4122>"Gross," Radar said.</t4122> <t4123>"Don't be making out on my parents' bed."</t4123>
<t4124>“Oh wow, I see you’ve got the hang of it already,” I teased.</t4124>
<t4125>"You pimp!"</t4125>
<t4126>"Stop it, it's so annoying!" Ben said, looking at me, almost straight in the eyes, "I don't think I did very well."</t4126>
<t4127>“What are you doing?”</t4127>
<t4128>“It's her.</t4128> <t4129>Think about it, over the years Lacey has kissed way more than I have.</t4129> <t4130>I don't want to be so bad at kissing that she dumps me.</t4130> <t4131>The girls would bury you,” he said to me, which is only true if you define girls as “the girls in the marching band.</t4131><t4132>”</t4132>
<t4133>“Hey sir, I am asking for advice here.”</t4133>
<t4134>I almost stirred up Ben's endless chatter about the different ways it could be applied with different girls, but then I just said, "In my humble opinion, there are two basic principles: 1. Don't bite randomly without permission, and 2. The human tongue is like mustard: intensely memorable, but use it sparingly."</t4134>
<t4135>Ben's eyes suddenly lit up with panic.</t4135> <t4136>I blushed and said, "He's standing behind me, isn't he?"</t4136>
<t4137>“‘The human tongue is like mustard,’” Lacey mimicked me in a dull, deep voice that I hoped did not actually resemble mine.</t4137> <t4138>I turned around.</t4138> <t4139>“Actually, I think Ben's tongue is more like sunscreen,” Lacey continued.</t4139> <t4140>“Good for health and needs to be applied generously.</t4140><t4141>”</t4141>
<t4142>"I'm going to throw up in my own mouth," Radar groaned.</t4142>
<t4143>"Lacey, you just took away my will to move forward," I added.</t4143>
<t4144>"I wish I could stop my imagination," Radar said.</t4144>
<t4145>I continued, "That very idea is so offensive that, in fact, mentioning the phrase 'Ben Starling's tongue' on television is illegal.</t4145><t4146>"</t4146>
<t4147>“The punishment for the lawbreaker is ten years in prison or a tongue bath from Ben Starling,” Radar sentenced.</t4147>
<t4148>"Oh dear," I said.</t4148>
<t4149>"Also chose," Radar smiled with closed lips.</t4149>
<t4150>“The prison,” we both concluded.</t4150>
<t4151>And then Lacey kissed Ben right in front of us.</t4151> <t4152>"Oh my God," Radar groaned, throwing his arm in front of his face.</t4152> <t4153>"Oh my God, I'm blind, I'm blind."</t4153>
<t4154>"Oh no," I said, "you guys are making the black Santas sad."</t4154>
<t4155>The party wrapped up in the VIP lounge on the second floor of Radar's house, with a total of twenty kids.</t4155> <t4156>I leaned against the wall, my head a few inches away from a portrait of a black Santa Claus painted on velvet.</t4156> <t4157>Radar's house had a very large sofa, so everyone gathered around it.</t4157> <t4158>There was beer in a cooler next to the TV, but no one drank any.</t4158> <t4159>Instead, one after another, they told stories.</t4159> <t4160>Most of them I had heard before—awkward and hilarious stories, stories about Ben Starling, stories about first kisses—but Lacey hadn't heard any of them, and anyway, they were all very funny.</t4160> <t4161>I was mostly an outsider until Ben grabbed me by the neck, “Q, how do you think you'll graduate?”</t4161>
<t4162>I bit my lip and said, "The mortal under the robe.</t4162><t4163>"</t4163>
<t4164>"That's more like it!" Ben took a sip of Dr Pepper.</t4164>
<t4165>"I won't be wearing any clothes, don't think I'm scared," Radar declared.</t4165>
<t4166>“Me too!”</t4166> <t4167>Q, you swore you wouldn't bring any clothes.”</t4167>
<t4168>I laughed, "I solemnly swear."</t4168>
<t4169>"I'm joining in!" our friend Frank said.</t4169> <t4170>More and more boys joined in, increasing the number of naked bodies under the robes.</t4170> <t4171>The girls had reasons to resist.</t4171>
<t4172>Radar turned to Angela, "Your veto makes me question the foundation of our relationship."</t4172>
<t4173>“You don't understand anything,” Lacey said.</t4173> <t4174>“We are not afraid.</t4174> <t4175>It's just that we have already chosen the dresses to wear.”</t4175>
<t4176>Angela pointed at Lacey, immediately responding.</t4176> <t4177>"Exactly." Then Angela added, "You guys should hope it doesn't get windy that day."</t4177>
<t4178>"I actually hope for strong winds," Ben said.</t4178> <t4179>"Fresh air is good for the world's biggest marbles.</t4179><t4180>"</t4180>
<t4181>Lacey covered her face in embarrassment. "You are a difficult boyfriend," Lacey said.</t4181> <t4182>"A proper one, but difficult." We laughed uproariously.</t4182>
<t4183>This is what I love most about my friends: just sitting together and chatting.</t4183> <t4184>Window stories and mirror stories.</t4184> <t4185>I just listen– the stories in my mind are not as cheerful and lively.</t4185>
<t4186>I can't help but think about high school and the end of it all.</t4186> <t4187>I like just standing next to the sofa and watching my friends—it seems a bit sad, but I feel okay, and I just listen, letting all the joys and sorrows of this ending swirl around me, one grinding against the other.</t4187> <t4188>For the longest moment, it felt like my chest was splitting open, but not in an unpleasant way.</t4188>
<t4189>I went home before midnight.</t4189> <t4190>The others stayed later, but that was my curfew, and I didn't want to stay any longer.</t4190> <t4191>Mom was dozing on the sofa, but she sat up when she saw me.</t4191> <t4192>"Did you have fun, dear?"</t4192>
<t4193>“Yes,” I replied, “I'm trembling with excitement.”</t4193>
<t4194>“Just like you, huh,” mom laughed.</t4194> <t4195>That feeling made me feel elated, but I didn't say anything.</t4195> <t4196>Mom stood up, pulled me into her arms, and kissed my cheek.</t4196> <t4197>“I love being your mom.”</t4197>
<t4198>"Thank you, Mom," I said.</t4198>
<t4199>I climbed into bed with a Whitman book, turned to the part I like, where he spends all his time listening to opera and others.</t4199>
<t4200>After all that listening, he wrote, "I am revealed... severed in the bitter hail."</t4200> <t4201>Perfect, I thought: I listen to others so that I can imagine them, I hear all the horrors and wonders that people inflict upon themselves and upon others, but ultimately, the act of listening reveals more about myself than it does about those I am striving to listen to.</t4201>
<t4202>Wandering through ghost towns and trying to listen to her didn't crack the shell of Margo Roth Spiegelman as much as it cracked me.</t4202> <t4203>A few pages later–listening and being exposed–Whitman began to write about all the journeys he could undertake in his imagination, and listed all the places he could visit while lying peacefully on the grass.</t4203> <t4204>“My palm covers continents,” he wrote.</t4204>
<t4205>I still think about maps, like when I was a child, sometimes I would look at maps, and just looking at them gave me a feeling as if I were somewhere else.</t4205> <t4206>This is what I have to do.</t4206> <t4207>I have to listen and imagine my path in her map.</t4207>
<t4208>But hadn't I already tried to do that?</t4208> <t4209>I had looked at the maps hanging above my computer.</t4209> <t4210>I had tried to chart out the route she might take, but like the grass carrying too many metaphors, Margo also had too many.</t4210> <t4211>It seemed impossible to pin her down on the maps.</t4211> <t4212>She was too small and the space on the maps was too large.</t4212> <t4213>These maps were more than just a waste of time—they were the tangible manifestation of completely useless conclusions, my absolute inability to create palms that could cover continents, to have a mind that could imagine correctly.</t4213>
<t4214>I stood up, went to the maps, and tore them off the wall, the thumbtacks popping out of the paper and scattering on the floor.</t4214> <t4215>I crumpled the maps and threw them all into the trash can.</t4215> <t4216>When I returned to the bed, I stupidly stepped on a thumbtack.</t4216> <t4217>Even though I was angry, exhausted, and out of ideas, drained of even the ghost towns, I still had to pick up the scattered thumbtacks on the carpet to avoid stepping on them again.</t4217> <t4218>I just wanted to pound the wall with all my might, but I had to pick up all these damn stupid thumbtacks first.</t4218> <t4219>Once done, I returned to the bed, punched the pillow hard, my teeth clenched tightly.</t4219>
<t4220>I tried to read Whitman again, but between the pages of the book and thoughts of Margo, I felt that tonight I had been exposed enough already.</t4220> <t4221>Finally, I put the book down, not even bothering to get up and turn off the light.</t4221> <t4222>I just stared at the wall, gradually closing my eyes for longer periods.</t4222> <t4223>Every time I opened my eyes, I saw the wall with maps hanging on it—four holes forming a rectangle, with pinholes scattered within that rectangle.</t4223> <t4224>I had seen this pattern before.</t4224> <t4225>In the empty room, above the rolled-up carpet.</t4225>
<t4226>A map. With marked locations.</t4226>
<t4227>18.</t4227>
<t4228>I woke up in the sunlight, not yet seven o'clock on Saturday morning. Surprisingly, Radar was already online.</t4228>
<t4229>RESURRECTED: I thought you were still sleeping.</t4229>
<t4230>CITIZENOFTHETOTALBOOK96: What era.</t4230> <t4231>I woke up at six o'clock, adding to an article about a Malaysian pop singer.</t4231> <t4232>But Angela was still sleeping.</t4232>
<t4233>QKẺHỒISINH: Oh, Angela stayed overnight</t4233><t4234>?</t4234>
<t4235>CITIZENOFTHETOTALBOOK96: Yes, but my youthfulness is still intact.</t4235> <t4236>But on graduation night...</t4236> <t4237>That's the plan. THE RESURRECTED: Hey man, last night I suddenly thought about this.</t4237> <t4238>Those small holes on the wall in the abandoned shopping area—could it be that there used to be a map and points marked with thumbtacks?</t4238>
<t4239>CITIZENOFTHEWHOLEBOOK96: Like a route.</t4239>
<t4240>QKẺHỒISINH: Exactly.</t4240>
<t4241>CITIZENOFTHETOTAL96: Do you want to go see the stars?</t4241>
<t4242>But I have to wait for Ange to wake up. THE RESURRECTED: Sounds good.</t4242>
<t4243>Radar called at ten o'clock.</t4243> <t4244>I drove the minivan to pick him up and then went to Ben's house, hoping that a surprise attack was the only way to wake him up.</t4244> <t4245>But even singing "You Are My Sunshine" at the top of our lungs outside his window only resulted in him cracking the window open and haughtily telling us, "I'm not doing anything until noon."</t4245>
<t4246>So it was just Radar and me hitting the road.</t4246> <t4247>He talked a little about Angela, how much he liked her, and how strange it felt that after only a few months of dating, they were going to different colleges.</t4247> <t4248>But I could hardly listen properly.</t4248> <t4249>I wanted that map.</t4249> <t4250>I wanted to see the places Margo had marked.</t4250> <t4251>I wanted to pin those thumbtacks back on the wall.</t4251>
<t4252>We entered through the office area, hurried through the library, stopped to quickly check the holes in the bedroom walls, and then went to the souvenir shop.</t4252> <t4253>This place no longer scared me at all.</t4253> <t4254>Once inside and certain that I was alone, I felt as safe as if I were at home.</t4254> <t4255>Under a display counter, I saw the box containing maps and travel brochures that I had rummaged through during the night of the party.</t4255> <t4256>I picked up the box, balancing it on the corners of a display cabinet with broken glass.</t4256> <t4257>Radar sifted through it first, taking out everything with maps, then I opened them up to check for any holes.</t4257>
<t4258>Near the bottom of the box, Radar lifted up a stack of black and white prints titled FIVE THOUSAND AMERICAN CITIES. Copyright 1972 by the Esso company.</t4258> <t4259>When carefully opening it, trying to smooth out the curled edges, I saw a pinhole in the corner.</t4259> <t4260>“Here it is,” I whispered excitedly.</t4260> <t4261>Around the pinhole, there was a small tear, looking like the paper had been ripped off the wall.</t4261> <t4262>It was a map of the United States, the kind you hang in a classroom, with brittle and yellowed paper, densely printed with potential destinations.</t4262> <t4263>The small tear in the corner told me that Margo did not intend to leave this map as a clue—she was too precise and certain with her clues to play a misleading game.</t4263> <t4264>Fate had led us to a part Margo had not anticipated, and seeing what she had not anticipated made me think about how much she had planned.</t4264> <t4265>And perhaps, I thought, that’s what she had been doing in the quiet darkness here.</t4265> <t4266>Wandering while sitting still, like Whitman, while preparing for what was real.</t4266>
<t4267>I ran straight to the office and saw a handful of push pins on the table next to Margo's desk.</t4267> <t4268>Then Radar and I carefully carried the flattened map to Margo's room.</t4268> <t4269>I held it up against the wall while Radar tried to pin the corners, but three out of the four corners were torn, as were three out of the five points on the map, likely torn when the map was removed from the wall.</t4269> <t4270>"Higher, to the left," Radar said. "No, down.</t4270> <t4271>There. Don't move." Finally, we had the map on the wall.</t4271> <t4272>We aligned the holes in the paper with the holes in the wall, and the five push pins easily went into place.</t4272> <t4273>But some holes on the map were torn too large to determine the EXACT position. And exact positioning is very valuable on a map densely packed with five thousand place names.</t4273> <t4274>The tiny, densely packed letters required me to stand on the rolled-up carpet and press my eyes close to guess each place name.</t4274> <t4275>While I read the city names aloud, Radar took out a handheld calculator and looked them up in the Everything Encyclopedia.</t4275>
<t4276>There are two pinholes that are not torn: one seems to be Los Angeles, although there are a multitude of cities clustered together in Southern California, causing the print to overlap.</t4276> <t4277>Another intact pinhole is above Chicago.</t4277> <t4278>A torn pinhole in New York, based on the position of the hole on the wall, is in one of the five boroughs of New York City.</t4278>
<t4279>“Matches with what we already know.</t4279><t4280>”</t4280>
<t4281>“Yes,” I said.</t4281> <t4282>“But my God, where in New York is this?</t4282> <t4283>That’s the problem.”</t4283>
<t4284>“We are missing something,” Radar said.</t4284> <t4285>“Some clue about the location.</t4285> <t4286>What are the remaining pinholes?”</t4286>
<t4287>"Another one in New York State, but not near the city."</t4287> <t4288>"You see, all the places are tiny."</t4288> <t4289>"It could be Poughkeepsie or Woodstock or Catskill Park."</t4289>
<t4290>“Woodstock,” Radar said.</t4290> <t4291>“This place is cool.</t4291> <t4292>Margo doesn't seem like a hippie, but she has the spirit of a free soul.”</t4292>
<t4293>“I don't know,” I said.</t4293> <t4294>“The final point could be Washington, D.C., or Annapolis, or Chesapeake Bay. Actually, this point could be endless.</t4294><t4295>”</t4295>
<t4296>“It would be more useful if there was only one point on the map,” Radar snapped.</t4296>
<t4297>“But who knows if Margo wants to go from one place to another,” I said.</t4297> <t4298>Immersing herself in her endless journey.</t4298>
<t4299>I sat down on the carpet for a while as Radar read aloud information about New York, the Catskill Mountains, the capital, the Woodstock concert in 1969.</t4299> <t4300>It seemed like nothing was related.</t4300> <t4301>I felt like we were following a thread and finding nothing.</t4301>
<t4302>That afternoon, after bringing Radar home, I sat around the house reading "Autobiography," half-focused on studying for exams. Monday's exams were calculus and Latin, probably the two hardest subjects, so I couldn't completely neglect them.</t4302> <t4303>I studied almost all of Saturday night and all day Sunday, but just after dinner, thoughts of Margo suddenly popped into my head.</t4303> <t4304>I temporarily set aside my Ovid translation exercises and logged into online messaging.</t4304> <t4305>Lacey was online.</t4305> <t4306>I had just learned Lacey's online nickname through Ben, but I figured Lacey and I were familiar enough for me to send her a direct message right away.</t4306>
<t4307>QKẺHỒISINH: Hi, it's Q here.</t4307>
<t4308>VẢIGAIVÀTROTÀN: Hello there!</t4308>
<t4309>QKẺHỒISINH: Have you ever thought about how much time Margo spent planning it all?</t4309>
<t4310>VẢIGAIVÀTROTÀN: Oh, like leaving a note in the soup bowl before going to Mississippi and directing you to that mini shopping mall?</t4310>
<t4311>QKẺHỒISINH: Yes, those things cannot be resolved by just thinking for ten minutes.</t4311>
<t4312>VẢIGAIVÀTROTÀN: The notebook? QKẺHỒISINH: Exactly.</t4312>
<t4313>VẢIGAIVÀTROTÀN: Oh right.</t4313> <t4314>Today I also thought about the notebook.</t4314> <t4315>I remember once when we went shopping together, Margo kept trying to fit the notebook into the wallets she liked to see if it would fit.</t4315>
<t4316>QKẺHỒISINH: It would be good to have that notebook.</t4316>
<t4317>VẢIGAIVÀTROTÀN: Yes, but I'm sure he brought it along.</t4317>
<t4318>QKẺHỒISINH: Hmm, it's not in Margo's locker at school</t4318><t4319>?</t4319>
<t4320>VẢIGAIVÀTROTÀN: No, there are only textbooks in there, neatly arranged as usual.</t4320>
<t4321>I sat studying and waiting for the others to come online.</t4321> <t4322>A while later, Ben appeared, and I invited him into the chat room with me and Lacey.</t4322> <t4323>The two of them mostly talked to each other—I was still halfway through translating—until Radar logged in and joined us.</t4323> <t4324>At that point, I put down my pen and stopped studying.</t4324>
<t4325>CITIZENOFENCYCLOPEDIA96: Today, someone in New York City searched for the name Margo Roth Spiegelman in the Encyclopedia of Everything.</t4325>
<t4326>CHỈVIÊMTHẬNTHUIMÀ: Do you know any place in New York City?</t4326>
<t4327>CITIZENOFTHETOTALBOOK96: Sorry, no.</t4327>
<t4328>VẢIGAIVÀTROTÀN: There are still some flyers in the record stores there.</t4328> <t4329>Maybe someone is trying to learn about Margo.</t4329>
<t4330>CITIZENOFTHEWORLD96: Oh, that makes sense.</t4330> <t4331>I forgot about that.</t4331> <t4332>That's really disappointing!</t4332>
<t4333>QKẺHỒISINH: Hey, I might appear here on and off, because I'm accessing the website that Radar pointed out, the one that maps out many routes from the places Margo has marked.</t4333>
<t4334>CHRONIC NEPHRITIS: What is the pathway?</t4334>
<t4335>QKẺHỒISINH: longwayaround.</t4335> <t4336>com</t4336>
<t4337>CITIZENOFTHEWORLD96: I have a new hypothesis.</t4337> <t4338>Margo will appear at the graduation ceremony, sitting in the audience.</t4338>
<t4339>CHỈVIÊMTHẬNTHUIMÀ: I follow the old hypothesis, Margo is still somewhere in Orlando, stirring us up and ensuring that she is the center of our universe.</t4339>
<t4340>VẢIGAIVÀTROTÀN: Ben!</t4340>
<t4341>CHỈVIÊMTHẬNTHUIMÀ: Sorry, but I'm absolutely right.</t4341>
<t4342>They just kept going like that, talking to each other about their Margo, while I tried to map out her route.</t4342> <t4343>If Margo did not intend for the map to be a clue—and the torn holes on the map indicated that she did not—I concluded that we had all the clues she intentionally left behind, and now we had even more.</t4343> <t4344>So surely I had what I needed.</t4344> <t4345>But why did I still feel so distant from Margo.</t4345>
<t4346>19.</t4346>
<t4347>After three hours alone with eight hundred words of Ovid on Monday morning, I walked down the hallway, feeling like my brain was about to drip out of my ears.</t4347> <t4348>But I did fine on the test.</t4348> <t4349>We had an hour and a half for lunch, to give our brains time to solidify again before the second exam of the day.</t4349> <t4350>Radar was waiting in front of my locker.</t4350>
<t4351>“I just bombed myself in Spanish,” Radar said.</t4351>
<t4352>“You will definitely do well.” He will go to Dartmouth on a huge scholarship.</t4352> <t4353>Radar is more than smart enough.</t4353>
<t4354>“I don't know either, sir.</t4354> <t4355>I was dozing off during the oral exam.</t4355> <t4356>But hey, I stayed up until midnight to write this program.</t4356> <t4357>It's pretty neat.</t4357> <t4358>It allows you to enter an entry—maybe a geographical region or some animal genus—and then you can read the first sentences of about a hundred articles in the Encyclopedia of Everything on the subject you need, all on a single page.</t4358> <t4359>For example, you're looking for a certain type of rabbit but can't remember the exact name.</t4359> <t4360>You can read the introductions of all twenty-one rabbit species on the same page, in, let's see, three minutes.”</t4360>
<t4361>"Are you doing this the night before the exam?" I asked.</t4361>
<t4362>“Yeah, I know, so what? But I'll send it to you via email.</t4362> <t4363>This game is really mind-bending.”</t4363>
<t4364>Ben appeared. "Q, I swear to God, Lacey and I were online until two in the morning, messing around with that duongdaivongquanh site.</t4364> <t4365>After checking every route Margo could take from Orlando to those five points, I concluded that I had been completely wrong from the start.</t4365> <t4366>Margo is not in Orlando.</t4366> <t4367>Radar was right.</t4367> <t4368>She will come back on graduation day."</t4368>
<t4369>"Why?"</t4369>
<t4370>“The perfect timing.</t4370> <t4371>Driving from Orlando to New York to the mountains to Chicago to Los Angeles and then back to Orlando is exactly a twenty-three-day trip.</t4371> <t4372>Moreover, this trick is really deep, but that's Margo's style.</t4372> <t4373>Making everyone believe that she's gone.</t4373> <t4374>Creating a mysterious smoke screen, hiding herself in it so that everyone has to pay attention.</t4374> <t4375>And then when the attention starts to fade, suddenly showing up at graduation.”</t4375>
<t4376>“No,” I said.</t4376> <t4377>“No way.”</t4377> <t4378>Now I understand Margo better.</t4378> <t4379>She wants to be noticed.</t4379> <t4380>I believe so.</t4380> <t4381>But Margo doesn't joke with life to have fun.</t4381> <t4382>She didn't leave just to play a prank like that.</t4382>
<t4383>"Hey buddy, I'm talking to you."</t4383> <t4384>"Find Margo at that graduation ceremony."</t4384> <t4385>"She will show up, you'll see." I just shook my head.</t4385> <t4386>Everyone had lunch at the same time, so the cafeteria was packed, and we exercised our senior privilege by driving to Wendy's for ice cream.</t4386> <t4387>Trying to focus on the upcoming calculus exam, but I started to feel like the story needed more connections.</t4387> <t4388>If Ben was right about the twenty-three-day journey, that would indeed be very interesting.</t4388> <t4389>Maybe that's what Margo had planned in her black notebook, a long and solitary road trip.</t4389> <t4390>That doesn't explain everything, but it fits with a Margo who likes to plan.</t4390> <t4391>That doesn't mean it brings me any closer to her.</t4391> <t4392>Identifying a dot on a torn map was hard enough; when the dot moves, it's even harder.</t4392>
<t4393>After a long day full of exams, returning to the pleasant inviolability of "Tự khúc" is almost a light relief.</t4393> <t4394>I read a very strange passage of the poem—after all the time listening and hearing people, then wandering with them, Whitman no longer listens and no longer wanders, he begins to become other people.</t4394> <t4395>As if truly being inside them.</t4395> <t4396>He tells the story of the captain of a ship who saved everyone on board, except himself.</t4396> <t4397>Whitman says that the poet can tell the story because he has become that captain.</t4397> <t4398>When he writes, "I am that man...</t4398> <t4399>I endure...</t4399> <t4400>I was there." A few lines later, it becomes even clearer that Whitman no longer needs to listen to become someone else: "I do not ask the wounded person how he feels...</t4400> <t4401>I myself become the wounded person."</t4401>
<t4402>I put the book down and lay on my side, looking out the window that had always been between me and her.</t4402> <t4403>Just seeing or hearing her was not enough.</t4403> <t4404>To find Margo Roth Spiegelman, one must become Margo Roth Spiegelman.</t4404>
<t4405>I did many things she might have done: I created a pair least likely to attend a gala together.</t4405> <t4406>I silenced the hounds of the class war.</t4406> <t4407>I was naturally comfortable in the haunted house where the rats reigned supreme, where she had done most of her thinking.</t4407> <t4408>I saw.</t4408> <t4409>I listened.</t4409> <t4410>But I have yet to become the bearer of the wound.</t4410>
<t4411>The next day, I was sluggish throughout the physics exam and the government and politics class, then on Tuesday stayed up until 2 AM to finish the final essay for the National Language subject, about Moby Dick.</t4411>
<t4412>Ahab is a hero, I have decided that.</t4412> <t4413>There is no particular reason for this decision—especially since I haven't read the book—but I have decided it and just went on writing.</t4413>
<t4414>The shortened exam week means that Wednesday is our last day at school.</t4414> <t4415>Throughout that day, it was hard not to wander around, thinking about all the lasts: The last time standing with the group in a circle outside the music room, under the oak tree that has sheltered generations of talented musicians.</t4415> <t4416>The last time eating pizza in the cafeteria with Ben. The last time sitting in this school, one hand hurriedly writing an essay, the other hand wedged between the pages of a blue book.</t4416> <t4417>The last time glancing at the clock.</t4417> <t4418>The last time seeing Chuck Parson trudging through the hallway, with a fleetingly disdainful and nonchalant smile.</t4418> <t4419>Oh my.</t4419> <t4420>I'm starting to feel nostalgic about Chuck Parson, of all people. Some kind of illness must be taking over me.</t4420>
<t4421>For Margo, it must have been the same.</t4421> <t4422>With all the time spent planning, she must have known she was going to leave, even though she wasn't entirely immune to emotions.</t4422> <t4423>She had some beautiful days here.</t4423> <t4424>In the final moments, it was hard to recall the bad days, because in one way or another, she had spent part of her life in this place, just like I did.</t4424> <t4425>This city is paper, but the memories are not.</t4425> <t4426>Everything I did here, all the affection, sorrow, compassion, cruelty, and malice, it's all filling up inside me.</t4426> <t4427>The white-painted honeycomb walls.</t4427> <t4428>My white walls.</t4428> <t4429>Margo's white walls.</t4429> <t4430>We had been trapped between those walls for too long, stuck in its belly like Jonah was stuck in the belly of the whale.</t4430>
<t4431>All day long, I had thought that perhaps this emotion was the reason why she planned everything so meticulously and precisely: even if you want to go, leaving is still very difficult.</t4431> <t4432>It needs to be prepared, and perhaps sitting down to plan in that abandoned shopping mall was both an intellectual and emotional task—the way Margo envisioned herself embarking on her destiny.</t4432>
<t4433>Ben and Radar practiced music tirelessly to ensure that they would make everyone rock during the "Pomp and Circumstance" march at the graduation ceremony.</t4433> <t4434>Lacey said she could give me a ride home, but I decided to clean out my locker because I didn't want to come back to school and feel my lungs drowning in the stubborn nostalgia that surged up.</t4434>
<t4435>My locker is purely a chaotic mess–half filled with trash, half filled with books.</t4435> <t4436>Margo's locker was still neatly organized when Lacey opened it, I still remember, as if Margo planned to return to school the very next day.</t4436> <t4437>I pulled the trash can closer to the row of lockers and opened mine.</t4437> <t4438>I started with a photo of Radar, Ben, and me, the three of us lazily staring blankly.</t4438> <t4439>I put the photo into my backpack, then began the horrifying process of picking out all the filthy things accumulated over the year–wads of gum wrapped in torn notebook paper, countless empty pens, grease-stained tissues–I tossed them all into the trash can.</t4439> <t4440>All the while, I kept thinking, I will never do this again, I will never be here again, this will never be my locker again, Radar and I will never pass notes in calculus again, I will never see Margo walking in the hallway again.</t4440> <t4441>For the first time in my life, there were so many things that would never happen again.</t4441>
<t4442>And finally, it was too much.</t4442> <t4443>I couldn't control the flow of emotions, and the feelings became unbearable.</t4443> <t4444>I delved deep into the drawer, pulling out everything—photos, notes, and books—and swept them all into the trash.</t4444> <t4445>I left the drawer open and walked away.</t4445> <t4446>Passing by the music room, I heard the song "Pomp and Circumstance" muffled through the walls.</t4446> <t4447>I kept walking. Outside, it was hot, but not as hot as usual.</t4447> <t4448>Bearable.</t4448> <t4449>The way home was mostly sidewalk, I thought.</t4449> <t4450>So I kept walking.</t4450>
<t4451>Just as dazed and worn out as all the never-agains, this final departure was truly perfect.</t4451> <t4452>Pure.</t4452> <t4453>The most easily distilled form of liberation.</t4453> <t4454>All attachments, except for a lousy photo, stayed in the trash, but the feeling was wonderful.</t4454> <t4455>I started to walk quickly, wanting to widen the distance between me and the school.</t4455>
<t4456>Leaving is truly difficult—until we leave.</t4456> <t4457>And then it becomes the easiest thing in the world.</t4457>
<t4458>While running, I felt like I was becoming Margo for the first time.</t4458> <t4459>I knew: she was not in Orlando.</t4459> <t4460>She was not in the state of Florida. Leaving felt too wonderful, once you had left.</t4460> <t4461>If I were in a car, not walking, I would have driven away forever.</t4461> <t4462>Margo had left and would not return for graduation or anything else.</t4462> <t4463>Now I felt certain.</t4463>
<t4464>I left, and the departure was so exhilarating that I knew I might never return.</t4464> <t4465>But then what?</t4465> <t4466>Would I continue to leave somewhere, to depart and depart again, plunging myself into an endless journey?</t4466>
<t4467>Ben and Radar drove by when I was a quarter mile from Jefferson Park.</t4467> <t4468>Ben abruptly stopped RHAPAW right on Lakemont, despite the surrounding traffic.</t4468> <t4469>I ran over and got into the car.</t4469> <t4470>The two guys wanted to come to my house to play Resurrection, but I had to say no, because I was closer than ever.</t4470>
<t4471>20.</t4471>
<t4472>Throughout Wednesday night and all day Thursday, I tried to leverage my new understanding of Margo to derive some meaning from the clues I had—the connection between the map and the travel books, or between Whitman and the map, connections that would help me understand her wanderlust language.</t4472> <t4473>But I increasingly felt that perhaps the joy of departure had captivated Margo to the extent that she didn't really care to leave a complete trail of breadcrumbs.</t4473> <t4474>If that were the case, the map Margo didn't intend for us to discover might be the best chance to find her.</t4474> <t4475>But no location on the map was precise enough.</t4475> <t4476>Even Catskill Park, which caught my attention because it was the only place not in or near a major city, was still too vast, too crowded to search for a single individual.</t4476> <t4477>"Song of Myself" led to places in New York City, but there were too many locations to track.</t4477> <t4478>How could one pinpoint a location on the map when that point seemed to always be moving from one city to another?</t4478>
<t4479>On Friday morning, I had woken up and was flipping through travel guides when my parents came into my room.</t4479> <t4480>Both of them rarely came into my room at the same time, I started to feel uneasy—maybe there was bad news about Margo—then suddenly remembered that today was my graduation day.</t4480>
<t4481>"Ready, son?"</t4481>
<t4482>"Yes. It's not very grand, but it will be fun."</t4482>
<t4483>“You only graduate from high school once in your life,” said Mom.</t4483>
<t4484>"Yes," I replied.</t4484> <t4485>My parents sat down on the edge of the bed and looked at me.</t4485> <t4486>Both of them giggled and glanced at each other.</t4486> <t4487>"What's going on?" I asked.</t4487>
<t4488>“Well, your father and I wanted to give you a graduation gift,” Mom said.</t4488> <t4489>“Quentin, we are really proud of you.</t4489> <t4490>You are the most precious treasure in our lives, today is a big day for you, and we–You really are a good boy.”</t4490>
<t4491>I smiled and looked down.</t4491> <t4492>And then Dad took out a very small gift box, wrapped in sky-blue wrapping paper.</t4492>
<t4493>“No,” I exclaimed, hastily grabbing it.</t4493>
<t4494>"Open it, son."</t4494><t4495>"</t4495>
<t4496>“Impossible,” I said, still staring at the box.</t4496> <t4497>The size of a key.</t4497> <t4498>The weight of a key.</t4498> <t4499>I shook it, the box rattled like a key.</t4499> <t4500>“Hurry up and open it, dear,” my mother urged me.</t4500>
<t4501>I tore the wrapping paper. A KEY! I looked closely. A Ford car key! My family doesn't have any Ford.</t4501> <t4502>"Did you buy a car for me, Mom and Dad?"</t4502>
<t4503>"Yes," Dad said. "It's not brand new—but it's only been driven for two years and about twenty thousand miles."</t4503><t4504>"</t4504>
<t4505>I jumped up and hugged both my dad and mom. "Is it mine?"</t4505>
<t4506>"Yes!" Mom almost shouted.</t4506> <t4507>I have a car! A car!</t4507> <t4508>My very own!</t4508>
<t4509>I pulled myself away from my parents and screamed, "Thank you, Dad! Thank you, Mom! Thank you, Dad! Thank you, Mom! Thank you, Dad! Thank you, Mom!" while dashing through the living room, flinging open the front door, wearing only an old t-shirt and shorts.</t4509> <t4510>There, parked in the driveway and adorned with a huge sky-blue bow, was a Ford minivan.</t4510>
<t4511>My parents gave me a minivan.</t4511> <t4512>They could have chosen any type of car, and they chose a minivan.</t4512> <t4513>A minivan.</t4513> <t4514>Oh, Vehicle Justice God, why do you mock me so?</t4514> <t4515>Minivan, you are a yoke around my neck, an indelible shame!</t4515> <t4516>You are a high-roofed, low-powered monster!</t4516>
<t4517>I put on a brave face and turned around.</t4517> <t4518>"Thank you, Dad. Thank you, Mom!" I said, though my voice lacked enthusiasm because I was completely acting.</t4518>
<t4519>“We noticed that you really like driving your mom's car,” mom said.</t4519> <t4520>My parents beamed—clearly believing that they had given their son the vehicle of his dreams.</t4520> <t4521>“Hanging out with friends will be a lot of fun!” dad added.</t4521> <t4522>And just think: these two specialize in analyzing and understanding human psychology.</t4522>
<t4523>“Well,” Dad said, “we should go early to get good seats.</t4523><t4524>”</t4524>
<t4525>I haven't showered or changed clothes, haven't done anything at all.</t4525> <t4526>Well, that doesn't mean I'll actually get dressed, but it still takes time.</t4526> <t4527>"You don't have to be there until twelve-thirty," I said.</t4527> <t4528>"I still need to get ready."</t4528>
<t4529>Dad furrowed his brow, "Yes, but I want to sit somewhere with a good view to take pictures–"</t4529>
<t4530>I interrupted my dad, "I can GO BY MYSELF," I said.</t4530> <t4531>"I can DRIVE MY OWN CAR to school," I grinned.</t4531>
<t4532>"Mom knows already!" Mom was also very happy.</t4532> <t4533>Heavens and earth, a car is still a car no matter what.</t4533> <t4534>Driving my minivan is definitely a step up compared to driving someone else's minivan.</t4534>
<t4535>I went back to the computer and immediately bragged to Radar and Lacey (Ben was not online) about the minivan.</t4535>
<t4536>GLOBALCITIZEN96: That's great news!</t4536> <t4537>Can I leave my cooler in the back of your car?</t4537> <t4538>I have to take my parents to the graduation ceremony and don't want them to see the cooler.</t4538>
<t4539>QKẺHỒISINH: Sure, the car isn't locked.</t4539> <t4540>What is the cooler for?</t4540>
<t4541>CITIZENOFTHEREALM96: Well, at the party at my house, no one drank beer, there are still 212 bottles left, I'll bring them to Lacey's house for her to throw a party tonight.</t4541>
<t4542>THE RESURRECTED ONE: 212 bottles of beer?</t4542>
<t4543>CITIZENOFTHEWORLD96: That big box.</t4543>
<t4544>Ben went online, SCREAMING that he had bathed thoroughly, stark naked, and just needed to put on a hat and slip into his robe.</t4544> <t4545>We chatted about the graduation ceremony in the nude.</t4545> <t4546>After everyone had logged off to get ready, I went into the bathroom, stood straight to let the water hit my face directly, and started thinking while the water kept pouring.</t4546> <t4547>New York or California? Chicago or D.C.?</t4547> <t4548>Now I could go too, I thought.</t4548> <t4549>I have a car, just like she has one.</t4549> <t4550>I could go to all five points on the map, and even if I didn't find her, it would be more fun than a melting hot summer in Orlando.</t4550> <t4551>But no.</t4551> <t4552>It's like sneaking into SeaWorld.</t4552> <t4553>It requires meticulous planning, excellent execution, and then–nothing.</t4553> <t4554>And just like SeaWorld, except darker.</t4554> <t4555>Margo had told me: the fun part isn't in the execution; the fun part is in the planning process itself.</t4555>
<t4556>Those were the things I thought about while standing under the shower: the planning process.</t4556> <t4557>Margo sat in the mini-mall with a notebook, outlining plans.</t4557> <t4558>She might be arranging a road trip, using the map to visualize the routes.</t4558> <t4559>She read Whitman and marked “I embark on the perpetual journey,” because that’s the kind of thing she likes to imagine herself doing, the kind of thing she likes to plan.</t4559>
<t4560>But is that the kind of work she really likes to do? No.</t4560> <t4561>Because Margo knows the secret of leaving, the secret I have just understood: leaving is only wonderful and pure when you leave something important, something meaningful to you.</t4561> <t4562>Uprooting life from its roots.</t4562> <t4563>But you can't do that until your life has taken root.</t4563>
<t4564>So when Margo left, she left forever.</t4564> <t4565>But I don't believe that she left for an endless journey.</t4565> <t4566>I feel certain that she left to go to a place—a place where she could stay long enough for it to become meaningful, long enough so that the next departure would feel as wonderful as the previous one.</t4566> <t4567>There is a corner in this world, somewhere far from here, where no one knows what "Margo Roth Spiegelman" means.</t4567> <t4568>And Margo is sitting in that corner, writing in her black notebook.</t4568>
<t4569>The water is starting to get cold.</t4569> <t4570>Still haven't touched the soap, but I get out, wrap a towel around my waist, and sit down by the computer.</t4570>
<t4571>I searched through Radar's email for the program in his Encyclopedia of Everything, and downloaded it to my computer.</t4571> <t4572>The program ran very smoothly.</t4572> <t4573>First, I entered the central Chicago area code, selected "location," and searched within a twenty-mile radius.</t4573> <t4574>Hundreds of results came up, from Navy Pier to Deerfield. The first sentence of each entry appeared on my screen, and I skimmed through them in about five minutes.</t4574> <t4575>Nothing stood out.</t4575> <t4576>I tried again with an area code near Catskill Park in New York. This time there were fewer results, eighty-two, sorted by the date the entries were created in the Encyclopedia of Everything. I began reading: Woodstock, New York, is a town in Ulster County, New York, perhaps best known for the namesake music festival [see Woodstock Festival] in 1969, a three-day event featuring artists from Jimi Hendrix to Janis Joplin, which actually took place in a nearby town. Lake Katrine is a small lake in Ulster County, New York, frequently visited by Henry David Thoreau.</t4576> <t4577>Catskill Park covers 2,800 square kilometers, located in the Catskill Mountains, co-managed by the federal government and local authorities, including 5 percent ownership by New York City; part of the city's drinking water is sourced from lakes in Catskill Park.</t4577> <t4578>Roscoe, New York, is a small community, according to the most recent census, consisting of 261 households.</t4578> <t4579>Agloe, New York, is a fictitious village, created by the Esso company in the early 1930s and appearing on tourist maps, serving as a copyright trap, or a paper town.</t4579>
<t4580>I clicked on the link to read the full article, continuing with:</t4580>
<t4581>Located at the intersection of two dirt roads north of Roscoe, NY, Agloe is the creation of mapmakers Otto G. Lindberg and Ernest Alpers, who formed the name Agloe by combining the initials of their names.</t4581> <t4582>Copyright traps have existed in the cartography industry for many centuries.</t4582> <t4583>Cartographers create fictitious locations, streets, and cities, placing them in hard-to-find spots on their maps.</t4583> <t4584>If those fictitious place names are found on another cartographer's map, it is certain that a map has been illicitly copied.</t4584> <t4585>Copyright traps are also known as trap streets, paper streets, and paper towns [see fictitious entries].</t4585> <t4586>Although only a few mapping entities acknowledge the existence of copyright traps, they remain a common feature in today's maps.</t4586>
<t4587>In the 1940s, Agloe, New York, began appearing on the maps of other companies.</t4587> <t4588>Esso suspected copyright infringement and prepared legal proceedings, but in reality, an unidentified person had built an "Agloe General Store" at the intersection that appeared on Esso's map.</t4588>
<t4589>This house, which still exists [citation needed], is the only building in Agloe, continues to appear on many maps, and is often accompanied by a population statistic of zero.</t4589>
<t4590>Each article in the Encyclopedia of Everything has a supplementary page to view all the edits, revisions made, and any comments from Encyclopedia members about that article.</t4590> <t4591>The article about Agloe has not been edited for nearly a year, but recently there was a comment from an anonymous visitor.</t4591>
<t4592>To know, for anyone editing this article–the population of Agloe is actually counted as of noon on May 29.</t4592>
<t4593>I immediately recognized this capitalization style.</t4593> <t4594>The conventional capitalization rules are very unfair to words that are not at the beginning of a sentence.</t4594> <t4595>My throat suddenly tightened, but I forced myself to calm down.</t4595> <t4596>The comment was written fifteen days ago.</t4596> <t4597>It had always been there, waiting for me.</t4597> <t4598>Looking at the clock on the computer, I had less than twenty-four hours left.</t4598>
<t4599>For the first time in weeks, Margo became completely, undeniably, alive to me.</t4599> <t4600>She was still alive.</t4600> <t4601>At least for one more day, she was still alive.</t4601> <t4602>I had focused for so long on Margo's wanderings, being obsessed with the tangled mess of wondering whether she was alive or not, for so long that I didn't realize how scared I had been until now.</t4602> <t4603>Oh, thank God. She was still alive.</t4603>
<t4604>I jumped up, letting the towel fall, and immediately called Radar.</t4604> <t4605>I wedged the phone between my neck and shoulder while putting on my underwear and shorts.</t4605> <t4606>“I know what paper towns mean now!</t4606> <t4607>Do you have a handheld computer there?”</t4607>
<t4608>“Yes.</t4608> <t4609>You really should be here already.</t4609> <t4610>They're about to make us line up.”</t4610>
<t4611>I heard Ben shouting over the phone.</t4611> <t4612>"Tell him to dress in casual clothes rather than a robe!"</t4612>
<t4613>"Radar," I called, trying to make it understand the gravity of the situation. "Look up the page about Agloe, New York.</t4613> <t4614>Alright?"</t4614>
<t4615>“Yeah. Reading.</t4615> <t4616>Wait a minute. Oh. Oh. It must be the pinhole in Catskill on the map, right?”</t4616>
<t4617>"Yes, I think so too. It's very close."</t4617> <t4618>"Continue reading the discussion."</t4618>
<t4619>"..."</t4619>
<t4620>"Radar?"</t4620>
<t4621>"Oh my God."</t4621>
<t4622>“I know, I know!” I shouted.</t4622> <t4623>I didn't hear him respond because I was quickly putting on a t-shirt, but when I put the phone back to my ear, I only heard Radar talking to Ben.</t4623>
<t4624>I hung up immediately.</t4624>
<t4625>Returning to the computer, I searched for driving directions from Orlando to Agloe, but the map system had never heard of Agloe, so I substituted it with Roscoe.</t4625> <t4626>At an average speed of sixty-five miles per hour, the computer said the trip would take nineteen hours and four minutes.</t4626> <t4627>It was two fifteen.</t4627> <t4628>I had twenty-one hours and forty-five minutes to get there.</t4628> <t4629>I printed out the directions, grabbed the keys to the minivan, and turned to lock the front door.</t4629>
<t4630>“It took nineteen hours and four minutes,” I said into the cell phone.</t4630> <t4631>On the other end was Radar's cell phone, but Ben was speaking.</t4631>
<t4632>“What do you intend to do?” it asked. “Are you going to fly there?”</t4632>
<t4633>"No, I don't have enough money, and that place is also about eight hours away from New York City.</t4633> <t4634>So I will drive there."</t4634>
<t4635>Suddenly, Radar took back the phone.</t4635> <t4636>“How long will it take?”</t4636>
<t4637>"Nineteen hours and four minutes."</t4637><t4638></t4638>
<t4639>"Who said that?"</t4639>
<t4640>"Google Maps."</t4640>
<t4641>"Not good," Radar said.</t4641> <t4642>"Those map programs don't account for traffic.</t4642> <t4643>I'll call back.</t4643> <t4644>Hurry up.</t4644> <t4645>We're already in line!"</t4645>
<t4646>"I'm not going." </t4646> <t4647>"You can't gamble with time," I said, but only the air listened.</t4647>
<t4648>One minute later, Radar called back.</t4648> <t4649>“If the average speed is sixty-five miles per hour, without stopping, and considering average traffic flow, it will take twenty-three hours and nine minutes.</t4649> <t4650>So you will arrive after one o'clock in the afternoon, which means you have to make up time as you go.</t4650><t4651>”</t4651>
<t4652>“What? But–”</t4652>
<t4653>Radar interrupted me, "I'm not criticizing, but perhaps for this specific issue, the chronically late person needs to listen to the always-on-time person.</t4653> <t4654>But you will have to be here for at least a second, otherwise your parents will freak out when your name is called and you're nowhere to be seen.</t4654> <t4655>Besides, although this isn't the most important issue, I might as well mention it now–all our beer is in your car."</t4655>
<t4656>“But I don't have time,” I replied.</t4656>
<t4657>Ben leaned into the phone.</t4657> <t4658>“Don't be so foolish.</t4658> <t4659>It only takes five minutes.”</t4659>
<t4660>“Well, I guess I have to.” I ran a red light that had just turned red, sped quickly—this car accelerates better than mom's car, but only just a bit—towards the school.</t4660> <t4661>I reached the parking lot of the multi-purpose sports complex in three minutes.</t4661> <t4662>I didn't park properly but just stopped the car in the middle of the lot and jumped out.</t4662> <t4663>Running towards the multi-purpose gym, I saw three people in robes running towards me.</t4663> <t4664>I could immediately see Radar's dark, reed-like legs under his flapping robe, Ben running right next to him, wearing sneakers without socks.</t4664> <t4665>Lacey was running behind.</t4665>
<t4666>"Take the beer out," I said as I ran past them.</t4666> <t4667>"I'll go report to my parents."</t4667>
<t4668>The family members of the final-year students sat in the rows of audience seats.</t4668> <t4669>I ran back and forth in the basketball court and finally saw my parents sitting halfway up the stands.</t4669> <t4670>Both of them were waving at me.</t4670> <t4671>I jumped up two steps at a time, so I was a bit breathless when I bent down to my parents and said, "So, I won't [breath] out when I'm called, because I [breath] think I found Margo and [breath] have to go right away, I turned on my mobile phone [breath] please don't be mad, thank you for the car."</t4671>
<t4672>Mom grabbed my wrist and asked, "What's wrong? What are you talking about, Quentin? Calm down."</t4672>
<t4673>I continued, "I will go to Agloe, New York, and I have to go right away."</t4673> <t4674>That's all there is to it.</t4674> <t4675>So, I'm leaving now, there's very little time left.</t4675> <t4676>I have my mobile phone with me.</t4676> <t4677>So, I love you, Mom and Dad."</t4677>
<t4678>I had to immediately withdraw from my mother's loosely holding hand.</t4678> <t4679>Before my parents could say anything, I had already sprinted down the stairs and dashed back to the car.</t4679> <t4680>I got into the car, started it, and was about to drive off when I looked over and saw Ben sitting in the passenger seat.</t4680>
<t4681>"Get the beer crate and get out of the car!" I shouted.</t4681>
<t4682>"We're leaving now," he said.</t4682> <t4683>"Driving long distances like this, you'll fall asleep for sure."</t4683>
<t4684>I turned around, Lacey and Radar were both holding their phones to their ears. “About to tell my parents,” Lacey explained, tapping her phone. “Come on Q. Let's go, let's go, let's go.”</t4684>
<t4685>PART III</t4685>
<t4686>Shell</t4686>
<t4687>8</t4687>
<t4688>The first hour</t4688>
<t4689>Each of us took a while to explain to our parents that 1.</t4689> <t4690>We would not be attending the graduation ceremony, and 2. We were driving to New York to 3.</t4690> <t4691>Check if a city really exists, and hopefully 4. Meet the person who posted a comment on Omnictionary, because based on the Random Capitalization Evidence, it was 5. Margo Roth Spiegelman.</t4691>
<t4692>Radar was the last one to put down the phone, finally announcing, "I declare this.</t4692> <t4693>My parents are very angry because I'm not attending the graduation ceremony.</t4693> <t4694>My girlfriend is also angry because we had planned to do something special in the next eight hours.</t4694> <t4695>I don't want to go into details, but this better be an epic road trip.</t4695><t4696>"</t4696>
<t4697>“Your ability to maintain your youthfulness is a great inspiration to all of us,” Ben, sitting next to me, said.</t4697>
<t4698>I glanced at Radar through the rearview mirror. "HOLD THE LINE, HOANG!" I shouted at him.</t4698> <t4699>Despite himself, a smile slowly spread across his face.</t4699> <t4700>The wonderful exhilaration of departures.</t4700>
<t4701>We are driving on the I-4 interstate, the traffic is relatively sparse, which makes it even more unexpectedly fortunate.</t4701> <t4702>I am driving in the far left lane, exceeding the speed limit of fifty-five miles per hour by eight miles per hour, because I once heard that you have to exceed by nine miles per hour to be stopped by the police.</t4702>
<t4703>Very quickly, we determined the roles of each person.</t4703>
<t4704>In the back row, Lacey was the supplier.</t4704> <t4705>She loudly took inventory of everything we currently had for the trip: half a Snickers bar that Ben had been eating when I called to report about Margo; 212 bottles of beer in the back of the car; the printed directions I had made; and the following items in Lacey's purse: eight breath mints, a pencil, some tissues, three tampons, a pair of sunglasses, some ChapStick lip balm, Lacey's house keys, a YMCA membership card, a library card, some receipts, thirty-five dollars in cash, and a BP card.</t4705>
<t4706>From her seat, Lacey exclaimed, "How fun! We’re like pioneers fighting bare-handed!</t4706> <t4707>But it would be better if we had more cash."</t4707>
<t4708>“At least we have the BP card,” I said. “So we can buy gas and food.</t4708><t4709>”</t4709>
<t4710>I looked through the rearview mirror and saw Radar in a robe glancing down at Lacey's wallet.</t4710> <t4711>The robe's neckline was a bit wide, so you could see a hint of Radar's chest hair.</t4711> <t4712>"Do you have men's shorts in your wallet?" he asked Lacey.</t4712>
<t4713>"Seriously, we should stop at the GAP clothing store," Ben interjected.</t4713>
<t4714>The task of Radar, which started with the handheld computer, is Research and Calculation.</t4714> <t4715>He sat alone in the row of seats right behind me, with the map and the user manual of this minivan spread out beside him.</t4715> <t4716>He calculated how fast we needed to go to arrive before noon tomorrow, how many times we needed to stop for gas, the locations of the BP stations along the route we would take, and how long each stop should be, how much time each slowdown to exit the highway would take.</t4716>
<t4717>“We will stop four times to refuel.</t4717> <t4718>Each stop must be very, very quick.</t4718> <t4719>It should take a maximum of six minutes to get off the highway.</t4719> <t4720>We need to be cautious of three fairly long sections under construction, plus the traffic in Jacksonville, Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia, although we have the advantage of passing through D.C. at around three in the morning.</t4720> <t4721>According to my calculations, the average cruising speed should be about seventy-two miles per hour.</t4721> <t4722>What is it right now?”</t4722>
<t4723>“Sixty-three,” I replied.</t4723> <t4724>“The speed limit is fifty-five.”</t4724>
<t4725>“Increase it to seventy-two,” it said.</t4725>
<t4726>"No, it's dangerous, I will be punished."</t4726><t4727></t4727>
<t4728>“Go seventy-two,” it reminded.</t4728> <t4729>I pressed down on the gas pedal.</t4729> <t4730>The difficulty was partly because I was reluctant to speed up to seventy-two miles, and partly because the minivan itself was also reluctant to speed up to seventy-two miles.</t4730> <t4731>It started to shake in a way that subtly hinted it was about to fall apart.</t4731> <t4732>I was still in the far left lane, even though I wasn't the fastest car on the road.</t4732> <t4733>I felt terrible as I kept overtaking, leaving other cars behind on the right, but I needed to get ahead, because unlike everyone else on the road, I couldn't slow down.</t4733> <t4734>And this was my role: driving and feeling stressed.</t4734> <t4735>It turned out I had played this role before.</t4735>
<t4736>And Ben? Ben's role was to need to pee.</t4736> <t4737>At first, it seemed his main role was to complain about why we didn't have any music CDs and that all the radio stations in Orlando were boring, except for the university station, which was now out of range.</t4737> <t4738>But soon enough, he blew that role away for a more faithful and genuine call: the need to pee.</t4738>
<t4739>"I need to pee," it said at 3:06.</t4739> <t4740>We had been on the road for forty-three minutes, with nearly a day of driving left.</t4740>
<t4741>“Well,” Radar replied, “the good news is we will stop.</t4741> <t4742>The bad news is we will stop in four hours and thirty minutes.”</t4742>
<t4743>"I think I can hold it," Ben said.</t4743> <t4744>At 3:10, he declared, "Actually, I really need to pee.</t4744> <t4745>Really."</t4745>
<t4746>The chorus responded, "Hold it!" It said, "But I–" And the chorus responded again, "Hold it!" It was fun, at least for now, Ben needed to pee and we needed him to hold it.</t4746> <t4747>He laughed uncontrollably, chattering that the more he laughed, the more he needed to pee.</t4747> <t4748>Lacey jumped up, leaned towards Ben, and started tickling his ribs.</t4748> <t4749>Ben shrieked with laughter and I laughed too, maintaining a speed of seventy-two miles per hour.</t4749> <t4750>I wondered whether Margo had accidentally or intentionally created this trip for us—either way, this was the most fun I had had since the last time I spent hours behind the wheel of a minivan.</t4750>
<t4751>Second hour</t4751>
<t4752>I am still driving.</t4752> <t4753>We turn north, onto the interstate I-95, cruising along the winding road that follows the Florida coastline, though not exactly right by the sea.</t4753> <t4754>Here, it's all pine trees, too spindly for their height, looking somewhat like me.</t4754> <t4755>But mostly it's just the road, overtaking other cars and occasionally being overtaken, always having to remember who is ahead, who is behind, who is getting closer and who is drifting away.</t4755>
<t4756>At this moment, Lacey and Ben are sitting next to each other on the bench, Radar at the end seat, the three of them playing the game I Spy in its old version, where players are only allowed to spot things that cannot be seen with the naked eye.</t4756> <t4757>"I spy with my little eye, something terribly stylish," Radar said.</t4757>
<t4758>“Is it the way Ben half-smiles, slightly lifting the right side of his mouth?” Lacey asked.</t4758>
<t4759>“No,” Radar replied. “And don't give Ben those sweet words, they sound too cheesy.”</t4759>
<t4760>“Is it the style of wearing cassocks under graduation gowns and driving to New York while passersby think we're wearing skirts?”</t4760>
<t4761>“No,” Radar replied. “Then it would just be terrible.</t4761><t4762>”</t4762>
<t4763>Lacey laughed.</t4763> <t4764>"You'll learn to like dresses, you'll see.</t4764> <t4765>You have to enjoy the cool breeze."</t4765>
<t4766>“Oh, I know!” I shouted down.</t4766> <t4767>“You discovered the twenty-four-hour road trip in a minivan.</t4767> <t4768>Stylish because road trips are always like that; terrible because the amount of gas we consume will destroy the planet.”</t4768>
<t4769>Radar still insisted it wasn't, and we continued guessing.</t4769> <t4770>I was driving, maintaining a speed of seventy-two miles per hour, hoping not to get a traffic ticket, and playing a metaphysical version of I Spy.</t4770> <t4771>The terribly stylish thing turned out to be that this rented robe wouldn't be returned on time.</t4771> <t4772>I pressed the gas pedal to speed past a police officer who was stopped on the median strip.</t4772> <t4773>I gripped the steering wheel with both hands, feeling certain that the officer would chase after me and pull me over.</t4773> <t4774>But he didn't chase after me, probably knowing that I was speeding because I had to.</t4774>
<t4775>The third hour</t4775>
<t4776>Ben returned to the front seat.</t4776> <t4777>I was still driving.</t4777> <t4778>We were all starving.</t4778> <t4779>Lacey handed out just one mint candy to each person, at least it was a bit refreshingly cool.</t4779> <t4780>He was writing a long list of things we would buy at the BP station during our first stop.</t4780> <t4781>That place better be a BP station with an extremely abundant stock because we were going to clean it out.</t4781>
<t4782>Ben continued to stagger with his legs.</t4782>
<t4783>"Can you stop?"</t4783>
<t4784>“I have needed to pee for three hours now.”</t4784>
<t4785>“He already said that.”</t4785>
<t4786>“I feel the urine rising up all over my chest,” it said.</t4786> <t4787>“Honestly, I am filled with urine.</t4787> <t4788>Right now, seventy percent of my body weight is urine.</t4788><t4789>”</t4789>
<t4790>“Alright, then,” I said, with a faint, bitter smile.</t4790> <t4791>Still very happy, but I was too tired.</t4791>
<t4792>“If I cry now, I will cry out urine.</t4792><t4793>”</t4793>
<t4794>The little monkey, I chuckled softly.</t4794>
<t4795>A few minutes later, I glanced over, and Ben had one hand covering his private area, the fabric of his robe bulging.</t4795>
<t4796>“What the hell is this?” I asked.</t4796>
<t4797>"Bồ ơi, tôi phải cho ra thôi."</t4797> <t4798>"Tôi phải thông dòng chảy thôi." Nó quay lại phía sau.</t4798> <t4799>"Radar ơi, còn bao lâu nữa thì dừng?"</t4799>
<t4800>“We have to travel at least one hundred and forty-three more miles to maintain the four-stop mark, which means we have one hour and fifty-eight point five minutes left, if Q can maintain the speed.</t4800><t4801>”</t4801>
<t4802>"I'm holding on tight!" I shouted.</t4802> <t4803>We were north of Jacksonville, near Georgia.</t4803>
<t4804>"I can't hold it in, Radar."</t4804> <t4805>"Give me something to vent on."</t4805><t4806>"</t4806>
<t4807>The choir erupted: NO.</t4807> <t4808>Absolutely not.</t4808> <t4809>Hold it in like a man.</t4809> <t4810>Hold your urge to urinate like a Victorian lady preserving her chastity.</t4810> <t4811>Hold it with dignity and self-respect, like the President of the United States, who is believed to hold the fate of the free world.</t4811>
<t4812>"GIVE ME SOMETHING OR I'LL PEE RIGHT HERE. HURRY UP!"</t4812>
<t4813>“Oh, my God,” Radar exclaimed and unbuckled his seatbelt.</t4813> <t4814>He crawled to the back seat, fumbling to open the cooler.</t4814> <t4815>He returned to his seat, stretched out to hand a beer bottle to Ben.</t4815>
<t4816>"Thank God this type can be unscrewed," Ben said, wrapping his robe around his hand and unscrewing the bottle.</t4816> <t4817>He lowered the window, and I looked out the side mirror to see the stream of beer flowing out of the car and splashing onto the road.</t4817> <t4818>Ben managed to get the bottle under his robe without letting us witness what were claimed to be the biggest balls in the world.</t4818> <t4819>We sat and waited, feeling too grossed out to look.</t4819>
<t4820>Lacey just said, "You can't hold it in, can you," when everyone heard it.</t4820> <t4821>I've never heard a sound like this before, but I knew right away what it was: the sound of urine hitting the bottom of a beer bottle.</t4821> <t4822>It almost sounded like music.</t4822> <t4823>A creepy kind of music with a very fast rhythm.</t4823> <t4824>I squinted over and saw the look of relief in Ben's eyes. He was smiling, his gaze distant and unfocused.</t4824>
<t4825>"The longer you wait, the more enjoyable it gets," he said.</t4825> <t4826>The sound shifted from the splattering of urine hitting the bottle to the plopping of urine falling on urine.</t4826> <t4827>Then slowly, Ben's smile faded.</t4827>
<t4828>"Hey buddy, I probably need another bottle," he suddenly declared.</t4828>
<t4829>“EMERGENCY, another bottle!” I shouted loudly.</t4829>
<t4830>“Another bottle over here!” In a flash, I saw Radar twist around, dive into the cooler, and quickly grab a bottle from the pile of ice.</t4830> <t4831>He twisted the cap off with his bare hands, pried open a window at the back, slipped the beer bottle out, and poured it away.</t4831> <t4832>Then he lunged forward, his head popping up between Ben and me, holding the bottle out to Ben. Ben's eyes were bulging with fright.</t4832>
<t4833>“The, uh, transfer is a bit, uh, complicated,” Ben said.</t4833> <t4834>A series of actions rustled under the robe.</t4834> <t4835>I tried not to imagine what was happening when a bottle of Miller Lite filled with urine (strangely resembling Miller Lite) emerged from the hem of the robe.</t4835> <t4836>Ben placed the full bottle into the cup holder, grabbed a new one from Radar, and sighed contentedly.</t4836>
<t4837>Meanwhile, the remaining kids were delighted to gaze at the bottle of urine in the cup holder.</t4837> <t4838>The road wasn't particularly bumpy, but the jolts on the bus were more than enough, causing the urine to slosh right up to the bottle's mouth.</t4838>
<t4839>"Ben, if you spill a drop in my brand new car, I'll deal with your two little balls."</t4839>
<t4840>Still peeing, Ben looked over at me with a sly smile.</t4840> <t4841>"You're going to need a huge, terrifying knife."</t4841> <t4842>Then finally, I heard the flow slow down.</t4842> <t4843>It was almost done, and with a swift motion, he threw the new bottle out the window.</t4843> <t4844>Next came the full bottle.</t4844>
<t4845>Lacey pretended—or maybe actually—covered her mouth and gagged.</t4845> <t4846>Radar said, "Oh my God, did you wake up this morning and drink eighteen gallons of water?"</t4846>
<t4847>But Ben grinned widely.</t4847> <t4848>He triumphantly punched the air, shouting loudly, "Not a drop spilled in the car! I am Ben Starling.</t4848> <t4849>The number one clarinet of the Winter Park school marching band. Beer Pong Champion! Car-internal champion.</t4849> <t4850>I shake the world! I am the best!”</t4850>
<t4851>Thirty-five minutes later, after having been on the road for nearly three hours, Ben softly asked, "When will we stop again?"</t4851>
<t4852>"One hour and three minutes more, if Q can maintain the speed," Radar replied.</t4852>
<t4853>“Alright,” Ben said. “Okay.</t4853> <t4854>Good.</t4854> <t4855>Because I need to pee.</t4855><t4856>”</t4856>
<t4857>Fourth hour</t4857>
<t4858>The first time Lacey asked, "Are we there yet?" We burst out laughing.</t4858> <t4859>But we were in Georgia, a state I both love and cherish for one and only one reason: the speed limit here is seventy, which means I can speed up to seventy-seven.</t4859> <t4860>Besides that, Georgia reminds me of Florida.</t4860>
<t4861>We spent an entire hour preparing for the first stop.</t4861> <t4862>This stop was important because I was very, very, very, very hungry and dehydrated.</t4862> <t4863>For some reason, talking about the food we would buy at BP made the hunger pangs subside.</t4863> <t4864>Lacey made a list of items for each person, writing very small on the back of the receipts still in his wallet.</t4864> <t4865>Lacey told Ben to stick his head out the front seat window to see which side the gas cap was on.</t4865> <t4866>He made us memorize the list and check if we had it down.</t4866> <t4867>We went over the tasks at the gas station repeatedly, everything needed to be smooth and quick like a race car stopping at the pit lane.</t4867>
<t4868>“Final rehearsal again,” Lacey said.</t4868>
<t4869>“I'll handle the gas,” Radar said.</t4869> <t4870>“After starting the pump, I'll run inside while the nozzle is still pumping, even though by law I have to stay by the pump, and give you the card.</t4870> <t4871>Then I'll run back to the pump.</t4871><t4872>”</t4872>
<t4873>“I gave the card to the guy at the checkout counter,” Lacey said.</t4873>
<t4874>"Or you," I added.</t4874>
<t4875>"It's irrelevant," Lacey said.</t4875>
<t4876>"I just want to say—don't be sexist."</t4876>
<t4877>“Okay, whatever.</t4877> <t4878>I give the card to the person at the checkout counter.</t4878> <t4879>I tell him or her to immediately enter everything we are taking out.</t4879> <t4880>Then I go to the bathroom.”</t4880>
<t4881>I added, "Meanwhile, I'll take the items from my list and bring them to the checkout counter."</t4881><t4882>"</t4882>
<t4883>Ben said, "I need to pee."</t4883> <t4884>"After I finish peeing, I will get the items on my list."</t4884>
<t4885>“The most important thing is the shirt,” Radar said.</t4885> <t4886>“People keep looking at me and laughing.</t4886><t4887>”</t4887>
<t4888>Lacey said, "I signed the bill after coming out of the restroom."</t4888>
<t4889>"As soon as the tank is full, I'll get in the car and drive off immediately, so you guys should already be in the car.</t4889> <t4890>I'll seriously leave your butts behind if you're not on time.</t4890> <t4891>We have six minutes," Radar said.</t4891>
<t4892>“Six minutes,” I said, nodding my head.</t4892> <t4893>Lacey and Ben repeated.</t4893> <t4894>“Six minutes.</t4894><t4895>”</t4895>
<t4896>"Six minutes." At 5:35 PM, with nine hundred miles traveled, Radar announced that, according to its handheld computer, the next exit would have a BP station.</t4896>
<t4897>As I pulled the car close to the station, Lacey and Radar were ready by the sliding door on the side of the car.</t4897> <t4898>Ben, having unbuckled his seatbelt, placed one hand on the door handle and the other on the dashboard.</t4898> <t4899>I tried to maintain the highest speed possible for as long as possible, then slammed the brakes right in front of the gas station.</t4899> <t4900>The car jerked to a stop, and we burst out of the car.</t4900> <t4901>Radar and I crossed paths in front of the car, I tossed the keys to him and sprinted straight into the convenience store.</t4901> <t4902>Lacey and Ben reached the door before me, but just barely.</t4902> <t4903>While Ben dashed into the restroom, Lacey explained to the salt-and-pepper-haired woman (who turned out to be an older lady!) that we were going to buy a lot and were in a hurry, so she should start ringing up the items as soon as we brought them to the counter, and everything would be paid for with Lacey's BP card.</t4903> <t4904>The older lady seemed a bit confused, but agreed nonetheless.</t4904> <t4905>Radar ran in, his robe billowing, and handed the card to Lacey.</t4905>
<t4906>Meanwhile, I ran along the aisles to get the items on my list.</t4906> <t4907>Lacey was in charge of drinks, Ben handled non-perishables, and I got the groceries.</t4907> <t4908>I swept through the place as if I were a leopard and the packaged chips were a herd of wounded antelopes.</t4908>
<t4909>I grabbed a bunch of potato chips, beef jerky, and peanuts, ran to the counter, then dashed to the candy section.</t4909> <t4910>A handful of Mentos, a handful of Snickers, and—oh, not on the list, but whatever, I like Nerds candy, so I grabbed three packs.</t4910> <t4911>I ran back to the checkout counter and continued with fresh food, including classic turkey sandwiches, where the turkey tasted just like bacon.</t4911> <t4912>I took two.</t4912> <t4913>On the way to the checkout counter, I stopped to grab some Starburst candy and Twinkies, plus an indeterminate amount of GoFast nutrition bars.</t4913> <t4914>I ran to the counter.</t4914> <t4915>Ben was standing there in his graduation gown, checking out a t-shirt and four-dollar sunglasses.</t4915> <t4916>Lacey ran over with several gallons of soda, energy drinks, and bottled water.</t4916> <t4917>Big bottles, the kind that even Ben's urine couldn't fill up.</t4917>
<t4918>“ONE MORE MINUTE!” Lacey shouted, and I panicked.</t4918> <t4919>I spun around, eyes darting all over the stall, trying to remember what I had forgotten.</t4919> <t4920>I glanced down at my list; it seemed I had everything, but I still felt like I was forgetting something very important.</t4920> <t4921>Something.</t4921> <t4922>Come on, Jacobsen.</t4922> <t4923>Chips, candy, turkey-that-looks-like-bacon, peanuts, beef jerky, and–what else?</t4923> <t4924>What was the other food group?</t4924> <t4925>Meat, potatoes, candy, and, and, and, and cheese! “CRACKERS!” I blurted out, a bit loudly, then dashed to the cracker aisle, grabbed cheese crackers, peanut butter crackers, added some Grandma’s peanut butter cookies, then ran back and dumped everything on the counter.</t4925> <t4926>The cashier had packed everything into four bags.</t4926> <t4927>It all came to nearly a hundred dollars, not counting the gas; I would have to pay Lacey’s parents back all summer.</t4927>
<t4928>Only a single moment of quiet after the cashier swiped Lacey's card.</t4928> <t4929>I glanced at the clock.</t4929> <t4930>We needed to be on the road in twenty seconds.</t4930> <t4931>Finally, we heard the receipt being printed.</t4931> <t4932>The cashier tore the receipt from the printer, Lacey scribbled her signature, Ben and I grabbed the bags and dashed to the car.</t4932> <t4933>Radar had the engine running as if to say hurry up, we ran across the parking lot, Ben's robe billowing in the wind making him look somewhat like a dark wizard, except for the pale legs showing and his arms full of bags.</t4933> <t4934>I saw Lacey's calves under her skirt, her muscles tensing with each stride.</t4934> <t4935>I didn't know how I looked, but I knew how I felt: Young.</t4935> <t4936>Foolish.</t4936> <t4937>Limitless.</t4937> <t4938>I watched Ben and Lacey dive into the car through the already open sliding door.</t4938> <t4939>Next was me, landing on the bags and Lacey.</t4939> <t4940>Radar sped off as I slammed the sliding door shut, he swerved the car out of the parking lot, marking the first time in the long history of minivans that someone somewhere had driven fast enough to screech the tires.</t4940> <t4941>Radar turned left onto the highway at an unsafe speed, then merged back onto the interstate.</t4941> <t4942>We were four seconds ahead of schedule.</t4942> <t4943>And just like a NASCAR pit stop, we high-fived and congratulated each other.</t4943> <t4944>So we were all set.</t4944> <t4945>Ben had everything he needed in case he had to relieve himself.</t4945> <t4946>I had enough beef jerky. Lacey had Mentos.</t4946> <t4947>Radar and Ben had t-shirts to wear over their robes.</t4947> <t4948>The minivan had become a biosphere—just keep filling it with gas and we could go on forever.</t4948>
<t4949>Fifth hour</t4949>
<t4950>Alright, perhaps in the end we weren't supplied as well as that.</t4950> <t4951>In the rush, it turned out that Ben and I made a few mistakes (though not fatal ones).</t4951> <t4952>Only Radar was in the front, Ben and I sat right behind, unpacking each bag and handing items to Lacey in the back row.</t4952> <t4953>It was Lacey's turn to sort the items into piles based on an organized structure that only Lacey understood.</t4953>
<t4954>“Why isn't NyQuil in the same place as NoDoz?” I asked.</t4954> <t4955>“Aren't they both medications?”</t4955>
<t4956>“Dear Q, you are too naive to understand this category. NoDoz goes with chocolate and Mountain Dew because they all contain caffeine and keep you awake.</t4956> <t4957>NyQuil goes with beef jerky because eating meat will make you tired.”</t4957>
<t4958>“That's really funny,” I said.</t4958> <t4959>When I handed Lacey the last item from my bag, she asked, “Q, where's the healthy food–you know?”</t4959>
<t4960>"Huh?"</t4960>
<t4961>Lacey handed me the written copy of the list and read, "Bananas.</t4961> <t4962>Apples.</t4962> <t4963>Dried cranberries. Raisins."</t4963>
<t4964>“Oh,” I lamented.</t4964> <t4965>“Oh right. The fourth food group isn't crunchy cookies.</t4965><t4966>”</t4966>
<t4967>"Oh Q, oh Q!" Lacey snapped. "I can't eat anything here!"</t4967>
<t4968>Ben touched Lacey's elbow.</t4968> <t4969>"Come on, but you can eat Grandma's cookies.</t4969> <t4970>Grandma won't hurt you."</t4970>
<t4971>Lacey blew a strand of hair out of her face, clearly looking quite annoyed.</t4971> <t4972>“It's just some GoFast bars,” I said to Lacey.</t4972> <t4973>“They have added vitamins!”</t4973>
<t4974>“Yes, vitamins and about thirty grams of fat,” Lacey replied.</t4974>
<t4975>From the front seat, Radar declared, "Stop badmouthing the GoFast bars.</t4975> <t4976>Do you guys want me to stop the car right now?"</t4976>
<t4977>"Every time I eat GoFast," Ben said, "I get the feeling 'So this is what blood tastes like to a mosquito.</t4977><t4978>'"</t4978>
<t4979>I unwrapped halfway a chocolate-flavored GoFast bar, waving it in front of Lacey's mouth, "Smell this," I said.</t4979> <t4980>"It has a nutritious vitamin scent."</t4980>
<t4981>"You're going to make me fat."</t4981>
<t4982>“And pimples,” Ben added.</t4982> <t4983>“Don't forget the pimples.”</t4983>
<t4984>Lacey took the cereal bar from my hand and reluctantly took a bite, having to close her eyes to hide the sheer delight of tasting a GoFast bar.</t4984> <t4985>"Oh. My. God.</t4985> <t4986>This tastes like hope."</t4986>
<t4987>Finally, we opened the last bag.</t4987> <t4988>Inside, there were two large-sized T-shirts.</t4988> <t4989>Radar and Ben looked visibly excited because they were about to become young-men-wearing-oversized-T-shirts-outside-baggy-clothes, no longer young-men-wearing-baggy-clothes.</t4989>
<t4990>But when Ben took off the shirt, there were two small problems.</t4990> <t4991>One was that it turned out that a large T-shirt from a gas station in Georgia was not the same as a large from, say, Old Navy.</t4991> <t4992>The large T-shirt from the gas station was enormous—it looked more like a garbage bag than a T-shirt.</t4992> <t4993>These ones were indeed smaller than robes, but not by much.</t4993> <t4994>But this problem paled in comparison to another issue: both T-shirts had a huge Confederate flag printed on them.</t4994> <t4995>Above the flag was the phrase HERITAGE NOT HATE.</t4995>
<t4996>“Oh no,” Radar exclaimed when I showed him what we were laughing at. “Ben Starling, you wouldn't buy your symbolically black friend a racist shirt, would you?”</t4996>
<t4997>"Brother, I just quickly grabbed the first thing I saw."</t4997>
<t4998>“Don't be all buddy-buddy with me right now,” Radar said, but he shook his head and laughed loudly.</t4998> <t4999>I handed the shirt to Radar, and he slipped it on while steering with his knees.</t4999> <t5000>“I hope I get pulled over by the cops,” he said.</t5000> <t5001>“I want to see how they react when they see a black guy wearing a Confederate flag T-shirt over a black skirt.</t5001><t5002>”</t5002>
<t5003>The sixth hour</t5003>
<t5004>For some reason, the stretch of I-95 extending south of Florence, South Carolina, is the place to drive on a Friday night. We were caught in a dilemma in a line of cars stretching for several miles.</t5004> <t5005>Even though Radar didn't expect to exceed the speed limit, it was fortunate that he could still manage thirty miles per hour.</t5005> <t5006>Radar and I sat in the front, trying not to worry by playing a game we just came up with, called That Guy Is a Gold Digger. In this game, the player has to imagine the lives of the people sitting in the other cars around us.</t5006>
<t5007>We drove alongside a Hispanic woman[9] in an old Toyota Corolla.</t5007> <t5008>I watched her as the sky began to darken.</t5008> <t5009>“Left her family to come here,” I said.</t5009> <t5010>“Living here illegally.</t5010> <t5011>Sends money home on the third Tuesday of every month.</t5011> <t5012>She has two small children–her husband is a migrant worker.</t5012> <t5013>Right now, her husband is in Ohio–he's only home about three or four months a year, but the couple is doing just fine.</t5013><t5014>”</t5014>
<t5015>Radar leaned forward, glancing at her for half a second.</t5015> <t5016>"Oh my God, Q, it's not that tragic."</t5016> <t5017>She is a secretary at a law firm—just look at her dress.</t5017> <t5018>It took nearly five years, but now she is about to get her law degree.</t5018> <t5019>She doesn't have children, nor is she married.</t5019>
<t5020>But he has a lover.</t5020> <t5021>He is easy-going, likes to be free, afraid of commitment.</t5021> <t5022>A white person, slightly worried about the interracial love syndrome in this whole affair."</t5022>
<t5023>“But she's wearing a wedding ring,” I remarked.</t5023> <t5024>To find a way to support Radar's point of view, I observed her more closely.</t5024> <t5025>She was on the right, a little shorter than me.</t5025> <t5026>I could see through the frosted window of her car, she was singing along to some song, eyes fixed on the road without blinking.</t5026> <t5027>There were too many people.</t5027> <t5028>It's easy to forget how crowded this world is, so crowded it could explode, we can imagine each person, and often imagine wrong.</t5028> <t5029>I felt this was an important idea, one of those thoughts that our brain has to slowly wrap around, like a python swallowing its prey.</t5029> <t5030>But before I could think any further, Radar spoke up.</t5030>
<t5031>“She wears a ring like that so that creeps like you won't dare to come near,” Radar explained.</t5031>
<t5032>“Maybe.” I smiled, taking a bite of the half-eaten GoFast bar in my lap.</t5032> <t5033>There was silence again for a moment, and I thought about how we can and cannot see people, about the frosted glass window between me and the woman driving to our right.</t5033> <t5034>Both she and I were in cars with windows and mirrors everywhere, while she murmured along driving next to us on this congested road.</t5034> <t5035>When Radar spoke up again, I realized it had been thinking too.</t5035>
<t5036>“The spirit of That Guy Is a Gold Digger,” Radar said, “I mean the spirit of this game, is that it ultimately reveals much more about the person imagining than the person being imagined.</t5036><t5037>”</t5037>
<t5038>“Yes,” I replied.</t5038> <t5039>“I was just thinking the same thing.” And I couldn't help but think that Whitman, for all his fierce beauty, might have been a bit too optimistic.</t5039> <t5040>We can hear others, reach out to them without moving, imagine them, and we are all connected by a crazy root system, like blades of grass—but this game makes me wonder if we can ever truly become someone else completely.</t5040>
<t5041>Seventh hour</t5041>
<t5042>Finally, we passed a heavy truck that had overturned, regaining our old speed.</t5042> <t5043>But according to Radar's calculations, we needed to drive seventy-seven miles per hour from here to Agloe.</t5043> <t5044>It had been exactly an hour since Ben declared he needed to pee, and the reason was quite simple: Ben was asleep.</t5044> <t5045>At exactly six o'clock, he drank NyQuil[10].</t5045> <t5046>He lay down in the back row of seats.</t5046> <t5047>Lacey and I fastened both seat belts around him.</t5047> <t5048>That would make Ben more uncomfortable, but 1.</t5048> <t5049>It was better for him, and 2. We all knew that in twenty minutes, no discomfort would bother him, because Ben would be dead asleep.</t5049> <t5050>And that was exactly the case.</t5050> <t5051>He would wake up at midnight.</t5051> <t5052>I had just put Lacey to sleep at 9 PM, in the same position in the back seat.</t5052> <t5053>We would wake Lacey up at 2 AM.</t5053> <t5054>The plan was for each of us to get some sleep so that in the morning we wouldn't have to use our hands to prop our eyelids open as we entered Agloe.</t5054>
<t5055>The minivan has become a small home: I am sitting in the passenger seat, this is the relaxation room.</t5055> <t5056>I think this is the best room in the house: very spacious, the seat is quite comfortable.</t5056>
<t5057>Scattered on the carpet under the front seat next to the driver were the office, a map of the U.S. bought at a BP station, the directions I had printed out, and the scratch paper on which Radar had scribbled calculations about speed and distance.</t5057>
<t5058>Radar sat in the driver's seat.</t5058> <t5059>The living room.</t5059> <t5060>Quite similar to a relaxation room, except that sitting there, one cannot relax.</t5060> <t5061>And the living room is cleaner.</t5061>
<t5062>Between the living room and the relaxation room, we have a central control unit, or the kitchen.</t5062> <t5063>Here, we store a lot of essentials like beef jerky, GoFast bars, and the miraculous energy drink Bluefin that Lacey added to the shopping list.</t5063> <t5064>Bluefin is packaged in small, curvy glass bottles, with a taste reminiscent of blue cotton candy.</t5064> <t5065>It also makes you more alert than anything in human history, though it does leave you feeling a bit jittery afterward.</t5065> <t5066>Radar and I agreed to keep drinking it until two hours before our shift break.</t5066> <t5067>My shift starts at midnight, when Ben wakes up.</t5067>
<t5068>The first row of benches is bedroom number one.</t5068> <t5069>It's not a very desirable bedroom because it's near the kitchen and living room, where people are awake, talking, and occasionally there's music on the radio.</t5069>
<t5070>Behind that is the second bedroom, darker, quieter, and overall more luxurious than the first bedroom.</t5070>
<t5071>And finally, the refrigerator, which is the cold storage box, currently contains 210 bottles of beer that Ben hasn't peed in, turkey-bacon-lookalike sandwiches, and some Coke.</t5071>
<t5072>There are many more advantages to this house.</t5072> <t5073>The entire floor is carpeted.</t5073> <t5074>There is a central air conditioning system with both heating and cooling functions.</t5074> <t5075>It is equipped with a surround sound speaker system.</t5075> <t5076>Admittedly, there is only a little over five square meters of living space.</t5076> <t5077>And you can't arrange everything on an open floor plan.</t5077>
<t5078>The eighth hour</t5078>
<t5079>As soon as we arrived in South Carolina, I noticed Radar yawning, so I insisted on driving.</t5079> <t5080>Anyway, I like driving–this car is just a minivan, but it's my minivan.</t5080> <t5081>Radar slipped out of the driver's seat to bedroom number one, while I quickly grabbed the wheel, held it firmly, and swiftly moved from the kitchen to the driver's seat.</t5081>
<t5082>I'm gradually realizing that only by traveling can I understand many things about myself.</t5082> <t5083>For instance, I never thought I was the kind of person who could pee into an almost empty Bluefin energy drink bottle while driving through South Carolina at seventy-seven miles per hour–but in reality, I am that kind of person.</t5083> <t5084>Moreover, I never realized that if you mix a fair amount of urine with a bit of Bluefin energy drink, the result would be a strangely bright turquoise color.</t5084> <t5085>The color was so beautiful that I wanted to cap the bottle and place it in the cup holder for Lacey and Ben to see when they woke up.</t5085>
<t5086>But Radar had a different feeling.</t5086> <t5087>"If you don't throw that crap out the window right now, I will end our eleven-year friendship," it said.</t5087>
<t5088>"I didn't poop," I tried to argue.</t5088> <t5089>"I just peed."</t5089>
<t5090>"Get out now," Radar said unemotionally.</t5090> <t5091>I had no choice but to throw it away. Through the side mirror, I saw the bottle hit the asphalt, shattering like a water balloon.</t5091> <t5092>Radar also glanced over.</t5092>
<t5093>“Oh, dear Lord,” it said.</t5093> <t5094>“I hope that it is just one of those terrible, nerve-wracking experiences that I will forget as soon as it happens.”</t5094>
<t5095>Ninth hour</t5095>
<t5096>I never thought that I could get tired of GoFast nutrition bars.</t5096> <t5097>But it turns out I can.</t5097> <t5098>After just two bites of the fourth bar of the day, my stomach started to churn.</t5098> <t5099>I opened the drawer in front of me and put it back in.</t5099> <t5100>We called that place the kitchen cabinet.</t5100>
<t5101>"A few apples would be nice," Radar said.</t5101> <t5102>"Oh, would it be good to eat apples now?"</t5102>
<t5103>I sighed.</t5103> <t5104>Confusedly mistaking the fourth food group.</t5104> <t5105>Moreover, even though I haven't had Bluefin for hours, I still feel terribly restless.</t5105>
<t5106>"I feel so restless, you know," I said.</t5106>
<t5107>"Yeah," Radar replied. "I can't stop tapping my fingers." I looked down.</t5107> <t5108>Radar was silently tapping his fingers on his knee.</t5108> <t5109>"I really can't stop."</t5109><t5110></t5110>
<t5111>“Alright, fine, I'm not tired. Let's stay up until four o'clock, wake the other two up, and then we'll sleep until eight o'clock.</t5111><t5112>”</t5112>
<t5113>“Agreed,” she replied.</t5113> <t5114>A pause.</t5114> <t5115>Now the road was empty, only us and the pickup trucks.</t5115> <t5116>I felt like my brain was processing information eleven thousand times faster than normal.</t5116> <t5117>It turned out that what I was doing was very simple, driving on the interstate was the simplest and most pleasant thing in the world: all I had to do was stay in my lane, make sure no one got too close to me and I didn't get too close to anyone, and keep going.</t5117> <t5118>Perhaps she felt the same way, but I could never feel like this if I were alone.</t5118>
<t5119>Radar breaks the silence.</t5119> <t5120>"Hey, if you only sleep at four..."</t5120>
<t5121>I finished my sentence. "Alright, let's just open another bottle of Bluefin."</t5121>
<t5122>And we did so.</t5122>
<t5123>The tenth hour</t5123>
<t5124>It's time to stop for the second time.</t5124> <t5125>It is 12:13 AM.</t5125> <t5126>My fingers no longer feel like fingers, but as if they are made of motion.</t5126> <t5127>I continuously rub my fingers on the steering wheel while driving.</t5127>
<t5128>After Radar identified the nearest BP station on the handheld computer, we decided to wake up Lacey and Ben.</t5128>
<t5129>I called, "Hey guys, we're about to stop."</t5129> <t5130>There was no reaction.</t5130>
<t5131>Radar turned and placed a hand on Lacey's shoulder.</t5131> <t5132>"Lacey, wake up." No movement.</t5132>
<t5133>I turned on the radio and found an old-fashioned station.</t5133> <t5134>The Beatles band.</t5134> <t5135>The song “Good Morning.” I turned up the volume.</t5135> <t5136>No reaction.</t5136> <t5137>Radar then turned it up even more.</t5137> <t5138>More and more.</t5138> <t5139>By the chorus, it started singing along.</t5139> <t5140>I joined in too, and eventually, my off-key booming voice probably woke the two of them up.</t5140>
<t5141>"TURN IT OFF NOW!" Ben shouted loudly.</t5141> <t5142>We turned the music down. "Ben, it's almost stopping.</t5142> <t5143>Do you want to get off to pee?"</t5143>
<t5144>It didn't say anything, there was a rustling sound in that dark corner.</t5144> <t5145>Who knows what physical strategy the monkey was using to measure the swelling of its bladder.</t5145> <t5146>“I don't need it, really,” it replied.</t5146>
<t5147>“Alright, then we will go down to buy gasoline.</t5147><t5148>”</t5148>
<t5149>“As the only guy who hasn't peed in this car, I'll go to the bathroom first,” Radar said.</t5149>
<t5150>"Shh...," Lacey mumbled.</t5150> <t5151>"Shh... everyone, stop talking."</t5151>
<t5152>"Lacey, you have to get up and go to the bathroom," Radar said.</t5152> <t5153>"We are about to stop."</t5153>
<t5154>“Let you go in and buy apples,” I told Lacey.</t5154>
<t5155>“Apple,” Lacey innocently chirped in the voice of an adorable little girl. “I love apples so much.”</t5155>
<t5156>"Then it's your turn to drive," Radar said.</t5156> <t5157>"So you really have to wake up."</t5157>
<t5158>Lacey sat up, speaking in a normal tone, "I don't like it much either."</t5158>
<t5159>We turned off at the exit, 0.9 miles from the BP station, thinking it was close, but Radar said it would take about four minutes.</t5159> <t5160>South Carolina traffic was surrounding us.</t5160> <t5161>So the construction ahead, still about an hour away, could become a very serious problem.</t5161> <t5162>But I wasn't allowed to worry.</t5162> <t5163>Lacey and Ben had already woken up from their deep sleep, both ready at the car door.</t5163> <t5164>Just like before, as soon as we stopped at the gas station, everyone jumped out of the car, I tossed the keys to Ben, and he caught them mid-air.</t5164>
<t5165>When Radar and I were running as fast as we could past a white employee standing behind the checkout counter, seeing him staring, Radar stopped and said without any embarrassment, "Yes, I'm wearing a NO HATE HERITAGE shirt over my graduation gown.</t5165> <t5166>By the way, do you sell pants?"</t5166>
<t5167>That guy looked like he was about to be speechless, "There are some camouflage pants near the machine oil."</t5167>
<t5168>“So happy,” Radar replied, then turned to me and continued, “Be a good friend and go get me some pants.</t5168> <t5169>If possible, which t-shirt looks better?”</t5169>
<t5170>“Alright, alright,” I replied.</t5170> <t5171>Camouflage pants, it turned out, were not numbered as usual.</t5171> <t5172>There were only medium and large sizes.</t5172> <t5173>I picked a pair of medium pants, and an oversized pink T-shirt with the words THE NICEST GRANDMA ON EARTH.</t5173> <t5174>I also grabbed three bottles of Bluefin.</t5174>
<t5175>I handed everything to Lacey when she came out of the restroom.</t5175> <t5176>I went straight into the women's restroom because Radar was still in the men's.</t5176> <t5177>I don't think I've ever been in a women's restroom at a gas station.</t5177>
<t5178>Other points:</t5178>
<t5179>There is no condom vending machine</t5179>
<t5180>Less graffiti</t5180>
<t5181>No urinals</t5181>
<t5182>The smell is quite similar, which makes me a bit disappointed.</t5182>
<t5183>When I came out, Lacey was paying and Ben was honking the horn.</t5183> <t5184>For a split second, I didn't understand anything, then I dashed to the car.</t5184>
<t5185>"We lost a minute," Ben said from the passenger seat.</t5185> <t5186>Lacey was turning the car onto a side road to get back to the highway.</t5186>
<t5187>“Sorry,” Radar replied from behind, he was sitting next to me, fumbling to put on pants under his robe.</t5187> <t5188>“On the bright side, I have pants.</t5188> <t5189>And a new shirt.</t5189> <t5190>Where's the shirt, Q?” Lacey handed it to him. “Weird.”</t5190> <t5191>He took off the robe and put on the grandma's T-shirt while Ben grumbled about why no one bought him pants.</t5191> <t5192>He said it was because his butt itched.</t5192> <t5193>And upon reflection, he kind of needed to pee now.</t5193>
<t5194>The eleventh hour</t5194>
<t5195>We reached the construction site.</t5195> <t5196>The highway narrowed to a single lane.</t5196> <t5197>We were stuck behind a large cargo truck moving at the exact speed limit of thirty-five miles per hour.</t5197> <t5198>Lacey driving at this moment was very sensible; if it were me, I would probably be pounding on the steering wheel, but Lacey just smiled and chatted with Ben until she turned to me and said, "Q, I need to use the restroom, we’re wasting time behind this truck anyway."</t5198>
<t5199>I just nodded.</t5199> <t5200>Can't blame Lacey.</t5200> <t5201>If I couldn't pee into a bottle, I would have made everyone stop a long time ago.</t5201> <t5202>It's pretty brave of Lacey to hold it in as much as she did.</t5202>
<t5203>Lacey pulled the car into an all-night gas station, and I got out to stretch my legs, now feeling like rubber.</t5203> <t5204>When Lacey returned, I was sitting in the driver's seat.</t5204> <t5205>I really didn't know how I ended up in the driver's seat, why I was sitting there instead of Lacey.</t5205> <t5206>At the car door, Lacey saw that I was settled in, with the window open.</t5206> <t5207>I said to Lacey, "Let me drive." It was my car, and ultimately, my mission.</t5207> <t5208>Lacey asked, "Really?</t5208> <t5209>Are you sure?" and I replied, "Yeah, yeah, I'm totally fine," so Lacey slid the door open and lay down in the back seat.</t5209>
<t5210>The twelfth hour</t5210>
<t5211>It is 2:40 AM.</t5211> <t5212>Lacey is sleeping.</t5212> <t5213>Radar is sleeping.</t5213> <t5214>I am driving.</t5214> <t5215>The road is completely empty.</t5215> <t5216>Even most of the truck drivers have gone to sleep.</t5216> <t5217>We go for minutes without seeing any headlights from the opposite direction.</t5217> <t5218>Ben chats to keep me from getting sleepy.</t5218> <t5219>We talk about Margo.</t5219>
<t5220>"Have you thought about how we are actually going to find Agloe?" he asked.</t5220>
<t5221>"Yes, I guess it's at the intersection of the two roads," I said.</t5221> <t5222>"And there's nothing but a crossroads.</t5222><t5223>"</t5223>
<t5224>“And Margo was sitting there on his truck, resting her chin on her hand waiting for him, right?”</t5224>
<t5225>"Sounds good," I replied.</t5225>
<t5226>"Buddy, I'm a bit worried. If things don't go as you think, you'll be very disappointed."</t5226><t5227></t5227>
<t5228>“I just want to find Margo,” I replied, because that was true.</t5228> <t5229>I want her to be safe, alive, found.</t5229> <t5230>Following the thread to the end.</t5230> <t5231>The rest is secondary.</t5231>
<t5232>“Yeah, but—I don't know,” Ben said.</t5232> <t5233>“It's just—remember that sometimes your thoughts about someone don't match who they really are.</t5233> <t5234>For example, I used to always think Lacey was hot and amazing, but now actually being around her... it's not exactly like that.</t5234> <t5235>People become very different when you can smell them and see them up close, you know?”</t5235>
<t5236>“I know,” I replied.</t5236> <t5237>I know how long I've been mistaken about Margo, how distorted my perception was.</t5237>
<t5238>“What I mean is that it used to be very easy for me to like Lacey.</t5238> <t5239>Liking someone from afar is always very easy.</t5239> <t5240>But when she was no longer a distant wonder, and started to become, well, an ordinary girl with weird eating habits, occasionally acting like a bully–basically, I had to start liking a completely different person.</t5240><t5241>”</t5241>
<t5242>I felt my cheeks heating up.</t5242> <t5243>“Are you telling me I don't really like Margo?</t5243> <t5244>After all this–I've been in this car for twelve hours and you're saying I don't care about Margo because I don't–” I paused.</t5244> <t5245>“You think just because you have a girlfriend now, you can stand on a high horse and lecture me?</t5245> <t5246>You really are–”</t5246>
<t5247>I stopped speaking because I saw ahead, outside the beam of the headlights, something that was about to ruin everything for me.</t5247>
<t5248>Two cows stood innocently in the middle of the highway.</t5248> <t5249>In a flash, we saw them: the spotted one in the left lane, and in our lane, a gigantic creature, as wide as the car, standing motionless.</t5249> <t5250>It turned its head and calmly looked at us with indifferent eyes.</t5250> <t5251>The cow was completely white without a single spot, a white wall of a cow that couldn't be jumped over, crawled under, or circled around.</t5251> <t5252>The only option was to crash into it.</t5252> <t5253>I knew Ben had seen it too, because I heard Ben's breath stop abruptly.</t5253>
<t5254>They say that life flashes before your eyes, but for me, it wasn't like that.</t5254> <t5255>Nothing flashed before my eyes except this vast, impossibly white expanse, now just seconds away from us.</t5255> <t5256>I didn't know what to do.</t5256> <t5257>No, that wasn't the issue.</t5257> <t5258>The issue was that there was nothing to do except crash into that white wall, destroying it and us, both sides.</t5258> <t5259>I slammed on the brakes, out of habit rather than hoping to change the outcome: it was clearly unavoidable.</t5259> <t5260>I raised my hands off the steering wheel.</t5260> <t5261>I didn't know why I did it, but I raised my hands, as if surrendering.</t5261> <t5262>I thought about the most mundane thing in the world: that I didn't want this to happen.</t5262> <t5263>I didn't want to die.</t5263> <t5264>I didn't want my friends to die.</t5264> <t5265>And honestly, as time slowed down and my hands were in the air, I had the chance for one more thought, and I thought of her.</t5265> <t5266>I blamed her for this deadly, ridiculous chase—for putting us at risk, for turning me into a fool driving like a maniac all night.</t5266> <t5267>If it weren't for her, I wouldn't be dying.</t5267> <t5268>I would have been at home, because I always stayed home, I would have been safe, and I would have been doing what I always wanted to do, which was to grow up.</t5268>
<t5269>Having surrendered control of the car, I was surprised to see a hand on the steering wheel.</t5269> <t5270>We turned before I realized why we were turning, and saw Ben pulling the steering wheel towards him, twisting it in a desperate attempt to avoid the cow.</t5270> <t5271>We skidded onto the shoulder and then onto the grass.</t5271> <t5272>I heard the tires screeching as Ben jerked the wheel in the opposite direction.</t5272> <t5273>I stopped looking.</t5273> <t5274>I didn't know if it was because my eyes were closed, or because my eyes could no longer see anything.</t5274> <t5275>My stomach and lungs collided in my chest.</t5275> <t5276>Something sharp cut across my cheek.</t5276> <t5277>We came to a stop.</t5277>
<t5278>I don't know why, but I raised my hand to my face.</t5278> <t5279>Turning my hand over, I saw a streak of blood.</t5279> <t5280>I felt both my arms, hugged myself, but I was just checking if I still had both arms, turns out I did. I looked down at my legs.</t5280> <t5281>Still there.</t5281> <t5282>There were some pieces of glass.</t5282> <t5283>I looked around.</t5283> <t5284>The bottles were broken.</t5284> <t5285>Ben was looking at me.</t5285> <t5286>Ben was touching his face.</t5286> <t5287>He looked fine.</t5287> <t5288>He also hugged himself like I did.</t5288> <t5289>His body was still functioning.</t5289> <t5290>He just looked at me.</t5290> <t5291>Through the rearview mirror, I saw the cow.</t5291> <t5292>And now, belatedly, Ben screamed.</t5292> <t5293>He stared at me and screamed, his mouth wide open, the scream deep and terrifying.</t5293> <t5294>He stopped screaming.</t5294> <t5295>Something was wrong with me.</t5295> <t5296>I felt like I was fainting.</t5296> <t5297>My chest was burning.</t5297> <t5298>Then I gasped for air.</t5298> <t5299>I had forgotten to breathe. I hadn't been breathing that whole time.</t5299> <t5300>I felt better when I could breathe again.</t5300> <t5301>Inhale through the nose, exhale through the mouth.</t5301>
<t5302>“Is anyone hurt?” Lacey shouted.</t5302> <t5303>He scrambled out of his spot and stumbled backward.</t5303> <t5304>I turned around, saw the back door of the car was open, and for a moment I thought Radar had been thrown out, but he sat up.</t5304> <t5305>He wiped his face and said, “I’m okay, I’m okay.</t5305> <t5306>Is everyone else alright?”</t5306>
<t5307>Lacey didn't respond; she jumped forward, between me and Ben. Lacey bent down in the kitchen of the apartment, looking at Ben and asked, "Where does it hurt, honey?" Lacey's eyes were brimming with tears like a swimming pool on a rainy day.</t5307> <t5308>And Ben replied, "It'sokit'sokQyou'rebleeding." </t5308>
<t5309>Lacey turned to me.</t5309> <t5310>I shouldn't have cried but I did.</t5310> <t5311>It wasn't because of the pain, but because I was scared, I raised my hand, Ben saved us, and now this girl was looking at me, like the way my mother used to, and that shouldn't have broken me, but it did.</t5311> <t5312>I knew the scratch on my face was nothing, and I tried to say that, but I kept crying.</t5312> <t5313>Lacey pressed on the scratch with her slender, soft fingers, telling Ben to find something to bandage it.</t5313> <t5314>And then a strip of the Union flag was pressed against my right cheek, near my nose.</t5314> <t5315>Lacey said, "Just hold it tight, it'll be okay, are you hurt anywhere else?" and I said no.</t5315> <t5316>At that moment I realized the car engine was still running, the engine was still on, the car had stopped only because I was still pressing the brake.</t5316> <t5317>I shifted to park and turned off the engine.</t5317> <t5318>Only then did I hear the sound of liquid flowing—not dripping but gushing.</t5318>
<t5319>“We should go outside immediately,” Radar said.</t5319> <t5320>I held the Confederate flag strip on my face.</t5320> <t5321>The sound of liquid flowing from the car had not yet ceased.</t5321>
<t5322>“That's gasoline!”</t5322> <t5323>“It's probably going to explode!” Ben shouted.</t5323> <t5324>He immediately opened the front door and rushed out, running away in panic.</t5324> <t5325>He jumped over a wooden fence and dashed through the dry meadow.</t5325> <t5326>I also went out but not in such a hurry.</t5326> <t5327>Radar also went outside, and while Ben was still running frantically, Radar burst out laughing, “It's beer,” he said.</t5327>
<t5328>"What?"</t5328>
<t5329>"The kegs are all broken," it repeated, nodding towards the open cooler, gallons of foamy white liquid spilling out.</t5329>
<t5330>We tried to call Ben, but he couldn't hear us because he was busy shouting, "IT'S GOING TO EXPLODE!" and was still running across the field.</t5330> <t5331>His robe fluttered in the pale dawn light, exposing his bony, pointed buttocks.</t5331>
<t5332>I turned back to look at the highway when I heard the sound of a car approaching.</t5332> <t5333>The pure white girl and her spotted friend were leisurely in the safe zone on the opposite shoulder, still clearly carefree and untroubled.</t5333> <t5334>Turning back, I saw the minivan crashing into the fence.</t5334>
<t5335>I was assessing the damage when Ben finally huffed and puffed his way back.</t5335> <t5336>When we made a sharp turn, we must have hit the fence because there was a deep dent on the sliding door, so deep that if you looked closely, you could see inside the car.</t5336> <t5337>Other than that, the car was still in good shape.</t5337> <t5338>There were no more dents.</t5338> <t5339>No windows were broken.</t5339> <t5340>No tires were flat.</t5340> <t5341>I went around to the back, closed the tailgate, and stood looking at the 210 broken beer bottles still foaming.</t5341> <t5342>Lacey saw and wrapped an arm around me.</t5342> <t5343>We both watched the white foam slither down the drainage ditch below.</t5343> <t5344>“What happened?” Lacey asked.</t5344>
<t5345>I said: we were all about to crash, but Ben managed to steer just in time, making the car turn sharply like a ballet dancer.</t5345>
<t5346>Ben and Radar crawled under the car.</t5346> <t5347>Both of them were clueless about cars, but crawling under probably made them feel better.</t5347> <t5348>The hem of Ben's robe and his legs stuck out.</t5348> <t5349>"Looks good, guys," Radar said loudly.</t5349>
<t5350>“The car spun about eight times, Radar,” I said,</t5350>
<t5351>"It's probably not going to be okay."</t5351>
<t5352>"Looks fine," Radar replied.</t5352>
<t5353>“Hey,” I called, grabbing the New Balance shoes on Ben's feet. “Hey, come here.”</t5353> <t5354>He scooted out, and I extended my hand to help him up.</t5354> <t5355>His hands were pitch black with grime from the car.</t5355> <t5356>I put my arm around his shoulder.</t5356> <t5357>If I hadn't surrendered the wheel, and if he hadn't acted in time, I would have been a goner for sure.</t5357> <t5358>“Thanks, man,” I said, patting him on the back, probably a bit too hard.</t5358> <t5359>“In my entire life, I've never seen such an impressive steering maneuver from the passenger seat.”</t5359>
<t5360>Ben wiped his greasy, oil-stained hand on my uninjured cheek.</t5360> <t5361>"I did it to save myself, not you," he said.</t5361> <t5362>"Believe me, at that moment, you didn't cross my mind at all.</t5362><t5363>"</t5363>
<t5364>I burst out laughing.</t5364> <t5365>"I didn't think about you either," I said.</t5365>
<t5366>Ben looked at me, the corners of his mouth twitching, then he said, "Yeah, that cow is huge."</t5366> <t5367>"It must not be a cow but a walking whale." I burst out laughing.</t5367>
<t5368>Radar poked out.</t5368> <t5369>"Dear friends, I really think it's fine.</t5369> <t5370>We only lost about five minutes.</t5370> <t5371>Just keep going, no need to speed up."</t5371>
<t5372>Lacey was biting her lip, looking at the hole in the car. "What do you think?" I asked Lacey.</t5372>
<t5373>"Let's go," Lacey replied.</t5373>
<t5374>"Let's go," Radar voted.</t5374>
<t5375>Ben sighed heavily.</t5375> <t5376>“Mostly because I'm used to pressure from my teammates: let's go.”</t5376>
<t5377>"Let's go," I said.</t5377> <t5378>"But I'm definitely not driving anymore."</t5378>
<t5379>Ben received the keys from my hand.</t5379> <t5380>We got into the car.</t5380> <t5381>Radar directed us up a slightly sloping embankment, then we got back on the interstate highway.</t5381> <t5382>We were 542 miles away from Agloe.</t5382>
<t5383>The Thirteenth Hour</t5383>
<t5384>Every few minutes, Radar would say, "Do you guys remember back then when we were all about to die and there was Ben, so talented, shooting through the big cow, making it spin like a teacup ride at Disney World, saving us from being smashed to pieces."</t5384>
<t5385>Lacey leaned over the kitchen, placed her hand on Ben's knee, and said, "I want to tell you that you are a hero, don't you know that?</t5385> <t5386>People award medals for such feats."</t5386>
<t5387>"I already said it and I'll say it again: I can't think of anyone else."</t5387> <t5388>"I. Want."</t5388> <t5389>"To. Save. My."</t5389> <t5390>"Own."</t5390> <t5391>"Ass."</t5391>
<t5392>"Nonsense."</t5392> <t5393>"You are a lovable liar with heroic qualities," Lacey said and gave it a big kiss on the cheek.</t5393>
<t5394>Radar continued, "Do you guys remember that time when I was sleeping in the back seat and talking in my sleep, and the car door suddenly opened and beer poured all over me, but I felt completely fine? I don't remember how it happened, it's so miraculous!"</t5394>
<t5395>"Let's play the Metaphysical I Spy game," Lacey suggested. "I spy with my little eye a heroic heart, a heart that beats not for itself but for all of humanity."</t5395><t5396></t5396>
<t5397>“WHO CARES ABOUT HUMILITY. I JUST DON'T WANT TO DIE,” Ben shouted.</t5397>
<t5398>"Do you remember back then on that tiny car twenty minutes ago when we didn't end up dead?"</t5398><t5399></t5399>
<t5400>The fourteenth hour</t5400>
<t5401>Coming back to our senses, we started cleaning up.</t5401> <t5402>The whole group tried to gather all the broken Bluefin bottle pieces into paper, putting them all into a bag to throw away later.</t5402> <t5403>The car floor mat was soaked with Mountain Dew, Bluefin, and sticky Coke, and we tried to absorb it with paper towels.</t5403> <t5404>We definitely needed to wash the car thoroughly, but there was no time for that before reaching Agloe.</t5404> <t5405>Radar had looked up the cost to replace the sliding door: $300 plus painting.</t5405> <t5406>The trip expenses were slowly adding up, but I would work at my dad's office this summer to make up for it; after all, it was a small ransom to pay for Margo.</t5406>
<t5407>The sun rose on the right.</t5407> <t5408>My cheek was still bleeding. The Confederate flag had stuck to the wound, so I didn't have to hold it tightly anymore.</t5408>
<t5409>Fifteenth hour</t5409>
<t5410>A sparse line of oaks stood on the edge of cornfields stretching endlessly to the horizon.</t5410> <t5411>The scenery changed, but nothing else did.</t5411> <t5412>Interstate highways like this one made the countryside feel like just one place: McDonald’s, BP, Wendy’s.</t5412> <t5413>I know I probably hated the interstates and longed for the leisurely days of old, where every turn was steeped in familiar urban hues—but never mind.</t5413> <t5414>I like it this way.</t5414> <t5415>I like the continuity.</t5415> <t5416>I like that I can drive away from home for fifteen hours straight and the world doesn’t change too much.</t5416> <t5417>Lacey strapped me in the back seat with both seat belts.</t5417> <t5418>“You need to rest,” Lacey said.</t5418> <t5419>“You’ve been through a lot.” Surprisingly, no one blamed me for being so sluggish in the battle with the cow.</t5419>
<t5420>Lying quietly, I could hear my friends teasing each other and laughing – not the exact words, but the intonation, the highs and lows in their stories.</t5420> <t5421>I liked just listening, just peacefully lying on the grass.</t5421> <t5422>And I decided that if we arrived on time and didn’t see Margo, the next thing we would do was: drive around Catskill, find a spot to sit aimlessly, peacefully on the grass, talk, and joke with each other.</t5422> <t5423>Maybe just knowing for sure that Margo was alive would make everything possible again – even though I never actually saw any evidence of that.</t5423> <t5424>I could almost imagine being happy without her, being able to let her go, feeling our roots intertwined, even though I might never see that patch of grass again.</t5424>
<t5425>The sixteenth hour</t5425>
<t5426>I sleep.</t5426>
<t5427>Seventeenth hour</t5427>
<t5428>I sleep.</t5428>
<t5429>The eighteenth hour</t5429>
<t5430>I sleep.</t5430>
<t5431>Nineteenth hour</t5431>
<t5432>When I woke up, Ben and Radar were having a heated debate about the name of the car.</t5432> <t5433>Ben wanted to name it Muhammad Ali because, like Muhammad Ali, this minivan could take a hit and keep on going.</t5433> <t5434>Radar said you can't name a car after a historical figure.</t5434> <t5435>He thought it should be named Lurlene, because it sounded nice.</t5435>
<t5436>“Do you really want to name it Lurlene?” Ben asked, his voice rising in apparent fear.</t5436> <t5437>“Hasn't this poor car suffered enough?”</t5437>
<t5438>I unfastened my seatbelt and sat up.</t5438> <t5439>Lacey turned to me. "Good morning," Lacey said.</t5439> <t5440>"Welcome to the great state of New York.</t5440><t5441>"</t5441>
<t5442>"What time is it?"</t5442>
<t5443>"Nine forty-two." Lacey's hair was tied up, but some shorter strands had fallen out. "How do you feel?" Lacey asked.</t5443>
<t5444>I replied, "Scared."</t5444>
<t5445>Lacey looked at me, smiled, and nodded. "Yeah, me too.</t5445> <t5446>It's as if too many things can happen to be ready for all of this."</t5446>
<t5447>"Yes," I replied.</t5447>
<t5448>"I hope we will still be friends this summer," Lacey said.</t5448> <t5449>Somehow, hearing that made me feel better.</t5449> <t5450>We can never tell what will make us feel better.</t5450>
<t5451>Radar is saying that this car should be named Gray Goose. I leaned forward a bit so everyone could hear and said, "The Top. The harder you throw it, the faster it spins.</t5451><t5452>"</t5452>
<t5453>Ben nodded.</t5453> <t5454>Radar turned back.</t5454> <t5455>"I think you should be the object identification expert."</t5455>
<t5456>The twentieth hour</t5456>
<t5457>I'm sitting in bedroom number one with Lacey.</t5457> <t5458>Ben is driving.</t5458> <t5459>Radar is navigating.</t5459> <t5460>I was still asleep when we made our last stop, but the others had bought a map of New York.</t5460> <t5461>Agloe wasn't on the map, but there were only about five or six intersections north of Roscoe.</t5461> <t5462>I still thought of New York as a bustling metropolis, but at the moment there were only rolling, densely wooded hills that the minivan had to bravely climb.</t5462> <t5463>For a while, no one said anything, then Ben reached out to turn on the radio, and I said, "Let's play Metaphysical I Spy!"</t5463>
<t5464>Ben started. "I Spy with my little eye, something that I really like."</t5464>
<t5465>“Oh, I know,” Radar replied. “The taste of beer.”</t5465>
<t5466>"No."</t5466>
<t5467>"The taste of different types of newspapers, right?" I guessed.</t5467>
<t5468>"No, that's worse!" Ben replied.</t5468>
<t5469>“Hmm,” Radar continued.</t5469> <t5470>“Or is it the smell of balls?”</t5470>
<t5471>"The feeling of the surface of the marble?" I guessed further.</t5471>
<t5472>"Stop it, you pervert, it has nothing to do with the male urinary organ."</t5472> <t5473>"What do you guess, Lace?"</t5473>
<t5474>"Yes, is it the feeling of knowing that you just saved three lives?"</t5474>
<t5475>"No, all reasoning is exhausted."</t5475>
<t5476>“Alright, so what is it?”</t5476>
<t5477>"It's Lacey," Ben replied, and I saw him watching her through the rearview mirror.</t5477>
<t5478>“Off-topic,” I said, “we're playing the metaphysical version of I Spy.</t5478> <t5479>It has to be something that can't be seen with the naked eye.</t5479><t5480>”</t5480>
<t5481>“That's it,” Ben argued.</t5481> <t5482>“That's exactly what I like – Lacey, but not the Lacey you can see with the naked eye.</t5482><t5483>”</t5483>
<t5484>"Oh, I feel like throwing up," Radar groaned, but Lacey unbuckled her seatbelt, leaned over the seat, and whispered something into Ben's ear. His face immediately turned bright red.</t5484>
<t5485>“Alright, I promise I won't be a cheese ball,” Radar said.</t5485> <t5486>“I Spy with my little eye, something we are all feeling.”</t5486>
<t5487>I immediately guessed, "Exhausted and out of breath?"</t5487>
<t5488>“No, but good guess.”</t5488>
<t5489>Lacey said, "Isn't it a weird feeling to have too much caffeine in your system?</t5489> <t5490>Like your heart beating is nothing compared to your whole body pulsing?"</t5490>
<t5491>"No."</t5491> <t5492>"What do you guess, Ben?"</t5492>
<t5493>“Um, do we all need to pee, or is it just me?”</t5493>
<t5494>"As usual, it's just you."</t5494> <t5495>"Is there anyone else guessing?" We were all silent.</t5495> <t5496>"The correct answer is that we will feel happier after singing 'Swelling Under the Sun' together without any accompaniment."</t5496>
<t5497>And it was indeed so.</t5497> <t5498>Even though I might have tone-deafness, I still sang out loud like the others.</t5498> <t5499>After finishing the song, I said, "I Spy with my little eye, something really interesting."</t5499>
<t5500>For a moment, no one said anything.</t5500> <t5501>Only the sound of the Spinner continuously devouring the asphalt as it descended the slope.</t5501> <t5502>After a while, Ben said,</t5502>
<t5503>“Is it this matter?” I nodded.</t5503>
<t5504>"Yeah," Radar said.</t5504> <t5505>"As long as we don't die, this is truly a groundbreaking event."</t5505>
<t5506>If we find her, that would be great, I thought, but said nothing.</t5506> <t5507>Finally, Ben turned on the radio, found a rock music station with ballads that we could sing along to.</t5507>
<t5508>The twenty-first hour</t5508>
<t5509>After more than 1,100 miles on the interstate highway, it was finally time to get off.</t5509> <t5510>It was completely impossible to drive at seventy-seven miles per hour on a two-lane highway and continue heading north, against the Catskill Mountains.</t5510> <t5511>But we would be fine.</t5511> <t5512>Radar, an excellent strategist, had calculated a thirty-minute reserve without letting us know.</t5512> <t5513>This place was beautiful, with the near-noon sunlight pouring down on the ancient forest.</t5513> <t5514>The brick houses in the desolate residential area below also sparkled in this sunlight as we passed by.</t5514>
<t5515>Lacey and I told Ben and Radar everything we could remember to help them find Margo more easily.</t5515> <t5516>Reminding the guys about Margo. Reminding ourselves about Margo.</t5516> <t5517>Her silver Honda Civic.</t5517> <t5518>Her light chestnut brown hair, straight and smooth.</t5518>
<t5519>Her interest in abandoned houses.</t5519>
<t5520>“Margo also has a black notebook,” I said.</t5520>
<t5521>Ben turned to me.</t5521> <t5522>“Alright, if I see any girl who looks like Margo in Agloe, New York, I won't do anything.</t5522> <t5523>Unless she has a notebook.</t5523> <t5524>That's the identifying feature.</t5524><t5525>”</t5525>
<t5526>I nudged Ben. I just wanted to remember her.</t5526> <t5527>One last time, I wanted to remember Margo while still hoping to see her again.</t5527>
<t5528>Agloe</t5528>
<t5529>The speed gradually decreased from fifty-five to forty-five, then thirty-five miles per hour.</t5529> <t5530>After a few railroad crossings, we arrived at Roscoe.</t5530> <t5531>We slowly drove through the sleepy downtown area with a café, a clothing store, a dollar store, and several storefronts with entirely boarded-up windows.</t5531>
<t5532>I lean forward and say, "I can imagine Margo being in there."</t5532>
<t5533>"Yeah," Ben agreed.</t5533> <t5534>"Gosh, I don't want to break into those buildings at all.</t5534> <t5535>I probably wouldn't survive New York prison."</t5535>
<t5536>But the idea of exploring those houses did not particularly scare me, because the whole place seemed abandoned.</t5536> <t5537>No shops were open.</t5537> <t5538>Through the town center, there was a single street that cut through the highway.</t5538> <t5539>On that street was a solitary residential area and Roscoe Elementary School.</t5539> <t5540>The modest wooden houses were like dwarfs hiding under the tall trees with dense foliage.</t5540>
<t5541>We turned onto another highway, accelerating as fast as before, but in reality, Radar was driving slowly.</t5541> <t5542>We hadn't gone a mile when we saw a dirt road on the left, with no signs at all.</t5542>
<t5543>“This could be the place,” I said.</t5543>
<t5544>“It's just a road for cars,” Ben said, but Radar still turned in.</t5544> <t5545>In fact, it really did look like a road for cars, a strip of road running on solid ground.</t5545> <t5546>To our left, weeds grew as high as the car wheels; I couldn't see anything, but I was a bit worried that if someone wanted to hide in this field, it wouldn't be too difficult.</t5546> <t5547>We drove a bit further and the strip of road led to a Victorian-style farmhouse.</t5547> <t5548>We circled around back, turned back onto the two-lane highway, and continued north.</t5548> <t5549>The highway turned onto Cat Hollow Road, and we drove until we saw a strip of dirt road similar to the one earlier, this time on the right, leading to what looked like a dilapidated wooden barn.</t5549> <t5550>Rows of cylindrical hay bales lay in the fields on both sides of us, and the grass in the fields had started to grow back.</t5550> <t5551>Radar was driving at less than five miles per hour.</t5551> <t5552>We were looking for any signs of irregularity.</t5552> <t5553>A slight crack in this perfectly picturesque landscape.</t5553>
<t5554>"Do people think it could be the Agloe General Store?"</t5554>
<t5555>"That warehouse?"</t5555>
<t5556>“Yes.”</t5556>
<t5557>“I don't know,” Radar replied. “Has there ever been a grocery store that looked like a warehouse?”</t5557>
<t5558>I exhale a long breath through my crooked lips.</t5558> <t5559>"Beats me.</t5559><t5560>"</t5560>
<t5561>"Oh my God, Margo's car!" Lacey shouted right next to me.</t5561> <t5562>"Yes yes yes yes yes yes Margo's car Margo's car!"</t5562>
<t5563>Radar stopped the car while I looked in the direction Lacey pointed across the field, behind the barn.</t5563> <t5564>A flash of silver.</t5564> <t5565>Leaning closer to Lacey, I saw the curved edge of the car roof.</t5565> <t5566>God only knows how the car got there, as there was no road leading in that direction.</t5566>
<t5567>Radar found a parking spot, I jumped out of the minivan and ran towards her car.</t5567> <t5568>Empty.</t5568> <t5569>Unlocked.</t5569> <t5570>I opened the trunk.</t5570> <t5571>Nothing either, except for an open and empty suitcase.</t5571> <t5572>I looked around, and walked towards what I now believed to be the remains of the Agloe General Store.</t5572> <t5573>Ben and Radar passed me as I ran across the mowed grass.</t5573> <t5574>We didn't enter the barn through the door but through one of the gaping holes, where the wooden wall had simply fallen apart.</t5574>
<t5575>In the warehouse, the sun shone down on the rotten wooden floorboards through numerous holes in the roof.</t5575> <t5576>While searching for her, I noted each thing: the damp floorboards.</t5576> <t5577>The smell of almonds, like her.</t5577> <t5578>A clawfoot bathtub in the corner.</t5578> <t5579>Holes everywhere, making this place both inside and outside at the same time.</t5579>
<t5580>I felt someone tugging hard at my shirt.</t5580> <t5581>I turned around and saw Ben, his eyes darting back and forth between me and a corner of the room.</t5581> <t5582>I had to look through a bright white area streaming down from the ceiling, but I could see that corner.</t5582> <t5583>Two long, chest-high, dirty and grayish plastic sheets leaned against each other forming a sharp angle, with wooden walls holding the sides.</t5583> <t5584>A triangular workspace, if such a thing existed.</t5584>
<t5585>And here is the noteworthy thing about the frosted window: light can pass through it.</t5585> <t5586>So I saw a poignant scene, though through a gray tint: Margo Roth Spiegelman sitting on a black leather office chair, hunched over a desk, like a student's desk, she was writing.</t5586> <t5587>Margo's hair was much shorter—her bangs were messy and falling over her eyebrows, everything in disarray, as if the emphasis was on eccentricity—but it was her.</t5587> <t5588>Margo was alive.</t5588> <t5589>She had moved her office from the abandoned mini-mall in Florida to an abandoned warehouse in New York, and I had found her.</t5589>
<t5590>We walked towards Margo, all four of us, but it seemed like she didn't notice.</t5590> <t5591>Margo kept writing.</t5591> <t5592>Finally, someone—Radar, it seemed—spoke up, "Margo."</t5592> <t5593>"Margo?"</t5593>
<t5594>She stood up and tiptoed, her hand resting on the edge of the wall of this makeshift office.</t5594> <t5595>If she was surprised to see us, her eyes did not show it at all.</t5595> <t5596>This is Margo Roth Spiegelman, about one and a half meters away from me, with dry, cracked lips, no makeup, dirt under her fingernails, and quiet eyes.</t5596> <t5597>I had never seen Margo's eyes so lifeless, but then again, perhaps I had never really looked into her eyes.</t5597> <t5598>Margo stared at me.</t5598> <t5599>I felt certain that she was looking at me and not at Lacey or Ben or Radar.</t5599> <t5600>I had not felt such an intense gaze since the dead eyes of Robert Joyner looked at me in Jefferson Park.</t5600>
<t5601>Margo stood silently like that for a long time, I was so afraid of her gaze that I didn't approach any closer.</t5601> <t5602>"We and this mystery here we stand," Whitman had written.</t5602>
<t5603>In the end, Margo said, "Give me five minutes," then sat down and started writing again.</t5603>
<t5604>I watched her write.</t5604> <t5605>Except for a little smudge, she looked just the same as before.</t5605> <t5606>I don't know why, but I had always thought she would look different.</t5606> <t5607>More mature.</t5607> <t5608>To the point where I would hardly recognize Margo when I finally met her again.</t5608> <t5609>But here she is, I'm looking at her through the frosted plastic, she looks like Margo Roth Spiegelman, my friend I've known since I was two—the girl who became an idea I fell in love with.</t5609>
<t5610>And only at this moment, when she closed the notebook, put it into the backpack next to her, and stood up to walk towards us, did I realize that the notion was not only wrong but also dangerous.</t5610> <t5611>Believing that a person is greater than themselves is such a precarious illusion.</t5611>
<t5612>“Hey,” Margo said to Lacey, smiling.</t5612> <t5613>She hugged Lacey first, then shook hands with Ben and Radar.</t5613> <t5614>She raised an eyebrow, said, “Hi Q,” then hugged me, briefly and not tightly.</t5614> <t5615>I wanted to hold on tight.</t5615> <t5616>I wanted a mark.</t5616> <t5617>I wanted to feel her sobbing in my arms, tears smudging from her dusty cheeks onto my shirt.</t5617> <t5618>But Margo just hugged me quickly and sat down on the floor.</t5618> <t5619>I sat down in front of her.</t5619> <t5620>Ben, Radar, and Lacey also sat down next to me in a row, so that all of us were facing Margo.</t5620>
<t5621>"Seeing you is a relief," I said after a while, feeling as if I were interrupting a silent prayer.</t5621>
<t5622>Margo brushed her bangs to the side.</t5622> <t5623>It seemed like she was deciding exactly what to say before speaking.</t5623> <t5624>“I, um. Um.</t5624> <t5625>I'm not often at a loss for words, right? Haven't talked to anyone much lately.</t5625> <t5626>Hmm.</t5626> <t5627>Maybe you guys should go first, what the heck are you doing here?”</t5627>
<t5628>“Margo,” Lacey said. “God knows, we were so worried.”</t5628>
<t5629>“Why worry,” Margo replied cheerfully. “I’m fine.” She gave two thumbs up. “I’m grade A fine.”</t5629>
<t5630>"You should have called to let us know," Ben said, his voice slightly tinged with irritation. "So that we wouldn't have to go through all this trouble."</t5630>
<t5631>“In my experience, Ben Bỉ Bựa, when leaving a place, it's best to just go.</t5631> <t5632>But why are you wearing a dress like this?”</t5632>
<t5633>Ben blushed.</t5633> <t5634>"Don't call him that," Lacey raised her voice.</t5634>
<t5635>Margo turned to look at Lacey.</t5635> <t5636>“Oh my God, are you dating him?” Lacey said nothing. “You’re not actually dating him,” Margo continued.</t5636>
<t5637>“There really is,” Lacey said.</t5637> <t5638>“He really is very nice.</t5638> <t5639>You're the real jerk.</t5639> <t5640>And really, I'm leaving.</t5640> <t5641>It was nice to meet you, Margo.</t5641> <t5642>Thanks for freaking me out, making me feel like crap for almost the entire last month of senior year, and thanks for being a bitch when we came all this way to see how you were doing.</t5642> <t5643>It was a pleasure knowing you.”</t5643>
<t5644>“What makes you any better.</t5644> <t5645>Without you, how could I know just how fat I am?” Lacey stood up and stormed off, each step causing the creaky floor to shake.</t5645> <t5646>Ben followed her.</t5646> <t5647>I looked over, and Radar stood up as well.</t5647>
<t5648>"I didn't know you at all until I gradually got to know you through the clues you left behind," Radar said.</t5648> <t5649>"I liked those clues more than I liked you."</t5649>
<t5650>“What the heck is he rambling about?” Margo asked me.</t5650> <t5651>Radar didn't respond, he just walked away.</t5651>
<t5652>I should go too, of course.</t5652> <t5653>We are closer friends than Margo, definitely.</t5653> <t5654>But I have questions.</t5654> <t5655>As Margo stood up and started to return to the work corner, I asked a straightforward question.</t5655> <t5656>“Why are you behaving so badly?”</t5656>
<t5657>Margo suddenly turned around, grabbed my shirt collar, and shouted in my face, "Why did you all suddenly come here without any prior notice?</t5657><t5658>!”</t5658>
<t5659>“How could I inform you when you completely disappeared from the surface of this planet?!” I saw Margo close her eyes for a long time, and I knew she couldn't answer, so I just burst out.</t5659> <t5660>I was mad at Margo. Because... because, I don't know.</t5660> <t5661>This wasn't the Margo I had expected.</t5661> <t5662>This wasn't the Margo I thought I had finally imagined correctly.</t5662> <t5663>“I thought there must have been a legitimate reason why you didn't contact anyone after that night.</t5663> <t5664>And... is this your legitimate reason?</t5664> <t5665>Turns out you could wander around living homeless like this</t5665><t5666>?”</t5666>
<t5667>Margo let go and pushed me away.</t5667> <t5668>“Now who's homeless? I left in the only way one can leave.</t5668> <t5669>Ripping my life off all at once–like a band-aid.</t5669> <t5670>Then you become you, Lacey becomes Lacey, someone becomes someone, and I become me.</t5670><t5671>”</t5671>
<t5672>“Except I wasn't myself, Margo, because I thought you were dead.</t5672> <t5673>For the longest time.</t5673> <t5674>So I had to do all those terrible things that I would never have done otherwise.”</t5674>
<t5675>Margo screamed, moving closer so she could look me straight in the eye. "Don't talk nonsense.</t5675> <t5676>You didn't come here to make sure I'm safe and sound.</t5676> <t5677>You came because you want to save poor little Margo from her little troubled self, so that I would be oh-so-moved by the gallant knight and strip off my clothes and beg you to ruin my body, right."</t5677>
<t5678>“What nonsense are you talking about!” I shouted, almost like that.</t5678> <t5679>“You’re just playing us, right?</t5679> <t5680>You just want to make sure that even though you’ve left and have new fun, you will still be the axis around which we revolve.</t5680><t5681>”</t5681>
<t5682>Margo screamed back, louder than I thought she could scream.</t5682> <t5683>“You don't even bother to get mad at me, Q! You're just mad because of the fantasies about me that you've been holding onto since childhood!”</t5683>
<t5684>She tried to run away from me, but I grabbed Margo by the shoulders, turned her to face me, and said, "Have you ever thought about how your departure might affect others?</t5684> <t5685>Ruthie? Lacey or me or anyone else who cares about you? You haven't thought at all.</t5685> <t5686>Of course, you haven't thought about it.</t5686> <t5687>Because if you're okay, then nothing else matters.</t5687> <t5688>Isn't that right, Margo? Isn't it?"</t5688>
<t5689>Now she doesn't resist anymore.</t5689> <t5690>Margo just shrugged and turned away, going back to her workspace.</t5690> <t5691>She kicked down both hard plastic panels used as walls, which hit the table and chairs hard before sliding to the floor. "SHUT UP SHUT UP YOU JERK."</t5691>
<t5692>"Okay," I said.</t5692> <t5693>Something in the completely uncontrolled emotional outburst of Margo made me hold myself back.</t5693> <t5694>I tried to speak like my mother. "I will be silent.</t5694> <t5695>Neither of us is happy.</t5695> <t5696>There are still many, um, unresolved issues from my side.</t5696><t5697>"</t5697>
<t5698>Margo sat down on the swivel chair, her feet placed on what used to be the partition wall of the workspace.</t5698> <t5699>She looked at a corner of the warehouse.</t5699> <t5700>We were at least three meters apart.</t5700> <t5701>"How the hell did you guys find me?"</t5701>
<t5702>“I thought you wanted us to find you,” I replied, speaking very softly but surprisingly Margo still heard.</t5702> <t5703>She turned her chair around and looked at me intently.</t5703>
<t5704>“Surely, I didn't want that.”</t5704>
<t5705>“‘Song of Myself,’” I said.</t5705> <t5706>“Guthrie led me to Whitman.</t5706> <t5707>Whitman led me to the door.</t5707> <t5708>The door led me to the mini-mall.</t5708> <t5709>We discovered how to read the graffiti that had been painted over.</t5709> <t5710>I didn’t understand what ‘paper towns’ meant; it could be unfinished subdivisions, so I thought you had gone to such a place and would never come back.</t5710> <t5711>I thought you had died in one of those places, that you had committed suicide and for some reason wanted me to find you.</t5711> <t5712>I went to a bunch of places like that, looking for you.</t5712> <t5713>But then I matched the map from the souvenir shop with the pinholes on the wall.</t5713> <t5714>I started reading the poem more closely, realizing that maybe you weren’t running away but just hiding somewhere, making plans.</t5714> <t5715>Writing in that notebook.</t5715> <t5716>I found Agloe on the map, read your comment on the discussion page in the Omnictionary, I skipped graduation and drove straight here.”</t5716>
<t5717>Margo brushed her hair down, but it was no longer long enough to cover her face. "I hate this hairstyle," Margo said.</t5717> <t5718>"I just wanted to look different, but– it turned out so silly."</t5718>
<t5719>"I like this style," I said.</t5719> <t5720>"The way your hair frames your face looks really good."</t5720>
<t5721>“I'm sorry for making such a fuss over nothing,” she said.</t5721> <t5722>“You have to understand that–suddenly you all came in here, it scared me stiff–”</t5722>
<t5723>“You should have just said, ‘Hey, you guys scared me stiff.’” I said.</t5723>
<t5724>Margo gave a faint smile.</t5724> <t5725>“Yeah, right, because that's the Margo Roth Spiegelman everyone knows and loves.” She was silent for a moment, then continued, “I know I shouldn't say things like that in the Omnictionary. I just thought if someone reads it later, it would be really funny.</t5725> <t5726>I think the police might follow that clue, but not very soon.</t5726> <t5727>There are billions of pages in the Omnictionary after all.</t5727> <t5728>I never thought...”</t5728>
<t5729>"What?"</t5729>
<t5730>“I’ve thought a lot about you, here’s the answer to your question.</t5730> <t5731>And thought about Ruthie.</t5731> <t5732>And my parents.</t5732> <t5733>Of course, right? Maybe I’m the most severely solitary person in human history.</t5733> <t5734>But God, do you think I would do this if I didn’t have to?” Margo shook her head.</t5734> <t5735>Now, finally, she turned fully towards me, elbows resting on her knees, and we talked.</t5735> <t5736>Still far apart, but still talking to each other.</t5736> <t5737>“I couldn’t find any other way to leave without being pulled back.”</t5737>
<t5738>“I'm glad you didn't die,” I said to Margo.</t5738>
<t5739>“Yeah, me too,” she replied, with a slight smirk.</t5739> <t5740>It was the first time I saw the smile that I had longed for so long. “That's why I have to go.</t5740> <t5741>No matter how miserable life gets, there are always other choices.” My phone rang.</t5741> <t5742>It was Ben. I picked up.</t5742>
<t5743>“Lacey wants to talk to Margo,” Ben told me.</t5743>
<t5744>I walked over to Margo, handed her the phone, and lingered by her side while she sat hunched forward, listening.</t5744> <t5745>I heard noises coming from the phone, then I heard Margo interrupt and say, "Listen, I'm really sorry.</t5745> <t5746>I was just scared." And then silence.</t5746> <t5747>Finally, Lacey spoke again, and Margo laughed out loud, saying something in response.</t5747> <t5748>Thinking they needed some privacy, I started wandering around exploring.</t5748> <t5749>Leaning against the same wall as the workspace, but in the opposite corner of the warehouse, Margo had set up what could be called a bed—four slats beneath an orange air mattress.</t5749> <t5750>Margo's small, neatly folded stack of clothes was next to the bed, also on a slat.</t5750> <t5751>There was a toothbrush and toothpaste, with a large plastic cup from Subway.</t5751> <t5752>These items were on top of two books: Sylvia Plath's The Bell Jar and Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five.</t5752> <t5753>I couldn't believe that Margo had been living like this, this irreconcilable mix of charming suburban neatness and eerie dilapidation.</t5753> <t5754>But then again, I couldn't believe how much time I had spent thinking she was living so differently.</t5754>
<t5755>"They are at a lodge in the park area."</t5755> <t5756>"Lace told me to tell you that they will leave today, whether you go with them or not," Margo spoke from behind me.</t5756> <t5757>It was when she said 'you' instead of 'us' that I first thought about what would happen next.</t5757>
<t5758>“I’m almost self-sufficient,” Margo said, now standing next to me.</t5758> <t5759>“There’s a toilet out there, but it’s not very nice, so I usually go to the restroom at the truck stop north of Roscoe.</t5759> <t5760>They also have showers there, and the women’s shower is very clean because there aren’t many female truck drivers.</t5760> <t5761>Plus, they have Internet there.</t5761> <t5762>It’s kind of like this place is my home, and the truck stop is my seaside resort.”</t5762> <t5763>I laughed.</t5763>
<t5764>Margo walked past me and knelt down, looking into the bed slats.</t5764> <t5765>She pulled out a flashlight and a square plastic object.</t5765> <t5766>“Except for gas and food, these are the only two things I've bought all month.</t5766> <t5767>I've only spent about three hundred dollars.”</t5767> <t5768>I took the square object from her hand, finally realizing it was a battery-operated music player. “I brought some albums with me,” Margo said.</t5768> <t5769>“But I'll get more when we get to the city.”</t5769>
<t5770>“The city?”</t5770>
<t5771>“Yes.</t5771> <t5772>Today I will go to New York City. That's why there was a comment on Everything Encyclopedia. I will truly begin the journey.</t5772> <t5773>Initially, today was the day I planned to leave Orlando—I would attend the graduation, do all the well-planned pranks on graduation night with you, and then I would leave the next morning.</t5773> <t5774>But I couldn't endure it any longer.</t5774> <t5775>I really couldn't bear another hour.</t5775> <t5776>And when I found out about Jase—I thought, ‘I have everything planned out; I just need to change the dates.’</t5776> <t5777>But I'm sorry for scaring you.</t5777> <t5778>I tried not to make you panic, but the last part was a bit rushed.</t5778> <t5779>Not my finest work.”</t5779>
<t5780>When the hastily sketched escape plans with many clues hinting at the departure, I thought it was very impressive.</t5780> <t5781>But I was almost surprised that in the original plan she also wanted me to be involved.</t5781> <t5782>“Maybe you'll tell me,” I said, trying to smile.</t5782> <t5783>“You know, I've been wondering a lot.</t5783> <t5784>What is in the plan and what is not?</t5784> <t5785>What does everything mean? Why do the clues point to me, why are you leaving, that sort of thing.”</t5785>
<t5786>“Okay, fine.</t5786> <t5787>Alright.</t5787> <t5788>With that story, we have to start with another story.”</t5788> <t5789>Margo stood up, I followed as Margo walked gracefully, avoiding the creaky floorboards.</t5789> <t5790>Returning to the work corner, she searched in her backpack and took out a black leather notebook.</t5790> <t5791>Margo sat down on the floor, crossed her legs, and patted the wooden floor right next to her.</t5791> <t5792>I sat down.</t5792> <t5793>Margo opened the notebook.</t5793> <t5794>“This,” she said, “so this started a long time ago.</t5794> <t5795>Back around fourth grade, I started writing in here.</t5795> <t5796>A kind of detective story.”</t5796>
<t5797>I think if I snatch the notebook from Margo now, I can use it to set conditions.</t5797> <t5798>I can leverage it to make her return to Orlando, and Margo will get a summer job, stay in an apartment until the university year starts, and at least the two of us will have a summer.</t5798> <t5799>But I just listen.</t5799>
<t5800>“I don't want to brag, but this is truly a rare and excellent piece of work.</t5800> <t5801>Alright, just kidding.</t5801> <t5802>It's just my ten-year-old self writing a bunch of rambling, magical, and wildly imaginative nonsense.</t5802> <t5803>It starts with this girl named Margo Spiegelman, who is like me when I was ten in every way, except her parents are kind, super rich, and buy her everything she wants.</t5803> <t5804>Margo likes a boy named Quentin, who is like you in every way, except for his heroic bravery, willingness to sacrifice to protect me, and other things.</t5804> <t5805>There's also a character named Myrna Mountweazel, who is like the real Myrna Mountweazel in every way, except for her extraordinary magical abilities.</t5805> <t5806>For example, in the story, anyone who pets Myrna Mountweazel cannot lie for ten minutes.</t5806> <t5807>Also, she can talk.</t5807> <t5808>Of course she can talk.</t5808> <t5809>Is there any ten-year-old who would write a story about a dog that can't talk?”</t5809>
<t5810>I laughed out loud, still lost in thoughts about ten-year-old Margo liking ten-year-old me.</t5810>
<t5811>"So in the story," Margo continued, "Quentin, Margo, and Myrna Mountweazel investigate the death of Robert Joyner, a character who died in a manner similar to how Robert Joyner died in real life, except that someone shot him in the face rather than him clearly shooting himself in the face."</t5811> <t5812>And the plot revolves around the process of investigating the criminal.</t5812><t5813>"</t5813>
<t5814>"So who fired the shot?"</t5814>
<t5815>Margo laughed out loud.</t5815> <t5816>"Do you want me to tell you the whole plot first?"</t5816>
<t5817>"No," I replied, "I'd rather read it myself." Margo opened the book and showed me a page.</t5817> <t5818>The handwriting was very hard to read, not because Margo wrote poorly, but because on the horizontal lines, the letters also ran straight down to the bottom of the page.</t5818> <t5819>"I write them interwoven like that," Margo explained.</t5819> <t5820>"Non-Margo readers would find it hard to decipher.</t5820> <t5821>Alright, I'll reveal the plot to you, but you have to promise not to get mad."</t5821>
<t5822>“Promise,” I replied.</t5822>
<t5823>“It turns out the perpetrator is the brother of the sister of Robert Joyner's former wife who was an alcoholic. The culprit went mad because he was haunted by the evil spirit of an ancient Egyptian house cat.</t5823> <t5824>I told you, this is top-tier stuff.</t5824> <t5825>But anyway, you, I, and Myrna Mountweazel set out and confronted the culprit.</t5825> <t5826>He tried to shoot me, but you jumped in to take the bullet, and then you tragically sacrificed yourself in my arms.”</t5826>
<t5827>I laughed heartily. "Great.</t5827> <t5828>At first, it sounds promising with a beautiful girl falling for me, full of mysteries and schemes, then I just die and that's the end of it."</t5828>
<t5829>“Yeah, that's it.” Margo laughed.</t5829> <t5830>“But I had to let you die, because the only other possible ending was us doing it, and I wasn't emotionally ready to write that at ten years old.</t5830><t5831>”</t5831>
<t5832>"Alright, that makes sense," I said.</t5832> <t5833>"But when you rewrite it, I want a bit more action.</t5833><t5834>"</t5834>
<t5835>“After you were shot down by the villain, probably.</t5835> <t5836>A kiss before the last breath.”</t5836>
<t5837>"You are so kind." I could stand up, get close, and kiss her.</t5837> <t5838>I could.</t5838> <t5839>But there are still too many things that would be ruined.</t5839>
<t5840>“Anyway, in fifth grade, I finished the story.</t5840> <t5841>A few years later, I decided to leave for Mississippi.</t5841> <t5842>I wrote all the plans for that outrageous trip in this notebook, above the old story, and eventually I carried out the plan–took my mom's car, drove a thousand miles, and left clues in the soup.</t5842> <t5843>I didn't even like the road trip, really–it was terribly lonely–but I liked completing it, right?</t5843> <t5844>So I wrote more plans in here–pranks, matchmaking between girls and boys, a grand toilet papering campaign, more secret road trips, and anything else.</t5844> <t5845>By the beginning of tenth grade, the notebook was half full, and that's when I decided to do one more thing, a shocking one, and then leave.”</t5845>
<t5846>Margo was about to continue speaking, but I had to stop her.</t5846> <t5847>“I’m wondering if it’s because of the space or the people?”</t5847> <t5848>If the people around you were different, what would happen?”</t5848>
<t5849>“How can you separate those two sides?</t5849> <t5850>People are the land and the land is people.</t5850> <t5851>Anyway, I don't think I can be friends with anyone else.</t5851> <t5852>I think everyone is either scared like you, or indifferent like Lacey.</t5852> <t5853>And–”</t5853>
<t5854>"I'm not as scared as you think," I said.</t5854> <t5855>That's right.</t5855> <t5856>I only realized it was true after I had declared it.</t5856> <t5857>But it was still true.</t5857>
<t5858>"I'm so fed up," Margo said, her voice almost hissing.</t5858> <t5859>"Then when I was in tenth grade, Gus took me to Osprey—" I tilted my head, not understanding. "The mini mall."</t5859> <t5860>Then I started going there by myself, just messing around and writing plans.</t5860> <t5861>By the end of last year, all the plans were aimed at this final escape.</t5861> <t5862>I don't know if it was because I was writing and rereading old stories, but I soon included you in this new plan.</t5862> <t5863>The main idea was that we would do all these things together—like sneaking into SeaWorld, that was in the original plan—I would push you to become a tough, prominent guy.</t5863> <t5864>The final night would, well, liberate you.</t5864> <t5865>Then I would disappear, and you would always remember me for that.</t5865>
<t5866>“Finally, this plan is seventy pages long, ready to happen, with very smooth steps.</t5866> <t5867>But then I found out about Jase, and I decided to leave immediately.</t5867> <t5868>Right away.</t5868> <t5869>I don't need to graduate.</t5869> <t5870>What's the point of graduating?</t5870> <t5871>But I have to tie up the loose ends first.</t5871> <t5872>So that whole day at school, I took out my notebook, frantically trying to fit the plan with Becca, Jase, and Lacey, and anyone who wasn't my friend as if I had considered them friends.</t5872> <t5873>I came up with more ideas to let everyone know how fed up I was before I ditched them forever.</t5873>
<t5874>"But I want to do it together with you; I still hold the idea that I can at least create the image of a brave hero in my children's story within you."</t5874>
<t5875>“And then you surprised me,” Margo continued.</t5875> <t5876>“All those years, to me, you were a paper boy—two-dimensional like a character on a page, and two-dimensional, but still flat, like a person.</t5876> <t5877>But that night you became very real.</t5877> <t5878>And the whole thing ended so strangely, funnily, dreamily that the next morning I went back to my room and just missed you.</t5878> <t5879>I wanted to run over, play, and chat about random things, but I had decided to leave, so I had to go.</t5879> <t5880>In the last moment, I came up with the idea to show you the way to Osprey.</t5880> <t5881>Leaving it for you so you could further progress in the field of not-playing-the-scaredy-cat.</t5881>
<t5882>"Yeah, that's it.</t5882> <t5883>I managed really quickly.</t5883> <t5884>I stuck the Woody poster on the back of the curtain, circled the song title on the record, marked two lines in the song "Soliloquy" with a different color from the one I had previously used when I actually read it myself.</t5884> <t5885>Then after you went to school, I climbed through your window and tucked the note in the door frame.</t5885> <t5886>That morning I went to Osprey, partly because I didn't feel ready, partly because I wanted to clean the place up for you.</t5886> <t5887>Honestly, I didn't want you to worry.</t5887> <t5888>So I painted over the graffiti, I didn't know you could read it.</t5888> <t5889>I tore up the desk calendars I had used, and took down the map.</t5889> <t5890>I had hung it up since I discovered Agloe was there.</t5890> <t5891>Then because I was tired and had nowhere else to go, I slept there.</t5891> <t5892>I stayed for about two nights, actually wanting to pull myself together and gather some courage, I guess.</t5892> <t5893>I also thought, I don't know, maybe you would quickly find this place.</t5893> <t5894>So I left.</t5894> <t5895>It took two days to get here.</t5895> <t5896>Since then, I've been here."</t5896>
<t5897>It seems like Margo has told everything, but I still have one more question. "Why this place?"</t5897>
<t5898>“A paper town for a paper girl,” Margo replied. “I read about Agloe in the book ‘Amazing Facts’ when I was ten or eleven years old.</t5898> <t5899>I kept thinking about it.</t5899> <t5900>The truth is, whenever I stood atop the SunTrust building–including the last time with you–I didn’t really look down and think about how everything was made of paper.</t5900> <t5901>I looked down and thought about how I was made of paper.</t5901> <t5902>I am that fragile, easily folded, easily crumpled person, nothing else.</t5902> <t5903>And the problem is right here.</t5903> <t5904>Everyone loves the idea of a paper girl.</t5904> <t5905>They always have.</t5905> <t5906>And the worst part is, I liked it too.</t5906> <t5907>I nurtured that idea, you know?</t5907>
<t5908>“Because it's also fun.</t5908> <t5909>It's a concept that everyone likes.</t5909> <t5910>But I can't be a concept to myself, I can't be a concept my whole life.</t5910> <t5911>Agloe is a place where a product on paper has become real.</t5911> <t5912>A dot on the map has become a real place, more real than the creators of that dot could have imagined.</t5912> <t5913>I thought maybe the paper cut-out girl could start to become real from this place.</t5913> <t5914>And maybe that's the way to tell the paper girl who always wants to be admired, always concerned about clothes and other things: ‘There will be paper towns.</t5914> <t5915>And you will never come back.</t5915><t5916>’”</t5916>
<t5917>“That graffiti,” I said.</t5917> <t5918>“Oh my God, Margo, I went to so many abandoned subdivisions like that to find your body.</t5918> <t5919>I really thought–I really thought you were dead.”</t5919>
<t5920>Margo stood up, searched in her backpack for a moment, then reached out to grab the book "The Bell Jar," and read aloud to me.</t5920> <t5921>“‘But at that decisive moment, the skin on my wrist was so white and unresisting, I couldn't do it anymore.</t5921> <t5922>It seemed that what I wanted to kill was not in that skin, or in the thin blue vein pulsing under my finger, but somewhere else, deeper, more secretive, and infinitely harder to reach.’” Margo sat back down next to me, close, facing me, our jeans touching but our knees not.</t5922> <t5923>Margo said, “I understand what she meant.</t5923> <t5924>That somewhere else deeper and more secretive.</t5924> <t5925>It's like the cracks inside you.</t5925> <t5926>Like there are flawed lines where things don't fit together.”</t5926>
<t5927>"I think it's good," I said.</t5927> <t5928>"Or like the cracks on the ship's hull."</t5928>
<t5929>"Yes, yes."</t5929>
<t5930>“It will drag you down no matter what.</t5930><t5931>”</t5931>
<t5932>"Exactly," Margo exclaimed.</t5932> <t5933>We talked back and forth quite quickly.</t5933>
<t5934>"I can't believe you don't want me to come looking for you."</t5934>
<t5935>“I'm sorry.”</t5935> <t5936>“If saying it had any effect, I would be quite impressed.”</t5936> <t5937>“But it's really fun having you here.”</t5937> <t5938>“You are a wonderful companion.”</t5938>
<t5939>“Is that an invitation?” I asked.</t5939>
<t5940>“I guess so.” She smiled.</t5940>
<t5941>My heart was dancing incessantly in my chest because this state of intoxication seemed to last forever–but only almost.</t5941> <t5942>“Margo, if you come to stay at my house this summer–my parents have said that you can stay with my family, or you can get a job and rent an apartment for the summer, then the college semester will start, and you will never have to live with your parents again.”</t5942>
<t5943>“It's not just them.</t5943> <t5944>I feel weary from the inside,” Margo replied, “and I have never escaped it.</t5944> <t5945>It's not just the trivial matters, parties, and all the other dull nonsense, but the entire aura of a life lived correctly—college, job, husband, children, and all those kinds of illusions.”</t5945>
<t5946>The issue is whether I believe in college, jobs, and perhaps one day, children.</t5946> <t5947>I believe in the future.</t5947> <t5948>Maybe it's a flaw in my character, but for me, it's innate.</t5948> <t5949>"But going to college will give you more opportunities," I finally said, "College doesn't reduce possibilities."</t5949>
<t5950>Margo smirked.</t5950> <t5951>“Thank you, College Counseling Expert Jacobsen,” she said, then changed the subject.</t5951> <t5952>“I often think of you when I'm in Osprey.</t5952> <t5953>Whether you're familiar with it or not.</t5953> <t5954>Don't worry about the rats.</t5954><t5955>”</t5955>
<t5956>“I'm familiar with it,” I replied.</t5956> <t5957>“I'm starting to like that place.</t5957> <t5958>In fact, I spent the entire prom night there.”</t5958>
<t5959>She laughed.</t5959> <t5960>"Great."</t5960> <t5961>"I had a feeling you would like that place."</t5961> <t5962>"I've never gotten bored at Osprey, but that's because sooner or later I always have to go home."</t5962> <t5963>"When I'm here, I get really bored too."</t5963> <t5964>"There's nothing to do, I've read a lot since I got here."</t5964> <t5965>"The longer I stay, the more tense I feel, I don't know anyone."</t5965> <t5966>"I keep waiting for the loneliness and tension to take me home."</t5966> <t5967>"But that doesn't happen."</t5967> <t5968>"There's one thing I can't do, Q."</t5968>
<t5969>I nodded. I understood that.</t5969> <t5970>I could imagine how hard it would be to return once you have felt the continents in the palm of your hand.</t5970> <t5971>But I still tried a little more.</t5971> <t5972>"What about the summer then?</t5972> <t5973>What about college? What about the rest of your life?"</t5973>
<t5974>Margo shrugged.</t5974> <t5975>“What about those things?”</t5975>
<t5976>“Aren't you worried about, um, forever?”</t5976>
<t5977>“Forever is the harmony of the present,” Margo replied.</t5977> <t5978>I didn't know what to say, just tried to swallow as Margo said, “That's Emily Dickinson.</t5978> <t5979>I told you, I read a lot.</t5979><t5980>”</t5980>
<t5981>I think the future deserves our trust.</t5981> <t5982>But it's hard to argue with Emily Dickinson.</t5982> <t5983>Margo stood up, slung her backpack over her shoulder, and extended her hand to me. "Let's go for a walk."</t5983> <t5984>Once outside, Margo asked to borrow my phone.</t5984> <t5985>She dialed a number, and I was about to leave to give her some privacy, but Margo grabbed my hand to keep me there.</t5985> <t5986>So I walked with Margo to the field while she talked to her parents.</t5986>
<t5987>"Yes, it's Margo here...</t5987> <t5988>I'm in Agloe, New York, with Quentin... Uh... no, mom, I want to answer you honestly...</t5988> <t5989>Mom, come on...</t5989> <t5990>I don't know, mom...</t5990> <t5991>I've decided to move to a place that doesn't exist.</t5991> <t5992>That's how it happened...</t5992> <t5993>Yes, well, but anyway, I didn't think I would be seen as that kind of person...</t5993> <t5994>Can I talk to Ruthie?...</t5994> <t5995>Oh, hey there, sweetie...</t5995> <t5996>Yeah, yeah, I love you the most... Yeah, I'm really sorry.</t5996> <t5997>So, it was a mistake.</t5997> <t5998>I thought– I don't even know what I thought, Ruthie, but I know it was my fault, from now on I'll call.</t5998> <t5999>I probably won't call mom, but I will definitely call you...</t5999> <t6000>Wednesdays, okay?...</t6000> <t6001>You're busy on Wednesdays? Hmm, alright.</t6001> <t6002>So what day works for you?...</t6002> <t6003>Tuesday is... yeah... so every Tuesday then...</t6003> <t6004>Yeah, starting this Tuesday." Margo closed her eyes tightly, her teeth slightly clenched.</t6004> <t6005>"Alright, good girl, now give the phone back to mom, okay?...</t6005> <t6006>I love you, mom. I'll be fine, I swear...</t6006> <t6007>Yes, okay, you too, mom.</t6007> <t6008>Goodbye, mom."</t6008>
<t6009>Margo stopped, ended the call but still held the phone in her hand for about a minute.</t6009> <t6010>I saw her fingertips turn pink from gripping tightly, then she dropped the phone to the ground.</t6010> <t6011>Margo's scream was short but piercing, and then for the first time, I noticed the profound silence of Agloe.</t6011> <t6012>“My mom thinks my job is to please her, and that should be my greatest wish, and when I no longer please her, I get thrown out.</t6012> <t6013>She changed all the locks.</t6013> <t6014>That was the first thing she told me.</t6014> <t6015>Oh my God.”</t6015>
<t6016>“I'm very sorry,” I said, pushing aside the knee-high grass, half yellow and half green, to pick up the phone.</t6016> <t6017>“But was it fun talking to Ruthie?”</t6017>
<t6018>“Yes, the girl is very nice and lovely.</t6018> <t6019>I feel really bad because—you know—I didn't say anything to her.</t6019><t6020>”</t6020>
<t6021>“It's okay,” I said.</t6021> <t6022>Margo playfully hit me.</t6022>
<t6023>“You were supposed to make me feel better, not worse!” Margo said. “That’s your whole talent!”</t6023>
<t6024>"I didn't know it turned out my job was to please you, Ms. Spiegelman.</t6024><t6025>"</t6025>
<t6026>Margo laughed out loud.</t6026> <t6027>“Oh, comparing with the mothers. An honor that makes you break a sweat.</t6027> <t6028>But there's some truth to it.</t6028> <t6029>So how have you been lately?</t6029> <t6030>If Ben is flirting with Lacey, surely you've been having hot nights with a dozen cheerleaders.”</t6030>
<t6031>We slowly walked on the uneven ground of this field.</t6031> <t6032>At first glance, the field didn't seem large, but as we walked, I realized it didn't look like we were getting any closer to the trees in the distance.</t6032> <t6033>I told Margo about the escape from the graduation ceremony, the spectacular spins of the Top. I told her about the prom, Lacey fighting with Becca, and the night I spent at Osprey.</t6033> <t6034>"That was the night I really knew for sure you had been there," I said to Margo.</t6034> <t6035>"The blanket still smelled like you."</t6035>
<t6036>When I said that, Margo's hand gently touched me, and I immediately held that hand, because it felt like there were fewer things that could be ruined at that moment.</t6036> <t6037>Margo looked at me. "I had to leave.</t6037> <t6038>I didn't need to scare you and that was really stupid.</t6038> <t6039>I should have left more neatly, but I really had to go.</t6039> <t6040>Do you understand?"</t6040>
<t6041>“Yes,” I replied, “but I think now you can also return.</t6041> <t6042>That's exactly what I think.”</t6042>
<t6043>“No, you don't think that way,” Margo replied, and she was right.</t6043> <t6044>She could see it on my face–now I understand that I can't be her and she can't be me.</t6044> <t6045>Maybe Whitman has a talent that I don't have.</t6045> <t6046>For me: I have to ask the wounded person where he is hurt, because I can't become the wounded person.</t6046> <t6047>The only wounded person I can be is myself.</t6047>
<t6048>I trampled a patch of grass and sat down.</t6048> <t6049>Margo lay down next to me, resting her head on the backpack.</t6049> <t6050>I lay down as well.</t6050> <t6051>Margo took some books out of the backpack and gave them to me to use as a pillow.</t6051> <t6052>A collection of Emily Dickinson's poetry and Leaves of Grass.</t6052> <t6053>“I have two books,” Margo said, smiling.</t6053>
<t6054>“A beautiful poem,” I said to Margo.</t6054> <t6055>“You couldn't have chosen better.”</t6055>
<t6056>"Actually, it was just a spontaneous decision that morning.</t6056> <t6057>I remembered a quote about doors and thought it was very fitting.</t6057> <t6058>But then when I got here, I read it again.</t6058> <t6059>I hadn't read it again since I was in tenth grade studying the national language.</t6059> <t6060>Yes, I really liked that poem.</t6060> <t6061>I tried to read a lot of poetry.</t6061> <t6062>I tried to understand—yes, what was it that surprised me so much about you that night? For a long time, I thought maybe it was when you read T. S. Eliot."</t6062>
<t6063>“But that's not it,” I said.</t6063> <t6064>“You're astonished by the mouse's biceps and my charming leap through the window, aren't you?”</t6064>
<t6065>Margo smirked.</t6065> <t6066>"Shut up and let me compliment you, you chatterbox.</t6066> <t6067>It's not poetry, you little mouse.</t6067> <t6068>What surprises me is that despite the stress and everything else, you have been like Quentin in my story.</t6068> <t6069>I've been writing in the margins of those pages for years, and every time I write, I reread the story, always laughing to myself, like–don't be offended–'God, I can't believe I once thought Quentin Jacobsen was such a super hot, super dedicated justice warrior.'</t6069> <t6070>But then–you know–you kind of are."</t6070>
<t6071>I can turn sideways, she can also turn sideways, and then we can kiss each other.</t6071> <t6072>But in the end, what is the point of kissing her now? It won't lead anywhere.</t6072> <t6073>We both looked up at the clear sky.</t6073> <t6074>"Nothing happens the way we imagine it," she said.</t6074>
<t6075>The sky at this moment is like a monochromatic contemporary painting, drawing me in with the illusion of its depth, pulling me ever upwards.</t6075> <t6076>"Yes, that's right," I said.</t6076> <t6077>But then, after a second of thought, I added, "But if we don't imagine, nothing can happen at all." Imagination is not perfect.</t6077> <t6078>We cannot imagine every aspect inside another person.</t6078> <t6079>I had never imagined that Margo could get as angry as she just did, nor the story she had written.</t6079> <t6080>But imagining oneself as someone else, or imagining the world differently, is the only way to get inside.</t6080> <t6081>That is the machine that can destroy fascists.</t6081>
<t6082>Margo turned and rested her head on my shoulder, and we lay there, just as I had imagined long ago, the two of us lying on the grass in SeaWorld. It took thousands of miles and many days, but now we are here: her head resting on my shoulder, her breath on my neck, the fatigue deeply embedded in both of us.</t6082> <t6083>We are now just as I had once wished.</t6083>
<t6084>When I woke up, the daylight was fading, making everything look so special, from the golden sky to the blades of grass above me, swaying like beauty queens.</t6084> <t6085>I lay on my side, seeing Margo Roth Spiegelman kneeling on the ground a few meters away from me, her jeans clinging to her legs.</t6085> <t6086>It took me a moment to realize Margo was digging.</t6086> <t6087>I crawled over and started digging next to her, the soil beneath the dry grass crumbling like dust in my fingers.</t6087> <t6088>Margo looked at me and smiled.</t6088> <t6089>My heart pounded wildly like the speed of sound.</t6089>
<t6090>“What are we digging?” I asked her.</t6090>
<t6091>“That's not the right question,” Margo replied.</t6091> <t6092>“The question should be, who are we digging for?”</t6092>
<t6093>“Alright, who am I digging the soil for?”</t6093>
<t6094>“I am digging a grave for little Margo, little Quentin, the dog Myrna Mountweazel, and poor deceased Mr. Robert Joyner,” Margo replied.</t6094>
<t6095>“I think I'm overwhelmed with all these funerals,” I said.</t6095> <t6096>The ground was rough and dry, crisscrossed with the paths of underground insects, looking like an abandoned ant farm.</t6096> <t6097>We dug into the earth with our bare hands, each handful of soil accompanied by a small cloud of dust.</t6097> <t6098>The two of us dug a deep and wide hole.</t6098> <t6099>This grave is just perfect.</t6099> <t6100>Soon, I was digging down to my elbows.</t6100> <t6101>My sleeves got dusty as I wiped the sweat off my cheek.</t6101> <t6102>Her cheeks turned rosy.</t6102> <t6103>I could smell Margo, she smelled just like that night, right before we jumped into the moat at SeaWorld.</t6103>
<t6104>“I never really thought that he was a real person,” she said.</t6104>
<t6105>While Margo was talking, I took advantage of the break and sat down.</t6105> <t6106>"Who, Robert Joyner?"</t6106>
<t6107>Margo kept digging. "Yeah.</t6107> <t6108>He was like something that happened to me, you know? But before he was this little character in the play of my life, he was—you know, the main character in the play of his own life."</t6108>
<t6109>I also never thought of him as a human being.</t6109> <t6110>A person who also played with dirt like me.</t6110> <t6111>A person who also knew how to love like me.</t6111> <t6112>A person whose connections were all severed, who couldn't feel the roots of his grass reaching into the earth, a person who had cracked open.</t6112> <t6113>Like me. "Yeah," I said after a while and turned back to continue digging.</t6113> <t6114>"To me, he was always just a corpse."</t6114>
<t6115>“I wish we had done something worthwhile,” she said.</t6115> <t6116>“I wish we had shown how heroic we are.”</t6116>
<t6117>"Yeah," I replied.</t6117> <t6118>"I wish we could tell him that no matter what happens, it doesn't necessarily have to be the end of the world."</t6118>
<t6119>"Yes, in the end, something did kill you."</t6119>
<t6120>I shrugged. "Yeah, I know.</t6120> <t6121>I'm not saying everything can live forever.</t6121> <t6122>It's just that, everything except the last thing." I dug my hands in again, the soil here was much darker than at home.</t6122> <t6123>I added another handful to the pile of dirt behind me, and sat down.</t6123> <t6124>I felt like I was on the verge of a thought, and I tried to delve deeper into it.</t6124> <t6125>I've never talked this much at once with Margo, considering our long and storied relationship.</t6125> <t6126>But here it was, my final game for her.</t6126>
<t6127>"When I think about the fact that he has died–to be honest, not very often–I always think like you said, that all the internal connections inside him have snapped."</t6127> <t6128>"But there are a thousand ways to look at it: maybe the connections snapped, maybe the ship sank, or maybe we are grass–our roots intertwined so closely that as long as someone is alive, no one is truly dead."</t6128> <t6129>"I mean, we are not short of metaphors."</t6129> <t6130>"But we have to be careful with the metaphors we choose to use, because it is very important."</t6130> <t6131>"If you choose the snapped connections, you are imagining a world where you can be irreparably severed."</t6131> <t6132>"If you choose grass, you are implying that we are all indefinitely connected, that we can use those roots not only to understand others but to become another person."</t6132> <t6133>"Metaphors carry multiple layers of meaning."</t6133> <t6134>"Do you understand what I mean?" She nodded.</t6134>
<t6135>"I like the connecting threads.</t6135> <t6136>I've always liked them.</t6136> <t6137>Because they are a way to feel.</t6137> <t6138>But the threads make the pain seem more likely to lead to death than it actually does, I think.</t6138> <t6139>We are not as fragile as the threads make us believe.</t6139> <t6140>And I also like grass.</t6140> <t6141>Grass brings me to you, helps me imagine you as a real person.</t6141> <t6142>But we are not different branches on the same tree.</t6142> <t6143>I cannot be you.</t6143> <t6144>You cannot be me.</t6144> <t6145>We can imagine others very accurately—but never relatively perfectly, you understand?</t6145>
<t6146>"Perhaps more like what you once said, we are all cracked open.</t6146> <t6147>As if each of us was initially a sealed ship's hull, impervious to water.</t6147> <t6148>And then things like this happen—people like this leave us, or don't love us, or don't understand us, or we don't understand them, we experience loss, failure, and we hurt each other.</t6148> <t6149>Then the hull begins to crack somewhere.</t6149> <t6150>And there, once the hull has cracked, the outcome is inevitable.</t6150> <t6151>Once the rain starts getting into the Osprey, there will never be any repair or restoration.</t6151> <t6152>But there is still this time in between, when the cracks are just beginning until we completely fall apart.</t6152> <t6153>And only during this time can we see each other, because we see ourselves through our own cracks and see others through their cracks.</t6153> <t6154>When have we ever looked directly at each other, face to face?</t6154> <t6155>Only when you look through my cracks and I look through yours.</t6155> <t6156>Before that, we only saw ideas of each other, like looking through a window but never seeing inside.</t6156> <t6157>But once the cracks have opened, light can come in.</t6157> <t6158>Light can shine out."</t6158>
<t6159>Margo placed her fingers on her lips, looking as if she was concentrating, or as if she was hiding her lips from me, or as if she was feeling the words she wanted to say.</t6159> <t6160>"You really are something," Margo finally said.</t6160> <t6161>She looked at me intently, my eyes and her eyes and nothing between them.</t6161> <t6162>I would gain nothing by kissing her.</t6162> <t6163>But I was no longer looking for things to gain.</t6163> <t6164>"There's something I need to do," I said, and she nodded very slightly, as if she already knew, and I kissed her.</t6164>
<t6165>We parted ways for a long time before Margo finally said, "You could come to New York. It would be fun.</t6165> <t6166>Like kissing."</t6166>
<t6167>And I said, "Kissing is really something."</t6167>
<t6168>And she said, "You are refusing.</t6168><t6169>"</t6169>
<t6170>I said, "Margo, I have my whole life here, I'm not you, and I–" But I couldn't say anything more because Margo kissed me again, and the moment she placed her lips on mine, I knew without needing to ask any questions, that we were heading in different directions.</t6170> <t6171>She stood up and went back to where we had just been sleeping, and grabbed her backpack.</t6171> <t6172>Margo took out a black leather-bound notebook, returned to the grave, and placed the notebook into the ground.</t6172>
<t6173>"I'll miss you," Margo whispered.</t6173> <t6174>I didn't know if she was talking to me or to the notebook.</t6174> <t6175>I also didn't know who I was talking to when I said, "Me too."</t6175>
<t6176>"Rest in peace, Mr. Robert Joyner," I said, dropping a handful of soil onto the notebook.</t6176>
<t6177>"Be at peace, naive and brave Quentin Jacobsen," Margo said, releasing the handful of earth she had just dug up.</t6177>
<t6178>Another handful, I said, "Be at peace, Miss Margo Roth Spiegelman of Orlando, never one to back down."</t6178>
<t6179>And one more handful, Margo said, "Rest in peace, super dog Myrna Mountweazel." We covered the notebook with soil, leveling it with the dug-up ground.</t6179> <t6180>The grass will soon grow back.</t6180> <t6181>To us, the grass will be the untrimmed hair of the grave.</t6181>
<t6182>We held hands, our feet dirty, and walked towards Agloe General Store.</t6182> <t6183>I helped Margo carry her luggage—a bundle of clothes, personal hygiene items, and an office chair—to her car.</t6183> <t6184>The preciousness of the moment often makes people speak easily to each other, but now it was just harder to find the words.</t6184>
<t6185>We stood outside in the parking lot of a one-story motel, when we could no longer avoid the goodbyes.</t6185> <t6186>“I'll buy a cell phone, and I'll call you,” Margo said.</t6186> <t6187>“And email too.</t6187> <t6188>And post mysterious comments on the discussion section of the article about Paper Towns in the Everything Encyclopedia.”</t6188>
<t6189>I smiled.</t6189> <t6190>"I'll send you an email when we get home," I said, "and I'll be waiting for your reply."</t6190>
<t6191>"I assure you.</t6191> <t6192>And I will see you again.</t6192> <t6193>We are not done with our meetings here yet."</t6193>
<t6194>"At the end of summer, maybe, I could meet you somewhere before school starts," I said.</t6194>
<t6195>"Yes," Margo replied. "Good idea."</t6195> <t6196>I smiled and nodded.</t6196> <t6197>She turned away, and I was wondering if Margo really thought so, when I saw her shoulders shaking.</t6197> <t6198>Margo was crying.</t6198>
<t6199>"I will see you again.</t6199> <t6200>In the meantime, I will write to you," I said.</t6200>
<t6201>"Alright, see you," she said without turning back, her voice lowering.</t6201> <t6202>"I'll write to you too."</t6202>
<t6203>It was precisely speaking these things that kept us from falling apart.</t6203> <t6204>And perhaps by imagining those futures, we could make them come true.</t6204> <t6205>Or maybe not.</t6205> <t6206>But in either case, we still had to imagine them.</t6206> <t6207>Light surged out and flowed in.</t6207>
<t6208>I stand in this parking lot, realizing that I have never been this far from home, and here is the girl I love but cannot follow.</t6208> <t6209>I hope this is a trivial matter for a hero, because not following her is the hardest thing I have ever done.</t6209>
<t6210>I kept thinking Margo would get into the car, but no, in the end, Margo turned back, and I saw her eyes, glistening with tears.</t6210> <t6211>The physical distance between us disappeared.</t6211> <t6212>We played the broken strings on our harp once again.</t6212>
<t6213>I felt Margo's hand on my back.</t6213> <t6214>It had already turned dark when I kissed her, but I opened my eyes and so did Margo.</t6214> <t6215>She was close enough for me to see her, as there was now an invisible light from within, even in the evening in this parking lot on the outskirts of Agloe.</t6215> <t6216>The kiss ended, we pressed our foreheads together and looked at each other.</t6216> <t6217>Yes, I could see her almost perfectly in this fractured darkness.</t6217>

<t6220>I know about paper towns because I passed through such a place on a road trip during my college years.</t6220> <t6221>My travel companion and I kept driving back and forth over a gap on the highway in South Dakota, looking for a city that the map confirmed existed—as I recall, that city was Holen. Finally, we stopped in front of a house, knocked on the door to ask for directions.</t6221> <t6222>The friendly woman in the house said she had answered this question many times before.</t6222> <t6223>She explained that the city we were looking for only existed on the map.</t6223>
<t6224>The story of Agloe, New York—as sketched out in this book—is almost true.</t6224> <t6225>Initially, Agloe was a paper town, created to protect mapmakers from copyright infringement.</t6225> <t6226>But then people using old maps from the Esso company kept searching for that city, and someone set up a store, making Agloe real.</t6226> <t6227>Mapmaking has changed a lot since Otto G. Lindberg and Ernest Alpers invented Agloe.</t6227> <t6228>But many mapmakers still add paper towns to their maps, creating copyright traps, as my tangled experience in South Dakota has verified.</t6228>
<t6229>The store that used to be Agloe is no longer there.</t6229> <t6230>But I believe that if we put it back on the map, eventually someone will rebuild it.</t6230>
