<t0>CHAPTER 1</t0>
<t1>Jonathan Harker's Diary (Shorthand)</t1>
<t2>• Bistritz, May 3</t2>
<t3>Left Munich at 8 PM on May 1st; arrived in Vienna early the next morning.</t3> <t4>We were supposed to arrive at 6:50, but the train was delayed by an hour.</t4> <t5>And during the continued journey to Budapest, as imagined from what was witnessed while sitting on the train, and from what was admired in a few streets during a walk when the train temporarily stopped, I found this to be a beautiful city.</t5>
<t6>But because I was very afraid of going too far from the station, as even if we were late, we still had to continue our departure as planned...</t6> <t7>I had a very clear impression of the journey leaving the West to reach the world of the East. After the train glided over the beautiful bridges with exemplary Western architecture spanning the wide and deep Danube river here, we immediately wandered into a region rich in Turkish customs.</t7>
<t8>Leaving Budapest not too late, we arrived in Klausenburgh by early evening.</t8> <t9>Here, I had to stay overnight at the Royal Hotel.</t9> <t10>They served me dinner, or rather a soup, a young chicken cooked with red pepper, quite tasty, but it would definitely make you very thirsty! (I thought about this dish from Mina's perspective). The waiter told me it was paprika hendi, a traditional dish that I could find everywhere in the Carpathian region.</t10> <t11>My basic knowledge of German proved to be quite useful, because honestly, if I didn't know any, I wouldn't have known how to manage.</t11>
<t12>In London, during my free time, I often went to the British Museum or the National Library to look up geographical maps and books about Transylvania.</t12><t13>I found it quite interesting to know a little about this place because I was about to have a business deal with a gentleman there.</t13><t14>The land that this gentleman mentioned in his letter to me is located in the eastern part of the country, at the border of three regions: Transylvania, Moldavia, and Bukovina, in the Carpathian Mountains.</t14><t15>This is one of the least known and most wild regions of Europe.</t15><t16>But no book or map could show me the exact location of the castle named Count Dracula, as there is still no detailed map of this place.</t16><t17>However, my research did inform me that Bistritz - the place Count Dracula mentioned to me and where I would have to travel by carriage - is a small, ancient city known to many people.</t17><t18>I will recount my unforgettable impressions.</t18><t19>That will revive a memory when recalling the excursions with Mina.</t19>
<t20>There are four races living in Transylvania: in the south are the Saxons living mixed with the Wallachians, who originate from the Dacian ethnicity; in the west are the Magyars; and in the east and north are the Szekelys. I will stay with the Szekelys. It is said that they descend from Attila and are the descendants of the Huns.</t20> <t21>This might be true because in the twelfth century, when the Magyars conquered the land they now inhabit, the Huns had already settled there.</t21> <t22>It seems that all the superstitions in the world exist in the Carpathians, and they always stir the imagination of the local people.</t22> <t23>If this is indeed the case, then my stay in this land will surely be very interesting.</t23> <t24>(I will certainly always bother the count with questions about these superstitious beliefs).</t24>
<t25>The first night I couldn't sleep soundly, not because of the unfamiliar house and surroundings, but because I had strange dreams.</t25> <t26>Throughout the night, I always felt like there was a wolf howling loudly right below my window: was it due to my insomnia or the paprika dish? Because I had drained the water bottle in the room and still had a burning thirst.</t26> <t27>But eventually, I fell into a deep sleep when it was nearing dawn, as I was awakened by the sound of knocking, and it seemed the person knocking had to do so for a very long time.</t27> <t28>At breakfast, they served me paprika again, a bit of oatmeal made from cornmeal which they called mamaliga, and a few bowls of stuffed pastries - a delicious dish named impletata.</t28> <t29>(I noted down the recipe for Mina). I ate hastily, as the train was supposed to depart a few minutes before eight; to be precise, it was supposed to leave at a few minutes to eight, yet after a breathless sprint to the station at seven-thirty, I still had to wait over an hour in the carriage before the train started moving.</t29> <t30>I have a feeling that the farther east we go, the later the trains run.</t30> <t31>I wonder how things are in China?</t31>
<t32>All day long, our train traveled through a beautiful and diverse land.</t32> <t33>At times, we admired small cities with castles perched precariously on steep hills, reminiscent of scenes described in ancient Biblical texts; at other times, the train ran alongside large and small streams with rocky, winding banks resembling nature's own railings.</t33> <t34>At the stations where we stopped, every platform was bustling with crowds dressed in vibrant, colorful attire of various kinds.</t34> <t35>Some people looked very similar to the farmers in our country or in France and Germany: they wore simple mesh shirts with rather wide-cut trousers and round-brimmed hats; but others were dressed in more colorful outfits.</t35>
<t36>The women here seem very healthy and quite beautiful if you don't look at them too closely.</t36><t37>They all wear oversized white-sleeved shirts, with leather belts that are always fluttering over their splendid skirts.</t37><t38>However, I find the Slovakians to be the most peculiar; they wear wide-brimmed cowboy-style hats, baggy pants in a dull color, white linen shirts, and wide leather belts studded with brass rivets.</t38><t39>Particularly, every man likes to tuck his pants into a pair of long boots.</t39><t40>Their long black hair and thick beards make them look more distinctive but not at all charming.</t40><t41>Honestly, if I were traveling by horse-drawn carriage, I might have mistaken them for a band of highway robbers, although I have been told that they have never done anything bad to anyone; on the contrary, they are always quite cowardly.</t41>
<t42>We arrived in Bistritz at midnight.</t42> <t43>As I mentioned, Bistritz is an ancient city with a unique past.</t43> <t44>Located near the border - indeed, when leaving Bistritz, just crossing the Borgo Pass leads to Bukovina - this city has experienced numerous ups and downs, many of which are still evident today.</t44>
<t45>Fifty years ago, terrifying fires continuously occurred, flattening everything.</t45> <t46>At the beginning of the seventeenth century, this city also had to withstand a siege for three weeks, resulting in thirteen thousand deaths, not to mention the victims of famine and disease.</t46>
<t47>Count Dracula arranged for me to stay at the Golden Crown Hotel.</t47> <t48>I was very pleased to see that it was a very ancient house, because after all, I wanted to understand as much as possible about the customs and traditions of this land.</t48> <t49>Someone was waiting for me at the door: it was a middle-aged woman with a radiant face, dressed in the typical local peasant style.</t49> <t50>She bowed deeply to greet me and asked:</t50>
<t51>— Are you an Englishman?</t51>
<t52>— Yes, - I replied - I am Jonathan Harker.</t52>
<t53>The woman smiled and said something to a shirtless man standing behind her.</t53> <t54>The man immediately disappeared but then quickly returned with a letter for me.</t54> <t55>The letter read as follows:</t55>
<t56>“Dear friend,</t56>
<t57>Welcome to the Carpathians.</t57> <t58>I have been eagerly awaiting you.</t58>
<t59>Wish you a good night's sleep tonight.</t59> <t60>The carriage trip to Bukovina tomorrow afternoon will start at three o'clock, your seat has been reserved.</t60> <t61>My carriage will be waiting to pick you up at the Borgo Pass.</t61> <t62>Hope that from London, your journey will be smooth, and you will feel truly comfortable during your days in our beautiful country.</t62>
<t63>Warm regards!</t63>
<t64>"Dracula."</t64>
<t65>• May 4</t65>
<t66>The hotel owner himself also received a letter from the count with a request to reserve the best seat on the carriage for me, but when I asked a few questions, the owner seemed hesitant and used the excuse that he couldn't fully understand the German I spoke; clearly a lie because when I first arrived at the hotel, he understood everything I said.</t66> <t67>The hotel owner and his wife looked at each other worriedly, then turned to me and stammered that the carriage fare had been sent in advance along with a letter, and they knew nothing more.</t67> <t68>When I asked about Count Dracula and his castle, both the husband and wife made the sign of the cross and replied that they knew absolutely nothing, then signaled to me that they did not want to talk about it anymore.</t68> <t69>Since the departure time had arrived, I had no more time to inquire with others.</t69> <t70>I found the situation very mysterious and unconvincing.</t70>
<t71>Just as I was about to set off, the landlady suddenly rushed into the room and asked me in a panicked voice:</t71>
<t72>— Are you really planning to go there?</t72> <t73>Oh! Young man, are you really planning to go there?</t73>
<t74>The woman was so panic-stricken that she stammered for a long time before she could say a few words in German that she knew, mixed with some sounds completely unfamiliar to me.</t74> <t75>When I replied that I had to leave immediately to attend to an important matter, she asked me again:</t75>
<t76>— Do you know what day it is today?</t76>
<t77>I replied on May 4th.</t77>
<t78>— Yes, of course, it's May 4th.</t78> <t79>But what day is it?</t79>
<t80>When I said I didn't fully understand the question, she then explained:</t80>
<t81>— Is it the day before Saint George's Day?</t81> <t82>Could you have forgotten that tonight, exactly at the stroke of midnight, all the charms will rule the earth as absolute lords?</t82> <t83>Do you not know where you are going and what you are about to face?</t83>
<t84>The woman was so terrified that I tried every way to comfort her, but it was in vain.</t84> <t85>Finally, she suddenly knelt down and begged me not to go, or if I had to go, to stay for another day or two.</t85> <t86>This strange behavior made me feel a bit uneasy.</t86> <t87>But in any case, people were waiting for me at the castle, and nothing could stop me from going there.</t87> <t88>I helped the hostess up, but no matter what, I still had to set off.</t88> <t89>The woman stood up, wiped her tears, then took off the cross she wore around her neck and handed it to me. It would be disrespectful to refuse the gift from an elderly woman who wished me well and was genuinely worried for me.</t89> <t90>The hostess gently placed the cross around my neck and said simply, "For the love of your mother," then left the room.</t90>
<t91>I am writing these diary lines while waiting for the horse-drawn carriage - of course, it is late again - and the cross is still dangling around my neck.</t91> <t92>Is it fear, dreadful beliefs, or this small cross itself that has tormented that elderly woman?</t92> <t93>Honestly, I don't know, but surely my feelings about what just happened will be less pleasant than usual.</t93>
<t94>• May 5. At the castle</t94>
<t95>The grayish-blue color of the early morning is gradually fading, giving way to the fresh pink of the sun.</t95> <t96>The horizon seems to be cut into pieces by clusters of trees or hills or something that I can't quite make out, because all the scenery, big and small, is far away and blends into each other.</t96> <t97>At this moment, I no longer feel sleepy; tomorrow I will have plenty of free time, I can wake up whenever I want, and I will write until I get sleepy, because I have many strange things to write about.</t97> <t98>Before leaving Bistritz, I had a satisfying and delicious meal.</t98> <t99>The hotel served me a dish they called "robber steak" - which is a few pieces of leaf lard mixed with onions, beef, and paprika, all rolled around small sticks and grilled over a fire.</t99> <t100>I drank a type of golden Mediasch, a kind of wine that can burn your tongue, but to me, it was not unpleasant.</t100> <t101>However, I could only drink two glasses.</t101>
<t102>When I got into the carriage, I saw that the coachman had not yet taken his seat; he was still busy talking to the hotel owner.</t102> <t103>There was no doubt that they were talking about me, because every now and then they would turn to look at me.</t103>
<t104>The people sitting in the rows near the hotel door also began to stand up and come closer to listen to the two men talking; occasionally, they would turn back to look at me with eyes that held something akin to pity.</t104> <t105>As for myself, sometimes I could catch a few words from the crowd, but they were all words I didn't understand.</t105> <t106>Moreover, they spoke in many different languages.</t106> <t107>Therefore, I had to take out the multilingual dictionary from my travel bag to look up the meanings of all the strange words I had overheard.</t107> <t108>But to be honest, none of the meanings I found in the dictionary gave me any courage, because I only found words like: Ordog - Satan; Pokol - hell; stregocia - witch; vrolok and vlkoslak - something like "vampire" or "werewolf" according to the meanings in two dialects.</t108>
<t109>When the carriage was about to start moving, the crowd in front of the hotel grew larger and larger, all making the sign of the cross and pointing their index and middle fingers towards me. It was not easy when I asked a fellow traveler about the meaning of those strange gestures: "They want to protect you," he explained, "against evil eyes."</t109><t110>Honestly, once again, I did not feel comfortable before arriving at an unfamiliar place.</t110><t111>But on the other hand, I also had to admit a fact that all those people, both men and women, showed a kindness towards me, wanting to share with me the misfortune they believed would happen.</t111><t112>And no matter what, I will never forget these touching images.</t112><t113>The coachman, wearing wide-legged pants that almost covered the seat he was sitting on, swung his whip above the heads of the four horses already harnessed.</t113><t114>We began our journey.</t114>
<t115>The beauty of the scenery along the way quickly made me forget my worries and anxieties, but I don't think I could have easily shed all my obsessions if I had understood the whole story of my fellow travelers.</t115> <t116>In front of us were vast forests, with steep hills occasionally rising on either side of the road, topped with a solitary clump of trees or a sparse farm casting shadows onto the path.</t116> <t117>Everywhere, trees were in full bloom - apple blossoms, plum blossoms, pear blossoms, and cherry blossoms, all creating a truly magnificent picture; and even the grassy carpets in the orchards we passed through, under the sunlight, were sparkling with fallen petals.</t117> <t118>Whether winding around or stretching up the hills, the road always seemed like a soft silk fabric lying exposed on the lush green velvet grass, or peeking out from under a forest of pines extending as far as the eye could see, making me feel as if I were lost in a fairyland.</t118> <t119>However, the farther we went, the worse the road became, but the coachman still urged the horses to run at full speed.</t119> <t120>This surprised me greatly.</t120> <t121>It seemed he wanted to reach Borgo Prund as quickly as possible.</t121>
<t122>Before setting off, I was told that the road was excellent, but it clearly hasn't returned to that state after the recent winter snowfalls.</t122> <t123>This road is unlike the other roads in the Carpathian Mountains: indeed, no one dares to repair it, fearing that doing so would make the Turks mistakenly believe that preparations for an invasion of their country are underway, which would immediately serve as a pretext for them to declare war. In fact, in this mountainous region, war is always on the brink of breaking out.</t123>
<t124>On the other side of the hills, there are still forests and the towering peaks of the Carpathian range.</t124> <t125>In front of us, everywhere we look, there are forests and mountains.</t125> <t126>The shimmering, radiant evening sunlight turns the crevices between the towering cliffs into a deep blue or purple, transforms the grass patches covering the rock edges into a brownish green, and the endless panoramic view of jagged, sharp peaks fading into the horizon, where the snow-capped mountains undulate. As the sun began to set, we suddenly noticed here and there, scattered among the large and small rock crevices, waterfalls cascading down in countless silver streams.</t126>
<t127>The horse-drawn carriage diligently continued its seemingly endless journey.</t127><t128>Behind us, the sun gradually sank below the horizon, and the shadows of dusk descended ever more quickly.</t128><t129>The sense of sunset became even more vivid when we were at a higher altitude.</t129><t130>The snow-capped mountain peaks still sparkled with the scattered pink rays of the sun.</t130><t131>Occasionally along the way, we encountered groups of Czechs and Slovaks in their famous traditional costumes.</t131><t132>However, there was one thing that made me unhappy: most of them suffered from goiters.</t132><t133>Every now and then, a solitary cross would stand by the roadside, and each time the carriage passed by, the passengers would hurriedly make the sign of the cross.</t133><t134>We also saw farmers kneeling in prayer in front of graveyard chapels.</t134><t135>They were so absorbed in their prayers that they didn't bother to look up when they heard the carriage approaching.</t135><t136>All of them were devout, and while praying, they never paid attention to the world around them.</t136><t137>Almost everything was new to me: the haystacks piled high up to the tree canopies, the weeping willows revealing through their leaves slender branches glistening with silver light...</t137><t138>Occasionally, I encountered an ox cart carrying farmers returning home, the Czech men wearing pure white sheepskin coats; while the Slovaks wore dyed sheepskin coats, and they carried long axes like spears by their sides.</t138><t139>Nightfall heralded a scene of icy coldness, the darkness deepening among the dense fir and oak leaves.</t139><t140>We were on our way to the Borgo Pass.</t140><t141>In the valley beneath us, the black fir trees seemed to be torn apart against a backdrop of freshly fallen white snow.</t141><t142>Sometimes, as the road delved into a fir forest - which seemed to be swallowing us whole - thick, white fog banks would suddenly appear, completely obscuring the bushes, making them look like ghostly apparitions.</t142><t143>Once again, I felt a shiver similar to the tingling sensation I had experienced at dusk.</t143><t144>In the Carpathians, the setting sun had left behind bizarrely shaped clouds drifting among the rocky crags.</t144><t145>The hillsides were now so steep that, despite being in a hurry to reach our destination, the coachman had to slow the horses down.</t145><t146>I expressed my desire to get off and walk for a bit, as I would do back home in a similar situation, but the coachman immediately objected:</t146>
<t147>— No, no! - He replied. - You can't walk there...</t147> <t148>Are the dogs here fierce?</t148>
<t149>The coachman added another sentence, which I guessed was his attempt to prove that he too had a sense of humor, as I could clearly see him glancing at each passenger, hoping for a responsive smile:</t149>
<t150>— Just trust me, and you will have everything, including the walk, when you are comfortably lying in bed tonight.</t150>
<t151>He only kept quiet when it was time to light the lamps on the carriage.</t151> <t152>As soon as the lamps were lit, the passengers suddenly became lively, urging the coachman to drive the horses faster.</t152> <t153>The coachman immediately swung his whip, urging the horses to gallop up the mountainside.</t153> <t154>After the carriage had been running for a while, I believed I saw a pale blue light in the darkness ahead - but it was probably nothing more than a crack between the rocks.</t154> <t155>My fellow travelers became increasingly agitated.</t155> <t156>The carriage began to roll wildly, causing the springs to creak, making us feel as if we were on a boat in a stormy sea.</t156> <t157>I had to hold tightly to the side of the carriage to avoid being thrown off.</t157> <t158>After a while, the road seemed smoother, and I felt as if the carriage was flying through the night.</t158> <t159>The path also became narrower, the mountains closed in more tightly, and to be honest, it seemed as if they were spreading out to threaten us: we were passing through the Borgo Pass.</t159> <t160>For some reason, my fellow travelers began handing me various items as gifts, such as a sprig of garlic, a dried wild rose... and I realized I couldn't refuse them.</t160> <t161>Indeed, each gift had a certain amusing quality, yet those who gave them to me expressed sincere and simple intentions along with mysterious gestures, similar to those made by the people standing in front of the Bistritz hotel: making the sign of the cross and raising two fingers to protect me against the evil eyes lurking around.</t161> <t162>The coachman leaned forward, and the passengers on the benches strained their necks to look outside.</t162> <t163>Clearly, they were expecting something to appear in the night.</t163>
<t164>I asked questions, but no one wanted to answer, not even a single sentence.</t164> <t165>The curiosity kept smoldering within me.</t165> <t166>Finally, we reached the eastern slope of Borgo Pass.</t166> <t167>Dark clouds piled up, the air stifling as if a storm was imminent.</t167> <t168>It must be said that the atmosphere between the two mountain slopes was distinctly different.</t168> <t169>Now we were entering a dangerous area.</t169> <t170>I quietly observed the carriage tasked with leading me to the Count's house, anxiously waiting for the moment to catch a glimpse of the faint light from the castle, but everything around was still pitch black.</t170> <t171>The only light at that moment was the flickering light from the carriage, mingling with the heavy, steamy breaths of the horses.</t171> <t172>That light allowed us to see the pale road ahead, but there was absolutely no sign of any other vehicle besides ours.</t172> <t173>My fellow travelers let out a sigh and then turned to find a more comfortable sitting position.</t173> <t174>I felt their gestures were like a mockery: they were ridiculing my disappointment.</t174> <t175>I was thinking of how to handle this awkward situation when the coachman suddenly checked his watch and said something to the passengers that I didn't understand; however, I could guess his meaning: "An hour late..."</t175> <t176>Then he turned to advise me in German that was even worse than mine:</t176>
<t177>— I don't see any car, they probably aren't waiting for you.</t177> <t178>Perhaps you should come with us to Bukovina, you can return here tomorrow or the day after... that would be better...</t178>
<t179>Just as the coachman was about to finish his sentence, the horses suddenly neighed loudly and stomped the ground frantically. Several people sitting near me were startled, cried out in fear, and hastily made the sign of the cross: it turned out to be a convertible horse-drawn carriage, pulled by four horses, that had suddenly appeared behind us and then overtook us to stop right next to our carriage.</t179> <t180>Under the light, I saw that the newly arrived horses were all sleek, including one that was as black as coal.</t180> <t181>The driver was a tall man with a long, reddish beard like corn silk, wearing a wide-brimmed black hat that covered his face.</t181> <t182>In the flickering light, I could still make out the sparkle in his eyes.</t182> <t183>Those eyes were almost red in color.</t183>
<t184>— You arrived too early, my friend! - He said to our coachman.</t184>
<t185>The coachman replied in an uncertain voice:</t185>
<t186>— But this English gentleman here is very...</t186>
<t187>— That must be the reason why I think - The newcomer continued - that you intend to take him all the way to Bukovina...</t187> <t188>No, my friend, you can't fool me.</t188> <t189>I know everything, and my horses run very fast too...</t189>
<t190>He laughed and talked, but his face remained stern - at this moment he was standing very close to our car.</t190> <t191>I could see very clearly his blood-red lips, his sharp, yellowish ivory-like teeth.</t191> <t192>A passenger whispered into the ear of the person sitting next to them the famous poem Lenore by Burger: Denn die todten reiten schnell...[3]</t192>
<t193>Surely the newcomer had heard the poem, because I saw him turn to look at the passenger with a grotesque smile.</t193> <t194>The passenger hurriedly turned his face away, made the sign of the cross, and held out two fingers.</t194>
<t195>— Please give me your luggage, sir.</t195> <t196>- The stranger continued to speak.</t196>
<t197>Without needing him to say so, my pile of suitcases was also transferred to the convertible car.</t197> <t198>I stepped out of the car and moved to sit in the new car.</t198> <t199>The man gave me a hand - his hand was indeed as hard as steel.</t199> <t200>He must have extraordinary strength.</t200> <t201>Without a word, he jerked the reins to turn the car halfway around.</t201> <t202>The new car began to move and sped at full speed on the Borgo Pass.</t202> <t203>Looking back, I could still make out the flickering lights of the passenger car faintly illuminating the misty breath of the horses; the silhouettes of the passengers, who had just recently been my companions, appeared one last time before my eyes: they were making the sign of the cross together.</t203>
<t204>The coachman suddenly swung the whip forcefully, and the horses immediately turned onto the road to Bukovina.</t204> <t205>As the horses delved deeper into the night, I suddenly shivered with a dreadful sense of loneliness, but immediately a cloak was draped over my shoulders, followed by a travel blanket gently placed over my knees.</t205> <t206>The man spoke to me in perfect German:</t206>
<t207>— Sir, the weather is a bit bad, so the count, that is, my master, has ordered me not to let you catch a cold.</t207> <t208>The bottle of slivovitz[4] is over there, right under that seat, feel free to help yourself if you like.</t208>
<t209>Even without drinking a drop, just knowing that there is such a bottle in the car is enough to comfort me.</t209> <t210>However, my anxiety is far from being calmed, if not to say that I am falling into an opposite state of mind.</t210> <t211>I believe that if I could, I would definitely abandon this increasingly mysterious journey.</t211>
<t212>Speeding faster and faster down the road, the car suddenly swerved onto another road and then continued straight.</t212><t213>I had the feeling that the car was looping around the same place over and over.</t213><t214>I came up with the idea of trying to find some landmark to confirm my suspicion, and I realized that I was not mistaken.</t214><t215>I intended to ask the driver what was going on but then decided against it, telling myself that in such a vulnerable situation, silence was the better option. Who knows, I might inadvertently oppose something if he was ordered to prolong the journey!</t215><t216>Anyway, I wanted to check the time, and the only way to see the hour was to strike a match.</t216><t217>It was almost midnight.</t217><t218>I suddenly shivered with fear: surely the superstitions about everything that happens at midnight would haunt my mind again after the strange events I had experienced.</t218><t219>What was going to happen next?</t219>
<t220>The sudden sound of a dog barking echoed from somewhere down the road, perhaps from a farmyard; a fearful, prolonged bark...</t220> <t221>That bark was answered by another dog, then another, and yet another...</t221> <t222>Until it was swept away by the gusts of wind blowing fiercely through the pass.</t222> <t223>Those wild and mournful cries suddenly seemed to rise from every corner.</t223> <t224>The savage resonance echoed on and on, far into the depths of a ghostly world that an imagination could conjure up in the night...</t224> <t225>The horses immediately reared up, but the man calmed them down with a gentle voice, though each one was drenched in sweat and trembling like a leaf.</t225> <t226>At this moment, the furthest mountains were echoing back to us more haunting, more intense, and exponentially stronger howls: wolves.</t226> <t227>I thought I might jump out of the carriage and run away.</t227> <t228>The horses once again reared up and kicked wildly, but the coachman didn't need to exert much effort to keep them from bolting.</t228> <t229>He jumped down from the carriage and ran to the front of the horses to soothe, pat, and comfort them with the kindest words he had.</t229> <t230>The result was extraordinary: though still trembling, the four horses immediately obeyed their master, allowing him to get back on the carriage and take the reins.</t230> <t231>They hurriedly sped along the unavoidable road once more.</t231> <t232>This time, after crossing the pass, the coachman directed the horses along a different path, down a narrower road that disappeared to the right.</t232>
<t233>Moments later, our car found itself between two rows of trees that intertwined at certain points to form a real arch, making me feel like we were entering a tunnel.</t233> <t234>Occasionally, we encountered massive rock formations that loomed like towering shadows, threatening passersby.</t234> <t235>And every time a gust of wind roared through the crevices in the rocks, the treetops would shake violently.</t235> <t236>The weather grew colder by the moment, and delicate snowflakes began to fall, soon turning everything around us into a blanket of white.</t236> <t237>The wind still carried the mournful, sorrowful howls of the house dogs to us, but those sounds gradually faded as we had traveled quite a distance.</t237>
<t238>But on the contrary, the wolf howls that were previously faint now suddenly became more intense, more urgent; those mournful howls grew closer and seemed to be surrounding us. To be honest, I began to feel terrified.</t238>
<t239>It seems that the horses also have an uneasy look like me.</t239> <t240>However, the man still calmly looked around as if nothing had happened.</t240> <t241>I strained my eyes to distinguish something in the night, but everything was still just a pitch-black color.</t241>
<t242>I suddenly jolted when I noticed a bright green light flickering some distance to the left of our car.</t242> <t243>The coachman must have noticed the light at the same time as I did, because he abruptly pulled the reins to stop the horse, then jumped down and disappeared into the night.</t243> <t244>I stood there, dazed, wondering what I should do...</t244> <t245>The howling of wolves grew closer to our car.</t245> <t246>While I was still hesitating, the man suddenly reappeared in front of me, said nothing, and quickly climbed back onto the seat to urge the horse onward.</t246> <t247>That light kept haunting my mind, and it seemed like I could see it flickering again and again.</t247>
<t248>Yes, later when I think back, I still have the feeling that I fell into a terrifying nightmare.</t248>
<t249>After a while, that greenish spot appeared so close to us that in the deep darkness, I could clearly see every gesture of the coachman.</t249> <t250>He quickly stepped towards the flickering light - though it was a very weak light, just enough to distinguish the surrounding ground - and then picked up some stones and piled them into a heap.</t250> <t251>I found his actions very strange.</t251> <t252>Another time, when that dim halo appeared: standing between the light and me, he didn't bother to block my view anymore.</t252> <t253>I continued to clearly see that flickering and mysterious light.</t253> <t254>I was stunned for a moment, but then told myself that my eyes had deceived me because I wanted so badly to pierce through the darkness...</t254> <t255>After that, we no longer saw those greenish spots, but the sound of wolves remained, as if they were forming a circle that was gradually closing in, tightening around our carriage.</t255>
<t256>I don't understand why the coachman jumped off the carriage once again, and this time he went even farther away.</t256> <t257>While he was absent, the horses began to panic more than ever before, snorting and neighing loudly.</t257> <t258>I couldn't understand what made them so frightened, because at that moment, the moon suddenly appeared, flickering among the dark clouds, behind a majestic and jagged mountain peak, and the howling of the wolves abruptly ceased.</t258> <t259>Under the pale moonlight, I trembled as I realized that wolves had suddenly appeared out of nowhere, surrounding the carriage, baring their white teeth and red tongues; their fur bristling like porcupine quills.</t259> <t260>In the eerily silent night, they looked even more terrifying than when they were howling a hundred times over.</t260>
<t261>I began to think of a danger that could strike at any moment.</t261> <t262>The fear had paralyzed my entire body.</t262> <t263>The pack of wolves suddenly howled as if the moonlight had some special power over them.</t263> <t264>The horses could no longer remain calm.</t264> <t265>They glanced around furtively as if seeking some kind of pity, but the circle of life, the terrifying circle, still tightly surrounded them.</t265> <t266>I called the coachman, I shouted for him to turn back.</t266> <t267>I felt that my only remaining chance was to try to break through the eerie encirclement so that he could turn back.</t267> <t268>Therefore, I shouted even louder and pounded on the carriage door with the hope of scaring away the wolves lurking nearby.</t268>
<t269>How he ended up there, I do not know, I only know that when I heard his authoritative and powerful voice and looked in that direction, I saw him standing in the middle of the road.</t269> <t270>When his long arms made a gesture as if pushing back some invisible obstacle, the pack of wolves suddenly retreated.</t270> <t271>At that moment, the moon was completely covered by a massive black cloud.</t271> <t272>The sky became pitch black again.</t272> <t273>When my eyes gradually adjusted to the darkness, I realized the man was climbing into the vehicle, while the pack of wolves had completely disappeared.</t273> <t274>Everything happened so bizarrely and ominously that I did not dare to speak or make any movement.</t274> <t275>The moonlight did not reappear, and at that moment, the journey seemed to stretch on endlessly for me.</t275> <t276>We continued on our way.</t276> <t277>The road seemed to keep climbing endlessly, although occasionally the vehicle would suddenly plunge down short slopes, only to then rush up a new incline.</t277>
<t278>In a state of weariness and disappointment, I suddenly realized that the coachman had unexpectedly driven the carriage into the courtyard of a massive, dilapidated castle.</t278> <t279>The tall, dark windows did not emit a single ray of light, and the pitch-black arrow slits stood out even more against the sky, which was now pale with moonlight: the moon once again appeared, hovering among the heavy clouds.</t279>
<t280>CHAPTER 2</t280>
<t281>Jonathan Harker's Diary (continued)</t281>
<t282>• May 5</t282>
<t283>Perhaps I was dozing off, otherwise how could I have been startled by the scene in the ancient castle.</t283> <t284>In the dark night, the castle courtyard seemed to be more spacious; yes, with the intricate and dark pathways leading to the towering arches, the courtyard appeared even larger than it actually was.</t284>
<t285>The horse-drawn carriage came to a stop, ending an impressive journey. The coachman got down first and helped me down afterward.</t285> <t286>Once again, I felt an immense strength emanating from him.</t286> <t287>His hand was like a steel vise that could crush mine if he wanted to.</t287> <t288>Then, he took my luggage and placed it on the ground near where I was standing, which was close to a large, old door studded with iron nails, the doorframe built from large stones.</t288> <t289>Even though it was still very dark, I could make out the carvings on the stone, worn away significantly by time and the elements.</t289> <t290>After unloading all my luggage, the man jumped back onto the carriage, pulled the reins, and drove the horses away, disappearing into one of the dark narrow paths.</t290>
<t291>I stood still like a statue, not knowing what to do.</t291> <t292>There was no bell to ring, no knocker to call, and there was no way anyone would hear my call through those solid walls or from those pitch-black windows.</t292> <t293>All I could do was wait, and the waiting felt endless to me.</t293> <t294>Terror and anxiety once again overwhelmed my mind.</t294> <t295>So where had I come to, and what kind of people would I have to meet?</t295> <t296>Had I embarked on some bizarre adventure? Was what happened to me—a notary clerk coming here to resolve a real estate transaction near London—just an ordinary trouble in life?</t296> <t297>I rubbed my eyes and pinched myself all over to make sure I was still awake, because I thought I was having a nightmare before.</t297> <t298>I told myself that I would open my eyes and find myself at home, and then the dawn would gradually shine through my bedroom window: it wouldn't be the first night I fell into a restless sleep after an exhausting day. I was still awake!</t298> <t299>When I pinched myself, I still felt pain, my eyes had not deceived me at all! I was fully awake and standing in front of a castle in the Carpathians! The only thing left to do: patiently wait for a new day.</t299>
<t300>Lost in thought, I was suddenly startled by the sound of heavy footsteps behind the large door, at the same time a streak of light shone through the crack, followed by the clattering sound of chains being removed, and the creaking sound of the door latch being pulled.</t300> <t301>I also heard the key turning laboriously in the lock for quite a while (perhaps this lock hadn't been touched in a long time?) before the large door creaked open.</t301>
<t302>Standing in front of me was a tall old man, clean-shaven (except for a long white mustache), dressed entirely in black from head to toe, without a single speck of any other color, no matter how small.</t302> <t303>In his hand, he held an antique silver lamp without a glass cover, the flame flickering wildly in the air, casting trembling shadows all around.</t303> <t304>He invited me in with a very polite gesture and spoke to me in perfect English, though his voice sounded somewhat strange:</t304>
<t305>— Welcome, sir! Please make yourself at home!</t305>
<t306>The old man stood still like a statue, as if the first gesture he made to greet me had turned him into a block of stone.</t306> <t307>However, as I stepped over the threshold, he immediately grabbed my hand with such tremendous strength that my body trembled with pain.</t307> <t308>His hand was as cold as ice, resembling the hand of a corpse more than that of a living person.</t308> <t309>He repeated:</t309>
<t310>— Welcome to my place! Please make yourself at home, don't be afraid of anything, and leave behind a bit of the luck you've brought with you!</t310>
<t311>The strength of the old man's hand suddenly reminded me of the hand of the coachman whose face I had never clearly seen; I wondered if the person talking to me was him or someone else.</t311> <t312>I boldly asked:</t312>
<t313>— Count Dracula?</t313>
<t314>The old man politely leaned over and responded.</t314>
<t315>— Yes, I am Count Dracula, welcome to my abode, Mr. Harker. Please come in, come in.</t315> <t316>The night is a bit chilly.</t316> <t317>You must be in need of some rest and a little something to eat...</t317>
<t318>As he spoke, the old man placed the lamp on a protruding beam on the wall, then stepped out of the doorway to take my luggage before I could stop him.</t318> <t319>He carried it all into the hallway.</t319> <t320>I was about to open my mouth to complain when he hurriedly spoke in a continuous stream, giving me no chance to speak.</t320>
<t321>— Don't say anything, sir, you are my guest after all.</t321> <t322>It's late now, my servants have all gone to bed.</t322> <t323>Allow me to personally escort you to your room.</t323>
<t324>The host tried to emphasize his tone as if he wanted to carry my suitcase at all costs.</t324> <t325>He walked through the hallway, climbed up a spiral staircase, and then reached a corridor entirely paved with stone, making each step echo endlessly.</t325> <t326>At the end of the corridor, he pushed a heavy door, revealing a room that felt very comfortable to me at that moment: a room with lights, a table for eating soup, and a roaring fire burning in a grand fireplace.</t326>
<t327>Count Dracula placed my luggage down, closed the door, walked across the room, and went to another door that opened into a small octagonal room illuminated by a single lamp; I did not see any windows in it.</t327> <t328>The host walked across the room, unexpectedly opened another door, and invited me inside.</t328> <t329>Wow! What a pleasant scene! It was a spacious bedroom, brightly lit and also warmed by logs in the fireplace.</t329> <t330>It was clear that the fire had just been lit, but the fireplace was already burning very well.</t330> <t331>The Count brought my suitcase into this room and then withdrew.</t331> <t332>Before closing the door, he reminded me:</t332>
<t333>— After a tiring journey, you probably want to rest a bit and change into more comfortable clothes.</t333> <t334>I hope you will find everything you need here.</t334> <t335>When you're ready, you can go to the next room.</t335> <t336>Dinner is waiting for you.</t336>
<t337>The flickering firelight, the warm atmosphere, and the count's courteous demeanor seemed to have made me forget all my troubles.</t337> <t338>I suddenly realized I was starving.</t338> <t339>After a quick wash, I immediately went to the next room as the count had just invited me.</t339>
<t340>The dinner had been meticulously prepared.</t340> <t341>The host was standing leaning against the fireplace.</t341> <t342>Seeing me, he pointed to the table and said, in a very kind voice.</t342>
<t343>— Please, take a seat and enjoy your meal as you wish.</t343> <t344>I hope you will forgive me for not joining you, as I cannot eat anything more after having already had dinner.</t344>
<t345>I handed over the sealed letter that Mr. Hawkins had asked me to hold for him.</t345> <t346>He immediately opened the letter and read it with a very solemn expression.</t346> <t347>After reading, he smiled and returned the letter to me.</t347> <t348>There was a passage in the letter that made me feel truly happy:</t348>
<t349>“I am truly sorry that my gout has once again attacked me, preventing me from setting out at this time, and I fear that it will hold me back for a long period.</t349> <t350>However, I also feel fortunate to send you a representative whom I completely trust.</t350> <t351>He is a young man full of energy, thoroughly knowledgeable about the work.</t351> <t352>I must reiterate, we can rely on him.</t352> <t353>Moreover, he is a discreet person, and I can say that he has matured in my office.</t353> <t354>During his stay at your place, he will follow your arrangements whenever you need, and everything will be under your guidance...”</t354>
<t355>The count left the fireplace to personally lift the lid of a dish for me.</t355> <t356>A moment later, I tasted a roasted chicken that I considered a true delicacy.</t356> <t357>Additionally, there was some cheese, a plate of salad, and two glasses of aged Tokay wine.</t357> <t358>During the meal, the count asked a lot about my journey.</t358> <t359>I recounted one by one the strange events that had occurred along the way.</t359> <t360>The count seemed to listen very attentively.</t360>
<t361>By the time I finished telling the story, I had also finished my meal.</t361> <t362>The host told me to sit in an armchair near the fireplace and offered me a cigar, apologizing that he couldn't smoke with me.</t362> <t363>Indeed, this was the first occasion I could closely observe the man, and the prominent features on his face struck me.</t363>
<t364>The hooked nose gave him the appearance of a hawk; he had a high, prominent forehead, with sparse hair on the top but very thick around the head; his thick eyebrows almost met above the bridge of his nose, with long, tangled hairs that gave the impression of being tightly curled.</t364> <t365>His mouth, or at least what I could see beneath the large mustache, could not hide a certain cruel look; and his teeth, though very white, were all sharp and protruded beyond his bright red lips - indicating an extraordinary vitality for someone of his age.</t365> <t366>However, his ears were leaden gray and pointed like a mouse's; his broad chin also showed his strength; and his cheeks, though deeply sunken, still appeared very firm.</t366> <t367>A strangely pale greenish complexion, that was the overall impression his face left on me.</t367>
<t368>Of course, I also carefully observed the two hands resting on his knees.</t368> <t369>Under the flickering firelight, they appeared whiter and more delicate, but upon closer inspection, I saw the opposite: they looked coarse with short fingers like a bunch of stubby bananas.</t369> <t370>What astonished me the most was that the backs of his hands were covered with a layer of hair, and although the fingers were short, the nails were very long and slender, all sharply trimmed.</t370> <t371>When he leaned forward, I couldn't help but shudder.</t371> <t372>His breath had such a foul odor that it made me feel nauseous, and I couldn't hide it.</t372> <t373>The count must have noticed my discomfort because I saw him retract slightly and give a grotesque smile, baring his buck teeth.</t373> <t374>He returned to the fireplace.</t374> <t375>We remained silent for quite a long time.</t375> <t376>Involuntarily, I glanced up at the window: the first rays of dawn had appeared.</t376> <t377>The silent atmosphere seemed to weigh heavily on everything.</t377> <t378>However, when I listened carefully, I still had the impression that I could hear the distant howling of wolves in the valley.</t378> <t379>The host's eyes sparkled brightly, and he said to me:</t379>
<t380>— Do you hear anything?</t380> <t381>They are the children of the night...</t381> <t382>They are making a music!</t382>
<t383>As if he could read the surprise on my face, the old man continued:</t383>
<t384>— Ah! Sir!</t384> <t385>City folks like you will never be able to express the emotions of a hunter...</t385>
<t386>But as if suddenly remembering something, the old man stood up abruptly.</t386>
<t387>— Perhaps you are already tired.</t387> <t388>- He said.</t388> <t389>- Your bedroom has been prepared, and tomorrow you can get up whenever you like.</t389> <t390>As for me, I have some business that will keep me away until the afternoon.</t390> <t391>Sleep as much as you like, and may you have sweet dreams!</t391>
<t392>The old man opened the octagonal room door, then bowed politely as he always did - inviting me to step through.</t392> <t393>I went back to my room to catch up on sleep...</t393>
<t394>I was engulfed in a sea of doubts, fears..., then came up with all sorts of strange, bizarre things that even I didn't dare to find a clear answer for.</t394> <t395>Oh Lord, please let these be just temporary illusions!</t395>
<t396>• May 7</t396>
<t397>Another morning again.</t397> <t398>I began to feel healthy after twenty-four hours of peace.</t398> <t399>I could wake up late as I pleased.</t399> <t400>On the first day, after dressing neatly, I eagerly stepped into the room where I had eaten the night before; my breakfast was ready along with a cup of coffee placed by the smoky, fragrant fireplace.</t400> <t401>On the dining table, I saw a note with a few words: “I have to be absent.</t401> <t402>Please do not wait. D.”</t402>
<t403>So I could naturally have breakfast.</t403> <t404>After the meal, I looked around for a bell to call a servant to clear the table but couldn't find one anywhere.</t404> <t405>Seeing the valuable treasures scattered all over the house, I couldn't help but be surprised at the lack of other simple but useful items.</t405> <t406>The intricately carved gold tableware certainly had a very high value.</t406> <t407>The curtains were all made from the most splendid and luxurious fabrics, even the canopy over my bed was the same.</t407> <t408>All the armchairs and sofas in the house were also upholstered with premium fabrics.</t408> <t409>Despite having endured many centuries, the chairs here still retained their original state; I had seen similar chairs in Hampton Court, but most of them were rickety or had been gnawed by rodents.</t409> <t410>However, there was no room in this building that had a mirror.</t410> <t411>Not even on my table was there a fragment, so whenever I needed to shave or comb my hair, I had to use the tiny mirror attached to my travel bag.</t411> <t412>Even the servants were missing, at least until now I hadn't seen a single soul beyond the threshold.</t412> <t413>Another strange thing: since arriving here, I hadn't heard a single sound, not even the smallest, except for the distant mournful howls of the wolves.</t413> <t414>After the meal, I very much wanted to read something; I didn't want to explore the castle without the count's permission.</t414> <t415>But in the room where I stayed, there were no books, no newspapers, nothing with writing at all.</t415> <t416>Frustrated, I pushed randomly at a door, and to my surprise, it was the door to a library.</t416> <t417>I tried to open another door opposite the one I had just entered but couldn't, as it was firmly locked.</t417>
<t418>It is quite surprising to find here a multitude of English books filling the shelves, as well as many collections of magazines and illustrated journals.</t418> <t419>On the table placed in the middle of the room, there are also many newspapers and magazines written in English, but all of them are old. The library has all kinds of books on various subjects: history, geography, politics, political economy, botany, geology, law; and notably, all of them are related to England, to the life and customs of the English people!</t419>
<t420>I was busy checking the books when the door suddenly opened, the count unexpectedly appeared, he greeted me very sincerely and asked if I had slept well last night.</t420>
<t421>— I am very honored to see you in the library.</t421> <t422>- He said.</t422> <t423>- I am sure that everything in here will make you feel interested.</t423> <t424>To me, the books on the shelf - he said while stroking the spines of the books - are precious friends; for many years now, that is, since I had the idea of coming to London, these books have given me truly delightful moments! They have taught me about your beautiful country, and understanding England is to love England. How I long to stroll among the crowds on the streets of London, a majestic and grand city, to get lost in the noise of gentlemen and ladies, to share in the existence of that nation, and to share in everything that is happening with them!</t424> <t425>But alas! Until now, I have only known your language through these books.</t425> <t426>I hope that you will teach me how to speak English, my dear friend?</t426>
<t427>— But Count, - I replied - you are too modest, actually, you are speaking English very well!</t427>
<t428>The old man leaned over, his face very serious:</t428>
<t429>— Thank you, my friend; you overestimate me, in reality, I am still far from achieving my goal.</t429> <t430>It's true that I have a solid grasp of vocabulary and grammar, but when it comes to speaking, I'm still not there yet!</t430>
<t431>— I would like to reiterate that you speak perfectly!</t431>
<t432>— Not right, not right...</t432> <t433>I know full well that if I lived in London, when people hear me speak, no one would think I am English.</t433> <t434>That's why my understanding of English is still lacking.</t434> <t435>Here, I might be a noble, an aristocrat, and everyone knows me.</t435> <t436>To them, I am always a lord.</t436> <t437>But to become a citizen in a foreign country, I am as good as nonexistent: all I want is to be seen as just another person, so that no one stops to look at me or interrupts the conversation when they hear me speak, only to mockingly say: “Oh!</t437> <t438>So you are a foreigner!”.</t438> <t439>I have been a teacher for as many years as I wanted, at least that much, but I do not like anyone to be my teacher...</t439> <t440>You have come here not just as an employee working for my friend Peter Hawkins to handle matters related to my property in London, but I hope you will stay here for a long time, and through our conversations, I will become familiar with the English intonation.</t440> <t441>I will ask you to point out even the smallest mistakes I make while speaking.</t441> <t442>I am very sorry for being away so long today, I hope you will forgive me, won't you, if I tell you that today I had many important matters to attend to.</t442>
<t443>Of course, I had to answer that I didn't care about that at all, but what I wanted at that moment was to be allowed to enter the library whenever I liked.</t443> <t444>"Certainly, that's fine," he replied when I asked for permission, then he added, "You can go anywhere you want in this castle, except for the rooms you find locked and, of course, the places you don't want to set foot in.</t444> <t445>Here, everything has a reason for its existence in its original state, and if you knew what I know, you would understand everything here thoroughly."</t445>
<t446>I said that I had no doubt about it.</t446> <t447>Hearing that, he continued to lecture:</t447>
<t448>— We are in Transylvania, and Transylvania is not England.</t448> <t449>Our customs and traditions are not yours, so there will be many things that are strange to you.</t449> <t450>However, based on what you have told me about the difficulties during your journey here, I am sure what I just said will not surprise you.</t450>
<t451>The count's insinuation added more interest to the conversation; noticing that he was enjoying the talk, meaning he wanted to converse just for the sake of it, I posed many questions to him about what I should take note of in his country, or about what I had experienced.</t451> <t452>Occasionally, he would avoid the issue or steer the conversation in another direction, claiming he did not understand what I meant.</t452> <t453>But generally, he answered my questions directly.</t453> <t454>After quite a while, feeling more at ease, I began to talk about the eerie night I arrived at the castle and asked him to explain: among a series of events, why did the coachman jump off the carriage whenever he saw a greenish light, and why did he keep heading towards that light.</t454> <t455>He informed me that according to Transylvanian folklore, on a certain night of the year - the night when demons are believed to rule the world, one would see a blue flame appear exactly where a treasure is buried underground.</t455>
<t456>The old man continued the story:</t456>
<t457>— There is a treasure buried in the place you passed by that night, for this is a land that the Wallachians, Saxons, and Turks have contested for centuries.</t457> <t458>Indeed, there is not an inch of this land that has not been stained with the blood of patriots and invaders alike.</t458> <t459>It was an extraordinary period.</t459> <t460>The Austrian and Hungarian tribes constantly threatened us.</t460> <t461>Our ancestors, both old and young, women and men alike, all bravely fought against the enemy.</t461> <t462>They clung to the mountains, waiting on the cliffs, ambushing, and from these high peaks, they caused landslides and avalanches to bury the invaders.</t462> <t463>But in the end, the enemy stubbornly pushed through.</t463> <t464>Nevertheless, they found almost nothing but empty gardens and deserted homes in this country, for the people had buried everything they had underground.</t464>
<t465>— But why - I asked - have those treasures been hidden for so long, while the blue lights clearly indicate the hiding places to people who, surely, only want one thing: to sit and watch them?</t465>
<t466>The old count burst out laughing, baring his long and sharp teeth:</t466>
<t467>— Ah! The person you mentioned must surely be a fool and a coward!</t467> <t468>As I said, those flames only appear on a single night of the year - just one night, mind you, and on that night, no one in this land would want to stick their nose out the door, unless absolutely necessary.</t468> <t469>And my dear friend, please believe me, if someone steps out the door, they would probably only...</t469> <t470>The person you just mentioned, that is, the one who couldn't find the markers he had set.</t470> <t471>Even you, I swear, you won't be able to find the spots where you saw those flames!</t471>
<t472>— That's right, I replied, if I dive into this search, I might bring trouble upon myself!</t472>
<t473>Then we turned to talk about other things.</t473>
<t474>— Well, - the Count said - now please tell me the news about London and all the details you can provide about the house you intend to buy for me.</t474>
<t475>I apologize for my carelessness and ask to go to my room to find the contract papers.</t475> <t476>While arranging the papers, I suddenly heard the clinking sound of porcelain and metal from the next room, and when I passed by, I saw that the dining table had been cleared, and the lights had been turned on, as it was getting dark.</t476> <t477>The lights in the library were also lit, and the count was lying on the couch reading a book.</t477> <t478>Among a pile of books, he chose Bradshaw's "Handbook to England."</t478> <t479>Seeing me enter, he put down the book and stood up to clear the scattered books and newspapers on the table.</t479> <t480>We began to review the entire plan and the numbers recorded in the papers I had just brought over.</t480> <t481>Every detail genuinely interested him, and he kept asking me about the house, its location, and the surrounding landscape.</t481> <t482>In this regard, he had certainly studied very meticulously, as I noticed he knew some things even better than I did.</t482> <t483>Occasionally, I had to cleverly compliment his knowledge.</t483>
<t484>— But my friend, - He said - isn't it necessary for me to do so?</t484> <t485>When I got there, I was alone and my dear friend Jonathan Harker...</t485> <t486>Oh! Sorry, in this country, we usually have the habit of calling by first name before the last name...</t486> <t487>my dear friend Jonathan Harker is not always around to help me with useful advice and knowledge...</t487> <t488>No...</t488> <t489>During that time, in Exeter, many miles away from London, he was busy with notary work along with another friend of mine, Peter Hawkins.</t489> <t490>That's it!</t490>
<t491>When all the details related to the purchase of the land in Purfleet were clear, the necessary papers were signed, and the letter to Mr. Hawkins was finished, he suddenly asked how I had found such a pleasant property.</t491> <t492>What better could I do than read to him the notes I had recorded?</t492>
<t493>“When I took a turn off the main road in Purfleet, I came across a building that seemed suitable for our client.</t493> <t494>There was an old, dull notice posted there announcing that the house was for sale.</t494> <t495>It was a walled house built of stone, which had not been maintained for many years.</t495> <t496>The doors were all made of old oak, and all the metalwork was rusted.</t496>
<t497>This house is named Carfax, an old language name meaning "four sides," as the house has four faces corresponding to the four cardinal directions.</t497> <t498>The entire house covers an area of about twenty acres and, as I mentioned, all the land is surrounded by solid stone walls.</t498> <t499>The trees here are so numerous that they cast shadows everywhere, the pond in the garden is very deep and must be fed from many sources, as the water there is very clear, and the pond water flows further to form a fairly wide stream.</t499> <t500>The house looks very massive and is certainly built from the medieval period.</t500>
<t501>A part of the house is indeed built with rather thick stone slabs, the rare windows seen on the building are all placed high and protected by heavy iron bars, perhaps this was once a watchtower.</t501> <t502>Adjacent to it is a small church.</t502> <t503>Without a key, I couldn't enter this private church.</t503> <t504>But I took photos from many angles.</t504> <t505>The sanctuary must have been built later, and I couldn't estimate the measurements.</t505> <t506>That's all I can say.</t506> <t507>In the surrounding areas, there are only a few other houses, one of which is a very large house currently being used as an asylum for mental patients.</t507> <t508>However, from the Carfax estate, this sanatorium cannot be clearly seen.</t508>
<t509>After I finished reading, the count told me what he liked about the new mansion.</t509>
<t510>— The spaciousness and the ancient look of the house pleased me very much - The old man explained - I myself belong to an ancient lineage and sooner or later I will have to return to the afterlife when I have moved into a new house.</t510> <t511>It is not in a day or two that the house can be habitable.</t511> <t512>I was also very pleased to know that there is a small chapel there, because as a member of the Transylvanian nobility, it is quite unpleasant for us to think that our remains would be buried alongside those of lesser people.</t512> <t513>As for me, I no longer have the interest to seek joy and happiness.</t513> <t514>I do not expect the happiness that life still grants to the young.</t514> <t515>Simply because I am no longer young! My heart, a heart that has spent long years mourning the fate of those in the grave, is no longer moved by desires.</t515> <t516>Moreover, the walls of my castle have also begun to crumble, with wind and rain seeping into every corner.</t516> <t517>And I must confess that I love the shadows and all that is dark, nothing pleases me more than being alone with my own thoughts.</t517>
<t518>The old man's words seemed to contradict his facial expression, or in other words, the features on his face created an impression that I couldn't decide whether to call cruel or dark!</t518>
<t519>After a while, he asked to be excused and suggested that I gather all the documents together.</t519> <t520>Guessing that he wouldn't return soon, I took the opportunity to glance through the book titles.</t520> <t521>My eyes stopped at an atlas, naturally opened to the map of England, and it was clear that this map had been consulted many times.</t521> <t522>I even saw that the map had many small circles marked; upon closer inspection, I noticed one circle was drawn to the west of London, exactly where the count's new mansion was located; two other circles indicated the positions of two houses in Exeter and Whitby on the Yorkshire coast.</t522>
<t523>The old count returned to the library after nearly an hour.</t523>
<t524>— Oh, look! - The old man exclaimed. - Still engrossed in reading?</t524> <t525>It's still very early now.</t525> <t526>But you know, it's not always necessary to work.</t526> <t527>Come on, I was just informed that your meal is ready.</t527>
<t528>The old man took my hand and we walked to the next room, where my soup had already been served.</t528> <t529>Once again, he apologized: he had already dined out.</t529> <t530>But just like the night before, he sat close to me to talk while I was eating.</t530> <t531>He asked me one question after another, even though I had finished eating a long time ago.</t531> <t532>Hours passed by, and I was sure it was already very late at night, but I didn't say anything; I felt my duty at that moment was to please the host in every way.</t532> <t533>Moreover, I didn't feel like sleeping; the long sleep from the previous night had completely refreshed me after a tiring journey.</t533> <t534>However, for some reason, I felt a shiver, the kind of shiver one often experiences just before dawn, and this made me think of a tidal wave.</t534>
<t535>It is said that those who are dying often take their last breath at the beginning of a new day or when the tide changes.</t535> <t536>All those who have ever spent time contemplating the moment when night turns to day will easily understand me at this moment.</t536> <t537>I suddenly heard a clear, distant rooster crow, almost echoing from a supernatural realm.</t537> <t538>Count Dracula stood up abruptly and exclaimed:</t538>
<t539>— What! Is it morning already?</t539> <t540>I'm sorry for keeping you up so late! From now on, when talking about England, my new but very dear homeland, please try not to tell such interesting stories so that I won't lose track of time again...</t540>
<t541>The old man bowed his head to greet me and then quickly walked out of the room.</t541>
<t542>Returning to my room but not going to sleep immediately, I drew the curtains to look outside, but there was nothing interesting to mention here.</t542> <t543>The window of my room overlooks a small yard, and I could only see the gray sky gradually brightening.</t543> <t544>After fully closing the curtains, I began to sit at the desk to write these pages.</t544>
<t545>• May 8</t545>
<t546>When I started this diary entry, I was afraid I would ramble on; but now I feel that I worried too much: I can stop at each clear detail, because right from the beginning when I arrived at the castle, everything I saw and everything that happened was so strange that I couldn't help but feel uneasy whenever I thought about them.</t546> <t547>I want to leave here - leave here peacefully and never come back again! Perhaps staying up late every night has put my nervous system through a tremendous ordeal.</t547> <t548>I could endure this existence if at least I could talk to someone else, but there is absolutely no one, except for the host count.</t548>
<t549>If I have to speak my mind from the bottom of my heart, to be honest, I am afraid that I am the only living soul here...</t549> <t550>Yes, if I were allowed to reveal things as they truly are, then perhaps I could be a little more patient to endure, to restrain my ever-vivid imagination.</t550> <t551>Otherwise, I feel like I am falling into a fog of despair.</t551> <t552>Everything must happen exactly as I perceive it.</t552>
<t553>Reclining on the bed, I only managed to doze off for a few hours before waking up.</t553> <t554>Feeling that I couldn't sleep any longer, I jumped up and grabbed the mirror hanging on the window latch to prepare for shaving.</t554> <t555>Suddenly, I felt a hand gently placed on my shoulder, followed by the voice of the old count: "Good morning!" I was startled, truly amazed that I hadn't seen him enter the room, for looking through the mirror, I had clearly seen the entire length of the room behind me.</t555> <t556>In my surprise, I had slightly nicked my face with the razor, something I didn't immediately realize at that moment.</t556> <t557>While responding to the count, I looked back into the mirror, trying to understand how I could have been mistaken.</t557> <t558>This time, there could be no mistake; I knew he was standing very close to me, I only needed to turn my face slightly to see him standing right by my shoulder, yet strangely, his reflection did not appear in the mirror! Everything behind me was reflected in the mirror, but there was only one man there, and that was me, the one writing these diary entries.</t558> <t559>Another astonishing event added to a series of mysteries that I could not comprehend, further aggravating the discomfort I was enduring with the count's presence.</t559> <t560>Then I suddenly noticed a bloodstain under my chin.</t560> <t561>I put down the razor and turned away to find a piece of cotton.</t561> <t562>Looking at my face, the count's eyes suddenly gleamed with a malicious frenzy.</t562> <t563>Suddenly, he grabbed my neck.</t563> <t564>I quickly stepped back, causing his hand to miss and hit the chain with the small cross I was wearing around my neck.</t564> <t565>A moment passed, and his appearance changed noticeably, the madness in his eyes vanished as quickly as it had appeared.</t565>
<t566>— Be careful, - he told me - be extremely cautious when you get injured.</t566> <t567>In this land, it is more dangerous than you think.</t567>
<t568>Take the mirror I just hung on the window frame, he continued:</t568>
<t569>— If you are injured, it is merely because of this damned thing!</t569> <t570>It only enhances the arrogant and delusional nature of humans.</t570> <t571>It is best to get rid of it.</t571>
<t572>After finishing his words, he flung open the heavy window and immediately threw my mirror down into the yard, shattering it into hundreds of pieces.</t572> <t573>Then, without saying a word, he quickly walked out of the room.</t573>
<t574>How do I know how to shave now? There's only one way left: use the watch case or the bottom of the shaving brush case, both fortunately made of metal, instead of a mirror.</t574>
<t575>Stepping into the dining room, I saw that my breakfast had been prepared, but there was no sign of the count.</t575> <t576>So I had to have breakfast alone again.</t576>
<t577>Since arriving at the castle, I have not once seen the count eat or drink anything.</t577> <t578>Is he truly a lonely old man?</t578> <t579>After the meal, I naturally wanted to explore the castle.</t579> <t580>I walked towards the staircase, nearby there was a door ajar leading into a room, in the room there was only a window facing south.</t580> <t581>From this place, I could take in a vast landscape.</t581> <t582>The castle I was standing in was built right on the edge of a magnificent abyss.</t582> <t583>A stone thrown from a window of the castle would not hit anything in its path as it fell.</t583> <t584>In my view was an endless sea of green trees, occasionally revealing spots that I knew were mountain hollows.</t584> <t585>I also saw many shimmering silver threads, which were streams flowing into the ravines through the vast forest.</t585>
<t586>But I didn't feel any interest in describing the magical natural scenery at this moment.</t586> <t587>Therefore, after a while of sightseeing, I continued my exploration.</t587> <t588>I only saw doors, doors everywhere, wherever I looked, all of them were locked or bolted.</t588> <t589>There was no way out of here, except for one way, which was to jump through the windows precariously perched on the towering walls.</t589>
<t590>This castle is truly a prison, and I am indeed a prisoner!</t590>
<t591>CHAPTER 3</t591>
<t592>Jonathan Harker's Diary (continued)</t592>
<t593>Prisoner! When I realized that reality, I thought I was going to go mad.</t593><t594>I kept running up and down the stairs, trying to open any door I came across, peeking through every window I passed.</t594><t595>After a short while, the feeling of helplessness extinguished all my willpower.</t595><t596>After a few hours, honestly, just thinking about being like a rat struggling in a cage made me want to go insane.</t596><t597>However, once I understood that struggling was futile, I began to calm down to think and find a way to overcome the situation.</t597><t598>But at this moment, my mind could only think aimlessly and couldn't find any solution.</t598><t599>I only knew one thing for sure, that it was completely useless to tell the count about my feelings.</t599><t600>More than anyone, he knew I was a prisoner here, he wanted it that way, and surely had a reason for it.</t600><t601>Therefore, if I confided in him, it was clear he would never admit the truth.</t601><t602>So I thought that before clarifying anything, the first thing to do was not to speak about what I had just discovered, not to let him suspect my fears... and always keep a calm demeanor.</t602><t603>I understood my situation very clearly at that moment: either I would be a child haunted by fear, or fall into a more difficult situation, and if I accepted that, in the coming days, I would need, very much need, a clear mind.</t603>
<t604>Lost in thought, I suddenly heard the sound of a door closing downstairs: the old count had returned.</t604><t605>He did not go straight to the library.</t605><t606>I had to stealthily return to my room.</t606><t607>I was very surprised to see him in there making my bed! Despite my immense astonishment, it confirmed something I had suspected since setting foot in this castle: there were no servants in the house.</t607><t608>And a moment later, when I looked through the crack in the door and saw him setting the dining table in the dining room, I had no more doubts, for if he was taking on these tasks, it was simply because he had no servants to do them for him.</t608><t609>I shuddered in fear at the thought that if there was no one else in the castle, the coachman who brought me here was none other than the old count himself.</t609><t610>If that were true, what would it say about the power he wielded by raising his hand to command the wolves? Why were the people at the Bistritz hotel and all my fellow travelers on the first coach so fearful for me?</t610><t611>Why did they give me a small cross, a sprig of garlic, and a wild rose?</t611><t612>May God bless the kind-hearted woman who gave me the rosary with the cross?</t612><t613>For every time I touch that cross, I feel as if I am imbued with strength and courage.</t613><t614>I was very surprised to see that the cross, an inanimate object, something I had long considered useless, merely a symbol of faith, could somewhat save me from feelings of loneliness and despair.</t614><t615>Does that small cross have an intrinsic power, or is it merely an object that revives old memories?</t615><t616>I hope that one day, I will be able to test the matter to provide an answer.</t616><t617>In the meantime, I must grasp as much as possible about Count Dracula; perhaps it will help me understand everything that is happening.</t617><t618>And perhaps tonight he will reveal many things if I steer the conversation in this direction.</t618><t619>However, I must also be very cautious so that he cannot suspect my inner thoughts.</t619>
<t620>• Midnight</t620>
<t621>I had a very long conversation with the old count.</t621> <t622>I asked him a few questions about the history of Transylvania, and he answered them very enthusiastically.</t622> <t623>The topic I asked about seemed to really excite him!</t623> <t624>When he talked about life, people, and especially when he spoke about battles, I saw him eager as if he were participating in those events himself.</t624> <t625>He said that his position showed one thing: for a nobleman like him, the glory of his lineage and his name was his personal pride, the honor of his family was his honor, and the fate of his lineage was his fate.</t625> <t626>Every time he spoke about his lineage, he would refer to "us" as monarchs often do.</t626> <t627>I want to recreate here everything he told me, because recording is also a personal pleasure of mine.</t627> <t628>Perhaps I have heard the entire history of the land of Transylvania.</t628> <t629>The more he talked, the more excited he became; while speaking, he paced back and forth in the room, his hands either caressing his white mustache or gripping any object he touched as if he wanted to crush it.</t629> <t630>I tried to record a part of what he told me related to the history of his land.</t630>
<t631>“We, the Szekelys, have the right to be proud, for we carry the blood of brave and courageous peoples - who fought like real lions to protect their supremacy.</t631><t632>In this country, always bustling with countless European ethnicities, the warriors from Iceland brought with them the belligerent spirit that Thor and Wodin instilled in them, and they brought madness to every European shore - of course, European, but also to the shores of Asia and the dark continent to the extent that the people of those lands thought they were being attacked by packs of wolves.</t632><t633>Even when invading here, those suspicious warriors turned the famously warlike Huns into dying victims and forced them to admit that in those executioners ran the blood of old witches, those who had been driven out of Scythia and gathered in the desert with demons.</t633><t634>Indeed, what fools?</t634><t635>Has there ever been a witch or demon as powerful as Attila, whose blood flows in our veins?” - He said while rolling up his sleeves to show me.</t635><t636>- “We must admit we are a warlike and proud race, so is it any wonder that the Magyars, Lombards, Avars, or Turks tried to invade us and were all driven back?</t636><t637>Is it any wonder that Arpad and his army, wanting to invade the motherland, were stopped right at the border?</t637><t638>Then when the Hungarians attempted to invade from the east, the victorious Magyars allied with the Szekelys.</t638><t639>From then on, for many centuries, we were entrusted with guarding the Turkish border. Moreover, our duty seemed never-ending, because, according to the Turkish proverb, “the tree stands still, but the wind never stops.”</t639><t640>So among the four nations, which nation was more honored to receive the “bloodstained sword” than us, which nation quickly rallied under the emperor's banner when he called for battle more than us?</t640><t641>And when the flags of the Wallachians and Magyars were lowered before the scythe flag, when will the great shame of my country be washed away?</t641><t642>Wasn't it one of my relatives who crossed the Danube to fight against the Turks on his own land?</t642><t643>Yes, it was a Dracula! Truly cursing a brother of his, he sold the nation to the Turks, causing many to suffer the shame of slavery! And it was also a Dracula who crossed the river years ago and passed on the passionate patriotism to a descendant who then crossed the river with his army to invade Turkey again? This man, after fighting and retreating, returned many times to lead the army, leaving behind a battlefield strewn with soldiers' bodies, because he knew that in the end, only he would win!</t643><t644>People say he did it for himself! But what would armies mean without a commander?</t644><t645>Where would the battle go without a heart and mind to guide it?</t645><t646>Moreover, after the battle of Mohacs, we shattered the Hungarian domination.</t646><t647>We, the Draculas, once again joined the ranks of commanders who achieved this victory! Well? Young friend, the Szekelys and Draculas were the blood, brain, and sword of the armies - the Szekelys can be proud of having done what the arrogant Hapsburgs and Romanoffs could not...</t647><t648>But the war is over.</t648><t649>Blood is now considered a precious thing in our disgraceful peacetime, and now, the glory of our great ancestors is just a fairy tale.”</t649>
<t650>When the old man stopped his story, it was also when a new day was about to begin, and we had to part ways to go to our rooms to sleep. (My diary is terribly similar to the story "One Thousand and One Nights," because everything stops at the first crow of the rooster, and it surely will remind one of the appearance of the ghost of Hamlet's father before him).</t650>
<t651>• May 12</t651>
<t652>Last night, Count Dracula came to see me again. As soon as we met, he immediately asked about some issues related to the law and how to handle certain cases.</t652> <t653>I noticed that his questions seemed to have a certain order. I will try to respect this order when recalling the questions here, as it might be useful for me later on.</t653>
<t654>First, he asked me if it was possible in England to hire two or more notaries at the same time.</t654> <t655>I replied that if one wished, they could hire a dozen, but a wiser person would only seek the help of one notary for a single matter, because if they hired multiple people at once, they would surely unintentionally act against their own interests.</t655> <t656>My landlord seemed to understand the issue thoroughly, but he still wondered if hiring one notary to oversee financial activities and another to handle the receipt of goods shipped by sea, in case the first one was far from the port, would cause any problems.</t656>
<t657>I suggested that he clarify more because I was afraid I would misunderstand his intentions.</t657> <t658>He said:</t658>
<t659>— Here's the thing! Let's assume this: our friend, Mr. Peter Hawkins, residing in Exeter, a place far from London, through your intermediary role, buys a mansion for me in this city.</t659> <t660>Alright! Now let me get straight to the point - as you might find it amusing that I ask someone far from London to do this instead of someone right in London - that I do not want any personal gain of someone to hinder my interests.</t660> <t661>In such a transaction, a London notary could very well be tempted by personal gain or assist someone else in making money; I reiterate, that person will help me achieve my interests in the best way possible.</t661> <t662>Now let's assume that I, a very busy person, want to send goods, for example, to Newcastle, or to Durham, Harwich, or Dover, would it be easy for me to ask a businessman residing in one of these ports?</t662>
<t663>I replied that certainly the work at that time would no longer be simple, but the notaries had created a network of offices among themselves that allowed them to arrange local tasks at the request of any individual notary. Therefore, clients could entrust all their interests to a single person and not have to worry about anything.</t663>
<t664>— But in my case, can I personally manage the work?</t664>
<t665>— Of course! - I replied - that usually happens when the person involved doesn't want others to know about the transactions taking place.</t665>
<t666>— Good - The old man grunted abruptly.</t666>
<t667>Then he continued to ask me about the procedures for shipping goods, the necessary registration processes, and the common difficulties encountered if the person concerned hasn't thought of preventive measures.</t667>
<t668>I provided every possible explanation within my capability, and I think he also has the ability to perfectly execute his notary inclination, because there is nothing he hasn't thought of and nothing he hasn't anticipated.</t668> <t669>For someone who has never set foot in England, and has never experienced legal matters like he has, to have such understanding and clear-headed speculation is truly astonishing.</t669>
<t670>When I had gathered all the desired consultation information, and when he saw me double-checking some points in the books beside me, he suddenly stood up and asked me:</t670>
<t671>— After the first letter, have you written any more letters to your friend Peter Hawkins or anyone else?</t671>
<t672>I suddenly felt somewhat bitter when I replied to the old man that no, I hadn't had the opportunity to send any letters to my friends.</t672>
<t673>— Then write now, - He said while placing a heavy hand on my shoulder - write to Mr. Peter Hawkins or anyone you wish; and please inform them that you will be staying here for another month, starting from today.</t673>
<t674>— You want me to stay here that long? - I asked, shivering at his statement.</t674>
<t675>— Yes, I want that and I will not accept any refusal.</t675> <t676>When your master, your boss, sent me someone in his name, he agreed that I could use that person as I see fit for my work...</t676> <t677>Don't refuse?</t677> <t678>Do you agree?</t678>
<t679>If I don't agree, then what else can I do?</t679> <t680>In this matter, the person with the vested interest is Mr. Hawkins, not me, and I have to think of him, not myself.</t680> <t681>Moreover, in the words, the gaze, and especially in the behavior of Count Dracula, there is something that reminds me that I am a prisoner in his house, and even if I wanted to leave, I couldn't shorten my stay here.</t681> <t682>He has won in such a way that I must submit; he sees through the confusion clearly shown on my face, he has become the master.</t682> <t683>Immediately, he exploits this doubled strength with his familiar gentle voice, the voice I cannot resist:</t683>
<t684>— First of all, I can see the suggestion, my dear young friend, please only talk about work in the letter.</t684> <t685>Surely your friends are very eager to know that you are well and always thinking about the day you return to them.</t685> <t686>This, you can tell them in a word.</t686>
<t687>As he spoke, he handed me three sheets of paper and three envelopes.</t687> <t688>It was a very thin type of paper.</t688> <t689>Looking at the sheets of paper, and looking at his casually smiling face with long, sharp teeth protruding beyond his bright red lips, I understood what he had just told me, I understood that I would have to be careful with the letters, because he could read everything.</t689> <t690>Therefore, I decided to write only brief and rather meaningless letters at first, and then secretly write longer ones to Mr. Hawkins and Mina later.</t690> <t691>Indeed, for Mina, I could write in shorthand, because at least if he saw it, the count would not be able to understand those scribbled characters.</t691>
<t692>Having finished writing two letters, I quietly sat down to read them again, while the old man was also sitting and writing, occasionally pausing to look something up in the books placed on the table.</t692>
<t693>After finishing writing, the old man placed my two letters on top of his letter, then set the stack down near the ink bottle and pen holder, and afterward, he went outside.</t693> <t694>As soon as the door closed behind him, I quickly bent down to look at the letters he had just written.</t694> <t695>I truly did not regret it one bit, because in situations like this, I had to find a way to escape by any means necessary.</t695>
<t696>A letter I saw was addressed to Samuel F. Billington, No. 7, Crescent Street, Whitby; one was sent to Mr. Leutnes, in Varna; the third was sent to Coutt in Co. London, and the last one was sent to Klopstock Bill reuth, a banker in Budapest.</t696> <t697>The second and fourth letters were not sealed.</t697> <t698>I was about to open and read them when I suddenly heard a noise outside the door.</t698> <t699>Startled, I quickly put the letters back in their original place, then grabbed a book and pretended to read just before the old count returned with another letter in his hand.</t699> <t700>He affixed stamps to the letters on the table, then turned to me and said:</t700>
<t701>— I hope you will forgive me, I have another engagement tonight.</t701> <t702>You will find everything you need here, won't you?</t702>
<t703>Reaching the door, he paused for a moment and then turned back:</t703>
<t704>— My dear young friend, I have a piece of advice, or rather a warning for you: if you leave these rooms, you will not be able to find a good night's sleep anywhere in the castle! Because this is an ancient manor, it holds many old memories, and nightmares will descend upon those who like to sleep in rooms where they are not permitted to sleep.</t704> <t705>I remind you to be cautious.</t705> <t706>If at any point you feel sleepy, or you want to go to sleep, please return to your room as quickly as possible; otherwise, you can enter one of the rooms in this area, where you can sleep peacefully.</t706> <t707>But if you are not careful, then...</t707>
<t708>The unfinished sentence of the old man contained something that made me shudder with fear.</t708> <t709>I understood what he said.</t709> <t710>The only thing I couldn't explain at this moment was whether that dream, no matter what kind of dream it was, could be more terrifying than the dark and mysterious nets closing in around me.</t710>
<t711>• A moment later</t711>
<t712>I reread the lines I just wrote and felt they were acceptable, of course, I didn't hesitate or make any corrections.</t712> <t713>In this castle, there's no place that scares me enough to lose sleep, as long as the landlord isn't there.</t713> <t714>I believe that just placing a small cross at the head of the bed will allow me to sleep peacefully without fearing any nightmares.</t714> <t715>And the cross remains there.</t715>
<t716>The Count had just left, and I returned to my room immediately.</t716> <t717>A long while later, when I could no longer hear any sound, I quietly went out to the hallway to find the window facing south.</t717> <t718>In contrast to the narrow, dark, and confined space of the castle courtyard, the vast, far-reaching space outside gave me a slight sense of the free sky.</t718> <t719>Nothing compares to breathing in the fresh air at this moment, even though it was still nighttime.</t719> <t720>While engrossed in the scenery, I suddenly jolted when I inadvertently noticed my own shadow, and thus the most bizarre and terrifying thoughts flooded my mind.</t720> <t721>Indeed, only God knows that my fears are not unfounded?</t721> <t722>I tried to calm myself, gazing at the scenery spreading out before me, under the bright moonlight as if it were daytime.</t722> <t723>Under the pale moonlight, the distant rolling hills seemed to blend with the valleys and ravines, forming a smooth, velvet-like black color.</t723> <t724>That simple beauty helped me calm down, and each cool breeze seemed to bring me peace and a bit of comfort and solace.</t724> <t725>Leaning out the window to look down at the foot of the castle, I accidentally discovered something moving on the lower floor, slightly to the left.</t725> <t726>From what I knew about the arrangement of the rooms, it seemed that the Count's quarters were right there.</t726> <t727>The window where I was leaning out was in a very high position, the frame deep, and the sills were all made of stone, so even if they were damaged over the years, there was nothing particularly noteworthy.</t727> <t728>I stood up straight to avoid being detected, but I did not forget to keep an eye on what was happening below.</t728>
<t729>The old count's head just poked out from the window on the lower floor; although I couldn't see his face, I still recognized him by his neck, back, and the unmistakable movements of his two arms, especially his hands - I couldn't be mistaken because I had many occasions to notice his peculiar hands.</t729> <t730>At first, I felt both intrigued and amused to be spying like that, because indeed there was nothing amusing or intriguing for a prisoner in normal times.</t730> <t731>However, all my initial feelings were quickly replaced by a sense of disgust and horror when I saw the old count slowly slither out of the window and begin to crawl along the castle wall.</t731> <t732>He kept crawling like that over the dizzying abyss, his black cloak spread wide like bat wings.</t732> <t733>I truly couldn't believe my eyes.</t733> <t734>At first, I thought I was dazzled by the moonlight or confused by some shadow, but when I strained my eyes to look more closely, I realized I was not mistaken.</t734> <t735>I could clearly see the fingers and toes gripping tightly onto the edges of the stones whose mortar had been eroded by time.</t735> <t736>He crawled swiftly down the deep wall.</t736>
<t737>Is he a superhuman being, or a monster in human disguise?</t737> <t738>The scene unfolding right before my eyes made me feel more horrified than ever, I was scared... I was terrified to the point of panic... and I couldn't help but flee...</t738>
<t739>• May 15</t739>
<t740>I was stunned to see the old count continue to crawl like a lizard.</t740> <t741>He crawled along the wall in a slightly diagonal line to the left.</t741> <t742>Then he suddenly slipped into a hole or some kind of window.</t742> <t743>When I could no longer see his head, I dared to lean out further to get a clearer view of his path, but I didn't discover anything new, as the hole or window was too far from where I stood.</t743> <t744>However, I was certain of one thing: the count had left the castle, and now I could do something I hadn't dared to do before: take the opportunity to explore the castle.</t744> <t745>I went to the middle of the room, grabbed the lamp, and tried to open all the doors.</t745> <t746>As I suspected, every door was tightly locked, and from what I could see, the locks were relatively new.</t746> <t747>I went down the stairs, walked along the hallway through the door I had entered on my first night at the castle.</t747> <t748>I found that I could easily open the door latches and remove the chain, but the door was tightly locked, and of course, the key was no longer in the lock.</t748> <t749>Surely the key was kept in the count's room, and so I needed to seize the opportunity, when his room door was unlocked, to sneak in, steal the key, and escape.</t749>
<t750>I continued to meticulously inspect each corridor, each staircase, and tried opening all the doors I encountered along the way.</t750> <t751>The doors of one or two small rooms facing the central corridor were unlocked, but inside there was nothing noteworthy except for some old dusty wooden furniture and a few fabric-covered armchairs that had been badly gnawed by termites.</t751> <t752>Finally, upon reaching the top of a staircase, I came across a door that at first glance seemed tightly locked, but when I gave it a gentle push, it budged slightly.</t752> <t753>Continuing to push harder, I realized that the door was indeed not locked; it just resisted my push a bit because the hinges were somewhat loose, causing the door to sag close to the floor.</t753> <t754>This might be a unique opportunity that I must seize.</t754> <t755>After a few attempts of mustering my strength, I managed to open the door.</t755> <t756>I was standing in an annex of the castle, which was slightly to the right and below the rooms I had previously explored.</t756> <t757>Looking through the window, I saw the rooms stretching along the southern side of the castle, with the windows of the last room facing both south and west.</t757> <t758>Both sides overlooked a deep abyss.</t758> <t759>The castle was built right at the corner of a large mountain peak, so much so that all three sides were inaccessible; similarly, the windows were positioned very high on the walls, making them invulnerable to weapons like bows, catapults, and conventional firearms, which couldn't reach them.</t759> <t760>The high position of the windows gave part of the castle a more airy and pleasant atmosphere.</t760> <t761>To the east lay a valley deep at the foot of towering and steep mountains.</t761>
<t762>Surely, in the old days, these rooms were the quarters of the ladies, because all the furniture here seems to be more comfortable compared to what I have seen in other rooms.</t762> <t763>The windows had no curtains, so the clear moonlight filtered through the glass, allowing me to easily distinguish the colors of the objects in the room, even though everything was blurred by the dust of time.</t763> <t764>The lamp in my hand suddenly became useless under the moonlight, but it still somewhat made me feel at ease, as it was clear that I was alone, a loneliness that made my heart tighten with a vague fear.</t764> <t765>However, it was better to be alone like this than to have the old count in the room.</t765> <t766>A bit of rational effort along with the comfort of the lamp in my hand helped me calm down.</t766> <t767>I sat down by a small oak table, where once a beautiful woman must have sat, dreamily and bashfully writing flowing but clumsy love letters.</t767> <t768>I sat thinking back on the diary pages that recorded everything that had happened to me.</t768> <t769>Shorthand is indeed a nineteenth-century advancement!</t769> <t770>Indeed, each century has its own distinct powers that modernism cannot extinguish...</t770>
<t771>• May 16, morning</t771>
<t772>God wants me to maintain my mental balance at this moment, because that is all I have left.</t772> <t773>For me, safety, or ensuring safety, is a thing of the past.</t773> <t774>In the remaining weeks of living here, I can only hope that I do not become a madman.</t774> <t775>And if I can keep a sound mind, I will surely panic at the thought that among all the threats surrounding me here, the presence of the count is the least of them! Oh God! Oh merciful God!</t775> <t776>Help me to stay calm, for if calmness leaves me, it will surely give way to madness! At this moment, when I feel like my mind is about to go insane or at least has just gone through a harmful shock, I can only entrust myself to the diary: the diary will be my guide.</t776> <t777>Detailing everything I discover will be a way for me to console myself.</t777>
<t778>The mysterious warning of the old count made me fearful from the moment he spoke, and now, thinking back, I feel even more terrified because I know this strange man will have a terrible influence on me.</t778> <t779>What I need to do now is not to take his words too seriously!</t779>
<t780>Having finished writing the recent diary entries and putting the paper and pen into my pocket, I suddenly felt my eyes grow heavy with sleep.</t780> <t781>Of course, I did not forget the count's warning, but for some reason, I still liked not following his words.</t781> <t782>The bright moonlight seemed so gentle and kind to me, and the vast, expansive scenery outside also seemed to want to comfort and soothe me, giving me a sense of the free sky.</t782> <t783>I decided not to return to my room but to sleep right here, where people still speculate about the presence of noble ladies of the past and where they used to gather to sing and alleviate the sadness of a luxurious but dull life, as their husbands were always away in distant lands due to endless and deadly wars.</t783> <t784>I chose a long reclining chair placed near the window so that I could still enjoy the view while lying down.</t784>
<t785>Ignoring the thin layer of dust, I wearily leaned back, hoping to soon fall asleep.</t785> <t786>Indeed, I did fall asleep, or at least I hoped I did, because honestly, I was just afraid I hadn't fallen asleep yet, as everything that happened next seemed so real to me that even now, in broad daylight, in a room filled with the bright morning light, I still can't believe I could have been dreaming.</t786>
<t787>I'm not alone in the room.</t787> <t788>Clearly, nothing has changed since I stepped in here.</t788> <t789>I noticed on the floor, the moonlight illuminated my footprints clearly imprinted on the layer of dust.</t789> <t790>But standing before me now are three women, three noblewomen as shown by their makeup and demeanor.</t790> <t791>At first glance, I thought I was dreaming, because even though the moonlight shone through the window, I still couldn't see any shadow of theirs cast on the floor.</t791> <t792>They approached me, stared at my face for a moment, then turned to each other and whispered something.</t792> <t793>Two of them had brown hair, hooked noses like the old count's, sharp eyes like knives, wide open and gleaming as if on fire.</t793> <t794>The third was an incredibly beautiful woman with long, shiny blonde hair and eyes as blue as sapphires.</t794> <t795>I found her face somewhat familiar; and my memory took me back to a face I had seen in a nightmare, although at this moment I couldn't recall the exact time and circumstances.</t795> <t796>All three had sparkling white teeth, shining like pearls, peeking out from behind their bright red, sensual lips.</t796> <t797>There was something about them that made me feel uneasy, both desirous and fearful.</t797> <t798>Yes, indeed I very much longed to place a burning kiss on those red lips.</t798> <t799>But perhaps it's best that I don't write such words, for it would make my Mina sad if she read these diary entries, yet I must also say that it is the truth.</t799> <t800>The three women continued whispering to each other, then burst into a melodious, clear laugh, but I find it hard to fully describe, for that laugh contained something that seemed impossible to come from a human throat.</t800> <t801>It was both shrill and gentle, to the point of being unbearable, like the sound of clinking glasses in the hands of a clumsy artist.</t801> <t802>The blonde woman shook her head, seemingly provocatively, leaving the other two to push forward from behind.</t802>
<t803>— Go ahead! - One of them said.</t803> <t804>- I'll let you go first, we'll do it after.</t804>
<t805>— He still looks young and strong. - The second woman spoke up.</t805> <t806>- All three of us will give him a kiss.</t806>
<t807>I lay still, observing the drama through half-closed eyes, feeling as if I were being tormented by an anxious excitement and an indescribable carnal pleasure.</t807>
<t808>The blonde woman approached me, bending close to me, so close that I could even feel her passionate breath: her breath was as gentle and soothing as her voice, but there was something slightly fishy, fishy like the smell of blood.</t808>
<t809>I didn't dare open my eyes wide, but I continued to look through my eyelashes. Even with that, I could completely see the woman now kneeling, bending closer to me, her face joyful and satisfied.</t809> <t810>That face revealed a pleasure full of emotion but also truly disgusting; she licked her lips like a hungry animal, so much so that under the clear moonlight, I could even see the slimy saliva on her ruby-colored lips and on the tip of her red tongue sweeping back and forth over her sharp white teeth.</t810> <t811>She bent lower and lower.</t811> <t812>I had the feeling she was about to press her chili-red lips against my neck.</t812> <t813>But no, she stopped, and I suddenly heard a sound, a sound almost like stirring water.</t813> <t814>It turned out to be the sound of her tongue hitting her teeth and her saliva-filled lips.</t814> <t815>I felt a hot breath blowing on my neck.</t815> <t816>The skin on my neck began to get goosebumps as if being caressed by a smooth hand, and what I was feeling was the trembling caress of her lips along with the very light gnashing of her sharp teeth.</t816> <t817>Pleasure gently passed by, I closed my eyes tightly in a state of ecstasy.</t817> <t818>Thus, I waited, waited, letting my heart throb and stir.</t818>
<t819>But right at that moment, I had to go through another feeling, a feeling that suddenly flashed like lightning.</t819> <t820>The old count was standing there as if he had just fallen from the sky.</t820> <t821>Indeed, when I reluctantly opened my eyes, I saw his iron hand gripping the slender neck of the woman and pulling her back with the tremendous strength of a brutish laborer.</t821> <t822>The woman's blue eyes flashed with anger, her teeth grinding together like a mad beast.</t822> <t823>And the old count?</t823> <t824>Never had I imagined someone swept away by fury like that.</t824> <t825>His eyes blazed with real flames, I even felt those flames had just erupted from the depths of hell.</t825> <t826>His face looked ashen like a corpse, his cheeks twitching continuously, his thick eyebrows furrowing together over his nose like a warped rusty iron bar heated to a white glow.</t826> <t827>He waved his hand, forcefully pushing the woman to the end of the room, then coldly signaled the other two women to immediately leave the room.</t827> <t828>That was the very same wave of the hand I had seen him use before the pack of wolves that day.</t828> <t829>In a deep, almost whispering voice, but enough to tear apart the atmosphere in the room, he spoke to the women:</t829>
<t830>— How dare you do that to him?</t830> <t831>Who gave you permission to gawk at him?</t831> <t832>Get out, I said get out, all of you!</t832> <t833>This man is under my authority. Don't touch him, or else don't blame me.</t833>
<t834>— But have you ever dared to love? You don't dare to love, do you?</t834>
<t835>The remaining two laughed gleefully with each other, their laughter was truly joyous, yet also truly harsh and cruel, making me almost faint.</t835> <t836>Indeed, their laughter was no different from the laughter of demons.</t836>
<t837>Carefully observing me for a moment, the old count then turned and replied, his voice still cold and whispering:</t837>
<t838>— Yes, I can love too.</t838> <t839>Then you all will see that.</t839> <t840>Remember that?</t840> <t841>I promise you all that after finishing the work with him, I will let you do whatever you want with him!</t841> <t842>But for now, leave us alone.</t842> <t843>I have to wake him up, there's still a lot of work waiting for me.</t843>
<t844>— So, we have nothing tonight? - One of the women asked with a laugh, while pointing to the bag the old count had just thrown carelessly on the floor: the bag was moving as if there was a living entity inside.</t844>
<t845>The old count nodded in place of a reply.</t845> <t846>One of the women immediately jumped forward to open the bag.</t846> <t847>I believe I heard a faint moan, like the sound of a child about to suffocate.</t847> <t848>The women gathered around the bag, while I stood frozen in horror.</t848> <t849>But what terrified me even more was that, somehow, the women had suddenly disappeared with the bag, even though my eyes had not left the floor for a second.</t849> <t850>Clearly, there were no doors near them, and if they had left in front of me, I would have seen it.</t850> <t851>They must have vanished with the moonlight through the window, because a moment later, I noticed the familiar shadows just barely outside.</t851> <t852>A moment later, the three shadows disappeared completely.</t852>
<t853>Terror had rendered me lifeless in the realm of unconsciousness.</t853>
<t854>CHAPTER 4</t854>
<t855>Jonathan Harker's Diary (continued)</t855>
<t856>I woke up in bed.</t856><t857>If it is true that I wasn't dreaming last night, then surely the count must have brought me back here.</t857><t858>I tried to calm myself, but I couldn't come to any definite conclusion.</t858><t859>Obviously, I saw things around me that could serve as evidence: for example, my clothes were carefully folded and placed on a chair, which is not my usual habit.</t859><t860>On the other hand, my watch had stopped, even though I always wind it before going to bed.</t860><t861>And there were many other details...</t861><t862>But no, none of this would mean anything if I had been absent-minded last night, or if some reason had caused my mind to be in a whirl.</t862><t863>I need to find concrete evidence.</t863><t864>However, there was still one thing that made me happy: if the count was the one who brought me back here, he must have been in a great hurry, because everything in my pockets was still intact.</t864><t865>Surely, if he found these diary entries, he wouldn't understand anything, because I write in shorthand.</t865><t866>That would annoy him and he would immediately destroy what I had written.</t866><t867>Looking around the room, where despite all the anxiety and fear I had experienced, I still felt that this was the only place I could be safe, because nothing was more terrifying than those dreadful women waiting, waiting to suck my blood.</t867>
<t868>• May 18</t868>
<t869>I want to return to that room in the middle of the day, because I must know the truth at all costs.</t869> <t870>Upon reaching the top of the stairs, I saw the door to the room was still ajar.</t870> <t871>Someone had tried to push the door back to its original position against the standing latch, even though the wooden latch was broken.</t871> <t872>I noticed the door latch was not fastened, and it seemed the door had been closed from the inside.</t872> <t873>Therefore, I fear that I was not dreaming, and from now on, I am compelled to act, starting from this almost certain fact.</t873>
<t874>• May 19</t874>
<t875>Surely, I have fallen into the count's trap; any hope of escape is just a vain dream.</t875> <t876>Last night, with a voice like a spell, he made me write three more letters, informing that I am about to finish my work here and will return in a few days, the second letter stating that I will leave here the very next day.</t876> <t877>The last letter indicates that I have left the castle and am on my way to Bistritz.</t877> <t878>Honestly, I very much wanted to rebel against this coercion, but upon reflection, I realized it would be madness to discuss the count's goodwill, for at this moment I am entirely in his hands; if I do not comply with his demands, I will make him suspicious and provoke his wrath.</t878> <t879>He understands that I know too much about him and could become a danger to him.</t879> <t880>My only chance, if it can still be called that, is to try to prolong the current situation.</t880> <t881>Who knows, an opportunity might arise that allows me to escape...</t881> <t882>I have seen the violence in his eyes when he roughly pushed that beautiful woman.</t882> <t883>He explained to me that the postal service here is very erratic, and the letters would reassure my friends.</t883> <t884>He also told me that with the last letter I have to write, he would have it held in Bistritz until the exact day I am supposed to return, fearing that my stay here might be prolonged.</t884> <t885>He spoke with such conviction that merely opening my mouth to protest would be enough to arouse new suspicions in him.</t885> <t886>So I had to restrain myself.</t886> <t887>I asked him how I should date the letters, and he replied:</t887>
<t888>— The first letter is dated June 12, the second letter is dated June 19, and the third letter is dated June 29.</t888>
<t889>Now I understand how much longer I have to stay here.</t889> <t890>May God protect me!</t890>
<t891>• May 28</t891>
<t892>Maybe I will find a way to escape, or at least send some news back home.</t892> <t893>The Gypsies have returned to the castle and camped in the courtyard.</t893> <t894>I will write a few letters and try to ask them to send them to the post office for me.</t894> <t895>I have started talking to them from my room window, and we have gotten to know each other.</t895> <t896>They express their feelings by bowing very low and trying to communicate with me through gestures, which, to be honest, I don't understand at all.</t896>
<t897>All the letters have been written.</t897> <t898>The letter to Mina I still wrote in shorthand, while the letter to Mr. Hawkins, I only asked him to try to contact Mina.</t898> <t899>I clearly informed my girlfriend of my situation, but did not mention any of the horrors I had experienced.</t899> <t900>She would be terrified if I even hinted at my circumstances.</t900> <t901>Therefore, even if these letters do not reach their destination, the Count cannot suspect the extent to which I have grasped his plans.</t901>
<t902>I threw two letters along with a gold coin out the window to the Gypsies and signaled to them that I wanted them to take the letters to the post office.</t902> <t903>One of them ran to pick up the letters, pressed them to his chest, then bowed to me as per Gypsy custom, and then he put the letters into his hat.</t903> <t904>Now, what else can I do but wait?</t904> <t905>A little later, I wandered into the library to read some books.</t905> <t906>I am writing these lines before the count arrives...</t906>
<t907>However, I was not allowed to sit alone for long; the old count unexpectedly came to sit beside me and spoke to me in his familiar gentle voice while opening two letters to show me:</t907>
<t908>— The Gypsies just handed me these papers. Although I don't understand their origin, I have kept them very carefully! Look here... (so he has already seen the letters).</t908> <t909>This one is yours, addressed to my friend Peter Hawkins; and this one... (upon opening the second letter and seeing the scribbled shorthand, his face darkened, his eyes gleaming with anger and malice)... this one before me is an abomination, it betrays a hospitable friendship!</t909> <t910>Moreover, it doesn't even have a signature! Therefore, it cannot be related to us.</t910>
<t911>Then he calmly put both the envelope and the letter into the desk lamp's flame. After waiting for the papers to burn completely, he turned to me and said:</t911>
<t912>— As for the letter to Mr. Hawkins, which is this remaining letter, I will personally take it to be sent because it is a letter written by you.</t912> <t913>To me, your letters are something truly sacred.</t913> <t914>Surely you will forgive me for opening your letter without permission, won't you, my friend?</t914> <t915>I really didn't know whose letter it was.</t915> <t916>Will you put the letter back into the envelope for me?</t916>
<t917>The old man bowed his head, looking very polite, and handed me a new envelope.</t917> <t918>I could only rewrite the address and reluctantly handed it back to him.</t918> <t919>He bid me farewell and left the library.</t919> <t920>As soon as the door closed, I suddenly heard the faint sound of a key turning in the lock.</t920> <t921>It was a while before I dared to go and try to open it, and indeed the door was tightly locked.</t921>
<t922>It wasn't until one or two hours later that the old count returned to the library, his face still as calm as ever.</t922> <t923>I was startled awake, as I had been lying asleep on the couch.</t923> <t924>He spoke to me in a very cheerful and kind voice.</t924>
<t925>— Tired, aren't you, my friend?</t925> <t926>Then go to bed and lie down.</t926> <t927>That's the place where you can sleep the best.</t927> <t928>Besides, tonight I don't feel like chatting with you, because I have a lot of work to do.</t928> <t929>Go to sleep, I suggest it to you.</t929>
<t930>I went back to my room to lie down, and strangely enough, I had a very peaceful sleep without any dreams at all.</t930> <t931>Disappointment had brought with it a soothing remedy.</t931>
<t932>• May 31</t932>
<t933>My first thought when I woke up this morning was to take a few sheets of paper and some envelopes stored in my travel bag and put them in my jacket pocket, so I could take advantage of any opportunity to write during the day.</t933> <t934>But then another surprise, another shock came to me! All my papers had disappeared, from the meaningless ones to the necessary and unnecessary ones for me if I had the chance to leave the castle.</t934>
<t935>Sitting idly for a while, I suddenly remembered to check the remaining suitcase and the wardrobe where I kept my clothes.</t935> <t936>The set of clothes I intended to take with me for the trip was no longer in the wardrobe, and the cloak, travel blanket... had all disappeared as well.</t936> <t937>I rummaged around aimlessly, but it was all in vain.</t937>
<t938>What kind of scheme is the old man planning with this cat trick?</t938>
<t939>• June 17</t939>
<t940>This morning, while sitting absentmindedly on the edge of the bed, I suddenly heard the sound of a whip cracking outside, followed by the clatter of horse hooves on the gravel path leading to the castle courtyard.</t940> <t941>Feeling a surge of excitement, I rushed to the window and looked down to see two rather large carriages entering, each drawn by eight strong horses, driven by a Slovakian dressed in traditional ethnic attire.</t941> <t942>I quickly turned towards the door with the intention of running down to the main entrance to get to the courtyard, thinking that surely someone would open the door from that side.</t942> <t943>But then another shock: the door was locked tight!</t943>
<t944>I had to return to the window and call down to the yard.</t944> <t945>Everyone looked up at me, pointing and gesturing, looking very surprised.</t945> <t946>At that moment, the leader of the Gypsy group appeared.</t946> <t947>Seeing the group intently looking up at the window, he said something that made everyone burst out laughing.</t947> <t948>So all my efforts were in vain, and now no one even bothered to look up at the window anymore.</t948> <t949>Two horse-drawn carriages arrived carrying large square chests with handles made of very thick rope.</t949> <t950>Judging by the way the Slovakians were handling them and the sound of the chests hitting the ground, I guessed they were empty.</t950> <t951>When everything was piled up in a corner of the yard, the Gypsies paid the Slovakians a few silver coins.</t951> <t952>After receiving the money, the Slovakians turned their horses around and left.</t952> <t953>I stood dazed by the window, listening to the sound of the horse hooves fading away until they were completely gone.</t953>
<t954>• June 24, before dawn</t954>
<t955>Last night, the old count left me quite early to return to his room.</t955> <t956>After he left, I stealthily hurried up the spiral staircase, intending to spy on him from the south window.</t956> <t957>I was certain that something was about to happen.</t957> <t958>The Gypsies had gone off to do something in the castle that I didn't know about, I only knew they were working because occasionally I heard clattering sounds like shovels and picks coming from afar.</t958> <t959>I had a feeling that this must be a sinful act.</t959>
<t960>I stood by the window for nearly half an hour when I saw a shadow lurking at the count's window.</t960> <t961>That dark figure first stuck its head out and then quickly extended its whole body outside.</t961> <t962>It was none other than the count himself.</t962> <t963>But this time, he surprised me even more: he was wearing the clothes I had worn during my journey to the castle, and on his shoulder was the terrifying bag that I had seen disappear with the three women.</t963> <t964>There was no doubt about it, his intention was to use my appearance for some new shady action that I was unaware of.</t964> <t965>It was indeed an extremely cunning trick of his: he intended to make others think it was me.</t965> <t966>By doing so, he could prove to everyone that I was also allowed to go to the city post office or the post offices in neighboring villages to send my letters, and from now on, all his vile actions would have my involvement.</t966>
<t967>I started to feel furious when I thought about all the tricks of that old man, yet they still continued while I was locked up here, imprisoned like a real prisoner without any protection or shelter.</t967> <t968>I decided to just stand by the window waiting for him to return, as there was nothing that made me want to leave where I was standing.</t968> <t969>After a while, I was startled when I saw strange little dots dancing with the moonlight.</t969> <t970>They looked like tiny dust particles swirling around and occasionally gathering together like a small cloud.</t970> <t971>Looking at those dust particles, I suddenly felt a sense of relief in my heart.</t971> <t972>I leaned against the window frame to find a more comfortable position to better observe this strange scene.</t972>
<t973>Suddenly, something startled me—the heavy and groaning cries of the pack of dogs echoed from the valley below.</t973> <t974>Those cries became clearer with each passing moment, and I felt as if the dust particles were transforming into new shapes in response to the distant clamor, though now they were dancing under a weaker moonlight.</t974> <t975>It seemed as though I was straining to awaken the instincts that always slumbered deep within my subconscious, my living soul struggling to respond to those wild calls.</t975> <t976>I was being hypnotized by the bizarre scene unfolding right before my eyes!</t976> <t977>The dust particles danced faster and faster, and the moonbeams also seemed to start dancing near me, then suddenly vanished into the darkness.</t977> <t978>At this moment, even the moonbeams converged to form eerie shapes.</t978> <t979>I jolted once more, the sudden shock brought me back to my senses and restored my self-control; I screamed and ran for my life.</t979> <t980>The eerie shapes gradually separated from the moonlight, and now I could recognize them: they were women, with whom my fate would be intertwined from now on.</t980> <t981>Only when I reached my room did I feel somewhat relieved: here, the moonlight could not penetrate, and only the lamp illuminated every tiny corner.</t981>
<t982>About two hours later, I suddenly heard a sound that resembled the crying of a baby coming from the old count's room.</t982> <t983>But then the shrill and muffled cry quickly faded away, returning the atmosphere to a deep, eerie silence that made my skin crawl.</t983> <t984>I rushed out to open the door, but once again, the door was tightly locked, leaving me completely helpless.</t984> <t985>I could only collapse onto the bed and cry for my fate.</t985>
<t986>That was when I heard a scream in the yard, the painful scream of a woman.</t986> <t987>I went to the window and looked down; indeed, there was a woman with disheveled hair, clutching her chest and crying out in anguish.</t987> <t988>Suddenly seeing me at the window, she screamed loudly, her voice full of threats:</t988>
<t989>— You devil, give me back my child!</t989>
<t990>Then she fell to her knees, raising her hands to the sky, mumbling, her shrill voice repeatedly demanding her child.</t990> <t991>Seeing no one respond, she began tearing her hair, pounding her chest, and performing all sorts of outrageous acts that only those in the utmost agony could do.</t991> <t992>Finally, she rushed towards the front of the castle.</t992> <t993>Even though I could no longer see her, I could still hear the mad pounding on the entrance door.</t993>
<t994>At the same time, I heard the voice of the old count, perhaps echoing down from the castle tower.</t994> <t995>His voice was murmuring, hoarse, and had something like a metallic sound to it.</t995> <t996>And suddenly from afar, the howling of the wolves rose up as if in response to his call.</t996> <t997>Indeed, a few minutes later, a pack of wolves suddenly came rushing into the castle courtyard with a force like floodwaters breaching a dam.</t997>
<t998>The woman barely had time to scream another sound, and the pack of wolves almost immediately fell silent.</t998> <t999>In a flash, I saw them retreating in single file, their tongues hanging out, licking their lips.</t999>
<t1000>Honestly speaking, I have no complaints about that woman, because a misfortunate fate has befallen her child, so it is better to let her go to the afterlife with her unfortunate child.</t1000>
<t1001>What should I do now? What can I do now? How can I escape this long, terrifying night?</t1001>
<t1002>• June 25, morning</t1002>
<t1003>Those who have never experienced terrifying dark nights will not be able to appreciate the gentleness and purity of the early morning.</t1003> <t1004>This morning, when the early sunlight gently perched on the iron fence right outside my window, I thought a peace dove had just landed there! All my fears disappeared like a mist under the sun.</t1004> <t1005>The sunlight restored my courage, so I must act immediately!</t1005> <t1006>Last night, one of those dreadful letters, the letters that could erase my existence from this world, the fateful letters the old count forced me to write, was sent.</t1006> <t1007>It is best not to think too much about them, but to find a way to act?</t1007>
<t1008>During my entire stay at the castle, every night I felt threats, in one way or another, weighing heavily on me, forcing me to believe that I was always facing a danger.</t1008> <t1009>One very strange thing is that since I arrived here, I have not seen the Count even once during the day.</t1009> <t1010>Could it be that he sleeps while others are awake, and only wakes when others have slept? How strange!</t1010> <t1011>How wonderful it would be if I could sneak into his room!</t1011> <t1012>But that is impossible.</t1012> <t1013>His room is always locked, there is no way...</t1013> <t1014>No, there is still a way, but the question is whether I dare to do it or not.</t1014> <t1015>The way the Count uses to sneak outside, why can't I do the same?</t1015> <t1016>I have seen him crawl through the window several times.</t1016> <t1017>Why can't I sneak into his room through that window?</t1017> <t1018>This is indeed a very difficult task, but my current situation is much more desperate.</t1018> <t1019>I will take a risk.</t1019> <t1020>The worst that could happen to me is death.</t1020> <t1021>But the death of a human is not the death of an animal, and perhaps God will grant me eternal life. God will bless me! Mina, farewell if I do not return.</t1021> <t1022>Farewell to my faithful friend, who always regarded me as a second father.</t1022> <t1023>Finally, farewell to all.</t1023> <t1024>Mina, once again, farewell!</t1024>
<t1025>• That same morning, a little while later</t1025>
<t1026>So I managed to get down there, and by the grace of God, I returned to my room without a scratch.</t1026> <t1027>I will explain everything in detail right now.</t1027>
<t1028>At that moment, I don't know why I was so brave! I walked towards the southern window of the castle and immediately climbed onto the narrow stone ledge running along the outer wall.</t1028> <t1029>The stones on the outer edge of the wall were very large and only roughly hewn; as I mentioned, the mortar joints were weathered and crumbling with age.</t1029> <t1030>Setting foot on these precarious stone ledges meant embarking on a deadly adventure.</t1030> <t1031>After climbing a few steps, I tried to look down at the deep abyss below the castle to see if I would get dizzy, but clearly, I didn't dare do so for more than a second.</t1031> <t1032>I had completely determined the position of the count's window and tried to climb there as quickly as possible.</t1032> <t1033>The precariousness of the wall's edge didn't make me dizzy, as I always tried to look straight ahead.</t1033> <t1034>And in what seemed to me to be a very short time, I had climbed to the ledge of the count's window shutter.</t1034>
<t1035>After pushing the door open, I bent my body, stuck my legs in first, and then slid into the room.</t1035> <t1036>I furtively looked around, and luckily the old count was not in the room.</t1036> <t1037>There wasn't much furniture down here, just a few rickety wooden items that seemed like they were never used; each one was covered in dust, some looking very similar to the ones I had seen in the rooms in the southern wing of the castle.</t1037> <t1038>I immediately thought of the key, but it was not in the lock, and I couldn't find it anywhere.</t1038> <t1039>My attention was drawn to a heap of gold coins piled high in the corner of the room - they were coins of various kinds from Romania, England, Austria, Hungary, Greece. These coins seemed to have been there for a long time as they were covered with a thick layer of dust.</t1039> <t1040>All of them were ancient coins dating back at least three hundred years.</t1040> <t1041>I also noticed a few necklaces and some art pieces inlaid with more or less gemstones, but these items were all very old and damaged.</t1041>
<t1042>I walked towards a heavy door that had just been discovered in a corner of the room, because I couldn't find the room key or the castle key. This is something I must not forget and is my main search objective, so I had to rummage around and explore randomly; otherwise, my recent adventurous journey would be of no use at all.</t1042><t1043>This door opened to a corridor with walls entirely built of stone, leading to a spiral staircase.</t1043><t1044>I cautiously stepped down, as this steep staircase was only illuminated by two arrow slits on a very thick wall.</t1044><t1045>At the bottom of the stairs, I found myself in another dark corridor, a real tunnel, filled with a sour, pungent smell that reminded me of the scent of corpses—a smell rising from freshly dug earth.</t1045><t1046>The deeper I went, the stronger that smell became, making it almost unbearable.</t1046><t1047>Finally, I flung open another very thick door in the corridor.</t1047><t1048>I was standing in front of an ancient, dilapidated church, where bodies must have been buried.</t1048><t1049>The church roof was full of holes, and there were many steps on both sides of the walls leading to the crypts.</t1049><t1050>I noticed the freshly dug earth and shovels of dirt filling large scattered crates around: these were surely the wooden crates that the Slovak men had just transported.</t1050><t1051>There was no one in the church.</t1051><t1052>I continued to grope around: who knows, maybe there was an exit inside?</t1052><t1053>No, there was no exit at all.</t1053><t1054>I continued to inspect more thoroughly.</t1054><t1055>And despite my great disgust, I still barged into the crypts, where faint light was emanating.</t1055><t1056>In the first two crypts, I found nothing but fragments of old coffins and dust.</t1056><t1057>Entering the third crypt, I suddenly jumped when I discovered something.</t1057>
<t1058>The old count was lying heavily on a chest placed on a pile of freshly dug earth?</t1058> <t1059>I couldn't tell if he was dead or sleeping, as his eyes were still wide open, lifeless like stone eyes, but not dull like those of a dead person.</t1059> <t1060>His cheeks, though ashen, seemed to still retain the warmth of life, and his lips were still as red as they usually were.</t1060> <t1061>However, his body was completely motionless, showing no signs of breathing, and his heart seemed to have stopped beating in his chest.</t1061> <t1062>Despite this, I still bent down with the hope that he had just lain there, as the smell of the earth was still very fresh.</t1062> <t1063>The lid of the chest, full of holes, was propped up against the pile of earth.</t1063> <t1064>I thought the keys might be kept in the pockets of the clothes he was wearing, but when I intended to approach him to search, I lost my nerve. Clearly, in my presence, his eyes remained lifeless and showed no sign of awareness, yet the lingering hatred in those wide-open eyes made me immediately flee, return to his room, climb out the window, and crawl back up the wall.</t1064> <t1065>When I got back to my room, I collapsed on the bed, breathing heavily. I tried to piece together all my thoughts.</t1065>
<t1066>• June 29</t1066>
<t1067>Today is the day I send my last letter.</t1067> <t1068>The old count surely hasn't forgotten about this, for once again I saw him leave the castle through the window, while still wearing my clothes.</t1068> <t1069>Watching him crawl down the wall like a lizard, I had only one desire: to grab a gun or any deadly weapon and give him a shot!</t1069> <t1070>Although I don't know if such a weapon would have any effect on him.</t1070> <t1071>I didn't dare to wait for his return, because at this moment I was truly afraid of seeing the deadly trio once again.</t1071> <t1072>I went back to the library to find a book to read for distraction; but after a short while, I fell asleep.</t1072>
<t1073>The appearance of the count woke me up.</t1073> <t1074>He spoke to me, his voice full of menace:</t1074>
<t1075>— My friend, tomorrow we will bid each other farewell.</t1075> <t1076>You will return to your beautiful England.</t1076> <t1077>In the future, we may not meet again.</t1077> <t1078>The letter you wrote to your loved ones has been sent to the post office.</t1078> <t1079>Tomorrow I will not be here, but everything necessary for your journey has been meticulously prepared.</t1079> <t1080>The Gypsies will come here in the morning, as they have work to do, and so will the Slovak people.</t1080> <t1081>When they leave, my carriage will come to find you and take you to the Borgo Pass, where you will catch the coach to Bistritz.</t1081> <t1082>But in any case, I still hope to have the pleasure of welcoming you again at Dracula's castle!</t1082>
<t1083>Hearing that, I decided to test how honest the old count really was.</t1083> <t1084>I felt as if I was desecrating this thought by imagining a demon. I suddenly asked him:</t1084>
<t1085>— Why can't I leave tonight?</t1085>
<t1086>— My dear friend, because my coachman and the horses are all currently occupied.</t1086>
<t1087>— But I would be very pleased if that were the case.</t1087> <t1088>To be honest with you, I want to leave here immediately.</t1088>
<t1089>The old man smiled, a smile that was both gentle and mischievous, a smile in which I could easily discern the dark intentions hidden behind that chilling gentleness.</t1089>
<t1090>— What about your luggage, sir? - He asked.</t1090>
<t1091>— It doesn't matter.</t1091> <t1092>- I replied. - I can get it later.</t1092>
<t1093>The old man stood up and bowed to me, his gesture was so polite that I almost had to rub my eyes because I couldn't believe he could be so sincere.</t1093>
<t1094>— Your English people have a proverb that I really like, because it clearly reflects the spirit in the behavior of those of us from noble lineage: "Please the guest who comes, satisfy the guest who leaves!" Follow me, my dear young friend, you will not have to stay here another hour reluctantly, although I am truly sad to part with you and when you are so eager to leave early.</t1094> <t1095>Here again?</t1095>
<t1096>The old man solemnly held the lamp and led me down the stairs, then continued towards the main door of the castle.</t1096> <t1097>But when we reached the middle of the hallway, he suddenly stopped.</t1097>
<t1098>— Listen! - He told me.</t1098>
<t1099>There was the howl of a pack of wolves not far from the castle.</t1099> <t1100>He raised his hand, and it seemed that the howls rose in unison with his gesture, like an orchestra obeying the conductor's baton.</t1100> <t1101>A moment later, still with that majestic demeanor, he continued walking.</t1101> <t1102>Upon reaching the castle gate, he pulled out the latch, dragged down the heavy chains, and slowly opened the door.</t1102> <t1103>I was surprised: the door was not locked.</t1103> <t1104>Not believing it to be true, I looked around in bewilderment, but still saw no sign of a key.</t1104>
<t1105>The wider the door opened, the more ferocious the wolves' howls became.</t1105> <t1106>The beasts, each one baring its teeth and sticking out its blood-red tongue, looked very menacing, with some even grinding their teeth.</t1106> <t1107>I had no idea when they appeared outside the door.</t1107> <t1108>I suddenly realized I couldn't resist the count's will.</t1108> <t1109>What could I do to oppose him, when he had such terrifying allies?</t1109> <t1110>However, the door continued to open slowly, and the count calmly stood right at the threshold.</t1110> <t1111>A thought suddenly flashed through my mind: perhaps my destined hour had come; I would be thrown out as prey for the wolves, because I wished it so.</t1111> <t1112>This insidious move must have greatly pleased the count.</t1112> <t1113>And as if there were no other choice, I was forced to cry out in search of one last stroke of luck:</t1113>
<t1114>— Close the door! I will wait!</t1114> <t1115>So, I will go in the morning?</t1115>
<t1116>Having said only that, I covered my face with my hands to hide the bitter, despairing tears.</t1116>
<t1117>The iron hand of the old count pulled the heavy door shut and latched the bolts, the clanking of metal echoing dully in the hallway.</t1117>
<t1118>No one said a word to each other, we returned to the library, but seeing no reason to stay there, I went straight back to my room.</t1118> <t1119>The last time I looked back at Count Dracula, I saw him just raise his hand to blow me a kiss, his eyes gleaming with a triumphant look along with a sinister smile that even the devil Judas would be proud of.</t1119>
<t1120>I was about to lie down in bed when I suddenly heard what seemed like someone whispering outside the door.</t1120> <t1121>I tiptoed closer to listen.</t1121> <t1122>I believed I recognized the voice of the old count:</t1122>
<t1123>— No, no.</t1123> <t1124>- The voice still rose. - Turn back, all of you! Now is not the time for you.</t1124> <t1125>Just wait!</t1125> <t1126>You must be patient! Tonight will be mine, the next night will be yours!</t1126>
<t1127>In response to the count's words were mocking giggles.</t1127> <t1128>Infuriated, I flung the door open, and in front of me stood three women licking their lips.</t1128> <t1129>Recognizing me, they burst into more lewd and malicious laughter before leaving.</t1129>
<t1130>I staggered back in and collapsed onto the floor.</t1130> <t1131>Could it be that my end is coming so soon?</t1131> <t1132>Tomorrow! Tomorrow! Dear God! Please save me, save all my loved ones!</t1132>
<t1133>• June 30, morning</t1133>
<t1134>Perhaps these will be the last lines I can write in this diary.</t1134> <t1135>Immediately after waking up before dawn, I hurriedly knelt down on the floor, because if my final hour had come, I wanted the Grim Reaper to see that I was ready.</t1135>
<t1136>Kneeling for a while, I began to sense that the early morning atmosphere was undergoing a subtle, indescribable change... and the morning was still coming... as the first rooster crowed.</t1136> <t1137>I felt as if I was narrowly escaping death.</t1137> <t1138>I opened the door, walked down the stairs with a lighter heart.</t1138> <t1139>The castle gate was clearly unlocked, which meant I had another chance to escape!</t1139> <t1140>Impatiently, I unchained and unlatched it, my hands trembling.</t1140>
<t1141>But the door did not budge at all.</t1141> <t1142>The discouragement and despair within me gradually reached their peak.</t1142> <t1143>I threw myself against the door in the hope of finding an escape, but it was all in vain.</t1143> <t1144>It was only then that I realized the door had been locked right after I parted ways with the old count.</t1144> <t1145>However, I kept telling myself that by any means necessary, I had to find and get that wretched key; I would climb the wall again and sneak into the count's room.</t1145> <t1146>Surely, I would face death if he caught me in his room, but among the worst things that could happen to me, death seemed to be the least of them.</t1146> <t1147>Without wasting a minute, I immediately climbed through the window and descended into the count's room.</t1147> <t1148>The room was empty.</t1148> <t1149>I couldn't find the key anywhere.</t1149> <t1150>The pile of gold coins was still there.</t1150> <t1151>I followed the stairs and the dark corridors I had taken before to reach the church.</t1151> <t1152>I knew very well where the demon I was looking for was lying.</t1152>
<t1153>The large chest still lay in its old place, close to the wall, but this time it was carefully covered, the lid of the chest was pre-nailed as if waiting for hammer blows.</t1153> <t1154>I knew that I had to search the corpse inside to possibly find the key.</t1154> <t1155>Therefore, I had to lift the lid of the chest and lean it against the wall, the corpse inside the chest terrified me?</t1155>
<t1156>Yes, it was still the old count lying there, but now he looked half his age, as his white hair and beard had turned a grayish ash color; his cheeks appeared fuller and even seemed to have a fresh pink hue beneath the pale skin.</t1156><t1157>Especially his lips, which now looked plumper than ever, with fresh blood dripping from the corners, streaming down his chin and neck.</t1157><t1158>His deep-set, glaring eyes were lost in a swollen face.</t1158><t1159>I had the impression that this terrifying monster lived solely on fresh blood.</t1159><t1160>The mere thought of bending down to touch him made me shudder; the contact filled me with a sense of revulsion, but no matter what, I had to find what I was looking for, or I would fail!</t1160><t1161>And thus, my body could become a plaything for the three dreadful women the next night.</t1161><t1162>I gritted my teeth and searched all the pockets on his person, but still couldn't find the key.</t1162><t1163>The count's bloated face seemed to mock me, driving me to the brink of madness.</t1163><t1164>Yet, I had spent countless efforts to help him move closer to London, where he could continue to satiate his insatiable bloodlust for centuries to come, turning the weak into half-human, half-monster creatures.</t1164><t1165>The mere thought of it was unbearable.</t1165><t1166>Thinking this, I furiously grabbed the shovel lying on the ground and aimed to strike the count's hideous face.</t1166><t1167>But at that moment, the count's head slightly turned to one side, and his gleaming, malevolent eyes met mine.</t1167><t1168>I froze as if paralyzed, my hand dropped, causing the shovel to make a deep cut on his forehead.</t1168><t1169>The shovel slipped from my hand, fell into the coffin, and got caught in the wooden lid.</t1169><t1170>I was about to bend down to grab the shovel handle when the coffin lid suddenly slammed shut, sparing me from the ghastly sight below.</t1170><t1171>The last detail I saw was the bloated, blood-stained face with a sinister, mocking grin that could only belong in hell.</t1171>
<t1172>I stood there, dazed, thinking about what I would have to do, but clearly, I couldn't think of anything.</t1172><t1173>My body felt heavy, despondent, powerless...</t1173><t1174>I kept standing, standing, until suddenly the singing of the Gypsies echoed from afar.</t1174><t1175>The singing grew closer and closer, accompanied by the rhythmic sound of horse hooves.</t1175><t1176>As the old count had told me last night, the Gypsies and even the Slovaks were coming to the castle.</t1176><t1177>After glancing around and taking one last look at the chest containing the cursed corpse, I hurried back to the old man's room, intending to escape right when the gate opened.</t1177><t1178>I strained my ears to listen: there was the sound of a key turning in a large lock, followed by the heavy creaking of a door on the ground floor.</t1178><t1179>So, either there were other entrances to the castle, or someone with a key had opened one of the doors I knew about.</t1179><t1180>Then, I heard the varying sounds of many footsteps in some hallway.</t1180><t1181>I turned back and ran towards the church, thinking there might be an exit I hadn't seen yet.</t1181><t1182>But just then, a sudden strong gust of wind slammed the door leading to the spiral staircase shut, causing dust to fly everywhere.</t1182><t1183>I hurriedly ran back, but it was too late, the door was locked.</t1183><t1184>So, I became a prisoner again.</t1184><t1185>The net of fate was tightening around me.</t1185>
<t1186>As I write these lines, I hear heavy footsteps and the sound of something being thrown... yes... it must be the boxes filled with earth in the hallway below.</t1186> <t1187>Then there is the sound of hammering.</t1187> <t1188>The people from earlier are nailing shut the lid of the box that I had just knocked over.</t1188> <t1189>A moment later, I hear the sound of heavy footsteps in the hallway again, followed by lighter footsteps.</t1189> <t1190>The last sounds that reach my ears are the slamming of a door, the clinking of a chain, the turning of a lock, the removal of a key from the lock, and then the opening and closing of another door.</t1190> <t1191>I can still hear the sound of a key turning and a latch being fastened once more.</t1191>
<t1192>Outside in the yard, at the far end, on the gravel path, the sound of a horse-drawn carriage slowly receded along with the clattering of horse hooves.</t1192> <t1193>The sad song of the Gypsy once again soared faintly and then faded away in my ears.</t1193> <t1194>So, I was left alone in the castle, alone with those three women!</t1194> <t1195>Women! Mina is also a woman, but she has nothing in common with them.</t1195> <t1196>Are they just female demons?</t1196>
<t1197>But I will not stay alone with them.</t1197> <t1198>Then I will climb the wall again, farther than I have ever done before, and I will take the gold coins from the count's room because I might need that money later.</t1198> <t1199>I absolutely must leave this cursed castle to return to my loved ones!</t1199> <t1200>The first train, and the fastest one, will take me away from this hellish place, away from this damned land where demons and monstrous creations live as they have always lived in this world full of ironies!</t1200>
<t1201>CHAPTER 5</t1201>
<t1202>Letter from Mina Murray to Lucy Westenra</t1202>
<t1203>"May 9"</t1203>
<t1204>Dear Lucy.</t1204>
<t1205>Sorry for my prolonged silence, but actually, I haven't encountered any troubles; it's simply because I'm always swamped with work, that's all.</t1205>
<t1206>The life of a female trainer is not always easy.</t1206> <t1207>How I long to walk with you along the beach and chat about everything under the sun.</t1207> <t1208>Yes, these days I've been burying myself in work because I want to be capable enough to collaborate with Jonathan.</t1208> <t1209>I've been diligently practicing shorthand, so that when we get married, I can help him record everything he deems necessary and then type it out.</t1209> <t1210>I'm also learning to type now.</t1210> <t1211>Moreover, we both often receive letters written in shorthand, and I know that during his travels, he also keeps a diary in that way.</t1211> <t1212>When I return to you, I will do the same.</t1212> <t1213>I will keep a diary and whenever I feel like it, I will jot down everything that comes to mind.</t1213> <t1214>Maybe one day, I will show that diary to Jonathan if needed.</t1214> <t1215>But first, I will treat it as an exercise book.</t1215> <t1216>I want to do what female journalists often do: conduct interviews, describe what I see, try to recall stories I've heard, and then recount everything as truthfully as possible.</t1216> <t1217>Someone told me that with just a bit of practice, one can easily remember everything that happened, or everything heard during the day.</t1217> <t1218>In the end, we will see...</t1218> <t1219>I'm very happy to share with you my little plans.</t1219> <t1220>I just received a few words from Jonathan sent from Transylvania.</t1220>
<t1221>He is still healthy and will return here in about a week.</t1221> <t1222>I'm very excited to hear Jonathan talk about his trip.</t1222> <t1223>The trip must have been wonderful because it spanned so many lands.</t1223> <t1224>I'm wondering if the day when we, I mean Jonathan and I, will travel together will ever come.</t1224> <t1225>Alright, it's already ten o'clock now.</t1225> <t1226>Goodbye!</t1226>
<t1227>Sending you warm greetings,</t1227>
<t1228>Mine.</t1228>
<t1229>T. B. When you write to me, remember to tell me everything! It's been a long time since you've done that.</t1229> <t1230>I believe I will hear about some tall, handsome guy with curly hair??</t1230><t1231>?”</t1231>
<t1232>Letter from Lucy Westenra to Mina Murray</t1232>
<t1233>“Wednesday, the 17th, Chatham Street.</t1233>
<t1234>Dear Mina,</t1234>
<t1235>To be honest, you were a bit too harsh in criticizing me: I have written to you twice since we parted ways, and your latest letter is only the second one I have received?</t1235> <t1236>Moreover, I don't have anything new to tell you; honestly, there's nothing worth your attention.</t1236> <t1237>These days, we go out quite often, sometimes to art exhibitions, sometimes for walks or horseback riding in the park.</t1237> <t1238>As for the tall, handsome guy with blond hair you mentioned, I think you were referring to the guy who accompanied me to a recent concert.</t1238> <t1239>Clearly, you've heard some rumors...</t1239> <t1240>That was Holmwood.</t1240>
<t1241>He often visits my house; my mother and he seem to get along very well.</t1241> <t1242>They usually care about the same things.</t1242> <t1243>At least that's what I think.</t1243> <t1244>Recently, we met someone like you mentioned, and I was planning to set you up with him if you weren't Jonathan's fiancée.</t1244> <t1245>Isn't that a wonderful match?</t1245> <t1246>A handsome, elegant, wealthy, and very knowledgeable young man.</t1246> <t1247>He is a very intelligent doctor.</t1247> <t1248>Can you imagine, at just twenty-nine years old, he is already able to run a very large sanatorium.</t1248>
<t1249>It was Holmwood who introduced him to me.</t1249> <t1250>These days, he often comes to my house.</t1250> <t1251>I believe he is the most resilient, determined, and at the same time, the calmest man I have ever met in my life.</t1251> <t1252>I sense in him an unshakeable resoluteness.</t1252>
<t1253>He also always lingers in the eyes of others, as if he wants to read all their thoughts.</t1253> <t1254>He often acts according to my interests, but I am very glad to tell you that he is far from achieving his goal!</t1254> <t1255>For me right now, just being able to look at myself in the mirror is enough. Have you ever tried reading your own expression in the mirror?</t1255> <t1256>That psychiatrist said that to him, I am quite a peculiar mental case, and although it's uncomfortable, I still think he's right.</t1256> <t1257>Mental illness! How amusing?</t1257>
<t1258>You know, I'm not the kind of person who pays much attention to fashion to be able to describe to you what's trending.</t1258><t1259>Fashion is just a frivolous thing, as Arthur often says...</t1259><t1260>All that is called new to me is just that.</t1260><t1261>Mina, do you remember, from our youthful days, we used to share with each other our deepest secrets; we used to sleep together, share every piece of cake, every smile, and even tears? You know, now I really want to talk, to chat endlessly with you! Mina!</t1261><t1262>Can you guess?</t1262><t1263>I love him!</t1263><t1264>I'm blushing as I write these words, because even if I have enough reason to believe that he loves me too, he hasn't said it to me yet.</t1264><t1265>Mina, I love him! I love him?</t1265><t1266>I love him! That's it!</t1266><t1267>Only by writing this do I feel at ease.</t1267><t1268>If only I could be with you now, sitting close to you by the fire in casual clothes to confide like the old days; we would whisper to each other, and I would try to share with you all the emotions I've been through.</t1268><t1269>I don't know how to express my innermost feelings, even to you...</t1269><t1270>I'm afraid I have to stop writing here, because if I don't, I might tear this letter apart.</t1270><t1271>Honestly, I still don't want to stop writing, because I still crave to tell you something more.</t1271><t1272>Reply to me right away, tell me frankly what you think. Mina, I'm stopping here.</t1272><t1273>Goodbye.</t1273><t1274>Pray to God to bless me and my happiness, Mina.</t1274>
<t1275>Luccy.</t1275>
<t1276>T. B. It's useless to tell you this is a secret, isn't it Mina? Once again, goodbye! L...”</t1276>
<t1277>Letter from Lucy Westenra to Mina Murray</t1277>
<t1278>"May 24"</t1278>
<t1279>Dear Mina.</t1279>
<t1280>Thank you, thank you, and thank you very much for your lovely letter.</t1280><t1281>I am very happy to confide in you and to know that you understand me very well.</t1281><t1282>Dear friend, until now I have truly felt the saying: "Fortune comes in pairs" is correct?</t1282><t1283>This September, I will turn twenty, and until now, I have never received a serious marriage proposal from anyone, but do you know what? Today, I received proposals from three different people?</t1283><t1284>Yes, three marriage proposals in just one day?</t1284><t1285>It's quite overwhelming, isn't it? But I also feel a bit sad, truly sad for the two unfortunate men, because whether I want to or not, I can only choose one.</t1285><t1286>But you must remember not to tell anyone, okay? I don't want to hear any gossip, rumors, or jealousy at all!</t1286><t1287>Now, perhaps I will tell you about all three, will you promise to keep it a secret for me? Of course, if you want, you can tell Jonathan, but only him.</t1287><t1288>A woman usually has to tell her husband everything, right, dear friend?</t1288><t1289>Now I will tell you one by one: the first person came around twelve o'clock, just as the family was sitting down for lunch.</t1289><t1290>As I told you before: it was Dr. John Seward, the director of the mental asylum, a man with a determined chin and a very high forehead.</t1290><t1291>On the outside, he seemed completely calm, but I guess it was more like tension.</t1291><t1292>He showed himself to be a person with very impressive manners.</t1292><t1293>However, he was so clumsy that he almost sat on the hat he had just placed on the chair, something that men generally wouldn't do if they had a cool head.</t1293><t1294>And to appear natural, he took out a scalpel to play with, and for some reason, every time I saw it, I felt terrified?</t1294><t1295>But Mina, he was very honest in his conversation.</t1295><t1296>He said that he expected a lot from me even though we hadn't known each other for long, that life for him would become wonderful if I were there to help, encourage, and comfort him.</t1296><t1297>He wanted me to understand that his sadness would disappear when I was there, but when he saw the tears on my face, he panicked and called himself heartless, saying he didn't want to make me more upset.</t1297><t1298>He only asked if time would make me love him or not.</t1298><t1299>I shook my head, my hands trembling and feeling a bit hesitant inside.</t1299><t1300>He also inquired if I had already loved someone else and said that when a girl's heart doesn't belong to anyone, a man like him could still hope and wait.</t1300><t1301>So, Mina, at that moment, I felt it was my duty to confess that I was in love with someone.</t1301><t1302>Hearing that, he immediately stood up, his face very serious but still trying to appear calm, and took my hands with wishes for happiness.</t1302><t1303>He also said that if I ever needed a friend, a truly devoted friend, I could trust him.</t1303><t1304>Dear Mina, do you know, writing to you, I can't hold back my feelings.</t1304><t1305>I'm sure you'll forgive me when you see the dried tears on this page, won't you, dear friend?</t1305><t1306>Being proposed to is the best thing for a girl, but I assure you that no one is happy to see a sincere young man leave with a broken heart, knowing very well that no matter what he says, I will completely disappear from his life.</t1306><t1307>Dear Mina, perhaps I should stop writing here, I can't write any more about it, I am very sad, although I still feel truly happy inside!.</t1307>
<t1308>Evening.</t1308>
<t1309>Arthur just left, and now I feel much more relieved than when I paused my writing.</t1309> <t1310>So I can continue telling you about a day in my life.</t1310> <t1311>The second character arrived in the afternoon.</t1311> <t1312>He was a very interesting young man, an American from Texas.</t1312> <t1313>He looked so young that I couldn't believe he had traveled to so many countries and witnessed countless events! Now I feel sympathy for poor Desdemona and understand what she went through when hearing about a bunch of fascinating stories, even if the storyteller was a black man?</t1313> <t1314>We girls are often scared of everything, so we always think of a man who can protect, ensure, and marry us.</t1314> <t1315>If I were a man, I would completely know how to win a girl's heart.</t1315> <t1316>But no, after all, I know nothing, because I see that if Morris - the American guy I just mentioned - doesn't hesitate to tell everyone about all his adventures, Arthur doesn't tell anything at all, and although...</t1316> <t1317>But never mind, I'm going too fast...</t1317> <t1318>Quincey P. Morris met me at home when I was alone.</t1318> <t1319>When a boy comes to meet a girl, she is always alone, as if by coincidence.</t1319> <t1320>No, this is not entirely true, because Arthur has tried twice to arrange to meet me alone and I also facilitated it: coincidence means nothing at all, now I can assert this without any shame.</t1320> <t1321>I also want to tell you that Morris doesn't always use slang.</t1321>
<t1322>Indeed, he never behaves that way in front of foreigners, as he is a very well-educated person with a very clear manner of conduct.</t1322> <t1323>But when he realized that I was very happy to hear American slang, and seeing that there was no one at home to be offended by it, he also said many really funny things?</t1323> <t1324>My dear friend, I have to wonder if he made up those situations, because every story he told had a specific implication that he wanted to convey.</t1324> <t1325>Maybe I also need to learn the habit of speaking slang.</t1325> <t1326>I don't know if I will do that in the future, and I also don't know if Arthur would like it, as I have never heard him say a single slang word.</t1326> <t1327>And then that guy Morris sat down next to me, looking delighted and happy, though still very tense.</t1327> <t1328>He held my hand tightly for a long time and then whispered, in a very gentle voice:</t1328>
<t1329>— At this moment, I know I am not worthy to tie your shoes, but I think if we keep waiting, it will be a long time before you find such a man.</t1329> <t1330>Don't you want the two of us to make a saddle together, and then ride together on the same horse?</t1330>
<t1331>Honestly speaking, I find him so humorous that if I were to reject his proposal, he wouldn't be as sad as poor Dr. Seward.</t1331> <t1332>I also responded to him in a humorous tone that I had no idea how to saddle a horse, and that up until now, I still didn't like being put on horseback.</t1332>
<t1333>He apologized for speaking too softly and suggested that I let him make it up to me on an occasion he deemed important and serious.</t1333> <t1334>When he said these things, he looked so despondent and solemn that I couldn't help but feel moved.</t1334> <t1335>And before I could say anything more, he hurriedly poured out a stream of affectionate words, then expressed all his soul and feelings.</t1335> <t1336>Once again, he confided his feelings with such genuine seriousness that I completely forgot his humorous demeanor from before.</t1336> <t1337>He must have read something on my face that made him worried, because he suddenly stopped and then spoke to me in a more enthusiastic and courageous tone.</t1337> <t1338>If my heart had not already been occupied by someone else, I might have fallen in love with him just for that enthusiasm:</t1338>
<t1339>— Lucy, you are indeed a sincere and virtuous girl.</t1339> <t1340>I wouldn't be here talking to you if I didn't understand that, if I didn't understand that you are honest and straightforward.</t1340> <t1341>So let me ask you honestly, when it's just the two of us sitting face to face like two friends here, are you in love with someone?</t1341> <t1342>If that's the case, then I will never bother you again, but if you want, I will be ready to become a very loyal friend of yours.</t1342>
<t1343>Dear Mina, why do men always possess such noble souls, while we girls always think badly of them?</t1343>
<t1344>At that moment, I suddenly realized that for the past half hour, I had only been joking around, while he wanted clarity and decisiveness from me.</t1344> <t1345>I cried again, because I was very sad, very unhappy.</t1345> <t1346>Why can't a girl marry three men, especially when she really has the opportunity to do so?</t1346> <t1347>Do you think that would save us from so much distress?</t1347> <t1348>Despite the tears welling up, I still tried to look Morris straight in the eye and answer frankly as he had just spoken:</t1348>
<t1349>— Yes, I have loved someone, even though he hasn't told me that he loves me.</t1349>
<t1350>I immediately understood that I had acted correctly by addressing the issue directly with him, because at that moment his face lit up, he tightly grasped both of my hands (even though I thought I had placed my hands in his) and said in the most affectionate voice:</t1350>
<t1351>— You truly are a sincere and faithful girl!</t1351> <t1352>Don't cry anymore, dear Lucy; if you are worried about me, then please don't be troubled: I am used to difficult times and this time I will endure it as well.</t1352> <t1353>But if that guy still hasn't realized his happiness, he will soon understand that he is highly valued, otherwise he will have to deal with me.</t1353> <t1354>Little girl, your honesty, courage, and sincerity show that you can become a truly valuable friend, more valuable than love itself.</t1354> <t1355>Dear Lucy, perhaps loneliness will be my companion in the remaining days of my life.</t1355> <t1356>Will you give me a kiss, just one, won't you?</t1356> <t1357>It will be a sweet memory that brightens my dark nights.</t1357> <t1358>Say that you can do this once for me, because that guy must be very handsome, very charming, and also very clever, otherwise you wouldn't love him while he still hasn't confessed to you yet.</t1358>
<t1359>Mina, indeed, his words truly moved me: to speak about a rival in such a manner, especially when feeling down, isn't that an admirable gesture?</t1359> <t1360>I leaned in and gently placed a kiss on his lips.</t1360> <t1361>He stood up, still holding my hand tightly, gazing at my face for a long while, making me blush, then said:</t1361>
<t1362>— Little girl, I have held your hands, and you have given me a kiss. If that does not strengthen our friendship, then surely it cannot lead to anything else.</t1362> <t1363>Thank you for your kindness and sincerity, goodbye!</t1363>
<t1364>He gently let go of my hands, then took his hat and quickly walked out the door without looking back, without crying, without lingering, and without stopping.</t1364> <t1365>As for me, I just stood there crying like a child.</t1365> <t1366>Oh! Why does a man like him have to endure such misfortune, while there are so many girls in this world ready to follow in his footsteps?</t1366> <t1367>I would do the same if my heart wasn't already occupied by someone else.</t1367> <t1368>Dear, all of this has left me completely confused.</t1368> <t1369>Right now, I can't even describe my happiness, and besides, I've been rambling quite a lot already.</t1369> <t1370>And I don't want to say anything to you about the third person when my happiness is still incomplete.</t1370>
<t1371>Always be your friend,</t1371>
<t1372>Lucy.</t1372>
<t1373>T. B. Oh! Character number three...</t1373> <t1374>But do I really need to tell you about this character?</t1374> <t1375>Moreover, everything is still very unclear to me.</t1375> <t1376>It seems like when he walked into the living room and held me tightly in his arms, placing kisses on my lips just a few minutes apart.</t1376> <t1377>I was so happy, happy to the point of madness!</t1377> <t1378>And I still don't know what to do to deserve this happiness.</t1378> <t1379>From now on, I can only show God that I am very grateful to Him for giving me a love, a husband, and a friend.</t1379>
<t1380>Goodbye, sweetheart!</t1380>

<t1382>May 25</t1382>
<t1383>Today is truly a sad day.</t1383> <t1384>The food doesn't taste good, and I can't sleep either.</t1384> <t1385>So I thought about writing in my diary again.</t1385> <t1386>Yesterday, since being rejected in my marriage proposal, I have felt like I'm living in emptiness, as if nothing is worth my concern anymore.</t1386> <t1387>Understanding that the only remedy for this mood is work, I have focused all my efforts on taking care of the patients.</t1387> <t1388>I examined a case that I considered the most special.</t1388> <t1389>The behavior of this patient was so peculiar that I decided to put in all the necessary effort to grasp everything that was going on inside him.</t1389> <t1390>Finally, I began to vaguely sense the mystery of his being.</t1390>
<t1391>To understand the hallucinations in the patient's mind, I had to ask him more questions than usual.</t1391> <t1392>Now I realize that doing so was somewhat cruel.</t1392> <t1393>It was almost like I was deliberately pushing him to only talk about his madness - something I always avoid doing with my patients, just as I avoid falling into the brink of hell.</t1393> <t1394>(Note: in what circumstances might I not avoid falling into the brink of hell?) Omnia Romae venalia sunt!</t1394> <t1395>If there is something real behind this instinctive behavior, then understanding its exact nature is also worth doing, and should start right now...</t1395>
<t1396>Patient Renfield, number 59.</t1396> <t1397>Hot-tempered, physically healthy, easily agitated, cyclically fatigued, leading to prejudices that I still cannot explain.</t1397> <t1398>I have the impression that a hot-tempered person, if unbalanced, can be completely irrational; and such people can become very dangerous depending on their selfishness.</t1398> <t1399>In selfish individuals, the instinct for self-preservation acts as a shield that both protects their opponents and themselves.</t1399> <t1400>I believe that when the ego has a firm position, the centripetal force will balance with the centrifugal force, and duty will form the fixed point, the centrifugal force will push it away, and only one or a series of random coincidences can restore the balance.</t1400>

<t1420>Mina Murray's Diary</t1420>
<t1421>• Whitby, July 24</t1421>
<t1422>Lucy went looking for me just as I got off the train, and she looked prettier and more charming than ever.</t1422> <t1423>We went straight to the Crescent Moon Hotel, where she and her mother had booked a few rooms.</t1423> <t1424>It was a mesmerizing place, with the little Esk River flowing through a deep valley that gradually widened into the surrounding areas of the harbor.</t1424> <t1425>Connecting the two sides of the valley was a viaduct perched high on tall pillars; from the bridge, the landscape stretched out endlessly as if in an unreal world.</t1425> <t1426>The valley was truly beautiful with precarious mountains covered in lush green.</t1426> <t1427>If you stood on one of the peaks and looked down, you would be amazed to see a small stream shimmering with silver light flowing lazily to a deep abyss at the bottom of the dark green valley.</t1427> <t1428>The roofs in the old city were all tiled with red tiles, and they seemed to overlap each other like the scenes we often see in paintings depicting the Nuremberg area. Leaving the city, you would immediately come to the ruins of the old Whitby Abbey, which was ravaged by the Danes long ago and also served as a lifelong prison for young girls in the area.</t1428> <t1429>These vast ruins would give you a grand and majestic sense of the surrounding landscape.</t1429> <t1430>There is a legend that occasionally... a lady dressed entirely in white appears by a window in the evening.</t1430> <t1431>Between the old city and the ruins is a church bell tower surrounded by a cemetery.</t1431> <t1432>In my view, this is the most beautiful place in Whitby: here you can take in the entire view of the harbor and a small bay, where a headland juts out into the sea.</t1432> <t1433>At the harbor, this headland is so steep that its edges have eroded into the water, causing some graves - as the cemetery extends to this point - to collapse as well.</t1433> <t1434>You can also enjoy the shaded paths running through the cemetery, with scattered benches inviting passersby to rest and enjoy the scenery for hours, while the gentle sea breeze softly caresses them.</t1434> <t1435>I often come here to sit and work.</t1435> <t1436>In fact, right now, I am sitting here scribbling in a notebook on my lap, while a few old men chat about the weather right next to me.</t1436>
<t1437>Below my feet is the harbor, and on the other side is a stone wall stretching out to the sea, ending at a curved shore with a lone lighthouse standing in the middle.</t1437> <t1438>The scenery becomes more poetic when the tide rises, but when the sea water recedes, everything becomes barren, leaving only the Esk stream diligently flowing between the sand dunes winding around a series of solitary rock outcrops.</t1438> <t1439>Further from the harbor, on this side, is a high rock formation stretching about half a mile, starting from behind the lighthouse.</t1439> <t1440>At the end of the rock formation, there is a buoy equipped with a bell that only tolls mournfully during significant moments.</t1440> <t1441>There is a local legend that says when a ship is lost, the sailors can hear the bell ringing from afar offshore...</t1441> <t1442>I need to ask the old man walking towards me if this is really true.</t1442>
<t1443>He was an old man unlike any other old man in this world.</t1443> <t1444>He must have been very old because his face was full of wrinkles, and it was rough like tree bark. He told me that he had lived for nearly a hundred years, and that he still lived on a Greenland fishing boat since the Battle of Waterloo.</t1444> <t1445>Suddenly, I became doubtful, because when I asked him about the bell that could be heard from far out at sea, and about the woman in white at the monastery, he only gave vague answers like this:</t1445>
<t1446>— Little girl, actually, I don't really believe in such stories, they're too old...</t1446> <t1447>Please note, I'm not saying it never existed, but I just want to say that it was around even before I was born...</t1447> <t1448>All that you just asked is really fascinating to foreigners, those who love to wander and all...</t1448> <t1449>but it's not something a young lady like you should burden your mind with.</t1449> <t1450>Those travelers from York and from Leeds, those who always like to see what's cheap at the market, might believe in that.</t1450> <t1451>But I don't understand why anyone would waste their effort to tell them such lies - even the newspapers known for being foolish don't do that.</t1451>
<t1452>I thought to myself: "This is truly an old man from whom others can certainly learn many interesting things," and had to divert the conversation to the ancient practice of whale fishing.</t1452> <t1453>But just as I was about to hear the story, the clock suddenly chimed six times, and the old man immediately stood up, his voice strained:</t1453>
<t1454>— Young lady, I think I must go now, my little girl doesn't like having to wait for anyone once she has made tea.</t1454> <t1455>Besides, it takes me a lot of time to get down all the steps.</t1455>
<t1456>The old man dragged his steps home.</t1456> <t1457>I kept watching the elderly figure trying to descend the stone steps as quickly as possible, with the limited ability of someone in their twilight years.</t1457>
<t1458>The stone steps are one of the very distinctive features of this area.</t1458> <t1459>They run from the city up to the church; there are easily a few hundred steps, somewhat spiraling.</t1459> <t1460>In fact, they are not very precarious, as a horse can easily gallop up and down them.</t1460> <t1461>Surely in the past, these steps must have also led to the areas surrounding the monastery...</t1461> <t1462>Perhaps I should go home as well.</t1462> <t1463>Lucy and her mother have gone sightseeing all afternoon.</t1463> <t1464>I don't want to disturb them.</t1464> <t1465>By now, they are probably about to return.</t1465>
<t1466>• August 1</t1466>
<t1467>I've been sitting here with Lucy for about an hour, and we've had a very interesting conversation with our new friend: Old Marin, and the two friends who visit him daily.</t1467> <t1468>Among the three old men, I can clearly name Old Marin as the Saint, because he always wants to be the one who's right, and he always likes to contradict everyone else.</t1468> <t1469>If he can't, he'll make a fuss, as if he's cursing directly at the people he's talking to, and when they get tired and don't want to talk anymore, he thinks they've been convinced by him.</t1469> <t1470>Lucy is wearing a long dress that she really likes.</t1470> <t1471>Since coming to Whitby, her complexion seems to have improved significantly.</t1471> <t1472>I've noticed that whenever we have a chance to sit and chat here, the three old men always try to find a way to get closer to her.</t1472> <t1473>Indeed, Lucy is a very likable girl to the elderly.</t1473>
<t1474>No one could resist her charm.</t1474> <t1475>Even my old friend was subdued and never contradicted her.</t1475> <t1476>I deliberately steered the conversation towards legends, and the old man launched into a long sermon that made my head spin:</t1476>
<t1477>— Girl, I told you, it's all just nonsense: those are silly stories, nothing more, nothing less!</t1477> <t1478>All those fascinating, alluring, enchanting stories are only suitable for senile old women.</t1478> <t1479>All of that is concocted by a few priests and those who lure customers in hotels to manipulate others into doing things they don't want to do.</t1479> <t1480>Every time I think about it, I get infuriated.</t1480> <t1481>Printing it on a pile of scrap paper wasn't enough, they even told each other to engrave all sorts of things on tombstones...</t1481> <t1482>Just look around: all those stones standing proudly there are actually weighed down by the lies that people have inscribed all over them! And under those graves, most are empty, there's no one lying there. Better to find a way to get a pinch of tobacco than to worry about those silly stories!</t1482> <t1483>That's it, it's all just lies, lies in one way or another, nothing but lies?</t1483> <t1484>Oh God?</t1484> <t1485>How interesting it would be to see the unfortunate souls staggering, clutching each other's shoulders, dragging those tombstones to prove that they are living peacefully down there?</t1485>
<t1486>Seeing the satisfied look on the old man's face and the way he glanced around seeking approval from his two old friends, I understood that he wanted to appear as someone outstanding, but that was enough for me to ask him another question:</t1486>
<t1487>— Oh! Old Swales, you're not being serious again! Almost none of the graves in this cemetery are empty, right?</t1487>
<t1488>The old man seemed to be more pretentious:</t1488>
<t1489>— Young lady, I have said so much already, yet you stubbornly keep bringing up all these foolish matters! There are very few graves there that aren't completely empty... that's it... good people are very prone to believing in the blabbering of others.</t1489> <t1490>Lies, it's all lies! Listen carefully, young lady: I don't believe that you came here without knowing anything, even if you are a stranger, and you should look at...</t1490>
<t1491>I couldn't grasp the words the old man just said.</t1491> <t1492>To be honest, I didn't understand even half of the dialects he used, and I knew it would be hard for me to reproduce that subtle dialect, but I still nodded, though I was still doubtful that the old man might have been referring to the monastery.</t1492>
<t1493>The old man continued:</t1493>
<t1494>— So, do you believe that all those stone graves over there are sheltering someone who is resting in peace?</t1494>
<t1495>I replied with a nod.</t1495>
<t1496>— That is also just a lie! There are up to twenty, twenty, and twenty of those beds that are empty, empty like the minds of those who are accustomed to lying!</t1496>
<t1497>The old man turned to seek the approval of his two peers, and then all three burst into laughter.</t1497>
<t1498>— There, dear Lord! How could it be otherwise? Girl, just try looking at that grave over there, the one I'm pointing at... then try reading it! There... just give it a try...</t1498>
<t1499>I walked closer to the grave the old man was pointing at and read: "Edward Spenceland, captain, murdered by pirates off the coast of Cordillere at the age of 30. April. 1854."</t1499>
<t1500>When I returned, old Mr. Swales continued:</t1500>
<t1501>— So who was the one who brought him back to this land to bury him there?</t1501> <t1502>He was murdered all the way in the Cordillera!</t1502> <t1503>How could his body possibly be there?</t1503> <t1504>I can tell you about dozens of people who have lain at the bottom of the sea, in Greenland or over there, said the old man while pointing north, if at least they weren't carried away further by the currents.</t1504> <t1505>Yet their graves are still here, all around you.</t1505> <t1506>From where you sit, with your beautiful eyes, you can read all the deceitful inscriptions carved on each tombstone.</t1506> <t1507>Look, there's Braithwaite Lowrey over there.</t1507> <t1508>I knew his father; he drowned in the shipwreck of the “Life is Beautiful” off the coast of Greenland when he was just twenty... and Andrew Woodhouse too, he also drowned near there in 1777..., and John Paxton, he died a year later off Cape Farewell..., then old John Rawlings, whose grandfather sailed with me, died in the Gulf of Finland at the age of fifty.</t1508> <t1509>Many, many...</t1509> <t1510>Do you believe that when they hear the trumpets of the Last Judgment blaring, all these men will rush to Whitby?</t1510> <t1511>I think so!</t1511> <t1512>I assure you that they will push and shove each other so much that it will seem like a battle on the ice, lasting from dawn until dark, where the warriors have to bandage their wounds under the dim light of the Arctic.</t1512>
<t1513>Surely, that is a common joke in this place, because when he said it, the old man laughed heartily along with his two friends sitting beside him.</t1513>
<t1514>— But, - I asked - surely you were mistaken in thinking that all those poor people, or rather their pitiable souls, necessarily have to present themselves at their graves at the moment of the Last Judgment.</t1514> <t1515>Do you really still think that is something that must happen?</t1515>
<t1516>— That's right, if not, then what are the stone tombs used for, I'm asking you, girl?</t1516>
<t1517>— To please the members of their family, right, old man?</t1517>
<t1518>— To please the families, right old man? - The old man mocked, mimicking my question. - Try telling me, what pleasure is there for the families when they know that the inscriptions on those graves are just lies, and that everyone knows it?</t1518>
<t1519>Then he pointed to a stone lying at our feet, like a slab keeping the bench balanced on the edge of the cliff:</t1519>
<t1520>— Read these lines of lies below.</t1520>
<t1521>From where I was sitting, I could only read the words on the back, but from Lucy's spot, everything was readable.</t1521> <t1522>Seeing me mention it, Lucy bent down to read:</t1522>
<t1523>"In loving memory of George Canon, who died on July 29, 1873, falling from the mountain peak into the sea, in the hope of a glorious resurrection of the flesh."</t1523> <t1524>"This grave was erected by his mother, who suffered an unending sorrow throughout her life for the loss of a beloved son."</t1524> <t1525>"He was the only son, and his mother was a widow."</t1525>
<t1526>— There's really nothing strange here at all, - Lucy said - old Swales.</t1526>
<t1527>My friend commented in a truly serious tone.</t1527>
<t1528>— Don't you find anything strange...</t1528> <t1529>Ha! Ha! Of course not, because you don't know that poor mother, a wicked witch who hated her son bitterly just because he was weak, and the son also hated his mother because she couldn't provide for his life.</t1529> <t1530>He shot himself in the head with an old gun that he used to scare off the young crows.</t1530> <t1531>That day, he didn't use the gun to scare the crows anymore...</t1531> <t1532>And what people said was a fall from the cliffs...</t1532> <t1533>Of course he fell, and the so-called hope of a glorious resurrection of the dead, I often heard that he wanted to go to hell, because his mother, a very devout person, would surely go to heaven, and he didn't want to die in heaven with his mother...</t1533> <t1534>Now you can say that this stone doesn't bear lies!</t1534>
<t1535>I was about to respond when Lucy suddenly stood up and steered the conversation in a different direction:</t1535>
<t1536>— Oh! Why do you keep telling us all these pointless stories?</t1536> <t1537>This is the chair I usually sit on, and I will never give up that habit, but now I will always tell myself that I am sitting on the grave of a suicide!</t1537>
<t1538>— That won't bother you, beautiful girl! And that poor George would surely be very happy to see such a charming girl sitting on his pillow...</t1538> <t1539>No, that won't bother you at all...</t1539> <t1540>Since I was not even twenty years old, I have been sitting here, and since then, I have never felt uncomfortable? Don't think too much about those lying at your feet, or those who aren't lying there at all.</t1540> <t1541>You will have plenty of time to be scared when you see all the graves being taken away one by one and the cemetery left bare like a field with only stubble...</t1541> <t1542>But anyway, it's time, I have to go back now.</t1542> <t1543>Goodbye, ladies?</t1543>
<t1544>The old man trudged away into the distance.</t1544>
<t1545>We sat for a while longer.</t1545> <t1546>The scenery was so beautiful! Lucy told me again about Arthur and their upcoming wedding.</t1546> <t1547>I suddenly felt a pang of sadness; it has been over a month since I last heard from Jonathan.</t1547>
<t1548>• On the same day</t1548>
<t1549>I returned here with a heavy heart.</t1549> <t1550>Still, the mailman hasn't appeared this evening.</t1550> <t1551>I hope nothing troublesome has happened to Jonathan.</t1551> <t1552>The clock has struck nine.</t1552> <t1553>The city lights have been on for a long time, twinkling like falling stars, sometimes solitary, sometimes lighting up in a continuous row along the streets.</t1553> <t1554>To my left, the scenery is completely obscured by the old rooftops rising near the monastery.</t1554> <t1555>The young lambs are still bleating in the fields behind.</t1555> <t1556>And down below, I can clearly hear the slow clopping of a donkey's hooves.</t1556> <t1557>The harbor band is playing a sad waltz.</t1557> <t1558>A little further away, below the harbor, on a slightly hidden small road, a Salvation Army band is gathering.</t1558> <t1559>Suddenly, both bands start playing loud, jarring tunes, neither listening to the other.</t1559> <t1560>However, standing here, I can hear both clearly, but in my heart right now is still the image of Jonathan.</t1560> <t1561>Where are you? Are you still thinking of me? How I wish to leave this place.</t1561>
<t1562>Dr. Seward's Diary</t1562>
<t1563>• June 5</t1563>
<t1564>The case of Renfield is becoming increasingly interesting, making me understand more and more about human nature.</t1564> <t1565>In his personality, the most prominent traits are selfishness, cunning pretense, and stubbornness.</t1565> <t1566>I hope I will understand why he is so obstinate.</t1566> <t1567>It seems to me that he is harboring a very specific intention, but what is that intention?</t1567> <t1568>However, he loves animals very much, though in that affection, expressed in various foolish ways, there is something strangely cruel.</t1568> <t1569>Up to now, his eccentricity has been manifested in the hobby of catching flies.</t1569> <t1570>I find it unnecessary to keep observing this peculiar behavior, as his absurd actions are not few.</t1570> <t1571>One thing that surprises me greatly is that he never gets angry, as I had feared, but after thinking for a moment, he just asked me in a rather serious tone: “Would you agree to give me three days?</t1571> <t1572>Within three days, I will make them disappear.”</t1572> <t1573>Of course, I replied: “Agreed,” then stared at him as if I had never seen him before.</t1573>
<t1574>• June 18</t1574>
<t1575>Now he only thought about the spiders, the very large spiders he had put into a box.</t1575> <t1576>He fed the spiders with the flies he caught.</t1576> <t1577>The number of flies had decreased significantly after being caught by him several times.</t1577> <t1578>He caught the flies by using half of his food ration as bait on the window ledge.</t1578>
<t1579>• July 1</t1579>
<t1580>The number of spiders is increasing along with the number of flies being caught.</t1580><t1581>I angrily made him throw them all away.</t1581><t1582>But seeing his sorrowful face, I felt a pang of sympathy.</t1582><t1583>I told him at least to throw away a portion.</t1583><t1584>He promised to do so.</t1584><t1585>While sitting with him, I suddenly felt a shiver when a huge fly quickly flew into the room; he swiftly caught the creature, then held it between his thumb and index finger, examining it with a very delighted expression.</t1585><t1586>And before I could guess what would happen next, he suddenly popped the fly into his mouth and chewed it voraciously.</t1586><t1587>I did not hesitate to express my disgust, but he nonchalantly replied that flies are delicious, and that the vibrant life of the fly would invigorate him.</t1587><t1588>A thought, or rather a suspicion, flashed through my mind: I needed to know how he intended to deal with the spiders.</t1588><t1589>There must be something quite serious occupying his mind, as he was scribbling furiously into a pocket notebook.</t1589><t1590>The pages were filled with numbers, as if he was doing calculations.</t1590>
<t1591>• July 8</t1591>
<t1592>In a fit of madness, he followed a real method, and that observation gradually became clearer in my mind.</t1592> <t1593>That method was completely clear.</t1593> <t1594>Oh, the workings of the unconscious mind?</t1594> <t1595>Then one must give way to a conscious intellect.</t1595> <t1596>I deliberately avoided meeting my patient for a few days, convinced that he was undergoing a notable change in state. He could catch a sparrow and tame it in a very simple way that I suddenly guessed: the spiders in the box had significantly decreased.</t1596> <t1597>However, the remaining spiders were very plump, as he diligently caught flies every day with a portion of food placed on the windowsill.</t1597>
<t1598>• July 19</t1598>
<t1599>We have made progress in studying the case.</t1599> <t1600>Now Renfield has a whole flock of sparrows, while the swarms of flies and spiders have almost completely disappeared.</t1600> <t1601>Seeing me enter the room, he hurriedly came up and said that he wanted to ask me for a big favor, a very big one; as he spoke, he stroked me like a dog licking its owner.</t1601> <t1602>I asked what exactly he needed, and he ecstatically replied: "I want a cat, a cute little kitten to be my friend.</t1602> <t1603>I will train it and feed it...</t1603> <t1604>Oh! Yes... I will feed it."</t1604>
<t1605>Indeed, I was a bit surprised by this, as I noticed that he seemed to like bigger animals more and more.</t1605>
<t1606>I really cannot accept the fact that the lovely tamed sparrow family has disappeared in the same way that the flies and spiders have; therefore, I replied that I still needed to think about it.</t1606> <t1607>However, before leaving the room, I asked him in a very indifferent tone why he preferred a kitten over a grown cat.</t1607>
<t1608>— Oh! Yes, - He replied cheerfully - a big cat.</t1608> <t1609>I would really like to have a big cat!</t1609> <t1610>If I asked you for a kitten, it was because I was afraid you would refuse me a big cat?</t1610> <t1611>No one would refuse me a small cat, right?</t1611>
<t1612>I shook my head and replied that I thought it was impossible, at least for now, but eventually we would...</t1612> <t1613>His face darkened, and I immediately read a dangerous warning on that face, as his eyes suddenly flashed with cruel glints like those of a murderer.</t1613>
<t1614>There is no doubt anymore, this patient is indeed a violent murderer.</t1614> <t1615>Then I will see where the obsession of the devil will lead him.</t1615>
<t1616>• 10 PM</t1616>
<t1617>When I returned, I saw him sitting dejectedly in a corner of the room.</t1617>
<t1618>As soon as he saw me, he hurriedly knelt down and begged me to bring the cat.</t1618> <t1619>I immediately replied that it was impossible.</t1619> <t1620>Hearing me say that, he angrily returned to his place, clenching his fists as he walked.</t1620> <t1621>I would see him again early the next morning.</t1621>
<t1622>• July 20</t1622>
<t1623>I met Renfield very early, even earlier than when the warden went to wake the patients in the rooms.</t1623> <t1624>He was standing, humming some tune, while his hands were sprinkling sugar grains on the window sill to bait flies.</t1624> <t1625>The task made him visibly happy.</t1625> <t1626>I glanced around for the sparrows, but didn't see any.</t1626> <t1627>Seeing me ask, he didn't bother to turn around and replied that they had all flown away.</t1627> <t1628>I noticed a few tufts of feathers on the ground, and there was a bloodstain on the pillow he slept on.</t1628> <t1629>When leaving, I tried to act as if nothing had happened, but still instructed the gardener to inform me if anything unusual occurred during the day.</t1629>
<t1630>• 11 AM</t1630>
<t1631>It didn't take long before the warden hurriedly ran to inform me that Renfield was very sick, that he had vomited a whole pile of bird feathers, just bird feathers.</t1631> <t1632>"Doctor," the warden told me, "I believe he has eaten his entire flock of birds alive?"</t1632>
<t1633>• 11 PM</t1633>
<t1634>Tonight, I gave Renfield a sleeping pill and then stole his pocket notebook to read.</t1634> <t1635>Indeed, I was not wrong with my assumptions: this murderous patient is truly a very special kind of person.</t1635> <t1636>I have to categorize him as unprecedented and call him an animalistic madman, a lunatic who only wants to survive by consuming living creatures.</t1636> <t1637>His mind is constantly obsessed with the need to eat as many living bodies as he craves.</t1637> <t1638>He has fed countless flies to a spider, raised a bird with many spiders, and then he even wanted a cat to kill the entire flock of birds.</t1638> <t1639>What does he intend to do next?</t1639> <t1640>I really want to see my experiment through to the end.</t1640> <t1641>But to do so, there must be a sufficient reason.</t1641> <t1642>People will spit in my face if I talk about dissecting this issue, but in any case, I cannot avoid the current reality.</t1642> <t1643>Why not advance science in a more difficult yet vital issue like understanding the brain, the mechanism of human reasoning? If I could understand the mystery of the brain, if I could find the key to unlock the imagination of this unique mental patient, I would surely make a significant leap in my field, and this would allow me to compare myself with the physiologist Burdon Sanderson or the anatomist Ferrier.</t1643>
<t1644>Just one valid reason is enough!</t1644> <t1645>But I don't need to think too much about it, because the temptation is also very simple, a sufficient reason can make me think of a state of balance from my side, because by nature, am I not someone with that special kind of mind?</t1645>
<t1646>Indeed, the patient had his own correct way of reasoning! Yes, madmen always have correct reasoning when they pursue their own ideas.</t1646> <t1647>I wonder how he evaluated a human being in terms of how many living creatures, or did he evaluate a human life as equivalent to just one living creature?</t1647> <t1648>He had concluded his calculations very precisely, and today, he started on new calculations again.</t1648> <t1649>Who among us does not start a day with new calculations?</t1649> <t1650>As for myself, it seems as if just yesterday, my life had truly sunk along with my youthful aspirations, and I also feel that my life began from zero.</t1650> <t1651>It seems as though God is about to call me up there and close the big ledger that clearly records the balance of my gains and losses.</t1651> <t1652>Oh! Lucy, Lucy! I cannot blame you for that, nor can I blame the friend who was fortunate enough to share happiness with you.</t1652> <t1653>But I should not expect much from an existence without hope, an existence where only work remains the sole important thing to me.</t1653> <t1654>Yes, work, only work!</t1654>
<t1655>As long as I can find a compelling reason like the argument of that patient and then, if that reason is strong enough to drive me into work, I will surely find some form of happiness.</t1655>
<t1656>Mina Murray's Diary</t1656>
<t1657>• July 26</t1657>
<t1658>The more time passes, the more anxious I feel, and writing in my diary somewhat eases my mind; it's like confiding in myself.</t1658><t1659>Moreover, writing in shorthand gives me a different feeling compared to regular writing.</t1659><t1660>I feel worried for Lucy as well as for Jonathan.</t1660><t1661>It's been a long time since I last heard from him, but yesterday, Mr. Hawkins, who is always very kind, sent me a letter he received from Jonathan.</t1661><t1662>The letter contained only a few short lines informing about his return from Dracula's castle. This is not like Jonathan at all? I don't understand what could have happened... why do I long for peace of mind so much! As for Lucy, although she seems much healthier, lately, she has been experiencing sleepwalking, also known as somnambulism as the doctors call it.</t1662><t1663>Her mother told me about it, and we decided that from now on, I will lock the door tightly every night.</t1663><t1664>Mrs. Westenra always imagines that sleepwalkers often climb onto the roof, walk to the edge of the most precarious walls, and then wake up and fall to the ground with a desperate, tragic scream that can be heard everywhere.</t1664><t1665>The poor mother has trembled many times at the thought of such a tragedy happening to her Lucy.</t1665><t1666>She told me that in the past, her husband, Lucy's father, also suffered from similar conditions: he would often wake up in the middle of the night, get dressed, and wander out of the house if no one stopped him.</t1666><t1667>Lucy is supposed to get married this fall; she has already prepared her wedding dress, house, and a bunch of clothes to take along.</t1667><t1668>Sir Holmwood - the honorable Arthur Holmwood, son of Lord Godalming and Lucy's fiancé, will surely come here soon; he will come as soon as he can leave the city, as his father is ill.</t1668><t1669>Lucy quietly counts each day, each hour...</t1669><t1670>She says she really wants to sit with him on the stone bench in the cemetery and show him the magnificent scenery of Whitby.</t1670><t1671>I think her anxious waiting will negatively affect her health.</t1671><t1672>I hope she will be satisfied when she meets her fiancé here.</t1672>
<t1673>• July 27</t1673>
<t1674>There is still no further news about Jonathan.</t1674> <t1675>Why doesn't he write to me, even just a word?</t1675> <t1676>Lately, Lucy has been getting up more often at night, and every time I wake up, I see her pacing back and forth in the room.</t1676> <t1677>Fortunately, the weather is still warm, otherwise she would surely catch a cold.</t1677> <t1678>As for me, my anxiety keeps growing, and the restless, almost sleepless nights have made me very tense.</t1678> <t1679>On the contrary, thank God, Lucy is still healthy.</t1679> <t1680>Holmwood just received a telegram and had to return to Ring immediately; Lord Godalming's health is becoming very serious.</t1680> <t1681>Of course, Lucy is very upset because she cannot meet her fiancé as she thought she would, sometimes she even shows irritation and frustration, but her health is not affected at all, and her cheeks are sometimes even rosier than usual.</t1681>
<t1682>May this last forever.</t1682>
<t1683>• August 3</t1683>
<t1684>Another week has passed, and I still haven't received any news from Jonathan! This time, he didn't even write to Mr. Hawkins.</t1684> <t1685>Oh! I hope he's not sick.</t1685> <t1686>But if that were the case, he would surely have sent a letter.</t1686> <t1687>Reading his last letter, I felt something was off.</t1687> <t1688>I no longer recognize him in the things he says in the letter.</t1688>
<t1689>This time, Lucy is no longer sleepwalking as much as before, but now there is something really strange about her that makes me somewhat worried: even when she is sleeping, I still have the feeling that she is watching me.</t1689> <t1690>She tried to open the door several times, but when she realized that it was locked, she started looking for the key all over the room.</t1690>
<t1691>• August 6</t1691>
<t1692>Another three days passed, and Jonathan was still nowhere to be found.</t1692>
<t1693>The waiting for me now has become a truly terrible anxiety.</t1693><t1694>At this moment, I just need to know if I can write to someone or find someone, that would be enough to ease my mind.</t1694><t1695>But among Jonathan's friends, not a single one has received any word from him.</t1695><t1696>I can only pray to God to grant me the patience to wait longer.</t1696><t1697>Lucy is truly more irritable than ever, although she is still healthy.</t1697><t1698>Tonight there is a storm, the fishermen say that a storm is coming.</t1698><t1699>Just by looking at the sky and the earth, I can also recognize the signs of the storm.</t1699><t1700>Today's sky is gray; as I sit writing these lines, the sun has been completely obscured by the clouds heavily laden with moisture rolling in from the headland.</t1700><t1701>Everything is a uniform gray, completely gray, except for the grass which still has a hint of dark green.</t1701><t1702>The sunlight now only casts weak rays through the gray clouds down to the equally gray sea, where occasionally long sand dunes jut out like dark fingers.</t1702><t1703>The white-capped waves continuously crash against the shore, but the noise of the sea seems to be muffled by the fog being driven inland all at once.</t1703><t1704>It all creates a vast feeling.</t1704><t1705>The clouds pile up on each other like giant rocks in the endless roaring space of the sea.</t1705><t1706>Here and there on the beach, one can catch sight of vague human figures curled up in the fog, making anyone who sees them think they are seeing "walking trees."</t1706><t1707>The fishing boats are hurrying back to the harbor to avoid the sea's calamity...</t1707><t1708>There he is, old Swales, it seems the old man wants to come and talk to me.</t1708>
<t1709>The poor old man had changed a lot in the past few days, which made me quite surprised.</t1709> <t1710>As soon as he sat down next to me, he immediately spoke in a very soft voice:</t1710>
<t1711>— I want to ask you something, young lady..</t1711><t1712>.</t1712>
<t1713>Seeing that he seemed confused, I hurriedly took his wrinkled old hand and told him to go ahead and speak.</t1713> <t1714>The old man explained, his hand still in mine:</t1714>
<t1715>— My daughter, I hope I won't shock you when I talk to you about all things related to death...</t1715> <t1716>Honestly, I have gone beyond my own thoughts and I want you to remember everything when I'm no longer here...</t1716> <t1717>We, the old folks, often tend to ramble.</t1717> <t1718>We are all close to the grave, and no one wants to think too much about death or to fear that fate!</t1718> <t1719>As for me, I have decided to talk a bit about death to somewhat reassure myself.</t1719> <t1720>However, my daughter, God as my witness, I am not afraid of death, not at all.</t1720> <t1721>It's just that, if only it wouldn't aim at me so soon, because I still want to live a little longer.</t1721> <t1722>But my time is surely coming to an end, because when one reaches a hundred years old, there's not much hope left.</t1722> <t1723>As you can see, I can't hold back these blasphemous words... yes, the Grim Reaper will soon sound the trumpet calling me back, but don't be sad, my daughter? - The old man said while wiping my tears.</t1723> <t1724>- Even if He calls tonight, I am ready to answer.</t1724> <t1725>Because after all, living means waiting for something different from what we have, something different from what we are doing.</t1725> <t1726>Death is the only thing we can count on in that situation.</t1726> <t1727>Yes, my little daughter, it can come and come very quickly, in fact, I am very content!</t1727> <t1728>Perhaps the wind from the sea has carried away all those ill-fated ships as well as the lonely, miserable lives...</t1728> <t1729>See? See, my child. - The old man suddenly exclaimed. - In that wind, in that mist, there seems to be something lurking like death?</t1729> <t1730>It is hovering in the cold wind!</t1730> <t1731>It's coming, it's coming, I know it...</t1731> <t1732>Oh God! Make me answer that call without regret!</t1732>
<t1733>The old man reverently raised his hands to the sky and then respectfully took off his hat.</t1733> <t1734>His lips moved continuously as if he were praying.</t1734> <t1735>After a moment of silence, the old man slowly stood up, tightly grasped both of my hands, blessed me, and then quietly left with his familiar weary gait.</t1735> <t1736>I stood there like a stone statue, my mind completely blank.</t1736> <t1737>The appearance of the coast guard jolted me back to reality.</t1737> <t1738>He had a long telescope tucked under his arm.</t1738> <t1739>Out of habit, he stopped to exchange a few nonsensical words with me, while his eyes remained fixed on the sea, where a ship seemed to be in trouble.</t1739>
<t1740>— It is clearly a foreign ship.</t1740> <t1741>- The coast guard said.</t1741> <t1742>- It must be a Russian ship.</t1742> <t1743>But why is it maneuvering so strangely? It's like it doesn't know what it wants? like... like it feels a storm coming but still can't decide whether to turn north or head into this port.</t1743> <t1744>Just try looking at it!</t1744> <t1745>There's definitely no one steering it, right?</t1745> <t1746>It changes direction every time a gust of wind hits! Trust me, by this time tomorrow, we'll definitely be hearing about this bizarre ship!</t1746>
<t1747>CHAPTER 7</t1747>
<t1748>Articles cut from the "Dailygraph" newspaper pasted in Mina Murray's diary</t1748>
<t1749>(Article by one of our correspondents)</t1749>
<t1750>• Whitby, August 8</t1750>
<t1751>The most terrible and unexpected storm has just made landfall, causing unprecedented severe consequences.</t1751><t1752>Before that, the weather was quite stifling but not unusual for a month like August.</t1752><t1753>On Sunday afternoon, the weather was still very beautiful, but yesterday many villagers had left for other places or into the Mulgrave woods, making the atmosphere in Whitby and the surrounding areas suddenly become bustling.</t1753><t1754>The weather remained normal, if not splendid, until late afternoon, but a few old men - who had the daily habit of climbing up to the cemetery to chat and watch the sea, as this cemetery was located on a towering cliff - were startled when they noticed "cat-tail" shaped clouds drifting in the northwest.</t1754><t1755>At that time, the wind was only at level two on the anemometer.</t1755><t1756>The coast guard had to urgently make a report about the unusual weather phenomenon; and an old fisherman, who had more than fifty years of experience in observing marine weather signs, announced that a terrible storm was about to fiercely attack the mainland.</t1756><t1757>But the twilight still had enough strength to tint the clouds drifting towards the horizon with a rosy hue, creating a magnificent picture as a reward for those still lingering in the ancient cemetery.</t1757><t1758>The setting sun gradually turned the headland into a dark shade like a sword slashing across the sky.</t1758><t1759>The sunset mixed with the clouds in various shades of pink, purple, blue, and especially shimmering gold, creating all sorts of bizarre shapes.</t1759><t1760>The most romantic artists could use this as inspiration for their nature paintings: they might name a piece, for example, Prelude to the Death Storm.</t1760><t1761>No ship owner dared to boldly decide to let their vessel leave the port before the storm subsided.</t1761><t1762>At dusk, the sea breeze completely died down, the space suddenly became eerily quiet, and the stifling, oppressive atmosphere typical before storms began to spread into every corner, making it unbearable for sensitive people.</t1762><t1763>The sea was as dark as ink.</t1763><t1764>The only thing that could still be clearly recognized was a foreign sailing boat.</t1764><t1765>The boat had all its sails up, seemingly drifting westward.</t1765><t1766>The carelessness and clumsiness of the officers on the ship were so evident that the crowd standing on the port was buzzing with discussion, trying to make them realize that there was a looming danger above them, and that they should lower all the sails.</t1766>
<t1767>A little before ten o'clock, the oppressive atmosphere started to become suffocatingly stifling, and everything was so profoundly silent that one could clearly hear the bleating of a sheep or the barking of a house dog coming from a great distance.</t1767> <t1768>But that silence could not last forever.</t1768> <t1769>Right after the clock struck twelve, a strange and ominous rumbling sound was heard coming from the offshore, getting closer and closer, at the same time a faint thunder rumbled threateningly behind the deadly clouds.</t1769>
<t1770>That thunderous roar was indeed an immediate sign heralding an unexpected disaster rumbling in right after.</t1770> <t1771>It was truly incomprehensible: within just a few minutes, the gentle nature suddenly turned its face, revealing its fierce essence.</t1771> <t1772>The calm sea transformed itself into a monstrous demon with gigantic waves crashing against each other as if wanting to level and destroy everything.</t1772> <t1773>The frenzied sea roared, demanding to swallow the shores and the steep cliffs.</t1773> <t1774>The winds at this moment also roared like thunderclaps, with a terrifying force that made it difficult for even the sturdiest men to stand firm on their path.</t1774>
<t1775>The people lingering on the harbor had to quickly find shelter, as the danger was increasing by the minute.</t1775> <t1776>As if to prove its boundless ferocity, the sea was showing off with enormous waves crashing deep inland.</t1776> <t1777>On the shore, those with a weak heart could easily imagine these white mist clouds as countless bizarre ghosts, hovering and dancing on the beach.</t1777> <t1778>Anyone with a bit of imagination could immediately think of the image of the sea trying to drag all the small, fragile creatures on the shore down to its dark abyss with its deadly white hands.</t1778> <t1779>Yes, those white clouds could instantly envelop you if you were unfortunate enough to stand there.</t1779> <t1780>Occasionally, the sea ghosts would appear and disappear as sudden blinding flashes of lightning zigzagged across the sea, followed by thunderclaps that seemed to tear the sky apart.</t1780>
<t1781>The continuous flashes of lightning made the sea seem even more majestic.</t1781> <t1782>Each time the waves rose, the sea surface suddenly elevated with undulating water mountains.</t1782> <t1783>Scattered here and there on the sea were a fishing boat and a small boat, looking like tattered rags not knowing where to go or how to escape.</t1783> <t1784>Occasionally, atop the waves appeared white seabirds struggling against the stormy winds.</t1784> <t1785>Standing tall on the eastern cliff was a lighthouse waiting to be used for the first time.</t1785> <t1786>The port's people were trying every possible way to make the light shine.</t1786> <t1787>And once or twice, this new light had proven effective - any ship or boat that saw the sweeping light from this lighthouse could find its way into the port without fear of crashing into the rocks.</t1787> <t1788>Each time a boat or a fishing vessel made it into the port, the crowd would cheer loudly from their hiding places.</t1788> <t1789>Of course, their joyous shouts were always drowned out by the roaring sea and stormy winds.</t1789>
<t1790>Under the flickering lights, people could still see the sailboat raising all its sails offshore; it seemed to be the same boat they had seen at dusk.</t1790><t1791>At this moment, the wind had shifted to the east, and the people hiding on the shore began to feel a shiver as they realized the terrible danger looming over the lone boat.</t1791><t1792>Between the boat and the harbor was a jagged line of rocks stretching out, which had shattered countless ships before sending them to the depths.</t1792><t1793>Once the east wind picked up, the boat would be like a grain of sand in that vast sea, unable to enter the harbor.</t1793><t1794>Although it was high tide, the savage waves rose so high that when they receded, only the bare seabed was visible.</t1794><t1795>Yet the boat, with its sails taut, sped forward; as an experienced fisherman would say, the boat was "clearly heading somewhere down to hell."</t1795><t1796>Driven ashore, the dense fog clouds appeared again like walls separating the world, allowing the fishermen and those on shore to perceive everything only through their ears.</t1796><t1797>All that remained were the howling of the storm, the deafening roar of thunder, and the furious crashing of the waves.</t1797><t1798>The lights now focused on a fixed point at the harbor entrance, precisely towards the east of the breakwater, where a collision was expected.</t1798><t1799>Those lingering on the shore held their breath in anticipation.</t1799><t1800>But the sea wind suddenly shifted to the northeast, immediately dispersing the fog.</t1800><t1801>And something almost unbelievable happened: the sailboat rose above the massive waves, sped between the two breakwaters, and dashed straight into a shelter within the harbor.</t1801>
<t1802>The beam of light immediately swept across the boat.</t1802> <t1803>The people on the shore were stunned when they suddenly noticed a dead body standing close to the rudder at the stern, its head drooping and swaying continuously from side to side with the rocking of the boat.</t1803> <t1804>There was no other person on it.</t1804> <t1805>The crowd gasped in horror, suspecting that the sailboat had sailed into the harbor by some magical force: was it the hand of the dead body gripping the rudder?</t1805> <t1806>However, the scene passed too quickly to describe in detail.</t1806> <t1807>The boat continued to speed towards the shore and crashed into a pile of sand and gravel accumulated by the tide and sea storms at the southeast corner of the harbor, adjacent to the end of the cliff, where there was another breakwater that the locals called Tate Hill.</t1807>
<t1808>The ship experienced a significant shock when it collided with a pile of gravel and sand.</t1808> <t1809>The masts and ropes were torn apart.</t1809> <t1810>And there was another surprise: just as the bow of the ship hit the shore, a large dog suddenly burst from below deck onto the deck and then leapt onto the shore as if urged by the recent collision.</t1810> <t1811>The dog ran headlong towards the edge of the precarious cliff - so precarious that some gravestones were jutting out - and then disappeared into the darkness beyond the lights.</t1811>
<t1812>The incident happened by chance; at that time, there was no one on Tate Hill. The residents of the surrounding houses were either fast asleep or had temporarily moved to the high mounds by the harbor.</t1812> <t1813>The coast guard rushed to the scene and was the first to jump onto the boat.</t1813> <t1814>The lighthouse operators, after a while of not detecting any further hazards on the way to the harbor, directed all the lights towards the stranded boat and kept the lights fixed there.</t1814> <t1815>On the boat, the coast guard hurriedly ran to the end to check.</t1815> <t1816>People could clearly see him bending down to look at the place where the rudder was, then immediately backing out as if he had just experienced an unbearable shock.</t1816> <t1817>This further stimulated the curiosity of those watching his presence on the boat.</t1817> <t1818>Many people rushed towards the boat to witness firsthand what had happened.</t1818> <t1819>I was also among the first to run from the cliff down to the breakwater.</t1819> <t1820>However, some people had managed to arrive before me.</t1820> <t1821>The coast guard, along with the police, had to work hard to prevent the curious from climbing onto the boat.</t1821> <t1822>However, as a reporter for the Dailygraph, I was allowed to board the deck.</t1822> <t1823>Along with a few others, I witnessed firsthand the corpse leaning against the rudder.</t1823>
<t1824>Surprise, then fear were clearly visible on the typically honest face of the coast guard.</t1824> <t1825>The dead man's hands were still gripping tightly onto a spoke of the ship's wheel.</t1825> <t1826>Between those palms and the wooden spoke was a small cross, which no one knew who had placed there or when.</t1826> <t1827>The string attached to the cross was wrapped around both hands and also around the spoke of the wheel, along with several other strings tied messily around it.</t1827> <t1828>Surely, this poor man had been standing like that for quite some time, because in the raging storm, the wheel had freely turned this way and that, causing the binding strings to chafe and wear down to the bone on his wrists.</t1828> <t1829>A detailed report was made about this incident, and the physician, Dr. J. M. Caffyn (house number 33, East Elliot Square), who arrived right after me, declared after examination that the unfortunate man had been dead for two days.</t1829> <t1830>In the man's trouser pocket, they found a bottle sealed very carefully, containing a small roll of paper, which was later identified as the ship's logbook pages.</t1830> <t1831>According to the coast guard, the man had surely tied his own hands and used his teeth to tighten the knots before he died.</t1831>
<t1832>Now that the storm has passed, everyone has returned to their homes, and the sun's first rays are beginning to shine over the Yorkshire valleys.</t1832> <t1833>I will meet you again in the next issue with more details about this type of stranded boat.</t1833>
<t1834>• Whitby, August 9</t1834>
<t1835>The discoveries following the unexpected appearance of the strange ship amidst last night's storm were even more astonishing than the event itself.</t1835> <t1836>It is now known that the ship was a Russian vessel from the region of Varna, and its name was Demeter. The first strange thing discovered was that the ship was carrying a cargo of seemingly worthless items - crates filled with soil sent to the address of a solicitor in Whitby, Mr. S.F. Billington, 7 Crescent Street.</t1836> <t1837>This morning, the person named Billington arrived at the port to receive the shipment in accordance with the proper paperwork procedures.</t1837>
<t1838>As for their part, the Russian consulate officially reclaimed the ship after completing all diplomatic procedures and signing the ship receipt report. In Whitby today, people are only talking about the strange ship event. Many also mentioned the large dog that jumped ashore as soon as the ship's bow struck the gravel and sand.</t1838> <t1839>After that, the animal was nowhere to be found.</t1839> <t1840>Perhaps out of sheer terror from the storm, the animal hid somewhere in the dense, overgrown wastelands.</t1840> <t1841>Some people expressed doubts about this predicted scenario and also saw it as a real danger, as they said the animal seemed very ferocious.</t1841> <t1842>Early this morning, someone discovered a very large dog lying dead on its back on the road near the harbor.</t1842> <t1843>The owner of the dog, a drug dealer, found the poor animal lying dead right in front of his house.</t1843> <t1844>It was clear that the animal had been killed by a very strong and fierce opponent, as there was a real tear on its neck, and its belly had been ripped open by the fangs and claws of a wild beast.</t1844>
<t1845>• A few hours later</t1845>
<t1846>The inspector from the Ministry of Commerce allowed me to open the logbook that had been kept sealed for three days in accordance with maritime law, but the contents of the logbook were not interesting except for details related to the loss of lives.</t1846> <t1847>To be honest, I have never known a stranger story than this.</t1847> <t1848>The authorities have agreed to let me record it here at the request of the readers.</t1848> <t1849>I feel that when drafting these log entries, the captain of the ship might have been suffering from some kind of madness just before setting sail, and his condition seemed to worsen throughout the journey.</t1849> <t1850>You should know that I have transcribed the contents of the logbook according to the translation of a Russian consulate secretary:</t1850>
<t1851>"The logbook of the voyage from Varna to Whitby of the ship Demeter."</t1851>
<t1852>Until today, July 18th, many strange and unusual events have occurred, prompting me to keep a diary until the ship reaches Whitby.</t1852>
<t1853>On July 6, we finished loading the sand and containers full of humus onto the ship.</t1853> <t1854>At noon, we set sail.</t1854> <t1855>The east wind blew cool and refreshing.</t1855> <t1856>On the ship, there were five sailors, two non-commissioned officers, a cook, and me, the captain.</t1856>
<t1857>On July 11, at dawn, our ship entered the Bosphorus port.</t1857> <t1858>Turkish customs officers boarded to inspect the ship.</t1858> <t1859>Money for matches and tobacco.</t1859> <t1860>Everything was very precise.</t1860> <t1861>We continued our journey at four in the afternoon.</t1861>
<t1862>July 12, passed through the Dardanelles.</t1862> <t1863>Again the customs officers and the money for matches and tobacco.</t1863> <t1864>Everything was done very quickly.</t1864> <t1865>They wanted to see us leave sooner.</t1865> <t1866>In the evening, our ship passed through the archipelago.</t1866>
<t1867>On July 13th, we arrived at Cape Natapan.</t1867> <t1868>The crew seemed unhappy, as if they were afraid of something but no one dared to speak up.</t1868>
<t1869>On July 14, I began to feel quite anxious about their issue.</t1869> <t1870>I knew I could rely on these people, as I often went to sea with them.</t1870> <t1871>Like me, my deputy did not understand what was happening.</t1871> <t1872>The men were just talking and gesturing that something was happening on the ship.</t1872> <t1873>He suddenly got furious and started hitting a sailor repeatedly.</t1873> <t1874>Except for this incident, there were no other issues.</t1874>
<t1875>On the morning of the 16th, the deputy came to inform me that one of them, named Petrofsky, had disappeared.</t1875> <t1876>The matter is inexplicable. At 8 PM last night, he was still on duty, then handed over the shift to Abrámoff, but after that, no one saw him go to sleep.</t1876> <t1877>The remaining people began to show more anxiety than ever, it seemed they had suspected such a disappearance for a few days already, but when asked, they still consistently responded with the familiar phrase that something was happening on the ship.</t1877> <t1878>Finally, my deputy got furious again: he suspected that they were planning a mutiny.</t1878>
<t1879>On July 17th, yesterday, sailor Olgaren came to me and fearfully confided that he was thinking about a strange man on the ship.</t1879><t1880>He said that during his watch, he had stood hiding behind the ship's bow to avoid the rising storm, and had accidentally seen a tall but gaunt man, unlike anyone among us, appear on the deck, walk quickly towards the bow, and suddenly disappear.</t1880><t1881>He followed, but when he reached the bow, he saw no one there; all the deck doors were still locked.</t1881><t1882>Standing in front of me, the sailor's fear had not lessened at all; I feared that his panic would spread to the entire crew.</t1882><t1883>To reassure them, today I had to search every nook and cranny of the ship.</t1883>
<t1884>I gathered everyone together and told them that since they believed there was a stranger on board, we would search every place from the bow to the stern of the ship.</t1884> <t1885>The first mate showed displeasure with my idea, he said that conceding to such foolish suggestions was laughable and that it would only encourage the sailors to cause more trouble.</t1885> <t1886>Leaving him in the cockpit, I, along with the others, took lamps and searched the entire ship.</t1886> <t1887>We searched very thoroughly in the corners where the man could be hiding.</t1887> <t1888>Our search ended, everyone breathed a sigh of relief and could happily return to their duties.</t1888> <t1889>The first mate tilted his head and looked at me but said nothing.</t1889>
<t1890>July 22</t1890>
<t1891>The storm has been raging for the past three days, and all of us have been struggling with the sails.</t1891> <t1892>There is no time left to be afraid; sometimes they don't even think about it.</t1892> <t1893>However, the first mate still hasn't shaken off his irritation.</t1893> <t1894>Commendable are those who are dedicated to their work amidst the waves.</t1894> <t1895>The ship has passed Gibraltar and is entering the Strait of Gibraltar.</t1895> <t1896>Everything is fine.</t1896>
<t1897>July 24</t1897>
<t1898>Clearly, the curse still haunts us.</t1898> <t1899>A person on the ship has disappeared, and last night, while the storm was still raging, on the way into the Bay of Biscay, we found another person missing.</t1899> <t1900>Just like before, he had just finished his shift, but no one saw him return to sleep.</t1900> <t1901>Panic once again enveloped the entire ship; the sailors had to agree to stand watch in pairs, simply because they were afraid to be alone.</t1901> <t1902>Of course, my first mate was furious again.</t1902> <t1903>I feared an outburst, either from him or from the crew.</t1903>
<t1904>July 28</t1904>
<t1905>For the past four days, the ship has been like entering a real hell, still stormy winds, no one can sleep anymore, everyone is exhausted.</t1905> <t1906>There is no longer a single person who can stand watch.</t1906> <t1907>The first mate was asked to take over the watch so that the remaining people could rest and catch a bit of sleep.</t1907>
<t1908>The wind had weakened somewhat, but the waves were still very fierce.</t1908> <t1909>However, we felt less tossed about, and the ship gradually regained its balance.</t1909>
<t1910>July 29</t1910>
<t1911>Another tragedy.</t1911> <t1912>Tonight, there was only one person on watch.</t1912> <t1913>In the morning, another sailor came to replace him, but when he got on deck, he saw no one except a man by the helm.</t1913> <t1914>Hearing the terrified cry of the sailor, we all rushed up to the deck, but all our searches were in vain.</t1914> <t1915>The ship had lost another sailor.</t1915> <t1916>Everyone was in panic again.</t1916> <t1917>The first mate and I decided to arm ourselves and wait.</t1917>
<t1918>July 30</t1918>
<t1919>It is certainly the last night.</t1919> <t1920>Luckily, we are nearing England.</t1920> <t1921>The weather is beautiful, and all the sails on the ship are hoisted.</t1921> <t1922>I had to go to sleep, a deep sleep, but the first mate unexpectedly woke me up and informed me that two sailors on duty had disappeared, including the helmsman.</t1922> <t1923>So there are only four of us left on the ship - me, the first mate, and two others.</t1923>
<t1924>August 1, 1924</t1924>
<t1925>Two days of dense fog and not a single sail in sight.</t1925> <t1926>I hope that when we reach the English Channel, we can call for help.</t1926> <t1927>When there was no way to control the sails (I didn't dare lower them for fear of not being able to raise them again), we began to be threatened by the winds blowing from behind.</t1927> <t1928>Indeed, we were being driven towards a terrible fate.</t1928>
<t1929>The first mate at this moment was even more discouraged than the other two sailors.</t1929> <t1930>These two men didn't even dare to think to be afraid anymore; they continued to patiently work and await the worst.</t1930> <t1931>They were Russian, while the first mate was Romanian.</t1931>
<t1932>August 2, midnight</t1932>
<t1933>Just a few minutes after falling asleep, I was suddenly startled awake by a heartrending cry that came through the window.</t1933> <t1934>I rushed up to the deck and met the first mate there.</t1934> <t1935>He said he also heard the cry, but before running here immediately, he had not seen the sailor on duty anywhere.</t1935> <t1936>Another life lost.</t1936> <t1937>God, please protect us! According to the first mate, we are in the North Sea, and only God can guide us through the layers of fog, but it seems God has abandoned us?</t1937>
<t1938>August 3, 1938</t1938>
<t1939>At midnight, I intended to sneak over to the sailor who was steering, but to my astonishment, I couldn't see anyone there!</t1939><t1940>I shouted for the first mate, and he appeared immediately.</t1940><t1941>His wide, frantic eyes clearly showed real panic, and I feared he might lose his mind. He came close to me and whispered in my ear as if afraid the wind might hear: "I know for sure what's happening here.</t1941><t1942>Last night I saw it: a tall, skinny figure with a pale face.</t1942><t1943>It was standing at the bow, facing out to sea.</t1943><t1944>I sneaked up behind it and aimed a slash at its neck, but the blade didn't hit anything; I felt as if I had just slashed through air."</t1944><t1945>- As he spoke, he pulled a knife from his pocket and slashed violently as if trying to cut through the air. - "But if I stay here, I'll definitely catch it.</t1945><t1946>In the ship's hold, or in some barrel.</t1946><t1947>I'll open each barrel one by one; it can't escape."</t1947><t1948>And you, please take the helm."</t1948><t1949>After saying that, he winked, raised a finger to his lips to signal me to be quiet, and then went below deck.</t1949><t1950>The sea wind was blowing stronger and stronger, and of course, I couldn't leave the helm.</t1950><t1951>A moment later, I saw the first mate returning to the deck with a toolbox and a lantern, then disappearing into the forward hatch.</t1951><t1952>He's gone mad; reasoning with him now would be useless.</t1952><t1953>So I had to sit here alone to watch the helm and take the opportunity to write these lines.</t1953><t1954>All I can do now is trust in God and wait for the fog to gradually lift.</t1954><t1955>If I can reach a port, I'll lower all the sails and signal for help.</t1955>
<t1956>Oh Lord! I am very afraid that everything will end right now.</t1956> <t1957>Just when I started to hope that the first mate would calm down (because I had heard the sounds of his knife slashing in the hold), there was a sudden horrifying scream that echoed through the deck door, followed by the sight of the first mate being thrown up onto the deck like a banana tree.</t1957>
<t1958>At this moment, he looked no different from a truly insane person: his eyes were bewildered, his face clearly showing fear.</t1958> <t1959>"Help me! Help me!" He screamed while fearfully looking around the wall of fog.</t1959> <t1960>Then his fear was replaced by a feeling of despair, and he spoke to me in a rather determined voice: "You should also find a way to manage before it's too late, captain.</t1960> <t1961>It's down there.</t1961> <t1962>Now I know everything very clearly.</t1962> <t1963>Only the sea can help me escape the claws of this monster!" Before I could say a word or make any reflexive movement, I saw him jump into the sea.</t1963> <t1964>I believe that now I also understand the secret clearly.</t1964> <t1965>Surely that unfortunate person had gone mad, driving everyone off the ship one by one, and now he himself wanted to follow them into the sea.</t1965> <t1966>May God help me! How will I explain these terrible nightmares when the ship docks?</t1966> <t1967>When the ship docks! Or will I never be able to reach the port again?</t1967>
<t1968>August 4</t1968>
<t1969>The sunlight could not dispel the thick fog.</t1969> <t1970>If I were not a sailor, I might not have known that the sun had risen.</t1970> <t1971>I did not dare go below deck, nor did I dare leave the helm to go elsewhere, so I had to sit there anxiously all night.</t1971> <t1972>And in the pitch darkness, I realized the situation - or rather, I realized it! It was it! So that's how it was.</t1972> <t1973>Lord, please forgive me? My mate did the right thing by jumping into the sea.</t1973> <t1974>I want to die like a man, no one can criticize such a death for a sailor.</t1974> <t1975>But as for me, I cannot abandon the ship, because I am the captain.</t1975> <t1976>However, I will find a way to thwart all the schemes of this demon: when I feel exhausted, I will tie my hands to the wheel and also tie to it that which... that which it dares not touch, and regardless of whether the weather is favorable or not, I will still find every way to escape and preserve the honor of a captain! I feel myself growing weaker, soon the night will fall again.</t1976> <t1977>If I delay, I might not have time to act...</t1977> <t1978>If not, at least people will know that I was not an irresponsible person.</t1978> <t1979>Lord, Holy Virgin Mary, and all the merciful saints, please come to save an innocent, pitiable, and well-intentioned soul!...</t1979><t1980>»</t1980>
<t1981>After I finished listening to all the diary entries, the inspector concluded that this was a serious case with an unknown perpetrator.</t1981> <t1982>Indeed, there was no reliable evidence on the ship, and no one could say whether the culprit behind the deaths was human or not.</t1982> <t1983>The fishermen in Whitby all agreed to honor the captain as a hero and organized a funeral for him with the most solemn ceremonies in the area.</t1983> <t1984>His body will be buried at a place on the cliff overlooking the harbor.</t1984>
<t1985>People still have not found any trace of that big dog; public opinion in the area as well as the small town of Whitby has expressed regret about this.</t1985> <t1986>So, tomorrow we will attend the captain's funeral.</t1986> <t1987>And this will be the conclusion of the story "The Mystery of the Sea," which has been embellished with countless details.</t1987>

<t1989>• August 6</t1989>
<t1990>Lucy rummaged around all night, and so did I, tossing and turning without being able to fall asleep.</t1990> <t1991>The storm was terrifying; hearing the wind whistling through the chimney, I thought it was the sound of cannons.</t1991> <t1992>Strangely enough, even though she wasn't awake, Lucy got up twice to put on her clothes.</t1992> <t1993>Fortunately, each time I heard the noise and quickly ran over to intervene, guiding her back to bed.</t1993> <t1994>I really can't understand people who sleepwalk, because when I ran over to stop Lucy's movements, I saw her immediately abandon the intention she had formed just moments before—if it can even be called an intention in this case—and return to her normal routine.</t1994>
<t1995>The two of us woke up very early and curiously invited each other to the port to see what had happened last night.</t1995> <t1996>There was almost no one there, even though the sun had risen and the weather had somewhat cooled down again.</t1996> <t1997>The sky was still filled with heavy black clouds.</t1997> <t1998>I was delighted with the thought that Jonathan had not gone to sea last night.</t1998> <t1999>But did he really not go to sea?</t1999> <t2000>Was he still on land?</t2000> <t2001>Where was he, and how were things going?</t2001> <t2002>Why was I so worried about him? If only I knew what I should do, if only I could do something, my mind would be so much more at ease.</t2002>
<t2003>• August 10</t2003>
<t2004>The funeral of the poor captain today was truly moving.</t2004> <t2005>I believe that all the ships in the port gathered at his funeral.</t2005> <t2006>The naval officers directly carried his coffin from Tate Hill to the cemetery.</t2006> <t2007>Lucy went with me.</t2007> <t2008>The two of us sat on the familiar stone bench watching the funeral procession of ships go upstream the small river to the viaduct and then return to Tate Hill.</t2008> <t2009>Sitting at the top of the cliff, we could see everything within our view.</t2009> <t2010>We observed every detail of the burial ceremony.</t2010> <t2011>Lucy was very emotional, deeply sorrowful, when she saw the captain's remains being lowered into a grave right within our sight.</t2011> <t2012>Perhaps the restless nights and continuous dreams had a very negative impact on her health.</t2012> <t2013>But strangely, when I mentioned this, Lucy absolutely refused to admit the cause of her nervous tension, even denying that she felt that way at all.</t2013> <t2014>Perhaps today, her distress increased greatly after learning that this morning, old Mr. Swales was found dead right on the bench we were sitting on, with a cut on his neck.</t2014> <t2015>According to the doctor, it was certain that before he fell, the old man must have experienced an inexplicable, tremendous terror, as that terror was still clearly etched on his face when they found his body.</t2015> <t2016>What an unfortunate old man?</t2016> <t2017>Did he see the Grim Reaper?...</t2017> <t2018>Lucy is such a sensitive girl that everything can affect her more deeply than anyone else going through the same ordeal.</t2018>
<t2019>While people were burying the unfortunate captain, she was haunted by something that didn't catch my attention at all, even though I am someone who always loves animals.</t2019><t2020>One of the men who often came here to watch the boats and the sea appeared with a dog that he always brought along.</t2020><t2021>For some reason, the dog didn't want to approach its owner, who was sitting on the same bench as us.</t2021><t2022>The dog stood some distance away, barking and growling loudly.</t2022><t2023>At first, the man gently reminded it, but the dog still wouldn't be quiet.</t2023><t2024>He then raised his voice, and angrily shouted at it.</t2024><t2025>It was useless.</t2025><t2026>The animal barked even more fiercely than before.</t2026><t2027>It was also furious, its eyes wild, fur standing on end like a porcupine's quills.</t2027><t2028>The man truly lost his temper, jumped off the bench, and kicked the dog in the stomach, then furiously grabbed it by the neck and dragged it to the stone grave where the bench was placed.</t2028><t2029>Strangely, as soon as it touched the stone, the animal fell silent, but instead, its body began to tremble violently.</t2029><t2030>Not only did it fail to calm down, but the animal also collapsed to the ground, seemingly terrified of something.</t2030><t2031>I tried to soothe it, but it was no use.</t2031><t2032>Lucy also felt sorry for the animal, but she did nothing to comfort it, only looked at it with a very worried expression.</t2032><t2033>I feared she had an incredibly sensitive and delicate instinct, adding to all that life had already given her.</t2033><t2034>I wondered how she would get through the night! All the events that had just occurred: a ship arriving at the port with a dead body right before the helm, a prolonged funeral, then the dog alternating between fury and terror - yes, all of it happened at once, causing my friend to fall into new nightmares.</t2034>
<t2035>Of course, I want Lucy to have a deep sleep tonight because of exhaustion: I mean physical exhaustion, not mental.</t2035> <t2036>Therefore, I invited her to take a long walk along the cliffs to Robin Hood's Bay, and then walk back.</t2036> <t2037>I think that tonight she won't leave her bed and wander outside while still asleep.</t2037>
<t2038>CHAPTER 8</t2038>
<t2039>Mina Murray's Journal</t2039>
<t2040>• 11 PM the same day</t2040>

<t2058>• August 11, 3 AM</t2058>
<t2059>I continue writing in my diary after being unable to sleep any longer.</t2059> <t2060>How could I sleep after that terrifying adventure? To be honest, I did manage to sleep for a while right after closing the notebook.</t2060> <t2061>However, I woke up with a start, drenched in sweat, without understanding why.</t2061> <t2062>I had the feeling that I was alone in the room; it was so dark that I couldn't see Lucy's bed.</t2062> <t2063>Only when I tiptoed closer did I realize that the bed was empty - Lucy was no longer there! I struck a match to see: she wasn't in the room!</t2063> <t2064>The door was still closed but not locked; I clearly remembered turning the lock before going to sleep.</t2064> <t2065>So Lucy had gone out.</t2065> <t2066>Not wanting to disturb Mrs. Westenra's hard-earned sleep, I quickly threw on a coat and rushed out to find her daughter.</t2066> <t2067>As I left the room, I thought that the clothes Lucy wore when she went out might give me a clue about her intentions while sleepwalking.</t2067> <t2068>If she was wearing her nightgown, she might still be somewhere in the house, but if she was wearing a dress, it meant she had gone outside.</t2068> <t2069>But her nightgown, along with all her other clothes, were still in the room.</t2069> <t2070>"Thank God!" I thought to myself, "she couldn't have gone far in the middle of the night wearing only a nightgown!" I rushed downstairs into the living room.</t2070> <t2071>Lucy wasn't there.</t2071> <t2072>I burst into all the remaining rooms, growing more anxious by the minute.</t2072> <t2073>Finally, I ran to the front door and was startled to see it wide open.</t2073> <t2074>Remembering that this door was usually locked every night, I began to fear that Lucy had gone outside with only her nightgown on.</t2074> <t2075>But I couldn't waste time thinking about what might have happened: a vague sense of dread was rising within me, making me incapable of focusing on details.</t2075> <t2076>I hurriedly ran out the door.</t2076> <t2077>When I reached Crescent Street, the clock somewhere struck a long chime, the street was deserted with not a soul in sight. I kept running without noticing a white shadow.</t2077> <t2078>Reaching the western cliff edge that jutted out over the bridge, I stopped to look around the eastern side, feeling both hopeful and fearful. I truly don't know how to describe my emotions when I saw Lucy's silhouette sitting on the familiar stone bench.</t2078> <t2079>The clear moonlight in the sky was being obscured by gathering dark clouds, leaving the world below alternately bright and dim.</t2079> <t2080>At times, I couldn't distinguish anything, as a massive dark cloud had enveloped the silhouette of St. Mary's Church and the surrounding areas.</t2080> <t2081>However, the clouds soon dispersed due to the strong winds, allowing the moonlight to once again illuminate the ruins of the abbey, then the church, and the cemetery.</t2081> <t2082>My waiting, whether hopeful or fearful, would not be in vain, for on that bench, the pale moonlight clearly revealed a white figure, half lying, half sitting.</t2082> <t2083>Another cloud quickly swept in, plunging everything back into darkness, but I still had the feeling that something very dark was standing behind the bench, bending over the white figure.</t2083> <t2084>I couldn't tell if it was a human shadow or that of an animal.</t2084> <t2085>Not wasting time waiting for the cloud to pass, I quickly slipped down to the harbor, walked along the fish market, and climbed up the bridge, as this was the only way to reach the eastern cliff.</t2085>
<t2086>The deserted city made me feel more comfortable, because after all, I didn't want the world to know the true state of my poor friend Lucy.</t2086> <t2087>Time, and even distance, seemed to stretch endlessly for me; my knees began to tremble, and I felt increasingly breathless as I climbed the stone steps leading to the monastery.</t2087> <t2088>I mustered all my strength to climb to the top as quickly as possible, yet my legs felt as heavy as lead.</t2088> <t2089>Groping near the place, I immediately recognized the stone bench and the white figure there; now I was close enough to distinguish everything in the darkness.</t2089> <t2090>There was no doubt about it, there was clearly a long, dark shadow bending over my friend.</t2090> <t2091>I blurted out, "Lucy, Lucy?" and immediately saw a head lift up along with a pale face and bright eyes.</t2091> <t2092>Not hearing Lucy respond, I dashed into the cemetery.</t2092> <t2093>The towering shadow of the church obscured my view.</t2093> <t2094>I ran around the church.</t2094> <t2095>Finally, the moonlight, free of clouds, allowed me to clearly see Lucy in a half-lying, half-sitting position, her head resting against the back of the stone bench.</t2095> <t2096>She was alone there; behind the bench, there was no trace, not even the smallest, of any living creature.</t2096>
<t2097>Lucy was sleeping very soundly, her lips slightly parted, her breathing not as smooth as usual.</t2097><t2098>It seemed she was struggling with labored breaths to draw air into her chest.</t2098><t2099>She stirred slightly and unconsciously pulled her nightgown up to cover her neck.</t2099><t2100>I suddenly noticed she was shivering from head to toe.</t2100><t2101>I gently wrapped my woolen scarf around her neck.</t2101><t2102>However, it seemed my clumsy, frightened hand had jabbed her neck, as I saw her raise her hand to rub her neck and let out a soft moan.</t2102><t2103>My long fingernail had hurt her, but she did not wake up because of it.</t2103><t2104>After putting my shoes on her feet, I dared to gently wake her up.</t2104><t2105>She let out another soft moan and exhaled deeply, but did not move any further.</t2105><t2106>Realizing that a new day was approaching, which would make it inconvenient to take Lucy back to the hotel, I had to shake her a bit more firmly.</t2106><t2107>Finally, she opened her eyes, but did not show any surprise upon seeing me, clearly still unaware of where she was.</t2107><t2108>Even in her drowsy state, Lucy looked as beautiful as ever.</t2108><t2109>Even though she had spent a cold, shivering night in a desolate graveyard, wearing only a nightgown, she had not lost her graceful charm.</t2109><t2110>Even after waking up, she was still trembling.</t2110><t2111>When I said, "Let's go home right away," she silently stood up and obediently followed like a child. On the way back, the gravel had bloodied my feet.</t2111><t2112>Seeing this, she stopped and insisted that I put on the shoes I had given her.</t2112><t2113>Of course, I refused.</t2113><t2114>Upon leaving the cemetery, I had to dip both feet in mud so that if anyone saw us, they wouldn't notice I was barefoot.</t2114><t2115>But luck smiled on Lucy and me: we made it home without encountering anyone.</t2115><t2116>Actually, there was a man on his way to get fish, but we managed to hide by the church gate until he passed.</t2116><t2117>It’s hardly worth mentioning that I was not only worried about Lucy catching a cold, but also deeply afraid of her reputation being tarnished if this incident came to light.</t2117><t2118>Once home, after washing her feet, I immediately took her to her room.</t2118><t2119>Before sleeping, she pleaded with me not to tell anyone, not even her mother.</t2119><t2120>At first, I hesitated about whether to promise her, but after thinking it over, I decided to agree, as I was also concerned about her mother's health, knowing she would be shocked by the news.</t2120><t2121>I hope I did the right thing.</t2121><t2122>I locked the door and kept the key in my hand as I lay down.</t2122><t2123>Perhaps I won't find myself in such a difficult situation again.</t2123><t2124>Lucy quickly fell back into a deep sleep.</t2124><t2125>Outside, the dawn light was glimmering on the sea...</t2125>
<t2126>• On the same day, at noon</t2126>
<t2127>Everything is fine.</t2127><t2128>Lucy slept soundly until I woke up, and it seemed she only turned over once in bed.</t2128><t2129>It appears that last night's adventure did not tire her out; on the contrary, I have the feeling she looks even more refreshed this morning, more so than she has in weeks.</t2129><t2130>However, she still looks sad, very sad indeed.</t2130><t2131>She must be recalling the terrible scene she went through on the cliff last night.</t2131><t2132>We do not want to bring up that matter again.</t2132><t2133>After dinner, Lucy complained of a headache and went back to bed.</t2133><t2134>Once she was asleep, I dared to go out; I wanted to take a walk alone on the cliffs.</t2134><t2135>To be honest, I also felt very sad because I always think of Jonathan.</t2135><t2136>When I returned, the moonlight was so bright that although the hotel was almost entirely in darkness, I could still distinguish every small object.</t2136><t2137>Looking up at the window of my room, I glimpsed Lucy's slanted shadow.</t2137><t2138>I took out my handkerchief and waved, thinking she was looking for me.</t2138><t2139>However, she did not move at all; it seemed she did not notice me.</t2139><t2140>At that moment, the clear moonlight illuminated the corner of the house, so my window was as bright as day.</t2140><t2141>I saw my friend with her eyes closed, leaning her head on the window sill.</t2141><t2142>She was sleeping, and I had the feeling there was a large bird perched beside her.</t2142><t2143>Afraid she might catch a cold, I rushed upstairs, but when I entered the room, I found her back in bed, still sleeping soundly with labored breaths, one hand clutching her neck as if to ward off the chill.</t2143><t2144>I gently pulled the blanket over her.</t2144><t2145>Now, the door is securely locked, and I have carefully latched the window as well.</t2145>
<t2146>Although she still looked very beautiful and gentle, Lucy's face now clearly showed signs of fatigue with a pale complexion.</t2146> <t2147>It seemed she was worried about something that I didn't know.</t2147> <t2148>If only I knew, my heart would be much lighter.</t2148>
<t2149>• August 15</t2149>
<t2150>We woke up later than usual.</t2150> <t2151>Lucy, perhaps because of fatigue, fell back asleep right after being awakened.</t2151> <t2152>There was a piece of unexpected good news during our breakfast: Arthur's father's health had improved significantly, and he wanted his son's wedding to be held as soon as possible.</t2152> <t2153>Lucy was overjoyed, while her mother had mixed feelings.</t2153> <t2154>She confided her emotions to me.</t2154> <t2155>She was very sad at the thought of parting with Lucy, but she was also very happy that her daughter would have a husband to take care of her day and night.</t2155> <t2156>Poor woman! While confiding in me, she said that she wouldn't live much longer.</t2156> <t2157>However, she didn't mention this to her daughter and made me promise to keep it a secret.</t2157> <t2158>She might die as if it were her fate.</t2158> <t2159>Fortunately, we didn't tell her anything about Lucy's adventure the other night!</t2159>
<t2160>• August 17</t2160>
<t2161>I haven't written a single line for the past two days; I really don't have the heart for it.</t2161> <t2162>Yes, it seems like everything is trying to discourage me at this moment.</t2162> <t2163>I haven't received any news from Jonathan, and Lucy looks more and more haggard.</t2163> <t2164>I don't understand why, as she clearly still eats well, sleeps soundly, and regularly takes walks in the fresh air.</t2164> <t2165>Yet her skin looks pale, and her breathing remains heavy and labored.</t2165> <t2166>It's been a long time since I could sleep without tying the room key to my wrist.</t2166> <t2167>Lucy often gets up to walk around the room or sits leaning against the window.</t2167> <t2168>The night before, I even saw her sticking her head out the window, and no matter how much I called, she didn't respond: she had fainted.</t2168> <t2169>Finally, when I managed to wake her, she cried silently with labored breaths.</t2169> <t2170>When I asked why she was at the window, she just shook her head and turned away.</t2170> <t2171>I hope her discomfort is not caused by the scratches on her neck.</t2171> <t2172>While she was sound asleep, I secretly checked her neck.</t2172> <t2173>The two small wounds there still haven't healed, in fact, they have widened, and the edges of the wounds are a pale pink.</t2173> <t2174>If the scratches on my friend's neck don't improve in a day or two, I might have to call a doctor.</t2174>

<t2199>• August 18</t2199>
<t2200>I am writing these lines while sitting on a cemetery bench.</t2200> <t2201>Today, Lucy seems to be better.</t2201> <t2202>Last night, she did not wake up even once.</t2202> <t2203>Although she is still pale and weak, her cheeks have a slight blush.</t2203> <t2204>She also seems happier, very happy indeed.</t2204> <t2205>She has shed her long-standing inexplicable gloom and even reminded me of the incident that happened the other night! As she spoke, she delightedly tapped her heel on the stone grave.</t2205>
<t2206>— That night, I don't know why my poor feet walked so quietly! I kept imagining old man Swales telling me that the reason I did so was because I didn't want to wake up Georgie down there!</t2206>
<t2207>Seeing her in a cheerful state, I finally dared to ask if she had any nightmares that night.</t2207> <t2208>Before answering me, she flirted in the exact manner that Arthur always liked.</t2208> <t2209>A moment later, she began to recount the story in a dreamy voice:</t2209>
<t2210>— No, I wasn't dreaming...</t2210> <t2211>Everything seemed real to me.</t2211> <t2212>I just wanted to come here, to this place, without understanding why... I was afraid of something very vague...</t2212> <t2213>I was sleeping, I wandered through the streets, then across the bridge.</t2213> <t2214>At that moment, a fish jumped out of the water, making me look down, and when I started climbing the stone steps, the dogs suddenly started barking loudly - I felt like all the dogs in the city were barking at once.</t2214> <t2215>I vaguely remember that afterwards, something long and black, with bright eyes, hovered near me.</t2215> <t2216>At the same time, a feeling both sweet and bitter surged within me.</t2216> <t2217>Then... I saw myself plunging into a deep, blue abyss, my ears ringing, my body dazed like someone about to drown.</t2217> <t2218>I felt like I no longer existed...</t2218> <t2219>My soul began to leave my body and float, wandering in the air...</t2219> <t2220>I believe I won't forget the flickering light below from the western searchlight sweeping across.</t2220> <t2221>Then I felt pain, an indescribable pain, like the feeling of falling into an earthquake.</t2221> <t2222>And finally, I returned to myself when you shook me awake.</t2222> <t2223>I saw all your gestures before I could feel them.</t2223>
<t2224>Speaking of this, my friend suddenly burst into laughter, to be honest, I started to feel worried about her unusual smile.</t2224> <t2225>I had to hold my breath listening to her laugh.</t2225> <t2226>Her laughter really made me uncomfortable.</t2226>
<t2227>It's better not to let her think about that wandering adventure anymore.</t2227> <t2228>Thinking so, I immediately tried to steer the conversation to another topic to bring her back to herself.</t2228>
<t2229>When we returned to the hotel, the gentle sea breezes made her cheeks blush pink.</t2229> <t2230>Her mother was very happy to see her looking so rosy.</t2230>
<t2231>All three of us had a really good evening.</t2231>
<t2232>• August 19</t2232>
<t2233>I feel so happy! But is that already a true happiness?</t2233> <t2234>No, not quite yet.</t2234> <t2235>But finally, I have received news from Jonathan.</t2235> <t2236>Poor thing, he has been ill all this time, so he didn't want to write anything.</t2236> <t2237>Now I feel somewhat at ease.</t2237> <t2238>Mr. Hawkins just forwarded me the letter that the nun taking care of Jonathan sent to him.</t2238> <t2239>Tomorrow, I will set out to find him, and if necessary, I will help take care of him, and then we will return to England together. Mr. Hawkins advised me to have the wedding there.</t2239> <t2240>I couldn't hold back my tears when reading the letter from that kind-hearted nun.</t2240> <t2241>After reading the letter, I immediately put it in my chest pocket, closest to my heart!</t2241> <t2242>This letter will be my source of comfort until I meet Jonathan.</t2242> <t2243>All my luggage is ready, I am prepared to set out to find my fiancé.</t2243>
<t2244>Sister Agatha at the Saint Joseph and Saint Marie Institute, Budapest, sends to Wilhelmina Murray</t2244>
<t2245>“August 12th</t2245>
<t2246>Dear Madam,</t2246>
<t2247>By the grace of God, Saint Joseph, and Saint Mary, Mr. Jonathan's health condition has been improving day by day.</t2247> <t2248>However, he is still too weak to write a letter himself, so he has asked me to write these lines to you.</t2248> <t2249>He has been bedridden with us for nearly six weeks due to a rather severe brain illness.</t2249> <t2250>He asked me to write to you that he always remembers you, and that along with this letter to you, I am also writing another letter to Mr. Peter Hawkins, in which I must express his regrets for not being able to inform him of his condition sooner.</t2250> <t2251>Mr. Jonathan needs to rest a few more weeks at our sanatorium before he can return to England.</t2251> <t2252>He also asked me to tell you that he needs a certain amount of money to reciprocate the kindness of the sanatorium during his stay here, as the sanatorium is also in great need of assistance to be able to care for other patients.</t2252>
<t2253>I deeply sympathize with you, and I hope you will accept my deepest condolences.</t2253>
<t2254>Sister Agatha.</t2254>
<t2255>T. B.</t2255> <t2256>My patient has fallen asleep, so I am opening the letter again to write you a few more lines.</t2256>
<t2257>He told me a lot about you and informed me that the two of you will soon be getting married.</t2257> <t2258>Heartfelt congratulations to you and your husband! According to the doctor, your husband went through a terrible shock, and during his delirium, he only spoke of very frightening things.</t2258> <t2259>I personally heard him rambling about wolves, poison, blood; about ghosts and demons; and many other things that I dare not mention.</t2259>
<t2260>I would advise you that for a long time, you should not bring up these frightening stories with your husband; what is deeply ingrained in his thoughts surely cannot be easily erased.</t2260> <t2261>We should have informed you of this long ago, but the unfortunate thing is we did not know whom to write to, as we did not have any address of friends, relatives, or the patient's parents, and he did not have any documents on him that could help us find a contact address.</t2261> <t2262>He came to us after a train trip from Klausenburg, and the station master recounted that before boarding the train, your husband had rushed madly into the station and shouted that he needed a ticket back to England. Knowing he was English, the station master gave him a ticket to the nearest station.</t2262>
<t2263>Please rest assured, your husband has been taken care of very thoroughly.</t2263> <t2264>His kindness and pain have truly moved everyone here.</t2264> <t2265>As I mentioned at the beginning of the letter, your husband's health is progressing very well, but I must reiterate that in the future, you should be very careful in taking care of him, especially regarding his mental stability.</t2265> <t2266>I have prayed to God, Saint Joseph, and Saint Mary to bless both of you until your hair turns gray and your teeth fall out.</t2266>
<t2267>Dr. Seward's Diary</t2267>
<t2268>• August 19</t2268>
<t2269>Last night, there were unexpected and strange changes in Renfield.</t2269> <t2270>Around 8 o'clock, he suddenly became very agitated, crawling on the floor with his hands, sniffing the ground like a dog scenting something.</t2270> <t2271>Seeing this bizarre scene and knowing that I was very interested in him, the warden asked him the reason why.</t2271> <t2272>Normally, Renfield showed great respect for this warden, and sometimes he even obeyed him like a slave.</t2272> <t2273>But according to what the warden told me, this time it wasn't like that: Renfield was disdainful and didn't bother to answer his question.</t2273> <t2274>He only said one sentence to him:</t2274>
<t2275>— I don't want to talk to you.</t2275> <t2276>To me, you no longer exist in this world; my master is nearby.</t2276>
<t2277>The warden believed that he had begun to suffer from a mysterious madness.</t2277> <t2278>If this were indeed the case, then surely there would come a time when we would witness unforeseeable scenes, for a strong man like him, if afflicted by a mysterious and homicidal mental illness, could become dangerous, very dangerous indeed.</t2278> <t2279>I visited him at 9 o'clock.</t2279> <t2280>He behaved towards me exactly as he had behaved towards the warden earlier.</t2280> <t2281>It seemed that in his current mental state, he could no longer distinguish the difference between me and the warden.</t2281> <t2282>Perhaps at some point, he would consider himself to be God?</t2282> <t2283>But his poor ability to distinguish between two people hardly qualifies him to become a Supreme Being!</t2283>
<t2284>For half an hour or more, Renfield became increasingly agitated.</t2284> <t2285>Although outwardly I always appeared indifferent to him, in reality, I quietly observed his every move.</t2285> <t2286>I suddenly noticed a certain cunning in his eyes, the kind of cunning that madmen always have when they are plotting something - an aspect that asylum wardens are very familiar with.</t2286> <t2287>Then, he suddenly became completely silent and sat down heavily on the edge of the bed, his face showing a clear expression of resignation.</t2287> <t2288>He began to stare into the distance with a vague, inscrutable look in his eyes.</t2288> <t2289>I didn't know whether his emotions were real or fake, so I decided to test him by bringing up his little animals - a topic he was always very attentive to.</t2289>
<t2290>At first, he didn't say anything, but eventually, he got annoyed and spoke up:</t2290>
<t2291>— Throw it all away! They mean nothing to me now...</t2291>
<t2292>— What? - I interrupted him. - You’re not going to tell me that you no longer care about the spiders, are you? (Because his hobby these past few days has been the spiders, and his notebook is filled with numbers).</t2292>
<t2293>When I asked that, he responded in a really incomprehensible voice:</t2293>
<t2294>— Distinguished ladies always please those who are waiting for the bride to appear, but once the bride appears, the distinguished ladies no longer matter to those guests.</t2294>
<t2295>He didn't explain anything further and just sat at the edge of the bed the entire time I remained in his room.</t2295> <t2296>Tonight I feel so exhausted, my body wilting like a withered leaf.</t2296> <t2297>The thought of Lucy continuously haunts me, and every time I think of her, I can't help but wonder if the situation might change?</t2297>
<t2298>Tonight, if I can't quickly fall asleep after lying down, I might have to reluctantly take a newly developed sleeping pill - the type C2HCl3O. H2O.</t2298> <t2299>Of course, I must try not to let this become a habit.</t2299> <t2300>No, tonight I will definitely not use any sedatives.</t2300> <t2301>To be honest, I have thought a lot about Lucy, and I don't intend to erase the sweet memory of her at any cost.</t2301> <t2302>Tonight, I will once again not sleep.</t2302>
<t2303>I had just been lying awake for a while when the clock chimed twice - so it was only 2 AM!</t2303> <t2304>I had just turned over wearily when I suddenly heard a knock on the door; the night attendant came to inform me that patient Renfield had escaped!</t2304> <t2305>I hurriedly dressed and rushed down the stairs.</t2305> <t2306>It would indeed be very dangerous if my patient were to wander freely around the surrounding areas.</t2306> <t2307>His stubborn thoughts could pose a real threat to anyone he encountered on the road.</t2307> <t2308>The warden was waiting for me.</t2308> <t2309>About ten minutes earlier, through a small hole in the door, he had still seen Renfield lying on the bed, seemingly asleep.</t2309> <t2310>But then, he was startled when he heard a noise outside the window.</t2310> <t2311>He ran to Renfield's room door but didn't see him there anymore: had he jumped out the window to escape?</t2311> <t2312>He immediately sent someone to call me.</t2312> <t2313>According to the warden, Renfield, wearing only a nightgown, couldn't have gone far.</t2313> <t2314>He asserted that Renfield had run to the left and then straight ahead.</t2314> <t2315>I also quickly jumped out the window into the yard, of course with the warden's assistance, and hurriedly ran in that direction.</t2315> <t2316>As I neared the bushes, I suddenly noticed a faint white figure climbing the wall that separated our garden from the garden of an abandoned house.</t2316>
<t2317>I ran back to tell the night watchman to call three or four more people to come with me to Carfax, in case Renfield turned aggressive if we had to bring him back.</t2317> <t2318>I took a ladder, climbed over the wall, and jumped to the other side.</t2318> <t2319>As soon as my feet touched the ground, I immediately recognized Renfield's shadow disappearing behind the house.</t2319> <t2320>I hurriedly chased after him.</t2320> <t2321>When I reached the corner of the house, I saw him furiously pushing against the oak door of the chapel.</t2321> <t2322>It seemed like he was talking to someone, but I didn't dare get closer for fear he would recognize me and run away.</t2322> <t2323>Teasing a bee is not as difficult as catching a madman plotting to escape!</t2323> <t2324>However, after a few minutes of observation, I realized he wasn't paying any attention to what was happening around him, so I boldly moved closer, feeling reassured that the people I had just called for help had probably also climbed over the wall and were preparing to surround him.</t2324> <t2325>At this point, I could clearly hear what he was saying:</t2325>
<t2326>— I submit to you, master.</t2326> <t2327>I am your slave and I know that you will reward me, for I am always loyal to you.</t2327> <t2328>I have admired you for a long, long time!</t2328> <t2329>Now that you are here, I will await your orders, and you won't forget to share the wealth with me, will you, master?</t2329>
<t2330>It truly was the voice of a beggar!</t2330> <t2331>His eccentricity was beyond words.</t2331> <t2332>When we grabbed him by the arms, he struggled wildly like a tiger, because he resembled a wild beast more than a human being.</t2332> <t2333>Never had I encountered a mental patient so strong and aggressive, and I hope this will be the last time! Fortunately, I anticipated the situation and managed to call for additional help in time.</t2333> <t2334>I dare not think about what he might have done if we hadn't managed to bring him back! On the way back, he occasionally let out terrifying roars, but the silence that followed each of his cries worried us just as much, for we had already guessed his deadly intentions.</t2334>
<t2335>The first time I heard him speak in broken sentences:</t2335>
<t2336>— I will be patient, master! I will wait... wait... wait...</t2336>
<t2337>Me too, I will wait!</t2337>
<t2338>CHAPTER 9</t2338>
<t2339>Mina Harker's letter to Lucy Westenra</t2339>
<t2340>“Budapest, August 24”</t2340>
<t2341>Dear Lucy, I know you are very anxious to know everything that has happened since we parted ways at Whitby station.</t2341> <t2342>I'll tell you! To Hull, I took a ship to Hamburg and from there, I took a train back here.</t2342> <t2343>It would be a bit tiring if I had to recall all the details of my journey.</t2343> <t2344>When I realized I had to find Jonathan and take care of him, I only thought of one thing: to sleep as much as possible.</t2344> <t2345>I met Jonathan, he looked emaciated, pale, and in a very poor state of health.</t2345> <t2346>In his eyes, there was no longer the resolute, calm look that I often described to you, instead, there was a dark gaze that did not recall anything that had happened to him recently, at least that was my impression when I first met him.</t2346> <t2347>Jonathan had gone through a real shock, and I fear that even if his memory is restored, he still won't be able to bear the recollection of what happened to him.</t2347> <t2348>Sister Agatha, a wonderful believer and a kind nurse, recounted that Jonathan only spoke of terrible things while delirious.</t2348> <t2349>I wanted to know more details, but Sister Agatha said that it was impossible, because everything a patient utters in delirium is considered God's secret, and if overheard, all doctors are obliged to keep this secret.</t2349> <t2350>However, the next day, knowing I was very worried, the sister met me and said: “All I can tell you is that your husband often spoke of a mistake he made.</t2350> <t2351>And you, who will soon become his wife, had nothing to do with this mistake.</t2351> <t2352>Your husband has not forgotten you, nor has he forgotten everything you have done for him.</t2352> <t2353>His worries stem from the terrible things that anyone, being human, would find hard to forget.”</t2353> <t2354>Perhaps the kind sister feared I was jealous, thinking that my fiancé had fallen in love with another girl!</t2354> <t2355>Jealous of a girl my beloved had fallen for! Jealousy?</t2355> <t2356>I have always trusted in Jonathan's love!</t2356> <t2357>My dear friend, now I can tell you that there is no woman who is the cause of his poor mental state.</t2357> <t2358>As I write to you, I am watching him sleep...</t2358> <t2359>He has woken up!</t2359>
<t2360>As soon as he woke up, he asked me about the notebook kept in his jacket pocket.</t2360> <t2361>I intended to beg him to let me read the notes in it - because I knew I would find clues to guess the cause of his breakdown, but it seemed he had guessed that intention from the look in my eyes, as he suggested I move near the window, he wanted to be alone.</t2361> <t2362>A moment later, he called me back, still holding the notebook, and spoke to me in a very serious tone:</t2362>
<t2363>— Wilhelmina, - Yes, what he intends to confide in me must be very serious, my dear friend, because since we fell in love, this is the first time he has mentioned my given name - surely you know what he is thinking about the trust that must exist between a wife and a husband.</t2363> <t2364>They should not hide anything from each other, and there should be no secrets kept by either.</t2364> <t2365>Therefore, I can confess to you that I have gone through a terrible shock; and now, as I try to recall what happened to me, I no longer know if it was real or just a nightmare.</t2365> <t2366>People have told you that I have a brain disease, like a kind of mental illness, isn't it frightening?</t2366> <t2367>The secret of what happened to me lies in these pages, but I don't want to mention it anymore.</t2367> <t2368>I want my life, and our wedding as well, to start from scratch.</t2368> <t2369>(Because, my dear friend, we will get married here, right after all the procedures are completed) Wilhelmina, do you want to share this innocence with me?</t2369> <t2370>Here is the notebook, take it and keep it, and if you want, you can read everything I have written, but remember never to mention any of it to me, I don't want to recall that terrible chapter... unless some duty compels me to do so.</t2370>
<t2371>After saying that much, Jonathan fell asleep again due to exhaustion.</t2371> <t2372>I hugged him while slipping the notebook under his pillow.</t2372> <t2373>Sister Agatha had gone to the Cathedral of Our Lady on my behalf to pray for our wedding, which is to take place this afternoon.</t2373> <t2374>I am eagerly awaiting her response.</t2374>
<t2375>The nun came back and told me that she had asked someone to find the chaplain of the Church of England. Within an hour, or perhaps sooner, maybe right after Jonathan wakes up, we will get married.</t2375>
<t2376>Lucy, do you know, many hours have passed since I put pen to paper...</t2376><t2377>Time passes so slowly for me! But anyhow, now I feel overflowing with happiness! When Jonathan woke up, everything was ready.</t2377><t2378>He struggled to sit up against the pillows on the bed and answered with a determined voice, "yes".</t2378><t2379>As for me, I could only say very softly, overwhelming happiness made me sob with emotion.</t2379><t2380>The devotees here are so dedicated to us! God wants me to never forget them, to never forget the heavy but gentle responsibilities I have to bear!</t2380><t2381>Perhaps now I should tell you about my wedding gift.</t2381><t2382>When the chaplain and the nuns left me alone with my husband.</t2382><t2383>Oh! Lucy, this is the first time I get to write these words: my husband, I took the notebook from under his pillow, wrapped it in silver paper, and tied it with a bow like a real gift.</t2383><t2384>I placed a kiss on it and told my husband that I would keep this memento for life as a testament to my faith in him and that I would never open the notebook unless it was for his benefit or in a truly urgent situation.</t2384><t2385>He took my hand...</t2385><t2386>Oh! Lucy, this is the first time he held his wife's hand...</t2386><t2387>He replied to me that he would engrave my heart's sentiment in his and to be worthy of my affection, he would revive the past if necessary.</t2387><t2388>Clearly, my poor man was ready to reveal a part of his past, but he couldn't determine the time that had passed, and I wouldn't be surprised if at some point, he not only forgets the days but also the years.</t2388>
<t2389>What else could I possibly criticize him for? Just being able to whisper to him that I am the happiest woman in the world, that I have nothing else to offer him but my own life, my heart, my love, and my duty to him, is already more than enough for me.</t2389> <t2390>And when he holds me in his arms and tightly grasps my hand with his frail, thin hands, I feel as though we are once again making a serious promise to each other.</t2390>
<t2391>Dear Lucy, do you know why I tell you everything?</t2391> <t2392>It's not just a sweet love story as you might guess, but also because you have always been a great friend to me, and always will be.</t2392> <t2393>I still consider myself fortunate to have you as a friend, and now I am eagerly hoping that you too will experience the happiness I have just grasped.</t2393> <t2394>Oh Lucy, may God bless you, may He grant you the promises for your earthly struggles: a long day filled with sunshine, a peaceful day without storms, without forgetfulness, without doubt.</t2394> <t2395>I won't wish for you to never face hardships, for that is unrealistic, but once again I wish for you to enjoy a complete and sweet happiness like I am feeling now: Goodbye, dear friend.</t2395> <t2396>I will drop this letter in the mail right away, and will write again soon to keep you from feeling lonely.</t2396> <t2397>I have to say goodbye for now, as Jonathan has just woken up...</t2397> <t2398>I need to check if my husband needs anything.</t2398>
<t2399>Your eternal friend, Mina Harker</t2399>
<t2400>Letter from Lucy Westenra to Mina Harker</t2400>
<t2401>"Whitby, August 30"</t2401>
<t2402>Dear Mina,</t2402>
<t2403>I wish to give you an ocean of friendship, millions of kisses, and hope that you will soon return home with your newlywed husband! If you return to England soon, remember to visit Whitby with me for a few days.</t2403> <t2404>The fresh sea air will help Jonathan recover best - it was the air here that helped me fully recover; now I can sleep very well, and I feel full of life.</t2404> <t2405>I believe you will be very happy to know that I no longer wander in my sleep.</t2405> <t2406>It's been a week since I last got out of bed - I mean at night!</t2406> <t2407>Arthur says I've noticeably gained weight.</t2407> <t2408>Oh, I forgot to tell you that Arthur is here.</t2408> <t2409>Every day we go for walks, play tennis or fish, and ride horses together.</t2409> <t2410>I love him more than ever.</t2410> <t2411>He also says he feels he loves me more and more each day.</t2411> <t2412>I don't quite believe it, because at first, he told me that he couldn't love me more than he already does...</t2412> <t2413>There, he's calling me again...</t2413> <t2414>Perhaps I should say goodbye to you here.</t2414>
<t2415>Your dear Lucy.</t2415>
<t2416>T. B.</t2416> <t2417>My mom sends you her best wishes.</t2417> <t2418>Her health is a bit better now.</t2418>
<t2419>One more thing: we will get married on September 28th.</t2419>
<t2420>Dr. Seward's Diary</t2420>
<t2421>• August 22</t2421>
<t2422>Renfield's case is becoming increasingly complex and also more interesting: suddenly he has become very calm.</t2422> <t2423>But after the recent escape attempt, he continuously exhibited violent behavior for several days.</t2423> <t2424>Then one evening, when the moonlight awakened, he suddenly calmed down and muttered to himself countless times: "Now I can wait... I can wait..."</t2424> <t2425>Hearing the warden report this, I immediately ran down and understood what was happening.</t2425> <t2426>Renfield, still confined in his room and wearing a straitjacket specifically for the insane, no longer had the ferocious look he had in the past few days; his eyes now had a certain gentle, pleading quality.</t2426> <t2427>I ordered him to be loosened.</t2427> <t2428>The attendant hesitated, but eventually complied with my instructions.</t2428> <t2429>Strangely enough, the patient somehow immediately recognized the suspicion of those watching him, as he tiptoed over and whispered in my ear, while still sneaking glances at them:</t2429>
<t2430>— They must be thinking that I'm about to give you a good beating? How could I ever do such a thing! What a bunch of fools!</t2430>
<t2431>In short, no matter what is said, it is truly not alarming to make an observation that even in the mind of this unfortunate person, I have many differences compared to my subordinates.</t2431> <t2432>However, I still cannot grasp his thoughts.</t2432> <t2433>Moreover, is it necessary to understand that I have something in common with him, leading others to say that he and I will stand on the same shore? Or is he patiently waiting for some goodwill from me, so that at some point he will call me his ally? I will try to understand the issue.</t2433> <t2434>Tonight, he was determined not to open his mouth to say anything.</t2434> <t2435>Even when someone brought him a cat, a large cat at that, he only said a few words: "I no longer care about those filthy cats.</t2435> <t2436>Now there are many other things that concern me, and I can wait... I can wait...”</t2436>
<t2437>The warden told me that when I left his room, he sat in silence until morning.</t2437> <t2438>After that, he started acting up again, and this time, his madness made him so aggressive that he fainted and fell into a coma.</t2438>
<t2439>The event has been happening like this for three days already.</t2439> <t2440>First, there were violent fits of madness, followed by hours of sitting still throughout the night.</t2440> <t2441>I must find the cause of these cyclical bouts of madness.</t2441> <t2442>It is possible that my patient has been subjected to some influence.</t2442> <t2443>If that is the case, then tonight we will pit sound minds against the sick ones!</t2443> <t2444>The other day, Renfield escaped despite our precautions.</t2444> <t2445>Tonight, we will help him escape.</t2445> <t2446>We will give him a chance, and the guards will be ready to follow him...</t2446>
<t2447>• August 23</t2447>
<t2448>The incident did not go as we expected!</t2448> <t2449>Even though the cage door was open, our bird still refused to fly away.</t2449> <t2450>So all our arrangements and preparations were in vain!</t2450>
<t2451>However, there is one thing that has been confirmed: the stubborn phases of the patient have been shortened.</t2451> <t2452>From now on, we will let him be free for a few hours each day.</t2452> <t2453>I told the night shift warden not to lock him in the insane cell when he is in a normal state, and only to put him in there about an hour before sunrise.</t2453> <t2454>He seems very pleased with this half-freedom regime even when his mind is not yet capable of evaluating and perceiving things.</t2454> <t2455>However, someone came running to call me in a panic!...</t2455> <t2456>The thing I did not expect happened once again: the patient has escaped.</t2456>
<t2457>• On the same day, a little while later</t2457>
<t2458>Another adventure tonight.</t2458> <t2459>Renfield waited for the warden to enter the room and took advantage of the moment he was busy with something to run quickly into the hallway.</t2459> <t2460>I hurriedly ordered the night guards to chase after him.</t2460> <t2461>Just like the last time, he headed towards the abandoned house, and we still saw him pushing his whole body against the oak door of the old church.</t2461> <t2462>Seeing me arrive with a guard, he went into a frenzy, and if my men hadn't grabbed his hands in time, he might have torn me apart.</t2462> <t2463>Surrounded and subdued by us, he became even more ferocious, but shortly after, he suddenly calmed down, which surprised me greatly.</t2463> <t2464>I looked around: there was nothing unusual.</t2464> <t2465>Following his gaze, I also didn't notice anything unusual in the moonlit sky, except for a large bat fluttering westward like a ghost.</t2465> <t2466>I've heard that bats usually fly back and forth in one place, but that bat was different; it seemed to be flying towards a specific destination.</t2466>
<t2467>Renfield said to us, in a very gentle voice:</t2467>
<t2468>— You don't need to hold me so tightly, I can go back on my own, just calm down!</t2468>
<t2469>It is true that we returned without encountering any trouble, but the sudden and inexplicable silence of the patient did not convey anything that could reassure me, and I should not forget what just happened.</t2469>
<t2470>Lucy Westenra's diary</t2470>
<t2471>• Hillingham, August 24</t2471>
<t2472>I also intended to sit down and write a diary like Mina, so that when we meet again, we can sit and talk at length about everything I have recorded here.</t2472> <t2473>But when will we meet again?</t2473> <t2474>I wish Mina were here right now, because I am feeling very sad!</t2474> <t2475>Last night, I had the feeling that I was about to repeat the dreams I had in Whitby, maybe because of the weather change, or maybe because of my return home...</t2475> <t2476>The most terrible thing is that I don't remember anything at all.</t2476> <t2477>Moreover, I always feel scared, a vague fear that I don't understand why.</t2477> <t2478>I am becoming weaker and thinner every day.</t2478> <t2479>When he came to have lunch with us, Arthur seemed very sad when he looked at me.</t2479> <t2480>I am so tired that I can't even try to be cheerful.</t2480> <t2481>I wondered if I would have to sleep in the same room with my mother tonight.</t2481> <t2482>I hope I will have a good night's sleep there.</t2482> <t2483>I will find a reason to ask my mother's permission.</t2483>
<t2484>• August 25</t2484>
<t2485>Another terrible night.</t2485> <t2486>My suggestion seemed to have not pleased my mother.</t2486> <t2487>She herself was not feeling very well.</t2487> <t2488>Moreover, she was probably afraid of disturbing my sleep if we shared a room.</t2488> <t2489>So I still had to sleep in my own room, and in fact, I did get some sleep, but the long chime at midnight woke me up.</t2489> <t2490>I suddenly heard strange sounds like someone scratching at the door, or rather the flapping of wings.</t2490> <t2491>But I didn't wonder about it for long, and honestly, I don't remember anything else.</t2491> <t2492>I went back to sleep right after that.</t2492> <t2493>Again, nightmares.</t2493> <t2494>If only I could remember everything...</t2494>
<t2495>In the morning, I felt terribly weak.</t2495> <t2496>My face was as pale as someone about to enter the grave, and I also felt pain in my neck... it seemed like there was a problem with my chest too, occasionally I found it very hard to breathe.</t2496> <t2497>But no matter what, I still tried to appear a bit cheerful in front of Arthur, otherwise, he would be very sad again.</t2497>
<t2498>Letter from Arthur Holmwood to Dr. Seward</t2498>
<t2499>"Albemarle Hotel, August 31"</t2499>
<t2500>I want to ask you a favor.</t2500> <t2501>Lucy is falling ill, not with a specific disease, but with some kind of illness that is really hard to identify.</t2501> <t2502>Her health is deteriorating day by day, making me unable to stop worrying.</t2502> <t2503>Mrs. Westenra confided in me that she doesn't have much longer to live, but Lucy is still unaware of this.</t2503> <t2504>I don't know how Lucy will endure in her current health condition.</t2504> <t2505>I am certain that my poor fiancée, despite always telling me otherwise, is still secretly hiding something that I cannot know.</t2505> <t2506>I must reiterate that I am very worried.</t2506> <t2507>Everything is so vague.</t2507> <t2508>Seeing her at this moment is truly a pain for me.</t2508> <t2509>I suggested that you come to check on her, and finally, she has agreed.</t2509> <t2510>It might be really hard for you, but Lucy's health is a very important issue.</t2510>
<t2511>We must act quickly, for her health cannot be delayed another day, am I right, my friend?</t2511> <t2512>Can you come?</t2512> <t2513>This way, we won't arouse any suspicion from Mrs. Westenra: after lunch, as previously arranged, Lucy will spend some time alone with you.</t2513> <t2514>For the last time, I must reiterate that I am worried to the point of madness, and I am very anxious to know what your conclusion will be regarding her condition.</t2514> <t2515>Please come immediately!</t2515>

<t2517>Letter from Dr. Seward to Arthur Holmwood</t2517>
<t2518>"September 2"</t2518>
<t2519>Hello dear friend.</t2519>
<t2520>I must tell you right away that, in my opinion, Lucy Westenra is not suffering from any illness or functional disorder.</t2520> <t2521>However, I was truly shocked when I saw her.</t2521> <t2522>Good Lord! Lucy now is not the same Lucy I met the last time.</t2522> <t2523>Of course, I do not forget that I was unable to examine her as I had hoped: our friendship made the examination more difficult and delicate.</t2523> <t2524>I will tell you in detail about this visit, and from my explanations, you can draw your own conclusions.</t2524> <t2525>Therefore, I will only recount to you what I have done and what I am planning to do at this moment.</t2525>
<t2526>Seeing me arrive at Hillingham, Lucy appeared very cheerful and innocent.</t2526> <t2527>Her mother also stood close to her, and it didn't take me long to realize that she couldn't hide her condition forever with the hope of not causing her daughter anxiety and distress.</t2527> <t2528>Mrs. Westenra's caution was indeed necessary, but I still believed that at some point, her daughter would figure out her health condition, even if no one told her.</t2528> <t2529>I had lunch with the family, and without saying a word, all three of us silently tried to appear cheerful and carefree.</t2529> <t2530>These efforts were well rewarded: we genuinely had fun for at least an hour.</t2530> <t2531>Afterward, Mrs. Westenra said she wanted to rest, leaving me alone with Lucy. Until we moved to the living room to talk, Lucy kept up a cheerful demeanor, as the servants were constantly coming and going.</t2531> <t2532>But as soon as the door closed, she collapsed into a chair, covering her face with her hands and sighing.</t2532> <t2533>She could no longer keep up the act.</t2533> <t2534>I had to ask why she was sighing.</t2534>
<t2535>— If only I had known you didn't like talking about yourself, I wouldn't have asked that - She exclaimed.</t2535>
<t2536>I have to tell her that there is nothing to worry about when confiding all her concerns to a doctor; however, I also admit that he is very worried about her.</t2536>
<t2537>She immediately grasped the situation, and with just a few words, I was able to freely start a conversation:</t2537>
<t2538>— You can tell Arthur everything you want to say.</t2538> <t2539>If I have any worries, it's not for myself, but for him!</t2539>
<t2540>That is why I have to tell you my thoughts.</t2540><t2541>I immediately noticed that Lucy was suffering from anemia, although she showed no specific signs of the disease.</t2541><t2542>Moreover, by chance, I was able to check her blood levels because she had a slight injury when opening the window.</t2542><t2543>Of course, it was nothing serious, but it was enough for me to take a few drops of blood for analysis.</t2543><t2544>The test results were very good.</t2544><t2545>On the other hand, I did not see any worrying symptoms.</t2545><t2546>However, when this anemia clearly stems from a specific cause, it must be due to some mental instability.</t2546><t2547>Lucy also complained of shortness of breath and heavy, laborious sleep, similar to a stupor, often accompanied by terrible nightmares that her memory did not record any specific details of.</t2547><t2548>Lucy told me that as a child, she suffered from sleepwalking, and this summer in Whitby, the condition clung to her again. One night, still in a sleepwalking state, she left the hotel and climbed a steep cliff where Mina Murray found her. However, she reassured me that she has had peaceful nights recently.</t2548><t2549>Not being very knowledgeable about this type of pathology, I did what I thought was best: I wrote to my old friend and mentor, Professor Van Helsing, a master expert on similar diseases in Amsterdam.</t2549><t2550>I asked Van Helsing to visit Lucy, and as he mentioned in his letter to me, he would cover all the costs of the trip, as I had told him that you are Lucy's fiancé.</t2550><t2551>Anyway, I want to help Lucy to the best of my ability.</t2551><t2552>As for Van Helsing, I am sure he will do his utmost for me.</t2552><t2553>Therefore, when the professor arrives, we should follow his decisions.</t2553><t2554>In some situations, the professor may appear authoritarian, but he truly knows what he is talking about, so please do not be obstinate.</t2554><t2555>Van Helsing is both a philosopher and a metaphysician - he deserves to be one of the greatest scholars of our time.</t2555><t2556>Therefore, I believe he will have an open mind to all possibilities.</t2556><t2557>Moreover, the professor has nerves of steel, a resolute character, an iron will that always sees things through, a commendable self-discipline, and finally, an infinite kindness. These are the admirable qualities of the professor, a man who dedicates himself wholeheartedly to his humanitarian mission.</t2557>
<t2558>I say this so that you can understand why I trust this professor so much.</t2558> <t2559>I have asked him to temporarily stop all work at home.</t2559> <t2560>Tomorrow, I will visit Lucy Westenra again, but not at her home, because I do not want my frequent visits to worry her mother.</t2560>
<t2561>Wishing you all the best.</t2561>

<t2565>Dear friend,</t2565>
<t2566>I have received your letter and of course I will come!</t2566>
<t2567>I can come immediately without encountering any obstacles, none of my patients need me for the next day or two.</t2567><t2568>I would feel very sorry for them if something unexpected happened, but truly nothing can prevent me from helping those considered the closest.</t2568><t2569>Helping a close friend of yours is indeed a great honor for me.</t2569><t2570>Don't worry about the money.</t2570><t2571>Please book me a room at the Grand Phuong Dong Hotel near the patient's residence, and inform that young lady that we will visit her tomorrow morning, as I might have to return here tomorrow evening.</t2571><t2572>But if that happens, I will return to London in three days and then, I can stay longer.</t2572><t2573>Goodbye, my friend!</t2573>

<t2575>Letter from Dr. Seward to Arthur Holmwood</t2575>
<t2576>"September 3rd"</t2576>
<t2577>Dear Arthur,</t2577>
<t2578>Van Helsing has come and gone again.</t2578> <t2579>He accompanied me to Hillingham.</t2579> <t2580>Mrs. Westenra went out for lunch, so it was just us with Lucy. Van Helsing examined her very seriously and thoroughly.</t2580> <t2581>He recounted to me the results of his diagnosis, as I was not present for the entire examination.</t2581> <t2582>He seemed very worried because he had not yet accurately diagnosed Lucy's illness; he told me that he needed to think and further investigate her condition.</t2582> <t2583>When I spoke about our friendship and the trust he had placed in me regarding Lucy's examination and treatment, Van Helsing replied to me: “You must absolutely keep secret what you are thinking, and everything I am thinking if you can guess my thoughts.</t2583> <t2584>I am not joking; this is a matter of life and death, and it could involve other serious issues as well...</t2584>
<t2585>Hearing Van Helsing's serious tone on the way back to the city, I was compelled to ask more questions, but he still refused to explain further.</t2585> <t2586>Arthur, please don't blame me! Professor Van Helsing's silence indicates that he is thinking a lot about the patient and is meticulously studying this case with all his scientific knowledge.</t2586> <t2587>Please believe that the professor will explain more clearly when you know everything you need to know.</t2587> <t2588>That's why I had to tell the professor that I would limit what I say about this medical visit to you, Arthur.</t2588> <t2589>Maybe tomorrow I will receive the professor's conclusion.</t2589> <t2590>Anyway, I am anxiously waiting for a letter.</t2590>
<t2591>And now it is the visit of our teacher and us.</t2591> <t2592>Lucy seems happier than the previous day, and her complexion also looks better.</t2592> <t2593>She no longer looks with the eyes that used to make him fearful, and her breathing has returned to normal.</t2593> <t2594>To the professor (as well as to everyone else), she appeared very lovely, and she tried to behave as naturally as possible.</t2594> <t2595>However, in my opinion, to be so cheerful, the poor girl must have struggled tremendously with herself.</t2595> <t2596>I believe Van Helsing thought the same as I did, because I saw the professor quickly furrow his brow when he looked at her.</t2596> <t2597>The professor chatted about various topics, except about ourselves and the patients, because he really wanted to bring true joy to Lucy.</t2597> <t2598>And while pretending to continue the flow of conversation, the professor slowly revealed the purpose of his visit:</t2598>
<t2599>— My dear friend, - the professor began to explain - indeed, I am very honored to visit you, because my friend here wants us to act for a great love.</t2599> <t2600>And that is a truly precious sentiment, please believe me! Before coming here, my friend said that you looked very pale and weak.</t2600> <t2601>I replied: "Oh dear..."</t2601> <t2602>I did not believe what he said.</t2602> <t2603>Now you and I will prove to him that he was wrong.</t2603> <t2604>How could he - the professor said while looking at and pointing to me exactly the same way he did to me once, when I caused an accident while studying under him, which I still haven't forgotten - how could he possibly understand anything thoroughly about young girls? He should be busy caring for his patients, helping them find happiness, and returning them to their loved ones.</t2604> <t2605>The reward for a doctor's efforts like his is seeing the happiness of each patient.</t2605> <t2606>As for young girls! He doesn't have a wife, and of course, no daughters either, and young girls never trust young men, they only trust old men, those who have gone through many hardships and bitterness throughout their lives, which even they sometimes haven't fully realized.</t2606> <t2607>So, my dear, let him go out to the garden to smoke, and we will sit here and chat about some trivial matters.</t2607>
<t2608>Knowing the professor's intention, I quietly went outside to walk around the house.</t2608> <t2609>But not long after, I heard the professor calling through the window.</t2609> <t2610>When we met again, he informed me:</t2610>
<t2611>— I have examined very thoroughly but still do not see any signs of functional decline.</t2611> <t2612>Like you, I think perhaps she lost a lot of blood, I say lost, do you hear me clearly? I say that because she is no longer losing blood now.</t2612> <t2613>However, there is something very strange that she does not have any symptoms of anemia.</t2613> <t2614>I suggested she call her maid to ask a few questions, and then we will find the most accurate information possible.</t2614> <t2615>But in fact, I already know what this maid will answer.</t2615> <t2616>Anyway, there must be a cause leading to the pathological state, and there is always only one cause.</t2616> <t2617>I will return to Amsterdam to think further.</t2617> <t2618>Send me a telegram every day, and if necessary, I will come back here.</t2618> <t2619>I call it a disease because no matter what, it is still a disease that I cannot ignore, and even I cannot be indifferent to the charming girl.</t2619> <t2620>Yes, she is indeed very charming, lovely, and I would willingly come back just for her, even if you are not here and she is not ill.</t2620>
<t2621>Arthur, let me remind you that the professor did not want to talk more to me about that matter, even when it was just the two of us.</t2621> <t2622>Up until now, I only know as much as you do, because whatever I know, I have already told you.</t2622> <t2623>Please believe that I will always keep an eye on our dear patient.</t2623> <t2624>I hope your father's condition will improve.</t2624> <t2625>In your position, I would probably find it hard to stand firm: it is truly terrible to know that the two people closest to you are both in critical condition!</t2625> <t2626>I fully understand the feelings and duties of a son with a sick father, but if Lucy's condition worsens, I will still write to call you immediately.</t2626> <t2627>Therefore, if you do not hear from me, you should not worry too much.</t2627><t2628>"</t2628>
<t2629>Dr. Seward's Diary</t2629>
<t2630>• September 4</t2630>
<t2631>The more I observe my psychiatric patients, the more interesting I find it.</t2631> <t2632>Yesterday, he only had one episode.</t2632> <t2633>Near noon, he started to go berserk.</t2633> <t2634>Recognizing his familiar symptoms, the warden immediately called for assistance.</t2634> <t2635>Fortunately, everyone arrived in time; otherwise, we would have had a hard time restraining someone in such a terrible fit of madness like his.</t2635> <t2636>But only about five minutes later, he calmed down and, of course, fell into a prolonged state of melancholy again.</t2636> <t2637>The warden informed me that just before his episode, he had uttered some terrifying screams.</t2637> <t2638>This did not surprise me, as I had grown accustomed to the long, mournful cries in the wild states of some other patients.</t2638> <t2639>As I write these lines, it is dinner time for the inpatients, yet Renfield is still sitting with his knees hugged in a corner of the room, his face sorrowful with his own thoughts.</t2639> <t2640>I do not think much about his state of mind.</t2640>
<t2641>• A moment later</t2641>
<t2642>There was a change in the person of my patient.</t2642> <t2643>I went back to visit him at 5 o'clock, and it seemed he was very content with his fate.</t2643> <t2644>He caught flies and put them in his mouth, chewing voraciously, and each time he caught one, he would mark a line on the door with his fingernail.</t2644> <t2645>As soon as he saw me, he hurriedly apologized for his improper behavior and then requested, or rather begged, me to allow him to return to his room, where he could continue his work of recording in his notebook.</t2645> <t2646>I thought I had to make him abandon this erratic temperament, so I agreed to his request.</t2646> <t2647>He returned to his room and immediately opened the window, then he took a pinch of sugar and sprinkled it on the outer window ledge to catch flies.</t2647> <t2648>But this time he caught flies not to put them in his mouth, but to put them in a box as he had done before, and then he went to check all the corners of the room to look for a spider.</t2648> <t2649>I tried to probe him to see what he thought about the past days, because even a minimal thread in his thoughts would help me a lot in my work.</t2649> <t2650>But indeed, there was no way to draw him out of his silence at this moment.</t2650> <t2651>After a while, his sullen face suddenly showed a hint of sadness, and only then did he whisper in a barely audible voice, making me feel as if he was talking to himself rather than to me:</t2651>
<t2652>— So that's it? Is it really over?</t2652> <t2653>He has abandoned me! Now I have nothing left to hope for.</t2653> <t2654>So I have to act on my own again.</t2654>
<t2655>Then he suddenly turned to look at me, his voice becoming more resolute:</t2655>
<t2656>— Doctor, would you like to show some kindness towards me? Please have someone bring me a little more sugar.</t2656> <t2657>I believe that will make me feel much better.</t2657>
<t2658>— What about the flies?</t2658>
<t2659>— Of course, flies also love sugar, and I, on the other hand, love flies very much: that's the reason why I like the sweetness of sugar.</t2659>
<t2660>Yet, there are quite a few foolish people who believe that madmen cannot connect many ideas together in a truly satisfying way!</t2660>
<t2661>Indeed, he became noticeably happier when I had someone bring him a little more sugar.</t2661>
<t2662>• Midnight</t2662>
<t2663>Another change in Renfield's behavior. I had just returned from Lucy's house (her condition has improved) and stopped at the threshold of the asylum, intending to sit for a while to watch the sunset, when I was startled by a scream.</t2663> <t2664>It was him again. I felt a bit uneasy and saddened that I could no longer leisurely admire the wondrous sky at sunset casting its golden haze over London, but had to turn back to face the dismal stone walls of the asylum, which cast a hopeless shadow over a wretched soul.</t2664> <t2665>I stepped into Renfield's room as the sun was gradually setting outside the window.</t2665> <t2666>The patient's madness had subsided for a few minutes, but just as the sun disappeared, he suddenly slipped from the grasp of the person holding him and collapsed to the floor like a felled tree.</t2666> <t2667>It was truly surprising to see patients suddenly regain their sanity, even if only fleetingly, for after a few minutes, he stood up again and looked around with a very calm demeanor.</t2667> <t2668>I signaled to the attendants to let him act as he wished, because I was very curious to see what would happen.</t2668>
<t2669>He quickly walked towards the window and swept all the sugar grains off the ledge onto the ground, then he opened the lid of the fly box to let them all fly out before tossing the lid away.</t2669> <t2670>Finally, he slammed the window shut and plopped down on the bed.</t2670>
<t2671>— So you don't need those flies anymore? - I asked.</t2671>
<t2672>— No need, - He replied - I am fed up with those useless bugs!</t2672>
<t2673>To be honest, I can't understand the reason behind his changes! Please pay attention, everyone! We might find the real cause if we know why his madness reached its peak exactly at noon and then again at sunset today.</t2673> <t2674>Should we consider that at certain times, the sun has a malign influence on some living creatures, just as the moon sometimes has a negative impact on other entities?</t2674>
<t2675>Then we will see...</t2675>

<t2686>Letter from Dr. Seward to Arthur Holmwood</t2686>
<t2687>“September 6</t2687>
<t2688>Dear friend Arthur,</t2688>
<t2689>The news I am sending you today is no longer good; Lucy's health condition has worsened.</t2689> <t2690>This deterioration is an outcome I dared not hope for.</t2690> <t2691>Mrs. Westenra asked me what I thought about Lucy's current state, and I took the opportunity to tell her that my old friend, Professor Van Helsing, had just come to visit me for a few days, and I could ask the professor to examine and treat her daughter.</t2691> <t2692>The issue now is that if necessary, we must frequently visit this kind-hearted woman without making her too worried or causing her too much emotion, which could make her collapse.</t2692> <t2693>We must also avoid making her aware of Lucy's situation at all costs, as it would be a painful shock that nothing could compensate for.</t2693> <t2694>My dear friend, we are facing seemingly insurmountable difficulties.</t2694> <t2695>However, with the grace of God, we hope to remain steadfast.</t2695> <t2696>Whenever necessary, I will update you further.</t2696> <t2697>Therefore, if you do not hear anything more from me, do not be anxious; it simply means that there are no new developments to report.</t2697> <t2698>I am in a hurry.</t2698>
<t2699>Wishing good health to Mr. John Seward</t2699>
<t2700>Dr. Seward's Diary</t2700>
<t2701>• September 7</t2701>
<t2702>When we met on Liverpool Street, the first thing Helsing asked me was:</t2702>
<t2703>— Have you informed our young friend, that fiancé of hers, yet?</t2703>
<t2704>— Not yet, Professor, - I replied - as I mentioned in the telegram, I must meet with you first.</t2704> <t2705>I sent him a letter, but it only briefly stated that the professor was planning to return to examine Lucy once more, and that I would inform him as soon as there was any news.</t2705>
<t2706>— Good, my friend, very good!</t2706> <t2707>It's best not to let him know, because at this moment he might never find out the truth, I hope so!</t2707> <t2708>But if it is really necessary, I will tell him everything.</t2708> <t2709>My friend, please understand me.</t2709> <t2710>More than anyone else, as a specialist in caring for mental patients, you should be someone who understands me very well.</t2710> <t2711>In one way or another, we are all madmen, and in the case where you show a lack of caution when caring for your mental patients, you would be acting no differently than the mad sheep of God. Do not tell your patients why you have to care for them, nor should you tell them what you are thinking.</t2711> <t2712>In situations that make us hesitate, he should keep what he knows to himself until his belief is more firmly established.</t2712> <t2713>Yes, let us keep what we know to ourselves, like this and like that... for now...</t2713> <t2714>(Saying this, he placed his hand on his chest, then on my forehead, then moved his finger back to his chest, and then to his forehead).</t2714> <t2715>As for myself, I have understood a few issues and will gradually reveal them to you later.</t2715>
<t2716>— Why not say it now? - I asked. - Who knows, it might be useful for us, it could help us make a decision.</t2716>
<t2717>The professor waved his hand and looked straight into my eyes as if he wanted me to be silent:</t2717>
<t2718>— My friend, when the wheat plant emerges from the ground but has not yet reached maturity, the milk of the mother earth still flows within its body. However, before the sun has yet to spread its radiant golden rays, the plowman hastily picks a stalk, crushes it in his rough hand, and blows away the still-green grain, saying to you: "Just look at this! The grain is truly plump."</t2718> <t2719>It is promising a bountiful harvest!”</t2719>
<t2720>To be honest, I still haven't grasped the connection between the professor's metaphorical story and what we are discussing.</t2720>
<t2721>Van Helsing did not reply but pinched my ear hard and pulled it to one side just as he used to do when I was his student.</t2721> <t2722>Finally, he explained:</t2722>
<t2723>— The kind-hearted farmer said this because at that moment he was certain of a good harvest, but before seeing the wheat ears, he did not dare to boast.</t2723> <t2724>There would never be a case where a farmer would uproot the wheat he had spent so much effort sowing and tending to just to see how it had grown.</t2724> <t2725>Only carefree children would act like that, but those who sow seeds to make a living would never do so.</t2725> <t2726>Now, do you understand my point, my friend?</t2726> <t2727>I sow the wheat seeds, and nature must make them sprout.</t2727> <t2728>And if the seeds sprout, then what I await will be plump, full grains.</t2728>
<t2729>Van Helsing's expression suddenly became pensive and hard to understand.</t2729> <t2730>After a moment of silence, he continued the story, his tone serious, quite different from before:</t2730>
<t2731>— You were once one of the most outstanding students that I cherished.</t2731> <t2732>At that time, you were just a student, but now, you are a teacher, and I believe that you still maintain the passionate research habits of the past.</t2732> <t2733>My friend, remember that knowledge is always more important than memories, that we should not blindly pride ourselves on the basic concepts we have achieved.</t2733> <t2734>If you have abandoned those valuable habitual practices, now is the time to restore them.</t2734> <t2735>Let me tell you that the case of that young friend could - pay attention, I said could - become a practical benefit for us and for others as well.</t2735> <t2736>Do not be negligent in any way.</t2736> <t2737>Here is a piece of advice for you: remember all your doubts, your hypotheses about phenomena, even the smallest detail.</t2737> <t2738>It will certainly be very useful for verifying the accuracy of your later judgments.</t2738> <t2739>It is not success, but failure that brings us lessons!</t2739>
<t2740>Listening to me describe the symptoms I had observed in Lucy, although he listened attentively, the professor still did not make any comments.</t2740> <t2741>He quietly picked up the medical and medicine kit.</t2741> <t2742>"A whole bunch of cumbersome tools necessary for our delightful professional work." - he had once said to us, his students, in a lecture about all the most basic tools a doctor needs to practice.</t2742>
<t2743>Mrs. Westenra came out to greet us.</t2743> <t2744>She did not have the worried look that I had feared.</t2744> <t2745>The nature of nature has the good quality of always providing a remedy for the most terrible obsessions, even if death is lurking somewhere.</t2745> <t2746>Mrs. Westenra had donned an emotional armor against all harm, even when she sensed the changes in her daughter that I found frightening.</t2746>
<t2747>If this can be called a self-liberating selfishness, then we should not be quick to condemn those whom we see as selfish, because the reasons leading to that character trait are sometimes much more mysterious than what people usually think.</t2747>
<t2748>However, my understanding of the core of psychiatric pathology compelled me to adhere to a very clear course of action: I decided never to allow Mrs. Westenra to be present when we examined Lucy, and she should not be concerned about her daughter's health unless it was absolutely necessary.</t2748> <t2749>Lucy's mother tried to appear cheerful when accepting my suggestion.</t2749>
<t2750>A maid led us, that is Van Helsing and me, into Lucy's room. If yesterday, looking at her, I only felt a slight concern, then today I was truly shocked by the change that had taken place in her: before me was a gaunt, sallow Lucy; her face was pale, her lips were colorless, and her gums seemed to have no blood circulating inside.</t2750> <t2751>Listening to her breathing at this moment was truly a torment: she was struggling to breathe to the point that it seemed she could not endure it much longer.</t2751>
<t2752>Van Helsing's complexion seemed unchanged; he was deep in thought about something.</t2752> <t2753>Lucy lay still, she didn't even have the strength to greet us anymore.</t2753> <t2754>The three of us quietly looked at each other for a long time. Then Van Helsing slightly nodded to signal me, and we quietly left the room.</t2754>
<t2755>The door hadn't fully closed yet when he pulled me, dragging me to the next room, and said:</t2755>
<t2756>— My God! It's really terrible?</t2756> <t2757>We can't afford to waste another minute.</t2757> <t2758>Lucy will die from blood loss.</t2758> <t2759>She doesn't even have enough blood left for her heart to function.</t2759> <t2760>We need to perform a blood transfusion immediately.</t2760> <t2761>Which one of us two?</t2761>
<t2762>— I am younger and healthier, professor.</t2762> <t2763>So let me donate blood.</t2763>
<t2764>— Then we must proceed immediately!</t2764> <t2765>You get ready! I need to go get the tool bag.</t2765>
<t2766>We were both going down the stairs when we heard a knock on the door.</t2766> <t2767>The housekeeper ran to open the door, and it turned out to be Arthur.</t2767> <t2768>He hurried towards me, his voice trembling with worry:</t2768>
<t2769>— Jack, I'm so worried.</t2769> <t2770>I have read your letter over and over, you can't know how much I've had to endure since then.</t2770> <t2771>Seeing that my old man's health has stabilized, I decided I had to come here immediately to see what's going on.</t2771> <t2772>That's Dr. Van Helsing, right?</t2772> <t2773>Very grateful for your presence!</t2773>
<t2774>Seeing the newcomer, the professor seemed displeased; he was annoyed because his work was interrupted at a critical moment. But after a while, when he understood Arthur's courageous approach to the situation, his eyes lit up, he extended his hand and said:</t2774>
<t2775>— You arrived just in time.</t2775> <t2776>You must be the fiancé of that young lady?</t2776> <t2777>She is very ill, gravely ill.</t2777> <t2778>But stay calm, young man, don't let yourself collapse at this moment. (Because, Arthur now looks very haggard, his face pale, he slumped into the chair as if about to faint) On the contrary, you must be even more courageous.</t2778> <t2779>You will have to help her.</t2779> <t2780>You can help her more than anyone else in this world, and to be precise, you can help her best with your own courage.</t2780>
<t2781>— So what can I possibly do? - Arthur asked again in a very weak voice.</t2781> <t2782>- Please, professor, just say it, I will not hesitate.</t2782> <t2783>My life belongs to her, I must save her until the last drop of blood.</t2783>
<t2784>— Young man. - Van Helsing replied, humorously - I don't demand that much from you: you don't need to sacrifice your last drop of blood?</t2784>
<t2785>— So what should I do?</t2785>
<t2786>In Arthur's eyes, there seemed to be fire, and both his nostrils flared with impatience.</t2786> <t2787>Van Helsing gently patted his shoulder:</t2787>
<t2788>— Come here.</t2788> <t2789>We really need a man like you.</t2789> <t2790>You will be more suitable than me, much more than our friend John in this matter.</t2790>
<t2791>It is clear that Arthur still did not understand what the professor meant, so he had to gently explain further:</t2791>
<t2792>— It is true that the young girl is very seriously ill.</t2792> <t2793>One could say that there is hardly any blood left in her body; if we do not transfuse blood, she will certainly not survive.</t2793> <t2794>John and I have agreed to perform what we call a blood transfusion, which means taking blood from full veins and letting it flow into nearly empty veins in an emergency situation! And John will be the blood donor, as he is younger and healthier than I am.</t2794> <t2795>But now, since you are here, you are the healthiest among the three of us; age is no longer an important factor because both of us have been working too hard, and thus our blood is no longer as rich as the blood flowing in your veins!</t2795>
<t2796>Arthur turned to Van Helsing and said:</t2796>
<t2797>— If only you could know how much I am yearning to sacrifice my life for hers, then perhaps you would understand...</t2797>
<t2798>He suddenly choked up and couldn't speak anymore.</t2798>
<t2799>— Bravo, my friend! - Van Helsing exclaimed. - Now, come with us, but remember to stay quiet.</t2799> <t2800>You can kiss your beloved once before the blood transfusion, but once the work begins, leave it to us.</t2800> <t2801>When I signal, you must leave the room immediately.</t2801> <t2802>And don't say anything to Mrs. Westenra!</t2802> <t2803>We need to preserve her strength.</t2803> <t2804>Come here!</t2804>
<t2805>All three of us walked up the stairs together.</t2805> <t2806>But Professor Van Helsing did not want Arthur to enter the room at the same time as us.</t2806> <t2807>He had to wait on the landing.</t2807> <t2808>Seeing us, Lucy turned her face but said nothing.</t2808> <t2809>She wasn't sleeping but just lying still because she was too weak.</t2809> <t2810>Trying to speak was impossible for her at that moment.</t2810> <t2811>Speaking with her eyes was all she could do in front of us.</t2811>
<t2812>Van Helsing opened his bag, took out some items, and placed them on the table, out of the patient's sight.</t2812> <t2813>He prepared a dose of anesthetic and then returned to Lucy's bed:</t2813>
<t2814>— Come on, little girl, take this medicine! Try to drink this whole cup like a good child.</t2814> <t2815>Pay attention, I'll hold the cup for you, that way it will be easier. There...</t2815> <t2816>Good!</t2816>
<t2817>I was very surprised to see how quickly the sleeping pill took effect, which showed how weak the girl was.</t2817> <t2818>It seemed that in her eyes, as she began to close her eyelids, there was an eternal, endless world.</t2818> <t2819>Immediately after the sleeping pill took effect, Van Heising called Arthur into the room and told him to take off his vest.</t2819>
<t2820>— Now, - He said - you can hold her as I instructed.</t2820> <t2821>In the meantime, I will set up a table near the patient's bed.</t2821> <t2822>John, my friend, give me a hand!</t2822>
<t2823>Due to being busy preparing the equipment, we didn't notice Arthur fussing over Lucy.</t2823>
<t2824>Van Helsing whispered into my ear:</t2824>
<t2825>— He is still young and very healthy, I believe we won't need to remove the blood clot.</t2825>
<t2826>And then, with a few quick, precise, and methodical movements, he began the blood transfusion.</t2826>
<t2827>Life seemed to be gradually bringing a rosy hue back to Lucy's cheeks, while Arthur's face quickly turned pale, yet his eyes still shone with indescribable joy.</t2827> <t2828>Looking at my friend, I couldn't help but feel a pang of sadness.</t2828> <t2829>I feared that someone like him would find it difficult to recover after losing so much blood.</t2829>
<t2830>The professor's face was very serious and tense.</t2830> <t2831>Holding the watch in his hand, he kept looking at the patient and then at Arthur.</t2831> <t2832>I was so nervous that I could hear every beat of my heart.</t2832> <t2833>Van Helsing suddenly told me:</t2833>
<t2834>— That's enough.</t2834> <t2835>Now you have to keep an eye on him, and I'll take care of the patient.</t2835>
<t2836>Arthur visibly weakened.</t2836> <t2837>I only dared to acknowledge this reality after the work was done.</t2837> <t2838>I was preparing to take Arthur outside after bandaging his wound when I heard Van Helsing's voice. He spoke without turning around, giving me the impression that he had eyes in the back of his head.</t2838>
<t2839>— I think this brave fiancé deserves a kiss.</t2839> <t2840>You can do it right now.</t2840> <t2841>As he spoke, he slipped a pillow under the patient's head.</t2841>
<t2842>But when Lucy made the first slight movement after receiving the blood transfusion, the black velvet band she always wore around her neck suddenly moved up, revealing a red mark.</t2842> <t2843>It seemed that Arthur didn't notice, but Van Helsing did, because I clearly heard his sharp and sudden intake of breath.</t2843> <t2844>Whenever he is emotional and surprised by something, I always see him react like that.</t2844>
<t2845>He still pretended not to notice anything and turned to tell me:</t2845>
<t2846>— Okay, go down with this brave friend of yours, give him a glass of Porto wine and let him rest for a while.</t2846><t2847>After that, he will go home to rest, sleep well, and eat as much as possible to make up for what he just did for his fiancée.</t2847><t2848>Don't stay here too long! Wait, there's one more thing! My friend, I believe you would want to know the result of what we just did.</t2848><t2849>Rest assured! The operation was a complete success.</t2849><t2850>You have saved the young lady, and now you can go home without any worries.</t2850><t2851>You have done everything you could for her.</t2851><t2852>I will talk to her when she has recovered.</t2852><t2853>Surely she will love you more.</t2853><t2854>Goodbye.</t2854>
<t2855>When Arthur had left the house, I returned to meet Van Helsing.</t2855> <t2856>Lucy was still asleep, but her breathing seemed much more gentle.</t2856> <t2857>The professor was attentively watching her.</t2857> <t2858>The black velvet ribbon had been adjusted back to its position, covering the red mark on her neck. I softly asked the professor:</t2858>
<t2859>— How does the professor explain that wound?</t2859>
<t2860>— So what about you, how do you explain it?</t2860>
<t2861>— I still haven't examined that wound carefully, let me remove the bandage and take a look.</t2861>
<t2862>Indeed, on the outside of the jugular vein on the girl's neck, there were still two small marks like two unhealed punctures.</t2862> <t2863>It was certainly not a symptom of any pathology, but the edges of the wounds were pale white with frayed edges as if they had been there for a long time.</t2863> <t2864>I immediately thought that this wound, if it could be called a wound, might suggest a cause of severe blood loss for the girl, but I had to quickly dismiss this nascent thought because I found it utterly absurd. If one saw Lucy's pallor, as if she were about to die before the blood transfusion, her bed would surely be soaked with the blood she had lost.</t2864>
<t2865>— So? - Van Helsing asked me.</t2865>
<t2866>— Strange?</t2866> <t2867>I don't understand anything.</t2867>
<t2868>— Tonight I must return to Amsterdam at all costs. - The professor said as he stood up.</t2868> <t2869>- I need to look up some more books and documents.</t2869> <t2870>You stay here all night with the patient, okay!</t2870>
<t2871>— Do I need to call another nurse?</t2871>
<t2872>— You and I, we will be the best nurses.</t2872> <t2873>You will have to pay attention to her diet, and especially make sure she is not disturbed.</t2873> <t2874>Remember not to fall asleep, okay?</t2874> <t2875>Both you and I will catch up on sleep later.</t2875> <t2876>I will try to come back here as soon as possible, and then we can start.</t2876>
<t2877>— Can we start? What was the professor going to say?</t2877>
<t2878>— Then you will see? - Van Helsing said as he hurriedly walked away.</t2878>
<t2879>But after a moment, I saw him open the door, stick his head in, and raise his index finger to tell me:</t2879>
<t2880>— Don't forget: I have great trust in you.</t2880> <t2881>If you carelessly leave this room and something unfortunate happens, you will surely have to spend many more sleepless nights!</t2881>
<t2882>• September 18</t2882>
<t2883>I stayed up all night and, of course, didn't dare leave the patient's room for a minute.</t2883> <t2884>As night fell, the effect of the sleeping pills wore off, and Lucy woke up completely naturally.</t2884> <t2885>She was a completely different young girl from the one we had met before the blood transfusion. There was even a sparkle of joy and liveliness in her eyes, although the signs of deep fatigue were still there.</t2885> <t2886>When I told Mrs. Westenra that Dr. Van Helsing had instructed me to stay up all night to watch over her daughter, she expressed reluctance to accept this suggestion, reasoning that her daughter had fully recovered.</t2886> <t2887>However, I did not relent and continued to prepare myself to stay awake all night by Lucy's bedside. After the maid finished her personal hygiene and I hurriedly ate dinner, I returned to sit by her bed.</t2887> <t2888>There was no one else in the room.</t2888> <t2889>Every time we looked at each other, I could read gratitude in her eyes.</t2889> <t2890>I had the feeling that she was gradually falling asleep, but at the same time, I sensed that she was resisting that sleep.</t2890> <t2891>She kept trying like that, and each attempt was more strenuous than the last.</t2891> <t2892>It was clear that she didn't want to sleep, so I had to ask her why.</t2892>
<t2893>— I'm really scared of sleeping. - She confessed.</t2893>
<t2894>— Afraid of sleeping! Yet, all of us consider sleep as one of the most valuable treasures!</t2894>
<t2895>— Oh! Surely you wouldn't say that if you were in my position...</t2895> <t2896>if in your sleep you only encountered terrifying nightmares.</t2896>
<t2897>— Nightmares?</t2897> <t2898>Good heavens, what are you trying to say?</t2898>
<t2899>— I don't know, I don't know...</t2899> <t2900>And it's precisely that not knowing that makes me even more scared! Just thinking about sleep makes me shudder?</t2900>
<t2901>— But little girl, tonight you can sleep peacefully without any fear.</t2901> <t2902>I promise that I will be near you, everything will be fine.</t2902>
<t2903>— Oh! I trust you, I always trust you!</t2903>
<t2904>— Yes, I promise that if I notice any sign that you are having a nightmare, I will wake you up immediately.</t2904>
<t2905>— Waking me up?</t2905> <t2906>Are you serious? Oh! You are so kind to me.</t2906> <t2907>If that's the case, then I will sleep...</t2907>
<t2908>Speaking up to this point, Lucy let out a long, relieved sigh and then immediately fell asleep.</t2908>
<t2909>I stayed up watching her all night.</t2909> <t2910>She just lay there in a deep, peaceful sleep without stirring even once.</t2910> <t2911>Her lips slightly parted with a happy smile lingering on her face, her chest rising and falling with steady breaths like the pendulum of a clock.</t2911> <t2912>Clearly, no terrible dreams disturbed the tranquility of her mind.</t2912>
<t2913>The maid came to knock on the door very early; I entrusted her with the task of continuing to take care of the girl, then hurried back to the clinic to handle some matters.</t2913>
<t2914>I sent a telegram to Van Helsing and Arthur to inform them of the wonderful results of the blood transfusion.</t2914> <t2915>By the time I finished dealing with personal matters, the day was almost over.</t2915> <t2916>I suddenly remembered Renfield and wanted to know news about him.</t2916> <t2917>All good news.</t2917> <t2918>He has been calm since last night.</t2918> <t2919>I received a telegram from Van Helsing while I was having dinner; he suggested I return to Hillingham tonight, as he thought it might be a useful thing to do.</t2919> <t2920>He informed me that he would return to Hillingham tomorrow morning.</t2920>
<t2921>• September 9</t2921>
<t2922>I felt very tired when I arrived at Hillingham.</t2922>
<t2923>After two sleepless nights, my strength had significantly diminished.</t2923> <t2924>On the contrary, Lucy was able to stand up, and her temperament was more stable.</t2924>
<t2925>Holding my hands tightly, looking straight into my eyes, she spoke in an emotional voice:</t2925>
<t2926>— You don't need to stay up tonight.</t2926> <t2927>I assure you that I have completely recovered!</t2927> <t2928>If anyone needs to stay up, it should be me; I should stay up so you can sleep, right?</t2928>
<t2929>I don't want to go against your words.</t2929> <t2930>We sat down to have dinner together, and being able to dine with you was truly a pleasant experience for me.</t2930> <t2931>I drank two glasses of fine Portuguese wine before going upstairs with Lucy.</t2931> <t2932>She showed me a room with a flickering fire next to her room.</t2932>
<t2933>— There, you will rest there. I will leave both doors of the two rooms open.</t2933> <t2934>You will lie on the couch.</t2934> <t2935>I know that according to ethics, no doctor would want to lie on a bed when there is a patient.</t2935> <t2936>Rest assured, if anything is needed, I will call you immediately.</t2936>
<t2937>I could only follow Lucy's advice, as honestly, I felt I no longer had the strength to stay awake.</t2937> <t2938>Anyway, she had promised me once again that she would call me if needed!</t2938> <t2939>Thinking so, I lay down on the couch with peace of mind and fell into a deep sleep just a few minutes later.</t2939>
<t2940>Lucy Westenra's Diary</t2940>
<t2941>• September 9</t2941>
<t2942>It was indeed a pleasant night! The confident footsteps wandering around the house gave me a feeling as if I were strolling under the bright sunshine after a windy winter season beneath a gloomy gray sky.</t2942> <t2943>I suddenly felt that Arthur seemed to be very close to me, closer than usual, without understanding why.</t2943>
<t2944>Even I could feel the warm, passionate heat emanating from him.</t2944> <t2945>There is no doubt anymore, it is my illness and weakness that have brought him closer to me.</t2945> <t2946>If only Arthur knew what I am thinking about him at this moment? Thank God for giving me a peaceful sleep last night?</t2946> <t2947>The presence of Dr. Seward ensured my good sleep! And tonight I will not fear sleeping either, because the doctor is still here, if needed, I just need to call out once.</t2947> <t2948>Everyone is so good to me! Thank God! Arthur, good night!</t2948>
<t2949>Dr. Seward's Diary</t2949>
<t2950>• September 10</t2950>
<t2951>I felt someone just put their hand on my head, and I immediately thought it was the professor's hand and opened my eyes at once.</t2951> <t2952>In the hospital, we were used to this kind of startling awakening.</t2952>
<t2953>— So, how is our patient doing?</t2953>
<t2954>— It's very good that I left her place.</t2954>
<t2955>— Good.</t2955> <t2956>Go visit her!</t2956>
<t2957>We both turned towards Lucy's room.</t2957>
<t2958>The curtain of her room's window had been lowered for some time; and to raise it, I had to tiptoe towards the window to find the pull cord.</t2958> <t2959>Meanwhile, the professor also very gently stepped towards Lucy's bed.</t2959>
<t2960>When the curtain was drawn up, the morning light immediately flooded into the small room.</t2960> <t2961>I was suddenly startled when I heard the professor's astonished hiss, my heart instantly tightened.</t2961> <t2962>I was paralyzed when I heard the professor's muffled cry as he turned back.</t2962> <t2963>His terrified cry, "Heavens, Earth!" was enough for me to immediately understand the actual situation, even though I hadn't yet seen the evident pain and suffering on his face.</t2963> <t2964>He shakily pointed to the bed.</t2964> <t2965>I felt my knees about to give way.</t2965>
<t2966>On the bed, Lucy was lying as if unconscious, her skin pale gray like a corpse, looking weaker than ever.</t2966> <t2967>Her lips had turned back to a pale white, her teeth bared as if her gums were gone - a sight we often see in someone who has died after a long illness.</t2967> <t2968>Van Helsing seemed very angry, he was about to stomp his foot on the floor but then slowly lowered it.</t2968>
<t2969>After a moment of anxious bewilderment, he gently told me, his voice resolute:</t2969>
<t2970>— It's not too late yet.</t2970> <t2971>Her heart is still beating, though very weak.</t2971> <t2972>But we must get to work immediately.</t2972> <t2973>Now that Arthur is no longer here, I need to rely on your generosity, my friend John</t2973><t2974>!</t2974>
<t2975>The professor spoke while pulling out some tools needed for the blood transfusion from his bag; I hurriedly took off my jacket and rolled up my shirt sleeve as high as possible.</t2975> <t2976>We quickly got to work.</t2976> <t2977>After a few minutes that seemed to stretch into eternity - it was truly grueling to feel the blood flowing out of your veins, even when you are a volunteer.</t2977> <t2978>Van Helsing raised his finger to warn me:</t2978>
<t2979>— Don't move anymore, you must be patient...</t2979> <t2980>But I'm afraid that when her strength returns, she will wake up, and that would be very dangerous.</t2980> <t2981>We need to be cautious.</t2981> <t2982>Perhaps I should give her another dose of morphine.</t2982>
<t2983>The dose of morphine quickly took effect, as we saw our patient seemingly transition gradually from a state of coma to a natural sleep.</t2983> <t2984>Honestly, I felt a surge of pride when I saw her cheeks and then her lips begin to regain their rosy color.</t2984>
<t2985>Professor Van Helsing is still observing me.</t2985>
<t2986>— Perhaps that's enough.</t2986> <t2987>- He said.</t2987>
<t2988>— Enough? - I asked in surprise. - The other day, when Arthur donated blood, you left it for so long?</t2988>
<t2989>He suddenly burst into laughter, a laugh that had something somewhat sad about it, then replied to me:</t2989>
<t2990>— Arthur is the fiancé of the girl.</t2990> <t2991>As for you, you still have a lot of work to do; your duty is not only to take care of her alone, but also many other patients. That's enough for now.</t2991>
<t2992>After speaking, he turned to take care of Lucy, while I had to take care of my own necessary first steps after the blood transfusion.</t2992> <t2993>I stayed lying down for a bit longer, because to be honest, I felt a bit dizzy and quite weak.</t2993> <t2994>The professor bandaged my puncture wound and advised me to go downstairs and drink a glass of wine to regain my strength.</t2994> <t2995>As I opened the door to leave the room, he followed and whispered in my ear:</t2995>
<t2996>— Don't say anything to anyone, okay! If your friend Arthur happens to come here, just act as if nothing happened.</t2996> <t2997>Because it could both make him worried and make him jealous, we should avoid it at all costs! Now, shall we go down?</t2997>
<t2998>A moment later, when we met again, he looked at me very attentively.</t2998>
<t2999>— Now, - he told me - you should lie down and rest for a while, maybe one or two hours, on the couch in the other room!</t2999> <t3000>Then after having a full lunch...</t3000> <t3001>Yes, you need to eat a lot and then come back here to find me!</t3001>
<t3002>I obeyed him because I knew that he was right, that his advice was always sound.</t3002> <t3003>I did what I needed to do, and now recovering my strength is also a task I cannot shirk.</t3003>
<t3004>Exhaustion did not prevent me from being surprised by what had happened.</t3004> <t3005>Lying on the couch, I kept wondering what could have caused Lucy to become so emaciated and exhausted. Why did she lose blood? Why was there no trace of anything in her room or anywhere else? Surely, whether asleep or awake, these questions kept lingering in my mind, as I knew my thoughts were always haunted by the two small wounds on Lucy's neck, two wounds with torn edges and nothing tangible within them.</t3005>
<t3006>Our patient woke up a bit late, she looked much better, but still incomparable to her appearance last night.</t3006> <t3007>However, just seeing her like that was enough to comfort us.</t3007> <t3008>After examining her, Van Helsing went out to get some fresh air.</t3008> <t3009>Before leaving the room, he reminded me not to leave her alone, even for a minute.</t3009> <t3010>I also heard him asking someone downstairs about the nearest telegraph office.</t3010>
<t3011>Lucy innocently continued to chat with me at length, as if she was completely unaware of what had just happened.</t3011> <t3012>I tried to make her happy, engaging her in one story after another.</t3012> <t3013>And when her mother came to visit, I believed that she also did not notice any change in her.</t3013>
<t3014>— We really don't know what to do to thank you for all that you and your student have done for us? - She said to me with a voice full of deep gratitude.</t3014> <t3015>- But now, you should also take care of yourself a bit, don't let yourself become so exhausted.</t3015> <t3016>You look so pale today! Maybe you should get married, your wife will take care of you, will be devoted to you, in my opinion, that's what you should do at this moment!</t3016>
<t3017>Lucy suddenly blushed, the poor blood vessels in her body no longer had enough blood to supply her brain.</t3017> <t3018>After a while, her face gradually turned a pale gray, and she looked at me pleadingly.</t3018> <t3019>I smiled, nodded, and put my finger to my lips to signal her.</t3019> <t3020>She sighed and let herself fall back onto the pillow.</t3020>
<t3021>Two hours later, Van Helsing returned.</t3021> <t3022>As soon as he saw me, he immediately said:</t3022>
<t3023>— Go home, and remember to eat a lot to regain your strength.</t3023> <t3024>Tonight, I will stay here with the little girl.</t3024> <t3025>You and I will have to study this case together, but don't let anyone know what we're doing.</t3025> <t3026>I have thought of some very serious reasons, but I won't tell you about them at this moment.</t3026> <t3027>Just keep thinking what you are thinking, and don't be afraid to think about things you believe are unthinkable.</t3027> <t3028>Good night?</t3028>
<t3029>Down the hallway, two servants came running to ask me if they - or at least one of them - could stay the night with Lucy.</t3029> <t3030>They pleaded with me to allow them to go to her room.</t3030> <t3031>And when I replied that Professor Van Helsing only wanted one of us to stay up and watch over the patient, they burst into tears and asked me to speak to that "foreign gentleman" on their behalf.</t3031> <t3032>Their gestures moved me so deeply that I couldn't express this: they might have done so because they saw I was too exhausted, or because they wanted to show their kindness and dedication to Lucy.</t3032>
<t3033>I returned to the psychiatric hospital just in time to have dinner before visiting my patients; everything is fine.</t3033> <t3034>And now, I am writing these diary lines while waiting for sleep.</t3034> <t3035>A quick and deep sleep is what I hope will happen.</t3035>
<t3036>• September 11</t3036>
<t3037>This afternoon, I returned to Hillingham.</t3037> <t3038>Lucy seemed much better, which made Van Helsing very pleased.</t3038> <t3039>Shortly after I arrived, someone brought a rather large package to the professor from abroad.</t3039> <t3040>He hurriedly but very gently opened the package and then turned to give Lucy a large bouquet of white flowers:</t3040>
<t3041>— For you, Lucy!</t3041>
<t3042>— For me? Oh! Doctor Van Helsing?</t3042>
<t3043>— That's right, dear girl, but it's not to decorate the room.</t3043> <t3044>It's all medicine. - Hearing that, Lucy wrinkled her nose. - But it's not for making tea or brewing with that awful taste that you have to fear.</t3044> <t3045>Don't make that face or Arthur will laugh at you, it looks bad… Oh! There, your pretty nose is back to normal!</t3045> <t3046>That's better! This is indeed medicine, but you don't need to ingest it.</t3046> <t3047>I will place some flowers on the window, and the rest will be made into a garland to hang around your neck so you can sleep peacefully.</t3047> <t3048>Yes, like these lotus flowers, they will help you forget everything.</t3048> <t3049>The fragrance of this flower is similar to the scent of the Léthé or Jouvence cosmetics that explorers found in Florida.</t3049>
<t3050>While the professor was lecturing, Lucy just sat quietly, gazing at the bouquet of flowers and then bringing it to her nose to smell.</t3050> <t3051>She suddenly burst out laughing and pushed the bouquet away, her laughter carrying a hint of dissatisfaction.</t3051>
<t3052>— Oh! Professor, you must be joking with me!</t3052> <t3053>Is this what you call a flower? It smells just like garlic to me.</t3053>
<t3054>I was a bit surprised to see Van Helsing stand up abruptly and frown as he responded to the girl:</t3054>
<t3055>— I have never mocked anyone, never! Everything I have done has been done with the utmost seriousness.</t3055> <t3056>And I want you not to go against my intentions, as well as the measures I want to use.</t3056> <t3057>Remember, if not for your own benefit, then for the benefit of those who love you dearly!</t3057>
<t3058>But seeing the clear fear on the girl's face, he was forced to lower his voice:</t3058>
<t3059>— Oh! My little girl, there's nothing to be afraid of! Everything I want to tell you is for your own good.</t3059> <t3060>All the flowers in this bouquet have properties that can heal you.</t3060> <t3061>Look here! I will personally place this bouquet in your room, and I will personally make a garland for you to wear around your neck.</t3061> <t3062>But, shh!</t3062> <t3063>Don't say anything to anyone, and don't answer any questions if they ask you about this.</t3063> <t3064>What you need to do is listen and stay silent.</t3064> <t3065>If you follow instructions, you will recover quickly and return to the arms of the one waiting for you sooner! Now, just rest easy!</t3065> <t3066>Come on, John, help me arrange these flowers in the room, they're all flowers I ordered from Harlem.</t3066> <t3067>My friend Vanderpool has been tending to them all year to get these greenhouse flowers.</t3067> <t3068>Yesterday, I sent a telegram asking him to send them here.</t3068>
<t3069>And the two of us busily arranged the flowers in Lucy's room.</t3069> <t3070>Everything the professor did was clearly very unusual and completely unfamiliar with existing knowledge.</t3070> <t3071>First, he carefully closed all the windows tightly so that no one could open them.</t3071> <t3072>Then, he took some flower branches and repeatedly brushed them over the window frames, as if he wanted any air, even the smallest draft, passing through the cracks to be infused with the garlic-like smell of the flowers.</t3072> <t3073>Finally, he did the same with the door frame.</t3073> <t3074>Of course, he did not forget to place a bouquet in the fireplace in the room.</t3074>
<t3075>I keep wondering why he does that and what his purpose is.</t3075>
<t3076>— Professor, - I said when I couldn't bear it any longer, even though I knew that everything the professor had done had a valid reason, but this time I truly didn't understand - Looking at what the professor was doing, I was convinced that the professor was preparing some kind of charm to ward off a malicious spirit intending to invade this room.</t3076>
<t3077>— Sounds good! Yes, that could be the case.</t3077> <t3078>- He calmly replied to me while his hands were busy weaving a garland.</t3078>
<t3079>We eagerly awaited Lucy to fall asleep, and when the maid came to tell us she had gone to bed, Van Helsing personally went to place the garland around her neck.</t3079>
<t3080>— Pay attention, okay? Remember to keep the garland very carefully and for any reason, even if you feel uncomfortable because the doors are closed, do not open them, understand!</t3080>
<t3081>— I promise you, professor.</t3081> <t3082>- Lucy replied - A thousand thanks for the kindness of both the professor and his student?</t3082> <t3083>Oh! What have I done to deserve such noble and precious friendships brought to me by God?</t3083>
<t3084>When we left the house, Van Helsing told me:</t3084>
<t3085>— Finally, tonight I can sleep peacefully. I can't believe how much I've been craving sleep!</t3085> <t3086>Two nights on the road, then a day of reading and research, all the worries upon returning here, and another sleepless night without a single moment of rest—it's enough!</t3086> <t3087>Wake me up early tomorrow morning, okay? We'll go visit our little friend who is feeling better thanks to my "magic" charm. Ha! Ha!</t3087>
<t3088>In the face of his seemingly unshakable belief, I suddenly recalled what had happened two nights before, which led me to endure a tremendous disappointment.</t3088> <t3089>I began to suspect the worst possible outcome but did not dare to confess it to him.</t3089>
<t3090>CHAPTER 11</t3090>
<t3091>Lucy Westenra's Diary</t3091>
<t3092>• September 12</t3092>
<t3093>Everyone around me is so kind to me!</t3093>
<t3094>I really appreciate that old doctor Van Helsing, but I just don't understand why he insists on placing such flowers.</t3094> <t3095>In fact, he scared me a bit; he seems somewhat domineering!</t3095> <t3096>However, he must have his reasons, because now I feel healthier and more relaxed.</t3096> <t3097>In the evening, I slept very well and no longer fear being alone.</t3097> <t3098>The sound of birds flapping against the window is no longer a problem for me.</t3098> <t3099>Oh! So I no longer have to think about trying to resist sleep like before!</t3099> <t3100>Goodbye to the hardship of nights fighting against sleepiness, goodbye to the fear of falling asleep with nightmares overwhelming me! How happy are those who fear no one, who never doubt anything, those who, once they lay down, fall into a peaceful sleep with sweet dreams! How happy!</t3100> <t3101>Tonight I will be like them, I will call sleep to come to me, I hope I will fall asleep right away! I didn't know that the smell of garlic could bring such comfort - on the contrary...</t3101> <t3102>Its softened scent...</t3102> <t3103>I feel myself drifting off.</t3103> <t3104>Good night everyone...</t3104>
<t3105>Dr. Seward's Diary</t3105>
<t3106>• September 13</t3106>
<t3107>When I arrived in Berkeley, I saw that Van Helsing had been waiting for me for some time.</t3107> <t3108>The car that the hotel had called for us was parked at the front door.</t3108> <t3109>As usual, he was carrying his bag of tools today.</t3109>
<t3110>We arrived at Hillingham around 8 o'clock. A bright autumn morning was welcoming us with its sunshine.</t3110> <t3111>The colorful foliage still shyly peeked out from the rows of trees, as if reluctant to fall before the cool early autumn breezes.</t3111>
<t3112>In the hallway, we met Mrs. Westenra.</t3112> <t3113>As usual, she was always up very early.</t3113> <t3114>She greeted us with a very cheerful voice:</t3114>
<t3115>— Surely you will be very pleased to know that Lucy's condition has improved a lot!</t3115> <t3116>I just peeked in through the door, she is still sleeping, I didn't dare go in for fear of waking her up.</t3116>
<t3117>The professor smiled, clearly he was very happy.</t3117> <t3118>After a while, he rubbed his hands and said:</t3118>
<t3119>— Hey! My diagnosis was correct! So the treatment method has brought results.</t3119>
<t3120>Mrs. Westenra also added:</t3120>
<t3121>— My daughter's health improvement is not solely due to your treatment, you know.</t3121> <t3122>If Lucy is in such good shape this morning, it's partly thanks to my efforts as well.</t3122>
<t3123>—</t3123> <t3124>What do you mean, ma'am?</t3124>
<t3125>— It's nothing! Last night, feeling worried, I went over to the girl's room.</t3125> <t3126>She was sleeping so soundly that I entered the room without her noticing.</t3126> <t3127>The room was lacking air.</t3127> <t3128>Who would ever seal up a room so tightly like that?</t3128> <t3129>And I don't understand where she got all those flowers with such a terrible smell.</t3129> <t3130>She even wrapped the flowers around her neck! It was unbearable! Seeing her pale condition, I thought keeping those flowers in the room wasn't good, so I removed them all before slightly opening the window for some air.</t3130> <t3131>I'm sure you will be very pleased with the girl's health condition.</t3131>
<t3132>Not finishing her sentence, she smiled and went to another room, where she usually had breakfast alone.</t3132> <t3133>While this poor woman was babbling about her achievements, I turned to observe the professor's attitude: his face grew increasingly pale.</t3133> <t3134>However, in front of the innocent landlady, he still managed to smile and hold the door for her to go back to the living room.</t3134> <t3135>But as soon as she was out of sight, he immediately pushed me into the dining room and slammed the door shut.</t3135>
<t3136>Indeed, this was the first time in my life that I saw Van Helsing showing signs of losing courage like that.</t3136> <t3137>He raised his hand to the sky as if to say that all his plans from now on would be in vain.</t3137> <t3138>Finally, he collapsed into a chair, covering his face with his hands and crying.</t3138> <t3139>Yes, he cried.</t3139> <t3140>His sobs seemed to come from a heart that was shattered and helpless.</t3140> <t3141>Then he raised his hand again as if to plead for justification before the world.</t3141>
<t3142>— Oh Lord! - He lamented in a sobbing voice - What have we done, what has that poor little girl done to deserve this fate?</t3142> <t3143>Could destiny be so cruel?</t3143> <t3144>That poor innocent mother, just because of her good intentions for her daughter, has inadvertently pushed the girl's soul and body into danger without knowing it.</t3144> <t3145>But we cannot tell the truth to that woman, because she is living in a half-dead state, and her death would also mean the death of her daughter.</t3145> <t3146>Oh! Why have we fallen into such a predicament, oh Lord?</t3146>
<t3147>But then he suddenly stood up and told me in a completely different tone:</t3147>
<t3148>— Come here, we must do something new!</t3148> <t3149>Even if it's a demon, or a whole pack of demons coming together against us, it doesn't matter.</t3149> <t3150>We will fight, we will defeat them all.</t3150>
<t3151>He quickly ran to the door to get the bag and then pulled me to run up to Lucy's room.</t3151>
<t3152>Just like the last time, I stepped out to draw the curtains while Van Helsing anxiously approached the girl's bed.</t3152> <t3153>But this time, he was no longer surprised to see a ghastly gray color on the patient's face.</t3153> <t3154>On his face, there was only a profound sadness mixed with immense pity for the girl.</t3154>
<t3155>— I will wait here! - He muttered, his voice hissing.</t3155>
<t3156>Without saying another word, he hurriedly ran out to lock the door in preparation for the third blood transfusion.</t3156> <t3157>Seeing his urgency, I instinctively took off my jacket.</t3157> <t3158>However, Van Helsing gestured for me to stop.</t3158>
<t3159>— No! - He said. - Today, you will be the one to operate, and I will be the one to donate blood.</t3159> <t3160>You look very exhausted.</t3160>
<t3161>As he spoke, he quickly took off his jacket before rolling up the sleeves of his shirt.</t3161>
<t3162>Again a blood transfusion, again a sedative injection, and once more Lucy's cheeks gradually turned rosy, her breathing became steady again in her lifeless chest.</t3162> <t3163>Her sleep at this moment was truly a natural sleep.</t3163> <t3164>And this time it was my turn to watch over her, while Van Helsing took the opportunity to rest and regain his strength.</t3164>
<t3165>In the subsequent conversation with Mrs. Westenra, the professor was forced to explain to her that she should never discard anything arranged in Lucy's room without consulting him, that the flowers placed in the room had a therapeutic effect, and that the treatment he was administering to Lucy included the absorption of the fragrance of these flowers.</t3165> <t3166>Afterwards, he stated that he wanted to personally observe the progress in the patient's condition, and he would stay two more nights by her bedside.</t3166>
<t3167>About two hours later, Lucy woke up, looking as fresh as a rose.</t3167> <t3168>In short, it seemed she didn't feel like she had just escaped a critical danger.</t3168>
<t3169>What illness is she suffering from? Having spent so much time with psychiatric patients, I suddenly startled myself by wondering if I might be insane.</t3169>
<t3170>Lucy Westenra's Diary</t3170>
<t3171>• September 17</t3171>
<t3172>Four peaceful days and nights - yes, four absolutely peaceful days and nights have passed!</t3172> <t3173>I feel strong enough to recognize myself.</t3173> <t3174>I even feel as if I have just gone through a long, very long nightmare only to wake up in a room filled with sunlight under the cool morning air.</t3174> <t3175>I suddenly remember, very vaguely, the dark, desperate memories in the midst of hardship, followed by long periods of oblivion.</t3175> <t3176>There is another feeling: I feel like I am rising to the surface of life, like a diver emerging from a suffocating abyss.</t3176> <t3177>Honestly, since Dr. Van Helsing came here, all the terrifying dreams have become things of the past for me.</t3177> <t3178>The sounds that used to frighten me - like the flapping of birds or animals against the window, or the voices from afar getting closer, and the calls that seemed to command me from nowhere - have not reappeared.</t3178> <t3179>Now I have also lost the fear of sleeping, so I no longer need to force myself to stay awake.</t3179> <t3180>And especially, those garlic-scented flowers have made me feel much more comfortable.</t3180> <t3181>Every day I receive a box of flowers sent from Harlem.</t3181> <t3182>Tonight, Dr. Van Helsing said goodbye to me; he has to go back to Amsterdam for a day.</t3182> <t3183>But the feeling of health and comfort has given me real confidence to stay in the room alone.</t3183> <t3184>I thank God when I think of my mother, my dear Arthur, and the friends who have wholeheartedly supported us!</t3184> <t3185>Whether someone is watching over me or not, I feel no difference anymore, because the night before, on two occasions when I woke up, I saw the professor sleeping on the couch. And yet, I still did not feel afraid to fall into a new sleep.</t3185> <t3186>Meanwhile, I don't know if it was the branches or the bats outside the window occasionally hitting the glass panes as if in anger.</t3186>
<t3187>“Pall Mall Gazette”, September 18</t3187>
<t3188>"The wolf has escaped."</t3188>
<t3189>The adventurous journey of a journalist interviewing a zookeeper.</t3189>
<t3190>After many futile efforts, and each time I liked to mention the words Pall Mall Gazette as a lucky charm, I finally found the caretaker of the wolf area in the zoo. Thomas Bilder resided in one of the houses near the elephant enclosure.</t3190> <t3191>I arrived at his house just as he was sitting down for tea.</t3191> <t3192>He and his wife were very hospitable.</t3192> <t3193>The couple was elderly, childless, and I thought they must have had a fairly comfortable life.</t3193> <t3194>The zookeeper refused to "talk business" until he had finished his meal, as he said, and of course, I did not intend to go against his wishes.</t3194>
<t3195>After clearing the dining table, he slowly lit his pipe before telling me:</t3195>
<t3196>— Now I can sit and listen, you can ask anything you want!</t3196> <t3197>Sorry for not intending to talk to you about the profession before finishing the meal, but just like wolves, jackals, and hyenas, I usually feed them before grilling them with questions.</t3197>
<t3198>— What, you can ask them too? - I asked just to start a conversation with the host.</t3198>
<t3199>— Either I hit them on the head with a stick, or I scratch their ears to please the young men who bring beautiful women here for fun after spending a few coins?</t3199> <t3200>My nature is not to disturb them before feeding them, but to be honest, I also like to give them a bit of coffee or a little light wine before scratching their ears, do you understand what I'm saying? Think about it - you speak like a philosopher - there are many similarities between animals and us.</t3200> <t3201>You've come here to ask about my profession, haven't you? To be honest, if you weren't young, I would have kicked you out a long time ago, so don't expect an answer from me!</t3201> <t3202>Now, just like the tigers and wolves out there, after having devoured the meal that the kind old lady has prepared to sit and drink tea and smoke a pipe like this, you can scratch my ears as much as you like, I won't be annoyed anymore.</t3202> <t3203>Come on, start.</t3203> <t3204>Ask! I'm waiting here?</t3204> <t3205>I know exactly that you're going to ask about the wolf that just escaped.</t3205>
<t3206>— That's right.</t3206> <t3207>In fact, I was about to ask what you think about this matter.</t3207> <t3208>Please tell me how it all happened.</t3208> <t3209>Once you've told me all the details, I'll ask you why, in your opinion, this animal was able to escape and how everything ended afterwards.</t3209>
<t3210>— All right, sir.</t3210> <t3211>If you ask, I will tell you.</t3211> <t3212>The wolf that we named Bersicker was bought by us along with two others four years ago.</t3212> <t3213>It was a very well-trained animal, so it never caused us any trouble.</t3213> <t3214>Yet it escaped!</t3214> <t3215>That is what surprised me greatly.</t3215> <t3216>But you see, clearly one cannot trust wolves as one trusts women.</t3216>
<t3217>— Don't listen to him, sir! - Mrs. Bilder said to me with a laugh. - For a very long time, I've always seen him throwing himself into those animals, to the point where I sometimes thought he had turned into an old wolf himself!</t3217> <t3218>But you know, he's not dangerous at all!</t3218>
<t3219>— Yes, boss, around two o'clock yesterday afternoon, when I was feeding those animals, I suddenly realized something was not right.</t3219> <t3220>When I went to the monkey cage area to lay straw bedding for a sick puma, I suddenly heard a series of savage howls.</t3220> <t3221>I immediately went to see what had happened.</t3221> <t3222>It turned out to be Bersicker's roars.</t3222> <t3223>The animal was raging madly, continuously charging at the bars as if trying to escape.</t3223> <t3224>At that time, there weren't many visitors, and near Bersicker's cage, there was only one person - a tall, slender man with a long, hooked nose, a long beard with a few white strands.</t3224> <t3225>His gaze was cruel and cold, his eyes gleamed as if they were on fire.</t3225> <t3226>Seeing him, I just wanted to chase him away, as it seemed the animal in the cage was going mad because of his presence.</t3226> <t3227>He was wearing white leather gloves.</t3227> <t3228>Seeing me approach, he pointed at the wolf and asked:</t3228>
<t3229>— Mr. Gardener, do you believe that there is something causing these animals to become agitated?</t3229>
<t3230>— Maybe it's because of you - I replied, as his gesture had really made me uncomfortable.</t3230>
<t3231>Instead of getting furious as I thought, he burst into loud laughter, a laugh that was both arrogant and bizarre, revealing two rows of sharp, white teeth.</t3231>
<t3232>— Oh, no - He replied with a grin - these animals don't find me to their taste!</t3232>
<t3233>— Oh. Yes, they are, they're relishing the smell of your meat.</t3233> <t3234>At this hour, they really want to gnaw on a few skinny bones to ease their itchy teeth, and when they see you...</t3234>
<t3235>There is a strange thing that when they saw us standing and talking, the wolves suddenly became quiet, and when I approached, Bersicker still let me pet him as usual.</t3235> <t3236>But even that old man could do the same with the old wolf that just died!</t3236>
<t3237>— Be careful, - I reminded him - this Bersicker is very fierce!</t3237>
<t3238>— What is there to be afraid of? - He replied - The wolves and I know each other well.</t3238>
<t3239>— Really!</t3239> <t3240>Do you also have the job of guarding wolves? - I asked in surprise, because I always considered those who guard wolves, that is, the owners, to be my friends.</t3240>
<t3241>— No, it's not like that, - The old man explained - No, I never kept wolves, but after all, sometimes there were a few that had quite a close relationship with me.</t3241>
<t3242>Speaking of this, the old man took off his hat and bowed with the mannerisms of a nobleman, then left.</t3242>
<t3243>The old wolf Bersicker stood still, watching the strange old man until he disappeared from sight.</t3243> <t3244>After that, it trudged into the corner of its cage and stayed there all evening.</t3244> <t3245>But strangely, as soon as the moon appeared, the pack of wolves began howling loudly for no apparent reason, while nearby, there was only one figure lurking, calling a house dog behind some flower gardens on Park Avenue.</t3245>
<t3246>There were also one or two times I went back to visit the animals, but nothing unusual happened then...</t3246> <t3247>Then suddenly, they all fell silent...</t3247> <t3248>After that, a few minutes before midnight, I decided to go back and check on them one more time before going to bed, and when I reached the old wolf Bersicker's cage, I was startled to see that the bars around the cage were twisted or broken in several places, and of course, there was nothing left in the cage! That's all I know, my friend</t3248><t3249>!</t3249>
<t3250>— Did you notice anyone noteworthy that evening?</t3250>
<t3251>— Also around midnight, on the way back after parting with the band, one of our soldiers suddenly saw a large gray-haired wolf unexpectedly dart out from behind a fence.</t3251> <t3252>Say what you will, it's just a story, and I don't quite believe it, because when he got home, he didn't bother to tell his wife a single word; it was only when he learned that the old wolf had disappeared, causing us to search all night, that he opened his mouth to tell the tale.</t3252> <t3253>In my opinion, he was probably mentally disturbed by the lingering clamor of the brass instruments.</t3253>
<t3254>— Mr. Bilder, can you now tell me why, in your opinion, the wolf managed to escape?</t3254>
<t3255>— Sure, I believe it can be explained.</t3255> <t3256>- The gardener answered with a humble demeanor. - But the only thing is, I don't know if my explanation will be enough to satisfy you.</t3256>
<t3257>— No problem, my friend, just stay calm?</t3257> <t3258>If you, someone who knows very well the behavior of animals, cannot accurately assert what happened, then please just tell the truth, alright?</t3258>
<t3259>— So, what do you think?</t3259> <t3260>Well, here's the thing: in my opinion, the wolf ran away simply because it wanted to return to the freedom of the sky.</t3260>
<t3261>After that joke, both Thomas and his wife burst into laughter.</t3261> <t3262>I understand that this is not the first time this kind old man has done such a thing.</t3262> <t3263>I used another method, which I considered more effective, to get information from him.</t3263>
<t3264>— Alright, Mr. Bilder, here's the deal: let's consider the half-pound I just gave you as payment for what it's worth, and here's another half-pound waiting for you once you tell me what you can.</t3264> <t3265>Now, in your opinion, how does the story end?</t3265>
<t3266>— Great!</t3266> <t3267>My friend, I hope you won't be stubborn, but just now, this old lady winked at me, signaling me to...</t3267>
<t3268>— Me? Don't speak so recklessly! - The wife objected.</t3268>
<t3269>— To be honest, I believe that wolf is hiding somewhere.</t3269> <t3270>That soldier said the animal ran madly towards the north, it ran even faster than a horse.</t3270> <t3271>I don't believe it, because you see, wolves sometimes run even slower than domestic dogs. That kid is just talking nonsense.</t3271> <t3272>Wolves can be terrifying creatures in mythical stories, when they gather together to hunt down some weak animal.</t3272> <t3273>But fortunately, God has mercy?</t3273> <t3274>In real life, wolves are even less capable than a domestic dog: they are more foolish and much less daring.</t3274> <t3275>That Bersicker, not trained in fighting or hunting, is probably just wandering around somewhere in this zoo waiting to starve to death.</t3275> <t3276>It could also be hiding in some coal cellar further away.</t3276> <t3277>Or perhaps, unable to find anything to eat, it has gone to lurk around a butcher's shop... and that's that!</t3277> <t3278>If not, it might have been thrown into some soldier's cart.</t3278> <t3279>If that happened, I wouldn't be surprised, because there are plenty of people around here.</t3279> <t3280>So, I think the story could end like that.</t3280>
<t3281>I was handing the old man half a pound as we had bargained when something suddenly appeared outside the window and thumped against the glass pane.</t3281> <t3282>The old man Bilder's face, which was already long, grew even longer in astonishment.</t3282>
<t3283>— Oh Lord! - He exclaimed - If that isn't the old wolf Bersicker returning, then what else could it be?</t3283>
<t3284>The old man stood up abruptly to open the door - an action which I thought was pointless.</t3284> <t3285>I always believed that a wild animal would never stay in one place once it recognized an obstacle between it and us.</t3285> <t3286>Experience has helped me affirm the correctness of this thought.</t3286>
<t3287>Indeed, old man Bilder and his wife were not afraid of wolves as I was afraid of domestic dogs.</t3287> <t3288>Contrary to my expectations, the animal remained calmly outside the door with a surprisingly gentle demeanor.</t3288> <t3289>It was so obedient that it made me recall its ancestor in the fairy tale of Little Red Riding Hood before revealing its true nature.</t3289>
<t3290>The scene of it returning to its nest had something both humorous and touching that I couldn't possibly describe.</t3290> <t3291>The vicious wolf that had made the entire city of London fearful for nearly a whole day suddenly appeared right in front of us with a completely different demeanor.</t3291> <t3292>Old man Bilder eagerly checked the animal from head to toe and then shouted:</t3292>
<t3293>— I knew it, I knew this animal would get into trouble; didn't I say so since yesterday?</t3293> <t3294>Look at its snout, it's all torn up, and it's still covered in glass shards! It must have tried to break through a wall.</t3294> <t3295>It's really shameful for any household that likes to put broken glass on their walls.</t3295> <t3296>See, it's terrible...</t3296> <t3297>Come here, Bersicker...</t3297>
<t3298>The old man gently pulled the animal into a stall and then locked the door.</t3298>
<t3299>He did not forget to toss it a piece of meat before heading to the house of the team leader to report the animal's return.</t3299>
<t3300>Dr. Seward's Diary</t3300>
<t3301>• September 17</t3301>
<t3302>After finishing dinner, I returned to my room, planning to schedule the next few working days.</t3302> <t3303>Suddenly, my door burst open, followed by the abrupt appearance of Renfield: he charged straight at me with a very fierce expression.</t3303> <t3304>I stood there stunned, as it was very rare for a patient to unexpectedly seek out the head doctor without anyone's permission.</t3304> <t3305>He was brandishing a gleaming knife.</t3305> <t3306>I immediately realized that in his madness, he could become very dangerous, so I cautiously stepped back, intending to use the wooden table as a barrier between him and me.</t3306> <t3307>But he was quicker than I was; before I could regain my balance, he had already slashed my left wrist quite deeply.</t3307> <t3308>However, not allowing him to swing the knife a second time, I immediately lunged at him, pushing him flat onto the floor.</t3308> <t3309>Blood from the wound on my hand pooled into a small puddle on the carpet.</t3309> <t3310>Renfield remained lying still, seemingly not intending to attack again.</t3310> <t3311>It was only then that I had time to bandage my wound while keeping my eyes fixed on the patient.</t3311> <t3312>When the attendants arrived, we gathered around to lift him up and push him back to his room, but he started thrashing and suddenly turned around to do something that astonished me once again: he crawled on the floor like a dog and licked up the blood that had just dripped from my wound.</t3312> <t3313>As he licked, he kept muttering the same phrase over and over: “Blood is life?</t3313> <t3314>Blood is life!”</t3314>
<t3315>Actually, I shouldn't have been careless enough to lose these drops of blood, even if it was just one drop.</t3315> <t3316>In the past few days, I have given enough blood already; what if Lucy loses blood again?</t3316> <t3317>I can't do any more, it seems like I am about to fall into exhaustion if I don't get a night's rest.</t3317> <t3318>Oh! Sleep? How I wish to sleep!</t3318> <t3319>Fortunately, Van Helsing didn't call for me, so I can sleep for a long time now.</t3319>
<t3320>Telegram from Van Helsing, Antwerp to Seward, Carfax</t3320>
<t3321>September 17</t3321>
<t3322>Tonight, remember to return to Hillingham.</t3322> <t3323>If you can't stay up all night, you should at least frequently check her room to see if the flowers are still in their proper place.</t3323> <t3324>It's very important.</t3324> <t3325>When I get to London, I will try to meet you as soon as possible within reason."</t3325>
<t3326>Dr. Seward's Diary</t3326>
<t3327>• September 18</t3327>
<t3328>I will take the train to London again. Van Helsing's telegram made me feel like my legs were about to give way.</t3328> <t3329>Good Lord! The experiences from the last few times have shown me what can happen in a single night.</t3329> <t3330>Things might go smoothly, but could the worst also happen?</t3330> <t3331>There must be some kind of curse haunting us, as every effort we make is met with the opposite of what we desire.</t3331>
<t3332>The memorandum left by Lucy Westenra</t3332>
<t3333>• September 17</t3333>
<t3334>I am writing these lines on loose sheets of paper so that someone can find and read them, because I want them to know exactly what happened tonight.</t3334> <t3335>I feel that I will die from weakness.</t3335> <t3336>Holding the pen to write is extremely difficult for me now, but I must write, even if the Grim Reaper intends to hold my pen tightly.</t3336>
<t3337>As usual, I lay down on the bed after putting a garland around my neck as ordered by Professor Van Helsing, and I fell asleep almost immediately.</t3337> <t3338>But I was awakened by the sound of wings flapping against the window, the same sounds I first heard when I was in Whitby, precisely when I was sleepwalking and wandered up the cliff, causing Mina to come looking for me, and since then, I have often heard those eerie wing flaps.</t3338> <t3339>Though not afraid, I still wanted Dr. Seward in the next room so I could call him if needed.</t3339> <t3340>I tried to fall back asleep but couldn't.</t3340> <t3341>And then the fear of falling asleep again overwhelmed me, forcing me to decide not to sleep anymore.</t3341> <t3342>But strangely, the more I tried to stay awake, the heavier the drowsiness weighed on me.</t3342> <t3343>The feeling of loneliness scared me.</t3343> <t3344>I jumped up, opened the door, and called out, "Is anyone there?" There was no response.</t3344> <t3345>I didn't dare call again for fear of waking my mother.</t3345> <t3346>Just as I closed the door, a howl, more mournful and terrifying than a dog's, echoed from somewhere beneath the bushes.</t3346> <t3347>I went to the window and leaned out to see what was in the darkness, but I couldn't make out anything except a large bat - perhaps the same creature that often flapped its wings against my window.</t3347> <t3348>I returned to bed but didn't feel sleepy again.</t3348> <t3349>A moment later, my mother slightly opened the door and peeked in.</t3349> <t3350>Seeing that I was awake, she stepped in and sat near my bed.</t3350> <t3351>She gently took my hand and spoke to me in a voice much softer and gentler than usual:</t3351>
<t3352>— Mom kept wondering if you needed anything, my dear daughter, so she had to come up here to be sure.</t3352>
<t3353>Afraid that she might catch a cold, I told her to lie down next to me, but she said she only intended to stay for a while before returning to her room.</t3353><t3354>Even while snug in her arms, I was startled because that bizarre noise suddenly echoed again.</t3354><t3355>My mother also jumped and exclaimed, "What was that?"</t3355><t3356>I had to find words to reassure her.</t3356><t3357>Finally, she lay down beside me, although her heart was still pounding.</t3357><t3358>But then I was startled once more because something suddenly struck the windowpane, shattering it.</t3358><t3359>Shards of glass scattered all over the yard.</t3359><t3360>The curtain fluttered in the wind like a ghost.</t3360><t3361>My body began to tremble like a leaf when I saw the head of a large, emaciated wolf poking through the broken window.</t3361><t3362>My mother let out a terrified scream.</t3362><t3363>She sat up on the bed, her hands flailing wildly as if trying to grab something for protection.</t3363><t3364>In her panic, she tore off the garland around my neck and threw it across the room.</t3364><t3365>After that desperate act, she sat there dazed as if she had lost her soul, while her hand still pointed towards the wolf like a statue.</t3365><t3366>After a moment, she suddenly collapsed as if struck by lightning, her head hitting my forehead.</t3366><t3367>I was stunned for a moment.</t3367><t3368>The room, and everything around it, seemed to be spinning before my eyes, but I kept my gaze fixed on the window; the wolf had disappeared.</t3368><t3369>Tiny specks swirled into the room through the broken window - this scene reminded me of sand columns swept up by the wind in the desert.</t3369><t3370>I tried to sit up but to no avail, some mysterious force prevented me from doing so.</t3370><t3371>My mother's body now seemed slightly cold...</t3371><t3372>Suddenly, I lost consciousness of everything.</t3372><t3373>Everything that happened afterward did not linger in my memory.</t3373>
<t3374>Although I had only fainted for a short time, I was still very vague about the terrifying moments that had passed.</t3374> <t3375>When I regained consciousness, the first sound that reached my ears was the distant ringing of a death knell, followed by the barking of dogs around the house, and from the bushes in the garden, not far from my window, came the melodious singing of a nightingale.</t3375> <t3376>Sorrow, fear, and severe health deterioration all seemed to come at once, leaving me as lifeless as a dead person.</t3376> <t3377>However, hearing the nightingale's song, I felt as if I were hearing my mother's beloved voice, gently speaking in the dark to comfort me.</t3377>
<t3378>Surely the strange noise had awakened the servants in the house, because I could clearly hear their bare footsteps softly stepping on the stair landing.</t3378> <t3379>Hearing my faint call, they quickly stepped into the room.</t3379> <t3380>They all screamed in fear; it goes without saying how terrified they were when they realized the misfortune that had befallen us and saw my mother lying on top of me.</t3380> <t3381>The wind blowing through the broken window occasionally made the door creak.</t3381> <t3382>The brave girls gathered around to move my mother aside so I could sit up.</t3382> <t3383>Knowing they were very emotional, I told them to go down to the dining room and have a sip of wine to calm down.</t3383> <t3384>They opened the door and then slammed it shut immediately after stepping out of the room.</t3384> <t3385>I could still hear them exclaim once more, followed by the sound of hurried footsteps rushing down the stairs.</t3385> <t3386>At that moment, I didn't know what to do except painfully pick up the flowers to place on my mother's chest and recall Professor Van Helsing's instructions, but remembering was just for the sake of remembering, as I no longer needed these flowers for anything.</t3386> <t3387>I anxiously waited for the servants to return: we would keep vigil together.</t3387> <t3388>But they did not return.</t3388> <t3389>I called out: no one answered.</t3389> <t3390>Finding it strange, I decided to grope my way down to the dining room.</t3390>
<t3391>I nearly collapsed when I unexpectedly witnessed the scene before my eyes: four maidservants were sprawled on the floor, breathing laboriously.</t3391><t3392>A half-empty wine bottle still sat neatly on the table, but the room was filled with a strange pungent odor.</t3392><t3393>I picked up the wine bottle and sniffed: it was all the smell of cannabis alcohol.</t3393><t3394>Opening the buffet cabinet, I realized the medicine bottle that the doctor used to care for my mother was completely empty.</t3394><t3395>What should I do now? What should I do?...</t3395><t3396>I staggered back to my room, to the bedside with my mother.</t3396><t3397>I couldn't leave her.</t3397><t3398>Now I was in the room alone, if not counting the poor maidservants lying unconscious downstairs due to the opium alcohol someone had poured into the wine bottle.</t3398><t3399>Alone with death?</t3399><t3400>And I didn't dare go outside, as the savage howling of the wolf somewhere still echoed in my ears through the broken window.</t3400><t3401>Those tiny specks wouldn't stop dancing, spinning madly in the room with each gust of wind through the window.</t3401><t3402>Even the candlelight now seemed dim, as if signaling an imminent demise...</t3402><t3403>What should I do now? Perhaps the time has come for me to depart with her!</t3403><t3404>Farewell, everyone!</t3404><t3405>Arthur, if I must die tonight, then I bid you farewell as well!</t3405>
<t3406>CHAPTER 12</t3406>
<t3407>Dr. Seward's Diary</t3407>
<t3408>• September 18</t3408>
<t3409>I arrived at Hillingham very early.</t3409> <t3410>Leaving the car parked outside the gate, I walked all the way to the house.</t3410> <t3411>I knocked on the door very gently so as not to wake Lucy and Mrs. Westenra if they were still sleeping.</t3411> <t3412>I hoped that only the servants would hear the knock.</t3412> <t3413>After waiting a while and seeing no one come out, I knocked again, then banged harder.</t3413> <t3414>There was still no response.</t3414> <t3415>I began to get annoyed with the servants, as it was almost ten in the morning and they were still sound asleep.</t3415> <t3416>Thinking about it made me furious and impatient, so I banged on the door repeatedly, but it was all in vain.</t3416> <t3417>Granted, the servants were mainly responsible for this silence, but for some reason, an indescribable fear surged within me.</t3417> <t3418>Could this silence be yet another sign of the curse that has been haunting us for so long?</t3418> <t3419>Do I really have the courage to step into a house where death has arrived before me?</t3419> <t3420>I knew that every minute, every second that passed could lead to extremely dire consequences for Lucy if her health deteriorated once again, so I decided to circle around the house in the hope of finding an entrance I had not known before.</t3420>
<t3421>All the doors were tightly locked, and the windows were firmly shut, which made me extremely disappointed.</t3421> <t3422>I could only return to the original place.</t3422> <t3423>Just as I reached the main door, I suddenly felt a sense of suspicion when I heard the sound of horse hooves pounding on the road, then abruptly stopping right in front of the gate; a few seconds later, I recognized Van Helsing's figure stepping down from the carriage, he hurriedly ran into the house.</t3423> <t3424>Seeing me, he immediately asked, panting:</t3424>
<t3425>— Ah! So it's you? So you just arrived as well?</t3425> <t3426>How is she?</t3426> <t3427>Is there still time?</t3427> <t3428>Didn't you receive my message?</t3428>
<t3429>I tried to answer clearly and concisely that I had just received his call early in the morning, that I had arranged all my work to come here immediately.</t3429> <t3430>I knocked and knocked repeatedly but still didn't get any response.</t3430>
<t3431>Van Helsing took off his hat and stood silently for a moment.</t3431> <t3432>Finally, he spoke to me in a very serious tone:</t3432>
<t3433>— I suppose we have arrived too late.</t3433> <t3434>The will of God has come true!</t3434>
<t3435>He paused as if to gather more courage, then resolutely said:</t3435>
<t3436>— Go! If all the doors are closed, we must find some way to get into the house.</t3436>
<t3437>We both went around to the back of the house.</t3437> <t3438>Van Helsing held a scalpel and pointed towards a kitchen window.</t3438> <t3439>I slid a thin knife through the gap in the door, flipped the latch, and opened the two window panes wide.</t3439> <t3440>I helped the professor climb into the kitchen first, then I followed.</t3440> <t3441>There was no one in the kitchen, nor in the pantry.</t3441> <t3442>We peeked into the rooms on the ground floor, but they were all empty.</t3442> <t3443>Only when we reached the dining room, thanks to a faint light filtering through the fanlights, did we notice four servants lying on the floor.</t3443> <t3444>We didn't think they were dead, as their heavy opium-laced breaths in the room indicated their condition.</t3444> <t3445>Van Helsing calmly told me, "We will come back to them later," then immediately pulled me up to Lucy's room. However, when we got there, we didn't enter right away but stopped at the door to listen: everything was eerily silent.</t3445> <t3446>We nervously opened the door, filled with suspense and anxiety.</t3446>
<t3447>I don't know how to describe the scene before my eyes.</t3447> <t3448>Both Lucy and her mother were lying on the bed.</t3448> <t3449>On the mother's body was a white sheet, the edge of which was blown back by the wind from the broken window, revealing a pale face, deeply etched with lines of terror.</t3449> <t3450>Lucy’s face looked even more miserable.</t3450> <t3451>The garland around her neck was now placed on Mrs. Westenra's chest.</t3451> <t3452>I could easily see that the two small wounds on her had now become much deeper and wider compared to a few days ago, and I didn't understand why.</t3452> <t3453>Without a word, Professor Van Helsing bent low over the bed, his head almost touching Lucy's chest; after listening for about a second, he suddenly stood up and told me:</t3453>
<t3454>— It's not too late yet! Hurry up, hurry up? Strong liquor!</t3454>
<t3455>I rushed down to the dining room, grabbed a bottle of wine, brought it to my nose to smell, and then tasted it to ensure that no one had poured opium into the bottle.</t3455>
<t3456>The servants were still lying down, breathing; their breaths now seemed lighter and more regular; perhaps the effects of the opium tincture were gradually wearing off.</t3456> <t3457>I hurried back to Lucy's room. Van Helsing grabbed the bottle of wine, poured some into his hand, and rubbed it vigorously on Lucy's lips, wrists, and forearms.</t3457> <t3458>After completing this emergency task, he softly said to me:</t3458>
<t3459>— That's enough for now. There's nothing else to do at the moment.</t3459> <t3460>Go downstairs and wake those girls up.</t3460> <t3461>Just use a wet towel to slap their faces, don't worry about being cruel! I need them awake to light a fire and boil some hot water.</t3461> <t3462>This girl is almost freezing to death, her body is like a block of ice.</t3462> <t3463>She needs to be warmed up first, then we can do anything else.</t3463>
<t3464>I had no difficulty waking up the first three servants; but the fourth one lay there like a child, seemingly the most affected by the opium.</t3464> <t3465>I had to carry her to the couch so she could continue sleeping.</t3465> <t3466>The three girls who had just woken up were dazed like simpletons.</t3466> <t3467>However, when they suddenly remembered what had happened, they burst into tears and sobbingly recounted the events to me.</t3467> <t3468>But I remained resolute and stern, not allowing them to go on for long.</t3468> <t3469>I told them that one death in the house was enough, and that if they kept lamenting, Lucy might be next.</t3469> <t3470>Hearing this, they had no choice but to sob their way into the kitchen.</t3470> <t3471>Fortunately, the stove was still on, so the water in the pot was still hot.</t3471> <t3472>After preparing the bath, we placed Lucy in to soak.</t3472> <t3473>While we were focused on massaging her limbs, there was a sudden knock at the gate.</t3473> <t3474>A servant hurried out to open the door.</t3474> <t3475>A moment later, she ran back in to inform us that a man was waiting outside, saying he had a letter from Holmwood. Knowing we couldn't receive guests at that moment, I sent someone to ask him to kindly wait.</t3475> <t3476>To be honest, I immediately forgot about his presence; all I could do now was focus on saving the patient.</t3476>
<t3477>Since working with Van Helsing, I have never seen him fight against death in this manner.</t3477> <t3478>Because both of us knew that this was the only way, the ultimate battle against a death.</t3478> <t3479>When I whispered that, he stood still for a moment.</t3479> <t3480>I did not understand his response, but just by looking at his serious expression, I knew.</t3480>
<t3481>— If that's all, - he said - I will try to leave this place, and I will let the little girl rest peacefully, because I am not sure if life will come to her anymore.</t3481>
<t3482>However, he continued his efforts to massage his young patient tirelessly.</t3482>
<t3483>There was no need to wait long; we began to notice that the hot water tub had taken effect.</t3483> <t3484>Through the stethoscope, I felt Lucy's heartbeat and breathing gradually stabilizing.</t3484> <t3485>When lifting her out of the tub and wrapping her in several layers of warm towels, Van Helsing told me, his face looking somewhat less heavy:</t3485>
<t3486>— In the first step, we have achieved victory? The Grim Reaper is retreating!</t3486>
<t3487>We placed Lucy in another room.</t3487> <t3488>I laid her on the bed and dropped a few drops of strong liquor into her mouth.</t3488> <t3489>Van Helsing wrapped a very soft silk scarf around her neck.</t3489> <t3490>She still hadn't woken up.</t3490> <t3491>Looking at her face, I knew she was going through a pain I had never seen before.</t3491>
<t3492>Professor Van Helsing called a servant up and ordered her to stand at the head of the bed to watch the patient, instructing her not to take her eyes off until we returned.</t3492> <t3493>Then, he waved his hand to signal me to step out of the room with him.</t3493>
<t3494>— Now we have to think about what we need to do next. - The professor told me while going down the stairs.</t3494>
<t3495>The two of us stepped into the dining room to talk more conveniently.</t3495> <t3496>The windows in the room were all open but covered with thick curtains.</t3496> <t3497>The professor turned around and carefully closed the door, the room darkened, but the light filtering through the windows was still enough for us to recognize everything around us.</t3497> <t3498>The serious expression on the professor's face earlier was gone, replaced by a look of confusion.</t3498> <t3499>Clearly, he was trying to find a way to solve some new difficulty.</t3499>
<t3500>— That's it!</t3500> <t3501>What should we do now? - He pondered.</t3501> <t3502>- Who will help us?</t3502> <t3503>Anyway, we have to perform another blood transfusion.</t3503> <t3504>Yes, another one, as soon as possible, otherwise that poor girl won't survive another hour.</t3504> <t3505>Young man, like me, you look exhausted.</t3505> <t3506>As for me, I don't want to force those helpers to donate blood even if they have the courage to do so.</t3506> <t3507>Where can we find a blood donor now?</t3507>
<t3508>— Am I not here?</t3508>
<t3509>A sudden voice echoed from the settee on the other side of the room; I immediately breathed a sigh of relief, for I could not be mistaken, it was the voice of Quincey Morris.</t3509> <t3510>At first, Van Helsing seemed very angry, he turned sharply to look at the young guest, but then his face gradually softened, his eyes brightened considerably.</t3510> <t3511>I spread my arms and quickly walked towards my friend, exclaiming:</t3511>
<t3512>— Quincey Morris!</t3512> <t3513>What wind has brought you here?</t3513> <t3514>It must be Arthur who...</t3514><t3515>.</t3515>
<t3516>Instead of an answer, he handed me a telegram.</t3516> <t3517>I anxiously read it immediately:</t3517>
<t3518>“No news from Seward for three days.</t3518> <t3519>Terribly worried.</t3519> <t3520>Cannot leave father, he is still sick.</t3520> <t3521>Let me know Lucy's condition immediately.</t3521> <t3522>Holmwood.”</t3522>
<t3523>— I think I have arrived just in time.</t3523> <t3524>- Quincey said.</t3524> <t3525>- Now you just need to tell me what I have to do, don't say any more.</t3525>
<t3526>Van Helsing stepped forward and firmly grasped the hand of the newly arrived guest:</t3526>
<t3527>— When a woman is exhausted and in need of a blood transfusion, the blood of a brave man will be the only salvation that can save her.</t3527> <t3528>The devil may take all power to oppose us, but God will always bring us truly courageous men.</t3528>
<t3529>Without much ado, we hurriedly began a new blood transfusion.</t3529> <t3530>The work was so exhausting that I can't recount every detail here.</t3530> <t3531>Lucy must have gone through a terrible shock, because this time she didn't react as she had before.</t3531> <t3532>If you saw her, heard her sobbing and fighting against death to return to life, you wouldn't be able to hold back your emotions.</t3532> <t3533>But then her heartbeat became more regular, and the labored breaths from her chest visibly improved.</t3533> <t3534>After the transfusion, Van Helsing carefully injected her with a dose of morphine, wanting to turn her pathological unconsciousness into a normal deep sleep.</t3534> <t3535>The professor stayed to watch over Lucy, while I had to take Quincey downstairs and instruct a servant to pay the coachman waiting outside the gate.</t3535> <t3536>After giving Quincey a glass of wine, I helped him lie down on the couch and told the cook to prepare him a nutritious lunch.</t3536> <t3537>As if suddenly remembering something, I immediately returned to the patient's room.</t3537> <t3538>Van Helsing was still standing there, holding some papers in his hand.</t3538> <t3539>At a glance, I knew he was suspecting something.</t3539> <t3540>He handed me the papers and tersely said something out of the blue:</t3540>
<t3541>— Lucy's blouse fell off when we lifted her out of the bathtub.</t3541>
<t3542>After reading the few sheets of paper, I secretly glanced at the professor for a moment before daring to ask:</t3542>
<t3543>— My God, what is going on?</t3543> <t3544>Is she, or rather, is she going crazy?</t3544> <t3545>Or is there some terrible danger lurking somewhere around us?</t3545>
<t3546>Van Helsing took back the papers from my hand.</t3546>
<t3547>— Now is not the time for you to be overthinking, - He said - try to forget about it.</t3547> <t3548>Time will answer everything for you, will help you understand everything.</t3548> <t3549>But not now.</t3549> <t3550>Later on...</t3550> <t3551>Why did you come back here?</t3551> <t3552>Is there something you want to say?</t3552>
<t3553>The professor's question helped me return to myself.</t3553>
<t3554>— Yes, it's about the death certificate.</t3554> <t3555>If we don't complete all the necessary procedures, someone will definitely come to investigate.</t3555> <t3556>I believe it's unnecessary for that to happen, as it could very well break poor little Lucy's heart.</t3556> <t3557>The professor, myself, and Mrs. Westenra's doctor all know why she died, and we just need to fill out the death certificate according to what actually happened.</t3557> <t3558>Perhaps we should do it right away.</t3558> <t3559>I will personally take the document to the authorities, and then I will find someone to handle the funeral arrangements.</t3559>
<t3560>— That's good, my friend John! You think very deeply?</t3560> <t3561>Indeed, if Lucy is being haunted by dark shadows, at least she can find some comfort in always having loved ones by her side.</t3561> <t3562>There have been one, two, and three men ready to open their veins to give her blood, of course, I am not counting my old body.</t3562> <t3563>Truly, I am very grateful to you, my friend John! And I very much want you to continue to promote that precious quality.</t3563> <t3564>Now, perhaps we should go downstairs!</t3564>
<t3565>Down the corridor, we met Quincey Morris again as he was preparing to send a telegram to Arthur to inform him about Mrs. Westenra's death and Lucy's health condition.</t3565> <t3566>When I said I had to leave for a while, Quincey didn't hold me back but just asked one question:</t3566>
<t3567>— Jack, when you come back, could you spare a moment to talk with me?</t3567>
<t3568>I gently nodded in agreement.</t3568>
<t3569>When it came to Mrs. Westenra's death, the civil servant did not cause me any trouble.</t3569> <t3570>And the local funeral director eagerly promised me that he would come in the late afternoon to handle all related matters.</t3570>
<t3571>When I returned, Quincey was still waiting.</t3571> <t3572>I told him that after visiting Lucy, I would come down to talk to him.</t3572> <t3573>Lucy was still sleeping, and it seemed Van Helsing had been sitting by her bed the entire time I was away.</t3573> <t3574>Seeing me enter, the professor quickly put his finger to his lips, signaling for me to keep quiet.</t3574> <t3575>He must have thought that Lucy was about to wake up, but he wanted her sleep to be natural, and her awakening to be something natural as well, not forced by any noise.</t3575> <t3576>Therefore, I had to go down to meet Quincey.</t3576> <t3577>I invited him to a brighter living room, as this room did not have the curtains drawn.</t3577> <t3578>As soon as we sat down, Quincey spoke:</t3578>
<t3579>— Jack Seward, I don't want to speak carelessly about things I don't fully understand, but it seems the situation is very particularly serious.</t3579> <t3580>You know that I also love this girl very much and that I once proposed to her.</t3580> <t3581>Although that is a thing of the past, I still care and worry a lot.</t3581> <t3582>In fact, I still don't know exactly what is wrong with Lucy and what pain she is enduring.</t3582> <t3583>Earlier, when we were in the dining room over there, I heard the Dutch professor tell you that another blood transfusion is needed, but he also mentioned that both you and he are exhausted.</t3583> <t3584>So, Van Helsing and you have each given blood to Lucy at least once, is that correct?</t3584>
<t3585>— Exactly like that.</t3585>
<t3586>— I even think that Arthur did the same.</t3586> <t3587>Four days ago, when we met, I saw that he also looked very pale.</t3587> <t3588>I have never seen anyone change so quickly, except for once when I witnessed my beloved horse being attacked by a bat that people call a "vampire," which tore its neck artery and drained all its blood.</t3588> <t3589>That night, the horse was too weak to stand up, and I had to put a bullet in its head to spare it a painful death.</t3589> <t3590>Jack, if it weren't for professional secrecy, please tell me.</t3590> <t3591>Was Arthur the first person to donate blood?</t3591>
<t3592>The more he spoke, the more the young man revealed his lack of composure in hiding his worries about the health condition of the unfortunate girl he still loved.</t3592> <t3593>I noticed that he was just one step away from bursting into tears.</t3593>
<t3594>I remained silent, contemplating before answering Quincey, because I was hesitating whether to tell the whole truth or not, as I was unsure of Professor Van Helsing's reaction.</t3594> <t3595>But clearly, he already knew a little, and it was also possible that he was guessing that I couldn't avoid answering his question.</t3595>
<t3596>— That's right, - I replied - Arthur was the first.</t3596>
<t3597>— So when did it happen?</t3597>
<t3598>— About ten days ago.</t3598>
<t3599>— Ten days? So the poor girl whom we all love has received blood from four people within just ten days?</t3599> <t3600>Under normal circumstances, that amount of blood would be too much for a delicate body like hers.</t3600>
<t3601>Quincey suddenly sat close to me:</t3601>
<t3602>— So why is she still so anemic?</t3602>
<t3603>— That is still a question mark.</t3603> <t3604>- I shook my head. - Both Van Helsing and I are still unclear as to why.</t3604> <t3605>It is true that some force has been opposing the professor's efforts.</t3605> <t3606>But that no longer seems to be happening.</t3606> <t3607>Now we have decided to stay here until everything turns out well, or until everything is over.</t3607>
<t3608>Quincey tightly grasped my hand.</t3608>
<t3609>— I will give you a hand.</t3609> <t3610>- He said - Just tell me what the Dutch professor and you want me to do, and I will do it immediately.</t3610>
<t3611>In the afternoon, when she woke up, to my astonishment, the first thing Lucy did was to slip her hand under her nightgown to take out the pieces of paper that Van Helsing had given me to read.</t3611> <t3612>The professor had carefully put them back in their original place, fearing that if she woke up and didn't see those pieces of paper, she would be frightened.</t3612> <t3613>Holding the pieces of paper in her hand, she looked at Van Helsing for a moment and then turned to look at me, appearing genuinely satisfied.</t3613> <t3614>Then she looked around the room like a child getting acquainted with a new world, but when she suddenly realized this wasn't her room, she burst into tears and covered her face with her hands, which were still pale as if she had drowned.</t3614> <t3615>It was only at this moment that she remembered the reality that she had lost her mother.</t3615> <t3616>We gathered around to comfort and console her.</t3616> <t3617>If we could ease her heart even a little, she would be less tormented by the pain.</t3617> <t3618>But Lucy continued to sob in front of us.</t3618> <t3619>It was only when I said that from now on, either Van Helsing and I would be together, or we would take turns being with her, that she felt a little more at ease.</t3619>
<t3620>The night fell, she began to drift into sleep again.</t3620> <t3621>One more thing surprised me: while sleeping, she held the pieces of paper she had torn earlier and ripped them in half.</t3621> <t3622>Van Helsing tried to remove those pieces of paper, but she held on very tightly and even tore them into smaller pieces.</t3622> <t3623>Finally, she raised her hand and spread her fingers as if she wanted to throw the tiny pieces of paper high into the air.</t3623> <t3624>Van Helsing was very puzzled, but he didn't say anything.</t3624>
<t3625>• September 19</t3625>
<t3626>Throughout that night, Lucy slept uneasily.</t3626> <t3627>I noticed several times that she showed signs of a fear of sleeping, but eventually, she still fell into a deep sleep.</t3627> <t3628>It was precisely this deep sleep that revealed all the frail features on her sorrowful face, even more clearly than when she was awake.</t3628> <t3629>Van Helsing and I took turns watching over her; we did not dare leave her alone for even a minute.</t3629> <t3630>I don't know what Quincey Morris was thinking, but throughout the night, I kept seeing him pacing around the house.</t3630>
<t3631>In the morning, looking at Lucy, we knew that she had no strength left.</t3631><t3632>I didn't dare to exaggerate because there were times when she couldn't even turn or move her head from one side to the other.</t3632><t3633>It seemed that the scant nutrition we gave her yesterday had not been digested and converted into energy.</t3633><t3634>Occasionally, Van Helsing and I anxiously observed the changes on her face while she was deeply asleep in the morning.</t3634><t3635>There were also times when her breathing was slower and more regular.</t3635><t3636>She slept with her mouth wide open, exposing her purplish gums receding deep below the gum line, making her teeth appear much longer and sharper than usual.</t3636><t3637>When she woke up, the gentleness in her eyes, though still drowsy, restored the familiar emotions of her usual self.</t3637><t3638>In the afternoon, she suddenly demanded to see Arthur; we had to telegraph him to come, and Quincey would be the one to go to the station to pick him up.</t3638>
<t3639>Arthur arrived at around 6 o'clock.</t3639> <t3640>The afternoon weather was still hot, and the patient's cheeks seemed to blush under the lingering rays of sunlight in the room.</t3640> <t3641>Seeing Lucy, Arthur had to try very hard to hide his emotions.</t3641> <t3642>None of us had the courage to tell him the truth.</t3642> <t3643>Arthur's appearance seemed to gradually restore Lucy's strength.</t3643> <t3644>Since she arrived at her house, I had never seen her speak so animatedly.</t3644>
<t3645>It is now almost one o'clock; Van Helsing and Arthur are still watching over the patient.</t3645> <t3646>In about fifteen minutes, I will take over their shift.</t3646> <t3647>While waiting, I have recorded these details into Lucy's phonograph.</t3647> <t3648>After I take over, the two of them will take the opportunity to sleep until 6 AM.</t3648> <t3649>Hopefully, tomorrow, we won't need to stay up to watch over her anymore.</t3649> <t3650>Then the poor girl will have to recover.</t3650> <t3651>God help us!</t3651>
<t3652>Mina Harker's letter to Lucy Westenra</t3652>
<t3653>(The recipient has not opened the letter)</t3653>
<t3654>"September 17"</t3654>
<t3655>Dear Lucy,</t3655>
<t3656>I feel like a whole century has passed without hearing any news from you, or more precisely, I haven't written to you for a century.</t3656> <t3657>I hope you will forgive me after reading these lines.</t3657> <t3658>First, I must inform you that my spouse and I have moved back here.</t3658> <t3659>When we got off the train in Exeter, I saw Mr. Hawkins, despite being tormented by gout, already sitting in the car waiting to pick us up.</t3659> <t3660>Hawkins himself drove us to his house.</t3660> <t3661>The three of us had dinner together.</t3661> <t3662>He provided us with very comfortable rooms.</t3662> <t3663>After dinner, he said to us:</t3663>
<t3664>— My friends, I have drunk to your health and happiness for a hundred years! May you always have complete joys?</t3664> <t3665>I have known you since you were young, so I am very proud to witness your growth.</t3665> <t3666>Today, I want you to consider this place as your own home.</t3666> <t3667>I live alone, without any children, so I will write a will to leave all my assets to you.</t3667>
<t3668>Lucy, hearing Mr. Hawkins speak, seeing the scene of him and my husband shaking hands for a long time, I couldn't hold back my tears.</t3668> <t3669>That evening was so incredibly happy.</t3669>
<t3670>So, we were lucky enough to move into a beautiful, ancient house.</t3670> <t3671>All the rooms we have access to, from the bedroom to the dining room and the living room, overlook the old elm trees surrounding the chapel, but the only thing is, at night, I often have to listen to the crows flying back and forth over the roof.</t3671> <t3672>These crows are really noisy, they keep cawing incessantly, giving me a headache.</t3672> <t3673>What can I tell you now? Currently, I am very busy arranging the house and furniture.</t3673> <t3674>As for Jonathan, he is buried in work all day long because he is now Mr. Hawkins' assistant - who is urgently handing over all the work related to each client to him.</t3674>
<t3675>How is your mother doing?</t3675> <t3676>I really want to visit her and you for a few days, but right now it's too difficult, I still have a lot of work to do.</t3676> <t3677>Moreover, even if Jonathan gets better, his illness still hasn't fully recovered.</t3677> <t3678>Honestly, he still looks very weak.</t3678> <t3679>Occasionally, I see him startle in his sleep and then wake up in a panic, his face bewildered like a lost soul, his body trembling.</t3679> <t3680>Every time that happens, I have to comfort and soothe him. Thank God, his condition is improving every day, and I dare to hope that gradually he will fully recover.</t3680> <t3681>Now, allow me to ask a few questions about your situation.</t3681> <t3682>When do you plan to get married, and where? Who will officiate?</t3682> <t3683>What dress do you plan to wear? Will you invite many friends or just have a simple ceremony?</t3683> <t3684>Remember to answer, my dear friend, because you know well that I always think of you and care about what you are holding in your heart.</t3684> <t3685>Jonathan also asked me to send you his sincere regards and best wishes, but I swear that is still not enough for a young assistant of a big company like Hawkins and Harker. Just as you love me and he loves me, I send you their heartfelt feelings.</t3685> <t3686>Goodbye, dear Lucy.</t3686> <t3687>Wishing you a thousand times happiness.</t3687>
<t3688>Your Mina.</t3688>
<t3689>Report from psychiatrist Patrick Hennessey to Dr. John Seward</t3689>
<t3690>"September 20"</t3690>
<t3691>Dear colleague.</t3691>
<t3692>I would like to report that the condition of several patients under my care is nothing noteworthy.</t3692> <t3693>As for Renfield's case, I find there is much to be said.</t3693> <t3694>He had another episode, but this time it ended without any unfortunate consequences.</t3694> <t3695>By the way, I should also mention that this afternoon, a truck with two men appeared at the abandoned house near our hospital—the house where Renfield twice escaped and crossed over to, you remember? These two men stopped in front of the hospital to ask the gatekeeper for directions, as far as I know, they are not locals.</t3695> <t3696>At that time, I had just finished lunch and was standing outside my office smoking, so I noticed one of the men heading towards the hospital's outer corridor.</t3696> <t3697>When he passed by Renfield's window, the patient immediately sprang up and started cursing wildly.</t3697> <t3698>He cursed that the man was not only there to steal but also intended to kill him, and he swore that next time, he wouldn't let the man harm him.</t3698> <t3699>I opened the window and told the truck driver not to take it to heart.</t3699> <t3700>After glancing back at the front of the hospital building, the man realized where he was standing.</t3700> <t3701>Only then did he say to me:</t3701>
<t3702>— May God bless you.</t3702> <t3703>Indeed, I still cannot fully imagine the scene of having to stand before a group of madmen.</t3703> <t3704>I truly sympathize with you and your master for having to live among such fierce individuals!</t3704>
<t3705>Then the man politely asked me for directions to the abandoned house next door.</t3705> <t3706>I courteously gave him the directions.</t3706> <t3707>He left, but Renfield continued to madly spew out a torrent of curses and threats.</t3707> <t3708>When I went down to visit him, I kept wondering if this time I could find out the reason for his anger.</t3708>
<t3709>When I went down to his room, I was very surprised because I didn't understand why he was so quiet and gentle.</t3709> <t3710>I tried to ask him what he had to say about what had happened, but he asked me back what I meant.</t3710> <t3711>I felt as if he truly didn't remember anything anymore.</t3711> <t3712>It was really unpleasant if that was just another example of his cunning mind, because less than half an hour later, he made me talk about him again.</t3712> <t3713>This time, he jumped out of the window and ran away at full speed.</t3713> <t3714>Afraid he might do something wrong, I had to call some guards and told them to catch him at all costs.</t3714> <t3715>And I wasn't wrong.</t3715> <t3716>A while later, I saw the truck turning back towards the hospital, now carrying large crates.</t3716> <t3717>The two guys on the truck were wiping sweat off their foreheads, their faces red as if they had just gone through a fierce struggle.</t3717> <t3718>Before I could catch the patient, he had already jumped onto the truck, grabbed one of the drivers by the neck, and pulled him to the ground, then he grabbed the victim's hair and repeatedly smashed his head against the road.</t3718> <t3719>If I hadn't run after him in time, he probably would have beaten the man to death.</t3719>
<t3720>The other driver also hurriedly jumped to the ground, holding a rubber hose and whipping it continuously at the patient.</t3720> <t3721>These blows should have made him scream in pain, but no, he didn't seem to feel anything, because after that he calmly stood up and fought back against the man attacking him, then he attacked all three of us, pushing us around easily as if we were just a bunch of scrawny cats.</t3721> <t3722>You know that I'm just a skinny guy, but I can't say the same for the two truck drivers: they were as strong as bulls.</t3722> <t3723>At first, he didn't say a word, only when we tried to subdue him and when the guards put the straitjacket on him did he scream: "I am ruining their plans!</t3723> <t3724>They can't steal from me, they can't kill me anymore! I must fight for God and for my master!” He kept spewing out crazy words that no one could understand.</t3724> <t3725>It was very difficult for us to get him back to the hospital and lock him in a room.</t3725> <t3726>As for the two truck drivers, at first, they kept threatening to take this assault to court; but later, I noticed mixed in with those threats were words of regret and remorse for letting a madman beat them up like that.</t3726> <t3727>They both tried to explain that if they hadn't been humiliated into delivering the goods smoothly, they would have surely overpowered that madman! But they also gave another reason to justify their defeat: the burning thirst after loading the goods onto the truck had drained their strength, and there wasn't a single refreshment stand around here.</t3727> <t3728>I understood what they really wanted.</t3728> <t3729>So, after giving each of them two glasses of white wine mixed with lemon, sugar, and hot water, and slipping a gold coin into each of their hands, I didn't hear them mention anything about suing anymore.</t3729> <t3730>They even joked that one day they would be ready to fight another madman, even one much fiercer.</t3730> <t3731>I carefully noted down their names and addresses, because who knows, we might need them someday.</t3731> <t3732>All I wrote was this: Jack Smoliet, Dudding House, King George Street, Great Walworth; and Thomas Snelling, Peter Farley Row, Guide Court, Bethnal Green. These two guys are working at the Orange Masters Yard shipping company of Harris.</t3732>
<t3733>I will inform you thoroughly about all the important events happening here and will telegraph you as soon as there is any news.</t3733>
<t3734>Greetings, sir!</t3734>
<t3735>Patrick Hennesey.</t3735>
<t3736>Mina Harker sends Lucy Westenra</t3736>
<t3737>(The recipient has not opened the letter)</t3737>
<t3738>"September 18"</t3738>
<t3739>Lucy, I miss you.</t3739>
<t3740>We are going through a great misfortune.</t3740> <t3741>Sir Hawkins just suddenly passed away, making us feel like we have lost a real father.</t3741> <t3742>I feel this very clearly because I have never known my biological parents.</t3742> <t3743>As for Jonathan, the departure of a generous man who always considered him as a biological son has left him with an unending sorrow.</t3743> <t3744>So now the responsibility for all the work begins to fall on him, making him feel increasingly stressed and even, at times, he has shown self-doubt.</t3744> <t3745>However, I have tried my best to encourage him, and the faith I have placed in him has made him more confident.</t3745> <t3746>After all, this is the result of a terrible shock of which he is the victim.</t3746> <t3747>I still remember that Jonathan used to be a courageous and determined man - it was this very quality that convinced Hawkins when he decided to entrust him with the role of an assistant.</t3747> <t3748>It's hard to imagine that now he is so devastated! My dear friend, if what I have just said worries you and affects your happiness, please forgive me!</t3748> <t3749>But I have to confide in someone at this moment, because the more courageous and steadfast I appear in front of Jonathan, the more silently enduring this anxiety alone makes me fall apart.</t3749> <t3750>I'm afraid that the day after tomorrow - the day we have to bring Hawkins back to London to be buried beside his ancestors according to his last wish, I will not be able to stand firm if I cannot confide in you.</t3750> <t3751>Jonathan will be the one leading the funeral because he no longer has parents either.</t3751> <t3752>But no matter what, I will try to visit you, dear Lucy.</t3752> <t3753>Once again, please don't blame me for this bad news!</t3753>
<t3754>Wishing you a thousand times good luck?</t3754>
<t3755>Forever your great friend, Mina Harker.</t3755>
<t3756>Dr. Seward's Diary</t3756>
<t3757>• September 20</t3757>
<t3758>Tonight, I volunteered to stay alone, and as usual, I took out my journal to write.</t3758> <t3759>I feel unhappy, tired, and weak - as if I am weary of life and everyone - to the point that if I hear the sound of bats flapping their wings right now, I would think that Death is inviting me.</t3759> <t3760>Indeed, in the past few days, we have seen...</t3760> <t3761>First it was Lucy's mother, then Arthur's father, and now...</t3761> <t3762>But let me tell you...</t3762>
<t3763>At the appointed time, I watched over Lucy so that Van Helsing could rest for a while.</t3763> <t3764>Both the professor and I tried to persuade Arthur to take a break, but he stubbornly refused.</t3764> <t3765>However, when I explained to him that the next day we might very much need his help and that we shouldn't let ourselves get more tired just because of lack of sleep, he complied.</t3765> <t3766>Van Helsing also encouraged him:</t3766>
<t3767>— Come down and rest, young friend? The pain and sorrow might have already exhausted you, don't let it get worse.</t3767> <t3768>You shouldn't stay alone, because loneliness might make you suffer even more.</t3768> <t3769>Come down to the living room with me, there's already a fireplace and two couches down there.</t3769> <t3770>The two of us will each take a couch instead of a bed.</t3770> <t3771>I'll pull my couch closer to yours, we need to be near each other to comfort one another during this time, even if we both fall asleep and don't say anything, that's fine too.</t3771>
<t3772>Arthur painfully stood watching Lucy for a long time, then quietly followed Van Helsing down the stairs.</t3772> <t3773>Lucy remained motionless on the bed.</t3773> <t3774>Glancing around the room, I noticed the professor continued to use garlic flowers: he had rubbed garlic flowers on all the windows of the rooms, filling the place with the pungent smell of this unpleasant plant.</t3774> <t3775>He also quickly wove the garlic flowers into Lucy's handkerchief and wrapped it around her neck.</t3775> <t3776>Lucy had never shown such signs of pain.</t3776> <t3777>Occasionally, she would gasp with irregular breaths.</t3777> <t3778>She still slept with the same symptoms as before: mouth agape, gums purplish and receding, her teeth appearing longer and even sharper than in the morning, especially the canines, which seemed much longer and sharper than the others.</t3778> <t3779>As I sat down at the edge of the bed, she weakly stirred as if experiencing pain.</t3779> <t3780>That was also when something suddenly struck the windowpane hard.</t3780> <t3781>I cautiously approached the window, lifted a corner of the curtain, and looked outside.</t3781> <t3782>In the pale moonlight, I saw a large bat tirelessly flying back and forth as if mad, perhaps attracted by the faint light emanating from the bedroom.</t3782> <t3783>Occasionally, I saw it flap its wings and brush against the window glass.</t3783> <t3784>When I turned back to the bed, Lucy had slightly changed her lying position and had somehow pushed the garlic wreath off her neck without me noticing.</t3784> <t3785>I tried to arrange it back as it was.</t3785> <t3786>After lying for a while longer, she woke up.</t3786> <t3787>I tried to feed her a little as per Van Helsing's instructions, but she ate as if enduring a torture!</t3787> <t3788>Despite the fact that even her unconscious instinctive strength had now abandoned her, it seemed there was still something urging her to fight to the end against the illness and to conquer it at all costs.</t3788> <t3789>I was truly surprised to see that as soon as she woke up, she hurriedly clutched the garlic wreath.</t3789> <t3790>I found this very strange: every time she fell into a deep sleep, making her breathing very labored, she would push the wreath away.</t3790> <t3791>Conversely, every time she woke up or was about to wake up, I saw her clutch the wreath tightly to herself.</t3791> <t3792>There was one more thing I couldn't mistake: in the hours that followed, I saw her wake up and then fall back into a deep sleep many times, and this kept happening with the same actions from her.</t3792>
<t3793>At six o'clock in the evening, Van Helsing came to take over my shift.</t3793> <t3794>Arthur had fallen asleep, so he didn't have the heart to wake him up.</t3794> <t3795>He looked at Lucy and couldn't help but sigh.</t3795> <t3796>After a while, he turned to me and said, in a very soft yet very clear voice:</t3796>
<t3797>— Pull up the curtain for me! I want some light!</t3797>
<t3798>He bent down to remove the garlic wreath from Lucy's neck to check on the patient's condition.</t3798> <t3799>The choking sound in his throat startled me: "Oh God!" I silently bent down with him, and what met my eyes made me shudder and tremble: the wounds on her neck had completely disappeared.</t3799>
<t3800>Van Helsing was stunned for a moment, his face showing more resignation and seriousness than ever before.</t3800> <t3801>About five minutes later, he turned to me and said:</t3801>
<t3802>— The girl is dying, everything will probably end soon.</t3802> <t3803>But listen to me, whether she dies in her sleep or not, it makes no difference.</t3803> <t3804>Go wake Arthur up so he can see his beloved one last time.</t3804> <t3805>He is waiting for us to wake him because I promised him that.</t3805>
<t3806>I was shocked and ran down to call Arthur.</t3806> <t3807>It took him a while to regain his composure after a deep sleep.</t3807> <t3808>At first, I had to lie to him that Lucy was still sleeping, but gradually I had to confess that both Professor Van Helsing and I were very afraid of a tragic end approaching.</t3808> <t3809>Arthur felt as if the sky was about to collapse; he knelt down on the chair, his hands covering his face, his shoulders shaking violently with sobs.</t3809> <t3810>He remained kneeling like that, praying for many minutes.</t3810> <t3811>I had to take his hand and pull him up.</t3811>
<t3812>— Come on, my friend, - I said - be brave, you must be brave for her.</t3812>
<t3813>Returning to Lucy's room, I saw Van Helsing still trying to appear normal, if not even more cheerful than usual.</t3813> <t3814>He even took a comb to brush the silky hair that lay scattered on the girl's pillow.</t3814>
<t3815>As we just stepped in, she opened her eyes.</t3815> <t3816>Seeing her fiancé, she softly whispered:</t3816>
<t3817>— Arthur! My love! It is so wonderful to see you here!</t3817>
<t3818>Arthur bent down, intending to embrace the girl, but Van Helsing managed to stop him in time:</t3818>
<t3819>— Don't, don't do that, it's not the right time yet. Just hold her hand, that might comfort her even more!</t3819>
<t3820>Arthur reluctantly held his fiancée's hand and knelt beside her bed.</t3820> <t3821>No matter what, she still looked very beautiful; the gentle features on her delicate face harmonized perfectly with the angelic beauty of her eyes.</t3821> <t3822>Her eyelashes slowly closed, leading her into a new sleep.</t3822> <t3823>At times, I saw her chest rise and then slowly fall again; watching her breathe, I felt like I was looking at a sick child.</t3823>
<t3824>The abnormal change that I had noticed in her during the previous hours began to reappear: labored breathing with interrupted breaths, mouth agape revealing two rows of pale gums along with long and sharp teeth.</t3824>
<t3825>She opened her eyes in a near-unconscious state, within those eyes was an endless sorrow mixed with hopeless pain, only her voice remained the same, gentle and filled with love:</t3825>
<t3826>— Arthur! - She repeated the previous words - Oh! My love!</t3826> <t3827>I am so happy to see you by my side again?</t3827> <t3828>Kiss me?</t3828>
<t3829>Just waiting for that, Arthur immediately rushed forward to embrace his fiancée, but once again, Van Helsing and I had to stop him.</t3829> <t3830>Van Helsing grabbed Arthur's shoulders firmly and pushed him back almost to the end of the room; indeed, I had never thought he was that strong.</t3830>
<t3831>— Poor fellow, don't do that! - He softly exclaimed - Never do that, you must care for her and care for yourself!</t3831>
<t3832>Arthur could only stand frozen in place, his face showing a dazed and pained expression as if he were awaiting the worst to come.</t3832> <t3833>Van Helsing and I did not dare take our eyes off Lucy for even a minute.</t3833> <t3834>We noticed that her face seemed to start showing the initial signs of convulsions.</t3834> <t3835>Then, her sharp teeth suddenly gaped open and then snapped shut with a dry and horrifying sound.</t3835> <t3836>I had the feeling that she had just bitten something.</t3836> <t3837>Then her eyes slowly closed, and as before, her breathing began to grow more labored.</t3837>
<t3838>But just a few minutes later, she opened her eyes again, still with a gentle look on her sorrowful face.</t3838> <t3839>She laboriously raised her pale but thin hand to grasp Van Helsing's hand and gently kissed it.</t3839>
<t3840>— My dear old friend. - She sobbed, speaking in a weak and trembling voice as if she could no longer contain the indescribable emotions within her.</t3840> <t3841>- My kind old friend, who is also his kind old friend! Oh! Please take care of him for me, and just leave me be!</t3841>
<t3842>— Please rest assured, I promise you that. - The professor said as he knelt down beside the sickbed.</t3842>
<t3843>Then he turned to Arthur and said:</t3843>
<t3844>— Come here, my friend, take her hand and kiss her forehead, but remember, only once!</t3844>
<t3845>The engaged couple quietly exchanged glances instead of a kiss.</t3845> <t3846>Arthur did just that and then stepped back.</t3846>
<t3847>The girl's eyes slowly closed once more.</t3847> <t3848>Van Helsing held Arthur's hand, while his eyes remained fixed on the girl.</t3848>
<t3849>We suddenly heard groans escaping from the heaving chest of the girl, and then nothing more, not even a faint breath!</t3849>
<t3850>— It's over, - he muttered - everything is finished.</t3850>
<t3851>I heavily guided Arthur down to the living room, and as soon as we reached the armchair, he collapsed into it, covering his face with his hands and sobbing uncontrollably.</t3851> <t3852>Watching him shake with heart-wrenching sobs, I couldn't help but feel deeply moved.</t3852> <t3853>However, I still had to go meet Van Helsing.</t3853> <t3854>He was standing motionless, staring at the unfortunate girl, his face more sorrowful than ever.</t3854> <t3855>Yes, looking at Lucy, I felt as if death had cruelly returned her original beauty: her forehead, and even her cheeks, were now free of wrinkles, and even her lips had lost the pale color of a corpse.</t3855> <t3856>It seemed that when her heart stopped beating, the blood in her body had gathered to tint her lips a rosy hue, removing the dreadful pallor of a corpse. "So when the girl was sleeping, we thought she was dead; and now, when she is dead, we think she is sleeping."</t3856> <t3857>I thought to myself, feeling a deep, bitter sorrow.</t3857>
<t3858>I approached Van Helsing and whispered softly as if afraid of waking the little girl:</t3858>
<t3859>— Finally, the little girl found peace!</t3859> <t3860>All her suffering has come to an end.</t3860>
<t3861>— Oh God, no? - He turned to me and whispered.</t3861> <t3862>- Oh God, it's not like that! Those pains have only just begun.</t3862>
<t3863>I asked the professor what he said, I didn't understand; he shook his head and replied:</t3863>
<t3864>— It's still too early to act now.</t3864> <t3865>Let's just wait and see what happens!</t3865>
<t3866>CHAPTER 13</t3866>
<t3867>Dr. Seward's Diary</t3867>
<t3868>We decided to hold a funeral for both Lucy and her mother in two days.</t3868> <t3869>I was busy handling all the paperwork.</t3869> <t3870>The funeral home staff seemed very obedient to their boss, even the talkative old lady who specialized in washing the deceased was very enthusiastic about the funeral.</t3870> <t3871>When she stepped out of Lucy's room, she even confided in me with a very professional tone:</t3871>
<t3872>— You see, the girl died very beautifully, taking care of her at this moment is indeed a priority for us.</t3872> <t3873>It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that she will bring honor to our company!</t3873>
<t3874>During the entire time I was busy with work, Van Helsing did not step outside the door.</t3874> <t3875>None of us knew the relatives of the deceased.</t3875> <t3876>Moreover, tomorrow Arthur has to go home to arrange the funeral for his unfortunate father, so Van Helsing and I have to take care of all the funeral arrangements and review all the documents in the house.</t3876> <t3877>The professor is particularly interested in Lucy's documents.</t3877> <t3878>I don't understand why he is doing this, because as a foreigner, he probably doesn't fully understand the details of British Royal law, and his unfamiliarity might even cause us difficulties with the local authorities.</t3878>
<t3879>— You forgot that - He responded to my doubt - I am as good a doctor of law as I am a medical doctor.</t3879> <t3880>A few days ago, you were absolutely right when you said we need to avoid unnecessary troublesome investigations!</t3880> <t3881>Furthermore, the issue does not stop at the law but extends to other aspects as well.</t3881> <t3882>Who knows, we might even find documents, such as...</t3882>
<t3883>As he spoke, he pulled out a few sheets of paper from his notebook that Lucy always kept with her, the very sheets she had torn to pieces in her deep sleep.</t3883>
<t3884>— If you find Mrs. Westenra's notary, fill out everything and send him all the related documents.</t3884> <t3885>As for me, I will spend the night here or in Lucy's old room.</t3885> <t3886>I intend to look into a few more issues.</t3886>
<t3887>So, once again, I had to hurriedly run off to complete the task assigned by the professor.</t3887> <t3888>Half an hour later, I finally found the identity and address of the Westenra family's notary.</t3888> <t3889>All the documents of the poor woman had been fully prepared, especially her wishes regarding the organization of her funeral ceremony, which had been meticulously detailed.</t3889> <t3890>As I was arranging the documents, Professor Van Helsing entered the room.</t3890> <t3891>His question surprised me:</t3891>
<t3892>— Can I help you, my friend John? I don't know what else to do.</t3892> <t3893>If there's anything, just let me know and I'll lend a hand.</t3893>
<t3894>— But professor, have you found anything new yet?</t3894>
<t3895>— Couldn't find anything important.</t3895> <t3896>I hoped to discover something new, but in the end, it was just a few letters and a diary entry.</t3896> <t3897>I've got them all here, but for now, let's leave them as they are.</t3897> <t3898>Tomorrow evening, I'll meet that poor fellow and if permitted, we'll use those documents.</t3898> <t3899>My friend John, - the Professor continued after a brief pause - perhaps now we can go to sleep.</t3899> <t3900>You and I need to get some rest.</t3900> <t3901>Tomorrow will be a busy day, and for tonight, this is enough!</t3901>
<t3902>However, before going to bed, we did not forget to take a look at the room where little Lucy was resting.</t3902> <t3903>The room had been transformed by the funeral home staff into a small chapel filled with white wreaths.</t3903> <t3904>The atmosphere in the room seemed less heavy and cold.</t3904> <t3905>Lucy’s face was covered with a piece of white linen cloth.</t3905> <t3906>For some reason, Professor Van Helsing lifted that cloth.</t3906> <t3907>We were surprised to see the face of the deceased glowing under the flickering light of the candles.</t3907> <t3908>In death, Lucy suddenly returned to the pristine beauty she had before the day she fell into the mysterious illness.</t3908> <t3909>The hours that passed since she took her last breath seemed only to bring her back to the beauty she had when she was alive.</t3909> <t3910>She looked so beautiful that I couldn't help but doubt that I was standing before someone who had died.</t3910>
<t3911>The professor looks very deep in thought.</t3911> <t3912>He does not love the girl as I once did, and his eyes are not filled with tears like mine.</t3912>
<t3913>— Just wait for me here, - He told me - don't leave the room, you hear?</t3913>
<t3914>A moment later, he returned with a bunch of garlic flowers in his hand.</t3914> <t3915>These were the garlic flower stalks he had stored in an iron box placed in the hallway.</t3915> <t3916>He gently inserted each flower among the white flowers scattered throughout the room, especially around Lucy's bed.</t3916> <t3917>Then he lifted the small gold cross lying hidden under her collar, placed it on her lips, and gently covered her face with the cloth.</t3917> <t3918>We quietly stepped outside.</t3918>
<t3919>Back in the room, I hadn't had time to change clothes when I saw Van Helsing burst in, knocking on the door, and he told me:</t3919>
<t3920>— Tomorrow evening, I want you to bring me some autopsy tools.</t3920>
<t3921>— What? Do we have to perform an autopsy?</t3921>
<t3922>— Right, but not entirely so.</t3922> <t3923>It's true that I plan to perform surgery, but not in the way you might think.</t3923> <t3924>Let me explain, but you must absolutely keep it a secret, do you understand? I'm afraid we might have to decapitate her and even remove her heart.</t3924> <t3925>What? You're not shocked, are you, young surgeon? Haven't I seen you perform heart surgeries on patients in critical condition? Be brave, my friend John! Ah, yes!</t3925> <t3926>Forgive me! I shouldn't have forgotten that you love her too! So, I will perform the surgery myself, and you will only need to assist me.</t3926> <t3927>I planned to do it tonight, but obviously, that's not possible because Arthur is still here.</t3927> <t3928>Of course, tomorrow, after his father's burial, he will surely return to see his beloved once more.</t3928> <t3929>But once the coffin is sealed and everyone has gone to sleep, you and I will come back to open the coffin and proceed with the surgery.</t3929> <t3930>After that, we will restore everything as it was, as long as no one sees us.</t3930>
<t3931>— But let me ask honestly, why are we performing surgery?</t3931> <t3932>The poor girl is already dead, so why do we need to dissect the body without any reason?</t3932> <t3933>Performing surgery is pointless if it doesn't bring any practical benefit to the deceased, to us, to science, or even to human knowledge.</t3933> <t3934>So what problem are we solving by dissecting?</t3934> <t3935>Doing so is too cruel!</t3935>
<t3936>The professor gently patted my shoulder and replied in a voice just loud enough to be heard:</t3936>
<t3937>— My dear friend, I truly understand the sorrow in your heart and deeply sympathize with you.</t3937> <t3938>I know that doing so will only make your pain even more profound.</t3938> <t3939>I am also in great pain.</t3939> <t3940>But there are many things you don't know yet, and you will soon realize what I haven't wanted to say, even though they are all unpleasant things.</t3940> <t3941>John, many years have passed since you became a close friend of mine, so have you ever seen me do anything recklessly without a practical purpose?</t3941> <t3942>I may be mistaken, because after all, I am only human, but I always believe in what I do.</t3942> <t3943>Isn't that why you invited me here?</t3943> <t3944>Right! And wasn't it that you weren't surprised, or rather, you weren't shocked when you saw me prevent Arthur from kissing his fiancée when she was about to die and drag him away from that bed? Right!</t3944> <t3945>But you also saw the girl thank me with a weak voice and with her beautiful eyes that were about to close forever, while her lips kept kissing my old hand, didn't you? Right!</t3945> <t3946>Didn't you hear me swear to do exactly what she asked? Right!</t3946> <t3947>Therefore, now I have enough legitimate reasons to do what I want.</t3947> <t3948>Moreover, you have shown great trust in me all these years, and you have trusted me throughout the past few weeks full of strange events.</t3948> <t3949>Trust me a little longer, my dear friend John.</t3949> <t3950>If you don't, I will have to voice all my suspicions right now, but they are all things you don't want to hear.</t3950> <t3951>Furthermore, if I start the work without your complete trust, please note that whether you believe it or not, I still have to verify whether I am right or wrong, and I will certainly have to proceed with a heavy heart and an unavoidable sense of loneliness.</t3951> <t3952>Therefore, I really need your wholehearted help and courage!</t3952>
<t3953>He pondered for a moment and then continued:</t3953>
<t3954>— Believe me, my friend John, the most terrible days are still ahead of us.</t3954> <t3955>What I hope for now is that between the two of us, no matter what, only one of us is needed to smoothly carry out what needs to be done.</t3955>
<t3956>I quietly held his hand tightly as if to promise that I would place my complete trust in him just like the days that have passed.</t3956>
<t3957>I opened the door to see him off and stood watching until his figure completely disappeared into the room where he would sleep.</t3957> <t3958>Lost in thought, I suddenly jolted when I noticed a maid silently passing the landing and entering Lucy's room. The silent shadow of the servant truly moved me.</t3958> <t3959>She had bravely overcome all the fear and the chilling cold that a corpse could bring to the living, to take care of the coffin where her young mistress was resting, so that the poor body would not have to endure loneliness before departing to the eternal place.</t3959>
<t3960>Surely, I must have slept very long and deeply, because when Van Helsing entered the room to wake me up, it was already very bright outside.</t3960> <t3961>The professor walked over to the bed and told me, in a dejected voice:</t3961>
<t3962>— Don't bring the surgical tools anymore.</t3962> <t3963>I don't want to do it anymore.</t3963>
<t3964>— What's wrong? - I was astonished by his sudden change.</t3964>
<t3965>— Because, - as usual, his voice remained very serious after a series of incomprehensible events in recent days - because it was too late, or still too early!</t3965>
<t3966>— Look at this? - He said while showing me a small gold cross.</t3966> <t3967>- Last night, someone sneaked in and stole it.</t3967>
<t3968>— How could it be stolen?</t3968> <t3969>It's still right there in your hand!</t3969>
<t3970>— I reclaimed this cross from the hands of an unfortunate person, a woman who stole from both the living and the dead.</t3970> <t3971>Surely she will be punished, but I will not be involved in that matter.</t3971> <t3972>She does not know what she has done, she is merely the perpetrator of a theft.</t3972> <t3973>It's as simple as that!</t3973>
<t3974>After finishing his words, he quietly walked out.</t3974> <t3975>So many problems! I know that trying to unravel this new mystery would be futile.</t3975>
<t3976>This morning is so gloomy and dragging! However, by noon, the notary was also present: it was Marquand, a very kind-looking man from the Wholeman law office.</t3976> <t3977>He thanked us for everything we had done.</t3977> <t3978>All the final procedures and the smallest details would be completed by him according to his legal capacity.</t3978>
<t3979>At lunchtime, he reminded us that before she died, Mrs. Westenra had intended to settle all the family's affairs. He also informed us that since she could not transfer ownership to Lucy's father and no direct descendants of the family could be found, all her wealth and property would be left to Arthur Holmwood. The official tried to explain further:</t3979>
<t3980>— To be honest, we tried to prevent our client from including such terms in her will.</t3980> <t3981>We warned Mrs. Westenra that unforeseen events could leave her daughter penniless or hinder her decision-making on her wedding day.</t3981> <t3982>Things between us and the client got so bad that she angrily asked if we intended to respect her final wishes or not.</t3982> <t3983>Clearly, we had no choice but to silently accept.</t3983> <t3984>But in principle, we were ninety-nine percent right, because logically, we could prove the validity of our advice.</t3984> <t3985>However, I must admit that in this particular case, no other form of will could have fulfilled her wishes.</t3985> <t3986>Because logically, she would pass away before her daughter, and the daughter would inherit all the wealth and property.</t3986> <t3987>Yet the daughter only outlived her mother by a short time and left no will, as confirmed by the examination, so this can be considered a case of intestacy.</t3987> <t3988>Thus, Lord Godalming, although a very close friend and also the fiancé of the young lady, would have absolutely no claim.</t3988> <t3989>Perhaps the heirs, even those far away, would not yield to a stranger for sentimental reasons.</t3989> <t3990>They are the rightful returnees.</t3990> <t3991>Trust me, gentlemen, this is an argument that truly satisfies me.</t3991>
<t3992>Marquand must have been an excellent notary, but somehow he found joy in those details - the details that his profession always required him to pay attention to when the unfortunate were facing a tragedy.</t3992> <t3993>This is indeed a rigid and unsympathetic example that we often encounter in some people.</t3993>
<t3994>The notary only stayed with us for a moment before leaving with a promise to return in the afternoon to meet Lord Godalming.</t3994> <t3995>In any case, his presence somewhat comforted us, as he gave us a sense of reassurance about what we had done since Mrs. Westenra and Miss Lucy passed away.</t3995>
<t3996>We waited for Arthur until five in the afternoon.</t3996> <t3997>A little before that, we were still in the funeral home.</t3997> <t3998>I call it that because now both Mrs. Westenra and her daughter are resting there.</t3998> <t3999>The funeral home staff seemed more enthusiastic than usual today.</t3999> <t4000>The sorrowful atmosphere in the small room plunged us into an unbearable feeling of numbness.</t4000> <t4001>Van Helsing requested the funeral home staff to restore everything in the room to its previous state.</t4001> <t4002>He said that Lord Godalming was about to arrive, and seeing only his fiancée here would make it less painful for him.</t4002>
<t4003>The funeral home employee pretended to be remorseful for his foolish actions and then immediately got to work as requested by the professor.</t4003> <t4004>When Arthur arrived, the room had been restored to its original state as we had done the night before going to bed.</t4004>
<t4005>Poor Arthur! In a state of utter despair from successive pains, it seemed he was no longer himself.</t4005> <t4006>I understand he loved his father very much.</t4006> <t4007>Losing his father at this moment was like a bolt from the blue.</t4007> <t4008>He has shown me what friendship is and to Van Helsing, he always presented himself as a polite and strong person, but it seems to me that the pain has turned him into someone almost completely losing self-control.</t4008> <t4009>Surely the professor felt the same as I did, as he just gestured for me to join the poor young man.</t4009> <t4010>I did not intend to follow the professor's suggestion because I thought that perhaps Arthur only wanted to be alone with his fiancée Lucy at this moment.</t4010> <t4011>But when he saw me about to step out of the door, he hurriedly grabbed my hand and pulled me in.</t4011>
<t4012>— You love her too, my friend. - He said chokingly.</t4012> <t4013>- She told me everything, among her friends, she has no one closer than you.</t4013> <t4014>I really don't know how to thank you for what you've done for her.</t4014> <t4015>Even now, I still can't...</t4015>
<t4016>Arthur suddenly burst into tears with incessant sobs, he threw his arms around my shoulders and sobbed:</t4016>
<t4017>— Oh my God? Jack, Jack?</t4017> <t4018>What will happen to me now?</t4018> <t4019>Everything is lost, what is there left for me to live for?</t4019>
<t4020>Even though I knew that any words at this moment would be useless, I still tried to find the right words to comfort him.</t4020> <t4021>One hand tightly grasping his, the other placed on the trembling shoulder of a shattered soul, a sob that couldn't be held back mingling with the mournful sobs, that was all my heart told me to do to share and soothe my grieving friend.</t4021> <t4022>Waiting for his sobs to gradually subside, I finally dared to gently remind him:</t4022>
<t4023>— Come on, let's go visit her!</t4023>
<t4024>We approached the bed of the deceased and gently lifted the cloth covering the face to one side.</t4024> <t4025>Oh Lord, how beautiful she is! It seems as though with each passing hour, she becomes more beautiful than before.</t4025> <t4026>This not only surprised me but also made me feel scared.</t4026> <t4027>As for Arthur, it seemed to me that doubt and sorrow had driven him mad, and he began to tremble violently like someone with malaria.</t4027> <t4028>Finally, after a moment of silence, he leaned into my ear and whispered:</t4028>
<t4029>— Jack, is it true that she has died?</t4029>
<t4030>I am compelled to affirm to you the misfortune of the young girl, because I know that your feeling of doubt, no matter what, can only last for a moment.</t4030> <t4031>I explain so that you understand that usually, after a person dies, the features on their face will bear a gentle expression that faintly recalls their youthful appearance, and this is even more evident in those who have endured extreme prolonged suffering before death.</t4031> <t4032>It seems that my explanation has convinced you.</t4032> <t4033>After a long time kneeling by the bed, staring blankly at his fiancée, he decided to stand up and step outside.</t4033> <t4034>I had to tell him that it was time to say a final farewell to the young girl, as they were about to place her in the coffin.</t4034> <t4035>Hearing this, he sobbed, turned back, tightly grasped his beloved's small hand, placed it on his lips, and bitterly bent down to kiss her forehead.</t4035> <t4036>With great effort, he managed to drag his feet out of the room, but his head still turned back to look at her beloved form one last time, until her figure disappeared from sight.</t4036>
<t4037>I helped him back to rest in the living room and then hurriedly went to find Van Helsing, who was instructing the funeral home staff to prepare the coffins for the unfortunate people.</t4037>
<t4038>I recounted to the professor how Arthur had wondered about the appearance of his fiancée.</t4038>
<t4039>— That doesn't surprise me at all. - He told me. - There was a time when I didn't believe my own eyes either!</t4039>
<t4040>During dinner, I noticed that Arthur was making a great effort to hide his heart-wrenching pain.</t4040> <t4041>Van Helsing just sat quietly, and it wasn't until we were lighting our cigarettes that he spoke to Arthur:</t4041>
<t4042>— My lord...</t4042>
<t4043>— No, don't call me that, for God's sake! - Arthur interrupted - No matter what, don't call me that! I'm sorry, sir, I didn't mean to offend you.</t4043> <t4044>But please understand and believe me, my family's funeral just recently...</t4044>
<t4045>Van Helsing responded in a noticeably subdued tone:</t4045>
<t4046>— I call you that simply because I don't know how to address you properly.</t4046> <t4047>In fact, I don't like calling you "sir," because up until now, I have been very, very fond of you, young man.</t4047> <t4048>To me, you are always Arthur.</t4048>
<t4049>Arthur respectfully extended his hand towards the elderly doctor:</t4049>
<t4050>— Please feel free to give me any name you like, but whatever name it is, I hope you always consider me a friend.</t4050> <t4051>To be honest, there have been many times I wanted to express my gratitude to you but didn't know how to articulate it.</t4051> <t4052>You have been wholeheartedly dedicated to my loved one! - Arthur paused for a moment and then continued - I know she will understand your sentiments better than I do, if at this moment I don't know how to behave properly then...</t4052> <t4053>Please forgive me.</t4053>
<t4054>Van Helsing's answer once again demonstrates his genuine empathy.</t4054>
<t4055>— I know! - His voice was steady and slow - It is very difficult for you to understand and completely trust me, because to trust each other, first people must understand each other.</t4055> <t4056>I believe that you have not, or more accurately, have not yet trusted me, because you do not understand me.</t4056> <t4057>However, there are still situations where I very much need your trust, but you do not understand or cannot yet understand! But as time goes by, eventually you will fully trust me, when you understand everything as clear as day.</t4057> <t4058>Then you will certainly wish me well for the actions I have taken for your benefit, for the benefit of others, and for the poor child whom I have sworn to protect to the utmost.</t4058>
<t4059>— Yes, of course, - Athur replied - I will completely entrust myself to you.</t4059> <t4060>I know you carry a chivalrous heart, and you are a friend of Jack just as you and Jack are friends of hers. You will act according to the duty you believe is yours.</t4060>
<t4061>After a moment of contemplation, Van Helsing pensively continued:</t4061>
<t4062>— Can I ask you a question?</t4062>
<t4063>— Of course, that's fine.</t4063>
<t4064>— Do you know that Mrs. Westenra has left you all the assets she had?</t4064>
<t4065>— No.</t4065> <t4066>Poor woman! No...</t4066> <t4067>I never thought about that.</t4067>
<t4068>— Now all of that property belongs to you, so you have the right to use it as you wish.</t4068> <t4069>I intend to ask your permission to read all of Lucy's papers and letters.</t4069> <t4070>Don't doubt it, it's not because I'm curious.</t4070> <t4071>I'm doing this for a reason that I know she would agree with.</t4071> <t4072>I've found the papers and letters.</t4072> <t4073>Currently, I'm holding all of them before returning them to you as a part of her legacy.</t4073> <t4074>I will read everything if you allow, and if you haven't seen these mementos yet, it would be better at this moment - I will keep them in a safe place.</t4074> <t4075>I assure you that I won't lose a single piece of her papers.</t4075> <t4076>At an appropriate time, I will return everything to you.</t4076> <t4077>Perhaps I'm asking for too much, but I know that out of love for Lucy, you will agree, won't you, my friend?</t4077>
<t4078>Without much thought, Arthur immediately replied in a straightforward and sincere manner, just as I knew him to be:</t4078>
<t4079>— Doctor Van Helsing, please do as you wish.</t4079> <t4080>I know that if Lucy were still here, she would testify to what I am saying.</t4080> <t4081>I will not ask any questions until you feel it is time to explain your actions.</t4081>
<t4082>— You are absolutely right. - The professor jumped up and spoke in a very serious tone.</t4082> <t4083>- We all have a lot of work to do and quite a few concerns, but it's not just the concerns; behind them, we have many other issues to understand.</t4083> <t4084>Dr. Seward and I, and you too, Arthur, you and no one else, the three of us will have to endure bitter moments before returning to a peaceful life.</t4084> <t4085>We must be brave, not thinking about ourselves but prioritizing our duties first; only then can we succeed!</t4085>
<t4086>That night, I slept on the settee in Arthur's room. Van Helsing did not rest at all.</t4086> <t4087>He kept pacing back and forth as if patrolling the house, but never strayed far from the room where Lucy's coffin was placed.</t4087> <t4088>Unlike the scent of lilies or roses, the scattered garlic flowers in the room emitted a pungent odor throughout the night.</t4088>
<t4089>Mina Harker's Diary</t4089>
<t4090>• September 22</t4090>
<t4091>I am sitting and writing on the train that is taking us to Exeter.</t4091> <t4092>Jonathan is fast asleep.</t4092>
<t4093>It seems to me that I only started writing these diary entries yesterday, yet so many things have happened since we were in Whitby to plan for the future, while Jonathan was wandering in a foreign land and I was always eagerly waiting for news from him.</t4093> <t4094>Time flies, and now I am married to Jonathan, a notary, the owner of his own law office.</t4094> <t4095>Mr. Hawkins has been properly buried, and Jonathan has just gone through a new illness that makes me worry about the potentially unfavorable consequences that may occur later.</t4095> <t4096>There may come a day when he asks me about the things that happened while he was not conscious of them.</t4096> <t4097>I suddenly realize that my shorthand writing skills have deteriorated, perhaps I should take the time to practice them again occasionally...</t4097>
<t4098>The funeral was held simply but also very emotionally.</t4098> <t4099>There were only the two of us, a few servants, and two or three old friends from Exeter, a staff member from London, and another gentleman who introduced himself as John Paxton, the president of a general law firm.</t4099> <t4100>Jonathan and I held each other's hands tightly, feeling empty inside knowing for sure that our best, closest friend had gone away and would never return...</t4100>
<t4101>To get back to the city, we had to take a bus and get off at the Hyde Park stop.</t4101> <t4102>To ease my sadness, Jonathan invited me to stroll along a small path in the park, but I couldn't walk much, so the two of us found a place to sit and rest.</t4102> <t4103>There were very few people in the park, and all the benches were completely empty.</t4103> <t4104>The melancholy scene here made me unconsciously think of the empty chair we would see again when we returned home.</t4104> <t4105>So we didn't sit for long, I stood up and pulled Jonathan towards Piccadilly.</t4105> <t4106>Jonathan linked arms with me as he used to do in the past, back when he would take me to school.</t4106> <t4107>To be honest, I naturally felt that his gesture at this moment made me a bit uncomfortable.</t4107> <t4108>But now Jonathan is my husband, and besides, we didn't know anyone among the passersby, and even if a few of them recognized us, it wouldn't matter at all.</t4108> <t4109>We continued to walk straight ahead...</t4109> <t4110>I suddenly noticed a very beautiful young girl, wearing a wide-brimmed hat, sitting in a Victoria-style carriage parked in front of Guillano's house.</t4110> <t4111>But Jonathan startled me by suddenly squeezing my hand so tightly it hurt.</t4111> <t4112>I suddenly felt worried when he leaned into my ear and said in a choked voice: "My God!" So many unlucky days had passed that I couldn't help but worry about him, because I was always afraid he would fall into a new episode that would unbalance his nervous system.</t4112> <t4113>I quickly turned to ask what had happened.</t4113>
<t4114>For some reason, his face suddenly turned pale as if there wasn't a drop of blood left, and his eyes seemed to bulge out with bloodshot veins.</t4114> <t4115>It seemed like he was paying attention to a tall, skinny man with a hooked nose like a hawk's, a black mustache, and a long, sharp beard in front of him.</t4115> <t4116>And that man was also staring intently at the young girl.</t4116> <t4117>He was so engrossed in looking at the girl that he didn't notice anyone around him, allowing me to comfortably observe him.</t4117> <t4118>His face truly didn't convey anything good.</t4118> <t4119>It looked stiff, rough, and filled with lust, with the most frightening part being his large, white horse-like teeth.</t4119> <t4120>Between his lips, red as chili peppers,</t4120><t4121>those teeth appeared as sharp as those of a wild animal.</t4121> <t4122>Jonathan still stared blankly at the strange man.</t4122> <t4123>Suddenly, I felt afraid of him, because he indeed had something very suspicious about him.</t4123> <t4124>When I asked why he was so dazed, Jonathan responded as if I had known everything all along:</t4124>
<t4125>— Do you know him?</t4125>
<t4126>— No, how would I know!</t4126> <t4127>Who is it?</t4127>
<t4128>Your answer really shocked me.</t4128> <t4129>Listening to your voice, I felt like you no longer knew who I was:</t4129>
<t4130>— It's really him...</t4130> <t4131>It's really him!</t4131>
<t4132>Clearly, my dear husband was terrified, or more precisely, he was utterly petrified by something.</t4132> <t4133>I believe that if he hadn't leaned on me, he would have surely collapsed to the ground.</t4133> <t4134>He seemed to be hypnotized by a man who was completely unfamiliar to me.</t4134> <t4135>Suddenly, a man stepped out of a shop, walked towards the young girl, and handed her a package.</t4135> <t4136>The stranger continued to stare intently at the girl.</t4136> <t4137>When the car started moving in the opposite direction towards Piccadilly, he hurriedly called for a cab to chase after it.</t4137> <t4138>Jonathan continued to stare blankly, and after a moment, he mumbled as if speaking to himself:</t4138>
<t4139>— That's right, I'm sure it was the old count, but he seems to look younger, doesn't he?</t4139> <t4140>My God! If that was him...</t4140> <t4141>Oh! My God, My God! If only I knew, if only...</t4141>
<t4142>I had to restrain myself from asking any questions, because I feared that if I did otherwise, I would remind him of thoughts that would make him suffer as if being tortured.</t4142> <t4143>So I had to keep silent and lead him to continue walking towards a garden named Green Campus. The autumn weather today was unbearably hot, and we had to find a stone bench under a dense bush to sit and rest.</t4143> <t4144>Jonathan stared blankly into the distance like a lost soul, but he could only sit for a moment before leaning his head on my shoulder, his eyes tightly closed, as he drifted into a peaceful sleep.</t4144> <t4145>I suddenly felt happy seeing him sleep.</t4145> <t4146>Clearly, he was no longer tormented by his illness as before.</t4146> <t4147>About twenty minutes later, he woke up and spoke to me in a very cheerful voice:</t4147>
<t4148>— Mina! So I finally got some sleep.</t4148> <t4149>Oh! Sorry, my love...</t4149> <t4150>Come on, let's find a place to have some tea.</t4150>
<t4151>I understand that you have completely forgotten our meeting with that strange man, and in your pathological state, you have also forgotten all the memories that meeting evoked in you.</t4151> <t4152>But even so, I still do not dare to ask any questions, because I am certain that doing so would only cause unforeseeable harmful consequences rather than a good result.</t4152> <t4153>However, no matter what, I must find out about your recent journey abroad.</t4153> <t4154>Perhaps it is time for me to untie the blue ribbon binding your notebook.</t4154> <t4155>Oh, Jonathan, please forgive me!</t4155> <t4156>I always understand what I am doing, I will have to read what you wrote in that notebook.</t4156> <t4157>If I do so, it is only because of you.</t4157>
<t4158>• A moment later</t4158>
<t4159>A sorrowful return home not just for one reason.</t4159> <t4160>Indeed, so many things! Jonathan still looked as pale as a truly sick person.</t4160> <t4161>Moreover, there was a telegram from a certain Mr. Van Helsing waiting for us:</t4161>
<t4162>“I deeply regret to inform you about the sudden death of Mrs. Westenra five days ago and the death of her daughter Lucy the day before yesterday.</t4162> <t4163>Both have been properly buried today.”</t4163>
<t4164>Oh my God? How can just a few lines contain so much sorrow?</t4164> <t4165>Poor Mrs. Westenra?</t4165> <t4166>Poor Lucy! So they have gone, gone forever! Poor, poor Arthur, life for him now is nothing but a miserable and dull existence! May God help us overcome this pain?</t4166>
<t4167>Dr. Seward's Diary</t4167>
<t4168>• September 22</t4168>
<t4169>Everything is done.</t4169><t4170>Arthur returned to Ring with Quincey Morris.</t4170><t4171>Quincey is indeed a very likable young man.</t4171><t4172>He was as grieved by Lucy's death as any of us, yet he knew how to maintain a calm demeanor with the courage of a Norse pirate. If America continues to produce men like him, it will soon become a world power.</t4172><t4173>As for Van Helsing, he took a bit of rest before heading back home.</t4173><t4174>He had to return to Amsterdam to handle some personal matters.</t4174><t4175>However, he planned to go to London tomorrow evening and stay there if possible to deal with a rather time-consuming matter.</t4175><t4176>To be honest, I still worry that his enduring stamina may not last as long as it used to.</t4176><t4177>At the funeral, I noticed he showed some slightly unusual signs.</t4177><t4178>When the work was done, we gathered around Arthur as he emotionally spoke about the blood he had given to Lucy.</t4178><t4179>I saw Van Helsing's face turn from pale to crimson.</t4179><t4180>Arthur said that since he gave his blood to Lucy, he felt she had truly become his wife in the eyes of God. Of course, we were not foolish enough to mention the other blood transfusions that Arthur did not know about, and we would certainly never reveal that.</t4180><t4181>Arthur and Quincey led each other to the station, while Van Helsing and I returned here.</t4181><t4182>We had just gotten into the carriage when the professor suddenly had a seizure, I mean his nerves were extremely agitated.</t4182><t4183>But later, he firmly denied this agitation.</t4183><t4184>He explained that it was merely a humorous feeling after all the terrible events that had occurred.</t4184><t4185>He laughed, laughed until he cried, laughed so hard that I had to lower all the curtains around the carriage so that outsiders wouldn't see him in such an abnormal state, and then he cried, truly cried, like a child.</t4185><t4186>After that, I had to witness him laugh again, laughing hysterically.</t4186><t4187>Finally, he was both laughing and crying, crying bitterly like a woman, or rather like a madman.</t4187><t4188>I tried my best to comfort and soothe him, even sternly told him to stay calm, but all my efforts were in vain.</t4188><t4189>So I let him be mad, until he got tired of it.</t4189><t4190>In similar situations, women often react differently than men.</t4190><t4191>Finally, when his face returned to its usual serious and important look, I dared to ask what had made him laugh in such a sad moment.</t4191>
<t4192>He answered quite logically, but also as incomprehensibly as he himself is.</t4192>
<t4193>— Ah! My friend John, you still don't understand me! Don't think that just because I laugh, I'm not sad.</t4193><t4194>I have cried even when I was forced to laugh out loud!</t4194><t4195>But don't believe that I only express sadness when I cry.</t4195><t4196>Never forget the laughter that comes knocking at your door and asks: "May I come in?" That is not genuine laughter.</t4196><t4197>Never! That laughter is a king, it comes to your house when it sees your house is happy in its own way!</t4197><t4198>It doesn't need anyone's permission, only joy matters to it.</t4198><t4199>For example, day and night I am tormented by that gentle young girl, even though I am old and tired, I still intend to donate blood to save her.</t4199><t4200>I still devote my time, knowledge, and even my sleep to her.</t4200><t4201>I have neglected my other patients to give everything to her.</t4201><t4202>That's it!</t4202><t4203>Yet in just a moment, I burst out laughing right in front of her grave, laughing continuously, making my face flush red.</t4203><t4204>That's not all.</t4204><t4205>My heart also tightened when I thought of that poor young man - a young man about the age of my son if I had been fortunate enough to keep him; how their eyes, noses, and hair are so similar, I don't know!</t4205><t4206>Now you understand why I cherish that young man so much, don't you? Even so, when he talked to us about the marital love he never once enjoyed, he moved me and left a strange attraction in my paternal heart that I had never experienced with my students.</t4206><t4207>Of course, the same goes for you, my friend John, because everything we have done and lived through together has only brought us a more equal relationship rather than a father-son bond.</t4207><t4208>I repeat, even so, the King of Laughter still comes and shouts in my ear: "Here I am, I have arrived!", so loudly that I feel a surge of blood rushing through me, making my face flush red like the sun.</t4208><t4209>That's it, my friend, our world is truly strange! A world of boredom, hardship, misfortune, and always full of worries.</t4209><t4210>However, when the King of Laughter arrives, everyone starts dancing together in the atmosphere that he always finds satisfying!</t4210><t4211>Bleeding hearts, skeletons lying in the cemetery, burning tears on cheeks, all suddenly join in dancing together to the music emanating from the mouth of the King of Laughter. Believe me, my friend, we will have to be grateful to him!</t4211><t4212>Because we, men and women alike, can be compared to strings stretched at both ends, and then there are tears falling, like raindrops on each key, suddenly making us tense up until, at some point, the tension becomes truly unbearable, and we snap.</t4212><t4213>Right at that boundary, the King of Laughter suddenly appears like a ray of sunshine, loosening the string, and we can continue our work regardless of our current state.</t4213>
<t4214>I did not intend to hurt the professor when I confessed to him that I did not understand anything about his philosophy.</t4214> <t4215>Although he had explained, I still could not determine the reason why he laughed so uproariously.</t4215> <t4216>I was forced to frankly admit to him about my lack of wisdom.</t4216>
<t4217>— Oh dear! - He continued to explain.</t4217> <t4218>- It was nothing more than the most tragic irony!</t4218> <t4219>The gentle girl lay quietly among the pure white flowers.</t4219> <t4220>She was as beautiful as life itself, so beautiful that each of us had to ask ourselves if she was truly dead or not.</t4220> <t4221>Now the girl is peacefully resting for eternity under a stone grave in a distant cemetery, where her dearest loved ones are also at rest.</t4221> <t4222>Oh God! How sad and mournful that funeral bell sounded! And the solemn priests reciting prayers in their white robes.</t4222> <t4223>And we all bowed our heads in reverence.</t4223> <t4224>Why is that? Isn't she already dead?</t4224>
<t4225>— But Professor, I still don't see anything funny in what you just said!</t4225> <t4226>In fact, I find your explanation increasingly convoluted.</t4226> <t4227>If there is something funny about the burial, is it possible that poor Arthur, a man falling into the depths of pain...</t4227>
<t4228>— Exactly! Didn't he say that the blood he donated to Lucy made her his wife?</t4228>
<t4229>— It is true that Arthur thought so, but that is something that would comfort him.</t4229>
<t4230>— Yes! But if that's the case, there will be trouble.</t4230> <t4231>Because if just giving blood makes Arthur feel that Lucy is his wife, then wouldn't that mean she is also our wife? Ha! Ha! So Lucy, sweet gentle Lucy, has many husbands.</t4231> <t4232>As for me, I could also say that I lost a dear wife, but the Church and heaven still have her.</t4232> <t4233>I have become a faithful husband to a wife who is no longer on this earth, making me a man with two wives!</t4233>
<t4234>— I still don't see anything funny! - I have to admit my confusion once again, - Because in fact, your remarks are still not interesting.</t4234>
<t4235>He patted my shoulder and continued his explanations:</t4235>
<t4236>— My friend John, I'm sorry if I gave you a headache.</t4236> <t4237>I don't have the habit of casually sharing my feelings with others, because it can easily hurt them.</t4237> <t4238>But with you, it's different, John.</t4238> <t4239>If only you could see everything happening deep in my heart when I'm laughing, or when laughter appears on my lips, if only you could see what continues to be hidden in my heart when the Lord of Laughter has taken off his crown and robe - for he will go very far, very far from me for a very, very long time - then surely among us, I would be the one you feel most sorry for.</t4239>
<t4240>— Why is that? - I asked, feeling truly moved when I heard him say the last sentence.</t4240> <t4241>- In short, I still don't understand your heart.</t4241>
<t4242>— Why? Because I know it is so!</t4242>
<t4243>Now we have said our goodbyes, each of us returning to the loneliness under our own cold roofs.</t4243> <t4244>So Lucy now rests in the family tomb, a silent grave nestled in an ancient cemetery, where the everyday sounds of London cannot reach, the atmosphere untouched by the dust of life, only graced by the golden rays of the sun gently descending from the Hampstead hilltop and the wildflowers scattered across the lush, velvet-like green grass.</t4244>
<t4245>So I can end these diary entries now.</t4245> <t4246>Only God knows when I will start another self-confession.</t4246> <t4247>If I have another chance like this, or if I continue these diary entries, I will surely write about different people or entirely different stories.</t4247> <t4248>After recording the entire story of my unrequited love and before returning to the life of work, I let out a sorrowful sigh that contained not a hint of hope.</t4248>
<t4249>Westminster Gazette, September 25</t4249>
<t4250>A mystery in Hampstead</t4250>
<t4251>The surrounding areas of Hampstead are experiencing many events reminiscent of the incidents we once discussed in articles titled: The Horror in Kensington, or The Stabbed Woman, or The Woman in Black.</t4251> <t4252>Indeed, for the past two or three days, there has been much gossip about children disappearing from home, or more precisely, not being seen returning home after playing in the fields.</t4252>
<t4253>Granted, the children are too young to provide convincing explanations for their absences, but every time they return, they say they followed a "blood-stained woman."</t4253> <t4254>And every time, as soon as it gets dark, they are nowhere to be seen.</t4254> <t4255>Two of the missing children were only found at dawn the next day.</t4255> <t4256>When the first missing child returned home, they recounted that the "blood-stained woman" had lured them to go for a walk with her.</t4256> <t4257>Other cases also reported a similar story.</t4257> <t4258>We all know that children these days do not like to imitate each other, so the idea that they all lied and snuck out overnight is impossible.</t4258> <t4259>One of our correspondents reported that he saw some boys mimicking the mannerisms and gestures of the "blood-stained woman" in a very amusing way.</t4259> <t4260>If they wish, our cartoonists could learn a lot by watching these boys' imitations!</t4260>
<t4261>However, the matter does not seem to be without serious issues, as two of the children, that is, the children who ran away overnight, had small bites on their necks.</t4261> <t4262>It appears that these were bites from a large rat or a small dog.</t4262> <t4263>Although nothing serious has occurred yet, the wounds all indicate one thing: whether it is a rat or a dog, the animal always bites people in the same consistent manner.</t4263> <t4264>The police have received orders to monitor children who often play around Hampstead Heath or in the surrounding areas, especially the younger ones, and to also watch out for any dogs that may be wandering nearby.</t4264>
<t4265>Westminster Gazette, September 25</t4265>
<t4266>Special issue: The horror of Hampstead, another new victim.</t4266>
<t4267>We have just received news that yet another child went missing at dusk yesterday and was only found this morning in a gorse bush on Hunter's Hill, an area of Hampstead Heath that is less frequented than other areas.</t4267> <t4268>With a small bite mark on the neck identical to those of previous young victims, the boy was found in a weak and pale condition.</t4268> <t4269>After being brought home and calming down, the boy stated that he was also lured by the “blood-stained woman.”</t4269>

<t4271>Mina Harker's Diary</t4271>
<t4272>• September 23</t4272>
<t4273>After a restless night, today, Jonathan seems to be doing better.</t4273> <t4274>I feel happy to see him working more, because only then will he stop overthinking.</t4274> <t4275>Indeed, I felt quite uplifted seeing him busy with new tasks, because I know he will prove to be worthy and capable of handling new responsibilities, no matter what they are! He was out all day and instructed not to have lunch at home.</t4275> <t4276>After finishing some small household chores, I nervously returned to my room to read the pages of the diary he had written during his journey to Transylvania...</t4276>
<t4277>• September 24</t4277>
<t4278>Last night, I couldn't write a single line because Jonathan's diary had left me stunned.</t4278><t4279>Poor my husband! Whether it's true or just a figment of his imagination, he must have endured a lot of hardship.</t4279><t4280>One question always haunts my mind: Is there any part of that story that is true?</t4280><t4281>Did he describe those horrific things after suffering from brain fever, or is that illness the result of terrifying imaginations?</t4281><t4282>I'm afraid I won't find the answer, because I might never dare to bring up that matter with him.</t4282><t4283>But it seems that Jonathan recognized the man we saw yesterday...</t4283><t4284>Perhaps the sudden death of his great friend Hawkins has caused him many bizarre and vague hallucinations, that's all...</t4284><t4285>But it seems there is still a faint connection between the events that I can't quite grasp...</t4285><t4286>That suspicious Count seems to be carrying out a scheme in London. If it's true that he has come to London with millions of pounds, then surely this city is in a dire situation that no one but us can resolve.</t4286><t4287>We must not back down from this unavoidable task.</t4287><t4288>So there it is! I will have to start preparing right away, I will type up my husband's diary because that way, when needed, anyone involved can read and understand the matter.</t4288><t4289>I will explain the whole story myself, because I don't want anyone to disturb Jonathan.</t4289>
<t4290>Letter from Van Helsing to J.</t4290> <t4291>Harker</t4291>
<t4292>"September 24"</t4292>
<t4293>Dear esteemed lady,</t4293>
<t4294>I sincerely apologize for the suddenness of sending you this letter, but in fact, I am somewhat of a friend to you, as I bear the difficult duty of informing you about the death of Miss Lucy Westenra.</t4294> <t4295>With the wholehearted consent of Lord Godalming, I have read all of Lucy's papers and letters, as I am very concerned about some extremely important matters related to her.</t4295> <t4296>Among the documents obtained, I found your letters, which reflect the noble friendship that you and she shared.</t4296> <t4297>My God! Mrs. Mina, in the name of that pure friendship, I beg you to help me! For the sake of everyone, I boldly ask you... to mend the pains caused by crime, to prevent the most terrible misfortunes, which even the most imaginative person could not conceive.</t4297> <t4298>Could you spare some precious time to meet with me? I believe you can trust me.</t4298> <t4299>I am a friend of Dr. John Seward and also a friend of Lord Godalming (that is, Arthur of Miss Lucy, as you know).</t4299> <t4300>But once again, I must apologize because I cannot yet say what I need to ask, at least not at this moment.</t4300> <t4301>I will come to Exeter to visit you as soon as you inform me of the most suitable date and time.</t4301> <t4302>I hope you will forgive my abruptness, madam!</t4302> <t4303>Through the letters you sent to Lucy, I understand how kind-hearted you are, and I also understand how your beloved husband is struggling with his nervous illness!</t4303> <t4304>If possible, I suggest you do not let him know about this matter, as I fear that what I have to say to you will negatively affect his health.</t4304> <t4305>Once again, I ask for your forgiveness.</t4305>

<t4309>September 25</t4309>

<t4313>Mina Harker's Diary</t4313>
<t4314>• September 25</t4314>
<t4315>I really can't sit still while waiting for Dr. Van Helsing.</t4315> <t4316>I don't know why I'm so anxious, but I understand one thing very clearly: he might shed some light on the sorrowful truth that Jonathan had to endure.</t4316> <t4317>Moreover, as the doctor who has been directly caring for Lucy over the past few days, he will surely tell me what he has perceived about her illness.</t4317> <t4318>Oh! I am truly a fool!</t4318> <t4319>Perhaps Van Helsing is coming here just to tell me about Lucy and her sleepwalking, not to talk about Jonathan.</t4319> <t4320>So I can only resign myself to never knowing the full truth about his journey.</t4320> <t4321>His diary haunts me so much that I have imagined all sorts of things, and I even foolishly hoped for Van Helsing's help! Clearly, he is here to talk to me about Lucy! Surely, she has had new episodes of sleepwalking recently.</t4321> <t4322>And perhaps the sleepwalking to the cold cliff in the dead of night—a truly terrifying memory for me!—has made her seriously ill.</t4322> <t4323>Indeed, over the past few days, being so busy with my own affairs, I completely forgot that she always has troubles that we cannot help but worry about!</t4323> <t4324>Surely Lucy has told Van Helsing about how she sleepwalked to that precarious cliff and how I frantically ran to find her.</t4324> <t4325>Perhaps Van Helsing intends to come here to ask for additional details to supplement his medical records.</t4325> <t4326>I hope I did the right thing by not telling Mrs. Westenra about her daughter's terrifying night.</t4326> <t4327>I would never forgive myself if Lucy's health deteriorated because of that.</t4327> <t4328>I also hope Dr. Van Helsing does not resent me for what I have done.</t4328> <t4329>Anyway, over the past time, I have had so many troubles that sometimes I felt I couldn't bear it, but in the end, I still had to overcome it! Surely, Lucy has cried a lot.</t4329> <t4330>I hope that her tears have somewhat alleviated her sorrow and pain in these last days...</t4330>
<t4331>This morning, Jonathan had to temporarily leave me, he will only return tomorrow morning.</t4331> <t4332>Since we got married, this is the first time we have been apart for so long.</t4332> <t4333>I hope he takes care of his health and pray that he does not encounter any trouble.</t4333> <t4334>The clock just struck two, Dr. Van Helsing should be arriving soon.</t4334> <t4335>If he hadn't suggested it, I wouldn't have told him about Jonathan's diary.</t4335> <t4336>As for myself, I can easily make a copy of my own diary for him.</t4336> <t4337>I will let him read it if he wants to know more details about Lucy, that will save me from having to give long and complicated explanations about her.</t4337>
<t4338>• A moment later</t4338>
<t4339>He came and then left again.</t4339> <t4340>It was indeed a touching and interesting conversation! My mind is still spinning and reeling!</t4340> <t4341>I feel like I just went through a trance.</t4341> <t4342>Could it possibly be true, even if only in part!</t4342> <t4343>If I hadn't read Jonathan's diary, I certainly wouldn't have believed a single word of this bizarre story! Poor, poor Jonathan! Now I understand that behind those tormented emotions, he has endured so much.</t4343> <t4344>God wants me not to cause him any more excruciating pain after what I have just learned.</t4344> <t4345>I need to restrain myself to keep secret what Van Helsing just told me.</t4345> <t4346>As a physician, Dr. Van Helsing must be a very kind person, for he is a friend of Arthur and Dr. Seward, and it was they who invited him from Holland to take care of Lucy.</t4346> <t4347>Moreover, only by meeting him did I understand his generous heart.</t4347> <t4348>Tomorrow, when he returns, perhaps I should tell him about Jonathan's condition and what has happened to him.</t4348> <t4349>May God bless us so that we can live peaceful days again.</t4349> <t4350>I always thought that journalism would bring me joy.</t4350> <t4351>A friend of Jonathan's who works for the Exeter News once told me that in journalism, the important thing is to have a good memory, that is, to be able to accurately recall every word spoken by the interviewee before editing the content of the issue.</t4351> <t4352>Surely the content of my conversation with Dr. Van Helsing is not ordinary, but I will try to piece together every detail of the story:</t4352>
<t4353>Two thirty, suddenly heard a knock at the door.</t4353> <t4354>I waited anxiously.</t4354> <t4355>A few minutes passed, the servant Mary ran in to inform me that Van Helsing had arrived.</t4355>
<t4356>I bowed my head to greet the esteemed guest.</t4356> <t4357>He was a medium-built man, quite robust.</t4357> <t4358>His entire demeanor exuded complete reliability with a kind, benevolent face, deep blue eyes that were wide open, serious, bright, and set apart, a high forehead, slightly slanted as if made even more expansive by the reddish-brown hair combed back.</t4358>
<t4359>— Is it Mrs. Harker!</t4359>
<t4360>I nodded in response.</t4360>
<t4361>— The person who used to be called Mina Murray?</t4361>
<t4362>I still just nodded slightly in response.</t4362>
<t4363>— So I am standing before Miss Mina Murray of yesteryear, a friend of the poor child Lucy Westenra...</t4363> <t4364>Yes, Mrs. Mina, I am here to tell you about Lucy's matter.</t4364>
<t4365>— Sir, I truly don't know how to express all my gratitude for your kindness, a friend who has wholeheartedly cared for and helped Lucy Westenra so that she could live peacefully in her final days.</t4365>
<t4366>I timidly extended my hand as a gesture of gratitude for the heart of a person who always knows how to live fully for others.</t4366> <t4367>He firmly grasped my hand and gently responded:</t4367>
<t4368>— Oh! Mrs. Mina, I know that the friend of that pure girl must have a truly kind heart, but I still have to... all things considered, I want to know...</t4368>
<t4369>He suddenly hesitated, bowing his head as a gesture of politeness towards me, and only continued to express himself when I suggested:</t4369>
<t4370>— This is how it is, madam! I have read all the letters you sent to Lucy.</t4370> <t4371>Please don't take offense, but I couldn't help but start by asking someone, though I didn't know whom to ask.</t4371> <t4372>Through the letters, I know you once lived with Lucy and Mrs. Westenra in Whitby.</t4372> <t4373>I also know that she occasionally kept a diary, please don't be surprised, Mrs. Mina.</t4373> <t4374>Lucy kept a diary after you left, it seems she was following your example.</t4374> <t4375>Reading her diary, I had a suspicion that I found hints of a wandering walk during a sleepwalking episode and that you were the one who rescued her.</t4375> <t4376>That's why I had to come here with the hope that you would tell me more details that you remember.</t4376>
<t4377>— Doctor Van Helsing, I think I can recount the entire journey to you accurately.</t4377>
<t4378>— So, the entire journey! All the details!</t4378> <t4379>If that's the case, you truly have an amazing memory, Mrs. Mina! That's rare for women who are always busy with work.</t4379>
<t4380>— Doctor, to be honest, I always have the habit of recording the daily events that I have witnessed.</t4380> <t4381>I can show you that in my diary... if you want.</t4381>
<t4382>— Oh! I really don't know what to do to thank you, Mrs. Mina! You have helped me with something truly useful!</t4382>
<t4383>Why should I suppress the urge to play a little joke on him to relieve the tension? Why always be as dull as a lump of clay?</t4383> <t4384>I think we women are not always like that.</t4384> <t4385>I took my shorthand diary and handed it to Van Helsing.</t4385> <t4386>He politely bowed, took the notebook, and gently asked:</t4386>
<t4387>— Can I read it?</t4387>
<t4388>— Of course! - I calmly replied.</t4388>
<t4389>He opened the notebook and quickly glanced through a few pages.</t4389> <t4390>I immediately recognized the look of confusion on his face.</t4390> <t4391>He stood up abruptly and bowed to me once again.</t4391>
<t4392>— Oh! You truly are a woman who surprises me greatly! I understand that Jonathan has admired you for a long time.</t4392> <t4393>Mrs. Mina, it would be a great honor for me if you could help me read this diary, because to be honest with you, I do not know shorthand!</t4393>
<t4394>I felt that my joke might have gone a bit too far, so I ended up feeling a bit embarrassed.</t4394> <t4395>Therefore, the only thing I could do was to immediately hand over the typed document to him to save face.</t4395>
<t4396>— Excuse me...</t4396> <t4397>I know you are here because of Lucy, and I also understand that you probably don't have much time to stay here long, so I have prepared a copy of the diary for you.</t4397>
<t4398>Van Helsing held my typed manuscript, his face brightened up.</t4398>
<t4399>— You are indeed a very understanding and kind person!</t4399> <t4400>But can I read it right now?</t4400> <t4401>Because only then can I hope you will help me resolve some questions immediately.</t4401>
<t4402>— Certainly! You just sit and read, while I go check how the servants are doing with the meal preparations.</t4402> <t4403>You can ask me anything you like during lunch.</t4403>
<t4404>The Dutch guest thanked me profusely once again and then found a seat, his back facing the window.</t4404> <t4405>I understood that he had been immediately drawn into those diary entries.</t4405> <t4406>I could only return to the office right away to avoid making him feel disturbed.</t4406> <t4407>When I returned to the living room, I saw him pacing back and forth across the room, his face as red as a fighting cock.</t4407> <t4408>Seeing me enter, he hurriedly ran over and grasped my hand tightly:</t4408>
<t4409>— Oh! Mrs. Mina, is that you! How can I express to you my sense of duty now? This diary is like a brilliant ray of sunlight shining within me! It has opened a door before my eyes.</t4409> <t4410>I am dazzled, truly dazzled by that ray of sunlight.</t4410> <t4411>But it is not without the occasional dark clouds drifting behind...</t4411> <t4412>But you don't understand what I mean, you won't be able to understand.</t4412> <t4413>Just know that I owe you, a truly intelligent woman, a great deal.</t4413> <t4414>Madam, - he continued in a very serious tone - I hope that as long as Abraham Van Helsing can do something for you, or your loved ones, you can trust him.</t4414> <t4415>I like... ah, I always want to help you as a friend, yes, as a friend, but let me add, as a sincere friend, unwavering.</t4415> <t4416>Yes, I will do everything I can to help you and those you love dearly.</t4416> <t4417>Life is full of darkness, but that doesn't mean it lacks sources of light.</t4417> <t4418>You are indeed a part of that source of light.</t4418> <t4419>You will be happy, compensated for all the sorrowful days that have passed, and your beloved husband will find in you complete joy.</t4419>
<t4420>— But, doctor, it seems like you are praising me a bit too much...</t4420> <t4421>How do you know what kind of person I am?</t4421>
<t4422>— Do you think I don't know what kind of person you are?</t4422> <t4423>I, an old man who has spent his entire life experiencing, observing the differences between men and women, studying the human brain and everything related to it, am not capable of recognizing what kind of person you are?</t4423> <t4424>I, who have carefully read every line of the diary originating from the very breath of your real life, who have read the letter you wrote to Lucy right after you and your husband got married, cannot recognize who you are!</t4424> <t4425>Alas! Mrs. Mina, generous women do not always use words to tell their own stories.</t4425> <t4426>In this life, every day, every hour, and even every passing minute, angels always pay attention to reading the stories they have written.</t4426> <t4427>And we men always have a burning desire to observe and understand issues, so our eyes are not much different from those of angels.</t4427> <t4428>Your husband must be a very gallant man.</t4428> <t4429>And so are you, because you are someone who always has faith in life, and to have faith in life, one must have compassion...</t4429> <t4430>How is your husband?</t4430> <t4431>Perhaps you should tell me a little about him.</t4431> <t4432>Has he fully recovered? I hope those unreasonable fevers are no longer tormenting him.</t4432>
<t4433>I understand that it is time to tell Van Helsing everything related to Jonathan's health to see what he has to say.</t4433>
<t4434>— My husband has almost recovered, but unfortunately, Mr. Hawkins's death dealt him a blow...</t4434>
<t4435>The Dutch doctor interrupted me:</t4435>
<t4436>— Ah! Yes, I understand...</t4436> <t4437>I understand...</t4437> <t4438>I have read the two latest letters that you...</t4438>
<t4439>— But after all, - I continued, - it was precisely because of the departure of that old friend that my husband was deeply affected.</t4439> <t4440>And last Thursday, when we were in London, it seems my husband suffered another shock.</t4440>
<t4441>— Another shock! Not long after a brain fever?</t4441> <t4442>Oh, dear! That's really terrible!</t4442> <t4443>How did you find your husband behaving?</t4443>
<t4444>— Jonathan thought he had seen someone who brought back a terrible memory, an image that was the cause of his panic disorder.</t4444>
<t4445>As I spoke, my body suddenly trembled as if I could no longer stand, clearly showing that I was also deeply affected.</t4445> <t4446>The love I had for Jonathan, the fears about what he had to endure, the horrifying mystery I speculated upon while reading his diary, and the growing vague anxiety within me after reading his writings—all seemed to conspire to tear my heart apart, making me nearly lose my mind for a moment, as I knelt down, raising my hands towards Van Helsing to beg him to save my husband.</t4446> <t4447>Seeing me in such a state, he hurriedly ran over, made me stand up, and helped me sit down on a chair.</t4447> <t4448>He sat beside me, still holding my hand tightly as a gesture of comfort and reassurance.</t4448>
<t4449>— I have always lived alone, - His pensive voice seemed to carry a noble heart - because my life has always been filled with work, so I can say that in the past, I had no time to sacrifice for friends or family.</t4449> <t4450>But since that day not too long ago, when my dear young friend John Seward invited me here, I suddenly realized that life has many people with noble hearts, with a burning desire to live, to love, and to sacrifice for others.</t4450> <t4451>Yet for so many years, I only knew how to live for myself.</t4451> <t4452>Please believe that I came to your door out of absolute respect from the bottom of my heart for you, because the letters you sent to poor Lucy have brought me immense hope.</t4452> <t4453>Those letters not only helped me discover something I was searching for, but also helped me understand that in this world, there are women who always bring a beautiful meaning to life, women whose existence is a shining example for the children they will bear.</t4453> <t4454>I am truly happy to be here, to do something for you, because if your husband has not yet overcome his panic, I believe I can do something to heal the wound in his heart.</t4454> <t4455>I promise to use all my experience and knowledge to help Jonathan recover quickly, but you must... you must trust me...</t4455>
<t4456>I could only remain silent and listen to him confide.</t4456> <t4457>Every gesture and word of his told me that he was indeed a model person, a devoted and sincere friend whom I could completely trust.</t4457> <t4458>His words of confession helped me regain my composure and sense of security.</t4458>
<t4459>During lunch, he asked me a lot about Lucy and even more about Jonathan.</t4459> <t4460>I could only tell him more about Lucy's sleepwalking, but as for other matters, he must have already known, perhaps even better than I did.</t4460> <t4461>Regarding Jonathan's situation, I found it very difficult to answer.</t4461> <t4462>However, his questions gradually led me to some sort of connection, albeit vague, between seemingly unrelated events.</t4462> <t4463>It was this vague feeling that prompted me to decide to lend him the typewritten copy of Jonathan's diary.</t4463> <t4464>I believe I did the right thing.</t4464> <t4465>Needless to say, Van Helsing was deeply moved when he held the copy of the diary in his hands before leaving for the hotel.</t4465>
<t4466>Van Helsing's letter to Mrs. Harker</t4466>
<t4467>Exeter, 6 PM on September 25</t4467>
<t4468>"Dear Mrs. Harker,</t4468>
<t4469>I was truly moved when I read your husband's diary.</t4469> <t4470>Poor him! He went through so much hardship with horrifying and bizarre experiences.</t4470> <t4471>But madam, please believe that it is the truth, entirely the truth!</t4471> <t4472>However, I also assure you that a man who is brave enough to climb down the steep walls of that eerie castle twice like your husband is not someone we need to worry about.</t4472> <t4473>I very much wish to meet him tomorrow morning.</t4473>
<t4474>Warm regards.</t4474>
<t4475>Abraham Van Helsing.</t4475><t4476>"</t4476>
<t4477>Jonathan Harker's Journal</t4477>
<t4478>• September 26</t4478>
<t4479>To be honest, I never thought I would ever pick up the pen to continue writing in this diary. Yet...</t4479> <t4480>Last night, when I returned home, Mina told me about the visit of the Dutch professor Van Helsing and how she had given him a copy of my diary.</t4480> <t4481>I also read the letter he sent to my wife yesterday afternoon.</t4481> <t4482>That brief letter brought me strength and faith.</t4482> <t4483>Yes!</t4483> <t4484>Everything that happened to me is completely true!</t4484> <t4485>But now I have become a completely different person: I am no longer afraid, even of that bizarre count.</t4485> <t4486>Van Helsing's appearance this morning was truly a breath of fresh air to my weary, weak self.</t4486> <t4487>He is exactly the person I have been waiting for all this time.</t4487> <t4488>I confessed to him everything I had to endure during that nightmarish journey.</t4488>
<t4489>I told him that there was a time when I no longer knew what to believe in and didn't know how to act or whom to rely on anymore.</t4489> <t4490>At times clear-headed, at times confused, I felt like I was following a doomed path from which I couldn't escape.</t4490> <t4491>On the other hand, I still had to endure the fatigue from tasks that were increasingly revealing themselves to be a rut, and because of this, I began to lose faith in myself.</t4491>
<t4492>— Doctor, surely you don't understand what it feels like to doubt everything and doubt yourself! No, you can't understand!</t4492> <t4493>Impossible, absolutely impossible!</t4493> <t4494>I don't see any sign of it on your noble forehead.</t4494>
<t4495>Van Helsing laughed and replied:</t4495>
<t4496>— Wow! You even know about physiognomy!</t4496> <t4497>Since coming here, every hour that passes I learn a little more.</t4497> <t4498>I feel truly honored to share breakfast with you here.</t4498> <t4499>My friend, will you allow this old man to speak most sincerely? You are truly fortunate to have a wife like yours! Professor Van Helsing has been praising Mina throughout our entire conversation, so much so that I could only nod silently and listen.</t4499>
<t4500>— Your wife is truly a person of God. God created her with His own hands to show us that there really is a heaven on this earth, a heaven that one day His flock can ascend to.</t4500> <t4501>That heaven is indeed radiating its brilliant light down onto the bare life of this earth.</t4501> <t4502>A person with loyalty to God and to everyone, with kindness, gentleness, and the willingness to sacrifice everything for those around her like your wife, is not common in this century full of suspicion and selfishness.</t4502> <t4503>And you too, my friend.</t4503> <t4504>I have read all the letters your wife sent to Lucy, including the lines about you.</t4504> <t4505>Therefore, it is not just now that I know about you, but I truly understood you only since last evening.</t4505> <t4506>Come now, my friend, may I shake your hand? We will always be friends.</t4506>
<t4507>We tightly held each other's hands, Van Helsing's sincerity once again genuinely moved me.</t4507>
<t4508>— And now, - he continued - can I ask for your help?</t4508> <t4509>There is a very important matter that I need to resolve, but to do so, the first thing I need is to know.</t4509> <t4510>I came here also because of your help.</t4510> <t4511>Can you tell me what happened before you traveled to Transylvania?</t4511> <t4512>After that, I may still need to rely on you, but to address the issues in a different order.</t4512> <t4513>Just answering that question is enough for me at this moment.</t4513>
<t4514>— But, sir, I don't see any connection between the old count and the story that you are concerned with.</t4514>
<t4515>— Yes, there is, my friend! - He replied with a serious expression.</t4515>
<t4516>— If that's the case, then please trust me.</t4516>
<t4517>After breakfast, I saw him off to the station.</t4517> <t4518>When we parted, he said to me:</t4518>
<t4519>— If I invite you, can you come to London?</t4519> <t4520>Of course, Mrs. Mina too!</t4520>
<t4521>— We will depart immediately if you find it convenient.</t4521>
<t4522>I bought him a few morning newspapers, and also some from the previous afternoon, so he could read them on the train to pass the time.</t4522> <t4523>He stepped onto the train car while quickly skimming through the headlines.</t4523> <t4524>I noticed his eyes seemed to be drawn to a large headline on the Westminster Gazette; his face suddenly turned pale right after that.</t4524> <t4525>I clearly heard his fearful muttering:</t4525>
<t4526>— My God! My God! Here it is! It's out!.</t4526>
<t4527>I am certain that in an inexplicable emotional state, he completely forgot about my presence.</t4527>
<t4528>The steam whistle suddenly let out a long, mournful wail before the train slowly started moving.</t4528> <t4529>Van Helsing jolted back to reality, he leaned out of the door and waved goodbye to me:</t4529>
<t4530>— Give my regards to your wife! I will write to you both as soon as I can.</t4530>
<t4531>Dr. Seward's Diary</t4531>
<t4532>• September 26</t4532>
<t4533>After all, nothing ever really ends.</t4533> <t4534>Since the day I wrote the word "end" in my diary, it hasn't even been a week, yet I have had to pick up the pen again to continue recording my concerns, and the unfortunate thing is that I still cannot avoid the matters that I thought should have ended.</t4534> <t4535>Indeed, until this afternoon, I had no reason to think about anything from the past.</t4535> <t4536>Patient Renfield has become more docile than ever.</t4536> <t4537>For the past few weeks, he has only been taking care of his swarm of flies.</t4537> <t4538>And now, he seems to be mesmerized by the spiders, so I am no longer disturbed by him.</t4538>
<t4539>I just received Arthur's letter written on Sunday.</t4539> <t4540>According to what he said in the letter, I understand he is gradually getting better.</t4540> <t4541>Quincey Morris is with him to help him return to normal life after the recent severe blows.</t4541> <t4542>Morris has always been an energetic and enthusiastic young man.</t4542> <t4543>He also just sent a letter informing me that Arthur has somewhat regained the joy of life.</t4543> <t4544>That puts my mind at ease.</t4544>
<t4545>As for myself, I also tried to get to work with my usual enthusiasm.</t4545> <t4546>I can completely trust that the wound left by the tragic death of poor little Lucy is healing day by day.</t4546> <t4547>Yesterday, Van Helsing went to Exetel and only returned today.</t4547> <t4548>Around five in the afternoon, he came to find me with the Westminster Gazette evening edition in hand.</t4548>
<t4549>— What do you think about this? - He said as he handed me the newspaper and took a few steps back, arms crossed in front of his chest.</t4549>
<t4550>I just skimmed through the newspaper, because to be honest, I still didn't understand what he was implying.</t4550> <t4551>But he stepped forward, gently snatched the newspaper back, and showed me an article about the missing children in the area around Hampstead, all of whom had been found.</t4551> <t4552>I didn't find anything special until I was startled to realize that all the missing children had a small wound, resembling bite marks on their necks.</t4552> <t4553>A thought suddenly flashed in my mind, causing me to look up straight into Van Helsing's eyes.</t4553>
<t4554>— What do you think?</t4554>
<t4555>— That is exactly what happened to Lucy.</t4555>
<t4556>— So how do you explain that?</t4556>
<t4557>— It's very simple, everything has a cause.</t4557> <t4558>Whatever injured Lucy also injured the children.</t4558>
<t4559>— Right... indirectly, but also not without some directness!</t4559>
<t4560>— What do you mean, professor?</t4560>
<t4561>To be honest, I don't understand what the professor intended to say after that answer.</t4561> <t4562>I was about to complain that he often speaks cryptically, or that his nerves still seemed unsettled after the recent stressful days, but when I looked at his face, I immediately changed my mind.</t4562> <t4563>Indeed, never before, even when Lucy's illness drove us to the brink of despair, had Van Helsing appeared so terrified.</t4563>
<t4564>— So, what does the professor think?</t4564> <t4565>Please, professor, explain it to me! Perhaps I can only imagine it but don't know how to reason it out.</t4565>
<t4566>— My friend John, you won't make me believe that you have no suspicions about what could have caused Lucy's death, will you? Of course, I am not just presenting the facts, but also providing the long-standing comments and thoughts to help you understand the issue.</t4566>
<t4567>— Perhaps it is physical exhaustion due to losing too much... too much blood, is that right?</t4567>
<t4568>— So that excessive blood loss you mentioned, do you know what caused it?</t4568>
<t4569>I shook my head in resignation.</t4569> <t4570>Seeing this, he sat down beside me and continued his story:</t4570>
<t4571>— You are very intelligent, John.</t4571> <t4572>You have very sound reasoning and are also very honest, but you have not avoided subjective prejudices.</t4572> <t4573>You don't pay attention to things, and clearly, that has not become a part of your daily life, so you never grasp anything for sure.</t4573> <t4574>Don't you think there are things in this world that, although you don't understand, still exist?</t4574> <t4575>And then some of us can see things that others cannot see!</t4575> <t4576>But to be fair, there are still many things in this world that people cannot understand because they either know or contemplate or perceive - those things are different from what they were taught. That's it!</t4576> <t4577>That is the flaw of science: science always wants to explain everything, and when it can't, it will declare that there is nothing to explain.</t4577> <t4578>However, we can see new theories every day, or rather, theories that claim to be new emerge somewhere, but in fact, they are just old theories dressed up to look new, like the beauties we see in theaters.</t4578> <t4579>Now, may I continue to ask, do you believe in the transformation of bodies?</t4579> <t4580>Will you answer no?</t4580> <t4581>You also don't believe in the theory of materialization?</t4581> <t4582>Also no?</t4582> <t4583>What about talismans?</t4583> <t4584>Yes or no?</t4584> <t4585>And the theory of mind reading? Again no?</t4585> <t4586>So what do you say about hypnosis?</t4586>
<t4587>— Of course, the scientist Charcot has provided us with quite a bit of evidence..</t4587><t4588>.</t4588>
<t4589>He smiled and continued with his arguments:</t4589>
<t4590>— So you have been convinced, haven't you! Obviously, you understand the mechanisms of the theories very well and you have also paid attention to old man Charcot's way of proving things!</t4590> <t4591>Yet he is no longer with us.</t4591> <t4592>Hey, my dear friend John, do I need to understand that you only acknowledge the facts, or the results of the facts, in a simple way without delving deeper into the matter?</t4592> <t4593>No? Then how should I explain it?</t4593> <t4594>Please don't forget that I am also an expert in mental illnesses!</t4594> <t4595>Regarding your acceptance of the theory of somnambulism, yet completely denying telepathy! My friend, let me tell you: in this day and age, people are well aware that electricity is generated from the very materials for which the inventors of the past paid with their lives.</t4595> <t4596>Back then, their inventions were considered fraudulent witchcraft, a blasphemous act, and thus they were burned at the stake.</t4596> <t4597>Life is always full of mysteries.</t4597> <t4598>Why did Methuselah live for nine hundred years, while our poor little Lucy, despite receiving blood transfusions from four people, couldn't live for another day?</t4598> <t4599>Because if she had lived just one more day, perhaps we could have saved her!</t4599> <t4600>Do you thoroughly understand the mystery of life and death?</t4600> <t4601>Do you also have a comprehensive knowledge of comparative anatomy? Now, tell me, why are some men violent while others are not?</t4601> <t4602>Are you sure you can explain the phenomenon that while other spiders die young, the giant spider that lived for centuries in the tower of an old church in Spain kept growing and growing until it was strong enough to crawl down and drink all the oil from the lamps in the temple?</t4602> <t4603>Moreover, how do you explain to me why, in the vast plains of South America, and in other places as well, bats not only roam at night to suck the blood of small animals but also dare to pierce the arteries of large horses to drink to their heart's content?</t4603> <t4604>How do you explain that on some islands in the Atlantic, bats - yes, still bats - always hang from tree branches, waiting for sailors to fall asleep on the decks due to the hot weather, and then swoop down on them, and in the morning, people find them no longer breathing, having died from blood loss just like Lucy?</t4604>
<t4605>— My God! Professor, are you saying that Lucy is the victim of some kind of bat?</t4605> <t4606>And here, in this city of London in the mid-nineteenth century, a similar thing could happen?</t4606>
<t4607>He waved his hand to signal me to be quiet and continued:</t4607>
<t4608>— Can you explain why turtles live longer than many human generations, why elephants witness the rise and fall of human dynasties, and why parrots only die when bitten by a cat or a dog? Can you tell me the reason why humans, at all times and in all places, desire to live forever?</t4608> <t4609>We all know - as science has confirmed - that toads can live for thousands of years in a small cave under the rocks.</t4609> <t4610>Now, explain to me, why can an Indian ascetic sacrifice himself and bury himself, then have someone seal the tomb and sow wheat on it.</t4610> <t4611>Why do people continue to sow seeds on it after the first harvest, and why, when these new crops are harvested, do they come and unseal the tomb to find the ascetic lying inside, not dead, but suddenly standing up to walk with them?</t4611>
<t4612>He suddenly fell silent.</t4612> <t4613>As for me, I felt like my head was about to explode.</t4613> <t4614>Van Helsing was making me endure all sorts of bizarre natural phenomena, things that couldn't be turned into possibilities, which my imagination, though very rich, still couldn't fathom.</t4614> <t4615>I suspected that he was trying to prove something to me, similar to what he had done in Amsterdam in the past, except that back then, he just wanted to find a way to tell me the purpose of his lecture so that I could grasp his lesson in the most impressive way.</t4615> <t4616>But today, I couldn't grasp the starting point of his story, and to be honest, I had no intention of following the scholarly idea and the sequence of events he had outlined.</t4616>
<t4617>— Professor, - I said - please consider me as a beloved student of yours like in the old days.</t4617> <t4618>Please speak directly to the point so that I can relate to the theories you taught me back then; only then can I hope to understand what you intend to say.</t4618> <t4619>At this moment, I am no different from a madman; my mind is completely unwise to connect the examples you just mentioned.</t4619> <t4620>I feel like a child floundering from one bush to another in a foggy swamp, not knowing where I should go.</t4620>
<t4621>— Not bad, you have quite an imagination.</t4621> <t4622>Alright then, I will say immediately what I intend to say: I want you to believe.</t4622>
<t4623>— Believe in what...</t4623><t4624>?</t4624>
<t4625>— You must believe in things that you have never believed in before.</t4625> <t4626>Let me explain.</t4626> <t4627>Once, I heard an American define faith like this: “Faith is a discipline that allows us to believe in things we consider untrue.”</t4627> <t4628>I completely understand his point.</t4628> <t4629>He meant that we need to keep our minds wise and not let a small truth hinder the progress of a greater truth.</t4629> <t4630>The important thing is that first, we must understand that small truth, but we need to properly evaluate its true value and not let ourselves be convinced that it is the truth of the entire vast universe.</t4630>
<t4631>— So, professor, are you saying that preconceived notions cannot become obstacles to acknowledging other more specific ideas?</t4631>
<t4632>— Ah! You have always been one of my best students! I never need to spend much time explaining anything to you! Now, you are ready to delve into the issue as a first step, and I believe you will understand.</t4632> <t4633>So, do you think the small wounds on the children's necks all have the same cause as the wounds we saw on Lucy's neck?</t4633>
<t4634>— Yes, I suppose...</t4634>
<t4635>Van Helsing suddenly stood up.</t4635>
<t4636>— So you were wrong, my friend John.</t4636> <t4637>Oh! If only the truth were like that, how much better it would be!</t4637> <t4638>But, oh Lord! it is not.</t4638> <t4639>The truth is much more terrible, much more indeed.</t4639>
<t4640>— My God! Professor, what are you trying to say that I don't understand?</t4640>
<t4641>He let himself fall heavily into the chair, his elbows slammed onto the table, and he covered his face with his hands, looking utterly despondent.</t4641> <t4642>I was stunned when I heard the professor utter a heavy sentence:</t4642>
<t4643>— What a pity!</t4643> <t4644>Those children are actually the victims of Lucy?</t4644>
<t4645>CHAPTER 15</t4645>
<t4646>Dr. Seward's Diary (continued)</t4646>
<t4647>If Lucy were still alive, I surely wouldn't have lost my temper like that.</t4647>
<t4648>— Professor, are you crazy? - I slammed the table and stood up, shouting, my face flushed with anger.</t4648>
<t4649>Van Helsing sat still, looking up at me, his kind eyes calming me immediately.</t4649>
<t4650>— Oh Lord! - He said very slowly.</t4650> <t4651>- What a pity, I want to go mad but I can't!</t4651> <t4652>If I could go mad, it would be much easier to endure such a truth.</t4652> <t4653>Ah! My friend, why do you think I keep rambling on before confessing that very simple thing!</t4653> <t4654>Is it because I hate you as I have always treated you until now?</t4654> <t4655>Is it because I want you to suffer even more?</t4655> <t4656>Or is it that after all these years, I always intended to repay your life-saving act with those harsh words?</t4656> <t4657>No, absolutely not, isn't that right, my friend?</t4657>
<t4658>— Give me an apology, professor...</t4658>
<t4659>— On the contrary, my friend, when I reveal this truth, I very much want to do so in a way that minimizes your shock, because I always understand that you also love that girl very much.</t4659> <t4660>However, even now, I don't expect you to believe me immediately.</t4660> <t4661>It is really difficult to immediately believe in a vague truth whose starting point is doubt, especially when we always have a tendency to want the opposite.</t4661> <t4662>And it will be much more difficult to admit a specific truth, especially when it is as terrible as the truth I just revealed.</t4662> <t4663>Tonight, I will prove it so you have to believe.</t4663> <t4664>So, do you dare to come with me?</t4664>
<t4665>Seeing that I seemed hesitant, he continued:</t4665>
<t4666>— My reasoning is quite simple.</t4666> <t4667>After all, it is not the reasoning of a madman blindly jumping from one bush to another in a swamp, not knowing where he is headed.</t4667> <t4668>If what I say is not true, then the forthcoming evidence will help us shed a burden, or at least it will not exacerbate Lucy's fateful story.</t4668> <t4669>But what if what I say is true?</t4669> <t4670>There! That is the main issue!</t4670> <t4671>However, I must also say that the very doubt about what is real will support my argument, because what I need first and foremost is faith in reality as it is.</t4671> <t4672>I intend to suggest this to you: first, we will go straight to the Northern Hospital to visit a boy, who is a victim recently reported by the press.</t4672> <t4673>Dr. Vincent, a person from the Northern Hospital, is a friend of mine and possibly a friend of yours, as you both had the opportunity to study together in Amsterdam, if I am not mistaken.</t4673> <t4674>Let's go there, if he cannot help us visit the victim, at least he should facilitate his friend meeting the related doctors.</t4674> <t4675>Do not say anything to him in a hurry, unless we want details about this case.</t4675> <t4676>After that...</t4676>
<t4677>— And then what?</t4677>
<t4678>Van Helsing took a key out of his pocket and tossed it in his palm:</t4678>
<t4679>— After that, you and I will spend the night in the cemetery, where Lucy is resting.</t4679> <t4680>This is the key to the tomb.</t4680> <t4681>The gravedigger asked me to keep it to give back to Arthur.</t4681>
<t4682>Just thinking about some terrible evidence makes me feel like my limbs are about to fall off.</t4682> <t4683>However, I couldn't do anything else but try to show that I also had some courage.</t4683> <t4684>Therefore, I boldly urged him to hurry up, as it was getting dark soon...</t4684>
<t4685>When we entered the hospital room, the young victim boy was awake.</t4685> <t4686>Previously, he had been asleep after drinking a glass of condensed milk, so his overall health condition had somewhat recovered.</t4686> <t4687>Dr. Vincent gently peeled off the bandage on the boy's neck to show us two tiny wounds.</t4687> <t4688>Clearly, these wounds were exactly like the ones on Lucy's neck, except that they seemed fresher and slightly smaller.</t4688> <t4689>We asked Vincent how he explained the cause of the wounds, and he believed the boy had been bitten by an animal, perhaps a rat.</t4689> <t4690>However, he also mentioned that it couldn't be ruled out that the bite was from a bat, as there are many bat colonies residing in the highlands north of London.</t4690> <t4691>He explained:</t4691>
<t4692>— Living among gentle, harmless bats, occasionally there is a wild, aggressive bat coming from the south.</t4692> <t4693>It is also possible that some sailor caught and brought home such a bat and then accidentally let it escape, or it could be a bat that escaped from the zoo. In this case, who can guarantee that it is not a blood-sucking bat?</t4693> <t4694>Because in the zoo, there are many species of bats being kept.</t4694> <t4695>Moreover, less than ten days ago, the zoo let a wolf escape, and someone glimpsed it lurking somewhere around here.</t4695> <t4696>Not only that, for the past week, people have been talking about how children no longer enjoy any game other than "Little Red Riding Hood".</t4696> <t4697>There would be nothing noteworthy if this game did not coincide with the appearance of the blood-stained woman and the overnight disappearance of the children.</t4697> <t4698>So the kids, including this boy, just woke up and asked the nurse if he could leave.</t4698> <t4699>When she asked where he wanted to go, he immediately said he wanted to play with that mysterious woman.</t4699>
<t4700>— Hopefully, when returning this child home, - Van Helsing said - you will remind its parents to keep a closer eye on it.</t4700> <t4701>It is very dangerous for them to leave home, it could even be life-threatening.</t4701> <t4702>But hey, it seems like you intend to keep this kid here for a few more days, don't you?</t4702>
<t4703>— At least another week, or maybe even longer if its wound still hasn't healed.</t4703>
<t4704>Our visit to the hospital lasted longer than expected.</t4704> <t4705>By the time we left, it was already dark.</t4705>
<t4706>— Being in a hurry won't solve anything. - Van Helsing told me.</t4706> <t4707>- I think it's not too late yet.</t4707> <t4708>How about we find something to eat to stave off hunger, then we can do whatever needs to be done.</t4708>
<t4709>We went to have dinner at the "Jack Straw's Castle" pub, where a group of cyclists were noisily eating and drinking with some young people.</t4709> <t4710>Around ten in the evening, we left the inn.</t4710> <t4711>Outside, the street was pitch dark.</t4711> <t4712>Clearly, Van Helsing had already scouted the path we needed to take, as I saw him striding confidently without fear of stumbling over any obstacles.</t4712> <t4713>As for me, to be honest, I would be very embarrassed if someone asked me where I was.</t4713> <t4714>The road became increasingly deserted, although at one point we did encounter a patrol of mounted police.</t4714> <t4715>But finally, we reached the cemetery.</t4715> <t4716>Since the cemetery gate was locked, we had to climb over the wall to get inside.</t4716> <t4717>The task was not easy at all, as it was much darker here than on the street, so we couldn't determine where we were standing.</t4717> <t4718>Yet Van Helsing quickly found the Westenra family mausoleum.</t4718> <t4719>He took out a key to open the mausoleum door, and the heavy door creaked, making my hair stand on end.</t4719> <t4720>The professor politely stepped back to let me go in first.</t4720> <t4721>I felt that in such a situation, his courteous gesture was somewhat humorous.</t4721> <t4722>He carefully closed the door, then took a matchbox and a half-burnt candle from his pocket to light the way.</t4722> <t4723>The mausoleum, which had once left me with a feeling of close familiarity, now suddenly made me shiver with cold.</t4723> <t4724>The pure white flowers meant for Lucy had now withered, fallen to the ground, and given way to a web of cobwebs.</t4724> <t4725>The dust of a thousand years continued its silent work of erasing all traces of this fleeting life.</t4725> <t4726>The nighttime scene in the mausoleum was so eerie! I feared I was about to imagine the most terrifying things possible on a pitch-dark night, in a lonely cemetery, things I had only known from mysterious and mythical stories.</t4726>
<t4727>Van Helsing began his work in a calculated manner.</t4727> <t4728>He raised the candle high, bending down to read the inscriptions on each coffin.</t4728> <t4729>Occasionally, drops of wax fell onto the lid of a coffin, as if to push my tension to its peak.</t4729> <t4730>In front of Lucy's coffin, the professor suddenly bent down and took a screwdriver from his bag.</t4730>
<t4731>— What are you planning to do? - I asked.</t4731>
<t4732>— Open the coffin lid.</t4732> <t4733>Maybe only then will you believe!</t4733>
<t4734>He diligently unscrewed each screw and laboriously lifted the heavy wooden lid to one side, revealing a lead lining inside the coffin.</t4734> <t4735>Perhaps my endurance had reached its limit; his actions made me feel ashamed, as if I were witnessing someone undressing a woman in a deep sleep.</t4735> <t4736>I raised my hand to stop him, but he calmly responded:</t4736>
<t4737>— Don't worry, you will see everything soon!</t4737>
<t4738>He took a small hacksaw out of his bag.</t4738> <t4739>Before I could understand what was happening, he quickly stabbed a screwdriver into the lead casing and twisted it to make a fairly wide hole, just enough to insert the saw blade.</t4739> <t4740>I was shocked and jumped back a few steps, fearing the stench from the coffin was about to waft out.</t4740> <t4741>But the professor remained engrossed in his work, unconcerned with anything other than his ultimate goal.</t4741> <t4742>He sawed the lead casing along a square path, then pulled out a fairly wide piece.</t4742> <t4743>Seeing me still standing there dumbfounded, he waved me over.</t4743>
<t4744>I cautiously took each step towards the coffin.</t4744> <t4745>How strange! Under the dim and flickering light of the candle, I noticed the coffin was completely empty as if nothing had ever been inside.</t4745> <t4746>My body went limp as if my limbs were about to fall off.</t4746> <t4747>It was truly a shock for me, but not for Van Helsing: I saw him still standing there calmly as if he had known everything all along.</t4747> <t4748>More than ever, I suddenly understood that he was right!</t4748>
<t4749>— Do you believe it now, my friend John? Are you completely convinced?</t4749>
<t4750>However, I still haven't given in:</t4750>
<t4751>— I admit that Lucy is not lying in the coffin, but in any case, this fact only proves one thing.</t4751>
<t4752>— What is it, John?</t4752>
<t4753>— What? Lucy's body is not in the coffin, that's all.</t4753>
<t4754>— That's a good argument!</t4754> <t4755>But how do you explain, how do you intend to explain why her body wasn't in there?</t4755>
<t4756>— It could be due to a break-in by a thief, or perhaps her body was stolen by the funeral home staff themselves.</t4756>
<t4757>I also immediately understood that I was saying really naive words, but anyway, that was the only explanation I could think of at the moment.</t4757>
<t4758>Hearing me argue, Van Helsing could only sigh:</t4758>
<t4759>— Alright! So we need to find another piece of evidence.</t4759> <t4760>Follow me outside!</t4760>
<t4761>He quietly closed the coffin lid, picked up the tools, blew out the candles, and then put everything into his bag.</t4761> <t4762>We opened the door and stepped outside.</t4762> <t4763>After locking the door, the professor held up the key and said to me:</t4763>
<t4764>— John, if you feel like it, just take it. Maybe that's the only way you'll stop doubting.</t4764>
<t4765>I forced a smile and brushed it off:</t4765>
<t4766>— What does a single key mean? Who knows, there might be a dozen more like it, and that lock isn't exactly hard to open.</t4766>
<t4767>Van Helsing silently put the key into his pocket and pointed for me to hide behind a pine tree to observe what would happen, while he went alone to check the other end of the cemetery.</t4767> <t4768>Hiding behind the yew tree, I could still see his silhouette before he completely disappeared into the dark bushes.</t4768>
<t4769>To be honest, I lost my confidence when I had to stand alone in the cemetery, in such thick darkness.</t4769> <t4770>The sound of the clock chime suddenly echoed from afar, making me shiver.</t4770> <t4771>So it was already midnight.</t4771> <t4772>I was still anxiously waiting.</t4772> <t4773>One hour, then two hours...</t4773> <t4774>Occasionally, the chime would ring out long and drawn-out, as if coming from the other world.</t4774> <t4775>I felt a chill down my spine; if it continued like this, I might not have the strength and patience to keep watching here.</t4775> <t4776>Perhaps these were the most difficult moments that I could never forget in my life.</t4776>
<t4777>Unconsciously, I turned around and was startled when I suddenly saw a faint white streak gliding through the gap between two pine trees on the other side of the mausoleum. At the same time, a dark shadow suddenly appeared right where the professor was standing.</t4777> <t4778>I intended to rush over but couldn't, because I couldn't jump over the graves without tripping and falling.</t4778>
<t4779>The sky was still pitch black, although occasionally there were roosters crowing somewhere.</t4779> <t4780>Not far from me, behind the juniper trees planted along the path leading to the church, there was a faint white figure quickly moving towards the Westenra family grave.</t4780> <t4781>However, that figure also quickly disappeared from my sight behind the bushes, and I couldn't determine which direction it ran.</t4781> <t4782>Only the sound of hurried footsteps remained right where that white figure had just passed.</t4782> <t4783>A few minutes later, I saw Van Helsing suddenly reappear, holding a child in his arms.</t4783>
<t4784>As soon as he reached my place, he immediately asked:</t4784>
<t4785>— So, do you still refuse to believe it now?</t4785>
<t4786>— Not yet!</t4786>
<t4787>— So, didn't you see this kid?</t4787>
<t4788>— Yes, I saw it earlier...</t4788> <t4789>But who brought it here?</t4789> <t4790>Is it injured?</t4790>
<t4791>— We'll know soon enough.</t4791>
<t4792>He just said that and then carried the boy straight towards the cemetery gate.</t4792> <t4793>Weary, I followed behind.</t4793>
<t4794>We stopped by a dense clump of trees.</t4794> <t4795>Van Helsing struck a match to examine the boy's neck.</t4795> <t4796>There wasn't a single scratch, not even a tiny one.</t4796>
<t4797>— I was right, wasn't I? - I asked, with a triumphant tone.</t4797>
<t4798>— Luckily, we made it in time! - The professor replied with a sigh of relief.</t4798>
<t4799>What to do with this kid now? If we take him to a police station, we will definitely have to explain to them why we found him, and that would not be good at all.</t4799> <t4800>So we decided to take him out to the clearing, and when we hear the police, we will leave him in a spot where the police can't help but see him.</t4800> <t4801>Right after that, we will find a way to slip away as quickly as possible.</t4801> <t4802>And everything went smoothly just as we expected.</t4802>
<t4803>When we first arrived at the clearing, we heard the heavy footsteps of a police officer.</t4803> <t4804>After leaving the boy by a small path, we quickly hid in a bush and waited until the police officer, holding a lantern, walked by and exclaimed in surprise upon suddenly noticing the young victim sitting alone.</t4804> <t4805>That was our cue; the two of us quickly nudged each other and slipped away.</t4805> <t4806>Fortunately, just as we reached the main road, we encountered a horse-drawn carriage heading towards the city.</t4806>
<t4807>Thinking that I wouldn't be able to sleep, I lay with my hands on my forehead, pondering, intending to connect the scattered events to find some thread running through the issue, but then I fell asleep without knowing it, because when Van Helsing came to call me, it was already noon.</t4807> <t4808>He intended to invite me to explore once more.</t4808>
<t4809>• September 27</t4809>
<t4810>Two hours had passed since we decided to take the risk with this second plan.</t4810> <t4811>The burial of some unfortunate person, which had started at noon, had just ended; friends and family of the deceased were gradually leaving.</t4811> <t4812>Sitting hidden behind a bush, we clearly saw the gravedigger—the last person in the cemetery—preparing to wrap up his final tasks.</t4812> <t4813>In just a moment, he would lock the gate, and we would be free to do whatever we wanted until the next morning.</t4813> <t4814>But the professor told us that we only needed a maximum of one hour. Just like the previous day, I began to experience an indescribable, vague sense of dread, even though it was daytime now, and despite my efforts to imagine the best possible scenarios.</t4814> <t4815>I fully understood that to complete this perplexing task, we might have to face legal punishment.</t4815> <t4816>Moreover, to be honest, I still believed that what we were about to do was utterly pointless!</t4816> <t4817>If opening the coffin to see if the body that had been placed there for over a week was truly dead was a disgusting act, then the effort to return to the tomb once more to prove that the coffin was empty as I had seen with my own eyes—now that was an entirely insane action! But I had no intention of commenting on what I was thinking, because I always understood that once Van Helsing had something in his mind, it was hard for anyone to change it.</t4817> <t4818>Therefore, I remained silent as I watched him take out the key to open the tomb door.</t4818> <t4819>Just like before, he stepped aside as a polite gesture to let me go in first.</t4819> <t4820>The scene inside the tomb seemed less eerie than it did late at night, but the sunlight filtering through the door cracks was still so weak and fragile! Van Helsing approached Lucy's coffin, and I trudged along behind him.</t4820> <t4821>He bent down to lift the coffin lid and the piece of lead that had been cut before, placing them aside.</t4821> <t4822>I could hardly believe my eyes: yes, once again I was astonished, astonished to the point of terror!</t4822>
<t4823>Lucy is lying in there, in the exact position we witnessed when she was placed in the coffin a few days ago.</t4823> <t4824>One very strange thing is that her body now looks more beautiful than ever, making it hard for me to believe that she is dead.</t4824> <t4825>Her lips are still as red as lipstick, even redder than when she was alive, and her cheeks are also glowing with a rosy hue as if just applied with premium blush.</t4825>
<t4826>— Could it be a magic trick?</t4826> <t4827>- I asked, still in shock.</t4827>
<t4828>— Are you convinced now? - Van Helsing asked as he reached down towards the corpse.</t4828> <t4829>His action made me want to vomit: he was pulling back the lips of the person lying there, exposing the stark white teeth.</t4829>
<t4830>— Look, look very carefully: were her teeth this sharp before? These are the very teeth that bit into the necks of those boys.</t4830> <t4831>Now you can't have any doubts, can you, John?</t4831>
<t4832>I still want to argue, to deny what is obvious to him, but absolutely unacceptable to me.</t4832>
<t4833>— What if last night, someone brought Lucy's body back here?</t4833>
<t4834>— Really? Try telling me who that person is?</t4834>
<t4835>— How would I know.</t4835> <t4836>But surely someone must have brought the corpse back to its original place!</t4836>
<t4837>— Well, let's just say that's the case, but Lucy has been dead for over a week now.</t4837> <t4838>Is it possible that after all those days, the corpse's appearance hasn't changed?</t4838>
<t4839>At this point, I was at a loss for words.</t4839> <t4840>However, Van Helsing didn't seem to care about my predicament, which was part of his character; in any case, I very rarely saw him show signs of irritation or satisfaction openly.</t4840> <t4841>He was intently observing Lucy's face, and once again I felt nauseated as I saw him part her lips to examine the teeth of the unfortunate girl.</t4841>
<t4842>The part where he turned to tell me:</t4842>
<t4843>— It seems there is something very different from everything I have known until now.</t4843> <t4844>We are facing a phenomenon of life bifurcation that is very rarely encountered; this girl was bitten by a "vampire" while she was in a state of hypnosis, sleepwalking...</t4844> <t4845>Oh dear! Did I startle you?</t4845> <t4846>John, indeed you don't know, but I will explain so you can understand.</t4846> <t4847>When the girl fell into a hallucinatory state, surely that vampire came and drained all the blood from her body.</t4847> <t4848>She died in a state of trance.</t4848> <t4849>On the other hand, she also became an undead in the same state due to the power of that vampire.</t4849> <t4850>That is the reason why she is not at all like other cases.</t4850> <t4851>Usually, when the immortals sleep at their homes, - the professor said, gesturing as if to remind me that some "vampires" are at their homes in the cemeteries - their faces always reveal the characteristic hideous features that they cannot lack.</t4851> <t4852>But in this case, Lucy's face remains strangely gentle and does not bear any mark of the devil at all.</t4852> <t4853>That is why killing Lucy while she is sleeping like this is extremely difficult for me.</t4853>
<t4854>The blood in my veins seemed to be freezing.</t4854> <t4855>It seemed that Van Helsing's reasoning was gradually convincing me.</t4855> <t4856>But if Lucy was truly dead, what was there to fear in deciding to help her rest in peace once more?</t4856>
<t4857>The professor looked at me, and for some reason, his voice seemed happier than before; perhaps his emotions were changing:</t4857>
<t4858>— Ah! Now you believe me, don't you?</t4858>
<t4859>— It's not that fast.</t4859> <t4860>To be honest, the more I want to acknowledge your opinion, the more I feel I need to think about it.</t4860> <t4861>So how do you plan to resolve this?</t4861>
<t4862>— A stake must be driven into the body of the immortal, on the left side of the chest, then fill her mouth with garlic.</t4862>
<t4863>I almost yelled at the professor.</t4863> <t4864>I really couldn't stand the sight of people tearing apart the body of a girl I loved so dearly!</t4864> <t4865>However, I still tried to suppress my emotions.</t4865> <t4866>My body began to tremble as I suddenly remembered the existence of a strange entity, someone the professor called the immortal.</t4866> <t4867>The girl I loved had become a horrifying creature.</t4867> <t4868>Is it true that love always carries such extreme opposites?</t4868>
<t4869>The moment of waiting for Van Helsing to take action seemed to stretch on endlessly.</t4869> <t4870>He still stood there, motionless, immersed in his own thoughts.</t4870> <t4871>Finally, I saw him kick the bag aside and say in a very decisive voice:</t4871>
<t4872>— John, I've thought it through carefully, we need to act in the most considerate way.</t4872><t4873>If I follow my own bias, I would definitely have to take action immediately!</t4873><t4874>Yes, right now.</t4874><t4875>But we can't ignore the unforeseen consequences that we can't even imagine.</t4875><t4876>Clearly, Lucy hasn't killed anyone yet, but it's only a matter of time.</t4876><t4877>If I act now, I will permanently remove her from being a threat to so many people.</t4877><t4878>But on the other hand, we also can't ignore Arthur's opinion.</t4878><t4879>Honestly, I still don't know how to explain the whole story to him right now.</t4879><t4880>If he has seen the wound on Lucy's neck and the wounds on the necks of the young victims in the hospital; if he has witnessed the coffin, which just yesterday was empty, but today contains a girl who, more than a week after her death, has become fresher and more beautiful than ever; if you, who directly saw a faint white figure dragging a child into the cemetery in the dead of night yesterday, still find it hard to believe your own eyes, then how can we expect Arthur - who hasn't seen anything firsthand - to believe the story I'm telling? He will doubt and ask why I prevented him from kissing Lucy when she was about to die.</t4880><t4881>If he forgives me, it will only be because he believes I prevented him from saying goodbye to her due to a mistaken diagnosis.</t4881><t4882>And now, he might believe that because of that mistake, she was buried alive.</t4882><t4883>In short, he will think that we killed her due to compounded mistakes.</t4883><t4884>And he will think that we are just ignorant frauds, the culprits who killed her to prove our actions were right.</t4884><t4885>As a result, he will feel increasingly unhappy, and the unfortunate thing is that he will never be certain of anything.</t4885><t4886>That is the worst part.</t4886><t4887>Sometimes he will think his beloved was buried alive, and then some nightmares will become so terrible that he can't help but imagine the worst things she might have endured; other times he will tell himself that maybe we did the right thing, and in the end, she was indeed an immortal as I said.</t4887><t4888>Well! I did hint to him once about the worst that could happen, but perhaps he never imagined such a contradictory and tragic situation as this.</t4888><t4889>And now I can only be sure of one thing: Arthur will have to go through difficult and bitter moments before he can have a completely peaceful life later on.</t4889><t4890>Oh Lord! That poor guy will continue to experience sorrowful moments where, for him, the sky will seem to be falling.</t4890><t4891>However, after that, we will have to find a way to bring him back to peace and tranquility in his heart.</t4891><t4892>It has to be that way...</t4892><t4893>Now, perhaps we should go back.</t4893><t4894>You will return to your patients.</t4894><t4895>As for me, I will spend the night here, in this cemetery.</t4895><t4896>At six o'clock tomorrow evening, come find me at the Berkeley Hotel. I will write a few lines to Arthur to invite him and the American Quincy Morris to come here as well.</t4896><t4897>We all have a lot of work to do.</t4897><t4898>Now, I will go with you to Piccadilly to eat something first, then I will try to return here before sunset.</t4898>
<t4899>Van Helsing quietly locked the mausoleum door and walked with me towards the cemetery fence.</t4899> <t4900>I climbed out first, he followed.</t4900> <t4901>The two of us trudged back to the road leading to the Piccadilly inn.</t4901>
<t4902>Letter to Dr. John Seward from Van Helsing stored in the suitcase at the Berkeley Hotel</t4902>
<t4903>"September 27"</t4903>
<t4904>Dear John,</t4904>
<t4905>I have to write a few lines to you, in case something unfortunate happens and I don't get the chance to see you again.</t4905><t4906>I have to return to the cemetery to monitor the situation that I have predicted.</t4906><t4907>I want to prevent the immortal being, that is Lucy, from leaving the mausoleum tonight, so that tomorrow night she will be even more eager to escape from there.</t4907><t4908>I will attach to the mausoleum door things that the immortal being dislikes, such as garlic and a crucifix, which should be enough to keep her in.</t4908><t4909>However, garlic and the crucifix only have the effect of preventing Lucy from escaping, not guaranteeing that she will give up the desire to get out.</t4909><t4910>I will stay in the mausoleum all night, from sunset until dawn, so that if anything happens, I can report it to you.</t4910><t4911>Regarding anything related to Lucy, either concerning herself or originating from her, I have no worries.</t4911>
<t4912>The worrying thing originates from a certain force that was the cause of turning Lucy into that immortal being.</t4912> <t4913>That force now has the power to find her grave and take refuge in it.</t4913> <t4914>He is extremely cunning.</t4914> <t4915>I say this not just based on Jonathan's account, but also on the many tricks that cunning being has used against us when he interfered in Lucy's life and made us the losers.</t4915> <t4916>In reality, the immortal is always very strong.</t4916> <t4917>One of his hands might be stronger than ten people.</t4917> <t4918>The fact that the four of us took turns donating blood to Lucy ultimately was a futile effort.</t4918> <t4919>Moreover, that dark force also has the power to summon wolves and possibly other wild beasts that I am not yet aware of.</t4919> <t4920>In short, if he comes to the cemetery tonight, he will encounter me.</t4920> <t4921>But it is also possible that he will not come.</t4921> <t4922>His hunting grounds surely have many more foolish prey than this desolate graveyard, where only an immortal young girl, Lucy, is sleeping and an old man, me, is awake.</t4922>
<t4923>Anyway, I still write these few short lines to you in case anything happens.</t4923> <t4924>Please take Harker's diary, the other documents that I have prepared along with this letter, and read and ponder them carefully.</t4924> <t4925>After that, you must be braver to act on my behalf.</t4925> <t4926>Do as I have said: though it is very painful, you must find that immortal being to either incinerate the hellish heart or stake her body.</t4926> <t4927>Only then can those around us be free from a potential disaster caused by her in the future.</t4927>
<t4928>Goodbye, or maybe farewell forever!</t4928>
<t4929>Van Helsing.</t4929><t4930>"</t4930>
<t4931>Dr. Seward's Diary</t4931>
<t4932>• September 28</t4932>
<t4933>To be able to sleep for one night at this moment is a very good thing for me.</t4933> <t4934>Yesterday, I almost accepted all of Van Helsing's bizarre ideas.</t4934> <t4935>I no longer doubt that he always believes in what he says, but occasionally I still wonder if his mind is ever disturbed.</t4935> <t4936>However, it must be admitted that he has a very fitting explanation for all the things I find mysterious.</t4936> <t4937>Moreover, he is an intelligent and stubbornly determined person.</t4937> <t4938>Whenever he gets excited, he will find every way to carry out his intention—whatever that intention may be, and of course, nothing can stop him.</t4938> <t4939>To be honest, his personality sometimes troubles me, and what I fear most right now is someone calling him crazy! But regardless of what is said, I will now have to keep an eye on him, because in this world, nothing is impossible!</t4939> <t4940>Of course, I also have to determine if there is any light leading to that mysterious story.</t4940>
<t4941>• September 29</t4941>
<t4942>Around nearly ten o'clock last night, Arthur and Quincey invited each other to Van Helsing's room.</t4942> <t4943>The professor had told us what he expected from each person, but the one he was most concerned about was, of course, Arthur, as if the goodwill of all of us depended solely on him.</t4943>
<t4944>He began the story by expressing hope that all three of us would listen to him.</t4944>
<t4945>— Because we - he said specifically - must together complete a task that is both sacred and very arduous.</t4945> <t4946>You must have been very surprised when you read my letter? - He asked Arthur.</t4946>
<t4947>— Yes, it is indeed so.</t4947> <t4948>- Arthur replied.</t4948> <t4949>- I have had too many troubles, too many things to worry about recently.</t4949> <t4950>May I have enough strength to easily overcome all of it! Quincey and I have talked a lot about your letter.</t4950> <t4951>We do not exactly understand what the letter is trying to say.</t4951> <t4952>The more we discuss it, the less we understand.</t4952> <t4953>I can only say that despite racking my brain, in the end, I still do not understand.</t4953>
<t4954>— I have no idea either, Professor. - Quincey interrupted.</t4954>
<t4955>— Oh! Then you all will understand the issue faster than our friend John here.</t4955> <t4956>He had to trudge along a long way, only now starting to vaguely see what was right in front of him.</t4956>
<t4957>Clearly, even though I hadn't said a word, he could still guess that I was not yet free of doubt.</t4957> <t4958>He turned to explain to the two other guests with an extremely serious demeanor:</t4958>
<t4959>— I intend to ask you for permission to do something tonight that I have considered necessary to do.</t4959> <t4960>Perhaps I am asking a bit too much of you.</t4960> <t4961>Only when you know my intentions can you weigh the demands I am making.</t4961> <t4962>So, can I suggest that you allow me to proceed without concerning yourselves with what I have to do, so that afterwards, if you wish — which I think is very likely — you won't have any reason to blame yourselves?</t4962>
<t4963>— Then please, Professor, just say it straight out. - Quincey eagerly suggested.</t4963> <t4964>- I trust the Professor.</t4964> <t4965>Even though I don't know where you are headed, I have always understood that in any circumstance, your intentions are always good.</t4965> <t4966>And for me, that's enough.</t4966>
<t4967>— Thank you, young friend. It is truly an honor to have a trustworthy friend like you, and I will never forget that - Van Helsing responded and extended his hand to Quincey.</t4967>
<t4968>— Doctor Van Helsing, - Arthur spoke up - I really don't want to buy a cat in a bag as people often say, but what I am concerned about is that if the honor of a nobleman and my faith in the good Lord are harmed, then I certainly cannot make the promise you suggested.</t4968> <t4969>On the other hand, if you assure me that what you intend to do will not harm anyone, then I can let you act freely right now, even though I am not clear on what you are planning.</t4969>
<t4970>— I accept your conditions, - Van Helsing replied - and all I ask now is that before you object to any of my actions, you should carefully consider and understand whether I have met those conditions or not.</t4970>
<t4971>— Agreed - Arthur promised. - Now can I ask you about what we will have to do?</t4971>
<t4972>— I want you to come with me to Kingstead Cemetery with the utmost sense of secrecy.</t4972>
<t4973>Arthur asked in astonishment, his face elongating:</t4973>
<t4974>— To the cemetery where Lucy is resting?</t4974>
<t4975>The professor nodded in response.</t4975>
<t4976>— And then what happened?</t4976>
<t4977>— What now? We will go together into her family tomb.</t4977>
<t4978>Arthur stood up abruptly.</t4978>
<t4979>— Dr. Van Helsing, you aren't joking, are you?...</t4979> <t4980>Sorry, looking at you, it doesn't seem like there's any lack of seriousness here.</t4980>
<t4981>Arthur slowly sat down again, clearly trying to be discreet.</t4981> <t4982>After pondering for a moment, he finally asked softly, with a hint of concession:</t4982>
<t4983>— So when do we go in there?</t4983>
<t4984>— We will open Lucy's coffin.</t4984> <t4985>- Van Helsing continued without directly answering Arthur's question.</t4985>
<t4986>— You are outrageous! - Arthur stood up abruptly, his face showing clear anger.</t4986> <t4987>- Everything has its limits! I can only be patient to a certain extent, but this... this way of desecrating the resting place of someone who has...</t4987>
<t4988>Arthur's rage rendered him speechless.</t4988>
<t4989>Van Helsing sadly looked at him, with a look of pity:</t4989>
<t4990>— My poor friend, if I could avoid causing you such a strong emotion, surely God knows I would do it!</t4990> <t4991>But tonight, we still have to walk a thorny path, otherwise, forever and ever, the girl you love will be engulfed in the fiery roads of hell!</t4991>
<t4992>Arthur looked up at the old doctor, his eyes growing pale.</t4992>
<t4993>— Doctor, please be careful with your words!</t4993>
<t4994>— Perhaps first, you should take the trouble to listen to what I have to say - Van Helsing calmly replied. - After all, you really need to know my intention.</t4994> <t4995>Do you want me to state that intention right now?</t4995>
<t4996>— Maybe it's better that way! - Quincey wanted to say, as if to lighten the heavy atmosphere of the conversation.</t4996>
<t4997>Van Helsing sat quietly for a long time, as if he were preparing himself mentally to say something he found very difficult to express.</t4997> <t4998>Finally, he had to get straight to the point:</t4998>
<t4999>— Miss Lucy is dead, isn't she? Of course, we all know that.</t4999> <t5000>If that is indeed the case, then nothing can harm her.</t5000> <t5001>But if she isn't dead, then...</t5001><t5002>.</t5002>
<t5003>Arthur suddenly jumped up and shouted:</t5003>
<t5004>— My God! What are you babbling about? Could it be a hoax?</t5004> <t5005>Could it be that she was buried alive?</t5005>
<t5006>— I am not saying that at that time, she was still alive, my friend, and I did not think so either.</t5006> <t5007>I am just saying that maybe she had become an immortal, that's all.</t5007>
<t5008>— Not dead?</t5008> <t5009>And then not alive anymore, is that what you mean? What do you mean by that?</t5009> <t5010>Could it be that I still haven't gotten through the nightmare of my life?</t5010>
<t5011>— In this world, there are always mysteries that human intellect can only speculate about without knowing how to explain; there are also mysteries that, with each passing century, people can only gradually clarify parts of their content.</t5011> <t5012>Please believe me, my friend, we are indeed facing such a mystery, and I hope we will find its key.</t5012> <t5013>Let me continue my work with your permission.</t5013> <t5014>Will you allow me to stake Lucy?</t5014>
<t5015>— Oh, heavens and earth - Arthur suddenly wailed in agony, as if his anger and suffering had reached their peak - Oh, God! There's no way I'll let anyone disgrace her.</t5015><t5016>Dr. Van Helsing, you've gone too far!</t5016><t5017>What have I done to deserve such torment from you!</t5017><t5018>What crime has Lucy committed that you bring friends to desecrate her resting place like this?</t5018><t5019>Are you mad to utter such insane words, or am I mad to listen to them?</t5019><t5020>From now on, don't even dream of desecrating her resting place.</t5020><t5021>No way! I must protect her, and God will witness that I will do everything to fulfill my duty!</t5021>
<t5022>Van Helsing got up from the couch, where he had been sitting all this time, and replied sternly:</t5022>
<t5023>— I too, Lord Godalming, have an obligation that I must fulfill, and there is no other way.</t5023> <t5024>It is an obligation to everyone, to you, and to the girl who has passed away.</t5024> <t5025>All I need from you now is to trust me, to follow me to the cemetery to witness firsthand, to see, to hear what will happen.</t5025> <t5026>After that, if I still make the same proposal and you find it inconvenient to respond, then I ask to... to fulfill my duty if necessary.</t5026> <t5027>I will explain everything to you later.</t5027>
<t5028>His voice gradually faded, then fell silent, and then suddenly softly resounded again, but this time it seemed a bit forlorn:</t5028>
<t5029>— But I beg you, please don't be angry with me anymore! Throughout my life, I have rarely had the chance to do pleasant things.</t5029> <t5030>There were even times when I had to face heart-wrenching matters that I couldn't ignore.</t5030> <t5031>Do you think I don't have thoughts?</t5031> <t5032>I am also very sad, very heartbroken! But that's life!</t5032> <t5033>How many people always get what they want?</t5033> <t5034>However, I must admit that I have never had to fulfill a duty as difficult as the one awaiting me.</t5034> <t5035>Believe in me, my friend, believe that if one day, everyone's feelings towards me suddenly change, and only the feelings of a friend like you remain...</t5035> <t5036>For me, that would be more than enough to dispel the sorrows of this sad moment, because I have done what a person can do to ease some of your heart's wounds.</t5036> <t5037>Just think about it! Why do I have to struggle like this! Why do I have to take on such troublesome matters? I came from the Netherlands to wholeheartedly care for a patient.</t5037> <t5038>At first, I came only to respond to the invitation of our friend John here.</t5038> <t5039>After that, I tirelessly treated a girl—who gradually inspired in me the feelings of a true friendship.</t5039> <t5040>I know it's not good to bring this up, but I still have to say that I also donated blood to her, just like you did with the blood from your heart.</t5040> <t5041>Yes, I gave the girl a part of my blood.</t5041> <t5042>But the only difference is that to her, you are a fiancé, while I am just a doctor and at most, a friend.</t5042> <t5043>I devoted many days, even many nights, to her, and I did so not only before she died, but also throughout the time she was no longer alive.</t5043> <t5044>If my death could somehow ease the cruel fate of the girl, who has now become immortal, I would be ready immediately.</t5044>
<t5045>It is not difficult to recognize that Van Helsing's voice contained something truly bitter, yet it was not lacking in sympathy.</t5045> <t5046>I understand that Arthur was also very emotional and in a state of turmoil, because after a moment of silently listening to the professor's confession, he trembled as he stood up to shake his hand as a gesture of regret, and responded in a breathless voice:</t5046>
<t5047>— Oh my God! Everything is so chaotic, tragic, and confusing! But alright, I will follow the professor to the cemetery.</t5047> <t5048>Then we will see...</t5048>
<t5049>CHAPTER 16</t5049>
<t5050>Dr. Seward's Diary (continued)</t5050>
<t5051>Near midnight, we climbed over the wall into the cemetery.</t5051> <t5052>The sky was pitch black, except for the rare moments when a crescent moon would unexpectedly appear, peeking out from behind the drifting giant clouds.</t5052> <t5053>Van Helsing led the way, and we closely followed behind.</t5053> <t5054>As we approached the grave, I had to keep an eye on Arthur, fearing that sad memories might overwhelm him.</t5054> <t5055>But fortunately, he managed to keep his composure.</t5055> <t5056>Perhaps the puzzling story that Van Helsing had just told somewhat distracted him from his worries.</t5056> <t5057>Seeing our hesitation, the professor went in first.</t5057> <t5058>After we all entered, he closed the door, lit a lamp, and pointed to where Lucy's coffin was placed.</t5058> <t5059>Arthur hesitated to go ahead, while Van Helsing engaged me in conversation.</t5059>
<t5060>— Yesterday, you came here with me.</t5060> <t5061>Lucy is no longer in the coffin, right?</t5061>
<t5062>— That's right!</t5062>
<t5063>The part where he turned to tell the other two guys:</t5063>
<t5064>— Did you hear that? Yet, there are still people who don't believe me!</t5064>
<t5065>Van Helsing approached the coffin again, bent down to unscrew it, and lifted the wooden lid aside.</t5065> <t5066>Arthur stood silently, wide-eyed, his face pale.</t5066> <t5067>When the wooden lid was placed aside, he anxiously moved closer.</t5067> <t5068>Clearly, he did not know that there was a lead lining inside the coffin.</t5068> <t5069>Seeing the cut on the lead lining, his face suddenly flushed red, then turned pale again.</t5069> <t5070>Van Helsing lifted the cut piece of lead, and we stared in astonishment: The coffin was empty again!</t5070>
<t5071>We were stunned into silence, no one said a word to anyone.</t5071> <t5072>Finally, Quincey Morris was the first to speak:</t5072>
<t5073>— Professor, as I said, I have great faith in you.</t5073> <t5074>Your sincere words are enough to make me believe.</t5074> <t5075>Normally, I wouldn't ask you any questions, fearing you might think I still doubt you, but here we are faced with such an extraordinary mystery that I can't help but ask: Who did this, sir?</t5075>
<t5076>— Before everything that is most sacred, I swear to you all that I did not take the girl out of here and am absolutely not involved in this matter.</t5076> <t5077>This is what happened: the night before last, John and I came here with the best intentions, please believe me.</t5077> <t5078>I opened the coffin, which was still sealed with wax, and found that there was nothing in the coffin, just like now.</t5078> <t5079>Therefore, we decided to stand watch outside and indeed we discovered a figure dressed entirely in white flickering among the trees.</t5079> <t5080>Yesterday, we came back here again, but during the day, and saw that Lucy had been lying in there since who knows when.</t5080> <t5081>Isn't that right, John?</t5081>
<t5082>— Yes.</t5082>
<t5083>— The first night, we arrived just in time.</t5083> <t5084>Another boy had gone missing, but thank God, we found him among the graves and fortunately, he was unharmed.</t5084> <t5085>Yesterday, after coming here once during the day, I returned just before sunset, because during sunset, the immortals can leave their graves.</t5085> <t5086>I sat here waiting from then until morning, but saw nothing unusual.</t5086> <t5087>Simply because I had hung garlic and a crucifix, which are things that the immortals are very afraid of, on the door of the mausoleum.</t5087> <t5088>The other night, the immortal had left.</t5088> <t5089>Today as well, before sunset, I removed the garlic and crucifix from the door.</t5089> <t5090>That's why the coffin is empty like this.</t5090> <t5091>But follow me, there are even stranger things about to happen.</t5091> <t5092>Let's hide in a spot not far from here, and you will see whether I am telling the truth or lying.</t5092> <t5093>Come on, let's get out of here.</t5093>
<t5094>He closed the lantern lid, waited for us all to leave, and then locked the door.</t5094>
<t5095>Wow! Coming out here, I can feel the air is much cooler and more breathable than in that eerie mausoleum. It's so pleasant to be back under the indifferent clouds drifting across the night sky.</t5095><t5096>I suddenly feel that the pale moonlight peeking through those strangely shaped clouds is a rare, soothing moment, cutting through the heavy worries weighing on my heart.</t5096><t5097>It's also a relief to breathe the air outside, which is less tainted with the stench of decay and death.</t5097><t5098>I feel somewhat reassured when I notice the first slender rays of light about to break over a distant hill and the faint sounds echoing from a large city.</t5098><t5099>But even so, our faces still couldn't hide the tension as we left the mausoleum.</t5099><t5100>Arthur remained silent; I guessed he was racking his brain trying to understand why such absurd things were happening.</t5100><t5101>As for me, I increasingly felt convinced by the conclusions Van Helsing had drawn.</t5101><t5102>Meanwhile, Quincey showed no reaction, or rather, he had the look of someone who had accepted everything others said, but with a lingering doubt in his heart.</t5102><t5103>Knowing he couldn't light a cigarette, he took a piece of tobacco and chewed it.</t5103><t5104>As for Van Helsing, he was still engrossed in his work.</t5104><t5105>He took out something that looked like a biscuit or a thin communion wafer, carefully wrapped in a piece of white cloth, followed by two handfuls of some white powder, probably flour.</t5105><t5106>He crumbled the biscuit and mixed it with the powder into a lump.</t5106><t5107>Then, he rolled the dough into long, thin strands to seal the cracks in the mausoleum doors.</t5107><t5108>What he was doing didn't surprise me, but I still asked him what his purpose was. Both Arthur and Quincey also curiously came closer to hear his explanation:</t5108>
<t5109>— I did it so that the immortal could not return there.</t5109>
<t5110>— Could that silly powder really have such an effect? - Quincey asked, incredulously. - It feels like you are joking!</t5110>
<t5111>— Joking?</t5111>
<t5112>— But what exactly did you use? - Arthur asked curiously.</t5112>
<t5113>— Holy wafer.</t5113> <t5114>I took the trouble to bring it from Amsterdam.</t5114> <t5115>The Pope gave it to me.</t5115>
<t5116>Van Helsing's answer cleverly addressed our skepticism, and naturally, everyone had to feel that with such a serious intention from the professor, an intention that required him to use the most sacred object, we could no longer have any doubts.</t5116><t5117>After sealing the door gaps with that sacred charm, he pointed out hiding spots around the mausoleum for each of us.</t5117><t5118>The spots he chose were indeed clever.</t5118><t5119>From our hiding places, we could cover a fairly wide area, but conversely, no outsider could detect us.</t5119><t5120>Suddenly, I felt concerned for my two companions, especially Arthur.</t5120><t5121>After all, I was more accustomed to the eerie and ghastly surroundings of the cemetery than they were, thanks to my previous visits.</t5121><t5122>However, if less than an hour ago I had denied the evidence Van Helsing presented, now I felt my heart was about to leap out of my chest.</t5122><t5123>I vaguely felt that the truth was increasingly becoming undeniable.</t5123><t5124>Never before had I seen the graves at night appear so eerily white and ghostly.</t5124><t5125>Never before had the cypress trees, yew trees, and red-berried pines seemed so mournful.</t5125><t5126>Every bush and blade of grass before my eyes had never swayed in the wind with such a ghostly appearance.</t5126><t5127>Everywhere I looked, I saw mystery, coldness, and desolation; even the distant howling and yelping of the house dogs made me think of some ominous sign about to descend upon this hellish place.</t5127>
<t5128>We sat waiting in silence, a profound silence that made me feel as if I could clearly hear the lamenting cries of the spirits beneath the ground.</t5128> <t5129>I suddenly started when I heard the soft whisper of the professor: "Shh... shh shh!" He raised his hand, pointing towards a shadowy figure, white like mist, that had suddenly appeared among the red-fruited pine trees and was moving towards us.</t5129>
<t5130>Yes, a figure dressed in white was holding something dark against its chest.</t5130><t5131>The floating figure suddenly stopped just as the moon unexpectedly appeared between two dark clouds: it was a woman draped in a shroud.</t5131><t5132>We couldn't clearly see her face, as she was bowing her head over what she was holding in her arms.</t5132><t5133>In the dim moonlight, we immediately recognized a blonde-haired child.</t5133><t5134>We were startled when we heard a shrill cry in the moonlit night.</t5134><t5135>The sound was like a child waking up startled from sleep, or a dog panicking in a dream near a fire.</t5135><t5136>We were about to leap towards her, but Van Helsing, who was still hiding behind a pine tree within our sight, signaled us to stop.</t5136><t5137>The white figure continued to move as the clouds covered the sliver of the moon.</t5137><t5138>In a flash, she appeared right before our eyes.</t5138><t5139>Under the moonlight that once again unexpectedly shone through the clouds, her face became quite clear.</t5139><t5140>My heart seemed to stop, and at the same time, I heard Arthur's terrified cry: we had just recognized the familiar features of Lucy.</t5140><t5141>Lucy Westenra, but how had she changed so much?</t5141><t5142>The gentleness we once knew in her had given way to hardness, cruelty, and malice.</t5142><t5143>The once innocent face was now deeply marked by carnal desire.</t5143><t5144>Van Helsing stepped out from his hiding place, and we sprang up, the four of us standing guard at the entrance of the tomb. Van Helsing opened the lantern's lid, raising it to chest height, letting the light shine on the woman before us.</t5144><t5145>My God! Her lips were wet with fresh blood, yes, blood was flowing down her chin and dripping onto her collar.</t5145><t5146>Once again, we felt a chilling shiver.</t5146><t5147>In the flickering lantern light, I knew even Professor Van Helsing's steely nerves were somewhat shaken.</t5147><t5148>Arthur stood beside me, and if I hadn't rushed to support him, he would have collapsed to the ground.</t5148>
<t5149>Meanwhile, Lucy - I call the figure standing before me Lucy, for she bears Lucy's form - stepped back and let out an angry snarl, like a trapped rat, casting a resentful gaze from one person to another.</t5149> <t5150>In appearance and color, those were indeed Lucy's eyes, but the gaze was not; the innocence and gentleness in the eyes of the girl I once loved had been replaced by the lecherous and spiteful fire of hell.</t5150> <t5151>Whatever remnants of my love instantly transformed into a feeling of hatred and disgust.</t5151> <t5152>I suddenly wanted to be the one to end her sinful existence with my own hands. With the same fierce and malicious look, she let out a twisted, naive, and lewd laugh.</t5152> <t5153>Looking at her made me feel nauseous!...</t5153> <t5154>And with the action of a she-devil, she unexpectedly threw the child she had been holding all this time to the ground in front of her, letting out a growl that was both angry and regretful. She looked just like a starving dog forced to give up a juicy bone.</t5154>
<t5155>The child let out a terrified scream and then lay still, continuously moaning.</t5155> <t5156>The heartlessness of her action as she threw the child to the ground made Arthur gasp in pain.</t5156> <t5157>After that inhumane act, she slowly advanced towards Arthur: she was still smiling that seductive, inviting smile, extending her hands forward, her eyes sparkling as she looked at her past lover.</t5157> <t5158>Arthur could only retreat, covering his face in fear with both hands.</t5158>
<t5159>But she still walked slowly forward, calling my friend's name as she went. Her voice sounded melodious, as if it didn't belong to this world, and her hands swayed as if caressing the void:</t5159>
<t5160>— Come to me, Arthur. Don't follow your friends anymore, come to me.</t5160> <t5161>I want to hold you in my loving arms! Come here!</t5161> <t5162>From now on, we will rest together! Oh, come here, my husband! Come to me!</t5162>
<t5163>The woman's gentle yet eerie voice, like the clinking sound of glass colliding, kept resonating, resonating in my head.</t5163> <t5164>Meanwhile, Arthur seemed to be enchanted, his hands no longer covering his face but spreading wide as if to welcome her.</t5164> <t5165>Seizing the moment, the lascivious woman immediately rushed into the arms of the bewitched man as if seeking a safe haven.</t5165> <t5166>But at that very moment, Van Helsing jumped out, blocking her path with a golden cross held out in front of her.</t5166> <t5167>The immortal instantly recoiled, her face twitching in a fit of frantic rage, she leaped aside and quickly ran towards the mausoleum as if to hide inside.</t5167>
<t5168>But when she was only one or two steps away from the mausoleum door, she suddenly halted, as if an irresistible invisible force had prevented her from moving further.</t5168> <t5169>Unable to do anything else, she quickly turned back to look at us, her eyes glaring fiercely under the clear moonlight and the lantern light held by the old professor.</t5169> <t5170>Never before had I seen such a face, both mournful and indifferent.</t5170> <t5171>I hope no one will ever have to witness such a face again.</t5171> <t5172>Her cheeks, which had been rosy just moments ago, now turned a pale gray; only her eyes remained the same, full of resentment and darkness, just like the eyes of someone who had escaped from hell.</t5172> <t5173>Her forehead was deeply furrowed with winding wrinkles like worms or snakes, and her mouth, with its sensuous, blood-red lips, was agape in a square shape, looking just like the masks symbolizing anger in Turkish or Japanese culture.</t5173> <t5174>If ever there was a face that announced a death sentence, or if there were looks capable of killing, then we had right in front of us such a face and such a look.</t5174>
<t5175>In front of me, she still stood defiantly between the golden crucifix that Van Helsing was holding in his hand on one side, and the mausoleum with its doors sealed shut with holy wafers on the other.</t5175> <t5176>After about half a minute, the old professor suddenly broke the silence by asking Arthur:</t5176>
<t5177>— Speak up, my friend...</t5177> <t5178>Answer me, should I continue with the work?</t5178>
<t5179>Arthur fell to his knees, covering his face with his hands, and answered in a choked sob:</t5179>
<t5180>— Just do as you have planned...</t5180> <t5181>Go ahead and do as you have planned...</t5181> <t5182>There will never be anything more terrible than this.</t5182>
<t5183>His sobs had now turned into painful groans, and if Quincey and I hadn't come to support him, he might have collapsed.</t5183>
<t5184>Van Helsing placed the lantern on the ground and walked towards the mausoleum door, for some reason he removed the layers of talismans from the door crevice.</t5184> <t5185>And when he stepped aside, we couldn't help but be astonished and horrified by the scene unfolding before our eyes: the woman, in flesh and blood, easily slipped through a narrow door crevice that I thought even a knife blade would have difficulty fitting through, let alone something thicker.</t5185> <t5186>However, we were somewhat relieved when we saw the professor calmly resealing the door crevices with the powder fragments as before.</t5186>
<t5187>The moment he ran out to pick up the child and told us:</t5187>
<t5188>— Perhaps we should go back.</t5188> <t5189>We can't do anything right now.</t5189> <t5190>It's almost dawn, and there's another funeral at noon; we have to wait until they're done.</t5190> <t5191>We will be there when the gravedigger locks the cemetery gate.</t5191> <t5192>There are still many things to do, but it will be completely different from what we've been worrying about.</t5192> <t5193>As for this boy, it doesn't seem too serious; he might recover by tomorrow night.</t5193> <t5194>Now, here's the plan: we'll leave the boy somewhere the police can easily find him, just like the previous victim, and then we'll go back together.</t5194> <t5195>Arthur, - he said, comforting him as he walked closer - I know the reality before you is horrifying, but later, when you look back, you'll understand that everything we're doing now is very necessary.</t5195> <t5196>The bitter moments I've just described, and the ones you're living through now, thank God, will soon pass, and you'll have the most peaceful years, even if it's not complete happiness.</t5196> <t5197>I won't let you struggle with your inner sorrows forever.</t5197>
<t5198>I took Arthur and Quincey to my house.</t5198> <t5199>On the way, we did not forget to encourage and console each other!</t5199> <t5200>We had to leave the boy in a place where the police could easily recognize him before going home.</t5200> <t5201>So tired! That day, the three of us fell into a fitful sleep.</t5201>
<t5202>• September 29</t5202>
<t5203>Around nearly two o'clock in the afternoon, we arrived at the hotel to find the professor.</t5203> <t5204>The strange thing was that none of us, without any prior agreement, were all dressed in black.</t5204> <t5205>Clearly, we were somewhat haunted by what had just happened, because Arthur was in mourning, but the rest of us were not affected at all.</t5205> <t5206>About an hour and a half later, we arrived at the cemetery but only dared to wander around the small secluded paths to avoid being seen before the cemetery gates were locked.</t5206> <t5207>Today, Van Helsing had replaced the small black bag he had carried on previous occasions with a much longer leather bag, looking just like a cricket bat case.</t5207> <t5208>I guessed the bag must contain a lot of things.</t5208>
<t5209>Waiting for the last footsteps to leave the cemetery and being sure that we were the only ones left, we followed the professor towards the Westenra tomb, without anyone saying a word to each other.</t5209> <t5210>He took out the key to open the door and signaled for me to close it, as I was the last one to enter.</t5210> <t5211>He lit a lantern, then lit two more candles and placed them at the heads of the two coffins beside us.</t5211> <t5212>It seemed like this time he needed more light.</t5212> <t5213>As before, he lifted the lid of Lucy's coffin and set the square piece of lead aside, in our presence.</t5213> <t5214>Poor Arthur, he trembled like a leaf when he recognized the familiar form of the woman lying inside.</t5214> <t5215>Yes, that woman lying in the coffin looked fresher and more stunningly beautiful than ever.</t5215> <t5216>But I knew in my heart there was no room for love, only a simmering hatred, a hatred kindled by the entity bearing Lucy's familiar form but devoid of any soul.</t5216> <t5217>It seemed Arthur had tried to calm himself, for I saw him ask Van Helsing:</t5217>
<t5218>— Is this truly Lucy's body, or just a demon taking her form?</t5218>
<t5219>— That is her body and yet not her body.</t5219> <t5220>But just wait a moment, and you will see the truth of the matter.</t5220>
<t5221>But anyway, we still felt like we were living in a "Lucy nightmare."</t5221> <t5222>In front of us was a woman with sharp teeth, blood-red seductive lips that alone were enough to make me shudder in fear and my body filled with carnal desire, her face exuding a savage, ghostly look, like a grotesque mockery of the gentle innocence and purity of the former Lucy.</t5222>
<t5223>As a habit, Van Helsing began to take out the tools from his bag and lay them out.</t5223> <t5224>First were the items used as welding tools, then a small wooden stake about three feet long with a sharp end, and finally a hammer.</t5224> <t5225>For me, someone accustomed to dissection work, witnessing a doctor preparing to act was not burdensome at all, but for Arthur and Quincey, it was different; it was clear that they were very tense when they saw the tools Van Helsing brought.</t5225> <t5226>However, they still showed courage, remained calm, and kept silent.</t5226>
<t5227>After arranging the tools, Van Helsing turned to us and said:</t5227>
<t5228>— Before starting the work, I would like to explain to you some additional details.</t5228><t5229>In fact, my knowledge is not extensive nor profound; it is derived from science and the experiences of the ancients, or from those who have diligently researched the powers of the immortal.</t5229><t5230>The state of not dying is always associated with the curse of immortal destiny.</t5230><t5231>These entities cannot die; fate and they always seek to create new victims, new calamities for the earth from century to century, because if anyone dies as the prey of an immortal, they will surely become another immortal.</t5231><t5232>And so, the new immortal will seek new prey to spread more disasters.</t5232><t5233>The circle of calamity keeps growing, growing, like the circles on the water's surface when a stone is thrown into the lake.</t5233><t5234>My friend Arthur, if that day you had kissed your girlfriend for a moment before she passed away to fulfill her wish, or if last night you had let her fall into your arms, sooner or later you would have shared the same fate, specifically becoming a nosferatu as the Eastern Europeans call it.</t5234><t5235>And surely, year after year, you would become the cause of new immortal entities, terrifying many people.</t5235><t5236>Fortunately, the wretched life of the unwilling immortal Lucy has just begun.</t5236><t5237>The kids she sucked blood from have not yet fallen into a state of despair, but if that immortal continues to "live," the kids will lose more and more blood, as they must obey the power she has cast upon them, and they will increasingly seek her out.</t5237><t5238>Her filthy mouth will suck the last drops of blood from the children.</t5238><t5239>On the contrary, if she truly dies, all crimes will be stopped, the minor wounds on the children's necks will disappear, and they will return to their daily games, forgetting all those dangerous adventures.</t5239><t5240>But more importantly, true death will come to the immortal, and her haunted soul will be freed.</t5240><t5241>Instead of committing evil deeds in the dark and enduring increasing disgrace, she will be granted a place in heaven with the angels.</t5241><t5242>But it requires a hand like a blessing for her.</t5242><t5243>I am very willing to do that.</t5243><t5244>But isn't there anyone among us more deserving of that privilege than me?</t5244><t5245>How happy it would be from now on, whenever we wake in the stillness of the night, to think: "She has gone to the stars thanks to my own hand, the hand of the one who loved her most in the world, the hand she would choose if she could still choose."</t5245><t5246>Tell me, friends, doesn't anyone want to have a dream with such words?</t5246>
<t5247>All of us, without saying a word, turned our eyes to Arthur, and like us, he fully understood Van Helsing's chivalrous intention.</t5247> <t5248>I understood his feelings through his gesture of reaching out to the professor.</t5248> <t5249>He stepped towards the professor, his hand trembling, his face pale:</t5249>
<t5250>— From the bottom of my heart, I sincerely thank you, a friend, a true friend of mine.</t5250> <t5251>Tell me what to do, I will calmly follow your instructions.</t5251>
<t5252>— Hooray for the young man!</t5252> <t5253>You just need to be brave for a moment, just a moment, that's enough! The issue is that you have to drive this small stake through the body.</t5253> <t5254>I repeat that this is indeed the most terrible challenge of your life, but it will be over quickly.</t5254> <t5255>And the joy you will receive will be much greater than the pain you have endured.</t5255> <t5256>In just a moment, when you leave here, you will feel like a person with wings.</t5256> <t5257>However, just a bit of hesitation and you won't accomplish anything.</t5257> <t5258>Think that we are standing here, beside you, and always praying for you in these most terrible moments.</t5258>
<t5259>— Alright, what do I have to do? - Arthur replied, choking up.</t5259>
<t5260>— You hold this stake in your left hand, with the tip of the stake aimed directly at her heart, and in your right hand, hold this hammer.</t5260> <t5261>When I recite the prayers for the souls, I will be holding the prayer book here, and when I read, the two of you should chant along, and you must, in the name of God, drive the hammer into the stake.</t5261> <t5262>Only by doing so will your beloved girl find peace and the immortal being within her body be forever banished from this world!</t5262>
<t5263>Arthur resolutely held the stake and hammer; clearly, once he decided to act, he was no longer trembling or hesitant.</t5263> <t5264>Van Helsing began to open the Bible and read, Quincey and I tried to chant along.</t5264> <t5265>Arthur precisely placed the tip of the stake on Lucy, where the heart no longer held the passionate love of a demure girl as in his memories, and with all his strength, he drove each blow, each blow decisively.</t5265>
<t5266>The corpse in the coffin began to shake, struggling and writhing incessantly, and from her crimson lips suddenly came a hoarse, guttural cry that made one's heart stop.</t5266> <t5267>Her sharp teeth bit tightly into her sensual lips until they bled.</t5267> <t5268>Arthur continued to drive the stake, even though for a moment he seemed to lose his courage, letting the hammer fall slack in his hand, but only for a moment.</t5268> <t5269>I noticed a stream of blood flowing from the wretched heart of the immortal being down below.</t5269>
<t5270>The corpse gradually stopped shaking violently and writhing in agony; only her face still twitched intermittently, and her teeth remained clenched on her lip.</t5270> <t5271>It took a while before the corpse truly became a corpse: it lay completely motionless and showed no signs of being an immortal.</t5271> <t5272>Thus, the terrifying task that seemed impossible was accomplished!</t5272>
<t5273>Arthur dropped the hammer, staggering unsteadily, and if we hadn't rushed to support him, he would have collapsed to the ground.</t5273> <t5274>He was panting, sweat beading on his forehead.</t5274> <t5275>The effort we asked of him was clearly extraordinary; without rationality and humane consideration, he certainly couldn't have accomplished it.</t5275> <t5276>We were so focused on him that no one paid attention to the coffin anymore, but about ten minutes later, a strange, indescribable feeling suddenly surged within us, causing everyone to turn their eyes to that place.</t5276> <t5277>No one could suppress a silent cry of astonishment.</t5277> <t5278>Arthur slowly stood up, as we had to let him sit and rest to recover, and approached Lucy. The feeling of joy had replaced the constant fear and melancholy on his face.</t5278>
<t5279>Lying in the coffin was no longer the terrifying immortal, causing everyone to harbor suspicion and hatred to the point that destroying her body and soul became a priority for the most deserving among us, but rather Lucy, a Lucy with the gentle, pure face we once knew when she was alive.</t5279> <t5280>The contemplation, the sadness, and the true pain of the everyday Lucy had now returned to that face.</t5280> <t5281>The feeling of affection also returned to us.</t5281> <t5282>We suddenly understood that from now on, that face would bring us complete tranquility, a peaceful life filled with memories of joy and sorrow.</t5282> <t5283>Her physical and spiritual resurrection could only be evidence, a worldly symbol of eternal slumber.</t5283>
<t5284>At this moment, Van Helsing finally placed his hand on Arthur's shoulder and asked him:</t5284>
<t5285>— So, my friend?</t5285> <t5286>Can you forgive me now?</t5286>
<t5287>Arthur, with tears in his eyes, tightly grasped the old professor's hand and choked out:</t5287>
<t5288>— I am the one who should thank you, Van Helsing.</t5288> <t5289>God will bless you.</t5289> <t5290>You are the one who has restored the true soul to the girl I love and brought me peace!</t5290>
<t5291>Arthur could only say that much before he buried his head in the man's shoulder, crying and sobbing with heart-wrenching gasps.</t5291> <t5292>Van Helsing waited for him to lift his face before speaking:</t5292>
<t5293>— My friend, now you can embrace her tightly.</t5293> <t5294>And if you wish, you can place upon her sweet lips a kiss that she has long awaited.</t5294> <t5295>Now she is no longer a ghost with a grotesque smile, and she never will be again.</t5295> <t5296>Lucy is no longer an immortal, an accomplice of the devil.</t5296> <t5297>She is now truly one of God's dead, her soul has returned to Him!</t5297>
<t5298>Arthur bent down and placed a final kiss on the beloved face of the girl.</t5298> <t5299>After that, I took him and Quincey out of the mausoleum, while I had to go back in with the professor to finish the last tasks: sawing off the excess wooden stake protruding from Lucy's body and filling her mouth with garlic.</t5299> <t5300>Finally, we sealed the inner lead lining and screwed the wooden lid back onto the coffin as it was originally.</t5300> <t5301>Once done, we packed up our belongings and left.</t5301> <t5302>After locking the mausoleum door, the professor handed the key back to Arthur.</t5302>
<t5303>Outside, the sky is blue, the clouds are clear, the sunlight is abundant, and the sounds of birds chirping create a peaceful rhythm of life.</t5303> <t5304>It seems that nature and the scenery have taken on a gentler tone, quite different from usual.</t5304> <t5305>Or perhaps it is because we no longer carry the worries and sorrows that have weighed heavily on our hearts for so long.</t5305> <t5306>However, before parting ways with us, Van Helsing said:</t5306>
<t5307>— So the first part, which can also be said to be the most difficult part, of our work has been completed.</t5307> <t5308>But my friends, we still have another task that, in some respects, is no less important: that is to identify the culprit who caused Lucy's misfortune and to make him disappear from this world forever.</t5308> <t5309>To a certain extent, I have obtained a few keys to assist in this search.</t5309> <t5310>But please also be aware that the work will be prolonged and even very dangerous.</t5310> <t5311>Will you help me? But first, what I need from you now is still faith.</t5311> <t5312>We will get to the bottom of this matter, won't we?</t5312>
<t5313>We each shook his hand with a promise to offer our sincerest help.</t5313> <t5314>As we parted, he added:</t5314>
<t5315>— Tomorrow evening, around seven o'clock, we will go together to have dinner at our friend John's house. I would like to invite both of you, Arthur and Quincey.</t5315> <t5316>All the plans have been meticulously calculated by me, I will explain later.</t5316> <t5317>John, now come home with me first, I want to consult you on some matters.</t5317> <t5318>Tonight, I might have to go back to Amsterdam to handle some business, but I will try to be here by tomorrow afternoon.</t5318> <t5319>After that, we will start our large-scale investigation, I will thoroughly explain everything that needs to be done and what I am still suspicious about.</t5319> <t5320>But remember, once we start, there is no turning back.</t5320>
<t5321>CHAPTER 17</t5321>
<t5322>Dr. Seward's Diary (continued)</t5322>
<t5323>We had just arrived at the Berkeley Hotel when a servant hurriedly ran out to inform us that someone had sent a telegram to Van Helsing: "I am coming by train.</t5323> <t5324>Jonathan is in Whitby.</t5324> <t5325>Important news.</t5325> <t5326>Mina Harker."</t5326>
<t5327>The professor exclaimed loudly, his face very cheerful:</t5327>
<t5328>— Ah! So it turns out to be Mrs. Mina! Our ruby! But unfortunately, she arrives and I can't wait for her.</t5328> <t5329>Maybe you should take her to your house, John, and perhaps you have to go to the station to pick her up.</t5329> <t5330>I will send her a telegram to let her know.</t5330>
<t5331>After sending the telegram, he made tea while talking to me about the diary that Jonathan Harker had written during his days abroad.</t5331> <t5332>He gave me a copy of his diary and one written in Whitby by Mina, both of which had been very clearly typed out.</t5332>
<t5333>— Take it and read it, read it very carefully, my friend.</t5333> <t5334>Make sure that by tomorrow night, when I come back, you know all the details in these two diaries.</t5334> <t5335>After that, we will start studying each issue.</t5335> <t5336>But you must keep these papers carefully, they are all treasures.</t5336> <t5337>I also want to remind you that from now on, you must have absolute faith, even though you have experienced things that at first seemed unbelievable and impossible to trust.</t5337> <t5338>For you, for me, and for many others, the story told here - he said, placing his hand on the stack of papers - could be the beginning of an end, or it could be the death knell of the immortal being preparing to destroy life on this earth.</t5338> <t5339>I want you not to overlook any detail, and if you can clarify something you have contemplated, please do so, because somewhere that is the most important thing we must aim for.</t5339> <t5340>It seems you also have a diary recording at least more than one surprising event that has happened, right?</t5340> <t5341>If so, in the coming days, we will together find a thread connecting the disparate events related to the overall picture of reality.</t5341>
<t5342>The passage where he prepares to leave for Amsterdam.</t5342> <t5343>As for me, I had to go to Paddington to pick up Mina Harker. I arrived about fifteen minutes before the train was due to arrive.</t5343> <t5344>The train arrived, and passengers quickly dispersed in various directions.</t5344> <t5345>While anxiously waiting, fearing that the guest might get lost, I suddenly recognized a beautiful and elegant young woman approaching me.</t5345>
<t5346>— Excuse me, are you Dr. Seward?</t5346>
<t5347>— And you are Mrs. Harker, Mina Harker?</t5347>
<t5348>The young woman happily extended her hand to me.</t5348>
<t5349>— I recognized you from Lucy's description...</t5349>
<t5350>She suddenly stammered and stopped, her face turning red.</t5350>
<t5351>I also blushed with embarrassment, but that made us feel more comfortable, as it was, after all, a tacit response to what she had just reminded us of.</t5351> <t5352>I carried the guest's luggage, which included a typewriter, and led her to the subway station on Fenchurch Street. Upon arrival, I telegraphed home to ask the housekeeper to prepare a private room for Harker.</t5352>
<t5353>I returned home at the scheduled time.</t5353> <t5354>Harker immediately recognized that my place was a mental hospital, but that did not deter her from hesitating when stepping through the door.</t5354> <t5355>As soon as she entered the house, without even having a chance to sit down, she said that if it was not inconvenient for me, she would go straight to my office, as she had many things to discuss with me.</t5355> <t5356>While waiting for her to arrange her luggage, I took the opportunity to record my diary on the tape recorder.</t5356> <t5357>To be honest, I wasn't at all enthusiastic about having to read the pile of papers that Van Helsing had just handed over, which I had left on the table.</t5357> <t5358>Of course, I also had to allocate some time to read through a bit so that I could have something to ask Harker. In fact, this young woman did not yet understand how precious time was for us now, nor did she know about the crucial mission awaiting us.</t5358>
<t5359>Mina Harker's Diary</t5359>
<t5360>• September 29</t5360>
<t5361>After hastily packing my belongings, I immediately went down to Seward's office.</t5361> <t5362>I hesitated to knock on the door, as it seemed the doctor was seeing someone inside.</t5362> <t5363>However, I remembered that he had told me earlier to come see him as soon as I was done, so I boldly knocked on the door.</t5363> <t5364>He responded right away: "Come in!" Strangely, he was alone in the room, but when I looked at the table, I immediately guessed that he had just spoken into a recording device that I had never seen before, only heard about from others.</t5364> <t5365>The device instantly captured my attention.</t5365>
<t5366>— I hope I didn't keep you waiting for long.</t5366> <t5367>- I said - Actually, I have been standing outside the door for a while, but I heard you talking and thought you had a guest.</t5367>
<t5368>— Oh! I'm just keeping a diary.</t5368> <t5369>- He replied with a laugh.</t5369>
<t5370>— Diary?</t5370>
<t5371>— Yes, here it is, the diary is right here.</t5371> <t5372>— He said while placing his hand on the tape recorder.</t5372>
<t5373>— What? - I asked in surprise - If that's the case, it's even better than my shorthand trick!</t5373> <t5374>Can I listen to a segment?</t5374>
<t5375>— Of course!</t5375>
<t5376>Seward enthusiastically stood up, intending to run the machine for a test, but for some reason, he stopped, looking very hesitant:</t5376>
<t5377>— Actually... up until now, I have only... only recorded things related to my patients, all funny things... I mean, what I want to say is...</t5377>
<t5378>The young man stammered, unable to explain his sudden change of mind.</t5378> <t5379>Seeing this, I had to choose my words carefully to steer the conversation to another topic to ease his discomfort.</t5379>
<t5380>— You were with Lucy in her final days. - I said. - Please tell me everything related to her death, I want to know everything about her life.</t5380> <t5381>You know, Lucy was my best friend.</t5381>
<t5382>I was very surprised when I caught a glimpse of the panic on his face.</t5382>
<t5383>— Tell me about her death?</t5383> <t5384>No matter what, I can't tell you!</t5384>
<t5385>— Why not? - I pressed, suddenly feeling a vague sense of fear in my heart.</t5385>
<t5386>Seward did not answer immediately.</t5386> <t5387>I understand you are trying to find some reason.</t5387>
<t5388>— You see, - He said after a moment of thought - it's really hard for me to find any diary entry related to Lucy in there...</t5388>
<t5389>He started to speak but then stopped halfway.</t5389> <t5390>It seemed like a thought had just flashed through his mind, because I noticed his tone suddenly changed, sounding more sincere, even as innocent as a child's voice:</t5390>
<t5391>— That's right! That's it!</t5391>
<t5392>I burst out laughing at his innocence.</t5392>
<t5393>— This time, can I be honest with you?</t5393> <t5394>Do you know, ever since I started keeping a diary, I have never thought about how I would retrieve a specific entry when needed.</t5394>
<t5395>Hearing him speak evasively, I suddenly realized that the diary of a doctor who had cared for Lucy in her final days must contain some important details that I needed to supplement what I already knew.</t5395> <t5396>Therefore, I immediately suggested:</t5396>
<t5397>— Doctor, if that's the case, may I transfer the entire contents of the diary from the machine to paper using a typewriter?</t5397>
<t5398>Seward vehemently refused, his face suddenly turning pale:</t5398>
<t5399>— No! No! No! I can't do that, I can't let her know that terrible story!</t5399>
<t5400>Thus, the story seems much more terrifying than I had imagined.</t5400> <t5401>My intuition completely sensed that.</t5401> <t5402>While deep in thought, I unconsciously glanced around the room, hoping to find some reason that could help me persuade the young doctor in one way or another, and my eyes suddenly stopped at a stack of typewritten papers on the table.</t5402> <t5403>Seward also followed my gaze.</t5403> <t5404>I had the impression that he had guessed my intention.</t5404>
<t5405>— Perhaps you haven't had the chance to know me.</t5405> <t5406>- I said.</t5406> <t5407>- I hope that when you finish reading that pile of papers, which are the diaries of mine and my husband’s that I have retyped, you will understand me better.</t5407> <t5408>I have never hesitated to lend those diaries of my husband and me to others, but clearly, you still don't understand me... don't understand, and of course, I don't expect you to believe in me either.</t5408>
<t5409>Lucy is right, Dr. Seward must be a really nice person.</t5409> <t5410>As soon as I finished speaking, he immediately stood up and pulled out several black-painted metal tubes stored in a rather large drawer.</t5410>
<t5411>— This is exactly what you wanted.</t5411> <t5412>- He said, his face flushed.</t5412> <t5413>- The reason I didn't trust you before was because I didn't know you, that's all.</t5413> <t5414>But now, we know each other.</t5414> <t5415>Actually, I've heard about you for a long time.</t5415> <t5416>I know that Lucy has mentioned me to you before; and she has also told me about you.</t5416> <t5417>Sorry! Now please take these tapes and listen.</t5417> <t5418>The first six tapes are all about me and of course, there's nothing in them that should concern you.</t5418> <t5419>You can listen to them or not, but if you do, you'll understand me better.</t5419> <t5420>Dinner is probably almost ready.</t5420> <t5421>As for me, I might have to read these documents to learn some additional details.</t5421>
<t5422>He took the recording device to a small living room adjacent to my room and pressed play.</t5422> <t5423>I eagerly prepared to listen to the first diary entries that captured another aspect of the love story, which I had only vaguely known through Lucy's account.</t5423>
<t5424>Dr. Seward's Diary</t5424>
<t5425>• September 29</t5425>
<t5426>I was so engrossed in Jonathan and his wife's diary that I lost track of time.</t5426> <t5427>When the maid came in to announce that dinner was ready, I still hadn't seen Harker come down; I had to tell her that perhaps she was tired after a long journey and to let her rest, and to serve dinner in an hour.</t5427> <t5428>And I continued to keep my eyes glued to the lines of the diary.</t5428> <t5429>When I reached the last lines of Harker's diary, she walked in.</t5429> <t5430>She looked sad, her eyes red, not at all like the eyes I saw when I met her at the station.</t5430>
<t5431>— I hope I didn't upset you.</t5431> <t5432>- I said softly.</t5432>
<t5433>— No, no, don't say that...</t5433> <t5434>That record player is wonderful, but it's a bit cruel!</t5434> <t5435>It tells me all the sorrows you have experienced.</t5435> <t5436>I feel like I'm listening to a soul in pain, pleading for blessings from the Almighty God.</t5436> <t5437>May no one ever have to hear such sad stories again!</t5437> <t5438>You know, I can help you a bit, I will type out your entire story on paper.</t5438> <t5439>That way, from now on, no one will have to feel the throbbing beat of your heart like I do.</t5439>
<t5440>— But no one will ever know my diary anymore!</t5440> <t5441>There will be no one, never anyone.</t5441> <t5442>- I softly replied.</t5442>
<t5443>Harker placed his hand on mine and continued in a serious tone:</t5443>
<t5444>— Yes, it must be that way!</t5444>
<t5445>— But why?</t5445>
<t5446>— Why?</t5446><t5447>Because it is an indispensable part of the horrific story related to the death of poor Lucy and the events that occurred before that, because in the battle we are engaged in to eliminate the shadow of evil from this earth, we need as much information and detail as possible.</t5447><t5448>I have a feeling that while listening to your recorded diary entries, I have noticed more than one detail that you would normally never tell me.</t5448><t5449>Indeed, they have shed some light on the dark mystery that is enveloping us.</t5449><t5450>You will agree to let me help you, won't you?</t5450><t5451>I fully understand the beginning of the story, and although I have only listened to your diary up to the seventh of September, I can still guess the misfortunes that have clung to Lucy and the tragic end of her life.</t5451><t5452>Since Professor Van Helsing's visit, there has not been a moment when we have not thought about it.</t5452><t5453>My husband has gone to Whitby to gather more information, and he will return tomorrow.</t5453><t5454>I think we should not have any secrets to hide from each other; cooperating and trusting each other is the optimal way to achieve success, rather than each knowing a little and then hiding a little from each other.</t5454>
<t5455>I was a bit surprised by the courage of the young woman standing in front of me.</t5455> <t5456>Looking into her eyes, I understood that she was brave and very determined; her gaze made me feel truly reassured.</t5456>
<t5457>— Now, I can only respect your goodwill, madam. - I replied.</t5457> <t5458>- God will forgive me if I have a mistaken view of you!</t5458> <t5459>Perhaps you will learn even more terrible details! I understand that because you know a lot about Lucy's condition, you cannot help but want to know more about her tragic end.</t5459> <t5460>I assure you that once you hear the whole story about her... yes, in the end, you will feel somewhat reassured.</t5460> <t5461>Now, perhaps we should go have dinner.</t5461> <t5462>We need to maintain our health.</t5462> <t5463>After eating, you will continue to hear the rest of the story, and I will be ready to answer any details you find unclear.</t5463> <t5464>You are right, for us, everything must be clear to reach a happy ending.</t5464>
<t5465>Mina Harker's Diary</t5465>
<t5466>• September 29</t5466>
<t5467>After finishing dinner, I followed Dr. Seward into his study.</t5467> <t5468>He went to the room to get the gramophone, while I carried down the typewriter.</t5468> <t5469>He arranged a convenient spot for me on the couch so that I could type and operate the gramophone placed beside me.</t5469> <t5470>Then, he showed me how to stop the machine when I wanted to take a short break to rest.</t5470> <t5471>Once the seating arrangement was done, I turned on the machine to continue listening to his spoken diary entries.</t5471>
<t5472>Hearing about Lucy's death and what happened afterward, I collapsed into the seat, my body weak as if I had no strength left.</t5472> <t5473>Fortunately, I am not the type of person who faints at the slightest thing! However, Dr. Seward quickly ran to get a bottle of strong liquor for me to take a few sips, and only then did I regain my composure.</t5473> <t5474>But that did not stop my heart from being troubled, even though I finally heard that my dear friend Lucy had gone to be with God. I almost screamed out in anger.</t5474> <t5475>If I hadn't known about Jonathan's adventure in Transylvania, I might not have been so fearful.</t5475> <t5476>In any case, I didn't know what to think anymore, and I had to find a way to hide my inner turmoil by suggesting to the doctor:</t5476>
<t5477>— Let me retype everything you recorded in the phonograph.</t5477> <t5478>We need to be fully prepared before Dr. Van Helsing returns.</t5478> <t5479>I've already telegraphed Arthur, and he will come back here from Whitby immediately.</t5479> <t5480>In this case, dates are the most important issue.</t5480> <t5481>In my opinion, if we arrange the events in chronological order, everything will become much more manageable.</t5481> <t5482>You just mentioned that you are also waiting for Lord Godalming and Quincey Morris, so when they arrive, they should be informed of everything that has happened.</t5482>
<t5483>Hearing me, Seward immediately turned the machine back on, but this time he set it to run slower so that I could easily type out the contents of the diary from the beginning.</t5483> <t5484>I made three copies so that others could read them without wasting time waiting unnecessarily.</t5484> <t5485>Seward had to visit some patients, but he quickly returned.</t5485> <t5486>He said he needed to continue reading the remaining pages of my and my wife's diary, and moreover, he wanted someone in the room working with me to avoid feeling lonely.</t5486> <t5487>He truly is a gallant man.</t5487> <t5488>This world still seems to have many such people, but it is not without its demons.</t5488> <t5489>Before returning to my room, I suddenly remembered the diary entry that Seward mentioned about the newspapers - the latest issues of the Westminster Gazette and Pall Mall Gazette, which Jonathan had bought for Van Helsing when he was preparing to board the train at Exeter station - so I asked to borrow them to read in my room before going to sleep.</t5489> <t5490>I recalled that back home, the Dailygraph and Whitby Gazette had provided us with some very useful details for further understanding the horrific events that had occurred in Whitby when Count Dracula landed there.</t5490> <t5491>Lying in bed, I skimmed through the newspapers, hoping to find some new rays of light in them.</t5491>
<t5492>I don't feel sleepy, but it seems that the newspapers have somehow helped me become calmer.</t5492>
<t5493>Dr. Seward's Diary</t5493>
<t5494>• September 30</t5494>
<t5495>Jonathan arrived at around nine o'clock. He received a call from his wife while preparing to return from Whitby.</t5495> <t5496>Meeting him, one immediately senses that he is a very intelligent and determined man.</t5496> <t5497>If his diary is written truthfully, then he must also be a very brave person.</t5497> <t5498>For it takes an extremely courageous person to dare to venture down into the crypt of that ancient castle twice.</t5498> <t5499>After reading those lines of his narrative, I thought I would meet a very tough person, not someone with the calm demeanor and full qualities of a businessman sitting across from me having lunch.</t5499>
<t5500>• A moment later</t5500>
<t5501>After lunch, Jonathan and his wife returned to their room.</t5501> <t5502>As I passed by his door, I heard the clattering sound of a typewriter again.</t5502> <t5503>The couple truly are persistent people.</t5503> <t5504>They are piecing together the scattered events in chronological order as Mina suggested.</t5504> <t5505>Jonathan had in his hands the letters exchanged between those who received the shipments in Whitby and the Carter, Paterson & Co. company in London. He was also engrossed in reading my diary, which Mina had just finished typing.</t5505> <t5506>I wonder if they will find anything that helps clarify our issues? Ah! Here it is...</t5506>
<t5507>There is something very strange: the thought that the house with the garden adjacent to ours could be the hiding place of the old count has never crossed my mind!</t5507> <t5508>However, only God knows that the behavior of the patient Renfield is actually a link that helps us find the direction of the investigation.</t5508> <t5509>Now, we have in our hands the letters related to the purchase of the house that Jonathan brought.</t5509> <t5510>If we had known those facts a few days earlier, we might have saved Lucy! But anyway, what's done is done!...</t5510> <t5511>Jonathan is still buried in his work.</t5511> <t5512>At dinner, the couple summarized for us the logic of the seemingly very disparate events that had occurred.</t5512> <t5513>According to Jonathan, I will understand the whole issue if I keep an eye on Renfield, as he is an unconscious signal indicating the comings and goings of the old count.</t5513> <t5514>I have not yet visualized the possibility of this matter, but it may be possible when comparing the dates.</t5514> <t5515>Fortunately, Mina has transcribed my diary onto paper, otherwise we would never have paid attention to the dates that make up the chain of events!</t5515>
<t5516>When I visited Renfield, he was sitting quietly in a corner of the room.</t5516> <t5517>Seeing me enter, he gave a very gentle smile.</t5517> <t5518>At that moment, I had the feeling that he was completely sane like a normal person.</t5518> <t5519>I sat down and talked to him about countless things, and he responded to me just like a person with a sound mind.</t5519> <t5520>Then he suddenly mentioned that he wanted to go home - something he had never mentioned since he was admitted to the institution.</t5520> <t5521>I believe that if it weren't for the conversation with Jonathan and hadn't read the letters he had in his possession, or hadn't reviewed the dates when Renfield had his fits, I would have discharged him in the next few days.</t5521> <t5522>But to be honest, from a logical standpoint, I still can't understand what happened.</t5522> <t5523>Let's say that Renfield's fits coincided with the appearance of the count at the neighboring house, but what is his current state of mind?</t5523> <t5524>Could it be that "vampires" have such great power? I can't forget how Renfield ravenously chewed on both flies and live spiders, and in a fit of madness, he went to the door of the abandoned house and shouted "master".</t5524> <t5525>This could confirm our hypothesis.</t5525> <t5526>If so, I must keep him here.</t5526> <t5527>He seems lucid enough to answer questions that he might guess my purpose: to understand more about the count.</t5527> <t5528>He has never been this clear-headed!...</t5528> <t5529>Yes, I will keep him here.</t5529> <t5530>I suddenly feel suspicious when he is obedient.</t5530> <t5531>I must remind the warden to keep an eye on him and restrain him with a very secure straitjacket.</t5531>
<t5532>Jonathan Harker's Journal</t5532>
<t5533>• September 29</t5533>
<t5534>I wrote a diary on the train to London. When Billington enthusiastically promised to provide me with all the information he had, I immediately thought I would get lucky in Whitby.</t5534> <t5535>In fact, now I just want to know exactly one place in London that received the count's shady shipment.</t5535> <t5536>Billington's son, a kind-hearted young man, waited to pick me up at the station.</t5536>
<t5537>They arranged for me to sleep overnight at their house.</t5537> <t5538>There, I was warmly welcomed in the unique Yorkshire way and allowed to do whatever I wanted.</t5538> <t5539>Knowing that I had to handle many tasks in a very short time, Billington had prepared all the documents related to the shipment of the dubious crates for me.</t5539> <t5540>I suddenly shuddered when I recognized one of the letters that I had seen on the Count's desk on the day I was still unaware of his dark plans.</t5540> <t5541>He had thought through every situation very carefully, acting with precision and method.</t5541> <t5542>It seemed he had anticipated every obstacle that might arise during the execution of his scheme.</t5542>
<t5543>To present himself in the American business style, he "did not accept any risk" regarding the shipment, and the precision he demanded in the shipping instructions was merely the result of an extremely careful calculation for a shady deal.</t5543> <t5544>I noticed that the special delivery invoice had the line: Fifty boxes of soil commonly used for experiments.</t5544> <t5545>The landlord Billington also showed me a copy of the letter sent to the Carter, Paterson & Co. company and the reply from this company.</t5545> <t5546>Billington gave me a copy of the two letters.</t5546> <t5547>Knowing that this was the only information he could provide, I went down to the port to ask some security guards, customs officers, and the port manager.</t5547> <t5548>All of them had something to say about the unusual docking of the mysterious ship, which had now become a local legend.</t5548> <t5549>However, none of them could provide even the slightest explanation about what was contained inside those wooden crates, so I had to be content with the only information recorded on the invoice: Fifty boxes of common soil.</t5549> <t5550>After that, I sought out the station master.</t5550> <t5551>Hearing my inquiry, he immediately called those who had participated in transporting those crates.</t5551> <t5552>But these people could only tell me what I couldn't be sure of: that there were fifty wooden crates, and they couldn't say anything more except that "those crates were terribly large and heavy," or "lifting them up would make you die of thirst."</t5552>
<t5553>It's truly a waste of effort!</t5553>
<t5554>• September 30</t5554>
<t5555>The station master wrote a few lines of a handwritten letter introducing me to a colleague of his at Kings Cross so that when I arrived in London this morning, I could immediately discuss with him what I wanted to know more about the wooden crates when they were unloaded here.</t5555> <t5556>For his part, he also immediately called the porters who had participated in unloading these crates for me to inquire, but these people could only say that the number of crates was fifty.</t5556> <t5557>However, no one mentioned any unusual hunger.</t5557> <t5558>But whether there was anything unusual or not, I still had to dejectedly thank these porters.</t5558>
<t5559>From Kings Cross station, I wearily made my way to the Carter, Parterson office in Cie, where they welcomed me very courteously.</t5559> <t5560>After locating my transaction records, the staff called the Kings Cross branch to ask for the exact details.</t5560> <t5561>The truck drivers had just returned from their deliveries.</t5561> <t5562>As requested, they immediately provided us with a report on the shipment.</t5562> <t5563>One of them was given a delivery note and other documents related to the transportation of the crates to Carfax.</t5563> <t5564>The number of crates here matched the number listed on the invoice.</t5564> <t5565>Additionally, the drivers agreed to provide me with any supplementary details they knew.</t5565> <t5566>The relevant details, if they can be called that, I received were merely the very unpleasant inconveniences of the job - dust and parching thirst.</t5566> <t5567>But when I let the drivers take a break and handed them a few small bills, one driver suddenly exclaimed loudly, in a thick rural accent:</t5567>
<t5568>— That house, sir, is nothing but dust, just dust!</t5568> <t5569>It’s the strangest thing I’ve ever seen in my life! I swear!</t5569> <t5570>It looks like no one has set foot in that house for a hundred years!</t5570> <t5571>The dust is inches thick! So thick... that you could lie down and sleep without worrying about a backache!</t5571> <t5572>The abandoned house is like ancient Jerusalem!</t5572> <t5573>But the creepiest part has to be the private chapel inside!...</t5573> <t5574>Oh my God! I’ve never seen anything like it! When we stepped outside, my friends and I felt like we had just come back from the dead!</t5574> <t5575>Lord!</t5575> <t5576>I couldn’t stay there for a second once it got dark!</t5576>
<t5577>Of course, I believe in his words, and I am also sure that if he knew everything I knew, he would have a much more expressive tone.</t5577>
<t5578>No matter what, I am now certain of one thing: all the crates were shipped from Varna to Whitby by the Demeter ship and then transferred to the private Carfax church.</t5578> <t5579>There were fifty crates in total, and after reading Dr. Seward's journal, I fear that since then, at least a few of them must have been used already.</t5579>
<t5580>I will try to find the truck driver who once fought with Renfield while delivering goods at Carfax.</t5580> <t5581>Following this lead, who knows, we might find something not too bad!</t5581>
<t5582>• See you later</t5582>
<t5583>Mina and I worked all day, so now all types of documents are neatly organized.</t5583>
<t5584>Mina Harker's Diary</t5584>
<t5585>• September 30</t5585>
<t5586>I felt so happy that I could temporarily be content with myself.</t5586> <t5587>Perhaps that was a normal reaction to the extreme anxiety that constantly lingered within me: I was always afraid that when reminded of the emotional wound, Jonathan would have another breakdown.</t5587> <t5588>When preparing to go to Whitby, he seemed to have completely mastered himself, but that didn't stop me from worrying to death. Thank God! All his efforts and work were carried out smoothly with the enthusiastic help of the people he needed to meet.</t5588> <t5589>I had never seen him so healthy, determined, and resolute to see things through to the end.</t5589> <t5590>The kind old professor Van Helsing was right: Jonathan is indeed a very brave person, the more difficulties and obstacles he faces, the more eager he is to confront the challenges.</t5590> <t5591>When he returned, he seemed full of hope and showed more determination.</t5591> <t5592>He helped me finish organizing the documents he had just obtained in chronological order.</t5592> <t5593>Now, everything is well-prepared.</t5593> <t5594>I feel much more relieved and excited than before.</t5594> <t5595>To be honest, at first, I wondered whether, after all, it was necessary to pity a hunted creature like the Count.</t5595> <t5596>For this creature had nothing that could be called human, yet he was not like an animal either.</t5596> <t5597>However, whenever I remember Lucy's death and the events that followed, I get infuriated!</t5597>
<t5598>• A moment later</t5598>
<t5599>Lord Godalming and Morris arrived earlier than we expected.</t5599> <t5600>Dr. Seward had to take Jonathan to visit some patients, so I was the one who directly received them.</t5600> <t5601>To be honest, I felt a bit uneasy about this, because seeing them reminded me of Lucy's hopes a few months ago! Yes, Lucy had talked to me about them many times, and I also remember that Van Helsing had once "given a speech" praising Quincey Morris.</t5601> <t5602>Poor fellows!</t5602> <t5603>They didn't understand that I knew all about each of them proposing to Lucy! It seemed they still thought I was unaware of the tragic circumstances surrounding her death, because in front of me, they only talked about the weather and other trivial matters.</t5603> <t5604>Therefore, I had to explain the current situation to them.</t5604>
<t5605>Through Seward's diary, I know that they were also present at the death - I mean the true death of Lucy, so there's nothing to keep secret here.</t5605> <t5606>I told them that my wife and I had read all the documents in our possession and typed them all out in chronological order.</t5606> <t5607>And I gave each of them a copy to read in the library.</t5607> <t5608>Lord Godalming asked me:</t5608>
<t5609>— Mrs. Harker, are you the one who typed all these documents?</t5609>
<t5610>Seeing me nod, he asked further:</t5610>
<t5611>— I am not quite clear about the purpose of everyone's actions, but I see that you are all very kind to me and very dedicated to me.</t5611> <t5612>The enthusiasm of everyone from the beginning until now seems to have brought about many results.</t5612> <t5613>Now, all I can do is trust and reciprocate everyone's help.</t5613> <t5614>I acknowledge the events and know that everyone also loves Lucy very much...</t5614>
<t5615>He suddenly bowed his head, covering his face with his hands, his voice sobbing in between the sobs.</t5615> <t5616>Morris placed his hand on his shoulder for a moment, as a gesture of comforting his distressed friend, then quietly stepped outside.</t5616> <t5617>Surely there must be something in the instinctive nature of us women that makes a man easily express his emotions and painful feelings like that without fearing to lose face.</t5617>
<t5618>Seeing that there were only the two of us left in the room, he collapsed onto the couch and didn't bother to hide the pain in his heart.</t5618> <t5619>I came over and held his hand tightly.</t5619> <t5620>I hoped that my gesture wouldn't be seen as too intimate for another man.</t5620> <t5621>And if later on, when he recalls this moment, he would never think of me that way.</t5621> <t5622>But perhaps I was overthinking, because I knew he was a gentleman, noble, and would never think that way.</t5622>
<t5623>— I also care deeply for Lucy, - I confided - and I understand the feelings she had for you as well as what you did for her.</t5623> <t5624>She and I always regarded each other as sisters.</t5624> <t5625>Now that she is no longer here, could you consider me as a sister?</t5625> <t5626>I know you have just gone through two great misfortunes in life, if my sincere feelings can somewhat ease the sorrow in your heart, please allow me to help you.</t5626>
<t5627>The poor boy suddenly burst into tears, with tears streaming down his cheeks.</t5627> <t5628>I felt so sorry for him but didn't know what to do!</t5628> <t5629>In his emotional state, he rested his head on my shoulder and sobbed like a child.</t5629>
<t5630>Just like other women, the instinct of a mother suddenly awakened in me when I encountered someone in need of protection and comfort.</t5630> <t5631>I felt that the young man sobbing on my shoulder was like a little child whom I would one day hold in my arms.</t5631> <t5632>I stroked his hair as if it were the hair of a son.</t5632>
<t5633>Finally, when he had calmed down, he slowly lifted his face and confessed that all this time, he had never had the chance to confide in anyone about the weariness and despair in his heart.</t5633> <t5634>He no longer felt interested in socializing with other girls and moreover, he couldn't have a close conversation with any girl after the recent ironic situations.</t5634>
<t5635>— I know how much I have to endure, - He said while wiping his tears - but what you did for me today is so profound that right now I cannot fully understand its value, and no one will ever understand it.</t5635> <t5636>But I can understand that one day, when I have fully grasped your actions, please believe that my gratitude towards you will be much deeper.</t5636> <t5637>From today onwards, in memory of Lucy, I would like to regard you as a sister.</t5637>
<t5638>— Yes, in memory of our Lucy. - I replied and squeezed his hand.</t5638>
<t5639>— And also because of what belongs to your humanity, - He continued - because if there is ever anyone who deserves the gratitude and respect of a man, then you are the one who has earned my complete admiration.</t5639> <t5640>If in the future, whenever you need the wholehearted help of a sincere friend, please think of me.</t5640> <t5641>God will never let you go through dark days again! But if that still happens, please let me know immediately!</t5641>
<t5642>I can completely sense the mood and seriousness in his voice, and perhaps my promise will somewhat comfort him.</t5642>
<t5643>— Yes, I promise to do so!</t5643>
<t5644>In the hallway, Morris was standing pensively in front of the window.</t5644> <t5645>As soon as he heard my footsteps, he turned and asked:</t5645>
<t5646>— How is Arthur?</t5646>
<t5647>Seeing my eyes red, he immediately spoke up:</t5647>
<t5648>— Ah! I knew you would find a way to comfort him.</t5648> <t5649>Poor guy, he really needs to be comforted! Only a woman can soothe a man's heart, and the gentle gestures of a woman can...</t5649>
<t5650>However, even Morris is not someone who can easily overcome the pain in his heart without the courage and fortitude of a resolute man.</t5650> <t5651>When I noticed a stack of typed papers in his hand, I suddenly understood that he had read what I had given him and knew that I was aware of everything.</t5651>
<t5652>— I really want to comfort everyone who has pain in their hearts! - I said.</t5652> <t5653>- Please allow me to be a friend, a friend whom you can seek out whenever you need help.</t5653> <t5654>Later on, you will understand why I said this to you.</t5654>
<t5655>Morris leaned over and kissed my hand.</t5655> <t5656>Honestly, I still felt too small and weak to be able to help such a gallant and selfless young man! I didn't know how to express my deep appreciation for him.</t5656> <t5657>Tears filled with emotion suddenly rolled down the cheeks of the poor young man, rendering him unable to say anything further.</t5657> <t5658>It took a while before he calmed down and told me:</t5658>
<t5659>— Little girl, you will never have to regret expressing your feelings to me, never!</t5659>
<t5660>Then he quietly returned to the room with his friend.</t5660>
<t5661>"Little girl..." These are indeed words laden with affection that he once used to speak to Lucy, but clearly, he also deserves to be a very close friend!</t5661>
<t5662>CHAPTER 18</t5662>
<t5663>Dr. Seward's Diary</t5663>
<t5664>I returned home at five in the afternoon, when Lord Godalming and Morris were already present and they were informed about the letters and the diaries that Jonathan and his admirable wife had meticulously copied.</t5664> <t5665>Jonathan had not yet returned; he had to visit some truck drivers that Mr. Hennessey mentioned in his letter.</t5665> <t5666>Mina made each of us a cup of tea; to be honest, since becoming a doctor, this was the first time I truly felt that this hospital was "my home".</t5666>
<t5667>While sitting and drinking tea, Mina asked me:</t5667>
<t5668>— Dr. Seward, may I make a request of you?</t5668> <t5669>I would like to meet your patient Renfield for a moment.</t5669> <t5670>What you mentioned about him in your diary has caught my attention.</t5670>
<t5671>Her voice, her eyes almost pleading, made it impossible for me to refuse.</t5671> <t5672>Besides, I saw no reason to do so.</t5672> <t5673>And I agreed to take her to meet Renfield immediately afterward.</t5673> <t5674>Entering his room, I told him that a lady wished to visit him, and he mumbled in response:</t5674>
<t5675>— For what purpose?</t5675>
<t5676>—</t5676> <t5677>She intends to visit the hospital, - I explained - and wants to interact with the inpatients to understand some issues, that's all.</t5677>
<t5678>— That's good! Then just tell her to come in!</t5678> <t5679>But wait a minute, I need to tidy up a few things first.</t5679>
<t5680>For him, cleaning up meant devouring all the flies and spiders stored in the boxes scattered around the room before anyone could stop him.</t5680> <t5681>Clearly, he was afraid of others finding out about those insects.</t5681> <t5682>After "cleaning up," he cheerfully told me:</t5682>
<t5683>— Bring her in!</t5683>
<t5684>Then he sat down on the edge of the bed, head bowed, but his eyes still tried to look up, waiting for the strange guest.</t5684> <t5685>Looking at him, I suddenly felt anxious because he could go into a deadly rage at any moment.</t5685> <t5686>I remember there was a time when he appeared completely docile in my office, yet just a few minutes later, he suddenly lunged at me as if he wanted to finish me off immediately.</t5686> <t5687>Therefore, I had to sidle up to sit next to him so that if anything happened, I could kill him before he had a chance to attack Mina.</t5687> <t5688>With his consent, Mina stepped in cheerfully and extended her hand towards him.</t5688>
<t5689>— Hello, Renfield. - She said.</t5689> <t5690>- You see, I have been informed about you, Dr. Seward has told me about you.</t5690>
<t5691>He frowned, staring intently at the strange woman and did not bother to answer immediately.</t5691> <t5692>He even showed a mix of surprise and a bit of skepticism, but he also surprised me with a question I could never have anticipated:</t5692>
<t5693>—</t5693> <t5694>Isn't she the woman the doctor here wants to marry? No, it can't be her, because that girl is already dead.</t5694>
<t5695>Mina smiled and replied:</t5695>
<t5696>— No, definitely not!</t5696> <t5697>Because I am married, we got married before I knew Dr. Seward, and at that time he had never met me.</t5697>
<t5698>— So why did you come here?</t5698>
<t5699>— My husband and I want to visit Dr. Seward's house.</t5699>
<t5700>— Don't linger at his house!</t5700>
<t5701>— Why?</t5701>
<t5702>Afraid that this kind of conversation might upset Mina, I had to choose my words carefully to steer the conversation in a different direction.</t5702>
<t5703>— How do you know I plan to get married? - I asked Renfield.</t5703>
<t5704>He responded to me with a disdainful tone, his eyes shifting from Mina to me, then immediately turning away:</t5704>
<t5705>— What a stupid question!</t5705>
<t5706>— I don't think so, Renfield! - Mina said as if to defend me.</t5706>
<t5707>Unlike his disdainful attitude when talking to me, he was very polite and respectful when conversing with Mina:</t5707>
<t5708>—</t5708> <t5709>Mrs. Harker, you must understand that for a man who is esteemed and loved like the doctor here, everything related to him concerns our small community.</t5709> <t5710>Not only do the friends who love Dr. Seward, but even some of his patients, due to their mental imbalance, can alter the nature of cause and effect.</t5710> <t5711>Since being in this asylum, I cannot help but notice that the sophistry of some inmates always tends to make them commit errors of non-causality and consequence, causing them to be confused not only due to a lack of substance awareness but also about the cause itself.</t5711>
<t5712>I stared at him in astonishment.</t5712> <t5713>He was the patient who concerned me the most, so I always understood that one of the things contributing to his condition was his frequent talk about philosophy.</t5713> <t5714>But indeed, I had never seen him speak in such a manner: he spoke as if he were a truly distinguished philosopher.</t5714> <t5715>Could Mina's presence have struck a chord in his memory? If the sudden awakening of these intellectual abilities was spontaneous, or at least stemmed from the unconscious influence of that young woman, then she must surely possess a natural talent or an unusual capability.</t5715>
<t5716>We sat and chatted for a while longer.</t5716> <t5717>Seeing that Renfield seemed pleased with his reasoning, Mina winked at me and then asked him more about the topic he liked.</t5717> <t5718>Clearly, he was surprising me more and more.</t5718> <t5719>He spoke freely like a man with full intellectual capabilities, and moreover, he used himself as an example to prove what he wanted to demonstrate.</t5719>
<t5720>— If you pay attention, you will see in me a very different essence.</t5720> <t5721>I say this without jest, it is not surprising that my relatives always show concern for me and place me under their supervision.</t5721> <t5722>Occasionally, I still imagine life as a practical, eternal entity, and by consuming countless living entities, even those at the bottom of the creation ladder, one can extend their life indefinitely.</t5722> <t5723>I have always believed in immortality, to the extent that there will come a time when I must truly prove myself to be a man.</t5723> <t5724>Surely, there will be a time when the doctor here will tell you that there was once a moment when I intended to kill him to rejuvenate myself, I mean to say that I would attain immortality by absorbing his very blood, because I remember a verse in the Bible: “The blood flows, that is life.”</t5724> <t5725>Yet the physicians have deliberately trivialized this obvious truth to the point where he deserves to be spat in the face.</t5725> <t5726>Am I right, doctor?</t5726>
<t5727>I nodded slightly, feeling very astonished to be able to find a word or even a thought about what he had just explained.</t5727> <t5728>Could this really be a man who, just five minutes ago, had swallowed who knows how many flies and spiders!...</t5728> <t5729>I glanced at the clock, as it was time to go to the station to pick up Van Helsing.</t5729> <t5730>Seeing me mention it, Mina immediately stood up to leave with me, but before stepping out the door, she smiled and said to Renfield:</t5730>
<t5731>— Goodbye!</t5731> <t5732>I hope that I will be able to visit you often on suitable occasions!</t5732>
<t5733>Renfield's answer once again made me ponder:</t5733>
<t5734>— Goodbye, dear... or rather, may God ensure that I never have to see your charming face again.</t5734> <t5735>May He protect you and bless you!</t5735>
<t5736>I went to the station alone, leaving Arthur at home with Quincey.</t5736> <t5737>Today, Arthur seemed happier than he had been since his Lucy passed away.</t5737> <t5738>Meanwhile, Quincey also became much more cheerful with the new friend Mina Harker to talk to.</t5738>
<t5739>As soon as the train stopped, Van Helsing quickly jumped onto the platform like a young man.</t5739> <t5740>Seeing me, he hurried over, shouting loudly:</t5740>
<t5741>— Ah! John, how are you, still well? Good! As for me, when I was in Amsterdam, I took the opportunity to take care of everything so I could stay here for a long time if necessary.</t5741> <t5742>I have a lot to talk to you about.</t5742> <t5743>Is Mina at your house?</t5743> <t5744>Great! And how is her dear husband doing? And Arthur and Quincey?</t5744> <t5745>Are they all at your house too? Wonderful!</t5745>
<t5746>On the way home, I took the opportunity to tell him everything that had happened since he returned to the country, including the story of how my diary suddenly became useful when Mina typed it up and organized it in chronological order.</t5746>
<t5747>— Oh my! This Miss Harker keeps surprising me more and more every day!</t5747> <t5748>She truly has the mind of a man, a man with natural talent, but carries within her the gentle heart of a woman! I tell you, don't laugh, God created her: it must be for some special divine purpose.</t5748> <t5749>My dear friend, fortune has brought her here to help us.</t5749> <t5750>However, after today, we should not let her get involved in this dreadful story anymore.</t5750> <t5751>Otherwise, she will have to face unforeseeable dangers.</t5751> <t5752>We have promised each other that the destruction of that demon is our task, the task of brave men, not of a woman, right?</t5752> <t5753>Even if she doesn't encounter any risk, her compassionate heart shouldn't have to endure the pressures of one horror after another.</t5753> <t5754>In any case, we must not allow her to have nights full of nightmares in the future.</t5754> <t5755>Moreover, since she is still young and has just gotten married, if not now then soon, she will have many things to arrange.</t5755> <t5756>You just said she has typed all the documents, so she has already participated quite a lot with us.</t5756> <t5757>Tomorrow, you should tell her to rest! Don't let her do any more work.</t5757> <t5758>We will continue the work ourselves without letting her...</t5758>
<t5759>I completely agree with the professor's opinion and inform him of what we have just discovered during his absence: the house that Count Dracula bought is the one adjacent to the grounds of my asylum. Van Helsing seemed very surprised, but could not hide his worried expression.</t5759>
<t5760>— Oh my God! Why didn't we know sooner? - He lamented. - If we had known earlier, we could have saved Lucy!</t5760> <t5761>But never mind, it's all in the past now, we shouldn't dwell on it, the issue now is to try our best to reach that final goal!</t5761>
<t5762>He suddenly fell silent and remained that way until they got home.</t5762> <t5763>Before going upstairs to take off his coat and prepare for dinner, he said to Mina:</t5763>
<t5764>— Our friend John here has told me that you and your husband have taken the trouble to type up and organize all the documents related to what we know about Count Dracula up to this point.</t5764>
<t5765>— Not at this moment, professor, but precisely this morning.</t5765>
<t5766>— So, what's the difference?</t5766> <t5767>In the end, it's still a bit of light illuminating the facts, even if those facts seem the least important on the surface.</t5767> <t5768>We've all shared everything we know with each other, haven't we?</t5768>
<t5769>Mina blushed and took a piece of paper out of her pocket:</t5769>
<t5770>— Professor, could you read this note and see if I should continue? This is what I recorded today.</t5770> <t5771>Continuing to meticulously record what happens from now on might still be useful.</t5771> <t5772>I don't think there's anything personal here.</t5772> <t5773>Should I continue?</t5773>
<t5774>After reading the note, Van Helsing spoke while handing it back to Mina:</t5774>
<t5775>— This won't support other documents much if you don't want it to.</t5775> <t5776>However, for my part, I still think it's the right thing to do.</t5776> <t5777>Your husband can only feel more love for you, and through your actions, he will perceive that the appreciation and friendship we, his true friends, have for you can only grow each day.</t5777>
<t5778>Mina blushed shyly again, taking back the piece of paper from the old professor's hand with a radiant smile on her face.</t5778>
<t5779>So up until now, all of our notes have been completed and neatly organized.</t5779> <t5780>Van Helsing took a copy to ponder over after dinner, as we waited for the meeting at eight o'clock.</t5780> <t5781>After thoroughly studying all the documents in hand, he will plan with us the course of action against that mysterious and terrifying enemy.</t5781>
<t5782>Mina Harker's Diary</t5782>
<t5783>• September 30</t5783>
<t5784>About two hours after dinner, we gathered in Dr. Seward's study.</t5784> <t5785>Our meeting was like that of a council or some official committee.</t5785> <t5786>Professor Van Helsing sat at the head of the table as the chairperson, and he asked me to sit on his right to serve as the secretary for the group.</t5786> <t5787>Jonathan sat next to me.</t5787> <t5788>Sitting opposite my husband and me were Arthur and Morris - Arthur sat next to the professor, and Dr. Seward sat next to Morris.</t5788>
<t5789>Seeing that everyone was already seated, Professor Van Helsing began the meeting:</t5789>
<t5790>— If I am not mistaken, everyone is already fully aware of all the related events recorded in the diary and personal letters, right?</t5790>
<t5791>Waiting for us to nod in response, he continued:</t5791>
<t5792>— I think it is also necessary to inform you more about the enemy we are facing.</t5792> <t5793>Please bear with me as I explain some points about the man whom I am now completely certain about.</t5793> <t5794>After that, we will discuss together to find the best course of action with the most appropriate measures possible.</t5794> <t5795>First, I affirm that "vampires" truly exist in this world, simply because some of us have accidentally obtained evidence! Even if we hadn't gone through the painful reality just now, the past would still provide us with enough evidence to conclude their existence.</t5795> <t5796>To be honest, at first, I didn't believe it either.</t5796> <t5797>For many years, if I hadn't forced myself to broaden my perspective on the world and life, I would never have believed in this seemingly mythical story until a thunderbolt struck my ears: "See!</t5797> <t5798>I will make you see!</t5798> <t5799>I will give you undeniable evidence!" That's it!</t5799> <t5800>If from the beginning, we had known everything as we do now, Lucy's precious life might not have had such a sad ending! In the end, we failed.</t5800> <t5801>Now, all our efforts can only be to save other souls.</t5801> <t5802>It should be known that this nosferatu species cannot die like bees do after injecting their venom into a person's body.</t5802> <t5803>On the contrary, it only gets stronger, and the stronger it gets, the more dangerous it becomes.</t5803> <t5804>The "vampire" we are facing has the strength of twenty men.</t5804> <t5805>He is more cunning than any similar entity, as his deceitful skills have been honed over centuries. He knows how to use necromancy, a magic in its original sense of summoning the spirits of the dead to predict the future, and all the dead can come to him at his command.</t5805> <t5806>He is extremely ruthless, and sometimes even worse than ruthlessness.</t5806> <t5807>He is a demon without humanity, without a heart in many lands, he can appear anywhere, in any form he desires.</t5807> <t5808>Even to some extent, he has the power to control the forces of nature such as summoning storms, fog, thunder, or commanding lower animals like rats, owls, bats, moths, weasels, foxes, and wolves to obey him.</t5808> <t5809>He can make himself larger or smaller, and in some cases, he can disappear as if he never existed.</t5809> <t5810>Under such conditions, how are we to find him?</t5810> <t5811>And once we find him, how can we permanently destroy him?</t5811> <t5812>It's not easy, my friends, not easy at all.</t5812> <t5813>It will be an extremely difficult and terrifying task, sometimes just thinking about the consequences of that task is enough to make the bravest man shudder.</t5813> <t5814>Why is that?</t5814> <t5815>Because if we plunge into the battle, he will surely win.</t5815> <t5816>And then what will happen?</t5816> <t5817>For me, losing my life is not scary at all.</t5817> <t5818>The problem is that our failure carries a completely different meaning from life or death: we will become heartless, unconscious beings like him, creatures of the night, and then turn the people we love most into our prey.</t5818> <t5819>The gates of heaven will never close for us, because who will open the gates for us? We will be scorned and cursed by people forever.</t5819> <t5820>That's it! The most terrible challenge is being posed.</t5820> <t5821>We are facing a task entrusted by God, an arrow to be driven into the immortal for humanity.</t5821> <t5822>The task is there, can we retreat?</t5822> <t5823>As for me, I do not mind anything.</t5823> <t5824>Anyway, I am already old, life, the radiant sunlight, houses, gardens with chirping birds, music, love, longing... all, all are receding behind.</t5824> <t5825>But you, you are still very young. Some of you, although you have endured many sad things, happy days will still open their arms to welcome you.</t5825> <t5826>What do you decide?</t5826>
<t5827>From the beginning until now, Jonathan has been attentively listening.</t5827> <t5828>To be honest, when I saw him grasp my hand tightly, I suddenly became worried that the danger the professor was talking about would severely affect his nerves, causing him to completely lose heart. But then I felt as if I had been revived when I sensed the message through his hand, a hand that was tight, firm, and full of determination.</t5828> <t5829>Clearly, the hand of a brave man has its own voice, and only a woman with a burning love in her heart can perceive that voice.</t5829>
<t5830>The professor silently waited, Jonathan and I exchanged glances, any words between us at this moment were useless.</t5830>
<t5831>— Mina and I would like to say yes.</t5831> <t5832>- Jonathan replied.</t5832>
<t5833>"Please trust me, Professor," Morris asserted his inner desire.</t5833>
<t5834>— I also wish to accompany you to the end, - Lord Godalming expressed his feelings - I want to fulfill my duty in memory of Lucy, and even if there is no other purpose, just to lend you a hand.</t5834>
<t5835>As for himself, Dr. Seward just nodded silently.</t5835> <t5836>To him, that was more than enough to convey what was burning in his heart.</t5836> <t5837>All of us extended our hands to clearly show our determination.</t5837> <t5838>Thus, our grand wish was agreed upon.</t5838> <t5839>To be honest, there were moments when my heart seemed to tighten, although there was never a moment when I thought I had to refuse to participate in the dangerous task ahead.</t5839> <t5840>After the handshakes that demonstrated our resolve, we returned to our seats.</t5840> <t5841>Van Helsing continued his explanations with the enthusiasm of someone who felt very comfortable inside, understanding that our most important mission had finally begun with the highest level of unity and cooperation.</t5841>
<t5842>— Very good! Now we know what we are fighting against.</t5842><t5843>We are not lacking in forces.</t5843><t5844>We have the advantage in numbers, because “vampires” are always solitary, while we are many.</t5844><t5845>We have information from books.</t5845><t5846>Moreover, we are free to act and free to think.</t5846><t5847>In terms of action, we also have the advantage, as both day and night belong to us.</t5847><t5848>In fact, with the advantages we have, we can act freely as we wish.</t5848><t5849>We are dedicated to a single purpose, and the purpose we aim for benefits not just one person, but all of humanity.</t5849><t5850>Now, let's consider the limitations of “vampires” in general and of the count in particular.</t5850><t5851>To do this, we need to refer to tradition and belief.</t5851><t5852>But in reality, tradition and belief do not bring anything significant when it comes to life and death... or more specifically, the issues at hand are far more important than life and death.</t5852><t5853>However, we need to be content with ourselves, first because we are forced to act, and second because tradition and belief do not leave anything too important.</t5853><t5854>Let me ask, about a year ago, in this nineteenth century with its peak of scientific development, who among us dared to admit what we have just learned now?</t5854><t5855>We once loathed a belief, only to soon witness a reality that was not at all irrational.</t5855><t5856>Believe that the “vampire” - a character that makes many people believe in its existence and its powers as well as its limitations - has also provided evidence of its existence in the eyes of many outside of us.</t5856><t5857>We can see this wherever there are people on this earth.</t5857><t5858>“Vampires” are mentioned everywhere: ancient Greece, ancient Rome, Germany, France, India, even the Chersonese islands.</t5858><t5859>In China, a country very far from us, even today many people are so terrified just by hearing about it that they quickly hide under their blankets.</t5859><t5860>Its bad reputation quietly follows the footsteps of the Irish, Hungarians, Slavs, Saxons, and nomadic Magyars across all continents.</t5860><t5861>So we know everything we need to know, and we have all the necessary data to take action.</t5861><t5862>But I must also say that there are still many beliefs about this character that have not been verified during the time we experienced the recent misfortune.</t5862><t5863>“Vampires” live without fearing that time will gradually bring them closer to death.</t5863><t5864>They will continue to expand as long as they are nourished by the blood of the living.</t5864><t5865>We can see them become younger, stronger, and able to revive immediately if they find their preferred source of nourishment.</t5865><t5866>They must follow this lifestyle and cannot live like ordinary people.</t5866><t5867>As our friend Jonathan saw, during the many weeks at Dracula's castle, did he ever see it eat a meal?</t5867><t5868>Never! Another equally strange thing: it has no shadow; its form is not reflected in mirrors, as Jonathan has also seen.</t5868><t5869>Moreover, it has tremendous strength, as Jonathan described in his diary when it closed the castle gate to keep the wolves out and when it helped him down from the carriage.</t5869><t5870>It can transform into a wolf, as seen when a certain ship docked at Whitby or when it attacked and tore apart a house dog, or into a bat as Mina saw on the window ledge at Whitby, as John saw when it flew from the neighboring house, or as Quincey saw when it perched on Lucy's window.</t5870><t5871>It can approach the brave captain sitting at the helm by creating a thick fog around itself, but we can easily determine its limited space by that very fog.</t5871><t5872>“Vampires” can appear as dust particles mingling with moonlight, as in the case of the three women Jonathan saw several times in Dracula's castle. You know, it can shrink itself to fit through a hair-thin crack in the Westenra family tomb.</t5872><t5873>Once it finds its way, it can enter any place and see through the darkness, which is not a power to be underestimated in a twilight world.</t5873><t5874>It can do all the things I just mentioned, but that does not mean it has free choice.</t5874><t5875>It is truly a prisoner of itself, a prisoner sentenced to lifelong hard labor, a madman locked in a confined room.</t5875><t5876>Going to all the places it wants is impossible for it.</t5876><t5877>It is not a natural living entity but one that must live according to certain specific rules of its own.</t5877><t5878>Not every door is open to it.</t5878><t5879>Like other evil forces, its powers cease as soon as the first rays of dawn appear.</t5879><t5880>It has the right to freedom, but only at specific times.</t5880><t5881>If it is not at the place it wants to be, it cannot return there before sunset.</t5881><t5882>We know this from folklore and documentary books, and we can also find similar evidence from what we have gathered here.</t5882><t5883>Thus, although it can often show off its power as it pleases, “vampires” cannot ignore the limitations imposed within a specific range: coffins, hell, or an unblessed grave of a suicide in the Whitby cemetery, for instance, and it can only move at very specific times, or cross the ocean during high tide.</t5883><t5884>And as we know, there are certain things that can nullify its powers, like me, or a symbolic object like a golden cross: seeing this sacred object, it must retreat and find a way to escape.</t5884><t5885>There are other things you should know in case of necessity, such as wild rose placed on the coffin lid to prevent it from escaping, a holy bullet shot into the coffin will kill it, I mean a true death.</t5885><t5886>And when a stake is driven into its heart, just like beheading it, we will give it eternal sleep, never to wake up again.</t5886><t5887>We all understand this case, right?</t5887>
<t5888>— Thus, - Professor Van Helsing continued - for Count Dracula, when we find his dwelling, we will do everything to keep him in his lair to destroy him right there.</t5888> <t5889>But don't forget that he is extremely cunning and also very intelligent.</t5889> <t5890>I once asked my friend Arminius at the University of Budapest to provide information about Dracula's life, and he told me everything he knew about this monstrous character.</t5890> <t5891>It is possible that he is the infamous leader Dracula who went down in history for crossing the river to fight the Turks right at the border with Turkey.</t5891> <t5892>If that is indeed the case, then he is not an ordinary person, because in that century of war, and even in many centuries thereafter, people spoke a lot about him as the most talented, boldest, and bravest son of the "land beyond the forest".</t5892> <t5893>His extraordinary intelligence and unshakable willpower went with him to the grave, and now, he is using them against us.</t5893> <t5894>According to Arminius, the Dracula family belonged to a famous noble lineage, some members of which in subsequent generations had dubious relations with the devil.</t5894> <t5895>They began to establish schools and preach their occult magic at Scholomance, a place in the mountains by Lake Hermannstadt, where the devil trained one out of ten disciples to become like him.</t5895> <t5896>There are many documents that refer to this being with names like stregoica: meaning witch; ordog: Satan; pokol: hell.</t5896> <t5897>And one of those documents mentioned our Count Dracula as a vampir - that is, "vampire", whose characteristics are exactly what we have come to understand so well.</t5897> <t5898>Dracula is the seed that created numerous other notorious male and female figures who, even in their graves, always considered this earth as the only possible dwelling place for evil...</t5898>
<t5899>Although I was listening attentively, I still didn't understand why Morris kept looking out the window all this time.</t5899> <t5900>Finally, he quietly stood up and left the room without a word of explanation. Van Helsing was silent for a moment, then continued the story:</t5900>
<t5901>— Now let's decide what needs to be done.</t5901> <t5902>Based on the data I just mentioned, we need to come up with a solution for our plan.</t5902> <t5903>According to Jonathan's investigation, fifty crates of earth were transported from Dracula's castle to Whitby, and all were stored in the abandoned house at Carfax, but we also know that some crates were later taken away.</t5903> <t5904>In my opinion, perhaps first, we should determine whether there are any crates left in that house, or if they have all been taken away.</t5904> <t5905>In that case, we will have to find...</t5905>
<t5906>While speaking, he suddenly fell silent midway, causing everyone to be surprised.</t5906> <t5907>We were even more astonished when we suddenly heard a loud gunshot that made everyone jump: a bullet from an unknown source shattered the window glass, ricocheted off the window frame, and embedded itself in the far wall of the room.</t5907> <t5908>Surely, I am a coward, because just that made me shrink in fear, scream loudly like a madwoman.</t5908> <t5909>The men jumped up in panic.</t5909> <t5910>Lord Godalming hurried to the window to look outside.</t5910> <t5911>We clearly heard Morris's voice:</t5911>
<t5912>— A thousand apologies, everyone!</t5912> <t5913>Perhaps I have startled you all?</t5913> <t5914>I will tell you right away what just happened!</t5914>
<t5915>Later, we saw Morris hurrying back.</t5915>
<t5916>— I am so stupid! - He said, panting - Mrs. Harker, I sincerely apologize to you! Perhaps I have frightened you too much.</t5916> <t5917>But the thing is this: while the professor was engrossed in conversation, a very large bat suddenly swooped in and perched on the window ledge.</t5917> <t5918>After so many things had happened, I suddenly felt terrified of this filthy creature, to the point that I cannot help but shoot whenever I see them.</t5918> <t5919>I don't know how long this feeling has been within me.</t5919> <t5920>You won't mock me, will you, Arthur?</t5920>
<t5921>— Did you hit the target? - Van Helsing asked.</t5921>
<t5922>— I'm afraid not, as it continues to fly towards the forest.</t5922>
<t5923>Morris returned to his seat and said nothing more.</t5923> <t5924>Professor Van Helsing continued with what he was about to say:</t5924>
<t5925>— We will have to search each crate one by one, and when we determine where they are being sent, we will either seize them, or we will kill Dracula in one of his lairs.</t5925> <t5926>It could also be like this: we will neutralize the effect of the soil contained in the wooden crates, so he will no longer have a safe hiding place.</t5926> <t5927>We will confront him while he is still in human form from noon until sunset, meaning we will fight him when he is at his weakest...</t5927> <t5928>As for you, Harker, you will not need to worry about anything from now until everything is over.</t5928> <t5929>To us, you are very precious, so you cannot expose yourself to the countless dangers that lie ahead.</t5929> <t5930>Tonight, you do not need to ask us any more questions.</t5930> <t5931>We promise to tell you everything at an appropriate time.</t5931> <t5932>We men can endure the harshest trials, but you, our lucky star and hope, must always be kept safe from all dangers.</t5932>
<t5933>So, everyone, including Jonathan, breathed a sigh of relief as if they had just shed a concern that no one had been comfortable enough to voice.</t5933> <t5934>However, I did not want them to exclude me from this adventure, because I thought that if we had more people, even just one more person like me, we would be stronger than without me.</t5934> <t5935>But in the face of their determination, I could only silently accept being left out as a guarantee of my own safety.</t5935>
<t5936>Having been silent until now, Morris suddenly spoke up to join the conversation:</t5936>
<t5937>— Perhaps we don't have much time left, I suggest we should look into what happened in the abandoned house.</t5937> <t5938>Once we talk about that blood-sucking demon, every minute that passes is very precious to us: acting quickly and promptly, who knows, we might prevent him from causing harm to a new victim.</t5938>
<t5939>To be honest, I felt completely drained when I realized that the men were about to get to work immediately, but I wasn't foolish enough to voice my fears, because if I did, I would hinder their determination and from then on, they would never let me participate in any discussions again.</t5939> <t5940>Now, they have gone to the abandoned Carfax house with everything they might need to break in.</t5940>
<t5941>Men are truly different!</t5941> <t5942>They told me to go to sleep immediately and not to think about anything at all.</t5942> <t5943>They act as if a woman can just fall asleep when the people she loves are facing danger!</t5943>
<t5944>Alright, I will go lie down and pretend to sleep so that when he returns, Jonathan won't have anything to worry about or be concerned with regarding me.</t5944>
<t5945>Dr. Seward's Diary</t5945>
<t5946>• October 1, 4 AM</t5946>
<t5947>As soon as we poked our heads out the door, we ran into the warden coming towards us. He asked—again about Renfield—if I could go see him right now because he said he had something very important to tell me.</t5947> <t5948>I replied that I was very busy tonight and would meet him early tomorrow.</t5948>
<t5949>— But this time he seems more impatient than ever, sir.</t5949> <t5950>- The warden pleaded. - Although I really wish it weren't so, I still have the feeling that if you don't go see him immediately, he's going to have the most violent outburst we've ever seen.</t5950>
<t5951>Believing him, I told my friends to wait a few minutes while I went to meet him.</t5951>
<t5952>— I want to go with you, John. - Van Helsing said.</t5952> <t5953>- Your diary shows me that this patient is quite interesting, sometimes he is also related to our case.</t5953> <t5954>I really want to visit this guy when he is about to have an episode.</t5954>
<t5955>— May I come along? - Lord Godalming asked.</t5955>
<t5956>— What about me? - It's Quincey Morris's turn.</t5956>
<t5957>— Me too? - Finally, it was Jonathan Harker.</t5957>
<t5958>I nodded and said that everyone could go together.</t5958>
<t5959>Indeed, Renfield was very agitated, but I had never seen him so clear-headed and calm in his manner of speaking to me.</t5959> <t5960>This time, I had the opportunity to witness another manifestation in his case, one that I had never encountered in any other patient before.</t5960> <t5961>He believed that the reasons he presented could not be opposed by us.</t5961> <t5962>What made him urgently want to see me was to ask for permission to be discharged and go home.</t5962> <t5963>He claimed that he was now completely recovered and no longer had the slightest mental disorder.</t5963> <t5964>"I will talk to your friends," he said, "who knows, they might have a good assessment of my current state.</t5964> <t5965>By the way, you haven't introduced me to them yet...”</t5965> <t5966>I was so stunned that I forgot that introducing others to an inmate in my asylum was not a very usual thing to do, but honestly, at this moment, Renfield had something about him that deserved to be treated with the social courtesies of everyday life.</t5966> <t5967>So I had no hesitation in introducing those present to each other: "Mr. Renfield... Lord Godalming, Professor Van Helsing, Mr. Quincey Morris from Texas, USA, Mr. Jonathan Harker."</t5967>
<t5968>He shook hands and talked with each person.</t5968>
<t5969>— Lord Godalming, in Windham, I had the honor of assisting your father, and I am deeply sorry that he is no longer with us, now you bear his title.</t5969><t5970>He was always respected and loved by everyone who knew him.</t5970><t5971>I heard that in his youth, he invented a type of punch that was very popular among connoisseurs in Derby.</t5971><t5972>Mr. Morris, you have many reasons to be proud of your great state.</t5972><t5973>The annexation of Texas into the Union set a precedent, resulting in significant outcomes, as other states also wish to join under the Star-Spangled Banner.</t5973><t5974>One can easily recognize the strength of the Union Treaty when the Monroe Doctrine gains a real foothold as a political agreement.</t5974><t5975>How can I express my honor in meeting Professor Van Helsing? It is truly remiss of me not to have inquired about you with the usual courtesies.</t5975><t5976>When someone revolutionizes diagnostic methods through discoveries about the continuous development of the human brain, all ordinary forms of politeness are altered, for if such courtesies were applied to oneself, it might seem as though one wishes to diminish the positions of others.</t5976><t5977>All of you here, either by nationality, inheritance, or by nature's own favor, hold a place in our wildly spinning world.</t5977><t5978>Let me give an example: I am as physically and mentally sound as the vast majority of those who are entirely free out there.</t5978><t5979>Dr. Seward, I absolutely believe that as a very kind scholar, who has studied law as well as practiced medicine, you will understand that thoroughly re-examining my case is a moral duty of yours.</t5979>
<t5980>Speaking the last sentences, he tried to put on an act, showing himself to be very confident and no less polite towards me.</t5980>
<t5981>I think that even though my friends have never had a chance to interact with Renfield like I have, they are also very surprised.</t5981> <t5982>As for myself, despite knowing about the stages of his illness, I still believe that he is clearly trying to justify his intentions.</t5982> <t5983>Honestly, I just want to tell him that his condition has indeed made good progress and I will complete all the procedures so that he can be discharged tomorrow morning.</t5983> <t5984>But recalling his sudden and erratic changes, I want to do the opposite, I want to advise him to think carefully before making such an important decision.</t5984> <t5985>Therefore, I have to tell him that his condition is improving day by day, and I will talk to him more tomorrow morning, after which I will make a specific decision regarding his request.</t5985>
<t5986>He seemed dissatisfied with my answer, as I saw him retort immediately:</t5986>
<t5987>— But doctor, I'm afraid you still don't understand me.</t5987> <t5988>What I want is to go home immediately, right now... right this moment, as I'm speaking, if possible.</t5988> <t5989>Time is very urgent, and time is the most crucial factor in our implicit agreement with Death.</t5989> <t5990>I think it would be best if you go ahead and do what you just mentioned.</t5990>
<t5991>He stared at me intently as if waiting, seeing that I showed no sign of agreement, he turned to plead with someone else.</t5991> <t5992>Not receiving any answer, even just a nod, he pressed on:</t5992>
<t5993>— Could I have been mistaken with my assumptions?</t5993>
<t5994>— That's right, you were wrong, and very wrong at that.</t5994> <t5995>- I replied bluntly.</t5995>
<t5996>He remained silent for a long time, then leisurely continued:</t5996>
<t5997>— If that's the case, then perhaps I must make another request of you.</t5997> <t5998>This time, I would like to ask everyone to make a concession for me, to grant me a favor or a priority, as you would put it.</t5998> <t5999>This time, I beg you not for my own personal motives, but for the happiness of others.</t5999> <t6000>I don't have much time to explain to you all the reasons that compel me to implore you, but please believe that they are valid, undeniable reasons, and completely devoid of any personal gain.</t6000> <t6001>I am inspired by the noble meaning of the duty that I feel I must fulfill.</t6001> <t6002>Doctor, if you could read the thoughts from the bottom of my heart, you would surely fully support the sentiments driving me.</t6002> <t6003>And you might even consider me one of your closest and most loyal friends.</t6003>
<t6004>Finishing his words, he once again cast a scrutinizing glance at all of us.</t6004> <t6005>At this moment, I began to suspect that his sudden change in behavior was merely another form, or more precisely, another phase of his madness.</t6005> <t6006>And I told myself that I needed to wait and see what would happen, because with the many years of experience I had accumulated with madmen, I understood that his illness was about to relapse.</t6006> <t6007>I didn't understand what Van Helsing was thinking, because from earlier until now he had been frowning while observing him from head to toe. Suddenly, he asked him in a tone that, at first, I found unremarkable, but later, upon reflection, I sensed something peculiar.</t6007> <t6008>Clearly, he was regarding him as a completely sane person rather than a mental patient:</t6008>
<t6009>— Can you not explain to us why you want to leave here tonight?</t6009> <t6010>I am sure that you are not hiding anything from me.</t6010> <t6011>I say that I, a foreigner who always tries to understand everything and has no prejudice against you: then surely Dr. Seward will be responsible for letting you out of the hospital.</t6011>
<t6012>He shook his head sadly.</t6012> <t6013>Seeing his expression, I knew he was regretting something.</t6013> <t6014>The professor, not showing any concern for his despondency, continued speaking:</t6014>
<t6015>— So, my friend? Just think it over carefully.</t6015> <t6016>You say that you have recovered, you want to prove to us that your mind has returned to normal, but we still have doubts because you haven't done anything to prove it. If you don't help us in this test, how can Dr. Seward agree with you?</t6016> <t6017>Once again, I advise you to think very carefully, help us, trust me, my friend, I truly wish for you to be free</t6017><t6018>!</t6018>
<t6019>— Doctor Van Helsing, - He shook his head and replied - I can't say anything.</t6019> <t6020>Your argument is indeed irrefutable, if it were just for me, I certainly wouldn't hesitate to tell you, but because I am not the only one involved in this matter.</t6020> <t6021>I can only ask you to trust me.</t6021> <t6022>If you don't let me leave here, then please inform Doctor Seward that I will not take any responsibility for what might happen.</t6022>
<t6023>Seeing that it was time to end the pointless conversation, I stepped outside the door and called back:</t6023>
<t6024>— Come on, everyone, let's get to work.</t6024> <t6025>Goodbye, Renfield!</t6025>
<t6026>However, just as I was about to open the door, the patient's demeanor suddenly changed.</t6026> <t6027>He rushed towards me, causing me to cry out in alarm, thinking he intended to kill me again. But I was mistaken; he merely extended both hands, urgently repeating his request to me.</t6027> <t6028>Although it seemed he understood that such pleading was a bit excessive, he became increasingly desperate and earnest.</t6028> <t6029>Yet, I still firmly refused his request, pushing him back and telling him not to waste his time.</t6029> <t6030>This wasn't the first time I had seen him humble himself to the utmost when he wanted to immediately obtain a favor he deemed crucial, such as the day he begged me to bring him a cat.</t6030> <t6031>Just like that day, I thought he would eventually accept my refusal, despite his seemingly indifferent attitude.</t6031> <t6032>But this time, he did not.</t6032>
<t6033>Seeing that his requests to me were in vain, he began to go mad.</t6033> <t6034>He knelt down on the ground, raised his hands before me, and bowed repeatedly, hoping to appeal to my compassion.</t6034> <t6035>Tears streaming down his face, his expression utterly miserable, he continued his lengthy speech to me.</t6035>
<t6036>— Please, Dr. Seward, I beg you!</t6036> <t6037>Allow me to leave this house right now! I don't care about the manner of the send-off! You can have guards with whips and chains follow me; they can put me in a straitjacket, handcuff me, shackle my feet, collar my neck...</t6037> <t6038>But for the love of God, let me out of here!</t6038> <t6039>If you force me to stay in this asylum, you will be deliberately ignoring a cruelty, and for what reason?</t6039> <t6040>Please believe that my words come from the depths of my heart! Have mercy on this wretched soul!</t6040> <t6041>For everything that is sacred and dear to you in this world, for the love you have lost, for the hope that still lingers in your heart, and for the Almighty God, let me out of here and save my sinful soul! Are you listening to me, Doctor?</t6041> <t6042>Do you understand what I'm saying?</t6042> <t6043>Can you not see my physical and mental recovery?</t6043> <t6044>Do you think I'm not speaking seriously?</t6044> <t6045>I am not a madman in a fit of insanity, but a rational person; who will save my soul?</t6045> <t6046>Let me go! Let me go!</t6046>
<t6047>I think that the longer this scene drags on, the more likely he is to become agitated, and if so, he might actually go crazy.</t6047>
<t6048>— Come on, stop it! - I said seriously. - That's enough!</t6048> <t6049>Go lie down on the bed to calm yourself down?</t6049>
<t6050>He helplessly stared at me.</t6050> <t6051>Then, without a word, he sullenly stood up and went to sit on the bed.</t6051>
<t6052>Waiting for my friends to go out first, I stood and looked at him once more before leaving.</t6052> <t6053>Before he was out of sight, I heard him say something after me, his voice very calm and no less polite:</t6053>
<t6054>— Dr. Seward, I hope you will never forget that tonight I did everything I could to persuade you!</t6054>
<t6055>CHAPTER 19</t6055>
<t6056>Jonathan Harker's Diary</t6056>
<t6057>• October 1, 5 AM</t6057>
<t6058>I, along with everyone else, went to Carfax House in a very relaxed state of mind, as I had never seen Mina so healthy and confident.</t6058> <t6059>If she were to directly participate in our work, she would likely find it hard to avoid nightmares, but fortunately, she now agrees to let us act on our own, so I am somewhat relieved.</t6059> <t6060>Moreover, I hope she is thinking that she has already done what needed to be done: all the smallest details have been gathered, and if they are useful to us, isn't it thanks to her effort and intelligence?</t6060>
<t6061>I believe that all of us were haunted after visiting Renfield. From the moment we left his room, none of us spoke a word to each other.</t6061> <t6062>It was only when we returned to Seward's office that I heard Morris speak:</t6062>
<t6063>— John, if Renfield isn't a fraud, then he is the most rational madman I have ever seen!</t6063> <t6064>I don't dare to make hasty judgments, but it seems like he is seriously contemplating something, so you should keep an eye on him!</t6064>
<t6065>I and Lord Godalming did not notice anything remarkable, but Dr. Van Helsing was different; he said:</t6065>
<t6066>— My friend John, I am truly delighted to see that you understand the stages of mental illness in patients better than I do, because if it were up to me to make the decision, I might have released Renfield right before he became so agitated.</t6066> <t6067>But up until now, the more we understand what concerns us, as our friend Quincey has said, we cannot afford to act recklessly when the task we are undertaking is extremely dangerous.</t6067> <t6068>Everything is unfolding in the sequence it is meant to.</t6068>
<t6069>It seems that Dr. Seward intended to answer both people at the same time:</t6069>
<t6070>— That's exactly right.</t6070> <t6071>If he were like many other patients, I wouldn't hesitate to show him that I trust him very much.</t6071> <t6072>But in this case, his behavior seems to depend a lot on the movements of the old count.</t6072> <t6073>If I let him go without paying attention to his erratic temperament, I would be making an unforgivable mistake.</t6073> <t6074>Once, standing in front of me, he kept babbling, calling the old count “My Lord” and “His Master.”</t6074> <t6075>I suspect he might be preparing to help Dracula carry out some demonic mission, this demon who can command wolves and filthy rats, not to mention other entities just like him: so how could he not think of making a madman obey him? Yes, it seems that Renfield was speaking very seriously, I realized that even though I also know very well about his illness.</t6075> <t6076>I hope we are doing the right thing.</t6076> <t6077>But this is happening just as we are conducting our mournful searches, so I fear it will dampen everyone's spirits.</t6077>
<t6078>The professor smiled, walked over, patted Seward on the shoulder, and reassured him:</t6078>
<t6079>— My dear friend, don't worry at all! Indeed, we are striving to undertake a truly dreadful mission, and we can only act with the reason we find most correct, but we should also hope for the mercy of God!</t6079>
<t6080>I don't understand what Lord Godalming went outside to do a few minutes ago; I only saw that when he returned, he was juggling a silver whistle in his hand.</t6080>
<t6081>— Maybe that house will be teeming with rats.</t6081> <t6082>- He held the whistle in front of us and explained.</t6082> <t6083>- I have this to drive those filthy creatures away.</t6083>
<t6084>We quietly walked towards the abandoned house, hiding under the tree canopies to avoid the risk of being exposed by the moonlight that could suddenly break through the clouds at any moment.</t6084> <t6085>In front of the house, Van Helsing opened his bag and took out dozens of small items, placing them on the doorstep in four small piles, clearly indicating that each pile would be distributed to each of us.</t6085>
<t6086>— Friends, - He explained - we are facing an extremely dangerous challenge, therefore, we need all kinds of weapons. The threat from the enemy is not just the ability to command spirits.</t6086> <t6087>Remember that he alone is more than enough to fight against twenty people combined.</t6087> <t6088>With his immense power, it would be difficult for us to even injure him, let alone...</t6088> <t6089>Moreover, if injured, he would go mad and make our situation a thousand times worse.</t6089> <t6090>Therefore, it's better to be a bit cautious.</t6090> <t6091>Wear this on your chest - he handed me a small cross, as I was the one standing closest to him - and this garland too - he handed me a garland of dried garlic to wear around my neck. - Take this handgun and knife as well, we still don't know if there are any other enemies.</t6091> <t6092>Each person take a lamp and put it in your jacket, and remember this: none of us are allowed to wander around the house, understood?</t6092>
<t6093>He took a piece of holy bread, put it into a small paper bag, and handed it to me.</t6093> <t6094>The others also received the same "weapon" as I did:</t6094>
<t6095>— By the way, John, where are the keychains? - The professor asked Dr. Seward.</t6095>
<t6096>— If we can open the main door, we won't have to climb through the window like thieves.</t6096> <t6097>We did the same thing at Lucy's house the other day.</t6097>
<t6098>After fumbling for a while, Seward finally chose a hook that fit the house's lock.</t6098> <t6099>For him, that was enough to unlock the door.</t6099> <t6100>The heavy door creaked loudly as it was pushed open.</t6100> <t6101>The sound immediately reminded me of the image of Dr. Seward and the others entering the Westenra family tomb, as he had recounted in his diary.</t6101> <t6102>It seemed that the others were having similar thoughts, as they all suddenly stood still at the same time. Professor Van Helsing was the one who decided to step in first.</t6102>
<t6103>— In manus tuas, Domine! - He mumbled something as he stepped over the threshold.</t6103>
<t6104>We carefully closed the door.</t6104> <t6105>At this moment, each person was only paying attention to the light shining from their own hand.</t6105> <t6106>The professor carefully checked the door latch in case we needed to make an emergency retreat.</t6106> <t6107>The investigation of the abandoned house began.</t6107>
<t6108>In the sickly yellow beam from the small flashlight, I saw that every object here took on a bizarre shape.</t6108> <t6109>Moreover, the light from one person's flashlight occasionally flashed across another, making our own shadows become very frightening.</t6109> <t6110>I couldn't shake the feeling that we weren't the only ones present in this dark house.</t6110> <t6111>Perhaps the terrifying memories of Transylvania had suddenly returned to me in the cold, dark night here.</t6111> <t6112>However, I believe that it wasn't just me; all my friends shared the same sense of apprehension, because every time we heard a small noise or suddenly noticed a shadow cast long on the wall, everyone would startle and turn to look.</t6112>
<t6113>In the house, everywhere is full of dust.</t6113> <t6114>I have the feeling that on the floor, except for the places with fresh footprints, the dust is thick enough to reach a finger joint.</t6114> <t6115>The walls are the same, dust clings in patches like a layer of filthy fur; in the corners, dust forms patches on the cobwebs hanging suspended, making me think that above my head are pieces of torn burlap. On a table in the hallway, there is a large bunch of keys, each with a plastic tag indicating the room number, yellowed by time.</t6115> <t6116>It seems that these keys have been used quite a few times, as I see small streaks on the dusty surface of the table, very similar to the grooves left when the professor just lifted the bunch of keys.</t6116>
<t6117>The professor held the bunch of keys and turned to me, saying:</t6117>
<t6118>— Jonathan, you are the one who knows this house better than anyone else. You have the blueprints of the house, or at least copies of them, and you have surely spent a lot of time studying them. So, do you still remember where the altar of this house is located?</t6118>
<t6119>Of course, I know very well where the church is located, even though on my first visit to this house, I didn't have the chance to go inside.</t6119> <t6120>I led everyone through a few winding corridors, arriving at an oak door with an arch above it.</t6120>
<t6121>— This is it! - The professor said as he shone the light to inspect the copy of the map that I had used when purchasing the house.</t6121>
<t6122>He had to try a bunch of keys before he found one that fit the lock.</t6122> <t6123>We were waiting for something very unpleasant to happen.</t6123> <t6124>Indeed, as soon as the door was slightly ajar, a strong stench immediately wafted out, making us instantly imagine the disgusting air we would have to breathe when stepping inside.</t6124>
<t6125>Except for me, no one in the group has seen the old count yet.</t6125><t6126>As for myself, when I saw him, he was either lurking somewhere in his dusty rooms or fully engorged with blood in an almost outdoor dilapidated house.</t6126><t6127>But the place where we are standing now is completely cramped and sealed off, with a stifling atmosphere that seems to have been there for ages.</t6127><t6128>I could smell the earth, and increasingly felt a pervasive stench filling the air.</t6128><t6129>I really don't know how to describe the true nature of that foul odor.</t6129><t6130>Not only were all the evils that cause death in the world gathered there, but it seemed as if decay itself was transforming to create this hell.</t6130><t6131>Just thinking about it is enough to make me sick!</t6131><t6132>Every breath of the devil seemed to be attached to each stone of the four walls of the shrine!</t6132>
<t6133>Perhaps in other situations, just thinking like that would have made us give up already.</t6133> <t6134>But before us was an important and significant goal, to the extent that we had to overcome the most disgusting obstacles.</t6134> <t6135>After standing still and reflexively jumping back, we suddenly remembered our task and had to view this place as a rose garden.</t6135>
<t6136>— First of all, - the Professor said - we need to see how many wooden crates are left.</t6136> <t6137>We must check every corner, nook, and cranny, and any trace that might help us discover something!</t6137>
<t6138>We had no trouble counting the wooden crates, as they were actually all quite large wooden boxes.</t6138> <t6139>There could be no mistake! The total number according to the documents was fifty crates, but here there were only twenty-nine! While counting, I was startled and frightened when Lord Godalming suddenly turned to check the slightly ajar door leading to a dark hallway.</t6139> <t6140>My heart felt like it was going to jump out of my chest.</t6140> <t6141>I had the feeling that the Count's piercing eyes were looking through the seemingly tangible darkness, and I imagined beneath those eyes was a hooked nose, red plump lips standing out on an always pale face...</t6141> <t6142>About a minute later, Lord Godalming returned, muttering: "I thought it was some damned person, but it turned out to be just some silly shadows."</t6142> <t6143>I carefully shone the light towards the door and into the hallway, but clearly, there was no one there.</t6143> <t6144>There were no corners, no hidden doors, nor any crevices, just walls thickly covered in dust.</t6144> <t6145>I had to check to make sure there was no place inside where someone could hide - not even him.</t6145> <t6146>Fear had turned me into a victim of my own imagination.</t6146> <t6147>However, who would be foolish enough to mention this?</t6147>
<t6148>A few minutes later, while glancing around to check a corner of the church, Morris suddenly jumped back in panic.</t6148> <t6149>We were startled and all eyes turned towards him.</t6149> <t6150>Cold sweat ran down my body as I caught a glimpse of flickering lights, like phosphorescent glows, darting past in front of me.</t6150> <t6151>We instinctively stepped back.</t6151> <t6152>In the blink of an eye, countless rats were scurrying chaotically in the abandoned church.</t6152>
<t6153>The scene before us truly terrified us.</t6153> <t6154>Only Lord Godalming remained calm as if he had anticipated the event.</t6154> <t6155>He quickly rushed to the oak door, unlatched it, flung it open, and blew a single note on a silver whistle.</t6155> <t6156>Hearing the whistle's wheezing sound like a sick cat, the dogs behind the asylum barked loudly, filling the area with noise.</t6156> <t6157>About a minute later, three hunting dogs immediately ran around the corner of the abandoned house.</t6157> <t6158>We instinctively stepped back.</t6158> <t6159>As we backed near the door, I noticed that the dust here had also been trampled by many footprints: surely the missing wooden crates had been moved through this way.</t6159> <t6160>But that was also when another swarm of rats suddenly rushed in to join the previous group, creating a chaotic and horrifying scene before our eyes.</t6160> <t6161>They swarmed all over the church with their chilling squeaks, each one with eyes glowing like fireflies on the ground.</t6161> <t6162>The aggressive dogs tried to leap in, but for some reason, as soon as they reached the threshold, they all suddenly halted, growling and howling like wolves.</t6162> <t6163>The swarm of rats, easily numbering in the thousands, continued their frenzied rampage inside the church.</t6163> <t6164>We frantically leaped out the door.</t6164>
<t6165>Lord Godalming grabbed a dog and threw it into the church. As soon as its feet touched the ground, the hunting dog immediately regained its inherent courage and began mercilessly slaughtering its arch-enemies.</t6165> <t6166>In the blink of an eye, it had killed more than twenty rats, but in that same amount of time, the rats had scattered, fleeing so quickly that they left no chance for the two other dogs that had just entered the church.</t6166>
<t6167>The sudden disappearance of the rats made us feel as if the devil had just retreated.</t6167> <t6168>The dogs were still bustling around the house, tails wagging as if they were very pleased with their recent victory.</t6168> <t6169>They seemed to take great pleasure in looking at the corpses of the unlucky rats on the floor.</t6169> <t6170>We felt as if we had just been infused with courage.</t6170> <t6171>It was unclear whether it was due to the appearance of the hunting dogs, the release of the stifling atmosphere in the room when the church doors were flung open, or the sigh of relief we felt when we realized we were no longer trapped, but in any case, the heavy threat weighing on us was somewhat lifted, much like shedding a filthy, uncomfortable garment.</t6171> <t6172>With the rats gone, we locked the church doors again, bolted them, chained them, and began to search the entire house.</t6172> <t6173>There was nothing special except for the dust, which covered all the remaining rooms thickly, and notably, there were no human footprints except for those I had left during my previous visit to handle the brokerage procedures.</t6173> <t6174>The dogs showed no particular signs, even when we returned to the church.</t6174> <t6175>They just ran around as if they were hunting hares on a beautiful day.</t6175>
<t6176>When we went out the gate of the house, it was also when a new day was about to begin.</t6176> <t6177>Van Helsing carefully locked the door and put the key in his pocket.</t6177> <t6178>I do not know when he removed this key from the key ring in the house.</t6178>
<t6179>— Good! - He said. - So our investigation tonight went smoothly!</t6179> <t6180>We now know how many wooden crates were transported.</t6180> <t6181>Moreover, we didn't have to face any danger as I had feared.</t6181> <t6182>But what makes me happiest is that we completed the first step of our work without Mina's involvement, so she won't be haunted by nightmares from the church earlier.</t6182> <t6183>Furthermore, this investigation also revealed something quite interesting to us, if not a definite conclusion about a completely different matter: the disgusting creatures under the Count's command do not always obey his pure psychic power.</t6183> <t6184>Just look at the rats, and you'll see they appear in droves at his command, just like when he summoned the wolves when you wanted to leave Dracula's castle, Jonathan, but then they immediately disappeared when they saw those little dogs! Indeed, we are only beginning to face a challenge.</t6184> <t6185>This is not the only time or the last time this demon will command the animal world with his power.</t6185> <t6186>He only temporarily disappeared before giving us a chance to cheer that "he has failed!" The game will be long.</t6186> <t6187>Now, let's go home.</t6187> <t6188>It's almost dawn.</t6188> <t6189>So today, we can be satisfied with our first night's work.</t6189>
<t6190>When I returned, I didn't see anything unusual in the asylum still immersed in Dr. Seward's sleep, except for the wailing of some unfortunate person in a room at the end of the hallway, or the groans from Renfield's room. His mind must be in great torment, as this is often seen in those with mental disorders.</t6190>
<t6191>I tiptoed back to the room.</t6191> <t6192>Mina was still deep in sleep, her breathing so slow and light that I had to lean in close to hear it.</t6192> <t6193>Only at this moment did I suddenly notice that she looked paler than usual.</t6193> <t6194>I hope yesterday's meeting didn't make her worry too much! Thankfully, she no longer participates in our investigations, searches, or decisions.</t6194> <t6195>She might get scared if she heard us discussing certain things.</t6195> <t6196>However, who knows if our keeping things from her might cause her even more distress if, at some point, she starts to suspect that we want her to stay silent about one thing or another.</t6196>
<t6197>It is possible that in the near future, we will strive to ensure that you have absolutely no doubts about our decisions and work - at least until we can inform you that the bloodthirsty demon has been permanently eradicated from this earth.</t6197> <t6198>For me, keeping silent is not an easy task, especially when the two of us have the habit of sharing everything with each other.</t6198> <t6199>But I have decided, when she wakes up, I will definitely not tell her anything about what happened during the night.</t6199> <t6200>If she insists on asking, I will just mumble to brush it off.</t6200> <t6201>The sky was about to fully brighten, I tiptoed to lie down on the couch to avoid disturbing her sleep.</t6201>
<t6202>• October 1, a little later</t6202>
<t6203>It's probably not unusual that we slept straight through until noon, because the whole day and night before, we hadn't had a moment to rest.</t6203> <t6204>Mina must have been very tired too, because I - the first one to wake up - had to shake her two or three times before she finally woke up.</t6204> <t6205>She slept so deeply that she didn't immediately realize there was someone in front of her.</t6205> <t6206>She looked at me bewildered and frightened, as if she had just gone through a terrible nightmare.</t6206> <t6207>Seeing her complain of fatigue, I told her to stay in bed for a few more minutes before getting up...</t6207> <t6208>Now, we know that twenty-one wooden crates have disappeared from the abandoned house.</t6208> <t6209>Therefore, I have to investigate where those missing crates have been taken.</t6209> <t6210>Today, I will go to Thomas Snelling's house.</t6210>
<t6211>Dr. Seward's Diary</t6211>
<t6212>• October 1</t6212>
<t6213>I woke up when it was almost noon.</t6213> <t6214>Van Helsing had been in my room for some time, but I didn't know when he arrived.</t6214> <t6215>He looked visibly cheerful, which was a rare sight for him.</t6215> <t6216>Perhaps what we had just discovered had put his mind at ease.</t6216> <t6217>He began the conversation by briefly recounting last night's investigation, then moved on to discuss the matter of patient Renfield:</t6217>
<t6218>— Your patient's hand caught my attention.</t6218> <t6219>Can I see him again today?</t6219> <t6220>If you're busy, you can just let me visit him alone.</t6220> <t6221>I find his case quite interesting.</t6221> <t6222>It's fascinating how a madman can speak so accurately about logic and philosophy!</t6222>
<t6223>Indeed, I am very busy today, so I had to ask you to go to Renfield's room alone because I didn't want you to waste time waiting.</t6223> <t6224>I called a warden and gave him some necessary instructions, and asked him to lead you there.</t6224> <t6225>But before you left the room, I still reminded you to be cautious.</t6225>
<t6226>— I was just going to talk about him - He replied - and the passion that drove him to swallow insects alive.</t6226> <t6227>Yesterday, I read your diary and found out that he had spoken to Mina.</t6227> <t6228>But what are you laughing at, John?</t6228>
<t6229>— I'm sorry, but the answer to your question lies here - I said, placing my hand on the stack of typed papers - When our rational and educated mad patient discussed the habit of eating living creatures with me, indeed his mouth was still smeared with spider legs and fly legs that he had just eaten right before Mrs. Harker entered the room.</t6229>
<t6230>Van Helsing chuckled.</t6230>
<t6231>— You have an excellent memory, my friend! I should have remembered this detail myself.</t6231> <t6232>However, it is precisely such flaws in thinking and memory that draw people to study mental patients.</t6232> <t6233>Who knows, by understanding the madness through Renfield's strange behavior, I might learn more about human wisdom!</t6233> <t6234>Who can say?</t6234>
<t6235>Speaking of which, I have to go to the office to start work.</t6235> <t6236>Time flies so fast; before I knew it, the professor had already returned.</t6236>
<t6237>— Am I bothering you?</t6237>
<t6238>— No, please go ahead! - I replied.</t6238> <t6239>- I have just finished some tasks, now I can take you if you still want.</t6239>
<t6240>— No need to go! I have already met him!</t6240>
<t6241>— Really?</t6241>
<t6242>— I'm just afraid he thinks nothing of me.</t6242> <t6243>The conversation was really brief.</t6243> <t6244>When I entered, he was squatting on a stool placed in the middle of the room, his hands supporting his chin, his face stubborn and unpleasant.</t6244> <t6245>I tried to talk to him with a cheerful attitude and great respect, but he still didn't bother to reply.</t6245> <t6246>“Don't you know me?” I asked.</t6246> <t6247>His response was clearly inappropriate: “Of course! It's that silly old Van Helsing, who else.</t6247> <t6248>I want you to find somewhere else to play.</t6248> <t6249>Go study your stupid brain! Damn you, you stupid Dutchman!” I couldn't say anything more, and he kept his stubborn, scowling face, completely forgetting my presence.</t6249> <t6250>So the chance to learn something more from this intelligent patient was gone.</t6250> <t6251>To comfort myself, perhaps I should go talk to the gentle Mina.</t6251> <t6252>John, how can I describe to you the joy I feel when we manage to shield her from the hardships and dangers that lie ahead? Granted, she can still help us with some things, but we must also act rightly.</t6252>
<t6253>— I completely agree with you.</t6253> <t6254>It is best not to let Mina worry any further.</t6254> <t6255>The situation is very dangerous for us now, men who have experienced many difficult times in the struggle for survival in life.</t6255> <t6256>If she continues to join us, this young woman will surely wither away.</t6256>
<t6257>So Van Helsing decided to visit and talk with the Harkers. At this time, Quincey and Arthur were continuing to search for the boxes of earth, or at least trace their whereabouts.</t6257> <t6258>Tonight, we will have another meeting together.</t6258>
<t6259>Mina Harker's Diary</t6259>
<t6260>• October 1</t6260>
<t6261>I feel very upset being left out like today.</t6261> <t6262>For so many years, Jonathan has always shown great trust in me, but today, I had to meet him without knowing anything about their conversation.</t6262> <t6263>This morning, I woke up very late because I was extremely tired all day yesterday.</t6263> <t6264>Jonathan also woke up not long before noon, but he was still the first to wake up!</t6264> <t6265>Before leaving, he spoke to me in a gentler and more affectionate tone than ever, but he didn't mention a single word about the investigation of the old count's house last night.</t6265> <t6266>However, he surely understands that I am very worried about this matter.</t6266> <t6267>Poor him! Keeping silent will only make him more troubled because of me.</t6267> <t6268>They all unanimously decided to leave me out, and I can only accept it.</t6268> <t6269>But just thinking about my husband harboring many secrets from me makes me feel upset!</t6269> <t6270>Yet, I burst into tears like a child when I think that it's because of his love for me that he has to keep silent.</t6270> <t6271>And the rest of them too, they are gallant and kind friends who only want to ensure my health and safety!</t6271>
<t6272>However, the hot tears rolling down my cheeks made me feel a bit relieved.</t6272> <t6273>I told myself that one day Jonathan would tell me everything.</t6273> <t6274>For now, I will continue to write my diary as usual.</t6274> <t6275>If he ever doubts my faith, I will let him know my feelings and thoughts through these diary entries.</t6275> <t6276>Just thinking about it, but today I still feel sad and weary.</t6276> <t6277>Perhaps this is also the consequence of my excessive emotions.</t6277>
<t6278>Last night, I went to bed right after Jonathan and his friends left the house, simply because they advised me to do so.</t6278> <t6279>I wasn't sleepy, just terribly worried.</t6279> <t6280>I suddenly thought about what had happened since the day Jonathan first visited me in London, everything seemed like a horrible play where the fates were cruelly moving towards their inevitable end.</t6280> <t6281>It seemed that any action we took, no matter how well-intentioned, resulted in terrible outcomes.</t6281> <t6282>If I hadn't gone to Whitby, Lucy might not have died.</t6282> <t6283>Before I arrived, she never went to the cemetery, did she? If she hadn't walked there with me, she wouldn't have sleepwalked there, and thus wouldn't have been harmed by that monster.</t6283> <t6284>Oh my God! Why on earth did I decide to go to Whitby? Yes... and so I cried again.</t6284> <t6285>I wondered what was wrong with me today.</t6285> <t6286>Jonathan surely doesn't know that I - who have never cried out of self-pity, and have never shed a tear in front of my husband - have cried twice today.</t6286> <t6287>If he realized this, he would certainly be extremely confused.</t6287> <t6288>Because normally, if I was upset about something, I would never show it on my face.</t6288>
<t6289>Yesterday, I don't know when I fell asleep.</t6289><t6290>I only remember suddenly hearing the loud barking of the house dogs and numerous strange murmurs coming from the room of the patient Renfield, which is the room directly below mine.</t6290><t6291>Then there was a deep silence that made me feel anxious.</t6291><t6292>A vague feeling of discomfort made me get up and look out the window.</t6292><t6293>The silence and darkness, occasionally punctuated by a bit of faint moonlight, made the late night even more mysterious.</t6293><t6294>There was nothing moving out there, everything was enveloped in a mournful and still atmosphere like in a dead world, except for a pale mist drifting very slowly, so slowly that I could barely perceive its movement across the grass towards its house; it seemed that only this mist was the embodiment of life at that moment.</t6294><t6295>The mist lingered in my mind, making me feel more at ease, for when I returned to bed, I felt myself starting to drift off as if I were falling asleep.</t6295><t6296>However, I still couldn't sleep; the mist was still floating in my thoughts, making me get up and look out the window once more.</t6296><t6297>By now, the mist had spread out and was hovering close to the house: I could see the dense mist clinging to the walls as if trying to climb through the windows.</t6297><t6298>At that moment, Renfield suddenly screamed like a mad dog; I couldn't understand what he was saying, but it was so pitiful.</t6298><t6299>Then I suddenly had the feeling that I heard someone fighting, perhaps the warden had entered the room and was being fiercely resisted by him, leading to a struggle.</t6299><t6300>Frightened, I went back to bed, pulled the blanket over my head, and tightly covered my ears.</t6300><t6301>At this point, I no longer felt sleepy.</t6301><t6302>But eventually, I gradually fell asleep, for after a dream, I couldn't remember what had happened until noon today, when Jonathan woke me up.</t6302><t6303>It took me a moment to gather my thoughts and realize where I was and who was standing in front of me.</t6303><t6304>In my deep sleep, I had a really bizarre dream, which showed how much I had been thinking and worrying.</t6304><t6305>Indeed, I had just gone through a deep, exhausting sleep!</t6305>
<t6306>...</t6306> <t6307>I fell into a deep sleep, dreaming that I was waiting for Jonathan to return.</t6307> <t6308>I was terribly worried about him, but I couldn't move to get up and follow my own will: my limbs, and even my head, suddenly felt numb under a very heavy weight pressing down on me.</t6308> <t6309>In the dream, I felt very uncomfortable and couldn't control my thoughts.</t6309> <t6310>At that moment, I had the sensation that the air around me had a heavy, damp, and chilling smell.</t6310> <t6311>I threw off the blanket and was astonished to find the room engulfed in darkness.</t6311> <t6312>The lamp I had dimmed while waiting for Jonathan was now just a small, reddish dot, emitting a light barely enough to see through an increasingly thick fog in the room.</t6312> <t6313>Even though I clearly remembered closing the window before going to sleep, I still wanted to check it again, but my limbs felt as if they were made of wood, unable to move.</t6313> <t6314>What could I do now? I had closed my eyes, but it seemed as though I could still see through my eyelids (dreams often have such peculiarities).</t6314> <t6315>The fog kept getting thicker, and now I realized how that eerie mist had entered the room: it didn't come through the window like smoke or steam, but through the gaps in the door.</t6315> <t6316>A moment later, the fog gradually transformed into a column of cloud - yes, if I could call it that - rising high to the ceiling, and at the top of the cloud, there seemed to be the light of a small, blood-red eye.</t6316> <t6317>Everything suddenly went topsy-turvy in my head.</t6317> <t6318>The denser the column of cloud became in the room, the more clearly I could read the words "Pillar of cloud by day, pillar of fire by night" through the fog, as written in the Bible.</t6318> <t6319>Could this be a warning I received in my sleep?</t6319> <t6320>The pillar of cloud was formed by two elements, day and night, because there was a fiery light in the red eye.</t6320> <t6321>The more I thought about it, the more I felt captivated by that image.</t6321> <t6322>A moment later, the red dot of fire suddenly split into two, like two eyes.</t6322> <t6323>That image reminded me of Lucy's words about the rays of the setting sun shining through the stained glass windows of St. Mary's Church when she and I sat on the cliff at Whitby.</t6323> <t6324>I was also shocked to recall Jonathan's experience of witnessing three monstrous creatures suddenly turning into dust under the moonlight and gradually transforming into three lascivious women.</t6324> <t6325>After that, I sank into a dark, murky sleep.</t6325>
<t6326>In a final effort of imagination, I saw a pale face emerge from the mist and lean down close to me.</t6326>
<t6327>Perhaps I should be wary of such dreams, because if they recur frequently, my mind will surely be seriously affected.</t6327> <t6328>I intend to ask Dr. Van Helsing or Dr. Seward why I am sleeping so heavily, but I am just afraid they will worry unnecessarily.</t6328> <t6329>If I tell them about my dream, they will surely be even more worried about me.</t6329> <t6330>Tonight, I will try to sleep as comfortably as possible.</t6330> <t6331>If I still can't sleep, maybe tomorrow night I will ask them for a sedative pill.</t6331> <t6332>I think using it just once won't do any harm, and I will have a really peaceful night.</t6332> <t6333>A dream like the one I just had can only make me tired if I continue to suffer from insomnia.</t6333>
<t6334>• October 2, 10 PM</t6334>
<t6335>Last night, I slept very deeply and did not have any dreams.</t6335> <t6336>However, the deep sleep still did not refresh me, and today I still feel quite tired and exhausted.</t6336> <t6337>All day yesterday, I tried to read but couldn't because of drowsiness.</t6337> <t6338>In the afternoon, Renfield asked to see me.</t6338> <t6339>The poor man was very kind when talking to me, and even when saying goodbye, he kissed my hand and prayed for God's blessing upon me.</t6339> <t6340>Suddenly, I felt such pity for him that I almost cried.</t6340> <t6341>Once again, I told myself to hide this weakness, because if Jonathan knew I cried, he would be immensely sad.</t6341>
<t6342>Jonathan and his friends only returned close to dinner time with very tired faces.</t6342><t6343>I did everything I could to help them feel less tired, and considered it a comfort that helped me gradually forget my own fatigue.</t6343><t6344>After dinner, they advised me to go to bed and rest, while they would go outside to smoke and relax, but I knew well that they wanted to go out and inform each other about the work each had done during the day.</t6344><t6345>Looking at Jonathan, I guessed that he had just discovered something very important.</t6345><t6346>Lying in bed, I felt that I couldn't sleep, so I asked Dr. Seward for a mild sedative. I explained to him that I hadn't slept well the previous night.</t6346><t6347>He gave me a pill that he said was very mild and had no side effects...</t6347><t6348>I took it and lay down waiting for sleep.</t6348><t6349>Not long after, I felt as if I was about to fall asleep...</t6349><t6350>But that was also when I was gripped by a fear: was I sure I hadn't made a mistake in taking that pill?</t6350><t6351>Perhaps it would be better if I stayed awake all night! But it was too late...</t6351><t6352>I was sinking into an unavoidable sleep...</t6352><t6353>Goodbye!</t6353>
<t6354>CHAPTER 20</t6354>
<t6355>Jonathan Harker's Diary</t6355>
<t6356>• October 1, evening</t6356>
<t6357>I met Thomas Snelling at home, but unfortunately, he is a very forgetful person.</t6357> <t6358>Even though I had informed him in advance, he still went out to drink beer until he was completely drunk, not caring whether I would come or not.</t6358>
<t6359>But in return, he had a very kind wife.</t6359> <t6360>After hearing my explanation, she advised me to go to Joseph Smollet's house to inquire.</t6360> <t6361>So I had to head up to Walworth Street again.</t6361> <t6362>I arrived when Smollet was sitting and having tea.</t6362> <t6363>He was a good-natured and intelligent worker, trustworthy enough for others to confide in about personal matters.</t6363> <t6364>He remembered very clearly the brawl that occurred when he came to pick up the goods at Carfax.</t6364> <t6365>After checking a tiny, frayed notebook, he immediately told me the address where the boxes of soil were received.</t6365> <t6366>He had transported a total of six boxes from Carfax to 179 Chicksand Street in Mile End New Town, and another six boxes to Jamaica Lane in Bermondsey.</t6366> <t6367>So if the plan was to distribute a few dirty boxes of soil in each location in London as a hideout, then Chicksand Street and Jamaica Lane were the first transit points that the Count used to later disperse them to other places.</t6367> <t6368>From this, it can be inferred that he was not just looking for a hideout in two areas of London. Therefore, I had to continue asking Smollet about the boxes of soil that had been transported away from Carfax.</t6368>
<t6369>— Yes, sir, - He replied - you have been quite generous to me (since I slipped him half a gold coin) so I will tell you everything I know!</t6369> <t6370>Four days ago, while drinking at the Hare and Hounds pub in the Pincher valley, I heard a guy named Bloxam say that he and another driver had entered an old house in Purfleet to work and ended up swallowing kilos of dust!</t6370> <t6371>You see, this kind of dirty work doesn't happen every day.</t6371> <t6372>I think Sam Bloxam might also be able to provide you with some information about what you want to know!</t6372>
<t6373>— If Smollet tells me the address of the guy named Sam Bloxam, - as I promised him - I will give him the remaining half of the gold coin.</t6373>
<t6374>Hearing my promise, he quickly drank the remaining tea in the cup and stood up, declaring that he would go everywhere to find that driver.</t6374> <t6375>Seeing me to the door, he told me:</t6375>
<t6376>— You see, I have no reason to keep you here.</t6376> <t6377>I can find this Sam guy right away, but maybe not.</t6377> <t6378>In any case, it won't be possible tonight.</t6378> <t6379>It's really hard to get anything out of this guy once he's had his fill of alcohol.</t6379> <t6380>If you leave me a stamped envelope with your address on it, I'll let you know as soon as I find out where he is.</t6380> <t6381>For now, I can only tell you this: it's best to meet him early in the morning, otherwise it will be quite difficult, because he usually wakes up very early and only comes home at midnight, completely drunk.</t6381>
<t6382>Listening to this guy talk, it seemed to make sense, so I asked his daughter to quickly run and buy an envelope and a stamp for me.</t6382> <t6383>In just a moment, the girl returned with what I needed in her hands.</t6383> <t6384>I carefully wrote the address, affixed the stamp, and handed the envelope to the kind homeowner.</t6384> <t6385>Before leaving, I repeatedly reminded him that as soon as there was any news, he had to inform me immediately.</t6385>
<t6386>So finally, the mystery is beginning to be unraveled! Gradually, step by step, one step at a time.</t6386><t6387>Tonight, I suddenly feel so tired, just wanting to go to sleep immediately.</t6387><t6388>Mina is deeply asleep, she looks even paler than the day before, and her eyes are swollen as if she had just cried.</t6388><t6389>Poor girl, ever since we stopped informing her about our plans and intentions, she seems even more worried and restless than before.</t6389><t6390>However, we were right to make such a decision!</t6390><t6391>It's better for her to be disappointed and anxious for a few days than to experience extreme tension when participating in our work.</t6391><t6392>The two doctors were really right when they advised me to keep her out of this dangerous game.</t6392><t6393>The important thing for me right now is to keep everything secret, no matter the reason, I must not let anything slip out.</t6393><t6394>I fully understand the burden of silence that is placed on my shoulders.</t6394><t6395>But after all, I don't believe it's something terribly difficult to do, because at this moment, it seems Mina herself doesn't want to mention our work anymore.</t6395><t6396>Indeed, since we decided to let her rest, I haven't seen her mention or hint at anything about Dracula and his schemes anymore.</t6396>
<t6397>• October 2</t6397>
<t6398>A day of exhaustion, stress that seemed never-ending.</t6398> <t6399>This morning, I received a letter addressed in my own handwriting.</t6399> <t6400>Inside the envelope was just a sloppily torn piece of paper with a scrawled address in pencil, the letters as big as hen's</t6400><t6401> eggs:</t6401>
<t6402>Sam Bloxam, Korkrans, 4, Poters, Court, Bartel Street, Walworth. Ask the director.</t6402>
<t6403>After reading the letter while still lying in bed, I quietly got up so as not to wake Mina.</t6403> <t6404>In her sleep, she looked even paler and more exhausted than when she was awake.</t6404> <t6405>Waking her now would be wrong, but another thought came to mind: after today's investigation, I will try to persuade her to return to Exeter.</t6405> <t6406>I think at home, even if she has to be busy with household chores, she would feel happier than being here with us without the right to know what is happening.</t6406> <t6407>Before leaving the house, I only met Dr. Seward and informed him where I was going today, what I was doing, and when finished, I would try to return as early as possible to report the results to the whole group.</t6407>
<t6408>When I arrived in Walworth, I suddenly became confused about finding the Potter Court. Smollet's sloppy and misspelled writing made me search for the wrong address all over the place.</t6408> <t6409>However, once I found the Potter Court, I just had to go straight to the Corcoran house.</t6409> <t6410>The homeowner informed me that yesterday, Bloxam came here, got drunk, and slept over, but at five o'clock this morning, he went straight to his workplace in Polar. Corcoran couldn't remember the exact location of the storage warehouse I wanted to ask about to find Bloxam; he only vaguely recalled that it was a "new and modernly built house."</t6410> <t6411>This was the only information I could get before heading to Polar.</t6411> <t6412>It wasn't until almost noon that I found the house I was looking for, thanks to the directions from a worker resting in a café; it was a "vast new warehouse."</t6412> <t6413>I casually asked the gatekeeper and a foreman.</t6413> <t6414>They were indeed very difficult and rude people.</t6414> <t6415>However, when I slipped each of them a coin, their attitudes changed immediately.</t6415> <t6416>And when I promised to pay the foreman a day's wage if he allowed me to meet Bloxam to ask him a few personal questions, he sent someone to fetch Bloxam right away.</t6416> <t6417>Bloxam was a rough and straightforward young man.</t6417> <t6418>I proactively promised to pay him for all the information he provided.</t6418> <t6419>Just waiting for that, he immediately told me that on the route from Carfax to a house in Piccadilly, he had to make two trips to transport all nine brand-new crates - all large and very heavy - using a rented horse-drawn carriage.</t6419> <t6420>But when asked about the house number in Piccadilly, he couldn't answer.</t6420>
<t6421>— It's really frustrating, boss, I don't understand why I completely forgot the house number, but I can tell you that the house I have to deliver the crates to is only two or three houses away from a whitewashed church, or something that looks like a church.</t6421> <t6422>It's a shabby house full of dust, but in fact, the dust here is nothing compared to the house I have to go to pick up the goods.</t6422>
<t6423>— So how did you get into these two houses if there was no one living there?</t6423>
<t6424>— The old shopkeeper waited for me in the house at Purneet and helped me load the crates onto the vehicle.</t6424> <t6425>Oh, my goodness! How is he so strong?</t6425> <t6426>I must say he is the strongest person I have ever met in my life, even though his beard was as white as snow, and he was so thin and frail that one might think he couldn't even push over a shadow!</t6426>
<t6427>I suddenly felt a shiver.</t6427>
<t6428>— Yes!</t6428> <t6429>The old man lifted the wooden crates as if they were just packets of tea, while I had to pant like a pig and strain with all my might just to lift one end.</t6429> <t6430>And I am not some old geezer!</t6430>
<t6431>— So how did you get into the house on Piccadilly? - I asked.</t6431>
<t6432>— When I arrived, he was already there.</t6432> <t6433>He must have driven very fast on the road to get there before me, because when I rang the bell, he was the one who opened the door and he was also the one who helped me carry the boxes into the hallway.</t6433>
<t6434>— Are there nine crates in total?</t6434>
<t6435>— Nine barrels.</t6435> <t6436>The first trip was one barrel; the next trip was four barrels.</t6436> <t6437>It was truly a laborious task!</t6437> <t6438>And I don't understand why the work made me so thirsty!</t6438> <t6439>At that time, I kept wondering how I managed to crawl back home.</t6439>
<t6440>— Have you brought the wooden crates into the hallway?</t6440>
<t6441>— Yes.</t6441> <t6442>It was an empty hallway, without any furniture.</t6442>
<t6443>— You don't have a key either?</t6443>
<t6444>— No keys! Nothing at all.</t6444> <t6445>The old man himself was the one who opened the door and then locked it when I left.</t6445> <t6446>To be honest, this is the latest time I can't remember everything because of the beer...</t6446>
<t6447>— So you really don't remember the house number?</t6447><t6448>?</t6448>
<t6449>— No, sir, but it should be easy to find!</t6449> <t6450>The house is tall, with a stone facade, low windows, and steps outside.</t6450> <t6451>I remember these steps because I had to carry the boxes up with three country lads who offered to help me in hopes of earning a few coins.</t6451> <t6452>The old man gave them a few shillings.</t6452> <t6453>Seeing an opportunity, they tried to ask for more, but the old man wouldn't have it.</t6453> <t6454>They were almost kicked down the stairs by the old man if they hadn't run away in time, cursing as they went.</t6454>
<t6455>Thinking like that was enough to find the house, so I paid Bloxam and made my way to Piccadilly.</t6455> <t6456>What I had just learned left me bewildered: the count could lift the wooden crates filled with earth by himself!</t6456> <t6457>Every minute passing now was very precious to me.</t6457> <t6458>Because it was very likely that he had already scattered the crates, one in each place, at the time he had chosen beforehand so that no one would notice.</t6458> <t6459>Upon reaching Piccadilly Circus, I got off the carriage and headed straight towards the west of the neighborhood.</t6459> <t6460>Just past the Juvenile Court, I immediately recognized the house I was looking for.</t6460> <t6461>I had no doubt that it was one of Count Dracula's lairs in England.</t6461> <t6462>The house seemed to have been abandoned for a very long time.</t6462> <t6463>The arched windows were all open, but every window was covered in a layer of dust.</t6463> <t6464>The dust of time had turned the wooden panels black and the iron decorations into objects that looked like they were made of earth.</t6464> <t6465>Looking at the balcony wall, I guessed there must have been a sign with the address and house name that had just been torn off, as the traces were still very fresh.</t6465> <t6466>I would have more information if that sign were still intact: it would tell me the name of the house's owner.</t6466> <t6467>I still remember how I gathered information to secure the brokerage contract for the Carfax house for Dracula before, and now I also believe that if I knew the previous owner of the house, I would be able to get inside.</t6467>
<t6468>So there's no reason to stay here any longer, what more can I know and do now? But I still made a round around the house, because who knows, I might find something interesting! The stables on the other side of the house were indeed bustling.</t6468> <t6469>I met a horse caretaker and asked him about the house.</t6469> <t6470>The information I received was that the house had been bought, but he didn't know who bought it.</t6470> <t6471>He also mentioned that about two or three days ago, there was a for-sale sign on the balcony, and if I asked the Mitchell, Sons & Candy agency, I might get the necessary information, as he clearly remembered reading the name of this real estate agency on the sign.</t6471> <t6472>Not wanting to attract attention, I had to thank the kind old man and leave without daring to ask more questions.</t6472> <t6473>It was getting dark, so I couldn't afford to waste time.</t6473> <t6474>Moreover, it's not like I didn't know the address of Mitchell, Sons & Candy; it's a brokerage with an office on Sackville Street.</t6474> <t6475>I needed to go there right away.</t6475>
<t6476>Receiving me was a polite but very taciturn employee.</t6476> <t6477>He only informed me that the house in Piccadilly had been sold and said nothing more.</t6477> <t6478>When I asked who had bought the house, he stared at me in surprise and then repeated in a gruff voice:</t6478>
<t6479>— It has been sold, sir.</t6479>
<t6480>— Excuse me, - I tried to remain polite - I would like to ask who that house was sold to, as I have some personal matters, which is why I am asking, please trust me.</t6480>
<t6481>He glared at me even more.</t6481>
<t6482>— I told you, the house has already been bought by someone, sir.</t6482>
<t6483>— Of course, but can you give me some details about this transaction?</t6483>
<t6484>— No, no, that's not possible, sir.</t6484> <t6485>With Mitchell, Sons & Candy, all client relationships must be kept absolutely confidential, please understand.</t6485>
<t6486>— Your company's clients must have been fortunate to find entrepreneurs worthy of their trust.</t6486> <t6487>To be honest, I am also in the same profession (I showed him my business card) and I did not come here out of curiosity, you can trust me on that.</t6487> <t6488>I came because of Lord Godalming's request.</t6488> <t6489>He asked me to gather some information about the owner, who recently tried to sell this house to him.</t6489>
<t6490>My words immediately changed the attitude of this mechanical employee.</t6490>
<t6491>— Is that really so?</t6491> <t6492>In the past, he once asked us to find a single house for him to rent when he was still the esteemed Arthur Holmwood.</t6492> <t6493>If you leave me the address of Lord Godalming, I will speak to my director on your behalf.</t6493> <t6494>After that, I will try to send a letter to the lord tonight.</t6494> <t6495>Surely there would be no breach of principle in providing your lord with some trivial information.</t6495>
<t6496>I could only thank the staff member and leave him Dr. Seward's address before saying goodbye.</t6496> <t6497>Outside, it was already dark.</t6497> <t6498>Feeling both tired and hungry, I had a quick cup of sweet tea before boarding the train back to Purneets.</t6498>
<t6499>When I got home, I saw everyone sitting in the living room.</t6499> <t6500>Mina still looked pale and even seemed more tired than in the morning, although she tried to appear cheerful with everyone.</t6500> <t6501>I felt a sharp pain in my heart thinking about how I had to grit my teeth and hide so many things from her, which only made her worry even more. Thank God! This would be the last night she would sit with us, feeling like no one trusted her anymore.</t6501>
<t6502>As for myself, I had to make a great effort to come to a fair and reasonable decision regarding her.</t6502> <t6503>Mina seemed to completely accept my advice.</t6503> <t6504>Or is it that our adventure is now truly frightening her?</t6504>
<t6505>Fortunately, we made a timely decision; otherwise, our new discoveries would be nothing short of torture for her, day and night.</t6505>
<t6506>We had to wait until the men could sit separately before I could report to the group about what I had just investigated today.</t6506> <t6507>Therefore, after dinner - and after relaxing with some music for a while - I went upstairs with Mina.</t6507> <t6508>I had never seen Mina so affectionate with me; she wrapped her arms tightly around me as if not wanting to let me go downstairs again. But I had many things to recount to the friends waiting below, so I had to go back down and leave my dear young wife alone.</t6508> <t6509>May God bless us! Although there are times we must remain silent about certain matters, the love between us will never change.</t6509>
<t6510>When I went downstairs, Dr. Seward and his friends were sitting around the fire in the room.</t6510> <t6511>I read to them the diary entry that I had just managed to write while still on the train.</t6511> <t6512>After listening to me, Van Helsing immediately remarked:</t6512>
<t6513>— A very important discovery, my friend Jonathan! There is no doubt anymore, we are about to find those wooden crates.</t6513> <t6514>If they are all hidden in the house in Piccadilly, then our work is almost done.</t6514> <t6515>But if any crate is missing, we will still have to struggle because of that crate!</t6515> <t6516>If we have all the necessary information, we only need to deliver a decisive blow to send that demon back to its true death.</t6516>
<t6517>We were lost in thought until Morris suddenly spoke up:</t6517>
<t6518>— How do you think we should enter that house?</t6518>
<t6519>— It's just like the abandoned house over there! - Lord Godalming replied immediately.</t6519>
<t6520>— Have you made yourself clear yet?</t6520> <t6521>It's not as easy as that! To get into Carfax, we could use a hook to unlock the door.</t6521> <t6522>Moreover, we have the cover of night and a lush garden surrounded by walls to protect us.</t6522> <t6523>But with the house in Piccadilly, it's a completely different story, whether it's day or night.</t6523> <t6524>To be honest, I still don't understand how we are supposed to get in there without someone lending us the key.</t6524> <t6525>Perhaps tomorrow morning, when you receive the letter from that employee, we should consider this matter.</t6525>
<t6526>Lord Godalming stood up and paced around the room, his face furrowed with thought.</t6526> <t6527>Then he stopped and looked at each of us in turn:</t6527>
<t6528>— Quincey has a point.</t6528> <t6529>Doing this is no different from stealing.</t6529> <t6530>We got away with it once, but this time it’s truly a difficult task... unless somehow, we get the count's key.</t6530>
<t6531>So we couldn't make any decision until Lord Godalming received the letter from Mitchell's company tomorrow morning.</t6531> <t6532>I could only take advantage of the time to jot down a few lines about the events of the day in my diary, then quietly go to sleep, feeling utterly exhausted.</t6532>
<t6533>However, there are still a few lines I cannot help but write down.</t6533> <t6534>Mina is sleeping very soundly with steady breaths.</t6534> <t6535>I suddenly feel a deep sorrow when I notice the wrinkles on her graceful forehead.</t6535> <t6536>It seems that even in her sleep, worries and troubles do not leave her alone.</t6536> <t6537>Tomorrow, I hope everything will return to normal when she can come back to our home in Exeter.</t6537> <t6538>Oh! Why am I so sleepy!</t6538>
<t6539>Dr. Seward's Diary</t6539>
<t6540>• October 1</t6540>
<t6541>Once again, I cannot help but talk about the case of patient Renfield. First, his temperament suddenly changed just when I managed to grasp the reason why he behaved one way at one moment and another way at another moment.</t6541> <t6542>On the other hand, when his mood changes are not solely dependent on his inner comfort, studying the irregularities in his behavior seems to bring me considerable professional benefit.</t6542> <t6543>This morning, when I went to see him after he had an unpleasant conversation with Van Helsing, his behavior was exactly that of a person who is completely in control of his destiny according to his subjective inclination.</t6543> <t6544>Indeed, he did not bother with worldly matters at all.</t6544> <t6545>He was living on cloud nine, and from that lofty place, he looked down on us with disdain.</t6545> <t6546>I thought of asking him in the hope of understanding something more:</t6546>
<t6547>— So, what do you think about the flies today?</t6547>
<t6548>He sneered at me with a condescending look:</t6548>
<t6549>— Flies, huh? You want to talk about flies, right?</t6549> <t6550>Let me tell you that this species always has a truly impressive characteristic; their delicate wings ideally represent the spatial strength of spiritual disciplines.</t6550> <t6551>Our ancestors were very wise to depict the soul in the form of a butterfly!</t6551>
<t6552>I really wanted him to continue his line of reasoning in a way that was logical to his thinking, so I didn't hesitate to respond:</t6552>
<t6553>— Oh! So is that the soul you are looking for?</t6553>
<t6554>He didn't know how to reason anymore, but he still shook his head vigorously and firmly replied:</t6554>
<t6555>— No, no, it's not like that!</t6555> <t6556>The issue is not the soul! I just want life and that's all!</t6556> <t6557>Moreover, I find life to be very fair to me.</t6557> <t6558>Life for me at this moment is perfect, I have everything I want.</t6558> <t6559>Doctor, if you want to delve deeper into mental illness, perhaps you should find yourself another patient!</t6559>
<t6560>— So you have arranged your life, you have reached the level of a saint, haven't you?</t6560>
<t6561>He smirked again with a condescending attitude, but this time it seemed less overbearing.</t6561>
<t6562>— Oh, no! I think it will be a long time before I have the attributes of God.</t6562> <t6563>In fact, I have nothing to do with His words or teachings.</t6563> <t6564>If I had to define my intellectual state compared to worldly matters, it would have to be on par with the rank of Enoch.</t6564>
<t6565>The words he said to me were really vague; in fact, I couldn't remember what position his character named Enoch held.</t6565>
<t6566>— On par with Enoch? Why so?</t6566>
<t6567>— Because he is compared to God.</t6567>
<t6568>Even though I couldn't understand any connection in what he was saying, I still didn't intend to voice my doubts.</t6568> <t6569>I wanted him to return to what he was saying at the beginning.</t6569>
<t6570>— So you don't care about the soul, and this life only moves you a little.</t6570> <t6571>Can you say why?</t6571>
<t6572>I asked harshly just to make him embarrassed, to see how he would respond.</t6572> <t6573>Perhaps I succeeded, because after a moment of futile thinking, he truly humbled himself exactly like his usual mediocre manner.</t6573>
<t6574>— Of course not, I don't need to worry about the soul, simply because I don't like it, and that's completely the truth.</t6574> <t6575>I only do what I can; the soul is of no use to me.</t6575> <t6576>I can't eat the soul, nor can I...</t6576>
<t6577>He suddenly fell silent midway, his face briefly revealing a cunning expression like a breeze rippling the surface of a lake.</t6577>
<t6578>— And what about life?</t6578> <t6579>Ultimately, what is it really, doctor? Once you have enjoyed what you want and never feel lacking, may I ask if you see any need to wait for anything else?</t6579> <t6580>Doctor, I also have good friends like you, and I know I will never lack what I need to have a place in this life.</t6580>
<t6581>I think that although his mind was wandering aimlessly, he still understood that I did not appreciate his theories at all, because after those seemingly sincere explanations, he suddenly fell silent.</t6581> <t6582>Knowing that continuing the conversation wouldn't solve anything, I left him alone in the room and went home.</t6582>
<t6583>But after a short while, someone came to my room and told me that Renfield was very eager to see me once more.</t6583> <t6584>Normally, I only visit him when there is a specific reason, but this time, I suddenly found him so interesting that I couldn't refuse his request.</t6584> <t6585>Moreover, if I refused him at this moment, I wouldn't know what else to do.</t6585> <t6586>Jonathan had to continue his new investigation, Lord Godalming and Quincey were not at home either.</t6586> <t6587>Meanwhile, Van Helsing was engrossed in reviewing the documents that the Harkers had prepared in my study.</t6587> <t6588>He didn't want anyone to disturb him unless there was a legitimate reason.</t6588> <t6589>In fact, I really wanted him to accompany me to Renfield's room, but thinking about the recent conversation between the two of them, I decided against it.</t6589> <t6590>Moreover, I feared that Renfield wouldn't speak openly if a third person appeared.</t6590>
<t6591>As usual, just seeing him squatting on the stool placed in the middle of the room, I immediately knew his mind was "thinking".</t6591> <t6592>As soon as he saw me peeking in, he immediately turned and asked, as if the question had been on the tip of his tongue all along:</t6592>
<t6593>— What do you think about the soul?</t6593>
<t6594>I was not mistaken: in psychiatric patients, just like in normal people, the mind occasionally still works in an unconscious state.</t6594>
<t6595>But I have to check and see.</t6595>
<t6596>— What about you, how do you perceive it? - I asked back.</t6596>
<t6597>He sat still without answering, his eyes shifting from the ceiling to the four walls around him as if he were seeking some object to inspire his response.</t6597>
<t6598>— I don't want a soul at all! - He answered in a mumble as if avoiding the truth.</t6598>
<t6599>I have a feeling that there is indeed a specific thought in his mind, and therefore, I decided to "push" for that truth.</t6599>
<t6600>— You still love life very much and really want to live, don't you?</t6600>
<t6601>— Oh! Yes, yes! Life is what we all want!</t6601>
<t6602>— But how can one have a life without denying the existence of that soul?</t6602>
<t6603>Seeing him appear confused by this difficult question, I continued to press:</t6603>
<t6604>— I really want you to have peaceful moments when you fly away from here with the souls of thousands of flies, spiders, birds, and cats, along with the chirping, buzzing, and meowing sounds all around!</t6604> <t6605>You have taken the lives of those creatures, so you should also accept a bit of their souls!</t6605>
<t6606>It seems that I have struck his imagination, for I saw him suddenly cover his ears, his eyes tightly shut like a child getting soap in their face.</t6606> <t6607>I felt an indescribable emotion, as if before me was a child, despite the face bearing the marks of an old man.</t6607> <t6608>In his mind, he must be going through another turmoil.</t6608> <t6609>Knowing well his reasoning and behavior from previous arguments, I thought I must be extremely cautious in understanding the intentions forming in his mind.</t6609> <t6610>First, I had to make him believe.</t6610> <t6611>I asked him, trying to speak as loudly as possible so he could hear clearly, for he was still covering his ears:</t6611>
<t6612>— Do you want to get some honey to attract flies?</t6612>
<t6613>He nodded, smiling as he answered, seemingly understanding the issue immediately:</t6613>
<t6614>— Oh! As you know, after all, flies are just poor little creatures...</t6614> <t6615>- He suddenly fell silent and then continued - But anyway, I don't want their souls buzzing around me all day.</t6615>
<t6616>— What about the spiders?</t6616>
<t6617>— I don't think much of spiders either! What use are they?</t6617> <t6618>There's nothing in the body of a spider that can be eaten or....</t6618>
<t6619>He suddenly fell silent as if he had just remembered something that couldn't be spoken.</t6619>
<t6620>“Good, good!” - I thought to myself.</t6620> <t6621>- “This is the second time he has gone silent when about to say the word drink.</t6621> <t6622>Why is that?”</t6622>
<t6623>He must have realized the mistake in his half-finished sentence, so he turned to another topic as if trying to change the subject:</t6623>
<t6624>— I don't care at all about things like shrews, mice, and all those tiny creatures that serve as food for chickens, if we speak like Shakespeare! I think we should end the discussion about these stupid animals! Making me care about these lowly creatures is like asking a European to use Chinese chopsticks to pick up tiny pieces of food! I always understand what awaits me?</t6624>
<t6625>— I know! What you want are those animals that you can bite into with your teeth.</t6625> <t6626>Do you need someone to bring you an elephant for breakfast?</t6626>
<t6627>— Crazy! You talk like a madman!</t6627>
<t6628>— Renfield, I was wondering what kind of soul an elephant might have? - I said, with a very pensive expression.</t6628>
<t6629>I achieved the desired effect on my patient's demeanor, as immediately afterward, he lost his haughty attitude and instead behaved like a child:</t6629>
<t6630>— I don't care about the soul of the elephant, nor do I need any soul at all.</t6630>
<t6631>Then he sat there motionless like a statue and didn't say another word.</t6631> <t6632>After a while, he suddenly stood up, forcefully kicked the stool aside, his eyes glaring wildly as if he had just thought of something.</t6632>
<t6633>— Damn you and your spirits! - He snapped. - Why do you keep bothering me with such wicked spirits? It's not just the spirits; there are so many other things in this life that make me so stressed and dizzy that I feel like I'm going insane, do you understand?</t6633>
<t6634>His sudden fit of rage startled me, as I feared I was about to receive a severe beating from him.</t6634> <t6635>Therefore, I had to immediately pull out the whistle from my pocket and blow it loudly to call the supervisors.</t6635> <t6636>He immediately softened his tone and apologized to me:</t6636>
<t6637>— Sorry, doctor, I forgot.</t6637> <t6638>You don't need to call anyone at all.</t6638> <t6639>There are too many concerns that make me lose my temper irrationally.</t6639> <t6640>If you understood the problem I need to solve, you surely wouldn't blame me.</t6640> <t6641>Please don't make me wear the straitjacket again! I need to think, and I can't think when my body is restrained like a prisoner.</t6641> <t6642>I hope you understand and sympathize!</t6642>
<t6643>Of course, he had completely mastered himself when he spoke to me in a gentle voice.</t6643> <t6644>When the wardens rushed over, I told them they could withdraw.</t6644> <t6645>Renfield stood still, watching them leave.</t6645> <t6646>After the door had closed behind them, he told me, his voice still gentle but somewhat more serious:</t6646>
<t6647>— Dr. Seward, you have indeed been very dedicated to me these past few days, and I truly appreciate your noble heart.</t6647>
<t6648>I just nodded and left, leaving him with the thought that he couldn't get out of his head.</t6648> <t6649>His case truly deserves my utmost attention for thorough examination and monitoring.</t6649>
<t6650>Now, I can draw out some points that I had not noticed about him for a long time:</t6650>
<t6651>He had never mentioned the word "drink".</t6651>
<t6652>He feared the thought of being disturbed by the "soul" of any creature.</t6652>
<t6653>He is not afraid of lacking what he needs "to live".</t6653> <t6654>He despises all forms of lower life, that is "small animals", although he suspects he is haunted by their spirits.</t6654>
<t6655>Logically speaking, all of this indicates that he has a very strong belief in a higher form of life.</t6655> <t6656>But he is very afraid of bearing a spiritual burden! That is his view of life!</t6656>
<t6657>But what about his faith? Where did that faith come from?...</t6657> <t6658>Lord, save us from suffering and distress! It was Count Dracula who came to him and planted the seed of delusional faith in his mind.</t6658> <t6659>Is there any more horror awaiting us?</t6659>
<t6660>• A moment later</t6660>
<t6661>I told Van Helsing about my suspicions regarding Renfield. It seemed that my story made him think a lot.</t6661> <t6662>After listening to me for a while, he suggested that I take him to meet Renfield.</t6662> <t6663>As we approached his room, we were slightly surprised to hear singing, a very cheerful voice.</t6663> <t6664>Entering the room, we were even more surprised to see sugar granules scattered all over the window sill.</t6664> <t6665>Flies, which are not plentiful in the autumn, began to swarm into the room.</t6665> <t6666>We intended to steer him back to the conversation I had just had with him, but it was futile; he kept singing as if we weren't even there.</t6666> <t6667>He was folding a piece of paper and then tucking it into his notebook.</t6667>
<t6668>We had no choice but to quietly leave as we had just arrived.</t6668> <t6669>Tonight, I have to watch to see if he plans to do anything suspicious.</t6669>
<t6670>Letter from Mitchell, Sons & Candy to Lord Godalming</t6670>
<t6671>"October 1st"</t6671>
<t6672>Dear Lord,</t6672>
<t6673>We are truly honored to have the opportunity to serve you again and to be permitted to provide you - at the request of Mr. Jonathan Harker - with information regarding the purchase of the hotel at 347 Piccadilly.</t6673> <t6674>According to the wishes of the executors of the will of Archibald Winter Suffield, this property has been sold to Count Ville, a foreigner who directly conducted the transaction and paid for the house.</t6674> <t6675>Beyond this, we do not have any additional details about this foreigner.</t6675>
<t6676>Hope to have the opportunity to serve you again.</t6676>
<t6677>Mitchell, Sons & Candy</t6677>
<t6678>Dr. Seward's Diary</t6678>
<t6679>• October 2</t6679>
<t6680>Last night, I ordered a guard to stand in the hallway outside Renfield's room to monitor him: he was not allowed to leave his position for even a minute, and if he noticed anything unusual, he had to report it to me immediately.</t6680>
<t6681>After dinner, we gathered around the fire in my room to smoke (of course, Mina had already gone to bed to rest).</t6681> <t6682>Everyone was lost in their own thoughts.</t6682> <t6683>Indeed, only Jonathan enabled our work to succeed, and we all acknowledged his crucial role.</t6683>
<t6684>Before going on break, I went back to the night supervisor to see if there were any issues.</t6684> <t6685>When I reached Renfield's room, I looked at him through the glass door: he was sleeping soundly with steady breaths.</t6685>
<t6686>But this morning, the warden came to report to me that shortly after midnight, Renfield suddenly woke up and kept screaming and babbling prayers.</t6686> <t6687>When I asked if there was anything else, the warden replied that was all.</t6687> <t6688>I became suspicious: perhaps he had fallen asleep.</t6688> <t6689>When I mentioned this, he vehemently denied that he had fallen asleep, claiming he had only "dozed off for a moment."</t6689>
<t6690>Today, Jonathan continues his journey with the hope of finding the traces he discovered yesterday, while Lord Godalming and Quincey go to buy horses.</t6690> <t6691>The Lord believes that at this moment, any information we are waiting for cannot be wasted due to our delay.</t6691> <t6692>From sunrise to sunset, we must find a way to neutralize the soil contained in the wooden crates; only then can we face the Count when he is almost powerless and without a hiding place.</t6692> <t6693>As for Van Helsing, he has gone to the British Museum to research ancient medical books.</t6693> <t6694>Ancient physicians often had concepts that we no longer accept today.</t6694> <t6695>The professor wants to find remedies against magic and evil that he believes will be useful to us later.</t6695>
<t6696>• After a while</t6696>
<t6697>We sat down for another meeting.</t6697> <t6698>If the traces of the old count are clearly discovered, then perhaps tomorrow will mark the beginning of the end of this terrible story.</t6698> <t6699>I wonder if Renfield's current calmness has anything to do with the present situation.</t6699> <t6700>If only we knew what was going through his mind from the time I talked to him until he started catching flies, things would have been easier to judge...</t6700>
<t6701>The warden suddenly rushed in to inform me that Renfield was in trouble; it seemed he had just had an accident.</t6701> <t6702>Hearing his pitiful cries, the warden hurried in and saw him lying sprawled on the floor, face down, covered in blood.</t6702> <t6703>I immediately rushed to his room...</t6703>
<t6704>CHAPTER 21</t6704>
<t6705>Dr. Seward's Diary</t6705>
<t6706>• October 3</t6706>
<t6707>I would like to recount exactly everything that has happened - as much as I can remember - since this diary was temporarily closed.</t6707> <t6708>I will try not to omit any detail that still lingers in my memory.</t6708>
<t6709>When I arrived at Renfield's room, he was still lying sprawled in a pool of blood on the floor, his body slightly tilted to the left.</t6709> <t6710>As I bent down to lift him up, I realized that he was severely injured, especially on his face: his face was the source of the blood pooling on the floor, it seemed as though he had been repeatedly slammed face-first into the ground.</t6710> <t6711>Bending down with me to turn him over, the warden stammered:</t6711>
<t6712>— He must have broken his spine.</t6712> <t6713>Look at him, his right hand, right leg, and the entire side of his face are all paralyzed.</t6713> <t6714>I don't understand how he had such a serious accident.</t6714>
<t6715>This is the question that made the proctor extremely surprised and embarrassed.</t6715>
<t6716>— I don't understand why at all. - He frowned and admitted. - Of course, he was injured because his face was repeatedly slammed into the floor.</t6716> <t6717>In the past, when I worked at Eversfield Hospital, I once saw a woman in a similar condition before someone managed to intervene in time.</t6717> <t6718>If his neck was broken, one could say he fell because he missed a step getting out of bed, but in this case, he was injured in the face and had a broken spine, it's really hard to understand...</t6718> <t6719>If his back was broken like this, how could he have slammed his face into the ground, and if he was already badly injured in the face before falling off the bed, there should be bloodstains on the bedding, right?</t6719>
<t6720>— Run and get Dr. Van Helsing here immediately - I ordered - I need him here right now?</t6720>
<t6721>The warden hurriedly ran to call, and a few minutes later he was seen rushing back with Van Helsing.</t6721> <t6722>Seeing Renfield lying on the ground, the professor observed in astonishment and then turned to tell me:</t6722>
<t6723>— A truly unfortunate accident!</t6723> <t6724>We need to monitor him continuously, don't leave him alone anymore.</t6724> <t6725>Perhaps I will stay with him.</t6725> <t6726>But now I need to go home and change clothes first, who would wear pajamas like this.</t6726> <t6727>If you are still here, we will meet again in a few minutes.</t6727>
<t6728>Renfield suddenly let out a roar, clearly experiencing the most excruciating pain of his life.</t6728> <t6729>A few minutes later, Van Helsing returned with a surgical kit in hand.</t6729> <t6730>While heading back to the changing room, he had already devised a solution for my patient.</t6730> <t6731>Before examining him, he whispered in my ear:</t6731>
<t6732>— Tell that supervisor to go outside.</t6732> <t6733>After the surgery, Renfield will regain consciousness, and I want only us to be here with him then.</t6733>
<t6734>— Thank you, Simmons, - I said to the warden - we have done everything we could.</t6734> <t6735>Now, we need to wait and see.</t6735> <t6736>Doctor Van Helsing needs to operate on him.</t6736> <t6737>Go visit the other patients.</t6737> <t6738>If anything unusual happens, come back and inform me immediately.</t6738>
<t6739>We waited for him to leave before we began to thoroughly examine the patient again.</t6739> <t6740>His face was only injured on the outside.</t6740> <t6741>The more serious issue was a rather long fracture in the skull.</t6741> <t6742>Van Helsing pondered for a moment and then told me:</t6742>
<t6743>— First of all, we must lower the arterial blood pressure to normal levels if possible, his pulse is terrifyingly fast, his skull is definitely injured, we need to perform a trephination to drain the hematoma immediately, otherwise it will be too late.</t6743>
<t6744>He hadn't finished speaking when suddenly there was a knock at the door outside.</t6744> <t6745>I hurried out to see who it was, and it turned out to be Arthur and Quincey, both still in their pajamas.</t6745>
<t6746>— I heard the invigilator calling Dr. Van Helsing and talking about the accident. - Godalming explained to me. - That's why I called Quincey to come here.</t6746> <t6747>The events that happened in succession were so confusing that the two of us couldn't sleep.</t6747> <t6748>To be honest, lying with my hand on my forehead, I suddenly suspected that tomorrow, the direction of everything around us might change.</t6748> <t6749>We have to reassess what has been left behind, and even look a bit further at what we have achieved so far.</t6749>
<t6750>— Can we come in?</t6750>
<t6751>I opened the door, invited them in, and then closed the door tightly again.</t6751> <t6752>Seeing Renfield lying in a pool of blood, Quincey asked, his face turning pale:</t6752>
<t6753>— Oh Lord, what has happened to this poor fellow?</t6753>
<t6754>I briefly summarized the events that had occurred and also expressed my hope to Van Helsing: Renfield would regain consciousness, even if only for a moment, after the surgery.</t6754>
<t6755>Hearing me speak, Quincey quietly sat down on the edge of the bed, and Arthur came to stand beside him.</t6755> <t6756>All of us attentively watched Renfield.</t6756>
<t6757>— We need to wait a moment, - Van Helsing told us - I have to check exactly where to make the incision to remove the blood clot.</t6757> <t6758>Clearly, the patient's hemorrhaging is becoming more severe by the moment.</t6758>
<t6759>Each minute passed by slowly and terrifyingly.</t6759> <t6760>We all fixed our eyes on Dr. Van Helsing, everything now depended on his diagnosis.</t6760> <t6761>As for myself, to be honest, I didn't believe Renfield could tell us anything.</t6761> <t6762>I didn't even dare to think about it.</t6762> <t6763>The breathing of the unfortunate man was becoming more and more interrupted, although there were moments when he gave me the impression he was about to open his eyes to say a few words.</t6763> <t6764>His groans also became more labored, he was sinking into a complete coma.</t6764> <t6765>I felt I could no longer bear the overwhelming emotions surging within me because of him.</t6765>
<t6766>Looking at the beads of sweat on my friends' foreheads, I understood that they were sharing the same feeling as I was.</t6766>
<t6767>It is clear that death could come to Renfield at any moment.</t6767> <t6768>I turned back and looked straight into the old professor's eyes for a long time.</t6768>
<t6769>— Don't waste another minute! - He said.</t6769> <t6770>- What he can reveal to us might save many lives.</t6770> <t6771>It might even open a path to redemption for his soul.</t6771> <t6772>We will remove the blood clot just above his ear.</t6772>
<t6773>The section where he immediately began his surgical work.</t6773> <t6774>The patient occasionally let out painful roars, then suddenly screamed a heart-wrenching cry.</t6774> <t6775>Right after that painful cry, he opened his eyes wide in bewilderment, his face showing both surprise and joy; I could even hear his sigh of relief clearly.</t6775> <t6776>He spoke while smiling, the corners of his mouth twitching:</t6776>
<t6777>— I will be normal again, doctor.</t6777> <t6778>Please ask them to help me take off this straitjacket.</t6778> <t6779>I just went through a terrible dream, it left me exhausted and unable to move.</t6779> <t6780>How is my face? It feels like it's burning.</t6780>
<t6781>He tried to turn his head to one side but couldn't; perhaps he had truly felt his own helplessness, as the eyes that had just lit up with joy were now turning vacant like those of a dead man.</t6781>
<t6782>Van Helsing observed and slowly told him:</t6782>
<t6783>— Renfield, please tell us about your delusion.</t6783>
<t6784>Recognizing the professor's voice, his face lit up despite the wounds still oozing blood.</t6784>
<t6785>— So it is Dr. Van Helsing!</t6785> <t6786>You are very kind to still remember me! Please give me a sip of water, my throat is burning dry here.</t6786> <t6787>Then I will tell you all...</t6787> <t6788>I had a dream...</t6788>
<t6789>He suddenly fell silent as if he was about to faint once more.</t6789>
<t6790>— Hurry up, - I told Quincey - go get me a bottle of strong liquor! It's in my room!</t6790>
<t6791>Morris returned almost immediately, holding a glass, a small bottle of liquor, and a jug of water.</t6791> <t6792>With just a sip, Renfield regained consciousness, his eyes reflecting an endless sorrow that I could never forget for the rest of my life.</t6792>
<t6793>— Surely I am not deceived by hallucinations, clearly this is not a dream, this is a terrifying reality! - He stared blankly around the room and stopped at the two people sitting on the bed.</t6793> <t6794>- If I still have doubts, their presence will help me confirm that I am living in reality.</t6794>
<t6795>He closed his eyes for a moment, not because of pain or fatigue, but because he wanted to focus his attention.</t6795> <t6796>When he opened his eyes, he hurriedly dove into the story with a determination greater than I had ever seen in him:</t6796>
<t6797>— Hurry up, doctor! Hurry up! I'm about to die.</t6797> <t6798>I feel like I only have a few minutes left to live!</t6798> <t6799>Then I will find death, or something much worse than that!</t6799> <t6800>Let me have another sip of wine.</t6800> <t6801>I have a few things I want to say to you before I die, or before my mind is completely paralyzed.</t6801> <t6802>Thank you...</t6802> <t6803>It happened the night I asked you to go home but you didn't agree and left, leaving me alone in the room.</t6803> <t6804>At that time, I really wanted to tell the truth, but the pressure didn't allow me to do so, even though I was completely sober, as sober as I am now.</t6804> <t6805>That day, after you left, suddenly I felt myself sinking into an unbearable, endless despair for many hours.</t6805> <t6806>Then, somehow, calmness returned to me, my spirit regained balance, and I became aware of where I was again.</t6806> <t6807>Suddenly, I heard fierce barking from the dogs behind the hospital, right near where the old man was standing!...</t6807>
<t6808>From earlier until now, Van Helsing has been intently watching Renfield speak and avoiding gestures that might distract his mind.</t6808> <t6809>Occasionally, he would grasp my hand tightly.</t6809>
<t6810>— Please, go on! - He gently said to the patient.</t6810>
<t6811>— And right after that, I saw the old man suddenly appear outside my window, surrounded by a layer of mist as I had often seen him before, but this time he didn't look like a ghost at all; instead, his eyes were glaring like those of someone in a fit of rage.</t6811> <t6812>He bared his teeth in a grin on his bright red lips, and when he turned to look at the bushes where the dogs were barking loudly, I saw his sharp, white teeth glint under the moonlight.</t6812> <t6813>At first, I didn't intend to invite him into the room, even though that was something he always wanted from me.</t6813> <t6814>But then, he began to make promises to me, and they weren't just empty promises; there were also immediate actions.</t6814>
<t6815>— How did the old man promise? - The professor pressed.</t6815>
<t6816>— What he promised was carried out immediately, for example, when the sun was shining, he drove a swarm of flies into my room.</t6816> <t6817>All of them were large flies with shimmering green wings.</t6817> <t6818>In the evening, he sent me moths with skull-shaped heads and striped patterns on their backs.</t6818>
<t6819>Van Helsing nodded to encourage him to continue speaking, but he mumbled a nonsensical sentence in a state of near unconsciousness:</t6819>
<t6820>— Acherontia Aitetropos of the Sphinxes...</t6820>
<t6821>But he also snapped back to reality immediately:</t6821>
<t6822>— The old man began to mumble: "Where are the rats, where are the rats, where are the rats! Hundreds, thousands, millions of them, so many lives."</t6822> <t6823>Where are the packs of dogs, the packs of cats, come and devour these vile creatures alive! All must bleed, the more blood that flows, the more years of life, no longer just flies, you know?" I laughed heartily, for I wanted to know what abilities the old man had.</t6823> <t6824>Just then, there was a loud barking of dogs down there, behind the bushes near the old man's house.</t6824> <t6825>The old man signaled for me to approach the window.</t6825> <t6826>I got up and moved towards him.</t6826> <t6827>He raised his hands to the sky as if to summon something without uttering a word.</t6827> <t6828>And then a dark shadow, from who knows where, suddenly descended on the lawn and rushed towards us with many red spots that looked like a cluster of fireworks.</t6828> <t6829>The old man pushed the enveloping mist aside.</t6829> <t6830>Soon after, I saw thousands of rats with fiery red eyes like the old man's, only smaller.</t6830> <t6831>Once again, the old man spread his arms wide: everything suddenly stopped.</t6831> <t6832>I had the feeling he was telling me: "All these lives and many more, I offer to you, and more importantly, they will belong to you from century to century if you kneel before me and worship me!"</t6832> <t6833>And then a blood-red cloud immediately appeared before my eyes, before I could even realize what I needed to do.</t6833> <t6834>I opened the window and called to him: "Come in, my Lord, my master!" The rats disappeared, and the old man slipped through the window, even though it was only slightly ajar.</t6834> <t6835>I felt he slipped in like a slender moonbeam through a narrow crack to appear before me with full authority.</t6835>
<t6836>Renfield's voice suddenly weakened noticeably, so I let him sip a bit more strong liquor, and he continued his nightmarish tale. However, his memory began to falter, and the events in his recollection risked not being pieced together coherently.</t6836> <t6837>I intended to prompt him to recall the part he had just mentioned, but Van Helsing stopped me and whispered in my ear:</t6837>
<t6838>— Let him tell it.</t6838> <t6839>Don't interrupt his train of thought.</t6839> <t6840>Reminding him now is impossible; he won't be able to add anything more once his train of thought is completely broken.</t6840>
<t6841>— I sat waiting for him all day, hoping he would send me something.</t6841> <t6842>But no, nothing at all... not even a fly.</t6842> <t6843>When the moonlight appeared, I started to get insanely angry at him.</t6843> <t6844>When I saw him slithering into the room through the still-closed window, I truly lost my temper.</t6844> <t6845>Seeing me go mad, he laughed gleefully, his eyes shining like fire through a shroud of mist.</t6845> <t6846>He acted as if my room was his own house, and I didn't exist at all.</t6846> <t6847>As he passed by me, his whole body emitted a very unusual smell.</t6847> <t6848>I couldn't hold onto him.</t6848> <t6849>I think that at that moment, Mrs. Harker had already returned to her room.</t6849>
<t6850>Arthur and Quincey anxiously stood up, stealthily stepping behind Renfield without letting him see.</t6850> <t6851>At this moment, despite being very worried and anxious, Van Helsing still had to remain silent and patiently wait for him to continue.</t6851>
<t6852>— When she came to see me in the afternoon, Mrs. Harker was no longer herself.</t6852> <t6853>I only suspected her presence when she began to speak.</t6853> <t6854>No, she was no longer herself.</t6854> <t6855>I no longer felt attracted to people with pale, wan complexions; I only liked those with rosy skin, and she seemed to have no blood left in her body.</t6855> <t6856>That didn't strike me immediately when she walked in, but when she left, I began to suspect that she had been drained of life by the old man, and I went mad again.</t6856> <t6857>Tonight, I also waited for him to come! Indeed, the layer of mist approached my room and crept inside.</t6857> <t6858>I was mentally prepared to grab that ghostly mist!</t6858> <t6859>It seems that mad people often have some kind of supernatural strength, and knowing that I am also a madman, at least sometimes, I decided to use that strength.</t6859> <t6860>It seemed that he sensed my thoughts, for he stepped out of the mist to fight me.</t6860> <t6861>Simply put, I didn't want him to continue attacking a woman, that's all.</t6861> <t6862>I stood firm, even feeling at times that I could handle him well, but when I accidentally met his gaze, my body went limp.</t6862> <t6863>It seemed that his wild eyes burned something within me, and my strength gradually faded away, like a weak stream of water.</t6863> <t6864>Just waiting for that, he suddenly grabbed me and flung me to the ground, even though I tried to hold onto him once more.</t6864> <t6865>Another cloud surged before my eyes with rumbling sounds like thunder.</t6865> <t6866>The mist coiled up, and in a flash, it disappeared under the door.</t6866>
<t6867>His voice grew weaker with each passing moment, and his breathing became more labored.</t6867>
<t6868>— Now, we know the most basic but also the most terrifying thing... - Van Helsing exclaimed. - So he is here, not far away, and we also know who he is looking for.</t6868> <t6869>Perhaps it is not too late yet.</t6869> <t6870>Let's find weapons, just like the other night, but quickly, don't delay even a minute longer!</t6870>
<t6871>There is no need to find words to describe our shock and fear at this moment.</t6871> <t6872>We ran frantically back to our room, looking for the items that had been used the day we entered the old count's house.</t6872> <t6873>The professor already had everything in hand, and when he reached the hallway, he showed us a handful and said:</t6873>
<t6874>— I always carry these things with me; they will be my inseparable belongings as long as our mission is not yet accomplished.</t6874> <t6875>All of you too, be cautious in everything you do!</t6875> <t6876>Because the Count is not an ordinary person, please remember that.</t6876> <t6877>Oh Lord! Oh Lord! Who could have expected Mina to suffer such misfortune?</t6877>
<t6878>His voice choked with emotion and then fell silent.</t6878> <t6879>As for me, I could no longer move swiftly, unsure whether it was anger or fear that had gripped my feet.</t6879>
<t6880>Upon reaching the door of the Harker couple's room, we suddenly all stopped.</t6880>
<t6881>— Should we wake him up? - Quincey asked.</t6881>
<t6882>— Yes, we need to wake him up, - Van Helsing replied - and if the door remains locked, we will have to break it down and enter.</t6882>
<t6883>— But doing so will scare them to death!</t6883> <t6884>Who would ever enter a woman's room like that? - Quincey said, in a very serious tone.</t6884>
<t6885>— Normally, you are right, but the issue now is a matter of life and death.</t6885> <t6886>A doctor can enter any room at any time and in any manner he wishes, and if that is not usually acceptable, tonight it must be acceptable for me.</t6886> <t6887>My friend John, I will turn the door handle, and if the door still won't open, you must push your shoulder against it strongly!</t6887> <t6888>The same goes for both of you.</t6888> <t6889>Now, shall we begin?</t6889>
<t6890>He turned the door handle forcefully, but the door didn't budge at all.</t6890> <t6891>Our whole group together pushed hard with our shoulders, causing the door to burst open with a bang, and Van Helsing lost his balance and fell, making us stagger and almost fall as well.</t6891> <t6892>While the professor had not yet managed to stand up, I suddenly felt weak all over, my hair standing on end like a porcupine's quills because of the horrifying scene in the room.</t6892>
<t6893>The bright moonlight cast a golden glow on everything outside, even though it was blocked by the orange curtain hanging on the window, it was still bright enough to illuminate the room.</t6893> <t6894>We could clearly see everything happening inside. John Harker was lying there, on the bed near the window, but his face was as red as a gấc fruit, his breathing heavy in a state of unconsciousness.</t6894> <t6895>Kneeling on another bed, at the edge of the bed near us, was the figure of a woman dressed in white, and standing right next to her was a tall, thin man dressed in black.</t6895> <t6896>Although they were not facing each other, we immediately recognized him as the old count.</t6896> <t6897>His left hand was gripping the woman's outstretched arms tightly, while his right hand grabbed her neck roughly.</t6897> <t6898>Seeing us burst in, he turned around abruptly: before us was a pale face full of demonic features, exactly as Jonathan had described in his diary.</t6898> <t6899>Yes, I recognized in that face two eyes blazing with anger, a hooked nose like a hawk's beak breathing heavily, and two sharp, white fangs behind bright red lips.</t6899> <t6900>In a fit of rage, he pushed the woman down onto the bed and lunged at us.</t6900> <t6901>But Van Helsing managed to raise the holy wafer in front of him, forcing him to stand still and retreat, just like with Lucy outside the tomb the other night.</t6901> <t6902>The more we advanced, the more he retreated and shrank.</t6902> <t6903>Outside, a huge black cloud suddenly drifted across the moon, plunging the scene into darkness.</t6903>
<t6904>When Quincey managed to turn on the light, all that was before our eyes was a thin mist slipping through the crack in the door.</t6904> <t6905>Van Helsing, Arthur, and I rushed to Mina's bedside.</t6905> <t6906>Her desperate scream echoed endlessly in my mind, making me feel that I would never be able to forget it for the rest of my life.</t6906> <t6907>She collapsed like a withered leaf, her face pale and twitching continuously, revealing sheer terror, while her eyes were vacant and lifeless like those of a mad person, and a small stream of blood was still trickling from her neck.</t6907> <t6908>Recognizing us, she covered her face as if to hide her shame and heartbreak.</t6908> <t6909>I understood that her scream was merely a temporary outburst of an emotion of boundless pain and despair.</t6909>
<t6910>Quincey stood dazed, looking at Mina, then quietly went outside without understanding why, while Van Helsing gently pulled the blanket over her and whispered in my ear:</t6910>
<t6911>— According to my experience, Jonathan is also falling into a state of extreme terror that only “vampires” can create.</t6911> <t6912>We cannot do anything for this poor woman until she regains consciousness, but as for Jonathan, we must wake him up.</t6912>
<t6913>The professor dipped a cloth into cold water and gently patted Jonathan's cheeks, while Mina continued to sob incessantly with her face in her hands.</t6913> <t6914>I pulled the curtain and looked out the window.</t6914>
<t6915>The cloud drifted away, and the bright moonlight returned.</t6915> <t6916>I suddenly noticed Quincey walking and then running across the lawn in the garden, disappearing under a cluster of pine trees.</t6916> <t6917>What could be happening? I really don't understand.</t6917> <t6918>At the same time, Jonathan's half-awake, half-asleep cry startled me and made me turn back.</t6918> <t6919>I could read the surprise on his bewildered face.</t6919> <t6920>It took him at least a minute to return to reality before sitting up.</t6920> <t6921>Perhaps his sudden cry and jerky movements woke Mina up.</t6921> <t6922>She quickly turned towards him, her arms outstretched as if to embrace her beloved husband, but then she hastily pulled them back to cover her face, her whole body trembling violently.</t6922>
<t6923>— Oh my God! - Jonathan knelt down on the bed and lamented. - What is happening?</t6923> <t6924>Dr. Van Helsing, Dr. Seward, what is happening?</t6924> <t6925>What has happened?</t6925> <t6926>Mina, what is wrong with you?</t6926> <t6927>Why is your body covered in blood?</t6927> <t6928>Oh Lord! Oh God! Please help us, please help her!</t6928>
<t6929>Then he leaped onto the floor as if ready to take action in response to the urgent demands of the situation.</t6929>
<t6930>— What has happened here?</t6930> <t6931>Tell me! - He asked insistently, as if he couldn't believe the truth, his face still showing signs of shock.</t6931> <t6932>- Dear Dr. Van Helsing, I know you have devoted your noble friendship to Mina.</t6932> <t6933>Please save her! You can do it, it's not too late yet, right doctor? Please take care of her, so I can chase after him!</t6933>
<t6934>Although her mind was still in turmoil, Mina somewhat understood the imminent danger approaching her.</t6934> <t6935>Forgetting all the bitter suffering, she tightly grasped his hand and pulled him back:</t6935>
<t6936>— Don't go, Jonathan! Don't go anywhere, my dear! God already knows my situation tonight! If you go, you'll only become prey for him, and how could I bear being without you at this moment.</t6936> <t6937>Don't leave me and go. Stay here with me and your friends!</t6937>
<t6938>The more she spoke, the more emotional she became.</t6938> <t6939>Her choked words made it impossible for Jonathan to leave.</t6939> <t6940>She pulled him to sit down on the bed and hugged him tightly.</t6940>
<t6941>Van Helsing and I had to try to find words to comfort the unfortunate couple.</t6941> <t6942>The professor held out the golden cross in front of them to soothe them:</t6942>
<t6943>— Don't be afraid of anything, my friends, we are here, as long as the cross is with you, you will not be unfortunate.</t6943> <t6944>Tonight, you are protected.</t6944> <t6945>Don't worry too much, we need to stay calm to think about what needs to be done.</t6945>
<t6946>Mina rested her head on her beloved husband's lap and did not complain any further, but her body trembled as if with fever.</t6946> <t6947>When she stood up, I suddenly noticed the piece of Jonathan's shirt on his chest stained with blood from her lips and other blood stains running down from her neck.</t6947> <t6948>As if realizing she had just been a victim of the Count, she startled and stepped back with a choking sob:</t6948>
<t6949>— Filthy, I have become a filthy person!...</t6949> <t6950>So I will never be able to embrace and kiss him again! Oh my God!</t6950> <t6951>Now I have become the most despicable enemy of him and everyone, I am the most contemptible person!</t6951>
<t6952>— Don't say that, Mina! - Jonathan comforted in a determined voice - Why are you saying that? I won't allow you to say such things for any reason.</t6952> <t6953>No matter what kind of suffering I have to endure, there's no way I would abandon you.</t6953>
<t6954>He hugged his petite wife tightly and held her close.</t6954> <t6955>She bit her lip, trying to stifle the sobs that seemed never-ending.</t6955>
<t6956>Finally, when the sobs of the gentle wife had subsided, Jonathan tried to calmly ask me again, although his voice could not hide the tension:</t6956>
<t6957>— Dr. Seward, please tell me what happened.</t6957> <t6958>I only see that she seems too...</t6958>
<t6959>Even though I didn't want to, I still tried to recount all the details of what had happened.</t6959> <t6960>He listened to me in silence, his eyes blazing with anger and a desire for revenge against that bastard.</t6960> <t6961>Despite that, he did not forget to caress the disheveled hair of his young wife.</t6961>
<t6962>As I had just finished the story, Quincey and Lord Godalming knocked on the door and walked in.</t6962> <t6963>Van Helsing gave me a look as if to remind me to take advantage of their reappearance to divert the conversation, so that the unfortunate young couple would no longer be too preoccupied with each other.</t6963> <t6964>I nodded slightly in agreement for him to talk to the two friends who had just returned.</t6964>
<t6965>— I ran outside to see where Dracula disappeared to, but I searched along the corridor and groped around in all the rooms and still couldn't find any trace of him. - Lord Godalming replied - I even went into Dr. Seward's office, but he had already...</t6965>
<t6966>Arthur suddenly fell silent when he saw Mina lying on the bed.</t6966>
<t6967>— You were about to say something, weren't you, Arthur? - Van Helsing pressed. - Go on, Arthur.</t6967> <t6968>I hope what you're about to say will be our way out.</t6968> <t6969>Speak, my friend!</t6969>
<t6970>— He must have entered the study, - Arthur continued - because inside, everything was thrown around, messy like a pile of trash.</t6970> <t6971>Books and papers were all burned to ashes.</t6971> <t6972>When we rushed in, the fire was still burning.</t6972> <t6973>The tape reels of Dr. Seward's diary were also thrown into the fire.</t6973>
<t6974>I startled and interrupted him:</t6974>
<t6975>— But I still have another copy stored in that chest, don't I?</t6975>
<t6976>Arthur sighed in relief and smiled at me, but then immediately fell silent.</t6976>
<t6977>— I ran down the stairs, but didn't see...</t6977> <t6978>I rushed over to Renfield's room, but there was nothing, if not...</t6978>
<t6979>— So what? Go on! - Jonathan urged impatiently.</t6979>
<t6980>— If it weren't for the fact that this patient had died.</t6980>
<t6981>Arthur lowered his voice and swallowed, trying to finish his sentence.</t6981> <t6982>As for myself, I couldn't shake the thought that Lord Godalming was hiding something from us, but because of the dire situation Jonathan and his wife were in, I didn't dare ask him, not even a single question.</t6982>
<t6983>Van Helsing turned to Morris and asked:</t6983>
<t6984>— And what about you, do you have any stories to tell us, Morris?</t6984>
<t6985>— There's not much.</t6985> <t6986>Maybe I'll be more specific later... it could be...</t6986> <t6987>In my opinion, before leaving here, we need to know where the old count has gone.</t6987> <t6988>We really don't know where he's hiding.</t6988> <t6989>I only saw a bat flying east from Renfield's window.</t6989> <t6990>I watched to see how it transformed when it reached the Carfax house, but it clearly flew off in another direction.</t6990> <t6991>So tonight he won't be back, as it's almost dawn.</t6991> <t6992>And tomorrow we cannot afford not to act.</t6992>
<t6993>Morris spoke through gritted teeth.</t6993> <t6994>His words left us speechless for a few moments.</t6994> <t6995>The silence made me feel as though I could hear the heartbeat of each person in the room.</t6995> <t6996>Van Helsing turned to comfort Mina and asked her:</t6996>
<t6997>— Mina, now can you tell us what happened?</t6997> <t6998>The Lord wants you to share this pain with us, but it is essential now that we know every detail related to you just now.</t6998> <t6999>More than ever, we need to act very quickly.</t6999> <t7000>We can reach the goal, but the opportunity will come faster if we know more about the situation to achieve the final victory.</t7000>
<t7001>Mina shuddered and leaned into her poor husband; I understood very well her tense state of mind at that moment.</t7001> <t7002>But then she also raised her face and tightly squeezed Jonathan's hand, looking very determined in response to the old professor's encouragement.</t7002>
<t7003>— I took the sedative pill that the doctor gave me, but no matter how long I waited, it had no effect.</t7003> <t7004>On the contrary, the more time passed, the harder it was for me to sleep.</t7004> <t7005>My mind started to become chaotic and confused, filled with countless terrifying thoughts, and all those bizarre thoughts led me to envision death at the hands of the "vampire," with blood, pain, and bitter sorrow.</t7005>
<t7006>Jonathan was shocked to hear his wife recount her feelings of sorrow and humiliation; clearly, he was also very tense, but she turned to gently comfort him:</t7006>
<t7007>— Don't think too much, my love.</t7007><t7008>You have to be brave and strong so that you can help me get through this difficulty.</t7008><t7009>If you understand that I had to try very hard to tell the terrible story tonight, then you will see how much I need your help and everyone's help.</t7009><t7010>- Saying this, she turned to look at us.</t7010><t7011>- Yes, I said I wanted to sleep, and I did everything I could to sleep.</t7011><t7012>Surely at first, sleep must have come to me quickly, because I don't remember anything else.</t7012><t7013>I don't even know when Jonathan came back.</t7013><t7014>I just suddenly woke up and realized he was lying asleep a moment later.</t7014><t7015>And the white mist once again drifted into the room...</t7015><t7016>Forgot, I don't understand if everyone knows what I'm about to say...</t7016><t7017>When you read what I just wrote, surely everyone will know about that white mist.</t7017><t7018>Indeed, I had a premonition of the presence of a stranger in the room, and a vague feeling of fear began to surge within me.</t7018><t7019>I turned to wake Jonathan but couldn't.</t7019><t7020>He slept so soundly that I felt like he was the one who took the sleeping pills, not me.</t7020><t7021>I felt my legs go weak as I stealthily glanced around the room, wondering what was happening.</t7021><t7022>I was terrified when I suddenly realized that right next to my bed, there seemed to be a man's shadow, tall but thin, just stepping out of the mist, or rather, the mist suddenly dissipated, revealing a figure dressed entirely in black.</t7022><t7023>According to the description I had read in Jonathan's diary, I immediately recognized it as Dracula. I intended to scream but couldn't, the fear had paralyzed my entire body.</t7023><t7024>He pointed at Jonathan and ordered me in a whispering, ghostly voice: "Shut up!</t7024><t7025>Otherwise, he will pay for it!</t7025><t7026>I will crush him right before your eyes!” Honestly, I didn't have the strength to argue back or make even the smallest movement.</t7026><t7027>He sneered contemptuously, then placed one hand on my shoulder, the other grabbed the nape of my neck and pulled my head to his chest.</t7027><t7028>“Now all my efforts have been duly rewarded! - He growled.</t7028><t7029>- Now, be quiet!</t7029><t7030>This is not the first time, nor the second time, that the blood within you has quenched my thirst!” I was terrified, but strangely, I didn't feel the urge to resist his craving.</t7030><t7031>I believe that is the result of one of the most dreadful curses weighing on his victims.</t7031><t7032>Oh! Lord, have mercy on me! Then his filthy lips pressed against my neck.</t7032>
<t7033>Jonathan gritted his teeth as if trying to suppress the pain inside, his body trembling with anger.</t7033> <t7034>Mina didn't know what else to do but to hold his hand tightly to share the feelings with her husband.</t7034>
<t7035>— The strength within me gradually depleted, I felt as if I was about to faint.</t7035> <t7036>I didn't know how long I had to endure that, only that the feeling persisted until he moved his filthy, blood-stained mouth away from my neck.</t7036>
<t7037>If Jonathan hadn't been by her side, she might have collapsed onto the bed, unable to bear the humiliation of recalling that disgusting image.</t7037> <t7038>But immediately after that, she tried to calm down and continued her story:</t7038>
<t7039>— Then he smirked, looking very contemptuous: "So you too, you also contributed to ruining my plan, you are an accomplice of those men trying to oppose me! But now, and soon enough, both you and they will understand the consequences of liking to obstruct others.</t7039> <t7040>They should have used their feeble strength for smaller, more trivial matters.</t7040> <t7041>I have crushed the plans of countless people over the centuries, and it will be the same for these ones.</t7041> <t7042>As for you, a very dear and precious ally of theirs, you now belong to me, you will be my flesh and blood, satisfying all my desires, and forevermore, you will be my companion and do-gooder!</t7042> <t7043>You will have time to rectify your mistakes, for those men cannot refuse you anything you demand of them.</t7043> <t7044>But now, you must be punished first for the crime of being an accomplice.</t7044> <t7045>You colluded with them to harm me. That's it!</t7045> <t7046>From now on, you will have to respond to my call.</t7046> <t7047>Whenever in thought, I call you: 'Come here,' you will immediately have to cross forests, mountains, and seas to meet me...”</t7047>
<t7048>Outside, a new day begins again.</t7048> <t7049>Jonathan remained silent, listening to the sorrowful and humiliating story of his gentle wife, his face darkened with beads of sweat.</t7049> <t7050>I was startled when I noticed the strands of gray hair sticking to his forehead.</t7050>
<t7051>All day today, our group had to take turns keeping an eye on the unfortunate couple, in case something bad happened so we could respond.</t7051> <t7052>Indeed, today, I can only be sure of one thing: the radiant sunlight is not enough to illuminate our house filled with sorrow.</t7052>
<t7053>We will sit down together again in a meeting with the hope of quickly finding the most reliable course of action.</t7053>
<t7054>CHAPTER 22</t7054>
<t7055>Jonathan Harker's Journal</t7055>
<t7056>• October 3</t7056>
<t7057>I feel like if I don't do something, I'll go crazy, so I have to write in my diary again.</t7057> <t7058>It is now half past six, in half an hour, we will have breakfast together in Dr. Seward's room.</t7058> <t7059>He and Van Helsing told me that no matter what, I must try to eat a little to have the strength to continue working.</t7059> <t7060>Today, who knows, there might be something that requires us to put in a lot more effort.</t7060> <t7061>I grabbed a pen and wrote a few lines here because if I stop, I'm afraid I'll start thinking all sorts of things.</t7061> <t7062>Indeed, everything we know so far hasn't been used for anything yet.</t7062> <t7063>But anyway, Mina and I still have to trust and hope for a good outcome in the end.</t7063> <t7064>My wife just confided that it is in such difficult times that we prove our loyalty to each other, so don't let ourselves be defeated by the circumstances, God will surely protect us to the end.</t7064> <t7065>To the end! Oh! God! To the end of what?...</t7065>
<t7066>When Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward returned from Renfield's room, we sat down again to discuss what needed to be done.</t7066> <t7067>First, Seward recounted to us the story of the patient: when they reached his room, he and Van Helsing found him lying on the floor, his face covered in wounds, and his spine shattered.</t7067> <t7068>In fact, Dr. Seward had previously instructed a hospital attendant to watch over and stand guard in the hallway outside his room.</t7068> <t7069>The attendant had not fulfilled his duty, as he admitted that during his watch, he had dozed off.</t7069> <t7070>It was during this dozing off that he was startled by Renfield's frantic cries from the room: “Oh God! Oh God!...</t7070> <t7071>Oh God!...” Following that was a heavy thud on the floor.</t7071> <t7072>When he rushed in, he saw Renfield lying sprawled on the ground, exactly as Seward had witnessed.</t7072> <t7073>Van Helsing asked the attendant if there had been the voice of one person or many, but he could not answer.</t7073> <t7074>At first, he felt that the room could not have contained only Renfield, but when he rushed in immediately after hearing the thud, he saw no one else.</t7074> <t7075>And he swore that only Renfield had cried out “Oh God!”</t7075>
<t7076>Dr. Seward told us that he didn't want to push the matter too far, as the authorities would surely conduct an investigation, and any further inquiry on our part would be of no use in revealing the truth, because no one would believe the truth we presented.</t7076> <t7077>He said it would be best to have the warden issue a death certificate for Renfield, concluding that he had an accident after falling headfirst from his bed.</t7077> <t7078>If an investigation were conducted, the authorities would only be able to reach such a conclusion anyway.</t7078>
<t7079>But then, what will we have to do?</t7079> <t7080>The time for decision has come.</t7080> <t7081>All the men among us agreed on one decision: if we cannot return to Exeter, Mina will once again directly join our group, and she will be informed of all our actions.</t7081> <t7082>Thus, she will have the opportunity to share in the joy, sorrow, and anxiety with us during each discussion, and it will also be an occasion for her to demonstrate her courage.</t7082>
<t7083>— Please, everyone, don't hide anything from me anymore, can you?</t7083> <t7084>I have had to remain silent and ignorant about many things already.</t7084> <t7085>Moreover, from what I have just learned, please don't think that I cannot endure anything more beyond the misfortunes I have experienced so far!</t7085> <t7086>On the contrary, I have a legitimate reason to hope and to demonstrate my courage in the face of anything else that might happen!</t7086>
<t7087>Van Helsing had been attentively observing her for a while now, as if he had noticed something unusual about her, because he suddenly asked her:</t7087>
<t7088>— But Mina, don't you feel scared after what just happened?</t7088> <t7089>It's not fear for yourself, I mean fear for the people around you!</t7089>
<t7090>Her face suddenly hardened, and her eyes sparkled, reflecting the acceptance of sacrifice of a martyr.</t7090> <t7091>She replied:</t7091>
<t7092>— No! No! Because I have already decided.</t7092>
<t7093>— Decision? - The professor asked, wide-eyed.</t7093>
<t7094>We silently looked at each other, as almost everyone could guess what she wanted to say.</t7094>
<t7095>She answered nonchalantly as if it were the most natural thing in the world:</t7095>
<t7096>— That's right! If I ever find that I no longer want the person I love, I will die!</t7096>
<t7097>—</t7097> <t7098>"You don't mean you're going to commit suicide, do you?" the professor asked in surprise, his voice hoarse.</t7098>
<t7099>— Of course...</t7099> <t7100>Unless I have a true friend who really wants to share with me the effort to complete such a terrible task!</t7100>
<t7101>She glanced at the professor with a subtle look in her eyes.</t7101> <t7102>Hearing her speak, he slowly stood up, gently brushed her disheveled hair, and solemnly said:</t7102>
<t7103>— Mina, you have a friend here.</t7103> <t7104>He will act if you fall into danger.</t7104> <t7105>God will bear witness to this, I will never back down from danger for my friends, if necessary, I can act right now.</t7105> <t7106>But, madam...</t7106>
<t7107>Emotions surged in his heart, causing him to choke up and unable to finish his sentence. It was only after a while, when he had calmed down, that he could continue speaking:</t7107>
<t7108>— There is someone who has stood between you and death.</t7108> <t7109>You should not die like this.</t7109> <t7110>No hand can push you towards death, except your own hand.</t7110> <t7111>Until the day the one who tainted your life truly dies, you will not be able to die!</t7111> <t7112>As long as there is an immortal being alive to commit crimes like him, your death will make you become like him.</t7112> <t7113>You must live!</t7113> <t7114>You must fight, fight for life, even when you think that death would be a good thing to do.</t7114> <t7115>You must fight against death itself, whether it comes to you in times of sorrow or joy, day or night, peace or danger!</t7115> <t7116>To liberate your soul, I suggest you do not die... or never think of death, until that demon is destroyed!</t7116>
<t7117>Mina's whole body was trembling violently as if she had a fever, her face pale like a real corpse.</t7117> <t7118>We remained silent, as no one knew what to say at that moment.</t7118> <t7119>It was only after a while, when she had calmed down, that she looked up and spoke to the professor in a sad voice:</t7119>
<t7120>— I promise you, our dear friend, that if God wants me to live, I will try my best until those terrible things come to an end.</t7120>
<t7121>Mina's courage and determination were like a breath of fresh air that gave us strength and bravery in the uneven battle against the cruel enemy awaiting us ahead.</t7121> <t7122>Yes, her heart made us accept the inevitable hardships to save her life.</t7122>
<t7123>I promise you that we will hand over to you all the documents stored in the chest as well as any papers, diaries, or tapes that we think will be necessary in the near future.</t7123> <t7124>During the time of organizing the documents, you should continue to keep your diary.</t7124> <t7125>The prospect of being busy with work seemed to make you feel more comfortable.</t7125>
<t7126>As usual, Van Helsing began pacing in front of us and reflecting on the entire situation from the beginning until now, after which he would tell us exactly what we needed to do.</t7126>
<t7127>— After entering the abandoned Carfax house, - he began to get to the point - I think we were right not to rush to touch the crates of earth in there.</t7127> <t7128>Otherwise, the Count would easily guess our intentions and would certainly find a way to prevent us from finding the remaining crates.</t7128> <t7129>Until now, he has no suspicion about our purpose, he doesn't even know that we have the ability to neutralize all his crates of earth, leaving him without a single safe haven.</t7129> <t7130>Now we have enough information so that after breaking into the house in Piccadilly, we will also easily find the remaining wooden crates.</t7130> <t7131>Thus, today will be very important for us, perhaps this will be the day that decides our final victory.</t7131> <t7132>The rising sun will illuminate our misfortune and will protect us until the last rays of the day fade away!</t7132> <t7133>Indeed, until then, that demon will not be able to change shape.</t7133> <t7134>He will only be able to hide within the layers of earth for shelter, he cannot blend into the air or squeeze through narrow gaps.</t7134> <t7135>If he wants to pass through a door, he will have to open it like any other person.</t7135> <t7136>Therefore, we will have an entire day to find and destroy his lairs.</t7136> <t7137>Tonight, even if we haven't caught him to destroy him, we must drive him into a place where he cannot escape from us anymore.</t7137>
<t7138>Hearing this, I could no longer remain silent: the thought that we were wasting every precious minute and second to reclaim joy and life for Mina was unbearable to me.</t7138>
<t7139>— When we talk, it is also the time we do not act!</t7139>
<t7140>As if understanding my impatience, Van Helsing waved his hand dismissively:</t7140>
<t7141>— Wait a moment, just a little longer, my dear friend Jonathan! - He said.</t7141> <t7142>- For something this important, we should not rush if we want to achieve ultimate victory.</t7142> <t7143>When the time is right to act, we will act!</t7143> <t7144>Think about it, considering all possibilities, the house in Piccadilly is likely the place that will help us clarify many issues.</t7144> <t7145>Dracula may have bought many houses.</t7145> <t7146>If so, he must have many house purchase receipts, checkbooks, and keys for each house he bought...</t7146> <t7147>All of those things must be kept somewhere.</t7147> <t7148>Why not in the quiet house in the middle of London, where he can come and go through the main gate or the side door at any convenient hour without being noticed?</t7148> <t7149>We will have to explore the Piccadilly house, and once we discover what is stored inside, we can completely hunt the old fox down to its den.</t7149> <t7150>What do you all think?</t7150>
<t7151>— Then let's go right away! - I urged.</t7151> <t7152>- Don't waste any more time hesitating!</t7152>
<t7153>— But how can we get into that Piccadilly house? - Van Helsing gently asked me.</t7153>
<t7154>— It doesn't matter anyway! - I replied impatiently.</t7154> <t7155>- If necessary, just use force to get in, what's the problem!</t7155>
<t7156>— What about the police?</t7156> <t7157>Is it possible that there are no police in that neighborhood?</t7157> <t7158>And if there are, would they all stay silent?</t7158>
<t7159>Clearly, he spoke quite reasonably, if he did not want us to set off immediately.</t7159> <t7160>However, I still tried to appear calm as I responded:</t7160>
<t7161>— You always worry too much, maybe there aren't any police...</t7161> <t7162>Can you stop thinking about such nonsense?</t7162> <t7163>I'm really suffering!</t7163>
<t7164>— My friend, I really understand your feelings! And I don't want to make things harder for you.</t7164> <t7165>But just think about it: what can we do when the streets are full of curious eyes?</t7165> <t7166>Granted, it's time for us to act, but I've thought about it a lot, trust me, my friend, the simplest way is always the best way.</t7166> <t7167>We want to get into that house without having any keys!</t7167> <t7168>That's also a problem, isn't it?</t7168>
<t7169>I nodded in response.</t7169>
<t7170>— That's it.</t7170> <t7171>Now, let's assume you are the owner of the house, but you don't have the key for some reason, what would you do?</t7171>
<t7172>— I will call a decent locksmith and tell him to open it with a hook.</t7172>
<t7173>— So the police won't come to intervene?</t7173>
<t7174>— No, if they realize that the locksmith did it at the homeowner's request.</t7174>
<t7175>— So, - He said, looking straight into my eyes - the only thing that can be doubted is whether the person entering the house is truly the real owner or not.</t7175><t7176>Additionally, the success of the operation also depends on the gullibility of the local police officers.</t7176><t7177>But my dear friend Jonathan, sometimes you can still use a hook to unlock hundreds of houses in London or anywhere else in the world without any trouble, as long as you create the right circumstances and do it at the right time.</t7177><t7178>I can tell everyone a story that I once read.</t7178><t7179>The story goes like this: There was a gentleman who owned a beautiful mansion in London. That summer, due to having to go to Switzerland for quite a long time, about five to seven months, he carelessly locked the house before leaving and didn't ask anyone to look after it.</t7179><t7180>As a result, shortly after he left, a thief broke the glass of a window facing the garden and broke in.</t7180><t7181>Once inside, he opened all the windows at the front of the house and boldly walked out the front door right in front of the police.</t7181><t7182>After that, he openly advertised the sale of all the furniture in the house with a huge advertisement board posted on the wall outside the gate. He hired an auction representative to sell all the belongings of the gentleman who was in Switzerland.</t7182><t7183>Then, he even sold the house itself to a building contractor because he found the ownership papers stored in the house.</t7183><t7184>The contractor discussed with him to demolish the house on a specific day to build a new building.</t7184><t7185>The police and city authorities thought he was the real owner of the mansion, so they facilitated this construction contract handover.</t7185><t7186>Unfortunately for the real owner of the house, when he returned from Switzerland, all he saw was a giant hole in place of his familiar house.</t7186><t7187>But what could be done, everything happened legally, following the city's buying and building regulations.</t7187><t7188>Perhaps our work should also follow similar principles.</t7188><t7189>We shouldn't arrive at Piccadilly too early to avoid the scrutiny of the police; only then will they not accidentally notice that our presence is unusual.</t7189><t7190>At the earliest, we should only start from ten o'clock onwards, because by then, passersby will think we are the real owners of the house.</t7190>
<t7191>I noticed Mina's face seemed to brighten up, as it was clear that Van Helsing made a lot of sense.</t7191> <t7192>Not only her, but all of us also acknowledged and hoped in his wise explanation.</t7192>
<t7193>— Once we are inside the house, - he continued to analyze - we might easily find more traces.</t7193> <t7194>In any case, we should leave one or two people there, and the rest must immediately go to Bermondsey and Mile End to find the missing wooden crates.</t7194>
<t7195>— If so, I can be useful to everyone.</t7195> <t7196>- Lord Godalming enthusiastically stood up and said.</t7196> <t7197>- I will send a telegram to have some carriages prepared for everyone.</t7197>
<t7198>— An impeccable idea! - Quincey exclaimed - But aren't you worried that such cumbersome travel through the roads of Walworth or Mile End might attract public attention?</t7198> <t7199>I think we should hail a cab along the way, as it would be more convenient to get on and off at any time and place.</t7199>
<t7200>— This fellow Quincey is quite clever! - Van Helsing joked.</t7200> <t7201>- Indeed, in our dangerous line of work, the less attention we attract, the better.</t7201>
<t7202>It seems that Mina is becoming increasingly excited, and I am also very happy to realize that she has temporarily forgotten her terrible night.</t7202> <t7203>However, she still looks very pale and gaunt, and her lips are so dry that they reveal both rows of her teeth.</t7203> <t7204>Although I didn't say it out loud, to be honest, I got chills down my spine when I associated Mina with Lucy after the times she was drained of blood by Dracula, except that I haven't noticed Mina's teeth being sharper than usual.</t7204> <t7205>But regardless of what is said, since I witnessed the horrifying scene last night, only a few hours have passed, and who knows if the worst for her and us might not happen similarly to Lucy's case...</t7205>
<t7206>Before arriving at Piccadilly, we decided that we must destroy Dracula's nearest hideout. Because even if he discovered us immediately, we would still have the advantage to continue our work.</t7206> <t7207>His manifestation as a normal person for many hours under the sunlight prevented him from using his magic on us, which might bring us new signs.</t7207>
<t7208>Van Helsing wants that after the action at Carfax is done, our entire group will go straight to Piccadilly.</t7208> <t7209>The two doctors among us will stay there, while Quincey and Lord Godalming will head to Walworth and Mile End to destroy Dracula's remaining hideouts. Van Helsing believes that there is a possibility that during the day, he might be at Piccadilly, and if that is the case, we will catch him.</t7209> <t7210>But no matter what, we must join forces to pursue him relentlessly.</t7210> <t7211>As for me, I do not entirely agree with his plan: I want to stay home to care for and protect Mina, but Mina is adamant about not listening.</t7211> <t7212>She says that the group might very well need me to resolve legal matters.</t7212> <t7213>She argues that among the Count's documents, there will surely be things that only I—who am familiar with Dracula—can understand, and in any case, to confront his extraordinary strength, we need as many people as possible.</t7213> <t7214>Her reasoning seems logical, so I cannot be stubborn.</t7214>
<t7215>— Only if everyone goes together will I have something to hope for.</t7215> <t7216>- She told me.</t7216> <t7217>- As for myself, I have nothing to fear.</t7217> <t7218>The most horrifying thing is over, and all that can come to me now is a bit of hope and comfort.</t7218> <t7219>You must go with everyone, my love! If God is merciful, then even if I am left alone, He will protect me as safely as everyone is protecting me now!</t7219>
<t7220>— Then in the name of God, - I said - let us set off immediately! The old count might arrive in Piccadilly sooner than we think!</t7220>
<t7221>— No, no! - Van Helsing waved his hand as if to calm my impatience.</t7221>
<t7222>— How did you know?</t7222>
<t7223>— Did you forget that last night he had a hearty feast and would wake up very late this morning? - The professor said with a sly smile.</t7223>
<t7224>Forget! Me, forget? Could I ever forget?</t7224> <t7225>Is it possible that any of us could forget something so horrifying?</t7225> <t7226>Mina tried to remain calm, but it seemed as though the pain in her heart had just been awakened; her restraint truly had its limits, as I saw her cover her face and sob, her whole body trembling violently from head to toe.</t7226>
<t7227>Van Helsing's inadvertent joke was clearly a stab into her wound.</t7227> <t7228>At this moment, he was startled by his thoughtless words.</t7228>
<t7229>— Oh! Mina, I'm sorry! - He rushed to the girl to comfort her - I didn't mean to hurt you.</t7229> <t7230>Actually, I'm in a lot of pain too! But you will forget that nightmare, won't you?</t7230>
<t7231>— No, I will not forget, - She sobbed in response to the old professor - on the contrary, I need to remember, and the beautiful memories of you will never fade in the hearts of my husband and me.</t7231> <t7232>Now, perhaps everyone is about to leave.</t7232> <t7233>Breakfast has been prepared, let's go down together, everyone needs to have strength now.</t7233>
<t7234>This morning's breakfast was quite unusual for us.</t7234> <t7235>We all wanted to encourage each other to cheer up a bit, even Mina tried to appear really cheerful.</t7235> <t7236>Finally, Van Helsing stood up and made an announcement.</t7236>
<t7237>— Dear all, the decisive moment is approaching! Have you prepared enough weapons like last time? I would like to remind you that these are the talismans against both physical and mental attacks, do you understand what I mean?</t7237>
<t7238>We nodded in response.</t7238>
<t7239>— Very great!</t7239> <t7240>Mina, no matter what, you don't have to worry about dealing with any danger until sunset.</t7240> <t7241>From now until then, we will return.</t7241> <t7242>If...</t7242> <t7243>Yes, we will return!</t7243> <t7244>No matter what, you don't have to worry too much, even if the enemy wants to come and harm you again, you have nothing to fear.</t7244> <t7245>When you came down from your room, I had already placed some necessary items there - which you surely know about - to prevent him from entering.</t7245> <t7246>And now, I will place a piece of the holy bread on your forehead, in the name of the Father, the Son, and...</t7246>
<t7247>All of us suddenly exclaimed in astonishment.</t7247> <t7248>The piece of holy bread suddenly burned a spot on Mina's forehead like a piece of metal heated to a bright white.</t7248> <t7249>The poor girl immediately understood what that phenomenon meant.</t7249>
<t7250>Her cry expressed not only physical pain but also an overwhelming sense of disappointment welling up inside her.</t7250> <t7251>That mournful cry will echo in our minds forever.</t7251> <t7252>She collapsed with an indescribable look of agony and despair on her face:</t7252>
<t7253>— Oh, the shame! I am a disgrace!</t7253> <t7254>So, God has punished me! From now until I die, I will have to bear this stain on my forehead forever!</t7254>
<t7255>Everyone stood stunned, watching her.</t7255> <t7256>I rushed over in shock to hold my poor young wife tightly, filled with fear and overwhelming disappointment.</t7256> <t7257>Despair left the two of us clinging to each other, not knowing what else to do.</t7257> <t7258>Understanding the heartbreak of my wife and me, our friends could only turn away and cry silently.</t7258> <t7259>Finally, as if to prove himself truly a father figure and the emotional support of the group, Van Helsing calmly approached us to comfort Mina, his voice as soft as a breath:</t7259>
<t7260>— Mina, the mark imprinted on your forehead signifies that the Lord has understood your pains.</t7260> <t7261>Perhaps you will have to bear that mark until the Lord deems it time to absolve all His devout followers on this earth on the Day of Final Judgment.</t7261> <t7262>Madam, on that day, we will surely be present to witness the stain on your forehead disappear, restoring the purity that has always resided in your heart!</t7262> <t7263>Surely it will be erased when the Lord, in His mercy, lifts the burden that weighs upon us.</t7263> <t7264>From now until then, we should always carry the cross with us, just as the Son of God bore it according to the will of the Lord...</t7264> <t7265>All hardships will eventually pass...</t7265>
<t7266>The sincere encouragement from the professor helped us understand that we need to endure when we must endure, and it seemed that behind that endurance, there was still a little something for us to hope for.</t7266> <t7267>Mina and I both felt it, we were truly moved, each of us bowed down, took one of his hands, and placed a kiss on it as a gesture of gratitude towards the heart of an old father.</t7267> <t7268>And before the sacred Lord, our whole group, without anyone telling anyone, knelt down together and swore to live and die together, united in strength and spirit, praying together for the Lord to help us overcome the calamity to complete our mission.</t7268>
<t7269>It's time for us to go.</t7269> <t7270>I turned to say goodbye to my dear beloved wife.</t7270> <t7271>Surely, this will be a momentous occasion that we will never forget for the rest of our lives!</t7271>
<t7272>We did not encounter any obstacles when entering the Carfax house.</t7272> <t7273>Everything in the house remained the same as the last time.</t7273> <t7274>There was no paperwork or anything that could indicate someone had entered.</t7274> <t7275>Likewise, in the church, there was no sign that the wooden crates had been moved, even by an inch.</t7275>
<t7276>— My friends, - Van Helsing told us - here, we have our first task to complete.</t7276> <t7277>We will have to neutralize the soil contained in the wooden boxes.</t7277> <t7278>This is the soil that has been sanctified by devout memories and was transported here by the demon Dracula as a place of refuge.</t7278> <t7279>The reason he chose this soil is because it has been sanctified.</t7279> <t7280>Whether he fails or not partly depends on the effectiveness of these boxes of soil.</t7280> <t7281>Now, we will return this soil to God!</t7281>
<t7282>He took a screwdriver and a universal key out of his bag to open the soil crates.</t7282> <t7283>A lid of a crate was pried open.</t7283> <t7284>The soil in the crate immediately emitted a musty, pungent odor that assaulted our noses.</t7284> <t7285>However, what caught our attention the most was what the professor was doing: he gently placed a piece of sacramental bread on the soil in the crate and closed the lid again with our help.</t7285>
<t7286>We also did the same with all the other boxes in the church and carefully screwed them back as they were originally to avoid drawing any attention.</t7286> <t7287>The work went smoothly.</t7287>
<t7288>As he locked the door to leave, Van Helsing exclaimed:</t7288>
<t7289>— So that's one thing done!</t7289> <t7290>For the other barrels, if we succeed in the same way, then this afternoon, before going to sleep, the sun might cast its last rays on Mina's noble and pure forehead!</t7290>
<t7291>When going down a small path on the way to the station to catch the train and continue our work, we passed by the mental hospital.</t7291> <t7292>I instinctively looked up at my room's window and caught Mina's gaze.</t7292> <t7293>I happily waved to signal to her that the work we had just done in our Carfax house had been smoothly completed.</t7293> <t7294>She also waved back and bid us farewell until my figure gradually disappeared behind a clump of trees at the end of a path.</t7294> <t7295>We eagerly headed to the station as the train was preparing to depart.</t7295>
<t7296>I can only write these lines while sitting on the train.</t7296>
<t7297>• Piccadilly, twelve thirty in the afternoon</t7297>
<t7298>We were approaching Fenchurch Street when Lord Godalming turned to me and said:</t7298>
<t7299>— Quincey and I will go find a locksmith.</t7299> <t7300>It's best if the rest of you don't come along.</t7300> <t7301>I think we need to be prepared for any unexpected difficulties.</t7301> <t7302>I mean situations where we might reluctantly have to break in.</t7302> <t7303>As a notary, it's probably better if you don't get involved!</t7303>
<t7304>I was about to argue back, but he brushed it off:</t7304>
<t7305>— Moreover, the fewer people there are, the less attention we will draw.</t7305> <t7306>My name can instill trust in the locksmith, and his reputable name will also instill trust in the police, if he...</t7306> <t7307>You go with John and the professor to wait for us at Green Park, across from the house.</t7307> <t7308>Remember to choose a spot where you can see the house. When the door opens and the locksmith leaves, the three of you will enter the house to meet us.</t7308> <t7309>We will wait and call all three of you in together.</t7309>
<t7310>— Sounds good! - Van Helsing praised.</t7310>
<t7311>And we temporarily separated after a stretch of road, Godalming and Morris jumped on a horse-drawn carriage, while the three of us called another carriage.</t7311>
<t7312>At the corner of Arlington Street, the three of us got out of the car and strolled into Green Park. I felt my heart pounding as if it were about to leap out of my chest when I caught a glimpse of the house in which we had placed so much hope for our success.</t7312> <t7313>It was a house lying quietly among other houses bustling with the sounds of life.</t7313> <t7314>We chose a bench from which we could observe the house and quietly lit cigars, waiting for the arrival of two friends and a locksmith.</t7314> <t7315>Each minute that passed felt like a century to us at that moment.</t7315>
<t7316>Finally, we noticed a horse-drawn carriage stopping in front of the house.</t7316> <t7317>Lord Godalming gracefully alighted along with Morris, followed by a locksmith carrying a toolbox.</t7317> <t7318>They slowly walked towards the steps.</t7318> <t7319>At the door, Godalming pointed to the lock that needed to be opened.</t7319> <t7320>The locksmith took off his outer coat, draped it over the railing, and turned to explain something to a policeman passing by on the street.</t7320> <t7321>The policeman nodded, said a few words, and then left, leaving the locksmith to start his work.</t7321> <t7322>He bent down, blew into the keyhole, and tried a large bunch of keys, finally finding one that fit after several attempts.</t7322> <t7323>Somehow, with just a slight nudge, the door swung open.</t7323> <t7324>The three of them immediately stepped into a hallway.</t7324> <t7325>We sat still, waiting.</t7325> <t7326>I kept puffing on my cigarette, while the cigar on Van Helsing's lips had gone out at some point.</t7326> <t7327>Nothing is more nerve-wracking than waiting.</t7327> <t7328>Finally, the locksmith swaggered out with his toolbox.</t7328> <t7329>He propped the door ajar with his knee, inserted a key, and handed it to Lord Godalming.</t7329> <t7330>After receiving his payment, he bowed to the "homeowner" and walked away.</t7330> <t7331>Clearly, no one had paid any attention to what had just happened in front of the house.</t7331>
<t7332>When the locksmith disappeared from sight, we eagerly left the park, crossed the street, and arrived at the house to knock on the door.</t7332> <t7333>Quincey Morris immediately opened the door, with Godalming standing next to him smoking.</t7333>
<t7334>— This house is disgusting! - The Lord told us as the whole group went further inside.</t7334>
<t7335>Indeed, the air in the house was filled with a smell exactly like the one we had first experienced in the Carfax house.</t7335> <t7336>There was no doubt about it, we were venturing into one of the count's hideouts.</t7336> <t7337>We checked each room one by one and carefully stayed close to each other, as the count could very well be hiding somewhere in the house.</t7337> <t7338>In the dining room at the end of the hallway, we found a total of eight wooden crates, while we had hoped to find nine! We slightly opened the small windows looking out onto a narrow stone-paved courtyard, separating the room we were in from a row of outbuildings—perhaps the stables—with no windows at all, so there was no fear of being seen.</t7338> <t7339>With that, we quickly took out the tools we had brought and opened each crate one by one, placing a piece of holy bread inside, just as we had done in the Carfax house.</t7339> <t7340>Having finished with the eight wooden crates, we continued our search.</t7340>
<t7341>After carefully inspecting every nook and cranny, we came to the conclusion that everything related to Dracula in this house was located in the dining room.</t7341> <t7342>Seemingly not satisfied, we told each other to meticulously check every item in the room again.</t7342> <t7343>Everything was thrown haphazardly on a very large dining table.</t7343> <t7344>There were many types of documents: deeds for the Piccadilly house, as well as the remaining houses in Mile End and Bermondsey, then writing paper, envelopes, ink bottles, and quill pens.</t7344> <t7345>A dust-covered piece of wrapping paper, a clothes brush, a hair comb, a jar, and a porcelain basin filled with dirty water that was red like blood.</t7345> <t7346>Finally, there were keys of all kinds and sizes, which I guessed were the keys to the other houses.</t7346> <t7347>Lord Godalming and Quincey Morris carefully noted down the exact addresses of the houses in Mile End and Bermondsey and took all the keys, putting them in their pockets to prepare to set off and continue destroying the remaining boxes of earth.</t7347> <t7348>Now, we will wait either for their return or for the appearance of the Count.</t7348>
<t7349>CHAPTER 23</t7349>
<t7350>Dr. Seward's Diary</t7350>
<t7351>• October 3</t7351>
<t7352>Time seemed to stretch endlessly as we waited for Godalming and Quincey Morris to return.</t7352> <t7353>Van Helsing tried every way to boost our spirits.</t7353> <t7354>I could sense his good intentions, as he occasionally glanced at Harker. How miserable he looked at that moment.</t7354> <t7355>Just recently, he was so lively, quick, cheerful, and full of vitality, yet now he looked like a decrepit old man, with hair almost half gray, eyes sunken deep in worry and sorrow.</t7355> <t7356>However, I believe that within him still lies a great deal of strength that will flare up whenever life's realities demand it.</t7356> <t7357>Poor fellow! How can we console him now? Professor Van Helsing also understood his state of mind very well, so he did everything he could to help him temporarily forget the constant worry in his heart.</t7357> <t7358>What he said to him seemed to be for the highest benefit of all of us.</t7358>
<t7359>— I have studied it a hundred times since I got the document about the demon.</t7359> <t7360>The more I study, the more I feel the need to destroy it by any means necessary.</t7360> <t7361>Everywhere I look, I see evidence of its growth; it grows not only in power but also in its own understanding of its power.</t7361> <t7362>According to what I have learned from my friend Arminius in Budapest, when it was alive, it was a man, a warrior, a general, and an extraordinary alchemist.</t7362> <t7363>Alchemy at that time was always a high-level expression of science.</t7363> <t7364>It must have been a person of extraordinary intelligence, unparalleled culture, and a heart of stone that knew neither fear nor remorse.</t7364> <t7365>In its being, the strength of its intellect remained intact even after its physical body perished, although its memory was not complete.</t7365> <t7366>To be precise, its mind was only comparable to that of a child.</t7366> <t7367>Yet it kept developing, some of its attributes suddenly matured from nothing and became perfected.</t7367> <t7368>It successfully experienced this through its own sinful life.</t7368> <t7369>If not stopped, it would surely become the progenitor or guide for a race of beings that only know existence steeped in death, unable to understand the true meaning of life.</t7369>
<t7370>Hearing that, Harker groaned and said:</t7370>
<t7371>— And then, who knows how many forces will be mobilized to oppose my young wife! But what are those experiences like? We must understand the old man to defeat him.</t7371>
<t7372>— Since arriving in England, he has never stopped testing his powers in a slow but steady manner; his intelligence, boundless strength, and complete mental focus are always used to their fullest extent.</t7372> <t7373>Fortunately, he is still in a childlike phase, because if he had recklessly attacked every target from the moment he departed from Dracula's castle, he would have been out of our reach long ago.</t7373> <t7374>However, he is determined to succeed, and someone who has left behind centuries like him can always wait and gradually move forward without any need to rush.</t7374> <t7375>Gradual progress, quick but not hasty, is always a principle in his mind.</t7375>
<t7376>— I am still very vague about what you just said.</t7376> <t7377>- Harker grumbled.</t7377> <t7378>- Please explain it more clearly.</t7378> <t7379>My mind is too sluggish.</t7379>
<t7380>Van Helsing smiled, gently patting the young man's shoulder:</t7380>
<t7381>— Alright, I'll be more explicit for you to understand, my friend! Have you noticed that over time, that demon has been increasingly enhancing its knowledge through practical experiences?</t7381> <t7382>You probably still remember that it used the name of the patient Renfield to infiltrate your friend John's asylum, because if a "vampire" wants to enter a stranger's house for the first time at any time, it can only be guided by an acquaintance.</t7382> <t7383>But that's not the most important thing.</t7383> <t7384>We know that initially, those heavy wooden crates were carried by others - not by it. It didn't realize that it could do much more than that.</t7384> <t7385>However, the utmost intelligence of a child gradually developed within it, to the point where it had to ask itself if it could lift the crates.</t7385> <t7386>It started by helping others lift the crates, and when it realized it was too easy a task, it tried to carry them alone.</t7386> <t7387>It succeeded and is now plotting to spread the crates around as hiding places, only it knows where they are hidden.</t7387> <t7388>It might plan to bury them deep underground.</t7388> <t7389>In the evening, or when it can change its form, these graves are very suitable for it to hide in, and no one can detect its movements.</t7389> <t7390>But don't be disheartened, my friend! Even if that knowledge is applied now, it's already too late.</t7390> <t7391>All the crates, except for one that we haven't found, have been rendered useless.</t7391> <t7392>I hope that before the sun sets, the last crate will meet the same fate.</t7392> <t7393>It wasn't until this morning that I had such confidence.</t7393> <t7394>But right now, the outcome is still uncertain.</t7394> <t7395>According to my watch, it's now one o'clock; if everything goes smoothly, our friends Arthur and Quincey should be on their way back. We must proceed ahead, perhaps slowly, but surely, and above all, not miss any opportunity.</t7395> <t7396>Just think about it!</t7396> <t7397>When those friends return, we will be five in total!</t7397>
<t7398>Van Helsing had not finished speaking when a sudden, rough knock on the door startled everyone.</t7398> <t7399>We anxiously stepped out into the hallway.</t7399> <t7400>The professor signaled for everyone to remain silent and went to open the door by himself.</t7400> <t7401>It turned out to be a postal worker! He handed the professor a telegram.</t7401> <t7402>After glancing at the address on the telegram, the professor quickly slammed the door shut as soon as the postal worker left.</t7402> <t7403>As he approached us, he opened the telegram and read aloud: "Beware of D. At 12:45, he hurriedly left Carfax and quickly disappeared to the south.</t7403> <t7404>He might be looking for you. Mina."</t7404>
<t7405>Jonathan Harker exclaimed, his voice tense:</t7405>
<t7406>— Thank God, we are about to meet face to face!</t7406>
<t7407>Van Helsing turned to encourage my friend:</t7407>
<t7408>— The Lord will act according to His way and timing.</t7408> <t7409>We need to be courageous, but we shouldn't rejoice too soon, because what we desire now might lead us to those very losses.</t7409>
<t7410>— Now nothing is important to me anymore - Harker coldly replied - except for getting rid of that vile demon from this world.</t7410> <t7411>Would I sell my soul for it?</t7411>
<t7412>— Oh! Shh, shh, my friend. - Van Helsing said.</t7412> <t7413>- God does not buy those souls, and the devils are not faithful customers.</t7413> <t7414>God is always compassionate and just, He knows your suffering and the love you have for Mina.</t7414> <t7415>As for her, she would be in much more pain if she heard the reckless words you just said.</t7415> <t7416>Do not fear anything, we are all united in our duty and nothing can shake that.</t7416> <t7417>The time to act has come.</t7417> <t7418>During the day, “vampires” are as ordinary as regular humans, they can only transform after the sun has set.</t7418> <t7419>They need time to get here.</t7419> <t7420>Look, it is only one twenty now, time will continue to pass before they reveal themselves to us - even if they move faster than ever.</t7420> <t7421>Hopefully, our two friends will arrive before them.</t7421>
<t7422>About half an hour after receiving Mina's call, we were startled once again when we heard the light but determined knocks on the door.</t7422> <t7423>We nervously stepped into the hallway, weapons in hand, and the professor gently pulled the latch and stepped back with me, ready to defend.</t7423> <t7424>Our joy surged to the highest level when we recognized the familiar faces of Lord Godalming and Quincey at the threshold.</t7424> <t7425>They quickly stepped in and slammed the door shut.</t7425>
<t7426>— Everything is fine. - Godalming said on the way into the hallway.</t7426> <t7427>- We found two hiding places scattered with six boxes of earth, all of which no longer exist.</t7427>
<t7428>— Why not? - Van Helsing asked in surprise.</t7428>
<t7429>— Was I speaking to the old count?</t7429>
<t7430>This is the first time Quincey has spoken up:</t7430>
<t7431>— There's nothing left to do but sit and wait here.</t7431> <t7432>But if we wait until five o'clock and he still hasn't arrived, we might have to go back. We can't leave Mina at home alone after sunset.</t7432>
<t7433>— He must be about to show up soon. - Van Helsing said while looking at his watch. - According to the telegram Mina just sent, he left Carfax heading south, which means he has crossed the river, that is, a little before one o'clock.</t7433> <t7434>If he is heading south, we can conclude that he still suspects our interference and from Carfax, he will first go straight to the place he suspects.</t7434> <t7435>You must have arrived in Bermondsey shortly before him.</t7435> <t7436>Since he hasn't shown up here yet, it proves that he then went around to Mile End.</t7436> <t7437>That detour cost him quite a bit of time, as he needed to find a way to cross the river.</t7437> <t7438>So we won't have to wait much longer.</t7438> <t7439>We should probably prepare our attack plan now, let's not waste any more time.</t7439> <t7440>Shh! He's here!</t7440> <t7441>Grab your weapons!</t7441>
<t7442>Indeed, we heard the sound of the lock turning outside the main door.</t7442>
<t7443>Although it was a tense moment, I still secretly admired Quincey's calm bravery.</t7443> <t7444>In all our adventures, he was always the one to organize the action plans, and Arthur and I always followed his arrangements to the letter.</t7444> <t7445>Now, as well, we immediately reverted to that daily habit.</t7445> <t7446>After scanning the room, he pointed to where each person in the group should stand.</t7446> <t7447>Van Helsing, Harker, and I stood right behind the door so that as soon as it opened, we could immediately block the intruder's retreat.</t7447> <t7448>Arthur and Quincey hid in a spot, ready to jump in front of the window.</t7448> <t7449>We anxiously, tensely waited as each nightmarish second passed.</t7449> <t7450>Slow, cautious footsteps began to echo quite clearly in the hallway outside.</t7450> <t7451>It was clear that the Count was expecting an attack, or at least he was afraid of one.</t7451>
<t7452>Suddenly, he burst into the room, catching us off guard.</t7452> <t7453>His leap had a certain grace and an inhuman quality that left us stunned.</t7453> <t7454>The first to act was none other than Harker. He leapt like lightning to block a doorway leading to the front room.</t7454> <t7455>Seeing us, he tilted his head back and laughed contemptuously, baring his sharp, jagged fangs, but he immediately fell silent, his terrifying laugh replaced by a malicious and sinister glare.</t7455> <t7456>His malevolence became more apparent as we slowly approached him.</t7456> <t7457>To be honest, at that moment, I no longer knew what to do.</t7457> <t7458>I didn't know if the weapons we carried would have any effect on him.</t7458> <t7459>Clearly, Harker intended to find out, as he angrily thrust a knife straight at him.</t7459> <t7460>The count could only escape thanks to a lightning-fast, demonic leap backward.</t7460> <t7461>Instead of piercing his chest, the knife's tip merely tore through his coat, spilling a stack of banknotes and a pile of gold coins.</t7461>
<t7462>The old man let out an angry, furious roar, which made me worry for Harker, even though I saw him raise a long, sharp knife, ready for a new attack.</t7462> <t7463>Instinctively, holding the cross and a piece of holy bread in my left hand, I quickly stepped forward to protect my brave companion.</t7463> <t7464>I felt my arm being guided by an invisible force, and it did not surprise me to see the demon stagger backward within our encirclement.</t7464> <t7465>The hatred and ferocity, anger and madness on the demonic face of the count were indescribable.</t7465> <t7466>His face gradually changed from purple-red to pale, in stark contrast to his fiery eyes filled with hatred. In an instant, he ducked under Harker's arm like a cat before he could deliver another powerful blow.</t7466> <t7467>He bent low, quickly grabbed a handful of gold coins, and then hurled himself through the window, shattering the shutters into countless glittering pieces.</t7467> <t7468>Amidst the sound of breaking glass was the clattering of gold coins rolling on the ground.</t7468> <t7469>Looking out the window, I saw him calmly stand up as if nothing had happened.</t7469> <t7470>He ran across the yard, kicked open the door leading to the stables, then turned back with a sneer:</t7470>
<t7471>— Do you think it's easy to mess with me?</t7471> <t7472>Look at you all, faces pale, bodies trembling like sheep in a slaughterhouse—how can you accomplish anything like that! Soon enough, you'll all regret it!</t7472> <t7473>Don't think I have nowhere to hide; I'm still here.</t7473> <t7474>My revenge has only just begun.</t7474> <t7475>This endeavor will accompany me through many centuries, and time is my ally.</t7475> <t7476>The women you love already belong to me, and through them, you and many others will also belong to me.</t7476> <t7477>They are all creations meant to carry out my commands, to serve me whenever I thirst for blood.</t7477> <t7478>That's how it is!</t7478>
<t7479>The old man threw his head back and laughed triumphantly and disdainfully, then slammed the door shut.</t7479> <t7480>We clearly heard the sound of him sliding the bolt behind the door.</t7480> <t7481>After that, there was the sound of the door opening and closing once more.</t7481>
<t7482>We understand that chasing him into the stable at this moment is very difficult.</t7482> <t7483>So, we have failed!</t7483> <t7484>The first person to speak was Van Helsing, he said as we hurriedly turned into the hallway:</t7484>
<t7485>— We have understood something, even a lot more than that.</t7485> <t7486>Even though he raised his voice to threaten us, it is clear that he is still afraid of us.</t7486> <t7487>If not, why would he run away?</t7487> <t7488>If I didn't mishear, his voice betrayed his true self.</t7488> <t7489>Why did he have to pick up those banknotes? Quickly chase after him! I believe there is nothing here that can help him anymore, even if he comes back.</t7489>
<t7490>As he spoke, he picked up the remaining banknote and stuffed it into his pocket, then gathered the soil documents and other papers that Harker had thrown on the floor and tossed them into the stove before lighting a match.</t7490>
<t7491>Godalming and Morris rushed into the yard, while Harker jumped through the window hoping to catch up with the Count.</t7491> <t7492>Indeed, he had bolted the door leading to the stables.</t7492> <t7493>When they broke down the door, they couldn't see any trace of him.</t7493> <t7494>Van Helsing and I circled around the back of the house to search, but all the stables were empty.</t7494> <t7495>No one saw the Count.</t7495>
<t7496>The afternoon passed quickly, giving way to the fading twilight.</t7496> <t7497>We understood that we had lost, with a heavy disappointment weighing on our hearts.</t7497>
<t7498>— Perhaps we should go back to Mina. - The professor told us.</t7498> <t7499>- There's nothing more we can do here.</t7499> <t7500>Anyway, we need to return soon to put her at ease.</t7500> <t7501>But remember, don't discourage her! We only have to find one more wooden crate.</t7501> <t7502>If we succeed, everything can still be salvaged.</t7502>
<t7503>I understand you are trying to comfort Harker, as he looks more disappointed now than ever before.</t7503> <t7504>Occasionally, he groans, perhaps thinking about his unfortunate wife.</t7504>
<t7505>We returned home in a gloomy mood.</t7505> <t7506>Mina was overjoyed to see us again, as if she had forgotten herself.</t7506> <t7507>But when she saw the dejected faces of the men, her face suddenly turned pale.</t7507> <t7508>She closed her eyes as if silently praying for the best.</t7508>
<t7509>— You know that nothing I do can ever repay you?</t7509> <t7510>Oh, my dear! - She said as she kissed her husband's forehead and his tousled hair.</t7510> <t7511>- Don't worry about anything anymore, let your mind be at ease for a moment.</t7511> <t7512>Everything will be alright, my love! God will protect us!</t7512>
<t7513>Occasionally, I see Harker groaning, looking very aggrieved.</t7513> <t7514>Disappointment leaves him at a loss for words to express his feelings.</t7514>
<t7515>As usual, we took a short rest before sitting down to a soup prepared by the servants.</t7515> <t7516>Dinner helped us feel more alert, as we had only had a little to eat since breakfast.</t7516> <t7517>Keeping our promise, we recounted the entire story to Mina.</t7517> <t7518>Clearly, she was just as disappointed as we were, as she occasionally turned pale while listening to us.</t7518> <t7519>I had told the whole story, and the only thing I could do now was go to sleep.</t7519>
<t7520>Jonathan Harker's Diary</t7520>
<t7521>• October 3 - 4, after midnight</t7521>
<t7522>It seemed like yesterday would never end.</t7522> <t7523>There was something urging me to fall asleep, a vague belief telling me that when I woke up, I would witness a change and from now on, everything would change favorably for us.</t7523> <t7524>Before wishing each other good night, we had a discussion about the next step but did not come to any conclusion.</t7524> <t7525>All we knew was: there was still a wooden crate where the old count could hide, and only he knew where it was hidden.</t7525> <t7526>If he chose to remain in hiding, he would force us to fail for many years, but what we needed right now...</t7526> <t7527>The prospect before us was truly terrifying, making me afraid to make any guesses.</t7527> <t7528>I am not sure about one thing, that is if there ever was a perfect woman, but with a tragic fate, it would be my beloved wife.</t7528> <t7529>The more I thought, the more I loved her to the point of heartache and the more I hated that demon a thousand times over.</t7529> <t7530>Surely God would not let this world be impoverished by the loss of a creation like her.</t7530> <t7531>So within me surged a hope of certain victory.</t7531> <t7532>Now we are lost and have only one anchor left, which is faith. Thank God, Mina slept without any troubling dreams.</t7532> <t7533>I am very afraid of what might be in her dreams stemming from her terrifying memories.</t7533> <t7534>Since dusk until now, I have not seen her show any signs of pain or distress.</t7534> <t7535>In a moment, I recognized the peace on her face, like the spring weather after the sudden rains of March...</t7535> <t7536>I did not feel sleepy, even though I felt utterly exhausted.</t7536> <t7537>However, I forced myself to sleep, needing to think about tomorrow.</t7537> <t7538>I will not be at ease until...</t7538>
<t7539>• A moment later</t7539>
<t7540>I must have fallen asleep, for I was just awakened when Mina startled awake in a panic.</t7540> <t7541>I easily noticed a faint light in the room.</t7541> <t7542>She covered my mouth with her hand and whispered into my ear:</t7542>
<t7543>— Do you hear anything?</t7543> <t7544>It seems like there's someone in the hallway?</t7544>
<t7545>I sat up, tiptoed across the room, and gently opened the door to peek outside.</t7545> <t7546>Morris was still lying awake on a mattress.</t7546> <t7547>Seeing me, he gestured for silence:</t7547>
<t7548>— Shh! Go back to sleep. Everything will be fine.</t7548> <t7549>We have to take turns staying awake to watch over you, because no one wants any more accidents to happen.</t7549>
<t7550>His gestures and gaze forced me to remain silent, and I could only turn around and whisper his words to Mina.</t7550> <t7551>She sighed in relief, wrapped her arms tightly around me, and said affectionately:</t7551>
<t7552>— Thank God for the kindness and courage of our friends!</t7552>
<t7553>She sighed in relief and continued to bury her head in a peaceful sleep.</t7553> <t7554>I took the opportunity to write a few more lines, because who knows, I might quickly fall asleep like her.</t7554>
<t7555>• October 4, morning</t7555>
<t7556>Mina woke me up again in the middle of the night.</t7556> <t7557>But in the end, we had a really full sleep, because when I woke up, I saw the dawn light outlining faint lines through the gaps in the wooden window frames, and the gas lamp was just a small, weak dot.</t7557> <t7558>As soon as she opened her eyes, Mina told me:</t7558>
<t7559>— Go find the professor! I want to meet him right now.</t7559>
<t7560>— But for what purpose?</t7560>
<t7561>— I have an idea.</t7561> <t7562>An idea that randomly came up in the night and matured even before I woke up.</t7562> <t7563>I want to be hypnotized before a new day truly begins, only then can I speak it out.</t7563> <t7564>Hurry up, time is running out.</t7564>
<t7565>I rushed out of the room.</t7565> <t7566>The first person I met was Dr. Seward.</t7566> <t7567>As soon as he saw me, he immediately jumped towards me, his voice full of panic:</t7567>
<t7568>— What's going on! Another bad thing...</t7568><t7569>?</t7569>
<t7570>— No, but Mina wants to see Dr. Van Helsing right now.</t7570>
<t7571>— Let me call him for you.</t7571>
<t7572>Before finishing the sentence, he was already seen running quickly to the professor's office.</t7572>
<t7573>About two or three minutes later, Van Helsing appeared in my room in his nightclothes.</t7573> <t7574>Morris and Lord Godalming also just ran to the door to ask Dr. Seward what was happening.</t7574>
<t7575>— Mina, you look so different! Look at that, my friend Jonathan, today we get to see a completely different Mina, just like the Mina from the old days!</t7575>
<t7576>After a few friendly greetings, as if to ease the tension he had just sensed, he gently asked my wife:</t7576>
<t7577>— What can I do to help you?</t7577> <t7578>Why do you want to meet me at this hour?</t7578>
<t7579>— I intend to ask you to hypnotize me.</t7579> <t7580>- Mina explained. - Please do it before the sun rises, because I feel that now is the moment when I can speak and speak very comfortably.</t7580> <t7581>Please hurry! We have very little time left.</t7581>
<t7582>Van Helsing did not say another word but gestured for Mina to sit on the bed.</t7582> <t7583>He looked straight into her eyes and began to hypnotize her with continuous hand movements up and down.</t7583> <t7584>Mina stared intently into his eyes for a few minutes...</t7584>
<t7585>My heart was pounding as if sensing an impending decisive moment.</t7585> <t7586>She remained motionless, her eyes gradually closing, with only the rise and fall of her chest with each steady breath indicating that she was alive.</t7586> <t7587>The professor continued to wave his hands a few more times before stopping, his forehead drenched in sweat.</t7587>
<t7588>Mina suddenly opened her eyes, but she truly looked like a completely different woman.</t7588> <t7589>Her voice sounded so sad, vague, and distant - something I had never seen in her before - and her eyes seemed to be gazing into some void.</t7589> <t7590>The professor raised his finger to his lips, signaling me to keep silent, and told the two people standing outside the door to step into the room.</t7590> <t7591>They tiptoed closer to Mina's bed after gently closing the door.</t7591> <t7592>It seemed as though she did not recognize them.</t7592> <t7593>Van Helsing broke the silence with a gentle and steady voice so as not to disrupt her train of thought.</t7593>
<t7594>— Where are you?</t7594>
<t7595>She answered in an indistinct voice:</t7595>
<t7596>— I don't know.</t7596> <t7597>Sleep has no place to be named.</t7597>
<t7598>The atmosphere of silence lasted for a few minutes.</t7598> <t7599>Mina remained still like a statue.</t7599> <t7600>The professor stood up and looked intently into her eyes, while the others seemed to be holding their breath. A new day was about to begin.</t7600> <t7601>Without taking his eyes off Mina, Van Helsing gestured for me to pull up the window curtains.</t7601> <t7602>A pale pink light flooded into the room.</t7602> <t7603>He continued:</t7603>
<t7604>— Where are you now?</t7604>
<t7605>Mina answered slowly as if she were deep in thought, seemingly trying to decipher something.</t7605>
<t7606>— I don't know.</t7606> <t7607>Everything is very strange to me right now!</t7607>
<t7608>— What did you see?</t7608>
<t7609>— Can't see anything, everything is pitch dark.</t7609>
<t7610>— So, did you hear anything?</t7610>
<t7611>Through Van Helsing's patient tone, I guessed he was very tense.</t7611>
<t7612>— The splashing sound, of water... very close by... and the small undulating waves... I hear those sounds outside...</t7612>
<t7613>— So, you are on a ship?</t7613>
<t7614>We exchanged glances, hoping to catch a glimpse of each other's thoughts, everyone afraid to think about the situation beforehand.</t7614> <t7615>Mina responded very quickly:</t7615>
<t7616>— Exactly!</t7616>
<t7617>— Did you hear anything else?</t7617>
<t7618>— The sound of hurried footsteps above my head.</t7618> <t7619>There was the clanking of chains and the resonant clicking of the winch axle.</t7619>
<t7620>— So, what are you doing?</t7620>
<t7621>— I am at peace...</t7621> <t7622>Oh! Very peaceful! Peaceful like a corpse.</t7622>
<t7623>She suddenly fell silent, let out a long sigh, and closed her eyes tightly.</t7623>
<t7624>At this moment, the sun had risen, and a new day began.</t7624> <t7625>Dr. Van Helsing placed his hand on Mina's shoulder and gently laid her down on the pillow.</t7625> <t7626>She lay still for a long time like a sleeping child, and after letting out a long sigh, she suddenly sat up and looked at the people around her, appearing very surprised.</t7626>
<t7627>But she only asked one question:</t7627>
<t7628>— Have I told everyone about my dream yet?</t7628>
<t7629>However, it seemed she understood our silence, even though she was very eager to know what she had just said.</t7629> <t7630>The professor recounted the story to Mina, causing her to exclaim:</t7630>
<t7631>— Then don't waste another moment! It might not be too late yet!</t7631>
<t7632>Quincey Morris and the lord rushed to the door, but Van Helsing calmly called them back:</t7632>
<t7633>— Wait a minute, everyone! That ship, even if it exists, has already set sail.</t7633> <t7634>Indeed, at this moment, there are ships setting sail from the port of London. But do you know which ship to look for? Thank God we have this information, even though we don't know where the ship is headed.</t7634> <t7635>Sometimes we are blind, as blind as mere mortals.</t7635> <t7636>Now we understand why the count was so determined to gather those banknotes even when Jonathan threatened him with a knife.</t7636> <t7637>He wants to flee, flee from England! He has only one crate containing filthy earth that can protect him, with many people hunting him like hounds chasing a fox.</t7637> <t7638>He has thrown that remaining crate of earth onto the ship and abandoned this country.</t7638> <t7639>He intends to escape us, but no, we will pursue him!</t7639> <t7640>He is truly cunning, and it is because of this cunning that we must track his footsteps.</t7640> <t7641>So am I, I am no less cunning, I understand his thoughts very well.</t7641> <t7642>In the meantime, we can rest comfortably without worry, for the sea has separated us from him.</t7642> <t7643>Come on! The sun is up, the whole day, until dusk, is ours.</t7643> <t7644>Take a bath, rest, and then have a little breakfast to feel better, for the count is no longer on the same ground as us.</t7644>
<t7645>Mina looked at the professor with a pleading gaze:</t7645>
<t7646>— But why are we not chasing him anymore? Is it because he has left us far behind?</t7646>
<t7647>The professor held her hand as if to comfort her:</t7647>
<t7648>— Don't ask anymore, dear Mina.</t7648> <t7649>After lunch, I will answer all your questions.</t7649>
<t7650>He didn't say anything more.</t7650> <t7651>We each went back to our rooms to prepare for breakfast.</t7651>
<t7652>After lunch, Mina repeated her question.</t7652> <t7653>Van Helsing looked at her intently for a moment before answering, his voice tinged with sadness:</t7653>
<t7654>— Mina, more than ever, now is the time we must find him at all costs, even if this search leads us to hell.</t7654>
<t7655>Mina asked insistently, her face turning pale:</t7655>
<t7656>— Why?</t7656>
<t7657>— Because he can live for centuries, while sooner or later we are just corpses.</t7657> <t7658>Time is our enemy - ever since the old count placed this mark on your neck.</t7658>
<t7659>Van Helsing managed to reach out just in time to catch her before she collapsed, unconscious.</t7659>

<t7662>"You should stay with your Mina.</t7662> <t7663>We will continue the investigation, if it can be called that, because we all know: we simply want a definite confirmation of the count's current status.</t7663> <t7664>Today, you don't need to do anything.</t7664> <t7665>That is the most worthwhile task for you at this moment.</t7665> <t7666>Today we didn't find him here, but I think it's necessary to tell you everything the four of us know.</t7666> <t7667>Dracula has gone, he is returning to his castle in Transylvania.</t7667> <t7668>He has had time to prepare everything, and the remaining box of earth is ready to be loaded onto a ship somewhere.</t7668> <t7669>Previously, he grabbed some money and ran because he was afraid we would catch up with him before sunset.</t7669> <t7670>That was his last hope, unless he had the chance to hide in Lucy's tomb, which he thought was still open.</t7670> <t7671>But he didn't have time.</t7671> <t7672>After being defeated, he planned to go straight back to his final lair.</t7672> <t7673>He is indeed clever!</t7673> <t7674>He understood the game was over here and he had no choice but to return to the place he had left.</t7674> <t7675>He knew he had to find a ship to escape.</t7675> <t7676>Now, we also have to find his ship.</t7676> <t7677>As soon as we complete the task, we will return to comfort you and your wife with new hope.</t7677> <t7678>It's not all over yet, Jonathan.</t7678> <t7679>The monster we are hunting took hundreds of years to reach London, yet in just one day we have driven him away.</t7679> <t7680>He has failed, although he is still strong enough to cause more harm.</t7680> <t7681>But we are not weak or cowardly.</t7681> <t7682>We are all determined to fight against his schemes, and our unity will give us a significant advantage over him.</t7682> <t7683>Be brave, dear friends! The battle has just begun, and victory will be ours.</t7683> <t7684>God above is always watching over each step of His children.</t7684> <t7685>Be patient and wait for our return.</t7685>

<t7688>• October 4</t7688>
<t7689>When Mina heard the messages recorded by Dr. Seward on the phonograph, she seemed much more at ease.</t7689> <t7690>Indeed, there is nothing more joyful than knowing the Count has left her country, and this very joy helped her recover.</t7690> <t7691>As for me, since the danger has passed, I feel as if I have regained the faith that I thought had long faded in my heart.</t7691> <t7692>Even the real experiences at Dracula's castle now seem like nothing more than past dreams.</t7692> <t7693>Here, amidst the golden autumn sunlight...</t7693>
<t7694>Oh dear! How could I have doubted? While lost in thought, my eyes suddenly and unintentionally stopped on the red holy wafer mark on the noble forehead of my beloved wife.</t7694> <t7695>It is an undeniable truth.</t7695> <t7696>The memory of that mark reminds us that we were not dreaming.</t7696> <t7697>I fear that today's idleness will cause both Mina and me to constantly think about all of our diary entries.</t7697> <t7698>However, as the memory of that terrible reality increases, it seems that the pain and fear within us gradually diminish, because we know the constant threat is no longer near.</t7698> <t7699>The thread running through the diary entries gradually appears in our thoughts as a silent comfort.</t7699> <t7700>Mina even joked that she would use those diary entries as material for a novel.</t7700> <t7701>Clearly, that thought has visibly cheered her up.</t7701> <t7702>I also tried to think like her to forget the wandering thoughts in my head.</t7702> <t7703>So far, we have never talked about the future together.</t7703> <t7704>But it is best to wait until Van Helsing and the others return before making any plans.</t7704>
<t7705>Mina Harker's Diary</t7705>
<t7706>• October 5, 5 PM</t7706>
<t7707>Recount our conversation.</t7707> <t7708>Those present: Professor Van Helsing, Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, Quincey Morris, Jonathan Harker, and me, Mina Harker.</t7708>
<t7709>Van Helsing recounted how he and his friends discovered Dracula's ship and found its location:</t7709>
<t7710>When I knew he intended to return to Transylvania, I was certain he would follow the route of the Danube estuary or some port on the Black Sea, because when he came to England, he had also taken that route.</t7710> <t7711>Omne ignotum pro magnifico.</t7711> <t7712>What is unknown is vast.</t7712> <t7713>We searched for ships heading to the Black Sea the night before with heavy hearts.</t7713> <t7714>According to Mina's description during hypnosis, it was a sailing ship, and such ships are not significant enough to be listed in the departure schedules of the Times. Lord Godalming advised us to go to the Hoyd dock to identify departing ships, including the smaller ones.</t7714> <t7715>Upon arrival, we learned that there was only one ship heading to the Black Sea at high tide, the Tsarine Catherine, anchored at Doolittle dock, bound for Varna and other ports upstream of the Danube.</t7715> <t7716>"Here it is," I thought to myself, "this is the ship with the Count."</t7716> <t7717>So we had to make our way to Doolittle dock, where we met a man sitting in a small, shabby hut.</t7717> <t7718>We asked for information about the voyages of the Tsarine Catherine.</t7718>
<t7719>He was a man with a face as red as a fighting cock, a voice that thundered like a storm, and he was always cursing.</t7719> <t7720>But anyway, he was quite kind.</t7720> <t7721>Quincey pulled out some gold coins and slipped them into the cloth bag hidden behind the man's coat.</t7721> <t7722>Just waiting for that, the man immediately became a reasonable person and very attentive to us.</t7722> <t7723>He led the whole group to meet the rough and hot-tempered sailors, but these strong men quickly became gentle after we offered them refreshments.</t7723> <t7724>They talked a lot about thunder and hell and many other things I didn't understand.</t7724> <t7725>However, they also told us everything we wanted to know.</t7725> <t7726>They said that yesterday afternoon, around five o'clock, they saw a very thin man with a long nose, eyes that blazed like fire, and very white teeth, walking very hurriedly.</t7726> <t7727>He was dressed in black from head to toe, except for a felt hat that didn't suit him, nor the autumn weather.</t7727> <t7728>He gave everyone money and inquired about the ships going to the Black Sea, but to which port? They led him to the exchange office and then to the ship he needed.</t7728> <t7729>He didn't want to board but stood at the pier asking to speak with the captain.</t7729> <t7730>The captain agreed to come down to talk to him but was still annoyed and cursed a few times.</t7730> <t7731>The man promised to pay generously if the captain agreed to his request.</t7731> <t7732>The man quietly left after being told where to hire a carriage.</t7732> <t7733>He returned very quickly with a rickety carriage carrying a large wooden box.</t7733> <t7734>He unloaded the box by himself, while it took several strong young men to struggle to get it onto the ship.</t7734> <t7735>He explained at length about the position and method of placing the wooden box to the captain.</t7735> <t7736>The captain seemed displeased, as he was seen cursing with every word he could muster.</t7736> <t7737>He said if the man liked, he could supervise the work himself.</t7737> <t7738>The man shook his head and replied that he couldn't, as he still had too many things to do.</t7738> <t7739>Hearing that, the captain reminded him to be very quick - suddenly there was a thunderclap that echoed across the sky - as the ship was about to set sail - another thunderclap roared - when the tide came in - yet another thunderclap.</t7739> <t7740>The man smiled and nodded.</t7740> <t7741>Of course, the captain would decide to set sail whenever he saw fit.</t7741> <t7742>The thin man nodded and promised to board just before they set sail.</t7742> <t7743>Then he asked if there was any place near the port that sold paper forms to buy a few sheets and immediately ran off to find them.</t7743> <t7744>The captain, red-faced and irritable, cursed a few times and then went back on board.</t7744> <t7745>No one knew where the man went, as they had other things to think about, possibly thunder and hell, because they immediately realized that the ship Tsarine Catherine couldn't set sail as planned.</t7745> <t7746>A mist suddenly rose on the river, then thickened into a fog that danced around the ship.</t7746> <t7747>The captain let out some vicious curses.</t7747> <t7748>The tide continued to rise, higher and higher.</t7748> <t7749>The captain began to worry about missing the tide, and he was getting angry when the old passenger suddenly reappeared at the pier.</t7749> <t7750>As soon as he saw the captain, he demanded to see where his wooden box was stored.</t7750> <t7751>Hearing that, the captain said he just wanted to throw both the man and the box into the river to vent his anger.</t7751> <t7752>The man wasn't offended but calmly went down to the hold to check the box and then immediately came back up.</t7752> <t7753>He stood still on the deck, amidst the thick fog.</t7753> <t7754>Surely, he disappeared somewhere alone and no one saw him, but honestly, no one paid attention to him, as the fog began to disperse, leaving a clear scene as it originally was.</t7754> <t7755>While enjoying free refreshments, our new friends laughed until they cried as they recounted the captain's curses, then they asked some sailors scattered on the river when the ship Tsarine Catherine was preparing to depart.</t7755> <t7756>These guys replied that they didn't see fog anywhere else on the river, except for the fog surrounding the man's ship.</t7756> <t7757>Finally, the ship set sail in the morning, when the tide had dropped quite low.</t7757>
<t7758>When we were sitting and talking with the sailors, the ship was surely drifting far offshore after having sailed downstream to the lower reaches of the river.</t7758> <t7759>Mina, we had a moment to rest comfortably, if I can say so, because after all, our enemy was floating on the sea on his way to the Danube River along with the obedient fog.</t7759> <t7760>However, if he travels by sea, it will take quite a bit of time, I mean if he travels by land, we can catch up with him.</t7760> <t7761>Our best chance to strike a decisive blow is when he is lying in the box of earth, between sunrise and sunset.</t7761> <t7762>Because at that time, he cannot defend himself, and his fate will depend on us.</t7762> <t7763>We still have many days ahead to carry out our plan.</t7763> <t7764>We know where he is headed, because we met the owner of the ship Tsarine Catherine, who provided us with information related to his papers and destination.</t7764> <t7765>The wooden box must be unloaded at Varna and delivered to an agent named Ristics, as he is the one authorized by him to receive the goods directly from the captain.</t7765> <t7766>The kind ship owner also said that if we encounter difficulties, he could send a telegram to Varna to help.</t7766> <t7767>We replied that it was not necessary, because in the remaining journey, we must not let the police or customs get involved, otherwise everything will be ruined.</t7767> <t7768>We must complete our mission ourselves in our own way.</t7768>
<t7769>After Van Helsing finished speaking, I dared to ask him if he was sure the count was on the ship.</t7769>
<t7770>— We have the most solid evidence to assert that it exists.</t7770> <t7771>- He replied.</t7771>
<t7772>— That is precisely the evidence confirmed from the moment I hypnotized her.</t7772>
<t7773>I continued to ask if it was absolutely necessary to chase after the old man, because I was really afraid that Jonathan would leave me at this moment. I was certain that he would go if those other friends did the same.</t7773> <t7774>He enthusiastically answered me with a voice full of unwavering confidence, though still very calm, making everyone feel that he was an indispensable support for our group at this time.</t7774>
<t7775>— Yes, absolutely necessary!</t7775> <t7776>First of all, because of you, Mina, and then for all of humanity living in this world.</t7776> <t7777>This demon has caused untold suffering to those who exist within its reach and in a short period of time - I mean short compared to its potential eternal existence - when it was just a corpse groping to discover itself in the dark, not yet fully aware of its powers.</t7777> <t7778>I have told everything to our friends.</t7778> <t7779>And you too, Mina, you will understand this through Dr. John's phonograph or through your husband's diary.</t7779> <t7780>I told them: the decision to leave the barren, desolate, and uninhabited land of the Count to come to a new, populous, and sunlit land is a task that must span centuries.</t7780> <t7781>To achieve what he has now, another demon among the immortals in this world would have to go through many more centuries to perfect its powers.</t7781> <t7782>But for him, all the forces of nature, of the mystical and the supernatural, have been gathered into a supernatural power in a miraculous way.</t7782> <t7783>For many centuries, in the place where he lived, that immortal being accumulated countless mysteries of geology and chemistry.</t7783> <t7784>And within himself, at the beginning, there existed some extraordinary qualities.</t7784> <t7785>In a time of brutal war, he was recognized for his steel nerves, enduring spirit, a braver heart than anyone else in the world, and a robust, tall, and strong physique as powerful as his mind.</t7785> <t7786>All of this existed independently of the demonic assistance that he later achieved, but his demonic soul must ultimately retreat before the good.</t7786> <t7787>Yes, now is the time he must confront us.</t7787> <t7788>He has marked you - oh, forgive me, dear Mina, if I say so, I only want to place him in your interest, that's all!</t7788> <t7789>He marked you so cunningly that even if he did nothing more to you, it would be enough for you to live normally like everyone else at first, but then death, a common fate decreed by God, would one day make you become like him.</t7789> <t7790>We must find a way to prevent that from happening.</t7790> <t7791>This world and God's faithful cannot fall into the hands of the evil demons.</t7791> <t7792>We will set out like Crusaders to fulfill the mission that He has entrusted to us.</t7792> <t7793>We will also go east like them, and if we fall, it will be an honor for the goodness of this world.</t7793>
<t7794>Waiting for him to stop, I then asked:</t7794>
<t7795>— But wouldn't the old count become wiser after this failure?</t7795> <t7796>After being expelled from England, wouldn't he avoid it like a tiger fleeing from the village where it just received a severe beating?</t7796>
<t7797>— You speak well! - He replied, not sure if it was a compliment or a criticism. - Your Mr. Thirty, once he has tasted human blood, will no longer care about any other prey, but that doesn't mean he won't continue to lurk and prowl until he finds new prey, following the unchangeable instincts of a wild beast.</t7797><t7798>The one we are hunting is no different from a tiger that never forgets to hunt.</t7798><t7799>He is not the type to just curl up in a remote place.</t7799><t7800>When he was alive, I mean living a real life, he crossed the Turkish border to attack enemy lands.</t7800><t7801>He could be pushed back but never stopped.</t7801><t7802>After each failure, he attacked, attacked, and attacked again.</t7802><t7803>Just look at his stubborn and obstinate nature.</t7803><t7804>His childish mind had long been brewing the idea of living in a big city.</t7804><t7805>But for what purpose? He would find there the most promises to quickly test his strength and power.</t7805><t7806>He learned foreign languages, explored a different social life to change his outdated habits, then studied politics, law, finance, science, as well as the customs and traditions of a new land, a new nation born long after him.</t7806><t7807>The mere glimpse of these things stimulated his craving, and they seemed to merge into his being: because everything proved that his assumptions about this world were very accurate.</t7807><t7808>He did everything alone, all by himself, from a desolate grave at the end of a forgotten land.</t7808><t7809>How much more could he do when the whole world was expanding in his imagination!</t7809><t7810>He could laugh at death, as we know.</t7810><t7811>He was fully capable of commanding patients to kill all the peoples on earth.</t7811><t7812>Heavens! If such a being were sent by God; not driven by demons, how much would this world benefit?</t7812><t7813>But fortunately, life still has us.</t7813><t7814>Our efforts must be kept secret, or rather, we must be silent in our mission, because in this age of enlightenment, when people no longer believe what they see, the lack of faith in seemingly mythical things is even greater.</t7814><t7815>He will use that lack of faith as a shield, an armor, and at the same time a weapon to destroy us.</t7815><t7816>We, his enemies, are ready to take risks for the peace of a beloved person, for humanity, for the honor and glory of God.</t7816>
<t7817>After a general conversation, we decided that this evening we would not worry about anything anymore, to relax our minds a bit before making the necessary conclusions.</t7817> <t7818>Tomorrow morning; we will meet again at breakfast, and after sharing our thoughts, we will all discuss the final action plan together.</t7818>
<t7819>This evening gives me a truly peaceful feeling, because the constant threat is no longer looming close to me.</t7819> <t7820>It could also be..</t7820><t7821>.</t7821>
<t7822>But I cannot say that my hope is complete, because when I stood in front of the mirror, I noticed the red mark still imprinted on my forehead.</t7822> <t7823>I understood that I was still a tainted person.</t7823>
<t7824>Dr. Seward's Diary</t7824>
<t7825>• October 5</t7825>
<t7826>We woke up very early after a deep and restful sleep.</t7826> <t7827>At breakfast, the whole group gathered together again, and everyone seemed more cheerful than usual.</t7827>
<t7828>The nature of humans is often to have very special sudden abilities.</t7828><t7829>If we have to remove a formidable obstacle in any way, - even through death, we will somehow find a reason to be happy and hopeful.</t7829><t7830>When sitting at the dining table, more than once I have widened my eyes, wondering if the events of the past days were real or just a dream.</t7830><t7831>I have to look at the red mark imprinted on Mina's forehead to return to reality.</t7831><t7832>Even now, when having to consider a very serious issue, I still can hardly acknowledge that the cause of all the misfortune continues to exist.</t7832><t7833>Mina Harker seems to be lost in her own thoughts for a long while.</t7833><t7834>Surely she cannot forget the stain on her forehead, as occasionally something happens to remind her of her memories.</t7834><t7835>We sat discussing the plan of action in my office for about half an hour.</t7835><t7836>I only recognized an immediate difficulty by instinct rather than reason: I suspected there was some mysterious cause blending into Mina's voice.</t7836><t7837>After what had happened, she could draw her own conclusions, but she did not want to, or could not, speak out, leaving me to guess.</t7837><t7838>I whispered to Van Helsing and arranged that when we were alone, the two of us would talk about her.</t7838><t7839>I suddenly imagined some kind of toxin had been introduced into her bloodstream and was beginning to take effect.</t7839><t7840>The old count had introduced something into her body that Van Helsing called "vampire blood infusion."</t7840><t7841>There you have it!</t7841><t7842>In this world, there could exist a toxin spread by strange circumstances.</t7842><t7843>But I only know one thing: if my instinctual feeling about the cause forcing Mina into repeated silence is not wrong, then the heavy task ahead presents us with a formidable difficulty, a vague danger that is not easily overcome.</t7843><t7844>The invisible power that forces her to be silent is the same as the one that forces her to speak.</t7844><t7845>However, I do not dare to think ahead of anything, for if I do so, I will lower the image of the gentle girl in my heart.</t7845>
<t7846>Van Helsing was the one who appeared in my office before the group.</t7846> <t7847>We will try to discuss this topic.</t7847>
<t7848>• A moment later</t7848>
<t7849>The professor walked in, and we immediately got into the conversation.</t7849> <t7850>I understood that he was preoccupied with something in his mind but wasn't ready to share it with me yet.</t7850> <t7851>After a while of talking about trivial matters, he suddenly said:</t7851>
<t7852>— John, my friend, here is what I want to discuss with you privately, at least at the beginning.</t7852> <t7853>After that, we will talk to the others...</t7853>
<t7854>He paused for a moment before continuing:</t7854>
<t7855>— Mina, our poor girl Mina is no longer herself.</t7855>
<t7856>I was stunned to hear him explain, even though I had vaguely understood something beforehand:</t7856>
<t7857>— The tragic life of Lucy reminds us that this time we should not let things go too far.</t7857> <t7858>Indeed, our task at this moment is more difficult and arduous than ever, and the new worry depends crucially on time.</t7858> <t7859>I began to notice the characteristics of a "vampire" on her face.</t7859> <t7860>It was all just fleeting, but clear enough if we observed objectively.</t7860> <t7861>Her two fangs had grown longer and her eyes occasionally appeared more wild.</t7861> <t7862>That's not all.</t7862> <t7863>Mina too often remained silent: all the signs were just like Lucy's case back then.</t7863> <t7864>She even went so far as to write down what she wanted to say to others.</t7864> <t7865>But now I fear this the most: if while being hypnotized, Mina can tell us what the count sees and hears, it also means that he - who hypnotized her first, then drank her blood and made her drink his - can force her to reveal everything she knows to him if he wishes.</t7865>
<t7866>I nodded in agreement.</t7866> <t7867>He continued:</t7867>
<t7868>— Therefore, to prevent this danger, we are forced to keep all our plans and intentions secret from her.</t7868> <t7869>It is a mandatory and difficult decision, so much so that I dare not even think about it in my heart.</t7869> <t7870>Later, when we are sitting together, I must tell Mina that for a reason we cannot disclose, she should not attend the meeting with us, but she will still be protected as usual.</t7870>
<t7871>He took a towel to wipe the sweat-drenched forehead, seemingly tormented by something terrible inside.</t7871> <t7872>I knew he would find some solace in me when he understood that I would come to the same conclusion as him and would soon break free from doubt to accept reality.</t7872> <t7873>I expressed my thoughts, and the result unfolded just as I had hoped.</t7873>
<t7874>It's time for the group meeting.</t7874> <t7875>Van Helsing went ahead to prepare for the important meeting and his difficult opening remarks.</t7875> <t7876>But I think perhaps he went before me also because he wanted to find a moment of silence to silently pray to God.</t7876>
<t7877>• A moment later</t7877>
<t7878>Van Helsing and I both breathed a sigh of relief right after the meeting began, because Mina had just asked Jonathan to inform us that she would not be joining the discussion with us, fearing that her presence might make the group uncomfortable on certain issues. Van Helsing looked at me as if a burden had been lifted.</t7878> <t7879>The whole group focused on discussing the plan of action.</t7879> <t7880>The professor briefly summarized the events:</t7880>
<t7881>— The Tsarine Catherine ship left the Thames River yesterday morning.</t7881> <t7882>If it travels at maximum speed, it will still take at least three weeks to reach Varna; by land, we can get there in just three days.</t7882> <t7883>To ensure absolute safety, we need to depart after the 17th, aiming to arrive in Varna one day before the ship docks to prepare some necessary tasks.</t7883> <t7884>Of course, we need to bring weapons, meaning everything necessary to combat evil, whether spiritual or physical.</t7884>
<t7885>Quincey Morris suddenly spoke up:</t7885>
<t7886>— I think that old wolf comes from a region with many wolves, and who knows, he might return there before we do.</t7886> <t7887>I suggest that each of us carry a hunting rifle, it wouldn't be excessive.</t7887> <t7888>I have reason to trust the hunting rifle when there are always such troublesome matters around.</t7888>
<t7889>— Alright, - Van Helsing said, - there will be a hunting rifle.</t7889> <t7890>Quincey is indeed a person of great insight, especially for hunts like this.</t7890> <t7891>Now then, we have nothing to do here anymore, and none of us know what Varna is like, so why not go there first? The time here will certainly feel as long as it would there.</t7891> <t7892>The time tonight and tomorrow morning is more than enough for us to prepare everything.</t7892> <t7893>If nothing happens, all four of us can set off immediately.</t7893>
<t7894>— Only four people? - Harker asked in surprise, his eyes moving from one person to another, looking skeptical.</t7894>
<t7895>— Of course.</t7895> <t7896>- The professor answered decisively.</t7896> <t7897>- You need to stay to take care of your young wife.</t7897>
<t7898>Harker was silent for a moment before continuing, his voice trembling:</t7898>
<t7899>— We will discuss this matter tomorrow morning.</t7899> <t7900>I want to consult Mina's opinion.</t7900>
<t7901>I thought it was time for Van Helsing to suggest that Harker not reveal our plan to Mina, but no, he remained silent as if there was nothing to worry about.</t7901> <t7902>I winked and pretended to cough as a reminder.</t7902> <t7903>But he responded by putting a finger to his lips, signaling not to say anything.</t7903>
<t7904>Jonathan Harker's Journal</t7904>
<t7905>• October 5, afternoon</t7905>
<t7906>After this morning's group meeting, I suddenly felt an unusual emptiness in my mind.</t7906> <t7907>The new developments have put me in a state where I can no longer think of anything positive.</t7907> <t7908>The decision not to let Mina participate in the group discussions made me ponder a lot.</t7908> <t7909>And when I could no longer discuss anything with her, I became confused and lacked clarity.</t7909> <t7910>The way everyone treated me just now also made me lose my sense of direction.</t7910> <t7911>Mina is sleeping, her face peaceful, carefree, and innocent like a child, her face radiating happiness.</t7911> <t7912>Thank God! At least she still gets to enjoy such moments of peace.</t7912>
<t7913>• A moment later</t7913>
<t7914>Everything is so strange! I quietly sat watching Mina's peaceful sleep, hoping that I could be like that too.</t7914> <t7915>The evening was approaching, replacing the faint twilight, and the silent atmosphere in the room seemed to deepen within me.</t7915> <t7916>Suddenly, Mina woke up and looked at me with such affectionate eyes.</t7916> <t7917>She said:</t7917>
<t7918>— Jonathan, I want you to promise me something on your honor.</t7918> <t7919>A promise that will bring me back to myself, but also in accordance with God's will, a promise that nothing can hinder, even if I don't need to kneel and beg you with bitter, sorrowful tears: Hurry up, I need to do this right now!</t7919>
<t7920>— Mina, - I replied - I can't promise you something like that immediately.</t7920> <t7921>Perhaps I don't even have the right to do so.</t7921>
<t7922>— But darling, it was you who wanted it this way, and not for your own sake.</t7922> <t7923>Go ask Dr. Van Helsing if what I'm saying makes sense.</t7923> <t7924>If he doesn't agree, then you can do as you wish, I will accept it.</t7924> <t7925>Moreover, if you agree, I will release you from your promise shortly.</t7925>
<t7926>— Then I promise! I said, making her face light up, even though I knew she would never have complete happiness as long as that cruel mark remained on her forehead.</t7926>
<t7927>She said immediately:</t7927>
<t7928>— Promise that you will not reveal any plans against the old count to me, not even a word, a hint, or a metaphor.</t7928> <t7929>Do not mention anything as long as this scar remains on my forehead.</t7929>
<t7930>She pointed to the mark of the holy wafer on her forehead, her expression very serious.</t7930> <t7931>I suddenly understood the gravity of her words and repeated, my voice equally serious:</t7931>
<t7932>— I promise you that!</t7932>
<t7933>But upon saying this, I suddenly felt as if a door had slammed shut between my spouse and me.</t7933>
<t7934>• Midnight, the same day</t7934>
<t7935>In the afternoon, Mina's cheerful and lively demeanor seemed to have made our entire group more courageous.</t7935> <t7936>Even I felt that the terrible burden that had been weighing on us for so long was lightening.</t7936> <t7937>We parted ways very early to return to our rooms to rest.</t7937> <t7938>At this moment, Mina is sleeping soundly like a child.</t7938> <t7939>Is it any wonder that she knows how to use sleep to somewhat forget the troubles in her heart?</t7939> <t7940>Her example this afternoon will surely help me a lot.</t7940> <t7941>Wishing you a peaceful night!</t7941>
<t7942>• October 5, morning</t7942>
<t7943>Another surprise.</t7943> <t7944>Mina woke me up very early and told me to go call Dr. Van Helsing.</t7944> <t7945>I thought she wanted to be hypnotized again, so I didn't ask any questions and ran straight to the professor's room.</t7945> <t7946>Clearly, he was preparing for a visit, as I saw him dressed very neatly.</t7946> <t7947>His door was not closed, so I thought he might have heard my door open.</t7947> <t7948>When I told him, he came right away.</t7948> <t7949>As he entered, he asked Mina if he could call the rest of our friends to join us.</t7949>
<t7950>— No, - She replied briefly - it's not necessary.</t7950> <t7951>You can tell them later.</t7951> <t7952>I must accompany you on your journey.</t7952>
<t7953>Like me, the professor startled and asked again after a moment of silence:</t7953>
<t7954>— But for what reason?</t7954>
<t7955>— You must let me come along.</t7955> <t7956>I will be safer when I am with you, and him too.</t7956>
<t7957>— But why, Mina? Taking care of and ensuring your safety, as you know, has always been our foremost duty.</t7957> <t7958>We are facing a danger in which you are the most vulnerable, after all the situations and events that have transpired...</t7958>
<t7959>He suddenly fell silent, looking very embarrassed.</t7959>
<t7960>She answered, pointing to her forehead:</t7960>
<t7961>— I know.</t7961> <t7962>And it is precisely because of this that I must go.</t7962> <t7963>I can tell you when the sun has just risen.</t7963> <t7964>Later, I won't be able to say anything anymore.</t7964> <t7965>I know that when the old count demands, I must obey.</t7965> <t7966>I also know that if he orders me to leave secretly, I will come to him with cunning and deceit, enough to create a change, even with Jonathan.</t7966>
<t7967>She turned to look at me, her eyes filled with deep sadness.</t7967> <t7968>I could only hold tightly the small hand of my beloved wife, unable to say anything.</t7968> <t7969>She continued, her eyes brimming with tears:</t7969>
<t7970>— You men are always brave and strong.</t7970> <t7971>You become even stronger when united, as you can challenge what threatens to crush the life of humanity.</t7971> <t7972>Moreover, I can also be useful to you, because when hypnotized, you can read from me things that even I do not know.</t7972>
<t7973>Van Helsing responded emotionally, his voice becoming serious:</t7973>
<t7974>— Mrs. Mina, you are always a devout person.</t7974> <t7975>Yes, we will invite you to join us, and together we will contribute our efforts to complete our difficult mission.</t7975>
<t7976>Mina didn't say anything more but sank deep into her thoughts in front of me.</t7976> <t7977>She sat still for a while and then slowly leaned back to continue her sound sleep.</t7977> <t7978>Even when I drew the curtains high, letting the sunlight flood the small room, she still couldn't wake up.</t7978> <t7979>Van Helsing waved his hand, signaling me to quietly go to his room.</t7979> <t7980>A few minutes later, both Lord Godalming, Morris, and Dr. Seward arrived.</t7980> <t7981>He recounted to them what Mina had just said and continued:</t7981>
<t7982>— They will go to Varna today.</t7982> <t7983>Mina makes a lot of sense, so we have been timely warned.</t7983> <t7984>We must not miss any opportunity, and upon reaching Varna, everyone must be ready to act the moment the ship docks.</t7984>
<t7985>— So what exactly do we have to do? - Morris asked briefly.</t7985>
<t7986>After a moment of thought, the professor replied:</t7986>
<t7987>— First of all, we need to board the ship.</t7987> <t7988>Then, right after identifying the location of the wooden chest, we must place a wild rose branch on it to prevent him from escaping.</t7988> <t7989>At least, that's what I know from the belief system.</t7989> <t7990>First of all, we need to believe in superstitions, as it is the foundation to bring us the initial confidence in this situation.</t7990> <t7991>After that, if we observe that no one is lurking around, we seize the opportunity to pry open the chest and... everything will go smoothly.</t7991>
<t7992>— As for me, I don't need to wait for any opportunity.</t7992> <t7993>- Morris spoke up.</t7993> <t7994>- As soon as I see the coffin, I'll pry the lid open and give the demon a blow to the head to finish it quickly.</t7994> <t7995>Let the people watch whatever they want, we'll deal with everything later!</t7995>
<t7996>I was moved as I tightly held the hand of the American man, his hand now as hard as steel.</t7996> <t7997>I hoped he would understand all the emotions in my eyes.</t7997>
<t7998>— Hooray for the young man! - Van Helsing exclaimed. - Hooray for the young man!</t7998> <t7999>Quincey is truly a one hundred percent man.</t7999> <t8000>May God bless you! But young man, please believe me, none of us are trained for this job, and there isn't much time left for us to be afraid.</t8000> <t8001>I'm just roughly saying what we can and must do, that's all.</t8001> <t8002>In reality, how do we know what we must do? There could be many things happening that we cannot foresee.</t8002> <t8003>There will be sudden twists, unforeseen outcomes.</t8003> <t8004>We can't predict anything, young man.</t8004> <t8005>However, we should equip ourselves fully, and when the decisive moment comes, all our efforts will be most effective.</t8005> <t8006>Now, let's prepare thoroughly.</t8006> <t8007>Let's arrange everything we find most necessary, because no one can predict what outcome will happen to us, when, and in what manner.</t8007> <t8008>As for myself, I am ready and have nothing left to do but organize the trip.</t8008> <t8009>I will get the tickets and everything needed for this expedition.</t8009>
<t8010>There was nothing left to discuss, so we immediately got to work on the preparations.</t8010> <t8011>I will arrange everything related to my land and property, and be ready to face whatever may come.</t8011>
<t8012>• A moment later</t8012>
<t8013>I have finished writing the will and prepared everything else.</t8013> <t8014>If Mina comes along, she will be my sole heir.</t8014> <t8015>If there were someone else, we would have been too happy.</t8015>
<t8016>The sunset gradually.</t8016> <t8017>Mina's gesture caught my attention.</t8017> <t8018>I am certain that right at the moment the sun sets, something ominous happens in her mind.</t8018> <t8019>Such moments are always a challenge for us, because each time the sun rises or sets, it opens up a new danger, a new endurance for the whole group.</t8019> <t8020>I write these lines in my diary, for at this moment, my dear wife can no longer comprehend anything.</t8020> <t8021>If later on, she can regain clarity like a normal person, then everything will be in the diary.</t8021>
<t8022>I suddenly started when I heard her call.</t8022>
<t8023>CHAPTER 25</t8023>
<t8024>Dr. Seward's Diary</t8024>
<t8025>• October 11, evening</t8025>
<t8026>Jonathan Harker suggested that I record the events that followed.</t8026> <t8027>He told me that it was not enough for him alone to keep a diary, and he wanted everything to be reflected as accurately as possible.</t8027>
<t8028>I think none of us were surprised when we were invited to Mina's side just before dusk.</t8028> <t8029>We had just learned that sunrise or sunset for her were moments of a strange liberation phenomenon, meaning her true self would manifest with some invisible dominant force either preventing her from acting, or conversely, compelling her to act.</t8029> <t8030>This state appears about half an hour before sunrise or sunset and lasts until the sun is high or clouds come to obscure the last rays lingering on the horizon.</t8030> <t8031>It is the beginning of a negative effect, like a knot being untied, very quickly followed by a state of absolute freedom.</t8031> <t8032>When that freedom is interrupted, the state will repeat very quickly with a brief forewarning phenomenon of her silence.</t8032>
<t8033>This afternoon, as we sat together, she seemed somewhat reluctant with clear signs of an internal struggle.</t8033> <t8034>I believe the cause of the tension was the tremendous effort required of her right from the moment she regained her freedom.</t8034> <t8035>However, just a few minutes were enough for her to completely regain control of herself.</t8035> <t8036>She pointed, signaling Jonathan to sit next to her on the couch where she was half-sitting, half-lying, and then asked everyone to move their chairs closer.</t8036> <t8037>She tightly held Harker's hand and said:</t8037>
<t8038>— This might be the last time we gather freely together.</t8038> <t8039>My love, I know you will always be with me until the end.</t8039>
<t8040>Looking at the small hands tightly holding her poor husband's hand, we knew she was very emotional.</t8040>
<t8041>— Tomorrow, - She continued - we will set out on our mission, and only heaven knows what kind of end that mission will have in store for us.</t8041> <t8042>Everyone is so kind to allow me to join.</t8042> <t8043>I know that all the brave things a man can do for an unfortunate woman who has lost her soul to the devil,... no, not quite like that, but almost, you will do.</t8043> <t8044>But please remember that I am not like everyone else.</t8044> <t8045>My soul, the blood flowing in me, have all been tainted.</t8045> <t8046>I might die because of that, at least in the case that you no longer need me.</t8046> <t8047>Just like me, you surely understand that my soul is teetering on the edge of an abyss.</t8047> <t8048>I know, now there is indeed a wide road open before me, but it is not your road...</t8048>
<t8049>She looked at all of us in turn, the first and the last person being Jonathan, her eyes seeming to question each one of us.</t8049>
<t8050>— Which road? - Van Helsing asked impatiently, his voice hoarse.</t8050>
<t8051>— Immediate death by one's own hand or the hand of another, before dying by the hand of the evil one.</t8051> <t8052>I know, and so do you, that if I die, you can and would very much want to free my immortal soul, just as you did for poor Lucy the other day.</t8052> <t8053>If the only concern was death itself or the fear of death, I would not hesitate before death, among those who always consider me their closest friend.</t8053> <t8054>But death is not everything.</t8054> <t8055>I do not believe that my death at this moment aligns with the will</t8055> <t8056>of God, while you still have an important mission to complete.</t8056> <t8057>But I am still moving towards this darkness, the darkness that I believe can dispel the dark things in this world and on this earth.</t8057>
<t8058>We sat in silence, listening, because everyone understood that this was just the prelude to unpleasant things.</t8058> <t8059>Everyone's face was pale, serious, and tense, while Jonathan's complexion was ashen like the color of dust.</t8059> <t8060>Perhaps he would understand what would happen next better than we did.</t8060> <t8061>Mina continued:</t8061>
<t8062>— That is precisely my contribution to this cruel life.</t8062> <t8063>Each of you will be able to contribute something. It is also your own life, I know.</t8063> <t8064>It is indeed not a difficult task for brave men.</t8064> <t8065>Your lives are given to you by God, so you can return them to Him in the most deserving way.</t8065> <t8066>But what will you give me?</t8066>
<t8067>I still recognized her questioning look, but this time that look was directed only at Jonathan.</t8067> <t8068>It seemed that Quincey understood the unfortunate girl's intention, as I saw him nodding sympathetically.</t8068> <t8069>His gesture made Mina's face brighten up.</t8069> <t8070>She said:</t8070>
<t8071>— Yes! I will say what I want to everyone.</t8071> <t8072>Friends, each of you must promise me that if the time comes, you must end my life to help me, including you, my dear husband.</t8072>
<t8073>— When? - Quincey asked, his voice trembling.</t8073>
<t8074>— At the hour when everyone sees the change in me and death becomes necessary for my life.</t8074> <t8075>When my body truly departs, everyone should not hesitate to drive a stake through my heart, or do something necessary like that, so that I may reach eternal death like any other ordinary person!</t8075>
<t8076>The room seemed like it would remain silent forever if Quincey hadn't been the first to stand up.</t8076> <t8077>He knelt down and took the small hands of the unfortunate woman, his face solemn:</t8077>
<t8078>— I am just a rough person, perhaps I do not live up to your esteem, but I can promise you with honor that when the time comes, I will not hesitate to do what you are expecting.</t8078>
<t8079>— Truly a real friend of mine! - Mina said through streaming tears and bent down to kiss her friend's hand.</t8079>
<t8080>— I assure you, Mina? - It was Van Helsing's turn to speak.</t8080>
<t8081>— Me too! - said Lord Godalming emotionally.</t8081> <t8082>- I also kneel and promise to you.</t8082>
<t8083>The last person was Jonathan.</t8083> <t8084>He turned to look at his beloved wife, his eyes vacant, his pale face appearing even more wan under his graying hair:</t8084>
<t8085>— And you, do you have to promise like that, my love?</t8085>
<t8086>— You must do the same, Jonathan. - She said, her eyes and voice filled with love - You must not falter.</t8086><t8087>You are the closest and dearest to me, you are my whole world.</t8087><t8088>Our souls have intertwined in this life to become immortal.</t8088><t8089>Think about it, my love, there have been times when brave men have killed their wives and women in their families to save them from the hands of the enemy.</t8089><t8090>The hands of those brave men did not tremble, because the ones they loved demanded them to do so.</t8090><t8091>It is the duty of men towards their loved ones in the face of brutal war.</t8091><t8092>So, my love, if I must die by someone's hand, it should be by the hand of the one I love the most.</t8092><t8093>Dr. Van Helsing, surely you have not forgotten the tragic moments of Lucy, have you? You witnessed a true feeling for the one she loved - she suddenly blushed, stammered, and corrected herself -... for the one who deserved to be entrusted with helping her find peace.</t8093><t8094>If such a moment comes to me, please encourage my husband to let me rest eternally by his hand.</t8094><t8095>I want his loving hand to help me remove the terrible burden I am carrying.</t8095>
<t8096>— Once again, I promise you! - Van Helsing said, his voice dropping significantly.</t8096>
<t8097>Mina smiled, yes, a genuine smile, and leaned back with a sigh of relief before continuing:</t8097>
<t8098>— And now, I would like to remind everyone of something that you must be vigilant about, never forget: that moment, if it happens, could come very quickly and unexpectedly.</t8098> <t8099>In this case, you should never waste time waiting for any other suitable opportunity.</t8099> <t8100>Because at that time, I might...</t8100> <t8101>Yes, if that moment occurs, I must join the enemy to fight against you.</t8101> <t8102>I beg you one more thing, - She said sternly - a plea less vital and less urgent, but a favor I ask of everyone if possible.</t8102>
<t8103>None of us said a word, because it was not necessary to do so now.</t8103>
<t8104>— I ask everyone to pray for my soul right now.</t8104>
<t8105>Jonathan suddenly hiccuped, causing his wife to be interrupted.</t8105> <t8106>She took his hand, placed it on her lap, and continued:</t8106>
<t8107>— There will come a day when you have to recite a prayer for my soul.</t8107> <t8108>No matter how this adventure ends, it is just a matter of faith.</t8108> <t8109>My dear husband, I hope it will be you who recites the prayer for my soul, that your beloved voice will be etched deeply in my eternal memory, no matter what kind of eternity it may be.</t8109>
<t8110>— But my dear, - Jonathan exclaimed - death is still far away from you.</t8110>
<t8111>— No! Now, I am just waiting to be laid out and buried at any moment.</t8111>
<t8112>— Oh, my little wife, do I really have to read it?</t8112>
<t8113>— Yes, that will give you more strength, my love.</t8113>
<t8114>Jonathan trembled as he looked at his wife holding out the Bible in front of him.</t8114>
<t8115>How can I... in a state of confusion, melancholy, fear, and pain, how can I describe this bitter, ironic life scene?</t8115> <t8116>My heart feels shattered seeing my friends kneeling beside the unfortunate girl, and a husband struggling to read simple prayers with a broken, fragmented voice amidst sobs.</t8116> <t8117>I cannot... each word, each letter cannot penetrate my mind.</t8117>
<t8118>The instinct of a human being had urged him to follow his wife's wishes.</t8118> <t8119>If his actions were unbelievable, then we would surely be the first ones to be surprised.</t8119> <t8120>But it seemed that the emotional scene before us had helped us regain our strength and determination.</t8120> <t8121>Mina's sudden silence indicated that her soul was once again being coerced...</t8121>
<t8122>Jonathan Harker's Diary</t8122>
<t8123>• Varna, October 15</t8123>
<t8124>We left Charing Cross on the morning of the 12th, arrived in Paris the same day, and boarded the Orient Express to continue our journey.</t8124> <t8125>The train traveled day and night, bringing us here at around five o'clock.</t8125> <t8126>As soon as we got off the station, Lord Godalming hurried to the Consulate to check if there were any telegrams for us, while the rest of us headed to the Odessus Hotel to book rooms.</t8126>
<t8127>The trip had a few hiccups, but because I was so anxious, I didn't have the heart to pay attention to trivial matters.</t8127> <t8128>From now until the Tsarine Catherine docks, nothing in this vast world will catch my attention. Thank God, Mina is still safe and seems to be getting healthier, her face a bit rosier.</t8128> <t8129>She sleeps a lot, sleeping through most of the journey.</t8129> <t8130>In contrast, just before dawn or dusk, she becomes wide awake and seems much more lively.</t8130> <t8131>Those are the times when Professor Van Helsing can perform hypnosis.</t8131> <t8132>At first, he encountered some difficulties, having to wave his hands many times, but now, it seems Mina complies immediately.</t8132> <t8133>At such times, it seems as though some power imposes itself on her, and his guiding thoughts compel her to follow.</t8133> <t8134>He asks her in various ways about what she can see and hear.</t8134> <t8135>And this time, she answered:</t8135>
<t8136>— I can't see anything.</t8136> <t8137>Everything is pitch dark.</t8137>
<t8138>Then:</t8138>
<t8139>— I heard the sound of waves lapping against the side of the boat and then dissipating.</t8139> <t8140>I saw them pulling ropes, the sails, the masts creaking, and even the mast base.</t8140> <t8141>The wind was blowing very strongly, I could hear the sound of the ropes cutting through the wind and the bow of the ship slicing through the waves.</t8141>
<t8142>It is clear that the ship Tsarine Catherine is still adrift at sea and heading towards Varna.</t8142> <t8143>Lord Godalming returned to us quite quickly, holding four telegrams that had been sent over several consecutive days since we set out.</t8143> <t8144>The telegrams only provided us with the same information.</t8144> <t8145>The Hoyd Company informed us of a few points that the Tsarine Catherine passed through.</t8145> <t8146>Before leaving London, the lord had prepared money and documents for a trustee so that he could send daily telegrams informing us of the places the ship had signaled to the mainland.</t8146>
<t8147>We had dinner and went to bed very early.</t8147> <t8148>Tomorrow, we have to meet the vice consul and then prepare some necessary tasks to be ready to act as soon as the ship docks.</t8148> <t8149>Our opportunity, as Van Helsing put it, will only be possible during the time between sunrise and sunset.</t8149> <t8150>Even if he takes the form of a bat, the count cannot traverse a long distance over the turbulent sea using his powers.</t8150> <t8151>Thus, he cannot leave the ship.</t8151> <t8152>If he wants to hide in human form without arousing suspicion - something he always wants to avoid - he must stay still in the wooden box.</t8152> <t8153>In short, we can board the ship after sunrise, and he will be within our reach, as we can open the box and take action, just like we did with Lucy, before he has a chance to wake up.</t8153> <t8154>Our pity for him is clearly not an obstacle.</t8154> <t8155>Thank God, corruption is rampant everywhere in this land, and we are not short of money.</t8155> <t8156>We just need to ensure that the ship docks between sunrise and sunset, and have prior notice.</t8156> <t8157>May God arrange everything satisfactorily!</t8157>
<t8158>• October 16</t8158>
<t8159>Mina still picked up similar signals during hypnosis: the sound of water lapping against the ship's hull, the bow cutting through the waves, the dark sky...</t8159>
<t8160>News about Tsarina Catherine still comes to us regularly.</t8160>
<t8161>• October 17</t8161>
<t8162>I think everything has been carefully prepared to welcome Count Dracula's return. The plan has been set: we will tell the sailors on the ship that the wooden box contains items stolen by a thief from a friend of ours, and Godalming will be responsible for obtaining permission to open the box for inspection.</t8162> <t8163>From London, the ship's owner gave him a handwritten letter addressed to the captain, requesting that he facilitate the full execution of his duties.</t8163> <t8164>The ship's owner also granted similar authority to an employee in Varna. We met this employee, and thanks to Godalming's noble demeanor, we easily persuaded him to assist us to the best of his ability.</t8164> <t8165>We also agreed on the measures to prepare for opening the box.</t8165> <t8166>If the Count is inside, Van Helsing and Seward will immediately behead him and drive a sharp stake through his heart.</t8166> <t8167>Quincey Morris, Godalming, and I will stand by to provide support and use any necessary weapons.</t8167> <t8168>The professor assured us that if we do this, the Count's entire body will instantly turn to dust.</t8168> <t8169>In that case, no one would have evidence to accuse us of murder.</t8169> <t8170>Even if the outcome does not go as planned, we are willing to face all consequences, and perhaps one day, this book will exonerate us from the gallows.</t8170> <t8171>As for myself, I still feel honored to take action if given the opportunity.</t8171> <t8172>We decided to stir heaven and earth to achieve success by any means necessary.</t8172> <t8173>Anyway, everything has been securely arranged, and now we just await a special message as soon as the ship Tsarine Catherine comes into our sight.</t8173>
<t8174>• October 24</t8174>
<t8175>A week of waiting has passed.</t8175> <t8176>The daily telegrams sent to Godalming always repeated one sentence: "Still no new information."</t8176> <t8177>Mina's response during each hypnosis session also remained unchanged: "The sound of waves crashing, the wind howling, the mast creaking..."</t8177>

<t8180>"This morning, the ship Tsarirle Catherine signaled at Dardanelles."</t8180>
<t8181>Dr. Seward's Diary</t8181>
<t8182>• October 24</t8182>
<t8183>I deeply regret not bringing the phonograph.</t8183> <t8184>There is truly nothing that makes me feel more miserable than having to write a diary with a pen, but Van Helsing insists that it must be written.</t8184> <t8185>This morning, we thought we might go mad when Lord Godalming received a telegram from Hoyd.</t8185> <t8186>Now I understand the kind of emotions warriors must endure when waiting for the signal to attack.</t8186> <t8187>Among us, only Mina shows no sign of anything, because we still try not to let her know anything and try not to let her notice everyone's impatience.</t8187> <t8188>In the past, I was sure she would have noticed the expressions on each person's face, but since three weeks ago, everything has changed.</t8188> <t8189>Many times she looks dazed like a lost soul, and although she seems healthier, Van Helsing and I are still not satisfied.</t8189> <t8190>We often talk about her but do not tell others, for fear that it might reach Jonathan and cause him more distress.</t8190> <t8191>During hypnosis, Van Helsing carefully examined her two sets of teeth and said that they haven't grown any longer, which means that currently there is no change indicating an imminent danger looming over us.</t8191> <t8192>If we notice any signs of instability, we must take preventive measures immediately.</t8192> <t8193>We understand what those measures are, even though no one speaks out their thoughts.</t8193> <t8194>No one among us will cowardly retreat from the task, even if it is the most terrifying one.</t8194> <t8195>“Peaceful death” is a wonderful phrase that gives us strength!</t8195>
<t8196>From the Dardanelles to here takes about twenty-four hours if you count the wind direction from London. Therefore, the Tsarine Catherine will only appear tomorrow morning.</t8196> <t8197>Knowing that the ship cannot arrive any earlier, we decided to go to bed early and wake up at one o'clock to prepare.</t8197>
<t8198>October 25, noon</t8198>
<t8199>There is still no new information about the ship's whereabouts.</t8199> <t8200>The information conveyed by Mina during her trance was no different, to the point that we could immediately understand the meaning in each of her words.</t8200> <t8201>We were all feverish with anticipation, except for Jonathan who remained calm as if nothing had happened.</t8201> <t8202>His hands were as cold as ice, he quietly went outside and diligently sharpened the sharp Kukri knife, after which he never let it out of his sight.</t8202> <t8203>It was indeed a dire prospect for the old count: that knife's blade would pierce straight into his neck with a swift and cold-blooded hand.</t8203>
<t8204>Today, both Van Helsing and I are worried about Mina.</t8204> <t8205>Near noon, she suddenly fell into a deep sleep.</t8205> <t8206>We felt sad but didn't say anything to the rest of our friends.</t8206> <t8207>In the morning, she was constantly busy with various unnamed tasks, sometimes even acting excessively.</t8207> <t8208>We were genuinely relieved when we saw her go back to her room to rest.</t8208> <t8209>However, when Jonathan informed us that she was sleeping so soundly that no amount of calling could wake her, we had to immediately check on her to see what was happening.</t8209> <t8210>She was still breathing naturally and seemingly steadily, so gently that we all thought that for her at this moment, nothing could be better than a deep sleep.</t8210> <t8211>Poor girl, will a long sleep help her forget everything?</t8211> <t8212>There is nothing surprising if the sleep is natural and suitable for her at this time.</t8212>
<t8213>• A moment later</t8213>
<t8214>Our feeling was completely accurate, because when Mina woke up after many hours of deep sleep, she was energetic and even healthier than she had been in days.</t8214> <t8215>At sunset, in a hypnotized state, she informed us that on the Black Sea, Count Dracula's ship was speeding towards its destination.</t8215> <t8216>Speeding towards the place of his judgment, yes, I know!</t8216>
<t8217>• October 26</t8217>
<t8218>It's strange that yet another day has passed without any news about Tsarine Catherine.</t8218> <t8219>By now, it should have returned.</t8219> <t8220>Surely, it must still be adrift somewhere, as during the dawn séance, Mina reiterated what she had said in previous days.</t8220> <t8221>Perhaps the ship is temporarily halted due to fog.</t8221> <t8222>The sailors on the steamships that just docked reported that yesterday at sea, both to the north and the south, there was a lot of fog.</t8222> <t8223>So, we have no choice but to continue waiting and watching, as the ship could appear at any moment.</t8223>
<t8224>• October 27, noon</t8224>
<t8225>Strange! There is still no new information about the ship.</t8225>
<t8226>Yesterday afternoon and this morning, Mina continued to say the usual things: "The waves slap against the side of the ship, the ship cuts through the water," and then: "the waves are very weak."</t8226> <t8227>Van Helsing seemed terribly worried, he said he thought the Count had slipped out of our grasp and emphasized:</t8227>
<t8228>— I don't like Mina's way of falling into a deep sleep.</t8228> <t8229>Her spirit and memory might cause some issues while being hypnotized.</t8229>
<t8230>I was about to ask a few more questions when he waved his hand repeatedly to signal silence, because Jonathan had just appeared.</t8230> <t8231>This evening, we will try to extract more information from her during hypnosis.</t8231>
<t8232>Telegram from Rufus Smith, Lloyd’s, London, to Lord Godalming, kindly forwarded by H. B. M's Vice Consul at Varna</t8232>
<t8233>October 28</t8233>
<t8234>The Tsarine Catherine ship signaled at the port entrance of Galatz at one o'clock today.</t8234>
<t8235>Dr. Seward's Diary</t8235>
<t8236>• October 28</t8236>
<t8237>When we received the telegram informing us that the ship was in Galatz, we were less shocked and more suspicious.</t8237> <t8238>We did not understand where and when this sudden change began to occur.</t8238> <t8239>We were waiting for some kind of surprise to happen.</t8239> <t8240>The ship's late delay forced us to believe that everything was happening differently from what we had planned.</t8240> <t8241>We could only tell ourselves that the ship might have changed its course.</t8241> <t8242>In reality, everything happened exactly as it should have, not as we had guessed it would.</t8242> <t8243>The sudden change caused each of us to react in our own way.</t8243> <t8244>Van Helsing raised his hands to the sky as if to explain something but couldn't say a word, after a moment he lowered his hands, his face still very calm.</t8244> <t8245>Lord Godalming sat down on the ground, his face pale, his breath broken.</t8245> <t8246>I was stunned, looking from one person to another.</t8246> <t8247>Quincey Morris jerked his belt tight; in this foreign land, I understood his action to mean: "we need to take action!" Meanwhile, Mina's face was as pale as a corpse, the scar on her forehead suddenly seemed to redden, and she clasped her hands as if praying.</t8247> <t8248>Jonathan laughed out loud, yes, a bitter, sarcastic laugh, tears streaming down as if he had lost all hope, but his hand still groped for the Kukri knife and gripped its handle with the mindset of someone harboring unresolved resentment.</t8248>
<t8249>— What time does the next train to Galatz leave, I wonder? - Van Helsing asked aloud.</t8249>
<t8250>— 6:30 AM tomorrow.</t8250>
<t8251>We were startled, because the person who answered was Mina.</t8251>
<t8252>— My God, how did you know? - Arthur asked.</t8252>
<t8253>— Perhaps you have forgotten, or maybe you don't know that I always have a fondness for traveling by train.</t8253> <t8254>When I was at home, I mean in Exeter, I had the habit of checking train schedules to help Jonathan with his work.</t8254> <t8255>It happened so often that I still haven't gotten rid of that habit now.</t8255> <t8256>Moreover, I also understand that if we are forced to go to Dracula's castle, we have to pass through Galatz or at least through Bucharest, which is why I have been paying close attention to the train schedules.</t8256> <t8257>But there's nothing to worry about, because tomorrow there is only one train departing at the time I just mentioned.</t8257>
<t8258>—</t8258> <t8259>She surprises us again! - Van Helsing whispered.</t8259>
<t8260>— So, can't we hire a private train? - Lord Godalming asked.</t8260>
<t8261>Van Helsing shook his head and replied:</t8261>
<t8262>— I'm afraid not.</t8262> <t8263>This country is not like England, nor is it like my country.</t8263> <t8264>And even if there were such a trip, we certainly couldn't get there before the regular train.</t8264> <t8265>Not to mention, we still have quite a lot to prepare.</t8265> <t8266>We need to take our time to think and arrange everything properly before we go.</t8266> <t8267>Arthur, my friend, perhaps you should go to the station, buy tickets, and arrange everything so that we can depart tomorrow morning.</t8267> <t8268>Jonathan, you need to go to the shipping agent to tell them to send a letter to the company's staff in Galatz, stating the reason to inspect the wooden box just as we planned in Varna.</t8268> <t8269>Quincey Morris, you should meet the Vice Consul and ask him to request a colleague in Galatz to scout ahead for us, so that when we reach the Danube we don't waste any more time.</t8269> <t8270>And John, you stay with Mina and me, we will consider everything.</t8270> <t8271>With me looking after Mina, there's nothing to worry about as evening falls.</t8271>
<t8272>— As for me, - She said cheerfully, her voice brimming with joy just like her old self - I will try to help everyone in every way I can, I will think and write as I used to.</t8272> <t8273>There is a very strange change happening within me, I no longer feel compelled as I have for so long.</t8273>
<t8274>The faces of the three young men suddenly lit up when they understood the meaning of Mina's words.</t8274> <t8275>But Van Helsing and I did not.</t8275> <t8276>The two of us exchanged looks full of emotion.</t8276> <t8277>However, at this moment, we couldn't discuss anything.</t8277>
<t8278>When the three men had gone their separate ways to carry out their tasks, Van Helsing suggested that Mina check the entire set of journal copies and get him the pages that described Jonathan's time in exile at Dracula's castle. The young woman greeted us and then went to work immediately.</t8278> <t8279>After she was out of sight, Van Helsing said to me:</t8279>
<t8280>— You have the same thoughts as I do.</t8280> <t8281>Then say it!</t8281>
<t8282>— There is something unusual happening, an expectation that makes me somewhat uneasy, because it might lead me to incorrect reasoning.</t8282>
<t8283>— That's right.</t8283> <t8284>So, do you know why I told her to go find the pile of diary copies?</t8284>
<t8285>— No, unless you told her to leave so you could have a chance to talk to me alone.</t8285>
<t8286>— That might be so, but only partially.</t8286> <t8287>I have something to tell you. John, it seems that I have realized a truly serious and terrifying danger.</t8287> <t8288>When Mina said those words, for some reason, a strange suggestion popped into my mind.</t8288> <t8289>Three days ago, while I was hypnotized, the Count entered her soul to read her thoughts, or more precisely, he summoned her soul to meet him in the wooden box on the ship Tsarine Catherine, at the time he was freed by dawn or dusk.</t8289> <t8290>Now he knows we are here.</t8290> <t8291>Because clearly she, who has the freedom to move around and see and hear things, always knows more than someone confined in a cramped box of earth like him.</t8291> <t8292>He is trying every way to escape our pursuit.</t8292> <t8293>He doesn't need her immediately because he believes that sooner or later she will come to him at his call.</t8293> <t8294>He cut off contact with her, withdrew his power over her so that temporarily she is no longer under his possession.</t8294> <t8295>That, yes, that explains why I hope the mind long belonging to humanity of our men is far superior to the childish mind of him, someone who for centuries has only known to hide in tombs and is incapable of reaching our level now, someone who is limited by selfish and petty desires.</t8295> <t8296>Mina is here.</t8296> <t8297>Don't mention anything related to her trance state! We need her to be hopeful, courageous, with a mind that can match that of a man, but still bearing the attributes of a gentle and talented woman, and with a strength that the Count has imparted to her but cannot immediately reclaim, even if he imagines he has done so.</t8297> <t8298>Shh?</t8298> <t8299>Just stay silent and listen to me, then you will understand.</t8299> <t8300>John, we are indeed hitting a dead end as dark as pitch! I am more scared than I have ever been.</t8300> <t8301>We can only trust in God. Don't say anything more, she's coming.</t8301>
<t8302>I thought Van Helsing was about to collapse from nervous tension like the time he witnessed Lucy's death, but he still tried very hard to show that he was truly capable and completely in control of himself when Mina cheerfully walked in.</t8302> <t8303>The busy work that the professor had just assigned seemed to have made her forget the misfortune in her heart.</t8303> <t8304>She immediately handed a stack of papers to Van Helsing.</t8304> <t8305>The old professor carefully reviewed each sheet one by one, his face lighting up with the neatly typed letters.</t8305> <t8306>Then he pinched the stack of papers between his index finger and thumb:</t8306>
<t8307>— John, you have a lot of experience, and so do you, Mina.</t8307> <t8308>I would like to present a lesson for all of us: never be afraid of thinking too much.</t8308> <t8309>Occasionally, a half-formed thought flutters in my mind like a winged creature, but in the past, I was very afraid of letting it break its wings.</t8309> <t8310>Now, with more experience, I know I have to trace back to the starting point of every half-formed thought, and I discover that it is something entirely different, a real thought, even though it is too nascent to have small wings.</t8310> <t8311>Yes, it is like the ugly duckling of my friend Hans Andersen, but it is not a complete thought-duck, but a thought-swan that glides gracefully on the lake's surface with its large wings when given the chance to try.</t8311> <t8312>I will read to you a passage written by Jonathan: "... to what belongs to the descendants of the old man who later, once again, forced the armies to cross the river to invade Turkey? The truce-breaker continued to attack repeatedly and left behind a battlefield with bodies lying everywhere, because he knew that in the end, only he would be victorious?" What do we learn from this? Is there nothing important?</t8312> <t8313>No! The childish mind of the old count does not understand anything significant, which is why he speaks so recklessly.</t8313> <t8314>No!</t8314> <t8315>But this is another answer from someone who speaks without thinking because they do not know what it means or what it could mean.</t8315> <t8316>Yes, let me explain.</t8316> <t8317>But have you studied the philosophy of crime? Yes and no.</t8317> <t8318>My friend John, yes, because this subject is an indispensable part of studying mental illness.</t8318> <t8319>As for Mina, no, because crime has nothing to do with her, except once.</t8319> <t8320>But her mind always follows a straight path and has its own way of reasoning about the world.</t8320> <t8321>In humans, criminals have a stable characteristic, everywhere and at all times, so much so that even police officers who do not know much about philosophy can affirm it based on experience.</t8321> <t8322>Criminals often pursue a single crime, at least for those who do not plan their crimes in advance and do not pursue anything else.</t8322> <t8323>The criminal does not have a fully adult mind.</t8323> <t8324>He is alert, cunning, and full of strength.</t8324> <t8325>But when it comes to the mind, his development is not yet complete.</t8325> <t8326>In many respects, he is still in a developmental stage of a child.</t8326> <t8327>In other words, our criminal commits crimes due to predestination, his mind is still naive because what he does is just child's play.</t8327> <t8328>Young birds, fry, and small animals are not raised according to principles, but only based on experience.</t8328> <t8329>And what they learn will propel them to continue doing what they have done in a rut.</t8329> <t8330>Archimedes once said: give me a fulcrum, and I will lift the earth.</t8330> <t8331>The first attempt is the fulcrum by which a child's brain develops into an adult, and when it tries again, it starts to do what it has done before.</t8331> <t8332>Dear Mina, I see your eyes are wide open and the sunlight is illuminating the entire realm for you?</t8332>
<t8333>Indeed, Mina was waving her hands frantically, her eyes sparkling brightly.</t8333> <t8334>Van Helsing continued:</t8334>
<t8335>— Now, please speak, tell us what you see in those sparkling eyes.</t8335>
<t8336>He gently placed his thumb and index finger on the girl's wrist to check her pulse, a gesture that seemed unconscious and instinctive for a physician.</t8336>
<t8337>— The old count is a typical criminal - She began to speak - Nordau and Lombroso's theories classify him as such, and due to his crimes, his mind has never fully developed.</t8337> <t8338>Therefore, when faced with difficulties, he will seek to solve the problem in a habitual way.</t8338> <t8339>The origin of his only way of behaving belongs to his own past.</t8339> <t8340>The only page we know - and also as he himself has said - about him is that in an unfortunate time, he returned to his homeland after an attempt to invade another land.</t8340> <t8341>At home, he did not give up his goal and always harbored the intention of preparing to attack the foreign land once again.</t8341> <t8342>Indeed, he invaded again, better equipped, and achieved victory.</t8342> <t8343>Similarly, he came to London to conquer a new land.</t8343> <t8344>He won, but when all hope suddenly vanished, and his presence was placed in a dangerous situation, he immediately sought a way to the sea to return home, just as he had once done when crossing the Danube to invade Turkey.</t8344>
<t8345>— Excellent, excellent, truly unexpected.</t8345> <t8346>Mina, you are incredibly intelligent.</t8346> <t8347>- Van Helsing exclaimed in admiration and bent down to kiss her hand.</t8347>
<t8348>Then the professor fell silent as if examining a patient. After a moment of silence, he turned to me and said:</t8348>
<t8349>— Seventy-two beats, no more, and it seems very excited! I am very hopeful.</t8349>
<t8350>Then he turned back and urged Mina, looking impatient:</t8350>
<t8351>— Mina, continue, continue.</t8351> <t8352>You can speak freely if you want.</t8352> <t8353>There's nothing to be afraid of.</t8353>
<t8354>— I will try, but please don't mind if I only talk about myself.</t8354>
<t8355>— No, don't worry about anything.</t8355> <t8356>You should talk about yourself, because you are the one we are thinking about.</t8356>
<t8357>— Here’s the thing, from the perspective of a criminal, he is indeed a very selfish person. When intelligence is limited and actions are solely based on selfishness, he temporarily settled for a single goal and showed no remorse.</t8357> <t8358>Even when he crossed the Danube again to attack Turkey once more, causing countless of his soldiers to die on the battlefield, up until his recent defeat, he only thought about how to escape and did not consider anything else.</t8358> <t8359>It is precisely this selfishness that has somewhat freed my soul from the terrible power he cast upon me that night. Thank God, at this moment, my soul is indeed freer.</t8359> <t8360>There is only one worry that haunts me: I wonder if, while hiding and seeking refuge, he tried to extract information from me while I was hypnotized?</t8360>
<t8361>— Yes, he did.</t8361> <t8362>- Van Helsing replied. - That is why he abandoned us here, in this land of Varna, while the ship - shrouded in the fog he created - takes him to Galatz.</t8362> <t8363>Surely, when he gets there, he will have prepared everything to escape our pursuit.</t8363> <t8364>But his childish mind does not go beyond that.</t8364> <t8365>He could not foresee that what he considered an absolute advantage would become his greatest misfortune.</t8365> <t8366>And as the great Psalmist said, the hunter may have already set the snare.</t8366> <t8367>Indeed, at this moment, he thinks he has escaped our grasp and is hours ahead of us.</t8367> <t8368>His childish mind tells him that he can rest.</t8368> <t8369>Moreover, he believes that by severing the spiritual connection between him and her, she knows nothing about him.</t8369> <t8370>Thus, he has made another mistake.</t8370> <t8371>He has infused his cursed blood into her, binding her, though she can move freely, to always think of him as she did at sunrise and sunset.</t8371> <t8372>But fortunately, at such times, she follows my guidance and not his.</t8372> <t8373>This gift becomes even more precious as he is unaware of it and mistakenly believes he has severed the connection through us via her.</t8373> <t8374>On the contrary, we are not selfish and we believe that God will guide everyone through this dark moment.</t8374> <t8375>We will hunt down the demon, even at the risk of becoming like him.</t8375> <t8376>My friend John, this is a momentous, extremely important time for us.</t8376> <t8377>Do the work of a clerk and record everything that has just happened, so that when our friends return, you can easily recount to them what we have learned.</t8377>
<t8378>While waiting for some friends to return, I am writing these lines to recount the events that have occurred since Mina took her husband's diary and gave it to Van Helsing. Afterward, I will ask her to type it up again.</t8378>
<t8379>CHAPTER 26</t8379>
<t8380>Dr. Seward's Diary</t8380>
<t8381>• October 29</t8381>
<t8382>I am writing these lines on the train from Varna to Galatz.</t8382> <t8383>Yesterday afternoon, just before sunset, we gathered together once again.</t8383> <t8384>Everyone had completed their tasks in the best possible way.</t8384> <t8385>Reflection, boldness, and timing will help us prepare well for a long journey, even to Dracula's castle. As usual, Mina continued to prepare for a new hypnosis session.</t8385> <t8386>Van Helsing took quite a bit of time to put her into a trance state.</t8386> <t8387>Generally, she starts speaking from the first signs of the trance, but the professor had to ask quite a lot and very precisely before understanding the issue.</t8387> <t8388>Finally, Mina answered something like this:</t8388>
<t8389>— I can't distinguish anything at all.</t8389> <t8390>We are standing still in one place.</t8390> <t8391>It's not the sound of waves crashing, but a continuous whirlpool gently swirling around the rope.</t8391> <t8392>I hear the calls of the men, sometimes near, sometimes far, then the creaking of the oars.</t8392> <t8393>Somewhere, a sound of an explosion echoes from very far away.</t8393> <t8394>The sound of footsteps echoes above my head, along with the sound of ropes and chains being pulled.</t8394> <t8395>What is that?</t8395> <t8396>There is a streak of light.</t8396> <t8397>I feel a breeze just passed by.</t8397>
<t8398>She said nothing more, but suddenly sat up from the couch as if she had been pushed unexpectedly, with both hands raised, palms facing up as if she were holding something very heavy.</t8398> <t8399>Van Helsing and I exchanged glances, for we understood what was happening.</t8399> <t8400>Quincey frowned in observation, while Jonathan Harker, instinctively, reached for his Kukri knife.</t8400> <t8401>Everyone remained silent for a long time.</t8401> <t8402>We all knew that saying anything now would be useless.</t8402> <t8403>Mina suddenly stood up, her eyes wide open, and softly asked:</t8403>
<t8404>— Does anyone want to have a cup of tea?</t8404> <t8405>Everyone must be very tired!</t8405>
<t8406>We could only nod.</t8406> <t8407>After she went into the inner room to get tea and came back out, Van Helsing finally spoke:</t8407>
<t8408>— Friends, surely everyone understands by now.</t8408> <t8409>He is near a coast and has emerged from his box of earth.</t8409> <t8410>He needs to get ashore.</t8410> <t8411>In the evening, he can hide anywhere.</t8411> <t8412>But if he is not brought ashore or if the ship cannot dock, he will not be able to get ashore in the usual way.</t8412> <t8413>In such circumstances, when night falls, he can change form to jump or fly ashore as he did in Whitby in the guise of a dog.</t8413> <t8414>But if the sun rises before the ship docks, he can only remain in his wooden box.</t8414> <t8415>If he stays in there, he will surely be discovered by customs.</t8415> <t8416>In short, if he does not manage to get ashore tonight, specifically before dawn, he will lose an entire day and thus, we can arrive in time.</t8416> <t8417>Because if he cannot escape at night, we will meet him during the day, when he is still trapped in the box and his fate depends on us.</t8417> <t8418>He will not dare to reveal himself in his true form for fear of being discovered.</t8418>
<t8419>There was nothing more to say.</t8419> <t8420>We anxiously awaited dawn, when Mina Harker could tell us some additional details.</t8420> <t8421>At the break of day, in a state of restless anxiety, we gathered again to hear her speak as Van Helsing hypnotized her.</t8421> <t8422>This time, the professor had a hard time putting her into a trance.</t8422> <t8423>Finally, Mina had to comply with his instructions:</t8423>
<t8424>— Everything is pitch dark.</t8424> <t8425>I hear the sound of waves crashing and then the clattering of wood against wood.</t8425>
<t8426>She didn't say anything more, and moreover, the sun had just appeared, shining brightly.</t8426> <t8427>We'll have to wait until the afternoon then.</t8427>
<t8428>We arrived in Galatz in such a state of anxiety and impatience.</t8428> <t8429>We were supposed to get there around two or three in the morning.</t8429> <t8430>But from Bucharest, we departed three hours late, so we would certainly arrive after sunrise.</t8430> <t8431>One of Mina's two hypnotic messages, or both, might shed some light on the events that are unfolding.</t8431>
<t8432>• A moment later</t8432>
<t8433>Another sunset, fortunately occurring at a time when we were not disturbed by anything.</t8433> <t8434>If the sunset had coincided with the train stopping at a station, we certainly wouldn't have had the peace to hypnotize Mina: this time it was much harder for her to enter a trance compared to the last time.</t8434> <t8435>I fear the ability to decode the Count's sensations within her will vanish just when we need it the most.</t8435> <t8436>So far, her abilities have been limited to the simplest matters, and if this continues, she might lead us to a mistake.</t8436> <t8437>If I think the power the Count imposed on her is diminishing in tandem with her ability to see through issues, then I have no reason not to be happy.</t8437> <t8438>But honestly, I still doubt the situation she is experiencing.</t8438> <t8439>In the end, she only decoded it this simply:</t8439>
<t8440>— Something just disappeared.</t8440> <t8441>I felt a cold breeze pass by.</t8441> <t8442>There were faint sounds coming from afar, it seemed like some people were speaking a foreign language, there was also the sound of a very strong current and the mournful howling of wolves.</t8442>
<t8443>She suddenly stopped, shivered for a moment, and then her whole body began to shake violently as if having a seizure.</t8443> <t8444>She did not answer Van Helsing's questions.</t8444> <t8445>When she regained consciousness, she looked exhausted, drained, her body cold as ice, but fortunately, she still had control over herself.</t8445> <t8446>She said she didn't remember anything and wanted to know what she had just discovered.</t8446> <t8447>When she understood the issue, she sat silently and thought for a long time.</t8447>
<t8448>• October 30, 7 AM</t8448>
<t8449>We are approaching Galatz, and soon, I may not have time to write anymore.</t8449> <t8450>All of us are awake, waiting for dawn.</t8450> <t8451>Knowing that it is becoming increasingly difficult to hypnotize Mina, Van Helsing began his hand movements earlier than usual.</t8451> <t8452>Only about a minute before sunrise did Mina finally enter a trance.</t8452> <t8453>Not wasting any time on trivial matters, the professor immediately proceeded to the most essential questions.</t8453> <t8454>She also answered very quickly:</t8454>
<t8455>— It's all pitch dark.</t8455> <t8456>I hear the sound of swirling water at ear level, the clattering of wood against wood.</t8456> <t8457>Lower down is the sound of animals crying from afar.</t8457> <t8458>And another sound, strange... I must say...</t8458>
<t8459>She suddenly fell silent, her face growing increasingly pale.</t8459>
<t8460>— What else, what other sound?</t8460> <t8461>Continue, I order you to continue! - Van Helsing urged, his voice sounding truly earnest and imploring, his face showing clear signs of disappointment, as outside the sun had risen brightly, casting a red glow on Mina's pale complexion.</t8461>
<t8462>She opened her eyes wide, trembling slightly as she spoke to us, her face unable to hide her worry:</t8462>
<t8463>— Professor, why do you ask me things that you know very well I cannot answer?</t8463> <t8464>I don't remember anything!</t8464>
<t8465>She turned to look at our still clearly bewildered faces and continued:</t8465>
<t8466>— What have I already said?</t8466> <t8467>What have I already done?</t8467> <t8468>I don't know anything anymore, except that I am lying here half-awake, half-asleep, and I hear someone saying: "What else?</t8468> <t8469>Keep talking, I order you to keep talking!" Everyone talks as if they think I'm a guilty child!</t8469>
<t8470>— But Mina, - the Professor replied, with a sad tone - that is precisely a proof, if I may say so, of the friendship I have for you.</t8470> <t8471>In fact, I have never spoken more seriously, in a very difficult situation, I hope you won't mind.</t8471>
<t8472>A sudden whistle blared mournfully.</t8472> <t8473>So we have arrived at Galatz.</t8473> <t8474>We were on pins and needles with worry and impatience.</t8474>
<t8475>Mina Harker's Diary</t8475>
<t8476>• October 30</t8476>
<t8477>Quincey Morris led me to a hotel that he had booked in advance by telegram.</t8477> <t8478>This is a very pleasant hotel, at least because here people do not speak any foreign languages.</t8478> <t8479>Just like in Varna, Lord Godalming had to meet the Vice Consul to receive the safety guarantees provided for us, even in the most urgent situations.</t8479> <t8480>Jonathan and the two doctors went to the shipping agency to see if there was any news about the ship Tsarine Catherine.</t8480>
<t8481>• A moment later</t8481>
<t8482>Lord Godalming has just returned. The Consul General is away, while the Deputy is ill.</t8482> <t8483>However, everything was resolved quickly thanks to an authorized staff member who was very pleasant and dedicated to their duties.</t8483>
<t8484>Jonathan Harker's Journal</t8484>
<t8485>• October 30</t8485>
<t8486>It was 9 o'clock in the morning.</t8486> <t8487>Dr. Van Helsing, Dr. Seward, and I went to Mackenzie's house in Steinkoff, the agent of the Hapgood maritime company in London. Mentioning Lord Godalming, they immediately informed us that they had received his request for assistance and promptly led us to the Tsarine Catherine ship, which was anchored at a river port.</t8487> <t8488>We met the captain named Donelson, who recounted the entire journey of the ship to us.</t8488> <t8489>He said that in his entire life, he had never encountered such a horrific and bizarre voyage.</t8489>
<t8490>— The trip terrified us because we thought we would have to pay the price for our efforts to steer the ship back on its correct course.</t8490> <t8491>Drifting in the Black Sea is no joke.</t8491> <t8492>It seemed as if some demon had blown the wind to direct the sails and take the ship where it wanted.</t8492> <t8493>There was no way to know what was real and what was not.</t8493> <t8494>Every time we tried to approach another ship, or a port, or a headland, a thick fog would suddenly descend from nowhere and follow the ship along its journey, which was truly terrifying.</t8494> <t8495>Only when we neared this region did that bizarre hellish scene finally let us go.</t8495> <t8496>We passed Gibraltar without being able to signal the mainland.</t8496> <t8497>Then, when we reached the Dardanelles, we were supposed to dock to present our papers before continuing, but the ship kept moving forward without any authority questioning us.</t8497> <t8498>At first, I intended to reduce the air pressure and let the ship sail against the wind until the fog completely cleared, but then I gave up, thinking that if the demon had decided the ship must go full speed into the Black Sea, it would do so regardless of our wishes.</t8498> <t8499>And the demon must have been satisfied without being annoyed by our resistance.</t8499>
<t8500>The mixed temperament of honesty, humor, but also a certain cunning and superstitious nature typical of a merchant in the captain seemed to further intrigue Van Helsing.</t8500> <t8501>He said:</t8501>
<t8502>— My friend, sometimes demons are even bolder than what some people think of them, and they are fully aware of who they are facing.</t8502>
<t8503>The professor's suggestive joke did not excite the captain.</t8503>
<t8504>— After leaving the Bosphorus, - the captain continued - the passengers began to grumble.</t8504><t8505>Some Romanians came to me and demanded that we throw overboard a rather large wooden chest sent by a strange old man since we left London. At that time, I saw them glance at the old man and quickly raise two fingers as if to ward off something very unlucky when they saw him approaching.</t8505><t8506>Indeed, the beliefs of foreigners can sometimes be quite strange!</t8506><t8507>I had to shoo them away several times.</t8507><t8508>But right after that, a fog suddenly descended upon the ship from who knows where, making me wonder if those Romanians were right, even though I saw no reason to be prejudiced against that wooden chest.</t8508><t8509>Regardless, we continued our journey.</t8509><t8510>The fog enveloped the ship for five days straight.</t8510><t8511>I left the navigation to the winds, because if the devil wanted the ship to reach a certain place, we had no choice but to let it be, we couldn't do otherwise anyway!</t8511><t8512>Then the ship kept moving forward, very safely and without any collisions at all.</t8512><t8513>The day before yesterday, when the sun rose and pierced through the detestable fog, I suddenly realized the ship had reached a river, opposite Galatz.</t8513><t8514>The Romanians once again went mad, demanding to immediately throw the wooden chest into the river.</t8514><t8515>I had to talk to them with sticks, and when the last one jumped off the deck holding his head, I persuaded them that no matter how unlucky it was, I still placed the passengers' property and trust above all.</t8515><t8516>It should be noted that before that, these Romanian fellows had already dragged that damned chest onto the deck to prepare to throw it into the water.</t8516><t8517>I intended to throw it overboard when we unloaded at the port.</t8517><t8518>But in the morning, about an hour before sunrise, a man suddenly appeared and climbed aboard with an authorization letter from England to receive a chest addressed to Count Dracula. All his papers were in order, so there was no reason not to hand him the chest, moreover, I was beginning to feel uneasy about that cursed thing.</t8518><t8519>If the devil sent luggage onto my ship, it must be that wooden chest and nothing else!</t8519>
<t8520>— What is the name of the person coming to pick up the goods? - Van Helsing asked impatiently.</t8520>
<t8521>— I will tell you right away...</t8521>
<t8522>The captain stepped down to the cabin to get a receipt signed by Emmanue!</t8522> <t8523>Hildesheim, number 16, Burgenstrasse.</t8523>
<t8524>Knowing that we couldn't get any more information from the captain, we thanked him and continued on our way.</t8524>
<t8525>We met Hildesheim in his office.</t8525> <t8526>He was a Jew with a face as red as a fighting cock.</t8526> <t8527>Without any difficulty regarding our request, he immediately recounted everything he knew.</t8527> <t8528>He said he had received a letter sent from London by Sir De Vilie, in which he was asked to receive - if possible before sunrise to avoid the scrutiny of customs - a wooden crate sent by the ship Tsarine Catherine to the port of Galatz; after that, he was to hand the crate over to a certain Petrof Skinsky.</t8528> <t8529>This was a person associated with the Slovakians who specialized in river trading.</t8529> <t8530>He was paid with a British banknote and had it converted to gold by the Danube International Bank.</t8530> <t8531>He took Skinsky to the ship and delivered the goods there to avoid paying delivery fees.</t8531> <t8532>That was all, he couldn't say anything more.</t8532>
<t8533>So we had no choice but to look for someone named Skinsky, but in the end, we couldn't find him.</t8533> <t8534>A neighbor of his said that he had left the day before yesterday, but didn't know where he went.</t8534> <t8535>The landlord also told us that he had asked a postman to return the room key and the rent to him.</t8535> <t8536>This happened between ten and twelve o'clock last night.</t8536> <t8537>So we are hitting a dead end.</t8537>
<t8538>We were talking with the innkeeper when suddenly a man burst in, breathless and frantic, shouting that they had just found Skinsky's body in the Saint Pierre cemetery, with his neck torn open by the fang marks of some wild beast.</t8538> <t8539>Everyone who was talking to us immediately jumped up and rushed out to see the horrifying scene they had just heard about, while some women shouted after them: "It was a Slovak who did it!" We suddenly felt weak with fear, worried that we might get involved in the incident and ruin all our plans.</t8539>
<t8540>Returning to the hotel, we couldn't come up with a precise conclusion.</t8540> <t8541>Everyone could only think that perhaps the chest continued to be transported by water, but to where? This was a difficult question that we had to answer.</t8541> <t8542>We met Mina again in a state of heavy anxiety.</t8542> <t8543>During our meeting, we raised the issue of hypnotizing her once more.</t8543> <t8544>This might be our last chance.</t8544> <t8545>So precarious!</t8545>
<t8546>Mina Harker's Diary</t8546>
<t8547>• October 30, in the afternoon</t8547>
<t8548>They look so tired and discouraged! At this rate, no one will be able to do anything without taking a little rest.</t8548> <t8549>Therefore, I had to urge them to lie down for about half an hour, during which time I will record everything that has happened so far.</t8549> <t8550>I am truly grateful to whoever invented the portable typewriter and to Quincey Morris, who took the trouble to bring it here for me! Surely, I would lose my train of thought if I had to keep sharpening my pen on the paper...</t8550>
<t8551>It's all over.</t8551> <t8552>Jonathan was lying sprawled on the couch, his entire body limp and motionless like a paralyzed person, his face wrinkled with boredom.</t8552> <t8553>He must be thinking very hard.</t8553> <t8554>I wish I could help him! I will try to do what I can.</t8554>
<t8555>At my suggestion, Dr. Van Helsing handed over to me all the records that I had not yet seen.</t8555> <t8556>While he is on vacation, I plan to thoroughly read through everything and, if possible, draw some conclusions.</t8556> <t8557>I strive to follow the professor's example and think objectively about the events laid out before me.</t8557> <t8558>I believe I will make a real discovery after carefully considering and observing the local maps.</t8558>
<t8559>Yes, I increasingly feel that I am not mistaken.</t8559> <t8560>I will gather my friends and tell them my thoughts.</t8560> <t8561>They will judge my solution.</t8561> <t8562>Everything must be precise.</t8562> <t8563>Every minute that passes is very precious.</t8563>
<t8564>Summary of the review in Mina Harker's journal</t8564>
<t8565>Starting point of the investigation.</t8565> <t8566>Issue: Count Dracula is on his way home.</t8566>
<t8567>Surely someone must have brought him back.</t8567> <t8568>That is obvious, because if he had the power to move at will, he would have done so in the true guise of a human, a wolf, a bat, or any other form.</t8568> <t8569>Clearly, he is feeling suspicious that he might be exposed or troubled in his currently vulnerable state, confined in a box of earth during sunrise and sunset.</t8569> <t8570>How could he be transported?</t8570> <t8571>Let's use the following process of elimination:</t8571>
<t8572>1.</t8572> <t8573>By road.</t8573> <t8574>This will cause countless difficulties for him, especially when leaving the cities.</t8574>
<t8575>a) Encountering many people.</t8575> <t8576>The public will be curious and try to pry.</t8576> <t8577>A sign, a suspicion about what is hidden in the chest, and then he would be done for.</t8577>
<t8578>b) May or will certainly encounter customs or tax officials.</t8578>
<t8579>c) The pursuers chasing him could track his trail.</t8579> <t8580>That was his greatest fear, and it was precisely to avoid being exposed that he tried every possible way to run as far as he could, even from his victim - which was me!</t8580>
<t8581>2.</t8581> <t8582>By railway.</t8582> <t8583>If using this type of transportation, there would be no one to look after the wooden chest, which always has the risk of being delayed, and such a delay would be a fatal opportunity for the enemy to track him down.</t8583> <t8584>Of course, he could escape in the dark of night, but what would happen if he were thrown into an unfamiliar place with no suitable hiding spots?</t8584> <t8585>That was not his intention, nor was it a risk he could accept to take.</t8585>
<t8586>3.</t8586> <t8587>By waterway.</t8587> <t8588>On one hand, it is the most reliable means, but on the other hand, it is also the most dangerous.</t8588> <t8589>On the water, he has no power, except during the night.</t8589> <t8590>At the same time, he can only command his fog, storms, ice, and pack of wolves.</t8590> <t8591>And if the ship sinks, he will be submerged by the sea god without being able to do anything, thus adding another possibility of failure.</t8591> <t8592>If he is on a ship, then of course we must determine which waters the ship is drifting in.</t8592>
<t8593>The first goal of ours is to accurately determine what he has done so far, which will show us what needs to be done next.</t8593> <t8594>First of all, we will consider his actions in London as part of his entire plan, while he must be in a hurry every minute and wants to escape immediately.</t8594> <t8595>Then, we will try to infer what he did there with the events that we already know.</t8595>
<t8596>To begin with, it is obvious that he intended to go to Galatz.</t8596> <t8597>For us, the order concerning Varna was derailed if we understood that he had left England and we had to strive to determine his actual destination.</t8597> <t8598>His sole immediate purpose was to find a way to escape our pursuit: The main evidence is the instructions recorded in the letter to Emmanuel Hildesheim, to receive and unload the box before sunrise, as well as the instructions for Petrof Skinsky.</t8598> <t8599>At this point, we could only make guesses.</t8599> <t8600>There must surely be a letter or some form of communication, as he personally went to find Hildesheim.</t8600>
<t8601>According to what we know, up to this point, all of his plans have been completed.</t8601><t8602>The ship Tsarine Catherine had such a terrifyingly fast journey that Captain Donelson became suspicious.</t8602><t8603>How could the ship sail smoothly to Galatz through the eerie fog without encountering any trouble or collision?</t8603><t8604>All of the count's preparations were effective.</t8604><t8605>Hildesheim arrived to receive the wooden crate and handed it over to Skinsky.</t8605><t8606>In turn, Skinsky also managed the crate - but that's as far as we know before losing track.</t8606><t8607>Surely, those carrying the crate tried to avoid any encounters with customs or tax officials along the way.</t8607>
<t8608>Now we must ponder what the old count did after arriving in Galatz.</t8608> <t8609>The wooden box was handed over to Skinsky before dawn.</t8609> <t8610>At sunrise, the old count could appear in his true form.</t8610> <t8611>We need to understand why Skinsky was chosen as an accomplice.</t8611> <t8612>According to my husband's diary, Skinsky has connections with the Slovaki people who are trading upstream at the port.</t8612> <t8613>And the rumored murderer is said to be a Slovaki; this notable detail indicates that people often think of these individuals.</t8613> <t8614>Did the old count intend to divert everyone's attention?</t8614> <t8615>That is my conjecture.</t8615>
<t8616>From London, the old count decided to return to Dracula's castle by sea, the surest and most secretive route.</t8616> <t8617>Previously, the Gypsies had taken him and might have had the Slovakians transport the boxes of earth to Varna, then continue by ship to London. Thus, the old count knew exactly who was capable of organizing this service for him.</t8617> <t8618>Now, when the coffin is brought to the surface, he will emerge before sunrise or after sunset and then instruct Skinsky to continue transporting the coffin by river.</t8618> <t8619>He certainly killed this man to cover his tracks and erase any evidence of his presence.</t8619>
<t8620>Reviewing the map, I realized that the nearest river convenient for the Slovakians to travel upstream could only be the Pruth River or the Sereth River.</t8620> <t8621>I saw that Van Helsing's notes mentioned the sounds of water swirling at ear level, the clattering of wood that I sensed while being hypnotized.</t8621> <t8622>Thus, it is possible that the Count is still lying in the coffin, but placed in the hold of an open boat and moved by oars or poles.</t8622> <t8623>Of course, the boat might not necessarily be on the Pruth or Sereth River, but we can determine this.</t8623> <t8624>Among these two small rivers, navigating the Pruth River seems much easier, but the Sereth River, at the Fundu section, receives the Bistriza River, which is a small river flowing around the Borgo Pass.</t8624> <t8625>The bend at the foot of the pass is the point most accessible to Dracula's castle if traveling by water.</t8625>
<t8626>• Mina Harker's Diary (continued)</t8626>
<t8627>After I finished reading, Jonathan rushed to hug me tightly.</t8627> <t8628>The other friends also grasped my hands firmly, looking very enthusiastic.</t8628> <t8629>As for Dr. Van Helsing, he exclaimed:</t8629>
<t8630>— Once again, Mina proves herself worthy of being the guide of our group.</t8630> <t8631>She is truly perceptive, while we are just blind men.</t8631> <t8632>We have found the trail again, and if we encounter the enemy in broad daylight, on the water, our mission will be considered accomplished.</t8632> <t8633>Indeed, he is ahead of us, but he cannot move quickly; how could he dare to leave that coffin? The people escorting the box will surely become suspicious, and at the first sign of anything unusual, they would be ready to throw that cursed thing into the river.</t8633> <t8634>He understands this well and certainly wouldn't dare to do anything foolish.</t8634> <t8635>Now, we need to confer a bit because we must discuss the tasks each of us needs to undertake.</t8635>
<t8636>— I will go look for a boat and the accompanying accessories.</t8636> <t8637>- Lord Godalming said.</t8637>
<t8638>— As for me, I will look to buy a horse to chase him along the riverbank if his boat comes ashore. - Quincey Morris declared.</t8638>
<t8639>— Good. - The professor continued.</t8639> <t8640>- Both of you have valid points, but you shouldn't go alone.</t8640> <t8641>You need to have strength if you encounter strength.</t8641> <t8642>The Slovakians are very strong and aggressive, and they are often fully armed.</t8642>
<t8643>Everyone burst out laughing, as each person was ready to carry a small box of bullets.</t8643>
<t8644>— I have brought along a few guns.</t8644> <t8645>- Morris said.</t8645> <t8646>- They are very handy weapons to fend off attacks from crowds, not excluding packs of wolves.</t8646> <t8647>Everyone should remember that the count always has precautionary measures.</t8647> <t8648>He has tricks that Mrs. Harker here cannot fully hear or understand.</t8648> <t8649>We must be vigilant against any unforeseen events that may occur.</t8649>
<t8650>— I think I can go with Quincey.</t8650> <t8651>- Dr. Seward interjected.</t8651> <t8652>- You too, Arthur, you shouldn't go alone like that.</t8652> <t8653>You might have to confront the Slovakians, and just one mistake could ruin all our plans.</t8653> <t8654>This time, don't let any mistakes happen.</t8654> <t8655>Of course, we will only stop when the Count is beheaded and we ensure that he cannot reincarnate.</t8655>
<t8656>He spoke while looking at Jonathan, whereas Jonathan looked at me as if pondering something.</t8656> <t8657>I understood that he was deeply troubled inside.</t8657> <t8658>Of course, he always wanted to be by my side, but only those on the boat had the chance to destroy the "vampire" (Why do I always hesitate when mentioning this word?).</t8658> <t8659>He stood silently without saying a word.</t8659> <t8660>Van Helsing had to speak up to break the silence:</t8660>
<t8661>— Dear friend Jonathan, there are two reasons why you must listen to us.</t8661> <t8662>First, you are young and no less brave, and you have the ability to fight, while the strength of all of us must be focused on the final battle.</t8662> <t8663>Moreover, you are the one who deserves to directly destroy what has caused you and your loved ones so much suffering.</t8663> <t8664>As for Mina at this time, you don't need to worry at all, I will take care of her to the best of my ability.</t8664> <t8665>After all, I am old, my legs are no longer as agile as before, I am not used to long horseback rides, nor am I good at wielding weapons. But if necessary, I can die like a true young man.</t8665> <t8666>How can I tell you what I am wishing for now! Here’s the plan, you will go upstream by boat with Lord Godalming, while John and Quincey will follow along the shore to guard against the possibility of the Tsarine Catherine docking unexpectedly.</t8666> <t8667>Meanwhile, I will lead Mina to the enemy's lair.</t8667> <t8668>While the old fox is still lying in the coffin on the ship heading upstream and cannot climb onto the land, or does not dare to open the lid for fear of the Slovaki throwing it into the water in panic - we will follow the path that Jonathan once took, from Bistritz to Borgo, and find our way to Dracula's castle. Mina's ability to enter a trance will certainly help us find our way in a strange land - right after the first sunrise on the necessary journey.</t8668> <t8669>There is still so much to do before the snake's den is eradicated.</t8669>
<t8670>Jonathan eagerly interrupted:</t8670>
<t8671>— What, Dr. Van Helsing?</t8671> <t8672>Are you planning to take my Mina to the lair of death in such a despondent state?</t8672> <t8673>That cannot be, it would be of no benefit at all!...</t8673>
<t8674>He was silent for a moment before continuing:</t8674>
<t8675>— Do you know what kind of place that is? Have you ever seen such a terrifying hell?</t8675> <t8676>A place where even the moonlight takes on grotesque shapes? Where every speck of dust whirls madly in the wind, always potentially manifesting into female demons?</t8676> <t8677>Have you ever felt the filthy lips of a "vampire" sink into your neck?</t8677>
<t8678>Then he turned and stared intently at my forehead, raising both hands and exclaiming to the heavens:</t8678>
<t8679>— Oh my God! What did we ever do to anyone to deserve this?</t8679>
<t8680>Unable to bear the rising tide of disappointment in his heart, he let himself fall heavily onto the couch.</t8680> <t8681>But as always, the warm, gentle, and confident voice of the old professor somewhat alleviated the bitterness in his heart and ours.</t8681>
<t8682>— But my friend, if I wish to venture into the lion's den, it is merely to save our dear Mina.</t8682> <t8683>All of us men recognize what needs to be done before that dreadful place is eradicated.</t8683> <t8684>Remember that we are being pushed to the brink.</t8684> <t8685>If we let him slip through our fingers this time, the Count, a clever, immensely powerful, and extremely cunning individual, might decide to lie low for hundreds of years.</t8685> <t8686>And there will come a time when this poor girl here - he said, taking my hand - will become a fiend like the women you saw in Dracula's castle, Jonathan.</t8686> <t8687>Doesn't that sound terrifying to you?</t8687> <t8688>I understand that!</t8688> <t8689>Sorry to upset you again, but what I am saying is necessary, my friend.</t8689> <t8690>Do you think we should let such a harsh reality occur?</t8690> <t8691>However, if that harsh reality does occur, I am ready to give my life to prevent it.</t8691> <t8692>If someone has to go and then remain in Dracula's hell, that person must be me.</t8692>
<t8693>— Then do as you please. - Jonathan said, choking back sobs.</t8693> <t8694>- We are all in the arms of God!</t8694>
<t8695>• A moment later</t8695>
<t8696>Indeed, I was greatly comforted to work with such brave men as my husband's friends! A gentle woman cannot help but admire such serious, honest, and courageous men!</t8696> <t8697>But to be honest, I also secretly appreciate their financial capabilities.</t8697> <t8698>Without money, what could we possibly accomplish at this moment? I am very grateful for the wealth of Lord Godalming and also that of Mr. Quincey Morris.</t8698> <t8699>If they were poor, we could not have set out here, and so quickly at that.</t8699> <t8700>Each of our tasks was well arranged, and everyone tried to complete all their duties.</t8700> <t8701>In just three hours, Lord Godalming and Jonathan had a lovely steam launch ready to depart at the first signal.</t8701> <t8702>Dr. Seward and Morris managed to buy half a dozen thoroughbred horses, already saddled.</t8702> <t8703>We also purchased all necessary maps and equipment.</t8703> <t8704>At 11:40 PM tonight, I will go with Dr. Van Helsing to Veresti, where we can buy a carriage to reach the Borgo Pass.</t8704> <t8705>Of course, we must carry a lot of cash to buy the carriage and some horses.</t8705> <t8706>We have to manage on our own, as we know no one else trustworthy enough to help with the purchases.</t8706> <t8707>The professor is fluent in many languages, so there is no need to worry about this matter.</t8707> <t8708>We are all armed.</t8708> <t8709>Even I have a large revolver.</t8709> <t8710>Jonathan is only calm when he sees that I am armed like the others.</t8710> <t8711>Dr. Van Helsing said the gun could help me if I encounter wolves.</t8711> <t8712>The weather is getting colder with snowstorms swirling around as if to challenge us.</t8712>
<t8713>• A moment later</t8713>
<t8714>I had to be extremely brave to say farewell to my beloved husband.</t8714> <t8715>We might not have the chance to meet again.</t8715> <t8716>Mina, be brave! The old professor is looking at me as if to remind me not to be soft-hearted at this moment.</t8716> <t8717>Do not shed tears if it is not yet the time to cry for joy and happiness.</t8717>
<t8718>Jonathan Harker's Diary</t8718>
<t8719>• October 30</t8719>
<t8720>I am writing these lines under the light streaming through the boiler room door on the boat, while Lord Godalming takes on the responsibility of operating the boiler, as he is quite experienced after many years with his small boat on the Thames and on the lakes in Norfolk. After studying various maps, we decided to follow Mina's hypothesis: if there is a waterway that takes Dracula back to his castle, it can only be the Sereth River, then from the confluence continue along the Bistritza River.</t8720> <t8721>We consider the ideal place to cross the land, between the river and the Carpathian range, to be at 47 degrees north latitude.</t8721> <t8722>Our boat can speed at full throttle without any worries: the river's water is deep everywhere and the distance between the banks is always wide enough for us to glide comfortably on the water, even at night.</t8722> <t8723>Lord Godalming advised me to take a nap, saying that at this moment, one person is enough to manage everything.</t8723> <t8724>But how could I sleep when my mind is always heavy with fear about a vague danger looming over my wife on her way to that dreadful place?</t8724> <t8725>My only solace is to remind myself that our friends are in the protective arms of God. Without this belief, the simplest way for me to escape all the bitterness would be to seek death.</t8725> <t8726>Morris and Dr. Seward set off on horseback ahead of us because the route they have to take is very long and not without hardships.</t8726> <t8727>They followed the Sereth River upstream to maintain a certain view of the river and to avoid the rough, winding roads.</t8727> <t8728>Two riders with spare horses accompanied them in the initial stages to avoid drawing attention.</t8728> <t8729>These two riders will soon return, and then my two friends will have to manage everything on their own.</t8729> <t8730>There may come a time when we will have to meet them to continue the rest of the journey on horseback together.</t8730>
<t8731>Our journey was truly an adventurous and perilous trip!</t8731> <t8732>We quietly traveled through the night, under the increasingly bone-chilling cold, amidst countless sorrowful sounds along the riverbanks, on unfamiliar roads full of dangers, with uncertainties looming overhead, towards a world of hell with countless horrors awaiting each person.</t8732>
<t8733>Lord Godalming had just closed the boiler door...</t8733>
<t8734>• October 31</t8734>
<t8735>Still on the pursuit journey.</t8735> <t8736>A new day is coming.</t8736>
<t8737>Lord Godalming just woke up after a good night's sleep.</t8737> <t8738>The morning weather is very cold.</t8738> <t8739>We passed several cargo barges but did not see any carrying a wooden coffin like we were looking for.</t8739> <t8740>Our flashlight beams scared the sailors, they dropped to their knees on the deck, praying and bowing repeatedly.</t8740>
<t8741>• November 1, afternoon</t8741>
<t8742>Today, there is nothing new.</t8742> <t8743>We haven't found what we were looking for, despite keeping an eye on all the large and small boats we encountered on the river.</t8743> <t8744>Now we are in Bistritza.</t8744> <t8745>If the hypothesis our group proposed is wrong, then we have lost all our chances.</t8745> <t8746>This morning, we were warmly welcomed by the sailors on a government ship and managed to obtain a Romanian flag to put on our boat.</t8746> <t8747>The flag facilitated our approach and inquiries with the boats traveling on the river without any obstacles.</t8747> <t8748>Some Slovakians informed us about a large ship, with several sailors who looked like ghosts on the deck, passing them at an unusually high speed.</t8748> <t8749>They saw this ship near the Fundu junction, where the Bistritza river flows into the Sereth river, so they didn't know which way it intended to turn.</t8749> <t8750>We arrived at Fundu but didn't learn anything new, likely because the ship crossed the river during the night.</t8750> <t8751>My eyes are heavy with sleep, perhaps the biting cold has stimulated an instinct that is growing stronger within me.</t8751> <t8752>Godalming insisted on taking the first watch.</t8752> <t8753>God will bless him, a friend who is wholeheartedly dedicated to my wife and me.</t8753>
<t8754>• November 2, morning</t8754>
<t8755>The sun was already high, but my friend still didn't want to wake me up.</t8755> <t8756>He said that doing so would be wrong, as a peaceful sleep would temporarily make me forget the worries in my heart.</t8756> <t8757>I felt a bit selfish for having slept so long.</t8757> <t8758>But anyway, Godalming was right because clearly this morning I felt like a completely different person, fully capable of controlling the boat and observing everything happening around.</t8758> <t8759>It seemed I had regained my strength and determination.</t8759> <t8760>I wonder where Mina and Dr. Van Helsing are now.</t8760> <t8761>Surely they must have reached Varesti by Wednesday noon as planned.</t8761> <t8762>They would need some time to buy a carriage and a few horses.</t8762> <t8763>If everything went smoothly, they should definitely be at Borgo Pass by now.</t8763> <t8764>May God protect them! I shivered at the thought of what might happen to them.</t8764> <t8765>I wish we could go faster.</t8765> <t8766>But the boat's engines were already running at maximum speed.</t8766> <t8767>How can we catch up with Dr. Seward and Morris?...</t8767> <t8768>There were many small streams flowing down from the cliffs into the river we were traveling on, but they wouldn't pose any significant obstacles to the riders—at least not today, when there was no snow.</t8768> <t8769>I hope to meet them again before reaching Strasba.</t8769> <t8770>Because if we haven't found the Count by then, we will need to meet to reconsider the situation.</t8770>
<t8771>Dr. Seward's Diary</t8771>
<t8772>• November 2</t8772>
<t8773>Three days of continuous travel on the road, without any news, and even if there was, I wouldn't have found the time to record it, because every minute is precious to us at this moment.</t8773> <t8774>We only dared to stop when we had to let the horses rest for a moment; otherwise, we had enough strength to keep going.</t8774> <t8775>Our past wanderings turned out to be incredibly useful; without that experience, could we have been as persistent as we are now? We could only be happy when we reunited with the boat carrying Lord Godalming and our friend Jonathan.</t8775>
<t8776>• November 3</t8776>
<t8777>At Fundu, someone told us that the boat had entered the Bistritza River.</t8777> <t8778>Let's hope they don't freeze to death from the cold!</t8778> <t8779>It seems like it is about to snow.</t8779> <t8780>If the snow falls heavily, we will be significantly hindered.</t8780> <t8781>In that case, we will have to buy a sled to travel like the Russians do.</t8781>
<t8782>• November 4</t8782>
<t8783>Today, after inquiring, we learned that the boat had been damaged and deformed due to the effort of crossing rapids and waterfalls.</t8783> <t8784>The boats of the Slovak people easily overcame these obstacles thanks to the assistance of a tow rope and the unparalleled rowing skills of each person on the boat.</t8784> <t8785>Fortunately, Godalming is an amateur mechanic, so he was able to restore his boat to its original condition.</t8785> <t8786>Finally, he and Jonathan managed to cross the rapids and continue their journey with the help of the locals.</t8786>
<t8787>I think the accident must have caused significant damage to the boat, as some farmers told us that after being repaired, it had stopped quite a few times within their sight.</t8787> <t8788>So we had to move very quickly.</t8788> <t8789>Our help was very necessary before things became too late.</t8789>
<t8790>Mina Harker's Diary</t8790>
<t8791>We arrived in Veresti at noon.</t8791> <t8792>The professor told me that at dawn today, he had a hard time hypnotizing me, and even then, I couldn't say anything else: "Pitch dark, quiet".</t8792> <t8793>He went to buy a carriage and a few horses for reinforcement - if possible - to alternate pulling on the road.</t8793> <t8794>The road we traveled was endlessly long.</t8794> <t8795>This land is truly beautiful and full of interesting things.</t8795> <t8796>If only we were traveling under this sky in different circumstances, how wonderful it would be!</t8796> <t8797>If only Jonathan and I could walk together on this road, how romantic it would be!</t8797>
<t8798>Oh, those unfamiliar people, those magical and wild sceneries!...</t8798>
<t8799>• A moment later</t8799>
<t8800>Dr. Van Helsing returned with a carriage and a few horses.</t8800> <t8801>Additionally, he bought a lot of woolen blankets and a few fur coats to prepare for the bone-chilling cold.</t8801> <t8802>We had to eat well and then depart in an hour.</t8802> <t8803>But the innkeeper brought out a basket of mixed food like what is usually given to soldiers.</t8803> <t8804>The professor had to whisper in my ear that in a week, we might not find any other pleasant food, so we had to make an effort to eat.</t8804>
<t8805>In a little while, we will be on our way.</t8805> <t8806>My body suddenly trembled when I thought of what awaits us along the journey.</t8806> <t8807>But honestly, I still believe in God's protection. Only He knows what will happen, but no matter what, I pray that my beloved husband will return safely.</t8807> <t8808>I wish Jonathan could understand the sincere feelings I have always had for him from the bottom of my heart!</t8808>
<t8809>CHAPTER 27</t8809>
<t8810>Mina Harker's Diary</t8810>
<t8811>• November 1</t8811>
<t8812>We galloped tirelessly all day long.</t8812> <t8813>The horses seemed to understand the kind treatment from their owners and did not let us down.</t8813> <t8814>They were frequently changed, and each one showed obedience to their owners, making us feel encouraged and supported.</t8814> <t8815>Along the way, Van Helsing seemed very reserved; he only told the locals that we were in a hurry to get to Bistritza and paid them generously to change horses for us.</t8815> <t8816>We only stopped briefly to quench our thirst or grab a quick bite before continuing on our journey.</t8816> <t8817>This land is truly wonderful, with breathtaking scenery as far as the eye can see.</t8817> <t8818>The people here are also admirable: they are brave, strong, simple, and equally enthusiastic towards guests.</t8818> <t8819>But they are also very, very superstitious.</t8819> <t8820>At the first house we stopped at, the landlady made the sign of the cross and held up two fingers towards me as if to ward off bad luck upon seeing the mark on my forehead.</t8820> <t8821>I think she even intentionally put garlic in my food for the same reason, but I can't stand the smell of garlic!</t8821> <t8822>Therefore, I thought to myself that I must learn from this experience for the future, not to remove my hat or veil to avoid being discriminated against.</t8822>
<t8823>We still sped forward quickly.</t8823> <t8824>The professor seemed to know no fatigue; he said he didn't need to rest all day, and I could just take a long nap in the car.</t8824> <t8825>At sunset, he hypnotized me again to gather information.</t8825> <t8826>I answered as usual: "Pitch dark, the sound of water waves, the creaking of the wooden floor."</t8826> <t8827>So, our enemy was still underwater.</t8827> <t8828>Thinking about Jonathan suddenly made me shiver, even though at this moment I had no doubts about the harmful things to him and myself.</t8828> <t8829>I wrote these lines while waiting for people to prepare horses and carriages at a farm.</t8829> <t8830>Finally, Dr. Van Helsing had to lie down for a bit; he looked much older and seemed exhausted.</t8830> <t8831>When we continue on our way, I will persuade him to let me hold the reins, while he rests to regain his strength.</t8831> <t8832>I said we had more than a day's journey ahead, so he couldn't be exhausted at the moment when strength was most needed.</t8832>
<t8833>Everything is ready again.</t8833> <t8834>We continue our journey.</t8834>
<t8835>• November 2, morning</t8835>
<t8836>I succeeded in persuading him: we took turns holding the reins throughout the night.</t8836> <t8837>A new day had begun, it was bright but cold.</t8837> <t8838>The weather was strangely oppressive, I say oppressive because I couldn't find a more accurate word, as both of us felt an indescribable suffocation.</t8838>
<t8839>It must be said that it was very cold; without the fur coats, I don't know how we would have managed.</t8839> <t8840>At dawn, Van Helsing hypnotized me once again.</t8840> <t8841>According to him, I responded: "Pitch dark, the sound of waves roaring, the creaking of wooden planks."</t8841> <t8842>So the river is undergoing some transformation as the wooden coffin is being carried upstream.</t8842> <t8843>I hope my husband will not be in danger.</t8843> <t8844>But anyway, we are still under God's protective embrace.</t8844>
<t8845>• November 2, afternoon</t8845>
<t8846>Continuously walking on the road, not even thinking about taking a break.</t8846> <t8847>The landscape spread out before us, the peaks of the Carpathians in Veresti suddenly loomed around us and seemed to block the path we had to take.</t8847> <t8848>We tried to encourage each other and also to encourage ourselves, not to fall into a state of pessimism.</t8848> <t8849>Professor Van Helsing told us we would reach the Borgo Pass at sunrise.</t8849> <t8850>This area doesn't have many replacement horses, so he planned to keep the newly bought ones to go all the way.</t8850> <t8851>We had two spare horses, and they were all thoroughbreds with enough patience to travel long distances.</t8851> <t8852>Nothing went wrong with us on the way, so much so that I could easily hold the reins and control the team of horses.</t8852> <t8853>We will reach the Borgo Pass early tomorrow morning, and then we can rest a bit.</t8853> <t8854>What will happen to us tomorrow?</t8854> <t8855>The eerie castle where my beloved husband endured so many horrors is approaching.</t8855> <t8856>May God guide us in the right direction?</t8856> <t8857>May God watch over my husband and all the friends I love, who are facing a looming danger?</t8857> <t8858>As for me, it doesn't matter if He doesn't protect me.</t8858> <t8859>Oh Lord! I am a filthy being in Your eyes and will remain filthy until You allow me to stand before You like my honest friends.</t8859>
<t8860>Abraham Van Helsing's Notes</t8860>
<t8861>• November 4</t8861>
<t8862>I write these lines of advice for my faithful friend John Seward, a doctor in the Purfleet area of London, in case I may never see him again.</t8862> <t8863>The day has dawned, and I write by the flickering firelight throughout the night thanks to Mina's hand.</t8863> <t8864>It is cold, very cold, so cold that the sky turns gray with the first snowflakes of winter.</t8864> <t8865>When they fall, these snowflakes will reign over the Borgo Pass throughout the bleak winter season.</t8865> <t8866>Mina also seems numb from the cold.</t8866> <t8867>The frost has turned her into a completely different person.</t8867> <t8868>She sleeps, sleeps, and sleeps.</t8868> <t8869>Normally she is so active, yet she did nothing at all yesterday.</t8869> <t8870>Even eating does not appeal to her.</t8870> <t8871>And she hasn't touched the small notebook she always carries with her to jot down notes whenever she rests along the way.</t8871> <t8872>I feel something unusual constantly ringing in my ears.</t8872> <t8873>However, yesterday afternoon, she somewhat regained her usual agility.</t8873> <t8874>The long sleep during the day seemed to have relieved her fatigue and made her cheerful and pleasant as always.</t8874> <t8875>As dusk fell at the foot of the pass, I intended to hypnotize her to see if there was anything new, but my goodness, I tried and tried with no result.</t8875> <t8876>My ability is diminishing day by day, and this evening, I have completely failed.</t8876>
<t8877>Now I would like to continue recounting the subsequent events.</t8877> <t8878>Mina no longer uses shorthand to write her diary, so I have to write it for her, even though I'm not very skilled at it, to ensure that the passing days do not fade into oblivion.</t8878>
<t8879>We arrived at Borgo Pass at dawn yesterday.</t8879> <t8880>As soon as I saw the first light of dawn, I immediately stopped the car and told Mina to prepare for hypnosis.</t8880> <t8881>I made a temporary bed out of fur coats: Mina would lie on it to enter a trance, but indeed this time it was very difficult for me as well.</t8881> <t8882>The answer was still the same: "Pitch dark, swirling water."</t8882> <t8883>As soon as she said this, she woke up, her face looking visibly happier and more radiant.</t8883> <t8884>We continued on our way and soon crossed the pass.</t8884> <t8885>Her enthusiasm had turned her into a very eager person.</t8885> <t8886>Clearly, a new strength was guiding her, as I saw her suddenly point towards the road ahead and say:</t8886>
<t8887>— That's the right path.</t8887>
<t8888>— How do you know?</t8888>
<t8889>— It's only natural.</t8889>
<t8890>She was silent for a moment, then continued:</t8890>
<t8891>— Hasn't my brother Jonathan gone over there already?</t8891> <t8892>Didn't he write that in his diary?</t8892>
<t8893>At first, I found it strange, but then I quickly regained my composure because, in reality, there was only one interprovincial road like this here.</t8893> <t8894>It seemed like this was a road with very few passersby, quite different from the road from Bukovina to Bistritza, which was wider, gravel-paved, and always bustling with people.</t8894> <t8895>We followed the road Mina had just pointed out.</t8895> <t8896>When we encountered other paths, we suddenly became doubtful.</t8896> <t8897>Are these really the right roads? I wasn't sure, because they were all rugged and somewhat scattered with fallen snow.</t8897> <t8898>Our horses had stepped in and were the only ones diligently moving along the road.</t8898> <t8899>I loosened the reins and let them trot.</t8899> <t8900>We gradually recognized everything Jonathan had described in his admirable journal.</t8900> <t8901>The horses continued to rhythmically clop their hooves on the seemingly endless paths.</t8901> <t8902>At first, I had to make Mina lie down to sleep.</t8902> <t8903>She tried and eventually fell into a deep sleep.</t8903> <t8904>She slept continuously, so soundly that I became alarmed and had to wake her up.</t8904> <t8905>But she still slept as if nothing had happened.</t8905> <t8906>I didn't dare to wake her abruptly because I knew she had endured too much, and after all, a good sleep would surely make her feel better.</t8906> <t8907>Suddenly, I felt like I was at fault with her.</t8907> <t8908>Therefore, I quietly returned to my seat, holding the reins and urging the horses to go faster.</t8908> <t8909>Mina was still asleep.</t8909>
<t8910>The twilight gradually descended, casting a golden hue like chicken fat on the snowflakes and our long, lanky shadows on the steep mountain slopes.</t8910> <t8911>Our car climbed higher and higher, amidst a desolate, remote, rugged landscape, as if we were reaching the end of the world!</t8911>
<t8912>That was also the moment when I woke Mina up without much difficulty, but the only thing was that I could no longer easily hypnotize her.</t8912> <t8913>Not only did she not go into a trance, but she also acted as if I didn't exist in this world.</t8913> <t8914>I kept trying and trying, and eventually, both she and I sank into darkness.</t8914> <t8915>I suddenly realized that the sun had sunk behind the mountain ranges.</t8915> <t8916>Mina suddenly burst out laughing, making me turn to look at her.</t8916> <t8917>She was still completely awake.</t8917> <t8918>I was surprised, feeling that something was not right.</t8918> <t8919>I stood up, took the reserved firewood from the cart, and found a spot to light a fire.</t8919> <t8920>She prepared dinner while I untied the horses to feed them.</t8920> <t8921>When I returned to the fire, the meal was already prepared.</t8921> <t8922>I intended to serve Mina, but she smiled and said that she had already eaten because she was too hungry to wait for me.</t8922> <t8923>I felt unhappy, suspecting that she was lying but said nothing for fear of upsetting her.</t8923> <t8924>I sat and ate alone to get it over with, then went back to the cart to get a fur coat, put it on, and sat by the fire.</t8924> <t8925>I told Mina to sleep first, so I could stay awake and watch over everything.</t8925> <t8926>But in reality, I had been awake for a long time, and when I suddenly remembered this, I quickly turned to look at her: she was lying in the fur coat I had just brought, her eyes still wide open, staring at me.</t8926> <t8927>How sparkling those eyes were! I just sat there and only dozed off for a moment when the sky began to lighten.</t8927> <t8928>I intended to turn and hypnotize her once more, but wait!</t8928> <t8929>It seemed she was still awake.</t8929> <t8930>The sun rose high, and only then did she fall asleep.</t8930> <t8931>Even though it was too late, she still slept deeply and heavily to the point that I had no way to wake her up.</t8931> <t8932>In the end, I had to carry her and place her in the cart after harnessing the horses.</t8932> <t8933>Mina was still asleep.</t8933> <t8934>She looked much more rosy.</t8934> <t8935>That phenomenon did not signal anything good to me.</t8935> <t8936>I was scared, scared, and scared.</t8936> <t8937>I was afraid of everything, even my own thoughts.</t8937> <t8938>But no matter what, I still had to see it through to the end.</t8938> <t8939>The game was a gamble between life and death, or perhaps even more than that.</t8939> <t8940>We could no longer turn back.</t8940>
<t8941>• November 5</t8941>
<t8942>Perhaps I must recount every detail exactly!</t8942>
<t8943>Because although both you and I have witnessed many strange things firsthand, you can still deduce from my thoughts that countless terrifying events and prolonged nervous tension have all ended due to the madness in my mind.</t8943>
<t8944>We still trudged on throughout the entire winter day and were approaching the mountain peaks that blocked a land which became increasingly desolate and savage in the eyes of the traveler.</t8944> <t8945>I cannot recount the countless silent caves and deep crevices interspersed with roaring waterfalls, as if nature occasionally played a masquerade before its own Lent.</t8945> <t8946>Mina remained deeply asleep.</t8946>
<t8947>Feeling a gnawing hunger, I had to sit and eat alone because I couldn't wake her up to share the meal.</t8947> <t8948>I suddenly became worried.</t8948> <t8949>"If she keeps sleeping all day - I thought to myself - then perhaps I'll have to sleep all night." We were traveling on a rough road, crudely made in the old style.</t8949> <t8950>Despite my best efforts, I still nodded off.</t8950> <t8951>When I awoke with a guilty feeling, Mina was still asleep.</t8951> <t8952>The sun had already shifted to the afternoon.</t8952> <t8953>But everything had changed.</t8953> <t8954>The suspicious mountain peaks seemed farther away, and we were near a steep hill, upon which stood an ancient, solitary castle, resembling the one Jonathan described in his diary.</t8954> <t8955>Joy and worry almost intertwined within me at the same time, because now, whether good or bad, the end was near.</t8955> <t8956>I called Mina to wake her up to try hypnotizing her once more, but it was still a failure.</t8956> <t8957>Darkness began to fall, covering all the desolate paths, I unhitched the horses and led them to a sheltered spot to feed them, and lit a fire so Mina could warm herself in the fur cloak.</t8957>
<t8958>She looked as lively as a bird and more radiant and beautiful than ever.</t8958> <t8959>I fumbled around preparing dinner, but she refused to eat with the simple reason that she didn't feel hungry.</t8959> <t8960>I didn't insist because I knew it would be useless.</t8960> <t8961>As for me, I had to eat, because I needed the strength to prepare for any dangerous challenges.</t8961> <t8962>To guard against any unforeseen events, I sat up and drew a circle with Mina at its center, then I crushed the holy wafers into fine powder and sprinkled it evenly around the circle to ensure every part was well protected.</t8962> <t8963>During that time, Mina sat silently like a corpse, her complexion gradually turning a pale, ghostly white like the snow at night.</t8963> <t8964>But when I approached her, she suddenly clung tightly to me.</t8964> <t8965>I felt her body trembling violently.</t8965> <t8966>Finally, waiting until she returned to normal, I dared to ask:</t8966>
<t8967>— Don't you want to move a little closer to the fire?</t8967>
<t8968>Actually, I intended to see if you could do it.</t8968> <t8969>She obediently stood up, but after taking just one step, she suddenly halted as if her feet were chained.</t8969>
<t8970>— Why don't you keep walking? - I pressed.</t8970>
<t8971>She shook her head and went back to sit in the exact spot she had been sitting, her eyes wide open looking at me just like the eyes of someone who has been abruptly woken from a deep sleep.</t8971>
<t8972>— I can't! - She replied curtly and then fell silent.</t8972>
<t8973>But I felt happy, because I understood her impossibility, whatever I doubted was no longer its true nature.</t8973>
<t8974>But the sudden, prolonged neighing of the horses made me think otherwise.</t8974> <t8975>I jumped before I could think to approach and soothe them.</t8975> <t8976>Feeling someone approaching, they immediately licked my hand gently but did not forget to let out another series of neighs before falling silent again.</t8976> <t8977>But only for a moment, then they started neighing incessantly once more.</t8977> <t8978>I had to soothe them many times during the night, before that cold moment when the heartbeat of the earth and sky fell to its weakest point.</t8978> <t8979>At that coldest moment, the fire began to die down, forcing me to stoke it once more, as the snow started to fall heavily amidst the freezing fog.</t8979> <t8980>Even though it was dark, I could still faintly see my surroundings.</t8980> <t8981>But the snowstorm and fog seemed to be forming the shapes of women, faintly visible in their flowing white dresses sweeping the ground.</t8981> <t8982>Everything exuded an aura of death, sorrow, and an eerie silence.</t8982> <t8983>The horses let out long, mournful neighs as if anticipating the worst to come.</t8983> <t8984>I shivered with a vague sense of fear until I suddenly remembered the safety circle I had just drawn.</t8984> <t8985>I began to think that all the apparitions were due to the darkness, my own cowardice, and my lingering fatigue.</t8985> <t8986>Could it be that the memories of all the terrible things Jonathan had experienced had turned me into a madman?</t8986> <t8987>Yes, the swirling, chaotic snow and fog made me realize the shadows of those women in white, flickering and hovering as if about to pounce on me.</t8987> <t8988>The horses huddled together and occasionally let out faint whimpers of fear, much like human gestures.</t8988> <t8989>I suddenly felt worried for Mina, as the strange faces began to flicker closer to us, but she still sat calmly and smiled at me as if nothing was happening.</t8989> <t8990>When I stood up to stoke the fire again, she suddenly pulled me back:</t8990>
<t8991>— Don't, don't, don't step out of the circle.</t8991> <t8992>You can only be safe if you stay in here! - She said, her voice sounding weak and vague as if echoing from a distant realm.</t8992>
<t8993>I turned back and looked straight into her eyes:</t8993>
<t8994>— And you? You are the one who scares me!</t8994>
<t8995>Hearing that, she burst into laughter, a gentle smile but as surreal as her voice.</t8995>
<t8996>— Afraid because of me? Why? No one in this world can protect those being hunted more safely than I can, sir.</t8996>
<t8997>I was about to ask what she meant when a sudden strong gust of wind blew, rekindling the nearly extinguished flame.</t8997> <t8998>It was only at this moment that I noticed the fresh red scar on her forehead.</t8998> <t8999>Oh my God! It was now clear to me.</t8999> <t9000>I suddenly understood everything, as the swirling faces of the snowstorm approached very close but seemed to halt before my Sacred Circle.</t9000> <t9001>Then they took shape right before my eyes, unless God had taken my sanity - in flesh and blood; they were the three women that Jonathan had encountered in the castle when they approached to caress and kiss his neck that day.</t9001>
<t9002>I recognized the round, alluring bodies, the wickedly flirtatious eyes, the white teeth and the rosy, plump skin, then the bright red lips full of lustful desire.</t9002> <t9003>They giggled foolishly at Mina, their laughter piercing the silence of the dark night.</t9003> <t9004>They clung tightly to each other, pointing directly at her and speaking a long string of words, their voices clear and gentle like crystal, just as Jonathan had described in his diary.</t9004>
<t9005>— Come here with us, little brother, come here, come here!</t9005>
<t9006>I turned back to look at Mina, feeling weak, but inside I felt as if I was seeing a glimmer of hope.</t9006> <t9007>Because her fearful and disgusted eyes, and her terror, told me that I could still be full of hope.</t9007> <t9008>Simply put, she had not yet become an accomplice of those women.</t9008> <t9009>I grabbed some firewood near me and held out a holy wafer, then slowly approached them.</t9009> <t9010>They immediately backed away, but did not forget to let out those chilling, shrill laughs.</t9010> <t9011>I continued to build the fire, no longer afraid, because I understood that we would be unharmed as long as we stayed within our invisible fortress.</t9011> <t9012>And with a weapon like the one I had, those women could not come near me or Mina.</t9012> <t9013>Moreover, as long as she remained within the Sacred Circle, she could not step out, just as they could not step in.</t9013> <t9014>The horses stopped neighing and stomping wildly; they lay down on the ground, letting the falling snow cover them, making them look like small snow-covered hills.</t9014> <t9015>I understood that they were no longer afraid of those ghostly figures.</t9015>
<t9016>We just sat still in one place until we noticed the bright pink halos of the sun piercing through the melancholy color of the white snow.</t9016> <t9017>All last night, I lived in a state of heavy worry, sorrow, and fear. But life truly returned to me when the sun's rays burst forth on the horizon.</t9017> <t9018>As soon as the sun rose, the lurking spirits immediately vanished with the swirling snowstorms and fog.</t9018> <t9019>The flickering, translucent shadows gradually drifted towards the old castle and disappeared within it.</t9019>
<t9020>Like an instinct, I turned to look at Mina, intending to tell her to prepare for another hypnosis attempt.</t9020> <t9021>But she had fallen into a deep sleep without me noticing.</t9021> <t9022>Knowing that I couldn't wake her up, I tried to risk hypnotizing her even while she was asleep.</t9022> <t9023>But she didn't respond to any questions.</t9023> <t9024>I quietly went to prepare the carriage to continue our journey, but my God, the sight before me made my legs go weak: our horses had frozen to death at some point.</t9024> <t9025>I understood that a new day would bring me many hardships.</t9025> <t9026>I would wait until the sun was high in the sky, because only then, even if it snowed or was foggy, I would feel secure going to the places I needed to reach.</t9026> <t9027>Lunch would give me the strength before tackling a difficult challenge.</t9027> <t9028>Mina was still in a peaceful sleep.</t9028> <t9029>May God bless her.</t9029>
<t9030>Jonathan Harker's Diary</t9030>
<t9031>• November 4, evening</t9031>
<t9032>The accident on the river was indeed a terrible surprise for us.</t9032> <t9033>If not for that, we could have caught up with the ship long ago, and by then, Mina would surely have been freed.</t9033> <t9034>I can only dare to think that she is crossing the patches of forest growing along that dreadful place.</t9034> <t9035>We have found horses and are on the trail of the devil's tracks.</t9035> <t9036>I take advantage of this moment to write these lines while Godalming is busily preparing.</t9036> <t9037>We are carrying weapons.</t9037> <t9038>If they want to mess with us, the gypsies better watch out.</t9038> <t9039>Oh, how wonderful it would be if Morris and Seward were here with us?</t9039> <t9040>But in any case, we must remain hopeful.</t9040> <t9041>And if I have no other chance to write, then Mina, I bid you farewell forever!</t9041> <t9042>May God bless and protect you!</t9042>
<t9043>Dr. Seward's Diary</t9043>
<t9044>• November 5</t9044>
<t9045>The dawn light helped us recognize the Gypsies hastily moving away from the river with a cart.</t9045> <t9046>Snow fell lightly, and the air suddenly had an oddly exhilarating effect.</t9046> <t9047>It might just be a subjective feeling, but our discouragement seemed to stem from something unusual.</t9047> <t9048>I could clearly hear the long, mournful howls of wolves echoing from a distant place, the falling snow driving them down the mountain to threaten us from all sides.</t9048> <t9049>The horses were ready to join us on a treacherous journey.</t9049> <t9050>And at the end of that journey, some of us might have to stay behind forever.</t9050> <t9051>Only God knows who that person will be, where, when, and how...</t9051>
<t9052>Van Helsing's Notes</t9052>
<t9053>• November 5, afternoon</t9053>
<t9054>At least I am still intact and must thank God, even though the reality unfolding before my eyes is truly terrifying.</t9054> <t9055>To let Mina sleep peacefully within the Sacred Circle, I cautiously made my way towards the castle.</t9055> <t9056>When I arrived in Veresti, I bought a blacksmith's hammer and threw it into the car.</t9056> <t9057>I have just set foot in the castle.</t9057>
<t9058>All doors are open, but I must carefully lift each one off its rusted hinges for fear that some mishap or plot might suddenly slam them shut, blocking my way out.</t9058> <t9059>I learned that through the harsh reality of Jonathan.</t9059> <t9060>His bitter diary pages helped me find the path leading to the old church, where I know my mission awaits.</t9060> <t9061>The suffocating air made me dizzy, as if I had just entered a cloud of sulfur smoke.</t9061>
<t9062>I'm not sure if my ears are ringing or if the howling of the wolves is echoing from a distant place?</t9062> <t9063>I suddenly felt a pang of fear when I thought of Mina: I am caught in a dilemma.</t9063> <t9064>I didn't dare bring her here because I thought the Sacred Circle would protect her from falling into the clutches of the "vampire".</t9064> <t9065>But what about the wolves?</t9065> <t9066>I am determined that my duty is to be here, in this dark castle; as for the wolves, we will endure them if it is God's will! Either way, it comes down to choosing between death and freedom, and I am the one making that choice for my young friend.</t9066> <t9067>As for myself, I find it not difficult at all: the lair of the "vampire" is worse to me than the jaws of the wolves.</t9067> <t9068>Therefore, I continue my work.</t9068>
<t9069>I know I need to discover at least three graves - three graves with people lying in them.</t9069> <t9070>Therefore, the first task is to search, search, until I find a woman lying sprawled in the sleep of a "vampire," her body full of vitality and exuding a sensual beauty that makes me shudder as if I am about to commit a crime.</t9070> <t9071>That's it!</t9071> <t9072>I am sure that if someone were in my situation, they would feel a stirring in their heart and lose all the rationality of a man.</t9072> <t9073>He would hesitate, hesitate, hesitate until the enchanting beauty of that woman drains his soul; then he would become dazed, dazed, dazed until the sun goes to sleep and the ghost awakens.</t9073> <t9074>The young beautiful woman would open her eyes full of yearning for love, her luscious red lips would place a passionate kiss somewhere on his body, and the man within him would gradually disappear.</t9074> <t9075>Thus, another victim becomes an accomplice of the devil, another one in the terrifying dark army of the immortals!...</t9075>
<t9076>Yes, I was mesmerized by the women lying in a tomb stained by the dust of time over many centuries, despite the foul odor emanating from everywhere in the count's lair.</t9076><t9077>Yes, I, Van Helsing, was excited, even though I had decided to act with the hatred rising in my heart and was obsessed with a desire to prolong my actions, rendering all my combat abilities completely paralyzed.</t9077><t9078>I fell into a drowsy sleep, enchanted by the mesmerizing allure of the woman, but then I was startled awake by a mournful wail in the still air, like a funeral dirge.</t9078><t9079>That cry was Mina's.</t9079><t9080>I steeled myself to complete my first search mission.</t9080><t9081>While moving some stones aside, I discovered a second woman, also with dark hair like the first one.</t9081><t9082>I did not dare to hesitate and gaze, fearing the same disheartening feeling of hesitation as before.</t9082><t9083>The search continued until I found, under a large, tall tomb seemingly reserved for someone dearly beloved by the count - the blonde woman whom I, after Jonathan, had once seen in the mist.</t9083><t9084>She looked beautiful, alluring, and seductive to the point that the deep instincts of a man stirred within me a desire to protect someone of the opposite sex and an indescribable emotion.</t9084><t9085>But thank God, Mina's cry of pain still echoed in my ears, and before being completely bewitched by the woman's beauty, I managed to regain my senses to carry out my dreadful task.</t9085><t9086>I felt as if I had searched all the tombs in the ancient church and there might not be any more such places.</t9086><t9087>But no, there was still one more tomb, larger, more majestic, and seemingly more noble than the ones I had encountered before, engraved with a single name: DRACULA.</t9087>
<t9088>That is precisely the last place where the "Vampire King" hides his immortality.</t9088> <t9089>The emptiness inside the tomb proves what I already knew.</t9089> <t9090>Before starting the task of returning those women to their former selves, I carefully placed pieces of holy bread inside Dracula's tomb to permanently banish him from this safe haven.</t9090> <t9091>I had to begin such a dreadful task before retreating.</t9091> <t9092>If there were only one corpse to deal with, it wouldn't be too difficult.</t9092> <t9093>But there are three corpses! This means I will have to repeat the process two more times! For me, if the execution was terrifying when standing before Lucy, how much more horrifying will it be to stand before three strangers who have lived for centuries, growing ever more powerful with the passage of time, thus protecting their absurd existence.</t9093>
<t9094>— So there you have it, my friend John! Is that the work of a butcher? If it weren't for the resolute thought of a true death, and a life placed in such a terrible vice, I might never have dared to go all the way.</t9094> <t9095>I am still trembling, but until the entire job is finished, may God help me return to myself!</t9095> <t9096>I returned to the first woman and suddenly had the feeling of witnessing a fleeting satisfaction on her face just before she was freed, as if to acknowledge that her soul had been completely conquered: without such a feeling, I certainly wouldn't dare to do the work of a butcher.</t9096> <t9097>I couldn't bear the hair-raising sound of driving the stake into the girl's body.</t9097> <t9098>I was so terrified that I abandoned the job.</t9098> <t9099>But in the end, everything was finished!</t9099> <t9100>Now I can mourn for those wretched souls, those who could rest peacefully in the contentment of a true death, even if that moment of peace only briefly passed before my eyes before turning to dust and returning to the past, as if the deaths that had been restrained for centuries finally asserted their rightful claim and proclaimed: "Here I am."</t9100>
<t9101>Before leaving the castle, I must ensure that all the passages are blocked so that the old count can never enter and become immortal again.</t9101>
<t9102>A moment after I returned to the Sacred Circle, where Mina was deep in sleep, she suddenly woke up and looked at me.</t9102>
<t9103>— Come here, - She told me, her voice so painful that I couldn't help but feel moved - we will leave this dreadful place together.</t9103> <t9104>We need to go meet my husband.</t9104> <t9105>I know he is heading towards us.</t9105>
<t9106>She looked emaciated, her skin was pale, and she appeared haggard, with only her eyes remaining clear and sparkling.</t9106> <t9107>I felt happy when I noticed her paleness and sorrow, because not long ago, I was haunted by the terrifying thought of the "vampire" sleep within her.</t9107>
<t9108>So, in a state filled with faith and hope, but also not lacking in anxiety, we went together towards the east to find our friends and him, the one who, as Mina had affirmed, would come to meet us.</t9108>
<t9109>Mina Harker's Diary</t9109>
<t9110>• November 6</t9110>
<t9111>The evening gradually faded as Van Helsing and I walked eastward, where I knew Jonathan was heading towards us.</t9111>
<t9112>We couldn't walk fast, even though we were going downhill, because we had to carry rather bulky fur coats to guard against the cold and snow in case we had to rest along the way.</t9112> <t9113>We also had to carry some of the reserve supplies.</t9113> <t9114>Indeed, we were in a state of isolation and, as far as our strength could penetrate the snow curtain, we would likely struggle to find a shelter.</t9114> <t9115>Not even a mile in, I was forced to sit down on the ground to rest because my legs were utterly exhausted.</t9115> <t9116>Behind us, Dracula's castle was etching stark white lines against the horizon.</t9116> <t9117>We had descended a long way, yet the hill bearing the castle still loomed, almost entirely obscuring the desolate, cold Carpathian range.</t9117> <t9118>Only at this point did we notice again the mournful howls of the wolves echoing from afar.</t9118> <t9119>They were still very far away, but those savage howls, though somewhat muffled by the falling snow, still echoed as if to threaten the lone travelers on the long road.</t9119> <t9120>Watching Professor Van Helsing as he walked and glanced around, I understood he was trying to find some shelter that could help us be less exposed to an attack.</t9120> <t9121>We could still make out the rugged road stretching out of sight, even though snow had already fallen heavily below.</t9121>
<t9122>After a while, the professor signaled for me to stand up and walk over to him.</t9122> <t9123>He had just found a rather ideal spot, a cave with an entrance resembling a vestibule situated between the two ends of the cave.</t9123> <t9124>He reached out and pulled me in.</t9124>
<t9125>— Try to look, maybe you will be safe here.</t9125> <t9126>- He said.</t9126> <t9127>- If the wolves come, I can take them down one by one for you to see.</t9127>
<t9128>Then he turned around, took some fur coats, and made a fairly neat bed for me, just enough for me to lie down, and forced me to eat some compressed rations.</t9128> <t9129>But I couldn't eat.</t9129> <t9130>I really didn't care about anything other than sitting and breathing for a while to catch my breath, even though I really wanted to please him.</t9130> <t9131>He seemed sad but didn't have the heart to blame me with a single word.</t9131>
<t9132>I saw him quietly step out onto a rock, take out his binoculars, and look towards the horizon.</t9132> <t9133>Suddenly, he shouted out to me:</t9133>
<t9134>— Look, Mrs. Mina? Come here and see this?</t9134>
<t9135>I stood up abruptly, hurriedly walked closer to him, and took the binoculars he had just handed over.</t9135> <t9136>Snowflakes began to fall thickly and swirl chaotically due to the gusts of cold wind blowing in.</t9136> <t9137>However, occasionally the gales would stop blowing, giving me a fairly clear view.</t9137> <t9138>From the rock ledge where I was standing, I saw the horizon wide open before my eyes.</t9138> <t9139>I could make out in the distance, beyond the thick snowy plain, a river winding like a soft ribbon.</t9139> <t9140>Not far ahead of us - in fact, so close that we were surprised we hadn't noticed sooner - was a group of people riding horses uphill.</t9140> <t9141>Among the group was a long wagon, occasionally lurching forward like a dog being prodded each time it strayed off the path.</t9141> <t9142>This group stood out clearly against the white snow, so much so that I immediately recognized them as farmers, or Bohemians, thanks to the style of clothing they wore.</t9142>
<t9143>On the vehicle, there was a large rectangular coffin.</t9143> <t9144>My heart felt like it was about to leap out of my chest, as the scene before me made me think of the ending of a ghost story that was closely tied to my own life.</t9144> <t9145>In no time, another day would pass, and I fully understood that right after sunset, the thing lying in that coffin would be free to move around in some suitable guise to evade all pursuits.</t9145> <t9146>Fearful inside, I turned to look at the professor, but I didn't know where he had disappeared to, which scared me out of my wits.</t9146> <t9147>A moment later, I saw him return at my feet, scattering pieces of holy bread in a protective circle around the rock, similar to the circle that had protected us the night before.</t9147>
<t9148>After finishing the work, he climbed up to sit near me and said:</t9148>
<t9149>— At least here, she isn't afraid of him.</t9149>
<t9150>He picked up the binoculars again and looked towards the horizon in front of him:</t9150>
<t9151>— Look at that, they're in such a hurry, they're urging the horses to run at full speed.</t9151>
<t9152>He remained silent for a moment, then continued in a contemplative tone:</t9152>
<t9153>— They are racing against the sun...</t9153> <t9154>Perhaps we have arrived too late!</t9154> <t9155>May God's will come true?</t9155>
<t9156>Another violent storm suddenly swept in, erasing everything, but this event lasted only for a very short time.</t9156> <t9157>When the sky calmed down again, the binoculars in the professor's hands were pointed down at the plain.</t9157> <t9158>He suddenly exclaimed:</t9158>
<t9159>— Look! Look down there!</t9159> <t9160>There are two horsemen rushing from the south.</t9160> <t9161>It must be Quincey and John.</t9161> <t9162>Take the binoculars and look, quickly, or the storm will rise again.</t9162>
<t9163>I held the binoculars.</t9163> <t9164>Indeed, those two men must be Dr. Seward and Mr. Quincey Morris.</t9164> <t9165>I believe so, as neither of them bore the familiar appearance of Jonathan.</t9165> <t9166>But I also knew Jonathan was not far from us.</t9166> <t9167>I noticed that a little to the north of where the two riders were, there were two other men also hastily spurring their horses to a gallop.</t9167> <t9168>I immediately recognized Jonathan, and of course, the other was Lord Godalming.</t9168> <t9169>They were also chasing after the carriage and the escorting party.</t9169> <t9170>Hearing my account, Van Helsing cheerfully shouted "hooray" like a schoolboy, and after carefully observing ahead until a snowstorm obscured his view, he held the Winchester rifle ready for battle.</t9170>
<t9171>— They are all converging towards the same point.</t9171> <t9172>- He said.</t9172> <t9173>- The time will come when we surround those Bohemians.</t9173>
<t9174>I also groped for the gun, because while we were talking, the howling of the wolves had become closer and much more terrifying.</t9174> <t9175>Another moment of calm wind helped us see more clearly.</t9175> <t9176>Before our eyes was a magical and mysterious scene, with heavy snowflakes falling very close to us while the sun was casting its last rays of the day and gradually setting behind the distant mountain peaks.</t9176> <t9177>Holding the binoculars and scanning back and forth towards the horizon, I noticed here and there groups of two or three black dots, or more, moving on the white snow carpet: those were the hungry wolves rushing to compete for the unfamiliar prey.</t9177>
<t9178>Each minute of waiting for us felt like a century.</t9178> <t9179>The cold wind howled, blowing into fierce, raging gusts, angrily driving the snowflakes into a flurry and piling them into successive crescent-shaped ice ridges.</t9179> <t9180>Occasionally, we couldn't even recognize our own outstretched arms; but whenever the wind calmed, we had the chance to gaze far into the distance.</t9180> <t9181>For a long time, we had developed the habit of attentively observing the moments of sunrise and sunset.</t9181> <t9182>And this time was no different, the sun would disappear behind the mountain range in just a moment.</t9182> <t9183>Without a clock, we couldn't believe we had been waiting for the other three groups for nearly an hour.</t9183> <t9184>The north wind continued to blow more fiercely and intensely.</t9184> <t9185>But it seemed that after the short gusts, the snow stopped falling, and if it did, it was blown far away from us.</t9185> <t9186>Now, we could clearly identify each member of every group, the hunters and the hunted.</t9186>
<t9187>It seems that the Bohemian group did not realize someone was urgently following them, or at least they did not care about it.</t9187> <t9188>However, they still hurried forward as the sun was gradually sinking behind the mountains.</t9188> <t9189>As the group approached, Professor Van Helsing and I retreated to hide behind a rock, weapons ready in hand.</t9189> <t9190>Clearly, he did not want to let them pass by unnoticed.</t9190> <t9191>It seemed that none of them suspected our presence.</t9191>
<t9192>Suddenly, two voices shouted together: "Stop!" I recognized Jonathan's voice, hoarse from an indescribable emotion.</t9192> <t9193>The other voice, more resolute and calm, belonged to Quincey Morris.</t9193> <t9194>Although they did not understand what the two were saying, the Bohemian crowd could not mistake the emotions contained in their voices, even if it was in a foreign language.</t9194> <t9195>They instinctively reined in their horses.</t9195> <t9196>At that moment, Lord Godalming and Jonathan rode up close on one side, while Dr. Seward and Morris flanked the other side.</t9196> <t9197>The leader of the gypsy group, a stunningly handsome young man riding a centaur-like horse, glared and signaled my friends to retreat, angrily ordering his followers to move forward.</t9197> <t9198>They pulled the reins, urging their horses to lunge forward.</t9198> <t9199>The four men immediately placed their hands on their gun triggers - an action that could not be misinterpreted - ordering the gypsies to stop.</t9199> <t9200>At the same time, Van Helsing and I stepped out from behind the rock, weapons in hand.</t9200>
<t9201>Seeing themselves surrounded, the group of Gypsies pulled the reins to stop their horses.</t9201> <t9202>The leader said something I didn't understand, I only knew that the followers simultaneously grabbed their weapons, which were all knives and pistols, to prepare for battle.</t9202> <t9203>It seemed like the outcome would be decided within a few minutes.</t9203>
<t9204>The leader pulled the reins, urging his horse to break away from the group and move to the front, pointing towards the sun that was setting very close to the mountain peaks and the castle, then said something.</t9204><t9205>In response, each member of our group of four allies immediately dismounted and rushed towards the carriage.</t9205><t9206>Seeing Jonathan rush into the danger zone should have made me tremble with fear, but the thrill of the battle made me and my friends forget everything.</t9206><t9207>I did not show any fear, but only had a wild desire to fight.</t9207><t9208>At our unexpected action, the leader shouted out orders once more.</t9208><t9209>The Bohemian crowd immediately gathered around the carriage, forming a chaotic circle.</t9209>
<t9210>In that chaos, I saw Jonathan on one side and Quincey Morris on the other, both desperately rushing to make their way to the vehicle.</t9210> <t9211>They needed to reach the vehicle to complete their mission before sunset.</t9211> <t9212>It seemed nothing could stop the two of them at this moment.</t9212> <t9213>The clashing of swords and the flashing of blades, along with the savage howls of the approaching wolves, seemed to not concern them.</t9213> <t9214>Jonathan's unyielding bravery and determination clearly demoralized those blocking his path, causing them to start moving aside, leaving an open way for him.</t9214> <t9215>Just a split second was enough for him to leap onto the vehicle and throw the coffin to the ground with all his strength and fury.</t9215> <t9216>At the same time, Morris also bravely made his way through.</t9216> <t9217>In my interrupted breaths, I watched Jonathan, but Morris's desperate scream startled me: the flashing blades of the Gypsies continuously swung around him and his short sword like a flying steel net.</t9217> <t9218>At first, I thought there would be no problem, but when he rushed towards Jonathan - who had just jumped down from the vehicle - I suddenly realized his left hand was clutching his side, futilely trying to cover a stream of blood seeping through his fingers.</t9218> <t9219>Despite this, with the strength of a man in despair, he still threw himself into prying open one side of the wooden coffin lid with his knife, simultaneously with Jonathan on the other side.</t9219> <t9220>The efforts of the two men forced the coffin lid to gradually give way, the nails creaking as they were pulled out, and finally, the wooden lid was forcefully thrown to the ground.</t9220>
<t9221>Seeing the gun barrels pointing directly at them, entrusting their lives to Lord Godalming and Dr. Seward, the Bohemian group all hesitated, none of them daring to resist.</t9221> <t9222>The sun began to set, giving way to the darkness that gradually enveloped the snow-covered world.</t9222> <t9223>I witnessed with my own eyes the old count lying stretched out on the filthy soil inside the fateful wooden coffin, beneath the wood shavings that had peeled off when the coffin was thrown from the carriage to the ground.</t9223> <t9224>He looked as pale as a leaf, more accurately like a wax figure.</t9224> <t9225>His eyes were wide open, clearly showing a terrifying hatred.</t9225>
<t9226>The moment I saw him was also the moment his eyes gleamed with triumph as he caught a glimpse of the late sunset.</t9226> <t9227>But at that very moment, Jonathan's blade had already swung up like a flashing lightning bolt.</t9227> <t9228>I gasped in shock as I realized that the slash had just severed his long neck.</t9228> <t9229>At the same time, Quincey Morris's short sword managed to stab right into the heart of the wretched old man.</t9229>
<t9230>Like a miraculous scene, yes, right before our eyes, just as everyone had barely managed to let out a sigh of relief, the entire body of the old count suddenly turned into layers of mist and dissipated very quickly.</t9230> <t9231>Within me began to surge an indescribable joy at that miraculous moment, or rather a sense of unprecedented peace and serenity gradually spread across my entire face.</t9231>
<t9232>At this moment, Dracula's castle stood towering against the deep red backdrop of the sunset horizon.</t9232>
<t9233>Witnessing firsthand that we were the cause leading to a strange end for the one lying in the coffin, the Bohemian group immediately pulled the reins and turned their horses back, none of them saying a word to each other, as if their entire lives depended on that corpse.</t9233> <t9234>Those who couldn't jump onto their horses quickly leaped onto the wagon and called out to those galloping ahead not to leave them behind.</t9234> <t9235>The pack of wolves also quietly retreated along the old path, leaving us alone in a strangely silent world.</t9235>
<t9236>Quincey Morris collapsed, his elbows on the ground, his hand still clutching the bleeding wound.</t9236> <t9237>I ran over in shock, as the Sacred Circle could no longer hold me back.</t9237> <t9238>The two doctors also rushed to his side.</t9238>
<t9239>Jonathan knelt down and hurriedly supported his friend.</t9239> <t9240>The young man groped to grasp my hand with his weak breath.</t9240> <t9241>My face must have shown extreme anxiety because I saw him smile and say to me:</t9241>
<t9242>— I feel very honored to have accomplished something.</t9242> <t9243>Oh! My God, - He exclaimed and suddenly sat up, pointing at me - even if I have to die, I have no regrets!</t9243> <t9244>Look, everyone, look!</t9244>
<t9245>The sunset cast its final rays, making the face glow like a halo.</t9245> <t9246>All my friends knelt down and exclaimed "Amen" as they followed the direction of his pointing finger.</t9246> <t9247>He whispered:</t9247>
<t9248>— God has blessed us: so it was all not in vain! Everyone, just look, even the snowflakes cannot be purer than her forehead.</t9248> <t9249>So the curse has been lifted.</t9249>
<t9250>He departed amidst our boundless love and immense pain: on his lips, a gallant young man, a quiet smile remained forever imprinted.</t9250>
<t9251>CONCLUSION</t9251>
<t9252>Jonathan Hacker's Notes</t9252>
<t9253>So, it has been seven years since the day we escaped those nightmares.</t9253> <t9254>We are the ones who enjoy happiness at the cost of the pains in our own lives.</t9254> <t9255>The fact that our son was born on the anniversary of Quincey Morris's death brought even more joy to Mina and me.</t9255>
<t9256>I know, you have kept in your heart a secret belief that some aspect of your heroic friend has been instilled in our child.</t9256> <t9257>We gave the boy the names of all the members of our group of friends, but Quincey is still the name we use the most.</t9257>
<t9258>Last summer, on the way back to visit Transylvania, we returned to the land filled with terrible memories that are indelible in everyone's mind.</t9258> <t9259>We couldn't believe the things we saw and heard were still so vivid, even though all traces had been erased.</t9259> <t9260>All that remained was the majestic, silent, solitary castle standing alone on a windswept hill.</t9260>
<t9261>We reminisce about the old times with a heavy heart, as Lord Godalming and Dr. Seward have both married and are living very happy lives.</t9261> <t9262>I reopened the papers stored in the iron chest after our first return, a long time ago.</t9262> <t9263>Strangely enough, among all the documents that make up the record of this story, it would be very difficult to find an authentic part: everything is just typewritten copies, except for the last diary pages of mine, Mina, Seward, and a few notes from Professor Van Helsing.</t9263> <t9264>That being said, how could we possibly make others acknowledge these papers as evidence of a tragic and mystical story now? Once, Van Helsing held our son in his arms and said a few very brief words:</t9264>
<t9265>— Evidence?</t9265> <t9266>We don't need anyone to believe us.</t9266> <t9267>The important thing is that one day this kid will understand how brave his mother was.</t9267> <t9268>Now he knows she is a gentle and loving mother.</t9268> <t9269>Later on, he will also know that there were men who truly loved him and dared to do everything for his birth.</t9269>
