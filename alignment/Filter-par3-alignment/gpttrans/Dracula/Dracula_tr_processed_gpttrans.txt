<t1>Jonathan Harker's diary</t1>
<t2>(written in stenography)</t2>
<t3>May 3rd.</t3> <t4>Bistriţa2 - 8 PM on the evening of May 1st.</t4> <t5>We left Munich at 8:35 and arrived in Vienna early the next morning; we should have arrived at 6:46, but the train was an hour late.</t5> <t6>From what I could see from the train and the short walk I took in the streets, Budapest looks like a wonderful place.</t6> <t7>Since we arrived late in Budapest and would be departing as close to the scheduled time as possible, I was afraid to stray too far from the station.</t7> <t8>I got the impression that we were leaving the West and entering the East; the most Western of the magnificent bridges over the Danube River, with its noble breadth and depth, carried us into the traditions of Turkish rule.</t8>
<t9>We departed with quite good timing and arrived in Klausenburg after nightfall.</t9> <t10>I spent the night here at the Royale Hotel.</t10> <t11>For dinner, or rather a late-night dinner, I had chicken cooked with red pepper; it tasted very good but was quite thirst-inducing.</t11> <t12>(Note: Get the recipe for Mina.)</t12> <t13>I asked the waiter and he said it was called paprika hendl and that I could find it everywhere in the Carpathian Mountains as it is a local dish.</t13> <t14>My broken German was very useful here; I really don't know how I would have managed without it.</t14>
<t15>When I had some time to myself in London, I visited the British Museum and did some research in the library among books and maps related to Transylvania; I thought that having some preliminary knowledge about the country wouldn't be insignificant when negotiating with a nobleman from that country.</t15> <t16>I saw that the region it is named after is at the easternmost edge of the country, at the border of Transylvania, Moldavia, and Bukovina, in the middle of the Carpathian Mountains; one of the wildest and least known parts of Europe.</t16> <t17>I couldn't find a map or study that gave the exact location of Dracula's Castle, as this country didn't have maps comparable to our detailed Ordnance Survey maps; but I saw that the town of Bistriţa, which Count Dracula named, was a fairly well-known place.</t17> <t18>While talking to Mina about my journey, I will record some of my notes here as they might refresh my memory.</t18>
<t19>There are four different nationalities in the population of Transylvania: in the south, the Saxons and the Wallachians, who are mixed with them and descended from the Dacians; in the west, the Hungarians; in the east and north, the Székelys.</t19> <t20>I am going among the last group, who claim to be descended from Attila and the Huns.</t20> <t21>This claim might be true because when the Hungarians conquered the country in the eleventh century, they found that the Huns had already settled there.</t21> <t22>I read that all known superstitions in the world seem to gather in the horseshoe formed by the Carpathian Mountains as if it were the center of a fanciful vortex; if so, my visit could be very interesting.</t22> <t23>(Note: I must ask the Count about all this.</t23><t24>)</t24>
<t25>Although my bed was comfortable enough, I couldn't sleep well because I had all sorts of strange dreams.</t25> <t26>A dog barked under my window all night; maybe my sleeplessness had something to do with that; or maybe it was because of the red pepper since I had to drink all the water in my pitcher but still couldn't quench my thirst.</t26> <t27>I fell asleep towards morning and woke up to the persistent knocking on my door; at that moment, I think I was in a deep sleep.</t27> <t28>For breakfast, I ate some more red pepper, a type of porridge made from cornmeal which they said was called mamaliga, and a dish called impletata, which is eggplant stuffed with minced meat and is an excellent meal.</t28> <t29>(Note: Get the recipe for this as well.)</t29> <t30>Since the train was supposed to leave a little before eight - or rather it was supposed to leave at 7.</t30> <t31>30, I had to rush my breakfast because after running to the station, I had to sit in the carriage for more than an hour before we started moving.</t31> <t32>It seems to me that as we move further east, the trains get more delayed.</t32> <t33>Who knows what they are like in China?</t33>
<t34>Throughout the day, we slowly progressed through a terrain filled with all kinds of beauty.</t34> <t35>Sometimes, at the tops of steep hills, we saw small villages and castles similar to those we had seen in old prayer books; sometimes, we passed by rivers and streams with wide, stony banks that suggested they had been subjected to great floods.</t35> <t36>It takes a large amount of strong flowing water to sweep and clean the outer edges of a river.</t36> <t37>At every train station, there were crowds of people dressed in various kinds of attire, sometimes large gatherings.</t37> <t38>Some wore short jackets, round hats, and homemade trousers, just like those in our region or those I saw while passing through France and Germany; but others were very interesting.</t38> <t39>The women looked beautiful unless you got close to them, but their waistlines were quite thick.</t39> <t40>All of their clothes had white sleeves in one way or another; many wore wide belts with lots of ribbons hanging from them, resembling ballet dresses; but of course, they had underskirts underneath.</t40> <t41>The strangest people we saw were the Slovaks, who looked more barbaric than the rest with their large cowboy hats, wide, sack-like dirty white trousers, white linen shirts, and enormous, heavy belts almost a foot wide, studded all over with brass nails.</t41> <t42>They wore high boots into which they tucked their trousers, and they had long black hair and thick black mustaches.</t42> <t43>They were very impressive but not attractive.</t43> <t44>They could be placed on stage right now as an old Eastern bandit gang.</t44> <t45>But as I was told, they were quite harmless and moreover, people who lacked self-defense skills.</t45>
<t46>When we arrived in Bistriţa, a very interesting old settlement, it was the dark side of twilight.</t46> <t47>Since it is almost on the border - as the Borgo Pass starts there and extends to Bukovina - it has quite a stormy nature and definitely bears the traces of it.</t47> <t48>Fifty years ago, there was a series of major fires that caused terrible damage at five different times.</t48> <t49>At the very beginning of the seventeenth century, the city was subjected to a siege that lasted three weeks and lost 13,000 people from its population; war-related losses increased due to famine and disease.</t49>
<t50>Count Dracula directed me with great pleasure to the Golden Krone Hotel, which I saw was old-fashioned in every way; because, of course, I wanted to see all the traditions unique to the country.</t50> <t51>Clearly, I was expected, for as I approached the door, I was met by a cheerful elderly woman in traditional peasant attire - a long white undergarment, with a colorful apron made of fabrics at the front and back that seemed too tight for modesty.</t51> <t52>As I approached, she greeted me with a nod and said, "English Herr?"</t52> <t53>"Yes," I said, "Jonathan Harker." She smiled and spoke to an elderly man in a white-sleeved shirt who had followed her to the door.</t53> <t54>The man left but quickly returned with a letter in hand:</t54>
<t55>My friend,</t55>
<t56>Welcome to the Carpathian Mountains.</t56> <t57>I am eagerly awaiting you.</t57> <t58>Sleep well tonight.</t58> <t59>Tomorrow at three o'clock, the stagecoach will depart for Bukovina; a seat has been reserved for you.</t59> <t60>My carriage will wait for you at the Borgo Pass and will bring you to me.</t60> <t61>I hope your journey from London has been pleasant and that you will enjoy the time you spend in my beautiful lands.</t61>
<t62>Your friend</t62>
<t63>DRACULA</t63>
<t64>May 4th.</t64> <t65>- I learned that the hotel owner had received a letter from the Count instructing him to arrange the best seat in the carriage for me; however, when I asked questions about the details, he somehow seemed tight-lipped and acted as if he didn't understand my German.</t65> <t66>Yet this couldn't be true because until that moment he had perfectly understood my German; at the very least, he was definitely answering my questions as if he understood me.</t66> <t67>He and his wife, the elderly lady who greeted me, looked at each other with an expression full of fear.</t67> <t68>The man mumbled that the money was sent within the letter and that this was all he knew.</t68> <t69>When I asked him if he knew Count Dracula and if he could tell me anything about his castle, both he and his wife crossed themselves and refused to speak further, saying they knew nothing.</t69> <t70>The departure time was so close that I had no time to ask anyone else, for everything was very mysterious and, in any case, not at all reassuring.</t70>
<t71>Just before leaving, the elderly woman came to my room and, in an extremely distraught manner, said:</t71>
<t72>“Is it necessary for you to leave?</t72> <t73>Ah! Young Herr, is it necessary for you to leave?” He was so excited that he seemed to have lost his command of German and mixed it with another language I did not know.</t73> <t74>I could only understand him by asking a lot of questions.</t74> <t75>When I told him that I needed to leave as soon as possible and that I was busy with an important task, he asked once more:</t75>
<t76>"Do you know what today is?"</t76> <t77>I replied that it was the fourth of May.</t77> <t78>She shook her head from side to side and spoke again:</t78>
<t79>“Ah, yes! I know him, I know him!</t79> <t80>But do you know what today is?”</t80> <t81>When I said I didn't understand, he continued:</t81>
<t82>“Today is the eve of St. George's Day.</t82> <t83>Don't you know that when the clock strikes midnight tonight, all the evil forces in the world will be free to roam around?</t83> <t84>Do you know where you are going, what you are going towards?”</t84> <t85>He was in such a state of obvious anxiety that I tried to comfort him, but it had no effect.</t85> <t86>Finally, he fell to his knees and begged me not to go, or at least to wait a day or two before setting out.</t86> <t87>All this was very silly, but I did not feel comfortable.</t87> <t88>However, there was a job to be done, and I could not allow anything to hinder it.</t88> <t89>So, I tried to get him to his feet and thanked him as seriously as I could, saying that my duty was inevitable and that I had to go.</t89> <t90>Upon this, he stood up, wiped his eyes, and took a cross from around his neck and gave it to me.</t90> <t91>I didn't know what to do because, as someone affiliated with the Anglican Church, I had been taught to see such things as a form of idolatry; but still, it seemed very rude to reject such a well-meaning and kind-hearted old lady.</t91> <t92>I suppose he saw the indecision on my face because he put the rosary around my neck and said, “For your mother's sake,” and left the room.</t92> <t93>I am writing this part of the journal, of course, while waiting for the delayed carriage, and the cross is still around my neck.</t93> <t94>I don't know if it's because of the old woman's fear, but I don't feel as peaceful as I usually do.</t94> <t95>If this notebook reaches Mina before I do, let it convey my farewell words to her.</t95> <t96>Here comes the carriage!</t96>
<t97>May 5.</t97> <t98>- The Castle - The grayness of the morning passed and the sun rose on the distant horizon; the horizon presented a jagged appearance with things I couldn't tell if they were trees or hills, because the horizon was so far away that big and small things had merged together.</t98> <t99>I am not sleepy, and since I won't be called until I wake up, naturally I will write until I get sleepy.</t99> <t100>There are many strange things to write about, and so that the person reading this doesn't think I had a very nice meal before leaving Bistriţa, let me write exactly what I had for dinner.</t100> <t101>I ate something called "bandit steak" - bacon, onions, and beef seasoned with red pepper, skewered and roasted over a fire in the simple London cat meat4 style!</t101> <t102>The wine was Golden Mediasch, which, though not bad on the tongue, left a strange bitterness.</t102> <t103>I only had a few glasses of it, that's all.</t103>
<t104>When I got into the carriage, the coachman had not yet taken his place, and I saw him talking with the hotel owner.</t104> <t105>It was clear that they were talking about me because they occasionally glanced at me, and some of those sitting on the bench outside the door—who were referred to by a word meaning "gossip-mongers"—went over to the two of them, eavesdropped, and then looked at me; many of them looked at me with pity.</t105> <t106>I frequently heard many strange words being repeated, as there were people of many nationalities in the crowd; so I quietly took out my multilingual dictionary from my bag and looked up those words.</t106> <t107>I must say that these words did not cheer me up at all, as they included ordog - devil, pokol - Hell, stregoica - witch, vrolok and vlkoslak - words in Slovak and Serbian respectively, meaning something like werewolf or vampire.</t107> <t108>(Note: I must ask the Count about these superstitions.</t108><t109>)</t109>
<t110>When we set out, the entire crowd gathered at the inn's door, which had grown considerably by that time, made the sign of the cross and raised two fingers towards me.</t110> <t111>With some difficulty, I managed to get one of the other travelers to explain what they meant; at first, he didn't want to answer my question, but when he learned that I was English, he explained that it was a charm or protection against the evil eye.</t111> <t112>Just as I was setting out to meet an unknown man in an unknown place, this situation did not please me at all; however, everyone was so kind-hearted, so sorrowful, and so friendly that it was impossible not to be affected.</t112> <t113>I will never forget the last glimpse of the courtyard of the inn and the crowd of interesting people making the sign of the cross around the wide arched passage, with the lush leaves of oleander and orange trees planted in green barrels behind it.</t113> <t114>Then, our coachman, whose wide linen trousers - they called them gotza - covered the entire front seat, cracked his huge whip over the four small horses harnessed abreast, and we began our journey.</t114>
<t115>If I had known the language -or rather, the languages- spoken by the other passengers, although I would not have been able to get rid of them so easily, shortly after setting off, my spiritual fears and memories related to them faded away in the beauty of the scenery.</t115><t116>In front of us stretched a green sloping terrain filled with forests, adorned here and there with steep hills, crowned with clusters of farmhouses with trees or side walls facing the road.</t116><t117>Everywhere, fruit blossoms were blooming with surprising density - apple, plum, pear, cherry; as we moved along the road, I could see that the green grass under the trees was speckled with fallen petals.</t117><t118>The road stretched out among the green hills they called "Mittelland" here, disappearing as it extended over grass-covered curves or being blocked by the edges of pine forests as it descended the slopes like tongues of flame spilling out here and there.</t118><t119>The road was rough, but still, it felt as if we were flying over it with an excited rush.</t119><t120>At that time, I did not understand what this rush meant, but it was clear that the coachman was determined not to waste any time reaching Prundu Bârgăului.</t120><t121>They said that this road was in perfect condition during the summer, but had not yet been restored after the winter snows.</t121><t122>In this respect, it is different from most of the roads passing through the Carpathian Mountains, because it is an old tradition that those roads are not kept in very good condition.</t122><t123>In the past, the hospodars did not repair the roads so that the Turks would not think they were preparing to bring in foreign troops, thus accelerating a war ready to break out at any moment.</t123>
<t124>Rising from the green hills of the Mittelland to the steep peaks of the Carpathian Mountains, large forest-covered slopes ascended.</t124> <t125>These rose on our right and left, with the evening sun fully casting its light on them, revealing the magnificent colors of these beautiful mountain ranges. Thus, in the shadows of the peaks, dark blue, purple, green where grass and rocks mingled, and brown appeared, extending into an endless depth of steep and jagged cliffs that continued until they disappeared where the snow-capped summits rose majestically in the distance.</t125> <t126>In the mountains, here and there, we saw ravines where the glint of water falling from high places was visible as the sun set.</t126> <t127>As we wound our way around the base of a hill on our serpentine path, one of my travel companions touched my arm when a great snow-covered peak appeared directly in front of us:</t127>
<t128>"Look! Isten szek!" -"The seat of God!"- and he crossed himself with a reverent expression.</t128> <t129>As we wound our way on our seemingly endless journey and the sun sank lower behind us, the shadows of evening began to silently envelop us.</t129> <t130>This was further accentuated by the snowy peak of the mountain, which still held the sunset upon it, appearing to glow with a light and cool pinkness.</t130> <t131>From time to time, we passed by Czechs and Slovaks in remarkable attire, and unfortunately, I noticed that goiter was a common condition.</t131> <t132>There were numerous crosses by the roadside, and as we passed them, all my companions crossed themselves.</t132> <t133>Here and there, there were peasant women and men kneeling before a shrine, who did not turn to look as we approached, wholly absorbed in their devotions, their eyes and ears shut off from the outside world.</t133> <t134>Many things were new to me: for instance, the haystacks in the trees, the beautiful clusters of birch trees with white trunks shimmering like silver among the delicate green of their leaves.</t134> <t135>From time to time, we overtook a leiter-wagon, an ordinary peasant cart with a long, sinuous spine adjusted to the roughness of the road.</t135> <t136>On this vehicle, there was always a group of farmers returning home, with white sheepskins for the Czechs and colored ones for the Slovaks; the second group carried long sticks with axes at the end, giving them the air of spears.</t136> <t137>As evening fell, the air grew very cold, and the increasingly dense twilight seemed to blend into a thick mist with the dimness of trees like oak, beech, and pine; yet, as we descended from the pass into the valleys deep between the arms of the mountains, we occasionally came across dark fir trees backed by patches of snow that had not yet melted.</t137> <t138>At times, the road was intersected by pine forests that seemed to close in on us in the darkness, while the early evening sunset, sinking ever lower, cast strange shapes with the ghostly clouds drifting incessantly through the valleys of the Carpathians, creating an unusually eerie and majestic effect with the large patches of gray covering the trees here and there.</t138> <t139>Sometimes the hills were so steep that, despite our driver's haste, the horses could only proceed slowly.</t139> <t140>I wanted to get out of the carriage and approach the horses, but the driver would not allow it.</t140> <t141>"No, no!" he said; "You must not walk here; the dogs are too savage," then, making it clear he was making a cruel joke by looking around to catch the approving smiles of the others, he added, "You will have enough of such matters to deal with before you sleep." </t141> <t142>The only stop he made was for a moment to light the lamps.</t142>
<t143>It seemed as if an excitement had arisen among the passengers when it got dark, and the passengers kept talking to the coachman one after another, as if insisting that he go faster.</t143><t144>The coachman mercilessly whipped the horses with his long whip and urged them to make more effort with encouraging wild shouts.</t144><t145>Then, in the middle of the darkness ahead, as if there was a gap between the hills, I saw a piece of some kind of gray light.</t145><t146>The excitement of the passengers grew even more; the frenzied coach was shaking on its large leather springs and swaying from side to side like a ship tossed in a stormy sea.</t146><t147>I had to hold on.</t147><t148>The road improved a bit, and it seemed as if we were flying forward.</t148><t149>Then, it seemed as if the mountains on either side were closing in on us; we were entering the Borgo Pass.</t149><t150>Most of the passengers, with an insistence that accepted no objections, individually offered me gifts; of course, they were unusual and strange in nature, but each was given with good intentions, a kind word, a prayer, and a mixture of those strange gestures of fear I had seen outside the hotel in Bistriţa (cross and protection against the evil eye).</t150><t151>Later, as we were flying forward, the driver leaned forward and the passengers on either side stretched their necks out from the edge of the coach, eagerly and attentively looking into the darkness.</t151><t152>It was clear that something very exciting was happening or expected, but despite asking each passenger, no one gave me the slightest explanation.</t152><t153>This state of excitement continued for a short while; finally, we saw the pass opening up ahead of us to the east.</t153><t154>There was a heavy and oppressive storm feeling in the air, with black clouds rolling over our heads.</t154><t155>The mountain ranges seemed to have separated the two airs, and we had entered the stormy one.</t155><t156>Now I too was looking out to see the vehicle that would take me to the Count.</t156><t157>I was expecting to see the brightness of the lamps from the darkness at any moment; but everywhere was dark.</t157><t158>The only light was the flickering light of our own coach, which showed the steam from the breath of our rapidly running horses like a white cloud.</t158><t159>Now, we could see the sandy road stretching out white in front of us, but there was no sign of any vehicle.</t159><t160>The passengers, seeming to mock my disappointment, sighed with satisfaction and leaned back.</t160><t161>When the driver looked at his watch and said something to the others that I could barely hear, I had already started thinking about what I should do; these words were spoken so quietly, in such a low tone, that I think he said: "An hour early."</t161><t162>Then, turning to me, he said in German even worse than mine:</t162>
<t163>“There is no car here.</t163> <t164>After all, Herr is not expected.</t164> <t165>He will now go to Bukovina and return here tomorrow or the day after; the best is the day after tomorrow.”</t165> <t166>As he spoke, the horses began to neigh, snort from their noses, and lunge forward wildly; so much so that the driver had to restrain them.</t166> <t167>Then, amidst the villagers' chorus of cries and the universal gesture of crossing themselves, a light carriage with four horses came up the hill behind us, caught up to us, and began to move alongside our carriage.</t167> <t168>As beams of light fell on them, in the light emitted by our lamps, I saw that the horses were coal black and magnificent animals.</t168> <t169>The carriage was driven by a tall man with a long brown beard that hid his face and a large black hat.</t169> <t170>I could only see the gleam of a very bright pair of eyes, which appeared red under the lamp light as they turned towards us.</t170> <t171>He said to the driver:</t171>
<t172>“You're early tonight, my friend.”</t172> <t173>The man replied, stuttering:</t173>
<t174>“The English gentleman was in a hurry.”</t174> <t175>In response, the foreigner said:</t175>
<t176>“I guess that's why you wanted him to continue to Bukovina.</t176> <t177>You can't fool me, my friend; I know a lot and my horses are fast.”</t177> <t178>He was smiling as he spoke, and the light of the lamp fell upon a hard mouth with overly red lips and sharp-looking, ivory white teeth.</t178> <t179>One of my fellow travelers whispered a line from Bürger's "Lenore" to another:</t179>
<t180>For the dead travel fast.</t180> <t181>-</t181>
<t182>(Because the dead travel fast.</t182><t183>)</t183>
<t184>The strange driver had clearly heard the words, as he looked up with a gleaming smile.</t184> <t185>The passenger turned his face away while making the sign of the cross with two fingers.</t185> <t186>"Give me Herr's luggage," said the driver; my bags were handed over with great enthusiasm and placed in the carriage.</t186> <t187>Then, as the other carriage was nearby, I transferred from our carriage to the other without stepping on the ground, with the coachman helping me with a grip as strong as steel; he must have had tremendous strength.</t187> <t188>Without a word, he flicked the reins, the horses turned, and we swiftly advanced into the darkness of the pass.</t188> <t189>When I looked back, I saw the steam rising from the post coach's horses and the silhouettes of my former travel companions making the sign of the cross under the light of the lamps.</t189> <t190>Then, the driver cracked his whip, called out to his horses, and they swiftly set off towards Bukovina.</t190>
<t191>As they were engulfed in darkness, I felt a strange shiver and loneliness descended upon me; however, a cloak was thrown over my shoulders and a blanket over my knees, and the coachman said in perfect German:</t191>
<t192>“The night is cold, mein Herr, and my master Count has ordered me to take every care of you.”</t192> <t193>“If you wish, there is a flask of slivovitz [local plum brandy] under the seat.”</t193> <t194>I did not drink, but knowing it was there was comforting.</t194> <t195>I was feeling a bit strange and quite scared.</t195> <t196>If there had been another option, I think I would have chosen it rather than continue this unknown night journey.</t196> <t197>The carriage was moving straight ahead at a fast pace, then we made a complete turn and proceeded along another straight path.</t197> <t198>It seemed to me as if we were passing the same place over and over again; therefore, I paid attention to a noticeable spot and realized that this was indeed the case.</t198> <t199>I wished I had asked the coachman what all this meant, but I was really afraid to do so because, given my position, I thought that any objection, if there was a desire for delay, would have no effect.</t199> <t200>But a little later, wondering how time was passing, I struck a match and looked at my watch by its flame; it was a few minutes to midnight.</t200> <t201>This shocked me somewhat, because I suppose the general superstitions about midnight had been reinforced by my recent experiences.</t201>
<t202>Then, somewhere far down the road, a dog began to howl at the farmhouse - a long, painful wail as if from fear.</t202><t203>The sound was taken up by another dog, then another, and another; until now, carried by the wind softly moaning through the pass, a wild howling began from every part of the country, from the gloom of the night, in every corner that the imagination could grasp.</t203><t204>At the first howl, the horses became tense and started to rear, but they calmed down when the driver spoke to them soothingly, though they were trembling and sweating as if they had escaped from a sudden fear.</t204><t205>Then, in the distance, a higher and sharper howl - the howl of wolves - began in the mountains on either side of us, and this howl affected the horses and me in the same way, for while I was thinking of jumping out of the carriage and fleeing, they reared once more and dashed forward madly; so much so that the driver had to use all his tremendous strength to prevent them from bolting away.</t205><t206>However, within a few minutes, my ears got used to the sound, and during this time, the horses calmed down enough for the driver to get down and stand in front of them.</t206><t207>The driver petted them, soothed them, and whispered something into their ears, as I have heard horse trainers do, with an extraordinary effect, for with his caressing, the horses, though still trembling, became quite docile once again.</t207><t208>The driver took his place again and set off at great speed, shaking the reins.</t208><t209>This time, after reaching the far corner of the pass, he suddenly turned onto a narrow road that sharply curved to the right.</t209>
<t210>Before long, we were surrounded by trees; in some places, they leaned over the road as if we were passing through a tunnel; once again, huge frowning rocks on both sides were bravely protecting us.</t210> <t211>Even though we were in a sheltered area, we could hear the increasing sound of the wind; because the wind was moaning and howling between the rocks, and as we moved quickly, the branches of the trees were hitting each other.</t211> <t212>The air grew colder and beautiful, powdery snow began to fall; so much so that soon we and everything around us were covered with a white blanket.</t212> <t213>The sharp wind still carried the howling of the dogs; although the sounds were getting fainter as we progressed on our way.</t213> <t214>The howling of the wolves was coming closer and closer, as if they were surrounding us from every direction.</t214> <t215>I had begun to get terribly scared, and the horses shared my fear; but the coachman was not disturbed at all.</t215> <t216>He continued to turn his head from side to side, but I couldn't see anything in the dark.</t216>
<t217>Suddenly, I saw a faint, flickering blue flame ahead on our left.</t217> <t218>At the same moment, the driver saw it too; he immediately stopped the horses, got down, and disappeared into the darkness.</t218> <t219>I didn't know what to do, and as the howling of the wolves got closer, I became even more indecisive; but just as I was thinking about this, the driver suddenly reappeared, took his place without saying a word, and we continued our journey.</t219> <t220>I think I must have fallen asleep and continued seeing this event in my dream because it seemed to repeat endlessly; now, looking back, everything seems like a terrible nightmare.</t220> <t221>At one point, the flame appeared so close to the road that despite the surrounding darkness, I could observe the driver's movements.</t221> <t222>He quickly went to where the flame was - the flame must have been quite faint because it didn't seem to illuminate the area around it - and he gathered some stones and arranged them in a certain way.</t222> <t223>Once, a strange optical illusion occurred: When the driver stood between me and the flame, he didn't block it, because despite him standing between us, I could see the ghostly shape of the flames.</t223> <t224>This situation startled me, but since the image was fleeting, I concluded that my eyes were straining in the dark and deceiving me.</t224> <t225>Then, for a while, no blue flame was seen and we quickly moved into the darkness, surrounded by the howling of wolves that seemed to be following us in a moving circle.</t225>
<t226>Finally, there came a moment when the driver went farther than he had ever gone before, and in his absence, the horses began to tremble worse than ever and to snort and neigh in fear.</t226> <t227>I could see no reason for this, as the howling of the wolves had completely ceased; but just then, the moon, gliding through the dark clouds, appeared behind the rugged ridge of a pine-covered rock, and by its light, I saw a circle of wolves surrounding us, with their white teeth, red tongues hanging out of their mouths, long strong legs, and coarse fur.</t227> <t228>In the relentless silence that had fallen upon them, they were a hundred times more terrifying than when they howled.</t228> <t229>As for me, I felt as if I were paralyzed with fear.</t229> <t230>One can only truly understand the real meaning of such terrifying things when confronted with them.</t230>
<t231>As if the moonlight had a special effect on them, the wolves suddenly started howling.</t231> <t232>The horses jumped here and there, rearing up and looking around in despair with pitiable eyes; but the living ring of terror surrounded them from every direction, and they were inevitably trapped within the circle.</t232> <t233>I called out to the coachman to come, because it seemed our only chance was to break out of the circle and help the man come to us.</t233> <t234>I shouted and struck the side of the carriage, hoping that the noise would scare the wolves in that direction and give the coachman a chance to realize the trap we had fallen into.</t234> <t235>I don't know how he got there, but I heard the coachman's voice rise in a commanding tone, and when I looked towards the sound, I saw him standing on the road.</t235> <t236>When he waved his long arms as if pushing aside an intangible barrier, the wolves retreated, far back.</t236> <t237>At that moment, a heavy cloud passed in front of the moon, and thus we were plunged into darkness again.</t237>
<t238>When I was able to see again, the driver was climbing into the car and the wolves had disappeared from sight.</t238> <t239>All of this was so strange and so eerie that a terrible fear descended upon me; I was afraid to speak or move.</t239> <t240>As we continued on our path, which was plunged into complete darkness because the rolling clouds hid the moon, time seemed to stand still.</t240> <t241>We kept climbing; although there were occasional steep descents, we were mostly ascending.</t241> <t242>Suddenly, I became aware of the fact that the driver was stopping the horses in the courtyard of a very large and ruined castle, whose high, dark windows let in no light and whose broken battlements formed a jagged line against the moonlit sky.</t242>
<t243>II</t243>
<t244>Jonathan Harker's journal (continued)</t244>
<t245>May 5.</t245> <t246>- I must have fallen asleep because if I were fully awake, I would have noticed approaching such a remarkable place.</t246> <t247>In the dark, the courtyard appeared considerably wide, and it might have seemed larger than it actually was because many dark paths opened under the large, round arches.</t247> <t248>I have not yet seen the courtyard in daylight.</t248>
<t249>When the car stopped, the driver jumped down and extended his hand to help me get out.</t249> <t250>Once again, I couldn't help but notice his tremendous strength.</t250> <t251>Honestly, his hand was like a steel clamp that could crush mine if he wanted to.</t251> <t252>Then, he took my suitcases out of the car and placed them beside me on the ground as I stood by the large door located at the protruding entrance made of old, iron-nailed, and magnificent stone.</t252> <t253>Even in the dim light, I could see that the stone was impressively adorned with carvings, but it had been quite worn down by time and weather.</t253> <t254>As I stood there, the driver jumped back into his seat and shook the reins; the horses set off and, along with the car, disappeared into one of the dark gates.</t254>
<t255>I stood silently where I was, because I didn't know what to do.</t255> <t256>There wasn't a single trace of a bell or door knocker around; it was unlikely that my voice would pierce through these frowning walls and dark window gaps.</t256> <t257>The time I spent waiting seemed endless, and I felt doubts and fears swarming over me.</t257> <t258>What kind of place had I come to, what kind of people was I among?</t258> <t259>What a dreadful adventure had I embarked upon?</t259> <t260>Was this a usual event in the life of a solicitor's clerk sent to explain the purchase of a property in London to a foreigner?</t260> <t261>Solicitor's clerk!</t261> <t262>Mina would not have liked this at all.</t262> <t263>Solicitor, because I had learned that I had passed the exam just before leaving London; but was I now truly a solicitor?</t263> <t264>I began to rub my eyes and pinch myself to see if I was awake.</t264> <t265>All of this seemed like a terrible nightmare to me, and just like after a day when I had overworked, I hoped to suddenly wake up and find myself at home with the dawn trying to enter through the window.</t265> <t266>But my body responded to the pinching test, and my eyes were not deceiving me.</t266> <t267>I was indeed awake and in the Carpathian Mountains.</t267> <t268>Now, all I had to do was be patient and wait for the morning to come.</t268>
<t269>Just as I had reached this conclusion, I heard the sound of heavy footsteps approaching from behind the large door and saw the glimmer of light coming through the cracks.</t269> <t270>Then came the sound of clinking chains and bolts being drawn.</t270> <t271>With a creak caused by long disuse, a key turned in the lock and the large door opened inward.</t271>
<t272>Inside, a tall, elderly man was standing; apart from his long white mustache, he was clean-shaven and dressed entirely in black without a hint of color.</t272> <t273>He was holding an antique silver lamp; although it had neither a lamp chimney nor a globe, a flame was burning inside it, and as the flame flickered in the draft from the open door, it cast long, trembling shadows.</t273> <t274>With a rather respectful gesture of his right hand, he invited me in and said in a peculiar intonation, yet in perfect English:</t274>
<t275>"Welcome to my home!</t275> <t276>Enter freely and of your own will!" He did not make the slightest move to greet me; he stood like a statue, as if the act of welcoming had turned him to stone.</t276> <t277>However, the moment I crossed the threshold, he suddenly lunged forward and extended his hand, gripping mine with a force that made me want to pull back - so much so that this effect was not diminished in the least by the fact that his hand was ice-cold.</t277> <t278>He then said again:</t278>
<t279>“Welcome to my home.</t279> <t280>Enter freely.</t280> <t281>Go freely and leave behind some of the happiness you bring!” The strength in the handshake was so similar to that of the driver whose face I had not seen that I doubted for a moment whether I was speaking to the same person; therefore, to be sure, I asked questioningly, “Count Dracula?”</t281> <t282>He bowed respectfully as he replied:</t282>
<t283>“Dracula says, welcome to my home and to you, Mr. Harker.</t283> <t284>Come inside; the night air is cold; you must need something to eat and rest.”</t284> <t285>As he spoke, he placed the lamp on a shelf on the wall and went outside to get my luggage; before I could act quickly and stop him, he had already carried my luggage inside.</t285> <t286>I objected but he insisted:</t286>
<t287>“No, sir, you are my guest.</t287> <t288>It is late and my men are not here.</t288> <t289>Allow me to ensure your comfort myself.”</t289> <t290>He insisted on carrying my belongings along the corridor and then through another wide corridor where our footsteps echoed loudly on the grand spiral staircase and stone floor.</t290> <t291>At the end of this corridor, he opened a heavy door, and I was very pleased to see that a table was set for dinner inside and large logs were blazing in the magnificent fireplace.</t291>
<t292>The Count put my bags down, closed the door, and walked to the other end of the room, opening another door that led to a small, octagonal room illuminated by a single lamp and seemingly devoid of any windows.</t292> <t293>He passed through this door, opened another one, and gestured for me to enter with his hand.</t293> <t294>It was a pleasant sight; for here, there was a large bedroom well-lit and warmed by logs in a wide fireplace that seemed to roar with flames.</t294> <t295>The Count placed my suitcases inside and stepped back; before closing the door, he said:</t295>
<t296>“After your journey, you need to refresh yourself by changing your clothes.</t296> <t297>I believe you will find everything you desire.</t297> <t298>When you are ready, come to the other room where you will find your meal prepared.</t298><t299>”</t299>
<t300>The brightness, warmth, and the Count's refined welcome seemed to have dispelled all my doubts and fears.</t300> <t301>When I returned to my usual state of mind, I realized that I was almost fainting from hunger; so I quickly got dressed and went to the other room.</t301>
<t302>I saw that the meal had already been prepared.</t302> <t303>My host, standing by the stone carvings of the large fireplace, made a slight hand gesture towards the table and said:</t303>
<t304>“Please sit down and eat as you wish.</t304> <t305>I hope you won't mind that I am not joining you; I have already had my dinner and do not eat at this late hour.</t305><t306>”</t306>
<t307>I handed the sealed letter entrusted to me by Mr. Hawkins to the Count.</t307> <t308>He opened the letter and read it with a serious expression; then, with a pleasant smile, he handed it to me to read.</t308> <t309>At least one paragraph gave me a joyful excitement:</t309>
<t310>I am deeply saddened that the recurrence of gout, a chronic ailment I suffer from, has definitively prevented me from traveling for a while; however, I am pleased to say that I have been able to send someone in my place whom I trust in every possible way and who is highly qualified.</t310> <t311>A young man with his own unique energy and talent, possessing an honest nature.</t311> <t312>He is discreet and quiet, and has been trained in my service.</t312> <t313>During his stay with you, he will be ready to accompany you whenever you wish and will take your instructions in all matters.</t313>
<t314>The Count personally stepped forward, lifted the lid off one of the dishes, and immediately, I began to eat a perfectly roasted chicken.</t314> <t315>My meal consisted of this chicken, some cheese, salad, and a bottle of old Tokay from which I drank two glasses.</t315> <t316>While I was eating, the Count asked many questions about my journey, and I gradually recounted my experiences to him.</t316>
<t317>During this time, I had finished my meal, and at the request of my host, I pulled a chair up to the fire and began to smoke a cigar he offered, apologizing for not joining me.</t317> <t318>Now I had the opportunity to observe him, and I saw that he had quite a remarkable physiognomy.</t318>
<t319>His face, with the high arch of his thin nose and unusually curved nostrils, high-domed forehead, and hair sparse at the temples but plentiful elsewhere, resembled a strong - very strong - eagle.</t319> <t320>His eyebrows were so thick that they almost met above his nose, and they seemed to curl within their own abundance.</t320> <t321>As far as I could see from under his thick mustache, his mouth appeared stern and quite cruel with unusually sharp white teeth; the teeth extended over lips that showed a surprising sign of life for a man of his age, being a vivid red.</t321> <t322>As for the rest; his ears were pale and excessively pointed at the tops; his chin was broad and strong, and his cheeks, though thin, were firm.</t322> <t323>The overall effect he created was one of extraordinary pallor.</t323>
<t324>Until then, I had noticed the backs of his hands under the light cast by the fire, they looked quite white and beautiful; but now, seeing them up close, I couldn't help but notice how coarse they were - they had stubby fingers and were broad.</t324> <t325>Strangely enough, there was hair in the middle of his palm.</t325> <t326>His nails were long and thin, and their tips were sharply cut.</t326> <t327>I couldn't help but shudder when the Count leaned over and touched me with his hands.</t327> <t328>It might have been because his breath smelled, but I was suffering from a terrible nausea that I couldn't hide no matter what I did.</t328> <t329>Clearly noticing this, the Count withdrew; with a cruel smile that showed his protruding teeth more than ever before, he sat down on the other side of the fireplace once again.</t329> <t330>For a while, we both remained silent; when I looked out the window, I saw the first pale signs of the approaching dawn.</t330> <t331>It seemed as if a strange calm had settled over everything; but when I listened closely, I heard the howling of many wolves, seemingly coming from down the valley.</t331> <t332>The Count's eyes gleamed and he said:</t332>
<t333>“Listen to them - the children of the night.</t333> <t334>What music they make!" I think he saw a strange expression on my face, so he added:</t334>
<t335>“Ah, sir, you city folks cannot understand the feelings of a hunter.”</t335> <t336>Then he stood up and said:</t336>
<t337>“But you must be tired.</t337> <t338>Your room is ready and you can sleep as long as you want tomorrow.</t338> <t339>I need to be outside until the afternoon; so sleep well and have sweet dreams!” And with a respectful bow, he opened the door of the octagonal room for me, I entered my room...</t339>
<t340>I am completely in a sea of bewilderment.</t340> <t341>I have doubts; I am afraid; I am thinking of strange things that I do not even have the courage to reveal to my own soul.</t341> <t342>My God, protect me, if only for the sake of my loved ones!</t342>
<t343>May 7.</t343> <t344>- It's early morning again, but I am rested and have enjoyed the last twenty-four hours.</t344> <t345>I slept until late in the day and woke up whenever I wanted.</t345> <t346>When I got dressed, I went to the room where we had dinner and saw that a cold breakfast was ready with coffee kept warm by a pot left on the fire.</t346> <t347>There was a card on the table with the following written on it:</t347>
<t348>I won't be around here for a while.</t348> <t349>Don't wait for me.</t349> <t350>- D.</t350>
<t351>Thus, I began to eat and enjoyed the taste of a hearty meal.</t351> <t352>When I finished my meal, I looked for a bell to inform the servants that I was done; but I couldn't find one.</t352> <t353>Considering the extraordinary displays of wealth around me, there were undoubtedly strange deficiencies in the house.</t353> <t354>The tableware was made of gold and so beautifully crafted that it must be of immense value.</t354> <t355>The curtains on the windows, the upholstery of the chairs and sofas, and the drapes surrounding my bed were made of the most expensive and beautiful fabrics; they must have been of tremendous value when produced, because despite being in perfect condition, they were undoubtedly centuries old.</t355> <t356>I had seen something similar at Hampton Court Palace, but they were worn, frayed, and moth-eaten.</t356> <t357>Yet, there were no mirrors in any room.</t357> <t358>There wasn't even a dressing mirror on my table, and before shaving or brushing my hair, I had to take out the small shaving mirror from my bag.</t358> <t359>I have not seen any servants anywhere nor heard any sound near the castle except for the howling of wolves.</t359> <t360>When I finished my meal - I don't know whether to call it breakfast or dinner, as it was between five and six o'clock when I ate - I looked for something to read, as I did not want to explore the castle without the Count's permission.</t360> <t361>There was absolutely nothing in the room; no books, no newspapers, not even writing materials; so I opened another door in the room and found a sort of library.</t361> <t362>I tried the door opposite mine but found it was locked.</t362>
<t363>In the library, with joy, I found a large number of English books; all the shelves were filled with these books, and there were bound magazines and newspapers.</t363> <t364>English magazines and newspapers were scattered on a table in the middle, but none of them were recent.</t364> <t365>The books were of very different genres - history, geography, politics, economic policy, botany, geology, law - all about England and the English lifestyle, traditions, and customs.</t365> <t366>There were even reference sources like the "London Guide", the "Red" and "Blue" books, the "Whitaker Almanac", the "Army and Navy Lists" - which somehow delighted me upon seeing - and the "Law List".</t366>
<t367>While I was looking at the books, the door opened and the Count entered.</t367> <t368>He greeted me warmly and, after saying he hoped I had rested well during the night, he continued:</t368>
<t369>“I am glad you found your way here, because I am sure there are many things here that will interest you.</t369> <t370>These friends,” -he placed his hand on some books- “have been my good companions, and over the past few years, since I decided to go to London, they have given me many, many pleasant hours.</t370> <t371>Through them, I have come to know your great England; to know it is to love it.</t371> <t372>I am eager to walk through the crowded streets of your dear London, to stand amidst the hustle and bustle of humanity, to share in the city's life, its changes, its death, and everything that makes it what it is.</t372> <t373>But alas!</t373> <t374>I know your language only through books.</t374> <t375>I rely on you, my friend, to speak this language.</t375><t376>”</t376>
<t377>"But Mr. Kant," I said, "you know and speak English perfectly!" He nodded solemnly.</t377>
<t378>“Thank you for your flattering compliment, my friend, but I am afraid I am still at the very beginning of the journey I must undertake.</t378> <t379>Yes, it is true that I know the grammar and the words, but I still do not know how to pronounce them.</t379><t380>”</t380>
<t381>“Indeed,” I said, “you pronounce it perfectly.</t381><t382>”</t382>
<t383>“It is not so,” he replied.</t383> <t384>“Yes, I know that if I moved to your London and spoke there, no one would fail to understand that I am a foreigner.</t384> <t385>That is not enough for me.</t385> <t386>Here I am noble; I am a boyar, ordinary people know me, and I am a master.</t386> <t387>But in a foreign country, a foreigner is nobody; people do not know him, and not knowing is not caring.</t387> <t388>If I am like the others, that is, if no one stops to look at me or, in the middle of a conversation, upon hearing my words, stops to say, ‘Ha, ha! A foreigner!,’ I would be content with that.</t388> <t389>I have been a master for a long time, and I will continue to be a master, or at least no one else should be my master.</t389> <t390>You did not come here merely to talk about my new property in London as an agent of my friend Peter Hawkins of Exeter.</t390> <t391>I hope you will stay with me for a while, so that through our conversations I can learn the English accent; I ask you to tell me when I make a mistake during my speech - even the slightest mistake.</t391> <t392>I apologize for having to be away for so long today; but I know you will forgive someone who has so many important matters at hand.</t392><t393>”</t393>
<t394>Of course, I said everything I could say about being willing to do this and asked if I could go to that room whenever I wanted.</t394> <t395>"Yes, of course," he replied and added:</t395>
<t396>“You can go anywhere you want in the castle; except for the places where the doors are locked and, of course, the places you wouldn't want to go.</t396> <t397>There is a reason why everything is the way it is right now, and if you saw and knew what I know, you might understand better.”</t397> <t398>I said that I was sure of this.</t398> <t399>He then continued his words:</t399>
<t400>“We are in Transylvania, and Transylvania is not England.</t400> <t401>Our ways are not your ways, and many things will seem strange to you.</t401> <t402>No, based on the experiences you have told me about, you know something about the strange things that can happen here.</t402><t403>”</t403>
<t404>This led to quite a bit of conversation, and since it was clear that he wanted to talk, even if just for the sake of talking, I asked him many questions about the things that had happened to me and the things I had noticed so far.</t404><t405>Sometimes he diverted the topic or pretended not to understand and changed the subject; but generally, he answered everything I asked honestly.</t405><t406>Then, as time passed and I somehow became more courageous, I asked about some of the strange events of the previous night, for example, why the coachman went to the places where we saw the blue flames.</t406><t407>Was it true that these flames indicated where the gold was hidden?</t407><t408>Then the Count explained to me that according to a widespread belief, on a certain night of the year - actually, last night when supposedly all evil spirits roamed freely - a blue flame is believed to appear over any place where treasure is hidden.</t408><t409>“There is almost no doubt,” he continued, “that treasure is hidden in the area you passed through last night, because those are the lands that have been fought over for centuries by the Vlachs, Saxons, and Turks.</t409><t410>There is not a single handful of soil in this entire region that has not been enriched by the blood of either patriots or invaders.</t410><t411>In the old days, there were exciting times when Austrians and Hungarians invaded in hordes, and patriots - men, women, young, old - went out to resist them and waited at the tops of the rocks above the passes so they could crush and destroy them with artificial avalanches.</t411><t412>When the invaders won, they found very little, because everything that existed there had been hidden in the friendly soil.</t412><t413>”</t413>
<t414>"Ama," I said, "how could it have remained undiscovered for so long when there is such clear evidence that people would see if they took the trouble to look?"</t414> <t415>The Count laughed, and as his lips drew back from his gums, his long, sharp canine teeth appeared in a strange manner; he answered my question as follows:</t415>
<t416>“Because your villager is actually cowardly and stupid!</t416> <t417>Those flames appear only one night.</t417> <t418>And on that night, no one in this country, if they can help it, steps outside their home.</t418> <t419>And sir, if they do step out, they wouldn't know what to do.</t419> <t420>Even the villager who said the flame marked the spot wouldn't know where to look for his own mark in daylight.</t420> <t421>I'll bet you wouldn't be able to find those places again either, would you?</t421><t422>”</t422>
<t423>“You are right about this,” I said.</t423> <t424>“I don't know where to look for them any more than the dead do.”</t424> <t425>Then we delved into other topics.</t425>
<t426>“Come,” he said at last, “tell me about London and the house you found for me.”</t426> <t427>Apologizing for my negligence, I went to my room to fetch the papers from my bag.</t427> <t428>As I was arranging the papers, I heard the clinking of porcelain and silver from the next room, and as I passed by, I noticed that the table was being cleared and the lamp was being lit; for it had grown quite dark by then.</t428> <t429>Lamps had also been lit in the room that served as a study or library, and I found the Count lying on the sofa, reading an English Bradshaw Guide among all the things in the world.</t429> <t430>When I entered, he cleared the books and papers from the table; together, we delved into all sorts of plans, deeds, and accounts.</t430> <t431>He was interested in everything and asked me thousands of questions about the place and its surroundings.</t431> <t432>It was clear that he had already examined everything he could find about the surroundings, for in the end, it was evident that he knew much more than I did.</t432> <t433>When I said this, he replied:</t433>
<t434>“Well, but my friend, shouldn't it be that way?</t434> <t435>When I go there, I will be alone, and my friend Harker Jonathan -no, pardon me, I have the habit of putting the surname first in my country- my friend Jonathan Harker will not be there to correct and guide me.</t435> <t436>Miles away, in Exeter, he will most likely be working on legal documents with my other friend Peter Hawkins.</t436> <t437>That's why!</t437><t438>”</t438>
<t439>We thoroughly examined the matters related to the purchase of the property in Purfleet.</t439> <t440>After explaining its qualities to him, having him sign the necessary documents, and writing a letter ready to be sent to Mr. Hawkins along with the documents, he began to ask how such a suitable place came to my attention.</t440> <t441>I read to him the notes I had taken at the time and written here:</t441>
<t442>“In Purfleet, I came across a place on a side road that resembled what I was looking for and had a dilapidated sign indicating it was for sale.</t442> <t443>It was an old structure, built with heavy stones and surrounded by a high wall that hadn't seen any repairs for many years.</t443> <t444>The closed doors were made of heavy old oak and entirely worn out by rust.</t444>
<t445>The name of the mansion is Carfax; undoubtedly, it is a corrupted form of the old Quatre Face because the building is four-cornered, aligned with the four cardinal points of the compass.</t445><t446>In total, it consists of an eight-hectare area surrounded by the aforementioned massive stone wall.</t446><t447>There are numerous trees and a body of water that make the area dim in some places. The water is both clean and flows in a medium-sized stream, indicating that it is fed by a source, forming a deep and dark-looking pond or small lake.</t447><t448>The house is quite large and I can say that its history dates back to the Middle Ages, because one side is made of extremely thick stone, has few windows high up, and the windows are covered with tight iron bars.</t448><t449>It looks like a part of an inner castle and is very close to an old chapel or church.</t449><t450>I couldn't enter it because I didn't have the key to the door leading there from the house, but I took pictures of it from different angles with my Kodak.</t450><t451>Additions have been made to the house, but these were done very haphazardly, and I can only estimate the area it covers - which must be quite large.</t451><t452>There are only a few houses nearby; one of them is a very large house that has recently been converted into a private mental hospital with various additions.</t452><t453>However, it is not visible from the mansion.</t453><t454>”</t454>
<t455>When I finished, the Count said:</t455>
<t456>"I'm glad it is old and large.</t456> <t457>Personally, I come from an old family, and living in a new house would kill me.</t457> <t458>A house cannot be made livable in a day, and already how few days are needed for a century.</t458> <t459>I'm also very glad that there is an old chapel from ancient times.</t459> <t460>We Transylvanian nobles love to think that our bones will not be among the common dead.</t460> <t461>I'm not after entertainment, joy, or the bright sensuality of daylight and sparkling waters that please the young and cheerful.</t461> <t462>I'm no longer young, and my heart cannot keep up with joy due to the weary years spent mourning the dead.</t462> <t463>Moreover, the walls of my castle are crumbling; the number of shadows is many, and the wind blows coldly through the broken battlements and windows.</t463> <t464>I love shadowy places and shadows, and I prefer to be alone with my thoughts as much as possible.</t464><t465>"</t465>
<t466>In some way, his words and glances did not seem to match, or the expression on his face might have caused his smile to appear malevolent and cold.</t466>
<t467>Immediately, he left my side with an excuse and asked me to gather all my documents as he was leaving.</t467> <t468>After he left the room and quite some time had passed, I started to look at some books around me.</t468> <t469>One of them was an atlas that, as if frequently used, naturally opened to England.</t469> <t470>When I looked at the map, I saw that certain places were circled and upon examining these marks, I realized that one of them was at a point near the east side of London, clearly where his new property was located; the other two were in Exeter and Whitby on the Yorkshire coast.</t470>
<t471>When the Count returned, half an hour had passed.</t471> <t472>“Aha!” he said, “Are you still with your books?</t472> <t473>Good! But you must not work all the time.</t473> <t474>Come; it was said that your dinner is ready.”</t474> <t475>He took me by the arm and we went to the next room where a perfect dinner was ready on the table.</t475> <t476>The Count once again excused himself, saying that he had eaten while he was out.</t476> <t477>But like the previous night, he sat and chatted with me while I ate my meal.</t477> <t478>After dinner, just like the previous night, I smoked a cigar, and the Count stayed with me for hours, chatting and asking questions on all possible topics.</t478> <t479>I felt that it was really late, but I said nothing because I felt I had to fulfill my host's wishes in every aspect.</t479> <t480>Since the long sleep from the previous day had refreshed me, I was not sleepy; but I couldn't help feeling the chill that comes at dawn and resembles the change in tide.</t480> <t481>They say that people close to death often die at dawn or when the tide changes, and anyone who is tired and remains on duty to experience this change can believe this view.</t481> <t482>In the clean morning air, we suddenly heard a rooster crow with an unusual sharpness; Count Dracula, who jumped to his feet, said:</t482>
<t483>“Yaa! It's morning again!</t483> <t484>How careless of me to keep you up for so long.</t484> <t485>To ensure I don't lose track of time, you should make your conversations about my dear new homeland, England, less captivating.”</t485> <t486>After saying this, he respectfully bowed and left my side.</t486>
<t487>I went to my room and drew the curtains, but there was very little to catch the eye; my window opened to the courtyard, and the only thing I could see was the warm grayness of the illuminated sky.</t487> <t488>So I drew the curtains once more and wrote down what happened today.</t488>
<t489>8 May.</t489> <t490>- I have started to worry that I am getting too distracted while writing in this notebook; but now I am glad that I have gone into details from the beginning, because there is something so strange about this place that I cannot help but feel anxious while I am here.</t490> <t491>I wish I had left here safely or never come at all.</t491> <t492>This strange nocturnal life might be affecting me badly; but I wish that was all!</t492> <t493>If there was someone I could talk to, I could endure it, but there is no one.</t493> <t494>I can only talk to the Count!</t494> <t495>- I am afraid I am the only living being here.</t495> <t496>I must be as ordinary as the facts; this will help me endure; my imagination must not find an empty field and rise up against me.</t496> <t497>If it does, I will be ruined.</t497> <t498>Let me immediately explain how I endure or seem to endure.</t498>
<t499>When I went to bed, I could only sleep for a few hours and got up feeling that I couldn't sleep any longer.</t499> <t500>I had hung my shaving mirror on the window and was about to start shaving.</t500> <t501>Suddenly, I felt a hand on my shoulder and heard the Count's voice saying, "Good morning."</t501> <t502>I was startled because I hadn't seen him, as the reflection in the mirror covered the entire room behind me.</t502> <t503>When I was startled, I slightly cut my face, but I didn't realize it at that moment.</t503> <t504>I responded to the Count's greeting and turned back to the mirror to see how I had been mistaken.</t504> <t505>This time, there could be no mistake because the man was close to me and I could see him over my shoulder.</t505> <t506>But there was no reflection of him in the mirror!</t506> <t507>The entire room behind me was visible; but there was no sign of anyone else besides myself.</t507> <t508>This situation was frightening, and piling on top of so many strange things, the vague unease I always felt when the Count was near began to increase, but just then I saw that the cut was bleeding slightly; the blood was running down to my chin.</t508> <t509>I slightly turned to look for a bandage and put down the razor.</t509> <t510>When he saw my face, the Count's eyes gleamed with a demonic rage, and suddenly he grabbed my throat.</t510> <t511>I quickly pulled back and, well, touched the string of the rosary holding the cross.</t511> <t512>This caused an abrupt change in him; his anger passed so quickly that I could barely believe it had existed before.</t512>
<t513>“Be careful,” he said, “be careful how you cut yourself.</t513> <t514>This situation is more dangerous in this country than you think.”</t514> <t515>Then, taking the shaving mirror in his hand, he continued: “And here is the pitiable thing that causes harm.</t515> <t516>The disgusting and meaningless ornament of human arrogance.</t516> <t517>Throw it away,” he said, opening the heavy window with a single stroke of his terrible hand and hurling the mirror outside; the mirror shattered into a thousand pieces on the stone floor of the courtyard below.</t517> <t518>Then, without saying a word, he left the room.</t518> <t519>This is very frustrating, because if it weren't for the protective cover of my watch or the bottom of my shaving bowl, which luckily is metal, I don't know how I would shave.</t519>
<t520>When I went to the dining room, breakfast was ready; but I couldn't find the Count anywhere.</t520> <t521>Therefore, I had my breakfast alone.</t521> <t522>It's strange that I haven't seen the Count eating or drinking anything so far.</t522> <t523>He must be someone out of the ordinary!</t523> <t524>After breakfast, I went on a small exploration of the castle.</t524> <t525>I climbed the stairs and found a room facing south.</t525> <t526>The view was magnificent and offered every opportunity to see it from where I stood.</t526> <t527>The castle was on the edge of a terrifying cliff.</t527> <t528>A stone dropped from the window could fall three hundred meters without hitting anything!</t528> <t529>In the distance, as far as the eye could see, there was a sea of green treetops; occasionally, there were deep ravines where the cliff was.</t529> <t530>Among them, silvery lines stretched where the river wound through deep passes in the forest.</t530>
<t531>But I am not in the mood to describe the beauty, because after watching the scenery, I did some more exploration; doors, doors, everywhere doors and all of them locked and bolted.</t531> <t532>On the castle walls, there is no proper exit except for the windows.</t532>
<t533>The castle is a complete prison, and I am a prisoner!</t533>
<t534>III</t534>
<t535>Jonathan Harker's journal (continued)</t535>
<t536>I was almost out of my mind when I realized I was a prisoner.</t536><t537>I frantically tried every door I could find and looked out of every window, running up and down the stairs; but soon my belief in my helplessness overshadowed everything else.</t537><t538>Looking back a few hours later, I think I must have lost my mind for a short time, because I was acting like a trapped rat.</t538><t539>But when I concluded that I was helpless, I sat down quietly -more quietly than I had ever done in my life- and began to think about what the best course of action would be.</t539><t540>I am still thinking and have not yet come to a definite decision.</t540><t541>I am sure of only one thing: There is no point in explaining my thoughts to the Count.</t541><t542>He knows very well that I am imprisoned here; since he is the one who did it and undoubtedly has his reasons for it, if I trust him with these facts, he will only deceive me.</t542><t543>As far as I can see, my only plan is to keep what I know and fear to myself and stay alert.</t543><t544>I know that either I am being fooled like a baby by my own fears, or I am in a terrible predicament; if it is the latter, I need all my wits and will need them in the future as well.</t544><t545>I had barely come to this decision when I heard the great door below close and realized that the Count had returned.</t545><t546>He did not come to the library immediately, so I carefully went to my own room and found him making the bed.</t546><t547>This was a strange situation, but it confirmed what I had thought from the beginning, that there were no servants in the house.</t547><t548>Later, when I saw him setting the table in the dining room through the crack in the door hinge, I became even more certain; if he was doing all these servant tasks himself, it was proof that there was no one else to do them.</t548><t549>This situation frightened me, because if there was no one else in the castle, the driver of the carriage that brought me here must also have been the Count himself.</t549><t550>This is a terrifying thought; because if so, what does it mean that he could control the wolves by silently raising his hand?</t550><t551>How was it that everyone in Bistriţa and in the carriage was afraid for me?</t551><t552>What did it mean to be given a cross, garlic, wild rose, and rowan?</t552><t553>God bless the good woman who hung the cross around my neck, for every time I touch it, it gives me peace and strength.</t553><t554>How strange that something I was taught to approach with disapproval and see as idolatry is helping me in a time of loneliness and trouble.</t554><t555>Is there something in the nature of this object, or is it a tangible aid that carries memories of love and peace?</t555><t556>If possible, I must investigate this matter and come to a conclusion about it someday.</t556><t557>In the meantime, I must learn everything I can about Count Dracula, as it may help me understand what is happening.</t557><t558>Tonight, if I steer the conversation that way, he might talk about himself.</t558><t559>But I must be very careful not to arouse suspicion.</t559>
<t560>Midnight.</t560> <t561>- I had a long conversation with the Count.</t561> <t562>I asked him a few questions about the history of Transylvania, and he was filled with impeccable enthusiasm on the subject.</t562> <t563>When he spoke of events and people, but especially of wars, he talked as if he had been part of them all.</t563> <t564>Later, while explaining this, he said that for a boyar, the pride of his house and name is his own pride, their glory is his own glory, and their fate is his own fate.</t564> <t565>Whenever he spoke of his house, he always said "we," and he always spoke in the plural as if a king were speaking.</t565> <t566>I wish I could have recorded his words exactly as he expressed them, because it was utterly fascinating to me.</t566> <t567>What he narrated seemed to encompass the entire history of the country.</t567> <t568>As he spoke, his excitement grew, and he wandered around the room, tugging at his large white mustache and grasping everything in his path as if he would crush it with great force.</t568> <t569>Since he told the story of his race in his unique way, I will put down some of his words as close to the original as possible:</t569>
<t570>“We Seklers have the right to be proud, because in our veins flows the blood of many brave races who fought like lions for mastery.</t570> <t571>The Finno-Ugric peoples brought the warrior spirit from Iceland to here, into the whirlpool of European races, given to them by Thor and Odin, and demonstrated with a terror that created the impression that werewolves had arrived in the coastal regions of Europe, yes, and also in the coastal regions of Asia and Africa.</t571> <t572>When they arrived here, they found the Huns, who swept across the earth like a living flame with their warrior fury, making the dying people think that the blood of those ancient witches, driven from Scythian lands and mating with desert demons, flowed in their veins.</t572> <t573>Fools! Fools! What devil or witch could be as great as Attila, whose blood flows in these veins?”</t573> <t574>He raised his arms.</t574> <t575>“Is it surprising that we are a conquering race; that we are proud; that when the Hungarians, Lombards, Avars, Bulgars, or Turks poured thousands into our borders, we repelled them?</t575> <t576>Is it strange that when Árpád and his forces swept through the homeland of the Hungarians and reached the border, they found us here, completing the Honfoglalás here?</t576> <t577>And when the Hungarian incursion swept eastward, the Seklers were considered relatives of the victorious Hungarians, and for centuries, the task of guarding the border of the Turkish country was entrusted to us; yes, and beyond that, the eternal duty of border protection - for, as the Turks say, ‘Water sleeps, the enemy does not’ - which of the ‘Four Nations’ that make up Transylvania took the ‘bloody sword’ with greater satisfaction than us, or who gathered under the King’s banner more quickly when the call to arms was made?</t577> <t578>When was the great shame of my nation, the shame of Kosovo, when the flags of the Vlachs and Hungarians remained under the Crescent, ever compensated?</t578> <t579>Was it not one of my race, as Voivode, who crossed the Danube and defeated the Turks in their own lands?</t579> <t580>He was indeed a Dracula!</t580> <t581>Shame on his worthless brother who, when defeated, sold his people to the Turks and subjected them to the shame of captivity!</t581> <t582>Indeed, was it not this Dracula who inspired another member of his race in later centuries to repeatedly cross the great river with his forces into Turkish lands; or, when repelled, to emerge again, again, and again, even if he alone survived the bloody battlefield where his troops were slaughtered, knowing he could achieve absolute victory alone?</t582> <t583>They said he thought only of himself.</t583> <t584>Pah! What use are peasants without their leaders?</t584> <t585>Where does war end without a brain and heart to lead?</t585> <t586>Again, after the Battle of Mohács, it was we who threw off the Hungarian yoke; we, those descended from Dracula’s blood, were among the leaders, because our spirit could not endure being unfree.</t586> <t587>Ah! Young gentleman, the Seklers - and the Draculas as the blood, brains, and swords of their hearts - can boast of a kind of fame that the mushroom-like Habsburgs and Romanovs could never possess.</t587> <t588>The days of war are over.</t588> <t589>In these disgraceful days of peace, blood is far too precious a thing, and the glories of great races are like tales told.</t589><t590>"</t590>
<t591>It was almost morning, and we went to bed.</t591> <t592>(Note: This diary is starting to resemble the beginning of One Thousand and One Nights quite badly, as everything has to be interrupted by the crowing of a rooster - or it resembles the ghost of Hamlet's father.</t592><t593>)</t593>
<t594>May 12.</t594> <t595>-Let me begin with facts- simple, insufficient, and undeniable facts verified by books and numbers.</t595> <t596>I must mix them with my own experiences that should remain in my observations and memories about them.</t596> <t597>Last night, when the Count left his room, he started by asking me questions about legal matters and how certain tasks should be done.</t597> <t598>I spent the day buried in books, tired and weary, and just to distract my mind, I went over some topics I had studied at Lincoln's Inn.</t598> <t599>There was a certain method in the Count's research; therefore, I must try to note them in a particular order; this information might be useful to me in some way or at some point.</t599>
<t600>First, he asked whether a person in England could have two or more legal advisors.</t600> <t601>I told him that if he wished, he could retain a dozen, but it would not be wise to appoint more than one legal advisor for a single transaction, as only one could act at a time and changing this situation would not be in his best interest.</t601> <t602>He seemed to understand the situation deeply and continued the conversation by asking whether it would cause practical difficulties to appoint another person, for example, to handle transportation matters if his advisor dealing with banking needed local assistance for a job in another country.</t602> <t603>To avoid misleading him in any way, I asked him to explain in more detail, and he said:</t603>
<t604>“Let me give you an example.</t604> <t605>Our mutual friend Mr. Peter Hawkins, from the shadow of your beautiful cathedral in Exeter, which is quite far from London, is purchasing my house in London through your trustworthy person.</t605> <t606>Good! So that you do not think it strange that I seek the services of someone so far away instead of someone living in London, I must clearly state here that my reason was to avoid serving any local interest other than my own; someone living in London might aim to serve themselves or a friend, so I sought a representative who would work solely for my benefit.</t606> <t607>Now, let's assume that I, being very busy, wanted to ship goods by sea to, say, Newcastle, Durham, Harwich, or Dover. Wouldn't it be easier to entrust the task to someone at those ports?”</t607> <t608>I said that it would undoubtedly be easier, but we legal advisors have a proxy system, so local matters can be handled locally with an instruction from any legal advisor, allowing the client to have their desires fulfilled without facing more issues by placing themselves in the hands of a single person.</t608>
<t609>“But,” he said, “I can be free to manage my own affairs.</t609> <t610>Isn't that right?</t610><t611>”</t611>
<t612>“Of course,” I replied; “businessmen who do not want any of their affairs to be learned by anyone often resort to this method.</t612><t613>”</t613>
<t614>“Beautiful!” he said and continued asking questions about ways to make deliveries, the routes to follow, and any difficulties that could be prevented by taking precautions.</t614> <t615>I explained all of this to him as best as I could, and he gave me the impression that he could be an excellent legal advisor, because there wasn't a single thing he hadn't thought of or foreseen beforehand.</t615> <t616>For someone who had never been in the country and clearly hadn't been much involved in business, his knowledge and intelligence were excellent.</t616> <t617>After satisfying himself on these points and after I had verified everything as best as I could through the available books, he suddenly stood up and said: “Since the first letter you wrote to our friend Mr. Peter Hawkins, have you written to him or anyone else?”</t617> <t618>With a bit of unease in my heart, I said that I hadn't, that I hadn't yet had the opportunity to send a letter to anyone.</t618>
<t619>“Then write now, my young friend,” he said, placing his heavy hand on my shoulder.</t619> <t620>“Write to our friend and others, and if you like, tell them you will stay with me for another month.”</t620> <t621>“Do you want me to stay that long?” I asked, for my heart had frozen at the thought.</t621>
<t622>“I want it very much; no, I do not accept objections.</t622> <t623>Your master, your employer, however you call him, it was understood that only my needs would be considered when someone was decided to replace him.</t623> <t624>I did not spare any expense.</t624> <t625>Isn't that so?</t625><t626>”</t626>
<t627>What else could I do but accept this situation and submit?</t627> <t628>The matter at hand was not my interest but Mr. Hawkins', and I had to think of him, not myself; besides, there was something in Count Dracula's eyes and behavior that reminded me I was a prisoner and suggested that I had no other choice even if I wanted one.</t628> <t629>The Count saw his triumph in my submission and his dominance in my unease, for he immediately began to use these with his own soft and yielding manner: "I beg you, my dear young friend, do not speak of matters other than business in your letters.</t629> <t630>Surely, your friends will be pleased to learn that you are well and eagerly awaiting your return to them.</t630> <t631>Isn't that so?"</t631> <t632>As he said this, he handed me three sheets of letter paper and three envelopes.</t632> <t633>They were all of the finest kind used in overseas mail, and when I looked at the papers and then at the Count, I noticed him silently smiling with his sharp canine tooth protruding over his red lower lip, as if to say aloud that I should be careful about what I wrote because he could read it.</t633> <t634>Therefore, I decided to write only formal letters for now but to secretly write everything to Mr. Hawkins and Mina—because I could write to her in shorthand, which would confuse the Count if he saw the letter.</t634> <t635>After writing my two letters, I sat quietly reading a book; meanwhile, the Count wrote a few notes, consulting some books on his desk.</t635> <t636>Then, he took my two letters and placed them with his own by the writing materials; as soon as the door closed behind him, I leaned over to look at the letters, their faces turned to the table.</t636> <t637>I felt no remorse in doing this because, under these circumstances, I felt I had to protect myself in every way I could.</t637>
<t638>One of the letters was addressed to Samuel F.</t638> <t639>Billington, No.</t639> <t640>7, Crescent, Whitby, another to Herr Leuther, Varna; the third to Coutts & Co., London, and the fourth to Herren Klopstock & Billreuth, bankers, Budapest.</t640> <t641>The second and fourth letters were unsealed.</t641> <t642>I was just about to look at them when I saw the door handle move.</t642> <t643>Before the Count, holding another letter, entered the room, I had enough time to put the letters back in their places, return to my book, and settle into my chair.</t643> <t644>The Count took the letters from the table, carefully affixed the stamps, and then turned to me and said:</t644>
<t645>“I believe you will forgive me, but I have a lot of work to do alone tonight.</t645> <t646>I hope you find everything as you wish.”</t646> <t647>He turned at the door and after a moment's hesitation, he added:</t647>
<t648>“Let me give you some advice, my dear young friend - no, let me warn you in all seriousness - if you ever leave these rooms, do not sleep anywhere else in the castle under any circumstances.</t648> <t649>The castle is old, it holds many memories and bad dreams for those who sleep unwisely.</t649> <t650>Be careful!</t650> <t651>If now or in the future sleep overcomes you or seems about to overcome you, immediately return to your own room or one of these rooms so that your sleep will be safe.</t651> <t652>But if you are not careful about this, then,” - He ended his speech in a terrifying manner, as if he was making a gesture of washing his hands.</t652> <t653>I understood very well; my only doubt was whether any dream could be more terrifying than the strange, dreadful darkness and web of mystery that seemed to surround me.</t653>
<t654>Later.</t654> <t655>- I confirm the last words I wrote, but this time there is no doubt.</t655> <t656>I will not be afraid to sleep anywhere he is not.</t656> <t657>I hung the cross at the head of my bed - thus I assume my sleep will be free from dreams; the cross will stay there.</t657>
<t658>When the Count left my side, I went to my room.</t658> <t659>Shortly after, not hearing any sound, I went outside and climbed the stone stairs from which I could look south.</t659> <t660>Compared to the narrow darkness of the courtyard, there was a sense of freedom in the vast area I saw, even though it was unattainable.</t660> <t661>Looking at the view, I truly felt that I was being held in a prison, and despite it being night, I seemed to want to take a breath of fresh air.</t661> <t662>I began to feel that this nocturnal way of life was affecting me badly.</t662> <t663>It's getting on my nerves.</t663> <t664>I'm afraid of my own shadow, and my mind is filled with all sorts of terrifying imaginations.</t664> <t665>God knows, there is ample ground for every kind of horrifying fear in this cursed place!</t665> <t666>I looked at the beautiful expanse bathed in the soft, yellow moonlight until it was almost as bright as day.</t666> <t667>Under the soft light, the distant hills, the shadows of the valleys, and the velvety black passes melted away.</t667> <t668>This simple beauty seemed to have cheered me up; there was peace and comfort in every breath I took.</t668> <t669>When I leaned out of the window, something moving caught my eye, a floor below, slightly to my left, in the place where I assumed the windows of the Count's own room would be, according to the arrangement of the rooms.</t669> <t670>The window I stood at was high, deep, and stone-latticed, and although it was weather-worn, it was still in perfect condition; but it was very clear that the window frame had been here for a long time.</t670> <t671>I pulled back behind the stonework and looked out carefully.</t671>
<t672>What I saw was the Count's head sticking out of the window.</t672> <t673>I couldn't see his face, but I recognized the man by his neck and the movement of his back and arms.</t673> <t674>In any case, it was impossible not to recognize the hands I had so many opportunities to examine.</t674> <t675>This situation first caught my interest and then somehow amused me; it's amazing how even such a small matter can catch and amuse one's interest when one is a captive.</t675> <t676>But when I saw the man slowly emerging from the window, descending down the castle wall into the terrifying void, his cloak spread around him like wide wings, crawling face down, my feelings turned to disgust and horror.</t676> <t677>At first, I couldn't believe my eyes.</t677> <t678>I thought it was some kind of trick played by the moonlight, a strange effect of the shadow; but I kept looking; it couldn't be an optical illusion.</t678> <t679>I saw his fingers and toes grasping the edges of the stones, whose mortar had worn away over the years, and thus, like a lizard moving on the wall, he used every protrusion and roughness to make his way down.</t679>
<t680>What kind of person is this, or what kind of creature in the guise of a human?</t680> <t681>I feel that the horror of this dreadful place has deeply affected me; I am in fear -great fear- and there is no escape for me; I am surrounded by fears that I dare not even think about...</t681>
<t682>15 May.</t682> <t683>- I saw the Count slipping out like a lizard once again.</t683> <t684>He was moving sideways, descending about thirty meters down and quite a bit to the left.</t684> <t685>He disappeared into a hole or a window.</t685> <t686>When his head vanished from sight, I leaned out to see more, but it was no use - the distance was too great to allow a proper viewing angle.</t686> <t687>I knew he had left the castle, and I thought of using this opportunity to explore more than I had dared so far.</t687> <t688>I returned to the room, took the lamp, and tried all the doors.</t688> <t689>As I had guessed, they were all locked, and the locks were relatively new; but I went down the stone stairs to the hall where I had first entered.</t689> <t690>I found that I could easily pull the bolts and remove the huge chains, but the door was locked and there was no key!</t690> <t691>That key must be in the Count's room; I must watch for a time when the door to his room is not locked so I can take the key and escape.</t691> <t692>I continued to carefully examine various stairs and corridors, trying the doors that opened onto them.</t692> <t693>A few small rooms near the hall had open doors, but inside there was nothing to see except old, moth-eaten furniture covered in years of dust.</t693> <t694>But finally, at the top of a staircase, I found a door that, although it appeared to be locked, opened with a bit of force.</t694> <t695>I pushed harder and saw that it was not truly locked, the resistance came from the hinges somehow dropping, and the heavy door was resting on the ground.</t695> <t696>This was an opportunity that might not come again, so after using all my strength and many attempts, I pushed it back enough to get inside.</t696> <t697>Now, I was in the right wing of the castle, one floor below the rooms I knew.</t697> <t698>From the window, I could see that the connected rooms extended along the south wing of the castle, with the room at the end facing both west and south.</t698> <t699>As on the first side, there was a deep chasm on the second side as well.</t699> <t700>The castle was built on the corner of a large rock, making it quite impregnable from three sides, and the large windows were placed where no slingshot, arrow, or rifle could reach, thus providing light and comfort impossible for a place that needed to be defended.</t700> <t701>To the west, there was a wide valley and behind it, in the distance, rows of sharp-peaked mountains rising summit upon summit, with rowan trees and thorny bushes clinging to the cracks, crevices, and fissures in the rock.</t701> <t702>This part of the castle was evidently inhabited in the past because the furniture had a more comfortable air than what I had seen before.</t702> <t703>There were no curtains on the windows, and the yellow moonlight streaming through the diamond-shaped window panes weakened the layer of dust covering everything, somewhat concealing the damage caused by time and moths, making it possible to see colors.</t703> <t704>Under the bright moonlight, my lamp seemed almost useless, but I was glad to have it with me because there was a dreadful loneliness in this place that chilled my blood and unnerved me.</t704> <t705>Still, it was better than being alone in the rooms I had come to hate due to the Count's presence, and after trying to steady my nerves a bit, I felt a soft peace settle over me.</t705> <t706>Here I am, sitting at a small oak table where, in old times, a lovely lady might have penned a love letter full of spelling mistakes, blushing as she thought long and hard, writing in shorthand in my journal about what has happened since I last closed it.</t706> <t707>This is the nineteenth century, as updated as it can be.</t707> <t708>Yet, if my senses do not deceive me, the old times had their own unique powers that "modernity" could not kill, and still do.</t708>
<t709>Later: the morning of May 16.</t709> <t710>- My God, keep my mind safe, because in the end, I have fallen to this state.</t710> <t711>Security and the assurance of security are things of the past.</t711> <t712>During my time here, there is only one thing to wish for: Not to go mad, that is, if I am not already mad.</t712> <t713>If I am in my right mind, it is truly maddening to think that among the horrible things lurking in this hateful place, the least terrifying for me is the Count, and that as long as I work for his purpose, the only person I can go to for safety is the Count.</t713> <t714>Oh, Almighty God! Merciful God! Help me stay calm, because straying from this path truly means going mad.</t714> <t715>I am beginning to gain clarity on certain matters that previously confused me.</t715> <t716>Until now, I had never fully understood what Shakespeare meant when he had Hamlet say these words:</t716>
<t717>My tablets! Quickly! My tablets!</t717>
<t718>I must write these down...</t718> <t719>11</t719>
<t720>Now I feel as if my mind has lost its balance or as if the shock that should end its ruin has come, and I turn to my journal for peace.</t720> <t721>The habit of writing everything down completely will comfort me.</t721>
<t722>Kont's mysterious warning had frightened me at the time; now, thinking about it, it scares me even more because he will have great authority over me in the future.</t722> <t723>I will be afraid to doubt what he might say in the future!</t723>
<t724>After writing in my journal and fortunately putting the notebook and pen in my pocket, I felt sleepy.</t724> <t725>I remembered the Count's warning, but I enjoyed defying him.</t725> <t726>The feeling of sleep had settled over me, and stubbornness had come along as sleep's servant.</t726> <t727>The soft moonlight was soothing me, and the vastness outside was giving me a sense of freedom that delighted me.</t727> <t728>Tonight, I decided not to return to those gloomy rooms and to sleep in this room where, in old times, ladies with sensitive hearts would sit and sing in sorrow because their men were far away in merciless wars, and they lived sweet lives.</t728> <t729>I pulled a large sofa close to the corner so that I could watch the beautiful view of the east and south while lying down and prepare myself for sleep without worrying about the dust.</t729>
<t730>I must have fallen asleep; I hope so, but I fear what happened afterward was terrifyingly real - so real that now, as I sit here in the bright daylight of the morning, I can't believe even a little that it was all a dream.</t730>
<t731>I was not alone.</t731> <t732>The room was the same, it hadn't changed at all since I entered; in the bright moonlight, I could see the long dust trails disturbed by my own footprints all across the floor.</t732> <t733>In the moonlight, directly in front of me were three young women; judging by their clothes and demeanor, they were noble ladies.</t733> <t734>At that moment, when I saw them, I thought I was dreaming, because despite the moonlight being behind them, their shadows did not fall on the ground.</t734> <t735>They approached me and looked at me for a while, then whispered together.</t735> <t736>Two of them were brunettes and had high noses resembling an eagle's beak like the Count's, and large, dark, piercing eyes that seemed almost red compared to the pale, yellow moon.</t736> <t737>The other was as blonde as could be, with wavy golden hair and pale, sapphire-like eyes.</t737> <t738>It was as if I knew her face from somewhere, in connection with an imaginary fear, but at that moment, I couldn't figure out how and where I knew her from.</t738> <t739>All three had dazzling white teeth that shone like pearls against the redness of their voluptuous lips.</t739> <t740>There was something about them that made me uneasy, a bit of longing and at the same time, a deadly fear.</t740> <t741>In my heart, I felt a wicked, burning desire for them to kiss me with those red lips.</t741> <t742>It's not good for me to write these here, as one day Mina might see them and it could cause her pain, but this is the truth.</t742> <t743>They whispered and then all three laughed - such silvery and harmonious, yet harsh laughs that seemed like they could never come from the softness of human lips.</t743> <t744>It was like the unbearable, chilling delight that comes from a glass of water when played by a skillful hand.</t744> <t745>The blonde girl coquettishly nodded her head and the other two encouraged her.</t745> <t746>One of them said:</t746>
<t747>"Come on! You are first and we will follow you; the right to start is yours."</t747><t748>"</t748>
<t749>The other added:</t749>
<t750>“A young and strong man; there are kisses for all of us.”</t750> <t751>I lay silently, looking from under my eyelashes with the pain of a sweet anticipation.</t751> <t752>The blonde girl walked over and continued to lean over me until I could feel the movement of her breath.</t752> <t753>In one sense, it was sweet - sweet as honey, I felt the shiver caused by her voice in my nerves, but like the smell of blood, there was a painful, painful ugliness lying beneath the sweetness.</t753>
<t754>I was afraid to lift my eyelids, but I looked from under my eyelashes and saw perfectly.</t754> <t755>The blonde girl knelt down and leaned over me with considerable pleasure.</t755> <t756>There was a conscious lust in her actions that was both exciting and disgusting, and she licked her lips like an animal as she bent her neck backward; until I saw the wetness shining on her red tongue moving over her crimson lips and sharp white teeth in the moonlight.</t756> <t757>Her head descended lower and lower, as if her lips were about to slip under my mouth and chin and sink into my throat.</t757> <t758>Then she stopped, and I could hear the slurping sound her tongue made as she licked her teeth and lips, feeling her hot breath on my neck.</t758> <t759>Then, the skin of my throat began to shiver as it does when a hand approaches to tickle it.</t759> <t760>On the overly sensitive skin of my throat, I could feel the soft, chilling touch of her lips and the touch and wait of her sharp teeth.</t760> <t761>In a state of dizzying ecstasy, I closed my eyes and waited - waited with a pounding heart.</t761>
<t762>But at that very moment, another feeling spread through me with the speed of lightning.</t762> <t763>I felt the presence of the Count and that he was caught in a storm of rage.</t763> <t764>When my eyes involuntarily opened, I saw the Count's strong hand grasping the slender neck of the blonde woman and pulling her back with the strength of a giant, his blue eyes changing with anger, his white teeth clashing with fury, and his pale cheeks burning with passion.</t764> <t765>But the Count! I had never imagined that even the demons in the pits of Hell could have such wrath and anger.</t765> <t766>His eyes were absolutely blazing.</t766> <t767>The red light in his eyes was terrifying; it was as if the fires of Hell were burning behind his eyes.</t767> <t768>His face was as pale as a corpse and the lines on his face were as taut as tight strings; his thick eyebrows, meeting above his nose, now looked like a rod swollen with molten metal.</t768> <t769>With a single harsh movement of his arm, he flung the woman away from him and then made a gesture as if to repel them; it was the same commanding hand gesture he used against the wolves.</t769> <t770>In a voice that was low and almost like a whisper, yet piercing the air and echoing in the room, he said:</t770>
<t771>“With what audacity do any of you dare touch him?</t771> <t772>How dare you look at him when I have forbidden it?</t772> <t773>Step back, I tell you!</t773> <t774>This man belongs to me!</t774> <t775>Do not mess with him or you will have to deal with me.</t775><t776>”</t776>
<t777>The blonde girl, laughing with a suggestive coquetry, replied to the Count:</t777>
<t778>“You never loved yourself; you never love at all!”</t778> <t779>The other women joined in, and such joyless, harsh, soulless laughter echoed in the room that hearing it almost made me faint; it was like the joy of demons.</t779> <t780>After carefully looking at my face, the Count turned and said in a soft whisper:</t780>
<t781>“Yes, I can love too; you yourself can say this by looking at the past.</t781> <t782>Isn't that so?</t782> <t783>Yes, now I promise you, when I'm done with him, you will kiss him as you wish.</t783> <t784>Now go!</t784> <t785>Go! I must wake him up because there are things to be done.</t785><t786>”</t786>
<t787>One of them pointed to the bag that the Count had thrown to the ground, which moved as if something alive was inside, and said with a low laugh, "Aren't we going to drink anything tonight?"</t787> <t788>The Count nodded in response, as if to say yes.</t788> <t789>One of the women sprang forward and opened the bag.</t789> <t790>If my ears did not deceive me, I heard sounds of labored breathing and moaning, as if from a half-drowned child.</t790> <t791>While I was frozen with fear, the women gathered around the bag; but when I looked, they had vanished, and the dreadful bag had disappeared with them.</t791> <t792>There was no door nearby, and they could not have passed by me without my noticing.</t792> <t793>They seemed to have flown out through the window among the moonbeams, for outside, I could see faint shapes for a moment before they completely vanished.</t793>
<t794>Then terror overcame me and I lost consciousness.</t794>
<t795>IV</t795>
<t796>Jonathan Harker's journal (continued)</t796>
<t797>I woke up in my own bed.</t797> <t798>If I didn't dream, the Count must have carried me here.</t798> <t799>I tried to find a convincing explanation, but I couldn't reach a definite conclusion.</t799> <t800>Undoubtedly, there were some small pieces of evidence, like my clothes being folded and placed in a manner that is not my habit.</t800> <t801>My watch was not wound, and the last thing I would do before going to bed would certainly be to wind it; many other details like this.</t801> <t802>But these cannot be evidence, as they could be proof that my mind is not as usual and for one reason or another, there is no doubt that I was all mixed up.</t802> <t803>I must be careful to find evidence.</t803> <t804>I am pleased about one thing: If the Count carried me here and undressed me, he must have done it in a hurry because my pockets were untouched.</t804> <t805>I am sure this journal would be an irresistible mystery for him.</t805> <t806>He would have taken and destroyed it.</t806> <t807>Although it is filled with fear for me, as I look at my room now, it seems like a kind of refuge because nothing can be more terrifying than those dreadful women waiting to suck my blood -continuing to wait.</t807>
<t808>May 18.</t808> <t809>- I went down to look at that room again in daylight, because I must learn the truth.</t809> <t810>When I reached the door at the top of the stairs, I saw that it was closed.</t810> <t811>The frame had been pushed with such great force that the wooden joinery in that part was shattered.</t811> <t812>I could see the latch tongue inside, but the door was bolted from the inside.</t812> <t813>I'm afraid what I experienced was not a dream, and I had to act according to this belief.</t813>
<t814>May 19.</t814> <t815>- It is certain that I have fallen into a trap like an animal.</t815> <t816>Last night, the Count, with a pleasant but deceptive demeanor, asked me to write three letters: one stating that my work here is almost finished and that I will be heading home in a few days, another saying that I will leave the day after writing the letter, and the third indicating that I have left the castle and arrived in Bistriţa.</t816> <t817>I wanted to oppose this, but given that I am entirely under his control at the moment, I felt that openly arguing with the Count would be madness, and refusing his request would arouse suspicion and anger him.</t817> <t818>He knows that I know too much and that I must die so that I won't be a danger to him; my only chance is to bide my time.</t818> <t819>Something might come up that will give me a chance to escape.</t819> <t820>A kind of rage, similar to the fury that appeared in his eyes when he threw that blonde woman away from himself, is gathering in his eyes.</t820> <t821>He said that the postal service is sparse and unreliable, and that writing now would put my friends at ease, and he so insistently assured me that if I had the chance to extend my stay here, he would cancel the forward-dated letters to be held in Bistriţa until the time came, that opposing him would have aroused new suspicions.</t821> <t822>So I pretended to agree with him and asked what dates I should put on the letters.</t822> <t823>He calculated for a minute and then said:</t823>
<t824>"The first should be June 12, the second June 19, and the third June 29."</t824><t825></t825>
<t826>Now I know the rest of my life.</t826> <t827>My God, help me!</t827>
<t828>May 28.</t828> <t829>- There is a chance for an escape or at least to send news home.</t829> <t830>A group of Gypsies came to the castle and set up camp in the courtyard.</t830> <t831>I have notes about these Gypsies in my notebook.</t831> <t832>Although they are related to the ordinary Gypsies around the world, they are unique to this part of the world.</t832> <t833>In Hungary and Transylvania, there are thousands of them, almost all of whom are lawless.</t833> <t834>As a rule, they attach themselves to a great noble or boyar and take his name.</t834> <t835>They are fearless, godless except for superstitions, and speak a unique type of the Romanian language.</t835>
<t836>I will try to write a few letters and have these Gypsies mail them.</t836> <t837>I even spoke to them from my window to establish some sort of acquaintance.</t837> <t838>They took off their hats, bowed before me, and made many signs that I couldn't understand, just as I couldn't understand their spoken language...</t838>
<t839>I wrote the letters.</t839> <t840>I wrote Mina’s in shorthand and asked Mr. Hawkins to speak only with Mina.</t840> <t841>I explained my situation to Mina without mentioning the horrors I could only speculate about.</t841> <t842>If I open my heart to her, it would shake her greatly and she would die of fear.</t842> <t843>If the letters do not go, the Count will still learn my secret and the extent of what I know.</t843>
<t844>I gave the letters; I threw them along with a gold coin through the bars of my window and made all the signs I could to ensure they would be mailed.</t844> <t845>The man who received the letters pressed them to his chest, bowed, and placed them under his hat.</t845> <t846>There was nothing more I could do.</t846> <t847>I returned to the study and began to read a book.</t847> <t848>Since the Count did not come, I started to write here...</t848>
<t849>The count arrived.</t849> <t850>He sat next to me and, while opening the two letters, said in the softest voice: “The Gypsies, although I do not know where they came from, gave me these letters which I will of course take an interest in.</t850> <t851>Look!” - He must have looked inside.</t851> <t852>“One is from you to my friend Peter Hawkins; the other,” - here, as soon as he opened the letter and saw the strange symbols, a dark expression settled on his face and his eyes flared sinfully - “the other is something vile, a great insult to friendship and hospitality! Unsigned.</t852> <t853>Yes! So it cannot concern us.”</t853> <t854>He calmly held the letter and the envelope to the flame of the lamp until they burned.</t854> <t855>Then he continued his words:</t855>
<t856>“The letter to Hawkins, since it is yours, I will of course send it.</t856> <t857>Your letters are sacred to me.</t857> <t858>Forgive me, my friend, for breaking the seal unknowingly.</t858> <t859>Aren’t you going to seal it again?” He handed me the letter and, bowing politely, gave me a clean envelope.</t859> <t860>All I could do was rewrite the address and quietly hand the envelope to the Count.</t860> <t861>When he left the room, I heard the key turn slowly.</t861> <t862>A minute later, I looked at the door and tried it; it was locked.</t862>
<t863>The Count woke me up by quietly entering the room one or two hours later, because I had fallen asleep on the couch.</t863> <t864>He was in a very kind and cheerful manner, and upon seeing that I was asleep, he said:</t864>
<t865>"So, you are exhausted, my friend.</t865> <t866>Go to bed.</t866> <t867>The best rest is there.</t867> <t868>Since I have a lot of work to do, I might miss the pleasure of talking with you tonight; but please, you sleep."</t868> <t869>I went to my room and lay down, and strangely enough, I slept without dreaming at all.</t869> <t870>Despair has its own ways of soothing.</t870>
<t871>May 31.</t871> <t872>- This morning, when I woke up, I thought of taking some paper and envelopes from my bag and keeping them in my pocket so that I could write if I got the chance; but again, a surprise, again a shock!</t872>
<t873>All the pieces of paper and along with them all my notes, my notes on railways and travel, my letter of credit, in fact, everything that could be useful to me if I left the castle, was gone.</t873> <t874>I sat and thought for a while, and then an idea came to my mind; I searched my wardrobe and the coat rack where I had put my clothes.</t874>
<t875>The suit and coat I wore on my journey, along with my blanket, were gone; I couldn't find any trace of them anywhere.</t875> <t876>This seemed like a new kind of devilry plan...</t876>
<t877>June 17.</t877> <t878>- This morning, while I was sitting on the edge of my bed, straining my mind, I heard the cracking of whips and the pounding of horses' hooves on the stony road beyond the courtyard.</t878> <t879>In high spirits, I ran to the window and saw two large wagons, each pulled by eight sturdy horses, entering the courtyard, with a Slovak at the head of each pair of horses, wearing a wide hat, a studded belt, dirty sheepskin, and high boots.</t879> <t880>They also had long sticks in their hands.</t880> <t881>I ran to the door to join them in the main hall, which I thought might have been opened for them.</t881> <t882>Another shock: My door was locked from the outside.</t882>
<t883>Then I ran to the window and called out to them.</t883> <t884>They looked up at me stupidly and pointed, but just then the hetman of the Gypsies came out and said something to them that made them laugh when he saw them pointing at my window.</t884> <t885>From then on, no effort, no pitiful cry or painful plea would even make them look at me.</t885> <t886>They turned and left resolutely.</t886> <t887>There were large square crates with thick rope handles on the wagons; judging by how easily the Slovaks carried them and the sounds they made when moved roughly, the crates were obviously empty.</t887> <t888>When all were unloaded from the wagons and piled in a corner of the courtyard, the Gypsy gave the Slovaks some money, and spitting on it for good luck, they lazily went to their horses.</t888> <t889>Soon after, I heard the crack of their whips fade into the distance.</t889>
<t890>June 24, before sunrise.</t890> <t891>- The Count left my side early last night and locked himself in his room.</t891> <t892>As soon as I gathered my courage, I ran to the spiral staircase and looked out the window facing south.</t892> <t893>I thought of following the Count, because something was going on.</t893> <t894>The Gypsies were settled somewhere in the castle and were doing some kind of work.</t894> <t895>I know this because I occasionally hear the muffled sounds of digging and shoveling from afar, and whatever this is, it must be nearing the end of some cruel evil.</t895>
<t896>When I saw something coming out of the Count's window, I had been at the window for less than half an hour.</t896> <t897>I pulled back and watched carefully and saw the man's entire body come out.</t897> <t898>It was a new shock for me to see that the Count was wearing the clothes I wore while traveling here and had slung that dreadful bag, which the women had taken away, over his shoulder.</t898> <t899>There was no doubt about what he was looking for and that he was doing it in my clothes!</t899> <t900>So this was the new evil plan: He would make others think they saw me, and thus he could leave traces in the villages and towns of me being seen while posting my own letters, and any mischief he could do would be blamed on me by the local people.</t900>
<t901>It angers me to think that this could continue while I am confined here like a real prisoner and deprived of the protection of the law, which is a right and solace even for criminals.</t901>
<t902>I thought, let me wait for Kont's return, and I stubbornly sat by the window for a long time.</t902> <t903>Then, I started to see small strange dots floating in the moonlight.</t903> <t904>They were like tiny dust particles, and I noticed that they were swirling and coming together like a cloud.</t904> <t905>I watched them in peace, and a kind of tranquility settled over me.</t905> <t906>To better enjoy this aerial display, I took a more comfortable position in the window frame and leaned back.</t906>
<t907>Something; distant from my sight, the low, heart-wrenching dog barks coming from down the valley caused me to startle.</t907><t908>The barks were ringing louder in my ears, and as the dust particles floating in the air seemed to take on new shapes while dancing in the moonlight, I felt like I was trying to wake up, obeying the call of my instincts; no!</t908><t909>My soul was striving for this, and my half-remembered sensitivities wanted to respond to the call.</t909><t910>I was being hypnotized!</t910><t911>The dust was dancing faster and faster, and as the moonbeams passed by me and moved toward the mass of gloom beyond, they seemed to be vibrating.</t911><t912>They gathered even more until they appeared to turn into vague silhouettes.</t912><t913>And then, I jolted, fully awakened, and ran away from there, screaming with all my senses in control.</t913><t914>The silhouettes, increasingly materializing from the moon's rays, belonged to my ill fate, those three ghost-like women.</t914><t915>I fled and somehow felt safer in my room, where the moonlight did not enter, and the lamp was shining brightly.</t915>
<t916>After a few hours had passed, I heard something stir in the Count's room, something like a sharp cry that was quickly stifled; then silence - a deep and terrible silence that made my hair stand on end.</t916> <t917>My heart pounding, I tried the door; but I was locked in my cell and there was nothing I could do.</t917> <t918>I sat down and cried.</t918>
<t919>While sitting in the courtyard outside, I heard a sound - it was a woman's cry of pain.</t919> <t920>I ran to the window, opened it, and looked through the bars.</t920> <t921>Indeed, there was a woman with disheveled hair, looking exhausted from running, holding her hands over her heart.</t921> <t922>When she saw my face at the window, she lunged forward and shouted in a threatening voice:</t922>
<t923>“Monster! Give me my child!”</t923><t924>”</t924>
<t925>He threw himself on his knees and raised his hands, shouting the same words in tones that wrenched my heart.</t925> <t926>Then he tore at his hair and beat his chest, surrendering himself to the intensity of exaggerated emotions.</t926> <t927>Finally, he lunged forward; although I couldn't see him, I could hear him pounding on the door with his bare hands.</t927>
<t928>Somewhere up high, probably in the tower, I heard the Count calling out with his harsh, metallic whisper.</t928> <t929>It seemed as though the howling of wolves from afar was answering his call.</t929> <t930>Before long, a pack of wolves, like a dam releasing its waters, poured into the courtyard through the wide gate.</t930>
<t931>No scream rose from the woman and the howling of the wolves was short-lived.</t931> <t932>Before long, they returned one by one, licking their lips.</t932>
<t933>Since I now knew what had happened to her child, I couldn't pity the woman; it was better for her to die.</t933>
<t934>What will I do?</t934> <t935>What can I do?</t935> <t936>How can I escape and get rid of this terrifying captivity of night, gloom, and fear?</t936>
<t937>June 25, morning.</t937> <t938>- No one knows how sweet and precious the morning can seem to the heart and eyes without bearing the pain of the night.</t938> <t939>This morning, when the sun rose high enough to strike the top of the large door opposite my window, it seemed to me as if the pigeon on the arch was illuminated at the high point it touched.</t939> <t940>My fear flowed off me as if it were a garment made of steam, melting away in the heat.</t940> <t941>I must somehow take action while I have the courage of the day.</t941> <t942>Last night, one of my future-dated letters was mailed; the first in a deadly series that will erase all traces of my existence from the earth.</t942>
<t943>I shouldn't think about this.</t943> <t944>It's time for action!</t944>
<t945>The times I was harassed or threatened or somehow fell into danger or fear were always at night.</t945> <t946>I have not yet seen the Count in daylight.</t946> <t947>Could he be sleeping while others are awake and awake while they are sleeping?</t947>
<t948>Ah, if only I could enter the room!</t948> <t949>But this is not possible.</t949> <t950>The door is always locked, there is no way I can go.</t950>
<t951>Yes, if one dares, there is a way.</t951> <t952>Why shouldn't another body go the way his body went?</t952> <t953>I saw with my own eyes that he crawled out of his window; why shouldn't I emulate him and crawl in through the window?</t953> <t954>The chances are slim, but my situation is more hopeless than my chances.</t954> <t955>I will take the risk.</t955> <t956>The worst that could happen is death.</t956> <t957>Human death is not like the death of a calf, and the terror of the "Other World" may still be open to me.</t957> <t958>God, help me in my duty!</t958> <t959>If I fail, goodbye Mina; goodbye my loyal friend and second father; farewell to you all and lastly, Mina!</t959>
<t960>The same day, later.</t960> <t961>- I did my best and, with God's help, I returned safely to this room.</t961> <t962>I must write down all the details in order.</t962> <t963>While my courage was still fresh, I went straight to the window on the south side of the castle and immediately stepped out onto the narrow stone ledge that surrounds this side of the building.</t963> <t964>The stones were large and roughly cut, and the mortar between them had worn away over time.</t964> <t965>I took off my boots and embarked on this desperate path.</t965> <t966>So that I wouldn't suddenly see the terrifying depth and succumb to it, I looked down once, but then kept my eyes away from it.</t966> <t967>I knew the direction and the distance to the Count's window quite well, and I aimed there as best as I could to seize the opportunity.</t967> <t968>I didn't get dizzy - I think I was too excited - the time it took until I found myself standing at the window ledge trying to open the sash seemed ridiculously short.</t968> <t969>But I tensed up when I leaned in and my feet first slipped inside the window.</t969> <t970>Then I looked around for the Count but discovered something with surprise and delight.</t970> <t971>The room was empty!</t971> <t972>It was furnished with a few odd items that looked as if they had never been used; the furniture in the room was in the same style as the rooms in the south wing and was covered in dust.</t972> <t973>I searched for the key but it wasn't in the lock and I couldn't find it anywhere.</t973> <t974>The only thing I found instead was a large pile of gold in one of the corners - all sorts of gold coins, covered with a layer of dust as if they had been lying there for a long time, from Rome, England, Austria, Hungary, Greece, and Turkey.</t974> <t975>Among those that caught my attention, none were less than three hundred years old.</t975> <t976>There were also chains and ornaments adorned with precious stones, but they were all old and tarnished.</t976>
<t977>There was a heavy door in one corner of the room.</t977> <t978>I tried this door because I needed to investigate further, having not found the key to the room or the key to the outer door, which were the main subjects of my research, or all my efforts would be in vain.</t978> <t979>The door was open and led to a stone corridor that descended steeply to a spiral staircase.</t979> <t980>Since the steps were dark, illuminated only by the loopholes in the heavy stone walls, I descended carefully, watching my step.</t980> <t981>At the bottom, there was a dark, tunnel-like corridor from which emanated a deadly, nauseating smell, like the scent of old, overturned earth.</t981> <t982>As I progressed down the corridor, the smell grew closer and heavier.</t982> <t983>Finally, I opened the heavy door that was ajar and found myself in an old, abandoned chapel that was evidently used as a cemetery.</t983> <t984>The roof had collapsed, and there were steps leading down to underground tombs in two places, but the ground had been recently dug up, and the soil had clearly been filled into large wooden crates brought by the Slovaks.</t984> <t985>There was no one around, so I searched for another exit but found none.</t985> <t986>Then, to leave no stone unturned, I scanned every square inch of the floor.</t986> <t987>Despite my terror, I even descended into the dimly lit burial chambers where the light flickered.</t987> <t988>I entered two of them but saw nothing except old coffin fragments and piles of dust; however, in the third one, I discovered something.</t988>
<t989>Count was lying on top of a freshly dug mound of earth inside one of the large chests, which were about fifty in total!</t989> <t990>He was either dead or sleeping, I couldn't tell which, because his eyes were open and rigid - but there was no glassy look that comes with death - despite his pallor, there was a warmth of life in his cheeks and his lips were as red as ever.</t990> <t991>However, there was no sign of movement, pulse, breath, or heartbeat.</t991> <t992>I leaned over him and tried to find a sign of life, but it was in vain.</t992> <t993>He couldn't have been lying here for long because the smell of the earth would have dissipated within a few hours.</t993> <t994>Next to the chest, the lid, which had holes drilled here and there, was lying.</t994> <t995>I thought the keys might be on him, but when I started to search, I saw such a look of hatred in his dead eyes - even though they were dead, they were not aware of me or my presence - that I fled from there and left the Count's room through the window, crawling along the castle walls again.</t995> <t996>I returned to my room, threw myself onto the bed, breathless, and tried to think...</t996>
<t997>June 29.</t997> <t998>- Today is the day of my last letter, and the Count has taken the necessary steps to prove it is real because I saw him leaving the castle again through the same window and in my clothes.</t998> <t999>I wished I had a gun or a deadly weapon to destroy him as he descended the wall like a lizard; but I fear that no weapon made by human hands can have any effect on him.</t999> <t1000>I did not dare to wait for the Count's return because I was afraid of seeing those strange sisters.</t1000> <t1001>I returned to the library and read books there until I fell asleep.</t1001>
<t1002>I was awakened by the Count, who was looking at me with the wildest expression a person could have; he said:</t1002>
<t1003>“Tomorrow, my friend, we must part.</t1003> <t1004>You return to your beautiful England, and I will return to some of my affairs which may result in us never meeting again.</t1004> <t1005>The letter you wrote home has been sent; I will not be here tomorrow, but everything will be ready for your journey.</t1005> <t1006>In the morning, Gypsies and Slovaks who have some business here will arrive.</t1006> <t1007>When they leave, my carriage will come to pick you up and take you to the Borgo Pass to meet the coach going from Bistriţa to Bukovina.</t1007> <t1008>But I hope to see you more at Dracula’s Castle.”</t1008> <t1009>I was suspicious of him and decided to test his sincerity.</t1009> <t1010>Sincerity!</t1010> <t1011>It would be disrespectful to write this word in association with such a monster; so I asked him directly: “Why can’t I leave this evening?</t1011><t1012>”</t1012>
<t1013>“Because, dear sir, my coachman and my horses are not here as they have work to do.</t1013><t1014>”</t1014>
<t1015>"But I will walk gladly.</t1015> <t1016>I want to get away as soon as possible.</t1016><t1017>"</t1017>
<t1018>He smiled; it was such a soft, calm, and devilish smile that I knew there was a kind of trick beneath its softness.</t1018> <t1019>He said:</t1019>
<t1020>“What about your suitcases?</t1020><t1021>”</t1021>
<t1022>"I don't care.</t1022> <t1023>I can have them picked up later.</t1023><t1024>"</t1024>
<t1025>The count stood up and, with a sweetness that caused me to rub my eyes and seemed quite real, said:</t1025>
<t1026>“You English have a saying that greatly appeals to me because it governs our boyars: ‘Welcome the arrival of the guest, hasten their departure.’</t1026> <t1027>Come with me, my dear young friend.</t1027> <t1028>Although I am saddened by your departure and your sudden desire for it, do not stay in my home for even an hour against your will.</t1028> <t1029>Come!” With a lamp in hand, he descended the stairs with majestic dignity and proceeded ahead of me down the corridor.</t1029> <t1030>Suddenly, he stopped.</t1030> <t1031>“Listen!</t1031><t1032>”</t1032>
<t1033>The howling of many wolves was heard up close.</t1033> <t1034>The sound had almost begun with the raising of the Count's hand, just like the music of a large orchestra under the direction of a conductor.</t1034> <t1035>After a momentary hesitation, he advanced to the door with his majestic demeanor, pulled the heavy bolts, removed the heavy chains from their hooks, and began to open the door.</t1035>
<t1036>I saw with great astonishment that the door was not locked.</t1036> <t1037>I looked around with suspicion, but I couldn't see anything resembling a key.</t1037>
<t1038>As the door began to open, the howling of the wolves outside grew louder and filled with rage; with their red jaws and blunt-clawed feet, they entered through the opening door.</t1038> <t1039>At that moment, I realized that it was useless to oppose the Count.</t1039> <t1040>With such allies at his command, I could do nothing.</t1040> <t1041>Yet still, the door continued to open slowly, and in the gap stood only the body of the Count.</t1041> <t1042>Suddenly, it dawned on me that this could be the moment and method of my demise; I would be given to the wolves, and it would be as a result of my own suggestion.</t1042> <t1043>There was a diabolical evil in this, worthy of the Count, and I cried out for one last chance:</t1043>
<t1044>“Close the door; I will wait until morning!” And then, to hide the tears caused by bitter disappointment, I covered my face with my hands.</t1044> <t1045>The Count closed the door with a single movement of his strong arm, the large bolts clanged and settled into place, the sound echoing down the corridor.</t1045>
<t1046>We returned to the library in silence; a minute or two later, I went to my own room.</t1046> <t1047>The last time I saw Count Dracula, he was looking at me with a red glint of triumph in his eyes and a smile that could have made Judas in Hell proud, kissing his own hand.</t1047>
<t1048>As I was about to lie down in my room, I thought I heard a whisper at my door.</t1048> <t1049>I quietly went to the door and listened.</t1049> <t1050>If my ears did not deceive me, I heard the Count's voice: "Go back, go back, return to your place!</t1050> <t1051>Your time has not yet come.</t1051> <t1052>Wait.</t1052> <t1053>Be patient.</t1053> <t1054>Tomorrow night, tomorrow night is yours!" There was a low, sweet wave of laughter, and I angrily opened the door and saw three terrifying women licking their lips outside.</t1054> <t1055>When I appeared, they let out a horrifying laugh and fled.</t1055>
<t1056>I turned around and threw myself onto my knees.</t1056> <t1057>So, this is how close my end is, huh?</t1057> <t1058>Tomorrow! Tomorrow! God, help me and those who love me.</t1058>
<t1059>June 30, morning.</t1059> <t1060>- These might be the last words I write in this journal.</t1060> <t1061>I slept until just before dawn and when I woke up, I threw myself onto my knees because I had decided that if Death were to come, it should find me ready.</t1061>
<t1062>Finally, I felt the slight change in the air and realized that morning had come.</t1062> <t1063>Then, the crowing of the rooster welcoming the morning came, and I felt safe.</t1063> <t1064>With a content heart, I opened my door and ran downstairs to the hall.</t1064> <t1065>I had seen that the door was not locked, and now escape was before me.</t1065> <t1066>With hands trembling with eagerness, I unhooked the chains and pulled the mighty bolts.</t1066>
<t1067>But the door did not budge.</t1067> <t1068>I fell into despair.</t1068> <t1069>I pulled, pulled, and though it was mighty, I shook it until it creaked in its frame.</t1069> <t1070>I could see that the latch was inside.</t1070> <t1071>The door had been locked after I left the Count's side.</t1071>
<t1072>Then, taking every risk, a wild desire to get hold of that key seized me; right there and then, I decided to climb the wall once more and reach the Count's room.</t1072> <t1073>He could kill me, but death was the best option among the evils.</t1073> <t1074>Without wasting any time, I ran to the east window and, as I had done before, crawled along the wall and descended into the Count's room.</t1074> <t1075>It was empty, but I was expecting that.</t1075> <t1076>I couldn't see the key anywhere, but the pile of gold was there.</t1076> <t1077>I passed through the door in the corner, went down the spiral staircase, and walked through the dark corridor leading to the old chapel.</t1077>
<t1078>Now I knew well enough where to find the monster I was looking for.</t1078>
<t1079>The large chest was in the same place, close to the wall, but its lid, though not reinforced, was placed on top; the nails were also ready in their places to be hammered into their slots.</t1079><t1080>I knew I had to search its surface to find the key, so I lifted the lid and leaned it against the wall; then I saw something that filled my soul with fear.</t1080><t1081>The Count was lying there, but he looked as if he had half-rejuvenated, for his white hair and mustache had turned to a dark iron gray; his cheeks were fuller, and beneath his pale skin, a ruby red was visible; his mouth was redder than ever, as there were fresh blood droplets on his lips, trickling from the corners of his mouth and running down his chin and neck.</t1081><t1082>Even his sunken, gleaming eyes seemed lost among the swollen flesh, for his eyelids and under-eye bags were swollen.</t1082><t1083>The horrific creature seemed to be bloated with blood; he lay there like a repulsive parasite, exhausted from overindulgence.</t1083><t1084>When I leaned over to touch him, my skin crawled, and all my senses revolted at the contact; but I had to search, or I was doomed.</t1084><t1085>The approaching night could similarly present my body as a feast to that terrifying trio.</t1085><t1086>I searched his entire body, but I found not a single trace of the key.</t1086><t1087>Then I stopped and looked at the Count.</t1087><t1088>There was a mocking smile on his swollen face, which seemed to be driving me mad.</t1088><t1089>Perhaps this was the creature I had helped move to London to satisfy his thirst for blood among the city's fertile millions for centuries to come, creating a new and ever-expanding circle of half-demons clogged with the desperate.</t1089><t1090>This thought drove me insane.</t1090><t1091>I was seized with a terrible desire to rid the world of such a monster.</t1091><t1092>There was no deadly weapon nearby, but I raised the shovel the workers had used to fill the chests, with its point downward, to strike the hateful face.</t1092><t1093>But just as I did so, his eyes turned to me, burning with a terror reminiscent of mythological serpents.</t1093><t1094>This sight seemed to paralyze me, and the shovel twisted in my hand, missing his face and opening a deep wound above the forehead.</t1094><t1095>The shovel slipped from my hand and fell onto the chest, its edge catching the corner of the lid; the lid closed again, hiding the horrific thing from my eyes.</t1095><t1096>The last thing I saw was a swollen face, smeared with blood, fixed in a grin full of evil that held its place in the deepest hell.</t1096>
<t1097>I kept thinking about what my next move should be, but my mind was like a burning field, and I waited with a growing sense of hopelessness inside me.</t1097> <t1098>While waiting, I heard a Gypsy song sung by cheerful voices coming closer and closer, and amidst the songs, the turning of heavy wheels and the cracking of whips; the Gypsies and Slovaks the Count had mentioned were coming.</t1098> <t1099>After taking one last look around and at the coffin hiding the disgusting body, I decided to dash out as soon as the door opened and escaped to the Count's room.</t1099> <t1100>I listened to the sounds with great care and heard the key turning and the heavy door being pulled back downstairs.</t1100> <t1101>There must have been other entrances, or one of the locked doors had a key.</t1101> <t1102>Then, footsteps making noise and echoing in the corridor were heard, moving away.</t1102> <t1103>I turned to run to the crypt where I could find the new entrance; but at that moment, a violent and sudden wind blew, slamming the door opening to the spiral staircase and scattering the dust on the upper lintel.</t1103> <t1104>When I ran to open the door, I found it desperately jammed.</t1104> <t1105>I was a prisoner again, and fate was weaving its webs around me more tightly.</t1105>
<t1106>As I write these, there are numerous footsteps and the noise of weights being placed heavily on the floor in the corridor below; those being placed are undoubtedly crates filled with soil.</t1106> <t1107>The sound of hammering is heard; this is the crate being nailed shut.</t1107> <t1108>Now, I can hear the sound of heavy footsteps, followed by many other footsteps, echoing along the corridor.</t1108>
<t1109>The door closed, chains rattled; the key is turning in the lock; I can hear the key being removed; then another door opens and closes; I hear the creak of the lock and the latch.</t1109>
<t1110>Listen! In the courtyard and on the stony road, listen to the turning of heavy wheels, the cracking of whips, and the Gypsy chorus singing as they move away.</t1110> <t1111>I am alone in the castle with those dreadful women.</t1111> <t1112>Ah!

<t1126>Forgive me for being so late in writing, but I was overwhelmed with work.</t1126><t1127>The life of an assistant teacher can sometimes be challenging.</t1127><t1128>I am longing to be with you, to talk freely by the seaside and dream together.</t1128><t1129>I've been working a lot lately because I want to keep up with Jonathan's studies and I am persistently practicing shorthand.</t1129><t1130>When we get married, I should be able to help Jonathan; if I know shorthand well enough, I can transcribe what he wants to say and also type it out on the typewriter, which I have also practiced a lot.</t1130><t1131>He and I sometimes correspond in shorthand and he keeps a journal in shorthand during his travels abroad.</t1131><t1132>I will keep a journal in the same way when I am with you.</t1132><t1133>I don't mean those journals where a whole week is squeezed into two pages with Sunday tucked into a corner.</t1133><t1134>I don't think there will be much to interest other people; but these journals are not written for others.</t1134><t1135>If there is something worth sharing, I might show it to Jonathan one day, but it will essentially be a practice notebook.</t1135><t1136>I will try to do what I have seen women journalists do: conduct interviews, write descriptions, and try to remember conversations.</t1136><t1137>I had heard that with a little practice, one can remember everything that happens or is said during the day.</t1137><t1138>Still, we will see.</t1138><t1139>When we get together, I will tell you all my little plans.</t1139><t1140>Just now, I received a few hurried lines from Jonathan from Transylvania.</t1140><t1141>He is well and will be back here in about a week.</t1141><t1142>I am eager to hear all his news.</t1142><t1143>It must be wonderful to see foreign countries.</t1143><t1144>I wonder if we - that is, Jonathan and I - will be able to see these countries together.</t1144><t1145>The ten o'clock bell is ringing.</t1145><t1146>Goodbye.</t1146>

<t1155>Wednesday</t1155>
<t1156>Dearest Mina,</t1156>
<t1157>I must say that you have very unfairly accused me of being a bad pen pal.</t1157><t1158>Since we parted, I have written to you twice, and the last one you sent was only your second letter.</t1158><t1159>Besides, I have nothing to tell you.</t1159><t1160>Seriously, there is nothing that would interest you.</t1160><t1161>The town is very nice these days, and we often visit art galleries, take walks in the park, and go horseback riding.</t1161><t1162>As for the tall, curly-haired man, I think he was the one with me at the last concert.</t1162><t1163>Someone is clearly telling tales.</t1163><t1164>That man was Mr. Holmwood.</t1164><t1165>He often comes to see us; he gets along very well with my mother, and they have a lot to talk about.</t1165><t1166>A while ago, if you weren't already engaged to Jonathan, we met a man who would be perfect for you.</t1166><t1167>A perfect husband candidate; handsome, wealthy, and from a good family.</t1167><t1168>A doctor and really smart.</t1168><t1169>Just think! At only twenty-nine years old, he has a huge mental hospital entirely under his supervision.</t1169><t1170>Mr. Holmwood introduced him to me, he came to visit us, and now he comes often.</t1170><t1171>I think he is one of the bravest and at the same time the most cool-headed men I have ever seen.</t1171><t1172>He definitely looks dignified.</t1172><t1173>I can imagine how he could have perfect control over his patients.</t1173><t1174>He has a strange habit of looking directly into a person's face as if trying to read their mind.</t1174><t1175>He often tries this on me, but I pride myself on thinking he has met his match.</t1175><t1176>I know this from my mirror.</t1176><t1177>Do you ever try to read your own face?</t1177><t1178>I do, and I can tell you, it's not a bad examination, and if you haven't tried it before, it causes you more trouble than you might think.</t1178><t1179>He says I am an interesting psychological case for him to study, and I humbly think so too.</t1179><t1180>As you know, I don't care enough about clothing to describe the latest fashions.</t1180><t1181>Clothing is a nuisance.</t1181><t1182>That's slang, but never mind; Arthur says it every day.</t1182><t1183>That's all.</t1183><t1184>Mina, we've shared all our secrets since childhood; we've slept together, eaten together, cried and laughed together; now, even though I've spoken, I want to talk more.</t1184><t1185>Oh Mina! Can't you guess?</t1185><t1186>I'm in love with him.</t1186><t1187>My face blushes as I write because although I think he loves me too, he hasn't told me in words.</t1187><t1188>But oh! Mina! I'm in love with him; I'm in love with him; I'm in love with him!</t1188><t1189>There, that makes me feel better.</t1189><t1190>I wish I were with you, dear; sitting by the fire with our clothes off as we used to; I would try to tell you how I feel.</t1190><t1191>I don't even know how I'm writing this to you.</t1191><t1192>I'm afraid to stop, or I'll have to tear up the letter, but I don't want to stop because I so much want to tell you everything.</t1192><t1193>I'm eagerly waiting to hear from you; tell me everything you think about this.</t1193><t1194>Mina, I must stop.</t1194><t1195>Good night.</t1195><t1196>Bless me in your prayers and Mina, pray for my happiness.</t1196>

<t1202>Letter to Mina Murray</t1202>
<t1203>24 May</t1203>
<t1204>Dearest Mina,</t1204>
<t1205>Thank you so so so much for your sweet letter!</t1205> <t1206>It was wonderful to be able to tell you and to see your empathy.</t1206>
<t1207>My dear, God gives as He pleases.</t1207> <t1208>How true the old proverbs are.</t1208> <t1209>In September, I will turn twenty, and until today, I have never received a marriage proposal - a real marriage proposal - but today, I received three proposals at once.</t1209> <t1210>Can you imagine! Three marriage proposals in one day!</t1210> <t1211>Terrifying, isn't it!</t1211> <t1212>I feel so sorry for the other two poor men; I really do.</t1212> <t1213>Oh, Mina! I am so happy that I don't know what to do.</t1213> <t1214>And three marriage proposals!</t1214> <t1215>But for God's sake, don't tell the girls, or they'll get all sorts of exaggerated ideas and feel hurt and insignificant if they don't get at least six proposals on the first day they return home.</t1215> <t1216>Some girls are so proud!</t1216> <t1217>You and I, Mina my dear, who are engaged and will soon settle down and live as sensible, old married women, can scorn excessive pride.</t1217> <t1218>Well, I must tell you about this trio, but my dear, you must keep it from everyone - everyone except Jonathan, of course.</t1218> <t1219>You will tell him, because if I were in your place, I would certainly tell Arthur.</t1219> <t1220>A woman should tell her husband everything - don't you think so, my dear - and I must be honest.</t1220> <t1221>Men also want women, especially their wives, to be as honest as they are; I fear women are not always as honest as they should be.</t1221> <t1222>Yes, dear, number one came just before lunch.</t1222> <t1223>I had told you about him, Dr. John Seward; the man from the mental hospital with the strong jaw and beautiful forehead.</t1223> <t1224>He seemed very calm on the outside, but he was nervous.</t1224> <t1225>Clearly, he had trained himself in all sorts of little things and remembered them; but in a way that men usually don't when they are calm, he almost sat on his silk hat and then started playing with his scalpel so much that I almost screamed when he wanted to appear relaxed.</t1225> <t1226>Mina, he spoke very openly with me.</t1226> <t1227>Despite knowing me very little, he told me how important I was to him and how his life would be if I helped and cheered him up.</t1227> <t1228>He was going to say how unhappy he would be if I didn't care for him, but when he saw me crying, he said he was being very rude and wouldn't add to my current troubles.</t1228> <t1229>Then he suddenly stopped and asked if I could grow to love him in time; when I shook my head, his hands trembled, and he hesitantly asked if there was already someone else I loved.</t1229> <t1230>He put it so beautifully; he said he didn't want to force my secret out of me, just wanted to know because if a woman's heart is free, a man can hope.</t1230> <t1231>And then, Mina, I felt it was my duty to tell him there was someone.</t1231> <t1232>I told him as much, he stood up, took both my hands in his and wished me happiness, and told me to consider him one of the best friends if I ever needed one; he looked so strong and serious while saying this.</t1232> <t1233>Oh Mina, my dear, I can't help but cry; you must forgive me for this letter being stained.</t1233> <t1234>Receiving a marriage proposal is wonderful, but having to see a poor man who you know loves you honestly walk away with a broken heart and knowing that no matter what he says at that moment, he is leaving your life, is not a happy thing at all.</t1234> <t1235>My dear, I must stop here for now; although I am very happy, I feel completely shattered.</t1235>
<t1236>Evening</t1236>
<t1237>Arthur has just left, and I am in a better mood than when I paused my letter, so I can continue telling you about what happened today.</t1237><t1238>Well, number two came after lunch.</t1238><t1239>He is such a sweet man; an American from Texas, and he looks so young and fresh that it seems almost impossible for him to have been to so many places and had so many adventures.</t1239><t1240>I share the feelings of poor Desdemona, who had such dangerous things poured into her ears, even if it was by a black man.</t1240><t1241>In my opinion, we women are such cowards that we marry a man thinking he will save us from our fears.</t1241><t1242>If I were a man and wanted a girl to fall in love with me, I now know what I would do.</t1242><t1243>No, I don't know because Mr. Morris told his stories, but Arthur never did, yet - My dear, I think I went a bit too fast.</t1243><t1244>Mr. Quincey P.</t1244><t1245>Morris found me when I was alone.</t1245><t1246>It seems that a man always finds a girl when she is alone.</t1246><t1247>No, that's not true because despite my best efforts to help, Arthur tried twice to get a chance; I am no longer ashamed to say that I helped.</t1247><t1248>First of all, I must tell you that Mr. Morris does not always speak slang - that is, he never does so with strangers or in front of strangers because he is well-educated and has refined manners - but he realized that his American slang amused me, and whenever I was around and there was no one to be bewildered, he would say very funny things.</t1248><t1249>I'm afraid, my dear, he has to make all this up himself, because what he says fits with everything else he needs to say.</t1249><t1250>But that's the way to speak slang anyway.</t1250><t1251>I don't know if I ever speak slang; I don't know if Arthur likes it because I've never heard him use such things before.</t1251><t1252>Anyway, Mr. Morris sat next to me, looking as happy and cheerful as he could; however, I could see that he was very nervous.</t1252><t1253>He took my hand in his and said very sweetly:</t1253>
<t1254>“Miss Lucy, I know I'm not good enough to tie the laces of your little shoes, but if you wait for such a man, when you give up on it, you'll find yourself alongside seven young women who are still waiting without turning off their lights.</t1254> <t1255>Why don't you gather your skirts and come with me; we'll hitch up the double harness and go down this long road together?</t1255><t1256>”</t1256>
<t1257>Eh, he looked so cheerful and happy that rejecting him didn't seem half as hard as rejecting poor Dr. Seward, so I cheerfully said that I didn't know anything about gathering skirts and that I wasn't yet in a position to harness.</t1257> <t1258>Then, he spoke in a cheerful manner and asked me to forgive him if he made a mistake by speaking so about such a serious and important matter for him.</t1258> <t1259>While saying this, he really looked serious, and I couldn't help but become a bit serious myself.</t1259> <t1260>Mina, I know you will think that I am a terrible flirt - still, I couldn't help but be glad that it was the second number in a single day.</t1260> <t1261>And then, my life, before I could say a single word, he began to pour out a perfect flood of love, laying his heart and soul at my feet.</t1261> <t1262>He looked so serious about it that I will never again think that a man, just because he is cheerful at times, must always be playful and can never be serious.</t1262> <t1263>I think he saw something in my face that stopped him, because he suddenly paused and said with manly enthusiasm that if I were free, he could love me:</t1263>
<t1264>“Lucy, you are an honest and brave girl, I know that.</t1264> <t1265>If I didn't believe that you were someone pure to the depths of your soul, I wouldn't be talking to you here like I am now.</t1265> <t1266>Tell me as if we are two good friends, is there someone else you love?</t1266> <t1267>And if there is such a person, I will not bother you in the slightest again, but if you allow, I will be a trustworthy friend to you.</t1267><t1268>”</t1268>
<t1269>Dear Mina, why are men so noble when we women are not at all worthy of them?</t1269> <t1270>I almost mocked this kind-hearted, true gentleman.</t1270> <t1271>I burst into tears - I'm afraid, my dear, you will think this is an overly emotional letter in more ways than one - and I felt genuinely very bad.</t1271> <t1272>Why don't they just allow a girl to have three men at the same time, or as many men as want her, and save all this trouble?</t1272> <t1273>But that would be perverse, and I shouldn't say such things.</t1273> <t1274>Despite my crying, I am happy to say that I was able to look into Mr. Morris's brave eyes and tell him directly:</t1274>
<t1275>“Yes, although she hasn't told me she loves me yet, there is someone I love.”</t1275> <t1276>I had done the right thing by speaking openly with her like this, because her face visibly brightened and she reached out with both hands to hold mine, I think I placed my hand between hers - and she spoke from the heart:</t1276>
<t1277>“Here is my brave girl!</t1277> <t1278>It is better to be late for a chance to win you than to be on time to win another girl in the world.</t1278> <t1279>Don't cry, dear.</t1279> <t1280>If these tears are for me, my tough nut; I face this situation standing.</t1280> <t1281>If the other man is unaware of his happiness, he better find it soon, or else he will find me in his way.</t1281> <t1282>Little girl, your honesty and courage have made me a friend, and this is rarer than a lover; in every situation, more selfless.</t1282> <t1283>Sweetheart, it will be quite a lonely walk between this world and the next for me.</t1283> <t1284>Won't you give me a kiss?</t1284> <t1285>From time to time, it serves to keep the darkness away.</t1285> <t1286>You know, you can do this if you want because that good man -he must be a good man, dear, and a pleasant one, otherwise you wouldn't have fallen in love with him- has not spoken to you yet.”</t1286> <t1287>This convinced me quite a bit, Mina, because saying these things for a rival was very brave and kind and noble behavior -wasn't it- and he was very sad; so I leaned in and kissed him.</t1287> <t1288>He stood up with my hands in his and, looking down into my face -I'm afraid my face was terribly flushed- he said: “Little girl, I hold your hand and you kissed me; if these don't make us friends, nothing will.</t1288> <t1289>Thank you for the honesty you showed me; goodbye.”</t1289> <t1290>He shook my hand strongly, took his hat, and without looking back, without tears, trembling, or hesitation, he walked straight out of the room; but I am crying like a child.</t1290> <t1291>Oh! With so many girls ready to worship the ground he walks on, why should such a man be made unhappy?</t1291> <t1292>If I were free, I would worship him too, I know - but I don't want to be free.</t1292> <t1293>Dear, this makes me very sad and as soon as I tell you this, I feel I cannot speak of happiness; without being completely happy, I don't want to talk about number three to you.</t1293>
<t1294>Always loving you</t1294>
<t1295>LUCY</t1295>
<t1296>Not: Ah, as for number three - I don't need to tell you about number three, do I?</t1296> <t1297>Also, everything was so complicated; it seemed like only a moment had passed between his entrance into the room and him wrapping his arms around me and kissing me.</t1297> <t1298>I am very, very happy and I don't know what I did to deserve this.</t1298> <t1299>In the future, I must try to show that I am not ungrateful to God for sending me such a lover, such a husband, and such a friend.</t1299>

<t1312>In order to learn the truths about his delusions, I interrogated him in a much more comprehensive manner than I had done before.</t1312> <t1313>Now I see that there was a bit of ruthlessness in the way I did it.</t1313> <t1314>It was as if I wanted to keep him at the peak of his madness - which is something I avoid as much as the mouth of hell in patients.</t1314> <t1315>(Note: Under what conditions would I not avoid the pit of hell?)

<t1353>July 24.</t1353> <t1354>Whitby.</t1354> <t1355>- Lucy, looking sweeter and more beautiful than ever, met me at the station and we went by carriage to the house with vacant rooms in Crescent.</t1355> <t1356>This is a very beautiful place.</t1356> <t1357>A small river called Esk flows through a deep valley that widens as it approaches the harbor.</t1357> <t1358>A large bridge on high piers crosses to the other side, and the view between the piers makes it seem farther away than it actually is.</t1358> <t1359>The valley is lush and so steep that, unless you are close enough to look down, you only see the opposite side.</t1359> <t1360>In the old town - the side far from us - all the houses have red roofs and seem to be stacked on top of each other, similar to the pictures we saw in Nuremberg.</t1360> <t1361>Right above the town are the ruins of Whitby Abbey, which was plundered by the Danes and where the part of "Marmion" where the girl is walled up takes place.</t1361> <t1362>An extremely noble, very large, beautiful, and romantic ruin; there is a legend that a white lady has been seen in one of the windows.</t1362> <t1363>There is another church between the town and the abbey; a parish church with a large graveyard full of tombstones around it.</t1363> <t1364>To me, this is the most beautiful spot in Whitby, because it is right above the town and overlooks the entire bay, from the harbor to the headland called Kettleness that stretches out to the sea.</t1364> <t1365>It descends so steeply to the harbor that part of the ground has slipped down, damaging some of the graves.</t1365> <t1366>In one place, the tombstones extend down to the sandy road below.</t1366> <t1367>Along the churchyard, there are walking paths with seats beside them; people go there and sit all day, enjoying the beautiful view and the breeze.</t1367> <t1368>I will often sit and work here too.</t1368> <t1369>In fact, I am writing now with my notebook on my knee, listening to the conversation of three old men sitting next to me.</t1369> <t1370>They seem to do nothing all day but sit here and talk.</t1370>
<t1371>The harbor stretches below, and at the end of the harbor, there is a long granite wall extending into the sea; in the middle of the outward-curving tip, there is a lighthouse.</t1371> <t1372>Outside, a heavy breakwater stretches out.</t1372> <t1373>On the side closer to me, the breakwater makes a reversed elbow, and at its tip, there is also a lighthouse.</t1373> <t1374>Between the two piers, there is a narrow opening leading to the harbor that suddenly widens.</t1374>
<t1375>It's beautiful during the rising tide; but when the waters recede, it looks like nothing and only the Esk remains, flowing here and there between the rocks and the sandy shore.</t1375> <t1376>Outside the harbor, on this side, a wide rocky ridge extends for about eight hundred meters; its steep edge starts right behind the southern lighthouse.</t1376> <t1377>At the end, there is a buoy with a bell that sways in bad weather and sends a mournful sound to the wind.</t1377> <t1378>According to a legend here, whenever a ship is lost at sea, bells are heard.</t1378> <t1379>I should ask the old man about this; he is coming this way.</t1379>
<t1380>A strange old man.</t1380> <t1381>He must be extremely old because his face is entirely gnarled and wrinkled like tree bark.</t1381> <t1382>He tells me that he is almost a hundred years old and that he was a sailor in the Greenland whaling fleet during the Battle of Waterloo.</t1382> <t1383>I'm afraid he's quite skeptical, because when I asked him about the bells at sea and the White Lady of the Monastery, he began to speak with an accent and in a gruff manner:</t1383>
<t1384>“If I were you, I wouldn't bother with these things, young lady.</t1384> <t1385>All of this is outdated.</t1385> <t1386>Look, I'm not saying they never existed, but they didn't exist in my time.</t1386> <t1387>These tales might be good for tourists and such, but not for a lovely young lady like you.</t1387> <t1388>People who come from York and Leeds, constantly eating smoked herring and drinking tea, looking to buy cheap black amber, they believe in this.</t1388> <t1389>I wonder who would go to the trouble of lying to these people - and even to newspapers filled with nonsense.”</t1389> <t1390>I thought this old man might be someone from whom I could learn interesting things, so I asked if he would mind telling me something about whaling in the old days.</t1390> <t1391>He was just about to start when the clock struck six, upon which he struggled to stand up and said:</t1391>
<t1392>"I must get moving to go home now, young lady.</t1392> <t1393>My grandson doesn't like to be kept waiting when the tea is ready because it takes me a while to get down the stairs - there are so many of them; and young lady, when the time comes, I get very hungry.</t1393><t1394>"</t1394>
<t1395>He limped away, down the stairs, and I could see him descending as quickly as he could.</t1395> <t1396>The stairs are one of the important features of this place.</t1396> <t1397>They go from the town to the church; there are hundreds of steps - I don't know how many - and they turn with a gentle curve; the incline is so slight that a horse can easily go up and down.</t1397> <t1398>I think they originally had some connection with the Monastery.</t1398> <t1399>I should go home too.</t1399> <t1400>Lucy had gone to pay visits with her mother, and since these visits were out of duty, I did not go.</t1400> <t1401>They must have returned home by now.</t1401>
<t1402>July 25.</t1402> <t1403>- I came here with Lucy an hour ago; we had a very interesting conversation with my old friend and the other two who always come here and join him.</t1403> <t1404>Clearly, the group's Mr. Prophecy17 is my old friend; I think he was quite a domineering person in his time.</t1404> <t1405>He wouldn't accept anything and would snap at everyone.</t1405> <t1406>If he couldn't prevail in a debate, he would bully, and then he would see the silence of his opponents as a sign of agreement with his thoughts.</t1406> <t1407>Lucy looked very elegant and beautiful in her white, thin linen dress; she has gotten a nice color since she came here.</t1407> <t1408>As soon as we sat down, I noticed that the old men didn't waste any time getting up to sit close to her.</t1408> <t1409>Lucy is so sweet to old people; I think they immediately fell in love with her.</t1409> <t1410>Even my old man couldn't resist and didn't clash with her, but instead doubled my share.</t1410> <t1411>I caught him on the subject of legends and he immediately started a speech-like talk.</t1411> <t1412>I should try to remember what he said and put it down on paper:</t1412>
<t1413>“It's all nonsense, from top to bottom; that's it, nothing else.</t1413> <t1414>All these curses, ghosts, bogeymen, and everything related to them are things suitable for children and foolish women to believe in.</t1414> <t1415>Nothing but soap bubbles!</t1415> <t1416>All these horrors, signs, and warnings are concocted by priests, malicious educated people, and railway barkers to scare half-wits and to make people do things they wouldn't otherwise be inclined to do.</t1416> <t1417>Thinking about them makes me angry.</t1417> <t1418>The lies they print in newspapers, the lies they preach from the pulpit aren't enough; they also want to carve them onto gravestones.</t1418> <t1419>Look around you, all the stones seem to be proudly lifting their heads, but in reality, they are toppling under the weight of the lies written on them; on all of them, it says, ‘Here lies the body of so-and-so’ or, ‘In sacred memory of so-and-so,’ but half of them don't contain any bodies; and they are neither sacred, nor does anyone care about their memory.</t1419> <t1420>It's all lies, all lies in one way or another!</t1420> <t1421>My God, on Judgment Day, what a mess it will be when they try to drag their gravestones, struggling to hold onto them with their slippery hands from being in the sea for so long, to prove how good they were.</t1421><t1422>”</t1422>
<t1423>I could see from the old man's confident demeanor and the way he looked around for approval from his friends that he was "showing off," so I interrupted him to keep him talking:</t1423>
<t1424>"Oh! Mr. Swales, you can't be serious.</t1424> <t1425>Surely, not all these tombstones are fake, are they?</t1425><t1426>"</t1426>
<t1427>“It is possible! There may be very few who are not fake, except for those who make people look better than they are; because there are people who will believe that a bowl of liquid is the ocean as long as it belongs to them.</t1427> <t1428>All of this is a lie.</t1428> <t1429>Look over there; you came here as a stranger, you see this churchyard.”</t1429> <t1430>I nodded because, although I didn't understand his dialect very well, I thought it would be better to agree.</t1430> <t1431>I knew it had something to do with the church.</t1431> <t1432>He continued: “And you think all these stones are about the people buried here, don't you?”</t1432> <t1433>I nodded again.</t1433> <t1434>“Here's the lie, this is where it comes into play.</t1434> <t1435>Here, there are as many beds as there are people filling old Dun’s place on Friday nights.”</t1435> <t1436>He nudged one of his companions with his elbow and they all laughed together.</t1436> <t1437>“And my God! How could it be otherwise?</t1437> <t1438>Look at that, read that one over there!” I went over and read:</t1438>
<t1439>“Edward Spencelagh, a former sailor, was killed by pirates on the shores of Andres in April 1854, at the age of 30.” When I returned, Mr. Swales continued his words:</t1439>
<t1440>“I wonder who brought him home for burial.</t1440> <t1441>He was killed off the coast of Andres!</t1441> <t1442>You also thought his body was buried here!</t1442> <t1443>I can count a dozen people for you whose bones lie in the Greenland Sea above,” he pointed north, “or wherever the currents have carried them.</t1443> <t1444>Their tombstones stand around you.</t1444> <t1445>You can read the lies written in small letters with your own eyes from here.</t1445> <t1446>This is Braithwaite Lowrey - I knew his father - lost off Lively in Greenland in '20; or Andrew Woodhouse, drowned in the same seas in 1777; or John Paxton, drowned off Cape Farewell a year later; or old John Rawlings, who sailed with me, drowned in the Gulf of Finland in '50.</t1446> <t1447>Do you think all these men will have to rush to Whitby when the trumpet of Israfil sounds?</t1447> <t1448>I doubt it!</t1448> <t1449>Let me tell you, when they come here, they will jostle and shove, just like the fights we had on the ice in the old days; from morning till night, we would get into it and try to tend to our wounds under the polar lights.”</t1449> <t1450>Clearly, this was a local joke because the old man laughed, and his companions joined him with pleasure.</t1450>
<t1451>"But," I said, "I think you are not quite right because you are acting on the assumption that all poor people or their souls will have to carry their tombstones on 'Judgment Day.'</t1451> <t1452>Do you really think this will be necessary?</t1452><t1453>"</t1453>
<t1454>“Eh, what other purpose could gravestones have?</t1454> <t1455>Answer me, young lady!</t1455><t1456>”</t1456>
<t1457>“To make their relatives happy, I think.</t1457><t1458>”</t1458>
<t1459>“To make your relatives happy, you think!”</t1459> <t1460>He said this with great disdain.</t1460> <t1461>“How will knowing that lies are written about them and that everyone here knows these are lies make your relatives happy?” He pointed to a stone lying on its side near the edge of the yard, forming the base of the bench above it.</t1461> <t1462>“Read what is written on that horizontal tombstone.”</t1462> <t1463>From where I was sitting, the letters appeared upside down, but Lucy saw them more upright from her position, so she leaned in and began to read:</t1463>
<t1464>“In sacred memory of George Canon, who fell from the cliffs at Kettleness on July 29, 1873, in the hope of a glorious resurrection.”</t1464> <t1465>This grave was erected by his grieving mother for her beloved son.</t1465> <t1466>He was his mother's only son, and the poor woman was a widow.</t1466> <t1467>“Really, Mr. Swales?</t1467> <t1468>I don't see anything to laugh about in this!” She expressed her comment with great seriousness and a bit of sternness.</t1468>
<t1469>"So you see nothing to laugh about!</t1469> <t1470>Ha! Ha! Because you don't know that the grieving mother was a witch who hated her son because he was crippled -lame- and that he hated her so much that he committed suicide to prevent her from getting the money from the life insurance she had taken out for him.</t1470> <t1471>He blew his head off with the gun they used to scare away the crows.</t1471> <t1472>So it wasn't for the crows, because it gathered flies and carrion crows around him.</t1472> <t1473>This is how he fell from the cliffs.</t1473> <t1474>And as for his hopes of a glorious resurrection, personally, I had often heard him say that he hoped to go to Hell frequently because his mother was very religious and would surely go to Heaven, and he didn't want to be where she was.</t1474> <t1475>Now this stone," -he was hitting the stone with his cane as he spoke- "isn't it a pile of lies no matter what?</t1475> <t1476>And when Geordie comes out of breath through the trees with the tombstone on his back and asks for the stone to be taken as evidence, won't it make Gabriel chuckle?</t1476><t1477>"</t1477>
<t1478>I didn't know what to say, but Lucy changed the subject as she stood up:</t1478>
<t1479>“Ah! Why did you tell us this?</t1479> <t1480>This is my favorite bench and I can't leave it; but now I learn that I will continue to sit on the grave of someone who committed suicide.</t1480><t1481>”</t1481>
<t1482>“This won't harm you, my dear; knowing that someone so elegant is sitting on his lap would make poor Geordie happy.</t1482> <t1483>It won't harm you.</t1483> <t1484>I've been sitting here from time to time for almost twenty years, and it hasn't harmed me.</t1484> <t1485>Don't worry about the lies lying beneath you or not!</t1485> <t1486>It will take quite a while until you see all the tombstones fleeing and this whole place left as empty as a stubble field.</t1486> <t1487>There, the clock is striking, I must go.</t1487> <t1488>Always at your service, ladies!” And he limped away.</t1488>
<t1489>We sat with Lucy for a while; the view in front of us was so beautiful that we held hands while sitting; she told me again and again about Arthur and their upcoming marriage.</t1489> <t1490>This saddened me a bit, because I haven't heard from Jonathan for a whole month.</t1490>
<t1491>The same day.</t1491> <t1492>- I came here alone because I am very sad.</t1492> <t1493>There was no letter for me.</t1493> <t1494>I hope Jonathan has no problems.</t1494> <t1495>The clock has just struck nine.</t1495> <t1496>I see lights scattered over the whole town; sometimes in rows along the roads and sometimes individually; to the right, they stretch along the Esk and disappear in the curve of the valley.</t1496> <t1497>The view to my left is cut off by a black line belonging to the roof of the house next to the Monastery.</t1497> <t1498>Sheep and lambs are bleating in the distant fields behind me, and the clatter of a donkey's hooves can be heard from the asphalt road.</t1498> <t1499>The band on the pier is playing a fast, ear-piercing waltz, and in one of the back streets beyond the pier, a Salvation Army meeting is being held.</t1499> <t1500>Neither band can hear the other, but here, up above, I can hear and see both.</t1500> <t1501>I wonder where Jonathan is and if he is thinking of me!</t1501> <t1502>I wish he were here.</t1502>
<t1503>Dr. Seward's journal</t1503>
<t1504>June 5.</t1504> <t1505>- The Renfield case is becoming more interesting as I understand the man better.</t1505> <t1506>He has some highly developed qualities: Selfishness, reticence, and determination.</t1506> <t1507>I wish I could understand what his determination is directed towards.</t1507> <t1508>He seems to have a specific plan of his own, but I don't know what it is yet.</t1508> <t1509>His love for animals is one of his good qualities, but he has such unprecedented tendencies in this regard that sometimes I think the man possesses a mere perverse cruelty.</t1509> <t1510>He has peculiar kinds of pets.</t1510> <t1511>His current hobby is catching flies.</t1511> <t1512>At present, he has so many flies that I felt compelled to personally warn him.</t1512> <t1513>I was surprised to see that, as I expected, he did not have a fit of rage and took the matter seriously.</t1513> <t1514>He thought for a moment and said, “Will you give me three days?</t1514> <t1515>I will get rid of them.”</t1515> <t1516>Of course, I said I could give him that time.</t1516> <t1517>I must keep an eye on him.</t1517>
<t1518>June 18.</t1518> <t1519>- Now he is obsessed with spiders and has a box full of large spiders.</t1519> <t1520>He feeds them with flies, and although he uses half of his food to attract flies outside his room, the number of flies has reasonably decreased.</t1520>
<t1521>July 1st.</t1521> <t1522>- Now the spiders have also become as big a problem as the flies, and today I told him that he needed to get rid of the spiders.</t1522> <t1523>He was very upset to hear this, so I told him that he still needed to clean up some of them.</t1523> <t1524>He accepted this cheerfully, and I gave him the same amount of time I had given him before to reduce their number.</t1524> <t1525>When I was with him, he made me feel terribly nauseous, because when a disgusting, bloated horsefly that had been feeding on rotting meat buzzed into the room, he caught it, held it joyfully between his fingers for a few seconds, and before I could understand what he was going to do, he put it in his mouth and ate it.</t1525> <t1526>I scolded him for this, but he calmly argued that the fly was very tasty and nutritious; that it meant life - strong life - and it gave him life.</t1526> <t1527>This gave me an idea or at least a fragment of an idea.</t1527> <t1528>I should watch how he gets rid of his spiders.</t1528> <t1529>Clearly, he has a serious problem in his mind, because he keeps a notebook in which he constantly scribbles something.</t1529> <t1530>As if, in the words of the auditors, he is "focusing" on an account, all the pages of the notebook are filled with heaps of numbers, mostly gathered in clusters, consisting of odd numbers; then he adds these totals together in clusters as well.</t1530>
<t1531>8 July.</t1531> <t1532>- There is a method in his madness, and the thought in my mind is maturing.</t1532> <t1533>Soon it will be a complete idea, and then, oh, unconscious thought!</t1533> <t1534>You must bow to your conscious brother.</t1534> <t1535>I stayed away from my friend for a few days so that I might notice if there was any difference.</t1535> <t1536>Everything was the same except that he had parted with some of his pets and acquired a new one.</t1536> <t1537>He had managed to obtain a sparrow and had even partially tamed it.</t1537> <t1538>The method of taming was simple, for the number of spiders had already decreased.</t1538> <t1539>The remaining ones were well-fed, for he was still offering them the flies he lured with his food.</t1539>
<t1540>July 19.</t1540> <t1541>- We are making progress.</t1541> <t1542>My friend now has a complete sparrow colony, and with it, the flies and spiders are almost entirely gone.</t1542> <t1543>When I entered, he ran to me and said he wanted a big favor - a very, very big favor; he was fawning like a dog as he spoke.</t1543> <t1544>I asked him what he wanted; with a kind of ecstasy in his voice and manner, he said:</t1544>
<t1545>“A kitten, a small, cute, shiny-furred, playful kitten that I can play with, train, and feed -and feed- and feed.”</t1545> <t1546>I was not caught unprepared by this request, as I had noticed that the size and liveliness of her pets were increasing, but I did not care about the fact that the lovely pet sparrow family would be gone in the same way as flies and spiders; therefore, I said I would take care of it and asked if she wanted an adult cat instead of a kitten.</t1546> <t1547>Her greed betrayed her as she replied:</t1547>
<t1548>“Ah! Yes! I want a cat!</t1548> <t1549>The only reason I asked for a kitten was to see if you would refuse to give me one.</t1549> <t1550>No one refuses to give me a kitten, right?”</t1550> <t1551>I shook my head and said that I was afraid it was impossible at the moment but that I would look into it.</t1551> <t1552>His face fell; I could see an expression of danger warning on his face because suddenly, a merciless, sideways glance that meant killing settled on his face.</t1552> <t1553>This man is an undeveloped, homicidal maniac.</t1553> <t1554>I must test him with his current request and see how it turns out; then I will learn more.</t1554>
<t1555>It's 10 PM.</t1555> <t1556>- I visited him once more and found him sitting in a corner, lost in deep thoughts.</t1556> <t1557>When I entered, he knelt before me and begged for permission to feed a cat; he said his salvation depended on it.</t1557> <t1558>However, I was determined and told him he couldn't feed the cat, upon which he walked away without a word and went to the corner where I had found him, sitting and gnawing at his fingers.</t1558> <t1559>I will see him early tomorrow morning.</t1559>
<t1560>July 20.</t1560> <t1561>- Before the nurse made her morning rounds, I visited Renfield very early in the morning.</t1561> <t1562>I found him standing, humming a tune.</t1562> <t1563>He was spreading the sugar he had collected on the window and was clearly starting to catch flies again; he began this task with joy and a certain dignity.</t1563> <t1564>I looked around for his birds and, not seeing them, asked where they were.</t1564> <t1565>Without turning around, he said they had all flown away.</t1565> <t1566>There were a few scattered feathers in the room and a drop of blood on his pillow.</t1566> <t1567>I didn't say anything, but I went to the nurse and told her to inform me if there was anything unusual about Renfield during the day.</t1567>
<t1568>It's 11 in the morning.</t1568> <t1569>- The nurse came to me to say that Renfield was very sick and had vomited a ton of bird feathers.</t1569> <t1570>“I think, doctor,” he said, “he ate his birds, took his birds and ate them raw!</t1570><t1571>”</t1571>
<t1572>It's 11 PM.</t1572> <t1573>- This evening, I gave Renfield a sedative strong enough to make him sleep and took his small notebook to examine.</t1573> <t1574>The thought that was ringing in my head has recently been completed, and my theory has been proven.</t1574> <t1575>My homicidal lunatic is of a special kind.</t1575> <t1576>I need to discover a new classification for him and define him as a zoophagous (life-eating) lunatic; what he desires is to absorb as much life as possible and to work tirelessly to do so in an accumulative manner.</t1576> <t1577>He gave many flies to a spider, many spiders to a bird, and then asked for a cat to eat many birds.</t1577> <t1578>What could his next steps be?</t1578> <t1579>It was almost worth completing the experiment.</t1579> <t1580>If there were sufficient justification, it could be done.</t1580> <t1581>People ridicule experiments on living beings, but look at their results today!</t1581> <t1582>Why not advance science in the most difficult and crucial aspect - the knowledge of the brain?</t1582> <t1583>If I could unlock the secret of such a brain - if I had the key to the imagination of a single lunatic - I could elevate my field of science to a pinnacle where Burdon-Sanderson's physiology and Ferrier's brain knowledge would pale in comparison.</t1583> <t1584>If only there were sufficient justification!</t1584> <t1585>I must not think about this too much, or I will be tempted; a good justification could point the needle toward me, for am I not, by nature, an extraordinary brain?</t1585>
<t1586>How beautifully humans reason!</t1586> <t1587>Madmen always do this within themselves.</t1587> <t1588>I wonder how many lives a person values, if such a thing exists.</t1588> <t1589>He closed the account very accurately and started a new page today.</t1589> <t1590>How many of us start a new page in our lives every day?</t1590>
<t1591>Just yesterday, it felt as if my entire life had ended along with my new hope, and indeed, I started a new chapter.</t1591> <t1592>This will continue until the Great Judge tallies my total and closes my main ledger with a balance of profit or loss.</t1592> <t1593>Ah! Lucy! Lucy! I cannot be angry with you or with my friend whose happiness is your happiness; but all I can do is wait and work in despair.</t1593> <t1594>Work! Work!</t1594>
<t1595>I wish I had as strong a reason as my poor mad friend there; a good and selfless reason to make me work; that would truly be my happiness.</t1595>

<t1597>July 26.</t1597> <t1598>- I am anxious and expressing myself here calms me; it's like whispering to oneself and listening at the same time.</t1598> <t1599>Also, there is something in the shorthand symbols that sets it apart from regular writing.</t1599> <t1600>I am unhappy about Lucy and Jonathan.</t1600> <t1601>I hadn't heard from Jonathan for a while and was worried; but yesterday, dear Mr. Hawkins, who has always been very kind, sent me a letter from him.</t1601> <t1602>I had asked him if he had heard from Jonathan, and he said that the enclosed letter had just arrived.</t1602> <t1603>The letter was a single line written from Castle Dracula, saying that he was about to set off for home.</t1603> <t1604>This is not at all like Jonathan; I don't understand anything and this situation makes me very uneasy.</t1604> <t1605>Then, Lucy, although she is actually very well, has recently reverted to her old sleepwalking habit.</t1605> <t1606>Her mother told me about this and we decided to lock our room door every night.</t1606> <t1607>Mrs. Westenra thinks that sleepwalkers always go up to the roofs of houses, walk along the edges of cliffs, and then suddenly wake up and fall down with a desperate scream that echoes everywhere.</t1607> <t1608>Poor thing, she is naturally worried about Lucy; and she tells me that her husband, that is, Lucy's father, had the same habit and would get up, dress, and go out at night if not stopped.</t1608> <t1609>Lucy will get married in the fall; she is already planning her clothes and how her house should be arranged.</t1609> <t1610>I understand her because I am doing the same, only Jonathan and I will start life from a much simpler place and try to make ends meet.</t1610> <t1611>Mr. Holmwood - that is, the Honorable Arthur Holmwood, the only son of Lord Godalming - is coming here very soon, as soon as he manages to leave town, because his father is not very well; I think dear Lucy is counting the seconds until he arrives.</t1611> <t1612>She wants to take him to the bench on the hill in the churchyard and show him the beauty of Whitby.</t1612> <t1613>I can tell that what bothers her is the waiting; she will be fine when Mr. Holmwood arrives.</t1613>
<t1614>July 27.</t1614> <t1615>- No news from Jonathan.</t1615> <t1616>Although I don't know why I should be, I am getting increasingly worried about him; I keep thinking that I wish he would write something, even if it's just a single line.</t1616> <t1617>Lucy is walking more than ever and I wake up every night to her movements in the room.</t1617> <t1618>Fortunately, the weather is so hot that it's impossible for her to catch a cold; but still, the anxiety I feel and the constant waking up are affecting me badly; I am nervous and sleepless.</t1618> <t1619>Thank God, Lucy's health is good.</t1619> <t1620>Mr. Holmwood was suddenly called to Ring to see his father, who has become seriously ill.</t1620> <t1621>Lucy is sad about the postponement of seeing him, but this situation does not affect her appearance; she has gained a little weight and her cheeks have turned a beautiful rosy pink.</t1621>
<t1622>There is no trace left of the previous pale appearance.</t1622> <t1623>I pray that it continues this way.</t1623>
<t1624>August 3rd.</t1624> <t1625>- Another week has passed and still no news from Jonathan, even mr Hawkins, who writes to me, hasn't heard anything.</t1625> <t1626>Oh! I hope he is not ill.</t1626> <t1627>I am looking at his last letter, but somehow it doesn't satisfy me.</t1627> <t1628>It's not his style at all, but it's his handwriting.</t1628> <t1629>There is no doubt about that.</t1629> <t1630>In the past week, Lucy hasn't walked much in her sleep, but lately, there is a strange intensity about her; she seems to be watching me even in her sleep.</t1630> <t1631>She tries the door and when she sees it's locked, she wanders around the room looking for the key.</t1631>
<t1632>August 6.</t1632> <t1633>- Three more days have passed, no news.</t1633> <t1634>This uncertainty has started to become terrifying.</t1634> <t1635>If I knew where to write or where to go, I would feel more at ease; but since that last letter, no one has heard a single word from Jonathan.</t1635> <t1636>I must pray to God to give me patience.</t1636> <t1637>Lucy gets excited more easily than ever, but other than that, she is fine.</t1637> <t1638>Last night was very frightening, and the fishermen said that a storm was inevitable.</t1638> <t1639>I must watch and learn the signs in the air.</t1639> <t1640>Today is a gray day, and as I write these, the sun is hidden behind thick clouds over Kettleness.</t1640> <t1641>Everything is gray - except for the green grass that looks like emerald among the grays - gray earthy rock; gray clouds leaning over the gray sea where the sand dunes stretch out like gray fingers, slightly colored by the sunlight in the distance.</t1641> <t1642>The sea falls over the beach and sandy areas, choking and roaring as it accumulates inland.</t1642> <t1643>The horizon has disappeared into a gray mist.</t1643> <t1644>Everything is vast; the clouds are piled up like gigantic rocks, and there is a sound over the sea that comes like a sign of doom to the ears.</t1644> <t1645>On the beach, here and there, there are dark shapes sometimes half-hidden in the mists, giving the impression of "trees walking like men."</t1645> <t1646>The fishing boats are racing to return home, bobbing up and down in the ground swell as they drift towards the harbor, tilting from side to side as if about to sink.</t1646> <t1647>Here comes old Mr. Swales.</t1647> <t1648>He is coming directly towards me, and from the way he lifts his hat, I understand he wants to talk...</t1648>
<t1649>I was quite affected by the change in the poor old man.</t1649> <t1650>When he sat next to me, he said very kindly:</t1650>
<t1651>"I want to tell you something, young lady."</t1651> <t1652>I could see that she didn't feel comfortable, so I took her poor old wrinkled hand in mine and asked her to explain everything in detail; thus, holding her hand in mine, she said:</t1652>
<t1653>“I fear, my child, that I must have shaken you with the bad things I said about the dead and similar matters last week; but I didn't actually mean it that way, and I want you to remember this when I am gone.</t1653> <t1654>We, the cracked old folks with one foot in the grave, do not want to think about this matter at all and fear it; that is why I make light of it, so that I can ease my heart a little.</t1654> <t1655>But God bless you, little lady, I am not afraid of dying, not at all; only, if I could help it, I wouldn't want to die.</t1655> <t1656>My time must be approaching now, because I am old and a hundred years is far more than one can expect; I am so close to death that the Old Man has already started sharpening his scythe.</t1656> <t1657>You see, I can't break the habit of joking all at once.</t1657> <t1658>Soon, one day, the angel of death will come for me.</t1658> <t1659>But don't be sad, my child,” because he had seen me crying - “if he were to come tonight, I would not refuse to answer his call.</t1659> <t1660>Because life is just waiting for something other than what we do, and the only thing we can truly rely on is death.</t1660> <t1661>But I am content with this because it is coming for me, and it is coming swiftly, my child.</t1661> <t1662>It may come while we are looking and wondering.</t1662> <t1663>Perhaps, it is coming with the wind over the sea, bringing along lost things, shipwrecks, tension, and sad hearts.</t1663> <t1664>Look! Look!” he suddenly shouted.</t1664> <t1665>“There is something in that wind that looks like, tastes like, and smells like death.</t1665> <t1666>In the air; I feel it coming.</t1666> <t1667>God, let me respond with joy when my time comes!” He raised his arms to the sky with all his heart and took off his hat.</t1667> <t1668>His mouth moved as if he were praying.</t1668> <t1669>After a few minutes of silence, he stood up, shook hands with me, blessed me, bid farewell, and limped away.</t1669> <t1670>All this touched me deeply and left me in turmoil.</t1670>
<t1671>I was pleased when the coast guard came to me with his small binoculars under his arm.</t1671> <t1672>As usual, he stopped to talk to me, but he kept looking at a strange ship.</t1672>
<t1673>“I couldn't make out what it was,” he said; “judging by its appearance, it looks like a Russian ship; but it's drifting in a very strange manner.</t1673> <t1674>It seems undecided about what to do; as if it sees the approaching storm but can't decide whether to head north, out to the open sea, or enter the harbor here.</t1674> <t1675>Look, there it goes again! It's moving very oddly because it doesn't heed the hand on the helm; it changes direction with every gust of wind.</t1675> <t1676>By this time tomorrow, we'll hear more about it.</t1676><t1677>”</t1677>

<t1680>(Pasted into Mina Murray's journal.</t1680><t1681>)</t1681>
<t1682>From a reporter</t1682>
<t1683>Whitby</t1683>
<t1684>With its strange and unique results, the largest and most sudden storm on record occurred here.</t1684> <t1685>The weather was quite hot and humid, but it was not unusual for the month of August.</t1685> <t1686>Saturday evening was one of the best-known days, and the holiday crowd had planned visits to Mulgrave Woods, Robin Hood's Bay, Rig Mill, Runswick, Staithes, and various trips to places near Whitby for yesterday.</t1686> <t1687>The steamships named Emma and Scarborough were making excursion trips up and down the coastline, and there was an unusual number of "tour trips" coming to and departing from Whitby.</t1687> <t1688>In the afternoon, some regulars who often visited the East Cliff Churchyard and were accustomed to watching the vast sea stretching to the north and east from the first-class viewpoint noted the sudden appearance of "mare's tails" in the northwest, until then the day had been unusually beautiful.</t1688> <t1689>At that time, the wind was blowing lightly from the southwest, which in barometer terms is classified as a "force two light breeze."</t1689> <t1690>The coastguard on duty immediately prepared a report, and an old fisherman who had been observing the weather indicators at East Cliff for over half a century emphatically announced that an unexpected storm was about to break.</t1690> <t1691>The arrival of sunset was so beautiful, so majestic among the gloriously colored cloud formations, that a crowd had gathered on the cliffside path of the old churchyard to enjoy this beauty.</t1691> <t1692>Before the sun set beneath the landmass of Kettleness, as it boldly stood against the western sky, the descending path was painted with endless colors - every shade of fiery red, purple, pink, green, violet, and gold; alongside huge shadows here and there, all kinds of small but visible land shapes could be seen.</t1692> <t1693>The experience did not fail to impress the painters, and some sketches of the "Great Storm Before" will undoubtedly honor the walls of the Royal Academy and the Royal Institute next May.</t1693> <t1694>More than one captain immediately decided that the "cobble" or "cutter" (as they called different classes of ships) should stay in the harbor until the storm subsided.</t1694> <t1695>By evening, the wind had completely died down, and by midnight, the oppressive heat and the intense silence that precedes a storm, affecting sensitive people, had set in.</t1695> <t1696>At sea, there were very few lights visible because even the steamships that "hugged" the coast closely had moved far out, and only a few fishing boats were in sight.</t1696> <t1697>The only visible sailing ship appeared to be a foreign schooner heading west with all its sails set.</t1697> <t1698>During the time it remained in view, the recklessness and ignorance of the sailors on board became a fruitful topic of commentary, and efforts were made to signal it to lower its sails in the face of danger.</t1698> <t1699>Before night fully set in, it was seen gently rising and falling on the waves of the sea, its sails flapping idly:</t1699>
<t1700>In a painted sea, painted</t1700>
<t1701>adrift like a ship.</t1701> <t1702>18</t1702>
<t1703>Shortly before ten o'clock, the calmness of the air became quite oppressive; the silence was so pronounced that the bleating of a lamb inland and the barking of a dog in the town could be clearly heard, and the lively French melody played by the band on the quay clashed with the great harmony created by nature's silence.</t1703> <t1704>Shortly after midnight, a strange sound came from the sea, and the air carried a peculiar, indistinct, and deep rumbling from above.</t1704>
<t1705>Then, suddenly, a storm broke out.</t1705><t1706>At that moment, it was at an unimaginable speed, even impossible to comprehend afterward; suddenly, nature had begun to shake entirely.</t1706><t1707>The waves were rising with increasing fury, each one surpassing the previous one; until, in just a few minutes, the sea that had looked like glass turned into a roaring and all-consuming monster.</t1707><t1708>The white-capped waves were madly pounding the sands at sea level and rising towards the sloping cliffs; others were crashing into the pier and washing the lighthouses at the ends of each of the Whitby Harbor piers with their foam.</t1708><t1709>The wind was roaring like a storm and blowing with such force that even strong men could barely stand or had to hold onto iron poles tightly.</t1709><t1710>It became clear that it was necessary to clear the piers of the crowds of spectators, otherwise the deadly events of the night would multiply.</t1710><t1711>In addition to the difficulties and dangers of the moment, masses of fog from the sea were drifting inland - ghostly white, wet clouds; so wet, damp, and cold that it didn't take much imagination to think that the souls lost at sea were touching their friends with the cold hand of death; many shivered as the sea fog rolled in waves.</t1711><t1712>From time to time, the fog would clear, and under the light of lightning followed by sudden thunderclaps that made the sky above us seem to tremble in astonishment at the storm's steps, the sea could be seen from afar.</t1712><t1713>Therefore, part of the emerging scene was immeasurably magnificent and interesting - the sea rising like a mountain, throwing masses of white foam skyward with each wave, and the storm seemed to be carrying them into space; here and there, a fishing boat with tattered sails was frantically hurrying to find shelter before the storm fully broke; occasionally, the white wings of a sea bird thrown by the storm could be seen.</t1713><t1714>The new beacon at the top of East Cliff was ready for the experiment, but it had never been tested before.</t1714><t1715>The officials responsible for it got to work and scanned the sea surface with the beacon during the intervals given by the fog rushing inland.</t1715><t1716>Once or twice, it worked very well; for instance, a fishing boat with its bulwark underwater managed to quickly enter the harbor, avoiding the danger of crashing into the piers thanks to its guiding light.</t1716><t1717>With each boat reaching the safety of the harbor, a cheer of joy rose from the crowd on the shore; this cheer momentarily interrupted the storm and then seemed to be lifted off the ground within its speed.</t1717><t1718>Soon, the beacon spotted a schooner with all sails set ahead; it was evidently the boat noticed earlier in the evening.</t1718><t1719>By this time, the wind had turned east, and a shudder ran through the spectators on the cliffs as they realized the terrible danger the boat was now in.</t1719><t1720>Between the ship and the harbor lay a flat rock where many good ships had struggled from time to time, and with the current wind direction, it seemed almost impossible for the ship to find the harbor entrance.</t1720><t1721>It was almost time for the tide to rise, but the waves were so large that the shallow areas along the shore were nearly visible in the troughs between them; the schooner with all sails set was advancing at such a speed that, as the old sailors said, "Even if it were Hell, it was certain to reach somewhere."</t1721><t1722>Then came a wave of sea fog larger than any seen so far - a damp and cold mass of fog covering everything like a gray shroud and leaving people with only their sense of hearing; only their sense of hearing remained because the roar of the storm, the rumble of thunder, and the roar of the great waves came through the damp nothingness even stronger than before.</t1722><t1723>The beacon's rays were fixed on the harbor mouth at the East Pier where the collision was expected, and the men held their breath and waited.</t1723><t1724>The wind suddenly turned northeast, and the remnants of the sea fog melted away with the breeze; then, mirabile dictu, between the piers, a strange schooner with all sails set reached the safety of the harbor at breakneck speed before the collision.</t1724><t1725>The beacon followed it, and everyone who saw the ship was horrified because a corpse with its head bowed was tied to the helm, and with each movement of the ship, the head of the corpse was swinging back and forth in a ghastly manner.</t1725><t1726>No one else was visible on deck.</t1726><t1727>When they realized that the ship had miraculously found the harbor guided only by the hand of a dead man, a great fear fell upon everyone!</t1727><t1728>However, all this happened in a much shorter time than it takes to write these words.</t1728><t1729>The schooner did not stop and quickly advanced in the harbor, grounding on the sand and gravel pile known to the locals as Tate Hill Pier, which jutted out under East Cliff, washed by many tides and storms.</t1729>
<t1730>Of course, when the ship reached the sandbank, there was a great jolt.</t1730> <t1731>Every mast, every rope, every stay was strained, and part of the cargo on the deck spilled onto the ground.</t1731> <t1732>But the strangest thing was that as soon as the ship touched the shore, a huge dog appeared on the lower deck as if it had been thrown by the impact and leapt from the ship's bow onto the sand.</t1732> <t1733>Directly, it headed towards the steep hill where the soil from the top had fallen down, exposing some gravestones - known locally in Whitby as "yard stones" or "long stones" due to their horizontal position caused by the steepness - disappearing into the darkness that seemed to concentrate just beyond the focus of the lighthouse.</t1733>
<t1734>By chance, there was no one at Tate Hill Wharf at that time because everyone who lived nearby was either in their beds or up on the hills.</t1734> <t1735>Therefore, the coast guard on duty on the east side of the harbor, who ran to the small wharf below, was the first person to board the ship.</t1735> <t1736>After the men operating the searchlight scanned the harbor entrance without seeing anything, they turned the light towards the shipwreck and kept it there.</t1736> <t1737>The coast guard ran to the stern of the ship, and when he reached the helm, he bent down to examine it and immediately pulled back as if struck by a sudden emotion.</t1737> <t1738>This situation aroused public curiosity, and a large number of people began to run.</t1738> <t1739>West Cliff is quite a distance from Tate Hill Wharf via the suspension bridge, but your reporter is a fairly good runner and reached the ship before the crowd.</t1739> <t1740>However, when I arrived, I saw that a crowd had already gathered on the wharf, and the coast guard and police were not allowing them to board the ship.</t1740> <t1741>With the permission of the chief sailor, I was allowed to board the deck as your reporter and joined the small group who saw the dead sailor tied to the helm.</t1741>
<t1742>The coast guard officer being surprised, even scared, is not for nothing because such a scene is rarely seen.</t1742> <t1743>The man's hands were tied first to each other and then to a stick of the helm.</t1743> <t1744>There was a cross between his palm and the wood, and the rosary attached to the cross was wrapped around both his wrists and the helm, all supported by strings.</t1744> <t1745>Perhaps the poor man was sitting at first, but as the sails flapped and struggled with the wind, the helm moved his body from its place, causing him to be dragged back and forth; so much so that the strings he was tied with cut into his flesh down to the bone.</t1745> <t1746>A definitive report on the incident was written, and the doctor who came immediately after me - Surgeon J.</t1746> <t1747>M.</t1747> <t1748>Caffyn from 33 East Elliot Place - stated after the examination that the man must have been dead for at least two days.</t1748> <t1749>In his pocket was a carefully corked bottle; inside it was nothing but a small roll of paper that seemed to be an addition to the logbook.</t1749> <t1750>The coast guard officer said that the man must have tied his own hands by undoing the knots with his teeth.</t1750> <t1751>The fact that the coast guard officer was the first to board the ship could prevent some difficulties that might arise in the Maritime Court in the future, because the coast guard officer cannot claim the right to salvaged goods granted to the first civilian to board a shipwreck.</t1751> <t1752>However, the legal jaws had already dropped, and a young law student loudly argued that ownership rights had already been lost, that it was held in violation of unsellable property legislation because although the helm's tiller was not proof of power of attorney, it was symbolically held in a dead hand.</t1752> <t1753>Needless to say, the dead helmsman, who kept his honorable watch until his death - showing a patience as noble as that of the young "Casabianca" - was taken from his place with great respect and brought to the morgue to await the official investigation.</t1753>
<t1754>The storm that suddenly broke out is already starting to pass and its intensity is decreasing; the crowds are dispersing to their homes and the sky is beginning to redden over the Yorkshire moors.</t1754> <t1755>For your next issue, I will send more details about the abandoned ship that miraculously found its way to the harbor during the storm.</t1755>
<t1756>Whitby</t1756>
<t1757>August 9.</t1757><t1758>- The events following the strange arrival of the abandoned ship in last night's storm are almost more frightening than the event itself.</t1758><t1759>The ship turned out to be a Russian vessel from Varna, named Demeter.</t1759><t1760>The ship is almost entirely filled with silver sand; it has very little cargo - a few large wooden crates filled with soil.</t1760><t1761>This cargo was received this morning by Mr. S., a legal advisor from Whitby, who officially took delivery of the goods sent to him.</t1761><t1762>F.</t1762><t1763>Billington, sent to number 7 Crescent.</t1763><t1764>The Russian consul also officially took delivery of the ship under the charter agreement and paid all port fees, etc.</t1764><t1765>Nothing else is being talked about here today other than this strange coincidence; the Chamber of Commerce officials were very meticulous about ensuring everything was done according to current regulations.</t1765><t1766>They are clearly determined that there should be no reason for complaints later, as people's interest will soon wane.</t1766><t1767>The dog that landed when the ship struck was a great curiosity, and more than one member of the SPCA, which is very strong in Whitby, rushed to embrace the animal.</t1767><t1768>However, the dog's disappearance caused general disappointment; it seemed to have vanished from the town entirely.</t1768><t1769>Perhaps it got scared and headed for the bushes; it might still be hiding there in fear.</t1769><t1770>There are those who look at such a possibility with fear, thinking it might be a danger in the future, as it is clearly a wild animal.</t1770><t1771>Early this morning, a large shepherd dog mix belonging to a coal merchant near Tate Hill Pier was found dead on the road opposite its owner's yard.</t1771><t1772>It had fought and clearly had a wild opponent, as its throat was torn, and its abdomen was slashed open as if attacked by a predatory claw.</t1772>
<t1773>Later.</t1773> <t1774>- Thanks to the courtesy of the Chamber of Commerce inspector, I was allowed to glance at the logbook of the Demeter, which was kept regularly until the last three days but contained no remarkable data other than the facts about the missing men.</t1774> <t1775>However, the truly interesting thing was the paper that came out of the bottle and was presented at the official inquiry today; I have never encountered a narrative stranger than what these two documents combined create.</t1775> <t1776>Since there is no reason to conceal them, I was permitted to use them; I am sending you a copy of the technical details related to shipping and cargo transport.</t1776> <t1777>It almost seems that the captain succumbed to some kind of madness before dying in the blue waters of the sea, and this condition appears to have increased throughout the voyage.</t1777> <t1778>Of course, my statement should be taken cum grano23 because, due to the short time, I am writing this as dictated by the Russian consulate clerk who kindly translated them for me.</t1778>
<t1779>Demeter's logbook</t1779>
<t1780>From Varna to Whitby</t1780>
<t1781>It was written on July 18th, such strange things are happening that I will record everything in detail until we reach the shore.</t1781>
<t1782>On July 6, we completed loading our cargo of chests filled with silver sand and soil.</t1782> <t1783>At noon, we set sail.</t1783> <t1784>The east wind, fresh.</t1784> <t1785>The crew, five deckhands, ... two deck officers, a cook, and myself (the captain).</t1785>
<t1786>At dawn on July 11, we entered the Bosphorus Strait in Istanbul.</t1786> <t1787>Turkish customs officers boarded the ship.</t1787> <t1788>Tip.</t1788> <t1789>Everything is settled.</t1789> <t1790>We set off at 4 in the evening.</t1790>
<t1791>We passed through the Dardanelles on July 12.</t1791> <t1792>More customs officers and the flagship of the security fleet.</t1792> <t1793>Again, a tip.</t1793> <t1794>The officers worked meticulously, but the job was done quickly.</t1794> <t1795>They want us to leave immediately.</t1795> <t1796>We passed through the archipelago in the dark.</t1796>
<t1797>We passed Cape Matapan on July 13th.</t1797> <t1798>The crew is discontent about something.</t1798> <t1799>They seem scared, but they are not saying it outright.</t1799>
<t1800>On July 14, I had concerns regarding the crew.</t1800> <t1801>They are all sturdy men who have sailed with me before.</t1801> <t1802>The deck officer couldn't understand what the issue was; they just told him there was something on the ship and made the sign of the cross.</t1802> <t1803>That day, the deck officer got very angry and hit someone.</t1803> <t1804>I expected a heated fight, but everything was calm.</t1804>
<t1805>On the morning of July 16, the deck officer reported that one of the crew members, Petrovski, was missing.</t1805> <t1806>He couldn't provide an explanation.</t1806> <t1807>The night before, he had taken the port watch at eight; he handed over the watch to Abramov, but did not return to his bunk.</t1807> <t1808>The men are more cheerless than ever.</t1808> <t1809>They all said they expected something like this, but they weren't saying more than that there was something on the ship.</t1809> <t1810>The deck officer is getting increasingly nervous; I fear there might be trouble ahead.</t1810>
<t1811>One day before July 17, one of the men, Olgaren, came to my cabin and explained in fear that he believed there was a stranger on the ship.</t1811> <t1812>During his watch, when he took shelter behind the wheelhouse because of a rainstorm, he saw a tall, thin man who did not resemble any of the crew members come out from the deck doorway and disappear as he walked along the deck.</t1812> <t1813>He had carefully watched the man and found no one when he reached the bow of the ship; all the hatchways were closed.</t1813> <t1814>He was seized by a fear based on superstition, and I am afraid this panic might spread.</t1814> <t1815>To quell it, I will carefully search the entire ship from top to bottom today.</t1815>
<t1816>Later in the day, I gathered the entire crew and told them that since they thought someone was on board, we would search every inch of the ship.</t1816> <t1817>The first deck officer was angry; he said it was nonsense and that giving in to such foolish thoughts would lower the men's morale, and he promised to keep them out of trouble with a stick.</t1817> <t1818>When the others started searching carefully side by side with lanterns in hand, I left the helm to the deck officer; we did not leave a single corner unsearched.</t1818> <t1819>There were no odd corners where a man could hide, just large wooden crates.</t1819> <t1820>When the search ended, the men were greatly relieved and returned to work cheerfully.</t1820> <t1821>The first deck officer frowned but said nothing.</t1821>
<t1822>July 22.</t1822> <t1823>- The weather has been stormy for the last three days and the entire crew is busy with the sails - no time to be afraid.</t1823> <t1824>The men seem to have forgotten their fears.</t1824> <t1825>The deck officer has regained his cheerfulness and everyone is getting along well with each other.</t1825> <t1826>I praised the men for their work in the bad weather.</t1826> <t1827>We passed through the Strait of Gibraltar.</t1827> <t1828>Everything is fine.</t1828>
<t1829>July 24.</t1829> <t1830>- It's as if there's a bad fate over the ship.</t1830> <t1831>We are already one crew member short, and with the bad weather, as we entered the Bay of Biscay, another man went missing - disappeared.</t1831> <t1832>Like the first one, he finished his watch and was never seen again.</t1832> <t1833>All the men are in a panic from fear; they wanted to keep watch in pairs because they are afraid to be alone.</t1833> <t1834>The deck officer got angry.</t1834> <t1835>I'm afraid there will be some trouble, because either he or the crew will resort to violence.</t1835>
<t1836>July 28.</t1836> <t1837>- Four days in a kind of vortex where we were battered and the wind turned into a storm in hell.</t1837> <t1838>No sleep for anyone.</t1838> <t1839>All the men are exhausted.</t1839> <t1840>I don't quite know how to organize the watches as no one has the strength to continue.</t1840> <t1841>The second deck officer volunteered to take the helm, keep watch, and allow the men to sleep for a few hours.</t1841> <t1842>The wind is dying down; the sea is still terrible, but we feel it less as the ship is more stable.</t1842>
<t1843>July 29.</t1843> <t1844>- Another disaster.</t1844> <t1845>Since the crew was too tired to keep watch in pairs, single watches were held tonight.</t1845> <t1846>When the morning watchman came to the deck, he saw no one around except the helmsman.</t1846> <t1847>He shouted, and everyone came to the deck.</t1847> <t1848>Everywhere was searched thoroughly, but no one was found.</t1848> <t1849>We no longer have our second deck officer, and the crew is in a panic.</t1849> <t1850>The deck officer and I have agreed to walk around armed from now on and wait for a signal.</t1850>
<t1851>July 30.</t1851> <t1852>- Last night.</t1852> <t1853>I was happy because we were approaching England.</t1853> <t1854>The weather is nice, all sails are open.</t1854> <t1855>I retreated to the cabin exhausted; I slept soundly; I was awakened by the deck officer who said that both the watchman and the helmsman were missing.</t1855> <t1856>Only the deck officer, two crew members, and I were left to navigate the ship.</t1856>
<t1857>August 1st.</t1857> <t1858>- There has been fog for two days and no ship has been seen.</t1858> <t1859>I had hoped to send a distress signal or to enter somewhere when we entered the English Channel.</t1859> <t1860>Since we do not have the strength to use the sails, we must take the wind at our back.</t1860> <t1861>We do not dare to lower the sails because we would not be able to raise them again.</t1861> <t1862>It felt like we were drifting towards a terrible end, caught in the current.</t1862> <t1863>The deck officer's morale was worse than that of the other two men.</t1863> <t1864>His strong nature seemed to be working against him internally.</t1864> <t1865>The men are worse than scared; they have prepared their minds for the worst, working insensibly and patiently.</t1865> <t1866>The men are Russian, the deck officer is Romanian.</t1866>
<t1867>2</t1867> <t1868>August, midnight.</t1868> <t1869>- I woke up from a few minutes of sleep, apparently due to a scream coming from outside my door.</t1869> <t1870>I couldn't see anything in the fog.</t1870> <t1871>I ran to the deck and encountered the deck officer.</t1871> <t1872>He said he heard the scream and ran, but there was no sign of the man on watch.</t1872> <t1873>Another one is gone.</t1873> <t1874>God help us!</t1874> <t1875>The deck officer says we must have passed the Dover Strait because the fog lifted for a moment just as he heard the man scream, and he saw the North Foreland.</t1875> <t1876>If so, it means we have now entered the North Sea, and only God can guide us in this fog that seems to move with us; yet it seems God has forsaken us.</t1876>
<t1877>August 3rd.</t1877> <t1878>- At midnight, I went to relieve the man at the helm, but when I arrived, I found no one there.</t1878> <t1879>The wind had calmed, and since we were sailing before the wind, we were not off course.</t1879> <t1880>I didn't dare leave the helm, so I called out to the deck officer.</t1880> <t1881>Within seconds, he rushed to the deck in his undershirt.</t1881> <t1882>He looked at me with wild eyes and appeared exhausted; I feared he had completely lost his mind.</t1882> <t1883>He came close to me and, as if afraid the air might hear us, he whispered hoarsely into my ear: "He's here; now I know.</t1883> <t1884>Last night, while on watch, I saw that Thing; it looked human, tall, thin, and deathly pale.</t1884> <t1885>It was standing at the bow, looking out.</t1885> <t1886>I sneaked up behind it and stabbed that Thing with my knife; but the knife passed through it as if it were air."</t1886> <t1887>And as he spoke, he drew out his knife and stabbed it fiercely into the air.</t1887> <t1888>Then he continued: "But that Thing is here, and I will find it.</t1888> <t1889>Maybe it's hiding inside one of those crates.</t1889> <t1890>I will pry the nails off each one and see.</t1890> <t1891>You hold the helm."</t1891> <t1892>He went below with a warning look and his finger to his lips.</t1892> <t1893>The wind was shifting, and I couldn't leave the helm.</t1893> <t1894>I saw him come back on deck with a tool chest and a lantern, then descend through the forward hatch.</t1894> <t1895>He's gone mad, completely deranged; there's no point in trying to stop him.</t1895> <t1896>He can't harm those big crates: they were billed as "Mud," the most harmless thing he could do is push them around.</t1896> <t1897>So, I stay here at the helm, writing this.</t1897> <t1898>I can only trust in God and wait for the fog to lift.</t1898> <t1899>Then, if I can't steer to a port with the wind, I'll cut the sails and signal for help...</t1899>
<t1900>Almost everything is now over.</t1900> <t1901>Just as I was beginning to hope that the deck officer would appear more composed - because I had heard him hitting something in the hold, and working would do him good - a blood-curdling, unexpected, and fear-filled scream came from the hatch; the deck officer shot up to the deck like a bullet - a furious madman with eyes wild and face contorted with fear.</t1901> <t1902>"Save me!</t1902> <t1903>Save me!" he shouted; he looked around at his surroundings shrouded in mist.</t1903> <t1904>His fear turned to despair, and in a calm voice, he said, "You'd better come too, captain, before it's too late.</t1904> <t1905>He's here."</t1905> <t1906>Now I know the secret.</t1906> <t1907>The sea will protect me from Him, and that's all that's left.</t1907> <t1908>Before I could say a single word or move to stop him, he dashed to the rail and deliberately threw himself into the sea.</t1908> <t1909>I think now I know the secret too.</t1909> <t1910>This madman who had gotten rid of the men one by one, and now he followed them.</t1910> <t1911>God, help me!</t1911> <t1912>How will I account for all these horrifying events when I reach the port?</t1912> <t1913>When I reach the port!</t1913> <t1914>Will such a thing even happen?</t1914>
<t1915>August 4.</t1915> <t1916>- The fog that even the sunrise cannot pierce still persists.</t1916> <t1917>I know the sun has risen because I am a sailor, for no other reason do I know.</t1917> <t1918>I did not dare to go below, I did not dare to leave the helm; so I stayed here all night and in the dimness of the night I saw that Thing - that Man!</t1918> <t1919>God forgive me, but the deck officer was right to jump off the ship.</t1919> <t1920>It is better to die like a human; no one can object to dying like a sailor in the blue waters.</t1920> <t1921>But I am the captain and I must not abandon my ship.</t1921> <t1922>But I will outwit this enemy or monster, because when my strength begins to wane, I will tie my hands to the helm and with them I will tie something that this Man - this Thing! - dares not touch; then, whether the wind be good or bad, I will preserve my soul and honor like a captain.</t1922> <t1923>I am weakening and night is falling.</t1923> <t1924>If he can fix his gaze on me once more, I may not have time to act.</t1924> <t1925>If we have an accident, perhaps this bottle may be found and those who find it may understand what happened; otherwise, well, let everyone know that I remained faithful to what was entrusted to me.</t1925> <t1926>God, the Holy Virgin, and the saints help the poor, ignorant soul trying to fulfill his duty...</t1926>
<t1927>Of course, the outcome of the matter was open to interpretation.</t1927> <t1928>There is no evidence at all; and there is no one to say whether this man committed the murders.</t1928> <t1929>Almost the entire public argues that the captain is a hero, and therefore a public funeral will be held for him.</t1929> <t1930>It has already been decided that his body will be taken to Esk with a boat convoy and then brought back to Tate Hill Pier and carried up the monastery steps; because he will be buried in the churchyard on the hillside.</t1930> <t1931>More than a hundred boat owners have already given their names, stating that they want to follow the captain to his grave.</t1931>
<t1932>There is no trace of the big dog; this is causing much sorrow because, considering the current state of public opinion, I believe the dog would have been adopted by the town.</t1932> <t1933>The funeral will be held tomorrow; thus, another "sea mystery" will come to an end.</t1933>
<t1934>Mina Murray's journal</t1934>
<t1935>August 8.</t1935> <t1936>- Lucy was very restless all night, so I couldn't sleep either.</t1936> <t1937>The storm was frightening, and the wind made a loud clattering noise in the chimney caps, causing me to startle.</t1937> <t1938>When a strong and sudden gust blew, the sound was like a gunshot in the distance.</t1938> <t1939>It's strange that Lucy didn't wake up; but she got up and dressed twice.</t1939> <t1940>Fortunately, each time I woke up in time and managed to undress her and put her back to bed without waking her.</t1940> <t1941>This sleepwalking issue is very peculiar, because as soon as her will is obstructed by any physical means, her purpose - if there is one - disappears, and she completely surrenders to the ordinary course of her life.</t1941>
<t1942>In the morning, we both got up early and went to the harbor to see if anything had happened during the night.</t1942> <t1943>There were very few people around; despite the sun being bright and the air clear and clean, the waves, which looked dark because of the foam on their crests like snow, were forcing their way through the narrow mouth of the harbor like a bully pushing through a crowd.</t1943> <t1944>For some reason, I was glad that Jonathan was on land rather than at sea last night.</t1944> <t1945>But, oh, on land or at sea?</t1945> <t1946>Where and how?</t1946> <t1947>I am worried for him in fear.</t1947> <t1948>I wish I knew what to do and could do something!</t1948>
<t1949>August 10.</t1949><t1950>- The poor captain's funeral today was very sad.</t1950><t1951>It seemed like all the boats in the harbor were there, and the coffin was carried by the captains from Tate Hill Pier all the way to the churchyard.</t1951><t1952>Lucy came with me, and we went early to our old bench and sat down as the boat procession went up the viaduct and then back down.</t1952><t1953>We had a very good view and watched the procession almost from start to finish.</t1953><t1954>The poor man was buried very close to our bench; thus, when the time came, we stood on the bench and saw everything.</t1954><t1955>Poor Lucy looked very sad.</t1955><t1956>She was constantly restless and tense; I couldn't help but think that the dreams she had at night were having a bad effect on her.</t1956><t1957>She is acting quite strangely about one thing: She doesn't admit that there is any reason for her restlessness, or if there is such a reason, she doesn't understand it herself.</t1957><t1958>There is another reason for her restlessness: Poor old Mr. Swales was found dead on our bench this morning with his neck broken.</t1958><t1959>According to the doctor, he clearly fell onto the bench out of some kind of terror, because his face had an expression of fear and horror that, according to the men, made their hair stand on end.</t1959><t1960>Poor dear old man!</t1960><t1961>Perhaps his dying eyes saw Death!</t1961><t1962>Lucy is so sweet and sensitive that she feels such effects much more strongly than other people.</t1962><t1963>Now she is very upset over a small matter that I, personally, don't care much about despite liking animals a lot.</t1963><t1964>One of the men who often comes here to look at the boats always has his dog with him.</t1964><t1965>The dog is always with him.</t1965><t1966>Both are very quiet beings; I have never seen the man get angry or the dog bark.</t1966><t1967>During the ceremony, the dog did not come to its owner, who was sitting on the bench next to us, but stood a few meters away, barking and howling.</t1967><t1968>The owner spoke to it first gently, then sternly, and finally angrily; but the dog neither came to him nor stopped making noise.</t1968><t1969>It was in some kind of rage; its eyes wild, its fur standing on end like the tail of a cat going into battle.</t1969><t1970>Eventually, the man also got angry, walked towards the dog, kicked it, and half-dragged, half-threw it onto the gravestone to which the bench was fixed.</t1970><t1971>As soon as it fell onto the stone, the poor thing went quiet and started trembling.</t1971><t1972>It didn't try to escape, it cowered and trembled in such a pitiable terror that I tried to soothe it, though it had little effect.</t1972><t1973>Lucy also felt very sorry for it, but she did not try to touch the dog, only looked at it with pained eyes.</t1973><t1974>I fear that Lucy's nature is too sensitive to go through life without trouble.</t1974><t1975>I am sure she will see this in her dreams tonight.</t1975><t1976>The combination of all these things - the ship being brought into the harbor by a dead man; the man being tied to the helm with a cross and rosary; the touching funeral ceremony; the dog in a state of furious terror - will provide material for her dreams.</t1976>
<t1977>I think the best thing will be for him to get physically tired and go to bed, so I will take him for a long walk on the slopes leading to Robin Hood's Bay and bring him back.</t1977> <t1978>Then, he won't have much desire for sleepwalking.</t1978>

<t1981>The same day, 11 PM.</t1981><t1982>- Ah! How tired I am!</t1982><t1983>If I hadn't made it a duty to keep a journal, I wouldn't open it tonight.</t1983><t1984>We had a very nice walk.</t1984><t1985>After a while, Lucy cheered up; I think we owe this to a few cute cows that slowly approached us in the field near the lighthouse and scared us.</t1985><t1986>I think we forgot everything except our personal fears, and in this way, we wiped the slate clean and made a fresh start.</t1986><t1987>At Robin Hood's Bay, we had a perfect "bitter tea" in a lovely, tiny, old-fashioned inn with a curved window right above the seaweed-covered rocks on the shore.</t1987><t1988>I'm sure our appetite would astonish the "New Woman".</t1988><t1989>Men are more tolerant, God bless them!</t1989><t1990>Then we walked home, taking a few, or rather many, rest breaks, with an unending fear of wild bulls in our hearts.</t1990><t1991>Lucy was really very tired, and we aimed to crawl into our beds as quickly as possible.</t1991><t1992>But the young preacher came to visit us, and Ms. Westenra asked him to stay for dinner.</t1992><t1993>Both Lucy and I fought the sleep fairy for him; I know it was a tough battle for me, but I acted quite heroically.</t1993><t1994>I think one day bishops should come together and find a way to produce a new class of preachers who, no matter how much they are insisted upon, do not stay for dinner and understand that the girls are tired.</t1994><t1995>Lucy fell asleep and is breathing lightly.</t1995><t1996>Her cheeks are more colorful than ever and oh, she looks so sweet.</t1996><t1997>If Mr. Holmwood fell in love with her just by seeing her in the living room, I wonder what he would say if he saw her now.</t1997><t1998>Someday, some "New Woman" writers will support the idea that men and women should be allowed to see each other while sleeping before proposing or accepting a marriage proposal.</t1998><t1999>But I think in the future, the "New Woman" will not show the humility to accept a marriage proposal; she will make the proposal herself.</t1999><t2000>And she will do a very good job at it!</t2000><t2001>We can find some consolation in this.</t2001><t2002>I am very happy tonight because Lucy looks better.</t2002><t2003>Really, I believe she has overcome the danger and the problems related to dreaming.</t2003><t2004>My happiness would be complete if I knew Jonathan was well, God bless and protect him.</t2004>
<t2005>August 11, 3 AM.</t2005><t2006>- Diary again.</t2006><t2007>Now there's no sleep, so I might as well write.</t2007><t2008>I'm too excited to sleep.</t2008><t2009>We experienced such an adventure, such a surprising experience.</t2009><t2010>As soon as I closed my diary, I fell asleep.</t2010><t2011>I suddenly woke up, sitting up with a terrifying fear pressing down on me and a sense of emptiness around me.</t2011><t2012>The room was dark, so I couldn't see Lucy's bed; I quietly went over and searched for Lucy by touch.</t2012><t2013>The bed was empty.</t2013><t2014>I lit a match and saw that she wasn't in the room.</t2014><t2015>The door was closed, but it wasn't locked as I had left it.</t2015><t2016>I was afraid of waking her mother, who had been sicker than ever lately; so I put on some clothes and prepared to look for Lucy.</t2016><t2017>As I was leaving the room, it occurred to me that what she was wearing might give some clues about her purpose in sleepwalking.</t2017><t2018>A robe meant home; a dress meant outside.</t2018><t2019>Both the robe and the dress were in their places.</t2019><t2020>"Thank God!" I said to myself; "She can't have gone far, because she's only in her nightgown."</t2020><t2021>I ran downstairs and looked in the sitting room.</t2021><t2022>She wasn't there!</t2022><t2023>Then, with a growing fear that chilled my heart, I looked in all the other rooms with open doors in the house.</t2023><t2024>Finally, I reached the entrance door and saw that it was open.</t2024><t2025>It wasn't wide open, but the latch wasn't in place.</t2025><t2026>The household is quite diligent about locking the door every night, so I feared that Lucy had gone outside just as she was.</t2026><t2027>There was no time to think about what might have happened; an overwhelming, all-encompassing fear blurred all the details.</t2027><t2028>I grabbed a large, heavy shawl and ran outside.</t2028><t2029>When I reached the Crescent, the clock struck one, and there wasn't a single person in sight.</t2029><t2030>I ran along North Terrace, but there was no sign of the white figure I was expecting.</t2030><t2031>With hope or fear - I don't know which - of seeing Lucy on our favorite bench, I looked from the edge of North Cliff over the harbor to East Cliff on the other side.</t2031><t2032>There was a bright full moon and heavy, dark, moving clouds that turned the entire landscape into a visual feast of light and shadow as they drifted.</t2032><t2033>For a second or two, I couldn't see anything because a cloud's shadow darkened Saint Mary's Church and its surroundings.</t2033><t2034>Then, as the cloud passed, I saw the ruins of the Abbey reappear; a narrow line of light, as sharp as a sword cut, moved forward, and the church and churchyard began to come into view.</t2034><t2035>Whatever my expectation was, it wasn't in vain, because there, on our favorite bench, the moon's silver light was shining on a snow-white figure leaning back slightly.</t2035><t2036>The cloud quickly returned before I could see much more; the shadow almost immediately cut off the light, but it seemed to me that there was something dark standing behind the bench where the white figure had shone.</t2036><t2037>I couldn't tell what it was, whether human or animal; I didn't wait to look again; I ran down the steep steps leading to the pier and ran across the bridge, the only way to reach East Cliff from the fish market.</t2037><t2038>The town was dead, as I didn't see a single person; I was glad of this because I didn't want anyone to witness Lucy's condition.</t2038><t2039>Time and distance seemed infinite; my knees trembled, and I began to breathe heavily as I struggled up the endless stairs leading to the Abbey.</t2039><t2040>I must have gone quickly, but I felt as if lead weights were tied to my feet and all the joints in my body were rusted.</t2040><t2041>As I approached the top, I began to see the bench and the white figure, for I was now close enough to distinguish it despite the shadow's effect.</t2041><t2042>Undoubtedly, there was a long, black thing bending over the half-reclining white figure.</t2042><t2043>In horror, I shouted, "Lucy! Lucy!" and something lifted its head; from where I stood, I could see a white face with red, gleaming eyes.</t2043><t2044>Lucy didn't respond, and I ran to the entrance of the churchyard.</t2044><t2045>When I entered, the church was between me and the bench, and I lost sight of Lucy for about a minute.</t2045><t2046>When I began to see her again, the cloud had passed, and the moonlight was so bright that I could see Lucy lying slightly reclined with her head on the back of the bench.</t2046><t2047>She was completely alone, and there was no sign of any living thing around her.</t2047>
<t2048>When I leaned over, I could see that she was still asleep.</t2048> <t2049>Her lips were parted and she was breathing - not softly as usual, but with long, deep breaths as if she wanted to fill her lungs completely with each inhale.</t2049> <t2050>When I approached her, she raised her hand in her sleep and wrapped the collar of her nightgown around her neck.</t2050> <t2051>As she did this, she shivered slightly as if she felt the cold.</t2051> <t2052>I threw a warm shawl over her and fastened the edges tightly around her neck because I was afraid she might catch a bad chill in the night air while she was so exposed.</t2052> <t2053>I was afraid of waking her suddenly, so I secured the shawl around her neck with a large safety pin to free my hands and help her; but in my anxious clumsiness, I must have pricked or stuck her with the pin because soon after, as her breathing calmed, she brought her hand to her neck and groaned once more.</t2053> <t2054>Once I had carefully wrapped her up, I put my shoes on her feet and then began to wake her gently.</t2054> <t2055>At first, she did not respond, but she became increasingly restless, occasionally groaning and sighing in her sleep.</t2055> <t2056>Time was passing quickly, and for many other reasons, I wanted to get her home as soon as possible; finally, I shook her with great effort until she opened her eyes and woke up.</t2056> <t2057>Of course, she did not seem surprised to see me because she did not immediately understand where she was.</t2057> <t2058>Lucy always wakes up beautifully, and even at such a time, when her body was chilled from the cold and her mind was somewhat horrified by waking up in the churchyard at night without her clothes, she did not lose her grace.</t2058> <t2059>She shivered a little and hugged me; when I told her to come home with me immediately, she stood up without saying a word, like an obedient child.</t2059> <t2060>As we walked, the gravel hurt my feet, and Lucy noticed the pained expression on my face.</t2060> <t2061>She stopped and wanted to insist that I take my shoes back, but I refused.</t2061> <t2062>But when we reached the goat path outside the churchyard, where there was a puddle left from the storm, I stepped into the mud with one foot after the other, so that if we encountered anyone on the way home, no one would notice my bare feet.</t2062>
<t2063>Luck was on our side and we reached home without encountering anyone.</t2063> <t2064>Once, as we were moving along the road ahead, we saw a man who was not very sober; but we hid in the recess of a doorway until the man disappeared down one of the steep paths called wynds in Scotland.</t2064> <t2065>My heart was beating so fast that I thought I would faint at times.</t2065> <t2066>I was very worried about Lucy; not only for her health, fearing she might be harmed by being exposed, but also for her reputation if the story were to spread from ear to ear.</t2066> <t2067>After we went inside, washed our feet, and said a prayer of thanks together, I put her to bed.</t2067> <t2068>Before falling asleep, she asked me not to tell anyone, not even her mother, about this sleepwalking adventure, she even begged for it.</t2068> <t2069>At first, I hesitated to promise this; but when I thought about her mother's health and how learning about this would worry her, and how such a story could be distorted if it leaked out -no, it would definitely be distorted- I decided it was wiser to do as she asked.</t2069> <t2070>I hope I did the right thing.</t2070> <t2071>I locked the door; the key is tied to my hand so that perhaps I won't be disturbed again.</t2071> <t2072>Lucy is sleeping soundly; the reflection of dawn can be seen over the sea...</t2072>
<t2073>Same day, noon.</t2073> <t2074>- Everything is fine.</t2074> <t2075>Lucy slept until I woke her up and she doesn't seem to have turned in her bed.</t2075> <t2076>The night's adventure doesn't seem to have harmed her; on the contrary, it seems to have benefited her, because this morning she looks better than she has in weeks.</t2076> <t2077>I'm sorry that my clumsiness with the safety pin hurt her.</t2077> <t2078>Indeed, the situation could have been serious because the skin on her neck is slightly pierced.</t2078> <t2079>I must have pierced a loose piece of skin because there are two small red dots on her neck like pinholes and a drop of blood on the collar band of her nightgown.</t2079> <t2080>When I apologized and said I was worried about it, she laughed, patted me, and said she didn't feel anything.</t2080> <t2081>Fortunately, since it is very tiny, it won't leave a mark.</t2081>
<t2082>Same day, night.</t2082> <t2083>- We had a happy day.</t2083> <t2084>The weather was clear, the sun was shining, and there was a cool breeze.</t2084> <t2085>We took our lunch to Mulgrave Woods, Ms. Westenra went by road in the carriage, and Lucy and I walked along the cliff path and met her at the gate.</t2085> <t2086>I was a bit sad because I couldn't help but feel how completely happy I would be if Jonathan were with me.</t2086> <t2087>But there it is! I must be patient.</t2087> <t2088>In the evening, we strolled on the Casino Terrace, listened to beautiful music by Spohr and Mackenzie, and went to bed early.</t2088> <t2089>Lucy seems more peaceful than she has been for some time, she fell asleep immediately.</t2089> <t2090>Even though I don't expect any trouble tonight, I will lock the door and secure the key as before.</t2090>
<t2091>August 12.</t2091> <t2092>- My expectations were wrong because I woke up twice during the night with Lucy trying to go outside.</t2092> <t2093>Even in her sleep, she seemed a bit impatient to find the door closed and returned to bed with a protesting attitude.</t2093> <t2094>I woke up at dawn and heard the chirping of birds in front of the window.</t2094> <t2095>Lucy also woke up, and I was glad to see that she was even better than the previous morning.</t2095> <t2096>Her old cheerful demeanor seemed to have completely returned; she came and curled up next to me and told me everything about Arthur; I told her how worried I was about Jonathan, and then she tried to comfort me.</t2096> <t2097>Well, she somehow managed to do so, because although empathy cannot change the facts, it can help make them more bearable.</t2097>
<t2098>August 13th.</t2098> <t2099>- Another calm day and, as on previous nights, I went to bed with the key tied to my hand.</t2099> <t2100>Once again, I woke up during the night and found Lucy sitting on the bed still asleep, pointing towards the window.</t2100> <t2101>I quietly got up and drew the curtain to look outside.</t2101> <t2102>There was a bright moonlight, and the soft effect of the light on the sea and sky - the two blending into each other in a great, silent mystery - was indescribably beautiful.</t2102> <t2103>A large bat was flying in wide circles between the moonlight and me.</t2103> <t2104>Once or twice it came quite close, but I think it got scared when it saw me, and flew away towards the Monastery, passing over the harbor.</t2104> <t2105>When I turned back from the window, Lucy had lain down again and was sleeping peacefully.</t2105> <t2106>She did not move at all for the rest of the night.</t2106>
<t2107>August 14.</t2107> <t2108>- I spent the whole day reading and writing at East Cliff.</t2108> <t2109>Lucy seems to love this place as much as I do, and it's hard to get her to leave and go home for lunch, tea, or dinner.</t2109> <t2110>She said something strange this afternoon.</t2110> <t2111>We were heading home for dinner and had reached the top of the stairs that start at the West Pier, and as usual, we stopped to look at the view.</t2111> <t2112>The sun, which had sunk quite low in the sky, was almost setting behind Kettleness; its red light was spread over East Cliff and the Abbey, making everything seem bathed in a beautiful pink glow.</t2112> <t2113>We stood in silence for a while, and suddenly Lucy murmured, as if talking to herself:</t2113>
<t2114>“Those red eyes again!”</t2114> <t2115>“Just like those eyes.”</t2115> <t2116>It was such a strange, unrelated remark that it quite frightened me.</t2116> <t2117>I turned a bit to get a better look at Lucy without seeming to stare at her and saw that she was in a semi-dazed state with a strange, incomprehensible expression on her face; so I said nothing, but watched her eyes.</t2117> <t2118>She seemed to be looking at the bench where a shadow sat alone.</t2118> <t2119>I was a bit frightened, because for a moment it seemed as if the stranger had large, blazing eyes; but when I looked again, the optical illusion was gone.</t2119> <t2120>The red sunlight was shining on the windows of Saint Mary’s Church behind our bench, and as the sun set, the light refracted and reflected in such a way that it seemed as if the light had moved.</t2120> <t2121>I drew Lucy’s attention to this unusual effect; she started and came to herself, but she looked unhappy; she might have been thinking about the terrible night here.</t2121> <t2122>We never mention that night; so I said nothing and we returned home for dinner.</t2122> <t2123>Lucy had a headache and went to bed early.</t2123> <t2124>Seeing that she was asleep, I went out for a short walk; I walked along the slopes to the west; a sweet melancholy filled me because I was thinking of Jonathan.</t2124> <t2125>On my way back home -the moonlight was bright; so bright that although the part of the Crescent on our side was in shadow, everything could be seen very clearly- I glanced at our window and saw Lucy’s head leaning out.</t2125> <t2126>I thought she might be looking for me, so I opened my handkerchief and waved it.</t2126> <t2127>She didn’t notice or make any movement.</t2127> <t2128>At that moment, the moonlight slid from the corner of the building and fell on the window.</t2128> <t2129>There was Lucy, clearly, with her head resting on the window sill and her eyes closed.</t2129> <t2130>She was in a deep sleep, and beside her, on the window ledge, sat something that looked like a large bird.</t2130> <t2131>Fearing she might catch cold, I ran upstairs, but when I entered the room, she was still asleep and breathing deeply as she returned to her bed; she had brought her hand to her throat as if to protect it from the cold.</t2131> <t2132>I didn’t wake her, but I covered her well; I made sure the door was locked and the window was tightly closed.</t2132>
<t2133>He looks so sweet while sleeping; but he looks paler than usual and there is a tired and weary shadow under his eyes that I don't quite like.</t2133> <t2134>I'm afraid there is something troubling him.</t2134> <t2135>I wish I could find out what it is.</t2135>
<t2136>August 15.</t2136> <t2137>- I woke up later than usual.</t2137> <t2138>Lucy was sluggish and tired, and she continued to sleep even after we were called downstairs.</t2138> <t2139>There was a happy surprise waiting for us at breakfast.</t2139> <t2140>Arthur's father is better and wants the wedding to take place as soon as possible.</t2140> <t2141>Lucy was filled with quiet joy; her mother looked both pleased and sad at the same time.</t2141> <t2142>She told me the reason later in the day.</t2142> <t2143>She is sad because she will lose her dear Lucy, but happy that she will soon have someone to protect her.</t2143> <t2144>Poor sweet woman!</t2144> <t2145>She told me she had received her death warrant.</t2145> <t2146>She hasn't told Lucy and made me promise to keep it a secret; her doctor said that due to her weak heart, she would die within a few months at most.</t2146> <t2147>At any moment, even now, a sudden shock would certainly kill the mother.</t2147> <t2148>Oh, we were wise to keep that terrible night of Lucy's sleepwalking from her.</t2148>
<t2149>August 17.</t2149> <t2150>- I haven't written in my journal for exactly two days.</t2150> <t2151>I didn't have the heart to write.</t2151> <t2152>It's as if a dark veil has been cast over our happiness.</t2152> <t2153>No news from Jonathan, and as her mother's final hours draw near, Lucy is growing weaker.</t2153> <t2154>I can't understand why Lucy is fading away like this.</t2154> <t2155>She eats well, sleeps well, and enjoys the fresh air, but the roses in her cheeks keep fading and she grows weaker and more lethargic each day; at night, I can almost hear her struggling to breathe.</t2155> <t2156>I always keep the key to our door tied to my wrist at night, but she gets up and walks around the room and sits by the open window.</t2156> <t2157>Last night, when I woke up, I found her hanging out of the window, and when I tried to wake her, I couldn't; she was in a trance.</t2157> <t2158>When I finally managed to bring her around, she was as weak as water and silently cried between her long, painful struggles to breathe.</t2158> <t2159>When I asked her how she got to the window, she shook her head and turned away.</t2159> <t2160>I hope her feeling ill isn't because of that unfortunate pin prick.</t2160> <t2161>Now, while she was sleeping, I looked at her throat and the tiny wounds still don't seem to be healing.</t2161> <t2162>They are still open and, on the contrary, they appear to be wider and the edges slightly whitened.</t2162> <t2163>The centers are red with small white spots.</t2163> <t2164>If they don't heal in a day or two, I will insist that the doctor looks at them.</t2164>

<t2194>Mina Murray's journal</t2194>
<t2195>August 18.</t2195> <t2196>- Today I am happy and writing while sitting on a bench in the church garden.</t2196> <t2197>Lucy is much better.</t2197> <t2198>Last night, she slept well all night and did not disturb me even once.</t2198> <t2199>Although she still looks distressingly pale and exhausted, it is as if the roses have returned to her cheeks.</t2199> <t2200>If she had anemia, I could understand it, but she does not.</t2200> <t2201>Her spirits are high, full of life and joy.</t2201> <t2202>She seems to have moved away from all that frightening silence and, as if I needed reminding, she reminded me of that night and how I found her here, sleeping on this very bench.</t2202> <t2203>As she was telling me these things, she was joyfully tapping the stone slab on the ground with the heel of her boot:</t2203>
<t2204>“Then my poor little feet didn't make much noise!</t2204> <t2205>I think if poor old Mr. Swales were here, he would tell me it was because I didn't want to wake Geordie.”</t2205> <t2206>Since he was so talkative, I asked him if he had any dreams that night.</t2206> <t2207>Before answering, that sweet, wrinkled expression that Arthur - I call him Arthur too, as is Lucy's habit - said he loved came over his face; indeed, I am not surprised that Arthur says so.</t2207> <t2208>Then, as if trying to remind himself, he continued his words in a half-dazed manner:</t2208>
<t2209>“I didn't dream much; but everything felt real.</t2209> <t2210>I just wanted to be here, at this point - I don't know why, but I was afraid of something - I don't know what it was.</t2210> <t2211>I think I was sleeping, but I remember passing through the streets and over the bridge.</t2211> <t2212>As I was passing, a fish jumped, I bent down to look at it, and as I was climbing the stairs, I heard a lot of dogs barking - it was as if the whole town was full of dogs barking in unison.</t2212> <t2213>Then, vaguely, I remember something both very sweet and very bitter surrounding me, along with a long and dark figure with red eyes, just like we saw at sunset; then it felt like I was diving into deep green waters and a song was playing in my ears, just like the ones I heard in the ears of drowning people; then everything seemed to move away from me; it was as if my soul had left my body and was flying in the air.</t2213> <t2214>At one point, I remember the West Lighthouse being right below me, then a painful feeling came over me as if I was caught in an earthquake, and I came back, I saw you shaking my body.</t2214> <t2215>I saw you doing it before I felt you.</t2215><t2216>”</t2216>
<t2217>Then she started laughing.</t2217> <t2218>What she told me seemed a bit eerie and I listened to her without taking a breath.</t2218> <t2219>I didn't quite like what she was saying and thought it would be better to steer her mind away from this topic; thus, we shifted to other subjects and Lucy returned to her old self.</t2219> <t2220>When we got home, the fresh breeze invigorated her, and her once pale cheeks were now truly pinker.</t2220> <t2221>Her mother was very happy to see her and we had a very pleasant evening together.</t2221>
<t2222>August 19.</t2222> <t2223>- Joy! Joy! Joy! Even if not everything is joyful.</t2223> <t2224>Finally, there is news from Jonathan.</t2224> <t2225>My poor darling was sick; that's why he didn't write.</t2225> <t2226>Now that I know what happened, I'm not afraid to think or say it.</t2226> <t2227>Mr. Hawkins sent me the letter, and he also wrote himself, oh, how thoughtful.</t2227> <t2228>I will leave here in the morning to go to Jonathan, and if necessary, help with his treatment and bring him home.</t2228> <t2229>Mr. Hawkins says it wouldn't be a bad thing to get married there.</t2229> <t2230>When I read the kind-hearted Sister's letter, I cried so much that I am now holding it to my chest and feeling its wetness.</t2230> <t2231>The letter is from Jonathan and it should stay close to my heart because Jonathan is in my heart.</t2231> <t2232>The details of my journey have been planned and my suitcase is packed.</t2232> <t2233>I am only taking one dress besides what I am wearing; Lucy will bring my luggage to London and keep it there until I ask for it, because...</t2233> <t2234>I should not write more; I should save these for Jonathan, my husband.</t2234> <t2235>The letter he saw and touched should comfort me until I meet him.</t2235>

<t2239>August 12</t2239>
<t2240>Dear Madam,</t2240>
<t2241>Thanks be to God, Saint Joseph, and Mother Mary, I am writing on behalf of Mr. Jonathan Harker, whose condition is improving but who does not yet have the strength to write himself.</t2241> <t2242>He has been under our care for about six weeks, suffering from severe brain fever.</t2242> <t2243>He wishes me to convey his love and, while writing to Mr. Peter Hawkins in Exeter on his behalf, to extend his deepest respects, apologize for the delay, and inform that all his tasks are completed.</t2243> <t2244>He needs to rest for a few weeks in our sanatorium in the mountains, but he will return afterward.</t2244> <t2245>He desires me to say that he does not have enough money with him and wishes to pay for the days he has spent here so that others in need of help are not deprived.</t2245>

<t2248>Note: I am opening the letter while I am still asleep to let you know one more thing.</t2248> <t2249>He told me everything about you and said that you would soon be his wife.</t2249> <t2250>I extend my best wishes to both of you!</t2250> <t2251>He experienced a horrifying shock - our doctor says so -; the things he raved about while he was not himself were hair-raising; wolves, poison, and blood; ghouls and evil spirits and many other terrifying things that I fear to name.</t2251> <t2252>Always be careful to prevent such things from exciting him in the future; the traces of illnesses like his do not easily disappear.</t2252> <t2253>We should have written to you long ago, but we had no knowledge of his friends and found nothing on him that anyone could understand.</t2253> <t2254>He arrived here by train from Klausenberg, and according to what the station master told the conductor, he had run into the station and shouted that he wanted a ticket home.</t2254> <t2255>Realizing from his harsh behavior that he was English, they gave him a ticket to the farthest station reached by the train on this route.</t2255>
<t2256>Make sure she is well taken care of.</t2256> <t2257>She won all hearts with her sweetness and kindness.</t2257> <t2258>She is genuinely getting better, and I have no doubt that she will fully recover in a few weeks.</t2258> <t2259>But for your safety, keep an eye on her.</t2259> <t2260>I pray to God, Saint Joseph, and Mother Mary that you have many long and happy years ahead.</t2260>
<t2261>Dr. Seward's journal</t2261>
<t2262>August 19.</t2262> <t2263>- Last night, there was a strange and sudden change in Renfield.</t2263> <t2264>Around eight o'clock, he began to get excited and sniff around like a dog.</t2264> <t2265>The attendant, who was affected by his behavior and knew of my interest in him, encouraged Renfield to talk.</t2265> <t2266>Renfield is generally respectful to the attendant and sometimes even fawns over him, but the man said he was very arrogant tonight.</t2266> <t2267>He did not deign to speak in any manner.</t2267> <t2268>The only thing he said was:</t2268>
<t2269>“I don't want to talk to you: You are not important right now; My master is about to arrive.</t2269><t2270>”</t2270>
<t2271>The nurse thinks that the patient has been influenced by a sudden onset of some kind of religious frenzy.</t2271> <t2272>If so, we should be cautious of the uproar that will ensue, because a strong person who is inclined to kill and has fallen into religious madness can suddenly become dangerous.</t2272> <t2273>I visited him personally at nine o'clock.</t2273> <t2274>His attitude towards me was the same as the one he had towards the nurse; in his exalted state of mind, the difference between me and the nurse was nothing.</t2274> <t2275>The situation appears to be a religious-themed madness, soon he will think that he is God.</t2275> <t2276>This small difference between two people is extremely insignificant for an Omnipotent being.</t2276> <t2277>How these madmen reveal themselves!</t2277> <t2278>The true God cares about the fall of a sparrow; but the God created from human pride cannot see the difference between an eagle and a sparrow.</t2278>
<t2279>For half an hour or more, Renfield's excitement gradually increased.</t2279> <t2280>I pretended not to be watching him, but I still observed him closely.</t2280> <t2281>Suddenly, that cunning look we see in the eyes of madmen when an idea strikes them, and the sly movement of the head and back well known to the attendants in the asylum, appeared.</t2281> <t2282>The patient became very quiet, went and sat meekly at the edge of his bed, staring blankly into space.</t2282> <t2283>I thought I could discern whether his indifference was genuine or feigned, so I tried to steer the conversation towards his pets, a topic that never failed to capture his interest.</t2283> <t2284>At first, he did not respond, but finally, he said in a contrary manner:</t2284>
<t2285>“What do I care about them!</t2285> <t2286>They don't matter to me at all!</t2286><t2287>”</t2287>
<t2288>“No!” I said.</t2288> <t2289>“You don't mean to say you're not interested in spiders.” (His current hobby is spiders, and his notebook is filled with columns of small numbers.</t2289><t2290>)</t2290> <t2291>He gave a mysterious answer to this:</t2291>
<t2292>“Bridesmaids please the eyes that await the bride's arrival; but when the bride approaches, the bridesmaids do not shine in those eyes.</t2292><t2293>”</t2293>
<t2294>He did not explain what he meant, but throughout the time I stayed with him, he sat tirelessly on his bed.</t2294>
<t2295>Tonight I am weary and unhappy.</t2295> <t2296>I could do nothing but think of Lucy and how different everything could be.</t2296> <t2297>If I don't sleep immediately, then chloral, the modern Morpheos25 - C2Cl3CH(OH)2!</t2297> <t2298>I must be careful not to let this become a habit.</t2298> <t2299>No, I will not take it tonight! I thought of Lucy and I should not mix this with thoughts of her, it would be disrespectful to Lucy.</t2299> <t2300>If necessary, I will spend this night sleepless...</t2300>
<t2301>I am pleased that I made this decision, and even more pleased that I adhered to it.</t2301> <t2302>I lay tossing and turning; when the guard sent from the ward came to tell me that Renfield had escaped, I had only heard the clock strike twice.</t2302> <t2303>I quickly put on my clothes and ran downstairs; my patient is a man too dangerous to be wandering around.</t2303> <t2304>His thoughts can lead to dangerous outcomes for others.</t2304> <t2305>When I arrived, the nurse was waiting for me.</t2305> <t2306>He said it had not even been ten minutes since he looked through the observation hole in the door and saw him seemingly asleep in his bed.</t2306> <t2307>The sound of the window being opened outward caught his attention.</t2307> <t2308>He turned back and ran to the door, and upon seeing the patient's foot disappear out the window, he immediately called for me.</t2308> <t2309>The patient is only in his nightclothes and cannot have gone far.</t2309> <t2310>The nurse thought it would be more useful to watch where he was going rather than chase after him and risk losing his trail as he exited the building through the door.</t2310> <t2311>The nurse is a burly man and couldn't get out the window.</t2311> <t2312>I am slender, and with the nurse's help, I went out the window feet first and landed on the ground without injury, as we were only a few meters up.</t2312> <t2313>The nurse said the patient turned left and went straight ahead, so I ran as fast as I could.</t2313> <t2314>As I passed through the trees, I saw a white figure climbing the high wall that separates our grounds from the abandoned house's property.</t2314>
<t2315>I ran back immediately and told the guard to quickly gather three or four men and follow me to the Carfax estate in case our friend was dangerous.</t2315> <t2316>I took a ladder and climbed over the wall to the other side.</t2316> <t2317>I could see Renfield's silhouette disappearing around the corner of the house, so I ran after him.</t2317> <t2318>I found him leaning against the iron-framed oak door of the chapel at the far end of the house.</t2318> <t2319>He was clearly talking to someone, but I was afraid to get close enough to hear what he was saying for fear of scaring him away.</t2319> <t2320>Chasing a swarm of stray bees is nothing compared to watching a naked madman in the throes of an escape fit!</t2320> <t2321>But after a few minutes, I realized he wasn't paying attention to anything around him, so I dared to approach him - my courage bolstered by the fact that my men had climbed over the wall and were approaching him as well.</t2321> <t2322>I heard him say: "I am here to carry out your orders, Master.</t2322> <t2323>I am your slave and you will reward me, for I will be faithful to you.</t2323> <t2324>I have worshipped you for a long time, even when you were far away.</t2324> <t2325>Now that you are near, I await your commands; you won't overlook me when distributing the good things, will you, dear Master?</t2325><t2326>"</t2326>
<t2327>Still, he was an old, selfish beggar.</t2327> <t2328>Even when he believed he was in the presence of Absolute Power, he was thinking about bread and fish.</t2328> <t2329>The coming together of their madness creates a surprising mixture.</t2329> <t2330>He fought like a tiger when we surrounded him.</t2330> <t2331>He was very strong and resembled a wild animal more than a human.</t2331> <t2332>I had never seen a madman having such a fit of rage before; I hope I never see one again.</t2332> <t2333>It is a great blessing that we understood the extent of his power and the danger he posed.</t2333> <t2334>With the strength and determination he showed, he could have done wild things before being caged.</t2334> <t2335>Anyway, he is safe now.</t2335> <t2336>Even Jack Sheppard26 couldn't escape from the straitjacket that restrained him; he was chained to the wall in a padded room.</t2336> <t2337>His screams are sometimes terrifying, but the silences that follow are even more frightening, because with every turn and every movement, he is plotting death.</t2337>
<t2338>He just spoke sensibly for the first time:</t2338>
<t2339>“I will be patient, Sir.</t2339> <t2340>It's coming - it's coming - it's coming!” I deciphered the implied meaning of this indirect statement and came here.</t2340> <t2341>I was too excited to sleep, but this journal calmed me down and I feel like I will get some sleep tonight.</t2341>

<t2343>From Mina Harker</t2343>
<t2344>Letter to Lucy Westenra</t2344>
<t2345>Budapest, August 24</t2345>
<t2346>Dearest Lucy,</t2346>
<t2347>I know you'll be curious to learn everything that has happened since we parted at the train station in Whitby.</t2347><t2348>Well, my dear, I arrived safely in Hull, caught the ship to Hamburg, and from there, the train that brought me here.</t2348><t2349>I can't remember much about the journey except that I knew I needed to sleep as much as possible since I would need to take care of Jonathan when I arrived.</t2349><t2350>I found my beloved looking so weak, pale, and frail!</t2350><t2351>My dear, all the determination in his eyes, that quiet dignity I told you about on his face, had vanished.</t2351><t2352>He has become a shadow of himself and does not remember what happened to him during that long period.</t2352><t2353>At least, he wants me to believe that, and I will never ask.</t2353><t2354>He has suffered a terrible shock, and I fear that trying to remember it might strain his poor brain too much.</t2354><t2355>Sister Agatha, who is a very good soul and a natural nurse, says that he raved about horrible things when he was acting mad.</t2355><t2356>I asked her to tell me what they were, but she just crossed herself and said she would never tell; because a patient's ravings are considered God's secrets, and if a nun hears them as part of her duty, she must respect the trust placed in her.</t2356><t2357>She is sweet and kind; the next day, when she saw I was distressed, she brought up the subject again and said she could never speak of what my beloved raved about, but added: "I can tell you this much, dear: What he raved about was not something bad he had done, and there is no reason for you to worry as his future wife.</t2357><t2358>He has not forgotten you or what he owes you.</t2358><t2359>His fear is related to things so great and terrifying that no mortal could speak of them."</t2359><t2360>I think this sweet person thought I might be jealous if my poor beloved had fallen in love with another girl.</t2360><t2361>Imagine thinking I could be jealous of Jonathan!</t2361><t2362>But still, my dear, let me whisper that I felt a joyful relief when I learned that another woman was not the cause of his distress.</t2362><t2363>Now, I am sitting by his bed, where I can see his face while he sleeps.</t2363><t2364>He is waking up!..</t2364><t2365>When he woke up, he wanted his coat to get something from his pocket; I told Sister Agatha, and she brought all of Jonathan's belongings.</t2365><t2366>Among his things, I saw his notebook, and knowing that I might find a clue to his trouble inside, I was about to ask for permission to look at it when I think he saw my desire in my eyes; because he asked me to go to the window for a moment, saying he wanted to be alone.</t2366><t2367>Then he called me back, and when I returned, his hand was on the notebook, and with a very serious expression, he said: "Wilhelmina," - that was when I knew he was very serious because he hadn't called me by that name since he proposed - "My dear, you know my thoughts on trust between husband and wife: There should never be any secrets or mysteries between them.</t2367><t2368>I have experienced a great shock, and when I try to think about what it was, I feel as if my head is spinning; I don't know if these things are entirely real or just the dreams of a madman.</t2368><t2369>You know I had brain fever, and that means madness.</t2369><t2370>The secret is here, and I don't want to know what it is.</t2370><t2371>I want to continue my life here, by marrying you."</t2371><t2372>Because, my dear, we had decided to marry as soon as the formalities were completed.</t2372><t2373>"Wilhelmina, are you willing to share my ignorance?</t2373><t2374>Here is the notebook.</t2374><t2375>Take it and keep it, read it if you want, but never let me know; unless a serious duty compels me to revisit those painful hours recorded here, whether asleep or awake, sane or mad."</t2375><t2376>He leaned back in exhaustion, placed the notebook under his pillow, and I kissed him.</t2376><t2377>I asked Sister Agatha to plead with the higher authorities to allow our marriage to take place today, and now I am waiting for the answer...</t2377>
<t2378>The nun came back and said that the English missionary church pastor had been called.</t2378> <t2379>We will get married within an hour or as soon as Jonathan wakes up...</t2379>
<t2380>Lucy, the moment came and went.</t2380> <t2381>I feel very honored and very, very happy.</t2381> <t2382>Jonathan woke up about an hour after our last conversation; everything was ready, and Jonathan was sitting up in bed, propped up by pillows.</t2382> <t2383>"I accept," he said clearly and strongly.</t2383> <t2384>I could barely speak; my heart was so full that even those words seemed to choke me.</t2384> <t2385>The dear nuns were very considerate.</t2385> <t2386>Please, God, never ever let me forget them or the heavy and sweet responsibilities I have taken on.</t2386> <t2387>I must tell you about my wedding gift.</t2387> <t2388>When the priest and the nuns left my husband and me -Oh, Lucy, this is the first time I write the word "husband"- when they left my husband and me alone, I took the notebook out from under his pillow, wrapped it in white paper, tied it with a light blue ribbon that I wore around my neck, sealed it with wax, and used my wedding ring as the seal.</t2388> <t2389>Then I kissed the package and showed it to my husband, telling him that I would keep the notebook this way, so it would be a visible and clear sign that we trust each other throughout our lives, and that I would never open it unless it was for his own good or an unrelenting duty.</t2389> <t2390>Then he took my hand, and oh, Lucy, it was the first time he held his wife's hand, and he said it was the most beautiful thing in the world and that he would relive the entire past to earn it, if necessary.</t2390> <t2391>My poor darling meant a part of the past, but he can't think about time yet, and I wouldn't be surprised if he mixes up not only months but also years.</t2391>
<t2392>Yes, my love, what could I have said?</t2392> <t2393>I told him only that I was the happiest woman in the world and that I had nothing to give but myself, my life, and my trust, and that these would be accompanied by the love and respect I would feel for him every day of my life.</t2393> <t2394>And my love, when he kissed me and pulled me towards him with his poor, weak hands, it felt as if there was a sacred vow between us.</t2394>
<t2395>Lucy, my dear, do you know why I am telling you all this?</t2395> <t2396>Not only because I enjoyed these things, but also because you are very important to me.</t2396> <t2397>It was a privilege for me to be your friend and guide when you left the classroom to prepare for life.</t2397> <t2398>Now, I want you to see with the eyes of a very happy spouse where this duty has brought me; so that you can be as happy in your married life as I am.</t2398> <t2399>My dear, I pray to the Almighty God that your life will be as promised: a long, sunny day where harsh winds do not blow, duties are not forgotten, and there is no insecurity.</t2399> <t2400>I should not wish for it to be painless, because that can never be; but I hope you will always be as happy as I am now.</t2400> <t2401>Goodbye, my dear.</t2401> <t2402>I will send this to the post immediately and perhaps write to you again very soon.</t2402> <t2403>I must finish my letter because Jonathan is waking up - I need to take care of my husband!</t2403>
<t2404>Will always love you</t2404>

<t2406>From Lucy Westenra</t2406>
<t2407>Letter to Mina Harker</t2407>
<t2408>Whitby, August 30</t2408>
<t2409>Dearest Mina,</t2409>
<t2410>Oceans of love and millions of kisses; I hope you will soon be in your own home with your husband.</t2410><t2411>I also hope you return early enough to stay with us here for a while.</t2411><t2412>This harsh weather will quickly restore Jonathan's health; it has brought me back to myself quite a bit.</t2412><t2413>My appetite is like that of a wild animal, I am full of life and sleeping well.</t2413><t2414>You will be glad to know that I have quite stopped sleepwalking.</t2414><t2415>I don't think I've moved from my bed for a week, I mean after getting into bed at night.</t2415><t2416>Arthur says I am starting to gain weight.</t2416><t2417>By the way, I forgot to tell you that Arthur is here.</t2417><t2418>We are having such wonderful walks, carriage rides, horse riding, boat trips, playing tennis, and fishing together!</t2418><t2419>I love him more than ever.</t2419><t2420>He tells me that he loves me more, but I doubt it because he had said from the very beginning that it was impossible for him to love me more than he did at that moment.</t2420><t2421>But that's nonsense.</t2421><t2422>Look, he is calling me.</t2422><t2423>So that's all for now.</t2423>
<t2424>The one who loves you</t2424>
<t2425>LUCY</t2425>
<t2426>Note: My mother sends her love.</t2426> <t2427>The poor thing looks better.</t2427>
<t2428>Note: We will get married on September 28th.</t2428>
<t2429>Dr. Seward's journal</t2429>
<t2430>August 20.</t2430> <t2431>- The Renfield case is becoming more and more interesting.</t2431> <t2432>He has now become so quiet that there are moments of calm between his bouts of madness.</t2432> <t2433>During the first week after his seizure, he constantly exhibited violent tendencies.</t2433> <t2434>Then one night, just as the moon was rising, he calmed down and began to mutter to himself: "I can wait now; I can wait now."</t2434> <t2435>The nurse came to tell me this, and I immediately rushed downstairs to check on Renfield.</t2435> <t2436>He was still in the padded room with his straitjacket on, but the expression we had seen on his face for so long was gone, and the old pleading - almost "fawning" - soft look had returned to his eyes.</t2436> <t2437>I was pleased with his current state and ordered the straitjacket to be removed.</t2437> <t2438>The nurses hesitated, but eventually complied with my wishes without objection.</t2438> <t2439>It was strange that the patient had enough sense of humor to notice their distrust; because he came up to me and, looking at them slyly, whispered:</t2439>
<t2440>“They think I can harm you!</t2440> <t2441>Imagine if I thought I could harm you!</t2441> <t2442>Fools!”</t2442>
<t2443>Even in the mind of this poor madman, being kept separate from the others was somehow a soothing feeling; but still, I did not understand his thinking.</t2443> <t2444>Should I think that we have something in common and that we should stick together because of it, or is my well-being necessary for him because he will gain a great benefit from me?</t2444> <t2445>I must understand this later.</t2445> <t2446>He will not speak tonight.</t2446> <t2447>Even the suggestion of a kitten or an adult cat will not tempt him.</t2447> <t2448>The only thing he said was: "I am not interested in cats.</t2448> <t2449>I have other things to think about now and I can wait; I can wait.</t2449><t2450>"</t2450>
<t2451>After a while, I left his side.</t2451> <t2452>The nurse says that Renfield remained quiet until dawn, then started to become restless, and eventually had a violent seizure that exhausted him to the point of fainting.</t2452>
<t2453>...</t2453> <t2454>For three nights the same thing happened - violent during the day and then, from moonrise to sunrise, silent.</t2454> <t2455>I wish I could find a clue as to why.</t2455> <t2456>It was as if he was under the influence of something that came and went intermittently.</t2456> <t2457>What a good thought!</t2457> <t2458>Tonight we will play the sane against the mad.</t2458> <t2459>He escaped without our help before; tonight he will escape with our help.</t2459> <t2460>We will give him a chance and keep men ready to follow him if necessary...</t2460>
<t2461>August 23.</t2461> <t2462>- "The unexpected always happens."</t2462> <t2463>Disraeli knew life so well.</t2463> <t2464>Our bird did not fly when it found the cage open, thus all our clever arrangements went to waste.</t2464> <t2465>Still, we proved one thing: Periods of silence last quite long.</t2465> <t2466>In the future, we can loosen its bonds for a few hours each day.</t2466> <t2467>I instructed the night attendant to confine it to the padded room only when it quiets down until an hour before dawn.</t2467> <t2468>Although the poor thing's mind may not appreciate the value of this, its body will enjoy the relaxation.</t2468> <t2469>Wait! The unexpected happened again!</t2469> <t2470>They are calling me; the patient has escaped once more.</t2470>
<t2471>Later.</t2471> <t2472>- Another night adventure! Renfield skillfully waited for the nurse to enter the room for inspection.</t2472> <t2473>Then he quickly passed him and dashed out, flying down the corridor.</t2473> <t2474>I told the nurses to go after him.</t2474> <t2475>He went to the grounds of the abandoned house again, and we found him pressed against the door of the old chapel in the same place.</t2475> <t2476>He got very angry when he saw me; if the nurses hadn't caught him in time, he might have tried to kill me.</t2476> <t2477>Something strange happened while the men were holding him.</t2477> <t2478>Suddenly, he made twice the effort to escape from our grasp and then immediately calmed down.</t2478> <t2479>Instinctively, I looked around, but I saw nothing.</t2479> <t2480>Then I caught the patient's gaze and focused on where he was looking; in the great silence, I found nothing but the sky illuminated by the moonlight, with a large bat flapping its wings like a ghost towards the west.</t2480> <t2481>Bats usually fly in circles, but this one seemed to be going straight as if it knew where it was going and had a specific purpose.</t2481> <t2482>The patient calmed down more with each passing second and finally said:</t2482>
<t2483>"You don't need to tie me up; I'll go quietly!" We returned home without any trouble.</t2483> <t2484>I feel that there is something unsettling in his calmness, and I will never forget this night.</t2484>
<t2485>Lucy Westenra's diary</t2485>
<t2486>Hillingham, 24 August.</t2486> <t2487>- I should emulate Mina and write down what has happened.</t2487> <t2488>That way, we can talk at length when we meet.</t2488> <t2489>I wonder when we will meet.</t2489> <t2490>I wish she were by my side again, because I feel very unhappy.</t2490> <t2491>I think I had a dream again last night, just like in Whitby.</t2491> <t2492>Maybe it's because of the change in weather or because we have returned home again.</t2492> <t2493>Everything is very dark and frightening for me, because I can't remember anything, but I am gripped by an inexplicable fear; I feel very weak and exhausted.</t2493> <t2494>Arthur was quite upset when he saw me at lunch, but I had no strength to try to cheer up.</t2494> <t2495>I wonder if I can sleep in my mother's room tonight?</t2495> <t2496>I must come up with an excuse and try to sleep in my mother's room.</t2496>
<t2497>August 25.</t2497> <t2498>- Another bad night.</t2498> <t2499>My mother seemed unwilling to accept my offer.</t2499> <t2500>She doesn't look very well herself and undoubtedly fears worrying me.</t2500> <t2501>I tried to stay awake and managed to do so for a while; when the clock struck twelve, it woke me from my sleep, so I must have fallen asleep.</t2501> <t2502>There was a kind of scratching or flapping sound at the window, but I didn't pay any attention to it; I don't remember anything else, I think I must have fallen asleep at that moment.</t2502> <t2503>Nightmares again.</t2503> <t2504>I wish I could remember them.</t2504> <t2505>This morning, I am terribly weak.</t2505> <t2506>My face is deathly pale and my throat hurts.</t2506> <t2507>There must be something wrong with my lungs because it feels like I'm not getting enough air.</t2507> <t2508>I'll try to cheer up when Arthur arrives, otherwise, I know he'll be devastated to see me like this.</t2508>

<t2511>Albemarle Hotel, August 31</t2511>
<t2512>Dear Jack,</t2512>
<t2513>I want you to do me a favor.</t2513> <t2514>Lucy is ill; that is, she doesn't have a specific illness, but she looks terrible and is getting worse every day.</t2514> <t2515>I asked her if there was a reason for this; I don't dare ask her mother because worrying the poor lady about her daughter could be fatal given her current condition.</t2515> <t2516>Ms. Westenra told me that poor Lucy doesn't know yet, but her end is near due to heart disease.</t2516> <t2517>I'm sure there's something eating away at my beloved.</t2517> <t2518>I go crazy thinking about her; it pains me to look at her.</t2518> <t2519>I told her I would ask you to see her; although she initially resisted - I know why, my old friend - she eventually agreed.</t2519> <t2520>I know it will be a bothersome task for you, my old friend, but it's for her own good, and neither of us should hesitate to do this.</t2520> <t2521>Tomorrow, to avoid arousing Ms. Westenra's suspicion, you will have lunch at Hillingham at two o'clock, and after lunch, Lucy will have the opportunity to be alone with you.</t2521> <t2522>I will come for tea, and we can leave together; I am very worried and want to talk to you alone as soon as possible after you see her.</t2522> <t2523>Please don't neglect this!</t2523>

<t2533>Arthur Holmwood's letter</t2533>
<t2534>2</t2534> <t2535>September</t2535>
<t2536>Dear old friend,</t2536>
<t2537>I can quickly tell you about Miss Westenra's health that, in my opinion, there is no functional disorder or any disease that I know of.</t2537> <t2538>However, I was not at all pleased with her appearance; she looks distressingly changed compared to the last time I saw her.</t2538> <t2539>Of course, you must take into account that I did not have the opportunity for a thorough examination as I would have liked; our friendship creates a difficulty that neither medical science nor traditions can overcome.</t2539> <t2540>The best thing is for me to tell you exactly what happened so that you can come to your own conclusions to some extent.</t2540> <t2541>Then I will tell you what I did and what I suggest should be done.</t2541>
<t2542>I found Miss Westenra seemingly cheerful.</t2542> <t2543>Her mother was there, and after a few seconds, I concluded that she was doing everything to deceive her mother and prevent her from worrying.</t2543> <t2544>Although she wasn't sure what it was, I have no doubt that she sensed precautions needed to be taken.</t2544> <t2545>We had lunch alone, and while we all strove to cheer up, our efforts were somewhat rewarded, and a bit of genuine joy emerged among us.</t2545> <t2546>Then Miss Westenra went to lie down, and Lucy stayed with me.</t2546> <t2547>We went to Lucy's room; her cheerfulness lasted until we entered the room because the servants were coming and going.</t2547> <t2548>But as soon as the door closed, the mask on her face fell, and with a deep sigh, she collapsed into a chair and covered her eyes with her hands.</t2548> <t2549>Seeing her mood change, I immediately took the opportunity to diagnose her reaction.</t2549> <t2550>With great kindness, she said:</t2550>
<t2551>“I can't tell you how much I hate talking about myself."</t2551> <t2552>I reminded her that doctor-patient confidentiality is sacred, but that you were becoming increasingly worried about her with each passing day.</t2552> <t2553>She immediately understood what I meant and summarized the matter in a single word: “Tell Arthur whatever you want.</t2553> <t2554>I'm not thinking about myself, only him!”</t2554> <t2555>That's why I'm quite free.</t2555>
<t2556>I could easily see that she was somewhat anemic, but there were no usual signs of anemia; by chance, I was able to measure the quality of her blood because a wire snapped while opening a stuck window and she slightly cut her hand with the broken glass.</t2556><t2557>In itself, it was a trivial thing, but it gave me a clear opportunity, and I took a few drops of blood and examined them.</t2557><t2558>The qualitative examination yielded quite normal results, and according to this conclusion, her health seems quite good.</t2558><t2559>I was convinced that there was no need to worry about other physical matters; but since there must be a cause for this problem somewhere, I concluded that it must be mental.</t2559><t2560>She complained that from time to time she had difficulty getting enough breath and that she had heavy, deep sleeps filled with dreams that frightened her, but she remembered nothing afterward.</t2560><t2561>She says she had a habit of sleepwalking as a child, that this habit reappeared while she was in Whitby, and one night she went out in her sleep to East Cliff and Miss Murray found her there; but she emphasizes that this old habit has not recurred recently.</t2561><t2562>I am skeptical of this and did the best thing that came to my mind; I wrote to my old friend and mentor, Professor Van Helsing of Amsterdam, who knows more about obscure diseases than anyone else in the world.</t2562><t2563>I asked him to come here, and since you said you would cover everything, I told him who you are and what your connection is with Miss Westenra.</t2563><t2564>I did this in accordance with your wishes, my dear friend, because I would take great pride and happiness in doing anything for Miss Westenra.</t2564><t2565>For a personal reason, I know that Van Helsing would do anything for me.</t2565><t2566>Therefore, whatever reason he comes here for, we must accept his wishes.</t2566><t2567>He may seem like someone who does whatever he pleases, but this is because he knows what he is talking about better than anyone else.</t2567><t2568>He is a philosopher, a metaphysician, one of the best scientists of his time, and I believe he is entirely open-minded.</t2568><t2569>Besides these, his iron nerves, nature resembling a river of ice, unyielding determination, self-control, and tolerance, his extremely fine and honest heart - these are the tools of his noble work for humanity - all these work both in theory and practice, because his views are as broad as his all-encompassing love.</t2569><t2570>I am telling you these facts so that you can understand why I trust him so much.</t2570><t2571>I wanted him to come here immediately.</t2571><t2572>I will see Miss Westenra again tomorrow.</t2572><t2573>She will meet me at Harrod's so as not to alarm her mother by repeating my visit so early.</t2573>

<t2581>2</t2581> <t2582>September</t2582>
<t2583>Dear Friend,</t2583>
<t2584>When I received your letter, I was already preparing to come to you.</t2584><t2585>By chance, I can set off immediately without wronging any of the people who trust me.</t2585><t2586>If luck had been otherwise, it would have been bad for the people who trust me because, my friend, I go when someone who values certain people asks for my help.</t2586><t2587>Tell your friend that when you quickly sucked the gangrene poison from my wound, which was transferred from that scalpel slipped by our other overly nervous friend, you did more for me than you need my help now, and if luck favors them, you did more than I could ever do for them.</t2587><t2588>But for him, for your friend, doing something is an added happiness for me; I am coming for you.</t2588><t2589>Then arrange rooms for me at the Great Eastern Hotel, so I will be nearby, and please arrange for me to see the young lady before it gets too late tomorrow, because I may need to return here that night.</t2589>
<t2590>But if necessary, I will come again within three days and stay longer if required.</t2590> <t2591>Until that day, farewell, my dear friend John.</t2591>

<t2593>Respectfully from Dr. Seward</t2593>
<t2594>Arthur Holmwood's letter</t2594>
<t2595>September 3</t2595>
<t2596>Dear Art,</t2596>
<t2597>Van Helsing came and went.</t2597> <t2598>He came with me to Hillingham, and thanks to Lucy’s cleverness, we saw that her mother was out for lunch so that we could be alone with her.</t2598> <t2599>Van Helsing examined the patient very carefully.</t2599> <t2600>He will inform me, and I will tell you, because of course, I was not always with them.</t2600> <t2601>I fear Van Helsing is very worried, but he believes he needs to think.</t2601> <t2602>When I told him about our friendship and how you trust me on this matter, he said: “You should tell her everything you think.</t2602> <t2603>If you can guess, you can also tell her what I think, if you wish.</t2603> <t2604>No, I am not joking.</t2604> <t2605>This is not a joke; it is a matter of life and death, perhaps even more.”</t2605> <t2606>I asked him what he meant by that because he was very serious.</t2606> <t2607>This conversation happened when we returned to town, while Van Helsing was having a cup of tea before setting off for Amsterdam.</t2607> <t2608>He gave me no other clues.</t2608> <t2609>You must not be angry with him, Art, because his silence means his mind is working for Miss Westenra’s well-being.</t2609> <t2610>Undoubtedly, he will speak clearly enough when the time comes.</t2610> <t2611>So I told him I would write an account of our visit as if I were writing a special descriptive article for the Daily Telegraph.</t2611> <t2612>He seemed not to notice, but he remarked that the fog in London was not as bad as it was during his student years here.</t2612> <t2613>If he can prepare it, I will get his report tomorrow.</t2613> <t2614>In any case, I will get a letter from him.</t2614>
<t2615>Yes, regarding the visit: Lucy was more cheerful compared to the first day I saw her and definitely looked better.</t2615> <t2616>The pallor that had unsettled you had somewhat faded, and her breathing had returned to normal.</t2616> <t2617>She behaved very sweetly towards the Professor (as always) and tried to make him feel comfortable; though, I could see that the poor girl was making a great effort for it.</t2617> <t2618>I think Van Helsing saw it too, because I noticed that sharp look I knew from the past under his bushy eyebrows.</t2618> <t2619>Then, she started talking about all sorts of topics other than ourselves and illnesses, and she did it with such great cheerfulness that Lucy's feigned liveliness disappeared and turned into reality.</t2619> <t2620>Then, without changing her demeanor at all, she gently brought up the topic of his visit and sweetly said:</t2620>
<t2621>“Dear young lady, I am very pleased that you are so loved.</t2621> <t2622>Even if there are things I haven't seen, my dear, this is an important matter.</t2622> <t2623>They told me that you were feeling unwell and looking pale as a ghost.</t2623> <t2624>I say to them, ‘Pshaw!’"</t2624> <t2625>Then she snapped her fingers at me and continued: “But you and I will show them how wrong they are.</t2625> <t2626>He," and she pointed at me with the look and gesture she used after a particular incident she never failed to remind me of, “what could he know about young ladies?</t2626> <t2627>They have fools to play with and bring them back to happiness and love them again.</t2627> <t2628>There is much work to do and oh, great rewards of happiness to be found.</t2628> <t2629>But young ladies!</t2629> <t2630>He has neither wife nor daughter, and young people confide in the elderly like me, who know many sorrows and their causes, not in the young.</t2630> <t2631>So, my dear, we will send him to the garden to smoke, and meanwhile, you and I will have a little chat alone.”</t2631> <t2632>I took the hint and wandered around; soon the Professor came to the window and called me inside.</t2632> <t2633>He looked serious and said: “I have examined very carefully, but there is no functional cause.</t2633> <t2634>I agree with you that there has been a great loss of blood; the blood loss happened a long time ago, it is not recent.</t2634> <t2635>However, her condition has nothing to do with anemia under any circumstances.</t2635> <t2636>To make sure I haven't missed anything, I asked her to send her servant to me to answer a few questions.</t2636> <t2637>I know well what the servant will say.</t2637> <t2638>Yet there is a reason; there is always a reason for everything.</t2638> <t2639>I must go home and think.</t2639> <t2640>You must send me a telegram every day; if necessary, I will come again.</t2640> <t2641>The illness -for not being well is an illness- interests me, and the dear sweet young lady interests me too.</t2641> <t2642>She has fascinated me, and I would come for her sake, if not for yours or the illness.</t2642><t2643>”</t2643>
<t2644>As I told you, he didn't say another single word even when we were alone.</t2644> <t2645>So, Art, now you know everything I know.</t2645> <t2646>I will observe the situation carefully.</t2646> <t2647>I believe your poor father has pulled himself together.</t2647> <t2648>It must be a terrible thing for you, my dear old friend, to be caught between two people who are so valuable to you.</t2648> <t2649>I know your sense of duty to your father, and you are right to stick to it; but if necessary, I will send word for you to come to Lucy as soon as possible; so, don't worry too much unless you hear from me.</t2649>
<t2650>Dr. Seward's journal</t2650>
<t2651>September 4th.</t2651> <t2652>- The zoophagous patient still holds our interest.</t2652> <t2653>He only had one outburst, and that was at an unusual hour yesterday.</t2653> <t2654>He started getting restless just before noon.</t2654> <t2655>The nurse recognized the symptoms and immediately called for help.</t2655> <t2656>Fortunately, the men came running and arrived just in time, because as the clock struck noon, the patient became so aggressive that they had to use all their strength to restrain him.</t2656> <t2657>But within about five minutes, he quieted down and eventually sank into a sort of melancholy that is still ongoing.</t2657> <t2658>The nurse says the screams he let out during the seizure were truly horrifying; when I went in, I found I had a lot of work to do, attending to some of the other patients he had frightened.</t2658>
<t2659>Honestly, I can very well understand the impact it created, because the sounds, even though I was far away, were bothering me too.</t2659> <t2660>Dinner time at the mental hospital had passed, and my patient was now sitting in a corner with a dull, sullen, troubled expression that only pointed out things instead of saying anything directly.</t2660> <t2661>I can't quite make sense of it.</t2661>
<t2662>Later.</t2662> <t2663>- There has been a new change in my patient.</t2663> <t2664>I went to see him at five o'clock and found him happy and content as before.</t2664> <t2665>He was catching flies and eating them, and he was keeping a record of his captures by making notches with his fingernail on the protrusions of the door frame.</t2665> <t2666>When he saw me, he came up to me and apologized for his bad behavior, and with great respect and obsequiousness, he asked to be taken back to his room and to be allowed to have his notebook back.</t2666> <t2667>I thought it would be good to humor him; so, he returned to his room and his window is open.</t2667> <t2668>He spread the sugar from his tea on the window sill and is having a good harvest of flies.</t2668> <t2669>He is no longer eating them, but is putting them in a box as before, and has already started looking in the corners of his room for spiders.</t2669> <t2670>I tried to get him to talk about the last few days, because any clue about his thoughts would be of great help to me; but he did not join me in this conversation.</t2670> <t2671>For a second or two, he looked very sad and, in a tone as if he were talking to himself rather than to me, he said:</t2671>
<t2672>“Everything is over!</t2672> <t2673>Everything is over!</t2673> <t2674>She left me.</t2674> <t2675>If I don't do it myself, there is no hope left for me!”</t2675> <t2676>Then suddenly, turning to me decisively, she said: “Doctor, would you do me a great favor and allow me to have a bit more sugar?</t2676> <t2677>I think it will do me good.</t2677><t2678>”</t2678>
<t2679>“Even for the flies?” I said.</t2679>
<t2680>“Yes! Flies love it, and I love flies; therefore, I love sugar.”</t2680> <t2681>There are people ignorant enough to think that madmen cannot reason.</t2681> <t2682>I had him bring twice as much sugar as now, and I think I left him as the happiest man in the world.</t2682> <t2683>I wish I could delve into the depths of his mind.</t2683>
<t2684>Midnight.</t2684> <t2685>- Another change in the patient.</t2685> <t2686>I had just returned to the hospital after visiting Miss Westenra, whom I found much better, and was standing at our door looking at the sunset when I heard Renfield shouting once again.</t2686> <t2687>Since his room is on this side of the building, I could hear him better than in the morning.</t2687> <t2688>Turning from the perfect, misty sunset over London, with its red lights, dark shadows, and all those extraordinary hues coming over the ugly clouds and even uglier waters, to the cold, stony rigidity of my building, breathing in the richness of suffering and my lonely heart that would endure it all, shook me.</t2688> <t2689>As the sun set, I reached the patient and saw the red orb setting from his window.</t2689> <t2690>At the moment the sun set, the patient's madness gradually decreased, and as it completely set, the patient slid to the ground like a heavy lump from the hands holding him.</t2690> <t2691>But the mental healing power that mental patients possess is extraordinary, for within a few minutes, he stood up with great calmness and looked around.</t2691> <t2692>I signaled the attendants not to hold him, as I was curious to see what he would do.</t2692> <t2693>He went directly to the window and swept the sugar crumbs outside; then he took the fly box in his hand, emptied it outside, and threw the box away; then he closed the window, crossed to the other side of the room, and sat on his bed.</t2693> <t2694>All this surprised me, so I asked him, "Won't you keep flies anymore?"</t2694>
<t2695>“No,” he said; “I’m tired of this nonsense!”</t2695> <t2696>Definitely an extraordinarily interesting case.</t2696> <t2697>I wish I could take a look at his mind or the reason for his sudden madness.</t2697> <t2698>Wait; still, if we can find out why his fits occur exactly at noon and sunset today, we might get a clue.</t2698> <t2699>Could it be that the sun has a harmful effect on some dispositions - just as the moon affects others from time to time?</t2699> <t2700>We shall see.</t2700>

<t2717>Letter from Dr. Seward to the Honorable Arthur Holmwood</t2717>
<t2718>September 6</t2718>
<t2719>Dear Art,</t2719>
<t2720>My news today is not very good.</t2720> <t2721>This morning, Lucy's condition deteriorated a bit.</t2721> <t2722>But this situation had a good outcome: naturally, Ms. Westenra was worried about Lucy and consulted me about her in a professional context.</t2722> <t2723>Taking advantage of this opportunity, I told her that my old master, the great master Van Helsing, would be coming to stay with me and that we would take joint responsibility for Lucy; thus, we can come and go without unnecessarily alarming her because a sudden shock could mean her death, and in Lucy's weak condition, such a development could be disastrous for her.</t2723> <t2724>We are all surrounded by difficulties, my poor old friend; but with God's permission, we will overcome them.</t2724> <t2725>I will write if necessary, that is, if you don't hear from me, just understand that I am waiting for news.</t2725>
<t2726>With my love</t2726>

<t2728>Dr. Seward's journal</t2728>
<t2729>September 7 - The first thing Van Helsing said to me when we met on Liverpool Street was this:</t2729>
<t2730>“Did you say anything to our young friend, that is, the lady's lover?</t2730><t2731>”</t2731>
<t2732>“No,” I said.</t2732> <t2733>“As I mentioned in my telegram, I waited until I saw you.</t2733> <t2734>I wrote him a letter saying that you would come because Miss Westenra is not very well and that I would inform him if necessary.</t2734><t2735>”</t2735>
<t2736>“True, my friend,” he said, “very true!</t2736> <t2737>It is better that he does not know yet; perhaps he should never know.</t2737> <t2738>I hope it will be so; but if necessary, he must learn everything.</t2738> <t2739>And my good friend John, let me warn you.</t2739> <t2740>You are dealing with madmen.</t2740> <t2741>Everyone is mad in one way or another; be as sensible when dealing with God's madmen - the rest of the world - as you are with your own madmen.</t2741> <t2742>You do not tell your madmen what you are doing to them or why you are doing it; you do not tell them what you are thinking.</t2742> <t2743>So, leave knowledge where it can rest comfortably, gather its kind around it, and propagate.</t2743> <t2744>You and I will keep what we know here and here for now.”</t2744> <t2745>He touched first my chest and forehead and then his own in the same manner.</t2745> <t2746>“I have thoughts that I am keeping to myself right now.</t2746> <t2747>I will explain to you later.</t2747><t2748>”</t2748>
<t2749>“Why not now?” I asked.</t2749> <t2750>“It might work; we could come to a decision.”</t2750> <t2751>He paused and looked at me, then said:</t2751>
<t2752>“My friend John, when corn is growing, even before it matures - while Mother Nature's milk is still inside and the sun has not yet begun to paint it golden, the farmer pulls the cob and takes it in his rough hands, blows off the green husk, and says to you: ‘Look! This is good corn; it will yield a good harvest when the time comes.’”</t2752> <t2753>I didn't understand what he was trying to say and told him so.</t2753> <t2754>In response, just as he did in lessons long ago, he reached out and grabbed my ear, tugging it playfully as he said: “A good farmer tells you this because he knows, but until then he does not know.</t2754> <t2755>But you don't see a good farmer pulling the corn out of the ground to see if it is growing; that is for children playing at farming, not for those who see it as their life's work.</t2755> <t2756>Do you understand now, my friend John?</t2756> <t2757>I have planted my corn and there are things Nature must do for it to sprout; if it sprouts, there is hope; I will wait until the cob grows.”</t2757> <t2758>He suddenly stopped because he saw that I understood.</t2758> <t2759>Then he continued his words and said with great seriousness:</t2759>
<t2760>“You were always a very diligent student, and your casebook was always fuller than the others.</t2760> <t2761>Back then, you were just a student; now you are a master, and I believe your good habit has not diminished.</t2761> <t2762>Remember, my friend, that knowledge is stronger than memory, and we should not rely on the weaker one.</t2762> <t2763>Even if you have not maintained this good practice, let me tell you, this case concerning our dear young lady might interest us and others so much - mind you, I say might.</t2763> <t2764>So, take good notes.</t2764> <t2765>Nothing is too small.</t2765> <t2766>I advise you; record even your doubts and conjectures.</t2766> <t2767>Later, you might be interested to see how accurate your conjectures were.</t2767> <t2768>We learn from our failures, not our successes!</t2768><t2769>”</t2769>
<t2770>When I described the symptoms in Lucy -the same as before but much more pronounced- he looked very serious, but said nothing.</t2770> <t2771>He took a bag with him, containing many tools and medicines, which he referred to in one of his lectures as "the dreadful paraphernalia of our beneficial profession," the equipment of a professor in the field of treatment.</t2771> <t2772>When we were admitted inside, we were greeted by Mrs. Westenra.</t2772> <t2773>She was frightened, but not as much as I had expected to find her.</t2773> <t2774>Nature, in one of its good moods, had decreed that even the horrors caused by death should have their remedy.</t2774> <t2775>Here, in a case where a sudden shock could be fatal, things were arranged in such a way that impersonal matters -even the terrifying change in the daughter she was so attached to- seemed not to affect her.</t2775> <t2776>It was like Mother Nature covering the surroundings of a foreign mass with a kind of insensitive tissue to protect from harm upon touch.</t2776> <t2777>If this was a form of situationally arranged selfishness, then we must pause before accusing anyone of the immorality of egoism, for its reasons may have deeper roots than we know.</t2777>
<t2778>I used my knowledge regarding this stage of the mental illness and established the rule that, except in absolutely necessary situations, Lucy should not be around or think about the illness.</t2778> <t2779>She accepted this wholeheartedly, so wholeheartedly that once again I saw the hand of Nature fighting for life before me.</t2779> <t2780>Van Helsing and I were taken to Lucy's room.</t2780> <t2781>If I was surprised when I saw her yesterday, I can say that I was horrified when I saw her today.</t2781> <t2782>She was as pale as death, white as chalk; the red had drained even from her lips and gums, and her facial bones were prominently protruding; it was painful to see or hear her breathing.</t2782> <t2783>Van Helsing's face hardened like marble and his eyebrows drew so close together they almost touched above his nose.</t2783> <t2784>Lucy lay motionless and seemed to lack the strength to speak, so we all remained silent for a while.</t2784> <t2785>Then Van Helsing beckoned me over with a nod, and we slowly left the room together.</t2785> <t2786>As soon as we closed the door, we quickly moved down the corridor and passed through the open door next to it.</t2786> <t2787>Then he quickly pulled me inside and closed the door.</t2787> <t2788>"My God!" he said; "This is terrible.</t2788> <t2789>There is no time to lose.</t2789> <t2790>She will die from the lack of blood her heart needs to keep beating.</t2790> <t2791>A blood transfusion must be done immediately.</t2791> <t2792>You or me?</t2792><t2793>"</t2793>
<t2794>"I am younger and stronger, Professor.</t2794> <t2795>It should be me.</t2795><t2796>"</t2796>
<t2797>“Then get ready immediately.</t2797> <t2798>I will bring my bag.</t2798> <t2799>I am prepared.</t2799><t2800>”</t2800>
<t2801>I went down with him and as we were leaving, the entrance door was knocked.</t2801> <t2802>When we reached the hall, the servant had just opened the door and Arthur was hurriedly coming in.</t2802> <t2803>He ran towards me and said in an impatient whisper:</t2803>
<t2804>“Jack, I was very worried.</t2804> <t2805>I read between the lines of your letter and have been in great pain ever since.</t2805> <t2806>My father was better, so I rushed here to see with my own eyes.</t2806> <t2807>This gentleman, is he Dr. Van Helsing?</t2807> <t2808>I am grateful to you for coming, sir.”</t2808> <t2809>The professor looked at Arthur, annoyed at being disturbed at such a time; but now, as he examined the large build of the man before him and recognized the powerful young masculinity that seemed to emanate from him, his eyes sparkled.</t2809> <t2810>As he extended his hand, he said solemnly without hesitation:</t2810>
<t2811>“Sir, you have arrived just in time.</t2811> <t2812>You are the beloved of our dear young lady.</t2812> <t2813>Her condition is bad, very very bad.</t2813> <t2814>No, my child, do not let yourself go like this.”</t2814> <t2815>Because suddenly Arthur turned pale and sat down on a chair as if he were about to faint.</t2815> <t2816>“You will help her.</t2816> <t2817>For her, you can do more than anyone alive, and your courage is your greatest ally.</t2817><t2818>”</t2818>
<t2819>Arthur asked in a low voice, "What can I do?"</t2819> <t2820>"Tell me, I'll do it.</t2820> <t2821>My life belongs to him, and I would give the last drop of blood in my body for him." The Professor had a strong sense of humor, and in his response, I could sense traces of his origins from my past experiences:</t2821>
<t2822>“Young gentleman, I don't want that much - not the last drop!</t2822><t2823>”</t2823>
<t2824>“What should I do?”</t2824> <t2825>His eyes were blazing and his flared nostrils quivered with determination.</t2825> <t2826>Van Helsing patted him on the shoulder.</t2826> <t2827>“Come!” he said.</t2827> <t2828>“You are a man, and what we need is a man.</t2828> <t2829>You are better than me, better than my friend John.” Arthur was stunned, and the Professor continued his words with a gentle explanation:</t2829>
<t2830>“The young lady's condition is bad, very bad.</t2830> <t2831>She needs blood and must receive it, otherwise she will die.</t2831> <t2832>My friend John and I have consulted, and we are about to perform a blood transfusion, which means transferring blood from full veins to her empty veins that crave it.</t2832> <t2833>Since John is younger and stronger than me, he was going to give his blood,” -Arthur held my hand here and squeezed it tightly in silence- “but now that you are here, whether young or old, you are much better than us who are tired from working in the world of thought.</t2833> <t2834>Our nerves are not as calm as yours and our blood is not as bright as yours!” Arthur turned to him and said: “If you knew how happily I would die for her, you would understand that...</t2834><t2835>”</t2835>
<t2836>Her voice halted with a kind of obstruction.</t2836>
<t2837>Van Helsing said, "Well done, my boy!"</t2837> <t2838>"In the not too distant future, you will be happy for having done everything for the woman you love.</t2838> <t2839>Now come and be silent.</t2839> <t2840>Before the procedure is carried out, kiss her, but then you must leave; you must depart at my signal.</t2840> <t2841>Do not tell the great lady anything; you know how she is!</t2841> <t2842>She must not experience shock; any information on this matter would be a shock.</t2842> <t2843>Come!</t2843><t2844>"</t2844>
<t2845>We all went up to Lucy's room together.</t2845> <t2846>Upon receiving his orders, Arthur stayed outside.</t2846> <t2847>Lucy turned her head and looked at us, but she didn't say anything.</t2847> <t2848>She wasn't sleeping, but she was too weak to make an effort to speak.</t2848> <t2849>Her eyes spoke to us; that was all.</t2849> <t2850>Van Helsing took some things out of his bag and arranged them on a small table out of sight.</t2850> <t2851>Then he prepared a sedative and, coming to the head of the bed, cheerfully said:</t2851>
<t2852>"Now, little lady, here is your medicine.</t2852> <t2853>Be a good child and take it.</t2853> <t2854>Look, I'm lifting it up so you can swallow it easily.</t2854> <t2855>Yes." Lucy made an effort and succeeded.</t2855>
<t2856>It surprised me greatly to see how long it took for the medicine to take effect.</t2856> <t2857>This actually showed the extent of its weakness.</t2857> <t2858>The time until sleep began to flutter in his eyelids felt infinite.</t2858> <t2859>But finally, the narcotic began to take effect, and he fell into a deep sleep.</t2859> <t2860>Once the professor was satisfied, he called Arthur into the room and told him to take off his jacket.</t2860> <t2861>Then he added: "You can take that little kiss while I bring the table."</t2861> <t2862>"John, my friend, help me!" Thus, while Arthur leaned over Lucy, neither of us looked.</t2862>
<t2863>Van Helsing turned to me and said:</t2863>
<t2864>“He is so young and strong, and his blood is so pure that we do not need to dilute it.</t2864><t2865>”</t2865>
<t2866>Then Van Helsing quickly, but with absolute order, performed the procedure.</t2866><t2867>As the blood transfusion continued, something resembling life seemed to return to poor Lucy's cheeks, and despite his increasing pallor, Arthur's face definitely appeared to glow with joy.</t2867><t2868>After a while, I began to worry, because even though he was a strong man, the blood loss was badly affecting Arthur.</t2868><t2869>This gave me an idea of the terrible strain Lucy's body was under; so much so that what weakened Arthur had partially healed Lucy.</t2869><t2870>But the Professor's expression was stern, and with a watch in his hand, his eyes kept locking alternately on the patient and on Arthur.</t2870><t2871>I could hear my own heartbeat.</t2871><t2872>A little later, Van Helsing said in a soft tone: "Don't move for a second.</t2872><t2873>Enough.</t2873><t2874>You accompany him, I will look after my little lady."</t2874><t2875>When everything was over, I could see how weak Arthur had become.</t2875><t2876>I bandaged the wound, and as I took his arm to lead him away, Van Helsing spoke without turning around - as if the man had eyes in the back of his head:</t2876>
<t2877>“I think a brave lover deserves another kiss that he should receive immediately.”</t2877> <t2878>And now, having completed the procedure, he adjusted the pillow under the patient's head.</t2878> <t2879>As he did this, the narrow, black velvet band that Lucy always seemed to wear around her neck, fastened with a diamond brooch given by her lover, slid up a bit and revealed the red mark on her neck.</t2879> <t2880>Arthur did not notice this, but I could hear Van Helsing's deep sigh, one of his ways of revealing his emotions.</t2880> <t2881>He did not say anything for now, but turned to me and spoke: “Now take our brave, young lover downstairs, give him some port wine, and let him rest a bit.</t2881> <t2882>Then he should go home and rest, sleep a lot, and eat well so that he can recover what he has given to his love and heal.</t2882> <t2883>He should not stay here.</t2883> <t2884>Wait! One minute.</t2884> <t2885>I can see you have concerns about the outcome, sir.</t2885> <t2886>So, leave here knowing that the procedure was successful.</t2886> <t2887>This time you have saved her life, and you can go home and rest with a peaceful mind, knowing that everything that could be done has been done.</t2887> <t2888>When she recovers, I will tell her everything; she will love you even more for what you have done.</t2888> <t2889>Goodbye.</t2889><t2890>”</t2890>
<t2891>When Arthur left, I returned to the room.</t2891> <t2892>Lucy was sleeping peacefully, but her breathing was stronger; I could see the bed cover moving as her chest rose and fell.</t2892> <t2893>Van Helsing sat at the head of the bed, carefully looking at Lucy.</t2893>
<t2894>The velvet band once again covered the red mark.</t2894> <t2895>I whispered this to the professor:</t2895>
<t2896>“What do you say about the mark on your neck?</t2896><t2897>”</t2897>
<t2898>“What are you saying?</t2898><t2899>”</t2899>
<t2900>“I haven't seen it yet,” I replied and immediately went to loosen the bandage right there.</t2900> <t2901>There were two holes right over her jugular vein; they weren't big but looked somewhat bruised, they didn't look healthy.</t2901> <t2902>It occurred to me that this wound, or whatever it was, could be the source of this apparent blood loss; but as soon as this thought formed in my mind, I dismissed it, because such a thing couldn't be possible.</t2902> <t2903>With the amount of blood she lost that left the poor girl this pale before the blood transfusion, the entire bed should have been stained red.</t2903>
<t2904>“Yes?” said Van Helsing.</t2904>
<t2905>“Yes,” I said, “I can't make any sense of it.”</t2905> <t2906>The professor stood up.</t2906> <t2907>“I must return to Amsterdam tonight,” he said.</t2907> <t2908>“There are books and other things I need there.</t2908> <t2909>You must stay here throughout the night and keep an eye on him.</t2909><t2910>”</t2910>
<t2911>"Shall I take a nurse with me?" I asked.</t2911>
<t2912>“We are the best nurses - you and I.</t2912> <t2913>Keep watch all night; make sure he is well-fed and nothing disturbs him.</t2913> <t2914>Then we can sleep, you and I.</t2914> <t2915>I will return as soon as possible.</t2915> <t2916>And then we can start.</t2916><t2917>”</t2917>
<t2918>“Can we start?” I said.</t2918> <t2919>“What do you mean?</t2919><t2920>”</t2920>
<t2921>As he hurried out, he said, "We will see!"</t2921> <t2922>A second later, he came back, stuck his head in through the door, and raised his index finger as if to warn, saying:</t2922>
<t2923>"Remember, it's your responsibility.</t2923> <t2924>If you leave it and it gets harmed, you won't be able to sleep peacefully anymore!</t2924><t2925>"</t2925>
<t2926>Dr. Seward's journal (continued)</t2926>
<t2927>September 8 - I sat by Lucy's side all night.</t2927> <t2928>The effect of the narcotic wore off towards twilight and she woke up on her own; she seemed like a different person compared to before the procedure.</t2928> <t2929>Her spirits were even good and she was filled with a happy liveliness, but I could see the traces of the absolute exhaustion she had been subjected to.</t2929> <t2930>When I told Mrs. Westenra that Dr. Van Helsing had ordered me to watch over Lucy, she almost scoffed at the idea, pointing out her daughter's renewed strength and perfect morale.</t2930> <t2931>But I was determined and made preparations for my long night watch.</t2931> <t2932>When her maid prepared her for the night, I went in; meanwhile, I had had my dinner and sat by her bedside.</t2932> <t2933>She did not object and looked at me with gratitude when our eyes met.</t2933> <t2934>After a long time, she seemed to fall asleep, but she struggled to gather herself and shook off sleep.</t2934> <t2935>This situation repeated itself several times with increasing efforts and shorter intervals as time went on.</t2935> <t2936>It was clear that she did not want to sleep, so I immediately addressed the issue:</t2936>
<t2937>“Don't you want to sleep?</t2937><t2938>”</t2938>
<t2939>“No; I am afraid.</t2939><t2940>”</t2940>
<t2941>“Afraid of sleeping!</t2941> <t2942>Why?</t2942> <t2943>Sleep is a blessing that we all seek desperately.</t2943><t2944>”</t2944>
<t2945>“Ah, if you are like me - if sleep is a sign of fear for you, it won't be like that!</t2945><t2946>”</t2946>
<t2947>“A sign of fear!</t2947> <t2948>What do you mean?</t2948><t2949>”</t2949>
<t2950>“I don't know; oh, I don't know.</t2950> <t2951>And that's what makes it so terrifying.</t2951> <t2952>All this helplessness overwhelms me while I'm asleep; until even thinking about it horrifies me.</t2952><t2953>”</t2953>
<t2954>“But my dear daughter, you can sleep tonight.</t2954> <t2955>I will be watching over you here and I can promise that nothing will happen.</t2955><t2956>”</t2956>
<t2957>"Ah, I can trust you!" I took advantage of the opportunity and said: "I promise you; if I see any sign that you are having a bad dream, I will wake you up immediately."</t2957><t2958>"</t2958>
<t2959>"Really?"</t2959> <t2960>"Oh, will you really wake me up?"</t2960> <t2961>"Then I will sleep."</t2961> <t2962>And almost as soon as he said this, he leaned back and fell asleep with a deep sigh of relief.</t2962>
<t2963>I watched him all night.</t2963> <t2964>He didn't move at all and kept sleeping a deep, peaceful, invigorating, and healing sleep.</t2964> <t2965>His lips were slightly parted and his chest rose and fell with the regularity of a pendulum.</t2965> <t2966>There was a smile on his face, and it was clear that he didn't have a single bad dream to disturb his peace of mind.</t2966>
<t2967>Early in the morning, the servant came and I handed Lucy over to her and returned home, because there were many things that worried me.</t2967> <t2968>I sent short telegrams to Van Helsing and Arthur, informing them of the flawless outcome of the procedure.</t2968> <t2969>It took me all day to finish my own tasks - which were many; by the time I managed to get information about my zoophagous patient, it was already dark.</t2969> <t2970>The report was good: He had been quite quiet throughout the past day and night.</t2970> <t2971>While I was having dinner, a telegram arrived from Van Helsing, who was in Amsterdam at the time, saying that it would be good for me to be at Hillingham tonight and that he would join me early in the morning after traveling by the night mail coach.</t2971>
<t2972>September 9.</t2972> <t2973>- When I arrived at Hillingham, I was quite tired and exhausted.</t2973> <t2974>I had barely slept for two nights and my brain was beginning to feel the numbness indicative of fatigue.</t2974> <t2975>Lucy was awake and in good spirits.</t2975> <t2976>As she shook hands with me, she looked sharply at my face and said:</t2976>
<t2977>“Tonight, you won't be sitting up.</t2977> <t2978>You are exhausted.</t2978> <t2979>I'm as good as I used to be, really good; if someone needs to stay up all night, I'll be the one staying up with you.”</t2979> <t2980>I didn't argue about it, I went and had my dinner.</t2980> <t2981>Lucy came with me and I had a perfect meal cheered by her pleasant presence and drank a few glasses of Porto wine that was beyond perfect.</t2981> <t2982>Then Lucy took me upstairs and showed me the room next to hers, where a warm fireplace was burning.</t2982> <t2983>“Now,” she said, “you must stay here.</t2983> <t2984>I will leave this door and my own door open.</t2984> <t2985>You can lie on the couch, because I know that when there is a patient nearby, nothing can convince you doctors to lie in bed.</t2985> <t2986>If I need anything, I will call out and you can come to me immediately.”</t2986> <t2987>I couldn't do anything but accept because I was “dog-tired” and even if I tried to stay up all night, I wouldn't be able to manage it.</t2987> <t2988>So, after making her promise once more that she would call out if she needed anything, I lay down on the couch and forgot everything.</t2988>

<t2990>September 9.</t2990> <t2991>- Tonight I feel very happy.</t2991> <t2992>I had become so weak that being able to think and walk again feels like sensing the daylight after a long-lasting east wind in a steel-like sky.</t2992> <t2993>Somehow, I feel Arthur very, very close to me.</t2993> <t2994>I feel as if his warm presence is warming me inside.</t2994> <t2995>I think illness and weakness are selfish things; they turn our inner eye and love towards ourselves, whereas health and strength leave the reins to Love, allowing thoughts and feelings to go wherever they please.</t2995> <t2996>I wish Arthur knew this!</t2996> <t2997>My dear, my dear, your ears must be ringing while you sleep, mine ring while I'm awake.</t2997> <t2998>Oh, the delightful sleep of last night!</t2998> <t2999>How well I slept while that dear, good Dr. Seward watched over me.</t2999> <t3000>And tonight I should not be afraid to sleep because he is so close, within calling distance.</t3000> <t3001>Thank you so much to everyone for treating me so well!</t3001> <t3002>Thank God!</t3002> <t3003>Good night, Arthur.</t3003>
<t3004>Dr. Seward's journal</t3004>
<t3005>September 10 - I realized the Professor's hand was on top of my head and woke up instantly.</t3005> <t3006>This is one of the things we learned in the mental hospital, no matter the cost.</t3006>
<t3007>“So, how is our patient?</t3007><t3008>”</t3008>
<t3009>"Well, when I left her side, or rather, when she left my side," I began to respond.</t3009>
<t3010>“Come on, let's see,” he said.</t3010> <t3011>And we entered the room together.</t3011>
<t3012>The curtain was drawn, and as Van Helsing quietly moved towards the bed like a cat, I also went to slowly open the curtain.</t3012>
<t3013>As I opened the curtain and the morning sun filled the room, I heard the Professor's sigh, and knowing how rare it was, a deadly fear pierced my heart.</t3013> <t3014>When I approached him, he recoiled, and there was no need for the anguished expression on his face to emphasize his exclamation of "Gott in Himmel!"27, a sign of his horror.</t3014> <t3015>He raised his hand and pointed to the bed; his stern face had fallen and turned ashen.</t3015> <t3016>I felt my knees begin to tremble.</t3016>
<t3017>With her terrifyingly pale color, looking more exhausted than ever, Lucy was lying on the bed as if she had fainted.</t3017> <t3018>Even her lips were completely white, and her gums appeared receded, as we sometimes see in corpses after a long illness.</t3018> <t3019>Van Helsing raised his foot to stomp the ground in anger, but the instinct for life and the habit of his many years prevented him from doing so, and he slowly lowered his foot.</t3019> <t3020>"Quick!" he said.</t3020> <t3021>"Bring the brandy."</t3021> <t3022>I rushed to the dining room and returned with the decanter of liquor.</t3022> <t3023>He moistened her poor white lips with it, and together we rubbed her palms, wrists, and heart.</t3023> <t3024>Van Helsing checked Lucy's heart, and after a few seconds of painful uncertainty, he said:</t3024>
<t3025>“It is not too late yet.</t3025> <t3026>Her heart is beating, weak as it may be, it is beating.</t3026> <t3027>Everything we did was in vain; we must start over.</t3027> <t3028>Young Arthur is no longer here; this time I must ask you, my friend John.”</t3028> <t3029>As he spoke, he plunged his hand into his bag and took out the equipment needed for the blood transfusion; I had taken off my jacket and rolled up the sleeve of my shirt.</t3029> <t3030>At this moment, there was neither the possibility nor the necessity for a narcotic; thus, without losing a moment, we began the procedure.</t3030> <t3031>After a while -that while had not felt short because, although it was given willingly, the draining of one's blood is a terrifying feeling- Van Helsing raised his finger to warn me.</t3031> <t3032>“Do not move,” he said, “but I fear, due to her increasing strength, she may wake up and this could be dangerous, oh, it could create great danger.</t3032> <t3033>I must take precautions.</t3033> <t3034>I will inject morphine under the skin.”</t3034> <t3035>Swiftly and skillfully, he set to work to achieve his purpose.</t3035> <t3036>The effect of this procedure on Lucy was not bad because her unconsciousness gracefully blended into a drug-induced sleep.</t3036> <t3037>With a personal pride, I could see a faint color returning to her pale cheeks and lips.</t3037> <t3038>No man can know what it feels like to have his own blood drawn into the veins of the woman he loves without experiencing it.</t3038>
<t3039>The professor was watching me with critical eyes.</t3039> <t3040>"That's enough," he said.</t3040> <t3041>"So soon?" I protested.</t3041> <t3042>"You had taken much more from Art."</t3042> <t3043>He responded to what I said with a sad smile:</t3043>
<t3044>"Oh, the young lady's lover, her fiancé.</t3044> <t3045>You have a lot of work to do for her and for others, and for now, this much will suffice.</t3045><t3046>"</t3046>
<t3047>When we stopped the procedure, while I was applying pressure to the cut with my finger, he attended to Lucy.</t3047> <t3048>While waiting for him to finish his work to attend to me, I lay down because I felt very exhausted and a bit sick.</t3048> <t3049>Soon, he bandaged my wound and sent me downstairs to get myself a glass of wine.</t3049> <t3050>As I was leaving the room, he followed me and almost whispered:</t3050>
<t3051>“Be careful, nothing should be said about this.</t3051> <t3052>If our young lover shows up unexpectedly as he did before, don't say a word to him.</t3052> <t3053>This will immediately scare and make him jealous.</t3053> <t3054>None of this should happen.</t3054> <t3055>That's why!</t3055><t3056>”</t3056>
<t3057>When I turned back, he looked at me carefully and said:</t3057>
<t3058>"You weren't too bad.</t3058> <t3059>Go to your room and lie down on your couch for a while; then have a hearty breakfast and come here to me.</t3059><t3060>"</t3060>
<t3061>I followed their instructions because I knew they were correct and wise.</t3061> <t3062>I had done my part and my next duty was to conserve my strength.</t3062> <t3063>I felt very weak, and in this weakness, some of the astonishment I had felt due to what was happening had faded.</t3063> <t3064>But I fell asleep on the couch, wondering how Lucy had deteriorated so much and how she had lost such a large amount of blood without leaving the slightest trace.</t3064> <t3065>I suppose I must have continued my curiosity in my dream, because as I slept and woke, my thoughts kept revolving around the small holes in her neck and the rough, dough-like appearance of their edges, even though they were tiny.</t3065>
<t3066>Lucy continued to sleep soundly until the later hours of the day; when she woke up, she was quite well and strong, though not as much as the previous day.</t3066> <t3067>After seeing her, Van Helsing gave strict orders not to leave her side for a moment and left me in charge before going out for a walk.</t3067> <t3068>In the hall, I heard his voice asking for the way to the nearest telegraph office.</t3068>
<t3069>Lucy chatted with me comfortably, as if she was unaware that something was wrong.</t3069><t3070>I tried to keep her occupied and interested.</t3070><t3071>When her mother came upstairs to see her, she didn't seem to notice any change, but she gratefully said to me:</t3071>
<t3072>"Dr. Seward, we owe you a great deal for all you have done, but seriously, you must take care not to overwork yourself.</t3072> <t3073>You look pale as well.</t3073> <t3074>You need a wife to look after you and take care of you; yes, indeed!" As he said this, Lucy blushed, if only for a moment, because her veins, wasted by illness, could not endure such an unusual amount of blood rushing to her head for long.</t3074> <t3075>Her reaction was an excessive pallor when she turned to me with pleading eyes.</t3075> <t3076>I smiled and nodded, putting my finger to my lips; she sighed and sank back into her pillows.</t3076>
<t3077>Within a few hours, Van Helsing returned and immediately said: "Now you go home and eat and drink plenty.</t3077> <t3078>Strengthen yourself.</t3078> <t3079>Tonight, I will stay here and keep watch over the young lady.</t3079> <t3080>We must monitor the situation and not let anyone else learn about it.</t3080> <t3081>I have very important reasons for this.</t3081> <t3082>No, don't ask what they are; think whatever you want.</t3082> <t3083>Don't hesitate to consider even the most unlikely possibilities.</t3083> <t3084>Good night.</t3084><t3085>"</t3085>
<t3086>Two maids came to me and asked if both of them or one of them could stay up all night with Miss Lucy.</t3086> <t3087>They begged me to allow it; when I told them that Dr. Van Helsing's wish was that only he or I should stay up with Lucy, they quite heartbreakingly asked me to plead with the foreign gentleman.</t3087> <t3088>Their kindness touched me deeply.</t3088> <t3089>Perhaps I was so affected because I am weak at the moment, or perhaps their devotion was entirely due to Lucy, because I have seen similar acts of kindness from women many times before.</t3089> <t3090>I returned here in time for a late dinner; I checked on my patients - they were all well; and I am recording this while waiting for sleep.</t3090> <t3091>And now, sleep is coming.</t3091><t3092>”</t3092>
<t3093>September 11.</t3093> <t3094>- This afternoon I went to Hillingham.</t3094> <t3095>I found Van Helsing in an excellent mood and Lucy much better.</t3095> <t3096>Shortly after my arrival, a large package arrived for the Professor from abroad.</t3096> <t3097>He opened it, looking very impressed - supposedly, of course - and showed a huge bunch of white flowers.</t3097>
<t3098>"These are for you, Miss Lucy," he said.</t3098>
<t3099>"For me?"</t3099> <t3100>"Oh, Dr. Van Helsing!"</t3100><t3101>"</t3101>
<t3102>“Yes, dear, but not for you to play with.</t3102> <t3103>These are medicines.”</t3103> <t3104>Upon hearing this, Lucy frowned.</t3104> <t3105>“No, but they won't be boiled to extract their essence or take on a nauseating form; so, there's no need to wrinkle that lovely nose of yours, or I'll have to tell my friend Arthur what a pain it would be for him to see such beauty, which he loves so much, distorted.</t3105> <t3106>Ah, sweet little lady, there, that lovely nose is straight again.</t3106> <t3107>It has healing properties, but you don't know how.</t3107> <t3108>I'm placing it by your window, making a beautiful garland and hanging it around your neck so that you sleep well.</t3108> <t3109>Ah, yes! Like the lotus flower, these will make you forget your troubles.</t3109> <t3110>They smell like the waters of Lethe, like the waters of that fountain of youth the conquistadors sought and found too late in Florida.</t3110><t3111>”</t3111>
<t3112>While the professor was speaking, Lucy was examining and smelling the flowers.</t3112> <t3113>Half laughing and half disgusted, she immediately threw the flowers to the ground and said:</t3113>
<t3114>“Oh Professor, I think you are joking with me.</t3114> <t3115>These flowers are just garlic as we know it.</t3115><t3116>”</t3116>
<t3117>On the contrary, Van Helsing stood up, his iron jaw clenched, his brush-like eyebrows merged, and with all his sternness, he said:</t3117>
<t3118>“Don't underestimate me!</t3118> <t3119>I never joke!</t3119> <t3120>There is a serious purpose in everything I do and I warn you, do not oppose me.</t3120> <t3121>Even if not for your own good, for the good of others, be careful.” Then, seeing that poor Lucy was rightfully afraid, he continued his words more gently: “Ah, little lady, dear, don't be afraid of me.</t3121> <t3122>I am doing this for your own good; but there is great power in these ordinary flowers that will benefit you.</t3122> <t3123>Look, I am placing them in your room with my own hands.</t3123> <t3124>I am making the garland you will wear around your neck with my own hands.</t3124> <t3125>But shush! Don't tell others who ask too many curious questions.</t3125> <t3126>We must obey and silence is also a part of obedience; obedience will ensure that you go strong and healthy into the loving arms that await you.</t3126> <t3127>Now stay still for a moment.</t3127> <t3128>Come with me, John, my friend, and let's adorn the room with the garlic I had grown in my friend Vanderpool's greenhouse throughout the year, brought from Haarlem.</t3128> <t3129>I had to send a telegram yesterday, otherwise, they wouldn't be here today.</t3129><t3130>”</t3130>
<t3131>We took the flowers with us and entered the room.</t3131> <t3132>The professor's actions were definitely strange, and what we were doing was not something you would find in any medical book I had ever heard of.</t3132> <t3133>First, he closed the windows and tightened the latches; then he took a handful of flowers and rubbed them along the window sashes as if wanting to ensure that any breeze coming in would be filled with the smell of garlic.</t3133> <t3134>Then, with that bunch, he rubbed the entire door frame, the bottom, the top, and both sides, and did the same around the fireplace.</t3134> <t3135>All of this seemed very meaningless to me, and I immediately said:</t3135>
<t3136>“Well, Professor, I know you always have a reason for the things you do, but this definitely confuses me.</t3136> <t3137>It's a good thing there's no skeptic here, otherwise they would say you were casting spells to keep out evil spirits.</t3137><t3138>”</t3138>
<t3139>“Maybe I am doing that!” Lucy had replied quietly as she started preparing the garland to put around her neck.</t3139>
<t3140>Then, we waited for Lucy to get ready for the night, and when the young lady went to bed, the Professor entered the room and placed the garlic garland around her neck with his own hands.</t3140> <t3141>His last words to Lucy were:</t3141>
<t3142>“Be careful not to touch this; even if the room feels suffocating to you, do not open the window or the door tonight.</t3142><t3143>”</t3143>
<t3144>“I promise,” said Lucy, “And a thousand thanks to both of you for the kindness you have shown me!</t3144> <t3145>Oh, what have I done to be blessed with friends like these?</t3145><t3146>”</t3146>
<t3147>As I was leaving the house with the only horse-drawn carriage waiting for us, Van Helsing said:</t3147>
<t3148>"Tonight I can sleep peacefully, and I need sleep - two nights of travel, plenty of reading on the day in between, followed by a day of much worry and a sleepless night.</t3148> <t3149>Come by early tomorrow morning and pick me up, and let's go see our lovely little lady who has become much stronger with the 'magic' I've been working on.</t3149> <t3150>Ho! Ho!"</t3150>
<t3151>He looked so confident that I recalled the devastating impact on my self-confidence I had felt two nights ago, and I was filled with fear and a vague sense of dread.</t3151> <t3152>The reason I hesitated to tell this to my friend must be my weakness, but I felt it increasingly, like unshed tears.</t3152>
<t3153>XI</t3153>
<t3154>Lucy Westenra's diary</t3154>
<t3155>September 12 - How kind everyone is to me.</t3155><t3156>I love that dear Dr. Van Helsing so much.</t3156><t3157>I wonder why he is so eager about these flowers.</t3157><t3158>He absolutely frightened me, he was so angry.</t3158><t3159>But still, he must be right about it, because the flowers have already calmed me down.</t3159><t3160>Somehow, I am not afraid of being alone tonight and I can fall asleep without fear.</t3160><t3161>I will not mind the flapping outside the window.</t3161><t3162>Oh, this terrible struggle against sleep lately; the agony of insomnia or the fear of sleep that brings such unknown horrors to me!</t3162><t3163>How blessed are some people in whose lives there is no fear, horror, or apprehension, and to whom sleep comes every night as a blessing, bringing nothing but sweet dreams.</t3163><t3164>Here I am tonight, waiting for sleep, and like Ophelia in the play, "I have been laid with virgin crants and maiden strewments."</t3164><t3165>I never liked garlic before, but tonight it seems very pleasant!</t3165><t3166>There is peace in its scent; I already feel sleep coming.</t3166><t3167>Good night to everyone.</t3167>
<t3168>Dr. Seward's journal</t3168>
<t3169>September 13 - I stopped by Berkeley and found Van Helsing ready as usual, right on time.</t3169> <t3170>The carriage called by the hotel was waiting for us.</t3170> <t3171>The professor took his bag, which he now carried with him all the time.</t3171>
<t3172>Let's write everything down exactly.</t3172> <t3173>Van Helsing and I arrived at Hillingham at eight o'clock.</t3173> <t3174>It was a beautiful morning; the bright sunlight and the freshness of early autumn seemed like nature was concluding its annual duty.</t3174> <t3175>The leaves were turning into various beautiful colors, but they had not yet started to fall from the trees.</t3175> <t3176>When we entered the house, we encountered Ms. Westenra coming out of the living room.</t3176> <t3177>She always rises early.</t3177> <t3178>She greeted us warmly and said:</t3178>
<t3179>“You will be pleased to know that Lucy is better.</t3179> <t3180>The dear child is still sleeping, I looked into her room and saw her, but I did not go in so as not to disturb her.”</t3180> <t3181>The Professor smiled and looked very delighted.</t3181> <t3182>Rubbing his hands, he said, “Aha! I thought I had diagnosed the case.</t3182> <t3183>My treatment is working,” to which Ms. Westenra replied:</t3183>
<t3184>“Don’t take all the credit for yourself, Doctor.</t3184> <t3185>Lucy’s condition this morning is partly thanks to me.</t3185><t3186>”</t3186>
<t3187>"What do you mean?" asked the Professor.</t3187>
<t3188>“Alright, I was worried about my daughter at night and went to her room.</t3188> <t3189>She was sleeping soundly - so soundly that even my entrance into the room did not wake her.</t3189> <t3190>But the room was extremely stuffy.</t3190> <t3191>There were those terrible, heavy-scented flowers everywhere; moreover, a bunch of them was also hanging around her neck.</t3191> <t3192>I feared that this heavy scent would be too much for the poor child in her weakened state, and so, I took them all away and slightly opened the window to let in some fresh air.</t3192> <t3193>I am sure you will be pleased with her condition.</t3193><t3194>”</t3194>
<t3195>He walked towards his own room where he usually had his breakfast in the early hours.</t3195> <t3196>While Ms. Westenra was speaking, I watched the Professor's face and saw it turn an ashen gray color.</t3196> <t3197>I saw that he managed to keep his composure while the poor lady was with us, because he knew the woman's condition and how a sudden shock could harm her; in fact, he even smiled at Ms. Westenra when he opened the door for her to enter her room.</t3197> <t3198>But as soon as the lady disappeared from sight, he suddenly pulled me into the dining room with a sharp movement and closed the door.</t3198>
<t3199>Then, for the first time in my life, I saw Van Helsing lose his composure.</t3199> <t3200>In silent despair, he raised his hands above his head and then clapped his palms together in helplessness; finally, he sat down in the chair and began to sob uncontrollably with loud, dry sobs that seemed to come from the pain in his heart, covering his face with his hands.</t3200> <t3201>Then, as if addressing the entire universe, he raised his arms again.</t3201> <t3202>“My God! My God! My God!” he said.</t3202> <t3203>“What have we done, what has this poor thing done to be surrounded by such suffering?</t3203> <t3204>Is the fate brought down from the pagan world of old still among us that such things must happen in this way?</t3204> <t3205>This poor mother, unaware of everything and wanting the best for everything, is doing something that harms her daughter's body and soul; moreover, we must not tell her, we must not even warn her, or she will die, they will both die.</t3205> <t3206>Oh, how trapped we are!</t3206> <t3207>How all the powers of the devil are working against us!” Suddenly, he sprang to his feet.</t3207> <t3208>“Come,” he said, “come, we must look at the situation and take action.</t3208> <t3209>Whether it is the devil before us or not, or all the devils together, it does not matter; whatever happens, we will fight.”</t3209> <t3210>He went to the hall door to get his bag, and we went up to Lucy's room together.</t3210>
<t3211>As Van Helsing went towards the bed, I opened the curtain again.</t3211> <t3212>This time, he was not frightened while looking at the same horrifying, pale, wretched face.</t3212> <t3213>There was an expression of stern sorrow and infinite pity on his face.</t3213>
<t3214>Taking a deep breath through his nose, which conveyed a lot, he murmured, "Just as I expected."</t3214> <t3215>Without saying a word, he went and locked the door, then started arranging the necessary tools for a new blood transfusion on the small table.</t3215> <t3216>I realized this necessity long ago and began to take off my jacket, but he warned me with his hand and stopped me.</t3216> <t3217>"No!" he said.</t3217> <t3218>"You should conduct the procedure today.</t3218> <t3219>I will give the blood.</t3219> <t3220>You are already weakened."</t3220> <t3221>As he said this, he took off his jacket and rolled up the sleeve of his shirt.</t3221>
<t3222>Again the blood transfusion procedure; again the narcotic drug; again the slight color starting to return to the ash-colored cheeks and the regular breathing indicating healthy sleep.</t3222> <t3223>This time, I watched Van Helsing recover and rest.</t3223>
<t3224>A little later, msWestenra had the opportunity to tell her not to remove anything from Lucy's room without consulting her, that the flowers had healing value, and that inhaling their scent was part of the healing process.</t3224> <t3225>Then, she decided to take personal care of the case, saying that she would keep watch tonight and tomorrow night and would send word to me if I was needed.</t3225>
<t3226>After another hour passed, Lucy woke up from her sleep, refreshed, lively, and not looking too bad despite the terrible incident that had happened to her.</t3226>
<t3227>What does all this mean?</t3227> <t3228>I'm starting to wonder if getting used to living among madmen for so long has begun to negatively affect my own brain.</t3228>
<t3229>Lucy Westenra's diary</t3229>
<t3230>September 17.</t3230> <t3231>- Four days and four nights of peace.</t3231> <t3232>Again, I feel so strengthened that I hardly recognize myself.</t3232> <t3233>It’s as if I have just awakened from a long nightmare to see the clean morning air surrounding me with beautiful sunlight.</t3233> <t3234>I have vague, half-formed memories of long, anxious waits and fears, of darkness without even the slightest hope that would make the existing tension even more destructive, of long periods of oblivion, and of returning to life like a diver freed from the heavy pressure of water.</t3234> <t3235>But, with Dr. Van Helsing by my side, all these bad dreams seem like the past; all the sounds that scared me to the point of losing my mind - the flapping wings at the window, the voices that seemed close but were heard from afar, the harsh voices commanding me to do who knows what - seem like the past.</t3235> <t3236>I no longer go to bed afraid to sleep.</t3236> <t3237>I don’t even try to stay awake.</t3237> <t3238>I’ve started to quite like garlic, and every day a box full of it comes for me from Haarlem.</t3238> <t3239>Tonight, Dr. Van Helsing is leaving because he needs to be in Amsterdam for a day.</t3239> <t3240>But there’s no need for anyone to keep watch over me; I am well enough to be left alone.</t3240> <t3241>God bless my mother, dear Arthur, and all our friends who have been so kind!</t3241> <t3242>I don’t even feel alone, because last night Dr. Van Helsing slept in his chair for a long time.</t3242> <t3243>I found him asleep twice when I woke up; but despite the almost angry banging of tree branches, bats, or something else against the windows, I wasn’t afraid to fall asleep again.</t3243>
<t3244>“Pall Mall” newspaper, September 18</t3244>
<t3245>FUGITIVE WOLF</t3245>
<t3246>Our reporter's fear-filled interview</t3246>
<t3247>Interview with the zookeeper</t3247>
<t3248>After numerous inquiries and almost as many refusals, and after constantly invoking the words of the Pall Mall Gazette as a sort of charm, I finally managed to find the keeper of the section where the wolf enclosure is located in the zoo.</t3248> <t3249>Thomas Bilder lives in one of the cottages just behind the elephant house, and when I found him, he was just sitting down to his tea.</t3249> <t3250>Thomas and his wife are hospitable, elderly, childless people, and if the ordinary example of their hospitality that I experienced is any indication, their lives must be quite comfortable.</t3250> <t3251>The keeper did not broach the subject of "business," as he called it, until the meal was over, and we were all content with this.</t3251> <t3252>Then, when the table was cleared, he lit his pipe and began to speak:</t3252>
<t3253>“Sir, you can now start talking and ask me anything you want.</t3253> <t3254>You will forgive me for refusing to discuss professional matters before dinner.</t3254> <t3255>Before asking questions to the wolves, jackals, and hyenas in our department, I give them their tea.</t3255><t3256>”</t3256>
<t3257>With the desire to put him in a talkative mood, I asked, "What do you mean by asking them questions?"</t3257>
<t3258>“Like the ruckus young men make to show off to their girls, hitting them on the head with a stick is one way; pulling their ears is another way.</t3258> <t3259>I don't care which is done first - I expect them to take their mischief and coffee before hitting them with a stick or, so to speak, scratching their ears before they leave their meals.</t3259> <t3260>Remember,” he added thoughtfully, “we also have a bit of animal nature in us.</t3260> <t3261>You come asking questions about my work and I, like a grumpy old man, would rather see you burst before answering your damn ten shillings.</t3261> <t3262>Even when you mockingly asked me if I needed the Chief's permission before asking me a question.</t3262> <t3263>No offense, but did I tell you to go to hell?</t3263><t3264>”</t3264>
<t3265>"You said.</t3265><t3266>"</t3266>
<t3267>“When he said he would report me for using foul language, I felt like I had been struck in the head, but ten shillings saved the day.</t3267> <t3268>I wasn't going to fight, so I waited for the meal; I acted like wolves, lions, and tigers.</t3268> <t3269>But God must love you because the old lady stabbed a big slice of her cake into me and swirled my insides with her old floral teapot, I felt relieved, and you can scratch my ears as much as you want, you won't hear a single growl from me.</t3269> <t3270>Start with your questions.</t3270> <t3271>I know you're going to bring up the escaped wolf.</t3271><t3272>”</t3272>
<t3273>"Absolutely.</t3273> <t3274>I want you to tell me your thoughts on that matter.</t3274> <t3275>Just explain how it happened; once I learn the concrete facts, I will ask you to tell me why you think it happened and how you think all of this will conclude.</t3275><t3276>"</t3276>
<t3277>“Alright boss.</t3277> <t3278>Here’s the whole story: The wolf we named Bersicker was one of the three gray wolves that came from Norway to Jamrach’s31, and we bought him from there four years ago.</t3278> <t3279>He was a sweet, well-behaved wolf who never caused a single problem worth mentioning.</t3279> <t3280>I was very surprised that he, out of all the other animals here, wanted to escape.</t3280> <t3281>But there you go, you can’t trust wolves just like you can’t trust women.</t3281><t3282>”</t3282>
<t3283>"Don't listen to her, sir!" Ms. Tom interjected with a cheerful smile.</t3283> <t3284>"She has been taking care of animals for so long that we should be thankful she hasn't turned into a wolf herself!</t3284> <t3285>But there is no evil in her.</t3285><t3286>"</t3286>
<t3287>"Yes, sir, when I first heard the commotion yesterday, it had been about two hours since I had fed the animals.</t3287> <t3288>I was preparing bedding from straw in the monkey cage for a young puma; but when I heard the faint barking and howling, I came immediately.</t3288> <t3289>Bersicker was clawing at the bars like crazy, as if he wanted to get out.</t3289> <t3290>There weren't many people around that day, there was only one man nearby; tall and thin, with a hooked nose and a pointed beard with a few white hairs.</t3290> <t3291>He had a stern and cold appearance, red eyes, and I didn't like him much because the animals seemed to be angry with him.</t3291> <t3292>He was wearing white gloves and pointed at the animals, saying to me, 'Keeper, these wolves seem to be agitated by something.'</t3292><t3293>"</t3293>
<t3294>“</t3294><t3295>‘Maybe they were suspicious of you,’ I said because I didn't like the air he gave himself.</t3295> <t3296>As I hoped, he didn't get angry, but he laughed arrogantly with his mouth full of white, sharp teeth.</t3296> <t3297>‘Oh no, they don't like me very much,’ he said.</t3297>
<t3298>‘Ah, yes, they like it,’ I said, imitating him.</t3298> <t3299>‘They love a bone or two to clean their teeth at tea time; it seems like you have a sackful of them.</t3299><t3300>’</t3300>
<t3301>Well, it's strange but when the animals saw us talking, they lay down on the ground and when I went to Bersicker, he let me scratch his ears as usual.</t3301> <t3302>Then that man came and, I swear, if he didn't put his hand and scratch the old wolf's ears!</t3302><t3303>”</t3303>
<t3304>'Be careful,' I said.</t3304> <t3305>'Bersicker is wild.'</t3305><t3306></t3306>
<t3307>‘Never mind,’ he said.</t3307> <t3308>‘I'm used to them!</t3308><t3309>’</t3309>
<t3310>"Are you involved in this too?" I said, taking off my hat because someone who deals with animals like wolves is a friend of the caretakers.</t3310>
<t3311>‘No!’ he said, ‘I am not exactly in this business, but I have raised many animals.’</t3311> <t3312>And as he said this, he lifted his hat like a lord and walked away.</t3312> <t3313>Old Bersicker watched the man until he disappeared from sight, then went and lay in a corner and did not move all evening.</t3313> <t3314>Well, last night, as soon as the moon rose, all the wolves here started howling.</t3314> <t3315>There was no reason for them to howl.</t3315> <t3316>There was no one nearby except someone who was clearly calling for their dog on Park Street.</t3316> <t3317>I went outside a couple of times to check if everything was okay; everything was fine and then the howling stopped.</t3317> <t3318>Just before midnight, I took one more round before going inside and damn it!</t3318> <t3319>When I came to Old Bersicker's cage, I saw that the bars were broken and bent, and the cage was empty.</t3319> <t3320>And that's exactly all I know.</t3320><t3321>”</t3321>
<t3322>“Has anyone else seen anything?”</t3322> <t3323>“One of our gardeners saw a gray dog coming from the garden fences while he was coming from the grove at that time.</t3323> <t3324>At least, that's what he says.</t3324> <t3325>I don't quite believe it, because if that's the case, he didn't say a word about it to his wife when he came home; but when it was discovered that the wolf had escaped and Bersicker was searched for all night in the zoo, he remembered seeing something.</t3325> <t3326>I think that grove confused him.”</t3326> <t3327>“Now Mr. Bilder, do you have any idea why the wolf escaped?</t3327><t3328>”</t3328>
<t3329>“Well, sir,” he said with a doubtful humility.</t3329> <t3330>“I think there is; but I can't tell if you'll be satisfied with this view.</t3330><t3331>”</t3331>
<t3332>“Of course I would.</t3332> <t3333>If someone like you, who knows animals through experience, cannot take the risk of making a good guess, then who can try?</t3333><t3334>”</t3334>
<t3335>“Well then, sir, I explain it this way; in my opinion, the wolf escaped from here because it wanted to go outside.”</t3335> <t3336>When I saw how genuinely Thomas and his wife laughed at this joke, I realized that it had worked before and that the entire explanation was an elaborate deception.</t3336> <t3337>I couldn't compete with the venerable Thomas in terms of jokes, but I knew a more certain way to his heart, and I said:</t3337>
<t3338>"Now Mr. Bilder, let's assume that the first half of that gold coin worked and that when you explained what you thought would happen, your brother would also be yours.</t3338><t3339>"</t3339>
<t3340>Quickly, "You're right," he said.</t3340> <t3341>"Forgive me for teasing you, but this old woman winked at me as if she wanted me to continue the joke.</t3341><t3342>"</t3342>
<t3343>“Not at all!” said the old woman.</t3343>
<t3344>“I think this way: The wolf is hiding somewhere.</t3344> <t3345>The gardener said it galloped northward faster than a horse could go; but I don't believe him, because you know sir, wolves don't gallop, nor do dogs, they weren't made that way.</t3345> <t3346>Wolves are good in storybooks and, in my opinion, when they are in packs and chasing something more scared of them, they can make a lot of noise and tear apart whatever they are chasing.</t3346> <t3347>But God bless you, in real life, the wolf is a weak creature, not half as smart or brave as a good dog, and it doesn't have even a quarter of the fight in it.</t3347> <t3348>This wolf isn't even used to fighting or taking care of itself and is most likely hiding somewhere in the zoo, trembling, and if it can think at all, it's wondering where it will find its breakfast; or it has gone a bit lower and is in a coal cellar.</t3348> <t3349>Come on!</t3349> <t3350>Won't the cook who goes down to get a bottle of rum be surprised to see its green eyes staring at him!</t3350> <t3351>If it can't find food, it will have to search, and maybe after a while, it will spot a butcher's shop by chance.</t3351> <t3352>If not, if a soldier goes for a walk and leaves the baby in the pram - well, I won't be surprised if there's one baby less in the census.</t3352> <t3353>That's all.</t3353><t3354>”</t3354>
<t3355>As something appeared at the window, I was handing him half a gold coin, and Mr. Bilder's face doubled its normal length in astonishment.</t3355>
<t3356>“God bless me!” he said.</t3356> <t3357>“If old Bersicker hasn't come back on his own!</t3357><t3358>”</t3358>
<t3359>He went and opened the door; in my opinion, a rather unnecessary action.</t3359> <t3360>I have always thought that a wild animal never looks as beautiful as when there is a solid barrier between us; personal experience has strengthened this thought rather than weakened it.</t3360>
<t3361>But ultimately, there's nothing like habit because neither Bilder's nor his wife's thoughts about the wolf were different from what I thought about dogs.</t3361> <t3362>The animal itself, the ancestor of all known wolves, Little Red Riding Hood's old friend, was as peaceful and well-mannered as when he gained the girl's trust in disguise.</t3362>
<t3363>The entire scene was an indescribable tragicomedy.</t3363> <t3364>The bad wolf, who had paralyzed all of London for half a day and caused the children in the city to tremble in their shoes, stood at the door in remorse and was welcomed and caressed like a cunning, prodigal son.</t3364> <t3365>Old Bilder examined him from head to toe with a gentle concern and, when he was done with this penitent, said:</t3365>
<t3366>“See, I knew that poor old man would get into trouble; didn't I say so from the beginning?</t3366> <t3367>His head is full of cuts and broken glass pieces.</t3367> <t3368>He must have jumped over a damn wall or something.</t3368> <t3369>It's a shame that people are allowed to put broken bottles on top of their walls.</t3369> <t3370>Look, this is what happens in the end.</t3370> <t3371>Come on now.</t3371> <t3372>Bersicker.</t3372><t3373>”</t3373>
<t3374>He took the wolf and locked it in a cage along with a piece of meat that probably matched the amount of a well-fed calf, and went to report the situation.</t3374>
<t3375>I also set out to report the only specific information given today about the strange escape at the zoo.</t3375>

<t3377>September 17 - After dinner, due to the pressure of other tasks and the numerous visits to Lucy, I unfortunately worked in my room to complete my remaining tasks.</t3377> <t3378>Suddenly, the door opened and my patient, whose face was contorted with anger, burst in.</t3378> <t3379>I was stunned, because it was almost unheard of for a patient to enter the Administrator's room of their own accord.</t3379> <t3380>Without hesitating for even a moment, he came directly at me.</t3380> <t3381>He had a dinner knife in his hand, and seeing that it was dangerous, I tried to keep the table between us.</t3381> <t3382>But he was far too fast and far too strong for me; thus, before I could regain my balance, he struck me with the knife and cut my left wrist quite seriously.</t3382> <t3383>However, before he could attack again, I lunged at him with my right hand and knocked him flat on his back.</t3383> <t3384>My wrist was bleeding heavily, forming a small pool on the carpet.</t3384> <t3385>Seeing that my friend had no intention of further struggle, I busied myself with bandaging my wrist without taking my eyes off the person lying on the ground.</t3385> <t3386>When the nurses rushed in and we turned our attention to him, what he was doing absolutely sickened me.</t3386> <t3387>Lying face down on the floor, like a dog, he was licking the blood that had dripped from my wounded wrist.</t3387> <t3388>He was easily caught and, to my surprise, went quite docilely with the nurses; as he left, he kept repeating these words: "The blood is the life!</t3388> <t3389>The blood is the life!</t3389><t3390>"</t3390>
<t3391>Right now, I cannot afford to lose any more blood: I have already lost too much blood for my physical well-being, and besides, the prolonged tension caused by Lucy's illness and its horrifying stages has badly affected me.</t3391> <t3392>I am overly excited and exhausted; I need to rest, rest, rest.</t3392> <t3393>Fortunately, Van Helsing did not call me, so I don't have to give up my sleep; I couldn't manage without it tonight.</t3393>
<t3394>From Van Helsing in Antwerp to Carfax</t3394>
<t3395>Telegram to Seward</t3395>

<t3399>September 17.</t3399> <t3400>- Do not neglect to be at Hillingham tonight.</t3400> <t3401>If you cannot stay by her side constantly, go to her room frequently and make sure the flowers are in place; it is very important; do not neglect it.</t3401> <t3402>I will be with you as early as possible when I arrive.</t3402>
<t3403>Dr. Seward's journal</t3403>
<t3404>September 18.</t3404> <t3405>- I have just set out for the London train.</t3405> <t3406>The arrival of Van Helsing’s telegram upset me greatly.</t3406> <t3407>A whole night was lost, and through a bitter experience, I know what can happen in a single night.</t3407> <t3408>Of course, there is a possibility that everything is fine, but what could have happened?</t3408> <t3409>Clearly, there is a dreadful fate hovering over us, as every possible accident is hindering everything we try to do.</t3409> <t3410>I will take this cylinder with me, and thus I can complete my record on Lucy’s phonograph.</t3410>
<t3411>The note left by Lucy Westenra</t3411>
<t3412>September 17.</t3412> <t3413>Night.</t3413> <t3414>- I am writing this and leaving it to be seen so that no one gets into trouble because of me.</t3414> <t3415>This is a complete record of what happened tonight.</t3415> <t3416>I think I am dying of weakness and can barely find the strength to write, but I must write even if I die doing so.</t3416>
<t3417>As usual, I lay down paying attention to whether the flowers were placed in the spots indicated by Dr. Van Helsing, and soon fell asleep.</t3417>
<t3418>I woke up to the sound of wings outside the window, which I now know very well, starting from my sleepwalking episode on the slope in Whitby where Mina had saved me.</t3418> <t3419>I wasn't afraid, but I wished Dr. Seward—or as Dr. Van Helsing suggested—was in the next room so I could call out to him.</t3419> <t3420>I tried to sleep, but I couldn't.</t3420> <t3421>Then, as before, I became afraid to sleep and decided to stay awake.</t3421> <t3422>Ironically, whenever I don't want to sleep, sleep tries to come; so, fearing to be alone, I opened my door and called out, "Is anyone there?"</t3422> <t3423>No response came.</t3423> <t3424>I hesitated to wake my mother, so I closed my door again.</t3424> <t3425>Then, from the bushes outside, I heard a howl that resembled a dog's but was harsher and deeper.</t3425> <t3426>I went to the window and looked out but saw nothing except a large bat clearly hitting the window with its wings.</t3426> <t3427>So I returned to bed but decided not to sleep.</t3427> <t3428>A little later, the door opened, and my mother looked in; she realized I was awake from my movement and came in to sit beside me.</t3428> <t3429>In a voice even sweeter and softer than usual, she said, "I was worried about you, my dear, and came to see if you were alright.</t3429><t3430>"</t3430>
<t3431>I was afraid she might catch a chill sitting there, so I asked her to come and sleep with me. She got into bed and lay down beside me; she didn't take off her dressing gown because she said she would only stay for a little while and then return to her own bed.</t3431> <t3432>There, as she lay in my arms and I in hers, we again heard the sound of wings at the window.</t3432> <t3433>My mother was startled, a little frightened, and cried out, "What was that?"</t3433> <t3434>I tried to calm her, and eventually succeeded, and she lay quietly; but I could hear her poor heart beating wildly.</t3434> <t3435>A while later, the deep howling sound came again from the bushes, and shortly after, there was a great crash at the window, and a large amount of broken glass scattered on the floor.</t3435> <t3436>The curtain blew open with the wind that rushed in; in the opening of the broken window stood the head of a giant, gaunt, gray wolf.</t3436> <t3437>My mother screamed in fear and struggled to sit up in bed, reaching for something that might help her.</t3437> <t3438>Among other things, she grabbed the garland that Dr. Van Helsing had insisted I wear around my neck and tore it off.</t3438> <t3439>She sat pointing at the wolf for a second or two, a strange and terrifying gurgling sound coming from her throat; then she collapsed as if struck by lightning, and when her head hit my forehead, it caused me to be dazed for a moment.</t3439> <t3440>The room and everything around seemed to be spinning.</t3440> <t3441>I fixed my eyes on the window, but the wolf had withdrawn its head, and through the broken window, thousands of tiny particles were entering, swirling around like a column of dust that travelers say they see in the desert during a sandstorm.</t3441> <t3442>I tried to pull myself together, but it felt as if I were under a spell, and the body of my poor mother, already beginning to cool - for her dear heart had stopped beating - weighed heavily upon me; for a while, I remembered nothing.</t3442>
<t3443>The time it took for me to regain consciousness wasn't long, but it felt very, very terrifying.</t3443> <t3444>A bell was ringing somewhere nearby; all the dogs in the vicinity were howling, and a nightingale was singing in the thicket just outside.</t3444> <t3445>I was stunned and bewildered with pain, horror, and weakness, but the nightingale's voice was like the voice of my dead mother who had come back to comfort me.</t3445> <t3446>The voice seemed to have awakened the servants too, because I could hear the sound of their bare feet outside my door.</t3446> <t3447>I called out to them, they came in, and when they realized what was lying in my bed, they screamed in terror.</t3447> <t3448>The wind blew in through the window and the door slammed shut.</t3448> <t3449>They lifted my dear mother's corpse and, after I got up, they laid her on the bed and covered her.</t3449> <t3450>They were so frightened and tense that I ordered them to go to the dining room and have a glass of wine each.</t3450> <t3451>The door opened for a moment and then closed again.</t3451> <t3452>The servants screamed and all went to the dining room together; I laid all my flowers on my mother's chest.</t3452> <t3453>While they were there, I remembered what Dr. Van Helsing had told me, but I didn't want to move them, and besides, I was going to ask some of the servants to stay with me through the night.</t3453> <t3454>I was surprised that the servants did not return.</t3454> <t3455>I called out to them, but received no answer, so I went to the dining room to look for them.</t3455>
<t3456>I was devastated when I saw what had happened.</t3456> <t3457>All four of them were lying on the ground, breathing heavily and helplessly.</t3457> <t3458>The sherry decanter was half full on the table, but there was a strange, bitter smell in the air.</t3458> <t3459>I became suspicious and examined the decanter.</t3459> <t3460>It smelled like laudanum, and when I looked at the sideboard, I saw that the bottle my mother's doctor used to -oh, once used to- use for her was empty.</t3460> <t3461>What am I going to do?</t3461> <t3462>What am I going to do?</t3462> <t3463>I returned to the room to be with my mother.</t3463> <t3464>I can't leave her, and except for the servants who were drugged and put to sleep, I'm all alone.</t3464> <t3465>Alone with the dead! I don't dare go outside, because I can hear the deep howling of the wolf through the broken window.</t3465>
<t3466>The room seems to be filled with particles swirling in the draft coming through the window, and the lights are emitting a blue and dim glow.</t3466> <t3467>What am I going to do?</t3467> <t3468>God, protect me from the disaster that may befall me tonight!</t3468> <t3469>I will keep this paper on my chest so that they find it when they prepare to bury me.</t3469> <t3470>My dear mother is gone!</t3470> <t3471>Now it is my time to go as well.</t3471> <t3472>If I do not survive this night, farewell, my dear Arthur.</t3472> <t3473>God bless you, my dear, and may God help me!</t3473>
<t3474>XII</t3474>
<t3475>Dr. Seward's journal</t3475>
<t3476>September 18.</t3476> <t3477>- I immediately drove to Hillingham and arrived there early in the morning.</t3477> <t3478>Leaving my car at the garden gate, I walked alone down the tree-lined path to the house.</t3478> <t3479>I knocked on the door slowly and rang the bell as quietly as possible because I was afraid of disturbing Lucy or her mother and hoped to bring only one of the servants to the door.</t3479> <t3480>After a while, when I received no response, I knocked and rang the bell again; still no answer.</t3480> <t3481>At this hour - for it was ten o'clock - I cursed the laziness of the servants who might be in bed and thus knocked and rang the bell more impatiently once again, but still, there was no response.</t3481> <t3482>Until now, I had only blamed the servants, but now a great fear began to fill me.</t3482> <t3483>Was this abandonment a new link in the chain of bad news that was tightening around us?</t3483> <t3484>Was this house, to which I had indeed arrived too late, a house of death?</t3484> <t3485>I knew that being late by even a few minutes, or even seconds, could mean long hours of danger for Lucy if her condition had relapsed; I circled the house hoping to find any possible entrance by chance.</t3485>
<t3486>I couldn't find a way to get inside.</t3486> <t3487>All the doors and windows were closed and locked, and I turned back to the porch in bewilderment.</t3487> <t3488>As I went there, I heard the rapid sound of a horse's hooves being driven like a bullet.</t3488> <t3489>The sounds ended at the door, and a few seconds later, I encountered Van Helsing running towards the tree-lined road.</t3489> <t3490>When he saw me, he started speaking breathlessly:</t3490>
<t3491>“So it was you and you just arrived.</t3491> <t3492>How is that?</t3492> <t3493>Are we too late?</t3493> <t3494>Didn't you get my telegram?</t3494><t3495>”</t3495>
<t3496>I explained as quickly and clearly as I could that I had only received his telegram early this morning and had not wasted a single minute in coming here, but I couldn't make anyone at home hear me.</t3496> <t3497>He paused and, while taking off his hat, said seriously:</t3497>
<t3498>“Then, I fear we are too late.</t3498> <t3499>God's will be done!”</t3499> <t3500>He continued with his usual healing energy: “Come.</t3500> <t3501>If there is no open way for us to enter, then we must make one.</t3501> <t3502>Time is now everything for us.”</t3502> <t3503>We circled around to the back of the house where the kitchen window was located.</t3503> <t3504>The professor took a small surgical saw from his bag and handed it to me, pointing at the iron bars guarding the window.</t3504> <t3505>I immediately set to work and soon cut through three of them.</t3505> <t3506>Then, with a long, thin knife, we pushed back the latches of the window sashes and opened the window.</t3506> <t3507>I helped the professor inside and followed him.</t3507> <t3508>There was no one in the kitchen or the nearby servant rooms.</t3508> <t3509>As we advanced, we checked all the rooms and found four maidservants lying on the floor in the dining room, dimly lit by the light filtering through the shutters.</t3509> <t3510>There was no reason to think they were dead, as their wheezing breaths and the bitter opium smell in the room left no doubt about their condition.</t3510> <t3511>Van Helsing and I looked at each other, and as we walked, he said, “We can deal with them later.”</t3511> <t3512>Then, we went up to Lucy’s room.</t3512> <t3513>We paused at the door for a second or two to listen inside, but there was no sound to be heard.</t3513> <t3514>With pale faces and trembling hands, we slowly opened the door and entered the room.</t3514>
<t3515>How can I describe what we saw?</t3515> <t3516>Two women, Lucy and her mother, were lying in the bed.</t3516> <t3517>Her mother was lying further away, covered with a white sheet that had been blown open by the wind coming through the broken window, revealing her pale, terrified face.</t3517> <t3518>Next to her lay Lucy, with an even paler face and a more forlorn appearance.</t3518> <t3519>We found the flowers that had previously been on her neck on her mother's chest, and her throat was bare, revealing the two small wounds we had noticed earlier, but it looked terrifyingly white and crushed.</t3519> <t3520>The professor, without saying a word, bent over the bed with his head almost touching Lucy's chest; then, like someone who had been listening, he quickly turned his head and sprang to his feet, shouting at me:</t3520>
<t3521>“It’s not too late yet!</t3521> <t3522>Quick! Quick! Bring the brandy!</t3522><t3523>”</t3523>
<t3524>I ran downstairs and returned with the brandy; I did not neglect to smell and taste it to understand whether it was drugged like the sherry decanter I found on the table.</t3524> <t3525>The servants were still breathing, but their breathing had become more troubled, and I thought the effect of the narcotic was beginning to wear off.</t3525> <t3526>Instead of staying there to be sure, I returned to Van Helsing.</t3526> <t3527>As he had done on another occasion, he applied brandy to Lucy's lips, gums, wrists, and palms.</t3527> <t3528>He said to me:</t3528>
<t3529>“I can do this, for now, this is the only thing we can do.</t3529> <t3530>You go and wake up those servants.</t3530> <t3531>Hit their faces with a wet towel; hit hard.</t3531> <t3532>Make sure they light a fire and prepare a hot bath.</t3532> <t3533>This poor thing is almost as cold as the woman beside her.</t3533> <t3534>She needs to be warmed up first before we can do anything else.</t3534><t3535>”</t3535>
<t3536>I went immediately and had no difficulty waking up three of the women.</t3536> <t3537>The fourth was a young girl, and it was clear that the drug had affected her more strongly, so I carried her to the couch and let her sleep.</t3537> <t3538>The others were a bit dazed at first, but once their memories returned, they screamed and cried hysterically.</t3538> <t3539>But I was firm with them and did not allow them to speak.</t3539> <t3540>I told them that losing one life was bad enough, and if they delayed, they would sacrifice Miss Lucy.</t3540> <t3541>Thus, sobbing and half-dressed, they set to work and prepared the fire and water.</t3541> <t3542>Fortunately, the kitchen and the boiler fire were still burning, and there was no shortage of hot water.</t3542> <t3543>We prepared the bath and carried Lucy as she was, placing her in the tub.</t3543> <t3544>While we were busy warming her arms and legs, the hall door was knocked.</t3544> <t3545>One of the servants ran, hurriedly put on some more clothes, and opened the door.</t3545> <t3546>She came back and whispered that a young gentleman had arrived with a message from Mr. Holmwood.</t3546> <t3547>I asked her to tell the man he had to wait, as we could not see anyone at the moment.</t3547> <t3548>She left with this message, and I focused on our work, completely forgetting about the man.</t3548>
<t3549>I had never seen the professor working so tirelessly in my life.</t3549> <t3550>Like him, I knew we were fighting against death, and I told him this when we took a break.</t3550> <t3551>He responded in a way I didn't understand, with the most serious expression his face could take on:</t3551>
<t3552>“If it were just like that, I would stay where we are now and let it fade away in peace, because I see no light of life on the horizon.”</t3552> <t3553>He continued his work - if such a thing is possible - with renewed and more enthusiastic strength.</t3553>
<t3554>A little later, we both noticed that the heat was starting to work a bit.</t3554> <t3555>Lucy’s heart was beating a little more audibly in the stethoscope, and there was tangible movement in her lungs.</t3555> <t3556>Van Helsing’s face was almost glowing, and as he wrapped Lucy in a warm blanket to dry her off after taking her out of the bath, he said to me:</t3556>
<t3557>"The first round is ours! Check!"</t3557>
<t3558>We took Lucy to the other room that had been prepared until then and laid her on the bed, forcing a few drops of brandy down her throat.</t3558> <t3559>I noticed that Van Helsing had wrapped a soft, silk handkerchief around Lucy's neck.</t3559> <t3560>Lucy was still not conscious and, if not worse, she was as bad as she had been when we saw her a little while ago.</t3560>
<t3561>Van Helsing called one of the women and told her to stay by Lucy's side and not to take her eyes off her until we returned, and then with a gesture, he led me outside.</t3561>
<t3562>While descending the stairs, "We should exchange ideas about what needs to be done."</t3562> <t3563>In the hallway, he opened the dining room door and as he carefully closed the door behind him, we entered.</t3563> <t3564>The shutters were open, but the curtains had already been drawn in accordance with the mourning etiquette that lower-class English women always strictly adhered to.</t3564> <t3565>Therefore, the room was dim.</t3565> <t3566>Nevertheless, it was bright enough for our purposes.</t3566> <t3567>Van Helsing's sternness had diminished due to a kind of bewilderment.</t3567> <t3568>It was clear that something was tormenting his mind, so I waited a bit; then he began to speak:</t3568>
<t3569>“What should we do now?</t3569> <t3570>Where should we look for help?</t3570> <t3571>We need to perform another blood transfusion, and it must be soon, or that poor girl won't last an hour.</t3571> <t3572>You are already exhausted; I am exhausted too.</t3572> <t3573>Even if they had the courage to accept, I am afraid to trust those women.</t3573> <t3574>What should we do to find someone to open their veins for her?</t3574><t3575>”</t3575>
<t3576>"What's wrong with me?"</t3576><t3577>"</t3577>
<t3578>The sound had come from the couch across the room, and the tone of the voice brought relief and joy to my heart because the voice belonged to Quincey Morris.</t3578> <t3579>When Van Helsing first heard the voice, he jumped up angrily, but then his face softened, and as I shouted "Quincey Morris!" and ran towards him with outstretched hands, a pleased expression came to his eyes.</t3579>
<t3580>"What wind blew you here?" I asked as our hands joined.</t3580>
<t3581>“I think so, Art.</t3581><t3582>”</t3582>
<t3583>He handed me a telegram:</t3583>
<t3584>I haven't heard from Seward for three days and I am very worried.</t3584> <t3585>I cannot leave here.</t3585> <t3586>My father is still in the same condition.</t3586> <t3587>Tell me how Lucy is.</t3587> <t3588>Don't delay.</t3588> <t3589>- HOLMWOOD.</t3589>
<t3590>“I guess I arrived just in time.</t3590> <t3591>Just tell me what I need to do, you know.</t3591><t3592>”</t3592>
<t3593>Van Helsing strode forward and took her hand, looking directly into her eyes, and said:</t3593>
<t3594>“When a woman is in trouble, the blood of a brave man is the best thing in this world.</t3594> <t3595>You are a man, there is no doubt about it.</t3595> <t3596>Yes, the devil may be working against us with all his might, but God sends us a man whenever we need one.</t3596><t3597>”</t3597>
<t3598>We performed that dreadful procedure again.</t3598> <t3599>I don't have the heart to go into the details.</t3599> <t3600>Lucy had suffered a tremendous shock, and its effect on her was greater than ever because, despite the large amount of blood going into her veins, her body was not responding to the treatment as well as it had before.</t3600> <t3601>The struggle she put up to return to life was a terrifying thing to see and hear.</t3601> <t3602>But both her heart and lungs began to function better, and Van Helsing, as before, injected morphine subcutaneously; this again proved very effective.</t3602> <t3603>The state of unconsciousness gave way to a light sleep.</t3603> <t3604>While I went downstairs with Quincey Morris to send one of the servants to pay the waiting coachmen and send them away, Van Helsing kept vigil at Lucy's side.</t3604> <t3605>After having a glass of wine, I left Quincey, who had lain down, and told the cook to prepare a good breakfast.</t3605> <t3606>Then an idea came to me, and I went to the room where Lucy was now.</t3606> <t3607>When I entered quietly, I found Van Helsing with a couple of sheets of paper in his hand.</t3607> <t3608>It was clear that he had read them and was contemplating them, with his hand on his forehead.</t3608> <t3609>There was an expression of unpleasant satisfaction on his face, typical of someone who has resolved a doubt.</t3609> <t3610>As he handed me the paper, he simply said: "It fell from Lucy's chest as we were carrying her to the bath.</t3610><t3611>"</t3611>
<t3612>After reading it, I stopped and looked at the Professor, and after waiting a bit, I asked: "For God's sake, what does all this mean?"</t3612> <t3613>Was he mad or is he mad?</t3613> <t3614>Or what kind of terrible danger is this?" I was so bewildered that I didn't know what to say.</t3614> <t3615>Van Helsing reached out his hand and said as he took the paper:</t3615>
<t3616>“Now, don't worry about this.</t3616> <t3617>Forget about it for now.</t3617> <t3618>When the time comes, you will learn and understand everything; but later.</t3618> <t3619>So, what did you come to tell me now?”</t3619> <t3620>This brought me back to reality and I regained my composure.</t3620>
<t3621>“I came to talk about the death certificate.</t3621> <t3622>If we do not act properly and wisely, an investigation may be opened and this document may need to be presented.</t3622> <t3623>I hope there will be no need for an investigation, because if there is, if nothing else, it will certainly cause poor Lucy’s death.</t3623> <t3624>I know, you know, and the doctor who is taking care of her knows that Ms. Westenra has a heart condition; we can confirm that she died from this illness.</t3624> <t3625>Come, let’s fill out this document immediately; I will take it to the registrar and then proceed to the person who will handle the funeral.”</t3625> <t3626>“Good, oh my friend John! You have thought well!</t3626> <t3627>Even though Miss Lucy is saddened by the enemies surrounding her, at least she is happy with the friends who love her.</t3627> <t3628>One, two, three, all of them, and also the old man are opening their veins for her.</t3628> <t3629>Oh yes, I know, my friend John; I am not blind!</t3629> <t3630>I love you even more for this!</t3630> <t3631>Now go.</t3631><t3632>”</t3632>
<t3633>As I was holding the telegram that informed Arthur that Ms. Westenra had died, Lucy was ill but was getting better, and that Van Helsing and I were by her side, I encountered Quincey Morris.</t3633> <t3634>I told him where I was going, and he hurriedly saw me off, but just as I was leaving, he said:</t3634>
<t3635>"Jack, when you get back, can I have a word with you in private?"</t3635> <t3636>I nodded and said yes, then left.</t3636> <t3637>I didn't encounter any difficulties with the registration, and I arranged for the person responsible for the funeral to come in the evening to take measurements for the coffin and make the necessary arrangements.</t3637>
<t3638>When I returned, Quincey was waiting for me.</t3638> <t3639>I told him that I would see him as soon as I got information about Lucy and went up to Lucy's room.</t3639> <t3640>She was still sleeping, and the Professor, apparently, had not moved from the chair beside her bed.</t3640> <t3641>From his gesture of putting his finger to his lips, I concluded that he expected Lucy to wake up soon and was afraid of interfering with the natural course of events.</t3641> <t3642>Therefore, I went down to Quincey and took him to the breakfast room, which was a bit more cheerful—or less cheerless—compared to the other rooms, as the curtains were not closed.</t3642> <t3643>When we were alone, he said:</t3643>
<t3644>“Jack Seward, I don't want to intrude where I have no right to be; but this is not an ordinary situation.</t3644> <t3645>You know that I once loved that girl and wanted to marry her; but even though all that is in the past, I can't help but worry about her.</t3645> <t3646>What is her problem?</t3646> <t3647>The Dutchman -and I can see he is a good man- said when you entered the room that you needed to perform another blood transfusion and that both you and he were exhausted.</t3647> <t3648>I know that you medical men have private conversations among yourselves and that an ordinary person should not expect to learn about the matters you discuss among yourselves.</t3648> <t3649>But this is not an ordinary situation and whatever it is, I have done my part.</t3649> <t3650>Isn't that so?</t3650><t3651>”</t3651>
<t3652>“Yes, that's right,” I said; and he continued his words:</t3652>
<t3653>“I believe that both you and Van Helsing have already done what I did today.</t3653> <t3654>Isn't that so?</t3654><t3655>”</t3655>
<t3656>“Yes, that's right.</t3656><t3657>”</t3657>
<t3658>“And I think Art is involved too.</t3658> <t3659>When I saw him at his own house four days ago, he looked strange.</t3659> <t3660>I hadn't seen anything deteriorate so quickly since a mare I loved in the South American plains died overnight.</t3660> <t3661>One of those big bats they call vampires had latched onto her at night and after gorging itself, left her vein open, and because she didn't have enough blood left to keep her standing, I had to shoot her while she lay down.</t3661> <t3662>Jack, I don't want you to betray any trust, but Arthur was the first, wasn't he?”</t3662> <t3663>As he spoke, my poor friend was extremely anxious.</t3663> <t3664>He was tormented by suspicion about the woman he loved, and his pain was intensified by knowing nothing about the terrible mystery surrounding her.</t3664> <t3665>His heart was bleeding, and it took all his manliness—and he had a kingly amount of it—to keep from completely losing himself.</t3665> <t3666>I paused before answering, because I felt I shouldn't reveal anything the Professor wanted kept secret; but he already knew and guessed so much that there was no reason not to answer, so I replied in the same way: “Yes, he was.</t3666><t3667>”</t3667>
<t3668>“And how long has this been going on?</t3668><t3669>”</t3669>
<t3670>“About ten days.</t3670><t3671>”</t3671>
<t3672>“Ten days! Then, Jack, I believe that within this period, that poor beautiful creature we all love has taken the blood of four strong men into her veins.</t3672> <t3673>Her entire body couldn't carry that much blood.”</t3673> <t3674>Then, approaching me and half-whispering harshly, he said: “What draws the blood?</t3674><t3675>”</t3675>
<t3676>I shook my head to indicate I didn't know.</t3676> <t3677>"That's it," I said, "that's the problem.</t3677> <t3678>Van Helsing is very excited about this and I don't know what to do.</t3678> <t3679>I don't even dare to make a guess.</t3679> <t3680>A series of small events have occurred that have thrown all our plans for properly monitoring Lucy out the window.</t3680> <t3681>But these won't happen again.</t3681> <t3682>We will stay here until everything is fixed - or broken.</t3682> <t3683>Quincey extended his hand.</t3683> <t3684>"Count me in," he said.</t3684> <t3685>"You and the Dutchman will tell me what to do, and I will do it.</t3685><t3686>"</t3686>
<t3687>When she woke up late that afternoon, the first thing Lucy did was to feel her chest and, to my surprise, take out the paper that Van Helsing had given me to read from her chest.</t3687><t3688>The careful Professor had put it back where it came from so she wouldn't worry when she woke up.</t3688><t3689>Then, her eyes shifted to Van Helsing and me, and she felt relieved.</t3689><t3690>Then, she looked around the room and shuddered when she realized where she was; she screamed loudly and covered her pale face with her poor, thin hands.</t3690><t3691>We both understood what this meant - that she fully comprehended her mother's death; so we did our best to comfort her.</t3691><t3692>Undoubtedly, the empathy comforted her a bit, but she was very weak mentally and spiritually; she cried silently and feebly for a long time.</t3692><t3693>We told her that one or both of us would always stay with her; this seemed to comfort her a little.</t3693><t3694>She fell into a light sleep towards twilight.</t3694><t3695>During this time, a very strange thing happened.</t3695><t3696>In her sleep, she took the paper out of her chest and tore it up.</t3696><t3697>Van Helsing went to her and took the pieces of paper from her hand.</t3697><t3698>However, despite this, Lucy continued the tearing motion as if the paper was still in her hand; finally, she raised her hands and opened them as if scattering the pieces.</t3698><t3699>Van Helsing seemed surprised, and his eyebrows furrowed as if deep in thought, but he said nothing.</t3699>
<t3700>September 19.</t3700> <t3701>- Throughout last night, he slept fitfully, always fearing sleep and growing somehow weaker with each awakening.</t3701> <t3702>The Professor and I took turns watching over him, never leaving him alone for a moment.</t3702> <t3703>Quincey Morris said nothing about his plan, but I knew he patrolled around the house all night long.</t3703>
<t3704>When it was daytime, the sunlight revealed how badly his poor strength had been damaged.</t3704> <t3705>He could barely turn his head, and the small amount of food he could consume didn't seem to benefit him.</t3705> <t3706>He slept from time to time, and Van Helsing and I could see the difference between when he was asleep and awake.</t3706> <t3707>While he appeared weaker and his breathing was lighter when sleeping, he seemed stronger; his open mouth revealed his drawn, pale gums, making his teeth look definitely longer and sharper; when he woke up, the softness in his eyes clearly changed his expression, because even though he was dying, he looked like himself.</t3707> <t3708>In the afternoon, he asked for Arthur and sent him a telegram.</t3708> <t3709>Quincey went to the station to meet him.</t3709>
<t3710>When Arthur arrived, it was almost six o'clock; the sun was setting, red light was streaming in through the window, giving a bit more color to his pale cheeks.</t3710> <t3711>When he saw him, Arthur was almost choked with excitement, none of us could speak.</t3711> <t3712>In the hours that passed, healthy sleeps or what were considered coma-like states became more frequent, and thus the intervals where conversation was possible shortened.</t3712> <t3713>But Arthur's presence acted as a stimulant; Lucy had somewhat come to herself and was more lively while talking to him than she had been since we arrived here.</t3713> <t3714>Arthur had also pulled himself together, speaking as cheerfully as possible, so everything was going as well as it could.</t3714>
<t3715>It was almost one o'clock and Arthur and Van Helsing were sitting beside Lucy.</t3715> <t3716>In fifteen minutes, I will take over their watch, and I am making this record on Lucy's phonograph.</t3716> <t3717>They will try to rest until six o'clock.</t3717> <t3718>I fear tomorrow will end our watch, for this shock was too great; the poor child will not recover.</t3718> <t3719>God help us all.</t3719>
<t3720>Letter from Mina Harker to Lucy Westenra (Unopened by the recipient.</t3720><t3721>)</t3721>
<t3722>September 17</t3722>
<t3723>Dearest Lucy</t3723>
<t3724>It feels like a century has passed since I last heard from you or actually wrote to you.</t3724> <t3725>I know you will forgive me for my mistakes once you read all my news.</t3725> <t3726>Well, I safely received my husband; when we arrived in Exeter, a car was waiting for us, and despite suffering from gout, Mr. Hawkins was in the car.</t3726> <t3727>He took us to his home, where all the rooms allocated to us were very nice and comfortable, and we had dinner together.</t3727> <t3728>After dinner, Mr. Hawkins said:</t3728>
<t3729>“My dears, I want to drink to your health and happiness; I wish all the best for you.</t3729> <t3730>I have known both of you since your childhood and watched you grow with love and pride.</t3730> <t3731>Now I want you to build your home here beside me.</t3731> <t3732>I have neither wife nor child left; they are all gone and I have left everything to you in my will."</t3732> <t3733>As Jonathan and the old man shook hands, I cried, my dear Lucy.</t3733> <t3734>Our evening was very, very, very happy.</t3734>
<t3735>So here we are, settled in this beautiful old house, and from both my bedroom and the living room, I can see the nearby cathedral, with the great black bodies of the elm trees standing against the old yellow stones of the cathedral; I can hear the crows making noise all day, cawing and gossiping about the behaviors of crows and people.</t3735> <t3736>Needless to say, I am busy making arrangements concerning work and household management.</t3736> <t3737>Jonathan and Mr. Hawkins work all day long; because Jonathan is now a partner.</t3737> <t3738>Mr. Hawkins wants to tell him everything about the clients.</t3738>
<t3739>How is your dear mother doing?</t3739> <t3740>I wish I could come to town for a day or two to see you, dear, but with so much burden on my shoulders, I still don't have the courage; Jonathan still needs care as well.</t3740> <t3741>A bit of flesh has started to cover his bones, but he was terribly weakened by the long illness; even now, sometimes he suddenly jumps up in his sleep and wakes up trembling until I can soothe him back to his usual docility with sweet words.</t3741> <t3742>Still, thank God, these episodes are becoming less frequent as days go by, and I believe they will completely disappear in time.</t3742> <t3743>So, I've given you my news, let me ask about yours.</t3743> <t3744>When and where will you get married, who will conduct the wedding, and what will you wear, will it be an open wedding for the guests or will it be just among yourselves?</t3744> <t3745>Tell me everything, dear; tell me everything about it because there is nothing that concerns you that is not important to me.</t3745> <t3746>Jonathan asked me to convey his "deepest respects" to you, but I don't think that's enough for a greeting from the junior partner of Hawkins & Harker; so, since you love me, and he loves me, and I love you in all tenses and meanings of the word, I am sending you his "love" instead.</t3746> <t3747>Goodbye dear Lucy, and may all goodness be upon you.</t3747>
<t3748>With my love,</t3748>

<t3761>M.</t3761> <t3762>D. and the report</t3762>
<t3763>September 20</t3763>
<t3764>Dear Sir,</t3764>
<t3765>In line with your requests, I am sending the report regarding the items left under my responsibility as an attachment.</t3765> <t3766>There are more things to be said about the patient, Renfield.</t3766> <t3767>He had another fit that could have had a terrible ending, but fortunately, it did not.</t3767> <t3768>This afternoon, a transport cart with two men on it arrived at the empty house adjacent to our property - you remember, the house the patient escaped to twice.</t3768> <t3769>Since the men were strangers to the area, they stopped at our door to ask the porter for directions.</t3769> <t3770>I was looking out the window of my study while smoking my cigarette after dinner and saw one of the men approaching the house.</t3770> <t3771>As he passed in front of Renfield's room window, the patient began to scold him from inside and shouted all kinds of obscenities at him.</t3771> <t3772>The man, who seemed quite gentlemanly, simply replied, "Shut up, you foul-mouthed beggar," upon which our man accused him of robbing and killing him and said he would stop him even if he were to be hanged for it.</t3772> <t3773>I opened the window and signaled to the man not to mind, so he, after taking a look around and deciding what kind of place he had come to, simply said, "God bless you, sir, I don't care what is said to me in a damn madhouse.</t3773> <t3774>I pity you and the director for having to live in this house with such a wild animal," and then politely asked for directions; I told him where the door of the empty house was; he walked away with our man's threats, curses, and swearing trailing behind him.</t3774> <t3775>Wondering if I could understand why he got so angry, I went downstairs, because he is usually very well-mannered and nothing like this had ever happened outside of his wild fits.</t3775> <t3776>To my great surprise, I found him quite calm and moderate in his demeanor.</t3776> <t3777>I tried to get him to talk about the incident, but he kept sweetly asking what I meant and made me think he was completely unaware of the matter.</t3777> <t3778>Regrettably, I must report that this was just another display of his devilishness, because half an hour later, I received another report about him.</t3778> <t3779>This time, he had climbed out of his room window and was running down the tree-lined path.</t3779> <t3780>I told the attendants to follow me and ran after the patient because I was afraid he might harm someone.</t3780> <t3781>My fear was justified when I saw the cart that had passed by earlier moving down the road with several large wooden crates on it.</t3781> <t3782>The men were wiping their foreheads as if they had been exercising vigorously, and their faces were flushed.</t3782> <t3783>Before I could reach him, the patient lunged at the men, pulled one of them off the cart, and started banging his head on the ground.</t3783> <t3784>If I hadn't caught him in time, I think he would have killed the man right there.</t3784> <t3785>The other man jumped down and hit the patient on the head with the blunt end of his whip.</t3785> <t3786>It was a terrible blow, but he didn't seem to care and fought with all three of us, pulling us back and forth as if we were kittens.</t3786> <t3787>You know, I am not light, and the other two were hefty men as well.</t3787> <t3788>At first, he was silent while fighting; but when we started to subdue him and the attendants put a straitjacket on him, he began to shout: "I will stop them!</t3788> <t3789>They will not rob me!</t3789> <t3790>They will not slowly kill me!</t3790> <t3791>I will fight for my master!" He said this and other such nonsensical things.</t3791> <t3792>With considerable difficulty, they took him back to the house and put him in the padded room.</t3792> <t3793>One of the attendants, Hardy, had a broken finger.</t3793> <t3794>But I have sorted everything out, and he is now in good condition.</t3794>
<t3796>The two carriers initially shouted their threats regarding the legal measures to be taken for the damage caused, saying they would rain down all the punishments the law could give upon us.</t3796> <t3797>But their threats were intertwined with an indirect defense relating to both of them being defeated by a feeble madman.</t3797> <t3798>They said they could have dealt with the man quickly if their strength hadn't been spent carrying the heavy chests and lifting them onto the cart.</t3798> <t3799>As another reason for their defeat, they cited the unusual thirst they had fallen into due to the dusty nature of their profession and the deplorable distance of their work from any place of amusement.</t3799> <t3800>I understood their purpose very well; after one or more glasses of rum and a gold coin placed in each of their hands, they began to disregard the attack and swore they would encounter a worse madman to have the pleasure of meeting such a "damn good fellow" who writes these lines to you.</t3800> <t3801>I took their names and addresses in case it might be necessary in the future.</t3801> <t3802>The information is as follows: Jack Smollet from Dudding Houses, King George Road, Great Walworth, and Thomas Snelling from Peter Parley Houses, Guide Square, Bethnal Green.</t3802> <t3803>Both work at Harris & Sons Transport and Haulage Company located at Orange Master's Yard, Soho.</t3803>
<t3804>I will write to you about every topic that occurs here and might attract interest, and if something important happens, I will send a telegram as soon as possible.</t3804>
<t3805>Believe me, Sir.</t3805>
<t3806>Yours sincerely,</t3806>
<t3807>PATRICK HENNESSEY</t3807>
<t3808>Letter from Mina Harker to Lucy Westenra (Unopened by recipient.</t3808><t3809>)</t3809>
<t3810>September 18</t3810>
<t3811>Dearest Lucy</t3811>
<t3812>We experienced such a great disaster! Mr. Hawkins died suddenly.</t3812> <t3813>Some might think that this is not very sad for us, but we both loved him so much that it truly feels like we have lost our father.</t3813> <t3814>Since I never knew my mother or father, the death of this dear old man was a great shock to me.</t3814> <t3815>Jonathan is quite distressed.</t3815> <t3816>Not only does he feel great sorrow for this good man who had been his companion throughout his life and finally treated him like his own son, leaving him a fortune beyond our humble means, but Jonathan is also troubled by something else.</t3816> <t3817>He says that the amount of responsibility placed upon him with this situation makes him uneasy.</t3817> <t3818>He is starting to doubt himself.</t3818> <t3819>I try to cheer him up, and my faith in him helps him believe in himself.</t3819> <t3820>But this heavy shock he has experienced affects him the most in this matter.</t3820> <t3821>Oh, it is so hard that such a sweet, simple, noble, strong nature - a nature that, with the help of our dear, good friend, elevated him from a legal consultant to mastery within a few years - has been wounded in a way that destroys the essence of its strength.</t3821> <t3822>If I am troubling you with my worries in the midst of your own happiness, forgive me, dear; but dear Lucy, I must tell someone because trying to appear brave and cheerful in front of Jonathan is exhausting me, and there is no one here with whom I can share my secret.</t3822> <t3823>We have to go to London tomorrow, but I am hesitant about it; Mr. Hawkins stated in his will that he wanted to be buried in the same grave as his father.</t3823> <t3824>Since he has no other relatives, Jonathan has to take on the role of the funeral owner.</t3824> <t3825>Even if just for a minute or two, I will come to see you, dear.</t3825> <t3826>Forgive me for troubling you.</t3826> <t3827>With all my best wishes.</t3827>
<t3828>The one who loves you</t3828>
<t3829>MINA HARKER</t3829>
<t3830>Dr. Seward's journal</t3830>
<t3831>September 20 - Only determination and habit can allow me to make a note here tonight.</t3831> <t3832>I am in such a pitiable state, so sad, so tired of the world and everything in it, including life itself, that if I were to hear the flutter of the angel of death's wings right now, I wouldn't care.</t3832> <t3833>And recently, those merciless wings have been flapping for a certain purpose - Lucy's mother, Arthur's father, and now...</t3833> <t3834>Let me get back to my work.</t3834>
<t3835>I took over the duty of keeping watch over Lucy from Van Helsing just in time.</t3835><t3836>We also wanted Arthur to go and rest, but he initially refused.</t3836><t3837>However, when I told him that we would need his help during the day and that we shouldn't be exhausted from lack of rest if Lucy's condition worsened, he agreed to go.</t3837><t3838>Van Helsing was very kind to him.</t3838><t3839>"Come, my child," he said; "come with me.</t3839><t3840>You are sick and weak, and in addition to the burden we know of, you have also experienced great sorrow and mental anguish.</t3840><t3841>You should not be alone; for to be alone is to be filled with fear and dread.</t3841><t3842>Come to the sitting room where there is a large fire burning and two couches.</t3842><t3843>You lie on one, I on the other, and even if we do not talk or even sleep, our companionship will comfort each other." Arthur, looking longingly at Lucy's face, which was almost whiter than the linen on her pillow, left the room with the Professor.</t3843><t3844>Lucy was lying quite still, and I looked around the room to see that everything was as it should be.</t3844><t3845>I could see that the Professor maintained his determination to use garlic in this room as well as in the other; all the window frames smelled of garlic, and around Lucy's neck, over the silk handkerchief that Van Helsing wanted her to wear, there was a rough garland made of the same scented flowers.</t3845><t3846>Lucy's breathing was a bit raspy, and her face was in a terrible state because her pale gums were exposed through her open mouth.</t3846><t3847>In the dim and uncertain light, her teeth seemed longer and sharper than they had in the morning.</t3847><t3848>Especially, by some trick of the light, her canine teeth appeared longer and sharper than the others.</t3848><t3849>I sat down beside her, and she immediately moved restlessly.</t3849><t3850>At that very moment, monotonous wing sounds were heard at the window.</t3850><t3851>I slowly went to the window and looked outside from the corner of the curtain.</t3851><t3852>There was a full moon, and I could see that the noise was being made by a large bat, which, though very dim, was undoubtedly attracted by the light and occasionally struck the window with its wings.</t3852><t3853>When I returned to my seat, I noticed that Lucy had slightly moved and had torn off the garlic flowers from her throat.</t3853><t3854>I placed them back as best as I could and sat down to watch her.</t3854>
<t3855>She woke up a little later and I gave her the meal prescribed by Van Helsing.</t3855> <t3856>She ate very little and was reluctant.</t3856> <t3857>There seemed to be no sign of the struggle for life and strength that had been indicative of her illness until now.</t3857> <t3858>It struck me as odd that as soon as she regained consciousness, she pressed the garlic flowers to her chest.</t3858> <t3859>It was certainly strange that whenever she fell into that state of sleep with labored breathing, she pushed the flowers away, but when she woke up, she clung to them tightly.</t3859> <t3860>There was no possibility of making a mistake in this matter, because she went through many periods of sleep and wakefulness over the long hours that followed, and she repeated these two actions many times.</t3860>
<t3861>At six o'clock, Van Helsing came to take over the watch from me.</t3861> <t3862>During this time, Arthur had fallen asleep, and the Professor, out of compassion, had allowed him to continue sleeping.</t3862> <t3863>When he saw Lucy's face, I could hear the hiss in his breathing, and he said harshly in a whisper: "Open the curtain; I want light!" Then he leaned in and examined her carefully, his face almost touching Lucy's.</t3863> <t3864>He removed the flowers and the silk handkerchief from her neck.</t3864> <t3865>As he did so, he flinched, and I heard him say, as if choking, "Mein Gott!"</t3865> <t3866>I also leaned in and felt a strange shiver when I saw what had startled Van Helsing.</t3866> <t3867>The wounds on Lucy's neck had completely disappeared.</t3867> <t3868>For a full five minutes, Van Helsing stood there, looking at Lucy with the sternest expression on his face.</t3868> <t3869>Then he turned to me and said calmly:</t3869>
<t3870>“He is dying.</t3870> <t3871>It won't take long now.</t3871> <t3872>Be careful; whether he dies while conscious or in his sleep will change many things.</t3872> <t3873>Wake that poor child up, let him come and see him one last time; he trusts us and we promised him.</t3873><t3874>”</t3874>
<t3875>I went to the dining room and woke Arthur up.</t3875> <t3876>For a moment he was dazed, but when he saw the daylight streaming through the edges of the shutters, he thought he was late and expressed his fear.</t3876> <t3877>I convinced him that Lucy was still asleep, but as gently as I could, I told him that both Van Helsing and I feared the end was near.</t3877> <t3878>He covered his face with his hands and fell to his knees at the foot of the couch; there he remained for perhaps a minute, praying with his head bowed and his shoulders shaking with sorrow.</t3878> <t3879>I took his hand and lifted him up.</t3879> <t3880>"Come," I said, "my dear old friend, gather all your courage; this will be the best and easiest for her.</t3880><t3881>"</t3881>
<t3882>When we came to Lucy's room, I could see that Van Helsing, with his usual prudence, had fixed everything and made it as pleasant as possible.</t3882> <t3883>He had even brushed Lucy's hair, so that it lay on her pillow in its usual sunny waves.</t3883> <t3884>When we entered the room, she opened her eyes and, upon seeing him, slowly whispered:</t3884>
<t3885>“Arthur! Ah, my love.</t3885> <t3886>I am so happy you came!” He was just about to lean in to kiss Lucy when Van Helsing pulled him back.</t3886> <t3887>“No,” he whispered, “not yet!</t3887> <t3888>Hold her hand; this will comfort her more.</t3888><t3889>”</t3889>
<t3890>Thus, Arthur held her hand and knelt beside her; Lucy looked more beautiful than ever with the soft lines that matched the angelic beauty of her eyes.</t3890> <t3891>Then her eyes slowly closed and she fell asleep.</t3891> <t3892>For a short while, her chest rose and fell gently, her breathing like that of a tired child.</t3892>
<t3893>And then, in a vague manner, the strange change I noticed at night occurred.</t3893> <t3894>His breathing began to take on a wheezing quality, his mouth opened, and his receded pale gums made his teeth appear longer and sharper than ever.</t3894> <t3895>As if waking from sleep, vaguely, unconsciously, he opened his eyes that suddenly became dull and rigid, and in a soft, sensual voice I had never heard from his lips before, he said:</t3895>
<t3896>“Arthur! Ah, my darling.</t3896> <t3897>I am so happy that you came!</t3897> <t3898>Kiss me!” Arthur eagerly leaned in to kiss her, but at that very moment, Van Helsing, who was startled by Lucy’s voice just like I was, pounced on Arthur and grabbed him by the neck with a strength I never thought he possessed, pulling him back - or rather, almost throwing him to the other side of the room.</t3898>
<t3899>"Not in a million years!" he said, "not for your living soul or his!" And he stood between them like a tiger.</t3899>
<t3900>Arthur was so stunned that for a moment he didn't know what to do or say; before any impulse of violence could take hold of him, he perceived the place and situation, and remained silent, waiting.</t3900>
<t3901>My eyes, just like Van Helsing's, were fixed on Lucy; like a shadow, we saw an angry spasm pass over her face; her sharp teeth clashed together.</t3901> <t3902>Then, her eyes closed and she took a deep breath.</t3902>
<t3903>Shortly after, with all her tenderness, she opened her eyes and reached out her own poor, pale, thin hand to take Van Helsing's large, brown hand; pulling it towards her and kissed it.</t3903> <t3904>“My true friend,” she said, with a voice so weak and a tenderness beyond words, “the true friend of me and Arthur!</t3904> <t3905>Oh, protect him and bring me peace!</t3905><t3906>”</t3906>
<t3907>Van Helsing said solemnly, "I promise!" while raising his hand like someone taking an oath, kneeling beside Lucy.</t3907> <t3908>Then he turned to Arthur and said to him, "Come, my son, take her hand in yours and kiss her on the forehead, just once.</t3908><t3909>"</t3909>
<t3910>Their eyes met instead of their lips, and thus they parted.</t3910>
<t3911>Lucy’s eyes closed; Van Helsing, who was watching them closely, took Arthur’s arm and moved him away.</t3911>
<t3912>And then, Lucy's breathing became raspy again and suddenly stopped.</t3912>
<t3913>“Everything is over,” said Van Helsing.</t3913> <t3914>“She is dead!</t3914><t3915>”</t3915>
<t3916>I grabbed Arthur by the arm and took him to the living room, where he sat down and, upon seeing it, almost broke my heart as he covered his face with his hands, sobbing uncontrollably.</t3916>
<t3917>I returned to the room; I found Van Helsing looking at poor Lucy, the Professor's face was more stern than ever.</t3917> <t3918>There had been some changes in Lucy's body.</t3918> <t3919>Death had given back some of her beauty, as her forehead and cheeks had regained some of their flowing lines; even her lips had lost their deathly pallor.</t3919> <t3920>It was as if the blood, no longer needed to keep her heart working, had gone there to make the cruelty of death as little harsh as possible.</t3920>
<t3921>We thought he was dying while sleeping,</t3921>
<t3922>And when he dies, he sleeps.</t3922> <t3923>33</t3923>
<t3924>I stood next to Van Helsing and said, "Ah, poor girl, finally at peace."</t3924> <t3925>"The end has come!"</t3925> <t3926>He turned to me and replied with grave seriousness, "No; alas, it is not so.</t3926> <t3927>This is only the beginning!" When I asked what he meant, he just shook his head and said:</t3927>
<t3928>“We can't do anything for now.</t3928> <t3929>Wait and see.</t3929><t3930>”</t3930>
<t3931>Thirteen</t3931>
<t3932>Dr. Seward's journal (continued)</t3932>
<t3933>The funeral was arranged for the day after tomorrow so that Lucy and her mother could be buried together.</t3933> <t3934>I dealt with all the horrible official paperwork, and the polite funeral director proved that his entire staff was either cursed or blessed with his own excessive courtesy.</t3934> <t3935>Even the woman who performed the final duties for the dead said to me in a secret and friendly professionalism as she left the mortuary:</t3935>
<t3936>“It has become a very beautiful corpse, sir.</t3936> <t3937>It is a great privilege to take care of it.</t3937> <t3938>It would not be an exaggeration to say that it will elevate our institution!</t3938><t3939>”</t3939>
<t3940>I noticed that Van Helsing never left the place.</t3940> <t3941>The disorder of the household made this possible.</t3941> <t3942>There were no relatives nearby; since Arthur had to return the next day to attend his father's funeral, we couldn't manage to inform anyone who needed to be called.</t3942> <t3943>Under these circumstances, Van Helsing and I took it upon ourselves to examine the documents and handle similar tasks.</t3943> <t3944>Van Helsing insisted on examining Lucy's documents himself.</t3944> <t3945>As a foreigner, I asked why, fearing that he might not be well-versed in English legal requirements and might inadvertently create some unnecessary problems.</t3945> <t3946>He replied: "I know; I know.</t3946> <t3947>You forget that I am a lawyer as well as a doctor.</t3947> <t3948>But this is not just for the law.</t3948> <t3949>You knew this when you avoided the medical examiner.</t3949> <t3950>I have more things to avoid than that.</t3950> <t3951>There might be other documents - like this one."</t3951> <t3952>As he spoke, he took out the paper found on Lucy's chest, which she had torn in her sleep, from his pocket notebook.</t3952> <t3953>"When you find something about who the legal advisor working for the late Ms. Westenra is, seal all her documents and write him a letter tonight.</t3953> <t3954>As for me, I will keep watch in this room and Miss Lucy's room all night and see what I can find.</t3954> <t3955>It's not good for all her thoughts to fall into the hands of strangers.</t3955><t3956>"</t3956>
<t3957>I continued to deal with the part of the work that fell to me, and after another half hour, I found the name and address of Ms. Westenra's legal advisor and wrote to him.</t3957> <t3958>All the documents of the poor lady were organized; clear and precise instructions regarding the place of burial were given.</t3958> <t3959>I had just sealed the letter when Van Helsing surprised me by entering the room and said:</t3959>
<t3960>"Can I help you, my friend John?</t3960> <t3961>I have no work and if you allow me, I am at your service.</t3961><t3962>"</t3962>
<t3963>"Did you find what you were looking for?" he asked, and then responded:</t3963>
<t3964>“I wasn't looking for anything specific.</t3964> <t3965>I was merely hoping to find what was there - and I did; just a few letters and some notepaper and a newly started diary.</t3965> <t3966>But they are here and for now, we shouldn't say anything about them.</t3966> <t3967>Tomorrow I will see the poor young man and with his approval, I will use some of these.</t3967><t3968>”</t3968>
<t3969>When we finished the work at hand, he continued speaking: "And now my friend John, I think we can go to bed.</t3969> <t3970>Both you and I need sleep and rest to recover.</t3970> <t3971>We have a lot of work to do tomorrow, and we don't need this for tonight.</t3971> <t3972>What a pity!</t3972><t3973>"</t3973>
<t3974>Before going to bed, we went to see poor Lucy.</t3974> <t3975>The undertaker had certainly done his job well, because the room had turned into a small chapelle ardente.</t3975> <t3976>There was a view of a meadow made up of beautiful white flowers, and death had been made as little repulsive as possible.</t3976> <t3977>The edge of the shroud was draped over her face; when the Professor leaned in and pulled back the cover, we both recoiled at the beauty illuminated sufficiently by the long candles and lying before us.</t3977> <t3978>When she died, all of Lucy's beauty had returned, and the passing hours had revived the beauty of life in such a way that I could hardly believe I was looking at a corpse, rather than leaving the destructive marks of decay.</t3978>
<t3979>The professor appeared with a stern seriousness.</t3979> <t3980>He did not love Lucy like I did, and there was no need for tears in his eyes.</t3980> <t3981>"Stay here until I return," he said and left the room.</t3981> <t3982>He took a handful of wild garlic from the unopened box waiting in the hallway and placed the flowers among the others, here and there on the bed.</t3982> <t3983>Then he took a small gold cross from around his neck, under his collar, and placed it in Lucy's mouth.</t3983> <t3984>He covered the shroud as before, and we left the room together.</t3984>
<t3985>Just as I was changing my clothes in my room, he knocked on the door and entered, immediately starting to speak: "Tomorrow, before evening, I want you to bring me a set of autopsy scalpels."</t3985><t3986>"</t3986>
<t3987>“Is it necessary for us to perform an autopsy?” I asked.</t3987>
<t3988>“Yes and no.</t3988> <t3989>I want to perform an operation, but not in the way you think.</t3989> <t3990>Let me explain it to you now, but not a word to anyone else.</t3990> <t3991>I want to cut off his head and take out his heart.</t3991> <t3992>Ah, you are a surgeon and you are so surprised!</t3992> <t3993>You, whom I have seen with my own eyes, perform life-and-death surgeries that make others' hair stand on end without your hand or heart trembling.</t3993> <t3994>Ah, but my dear friend John, I must not forget that you love her; but I have not forgotten, and that is why I will perform the operation and you will only assist.</t3994> <t3995>I want to do it tonight, but I must not for Arthur's sake; he will be free after his father's funeral tomorrow and will want to see her.</t3995> <t3996>Then, when she is placed in the coffin the next day, you and I will come while everyone is asleep.</t3996> <t3997>We will open the coffin lid and perform the operation; then, we will put everything back in place so that no one else will know.</t3997><t3998>”</t3998>
<t3999>But why are we doing all this?</t3999> <t4000>The girl is dead.</t4000> <t4001>Why should we unnecessarily cut and dissect her poor body?</t4001> <t4002>And if there is no need for an autopsy and nothing to gain from it - no benefit to her, to us, to science, or to human knowledge - why are we doing it?</t4002> <t4003>If there is no necessity, this is monstrous!</t4003><t4004>”</t4004>
<t4005>In response, he placed his hand on my shoulder and said with infinite sensitivity:</t4005>
<t4006>“My friend John, I pity your poor bleeding heart; I love you even more because it bleeds this way.</t4006> <t4007>If I could, I would take the burden you carry upon myself.</t4007> <t4008>But there are things you do not know and will learn, and pray for me because I know them, for they are not pleasant things at all.</t4008> <t4009>John, my son, you have been my friend for years and have you ever seen me act without a just cause?</t4009> <t4010>I may make mistakes - I am human; but I believe in everything I do.</t4010> <t4011>Weren't these the reasons you called me when this great trouble arose?</t4011> <t4012>Yes! Weren't you surprised - no, weren't you horrified when I did not allow Arthur to kiss his beloved, who was about to die, and separated them with all my strength?</t4012> <t4013>Yes! But still, didn't you see how she thanked me with those beautiful dying eyes, with that weak voice, and kissed my rough old hands and blessed me?</t4013> <t4014>Yes! And didn't you hear me promise her as she closed her eyes in gratitude?</t4014> <t4015>Yes!</t4015>
<t4016>Eh, now, I have a justified reason for everything I want to do.</t4016> <t4017>For many years you trusted me; you believed in me during the past weeks when many strange things happened that could very well have made you suspicious.</t4017> <t4018>Believe in me a little more, my friend John.</t4018> <t4019>If you don't trust me, I have to tell you what I think; it most likely won't be a good thing.</t4019> <t4020>And if I work without my friend who trusts me - and I will work whether there is trust or not - I will work feeling very lonely, without peace of mind, and in need of all possible help and courage!” He paused for a moment and continued solemnly: “My friend John, we have strange and terrible days ahead of us.</t4020> <t4021>Let us be one person, not two, and work for a good end in this way.</t4021> <t4022>Won't you have faith in me?</t4022><t4023>”</t4023>
<t4024>I held her hand and promised her.</t4024> <t4025>As I left the room, I kept my door open and watched her enter her own room and close the door.</t4025> <t4026>While standing still, I saw one of the servants quietly pass through the corridor - his back was turned to me, so he didn't see me - and enter the room where Lucy was lying.</t4026> <t4027>What I saw touched me.</t4027> <t4028>Loyalty is a very rare thing, and we are grateful to those who show it unconditionally to our loved ones.</t4028> <t4029>Here before us is a poor young girl who, naturally putting aside her deep fears of death, goes alone to stand by the coffin of her beloved lady so that she is not alone before her poor body is laid to eternal rest...</t4029>
<t4030>I must have had a long and deep sleep, because when Van Helsing came to my room and woke me up, the day was already well-lit.</t4030> <t4031>He came to my bedside and said:</t4031>
<t4032>“You don't need to worry about the scalpels; we won't be doing that job.</t4032><t4033>”</t4033>
<t4034>“Why?” I asked.</t4034> <t4035>Because the seriousness of the previous night had deeply affected me.</t4035>
<t4036>“Because,” he said harshly, “It is now too late - or too early.</t4036> <t4037>Look!” Right here, he lifted the small golden cross.</t4037> <t4038>“This was stolen last night.</t4038><t4039>”</t4039>
<t4040>“Now that you have it in your possession,” I asked curiously, “how was it stolen?</t4040><t4041>”</t4041>
<t4042>“Because I took it back from the worthless wretch who stole it, the woman who robs both the living and the dead.</t4042> <t4043>Her punishment will come, but it won't be from me; she has no idea what she has done and unknowingly, she only committed theft.</t4043> <t4044>Now we must wait.</t4044><t4045>”</t4045>
<t4046>As soon as he said this, he left, leaving me with a new mystery to ponder and a new puzzle to wrestle with.</t4046>
<t4047>The hours before noon were dreary, but at noon the legal advisor arrived: Mr. Marquand from Wholeman, Sons, Marquand & Lidderdale.</t4047> <t4048>He was very cheerful and appreciated what we had done, taking the task of dealing with the details off our shoulders.</t4048> <t4049>During lunch, he mentioned that Ms. Westenra had been expecting to die suddenly due to her heart condition for some time and had put her affairs in perfect order; he explained that all movable and immovable properties, except for an estate belonging to Lucy's father and going to a distant branch of the family since she was not a direct heir, were left to Arthur Holmwood.</t4049> <t4050>After telling us this, he continued his words as follows:</t4050>
<t4051>“Frankly, we did everything we could to avoid such an arrangement regarding the will and pointed out certain possibilities where his daughter would be left penniless or would not be very free if she acted according to a marital bond.</t4051> <t4052>Seriously, we went so far on the matter that we were almost about to disagree, because he asked if we were ready to fulfill his wishes.</t4052> <t4053>Of course, at that moment we had no choice but to accept.</t4053> <t4054>In principle, we were right and with the logic of events, we could prove the correctness of our thoughts ninety-nine percent.</t4054> <t4055>But frankly, in this case, any other attitude would make it impossible to fulfill his wishes.</t4055> <t4056>Because if he died before his daughter, she would be the owner of the estate, and if she lived even five minutes longer than her mother, in the absence of a will - which would be impossible in such a case - it would be considered as if no will had been left.</t4056> <t4057>In such a case, Lord Godalming, despite being a very good friend, would have no rights; the heirs, being distant relatives, would not renounce their rights for emotional reasons related to a complete stranger.</t4057> <t4058>I assure you, gentlemen, this result pleases me, pleases me greatly.</t4058><t4059>”</t4059>
<t4060>The legal advisor was a good person, but his rejoicing over such a small part of a great tragedy - the part he was officially concerned with - served as a lesson on the limits of empathetic understanding.</t4060>
<t4061>Adam did not stay with us long, but he said he would come to see Lord Godalming later in the day.</t4061> <t4062>But his arrival had certainly reassured us, as he had given us confidence that we need not fear hostile criticism for our actions.</t4062> <t4063>Arthur was expected to arrive at five o'clock, so shortly before that time, we visited the death chamber.</t4063> <t4064>Now that both mother and daughter lay there, it truly was a death chamber.</t4064> <t4065>The undertaker, true to his profession, had worked to display his wares in the best possible manner, and there was an air of death in the place that immediately dampened our spirits.</t4065> <t4066>Van Helsing ordered that the previous arrangement be adhered to, explaining that Lord Godalming would arrive very soon and that it would break his heart less to see the remains of his fiancée alone.</t4066> <t4067>The undertaker, astounded by his own folly, worked hard to restore everything to the way we had left it the night before, thus preventing Arthur from experiencing a shock to his emotions when he arrived.</t4067>
<t4068>Poor man!</t4068> <t4069>He looked extremely sad and dejected; even his bold masculinity seemed to have collapsed under the strain of his heavily tested emotions.</t4069> <t4070>I know that he was truly and selflessly devoted to his father; losing him, especially at such a time, was a very painful blow for him.</t4070> <t4071>When he was with me, he was as warm as ever and showed a pleasant courtesy towards Van Helsing; but I couldn't help noticing that he was holding himself back a bit.</t4071> <t4072>The Professor noticed this too and signaled to me to bring Lord Godalming upstairs.</t4072> <t4073>I did so and left him at the door of the room, feeling that he would want to be alone with Lucy; but as he grabbed my arm and pulled me inside, he said:</t4073>
<t4074>“You loved him too, my old friend; he told me everything and had no friend closer to his heart than you.</t4074> <t4075>I don't know how to thank you for all you did for him.</t4075> <t4076>I can't think yet...</t4076><t4077>”</t4077>
<t4078>Right there she lost herself and threw her arms around my shoulders, resting her head on my chest, and said while crying: "Oh, Jack! Jack! Jack! What am I going to do?</t4078> <t4079>It feels as if my entire life has suddenly been taken away from me and there's nothing left in this vast world worth living for.</t4079><t4080>"</t4080>
<t4081>I comforted him as much as I could.</t4081> <t4082>In situations like these, a person doesn't need many words.</t4082> <t4083>Holding a hand tightly, putting an arm around the shoulder, sobbing together are expressions of empathy that touch a man's heart.</t4083> <t4084>I stood still and silent until his sobs subsided, and then I slowly said:</t4084>
<t4085>"Come and look at it."</t4085><t4086></t4086>
<t4087>We moved towards the bed together and lifted the fine linen cloth from her face.</t4087> <t4088>My God! How beautiful she was.</t4088> <t4089>It seemed as if each passing hour increased her beauty.</t4089> <t4090>This somehow frightened and surprised me; as for Arthur, he started trembling and eventually shook with suspicion as if he had caught a fever.</t4090> <t4091>Finally, after a long pause, he said in a faint whisper:</t4091>
<t4092>“Jack, is he really dead?</t4092><t4093>”</t4093>
<t4094>Regretfully, I convinced him that it was so, and continued my words by suggesting that it is a common occurrence for faces to soften and even return to their youthful beauty after death; this is especially seen in deaths that come after heavy and prolonged suffering - because I felt that I could not allow such a terrible doubt to last for more than a moment.</t4094> <t4095>This explanation seemed to dispel all doubts, and after kneeling beside the couch for a while and looking at Lucy lovingly for a long time, he turned his head aside.</t4095> <t4096>I told him to say his farewells as the coffin needed to be prepared; thus he turned back, took Lucy's hand in his, kissed it, bent down, and kissed her forehead.</t4096> <t4097>As he walked out of the room, he looked at her lovingly over his shoulder.</t4097>
<t4098>I left Arthur in the living room and told Van Helsing that Lord Godalming had said his farewells; thus, the Professor went to the kitchen to tell the undertaker's men to continue the preparations and nail the coffin shut.</t4098> <t4099>When he came out of the room once more, I relayed Arthur's question to him and he responded:</t4099>
<t4100>“I'm not surprised.</t4100> <t4101>A moment ago, I also had doubts for a second!</t4101><t4102>”</t4102>
<t4103>We all had dinner together; I could see that poor Arthur was trying his best.</t4103> <t4104>Van Helsing was silent throughout the meal, but when we lit our cigars, he said:</t4104>
<t4105>"Lord," Arthur interrupted:</t4105>
<t4106>“No, no, not like that, for God's sake! Whatever happens, not yet.</t4106> <t4107>Forgive me, sir: I did not mean to speak aggressively; it's just that my loss is still very fresh.</t4107><t4108>”</t4108>
<t4109>The professor answered very sweetly:</t4109>
<t4110>“The only reason I used that name was because I was in doubt.</t4110> <t4111>I shouldn't address you as 'mr' and I have started to love you as Arthur, yes my dear son, to love you.</t4111><t4112>”</t4112>
<t4113>Arthur reached out and sincerely shook the old man's hand.</t4113>
<t4114>“You may address me in any manner you wish,” he said.</t4114> <t4115>“I hope that I will always hold the title of friend.</t4115> <t4116>And please allow me to say that I cannot find the words to thank you for the kindness you have shown to my poor beloved.”</t4116> <t4117>He paused for a moment and continued: “I know that she has understood your kindness even better than I have; if I have been rude or if I have somehow been at fault while you were acting - you remember,” the Professor nodded, “you must forgive me.</t4117><t4118>”</t4118>
<t4119>The professor replied with a dignified politeness:</t4119>
<t4120>“I know that trusting me is difficult for you at this time, because believing in such violence requires understanding; now I conclude that you do not trust me -cannot trust me- because you do not yet understand.</t4120> <t4121>And many times more, while you cannot understand -even if you want to understand- and while you should not understand, I will ask you to trust me.</t4121> <t4122>But there will come times when you will trust me completely, as if you understand it as clearly as daylight.</t4122> <t4123>Then, for your own sake, for the sake of others, and for the sweet sake of the young lady whom I have sworn to protect, you will bless me from beginning to end.</t4123><t4124>”</t4124>
<t4125>"Indeed, indeed, sir," said Arthur warmly, "I will trust you in every respect.</t4125> <t4126>I know and believe that you have a very noble heart, that you are a friend of Jack, and also a friend of Lucy.</t4126> <t4127>You can do whatever you want.</t4127><t4128>"</t4128>
<t4129>The professor cleared his throat a few times as if he were about to speak and finally said:</t4129>
<t4130>“Then can I ask you something now?” “Of course.”</t4130><t4131>”</t4131>
<t4132>"You do know that Ms. Westenra has left all her property to you, don't you?"</t4132><t4133>"</t4133>
<t4134>"No, poor thing; I had never thought of that."</t4134><t4135>"</t4135>
<t4136>"And since it all belongs to you, you have the right to manage it as you wish.</t4136> <t4137>I ask you to allow me to read all the documents and letters belonging to Miss Westenra.</t4137> <t4138>Believe me, this is not an unnecessary curiosity.</t4138> <t4139>Believe me, I have a reason that she would approve of.</t4139> <t4140>All the documents are here.</t4140> <t4141>I took them before knowing that everything belonged to you, so that no foreign hand would touch them - no foreign eye would look at the words of her soul.</t4141> <t4142>If you allow, let them stay with me; you don't even see them yet, but I will keep them safe.</t4142> <t4143>No word will be lost and I will return them to you when the time comes.</t4143> <t4144>It's a difficult thing to ask, but you will do it for Lucy's sake, won't you?</t4144><t4145>"</t4145>
<t4146>Arthur spoke warmly, as he used to:</t4146>
<t4147>“Dr. Van Helsing, you can do whatever you want.</t4147> <t4148>By saying this, I feel that I am doing something my beloved would approve of.</t4148> <t4149>Until the time comes, I will not bother you with my questions.</t4149><t4150>”</t4150>
<t4151>The elderly Professor stood up and said in a serious manner:</t4151>
<t4152>“And you are right.</t4152> <t4153>It will be painful for all of us; but it won't all be pain and this pain won't be the last pain.</t4153> <t4154>We and you - especially you, my dear son - will have to pass through bitter waters before reaching the sweet waters.</t4154> <t4155>But our hearts must be brave, we must not be selfish, and we must do our duty; everything will be alright!</t4155><t4156>”</t4156>
<t4157>That night, I slept on the couch in Arthur's room.</t4157>
<t4158>Van Helsing never slept.</t4158> <t4159>He walked back and forth as if patrolling the house and never took his eyes off the room where Lucy lay in her coffin, surrounded by wild garlic flowers that sent a dominant scent through the night amidst the smells of lilies and roses.</t4159>

<t4161>September 22 - Exeter train.</t4161> <t4162>Jonathan is sleeping.</t4162> <t4163>So much has happened since the last time I wrote here, which feels like it was just yesterday, when I was in Whitby and the whole world was ahead of me, when Jonathan was far away and I had no news from him; now, I am married to Jonathan, Jonathan has become a legal advisor, a partner, wealthy, and the owner of his own business, Mr. Hawkins has died and been buried; Jonathan had another fit that could harm him.</t4163> <t4164>One day he might ask me something about it.</t4164> <t4165>I am writing everything down.</t4165> <t4166>My shorthand has gotten rusty - see what unexpected happiness does to us - but it would be good to revive my shorthand by practicing in one way or another...</t4166>
<t4167>The funeral ceremony was very simple and solemn.</t4167> <t4168>Only we, the servants, a couple of friends from Exeter, the London representative, a gentleman representing Sir John Paxton, and the President of the United Law Society were there.</t4168> <t4169>Jonathan and I stood hand in hand and felt that our best, closest friend had left us...</t4169>
<t4170>We boarded a bus to Hyde Park Corner and quietly returned to the city.</t4170> <t4171>Jonathan thought it might interest me to go to Row for a while, so we sat down; but there were very few people; seeing so many empty chairs was sad and gloomy.</t4171> <t4172>This made us think of the empty chairs at home; so we got up and walked to Piccadilly.</t4172> <t4173>Jonathan was holding my arm as he used to in the old days before I went to school.</t4173> <t4174>I felt this was very inappropriate because you can't teach other girls manners and etiquette for years without practicing what you preach; but it was Jonathan, and he was my husband; we didn't know any of the people who saw us - we didn't care if they saw us or not - so we continued walking.</t4174> <t4175>Just as I was looking at a very beautiful girl with a wide-brimmed hat sitting in a car outside Giulino's place, I felt Jonathan squeeze my arm painfully; he whispered, "Oh my God!"</t4175> <t4176>I'm always worried about Jonathan because I'm afraid of his nervous breakdown overwhelming him again; so I quickly turned to him and asked what was bothering him.</t4176>
<t4177>He was very pale, and I saw that his eyes were bulging out of their sockets with a mix of half-terror and half-astonishment as he looked at the long, thin, hook-nosed man with a black mustache and a pointed beard who was watching that beautiful girl.</t4177> <t4178>The man was looking at the young girl so intently that he didn't see either of us, so I examined him closely.</t4178> <t4179>His face was not a good face; it was harsh, ruthless, and sensual, and his large white teeth, which appeared even whiter because his lips were excessively red, were pointed like those of an animal.</t4179> <t4180>Jonathan continued to look at him until he made me afraid that the man would notice.</t4180> <t4181>I feared that the man would misunderstand this, he looked very ruthless and rude.</t4181> <t4182>I asked Jonathan why he was disturbed, thinking I had as much knowledge about the matter as he did: “Do you see who he is?</t4182><t4183>”</t4183>
<t4184>"No, dear," I said, "I don't know him; who is he?"</t4184> <t4185>The answer surprised and frightened me because it seemed as if it was said without knowing that the person being spoken to was me, Mina:</t4185>
<t4186>"That's the man himself!"</t4186><t4187>"</t4187>
<t4188>It was clear that my poor lover was afraid of something - extremely afraid; if I hadn't been there to support and be with her, she would have collapsed.</t4188> <t4189>She continued to watch the man; a man came out of the shop with a small package and handed it to the young lady who drove away in her car after receiving it.</t4189> <t4190>The dark man's eyes were on the girl, and as the car moved along Piccadilly, he followed in the same direction and called for a carriage.</t4190> <t4191>Jonathan continued to watch after him and said as if talking to himself:</t4191>
<t4192>“I think it was the Count, but younger.</t4192> <t4193>My God, if it is! Oh, my God! My God! If only I knew!</t4193> <t4194>If only I knew!”</t4194> <t4195>He was tormenting himself so much that I was afraid to ask questions and occupy his mind with the subject, so I remained silent.</t4195> <t4196>I quietly led him away from there, he came without resistance, holding my arm.</t4196> <t4197>We walked a bit more and went to Green Park and sat there for a while.</t4197> <t4198>It was a warm day for autumn, and there was a comfortable bench in the shade.</t4198> <t4199>After staring into space for a few minutes, Jonathan's eyes closed and he fell asleep quietly with his head on my shoulder.</t4199> <t4200>I thought this was the best thing for him, so I did not disturb him.</t4200> <t4201>He woke up in about twenty minutes and said quite cheerfully:</t4201>
<t4202>“Ah! Did I fall asleep, Mina?</t4202> <t4203>Oh, forgive me for being so rude.</t4203> <t4204>Come, let's sit somewhere and have some tea.”</t4204> <t4205>Clearly, due to his illness, he had forgotten everything this event reminded him of, as well as everything related to the dark gentleman.</t4205> <t4206>I do not like this state of forgetfulness; it could damage the brain or sustain existing damage.</t4206> <t4207>I must not ask him, because I fear causing more harm than good; but somehow, I must learn the facts about his journey abroad.</t4207> <t4208>I fear the time has come to open that bundle and find out what is written inside.</t4208> <t4209>Ah, Jonathan, I know you will forgive me if I am making a mistake, but this is for your dear sake.</t4209>
<t4210>Later on.</t4210> <t4211>-A sorrowful return home from every angle- the dear person who treated us so well is not at home; Jonathan, still pale and dazed due to a slight relapse of his illness; a telegram from someone named Van Helsing:</t4211>
<t4212>You will be sorry to learn that Ms. Westenra died five days ago and that Lucy also died the day before yesterday.</t4212> <t4213>Both were buried today.</t4213>
<t4214>Ah, what great sorrow conveyed in just a few words!</t4214> <t4215>Poor Ms. Westenra! Poor Lucy! They have gone, never to return to us again, gone!</t4215> <t4216>And poor, poor Arthur, who has lost such sweetness from his life! God, help us to endure our troubles.</t4216>

<t4218>September 22 - Everything is over.</t4218> <t4219>Arthur returned to the Ring and took Quincey Morris with him.</t4219> <t4220>Quincey is such a good man!</t4220> <t4221>I truly believe that he suffered as much as we did because of Lucy's death; but he behaved like a virtuous Viking during that time.</t4221> <t4222>If America continues to raise such men, it will indeed be a significant power in the world.</t4222> <t4223>Van Helsing is lying down to rest before his journey.</t4223> <t4224>He is going to Amsterdam tonight, but he says he will return tomorrow night, and that he only wants to make some arrangements that he needs to handle personally.</t4224> <t4225>Then, if he can manage, he will stay with me; he says he has some business in London that might take up some of his time.</t4225> <t4226>Poor old man!</t4226> <t4227>I fear the tension of the past week has worn down his iron strength.</t4227> <t4228>Throughout the entire funeral, I could see that he was holding himself terribly tight.</t4228> <t4229>When everything was over, we were standing next to poor Arthur, who was talking about his role in the transfusion of his own blood into Lucy's veins; I could see Van Helsing's face turning alternately white and purple.</t4229> <t4230>Arthur has been saying since then that he feels as if they were truly married, as if Lucy were his wife in the eyes of God.</t4230> <t4231>Neither of us spoke a word about the other procedures, and we never will.</t4231> <t4232>Arthur and Quincey went to the station together, and Van Helsing and I came here.</t4232> <t4233>As soon as we were alone in the carriage, Van Helsing had a hysterical fit.</t4233> <t4234>Since then, he has been denying that it was hysteria and says it was just his sense of humor showing itself under terrible circumstances.</t4234> <t4235>He laughed until he started crying, and I had to lower the blinds so no one would see us and misunderstand; then he cried until he laughed again; then he both laughed and cried at the same time like a woman.</t4235> <t4236>I tried to be stern with him, just as one would be with women in such a situation; but it had no effect.</t4236> <t4237>The ways in which women and men express their nervous strengths and weaknesses are so different!</t4237> <t4238>Then, when his face took on a serious and stern expression, I asked him why he had been cheerful and why he had been cheerful at such a time.</t4238> <t4239>His answer was unique, because it was logical, impressive, and mysterious.</t4239> <t4240>He said:</t4240>
<t4241>‘Ah, you don't understand, my friend John.</t4241><t4242>Even if I laugh, don't think that I'm not sad.</t4242><t4243>Look, I cried even while choking with laughter.</t4243><t4244>Always remember that the laughter knocking on your door and asking, ‘May I come in?’ is not real laughter.</t4244><t4245>No! It is a king and comes whenever and however it wants.</t4245><t4246>It doesn't ask anyone, it doesn't wait for the right time.</t4246><t4247>‘I have arrived,’ it says.</t4247><t4248>Look, for example, my heart bleeds for that very sweet young girl; despite being old and exhausted, I give my blood for her; I give my time, my talent, my sleep; just so she can have it all, I allow my other patients to be deprived of it.</t4248><t4249>But still, I can laugh right at her grave - while the soil falls on her coffin from the sexton's shovel until the blood drains from my cheeks and it calls out to my heart, ‘Pat! Pat!’ I can laugh.</t4249><t4250>My heart bleeds for that poor child - for the beloved child who would be the same age as my own son if he had lived and whose hair and eyes would be just like his.</t4250><t4251>Now you know why I love her so much.</t4251><t4252>But when it strikes my husbandly heart at its core and causes my fatherly heart to be more emotional than for anyone else - not even for you, my friend John, because our experiences are more equal than those of father and son - even at such times, King Laughter comes to me, dancing with blood, bringing some of the daylight he carries to my cheek, shouting in my ear, ‘Here I am!</t4252><t4253>Here I am!’</t4253><t4254>Ah, my friend John, this world is a strange, sorrowful world, full of unhappiness, pain, and trouble, and when King Laughter comes, he makes everything dance to the tune they play.</t4254><t4255>Bleeding hearts, dry bones in the churchyard, and tears burning as they fall - they all dance to the music made by his unsmiling mouth.</t4255><t4256>And believe me, my friend John, it's a good thing he comes.</t4256><t4257>Ah, we men and women are like taut strings pulling us in different directions.</t4257><t4258>The last tears come; like raindrops on the strings, perhaps they strengthen us until the tension is too much and we snap.</t4258><t4259>But King Laughter comes like daylight, easing the tension again, and whatever the task is, we endure to continue our work.</t4259><t4260>”</t4260>
<t4261>I didn't want to hurt him by pretending not to understand his thought; but since I still didn't understand the reason for his laughter, I asked him about it.</t4261> <t4262>As he replied to me, his face hardened and in a rather different tone, he said:</t4262>
<t4263>“Ah, the bitter irony among all this was - this beautiful lady, adorned with flowers, looking so lovely as if she were still alive until we each wondered if she was really dead; she lies in that beautiful marble house in the desolate churchyard, where many of her kin rest, where she lies with her mother who loved her dearly and whom she loved dearly; that sacred bell tolls 'Ding! Ding! Ding!' sadly and slowly; those holy men, pretending to read books in angelic white garments, but their eyes never go to the pages; all our heads are bowed.</t4263> <t4264>What is all this for?</t4264> <t4265>She is dead; well! Isn't she?</t4265><t4266>”</t4266>
<t4267>“Eh, whatever I do, Professor,” I said, “I can't see anything to laugh about in this.</t4267> <t4268>Your explanation has turned it into an even more difficult riddle.</t4268> <t4269>Even if the funeral ceremony was ridiculous, what about poor Art and his suffering.</t4269> <t4270>His heart was clearly breaking.</t4270><t4271>”</t4271>
<t4272>"Absolutely so.</t4272> <t4273>Didn’t he say that with the transfusion of his blood into her veins, Lucy was truly his wife?</t4273><t4274>"</t4274>
<t4275>"Yes, and this was a sweet and comforting thought for him."</t4275><t4276></t4276>
<t4277>“No doubt.</t4277> <t4278>But there was a problem there, my friend John.</t4278> <t4279>If so, then what about the others?</t4279> <t4280>Ha, ha! Then this sweet young girl is polyandrous and I, with my wife who is dead to me but still alive by Church law, but without a mind, completely gone in the head – even I am bigamous with this now non-existent wife.</t4280><t4281>”</t4281>
<t4282>“I don't see what's so funny here!” I said; I wasn't very pleased with him for saying such things.</t4282> <t4283>He put his hand on my arm and said:</t4283>
<t4284>“My friend John, if I am causing pain, forgive me.</t4284> <t4285>While I could have hurt others, I did not show my feelings to them, but I can show them only to you, my old friend whom I trust.</t4285> <t4286>If you could look deep into my heart when I wanted to laugh; if you could have done this when laughter came; if you could do this now, as King Laughter is gathering his crown and everything to go far, far away from me for a very, very long time, perhaps you would pity me more than anyone else.</t4286><t4287>”</t4287>
<t4288>The kindness in her voice touched me deeply, and I asked why.</t4288>
<t4289>“Because I know!</t4289><t4290>”</t4290>
<t4291>And now we are all in a wretched state; for long days, loneliness will sit with its wings deep in thought above our roofs.</t4291> <t4292>Lucy lies in the grand house of the dead in the deserted churchyard, far from the crowded London, among the graves of her relatives; here the air is clean, the sun rises over Hampstead Hill, and wildflowers grow on their own.</t4292>
<t4293>Thus, I can now finish this journal; only God knows whether I will start a new one or not.</t4293> <t4294>If I do start or open this one again, it will be to talk about different people and different subjects; because here, where the story of the love of my life is told, I say with sorrow and hopelessness before I return to taking control of my professional life.</t4294>

<t4297>THE HAMPSTEAD MYSTERY</t4297>
<t4298>The Hampstead area is currently experiencing exciting days due to a series of developments similar to the events known as the "Kensington Horror" or the "Stabbing Woman" or the "Woman in Black" in the headlines.</t4298> <t4299>In the last two or three days, there have been numerous incidents involving small children who have wandered away from home or gone to play on the Heath and not returned.</t4299> <t4300>In all these cases, the children were too young to properly express themselves, but the common point in their supposed explanations was that they were with a "beautiful" lady.</t4300> <t4301>They all disappeared late at night, and in two cases, the children were not found until the early hours of the next day.</t4301> <t4302>There was a widespread belief that the first of the missing children used the excuse that "the beautiful lady said she wanted to take a walk with him," and the others followed this example as an excuse.</t4302> <t4303>These days, it is very understandable since the favorite thing of the little ones is to distract each other with small games.</t4303> <t4304>One of the reporters writes that it is extremely funny to see the little children playing "beautiful lady."</t4304> <t4305>He adds that some of our cartoonists could take lessons from these children on the fine satire of the grotesque that emerges when reality is compared to representation.</t4305> <t4306>The fact that the "beautiful lady" is the favorite role in these alfresco games is in harmony with the general principles of human nature.</t4306> <t4307>Our reporter naively states that even Ellen Terry could not have the charming appeal of some of these dirty-faced little children who are acting - and even believe themselves to be - the "beautiful lady."</t4307>
<t4308>But maybe the problem has a serious side because some of the children -actually all of those who disappeared at night- have small tears and wounds on their throats.</t4308> <t4309>The wounds seem to have been made by rats or small dogs, and although they are not very significant on their own, whatever animal made them shows that it has its own unique system or method.</t4309> <t4310>The local police were ordered to pay close attention to children wandering around Hampstead Heath and its surroundings, especially very young ones, and to any stray dogs that might be roaming the area.</t4310>

<t4316>According to the news we just received, another child who went missing last night was only found the next morning around noon, at the base of a blackthorn bush on the Shooter’s Hill side, which is less frequented compared to other parts of Hamstead Heath.</t4316> <t4317>He also has the small wound on his neck that was noticed in the other cases.</t4317> <t4318>He was extremely weak and looked skin and bones.</t4318> <t4319>When he partially regained consciousness, he also told that common story about being lured by the “beautiful lady.”</t4319>

<t4322>September 23.</t4322> <t4323>- We had a bad night, but Jonathan is better now.</t4323> <t4324>I'm glad he has a lot of work to do because it keeps his mind off the dreadful things; I'm happy that he's not overwhelmed by the responsibilities that come with his new position.</t4324> <t4325>I knew he would return to his old self, and now seeing my Jonathan climb to the peak of his promotion and adapt to the responsibilities on his shoulders in every way makes me so proud.</t4325> <t4326>He will be out all day, until late, because he said he couldn't have lunch at home.</t4326> <t4327>My housework is done, so I can take the journal he kept abroad and lock myself in my room to read it...</t4327>
<t4328>September 24.</t4328> <t4329>- Last night, I didn't have the heart to write; Jonathan's horrifying journal upset me so much!</t4329> <t4330>Poor dear!</t4330> <t4331>Whether what he wrote was real or entirely a figment of his imagination, who knows how much he suffered!</t4331> <t4332>I wonder if there is any truth in what was written.</t4332> <t4333>Did he first contract brain fever and then write all these horrifying things; or did he have some reasons for all of this?</t4333> <t4334>I suppose I will never know, as I will never dare to bring up the subject with him...</t4334> <t4335>And what about that man we saw yesterday!</t4335> <t4336>Jonathan seemed very sure about him...</t4336> <t4337>Poor dear!</t4337> <t4338>I think it was the funeral that upset him and brought his mind back to such thoughts.</t4338> <t4339>He believes in all of this.</t4339> <t4340>I remember him saying on our wedding day: "A crucial task, whether I am asleep or awake, whether I have lost my mind or am in my right mind, as long as it does not require me to return to those painful hours.”</t4340> <t4341>There seems to be some kind of logical connection in all of this.</t4341> <t4342>That terrifying Count was coming to London.</t4342> <t4343>“If this happens and the Count has come to London, filled with millions of people.”</t4343> <t4344>It could be an important task and we must not avoid it.</t4344> <t4345>I must be prepared.</t4345> <t4346>I will get my typewriter right now and start making a copy of this journal.</t4346> <t4347>Thus, if necessary, we will be prepared for other eyes to read it.</t4347> <t4348>And if the need arises; then perhaps, if I am ready, poor Jonathan will not be further shaken by these events, because I can speak on his behalf and prevent him from being distressed and worried about this.</t4348> <t4349>If Jonathan can overcome this anxiety, he may want to tell me all about it, and then I can ask him questions, learn something, and understand how I can comfort him.</t4349>

<t4353>Dear Madam,</t4353>
<t4354>Forgive me for writing to you about the sad news of Miss Lucy Westenra's death.</t4354><t4355>Due to the kindness of Lord Godalming, I have the authority to read the young lady's letters and documents, as I have deep concerns about some matters of vital importance.</t4355><t4356>Among these papers, I found some of your letters showing how close friends you were and how much you loved her.</t4356><t4357>Oh, Madam Mina, I beg you, for the sake of that love, help me.</t4357><t4358>I ask this for the good of others - to correct a great mistake and to eliminate great and terrible troubles - which may be greater than you can even imagine.</t4358><t4359>Is it possible for me to see you?</t4359><t4360>You can trust me.</t4360><t4361>I am a friend of Dr. John Seward and Lord Godalming (who was Miss Lucy's Arthur).</t4361><t4362>For now, I must keep this from everyone.</t4362><t4363>If you tell me when and where I should be, I will come to Exeter immediately to see you, if I may have the privilege of doing so.</t4363><t4364>I have read the letters you wrote to poor Lucy, and I know the pains you and your husband have suffered; therefore, I beg you, if possible, do not inform him about this matter to avoid causing him harm.</t4364><t4365>Once again, I beg your pardon, forgive me.</t4365>

<t4367>Telegram from Ms. Harker to Van Helsing</t4367>
<t4368>September 25.</t4368> <t4369>- If you can make it, come with the quarter past train today.</t4369> <t4370>I can see you whenever you arrive.</t4370>
<t4371>WILHELMINA HARKER</t4371>
<t4372>Mina Harker's diary</t4372>
<t4373>September 25 - As Dr. Van Helsing's visit approaches, I can't help but feel an overwhelming excitement because somehow, I hope this visit will shed light on Jonathan's distressing experience; since he took care of Lucy during her last illness, he can tell me everything about her.</t4373> <t4374>The reason for his visit is this; it is not about Jonathan, but about Lucy and her sleepwalking.</t4374> <t4375>Then, I can never learn the truth now!</t4375> <t4376>How foolish I am!</t4376> <t4377>That dreadful journal has captured my imagination and is slowly coloring everything in its own hue.</t4377> <t4378>Of course, this visit is about Lucy.</t4378> <t4379>Poor thing, she had reverted to her old habit and that dreadful night on the hill must have made her sick.</t4379> <t4380>She must have told Dr. Van Helsing about the sleepwalking adventure on the hill and that I knew about it; and now the Doctor wants me to tell him about it so he can understand the situation.</t4380> <t4381>I hope I did the right thing by not mentioning this to Mrs. Westenra; if any of my actions, or even inactions, have harmed poor dear Lucy, I will never forgive myself.</t4381> <t4382>I also hope Dr. Van Helsing will not blame me; I have been subjected to such distress and anxiety lately that I feel I can no longer bear any more.</t4382>
<t4383>I think crying from time to time does us a lot of good - it clears the air like rain.</t4383> <t4384>Perhaps what upset me was reading the journal yesterday and Jonathan not being by my side for the first time since the beginning of our marriage, for an entire day and night.</t4384> <t4385>I hope my dear husband takes care of himself and that nothing happens to upset him.</t4385> <t4386>It is now two o'clock, the doctor will be here soon.</t4386> <t4387>Unless he asks me something about it, I will not tell him anything about Jonathan's journal.</t4387> <t4388>I am very glad that I am typing my own journal, so that if he asks about Lucy, I can give him the journal; this will save us from many questions.</t4388>
<t4389>Later.</t4389> <t4390>- Dr. Van Helsing came and went.</t4390> <t4391>Oh, what a strange meeting it was and how it made my head spin!</t4391> <t4392>I feel like I'm dreaming.</t4392> <t4393>Can all this, even a part of it, be possible?</t4393> <t4394>If I hadn't read Jonathan's journal first, I wouldn't accept even the slightest possibility.</t4394> <t4395>Poor, poor dear Jonathan!</t4395> <t4396>How much he must have suffered!</t4396> <t4397>Please, dear God, don't let all this unsettle him again.</t4397> <t4398>I will try to protect him from it; but knowing for certain that his eyes, ears, and mind did not deceive him, that it was all real - even though it is terrible and has bad consequences, it might be a comfort to him and help him.</t4398> <t4399>Perhaps what troubles him is doubt; maybe when this doubt is removed, when it is proven that all this is real, he will be more content and better able to endure this shock.</t4399> <t4400>If he is a friend of Arthur and Dr. Seward and they brought him from Holland to take care of Lucy, Dr. Van Helsing must be as wise as he is good.</t4400> <t4401>After seeing him, I feel that he is a good, kind, and noble person.</t4401> <t4402>When tomorrow comes, I will ask him about Jonathan; and then, please God, let all this sorrow and worry come to a good end.</t4402> <t4403>I always thought I would want to do interviews; Jonathan's friend at the Exeter News told him that in such a job memory is everything - that is, you need to be able to put every word spoken on paper exactly as it was said, even if you need to correct some parts later.</t4403> <t4404>This was a rare interview; I will try to put it on paper word for word.</t4404>
<t4405>When the doorbell rang, it was half-past two.</t4405> <t4406>I gathered my courage and waited.</t4406> <t4407>Within a few minutes, Mary opened the door and said, "Dr. Van Helsing has arrived."</t4407>
<t4408>I stood up and greeted him with a nod of my head. The Doctor approached me; a medium-height, broad, strong-built man with shoulders set on a deep chest and a neck well-balanced on his body, just like the head balanced on his neck.</t4408> <t4409>The posture of his head immediately struck one as a sign of thought and power; his head was noble, large, broad, and even broader behind the ears.</t4409> <t4410>His clean-shaven face revealed a bony chin, a large, determined mouth, a straight but sharp, sensitive nose of good proportions with wide nostrils that seemed to widen when his mouth tensed, and thick, bushy eyebrows.</t4410> <t4411>His forehead was broad and beautiful, rising almost straight up at first and then sloping back over two distinct protrusions and elevations; a forehead that his reddish hair could never quite cover, naturally falling back and to the sides.</t4411> <t4412>His large, dark blue eyes were set apart, bold, and could be soft or ruthless depending on his moods.</t4412> <t4413>He said to me:</t4413>
<t4414>“Ms. Harker, right?”</t4414> <t4415>I nodded in confirmation.</t4415>
<t4416>“Formerly Miss Mina Murray, isn't that right?”</t4416> <t4417>I nodded again.</t4417>
<t4418>“I have come to see Mina Murray, the friend of that poor dear child, Lucy Westenra.</t4418> <t4419>Madam Mina, I have come for the dead.</t4419><t4420>”</t4420>
<t4421>“Sir,” I said, “as a friend of Lucy Westenra and someone who helps her, you could not have a better claim over me.”</t4421> <t4422>And I extended my hand.</t4422> <t4423>He took my hand and softly said:</t4423>
<t4424>"Ah, Madam Mina, I knew that the friend of the poor innocent girl was a good person, but still, I needed to learn this."</t4424> <t4425>He finished his speech with a noble bow.</t4425> <t4426>I asked what he wanted to see me about, so he immediately began to speak:</t4426>
<t4427>“I read the letters you wrote to Miss Lucy.</t4427> <t4428>Forgive me, but I had to start the investigation somewhere and there was no one around to ask.</t4428> <t4429>I know you were with her in Whitby.</t4429> <t4430>She kept a journal from time to time - there’s no need to look surprised, Madam Mina; she started keeping it after you left her side and was imitating you - in this journal, she traces an incident of sleepwalking where, by deduction, she wrote that you saved her.</t4430> <t4431>I came to you extremely confused and I kindly ask you to tell me everything you remember.</t4431><t4432>”</t4432>
<t4433>"Dr. Van Helsing, I think I can tell you everything.</t4433><t4434>"</t4434>
<t4435>“Ah, then you remember the events and details very well, don't you?</t4435> <t4436>It is not a situation commonly seen in young ladies.</t4436><t4437>”</t4437>
<t4438>“No, Doctor, but I had written everything down at that time.</t4438> <t4439>If you want, I can show you what I wrote.</t4439><t4440>”</t4440>
<t4441>“Ah, Madam Mina, I would be grateful; you will have done me a great favor.”</t4441> <t4442>I couldn't resist the temptation to confuse him a little - I suppose it's the remnant of that first apple whose taste still lingers - and so I handed him the diary written in shorthand.</t4442> <t4443>He took it with a grateful nod and said:</t4443>
<t4444>“Can I read it?</t4444><t4445>”</t4445>
<t4446>"If you wish," I replied as calmly as I could.</t4446> <t4447>He opened the journal and his face fell for a moment.</t4447> <t4448>Then he stood up and nodded to me.</t4448>
<t4449>“Ah, you clever woman!” he said.</t4449> <t4450>“I have known for a long time that there was someone Mr. Jonathan should be grateful to; but look, his wife possesses every kind of wonderful quality.</t4450> <t4451>And would you do me the honor of helping me by reading this for me?</t4451> <t4452>Alas! I do not know stenography.”</t4452> <t4453>During this time, my little joke had come to an end and I was almost ashamed; so, I took the typed copy out of my work basket and handed it to him.</t4453>
<t4454>“Forgive me,” I said, “I couldn't help myself; but I thought you might want to ask about dear Lucy and so you wouldn't have to wait - not just for my own sake, because I know your time must be valuable - I typed it out for you.”</t4454> <t4455>He took the papers in his hand and his eyes sparkled.</t4455> <t4456>“You are very kind,” he said, “so can I read this now?</t4456> <t4457>I might want to ask you some things while I read.</t4457><t4458>”</t4458>
<t4459>“Of course,” I said, “while I tell the servants to prepare lunch, you can read; then, while we eat together, you can ask me your questions.”</t4459> <t4460>She nodded and settled into the chair with her back to the light; I actually went to take care of lunch so she wouldn't be disturbed while reading my journal, and she got absorbed in the papers.</t4460> <t4461>When I returned, I saw her pacing back and forth in the room; her face was flushed with excitement.</t4461> <t4462>She ran to me and grabbed both of my hands.</t4462>
<t4463>“Ah, Madam Mina,” he said, “how can I tell you how much I owe you?</t4463> <t4464>This paper is like daylight.</t4464> <t4465>It opens the door for me.</t4465> <t4466>I am dazzled, my eyes are blinded by so much light; but still, clouds gather behind the light each time.</t4466> <t4467>But you do not understand this, you cannot understand.</t4467> <t4468>Ah, but I am grateful to you, you clever woman!</t4468> <t4469>Madam,” -he said this with great seriousness- “if there is anything that Abraham Van Helsing can do for you or your loved ones, I hope you will tell me.</t4469> <t4470>If I can serve you as a friend, it will be a great pleasure and satisfaction for me; as your friend, everything I have learned, everything I can do will be for the good of you and your loved ones.</t4470> <t4471>There are darknesses and lights in life; you are one of those lights.</t4471> <t4472>You will have a happy and good life, and your husband will be blessed with you.</t4472><t4473>”</t4473>
<t4474>“But Doctor, you flatter me too much and - and you don't know me.</t4474><t4475>”</t4475>
<t4476>“Do I not know you - I, who is now of a certain age and who has spent my entire life studying men and women; I, whose expertise is the brain, everything related to the brain, and everything that results from it!</t4476> <t4477>I read the journal you wrote so well, which breathes truth in every line.</t4477> <t4478>I, who read that sweet letter of yours to poor Lucy, describing your marriage and your trust, do I not know you!</t4478> <t4479>Ah, Madam Mina, good women recount their lives in a way that angels could read, day by day, hour by hour, minute by minute; and we, men who wish to learn, carry within us things like the eyes of angels.</t4479> <t4480>Your husband has a noble nature, and you are noble too, because you trust, and trust cannot exist where there is a bad nature.</t4480> <t4481>And your husband - tell me about him.</t4481> <t4482>Is he well?</t4482> <t4483>Has all that fire passed, is he strong and vigorous?”</t4483> <t4484>Here I saw an opportunity to consult him about Jonathan, and so I said:</t4484>
<t4485>“She was almost completely healed, but she was quite shaken by Mr. Hawkins' death.”</t4485> <t4486>He interrupted here:</t4486>
<t4487>“Ah, yes, I know, I know.</t4487> <t4488>I read your last two letters.”</t4488> <t4489>I continued my words:</t4489>
<t4490>“I think this has shaken him up because he experienced some kind of shock while he was in the city last Thursday.”</t4490> <t4491>“A shock, you say, and so soon after the brain fever!</t4491> <t4492>This is not good.</t4492> <t4493>What kind of shock was it?</t4493><t4494>”</t4494>
<t4495>“She thought she saw someone who reminded her of something terrible, someone who reminded her of the event that caused brain fever.”</t4495> <t4496>And here, all that was happening seemed to have rapidly taken hold of me.</t4496> <t4497>The feeling of pity I had for Jonathan, the horror he experienced, all that frightening mystery in his diary, and the fear that had since been incubating within me; all of it came crashing down on me in great turmoil.</t4497> <t4498>I think I was in a hysterical state, because I threw myself to my knees and raised my hands towards the Doctor, begging him to heal my husband.</t4498> <t4499>He took my hands, lifted me up, and placed me on the couch, sitting beside me; he took my hand in his and oh, with infinite sweetness, he said:</t4499>
<t4500>“My life is a desolate, lonely one, and so busy that I have not had much time to devote to friendships; but since I have been called here by my friend John Seward, I have met such good people, seen such nobility, that I feel the loneliness of my life -which had grown with my advancing age- more than ever.</t4500> <t4501>I came here with infinite respect for you and believe that you give hope concerning good women who, with their lives and truths, can provide good lessons to the children of the future -this is a hope that, even if it is not what I was seeking, there are still women who can make life happy.</t4501> <t4502>I am pleased, pleased that I can be of use to you here; because if your husband suffers, he suffers within the scope of my field of special experiences.</t4502> <t4503>I promise you, I will do everything in my power -everything to make his life strong and manly, and yours happy- with pleasure.</t4503> <t4504>Now, you must eat.</t4504> <t4505>You are overly excited and perhaps overly anxious.</t4505> <t4506>Your husband Jonathan would not want to see you looking so pale, and it would not be beneficial for him to see things he does not like in the person he loves.</t4506> <t4507>That is why, for his sake, you must eat and smile.</t4507> <t4508>You have told me everything about Lucy, so let us not speak of her anymore, so as not to upset us.</t4508> <t4509>I will stay in Exeter tonight because I want to think long and hard about what you have told me, and after thinking, if you allow, I will ask you questions.</t4509> <t4510>Then you will tell me, as best as you can, about your husband Jonathan's problem, but not yet.</t4510> <t4511>Now you must eat; later you will tell me everything.</t4511><t4512>”</t4512>
<t4513>After lunch, when we returned to the living room, he said to me:</t4513>
<t4514>“Now tell me everything about him.”</t4514> <t4515>When it came to talking to this big, educated man, I began to fear that he would think of me as a weak fool and Jonathan as crazy - that diary is so strange - and I hesitated to continue my words.</t4515> <t4516>But he was so sweet, so kind, and he had promised to help, and moreover, I trusted him, so I said:</t4516>
<t4517>“Dr. Van Helsing, what I have to tell you now is so strange that you must not mock either me or my husband.</t4517> <t4518>Since yesterday, I have been in the grip of doubts; you must be kind to me and not think I am foolish for believing in some very strange things, even a little.”</t4518> <t4519>Both his demeanor and his words reassured:</t4519>
<t4520>"Ah, my dear, if you knew how strange the matter that brought me here is, you would be the one mocking."</t4520> <t4521>"No matter how strange it is, I have learned not to belittle people's beliefs."</t4521> <t4522>"I try to be open-minded; it is not the ordinary elements of life that destroy open-mindedness, but the strange things, the unusual things, the things that make one doubt whether they are sane or insane."</t4522><t4523>"</t4523>
<t4524>“Thank you, thank you a thousand times!</t4524> <t4525>You have taken a great burden off my mind.</t4525> <t4526>If you permit, I will give you a document to read.</t4526> <t4527>It is a long text, but I have typed it out.</t4527> <t4528>It will tell you about the troubles of Jonathan and myself.</t4528> <t4529>A copy of the diary he kept while abroad, documenting everything that happened to him.</t4529> <t4530>I dare not say anything about it; read it yourself and decide.</t4530> <t4531>And then, when I see you, perhaps you will have the kindness to tell me what you think.</t4531><t4532>”</t4532>
<t4533>When I gave her the documents, she said, "I promise, if you allow me, I will come and see you and your husband as early as I can in the morning."</t4533><t4534></t4534>
<t4535>“Jonathan will be here at half past eleven; you should come to have lunch with us and you will see him then; you can catch the 3.34 fast train that will take you to Paddington before eight o'clock.”</t4535> <t4536>He was surprised by this information I gave about the trains without thinking; he doesn't know that I have memorized all the train schedules going to and coming from Exeter to help Jonathan in case he needs to hurry.</t4536> <t4537></t4537>
<t4538>So, he took the documents with him and left, and here I am sitting and thinking - I don't know what I'm thinking about.</t4538>
<t4539>Letter from Van Helsing to Ms. Harker (handwritten)</t4539>
<t4540>September 25, evening time</t4540>
<t4541>Dear Madam Mina,</t4541>
<t4542>I read your husband's amazing journal.</t4542> <t4543>You can sleep without any doubt.</t4543> <t4544>Even though it is strange and frightening, what is written is true!</t4544> <t4545>I swear on my life.</t4545> <t4546>For others, the situation might be worse; but for you and your husband, there is nothing to fear.</t4546> <t4547>He is a noble person; and based on my experiences with men, I can tell you that someone like him who climbed down that wall and entered that room - yes, twice - will not be harmed by a recurrence of the shock.</t4547> <t4548>His brain and heart are in good condition; I swear to this even without seeing him; so, be at ease.</t4548> <t4549>I will have many other questions to ask him.</t4549> <t4550>I feel blessed for coming to see you today because I suddenly learned so much that I am once again fascinated - more fascinated than ever and I need to think.</t4550>
<t4551>Your most loyal friend</t4551>
<t4552>ABRAHAM VAN HELSING</t4552>
<t4553>letter from Ms. Harker to Van Helsing</t4553>
<t4554>September 25, 6 PM.</t4554> <t4555>30</t4555>
<t4556>Dear Dr. Van Helsing,</t4556>
<t4557>Thank you thousands of times for your kind letter that lifted a great burden from my mind.</t4557> <t4558>But still, if this is true, what terrifying things are happening in the world, and if that man, that monster, is really in London, how dreadful it is!</t4558> <t4559>I am afraid to think.</t4559> <t4560>As I write these lines, I received a telegram from Jonathan saying that he left Launceston at 6:25 PM and will be here at 10:18 PM, so I shouldn't be afraid tonight.</t4560> <t4561>Therefore, instead of having lunch with us tomorrow, if it is not too early for you, could you please come for breakfast at eight in the morning?</t4561> <t4562>If you are in a hurry, you can take the 10:30 train that will take you to Paddington by 2:35.</t4562> <t4563>Do not reply to this letter, so if I do not hear from you, I will understand that you will come for breakfast.</t4563>
<t4565>Believe me, your faithful and grateful friend</t4565>
<t4566>MINA HARKER</t4566>
<t4567>Jonathan Harker's journal</t4567>
<t4568>September 26 - I thought I would never write in this journal again, but the time has come.</t4568> <t4569>When I came home last night, Mina had prepared dinner; after the meal, she told me about Van Helsing's visit and that she had given him copies of two journals, expressing her deep concern for me.</t4569> <t4570>She showed me a letter from the Doctor, stating that everything written in my journal was true.</t4570> <t4571>This made me feel like a completely new man.</t4571> <t4572>What was breaking me down was the doubt about the reality of all these events.</t4572> <t4573>I felt inadequate, in the dark, and insecure.</t4573> <t4574>But now that I know the truth, I am not afraid - not even of the Count!</t4574> <t4575>So, he had finally succeeded in his plan to come to London, and the person I saw was him.</t4575> <t4576>He had rejuvenated, but how?</t4576> <t4577>If he was as Mina described, Van Helsing would be the one to unmask the Count and track him down.</t4577> <t4578>Mina and I stayed up late discussing this matter from beginning to end.</t4578> <t4579>Mina is getting dressed, and in a minute or two, I will stop by the hotel to bring Van Helsing here...</t4579>
<t4580>I think he was surprised to see me.</t4580> <t4581>When I entered the room he was in and introduced myself, he grabbed me by the shoulder, held my face towards the light, and after examining me carefully, he said:</t4581>
<t4582>“But Madam Mina told me that you were ill and had a shock.”</t4582> <t4583>It was amusing that this polite and strong-faced old man referred to my wife as “Madam Mina.”</t4583> <t4584>I smiled and replied:</t4584>
<t4585>“I was sick, I had a seizure; but you have already healed me.</t4585><t4586>”</t4586>
<t4587>“But how?</t4587><t4588>”</t4588>
<t4589>“With the letter you wrote to Mina last night.</t4589> <t4590>I was in doubt; then everything took on an air of unreality and I was confused about what to trust, even the findings of my own senses.</t4590> <t4591>Not knowing what to trust, I didn't know what to do; therefore, I had to immerse myself in work, continuing the habit I had acquired throughout my life until now.</t4591> <t4592>This habit was no longer benefiting me and I didn't trust myself.</t4592> <t4593>Doctor, you cannot know what it is like to doubt everything, even yourself.</t4593> <t4594>No, you cannot; with eyebrows like yours, you cannot know this.”</t4594> <t4595>He seemed pleased and smiled as he responded to me:</t4595>
<t4596>"So, you are an expert in physiognomy."</t4596> <t4597>"With each passing hour, I am learning new things here."</t4597> <t4598>"I am gladly coming to breakfast with you; oh, sir, forgive the praise of an old man, but you are blessed with your wife." I could listen to him praise Mina for a whole day, so I just nodded and remained silent.</t4598>
<t4599>“Oh, one of the women whom God has shaped with His own hands to show us other men and women that there can be a heaven we can go to, and that there can be light here on earth as well.</t4599> <t4600>So sincere, so sweet, so noble, so free from selfishness - this, let me tell you, is very important in an age as skeptical and selfish as ours.</t4600> <t4601>And you, sir - I have read all the letters written to poor Miss Lucy; some of them mentioned you, so I knew you before knowing others; but I learned your true character last night.</t4601> <t4602>You will give me your hand, won't you?</t4602> <t4603>Come, let us be friends for life.</t4603><t4604>”</t4604>
<t4605>We shook hands, it was so sincere, so delicate that my throat tightened.</t4605>
<t4606>“Now,” he said, “may I ask for a little more help from you?</t4606> <t4607>There is a big task I need to accomplish, and the first step is learning.</t4607> <t4608>You can help me here.</t4608> <t4609>Can you tell me what happened before your journey to Transylvania?</t4609> <t4610>Later, I might ask for a bit more help, in a different way; but for now, this much is enough.</t4610><t4611>”</t4611>
<t4612>"Look, sir," I said, "is what you need to do related to the Count?</t4612><t4613>"</t4613>
<t4614>“Yes,” he said solemnly.</t4614>
<t4615>“Then, I am wholeheartedly with you.</t4615> <t4616>Since you will be leaving on the 10:30 train, you won't have time to read them; but I will bring the stack of papers.</t4616> <t4617>You can take them with you and read them on the train.</t4617><t4618>”</t4618>
<t4619>After breakfast, I saw him off at the station.</t4619> <t4620>As we parted, he said:</t4620>
<t4621>“Maybe, if I summon you, you will come to the city and bring Madam Mina as well.</t4621><t4622>”</t4622>
<t4623>"We can both come whenever you want," I said.</t4623>
<t4624>I had brought the morning newspapers and the previous night's London newspapers, and while we were waiting for the train to depart, he flipped through the papers as we talked at the window of the carriage.</t4624> <t4625>Suddenly, his eyes seemed to catch on one of them, the Westminster Gazette—I recognized it by its color—and he turned pale.</t4625> <t4626>Muttering to himself, he began to read: “My God!</t4626> <t4627>My God! So soon!</t4627> <t4628>So soon!”</t4628> <t4629>At that moment, I don't think he remembered me.</t4629> <t4630>Just then, the whistle blew and the train started moving.</t4630> <t4631>This brought him back to his senses, and leaning out of the window and waving his hand, he said: “Love to Madam Mina; I will write to you as soon as I can.</t4631><t4632>”</t4632>
<t4633>Dr. Seward's journal</t4633>
<t4634>September 26 - Indeed, there is no such thing as an end.</t4634> <t4635>It hasn't even been a week since I said "the end" and here I am making a fresh start again or continuing the same record.</t4635> <t4636>Until this afternoon, I hadn't needed to think about what was happening.</t4636> <t4637>Renfield, from any perspective, is more sane than ever.</t4637> <t4638>He had already made considerable progress with the fly business; he recently started on the spider series as well; so he wasn't causing me any trouble.</t4638> <t4639>I received a letter from Arthur written on Sunday, and from this letter, I understand that he is coping perfectly with what he has been through.</t4639> <t4640>Quincey Morris is with him, which is a great help, as he is a great source of morale.</t4640> <t4641>Quincey also wrote a line, and from him, I learned that Arthur is starting to regain his old vitality; thus, I was relieved about this matter.</t4641> <t4642>As for me, I was sitting down to my work with the enthusiasm I once had; thus, I could honestly say that the wound left by poor Lucy was beginning to heal.</t4642> <t4643>But all the wounds have reopened; only God knows what the end will be.</t4643> <t4644>I think Van Helsing himself believes he knows, but each time he only lets slip just enough to arouse curiosity.</t4644> <t4645>He went to Exeter yesterday and stayed there all night.</t4645> <t4646>He returned today and almost literally burst into my room around half-past five, thrusting last evening's Westminster Gazette into my hand.</t4646>
<t4647>Standing back with his arms crossed, he asked, "What do you say to this?"</t4647>
<t4648>I glanced through the newspaper because I really didn't understand what he meant; but he took the newspaper from my hand and pointed to a paragraph about children being lured away and abducted in Hampstead.</t4648> <t4649>This didn't mean much to me until I came to the part describing the wounds made by small punctures in their throats.</t4649> <t4650>An idea came to my mind and I looked up.</t4650> <t4651>"Well?" he said.</t4651> <t4652>"Like poor Lucy's."</t4652><t4653>"</t4653>
<t4654>“So, what do you make of this?</t4654><t4655>”</t4655>
<t4656>“Only that the causes of these two events are connected.</t4656> <t4657>Whatever harmed Lucy is the same thing that harmed them.”</t4657> <t4658>I didn't quite understand the answer:</t4658>
<t4659>“This is indirectly true, if not directly.</t4659><t4660>”</t4660>
<t4661>“What do you mean, Professor?” I asked.</t4661> <t4662>I was inclined to take his seriousness a bit lightly -because after all, four days of rest and relief from burning, nerve-wracking anxieties help restore one's cheerfulness- but seeing his face brought me to my senses.</t4662> <t4663>I had never seen him more stern than this (even in the midst of our despair over poor Lucy) until today.</t4663>
<t4664>“Tell me!” I said.</t4664> <t4665>“I can't guess.</t4665> <t4666>I don't know what to think and I don't have any data to make an assumption.</t4666><t4667>”</t4667>
<t4668>"So, are you telling me, my friend John, that you have no suspicions regarding the cause of poor Lucy's death; despite not only the events but also the numerous hints I've given?"</t4668><t4669>"</t4669>
<t4670>“Lucy died from a nervous breakdown following a large amount of blood loss.</t4670><t4671>”</t4671>
<t4672>“What about blood loss?”</t4672> <t4673>I shook my head from side to side to indicate no.</t4673> <t4674>He took a step forward and sat down next to me, continuing to speak:</t4674>
<t4675>“You are a smart person, my friend John; you reason well and have a bold mind; but you are very prejudiced.</t4675> <t4676>You neither allow your eyes to see nor your ears to hear, and anything outside your daily life has no importance to you.</t4676> <t4677>Don't you believe that there are some things that exist even if you can't understand them, that some people see things that others cannot?</t4677> <t4678>But there are old and new things that people should not see with their eyes, because these people know what others have told them - or think they know.</t4678> <t4679>Ah, the flaw of our science is that it wants to explain everything; if it doesn't explain, it says there is nothing to explain.</t4679> <t4680>But every day we see new beliefs developing around us that consider themselves new; but in fact, these are old beliefs trying to appear new - just like the lovely ladies at the opera.</t4680> <t4681>I suppose you don't believe in matter transfer now.</t4681> <t4682>No?</t4682> <t4683>Nor in materialization.</t4683> <t4684>No? Nor in spirits.</t4684> <t4685>No? Nor in thought reading.</t4685> <t4686>No?</t4686> <t4687>Nor in hypnotism...</t4687><t4688>”</t4688>
<t4689>“Yes,” I said, “Charcot proved it very well.”</t4689> <t4690>He smiled as he continued: “So, that subject has settled within you.</t4690> <t4691>Yes? And of course, then you know how it works and you can trace it to the soul of the patient influenced by the great Charcot -unfortunately no longer with us- and his thoughts.</t4691> <t4692>No?</t4692> <t4693>Then, my friend John, should I conclude that you have only accepted the truth and allowed the gap between the proposition and the result to settle within you?</t4693> <t4694>No?</t4694> <t4695>Then tell me -because I study the brain- how is it that you accept hypnotism but reject thought reading.</t4695> <t4696>Let me tell you this, my friend, today in the science of electricity, things are being done that the very men who discovered electricity -who until recently would have been burned for witchcraft- would consider heretical.</t4696> <t4697>There are always mysteries in life.</t4697> <t4698>Why did Methuselah live nine hundred years and Old Parr one hundred and sixty-nine years, but that poor Lucy, with the blood of four men coursing through her veins, could not live even one day?</t4698> <t4699>Because if she had lived one more day, we could have saved her.</t4699> <t4700>Do you know the entire mystery of life and death?</t4700> <t4701>Do you know comparative anatomy in all its aspects and can you explain why some people have animalistic traits and others do not?</t4701> <t4702>Can you tell me why some spiders die young and quickly, while a large spider can live for centuries in the tower of an old Spanish church, growing until it comes down to drink the oil from all the church lamps?</t4702> <t4703>Can you explain to me why in the Pampas, yes, and in other places too, there are bats that come at night to open the veins of cattle and horses and drain them; how on some islands of the Western seas, there are bats that hang from trees all day, described by those who see them as giant walnuts or silkworm cocoons, and then fly over sailors sleeping on deck because it’s hot, and then - and then in the morning those sailors are found dead, as white as Miss Lucy?</t4703><t4704>”</t4704>
<t4705>“My God, Professor!” I said, recoiling.</t4705> <t4706>“Are you trying to tell me that Lucy was bitten by this kind of bat and that such a thing happened in the nineteenth century in London?”</t4706> <t4707>He waved his hand for me to be silent and continued his words:</t4707>
<t4708>“Can you tell me why the turtle lives longer than human generations; why the elephant continues to live long enough to see dynasties, and why the parrot does not die from anything other than a cat or dog bite or another disease?</t4708> <t4709>Can you tell me why, throughout the ages and in every corner of the world, some people believe in the existence of a few people who, if allowed, live forever - the existence of men and women who cannot die?</t4709> <t4710>We know - because science has confirmed this fact - that there are toads trapped in rocks for thousands of years; trapped in a tiny hole that has held them since the youth of the world.</t4710> <t4711>Can you tell me how the Indian fakir makes himself die and gets buried, has his grave sealed, corn planted over it, harvested, and then planted and harvested again, and then, when people come and lift the unbroken seal, the Indian fakir is found lying there, not dead, and gets up and walks among them as before?”</t4711> <t4712>I interrupted him here.</t4712> <t4713>I was beginning to feel dizzy; my mind was so filled with the oddities of nature and possible impossibilities that my imagination was inadequate in the face of it.</t4713> <t4714>I had a vague idea that he was lecturing me as he had done long ago in the study room in Amsterdam; but back then, he would tell me what he was teaching me, so that the subject would always be on my mind.</t4714> <t4715>But now, he was not helping me, yet I wanted to grasp what he was saying, and so I said:</t4715>
<t4716>“Professor, allow me to be your favorite student once again.</t4716> <t4717>Tell me your thesis so that I can apply your knowledge to this argument while you continue your speech.</t4717> <t4718>Right now, I am jumping from topic to topic like a madman, not like an intelligent person following a thought in my mind.</t4718> <t4719>I feel like a novice who, without knowing where he is going, continues to blindly move forward, stumbling from one clump of grass to another and falling into a swamp in the fog.</t4719><t4720>”</t4720>
<t4721>“This is a good image,” he said.</t4721> <t4722>“Alright, I will tell you.</t4722> <t4723>My argument is this: I want you to believe.</t4723><t4724>”</t4724>
<t4725>“What should I believe in?</t4725><t4726>”</t4726>
<t4727>“To believe in things you can't believe.</t4727> <t4728>Let me explain with an example: Once, I heard of an American who explained faith as ‘the thing that makes us believe in things we know are not true’.</t4728> <t4729>I am particularly following this man.</t4729> <t4730>He wants to say that we should be open-minded and not let a small piece of reality, like a small stone in front of a freight car, prevent us from seeing a larger reality.</t4730> <t4731>First, we learn the small truth.</t4731> <t4732>Great! We hold onto it and value it, but at the same time, we should not let it think that it is the entire reality of the universe.</t4732><t4733>”</t4733>
<t4734>“So, you want me not to let a view from the past affect the way my mind perceives a strange subject.</t4734> <t4735>Have I understood your lesson correctly?”</t4735> <t4736>“Ah, you are still my favorite student.</t4736> <t4737>It is worth teaching you.</t4737> <t4738>Now that you are ready to understand, you have taken the first step on the path to understanding.</t4738> <t4739>So, do you think that the small holes in the children's necks were made by the same thing that made the hole in Miss Lucy's neck?</t4739><t4740>”</t4740>
<t4741>"I guess so!"</t4741><t4742>"</t4742>
<t4743>He stood up and said solemnly:</t4743>
<t4744>“Then you are mistaken.</t4744> <t4745>Ah, I wish it were so.</t4745> <t4746>But alas! No! Much worse, much, much worse.</t4746><t4747>”</t4747>
<t4748>“For God's sake, Professor Van Helsing, what are you trying to say?” I exclaimed.</t4748>
<t4749>With a reckless movement, he dropped himself into the chair and, resting his elbows on the table, covered his face with his hands as he spoke:</t4749>
<t4750>“Miss Lucy made them!</t4750><t4751>”</t4751>
<t4752>XV</t4752>
<t4753>Dr. Seward's journal (continued)</t4753>
<t4754>For a while, I was under the influence of pure anger; it felt as if the Doctor had struck Lucy's face while she was alive.</t4754> <t4755>I slammed the table hard and stood up, saying: "Dr. Van Helsing, are you mad?" He looked up at me, and somehow the kindness on his face immediately calmed me.</t4755> <t4756>"I wish I were!" he said.</t4756> <t4757>"Madness is much easier to bear than such a truth.</t4757> <t4758>Oh, my friend, why do you think I beat around the bush, why did it take me so long to tell you something so simple?</t4758> <t4759>Because I hated you and have hated you all my life?</t4759> <t4760>Because I wanted to make you suffer?</t4760> <t4761>Because I wanted to take revenge, albeit late, for the time you saved my life, rescuing me from a horrific death?</t4761> <t4762>Oh, no!</t4762><t4763>"</t4763>
<t4764>“Forgive me,” I said.</t4764> <t4765>He continued speaking: “My friend, because I wanted to be gentle while giving you this bad news, because I know you love that very sweet lady.</t4765> <t4766>But even now, I don't expect you to believe it.</t4766> <t4767>It is so difficult to immediately accept an abstract truth that we always doubt the possibility of such a thing when we have believed it to be ‘impossible’; accepting such a concrete truth, especially when it concerns Miss Lucy, is even harder.</t4767> <t4768>I will go to prove it tonight.</t4768> <t4769>Will you dare to come with me?</t4769><t4770>”</t4770>
<t4771>This surprised me.</t4771> <t4772>A person does not want to prove such a truth; Byron had excluded the class of jealousy from this.</t4772>
<t4773>And he is proving the fact he despises the most.</t4773> <t4774>42</t4774>
<t4775>Seeing my hesitation, he said:</t4775>
<t4776>“The logic is simple: This time, it's not the logic of a madman jumping from one tuft of grass to another in a foggy swamp.</t4776> <t4777>If it's not true, then proving it will be a relief; at worst, it won't cause any harm.</t4777> <t4778>If it's true! Ah, here's the horror; but the horror itself will serve my purpose, because it will require a bit of faith.</t4778> <t4779>Come, let me tell you my proposal: First, we will now go and see that child in the hospital.</t4779> <t4780>Since my friend Dr. Vincent from North Hospital, where the newspapers say the child is staying, and you were in the same class in Amsterdam, I assume he is your friend too.</t4780> <t4781>Even if he wouldn't allow two friends to do this, he will allow two scientists to see his case.</t4781> <t4782>We won't tell him anything, we'll just say that we want to find out what's going on.</t4782> <t4783>And then...</t4783><t4784>”</t4784>
<t4785>"And then what?</t4785><t4786>"</t4786>
<t4787>He took a key out of his pocket and held it up in the air.</t4787> <t4788>"And then, you and I will spend the night in the churchyard where Lucy lies.</t4788> <t4789>This key is the key to the grave.</t4789> <t4790>I got it from the gravedigger to give to Arthur.</t4790><t4791>"</t4791>
<t4792>My heart was sinking because I felt that there was a terrifying exam ahead of us.</t4792> <t4793>But there was nothing I could do, so I gathered all my courage and said that we needed to act quickly because the afternoon was approaching...</t4793>
<t4794>We found the child awake.</t4794> <t4795>He had slept and eaten a little; his condition was entirely improving.</t4795> <t4796>Dr. Vincent removed the bandage from his neck and showed us the punctures on his skin.</t4796> <t4797>There was no doubt about the similarity with those on Lucy's neck.</t4797> <t4798>They were smaller and the edges looked fresher; that was all.</t4798> <t4799>We asked Vincent what he attributed these to; he said it must be an animal bite, perhaps a rat bite; but for his part, he tended to think it was one of the bats that are found in large numbers in the northern heights of London.</t4799> <t4800>“Among so many harmless species,” he said, “it could be a wild type from the more harmful species of the South.</t4800> <t4801>A sailor might have brought it home and it managed to escape; or a young bat might have been freed from the zoo or mated with a vampire bat there and caused a breeding.</t4801> <t4802>Such things happen, you know.</t4802> <t4803>Just ten days ago, a wolf escaped from the zoo and I believe it was tracked in this direction.</t4803> <t4804>A week later, children in all the alleys around here were playing nothing but Little Red Riding Hood in Heath until the fear of this ‘beautiful lady’ emerged.</t4804> <t4805>Even this little child, when he woke up this morning, asked the nurse, ‘Can I go?’</t4805> <t4806>When the nurse asked him why he wanted to go, he said he wanted to play with the ‘beautiful lady’.</t4806><t4807>”</t4807>
<t4808>“I hope,” said Van Helsing, “that when you send the child home, you will warn the parents to watch him closely.</t4808> <t4809>These kinds of desires to escape are the most dangerous things; if the child had stayed out one more night, it would have been fatal.</t4809> <t4810>But in any case, I don't think you will leave him for a few more days, will you?</t4810><t4811>”</t4811>
<t4812>“Of course, I will keep it for at least a week; if the wound does not heal, even longer.</t4812><t4813>”</t4813>
<t4814>Our visit to the hospital took much more time than we expected, and the sun had set before we left.</t4814> <t4815>When Van Helsing saw how dark it had become, he said:</t4815>
<t4816>“There is no need to hurry.</t4816> <t4817>It's later than I thought.</t4817> <t4818>Come, let's find a place to eat and then hit the road.</t4818><t4819>”</t4819>
<t4820>We had our dinner at an inn called "Jack Straw's Castle" along with a group of cyclists and another group making noise cheerfully.</t4820><t4821>We left the inn and set out on our way around ten o'clock.</t4821><t4822>At that time, the weather was very dark, and the lamps scattered here and there made the darkness even greater as we moved out of each of their spheres of influence.</t4822><t4823>The Professor had clearly noted the way we were to go, because he was moving forward without hesitation; but as for me, I was quite confused about where we were.</t4823><t4824>As we progressed, we encountered fewer and fewer people, until we were surprised to meet a mounted policeman on his usual suburban patrol.</t4824><t4825>Finally, we reached the wall of the churchyard and climbed it.</t4825><t4826>With some difficulty - because it was very dark and the whole place felt very unfamiliar to us - we found the Westenra family tomb.</t4826><t4827>The Professor took out the key and opened the creaking door; he gently but quite unconsciously stood back and gestured with his hand for me to enter ahead of him.</t4827><t4828>There was a delightful irony in his making such a polite choice even in such a dreadful situation.</t4828><t4829>My friend quickly followed me in and, after making sure that the lock was not spring-loaded but the falling type, carefully closed the door.</t4829><t4830>If it had been otherwise, we would have been in a difficult situation.</t4830><t4831>Then he fumbled in his bag and, taking out a matchbox and a piece of candle, began to light it.</t4831><t4832>The tomb had looked ugly and frightening enough even in daylight and adorned with fresh flowers; but now, a few days after the ceremony, as the white parts of the flowers turned to rust color and the green parts to brown, with spiders and insects regaining their usual dominance, the stones faded with time and the concrete covered with dust, the rusty, moldy iron, the stained brass and silver plating reflecting the weak light of the candle, the effect was much more pitiable and miserable than could be imagined.</t4832><t4833>It irresistibly reflected the thought that the only thing that could pass away was not life - the life of the living.</t4833>
<t4834>Van Helsing began to work with a certain system.</t4834> <t4835>He found Lucy's grave by holding the candle so that he could read the plaques on the graves, and holding the spermaceti in such a way that it dripped in white pieces and solidified the moment it touched the metal.</t4835> <t4836>He searched his bag once more and took out his screwdriver.</t4836>
<t4837>"What are you going to do?" I asked.</t4837>
<t4838>“I will open the coffin.</t4838> <t4839>You still need to be convinced.”</t4839> <t4840>He immediately started unscrewing the bolts and finally lifted the lid to reveal the lead lining underneath.</t4840> <t4841>The sight affected me almost unbearably.</t4841> <t4842>This situation seemed like an insult to the dead, as if stripping someone of their clothes while they slept; in fact, I held Van Helsing's hand to stop him.</t4842> <t4843>The only thing he said was, “You will see,” and rummaged through his bag again to take out a fine wire saw.</t4843> <t4844>With a swiftness that frightened me, he brought the screwdriver down on the lead and made a small hole, just large enough for the tip of the saw to enter.</t4844> <t4845>I had expected gas to escape from the week-old corpse.</t4845> <t4846>We doctors, who have to be aware of the risks of our work, are accustomed to such things, so I stepped back towards the door.</t4846> <t4847>But the Professor did not stop for a moment; he cut a slit about sixty centimeters long along one side of the lead coffin with the saw, then cut the opposite side of the coffin, and then one of the other sides.</t4847> <t4848>He tilted the lifted part towards the foot of the coffin, holding it, and signaled for me to look by holding the candle towards the opened part.</t4848>
<t4849>I approached and looked.</t4849> <t4850>The coffin was empty.</t4850>
<t4851>This was definitely a surprise for me and it shocked me, but Van Helsing was not affected at all by what he saw.</t4851> <t4852>Now, he was more certain of his reasoning than ever and thus was encouraged to continue his task.</t4852> <t4853>“Are you satisfied now, my friend John?” he asked.</t4853>
<t4854>While responding to her, I felt the stubborn argumentative side of my personality being activated:</t4854>
<t4855>“I am convinced that Lucy's body is not in the coffin; but this proves only one thing.</t4855><t4856>”</t4856>
<t4857>“Well, what is it, my friend John?</t4857><t4858>”</t4858>
<t4859>“That he is not here.</t4859><t4860>”</t4860>
<t4861>“Good logic,” he said, “up to a certain point.</t4861> <t4862>But how do you explain - can you explain - his not being here?</t4862><t4863>”</t4863>
<t4864>“Maybe a grave robber,” I guessed.</t4864> <t4865>“Some of the undertaker's men might have stolen it.”</t4865> <t4866>I felt like I was talking foolishly, but still, this was the only plausible reason I could come up with.</t4866> <t4867>The professor sighed.</t4867> <t4868>“Ah, very well!” he said, “We need to find more evidence.</t4868> <t4869>Come with me.</t4869><t4870>”</t4870>
<t4871>He placed the lid back on the coffin, gathered all his belongings, and put them in his bag, turned off the light, and placed the candle in the bag as well.</t4871> <t4872>We opened the door and stepped outside.</t4872> <t4873>He closed and locked the door behind us.</t4873> <t4874>As he handed me the key, he asked, “Should you keep it?</t4874> <t4875>It would be better if you were sure,” he said.</t4875> <t4876>I laughed as I told him I would keep the key - I must say, it wasn't a very cheerful laugh.</t4876> <t4877>“The key is nothing,” I said; “There could be spares; after all, it wouldn't be hard to pick such a lock.”</t4877> <t4878>He said nothing, but put the key in his pocket.</t4878> <t4879>Then, while he watched one side of the churchyard, he told me to watch the other side.</t4879> <t4880>I took my position behind a yew tree and saw him advance until the gravestones and trees between us completely obscured the Doctor's dark silhouette from view.</t4880>
<t4881>It was a desolate night watch.</t4881> <t4882>Right after I took my place, a distant clock struck twelve, then one and two.</t4882> <t4883>I was very cold, my courage was broken; I was angry at the Professor for getting me into such a job, and at myself for following him and coming here.</t4883> <t4884>I was too cold and sleepy to look around eagerly and pay attention, but not so sleepy as to shake his confidence in me; therefore, I was having a completely boring and miserable time.</t4884>
<t4885>When I turned around, I suddenly thought I saw something like a white line moving between two yew trees in the farthest corner of the churchyard from the grave; at the same time, a dark mass moved from the direction of the Professor and hurriedly went that way.</t4885> <t4886>Then I also started moving, but I had to go around the gravestones and the graves surrounded by railings; I was stumbling over the graves.</t4886> <t4887>The sky was cloudy, and somewhere in the distance, an early rooster crowed.</t4887> <t4888>A little further away, behind a spaced-out row of juniper trees marking the path to the church, a white, barely discernible shape was swiftly heading towards the grave.</t4888> <t4889>The grave itself was hidden behind the trees, and I couldn't see where the silhouette I had seen disappeared to.</t4889> <t4890>At the place where I first saw the white shape, I heard a fresh rustle, and when I went there, I found the Professor holding a small child in his arms.</t4890> <t4891>When he saw me, he lifted the child towards me and said:</t4891>
<t4892>“Are you satisfied now?</t4892><t4893>"</t4893>
<t4894>"No," I said in a manner that I felt was aggressive.</t4894>
<t4895>"Don't you see the child?"</t4895><t4896>"</t4896>
<t4897>“Yes, this is a child, but who brought him here?</t4897> <t4898>And is he injured?” I asked.</t4898>
<t4899>“We will see,” said the Professor, and with a sudden movement, we left the churchyard with the child in the Professor's arms.</t4899>
<t4900>When we moved a little away, we went into the woods, lit a match, and looked at the child's throat.</t4900> <t4901>There wasn't a single scratch or mark.</t4901>
<t4902>With a triumphant attitude, I asked, "Was I right?"</t4902>
<t4903>“We arrived just in time,” said the Professor gratefully.</t4903>
<t4904>Now we had to decide what to do with the child and we exchanged ideas on this matter.</t4904> <t4905>If we took him to the police station, we would have to account for our actions during the night; at the very least, we would have to explain how we found the child.</t4905> <t4906>Therefore, we finally decided to take the child to Heath and leave him in a place where the police would definitely find him upon hearing their arrival; then, we would head home as quickly as possible.</t4906> <t4907>Everything went smoothly.</t4907> <t4908>We heard a policeman walking slowly at the edge of Hampstead Heath and laid the child on the road, waiting and watching until the policeman saw the child while shining his flashlight here and there.</t4908> <t4909>We heard the policeman's cry of surprise and then quietly walked away from there.</t4909> <t4910>By chance, we found a car near the "Spanish Inn" and went to the city.</t4910>
<t4911>I can't sleep, so I'm writing this.</t4911> <t4912>But I should try to sleep for a few hours because Van Helsing will drop by at noon to pick me up.</t4912> <t4913>He insists that I join him on another expedition.</t4913>
<t4914>September 27 - By the time we found the right opportunity for our venture, it was two o'clock.</t4914> <t4915>The funeral ceremony at noon had completely ended, and the last members of the grieving community were lazily drifting away; when we carefully looked from behind the maple grove, we saw the sexton locking the door behind them.</t4915> <t4916>At that moment, we realized that if we wanted, we could move freely here until morning; but the Professor said we would need at most an hour.</t4916> <t4917>Once again, I was seized by that dreadful feeling where the efforts of imagination to grasp the reality of events seemed futile; I was aware of the legal dangers we would face as a result of this most unholy task.</t4917> <t4918>Moreover, I felt that all of this would be in vain.</t4918> <t4919>Opening a lead coffin to see if a woman who had died almost a week ago was really dead was very grotesque; now, even though we had witnessed with our own eyes that the coffin was empty, opening it again seemed the height of folly.</t4919> <t4920>But I shrugged my shoulders and stood silently because Van Helsing had a way of proceeding on his own path, no matter who opposed him.</t4920> <t4921>He took the key, opened the grave, and with a noble gesture, signaled for me to enter first.</t4921> <t4922>It was not as frightening as the night before, but oh, when the daylight entered, it looked indescribably worse.</t4922> <t4923>Van Helsing moved towards Lucy's coffin, and I followed him.</t4923> <t4924>He bent down and pried open the lead layer again; at that moment, I was filled with great astonishment and horror.</t4924>
<t4925>Lucy was lying in the coffin almost exactly as we had seen her the night before her funeral.</t4925> <t4926>If such a thing were possible, she possessed an even more radiant beauty than ever; I couldn't believe that the person before me was dead.</t4926> <t4927>Her lips were red, even redder than before, and there was a slight color in her cheeks.</t4927>
<t4928>I said to Van Helsing, "Is this a trick?"</t4928>
<t4929>"Are you convinced now?" said the Professor in response; as he spoke, he reached out and pulled back the dead lips, making my hair stand on end, and revealed the white teeth.</t4929>
<t4930>“Look,” he continued, “look, they are sharper than ever.</t4930> <t4931>With this one and this one,” -he touched one of his canine teeth and the one below it- “small children can be bitten.</t4931> <t4932>Do you believe now, my friend John?”</t4932> <t4933>Once again, a desire to oppose him hostilely arose within me.</t4933> <t4934>I could not accept such a devastating thought as he proposed; thus, I began to speak with an attempt at argument that I was ashamed of even as I said it:</t4934>
<t4935>“Easily, it could have been placed here after last night.</t4935><t4936>”</t4936>
<t4937>“Really?</t4937> <t4938>If so, by whom?</t4938><t4939>”</t4939>
<t4940>“I don't know.</t4940> <t4941>Someone did it.</t4941><t4942>”</t4942>
<t4943>“But still, she has been dead for a week.</t4943> <t4944>In this time, many people could not look like this.”</t4944> <t4945>I had no response to this, so I remained silent.</t4945> <t4946>Van Helsing did not seem to notice my silence; yet he showed neither resentment nor triumph.</t4946> <t4947>He was carefully looking at the dead woman's face, lifting her eyelids to look at her eyes and once again parting her lips to examine her teeth.</t4947> <t4948>And then he looked at me and said:</t4948>
<t4949>“There is something here different from all the records; here is a dual life that is not ordinary.</t4949> <t4950>While she was not herself, while she was walking in her sleep, she was bitten by a vampire -ah, you shuddered; you do not know this, my friend John, but you will learn everything later- and the best time for the vampire to suck more blood was when she was unconscious.</t4950> <t4951>She died while she was not herself and became the Undead while she was not herself again.</t4951> <t4952>In this respect, she is different from the others.</t4952> <t4953>Usually, the Undead sleep at home,” -while speaking, he gestured with his arm to indicate a broad area to show what “home” meant for a vampire- “their faces reveal what they truly are, but this girl, who was so sweet in the past, returns to the void of ordinary dead when she is not the Undead.</t4953> <t4954>There is no malice here, see, that’s why it is hard for me to kill her while she sleeps.”</t4954> <t4955>This chilled my blood and the realization that I accepted Van Helsing’s theories began to dawn on me; but if Lucy was truly dead, what was so terrifying about the thought of killing her?</t4955> <t4956>The Professor lifted his head and looked at me, and clearly saw the change on my face because he said almost cheerfully:</t4956>
<t4957>“Ah, so now you believe me, do you?</t4957><t4958>”</t4958>
<t4959>I replied: "Don't pressure me like this.</t4959> <t4960>I want to agree.</t4960> <t4961>How will you do this bloody job?</t4961><t4962>"</t4962>
<t4963>“I will cut off your head, fill your mouth with garlic, and drive a stake through your body.</t4963><t4964>”</t4964>
<t4965>The thought of the body of the woman I love being cut and shaped in this way made my hair stand on end.</t4965> <t4966>But still, this feeling was not as strong as I expected.</t4966> <t4967>In fact, my hair stood on end in the presence of this being, this Undead as Van Helsing called it, and I was beginning to feel disgusted by it.</t4967> <t4968>Was it possible for love to be entirely subjective or completely objective?</t4968>
<t4969>I waited for quite a while for Van Helsing to start, but he seemed to be lost in thought.</t4969> <t4970>After a moment, he snapped his bag shut and said:</t4970>
<t4971>“I thought about it and made my decision on what would be best.</t4971> <t4972>If I now follow only my inclination about what needs to be done, other things will arise, and among these things, there are those we do not yet know, which are a thousand times worse.</t4972> <t4973>This is simple.</t4973> <t4974>Even though it is a matter of time, it has not yet taken a life; to act now would be to forever remove the danger from him.</t4974> <t4975>But then we might need Arthur; how will we explain this to him?</t4975> <t4976>If you, who saw the wounds on Lucy’s neck and the very similar wounds on the child’s neck in the hospital; if you, who saw the empty coffin last night and today saw a woman inside who, apart from her skin becoming even rosier and more beautiful a week after her death, has not changed at all - if you know this and the white silhouette that brought the child to the churchyard last night and still do not believe despite your own senses, how can I expect Arthur, who knows none of this, to believe?</t4976> <t4977>While dying, he suspected me when I kept him from Lucy’s kiss.</t4977> <t4978>I know he forgave me for doing things that would prevent his farewell with a wrong thought; with an even more wrong thought, he might think this woman was buried alive; worst of all, he might think we killed her.</t4978> <t4979>Then he will respond to us, saying that it was our thoughts that killed her; thus, he will always be very unhappy.</t4979> <t4980>Yet he will never be sure, and this is the worst part.</t4980> <t4981>And from time to time, he will think his beloved was buried alive, and this thought will color his dreams with terrible images of the great pains Lucy suffered; again, he will think that we might be right and, as a result, that his beloved is the Undead.</t4981> <t4982>No! I told him once before, and since then, I have learned a lot.</t4982> <t4983>Now, knowing that this is entirely true, I know a hundred thousand times better that he must pass through the bitter waters to reach the sweet waters.</t4983> <t4984>Poor man, he must live through an hour that will darken the face of heaven for him; then, he will act with good intentions, and we will be able to bring him peace.</t4984> <t4985>I have made my decision.</t4985> <t4986>Let’s go.</t4986> <t4987>Return to your home, your mental hospital for tonight, and make sure everything is in order.</t4987> <t4988>As for me, I will spend this night here, in the churchyard, in my own way.</t4988> <t4989>Tomorrow night at ten, you will come to me at the Berkeley Hotel.</t4989> <t4990>I will also send word for Arthur to come and for that nice young American man who gave his blood.</t4990> <t4991>Then, we will all have work to do.</t4991> <t4992>I will go with you to Piccadilly and eat there, for I must return here before sunset.</t4992><t4993>”</t4993>
<t4994>Thus, we locked the tomb, left there, and climbed over the churchyard wall—which was no great task—and drove back to Piccadilly.</t4994>

<t4999>September 27</t4999>
<t5000>My friend John,</t5000>
<t5001>I am leaving this note in case something happens.</t5001><t5002>I am going alone to keep watch in that churchyard.</t5002><t5003>I am pleased that Miss Lucy, who is Undead, will not leave tonight and thus will be more eager tomorrow night.</t5003><t5004>Therefore, I will place some things she will not like - garlic and a cross - and thus seal the door of the tomb.</t5004><t5005>As an Undead, she is still young and will avoid these.</t5005><t5006>Moreover, these are only to prevent her from getting out; if she wants to get in, they may not work; for then the Undead are desperate and must encounter the least resistance, no matter what.</t5006><t5007>I will be nearby from sunset to after sunrise and will learn whatever there is to be learned.</t5007><t5008>I am not afraid for Miss Lucy or of her; but the other one who turned her into an Undead now has the power to seek her grave and take refuge.</t5008><t5009>From mr Jonathan's experiences and from how cunningly he played with us for Miss Lucy's life and made fools of us all that time, I know that the Undead are strong in many ways.</t5009><t5010>They always have the strength of twenty people; within Miss Lucy is the combined strength of us four who gave her our power.</t5010><t5011>He can also gather his wolves and who knows what else.</t5011><t5012>Therefore, if he comes there tonight, he will find me; but no one else - until it is too late.</t5012><t5013>But he may not try here.</t5013><t5014>There is no reason for him to come; there would be more to hunt in the churchyard where the Undead woman sleeps and an old man keeps watch than in this hunting ground.</t5014>
<t5015>That's why, just in case, I'm writing this letter.</t5015> <t5016>Take the papers next to it, Harker's journal and the other papers; read them and then find this great Undead, cut off his head and burn his heart or stake him so that the world may be rid of him.</t5016>
<t5017>If we don't meet again, goodbye.</t5017>
<t5018>VAN HELSING</t5018>
<t5019>Dr. Seward's journal</t5019>
<t5020>September 28 - How a good night's sleep does wonders for a person.</t5020> <t5021>Yesterday, I was almost willing to accept Van Helsing's monstrous thoughts; but now these thoughts stand before me, horrifically, as an insult to common sense.</t5021> <t5022>I have no doubt that he believes in all this.</t5022> <t5023>I wonder if he might have lost his mind in some way.</t5023> <t5024>Surely, there must be some logical explanations for all these mysterious things.</t5024> <t5025>Is it possible that the Professor himself has done this?</t5025> <t5026>He has such an extraordinary mind that if he has gone mad, he would perfectly carry out his purpose related to a fixed idea.</t5026> <t5027>I don't want to think about it, and indeed, seeing Van Helsing as mad would be almost as astonishing as the other situation; but in any case, I will observe Van Helsing carefully.</t5027> <t5028>Maybe, I can find something that will shed light on the mystery.</t5028>
<t5029>September 29, morning.</t5029> <t5030>- Last night, just before ten o'clock, Arthur and Quincey came to Van Helsing's room; he told us everything he wanted us to do, but while doing so, he was particularly addressing Arthur, as if all our wills were concentrated on him.</t5030> <t5031>He began his words by saying that he hoped all of us would come with him, "Because," he said, "there is a serious duty to be fulfilled there.</t5031> <t5032>Surely you were surprised by my letter, weren't you?”</t5032> <t5033>This question was directly addressed to Lord Godalming.</t5033>
<t5034>"Yes.</t5034> <t5035>More than anything, it left me bewildered.</t5035> <t5036>Recently, there has been so much trouble around my house that I can live without any more of it.</t5036> <t5037>Quincey and I talked about it; but the more we talked, the more confused we got; speaking for myself, I can say that I am so indecisive that I cannot attribute any meaning to anything so far.</t5037><t5038>"</t5038>
<t5039>"Me too," said Quincey briefly and concisely.</t5039>
<t5040>“Ah,” said the Professor, “then you are both closer to the beginning than my friend John, who had to come a long way back even to start.</t5040><t5041>”</t5041>
<t5042>It was clear that he had noticed I had reverted to my old skeptical mindset without me having to say a single word.</t5042> <t5043>Then, turning to the other two with intense seriousness, he said:</t5043>
<t5044>“Tonight, I seek your permission to do something that I believe will be good.</t5044> <t5045>I know this is asking a lot, and only when you learn what I propose to do will you understand how much I am asking.</t5045> <t5046>Therefore, may I ask you to promise me something while you still know nothing?</t5046> <t5047>That way, even if you are angry with me for a while - I cannot hide from myself the possibility that this might happen - you will not blame yourself for anything in the future.” “Still, this is straightforward,” Quincey interrupted.</t5047> <t5048>“I vouch for the Professor.</t5048> <t5049>I do not quite understand his purpose, but I swear he is honest; that is enough for me.</t5049><t5050>”</t5050>
<t5051>“I thank you, sir,” said Van Helsing proudly.</t5051> <t5052>“I have had the honor of counting you as a reliable friend, and this statement is very important to me.”</t5052> <t5053>He extended his hand, and Quincey shook it.</t5053>
<t5054>Then, Arthur spoke:</t5054>
<t5055>"Dr. Van Helsing, as the Scots say, I never like 'blind bargaining'; I cannot make such a promise in matters concerning my honor as a gentleman and my faith as a Christian.</t5055> <t5056>If you can assure me that your purpose does not violate either of these, I will agree immediately; by my head, even if I do not understand what you mean, I will agree to it.</t5056><t5057>"</t5057>
<t5058>"I understand your limitations," said Van Helsing, "and the only thing I ask of you is that if you feel compelled to condemn any of my actions, you first think it over carefully and believe that my action does not violate your conditions."</t5058><t5059>"</t5059>
<t5060>“Accepted!” said Arthur, “This situation seems fair.</t5060> <t5061>And now that the pourparlers43 have ended, may I ask what we are going to do?</t5061><t5062>”</t5062>
<t5063>“I want you to come with me to the churchyard at Kingstead, I want you to come with me there secretly.</t5063><t5064>”</t5064>
<t5065>Arthur's face fell in astonishment:</t5065>
<t5066>"To the place where poor Lucy is buried?"</t5066> <t5067>The professor nodded.</t5067> <t5068>Arthur continued: "Well, where will we go there?</t5068><t5069>"</t5069>
<t5070>"To the grave!" Arthur jumped to his feet.</t5070>
<t5071>“Professor, are you serious, or is this a monstrous joke?”</t5071> <t5072>“Forgive me, I see that you are serious.”</t5072> <t5073>He sat down again, but I could see that he sat sternly and proudly, like someone who does not compromise on their values.</t5073> <t5074>There was silence until he asked once more:</t5074>
<t5075>“So, what will we do in the grave?</t5075><t5076>”</t5076>
<t5077>“We will open the coffin.</t5077><t5078>”</t5078>
<t5079>“This is too much!” he said again, rising in anger.</t5079> <t5080>“I am willing to show patience for anything reasonable, but this disrespect to the grave of my beloved...”</t5080> <t5081>He almost seemed to choke with anger.</t5081> <t5082>The professor looked at him with pity.</t5082>
<t5083>“If I could protect you from pain, my dear friend,” he said, “God knows I would do it.</t5083> <t5084>But tonight we must tread the thorny paths, otherwise, those feet you love so much will have to walk the fiery roads forever!</t5084><t5085>”</t5085>
<t5086>Arthur, with a pale, expressionless face, looked and said: "Be careful, sir, be careful!</t5086><t5087>"</t5087>
<t5088>"Wouldn't it be good to listen to what I have to say?" said Van Helsing.</t5088> <t5089>"Then, at least, you will have learned the limits of my purpose.</t5089> <t5090>Shall I continue?</t5090><t5091>"</t5091>
<t5092>“That is quite reasonable,” Morris interjected.</t5092>
<t5093>After a momentary hesitation, Van Helsing, clearly making an effort, continued his words:</t5093>
<t5094>“Miss Lucy is dead; isn't she?</t5094> <t5095>Yes! Then no harm can come to her.</t5095> <t5096>But if she is not dead...</t5096><t5097>”</t5097>
<t5098>Arthur jumped to his feet.</t5098>
<t5099>“Oh my God!” he cried.</t5099> <t5100>“What do you mean?</t5100> <t5101>Was a mistake made; was he buried alive?”</t5101> <t5102>He groaned with a pain that even hope could not soften.</t5102>
<t5103>"I didn't say he was alive, my child; I never thought so.</t5103> <t5104>I will go no further than to say he is Not Dead.</t5104><t5105>"</t5105>
<t5106>"Not Dead?</t5106> <t5107>Isn't he alive?</t5107> <t5108>What do you mean?</t5108> <t5109>Is all this a nightmare, or what is this?</t5109><t5110>"</t5110>
<t5111>“There are mysteries that people can only speculate about, and can only partially solve from age to age.</t5111> <t5112>Believe me, we are on the brink of such a mystery right now.</t5112> <t5113>But I didn't do it.</t5113> <t5114>Can I cut off dead Miss Lucy's head?</t5114><t5115>”</t5115>
<t5116>“For God's sake! No!” cried Arthur in a storm of rage.</t5116> <t5117>“I would not accept it even if you gave me the worlds to cut and dissect her dead body.</t5117> <t5118>Dr. Van Helsing, you are testing my patience excessively.</t5118> <t5119>What have I done to you that you are torturing me like this?</t5119> <t5120>What did that poor, sweet girl do to you that you want to desecrate her grave in this way?</t5120> <t5121>Are you mad for saying such things, or am I mad for listening to them?</t5121> <t5122>Do not dare to think of such disrespect any longer; I will not allow you to do anything.</t5122> <t5123>It is my duty to protect her grave from insult, and I will do it!</t5123><t5124>”</t5124>
<t5125>Van Helsing, who had been sitting all this time, stood up and said with a serious and stern expression:</t5125>
<t5126>“Lord Godalming, I too have a duty to fulfill, a duty to others, to you, to the dead, and with God's help, I will do it!</t5126> <t5127>Now all I ask of you is to come with me, watch, and listen; if in the future, when I make the same request, you are not even more willing than I am to fulfill it, then I will do my duty; whatever I think it may be.</t5127> <t5128>And then, to safeguard the wishes of my Lord, I will be at your service, ready to account for myself whenever and wherever you desire.”</t5128> <t5129>His voice cracked a little, and he continued with a tone full of compassion:</t5129>
<t5130>“But I beg you, do not come at me in anger.</t5130> <t5131>In my long life, often filled with unpleasant and heart-wrenching actions, I have never had a duty as heavy as this one.</t5131> <t5132>Believe me, when the time comes for you to change your opinion of me, a single glance from you will erase all this sorrowful time, because I will do everything a person can to protect you from sadness.</t5132> <t5133>Just think about it.</t5133> <t5134>Why would I burden myself with such a great task and such great sorrow?</t5134> <t5135>I came here from my own country to do everything I can for your well-being; first to please my friend John, and then to help the sweet, young lady whom I began to love.</t5135> <t5136>I gave her - I am ashamed to tell you this much, but I say it delicately - what you gave her: I gave her the blood in my veins, like you, who is not her lover, but only her doctor and friend.</t5136> <t5137>I gave her my days and nights - before death, after death, and even now, if my death will benefit her, she will have it willingly.”</t5137> <t5138>He said this with a very serious, sweet pride, and Arthur was deeply moved.</t5138> <t5139>He held the old man's hand and said in a broken voice:</t5139>
<t5140>“Ah, it's hard to think about this and I can't understand it; but at least I will go with you and wait.</t5140><t5141>”</t5141>
<t5142>16</t5142>
<t5143>Dr. Seward's journal (continued)</t5143>
<t5144>When we climbed over the low wall and entered the churchyard, it was only a quarter past twelve.</t5144> <t5145>Despite the moonlight occasionally shining through the cracks between the heavy clouds drifting across the night sky, it was dark.</t5145> <t5146>In some way, we all walked close to each other; Van Helsing was a bit ahead of us, showing us the way.</t5146> <t5147>As we approached the grave, I looked at Arthur carefully, because I feared that approaching a place filled with such sorrowful memories would upset him; but he was holding up well.</t5147> <t5148>I concluded that the mystery of the task at hand somehow prevented his grief.</t5148> <t5149>The professor unlocked the door and, seeing that we all had a natural hesitation for various reasons, resolved the issue by entering first himself.</t5149> <t5150>We others followed him and he closed the door behind us.</t5150> <t5151>Then he lit a dim light and pointed to the coffin.</t5151> <t5152>Arthur advanced hesitantly; Van Helsing said to me: "You were here with me yesterday.</t5152> <t5153>Was Miss Lucy's body in the coffin yesterday?</t5153><t5154>"</t5154>
<t5155>“Yes.” The Professor turned to the others, saying: “You hear, and yet there is someone who still does not believe me.”</t5155> <t5156>Then, he took his screwdriver and lifted the lid of the coffin.</t5156> <t5157>Arthur watched with a very pale face but silently; when the lid was lifted, he stepped forward.</t5157> <t5158>It was clear that he did not know the coffin was lead, or at least he had not thought about it.</t5158> <t5159>When he saw the crack in the lead, blood rushed to his face for a moment, but then it withdrew just as quickly; so much so that he remained pale and white as a sheet; he was still silent.</t5159> <t5160>Van Helsing threw back the lead flap and we all recoiled as we looked inside the coffin.</t5160>
<t5161>The coffin was empty!</t5161>
<t5162>For a few minutes, no one spoke.</t5162> <t5163>The silence was broken by Quincey Morris:</t5163>
<t5164>"Professor, I vouched for you.</t5164> <t5165>The only thing I want is what you have to say; normally, I wouldn't ask for such a thing - I wouldn't cast doubt on your honor; but this is a mystery beyond all honor and dishonor.</t5165> <t5166>Is this your work?</t5166><t5167>"</t5167>
<t5168>“I swear by everything I hold sacred that I neither carried it nor touched it.</t5168> <t5169>This is what happened: Two nights ago, my friend Seward and I came here - with good intentions, believe me.</t5169> <t5170>We opened that sealed coffin and found it empty, just as it is now.</t5170> <t5171>Then we waited and saw something white coming through the trees.</t5171> <t5172>The next day, we came again during the day and there it was lying.</t5172> <t5173>Isn't that right, my friend John?</t5173><t5174>”</t5174>
<t5175>“Yes.</t5175><t5176>”</t5176>
<t5177>“We arrived just in time that night.</t5177> <t5178>A small child had gone missing again, and thank God, we found him unharmed among the graves.</t5178> <t5179>Yesterday, I came here before sunset because the Undead move at sunset.</t5179> <t5180>I waited here all night until the sun rose, but I saw nothing.</t5180> <t5181>This was very reasonable because I had covered the edges of the door with garlic, which the Undead cannot stand, and other things they avoid.</t5181> <t5182>No one came out last night, so before sunset tonight, I removed my garlic and other things from there.</t5182> <t5183>And thus, we found this coffin empty.</t5183>
<t5184>But listen to me patiently.</t5184> <t5185>So far, very strange things have happened.</t5185> <t5186>Wait with me outside, unseen and unheard, much stranger things will happen.</t5186> <t5187>Therefore,” -here he closed the cover of his lamp- “now outside.”</t5187> <t5188>He opened the door, walked behind us, closed the door behind him, and we went out in single file.</t5188>
<t5189>Ah! After the grave, the night air felt fresh and pure.</t5189> <t5190>How sweet it was to see the passing clouds and the moonlight filtering through the swiftly moving clouds - like the joys and sorrows in human life; how sweet it was to breathe the clean air untouched by death and decay; how humanizing it was to see the red glow in the sky behind the hill and to hear that muffled hum, a sign of the great city's life.</t5190> <t5191>Everyone was very serious in their own way and was coping with what had happened.</t5191> <t5192>Arthur was silent, trying to grasp the purpose and spiritual meaning of this mystery.</t5192> <t5193>I was quite patient and seemed half-inclined to set aside doubt and accept the conclusions Van Helsing had reached.</t5193> <t5194>Quincey Morris was in a calm state of someone who accepts everything and accepts everything with a cool courage, along with the things he must risk.</t5194> <t5195>Since he couldn't smoke, he had cut himself a large piece of chewing tobacco and was chewing it.</t5195> <t5196>As for Van Helsing, he was busy with a special task.</t5196> <t5197>First, he took out a thin, biscuit-like thing carefully wrapped in a white napkin from his bag; then he took two handfuls of a white substance that looked like dough or paste.</t5197> <t5198>He crumbled the biscuit finely and mixed it with the substance in his hand.</t5198> <t5199>Then he took this and, after rolling it into thin strips, began to place them in the gaps between the door and the door frame of the grave.</t5199> <t5200>I was a bit surprised by this and, being close to him, asked what he was doing.</t5200> <t5201>Arthur and Quincey had also come close to us because they were curious too.</t5201> <t5202>The professor replied:</t5202>
<t5203>“I am closing the grave so that the Not Dead cannot enter.</t5203><t5204>”</t5204>
<t5205>“And is this thing you put here going to provide it?” asked Quincey.</t5205> <t5206>“Oh my God! Is this a game?</t5206><t5207>”</t5207>
<t5208>“Yes.</t5208><t5209>”</t5209>
<t5210>"What is it that you are using?"</t5210> <t5211>This time the question came from Arthur.</t5211> <t5212>Van Helsing answered, lifting his hat respectfully:</t5212>
<t5213>“Communion bread.</t5213> <t5214>I brought it from Amsterdam.</t5214> <t5215>I had my sins forgiven.”</t5215> <t5216>This was a response that surprised even our most skeptical member, and each of us individually felt that it was impossible to display distrust in the face of such a serious purpose as the Professor's, a purpose that could use even the most sacred objects.</t5216> <t5217>In a respectful silence, we took our places near the grave, but in spots where we could hide from the eyes of any approaching person.</t5217> <t5218>I pitied the others, especially Arthur.</t5218> <t5219>Due to my previous visits, my inexperience in this vigil of horror had ended; but still, even I, who had rejected the evidence until an hour ago, felt my heart sinking.</t5219> <t5220>The graves had never seemed so terrifyingly white to me; the cypress, yew, or juniper had never appeared so much like the embodiment of funeral sorrow; the trees or grass had never rustled and swayed so ominously; a tree branch had never creaked so mysteriously, and the howling dogs in the distance had never sent such mournful signals into the night.</t5220>
<t5221>There was a long silence, a great, painful void, and then a sharp "shh" sound came from the Professor.</t5221> <t5222>He pointed to a spot, and below, from the direction of the distant badger-tree road, we saw a white figure approaching - a barely discernible white figure holding something black on its chest.</t5222> <t5223>The figure stopped, and at that moment, a beam of moonlight filtered through the passing clouds; we were astonished to see a woman with dark hair, shrouded in burial clothes, revealed before our eyes.</t5223>
<t5224>We couldn't see his face because he was bent over something we understood to be a fair-haired child.</t5224><t5225>There was a pause, and then a sharp, short scream was heard, like that of a small child in sleep or a dog dreaming by the fire.</t5225><t5226>We were just about to leap forward when we stopped at the warning hand of the Professor, whom we could see because he was standing behind the yew tree; then, as we watched him, the white figure began to move forward again.</t5226><t5227>It was now close enough for us to see clearly, and the moonlight was still in place.</t5227><t5228>My heart turned to ice, and I could hear Arthur breathing heavily, for we had recognized the figure of Lucy Westenra.</t5228><t5229>What we saw was Lucy Westenra, but how she had changed.</t5229><t5230>Her sweetness had turned into diamond-like hardness, heartless cruelty, and her purity into wanton lust.</t5230><t5231>Van Helsing stepped forward, and following his movement, we also advanced; we lined up at the entrance of the tomb.</t5231><t5232>Van Helsing raised his lamp and lifted its cover; thanks to the intense light falling on her face, we could see that Lucy's lips were crimson with fresh blood and that the blood had trickled down her chin, staining her shroud of fine linen.</t5232>
<t5233>We shuddered with horror.</t5233> <t5234>I could see that even Van Helsing's nerves were frayed in the flickering light.</t5234> <t5235>Arthur was standing beside me, and if I hadn't held his arm for support, he would have fallen.</t5235>
<t5236>Lucy -I call this thing in front of us "Lucy" because it had taken her shape- retreated with an angry growl like a cat caught off guard when she saw us; then her eyes roamed over us.</t5236> <t5237>These were Lucy's eyes in shape and color; but instead of the pure, gentle pupils we knew, there were sinful and hellfire-filled eyes.</t5237> <t5238>At that moment, what remained of my love turned into hatred and disgust; if she needed to be killed then, I could have done it with ruthless pleasure.</t5238> <t5239>When she looked, her eyes sparkled with malevolent light and her face was crowned with a lascivious smile.</t5239> <t5240>Oh God! How it made my hair stand on end to see this!</t5240> <t5241>With a careful movement, she threw the child she had been diligently holding to her chest to the ground with a heartless motion reminiscent of a demon, and as she did so, she growled at him like a dog growling at a bone.</t5241> <t5242>The child let out a high-pitched scream and lay on the ground moaning.</t5242> <t5243>There was a cold-bloodedness in the act itself that caused Arthur to groan; when Lucy approached him with open arms and a wanton smile, Arthur retreated and hid his face behind his hands.</t5243>
<t5244>But she was still moving forward with a seductive and sensual grace:</t5244>
<t5245>"Come to me, Arthur."</t5245> <t5246>"Leave the others and come to me."</t5246> <t5247>"My arms are open to you."</t5247> <t5248>"Come and let us find peace together."</t5248> <t5249>"Come, my husband, come!"</t5249><t5250>"</t5250>
<t5251>In her voice, there was a devilish sweetness that resonated in our minds - similar to the ringing sound you hear when you strike a glass - even though we knew the words were meant for someone else.</t5251> <t5252>As for Arthur, he seemed to be under a spell; he removed his hands from his face and opened his arms wide.</t5252> <t5253>Lucy had just leapt towards him when Van Helsing sprang forward and held his small, golden cross aloft between the two of them.</t5253> <t5254>Lucy recoiled from the cross and suddenly, with a contorted, rage-filled face, she darted past the Professor as if she wanted to enter the grave.</t5254>
<t5255>But about half a meter from the door, he stopped as if caught by an irresistible force.</t5255> <t5256>Then he turned, and his face was revealed in the light of the clearly shining moon and the lamp whose light did not waver with Van Helsing's iron nerves.</t5256> <t5257>I had never seen such a malevolent astonishment on a face before, and I believe that such a sight will never again be seen by mortal eyes.</t5257> <t5258>The beautiful color of his skin came to life, his eyes seemed to spark with the fires of hell; his forehead wrinkled as if the folds of his flesh were Medusa's snakes, and his beautiful, bloody mouth opened squarely like the masks used by the Greeks and Japanese in religious plays.</t5258> <t5259>If it is possible for a human face to mean death -if looks could kill- we saw it at that moment.</t5259>
<t5260>And thus, for what seemed like an eternity of a full half minute, he remained between the cross held aloft and the sacred barrier at the entrance.</t5260> <t5261>Van Helsing turned to Arthur and broke the silence:</t5261>
<t5262>"Answer me, oh my friend!</t5262> <t5263>Shall I continue with my work?</t5263><t5264>"</t5264>
<t5265>Arthur threw himself onto his knees and responded, hiding his face in his hands:</t5265>
<t5266>“Do what you want, my friend; do what you want.</t5266> <t5267>Such a horror can never be seen again!” And he groaned with all his soul.</t5267> <t5268>Quincey and I moved towards him at the same time and held him by the arms.</t5268> <t5269>We heard the sound of the lamp being extinguished in Van Helsing’s hand; approaching the tomb, he took some of the holy symbols he had previously placed there from the gaps.</t5269> <t5270>When the professor stepped back, we stared in horror and amazement as we saw the woman's material body, which at that moment seemed as real as ours, pass through a crack only a knife's edge could fit through.</t5270> <t5271>We all sighed with relief when we saw the professor calmly placing the paste on the edges of the door again.</t5271>
<t5272>When this task was completed, the Professor lifted the child from the ground and said:</t5272>
<t5273>“Now come, my friends; we can't do anything else until tomorrow.</t5273> <t5274>There is a funeral here at noon, so we will come here shortly after the ceremony.</t5274> <t5275>The friends of the deceased will have left by two o'clock, and when the sexton locks the door, we will stay here.</t5275> <t5276>Then, there will be other tasks to do; but not like tonight.</t5276> <t5277>As for this little one, he hasn't been harmed much and will be healed by tomorrow evening.</t5277> <t5278>Let's leave him here, where the police will find him, just like last night, and then let's go home.” Approaching Arthur, he said:</t5278>
<t5279>“My friend Arthur, you have gone through a bitter trial, but later, when you look back, you will see how necessary it was.</t5279> <t5280>Now you are in bitter waters, my child.</t5280> <t5281>By this time tomorrow, with God's permission, you will have passed these trials and tasted sweet waters; so do not mourn too much.</t5281> <t5282>Until then, I will not ask you to forgive me.</t5282><t5283>”</t5283>
<t5284>Arthur and Quincey came home with me, and we tried to cheer each other up along the way.</t5284> <t5285>We had left the child in a safe place and were tired; therefore, we slept in a manner that was almost like real sleep.</t5285>
<t5286>September 29, night.</t5286> <t5287>- Just before midnight, the three of us - Arthur, Quincey Morris, and I - visited the Professor.</t5287> <t5288>It was strange to notice that we were all dressed in black unanimously.</t5288> <t5289>Of course, Arthur was dressed in black because he was in deep mourning; but the rest of us had dressed this way instinctively.</t5289> <t5290>We arrived at the churchyard at half-past one and wandered around, staying out of sight of the officials, so that when the gravediggers finished their work and the sexton, believing everyone had left, locked the door, the entire place was left to us.</t5290> <t5291>Instead of his small black bag, Van Helsing had a leather bag that resembled a long cricket bag; it was evidently very heavy.</t5291>
<t5292>After being left alone and hearing the last footsteps leaving the churchyard fade away on the road, we silently, as if commanded for this purpose, followed the Professor to the grave.</t5292> <t5293>He unlocked the door, and we entered, closing the door behind us.</t5293> <t5294>Then he took a lamp out of his bag and lit it; then he took out two candles from his bag, which he lit and melted the ends to stick them on the other coffins so they could provide enough light to work.</t5294> <t5295>When he lifted the lid of Lucy's coffin again, we all looked inside -Arthur was trembling like a leaf- and saw the corpse lying there with all its dead beauty.</t5295> <t5296>But there was no love in my heart; in my heart, there was no feeling other than disgust for that horrible Thing that took the shape of Lucy without her soul.</t5296> <t5297>I could even see Arthur's face hardening as he looked into the coffin.</t5297> <t5298>After a while, he said to Van Helsing:</t5298>
<t5299>“Is this really Lucy's body or just a demon that has taken her form?</t5299><t5300>”</t5300>
<t5301>“It is his body, but still not him.</t5301> <t5302>But wait a little; you will see what he was in the past and what he is now.</t5302><t5303>”</t5303>
<t5304>What we saw, lying there, was like Lucy's nightmare; sharp teeth, bloody, lustful lips - which sent shivers down one's spine - all that sexual and non-spiritual appearance that seemed like a diabolical imitation of Lucy's sweet innocence.</t5304> <t5305>Van Helsing, with all his usual methodicalness, began to take various things out of his bag and prepare them for use.</t5305> <t5306>First, a soldering iron and some solder, then a small gas lamp that burned with fierce blue flames and emitted gas when lit in a corner of the grave, then his surgical knives which he left within reach, and finally a round wooden stake about seven or eight centimeters wide and approximately ninety centimeters long.</t5306> <t5307>The tip of the stake had been hardened and sharpened by being roasted in the fire.</t5307> <t5308>Along with this stake came a heavy hammer, similar to those used in homes to break large pieces in the coal shed.</t5308> <t5309>To me, the Doctor's preparation for any task is enlightening and invigorating, but the effect on Arthur and Quincey was to throw them into a kind of horror.</t5309> <t5310>But both of them kept their courage and stood quietly.</t5310>
<t5311>When everything was ready, Van Helsing began to speak:</t5311>
<t5312>"Before we start, let me tell you this; what we are about to do comes from the knowledge and experience of everyone who has studied the power of the ancients and the Undead.</t5312> <t5313>When they transform into the Undead, the curse of immortality comes with it; they cannot die, but they must live through the ages, adding new victims to their ranks and multiplying the world's evils; because those who are hunted and killed by the Undead also turn into the Undead and feed on their own kind.</t5313> <t5314>And thus the circle widens forever, like the ripples created by a stone thrown into water.</t5314> <t5315>My friend Arthur, if you had accepted that kiss from Lucy before she died or if you had kissed her when you opened your arms to her last night, you would have become, as they say in Eastern Europe, a nosferatu44 upon her death and would have continued to create those Undead that fill us with fear.</t5315> <t5316>The career of this very unfortunate lady has just begun.</t5316> <t5317>The condition of those children whose blood she has sucked is not yet very bad; but if Lucy continues to live as an Undead, the children will lose more of their blood and come to her because of the power over them; thus she sucks their blood with her very sinful mouth.</t5317> <t5318>But if she truly dies, then it will all end; the wounds on their throats will disappear and they will return to their games without ever knowing what happened.</t5318> <t5319>But best of all, this thing that is now the Undead will be put to rest as a true dead, and then the soul of that poor lady we love will be free again.</t5319> <t5320>Instead of doing evil at night and degrading herself further by absorbing it during the day, she will take her place beside the other angels.</t5320> <t5321>Therefore, my friend, the hand that delivers the blow to set her free will be a holy hand.</t5321> <t5322>I am willing; but is there no one among us who has more right to it?</t5322> <t5323>Afterwards, in the silence of the night, won't it be a joy to think, 'It was my hand that sent her to the stars, it was the hand of the one who loved her the most; if she had a choice, it would be the hand she would choose among all,'?</t5323> <t5324>Tell me if there is such a person among us.</t5324><t5325>"</t5325>
<t5326>We all looked at Arthur.</t5326> <t5327>He saw what we were doing, saw the infinite kindness suggesting that it should be his hand to bring Lucy back to us not as a sinner, but as a sacred memory; he stepped forward and, despite his hand trembling and his face being as white as snow, he bravely said: “My true friend, I thank you from the very depths of my broken heart.</t5327> <t5328>Tell me what I must do and I will not hesitate!” Van Helsing placed his hand on Arthur’s shoulder and said:</t5328>
<t5329>“Brave young man!</t5329> <t5330>A moment of courage and it will all be over.</t5330> <t5331>This stake needs to be driven into him.</t5331> <t5332>It will be a terrifying, arduous test - do not be deceived about that - but it will be short, and then you will rejoice more than the magnitude of your pain; you will walk out of this ugly grave as if you were walking on air.</t5332> <t5333>But once you start, you must not hesitate.</t5333> <t5334>Just think that we, your true friends, are around you and always praying for you.”</t5334> <t5335>“Go on,” said Arthur in a hoarse voice, “tell me what I need to do.</t5335><t5336>”</t5336>
<t5337>“Take this stake in your left hand, ready to place its tip over his heart, and the mallet in your right hand.</t5337> <t5338>Then we will begin the prayer for the dead - I will read it, the book is right here, and the others will follow me - in the name of God, drive it in so that everything concerning this beloved dead one will be well and the Un-Dead will pass away.</t5338><t5339>”</t5339>
<t5340>Arthur took the stake and hammer, and as soon as his mind was set in motion, his hands did not tremble for a moment.</t5340> <t5341>Van Helsing opened the prayer book and began to read, and Quincey and I followed him as best as we could.</t5341> <t5342>Arthur placed the tip of the stake over the heart; when I looked, I could see the small indentation it made in the flesh.</t5342> <t5343>Then, he struck with all his might.</t5343>
<t5344>The thing in the coffin writhed in agony; from the open, red lips came a disgusting, blood-curdling scream.</t5344><t5345>Its body shook and trembled, twisting and contorting wildly; its sharp white teeth clashed together, cutting its lips until its mouth filled with red foam.</t5345><t5346>But Arthur did not hesitate.</t5346><t5347>As his arm rose and fell without trembling, he drove the merciful stake deeper, even as blood spurted from the shattered heart.</t5347><t5348>His face was resolute, and the expression of holy duty on his face shone; this sight gave us courage, so that our voices seemed to echo in the small tomb chamber.</t5348>
<t5349>And then, the body's writhing and trembling began to subside, and the teeth stopped chattering, the face stopped twitching.</t5349> <t5350>Finally, it lay still.</t5350> <t5351>The horrifying task was over.</t5351>
<t5352>The hammer fell from Arthur's hand.</t5352> <t5353>He staggered, if I hadn't held him, he would have fallen.</t5353> <t5354>Large drops of sweat were bursting from his forehead, and his breath was coming in short, labored gasps.</t5354> <t5355>It had truly been a terrible strain for him; he would never have undertaken this task if something much more than human considerations hadn't compelled him.</t5355> <t5356>For a minute or two, we were all so concerned with him that we didn't even look towards the coffin.</t5356> <t5357>But when we did look at the coffin, a murmur of astonishment came from each of us.</t5357> <t5358>We were looking with such passion that Arthur, who was sitting on the ground, got up and came to look as well; then his face lit up with a strange, satisfied smile that completely dispelled the gloom of horror on his face.</t5358>
<t5359>Now in the coffin, it was not that repulsive Thing we so despised and left to the person most authorized to destroy it, but Lucy as we had seen her in life, with her unique sweetness and purity.</t5359> <t5360>It was true that there were traces of anxiety, pain, and exhaustion as we had seen in life; but all of these were precious to us because they indicated the reality of her as we had once known her.</t5360> <t5361>We all felt that the holy calmness extending over that ravaged face and body like daylight was the earthly sign and symbol of the eternal calm that would reign forever.</t5361>
<t5362>Van Helsing came and put his hand on Arthur's shoulder and said:</t5362>
<t5363>"And now Arthur, my friend, dear young man, have I not been forgiven?"</t5363><t5364></t5364>
<t5365>Arthur's reaction to this terrible tension emerged when he took the old man's hand in his and brought it to his lips:</t5365>
<t5366>“Forgiveness!</t5366> <t5367>God bless you for restoring my lover's soul and bringing me peace.” He placed his hands on the Professor's shoulders and, resting his head on his chest, cried silently for a while as we stood still.</t5367> <t5368>When he lifted his head, Van Helsing said to him:</t5368>
<t5369>“And now, my child, you may kiss him.</t5369> <t5370>If you wish, kiss his dead lips; if he had the choice, he would want this too.</t5370> <t5371>For he is no longer a grinning demon - no longer a vile Thing that would live forever.</t5371> <t5372>He is no longer the Undead of the devil.</t5372> <t5373>His soul is now a true dead one beside God!</t5373><t5374>”</t5374>
<t5375>Arthur bent down and kissed Lucy, then we sent Arthur and Quincey outside the grave; the Professor and I cut the stake so that its end would remain inside the body.</t5375> <t5376>Then, we cut off Lucy's head and filled her mouth with garlic.</t5376> <t5377>We soldered the lead coffin, screwed the lid of the coffin, gathered our belongings, and left the place.</t5377> <t5378>When the Professor locked the door, he gave the key to Arthur.</t5378>
<t5379>The weather outside was pleasant, the sun was shining, the birds were singing, and it was as if all of nature had transitioned to a different pitch.</t5379> <t5380>Everywhere there was joy, happiness, and peace, because for some reason we had all found tranquility and, albeit with a light cheerfulness, we were content.</t5380>
<t5381>Before leaving, Van Helsing said: "Now, my friends, one step of our task, the saddest for us, is completed.</t5381> <t5382>But we have a greater task ahead: to find and crush the source of all our suffering.</t5382> <t5383>I have various clues we can follow; but this is a long and arduous task, filled with danger and pain.</t5383> <t5384>Will you all not help me?</t5384> <t5385>We have learned to believe, all of us - haven't we?</t5385> <t5386>Since this is the case, do we not see our duty?</t5386> <t5387>Yes! And do we not all promise to go to the end?</t5387><t5388>"</t5388>
<t5389>We all shook hands in turn, and thus the promise was made.</t5389> <t5390>Then, as we were moving away, the Professor said: "Two nights from now, you will meet me, and at seven o'clock, we will have dinner with our friend John.</t5390> <t5391>I will also ask two people whom you have not yet met; I will be ready for our work and the developing plan.</t5391> <t5392>My friend John, you are coming home with me because there are many things I need to discuss with you, and you can help me.</t5392> <t5393>I am leaving for Amsterdam tonight, but I will return tomorrow evening.</t5393> <t5394>And then our great quest will begin.</t5394> <t5395>But first, I will have much to say, so you will learn what to do and what to avoid.</t5395> <t5396>Then the promise we made to each other will be reiterated; because we have a dreadful task ahead of us, and once we put our foot to the plow, we must not pull back.</t5396><t5397>"</t5397>
<t5398>XVII</t5398>
<t5399>Dr. Seward's journal (continued)</t5399>
<t5400>When we arrived at the Berkeley Hotel, Van Helsing found a telegram waiting for him:</t5400>
<t5401>I am coming by train.</t5401> <t5402>Jonathan is in Whitby.</t5402> <t5403>Important news.</t5403>
<t5404>Mina Harker</t5404>
<t5405>The professor was very pleased.</t5405> <t5406>“Ah, the wonderful Madam Mina,” he said, “A pearl among women!</t5406> <t5407>She is coming, but I cannot stay.</t5407> <t5408>She must go to your house, my friend John.</t5408> <t5409>You must meet her at the station.</t5409> <t5410>Send her a telegram on the way so she can be prepared.</t5410><t5411>”</t5411>
<t5412>When the telegram was sent, Van Helsing had a cup of tea; while drinking his tea, he mentioned the journal kept by Jonathan Harker while he was abroad and gave me typed copies of both his and Ms. Harker’s journals from Whitby.</t5412> <t5413>“Take these,” he said, “and study them thoroughly.</t5413> <t5414>When I return, you will be familiar with all the facts, so we can start our investigation better.</t5414> <t5415>Keep them safe, because they contain things of great value.</t5415> <t5416>Even though you have had an experience like today, you will need all your faith.</t5416> <t5417>The things described here,” he placed his hand firmly and seriously on the stack of papers as he spoke, "could be the beginning of the end for you, me, and many others, or it might sound like the death knell of the Undead walking the earth.</t5417> <t5418>Please, read them with an open mind and if you have anything to add to what is described here, please do so because it is all important.</t5418> <t5419>You have kept a journal of all these strange events, haven’t you?</t5419> <t5420>Yes! Then, when we come together, we will go over all of this together.”</t5420> <t5421>Then, he prepared to leave and shortly after, went by car to Liverpool Street.</t5421> <t5422>As for me, I set off for Paddington, where I arrived fifteen minutes before the train came.</t5422>
<t5423>After the usual bustle on the arrival platform, the crowd dispersed; I was starting to get anxious that I might have missed my guest, when a cute, petite-looking girl came up to me and, after a brief look, said, "Doctor Seward, isn't it?"</t5423>
<t5424>"And you must be Ms. Harker!" I immediately replied; with that, she extended her hand.</t5424>
<t5425>“I know you from poor dear Lucy's description, but,” he suddenly stopped and his face quickly turned bright red.</t5425>
<t5426>The blush spreading to my cheeks also relieved us both, because it had been a silent answer to his question.</t5426> <t5427>I took his luggage, which included a typewriter, and after sending a telegram to my butler to prepare a living room and bedroom for Ms. Harker, we went to Fenchurch Street by subway.</t5427>
<t5428>We arrived on time.</t5428> <t5429>Of course, she knew this was a mental hospital, but I could see that she couldn't help but shiver slightly when we entered.</t5429>
<t5430>He said that he wanted to come to my study room immediately if possible because he had a lot to tell.</t5430> <t5431>Therefore, while waiting for him now, I am finishing this entry in my phonograph journal.</t5431> <t5432>Despite being open in front of me, I haven't had a chance to look at the documents Van Helsing left for me until now.</t5432> <t5433>I must find something that will catch Ms. Harker's interest so that I can have the opportunity to read these documents.</t5433> <t5434>She doesn't know how valuable time is or what kind of work we have in hand.</t5434> <t5435>I must be careful not to scare her.</t5435> <t5436>Here she comes!</t5436>
<t5437>Mina Harker's diary</t5437>
<t5438>September 29 - After tidying myself up, I went down to Dr. Seward's study.</t5438> <t5439>I paused for a moment at the door because I thought I heard him talking to someone.</t5439> <t5440>But since he was urging me to be quick, I knocked on the door, and upon hearing him say "Come in," I entered the room.</t5440>
<t5441>Apparently, there was no one inside.</t5441> <t5442>He was all alone, and on the table in front of him was something that I understood to be a phonograph from its description.</t5442> <t5443>I had never seen one before, and it intrigued me greatly.</t5443>
<t5444>“I hope I haven't kept you waiting,” I said; “but when I heard you talking and thought someone was with you, I waited at the door.</t5444><t5445>”</t5445>
<t5446>“Ah,” he replied with a laugh, “I was just jotting down something in my journal.</t5446><t5447>”</t5447>
<t5448>“To your journal?” I asked in astonishment.</t5448>
<t5449>“Yes,” he replied.</t5449> <t5450>“I keep it here.”</t5450> <t5451>As he spoke, he placed his hand on the phonograph.</t5451> <t5452>I got very excited about this and blurted out:</t5452>
<t5453>“Hey! But he can even beat this wall!</t5453> <t5454>Can I hear you say something?</t5454><t5455>”</t5455>
<t5456>“Of course,” he replied eagerly, standing up to start the machine.</t5456> <t5457>Then he stopped, and a troubled expression spread across his face.</t5457>
<t5458>"The truth is," he began awkwardly, "I'm only recording this in my journal; and this is entirely - almost entirely - about my cases, it might be inappropriate - I mean, what I'm trying to say is" - he paused, and I tried to help him overcome his embarrassment:</t5458>
<t5459>“You helped take care of Lucy in her final days.</t5459> <t5460>Tell me how she died; I would be very grateful for everything I can learn about her.</t5460> <t5461>She was someone very, very important to me.</t5461><t5462>”</t5462>
<t5463>He answered me with a look of horror on his face, surprising me:</t5463>
<t5464>“Shall I tell you about your death?</t5464> <t5465>It won't happen in this world!” “Why not?” I asked, because a terrible feeling had begun to settle over me.</t5465> <t5466>He hesitated once more, I could see he was trying to come up with an excuse.</t5466> <t5467>Finally, he stammered and said:</t5467>
<t5468>“As you can see, I don't know how to choose a specific part of the journal.”</t5468> <t5469>While speaking, something suddenly occurred to him and with unconscious simplicity, in a different tone of voice and with a child's innocence, he said, “This is really very true, I swear on my honor.</t5469> <t5470>If I'm lying, may I be struck down!”</t5470> <t5471>I couldn't help but smile, and upon seeing this, he made a face.</t5471> <t5472>“This time I gave myself away!” he said.</t5472> <t5473>“But you know, even though I've been keeping a journal for months, it never occurred to me how I would find a specific part if I wanted to look back.”</t5473> <t5474>During this time, I had come to the conclusion that there might be something in the Doctor's journal, who had been taking care of Lucy, that could add to our knowledge about that horrifying Creature, and I bravely said:</t5474>
<t5475>"In that case, Dr. Seward, it would be better if you allowed me to make a copy on the typewriter for you."</t5475> <t5476>He was absolutely pale when he replied:</t5476>
<t5477>"No! No! No! It can't happen in this world, I can't let you learn that horrifying story!"</t5477><t5478></t5478>
<t5479>So it was terrifying, my intuition was right!</t5479> <t5480>For a moment, I thought, and as my eyes wandered around the room unconsciously searching for something or an opportunity that could help me, they landed on the large stack of typed papers on the table.</t5480> <t5481>His eyes caught the look in mine and, without thinking, followed the direction they were pointing.</t5481> <t5482>When he saw the stack of papers, he understood what I meant.</t5482>
<t5483>"You don't know me," I said.</t5483> <t5484>"When you read these papers - the journal I typed and my husband's journal - you will know me better.</t5484> <t5485>For this purpose, I did not hesitate to share all the thoughts in my heart, but of course, you don't know me - you don't know me yet, and at this stage, I shouldn't expect you to trust me this much.</t5485><t5486>"</t5486>
<t5487>Definitely possessing a noble nature, poor Lucy was not mistaken about him.</t5487> <t5488>He stood up and opened the wide drawer filled with boxes of metal tubes covered in black wax, each with numerous holes.</t5488>
<t5489>“You are absolutely right.</t5489> <t5490>I didn't trust you because I didn't know you.</t5490> <t5491>But now I know you, and let me say that I should have known you a long time ago.</t5491> <t5492>I know that Lucy has told you about me, and she has also told me about you.</t5492> <t5493>May I use the only method of compensation I have?</t5493> <t5494>Take these cylinders and listen - the first half dozen are personal things and won't scare you, then you will know me better.</t5494> <t5495>By that time, the meal will be ready.</t5495> <t5496>In the meantime, I will reread some of these documents and understand some things better.”</t5496> <t5497>He carried the phonograph to my living room with his own hands and set it up for me.</t5497> <t5498>Now I will learn some pleasant things, I am sure of it; because it will tell me the other side of a true love story of which I already know one side...</t5498>
<t5499>Dr. Seward's diary</t5499>
<t5500>29 September.</t5500> <t5501>- I was so engrossed in the dreadful journals of Jonathan Harker and his wife that I allowed time to pass without thinking.</t5501> <t5502>When the servant came and announced that dinner was ready, Ms. Harker had not yet come down, so I said, "She is probably tired; let dinner wait for an hour," and continued with my work.</t5502> <t5503>When Ms. Harker came in, I had just finished her journal.</t5503> <t5504>She was in a sweet beauty, but she looked sad and her eyes were red from crying.</t5504> <t5505>For some reason, this affected me greatly.</t5505> <t5506>God knows, I have had many reasons to shed tears lately!</t5506> <t5507>But the soothing effect of tears was denied to me, and now the sight of those sweet eyes glistening with recently shed tears touched my heart directly.</t5507> <t5508>Therefore, I said as gently as I could:</t5508>
<t5509>“I'm afraid I upset you.</t5509><t5510>”</t5510>
<t5511>“Oh, no! You didn't upset me,” he replied, “but rather, I was deeply moved by your pain, more than I can express.</t5511> <t5512>This is a perfect tool, but brutally realistic.</t5512> <t5513>It conveyed to me, in its own voice, the sorrow of your heart.</t5513> <t5514>No one should ever hear these words spoken again!</t5514> <t5515>Look, I tried to be helpful.</t5515> <t5516>I typed what was said on my typewriter, so that no one else will have to hear your heartbeat like I did,”</t5516>
<t5517>"Those who don't need to know, won't know," I said in a hushed voice.</t5517> <t5518>He placed his hand on mine and said very seriously:</t5518>
<t5519>“Ah, but they must hear!</t5519><t5520>”</t5520>
<t5521>"Are they obliged to!"</t5521> <t5522>"But why?" I asked.</t5522>
<t5523>“Because this is part of a terrible story and the death of poor dear Lucy and the events that caused it; in the battle ahead to rid the world of this dreadful monster, we must gather all the information and help we can get.</t5523> <t5524>In the cylinders you gave me, I believe there is more than what you want me to learn; but I can see that there is much in your records that will shed light on this dark mystery.</t5524> <t5525>You will let me help, won't you?</t5525> <t5526>I know everything up to a certain point; although your diary only takes me up to September 7th, I already understand how poor Lucy was surrounded on all sides and how her terrible inevitable end approached.</t5526> <t5527>Jonathan and I have been working day and night since Professor Van Helsing came to see us.</t5527> <t5528>Jonathan went to Whitby to get more information, and he will come here tomorrow to help us.</t5528> <t5529>There is no need for secrets among us; if we work together and with mutual absolute trust, we will undoubtedly be stronger than if some of us are left in the dark.”</t5529> <t5530>She looked at me with such pleading eyes and at the same time there was such courage and determination in her stance that I immediately agreed to her requests.</t5530> <t5531>“In this matter,” I said, “you will act as you wish.</t5531> <t5532>If I am making a mistake, may God forgive me!</t5532> <t5533>There are more terrible things to learn, but if you have come up to Lucy's death, I know you will not be content to be left in the dark.</t5533> <t5534>Moreover, the end of the matter - the very end - may bring you peace.</t5534> <t5535>Come, dinner is ready.</t5535> <t5536>We must keep each other strong for what awaits us; we have a ruthless and hair-raising task ahead.</t5536> <t5537>Once you have eaten, you will learn the rest and I will answer all the questions you have - even if everything is clear to those of us who were there, if there is something you do not understand.”</t5537>
<t5538>Mina Harker's journal</t5538>
<t5539>29 September.</t5539> <t5540>- After dinner, I went to the study with Dr. Seward.</t5540> <t5541>He brought the phonograph back from my room, and I took my typewriter.</t5541> <t5542>He seated me in a comfortable chair, adjusted the phonograph so I wouldn't have to stand up to touch it, and showed me how to stop it if I wanted to take a break.</t5542> <t5543>Then, with great thoughtfulness, he pulled a chair to sit with his back to me so I could be as free as possible, and started reading.</t5543> <t5544>I placed the fork-shaped metal piece in my ears and listened.</t5544>
<t5545>When the terrible story of Lucy's death and - and everything that happened afterward came to an end, I weakly leaned back against the back of my chair.</t5545> <t5546>When Dr. Seward saw me, he jumped up with a cry of fear and hurriedly took a small bottle from the cabinet, giving me a bit of brandy that revived me within a few minutes.</t5546> <t5547>My mind was spinning, and I think I couldn't have endured it without breaking down if it weren't for the holy light that came from the thought that my dear, dear Lucy had finally found peace amid all this horror-filled story.</t5547> <t5548>Everything is so wild, mysterious, and strange that I couldn't have believed it if I didn't know about Jonathan's experiences in Transylvania.</t5548> <t5549>Even in this situation, I didn't know what to believe, and thus I dealt with something other than the difficulty I was in.</t5549> <t5550>I lifted the cover of my typewriter and said to Dr. Seward:</t5550>
<t5551>"With your permission, I will write all this down.</t5551> <t5552>We must be ready for Dr. Van Helsing when he arrives.</t5552> <t5553>I sent a telegram to Jonathan, telling him to come here as soon as he arrives in London from Whitby.</t5553> <t5554>In this matter, dates mean everything, and if we prepare all our materials and arrange all the items in chronological order, we will have done a lot of work.</t5554> <t5555>You said that Lord Godalming and Mr. Morris would also be coming.</t5555> <t5556>When they arrive, we should be in a position to explain all this to them."</t5556> <t5557>For this, I set the phonograph to slow speed and began typing from the beginning of the seventh cylinder.</t5557> <t5558>I was using carbon paper, and thus made three copies of the journal, just like all the other documents.</t5558> <t5559>When I finished the work, it was late, but Dr. Seward had gone to visit his patients; when he finished his work, he came back and sat close to me reading, so I wouldn't feel too lonely while working.</t5559> <t5560>What a good and thoughtful person he is; the world seems full of good men - despite the monsters.</t5560> <t5561>Before leaving his side, I remembered what Jonathan wrote in his journal about the Professor being disturbed by something he read in the evening newspaper at the Exeter station; therefore, when I saw that Dr. Seward kept his newspapers, I borrowed the files of the Westminster and Pall Mall Gazettes and took them to my room.</t5561> <t5562>I remembered how much the clippings I cut from the Dailygraph and Whitby Gazettes helped us understand the terrible events that occurred in Whitby when Count Dracula came ashore; so, I will look through all the evening newspapers that have been published since then, hoping to find a new clue.</t5562> <t5563>I am not sleepy, and working will soothe me.</t5563>
<t5564>Dr. Seward's journal</t5564>
<t5565>September 30 - Mr. Harker arrived at nine o'clock.</t5565> <t5566>He received his wife's telegram just before setting off.</t5566> <t5567>If it's possible to judge by looking at his face, he is an exceptionally intelligent and energetic person.</t5567> <t5568>If what is written in his journal is true - and judging by my astonishing personal experiences, it must be - he is also someone with very strong nerves.</t5568> <t5569>Descending into the tomb chamber for the second time is a considerable act of courage.</t5569> <t5570>After reading what he wrote about the events, I was prepared to meet a good example of manliness, but I was not quite ready to meet the calm, businessman-like gentleman who arrived here today.</t5570>
<t5571>Later.</t5571> <t5572>- After lunch, Harker and his wife returned to their room, and just now, as I was passing by the room, I heard the clattering of the typewriter.</t5572> <t5573>They are working very hard on this.</t5573> <t5574>Ms. Harker says they are connecting all the pieces of evidence they have in chronological order.</t5574> <t5575>Harker has the letters between the recipient in Whitby and the transporters in London responsible for the crates.</t5575> <t5576>Now he is reading my journal, which his wife has typed up.</t5576> <t5577>I wonder what they will make of it.</t5577> <t5578>Here he comes.</t5578>
<t5579>It's strange that it never occurred to me that the house next door could be the Count's hiding place!</t5579> <t5580>God knows, our patient Renfield's behavior had provided us with enough evidence!</t5580> <t5581>The stack of letters regarding the purchase of the house was typed on a typewriter.</t5581> <t5582>Oh, if only we had these earlier, we could have saved poor Lucy!</t5582> <t5583>Wait; madness lies in this direction!</t5583> <t5584>Harker has returned and is organizing his notes again.</t5584> <t5585>He says that by mealtime, they might be able to present a coherent narrative.</t5585> <t5586>In the meantime, he thinks I should see Renfield, who has so far served as a sort of index to the Count's comings and goings.</t5586> <t5587>I don't quite understand this yet, but I believe I will when I see the dates.</t5587> <t5588>It's so good that Ms. Harker has typed the phonograph cylinders!</t5588> <t5589>We would never have found the dates otherwise.</t5589>
<t5590>I found Renfield in his room, sitting quietly with his hands clasped, laughing harmlessly.</t5590> <t5591>At that moment, he looked as sane as anyone I had ever seen.</t5591> <t5592>I sat down and talked with him about many subjects, all of which he approached naturally.</t5592> <t5593>Then he spontaneously began to talk about returning home—a topic he had never mentioned during his stay here, as far as I knew.</t5593> <t5594>In fact, he spoke quite confidently about being released immediately.</t5594> <t5595>If I had not spoken with Harker and read the letters detailing the dates of his sudden outbursts, I would have been ready to sign off after a short observation.</t5595> <t5596>In this situation, I am quite suspicious.</t5596> <t5597>All those outbursts are somehow connected to the Count's proximity to here.</t5597> <t5598>Then, what does this absolute calmness mean?</t5598> <t5599>Could it mean that his instinct is pleased with the vampire's certain victory?</t5599> <t5600>Wait; he is a zoophagous, and in his wild ramblings at the chapel door of the abandoned house, he always spoke of "my Master."</t5600> <t5601>All this seems to confirm our thoughts.</t5601> <t5602>Still, after a while, I left him; my friend is currently too sane for me to examine deeply with questions.</t5602> <t5603>He might start thinking, and then!..</t5603> <t5604>Thus, I walked away from him.</t5604> <t5605>I do not trust his calm demeanor; therefore, I told the nurse to watch him carefully and to have a straitjacket ready if necessary.</t5605>
<t5606>Jonathan Harker's journal</t5606>
<t5607>29 September, on the train to London.</t5607><t5608>- When I received Mr. Billington's kind letter, in which he said he would give me all the information he could, I thought it best to go to Whitby and conduct my desired research on site.</t5608><t5609>My aim now was to trace the Count's dreadful cargo to its location in London.</t5609><t5610>Then, we could deal with him.</t5610><t5611>His pleasant son, Billington, met me at the station and brought me to his father's house, where they had decided I should stay the night.</t5611><t5612>They showed true Yorkshire hospitality: giving the guest everything and leaving him free to do as he pleased.</t5612><t5613>They all knew I was busy and that my visit would be short, and Mr. Billington had prepared all the documents related to the transport of the crates in his study.</t5613><t5614>Seeing one of the letters I had previously seen on the Count's desk before learning of his diabolical plans almost caused me to have a fit.</t5614><t5615>Everything was done carefully, systematically, and with sensitivity.</t5615><t5616>He seemed prepared for any accidental obstacle that might arise on the path to achieving his goals.</t5616><t5617>In modern terms, he "left nothing to chance," and the absolute precision with which his instructions were carried out was merely the logical result of his meticulousness.</t5617><t5618>I saw and noted the invoice: "Fifty crates of ordinary soil for experimental purposes." Additionally, there was a copy of a letter to Carter Paterson and their responses; I took copies of both.</t5618><t5619>This was all the information Mr. Billington could give me, so I went down to the port and saw the coast guards, customs officers, and the harbor master.</t5619><t5620>They all had something to say about the ship's strange arrival, which was already becoming part of local lore, but no one had anything to add to the simple description of "fifty crates filled with ordinary soil."</t5620><t5621>Then, with great courtesy, I met the station master who arranged for me to speak with the men who actually received the crates.</t5621><t5622>Their cargo list was identical to mine, and they had nothing to add except that the crates were "substantial and deadly heavy," and that loading them was a tedious job.</t5622><t5623>One of them added that it was a great misfortune that no one else "like me, a gentleman," had thanked them for their efforts in liquid form; another added that the thirst that arose at that time had not entirely subsided even with the passage of time.</t5623><t5624>Needless to say, before leaving them, I did not neglect to forever and adequately address the source of their grievances.</t5624>
<t5625>September 30.</t5625> <t5626>- The station master was kind enough to give me a note to take to his old friend, the station master at King’s Cross, so that when I arrived there the next morning, I could ask him questions about the arrival of the crates.</t5626> <t5627>He immediately introduced me to the clerks who were handling the matter, and I saw that the cargo lists matched the original invoice.</t5627> <t5628>Here, the opportunities for extraordinary thirst were limited; but they had been taken advantage of in a more noble manner, and once again I had to deal with the result in an expostfacto manner.</t5628>
<t5629>From there, I went to the central office of Carter Paterson, where I was received with great courtesy.</t5629> <t5630>They searched the daybooks and letter registers for the transaction and immediately called their King’s Cross office for more details.</t5630> <t5631>By chance, the men who made up the team were waiting for work at that time, and the clerk promptly sent all the documents related to the delivery of the bill of lading and the crates to Carfax with them.</t5631> <t5632>Here, I also saw that the cargo lists matched exactly; the men from the transport company were able to cover the inadequacy of the written words by adding a few words.</t5632> <t5633>Soon I realized that these were only related to the dusty nature of the work and the thirst it created in the men.</t5633> <t5634>Upon seizing the opportunity to remedy this useful evil at a later date with the currency of the Kingdom, one of the men said:</t5634>
<t5635>“That house, boss, was one of the strangest houses I had ever entered.</t5635> <t5636>Believe me! But it hadn't been touched for about a hundred years.</t5636> <t5637>It was covered with a layer of dust thick enough to sleep on without hurting your bones, and it was so neglected that you could smell the old Jerusalem.</t5637> <t5638>But the old chapel - it was a disaster!</t5638> <t5639>My partner and I thought we could never get out quickly enough.</t5639> <t5640>My God! I wouldn't have stayed there after dark for less than a pound.</t5640><t5641>”</t5641>
<t5642>Since I had been in that house before, I could very well believe him, but if he knew what I knew, I think he would raise his conditions.</t5642>
<t5643>Now I am satisfied with one thing: All the crates that came from Varna to Whitby with the Demeter have safely arrived at the old chapel of Carfax.</t5643> <t5644>If they haven't been taken from there since then, there should be fifty of them - according to Dr. Seward's journal, I have concerns about this.</t5644>
<t5645>Later.</t5645> <t5646>- Mina and I worked all day and organized all the documents.</t5646>

<t5648>September 30 - I am so happy that I almost don't know how to control myself.</t5648> <t5649>I think I am reacting this way to the fear that won't leave me: the fear that this terrible event and the reopening of the old wound could harm Jonathan.</t5649> <t5650>I watched his departure to Whitby with as much courage as I could muster, but I felt as if I were sick with worry.</t5650> <t5651>But this effort did him good.</t5651> <t5652>He has never been as determined, as strong, or possessed such fierce energy as he does now.</t5652> <t5653>Just as dear kind-hearted Professor Van Helsing said: It was a true example of courage, and he is getting better while experiencing a tension that could kill someone of weaker constitution.</t5653> <t5654>When he returned, he was full of life, hope, and determination; we have arranged everything for tonight.</t5654> <t5655>I feel like I am going mad with excitement.</t5655> <t5656>One must pity something that hunts like the Count.</t5656> <t5657>Here it is: This Thing is not human - not even an animal.</t5657> <t5658>Reading Dr. Seward's writings about Lucy's death and what happened afterwards is enough to dry up the source of compassion in one's heart.</t5658>
<t5659>Later on.</t5659> <t5660>- Lord Godalming and Mr. Morris arrived earlier than we expected.</t5660> <t5661>Dr. Seward was out for work and had taken Jonathan with him, so I had to receive them.</t5661> <t5662>It was a painful encounter for me because it reminded me of dear poor Lucy's hopes just a few months ago.</t5662> <t5663>Of course, they had heard Lucy speak of me, and as Mr. Morris mentioned, Dr. Van Helsing had "praised me to the skies."</t5663> <t5664>The poor fellows were unaware that I knew both of them had proposed to Lucy.</t5664> <t5665>Since they didn't know how much I was aware of the matter, they were unsure of what to say or do; therefore, they had to continue talking about ordinary topics.</t5665> <t5666>Still, I thought about the matter and concluded that the best thing I could do was to inform them about what had happened so far.</t5666> <t5667>From Dr. Seward's journal, I knew that they were present at Lucy's death - her real death - and that I didn't need to fear revealing a secret prematurely.</t5667> <t5668>Thus, I told them that I had read all the documents and journals as best as I could and that my husband and I had just finished arranging all the documents after typing them up.</t5668> <t5669>I gave each of them a copy to read in the library.</t5669> <t5670>When Lord Godalming took his copy and turned it over in his hands - it formed quite a thick bundle - he said:</t5670>
<t5671>"Did you write all of this, Ms. Harker?</t5671><t5672>"</t5672>
<t5673>When I nodded in agreement, he continued his words:</t5673>
<t5674>“I don't quite understand the purpose of this; but you are such good and refined people, and you work with such seriousness and effort that the only thing I can do is to blindly accept your thoughts and try to help you.</t5674> <t5675>I have already received a lesson on the truths that will ensure a person remains humble until the last moment of their life.</t5675> <t5676>Also, I know that you love my poor Lucy...”</t5676> <t5677>Here, he turned his head away and covered his face with his hands.</t5677> <t5678>I could hear the tears in his voice.</t5678> <t5679>Mr. Morris instinctively placed his hand on his shoulder for a moment and quietly left the room.</t5679> <t5680>I think there is something in the nature of women that makes men feel the freedom to express their feelings about their sensitive, emotional sides and cry without feeling that their masculinity is diminished, because as soon as Lord Godalming found himself alone with me, he sat on the couch and completely, openly let himself go.</t5680> <t5681>I sat next to him and held his hand.</t5681> <t5682>I hope he didn't think I overstepped, and if he ever thinks about this moment in the future, such a thought doesn't cross his mind.</t5682> <t5683>Here, I am being unfair to him: I know he won't - he is a true gentleman.</t5683> <t5684>Seeing that his heart was broken, I said to him:</t5684>
<t5685>“I loved dear Lucy and I know what she meant to you, and what you meant to her.</t5685> <t5686>She and I were like siblings, and now that she is gone, won't you let me be like a sibling to you in this troubled time?</t5686> <t5687>Although I cannot measure its depth, I know the pains you are going through.</t5687> <t5688>If sympathy and compassion can help you in your sorrow, won't you let me be of some use - for Lucy's sake?</t5688><t5689>”</t5689>
<t5690>For a moment, the poor man was overwhelmed with sorrow.</t5690> <t5691>All the silent suffering he had endured recently seemed to suddenly find an outlet, it seemed to me.</t5691> <t5692>He lost himself quite a bit and, raising his hands, clapped his palms together in great pain.</t5692> <t5693>He stood up and then sat down again, tears streaming down his cheeks like rain.</t5693> <t5694>I felt infinite compassion for him and, without thinking, opened my arms.</t5694> <t5695>Sobbing, he rested his head on my shoulder and cried like a child exhausted from being shaken by emotion.</t5695>
<t5696>In us women, there is a maternal aspect that allows us to overcome small events that evoke the spirit of motherhood; I felt the head of this big, sorrowful man on me as if it were the head of a baby that might lie on my chest in the future, and I stroked his hair as if he were my own child.</t5696> <t5697>At that time, I never thought about how strange all this was.</t5697>
<t5698>Shortly after, his hiccups ceased, and without hiding his emotion, he apologized and stood up.</t5698> <t5699>He said that during the past days and nights - tiresome days and sleepless nights - he couldn't talk to anyone as one should when suffering.</t5699> <t5700>There was no woman who could give him empathy, nor was there anyone he could openly talk to because of the terrible circumstances surrounding his grief.</t5700> <t5701>"Now, I know how much I have suffered," he said, wiping his eyes, "but even now, I can't know what your sweet goodwill means to me today - and no one else in my place could know either.</t5701> <t5702>I will understand this better over time, and believe me, even though I am not being ungrateful right now, my gratitude will grow as I begin to understand the situation more.</t5702> <t5703>Throughout our lives, you will allow me to be your brother, won't you - for the sake of dear Lucy?</t5703><t5704>"</t5704>
<t5705>“For dear Lucy's sake,” I said as we shook hands.</t5705> <t5706>“Agreed - and for your sake,” he added, “because if a man's respect and gratitude are things worth earning, you have earned mine today.</t5706> <t5707>If in the future, there are times when you need a man's help, believe me, your call will not go unanswered.</t5707> <t5708>May God never show you such times that would darken the daylight of your life, but if such a day comes, promise me you will let me know.”</t5708> <t5709>He was so sincere and his grief so fresh that I felt this would comfort him, and so I said:</t5709>
<t5710>“I promise.</t5710><t5711>”</t5711>
<t5712>As I was walking through the corridor, I saw Mr. Morris looking out the window.</t5712> <t5713>He turned when he heard my footsteps.</t5713> <t5714>“How is Art?” he said.</t5714> <t5715>Then, noticing my red eyes, he continued: “Ah, I see you were comforting him.</t5715> <t5716>Poor old friend!</t5716> <t5717>He needs it.</t5717> <t5718>When a man's heart is troubled, only women can help, and he had no one to comfort him.</t5718><t5719>”</t5719>
<t5720>He carried his burden so bravely that my heart bled for him.</t5720> <t5721>I saw the papers in his hand and knew that when he read them, he would learn how much I knew; therefore, I said to him:</t5721>
<t5722>“I wish I could comfort everyone who is wounded in their heart.</t5722> <t5723>Will you allow me to be your friend and will you come to me if you need comfort?</t5723> <t5724>Later, you will understand why I spoke this way.”</t5724> <t5725>Seeing my sincerity, he bowed, took my hand, brought it to his lips, and kissed it.</t5725> <t5726>For such a brave and selfless soul, this was a very small comfort, and without thinking, I bent down and kissed him.</t5726> <t5727>His eyes filled with tears and his throat choked for a moment, he said with great calm:</t5727>
<t5728>"Little girl, you will not regret this heartfelt kindness for as long as you live!" Then, she went to her study, to her friend's side.</t5728>
<t5729>"Little girl!" - The same words he used for Lucy, but it proved his friendship!</t5729>
<t5730>XVIII</t5730>
<t5731>Dr. Seward's journal</t5731>
<t5732>September 30.</t5732> <t5733>- I returned home at five o'clock and saw that not only had Godalming and Morris arrived, but they had also already examined the various journal and letter texts prepared and organized by Harker and his excellent wife.</t5733> <t5734>Harker had not yet returned from the transporter's men, as Dr. Hennessey had informed me by letter.</t5734> <t5735>Ms. Harker gave us each a cup of tea, and I can honestly say that for the first time since I started living here, this old house felt like a home.</t5735> <t5736>When we finished our tea, Ms. Harker said:</t5736>
<t5737>"Dr. Seward, may I ask you for something?</t5737> <t5738>I want to see your patient, Mr. Renfield.</t5738> <t5739>I want to see him.</t5739> <t5740>The things you mentioned about him in your journal intrigued me a lot!" She looked so charming, so beautiful that I couldn't refuse her, and there was no reason to refuse, so I took her to the man.</t5740> <t5741>When I entered the room, I told the man that a lady wanted to see him, to which he simply replied, "Why?"</t5741>
<t5742>“She is wandering around and wants to see everyone inside,” I replied.</t5742> <t5743>“Oh, very well,” she said, “of course, let her in; but wait a minute until I tidy up here.”</t5743> <t5744>The tidying method was unusual: Before I could stop her, she swallowed all the flies and spiders in the boxes.</t5744>
<t5745>It was very clear that he was afraid of interference in his work or felt jealousy.</t5745> <t5746>When he completed his disgusting task, he cheerfully said, "Let the lady come in," and sat on the edge of his bed, raising his eyes so he could see the lady's entrance.</t5746> <t5747>For a moment, I thought he might have the intention to kill; I remembered how calm he was just before attacking me in my study, and I made sure to stand in a place where I could catch him if he tried to jump on Ms. Harker.</t5747> <t5748>Ms. Harker entered the room with a natural grace that would suddenly earn the respect of any madman.</t5748> <t5749>She walked towards Renfield with a pleasant smile and extended her hand.</t5749>
<t5750>“Good evening, Mr. Renfield,” she said.</t5750> <t5751>“You see, I know you because Dr. Seward has told me about you.”</t5751> <t5752>Renfield did not respond immediately, but with a sullen expression, he examined her carefully from head to toe.</t5752> <t5753>This gaze turned into a curiosity mixed with suspicion; then, to my great surprise, he said:</t5753>
<t5754>“You are not the young girl the Doctor wants to marry, are you?</t5754> <t5755>You can't be, you know, because she died.” Ms. Harker replied with a sweet smile: “Oh, no! I have my own husband whom I married before seeing Dr. Seward or he seeing me.</t5755> <t5756>I am Ms. Harker.</t5756><t5757>”</t5757>
<t5758>“So what are you doing here then?</t5758><t5759>”</t5759>
<t5760>“My husband and I came to visit Dr. Seward.</t5760><t5761>”</t5761>
<t5762>"Then don't stay here.</t5762><t5763>"</t5763>
<t5764>“But why?” I thought that this kind of conversation might not be very pleasant for Ms. Harker, just as it wasn't for me, so I joined in:</t5764>
<t5765>"How did you know that I wanted to marry someone?"</t5765> <t5766>In the brief moment when he shifted his gaze from Ms. Harker to me and then immediately back to her, his response was very dismissive:</t5766>
<t5767>"What a foolish question!"</t5767><t5768>"</t5768>
<t5769>“I don't understand anything, Mr. Renfield,” said Ms. Harker, immediately defending me.</t5769> <t5770>He responded to her with the same degree of delicacy and respect as his disdain for me:</t5770>
<t5771>“When a man is loved and honored as our host is, you will of course understand, Ms. Harker, that everything about him greatly interests our small community. Dr. Seward is loved not only by the household and friends but even by some of his patients, whose mental balance is barely maintained and who have a tendency to distort cause-and-effect relationships.</t5771> <t5772>Since I live in the mental hospital, I cannot help but notice the wise tendencies of some of its residents to make errors such as non causae46 and ignoratio elenchi47.</t5772> <t5773>I have certainly opened my eyes to this new development.</t5773> <t5774>Here is my pet lunatic -the most prominent example of his kind I have encountered to date- discussing fundamental philosophy and doing so with the demeanor of a polite gentleman.</t5774> <t5775>Was it perhaps Ms. Harker's presence that touched a point in his mind?</t5775> <t5776>If this new phase is occurring spontaneously or somehow due to Ms. Harker's unconscious influence, it means she has a rare talent or power.</t5776>
<t5777>We continued talking for a while longer, and seeing that Renfield appeared quite rational, Ms. Harker, with questioning eyes, dared to steer him towards his favorite topic.</t5777> <t5778>Again, I was astonished because he dedicated himself to answering the question with the impartiality of someone entirely sane, even using himself as an example when discussing certain things.</t5778>
<t5779>“Look, personally, I am also one of those people with strange beliefs.</t5779> <t5780>It is not surprising that my friends are afraid and insist on having me under control.</t5780> <t5781>I believed that life is a positive and continuous existence and that by consuming a large number of living beings, no matter how low they are in the order of creation, a person could indefinitely extend their life.</t5781> <t5782>From time to time, this belief was so strong that I even attempted to take human life.</t5782> <t5783>The Doctor here will confirm that once, I tried to kill him to increase my vital forces by assimilating his life through his blood - Of course, based on the phrase from the Holy Bible, ‘For the life of the flesh is in the blood.’</t5783> <t5784>But in reality, the person selling certain old wives' remedies vulgarizes the matter to the point of insulting reality.</t5784> <t5785>Isn't that right, Doctor?”</t5785> <t5786>I nodded because I was so surprised that I didn't know what to think or say; it was hard to believe that just five minutes ago, I had seen him eating his spiders and flies.</t5786> <t5787>When I looked at my watch, I saw that I needed to go to the station to meet Van Helsing, and so I told Ms. Harker that it was time to leave.</t5787> <t5788>Ms. Harker kindly said to Mr. Renfield, “Goodbye, I hope to see you more often under more pleasant circumstances,” and then immediately left.</t5788> <t5789>Mr. Renfield responded to this, surprising me:</t5789>
<t5790>“Goodbye, my dear.</t5790> <t5791>I pray to God that I may never see your sweet face again.</t5791> <t5792>May God bless and protect you!</t5792><t5793>”</t5793>
<t5794>When I went to the station to meet Van Helsing, I left the children behind.</t5794> <t5795>Poor Art looks happier than he has been since Lucy first fell ill, and Quincey seems to have returned to his bright self for the first time in many long days.</t5795>
<t5796>Van Helsing got off the carriage with the impatience and agility of a child.</t5796> <t5797>He immediately saw me and, walking quickly towards me, said:</t5797>
<t5798>“Ah, my friend John, how is everything going?</t5798> <t5799>Is it good?</t5799> <t5800>Alright! I was busy because I came here to stay if necessary.</t5800> <t5801>Everything is arranged with me and I have a lot to tell.</t5801> <t5802>Is Madam Mina with you? Yes.</t5802> <t5803>And what about her very nice husband?</t5803> <t5804>And Arthur and my friend Quincey, they are with you too, aren't they?</t5804> <t5805>Great!</t5805><t5806>”</t5806>
<t5807>As I was driving the car home, I told him what had happened and how my journal had been useful based on Ms. Harker's suggestion; upon which the Professor interrupted me:</t5807>
<t5808>“Ah, the wonderful Madam Mina! She has a man's brain - a brain that, if a man is lucky, he might possess - and a woman's heart.</t5808> <t5809>When the kind-hearted God made such a good mixture, believe me, He created her for a specific purpose.</t5809> <t5810>My friend John, so far, luck has allowed that woman to help us; after tonight, she should have no further involvement with this dreadful affair.</t5810> <t5811>It is not good for her to take such a great risk.</t5811> <t5812>We men are determined to destroy this monster - moreover, we have promised, haven't we?</t5812> <t5813>But this is not a woman's duty.</t5813> <t5814>Even if she is not harmed, her heart might fail her amidst all this horror, and she might suffer afterwards - because of her nerves while awake and because of her dreams while asleep.</t5814> <t5815>And besides, she is a young woman and has not been married long; there might be other things to consider, if not now, then later.</t5815> <t5816>You told me she has written everything down, so she should exchange views with us, but tomorrow she will bid farewell to this matter, and we will continue alone.”</t5816> <t5817>I wholeheartedly agreed with him and then told him what we had found in his absence: the house Dracula had bought was the one right next to mine.</t5817> <t5818>He was very surprised by this and seemed to be filled with great doubt.</t5818> <t5819>“Ah, if only we had known this sooner!” he said, “Because then we could have reached poor Lucy in time to save her.</t5819> <t5820>But as you said, ‘There is no use crying over spilled milk.’</t5820> <t5821>We should not dwell on this and must proceed on our path to the end.”</t5821> <t5822>Then, he fell into silence until we reached the garden gate.</t5822> <t5823>Before going to prepare for dinner, he said to Ms. Harker:</t5823>
<t5824>"Madam Mina, my friend John told me that you and your husband have put everything in the correct order so far.</t5824><t5825>"</t5825>
<t5826>“Not what has happened so far, Professor,” he said without hesitation, “but what has happened up until this morning.</t5826><t5827>”</t5827>
<t5828>“But why not what has happened so far?</t5828> <t5829>So far, we have seen how all the little things shed light on events.</t5829> <t5830>We have revealed our secrets and no one is worse off because of it yet.</t5830><t5831>”</t5831>
<t5832>Ms. Harker's face began to blush and she took out a piece of paper from her pocket, saying:</t5832>
<t5833>“Dr. Van Helsing, could you read this and tell me whether it should be included in the report?”</t5833> <t5834>“The record I kept for today.</t5834> <t5835>Even if it is insignificant, I have seen the necessity of writing everything down immediately, but there is very little here apart from personal matters.</t5835> <t5836>Should this be included as well?” The professor read the paper seriously and said while handing it back: “If you do not wish, it may not be included, but I request that you do include it.</t5836> <t5837>It might cause your husband to love you more and all of us, your friends, to value and respect you more, besides loving you more.” Ms. Harker, blushing and with a radiant smile, took the paper back.</t5837>
<t5838>And thus, by this hour, all the records were completed and sorted.</t5838> <t5839>After dinner, the professor took a copy to work on before our meeting, which we had decided to hold at nine o'clock.</t5839> <t5840>The rest of us had already read everything; thus, when we gathered in the study, we would be informed about the facts and could make our battle plan against this terrible and mysterious enemy.</t5840>
<t5841>Mina Harker's diary</t5841>
<t5842>September 30 - When we met in Dr. Seward's study two hours after the six o'clock dinner, we had unconsciously formed a sort of committee or council.</t5842> <t5843>When Professor Van Helsing entered the room, he took the seat at the head of the table, as indicated by Dr. Seward.</t5843> <t5844>He seated me to his right and asked me to take on the role of secretary; Jonathan sat next to me.</t5844> <t5845>Opposite us were Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, and Mr. Morris - Lord Godalming sat next to the Professor and Dr. Seward took the middle seat.</t5845> <t5846>The Professor said:</t5846>
<t5847>“I believe I can assume that we are all aware of the facts in these documents.”</t5847> <t5848>We all agreed to this, and he continued:</t5848>
<t5849>"In that case, it would be good if I told you some things about the kind of enemy we have to deal with.</t5849> <t5850>Then, as far as I have researched, I will tell you the history of this man.</t5850> <t5851>Thus, we can discuss how we will proceed and take our precautions.</t5851>
<t5852>There are beings called vampires; some of us have evidence that they truly exist.</t5852> <t5853>Even if we don't have proof from our own unhappy experience, the teachings and records of the past provide enough evidence for sane people.</t5853> <t5854>I admit that I approached this with skepticism at first.</t5854> <t5855>If I hadn't trained myself to be open-minded over the years, I wouldn't have believed it until the truth roared in my ear at such a time, 'Look! Look! I am proving it!</t5855> <t5856>I am proving it!'</t5856> <t5857>Alas! If I had known at the beginning what I know now - even if I had made an assumption - such a precious life would have been spared for those of us who love it.</t5857> <t5858>But that is in the past; we must work so that other souls we can protect do not perish.</t5858> <t5859>Nosferatu, like a bee, does not die because it stings once.</t5859> <t5860>It only grows stronger and, because it grows stronger, it has more power to do evil.</t5860> <t5861>This vampire among us has the strength of twenty men, is more cunning than mortals because its cunning has developed over centuries; still, with the help of necromancy and as the root of the word indicates, it means seeing the future through the dead and that the dead it can approach come under its command, it is a ruthless and more than ruthless, a heartless demon, and it has no emotion in its heart, within certain limits, it can appear at any time, in any place, and in any form it desires, within a certain distance, it can control the air: it can create storms, mist, lightning, it can command lesser creatures - rats, owls, and bats - moths, foxes, and wolves; it can grow and shrink and at times disappear and become unknown.</t5861> <t5862>Then, how shall we begin our struggle to destroy it?</t5862> <t5863>How shall we find its place and, when we find it, how can we destroy it?</t5863> <t5864>My friends, this is too much; the task we have undertaken may have a dreadful outcome that would make the bravest tremble.</t5864> <t5865>For if we fail in this struggle, surely it will have won; then what will become of us?</t5865> <t5866>Life is not important; I do not care about it.</t5866> <t5867>But failing here is not just a matter of life and death.</t5867> <t5868>We would become like it; henceforth, we would be among the vile creatures of the night - heartless, merciless, feeding on the bodies and souls of those we love the most...</t5868> <t5869>The gates of Heaven would be closed to us forever, for who would ever open them for us again?</t5869> <t5870>Everyone would despise us forever, a black stain in the daylight of God, an arrow in the side of Him who died for humanity.</t5870> <t5871>But we are faced with duty, and should we shrink from such a cause?</t5871> <t5872>As for me, I say no, but I am old and life with its daylight, its beautiful places, its birdsong, its music, and its love is far behind me.</t5872> <t5873>You others are young.</t5873> <t5874>Some have seen sorrow, but there are still beautiful days ahead of you.</t5874> <t5875>What do you say?</t5875><t5876>"</t5876>
<t5877>While the professor was speaking, Jonathan had held my hand.</t5877> <t5878>When I saw his hand reaching out, I was very afraid that the terrifying nature of the danger we were facing would weaken him once again, but feeling his touch meant life to me - so strong, so confident, and so determined.</t5878> <t5879>The hand of the brave man can speak for him, and there is no need for a woman's love to hear his music.</t5879>
<t5880>When the professor finished his speech, my husband looked into my eyes, and I looked into his eyes; we didn't need to speak with words.</t5880>
<t5881>“I take responsibility for Mina and myself,” he said.</t5881> <t5882>“Count me in, Professor,” said Mr. Quincey Morris, as concise as ever.</t5882>
<t5883>“I am with you too,” said Lord Godalming, “if for no other reason than for Lucy’s sake.</t5883><t5884>”</t5884>
<t5885>Dr. Seward only nodded with his head.</t5885> <t5886>The professor stood up, placed his golden cross on the table, and then extended his hands to his sides.</t5886> <t5887>I took his right hand, Lord Godalming his left hand, Jonathan took my right hand with his left and reached out to Mr. Morris.</t5887> <t5888>Thus, with all of us holding hands, our sacred agreement was made.</t5888> <t5889>I felt my heart freeze, but the thought of retreating never crossed my mind.</t5889> <t5890>We returned to our former places and Dr.</t5890>
<t5891>Van Helsing continued his words with a kind of cheerfulness that indicated serious work had begun.</t5891> <t5892>As with any other matter in life, the issue had to be approached with seriousness and common sense.</t5892>
<t5893>“Alright, you know what we are fighting against, but we are not powerless either.</t5893> <t5894>We have the power of unity on our side - a power spared from the vampire kind, we have the resources of science, the freedom to act and think, and the hours of day and night are equally ours.</t5894> <t5895>In fact, as our powers grow, they become more unrestrained and we are free to use them.</t5895> <t5896>We have a dedication to a purpose and an unselfish end to achieve.</t5896> <t5897>These are important things.</t5897>
<t5898>Now, let's see how the general forces arrayed against us are limited, while the individual ones are not able to do so.</t5898> <t5899>In short, let's think about the limits of vampires in general and this one in particular.</t5899>
<t5900>The only thing we can rely on is traditions and superstitions.</t5900> <t5901>When it comes to matters of life and death - even more than life and death - these may not seem very apparent at first glance.</t5901> <t5902>Nevertheless, we should be glad about it, because firstly, we are compelled to - we have nothing else under our control - and secondly, because ultimately these - tradition and superstition - mean everything.</t5902> <t5903>For others - but not for us - isn't the belief in vampires based on these?</t5903> <t5904>A year ago, in the midst of the scientific, realistic nineteenth century, which of us would have accepted such a possibility?</t5904> <t5905>We even rejected the belief confirmed right before our eyes.</t5905> <t5906>Then, assume for a moment that the belief in the vampire, its boundaries, and its cure are also based on this foundation.</t5906> <t5907>Because, let me tell you, it is recognized wherever mankind exists.</t5907> <t5908>It shines in ancient Greece, ancient Rome, all of Germany, in France, India, even in the Thracian Peninsula, in China, in places far from us under any circumstances, and even today people fear it.</t5908>
<t5909>The Icelandic wild warrior, the son of the devil Hun, the Slav, the Saxon, the Hungarian came into the world after their revival.</t5909><t5910>At that time, all we could base our actions on was this, and let me tell you that many of these beliefs have been confirmed by our own very unfortunate experiences.</t5910><t5911>The vampire continues to live and cannot die merely with the passage of time; by feeding on the blood of the living, he can become even healthier.</t5911><t5912>Moreover, we have seen that he can even rejuvenate over time; his vital abilities become more functional and seem to renew themselves when he has plenty of his special food.</t5912><t5913>But without this diet, he cannot maintain his health; he does not eat like others.</t5913><t5914>Even our friend Jonathan, who stayed with him for weeks, never saw him eat, not even once!</t5914><t5915>He had no shadow, and as Jonathan observed, he has no reflection in the mirror.</t5915><t5916>He possesses the strength of many men - Jonathan witnessed this again when he closed the door to the wolves and helped him down from the carriage.</t5916><t5917>When he tore apart the dog, as we understood from the ship docking at Whitby, he can transform into a wolf; as Madam Mina saw him at the window in Whitby, and our friend John saw him flying very close to the house, and our friend Quincey saw him at Miss Lucy's window, he can also become a bat.</t5917><t5918>He can come within the mist he creates - the captain of that noble ship proved this, but as far as we know, the distance of this mist is limited and can only be around him.</t5918><t5919>He comes like pure dust particles in the moonlight - just as Jonathan saw those sisters at Dracula's castle.</t5919><t5920>He can become very small - we saw him pass through the hair-thin gap in Miss Lucy's tomb door before finding peace.</t5920><t5921>Once he finds his way, no matter how tightly bound it is or even if it is melted and fused with fire - you call it soldering - he can get out of anywhere and enter anywhere.</t5921><t5922>He can see in the dark - this is no small power in a world half deprived of darkness.</t5922><t5923>But listen until I finish.</t5923><t5924>He can do all this but is not free.</t5924><t5925>No! More captive than a galley slave, more captive than a madman in his cell.</t5925><t5926>He cannot go wherever he wants; though he is not of nature, he still has to obey some natural laws - why, we do not know.</t5926><t5927>He cannot enter any place for the first time unless invited by one of the household, but then, he can come as he pleases.</t5927><t5928>With the dawn of day, as with all evil, his power vanishes.</t5928><t5929>He has limited freedom only at certain times.</t5929><t5930>If he is not in the place he is bound to, he can change himself only at noon or exactly at sunrise or sunset.</t5930><t5931>These are the things we have been told and what we have been able to find evidence for based on our record.</t5931><t5932>Therefore, within the unblessed place, as we saw when he went to the grave of the suicide in Whitby, he can do as he pleases within its boundaries, but at other times he can only change when the time comes.</t5932><t5933>It is also said that he can cross running water only when it is still or at rising tide.</t5933><t5934>Then, there are things that worry him because he has no power against them; as far as we know, things like garlic, holy items, and this symbol among us when we have made a firm decision, that is, the cross, for him, these are nothing, and in their presence, he withdraws respectfully and becomes silent.</t5934><t5935>There are other things I will tell you about, in case we need them in our search.</t5935><t5936>A bunch of wild rose placed on his coffin will prevent him from getting out; a blessed bullet shot into the coffin will kill him and thus make him truly dead, and as for the stake that will pass through him, we already know the peace it brings, or the peace brought by the severed head.</t5936><t5937>We have seen this with our own eyes.</t5937>
<t5938>Therefore, when we learn the resting place of what was once human, if we adhere to what we know, we can imprison it in its coffin and destroy it.</t5938> <t5939>But it is clever.</t5939> <t5940>I asked my friend Arminius from the University of Budapest about its past, and he used all his resources to tell me what it was like in the past.</t5940> <t5941>Indeed, it must be Vlad the Impaler, Dracula, who earned his name fighting against the Turks on the great river at the border of Turkish lands.</t5941> <t5942>If so, then he is no ordinary person, because it was said that during those times and in the following centuries, he was the smartest, most cunning person and also the bravest of the sons of the 'land beyond the forest.'</t5942> <t5943>This great mind and steel-like determination went to the grave with him, and even now they stand against us.</t5943> <t5944>According to Arminius, the Draculas were a great and noble race, believed by their contemporaries to have dealings with the devil from time to time.</t5944> <t5945>They learned the secrets of the Devil at Scholomance, located among the mountains over the lake in Hermannstadt, which the tenth scholar of the devil claimed as his right.</t5945> <t5946>The records contain words like stregoica, meaning witch, ordog and pokol, meaning Devil and Hell, and in one of these manuscripts, Dracula is referred to as a wampyr - which we all understand very well what it means.</t5946> <t5947>From these seeds came great men, good women, and their graves sanctify the soil where only this evil can live.</t5947> <t5948>Because the fact that this evil is found at the root of all goodness is not the least terrifying aspect, it cannot find peace in the soil where sacred memories do not reside.</t5948><t5949>"</t5949>
<t5950>While they were talking, Mr. Morris kept looking at the window without stopping and now he quietly got up and left the room.</t5950> <t5951>There was a brief silence and the Professor continued his words:</t5951>
<t5952>"And now we need to decide what to do.</t5952> <t5953>We have a lot of data and we must proceed by planning our battle.</t5953> <t5954>From Jonathan's research, we know that fifty crates of soil came from the castle to Whitby and all of them were delivered to Carfax; additionally, we know that at least a few of these crates have been moved elsewhere.</t5954> <t5955>It seems to me that our first step should be to find out whether the remaining crates are still in the house behind the wall we looked at today or if there are other crates that have been moved.</t5955> <t5956>If the second possibility has occurred, then we must track them...</t5956><t5957>”</t5957>
<t5958>Here, our conversation was frighteningly interrupted.</t5958> <t5959>A gunshot came from outside the house; the window glass shattered with a bullet that ricocheted off the top of the window frame and embedded itself in the wall at the far end of the room.</t5959> <t5960>I guess I am actually a coward, because I screamed.</t5960> <t5961>All the men jumped to their feet; Lord Godalming flew to the window and quickly raised the window glass.</t5961> <t5962>As he did this, we heard Mr. Morris's voice from outside:</t5962>
<t5963>"I'm sorry!</t5963> <t5964>I think I scared you.</t5964> <t5965>Let me come in and explain what happened."</t5965> <t5966>A minute later, he came in and said:</t5966>
<t5967>“It was foolish of me to do this, and I ask for your forgiveness.</t5967> <t5968>Ms. Harker, I sincerely apologize, I believe I frightened you terribly.</t5968> <t5969>But the truth is, while the Professor was speaking, a huge bat came and sat on the window sill.</t5969> <t5970>After the recent events, I hate these damn animals so much that I can't stand them, and in the past few days, as I have done every night when I see a bat, I went out to shoot at it.</t5970> <t5971>At that time, you were mocking me for this, Art.</t5971><t5972>”</t5972>
<t5973>"Did you shoot it?" asked Dr. Van Helsing.</t5973> <t5974>"I don't know, I think not, because it flew towards the forest."</t5974> <t5975>Without saying anything else, he sat down, and the Professor began to continue his explanations:</t5975>
<t5976>“We must track each of these crates and, when we are ready, either capture or kill this monster in its own lair; or, so to speak, cleanse the soil of germs so that it can never again seek safety in the earth.</t5976> <t5977>Thus, in the end, we can find it in human form between noon and sunset and fight it when it is at its weakest.</t5977>
<t5978>And now, Madam Mina, as for you, tonight will be your last until everything is resolved.</t5978> <t5979>You are too valuable to us to be put in such danger.</t5979> <t5980>When we part tonight, you must ask no more questions.</t5980> <t5981>We will tell you everything in due time.</t5981> <t5982>We are men and can endure; but you must be our star, our hope, and we will move more freely when you are not in danger like us.</t5982><t5983>”</t5983>
<t5984>All the men, even Jonathan, seemed relieved, but the thought of them challenging danger and perhaps reducing their safety because of me—because strength is the greatest security—did not sit well with me. However, they had made their decision, and although it was a bitter pill for me to swallow, I could say nothing other than to accept their heroic protection.</t5984>
<t5985>Mr. Morris returned to the discussion:</t5985>
<t5986>“Since there is no time to lose, I suggest we look at his house right now.</t5986> <t5987>Time is everything for him, and moving quickly might save a new victim.”</t5987> <t5988>I confess that my heart started to fail me as the time for action drew so near, but I said nothing because I feared that if I appeared as a hindrance or obstacle to their work, they might exclude me from all their discussions.</t5988> <t5989>Now, they have gone to Carfax with the intention of entering the house.</t5989>
<t5990>In a manly manner, they told me to lie down and sleep; as if a woman whose loved ones are in danger could sleep!</t5990> <t5991>When Jonathan returns, I will lie down and pretend to be asleep so that he doesn't add new worries about me to his concerns.</t5991>
<t5992>Dr. Seward's journal</t5992>
<t5993>October 1, 4 AM.</t5993> <t5994>- Just as I was about to leave the house, I received an urgent message from Renfield asking if I could see him as soon as possible because he had something extremely important to tell me.</t5994> <t5995>I told the messenger to inform him that I would attend to his request in the morning and that I was currently busy.</t5995> <t5996>The nurse added:</t5996>
<t5997>“He seems very insistent, sir.</t5997> <t5998>I have never seen him so impatient before.</t5998> <t5999>I don't know, but if you don't see him soon, he might have one of his severe fits.”</t5999> <t6000>I knew the man wouldn't say this without a reason, so I said, “Alright, I'll go now,” and asked the others to wait for me for a few minutes as I needed to go see my “patient.”</t6000>
<t6001>"Take me with you, my friend John," said the Professor.</t6001> <t6002>"The case in your diary caught my interest and it has occasionally been related to our case as well.</t6002> <t6003>I would very much like to see him, especially when he is mentally unstable.</t6003><t6004>"</t6004>
<t6005>"Can I come too?" asked Lord Godalming.</t6005>
<t6006>“What about me?” said Quincey Morris.</t6006> <t6007>I nodded and we all went down the corridor together.</t6007>
<t6008>We found him in great excitement, but his speech and demeanor were more rational than I had ever seen before.</t6008> <t6009>He had an extraordinary insight unlike anything I had encountered in a mentally ill person before, and he seemed confident that he could outthink others who were entirely sane.</t6009> <t6010>The four of us entered the room at once, but at first, the others said nothing.</t6010> <t6011>What he wanted from me was to discharge him from the mental hospital immediately and send him home.</t6011> <t6012>He supported this with arguments that he was completely cured and presented his current sanity as evidence.</t6012> <t6013>“I appeal to your friends,” he said; “perhaps they will not hesitate to judge my case.</t6013> <t6014>In the meantime, you have not introduced us.”</t6014> <t6015>I was so surprised that the oddity of introducing an inmate of a mental hospital did not occur to me at that moment; moreover, there was a kind of dignity in the man's manner, as if he were equal to the others, and so I immediately performed the introductions: “Lord Godalming; Professor Van Helsing; Mr. Quincey Morris from Texas; Mr. Renfield.”</t6015> <t6016>He shook hands with each and said: “Lord Godalming, I had the honor of testifying for your father in Windham, and I am saddened to understand from your holding the title that he is no longer alive.</t6016> <t6017>He was a man loved and respected by all who knew him, and as I have heard, he was the creator of the much sought-after burnt rum punch on Derby night in his youth.</t6017> <t6018>Mr. Morris, you must be proud of your great state.</t6018> <t6019>The admission of your state to the union will serve as a significant example when the Polar and Tropical Regions are also bound to the United States Flag.</t6019> <t6020>When the Monroe Doctrine takes its rightful place among political truths, the Treaty will prove to be a very broad instrument of growth.</t6020>
<t6021>What can one say about the happiness of meeting Van Helsing?</t6021> <t6022>Sir, I do not apologize for not using traditional prefixes.</t6022> <t6023>When an individual revolutionizes the science of treatment by discovering the constant evolution of the brain, traditional forms become inappropriate, as they seem to limit that person to being a member of a certain class.</t6023> <t6024>I want to testify that I am at least as sane as the majority of those who, like you gentlemen, are fully entitled to the freedoms of holding respectable positions in a dynamic world due to your nationality, hereditary traits, or natural talents.</t6024> <t6025>And I am sure that, besides being a scientist, you, Dr. Seward, who is also a humane person and a forensic expert, will consider it a moral duty to treat me as someone under special circumstances.</t6025> <t6026>He fulfilled his last request with a subtle air of faith that was not devoid of his unique charm.</t6026>
<t6027>I think we were all taken aback.</t6027> <t6028>For my part, despite my knowledge of the man's personality and history, I was of the opinion that he had come to his senses and felt a strong urge to say that I was convinced he was in his right mind and that I would handle the necessary discharge procedures in the morning.</t6028> <t6029>But I thought it would be better to wait before making such a serious statement, because from the past, I knew the sudden changes this patient was prone to.</t6029> <t6030>Therefore, I contented myself with making a general statement that he was making rapid progress and said that I would have a longer conversation with him in the morning and then see what I could do to fulfill his wishes.</t6030> <t6031>This did not satisfy him at all, because he immediately said:</t6031>
<t6032>“But I am afraid, Dr. Seward, that you did not understand my wish very well.</t6032> <t6033>I wish to leave as soon as possible - right now - at this very moment, if possible.</t6033> <t6034>Time is running out, and this is the essence of the contract in our implicit agreement with the old reaper.</t6034> <t6035>I am sure that presenting such a simple, yet at the same time so important, wish to a good doctor like Dr. Seward ensures that it will be fulfilled.”</t6035> <t6036>He looked at me sternly, and upon seeing the negative expression on my face, he turned to the others and examined them carefully.</t6036> <t6037>Not finding a sufficient response, he continued:</t6037>
<t6038>“Is it possible that I was wrong in my assumption?</t6038><t6039>”</t6039>
<t6040>“Yes,” I said plainly, but at the same time, I felt like a savage.</t6040> <t6041>There was a considerable silence, and then he slowly said:</t6041>
<t6042>“Then I must only change the basis of my request.</t6042> <t6043>Let me ask you for this privilege -kindness, favor, whatever you call it.</t6043> <t6044>In such a case, I am willing to plead not for personal reasons, but for the good of others.</t6044> <t6045>I am not free to present all my reasons to you, but I assure you, you can believe that they are good, rational, and selfless reasons, and that they stem from the highest sense of duty.</t6045> <t6046>If you could look into my heart, sir, you would approve of all the feelings that drive me.</t6046> <t6047>Moreover, you would count me among your best and truest friends.”</t6047> <t6048>He looked at us again with piercing eyes.</t6048> <t6049>I had begun to believe that this sudden change in his entire mental approach was another form or phase of his madness; therefore, from past experiences, knowing that like all madmen he would eventually reveal himself, I decided to let him continue speaking a little longer.</t6049> <t6050>Van Helsing was looking at him with great attention; his brush-like eyebrows almost merging with the intensity of his gaze.</t6050> <t6051>In a tone that did not surprise me at the time, but later did when I thought about it -because it was as if he was addressing an equal- he said to Renfield:</t6051>
<t6052>“Won't you honestly tell me the real reason you want to be free tonight?</t6052> <t6053>If you can satisfy even me -a stranger with a habit of being unbiased and open-minded- I promise that Dr. Seward will take the risk and responsibility upon himself and grant you the privilege you seek.”</t6053> <t6054>Renfield shook his head sorrowfully with a sad expression on his face.</t6054> <t6055>The professor continued his words:</t6055>
<t6056>"Come on, sir, think of yourself.</t6056> <t6057>Since you are trying to impress us with your entirely rational attitude, you are claiming the privilege of being the most rational.</t6057> <t6058>By doing this, you are the one we have reason to doubt your sanity because you have not yet emerged from the medical treatment process for this defect.</t6058> <t6059>If you do not help us in our effort to choose the wisest path, how can we fulfill the task you have assigned to us?</t6059> <t6060>Be smart and help us; we, in turn, will help you achieve your wish if we can."</t6060> <t6061>But Renfield shook his head again and said:</t6061>
<t6062>"Dr. Van Helsing, I have nothing to say.</t6062> <t6063>Your argument is complete, and if I had the freedom to speak, I wouldn't hesitate for a moment, but in this matter, I am not my own master.</t6063> <t6064>All I can do is ask you to trust me.</t6064> <t6065>If I am refused, the responsibility is not mine."</t6065> <t6066>I thought it was time to end this scene, which was becoming absurdly serious; so as I walked towards the door, I said:</t6066>
<t6067>“Come, my friends, we have work to do.</t6067> <t6068>Good night.</t6068><t6069>”</t6069>
<t6070>But as I approached the door, there was a new change in the patient.</t6070> <t6071>He came at me with such speed that I feared, at that moment, he would attempt murder again.</t6071> <t6072>But my fears were unfounded, because he extended both hands in supplication and demonstrated his plea through action.</t6072> <t6073>When he saw that the intensity of his emotions, by rekindling our past relations, was working against him, he became even more emotional.</t6073> <t6074>I looked at Van Helsing and saw my view reflected in his eyes; therefore, in my demeanor, I became a bit more resolute, if not more stubborn, and indicated that his efforts were in vain.</t6074> <t6075>I had previously seen the same, ever-growing excitement when he was about to make a request he had long pondered, as when he wanted a cat; this time, I was ready to see the same gloomy acceptance.</t6075> <t6076>My expectation did not come true, because when he realized his plea would not succeed, he went mad.</t6076> <t6077>He threw himself on his knees, raised his hands in a tearful plea, tears streaming down his cheeks, and his entire face and body expressing his deepest emotions, he poured out a torrent of supplication:</t6077>
<t6078>“I beg you, Dr. Seward, to get me out of here as soon as possible, I implore you.</t6078> <t6079>Send me away however and wherever you can; send me with guards armed with whips and chains; put me in a straitjacket, handcuff me, even shackle me in a prison, but let me get out of here.</t6079> <t6080>You don't know what you're doing by keeping me here.</t6080> <t6081>I am speaking from the depths of my heart -from the very depths of my soul.</t6081> <t6082>You don't know whom or how you are harming, and I cannot explain it to you.</t6082> <t6083>Alas, what a pity!</t6083> <t6084>I cannot explain.</t6084> <t6085>In the name of everything you hold sacred -in the name of everything you love- in the name of the love you have lost -in the name of the hope that still lives- for the love of God, get me out of here and save my soul from guilt!</t6085> <t6086>Can't you hear me, man?</t6086> <t6087>Don't you understand?</t6087> <t6088>Will you never learn?</t6088> <t6089>Don't you understand that I am now sane and sincere, that I am no longer a madman having a fit of insanity, that I am a sane man fighting for his soul?</t6089> <t6090>Oh, listen to me!</t6090> <t6091>Listen to me!</t6091> <t6092>Let me go!</t6092> <t6093>Let me go!</t6093> <t6094>Let me go!</t6094><t6095>”</t6095>
<t6096>As this situation dragged on, I thought he would become even more savage and thus cause a fit, so I took his hand and helped him up.</t6096>
<t6097>"Come," I said sternly, "this is enough, we've listened enough now.</t6097> <t6098>Go to your bed and try to behave more sensibly.</t6098><t6099>"</t6099>
<t6100>Suddenly, he fell silent and looked at me attentively for a few seconds.</t6100> <t6101>Then, without saying a word, he stood up and walked over to sit on the edge of the bed.</t6101> <t6102>Just as I expected, he collapsed as he had in previous instances.</t6102>
<t6103>Ben, as he left the room from the very back of our group, said in a quiet and noble voice:</t6103>
<t6104>"I hope, Dr. Seward, that later on, you will show the fairness to remember that I did my best to convince you tonight."</t6104><t6105>"</t6105>

<t6108>October 1st, 5 AM.</t6108> <t6109>- I joined the search with the group with peace of mind, because I think I have never seen Mina so strong and well before.</t6109> <t6110>I am very pleased that she agreed to stay behind and let us men do the work.</t6110> <t6111>For some reason, it was horrifying for me to have her involved in this dreadful task, but now that her duty is over and thanks to her energy, intellect, and foresight, the whole story has been brought together in a way that every point is explained, she can understand that her role is over and she can now leave the remaining work to us.</t6111> <t6112>I think we were all shaken up because of the scene we experienced with Mr. Renfield.</t6112> <t6113>When we left his room, we didn't speak until we returned to the study.</t6113> <t6114>Then Mr. Morris said to Dr. Seward: “Tell me Jack, if that man wasn't bluffing, he is almost the sanest madman I've ever seen until today.</t6114> <t6115>I'm not sure, but I believe he had a serious purpose, and if so, it must have been very hard for him not to get a chance.” Lord Godalming and I remained silent, but Dr. Van Helsing added:</t6115>
<t6116>“My friend John, you know more lunatics than I do and for that I am glad, but I fear, if it had been up to me, I would have released him before that final outburst where he lost control.</t6116> <t6117>But we live and learn, and in our current task, as our friend Quincey would say, we must not leave anything to chance.</t6117> <t6118>As it stands, everything is fine.” Dr. Seward seemed distracted as he responded to both of them:</t6118>
<t6119>“I won't be able to do anything except say that I agree with you.</t6119> <t6120>If that man had been an ordinary lunatic, I would have taken the risk of trusting him, but he seems so involved in the Count's affairs - through some kind of espionage - that I fear I might be doing wrong by aiding his madness.</t6120> <t6121>I cannot forget how he begged with almost the same fervor to get a cat and then tried to tear my throat with his teeth.</t6121> <t6122>Moreover, he refers to the Count as 'My Lord' and 'Master' and might want to get out of here to help him in some diabolical way.</t6122> <t6123>That dreadful thing has wolves, rats, and his own kind to help him, so I don't think he would hesitate to use a respectable lunatic.</t6123> <t6124>Still, it is true that he seems sincere.</t6124> <t6125>I only hope we are doing the right thing.</t6125> <t6126>These things, along with the wild task at hand, are enough to unnerve a person.”</t6126> <t6127>The Professor walked towards him and, placing his hand on his shoulder, said seriously and kindly:</t6127>
<t6128>“My friend John, do not be afraid.</t6128> <t6129>We are trying to do our duty in a very sad and terrible case, we can only do what we think is best.</t6129> <t6130>What else can we hope for but the mercy of Almighty God?” Lord Godalming had left us for a few minutes in silence and had now returned.</t6130> <t6131>Showing a small, silver whistle, he said:</t6131>
<t6132>“The old house might be full of mice, if so, I have a ready-made remedy.”</t6132> <t6133>We headed towards the house, passing through the wall, taking care to stay in the shadows of the trees on the lawn as the moonlight shone.</t6133> <t6134>When we reached the terrace, the Professor opened his bag and took out a lot of things; he placed them on the stairs and divided them into four groups, clearly one for each of us.</t6134> <t6135>Then he started to speak:</t6135>
<t6136>“My friends, we are venturing into a terrible danger and we need every kind of weapon.</t6136> <t6137>Our enemy is not just spiritual.</t6137> <t6138>He possesses the strength of twenty men, and while our necks and windpipes are ordinary - and therefore breakable and crushable - his are not affected by mere physical strength.</t6138> <t6139>A man stronger than him or a group of men collectively stronger than him can sometimes hold him, but they cannot hurt him as he can hurt us.</t6139> <t6140>Therefore, we must protect ourselves from his touch.</t6140> <t6141>Keep this close to your heart,” - as he said this, he took out a small silver cross and handed it to me since I was the closest - “Wear these flowers around your neck,” - Here he gave me a garland made of withered garlic flowers - “for more ordinary enemies, this gun and this knife, and to help with everything, these small electric lamps you can attach to your chest, and finally, most importantly, this weapon that we must not disrespect unnecessarily.”</t6141> <t6142>This was a piece of consecrated bread that he placed in an envelope and handed to me.</t6142> <t6143>The others were equipped in the same manner.</t6143> <t6144>“Now,” he said, “my friend John, where are the lock picks?</t6144> <t6145>So, we don’t need to enter the house through the window as we did before with Miss Lucy’s; we can open the door.</t6145><t6146>”</t6146>
<t6147>Dr. Seward tried a couple of lockpicks; his mechanical dexterity as a surgeon came in handy.</t6147> <t6148>After a while, he found one that worked, and after a bit of back-and-forth pushing, the lock tongue yielded and turned with a rusty clank.</t6148> <t6149>We pushed the door, the rusty hinges creaked, and the door slowly opened.</t6149> <t6150>In an eerie manner, it resembled the way Dr. Seward described the opening of Miss Westenra's tomb in his journal; I think the same thought occurred to the others because, as if in agreement, they stepped back.</t6150> <t6151>The first to advance was the Professor, and he stepped inside through the door.</t6151>
<t6152>“Into your hands, Lord!” I said, crossing myself as I stepped over the threshold.</t6152> <t6153>We closed the door behind us, fearing that lighting our lamps might attract the attention of passersby.</t6153> <t6154>The professor carefully tested the door, concerned that in our haste to leave, we might not be able to open it from the inside.</t6154> <t6155>Then we all lit our lamps and began our investigation.</t6155>
<t6156>The lights of the small lamps were transforming into strange shapes as the beams intersected with each other or as our bodies cast large shadows due to their opacity.</t6156> <t6157>Despite my efforts, I couldn't shake the feeling that there was someone else among us.</t6157> <t6158>I think this was because the terrifying environment we were in strongly reminded me of that horrific experience in Transylvania.</t6158> <t6159>I believe this feeling was true for all of us, because I noticed that, just like me, the others kept looking over their shoulders at every sound and every new shadow.</t6159>
<t6160>The entire place was covered with a thick layer of dust.</t6160> <t6161>The floor seemed to be a few centimeters deep, except for the places where there were fresh footprints, where I could see blunt nail marks among the solidified piles of dust when I held my lamp downwards.</t6161> <t6162>The walls were covered and swollen with dust, and in the corners, there were clusters of cobwebs so dusty that they looked like old, worn-out carpets partially torn by the weight of the dust.</t6162> <t6163>On the table in the hallway, there was a large bunch of keys, each with a yellowed tag over time.</t6163> <t6164>They had been used many times, as there were numerous disturbances in the dust cover on the table similar to those that appeared when the Professor lifted them.</t6164> <t6165>The Professor turned to me and said:</t6165>
<t6166>“You know this place, Jonathan.</t6166> <t6167>You had copied the plan of this place and you have more information than at least we do.</t6167> <t6168>Which way leads to the chapel?”</t6168> <t6169>Although I couldn't enter during my previous visit, I had an idea about the direction of the chapel; therefore, I acted as a guide and after a few wrong turns, I found myself in front of a low, arched, oak door with iron embossing.</t6169> <t6170>“Here it is,” said the Professor, turning his lamp to the small plan I had copied from the file containing my letters about purchasing the house.</t6170> <t6171>We found the key in the bunch without much trouble and opened the door.</t6171> <t6172>We were prepared for some unpleasant situations, because as the door opened, it seemed as if a slight, foul smell was coming from the gap, but none of us expected to encounter such a smell when we faced it.</t6172> <t6173>None of the others had encountered the Count this closely, and I had seen him either in his room during his hunger phase or in an open, ruined building in the pleasure of fresh blood, but here the room was small and airless, and its long disuse had made the air foul and malodorous.</t6173> <t6174>From the even worse smelling air came a dry, germy, earthy smell.</t6174> <t6175>But as for the smell itself, how can I describe it?</t6175> <t6176>It not only consisted of every kind of ailment of mortality and the sharp, acrid smell of blood, but also, as if decay itself had decayed.</t6176> <t6177>Ah! Thinking about it makes me sick.</t6177> <t6178>It was as if every breath the monster took had clung to the place and intensified its repulsiveness.</t6178>
<t6179>Under ordinary circumstances, such a foul smell would have ended our endeavor, but this was no ordinary case, and the sacred, dreadful purpose we were involved in gave us a power that overcame mere physical factors.</t6179> <t6180>After the involuntary first breath that made us nauseous, we all set to work as if that disgusting place were a rose garden.</t6180>
<t6181>We carefully examined the place; as we began the examination, the Professor said:</t6181>
<t6182>“The first task is to see how many crates are left; the next task is to examine every hole, corner, and nook to see if we can find any clues about what happened to the other crates.”</t6182> <t6183>A single glance was enough to see how many were left because the large earthen crates were very big, and it was impossible to be mistaken about this.</t6183>
<t6184>Only twenty-nine of the coffins were there.</t6184> <t6185>At one point, I was startled because Lord Godalming suddenly turned and looked into the dark corridor extending beyond the arched doorway; I looked too, and for a moment, my heart stopped.</t6185> <t6186>Somewhere, when I focused on the shadow, it seemed to me that I saw the prominent features of the Count's demonic face, the protrusion of his nose, his red eyes, his red lips, his terrifying pallor.</t6186> <t6187>This lasted only a moment because Lord Godalming said, "I thought I saw a face, but it was only a shadow," and when he returned to his examination, I turned my lamp in that direction and entered the corridor.</t6187> <t6188>There was no sign of anyone; there couldn't have been a place for anyone to hide because there were no corners, doors, or gaps, only the solid walls of the corridor.</t6188> <t6189>I concluded that fear had aided my imagination and said nothing.</t6189>
<t6190>A few minutes later, I saw Morris suddenly pull back from a corner he was examining.</t6190> <t6191>We all watched his movements with our eyes, because undoubtedly a kind of unease was descending upon all of us, and we saw a pile of phosphorescence shining like a star.</t6191> <t6192>Instinctively, we all pulled back.</t6192> <t6193>The entire place was coming alive with rats.</t6193>
<t6194>For a moment, all of us were struck with horror, except for Lord Godalming, who seemed prepared for such an emergency.</t6194> <t6195>Dr. Seward ran to the iron-embossed oak door he had described and I had seen from the outside, turned the key in the lock, pulled the large bolt, and opened the door.</t6195> <t6196>Then, he took a small silver whistle from his pocket and blew a low, sharp note.</t6196> <t6197>This sound was answered by barking dogs from behind Dr. Seward's house, and within a minute, three terriers came running around the corner of the house.</t6197> <t6198>Unconsciously, we all walked towards the door, and as we moved, I noticed that the dust was greatly disturbed: the boxes that had been taken out were carried through this way.</t6198> <t6199>But in that one minute, the number of rats had greatly increased.</t6199> <t6200>The light of the lamp shining on their dark bodies and bright, sinister eyes made the place look like a mound of earth adorned with fireflies as they swarmed there quickly.</t6200> <t6201>The dogs ran quickly, but suddenly stopped at the threshold of the door, growled, and then simultaneously lifted their noses and began to bark sharply.</t6201> <t6202>The number of rats was increasing by the thousands, and we went outside.</t6202>
<t6203>Lord Godalming picked up one of the dogs and carried it inside, laying it down on the ground.</t6203> <t6204>As soon as the dog's feet touched the ground, it seemed to regain its former courage and leapt at its natural enemies.</t6204> <t6205>The rats fled so quickly from the dogs that the first dog to enter took the lives of twenty, and when the other dogs were brought in the same way, there was only a small group of rats left to hunt.</t6205> <t6206>With their departure, it seemed as if the evil presence had also left, for the dogs wagged their tails and barked joyfully as they made sudden attacks on their weakened enemies, flipping them over and shaking them violently before tossing them into the air.</t6206> <t6207>It seemed as if all our spirits had lifted.</t6207> <t6208>I don't know if it was the opening of the chapel door that cleared the deadly air or the relief of finding ourselves in the open, but the shadow of great fear had certainly flowed away from us like a veil, and although our resolve had not diminished in the slightest, the dreadful significance of our reason for coming here had somewhat lessened.</t6208> <t6209>We closed, bolted, and locked the outer door, and began to search the house with the dogs by our side.</t6209> <t6210>We found nothing except an extraordinary amount of dust, and nothing had been disturbed except my own footprints from my first visit.</t6210> <t6211>The dogs did not show a single sign of unease, and even when we returned to the chapel, they wagged their tails as if they were hunting rabbits in the forest during the summer.</t6211>
<t6212>When we stepped out the door, the day was coming to life from the east.</t6212> <t6213>Dr. Van Helsing had taken the key to the hall door from the bunch, and after properly locking the door and finishing his task, he put the key in his pocket.</t6213>
<t6214>“So far,” he said, “our night has been extremely successful.</t6214> <t6215>None of us have been harmed as I feared, and yet we have determined how many crates are missing.</t6215> <t6216>What pleases me even more is that our first - and perhaps most difficult and dangerous - step has been accomplished without disturbing our sweet Madam Mina with the terrifying sounds and smells that she would never forget, whether awake or asleep, before bringing her here.</t6216> <t6217>We have learned another lesson, if we can discuss it in particular: That is, these wild animals under the Count's command do not yet possess his spiritual power, because look, just like the wolves that appeared upon your departure from the castle or the ones that came out upon the poor mother's scream, these rats that came at his call, even if they came by his command, fled hastily from our friend Arthur's tiny dogs.</t6217> <t6218>There are other matters, other dangers, other fears ahead of us, and that monster - he did not use his power over animals for the first or last time tonight.</t6218> <t6219>Well, let him have gone somewhere else.</t6219> <t6220>Good! This situation has given us the opportunity to shout 'Check!' in this chess game we are playing for the human soul in some way.</t6220> <t6221>Let's go home now.</t6221> <t6222>Dawn is approaching, and we have reason to be pleased with our work on the first night.</t6222> <t6223>If it is full of dangers, we may have many more nights and days to follow, but we must continue and fear no danger.</t6223><t6224>”</t6224>
<t6225>When we returned, the house was silent except for a wretched creature screaming in one of the distant wards and a low, moaning sound coming from Renfield's room.</t6225> <t6226>The poor man was undoubtedly torturing himself with unnecessary thoughts that would cause pain, in a manner consistent with the behavior of the insane.</t6226>
<t6227>When I tiptoed into our room, Mina was asleep; she was breathing so softly that I had to lean in to hear it.</t6227> <t6228>She looks paler than usual.</t6228> <t6229>I hope tonight's meeting hasn't upset her.</t6229> <t6230>I'm grateful that she is kept out of our future work and even our own discussions.</t6230> <t6231>This is too much tension for a woman to bear.</t6231> <t6232>I didn't think so at first, but now I understand better.</t6232> <t6233>Therefore, I am glad that it was decided this way.</t6233> <t6234>There might be things she would be afraid to hear; yet, if she suspects there is a secret, hiding it from her could be worse than telling it.</t6234> <t6235>From now on, our duty, at the very least, should be to remain a sealed book to her until the time comes when we can tell her that everything is over and the world is rid of a monster from hell.</t6235> <t6236>I think it will be hard to start keeping silent after the trust between us, but I will act decisively and tomorrow, I will not reveal any secrets about what happened tonight and will refuse to talk about it.</t6236> <t6237>I'm sleeping on the couch so as not to disturb her.</t6237>
<t6238>October 1, later.</t6238> <t6239>- I suppose it is natural for all of us to have slept more than usual, because the day had been intense and we had not rested at all during the night.</t6239> <t6240>Even Mina must have felt her exhaustion, for although I slept until the sun was up, I had risen before her and had to call her two or three times before she woke up.</t6240> <t6241>Indeed, she slept so deeply that for a few seconds she did not recognize me and looked at me with a kind of empty terror, as someone awakened from a bad dream might do.</t6241> <t6242>She complained of feeling a bit tired, and I allowed her to rest until later in the day.</t6242> <t6243>We now know that twenty-one crates have been moved, and if most of them were transported together in these operations, we can trace them.</t6243> <t6244>Such a situation, of course, will make our task easier, and the sooner the matter is resolved, the better.</t6244> <t6245>Today I will visit Thomas Snelling.</t6245>
<t6246>Dr. Seward's journal</t6246>
<t6247>October 1st.</t6247> <t6248>- When the Professor entered my room and woke me up, it was almost noon.</t6248> <t6249>He looked happier and more cheerful than usual, and it was clear that last night's work had lifted some of the burden of dark thoughts from his mind.</t6249> <t6250>After going over the night's adventure, he suddenly said:</t6250>
<t6251>“Your patient interests me a lot.</t6251> <t6252>Can I come with you to visit him this morning?</t6252> <t6253>Or if you are very busy, I can go alone if possible.</t6253> <t6254>Finding a mental patient who talks philosophy and reasons so healthily is a new experience for me.”</t6254> <t6255>I had some tasks to attend to, so I told him I would be pleased if he went alone, so I wouldn't have to keep him waiting later; I called a nurse and gave the necessary instructions.</t6255> <t6256>Before the professor left the room, I warned him not to get any wrong impressions from my patient.</t6256> <t6257>“But,” he said, “I want to hear him talk about himself and his madness about eating live things.</t6257> <t6258>From yesterday's part of the journal, I understand that he once told Madam Mina about such a belief.</t6258> <t6259>Why are you laughing, my friend Jonathan?</t6259><t6260>”</t6260>
<t6261>"Excuse me," I said, "but the answer is here."</t6261><t6262>I placed my hand on the typewritten draft.</t6262><t6263>"Our sane and educated madman, while explaining how he once had a habit of eating life, had the repulsiveness of the flies and spiders he ate just before Ms. Harker entered the room lingering in his mouth."</t6263><t6264>Van Helsing smiled at me.</t6264><t6265>"Good!" he said.</t6265><t6266>"Your memory does not deceive you, my friend John.</t6266><t6267>I should have remembered that.</t6267><t6268>But still, what makes the study of mental illness such a fascinating field is the way thought and memory can go astray like this.</t6268><t6269>Perhaps I can gain more knowledge from this man's madness than from the teachings of the wisest person.</t6269><t6270>Who knows?"</t6270><t6271>I continued my work and finished what I had in hand shortly thereafter.</t6271><t6272>Indeed, it seemed like a very short time, but Van Helsing had already returned to the study room.</t6272><t6273>"Am I disturbing you?" he asked politely, standing at the door.</t6273>
<t6274>“Absolutely not,” I replied.</t6274> <t6275>“Come in.</t6275> <t6276>I'm done with my work and now I'm free.</t6276> <t6277>If you want, I can come with you now.</t6277><t6278>”</t6278>
<t6279>"No need; I saw him!"</t6279><t6280>"</t6280>
<t6281>“So, what do you think?</t6281><t6282>”</t6282>
<t6283>“I'm afraid he doesn't like me very much.</t6283> <t6284>Our meeting was brief.</t6284> <t6285>When I entered his room, he was sitting on a stool in the middle of the room, with his elbows resting on his knees and a sullen expression of discontent on his face.</t6285> <t6286>I spoke to him as cheerfully and respectfully as I could.</t6286> <t6287>He didn't respond at all, 'I know you well enough, you are the old fool Van Helsing.'</t6287> <t6288>I wish you would take yourself and your foolish brain theories somewhere else.</t6288> <t6289>Damn all thick-headed Dutchmen!' He didn't say another word, but with his endless sulkiness, he sat there indifferently as if I wasn't even in the room.</t6289> <t6290>Thus, this time, my chance to learn much from such a clever lunatic slipped away; therefore, if possible, I will speak a few happy words with that sweet Madam Mina to lift my spirits.</t6290> <t6291>My friend John, it makes me indescribably happy that she is no longer being tormented or worried by our dreadful affairs.</t6291> <t6292>Though we will miss her help greatly, it's for the best.</t6292><t6293>”</t6293>
<t6294>“I agree with you wholeheartedly,” I replied sincerely, because I did not want him to soften on this matter.</t6294> <t6295>“It is better for Ms. Harker to stay out of this issue.</t6295> <t6296>Things are bad enough for us, who have seen and experienced a lot and have been in very difficult places in our time, but this is no place for a woman and if she had anything to do with this, it would undoubtedly destroy her over time.</t6296><t6297>”</t6297>
<t6298>Thus, Van Helsing went to meet with Ms. Harker and Mr. Harker; Quincey and Art are doing their best to track down the soil boxes.</t6298> <t6299>I will finish my work and meet with them tonight.</t6299>
<t6300>Mina Harker's diary</t6300>
<t6301>October 1st.</t6301> <t6302>- It feels strange to me not to be informed as I was today; after Jonathan's endless trust over the years, to avoid certain topics and the most crucial ones so openly!</t6302> <t6303>After yesterday's exhaustion, I slept in late this morning, and although Jonathan got up late as well, he was up earlier than me.</t6303> <t6304>Before leaving, he spoke to me in a sweeter and softer manner than ever before, but did not say a single word about what happened during the visit to the Count's house.</t6304> <t6305>But still, he must have known how worried I was.</t6305> <t6306>Poor dear man!</t6306> <t6307>I think this situation must have upset him even more than it upset me.</t6307> <t6308>They all decided together that I should not be drawn further into this dreadful matter, and I did not oppose it.</t6308> <t6309>But to think that he is hiding something from me!</t6309> <t6310>And now, even though I know it stems from my husband's great love and the good, good intentions of those other strong men, I am crying like a fool...</t6310>
<t6311>This did me good.</t6311> <t6312>One day Jonathan will tell me everything, and so that he doesn't think I'm hiding anything from him for even a moment, as always, I'm keeping my journal.</t6312> <t6313>Then, if he doubts my trust, I will show him every thought that comes from my heart written down, so that his dear eyes can read them.</t6313> <t6314>Today, I feel strangely sad and listless.</t6314> <t6315>It must be a reaction to that horrific excitement.</t6315>
<t6316>Last night, when the men left, I went to bed just because they told me to do so.</t6316><t6317>I wasn't sleepy and I felt a consuming anxiety.</t6317><t6318>Since the day Jonathan came to London to see me, I kept reviewing everything that happened, and everything seems like a horrifying tragedy, as if fate is relentlessly pushing towards a predetermined end.</t6318><t6319>Everything done, no matter how right, seems to cause the very thing we find the worst.</t6319><t6320>If I hadn't gone to Whitby, perhaps dear poor Lucy could be here with us today.</t6320><t6321>If she hadn't gone to visit the churchyard until I came, and if she hadn't gone there with me during the day, she wouldn't have walked there in her sleep, and if she hadn't gone there in her sleep at night, that monster couldn't have destroyed her like this.</t6321><t6322>Oh, why did I go to Whitby?</t6322><t6323>Here I am, crying again!</t6323><t6324>I don't know what happened to me today.</t6324><t6325>I must hide this from Jonathan, because if he learns that I cried twice this morning - I, who never cry on my own and Jonathan has never caused me to shed a single tear - the poor man would be devastated with worry.</t6325><t6326>I must put on a brave face, and if I feel like crying, he must never know.</t6326><t6327>I think this is one of the lessons we poor women must learn...</t6327>
<t6328>I can't remember how I fell asleep last night.</t6328> <t6329>I remember suddenly hearing dogs barking and a lot of strange noises coming from Mr. Renfield's room somewhere below this room, as if someone was praying very loudly.</t6329> <t6330>And then, silence fell over everything, a silence so deep that it frightened me, and I got up to look out the window.</t6330> <t6331>Everything was dark and quiet, and the dark shadows cast by the moonlight seemed filled with their own mystery.</t6331> <t6332>Not a single thing was moving, everything seemed as terrible and still as death or fate; so much so that the thin line of white mist that seemed to be crawling towards the house across the grass at an almost imperceptible speed seemed to have a consciousness and life of its own.</t6332> <t6333>I think it did me good to get away from the subject because when I returned to bed, a heaviness had settled over me.</t6333> <t6334>I lay down for a while, but I couldn't sleep much, so I got up again and looked out the window.</t6334> <t6335>The mist was spreading and had now come very close to the house, so much so that I could see it clinging to the wall in a thick layer as if it were secretly reaching for the windows.</t6335> <t6336>The poor man was making more noise than ever, and although I couldn't distinguish a single word he was saying, I could detect a peculiar passionate plea in his voice.</t6336> <t6337>Then, the sound of a struggle came; I knew the nurses were attending to him.</t6337> <t6338>I was so scared that I crawled into bed and covered my head with the blankets, plugging my ears with my fingers.</t6338> <t6339>At that moment, I wasn't sleepy at all, or at least I thought so; but I must have fallen asleep because I don't remember anything until Jonathan woke me up in the morning, except for the dreams I had.</t6339> <t6340>I think it took me some effort and time to understand where I was and to realize that it was Jonathan leaning over me.</t6340> <t6341>My dream was quite unusual and was almost an example of thoughts conceived while awake blending into or continuing in the dream.</t6341>
<t6342>I thought I was asleep and waiting for Jonathan to arrive.</t6342> <t6343>I was very worried about him and had no strength to move; my feet, hands, and mind were heavy, so nothing could progress at its usual pace.</t6343> <t6344>Because of this, I slept a troubled sleep and thought.</t6344> <t6345>Then, it occurred to me that the air was heavy, humid, and cold.</t6345> <t6346>I covered my face with the blankets again and, in astonishment, saw that my surroundings were dim.</t6346> <t6347>The gas lamp I had left on for Jonathan but then dimmed, clearly appeared like a tiny red dot in the thickening mist seeping into the room.</t6347> <t6348>Then, I remembered that I had closed the window before getting into bed.</t6348> <t6349>Actually, I would have gotten up to be sure, but a kind of leaden weight seemed to chain my arms, legs, and even my will.</t6349> <t6350>I lay still and endured it; that was all; I closed my eyes but could still see through my eyelids.</t6350> <t6351>(How marvelous are the tricks our dreams play on us and our ability to imagine accordingly.</t6351><t6352>)</t6352> <t6353>As the mist thickened more and more, I could now see how it was entering because it was seeping in not from the window but from the joints of the door, like smoke - or the white steam of boiling water.</t6353> <t6354>It continued to thicken until it seemed to form a column of cloud in the room, at the top of which I could see the gas lamp glowing like a red eye.</t6354> <t6355>The things in my head were swirling around just like the cloudy column in the room; among this, the phrase "Pillar of cloud by day, pillar of fire by night" from the Holy Bible came to mind.</t6355> <t6356>Was it really a kind of spiritual guide coming to me in my sleep?</t6356> <t6357>But this column was composed of both the guidance of night and day, because the fire, which gained a new allure for me upon reflection, was in the red eye; until, as I watched, the fire split and shone through the mist above me, just like the two red eyes Lucy mentioned during her momentary mental lapse when the setting sun's light hit the windows of Saint Mary Church on the slope.</t6357> <t6358>Suddenly, I was terrified, remembering that Jonathan had seen those dreadful women transform from mist into reality in the moonlight.</t6358> <t6359>The last conscious effort of my imagination was a very angry white face emerging from the mist and leaning over me.</t6359> <t6360>I must be careful of such dreams, for if they become numerous, they can take one's mind.</t6360> <t6361>If I weren't afraid of worrying them, I would ask Dr. Van Helsing or Dr. Seward to prescribe me a sleeping aid.</t6361> <t6362>Such a dream right now would be woven into the fears they have for me.</t6362> <t6363>Tonight, I will try to sleep naturally.</t6363> <t6364>If I can't sleep, I will have them give me a dose of chloral tomorrow night; using it once won't harm me, and it will give me a good night's sleep.</t6364> <t6365>Last night tired me so much that I wouldn't be this exhausted even if I hadn't slept at all.</t6365>
<t6366>2</t6366> <t6367>October, 10 PM.</t6367> <t6368>- I slept last night, but I didn't dream.</t6368> <t6369>I must have slept deeply; I didn't wake up when Jonathan came to bed; but the sleep didn't refresh me, because today I feel terribly weak and unwell.</t6369> <t6370>Yesterday, I spent the whole day either trying to read or lying down and dozing.</t6370> <t6371>In the afternoon, Mr. Renfield asked if he could see me.</t6371> <t6372>The poor man was very kind and kissed my hand, wishing God's protection upon me as he left.</t6372> <t6373>This affected me greatly in some way; whenever I think of him, I cry.</t6373> <t6374>This is a new weakness I need to be careful about.</t6374> <t6375>If Jonathan knew I was crying, he would be devastated.</t6375> <t6376>He and the others were out until dinner and they all returned tired.</t6376> <t6377>I did my best to cheer them up and I think this effort did me good, because I forgot how tired I was.</t6377> <t6378>After dinner, they sent me to bed and said they were all going out to smoke together, but I knew they wanted to tell each other what had happened to them during the day; from Jonathan's demeanor, I could see he had something important he wanted to share.</t6378> <t6379>I wasn't as sleepy as I should have been; therefore, before they left, I asked Dr. Seward to give me some kind of sleeping medicine because I hadn't slept well the previous night.</t6379> <t6380>He kindly prepared a sleeping draught for me, assuring me it was very mild and wouldn't harm me...</t6380> <t6381>I took the medicine and am still waiting for the distant sleep to come.</t6381> <t6382>I hope I haven't made a mistake because when sleep starts to court me, a new fear arises: I hope I haven't been foolish by depriving myself of the power to wake up.</t6382> <t6383>I might want to wake up.</t6383> <t6384>Here comes sleep.</t6384> <t6385>Good night.</t6385>
<t6386>XX</t6386>
<t6387>Jonathan Harker's journal</t6387>
<t6388>October 1, evening.</t6388> <t6389>I found Thomas Snelling at his home in Benthal Green, but unfortunately, he was in no condition to remember anything.</t6389> <t6390>Knowing that I would go there and give him beer money had tempted him, and he had gotten drunk early.</t6390> <t6391>However, from his wife, who seemed to be an honest, poor woman, I learned that the man carried the boxes together and that the authoritative Smollet was merely his assistant.</t6391> <t6392>Therefore, I went by carriage to Walworth and found Mr. Joseph Smollet at home, with his jacket off, drinking tea from a saucer.</t6392> <t6393>An honest and intelligent man, evidently a good and reliable worker, with a mind of his own.</t6393> <t6394>He remembered the entire incident regarding the boxes and gave the destinations of the boxes from a perfect notebook with curled corners, which he took out from a mysterious pocket at the back of his trousers, containing thick, semi-faded hieroglyph-like notes written with a pencil.</t6394> <t6395>He said there were six boxes he picked up from Carfax and loaded into the carriage, which he left at 197 Chicksand Street, Mile End New Town, and another six boxes he left at Jamaica Road, Bermondsey.</t6395> <t6396>If the Count intends to distribute these hideous refuges all over London, these places were chosen as the first delivery points, so that he could complete the distribution in more detail later.</t6396> <t6397>This systematic approach in the execution of this task made me think that he did not intend to limit himself to the two sides of London.</t6397> <t6398>Now he had settled at the eastern end of the north shore and the eastern end of the south shore and to the south.</t6398> <t6399>The north and west were never meant to be excluded from his diabolical plan - especially not the very center of the city and the favored parts of London, the southwest, and the southern hub.</t6399> <t6400>I started talking to Smollet again and asked him if he could tell me whether there were any other boxes taken from Carfax.</t6400>
<t6401>He answered like this:</t6401>
<t6402>"Well boss, you treated me very well," -I had given him half a gold coin- "and I will tell you everything I know.</t6402> <t6403>I heard a man named Bloxam telling his friend at the Hare and Hounds Tavern in Pincher’s Alley about four nights ago that he did a very dusty job at the old house in Purfleet.</t6403> <t6404>There aren't many such jobs around here, and I think maybe Sam Bloxam can tell you something."</t6404> <t6405>I asked him where I could find this man.</t6405> <t6406>I told him that if he could find the address for me, it would be worth another half gold coin.</t6406> <t6407>So, he finished the rest of his tea in one gulp and stood up, saying he would start investigating right away.</t6407> <t6408>He stopped at the door and said:</t6408>
<t6409>“Listen, boss, there's no point in keeping you here.</t6409> <t6410>I might find Sam soon or I might not, but in any case, he won't be able to tell you much tonight.</t6410> <t6411>When Sam starts drinking, he becomes quite a rare character.</t6411> <t6412>If you can give me an envelope with a stamp and your address on it, I can find out where Sam might be tonight and mail it to you.</t6412> <t6413>But you'd better start looking for him early in the morning or you might not catch him, because Sam gets up early no matter how much he drank the night before.</t6413><t6414>”</t6414>
<t6415>This was very convenient; thus, one of the children went to get an envelope and a sheet of paper with a penny and kept the change for themselves.</t6415> <t6416>When the girl came back, I wrote the address on the envelope and stuck the stamp, and after Smollet once again promised to mail it when he found the address, I headed home.</t6416> <t6417>One way or another, we are on the trail.</t6417> <t6418>I am tired tonight and want to sleep.</t6418> <t6419>Mina is in a deep sleep and looks a bit too pale; her eyes look as if she has been crying.</t6419> <t6420>Poor darling, I have no doubt that the thought of secrets being kept from her worries her; this might cause her to worry twice as much for me and the others.</t6420> <t6421>But this is for the best.</t6421> <t6422>Experiencing disappointment and worry in this way is better than having her nerves shattered.</t6422> <t6423>I must be resolute as I carry this special burden of silence on my shoulders.</t6423> <t6424>Under no circumstances should I discuss this matter with her.</t6424> <t6425>To be honest, this might not be a difficult task, as she has been reticent about this matter for a while and has not spoken about the Count or his actions since we explained our decision to her.</t6425>
<t6426>2</t6426> <t6427>October, evening.</t6427> <t6428>- A long, challenging, and exciting day.</t6428> <t6429>With the first mail, an envelope arrived with a dirty piece of paper stuffed inside, previously addressed; on the paper, written with a carpenter's pencil and in large handwriting, it said:</t6429>
<t6430>Sam Bloxam, Korkrans, Poters Square, Bartel Street, No: 4 Walworth.</t6430> <t6431>Ask for the assistant.</t6431>
<t6432>I had received the letter while I was in bed and got up without waking Mina.</t6432> <t6433>She was like in a daze, sleepy and pale, and she didn't look well at all.</t6433> <t6434>I had decided not to wake her, but when I return from this new investigation, I will make arrangements for her return to Exeter.</t6434> <t6435>I think she will be happier in her own home, engaged with her own daily affairs, unaware of everything happening here between us.</t6435> <t6436>I only saw Dr. Seward for a moment and told him where I was going, promising to come back and tell the others as soon as I found something.</t6436> <t6437>I went to Walworth by car and, with some difficulty, found Poters Square.</t6437> <t6438>Mr. Smollet's poor handwriting had misled me because I had asked for Poter's Square instead of Potter's Square.</t6438> <t6439>But once I found the square, I had no trouble discovering the Corcoran Boarding House.</t6439> <t6440>When I asked the man who came to the door for the "assistant," he shook his head and said, "I don't know.</t6440> <t6441>There's no such person here; I haven't heard of anyone like that in my damn life.</t6441> <t6442>I don't think there's such a person here or anywhere else." I took out Smollet's letter, and the spelling lesson I received regarding the name of the square seemed like it might guide me.</t6442> <t6443>"What's your duty?" I asked.</t6443>
<t6444>“I am an assistant,” he said.</t6444> <t6445>I immediately realized I was on the right track; the way Smollet had written it had misled me once again.</t6445> <t6446>A half-crown tip made the assistant share what he knew, and I learned that Mr. Bloxam, who was recovering from the beers he drank the night he spent in Corcoran, had left for his job in Poplar at five o'clock this morning.</t6446> <t6447>He couldn't tell me where that place or job was, but he had a vague idea that it was one of those "newfangled warehouses," and with this weak clue, I had to set off for Poplar.</t6447> <t6448>It was twelve o'clock by the time I found a satisfactory indication of such a building, and I found it in a restaurant where some workers were having their lunch.</t6448> <t6449>One of these men suggested that a new "cold storage warehouse" was being built on Cross Angel Street; and since this fit the description of a "newfangled warehouse," I immediately went there by carriage.</t6449> <t6450>A tense conversation with a grim-faced guard and an even grimmer-faced foreman, whose cooperation I secured by offering to pay his daily wage, led me to Bloxam; the man was summoned after I indicated I was willing to pay the foreman to allow me to ask a few personal questions.</t6450> <t6451>Despite his rough speech and demeanor, he was a fairly intelligent man.</t6451> <t6452>When I told him I would pay for the information and gave him an advance, he said he had made two trips between a house in Carfax and one in Piccadilly, transporting nine large crates - "really heavy things" - from the first house to the second with a horse and cart he had hired for this purpose.</t6452> <t6453>When I asked him to tell me the number of the house in Piccadilly, he responded:</t6453>
<t6454>“Well, boss, I forget the numbers, but it was only a few buildings past a big white church or something like that.</t6454> <t6455>It was also an old, dusty house, though not as dusty as the damn house where we picked up the crates.”</t6455> <t6456>“If both were vacant at the time, how did you get into the houses?” “There was an old man waiting for me at the house in Purfleet.</t6456> <t6457>He helped me lift the crates and load them into the car.</t6457> <t6458>By God, even though he was a thin old man with a white mustache, he was the strongest man I've ever met.</t6458><t6459>”</t6459>
<t6460>How these words frightened me.</t6460>
<t6461>“The man lifted one end of the chests as if he were carrying tea, but I had already started huffing and puffing before I could lift the end I was holding - and I'm no weakling either.</t6461><t6462>”</t6462>
<t6463>“How did you get into the house on Piccadilly?” I asked.</t6463> <t6464>“The same man was there too.</t6464> <t6465>He must have set out before me and arrived there, because when I rang the bell, he came and opened the door and helped me carry the crates into the hall.”</t6465> <t6466>“All nine of them?” I asked.</t6466>
<t6467>“Yes; there were five in the first load, and four in the second load.</t6467> <t6468>It was quite a thirst-inducing job, and I don't really remember how I got home.”</t6468> <t6469>I interrupted:</t6469>
<t6470>“Were the boxes left in the hallway?</t6470><t6471>”</t6471>
<t6472>"Yes; it was a large hold and there was nothing but crates."</t6472> <t6473>I made another attempt to gain more information:</t6473>
<t6474>"Didn't you have the key?"</t6474><t6475>"</t6475>
<t6476>“I never used a key or anything like that.</t6476> <t6477>The old man opened the door and he closed it as he drove away.</t6477> <t6478>I don't remember the last trip - because of the beer.</t6478><t6479>”</t6479>
<t6480>“And you can't remember the house number, can you?”</t6480> <t6481>“No, sir.</t6481> <t6482>But you won't have any trouble finding it.</t6482> <t6483>It's a tall building with an arched entrance and high steps leading to the door.</t6483> <t6484>I know those steps because I carried crates up them with three idlers who came to earn a few pence.</t6484> <t6485>The old man gave them each a shilling, and when they saw how much they got, they wanted more; but the man grabbed one of them by the shoulder and almost threw him down the stairs until they cursed and ran away.”</t6485> <t6486>I thought I could find the house with this description, so I paid my friend for the information and set off for Piccadilly.</t6486> <t6487>I had learned a new, painful fact: Apparently, the Count could carry the earth boxes by himself.</t6487> <t6488>If so, time was very precious, because now that he had ensured a certain number of distributions, he could complete the task unnoticed by choosing his own timing.</t6488> <t6489>I got out of the cab at Piccadilly Circus and walked west; behind the Junior Constitutional, I came across the described house and was convinced that this was the next refuge arranged by Dracula.</t6489> <t6490>The house looked like it hadn't been lived in for a long time.</t6490> <t6491>The windows were covered in dust, and the shutters were open.</t6491> <t6492>All the frames had darkened over time, and most of the paint on the iron had peeled off.</t6492> <t6493>It was clear that there had been a large signboard in front of the balcony until recently, but it had been roughly removed, with the posts that held it still standing there.</t6493> <t6494>Behind the balcony railings, I saw some loose boards with unpolished white edges.</t6494> <t6495>I would have given a lot to see the signboard in its entirety, as it would probably have given some clues about the owner of the house.</t6495> <t6496>I recalled my experiences with the investigation and sale of Carfax and couldn't help but think that if I could find the previous owner, there might be a way to enter the house.</t6496>
<t6497>At the moment, there was nothing more to learn or do on the Piccadilly side; therefore, I wandered to the back of the house to see if anything could be obtained from this area.</t6497> <t6498>Since most of the houses on Piccadilly were occupied, the stables were busy.</t6498> <t6499>I asked a couple of grooms and servants I saw if they could tell me anything about the empty house.</t6499> <t6500>One of them said he had heard that the house had been purchased recently, but he couldn't say from whom.</t6500> <t6501>But until recently, there had been a signboard saying "For Sale," and he suggested that the real estate agents Mitchell, Sons & Candy might be able to tell me something, as he thought he remembered seeing their name on the board.</t6501> <t6502>Not wanting to appear too eager or have my source guess too much, I thanked him in my usual manner and left.</t6502> <t6503>It was now beginning to get dark, and the autumn evening was setting in, so I wasted no time.</t6503> <t6504>Shortly after learning the address of Mitchell, Sons & Candy from an address book in Berkeley, I reached their offices on Sackville Street.</t6504>
<t6505>The gentleman who welcomed me was particularly polite, but equally tight-lipped.</t6505> <t6506>When he told me that the Piccadilly house - during our conversation he referred to this building as the "mansion" - had been sold, he thought our business was concluded.</t6506> <t6507>When I asked him who had bought it, he widened his eyes and paused for a few seconds before answering: "The house has been sold, sir.</t6507><t6508>"</t6508>
<t6509>“Excuse me,” I said with the same politeness, “but I have a special reason for wanting to know who bought it.”</t6509> <t6510>He paused a little longer and raised his eyebrows even higher.</t6510> <t6511>His short and concise response was again, “The house is sold, sir.”</t6511>
<t6512>“Of course,” I said, “you wouldn't mind letting me know this much.</t6512><t6513>”</t6513>
<t6514>"But I see an objection," he replied.</t6514> <t6515>"The affairs of our clients are in absolute safety in the hands of Mitchell, Sons & Candy."</t6515> <t6516>This was clearly first-degree formalism, and there was no point in arguing with him.</t6516> <t6517>I thought it would be best to speak to him by following his method, so I said:</t6517>
<t6518>“Your clients should be happy to have a protector who guards their secrets with such determination.</t6518> <t6519>I am also a professional.”</t6519> <t6520>Here, I handed him my card.</t6520> <t6521>“In this case, I am not seeking information out of curiosity; I am acting on behalf of Lord Godalming, who wishes to obtain information regarding a property he understood to be for sale until recently.”</t6521> <t6522>These words brought a completely different color to the matters.</t6522> <t6523>He responded as follows:</t6523>
<t6524>“If there is anything I can do, I would like to assist you and especially Lordship, Mr. Harker.</t6524> <t6525>When he was the Honorable Arthur Holmwood, we once handled a small matter of renting some rooms for him.</t6525> <t6526>If you allow me to have Lordship's address, I will consult the Company on this matter and contact Lordship by tonight's post in any case.</t6526> <t6527>If we can deviate from our rules regarding the information Lordship desires, it would be our pleasure.</t6527><t6528>”</t6528>
<t6529>I thanked him because I wanted to make a friend, not an enemy, and gave Dr. Seward's address before leaving.</t6529> <t6530>It was already dark, and I was tired and hungry.</t6530> <t6531>I had a cup of tea at the Aerated Bread Company and took the next train to Purfleet.</t6531>
<t6532>When I returned, I found everyone at home.</t6532> <t6533>Mina looked tired and pale, but she was making a brave effort to appear lively and cheerful; the thought that I had to hide something from her and thus caused her unease wrenched my heart.</t6533> <t6534>Thank God, this will be the last night she will have to witness our meetings and feel the pain of our lack of trust in her.</t6534> <t6535>I had mustered all my courage to maintain our wise decision to keep her out of our relentless task.</t6535> <t6536>Somehow, she now seems more at peace or perhaps the subject itself has become repulsive to her, because whenever it is accidentally mentioned, she genuinely shudders.</t6536> <t6537>I am glad we made our decision in time because the increasing knowledge coupled with such a feeling would have been torture for her.</t6537>
<t6538>I couldn't tell the others what I had learned that day until I was alone, so after dinner - and after dinner, we listened to some music among ourselves to keep up appearances - I took Mina to her room and left her there to sleep.</t6538> <t6539>Dear girl was more affectionate towards me than ever and hugged me tightly as if she wanted to keep me there, but there was much to talk about and I left.</t6539> <t6540>Thank God, stopping the recounting of events didn't change anything between us.</t6540>
<t6541>When I went back downstairs, I found the others gathered around the fire in the study.</t6541> <t6542>On the train, I had written in my journal about the events up to that point, and I simply read it aloud as the best way to share the information I had gathered with them; when I finished, Van Helsing said:</t6542>
<t6543>“It has been a terrific day, my friend John.</t6543> <t6544>Undoubtedly, we are on the trail of the lost chests.</t6544> <t6545>If we find all of them in that house, then it means our work is about to end.</t6545> <t6546>But if there are any missing chests, we must continue searching until we find them.</t6546> <t6547>Then, we will deliver our final blow and hunt down this scoundrel to his true death.</t6547> <t6548>For a while, we all sat in silence; suddenly, Mr. Morris spoke:</t6548>
<t6549>“Tell me! How are we going to get into that house?”</t6549><t6550>”</t6550>
<t6551>"We entered the other one, didn't we," replied Lord Godalming quickly.</t6551>
<t6552>“But Art, this is different.</t6552> <t6553>We forced our way into Carfax, but we had our greenery surrounded by night and walls protecting us.</t6553> <t6554>Entering the house in Piccadilly, whether by night or day, will be a very different thing, almost like committing a burglary.</t6554> <t6555>I must admit, I don’t understand how we’ll get in if that worthless realtor can’t find us a key, but perhaps we’ll learn when we receive his letter in the morning.” Lord Godalming frowned and began pacing the room.</t6555> <t6556>Soon he stopped and, turning to each of us in turn, said:</t6556>
<t6557>"Quincey is very sensible.</t6557> <t6558>This matter of breaking into the house like a thief has started to get serious; we got away with it once, but now we have a rare task at hand - if we can't find the Count's key basket.</t6558><t6559>"</t6559>
<t6560>Since nothing could be done until morning and it would be reasonable to wait until Lord Godalming hears from the Mitchells, we decided not to take any action before breakfast.</t6560><t6561>We sat for a long time, smoking and discussing the matter from various angles; I also took the opportunity to bring my journal up to date.</t6561><t6562>I am very sleepy, I will go to bed.</t6562><t6563>One more line.</t6563><t6564>Mina is sleeping soundly and her breathing is regular.</t6564><t6565>There are small wrinkles on her forehead as if she is lost in thought even in her sleep.</t6565><t6566>Her color is still very pale, but she doesn't look as exhausted as she did this morning.</t6566><t6567>I hope tomorrow will set everything right; she will recover at home in Exeter.</t6567><t6568>Oh, but I am very sleepy!</t6568>
<t6569>Dr. Seward's journal</t6569>
<t6570>October 1st.</t6570> <t6571>- Renfield surprised me once again.</t6571> <t6572>His mood changes so quickly that I find it difficult to keep up, and each time they signify more than just his own well-being, making them a subject of study that is more than merely interesting.</t6572> <t6573>This morning, after he turned Van Helsing away, when I went to see him, his demeanor was like that of a man who commands fate.</t6573> <t6574>In fact, he was commanding fate - subjectively.</t6574> <t6575>He was not interested in anything related to mere health; he was pensive and scornful of the needs of us poor mortals with our weaknesses.</t6575> <t6576>I thought I might learn something by seizing the opportunity, and so I asked him:</t6576>
<t6577>"What's the news about the flies these days?"</t6577> <t6578>He smiled in a condescending manner as he answered me - a smile that could belong to Malvolio.</t6578>
<t6579>"Dear sir, the fly has one striking feature: its wings possess the qualities of spiritual abilities related to air.</t6579> <t6580>Ancient civilizations were right in designating the butterfly as a symbol of the soul.</t6580><t6581>"</t6581>
<t6582>Since I wanted to push the logic of his analogy to its limits, I quickly said:</t6582>
<t6583>“Ah, so now you're after the soul, are you?”</t6583> <t6584>His madness was obstructing his reason, and with a determination I rarely saw in him, he shook his head from side to side as a look of astonishment spread across his face; he said:</t6584>
<t6585>“Ah, no! Ah, no! I don't want a soul.</t6585> <t6586>The only thing I want is life.”</t6586> <t6587>He came to life here: “Right now, I am quite indifferent to it.</t6587> <t6588>Life is not bad; I have everything I want.</t6588> <t6589>If you wish to study Zoophagous, you must find a new patient, Doctor!” This surprised me a bit, so I pressed on:</t6589>
<t6590>“So then, you rule over life; you are God then, I suppose, is that right?”</t6590> <t6591>He smiled with a greatness of indescribable kindness.</t6591>
<t6592>“Ah, no! Adopting the attributes of the gods is far from me.</t6592> <t6593>I am not even interested in His especially spiritual works.</t6593> <t6594>If I may be permitted to state my intellectual position, to some extent I am in the position of Enoch, who was entirely worldly but spiritually captured!”</t6594> <t6595>This was a difficult situation for me.</t6595> <t6596>At that moment, I could not recall the significance of Enoch; therefore, knowing that by doing so I was belittling myself in the eyes of a madman, I had to ask him an easy question:</t6596>
<t6597>“So why Hanok?</t6597><t6598>”</t6598>
<t6599>“Because he was walking with God.”</t6599> <t6600>I couldn't see the similarity, but I didn't want to accept it; so I returned to what he had previously rejected:</t6600>
<t6601>“So you’re not interested in life and you don’t want any soul.</t6601> <t6602>Why?” I quickly and somewhat harshly asked my question to disturb his peace.</t6602> <t6603>My effort was successful; for a moment, that unproud demeanor unconsciously returned, he bowed before me and, in fact, while answering, he fawned over me: “I don’t want any soul, really, really! I don’t want it.</t6603> <t6604>If I had them, I couldn’t use them; I can’t use them in any way.</t6604> <t6605>I can’t eat them or...”</t6605> <t6606>Suddenly he fell silent and the old cunning expression settled on his face like the wind flowing over the surface of the water.</t6606> <t6607>“And Doctor, when it comes to life, what is life after all?</t6607> <t6608>When you have everything you need and you know you’ll never feel the lack of anything again, that means everything.</t6608> <t6609>With friends like you -good friends- Dr. Seward,” -these words were spoken with an indescribably cunning look- “I know I will never be deprived of the riches of life.</t6609><t6610>”</t6610>
<t6611>In the incomprehensibility of his madness, I think he saw a kind of hostility in me, because he immediately retreated to his last refuge - stubborn silence.</t6611> <t6612>Soon after, I realized that for now, there would be no benefit in talking to him.</t6612> <t6613>He had sulked, and so, I left.</t6613>
<t6614>He summoned me later in the day.</t6614> <t6615>Generally, I wouldn't come without a special reason, but right now it interests me so much that I would gladly make the effort.</t6615> <t6616>Also, I am glad to have something to help me pass the time.</t6616> <t6617>Harker is outside, following the clues, as are Lord Godalming and Quincey.</t6617> <t6618>Van Helsing is in my study, examining the record prepared by the Harkers; he seems to think he might find a clue with accurate information on all the details.</t6618> <t6619>He does not want to be disturbed without reason while working.</t6619> <t6620>I could have asked him to come with me to see the patient, but I thought he might not be interested in going again after his last refusal.</t6620> <t6621>There was another reason: Renfield might not speak as freely in the presence of a third person as he does when it's just the two of us.</t6621>
<t6622>I found him sitting on his stool in the middle of the room, usually an indication of a kind of mental activity peculiar to him.</t6622> <t6623>When I entered, he immediately said as if the question had been waiting on the tip of his lips:</t6623>
<t6624>“What happened to the spirits?” It was clear that my guess was correct.</t6624> <t6625>Unconscious thinking was performing its duty even in a mentally ill person.</t6625> <t6626>“You tell me, what happened to the spirits?” I asked.</t6626> <t6627>For a moment, he didn't answer, but he looked to his right, left, down, and up as if he were waiting for inspiration to respond.</t6627>
<t6628>“I don't want a soul!” he said in a feeble, apologetic manner.</t6628> <t6629>The matter seemed to be gnawing at his mind, and for this reason, I decided to use it - to “be cruel to be kind.”</t6629> <t6630>So I said:</t6630>
<t6631>“Do you love life and want to live?</t6631><t6632>”</t6632>
<t6633>“Ah, yes! But there's no problem with that; you don't need to worry about it.</t6633><t6634>”</t6634>
<t6635>“But,” I asked, “how will we take life without taking the soul as well?”</t6635> <t6636>This seemed to confuse him, so I didn't let it go:</t6636>
<t6637>“One day, you will have a good time flying there with the souls of thousands of flies and spiders and birds and cats buzzing, chirping, and meowing around you.</t6637> <t6638>You possess their lives, you know, and you must also endure their souls!”</t6638> <t6639>Something seemed to have affected his imagination, for he brought his fingers to his ears and shut his eyes tightly, like a little boy whose face was being soaped.</t6639> <t6640>There was something pitiful in this that touched me; it also taught me a lesson; for he seemed to be a child before me - though his features were worn and his beard was white, he appeared to be just a child.</t6640> <t6641>It was clear that he was going through some kind of mental disorder, and knowing how he interpreted things that seemed foreign to him in his past states of mind, I thought of getting into his mind and progressing with him as much as I could.</t6641> <t6642>The first step was to regain his trust, so I asked quite loudly, so that he could hear me despite his blocked ears:</t6642>
<t6643>"Do you want some sugar to have flies around you again?" He seemed to have woken up immediately and shook his head from side to side.</t6643> <t6644>He replied with a laugh:</t6644>
<t6645>"I don't really want to!"</t6645> <t6646>"After all, flies are poor creatures!" After pausing for a bit, he added.</t6646> <t6647>"However, I don't want their souls buzzing around me.</t6647><t6648>"</t6648>
<t6649>“Or spiders,” I continued.</t6649>
<t6650>“Flying spiders?</t6650> <t6651>What good are spiders anyway?</t6651> <t6652>They can't be eaten or...”</t6652> <t6653>He suddenly stopped as if reminded of a forbidden topic.</t6653>
<t6654>"So that's how it is!" I thought to myself, "This is the second stance on the word 'drink' all of a sudden; what does this mean?" Renfield seemed to be aware of his mistake, because he hurriedly continued his words as if he wanted to divert my attention from it:</t6654>
<t6655>“I don't bother with such things.</t6655> <t6656>As Shakespeare said, 'Mice and rats and little deer'; they could also be called 'chicken feed in the barn'.</t6656> <t6657>All this nonsense is beyond me now.</t6657> <t6658>When you know what's in front of you, you can ask a man to eat molecules with sticks until he tries to interest you in lower carnivores.” “I understand,” I said.</t6658> <t6659>“You want big things to sink your teeth into, right?</t6659> <t6660>How about having an elephant for breakfast?” “How ridiculous you are!” He was becoming more alert, so I thought I could push him further.</t6660> <t6661>Reflecting him, I said, “The soul of an elephant, I wonder what it's like!” The effect I desired had occurred, because he immediately calmed down and became childlike again.</t6661>
<t6662>“I don't want the soul of an elephant; I don't want any soul!” he said.</t6662> <t6663>He sat in despair for a few seconds.</t6663> <t6664>Suddenly, his eyes lit up and he jumped to his feet with a sign of intense mental excitement.</t6664> <t6665>“To hell with you and your souls!” he shouted.</t6665> <t6666>“Stop nagging me with souls.</t6666> <t6667>Don't I already have enough worries, enough to cause me pain and confusion, other than thinking about souls!”</t6667> <t6668>He looked so aggressive that I thought he was having another murderous fit, so I blew my whistle.</t6668> <t6669>But, as soon as I did that, he calmed down and apologized, saying:</t6669>
<t6670>“Forgive me, Doctor; I lost myself.</t6670> <t6671>You don't need any help.</t6671> <t6672>I am so anxious that I have a tendency to get angry quickly.</t6672> <t6673>If you knew the problem I have to face and try to solve, you would pity me, understand me, and forgive me.</t6673> <t6674>I beg you, don't put me in a straitjacket.</t6674> <t6675>I want to think, and I can't think clearly when my body is restrained.</t6675> <t6676>I'm sure you will understand!” Clearly, he could control himself; therefore, when the nurses arrived, I told them not to mind and they withdrew.</t6676> <t6677>Renfield watched them leave; when the door closed, he said with great dignity and sweetness:</t6677>
<t6678>"Dr. Seward, you have been very understanding towards me.</t6678> <t6679>Believe me, I am very, very grateful to you!" I thought it was good to leave him in this state of mind and thus left the room.</t6679> <t6680>Undoubtedly, there was something in this man's condition that needed to be pondered over.</t6680> <t6681>If one could sequence it correctly, there seemed to be many points that would form what American reporters call a "story," here they are:</t6681>
<t6682>He is not talking about "drinking."</t6682>
<t6683>He is afraid of bearing the burden of the "soul" of anything.</t6683>
<t6684>He has no reservations about a lack of "life" in the future.</t6684>
<t6685>Despite being afraid of pursuing their souls, they completely disdain lower forms of life.</t6685>
<t6686>Logically, all of this points to one thing!</t6686> <t6687>In some way, he has the assurance of a higher life.</t6687> <t6688>He is afraid of the outcome - the burden of the soul.</t6688> <t6689>Then, what he relies on is human life!</t6689>
<t6690>But what about assurance?</t6690>
<t6691>Forgiving God! The Count has gone to him, and a new cabinet of horrors is being turned!</t6691>
<t6692>Later.</t6692> <t6693>- After completing my rounds, I went to Van Helsing and told him my suspicion.</t6693> <t6694>He became very serious and, after thinking about the matter for a while, asked me to take him to Renfield.</t6694> <t6695>I did so.</t6695> <t6696>When we reached the door, we heard the madman singing cheerfully, as he used to do in times that now seemed long past.</t6696> <t6697>When we entered, we saw in astonishment that he was scattering his sugar as before; the flies, sluggish with autumn, had started buzzing around the room.</t6697> <t6698>We tried to get him to talk about the subject of our previous conversation, but he wouldn't engage with us.</t6698> <t6699>He continued singing as if we weren't there.</t6699> <t6700>He had found a piece of paper and was folding it to make a notebook.</t6700> <t6701>We left as ignorant as we had entered.</t6701>
<t6702>Indeed, it was an unprecedented case; we must keep him under observation tonight.</t6702>

<t6704>Letter to Lord Godalming</t6704>
<t6705>October 1</t6705>
<t6706>My lord,</t6706>
<t6707>We always take great pleasure in fulfilling your wishes.</t6707> <t6708>Based on the desires expressed on your behalf by Mr. Harker, I am pleased to provide the following information regarding the purchase and sale of 347 Piccadilly.</t6708> <t6709>The initial sellers are the trustees of the late Mr. Archibald Winter-Suffield.</t6709> <t6710>The buyer, who carried out the purchase himself and, if your Lordship would pardon me for using such a crude term, paid the sale price in cash "over the counter," is a foreign nobleman named Count de Ville.</t6710> <t6711>Beyond this, we have no information about him.</t6711>
<t6712>You are the respectful servants of our Lord</t6712>
<t6713>MITCHELL, SONS & CANDY</t6713>
<t6714>Dr. Seward's journal</t6714>
<t6715>October 2.</t6715> <t6716>- Last night, I stationed a man in the corridor and instructed him to meticulously note every sound coming from Renfield’s room and to call me if anything unusual occurred.</t6716> <t6717>After dinner, when we all gathered around the fire in the study -after Ms. Harker had gone to bed- we discussed the day’s endeavors and findings.</t6717> <t6718>Harker was the only one who had made any progress, and we have high hopes that the clue he found might be significant.</t6718>
<t6719>Before going to bed, I went to the patient's room and looked through the peephole.</t6719> <t6720>He was sleeping soundly, and his chest was rising and falling with his regular breathing.</t6720>
<t6721>This morning, the attendant told me that he felt uneasy shortly after midnight and recited his prayers a bit louder.</t6721> <t6722>I asked him if that was all; he replied saying that was all he heard.</t6722> <t6723>There was something so suspicious in his manner that I directly asked him if he had slept.</t6723> <t6724>He denied sleeping, but admitted to having "dozed off" for a while.</t6724> <t6725>It's very unfortunate that people cannot be trusted unless they are being watched.</t6725>
<t6726>Today, Harker is out following the lead, and Art and Quincey are looking after the horses.</t6726> <t6727>Godalming thinks it would be good to have horses always ready because once we obtain the information we are looking for, we will have no time to lose.</t6727> <t6728>We must purify all the soil brought from outside between sunrise and sunset; thus, we will catch the Count at his weakest, without a refuge to escape to quickly.</t6728> <t6729>Van Helsing went to the British Museum to find someone who is an expert in ancient remedies.</t6729> <t6730>Ancient physicians would consider things that physicians of the subsequent generations did not accept, and the Professor is looking for witch and demon treatment methods that might be useful to us later.</t6730>
<t6731>From time to time, I think that we all need to be crazy and that we will realize our sanity within straitjackets.</t6731>
<t6732>Later on.</t6732> <t6733>- We have come together again.</t6733> <t6734>At least, it seems like we are on the trail, and tomorrow's work could be the beginning of the end.</t6734> <t6735>I wonder if Renfield's calmness has anything to do with this.</t6735> <t6736>His moods matched the Count's actions so well that he might somehow be aware of the monster's impending destruction.</t6736> <t6737>If we could get an idea of what went through his mind in the time between our discussion today and his resumption of catching flies, it might have given us a valuable clue.</t6737> <t6738>Now he seems to be calm as if under a spell...</t6738> <t6739>Is that so?</t6739> <t6740>- That wild scream seems to be coming from his room...</t6740>
<t6741>The nurse burst into my room and said that Renfield had had some sort of accident.</t6741> <t6742>He had heard his screams, and when he went to him, he was lying face down on the floor, and there was blood everywhere.</t6742> <t6743>I must go immediately...</t6743>
<t6744>XXI</t6744>
<t6745>Dr. Seward's journal</t6745>
<t6746>October 3.</t6746> <t6747>- Let me record everything that has happened since my last entry here, as completely as I can remember.</t6747> <t6748>Not a single detail that I can recall should be forgotten; I must begin with all my composure.</t6748>
<t6749>When I came to Renfield's room, I found him lying on the floor in a pool of blood shining on his left side.</t6749> <t6750>When I went to move him, the fact that he had sustained horrific injuries immediately became apparent; there was nothing among the limbs of the body that indicated any unity of purpose, even if sluggishly.</t6750> <t6751>When his face came into view, I saw that it was horrifically battered as if it had been smashed against the ground - indeed, the pool of blood on the floor was coming from the wounds on his face.</t6751> <t6752>The nurse, who was kneeling beside the body, said as he turned Renfield over: "I think his back is broken, sir.</t6752> <t6753>Look, his right arm and leg, and that entire side of his face are paralyzed!" Such a thing had greatly surprised the nurse.</t6753> <t6754>He seemed bewildered and his brows were furrowed as he continued speaking:</t6754>
<t6755>“There are two things I can’t understand.</t6755> <t6756>He could have injured his face like this by hitting his head on the ground.</t6756> <t6757>Once, at Eversfield Asylum, I saw a young woman do this before anyone could even touch her.</t6757> <t6758>And he might have broken his back if his body was twisted in a strange way while falling out of bed.</t6758> <t6759>But I swear, I can’t imagine how both happened at the same time.</t6759> <t6760>If his back was broken, he couldn’t have hit his head, and if his face was like this before he fell out of bed, there would be marks of it.”</t6760> <t6761>I said: “Go to Dr. Van Helsing and kindly ask him to come here immediately.</t6761> <t6762>I want him without a moment’s delay.”</t6762> <t6763>The man ran out and within a few minutes, the Professor appeared in his dressing gown and slippers.</t6763> <t6764>When he saw Renfield on the floor, he looked at him sharply for a moment and then turned to me.</t6764> <t6765>I think he saw what I was thinking in my eyes, because he said quietly, clearly addressing the nurse’s ears: “Ah, a sad accident!</t6765> <t6766>He needs to be kept under great supervision and taken care of very well.</t6766> <t6767>I will stay with you, but first I need to get dressed.</t6767> <t6768>If you wait, I will join you in a few minutes.</t6768><t6769>”</t6769>
<t6770>The patient was now breathing with a wheeze, and it was easy to see that he was suffering terribly from his injuries.</t6770> <t6771>Van Helsing returned with his surgical bag at an extraordinary speed.</t6771> <t6772>It was clear that he had thought and made a decision, because almost before looking at the patient, he whispered to me:</t6772>
<t6773>"Send the nurse away from here."</t6773> <t6774>"We need to be alone with him when he wakes up after the surgery."</t6774> <t6775>Therefore, I said:</t6775>
<t6776>“I think that's enough for now, Simmons.</t6776> <t6777>We've done everything we can for the moment.</t6777> <t6778>You'd better return to your rounds, Dr. Van Helsing will perform the surgery.</t6778> <t6779>If anything unusual happens anywhere, let me know immediately.”</t6779> <t6780>The man stepped aside and we carefully began to examine the patient.</t6780> <t6781>The wounds on his face were superficial; the main injury was a fracture extending directly to the motor area of the skull.</t6781> <t6782>The professor thought for a moment and said:</t6782>
<t6783>“We must reduce the pressure and return to normal conditions as much as possible; the speed of the burn shows the terrible nature of the wound.</t6783> <t6784>The entire motor region seems to be affected.</t6784> <t6785>The bleeding in the brain will increase rapidly, so we must drill the skull immediately or it might be too late.”</t6785> <t6786>As he was speaking, there was a slow knock on the door.</t6786> <t6787>I went and opened it, finding Arthur and Quincey in their pajamas and slippers in the hallway outside.</t6787> <t6788>Arthur spoke:</t6788>
<t6789>“I heard that your man called Dr. Van Helsing and told him about an accident.</t6789> <t6790>Therefore, I woke Quincey up, or rather, I called him since he hadn't slept yet.</t6790> <t6791>Events are progressing too quickly and too strangely to allow any of us to sleep soundly at such times.</t6791> <t6792>I think everything will be different from before tomorrow night.</t6792> <t6793>We will need to look at the past - and the future - more than we have so far.</t6793> <t6794>Can we come in?”</t6794> <t6795>I nodded my head "yes" and kept the door open until they entered; then I closed it again.</t6795> <t6796>When Quincey saw the patient's position and condition and the horrifying pool on the floor, he softly said:</t6796>
<t6797>“My God! What happened to him?”</t6797> <t6798>“Poor, poor devil!”</t6798> <t6799>I briefly explained to him what had happened and added that we were waiting for him to regain consciousness after the surgery - at least for a short while.</t6799> <t6800>He immediately went and sat by the bedside, with Godalming next to him; we all watched patiently.</t6800>
<t6801>“For the incision procedure,” said Van Helsing, “we will wait until we determine the most suitable point; thus, we will be able to remove the blood clot from there in the fastest and most accurate way because it is clear that the bleeding has increased.</t6801><t6802>”</t6802>
<t6803>The minutes we waited passed with a dreadful slowness.</t6803> <t6804>There was a terrible sinking feeling in my heart, and from Van Helsing's face, I concluded that he too felt fear or anxiety about what was to come.</t6804> <t6805>I was afraid of the words Renfield might say.</t6805> <t6806>I was definitely afraid to think, but from what I had read about those who sense the death throes, I had an idea of what was going to happen.</t6806> <t6807>The poor man's breath was barely perceptible.</t6807>
<t6808>She seemed as if she could open her eyes and speak at any moment, but then this was followed by long, rattling breaths, and then she would lapse into an even more stagnant stupor.</t6808> <t6809>Despite being accustomed to sickbeds and death, this doubt grew and grew within me.</t6809> <t6810>I could almost hear my own heartbeat, and the sound of blood rushing to my temples felt like hammer blows.</t6810> <t6811>The silence eventually turned into torture.</t6811> <t6812>I looked at my friends one by one and realized from their flushed faces and wet foreheads that they were enduring the same torture.</t6812> <t6813>Over all of us, there was a disturbing doubt, as if a terrible bell would ring above our heads at the most unexpected moment.</t6813>
<t6814>The moment finally came that indicated the patient's rapid decline; he could die at any moment.</t6814> <t6815>I looked at the professor and saw that his eyes were fixed on mine.</t6815> <t6816>His face was stern as he spoke:</t6816>
<t6817>“There is no time to lose.</t6817> <t6818>His words could touch many lives; I was thinking about this while standing here.</t6818> <t6819>A soul might be in danger!</t6819> <t6820>We will operate just above the ear.</t6820><t6821>”</t6821>
<t6822>Without saying another word, he performed the surgery.</t6822> <t6823>For a few minutes, his breathing continued to be wheezy.</t6823> <t6824>Then the patient took such a deep breath that it seemed as if he was going to swallow his chest.</t6824> <t6825>Suddenly, his eyes opened and fixed with a wild, desperate look.</t6825> <t6826>This lasted for a few minutes; then his gaze softened into a satisfied smile, and a sigh of relief escaped his lips.</t6826> <t6827>He was moving restlessly and while doing so, he said:</t6827>
<t6828>“I will be quiet, Doctor.</t6828> <t6829>Tell them to take off the straitjacket.</t6829> <t6830>I had a terrible dream and it weakened me so much that I can't move.</t6830> <t6831>What happened to my face?</t6831> <t6832>I feel very swollen and it hurts a lot.”</t6832> <t6833>He tried to turn his head; but even attempting this made his eyes glaze over again, so I gently put him back in his original position.</t6833> <t6834>Then, Van Helsing said in a low, dignified tone:</t6834>
<t6835>“Tell us about your dream, Mr. Renfield.” When he heard the voice, despite his infirmity, the patient's face lit up and he said:</t6835>
<t6836>“This is Dr. Van Helsing.</t6836> <t6837>How good it is that you are here.</t6837> <t6838>Give me some water, my lips are dry; I will try to tell you.</t6838> <t6839>In my dream...” He paused and seemed to faint, I quietly called to Quincey: “Brandy, in my study, quick!” He flew out and returned with a glass, a bottle of brandy, and a bottle of water.</t6839> <t6840>We moistened his parched lips and the patient quickly revived.</t6840> <t6841>But the poor, wounded brain seemed to have continued working intermittently, because when he came to quite a bit, he looked at me with piercing eyes filled with a pain I will never forget and continued:</t6841>
<t6842>“I must not deceive myself; it was not a dream, it was all a terrible reality.”</t6842> <t6843>Then, his eyes wandered around the room; seeing the two people patiently sitting by the edge of the bed, he continued his words:</t6843>
<t6844>"If I hadn't already been sure, I would have understood from them."</t6844> <t6845>For a moment, his eyes closed—not from pain or sleep, but as if he was gathering all his faculties to endure; when he opened his eyes, he said with urgency and an energy he had never shown before:</t6845>
<t6846>“Quick, Doctor, quick.</t6846> <t6847>I'm dying!</t6847> <t6848>I feel I have only a few minutes left, and then I will go to death—or something worse!</t6848> <t6849>Wet my lips with brandy again.</t6849> <t6850>There is something I must say before I die, or before my poor crushed brain dies.</t6850> <t6851>Thank you! It happened the night I begged you to let me go, after you left my side.</t6851> <t6852>I couldn't speak then, because my tongue felt tied; but I was as sane then as I am now.</t6852> <t6853>After you left, I suffered the agony of despair for a long time; it felt like hours had passed.</t6853> <t6854>Then, suddenly, a calmness came over me.</t6854> <t6855>My mind seemed to regain its composure, and I realized where I was.</t6855> <t6856>I heard the dogs barking from the back of our house, but I didn't know where He was!” As Renfield spoke, Van Helsing's eyes never blinked, but his hand reached out, met mine, and gripped it firmly.</t6856> <t6857>But he didn't give himself away; he nodded slightly and said in a low voice, "Go on."</t6857> <t6858>Renfield continued:</t6858>
<t6859>"As I had often seen him before, he came to the window in the mist, but this time, he was solid - not a ghost, and his eyes were fiery like those of an angry man.</t6859> <t6860>He was laughing with his red mouth; when he turned to look over the trees to where the dogs were barking, his sharp white teeth gleamed in the moonlight.</t6860> <t6861>Although I knew that this was what he wanted - as he had always wanted - I did not immediately invite him in.</t6861> <t6862>Then he began to make promises to me again - not with words but by doing them.”</t6862> <t6863>He was interrupted by a word from the Professor:</t6863>
<t6864>"How?</t6864><t6865>"</t6865>
<t6866>"By making them happen; just like sending flies inside while the sun is shining.</t6866> <t6867>Big fat flies with wings of steel and sapphire, and at night, big moths with skull and crossbones patterns on their backs." While Van Helsing nodded at him, he unconsciously said to me:</t6867>
<t6868>“Acherontia atropos - the thing you call the ‘death's-head hawkmoth’!” The patient continued to speak incessantly:</t6868>
<t6869>“Then he began to whisper: ‘Rats, rats, rats!</t6869> <t6870>Hundreds, thousands, millions of them; and all of them a life; and dogs will eat them; and cats too.</t6870> <t6871>All life! All of them, red blood hiding years of life inside, and not just buzzing flies!</t6871><t6872>’ I laughed at him because I wanted to see what he could do.</t6872> <t6873>Then, from beyond the dark trees of His house, dogs barked.</t6873> <t6874>He called me to the window with a nod.</t6874> <t6875>I stood up and looked outside, and He raised his hands and seemed to call without speaking.</t6875> <t6876>Over the grass, a dark mass spread like the flame of a fire; then He moved the mist to the right and left, and I could see thousands of rats with red eyes glowing red like His, but smaller than His.</t6876> <t6877>He raised his hand and they all stopped; it seemed as if He was saying: ‘If you kneel before me and worship me, I will give you all these lives, yes, more and more, for countless centuries!’ And then, a cloud as red as blood closed over me; before I knew what I was doing, I found myself opening the window and saying to Him, ‘Come in, my Lord and Master!’</t6877> <t6878>All the rats were gone, but He glided in even though the window was only open a few centimeters - just like how the moon had previously entered through a tiny crack and stood before me in all its size and splendor.</t6878><t6879>”</t6879>
<t6880>The voice weakened, so I moistened his lips with brandy again, he continued his words, but his mind seemed to have kept working throughout this period, because his story had progressed.</t6880> <t6881>I was about to direct him back to our topic when Van Helsing whispered to me: "Let him continue telling.</t6881> <t6882>Do not interrupt him; he cannot go back in his story and if he loses his train of thought once, he may never progress again."</t6882> <t6883>Renfield continued his words:</t6883>
<t6884>“I waited for news from him all day, but he didn't send me anything, not even a fly, and by the time the moon rose, I was quite angry with him.</t6884> <t6885>Despite being closed, when he slipped inside through the window without even tapping on the glass, I went mad with rage.</t6885> <t6886>He mocked me, and his red eyes and white face looked out from within the mist, and he continued this attitude as if he owned the entire place and I was a nobody.</t6886> <t6887>Even his scent wasn't the same when he passed by me.</t6887> <t6888>I couldn't hold him.</t6888> <t6889>Somehow, I thought Ms. Harker had entered the room.</t6889><t6890>”</t6890>
<t6891>The two men sitting on the bed stood up and approached, positioning themselves behind Renfield so he couldn't see them, but they were in a place where they could hear better.</t6891> <t6892>Both were silent, but the Professor shuddered and trembled, his face growing increasingly stern.</t6892> <t6893>Renfield, without noticing this, continued his words: "When Ms. Harker came to see me today, she was different; she was like tea after the teapot has been watered down."</t6893> <t6894>We all stirred at this, but said nothing; Renfield continued his speech:</t6894>
<t6895>“I didn't realize he was here until he started talking, he didn't look the same as before.</t6895> <t6896>I don't care about pale people, I like them when they have a lot of blood, and it seemed like all his blood was drained.</t6896> <t6897>I didn't think about it at the time, but after he left, I started to think, and knowing that He was taking ms Harker's life drove me crazy.”</t6897> <t6898>I could feel that the others were trembling like me, but we still remained silent.</t6898> <t6899>“That's why I was ready for Him when He came tonight.</t6899> <t6900>I saw the mist slipping in and grabbed it tightly.</t6900> <t6901>I've heard that madmen have supernatural strength, and knowing that I am mad - at least, from time to time - I decided to use my strength.</t6901> <t6902>Yes, and He felt it too, because He had to emerge from the mist to fight me.</t6902> <t6903>I held Him tightly and thought I would win; because I wouldn't let Him take ms Harker's life any longer; until I saw His eyes.</t6903> <t6904>His eyes burned inside me and my strength melted away like water.</t6904> <t6905>He escaped from my grip and when I tried to cling to Him, He lifted me up and threw me to the ground.</t6905> <t6906>There was a red cloud and a sound like thunder in front of me, and the mist seemed to be escaping under the door.”</t6906> <t6907>His voice was getting weaker and his breath more wheezing.</t6907> <t6908>Van Helsing instinctively stood up.</t6908>
<t6909>“Now we know the worst,” he said.</t6909> <t6910>“He is here, and we know his purpose.</t6910> <t6911>It may not be too late yet.</t6911> <t6912>Let's arm ourselves - just like we did last night, but let's not waste any time; we don't have a single second to spare.”</t6912> <t6913>We didn't need to put our fear and, moreover, our faith into words - we all shared these feelings.</t6913> <t6914>We hurried out and took the things we had with us when we entered the Count's house from our rooms.</t6914> <t6915>The professor was ready with his materials, and when we met in the corridor, he pointed to them with importance and said:</t6915>
<t6916>“These will never leave my side, and they will not leave until this cursed task is finished.</t6916> <t6917>Be reasonable, my friends.</t6917> <t6918>What we are dealing with is not an ordinary enemy.</t6918> <t6919>Alas! How unfortunate that dear Madam Mina has to suffer!” He paused; his voice was cracking; I do not know whether anger or fear dominates my own heart.</t6919>
<t6920>We stood outside the Harkers' room.</t6920> <t6921>Art and Quincey stepped back, and Quincey spoke:</t6921>
<t6922>"Should we disturb him?</t6922><t6923>"</t6923>
<t6924>"We must do this," said Van Helsing sternly.</t6924> <t6925>"If the door is locked, I will force my way in.</t6925><t6926>"</t6926>
<t6927>“Doesn't this horrify her?</t6927> <t6928>Forcing one's way into a lady's room is quite unusual!” Van Helsing said solemnly:</t6928>
<t6929>“You are always right, but this is a matter of life and death.</t6929> <t6930>For the doctor, all rooms are the same, and even if they weren't, tonight they are all the same for me.</t6930> <t6931>My friend John, when I turn the doorknob, if the door doesn't open, will you put your shoulder to it and push; and you too, my friends.</t6931> <t6932>Now!</t6932><t6933>”</t6933>
<t6934>While talking, he turned the door handle, but the door did not yield.</t6934> <t6935>We threw ourselves at it; it suddenly opened with a crack, and we almost tumbled into the room head over heels.</t6935> <t6936>The professor actually fell, and as he was gathering himself on his hands and knees, I saw the scene before him.</t6936> <t6937>What I saw horrified me.</t6937> <t6938>I felt the hairs on the back of my neck stand up, and my heart almost stopped.</t6938>
<t6939>The moonlight was so bright that even through the thick yellow curtain, the room was illuminated enough to see the surroundings.</t6939> <t6940>Jonathan Harker was lying on the bed next to the window; his face was flushed, and he was breathing heavily as if he had fainted.</t6940> <t6941>On the side of the bed facing us was his wife, with her face turned outward, her face as white as chalk.</t6941> <t6942>Beside her stood a tall, thin man dressed in black.</t6942> <t6943>His face was not turned towards us, but as soon as we saw him, we all recognized the Count - in every aspect, down to the scar on his forehead.</t6943> <t6944>With his left hand, he had grasped both of Mrs. Harker's hands, holding them away from her body; with his right hand, he had seized Mrs. Harker by the nape of her neck, pressing her face against his chest.</t6944> <t6945>Mrs. Harker's white nightgown was stained with blood, and a thin strip of blood was flowing from the man's bare chest, visible through his torn-open clothing.</t6945> <t6946>Their posture was eerily reminiscent of a child plunging a kitten's nose into a bowl to make it drink milk.</t6946> <t6947>As soon as we burst into the room, the Count turned his face, and that previously described demonic look seemed to appear on his face.</t6947> <t6948>His eyes were glowing red with a demonic passion; the wide nostrils of his white, arched nose were flaring and trembling; the white sharp teeth behind his blood-dripping mouth's full lips clashed together like those of a wild animal.</t6948> <t6949>He flung his victim onto the bed with a violent jerk as if he had been thrown from a height, then turned and leaped at us.</t6949> <t6950>But during this time, the Professor had stood up and was holding the envelope containing the blessed bread towards him.</t6950> <t6951>The Count, just like Lucy had done outside her tomb, suddenly stopped and recoiled in fear.</t6951> <t6952>As we raised our crosses and advanced, he retreated further and further.</t6952> <t6953>A large, black cloud drifted across the sky, causing the moonlight to suddenly vanish, and when the gas lamp was lit by Quincey's match, we could see nothing but a faint wisp of smoke.</t6953> <t6954>It seemed to be slipping under the door, which had quickly opened and then returned to its original state.</t6954> <t6955>Van Helsing, Art, and I moved towards Mrs. Harker.</t6955> <t6956>By that moment, she had taken a deep breath and screamed with it.</t6956> <t6957>It was such a wild, ear-piercing, and despair-filled scream that I think it will continue to ring in my ears until the day I die.</t6957> <t6958>For a few seconds, she lay there helpless and disheveled.</t6958> <t6959>Her face was as pale as death, highlighted by the blood smeared on her lips, cheeks, and chin; a thin line of blood was flowing from her throat.</t6959> <t6960>Her eyes were wild with fear.</t6960> <t6961>Then, she brought her poor, clenched hands, which bore the red marks of the Count's terrible grip on their whiteness, to her face, and from behind her hands came a low, mournful moan that expressed that horrifying scream as a brief outburst of endless pain.</t6961> <t6962>Van Helsing stepped forward and gently covered her body with the bedspread, while Art, after looking at Mrs. Harker's face in despair for a moment, ran out of the room.</t6962> <t6963>Van Helsing whispered to me:</t6963>
<t6964>“Jonathan is in a fainting spell that we know could be caused by the Vampire.</t6964> <t6965>For a few minutes, we can't do anything for poor Madam Mina until he comes to; I must wake Jonathan!”</t6965> <t6966>He dipped the edge of a towel in water and began to gently pat his face with it; meanwhile, his wife was holding her face in her hands and sobbing heart-wrenchingly.</t6966> <t6967>I lifted the curtain and looked out the window.</t6967> <t6968>The moonlight was very bright, and as I looked out, I could see Quincey Morris running to the other end of the lawn and hiding behind a large yew tree.</t6968> <t6969>I was puzzled as to why he did this; but I heard the sound Harker made as he partially came to and returned to the bed.</t6969> <t6970>There was an expression of tremendous bewilderment on his face.</t6970> <t6971>He seemed dazed for a few minutes and then suddenly sprang up as if he had fully regained his senses.</t6971> <t6972>His wife was excited by his sudden movement and turned to him with her arms outstretched as if to embrace him, but instantly drew her arms back and brought her hands to her face, sobbing until the bed began to shake.</t6972>
<t6973>“For God's sake, what does all this mean?” cried Harker, “Dr. Seward, Dr. Van Helsing, what is happening?</t6973> <t6974>What is the problem?</t6974> <t6975>Mina, my dear, what happened?</t6975> <t6976>What does this blood mean?</t6976> <t6977>My God! My God! Did this also happen?”</t6977> <t6978>And he knelt down and clapped his hands together wildly.</t6978> <t6979>“Almighty God, help us!</t6979> <t6980>Help Mina!</t6980> <t6981>Oh, help Mina!” With a swift movement, he jumped out of bed and began to dress, - all his manhood awakened for a moment of effort.</t6981> <t6982>“What happened?</t6982> <t6983>Tell me everything!” He was shouting without stopping.</t6983> <t6984>“Dr. Van Helsing, you love Mina, I know.</t6984> <t6985>Oh, do something to save her.</t6985> <t6986>It cannot have gone too far yet.</t6986> <t6987>While I search for him, you keep an eye on Mina!” Amid all his fear, horror, and sorrow, his wife saw the danger he would face; she immediately forgot her own pain, grabbed Jonathan, and cried out:</t6987>
<t6988>“No! No! Jonathan, you must not leave me.</t6988> <t6989>God knows, tonight, apart from the fear of harming you, I have suffered enough pain.</t6989> <t6990>You must stay with me.</t6990> <t6991>You must stay with your friends who will protect and watch over you!” As she spoke, she looked as if she had gone mad, and when Jonathan gave in to her, she pulled him to the bed, sat him down, and hugged him tightly.</t6991>
<t6992>Van Helsing and I tried to calm them both down.</t6992> <t6993>The professor showed his small golden cross and said with perfect composure:</t6993>
<t6994>“Don't be afraid, dear.</t6994> <t6995>We are here and no harm can come to you while we are near.</t6995> <t6996>You are safe for tonight, stay calm and we should discuss this matter together.”</t6996> <t6997>Ms. Harker, resting her head on her husband's chest, trembled and remained silent.</t6997> <t6998>When she lifted her head, the places on her husband's white nightshirt where her lips had touched and the open wound on his neck were stained with blood.</t6998> <t6999>Upon seeing this, she recoiled with a feeble moan and whispered amidst the sobs that choked her:</t6999>
<t7000>“Sinner! Sinner! I must not touch her again, I must not kiss her again.</t7000> <t7001>How terrible it is that I am her worst enemy and the one she should fear the most!” In response, Jonathan resolutely said:</t7001>
<t7002>“This is nonsense, Mina.</t7002> <t7003>How shameful it is for you to say such a thing.</t7003> <t7004>I would not have expected to hear such a thing from you, and I don't want to hear it again.</t7004> <t7005>May God judge me as I deserve, and if anything comes between us through any action or desire of mine, may He punish me with a greater penalty than I now endure!” He extended his arms and drew his wife to his chest; for a while, Ms. Harker sobbed there.</t7005> <t7006>Over his wife's bowed head, he looked at us with wet eyes above his trembling nostrils; his mouth was as hard as steel.</t7006> <t7007>After a while, Ms. Harker's sobs became less frequent and weaker; then, Jonathan, with a forced calmness that I felt strained his nerves to the utmost, said to me:</t7007>
<t7008>“Yes, now Dr. Seward, tell me everything.”</t7008> <t7009>“I know the general outlines very well; tell me everything that has happened.”</t7009> <t7010>I told him exactly what had happened, and he listened to me with apparent indifference, but as I described how the Count's ruthless hands held his wife in that horrible and terrifying position - her mouth over the open wound on the Count's chest - his nostrils twitched and his eyes blazed.</t7010> <t7011>Even then, while passion was evident on the white face above the bowed head, I was struck by the sight of his hands gently and tenderly stroking her disheveled hair.</t7011> <t7012>I had just finished speaking when Quincey and Godalming knocked on the door.</t7012> <t7013>Upon our invitation, they entered the room.</t7013> <t7014>Van Helsing looked at me with questioning eyes.</t7014> <t7015>I understood that he wanted to ask if we could use Quincey and Godalming's arrival to divert the attention of this unhappy couple from each other and themselves, if such a thing were possible; thus, upon my nod of agreement, Van Helsing asked them what they had seen and done.</t7015> <t7016>Lord Godalming responded to this:</t7016>
<t7017>“I didn't see him anywhere in the corridor or in any of our rooms.</t7017> <t7018>I looked in the study, but although he had been there, he had left.</t7018> <t7019>But...” He suddenly fell silent, looking at the exhausted person in the bed.</t7019> <t7020>Van Helsing said seriously:</t7020>
<t7021>“Go on, my friend Arthur.</t7021> <t7022>We don't want any more secrets here.</t7022> <t7023>Our hope now is to know everything.</t7023> <t7024>Speak freely!” Thus, Art continued his words:</t7024>
<t7025>“Although he had been there and stayed for only a few seconds, he had turned the room upside down.</t7025> <t7026>All the writings were burned, blue flames flickered among the white ashes; the phonograph's cylinders were also thrown into the fire, and the wax had helped the flames.”</t7026> <t7027>I interrupted him here.</t7027> <t7028>“Thank God, there is another copy in the safe!” His face brightened for a moment, but then fell again as he continued: “Then, I ran down the stairs but I couldn't see any trace of him.</t7028> <t7029>I looked into Renfield's room, but there was no trace there either!..”</t7029> <t7030>He fell silent again.</t7030> <t7031>“Go on,” said Harker in a hoarse voice; thus, Art bowed his head and, licking his lips, added: “But the poor man was dead.” Ms. Harker raised her head and looked at each of us in turn, saying solemnly:</t7031>
<t7032>“God's will be done!” I couldn't help but feel that Arthur was hiding something, but I didn't say anything because I understood there was a reason for it.</t7032> <t7033>Van Helsing turned to Morris and asked:</t7033>
<t7034>“Well, my friend Quincey, do you have anything to tell?</t7034><t7035>”</t7035>
<t7036>“A little,” he replied.</t7036> <t7037>“In the end, it could be a lot, but for now, I can't say.</t7037> <t7038>If such a thing is possible, I thought it would be good to know where the Count went after leaving the house.</t7038> <t7039>I didn't see him, but I saw a bat flying west from Renfield's room.</t7039> <t7040>I was expecting to see him return to Carfax in some way, but clearly, he was looking for another refuge.</t7040> <t7041>He won't come back tonight, because the sky is reddening in the east and dawn is near.</t7041> <t7042>We must work tomorrow!</t7042><t7043>”</t7043>
<t7044>He spoke his final words through his clenched teeth.</t7044> <t7045>There was a silence that lasted perhaps one or two minutes, and I thought I could hear our heartbeats; then Van Helsing, gently placing his hand on Ms. Harker's head, said:</t7045>
<t7046>“And now Madam Mina -poor, dear, dear Madam Mina- tell us exactly what happened.</t7046> <t7047>God knows I don't want you to suffer, but it is necessary for us to know everything.</t7047> <t7048>Because now, we must conduct our work faster and more perfectly than ever before, and this is no joke.</t7048> <t7049>If it can be, the day that will end everything is approaching, and we now have the chance to live and learn.</t7049><t7050>”</t7050>
<t7051>The poor, dear lady trembled and as she pulled her husband closer and buried her head deeper into his chest, I could see how her nerves were strained.</t7051> <t7052>Then she lifted her head proudly and extended one hand to Van Helsing; Van Helsing took this hand between his own, bowed respectfully and kissed it, then quickly squeezed it.</t7052> <t7053>Her other hand was clasped with the hand of her husband, who was protecting her with his other arm wrapped around her body.</t7053> <t7054>After a pause, during which she seemed to gather her thoughts, she began to speak:</t7054>
<t7055>"I took the sleeping pill you gave me with great delicacy, but it didn't take effect for a long time.</t7055> <t7056>It was as if my sleep had become even more alert, and my mind began to fill with countless horrific thoughts - all related to death, vampires, blood, pain, and distress."</t7056> <t7057>Her husband groaned involuntarily and turned to her lovingly, saying: "My concerns, my dear.</t7057> <t7058>You must be brave and strong and help me in this dreadful task.</t7058> <t7059>If you knew how much effort it took for me to recount this terrifying event, you would understand how much I need your help.</t7059> <t7060>Well, if it would be of any benefit to me, I realized that I needed to help the medicine work with my own will, and so, I resolutely went to sleep.</t7060> <t7061>I must have fallen asleep shortly after, because I don't remember the rest.</t7061> <t7062>Jonathan's arrival did not wake me, because in the next moment, Jonathan was lying beside me.</t7062> <t7063>There was a thin, white mist in the room, which I had noticed before.</t7063> <t7064>But now I forgot whether you knew this; you will find it in my journal, which I will show you later.</t7064> <t7065>I once again felt the same inexplicable fear and the same sense of someone's presence that I had felt before.</t7065> <t7066>I turned in bed to wake Jonathan, but I saw that he was sleeping quite deeply, as if he had taken the sleeping pill instead of me.</t7066> <t7067>I tried to wake him but could not succeed.</t7067> <t7068>This frightened me greatly, and I looked around in terror.</t7068> <t7069>Then my heart truly leaped into my mouth: Beside the bed, as if emerging from the mist - or rather, as if the mist had turned into a person, because the mist had completely disappeared - stood a tall, thin man dressed entirely in black.</t7069> <t7070>I recognized him from the descriptions of others.</t7070> <t7071>A face as white as a candle; a face where the light fell as a thin white line, an arched nose; lips parted to reveal sharp white teeth; the red eyes I seemed to have seen in the window at sunset in St.</t7071> <t7072>Mary's Church in Whitby.</t7072> <t7073>I also knew the scar on his forehead that Jonathan had left when he struck him.</t7073> <t7074>For a moment, my heart stopped, I would have screamed but I was paralyzed.</t7074> <t7075>He spoke in a sharp and harsh whisper, pointing to Jonathan:</t7075>
<t7076>“‘Be quiet!</t7076> <t7077>If you make a sound, I'll take it and blow your brains out right in front of your eyes.’</t7077> <t7078>I was terrified, too stunned to do or say anything.</t7078> <t7079>With a mocking smile, he placed one hand on my shoulder and, holding me tightly, exposed my neck with his other hand; while doing so, he said: ‘First, a light drink as a reward for my efforts.</t7079> <t7080>You better be quiet; this isn't the first or second time your veins have quenched my thirst!’ I was bewildered, and strangely enough, I didn't want to stop him.</t7080> <t7081>I think this is part of the terrible curse that emerges when he touches his victim.</t7081> <t7082>And oh, my God! My God! Have mercy on me! He pressed his foul-smelling lips against my throat!” Her husband groaned again.</t7082> <t7083>Ms. Harker held his hand tighter and looked at him with pity as if she were the one injured, and continued her words:</t7083>
<t7084>“I felt my strength slowly draining away, I was half-unconscious.</t7084> <t7085>I don't know how long this horrifying thing lasted, but it felt like a long time before he withdrew his foul-smelling, terrible, and mocking lips.</t7085> <t7086>I saw fresh blood dripping from his lips!” For a while, it seemed that what she remembered affected her deeply, and she lost her strength, and if it weren't for her husband's arm holding her, she would have fallen and fainted.</t7086> <t7087>With great effort, she pulled herself together and continued to speak:</t7087>
<t7088>“Then he spoke mockingly: ‘So, you too, like the others, are trying to outwit me.</t7088> <t7089>You are helping these men in hunting me down and hindering my goals!</t7089> <t7090>Now you know what it means to stand in my way - they know it partially and soon they will learn it completely.</t7090> <t7091>They should have saved their strength to use near their homes.</t7091> <t7092>While they play mind games with me - me, who has commanded nations, schemed for nations, and fought for nations for hundreds of years before they were even born - I am defeating them.</t7092> <t7093>And you, their favorite, are now flesh of my flesh, blood of my blood, my kin, for a while you are my generous wine press and in the future, you will be my friend, my helper.</t7093> <t7094>In return, your revenge will be taken, because not one of them will be able to meet their needs.</t7094> <t7095>But still, you will be punished for what you have done.</t7095> <t7096>You helped to hinder me; now you must come at my call.</t7096> <t7097>Whenever my mind says to you “Come,” you will cross lands or seas to fulfill my command; that is enough!’ Saying this, he opened his shirt and with his long sharp nails, he cut a vein in his chest.</t7097> <t7098>When the blood started to gush out, he held my hands tightly with one hand and with the other, he grabbed my neck and pressed my mouth to the wound so that I would either suffocate or drink his blood...</t7098> <t7099>Oh, my God! My God! What have I done?</t7099> <t7100>I, who have tried to act with humility and honesty all my life, what have I done to deserve such a fate?</t7100> <t7101>God, have mercy on me!</t7101> <t7102>Look upon this poor servant who has fallen into a fate worse than mortal danger; have mercy on those who love him!” Then, as if wanting to cleanse himself from filth, he began to rub his lips.</t7102>
<t7103>As Ms. Harker recounted this dreadful story, the sky in the east began to brighten, and everything became clearer.</t7103> <t7104>Harker was calm and silent, but as this horrific narrative continued, a gloomy expression, deepening in the morning light, settled on her face.</t7104> <t7105>So much so that, as the first red streaks of the coming dawn quickly rose, her flesh stood out with its dark tone against the whitening hair in front of it.</t7105>
<t7106>We decided to stay within a distance where the unhappy couple could call out until one of us organized and took action.</t7106>
<t7107>I am certain of this: The Sun, in its great daily journey, will not rise over a house more unhappy than this.</t7107>
<t7108>XXII</t7108>
<t7109>Jonathan Harker's journal</t7109>
<t7110>October 3.</t7110> <t7111>- I am writing this journal because I will go mad if I don't do something.</t7111> <t7112>It's six o'clock, in half an hour we will gather in the study and have something to eat; Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward agree that we cannot work at our best if we do not eat.</t7112> <t7113>God knows, we need to do our best work today.</t7113> <t7114>I must keep writing at every opportunity, because I dare not stop thinking.</t7114> <t7115>Everything, big or small, must be put into writing; perhaps in the end, it will be the small things that teach us the most.</t7115> <t7116>No lesson, big or small, could put Mina or me in a worse situation than we are in today.</t7116> <t7117>Still, we must have faith and hope.</t7117> <t7118>Just a moment ago, poor Mina, with tears streaming down her beautiful cheeks, said that our faith is tested by troubles and hardships, that we must continue to be faithful, and that God will help us to the end.</t7118> <t7119>The end! Oh, God! The end of what?..</t7119> <t7120>Work! Work!</t7120>
<t7121>When Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward returned from their visit to poor Renfield, we set to work on the task that needed to be done with seriousness.</t7121> <t7122>First, Dr. Seward recounted that when he and Dr. Van Helsing went to the room downstairs, they found Renfield collapsed on the floor.</t7122> <t7123>His face was bruised and battered, and his neck bones were broken.</t7123>
<t7124>Dr. Seward had asked the nurse on duty in the corridor if he had heard anything.</t7124> <t7125>He said that he was sitting when loud noises came from the room, and immediately afterward, Renfield loudly shouted, "My God! My God! My God!" repeatedly - he also admitted to being half-asleep.</t7125> <t7126>After that, there was a sound of something falling, and when he entered the room, he found Renfield lying face down on the floor, as the doctors had seen.</t7126> <t7127>Van Helsing asked if he heard "a sound" or "sounds," and the nurse said he couldn't tell; at first, it seemed like there were two people, but since there was no one else in the room, it must have been just one person.</t7127> <t7128>He could swear, if necessary, that the words "My God!" were spoken by the patient.</t7128> <t7129>Dr. Seward, when we were alone, said he didn't want to delve into the matter, that the issue needed to be evaluated, and that the truth would never come out because no one would believe it.</t7129> <t7130>In this case, based on the nurse's testimony, he said he could issue a death certificate stating that the death was due to a fall from the bed.</t7130> <t7131>If the coroner requested, an official investigation would be conducted and would reach the same conclusion.</t7131>
<t7132>When the question of what our next step would be began to be discussed, the first decision we made was to tell Mina everything, no matter how painful it might be, and to hide nothing from her.</t7132> <t7133>She herself agreed that this was wise; it was heartbreaking to see her so brave, yet at the same time so sad and in deep despair.</t7133> <t7134>"There should be no more secrets from now on," she said, "Unfortunately, we have had many secrets up until now.</t7134> <t7135>And besides, there is nothing in the world that could cause me more pain than what I have endured so far - and what I am enduring now!</t7135> <t7136>No matter what, it should give me new hope or new courage!" As she spoke, Van Helsing, who had been staring at Mina, suddenly said quietly:</t7136>
<t7137>“But dear Madam Mina, are you not afraid; if not for yourself, then for those close to you after all that has happened?” The lines on Mina's face hardened, but as she responded, her eyes sparkled with the self-sacrifice of someone who sacrifices themselves:</t7137>
<t7138>“Ah, no! Because I have made my decision!</t7138><t7139>”</t7139>
<t7140>"Why?" asked Van Helsing politely; we were all very quiet at that moment because we all had a vague idea of what Mina meant.</t7140> <t7141>The answer came with a clarity as if stating a fact.</t7141>
<t7142>"Because if I find any indication that I could harm someone I love - and I will be observing carefully for this - I will die!" Van Helsing asked in a hoarse voice, "You are not going to kill yourself, are you?"</t7142>
<t7143>"I will kill; if I have no friend to save me from such pain and such a hopeless effort!" While speaking, he looked meaningfully at Van Helsing.</t7143> <t7144>The professor was sitting, but now he stood up and approached Mina, putting his hand to his head and said seriously:</t7144>
<t7145>“My child, if it is for your own good, such a person will be.</t7145> <t7146>For my part, if this is the best, even now, I would take the responsibility before God to prepare such a euthanasia for you.</t7146> <t7147>No, if it will be safe!</t7147> <t7148>But my child...”</t7148> <t7149>For a moment, she felt like she was choking and a great sob rose from her throat, she continued her words by swallowing:</t7149>
<t7150>“There are some who will stand between you and death here.</t7150> <t7151>You must not die by anyone's hand; especially not by your own.</t7151> <t7152>You must not die until that other, who has wronged your sweet life, tastes true death, for if he is still among the living Undead, your death will make you more like him.</t7152> <t7153>No, you must live! Even if death seems like an unspeakable blessing, you must fight and strive to live.</t7153> <t7154>Whether it comes to you with pain or joy, by day or by night, in safety or in danger, you must fight against Death itself!</t7154> <t7155>Until this great evil is buried in the past, I charge your living soul with this duty; you must not die - moreover, you must not even think of death.”</t7155> <t7156>My poor darling turned as white as a corpse, trembling and shaking as I have seen in the marshes with the rising tides.</t7156> <t7157>At last, she calmed a little and turned to Van Helsing, extending her hand to him sweetly but with great sorrow, and said:</t7157>
<t7158>“I promise you, dear friend, if God allows me to live, I will strive for this; until the time comes when this horror leaves me.”</t7158> <t7159>He was so good and so kind-hearted that we all felt our hearts strengthened to work and endure for him, and we began to discuss what we should do.</t7159> <t7160>I told him to take all the documents in the safe, all the papers, diaries, and the phonograph that we might use later, and to keep records again as he used to.</t7160> <t7161>The possibility of doing something pleased him - if “pleasure” could be used for such a relentless pursuit.</t7161>
<t7162>As usual, Van Helsing had thought ahead of everyone and had prepared the exact order of our tasks.</t7162>
<t7163>“Maybe,” he said, “it was good that we decided not to do anything about the soil boxes standing there during the meeting we held after our visit to Carfax.</t7163> <t7164>If we had done something, the Count would have guessed our purpose and undoubtedly taken precautions in advance to thwart our efforts regarding the other boxes, but now he does not know our purpose.</t7164> <t7165>No, moreover, he does not know that we have the power to purify his refuges, so he cannot use them as he used to.</t7165> <t7166>What we know about the locations of the boxes has increased so much that when we examine the house in Piccadilly, we can even trace the last boxes.</t7166> <t7167>So, today belongs to us, and our hope lies in today.</t7167> <t7168>The sun rising over our sorrow will protect us during its course.</t7168> <t7169>Until the sun sets tonight, that monster must maintain its current form.</t7169> <t7170>It is confined within the boundaries of its earthly outer shell.</t7170> <t7171>It cannot dissolve into the air, pass through cracks or crevices, and disappear.</t7171> <t7172>If it is to pass through the door, it must open the door like any mortal.</t7172> <t7173>And for this reason, we have today to search all its refuges and purify them.</t7173> <t7174>If we have not yet caught and destroyed it, we will undoubtedly catch and destroy it somewhere in time.”</t7174> <t7175>Here, I jumped to my feet because I could not control myself when I thought of these very precious minutes and seconds filled with Mina's life and happiness slipping away while we talked about possible actions.</t7175> <t7176>But Van Helsing raised his hand to warn me.</t7176> <t7177>“No, my friend Jonathan,” he said, “In this matter, as your proverb says, the fastest way home is the longest way.</t7177> <t7178>When the time comes, we will all take action and act very quickly.</t7178> <t7179>But think, the key to the situation is most likely in the house in Piccadilly.</t7179> <t7180>The Count may have bought many houses.</t7180> <t7181>He has purchase documents, keys, and other things related to them.</t7181> <t7182>There will be papers he will write on; there will be a checkbook.</t7182> <t7183>He has many items he needs to keep somewhere; why shouldn't these be in such a central, such a quiet place where he can enter through the front or back door at any moment, even at the busiest time of traffic, without anyone noticing!</t7183> <t7184>We will go there, search that house, and when we find out what is inside, as Arthur's hunting saying goes, we will ‘block the den’ and weaken our old fox - right?”</t7184> <t7185>“Then let's start immediately,” I shouted, “we are wasting precious, precious time!” The Professor did not move and only said:</t7185>
<t7186>“So, how are we going to get into the house on Piccadilly?</t7186><t7187>”</t7187>
<t7188>“Whatever it takes!” I shouted.</t7188> <t7189>“If necessary, we will force our way in.</t7189><t7190>”</t7190>
<t7191>“So, what about your police officers; where will they be and what will they say?</t7191><t7192>”</t7192>
<t7193>I was disappointed, but I knew that if he wanted to postpone it, he had a good reason for it.</t7193> <t7194>Therefore, I said as quietly as I could:</t7194>
<t7195>“Don't wait longer than necessary; I'm sure you know what kind of torture I'm going through.</t7195><t7196>”</t7196>
<t7197>“Ah, my child, I know; truly, I have no desire to increase your pain.</t7197> <t7198>But think about what we can do until the whole world takes action.</t7198> <t7199>That's when our turn will come.</t7199> <t7200>I have thought it over and I am convinced that the easiest way is the best.</t7200> <t7201>Now, we want to enter the house, but we don't have the key, do we?”</t7201> <t7202>I nodded in agreement.</t7202>
<t7203>“Now, imagine that you actually own that house and you can't get inside, and imagine that you also don't have the consciousness of a thief, what would you do?</t7203><t7204>”</t7204>
<t7205>“I would find a reputable locksmith and have them pick the lock for me.</t7205><t7206>”</t7206>
<t7207>“Well, what about your police officers, would they get involved or not?</t7207><t7208>”</t7208>
<t7209>“Ah, no! If they knew the man was assigned according to the rules, they wouldn't interfere.</t7209><t7210>”</t7210>
<t7211>"Then," he said, looking at me with sharp eyes while speaking, "the only uncertain thing is the employer's conscience and your police officers' belief regarding whether that employer has a clean conscience or not.</t7211> <t7212>Your police officers, given that they trouble themselves with such a matter, must be willing and smart - oh, how smart - in reading the human heart.</t7212> <t7213>No, no, my friend Jonathan, even if you unlock a hundred empty houses in your London or any other city in the world and do the job as it should be done, no one will interfere with your work.</t7213> <t7214>I had read the story of a gentleman who had a very nice house in your London and went to Switzerland for a few months in the summer, closing up his house, only for a thief to break in through the back window.</t7214> <t7215>Then, the thief went and opened the shutters in the front and entered and exited through the door right in front of the police.</t7215> <t7216>After that, he held an auction in the house, announced it, placed a big advertisement, and on the day it came, sold everything the other man owned through a major auctioneer.</t7216> <t7217>Then he went to a contractor and sold the house to him, agreeing to demolish it and clear it all away within a certain period.</t7217> <t7218>And your police and other authorities provided him with all the help they could.</t7218> <t7219>And when that homeowner returned from his Swiss vacation, he found nothing but a big empty space where his house used to be.</t7219> <t7220>All of this was done en règle, and we will act en règle while doing our job.</t7220> <t7221>We won't go so early that the police, who don't have much to think about at those hours, will find the situation strange; we'll go after ten, at a time when there will be many people around and such things would be done by the real owners of the house.</t7221><t7222>"</t7222>
<t7223>I could do nothing but see how right he was, and the terrible despair on Mina's face eased; in such a good view, there was hope.</t7223> <t7224>Van Helsing continued his words:</t7224>
<t7225>“Once we get into the house, we might find more clues; while some of us stay there, others will find the other places where more earth boxes might be - the places in Bermondsey and Mile End.”</t7225><t7226>”</t7226>
<t7227>Lord Godalming stood up.</t7227> <t7228>"I can be useful here," he said.</t7228> <t7229>"I will send a telegram to my men to have the horses and carriages ready at the nearest locations."</t7229><t7230>"</t7230>
<t7231>“Look here, old friend,” said Morris, “even though we decided to go on horseback, it's important to keep everything ready, but don't you think that one of their fancy carriages adorned with the family crest being seen on one of the side roads of Walworth or Mile End would be too conspicuous for our purposes?</t7231> <t7232>It seems to me that we should take hired carriages when heading south or east and even leave them near the neighborhood we're going to.</t7232><t7233>”</t7233>
<t7234>"My friend Quincey is right!" said the Professor.</t7234> <t7235>"As you say, head at horizon level.</t7235> <t7236>The task we are about to undertake is difficult, and if possible, we do not want people watching us.</t7236><t7237>"</t7237>
<t7238>I was glad to see that Mina's interest in the events was increasing and that the rapid progression of the events was helping her forget the terrible experience she had at night for a while.</t7238> <t7239>She was very, very pale - almost like a corpse, and she was so thin that her lips had drawn back slightly, making her teeth look a bit protruding.</t7239> <t7240>I did not mention this last part to avoid causing her unnecessary pain, but thinking about what happened to poor Lucy when the Count sucked her blood was chilling my blood.</t7240> <t7241>So far, there was no indication that her teeth were starting to sharpen, but it had been a short time and we still had time to be afraid.</t7241>
<t7242>When it came to discussing the order of our tasks and the distribution of our forces, new reasons for doubt emerged.</t7242> <t7243>In the end, we decided that we needed to destroy the Count's nearby refuge before setting out for Piccadilly.</t7243> <t7244>If he understands this too early, we will still be ahead of him in our task of destruction, and his existence, in its purely material form and weakest state, may offer us some new clues.</t7244>
<t7245>As for the arrangement of forces, the Professor suggested that after our visit to Carfax, we should enter the house in Piccadilly; while Lord Godalming and Quincey found and destroyed the refuges in Walworth and Mile End, the two doctors and I should stay in Piccadilly.</t7245> <t7246>Although not very convincing, the Professor insisted that there was a possibility that the Count might be in Piccadilly during the day, and if so, we could deal with him right there.</t7246> <t7247>In any case, we could track him with all our might.</t7247> <t7248>Since my departure was also in question, I opposed this plan with all my strength, saying, "Because I intend to stay here and protect Mina."</t7248> <t7249>I thought I was determined on this matter, but Mina did not listen to my objection.</t7249> <t7250>She said that there might be a legal situation where I could be useful, that due to my experiences in Transylvania, there might be a clue among the Count's documents that only I could understand, and in that case, we needed all the strength we could gather to deal with the Count's extraordinary power.</t7250> <t7251>Since Mina's decision was final, I had to give in; she said that working together was her last hope.</t7251> <t7252>"As for me," she said, "I am not afraid of anything.</t7252> <t7253>Everything is already as bad as it can be, and there must be an element of hope or consolation in everything that could happen.</t7253> <t7254>Go, my dear husband! God, if He wills, can protect me when I am alone just as He can when someone is with me."</t7254> <t7255>So I jumped up, shouting, "Then for God's sake, let's leave immediately because we are wasting time.</t7255> <t7256>The Count might arrive in Piccadilly earlier than we thought.</t7256><t7257>"</t7257>
<t7258>"No, it's not like that!" said Van Helsing, raising his hand.</t7258>
<t7259>“But why?” I asked.</t7259>
<t7260>“Last night,” he said with a genuine smile, “did you forget that you had a heavy feast and would sleep until late hours?</t7260><t7261>”</t7261>
<t7262>Forget? Never!</t7262><t7263>How could I ever forget - will I ever be able to forget?</t7263><t7264>Can any of us ever forget that horrifying scene?</t7264><t7265>Mina was making a great effort to maintain her brave appearance, but the pain overcame her, she brought her hands to her face and trembled while moaning.</t7265><t7266>Van Helsing did not want to remind her of the terrible experience she had gone through.</t7266><t7267>However, in his mental struggle, he had completely forgotten Mina and her role in this incident.</t7267><t7268>When he realized what he had said, he was horrified by his thoughtlessness and tried to comfort Mina.</t7268><t7269>"Oh, Madam Mina!" he said, "Dear, dear Madam Mina, it is such a pity that someone like me, who holds you in such high regard, would say something so thoughtless!</t7269><t7270>These foolish old lips and this foolish old head of mine do not deserve it, but you will forget this, won't you?"</t7270><t7271>As he said this, he leaned in close to Mina; Mina, looking at him through her tears, took his hand and said in a choked voice:</t7271>
<t7272>“No, I will not forget because it is good for me to remember; however, I have so many sweet memories of you all that I keep them all together.</t7272> <t7273>Now, soon you all have to go.</t7273> <t7274>Breakfast is ready and it is essential for all of us to eat so that we can be strong.</t7274><t7275>”</t7275>
<t7276>Breakfast was a strange meal for all of us.</t7276> <t7277>We tried to be cheerful and encourage each other, and Mina was the liveliest and most cheerful among us.</t7277> <t7278>Van Helsing stood up and said:</t7278>
<t7279>“Now, my dear friends, we set out on our dreadful enterprise.</t7279> <t7280>Are we all armed as we were on that first night when we visited our enemy's lair; armed against both spiritual and bodily attack?”</t7280> <t7281>We all assured him on this point.</t7281> <t7282>“Good then.</t7282> <t7283>Now, Madam Mina, you are quite safe here in any case until sunrise, and by then we shall have returned - if we return!</t7283> <t7284>But before we go, let me see you are armed against personal attack.</t7284> <t7285>Since your descent, I have prepared your room by placing the things we know so that He may not enter.</t7285> <t7286>Let me take precautions for you as well.</t7286> <t7287>In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, this blessed bread upon your forehead...</t7287><t7288>”</t7288>
<t7289>Mina let out a terrifying scream that almost froze our hearts.</t7289> <t7290>As soon as the Professor touched the blessed bread to Mina's forehead, it seemed to sear and burn her flesh as if it were a piece of red-hot metal.</t7290> <t7291>The brain of my poor beloved grasped the significance of this truth as quickly as her nerves conveyed the pain, and these two things affected her so much that her distressed nature found voice in that horrifying scream.</t7291> <t7292>But words quickly came to her; when the reaction came, the echo of the scream was still ringing in the air, and she fell to her knees with the pain of her wounded pride.</t7292> <t7293>Like lepers used to hide themselves with their coverings, she pulled her beautiful hair over her face and cried out bitterly:</t7293>
<t7294>“Sinner! Sinner! Even the Almighty God keeps away from my filthy skin!”</t7294> <t7295>“I must bear this stain of shame on my forehead until the Day of Judgment.”</t7295> <t7296>Everyone fell silent.</t7296> <t7297>With the pain of a desperate sorrow, I threw myself beside him and wrapped my arms around him tightly.</t7297> <t7298>While our friends around us turned their tear-filled eyes away in silence, our hearts beat together in pain for a few minutes.</t7298> <t7299>Then Van Helsing turned and began to speak seriously; he was so serious that I couldn't help but feel he was inspired and speaking things beyond himself:</t7299>
<t7300>“Without a doubt, God will repair all the mistakes made by the world and the children He placed there on Judgment Day, so it is possible that you may have to bear this stain until the time He deems appropriate.</t7300> <t7301>And oh, Madam Mina, dear, dear, we who love you hope to be there to see that the red scar, which is a sign that God knows what has happened, has passed and left your forehead as clean as the heart we know.</t7301> <t7302>Because we know as well as our own lives that when God finds it right to lift the great burden from us, that scar will also pass.</t7302> <t7303>Until then, we will carry our Cross just as His Son obeyed His will.</t7303> <t7304>Perhaps we are the instruments chosen for His sweet joy, and just as the other rose with blows and shame, with tears and blood, with doubts and fears, and with everything that separates man from God, we too will rise by His command.</t7304><t7305>”</t7305>
<t7306>There was hope and solace in his words, and it led to resignation.</t7306> <t7307>Mina and I felt this way, and at the same time, we both held one of the old man's hands, leaned over, and kissed it.</t7307> <t7308>Then, without saying a word, we all knelt together, holding hands, and vowed to remain faithful to each other.</t7308> <t7309>We men swore to lift the veil of sorrow covering the face of Mina, whom we all loved in our own way, and prayed to God to help and guide us in the dreadful task ahead.</t7309>
<t7310>Then, the time came to get to work.</t7310> <t7311>Therefore, I bid farewell to Mina; it was a departure we would not forget until the day of our death, and we set off.</t7311>
<t7312>I was determined about one thing: If we were to find out that Mina had to become a vampire in the end, she would not go to that unknown and terrifying place alone.</t7312> <t7313>I think this is why, in the past, a single vampire meant many vampires; just as their disgusting bodies could only rest on consecrated ground, the most sacred love also recruits soldiers into their vile ranks.</t7313>
<t7314>We entered Carfax without any trouble and found everything in its place on the first try.</t7314> <t7315>In such an ordinary environment of neglect, dust, and decay, it was hard to believe that such a familiar horror could have a foothold.</t7315> <t7316>If we were not determined and if it were not for the terrifying memories that spurred us on, we might have struggled to make progress in our task.</t7316> <t7317>We found no documents or any indication of the house's use, and the boxes in the old chapel stood as they did the last time we saw them.</t7317> <t7318>As we stood in front of the boxes, Dr. Van Helsing said solemnly:</t7318>
<t7319>“And now, my friends, we have a duty here.</t7319> <t7320>We must cleanse this soil, which he brought from afar for such a dreadful purpose, of its sacred memories.</t7320> <t7321>He chose this soil because it is blessed.</t7321> <t7322>Thus, we will defeat him with his own weapon, for we will make this soil even more sacred.</t7322> <t7323>It was blessed for man to use in this way, now we are blessing it for God.”</t7323> <t7324>As he spoke, he took a screwdriver and a wrench out of his bag, and shortly after, the lid of one of the chests was opened.</t7324> <t7325>The soil smelled musty; but somehow we didn't seem to mind, because all our attention was on the Professor.</t7325> <t7326>He took a piece of blessed bread from its box and respectfully placed it on the soil, then began to screw the lid back on; as he worked, we were helping him.</t7326>
<t7327>We performed the same operation on each of the large chests one by one and left them, from the outside, as we found them; but inside each of them was a piece of blessed bread.</t7327>
<t7328>When we closed the door behind us, the Professor said solemnly:</t7328>
<t7329>"We have done this much already.</t7329> <t7330>If we can be as successful with the others, tonight's sunset may shine on Madam Mina's forehead as white and spotless as ivory!</t7330><t7331>"</t7331>
<t7332>As we crossed the grassy area on the way to the station to catch our train, we could see the front facade of the mental hospital.</t7332> <t7333>I eagerly looked in that direction and saw Mina at the window of my room.</t7333> <t7334>I waved to her and nodded to indicate that our task there had been successfully completed.</t7334> <t7335>She also nodded in response to show that she understood.</t7335> <t7336>The last I saw of her, she was waving goodbye.</t7336> <t7337>We barely reached the station and only just caught the train as it was hissing steam on the platform.</t7337>
<t7338>I wrote this on the train.</t7338>
<t7339>Piccadilly, 12:30.</t7339> <t7340>- As we were about to reach Fenchurch Street, Lord Godalming said to me:</t7340>
<t7341>“Quincey and I will find a locksmith.</t7341> <t7342>It would be better if you didn't come with us in case there's any trouble, because under these circumstances, it wouldn't look too bad for us to break into an empty house.</t7342> <t7343>But you are a lawyer, and the United Law Society might tell you that you shouldn't do this.”</t7343> <t7344>Since I hadn't yet shared any risk of reproach, I objected, but he continued: “Besides, if we are not too many, we will attract less attention.</t7344> <t7345>My title will help us deal with the locksmith and any police that might come.</t7345> <t7346>The best thing for you is to go with Jack and the Professor, stay somewhere in Green Park where you can see the house, and when you see the door open and the locksmith leave, come together.</t7346> <t7347>We will keep watch for you and let you in.</t7347><t7348>”</t7348>
<t7349>“This is a good suggestion,” said Van Helsing, and thus we didn't say anything further.</t7349> <t7350>Godalming and Morris hurriedly drove off in a rented carriage, and we followed them in another one.</t7350> <t7351>At the corner of Arlington Street, our group got out of the carriage and started wandering around Green Park.</t7351> <t7352>As soon as I saw the house, upon which our great hopes were concentrated, standing ugly and silent among its neighbors that looked more lively and orderly in comparison, my heart began to pound.</t7352> <t7353>We sat on a bench with a good view of the house and started smoking cigars to attract as little attention as possible.</t7353> <t7354>While waiting for the others to arrive, the minutes seemed to pass as heavy as lead.</t7354>
<t7355>Finally, we saw a four-wheeler arriving.</t7355> <t7356>Lord Godalming and Morris slowly got out of the carriage; a stout worker with a cross-woven tool basket in his hand got down from beside the coachman.</t7356> <t7357>Morris paid the coachman, who touched his hat and drove away.</t7357> <t7358>The two of them climbed the stairs together, and Lord Godalming showed what needed to be done.</t7358> <t7359>The worker slowly took off his jacket and, saying something to a passing policeman, hung it on one of the sharp points of the railings.</t7359> <t7360>The policeman nodded approvingly, and the man, kneeling on the ground, placed his bag beside him.</t7360>
<t7361>After searching inside for a while, he took out some tools and arranged them neatly beside him.</t7361> <t7362>Then, he stood up, looked through the keyhole, blew into it, and turned to his employers to say something.</t7362> <t7363>Lord Godalming smiled, and the man took a large bunch of keys in his hand, selected one, and began to test the lock as if trying to feel his way with it.</t7363> <t7364>After trying and failing for a while by feel, he tried a second one, then a third.</t7364> <t7365>Suddenly, the door opened with a slight push, and he and the locksmith entered the hall.</t7365> <t7366>We waited without moving; my cigar was burning brightly, but Van Helsing's had completely gone out.</t7366> <t7367>We waited patiently when we saw the worker go out and bring his bag inside.</t7367> <t7368>Then he kept the door ajar and steadied it with his knee while placing the key in the lock.</t7368> <t7369>Finally, he handed this key to Lord Godalming, who took out his wallet and gave him something.</t7369> <t7370>The man touched his hat, took his bag, put on his coat, and left; not a single person saw this entire process.</t7370>
<t7371>When Adam had gone quite a distance, the three of us crossed the street and knocked on the door.</t7371> <t7372>The door was immediately opened by Quincey Morris, behind whom stood Lord Godalming lighting his cigar.</t7372>
<t7373>As we entered, "This place smells disgusting," said Lord Godalming.</t7373> <t7374>Indeed, it smelled disgusting -like the old chapel at Carfax- and based on our past experience, we clearly understood that the Count had been using this place freely.</t7374> <t7375>We set out to explore the house; we moved together in case of an attack, because we knew we had a strong and cunning enemy to deal with, and we did not yet know if the Count was at home.</t7375> <t7376>In the dining room at the back of the hall, we found eight boxes of earth.</t7376> <t7377>Only eight of the nine boxes we were looking for! Our work was not finished, and it would never be until we found that missing box.</t7377> <t7378>First, we opened the shutters of a window overlooking a narrow courtyard with stone paving, on the empty side of a barn painted to look like the front of a small house.</t7378> <t7379>There were no windows in the barn, so we had no fear of being watched.</t7379> <t7380>We did not waste time examining the boxes.</t7380> <t7381>With the tools we had brought, we opened them one by one and did to them what we had done to the boxes in the old chapel.</t7381> <t7382>At that moment, it was clear that the Count was not at home, and we began to search for his personal belongings.</t7382>
<t7383>After quickly glancing through all the rooms from the basement to the attic, we concluded that everything that might belong to the Count was found in the dining room, and thus we began to carefully examine them.</t7383> <t7384>The items were arranged in a neat disorder on the large dining table.</t7384> <t7385>The deeds to the house in Piccadilly were in a large bundle, along with the purchase documents for the houses in Mile End and Bermondsey, letter papers, envelopes, pens, and ink.</t7385> <t7386>All of them were covered with a thin wrapping paper to protect them from dust.</t7386> <t7387>Additionally, there was a clothes brush, a brush and comb, a jug, and a bowl - the latter containing dirty water that appeared red, as if stained with blood.</t7387> <t7388>Finally, there was a bundle of keys of various types and sizes, likely belonging to the other houses.</t7388> <t7389>After examining this last finding, Lord Godalming and Quincey Morris, who were taking notes on the various addresses of the houses in the east and south, took a large bunch of keys and set out to destroy the boxes in those places.</t7389> <t7390>The rest of us are waiting as patiently as we can for their return - or for the Count's arrival.</t7390>
<t7391>XXIII</t7391>
<t7392>Dr. Seward's journal</t7392>
<t7393>October 3.</t7393> <t7394>- Time seemed to pass terribly slowly while waiting for the arrival of Godalming and Quincey Morris.</t7394> <t7395>The Professor tried to keep our minds constantly engaged to keep them active.</t7395> <t7396>From his occasional sideways glance at Harker, I could see his good intentions.</t7396> <t7397>The poor man was crushed under a pain that was terrible to witness.</t7397> <t7398>Last night, he was a man with a strong, young face, full of energy and with dark brown hair, looking sincere and happy.</t7398> <t7399>Today, however, he is a weary, grim-faced man with white hair, sunken, burning eyes, and deep lines of pain etched into his face.</t7399> <t7400>His energy is still intact; in fact, he is like a living flame.</t7400> <t7401>This might still be his salvation, because if everything goes well, it will help him in this desperate situation; then, somehow, he will awaken again to the realities of life.</t7401> <t7402>Poor man, I thought my own troubles were bad enough, but his!</t7402> <t7403>The Professor knows this very well and is doing his best to keep Harker's mind occupied.</t7403> <t7404>The things he was saying were interesting under these circumstances.</t7404> <t7405>As far as I can remember, it went like this:</t7405>
<t7406>“Since the day they came into my hands, I have repeatedly examined all the documents related to this monster, and the more I worked on them, the greater the necessity of its complete destruction seemed.</t7406> <t7407>In all of them, there are indicators of how it progressed; not only of its power but also of its knowledge of that power.</t7407> <t7408>From the research of my friend Arminius in Budapest, I learned that he was a perfect man while alive.</t7408> <t7409>A soldier, statesman, and alchemist - the latter being the greatest advancement in the science of his time.</t7409> <t7410>He had a great mind, an education incomparable to anyone else, and a heart that knew neither fear nor remorse.</t7410> <t7411>He even dared to enter Scholomance and there was no branch of knowledge he did not engage in during his lifetime.</t7411> <t7412>Well, his mental powers survived physical death; although, his memory seemed incomplete.</t7412> <t7413>In some aspects of the mind, he was like a child, and still is, but he is growing now, and some traits that were initially childish have now become fitting for a man.</t7413> <t7414>He is conducting experiments and doing it well, and if we had not stood in his way, he could have been the father or supporter of a new species whose path lies through Death, not Life - if we fail, he still might be.”</t7414> <t7415>Harker groaned and said: “And all this is plotted against my beloved!</t7415> <t7416>But how is he conducting experiments?</t7416> <t7417>This knowledge could help us defeat him!</t7417><t7418>”</t7418>
<t7419>"From the beginning, since his arrival, he has been slowly but surely testing his own strength; that great, childlike mind is at work.</t7419> <t7420>This is good for us because it is still a childlike mind; because if he had dared to attempt certain things at the very start, he would have surpassed our strength long ago.</t7420> <t7421>Nevertheless, he aims for success and a man with centuries ahead of him can afford to wait and progress slowly.</t7421> <t7422>His principle might be festina lente64.</t7422>
<t7423>“I don't understand,” said Harker wearily.</t7423> <t7424>“Oh, please speak more plainly with me!</t7424> <t7425>Perhaps sorrow and troubles are dulling my mind.</t7425><t7426>”</t7426>
<t7427>The professor gently placed his hand on Harker's shoulder as he spoke: "Ah, my child, I will speak plainly.</t7427> <t7428>Don't you see how this monster has recently been infiltrating knowledge in an experimental manner?</t7428> <t7429>How he used the zoophagous patient to enter our friend John's house; because your Vampire, although he could enter whenever and however he wanted later, could only enter initially when invited by someone from inside.</t7429> <t7430>But these are not the most important experiments.</t7430> <t7431>Don't we see how these large boxes were initially carried by others?</t7431> <t7432>At that time, he didn't know it had to be that way.</t7432> <t7433>But that great, childlike mind of his kept evolving, and then he thought about whether he could carry the box himself.</t7433> <t7434>So, he started helping the carriers, and then, seeing there was nothing to it, he tried to carry them alone.</t7434> <t7435>And thus he made progress and distributed his graves; now no one but him knows where they are hidden.</t7435> <t7436>He might have intended to bury them deep.</t7436> <t7437>Thus, he would only use them at night or when he could change form, both of which would suit his purpose, and no one would know these were his hiding places!</t7437> <t7438>But my child, do not despair; this knowledge came to him far too late!</t7438> <t7439>We have already purified all but one of his sanctuaries, and this will be dealt with before sunset.</t7439> <t7440>Then, he will have no place to move and hide.</t7440> <t7441>I did not allow us to act hastily this morning so that we could be sure.</t7441> <t7442>Don't we have much more at stake compared to him?</t7442> <t7443>Then why shouldn't we act more cautiously than him?</t7443> <t7444>According to my watch, it is one o'clock, and if all is well, our friends Arthur and Quincey have already set out towards us.</t7444> <t7445>Today is our day, and we must proceed with sure steps, even if slowly, and not miss any opportunity.</t7445> <t7446>Look! When those who are not with us now return, we will be five.</t7446><t7447>"</t7447>
<t7448>While he was speaking, we were startled by the knocking on the hall door, the double knock of the telegraph boy.</t7448> <t7449>With a single impulse, we all went out into the hall, and Van Helsing, raising his hand to signal us to be silent, went to the door and opened it.</t7449> <t7450>The boy handed over the delivery.</t7450> <t7451>The professor closed the door again, and after looking at the address, he opened the telegram and read it aloud:</t7451>
<t7452>Pay attention to D.</t7452> <t7453>Now, 12:45, he came hurriedly from Carfax and went quickly south.</t7453> <t7454>He seems to be turning back and may want to see you: Mina.</t7454>
<t7455>There was a silence broken by Jonathan Harker's voice: "Thank God, we will meet soon!" Van Helsing quickly turned to him and said:</t7455>
<t7456>“God will act in His own way and in His own time.</t7456> <t7457>For now, do not fear and do not rejoice because what we desire at this moment could be our ruin.</t7457><t7458>”</t7458>
<t7459>Jonathan replied excitedly, "I don't care about anything right now."</t7459> <t7460>"The only thing I care about is erasing this monster from the universe.</t7460> <t7461>I'd sell my soul to do it!</t7461><t7462>"</t7462>
<t7463>“Ah, hush, hush, my child!” said Van Helsing.</t7463> <t7464>“God does not buy souls in this way, and even if the devil does, he does not keep his word.</t7464> <t7465>But God is forgiving and just; He knows your pain and your devotion to dear Madam Mina.</t7465> <t7466>Think of how much more it will hurt her to hear these rebellious words.</t7466> <t7467>Do not fear any of us; we have all dedicated ourselves to this cause and will see it through to the end today.</t7467> <t7468>The time for action is coming; today this Vampire is limited by human power and will not be able to change until sunset.</t7468> <t7469>It will take time for him to arrive here - look, it is twenty past one - and there is still time before he can get here, he will never be that quick.</t7469> <t7470>We must hope that Lord Arthur and Quincey arrive first.” About half an hour after receiving Ms. Harker’s telegram, the hall door was knocked on quietly but firmly.</t7470> <t7471>It was the kind of ordinary knock that thousands of gentlemen make constantly, but it caused the Professor and me to feel our hearts beating loudly.</t7471> <t7472>We looked at each other and went out into the hall together; both of us ready to use our various weapons - the spiritual ones in the left hand, the deadly ones in the right hand.</t7472> <t7473>Van Helsing drew the bolt and opened the door halfway, stepping back with both hands ready for action.</t7473> <t7474>When we saw Lord Godalming and Quincey Morris on the threshold, close to the door, the joy in our hearts must have shown on our faces.</t7474> <t7475>They quickly came inside and closed the door behind them; as they moved through the hall, Lord Godalming began to speak:</t7475>
<t7476>"Everything is fine.</t7476> <t7477>We found both places; each had six chests and we destroyed them all!</t7477><t7478>"</t7478>
<t7479>"Did you get rid of it?" asked the Professor.</t7479>
<t7480>"From his perspective!" We remained silent for a minute, and then Quincey said:</t7480>
<t7481>“There is nothing to do here but wait.</t7481> <t7482>If he doesn't come back by five o'clock, we will need to set off; because it wouldn't be right to leave Ms. Harker alone after sunset.</t7482><t7483>”</t7483>
<t7484>“He will be here soon,” said Van Helsing, who was looking at his pocket notebook at the time.</t7484> <t7485>“Nota bene, Madam’s telegram says he went south of Carfax, which means he will cross the river and can only do so when the tide is low, which should be before one o’clock.</t7485> <t7486>His going south has significance for us.</t7486> <t7487>He is still only suspicious and went first to the place where he would encounter the least obstacles from Carfax.</t7487> <t7488>You must have been in Bermondsey just a little before him.</t7488> <t7489>The fact that he hasn’t come here yet indicates that he then went to Mile End.</t7489> <t7490>This must have taken some of his time, because after that, he must have been transported by some means on the river.</t7490> <t7491>Believe me, my friends, we won’t have to wait much longer from now on.</t7491> <t7492>We need to have an attack plan ready so that we don’t miss any opportunity.</t7492> <t7493>Shh! We have no more time.</t7493> <t7494>Get all your weapons!</t7494> <t7495>Be ready!” As he spoke, he gestured with his hand because we could all hear a key being slowly inserted into the lock of the hall door.</t7495> <t7496>Even in such a moment, I couldn’t help but admire the way the dominant spirit manifested itself.</t7496> <t7497>In all our hunting parties and adventures around the world, Quincey Morris has always been the one to draft the plan of action, and Arthur and I had become entirely accustomed to following him.</t7497> <t7498>Now that old habit seemed to have instinctively revived.</t7498> <t7499>After quickly scanning the room, Quincey organized our attack plan and, without saying a word, positioned each of us with hand signals.</t7499> <t7500>Van Helsing, Harker, and I moved right behind the door so that when it opened, the Professor wouldn’t miss it and the two of us could stand between the door and the person entering.</t7500> <t7501>Godalming stood at the back and Quincey at the front, ready to act without being seen in front of the window.</t7501> <t7502>We waited in a suspenseful doubt as the seconds passed like a nightmare.</t7502> <t7503>Slow and careful footsteps came in the hall; undoubtedly, the Count was ready for a surprise - at least he feared one.</t7503>
<t7504>Suddenly, with a single leap, he burst into the room; before any of us could raise a hand to stop him, he passed among us.</t7504> <t7505>There was something panther-like in his movement -something very inhuman that seemed to rouse us from the shock of his arrival.</t7505> <t7506>The first to act was Harker, who, with a swift motion, flung himself in front of the door leading to the front of the house.</t7506> <t7507>When the Count saw us, a terrible expression appeared on his face, showing his long and sharp canine teeth, but the demonic grin quickly gave way to a lion-like pride.</t7507> <t7508>When we all advanced on him with a single impulse, his facial expression changed again.</t7508> <t7509>It was a pity that we had not made a more organized plan of attack, for even at that moment, I was wondering what we would do.</t7509> <t7510>Personally, I did not know whether our deadly weapons would be of any help.</t7510> <t7511>Harker, clearly wanting to test this, prepared the large kukri and delivered a ruthless and unexpected blow to the Count with it.</t7511> <t7512>It was a powerful strike; however, the demonic speed of the Count's backward leap had protected him.</t7512> <t7513>If he had been a second late, the sharp blade would have cut through his heart.</t7513> <t7514>As it was, the kukri only cut through the fabric of his coat, and from the wide gash, a bundle of paper money and plenty of gold spilled out.</t7514> <t7515>The Count's expression was so diabolical that, even though I saw the terrible kukri being raised for another blow, I feared for Harker, and instinctively, with a protective impulse, I leaped forward with the cross and blessed bread in my left hand.</t7515> <t7516>I felt a great power flow from my arm to my hand, and it did not surprise me at all to see the Count recoil in fear as we all made similar spontaneous movements.</t7516> <t7517>It is impossible for me to describe the expression of hatred and thwarted malice -the rage and demonic fury- on the Count's face.</t7517> <t7518>His pale face turned a greenish-yellow, contrasting with his blazing eyes, and the red scar on his forehead seemed to pulse like a heartbeat on his pallid skin.</t7518> <t7519>The next moment, with a serpentine dive, he slipped under Harker's arm before the blow could land, grabbed a bundle of money from the floor, and darted to the other side of the room, throwing himself out the window.</t7519> <t7520>Amid the crash and sparkle of the falling glass, he fell to the stone-paved area below.</t7520> <t7521>Amid the crash of the glass, I could hear the clinking of some of the gold coins as they hit the stone ground.</t7521> <t7522>We ran to the window and saw him spring up from the ground unscathed.</t7522> <t7523>Running, he crossed the stone-paved square, climbed the steps, and opened the stable door.</t7523> <t7524>There he turned and called out to us:</t7524>
<t7525>“You think you can stop me, you - with your pale faces lined up like sheep for the slaughter.</t7525> <t7526>But in the end, you will regret it, each one of you!</t7526> <t7527>You think you have deprived me of places where I can rest and relax; but there are others.</t7527> <t7528>My revenge is just beginning!</t7528> <t7529>I have spread it over centuries, and time is working in my favor.</t7529> <t7530>Your beloved girls are already mine, and through them, you and others will also be mine - my creatures to do my bidding and my jackals when I need to feed.</t7530> <t7531>Bah!” With a contemptuous laugh, he quickly passed through the door, and we heard the rusty bolt creak as he locked it behind him.</t7531> <t7532>A door opened and closed further ahead.</t7532> <t7533>Realizing the difficulty of following him into the stable, the Professor was the first to speak as we moved towards the hall.</t7533>
<t7534>“We learned something - actually, a lot!</t7534> <t7535>Despite his brave words, he is afraid of us; he fears time, he fears deprivation!</t7535> <t7536>If that were not the case, why would he be in such a hurry?</t7536> <t7537>His tone of voice gives him away, or my ears are deceiving me.</t7537> <t7538>Why would he take that money?</t7538> <t7539>You go after him quickly.</t7539> <t7540>You are wild animal hunters, and think of him as such.</t7540> <t7541>As for me, I will ensure that nothing here will be of use to him if he happens to return.”</t7541> <t7542>While speaking, he put the remaining money in his pocket, took the deeds in the bundle as Harker had left them, and swept the rest towards the fireplace, setting them all on fire with a match.</t7542> <t7543>Godalming and Morris ran out into the courtyard, Harker had climbed out of the window to follow the Count.</t7543> <t7544>But the Count had bolted the stable door, and when they forced it open, there was no trace of him.</t7544> <t7545>Van Helsing and I tried to search the back of the house, but the narrow streets were empty and no one had seen the Count leave.</t7545>
<t7546>It was almost evening and there was not much time left until sunset.</t7546> <t7547>We had to accept that our plan had fallen through, with sorrowful hearts, we agreed with the Professor's words: "Come, let us return to Madam Mina - poor, poor, dear Madam Mina.</t7547> <t7548>For now, everything that could be done has been done, and there, at least we can protect her.</t7548> <t7549>But we must not fall into despair.</t7549> <t7550>There is only one more box of earth left, and we must try to find it; once that is done, everything will be alright." I could see that he was speaking as bravely as he could to reassure Harker.</t7550> <t7551>Poor man, he was quite broken; from time to time, a slight groan escaped his lips that he couldn't suppress - he was thinking of his wife.</t7551>
<t7552>We returned to my home, where we saw Ms. Harker waiting for us with a cheerful appearance that honored her courage and generosity with sorrowful hearts.</t7552> <t7553>When she saw our faces, her own face turned deathly pale; for a second or two, her eyes closed as if she were secretly praying, and then she spoke with joy:</t7553>
<t7554>“No matter how much I thank you, it won't be enough.</t7554> <t7555>Ah, my poor darling!” While speaking, she took her husband's graying head in her hands and kissed it - “Rest your poor head here and relax.</t7555> <t7556>Everything will be alright, my love!</t7556> <t7557>If we wish for it with good intentions, God will protect us.”</t7557> <t7558>The poor man only groaned.</t7558> <t7559>There was no room for words in the great pain he was enduring.</t7559>
<t7560>We all had a haphazard meal together, and I think it somehow cheered us all up.</t7560> <t7561>Perhaps what helped us was the animal warmth of the meal in the eyes of hungry people—since none of us had eaten anything since breakfast—or the feeling of camaraderie; somehow, we were no longer as miserable as before and did not see tomorrow as hopeless.</t7561> <t7562>Staying true to our word, we told Ms. Mina everything that had happened, and although she paled even more at times when the danger seemed to threaten her husband and blushed at other moments when her husband's devotion to her was mentioned, she listened bravely and calmly.</t7562> <t7563>When we got to the part where Harker unhesitatingly attacked the Count, she clung to her husband's arm and held on tightly as if her grip could protect him from any danger that might come.</t7563> <t7564>But she did not say anything until the entire account was finished and the events were brought up to the present moment.</t7564> <t7565>Then, without letting go of her husband's hand, she stood up among us and spoke.</t7565> <t7566>Oh, how I wish I could convey the scene; that sweet, sweet, good, good woman standing in the radiant beauty of her youth and vitality, with the red scar on her forehead that she was aware of and that we—remembering where and how it came from—looked at with gritted teeth; her loving gentleness in the face of our relentless hatred; her compassionate faith despite all our fears and doubts; from what we could tell from the signs, all her goodness, purity, and faith were not wanted by God.</t7566>
<t7567>“Jonathan,” she said, and the word rang on her lips like music; it was so full of love and tenderness!</t7567> <t7568>“Jonathan my dear, and all of you my true, true friends, I want you to keep one thing in mind throughout all this terrible time.</t7568> <t7569>I know you have to fight - just as you destroyed the false Lucy so that the real Lucy could live forever, you must destroy this too, but this is not a task of hatred.</t7569> <t7570>The poor man who caused all this is the saddest case of all.</t7570> <t7571>Think how he will rejoice when the bad side is destroyed so that the good side can attain spiritual immortality.</t7571> <t7572>Even if this does not stop you from destroying him, approach him with pity.</t7572><t7573>”</t7573>
<t7574>While she was speaking, I could see her husband's face darken and his expression contort as if his passion had been drawn deep within him.</t7574> <t7575>Instinctively, he continued to squeeze his wife's hand until his knuckles turned white.</t7575> <t7576>His wife did not shy away from the pain, which I was sure she felt, but looked at him with eyes more alluring than ever.</t7576> <t7577>When his wife finished speaking, Harker stood up, almost tearing his hand away from hers, and said:</t7577>
<t7578>“I hope God leaves him in my hands long enough to destroy his earthly life as we intend.</t7578> <t7579>If beyond that, I could send his soul to Hell, burning in flames forever, I would do that too!</t7579><t7580>”</t7580>
<t7581>“Ah, Jesus! Ah, Jesus! For God's sake.</t7581> <t7582>Don't say such things, Jonathan, my dear husband; or you will tear me apart with fear and horror.</t7582> <t7583>My love, maybe I too...</t7583> <t7584>one day...</t7584> <t7585>might need such pity -I have been thinking about this all day long- think about it; and think that someone else like you -someone with a reason for anger equal to yours- might deprive me of it!</t7585> <t7586>Oh, my dear husband! My dear husband, if there were another way, I would save you from such a thought, but I pray to God that he does not give too much value to your wild words and sees them as the broken-hearted cry of a man who loves deeply and suffers greatly.</t7586> <t7587>Oh, my God, see these white hairs as proof of the sufferings of this man who has done no evil throughout his life and has faced many sorrows.</t7587><t7588>”</t7588>
<t7589>All of us men were now in tears.</t7589> <t7590>There was no point in resisting them, and we openly cried.</t7590> <t7591>Seeing that her sweet thoughts were effective, Ms. Harker also cried.</t7591> <t7592>Her husband threw himself on his knees beside her and, wrapping his arms around his wife, buried his face in the folds of her dress.</t7592> <t7593>Van Helsing signaled to us, and we left the room, leaving the two loving hearts alone with their God.</t7593>
<t7594>Before they went to bed, the Professor prepared their rooms against the possibility of the Vampire entering and assured Ms. Harker that she could sleep peacefully.</t7594> <t7595>She tried to accustom herself to this belief and clearly tried to appear pleased for her husband's sake.</t7595> <t7596>This was a brave struggle; I think and believe that it was not without its reward.</t7596> <t7597>Van Helsing had placed a bell within reach that either of them could ring in case of any emergency.</t7597> <t7598>When they retired to bed, Quincey, Godalming, and I decided to divide the night among ourselves, staying awake and keeping an eye on the poor distressed lady.</t7598> <t7599>The first watch falls to Quincey, so the rest of us should go to bed as early as possible.</t7599> <t7600>Godalming has already gone to bed since the second watch is his.</t7600> <t7601>Now that my work is done, I can go to bed as well.</t7601>
<t7602>Jonathan Harker's journal</t7602>
<t7603>3-4</t7603> <t7604>October, near midnight.</t7604> <t7605>- I thought yesterday would never end.</t7605> <t7606>I fell asleep with a blind belief that everything would be different when I woke up and that any change would now be for the better.</t7606> <t7607>Before parting, we discussed what our next step would be, but we couldn't reach a conclusion.</t7607> <t7608>All we knew was that there was one more of the earth boxes and only the Count knew where it was.</t7608> <t7609>If he chose to hide, he could keep us at bay for years, and in the meantime...</t7609> <t7610>The thought is so terrifying that I dare not even think of it now.</t7610> <t7611>This I know: If there is a perfectly virtuous woman, it is my poor, wronged beloved.</t7611> <t7612>Because of the sweet pity I felt last night—a pity so profound that it made even my hatred for the monster seem base—I love her a thousand times more.</t7612> <t7613>God will surely not allow the world to become more wretched by losing such a creature.</t7613> <t7614>This is my hope.</t7614> <t7615>Now we are all caught in the current, heading towards the shallow rocks, and faith is our only assurance.</t7615> <t7616>Thank God!</t7616> <t7617>Mina is sleeping and not dreaming.</t7617> <t7618>I fear what her dreams might be like, based on such terrible memories.</t7618> <t7619>From what I can see, she hasn't been very calm since sunset.</t7619> <t7620>Then, for a while, a peace settled on her face, like the calm that follows the sudden winds of March.</t7620> <t7621>At the time, I thought it was the softness of the red sunset falling on her face, but now I think it has a deeper meaning somehow.</t7621> <t7622>Despite being very exhausted—dead tired—I am not sleepy.</t7622> <t7623>But I must try to sleep because there is a tomorrow I need to think about, and there is no peace for me until then...</t7623>
<t7624>Later.</t7624> <t7625>- I must have fallen asleep, because Mina, who was sitting in the middle of the bed with a surprised expression on her face, woke me up.</t7625> <t7626>I could easily see this because I hadn't left the room dark; she put her hand to my mouth as if to warn me and whispered in my ear: "Shhh! There's someone in the corridor!" I got up slowly and, crossing the room lengthwise, gently opened the door.</t7626>
<t7627>Just outside, lying on a mattress awake, Mr. Morris was lying.</t7627> <t7628>While speaking in a whisper, he raised his hand for me to be quiet:</t7628>
<t7629>"Shh! Go back to your bed; everything is fine.</t7629> <t7630>One of us will stay here all night.</t7630> <t7631>We have no intention of leaving anything to chance!</t7631><t7632>"</t7632>
<t7633>His gaze and hand gesture left no room for argument, so I returned and told Mina what had happened.</t7633> <t7634>Mina sighed, and as she wrapped her arms around me, a shadow of a smile spread across her poor, pale face, and she said:</t7634>
<t7635>“Ah, thank God for my good, brave men!” He sighed and lay down to sleep again.</t7635> <t7636>Although I should try to sleep again, I am writing these now because I am not sleepy.</t7636>
<t7637>4</t7637> <t7638>October, morning.</t7638> <t7639>- I was woken up by Mina once again during the night.</t7639> <t7640>This time we all had a good sleep, because the approaching dawn's grayness was turning the windows into sharp rectangles, and the flame of the gas lamp resembled a speck more than a circle of light.</t7640> <t7641>She hurriedly said to me: "Go, call the Professor.</t7641> <t7642>I want to see him immediately.</t7642><t7643>"</t7643>
<t7644>“Why?” I asked.</t7644>
<t7645>"I have an idea.</t7645> <t7646>It must have come to me at night and matured without me realizing it.</t7646> <t7647>You must hypnotize me before dawn, then I can speak.</t7647> <t7648>Go quickly, my love; time is running out."</t7648> <t7649>I went to the door.</t7649> <t7650>Dr. Seward was resting on the mattress and jumped up when he saw me.</t7650>
<t7651>“Is there a problem?” he asked fearfully.</t7651>
<t7652>“No,” I replied; “but Mina wants to see Dr. Van Helsing immediately.</t7652><t7653>”</t7653>
<t7654>“I will go,” he said and ran to the Professor's room.</t7654>
<t7655>Within two or three minutes, Van Helsing was in the room with his dressing gown on; Mr. Morris and Lord Godalming were standing at the door with Dr. Seward, asking questions.</t7655> <t7656>When the Professor saw Mina smiling - a happy smile that wiped the worry off the Professor's face - the Professor rubbed his hands together and said:</t7656>
<t7657>“Ah, dear Madam Mina, this is truly a great change.</t7657> <t7658>Look, my friend Jonathan!</t7658> <t7659>Our old dear Madam Mina has returned to us today as she used to be!” Then, turning to Mina, he spoke cheerfully: “Well, what can I do for you?</t7659> <t7660>Because you wouldn't have called me at this hour for something trivial.</t7660><t7661>”</t7661>
<t7662>"I want you to hypnotize me!" she said.</t7662> <t7663>"Do it before dawn because that's when I feel I can talk, talk freely.</t7663> <t7664>Be quick because time is short!" The Professor, without saying anything, gestured for Mina to sit on the bed.</t7664>
<t7665>Fixing her eyes on him, she began to move both her hands from the top of her head down in front of Mina's face, one after the other.</t7665> <t7666>Mina stared at the Professor for a minute or two; during this time, my heart was pounding like a hammer because I felt a crisis was approaching.</t7666> <t7667>Gradually, Mina's eyes closed and she sat completely still; it was only from the slight rise and fall of her chest that one could tell she was alive.</t7667> <t7668>The Professor made a few more passes and then stopped; I could see that his forehead was covered with large beads of sweat.</t7668> <t7669>Mina opened her eyes, but she did not look like the same woman.</t7669> <t7670>There was a distant look in her eyes and a sad, sleepy tone in her voice that was new to me.</t7670> <t7671>With a gesture asking for silence, the Professor raised his hand and signaled me to bring the others inside.</t7671> <t7672>They entered on tiptoe, closing the door behind them, and stood at the foot of the bed, watching.</t7672> <t7673>Mina seemed not to have seen them.</t7673> <t7674>The silence was broken by Van Helsing speaking in a low tone so as not to disrupt Mina's train of thought:</t7674>
<t7675>“Where are you?” The answer came naturally: “I don't know.</t7675> <t7676>Sleep has no place of its own.”</t7676> <t7677>There was a few minutes of silence.</t7677> <t7678>Mina stood perfectly still and upright, and the Professor stood with his eyes fixed on her; the rest of us barely dared to breathe.</t7678> <t7679>The room was gradually getting brighter; Dr. Van Helsing, without taking his eyes off Mina's face, signaled me to lift the curtain.</t7679> <t7680>I did so, and the day appeared right above us.</t7680> <t7681>The red horizon was rising rapidly, and a pink light spread through the room.</t7681> <t7682>At that moment, the Professor spoke again: “Where are you now?” The answer came as if in a dream but consciously; it was as if something was being interpreted.</t7682> <t7683>I had heard the same tone of voice when reading notes written in shorthand.</t7683>
<t7684>“I don't know.</t7684> <t7685>They are all strangers to me!</t7685><t7686>”</t7686>
<t7687>“What do you see?</t7687><t7688>”</t7688>
<t7689>"I can't see anything; everywhere is dark."</t7689><t7690></t7690>
<t7691>"What do you hear?" I could detect the tension in the Professor's patient voice.</t7691>
<t7692>“The splashing of the water.</t7692> <t7693>The water is roaring and small waves are splashing.</t7693> <t7694>I can hear their sounds from outside.</t7694><t7695>”</t7695>
<t7696>"So you are on the ship, right?"</t7696> <t7697>We all looked at each other, trying to understand something.</t7697> <t7698>We were afraid to think.</t7698> <t7699>The answer came quickly:</t7699>
<t7700>“Ah, yes!</t7700><t7701>”</t7701>
<t7702>“What else do you hear?</t7702><t7703>”</t7703>
<t7704>“The footsteps of the men running above.</t7704> <t7705>The creak of a chain and the loud clatter as the windlass chain unwinds.</t7705><t7706>”</t7706>
<t7707>"What are you doing?</t7707><t7708>"</t7708>
<t7709>"I am not moving - oh, I am not moving at all.</t7709> <t7710>I am like a dead person!" His voice faded, turning into the deep breath of someone sleeping, and his open eyes closed again.</t7710>
<t7711>Meanwhile, the sun had risen, and we were all in the light of day.</t7711> <t7712>Dr. Van Helsing placed his hands on Mina's shoulders and gently laid her head on the pillow.</t7712> <t7713>For a few seconds, she lay there sleeping like a child, and then, with a long sigh, she woke up and looked at us standing around her with curious eyes.</t7713> <t7714>The only thing she said was, "Did I talk in my sleep?"</t7714> <t7715>But she seemed to know the situation without us explaining; however, she was eager to know what she had said.</t7715> <t7716>The professor repeated the conversation that had taken place, and Mina said:</t7716>
<t7717>"Then there is not a single second to lose; it might not be too late yet!" Mr. Morris and Lord Godalming moved towards the door, but the Professor's calm voice called them back:</t7717>
<t7718>“Wait, my friends.</t7718> <t7719>Wherever that ship is, it was setting sail while Madam Mina was speaking.</t7719> <t7720>There are many ships currently setting sail in your Great London Port.</t7720> <t7721>Which one are you looking for?</t7721> <t7722>Thank God, even though we don't know where it will take us, we have another clue once again.</t7722> <t7723>We were partly blind; blind because of people's attitudes, because if it was possible for us to have seen what we might have seen, when we look back, we see what we can see when we look forward.</t7723> <t7724>Alas! But this sentence turned out like mud; didn't it?</t7724> <t7725>Despite Jonathan's furious knife scaring him, we now know what went through the Count's mind as he grabbed that money.</t7725> <t7726>He is thinking of escaping.</t7726> <t7727>Listen to me, ESCAPING! With only one remaining soil box and a pack of men chasing him like dogs chasing a fox, he realized that this London is not a place for him.</t7727> <t7728>He loaded his last soil box onto a ship and left the country.</t7728> <t7729>He thinks of escaping, but no!</t7729> <t7730>We are going after him.</t7730> <t7731>As our friend Arthur would say when he puts on his red coat, Tally Ho! Our fox is cunning, ah! So cunning that we must also pursue him cunningly.</t7731> <t7732>I am also cunning, and I will think with his mind for a while.</t7732> <t7733>During this time, we can rest and be at peace because there are waters between us that he does not want to cross and cannot cross even if he wanted to - of course, unless the ship runs aground and this can only happen at full or slack tide.</t7733> <t7734>Look, the sun has just risen, and we have the whole day until sunset.</t7734> <t7735>Let's bathe, dress, and have the breakfast we need and can comfortably eat because it is not on the same soil as us.”</t7735> <t7736>Mina looked at him with touching eyes as she asked him a question:</t7736>
<t7737>"But if it has moved away from us, why do we need to keep searching for it?"</t7737> <t7738>The professor held his hand and gently tapped while answering his question:</t7738>
<t7739>“Don't ask me any questions for now.</t7739> <t7740>I will answer all the questions when we have breakfast.”</t7740> <t7741>He didn't say anything else and we left to get dressed.</t7741>
<t7742>After breakfast, Mina repeated her question.</t7742> <t7743>The professor looked at her seriously for a moment and then said sadly:</t7743>
<t7744>"Because, dear, dear Madam Mina, now, even if we have to follow him to the very mouth of hell, we must find him!" As she softly asked her question, Mina's face grew even paler:</t7744>
<t7745>“Why?</t7745><t7746>”</t7746>
<t7747>“Because,” replied the Professor seriously, “he can live for centuries, but you are a mortal woman.</t7747> <t7748>We must now fear time - after he left that mark on your neck.</t7748><t7749>”</t7749>
<t7750>I arrived just in time to catch Mina as she fainted and collapsed to the ground.</t7750>

<t7755>Dear Madam, you will stay by Mina's side.</t7755><t7756>We are going to conduct our research - if I can call it research, because it is not research but a state of knowing, and we are only in pursuit of proof.</t7756><t7757>But stay here today and take care of Madam Mina.</t7757><t7758>This is your best and most sacred duty.</t7758><t7759>Nothing can keep the Count here today.</t7759><t7760>Allow me to tell you the things that the other four have already learned because I told them.</t7760><t7761>Our enemy has gone far away; he has returned to his Castle in Transylvania.</t7761><t7762>I know this as well as if it were written on the wall in fire.</t7762><t7763>He prepared for this in some way, and the last soil box is waiting somewhere ready to be loaded onto a ship.</t7763><t7764>He took the money for this; he hurried the last time for this so that we would not catch him before sunset.</t7764><t7765>This was his only hope, apart from being able to hide in the grave of poor Miss Lucy, which he always thought would be open for him.</t7765><t7766>But there was no time.</t7766><t7767>When this failed, he resorted to his last chance - that is, to the last soil house, which I hope was a double entendre.</t7767><t7768>So clever, ah! So clever!</t7768><t7769>He knew his game here was over, and so he decided to return home.</t7769><t7770>He will find a ship going in the direction he came from and board it.</t7770><t7771>Now we are going to find that ship and its route; once we learn this, we will come back and tell you everything.</t7771><t7772>Then we will relieve you and poor dear Madam Mina.</t7772><t7773>Because this will give hope when you think everything is over: Not everything is lost.</t7773><t7774>It took hundreds of years for this creature we are pursuing to come to London, and yet in one day, when we learn where he has settled, we are driving him out of here.</t7774><t7775>Despite being strong enough to cause much harm and not suffering like us, his power is limited.</t7775><t7776>But each of us is strong within our purpose, and together we become even stronger.</t7776><t7777>Keep your heart at ease, dear husband of Madam Mina.</t7777><t7778>The war has now begun, and in the end, we will definitely win - as certain as God sitting high above watching his children.</t7778><t7779>So, be very at ease until we return.</t7779>

<t7803>October 5, 5 PM.</t7803> <t7804>- Minutes of our meeting.</t7804> <t7805>Attendees: Professor Van Helsing, Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, Mr. Quincey Morris, Jonathan Harker, Mina Harker.</t7805>
<t7806>Dr. Van Helsing explained the steps taken during the day to find out which ship Count Dracula boarded for his escape and what his destination was:</t7806>
<t7807>"Since I knew that he wanted to return to Transylvania, I was sure that he had to go from somewhere in the Black Sea, because he came from the mouth of the Danube or that route."</t7807> <t7808>"In front of us, there was a void that led to despair."</t7808> <t7809>"Omne ignotum pro magnifico69 and thus, we began to find the ships that set sail for the Black Sea last night with great difficulty."</t7809> <t7810>"Madam Mina mentioned that the sails were set, so he was on a sailing ship."</t7810> <t7811>"Since these were not important enough to be included in your list in The Times, upon Lord Godalming's suggestion, we went to Lloyd's office, where the records of all ships, no matter how small, were kept."</t7811> <t7812>"There, we learned that there was only one ship that set sail with the tide and headed for the Black Sea."</t7812> <t7813>"Its name was Czarina Catherine; it had set sail from Doolittle's Wharf towards Varna and from there it would make stops at other places and go up the Danube."</t7813> <t7814>"Aha!" I said, "This is the ship the Count is on."</t7814> <t7815>"Therefore, we went to Doolittle's Wharf and there, we found a man sitting in a small wooden office; the office was so small that the man seemed bigger than the office."</t7815> <t7816>"We asked him about what was happening on the Czarina Catherine."</t7816> <t7817>"He swore a lot, red-faced and loud, but still a good man; when Quincey gave him something that rustled as he took it out of his pocket and put it into a very small bag he took from the depths of his clothing, he became an even better friend and respectful servant to us."</t7817> <t7818>"He came with us and asked a lot of rough and angry men; they also became better men when their thirst was quenched."</t7818> <t7819>"They spoke a lot about blood, curses, and other things that I could guess the meaning of but did not fully understand; still, they told us everything we wanted to know."</t7819>
<t7820>Among these, they tell us how a man came rushing in around five o'clock yesterday afternoon.</t7820><t7821>A tall, thin, and pale man with an aquiline nose, very white teeth, and eyes that seemed to be burning like flames.</t7821><t7822>He was dressed entirely in black, except for a straw hat that suited neither him nor the time.</t7822><t7823>He spent his money to inquire about which ship was setting sail for the Black Sea and where it was going.</t7823><t7824>Someone took him to the office and then to the ship; he did not board the ship and stood on the dock, asking for the captain to come to him.</t7824><t7825>When told he would be well paid, the captain came; though he cursed a lot at first, he accepted the deal, and then the thin man left, asking someone where he could rent a horse and carriage.</t7825><t7826>The man went there; shortly after, he returned driving a carriage with a large box on it; although many people were needed to load the box onto the ship, he unloaded it from the carriage himself.</t7826><t7827>He had a long conversation with the captain about how and where the box should be placed; but the captain did not like this and cursed at him in many languages, telling him to come and deal with it himself if he wanted.</t7827><t7828>But he said, "No," stating that he had much to do and would not come yet.</t7828><t7829>Upon this, the captain told him to hurry because his -damned- ship would leave before the tide changed -damned-.</t7829><t7830>Then, the thin man laughed and said that of course the captain should leave whenever he thought appropriate, but if he left too quickly, he might encounter a surprise.</t7830><t7831>While the captain cursed again in many languages, the thin man nodded, thanked him, and said he would board the ship before it set sail to take advantage of its hospitality and courtesy to some extent.</t7831><t7832>Finally, the captain, angrier than ever and in even more languages, said he did not want any damned Frenchman on his damned ship.</t7832><t7833>Upon this, the man asked if there was a shop nearby where he could get loading forms and then left.</t7833>
<t7834>Nobody knew where they were going or, as they said, because they had other damn things to think about - because it soon became clear that the Czarina Catherine was not going to set sail as expected.</t7834><t7835>A thin mist had silently drifted from the river and grown, grown; until a thick layer of fog enveloped the ship and everything around it.</t7835><t7836>The captain cursed in many languages - many, many languages - cursed in many languages, but could do nothing.</t7836><t7837>As the water continued to rise, the captain began to fear losing the tide altogether.</t7837><t7838>He was in no friendly mood when, as the sea rose completely, the frail man came back to the dock and wanted to see where his chest was stowed.</t7838><t7839>Then the captain responded by saying he wished both he and his chest would go to Hell - damn it.</t7839><t7840>But the frail man did not trust him and went down with the first mate to see where the chest was placed, then came back up and stood on the deck for a while, in the fog.</t7840><t7841>He must have come there on his own, because no one noticed him.</t7841><t7842>In fact, they did not think about him, because after a while the fog began to melt away and everything became clear again.</t7842><t7843>My thirsty friends laughed as they recounted how the captain's curses, exceeding his usual multilingualism, and his colorful display when he asked other sailors moving on the river at the time and found that very few had seen the fog, and those who had only seen it around the dock.</t7843><t7844>Still, the ship had set off before the waters receded and had undoubtedly reached the mouth of the river by morning.</t7844><t7845>By that time, they must have set sail as they spoke with us.</t7845>
<t7846>And so, dear Madam Mina, we must rest for a while because our enemy, with the mist at his command, is at the mouth of the Danube, at sea.</t7846> <t7847>Sailing takes time; it never goes very fast; when we set out, we will travel faster on land and meet him there.</t7847> <t7848>Our best hope is to encounter him in his box between sunrise and sunset, for then he cannot fight, and we can deal with him as we must.</t7848> <t7849>We have days to prepare our plan.</t7849> <t7850>We know everything about where he is going because we saw the ship's owner, who showed us the invoices and all possible documents.</t7850> <t7851>The box we are looking for will be unloaded at Varna and handed over to an agent named Ristics, who will present the necessary authority and identification; thus, our merchant friend will have done his part.</t7851> <t7852>When asked if there is any problem, we will say, 'No,' because what needs to be done is not the work of the police or customs officers.</t7852> <t7853>It must be done solely by us and in our own way.</t7853><t7854>”</t7854>
<t7855>When Dr. Van Helsing finished speaking, I asked if it was certain that the Count remained on the ship.</t7855> <t7856>He replied: "We have the best evidence for that; your testimony during this morning's hypnosis."</t7856> <t7857>I asked him again if it was really necessary for them to pursue the Count; because I am very afraid that Jonathan will leave me, and if the others go, I know he will undoubtedly go as well.</t7857> <t7858>At first, he answered quietly, then with growing passion.</t7858> <t7859>But as he continued speaking, he became more and more angry and furious; in the end, we had to witness at least a part of the personal dominance that allowed him to command people for so long: "Yes, it is necessary - necessary - necessary!</t7859> <t7860>First for your well-being, and then for the well-being of humanity.</t7860> <t7861>This monster has already caused much harm, even as a mere being acting ignorantly in the dark within the narrow confines and short time he found himself.</t7861> <t7862>I have told all this to the others; you, dear Madam Mina, will learn from the phonograph of my friend John or your husband.</t7862> <t7863>I told them how it took centuries of work for him to leave his desolate lands - his desolate lands devoid of humans - and come to a new country where human life is as abundant as a cornfield.</t7863> <t7864>If another of the Undead like him tried to do what he did, perhaps all the centuries lived or to be lived in the world could not help him.</t7864> <t7865>Alongside him, all the mysterious, deep, and powerful forces of nature must have worked together in a remarkable way.</t7865> <t7866>The place where he lived as the Undead for all these centuries is itself full of various geological and chemical oddities.</t7866> <t7867>There are deep caves and cracks whose ends are unknown.</t7867> <t7868>There are volcanoes that still emit waters with strange properties, gases that kill or give life from their mouths.</t7868> <t7869>Undoubtedly, there is something attractive or exciting in some of these mysterious forces that work strangely for physical life; the Count himself had some great qualities from the beginning.</t7869> <t7870>He is praised for having nerves of steel, a more cunning mind, and a braver heart compared to everyone else in a time of hardship and war.</t7870> <t7871>Some essential principles reach their highest level in him in a strange way, and while his body remains strong and matures, his mind also matures in the same way.</t7871> <t7872>All this, of course, happens without any demonic assistance related to him, because he must surrender to the forces that come from goodness and symbolize goodness.</t7872> <t7873>And now, for us, he is this.</t7873> <t7874>He infected you - oh, forgive me, my dear, I must say this; but I speak for your well-being.</t7874> <t7875>He infected you with such wisdom that it is enough for you to live without him doing more - to live your old, sweet life and thus, in time, death, which is the common fate of humanity and the mandate of God, will make you resemble him.</t7875> <t7876>This must not happen!</t7876> <t7877>We have sworn together that it will not happen.</t7877> <t7878>Thus, we are the messengers of God's will: The world and the people for whom God's Son died will not be left to monsters who blaspheme God with their existence.</t7878> <t7879>So far, He has allowed us to save one soul, and we go out like the Crusader knights of old to save more.</t7879> <t7880>Like them, we will journey towards the sunrise, and like them, if we die, we will have died for a good cause.</t7880><t7881>"</t7881>
<t7882>When he stopped, I said:</t7882>
<t7883>“Won't Ama Kont wisely accept his failure?</t7883> <t7884>Since he was expelled from England, like a tiger avoiding the village it was chased from, won't he avoid this place too?</t7884><t7885>”</t7885>
<t7886>“Aha!” said the Professor.</t7886><t7887>“Your tiger analogy is good for me, and I will apply it to him.</t7887><t7888>In India, once a tiger has tasted human blood, it is given a name; your man-eater no longer cares for other prey; it roams around ceaselessly until it is caught.</t7888><t7889>The one we chased from our village is also a tiger, a man-eater, and it will never stop roaming around.</t7889><t7890>Moreover, it is not one to retreat and withdraw.</t7890><t7891>In its life, in its living life, it went to the Turkish border and attacked the enemy on their own land; was it defeated but did it retreat?</t7891><t7892>No! It comes again, and again and again.</t7892><t7893>Look at its persistence and endurance.</t7893><t7894>With a child's mind, long ago, it conceived the idea of coming to the big city.</t7894><t7895>What does it do?</t7895><t7896>It finds the place on earth that promises the most for it.</t7896><t7897>Then it willingly sets about preparing for this task.</t7897><t7898>Patiently, it discovers its own strength, what its powers are.</t7898><t7899>It studies new languages.</t7899><t7900>It learns a new social life, a new environment based on old methods, the politics, law, economy, science, and habits of a new country and the new people formed during its lifetime.</t7900><t7901>A glance here only whetted its appetite and intensified its desire.</t7901><t7902>Moreover, it allows it to grow mentally; because all this confirms how right it was in its initial predictions.</t7902><t7903>It does this alone; all alone!</t7903><t7904>From a dilapidated grave in a forgotten country.</t7904><t7905>What more could it do when a greater world of thought opens up to it!</t7905><t7906>Flourishing amidst diseases that kill all humans, as far as we know, it can laugh at death.</t7906><t7907>Ah! If such a one came from God instead of the devil, what a benevolent force it would be in our old world!</t7907><t7908>But we have vowed to set the world free.</t7908><t7909>We must work silently and continue all our efforts in secrecy; because in this enlightened age, where people do not believe even what they see, the doubts of wise men become its greatest strength.</t7909><t7910>This doubt becomes its sheath, its armor, and its weapon to destroy us, its enemies, who are willing to risk even our souls for the sake of someone we love—for the good of humanity, for the honor and glory of God.</t7910><t7911>”</t7911>
<t7912>After a general discussion, we decided that nothing could be definitively determined for tonight, that we should all sleep on the facts and try to come up with appropriate conclusions.</t7912> <t7913>Tomorrow, we will meet again at breakfast and, after sharing the conclusions we have reached, we will decide on a definitive action plan.</t7913>
<t7914>Tonight, I feel a perfect sense of tranquility and peace.</t7914> <t7915>It's as if a presence that was disturbing me has moved away.</t7915> <t7916>Maybe...</t7916>
<t7917>My doubts did not end, they could not end; because in the reflection in the mirror, the red mark on my forehead caught my eye; I still knew that I was a sinner.</t7917>
<t7918>Dr. Seward's journal</t7918>
<t7919>October 5.</t7919> <t7920>- We all woke up early, and I think the sleep did us all a lot of good.</t7920> <t7921>When we met for breakfast early in the morning, there was a general cheerfulness about us that none of us hoped to experience again.</t7921>
<t7922>The resilience of human nature is truly remarkable.</t7922> <t7923>No matter what, when the hindering cause is removed in any way - even by death - we quickly return to our principles of hope and joy.</t7923> <t7924>As I sat around the table, my eyes repeatedly opened in astonishment, wondering if those last days had been a dream.</t7924> <t7925>Only when I saw the red mark on Ms. Harker's forehead did I return to reality.</t7925> <t7926>Even now, as I consider the matter seriously, it seems almost impossible to think that the source of all our troubles still exists.</t7926> <t7927>Even Ms. Harker seems to forget her troubles during all this time; only occasionally, when something reminds her, does she think of the terrible scar.</t7927> <t7928>We will meet here in my study in half an hour and decide on our plan of action.</t7928> <t7929>For now, I see only one difficulty, which I know instinctively rather than through reasoning: We all have to speak openly; but I still fear in some mysterious way that poor Ms. Harker's tongue will be tied.</t7929> <t7930>I know she has reached her own conclusions, and in light of all that has happened, I can predict how clever and accurate they will be, but she will not, cannot, express them.</t7930> <t7931>I mentioned this to Van Helsing, and when we are alone, we will discuss this matter.</t7931> <t7932>I believe this is the effect of that terrible poison entering her body.</t7932> <t7933>The Count had his own reasons for applying what Van Helsing calls the "Vampire's baptism of blood" on her.</t7933> <t7934>Well, there may be a poison that drips through the good things; in an age where the existence of ptomaines70 is a mystery, we should be surprised by nothing!</t7934> <t7935>One thing I know: If my instinct about Ms. Harker's silences is correct, it means we are facing a terrible difficulty - an unknown danger.</t7935> <t7936>The same force that compels her to silence may also compel her to speak.</t7936> <t7937>I dare not think further because in doing so, I will have stained a noble woman in my thoughts!</t7937>
<t7938>Van Helsing arrives in my study a little earlier than the others.</t7938> <t7939>I will try to bring up the subject with him.</t7939>
<t7940>Later.</t7940> <t7941>- When the professor came in, we discussed the situation.</t7941> <t7942>I could see that he had something on his mind that he wanted to say, but he was hesitant to bring it up.</t7942> <t7943>After beating around the bush for a while, he suddenly said:</t7943>
<t7944>"My friend John, there is something you and I need to discuss alone.</t7944> <t7945>Later, we might have to share our secret with the others," he paused after saying this; I waited; he continued speaking:</t7945>
<t7946>"Madam Mina, our poor dear Madam Mina is changing."</t7946> <t7947>A cold shiver ran through me as my greatest fear was thus confirmed.</t7947> <t7948>Van Helsing continued speaking:</t7948>
<t7949>"After the distressing experience we had with Miss Lucy, we must be on guard before things go too far."</t7949> <t7950>"Our task is now actually more difficult than ever, and this new trouble makes every passing hour extremely important."</t7950> <t7951>"I can see the vampire-like features settling on Madam Mina's face."</t7951> <t7952>"For now, they are very, very faint; if we look with unbiased eyes, they can be seen."</t7952> <t7953>"Her teeth have sharpened and, from time to time, her eyes harden."</t7953> <t7954>"But that's not all, the silence around her is becoming more frequent; it was the same with Miss Lucy."</t7954> <t7955>"Even when she was writing down the things she wanted to be known later, she was not speaking."</t7955> <t7956>"Now my fear is this: If by hypnotizing her, she can recount the things the Count saw and heard, then wouldn't it be even more real that the Count, who first hypnotized her and drank her blood while making her drink his, could, if he wishes, force Madam Mina's mind to show him what she knows?"</t7956> <t7957>Nodding my head in agreement with what he said, the Professor continued his words:</t7957>
<t7958>"Then, what we need to do is to prevent this; we must keep our purpose hidden from him, and thus he cannot explain what he does not know.</t7958> <t7959>This is a painful task! Ah! So painful that even thinking about it breaks my heart, but it must be so.</t7959> <t7960>When we meet today, I must tell him that for a reason we cannot explain, he will no longer be able to attend our meetings, and will only be protected by us."</t7960> <t7961>The professor wiped his forehead, which was already sweating at the thought of the pain he would cause the poor soul who was already suffering greatly.</t7961> <t7962>If I were to tell him that I had reached the same conclusion, I knew it would be a kind of solace for him because at least it would eliminate the pain of doubt.</t7962> <t7963>I told him this, and it had the expected effect.</t7963>
<t7964>We are close to all coming together.</t7964> <t7965>Van Helsing went out to prepare for the meeting and the painful task that fell to him.</t7965> <t7966>In fact, I believe his purpose was to be able to pray alone.</t7966>
<t7967>Later.</t7967> <t7968>- At the beginning of our meeting, both Van Helsing and I felt very relieved.</t7968> <t7969>Ms. Harker, through her husband, conveyed a message saying that she would not be able to join us now, as she thought it would be more appropriate for us to discuss our actions freely without her presence causing any inconvenience.</t7969> <t7970>The Professor and I exchanged a glance for a moment and both of us felt relieved.</t7970> <t7971>As for me, I thought that if Ms. Harker had become aware of the danger, the pain would have shifted direction as much as the danger itself.</t7971> <t7972>Under these circumstances, with questioning and answering glances and a finger brought to the lips, we agreed once again to remain silent about our suspicions until we could meet alone.</t7972> <t7973>We immediately set about our plan of action.</t7973> <t7974>First, Van Helsing roughly laid out the facts before us:</t7974>
<t7975>“Czarina Catherine left the Thames yesterday morning.</t7975> <t7976>It will take at least three weeks for it to reach Varna at its fastest speed, but we can reach the same place by land in three days.</t7976> <t7977>Now, if we consider that the Count can influence the weather, as we know he can, shortening the ship's journey by two days, and if we allow a full day and night for any delays that might occur, we still have a gap of about two weeks.</t7977> <t7978>Therefore, to be absolutely safe, we must leave here by the 17th at the latest.</t7978> <t7979>Then, in any case, we can be in Varna a day before the ship arrives and make the necessary preparations.</t7979> <t7980>Of course, we must go armed - we must be armed against both spiritual and physical evils.” Here Quincey added:</t7980>
<t7981>“As far as I understand, the Count comes from the land of wolves, and it is likely that he will arrive there before us.</t7981> <t7982>I suggest we add Winchester rifles to the weapons we are taking with us.</t7982> <t7983>I have a belief in relying on the Winchester when there are such problems around.</t7983> <t7984>Do you remember the time when a pack of wolves followed us in Tobolsk, Art? What wouldn't we have given for automatic weapons then!” “Good!” said Van Helsing, “Let it be Winchesters.</t7984> <t7985>Quincey always knows what to do, especially when it comes to hunting; but the damage my metaphor does to science is greater than what wolves would do to humans.</t7985> <t7986>Meanwhile, there is nothing we can do here, and considering that none of us know Varna, why don't we leave earlier?</t7986> <t7987>Waiting here is as long as waiting there.</t7987> <t7988>We can prepare tonight and tomorrow, and then, if everything goes well, the four of us can set off.”</t7988> <t7989>“The four of us?” asked Harker, looking at each of us one by one.</t7989>
<t7990>“Of course!” replied the Professor quickly.</t7990> <t7991>“You must stay to take care of your very sweet wife!” Harker remained silent for a while and then said in a dull voice:</t7991>
<t7992>“Let's talk about that part in the morning.</t7992> <t7993>I want to consult Mina.”</t7993> <t7994>I thought the time had come for Van Helsing to warn Mina not to reveal our plans, but he didn't consider it at all.</t7994> <t7995>I looked at him meaningfully and coughed.</t7995> <t7996>In response, he put his finger to his lips and turned away.</t7996>
<t7997>Jonathan Harker's journal</t7997>
<t7998>October 5, afternoon.</t7998> <t7999>- After our meeting this morning, I couldn't think for a while.</t7999> <t8000>The new stages the work had reached had piqued my curiosity in such a way that there was no room left in my mind for active thoughts.</t8000> <t8001>Mina's determination not to participate in the meeting had made me ponder, and since I couldn't discuss this with her, I could only speculate.</t8001> <t8002>At this moment, I am further from reaching a conclusion than ever before.</t8002> <t8003>The way the others reacted to this also confused me; the last time we talked about this, we had agreed that there would be no more secrets among us.</t8003> <t8004>Mina is now sleeping beautifully and sweetly like a child.</t8004> <t8005>Her lips are curved, and her face is glowing with happiness.</t8005> <t8006>Thank God, she can still have such moments.</t8006>
<t8007>Later.</t8007> <t8008>- How strange all this is! I was sitting and watching Mina's peaceful sleep, and I felt as happy as I thought I could never be again.</t8008> <t8009>As evening fell and the earth took its shadows from the setting sun, the silence of the room began to feel increasingly sacred to me.</t8009> <t8010>Suddenly, Mina opened her eyes and softly said to me:</t8010>
<t8011>“Jonathan, I want you to give me your word of honor on something.</t8011> <t8012>A promise you will make to me, but since it is made in the presence of God, it will be considered sacred and will not be broken even if I fall to my knees and beg you with tearful eyes.</t8012> <t8013>Quick, you must promise me immediately.</t8013><t8014>”</t8014>
<t8015>“Mina,” I said, “I cannot give such a promise immediately.</t8015> <t8016>I may not have the right to do this.</t8016><t8017>”</t8017>
<t8018>“But my love,” he said with a spiritual intensity that made his eyes shine like the North Star, “I am the one who wants this and I do not want it for myself.</t8018> <t8019>If I am wrong, you can ask Dr. Van Helsing; if he does not agree with you, you can do as you wish.</t8019> <t8020>Moreover, if you accept this, you will be forgiven for your word in the future.</t8020><t8021>”</t8021>
<t8022>“I promise!” I said, and for a moment he looked incredibly happy; yet in my opinion, all his happiness was hindered by the red scar on his forehead.</t8022> <t8023>He spoke thus:</t8023>
<t8024>“Promise me that you will not tell me anything about the plans for the war against Kont.”</t8024> <t8025>“Not a word, not an inference, not even a hint; as long as this is on me, never!” And as he said this, he seriously pointed to the scar on his forehead.</t8025> <t8026>I saw that he was sincere and I said seriously:</t8026>
<t8027>"I promise!" And the moment I said it, I felt as if a door had closed between us.</t8027>
<t8028>Later, at midnight.</t8028> <t8029>- Mina was lively and cheerful all evening.</t8029> <t8030>So much so that, as if her cheerfulness was contagious, the rest of the team seemed to take courage from it; as a result, even I felt as if the blanket of gloom that had settled over us had somehow lifted.</t8030> <t8031>We all retired to our beds early.</t8031> <t8032>Mina is now sleeping like a child; it is a wonderful thing that her ability to sleep is not disrupted amidst her terrible distress.</t8032> <t8033>Thank God for that, because then at least she can forget her sorrow.</t8033> <t8034>Maybe just as her cheerfulness affected me tonight, this situation can also be an example.</t8034> <t8035>I will try this.</t8035> <t8036>Ah! A dreamless sleep!</t8036>
<t8037>October 6, morning.</t8037> <t8038>- A new surprise.</t8038> <t8039>Mina woke me up early, at roughly the same time as yesterday, and asked me to bring Dr. Van Helsing.</t8039> <t8040>I thought it was time for another hypnosis session and went to the Professor without asking any questions.</t8040> <t8041>Clearly, he was expecting such a call, because I found him in his room, already dressed.</t8041> <t8042>His door was ajar, so he could hear our room's door opening.</t8042> <t8043>He came immediately; as he entered the room, he asked Mina if the others could come as well.</t8043>
<t8044>"No," Mina said briefly, "that won't be necessary.</t8044> <t8045>You can tell them if you want.</t8045> <t8046>I need to be with you on your journey.</t8046><t8047>"</t8047>
<t8048>Dr. Van Helsing was as surprised as I was.</t8048> <t8049>After a moment's hesitation, he asked:</t8049>
<t8050>“But why?</t8050><t8051>”</t8051>
<t8052>"You must take me with you.</t8052> <t8053>I am safer with you, and you will be safer too.</t8053><t8054>"</t8054>
<t8055>“But why, dear Madam Mina? You know that your safety is our most serious duty.</t8055> <t8056>We are going into such a danger that, due to the circumstances, you are or may be more exposed to danger than any of us.”</t8056> <t8057>He fell silent, ashamed.</t8057>
<t8058>While responding, Mina raised her finger and pointed to her forehead:</t8058>
<t8059>“I know.</t8059> <t8060>That is why I must go.</t8060> <t8061>I can tell you now, while the sun is rising; I may not be able to tell you again.</t8061> <t8062>I know that when the Count calls me, I must go.</t8062> <t8063>If he wants me to come secretly, I know I must go by deceit; I can even deceive Jonathan in this matter.”</t8063> <t8064>The look he gave me while speaking was seen by God, and if there truly is a Recording Angel, that look has been recorded for the honor of living forever.</t8064> <t8065>I could only hold his hand.</t8065> <t8066>I could not speak; my emotions were too intense to be relieved by tears.</t8066> <t8067>He continued his words:</t8067>
<t8068>"You men are brave and strong.</t8068> <t8069>You are strong in numbers; because you can stand against someone who could break the human endurance of someone who has to protect themselves.</t8069> <t8070>Also, I might be useful, as you can hypnotize me and thus learn things that even I don't know about myself." Dr. Van Helsing said with great seriousness: "Madam Mina, as always, you are very wise.</t8070> <t8071>You will come with us and we will do together what we set out to accomplish."</t8071> <t8072>When the professor said these things</t8072>
<t8073>Mina's long silence made me look at her.</t8073> <t8074>She had fallen asleep and slumped onto her pillow; even when I opened the curtain to let the daylight flood into the room, she did not wake up.</t8074> <t8075>Van Helsing silently gestured for me to follow him.</t8075> <t8076>We went to his room, and within a minute, Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, and Mr. Morris joined us.</t8076> <t8077>The professor told them what Mina had said and continued his words:</t8077>
<t8078>“We will set out for Varna in the morning.</t8078> <t8079>We now have another matter to deal with: Madam Mina.</t8079> <t8080>Ah, but her soul is honest.</t8080> <t8081>It is painful for her to tell us these things; but we were warned very accurately and timely.</t8081> <t8082>No chance should be lost, and we must be ready to act as soon as that ship arrives in Varna.</t8082><t8083>”</t8083>
<t8084>"What exactly are we going to do?" Mr. Morris asked succinctly.</t8084> <t8085>The professor paused before responding:</t8085>
<t8086>“First, we will board the ship; then, when we locate the chest, we will place a bunch of wild roses on it.</t8086> <t8087>We will tie this bunch because as long as it is there, no one can get out of the chest; at least, that's what superstitions say.</t8087> <t8088>And first, we must trust in superstitions; in the past, this was people's belief and the root of this belief still remains.</t8088> <t8089>Then, when we seize the opportunity we are looking for, when there is no one nearby to see, we will open the chest and - and everything will be alright.</t8089><t8090>”</t8090>
<t8091>“I will not wait for an opportunity,” said Morris.</t8091> <t8092>“Even if there are a thousand men watching me and they are about to kill me at that moment, I will open the chest when I see it and destroy the monster!” Instinctively, I grabbed his hand and realized it was as hard as steel.</t8092> <t8093>I think he understood my look; I hope so.</t8093>
<t8094>“Good boy,” said Van Helsing.</t8094> <t8095>“Brave boy.</t8095> <t8096>Quincey, a true man, God bless him for that.</t8096> <t8097>My child, believe me, none of us will stand back or hesitate out of fear.</t8097> <t8098>I am saying what we can do - what we must do.</t8098> <t8099>But truly, truly, we cannot predict what we will do.</t8099> <t8100>So many things can happen and their ways and ends are so different that we cannot say anything until the moment comes.</t8100> <t8101>We will all arm ourselves in every way and when the time comes for the end, our effort will not be lacking.</t8101> <t8102>Now, let us put all our affairs in order today.</t8102> <t8103>Let everything that touches our loved ones and those who depend on us be completed, because none of us can say what, when, or how the end will be.</t8103> <t8104>I have arranged my personal affairs and since I have no other tasks to do, I will go and make the travel arrangements.</t8104> <t8105>I will get the things needed for our journey, like tickets and such.</t8105><t8106>”</t8106>
<t8107>There was nothing else to say, and so we parted ways.</t8107> <t8108>Now I will put all my worldly affairs in order and prepare for whatever is to come...</t8108>
<t8109>Later on.</t8109> <t8110>- Everything is complete; my will has been prepared and everything is finalized.</t8110> <t8111>If she survives, Mina is my sole heir.</t8111> <t8112>If she does not survive, the others who have treated us well will receive the remainder.</t8112>
<t8113>Sunset is now approaching; Mina's restlessness catches my attention.</t8113> <t8114>I have no doubt that there is something on her mind that will emerge precisely at sunset.</t8114> <t8115>Times like these are always painful moments for all of us, because every sunrise and sunset brings a new danger - even if it is for a good outcome by God's will, it brings new pain.</t8115> <t8116>I am writing these in the journal because my beloved should not hear them now; but if she can see them again, they will be ready.</t8116>
<t8117>Mina is calling me.</t8117>
<t8118>XXV</t8118>
<t8119>Dr. Seward's journal</t8119>
<t8120>October 11, evening.</t8120> <t8121>- Jonathan Harker asked me to write these down because, according to him, he was not quite adequate for this task and he wants the events to be recorded accurately.</t8121>
<t8122>I suppose none of us were surprised when we were asked to see Ms. Harker shortly before sunset.</t8122> <t8123>Recently, we had begun to understand that sunrise and sunset were her privileged hours of freedom; these were the times when her old self could emerge without any controlling force pressing, restraining, or provoking her to act.</t8123> <t8124>This mood or state begins about half an hour or a little more before the exact moment of sunrise or sunset, or it lasts until the sun has fully risen or until the minutes when the clouds are still painted red by the sun's rays hovering above the horizon.</t8124> <t8125>At first, a kind of restlessness appears as if a bond has been loosened, and this is quickly followed by absolute freedom; but when the freedom starts to fade, a rapid return or deterioration occurs swiftly after only a brief silence that serves as a warning.</t8125>
<t8126>This evening, when we came together, she was a bit troubled and bore all the signs of an internal struggle.</t8126> <t8127>I concluded that she had exerted a more strenuous effort than she had in the earliest stages to be able to do this.</t8127> <t8128>But within just a few minutes, she managed to completely control herself; then, she indicated for her husband to come and sit beside her on the couch where she was leaning back slightly, and for the rest of us to pull our chairs closer.</t8128> <t8129>Taking her husband's hand in hers, she began to speak:</t8129>
<t8130>“Perhaps for the last time, we are all sitting here freely!</t8130> <t8131>I know, my love; I know you will be by my side until the end.”</t8131> <t8132>These words were to her husband, who was holding her hand tightly as far as we could see.</t8132> <t8133>“We start work in the morning, and only God knows what awaits us.</t8133> <t8134>By taking me with you, you will treat me very well.</t8134> <t8135>I know you will do everything you can for a poor, weak woman - no, no, no, not yet, but still in danger - that all these brave, willing men can do.</t8135> <t8136>But you must not forget that I am not like you.</t8136> <t8137>There is a poison in my blood, in my soul that can destroy me; if we cannot find the cure, it must be destroyed.</t8137> <t8138>Oh, my friends!</t8138> <t8139>You know as well as I do that my soul is in danger, and even though I know there is only one salvation for me, you and I must not choose that path!” She looked at each of us one by one, starting and ending with her husband, in a way that moved us all.</t8139>
<t8140>“What is that path?” asked Van Helsing in a hoarse voice.</t8140> <t8141>“The path we must not - cannot - choose, what is it?</t8141><t8142>”</t8142>
<t8143>“Before a greater evil fully takes shape, I would rather die right now by my own hand or another's.</t8143> <t8144>You and I both know that once I am dead, you can, and will, free my immortal soul just as you did for my poor Lucy.</t8144> <t8145>If the only obstacle in my path were death or the fear of death, I would not hesitate to die here among friends who love me.</t8145> <t8146>But it is not all limited to death.</t8146> <t8147>I cannot believe that in a situation where we have hope and work to do ahead of us, dying would be God's will.</t8147> <t8148>Therefore, for my part, I am foregoing the undeniable reality of eternal peace here and stepping into the darkness where things that could never exist in this world or in Hell reside!”</t8148> <t8149>We all remained silent, instinctively knowing that this was only the introduction to her speech.</t8149> <t8150>The others' faces had turned stone-like, and Harker's complexion was ashen; perhaps he anticipated what was to come better than any of us.</t8150> <t8151>Ms. Harker continued her speech:</t8151>
<t8152>“This is the contribution I can make to the inheritance sharing.”</t8152> <t8153>I couldn't help but notice her use of this interesting legal term with all seriousness in such a place.</t8153> <t8154>“So, what will you give?</t8154> <t8155>Yes, I know your lives,” she said and quickly continued, “this is an easy thing for brave men.</t8155> <t8156>Your lives belong to God, and you can give them back to Him; but what will you give me?” She looked again with questioning eyes, but this time avoided her husband's face.</t8156> <t8157>Quincey seemed to understand; he nodded, and Ms. Harker's face lit up with joy.</t8157> <t8158>“Then, let me briefly tell you what I want, because there should be no doubtful matter in this bond between us anymore.</t8158> <t8159>Each of you -even you, my dear husband- must promise to kill me when the time comes.</t8159><t8160>”</t8160>
<t8161>"What is it then?"</t8161> <t8162>The voice belonged to Quincey, but it was a weak and tense voice.</t8162>
<t8163>“When you believe that I have changed so much that it would be better for me to die than to live.</t8163> <t8164>Thus, when I die physically, without losing a moment, you will drive a stake through my body and cut off my head, or do whatever else needs to be done to put me at peace!</t8164><t8165>”</t8165>
<t8166>The first person to stand up after the silence was Quincey.</t8166>
<t8167>He knelt before Ms. Harker and, holding her hand, began to speak solemnly:</t8167>
<t8168>“I may be a crude man who has not lived in a way to deserve such a privilege, but I swear upon everything I hold sacred and love that when the time comes, I will not shy away from the duty you have given us.</t8168> <t8169>Furthermore, I promise that if I have doubts about the right time, I will strive until I am certain!</t8169><t8170>”</t8170>
<t8171>"My true friend!" This was all Ms. Harker could say through the tears streaming from her eyes, as she bent down and kissed Quincey's hand.</t8171>
<t8172>“I swear the same, dear Madam Mina!” said Van Helsing.</t8172>
<t8173>"And me too!" said Lord Godalming; each one of them took turns kneeling in front of Ms. Harker and swore an oath.</t8173> <t8174>I followed after them.</t8174> <t8175>Then her husband turned to her and, with a face as pale as death, softened by his snow-white hair, asked:</t8175>
<t8176>“Should I also take such an oath, oh my dear wife?</t8176><t8177>”</t8177>
<t8178>“You too, my love,” he said, with a voice and eyes filled with an infinite desire for compassion.</t8178> <t8179>“You should not hesitate about this.</t8179> <t8180>You are the closest to me, the most valuable person for me, and you are worth more than the world to me; our souls are intertwined both throughout our entire lives and forever.</t8180> <t8181>Think, my love, there were times when brave men killed their wives and all the women in their lineage to prevent them from falling into the hands of the enemy.</t8181> <t8182>Their hands did not tremble because their loved ones were begging them to kill them.</t8182> <t8183>In times of painful trials, it is the duty of men towards their loved ones!</t8183> <t8184>Oh my love, if I must die by someone's hand, let it be by the hand of the one who loves me the most.</t8184> <t8185>Dr. Van Helsing, in the case of poor Lucy, it was the one who loved her the most,” -here he paused, blushing, and continued by correcting his words- “the one who most deserved the peace of mind for showing mercy.</t8185> <t8186>If such a time comes again, I trust you to turn this situation in my husband's life into a happy memory that it was his own hand that saved me from the terrible slavery I was under.</t8186><t8187>”</t8187>
<t8188>"I promise once again!" echoed the Professor's ringing voice.</t8188> <t8189>Ms. Harker, with a sigh of relief, leaned back and smiled happily as she said:</t8189>
<t8190>“And now a warning; a warning you must never forget: If it comes, this time can come quickly and unexpectedly, and in such a situation, you must not waste any time in seizing the opportunity that comes your way.</t8190> <t8191>At such a time, I might unite with your enemy against you - No! If such a time comes, I will unite with him against you.</t8191><t8192>”</t8192>
<t8193>"I have one more request," he said very seriously, "It's not as vital and necessary as the other one, but if you wish, I would like you to do one more thing for me."</t8193> <t8194>We all agreed, but no one spoke; there was no need to talk:</t8194>
<t8195>"I want you to read the prayer that was read at the funeral."</t8195> <t8196>Her words were interrupted by her husband's deep sigh; she took her husband's hand in hers, brought it to her heart, and continued: "You will read it to me one day.</t8196> <t8197>No matter how this horrifying situation ends, this prayer will be a sweet thought for all of us - or some of us.</t8197> <t8198>I hope you read it, my love, because no matter what, it will forever be etched in my memory with your voice.</t8198><t8199>"</t8199>
<t8200>"But ah, my love," her husband pleaded, "death is far away from you.</t8200><t8201>"</t8201>
<t8202>“No!” said Ms. Harker, raising her hand in warning.</t8202> <t8203>“Right now, I feel even more engulfed by death than if I were under the weight of a grave filled with earth!</t8203><t8204>”</t8204>
<t8205>"Ah! My dear wife! Do I have to read it?" said Harker before starting.</t8205>
<t8206>The only words Ms. Harker said were, "This will comfort me, my dear husband!" and when she brought the book, Harker began to read.</t8206>
<t8207>How can I or anyone else describe this strange scene, its seriousness, its distress, its sorrow, its horror, and yet its sweetness!</t8207> <t8208>Even a skeptic who sees nothing but the ridicule of the bitter truth in anything sacred or emotional would be moved by witnessing the small group of dear, loyal friends gathered around that suffering and sorrowful lady, or by hearing the simple yet beautiful prayer read during the burial, with a voice cracking from the intensity of emotion that often required pauses.</t8208> <t8209>"I-I can't go on - the words - and the v-voice - are f-failing me!</t8209><t8210>"</t8210>
<t8211>Ms. Harker was right in her instinct.</t8211> <t8212>Despite all of this being strange, and even though it would later seem awkward to us who felt its powerful effect at that moment, this prayer had greatly comforted us, and even the silence that marked the end of Ms. Harker's freedom did not seem as filled with despair as we had feared.</t8212>

<t8214>October 15.</t8214> <t8215>Varna.</t8215> <t8216>- We left Charing Cross on the morning of the 12th, arrived in Paris the same night, and took the places reserved for us on the Orient Express.</t8216> <t8217>We traveled all night and the next day, arriving here around five o'clock.</t8217> <t8218>When Lord Godalming went to the consulate to see if any telegrams had arrived for him, the rest of us came to this hotel - the Odessus.</t8218> <t8219>Although some incidents occurred during our journey, I was too eager to continue to pay them any mind.</t8219> <t8220>Until the Czarina Catherine docks, there will be nothing in the whole world that interests me.</t8220> <t8221>Thank God!</t8221> <t8222>Mina seems well and appears to be gaining strength; her color is returning.</t8222> <t8223>She sleeps a lot; she slept almost continuously throughout the journey.</t8223> <t8224>But she is extremely alert and vigilant just before sunrise and sunset, and at such times, it has become Van Helsing's habit to hypnotize her.</t8224> <t8225>Initially, it required some effort and the Professor had to move a lot, but now Mina seems to surrender immediately as if it has become a habit, and almost no movement is needed.</t8225> <t8226>At such moments, the Professor seems to have power over her will, and Mina's thoughts obey his words.</t8226> <t8227>He always asks her what she can see and hear.</t8227> <t8228>Mina's first response is as follows:</t8228>
<t8229>“Nothing; everywhere is dark.”</t8229> <t8230>And for the Second, it says:</t8230>
<t8231>"I can hear the sounds of waves hitting the hull of the ship and the sound of rapidly flowing waters.</t8231> <t8232>The sails and ropes are tightening, and the yards and other masts are creaking.</t8232> <t8233>The wind is strong - I can tell this from the sound of the sailcloth and the foam splashing from the bow of the ship."</t8233> <t8234>Clearly, the Czarina Catherine is still at sea and speeding towards Varna.</t8234> <t8235>Lord Godalming has just arrived.</t8235> <t8236>Four telegrams have arrived, one sent each day since we set out, and all concerning the same matter: the Czarina Catherine has not been recorded in Lloyd's registers from anywhere.</t8236> <t8237>Before leaving London, Lord Godalming had arranged for the agency to send him a telegram every day, informing him whether the ship had been registered or not.</t8237>
<t8238>Even if it wasn't recorded, he would get the news, thus he could be sure that someone was keeping watch on the other end of the wire.</t8238>
<t8239>We had our dinner and went to bed early.</t8239><t8240>Tomorrow we will see the consular assistant and, if we can manage, make arrangements to board the ship as soon as we arrive at the port.</t8240><t8241>Van Helsing says that boarding the ship between sunrise and sunset will be an opportunity for us.</t8241><t8242>Even if he takes the form of a bat, the Count cannot cross running water of his own will and thus cannot leave the ship.</t8242><t8243>And, to avoid suspicion - clearly something he wants to avoid - he will not dare to take human form and will have to remain in the box.</t8243><t8244>In this case, if we can board the ship after sunrise, he will be entirely at our mercy; because we can open the box and secure the situation before he wakes up, just as we did with poor Lucy.</t8244><t8245>The mercy he will receive from us will not mean much.</t8245><t8246>We do not anticipate any trouble with the authorities or the sailors.</t8246><t8247>Thank God, this is a country where bribery can open any door, and we have plenty of money!</t8247><t8248>We just need to make sure that the ship does not enter the port between sunset and sunrise without us being informed, so we can secure our plan.</t8248><t8249>I think Judge Moneybag will handle this case!</t8249>
<t8250>October 16.</t8250> <t8251>- The news from Mina is still the same: Waves crashing against the ship, the sound of water, darkness, and protective winds.</t8251> <t8252>It is clear that we have arrived in time; we will be ready when we hear from the Czarina Catherine.</t8252> <t8253>Since it has to pass through the Dardanelles, we will undoubtedly receive news.</t8253>
<t8254>October 17.</t8254> <t8255>- I think everything is now nicely arranged to welcome the Count after his trip.</t8255> <t8256>Godalming told the transporters that he believed the crate sent abroad contained goods stolen from his friend, and he almost got approval on the condition that he takes responsibility.</t8256> <t8257>The owner of the ship gave him a letter addressed to the Captain, instructing that every convenience be provided to Godalming when he boards the ship; he also gave a similar directive to his representative in Varna.</t8257> <t8258>We saw the representative, who was quite impressed by the courtesy shown by Godalming, and we were convinced that everything possible would be done to assist our requests.</t8258> <t8259>We have already decided what to do if we find the lid of the crate open.</t8259> <t8260>If the Count is there, Van Helsing and Dr. Seward will immediately cut off his head and drive a stake through his heart.</t8260> <t8261>Morris, Godalming, and I will prevent any interference with this process, even if we have to use the weapons we have ready with us.</t8261> <t8262>The Professor says that if we do these things to the Count's body, he will instantly turn to dust.</t8262> <t8263>In such a case, if there is any suspicion of murder, there will be no evidence against us.</t8263> <t8264>But even if he does not turn to dust, we will either stand by our actions or collapse, and perhaps one day these journals might serve as evidence to clear some of us.</t8264> <t8265>Speaking for myself; if this opportunity arises, I will gratefully seize it.</t8265> <t8266>We are determined to try every possible way to achieve our goal.</t8266> <t8267>We have arranged with some officials to be notified by a special messenger as soon as the Czarina Catherine appears.</t8267>
<t8268>October 24.</t8268> <t8269>- We waited the whole week.</t8269> <t8270>Every day a telegram comes to Godalming, but it's always the same story: "Not yet recorded."</t8270> <t8271>Mina's responses during the morning and evening hypnotisms haven't changed: The sound of waves hitting the ship, the sound of water, and creaking masts.</t8271>
<t8272>Rufus at Lloyd's London office</t8272>
<t8273>From Smith, Her Majesty's Consul in Varna</t8273>
<t8274>By means of his assistant, a Telegram to Lord Godalming,</t8274>
<t8275>October 24</t8275>
<t8276>It has been recorded that Czarina Catherine passed through the Dardanelles this morning.</t8276>
<t8277>Dr. Seward's journal</t8277>
<t8278>October 25.</t8278> <t8279>- How I miss my phonograph!</t8279> <t8280>Keeping a journal with a pen is very frustrating for me; but Van Helsing says I must do it.</t8280> <t8281>Yesterday, when a telegram came from Lloyd to Lord Godalming, we all went wild with excitement.</t8281> <t8282>I now understand how men feel when they learn it is time to take action in wars.</t8282> <t8283>Only Ms. Harker among us showed no sign of emotion.</t8283> <t8284>After all, it is not strange that she did not react; because we have been particularly careful to keep her uninformed about the situation and tried not to show any signs of excitement when around her.</t8284> <t8285>In the old days, I am sure she would have noticed no matter how much we tried to hide it, but in this regard, she has changed significantly in the past three weeks.</t8285> <t8286>The state of lethargy is increasing, and despite her appearing strong and healthy, and her color returning somewhat, Van Helsing and I are not pleased with her condition.</t8286> <t8287>We often talk about her, but we have not said a word to the others about it.</t8287> <t8288>Poor Harker would be hurt if he heard we had doubts about this - and undoubtedly his nerves would be shattered.</t8288> <t8289>Van Helsing says he carefully observes Ms. Harker's teeth while she is hypnotized, because according to him, as long as they do not sharpen over time, there is no danger of transformation.</t8289> <t8290>If this transformation occurs, some steps will need to be taken!</t8290> <t8291>Although we do not share our thoughts with each other, we both know what these steps are, and neither of us should avoid this duty - though it is terrible to think about, it is so.</t8291> <t8292>“Euthanasia” is a perfect and comforting word!</t8292> <t8293>I owe thanks to whoever coined this term.</t8293>
<t8294>According to the speed of Czarina Catherine coming from London, it will take approximately 24 hours for her to arrive here from the Dardanelles.</t8294> <t8295>Therefore, she should arrive here in the morning, but since she cannot dock at the port before then, we will all go to bed early.</t8295> <t8296>We will wake up at one o'clock to prepare.</t8296>
<t8297>October 25, noon.</t8297> <t8298>- No news regarding the ship's arrival.</t8298> <t8299>Ms. Harker's hypnotic report this morning was as usual, so we can receive news at any moment.</t8299> <t8300>All of us are excited except for the cool-headed Harker; Harker's hands are ice-cold and I saw her an hour ago, sharpening the large kukri she now constantly carries with her.</t8300> <t8301>Having the edge of the kukri pressed against his throat by a ruthless, ice-cold hand will be a nasty surprise for the Count.</t8301>
<t8302>Today, Van Helsing and I are a bit worried about Ms. Harker.</t8302> <t8303>Around noon, she fell into a state of sleep that we did not like at all; although we told the others, neither of us liked this situation.</t8303> <t8304>She was very restless all morning, so we were initially pleased when we learned she was asleep.</t8304> <t8305>But when her husband casually mentioned that she was sleeping very deeply and that he couldn't wake her up, we went to her room to see for ourselves.</t8305> <t8306>She was breathing normally and looked so well and peaceful that we agreed sleep was more beneficial for her than anything else.</t8306> <t8307>Poor girl, she has so much to forget that if it makes her indifferent, it is not surprising that sleep is good for her.</t8307>
<t8308>Later on.</t8308> <t8309>- It turned out that we were right in our thinking, because when he woke up from a few hours of refreshing sleep, he looked more lively and better than he had in recent days.</t8309> <t8310>At sunset, he presented his usual hypnotic report.</t8310> <t8311>Wherever he was in the Black Sea, the Count was rapidly progressing towards his destination.</t8311> <t8312>I hope towards his own demise!</t8312>
<t8313>October 26.</t8313> <t8314>- Another day has passed and there is still no news from the Czarina Catherine.</t8314> <t8315>It should have arrived by now.</t8315> <t8316>It is definitely still somewhere on the way because Ms. Harker's morning hypnotic report was still the same.</t8316> <t8317>Perhaps it has stopped from time to time due to the fog; some of the steamships that arrived last night reported that there was fog in places both north and south of the port.</t8317> <t8318>We must maintain our watch, for the ship's signal may come at any moment.</t8318>
<t8319>October 27, noon.</t8319> <t8320>- Very strange! There is still no news from the ship we are expecting.</t8320> <t8321>Ms. Harker reported ordinary things last night and this morning: Despite adding that "The waves are barely noticeable," she still mentioned, "The sound of waves hitting the ship and water."</t8321> <t8322>The telegrams from London were the same: "No new records."</t8322> <t8323>Van Helsing is terribly uneasy and just now told me that he fears the Count has escaped from us.</t8323> <t8324>And he added importantly:</t8324>
<t8325>“I did not like Madam Mina’s sleep condition.</t8325> <t8326>When in a trance state, spirits and memories can do strange things.”</t8326> <t8327>I was about to ask her more when Harker entered and the Professor signaled me to be silent.</t8327> <t8328>This evening at sunset, while Ms. Harker is hypnotized, we will try to make her talk more.</t8328>
<t8329>October 28 - At Lloyd's London office</t8329>
<t8330>From Rufus Smith, Her Majesty Varna</t8330>
<t8331>Through the Deputy Consul</t8331>
<t8332>Telegram to Lord Godalming</t8332>
<t8333>It was recorded today at one o'clock that Czarina Catherine entered Galaţi.</t8333>
<t8334>Dr. Seward's journal</t8334>
<t8335>October 28.</t8335> <t8336>- When we received the telegram announcing that the ship had arrived in Galaţi, I don't think it was as big a shock as it could have been for any of us.</t8336> <t8337>Okay, we didn't know where, how, or when it would come, but I think we were all expecting something strange to happen.</t8337> <t8338>The delay in arriving at Varna convinced us one by one that events would not unfold as we had expected; we only waited to learn where this change would occur.</t8338> <t8339>But still, it was a surprise.</t8339> <t8340>I think nature works on such a hopeful basis that, even against ourselves, we believe that everything will happen not as we know it will, but as it should.</t8340> <t8341>Though misleading for metaphysical people, it is a guide for angels.</t8341> <t8342>It was a strange experience, and we all perceived it differently.</t8342> <t8343>Van Helsing raised his hands above his head for a moment as if lamenting to God, but said not a word and stood up with a stern expression on his face within a few seconds.</t8343> <t8344>Lord Godalming's face turned pale, and he sat down, breathing heavily.</t8344> <t8345>I was half-dazed and looked at each person's face in curiosity.</t8345> <t8346>Quincey Morris tightened his belt with that quick motion I knew so well; in our old traveling days, this meant "action."</t8346> <t8347>Ms. Harker's face turned as white as a sheet, so much so that the scar on her forehead seemed to burn, but she meekly clasped her hands and looked upwards as if in prayer.</t8347> <t8348>Harker laughed - he really laughed - the dark, bitter laugh of a hopeless man; but at the same time, his actions contradicted his words because his hands instinctively searched for the hilt of the large kukri and grasped it.</t8348> <t8349>Van Helsing asked aloud, "When does the next train to Galaţi depart?"</t8349>
<t8350>“Tomorrow morning at 6.</t8350> <t8351>30!” We all stared in astonishment, because the response had come from Ms. Harker.</t8351>
<t8352>"How do you know?" asked Art.</t8352>
<t8353>“You forget -or perhaps you are unaware, though Jonathan and Dr. Van Helsing know- that I am an expert on trains.</t8353> <t8354>When I was at home in Exeter, I would always write down the train schedules to help my husband.</t8354> <t8355>I found this so useful at times that I now constantly study train schedules.</t8355> <t8356>If there was anything that would take us to Castle Dracula, I knew we had to go through Galaţi or somehow pass through Bucharest; thus, I learned the train times carefully.</t8356> <t8357>Unfortunately, there isn't much to learn, because the only train tomorrow leaves at the time I mentioned.</t8357><t8358>”</t8358>
<t8359>“The perfect woman!” whispered the Professor.</t8359>
<t8360>“Can’t we hire a special train?” asked Lord Godalming.</t8360> <t8361>Van Helsing shook his head.</t8361> <t8362>“I’m afraid not.</t8362> <t8363>This country is quite different from yours or mine; even if we had a special train, it wouldn’t arrive as quickly as a scheduled one.</t8363> <t8364>Besides, there is something we need to prepare for.</t8364> <t8365>We must think.</t8365> <t8366>Now, let’s organize what needs to be done.</t8366> <t8367>You, my friend Arthur, go to the train and get the tickets, ensuring everything is ready for us to depart in the morning.</t8367> <t8368>You, my friend Jonathan, go to the ship’s agent here and get the letters from him that will allow us to search the ship in Galaţi, just as we did here.</t8368> <t8369>Morris Quincey, you see the consular assistant and get any help he can provide from his colleague in Galaţi to smooth our way, so we don’t lose time while on the Danube.</t8369> <t8370>John, you will stay with Madam Mina and me, and we will exchange views; if your task takes too long, you might be late; it won’t be a problem at sunset because I am here for Madam’s report.</t8370><t8371>”</t8371>
<t8372>“Me too,” said Ms. Harker with a radiant expression reminiscent of her old days, “I will try to help you in every way and, as I used to, I will think and put things down on paper for you.</t8372> <t8373>Strangely, something is changing in me; I feel freer than I have been lately!” The three young men, who seemed to understand the significance of Ms. Harker's words, looked happier than before; but Van Helsing and I turned to each other with serious and troubled expressions.</t8373> <t8374>But we said nothing at that time.</t8374>
<t8375>When the three men went outside due to their assigned duties, Dr. Van Helsing asked Ms. Harker to look at the copies of the journals and to find the section in Harker's journal where he described his days at the castle.</t8375> <t8376>Ms. Harker went out to find it; when the door closed behind her, the Professor said to me:</t8376>
<t8377>“We are both thinking the same thing!</t8377> <t8378>Say it!</t8378><t8379>”</t8379>
<t8380>"There is a change.</t8380> <t8381>This glimmer of hope is getting on my nerves, because it might be deceiving us.</t8381><t8382>"</t8382>
<t8383>“No doubt! Do you know why I asked him to bring that text?</t8383><t8384>”</t8384>
<t8385>"No!" I said, "Unless it is to get an opportunity to meet with me alone.</t8385><t8386>"</t8386>
<t8387>“You are partly right, my friend John, but only partly.</t8387> <t8388>I want to tell you something.</t8388> <t8389>And oh, my friend, I am taking a great -terrible- risk.</t8389> <t8390>A thought occurred to me when Madam Mina said those words that caught both of our attention.</t8390> <t8391>Three days ago, while in a trance, the Count sent his spirit to read her mind, or rather, because he can move freely at sunrise and sunset, he took her along to see him in the earth box on the ship, accompanied by the flow of the waters.</t8391> <t8392>He learned that we are here, because Madam Mina, with her seeing eyes and hearing ears, has much more to tell in her free life compared to the Count, who is confined in his coffin-like box.</t8392> <t8393>Now, he will make his greatest effort to escape from us.</t8393> <t8394>At this moment, he does not want Madam Mina.</t8394> <t8395>With his vast knowledge, he knows that Madam Mina will come when he calls, but he has cut off his connection with her so that she does not go to him - he has distanced her from his influence.</t8395> <t8396>Ah! I have hope that our human mind, which has not been deprived of God's grace and has belonged to humans for a long time, will surpass the child's mind that has been lying in the grave for centuries, has not reached the dimensions of ours, and has remained small because it has worked selfishly.</t8396> <t8397>Here comes Madam Mina; not a word about her trance!</t8397> <t8398>She does not know about it; learning this at a moment when we need all her hope and courage could upset and drive her to despair; at a moment when we most need her great mind, which has been trained like a man's but belongs to a sweet woman, and which, despite not thinking of doing such a thing, could fully reclaim the special power the Count gave her.</t8398> <t8399>Shh! Let me speak, and you will learn.</t8399> <t8400>Ah, my friend John!</t8400> <t8401>We are in terrible trouble.</t8401> <t8402>I am more afraid than I have ever been before.</t8402> <t8403>We can only trust in the Almighty God.</t8403> <t8404>Be silent!</t8404> <t8405>Here she comes!</t8405><t8406>”</t8406>
<t8407>I thought the Professor would lose himself or have a hysterical fit just like when Lucy died, but he held himself together with great effort and completely controlled his nerves when Ms. Harker entered the room with a lively and happy expression, looking as if she had forgotten her sadness because she was busy working.</t8407> <t8408>As Ms. Harker entered, she handed some typed papers to Van Helsing.</t8408> <t8409>Van Helsing looked at the papers with a serious expression, and as he read what was written, his face lit up.</t8409> <t8410>Then, holding the pages between his thumb and other fingers, he began to speak: “A lesson is coming for you, my friend John, who has experienced so much so far - and for you too, dear Madam Mina, who are very young: Never be afraid to think.</t8410> <t8411>A vague thought was buzzing around in my mind, but I was afraid to let it fully take flight.</t8411> <t8412>Now, with more information in hand, I return to where that vague thought originated and see that it is not actually a vague thought; despite being very young and not yet strong enough to use its tiny wings, I see that it is a complete thought.</t8412> <t8413>Moreover, it is not a duck thought like my friend Hans Andersen’s ‘The Ugly Duckling,’ but a great swan thought that soars nobly on its large wings when the time comes to test them.</t8413> <t8414>Look, here I am reading what Jonathan wrote:</t8414>
<t8415>‘Another member of his race, in the following centuries, repeatedly brought his forces across the great river into Turkish lands; when repelled, knowing that only he could achieve absolute victory, he emerged again, again, and again, despite being the sole survivor from the blood-soaked battlefield where his troops were massacred.</t8415><t8416>’</t8416>
<t8417>What does this tell us?</t8417> <t8418>Not much, right?</t8418> <t8419>No! The Count’s childish mind understands nothing; that’s why he speaks so freely.</t8419> <t8420>Your adult mind understands nothing; my adult mind also understood nothing, until this very moment.</t8420> <t8421>No! A word came from someone who speaks without thinking because they do not know what their words mean - or could mean.</t8421> <t8422>Just like the elements in nature that progress in their paths and when they touch each other -Poof!- they cover the entire sky, blinding some, killing and destroying others, and revealing the depths of the earth with a sudden flash of light.</t8422> <t8423>Isn't that so?</t8423> <t8424>Anyway, let me explain.</t8424> <t8425>To start with, have you ever studied the philosophy of crime?</t8425> <t8426>‘Yes!’; ‘No!’ You, John, yes; because this is a field of study within the subject of madness.</t8426> <t8427>You, no, Madam Mina; because crime has never approached you - except once.</t8427> <t8428>Still, your mind works correctly and does not argue particulari ad universale.</t8428> <t8429>Criminals have such a characteristic.</t8429> <t8430>This holds true in all countries and at all times so much so that even a policeman who does not understand much philosophy knows this experimentally.</t8430> <t8431>To know experimentally means this.</t8431> <t8432>A criminal works for only one crime - that is, the real criminal who seems to have crime in their destiny and does not think of other crimes.</t8432> <t8433>The criminal does not have a fully adult mind.</t8433> <t8434>They are intelligent, cunning, and alert; but when it comes to the mind, they are not on par with an adult man.</t8434> <t8435>In many ways, they are close to a child’s mind.</t8435> <t8436>Now, our criminal also has crime in their destiny; they also have a child’s mind and do things that only a child would do.</t8436> <t8437>A small bird, a small fish, a small animal learns not by principles but by experiments; once they learn to do something, they have the foundation to start doing more.</t8437> <t8438>‘Dos pou sto,’ said Archimedes.</t8438> <t8439>‘Give me a place to stand, and I will move the world!’ Once they do something, it is the foundation that will turn a child’s mind into an adult mind; until they aim to do more, they continue to do the same thing each time, just as they did before!</t8439> <t8440>Oh, dear, I see that your eyes have opened and the flashing light shows distances far away,” because Ms. Harker had started clapping her hands and her eyes were shining brightly.</t8440> <t8441>The professor continued his speech:</t8441>
<t8442>“Now you will speak.</t8442> <t8443>Tell us two dry scientists what you saw with those sparkling eyes.” He took Ms. Harker's hand in his and held it as she spoke.</t8443> <t8444>While Ms. Harker was speaking, he was feeling her pulse with his thumb and forefinger - which I think he did instinctively and unconsciously.</t8444> <t8445>Ms. Harker said: “The Count is a criminal and from the criminal class.</t8445> <t8446>Nordau and Lombroso would classify him this way, and as a criminal, he has a defective mind.</t8446> <t8447>Therefore, when faced with difficulty, he seeks solutions in habits.</t8447> <t8448>The past offers clues, and a page we know about his past - and from his own mouth - tells us that once, as Mr. Morris put it, when he was 'pressed,' he returned to his homeland from the lands he tried to seize, and thus, without wasting time, he prepared for a new effort.</t8448> <t8449>He came back better equipped for his work and succeeded.</t8449> <t8450>He came to London to conquer a new country.</t8450> <t8451>He was defeated, and when all hopes of success were lost and his existence was endangered, he crossed the seas and returned to his homeland; just as he had previously crossed the Danube River and returned from Turkish lands.</t8451><t8452>”</t8452>
<t8453>“Beautiful, beautiful! Ah, you clever lady!” said Van Helsing enthusiastically, bending down to kiss Ms. Harker's hand.</t8453> <t8454>A second later, as if we were having a consultation in a patient's room, he calmly said to me:</t8454>
<t8455>“The pulse is only seventy-two; even amidst all this excitement.</t8455> <t8456>I am hopeful.” Turning again to Ms. Harker, he spoke with great anticipation:</t8456>
<t8457>“But go on.</t8457> <t8458>Go on!</t8458> <t8459>If you wish, there are more things you can tell.</t8459> <t8460>Don't be afraid, John and I know.</t8460> <t8461>I know in any case, and if you are right, I will tell you this.</t8461> <t8462>Speak without fear!</t8462><t8463>”</t8463>
<t8464>“I will try to do this; but if I seem selfish, forgive me.</t8464><t8465>”</t8465>
<t8466>“No! Don't be afraid, you must be selfish, because we are thinking of you.</t8466><t8467>”</t8467>
<t8468>“Then, because he is guilty, he is selfish; because his mind is small and his actions are based on selfishness, he limits himself to a single purpose.</t8468> <t8469>This purpose is ruthless.</t8469> <t8470>Just as he abandoned his warrior forces to defeat and fled across the Danube, he is determined to be safe without paying attention to anything.</t8470> <t8471>Therefore, his own selfishness frees me from the power he gained over me on that dreadful night.</t8471> <t8472>I felt it, oh! I felt it.</t8472> <t8473>Thank God for His mercy!</t8473> <t8474>Since that dreadful hour, my soul has never been so free; the only thing that haunts me is the fear that he will use my knowledge for his own purposes while I am in a trance or dreaming.”</t8474> <t8475>The professor stood up:</t8475>
<t8476>“He used your mind in this way and by that means, while the ship carrying him was undoubtedly making preparations to escape us, swiftly heading towards Galaţi through the surrounding mist, he left us here in Varna.</t8476> <t8477>But a child's mind can only see so far ahead; by the providence of God, it is likely that the thing the wrongdoer relies on most for his own good will turn out to be the very thing that causes him the greatest harm.</t8477> <t8478>As the Prophet David has decreed, the hunter falls into his own trap.</t8478> <t8479>For now, thinking he has completely lost all trace and is hours ahead of us, his selfish child’s mind will whisper to him to sleep.</t8479> <t8480>He also thinks that because he has stopped reading your mind, you will not be able to gain any information about him; this is where he is mistaken!</t8480> <t8481>The terrible blood baptism he subjected you to allows you to go to him spiritually, just as you did freely at sunrise and sunset when you were free.</t8481> <t8482>At such times, you go not by his will, but by mine; you have gained this power, which is for your and others' benefit, through suffering at his hands.</t8482> <t8483>Now, it is more valuable than anything that he does not know this and disconnects the link in order to protect himself, so that he will not know where we are.</t8483> <t8484>But we are not entirely selfish and believe that God is with us in all this darkness and dark hours.</t8484> <t8485>Even if we risk becoming like him, we will follow him; we will not retreat.</t8485> <t8486>My friend John, this was a very important hour; it caused much to propel us on our way.</t8486> <t8487>You must take on the duty of scribe and write it all down; then, they will know these things as we do.</t8487><t8488>”</t8488>
<t8489>And so, while waiting for their return, I wrote this, and since Ms. Harker brought us her typewriter, she typed it up.</t8489>
<t8490>XXVI</t8490>
<t8491>Dr. Seward's journal</t8491>
<t8492>October 29.</t8492> <t8493>- This was written on the train from Varna to Galaţi.</t8493> <t8494>Last evening, we all gathered a little before sunset.</t8494> <t8495>Each of us had performed our respective duties as well as we could; as long as there was thought, effort, and opportunity, we were ready for the entirety of our journey and the tasks we would undertake when we reached Galaţi.</t8495> <t8496>At the usual time, Ms. Harker prepared for her hypnotic effort; after Van Helsing's unusually long and more intense effort, she fell into a trance.</t8496> <t8497>Ms. Harker usually speaks in a suggestive manner, but this time the Professor had to ask her questions and direct them with great determination before learning anything; finally, the answer came: “I can’t see anything; we are stationary; there are no waves hitting the ship, only a gentle swirl of calm water hitting the ropes lightly.</t8497> <t8498>I can hear men calling out nearby and far away, and the creaking of oars in the rowlocks.</t8498> <t8499>A gun was fired somewhere; its echo seems distant.</t8499> <t8500>There are footsteps above and ropes and chains being dragged.</t8500> <t8501>What is this? Light is coming; I can feel the air blowing over me.</t8501><t8502>”</t8502>
<t8503>He stopped here.</t8503> <t8504>As if without thinking, he got up from where he was lying on the couch and raised both his hands in the air as if lifting weights, with his palms facing upward.</t8504> <t8505>Van Helsing and I looked at each other with understanding.</t8505>
<t8506>As Harker's hand instinctively went to the hilt of his knife, Quincey slightly raised his eyebrows and looked attentively at Ms. Harker.</t8506> <t8507>There was a long silence.</t8507> <t8508>We all knew that the time when Ms. Harker could speak was passing; but we felt that saying something would be of no use.</t8508> <t8509>Ms. Harker suddenly sat up and gently said as she opened her eyes:</t8509>
<t8510>"Wouldn't you like a cup of tea?</t8510> <t8511>You all must be very tired!" We accepted her offer solely out of the desire to please her.</t8511> <t8512>She hurriedly left the room to bring tea; as she exited the room, Van Helsing began to speak:</t8512>
<t8513>“You see, my friends.</t8513> <t8514>The Count is near the shore: He has left his earth chest.</t8514> <t8515>But he still needs to come ashore.</t8515> <t8516>He can hide somewhere at night; but if he is not carried ashore or if the ship does not touch the shore, he cannot manage to reach land.</t8516> <t8517>If this happens at night, he can change form as he did in Whitby and leap or fly to land.</t8517> <t8518>But if it becomes daylight before he reaches the shore, then he cannot escape unless someone carries him.</t8518> <t8519>And if he is carried, then the customs officers might discover what is inside the chest.</t8519> <t8520>So, in short, if he does not escape to the shore tonight or before dawn, he will lose the entire day.</t8520> <t8521>Then, we can reach him in time, because if he does not escape at night, we can find him during the day, trapped in his chest, at our mercy, as he will not dare to be in his own form, awake and visible, to avoid being discovered.</t8521><t8522>”</t8522>
<t8523>There was nothing else to say, so we patiently waited for dawn; when that time came, we could learn something from Ms. Harker.</t8523>
<t8524>This morning, early, we listened breathlessly to Ms. Harker's responses in her trance state.</t8524> <t8525>The arrival of her hypnotic state took even longer than before, and by the time this phase came, so little time was left until the sun fully rose that we began to lose hope.</t8525> <t8526>Van Helsing seemed to have dedicated his entire soul to this effort; finally, Ms. Harker, complying with the Professor's will, responded:</t8526>
<t8527>"Everywhere is dark.</t8527> <t8528>I hear the sound of waves at the same level as me and a creaking noise as if wood is rubbing against wood."</t8528> <t8529>He paused and suddenly a red sun appeared.</t8529> <t8530>We must wait until tonight.</t8530>
<t8531>And so we travel towards Galaţi with the pain of anticipation.</t8531> <t8532>We need to arrive between two and three in the morning, but we are still three hours delayed in Bucharest, so it is unlikely we will arrive before sunrise.</t8532> <t8533>Thus, we will receive two more hypnotic messages from Ms. Harker; one or both of these might shed some light on what is happening.</t8533>
<t8534>Later.</t8534> <t8535>- Sunset came and went.</t8535> <t8536>Fortunately, it came when there was nothing distracting because if it had happened while we were at the station, we might not have been able to provide the necessary silence and isolation.</t8536> <t8537>Ms. Harker was even less willing to succumb to the hypnotic effect than she was this morning.</t8537> <t8538>I fear that at the very time we need her the most, the Count's power to read her senses is gradually diminishing.</t8538> <t8539>It seems as if Ms. Harker's imagination is starting to work.</t8539> <t8540>Until now, she has kept herself limited to the simplest facts during her trance.</t8540> <t8541>If this continues, there is a possibility that she might eventually mislead us.</t8541> <t8542>If I thought that the Count's power over Ms. Harker would decrease to the same extent as Ms. Harker's power to gather information, it would be a comforting thought, but I fear this will not be the case.</t8542> <t8543>When Ms. Harker spoke, her words were like riddles:</t8543>
<t8544>“Something is coming out; I can feel it passing over me like a cold wind.</t8544> <t8545>I hear mixed sounds from afar; men speaking in strange languages, water pouring harshly, and wolves howling.”</t8545> <t8546>He stopped and shivered; the intensity of his trembling increased for a few seconds until he shook as if having a seizure.</t8546> <t8547>He didn't say anything else; he didn't even respond to the Professor's authoritative questions.</t8547> <t8548>When he woke up from the trance, he was cold, tired, and weak but his mind was clear.</t8548> <t8549>He remembered nothing and asked what he had said; when it was recounted to him, he pondered over it in silence for a long time.</t8549>
<t8550>October 30, 7 AM.</t8550> <t8551>- We are now approaching Galaţi, and I may not have time to write later.</t8551> <t8552>This morning's sunrise was eagerly awaited by all of us.</t8552> <t8553>Knowing that it was becoming increasingly difficult to put Ms. Harker into a hypnotic trance, Van Helsing had started his attempts earlier than usual.</t8553> <t8554>But Ms. Harker did not succumb until just a minute before the usual time, which is just before sunrise, and even then with greater difficulty, rendering the Professor's attempts ineffective until then.</t8554> <t8555>The Professor wasted no time in asking questions; Ms. Harker's response came with equal swiftness:</t8555>
<t8556>“Everywhere is dark.</t8556> <t8557>I hear the sound of water at the same level as my ears and the creaking of wood rubbing against each other.</t8557> <t8558>In the distance, the bellowing of cattle.</t8558> <t8559>There is another sound, a strange sound; as if...”</t8559> <t8560>He stopped and his face turned completely white.</t8560>
<t8561>“Go on; go on!</t8561> <t8562>Speak, I command you!” said Van Helsing in a voice filled with suffering.</t8562> <t8563>At the same time, there was despair in his eyes, because the rising sun was painting even Ms. Harker's pale face red.</t8563> <t8564>Ms. Harker opened her eyes, and when she began to speak sweetly and with all her interest, we all shuddered:</t8564>
<t8565>“Ah, Professor, why do you ask me to do things you know I can't do?</t8565> <t8566>I don't remember anything.”</t8566> <t8567>Then, seeing the astonishment on our faces, he looked at each of us with a troubled expression and said:</t8567>
<t8568>"What did I say?</t8568> <t8569>What did I do?</t8569> <t8570>Here, lying half-asleep, and you saying, 'Continue!</t8570> <t8571>Speak, I command you!' I know nothing else?</t8571> <t8572>It's very strange to hear you giving me orders as if I were a bad child!</t8572><t8573>"</t8573>
<t8574>"Ah, Madam Mina," said Van Helsing with sorrow, "if proof is needed for this, it is the proof of how much I love you and how much I respect you. A word spoken with such sincerity for your well-being may seem very strange, because it means giving orders to someone to whom I bow with pride!"</t8574><t8575>"</t8575>
<t8576>Whistles are blowing; we are approaching Galaţi.</t8576> <t8577>We are burning with anxiety and curiosity.</t8577>
<t8578>Mina Harker's diary</t8578>
<t8579>October 30.</t8579> <t8580>- Since he didn't know any foreign languages and had no other duties, Mr. Morris took me to the hotel where our rooms were reserved by telegraph.</t8580> <t8581>The forces were dispersed as they were in Varna; however, since we were in a great hurry, Lord Godalming went to the vice-consul, thinking his social status might provide some form of official assistance.</t8581> <t8582>Jonathan and the two doctors went to the shipping agency to learn the details of the Czarina Catherine's arrival.</t8582>
<t8583>Later.</t8583> <t8584>- Lord Godalming returned.</t8584> <t8585>The consul was out and his assistant was sick; therefore, an officer was handling the routine matters.</t8585> <t8586>The man was very kind and said he would do everything within his power.</t8586>
<t8587>Jonathan Harker's journal</t8587>
<t8588>October 30.</t8588> <t8589>- At nine o'clock, Dr. Van Helsing, Dr. Seward, and I paid a short visit to Mackenzie & Stenkoff, the agent of the London firm Hapgood.</t8589> <t8590>In response to Lord Godalming's telegraphed request, they had received a telegram from London asking them to show us every possible courtesy.</t8590> <t8591>They were more than courteous and respectful, and immediately took us to the Czarina Catherine, anchored at the river port.</t8591> <t8592>The captain, named Donelson, told us about his voyage.</t8592> <t8593>He said he had never progressed on his route under such favorable conditions in his entire life.</t8593>
<t8594>“Wow!” he said with an accented voice, “but it scared us, because we thought we would have to pay for it with a rare misfortune to even the situation.</t8594> <t8595>From London to the Black Sea, it is not natural at all to have the wind at your back as if the devil himself is blowing into your sails for his own purposes.</t8595> <t8596>And at that time, we couldn't see anything.</t8596> <t8597>When we approached a ship or a port or a cape, fog descended upon us and traveled with us; but after the fog lifted and we looked around, we could see some damn things.</t8597> <t8598>We passed Gibraltar without being able to send a signal; until we came to the Dardanelles and had to wait for our passage permit, we didn't see anyone close enough to hail.</t8598> <t8599>At first, I was inclined to slacken the sails until the fog lifted; but then I thought if the devil is determined to get us to the Black Sea quickly, he will do it whether we want it or not.</t8599> <t8600>If he makes a fast journey, it won't cause any trouble between us and the owners of this ship, our traffic won't be disrupted; and the Old Man, who serves his main purpose because we didn't hinder his work, would be grateful enough to us.</t8600><t8601>”</t8601>
<t8602>This simplicity, a mixture of superstitious cunning and commercial logic, spurred Van Helsing into action, and he said: "My friend, that Devil is smarter than some think, and when he meets his match, he knows it!" The Captain, not at all pleased with this compliment, continued his speech:</t8602>
<t8603>"When we crossed the Bosphorus in Istanbul, the men started grumbling; some of them, Romanians, came to me and asked me to throw a large crate that a strange-looking old man had loaded onto the ship just before we set off from London into the sea.</t8603> <t8604>I had seen them glaring at the man and raising two fingers to ward off the evil eye when they saw him.</t8604> <t8605>Wow! But the superstitions of foreigners are complete nonsense!</t8605> <t8606>I quickly sent them back to their duties; but immediately after, when the fog descended upon us, although I couldn't say for sure it was related to the crate, I felt they were up to something.</t8606> <t8607>Anyway, we continued our journey and when the fog didn't lift for five days, I let the wind take us, because if the Devil wanted to go somewhere - well, he would get his job done somehow.</t8607> <t8608>And if he didn't, we would be on the lookout.</t8608> <t8609>Indeed, we made good progress and always sailed in deep waters; two days ago, when the daytime sun broke through the fog, we found ourselves in the river opposite Galaţi.</t8609> <t8610>The Romanians went crazy, asking me to take the crate out and throw it into the river, whether it was right or wrong.</t8610> <t8611>I had to argue with them with a lever in my hand, and when the last of them got up from the ground holding his head, I convinced them that it was better for the shipowners' goods and consignments to be in my hands rather than in the Danube River, whether there was an evil eye or not.</t8611> <t8612>They had brought the crate onto the deck to throw it into the river, and since it was labeled 'Via Varna to Galaţi,' I thought of letting it stay on the deck until we unloaded the goods at the port and got rid of the crate entirely.</t8612> <t8613>We didn't clear customs that day and had to stay anchored overnight; but early in the morning, an hour before sunrise, a man came with instructions written from England, stating that he was to take a crate for someone named Count Dracula.</t8613> <t8614>Everything was in the man's hands.</t8614> <t8615>His documents were in order, and since I was getting uneasy about the matter, I was glad to be rid of the damn thing.</t8615> <t8616>If there was the Devil's baggage on the ship, I thought it must be this crate!</t8616><t8617>"</t8617>
<t8618>Van Helsing asked, barely containing his impatience, "What was the name of the man who took the chest?"</t8618>
<t8619>“I will tell you quickly!” replied the captain, and he went down to his cabin and brought back a receipt signed by “Immanuel Heildesheim.”</t8619> <t8620>The address was Burgenstraße, number 16.</t8620> <t8621>We understood that this was all the captain knew; thus, we thanked him and left.</t8621>
<t8622>We found Hildesheim in his office, with his nose resembling a sheep's and his fez making him look more like the Jewish characters at the Adelphi Theatre.</t8622> <t8623>His objections were silenced with money - we interrupted him - and with a bit of bargaining, he told us everything he knew.</t8623> <t8624>What he told us turned out to be simple but important.</t8624> <t8625>He had received a letter from Mr. de Ville of London, instructing him to collect a crate arriving with the Czarina Catherine in Galaţi, if possible before sunrise, to avoid customs officers.</t8625> <t8626>He was told to deliver it to someone named Petrov Skinski, who worked with Slovaks transporting goods from the river to the port.</t8626> <t8627>He was paid for his task with British money, properly converted into gold at the Danube International Bank.</t8627> <t8628>When Skinski came to him, he took him to the ship and handed over the crate to save on transportation costs.</t8628> <t8629>That was all he knew.</t8629>
<t8630>Then we called Skinski, but we couldn't manage to find him.</t8630> <t8631>A neighbor, who didn't seem to feel much affection towards him, said he left two days ago and no one knows where he is.</t8631> <t8632>This statement was confirmed by the landlord, who received the house key and the due rent in British currency from an intermediary.</t8632> <t8633>This happened between ten and eleven last night.</t8633> <t8634>Once again, our progress was hindered.</t8634>
<t8635>While we were talking, someone came running and out of breath, and said that Skinski's body had been found in the garden of St. Peter's Church, with his throat torn apart as if by a wild animal.</t8635> <t8636>The people we were talking to ran to see the horror, and the women were shouting, "This is the work of the Slovaks!"</t8636> <t8637>We quickly moved away so as not to get involved in the incident, and thus our work was hindered.</t8637>
<t8638>When we arrived, we couldn't come to a definite conclusion.</t8638> <t8639>We were all convinced that the chest was being transported somewhere by sea, but we would have to find out where it was going.</t8639> <t8640>Reluctantly, we returned to the hotel to be with Mina.</t8640>
<t8641>The first thing we did when we came together was to exchange views on whether to confide our secrets to Mina again.</t8641> <t8642>Things are getting more serious, and although this might be dangerous, it could at least be a chance.</t8642> <t8643>As a start, I was exempted from the promise I made to her.</t8643>
<t8644>Mina Harker's diary</t8644>
<t8645>October 30, evening.</t8645> <t8646>- They were so tired, exhausted, and unenthusiastic that there was nothing to be done until they rested a bit; so I asked them to lie down for half an hour while I wrote down what had happened so far.</t8646> <t8647>I owe such gratitude to the man who invented the "Journey" typewriter and to Mr. Morris who brought it to me!</t8647> <t8648>If I had to write with a pen, I would make mistakes while doing the work...</t8648>
<t8649>Everything is completed; poor dear, dear Jonathan, who knows what he has endured, who knows what he is enduring.</t8649> <t8650>He is lying on the couch, looking as if he is having difficulty breathing, and his entire body appears collapsed.</t8650> <t8651>His eyebrows are furrowed; his face is strained with pain.</t8651> <t8652>Poor man, perhaps he is thinking; I can see that his face is completely wrinkled with the intensity of his thoughts.</t8652> <t8653>Oh! I wish I could help him....</t8653> <t8654>I will do everything I can...</t8654>
<t8655>I asked Dr. Van Helsing and he brought me all the documents I hadn't seen yet...</t8655> <t8656>While they rest, I will carefully go over all of them; maybe I can reach a conclusion.</t8656> <t8657>I will take an example from the professor and think without prejudice about the facts in front of me...</t8657>
<t8658>I believe I have discovered something with God's permission.</t8658> <t8659>I will take and examine the maps...</t8659>
<t8660>I am more certain than ever that I am right.</t8660> <t8661>The new conclusion I have reached is ready, so I will gather our group and read it.</t8661> <t8662>They can make a judgment; it is important not to make a mistake, every minute is valuable.</t8662>
<t8663>Mina Harker's notes (Recorded in her journal.</t8663><t8664>)</t8664>
<t8665>Research foundation.</t8665> <t8666>- Count Dracula's problem is returning to his place.</t8666>
<t8667>(a) Must be taken back by someone.</t8667> <t8668>This is obvious; because if a person could act as they wished, they could transform into a wolf, bat, or another form and leave.</t8668> <t8669>Clearly, in the desperation I am sure he is in -trapped in a wooden box between dawn and sunset- he fears being discovered or having his work interfered with.</t8669>
<t8670>(b) How will it be transported?</t8670> <t8671>- Here, the elimination method might be useful for us.</t8671> <t8672>By road, by rail, or by waterway?</t8672>
<t8673>1.</t8673> <t8674>By road.</t8674> <t8675>- There are endless difficulties that can be encountered, especially when leaving a city.</t8675>
<t8676>(x) There are people; people are curious and they ask questions.</t8676> <t8677>A hint, guess, or doubt about what might be in the chest will ruin it.</t8677>
<t8678>(y) There are or may be customs officers or tax officials to pass through.</t8678>
<t8679>(z) Those who chase him can follow.</t8679> <t8680>This is his greatest fear; to avoid being caught, he even repelled his victim - that is, me - as much as he could!</t8680>
<t8681>2.</t8681> <t8682>By railroad.</t8682> <t8683>- There will be no one responsible for the chest.</t8683> <t8684>He will have to risk the possibility of delay, and with enemies on his trail, a delay would be fatal.</t8684> <t8685>Sure, he could escape at night, but what if he ends up in a foreign place without a refuge to run to?</t8685> <t8686>This is not what he intends, and he does not want to jeopardize his goal.</t8686>
<t8687>3.</t8687> <t8688>By water.</t8688> <t8689>- Indeed, in one sense the safest, but in another sense the most dangerous route.</t8689> <t8690>While in the water, powerless except at night; even then, it can only summon mist, storm, snow, and its wolves.</t8690> <t8691>But if there is a shipwreck, the living water leaves it helpless and swallows it, and it truly disappears.</t8691> <t8692>It can bring the vessel to shore, but if it is in enemy territory without freedom of movement, its situation remains hopeless.</t8692>
<t8693>From the records, we know that it is on the water; therefore, what we need to do is determine which water it is.</t8693>
<t8694>First of all, we need to fully understand what you have done so far; then, we can find some insight into what your next step should be.</t8694>
<t8695>First of all, during a period when he had to manage his time and do his best under tight constraints, we must recognize what he did in London as part of the overall movement plan.</t8695>
<t8696>Secondly, we need to understand what he is doing here, as much as we can infer from the facts we know.</t8696>
<t8697>Regarding the first one, it is clear that he aimed to reach Galaţi and sent an invoice to Varna to deceive us so that we wouldn't learn the real reason for his departure from England; at that time, his sole purpose was to escape.</t8697> <t8698>The proof of this is the instruction letter sent to Immanuel Hildesheim, telling him to receive the crate before sunrise.</t8698> <t8699>There are also instructions given to Petrov Skinski.</t8699> <t8700>Here, we can only speculate; but since Skinski arrived at Hildesheim, there must have been a letter or a message.</t8700>
<t8701>We know that their plans so far have been successful.</t8701> <t8702>Czarina Catherine made an astonishingly fast journey - so much so that it aroused Captain Donelson's suspicion; but his superstition, combined with his shrewdness, played into the Count's hands on his behalf, and he sped rapidly through the mists with a protective wind until he reached Galaţi blindly.</t8702> <t8703>It has been proven that the Count's arrangements were well made.</t8703> <t8704>Hildesheim took the chest and delivered it to Skinski.</t8704> <t8705>Skinski took it - and we lost track of it there.</t8705> <t8706>All we know is that the chest is moving somewhere over the water.</t8706> <t8707>Customs and tax officers, if there were any, must have been avoided.</t8707>
<t8708>Now, we come to what the Count might have done after disembarking in Galaţi.</t8708>
<t8709>The chest was delivered to Skinski before sunrise.</t8709> <t8710>At sunrise, the Count could appear in his own form.</t8710> <t8711>Here, we must ask why Skinski was chosen to assist in these matters.</t8711> <t8712>In my husband's journal, Skinski is mentioned as someone who goes down the river to the port and does business with the Slovaks; a man's comment there that the murder was the work of the Slovaks shows his general feelings towards this class.</t8712> <t8713>The Count wanted to be alone.</t8713>
<t8714>My guess is this: The Count decided to return to his castle via the most reliable and secret route, the waterway, while he was in London.</t8714> <t8715>He had been removed from the castle by the Gypsies, and most likely they had handed over their cargo, the crates, to the Slovaks who took them to Varna; from Varna, they were loaded onto a ship to be taken to London.</t8715> <t8716>Thus, the Count had gathered information about the people who could arrange this service.</t8716> <t8717>While the crate was on land, either before sunrise or after sunset, he met with Skinski and instructed him to arrange for the crate to be transported along the river.</t8717> <t8718>When these tasks were completed and he realized everything was progressing smoothly, he thought he had covered his tracks by killing his intermediary.</t8718>
<t8719>I examined the map and saw that the most suitable river for the Slovaks to exit was either the Prut or the Seret.</t8719> <t8720>In the typed texts, I read that when I entered a trance, I heard distant cow sounds, water sounds at ear level, and the creaking of wood.</t8720> <t8721>So, the Count was on an open boat on the river - most likely being propelled by oars or poles because the two banks of the river are close and the boat is moving against the current.</t8721> <t8722>If he were letting himself drift with the current, such sounds wouldn't be heard.</t8722>
<t8723>Of course, it may not be the Seret and the Prut, but we can certainly do more research.</t8723> <t8724>Now, of the two, the journey on the Prut is easier, but the Seret is located in Fundu and joins the Bistriţa, which runs along the Borgo Pass.</t8724> <t8725>The point where the river bends is the closest place to reach Dracula's castle by water.</t8725>
<t8726>Mina Harker's diary (continued)</t8726>
<t8727>When I finished reading, Jonathan took me in his arms and kissed me.</t8727> <t8728>The others shook my hand with both of theirs and Dr. Van Helsing said:</t8728>
<t8729>“Dear Madam Mina has once again become our teacher.</t8729> <t8730>Where we were blind, her eyes saw.</t8730> <t8731>Now we are once again on the trail, and this time we may succeed.</t8731> <t8732>Our enemy is at his weakest, and if we can find him in the water during the day, our task will be over.</t8732> <t8733>He started a step ahead, but because he cannot leave his box without arousing suspicion from those carrying him, he is too weak to hasten; to arouse suspicion in his men would mean provoking them to cast him into the stream where he would be lost forever.</t8733> <t8734>He knows this and will not do so.</t8734> <t8735>Now, gentlemen, let us convene our war council, for we must plan what each of us is to do.</t8735><t8736>”</t8736>
<t8737>“I will find a steamship and follow him,” said Lord Godalming.</t8737>
<t8738>"And I will find horses to follow along the riverbank, in case by some chance he might have come ashore," said Mr. Morris.</t8738>
<t8739>“Beautiful!” said the Professor, “Both are beautiful.</t8739> <t8740>But neither of you should go alone.</t8740> <t8741>If strength is needed, there must be strength to overcome it; Slovaks are strong and tough and carry tough weapons.”</t8741> <t8742>All the men laughed, because they were carrying a small arsenal with them.</t8742> <t8743>Mr. Morris took the floor:</t8743>
<t8744>“I brought a few Winchesters; they are quite useful in a crowd, and there might be wolves around.</t8744> <t8745>If you recall, the Count had taken some other precautions; he had made some requests that Ms. Harker could not hear or understand well.</t8745> <t8746>We must be prepared in every way.” Dr. Seward said:</t8746>
<t8747>"I think it would be best if I go with Quincey.</t8747> <t8748>We are used to hunting together and, well-armed, the two of us can handle anything that may arise.</t8748> <t8749>You shouldn't go alone either, Art.</t8749> <t8750>We might have to fight the Slovaks, and a random attack—because I don't think these men carry weapons—could ruin all our plans.</t8750> <t8751>This time we must not leave anything to chance; we will not stop until the Count's head is separated from his body and we are sure he will not rise again." He looked at Jonathan as he spoke, and Jonathan looked at me.</t8751> <t8752>I could see the poor thing was torn.</t8752> <t8753>Of course, he wanted to stay by my side, but then, that boat trip would most likely be the thing that destroys the vam... vam...</t8753> <t8754>vampire.</t8754> <t8755>(Why am I hesitant to write that word?) He remained silent for a while, and during his silence, Dr. Van Helsing spoke:</t8755>
<t8756>“My friend Jonathan, this task is yours for two reasons.</t8756> <t8757>First, because you are young, courageous, and capable of fighting, and for this last reason, all your strength may be needed, and it is your right to destroy this person who has caused such suffering to you and your loved ones.</t8757> <t8758>Do not worry about Madam Mina; if I can, she will be under my protection.</t8758> <t8759>I am old.</t8759> <t8760>My legs can no longer run as fast as they used to, and I am not accustomed to long rides, chases, or fighting with deadly weapons as required.</t8760> <t8761>But I can serve in other ways; I can fight in other ways.</t8761> <t8762>And if necessary, I can die like men younger than myself.</t8762> <t8763>Now, with your permission, let me tell you what I will do: Lord Godalming and my friend Jonathan, while you advance on the river with your fast, small steamship, and John and Quincey guard the riverbank where the Count might have found an opportunity, I will take Madam Mina to the very heart of our enemy's country.</t8763> <t8764>While the old fox progresses over the water, unable to escape ashore - the Slovak carriers, out of fear, do not dare to lift the lid of his coffin and leave him to decay - we will follow Jonathan's tracks, go from Bistriţa to Borgo, and from there find the way to Dracula's Castle.</t8764> <t8765>Here, Madam Mina's hypnotic power will certainly be of help, and following the first sunrise near that hateful place, with the help of her hypnotic power, we will find the otherwise completely dark and foreign path to us.</t8765> <t8766>There is much work to be done to destroy the nests of vipers, and other places to be sanctified.” Here Jonathan interrupted excitedly:</t8766>
<t8767>“So, Professor Van Helsing, are you saying that you will take Mina, in her distressing condition and tainted by the devil's affliction, right into the heart of the Count's death trap?</t8767> <t8768>Not in this world!</t8768> <t8769>For the love of Heaven and Hell, no!” He was almost speechless for a while and then continued:</t8769>
<t8770>“Do you know what kind of place that is?</t8770> <t8771>Have you seen that dreadful hole filled with diabolical abominations - do you know that even the moonlight itself, with its terrifying shapes, and every dust particle flying in the wind are the embryos of a devouring monster?</t8771> <t8772>Have you felt the Vampire's lips on your throat?”</t8772> <t8773>Here he turned to me, and with his eyes fixed on my forehead, he raised his arms into the air and cried out: “Oh, God! What have we done to deserve this horror!” and collapsed onto the couch in agony.</t8773> <t8774>The Professor's voice, which seemed to vibrate in the air with clear, sweet tones, calmed us all as he spoke:</t8774>
<t8775>“Ah, my friend! Because I will protect Madam Mina from that dreadful place I am going to.</t8775><t8776>God spare me from taking her to that dreadful place.</t8776><t8777>There, there are things that must be done -savage things- that she cannot see.</t8777><t8778>All the men here, except Jonathan, have seen with our own eyes what needs to be done to cleanse that castle.</t8778><t8779>Remember, we are in a terrible predicament.</t8779><t8780>If the Count escapes us this time -a strong, cunning, and sly one- he may choose to sleep for a century, and in time our dear lady,” -he held my hand- “would go to join him, and Jonathan would become like the others you have seen.</t8780><t8781>You told us about their malevolent lips; you heard their mocking laughter as they grabbed the moving sack the Count threw to them.</t8781><t8782>You are trembling; let it be.</t8782><t8783>Forgive me for causing you such pain, but it is necessary.</t8783><t8784>My friend, if this thing for which I would give my life is not an urgent need, what is?</t8784><t8785>If someone goes to stay there, I must go with them to accompany them.</t8785><t8786>”</t8786>
<t8787>“Do whatever you want,” said Jonathan, with a sob that shook his entire body.</t8787> <t8788>“We are in God's hands!</t8788><t8789>”</t8789>
<t8790>Later on.</t8790> <t8791>- Ah, it did me good to see how these brave men work.</t8791> <t8792>When men are so sincere, so honest, and so brave, how can women help but love them!</t8792> <t8793>And this made me think of the perfect power of money.</t8793> <t8794>What can't it do when used correctly!</t8794> <t8795>And what can it do when used cowardly!</t8795> <t8796>I am grateful that Lord Godalming is rich, and that both he and Mr. Morris, who also has plenty of money, are ready to spend their money so freely.</t8796> <t8797>Because if they weren't, our little expedition could neither start so quickly nor be so well-equipped as it will be in an hour.</t8797> <t8798>It hasn't even been three hours since we organized the tasks each of us has to do, and now Lord Godalming and Jonathan have a nice steam launch ready to go at any moment.</t8798> <t8799>Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris have half a dozen well-equipped fine horses.</t8799> <t8800>We have taken all the maps and every kind of equipment we could find.</t8800> <t8801>Professor Van Helsing and I will go to Veresti tonight on the 11:40 train, where we will arrange for a carriage to take us to the Borgo Pass.</t8801> <t8802>We have plenty of cash with us as we will buy a carriage and horses.</t8802> <t8803>We will drive the carriage ourselves, as there is no one we can trust with this task.</t8803> <t8804>The professor knows many languages, so we will not have any problems.</t8804> <t8805>We are all armed, and even I have been given a large-caliber pistol; Jonathan would not be happy if I were not armed like the others.</t8805> <t8806>Alas! I cannot carry one of the weapons the others have; the scar on my forehead does not allow it.</t8806> <t8807>Dear Dr. Van Helsing reassures me by saying that I am fully armed because there might be wolves; with each passing hour, the weather gets colder, and there are flurries of snow coming and going as if to warn us.</t8807>
<t8808>Later.</t8808> <t8809>- I had to muster all my courage to say goodbye to my lover.</t8809> <t8810>We may never see each other again.</t8810> <t8811>Courage, Mina! You must not shed tears now - unless God allows them to be shed in happiness.</t8811>
<t8812>Jonathan Harker's journal</t8812>
<t8813>October 30, evening.</t8813> <t8814>- I am writing these lines by the light coming from the furnace door of the steamship; Lord Godalming is tending the fire.</t8814> <t8815>He is experienced in this matter, having had one boat on the Thames and another on the Norfolk Broads for many years.</t8815> <t8816>As for our plans, we have finally decided that Mina's predictions are correct and that if the Count has chosen any waterway for his escape to his castle, it would be the Seret and then immediately the Bistriţa beside it.</t8816> <t8817>We thought the crossing of the lands between the river and the Carpathian Mountains would be somewhere near the 47th parallel.</t8817> <t8818>We are not afraid of crossing the river swiftly at night; there is plenty of water making it easy enough to proceed with the steamship even in the dark, and the shores are far enough apart.</t8818> <t8819>Lord Godalming tells me to sleep for a while, as one person keeping watch is sufficient for now.</t8819> <t8820>But I cannot sleep - how can I sleep while my beloved is in that dreadful danger and heading to that terrible place...</t8820> <t8821>My only solace is that we are in God's hands.</t8821> <t8822>With this belief alone, dying and thus escaping all troubles would be easier than living.</t8822> <t8823>Mr. Morris and Dr. Seward had set out on their long journey on horseback before we departed; they will advance until they reach the lands high enough on the right bank of the river to see it and avoid its bends.</t8823> <t8824>In the initial stages, they have two men to ride and manage the spare horses - they are four in total to avoid arousing curiosity.</t8824> <t8825>After sending the men away - which will happen shortly - they will take care of the horses themselves.</t8825> <t8826>The grip of one of the saddles is movable and can be easily adjusted for Mina if necessary.</t8826>
<t8828>We embarked on a wild adventure.</t8828> <t8829>Here, as we hurriedly move through the darkness, we grasp the situation with the cold that seems to rise from the river and hit us, and the mysterious sounds of the night surrounding us.</t8829> <t8830>It feels as if we are being dragged towards unknown places and unknown paths, into a vast world filled with dark and terrifying things.</t8830> <t8831>Godalming is closing the stove door...</t8831>
<t8832>October 31.</t8832> <t8833>- We are still progressing rapidly.</t8833> <t8834>Dawn has broken and Lord Godalming is sleeping.</t8834> <t8835>I am on watch.</t8835> <t8836>In the morning, there is a bitter cold; despite our heavy fur coats, the fire in the stove feels good.</t8836> <t8837>So far, only a few open boats have passed, but none had anything resembling the crate or package we are looking for on their decks.</t8837> <t8838>The men, each time we shone the electric sailor's lantern on them, got scared and fell to their knees, praying.</t8838>
<t8839>November 1, evening.</t8839> <t8840>- No news all day; we found nothing of the sort we were looking for.</t8840> <t8841>We have now moved on to Bistriţa, and if we are wrong in our guess, it means we have lost our chance.</t8841> <t8842>We checked all the boats, big and small.</t8842> <t8843>Early this morning, one of the crew mistook us for a government boat and acted accordingly.</t8843> <t8844>We saw something in this that would make things easier; thus, we obtained a Romanian flag now conspicuously waving at Fundu, where the Bistriţa merges with the Seret.</t8844> <t8845>Since then, this trick has worked on all the boats we have inspected; we are shown every respect and not once have we been opposed in what we ask or want to do.</t8845> <t8846>Some of the Slovaks said that a large boat, which was going faster than usual due to double crew on deck, passed by them.</t8846> <t8847>This was before they reached Fundu, so they couldn't tell if the boat returned to Bistriţa or proceeded up along the Seret.</t8847> <t8848>We heard nothing about such a boat at Fundu; it must have passed there during the night.</t8848> <t8849>I am very sleepy; perhaps the cold is starting to affect me badly, and even nature needs to rest at times.</t8849> <t8850>Godalming insists on taking the first watch.</t8850> <t8851>Thank God for the kindness Godalming has shown to poor Mina and me.</t8851>
<t8852>2</t8852> <t8853>November, morning.</t8853> <t8854>- The weather has brightened up completely.</t8854> <t8855>The kind-hearted man did not wake me up.</t8855> <t8856>He says it would be a sin to wake me up because I slept so peacefully and forgot my troubles.</t8856> <t8857>It feels very selfish to sleep so much and let him keep watch all night, but he was quite right about it.</t8857> <t8858>This morning, I have become a brand new man; sitting here watching Godalming sleep, I can do everything related to looking at the engine, steering, and keeping watch.</t8858> <t8859>I can feel my strength and vigor returning.</t8859> <t8860>I wonder where Mina and Van Helsing are now.</t8860> <t8861>They must have arrived in Veresti by noon on Wednesday.</t8861> <t8862>It will take them some time to find a carriage and horses; so, if they have set off and traveled quickly, they are at Borgo Pass by now.</t8862> <t8863>May God guide and help them!</t8863> <t8864>I am afraid to think of what might happen to them.</t8864> <t8865>I wish we could go faster!</t8865> <t8866>But we cannot; the engines are working hard and doing their best.</t8866> <t8867>I wonder how Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris are progressing.</t8867> <t8868>There are countless streams flowing from the mountains into this river, but none of them are very wide - although they are undoubtedly terrifying in winter and when the snow melts, for now, they are in this state - so the riders must not have encountered too many obstacles.</t8868> <t8869>I hope we can see them before reaching Strasba, because if we haven't caught the Count by then, we may need to come together and discuss what to do next.</t8869>
<t8870>Dr. Seward's journal</t8870>
<t8871>November 2.</t8871> <t8872>- Three days on the road.</t8872> <t8873>No news; even if there were news, there is no time to write it down as every moment is precious.</t8873> <t8874>We only took breaks necessary for the horses; but we both are enduring this very well.</t8874> <t8875>It turns out that our adventure-filled days have been beneficial.</t8875> <t8876>We must speed up; we will never be happy again until we see the steamship once more.</t8876>
<t8877>November 3.</t8877> <t8878>- In Fundu, we learned that the boat was going up the Bistriţa.</t8878> <t8879>I wish the weather wasn't so cold.</t8879> <t8880>There are signs that snow is coming, and if there is heavy snowfall, it will stop us.</t8880> <t8881>In such a case, we would need to get a sled and continue like the Russians.</t8881>
<t8882>November 4.</t8882> <t8883>- Today, we heard that the boat was delayed by an accident while trying to pass a spot where the current sped up.</t8883> <t8884>Slovak boats can navigate against the current without issues with the help of ropes and those who know how to use the rudder.</t8884> <t8885>Some of them set off just a few hours ago.</t8885> <t8886>Godalming himself is an amateur plumber and apparently, he was the one who fixed the boat.</t8886> <t8887>Eventually, with local help, they passed the fast current without issues and returned to tracking.</t8887> <t8888>I'm afraid the boat is not in very good condition due to the accident; the villagers said it stopped occasionally while it remained in sight when it re-entered calm waters.</t8888> <t8889>We must go faster than ever; our help may be needed soon.</t8889>

<t8891>October 31.</t8891> <t8892>- We arrived in Veresti at noon.</t8892> <t8893>The Professor said that he had great difficulty hypnotizing me at dawn this morning and that all I could say was, "dark and silent."</t8893> <t8894>Now he is outside to get a carriage and horses.</t8894> <t8895>He says he will also try to get spare horses so that we can change them on the road later.</t8895> <t8896>We have more than a hundred kilometers ahead of us.</t8896> <t8897>The region is very beautiful and very interesting; how delightful it would have been to see all this if we had come under different circumstances.</t8897> <t8898>What a great pleasure it would have been if Jonathan and I were passing through here alone.</t8898> <t8899>Stopping to see the people, learning something about their lives, filling our minds and memories with all the colors and impressiveness of these wild, beautiful lands and interesting people!</t8899> <t8900>But alas!</t8900>
<t8901>Later.</t8901> <t8902>- Dr. Van Helsing returned.</t8902> <t8903>He got the carriage and horses; we will have dinner and set off within an hour.</t8903> <t8904>Our hostess prepared a huge basket full of provisions for us; it looks like enough to feed an army.</t8904> <t8905>The professor supports the woman and whispers to me that we might not find food for maybe a week.</t8905> <t8906>He also went shopping and sent home a lot of excellent coats and blankets and all kinds of materials to keep warm.</t8906> <t8907>There will be no chance of us getting cold.</t8907>
<t8908>We will be setting off soon.</t8908> <t8909>We are truly in God's hands.</t8909> <t8910>Only He knows what might happen; with all the strength of my sad and humble spirit, I pray that He watches over my dear husband and ensures that, no matter what, Jonathan knows that I love and respect him far more than I can say, and that my last and truest thought will always be of him.</t8910>

<t8912>Mina Harker's journal</t8912>
<t8913>November 1st.</t8913> <t8914>- We were on the road all day and made good progress.</t8914> <t8915>The horses seem to know they are being treated kindly, as they run at their best speed of their own accord.</t8915> <t8916>We have changed so many horses so far and have seen the same thing consistently that we dare to think the journey will be easy.</t8916> <t8917>Dr. Van Helsing speaks briefly and to the point; he tells the farmers that he is in a hurry to get to Bistriţa and pays them well to change the horses.</t8917> <t8918>We drink soup, coffee, or tea and immediately set off again.</t8918> <t8919>It is a very beautiful country; filled with all imaginable beauties, and the people seem brave, strong, simple, and pleasant.</t8919> <t8920>They are very, very superstitious.</t8920> <t8921>At the first house we stopped at, the woman who served us crossed herself when she saw the scar on my forehead and extended two fingers towards me to ward off the evil eye.</t8921> <t8922>I think they have taken the trouble to put extra garlic in our food, and I cannot stand garlic.</t8922> <t8923>Since then, I have been careful not to take off my hat or veil, thus avoiding their suspicions.</t8923> <t8924>We are traveling fast, and since we do not have a driver who carries gossip with him, we are ahead of the gossip; but I can say that the fear of the evil eye follows us all along the way.</t8924> <t8925>The professor seems tireless; despite forcing me to sleep for long periods, he has not rested at all throughout the day.</t8925> <t8926>At sunset, he hypnotized me, and as usual, he says I responded, "Darkness, rushing water, and creaking wood."</t8926> <t8927>I am afraid to think of Jonathan, but somehow I am no longer afraid for him or myself.</t8927> <t8928>I am writing these lines while we wait for the horses to be prepared at a farmhouse.</t8928> <t8929>Dr. Van Helsing is sleeping.</t8929> <t8930>Poor thing, he looks very tired, old, and troubled, but his mouth is set as firmly as that of a conqueror; even in his sleep, he is full of determination.</t8930> <t8931>When we set off, I must ensure he rests while I drive the carriage.</t8931> <t8932>I will tell him that there are still days ahead of us and that he must not be exhausted when his full strength is needed.</t8932> <t8933>Everything is ready, we are setting off shortly.</t8933>
<t8934>2</t8934> <t8935>November, morning.</t8935> <t8936>- I made it and we drove the car in turns all night; morning came, the weather is bright but cold.</t8936> <t8937>There is a strange heaviness in the air - I call it heaviness because I can't find a better word; what I mean is, the air is bothering both of us.</t8937> <t8938>It's very cold and only our warm furs are keeping us comfortable.</t8938> <t8939>At dawn, Van Helsing hypnotized me; he said I responded with “Darkness, creaking wood, and roaring water,” so it means there are changes in the river as they move upstream.</t8939> <t8940>I hope, my dear, that you do not face any danger -more than necessary- but we are in God's hands.</t8940>
<t8941>2</t8941> <t8942>November, night.</t8942> <t8943>- We drove all day.</t8943> <t8944>As we progressed, the region became wilder, and the great peaks of the Carpathian Mountains, which seemed very far from us and very low on the horizon in Veresti, now appear to be coming together and rising before us.</t8944> <t8945>We both seem to be in good spirits; I think we are both trying to cheer each other up, and in doing so, we are cheering ourselves up.</t8945> <t8946>Dr. Van Helsing says we will reach the Borgo Pass by morning.</t8946> <t8947>There are very few houses here now, and the Professor says that the last horses we took will have to stay with us because we might not have the opportunity to change them.</t8947> <t8948>In addition to the two horses we changed, we have two more, so we have roughly four horses.</t8948> <t8949>Dear horses are patient and good-natured, they do not cause us any trouble.</t8949> <t8950>The other travelers do not worry us, and thus even I can drive the carriage.</t8950> <t8951>We will reach the Pass in daylight; we do not want to arrive earlier.</t8951> <t8952>So we are taking it slow and both of us are taking long rests in turns.</t8952> <t8953>Oh, I wonder what tomorrow will bring us?</t8953> <t8954>We will search for the place where my poor beloved suffered greatly.</t8954> <t8955>God, help us to be rightly guided, and may my husband and our loved ones, who are in mortal danger, be watched over by God.</t8955> <t8956>As for me, I am not worthy in His eyes.</t8956> <t8957>Ah! I am a sinner in His eyes, and I will remain so until He allows me to stand before Him as one who has not aroused His wrath.</t8957>
<t8958>Abraham Van Helsing's notes</t8958>
<t8959>November 4th.</t8959> <t8960>- This, in case I cannot see him, to my old and true friend, Doctor John Seward of Purfleet, London.</t8960> <t8961>This may explain everything.</t8961> <t8962>Morning has come, and I am writing by the fire I kept alive all night with the help of Madam Mina.</t8962> <t8963>The weather is cold, cold; so cold that the heavy, gray sky is filled with snow that will spend the entire winter on the ground because the earth has hardened to meet it.</t8963> <t8964>The weather seems to have affected Madam Mina; all day her mind appeared so heavy that she seemed not herself.</t8964> <t8965>Sleeping, sleeping, and sleeping!</t8965> <t8966>Normally very brisk, Madam Mina did literally nothing all day; she even lost her appetite.</t8966> <t8967>Madam Mina, who usually writes with great dedication at every break, did not record anything in her little journal.</t8967> <t8968>Something whispers to me that not everything is alright.</t8968> <t8969>But tonight she is more lively.</t8969> <t8970>Her long sleep has revived and refreshed her, for she is now as sweet and radiant as ever.</t8970> <t8971>At sunset, I try to hypnotize her, but alas!</t8971> <t8972>It doesn’t work; the power has diminished more and more each day, and today it failed me completely.</t8972> <t8973>Well, God’s will be done - whatever it is and wherever it leads us!</t8973>
<t8974>Now, let's come to the historical records, because since Madam Mina does not write in shorthand, I must write using my old cumbersome method, so that not a single day passes without being recorded.</t8974>
<t8975>Yesterday morning, just after sunrise, we arrived at the Borgo Pass.</t8975> <t8976>When I saw the signs of dawn, I prepared for hypnosis.</t8976> <t8977>We stopped our carriage and got out so we wouldn't be disturbed.</t8977> <t8978>I made a bed from furs, and Madam Mina, as usual but slower and for a shorter duration than before, surrendered herself to hypnotic sleep.</t8978> <t8979>The response was the same as before: "Darkness and violently flowing waters."</t8979> <t8980>Then she woke up lively and cheerful, and we continued on our way, soon reaching the Pass.</t8980> <t8981>Right there and then, Madam Mina was seized by a fervent enthusiasm; surely a new guiding force was manifesting itself because she pointed to one of the roads and spoke:</t8981>
<t8982>"From here!"</t8982><t8983>”</t8983>
<t8984>"How do you know?" I asked.</t8984>
<t8985>“Of course I know,” he replied and after pausing for a moment, added: “Didn’t my Jonathan travel and document his journey?</t8985><t8986>”</t8986>
<t8987>At first, it struck me as a bit odd, but soon I thought that there could be only this one side road.</t8987> <t8988>It is used very little; it is very different from the wider, harder, and more practical Bukovina-Bistriţa road.</t8988>
<t8989>Thus, we embarked on this path; when other paths appeared before us - we were not always sure they were paths because they were neglected and lightly covered with snow - the horses knew where to go, in fact, only they knew.</t8989><t8990>I left the reins to them, and they proceeded with great patience.</t8990><t8991>Soon, we found everything Jonathan had noted in his astonishing journal.</t8991><t8992>Then we progressed for long, long, long hours.</t8992><t8993>At first, I told Madam Mina to sleep; she tried and succeeded.</t8993><t8994>She kept sleeping until I became suspicious and tried to wake her.</t8994><t8995>But she continued to sleep, and despite my efforts, I couldn't wake her.</t8995><t8996>I didn't want to push too hard to avoid hurting her because I knew she was suffering greatly and that sleep was everything to her at times.</t8996><t8997>I think I must have fallen asleep too, because suddenly I felt guilty as if I had done something wrong; I found myself sitting upright with the reins in my hands, and the good-natured horses were trotting along slowly as usual.</t8997><t8998>I looked down and saw that Madam Mina was still asleep.</t8998><t8999>There wasn't much time left until sunset, and the sunlight was streaming over the snow like a great yellow flood, casting huge, long shadows where the mountain rose steeply.</t8999><t9000>Because we kept going up, up without stopping, and everything was so wild and rocky as if we had reached the end of the world!</t9000>
<t9001>Then I wake Madam Mina.</t9001> <t9002>This time she wakes up without much trouble, and then I try to put her into a hypnotic sleep.</t9002> <t9003>It's as if she's not trying to sleep.</t9003> <t9004>Still, I keep trying, trying; until suddenly I find both of us in the dark; so I look around and see that the sun has set.</t9004> <t9005>Madam Mina laughs; I turn and look at her.</t9005> <t9006>She is now quite awake and looks better than I have seen her since the night we first entered the Count's house in Carfax.</t9006> <t9007>I am surprised and feel uneasy at that moment; but she is so lively, so gentle and thoughtful towards me that I forget all fears.</t9007> <t9008>Since we brought wood with us, I make a fire; she prepares food while I untie, rest, secure, and feed the horses.</t9008> <t9009>Then, when I return to the fire, my meal is ready.</t9009> <t9010>I go to help her; but she laughs and says she has already eaten - she was so hungry that she couldn't wait.</t9010> <t9011>I don't like this, I have great doubts, but I am afraid of alarming her and so I say nothing.</t9011> <t9012>She helps me, and I eat my meal alone; then we wrap ourselves in furs and lie down by the fire, and I tell her to sleep while I keep watch.</t9012> <t9013>But I immediately forget that I am keeping watch, and when I suddenly remember, I find Madam Mina lying quietly but awake, looking at me with shining eyes.</t9013> <t9014>The same thing happened a couple more times, and I got quite a bit of sleep until morning.</t9014> <t9015>When I woke up, I tried to hypnotize her, but alas!</t9015> <t9016>Even though she obediently closed her eyes, she couldn't sleep.</t9016> <t9017>The sun rose higher and higher, her sleep came very late, but it was such a heavy sleep that she wouldn't wake up.</t9017> <t9018>When I had harnessed the horses and prepared everything, I had to lift her and place her in the carriage.</t9018> <t9019>Madam is still sleeping, sleeping, and in her sleep, she looks healthier and redder than before.</t9019> <t9020>And I don't like this.</t9020> <t9021>And I am afraid, afraid, afraid!</t9021> <t9022>(I am afraid of everything.</t9022><t9023>)</t9023> <t9024>I am even afraid to think, but I must continue on my way.</t9024> <t9025>This task we have undertaken is a matter of life and death, even more, and we must not retreat.</t9025>
<t9026>November 5, morning.</t9026> <t9027>- Let me write everything down completely, because even though you and I have seen some strange things together, you might think at first that I - Van Helsing - have gone mad, that after so much horror and tension in the nerves, my mind has become clouded.</t9027>
<t9028>Yesterday, we were on the road all day and we are getting closer and closer to the mountains, advancing towards wilder and more desolate lands.</t9028><t9029>There are alarming steep cliffs with waterfalls, and it seems as if Nature occasionally holds a carnival here.</t9029><t9030>Madam Mina is still sleeping, sleeping; despite getting hungry and feeding myself, I couldn't wake her up - not even for food.</t9030><t9031>Since she is tainted by the vampire's baptism, I began to fear that the deadly enchantment of this place might take hold of her.</t9031><t9032>"Well!" I said to myself, "If she is going to sleep all day, then I will not sleep all night."</t9032><t9033>As we progressed on the rugged road - because the road was very old and broken - I bowed my head and slept.</t9033><t9034>I woke up again with a feeling of guilt and a sense that a lot of time had passed; I saw that Madam Mina was still sleeping and the sun had considerably lowered.</t9034><t9035>But actually, everything had changed; the angry mountains seemed farther away, and we were in the high regions of a steep hill with a castle on its summit similar to the one described in Jonathan's journal.</t9035><t9036>At the same time, I was both happy and scared; because now, for better or worse, the end was near.</t9036><t9037>I woke Madam Mina and tried to hypnotize her again, but alas!</t9037><t9038>I couldn't succeed until it was too late.</t9038><t9039>Then, before the great darkness fell upon us - because even after sunset, the sky continued to reflect the setting sun on the snow, and everywhere was enveloped in a great twilight for a while - I untied the horses and fed them in a shelter I could find.</t9039><t9040>Then I lit a fire, and made Madam Mina, who was now awake and looking more attractive than ever, sit comfortably among her blankets.</t9040><t9041>I prepared the meal, but she didn't eat, merely saying she wasn't hungry.</t9041><t9042>Knowing it would be of no use, I didn't force her.</t9042><t9043>But I ate, because now I must be strong for everyone.</t9043><t9044>Then, fearing what might happen, I drew a wide circle around the place where Madam Mina was sitting for her comfort; I sprinkled some blessed bread over the circle and crumbled it well so that everywhere would be well protected.</t9044><t9045>Madam Mina sat all this time - motionless like the dead; her color turned white, white until she looked paler than the snow, and not a single word came out of her mouth.</t9045><t9046>But when I approached her, she clung to me, and I knew the poor thing was trembling from head to toe with great, painful terror.</t9046><t9047>When she became even quieter, I immediately said:</t9047>
<t9048>“Aren't you going to come near the fire?” Because I wanted to see what he could do.</t9048> <t9049>He stood up obediently, but when he took a step, he stopped and remained as if struck.</t9049>
<t9050>“Why don't you continue?” I asked.</t9050> <t9051>He shook his head from side to side and quietly returned to his seat.</t9051> <t9052>Then, like someone who had just woken up, he opened his eyes and looked at me, saying:</t9052>
<t9053>“I can't!” And he fell silent.</t9053> <t9054>I was relieved because I knew the things he couldn't do, and he couldn't do the things we were afraid he would.</t9054> <t9055>Even if his body was in danger, his soul was still safe!</t9055>
<t9056>At that moment, the horses began to neigh and tug at their reins; until I went to them and calmed them down.</t9056> <t9057>When they felt my hands on them, they whinnied softly as if they were happy, licked my hands, and stood still for a while.</t9057> <t9058>Throughout the night, until that cold hour when all of nature slowed down, I went to them many times, and each time my presence calmed them.</t9058> <t9059>At that cold hour, the fire began to die, and I was about to step out of the circle to revive it; because the snow was sweeping everything with an icy mist.</t9059> <t9060>Even in the darkness, there was light on the snow; it was as if the snowstorm and mist rings were turning into women wearing dresses with fluttering skirts.</t9060> <t9061>Everything was in deathly silence; only the horses were whimpering and cowering as if fearing the worst.</t9061> <t9062>I began to be afraid - terrifying fears; but then I felt the safety within the circle I stood in.</t9062> <t9063>I started to think that the night, the gloom, the unease I felt, and all those dreadful anxieties were causing me to dream.</t9063> <t9064>It was as if my memories of Jonathan's terrible experience were deceiving me, because the snowflakes and mist began to form circles, until the shadowy figures of those women who might have kissed Jonathan appeared.</t9064> <t9065>And then the horses cowered even more in fear, whimpering with terror like people in agony.</t9065> <t9066>They were not even in a state to escape from there in the madness of fear.</t9066> <t9067>When these strange shapes came closer and began to circle around, I feared for dear Madam Mina.</t9067> <t9068>I looked at her, but she was sitting calmly and smiling at me; I was about to take a step to stoke the fire when she caught me and pulled me back, whispering softly like one hears in dreams:</t9068>
<t9069>“No! No! Don't go out! You are safe here!” I turned to him and said, looking into his eyes:</t9069>
<t9070>"Well, what about you?</t9070> <t9071>I'm afraid for you!" When he heard this, he laughed, it was a low and surreal laugh, and he said:</t9071>
<t9072>“Are you afraid for me?</t9072> <t9073>Why are you afraid for me?</t9073> <t9074>There is no one in the whole world who is safer than I am against them.”</t9074> <t9075>While I was wondering about the meaning of his words, a sudden gust of wind flared the fire and I saw the red scar on his forehead.</t9075> <t9076>That was when, ah! I understood! If I hadn’t understood then, I would soon learn, because the shapes of swirling mist and snow approached but always kept away from the sacred circle.</t9076> <t9077>Then they began to materialize, until -if God hasn’t taken my mind- I saw with my own eyes the same three women Jonathan had seen in the room, trying to kiss his throat, standing before me in flesh and blood.</t9077> <t9078>I recognized their swaying round forms, their gleaming hard eyes, their white teeth, their red cheeks, and their lustful lips.</t9078> <t9079>They laughed at poor dear Madam Mina, and as their laughter pierced the silence of the night, they entwined their arms and pointed at her, speaking in those sweet ringing voices that Jonathan compared to the unbearable sweetness of clinking water glasses:</t9079>
<t9080>"Come, my brother.</t9080> <t9081>Come to us.</t9081> <t9082>Come! Come!" I turned to my dear Madam Mina in fear, and my heart leapt as if it had burst into flames of joy; for oh!</t9082> <t9083>The fear, disgust, and horror in her sweet eyes told a story to my heart filled entirely with hope.</t9083> <t9084>Thank God she had not yet become one of them.</t9084> <t9085>I took a few of the logs beside me and, extending some of the blessed bread forward, I advanced towards them from across the fire.</t9085> <t9086>They retreated before me and laughed with their low, terrifying laughter.</t9086> <t9087>I fed the fire and was not afraid of them, for I knew we were safe among our precautions.</t9087> <t9088>As long as I was armed in this way, they could not approach me or Madam Mina, who was within the circle they could not enter or leave.</t9088> <t9089>The horses stopped groaning and lay still on the ground; snow was gently falling on them, and the horses turned completely white.</t9089> <t9090>I knew there was nothing more for the poor animals to fear.</t9090>
<t9091>We stayed like that until the redness of dawn began to fall upon the gloom of the snow.</t9091> <t9092>I was in a state of misery and fear, filled with sorrow and dread, but once that beautiful sun began to climb the horizon again, a surge of life energy filled me.</t9092> <t9093>With the first arrival of dawn, those dreadful shapes melted away into the swirling mist and snow; crowns of transparent gloom advanced towards the castle and disappeared from sight.</t9093>
<t9094>With the breaking of dawn, I instinctively turned to Madam Mina to hypnotize her, but she had fallen into a deep and sudden sleep, and I couldn't wake her.</t9094> <t9095>I tried to hypnotize her in her sleep, but she didn't respond at all, and morning came.</t9095> <t9096>I am still afraid to move.</t9096> <t9097>I lit my fire and saw the horses; they were all dead.</t9097> <t9098>I have a lot of work to do here today, and I am waiting until the sun rises fully, because although the snow and mist obscure it, I may need to go to some places where daylight will be my assurance.</t9098>
<t9099>I will gather my strength with breakfast and then set to my dreadful task.</t9099> <t9100>Madam Mina is still sleeping, and thank God she is calm in her sleep.</t9100>

<t9115>November 5th.</t9115> <t9116>- At dawn, we saw the Gypsy caravan speeding away from the river in a car.</t9116> <t9117>They were surrounding the car and moving swiftly.</t9117> <t9118>It was lightly snowing, and there was a strange excitement in the air.</t9118> <t9119>This could be our own excited feelings, but the anxiety is peculiar.</t9119> <t9120>I hear the wolves howling in the distance; the snow carries these sounds down from the mountains, and there is danger for all of us from every direction.</t9120> <t9121>The horses are almost ready, and we will set off very soon.</t9121> <t9122>We are heading towards someone's death.</t9122> <t9123>Only God knows who, where, when, or how someone will die...</t9123>
<t9124>Dr. Van Helsing's notes</t9124>
<t9125>November 5, late afternoon.</t9125> <t9126>- At least my sanity is intact.</t9126> <t9127>Though proving it was horrifying, I still thank God for His mercy.</t9127> <t9128>I left Madam Mina sleeping within the holy circle and set off towards the castle.</t9128> <t9129>The blacksmith's hammer I took from the carriage in Veresti came in handy; despite all the doors being open, I broke them off their rusty hinges so that no ill will or bad luck could close them and trap me inside.</t9129> <t9130>Here, Jonathan's painful experience helped me.</t9130> <t9131>Remembering his journal, I found the way to the old chapel, for I knew where my task lay.</t9131> <t9132>The air was very oppressive; from time to time, it seemed to emit a sulfurous gas that made my head spin.</t9132> <t9133>Either there was a ringing in my ears, or I was hearing the howling of wolves from afar.</t9133> <t9134>Then I reminded myself of dear Madam Mina and felt very distressed.</t9134> <t9135>This dilemma pressed upon me.</t9135> <t9136>I dared not bring her here, but I left her safe from the Vampire within the holy circle; yet even there, there could be wolves!</t9136> <t9137>I decided that my task was here and if it was God's will, we must surrender to the wolves.</t9137> <t9138>Beyond this, there was death and salvation.</t9138> <t9139>Thus, I made the choice on her behalf.</t9139> <t9140>If it were for myself, the choice would be easy; better to lie in the belly of the wolf than in the Vampire's grave!</t9140> <t9141>Thus, I decided to continue with my task.</t9141>
<t9142>I knew there were at least three graves to be found, used graves; so, I searched, searched, and found one.</t9142> <t9143>The vampire was in its sleep; it had such a beauty so full of life and bodily desire that I shuddered as if I had come to commit murder.</t9143> <t9144>Ah! In the old days, when such things happened, I have no doubt that many men who set out to fulfill a duty like mine eventually realized that their hearts and then their nerves failed them halfway.</t9144> <t9145>Thus, they would keep postponing their duty until the frivolous Undead hypnotized them, and they would wait, wait there until sunset and the Vampire’s sleep ended.</t9145> <t9146>Then, the beautiful eyes of that charming woman would open, look lovingly, and offer her lustful lips for a kiss; the man would be powerless.</t9146> <t9147>Thus, another victim would join the vampire horde; the merciless and terrifying ranks of the Undead would increase by one more.</t9147> <t9148>There is undoubtedly an enchantment; even while lying in a grave decayed over time and heavy with the dust of centuries, accompanied by that dreadful smell similar to the one in the Count’s secret lair, I am affected by the presence of such a being.</t9148> <t9149>Yes, I was affected -I, Van Helsing, despite my entire purpose and reason for hatred- I was affected by a desire to delay that paralyzed my faculties and hindered my soul.</t9149> <t9150>My need for natural sleep and the strange pressure in the air might be taking hold of me.</t9150> <t9151>Undoubtedly, I was falling into sleep -the open-eyed sleep of someone who desires sweet enchantment- when a long, low moan full of great sorrow and pain, cutting through the air silenced by the snow, woke me like a trumpet sound.</t9151> <t9152>For this was the voice of my dear Madam Mina that I heard.</t9152>
<t9153>Then, I gathered strength for my dreadful task and, by forcibly lifting the tomb lids, I found another of the sisters, the other brunette.</t9153> <t9154>So that I would not begin to be enchanted once more, I did not dare to stop to look at her as I had done with the other sister, but continued my search until I found her in a large, high tomb that seemed made for that dear blonde sister who materialized from the atoms of the mist as Jonathan had seen.</t9154> <t9155>She had such a pure appearance, such dazzling beauty, such graceful sensuality that the masculine instinct within me, which calls my kind to love and protect one of her kind, caused my head to spin with a new feeling.</t9155> <t9156>But thank God, the cry of my dear Madam Mina's soul had not yet faded from my ears, and before the spell could further take hold of me, I gathered my courage for my savage duty.</t9156> <t9157>By this time, I had searched all the tombs I could find in the chapel; since there were only two Undead specters around us at night, I concluded that there were no other active Undead at the moment.</t9157> <t9158>There was a single tomb more magnificent than all the other tombs; it was giant and had noble proportions.</t9158> <t9159>On it was inscribed a single word:</t9159>
<t9160>DRACULA</t9160>
<t9161>So, this was the "Undead Lair of the Vampire King," to which many things were connected.</t9161> <t9162>The empty grave meaningfully told me that something I already knew was true.</t9162> <t9163>Through my dreadful task, before sending these women to their own deaths, I placed some blessed bread in Dracula's grave, thus banishing him from that grave forever while he was in his Undead state.</t9163>
<t9164>Then, my dreadful task began, I was afraid of this.</t9164> <t9165>If there had been only one, it would have been relatively easy.</t9165> <t9166>But three! To start twice more after committing a horrifying act; if it was dreadful with sweet Miss Lucy, who knows how it would be with these strangers who have survived for centuries and grown stronger over the years, who would fight for their vile lives if they could...</t9166>
<t9167>Ah, my friend John!</t9167> <t9168>This is butchery!</t9168> <t9169>If I hadn't gathered my courage by thinking of other dead and those living with such a shroud of fear over them, I wouldn't have been able to continue my work.</t9169> <t9170>Even after it all ended, I keep trembling, thank God my nerves endured it.</t9170> <t9171>If I hadn't seen the peace indicating the soul was reclaimed, the satisfaction spreading across the face before the final dissolution, I couldn't have continued my butchery.</t9171> <t9172>I couldn't bear that horrifying scream heard as the stake was driven in, the lunges of the writhing form, and the blood-filled frothy lips.</t9172> <t9173>I would flee in terror and leave my work unfinished.</t9173> <t9174>But it's all over!</t9174> <t9175>And thinking that in that brief moment before their annihilation, each of them appeared docile in their true death sleep, I can pity them and shed tears for them.</t9175> <t9176>Because, my friend John, it was as if the death that should have come centuries ago finally appeared and suddenly declared loudly, "I am He!" before each of their heads was freshly severed, and their entire body crumbled and merged back into the soil from which it came.</t9176>
<t9177>Before leaving the castle, I arranged the entrances so that the Count could never enter there again as the Undead.</t9177>
<t9178>As soon as I stepped into the circle where Madam Mina was sleeping, she woke up from her sleep and let out such a scream of pain upon seeing me that it was hard to bear.</t9178>
<t9179>“Come!” she said, “come, let's get away from this dreadful place!</t9179> <t9180>Let's go meet my husband, whom I know is coming towards us.”</t9180> <t9181>She looked weak, pale, and frail, but her eyes were pure and shone with enthusiasm.</t9181> <t9182>I was glad to see her paleness and illness, because my mind was filled with fresh fears about the rosy-cheeked vampire's sleep.</t9182>
<t9183>And so, with trust and hope, but still filled with fear, we advanced eastward to meet our friends - and him; because Madam Mina says she knows they are coming to meet us.</t9183>
<t9184>Mina Harker's diary</t9184>
<t9185>November 6.</t9185> <t9186>- It was almost evening when the Professor and I started heading east, knowing that Jonathan had arrived.</t9186> <t9187>Despite the steep downhill slope of the road, we weren't going fast because we had to take heavy blankets and shawls with us; we couldn't dare face the possibility of not having something to keep us warm in the cold and snow.</t9187> <t9188>We also had to take some of our supplies with us, because we were in a completely desolate place and, as far as we could see through the falling snow, there was no sign of any settlement in sight.</t9188> <t9189>After advancing about two kilometers, I got tired from the heavy walk and sat down to rest.</t9189> <t9190>Then we looked back and saw the place where the distinct outlines of Dracula's castle cut the sky, because we were so far down the hill it stood on that the perspective of the Carpathian Mountains was well below the castle.</t9190> <t9191>We saw it in all its glory, perched atop a three-hundred-meter-deep precipice; it seemed as if there was a great void between it and the summit of any adjacent mountain.</t9191> <t9192>There was something wild and sinister about this place.</t9192> <t9193>We could hear the howling of wolves in the distance.</t9193> <t9194>They were very far away, but even muffled by the deafening snow, their voices were filled with terror.</t9194> <t9195>I knew from Dr. Van Helsing's exploration of the surroundings that he was trying to find a strategic point where we would be less exposed in case of an attack.</t9195> <t9196>The rough road still stretched downward; we could trace it partly from the accumulated snow.</t9196>
<t9197>Soon after, the Professor signaled to me, and I stood up and went to him.</t9197> <t9198>He had found a perfect spot, a kind of natural hollow with an entrance like a door between two large rocks.</t9198> <t9199>He took my hand and led me inside: "Look!" he said, "You will be safe here, and if the wolves come, I can face them one by one."</t9199> <t9200>He carried our furs inside, prepared a secure nest for me, and tried to force me to eat some provisions.</t9200> <t9201>But I couldn't eat; even attempting it was repulsive to me, and although I wanted to please him, I couldn't bring myself to try.</t9201> <t9202>He looked very sad, but he did not scold me.</t9202> <t9203>He took his binoculars out of the bag, stood on top of the rock, and began to look at the horizon.</t9203> <t9204>Suddenly, he shouted:</t9204>
<t9205>"Look! Madam Mina! Look! Look!" I jumped up from my place and stood beside him on the rock; he handed me his binoculars and pointed.</t9205> <t9206>The snow was now falling even more heavily, and the fierce snowflakes were swirling as if caught in a vortex, because a strong wind had started to blow.</t9206> <t9207>But there were occasional gaps in the heavy snowfall, and I could see a long distance.</t9207> <t9208>From our height, it was possible to see a great range; in the distance, beyond the empty snowy fields, I could see the river winding like a black ribbon.</t9208> <t9209>Right in front of us and not very far away - in fact, so close that I wondered why we hadn't noticed them before - a group of horsemen was advancing rapidly.</t9209> <t9210>In the middle of them was a carriage, a long wagon that swayed from side to side with every bump in the road, like a dog's wagging tail.</t9210> <t9211>Since they stood out clearly against the snow, I could tell from the men's clothing that they were either peasants or Gypsies.</t9211>
<t9212>There was a large square chest in the car.</t9212> <t9213>My heart skipped a beat when I saw it, because I felt that the end had come.</t9213> <t9214>Evening was falling, and by that time, that Thing which had been imprisoned here would regain its freedom and escape all pursuits.</t9214> <t9215>I turned to the Professor in fear; I was very surprised not to see the Professor there.</t9215> <t9216>A second later, I saw him down below.</t9216> <t9217>He drew a circle around the rock, similar to the one we had taken refuge in last night.</t9217> <t9218>When he completed the drawing, he came back to me and said:</t9218>
<t9219>"At least here you will be safe from him!” He took the binoculars from me and, once the snow had stopped again, he scanned the area beneath us thoroughly.</t9219> <t9220>"Look,” he said, "they are coming fast; they are whipping their horses and galloping as fast as they can.”</t9220> <t9221>He paused and continued speaking in a muffled voice:</t9221>
<t9222>"They are running for the sunset."</t9222> <t9223>"We might be too late."</t9223> <t9224>"God’s will shall be done!”</t9224> <t9225>A blinding snowstorm came from below again and the entire landscape disappeared under the snow.</t9225> <t9226>But the storm passed quickly and once again the Professor's binoculars were fixed on the opening ahead of us.</t9226> <t9227>That's when the Professor suddenly shouted:</t9227>
<t9228>"Look! Look! Look! Look, two horsemen are rapidly coming from the south.</t9228> <t9229>It must be Quincey and John.</t9229> <t9230>Take the binoculars.</t9230> <t9231>Look before the snow hides everything!” I took the binoculars and looked.</t9231> <t9232>The two men coming could be Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris.</t9232> <t9233>In any case, I knew that neither of them was Jonathan.</t9233> <t9234>At the same time, I knew Jonathan wasn't far away; when I looked around, I saw two other men coming at lightning speed to the north of the approaching group.</t9234> <t9235>I knew one of them was Jonathan and concluded that the other was, of course, Lord Godalming.</t9235> <t9236>They were also chasing the group with the carriage.</t9236> <t9237>When I told this to the Professor, he shouted with joy like a schoolboy and, after watching carefully until the snow reduced visibility to zero, he propped his Winchester rifle against the rock at the entrance of our shelter and got it ready.</t9237> <t9238>“They are getting closer to each other,” he said.</t9238> <t9239>“When the time comes, we will see Gypsies everywhere.”</t9239> <t9240>I took my pistol in hand to use, because as we talked, the howling of the wolves grew stronger and closer.</t9240> <t9241>When the snowstorm subsided for a moment, we looked again.</t9241> <t9242>It was strange to see the snow falling around us in such large flakes and the sun shining even brighter as it set over the peaks of the distant mountains.</t9242> <t9243>When I scanned the surroundings with the binoculars, I saw dots moving here and there, in pairs, in threes, and in large groups - the wolves were gathering for their prey.</t9243>
<t9244>Every second we waited felt like a year.</t9244> <t9245>The wind was increasing in intensity, and the snowflakes swirling around us, creating small vortices, were being driven with great fury.</t9245> <t9246>At times, we couldn't even see the tip of our noses, but at other times, as the wind passed by with its echoing sound, it seemed to clear the airspace around us so we could see into the distance.</t9246> <t9247>We had become so accustomed to waiting for sunrise and sunset lately that we could predict exactly when it would happen, and we knew that the sun would set very soon.</t9247>
<t9248>It was hard to believe that our watches showed we had been waiting in that rocky shelter for less than half an hour until the newcomers began to approach us closely.</t9248> <t9249>The wind was now blowing more violently and harshly, mostly coming from the north.</t9249> <t9250>Apparently, the wind had driven the snow clouds away from us, because now there were only occasional bursts of snow.</t9250> <t9251>We could easily distinguish the members of both groups, those being chased and those doing the chasing.</t9251> <t9252>The strange thing was that the ones being chased seemed unaware of their pursuers or at least didn't care, but as the sun descended over the mountain peaks, they seemed to double their speed.</t9252>
<t9253>They were getting closer and closer.</t9253> <t9254>The Professor and I crouched behind our rock and took our weapons in hand; I could see that the Professor was determined not to let them pass through here.</t9254> <t9255>They were all unaware of our presence.</t9255>
<t9256>At the same time, two voices shouted, "Stop!"</t9256> <t9257>One of the voices was Jonathan's, high-pitched with anger; the other was Mr. Morris's, strong, determined, and calm in command.</t9257> <t9258>The Gypsies might not have known the language, but it was impossible to misunderstand the tone, no matter what language the words were spoken in; instinctively, they pulled the reins, and at that moment, Lord Godalming and Jonathan attacked from one side, while Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris attacked from the other.</t9258> <t9259>The chief, a magnificent-looking man sitting on his horse like a Centaur, signaled them to go with his hand and angrily commanded his companions to advance.</t9259> <t9260>They whipped their horses, and the horses surged forward; but the four men raised their Winchester rifles and unmistakably ordered them to stop.</t9260> <t9261>At the same time, Dr. Van Helsing and I stood up from behind the rock and aimed our weapons at the Gypsies.</t9261> <t9262>Seeing they were surrounded, they pulled the reins and stopped.</t9262> <t9263>Their leader turned to them and said something, upon which each of the Gypsies drew their weapon - knife or pistol - and stood ready to attack.</t9263> <t9264>An argument ensued instantly.</t9264>
<t9265>The leader of the community spurred his horse forward with a swift movement of the reins and, pointing first to the sun, which was now approaching the hills, and then to the castle, uttered some words I did not understand.</t9265> <t9266>In response, four men from our team dismounted from their horses and quickly ran towards the carriage.</t9266> <t9267>When I saw Jonathan putting himself in such danger, I should have been horrified, but the fire of battle must have affected me like the others; I felt no fear, only a wild and great desire to do something.</t9267> <t9268>Seeing the quick movement of our team, the chieftain gave an order; his men instantly formed an undisciplined circle around the carriage, each one pushing and shoving the other to carry out the command.</t9268>
<t9269>In the midst of all this, I could see Jonathan on one side of the circle of men and Quincey on the other, trying to clear a path to the carriage; it was clear they were determined to finish their work before sunset.</t9269> <t9270>Nothing could stop or even hinder them.</t9270> <t9271>Neither the guns and gleaming knives aimed by the Gypsies in front, nor the howling of the wolves behind seemed to catch their attention.</t9271> <t9272>Jonathan's boldness and evident determination seemed to have frightened and subdued those in front of him.</t9272> <t9273>In an instant, he jumped onto the carriage and, with what seemed like extraordinary strength, lifted the large chest and hurled it to the ground over the wheel.</t9273> <t9274>Meanwhile, Mr. Morris had to use force to get through the Gypsy circle on his side.</t9274> <t9275>During the time I watched Jonathan breathlessly, I saw out of the corner of my eye that Mr. Morris, in desperation, lunged forward and made a path through them, the Gypsies' knives flashing and stabbing him.</t9275> <t9276>He fended off the attacks with his large hunting knife, and at first, I thought he had safely overcome it, but then I saw him leap to Jonathan's side, who had jumped down from the carriage, clutching his side tightly with his left hand and blood gushing between his fingers.</t9276> <t9277>Still, he did not stop, for as Jonathan, in desperation, used the large kukri to pry open the lid from one end of the chest, Mr. Morris, in a frenzy, attacked the other end with his hunting knife.</t9277> <t9278>With the efforts of both men, the lid began to give way; the nails were pulled out with a sharp, scream-like creak, and the lid of the chest was thrown back.</t9278>
<t9279>At this moment, seeing that they were surrounded by Winchesters and at the mercy of Lord Godalming and Dr. Seward, the Gypsies gave up and ceased to resist.</t9279> <t9280>The sun had almost descended from the mountain peaks, and the long shadows of the entire group were cast upon the snow.</t9280> <t9281>I saw the Count lying on the soil that had spilled partially over him due to the hard fall from the cart.</t9281> <t9282>He was pale as death, resembling a mummy, and his red eyes shone with that terrible vengeful look I knew so well.</t9282>
<t9283>While looking at her, those eyes saw the setting sun and the expression of hatred turned into triumph.</t9283>
<t9284>But at that moment came the speed and brightness of Jonathan's large knife.</t9284> <t9285>I screamed when I saw the knife cut the throat; at the same time, Mr. Morris's hunting knife also plunged into the heart.</t9285>
<t9286>Everything that happened was like a miracle, but right before our eyes and in almost a single breath, the entire body turned to dust and disappeared from sight.</t9286> <t9287>Even in that final moment of death, I will be grateful for as long as I live that there was an expression of peace on that face that I could never have imagined.</t9287>
<t9288>Dracula's Castle now stood facing the red sky, and each stone of its broken battlements was emerging one by one in the light of the setting sun.</t9288>
<t9289>In some way, the Gypsies, who saw us as the reason for the extraordinary disappearance of the dead man, turned their backs without a word and moved away as if they wanted to save their lives.</t9289> <t9290>Those without horses jumped onto the horse-drawn carriage and shouted at the riders not to leave them behind.</t9290> <t9291>The wolves, which had pulled back to a safe distance, left us alone and followed them.</t9291>
<t9292>Mr. Morris, who had collapsed to the ground, was leaning on his elbow, holding the hand pressed against his side; blood was still gushing from between his fingers.</t9292> <t9293>I ran to his side, for the sacred circle no longer held me back; both doctors also ran to Mr. Morris.</t9293> <t9294>Jonathan knelt beside him, and the wounded man rested his head on Jonathan's shoulder.</t9294> <t9295>With a sigh and a feeble effort, he took my hand in his unbloodied one.</t9295> <t9296>He must have seen the pain in my heart on my face, for he was looking at me and smiling as he spoke:</t9296>
<t9297>“I am so happy to have been of use!”</t9297> <t9298>“Oh, my God!” he suddenly shouted; struggling to sit up and showing me something, “It was worth dying for this!</t9298> <t9299>Look! Look!”</t9299>
<t9300>The sun had now descended to the very peak of the mountain, and its red rays were falling on my face; it was as if my face was being bathed in a pink light.</t9300> <t9301>As the dying man continued to speak, all the men who were following his finger with their eyes suddenly dropped to their knees, and a deep and heartfelt "Amen!" was heard from all of them.</t9301>
<t9302>"Now, thank God that all this was not in vain!"</t9302> <t9303>"Look! Now, the snow is not more spotless than his forehead!"</t9303> <t9304>"The curse is lifted!"</t9304><t9305>"</t9305>
<t9306>And leaving us in great pain, smiling and in silence, the brave gentleman died.</t9306>
<t9307>Not</t9307>
<t9308>Seven years ago, we all went through fire, and since then, some of us believe that the happiness we have now is worth the pain we endured.</t9308> <t9309>The fact that our son's birthday is on the same day Quincey Morris died gives Mina and me extra joy.</t9309> <t9310>I know that his mother has a secret belief that a part of our brave friend's spirit has passed into him.</t9310> <t9311>The bundle of names he carries ties our small community together, but we call him Quincey.</t9311>
<t9312>This summer, we took a journey to Transylvania and went to that old place which holds -and still holds- very vivid and terrifying memories for all of us.</t9312> <t9313>It was almost impossible to believe that the things we saw with our own eyes and heard with our own ears were vivid realities.</t9313> <t9314>The traces of everything that happened had been erased.</t9314> <t9315>The castle was standing as before, rising over the desolation.</t9315>
<t9316>When we returned home, we began to talk about the old times, which we no longer remember with sorrow because Godalming and Seward had happy marriages.</t9316> <t9317>I took the documents out of the safe where they had been since we returned long ago.</t9317> <t9318>We were horrified by the fact that there were almost no original documents among all this pile of material where the records were arranged; apart from Mina's, Seward's, and my later journals and Van Helsing's notes, there was nothing but a heap of typewritten papers.</t9318> <t9319>Even if we had such a desire, we could not ask anyone to accept these documents as evidence of such a wild story.</t9319> <t9320>Van Helsing, with our son sitting on his knee, summarized the matter as follows:</t9320>
<t9321>“We don't need evidence; we don't want anyone to believe us!</t9321> <t9322>This child will one day know how brave and valiant his mother was.</t9322> <t9323>He already knows her sweetness and warm attention; later, he will understand how some men loved her and how they defied many things for her sake.</t9323><t9324>”</t9324>
